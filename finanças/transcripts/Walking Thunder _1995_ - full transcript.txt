(gentle music) (bear growls) (majestic music) - Hi Marj, we're here. How are you? - Hello darling. - Thank you so much for doing this for us. - There's my guy. Ooh. You've grown so much. Ooh, so big. Come on. - Thanks mom. You've got the package? And you think he'll read it? - You did. He's no more spoiled than you were. - A good report. We'll be up in the mountains next weekend. - Love you, sweetheart. - That sounds like a pretty square deal. Do you like camping? - He'll find a reason to miss it. Business trip or something. Come on. - What? - Help me with something. Open this. Oh, your father used to love to play with all this old stuff. When he was little. - What is it? - It's a dream catcher. Your great, great grandfather got this from a Sioux medicine man. Set great store by it. - Indians. Wow! What does it do? - Catches dreams. What'd you think? (sighs) All of Jacob McKay's life is in this box. Don't cut your ear off. That's a scalping knife. - Real scalps. - Are there other kinds? If you like that, you're gonna love this. - Wow. Does it shoot? - I suspect it does. - What was he like? Jacob, I mean. - Jacob McKay was a boy about your age when he came West. It's all right here. - A diary? - Journal. It was your grandpa's, then your fathers, now it's yours. - Mine? - You're a McKay. It's important for you to know about your people, your family. Read this. - A great animal is like crashing thunder (mysterious music) or maybe the sound of roaring wind. (dramatic tense music) (bear roaring) (bear roaring) (gasps) Whoa! - [Jacob Voiceover] As I, Jacob McKay, write these words, I'm in my 75th year. To you, my posterity, my family yet unborn, I leave a record of the most significant events in my life. Events that changed me and my thinking forever. I was only 14 in the year 1850, and that was the year our family came West. My father, John McKay had been a shipwright in New Hampshire his entire life. So he decided to make a new beginning for the family in the gold fields of California. It was late in the fall and we'd been left behind by the rest of the wagon train. My mother's name was Emma. She was a strong and willful woman, but a loving and caring person. I don't think she was too happy to leave. She was expecting a third child and the trip had been hard for her. My younger brother Toby was excited about coming. He loved it. And I guess I did too. I'd read quite a lot about the West. of all the things I wanted to see, I wanted to see a real mountain man more than anything in the world. My family had sold everything before we began the trip. When I left New Hampshire my school master gave me this journal to record an account of the journey. Mother's been sick and forced us to stop while she regained her strength. What little my parents owned, it all fit into one small wagon. - Hold up here. Whoa. (gentle music) Did you and your brother feed and water the animals? - Yes, sir. - I did all the work. - You did not. You just complained about it. - There is enough work to go around here without you arguing about who did what. Do you write every day? - I try to. - That's good. Writing is very important. Might've been you could have done something with it. Now... - Papa. - Yes. - Are we gonna be rich in California? - We're not going to California to get rich. God willing, we may create a better life for ourselves. - Our life was so terrible in New Hampshire. - When you work for someone else no matter how comfortable you are, you really have nothing, nothing of any value at any rate. Like the freedom to make your own choices. - Do you think we'll meet a mountain man? - Not likely. That's probably the only mountain man we'll see.. - Yeah, ain't none left no more. - Any! There aren't any anymore. Obviously wasting my time trying to teach you good grammar. (foreboding music) (owl hooting) (bear grunting) (tense music) (mules braying) - It's a bear! - Wake up. Come on boys! Go! Go! (bear roaring) (tense music continues) (bear roaring) (goods clattering) (bear roaring) (somber music) The axle's broken, it's snapped in two. - Well, can it be fixed? - Not before the snow comes. - This is more than bad luck John. Winters too close. - We'll have to build a shelter. I know we can salvage a lot of this. - It was too late in the season to go. Everyone told us that. - We will survive. God willing. - God is not willing. That ought to be clear by now. What about the children? Jacob gave up a chance to have a real education. John McKay, you know about building ships not about how to build a life out here. You don't know anything about this country? None of us do. Now we're going to have to pay the price for this dream of yours. Including this child I'm carrying. - Emma, there's plenty of time before- - No there isn't. There isn't. I didn't want to worry you. The baby's due in two months, not four. I tried to hide it! - It looks like the mules went off that way into the trees. I don't know about the goats. - We'll have to look for 'em. We have to worry about surviving first. (ominous music) (bison grunting) - Can't carry the meat. Hides ain't worth nothing no more. We're like that see? Past our time. Could be settlers here already. - Roots, berries. Anything we can use. Be careful. Don't go too far. Don't take any chances. Jacob. You're in charge. Whether you find the animals or not I want you back by sundown. - Yes, sir. - Watch out for your little brother. - Okay. Come on hurry up. (raccoon chittering) Where did you get that? - Found him. - Well put him down. We don't have time for that. - I'm hungry. Can I have some of these berries we found? - I told you that we have to save... (sighs) How many of you already had? - Not many? Hey look! (dramatic music) - Indians. - Let's get outta here. - No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe there's no one there. Maybe they all left. Could be something we could use in there. Come on. (foreboding music) - Look at all this stuff. - [Jacob] You know I think someone lives here. I think we better go. - Let's take some of this. - Are you crazy? Do you want to get scalped? - What do you suppose this is? - I dunno. Maybe something to catch fish. - We were just looking for food. (speaks Sioux) - It means Dark Wind. That's his name. He wants to know what you're doing in his lean-to. - [Jacob Voiceover] Most of my life, I yearned to see a real mountain man. And then there he was. It was like coming face to face with your dream. - Well speak up boy unless your deaf. What you doing with the man's possibles? - Uh. Our wagon was destroyed by a bear. We're looking for supplies. (speaking Sioux) - The old man's a little angry at you for messing with his possessions. Dark Wind here's a medicine man for the Sioux. They regard that bear you saw as a spirit of the land. They call him Walking Thunder and it ain't safe for you to be out on your own. Where's your kin? - It's not far. (expectant music) - Hour still till dark. They'll be here. - You should have told me about the baby. - Yeah, I suppose I should have. But you were intent on going? - I thought you wanted a new life too. - I've known for a long time that you weren't happy. You wanted something more. I didn't come because I wanted it I came because you wanted it. That's how it works when you love someone. - Papa! Indians! (horse whinnies) - Old bear done you in pretty good didn't he? Name is Murdoch. Found these two rummaging through the old man's digs, ain't too happy about it either. - See a real redskin Mama, just like Jacob wrote about in his book. I thought he was going to scalp us sure. - Don't suppose you folks got any vittles do you? - We have sufficient for our needs. - Well, that ain't exactly what I meant. See the old Indian and me, we could use a hot meal if you're so inclined. (medicine man speaks Sioux) - We're obliged for all your help. Won't you stay and take supper with us? Both of you. - Thank you kindly. (medicine man speaks Sioux) Walking Thunder existed from the beginning. The ancients knew that his strength and power were of the great spirit. His footsteps- - [Jacob Voiceover] His footsteps were like the rushing of great waters, his roar a thunderclap in the night sky. The bear Walking Thunder had dominion over the land. (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) Dark wind was a medicine man to the Sioux nation. He spoke for Walking Thunder. He sang the death song for his eldest son. A great bear had taken his son's life in sacrifice for the old man right here in these very mountains. (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) Dark Wind's son was known as the tribe's greatest hunter, but this day Dark Wind himself had found meat for the tribe. It was a she-bear. He didn't know he'd hunted and killed the mate of Walking Thunder himself. (bear roars) The son had thought his father was in danger, the very act of trying to save his father, was now to be an act of ultimate sacrifice. (bear roaring) His son was a swift runner but could never be faster than Walking Thunder. He said it was ordained by the great spirit. Dark Wind knew that the outcome of this deadly race was already decided. His son had been offered in the old man's place for his transgression. (son screaming) (bear roaring) (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) - Well, it's, it's late. You're welcome to stay the night with us and join us for breakfast in the morning. - Folks. I ain't wanting to stick my nose where it ain't wanted but I'll be heading up the Horse Creek Rendezvous. Now they ain't got an axle up there but they got a few things that you're gonna need to get through the winter. If you have a mind, I can do some trading for you. - We don't have much money. - It don't take much money. - We do need supplies John. - Let me go. I can watch out for us. I can take on the responsibility. You're always saying that. - Jacob, you're only 14. - 14 is old enough. - Please. - Well, um- - I can do it Papa. - Well, all right, Jacob will go with you if that's all right Mr. Murdoch? - [Jacob Voiceover] It was a dream come true. I was going to the last mountain man Rendezvous with a real mountain man. - Remember we need a cow, a milk cow. For the baby on the way it's important. That's all the money we have. You be careful. - [Jacob Voiceover] My parents were concerned for me though Papa hid it. I wasn't afraid. I knew I'd be all right with someone as great as Abner Murdoch. - Bring me something Jacob, don't forget. - Why would I bring you anything? I won't forget. [Jacob Voiceover] Abner told my parents that Dark Wind would stay and help them start to build a shelter. The medicine man was old and didn't move with the tribe to the winter hunting grounds anymore. - Good luck. (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) (adventurous music) - [Jacob Voiceover] Abner Murdoch knew more about living in the wilderness than anybody I'd ever known before. Certainly more than my father. He said, if you want to survive out here, you had to think like the animals think. (grouse clucking) (gunshot bangs) You missed. - Matter of perspective. Can't always believe what your eyes tell ya. - [Jacob Voiceover] There was no time for venison on the trail. And Abner said wild chucker was better anyway and easier to clean. (light music) - It looks about ready. Get that right off here. - [Jacob Voiceover] It was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted. Thank you. Abner told me about his life as a mountain man. How he'd come from Illinois at 14, my age. How he'd learned about surviving and living in the Rocky Mountains from the Indian nations, Yup, he'd just about done it all. He's one of the last of them. Men like Jim Bridger and John Colter. Ah Murdoch was the last real mountain man. (rousing music) He taught us about living in the open and what it meant to be part of the land. At the time I remember thinking how much my father really didn't know about life out here. It seemed to me, my father wasn't a real man. At least not the kind of man Abner was. Abner knew everything. And I wanted to be like him more than anything in the world. I wish my father knew as much as you did. - What makes you think he don't? - Well, I just mean that you know more about surviving than Papa ever will. He's just a boat builder from New Hampshire. - Well, I don't know how to build a boat. Do you? You think living life in the saddle makes you a man. It don't. Takes more guts sometimes to raise a family than it does to run off to the mountains. - Well, I just mean that he'll never be a Jim Bridger or anything. - Oh, you know Jim Bridger, did ya? - Yeah. Yeah I know everything about him. You know, how he found Yellowstone and started Fort Bridger and killed more Crow warriors than any man alive. - Where'd you hear all that? - Oh, I didn't hear it. I read it in this. - What's this. (scoffs) What's it say? - Oh, it says "Jim Bridger, King of the Mountains." - King? Jim Bridger! I hardly think so. He didn't do none of that. John Colter's the one nearly lost his hair running through Yellowstone. Liver-eater Johnston killed more Crows than Bridger ever even see'd. And the only reason they named a fort after him was 'cause he won a bet with a politician in a poker match. - I thought that- - Best get your facts straight boy. Before that mouth of yours gets you in some serious trouble. (foreboding music) - [Emma] Sweetheart. Will you fetch me some water? Hurry. - Thank you Emma. We should have all the foundation logs in today. (birds screeching) (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) - Yeah eni-la. What is it? There's something up there. I'm gonna go see. - Toby! - You stay here by the cabin. Toby! (ominous tense music) Toby back to your mother. (bear roaring) (Dark Wind sings in Sioux) (bear roaring) - The story was true. - Yeah. (sweeping music) (gunshots banging) (lively music) (people chatting) (people chatting) - How do you do friend? Good to see you again. Any new stock in the back room for me? (chuckles) - What do you want for it? I asked you how much. (harmonica whistles) - How much for what? - What do you mean what? You squinty-eyed runt. The horse. - He's not for sale. - Everything's for sale around here boy. And I want that horse. How much? - He's not mine. I'm just watching him. - Hah. You stole him huh? - No it's Mr. Murdoch's. I'm just watching him. - I guess Mr. Murdoch won't mind if I watch his horse for a while now, will he? - Yes I do. - I'm sorry. - No need to apologize boy, this is Rendezvous. You get all kinds here. You do have to be careful though. Got me some corn whiskey, do you want a swig? - I don't drink. - I didn't think so. Do you mind if I do? - No. - Ain't nothing better. Or closer anyway. Whoo. (gunshots banging) (lively music) Howdy friend. - Whatever you need, friend, it is all here. Dinna be afraid to ask. Good Pennsylvania steel that trap. - Very nice, but we need building supplies. 10 penny nails. Hammer. Saw. - Have it all I do and more. Best prices at the Rendezvous. Angus Campbell will not be undersold. - Do you have any hard candy? - Well sure. I'd be a sorry merchant without sweets now, wouldn't I? Here you are laddie. One free sample. - How much for the saw? - A dollar and a quarter. - Give me the bag of candy, I'll give you a dollar. - Sold. - So just head on over and pick out that milk cow your pa wants. - I don't know anything about cows. - Well, I sure don't. If you ask me, it ain't a cow your pa needs. What your pa needs is a rifle. - He's got his shotgun. - That ain't a rifle. Out here, you don't have a rifle. You ain't going to survive. Now these cap and ball pieces are all right but you lose a percussion cap. It ain't no better than a club. Now this flintlock works no matter what. You lose the flint, you just pick another one up off the ground. - You like them do you? - It's beautiful. - Colonel Colt's Navy revolver. You just load it up on Sunday. Shoot it the rest of the week. - That's the gospel my friends. 36 caliber, six shot Navy Colt. Finest sidearm ever made. Won't find a better belt gun on the frontier. - Nor a more expensive one. Took me more than a year of trapping to earn this one. - May I take a look at that? It's nice. Thank you. - I'd like to look at the Kentucky rifle please. - (chuckles) Done my friend. You know, quality when you see it. Now let's take a look at the workmanship. Go on touch it, rub your hands on it. Go ahead, it won't bite ya. - Got gold. I seen it. He's got a bag full of gold sovereigns. I seen 'em. (ominous music) - Lakota Sioux believe it's the great spirit. I seen it once and believe you me once was enough. Stood near 12 foot tall. Arms outspread alone measured more than the length of an Injun Cayuse pony. I ain't never seen the like of it fore nor since. Hellfire, the skin alone would fetch more than 100 gold dollars. - We've all heard of this ghost bear. No one has actually seen it. Must be the liquor talking Windy Bill. - Ain't no liquor talking Ansel Richter. What do you know anyway? I tell you I seen it myself with my own two eyes. Bigger than the mountain it was too. You hear it, you know why the Injuns call it Walking Thunder. - He's right. I've seen it too. (men exclaiming) - You've seen the bear. Have you seen it around here? - Now friends, you know how young uns are. He just wished he'd seen the bear. He wants to kill it with his pocket knife. (men laughing) - No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Let the boy speak. Maybe he has seen it. Maybe he did. Isn't that right, boy? - I... Well maybe I haven't seen it. - Maybe you just smelled him. - What exactly did you see? - I didn't see anything, sir. - Sir? (Ansel laughs) Been called a lot of things in my life. Never been called, sir. This isn't the army, you know? - Well maybe that's because "Sir" is a sign of respect. Something that scalpers ain't accustomed to. - Maybe you haven't heard that scalping's illegal. I've never done anything illegal in my life. - Now Ansel, that ain't exactly true. I seem to remember you and your amigos doing some time for some long distance target shooting on some Blackfeet. - You never change, do you Ab. You always thought you were better than the rest of us. Well you ain't bear squat to me. - Well now, bear squat is something I reckon you know a thing or two about 'cause the rest of what you're saying is just that. - Are you calling me a liar? - Don't need to. Don't need to call a skunk a skunk neither. Can already tell by the smell. (men laughing) (punch thuds) (tense music) - How does that feel squaw man? (men yelling) - You're right. He shouldn't have called you, sir. (gentle music) (rousing music) (pensive music) - Look at them tracks. - What is it? - Riders moving ahead of us. - What does that mean? - Means we ain't alone. Somebody decided to tag along. Could be after our goods. - Well you said they're ahead of us though. They're not following us. - That's an old buffalo hunters trick. Figure out where the herd is going. Then you wait for 'em. - Mr. Murdoch, can I ask you a question? - If you've a mind. - At the Rendezvous, what did they mean by squaw man? - I took me a Sioux woman to wife some years back. - You married an Indian woman? - Married's a white man's term, but it was something like that. Richter tried to offend me by saying it, but ain't no offense to be taken. - So where is she? - I left her and the young un, a long time ago. I weren't much good at taking care of them. They always had a roof over their head and plenty to eat. But it takes more than that. (wolves howling) - So you think those tracks are people following us? - Probably. - Well don't you think we should keep the fire low? I mean, not attract any attention. - Getting cold tonight, don't you want to stay warm? - I'd rather be safe. - Why don't you get some sleep. (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) (ominous music) - Mr. Murdoch! - They're gone. - You tricked me with the fire. - Well, I figured they'd move on us late. - You used me as bait. - You don't catch nothing without bait. - Yeah. Well... What if he'd shot first? - Well, he didn't. - [Jacob Voiceover] I was starting to understand about the laws of the wilderness. If you aren't the hunter, you're the prey. Abner Murdoch lived by those laws. (expectant music) - Down there by the creek. - What? - Let's get a closer look. (bear cubs mewling) Pelts will fetch a fair sum. - You're not going to shoot 'em are you? - They're not going to make it through the winter anyway. - Please don't. - Boy you're gonna have to learn. If you're gonna make it in the mountains, you gotta take what providence sends your way. (wood sawing) - Mama, it looks like take a real house. I gotta show Dark Wind. - Be finished in a week or so. As soon as I get those supplies they're bringing. - They'll be here soon. Winters in the air. You can smell it. - Mama, you think Jacob's been kilt by now. - Don't you talk like that Tobias McKay. Your brother's just fine and he's going to be here soon. And it's killed, not kilt. Mind your grammar. - I didn't mean nothing... Anything by it. Besides, he could've been scalped. - Oh, Horsefeathers! Now go on and do your chores. - All right. (thunder rumbling) - Howdy folks. Hope we didn't startle you. We've been traveling for awhile. Could do with some food if you have any to spare and get out of this weather. - You run into trouble? - Some. Blood Coat had this rifle backfire. Almost took his head off. - Yeah, he's lucky though. (chuckles) Just took off a little piece of his eye. - Well, we have a little stew. If you've a mind to partake. I wouldn't turn you away. - That'd be kind of you. We'd be obliged. - This wound is deep. - Yeah, took him by surprise. He never seen it coming. - You did this with your own rifle? - He doesn't talk. He can't. His vocal cords have been severed. - Yeah. Cut real good by a Blackfoot. A couple of years back. He never gonna talk again, ever. Ain't that right half-breed? Go ahead. Show her. - You Indian hunters? - Toby! - Buffalo boy, buffalo. We haven't had much luck either. We hear there's been a bear seen in this area. Have you run across it? - I'd say! He wrecked our wagon. - You didn't shoot him did you? - You're not after the bear are you? - Not exactly what we're after. But if we see him, we might take him. So are you folks planning on staying here? - Might be. - You'll need some more supplies I reckon. - Jacob and Abner went to get some more. Pop already paid for 'em. - Is that a fact? - There are more settlers coming. We just happen to be the first to arrive. An advance party. - That's funny. I didn't see any others. (thunder rumbling) - I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't smoke, it's not a habit we hold with. - God-fearing folk. Don't suppose you drink either. - It's not my place to tell you what to do. This is our home. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't indulge in front of the boy. - Didn't mean any disrespect. You know being Christian folk you better watch yourselves. The Indians don't care what God you believe in. They'll take your scalp as easy as the next. - I see you feel the same. - Injun ain't folk. Don't take scalp no more. Ain't no money in it. But if they're ever worth something again there's one to pay for the meal. (chuckles wickedly) - I think you better go. - We may come back this way again. You never know. See how you're doing. - Who's going to read that? - I never thought about it. I guess me when I'm older or maybe even my son or even his son. - Getting a family right quick there ain't ya? Never had much need for book learning myself. I do know how to write my name though. - Mama says everyone should read and write. - Well, I suspect she's right. Not much need for it out of here though. More important to learn how to read the signs. - Signs? - It's what I've been teaching you boy. This country will speak to you if you know how to listen. (owl hooting) - It's like you said, they've got gold. I could smell it. - Why don't we just go in there and kill them. Steal the gold. They don't know their backside from a box banjo no how. - There are people who know about them now. - I still say we should go in there and scalp 'em. Blame it on the Sioux. - No! We'll surprise them. So no one will be the wiser. (ominous music) (wolves howling) - Mama! Papa! Toby. - Oh, you're all right. - Yes, I'm fine. - We thought you were scalped. - Were scalped, and don't you talk like that. Thank you for bringing him back safe. - No problem. Your husband's making fine progress on your cabin. - Yeah. John went hunting. Where's the cow your father asked you to buy? - We needed this more. So I decided not to buy the cow. - Jacob, that was all the money we had. - Pop doesn't understand how to survive out here Mama. - It's probably my fault, Mrs. 'Spect I give the boy some ideas. - Well, I'm gonna let you be the one to tell him. - Some men come here last night. - Came here. - Jacob, did you bring me anything? - Now why would I bring you anything? Huh? Huh? Jump! Jump! - What those men want Ms. McKay? - Food. One of them was hurt. - How so? - He said his gun backfired on him. (ominous music) - Where'd your husband go off hunting to? - North. - Maybe I'll head on up there myself. Lend him a hand. - [Emma] Is something? - Oh no. There's no problem. - Well, I'm much obliged to you. - Fair welcome. Son, I want you to look out for your ma and your brother. You understand? Put up that rifle, keep a sharp eye out. Don't take no chances. - Is something wrong? - Could be. (suspenseful music) (turkey gobbling) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (tense music) (gunshot bangs) (dramatic music) - (indistinct) you want to keep your hair. (gunshots banging) (tense music) - Who is it? - I ain't sure. You stay here. I'm going to double back around. (John gasps) (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) - We are in your debt Mr. Murdoch. - No need for mister, just Murdoch will be fine. You folks is lucky you made it this far. These (indistinct) is rough territory. I'm headed out to Fort Bridger for the winter but I'll be glad to stay and help you finish your cabin 'fore I go. - You're a good Christian man, sir. - Well, I don't reckon I'm all that Christian Missus. but I do believe you did folks deserve a fair shot. - I know I'm not as wise out here as you, but we'll manage. You do think those Crow warriors will be back? - Weren't Crow that tried to kill you this morning. - But I thought- - You're thinking like a settler, this ain't New Hampshire. - Well, how did you know it wasn't the Crow? - The Sioux, the Cheyenne, the Arapahoe, they all have seams running down the inside of their moccasins, points turned in, so the prints look pigeon toed. The Crows' hide is tanned so smooth, there ain't no sign of a seam nowhere. - Well then it was another tribe. - No. The prints I saw this morning had a seam running right down the middle. Weren't from any of the nations. Them's from white men. - It's the men from the Rendezvous. - That's a good guess. - [Jacob Voiceover] Papa and Abner finished what was left in just a few days. For the first time I noticed a kind of new respect between them. Abner told us that the Crow war party was still around. They were on a hunt. According to Dark Wind, the spirit of the land was with us. The Crow and Sioux had been blood enemies since before the beginning of time. - Watch your head Jacob. - It works! (gunshot bangs) (Dark Wind singing in Sioux) - He's praying for your lives to be filled with plenty. - What's he doing now? - He's leaving a few things to bless your lodge with. Salt from the deer lick, so you'll have saver in your life. Jerk delt meat, so's you won't know hunger. And a dream catcher to hang above your door. - [Emma] What's a dream catcher? - The Sioux believe that dreams fill the lodge and then come true. The dream catcher catches the bad dreams while you sleep. So it's only good dreams come true. - [Jacob Voiceover] After a few days, Abner said, "If those men were coming back, they'd have been here by now." (bear growling) - Emma made you some food for the trail. It ain't much, but it's filling. - [Abner] Much obliged. - Do you have to go? - If I'm going to make it to Bridger before the snow fills that pass, I got to leave now. You take care to remember everything you learned. You hear? - Travel safely. - Lay in all the stores you can and listen to the medicine man. He knows more about these parts than anybody. Keep your scalp. - We'll be just fine. - He knows more than any of us Papa. (foreboding music) (cub growling) - I'm gonna get a new hat. - No time for this. (ominous music) No! No, no, no. No he's mine. (bear growls) (tense music) (Dark Wind speaks in Sioux) Damn! You're dead Indian. (gunshot bangs) Try howling with that medicine man. Get the bear! - Toby! You got chores to do. - Aw mom, do I have to? - I need some firewood. Please bring it to me. Now. (Toby muttering) (ominous music) - Mama! Dark Wind! - John! (somber music) The ball went right through his shoulder. He's lost a lot of blood. - They could be coming here, following him. - Who? - Whoever did this. - Are we gonna fight 'em Papa? - I hope we don't have to son, but we best be ready. - I wish Abner was here. He'd know what to do. (ominous music) - Is he dead yet? - Shh. No, he's not dead yet. I'm surprised he's not. - Well, does he still need his moccasins? - Toby McKay, please go out and help your father. (cans clattering) - Got my alarm done. (thunder rumbles) Well, at least that'll slow 'em down. - Not much. If Abner was here he- - He'd know what to do? I suppose he would. I don't know much about this sort of thing do I? - No. I mean, you know a lot of things. - Your mother was right. I took you away from everything you ever loved. - Papa. I'm sorry about the gun. I mean buying it instead of the cow. - Looks like you were right now, doesn't it? You're becoming a man. I forget about that sometimes. It's important you learn to make your own decisions. (light music) (horse whinnying) (bear growling) (suspenseful music) (cans clattering) - My alarm! - Shh! (door creaking) (dramatic music) (Jacob yelling) (men grunting) - Aargh! (Ansel laughs) - Come on! Come on hit me! Hit me! (laughs) Hit me! Hit me! (Ansel yells) (Weasel laughs wickedly) (pan clanging) (men grunting) You're tougher than I thought. Not tough enough! - Jacob! (Ansel yells) - All right move! Move! (pan clanging) Stop it! Or I'll kill him. I swear it. All right, where's the gold? Did you find it? - There isn't any gold. - You lie. I seen it. - He's not lying. There isn't any gold. - Where is it? (gun cocking) - She said there ain't no gold. Well looks like you whipped him some. - Behind you! (Abner grunts) (gentle music) - They wasn't so tough. - Weren't so tough. What your mother says. - Hey, why'd you come back? - I don't know, a friend persuaded me I guess. It's time we laid in stores for the winter. Which means you have some work to do with that rifle. - [Jacob Voiceover] The men had decided to head north and hunt. Papa didn't want to leave us alone But he knew that we needed the meat. And they had to lay in enough to last the winter. They left that very day. I was in charge my father said. That scared me some. Because none of us knew what happened to those men or where they went. (sweeping music) While the men were gone mother got closer and closer to her time. (somber music) The night it happened we were all alone. - Jacob. (panting) You get me some hot, boiling water. I need you to help me, sweetheart. (pants) - Mama, I don't know how. Maybe isn't time yet. (Emma grunting) - Jake, what are we going to do? - I don't know. [Jacob Voiceover] Toby and I tried to help as best we could. (Emma moaning) Then the old Indian Dark Wind came into the cabin and took charge. Toby and I were pretty happy to see him. That old man stayed right next to mother helping her through her ordeal. (Emma groaning) (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) - Drink it Mama. Dark Wind's gonna help you. (Emma panting) (Emma grunting) (Emma screaming) (baby crying) - [Jacob Voiceover] It was a baby girl, Toby and I had a sister. - Hello sweetheart. (Dark Wind speaks Sioux) (Emma speaks Sioux) - [Jacob Voiceover] I didn't know until many years later when I learned some of the language of the Sioux that the old man was praying for us that day. I still remember that prayer and the old man's voice as he chanted, "Walking Thunder, hear me. The voice I send is weak, but it's my heart that speaks. Give them the strength to walk the soft earth that they may face the wind and walk the good road to the day of quiet. Hear me, because the time is accomplished as you have shown." It was the most beautiful prayer I think I'd ever heard before or since. Dark Wind had seen the future. And the day my sister was born, he went to meet it. (dramatic music) - Papa the baby! (gentle music) (baby gurgling) (ominous music) (thunder rumbling) - It's been here today. - We ain't never gonna get that bear. - I'm not leaving here empty handed. - The venison's down there in the ground larder. (foreboding music) We've got company. - It's Richter! - Yeah. (dramatic suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) - Shots! - It'll take more than that to kill him. You stay here. - Get him! (gunshot bangs) - We hit that grizz. I know it. (bear moaning) Where is he? I know I hit him. I know'd it! I know'd it! - He can't have gone that far. (Dark Wind singing in Sioux) - What is that? I don't like the look of this Richter. - It's an old medicine man. I'll take care of him once and for all. - What if he really is bad medicine? - Shut up! Then he's my bad medicine. Sing your death song old man. That's good. (dramatic tense music) (gunshot banging) (horse neighing) - Get him! Go on. Get him! (horse neighing) (men grunting) (men grunting) - I think you've just run out of magic old man. - Hold it. Drop the gun. - You don't have it in you boy. (gunshot bangs) - Let me at him. (tense music continues) (men grunting) - Well go get him! (Weasel grunting) - Where's Jacob? - Your friend isn't gonna help you now sonny. I'm taking your hair. (bear growling) (bear roaring) (Richter screaming) (gentle music) - Jacob! - Papa. - Came up out of nowhere. - I'm glad he did. - He came to help us. - I just had a feeling son. - You done good. Both of ya. - [Jacob Voiceover] I couldn't believe that my father had come after us. I never looked at him quite the same ever again. He was more of a man than I'd thought. To this day I can still see Dark Wind's face as he followed the great bear. Abner said weasel and Blood Coat had run off when my father came back. Abner told us he was going to make sure they didn't come back, ever. Abner said he'd come back in the spring to check on us said he'd take me along when he came back and then he gave me his Navy Colt revolver that I had admired so much. Said a man needed a good sidearm out here. I knew I'd never be a mountain man like him. And I told him so. He told me I'd do better to be a man like my father anyway. That a real man was someone who took care of the folks who counted on him. As I watched him ride off I knew he was right. I never saw him again. - Finished? All of it? - How'd you know I'd read it? - I figured you wouldn't. But your father did. Seems he's right. - For me? - What'd you think? Yes for you. Now, write in it. - I will. - [Jacob Voiceover] I realized I was more like my father than I'd ever thought, because what's really important isn't something you own and isn't something you hold in your hand. It's more than that, it's staying with the land, working hard and raising your family. Those ideals don't make a man weak. They make you a man. There were a lot of stories we heard about the old man and the bear in later years. The mountain men used to say that the bear called Walking Thunder had died that day. And the old medicine man buried him in a secret place. And on that very spot was born the most pure spring water ever found in the Rocky Mountains. Medicine men of all nations years later insisted that Dark Wind healed the great bear with his powerful medicine and the two roam the mountains together. And finally, at the end of their lives, they were taken to the great spirit's bosom without ever tasting death. The Sioux have a saying, what is life? It's the flash of the firefly in the night, it's the breath of the buffalo in the winter time. It's the little shadow which runs across the tall grass and loses itself. Life is not long or short, it just is. But I like to think of Walking Thunder lived for many more years, longer than any bear has ever survived. To me he is the spirit of this land and like the land, like our family, that spirit goes on forever. (bear roaring)
