Hi, honey. Mom, why is there strange man in my yard trimming my flowers? That's Rick. I met him at pickleball. He's a widower. He loves doing yard work and your yard needs work, so I just said have at it. Hi, Grandma. - Hey kiddo. - Good morning. Grab some breakfast and no lollygagging. We all need to be on time today. Good morning, Emma. Get some breakfast. It's too early to eat. And remember I told you I like to skip breakfast. And I told you that breakfast kick starts your metabolism, helps you bring more calories throughout the day, and fuels your brain and body. I Googled benefits of eating breakfast and printed these articles for you. Can't be serious. But I am seriously, very serious breakfast. Fine. I'll eat, but I'll do it in protest. Noted. Okay, so we have Gary's basketball game after school today. And I think that's it, we're not as busy as usual. Is dad coming to my game? He says he is. Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it. - Emma. - What? We all know Dad's not very reliable. He's always so busy. Okay, kids whenever you're ready. Let's go. Grandma, are you okay? I'm fine. I just thought I'd take a little breakfast out to Rick. He's been working pretty hard. (door clicks) Hey. (Rick chuckles) How's it going out here? [Rick] It's a nice yard you got. Maybe you need some energy. Oh, thanks very much. Is it just me or is Grandma acting a little weird? She's acting really weird. (upbeat music) (group chattering) And please wish your dad a very happy 75th from all of us. (Maggie giggles) (door clicks) Good morning, Devon. Did you see the new episode? [Maggie] I watched it this morning. That triple tiered cake was an inspiration. Our cakes are just as good. Yeah, but we're still more of a best kept secret kinda place. Any response on your application? Nothing other than it was received. Ugh, sudden mood change. Your was-been just walked in. I have to go outta town. Seriously, no, hello, how are you? What beautiful weather we're all having today. This again, come on. You're fine, the weather's great, and I have to go outta town for work. Can't somebody else go? You've been traveling so much lately. I know, but there's a senior financial analyst job opening at the end of the year. And I have to take on all extra trip and work right now. I want that promotion. And what about Gary's game? I'll have to miss it. I can't be two places at the same time and I have to be in Brussels so. Fine. I will cover for you again, but you need to text the kids and tell them, and then you need to spend time with them when you come back. Yeah, yeah. I know the drill. Wow. This place looks good. And when you said you wanted to open a bakery, I thought it was a terrible idea, but now, I'm glad we did. You need to remind him that this is your bakery not his. (Maggie giggles) (birds chirping) Oh. [Both] Ow. Oh. Ow. Michael. - Maggie. - Hi. Wow. Hi. I feel like I haven't seen you in a while. Yeah, you haven't. Anyone ever tell you got a hard head? Yes, I've heard that before. Well, they were right. (phone ringing) (Maggie chuckles) Oh, hang on. Oh, well from your hard head to a hardheaded client, I gotta take this. - Okay. - Sorry. I'll, I'll see you inside. See you inside. Hey, save me a seat. - Of course. - Okay. Yes, yes. (group chattering) Who are you looking for? What? No, one. - No one or Zach? I don't know what's more embarrassing you knowing about Zach or being at a freshman basketball game. Being here totally not cool. Supporting your brother totally cool. Do you think he wanted to go to all your dance performances, lacrosse games, piano recitals? Message received. Go, Bull Dogs! Thank you. That was good. - Okay. Your dad coming today? He said he was. Yours? - Yeah, he never misses a game. [Michael] Hey, Maggie. Hey, you made it. (timer buzzes) (group clapping) Well, you know, we're only down by eight, that's actually not do bad for us. I just really want them to win a game. They work so hard and a win would really bolster their confidence. Mom, are you serious? They're terrible. Emma. What? They are. Just keeping it real. I'm sorry, you just have to ignore her. She's a teenager. (Maggie chuckles) [Coach] Go, go, go! (clock buzzes) (group clapping) Good game, guys. - Good game, boys. - Good game. See the scoreboard? We got crushed. Well, it's not about how much you win or lose by. It's about, help me out here. It's about, I think the other team was cheating. (chuckles) I thought you were gonna use some PR skills. Yeah, I didn't have anything there. You, you played, you played with heart. I'm just keeping it real. Dad, can we take care Gary to Pizza Alley with us? Absolutely. You guys wanna come to Pizza Alley? We would love to. (gentle music) (laughs) I forgot about this place. We used to come here all the time. I'm not sure why we stopped. Oh, well, if your reason is anything like mine, it's because you got schooled at ski ball by some random 12-year-old girl, and you didn't wanna show your face around here anymore. (Maggie laughs) Will looks like he's doing a lot better. Yeah. Yeah, he is. You know, it gets a little easier every passing year. And I couldn't help but notice you're not wearing your wedding ring. Uh, no, no, I'm not. I, I kept telling him we had to find a way to move on and it turned out that I wasn't. And well, he called me on it, so no ring. Sometimes moving on from anything is easier said than done. Tell me about it. I think Nicole would be very proud of you. Both of you. Thank you. - Thanks. - There it is. Thank you. All right. - Come on over. - Pizza time! - Pizza! Pizza. - Pizza party. (Maggie laughs) Who gets the jalapeno? I want it. It's all yours, kiddo. - Yes. - Get in there. (knuckles tapping) Dad missed my game again. I know, honey. And he wanted me to tell you how sorry he is. He got called away on business to Belgium. I mean, he could have told me himself. It only takes like three seconds to send a text. I know. And he's- - Mom, stop. You don't have to make excuses for him. (bell ringing) (group chattering) New lab and new lab partners today. I know. I hope I get someone smart. And you hope you get Zach. Huh? Jeff kinda cute, kinda smart, I could do worse. I did do worse. I got the new kid. Hi, Zach. Yo, Em. (gentle music) It's too bad we're not lab partners. I know that would've been cool. But maybe we could hang out sometime, you know, do something. Yeah, sure. Cool. I'll text you. (insects chirping) Ooh, that looks nice. (phone ringing) (phone beeps) It's Friday night, why are we conversating? Hey, so I was brainstorming some cake ideas and I wanted your input. Do you remember that episode of "Make It, Bake It, Cake It" where they used the, it like a- Maggie, you know, my rule. I don't talk bakery stuff on my night off. I am covering the early shift tomorrow and you've got the night off, go out, do something fun. Right, it's Friday night. You're at the bike park. I'm assuming you're having a wheelie good time. (laughs) See what I? Devon, where'd you go? (phone thuds) Okay. Do something fun. (upbeat music) (laptop thuds) ♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ (Maggie exhales) ♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ Yes! ♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ (door clicks) Maggie, can we talk for a minute? Uh, sure, yeah, no, it's kind of a busy night, but it's, uh how, how was Brussels? Brief. Good. And, um, where are our kids? Oh, Lisa took them to grab milkshakes. I wanted to talk to you alone. Well, she is obviously the world's most perfect girlfriend. Fiance. I'm sorry. What? Well, that's what I wanted to tell you. Lisa and I are getting married. You're getting married. Yes. We're planning a small backyard ceremony at the end of next month. And of course we'd like you and the kids to be there. And do the kids know about this? Not yet. Wanted to tell you first. All right. Now you've told me. Yeah. Okay. (door bangs) Some people complain about how noisy it is at a pickleball game. Have they never been to a jai alai match? I've always wanted to play jai alai. - Me too. - What? We should go. - Let's do that. And then one thing led to another and we started spending time together and then more time. And the next thing I knew, we were a couple. - Wow. - Oh, honey, Rick is a great catch. And if I didn't make a move somebody else would've. All of the widows at the tennis club had their eye on him. So when you told me you were out with the girls? I was with Rick. - Book club? - Rick. Pickleball? Oh no, pickleball was actually pickleball with Rick. Why did you not tell me about him? Well, I just guess I was waiting for the right time and, and part of me was afraid that I don't know, I just didn't know how you'd react. Mom, I'm okay with it. I mean, at least I think I am. You did, you caught me a little off guard, but Dad's been gone for a while and he would want you to be happy. I want you to be happy. I mean, seeing you with someone else that's gonna take me a little time to get used to, but I support you. Rick seems like a really nice guy. He is. And I'm happy. This is just great. So my mom has a boyfriend, my daughter has a crush, and my ex-husband is getting married. David's getting married? Oh yes, he is at the end of the month. And yay, we're all invited. That's why I came by. I just wanted to tell you the happy news. (Grandma sighs) What you don't seem so surprised? No, I'm not. David has proven time and time again that he's capable of moving on. It seems like everyone's capable of moving on, except for me. Mags, nobody's holding you back. There's more to life than just work and kids. You're independent and you don't need a relationship, but there's nothing wrong with wanting one or looking for one. You know what? You're right. I haven't given dating much of a thought, but maybe I should give it a try. I could even bring a date to David's wedding. Yes. (Maggie laughs) I'll do whatever I can to help. Well, I will need that because I have not been on a date in 20 years. Oh, maybe just don't wanna say that out loud. (Maggie laughs) (birds chirping) Hey, Mom. (Maggie sighs) (door clicks) Good morning. Good morning, good morning. I brought coffee. Thank you. Why are you here so early on a Saturday? Because I'm excited. I set you up with a blind date, who's Celia's nephew. You did what? He's single. He recently moved to town. You're single. You're looking to date. So you'll be meeting him for dinner tonight. I'm really sorry, but I, I cannot go. Of course you can. You wanna start dating again and dating's all about who you know and who they know. So I have a single daughter, Celia has a single nephew, one plus one equals? A blind date. Exactly. (Grandma laughing) (traffic humming) (group chattering) Oh, thank you. Hi. - Welcome. I'm here to see George. Yes, the gentleman in the black shirt. Right this way. George. Hi, I'm Maggie. It's really nice to meet you. I hope you weren't waiting too long. No, you're right on time. I got here early. I was hungry. Mm, thank you. Really hungry. (playful music) Can I get you something to drink while you look over the menu? That gentleman has already ordered his dinner. Oh sure, I will have a club soda with line. And how is the pasta pesto? It's one of my favorites. I will have that. - Okay. - Thank you so much. Of course. (bread crunching) So I hear you just moved here. From where? Oh, I'm sorry. What was the question? You just moved here. Yeah, yeah, that's right. (bread crunching) (gentle playful music) You would pardon my reach. Now do either of you care for coffee or dessert tonight? - No. - Yes. I'll have a coffee and a tiramisu, please. Can you excuse me for a minute? I'll be right back. - Leave. - What? This is a blind date, right? You can tell. Everyone in the restaurant can tell. Oh. This may be your only chance. Get out before he comes back. I can do that? Sure, we just need a believable excuse. Do you have kids? - I do. Perfect. I'll tell him there was an emergency with one of your kids, a high fever. You apologize, but you had to go. Come on. Okay. Oh, thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. (flag rustling) (window whirring) (gentle music) Maggie. Maggie. (knuckles tapping) Hi. - Hi. - You scared me. Sorry. I pulled up right here and I was waving and yelling at you, and you were just locked on over here. Everything all right? It's kind of embarrassing. A dating app. - Yes. - Oh. Well that's, it's not embarrassing. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm actually on that one. - You're on this? - Yeah. I mean, I'm not very active. I'm Cool Dad MT. (Maggie and Michael Laughing) Oh, I see. This is probably explains why I'm not very active. (Maggie laughs) I'm a little surprised, I, I, you know, you had said that you weren't interested in dating after your divorce. Yeah, I know, but things change, and I am looking at this hoping there's some kind of dating advice because besides a disastrous blind date, I haven't been on a date in 20 years. Oh, well, I, I probably wouldn't announce that. (chuckles) I've been told that before. (laughs) Well, I mean, if you're anything like me, you're probably just wildly out of practice. Maybe, maybe there's a way that we could help each other. Let's, let's go on date. Like a, like a, a pretend, like a practice date. You know, we can observe each other in date mode and, and give helpful suggestions and constructive criticism. It's actually a really good idea. There you go. Well, how about tonight? I'll pick you up at seven. Wow, uh, you're, you're really outta practice. This is normally where you would respond to my comment and, and give an answer one way or the other. Yes, yes. Let's go on a pretend date. Okay. I'll see you at seven. It's a date. - It, pretend. - Pretend date. Pretend date. I'll see you then. Huh? (exhales) What in the 1986 is that? My mom set me up. I had to go. If you're serious about dating, you need to get on some dating apps. It's not that easy. I looked, there's so many. There was one for farmers. There's one for bacon lovers. One even promise me, I'd find my salad soulmate. Does anyone need a salad soulmate? So not all dating apps are food centric. It's important that you know that. And although you didn't really ask, I am going to help you. Not necessarily because I want to, but because I obviously have to. Before I get on one of these apps for practice, I am going on a pretend date. A what now? A pretend date. We're going out as friends to practice. Sorry, but there is no such thing as a pretend date. (phone ringing) Unknown number. Don't answer it unless you're actually concerned about your car's extended warranty. Hello, this is Maggie Delaney. What? Yes, of course I remember. We can absolutely make that happen. Thank you so much. (phone dings) (gentle upbeat music) That was "Make It, Bake It, Cake It". - What? - We're gonna be on it. No way. Oh my goodness! This other bakery dropped out. They loved our application, and we're filming here in two weeks. (Maggie cheering) Oh, congratulations. That's amazing. This is gonna be huge for the bakery. Thank you. This could really help us out with the second location. Well, we're gonna have to have a viewing party when the episode airs. Mom, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's a lot of work to be done before then. Hey, Mom. Can I go to Shake, Battle, and Bowl tonight? With Lily? Sure. No. Zach just texted, asked if I wanted to meet him there. You and Zach like a date? Sort of, I guess. I can go right? As long as you're home by 11:00. So this is kind of weird, since I have a date with Rick tonight, we all have dates. That is weird too weird. Too weird. Let's still talk about it, (Maggie and Grandma laughing) (fast tempo upbeat music) (knuckles tapping) (door clicks) Michael. Hi. - Hi. Uh, you look great. Look nice. So do you. Uh, ready to go? I hope so. (laughs) Me too. Look at us, I'm on time, we look great. You look great. And we're, we're making small talk. We're a good start. You're already better at dating than I thought, then you thought, right? Should we? Yeah, just if, just if only to stop me from speaking. (both laughing) Was Will excited about video game night? I know Gary was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was. And he's already looking forward to that basketball tournament at the end of the year. Couldn't stop talking about it. I know, they were both telling me about that after school program. Wait, wait, wait, okay, okay, hold on, hold on. This is supposed to be a date. - Yes. - Right? We should be getting to know each other, not talking about our kids. - That's true. - As fantastic as they are. That's very good dating advice. We should, we should both take that. I brushed up. (Maggie laughing) Oh right, I know this one. Nice. Yes. Very good work. Can I ask where we're going? Well, I did a little research and by research, of course, I mean, I interrogated your poor son, and he told me, "That you really liked the food you had on your trip to New Orleans." So I am taking you to a cool little cafe called Cafe New Orleans. Jumbalaya, po-boys, crawfish. Are you attempting to do a New Orleans accent right now? Yes, ma'am, I think I am. Can I give you some dating advice? - Mm-hmm. - I would just leave out all the accents. - Ah. - Just not do them. Okay. Noted. Arms in the bus. No accents. (upbeat music) (Maggie laughing) 'Cause you never know. That's true. Wow. - Oh, wow. Thank you. That is a lot of crawfish. That's a lot of crawfish. (Maggie laughing) I'm only realizing now when we ordered the house special, I probably should have asked some questions 'cause I'm, this is you, you've never had crawfish. I have not, but I trusted you to order. And now here we are. What a mistake. Gosh, no, I'm so happy we came here. This place is really cool. And I appreciate your effort. Okay. I've also heard that the best way to peel a crawfish is to have someone do it for you. That's you. - That is one way. No, I got a very subtle gesturing. Uh, that is one way, but actually I'm gonna show you the real way. You get 'em like this, okay? Twist. Oh. - You dig. No, get in there. And Bob's your uncle, there's the meat. That's what we're looking for that guy right there. Tastes better than it looks. Oh, it was really good. It's good. - Mm-hmm. - All right. Only 250 more to go. Get in there.

(Grandma chuckles) I'd love to hear more about your family. Have you and Maggie always been close? We have, and even more so over the last few years. I lost Bob soon after she divorced. We were both dealing with, you know, our own kind of grief. The kids were young, she needed help, so I moved here to be close by. I'm glad you had someone. Yeah. After I lost Pat, we'd been married so long I forgot how to be alone. Ah. It's nice to have met someone whose company I enjoy so much. (Grandma laughs) (group chattering) (upbeat music) - Thank you. - Thank you. So good. Ah, beignets. Beignets. - Thank you- - Thank you. Very much. So if you don't mind me asking why the sudden interest in dating? Couple of things I guess. I just felt like everyone was moving forward, moving on. My daughter started dating. My mom is in a relationship. And when I found out that David was getting married, I don't know, it just made me feel like I wasn't moving on. Hmm. Were you upset by the, the wedding announcement? I mean, did you, did you feel like you two might get back? - Oh, no. - Oh. No, no, never. But it forced me into some kind of self evaluation. This may seem petty or unimportant, but I would like to have a date at this wedding. I feel like I feel better or at least I, I think I would. I get it. You want somebody by your side for comfort and support during what is probably gonna be pretty uncomfortable. Very. Thank you for reminding me. Or at least to make sure you don't leave the wedding in squad car. (laughs) Yes, I need a friend. Oh, I cannot believe I didn't tell you. Do you know that show "Make It, Bake It, Cake It"? - I do. - I'm gonna be on it. Or Sweet Sensations is gonna be on it. Congratulations, that's amazing. Thank you. Why are we having dessert here? You have a whole bakery. I do. Would you like to go? I, I would like that. ♪ See the sun rise and it's breaking my heart ♪ You have to be home at 11:00, right? Pretty lame I have a curfew home huh?

That's cool. ♪ I need to feel the sun light ♪ ♪ Like the earth never changed their mind ♪ I should get going. The guys are already there. Okay. ♪ Let it burn through the darkest times ♪ (gentle music) Okay, that chocolate cake looks incredible. Is that bacon on top? It is. And we add some crumbles inside the cake as well. Emma actually inspired it, and then she named it The Wiki Wiki Chocolate Cakey. (laughs) Okay. We're gonna have a piece. Oh yes. So Sweet Sensations how did it all start? You don't know the story. I don't. Tell me. Here you go. Wow, okay. That's a piece of cake. So when Emma was born, I knew I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom, and I was very fortunate that that was an option. And for fun, I started making elaborate cakes. I made- - Mmm. You like it? I think it might be the best thing I've ever had in my life. Carry on. Well, people started asking me to make cakes for them. So I started out very small, just baking out of the kitchen in the house. And, and then when the kids got older, I had more time on my hands, so I started researching what goes into opening a bakery, put together a proposal, and with David's help secured a loan, and I opened this place. Impressive a self-made woman. And we're hoping to open a second location. I'm sure being on "Make It, Bake It, Cake It" will help with that. We hope so. A lot of bakeries, they double, triple in business after being featured. I bet. But I didn't really think about all that went into it. I, I just, I don't know if I'm gonna be that interesting. Come on, you got an incredible backstory, your bakery is beautiful, and your desserts are, uh, hmm, they're amazing. I wish I had your confidence. - Let me help you. - What do you mean? Come on. I'm a, I'm a PR guy. I am in public relations, this is what I do. I help people all the time get ready for presentations, pitch meetings and interviews. I, I can help. You would do that? You have time? Absolutely. I would love to. Well then I accept. Well then I accept your acceptance. (Maggie laughs) Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna finish my cake. I'm glad you love it. [Michael] Mm-hmm. Oh, I had so much fun tonight. I forgot we were on a pretend date. Yeah, so did I. Now that we have arrived at your door signaling the end of the evening, I can say with certainty, Maggie Delaney, you definitely know how to date. So do you. You know what else I decided? You are my barometer. I don't think I know what that means. You're my indicator. Just knowing you, I just feel like there are good guys out there, and if I keep looking, I'm gonna find one. So basically you're saying I'm a good guy. No, I didn't actually say. Didn't say it, but you implied it. I guess a little bit maybe, partially. Yeah. [Maggie] Well this was fun. Yeah. Well I guess I should. [Michael] Yeah. - Goodnight. - Yes. Goodnight. (door clicks) (door bangs) (sighs) Barometer. Well, I could do worse. Thank you. So after a great pretend date, I think I'm ready for the real thing. So a single guy picked up a single girl, took her to dinner, spent three and a half hours with her, and paid the check. I'm sorry, it was a date. It wasn't a date. He is the one who specifically labeled it as pretend. And then when I told him we were gonna be on "Make It, Bake It, Cake It" he offered to help me prep. So he is not interested, but a busy single father is just magically gonna have time to help you. Yeah, right. I told you we're friends. Our kids are friends. But it was really fun. And I'm starting to feel more confident. You're gonna help me with online dating, right? Yes. Here, take my phone, download all the apps I have, and start working on your profile. Wait, I have to be on more than one? (slow tempo gentle music) [Teacher] Wait for it. (air hissing) - Whoa! - Oh my God. (group laughing) - That's so cool. - Em. Hello? You watching this? Mm-hmm. You sure? 'Cause you're not really paying attention. Sorry. It's just, I met up with Zach at Shake, Battle, and Bowl on Saturday and he's kinda ignoring me. Oh, I didn't know you were with Zach. Yeah, we just started hanging out. That's great. (bell ringing) Let's see what you've got. Cool Mom MD, really? What? I like it. People may think you're a doctor. And when they come to me for free medical advice, they're gonna quickly realize that I'm not. Not bad, but it could be a little better. Remember your profile is your first impression. People decide within a matter of seconds, whether or not to pursue you. In seconds? That's quick and harsh. Maybe, but that's how dating gets done. And you can chat with potential matches sitting on your couch in your pajamas. I do like my pajamas. Here, I made a few changes. Okay. Intelligent, funny, successful, single mom, looking for someone to share everyday adventures with. That sounds great. Couldn't that be read as a little braggy or intimidating? Maggie, that is nothing to hide. And at this stage you earned the right to brag a little. If you say so. Okay, one, two, three, post! Okay, that was a little overly dramatic, but I'm proud of you. And remember you have to be proactive. Mr. Wonderful isn't just gonna come knocking. (knuckles tapping) [Maggie] Michael. - Hi. - Hi. Hey. - Hi. Hi. Hi. - Hi. You must be Devon. I've heard so much about you. - Nice to meet you. - Michael. - Hey. - Devon, this is Michael. Okay. Excuse me. Um, I just came by to, to grab this. Will loves your cheesecake and it's his half birthday, so we're celebrating. I know it sounds kind of weird, but you know, we're celebrate the little things kind of people. Well, please wish him a very happy birthday from me. (Maggie giggles) I will do that. So Saturday night that was, that was fun. It was really fun. (playful music) She's definitely watching. - She's watching. - Yes. Uh, yeah, I was wondering if, I don't know if you wanted a little more practice? Actually, thanks to you, I think I'm finally ready for the real thing. I just signed up for that dating app. - Oh. - That's me. That is definitely you. - My profile. - Cool Mom MD. Okay, people might think that you're- A doctor. Yeah, I just figured that out. Okay, cake doctor. A cake doctor. I'm a doctor cakes. (Maggie and Michael laughing) All right, well, I was also gonna ask if you wanted to set up a practice session for the, for the show. You could come by the office and talk it through. Oh, that sounds great. And we're less than two weeks away and I definitely don't feel ready. Great. Not that you're not ready, right? (laughs) Yes. [Michael] We want you to feel ready. I hope you want me to feel ready. We'll schedule a session. I'll text you and we'll, we'll make a plan. Text me. Okay. (Maggie laughs) Uh, I'm gonna go. I'll, I'll text you and we'll set up a plan. I already said that. Okay. Happy birthday, Will. - It was nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Yeah, take care. Like I said, no such thing as a pretend date. (birds chirping) Okay, but why is it called a beaker? That name doesn't make any sense. Well, probably 'cause it has a beak for pouring. No, still doesn't make sense. (John chuckles) Um, next up we have biomolecules oxidation reduction in chemical kinetics. Okay, but before we do that, I heard about two atoms that were walking down the street. One says, "Uh-oh, I think I lost an electron." The other says, "You sure?" And the first says, "Yeah, I'm positive." (laughs) (gentle music) (both laughing) I actually like chemistry jokes periodically. (both laughing) Can we stop here? I've to dinner with my dad tonight. Oh, yeah, totally cool. I'll take off. So you think you're gonna go to homecoming? Yeah, totally. Just waiting for Zach to ask me to make it, you know, official. Cool, that's awesome. I'll see you in class. (door clicks) So now what? I just wait for hits, or flirts, or winks. Wait for them or send them. Up to you. Oh, I just got a wink from a guy named Steve. What do I do? Look at his profile. If it's interesting wink back. If not ignore it. While I love tutoring you in dating apps I actually called for another reason. What do you think about girls night? Just you and me on Friday. Ooh, that sounds great. I'm in. Hey, the kids just got home. Uh, let's talk details tomorrow. Can do. I'm out. Hey, how'd it go? Uh, Dad made zero effort. Just ordered a pizza. And he only wanted to see us to say that he and Lisa are getting married. How do you feel about that news? I don't know. They've been together a while, so I'm not really that surprised. Gary seemed kind of bummed though. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why did you and dad get married? I mean, you're both so different. 'Cause we were young and in love and we wanted to spend our lives together. But you didn't, you got divorced. Well, we tried to make it work for a really long time. We both loved you, and Gary, and the family we created, but we had grown too far apart on too many things. Okay, so like in the beginning, how did you know that you liked him? Well, it's not gonna be the same for everyone. It's gonna be a combination of things. Common interests, the ability to talk to one another, similar sense of humor. Your dad and I had all of that when we were starting out. But if you are asking me about you, this may sound old fashioned, but I think you want a gentleman. Someone who treats you well, but also knows you are strong, you are smart, you are capable. He lets you be you. You shouldn't have to shrink in order to make him feel big. And if someone isn't all that? Well, sometimes two people aren't meant to be together and that is okay. Are we talking about Zach? Yeah. After we met up that time, I thought he was gonna ask me to homecoming, but he hasn't really said much to me until today when he finally texted. All he said was yo. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't really know how to interpret that. Me either. Just go out there, have fun. Find your way. Just let the relationship and dating stuff, it'll work itself out. Is it Zach? (Emma laughs) No. It's my lab partner John. He sent a science meme. [Maggie] Oh, that's funny. Such a dork. That's a beaker with a beak. Yeah. (laughs) John's funny. (phone ringing) (door clicks) Who is ready for girls night? Maggie is! Oh, you're referring to yourself in the third person now. It's new, random and a little weird. Here, I grabbed your mail. Thank you. What? (playful music) David's wedding invitation. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. He found his soulmate good for him. Maybe tonight I'll find mine. I thought it would be fun, and the interactive style makes it easy to meet people. And note the men to women ratio. Awesome note, I might be the oldest person here. (laughs) Hi, I'm Isaac. We need a couple more for our foosball game, do you guys wanna join? Definitely. I'm Devon, this is Maggie. Well, very nice to meet you guys. Devon, you wanna be my partner? - Absolutely. - Look at that. - Oh perfect. - Maggie, Alex. Alex. - Maggie. - Nice to meet you. - Maggie, Devon, here we go. [Maggie] Wow. - Oh, yeah! - Yes! Good job, we crushed them. Since we lost we'll get the next round, yeah? Hey, you wanna play some pool? Sure, that sounds fun. Let's go. (giggles) I can't remember the last time I played pool. Here, let me show you. You should tell Alex that Maggie owns her own business, is a great boss, and she knows how to yodel. Wow, yodel? Uh, that is cool You know what else is cool? Owning her own business. Yeah, you're right, that is actually pretty cool. How about a little wager? Let's say 20 bucks. I barely remember how to play. Why don't you tell me something about yourself? Shoot first, talk later, I'll even let you pick the game. Eight ball, English billiards, snooker, straight pool? I don't know what any of those things are. Do you think she's gonna win? - Yes, definitely. - No, she isn't. (both laughing) (rock music) (group chattering) Here you are. - Nah. - Ah. Very good game. Good game. - I'll see you soon. - Okay. I think I could get good at this. - Yeah. - Uh-huh. Isaac and Alex invited us to hit up another bar after this. Are you up for it? Even I know what that means. Isaac wants to go out with you. I know he's definitely into me. (laughs) But Alex seems nice too. He is. He's really good at pool. We just don't have that much in common. And he's a little young for me. Come on 40 is the new 30. And 10:00 PM is my new midnight. Let's call it a night. We got you out of the house. We had some fun and I finally got to spend time with you outside at work. Thank you for helping me. (door clicks) (light clicks) (phone beeps) Wink. (phone ringing) Michael. Hi, is everything okay? Hi, yeah. Sorry. I, I, I, I meant to text you and I accidentally called. I, I hope I didn't wake you up. No, not at all. What's up? My afternoon is wide open tomorrow. And I was wondering if, if you wanted to try and slip in that practice session? Sure, I, I would love to. Good. Okay, we can do it at my office. How's noon? Yeah, yep, noon sounds good. Everything all right? You sound a little distracted. Uh, it's just been a weird past few hours. I got David's invitation and I was just snuckered at eightball. And now I'm home, and I'm hungry, and suddenly craving those spring rolls from China Dragon. Oh, China Dragon. And they have those, the cream filled wontons. Those are so good. Well, I've never tried 'em, now I suddenly want to. Uh, well, if, if you wanna forget that you're hungry, maybe I could distract you. Are you able to FaceTime from your laptop? I can. Good, okay. Well then get your laptop, get comfy, and call me back. Okay. Hi, okay, so this is called camera rolls scavenger hunt. We have to run it for a client of mine for his new hire orientation. So this will actually be really helping me out. I am happy to help you in any way I can. So how do we play? Well, I choose a category like flowers or whatever, and then using only the photos on your phone, we have to find pictures of said category. That sounds really fun. Let's give it a try. All right, we'll start with something easy, dogs on skateboards. (Maggie laughing) I'm kidding. Let's do meals. Let's start with meals. I'm sure you have a ton of pictures of food. I don't think I do, but I will hunt for one. Oh, okay, I got one, I got one. What? That was so fast. Hold on. Hunting, hunting. Oh, I found one too. Got it. Uh, so this is, I was teaching Will how to grill and this is a steak dinner that we made. Oh, that looks delicious. This is a chicken pop pie that I am unusually proud of. Ooh, that looks really good. Let's do a sunrise or sunset. Oh, that one is easy. I got it. - What? What's taking you so long? Do you hate the sun? I'm a sunset guy more than a sunrise guy. Okay, I got it. Look at that. Here's mine. Oh, that's gorgeous. Where is that? This is Turks and Caicos. - Where's yours? - This was a hike we took a few months ago. Oh, I'm so sorry, it wasn't an island. (Michael and Maggie laughing) I'm totally kidding. (laughs) Can I pick the next one? Fire away. Um, how about favorite family photo? Hmm. (gentle melancholic music) Michael, I'm so sorry. I should not have said favorite family photo. No, Maggie, no. Its okay. It's good photo, isn't it? It's a great picture. It really captures Nicole's bubbly personality. Yeah, it does. You know, our anniversary was a few weeks ago, 17 years. You think it's weird that I still make her favorite dinner to celebrate? It's not weird at all. It's a great way to keep her memory alive for both you and for will. Yeah. (doorbell ringing) Who would that be? It's really late. I'm gonna let you go. Uh, I'll see you tomorrow. And Maggie, bon appetit. [Maggie] Goodnight, Michael. (door clicks) As we wrap it up today, remember if you are getting married in or around Seattle Dream Day Cake is the go-to for your wedding cake. I'm Priya Parker. - I'm just about finished the press packet for Jacob and Roberts. They wanna meet here Tuesday at nine. Does that work for you? - Perfect. - Thanks Jill. - Will do. Thank you. Hi. Michael. - Maggie. - Hi. - Hi. - I cannot believe you sent me food last night. Oh, well you were hungry. And I wanted you to try the wonton. They were really good. You were right. This office space is fantastic. How long have you been here? Couple years. Still a bit of a work in progress, but we're getting by. Do you always work weekends? It depends. A lot of people here have kids, so we let them make their own schedule. I love that. I have been watching "Make It, Bake It, Cake It"? (giggles) You have? I have. Gonna be helping you out, I should know what I'm helping you with. That is incredibly thoughtful. Thank you. Have you decided what you want to focus on or highlight, things you want to avoid? Well, they do a lot of wedding cakes and kid cakes, so I think we should stay away from that. I'm thinking, you're thinking the right thing to think. Um, we wanna make your episode stand out. You know, Sweet Sensations is about so much more. This is why I hired the best PR guy in town. I got the best one. In this part of town. (Maggie laughs) Come with me, I wanna show you something. (pins rattling) (upbeat music) You're up, new kid. Why do you guys still call me new kid? I moved here in seventh grade. There's a ton of kids, newer than me. Just kind of suits you. Yeah, it does. ♪ If I can do it ♪ Everybody's having fun, right? My party is fun, isn't it? Lily, it's great. Except Zach's being weird. Isn't really talking to me. Maybe because you're beating him. I can't help it up in a better bowler than he is. I'm just gonna throw gutter balls just so we can win. (pins rattling) I'm tired of bowling. Anyone want to hit the arcade? ♪ Isn't every night and day ♪ ♪ Keep on working ♪ Why do you like him? What? It's just, he isn't really that nice to you. He's the most popular kid in school. So what? He can still be nice to you. None of your business, new kid. I have taken the liberty (Maggie gasps) of setting up a little replica of the bakery. Wow. - Yeah. - This looks incredible. Thank you. So we'll use this table as the counter. Obviously this is a hat that I've had custom made for myself. That's a cake. That's a, that's a cake. And then we can figure out where and how you wanna stand, so you feel most comfortable 'cause the more comfortable you feel going in, the more comfortable you will appear on camera. (gentle upbeat music) Michael, I cannot believe you did all this. This is amazing. I'm already starting to feel less nervous. That's 50% of the battle right there. Okay, so I think the best place for you to stand is probably here. Where it says Maggie. Where it says Maggie. Now I have prepared some questions for you that I think are, no peeking, thank you, are the types of questions that I think Priya will ask. She's gonna want to know how Sweet Sensations started. Obviously you already have that answer. Any ideas on how to make it more interesting? No, I, I like the answer. I think it's interesting enough. I think the thing to remember with all the questions and answers is to find a way to distinguish yourself and the bakery in a way that makes you stand out. Distinguish, stand out. (Maggie laughing) All right, oh, this is a good one. Okay, do you plan to make any changes to your bakery? Oh, um, ah, that's a hard one because I'm sure there are lots of things we could change. But what I really would like to focus on is that we are hoping to open a second location. Okay, well you could just say something like you're really happy with the success of Sweet Sensations and you're excited to replicate it in? - A second location. - A second location. I love it. That's hopeful, that's honest, that's positive. Great things. Ooh, okay, I like this one. Is there anything you bake that isn't currently featured at the bakery? I do make an amazing sweet and salty chocolate chip cookie. I wanna hear more. So I was fooling around in my kitchen one night and I added this ingredient that, you know what? I'm actually not gonna tell you. It's not gonna do it justice. I'm just gonna make it for you one day. I'm gonna hold you to that. You know, you still have a week left until you shoot, and I don't think you realize what a natural you are. Thank you. (Maggie exhales) - All right. - All right. Let's go through some camera basics. I will stand on my mark. ♪ But I keep totally soft ♪ ♪ I shouldn't spend my life ♪ ♪ Thinking of you ♪ Hey, Em, about earlier, I'm really sorry. You should hang out with whoever you want and it's- Yo. I got next on ping pong table, need a partner, you in? Yeah, sure. Sorry. I, I was talking to new kid. I really wanna beat Luke and Nico. Uh, actually Emma's better than me. You'll probably do better playing with her. That's okay, you guys play. I'm gonna catch up with the birthday girl. ♪ With you ♪ How, how are you feeling? Are you hungry? You wanna get something to eat? Oh, I would love to, but we're actually doing a family night tonight. We haven't had that much quality time. Yeah, no, no, you don't have to explain. Kids come first as they should. Plus you have to be up super early to take the boys fishing. Yeah, I don't know how Will got me to agree to that. (Maggie laughs) I'll see you in the morning. See you in the morning. Hey, thank you again. (phone ringing) (insects chirping) [Gary] Why does fishing have to be so early? Well, I don't know. It's probably 'cause the early fish catches the worm. I don't get it. You were trying to be funny, weren't you? I was, yes. (laughs) Good morning. Good morning, morning. Oh wow, not everyone can pull off that look. Oh, is it the baggy robe or the fancy scrunchy? I think it's a toss up. (Maggie laughs) You ready? - Yeah. All right, you guys catch 'em I'll cook him. [Michael] Deal. Hope you have a real good time. (laughs) It too early for that joke? It's never too early for that joke. (Maggie laughs) - Bye, Mom. - Bye. Bye bye. All right, kiddo. (group chattering) So there's Steve who hasn't replied to my wink. And besides that I got nothing. Follow my lead. Be proactive and ask Steve to meet up. Okay. And done. Good. Now we need to focus. The shoot is in five days and we have to choose a dessert and theme. Right, so I think we should go with a fall cake. It'll make Sweet Sensations stand out, it's gonna look good on camera, blow Priya away, and make sure everyone remembers us. [Devon] Okay. (door clicks) Hey guys. Oh nice. We caught 'em now you have to cook 'em. Oh no, no, no, not so close. Oh, you're not afraid of a few little fishies are you? How you gonna cook 'em if you don't wanna touch 'em? Ah! - I didn't really think this part through. I can help. Are you gonna let me off the hook? Come on, no. It's all you, no, you can't, no. (Maggie laughing) What do you call a fish with no legs? (Maggie laughing) A fish. Do you guys know how you get a fish to talk to you? You drop it a line. (Michael and Maggie laughing) Dad, why are you laughing? It's not really that funny. Oh, I'm just being polite. Hey, what's the best way to catch a fish? You have somebody throwing at ya. (Maggie laughing) Being polite, Mom? No, I thought that was funny. [Michael] It was funny. Hi, I'm sorry, we're late. What did we miss? Mom was telling fish jokes. Oh, I'm really sorry we missed that. Here you go, are you gonna eat the whole fish? (Emma groans) Did we give her Sam? Oh, I think we gave her Jimmy. Oh, this was Jimmy. [Maggie and Michael] You got Jimmy? Yeah, go easy on Jimmy. (water splashing) Dinner was fun, fish jokes and all. It really was. Thank you again for taking Gary. Oh. Sure he wishes it was his dad taking him fishing or anywhere for that matter. Is David's still working and traveling around the clock? Oh, yes, that's David. There's not a work trip or assignment he can say no to. I think he thinks the kids just wanna spend less time with him as they get older, but I'm the opposite I just wanna spend as much time with them as they'll let me. As you should. I'm the same way. You know it's like they say you have kids and suddenly time just disappears and it turns out they're right. They're growing up. It's true. (phone beeps) Steve replied. I have a date. Wow. We're going wine tasting. Okay. Wine night. (birds chirping) Look, I know I've been a little busy and spread thin lately, but I wanted to take some time to talk to both of you. As you know, your father is getting remarried and Lisa will be your new stepmother. Yeah, so? Well, that's kind of a big deal. So I just wanted to make sure you're both okay with it. It's not really gonna change anything. We only see dad like once a week and that's only if he has time. And we'll probably see him less after he is married. He's gonna have new wife, maybe a new family. He'll be focused more on them. Hey, you guys don't know that. Gary's right. Dad knows when he supposed to see us, just chooses not to. (birds chirping) I have to admit I was a little intimidated by your profile. You being a doctor and all. Oh, I'm not. I'm not actually a doctor. Those are my initials. MD, Maggie Delaney. I own a bakery down on Front Street. You run your own business. I do. That's a little more intimidating. Still I suppose when you saw my occupation software engineer, you must have thought how incredibly boring. No, no, actually I just thought dork. (laughs) (dramatic playful music) (birds chirping) You know I was kidding, right? My kids would be so embarrassed that I used the word dork. (chuckles) Oh right kids. You are a single mother. - Mm-hmm. - That must be, um, how many kids do you have exactly? I have two. I have a daughter who's 16 and a son who's 14. How about you any kids? Ha, Maggie, no, but it's okay that you have them. I know that when I date women my own age, they're bound to have children already or want them immediately for some reason. It's been challenging, but it's something I've learned to accept. Now for the real reason we are here, I was very happy that you took the initiative and called to meet up. I've been wanting to come here with another wine connoisseur for quite some time. Oh, I would not call myself a connoisseur. I'm more of a, I'll have a glass if there's nothing else to drink kind of gal. (laughs) Let's try this one. Okay. It uses a hand grafted hybrid grape. Very difficult to grow. And I'm told we can expect notes of pomegranates. Is that correct? Pomegranate. What are you looking for? Clarity. Texture. Glycerin. That's very good. Mm-hmm. (wine swishing) (playful music) (Steve spits) Right at the end there. Very nice. The end was what I felt as well. Thank you. Are you free Friday night? I have tickets to a private concert. A renowned string quartet is in town for one night only, and I would very much like to take you. Sure. That sounds fun. Moving on. [Devon] So how was the date? I would rate it as, okay. He didn't really ask me any questions about myself or laugh at any of my jokes. It was the first date. He is probably just nervous. Besides he has to see you again, so he is at least a little interested. Mags, you're not committed to Steve, just to a second date. That reminds me. I actually need to call Michael, schedule some more episode prep. Interesting, I say date you think of Michael. I was expecting more episode prep. I wasn't expecting all of this. What exactly is this? Well to thank you for helping me, I was going to make you my sweet and salty chocolate chip cookies. And I thought, why make them for him when I can just teach him how to make them? Oh, so this is more of a teach man to fish than give a man a fish thing. Oh, I see what you're trying to do there. And although you baited me, I'm not gonna make any fish jokes. Are you gonna make a baking joke? You butter believe I am. All right, so next we add in the chocolate chips. - Okay. - I'll let you do it- - Thank you. - Since I'm teaching you. All right, now, I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm guessing that the chips represent the sweet secret. Ding, ding, ding, you are correct. All right, all of them? All of them, yes. Okay. And then you just. All right, all right, all right. - Okay. - I can do it. - I'll let you do it. - I can do it. Now that I have almost successfully folded in the chips, what's next? Next we add the salty, the secret ingredient that makes these cookies so special. (thunder crashing) Rain check? While chocolate is the most popular cake in the world, guess what the most popular cake in the United States is? I don't know, vanilla. Oh, I wish. It's pineapple upside down cake. Oh, what? - Yeah, right? - No, you're kidding me. I like all cake except for pineapple upside down cake. I can't stand it. And people that put pineapple on their pizza don't even- - Oh, no. - Get me started. I'm right there with you. (laughs) (gentle music) How was, how was your, your wine tasting date? It was okay. I'm not really that into wine, but since I wrote on my profile that I like to try new things, I figured I should. [Both] Try new things. (Maggie laughs) Did you work in any of your corny jokes? Oh, I did, I did. And you know, while I was there, I just really took the time to stop and smell the rose. (Maggie laughs) Oh, that's, that's good. - Thank you. - That's some good work right there. How about you? Have you been on that app lately? Did you find anyone to wink at? Oh no, I, no, I'm not, I'm not moving too quickly on that. I know that Nicole would want me to be happy, but I'm, I'm not ready to take that leap. It's understandable. You need to take your time, go at your own pace, and anyone that you're with needs to understand that. You get me, you really get me. And when I do wink at somebody, I'm gonna make sure that it's somebody who really interests me. (electricity clicks) (insects chirping) Well, even though I never actually got to try your top secret sweet and salty cookies, that was fun. It was. You're still coming to the shoot, right? Absolutely. I wouldn't miss it. So I guess I will see you at the boys' game. Yeah, I hope so. I, I had a meeting come up last minute and I'm desperately trying to get out of it. Uh, I would like that. (man vocalizing) Well, I guess I should go, so goodnight. (man vocalizing) (car door clicks) (car door bangs) This was just delivered for you. Oh, oh, oh, I know what this is. These are Maggie's secret recipes sweet and salty chocolate chip cookies. Go ahead. Thank you. Mmm. Wow. Yep. This is so good. It's brilliant. Oh. Here's the market research for Morris and Son. [Michael] Thank you. I knew you liked her. I'm, I, I, I'm, I'm- Just do it, Michael. She's obviously interested. Trust me, women don't share their secret cookie recipe with just anyone. She's interested. Ba, ba, ba, ba. Huh. (playful music) (phone dings) (upbeat music) (phone dings) (gentle upbeat music) Michael just sent me a wink. What do you think that means? Means I'm right, and there is no such thing as I pretend date. (whisk clanging) (group cheering) Go Bull Dogs! (ball bouncing) (group booing) Oh wow, I should film this. Yes. - Go, go, go! - Come on, go, go, go, go! - Hey go. - Shoot. (timer buzzes) (group cheering) Oh, yes! Good job! Bull Dogs! Wow, that was amazing! Hope you filmed it. I got it all on video. Your dad is gonna be so proud. Dad isn't here. I know honey, something must have come up. Something always comes up. Stop making excuses for him. [Devon] Maggie, we shoot tomorrow, you have to decide. Well, the pumpkin spice tiramisu is definitely a potential. Nothing screams screams fall louder than pumpkin spice. And the spiced apple cake is really popular. It looks so pretty with its glaze. Is, and while I love the idea of the pear skillet cake, I don't think it's gonna look good on camera unless they only photograph it from above. That is a very good point. So my gut says we should go with the pecan pie cake. It's unique, it's very fall. It's gonna look great on camera. I got this. David, I am so glad you could stop by. Why so many cakes? I guess the kids didn't tell you. We're gonna be on "Make It, Bake It, Cake It". We film here tomorrow. Wow. Is that why you're summoned me? So you can brag about that. No, and I'm not bragging. Also, you are gonna have to pay for that. You can't be serious. Oh, I am. I'm very serious. (David scoffs) It's not enough that I paid for the bakery when it was made? Okay, David, we need to get a few things straight. First of all, you didn't pay for this bakery. You helped me secure loan, but that is it. I did everything else. When our marriage ended so did your interest in this bakery, You wanted nothing to do with it, you got your wish. It's mine. It's not yours. It's not ours. Fine, it's your bakery. You finished? No, I'm not. From now on I'm gonna start making decisions that are best for me and for our kids. Not what's best for you. You've let them down for the last time. So this is a schedule for the next month. It outlines all of your responsibilities to the kids. I'm not available to change your switch days with you, so don't bother asking me. You need to start making your work schedule around your schedule with Emma and Gary, not the other way around. They love you. They're your kids, they just, they wanna spend time with you. You always were the better parent. I'll try and do better. I promise. Thank you. (gentle upbeat music) I am so proud of you. Wow, that gave me a burst of confidence. I'm gonna start trusting my gut. We are going with a pecan pie cake. Yes. Oh, that felt really good. Your bakery is perfect. I mean, perfect size, perfect layout. Even the exterior, it really, you know, blends with the surrounding environment. I really love it. Thank you so much. I was actually part of the design team. I really wanted our bakery to have a welcoming feel. Good to know. I'll be sure to bring that up in our conversation. Do you mind if I take just one second? Of course, do what you need to do. Um, we'll be ready to roll in a few minutes. Thank you. Michael, hi. I'm so happy, you're here. Wouldn't miss it for the world. Like I did the best basketball game ever. Apparently three point buzzer beater come on. Wait, did Will tell you? Take a look. (gentle upbeat music) (timer buzzes) (group cheering) Oh! That's my boy. That's my boy. It is. Maggie, thank you. That's so great. Send that to me, please. [Maggie] Of course. Oh, this is exciting. How are you? Are you feeling good? Are you ready? - I'm good. I'm a little nervous still, but I feel ready. Good. Well, just remember all the things we talked about and be yourself. It'll be great. You got this. Thank you. I'm Priya Parker. Welcome to another episode of "Make It, Bake It, Cake It". It I'm standing with Maggie Delaney owner of Sweet Sensations, and we are coming to you from her beautiful bakery in downtown Franklin. So for the cake, I swap out granulated sugar with brown sugar, and I add a generous amount of crème de cacao. I imagine that compliments the pecan pie filling too. That's the idea? - Ooh. - Yes. Mm, ooh, that is good. So for the frosting, we also use brown sugar, which gives it a richer flavor. - And a nice coloring. - Mm-hmm. I am excited to see how this all comes together. All right, all that's left is my favorite part trying the finished cake. (Maggie giggles) Mm, mmm. Wow. That is amazing. (Maggie laughs) You know, the filling tastes just like pecan pie. It is pure heaven. And the brown sugar cake and the frosting, perfectly compliment each other. You know, I thought that with the filling and the frosting, it was gonna be too sweet, but they are actually very, very good together. This pecan pie cake is worth adding to your holiday lineup, whether it is a fall event, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or anywhere in between, this one's a winner. I'm Priya Parker, goodbye from Sweet Sensations. And I'll see you next time on "Make It, Bake It, Cake It". (Priya chuckles) (group cheering) All right, that's a wrap guys. Maggie, Devon, seriously this cake was amazing and I am so glad you didn't do another wedding cake or a princess cake. I mean, how many more of those episodes do we really need? Right. Really nice meeting you, Maggie. Well done. Oh, it was a pleasure meeting you, and thank you so much for having us on your show. Of course. You know, when you open that second location, let me know. We would love to do another episode with you guys. Our viewers really love follow-up episodes. - Absolutely. - Thanks- - We would love that. - Priya. [Priya] Right, okay, bye, guys. Bye. (Maggie and Devon cheering) Best day ever. - You're shaking. - I know. It's over, we did it, we did it. Thank you. Oh, that was so fun to watch. And you were perfect. I don't know if I'm perfect, but I do feel good about it. That was really fun. Thank you for your help. - I- - Would do anything for you. Is that why you winked at me? I was wondering if you were ever gonna acknowledge that. I winked at you because I wanted you to know that I was here in case you wanted to go on another date. Practice. Pretend, yeah. Or otherwise. (bell ringing) Maybe I won't go. Just homecoming. What? No, you have to go. Zach might not be perfect, but he's a good homecoming date. It's a few weeks away, he hasn't asked anyone. Yes, of course, I'll go. (gentle brooding music) (door bangs) Hey, Em. How was school? Awful. Zach asked Susie Crawford to homecoming in front of everyone. Oh, honey. I should have just asked him. Like maybe if I didn't wait, we'd be going together. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Zach asked Susie, I'm not going, the end. You want me to cancel my plans? We could have a mother-daughter night, order pizza, eat ice cream, watch some cheesy reality TV. No, it's fine. You should go. Plus shock, Dad texted, and double shock wants to meet for dinner. Even suggested China Dragon, Gary's favorite spot. That's great. Maybe some of their famous wontons will just help you forget about Zach. Who? That's the spirit. There you go. (fast tempo violin music) Wow, they are very good. Oh, reviewed as one of the best quartets in the country, you know? You know, I have heard that a string player's motto is it's better to be sharp than out of time. (laughs) What did I tell it wrong? Oh, I have no idea. I just don't think this is the proper setting for jokes. Oh. And as I'm sure you already know, puns are the lowest form of humor. (playful music) (phone ringing) Um, I, I should probably check this. It, it could be one of my kids. Right, kids. I'll meet you back at our seats. Me, I'm sorry. (gentle music) Is everything all right? Your kids seem to be distracting you quite a bit. My daughter thought this boy was gonna ask her to homecoming, but then he ended up asking someone else so. Sounds unimportant. Just another teenage girl with a broken heart. I'm sure there's nothing you or anyone could possibly do about it. (fast tempo violin music) I'm really looking forward to the second half. I hear it's even longer. (gentle music) It was a little uncomfortable. I've never broken up with someone before. Really? Do it once a month. Don't tell Isaac I said that. I think I might actually like him. See, when you say things like that, it makes me think I'm never gonna understand dating. And truthfully, this experiment has just made me feel like I'm really happy where I am. I love my life. There's nothing wrong with wanting a relationship, but it's amazing when you realize you don't need one. Exactly. And if somebody finds me and it's meant to be, then it's meant to be. And if it's meant to be with Michael, don't wait too long to wink back at him. (Maggie sighs) (gentle brooding music) I waited too long. He's no longer available. Okay, boys, extra cupcakes for you. (knuckles tapping) (door clicks) Hi. I'm so excited for you. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Your mother is so proud and thank you for including me. Of course. I'm so glad you can make it. Enjoy. (door clicks) Devon and Isaac. - We're here. You can start the party. - Come on in. - We brought champagne. So when the episode is a success we can celebrate. And we brought sunflowers, so in the unlikely event the episode is a flop, they'll cheer you up. I did research sunflowers are the happiest flower. Thank you. That's very thoughtful. (laughs) All kidding aside, you okay? I think so. I'm a little nervous about watching the show and also seeing Michael. He said he was coming today, but I haven't heard from him. Since the rejected wink. Oh, thank you for so succinctly verbalizing that. He'll show up. He's a good guy. Wink or nod, he's not gonna stop supporting you. (doorbell ringing) Told you. - I'll get it. It's probably my dad. Okay, do you guys need anything? (door clicks) Emma, the new kid's here to see you. (door bangs) Uh, I'm so sorry, I should have texted Emma to see if it was okay to stop by. No, it's okay. We can talk in here. He's cute. I'm sorry, I interrupted the party, but I've been wanting to talk to you. About chemistry. Do you wanna change lab partners? No. I love being a lab partner. Em, I know he wanted to go to homecoming with Zach and I know I'm not as popular as he is, but I was hoping you would go with me. I can make a sign and come back or get flowers or get down on one knee, whatever you want. I just, I, I really like you and wanna take you. And I thought- - Yes. Really? Yes, I'll go with you. (both laughing) So- - Oh, okay, everybody go. I just started reading a book on helium. Ah. I can't put it down. (both laughing) Turning into my mother. Oh, here you go, you two. Sit here. - Oh, thanks. But I really should get going. - Oh no, no. - No. This is the premiere Maggie's episode. No, no, you have to sit right here. Besides if you're taking my granddaughter to homecoming, I'm gonna need to get to know you. Grandma. Uh, okay, I guess I could stay. Okay. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Come on, sit down. Oh gosh, I'm a little too nervous to sit down. So I'm just gonna walk back and forth right around here. (Maggie laughs) (door clicks) Hi guys. What's up? Quiet, it's starting. I'm Priya Parker. Welcome to another episode of "Make It, Bake It, Cake It". It I'm standing with Maggie Delaney owner of Sweet Sensations. And we're coming to you from her beautiful bakery in downtown Franklin. This pecan pie cake is worth adding to your holiday plans. Whether a fall event, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or anywhere in between, this one's a winner. I'm Priya Parker, goodbye from Sweet Sensations. And I'll see you next time on "Make It, Bake It, Cake It". (group cheering) (group clapping) It was okay, right? It was great. It was the best episode I've ever seen. Let's watch it again. It really, really was. - I'll get some champagne. - Really was good. Hey. So well done. Thank you. Um, hey, can I, can I steal you for a sec? Of course you wanna talk back? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. (Maggie laughs) (gentle music) Uh, I got, I got you something. - Is that- - It is. - A gift? - For you. Yeah, I, I- - It's for me. I saw it and I thought of you. (Maggie laughs) (paper rustling) [Maggie] What is it? [Michael] Open it up. Oh, look. It's a barometer. Um, I'm giving it to you because I don't wanna be your barometer anymore. I don't wanna be the guy that indicates that there are good guys. Michael, I meant, I meant that as a compliment. I know, I know. I, I don't want to be your barometer, uh, because I want to, I wanna be the guy that you date. I wanna be the guy that laughs at your corny jokes, (laughs) and insists that you laugh at my even worse jokes. And the guy that helps you prep for baking shows and, and you know, the guy who believe it or not wants to accompany you to your ex-husband's wedding. Uh, that's the guy that I wanna be. Uh, you know, you'd really be helping me out of a potentially very humiliating situation if you'd say something. Anything, anything at all? Just say just anything at all. Hey, look, it's pointing at you. This thing works. Oh, that's so corny. (gentle upbeat music) You'll really go to David's wedding with me? I wouldn't miss it for the world. Wait till you see me dance. (both laughing) (gentle music) I'm so glad you're here with me. Yeah, me too. Now that we're dating I'm a little nervous that you might desert me. (Maggie laughing) Oh, don't you worry. I will not go baking your heart. Oh, that's good because I think you're flantastic.
