LUPIN THE THIRD It's a weight detection system. Floor's off limits. See ya, boys. Out of my way! You're joking. Gotcha. I think I'll take this. I'll make you mine one of these days. Fujiko. We've been waiting for an hour. Give me a break. Why does Interpol need Hong Kong police for a Singapore robbery? Yeah. Who is this guy? An ass. Shut up and pass them down. I'm Inspector Koichi Zenigata of Interpol. Let's not waste time. Shut the curtains. Last night, four thieves broke into a private art gallery in Singapore. And ransacked it for a medal. They're part of a Hong Kong organization we're investigating. Each of them with superstar criminal track records. Especially him. Lupin the Third. His methods are flashy but his skills are peerless. For some reason, he's been quiet this past year. In fact, all of them have been missing from action recently. The question is "why?" I believe the answer lies with this man. Thomas Dawson. A respected British tycoon. But that's not all he is. He secretly runs a professional thieving ring called "The Works." We've been after him for 17 years with nothing to show for it. Those four are members of The Works. A confab of young and old thieves takes place tonight. At last, they're on the move. You look bored. Jealous? I came alone...haven't decided who I'll leave with. Waiting for them to announce a winner? Women always like winners. Hey Lupin! Who detonates a bomb in an art gallery? You nearly killed us. It'd take a lot more than that to kill you guys. I used a new explosive called Malibu. Fingertip accuracy. I guess we were stupid to be tiptoeing around. Speak for yourself. Nothing happenin'. What's this? Who is it? Roll out! Okay, go! Go, go! Michael! Uncle...Uncle! What the hell? Son-of-a-bitch! Wait! Dammit! Michael took that medal off of me. Why'd you have it? I wonder. Uh-huh. But I didn't follow him. What'll you do now? Say Jigen? Care to join forces? I think we'd get along. Going after him? And the necklace. Find one, and you find the other. Could be fun. I'm in. Let's get Pierre back, too. There can't be many brokers willing to touch Cleopatra's necklace. Comb through them and you'll likely find a clue to Michael. I'll poke around. Listen Lupin. Leave her out. She can't be trusted. We're thieves. We steal back what Michael stole from us. With interest. "Lupin was here" No sign of Michael Lee whatsoever. What did I tell you? Leave "her" out. She can't be trusted. Remember? The info she brings us is nothing but danger. She's sent us all the way to Thailand on another wild goose chase. Stop your complaining. At least we've scored a lot of loot along the way. Drink up. Wow, Fujiko wants to meet me. I'll be right back. Listen to me. In our line of work, women... are an encumbrance. You're wrong. Fujiko is not your run-of-the-mill woman. She can't be trusted. Sooner or later, she'll betray you. That's okay. It's one of her most endearing qualities. Later. Can't you ever use the front door? Surprise is important in a relationship. Arno? Hands up! Oh me, oh my. Surprise is important in a relationship. Who are you? Koichi Zenigata, Interpol. I'm so sorry, Lupin. This scary inspector... threatened to arrest me if I didn't bring you here. Given your chivalrous nature, I knew you'd happily take my place. See ya. He's yours. Uh-huh. That's foul play, Fujiko. I brought that wine hoping to share it with Fujiko. I don't taste any difference. You wouldn't. You drink cheap liquor. I'm sorry about Dawson. I'd hoped to take him alive. I found this in his mansion. The Ark is the world's most secure vault. For politicians, celebrities and you know... the one percent. Why show it to me then? Do you know its owner? Pramuk, right? Chairman of Navarone Security. Dubbed the "Security King." And by night, an underworld kingpin. Smuggler of arms, drugs and people. His diverse portfolio forms the backbone of his wealth. Why don't you arrest him, then? Pramuk has very powerful friends who keep him at arm's length from us. He's untouchable. You're after this guy. After the Dawson incident, he managed to disappear. Then 3 weeks ago, he resurfaced as Georgio Zhang. A well-heeled investor with a fortune. This Georgio Zhang... a.k.a Michael Lee contacted Pramuk through a financial fixer named Ajit. To arrange a Buy/Sell transaction. Know what that is? I'm a thief. Not a businessman. Pramuk has what Michael wants. And vice versa. He's looking to buy or sell a treasure at a posted price. Why tell me all this? So you'll steal it when the transaction happens. What? Nick the treasure from these guys and let it fall into my hands. It'll give me the proof to nail them. Right? You're nuts. Are you arresting me or scouting me? I'll make it worthwhile. Do this and I'll wipe your record clean. Could be a lot worse, you know. Well... I'll think it over. Cut that out...you. Hold it! Ow, ow, ow! You little...! Lupin the Third, you will do my bidding. Fujiko, you've got some nerve! Yum! Hey, who gave you permission? Mmm, fabulous. The stuffy guy can cook. Say what? Women. Well? What're we here for? Michael has surfaced. Momrachiao Pramuk. Not just Michael but Pramuk, too? Suddenly, we're outmatched. That's what makes it fun. I've no interest in jewels or women that are easily won. Something bothering you? Now that Michael's back? I'd be lying if I said there wasn't. Lupin may cut you some slack, but I don't trust you. I wouldn't be surprised if this were all a trap set by the two of you. A little heavy on the nutmeg. Huh? Thanks to Michael, Jiro and Dawson are dead. I want him to pay. Sooner or later... I'll be settling a score or two with him. I was fond of Dawson. And I've never been comfortable with loose ends. But the world's most valuable necklace is out there. For us thieves, it's the ultimate prize. Give me a break. We know what you want. Is it that obvious? Wouldn't Fujiko, the ultimate woman, look stunning wearing Cleopatra's legendary necklace? If that were to happen, I'd be utterly and completely yours, Lupin. You are blind, Lupin. This is difficult and dangerous. No, what's difficult is solving this puzzle, Pierre. In here is all the data that Dawson ever collected on Pramuk. We'll need a detailed analysis. Pramuk and The Ark. And everything about his dealings with Michael. Leave it to me. And Inspector Zenigata? You're not letting him call the shots. Who, Gramps? No way. He'd never overlook my sins, anyway. He's the type that's a pain in the ass if you cross him. My ass will be in pain either way. I'll deal with it later. And me? What should I do? Does it matter? You'll do as you please as always, Fujiko. Go wild. Let's go, Jigen. Where? Japan. If we're fighting tough guys... I'll need powerful weapons. How offensive he is. See that attitude? Well whatever. Later junior. No way! Amazing. Wow! Wait, too much. Sir! I meant this. Sorry. Kirikaeshi. Commence! Zenigata. Narong. Still remember how to move? How far are we going? Yoo hoo. Is this some old school ascetic training? What good would swinging a sword do? Gun beats sword! Say that again? See that? This is why we need him. Long time, Goemon. I asked you to say that again. I said the sword's no match for a gun. Try me. What? Shoot me. With pleasure. Come on, boys. Let's play nice. Don't worry. I won't kill him. You're quick. But your right shoulder drops before firing. 10 centimeters to the right, and you would've been hit. Why'd you come? For work. I need your help. No thanks. Don't be that way. Let's eat. Your favorite dumplings. Caramelized. I'm expensive. How much? $50,000 a month. Nope. US$200,000.00 I see. That kind of enemy. Your life is your own to protect. Your drinks. Enjoy your flight. Pramuk's clients will all gather to witness the century's biggest deal. Time, place, guest list? I've got it. And security? X-rays, metal detectors and voice recognition just to enter. Plus a pat down. Is that all? Getting in is not the problem, then. We've got company. This should be interesting. That bastard. Stop that. Pain in the ass. Pierre, take over! Where you going? What do I do? Damn this! What do I do? What's up with this? Hit the gas! - More! - More? For real? Gas! Gas! What the fuck? I'm totally lost! Lupin! Get in! Whoa! That was close. Once again, I cut something worthless. I love that guy! Beautiful! You deceived me. I didn't want it to end this way. How long have you been there? "You deceived me." Now you know what kind of man Dawson was. I'm counting on you. What's with that getup? I wanted to watch the show next to you, Fujiko. You look foolish. It's not easy playing a role that isn't you. I had no idea you were half Chinese. Show's starting. Jigen, Goemon? Impressive, huh? He knows. Abort. What? Why? I'll explain later. Meet at the hideout. Now's not the moment to steal it from him. Too soon for that scum. What's your plan? We take him... for everything. What the hell is Lupin doing? The guy's getting away. Stop! Put it down! Why didn't you move? Sorry Gramps. I didn't feel up to it today. You dirty rat. Are you mocking me? I never said I'd help. Lupin! Sure is hot here. What gives? I guess it's just my luck. He always slips away at the last second. It's all that bumbling idiot Lupin's fault. Well? You gonna trust this guy? Huh? Dawson's not here to stop me this time. Ow, ow, ow, okay, okay! The world's fastest computer system. It's what you would need to hack The Ark. Okay, I understand that but... how'd you get one? I bought it online. It wasn't cheap. How much? 170 million. It's okay. I paid. I found 400 million lying around the other day. Who's this? Everyone, this is Joseph. A genius programmer. Genius? Him? Hm-mm? Welcome to The Ark. I see it. He's right! Amazing! We'll send Pramuk a message. It'll be the perfect revenge. Rock... rock, paper, scissors, go! How is it? Awesome. Try the oden. Sure. I'll get another bottle. I found a priceless secret buried in Dawson's data. Lupin's real name. Seriously? Tell me! What a pity. Let me see. Come on. Forget it. I've known it for a long time. What? You're kidding! Goemon. Tell me later. "Minefield GPS" What's happening? Look at this! Better report it! What is it? Leave them to me. We're in! How is coming, Fujiko? Almost there. Relax. Damn it. Keep it, twerp. Don't be dramatic. That's not going to kill ya. A manganese vault? An old friend. We're not talking about hacking here. Okay then. What did grandfather used to say? Women and safes are much alike. Both of them... are just waiting for someone to open the door. Are you sensitive to that? Or are you not? Damn! My my my. Where's Michael? He saved my life. I thought he'd get here sooner. Par for the course, I guess. Okay. You're a hard man to figure. I never said I wouldn't help. Nevertheless, after all this... I can't exactly wipe your slate clean. Wipe away my stellar resume? That would be a pity. Lupin the Third. I'm sure we'll be meeting soon. I can't wait...Gramps. Stop calling me that. Come on, you like it. Gramps! All right. Beautiful. Looks a little big. Hey! That bastard. "Nice work" So how are we getting home? Pierre, how do we get back? Uncle... Michael, Jiro... we recovered the necklace. Say Fujiko. You weren't Michael's sister, were you. I know everything there is to know about you. I just used him. To get this necklace. I don't think so. Michael was searching for his lost sister. You gave him a reason to live. By pretending to be his only family in the world. Damn, it hurts. That you'd go to such lengths for him. I get depressed just thinking about it. Tell me the truth. You were in love with... Don't try to beautify it. I serve myself...Fujiko Mine. Nothing more. I'll accept that. After all, I scored... the world's best jewel and woman. What do you mean... you "scored"? Don't play dumb. You promised. If I put this necklace on you, you're all mine. Listen Lupin. Hear that? What? Hold it, Lupin! Gramps? I told you we'd meet again soon, Lupin! I thought you might wanna see a friend. Thanks, Lupin. What did I tell you? Forget that girl. That's foul play. Fujiko! Well then, I take my leave. Huh? Hurry, they're coming!
