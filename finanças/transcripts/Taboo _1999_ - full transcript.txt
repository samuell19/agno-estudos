After Shinsengumi's relocation to Nishihongan Temple, It held a competition for new members. Initially, the company had throughout the region. Now, circumstances had changed. Next! Who have we here? That? A merchant's son. Not a spy? His master, the samurai Senzaemon Hamano, of the Shingyo Toryu school, has written to recommend him. After his apprenticeship, he taught under the master. His background? His father owns Echigoya Kimonos, a textile wholesaler near Hamano's dojo. He's the third-born son. Name? Sozaburo Kano. Soji's having trouble. This charts his lineage. Echigoya was founded in the north, the Kano district. Four centuries ago, his ancestor, Kano Utanosuke, a renowned samurai, was retainer to a feudal lord. Today, Kano's descendants are merchants here in Kyoto. They kept the ancestral 'Kano,' though by law, only samurai may use surnames. Take a look. He's the last? Hyozo Tashiro. One of our Controls suggested him. Like Kano, he fought his way up through the early rounds, without yielding once. Okita won that match, but his opponent has guts. Only those two are worth taking on. What do you say, Hijikata? Kano and Tashiro. Fine. And you, Ito san? I'll consent. I have my doubts about the wisdom of judging by swordsmanship alone, but as that is your policy... Shinsengumi exists to destroy any who defy the government. Kano, Tashiro. Commander's Quarters. Here, here, we are not lord and vassal. Come forward. Kano, how old are you now? I am almost eighteen. Eighteen? You do not toy with us? Let him be. Curious indeed. That look on Kondo 's face. I didn't think he was so inclined. Not eighteen and teaching? I remain unseasoned. No, I was impressed by the skill I witnessed earlier. You're a fine swordsman. You're Tashiro? Times are ever more troubled. I trust you would sacrifice your lives for our government. I'd like Kano for my page. Any objections? No, that's fine. It is customary. And Tashiro? What? Fine. Tashiro will learn our ways in the First Unit under Okita. So be it. Oh yes, Seijuro Muto, of the Fourth Unit, is to die tomorrow morning. Shall I order one of those two to the task? Toshi... Let's try Kano... Gohatto - Forbidden Gohatto - Forbidden To Violate the Warrior Code To Renounce the Shinsengumi To Borrow Money Without Leave To Bring Personal Suit To Engage in Private Quarrels Offenders shall Disembowel Themselves Kano. Yes. Tomorrow morning, a member of the Fourth Unit, Seijuro Muto, a free lance from Mino, is sentenced to die. We have evidence he borrowed from a merchant, claiming he was on company business. We have chosen you for his executioner. You accept? Yes. No doubt the protocol is familiar. If not, ask someone. Your Control will observe. It is a great honour. I'd heard they assign executions to newcomers. Why you and not me, Kano? The company codes are fair enough, but the military codes are severe. 'If a Unit Leader falls in battle, his entire unit must accompany him in death. ' Absurd. We'll never get out of here alive. They say the codes date from last year's battle. You're from Kyoto. Why did you join? Kano. Restless? Without sleep, you'll fail tomorrow. Sozaburo. Sozaburo. Have you ever killed a man? Have you ever known a man? I suspect he's killed before. Your forgiveness. He's got courage. No, that's something else. Who comes I am Tashiro. The other new recruit. Envious of the honour you've done my comrade, Sozaburo Kano, I wanted a peek at his sword. Spectators are forbidden at executions and suicides. I accept punishment willingly. Five days behind bars. Yes. Five Days Later Five Days Later You're free. Return to the company. To whom shall I report? A Director, my Control? Tomorrow will do. Tashiro san. Sozaburol Oh, no. In prison I kept calling, Sozaburo, Sozaburo. Did you desire help? Never. Just calling out the sweet name of my beloved... Too fast? Why do you laugh? I see, you were lonely... I'll come to you tonight. Don't you like me? Excuse me. Will you cry out? Or shall I summon help? Cry to raise the dead, but I'll sleep with you before I die. Then withdraw. I see. I'll take you to the Gion, then. The Gion? I'll treat you to a woman there instead. No women either. Sozaburo. You've never had a woman? Life keeps no secrets Within a month The word: Kano has never known a woman Hey there! Hey, Kano! Apparently, he is desired Specifically, Takeda, the Fifth Unit leader Tashiro, the other freshman Kano evades Tashiro And yet, certainly the boy arouses attention At eighteen, he keeps his beautiful locks An open invitation to those so inclined Really, it is Tashiro who deserves pity Soji. What are you doing? Playing with the brats? Yes, they're catching me some little fish. Which you'll... Eat. Soji. Are you really better? I only suffered after the Ikedaya incident. About Tashiro and Sozaburo Kano. Oh, that? It's really not for me. Men chasing each other. During the competition, did you... What? Who's the tougher fighter? Kano, definitely. Hijikata san. What was Kano thinking that day? He wasn't thinking... It was the scent. The scent? Of blood, you mean? Bored as we stood watch at Ikedaya, you wondered: When men scheme to ignite the capital, and seize the emperor himself, to hold captive in Choshu. Are such men mad? I did? They're not mad, they're lucid. But when hot-blooded men gather, arguing for months on end over a fantasy, they talk themselves into believing the government can easily be toppled. In that respect, Shinsengumi is no different. Such congregations exude a scent young men can't resist. Only the mad recognise each other? Then you're the madman-in-chief. Kano here? Yes. Let's go. I am in your debt. That'll do. Tashiro! Don't hold back, Tashiro. Weak. That's the work of a certified swordsman? Done. Just as Soji says. Tashiro is clearly a lesser warrior than Sozaburo Kano. Fight. That's curious. These two are involved... So that's how things stand. Before long, The word: Sozaburo Kano and Tashiro are lovers They're coming. The Shinsengumi's coming! That's Kondo san. Shinsengumi, Shinsengumi! Sozaburo. Tell Toshi... ...the Lt. Commander to see me. They want me to escort them to Choshu. Hiroshima, actually. So it's war, then. No, a military inquest. Why another inquest now? The occupation order was issued long ago. The other lords are hesitant and frankly, they lack funds. And, what can you do there? Investigate Choshu's offence... No, I mean you. Toshi. Look after things. Who will you take? Ito san. And I thought Takeda and Ogata. Ito san, huh. The company's been unsettled since Ito san and his philosophers joined us. I'll keep strict order while you're gone. I've been informed, that Soza... That Kano's taken a lover. I wouldn't know. In any case, it's of no consequence. Bother you? No. But it happened once before. Lust swept the ranks like a fever, about the time of the Ikedaya incident. It seemed to infect everyone. It can't happen again. Extraordinary. You're with Shinsengumi? That's right. To which school do you belong? Pure Land Buddhist. No, I mean your sword. Oh, my dojo. I trained in the same school as the young Master and Toshi san, but seem to lack the gift. I'm a lousy swordsman. Then you are not a monk of this temple, but a member of the company? Sure, I'm with the company. I'm terribly... excuse me. The look on Commander Kondo's face... Who opposed him? I'm not at liberty to say. Master Okita. Don't call me Master. How old a person? In his sixties, I would say. Don't be absurd. Even Commander Kondo is only just past thirty. We have no old men here. But he said he was with the company and studied the sword... I know. It must have been Genzaburo Inoue. So grave an insult violates the code, you'll have to kill yourself. He's by far our oldest member, but not much over forty. You guessed sixty? I have no excuse. Don't worry. It's his own fault for looking so old. And he is? He's master Inoue, leader of the Sixth Unit. Commander Kondo, Lieutenant Hijikata, old man Inoue, and I, all trained at the same Kondo Dojo, which came to Edo from the north. Some members have accused us of dominating the company. That is not our intent. I understand. But Inoue is right. He is truly useless with a sword. When you spar with him, go easy. Yet this advice proved fruitless Oh, you're the one who inquired after my sect. No, I believe I inquired after your sword training. But please forgive the insult. I did not recognise you. If you insist. Little Sectarian. I'm so busy I've no time to coach you. But some day soon, we'll spar together. I am grateful. Then, one day Oh, Little Sectarian. Shall we have a go? Yes. Take this You call that sparring... How dare you! Pursue them! Did something happen? I don't know. They were two. Ronin I'd say. The temple is vulnerable, but they were brazen. And, how did they taunt us? 'You call that sparring...' Unforgivable Was that all? They said 'Is this the best Shinsengumi can muster?' Some members confronted them, but mistaking them for guests, watched them stride away freely. We bore such insults in the early days, but now that the company arms maintain order, none should dare to breach our garrison I have no excuse. I'll willingly accept any punishment. The fault is mine. No blame lies with Master Inoue. Bear up, Kano. Calmly await company orders. In the meantime, shall we have a go? Identifying marks. One has a battle scar on his left cheek. His crest is the Three Stars. The other, in his mid-twenties, has an unusual crest. It's called the Crossed Battle Axes. Crossed Battle Axes? A rare crest. No one's sure, but they seemed to have Higo accents. If they are from Higo, they may be here to avenge the deaths of the men they lost at Ikedaya. Investigate. Immediately. And who were the two sparring in the dojo then? Inoue san and Sozaburo Kano. Surely it was Kano's youth that drew the slander. Inoue san. Oh, Toshi san. Leave such work to your assistants. I do. But I get things so much cleaner. Still, you must set an example for the men. Is that so? And Inoue san, about the incident today. I'm sorry to have caused such inconvenience. No, no. You are not at fault. But such brazen trespassers cannot go unchecked. It is for you and Kano to take care of this little matter. It's a job, then. By the way, why were you coaching Kano? Well, the Little Sectarian... I'm the one who told Kano to seek Inoue san's coaching. You did? The first drink is yours, sir. You're my guest tonight. Leave us awhile. We have secrets to discuss. Kano. Why did you hold back with Inoue san? I made no adjustment. Yes, you did. I was watching. As I watch all your sessions. Your skill surpasses Inoue san's. You weren't yourself today. That is not true. Is it because Inoue san shared the Commander's dojo? No, I don't blame you for holding back. We all restrain ourselves before them. And because of this, their authority flourishes. In theory, we're equals, but in fact they dominate us. The only alternative is flight. But if you flee, they kill you. As they did Yamanami, who escaped this spring. He was one the founders, once a lieutenant beside Hijikata. On the eve of his ritual suicide, a woman clung to the bars of his cell, wailing her grief. Such delicate feet... But, I digress... The point is, why do I watch you so closely that I recognise your self-restraint? Kano, do you know why that is? Why, is that? Because I so desire to hear the bird's first song after making love to you that I would pay for it by cutting my own life short. Sozaburo... grant me my desire. What about the servants? I've seen to them. Don't tell Tashiro. Meaning, you're... involved with him... Any developments, Yamazaki san? Inoue san. Sitting vigil again today? No word of Three Star or Battle Ax? They don't grow on trees. I've told you that your vigil only burdens us. Yet you do not retire. We've scattered men around town to hunt them down, even turned in likenesses to the magistrate's detectives. We can't quite order you to comb the streets as we have the pale-faced Sozaburo Kano. Does Kano track Three Star and Battle Ax with no clues at all? No, because their accents were of Higo, twice a day he visits the Ogawa Inn, popular with Higo folk. Sir. Sir, may I? Just in time. Follow them. Yes. But where are you bound? I'll report to you at our post in Gion, then. Awaiting someone, sir? Yes. A company aide. This way. What will you do? Go straight to the Inn. At this hour? Is it not prudent to wait for further intelligence? Where I come from, we have a saying: 'do not wait to pull the weed.' In my village, the racoons dry their coats under the crescent moon. That's how highly racoons prize their fur. Is that so? I wonder about foxes... I wonder. At the temple in Hino, there's a den of them. Famous for their cleverness. Sometimes they come to buy sake at the local shop, but they always pay by coin. Not with leaves? You'd think so. But they're genuine coins of the realm, tarnished to boot. A clever bunch. A fellow named Gen lived on the farm where Hijikata was born, short for Genzaburo, like me. Now this Gen was a master potato man. So much so that the villagers, they called him Potato Gen. 00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,320 When the local children came to play in the river nearby, they'd steal his potatoes. When old Gen died, the children carried giant potato leaves to the funeral procession. The villagers mistook them for river sprites, but I knew they weren't. Why? Why? Simple. Because I recognised the boy Hijikata among them. It's Soji. Why the get up at this hour? Believe me, it's hardly my choice. It's your fault. My fault? Inoue san. Thanks to you, he's off to die. To die? Yes. A short while ago, Inoue san left for the Ogawa Inn, that den of Higo men. He only took Kano. He means to die. Impossible. But you know how he is. He wanted to right the harm he'd done. Ridiculous. Soji, gather reinforcements. I'll take two units at once. Another thing... When you fight indoors, hold your blade as short as possible. Meaning... Grip close to the guard with both hands. Don't aim for heads, that you may better avoid ceilings and door frames. As you learned at Ikedaya. This way... Short hilt? Yes. Wait for your chance, then thrust. If you miss, repeat at once. That's the trick, but it's hard to pull off in the heat of battle. Open up. They look official. I figured they'd come, the way they tailed us all evening. How many? I couldn't see well through the lattice, but I saw only two shadows. Two? You go for reinforcements. I'll follow. I can't believe two would attack alone. I'd say they're ten. What's all the fuss? Patience now, I'm opening it. Shinsengumi. Why sir, what's the hurry? Move. Let me guide you. See? Please. Come this way. Please. Up we go. See, there's no one here. It's warm. Is that so? Surely you imagine it. You think so? Let's try the back way. It leads to the river. Madam, will you... What is it? I need to get to the river. What a lot of trouble. Bring me a ladder and five lanterns. Yes sir. Why do you need the lanterns? There you are. I see. What do you say? Have a look, Little Sectarian. Anything amiss? Seems not. Then I'll lead. I broke my leg. State your allegiance. Shinsengumi, here. Kano! Don't give out Kano! You've come around, Sozaburo. Thank God. I was worried. Good, good. Can you make it? As the year drew to a close, Commander Kondo returned from Hiroshima. That very evening, there was a banquet. Smooth. No sake equals Kyoto's. Choshu can staunchly feigns loyalty to the emperor and the government, but trust me, this is a wolf in sheep's clothing. They mobilise behind our backs. The government is lax. Unless it sends troops to Choshu's borders, occupies it and destroys its leaders, there'll be hell to pay. But Kondo san. Last year, when Choshu defied the cannons of the foreign invaders, they pledged unanimous support for isolationism. The patriots of our land lauded Choshu's stand. Are you not an isolationist? I believe I am. Surely then, you can afford to be more generous to Choshu. Unfortunately, the barbarians had superior cannons. Choshu's coastal batteries were pounded to dust. And now, heaping insult on injury the government would suppress them. Choshu is mortally wounded No warrior would attack now! No warrior... Ito san, do you suggest I am not a warrior? Yes, I do. A true warrior is defined, by the strength of his compassion. Simply said, a warrior is merciful. You need not state it so baldly. Most certainly. For during the course of our recent journey, your understanding of my opinions deepened. Hijikata san. It's true, Hijikata san. What's true? I mean that... When Commander Kondo witnessed the state of things in Choshu for himself, his vision became broader than ever. No doubt our very tolerant Commander Kondo is the only man who can control the chaos here in Kyoto. Is that so? Hijikata san, what do you make of our current problem? Not the slightest interest. Excuse me. Your return is the greatest gift. I thought you were laid up. No, I was too ashamed to face you, but decided I'd get it over with. Did you hear? He's heard the gist. How can I apologise for a blunder that cost us casualties? And your wounds? I only tumbled from a ladder. And Kano? Wouldn't want to mar that face of his. But why on earth were you coaching him? Don't tell me you too, are so inclined. I myself am not inclined at all. And yet... And yet? Perhaps I'm now a bit more inclined to incline to the feelings of those so inclined. Oh, Sozaburo... I'll not harm you. But tell me, do you love Tashiro that much? Why? Even though we're involved, you show no sign of breaking with him. Break it off. I can't. Is he so insistent? Not particularly. What is it? I'll kill... you. I wouldn't. Lieutenant, it's Control Yamazaki. What? Can't the matter wait? One of our men is dead. I'll rise. Right here. The corpse was discovered at dawn. The Magistrate recognised our uniform, and sent word. Who was it? I'm going there now. A man in the Tenth Unit, name of Yuzawa. A regular country bumpkin. Two mortal blows. In the back and stomach. Yuzawa, huh. Why do I remember him? The killer? We do not know. Retainers to the Satsuma or Tosa han are obvious suspects, but in fact we have a witness. It's easy to spot Satsuma or Tosa. Apparently, it was neither. Which leaves us... to think it was an inside job, then. Did Yuzawa have enemies in our ranks? I wonder. I'll investigate. Perhaps... Was Yuzawa so inclined? So inclined... meaning? A lover of men. Given his birth, he'd certainly be familiar... But with that face? The investigation yields no clues. I truly enjoyed myself. We'd better go. Shall I bring some tea? About Sozaburo Kano. Sozaburo? Does he now belong to one of our men? Who do you think it is? Inoue's jokes aside. Dispose of the matter, Hijikata. Dispose? You mean kill him? Have you no mercy? Kondo san, don't tell me you've fallen in love with Sozaburo. Toshi, you... You misunderstand. I did not say to kill him. I mean, for instance, have his Control, Yamazaki, acquaint Sozaburo with the taste of a woman. First of all, why does he keep those locks? He's old enough to cut them. I'll do my best. What is this weakness both Kondo and I feel for Sozaburo. You want me to take him to the geisha district? That's right. With what funds? Certainly can't use company assets, but given his family he can afford it. But for you... Kano. Control Yamazaki... How are the wounds healing? Ready for the face mask again? Yes, I'm fine. That's good to hear. Then, let's toast your recovery. Say, tonight, let's go down to Shimabara. No, I... Don't stiffen up. It's time you had a little fun. It'll improve your prowess with the sword. I'm engaged tonight... With whom? Tomorrow, then? No, I... Kano... It was no use. He resisted every inducement. Inducement? Yes. That's a good one. What's good? Sozaburo's probably scared you want to seduce him. Outrageous. Not even a possibility. It can't be helped. As far as I can tell, there's no doubt Sozaburo and Tashiro are lovers. The late Yuzawa, Takeda, Yomo... Many make advances. He must shudder, fearing that even his own Control is after him. Well, take your time. He's still a baby. That's no excuse. Kano... Kano... Kano! Kano! I have some business... Fortune smiles on the Patient In a month's time About the late Yuzawa. Yes. Yes? He did approach me. So he also loved men. And did you consent? Never. Of course not. Who exactly are you promised to? No one. You're not involved. There's no question Sozaburo and Tashiro are lovers. But I like you. Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm not trying to teach you to love men. I'm taking you to a geisha so you'll learn the pleasures of loving women. Lieutenant Hijikata wishes it, too. For your own future. You think I have a future? Don't you think of the future? Why would a rich man's son study the sword, and join the company? Perhaps because I can kill. Kano, come to Shimabara tonight. Master Takeda did too. What? He approached you too? Don't mix me up with them. Lt. Hijikata, I wash my hands. Consider it part of your professional duties. But... Consider yourself lucky. Control Yamazaki. Please take me to Shimabara tonight. I'm off duty. Fine. But let's get this straight. We're going to Shimabara for the girls. I know. In that case, tonight. Yes. Oh, no you don't. What is it? No, nothing. The girl should be gentle and kind. One of our better ones. No, your very best. Our very best? Listen, his father is the Kimono merchant. Owns Echigoya. Oh, his son. You've heard? Well, in that case, he deserves Shimabara's finest. I see. A merchant's son beats a member of Shinsengumi, does he? No, it's the combination that's invincible. And for you, sir? I'm just a chaperone. No woman for me. Give me a room and some sake and I'll be fine. As you wish. Did your sandal break? Put your foot here. Can you manage? Yes, somehow. Or shall I call for bearers? What? Don't even... Hey, there. Yes sir. We're off to Shimabara. I'll be back. Why thank you. Well, well, we've been expecting you. This way please. Welcome. Where's the hostess? Coming. Some tea? Not tea, sake. I've already spoken with your boss, but about this guest, Sozaburo Kano. His tastes incline a bit towards men and besides, this is his first woman. He's nervous. Coddle him a bit and look after things. I won't stay long. His needs will be attended to. Has Commander Kondo's page, Kano, returned to his quarters? Not long ago. Yamazaki san, it was a disaster. There was a terrible ruckus. I see. He never stopped asking for you, and completely ignored the girl. We finally calmed him down and got him into bed, but he wouldn't so much as touch the girl. I'm so sorry. I think your guest came here to sleep with you, Yamazaki san. Can't have that. Why not? This evening, perhaps? Absurd. Just teasing. Better still, why not let one of our girls cleanse your palette? No, I'm on duty late tonight. Don't mistake me. I'm Shinsengumi, Yamazaki. I've asked all the Unit leaders, to search the men for one who carries a hiltless dagger. It's not mine. I wouldn't be here if it was. I just heard from the First Unit. Tashiro's dagger is missing its hilt. Tashiro... So I see. I put you in an awkward position. Tashiro must've thought you'd stolen Kano from him. Making you a rival. I hear that such men feel fearsome jealousy. And you know, it was Tashiro who first got Sozaburo started. How dare you snatch him for yourself, eh? I didn't snatch anything. I know that. I hear Tashiro started out as a foot soldier. No, lower yet. He was a guard in the lord's mansion. That's where he picked it up. He's a good fighter, but it'll be his downfall. So he must have killed Yuzawa too. Under the circumstances, I pity him, but we cannot be lenient. Execute him. He's a madman of sorts. If we don't stop him now, who knows what havoc he'll wreak. We'd become vulnerable. Opportunists could exploit the chaos. But handle it discretely. Then, his executioner? Sozaburo Kano, I think. But thats... Brutal. Will Kano alone suffice? He and Tashiro are well-matched. No, it must be Kano alone. It may not work. If he fails, Kano may lose his life. We'll give him seconds. You and Okita. You'll do. Me... Not willingly... Me... Tashiro? I'll do my best. What can he feel? You'll be alone. Yes. Okita and I will observe. But even if your life is threatened, we cannot assist you. We're only witnesses. Yes. Kano. Why do you refuse to cut your hair? No particular... Then cut it. Please indulge me awhile. Why? I've made a vow. This will do. Why is Kano his executioner? It was Kondo's choice. His reason? I don't know. Does Kondo san fancy Sozaburo? Kondo san's not so inclined. You know that. But... But what? Kondo san never looks at the others as he looks at Sozaburo. That's... The same with you. Me... Sozaburo? Soji, don't tell me you're jealous of Sozaburo. You and Kondo san raised me from childhood. There's no jealousy in me. By the way, what about you and Kondo san? Meaning what? That there's an unspoken pact that none shall come between you. That's just how things are. But every so often, someone tries, and Kondo san may carelessly let him. Then you kill him. Soji, that's enough I read an interesting book, when I was ordered to rest in bed. It was a collection of strange, mysterious stories, called Ugetsu. One was called, Chrysanthemum Vows. A pure but poor Confucian scholar befriends an injured warrior. He takes him into his home and nurses him back to health. Affection grows between them, and not wishing to part, they take vows of brotherhood. A survivor of a defeated clan, the warrior has one last obligation. Promising to come back in the fall, for Chrysanthemum Day, he departs. Time passes swiftly and the promised day arrives. Rising early, the scholar and his mother buy chrysanthemums, food and sake, and await the warrior's return. But they wait in vain. Putting his kindly mother to bed, the scholar steps outdoors. The moon has slipped behind the hill, leaving him in darkness. As he turns to go indoors, the scholar sees a man's figure... It is the warrior, borne on the wind. His heart leaps in welcome. But the warrior seems downcast, and barely utters a word, touching neither food nor drink. Suddenly he turns and says to the baffled scholar, 'I am no longer of this world.' He'd failed miserably in his quest for vengeance. Confined in his enemy's castle, unable to escape, he'd taken his own life to keep his promise. And become a spirit carried back by the wind. A fine tale. It is. It concludes: ''Better to avoid frivolous entanglements. In other words, involve yourself only with those you trust. But, in fact, I believe it's a story about two men who've made a vow as lovers. Why else would he go so far? Taking his own life and becoming a spirit, just to keep a promise? Even the title suggests a vow between men. That's not right. What... No. Soji Don't tell me you've been in love with Sozaburo. How can you ask that? You know I'm not so inclined. I thought not. But then Soji, why do you read such a book? Read it, and then think such thoughts? Truth is, I'm not sure. I dislike them. I dislike them both. I don't like to see their faces. Even the tone of their voices repels me. But I like beautiful stories. Don't you? Here they are. You betrayed me. Tashiro san, there's evidence, that you killed Yuzawa and ambushed Yamazaki. I execute you on company orders. Wait, what evidence? Something's wrong. Sozaburol You killed Yuzawa. And you stole the hilt of my dagger for Yamazaki to find. Forgive me. What did he say? I couldn't hear. Tashiro's strength vanished. What did Sozaburo say? I couldn't hear. But I doubt we'd understand it. No doubt words they shared in bed. There's something I've yet to do. I have to go back. Soji... You didn't love Sozaburo, but Sozaburo loved you. That wretch He was too beautiful. As the men toyed with him, he was possessed by a demon.
