(soft music) (motorcycle engine humming) - Hey, Rosy. I got you this for your birthday. - Thank you. (motorcycle engine humming) - Hey, careful, he's still a virgin. (students laughing) (pleasant music) - That gear really turns me on. - Wow! - Oh gee, I think I'm gonna buy that sweater. - And what are you gonna fill it with? (pleasant music continues) - 70 marks, it's a dream. How much have you got on you? How about lending me some? I'll give it back to you this evening. It's my birthday today, and my father will simply have to cough up the money. We'll meet at the espresso bar, and we'll celebrate my birthday. (pleasant music continues) - Rosy. Well now, let us not waste this precious time with words. Today you have written, my dear... - Not quite as old as Methuselah but all the same. - Quite, but let's get to the point. I still have to get back to my chambers. My dear Rosy, I have decided that as of today to show you that we too are indeed moving along with the times, to... - And that we fully trust you. - Would you kindly stop interrupting me? Rosy, listen to me. Here we have a pair of door keys. They're your door keys. From now on, you can come and go... - Whenever you want! - Yes, until 10 o'clock, of course. - But the movies aren't over until 10:30. - You don't want to go to the cinema every night of the week, do you? - Not with the 10 marks I get every week from you! - Well, your school teacher Miss Bittner told me... - Ms. Bittner, the old hag, could never understand that young women lose all their dignity when poverty strikes. - Surely you don't consider yourself poor in our family? - You bet I'm poor, compared to the other girls. - I can see that. Here. I herewith raise your allowance to 12 marks. - That was his verdict. And now a look at my birthday gifts. Here, Babs, this lovely pair of gloves, genuine leather worth a lot more than eight marks. Just right for an expedition to the South Pole. And this is for you, Elke. A warm, droopy sweater. Room enough in there for you and a friend for your measly five marks. Hmm, what have we here? "Mornings at seven, alls right with the world," but only until 7:30. Retail price, 16.50. Your property on that deal. Or how about this? Genuine cotton lingerie. (friends laugh) Something special for the boudoir. - I'll be 85 next Monday. (laughs) - And here we've got a door key, 15 marks. - 50, going once. With name and address. (friend whistles) - Lydia Miller, 15 Maidenhead Drive. - No way. - What makes you so sure? - I work for the post office. - Forget about it then. And you, no dice? - They kind of let you down, didn't they? - With a big thud. - And our bread? - Don't worry, I'll just hawk all this junk. (upbeat lounge music) - Well, how about it, my offer's still good. - Hmm, you're right, good for nothing. (upbeat lounge music continues) Hello. - May I help you? - I just put a 40 mark down payment on this dress. I'm afraid I can't pay for it. Can I have my deposit back? - [Shopkeeper] Well, I'd love to help you, honey, but that's a no-no. - [Gentleman] 50, going once. 50, going once. 50, going once. 50, going once. 50, going one. 50, going once. (Rosy whimpers) (switch clicks) - Oh. Oh, it's you, Teddy.

We went right through school together. Now you won't even tell me what you're wearing that costume for. - Did your father call? - No, Mommy. - Hmm, well, I think I'll change and go out again. - [Inge] Okay, Mom. - Your money holding out all right? - Sure, Mom. - Bye, then. - So long, Mom, have fun! Here, this is for your birthday. Take a good stiff drink, you look like you need it. Honestly, you're worrying me. - You've got nothing to worry about. I guarantee you this dress and my reputation will both come back in the same condition. - Ripped to shreds. (Rosy chuckles) Hang on. - Hmm? - So that your date knows where the front is. - I'll kick you in the back side, and you'll know where your rear is. - That's kind of hard to miss on me. (contents rattle) Huh? Just a minute, did you bump off a nightwatchman? - Hey, don't touch those, I'll explain. - I'm all ears. - Not now, some other time. Stop staring at me. Don't be a spoil sport, please. (upbeat lounge music) - Hey, watch your step! This here's my beat! (upbeat band music continues) (jarring music) (somber music) (glasses clinking) (shoes clacking) (patrons chattering softly) (somber music continues) - If you've got anything on under that coat, you can check it downstairs. (patrons chattering softly) Hold it! First door to your right. Mm-hmm, down the stairs! Looks like school's out. - You were young once yourself, you know. - What have we got here? What cradle did you fall out of? - I'd like to check my coat, please. - Oh, very well, very well. Anything you say, anything you say. (soft music) - Hmm. - Now listen, this is no place for you. Why don't you go to a nice place for young people. - Who do you work for, the vice squad? I can do anything... - Sure you can, but you shouldn't. You're too young for this place, dear. Why don't you wait until you're older? - I'm old enough now. - The trouble is you're just the age they're looking for up there. - The first steps down the garden path are always a bit hesitant. (soft music continues) - May I, may I have a... Give me a French cognac. - Well, I'll tell you what, if I were her father... - Save your remarks for another time and give the young lady what she ordered. I'll take care of that. Afraid you'll have to finish the game without me tonight. I have got work to do. Keep your eyes open. Maybe you'll learn something. (soft music continues) - You sure put him in his place. After all, I've been old enough to vote for almost a week. - No doubt. It would give me great pleasure if you would permit me to join you in a drink. - Sure, why not? (glasses clank) (somber music) - I've taken the liberty of reserving a coach for the two of us. - Sure, why not? - If you'll allow me. (somber music continues) - Well, I really needed that cognac. - I understand. I can see this is a crucial moment in your life. - Is it that obvious? - Let's face facts. Now, you came in here because you wanted some company, mature company. Well, you found it right here. And furthermore, you are afraid, right? - Mm-hmm. - You're afraid because it's the first time, right? - Mm-hmm. - You've got nothing to worry about, believe me. First you'll have a glass of champagne with me. - But I want you to go ahead. - Oh, what's the reason for that? - We mustn't be seen together. I'll be along later. - What, at your place? - This is for the garden gate, and this is for the main door. No, I better not. - Oh, come on. We can play a game of bridge if you change your mind. How about it? - But I need a deposit for the key. Your driver's license or... - So you say you want a deposit? Well, how about this? Let's call it an advance. And if you're nice, there may be more. - Two Dogwood Lane. It's a villa, 10 minutes from here. (patron clears throat) (patron laughs) - Well, my dear friends, good hunting to you as well! (somber instrumental music continues) - Oh! - Oh, I knew it. It wasn't as much fun as you expected, huh? - I know. I suppose I should have listened to you to begin with. You were right. - Young kids never want anyone's advice, especially someone who works in a check room. Well, it's the younger generation for you. You'd be surprised how much I've learned in this place over the years. Why, I can tell at a glance what's going on. They all think they're fooling me. All these people pretending to be somebody else. I can tell a virgin a mile away, and that's how I recognized you, my dear. - Here I thought I was doing such a good show, and you saw right through me. (footsteps tapping) (keys jangling) (key rattling) (vibrant vocal music) (vibrant orchestral music) (upbeat disco music) - Down the hatch, kid, hm! (upbeat disco music continues) Get lost. Make way for Mr. Universe. Let me help you down. (grunts) (chuckles) Hmm. (patron chuckles) (upbeat disco music continues) Allow me introduce myself. The name's Mugsy, the blood hound of Barcelona. - Woof-woof! - Never heard of me? Don't you watch wrestling? I specialize in full Nelsons and choke-holds. (laughs) But you can call me Freddy. Mugsy is my psycho-nym. - Pseudonym. - Hmm, never heard of him. Where does he wrestle? I can pay better than him. - What for? (lips smacking) - That's what for. Feel that muscle. - Hmm, that's nice. - There's more where that came from. Mind if I take you home? - No, not to my house. What if they see us? Uh-uh, I guess not. - What if I come later? - Come later? - Mm-hmm. - Well, if you want to. - Well, anything you want. - Go on ahead. - Where to? - 20 Ox Carriage Place. This is the key for the main door, and the flat one's for the front door. - See you soon. - Not so fast. - I was gonna go warm up the apartment for us. - How about a deposit, a driver's license or... - Okay, driver's license. How about some bread? - What do you think I am, sir? - Forget it. - I'll return it to you when I get home. - Oh, make is snappy! Oh, what's your name honey? - Annie. - Annie what? - It's on the door, bloodhound. - Woof-woof! (chuckles) (upbeat disco music continues) - Check! (footsteps tapping) (pleasant music) (footsteps tapping) - Huh? (pleasant music continues) (key clanks) Huh? Oh! (door buzzes) (pleasant music continues) (door bangs) (key clanks) Huh? (dog barking) - [Resident] Who are you, what do you want? (dog barking) - They call me the Bloodhound of Barcelona! I gotta get out of here! (dog barking) (dog feet pattering) This ain't no way to treat a brother! Jesus! Don't you recognize a fellow bloodhound! (dog barking) (wood cracking) (Freddy groans) (dog barking) Will you get off? Woof-woof! (groans) (dog barking) Where is she? (mellow lounge music) Get out of my way. - Hey, get out of here! - Where is that little two-timing tease? Get her out here, where is she? Do you want your head taken off? You know what I'm gonna do with you, you little punk? I'm gonna tear you limb from limb! - I tell you, I've never seen her before in my life! - You want you liver served for breakfast? - Let go of me! (groans) - Where is she, where is she? Where is that? Where is she! - Hey, there's Inge. - [Friend] Me too. - Hi. - Hi! Betsy. - But you only owe me eight. - Keep the change. - Oh, thank you. - Elke. - Thanks. - And this is for you. - Where'd you get this money all of a sudden. - Why, money grows on trees, so all she had to do was pick it up. - Ah ha, yeah, sure. - I said she picked it. She wasn't picked up. - I earned it babysitting. I picked up my month's salary yesterday. - Oh, go on, tell us another one. - I'll bet that's some baby. (students chattering) - What you call me for? - Well, I want you to call my parents and imitate a professor for me. I told them I was going to babysit for a physicist family. - Physics, and I just flunked that for the fourth time. - The next time I'll sit for a football player. - Okay, I'll do it. That's only enough for one call. And who you really sitting for? - Don't ask questions. Give me a lift instead, huh? - Hop on. (motorcycle engine revving) (quirky instrumental music) - Hmm, thank you, my dear. And a dash of tonic, please. Thank you. (liquid splashes) Thank you, both of you. (quirky music continues) - [First Observer] Yet another ritual. It would seem that Doms enjoy ritual more than anything else. Most of them prefer to passively watch others doing something. They seem to do little for themselves. (quirky music continues) (quirky instrumental music) (hands clap) (quirky instrumental music continues) (hands clap) (quirky instrumental music continues) (hands clap) (quirky instrumental music continues) (somber instrumental music) (hands slap) (somber instrumental music continues) - You know, darling, I... (somber instrumental music continues) She's green, she's bloody green! She's like a traffic light! Look, I say, look! Wait, my hat! - Do you bloody mind? - My hat! Thank you. Look, am I green, am I green? Tell me, am I green? - [First Observer] And reportedly turned green. Please advise. (somber music continues) (audience applauding) - [Emcee] And now, ladies and gentlemen, Adam and Eva, in their artistic presentation entitled The Fall, Before and After. (somber music) - [Second Observer] Data Bank reports cause of green hue is intake of alcohol, which has negated your red factor. Evacuate at once. - [First Observer] How. - [Second Observer] Suggest energetic agitation of body similar to that adopted by Active Doms. (somber music continues) - [First Observer] I'm proceeding towards Active Doms now. (somber music continues) - [Patron] Hey, what's going on here? (patron laughs) (patrons chattering) She must be the servant then. Adam and Eva and the servant. (patrons laughing) (patrons chattering) - Ich, there's a girl on stage. - Hey, don't notice. - But George, she's green. - Nice idea. (patrons chattering) (patrons laughing) - [Patron] Hey, get 'em off! (patrons chattering) (patrons laughing) - Piss off, this is our bloody spot! - [Patron] Hey, come on. Hey, oh, hey! - [Patron] Put her down, put her down, boo! (patrons laughing) - The beds over here. Somewhere. Where are you? (chuckles) Gooey? (gentleman chuckles) Gooey? (laughs) There you are. Well, what do you think? - What purpose do they serve, these balloons? - Oh, just one of my funny ways, you know. We all have them. A certain tactile stimulating effect, wouldn't you say? Don't you feel it? - No. - Oh, but a certain piquant addition to one's pleasure. - Pleasure, what is that? - Oh. Oh! Oh! (balloon pops) Oh, what a sweet innocent you are. Pleasure is my intent. Presently. Come this way. (gentleman moans) Well. Hmm. (hat thuds) Oh. Mm, ho. (gentleman moans) (lips smack) (gentleman moans) (gentleman moans) (lips smack) Tell me, sweetness. Have you ever, you know, been alone with a man before? - No. - Oh. Oh. How utterly delicious. We must make this something special. Something really special. Oh! Shantung silk, isn't it? - Is it? - Oh! Oh. Oh, how utterly delicious. Oh! Oh now, you just, you just sit, sit there quietly for a minute. And I'll, I'll slip into something a little more comfortable. Oh. Mm, yes. I won't be more than a flash. Ow! Oh! Damn and blast, oh! I can't see a bloody thing! It's all right, sweetness. Nothing for you to worry about. Don't disturb yourself. (laughs) - [First Observer] Report state of subject. - [Second Observer] Dom's bodily reflexes similar to those of previous subject in Holograph Hall. Possible breakdown of reason. This could lead to primitive instincts being aroused. (mellow music) - Where are you, sweetness? Ow! Where are you, you silly bitch? Oh. (balloons popping) - [Second Observer] We are taking the precaution of erecting a defense mechanism at all vulnerable places in your body. - Oh. (laughs) Oh, there you are. - [First Observer] But why? This could prove interesting. - [Second Observer] Also dangerous. We don't want you changing color again. I repeat, defensive measures have been taken. - Relax. I know you're a little nervous. This being your first time and all that, but you just relax. (gentleman moans) (lips smack) Oh. Oh, my dear, this will be a moment that you and I will remember for the rest of our lives. (jarring music) (gentleman groans) What have you got in there? - What happened? - What happened? I got a bloody great electric shock! That's what happened! Oh, whoa! Ooh! What is it? One of those Japanese electric sex toys or what? (groans) Girl, you should have some compassion. You could have ruined me for life! - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, I, oh. (gentleman groans) Oh. Listen, you promise you won't do it again. - I'm sorry if I shocked you. - All right. All right. - [Second Observer] I'll say this for the boy. He's a trier. - [First Observer] Please remove barrier. He is shocked enough. - [Second Observer] Negative. - Well, I suppose as you've given me your promise, we could, we could overlook it this time I think. (gentleman moans) (gentleman groans) (hand pats) Women's lib! They put you up to this, didn't they, hmm? Oh. (balloons rustling) Well, you won't win. Remember, it was a man who invented penicillin! Tell your playmates that! (balloons rustling) (somber lounge music) Oh, bloody hell. (balloon pops) (balloon slaps) (balloon pops) (soft lounge music) (Gentleman clears throat) - The big one's for the garden gate. The flat one for the front door. - Right. Now then, I hope you don't keep me waiting too long. The address? - Alton House Street Number Two. Don't be offended, but what happens if we both get home and you're not there and the key isn't there either? - But really, I give you my word that under, I mean under no circumstances would I tell you a lie. - That's all very well, but we don't even know your name. - How about a little deposit? Driver's license maybe? - No, no, I make a point of never parting with documents. You must understand that this is very unfamiliar territory for me. What's wrong with the three of us went on there together. - Out of the question. The neighbors keep their eyes on our every move. (soft jazz music) - How about a little something as key money you understand? In case you have to get yourself new keys made. - Well, all right, sure. - Yeah, why not? - Never done this before. But why not? And you can take a drink from the fridge if you want. - Great. (friends chuckle) (soft jazz music continues) Check please! Table over there. (soft jazz music continues) (friends laugh) - 100 marks, 100 marks! (vibrant operatic music) (tenor singing in foreign language) - Beautiful. So sorry Rosy didn't come. - Shh. (tenor singing in foreign language) - Just imagine how much work the famous mistresses had to put in. - It's not that simple, don't kid yourself. You must have a heap of sensitivity and a pinch of psychological insight. Each mark is a different case, you understand? - You handle the situation awfully well. You can make a pro anytime. - My toughest case was a freestyle wrestler. He was a big tough guy like that one. (screams) - Hey, I've been looking for you, you cheatin' broad! - Oh! (friends shouting) - My bag! - Okay! - Stop, come here! Let me get my mitts on her! - Don't let him catch me! Stop him! I'll meet you later at the Green Horse. (Rosy whimpers) - Hey, you're the wrong broad! Let go of me! I'll dig you later. (Rosy whimpers) - After him! - Just a minute, mister. - Hey chicky, I know you in there. You open that door and fork over them 100 clams I gave you. Plus the price of the pants that dog ripped! Open up, I tell you! I'll pull this joint down around you ears! Open this door, I swear I'll call the police! I swear, I'll call 'em! - Hey Mister, the men's room next door. - If she ain't out of there in two seconds, I'm gonna break it! - Get out! - Okay, I warned ya. I'm coming in after ya! (key rattles) (pleasant music) (key rattles) - [Officer] You need a bit more light? - No thanks, on the contrary. - [Officer] In other words, you'd rather work in the dark. Is that it? - Would you kindly stop shining that light in my face? Oh, I'm sorry, officer. I mean to say, what do I need light for? When I was just on the point of leaving. - [Officer] You're leaving, you say? - Yes. - So why have you been fiddling like a madman at that keyhole? I've been watching you for the last 10 minutes, and I've got the impression you were struggling to get in. - I must say, you're a very observant young man, and you'll certainly go far. (chuckles) I did want to get in, but I've just changed my mind. I've decided to take a walk around the block. Good night, officer. Good night. - Just a minute, sir. Do you live in that house? - Well, of course. That is, I don't know. - You'd better make up your mind. Do you or don't you? - Well, it's not that easy to explain. You see, I've been staying here with a friend of mine. - Maybe you'll be good enough to tell me your friend's name. - Yes, well. - Well, so you are staying with a friend, and you don't know his name. Do you happen to have any identification on you? - Yes. No, I haven't got it with me. - Isn't that strange, just what I thought. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to come along with me to the station. This just happens to be the residence of the Soviet commercial attache. (gentleman gasps) Stop! Stay where you are! Stop! (footsteps tapping) - I can still stay on my feet in an 85 wind and 85 proof. 85 proof whiskey isn't going to knock me over either. (smooth jazz music) - Why don't you get that bum out of here? The other customers are getting annoyed. - The other customers. - The others don't like it, they can get out. - Ah! - Good evening. - Oh! Man, ship ahoy. Let me get rid of him, and I'll be all yours, baby. - Not tonight, I'm meeting someone. - You're meeting me. Better think it over carefully, you're missing a big chance! Why, we were six months in the frozen North. We just got in today and we're thawing out fast! - Sure. - I'll call a taxi, okay? Oh! Lars. Help me bail him out. This vessel is sinking fast. - Don't give me orders, I'm not your crew. - Oh, you can't abandon a sailor in distress. All you have to do is lean up against him, and I'll be back in a second. - Ah! Tell me. - If I put him in his berth and come back immediately, will you be still waiting for me? - I'm meeting my girlfriend. - I don't mind a girlfriend. What you doing then? - My handbag's over there. Would you get it for me? - I'd be delighted to. - Thanks. - Well, here you are. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Why don't you go on ahead? - What? Go on ahead. - Yes. - Oh, ship ahoy! (sailor mutters) - This one is for the house, and this one is for the gate. - The gate. - And my parents are on holiday, so there's no one there. There's plenty to drink in the fridge. And I'll be there in about a half an hour to three-quarters of an hour. - Half an hour to three-quarters of an hour. (couple moaning) (soft jazz music) How 'bout that? - Ah! (sailor groans) - (laughs) Oh, your address? - 37 Mozart Street. - 37 Mozart Street, mm-hmm. - You're just ridiculous! - Why would you let yourself get involved with those two? - Why don't you help me hold him up? - I've got better fish to fry. You're doing okay. - Okay. - Oh, I forgot. You've gotta give me a deposit, driver's license or something. - Driver's license? - Security for the keys. - Hmm, oh, I see, mm-hmm. You know you're quite right, clever girl. (soft jazz music continues) There you are. - Oh. (sailor groans) - Come along, old soul. - Oh no, his driver's license. - Care for a drink now? - Yes, a cognac. Make it a French one. (upbeat disco music) Over here! Hey, did he catch you? I left right after you did. - No, he didn't catch me. Hand me my bag, will you? - Uh huh. - A coke and cognac for me, please. Oh, and you can forget the coke. - Well, what happened? - I had to crawl out the lady's room window. If you have tried it, you'd still be stuck there. - Oh, come off it. - Boy have I had it. - (laughs) I gave it a try myself. - What? - You know, the key cantata. I tell you though, I need more practice. - Why? - Look what he gave me for security. He really handed me his driver's license. - [Rosy] He looks like some kind of seal hunter. - He mentioned having something to do with ships. He was way up North for six months. Hmm. He got me so worked up, I didn't know what I was doing. When I gave him the keys, he put his arms around me. That's when he kissed me, and I flipped out. I was so mixed up that when he asked me for the address, I gave him yours by mistake. I blew it, I guess. (upbeat disco music continues) Hey, what's bugging you, Rosy? - I want you to think carefully. You gave him my address, my genuine address? - Sure, but I didn't give him the keys to your house. I gave him the others. - Every one of those other keys is a copy of our key. (Inge gasps) - That's what you get for not telling me the whole story, you idiot! And what do we do now? - Lord, please send out a bolt of lighting, a well-aimed bolt of lighting, and destroy that silly cow over there. (car engine humming) (key rattling) (gate creaking) (tense music) (light switch clicks) (footsteps tapping) (light switches clicking) (tense music continues) (lips smacking) (tense music continues) (sailor chuckles) (car engine humming) (car door bangs) - Thank you. - That's funny, I could have sworn I turned that light out. - Huh. Oh, I suppose Rosy must have come home, and she must have turned on all the lights as usual. (Father hums) (couple hums) - Well, I just have to tell you again, your home here is simply wonderful. - [Father] Thank you very much. (Father hums) - It really would be a shame to have to leave this wonderful home of ours, unless, what's the expression? We have to heed the call of nature? - You mean duty, of course. - We must heed when duty calls. Am I right, Oswald? - Yes, of course you are, darling, as usual. - Well, it's certainly understandable after having lived in such a lovely house all these years. But we manage to keep ourselves fairly diverted. (couple laughs) - Oh, well, ladies. Ladies. - If you'll excuse me for a moment, I'd love to introduce you to our daughter. - How delightful. - Ooh-hoo! Rosy, wake up you sleepy head! (Mother screams) (Mother groans) - Oh. Oh, you know how it is when mother and daughter start chattering. I'll be back in a minute. - Have a drink, Madam. It'll do you a world of good. There, there. - What the hell's going on here? You cat! You devil! You sex maniac! - What? - You exhibitionist! - But you don't understand. (door slams) (Rosy groans) (men chattering) - [Sailor] If you'll just let me speak. (men chattering) - Evening. - Mm-hmm. (men chattering) - I'm warning you, I'm warning you. I once strangled a polar bear to death with my own hands. - Daddy, let him go! - What? What's going on? Good Lord, good Lord, Matilda. Will you please stop painting? This isn't the appropriate time for that. - I thought you promised me that you'd stopped drinking? - What, what did I promise? - Did you promise me or didn't you me? - Me? - Will you please tell my why this creature of all people should tell you to stop drinking? - We're going to marry. - What? You're getting what? - Rosy! - Will you please stop fainting? - We're going to be married. May I introduce you, Dr. Walter Bertram, my parents. So that's the sort of man you are. After you promised me you'd take care of the whole business. We didn't announce our engagement publicly because I was afraid you'd think he's too old. You should be ashamed of yourself. You could have bought a nice bouquet and rung the doorbell like a decent gentleman when I wasn't able to meet your ship. He was up on the North Pole for over six months, way up north, exploring. - What was he exploring? - What the hell do I care what he was exploring for up north? What's he exploring for in this bed? - If you'll just let me... - Will you please keep quiet. If that old bat from Bonn overhears this. - How can you talk like that about people you need so much? - Absolutely. If you insist on screaming your lungs out, then scream somewhere else! - I want to get dressed! - I should bloody well hope so! - It's a little North Pole hysteria. Don't worry about it. You go downstairs and look after our distinguished guest. We'll be down shortly and explain everything. - [Father] That child since the day she was born, oh my God. - I'll get you for this, you beast. - Now just a second, I'm not a beast. And furthermore who... - Hmm? - Oh, wow. (Father chuckles) (Father clears throat) - Is anything the matter? - No. What could be the matter? - A delightful surprise. - Yes. Our daughter's fiance arrived most unexpectedly. - His name is Rosy, and they're old friends. - Of course, our daughter's name is Rosy. His name is Walter. - He believes he's a bit too old for her. - Oh really? - Good heavens, we are forgetting our visitor. Wouldn't you like your glass refilled? - I must say that's quite a little surprise you've had there. Now tell me, does he live far away? - Up in the ice. - Up in the North Pole. - Well, how very interesting. Is he an explorer? - Yes, so they call it, yes. (coughs) - Dr. Bertram is a... - How nice for him. - Yes. - His father has one also. - What kind of nonsense is this you're blathering on about, my sweet little feather brain, hmm? - His father has a job too. - Bet he does. - Is he also an explorer? - Yes, he's a pastor. - Oh, you mean a missionary? - Yes, but that doesn't worry us. - So you want to know the truth, do you? - Yes, mm-hmm. - All right. Inge, that little idiot. She said she'd give the keys to one of the senior boys. He comes over when my parents are out of the house. I'm just madly in love with him. But Inge's in love with him too, and that's why she decided to pull a fast one on us. Is this making any sense? - No. If she wanted to pull a fast one on you, she wouldn't give the keys to a perfect stranger. I take it your father would be just as upset if he found one of your classmates in your bed, wouldn't he? - I guess. Partly, I guess it was because she knows that old cow was going to spend the night here, the one downstairs by the fireplace. - A cow downstairs? - That old cow by the fireplace. I just didn't wanna foul up daddy's promotion. - What does your daddy do? - Didn't you know? He's a federal district court magistrate. And he'll never be promoted if they found out his daughter. He's under consideration for a job in the Ministry of Justice reforming the penal code. - A juvenile delinquent specialist, no doubt. - Oh, please help me out of this. It isn't half as bad as it looks. Just play along with the game long enough for me to get dad out of the trouble I got him in. Come on downstairs with me. - Well, okay, but only because you asked me so sweetly. (soft jazz music) Hmm? Oh, yes. The ice began to crack horribly and we all woke up. - How exciting. - Yes, indeed. But we already know the whole story by heart, don't we? - What? - Oh, come now. The ice began to crack and you know that story. - Yes, of course. - But how is our visitor going to hear the story if you keep on interrupting? - Yeah. - They all went to bed and that was what broke the ice. - Not quite. - Sounds scintillating. - The fact is when the ice breaks in the Arctic, a bang is let out that the whole country reverberates. - I could just picture the scene. - Impossible. I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you on that point, but you couldn't possibly picture the scene. It's a, it's a sound... It's a sound that makes your blood freeze in your veins, you understand? - Oh? - Well, at least to the poor devil standing on the ice that's breaking. (lips smacking) Cut it short. The wounded polar bear growled horribly, and then he leapt forward and grabbed for our dog team! - How did the polar bear get in your bed all of a sudden? - You might as well ask how did the dog team get into his bed? I ask you. That's an absolutely ridiculous question. Why, there are so many polar bears up there they turn the country black. - But I thought polar bears were white. - You give me the blues. (hand pats) (sultry jazz music) - What are you doing? - Rosy! - Huh? - Oh, I'm, I'm terribly sorry. - You must excuse them. - You must... I was... I was taking her up to. Would you be good enough to get my coat, darling? - No. - What do you mean no? Go and get his coat, my sweet. - He'd catch a cold if he goes out in the dark in this heat. - Nonsense! If he's used to the North Pole, he'd be all right. - Yes, I better go. - You're not leaving? - Yes, my dear lady. You see, in real life. Oh, good evening. - Good evening. - Mm-hmm. In real life, as the poet says, things are seldom what they seem, I'm afraid. Life's no bowl of cherries. - No. - Well, it was really delightful to have made your acquaintance. - If you're really going to let the two of them part like this, then I'll, I simply don't know what I'll do. - All right, then we'll terminate this delightful evening, and we'll all go to bed! - Good idea! - To get some rest! - But, sir... - Hold on, it's all right. I can lend you a night shirt. Come along. - Thank you, sir. - And the least you could do is to ask our visitor as well! - Why, of course, my dear lady. Don't be shy. (group laughing) - You heard that one? The one about the traveling salesman who spent the night with his own wife? - [Officer] Come along with me, please. - You'd better be nice to pops here. - Well? - Well, thought it over yet? - How often do I have to tell you I can't say anything? - I'm afraid you'll have to. - Don't let him scare you! All he's got is a rubber billy club! - Shut your mouth, will you? (prisoner laughs) You'd save yourself a lot of unpleasantness if you did talk. - I can assure you, it'll be just as unpleasant for you if you don't release me this very minute. - Needless to say, you are gonna call all your influential friends, the mayor, the public prosecutor, and I suppose you have a beer every week with the Minister of Justice. - (laughs) And what if I did? - Isn't that funny? Decent citizens never know anyone, but the crowd that comes in here always claims to have the best connections. If that were true, the mafia would be running the country. Now, why don't you talk. - Now, you're a police officer. - Yeah. - And with the benefit of some of the best training in the world, plus years of experience, surely you can realize that I am not a defendant. A law breaker. Why, there's nothing criminal about me. That must be clear. Oh, I mean, my appearance alone should reveal that fact. - Quite frankly, I couldn't care less about your appearance! I just want to know your name! - (laughs) You've never heard of incognito, immunity, hmm? - Until we catch 'em, they're all incognito. And immunity, it's just a detour around the law before which we are all equal. - As public servant, you have no right to give anyone legal instructions! - And as a member of the public, you have an obligation to account for your behavior. - Out of the question. - Then back you go. - All right! - How about that? Pops is here again. (laughs) (pleasant music) (switch clicks) (switch clicks) (pleasant music continues) (guest gasps) - Oh! Pardon me, wrong window. So sorry to have troubled you. (pleasant music continues) (maid screams) I'm here, darling. You'll wake everyone up! (maid screams) (Mother gasps) Oh! Every one of you, you are all witnesses. I wanted to go home. She insisted that I stay. - That's a lie, I was fast asleep! I woke up, he was on top of me trying to... - Get out of my house! - Your Honor, your magistrate. I swear the only girl I wanted to sleep with was your daughter, not with this girl. - Good heavens! - I said get out! - Yeah. - Well. Let me handle this, my dear. Dr. Bertram. - Uh huh. - I beg you, don't be so hasty. - My dear lady, I don't think you can call a man hasty who's just spent six months on an ocean voyage if he... - Of course. A man has basic urges, and I assure you I can appreciate the desires. And that's why I'm begging you to stay with us. Come along. Now then, why don't you leave all the details to the ladies? - Well, quite frankly, after everything I had to listen to tonight. - [Father] Rosy! - Wha, what? (tense music) - (gasps) Oh no. Whatever did you do that for, Daddy? - March the 17th, Candlelight Bar. Man with spectacles, 100 marks. March the 17th, Old Joe Bar. A wrestler, a pushover, 100 marks. March 20th, City Bar, businessman. - Please, Daddy, don't jump to conclusions. I can explain. - Have you told him? - Ngh-ngh. What are you going to do, Papa? - What a man in my position is obliged to do on discovering that his daughter has become a trollop. - But, Papa. - Dr. Bertram. - Yes, sir? - I'll have to ask you once more to leave my house at once. - Oh, you don't have to ask me to leave. I'll leave on my own accord. And if I never see this nut hatch again, it'll be too soon! And as for your daughter, you can, you can stick her in a nunnery! - Unless, of course... Unless of course you agree to an official engagement, which would have to be celebrated this evening. Which is, which is to say, if you still think my daughter is good enough for you. (soft jazz music) - Well, all right. If it means so much to you. - I thank you. Rosy, come here, darling. Now then, I herewith announce the engagement of my daughter Rosy to Dr. Walter Bertram. The engagement will be celebrated this evening, and an appropriate public announcement will be made in keeping with my position. - Well. - Wonderful. I've already accepted your invitation, of course. Oh, and by then my husband will have arrived. He always lends tone to this sort of celebration. You'll have to stay at home away from the bride. Tell me, have you told your parents yet? - My... - After meeting you, I can... - If you can just kindly excuse me for a moment. If this individual... I've already mentioned it. My wife and I have already told the under secretary's wife that we've already met your parents. Yes, I know. And I also told her they live here in town. - Yes, but... - Now that the Under Secretary of State and his wife have accepted the invitation then your parents had better turn up. - Parents? Oh. Oh, well, I suppose under the circumstances, no one will notice the difference. - Good lad. - Good morning, your Honor. - Morning. - Shall I bring in Mr. Anonymous from Bonn now? - What? I thought the man wouldn't talk. How did you find out all of a sudden he is from Bonn? - We found a receipt among his personal effects, from a bar called the Fly Swatter, and the only bar by that name in the country is in Bonn. - I don't think that proves anything. Why I quench my thirst in Bonn myself. You can show him in. (quirky music) You? (commissioner laughs) Prisoner, if you fail to recognize the seriousness of the matter, I shall be obliged to dismiss this case on grounds of insignificance. - (laughs) What? You call a night spent in the police station insignificant? (laughs) - Did you spend the night with that district magistrate or a waitress? - Two of them. - What? - Waitresses. (commissioner laughs) Sure, sure, very funny. - That's the funniest thing that's happened around here in ages. (both laughing) - Lean forward. (mouth blows) Does my breath smell of alcohol? - 90 proof. Well, here's all the best to your wife. And the next time you paint the town red, count me in. - Have you ever made a decision you felt sorry for later? - Ngh-ngh, only the unimportant ones. - Are you picking me up for lunch? - I don't know yet. It all depends on how fast I can produce a set of parents for your father. I still don't believe it. First he dumps his daughter and me to further his career, then he insists that I scare up a set of parents. Well, if he thinks he's the only schemer in town, he's in for a surprise. Here you are. - So long. - So long. (gentle music) - Quick, give me a kiss. - Hmm? - Come on, hurry! - [Friend] Rosy! - Your daughter called up and left a message that Dr. Bertram reserved a table in the Chinese restaurant for seven. The lady from Bonn is at the hairdresser's, and His Honor, your husband, has been drinking. (flame crackling) - What are you doing, Oswald? What's the meaning of this? What are you walking around in your robe for? Get away from the fireplace or you'll catch on fire. You're behaving as if you're the first father whose daughter ever got married. - Leave me alone! It's the very least I can do for your honorable daughter's future. - Pull yourself together. You can't show up in front of his parents like that. - It's the only way I dare to! - What kind of nonsense is that? And what's that you're throwing in the fire. - Your daughter, the past history of your daughter. And I'm laying my own future to rest as well. I can forget that promotion. I don't deserve it. (Mother groans) - Lilly, go to the pharmacy immediately and get three large rolls of Alka Seltzer. And you get in bed at once! And stay up there! - I'm high enough as it is! - Getting drunk in the middle of the day. There's no reason for it. If I were you, I'd be ashamed! - If I only weren't such a wretched coward, I'd put an end to this whole ugly business this very minute! - Oswald, for heaven's sake! Let go of that thing at once! - Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me. - Let go! - Leave me alone! Leave me alone, I tell you! (gunshot blasting) (quirky music) - Good afternoon, I believe you're expecting me. My name's Stubenagel, from the Ministry of Justice in Bonn. (quirky music continues) I do hope I'm not troubling you. Are you quite sure, Madam? Are you quite sure that you are feeling all right? - Oh, quite. I'm fit as a fiddle. My daughter's celebrating her engagement tonight. - (laughs) I see. Well now, is your husband at home? - Yes. Your wife is at the hairdresser's. She simply didn't want to miss the engagement party. - Of course. And your husband? - My daughter's fiance was good enough to make a reservation at the Chinese restaurant for us to have a simple celebration. He's an assistant professor of polar bear psychology at the North Pole. - Oh really? - Oh, did I tell you my husband isn't feeling well? I'd be grateful if I didn't have to wake him. - I understand. You don't want to disturb your husband's nap. - Exactly. - So you shoot at crows from the window. - You know you never can get enough practice. What, with all the threatening letters and phone calls you get. A magistrate and his wife simply must keep up their marksmanship. You must understand things will start looking up when his promotion comes through. (Father sings) Would you care for a brandy? - Yes, I believe I could do with a brandy now. (Father sings) - Oh, that. That must be the plumber. - Oh, yes. - We're having the drains fixed. - In which case I'll leave you to him. Could you tell me where this hairdresser's is? I see, don't bother. We'll be seeing each other this evening.

The only thing he's good for is drinking. - I'm looking for a father. - A what? - A father. Now, haven't I always been like a father to you, my boy? - Well, I've gotta get married. - So she hooked you, did she? - Well, sort of, for appearances sake. Or maybe not. The point is, my future father-in-law wants parents, and I haven't got any. - You never needed them before. - I'll be your father. What have I got to do for you, boy? - Oh, just stave off the barnacles and show up at the engagement party. - How about a mother, you need one of those? - [Walter] Well, yes, but... - I'll be your mother. - That's nice of you. It's this way, Minnie. - Yeah? - I was looking for a somewhat older mother, you understand? - Old mothers are always breaking down. Besides, I wanna look over this two bit broad of yours. - Oh, oh. Minnie, you keep your mouth off that girl, otherwise I'll have to. - Ah, pull in your fins, boy. Otherwise you'll have. - Okay, forget it. Now then, dear parents, this is the story. - Ah, here we are. Good evening. My daughter's getting engaged this evening. - You must try and control yourself. It's supposed to be a surprise. You must excuse him, my dear. My husband is so nervous. - Hey, look at the poor devil. Give him a month at the most. - Oh, the poor man! - My dear parents-in-law. - What did he say, his what? - Good evening. - Good evening, ladies. Judge Baumgartner, won't you take a seat? Allow me to introduce you, Federal District Magistrate Baumgartner, my mother. - Delighted, I'm sure. - Ah yes, my father. - Pleased to meet you. - Rosy, your father's had just a little bit too much to drink. You're going to have to help keep him quiet. And the gentleman from Bonn is already in town. - With your permission. Attention, everybody. My husband and I have ordered this little surprise for the evening with our very best wishes. (Walter laughs) - Daddy, keep your seat. You can sit down for your speech. - Well, let him stand up if he wants. - No. - Why not? - We are gathered here rather precipitously. On this wretched occasion. It seems like only yesterday that little Rosy was playing with her dolls. - I'm so glad my husband isn't here yet. - Well, what's going on there? And now she's given her heart to a complete stranger, and a very good friend of the family. (belches) Walter, if you'll permit me to call you that. - With pleasure, sir. Daddy. - I want you to bear in mind that my daughter hasn't the foggiest notion what the world is all about. What, leave me alone. (Freddy screams) What does that fellow want? - Oh! - Oh! - Where are you going? Come back, the soup hasn't been served yet! - Rosy! - Ah, very good evening to one and all of you. Inasmuch as this seat appears to be deserved for me, I take it nobody would object if I sit down. - Of course, nobody objects at all. (laughs) - My husband, this is Dr. Walter Bertram, the bridegroom. - Good evening. - The bride just stepped out. She should be back in a minute now. - Her in-laws. - Good evening, good evening, good evening. Judge Baumgartner, I just happened to mention your name to the police commissioner, and I don't mind telling you. He maintains a very high opinion of you. - Oh really? - Where'd she go? - Who do you want? - That little slut. She was here a minute ago, and you can fork over 150 smackers! Or I'm calling the cops! I'm game for a good joke anytime, I can take it! But I'm a sensitive guy, and I don't like my feelings hurt! One more thing. You can have these back. - Huh? (keys jangle) Oh? I'll be right back. - Do you know that this is a federal district magistrate? - Waiter, a brandy. - Oh, don't worry, we'll take care of the clown. Here. We'll conk him over the head with a flower pot. - What about Daddy? - I thought you told your old man the whole story ages ago? - I'm not worried about my reputation. I've lost that for good. It's Daddy's career. - Isn't federal district magistrate enough career for you? - Rosy, Rosy! - What are you doing? - Come out of there at once! - The ladies room! - I know that. Rosy, come out of here at once or I'll come in after you! Rosy, did you hear what I said? You must come out of here at once! - Say something for goodness sake! Go on! (Inge screams) - It's not half as bad as you think it is. The truth is, I relieved 17 nasty creatures of some of their money. - How many did you say? - 20, if you're going to be so pedantic about it. But the only thing they got from me was two phony keys and a very cheap key ring. Now you know the whole story, and I never wanna see you again! - Oh. - Do you know that this is a federal district magistrate? - Waiter, a brandy. (upbeat jazz music) - You know, darling, I... (upbeat jazz music continues) (gentleman whimpers) Gooey! (balloons rustle) (laughs) There you are. Well, what do you think?
