I speak English. You speak English? I must talk fast. There are things in this village you do not know about. They cannot get away with this... these devils. Did anybody see you? Forgive them. They have been through so much. Are they yours? They are daughters of my niece. Soraya. I am Zahra. Zahra. Zahra, are you crazy? They think so. And after this, and a bone... and inviting a stranger into your home... I'm inclined to agree. Sit, please. I will give you some tea... then you decide who is crazy, me or them. a smoke? Ah... the Ayatollahs have banned women from smoking. Today I am old... a hundred years older than yesterday. But I know right from wrong. What happened here yesterday was wrong. Yesterday. The devil himself visited this town... and Allah the merciful know it. God willing, you will know it too. Start your machine. Voices of women do not matter in here. I want you to take my voice with you. Why should I listen to you if, as you say... the voices of women no longer matter anywhere in this country. Hear my story first. You will know why you should listen. There are men in this town who are wild dogs. Their hunt began not long ago with Soraya's husband... Ali.
