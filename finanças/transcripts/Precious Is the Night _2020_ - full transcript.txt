I will get her. Madam, telephone! Hello? How do I describe my fear? I actually have the same face as a dead man from years ago. Last year, I bought a stack of old articles from a junkshop. Unwanted copies thrown out by the local newspaper. In one of the pictures, I saw my face. It sent shivers down my spine. It was a murder case. Two bodies. One male and one female. Obviously, I am not him, yet we look very much alike. He was a family doctor. Dr. Tan. The lady was somebody's mistress. A former second-rate starlet. The Cause of the Victim's Death Is Still Unknown Whereabouts of the Family Doctor Remain a Mystery The incident occurred in 1969. It caused a massive commotion when it was first reported. Eventually, like all other news, it was quickly forgotten by the public. As for this novel that I'm working on, it is practically putting my fears into writing. Woman falls to her death at her home on Wilkinson Road Woman believed to have been given regular injections of sedatives Heavy bleeding from blunt force injury No witnesses on the scene Wealthy Woman Found Dead at Midnight in Her Home Serious Head Trauma With Bleeding From the Mouth Hair Drug Test Was Positive Woman Believed to Have Fallen to Her Death With a Fatal Injury to Her Head Life is a show An endless show Sometimes it's sad Sometimes glad The actors are special and unusual Special and unusual Together we cry Together we laugh As we become one We are happy and sad And get carried away and all Get carried away and all But if you compete or compare To see who is better and mightier You'll find the actor can't compare To the true fans watching the show Cha, cha, cha, ay, ya, ya Life is a show An endless show... Hello to our listeners out there. What a beautiful morning! How time flies! 1969 will have slipped by in the blink of an eye. This year, many things have happened in this country. The first set of simplified Chinese characters was published, which has given us a chance to revisit Mandarin. Also, this year marked the launch of the Grand Lottery, with a top prize of up to 400,000 dollars. It gives everyone the opportunity to have their dream come true. Sadly, the May 13th race riot was a regretful moment. No matter if it is good or bad, everything will eventually pass. Perhaps this is what life is. The stage looks to life, yet life is just a stage. Life might seem like an exciting play, full of twists and turns, but isn't it meaningless? Are you new here? Do you know who I am? I have no idea. Do you know any of my rules? No, I don't. At least you know why you are here, right? I'm here to earn money. Where is your hometown? Shunde. Which village? Huo Village, Xingtan Town. Come. "Kneel down"? Look up. What is your name? Liang Bao Cui. Madam! Bao Cui. I'm sorry. Is she clean? Yes, Madam. I have already checked her. Okay. What took you so long? Where have you been? Come here! "But if I did not come, if I could not see you, at least I would have gazed long on all that surrounds you. At night, every night, I arose, I came hither, I watched your house, its glimmering in the moon, the trees in the garden swaying before your window, and through the window-panes in the darkness, a shining gleam of the little lamp. You never knew that I was so near you, yet so far from you. It eddied to-and-fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which suffused her soul." Marvelous! The great French author Flaubert wrote this masterpiece at such a young age of 36. Reading a classic was just foreplay. She knew that the handsome doctor would do much more to satisfy her lonely soul.

It is a mental illness. She cries at night often. I could hear it from upstairs. It is obvious that she is really unhappy living here. Where is Master then? Master? He lives in another home. Your medicine, Madam. It is Master's order. Its plot, in brief, is that Madame Bovary, feeling tired of her dull, passionless life, committed adultery and was scheming to run away with her lover, without success. Finally, devastated by her lover's betrayal, with all hope gone, she poisoned herself to death by swallowing arsenic. At last, a tragic end. Running away in secret? How exciting! Running away sounds too capricious to me. Why not say "traveling far, flying high"? Isn't that more romantic? "Traveling far, flying high"? How to travel? How to fly? In fact, I've been thinking that we can go and live elsewhere. Be it Thailand or Vietnam. Any place will do. A place where people would not recognize me. Are you mad? If we get caught, then... Suddenly you remind me of the term, "suicide pact." You can't equate "secret runaway" with "committing suicide." They are totally unrelated. Therefore, in my opinion, lovers who dare to commit suicide pacts are something I greatly admire. They are lovers in the highest sense. My British gentleman, pardon my asking, how do you say "traveling far, flying high" in English? "What was in the injections?" She asked. "You're feeling good, correct?" "Then that is all you need to know," Dr. Tan replied. Without a doubt, it was the medication that Madam Ku was addicted to. Dr. Tan never revealed that he added the illicit drug amphetamines to the dose. Who are you? My name is Bao Cui. I'm new here. And you? Me? I am Dr. Tan, a doctor. Begin. "For I am the first and the last." "I am the honored and the scorned." "I am the harlot and the holy one." "I am the wife and the virgin." "I am the mother and the daughter." "I am the members of my mother." "I am the barren one and the one with many children." "I am she, whose marriage is multiple, and I have not taken a husband." "I am she, who is weak, and I am well in pleasure of place. I am the mother of my father, and the sister of my husband." "I am knowledge and ignorance." "I am shame and boldness. - I am foolish and I am wise." - "I am foolish and I am wise." A Salon was a gathering of the literati of the day in the home of a gracious and often wealthy host. The mark of a good host would depend on the status of his guests. Good day, Madam. Regarding dining etiquette, back to basics, what matters the most is one's manner of sitting. As the Chinese saying goes, "Sit as one should sit." Where should you place your two hands? Clench them softly, and place them on the edge of the table. By doing so, your back will straighten naturally, and your upper body will be poised forward. I have been told that the training in the British royal family for Queen Elizabeth was so rigorous that at whatever disturbance behind her, she would not be started or distracted. Only when you can attain this level of composure, can you be considered a true lady. "Besides, I shall want a trunk. Not too heavy. Something handy." Madam Ku said. RUN AWAY Certainly. Yes. I can. I will do it right away. She knew that someone would take action, and when it would take place. She knew exactly what to do at that moment, and what she stood to gain after doing it. It occurred to me that Madam Ku Yang shared many similarities with Flaubert's 19th century Madame Bovary. They were both desperately willing to sacrifice their nubile bodies and affections in pursuit of material comforts and status. Listen. Rain accompanied by thunder. I am afraid that something might go wrong tonight. Investigations on the Murder Case at Stalemate Two Maids Possibly Implicated Dear Dr. Tan, I've been having premonitions of my death. The older Madam hates me. My English tutor is envious of everything that I have. My etiquette instructor cannot disguise her scorn for me. Even my two maids are constantly scheming against me. The world is such a complicated place to live in. If my destiny says so, I have no regrets. However, I must refuse a death of unclear circumstances. Listen, I will be gone for a while. But I will be back soon. Do not say anything to anyone. And tell Madam that it is time. She will understand. Madam, telephone! Hello? A telephone call in the late of the night? What would Dr. Tan do? Keep waiting? Look. A full moon accompanied by lightning. It makes no sense. Of course it doesn't make sense. The world has already turned upside down. What a cheeky riposte! You actors are always unmatched. Tell me. Who was the person that you were to meet tonight? Your dealings are open secrets to us now. Listen, Ku Yang. The life that you live accommodated with a luxurious wardrobe, an English tutor, an etiquette instructor, and two serving maids, is what a socialite in high society can ever hope to have. Do you not feel content? My heart is like a locked room in desperate need of a key. Pardon me? Another clich√© from one of your movies? You feel imprisoned, don't you? Wasn't this what you wanted? Now you plan to run away with your lover? Do you think you are in a movie? Do you still remember where your hometown is? Certainly. Huo Village, Xingtan Town in Shunde. You are really something. From a showgirl, you jumped into bed with my husband, to become a mistress. I have worked my way up to where I am today. You worked your way up? I am the one who gave in to you. Listen. If it wasn't because I was barren and Master wanted you to produce a son, I wouldn't have put up with you. Somehow, you have overstepped yourself without a bit of respect for me, the legal wife. Look into my eyes! What's not yours will never be yours. Don't you dare to dream beyond your means. Otherwise, I shall curse you to death. "Curse me to death"? Shut up! How dare you? Did you want to abscond with my money? No way! International Flight Schedule Singapore to Bangkok 6:20 a.m., 10:20 a.m., 11:40 a.m., 2:15 p.m. Singapore to Palembang Baggage Allowance 15 kg, 30 kg, 30 kg I wonder how you will get rid of this evil thing? You are such a shameless woman. There is nothing you wouldn't dare to do. I hope you understand this. It has always been easy to hate and destroy. To build and to cherish is much more difficult. We could have been at peace with each other. Why must you speak English? You are sick. You are terribly sick. Madam! Bao Cui! Don't go down! Madam! Ku Yang, Hometown: Guangdong Birthdate: November 14th Height: 5 ft 6 in Weight: 116 lbs Hobby: Reviewing Yue opera Recent work: Pearl Phoenix If these suspects and specters stepped out of my imagination, what would they say? I once visited a temple to seek my fortune. I drew a divination lot that read, "The heart wants to fly, but its wings are paper-thin. Never pursue righteousness, and your life will be firmly grounded." I have to forget my dreams, and live my entire life as someone's mistress, tolerating harsh conditions. There's no need to become a legitimate wife. Have you ever noticed her hooked nose? There's an old Chinese saying, "A nose shaped like the beak of an eagle is sure to peck through a person's heart." Her face was a bad omen that would cause ruin to her husband. I am glad she is dead. Well, she is just a peasant. Ruby? I'm not interested in jewelry. I'm only interested in... A woman's own character shapes her fortune. Me? How can I just live my whole life as a lowly maid? I am not only good at singing, but also good at acting. Acting naive is my special skill. I don't have the means to run away with her. I am only a poor doctor. Her strong emotion makes me feel suffocated and makes me terrified. I just want to run away. It was disclosed by a police insider that the mess Dr. Tan found himself in was no small matter. He was insinuating that the case was not what it seemed. You have the passport? Yes. You are forgetting nothing? No. Are you sure? Certainly. Are you afraid? If you did nothing wrong, why would you be afraid? Don't you feel sorry for her? Well, I couldn't care less. How can you be so cruel? Sooner or later, we all die. Tell me, do you have any qualms about her? Bixia, don't you pray to Guanyin? Like a dream, a phantom A drop of dew, a flash of lightning Do not answer a question with another question! Master. No, Master. No, Master! Please! I said no! Why are you here? I have no idea. To earn money. You can earn money elsewhere. I really don't understand why you are here. Go to hell! I have no idea. - You know it! - No, I don't. - You know it! - No, I don't. You know it! Human affairs are nothing but superficial. The birds that fly over us will shed their feathers, the people that walk past us will shed their skin. And ants crave the sweetness of blood. Alas, these simple truths are unavoidable. I'm playing a role in the story I'm writing. I actually feel that I'm a part of the characters. I live and breathe with them. Poor creature! Two Maids' Involvement In the Murder Was Dismissed After Investigations The Whereabouts of Dr. Tan, the Family Doctor, Is a Mystery There was only one consequence of Dr. Tan's deed and manner. The bottom had fallen out of his world. Then, the tragic photos printed on the wide-spread Nanyang Shi Pau in 1969 might as well be his only redemption. Isn't it? Face Damaged Beyond Recognition Man Found Dead With Severe Gunshot Wound in a White Sports Car Face Damaged Beyond Recognition A Death So Tragic That One Cannot Bear to Look South-wind kisses softly the face The fragrance of flowers lingers in the air South-wind kisses softly the face The star-light dims, moonshine fades We embrace in a kiss That words can't express We embrace in a kiss That speaks from the depths of my heart No matter what comes tomorrow Tomorrow is goodbye Hold on to the night Cherish this precious night Say farewell to our love Soon the sun will rise in the East Say farewell to our love We'll meet again in our dreams No matter what comes tomorrow Tomorrow is goodbye Hold on to the night Cherish this precious night Say farewell to our love Soon the sun will rise in the East Say farewell to our love We'll meet again in our dreams You were just listening to "This Precious Night" by Tsui Ping. That was the last number of "Night of Golden Hit Songs." We are reaching the end of tonight's program. Here, I would like to wish everyone sweet dreams. And may you achieve anything your heart desires.
