It's from the company that came to take photos today He went to see you to greet you I'm going to start - I'll start I'm sorry I didn't tell you anything about the filming. I want to make this house a perfect gesture It's not bad to keep it in a video It's ok After all, you're administering the house But I don't get along with that guy named Sakurai This is very rare This is unusual in Youi-chan I don't even want to talk about people who hate Redo Curse, redo There is no progress Did you drink? I was all night planning business. Have you taken your work home again? You know I have to transfer I think it is irresponsible to get rid of the job with you That's true When you finish the job, take a vacation Yasuda-san - Yes You do too much, your body will collapse In fact, I'm not comfortable lately. You should get out early Your face looks really bad Yesterday was a day off and you were filming I can't do that This is the pain of intermediate administration Don't worry Inoue This position will be delivered to you one day Better forget it Oh, hell Again I want to vomit You smell of sweat That's not true If you're sweating, better go home to eat something Take-San really want to eat out No I'm sorry Are you ok? Sakurai-san Hello Are you ok? Just... a little uncomfortable Ok Sometimes Used to be abandoned by the world How did you know I was drawing flowers? Alright, hold on.

I was looking for a sudden break around here. There are plenty of empty rooms anyway The way you talk really irritates people You look a lot better Very well It's true I thank you very much You're always drawing flowers Do you like to paint? Sakurai-san You're stepping on the flower bed That was close I didn't stepped on the flowers, did I? What happened? Nothing I'm sorry to let you take care of me I thank you again That... What happens? Nothing This is the first time I see Youi-chan smile Look at this guy It's in Minagawa's house that we took pictures before Should I say that he owns the house or the young master? Did not you go to say hello to some guy Sakurai-san? He was painting in his room Why would a student be their former owner? When was this taken? The photographer said that the boy was very cute I took one Took What flower was that? When you can't draw something you want to paint Just start painting like that After that the color overlap, The image will emerge slowly. That is your technique, right? Yosuke, please tell us What do you do? I want to know about your childhood My father was like a king He was loved by all I've never seen my father without anyone around I want to tell you that Yosuke and Ayako Due to an accident... Have you ever heard of that? Yosuke-san died a few days ago It's not possible Police suspect he left everything to Youichi and then he committed suicide Really? Ayako-san's condition is out of control Maybe the two wanted to commit suicide together What are you painting? I feel like you always do the same painting I can't decipher the abstract paintings What are you painting? This time it's a chore? I'm a painter too, you know that? You must be Fujimoto You know it We are in the same class What occurs? It's nothing I'm in the middle, aren't you going to keep drawing? Is it stupid to stay with someone like me? If it's annoying, so you better go You like to paint a lot, right? Do you like to paint? I want to see when you paint Your hand It's cold You're always drawing flowers Minaga Did you forget that I'm here? Forget it You are really funny Brother! Brother! Do you live here?

Thank you for taking care of my Go eat with everyone I'm going Please don't go Rest and sit with us, will you? It's difficult to come here But someone else gave it to you The one who brought you back here was Yoshitomi-san So better to share it between the two Minaga I also plan to live by this area Is there any available room for rent? There are 5 pieces, all are different For you What is this? What kind of cake is this? I'm going to start I hate sweet, but this once I will eat just a piece Minaga, do you hate sweet?

Soon I will be a good friend This guy does not speak Oh, then am I... I'm sorry I have to go back Are you going to return? Good bye See you later Work hard I'm going to eat this I will accompany it This is also delicious This I mentioned to you on chat It is so strange that Youichi can speak with other people That's what I thought But it seems that you have friends That kind of makes a moment... Youichi has always been so with the people Make deaf ears Is not interested in anyone I've never seen him smile But he... Sakurai-san, it seems that you are special to him Just come with me up to here Good bye, thank you I felt Youichi likes you, Sakurai-San. Sakurai-san, I feel that he is willing to take the initiative to approach you What do you mean? Youichi? What happened Youichi? I will accompany him I will accompany Sakurai-san It's ok Please I said, where is Minagawa? I think that, Youi-chan is not interested in you Youi-chan, did he tell you? He's a guy who does not open his heart to people so easily Still, I'm interested enough to hear you say that He said that you were careful Did he tell you that I like the kind of guys that are on the bad track? I want to know everything about him What do you do when I do not know where you are? I want to know in what kind of place he lives and with whom. Leaves have fallen on your head. Where are they? Here and here and here also I have removed it ¿Sakurai-san, can I go to your house? I can't go to your house? The place is small I guess it's not bigger than your house, right? Really? This is the first time I go to someone else's house First time? There's a lot to talk about This is terrible I can't keep her alive. Although I like flowers Interest is momentary Enthusiasm fades very quickly You're so irresponsible It's ok, sit down. I'm getting something to drink. Should I have said something better? Smells good You scared me Sit there Sakurai-san, does your coffee start with the ground grains? What about your house? Take-san is going to go drink Can't you have some coffee? Not that I can't, I just don't drink it What happens? Nothing I think it's good to start from scratch Besides I'm used I don't hate it Can I try? No, it's in the clockwise direction It's ok For you Thank you I didn't expect it to be so tasty "I didn't expect ", you have nothing to say Sakurai-san, you usually... what do you do after work? I drink beer while watching TV I'm late for house, but very often I don't usually sleep, and I work at home Really? Are you happy talking about this? I'm happy Because I can get to know you better By the way, are you going to rent a room? It's called Fujimoto Who knows, he's just an acquaintance of the university I don't know so much to he You still don't know him, he just looks at you... Sakurai-san; you, do you have a good relationship with Take-san? What happens with he? He said he was going to take you Why when I realize that you were going to go, I want to stay with you longer? You're going to dinner, Youichi? It's the first time you call me by my name It's because everyone calls you Minagawa Youichi You don't like? I'm very happy Something like this feeling It's ok, thank you Do you have any special talents? Well... although it is not related to cosmetics I'm good at wrestling Can I ask someone to practice? Egawa, come on Minister, please go Me, me? Could please Really? I'll go Well, what am I supposed to do? Please step forward - Here? It's ok - Good, so Don't be offended by this What's going on? The key is quite powerful It's very powerful, right? That's awesome The lord is not doing well Inoue, how old are they? 19 years, the right 17 years Is almost like Youichi What? Nothing How old are you? 28 years Would you be with a 19 year old? For example, someone of that age I think that it would not last much Yes, it's true I can't control my feelings more What? Nothing Why do I always think about him? Hello? Hello Sakurai-san, I'm Shouta For here please Suddenly you called me, what happened? I think Youi-chan has a clear feeling to you This is incredible Do you know Minagawa Yosuke? A very famous painter I know By the way, Minagawa Yes, the father of Youi-chan When we were small, her parents died in an accident Yosuke-san was a very good man He had many friends Probably that's why Youi-chan has a terrible and invisible pressure Like Yoshitomi-san Our brothers are concerned about he I only heard the words of my parents, that's why I live here. Sakurai-san Come to our house more often please I would be very happy if you're there, Sakurai-san Youi-chan would think the same What can I say? I'm going to remove this It's time to return Isn't you Sakurai-san? Long time no see ^.^ Yes To Shouta forgot this, I came to deliver it Fair I also wanted to talk to you I heard that Youichi went to your house Yes What did you say to him? I didn't say anything Then, why are you upset? I'm not upset Speaking of Youichi Have you ever heard of the Minagawa family? No Do you know that there are very wealthy people who are landowners? This is the Minagawa house I'm here because of Yosuke I just manage the property and Lands here I was wondering if you are the manager who lives here No That's my affair, so let's not talk about this Youichi, the guy Many things happened after the death of their parents Suddenly he inherited a family and a house As the saying goes, rich in mountains have distant relatives And I know that there have been many problems With this type of things are with which it should not deal with Youichi Then, he came to me and said: Rent this house like my father did Honestly, I'm happy I went to college with his father It was a very good relationship I am happy to see you again However, I have never seen the emergence of the true Youichi It is only a 19 years old boy Without friends and without girlfriend Some people in my environment I was told once that he imitates the father's paintings Sometimes I wonder if it has something else that really want to do I think that to Youichi really likes paint He is always happy when he paints He likes to paint Youichi is a very nice guy Sakurai-san Can you take a look at the room of Youichi? I'll take care of giving this to Shouta In the paintings of my father I saw a picture that shook my heart A well acclaimed image, that reflects the world Even if there is a relationship, no matter how much I look like my father, I can not paint like him Sakurai-san What are you doing here? I wanted to talk with you I'm very happy Because I wanted to talk to you too You are still painting that flower Is it a project? No It is just an elegant painting That's all Let me see it, please I was very happy to see how you painted It's ok What... Nothing Before I planted flowers with my mother How was your mother? I do not remember very clearly I only planted flowers once Probably wasn't interested in my I don't think so My mother also died early I don't know much about my mother either just like you Always one thing has bothered me since I was a child So far, it has only been in my heart Although I heard that my parents died in a car accident Maybe they left me to be able to kill myself The seeds in the meter of my mother Where I left it? They are in the drawer of my father Not do they bloom? No But, there are still seeds It has been a long time, they should not bloom again Now we are going to see him They could bloom Good The soil is very hard It will not germinate Don't say that It's the season of flowers Good You will not be able to take care of him, even if it arises This time I will do it Although unreliable, anything related to Sakurai-san, any that sean details, facial expressions, remember everything They never made me feel or think about this What? Hey! What's wrong, Youichi? Sakurai-san Youichi Hey, Minagawa It's cold! It's cold! Stop now! I told you not to do that! Don't do that! That guy really dislike me Happiness is the most important Do I look happy? But Youichi appears very calm Use this towel - Thank you Sakurai-san, you're really infant You'll be serious again It's not true Today the sky is very bright I want, better not... What happened? So suddenly... I just thought you were very cute and direct Unconsciously... This sort of thing Can you do what you want? As you can see, there is no one here Can no one do it? I don't know It's ok, it's ok. Let's go back It hurts Close your eyes Yasuda, can you get the customer number? No problem This was the best location for the scene Sakurai, let me tell you something The President of the Osaka Branch is here You'll have to take care of you for the coming year Behave (AD-NATION Co.Ltd Branch of Osaka of the new Department of Business of Division's Innovation of the Proposal for Business) Minagawa You haven't been to University lately, so I've come to collect you You must deliver the project, so everything will be alright Put that here Let's go Go Go, go Minagawa What happens? Sakurai-san has been in your house lately? No He has not been there since the last time he got wet in the yard? No, he didn't return It seems that it is not serious Because it's really a heterosexual type Effectively When I talk of Sakurai-san your eyes get bigger I also want you to look at me with the same eyes I Always care about you You don't seem to put anyone in your eyes I also know that women don't interest you But it seems that you are different with Sakurai-san Minaga-san Do you know that you watching Sakurai-San with a very special look? If I were Sakurai-san, for the way you look at him, I'd be forced to have you around How does Sakurai-san to turn your back? Insurance is too busy to see you That is a lot, don't you think? But if you out with me, don't you think it would be better? What way would be best? Let me think In the first place, I can pick you up every day as I did today and wait to go home together We can always be together You know, you want to be different from Sakurai-san We are of the same age There will be no generation gap That is important still And also Hey, Minaga Can you really take me seriously? I like you You can accept men You are not surprised Me too If it's you, I can always bear it Hurts Why? I'm sorry Get out of here Oh, I'm sorry Minagawa, I... I I'm not angry I know It's not good That is strange, why you are drinking coffee? You're not feeling well? You're a little weird Would you like another cup? No necessary I want to eat cake No problem I will make one for you But in exchange, you should cheer up No, it's not so The cake that refers to Youi-chan is for Sakurai-san Yoshitomi-san I'd like to ask you something Okay, I'll make sure they do it It's ok, please Good bye Sakurai-san Is there something you want to forget? I say this because when you work, you usually do not think of anything else Then please check this Sorry to bother you at work. Do you have time to find us? Iwasaki Takeo Sorry to bother you at work. Never mind You haven't been home lately... In fact, I'm going to transfer me Well, to be accurate, everything is already fixed When I was in that house I forgot it The working pressure it made me remember and feel happy Does Youichi know about this? I think I should tell him You arrive just in time But yesterday Youichi asked Yoshitomi-san for his contact information, Sakurai-san I feel not having your consent After consulting with Yoshitomi-san, I said to Youichi to, also I want to give you the number of Youichi I'm sick of this continue Can you accept it? This is the first time that Youichi... Can you tell me really what you want from Youichi? Hello? I'm Youichi I want to see you You spoke with Yoshitomi-san? I sent him an email He said you had to prepare my dinner Not said anything else? No Yoshitomi-san also said "it's ok" Yoshitomi-san is a good man He has always been good I always trust him All people told me to see my world around, since only I am interested in the painting Until I met you, Sakurai-san Until I met you, Sakurai-san I don't even recognize me Why now don't you come to my house? Only plants the flowers, and then you do not care? You said it before You're not good at gardening Always try to keep them alive But the enthusiasm fades very quickly You know you well Also because I'm an adult You're so astute At this moment, I am an adult Are you an adult? I'm twice as old as you What's wrong with that? Tú, You still don'tt have your own way to go in the future and I can't return You... - I can't come to your house, Sakurai-san? Can't I be with you? In compared to Fujimoto He can look at things from the same perspective that you But you and me... - Sakurai-san Sakurai-san I... Youichi I'm sorry Why do you ask me for forgiveness? You're a child You're 19 years old, he is uncomfortable Didn't you understand what it meant to be with me? Even if this is not well, you have seen that I am beginning to draw a flower You're always on my mind Youichi I have been avoiding your reasons for doing this, but now there are reasons to do it You know what mean me, right? I get it Very clearly Sakurai-san Work hard - Work hard Your plan is ending, isn't it? Yes, all that remains is to visit clients That's all Minister, I would like to know how long is going to take the transfer According to the case, about three years Three years? Minagawa Fujimoto Have you heard? What? I heard that Sakurai-San will be transferred to Osaka Part-time work as a model I heard from one of Sakurai-san's clients Minagawa You haven't said it yet. Can I stay here? I have no problem with that If Yoshitomi-San agrees Yoshitomi-san How should I tell him? Now I live here They take care of me That's a good thing Tell me Sakurai-san, are you going to transfer to Osaka? That news is very good I was going to say it myself Youichi Sakurai-san is telling the truth I also found out Sakurai-san himself was going to tell you I've eaten well I also ate well Youichi Why are you chasing him now? Are you the only one? Why are you chasing Youichi? Because I'm honest with Minagawa And you? How did you look at Minagawa? You know how he feels about you, right? You know these emotions are more complicated, right? Then tell him, leave him and go I know I know what I have to do. I know what's going on between Minagawa and you Even so, I didn't give up It's the first time I've had this kind of feeling What's that feeling? Fujimoto, I always thought you were interested in Youi-chan I didn't know you were interested in Sakurai-san Wait, wait, wait, wait You have misunderstood You're bothering this white-eyed wolf Sakurai-san, and you? You're an adult after all Fix the Fujimoto disaster And then get him out of here I told you... Listen to me! Because I'm an adult, I want to give you the perfect explanation For Youichi... Sakurai-san Youichi What are you thinking? Do you have any ideas? I'm asking you if you really want to be with me or not! I'm here to talk about that But if you've already decided to go to Osaka Yes, it's fixed Things are done and we can not do anything about it. I'm only going to Osaka for three years Three years When were you going to be ready to tell me you were going to leave me for three years? Today What would you do if I had a complaint? - Hey, understand me - Understand you? I'm in a critical period of my career Of course, you're also important. Even though? Youichi, if you were a girl, I probably wouldn't be so tangled up about this I would not hesitate to ask you to wait for me I could even marry you I would also ask you to please come with me But you're a boy So I can't do this What are you saying? What are you asking? You knew this was going to happen, It's not true? It's not true? Do what you want until the end After all, I'm new to this, right Sakurai? Though now I can understand it all So, can you come with me? I'm not going Of course I'm not going to go What we're looking for is different I'm not going with someone you can't trust. You're just thinking about the job. Or the perfect couple. I know I'm not done yet Where are you going? I'll give you time to think You're so cunning Sakurai-san you're a shameless What day is it? I can't draw anything Clearly, there's something I want to draw But it can't take shape Youi-chan You're very closed We are all very concerned Youi-chan you should think of yourself And you really like painting? Didn't you draw because Yosuke-san was a painter? The house is destined to inherit also the mantle of the father Youi-chan It's like you live in the place of Yosuke-san Sometimes I regret to paint But dad has always been in my heart But I I've always hated my father's paintings When I met Sakurai-san I knew I was painting flowers He said I looked very happy when I was painting I realized that Gracias a Sakurai-San I became the real me Youi-chan Hey, Minagawa! Sakurai-san is going to Osaka You can try me again Sorry Are you out of my reach? Even if I'm serious? Clearly you're more important to me than for Sakurai-san... I'm sincere with you Isn't that enough? It has nothing to do with Sakurai-san I don't want to That's all I feel like I've changed a lot since you started liking me You know, I have no boring idea... Ya que me gustas Estoy muy feliz todos los dias That feeling, it's ok I don't hate you Maybe I like you But this kind of like It's not the same as love for Sakurai-san I really like Sakurai-san Also I know Because I'm so stupid I hope you have a good relationship with Sakurai-san I'm so idiot Let me see it well, please Sakurai-san has always waited patiently for me They have a good price the moments where I'm angry and confused Because every time that I touched me I felt restless and undecided And then my brain was left blank If I'm the same as before, I will not recognize myself I will be surprised I have to see Youichi Youichi Even though you said you gave me time to think about it I still don't know what to do I'm sorry I'm sorry, I... I ran away I left you all decisions and choices I'm so sorry You really are very cunning, Sakurai-san I was going to apologize first. Why will you would apologize first? Because I wanted to do it No matter what happens, I like you so much Even if you always say hurtful things Youichi, I like you Even though you're too much for me, we'll be the perfect couple Have you finished painting? Still no I'm trying to paint the flowers I planted with my mother You can't draw it, right? After all, it is a flower that cannot bloom Youichi About your parents I heard Yoshitomi say it Both died in an accident Your parents love you very much It's not enough? What kind of seed is this? Hibiscus My favorite flower Because it's equal to your name Make sure it blooms with you this time Weren't you going to Osaka? I'll be back often Flowers should be watered every day I'll call you every day So, please take, care of her You're so capricious, really. But, wow Youichi, are you crying? I'm not crying Sakurai-san This flower is about to bloom Definitely this time it's going to blossom We must make it flourish
