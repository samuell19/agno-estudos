Today is the first of July, the start of the summer holidays. Around midnight, the big rush of the holiday makers has started. They'll walk straight into our arms... ...but in doing so they will drive over our women and children. They'll mock us, sergeant. They'll recognize us from afar. - Take off your uniforms. Oh no, not like with those nudists. Fougasse, stop that. No, sergeant, not that again. - Stop it. The prefect orders police action in civilian clothes in the whole department. We have to be ready in two hours. Cruchot, your instructions. You can go. To the right. Forward, march. Cruchot. Tact, effectiveness, but, above all, no hair-splitting. One will cross the yellow line sooner or later. Alright. There's the first victim. Look, he's going to do it. I missed him. Missed him. Hello, Cherub to Blue Chicken. Reply. Hello? Cherub to Blue Chicken. Blue Chicken is listening. Stop the red one. Stop him. Make sure you get him. He's going to lose something. Force him into the curb. - Don't intervene right away. Call the colleagues in uniform. - That thing is going to fly off. An order is an order. - Ok, then. Hello? Crocodile here... Blue Chicken, Crocodile here... Stay on the road. Hello? Crocodile here... Tricart. Berlicot... It's too early for siesta. Get up. And smile. No mercy. Can you take us to the next village? Get in the back. And don't damage the cargo. Swedish girls. - Nice, what? Are you Swedish girls? Blue Chicken? Cherub here. I'm at the turn of the old mill. The bastards. Fougasse, Merlot. What's happening? Thanks. Very nice of you. Cherub to Blue Chicken. Reply. Sixteen interventions. One call from Caligula. Only one? Cherub to Caligula. Reply. Come in, reply, Caligula. Tricart, Berlicot, what are you doing? Darling, I love you. I adore you. Yes. Vive la France. - I love champagne. Who are you, madam? Well, congratulations. You'll pay for that. Tricart, Berlicot... Shut up. Cherub to Caligula. You just wait. Cherub to Caligula. Shut up. I'll get the police, just wait. No, there. There. Where's my transmitter? - No, there. suspension of driving licenses Prefect, sir... Six months of suspension. Does everybody agree? I know you from somewhere. Sergeant Cruchot from Saint-Tropez. A dynamic corps, commander. Keep your speed under control. Get out of here. Would you mind pushing a bit? You think I'm crazy? Come on, start it. I'll check the engine. - It's in the back. What could it be? - The distributor, of course. Right, fixed. My gloves. You'll pay for this. I was going to let you get away with it, but now... Get lost. Get lost. The corps commander, please. - I'm listening. Jos?pha Lefran?ois. My husband was a colonel with the gendarmerie of Lower Normandy. I lost him. Twelve years ago. My slightly belated, but sincere condolences, madam. Sergeant J?r?me Gerber. At your service, madam. Would you please step into my office? Please, sit down. - Thank you. How can I be of service? - Well, you see... I rented a villa that's way too big. Well, you see, my parents. They tried to make me feel less lonely. You should relax a bit. That's what my friend Laurence says, the daughter of general Rochemont. But all alone in that big house, I sometimes feel so scared for no reason. But you shouldn't. - I'm oversensitive. I told Liliane Fouchard, the daughter of the State Secretary... Everybody is afraid sometimes, I said, even the general. De Rochemont? - No, Charles. At your service, madam. Madam, can I offer you a glass of port and something to eat? Please. - One moment, please. Ok, pretty one, I've got you now. Who are you? - Father Christmas. With fines for you. And there is more. What's gotten into you? - You're a danger on the road. You should be in a straitjacket. Shut up. You don't know who you're talking to. - To a mad woman. Madame Lefran?ois, widow of the colonel of Lower Normandy... ...and friend of general De Rochemont... ...of State Secretary Fouchard... ...and of someone who I shall not name. Is she still here? I'm peeing. I'm peeing... Madam... - I speed, that's true. But I don't commit serious felonies. - Absolutely no serious felonies. Let's forget all about it. - Thank you. I'm Jos?pha. - I'm Ludovic. I'm Jos?pha. - I'm Ludovic. And I'm Gerber. Excuse him. My husband looked like you, Mr. Cruchot. Hard, without mercy, but such a good character. In short, a man. You owe me many apologies, Mr. Cruchot. Tea at my place, tomorrow at 5 pm? Madam... What kind of a circus is this? I don't know, sergeant. - You're full of static electricity. You think? What is that? Here, kiss my hand. Kiss it. That's an order. The other one. No, the other one. Nothing's happening. Strange. But then... - Then it's the love of a lifetime. Daddy, can I go to the movies? - Yes. Here's some money. Madam... - Yes, take the day off. What a beautiful rose. My apologies for yesterday. - It's me who should apologize. I'll drive more carefully from now on. I'm a widower too. Since the birth of my daughter. You have a daughter? Here with you? - Yes, here. How old is she? She's still very young. I love little children. A cup of tea? One lump? Two lumps? Hold this for a moment. Whose idea is this? What? Fougasse, look at me. Not there, here. Four days of sweeping. - Not me again. Oh yes. And now dismissed. The broom closet is that way. Go on. You're a born leader. We have to consider your promotion. What is it? - A letter for you, chief. You'll be happy. It wasn't me who opened it, chief. What? Unbelievable. You'd better hope it's good news. - It is good news. You can go now, Berlicot. A shame our meeting was so short. I feel like dancing. How is that dancing course at the Place des Lys? No idea. Why? - Just wondering. For fun. Do you want to learn to dance? - Why would I? And what if I did? Then why do you ask? - Stop bugging me. Don't get angry. - I'm just asking a question. Wow, you're in a bad mood. - And what about you? Sir... Come on, I'll show you. Don't forget the other foot. One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four... Turn around. No exit. Wait, there. Are you also hiding from the police? I'd like to beat up a cop one day. Wouldn't you? Ok, let's get them. Do you want the big one or the small one? - The small one. No, I'll take him. So which one? Come on. Let's attack. Take him away. I'll get you for this. Why do you keep following him? I'm afraid I'll have a stepmother soon. What's he doing? Nicole, look after your father. I'm worried about his private life. I'm keeping an eye on him. Yes, I'm worried. Daddy, are you coming to the movies tonight? I can't. - You can't? Why not? I've got a lot of paperwork to do. You work too hard. Remember your age. What? I've never felt this young. You have a grown daughter who worries about you. Worries? Why? - Think about that one. Sorry, I have to go. There, that's her car. - Not exactly down and out. Try not to be noticed. Not bad, your father's fianc?e. - Should we try to steal her away from him? It's going well, isn't it? - Great. I was afraid you couldn't dance. Have you ever thought about remarrying? ...three, four. Very often. - Like this. No. What are they saying to each other? I'd like to get to know your little daughter. She's rather shy. Come, let's dance. - I don't know the cha-cha-cha. Just improvise then. She goes to bed early. - At 8. Always. That's better. Come closer towards me. Don't worry about it. - Ludovic, finally... Go home. - I'm borrowing him for a moment. How is your daughter? May I? I'll get you for this. - Why are you hiding? What do you want with that woman? - How dare you! Will you bring her over, one day? I feel alone. Young girls bore me. Well, introduce me. Bring her home, right away. - Invite her for dinner. And what about me? Behave. Here. And you should thank me. - Thank you, Mr. Cruchot. Those young people have some guts. Did you see that? - Especially the girls. The one that threw herself at you, well... I hope your daughter will never be like that. When can I see her? - Let me top you up. I can see her, can't I? When? - Yes, yes. When? You invited her. I'm going to my room. I've seen enough of her. I don't like her. Nicole, listen... - No. Yes. Who is it? Peek-a-boo. Am I interrupting? - Not at all. For the little one. - You shouldn't have. A first meeting is important. Look what I bought for her. Cute, isn't it? You think she'll like it? Is she around? Yes, but she's asleep. - At this hour? She still needs a lot of sleep. - What a shame. Is it interesting? She's got toys for Nicole. - He's in trouble. Attention. Dismissed. It's getting late. I should be going home soon. Hello, madam. I had a good sleep, daddy. Is that for me? I don't want it. It's ugly. Then what do you want? - Real birds to pluck. How old is she? - Five, madam. That was you last night in the Byblos. - Very observant. Why did you say she was little? - To look younger. You're driving him nuts. - Let me make some coffee. The kitchen is over there. You're so hostile. - You're making my dad go off the rails. He does the same to me. - You already were. Don't provoke me. - You're not the woman for him. Do you really think so? - Yes. Nicole, let's be friends. Call me Jos?pha. I've been impertinent. Sorry, Jos?pha. Am I wrong? - Definitely. Daddy, did you really not like what Jos?pha was wearing yesterday? I'll be... How dare you? - Thank you, Nicole. Too much authority is bad for young girls. I'm getting sugar from the sergeant. I always dreamt of an adult daughter. A woman can only be understood by a woman. You scare me. Did you hear anything? Not at all. Is everything going well? Happy? Good. I'll get the sugar. - Thanks, sergeant. What's on the second channel? There's a match... Bravo. Very good. A unique concert by the Carpecque quartet. Jos?pha's diet. No, not that one either. And now wallpaper for the bedroom. Cruchot, don't pull such a face. I thought a picnic would cheer you up. Eat something. - I'm not hungry, sergeant. Drink something then. Love is not your thing, is it, chief? Either he leaves or I do. Fougasse, go sit somewhere else. - At seven meters. Seven meters. Him too. He's laughing at me. - I didn't say a thing. I'm eating tomatoes. - Merlot, you go too. Seven meters. Sergeant, they've become inseparable. The colonel's wife is a cradle snatcher, a spider. A spider that weaves its web around me, poor cocoon. Pass me the camembert? Chief, can I have a piece of reblochon with a bit of butter? Wine? - No, thank you. I see that you trust me. I'll talk to you as a friend. You're right. She's not the woman for you. Break up with her. Do it right away. You should break with her. I have a plan. What if she finds you in the company of young girls? You must, you must. Listen carefully. You invite her to the Byblos. But you don't go. I'm going. And I take her to another place, the Poster. There she sees you with those young girls and she detests you. That's when she'll give up, get it? Can't he leave for just a short while? - It's an urgent report. Work obligations, you know. I'll replace him. I'm replacing him. Is it ok? - Yes, fine. The sergeant's TV is broken. Good evening. Were you leaving? - Yes, I have an appointment. My husband's gone and the TV is broken. How is that possible? She'll keep you company. Don't be too long. The rank of head chief means quite some responsibilities. But I love my work. It's like a vocation. What do you think? I thought I saw him. - Unlikely. Excuse me. Shall we dance? - Wait. Do you feel like a walk? - What if the men come home? So what? Only for an hour. Mr. Cruchot needs somebody who encourages him to rise through the ranks. He has potential. - I must do my duty. I have an unpleasant surprise for you. I suggest we move to the Poster. Careful, there they are. It's not them. Let go of me. Yes. Now. What are they doing here? Give me the Byblos. - That's where we're going. Sergeant, your wife... Stop. Let me go. Sergeant... The moment of truth. Are you looking for somebody? - Let's dance. J?r?me. - Gilberte... My wife. Is that your surprise? Miss, connect me to the Poster. Quickly. I've been faithful to that loser for twenty years. You just wait. I'll never forgive you for putting me in this situation. Thanks a lot. Not pretty, Mr. Gerber. Sergeant Gerber? Phone call for you. Mr. Gerber? It's for you. - Hello? Who? Cruchot, you were supposed to be in the Poster. What are you doing in the Byblos? So he was in the Byblos after all. Everything's going wrong. A great idea of yours, really. But sergeant, it was your idea. - It was your idea. No, it was your idea. No, it was always your idea. Yes, I remember now. It was my idea. Idiot. Ludovic, I knew you'd come. Your sergeant doesn't want me to see you. I know. - He courted me. What? Oh no. He really courted you? And not badly, by the way. - Did you ever have a good look at him? He's a gorilla with no tenderness. Do you want to break my heart? Cruchot also takes the head chief exam. That woman is messing with his mind. You owe me a revenge. And you better pass. I can't do that to Gerber. I can't. You're better than him. Go to work. Jos?pha will be disappointed. - Stuff her. Will you tell her that to her face? He's not cooperating. - But that's very naughty. You want that promotion. I already bought your stripes. Soon I'll be buying stars for you. I know the ranks. What's the role of the gendarmerie in the defense of the country? The role of the gendarmerie in the defense of the country... Quick, we already missed the bus. The train only leaves in half an hour. Gentlemen, you all have an impressive record of service. This exam is used to find the best man among you. There is one written part and there are two oral parts. You'll write an essay about: La gendarmerie and gathering intelligence information. You'll have one hour. gentlemen. I'm out of paper. Gentlemen, can I have your texts? Did it go smoothly, sergeant? - Oh yes. That's good. - And you? Good. Very good. Did you mention the different stages? Of course. And the initial investigation. Initial investigation... Of course. - Of course. And training? - I started with that. That's not really appropriate. - On a separate sheet. The three stages? - Yes. And interpretation? You don't know about interpretation. Interpretation? Yes, I mentioned it briefly. And diffusion? - What diffusion? Didn't you mention that? Oh, diffusion. Why didn't you say that right away? But that's another matter entirely. Your turn for the oral exam. Good luck. Are you leaving? - You two are the last. I'm going to get some air. What are you doing there? Attention. At ease. Put everything back. What distance should a gendarme keep from a portcullis? 2.5 to 6 meters, colonel. - Very good. And the first shooter? The first shooter. Irritating, no? - No, not at all. That's the cherry on the cake. What were you thinking? Come down. Put everything back. Quickly. I'll report this. And? Did everything go well? - Very well. Quite easy. Very friendly... Gentlemen, we don't just want to add your results. We'll also look at your achievements through the years. It's up to the machine. The honor is bestowed on Saint-Tropez. Congratulations, head chief Cruchot. That's me. No? Excuse me. Congratulations. Colonel... Such beautiful stripes. Wait until Jos?pha sees you. Make sure you win. That's the family tradition. Win! - Can you take over from me for a moment? Mr. Cruchot... I was fined yesterday. - And by whom? One of your men. - I'll do my best. How nice of you. May I? - Sure. Are you coming to the terrace? - You're a darling. She was fined. She's quite enterprising. Champagne? Thank you. To... - To tomorrow. Today is good too. - Always aim higher. Come have a look. Please, come. Look at that. Put it on. - Oh no. Why not? - I wouldn't dare. No. Besides, I have to go back to my men. Urgently. Do it for me. - I've got too much respect. When I say No, it's No. Please. Five stripes. Five, you see that? Put your kepi back on. It's hot. On Tuesday, we received the officers. On Wednesday... I counted well. Five. Come, sergeant, it will pass. We have to get back quickly. During winter, there was hunting. During summer garden parties. Sometimes a reception at the Elys?e. Careful, there he comes. - Attention. Everything ok, Gerber? - Yes. Yes, who? - Yes, sergeant... Head chief. You'll get used to it. At least, I hope so. What a change. Such a beautiful desk... I'm sorry to throw you out like this. It's ok. - It's ok, who? Sergeant... chief. I picked them myself, head chief. - Very nice, Fougasse. And they smell nice. Some tea, head chief? Yes, please, Fougasse. In Gerber's new office. I'll show you. Come along. Nice, no? You'll be fine here. Very fine, head chief. It's temporary. Until I'm a colonel. Colonel, yes. I hope for you that will happen soon. And there is Fougasse. Thank you. - Your tea, head chief. There's already sugar in it. It's hot. I might hurt myself. - Wait. Thanks, Fougasse. You can go. Close the door. At your service, head chief. If you ever... No, don't sit down. If you ever have a problem, you can come to me. No, I'm at your disposal, head chief. I don't like to give you orders. Well, in your place, I would... - Such ugly thoughts. Listen carefully. If you ever, after a lot of hard work... ...reach a responsible position, like me... ...do as I do and stay down to earth, modest. No arrogance. Fougasse, inspection on the beach. Was the tea good? - Lovely, Fougasse. It's getting serious. - It sure is. I picked them. For you. Thanks, kid. Some exiles return, Merlot. They've only been exiled temporarily. - I hope so. Look at that. Did you see that? We're going to calm down those idiots. - We're no amphibians. But you will be. Operation Grouper. On my orders, attention. First lesson: dive and resurface. Attention. That wasn't so bad, was it? Attention. Sergeant Gerber, come along. Sergeant Gerber... Our BK-705 machine isn't working well, apparently. Sergeant Gerber should have gotten the rank of head chief... ...not sergeant Cruchot. Head chief Gerber, congratulations. And my apologies. Your salary will be adjusted. That's easy to remove with scissors. Merlot, my car. - Yes, head chief. Alright. I picked them myself, head chief. - Some tea? My loyal Merlot. Where's Cruchot? - Here, head chief. Oh, there. Are you there yet? - I'm writing you a letter to congratulate you. Operation Grouper was a great idea of yours. Thank you. - I could have thought of it myself. By the way, I did think of it. It was my idea. Tomorrow you dive in my place. There are medical objections. And listen well. Not only will you dive... ...you'll dive first. Well, if I have to, I have to. There are too many waves. Nonsense. To the bridge. - I don't feel well. To the bridge. - I'm getting ill. I don't care. Throw him in the water. I'm getting dizzy. - In the water with him. I want to go back up. I'm scared. Close the helmet and leave me alone. Now dive already, or... Oh dear, he's drowning. We have to save him. Throw out the anchor. Nicole... Nicole... Are you getting any better? - Oh yes. Do you need anything? - Cider with hot croissants. There's my good fairy. My good fairy... Don't forget the cider. My good fairy. - He recognizes us. It will be better tomorrow. Now go sleep. It's late. Ok then. But keep me posted. Goodnight. I have to get even with Cruchot. I won't cross the border before I do. Drive. Ask for the head chief. But... - The head chief. I want to speak to the head chief. - Who are you? Personally? At this hour? OK, one moment. Tell him to come over here. - Why? You're in love with him, aren't you? I hope for your sake this is not a silly joke. At night I want to sleep. Hello. Who? Ah, it's you. You can go. - I'm on duty. Not anymore. Dismissed. What can I do for you? - Tell him you're crazy about him. You're always on my mind. Come quickly. Oh Jos?pha, we met too late. But I'm coming. I'm flying. I'm leaving. I already left. Poor Cruchot. She only loves winners. And now to your room. Don't worry, you're not my type. Put this on. - No. Daddy, what is it? - She's calling me. She's in danger. I know. I'm coming, Jos?pha. I'm going to see her. Where are you? I'm here. Here, darling. Is this possible? This is a dream. A nightmare. Wait until you wake up. That bitch fooled me. Come quickly. Fredo the Butcher escaped. He's here, I tell you. You went too far. I'm coming. Oh, Jos?pha... Where are you, Jos?pha? Jos?pha, easy now. I'm with you my sweetheart, my little darling. Where is my cutie? My colonel's wife, my little cupcake... What are you doing here? Are you after my fianc?e? I'll kill you if they catch me before the border. Go on. There's nobody. Fredo's in jail. Such nonsense. Don't laugh about it. - I'm having a look. You inspect the basement. Hey, what are you doing here? Ludovic. Help. 55-01 to 550. That's daddy's voice. Quick. - Come on, answer. 550 is listening. - Fredo kidnapped Jos?pha. I'm following their car. Get backup. Other corpses, helicopters, the works. Understood, 55-01. I'll take care of it. I'm going there. Are you asleep? I need backup. Quickly. That spells trouble. - Hurry and stay in contact with him. I'll get you, just wait. Gendarmes. Follow them. The helicopter's flying south. - So they found them. Start the pursuit. Hello, 55-02. I'm going to force him of the road in the turns. Keep in contact. My son... It's been so long... - Step on it. Faster, faster. - Who are we chasing today? A thief? A murderer? A sadist? - My fianc?e. She was kidnapped. Trust the Lord, brother. He helps if you deserve it. Slower. Sister, we lost something. Saint Anthony will return it to us. Nicole is a big girl now. Shouldn't she get married? You just watch the road. We're touching the road. - Hold on to me for counterweight. Careful. We're touching the road. Hold on to me, I said. Good luck, my son. Ludovic. What are you going to do, daddy? - Just wait. Ludovic... Ludovic... I'm here, Ludovic. Where is he? - There. He's sleeping peacefully. And don't you wake him. Daddy, when are you going to ask? Go on. - Madam... Will you marry me? - Finally. Congratulations, head chief. - That's two of them. That's going to be fun. I didn't say a thing. A game of jeu de boules tonight? - No. Why not? But why not?
