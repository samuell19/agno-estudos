[♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Morning. So, uh, here I am. All ready for battle. I'd better introduce you. This is Mr. Peter Wakeling, our new colleague. Mr. Wakeling, Mr. Hart. How do you do? How do you do? And Mr. Rusbridger. How do you do? How do you do? You're eagerly awaited. We've been short now nearly two months. Oh, well, I hope to make a difference. [CHUCKLING] It may take a week or two, though. Don't worry, old chap. This time of morning, it's a kind of rule. Not too much fun and laughter. Rather like church. Hm. Yes, I see what you mean. [♪♪♪] [BRAKES SQUEALING] [STEAM HISSING] [WHISTLE TOOTS] First day's always a bit nerve-racking. [CHUCKLES] Yes. You'll get the hang of it. As for these chaps here, they'll improve somewhat once they wake up. It's not us you have to worry about, Mr. Wakeling. We're your pals. You'll need to get on the right side of the old man. You mean Mr. Williams? He seemed decent at the interview. A little on the frosty side, perhaps. The truth is, I didn't really get to see too much of him. You're about to get another chance just now. His station's coming up. GUARD: Mind the doors! [DOOR CLOSES] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Is he coming in here? Oh, no. He never travels with us. [♪♪♪] Good morning, gentlemen. ALL: Good morning, Mr. Williams. HART: Come along, Mr. Wakeling. [CLOCK CHIMING IN DISTANCE] Good morning, Sir James. Mm. [TYPEWRITERS CLACKING] [PHONES RINGING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Mr. Rusbridger, why has this D19 come back to us? Mr. Wright at Planning was of the view that a remittance certificate should be attached to it. WILLIAMS: A remittance certificate can only be issued after the D19 is authorized. Yes, I tried to tell Mr. Wright that, Mr. Williams, but he simply won't have it. Then we can keep it here for now. It'll do no harm. Consider yourself very fortunate, Mr. Wakeling. Bequeathed one of our tallest skyscrapers. Courtesy of Mr. Woodward, your predecessor. If your skyscraper isn't very tall, or God forbid you work so fast you don't have one at all, people will suspect you of not having anything very important to do. I see. So here's your first rule, Mr. Wakeling. Keep the skyscraper high. The ladies from Chester Street, sir. Please show the ladies in, Mr. Singh. Mr. Middleton, your turn, if you don't mind. Of course, Mr. Williams. Mr. Wakeling, perhaps you'd like to assist Mr. Middleton with the ladies. Of course, sir. Ladies. How are we today? We were elsewhere in this building all yesterday. First at Parks, then at Planning, then at Cleansing and Sewage. Just before closing yesterday, the gentleman said we were to bring this to you. Let me speak with Mr. Williams. Just a moment. [PHONE RINGS] Public Works, how may I help? New here, ain't you? Yes. First day, actually. You enjoy yourself, son. No end of entertainment you'll get here. Eliza. I'm just chatting with the young gentleman. Your letter and your petition are very well presented. We, of course, know this from before. However, you must first take it to Parks and Recreation on the third floor. We were there yesterday, sir. They even thought to offer us a bench to sit on. That's how long we was there. Eliza. MIDDLETON: I do apologize. And we don't wish you any further inconvenience. So Mr. Williams has suggested you be accompanied by a member of our staff to ensure there's no further confusion. This is Mr. Wakeling. Oh. Splendid. Uh... Splendid. Yes, then I-I'll make sure, um, all the confusion is... ELIZA: Well, that's lovely, son. Then you'd better hop over to our side of the fence. Yes, quite right. Thank you, Mr. Singh. If you ladies would care to follow me. SMITH: Allow me to lead the way, Mr. Wakeling. We're perhaps more familiar with this building than you are. [DOOR CLOSES] WILLIAMS: Forgive me, everyone. Unfortunately, I shall be obliged to leave early. At 20 past 3. Uh, Mr. Middleton, perhaps you'd be so good as to deputize in my absence? [EXHALES SHARPLY] Yes, of course, Mr. Williams. I'll see everything stays shipshape. Thank you, Mr. Middleton. Is it really true you may be leaving us, Miss Harris? It's not certain yet, Mr. Williams. I did have my interview and it seemed to go well. It's Lyons Corner House. So will you become one of those, um... What do you call them? Skippies? Nippies? HART: You'll look fetching in that apron, Miss Harris. MARGARET: It's an assistant manager's post, Mr. Hart. At least, once I've settled in. HART: I wasn't trying to be cheeky, Miss Harris. RUSBRIDGER: Oh, they do an excellent treacle sponge. At least the one on Coventry Street does. Good idea, sir. Hm? Mr. Wakeling, I mean. A playground's what's sorely needed, love. There's nowhere for them to play. PORTER: A cesspool. No other word for it. Rats the size of that. And our houses backing right on to it. [SIREN WAILING] What on earth? You'll have to get used to that, love. [♪♪♪] So you were saying it's the K staircase? Yeah, the K staircase. Right-o. So that hallway? Yes. Thank you so much. You're welcome, sir. Good morning. This way, ladies. If you will. [INAUDIBLE] Come on. Parks have insisted this is-- That's all very well, but we've been through this before. First we need all that water drained. I've explained this to you already. Cleansing needs to look at it first. Good day, ladies. [WATER DRIPPING] HARVEY: A children's playground? So this isn't for us, but I'm sure the Public Works Department will be pleased to assist you. Public Works? That's where he's from. You're from Public Works? Well, yes. First day, actually. Why on earth have you brought these good ladies here? I do apologize. Yours is an excellent scheme and I wish you well with it. Take this back to your office at once. These ladies deserve better. Good day to you. [CLOCK CHIMING IN DISTANCE] [SOFTLY] Ahem. Mr. Wakeling, what may I do for you? The ladies' petition, sir. Mr. Harvey at Cleansing insists that this is for us after all. Mr. Harvey is quite wrong. But we can keep it here. There's no harm. Thank you, Mr. Wakeling. [♪♪♪] [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] MATTHEWS: Where did you decide on in the end? Bournemouth. Ten days starting next Monday. Oh, lovely. You must be looking forward to it. Same guesthouse we stayed in year before last. The lady there provides a very nice supper. [INTERCOM BUZZES] DOCTOR: Next patient, please. Yes, doctor. Mr. Williams? Doctor will see you now. Thank you. I much prefer the beach in Bournemouth. A pebble beach is so uncomfortable. BUTTON: I couldn't agree more. DOCTOR: Mr. Williams. Please, sit down. Thank you. [CLOCK TICKING SOFTLY] The results have come back. And I'm afraid this time they're pretty conclusive. [SIGHS SOFTLY] It's never easy, this. Quite. I said, "If that's what you want, then I know a place where you can get it." That's incredibly wicked of you. [CHUCKLES] [DOG BARKING] [CLEARS THROAT] Good evening, Miss Fry. Good evening. [LAUGHING] Stop it. She's still watching us. How can she be? She doesn't have eyes in the back of her head. I assure you she does. Oh. FIONA: If your father's in, this is a good time to talk about you-know-what. MICHAEL: Not a good time. You'll have to start the ball rolling at some stage. But not tonight. I'm really not up for it. Besides, he's not in. But this isn't his cinema night. [DOOR OPENS] MICHAEL: Hello? Dad? [DOOR CLOSES] He missed his cinema on Tuesday, so he's gone tonight. FIONA: As I was saying, you can't put it off forever. I don't intend still to be in this stifling house come Christmas. Christmas? How can anyone purchase a house and move in that sort of time? And besides, it is his money. We can't-- Your mother intended that money for us all. What's he sitting on it for? We're the ones who need it. You have to speak to him, I mean it. [GASPS] Mike! Father. What on earth? Oh! Dad, you gave us a start. Thought you'd gone to the pictures. Dad, are you all right? Yes. I was just sitting here, uh, thinking things over. And then you two walked in. Will you sit for a while? Well-- No. We both have early starts. I have to get ready for bed. You should too, dear. Good night. Well, better get going. Heard what the boss just said. Yes. [♪♪♪] [CLOCK TICKING] [DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE] [RAIN PATTERING] Come on. Mum's leaving us behind. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BAT CRACKS] [CHEERING] FATHER: Well done, your boy. [CLAPPING] Well done. MAN: I'm being serious. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Chap like you needs a wife. As for your boy, well, he'll come round to it. Youngsters get used to anything. MICHAEL: Dad? [MUFFLED] Dad. Dad? Michael? MICHAEL: Would you lock up? We're not coming down again now. Dad? Dad, are you there? Yes. Night, then. Good night. [FIONA & MICHAEL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] HART: He's never late. Something must have happened. MIDDLETON: Daughter-in-law said he'd left as usual this morning. PETER: Do you think we should, um, you know, alert the police, perhaps? MIDDLETON: Mr. Williams is hardly an infant. What will the police care that he's a couple of hours late for work? RUSBRIDGER: "Couple of hours late for work." Who would ever have thought? Leaving early yesterday. Late today. Maybe he's just, you know, decided he's had enough. Gonna give it all up. [CHUCKLES] I don't appreciate that suggestion, Mr. Hart. In fact, I find it in rather poor taste. Pity he should choose today of all days. Why's that, Miss Harris? Because the Lyons Corner House have requested my reference. So I need Mr. Williams to-- If it's a reference you're after, Miss Harris, I'll be happy to step in as Mr. Williams' deputy. Hang on. He's just a little late, that's all. There's no need for you to-- Quite. Thank you, Mr. Middleton, but I'd prefer to wait for Mr. Williams to return. SUTHERLAND: How can it be that in this resort town of ours, insomniacs converging from every corner of the land, a fellow's not able to buy such a thing as a sleeping tablet? Oh, you don't half go on, Mr. Sutherland. If you was really sleeping as little as you say, I don't see how your brain could keep coming up with them ridiculous phrases. Never mind your... Well, "entertainments," shall we call them? Consider, I beg you, my last great work. "Shocking Stockings." I very much suspect you judged it to be smutty and trivial. You know very well, Mr. Sutherland, I never saw it. My point exactly. The dramatic vision of your most loyal customer, and you shun it, you turn away with a blush. Would it have been that way in Paris? Where, triumphantly disowned by my entire family, I so deliciously misspent my youth. The night, the wine, the women, the cabaret, the Moulin Rouge. Who knows? Had you been born French, you might even now be kicking high those lovely legs of yours for the appreciation of a discerning audience. Mr. Sutherland, really. This little town of ours, Mrs. Blake, English it may be, but I still have high ambitions for it. Bournemouth, Bognor Regis, they're long beyond reach. But here, hope still lingers. I could achieve all this. All this and more for this town, if only... If only I could sleep. WILLIAMS: Excuse me. I don't mean to intrude. You do not intrude, sir. In fact, you are most welcome to join our conference here. That's most kind. But I wondered if I might have a private word with the gentleman. I see, yeah. Well, I'll leave you to it. [CLICKS TONGUE] The things that go on. Well, sir, may I take it you're inviting me aboard? If you'd care to. [SIGHS] Excuse me. I just thought, overhearing what you were saying... Yes. If you like... You're welcome to these. Very kind of you, old man. It's just what I need. And... These. Rather a lot, old man. I'm grateful to you. I'll take them off your hands. I did think about it. But I don't have it in me, that kind of thing. Think of the inconvenience to your landlady. Odd. I thought about exactly that. It's not perhaps quite what you think. [SIGHS] You see, this is rather a bore. But the doctors have given me six months. Eight or nine at a stretch. I'm so sorry. Funny. You're the first person I've told. The thing is, I just came down here. [STAMMERS] Look, you're most welcome to those. I've no more need of them. Six months. Nine. It doesn't seem long, but it's something. Enough time to put things in order and to live a little, if you chose to. I withdrew some cash. It's almost half my life's savings. Look here, old chap. Enough of that. You need to be more careful. You see my problem. I withdrew this cash and came down here to... [SIGHS] ...enjoy myself, or live a little, as you put it. But I realize... I don't know how. [♪♪♪] ...began with a "W," but was pronounced "V." But they changed it after the war, for obvious reasons. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Yes! You're doing well, you're doing well. SUTHERLAND: ...body, I want her naked! Hey! Hey, you! Cordelia was being played by Perez. Then he needed to be tough. Hey! [LAUGHING] No, no, no. No, no. When a girl like that steals your hat, always cheaper to buy a new one. Out with the old. New phase of life! You see that hat? That's not bad. That could work. Do you know what I mean? Can you imagine something like that? I think that's good. I'm gonna talk to him. I'm gonna talk to him because, I think, for the right price... [PIANO PLAYING] ♪ Yes, we have no bananas ♪ ♪ We have no bananas today ♪ So it falls to me to steer the family line as a playwright. Hattie, this here is my friend, Mr. Rodney Williams of Esher, Surrey. This man before you now is grievously ill. Then why is he drinking? Why, indeed? He has decided to grasp life, what little of it remains to him. And we have to admire him for it. Don't you admire him, Hattie? If he's ill, then this ain't good for him. Hattie, you don't understand. This man who, until yesterday, was living a shell of an existence, has sprung to life. Look. He even has a new hat. [CLAPPING, CHEERING] All right, all right. Come on, come on. What else do we know? Who wants to be next? Yeah, I-- Yes. Yes, I have a song. And what can you offer us, sir? Um, I have a... I have a little Scotch on my mother's side. Looks like you've got a bit of Scotch in you right now. [ALL LAUGH] You're right, I am somewhat, but I'd like to sing you a song, if I may. If you happen to know "The Rowan Tree." Do you know that one? "Rowan Tree." Old Scottish song, right? Yeah, I have a little Scotch in me. My late wife too. Um... She was...

I was quite thrown there for a minute. I mean, by your new hat. Yes. I lost my old one. Well, it's jolly nice. I wonder what they'll make of it at the office. Yes. I wonder. What would be your guess, Miss Harris? Will my new hat go down a storm there? [CHUCKLES] Noah himself couldn't get something to go down a storm with that lot. I don't need to worry about them anymore because I have a new job. Oh, yes? Yes, that's why I'm so pleased to see you. Well, it's not the only reason, of course. I'm very glad to see that you're well and going about your business. When you didn't come in yesterday and the day before-- Yes, I have rather gone to ground. But, you see, I've had other, um... Well, never mind, I-- Tell me more about your new job, Miss Harris. Oh, well, you know about it, Mr. Williams. It's the position at the Lyons Corner House. A branch just around the corner from here. An assistant manager's role. At least once I get into the swing of things. I'm so excited. Sorry. No. I didn't mean-- Don't worry. County Hall is not for everyone. I am pleased to see you, Mr. Williams. I'm going to be honest. I do have the job, but it's subject to a reference. Ah... And because you were away... I see how I may have inconvenienced you. I was thinking of treating myself to a light lunch at Fortnum's. [CHUCKLES] If you'd care to join me, I could write your reference over lunch. Really? Why not? It might make up for the inconvenience I've caused you. Fortnum's? You know, Mr. Williams, when I see you bowed over your paperwork like that, I suddenly remember you are the same person. The one at the head of our desk, every morning and afternoon for the last 16 months of my life. But now I realize, you're not really like that at all. There's so much more to you. I mean, Fortnum's, your new hat. I won't give you a more favorable reference because you say things like that. I'm not trying to butter you up, Mr. Williams. I'm saying I got you wrong, that's all. Mr. Williams, if you promise, and I mean really promise to not get angry, I'll tell you my secret nickname for you. [CHUCKLES] I promise. You really mustn't get cross. It's not just you. I have them for everyone. Only I know about them. And my cousin, Rosemary, who I share rooms with. I see. For instance, Mr. Rusbridger. I call him the Hover Man. Well, because he just hovers his pen over the page, with the intention of doing work but never actually doing work. [CHUCKLING] And Mr. Hart. Well, I call him the Confused Chimney. Because he's constantly smoking and constantly bewildered. [SPUTTERS] Have you seen his eyebrows? "Mr. Rusbridger, on my desk." Doesn't have a clue. It's very good. All right. This time, I'll say the name, you have to guess who it is. He's on the fourth floor. Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar. Well... I suppose that would be Mr. Brown in Accounts. Correct! [BOTH LAUGHING] [GASPS] Excuse me. May I get you something else? A dessert? Um, not for me. But perhaps the young lady might. Yes. I've always wanted one of those ice cream sundaes. WAITER: A Knickerbocker Glory, miss? Yes. With the fruit and nuts on top. Of course. Thank you so much. Are you sure this is all right? Of course. But, Miss Harris, you haven't come around to your main point. You were going to tell me your name for me. Oh, no, it's a silly nickname. I don't think I'll tell you. No, no. You've come this far. You have to tell me. All right. Remember your promise to not get angry. Mr. Zombie. Mr. What? Thank you. Mr. Zombie. I saw a film about it with what's-her-name. Zombies are sort of like Egyptian mummies, but they can walk and go about doing things. They're sort of dead but not dead. Mr. Zombie. My, my. I'm so sorry, Mr. Williams. That's really wicked of me. You mustn't be upset, Miss Harris. Mr. Zombie. It's rather good. It's quite appropriate, in fact. I like it. Mr. Zombie. An Egyptian mummy, except I can move about. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Your Knickerbocker Glory, miss. Thank you so much. Mmm! [♪♪♪] [LAUGHING] [CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [BIRDS CHIRPING] I'd better be on the 4:56. Or else I might find myself sharing the same train as our colleagues. That would be awkward. I do wonder, we haven't been terribly wicked? Pbbt. You don't have to worry about that any more, Miss Harris. You just keep your mind on your Lyons Corner House. I will. I was thinking about you. Oh. Don't worry about me. I've had a wonderful afternoon. So have I. Well, Miss Harris, goodbye. Goodbye, Mr. Williams. [PHONE RINGING] [CLEARS THROAT] HART: No doubt she'll pop back Monday. It's rather bad form, really, isn't it? Even if she is leaving. HART: We know it's a Lyons Corner House. Mr. Middleton, as acting head, wouldn't you be able simply to look it up? That would be highly irregular, Mr. Rusbridger. What, even if there may be far more than curiosity at stake? Look, really! Really. I... I do wish Mr. Williams would come back. Perhaps things would go back to... being a bit more orderly. ...just as I did, with this very young woman. Goodness knows what they would think, and how would that reflect on you, living in the same household? That's why I just wanted to tell you. Well, good evening. Come on. MICHAEL: The woman is a public nuisance. A prize mischief-maker. Nothing she likes better than to put-- [SHUSHING] Look, are we really supposed to believe that my--? You have to speak to him, if people are talking about this here. [♪♪♪] WILLIAMS: Look here, there's something I want to share with you both. It's, um... It's a bit of a bore, really... but, um... I probably should, um... [SIGHS] It's outrageous. At his age. And as for this girl, barely a woman. Certainly not a lady. It does all fit. The calls from his office, the savings. You simply must speak to him. You should have done so long ago. About everything. I'll speak to him, all right. With pleasure, I'll speak to him. Look here. There's something I should probably talk to you about. I... [BREATHES DEEPLY] [CLOCK TICKING] [MUTTERING SOFTLY] Oh. Here you are, Father. Smells wonderful. Yes, I do hope you'll enjoy it. [MUTTERS SOFTLY] Alf Jordan sprained his ankle while on holiday. Unlikely to be fit for the start of the season. Oh, dear. How unfortunate. It's a bit of a bore, really. Darling, this is hardly the time to be reading. Sorry. Are we ready? FIONA: Of course we're ready. Ready as we'll ever be. Shepherd's pie. Yes, and decent mince too. Shall I serve? No. Ah... How splendid. Thank you, darling. There was a time when what one did in London stayed in London. But these days, half of the street works in London. Well, that's right, my dear. Half the street. [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [WOMEN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY] [HICCUPS] [GROANS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [BELL DINGS] CUSTOMER: Miss. Miss? This sausage roll is cold. Oh, I'm so sorry. Miss? Yes, one minute, sir. You're new here, aren't you? Haven't quite found your feet yet. Shall I bring you something else, madam? Some more tea, perhaps? I shall think about it. Excuse me. Miss? Miss... Make it snappy, please. It's getting very busy. Of course, Mr. Adams. Mr. Williams. Skiving again. I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed to find you well into your third week here, still working as a waitress. It was an assistant manager's post you accepted? Yes. Well, I hope to be given greater responsibilities in good time. I might speak with your supervisor. No, that won't be necessary, thank you. Why haven't you returned to the office? You did say, last time, that you would. Yes. As it happens, I was just now thinking about that. [BELLS DINGING] After all, it's not as if I've found a wealth of other ways to occupy my time. Mr. Williams, it's very busy. I'm sorry. Yeah, of course. I'll let you go. But I... I did wonder when your present shift ended. Why would you mind about that? Why? For one thing, because they're showing I Was a Male War Bride at the pictures. I wondered if you'd care to come along. No, I shan't be encouraging this skiving any longer. You need to get back to the office. What will they be thinking? Yes. But, you see, today... [CLEARS THROAT] ...is my pictures day. And I was merely wishing for a companion. Oh, well. Cary Grant, Miss Harris. I understood you were quite fond of him. SERGEANT [ON SCREEN]: Any female trouble? GRANT [ON SCREEN]: Nothing but, sergeant. SERGEANT: Have you had any children before? GRANT: Oh, my aching back. You know that awful feeling before breakfast? SERGEANT: No, captain, I don't. Oh, sergeant, you're lucky. [♪♪♪] Mr. Williams. It's time I was going home. My cousin will be getting concerned. Oh, of course. But look at this. It may seem easy, but I assure you it isn't. Look. It's so difficult. Mr. Williams, I really must be going. Oh, of course. But before you go, Miss Harris, wouldn't you like to have a try yourself? I have a feeling, you see, that you'd be rather good at this. It's the rabbit. It's the rabbit we're after. Very well. Just once. Then I'll go. It's not nearly as easy as it... Oh, I say! [SCOFFS] Well done, Miss Harris. I might have known you could do it. Right. Now I'm going. Yes, of course. I'll walk you to your bus stop. Bravo, Miss Harris. [GROANS] Miss Harris. What is it, Mr. Williams? I wondered... if you'd... join me for a drink. A few minutes, that's all. Because, you see, I... I don't-- I don't feel quite able to go home just yet. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, this isn't very nice, really, is it, Mr. Williams? I know it's quite innocent, and I'm not implying anything, but... you're much older than me. And someone might suppose that... you're becoming infatuated. Infatuated? I suppose... in a way, I am. But not quite as some might suppose. I realized, since you arrived, how very different it had been. I confess, I did at times worry if your attitude was, well... appropriate. But I came to appreciate you. And not simply for your youth. There was some other quality. Your appetite for life. The way you always make everything jolly and gay, even while working there with us. Mr. Williams, I'm just an ordinary person like everybody else. I have no such special quality. I try to stay cheerful, that's true, but-- Miss Harris, I wonder if I may confide in you. There's something I haven't really told anyone else. Not even my son. It's quite... a bore, really, but the fact is... The fact is, I'm not expected to live much longer. I have a cancer. Here. After receiving my news, I... I took to looking around myself a little. And that day I saw you in Piccadilly... I thought, "Look at her. Look at Miss Harris. If only to be alive like that for one day." I suppose I... I hoped you'd show me, or... teach me to be like you. Mr. Williams, your son... Why haven't you told your son? Well... I think the world of Michael. However, he's now... He has his own life to live, his own concerns, and that's as it should be. But you're correct. I'm behaving like an old fool. What was it, your name for me? Mr. Zombie. [CHUCKLES] Oh, yes. Mr. Zombie. I wasn't always. When I was your age, from when I was this high... what I wanted... was to be a gentleman. Nothing grand. Just a rank-and-file sort of gentleman. I used to see them in the mornings, all lined up at the railway station, whenever I went there with my mother. In their suits and hats, waiting on the platform to go into London. A gentleman like that. That's what... That's what I longed to be one day. How did it happen? I fancy it just crept up on me. Just one day proceeding the next. A small wonder I didn't notice... what I was becoming. And then I looked at you... and I remembered... what it was like to be alive like that. [SNIFFLES] I wonder if you ever stop on the way home and watch the children playing. In the street or in the yard. And when the time comes and their mothers call them in, they're often reluctant, they get a little contrary. But that's as it should be. Far better that than to be the child you occasionally see, sitting by himself in a corner, not taking part, not happy, not unhappy. Merely waiting for his mother to call him in. I've become afraid that I might end up like that child. And I so very much do not wish to do so. When the time comes... when my maker calls me... [SNIFFLES] Miss Harris... I hope you'll be able to forgive me for everything. I've kept you far too long. We must get you to your bus stop. Mr. Williams, are you all right? Never better. But we must hurry. Your cousin will be anxious. [PHONE RINGING] WILLIAMS: Good morning, Mr. Singh. Would you come with me? Good morning, everyone. MIDDLETON: Mr. Williams, sir. Welcome back, sir. Mr. Hart. Our file on the bomb site at Chester Street. Um... The one that the local ladies have been petitioning to turn into a children's playground. Ah. Now, I believe... Uh... I believe it's... Yes, sir. I believe Mr. Rusbridger has it now. Yes, Mr. Rusbridger, you took it off Mr. Williams' desk last Friday, the last time the ladies were here. Mr. Rusbridger? Yes, I did. It must be here somewhere. Mr. Wakeling, you say the ladies have been in again? As recently as Friday? Yes, here it is. We have just enough time before lunch. I propose we go straight away. Go, sir? We'll take the file with us, but please wrap it up well, it's pouring outside. That's just it. If I may say so, sir, it is very wet just now. I'm sure we'll manage, Mr. Hart. Mrs. Johnstone, we haven't been formally introduced. How do you do, Mr. Williams? It's a pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. Mrs. Johnstone, would you mind terribly remaining here and holding the fort? Certainly, sir. Thank you. Messrs. Middleton, Hart, Rusbridger and Wakeling, if you'd follow me. Thank you, Mr. Singh. Chester Street. District Line to Stepney Green and then a brisk walk. [RAIN PATTERING, THUNDER RUMBLING] [♪♪♪] [SNIFFLING] PORTER [SOFTLY]: It'll be all right, darling. It was a lovely service. I think everyone enjoyed it. Pardon? It was a lovely service. I think everyone enjoyed it. Yes. I think so. Yes. [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Here you are. McMASTERS: Ta, love. Good afternoon, Sir James. Jolly decent of you to show up. Good afternoon, Mr. Ryman. Middleton, sir. You worked alongside him. Must be like losing family. Yes, sir. It feels almost like that. I want you to know how very sorry we all are. Very good of you, sir. Thank you, Sir James. Look here, Mister... Middleton, sir. Middleton, quite. Perhaps you'd be good enough to come to my office Monday morning. We might talk this over. How best to handle it from here. Of course, sir. Naturally, one wants to give credit where it's due. But the way those ladies have been kicking up... In the end, it does a disservice to the memory of our dear departed friend. Such a self-effacing fellow. If he were here, he'd be the first to protest. Excuse me. Miss Harris. Hello, Mr. Wakeling. Hello. I saw you talking with the ladies. Yes, they're very distraught. They were so fond of him. Yes. Look, Miss Harris, um... Well, I suppose I was just wondering if, um... What were you wondering, Mr. Wakeling? Mr. Wakeling. Mr. Williams. I'm sorry to raise this here. But I thought it best to give this to you right away. Oh. It was among my father's things. Quite prominent. He's marked it "private and confidential." So he has. Miss Harris. We haven't been introduced, I know, but I wonder if we might have a word in private. In private? Yes. If you wouldn't mind. Of course. Excuse me. [STAMMERS] Not at all. This way. [SUCKS TEETH] Excuse me for bringing you away. Oh, no. No, not at all. I appreciate you coming today. Thank you. I'm awfully sorry. Must be such a huge loss. It is rather. We haven't really been introduced. No. I know that you worked with him. Yes, well, only briefly. Margaret Harris. Miss Harris. How do you do? How do you do? I'm sorry, I should have come and introduced myself earlier, but you seemed so busy-- Oh, that's quite all right. I really am dreadfully sorry. This must be so hard for you. One bears up. And I've been through this sort of thing once before. Oh, yes. Miss Harris... there was something I wished to ask you. Of course. There's something I can't quite, um... [GULPS] Did my father know he was ill? That he was dying? [INHALES SHARPLY] [SOFTLY] I don't know-- I don't know what to say. [INHALES SHAKILY] Because if he knew... and he told you... You see what I mean? Why...? Why wouldn't he tell me? Well... perhaps he... If he'd just told me... I'd never have let him leave us like that. In all that cold. Yeah. I'm sorry. Uh... Thank you, Miss Harris. [SNIFFLING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] What's that you've got there? It's nothing. I'll read it some other time. Any of you chaps get a chance to talk to Mrs. Smith? Or any of the other ladies? One appreciates them sticking up for the old man's memory. But they've quite convinced themselves that Mr. Williams built that playground entirely by himself. Parks did get more credit than they deserved. That's because they're called Parks. Sir James certainly got his share of the credit. Made certain of that. Sir James was quite crucial, as far as that playground's concerned. Suppose he was. You know, I can't help thinking... and I didn't know Mr. Williams the way you all did, of course, but... But it does seem to me that he-- That he changed. Yes. It was this playground business. Chester Street. District Line to Stepney Green and then a brisk walk. [♪♪♪] No, no, no, you must-- No, I insist, sir. Honestly. RUSBRIDGER: He was willing to traipse through all that sewage water just to get to the site. He did become obsessed. He was prepared to make himself a right bugger about it. I accompanied him once to Planning. TALBOT: This is it here. Leave it with us and we'll send it down to you. HART: That ogre Talbot was presiding that day. I was hoping you might see to it now, and then I could take it off your hands straight away. Well, I'm unable to authorize it just like that. Don't worry. I'll see it gets done. We'll send it down to you. Why don't I wait here while you check those entries? It's up to you, but it might be some time. We've got a lot on up here. Take all the time you need, Mr. Talbot. I'm quite happy here. Mr. Hart, you'd better get back. Tell the others I've been held up. Indefinitely. Of course, Mr. Williams. [♪♪♪] HART: He said he'd sit and wait all day if he had to. And he did. This is very good of you, Mr. Jones. I know we're placing an extra burden on all of you here. So this is what? A kiddies' playground? Yes. Urgent? We'd appreciate your giving it priority. Well, if you request it, Mr. Williams. Thank you, Mr. Jones. Thank you. You're very welcome. PETER: Instead of just leaving... he went over to each of them in turn... Thank you. ...looked them in the face... Thank you. ...thanked them all. Of course, sir. Thank you. Yes, of course. Anything. I appreciate it. Thank you. Much appreciated. That's quite all right, sir. Everyone. Parks did then rather pull out the stops, didn't they? Quite. HART: The Mr. Williams of a year ago would never thought of doing something like that. Actually, I witnessed something even more remarkable. I never told you chaps at the time because... Well, it rather annoyed me. So you see? For all these reasons, this isn't something we can contemplate for the foreseeable future. I'm sorry. I genuinely regret it. MIDDLETON: We'd gone up to Sir James's office to plead a case for the playground, and Sir James rejected it. JAMES: And the site is a disgrace. Unfortunately, just now, we have even more urgent priorities. Well, thank you for coming to see me. They're considering Anderson for the new editor's post at Punch. I don't fancy that, do you? Wouldn't be quite right. Man's obsessed with the ballet. Well, that's not entirely fair. Anderson also cares passionately about detective fiction and horses. Sir James... please excuse me... but I beg you... to reconsider. I beg you. Or at least keep the application open for one more week. What harm can that do? MIDDLETON: He begged him. He begged him to reconsider. And he wouldn't take no for an answer. But it came off. What's that? PETER: It came off. It must have done. The chairman did reconsider. Well, yes. Yes, I suppose he did. Those ladies may have a point. Yes, but we all put our shoulders to it. Yes, but... there's no denying the old man did push it. Could it be he knew? That he didn't have long? Knowing something like that, I suppose that might galvanize a person. Yeah, but he didn't know. His son was very clear on that. I'm pretty sure that's right. [CLEARS THROAT] I think he did know. Ladies. We mustn't be discouraged. There will be a way around this. I assure you. I don't know how you kept your temper just now, sir. [CHUCKLES] I don't have time to get angry, Mrs. Smith. HART: Something in the way he said it. Ladies. [INHALES SHARPLY] Well, perhaps we'd all do the same. All of us here. We'd work with extra urgency in a situation like that. Would we? It's a natural reaction. Well, I don't know if... I don't think everyone... we here, even... would necessarily have responded in quite the way Mr. Williams did. I agree. Hm. If he knew... he did an awfully good job keeping it to himself. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] It was almost like he... [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Yeah. You're right. He certainly set an example for us. [INHALES SHARPLY] Look here, everyone. Let me propose that we all make a pledge here today. Let's pledge to learn from his example. This lesson he set before us. Let's vow... never again to shy away from our responsibilities. Never again to push things under the carpet. Or upstairs. Or upstairs. Mr. Williams has shown us... Well, that if... If we put our minds to it, our backs into it, we can do even better. That's right. And let me say this here today. While I remain in charge of Public Works, we're going to be true to Mr. Williams' memory. We're going to get things done. That's right. Hear, hear.

Education insist this is for us, sir. And which one is this? The disagreement concerning the proposed prefabs at Saint Mary's School in Shoreditch, sir. Ah, that. Mr. Hart, can you look into Saint Mary's School? That's for Education, Mr. Middleton. It's a schools matter. SINGH: Even so, sir, Education insist... MIDDLETON: Well... we can keep it here for now. No harm. The postal run, please. Mr. Middleton. Yes, Mr. Wakeling? I'd like this in triplicate, please, Mrs. Johnstone. That will be all. Thank you, Mr. Singh. [DOOR CLOSES] WILLIAMS: I wonder, Mr. Wakeling, if I may now turn to matters you may consider more personal. [♪♪♪] I have no wish to belittle our playground... but I put it to you that it was, all the same, a small thing. And that it will, before long, go the way of most small things. It may fall into disrepair, or be superseded by some grander scheme. To speak plainly, we cannot assume to have erected a lasting monument. Should there come days when it's no longer clear to you to what end you are directing your daily efforts... when the sheer grind of it all threatens to reduce you to the kind of state in which I so long existed... I urge you then to recall our little playground... and the modest satisfaction that became our due upon its completion. [♪♪♪] Evening, sir. Good evening, officer. Everything all right? Yes. I just wanted to see this playground again. I played a... A small part, just a small part, mind you, in bringing it into being. I work at the LCC. Is that so, sir? Then the people here have a lot to thank you for. Oh, I didn't do much. The man who did... The man who did passed away this winter. Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams. Yes. He'll be remembered round here with... respect and affection. I never actually had the honor of meeting Mr. Williams personally, he was always that busy. If you was his friend, sir, then perhaps you wouldn't mind my telling you this. Station sergeant says I'm being foolish, but, uh... It stays on me mind. Please.

Mr. Williams had, um... He had a terminal illness, you see. And I think it was right... that you allowed him that moment. And I think you're quite right. He was happy when you saw him. Perhaps as happy as he'd ever been in his entire life. So I wouldn't worry yourself any more, officer. Good night, officer. Night, sir.
