[ Man ] This is a famous photo I look... during the October Missile Crisis, outside the Hotel Riviera. The entire Malecón was full of antiaircraft guns and cannons. We were expecting a U.S. invasion. I took this one in 1959 in Washington. Fidel placed a wreath before Abraham Lincoln. The photo's called “David and Goliath.” The little guy and the giant. This is Che Guevara and Fidel playing golf. [ Woman] Who won? Fidel. - Che let him win. - [ People Laughing ] Ah, the Buena Vista Social Club! [ Woman ] Compay Segundo! Darling! We should ask these people, the older folks from the neighborhood. “Where was the Buena Vista Social Club?” Where are the old folks? This guy will know.

[ Indistinct ] It's a private house now. - [ Woman ] It was No. 48. - But it's not there anymore. - We're looking for the old location. - Sure, the building's still there. - [ Woman ] Between 21st and 42nd. - At 31st. If you go up this way, it's right there. - You used to dance there? - Yes. I was born around there. It's a private house now. You take the divided highway. [ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen, Compay Segundo! Eliades Ochoa! It's that house with a line painted on the door. It's been gone since 1944. We've lived here since then. I remember the guys who'd throw parties at the Buena Vista. In its day, the best bands in Cuba played there. Know what I eat when I’ve had too much to drink? Black cocoquetta soup. Chicken consommé. You take a piece of chicken neck and fry it up. When it's no longer bloody, you toss in some chopped garlic. I think there are still some remains of the bar. Anyone who eats that will have no aches or pains. You like mutton consommé? It clears everything out.

She told me that. “Grandson, until I die, you cannot leave my side.” I used to light her cigars. I was five years old. She'd say, “Light me a cigar.” And I would, from the age of five on.

In 1958, when I was no bigger than a guitar... I began playing all around Santiago. In the red light district I'd play and pass the hat: “Support Cuban musicians.” That's how I made some money... which I took home to help out my parents.

[ Ferrer ] At one time, in Santiago de Cuba... my grandfather was... president of a French society. It was called “El Cucuyé.” A delegation of Africans... came to visit him there... and my mother really liked one of the African women. And when that woman left... she gave my mother this staff. My mother was a firm believer in this Lazarus... which I now have. I firmly believe in my Lazarus too. They call him “the beggar.” He's a powerful figure. He opens up paths... and helps the destitute, you might say. The other one's the same... but this Lazarus is the one I carry inside... the one who asks for alms. I place flowers before him. Sometimes I light a candle to him. I give him honey. See? I pour honey in here for him. And lots of perfume. Lots of perfume. Every time I go out I spray him... and myself too. His little shot of rum. I like it... so I just assume if we like it, he must like it too. So he gets his little shot of rum. Sometimes my wife makes him a meringue. You know what that is? She makes it, and we place it there for him. We dedicate it to him. So that's how he gets all these things. We Cubans can be thankful... to, I don't know, the man up there that we are the way we are.

I was born in the city of Santa Clara... in 1919. At the age of seven I began studying piano. My family had bought a piano. It was a very good one, a John Stowers. It was a player piano too. It sounded wonderful. When I saw that instrument, I went crazy. I really liked it. I'd do all kinds of things on it. So I started studying. When my mother saw I had the potential... to be a great piano player... she arranged lessons for me... with a private teacher... from Cienfuegos. So I studied with her for one year... then two, three, four... up to eight years. That's when she told me... “Rubén, you're going to be a good pianist. You have great skill with your hands.” [ Ferrer ] I was forgotten. I just stayed home. But I wasn't going to starve. I shined shoes, I collected trash. I sold coal. I had a family to support. I'm not ashamed to say that. We moved from Santa Clara to Havana. But in the capital I started feeling insecure. I thought, “There are lots of piano players in Havana!” So I began to study... everything I could. It turned out that next door there was a man... who later came to be known as Arsenic. He formed a famous band. He heard me play. But Arsenic was blind. He wasn't born that way. He'd lost his eyesight in an accident. Anyway, one day he said to me... “Would you like to play in my group?” I said, “Sure.” His pianist had left... and gone to Europe. So I took his place and played with Arsenio for four years... and it was a successful time for me. People talked about how Arsenic would get argumentative... and they'd argue back... and he'd get really angry. You know what he'd do? He'd stand like this... and then lunge toward any voice he heard to grab that person. But since he was blind... everyone would just scatter. We'd tell each other, “Keep quiet so he won't know I’m here!” And he'd come at you like this. He'd get really mad... when people didn't show him respect. He was a big, strong, fat guy... and taller than everyone else. I'd laugh like crazy. [ Ferrer ] I swear I'm not gonna smoke anymore. Honest. Well, just a bit. Just a little. And no more drinking either. I used to drink. Man, did I ever drink! But I’ve got my bodyguard here. She won't let me. This is Arsenio Rodríguez. It's the best picture of him. May 24, 1946. The band toured a lot in Mexico... and also in Venezuela. This guy died a while back. Most of them are gone. This guy's still alive. He's almost 100 now. Pascualito is his name. He plays the timbal. Yes, he died in Spain. Well... I’m asking who wrote “Como Fue”... and it's this guy Ernesto Duarte, but he died in Spain. You always have to ask... “Who wrote it, and are they still living?” In case they may be here or they come down, you know? Get 'em to come down. More people have died... but so many are left... so we always want to try to find those people. They might be down the street. They might be here. Who knows? Might be around the corner. You never know. So it's 1998. We have to do the best we can. So we have Ibrahim in 1998. We're very lucky. [ Woman Translates In Spanish ] - Thank you. - Very, very lucky. I just don't want to die — At least not right now. The man up there and my wife over there... ought to grant me a bit more time to enjoy all this. Because sometimes you don't get time. [ Cooder ] That's right. [ Compay Segundo ] As long as I have blood in my veins... I'm going to love women. Because in life... women, flowers, and romance... are all so lovely. One night of romance is priceless! It's priceless. And I haven't forgotten how yet. I'm 90 years old... and I have five children. You met Salvador and Basilio. Salvador is the youngest. I have five... but I’m working on the sixth. I want one more. Well... see you some other time. [ Ferrer ] One afternoon, out of the blue... Juan de Marcos knocked at my door. I was polishing some shoes. He said, “What are you doing?” I said, “Just shining my shoes.” “I've been looking for you. Come with me.” “No, I don't want to sing anymore, “ I said. But he said, “Man, I need your voice.” So I asked him, “When? Tomorrow?” “No, right now.” “At least let me shower.” “No, right now.” He barely gave me time to wash my face... and wipe off a little shoe polish. So we came here to the EGREM studios... where I found Eliades Ochoa. He was here... with Compay Segundo and the rest. Rubén was at the piano. When Rubén saw me... he began playing... ♪♪ [Vocalizing Melody ] ...a number I'd made very popular here in Cuba.

I'd like to tell you a bit about how I became a musician. I started playing when I was nine. At 11 years old, I joined an orchestra led by my aunt, Coralia López. My uncle and my great-grandfather were both bassists. I was going to study violin... but my grandfather said, “No, it has to be bass.” It was one of those things. I was a little afraid of the bass... but it just took getting familiar with it. My way of playing is to get very focused. I like music so much. I've studied classical music, every genre. And I feel... I don't know. For me playing music is like a game. I played in lots of orchestras back then... and that's how I met Rubén. I'd played with a lot of pianists, but never Rubén. Now it turns out we make a great pair. My great strength is that I have a good ear. I can also sight-read very quickly. So before he plays a note, I already have that note in mind.

Here there's nothing but pure... musical energy. The udu drum, which makes the "goomp, goomp" sound — They all got a big kick out of it last time... for Buena Vista Social Club. They all would laugh and they'd see me — “Ah, goomp, goomp.” I became the guy with the funny sounds. It's not anything obvious, 'cause it fills a pocket... that so much of the percussion is going around — The “one” of each bar — That they usually leave out. It adds to what I know Ry kind of has in mind — A strange departure... in a bizarre band that never existed... back in the '60s or something. Puntillita took sort of an interest in teaching me stuff... and everyone's a percussionist. And it's almost those who aren't percussionists... that are the best percussionists.

My friend Nick Gold of World Circuit Records in London... called me up and asked if I'd join him in Cuba... make a record of Cuban music with some campesino musicians... and some West African players... which sounded like a great idea that had never been tried. I said, “Sure.” My wife and I had been in Havana in the '70s... kind of poking around and searching around... for this son music from a tape a friend had given us. It had some of the most incredible playing... and some of the most beautiful songs. I had never heard anything like it. So we got on a boat and went down there... and snuck around and searched around... and actually got to hear some good old-timers... but I didn't know what to do about it in those days. I didn't know how to proceed or anything, so we came back home. Been thinking about it ever since. So we got down this time... and Nick picked us up at the airport and said... “The Africans couldn't make it. They got hung up in Paris. What are we going to do here?” So we figured we'd just go ahead with whoever we could find. And we started asking around... and Juan de Marcos helped us out... and pretty soon we had a room full of people... including Compay Segundo and Eliades Ochoa... Ibrahim Ferrer, Amadito Valdés... Pío Leyva, Puntillita... and Rubén, Cachao. And Barbarito Torres, who is the laúd player. Turned out it was him on the tape I'd had all these years... that lured me down there in the first place. These are people I'd heard on records over the years. Had no idea if they were living or dead. Rubén González hadn't even had a piano in ten years. Hadn't really been playing. He told us he had arthritis and couldn't play. Of course, that wasn't true. This is an example of the luck and good fortune you have to have - to find out that so many of these people... were still alive and well, although forgotten... happy to play, very generous and openhearted... with their talent and their knowledge. It was a fantastic experience. It was the kind of thing I feel... that might be fair to say I've trained for my whole life. It's something very rare. Like I tell Joachim... “This might just happen to you once in your life.” Flying back to Los Angeles, I started thinking... what a great thing it'd be to get everybody together... and do a show someplace. By that time, the record had gotten so popular... that these guys were all really busy. The only place We could get everybody together was Amsterdam... at the Carré Theater - two nights in April. Everybody knows Carnegie Hall's the place to go. The Cubans kept asking me, “When are we going to New York? When are we going to Carnegie Hall?” I actually never thought it'd happen. But a lot of people worked hard and tried really hard. And on July 1, we were there. ♪♪ [ Salsa ] ♪ I want to dance at the beach ♪ ♪ Because the African's asked me out on a spree ♪ [ No Audible Dialogue ] ♪ On the beach I walk along ♪ ♪ Omara helps me with a song ♪ [ Ry Cooder ] It was a great night.

[ Ochoa ] This is so beautiful! You can see everything. [ González ] My plane flew in right along there. There's a plane taking off now. So they must fly in from this direction. - But not right over this building. - Let's go. [ Audience Applauding ] [ Man On P.A. ] Ladies and gentlemen, Rubén González! [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ González ] Where's the Statue of Liberty? [ Ochoa ] Over there. With the big point on top. Near those two towers there. You saw it when we came in yesterday. - Near that tower over there? - No, this one over here. That can't be the statue. It's all by itself, on the tip of an island. It's like that tiny one down there, but much bigger. I thought the Statue of Liberty had a crown. You can't make out the crown from here. You'd have to look through the viewer. You can't see the crown from here. Yeah, you'd have to get closer. But we know it's in that direction. That we do know. Let's move into the sun. You want sun? Let's go. - Have you ever been here before? - Yes, many years ago. - Up here? - Up here? - Who were you with? - No, not up here. I went to the statue, and we looked down - Who'd you go with? Some tourists. - That was in the 1920s, you said? - I don't know the year. I was about 30, and I’m 80 now.

I’m not an American, and I can't speak English... but I think I’ll start learning a few words... so that I can hold my own. [ Chattering ] I wish I could bring my wife and a few of my kids to see this. So they could see how beautiful it is. This is just beautiful. Look, Radio City. At least I’m getting to see it. I'm so happy to see all this. I could never have imagined. It's so beautiful. I’m really happy. [ Ferrer ] About two years ago... I decided to retire. I didn't want to sing anymore. I was disillusioned. I'd been through so much. You know how life is. I thought, “I'm bored of singing.
