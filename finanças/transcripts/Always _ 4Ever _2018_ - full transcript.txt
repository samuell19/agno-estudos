Don't you think it's a little mean? I mean, everyone already picks on him all the time. Really, Nicole? You know what? Forget it. I'll just do it. You can be left out while we have all the fun. Right, ladies? - Right. - MIRANDA: Right. No, no, no. I'm in. I'll do it. Okay. I knew you weren't stupid. Okay, everybody. Hands in.

And you know I would have never even taken that job if I knew how it was going to affect you. I know. It's just we've both been really busy and I feel like we haven't been able to spend any time together. - I miss you. - You miss me. - Yeah. - Mmm. - Well, guess what? - What?

Oh, my God, Miranda. - How are you? - How are you? Good to see you. What are you... Look at you. First of all, you look amazing. - Sit down, sit down, please. - Oh, thank you. What are you doing here? MIRANDA: Oh, I just came back from South Africa. South Africa? What were you doing there? Apparently saving animals has become my life passion now. - NICOLE: What? - Can you believe it? - I know, right? - Wow, that's amazing. And I met a guy. He's a doctor. I know. Can you believe it? Me? I never did nerds, and here I am. How about you? I haven't seen you since the wedding. Married life is everything I could have asked for and then some. You'll have to come by the house. Any time. Number's still the same? - Yes, yes. - Okay. Please call me so we can catch up. Definitely. So good to see you. - It's good to see you too. - I'mma let you back to work. - Alright. Bye, Miranda. - Bye. [R&B MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] Whoo! This is going to look so good. Oh, we gonna get some tonight. Ohh. [CAR ALARM BLARING] [SIGHS] Stupid alarm.

[RATTLING STOPS] [CRYING] [SCREAMS] [TELEVISION PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN ON TV: In other news, a woman found dead at her Los Angeles home last night. Sources say it was a suicide. - Back you, John. - Oh, my God. JOHN: There are growing questions about possible... Hey. You okay? [SIGHS] Yeah. When was the last time you saw her? Just yesterday at the café. Oh. Suicide? I mean, I just would never have expected that. She seemed so happy. She was raving about this doctor she'd just met and how she wanted to get married and everything. Mm. Well, how about this, hmm? You stop thinking about it, we order your favorite Chinese, maybe watch a movie, talk, get your mind off the stress of the day? I like that. - I love you. - I love you too. [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I just can't believe she's gone. It's unbelievable. I'm just like... Is that Brandi? Oh. Brandi Smith. What a pleasant surprise. It is nice to see you too, Sommer. I see not much has changed. It's good to see you guys after all this time. Sorry I couldn't come to your wedding, Nicole. You know, traveling the world, you know. Totally understandable. This must be the lucky guy? Yes. Brandi, Brian. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Unfortunate it has to be this circumstance. Yeah, it is. She was good people. - She was. - Yeah. Well, here. Hey, here's my card. You both should stop by the boutique sometime. - That'd be nice. - BRANDI: Yeah. See ya. Really? - I cannot stand that girl. - I know, I know. - Thanks, babe. - BRIAN: Yeah. I'm really sorry about Miranda, babe. Yeah. Ahh. Please don't stop. That feels amazing. Well, you know, it'd feel a lot better if you came and got in bed. It's pretty late. I know, I have... I have court in the morning. I've got to get this done tonight. Ah, that's crazy. You work more than I do. Yeah, well, at least my job keeps me in town. Alright, you got me on that one. Don't stay up too late, alright? - Okay. - BRIAN: Alright. - I love you. - Love you too. This man, Eric Johnson, violently took the life of Jason Simone. Jason was a father, he was a brother. He was also someone's son. Do any of you have children? What if someone took away the right for you to hold your child again? To tell them that you love them. Now, think about Jason's children. They now will have to grow up without a father because Eric Johnson took that from them. This man has no regard, no thought, no forgiveness in his heart. Now, he may not have had a perfect childhood, but who does? We all go through things in life that we wish we could fix, but that's life. And it does not give one the right to take it away because you're not happy with it. Thank you very much. ROGER: This is $5,000 a bottle. BRIAN: You did this? Wow. I'm sure we can find something sexier. ROGER: Alright, this is on me. BRIAN: You did... is this you? - This is the really good stuff. - BRIAN: You did this? This is the really good stuff. Yeah, I did this. Thank you. By the way, you guys, I'm glad we were finally able to do this. Cindy, it's nice to finally meet you. And it is so good to meet you, Nicole. Roger is always bragging about you. I've heard nothing but the best things about you as well. Oh, I doubt it. Roger doesn't say nice things unless I pay him. Oh, come on. That's why she's my best attorney. Knows exactly what to say and when to say it. And, Brian, I've been meaning to tell you, ever since you married her, she's been 10-0 in the courthouse... never loses. - Wow. - ROGER: Never. BRIAN: You got it all wrong though, man, it's her that makes me better. Babe, you know you make me... you make me better, babe. - Babe, aw. - CINDY: Aw, look at it. Look at it. Look at it. - How did you guys meet? - Well, we met on a dating app. - Dating... yeah. - Really? What's that? I don't know what that is. Sounds cool. - We didn't need that, dear. - No, we didn't need that. But... But, you know, we still instantly connected, and I remember when you first walked into the coffee shop. - Yes. - And I looked into your eyes, and I just knew. It was as if I'd known you my whole life. Yeah, I mean, four months later, we were married, and it's been nothing but happiness ever since. Okay, a toast to success. - ROGER: Yes. - Success. - And happy marriage. - Happy marriage. ROGER: Yes. Let's keep those wins rolling in. - Yes, please. - ROGER: Nice work. - Upsadaisy, here you go. - Whoo, oh, my gosh. My wife is fine. She'll be okay. Should not have had that last glass. Thank you, sir. - Are you alright? - Yes. Safety, hoo! [LAUGHS] Now get, wait, wait, wait, you go first. Oh, my, gosh, help me up these stairs, please. Oh, man. Is the door open? Hold on.

Great. How you doing? Glad you showed up. - Let's go get some boxing in. - Alright, yeah. TAMMY: Hey, I heard what happened the other night. Are you guys okay? Yeah. Well, nothing was stolen. Brian had a security system installed, so I think we'll be fine. Oh, my God, that is so scary. I can't imagine. You know, my neighbor's car got broken into the other day. - [SCOFFS] - Yes. People are crazy. Yeah, well, that's why I started taking kickboxing. - I don't blame you. - Yeah. I started yesterday. I mean, I gotta be able to protect myself. - And Brian. - TAMMY: [LAUGHS] Shoot, I might need to take some with you. Yeah, come. It can't hurt, right? - No, I need to. - Alright, so, what have you got for me today, Tam? Okay, so Westfield just filed a motion and the judge granted that today. Harris is getting really, really close on cracking in on that Johnson case. And Chris Simms called you twice about the Kester case. - Call him back. - Mrs. Taylor, Roger called. He needs you to cover for him today. Well, he's got that mediation at 8:00. That's in 30 minutes. You know, Roger really gets on my nerves. I'll be in my office if you need me. - Thanks, Tam. - TAMMY: You're welcome. [UPLIFTING MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] NICOLE: Hey. Hey, baby. You want some breakfast? Hey. No, I'm good. Why are you dressed? I have an emergency meeting in Phoenix. - About this new project. - What? Actually, Jesus, I got to run. My flight's in like two hours. I got to get to the airport. H-Hold on. When did this happen? I just found out last night. You told me you were off last night. Okay, well, are you forgetting about your mother's barbecue that we're supposed to go to this weekend? - You can still go. - What? - Yeah. - No. I'm not going near that woman. Your mother hates me. She doesn't hate... Stop. She doesn't hate you. She loves you. Once I move up in the company, I'll be in more control of my schedule. But for now, I'm on their clock, okay? Hey, I mean, I could quit if you want me to. - I could do that. - No, it's just that, you know, I wish you wouldn't leave me here by myself after what happened. I promise I will make it up to you, just as soon as I get home. Hmm? - You'd better. - Oh, I better? - Yeah, you better. - Oh, come on now, babe. You know I just put it on last night with the candles and bubble bath and all that, hmm? Hmm? You know your boy know what you're doing. - Go catch your flight. - Okay. Be good. That's good food in there. Eat that. Oh, wait. - Oh. - Forgot something. BRIAN: Love you. - Love you. - Love you too. Be good, be good, be good. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] TAMMY: Don't bring the afro. Wait, wait a minute. - What? - Why last night, me and Dante, we was getting it in, right? - Uh-huh. - And when we were done, he asked what I thought about marriage. - Oh, my God. - I think he's about to ask. You'd better say yes and not run him off. I'm going to say it. I'm not. I don't run people off. You'd better not mess this up. Shut up. I love him. Okay, something's wrong with you 'cause you've been sitting here moping and stuff. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm just thinking. Well, stop thinking. You're messing up the vibe. Okay, seriously. I want to ask you guys something. - Oh, Lord. What? - Okay. Do you think that Brian would cheat on me? - What? - Girl, Brian all weird-ass. No. No, I don't think so. - What would make you ask that? - NICOLE: I don't know. He's just... He's just out of town on business a lot. - It's called work, Nicole. - NICOLE: No. No, every year on our anniversary he always acts a little strange. But I don't know, this year something's different. - Mm. - Mm. Did you check his phone? Look at his e-mails, nothing? - Did you check his car? - His car? Because you never drive his car. You always drive your car when y'all go out, so maybe he won't think you'd search in there. Mm-mm. Knowing, mm, come on. Something is in his car. Let's check. What? Locked. You don't have a spare key? No, he usually takes it with him. Oh. Well, Brian is your husband, right? - What's that supposed to mean? - Call roadside assistance. They going to let you in through the satellite. - You're shady. - TAMMY: Mm-hmm. Alright. Can't believe I'm doing this. WOMAN: Roadside Assistance. How may I help you? Hi, yes, we are locked out of our car. WOMAN: Sure. Can I have your name, please? Yes, Brian and Nicole Taylor. WOMAN: And can I have the access code? The code? It's 1212. WOMAN: Stand by. Boom. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, it just worked. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - WOMAN: Thank you. Thank me later. Okay, clearly you've done that before. Well, girl, growing up in the hood, you learn a thing or two. [SIGHS] Okay. Alright. Let's see. Everything. SOMMER: Call Paige? TAMMY: Mm. Paige. That's a white girl name, too. Well, they get on my nerve. Tammy. Stop. You are jumping to conclusions. This doesn't... We don't even know if this means anything. - It's just a note. - TAMMY: Girl. Try your name. Okay. Oh, okay. - SOMMER: What is it? What? - TAMMY: Bow. Our names plus the date of our marriage. Oh. Okay. Paige. No results found. Okay. Okay, this is good. This is good. You should feel good. Right? You should feel good. She should feel good. - Yeah. - You know what? I'm sorry, you guys. I'm being totally paranoid. - You're right. - That's okay. Look, that's what we here for, to be paranoid with you. Oh, and I wouldn't tell Brian anything, not in the least until you have solid evidence to prove your case. - Alright? - Let's go get us a drink, 'cause you need one and I need one. We just all in the man's office. Girl. - Got my blood pressure all up. - Man, he just at work. [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, well, if it isn't my son's beautiful wife. Come on. Let me fix you some tea. So, how are you and my baby doing? Honestly, been a little bit concerned about all these business trips he's been leaving on. My Brian is a busy man, you know that. That's what you signed up for. And you yourself as a big-shot attorney, you're busy too. Yes, I know. It's just... I guess I've been wondering if Brian would ever do anything to hurt the relationship. Like? [SIGHS] Have an affair? No, I highly doubt that he would be cheating. An affair, no. I want to believe that, Mrs. Taylor. It's just that, right now, I mean, sometimes he's present, sometimes he's not. I just... I just don't know what to do. [CHUCKLES] A hippo? Extremely unpredictable. Making him the most dangerous mammal in Africa. - I did not know that. - Hmm. Men can be dangerously unpredictable, but not my Brian. You'd think after four years of marriage, I'd be able to predict him by now. Well, why don't you try talking to him? You'd be amazed at how communication works in a marriage. I would have have never been able to be with my Patrick for 30 years without communication. God rest his soul. Thank you. I needed to hear that. Come on, dear. I'm going to get you some barbecue. I'm so glad you came early so we'd have a chance to chat and talk before my loud friends got here. If you want some flip-flops, I got some for you. NICOLE: Thank you. Alright, babe. Got to run, got to run. - Love you. - Love you too. - Alright. - [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [SIGHS] COACH: Let's go. One, two. One, two. Good. Nice. Again. Good. One, two, one, two. Good. High kick. Again, again. - [GAVEL BANGS] - JUDGE ATWOOD: Guilty! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOWER RUNNING] [CELLPHONE CHIMES] - NICOLE: Okay. - BRIAN: Thank you. - NICOLE: You're welcome. - Love you, babe. - NICOLE: Love you too. Bye. - See you soon. Hi, yes, I'm just trying to access some of my phone records, and I seem to have forgotten my password. BRANDI: Cute. Okay, let's put that one on the left side. Let's put that over there in the front. - Brandi, hey. - Nicole Taylor. What a pleasant surprise. - What are you doing here? - Oh, I was in the area, thought I'd come and check out the boutique. - Let me show you around. - Sure. ♪ You make me happy ♪ [BOTH LAUGH] So what made you want to open a boutique here instead of overseas? I mean, I know you were modeling over there. I was keeping up with you, girl. Honestly, I got so wrapped up in that life that I almost died. Partying too much, not eating, trying to stay skinny. It just was a lot on me. So I moved back. I wanted to feel something familiar again, you know? Been sober for five years now. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, good for you. - Thanks. But enough about me. What about you? - How's Brian? - NICOLE: Amazing. Coming up on our four-year anniversary, even though it seems like only yesterday he swept me off my feet, so... I'm so happy for you, Nicole. I know how much you've always wanted that, - ever since we were kids. - [BOTH LAUGH] Yeah, thanks. You know, I never got to say sorry for what happened at summer camp. Oh, I mean, come on, Brandi. We were young and stupid. You guys may have been. I wasn't. - That was in the past. - I know. But it affected all of us that summer. DEVON: Camp is boring. Camp sucks. NICOLE: No, it doesn't. - YOUNG MAN: What's up, Devon? - What's up, bro? Hello, Nicole. NICOLE: Hi. DEVON: Oh, what's up, Piggy Pete? Oh, come on, Devon, do you need to keep making fun of me? Do you have to bother him? He's not bothering you. Nah, just him being here's bothering me. Forget you. Come on, guys, leave him alone! - You don't have to do that! - BRANDI: Nicole, stop. Stop being such a Debbie Downer. They're only kidding. Going to go cry to your mom now, Piggy Peter? Yeah, Piggy Pete, go cry to your mom. Come on, guys. Let's go. - Let's go, Nicole. - See you later, pig. BRANDI: I never meant for any of that to happen. Part of me was just being a kid but the other part knew I was taking it too far. Peter was a good kid. He didn't deserve that. I mean, we killed him, Nicole. Look, we've all done things that we're not proud of, that we wish we could take back. But what's done is done. The important thing now is what we do as adults. You're right. You know what? I should go. Hey, it was really nice seeing you, Nicole. You too, Brandi. Hey, let's not let any time pass before we do this again, okay? Life is too short. Couldn't agree more. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Looks like she OD'd on heroin. - Really? - Girl said she left at 8:45, came back a few minutes later, and found her dead. Shit. Hi. I'm Detective Tucker. What's your name? Jessica. It's nice to meet you, Jessica. So... So I understand you left around 8:00 or so? I left at 8:45. Came back 5 or 10 minutes later to grab my phone. That's when I found her. Did you ever see Miss Smith using drugs? No, sir. Did you ever see her looking distracted, strange behavior at the job, or anything to make you feel like maybe she had a drug problem? Never. If anything, she was completely against drugs. This is shocking, honestly. Alright. Thank you, Jessica. TUCKER: This is a very, very serious matter, as I'm sure you know. I talked to a young lady that worked with her, and she said that you were the last one to talk to her or see her before she died. Yes, I-I did stop by her store. - So you knew Brandi? - Yes, we grew up together. TUCKER: And you knew Miranda Smith too, right? Miranda, Brandi, our other friend Sommer. - We were inseparable as kids. - How close were you? Okay, why is any of this necessary, Detective? - I'm just doing my job. - Babe, it's okay. - Babe. - It's okay. How close were you all? Well, we went to elementary school together, summer camp. We were close as kids, but honestly we hadn't really seen each other for a few years until recently. TUCKER: Got it. So she never mentioned to you anything that would make you feel like she was going to relapse? No. Nothing at all. She seemed very in control of her life. She told me she'd been clean for five years. TUCKER: Never alluded to anything made you feel like - she was crying out for help? - No. Honestly, this whole thing comes as a complete shock to me. Well, thank you. Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, thank you. And I'm genuinely sorry for your loss. I will show you out. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Say you wanted to commit suicide, right, so you jumped off the roof. Do you think you would have enough time to change your mind, turn around, and grab something? Mm, probably not. Why? Because this autopsy report says that she had bruising and scratching inside her hand as if she was trying to grab something. Hmm. So what does that mean? That means that she was hanging onto something before she fell. Mm. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe she slipped. Or maybe she was pushed. Maybe she was helped. PATTERSON: And the Brandi girl, find anything on her? Her report. I checked it out. She was a model. She got arrested a few times... DUI, possession. But part of her probation was that she had to be admitted to a drug treatment program five years ago. But get this. She was addicted to cocaine and alcohol. She had never done heroin. Five years later, she ODs? I don't know, Detective. Maybe it's beginner's luck. You're not funny, man. This is serious. Alright. Talk to me. Both of the girls went to school together, they grew up together. Two girls go to school together, they both commit suicide. I know, it's a strange circumstance. It happens. I'm not buying that. I'm not. My gut tells me something ain't right. Detective Patterson, we need you. Yeah? Alright, one second. [SIGHS] You might be onto something here, Detective. Let me know. Alright, what's up? We got a multiple homicide situation. TUCKER: I'm sorry to call you down here on such short notice. Note that this is being recorded for the record. Tell me again about your conversation with Miranda before she died. She told me about her new boyfriend. We talked about our lives. I mean, not much. TUCKER: She didn't seem suicidal? No, no. Not at all. Quite the opposite, actually. She seemed really happy. Both were your friends. That's... That's devastating. I want to know w-what's your thoughts on that? All I know is Miranda was a great friend. She didn't deserve it. Brandi on the other hand, she... TUCKER: Oh, you had a problem with Brandi? That's not what I said. Why would you say "on the other hand"? One deserves it, it seems like you're implying someone deserved to die. What I meant was that she wasn't the nicest person in the world growing up, that is all. Where you from? You from the hood? I was raised in Maryland, went to college in South Carolina. Not so sure about the other girls other than they were my wife's friends. What was your relationship like with Brandi? I've known her since childhood. Knew her since childhood. And then we lost contact after high school. She got a modeling contract and then left the country, I mean, I hadn't seen her in years. Until you saw her at... at the funeral. Correct. So where were you the night that Miranda got murdered? I'm sorry, excuse me. Allegedly committed suicide? At home. Nicole called me when she first heard it. She called you first. Yes. She called me first. You don't know anybody who would want either of these women dead? No. Thank you, Mrs. Taylor. You're free to go. JUDGE ATWOOD: Not guilty. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Nicole, have a seat. Look, the partners and I feel it's best that while you're going through this rough patch, you take some time off. Wait, Roger, are you firing me? Of course not. You're my best attorney. Just lately you're not mentally here. I mean, you... you missed a couple of staff meetings. You've been late a few times. It's not you. Yeah, look, I-I have been dealing with a lot. - But I can fix it, I promise. - ROGER: Nicole. You lost your first case in years today. Your head's not in the game, and I cannot afford any mistakes. Roger, I started here as a temp 10 years ago. I've given this company everything. This... This place is my life. ROGER: That's why we're giving you a paid leave. Think of it as the vacation you've been wanting to take. Roger, please. ROGER: Till this whole thing blows over, okay? Great. [SIGHS] NICOLE: Been meaning to clean out this closet ever since Brian and I moved in. I've just been so busy with work, - haven't had the time, you know? - I've seen. Well, now you have all the time in the world. It's not like you got to go back to work today or tomorrow. [SIGHS] Yeah. What's wrong, Nicole? [SIGHS] I don't know. I don't know. You know, I just can't look at Brian in the same way. I don't want to believe that he's cheating on me. Brian is a loner. I mean, technically, you are all that he has. Look, if you really feel like the man is cheating on you, we can call my cousin Jerell, he can come over here, beat his ass, and we can just get it handled, okay? - You are a hot mess. - I know, and I got your back. - NICOLE: Oh, my God. - TAMMY: What? Ahh. There is some serious blackmail material in here. Mm-hmm. - Let's see. - Let's see, let's see. TAMMY: Ha! Look at your hair. Unh-unh. Why did your mom do you like that? Look, you know yours is just as bad. Oh, no, I burned my yearbook picture. Middle school was the worst years of my life. Ah, yeah, tell me about it, I couldn't wait to get to high school. Okay, yeah, high school, I was cute. Look at Miranda. She was so cute. - I'm sorry, Nicole. - Yeah. NICOLE: Well, and Brandi, she looks the same. She's been beautiful her whole life, damn. Oh, I see why y'all looked up to her. Oh, wow. Piggy Pete. - TAMMY: Hmm. - Peter Wells. Now, that boy was in love with me. Oh, I remember you telling me about him, the little fat boy that was crazy about you at the camp. Yeah. Gosh, we were awful to him as kids. Put him down, he can't swim! He can't swim! - Put him in the water! - He can't swim! - Nicole! - NICOLE: He can't swim! He can't swim! BRANDI: Stop! BRIAN: What y'all in here talking about? - What's up, Brian? - What's up? We were just looking at my old middle school yearbook. Oh, no. Oh, my goodness, let me see. Let me see this. Ohh, babe, you were so cute. Look at that. And even more beautiful now. Whoa, wait, is that little fat boy you said had a crush on you? Ah, yeah. We were terrible to him. Called him Piggy Peter because he was overweight. Young girls are so harsh. Well, he had his chance and now you all mine. I'm off to work. You ladies be good, alright? Bye, babe. BRIAN: Hey. You be sure and take care of her while I'm gone, alright? - I got you. - BRIAN: Okay. - Okay. - BRIAN: Okay. - Okay. - BRIAN: [LAUGHS] - Do you think he heard us? - I hope not. Okay, look, I've been doing some research, and I found out where the girl works. - Stop. - That old bar. TAMMY: Girl, we need to go up there and regulate. - I got my bat in the car. - Relax. Stop being dramatic. I was thinking more like we call. You know, I just want to find out what's going on. - I don't want to cause a scene. - Call. Okay. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Federal Bar and Grill. May I help you? - Hi, can I speak to Paige? - JARED: Who's calling? Tell her it's an old friend. - Paige. - Yeah? Who is it? She said it's an old friend. Hello. This is Paige. Hey, Paige, you need to watch your back, ho. What are you doing? Girl, look, if you want to do this, you need to do it the right way, okay? Go up there and bust this nigga out. Put on your sneakers. Alright, Jared, I'll see you tomorrow. Alright, have a good one. [SIREN WAILING] [ENGINE STARTS] [SCOFFS] [ENGINE STARTS] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [ENGINE STARTS] Hey, babe, you coming to bed? Nicole? Ah, yeah. This is... - It's not what it looks like. - It's not what it looks like? No, it's not what it looks like, baby. My friends are dying, and you leave me here alone while you're running around town cheating on me with some other woman? I am not cheating with you with some other woman. I saw her leaving your mother's house, Brian. - I can explain that. - You can explain that? Well, can you explain why I saw the two of your arguing in some random apartment garage? You've been lying to me, telling me you're going out of town on business trips when really you've been seeing her. Will you just stop it, okay? Now, I know what this looks like, but this is not that. - Really? - Really, it's not. - Really? - BRIAN: Yeah. Okay. So who is she? Who is she? Okay, first of all, I'm not cheating on you. Okay? Now, yes, I do know this woman. But it's not what you think. We work together. [SCOFFS] You're lying. You are lying. Babe, okay, listen. You got to trust me, I would not... NICOLE: You want me to trust you? When you've never even mentioned this random beautiful women who you work with, who knows your mother? Because I knew how you would react. I can't even look at you right now. Okay, alright. You want the truth? - Yeah, I want the truth. - Okay, truth time. She told me she was going to hurt you if I didn't sleep with her. Oh, so you did sleep with her. - No, I did not sleep... I... - Yes, you did! No, I didn't. [SCOFFS] [BREATHES SHAKILY] [VOICE BREAKING] You slept with her. No, I didn't, babe. I'm going to say this one last time. I did not touch that woman. You must think I'm an idiot. Now, you either believe me or you don't. - Well, I don't. - Okay. Well, she's crazy, Nicole. Yeah. And she's capable of a lot. I was trying to protect you. NICOLE: You were trying to protect me? - Then you should have been here! - Okay. You know what? Just... Just go. Just go. Just leave. - Babe, listen to me. - Get off of me. Get out of here now. Okay. Alright. - Nicole, would I... - NICOLE: Get out of here! [DOOR OPENS] [CRYING] NICOLE: So I followed her, and sure enough, she was there to meet Brian. So what happened? I watched them from my car. They were arguing. I don't know about what. [SIGHS] I got really upset so I left. And then Brian came home from his "out of town" business trip, and we had this huge argument, and I had to kick him out. - You kick... You kicked him out? - Yep. Oh, my God. Did you tell Tammy? Tammy? No. - Brian would be dead. - Yeah. I'm really sorry. Okay, you know what? Let's drink some wine. Everything's going to be fine. Here you go. I love you. I love you too. Thanks for coming. No problem. That's my girl. Come on. This is good. You're going to love it. ♪ You can be sure tonight ♪ ♪ I'm thinkin' 'bout you, baby ♪ ♪ 'Cause this is a first for me ♪ I hope you know I'm spending the night. Yes, please, of course. I'm not letting you drive after all this wine. - Right? - It'll be just like when we had our sleepovers when we were kids. Remember when we used to, like, try and pick which boys were going to be our husbands? You remember I was in love with Usher? He was my husband. - Yes, he was. - Mrs. Usher. I think you were obsessed with him, actually. Do you remember when my mom took me to a concert when I was 16, and I fainted after the first song? - Yep. I do. - Oh, my God. Okay, okay, but do you remember when I was married to Batman from Immature? - Oh, my God. - We had a wedding and everything and then I found out he was Roger from "Sister, Sister," and then we got a divorce. But I did... I did have that pillow with his face spray-painted on it that I used to cuddle. - You wouldn't let anyone else... - No. ...sleep on it. - Oh, my God, those days. - We were crazy back then. Yeah. But we always had each other's backs though. No matter what. BRANDI: Remember the deal, Nicole. You still have to kiss him. It's the only way that this will work. Are you crazy? I'm not kissing Piggy Pete. I have a boyfriend. Your boyfriend won't know. Nicole, it's all good. We got your back. - You're not in this alone. - Mm-hmm. Don't you want to be in the club? Yeah, Nicole. Okay. I'll be in the club. [SIGHS] I did not want to kiss him. Brandi was such a bad influence on our lives. I don't know why I ever listened to her. Maybe I was scared of her. I don't know. Brandi, Miranda. [SIGHS] It's just so scary, you know? Yeah. But you know what? We're going to be fine. Bae, we have each other. We have each other's back. You got me, I got you. Okay? Yeah. - What kind of wine is this? - The good kind. Oh, my God. Darling. Nothing less. NICOLE: Ohh. Sommer? [SIGHS] [CELLPHONE RINGING] Sommer? Sommer? [RINGING CONTINUES] [SCREAMS] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Now, I'm trying my best to help you out here, Nicole, I really am, but you know how this looks, right? What, you think I had something to do with this? That's insane. You were the last one to see Miranda alive, you were the last one to see Brandi alive, and you were in this house when Sommer was murdered. I mean, somebody must be trying to frame me. I apologize, but you got to come down to the station. TAMMY: She didn't do anything. - NICOLE: What? - TUCKER: We'll find out. NICOLE: What is this? Officer. When we get her down there, I'm gonna get it right into my interrogation of her. - Sir... - What... What's happening here? We're taking your wife down for questioning. Taking my wife? Babe. Excu... Excuse... Hello? Get your hands off my wife. What is going on? Babe, are you alright? Hey! Hey! TUCKER: She'll be alright. Babe? B... [SIRENS WAILING] I-I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Mrs. Taylor. You know your husband's waiting down in the lobby for you. He bailed you out. But before you go, I wanted to share this with you. We found these on the crime scene. They look familiar? You know anything about that? - I have no clue. - Mrs. Taylor. You must tell me everything you know if you want me to help you. P. Paige. Paige? Yeah, I don't... I don't know her last name. My husband was having an affair with her. Ooh. I can tell you where she works. He said that she threatened to hurt me if he didn't sleep with her. Really? Maybe that's what the P stands for. Paige. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're free to go, Mrs. Taylor. Hey, babe. Are you okay? Anybody hurt you in there? You... Are you alright? - TAMMY: Are you ready? - Yeah. You leave me and my wife alone, man. I'm just doing my job, man. Doing your job. Obviously not good enough. You better hope you find this person and catch 'em before I do. Paige Campbell? Who wants to know? You've been served. This is a temporary restraining order issued by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. And you've been ordered to keep a no less than 100-yard distance away from Mr. Brian Taylor and Mrs. Nicole Taylor. Do you understand, Miss Campbell? Yeah, but I haven't done anything wrong. Refusing to comply just gets you arrested. Take the package, Miss Campbell. That's it, I'm placing you under arrest right now for striking an officer of the law. Give me my... Man, you put that shit in my face. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. TUCKER: Coffee? Miranda Scott, Brandi Smith, and Sommer Harris... They felt your wrath. Why'd you kill 'em? I have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, you do, Paige. You sure do. Or should I call you P? I don't know what that is. You had no right coming to my place of business disturbing me with this nonsense. I haven't done anything. Oh, yes, you have, Paige. You sure have. You assaulted an officer. You resisted arrest. That's two things right there. That's enough to lock you up, I'd say. You have no idea what you're getting in the middle of. You cops are so ignorant. Well, why don't you enlighten me, Paige? I'm not saying anything more without my attorney present. Fine. You don't want to talk, I don't want to talk either. Just know that your fingerprints is really all I need, and you've been processed. So if I was you, I would start talking real, real fast before my ignorance leads me to find out something that you don't want me to find out. You think you're so smart, don't you? No? Officer Mitchell. Get her ass out of here. Lock her up someplace else. I need you to check the DNA on these lip prints. Okay. Give me a week, maybe less. - I give you a day. - A day? - A day. - [SIGHS] - A day, alright, a day. - 24. Alright, 24 hours. I got you man, alright. I have missed you so much. And I'm really sorry, you know that, right? Yeah. I know. Yeah, about the whole Paige thing. Mm, we don't even have to go there. No, no, yes, yes, I do. I have to go there. I am so sorry I wasn't honest with you. Yeah, well, look, that's in the past. Really, I just want to forget about it and move on. I made a promise to be honest with you, and I broke that promise. And I will never make that mistake again, ever. Oh, we don't have to worry about her anymore. Detective Tucker took care of it. He took care... What? Are you sure? Oh, my God. That is... That's great news, babe. Oh, my... we can actually just finally go back to the way things were before all this started. - Yeah. - Oh, my God, that's fantastic. [CELLPHONE RINGS] [SCOFFS] What? I thought you told me that this woman was taken care of? I'm sorry, Mrs. Taylor, but she was bailed out. What? Bailed out by who? By an anonymous source. We don't know. An anonymous source. This is absolutely insane. How in the world am I supposed to keep my wife safe from this psycho woman if you two won't help? Huh? Huh? I told you she was crazy, babe. She's crazy. What if Nicole was home alone? Huh? What then? She could have killed her, Detective. Is that what it's going to take, somebody else needs to die - before you do something? - Hey, you better relax, man. - Brian. - You'd better relax. - No, you relax. - Brian. Brian. You relax. Listen to me. If something happens to my wife, - man, I swear to God. - Yeah, put your hands down. You don't want to threaten an officer. - NICOLE: Stop. - Okay, alright. - Alright, okay. - NICOLE: Brian, stop. - I have this. - Okay. Alright. Look, you have her on our security cameras twice. We don't have proof that it was her the first time. She is clearly the one who is doing this. She's on camera. She's left notes with her initials on them. How much more proof do you need? All I can say is I'm doing the best I can. Well, your best is not good enough. You can leave now, Detective. Fine. We out of here. [SCOFFS] BRIAN: Come here. Come here. It's alright. MAN: I got some really interesting information. So we ran the DNA sample that you gave us. Turns out Paige Campbell isn't even her real name. It's Samantha Wells. That name mean anything to you? No. Not at all. 'Cause that's all the information I could dig up. I hope it helps. - Thanks. - Any time. Damn. Hey, I need your help getting a closed file. You think you can help me with that? I told a friend I'd be there to save her ass when the time came, and the time is now. Why should I trust you? Because I trust her. Okay. This is from Nicole. Hope you guys find what you're looking for. Damn. Samantha Wells is Peter Wells' sister? I never even knew he had a sister. Well, apparently nobody did. When Peter was a baby and Samantha was 3, Mr. and Mrs. Wells adopted them. [DOORBELL RINGS] [LAUGHING] I told him the same thing. Oh, hello, sir. May I help you? Hi, ma'am. I'm here for Samantha Wells. Officer, what's the problem? You're under arrest for the murders of Miranda Scott, Brandi Smith, and Sommer Harris. ELDA: What? What is this about? What is happening? I don't understand. Elda, don't say another word. Go back in the house and call the lawyer. Everything's going to be okay. But I don't understand what's going on here. A few days after the incident between you all and Peter Wells at the summer camp, Peter Wells committed suicide. A year later, Samantha's living on the streets, and she's there for a while, but she ended up back in the foster care system. But after that, no one heard of her until last year when she moved back to LA under the name of Paige Campbell. Oh, my God. She probably blamed us for her brother's death. Probably. Killing and trying to make it look like a suicide. She wanted you to know it was her. She wanted to take my husband away from me as payback. Listen. You said you and your friends played a joke on Peter? Who exactly was there? It was Miranda, Brandi, Sommer, and myself. TUCKER: You were going to be the fourth. - She was saving you for last. - ELDA: Officer! OFFICER: You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you by the court. Do you understand your rights? ELDA: I don't even know what precinct you're taking her to. Could you at least tell me that? Ma'am, please go back inside. Oh, this is just ridiculous! Ridiculous! I'm going to call somebody for you, baby. God, this is a nightmare. Well, the nightmare's over now, okay? We got Samantha. We good. She won't be hurting nobody no time soon. JUDGE ATWOOD: "We the jury find the defendant, Samantha Wells, on count one, first-degree murder of Miranda Scott, guilty. On count two, we the jury find the defendant, Samantha Wells, in the charge of murder in the first degree of Brandi Smith, guilty. On count three, we the jury find the defendant, Samantha Wells, in the charge of murder in the first degree of Sommer Harris, guilty." Samantha Wells, you have been found guilty on all counts. Sentencing will be at a later date. Court is adjourned. BAILIFF: All rise for the Honorable Judge Atwood. Congratulations. And I'm sorry for being such a jerk, man. It's just my wife's safety's the most important thing to me, you know? Nah, nah, nah, it's okay. I'm just happy y'all safe now. - Yeah. - Yeah, me too. Thank you, Detective. No, thank you. Thank you. You got it, man. There she is. You all ready to go, babe? - Bag is packed, face is on. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just have to put my dress on, and then I'm all yours. Oh, well, I made your favorite tea. - Aww. - Boom. Can you believe it? Four years ago, babe. I married the most beautiful woman in the entire world. - Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary. Mm. Well, guess what? - Hmm? - What? I have an entire night planned for you. And I know everything's been a bit of a train wreck lately, but just for tonight I want us to just forget about everything, focus on us. - I like that idea. - Mm. Drink up now. Drink it up. You need some energy for what we doing tonight. - Ooh? - Uh-huh. It's a surprise. I love surprises. ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ You can trust me ♪ ♪ Love is everlasting ♪ ♪ I know you don't trust me ♪ ♪ Promise I won't walk out... ♪ [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yeah? Oh, hey, Kenny. Okay. Sure. You got to be kidding me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] YOUNG WOMAN: Nicole? Nicole? Come out, come out wherever you are. Brian? Brian? YOUNG WOMAN: Nicole. Nicole, come out wherever you are. Come on. Come on. [GIGGLES] Come on. Come on. Come on. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hurry up, come on. [DOORBELL RINGING] Nicole! It's Detective Tucker! WOMAN: Hey! Hey! Hi! Is everything okay? I actually... I live next door. TUCKER: No, no, I'm looking for Brian and Nicole. Actually it's their anniversary, so they may be gone. Do you know where they are? You got me there. No, I don't, I'm sorry. Jesus. Damn it. Damn it. WOMAN: I hope everything's going to be okay. Geez. Come on. - Piggy Pete. - [LAUGHTER] Nicole? This is where I had my first kiss. It was with you. Peter. So, you figured it out. I don't understand. We were just kids. We didn't mean to hurt you. No. Don't act all innocent, Nicole. You... You guys, you know what you did out there. You know what you did to me. You killed me, Nicole, you and your little friends. Wait, this one, alright. Peter, wake up! Nicole's in trouble. - Come on, hurry. - I'm coming. - Nicole! Come on, let's go! - Come on, jump! - Come on, she's drowning! - Save her! - She's drowning! - She can't swim! Help! I can't swim! You guys, if he keeps shouting, we're saving him. We have to, Sommer, go get help now. Okay, okay. - I'm out of here. - PETER: Help! Brandi, we can't let him drown. Help me get him out of here. BRANDI: I'm sorry, Nicole. You're on your own. I cannot get in trouble for this. Don't leave me here. Peter! Peter, it's going to be okay. I'm sorry. Peter, grab my hand. I jumped in that water to save you, Nicole, and you let me drown. No. No, that's... That's not what happened. You have this all wrong. But you can't kill me. I'm... I was too strong. Yeah. He's still not breathing. We need to rush him to the ER. You stopped breathing, but you would have died if I didn't try to save you. You know I tried to kill myself that summer? Yeah. Samantha, she found me in the room. Alone, bleeding from my wrist. And our foster parents, they were... they were... they were going to put me away. [CHUCKLES] So she took me and we... we just... we ran. We ran away. And we were on the street alone for months before they found us again, and then back into the system we went, you know? Two kids, just nowhere to go. And that's... that's kind of when everything really just changed for us. - Elda. - BRIAN: Mm-hmm. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Oh, Elda. She was... She was so nice. She... She... She took us in, and we were... [CHUCKLES] She gave me a new name. And gave us new life, you know? Like, I really started to feel good about myself. And I was healing. [LAUGHS] Until that one day years later, I... I saw you, saw you, you and your... your... your friends just passing by me at your school and... That's when it hit me. I decided to make it my purpose to get my revenge. And I wasn't... Piggy Pete anymore. I was Brian Taylor. How is this possible? BRIAN: How is it possible? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it was... it was so easy. I was there the whole entire time, you know, throughout high school, college. You just can't even notice me. The entire time. I-I-I just followed you. I knew your every move better than you did. I knew you'd message me back, I knew what to say, I knew exactly what you wanted to hear, Nicole, what you needed to hear. And then we met again. For the first time. [CHUCKLES] A-And now, you know, I went through so much. Things a-a-a child should never have to experience. All because of you. You, Brandi, and Miranda, and Sommer. And they all got what the deserved. Now it's your turn. [CHOKING] [SCREAMING] [COUGHS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] BRIAN: Nicole! [PANTING] Doesn't have to end like this. We could start a new life, Nicole. I love you. I... Nicole, where are... Nicole! Nicole! - [SCREAMS] - Oh! Hey. Hey, Nicole. It's... It's me. It's me, Peter. Do you remember? Huh? Yeah, you remember. You s... You saved me once. Yeah. Now, who's... who's... who's going to save you? Brian. Peter. Don't do this. Don't... Don't do this? Don't... You know that I've... I've been... I've been waiting all these years for... for today. This exact moment. This very moment. Always and forever, baby. [PANTING] [GASPING] Peter, please. - [GUNSHOT] - [SCREAMS] [CRYING] Nicole. Are you okay? NICOLE: Yeah. TUCKER: Need you to check on her. Always... And forever. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING]
