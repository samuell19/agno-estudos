No-one's gonna hurt you again, 'cuz, they hurt you... I'll kill 'em. You're like a son to me. And I want you to think of me, like your father. Thanks. Are you sure you want to suffer? Yes. I'm sure. Why? Did anything change? Yes. What did? Come, drive me... across the island, like only you can. I want to feel light, and fly away. I've been waiting here forever. I had to walk all the way back! Where were you? Where the hell were you? - Come on... To get gas? From a whore? Where the fuck were you? What do you want from me? I want to know where you were. I've been waiting for you. A body washed up ashore. It floated like it was dead. Lifeless. The Sheriff brought it in on a mule. Yes. The Sheriff is my brother. Yes. Then there's another thing... it could be that the man is still alive. The Sheriff... he started to cry. Just give me the money and shut up. It's always the same with you. I come too quickly. I just come too fast. I really want to fuck you, but I just come too fast. That's your problem, not mine. You have to be sweeter to me. Why don't you be sweeter! You have to be sweet to me, darling. You have to be sweeter to me, darling. Be sweet yourself. I want a special treatment. Special treatments will cost you more roses. It's always the roses, all you do is talk about flowers. Yeah, if only you were more like them. You're too beautiful. You're just too beautiful! I want to fuck you. But, you're just too beautiful. THE AWAKENING OF KASPAR HAUSER I am Kaspar Hauser. I am Kaspar Hauser! Hey, Hauser. Hey, buddy. Are you hungry? Shit... I don't got much to eat here. I'll go get you some bread 'n water. Better... you don't make too much noise. Don't want anyone to hear ya', know what I mean? ON THE MULE Yeah, nice day. How's my little buddy today? Become a knight! Hey Kaspar? D'you like this, boy? Real pretty, ain't she? That's a boy, like you Kaspar. Ya' see, my friend, that's Kaspar Hauser. Come on, come to see it! Okay, Tonino? You remember Kaspar? We took'm back together, yeah. I want you to meet my good buddy. Come on Kaspar, take a look. Don't be afraid, buddy. You can touch him, real gentle, boy... You like the mule? Yeah, he's nice, right? Hey, I think he loves you, boy! You wanna ride'm? Are you afraid, or no? Okay, now listen... it's a mule. Not a horse. Did you know that? Mules ain't easy to ride, you gotta be careful! Get on slow! There you go! Be gentle. That's my friend. Settle down. This is a mule, man, you gotta be careful! Okay Tonino, you can take 'em. Go ahead! You two have fun! You look good, boy! You look like a cowboy! All right, have fun! Be careful! Shit! Kaspar ridin' a mule! Goddamn! THE HERMIT PRIEST Hello Servant. Hi. What are you doing? I'd like to play soccer, but I'm alone. Kick it over, then. Again. I have always dreamt of being a pro. But... but... that takes a lot of will. Sure. What about you, Drago... What are you good at? I'm just a servant, That's what I can do. Thankfully, it's good to serve, it keeps you sane. There's nothing worse than having a head full of fancy. Whim-whams are bad. Priest, do you have whims? A couple, yes. Drago has them as well. That's why I became a priest. To calm the whims, before they become really lively, a bit too fierce. Watch it. How bad are your whims, then? They're big. - Really? - Enormous. - I don't believe it. - It's scary, sometimes. Let's talk about something else. That's too bad for you. Say, you always know about all the shit that goes on around here, do you know if any new people showed up on the island recently? I shouldn't tell you, really, but I believe so. Tell me, Servant... do you know who they are? I'm not really sure, but I think somebody new came. Bye, Servant. That's good. He had fun! - He rides well, right? - Yes, he's very good at it. Good. You had fun, huh, buddy? A little too much fun! Well, you rest up, buddy. You rest right here now, okay? Yeah. Get some sleep. You did good. You did real good, yeah... THE EDUCATION OF KASPAR What should I wear, chief? Well... The white underwear. The red... red pants there and your blue Adidas jacket, there. How do you know, chief? Well, I reckon... I must be some kind of clairvoyant, or something. Go ahead, put it on. I go walk... Put your pants on first. You walk around without your pants on, people think ya' crazy, yeah. Hi, Sheriff. Hello Priest. Hi, Sheriff. What brings you here? I'm here to see the boy. Well... the boy's sleepin' right now. Yeah, sleepin'. Then why are you leaving? Well, I wasn't, as a fact... I wanted to get some air off my belt, you know. You know how it is. Yeah, I know... It's always good for the belly to take some air, eh? Right? So, Priest... anything new and exciting happening? You got any gossip for me? Come on now... You know somethin' to tell me... something exciting is going on! Sheriff... No, nothing new. You know, hardly something happens here. Then I guess I'd better get goin'. Do me a favour, now. Keep an eye on the boy, yeah. Don't worry, Sheriff. Don't you worry! He's in good hands! Surely you... You surely must have something to tell, infamous one. You are infamous, because you are not famous. Your reputation precedes you and as soon as you are here, your renown disappears. This world is not a joke, Kaspar Hauser. Before you can let others see through their blindness, you first have to become a blind one yourself. Only then all will be clear. Very clear. Gloriously clear. You ask me why I have faith? That's not the right question. You always ask the wrong questions, because you have no sense for words. You don't believe in anything and you're right, you're right about that. What faith does a plant have? Isn't a plant alive, like us? What do you think? That plants do not have a conscience? They sleep, but they never dream, what? What are your dreams, Kaspar Hauser? You don't have dreams. My dream? You want to know, what I dream of... my dream is the one to end all dreams. And the people call it "God". Only the people here don't. Maybe you think this is an island? This is not an island. There are no islands here. Here is neither inside, or outside... and the name Kaspar Hauser is a legion. A strange legion, a legion of strangers. But when there's no in- or outside, where could a stranger come from? Do you know why you are being followed, Kaspar Hauser? You sleep the sleep of the righteous, because you have forgotten, how it is to be alive. We always forget this, and then we forget to enjoy life. We loose the taste for it. And so... listen to this... they have... invented... another life. How can there ever be another life? Everything simply happens here... and now. Listen to me, Kaspar Hauser: I love you. Your lips, your eyelashes, Where do you come from? Your skin is so soft. The light, it bothers you and I disturb you. too. I am the darkness. Let me kiss your feet, Kaspar Hauser. You said that you would return, and you have kept your promise. But where have you been? When there's nothing beyond here? Kiss me... and bless this poor servant of the Lord. I dreamt about the hero, who would come to deliver us from evil. Illuminated, on a beautiful horse. Do you know what I have done? In the Holy Mother's name, bless only me. There's no Pope here, no priests, no holy Fathers. There are only poppers here and we like them a lot. We have a queen but we don't have a King and no cracked-up boy. Kaspar Hauser... is everywhere! Kaspar Hauser... will drug them all! Look at this guy! A beautiful boy... Kaspar Hauser. Is something wrong? What's with the question, there's always something wrong. Take me away from here. I can't. Why not? Let's go! Take me to another island, if you dare. All the islands are the same. How would you know? I just know. "I pray to God, the God of the sun and moon. "So I will see and understand, "and will submit to all the senses, "that I have. " Take me to see this boy. That's not possible. Only the Duchess is allowed to see the boy. Then take me back to the island. Kaspar... I just got a call from the Duchess. She wants to come by here, boy. Take a visit here, with us. That means... you gotta go in the cage, while she's here! So you got to lock yourself up in there, allright? Looks better if she comes here, when you're in the cage, you know. ...'cuz I don't trust her. Sorry 'bout that, boy. Go in there 'n lock yourself up, okay? Don't be scared now, I'm right here. I'll let you out, as soon as she leaves. Play with your wooden pony and be a good boy. Make sure you stay in there, while she's here, okay? Sorry 'bout that. Be a good boy. Be a good boy. He can do some different things, very special. He can juggle... Oranges. Hauser, can you show her? - Yeah, look at that. - Oh, that's good. That's special. Yeah, he can also... he does a thing, like a sit-up. Kaspar, can you show her the thing? Watch it. Like a sit-up, but crusted and a little more... Something special. He can do this thing where he bangs his head right against the wall, and he doesn't get hurt. Watch this. - Oh my God! Kaspar, do the 'Headbanger'. He can go harder. Watch this. Look at that. He doesn't get hurt. Nah, he's not hurt, don't worry. Look at that. Don't go too hard, Kaspar! - He's very talented. - Yeah. He's a special boy. Okay Kaspar, that's good. You okay, Kaspar? Hey boy, 'r you okay? Very well... It's precisely the jester like I had in mind. Yeah, he's special. But that's not all. I'd like to see some more. I will come back. Come on, Kaspar. Let's get somethin' to eat. Come on! I got some bread 'n water for ya'. I got some wine for you, Duchess. Made it myself. ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE PEOPLE Test! One, two, test. People,... and dogs. Listen. The committee of orderly maintenance on the island says... that today our Duchess has witnessed with her very own eyes, how the man who came from the sea, whom we name Kaspar Hauser... is an impostor. According to the Duchess, he is neither our heir apparent, who has disappeared for long. Nor is he a prophet, nor... an idiot. He simply is a fraud. A fraud, who we... of whom... we understand... we don't understand... What strange... circumstances brought... brought him to us from the sea, alive and well. That's it. Sound of trumpet... THE KING DANCES THE SHERIFF TEACHES KASPAR THE SKILLS OF A DEEJAY Tonino... can you help me, get this in here? Yes. Moving house uphill, or? Yeah, load the van here. No horse? Kaspar... I told ya' yesterday. This is a mule, not a horse. That's a mule, allright? Say "mule"... Yeah, mule. Come on, let's go now. And we're not taking the mule, allright? We're takin' the van. - That van. - Van. We're takin' the van. - Van. - Right. Maybe you can help out here. Lift somethin', yeah! You know, Kaspar... You know... a long time ago... I used to make a living, being the sheriff in this town here, Kaspar. Did you know that? But... you see, this town now, not many people around here anymore and so there's no work. So... Tonino, can you help me? We got it, okay! Today I'm gonna teach 'ya how to make a living, boy. ...'cuz you're old now. You've grown up. It's time you learn how to make a livin', yeah. Come on Tonino, let's get this one now! Kaspar, we're going in the van, so get in the van! - Van? - Yeah, get inside boy! - Van? - Get inside. Come on! Everybody! Listen to me! Okay, we're gonna repeat. We're gonna repeat the same thing, now. Before, whenever you come, you get your generator, right here. This is your generator. Put a few litres of petrol in the generator, otherwise you got no electricity. Okay, don't forget. Then you you come over here. Yeah, come right here. Put your table down, and put your turntables on your table. Put 'em on the table. Put your speakers nearby. Kaspar, this is a beach. The beach's got sand. Don't put your speakers on he sand, don't do that. You gotta take cover from the wind. Hey, you feel that wind? Just gonna blow everything all over the place. Gotta protect yourself, protect yourself from the wind. Okay? Then you can start the music. Kaspar, now listen, look at this, see? That's your mixer, that's your friend. I'm your best friend, but that's my second-best friend. Get to know it. Look here. Volume. Volume! You got ya' EQ... got your FADE, 'n ya' PAN. Go left. Go right. Go left! Go right! That's right, you saw. Play the music. Yeah! Now... a dancing fool! Hell yeah! Yo' the dancing knight! I AM Kaspar Hauser. Hey, Kaspar. Listen up. You are on the swing? Very good. Oomph, oomph, oomph! Finally, I see you lively. The last time I saw you, you were silently asleep. Do you have a nice story for me? Oomph, oomph, oomph... I am Kaspar Hauser! Okay, "oomph, oomph". I think I believe you. Luckily I am a priest with a vision. So, tell me... instead of "choow-choow", who are you, really? I am Kaspar Hauser. Okay, I got that. You are really special, of a special kind, Kaspar Hauser. I always knew that most saints are a bit strange. They are a bit weird, with their "oomph, oomph" vibe. No-one of them is normal. What do you say? Don't you think I'm right? I am Kaspar Hauser. Okay. Since you came from the sea, and you were doing well there. Why did you return to the land? What will you do? I want to be a knight. Ah, you answer. That means you understood. What is your mission? Are you looking for gold, maybe? Tell me. Then I can work with you. Like my father! Like my Father. This must be some sort of code, a sacred message. I like you, Kaspar. You're a bit strange but I like that. There's a lot to question about you, but I like that. Now, listen here... when you are finished here, where will you go next? I... Am. "I am", he just said: "I am"! Stripped of all nonsense, those are true words. It's the vibes of "I am". It's the vibes that say "I am". The simplest words you can say, and they are perfect. "I am" You truly are a heavenly being. Goodbye. Goodbye, Kaspar. Play, play on... play and fly and be light, because you really are... You really are the best. You won! I am Kaspar Hauser. THE MIRACLE OF KASPAR Ladies and gentlemen, the Duchess. Duchess. You can come. Okay, Kaspar. Today there's only discreet eyes looking on, so you can... really demonstrate all you can do. Rumour has it, you possess some powers unheard of... it is these that interest me, and today I wish to see them. Shoo. Stop this awful scene! I'm not interested in you playing the jester. We have more than enough of them. Duchess, the cans are ready. Very good. Get ready. Who knows what he just did there? A miracle? Get ready! Now is your turn... THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KASPAR HAUSER I want to write my biography. I want to write my biography. I want to write my biography! I want to write my biography. Excuse me, do you really want to write your own biography? Yes, yes, yes, its title will be... "I want to be a knight, just like my daddy. " Could you repeat that title, please? "I want to be a knight, just like my daddy. " I have to take this down, so I can report to the Duchess "I want to be a knight, just like my daddy. " Could you repeat that title, one more time, please? "I want to be a knight, just like my daddy. " I have to report to the Duchess. Could you repeat that title, please? So I can report to the Duchess. "I want to be a knight, just like my daddy. " Thank you, very much. Listen to this for a bit... Kaspar said he'd like to write his biography. Its title will be: "I Want to... ... Be Like... My Daddy's Horse". Yes, Duchess. He's going to write his biography, it will be named... "To Become a Horse"... Okay. That Kaspar's some guy, huh? This island could use a guy like him, yeah. Good deejay, right? He'll have everybody dancing'. And whore, how're you doin'? Rumour has it, you're doin' real well. 'Well' is a big word. I'd rather not talk about it. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't. Things are too personal, yeah. And you, Sheriff... how are you? I'm gettin' by, yeah. Hi. White helmeted man! Today Kaspar Hauser, who thought himself to be King, has died. But we already have a queen. The Duchess cannot be fooled. This boy was a fraud, a swindler and a crook. He wasn't a saint, but just a very troubled boy. And this is how the legend of his troubled soul ends. Kaspar Hauser is not a king. Kaspar Hauser is not our King. KASPAR IN HEAVEN Got's the Deejay stuff right up here. Come on, let's go look at it. Yeah, get loose!. Got to stretch a little before you dance. I showed you everything.
