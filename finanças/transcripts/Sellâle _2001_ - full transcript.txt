To Sehra THE WATERFALL Dreams are told to flowing water and... Joseph the prophet interprets them, my girl. Tell your dream to the waterfall. I dreamed of god, mommy. He was pure white and naked. We flew over cotton clouds and came to heaven. There were doves flying around. I realized I also had wings, just like the doves. I was very haPPY~ I've been having the same dream for years, mom... But dreams are told to flowing water and their commenter is Joseph the prophet, right'? I don't like my paintings anymore. I want to go back. Back to the town of Antiocus where I lost Daphne. Back to the waterfall, to tell my dreams to Daphne's eyes. Master Selim...It's me... Right, master Selim. Shall I do the shave'? No son, I'm coming. We sent the French off and less than ten years later... ...they bring Uncle Sam upon us. Who the hell is he, man! Ha'? When the French were here, black men were handing out white bread... - Did you not get bread from them? - When'? -What do you mean when, you fool'? -If you say so, I must have. Of course you have, fool! Folks were stepping on each other just for a loaf of bread. And not a single sould was there to ask the occupiers: Who the hell are you'? Now this Uncle Sam hands out flour, milk powder and cotton oil. Then he sent thousands to Korea and had them fight the Asians. Do you drink that damn American milk, Cemal? Good. Don't you ever drink that thing! And if you ever do, throw it up like this. Damn, I almost did throw up. So, you think Uncle Sam sends us that donkey milk for love'? They make the donkey milk into powder... ...and they force it on our kids at school. And what happens when you drink donkey's milk? You turn into a donkey! And if it's mixed with horse milk, a mule. One does not need a saddle on his back to be a donkey! - You got that right. - Uncle Sam is crafty. Turned our schools into a donkey factory! Soon every neighborhood will have a stud farm. Heyy, eat the meat, but not the share of infants! Callud doesni eat the share of infants, but likes their mamas. Well, Cemal, draw the picture of a donkey here. So we'll know that they will be all over the place in twenty years. Right, master... Heeeey, stop! I will kill you! What's going on here'? Suleyman asked us to separate the courtyard. This wall will be put up whether you like it or not! You gonna build it in the middle of my house, bastard'? Our father had marked the yard right here. There's something called a title deed, you fool! So you're raising your hand against your elder now'? You rascal! Was it the People's Party who taught you to oppose elders'? Don't you utter the name of People's Party, you sell-out! I'm the sell-out'? You ungrateful bastard! Democrat Party is feeding you with bones. The bones are for you, bastard! -I don't have a brother anymore! -Oh, I'm shattered... Those damn communists are gonna run the land with a dictatorship. These rascals here don't care for democracy. It ain't democracy, it's The Iron Podium! You're all servants to the Americans! Thousands were killed in Korea for two bowls of milk! I'm ready to die for this country but what do we care... ...about the tribe of Asians from beyond the Caucasus. Suleyman, enough already. You might later regret what you're saying now. So it's your turn to preach now, you bitch? Uncle! Come down here! I see your beard has grown. I do you a nice shave, ha'? - Won't do. I'm gonna grow a beard. - It's your call. Have a nice day. Have a nice day. - Coffee with sugar, Suleyman'? - No want... - Here have mine, brother. - This doesn't have any bubbles. Drink it now! We got no water left. I gotta sharpen Sergeant Mikdat's razor. What happened, my girl? It's only Cemal. You scared me, you donkey! I'll show you something. But don't tell anyone, OK? Right. Watch for the pits. - It's too dark. I can't see. - Hang on, you soon will. Someone in there shouts back whatever I say. Master Seliim. - It's your turn. - You donkeeey! Don't talk like that. The man might get pissed off and grab you. We can go now. Mommy! Don't worry, the doves won't eat you. Look, this is the god of the ancient ones... So this is god'? - Yeah, but the ancient ones'... - So where is ours'? I dunno, in the skies maybe. One day I'll also make people out of stone... ...and they will never die, just like this one. Brother, let's you and I marry. I'll help you out, and you'll buy me some shoes. Don't be crazy. We are brothers and sisters! What are you laughing at, fool! Be a good girl. Let's go... MOm! You little bitch. Turning up like this like a genie. God knows you must have made fire. You'll get yourself burned. - Mommy...| saw god. - Is that so, dear? Now you head back home, catch up with your brother. They left early today. Let me take a look inside. - Brother, can I come too? - OK ! Oh, the mill I Look, there's grain on the floor. Shall we plant it in our garden? Nope. Better to just give it to the beggars. But this is not flour. We'll grind it and it will become flour. - How will you turn the mill, Cemal? - The water will, not me... - So the water is stronger than man? - Sure, what did you think? - It's stronger than Dad, too? - Yeah... - How about Ataturk? - Stronger than all men! How about god'? Wait here, I'll go and get the water flowing. Brother, look! We're in trouble. What happened, Cemal? It didn't turn into flour? The stones are giving out the smell. Don't tell anyone we came to the mill, OK? Let's go. Never saw, nor heard, nor had any knowledge about it. |sn't it crazy to let him get married? They thought that marriage would cure him. Yeah, one can tell he's been cured very well. So what am I swearing for'? Someone started up the mill and the stones have grinded each other. If I have the slightest connection... ...or if I know who it was, may god clutter my chimney... Alright, alright, stop it! Hello Cemal! Do you want to swear, too? All right. So long. You lie, and then you swear ha'? You son of a pig! - I'm not lying, teacher! - Shut up, you rascal! I already had milk at home in the morning, teacher. Is that so'? Good for you, my daughter. Open up now. Now piss off! - Mine didn't hurt at all. - Oh yeah'? - Why aren't you drinking? - It's too hot, sir. It's not even warm! No games here I Didn't I say no games, you donkey! Open up! - Mom! - Don't be afraid, son. I'm right here. - Here, drink this. - No, it's got bugs inside! It's only a nightmare. Drink a bit more, my bright boy. Seyh Effendi. My boy has nightmares. If you could recite a few verses... It will be done. Calm down, woman. Why did you tie this little boy up'? Untie him now, or you'll be cursed in this holy place! If I hadn't tied him up, I couldn't have brought him here. Poor thing! An evil demon has taken hold of him. - What's your name, boy? - What's your name boy! Don't hit him, woman! There's no place for evil in here! Don't worry, he'll be like a lamb. Don't spit, man! I said don't hit him, woman! Mamaaa! He's spitting on my face! Don't hit him, be patient. He'll soon be like a lamb. - Don't spit, man! - Calm down! Don't hit him. You son of the devil! You infidel's bastard! Heyy, the infidel's sheikh is killing my son! What's with this weak applause? Louder! Welcome to our town, Efendis. My fellow citizens! With the help of God, our friend America, and our dear prime minister... from now on, there will be no unemployment. We have here Mister Johnson, master engineer... who came all the way from America to build us a factory! With the industrialization drive we have started... ...we are going to turn our land into a miniature America! Now, let's put the first stake for our factory. Hurry up, bring the stakes! Come here! Zuhtu! Bring a glass of coffee for Haydar, it's on me. I won't take no for an answer, you have to drink my coffee. - How are you doing 7 - Fine, thanks. What's going on brother? You hold out your hand and you lose your whole arm. You have no right to talk! How much did your father give... ...the Ottomans to avoid the draft when we fought in the deserts'? So what? He had it, so he gave it. May god be my witness, there wasn't a house left that... ...he hadn't entered through the chimney and burglarized. I tell him a factory is being built and he star-ts telling me all this. There's no factory being built, shit head! First the stadium will be built and then you'll see the factory. After all, it was never our party who fooled people. Shame on you! Does one man's injustice justify anothefls? What is this stadium business anyways? - Have a good shave, Yusuf Usta! - Thanks, brother... You are a man who's seen two world wars Master Selim. Conquests are no longer made through guns and powder. That's right. Now it's with donkey milk and pork salami. My brother, conquests are made through sports now. - You know the saying. - What saying? A strong mind comes with a strong body. Is that why Uncle Sam smoked the Japanese'? And did we go to Korea just to play ball with the Asians? That's something else. The Americans were doing their humanitarian duty against communism. - Would we know better than them? - We only know our own place! Would it be better if the State took away our kids... ...and had them eat from the same bowl and dress the same clothes 7 - Do you really believe these things? - Why not'? Do you think the newpapers are falsely accusing the Bolsheviks? Yeah, would newspapers ever do such a thing. And the radios, could they be lying? Radios tell the truth but only some of them. Shall I mop the floor, master'? No, it's allright, my boy. ...this morning the second rocket was launched... ...it carries a dog named Laika... There's a campaign to the skies! We will conquer the sun! They will make it, Cemal, they will conquer the skies. Zuhtu! Give Cemal a soda! All right, son. Let's drink for Laika. - Who's that, master'? - Who's who? Who we're drinking for... Oh, Laika! A Soviet dog who conquered the universe! So the dog flies a plane? No. They put her on to a rocket and fired it up. Why don't they send a man? That's next, son. A new age is beginning. How I wish I were a kid your age! You know who this is, Cemal? It's Stalin, son. Joseph Stalin! Don't tell anyone I showed you this, OK? -Who is a communist, master Selim? -A communist? How can I explain'? He's just a normal man, son. Are you a communist, master'? I am a student, Cemal. Just like you. - Come on now, go home. - Have a good evening, master. Nazli, girl, turn off that radio, I have a headache. Nazli! Come on, darling. Fetch the jug for me. - It's my turn now. - Hold on, I just saw one. - Hey, I'm talking to you. - I saw it! I swear I saw it! You little bitch! Look, your sister brought the jug. So what? She's big as a donkey now. Cut out the foul language! Uncle! Come down here! You'll fall down, girl. Dad, the Russians have gone off to the skies! All of them? - No, just this dog named Laika. - Damn, that's a pity. I wish their whole lot had gone off... ...and taken the People's Party folks with them. You're just like the Ottomans, no real work... ...but still taking a share of the food. What are you looking at'? What's the boy got to do with the Ottomans? You break his heart for nothing. So, now you're a Democrat like your foolish father, ha'? A revolt, is it? You bastards! Suleyman, stop it! You should stop fooling with Suleyman. When he gets pissed off, he beats up the kids. Never laughed so hard my whole life. I didn't say anything bad. - But you knew he'd be mad. - Well, he shouldn't be. It's not easy for him. He's been off work for months now. Our situation is not much better. Sehra's shoes wore off. She is walking around with bare feet. You think I don't know? We've been waiting for months for our salaries. The contractor does not receive his allowance. The government is in trouble with the Americans cutting off the aid. What's even worse, the military doesn't support the cabinet anymore. It's only five liras, tops. When I see her like that, I feel terrible. The other day, God took her to heaven in her dream. I'm worried something will happen to her. Ok! I'll buy her shoes with the first money I receive. Count your steps! Stop! Turn towards the wall now and listen to me. - What do we call this'? - Awalll. My stupid children! Aren't they mosaics? Yes, ma'am! Good. These mosaics prove that our town has hosted a big civilization... ...2000 years ago. Quiet! Now on to the next room. Hey! You can't touch the sculptures. - What is this, children? - A sarcophagus! Good. In the past, kings and... ...rich men were buried in these sarcophagi with their belongings. Quiet! This cave is the first church in the world. St. Pierre and St. Barnabas... - Hey, what's going on'? - He's hitting me. Turn around!!! And so the saints came here. Hatice, will you be my friend? Stop the murmur! All these will be in the exam. The followers of Jesus were named Christians here for the first time. Will you be my friend? Cemal! So who do we call Christians? The dead men, teacher? Good. - What's that in your hand'? - Look what I found, teacher. - Meryem. - Shut up! What do you want? Shall we be friends? I'll tell you what I saw. Cemal, I can be your friend. Piss off! Come on, kids! We're off. Doesn't it hurt when the chickens' heads are cut off? Don't look. Stop, I said, stop right therel. I'll sacrifice a goat for whoever stops her! Hey, you touch my wife, ha'? You rascal! Sami, stop! I just wanted to help, don't do itl. Have I fallen so low that I need your help? You son of a bitch! Shall I cut your head off? Don't do it, Samil. Stop, I said. Stopl. - Brother, what if they see us? - Sssht, be quiet. Wait here. Let's see what Habip will do. - What will he do'? - How would I know. Let's go. What's up Habip, what happened'? Someone emptied out the coop last night. You have to swear on the Kur'an. For tradition's sake. For the sake of this Kur'an, never saw, nor heard nor do I know. Here they go with the swearing business again. -Apparently they stole some chicks. -Prepare to swear, now. Good day. Someone has completely emptied out the coop. You think we would steal chicks from the coop'? I know you haven't, but just for tradition's sake. What tradition? Let the thieves do the swearing I So we're thieves now, since we swore? You shouldn't have. Who forced you to? It's just swearing. It's another thing if you're afraid of being cursed. What's up with you, Hasibe? Would we ever steal chicks? We were accused for nothing. It's OK, sister Hasibe, you only swear if you wish. Everyone's walking around with a Kur'an in his hands these days... - I should swear, too. - You don't have to, we believe you. If a single feather entered my home... ...if I have the slightest connection,.. ...may god clutter my chimney. All right, all right! There's not a single proper man in this town. I don't care! I stole them! -I made appetizers out of them. -Why didn't you share with me? It's was me. I did it! Enough already. Calm down, I'll buy you some coffee. Buy it for Habip! You should have seen what Habip did when Cemile refused to swear. - Oh yeah, what did he do'? - Ask Cemile. Goddamn donkey, ate up all the cucumbers! Here, have it all! Suleyman, that's not nice. Our fathers were friends. So the son of your father's friend steals chicks, Munir Agha'? In the past, who could ever oppose a landlord? Cemal, my boy, go get some water. Munir Agha, times are changing. Our folks are ungrateful! Could strangers steal the chicks? Wouldn't we know if one of our own did it? How would we know? No use in swearing anymore. If it were up to me, I'd just take them to the police station... ...and spank the whole lot of them. I thought you were a man of conscience I If they haven't deserved it yet, they sure will some day. That's true, Munir Agha. Check out the calf! It's like a baby deer, man! Master, shall I reserve his balls for you'? You fool! Hadn't you slaughtered this one last week'? No. This is the twin brother. Yeah, I guess a brother of the donkey kindl. So, such is lifetime sometimes raises a man up to the clouds... ...and sometimes it buries him down under. You're right, master Selim, we're in deep shit. I cut off some news for you. It's in my pocket. - I'll go up from here. - And I from here. You haven't changed a bit. - You remember that day'? - How can I forget'? We did not stand a chance against you if we got into firing. Say it in French, Jemal. Isabelle, Yusuf saved my life. That's how we met each other. Actually, we got to know each other in prison. If he hadn't helped, I'd have been executed. And I owe my life to you. We're even. - What's going on'? - Never laughed so hard before. - Good evening, Yusuf. - Good evening. Bring me a chair, son. How are you, Cemal? I forgot to tip you today! Here, don't be shy, take it. Everyone was talking about you today. Did you hear what came upon us? Some wise ass steals a few chicks, lets loose all the rest into the forest. What a bright thief I I just want to know why he let all of them loose. - I know. - You know what? - I know who let the chicks free. - Who'? - Me. - You! Allah Allah. Why'? So that Habip won't cut their heads off. Enough with this chicken talk. Let's drink! Jemal should study in France, Yusuf Usta. Let's light up some cigars. - No, I want this one. - Here you go. My fellow citizens! With the help of God... ...our friend America... ...and our dear prime minister,.. ...with the industrialization we started... ...we provided the remote villages with drinking water. Let our dam bring fortunes to us all! - What's going on'? Is it ready? - Yeah. Fire it up. Everyone is waiting. Run, fool, runl. What the hell is going on'? What do you think is going on, fool'? So you think you know it better than them? Didnt I tell you that this land is gonna turn... ...into a donkey's paradise! You fools! How could they dynamite Daphne's eyes? Didn't uncle Sam's engineers know... ...that the rock would break and swallow all the water'? You'll see, soon you'll have to buy your water at the grocery. If this doesn't happen, come and find me! Have a nice day. What's wrong, master Selim? The rat falls down the roof and it's the cat who arrives for help. That's not fair, master Selim! You have to know your limits. You see'? Those who are ruling this land are into total mischief. You continue to talk like that you'll be sent to exile. Ey, followers of Muhammad! Look at this fool threatening me! Get inside, I said! Where the hell is the cat'? Our cat is also lost auntie. - Mom, I can't find her! - She'll come when she's hungry. Good evening. - You're early tonight. - Good evening, zerife. - Welcome Serif e. - Forgive me Semra. Did you see my cat'? Ours has also been gone for two days. Welcome Serif e, what's up'? - Did you see my cat'? - Don't worry, Serif e. She'll come back by herself. If that Democrat cat comes here, I'll skin it. Shame on you. Can a cat be a Democrat'? You think those fools' cat sides with the People's Party'? Where are the kids'? Cemal! - Where have you been, girl? - They were going to the waterfall. - Don't lie, you mischief! - You're the liar! Shut up, girl! Dad, they've blown up the waterfall. - Bon appetit I - Thanks, brother! Come join us. No thanks. Did you hear, they dynamited the water's source. Even the deaf man has heard that. Fools! See now, the beautiful waterfall is gone. Has it gone completely dry'? Yes, almost completely dry. Please, come and join us. OK! If you insist... Also they have beaten whoever raised his voice about it. Really! Yeah... Those Democrats. They steal, get bribes. And they'll shut you up if you raise your voice. You got that right. Please, don't get upset. Why aren't you eating yoghurt? Hey, I'm talking to you. I won't eat yoghurt made of donkey milk. Donkey milk, ha'? It's OK, son. Nazli, warm up some water. It's OK, I'll stay like this. Not even lsmet Pasha can save them! Don't you say? You'll see, there'll be many people who will go down. Who will go down, you fool'? Tell him to stop barking. You bastard! I'll show you what's barking! Come over here. Suleyman! Let go of that ladder! Enough! Brother, won't we keep telling our dreams to the waterfall? What's the use, now that it's dry'? What are we gonna do now'? Dunno! Maybe we won't dream anymore. - Not at all'? - Maybe. In my dreams, I always fly. I saw Stalin in my dream. Who's this Stalin, brother? I dunno... master Selim's brother in arms, I think. Master Selim loves him. What will happen to us if we can't dream anymore'? Maybe some day we'll just die off. Children will die if they don't dream. You're scared'? Don't be. Maybe we won't die. Let's go, it's time for the spring festival. Selim Usta says that this festival actually belongs to the coal miners. I wish I was a boy. I would also learn all these things. There he is. Master Selim! Heyyt! Cheers! Don't run, you bitch! Stop, I said! Get in line! I said get in line! Get in line! Salih, start giving milk. Quiet! Stop moving, little donkeys! Why don't you drink the damn milk, son of a fool! How was it, did it hurt? No it didn't, teacher. Oh, really'? All right, open them up again. How about now'? I swear I'll beat you till you cry. How was that? It's enough, sir principal! You have not right to beat these kids! Now I realize why you have been exiled here. I'm glad! You can't beat the kids just because they don't drink milk. So you're threatening me, you infidel! They had told me you were a communist. Does one become a communist by opposing beatings? I'm against it, too! You too, Nihal'? I'll have you exiled as well. It's an honour to serve anywhere in our precious land! Those who don't want to drink the milk can get out of line! I'll break the neck of whoever leaves the line! Nobody can touch you, don't be afraid! -Oh, really'? You'll regret this. -He's totally crazy. You little donkey. Stop! Kemalettin Bey! Catch him, there he is, Cemal! Hello! Connect me to the Police immediately! Hello, lieutenant! There's a revolt at the school. Send the gendarmes, quick! Sorry, master Selim, I cant give you this. It was my father's. I don't have enough breath for this. Give me that one. - I can't. They were my father's. - Then, give me this one. They are all from my father. He collected them all from far away. From the banks of the river right here! No, there are no such bamboos here. - Give me this one, then. - That too, my father's... Sorry. This one then. - Hello! - Hello, soldiers. This sounds like the bag-pipes from my home. Yeah, I played a lot of bag-pipes. Kurdish, Greek, Albanian. So the only thing you have left is a water-pipe! You played all'? - Why did we come here anyways? - How the hell would I know? Stand still, or I'll shoot! Lieutenanfs orders. We're gonna search the place. There's nothing here. It's the orders. - Who is this Mr. Thick Moustache? - Oh, him? He's my lieutenant from the war. - What's his name? - Abdulrezzak! -Is this homemade booze 7 - I use it in place of grain alcohol. What's with these bones? Don't you dare touch them! What happened, uncle'? These bones belong to his son. He found them when he returned from the war. He wants us to bury these with him when he dies. Here, master Selim. This flute is yours. Hold it tight. The horseshoes get damaged because of the asphalt. - Get out! There's a search. - All right. Go and search. Are you a blacksmith or a butcher'? I swear, I wasn't slaughtering it.. I bet the rat is Selim. Bastard! One bag of soil for every two bags of grain. That's too much, mayor! Shut up! I know this business better than you I Hello! You're coming to the station with us, mayor! All right. You go, I'll be right there... It's the orders. You're coming now! What are you saying, man? I'm the mayor! So what? You two, you're coming as well! Okay, okay. I bet the rat is that Moscowite bastard Selim. Hurry up! Don't worry, we have the Democrat Party behind us. - How are you soldiers? - Fine thanks. Stop! We'll search you. You have anything in here'? You see all there is. You can search if you want. This pepper is not hot enough! Exhale for me! No, to my face. You smell of homemade booze. Where is it? Open this up! Damn! How did these cats get in here'? Slaughtering the cats and selling them as rabbits, ha'? Now I know why there's so few cats here. Come on, to the station! Believe me, I didn't do anything. Nergiis! You bitch! I'm gonna die before I have a child! Hey, shame on you! Couldn't hold her even once! Who would ever let you anyways? Shut up, bastard! - Next time it's gonna be my coffee! - I'm sorry, sir. Where were we? He put on a perfect act. Even I could believe that he's an American. Even Yusuf fell for it! I talked to him in Turkish, and he answered back in French. A politician has to be a good actor and pursuade the people. Doesn't make a difference even if you tell the truth to them. The principal is having trouble with the teachers! What's the matter, principal? A new teacher was sent this year. They told me, watch out,.. ...he's a communist. I took pity on him. Bastard...And then? He says American milk is bad for mental health. I swear I'll exile him to hell I Our people are ungrateful by nature. Don't worry.We'll exile him wherever you wish. That would be nice. Now, I call this a point. We do all the work and you get the prize. Bekir Bey! They are calling you from the construction site. - All right. See you soon. - Come again. What are you doing, master Yusuf? Halting work at such a critical time'? Is this what we deserve'? I'm very disappointed. You have provoked the workers, instead of calming them down. I haven't provoked anyone! A worker's labor has to be paid for justly. Did you learn that from the communists? Those were the words of St. Ali! He was not an economist. There's a financial crisis. We can't receive our allowance. You should help the party out. We helped as much as we can. Is this your final decision, master'? All right, Yusuf Usta. I did all I could. Take them away! Semra! Where are you'? Mom! The mayor is here. - Here mayor, sit down. - Thanks, dear. Welcome mayor. What's going on'? The workers have caused some problems. Speak openly, mayop It's because of the workers... They've taken Yusuf to the station. - Does Munir Agha know about this'? - Yes. Don't worry. Gendarmes may search the house, so hide whatevefls dangerous. Like what? Illegal tobacco, homemade booze... And Yusuf Usta used to have books. There's a few, like the Thousand and One Nights. Whatever... Just burn them. - What's up, muhtar? - It's nothing. - So who's a traitor? - Didnt I say it's nothing? Good bye. See what came upon us? Don't you worry. I'll get him tomorrow. - What am I gonna do now'? - Just mind your business. - Cemal, come with me! - Coming! - Nazli! Why's Mom crying? - They put Dad in jail. Come here. Don't play with boys again, OK? Nazli! Throw these in the fire. I'll go fetch some water. - Mom, can I come too? - No, I'll be right back. Hey! Those are school books! Shut up! These are books, too! I don't wanna drink donkey milk and get beaten up at school anymore. They don't hand out a single penny... ...and then throw them to jail when they ask for it! I bet they are beating him as we speak. They stood against the State. Who would ever do that? What's his crime, other than working non-stop for years'? Ahh, my daughter! Dreams are told to flowing water and it's Joseph the prophet... ...who will give meaning to them, my girl. Tell your dream to the waterfall. I dreamed of god, mommy. He was pure white and naked. We flew over cotton clouds and came to heaven. There were doves flying all over... I realized I also had wings, just like the doves. I was very haPPY- - How are you, beautiful one'? - I'm fine. Poor thing! So this evil had to find you, my girl'? - Sehra, guess what is it 7 - White shoes. How did you know? - Do you like them? - Yes. Keep them until I get well. In my dream, I saw the waterfall. Go and see if the water flows as it used to. Okay, I will. - Mom. - Yes, dear. I'm thirsty. Here, drink it. - Mommy, where are you'? - Right here, baby. - Mommy, is Cemal gone'? - He's right here. - Mommy. - Mommy would die for you, baby. Mommy, I'm sleepy. Sleep baby, sleep, my angel, my beautiful daughter. Who knows what dream you're seeing now. He loves me, he loves me not. Stop here, hey! - What's going on'? - Something you wouldn't understand. Come on. You think I'm a donkey? There might be a war,.. With the Greeks... Dear citizens. As of the previous midnight, The land, naval... and air forces of the Turkish Military has taken control of the country. Didn't I tell you it won't last for long like this'? The grasshopper jumps once, twice, and in the third gets caught! Dear citizens. As of the previous midnight, The land, naval... ...and air forces of the Turkish Military has taken control of the country.
