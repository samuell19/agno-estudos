Wearing kurta-pajama, a cheap hat and flocking the streets on Friday to offer prayers doesn't make one a Muslim. The parents make their children memorise the verses of the Quran in Arabic, but they don't know the meaning. If they did, Muslims wouldn't be in this deplorable state. We would have fought for our place. And we will. We'll fight and get our rightful place, God willing. God willing. 'It's the ultimate truth.' 'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

You roam around all night on your motorbike these days. Stop doing that and sit at the shop, or else get out of my house. I don't want to sell 'paan'. Do you want to be a goldsmith then? I'm trying to make ends meet, and you want a life of luxury. Greetings, Mr Chaubey. - Greetings... What are you doing, Sonkar? We must keep India clean. Move it! - I'll tell mom you hit me. Hey, don't tell mom. Hey, Sonkar! Mr Chaubey's son looks more like you, rather than his father. Lallan, even you look like me. Are you opening up late today? Lallan, the advocate is here too. Hey, Chutkan. I'm here. - Hello! Greetings, Kanhaiya. Greetings, sir. - May you be at peace. I got you the medication for constipation. - Okay. This is what you have to do. You must take four tablets four times a day. Got it? - Four times. Very well. - Here's your tea, sir. Yes. Would you like to place a bet for Rs 100? On what? Australia will beat India tomorrow. India cannot lose. Counsellor! - Welcome, Mr Chaubey. Don't place any bets with Lallan. He never loses a bet. Greetings! - Who's that? Oh! You got such a lot of bread early in the morning, Farhad. The feat is in the evening. - Actually... Spit the 'paan' out first. He says that aunt needed it early. - Have a 'paan'. I will bring fresh bread later in the evening for the feast. Aayat. Aayat! Rashid, please keep the bread in the kitchen. Okay. Rashid. - Yes? Place a newspaper under that. May I say something to you? - Yes. You don't seem like yourself when you dance. Is it? So, do you like her or me? Well, I like your neighbour Tarannum too. Let me tell you something. - Aayat! Uncle... Uncle is here... Wear the pink dress that I gave you on your birthday. You look lovely in it. - Aayat! Rashid. - Greetings, aunt. Tell your mom to bring the drum along in the evening. - Yes. Aayat, where is your mom? Does she need an invitation to come downstairs? You're here. - Yes. Do you know what time it is? - Why? I came home directly after offering prayers. Didn't you go to Kanhaiya's tea stall to have tea? Oh! - Greetings. Here, my child. - Hurry up, Salim. Some friends get together over a cup of tea and chat a while. But you can't take it. If I couldn't take it, I'd have made your life miserable by now. Don't say that, Tabassum. I will marry you again. You are turning 65 tomorrow. And you want to marry. - So what? Choti Tabassum! - Coming. You don't do anything except feed the birds. We have to make arrangements for the banquet this evening. We don't have enough money to buy meat. Don't worry about the money. What do you mean? When we don't have money, why should we worry about it? I'm coming, Tabassum. I was making a list. Where is Shahid? The lights have to be put up as well. He was repairing Sonkar's TV the entire night. Oh! - I don't know where he is. Okay. How many guests are there? - 72. Greetings. I heard 72. There weren't as many people at our wedding. Greetings, Tabassum. Greetings. - Oh! Why are the onions cut in chunks? Have you done this? How much meat do we need for the banquet? Tell him that 30 kg will be enough. I haven't counted children. I hope we don't fall short. There's never enough when he cooks. I think we should get 40 kg should be more than enough. 30 kg! We don't want to waste the food. 30 kg should be enough. - Okay. I'll get 30 kg. 30 kg should be fine. Keep this. No... - Take this. You can return it later. Greetings! - Greetings to you too. Aftab had called me last night. He asked me to go to the airport. Aarti is coming from London to surprise us. - Aarti! Aarti! - Look who is here. Greetings. How are you? - God bless you. Hey... - God bless you. Where is Aftab? - He is in Germany. I planned this trip alone. You could have called us. - You gave us a surprise. Did you like the surprise? - When I saw you, I wanted to scold you for coming without informing us. But now that you are here, I'm so happy. Come and give me a hug. - Wow! You are turning 65. How could out get angry? I have brought a gift for you. Oh! - What about me? I have brought perfume for you. Wear it in the evening. Greetings. - Greetings to you too. You seem to have lost weight. Even I have lost weight. Of course. That's because you have lost a lot of hair. Look at that. I think she has lost weight. - Go and make some tea. I'll also have some tea. What? Who will bring the meat? What will we serve the guests? - Oh, yes. Go on. - 40 kg, right? 30! Yes. 30. - He seems to have turned deaf. 30! Uncle Bilaal! Yes, come on. Uncle Bilaal. Take us to the street corner. We are going to school. - Hop on. Why are you going to the school when you don't want to study? Count the cash, uncle. It will be demonetised soon. I bet you find some way to use the cash, Bilaal. I'll lose my weight if you make me run around. What is this I hear? - What did you hear? Aftab called me. I'm here to tell all of you about it. Aftab and I are planning to live separately for a couple of months. I'll never be able to repay this family for everything they gave me. None of my wishes were fulfilled by my parents. But you fulfilled all my wishes. But there's one thing left. When I got married, my mom said, 'It's your responsibility to keep the brothers together.' But I couldn't do it. Why? We live together, don't we? You don't talk to each other. What's the point of living together? Forget it. Keep this money. You might need it in the evening. Take it. Come on. Bilaal is an irresponsible man. Well, it's not that I don't like kids. Mother keeps telling me. Children... Then what's the problem? He wants to decide their religion before they are born. Children follow the religion which their parents follow. Which religion do their parents follow? I remember, when I got married neither Aftab nor any of you asked me about my religion. I married a human being, not any religion. But why does he want to place the condition to decide the religion of the children even before they are born? Mom, let Aarti get some rest. So, Aarti, tell me. Where should I fix these lights? Mom wanted to fix them on the trees as well. Come on, let's fix the lights. We'll fix it everywhere. - Yes. Come on, let's decorate the entire house. Sonkar, stop smelling the food, it's not in good taste. You will spoil the korma. Ali, the aroma is fantastic. That's obvious. - Tell me one thing. Did Shrivastav's son marry a Christian? You always have your eyes on other people's wives. Mr Chaubey is eating kebabs. Oh! Hear this. Chaubey is secretly eating kebabs. He eats it every day without his wife's knowledge. Someone call Aarti. Hey, Aarti. "My beloved wanted my love for only that could satisfy him." "He gave the cash to the other woman and came to me broke." Will you be going to Kanpur to watch the match? Yes, I'll leave later tonight. Wow! India will win. "There was once a thief." "He had a long beard." "My beloved was brutal," "like a wild horse." "He held me by my wrist." "And closed his eyes." "For my beloved seemed squint-eyed." "Yes, he was squint-eyed." "I said, I don't care." "I said, I don't care." "I said, I don't care." "I said, I don't care." "I said, I don't care." Hey, Salim. Come here. The korma is ready. Feed it to the children first. I'll go get dressed. - Okay. Hey, Vimla. You aren't eating. - No. You can't refuse. We have made vegetarian food especially for you. Choti... Here it is. Have it. We do attend their functions, but we don't eat at their house. "My beloved wanted to hold my hand." "To spend some time together." "I felt a bit shy." "When he asked me for something in the night." "He looked innocent," "but he was quite cunning." "If he was like an emperor," "I was nothing less than a queen." "When he teased me," "I took him to task." "But he couldn't take his eyes off me." "He just couldn't." "I said, you stand no chance." "I said, you stand no chance." Hey, keep some for Murad in a separate bowl. Or else there will be none left for him. I've already kept some aside. One for him, and another for us. Okay. Wait a minute... How will you lose weight if you don't stop doing this, uncle? Aunt! - I will... Everything is possible by the will of God. Yes! - Dad. Greetings. - Come here. "When I asked my wife for some love," "she demanded the whole market in return." "From gold jewellery to pearl necklaces," "From diamond earrings to silver anklets..." "Dupattas clad with stars," "and everything was on discount." "My wife's choices were lavish...' "Quite Lavish... - Oh, my God!" "I said, forget it!" "I said, forget it!" "I said, forget it!" "I said, forget it!" "I said, forget it!" "I said, forget it!" Salim, keep another cauldron of korma over there. Everybody will pounce on the food now. - Yes, ma'am. Come on. They have started making rotis. Very good. Aftab sounded sad over the phone. Well, I'm not sad. But the children... Can we talk about this later? We'll talk after you return from the match. I won't talk to mother before you're back. I promise. Let's teach Chaubey a lesson. Give me a bowl of korma. Uncle... - Father, don't... Keep quiet. Why are you doing this? - Mr Chaubey... Have some piping hot korma! No, we're vegetarians. We're vegetarians. Oh, really! Well, then enjoy the bitter gourd and okra. Yes... - Don't forget to eat it. Wahid! Start making some dessert to go along with the korma. Why are you getting down here? Dad, I have to meet my friends here, and then we'll leave for Kanpur. Okay. Well then... Take care. - Yes. Goodbye. When we went to meet the prospective bride for Bilaal, Farhad was very excited. Bilaal had chosen the bride for him, and he wanted revenge. How was the korma? - It was wonderful. We reached her house and saw her. My joy knew no bounds. She was extremely beautiful. I asked her, 'What's your name?' We speak to the girl to make sure that she doesn't stammer. So, I asked her, 'What's your name?' And she said... She said... She said... What did she say? Hold on. I can't stop laughing. She replied, 'I'm Tabassum.' We had two women named Tabassum in our family. I was really overwhelmed. And then, I said, 'You are Junior Tabassum and I'm Senior Tabassum.' Is that okay? And then we met her... When I met her, I felt, she's the one who can love Aftab more than me. I never asked her anything. Come and give me a hug! Wonderful. God bless you! Serve the coffee now. If you brew it so much, the coffee beans might spout. Serve it. 'Incredible shot.' 'Beautiful timing.' You seem to signal him a lot, nowadays. Aayat! - Yes, uncle. Here, take this... Aarti, I needed some help. - Yes, tell me. Will you please smell the milk? Go ahead. This is fresh milk. Unlike the milk you get in plastic bags and containers. And you say, 'Visit London. Life is good over there.' We'll order milk from India. I'll paint the shop by Eid, and put up a new board. You can tell your customers, that your stall is opposite Shahid Electronics. Bilaal, why don't you get me a new 4G connection? You keep telling me to get you a 4G connection. It's going to be 6G soon. 'We have some breaking news.' 'A blast happened in Allahabad.' - Bilaal, watch this. 'The bomb exploded inside a bus.' 'The bus was travelling from Varanasi to Allahabad.' '40 passengers were on board the bus.' 'The bus had departed from Varanasi.' 'RDX has been used, at least 10 people are presumed dead.' 'Please... - What about the further investigation?' 'Please... Stay back.' Mom! Mom, Shahid's on TV! - Yes... Mom, Shahid's on TV! - Where is he? He's right there, on top... On the right side of the screen. He's in the second row. - Exactly. Didn't he just wave at us? - Yes. I can't see him. - I can't see properly without my glasses. We expected that from Aayat, but you too, Aarti! Naughty girl! There's no one here! Here, have a bite, mom. - Don't be naughty. Hey, come here! He hit a six! What's the score? - 44 runs. You're going to lose today. How about you? - Never against you. Why not? 'And he went through...' What's that flag on your motorcycle? It's the party's flag. Don't get involved in politics. Stay put at the shop and help me out. And earn a living. Everybody can earn money, dad. But very few get the opportunity to work for their religion and their nation. Go and check out the news. They're killing us in our own country. And you feast at their house. Get the CCTV footage of all the private cars on this road in the last one hour, and get their details. And find out how many buses left for Allahabad from Phulpur during the time of the blast. Please, be quick! 'Sir, have you identified the terrorists, yet?' 'We're checking the CCTV footage.' 'We'll keep you updated.' 'Sir, is it some terrorist organisation...' Bilaal. - Yes. We'd brought 350 SIM cards last month. 74 of which are in stock. Which means 276 SIM cards have been sold. The money... - What? Have we received the payment? I'm not talking about the payment, Bilaal. I have receipts of 262 SIM cards, and 14 of them are missing. How did that happen, Bilaal? I never issued a SIM card without making a receipt. Come on... Why don't you figure out something? I know you can manage. Do something about it. Station our men at the hospital. Look for those who have regained their senses or are about to. Ask them if they saw any suspicious person. Crosscheck that data with the CCTV footage. Sir, we've identified three suspects from the CCTV footage. The voice that we'd sent for sampling, we suspect it is Mehfooz Alam's voice. Let's go. 'According to our sources' 'the mastermind behind this blast is' 'the dreaded terrorist, Mehfooz Alam.' 'The police believe that the other terrorists will be identified soon. 'The opposition believes that the blast was planned' 'to provoke communal violence before the upcoming elections.' 'But the police believes' 'that a Jihadist group is responsible for the blast.' Goodness gracious. I wonder how they can term this jihad. Do they even know the meaning of jihad? Jihad means war, right? Jihad means... Jihad means struggle. Struggle against your bad habits. Struggle against injustice... That is jihad. 'They had planted bombs in three different buses.' 'The Allahabad police has issued the photographs of 3 terrorists.' 'They are trying to gather more information about them.' Mom! Uncle! Mom! - What happened? Uncle! - What happened? What happened, Aayat? That's Shahid. A terrorist... They're saying that Shahid is a terrorist. Look at those pictures... What was he wearing? Is it really Shahid? What was he wearing? 'The police investigation is in process.' Was he wearing a white shirt? What is all this, Murad? Get my cell phone. Chaubey... Come here quickly. - Yes. What's the matter? - Come here, quickly! What's the matter? 'The police has issued an alert on the highway.' Isn't that Shahid? - Yes. He's Shahid. But he'd gone to Kanpur to watch the match. I wonder if Murad is aware of this. It's on TV, Sonkar. The whole of Varanasi has seen it. Let's inform the police. Are you nuts? He's from our neighbourhood. It's not about our neighbourhood. It's about the country. Chaubey! - 16 people are dead. My son is right. Driver, listen! Please pull over. I need to get down. Goodbye. Come on. I got off the jeep. Leave for Bhadohi, Shahid. Stay underground for a couple of days. - Yes, Alam. You did a great job. Thank you, Alam. The Lord is watching you. - Correct. Goodbye. 'We have just received news that two boys' 'on board a truck travelling from Allahabad to Phulpur' 'opened fire on the police and fled.' What is all this, counsellor? Mr Yadav... That's why I'm here. They haven't revealed their names, but we suspect... Are you still in doubt? Chaubey! - Who is Chaubey? Do you realise what's happening? What do you people not get over here? Did we tell you to stay back? You should have gone to Pakistan! If you really like using arms and ammunition, send your children to the army. Why do you kill innocent people? - Chaubey! Look at us... We treat you with utmost respect. We greet you with affection. It's disgusting! We've been friends for 40 years. How would you feel if you were in my shoes? Think about it. - Stop it, Chaubey. 'We have some breaking news. The explosion that occurred 'at Hanuman Gunj bus station near Allahabad' 'has left more than ten people dead and more than 20 people injured.' 'The police suspect this to be a terror attack' 'executed by three terrorists.' 'The police has killed two of the terrorists in an encounter.' 'The third terrorist Shahid Mohammed,' 'is said to be a resident of Varanasi is still absconding.' 'According to our sources, he's hiding in a house in Bhadohi.' 'The house has been surrounded' 'by the police and an ATS team.' Is he having breakfast? Tell him SSP Danish Javed had called. Come on, make way. Step back. - Come on, step back. Sir, we have surrounded the house. We've covered the perimeter. Sir, over there... They hide in such rat holes. Each lane has over 100 houses, and each one is filled with kids freaking out. They have always been like that. I'm sorry, sir. Yes, sir. Keep the press at a distance of 100 metres. Is everything under control? Yes, sir. It's totally under control. It's a rented house. We've surrounded it. Come on, step back. - Move it. No, sir. I don't need additional forces. Yes. Sir, if you allow him, I'll go in alone and shoot him dead in five minutes. Try to get him alive. Sir, he will become a famous terrorist. We'll keep making security arrangements, and he'll become a star on TV. Sir, should I kill him? Okay, sir. Try to persuade him to talk to his family. I'll try to speak to him. 16 of our people are dead, and we've to keep negotiating. Hey, come here. Yes, sir. - I want a soldier on every rooftop. Get it? And make sure their guns are working. Don't apologise later. - Yes, sir. Sir, there are kids in the neighbouring house. Didn't you think about it before giving him a place to hide? Evacuate the children. Yes, sir. SSP Mishra. Anti-terrorist. We need to speak to you. Come in. Yadav. His life is in danger. If he surrenders, he might live. Shahid, I envy you. The Almighty has chosen you. 'These are the very people who have persecuted us for years.' Accept the gift of God. Don't spare anyone. May the Almighty grant you success. 'Allah is the greatest.' Start firing, young man. Okay, Alam. I want to hear the sound of gunfire. 'Allah is the greatest.' 'Allah is the greatest.' You dare shoot at me! You're from Varanasi, aren't you? Have you read SSP Danish Javed's name in the newspaper? If I lose my cool, I will riddle your body with bullets. The police have reached your house. They are requesting us to let them talk to you. If you deem fit. Or else your entire family will be killed. You decide what to do. Or else it is just you and me. Shahid... Shahid, who set you up? No one has set up. All Muslims have been set up. Even you have been set up. You won't understand now. What are you saying? Son, come home and talk to us. Meet us, please. - Believe us. Son, it is your father, everything will be alright. Mom, I can't come home. Shahid, please come back. I am waging war. For all of you, for our religion. Shahid, what is wrong with you? Son, please come home. You said you would open a showroom. I will help you open one. Just come back home. - Come back! Everything will be fine. - Shahid. Dad, there will be no showroom. Until we don't defeat these infidels, Muslims won't prosper. Why don't you understand that there were three Muslims among those 16 people? They were not Muslims. They thought they were Muslims. Like you think you're a Muslim. What are you saying? Son, listen, everyone loves you very much. We love you a lot. Your family and friends... I know they say that you are a bad person. Come back home. - Yes, son. She's right, please return home. All of you should be proud of me. You will feel proud when you see me in His abode. I will stand proudly besides Him. Goodbye. Shahid! - Shahid. Son! - Shahid! Shahid. - Shahid! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! I'm posting some guards outside your house. Guards! But why? It's needed. This is my house. I don't need security. You will be surprised. They are taking Uncle Bilaal to the police station. I will go with him. God, have mercy. Why will you go with him? I will go with him. - No, you stay here with the family. I will keep you posted. Oh, God! One moment. Who are you? I am his lawyer. Sir, will you tell us who is the mastermind? Three terrorists have been gunned down. But we're still looking for the mastermind behind the blasts. We will get to him soon. But, sir... - That will be all. I'm out. Sir, can you tell us how long will it take to find him? Send the dead body home after the autopsy. Drag the body all the way. Let them know how the police operates. - Okay, sir. Oh, God! Sir. There are eight pieces. Two CPUs. There's a lot of material too. He's in for a long haul. Thank you, sir. Hurry up. It must have reached. Check the old man's CDR. So many calls made to Pakistan. None of it has any sugar. Look here. Answer me. Had you been there? Did you teach him how to manufacture bombs or did you send him for training? Sir, I had no clue that he was in the company of such people. Bilaal, stop pretending. Bilaal... Don't try to pun on an act. Do you hear me? I could've arrested your son if I wished. I shot him four times. One shot in the head and three in the chest. Only then did he die. The post-mortem is going on. Allow us to go there. We need to hear their conversation. You cannot stop us. This is not done. Allow us to go there. Yes? Give me the keys. I will open it for you. This is my shop. Just give me the keys. It will take us a lot of time. I will open it for you. This is my shop. Consider yourself lucky that this isn't your shop. Give me the keys. Thank you. We'll call you. Move back. Come on! My name is Bilaal. Shahid was a terrorist. I am his father. I don't know anything else. My name is Bilaal. Shahid was a terrorist. I am his father. I don't know anything else. My name is Bilaal. Just a minute, father. Yes. - Aarti... How much more time will Bilaal take? I think it will be long. I will come there. - No. You don't need to. I am sitting in the corridor. You stay with the family. I will keep calling you. Aftab had called. He wanted to come here, but I told him not to. We'll wait for a couple of days. Okay. Sir, please. Just two questions. Father... - No. Father, are you okay? - Please leave. Hello! Father, are you okay? - Sir, please. Hello? - Yes. Yes, I am alright. Shahid was a terrorist. Keep saying it. I am his father. If you remember anything, say that too. My name is Bilaal. Shahid was a terrorist. I am his father. Greetings, sir. We are organising all-night prayers for the Goddess. Park your car over there for a few days. Even you're invited. Hey! Keep working. - Okay. 'And this has resulted in some hope that a lot will change.' The demand for reservation.' I watched TV all night and saw this newspaper in the morning. To be honest, I can't believe it. He had a terrorist at home and he was not aware of it. Muzzamil who lives in the neighbourhood teaches my daughter maths. What do I do now? Should I take homeopathic medicine from him or not? Should I send my daughter to Muzzamil for tuitions? Didn't I tell you to turn the speaker towards Badar Manzil? Go and fix it. Chaubey, what is your son up to? No prayers were organised in this temple till date. If there haven't been prayers, there had never been a terrorist in the neighbourhood either. They should know that the entire country will stand together if needed. Hello! Yes, Murad Ali Mohammed speaking. Yes. I will be waiting. Chhoti, they are coming here with Shahid's dead body. You will have to sign to receive the dead body. Come with me. No... I don't want it. His shouldn't be brought to this house. I don't want him in this house. Never! Shahid is not welcome in this house. Bury him, cremate him, throw away his dead body. Don't bring him to this house! He is not my son. Tabassum, let me go. His dead body shouldn't be brought to this house. Tabassum, let me go. Tell them not to bring his corpse to this house. Come with me. "The most forgiving and merciful..." Murad, don't bring his corpse to this house. "I am shattered completely. Lend me Your support." "There is darkness everywhere. Let there be light." "I am shattered completely. Lend me Your support." "There is darkness everywhere. Let there be light." Please sign here. We don't want him. - What? He is not from our family. Do whatever you want with him. We don't want him. "I'm not myself anymore." "Smothered in a cloud of smoke." "No sight of land or sky." "Where am I?" "Lead me to my destination, Lord Almighty." "Show me the way, Lord Almighty." "Lead me to my destination, Lord Almighty." "Show me the way, Lord Almighty." "Guide us on to the right path." "The path of those who You have graced and not of those who have angered You." No, Aftab. It doesn't look good. They have been questioning him for the past 17 hours. Yes. Sorry. "Take my breath away, let me die." "I've been away from home for long, let me go home." "How long should I think about You and pray to You?" "Come before me, I want to question Thee." "Am I wrong or is it the world?" "Or are You wrong?" "O Lord, answer me." "I stand before Thee." Can I meet him? - We're arresting him. We will conduct a medical test first and produce him in court in two hours. Talk to your lawyer if you wish. I am his lawyer. - Oh, really? Uncle, don't worry. I am with you, don't worry. The FIR has been filed. Have a look. You have no choice but to defend him. By the way, what's your name? Aarti. What's your full name? Aarti Mohammed. Doctor, she's sweating profusely, she has turned cold too. If you could please come immediately... Yes, she's nervous. Tell me which medicine... Aayat, mix some sugar and salt in a glass of water and bring it. Please spell it. Mix sugar and salt in a glass of water and bring it for your mom. Okay, thank you. Where is she going? Aayat! Aayat! No, father. There will be no press. The police will get custody. There's a special court, I will attend. Okay, the card was renewed the last time. Step back. Wait a minute. Go on. 'State versus Bilaal Mohammed!' I want his custody. Your Honour, the accused Bilaal Mohammed is the father of one of the terrorists involved in the Allahabad bomb blasts. The police took him into custody and have made preliminary enquiries. But for a thorough investigation, the court is requested to grant 14 days police custody. What do you have to say, ma'am? My Lord, my client has already been questioned non-stop for 17 hours. His house was searched too, and he will be available for further questioning, there is no need for the police to retain custody. I see. Does the police not need it? Your Honour, the evidence can be tampered with. There can be a threat to his life too. The investigation will be hampered. Mr Santosh Anand, you seem quite concerned about the life of the accused. Police custody granted. Thank you. Sir, my client has gone through immense mental trauma. I fear his life is at risk too. Hence, I request that his medical report be provided to me every 48 hours, and as per the provisions under section 41 D CRPC, grant us permission to meet him during the investigation. - Alright. Are you new to this court? I haven't seen you before. Alright, granted. 'State versus Bundaram.' Where is Rashid? - What happened? Wait! Listen! Listen to me! Listen! Rashid! Rashid, come downstairs! Rashid! You knew, didn't you? - What? You were aware, weren't you? I didn't know about yesterday's plan. Then what were you aware of? Rashid, my brother Shahid died. What happened? Tell uncle what you did. Shahid was unable to find his cell phone that day. When I found it near the television, I went to his room to surprise him. 'Shahid, I found the phone.' 'Aayat. - What's that?' 'We were just having fun.' When I asked them, they told me they were just watching it. When I questioned Rashid today, he got scared. He didn't tell me anything. I will go and ask Rashid. Where is Rashid? I am... Greetings. Greetings. I want to talk to Rashid. I sent him to Dubai. I mean, he is leaving tonight. Bilaal is in deep trouble and I somehow want to prove that Bilaal has got nothing to do with what Shahid did. So... - No. Bilaal is your friend too. So, what do I do? What do you expect me to do? Should I take the blame on me? Should I get my son into trouble? In fact, you should not get us involved. You have been disgraced. We shouldn't... The mistakes committed by Shahid, that you might have overlooked. Murad, you've been pointing out my mistakes all my life. I failed to understand my mistakes. When you didn't realise that Shahid was making mistakes, how could I? I was assured as Shahid was under your care. It was better for him not to learn anything from me. If you have made any mistakes... You're talking to me after two long years. I've always been wanting to please you somehow so that you start talking to me again. I might have erred. But it wasn't intentional. It wasn't intentional. Please get me released, Murad. Get me out of here. Please get me released. Everything will be alright, uncle. I hope you're not being tortured. - No. If they do, let us know. Okay. Bilaal! I will have you discharged honourably. Good day, Murad. - Good day. 'There never used to be so much traffic here.' 'There's a shrine ahead.' 'They must be celebrating.' 'Why are they doing that on the street?' 'Uncle, they go to the shrine to celebrate.' 'When the shrine was built, there was space in the city,' 'it wasn't densely populated.' 'But it's different now.' 'Customs should change with time.' 'Customs never change, uncle.' 'No community has stopped celebrating on the streets.' I seem to have missed something. What is justice, counsellor? There was no judicial system in the prehistoric times. Man would drink cow's milk. And a tiger would eat the cow. Nobody believed in the law. Neither man nor cow. It was only after society was formed, that there was talk of laws. And it was decided that those who obey the law will be happy and those who don't will be unhappy. But is it possible all the time? - No. At times, the one who obeys the law will be unhappy. Isn't that true? That's great. Isn't it, Danish? Is truth more important or the law? I take your leave. We can continue this conversation some other time. Good day. He talks a lot. He is Dr Shastrabudhe. He is quite useful. Well-connected politically. Has the media in his control. Nowadays, it's not just the arguments in court that make an impact. What is debated on TV, what's published in the newspapers and on social media. All of that has a great impact on the case. I have summoned him for our case. He will manage everything. Greetings. - Greetings. Two of the three terrorists involved in the Allahabad blasts on 14th October were shot dead by the police at a distance of around 100 kilometres from the scene of their crime, and their leader, Shahid Mohammed was cornered at one of his hideouts. At his other hideout in Madanpura, Varanasi... Objection! Allow him to complete, Mr Ali. Your Honour, it's not a hideout, it's a house. You may call it a house. Allow me to call it a hideout. There's an ancestral house in Madanpura and the house belongs to a family. The activities happening there don't usually happen in a house, Mr Ali. That's what he meant. Don't call it a hideout, Mr Anand. Call it a house. Alright. If you see the telephone records of Bilaal Mohammed, you will come to know that in the past three months he has received 300 calls from five numbers in Pakistan. Pakistan. 300 calls from Pakistan, Mr Ali Mohammed. Therefore, the accused Bilaal Mohammed should be charged under sections 302, 120B and 124A of Indian Penal Code 1860, section 9B of Explosive Act 1884, and section 16 of unlawful activities prevention act 1967. That's all, Your Honour. Is Afzal at home? Tabassum Zohra. Wasn't that was your name before marriage? Yes. How long have you known Mehfooz Alam? What? Since when do you know Mehfooz Alam? I don't know him. - You don't? Does your mom not know Mehfooz Alam? Alright. You must have heard your mom mention Mehfooz. Did you hear the name or not? Look at me and talk. No, I haven't. - I will put both of you behind bars. When did you introduce Mehfooz Alam to Shahid? When and how? They never met. Look, your son is dead. I'll make sure your husband is not released for 10 to 20 years. Tell me everything you know about Mehfooz, so that you and your daughter can go home. When and how did Shahid meet Mehfooz? Look, we'll be able to help you only if you help us, or else... Who will marry her? Think about the future. Think and let me know. Greetings, counsellor. Greetings. Things were different earlier. There was no television or internet. Nobody knew what was going on in the world. But now, kids get to know everything. What do they get to know? They get to know the condition of the Muslims in this world. The kids get to see everything. They get to hear everything. By the grace of God, they are eager to fight for the Muslims. We should thank you and Shahid for doing what I was supposed to do. May God grant heaven to Shahid. We've heard a proverb since childhood, 'The British left, but they left their progeny behind.' The proverb has changed now. 'The Moghuls left, but they left Jihad behind.' Objection, My Lord! Mr Anand, refrain from making religious comments in court. I won't allow it. It is not religious, My Lord. Terrorism has nothing to do with religion. 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.' He said something like that, doesn't he? Your Honour, this is not a case where a terrorist killed innocent people and the court convicted him. Then, there's the next case. Candle marches are held. How long will this continue? My Lord, I will take some more time of the court. But this is an ideal case to understand terrorism. Santosh Anand, you always take more time. Go ahead, I'm listening. The situation that we're dealing with is the business of terrorism. There are lots of children in their community. Objection, My Lord! Which community is he talking about? He's talking about your community. Mr Anand, you can't level allegations against religion in court. This is my second warning. My Lord, it's not an allegation, there's enough data. More than one marriage is allowed in their community. It is obvious that they'll have more children. More than one marriage is allowed to give birth to more children. They are crying. In their community, the level of education is very low. Objection, My Lord! Why are you taking it personally? Let me finish. My Lord, I will produce some data pertaining to that. When there are more children and very few jobs, one of the family members is sent on the path of Jihad. Giving them a chance to serve their religion and also earn some money. My Lord, Bilaal Mohammed is a member of such a family. To prove my point, I would like to present Bilaal Mohammed before the court. Bilaal Mohammed, present yourself in court. What's your name? Bilaal. - What does it mean? Your Honour, Bilaal is the name of their ancestor mentioned in the Quran who was the first to give the Azaan in the history of Islam. Azaan is a call to prayer which is given five times a day through huge loudspeakers in every city of our country. Objection, My Lord! Five times a day we are told that there is only one God and they are the ones who worship Him, that is Allah! Objection, My Lord! He's merely stating a fact, Mr Ali Mohammed. Isn't the call to prayer given five times a day, through loudspeakers? Our Hindu Gods have no value. They aren't considered to be Gods. 'There's no God but Allah...' Don't they say that in Arabic? Well, I know a bit of Arabic... - Objection, My Lord! The public prosecutor will need to learn a lot more Arabic to find out what the Quran says about other religions. And he also needs to learn some manners. This is not relevant to the case. This is the case, My Lord. This is not just about Shahid and Bilaal. This is a case about a mentality that kills innocent people in the name of religion and then they say, 'Every Muslim is not like that.' Well, then, who will tell us who is and who isn't like that? Objection, My Lord! He's connecting crime to religion. Mr Ali Mohammed, he is arguing that this crime is connected to religion. Please sit down. Yes. You teach the Quran to children since childhood, right? - Yes. You must have taught it to Shahid too. We did try, but he showed little interest. If this is what he did when he had little interest, what if he had developed a keen interest? I object, Your Honour! This is blasphemous! Why don't you listen to him? You will get your chance. I am sorry, Your Honour. I am not insulting any religion. I respect Mr Ali Mohammed, he's like my elder brother. Your Honour, Hindu and Muslims live together in this country. Every Muslim is welcomed in this country and the society respects them because his Muslim community has given us gems like Abdul Hameed, Abdul Kalam, Bismillah Khan, though it is exceptional. Your Honour, I would like to call Bilaal Mohammed's daughter Aayat Mohammed to the witness box. Aayat Mohammed, present yourself in court. Go, my child. Aayat, when you came to know that your brother has been killed, how did you feel? Listen, dear, I know it is difficult to answer such a question. But it is important. So, when you learnt that your brother was killed, how did you feel? I felt bad. I felt bad. Why did you feel bad? I used to love him a lot. Exactly! Your Honour, the sister felt bad that her brother got killed, but she didn't feel bad that her brother had killed many innocent people. If he was alive, everything would've been alright. Objection, My Lord! None of the allegations levelled against the accused Bilaal has been proved. And his family members are being questioned on the basis of religion. I am not raising these questions. These questions come to mind naturally. Your Honour, the accused Bilaal and this family prepared the child for martyrdom since childhood. They introduced him to terrorists and incited him against India and Indians. They prepared him and provided him logistical support to carry out the blasts. Your Honour, I'd like to request the court to give me some time to prove that not just the accused, but his entire family is involved in this terrorist conspiracy. Aayat, have one roti at least. Keep it. Mom! Mom! - What happened? Mom... - What happened? What happened? See this. What is it? What happened? Get them out here! Step out of the house! Go inside! Who is it? Murad! - All of you, go inside. Go inside. - Come with me. Go inside. For God sake, come inside. I am feeling scared. I am feeling scared. "I can't take my eyes off you." "Your beauty holds me spellbound." "You are the epitome of love." "I am the eternal spring." "You are the epitome of love." "I am the eternal spring." "We belong to each other" "that's all I know." "If I ever look at someone other than you," "may I go blind." "Even the pebbles on your street seem incredible." "I yearn for..." 'Go to Pakistan' It's good that no one was hurt. Get the wall painted quickly. It doesn't look good. I suggest you should not register an FIR. It must be some hooligans. I'll find them and warn them. It's about the neighbourhood. If an FIR is registered, we will have to investigate the matter. Why do you want to upset them? You will need the help of the people in your neighbourhood in this case. Won't they need me? You don't understand. The case against you is for terrorism. My case is related to terrorism. And what happened last night was done by some hooligans? Well, they didn't kill anyone. What if they had killed someone? Five of us were sitting in the courtyard. They threw 12-15 stones at us. If one or two of us had lost their lives, would you believe that they were terrorists? A lot of people died in Delhi in 1984. They weren't killed by Muslims. Wasn't that an act of terrorism? Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bengal, Gujarat, Ayodhya, Kashmir... Who will decide which of these were acts of terrorism? Who will decide that? And you speak of terrorism! An act of terrorism doesn't necessitate killing someone. Trying to scare someone is also an act of terrorism. Your Honour, I would like to call the accused Bilaal Mohammed's elder brother advocate Ali Mohammed to the witness box. That's unusual. I have the right to call him, Your Honour. Mr Ali Mohammed, can you please tell the court where were you on the night of 6th December 1992? Your Honour, on the night of 6th December 1992, he was at the house of Mir Qasim Asad, which is at a distance of 2 km from his house. 'After the demolition of the mosque,' 'it's now the turn of our homes' 'and our very existence.' 'Everything could be attacked.' 'We are at war.' 'Only those who are prepared to wage war,' 'should live in this city.' 'We will be victorious, God willing.' "Raise the slogan, Allah is the greatest!" "Raise the slogan, Allah is the greatest!" "Raise the slogan, Allah is the greatest!" And most of the rioters were those who were present at that meeting. Murad is not at fault. I took him to the meeting. Silence! Your Honour, this is the copy of the FIR which was registered that night. This family has a history of communalism, sir. Murad has nothing to do with this case. Shahid is my son. I'm responsible for everything, Your Honour. Defence, talk to him. Shahid is my son. He was my son. Murad can't be held responsible. I'm solely responsible for everything. Murad is not at fault. Punish me any way you deem fit. Defence, you need to explain the charges that have been filed against him and that he will face more charges. Take him away. Shahid was a terrorist. I'm his dad. I don't know anything more about him. My name is Bilaal. Shahid was a terrorist. I don't know anything else. He has received calls from the same Pakistani phone numbers that are under investigation. And the investigation has led us to conclude that all the charges levied against Bilaal Mohammed are applicable to Ali Mohammed too. Hence, the investigating officer has named him as an accused in this case. Hence, for further investigation and examination, I plead that Ali Mohammed be remanded to police custody for 14 days. My Lord, this FIR has got nothing to do with this case. Mr Ali Mohammed is a reputed lawyer and citizen of this city. He has been living in that house all his life. He will always be available for examination. The prosecution has no basis for his custody, sir. He is available for examination, right? Press the charges first. We'll talk about the custody later. Fair enough, Your Honour. Thank you. Father. - Yes. Are you okay? Yes... It's just that I am unable to sleep. I was just thinking... When Tabassum came to this house after we got married, she would fight with me quite often. She would complain that I don't love her. I would say that I did. A lot. And she would say, 'Prove it.' How do you prove your love for someone? By showering your love, right? Today, I was asked in court to prove my love for my country. How do I go about it? How do I prove my love? Aarti... I want you to fight this case for me. I want you to prove my love for my country. Or else I'll lose the argument in court. I stand to lose. We won't lose the argument, father. 'After filing charges against the father of Shahid,' 'the terrorist responsible for the blasts in Allahabad,' 'the prosecution has also named Bilaal's elder brother' 'Ali Mohammed as an accused in this case.' Look, Aarti, you got married into that family, we didn't object. But now... Now what, mom? Even the court has said that they participated in the riots. The court didn't say that, mom. The prosecutor said that. Turn on the TV. Everyone is against them. Listen to me. Come back to us. You can go back after the case concludes. We don't want any trouble. It's about terrorism, Aarti. Besides, you are a woman and... And you are unable to say that I'm not a Muslim. I'm the daughter-in-law of this family, mom. And father has given me the responsibility of handling this without considering my gender or my religion. Aarti, please try to understand. It's time for the hearing, mom. I have to go. Just a minute. Yes, Mr Yadav. Tell us. Sir, during the course of the investigation, I searched the accused Bilaal Mohammed's house. A lot of material related to the training of terrorists was recovered from the computer at his house. And an electronic workshop was set up in one of the bedrooms in the house from which a small mobile network has been operated. What do you mean by a small mobile network? You can call it a private mobile network. It doesn't touch any Indian mobile network. And we cannot tap the network. Your Honour, this is the antenna that was used to operate the private mobile network, and it was installed on the rooftop of the hideout. Objection, My Lord, that is a house. Accept the facts now at least, counsellor. Mr Anand, if you have the facts, just present them. Why do you insist on saying something that they don't like? I'm sorry. Your witness, Mohammed Aarti. Sorry. Aarti Mohammed. Mr Yadav, if I may ask, what are your qualifications? Sir, I have a Masters in Computer Applications, besides which I have... - So, if an expert like you had not been present during the investigation, these things wouldn't have been discovered, right? Yes. If you don't have knowledge about computers... I would like to once again show the court Bilaal's phone which the public prosecutor has placed as an exhibit. This is not even a smartphone. In fact, Bilaal Mohammed is a high school pass out. And it's almost impossible for him to know what Shahid was doing on his computer. That's all, My Lord. Well... This proves beyond any doubt, Your Honour that the level of education in their community is very low. This antenna was installed at the hideout... I'm sorry. On the roof of the house. They used to hang out clothes to dry over there. Did none of the family members see this? Or did all of them think that this a new machine to attract pigeons? Your Honour! I would like to call Bilaal Mohammed's helper Afzal Sabir to the witness box. You may go. Go ahead. Yes, Afzal. How long have you been working for Bilaal? It's been a year and a half. - Okay. This month 14 SIM cards were released from your shop without verification of the documents. Is that true? Yes. - On whose instructions? Please tell the court. The 14 SIM cards were delivered without any documents, and Bilaal had asked me to arrange for the documents from somewhere. - Right. Your Honour, the 14 SIM cards were given to Mehfooz Alam. Out of which 4 SIM cards were used during the Allahabad blasts. Point to be noted. That's all. Cross. Afzal, where did you work before you started working for Bilaal? I used to work at Mr Patel's mobile shop in Lahartara. And before that? At Mishra Electronics. While you were working there, did it ever happen that SIM cards were handed over to someone without proper documents? Friends or relatives were given cards sometimes I'm sorry to interrupt, Your Honour, but Mr Patel and Mr Mishra don't promote jihad! Mr Anand, that's a different argument. It doesn't have to do anything with this case. Afzal, did Bilaal Mohammed tell you to give SIM cards to someone without any documents? No, sir. Did Shahid tell you to do that? No. Which means Bilaal could have taken those SIM cards or Shahid might have taken them, or you could have taken them. Objection, Your Honour. The defence is trying to browbeat the witness. Not at all, My Lord. It is a possibility which the public prosecutor might have missed. I'm just presenting it in court. Hence, it can't be conclusively proved that the 14 SIM cards were given to someone with Bilaal Mohammed's knowledge or following his instructions. That's all, My Lord. Greetings, sir. Greetings to you too. - We are holding a meeting for Bilaal. What meeting? For the martyrdom of Shahid... Martyrdom! Was he martyred? Sir, they are defaming our community. Check out the social media platforms and Facebook. If we don't stand united now, it will be impossible for us to live in this country. Which country do you live in? I have the support of my country. The law is doing its job, and I'm doing mine. Of course. I have seen the wall of your house. They have called you a Pakistani. They are bound to write that on my wall. That's because some families celebrate when Pakistan wins. Also, what Shahid did is termed martyrdom. And what some thugs did to my house is called patriotism! Yes. I accept that there are some thugs in our neighbourhood. Just the way we had someone like Shahid. The only difference is that you are looking for the thugs, and I'm looking for Shahid. Do you know this man? No, sir. I don't know him, sir. You and Shahid have met him. You took Mehfooz Alam to the railway station. Your Honour, Hari Om Jewellers is a shop right opposite his shop. I want to show you the CCTV footage of that shop. Exactly ten days before the Allahabad blasts, this terrorist named Mehfooz Alam had visited his shop, Your Honour. What was the amount at which the deal was finalised? He came to the shop with Shahid. I... I didn't even know him. That wasn't your shop. It was your third hideout where you provided SIM cards to the terrorists and finalised a deal. What was the price you got for your son? Objection, My Lord! None of the charges has been proved yet. Mr Anand, do you have any evidence that the deal happened? Well then, I will prove that too, Your Honour. I would like to call the manager of Ameer Nishan Hotel, Abdul Latif to the witness box. 'Abdul Latif, present yourself in court!' Please tell the court your occupation. I own Ameer Nishan Hotel in Dalmandi. Do you know Bilaal Mohammed? I don't know him personally, but a few days ago someone from Pakistan... From where? A guest had arrived from Pakistan. - Okay. He left $1500 cash for Mr Bilaal Mohammed. Did you give the $ 1500 to Bilaal Mohammed? Yes, sir. - When? On 14th October at... - At what time? Around 12 o'clock. Around 12 o'clock on 14th October, that is exactly four hours after the blasts, Bilaal Mohammed gets the money that came from Pakistan. And ten days before the blasts, this terrorist named Mehfooz Alam finalises a deal with Shahid and Bilaal at their third hideout. And for a mere 100,000 rupees 16 innocent Indians are killed. That's all, Your Honour. Uncle, who receives money from Pakistan these days? You are a Muslim. If I do it, the Intelligence Department won't spare me. That's not true. People are doing business with Pakistan. And I received the money from my sister. Neither of us can prove that Aunt Roohi had sent the money. The mode of transfer was not legal. Do you understand that? What could I do? The doctor said that surgery was necessary. I could never do anything for Aayat. I cannot always ask Murad, can I? You are like a daughter to me. I can ask you. Listen, Aarti. They won't spare me. But I beg you. - No. Please get Murad out of this mess. Get him out. It's 12:30, ma'am. A glass of water? What do you think? Will you win the case? What do you think? I will bring forth the truth in court. It's up to the court to do justice. "Hail the Goddess." "Answer the prayers" "of the devotees who flock to You." "We sit at your feet..." "Get rid of all our sorrow." "Your face..." "It gives us great pleasure" "to see You in all Your splendour." "Pay heed to everyone's prayers." "Please help me attain my objective." Let us through. "Your name..." "To see You in all Your splendour." "It gives us great pleasure" "to see You in all Your splendour." Are you done fighting the case? All of you are coming with me. No one will stay here. Where do you not want us to stay? No one will stay back in India. - Why? Why should we stay here? We have no one here. We thought they are family. But did they? A few days back, everyone was here in this veranda, having a feast. And Bilaal's corpse was laid at this very place today. Did any of them come here? Why should we stay here? How can you say that? It wasn't Shahid's funeral. Aunt refused to accept his corpse. Isn't that enough? Aftab is right, Ali. There's a young girl in this house. Uncle's case is over, dad. They have no case against you. The trial will go on for years. Let's leave this place. Why should I leave? Where do I go? This is my home. Why will we let the trial go on for years? What will I say to myself? Am I a traitor? Was Bilaal a criminal? Is Aayat a terrorist? How will Sonkar face the people in this neighbourhood? Will he say that he was supporting terrorists? We'll fight the case right here. We'll fight till the end. And we will let everyone see the fight. Aarti, talk to him. He's absolutely right. No one likes to leave his house. What if we lose the case? We'll speak the truth, Aftab. Sir, it so happened that we received a message on our WhatsApp group around two years ago. It was to help the people of Kashmir who were ravaged by floods. Shahid and I gathered around 7,000 rupees from our friends and acquaintances. We gave the money to Alam. 'Thank you. - You are welcome.' 'What's your name?' 'My name is Rashid.' 'And I'm Shahid.' Alam told us that he's from Mumbai. And that he's an engineer. A few months later, he felt that the poor and deprived Muslims of this country needs him. So, he quit everything else and started helping the needy. What next? After that, he called us a few times... He called us directly a couple of times and asked us to collect donations. And we did it. Twice he told us to deliver the money to someone else. And once, he'd come to Varanasi personally. He met us and took the money. When did you meet him last? Around four months ago. 'I'm tired of all this.' 'I don't get support from the people.' 'I don't get support from the government.' 'They trouble me instead.' 'Why do they trouble you?' 'When I try to help the Muslims in Kashmir,' 'they say that I'm a Pakistani.' 'They tap my phone,' 'and call me to the police station.' 'They trouble all those I speak to over the phone.' 'No...' 'Henceforth, I won't call you.' 'Or else they'll start troubling you too.' 'Why don't you use the internet to make calls?' 'Are you crazy? - What?' 'We have no idea who is and what he wants.' 'I hope you know what the situation is these days.' 'Alam is trying to do something good here.' 'He rightly says that the condition of the Muslims is pathetic.' 'Did I get a job?' 'Did you get a job?' 'Did Ashish get a job?' 'What about Rakesh?' 'We didn't even score that well.' 'Let me make this clear.' 'I don't want to receive any calls or messages from that man.' 'And you won't speak to him either.' 'You won't talk to him!' And I decided not to meet him ever again. My Lord, here is Rashid's phone, and it has the WhatsApp group which he just mentioned. That's all, My Lord. Do you have any questions, Mr Anand? Thank you, Your Honour. Rashid, did you inform anybody about your meeting, my boy? No, I didn't tell anyone about the meeting. What? I didn't inform anyone about the meeting. Did you ever ask Shahid if he had met Mehfooz Alam? I had told him not to. We never spoke about it after that day. Your Honour, it's that simple. Rashid felt that it was a mere coincidence that they met a terrorist. So, Rashid told Shahid, 'Do whatever you want, I'm not interested in terrorism.' That's all. He didn't find the need to speak to anyone from his family about it. Your Honour, for this family terrorism is a profession. Some people take it up, others don't. How would we know which terrorists Rashid continues to be in contact with, as he refuses to divulge any information about them. Or will he speak up when several innocent Indians will be slaughtered? That's all, Your Honour. You may leave. Defence. My Lord, I would like to cross-examine Afzal Sabir, and I'd like to show the footage of Bilaal's shop to the court once again. 'Afzal Sabir, present yourself in court.' Can you please stop there? Afzal, what were you doing standing on a chair? Sir, the account files are kept on the top shelf in the cupboard. Bilaal had told me to retrieve a file of a particular year. When did Bilaal tell you to retrieve the file? He had just arrived at the shop and asked me to get the file immediately. He had just arrived. Okay. Had he come in late that day? No. He had a meeting at the bank. But he had forgotten the file, and he came back to get it. So... When he reached the shop, was someone already present there? Shahid and Alam were present at the shop. Did Bilal know that Alam was going to be there that morning? No, sir. He wasn't even aware that Shahid was there too. Had you seen Mehfooz Alam before? No, sir. Shahid introduced me to Alam that day. He told me that Alam is his friend's elder brother. My Lord, Bilal Mohammed had a meeting at ICICI bank, regarding a loan. He'd forgotten to carry a file, and he returned to the shop to retrieve it. And when he reached the shop, Shahid and Mehfooz Alam were already present there. So, that was the first time when Bilal Mohammed met Mehfooz Alam. Yes, Your Honour. And he didn't like riding the scooter all by himself. And he said, 'It doesn't matter if you're a terrorist.' 'Let's go for a drive!' My Lord, there's a railway station right next to the ICICI bank. So, out of courtesy, Bilal Mohammed offered to drop Mehfooz Alam to the railway station. He was unaware that he was aiding a terrorist. Such an abstract story, Your Honour. Of the highest order... The prosecution still believes that a deal had been finalised between Bilal Mohammed, Shahid, and Mehfooz Alam. You may leave. My Lord, I would now like to cross-examine Ajit Yadav, the nodal officer. Go ahead. Mr Ajit Yadav, do you think anyone could tell that this is a machine for shooting pigeons? I think I wasn't clear enough. Do you think anyone could tell that this is a machine for shooting pigeons? I don't think so, ma'am. It isn't meant for that. What's the probability that someone would figure out what it really is? It isn't possible to say anything in the first look. A tech-savvy boy from their family said, 'This is a signal booster for the dish antenna.' And the family agreed to him. That's it, sir. Your Honour, It's not necessary that Bilal Mohammed or Ali Mohammed knew about this antenna. The prosecution believes that they both knew it very well. They knew what Shahid was up to. And also the amount of money that he was going to get for it. Such an abstract imagination, My Lord. Presumption. Each argument by the public prosecutor is based on the abstract imagination. They think they know that the family is full of terrorists, and everyone is a part of the plan. But they haven't provided any strong evidence to prove it. That's all, My Lord. You may leave. My Lord, I'd like to summon the accused Advocate Ali Mohammed to the witness box. 'What's going on?' Mr Ali Mohammed, do you drive a car? Yes. How many traffic tickets do you have? None. Do you file income tax returns? Yes. Do you vote? - Yes. Do you give bribes? - What? Do you bribe government officials to get your work done smoothly? No. I don't. How many terrorists do you have in your family? None. How can you be so sure? Because I know my family very well. Didn't you know Shahid, very well? Shahid... We made a mistake. What about Bilal? Bilal hasn't done anything. It hasn't been proved to the court yet. The charges levied on him haven't been annulled. Anyway... Your son, Aftab Mohammed, what about him? He has a business in London. Can you be dead sure that he isn't a terrorist? No, he isn't a terrorist. Are you saying this with the same belief, which made you think that Shahid was innocent? I don't have any reason to doubt him. You might not have a reason, Mr Ali Mohammed. But the prosecution believes that you and your family breed terrorists and that's your source of income. You all are accused of being traitors. You and your entire family. We... We aren't traitors. How would you prove that? How do we accept that you aren't a traitor? Just because when you had a choice in the year 1947, to go to a Muslim state, you didn't? Or because you pay income tax, cast votes, and don't bribe government officials? You don't have any proof, Mr Ali Mohammed, to state that you aren't a traitor. And we require proof. We require proof because your look doesn't reflect patriotism. For how long do you have this beard? It's been around three years. - Why? Religious custom. Have you ever thought about this? How would a patriot differentiate between the bearded Ali Mohammed, and those bearded terrorists from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir, whose photographs are printed in newspapers every other day? How would we know that they are the bad Muslims, and you're the good one? Mr Ali Mohammed, your nephew stayed with you in that house, and he has killed 16 people in collaboration with terrorists. Your brother Bilal Mohammed, has been accused of being a part of this conspiracy. You've been accused of being a part of this conspiracy. How would you prove that you're a good Muslim? Tell us... How will you prove that you're a good Muslim? When I'd read the Quran, I knew that Allah would ask me this question on the judgement day. Whether I was a good Muslim or not. And He will decide. He will decide. I tried my best to be a good Muslim, but I made some mistakes. Mr Santosh Anand spoke about the meeting in the year 1992, and I have been accused of disturbing communal harmony. 'They'll set our house on fire.' 'Look outside. People are killing everyone.' 'This is my house. I won't leave this house.' 'We will have to leave. Hurry up, Bilal.' 'I won't leave.' 'That was the night of 6th December 1992.' 'We were very scared on that night.' 'Every Muslim was scared.' 'And some people came to my house.' 'Sonkar. Chaubey.' 'The situation is getting worse.' 'But you don't worry. Both of us will stay here.' 'We won't let any harm come on you.' I wish Chaubey and Sonkar went to every Muslim. I'm sorry to take your time, but it's necessary to know those people who are accused of being terrorists. My lord, whatever happened in this life, it is because of this country. Abdul Hamid fought for the country so did Gandhi, and Mother Teresa. In this country, I also benefited from being a Muslim, and at times, I was under suspicion too, but I will be buried in the very same cemetery which is 200 meters away from my home. The public prosecutor said that he respects the Muslims and welcomes them. Who gave him the right to welcome me in my own house? This country belongs to you and me too. If you think I am unfaithful, go and find out why it is so. If you don't know how to differentiate between Shahid and Murad Ali, then find out why it is so. And if you're unable to differentiate between my beard and Osama Bin Laden's beard, I still have the right to follow my religion. If you are good to me, I will lay down my life for you. But if you point finger at me, then remember, I am not answerable to you, I'm answerable to my community and my country. That's all, my lord. You may go. My lord, I now want to examine the investigating officer Danish Javed. Danish Javed, present yourself in court. As per the phone call records of the accused Bilaal Mohammed submitted by the prosecution, about 300 calls are from Pakistan. Can you tell us from which terrorist organisation these calls were made? We don't know yet, but we've sent a request to the Government of Pakistan and our own intelligence. Are these numbers on the alert list of any Indian agency? No, but that doesn't mean... Of course, not. It doesn't mean that these numbers cannot be under suspicion. My lord, these 300 phone calls were made from five numbers. Here's the report from Telenor, Pakistan. The first number belongs to his cousin Dr Pervez Ahmed. The second number belongs to Sayyed Mohammed Naved, also his cousin. Then Sameena Begum, his cousin's wife. Mr Arshad Mumtaz and his wife Roohi Mohammed, cousins again. She is the same Roohi Mohammed from whom Bilaal Mohammed had borrowed 1500 dollars for his heart surgery, which he received on the day of the blast, coincidently. Mr Danish, do you believe in Islam? Yes, I do. - Objection, Your Honour. Why does a serving officer's religion matter in this case? Sir, I think the entire case is related to religion, and I shall prove that right now. Danish, do you believe that every Muslim is not a terrorist? Yes, I do. And is every Muslim a terrorist? I think so, based on my experience. What is the definition of terrorism, Danish? Objection, Your Honour. Will the definition of terrorism be written in court? The unlawful use of violence or intimidation especially against civilians in the pursuit of political or social aims. That's the definition of terrorism. Thank you. The unlawful use of violence or intimidation especially against civilians in the pursuit of political or social aims. Use of violence for political or social aims, especially against civilians. Am I right? - Yes. Did you notice there was no religion mentioned in the definition? - Yes. So, how can you decide this is terrorism and this is not? Danish, you can choose not to answer. Who decides this is terrorism and this is not? Objection, Your Honour. Is untouchability terrorism? Is assaulting the innocent tribal population terrorism? The upper class people humiliate the lower class, is that terrorism? - Objection, Your Honour. Or do you think Islamic terrorism is the only terrorism? - I object, Your Honour. Santosh, let me finish! For how many years have you been working in the anti-terrorist squad? I strongly object, Your Honour. For almost ten years. And how many Muslims are there in your team? I strongly object, Your Honour. Enough, Miss Aarti, there's no relevance. My lord, in this case, there has been a historical and mythological significance even of the names of the accused and his family, so, I... All right, go on, but come to the point soon. Thank you, sir. Tell me. How many Muslims are there in your team? Very few. Why? Because most of your targets are Muslims? Yes. In the heat of the moment, has it ever happened that your team forgot that you're Muslim yourself and said something offensive to Muslims in front of you? I don't remember. Don't remember? Or it never happened? Never? Maybe, but in the heat of the moment, sometimes... - Right. And did you ever feel that some people are bringing a bad name to the entire community? Every time. That's the point, my lord. This entire case is based on prejudice. The investigating officer of this case Danish Javed is a Muslim himself, is prejudiced that some people are bringing bad name to the entire community, and their agenda is to prove and to set an example that nobody becomes like Shahid. Right or wrong? Yes or no? Isn't it true that you could've arrested him? Yes or no, Officer Danish Javed? Objection, Your Honour. - You could've arrested him, but you killed him by shooting at him. Yes or no? Objection, Your Honour. - Don't you want to prove that nobody dares to become another Shahid? - I strongly object, Your Honour! The family too will meet the same fate! - Objection, Your Honour! Yes or no? - I strongly object! Did you want the same for this family? - Yes! Yes. That's all, my lord. You may go now. Santosh, closing arguments. My lord, there's a wonderful proverb. 'How will we convince them to be ours?' 'They don't consider us their kin.' Your Honour, two boys from this family knew a dreaded terrorist for a long time, and one of them killed 16 innocent Indians. The prosecution has produced the evidence to the court that this family made the plan in their Badar Manzil house. Nodal Officer Ajit Yadav produced the evidence. It is clear through CCTV footage that Bilaal Mohammed knew terrorist Mehfooz Alam for a long time, and he got 14 SIM cards activated for Mehfooz Alam without examining the documents, out of which, four SIM cards were used by the terrorists in Allahabad blast. There were several calls made from unknown numbers from Pakistan to Bilaal Mohammed and Ali Mohammed, and they also received a fee of 1500 US dollars exactly four hours after the blast. Murad Ali Mohammed has a history of 25 years being associated with rioters. Hence, the prosecution requests the court to grant Murad Ali Mohammed the most severe of punishments seeing which no citizen of the country will ever dare to involve in anti-national activities. According to the Indian Penal Code, there can't be nothing less than death penalty for this heinous crime. That's all, Your Honour. Aarti. Sir, it's a beautiful couplet. 'How will we convince them to be ours?' 'They don't consider us their kin.' Us and them. Us and them. Sir, tragically, this case is not about Shahid, Bilaal or Ali Mohammed. This case is about 'Us' and 'Them'. Judge, there are different kinds of people in this court. My family and I have to prove that we are innocent. Santosh Anand, Danish Javed and all these officers, have decided that this is a family of terrorists. These people too. They have nothing to do with this case. Few of them may be reporters, few people who are interested in this case, but I don't know if you noticed or not that whenever Santosh Anand made any accusation like, 'There are more kids in their community,' 'or the literacy level is less,' everyone used to laugh. Can you tell me what made you laugh? Can you tell me? Sir, can you tell me? They were laughing on the community with more children and lower literacy rates because that is his community, not theirs. Us and them. Sir, a country cannot be divided into parts by drawing lines on a paper. It is divided in our minds, by colour, language, religion, and caste. Santosh Anand has divided this country very beautifully in 'Us' and 'Them'. It is their punishment which Santosh Anand announced before you could give your verdict. He's taught them the same bias which he believes in. Judge, I am reiterating myself, this case is based on prejudice. Badar Manzil is the house which was built in 1927, a family lives in it, who chose the country when they had to choose between country or religion in 1947. This is a country where people speak 150 languages, follow many religions, how can you do justice with the bias between 'Us' and 'Them' in that country? I really don't understand. Gandhi was not killed by a community. He was killed by a man. You can't blame his community for his crime. Terrorism is a criminal act, not a communal act. If every Muslim is weighed in the same weighing scale, then one-fourth of the population of this world will be under suspicion. We have to find other ways, sir. Sonkar and Chaubey have to go to Ali Mohammed's house and tell him that they are with him. Aayat, Bilaal, Ali Mohammed will have to keep an eye on Shahid and Rashid. Only then, this country will become the best country in the world. The country can't stand divided. All of us are a part of this country. Shahid was responsible for his own death. Who will take the responsibility of Bilaal's death? He was unwell. The money that he saved for his treatment was considered as the fees for Jihad. Aayat lost her father, Tabassum lost her husband. Sir, who will look after them? Defence refutes all the allegations by the prosecution. I request the court that the accused should be acquitted. I rest my case here, sir. Thank you. I'll give the verdict in an hour, after the recess. You argued over two cases. I can give the verdict for one, not two. But I can suggest you something. Ali Mohammed, if anyone questions your beard hereafter, don't get emotional, and don't get angry. This book, the Constitution of India. Get three or four photocopies of the first page. Show that paper to anyone who questions you. If they still continue to trouble you, we'll handle it. These are fringe elements. You're getting them to the mainstream by reacting. Your brother died during the case, the court and I are sorry for the loss. I'm also upset that you couldn't control your son. You can't be punished for that. Control the guys, watch them, who they meet, what they watch, what booster antenna they use... Terrorists are not agents of Islam. They are misusing Islam for business and politics. If we acknowledge it, we'll find a way to escape from it. Danish, you're prejudiced against your own community. You must've known that. If you weren't, you would've filed a case instead of talking about Hawala for so many days. You are more interested in terrorism and encounters. Your focus is on that. Change your outlook, the world will look clearer to you. Santosh Anand, no one present in the court would know their grandparent's name. You're talking about a man named Bilaal from the 7th century. Is this how we are going to solve the problems of 2018? Who came first? Who came later? If we discuss this after 500 years, we'll lag 5000 behind. You lied in court. Abdul Kalam, Abdul Hamid and Bismillah Khan are exceptions in the Muslim community. You must have read this message on WhatsApp, right? Had you utilised your time to go through history, rather than watching news channels and using WhatsApp, you would've known how many Muslims are terrorists and how many of them have made our country proud. I can tell you the names, but it is not my job. As for the rest of you, Danish gave a definition of terrorism. Even after leaving this room, don't forget that. A bomb blast is an act of terrorism, but there are many more things that are acts of terrorism. If we don't allow lectures in the temple and prayers in the parliament, everything will be under control. Whenever someone tries to divide us, misguide us, go home and check the calendar, check how many days are left for the elections. Ali Mohammed, I acquit you. The court discards all the allegations on you. Wow. Law got the better of religion again today. Congratulations. Dad, I won. Very good. Come on. Will you forgive me? Had you told me earlier, this wouldn't have happened. Sir, if you look for love, you'll find it. Dear, I got Bilaal acquitted. "All the seven colours belong to my beloved." "O friend, you apply one colour to me." "All the seven colours belong to my beloved." "O friend, you apply one colour to me." "With all the seven..." "With all the seven colours, I got confused." "Some say it is green, some say it is orange." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "Kashi and Kaaba dwell in me." "Come to my house, let me welcome you at the door." "My beloved's religion is my love." "Why worry about reason? There is no inconvenience." "There is no inconvenience." "I am the sparrow on the temple's roof." "I live on the 'peepal' tree." "I am the pigeon on the roof of a mosque." "When I fly, it is dawn." "All colours define you." "My scarf is of rainbow colours." "I don't see my beloved directly." "But I see him through the eyes of my heart." "O my heart." "All the seven colours belong to my beloved." "O friend, you apply one colour to me." "All the seven colours belong to my beloved." "O friend, you apply one colour to me." "With all the seven..." "With all the seven colours, I became white." "Some say it is green, some say it is orange." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me." "My beloved dwells in me."
