[intense music] [engine revving] [music continues] [music continues] [door shuts] [dramatic music] [door closing] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] [door opens] [door opens] [switches flickering] [switches flickering] [switches flickering] Red-Two to Topkick. [instrumental music] Stand by. Red-Two reporting, sir. - Slater here. - General. All personnel dead, sir. No enemy force on site. Only security breach, a civilian van on the base but no driver to be found. Any evidence this was a preemptive CW strike? No, sir. Coming in. Go on in! [engine revving] [helicopter whirring] [dramatic music] [helicopter whirring] [music continues] (male #1) Sergeant. [music continues] Who the hell are you? Relax, Major, please. Take your finger off the trigger and I will explain. - That your van out by the gate? - Yeah. How'd you get into the complex? It's a complicated story, it starts a year ago but, um, let's skip that. Let me tell you about last night and this morning. Search him. What's that? Man your positions. Sunflower seeds. Get it analyzed. Who is this? The, uh, van driver, sir. Well, what the hell is he doing here? Sir, unidentified force. Range, 30 miles. - Closing from what direction? - Not closing, sir, outgoing. Check him out. And tell him to put his hands down. Yes, sir. What have you got? Estimated speed seven miles per hour, sir. Seven miles per hour? Whatever it is, it's big. Slater to Air-Search One. Contact and identify outgoing objects bearing 183 degrees. Distance, 30 miles estimated speed, 7 miles per hour. [intense music] (Slater on radio) Repeat, that's seven miles per hour not seven hundred. Air-Search One to Topkick, roger. [helicopter whirring] Air-Search One to Topkick. We have visual contact. Identify. A black mass. A moving black mass. Zero altitude, dead ahead. - They're hitting us! - Oh, my God! Well, what... We're outta... We're outta control! [both screaming] [music continues] [helicopter whirring] [crashing] [helicopter whirring] Oh, my God! Bees! Bees! Millions of bees! Air Search 2-8 to Base. Bees! Millions of bees! - Bees? - Yes! (man on radio) They're all around me now. All over the canopy, trying to get in! Well, get above 'em, man! Take it up! Ah, I can't, sir! I'm losing power! Oh, my God! [screaming] [helicopter whirring] [explosion] He's down, sir. Good Lord. Call Hastings Air Force Base. Have them scramble and track those bees. - This is Captain... - Major! Get me Hastings. Bring him in here! Hastings, this is Captain Cord of Marysville Missile Complex. This is a top priority order from General Slater. Scramble all aircraft and track a swarm of bees some 30 miles from missile complex. Yes, bees! Now, what's his story? - "Bradford Crane," sir. - Is that all? PhD, Institute of Advanced Study Princeton, via Cambridge. English? American for the last eight years. Well, Dr. Crane... ...you're in big trouble. What the hell are you doing in this complex? I saw the swarms coming up early this morning. There were so many, they almost blotted out the sun. I followed them, but when I got here, they were gone. Then I saw the missile gates open and I thought, perhaps, they'd flown down in here. So I came to see if there was anybody still alive if I could help. - What did you find in his van? - Scientific equipment, sir. What kind? Sabotage, explosives? What? Biological, sir. None of it looks lethal. Of course, we're still checking it out. - Who are you? - I'm an entomologist. - Bugs? - Insects, General. Look, what I do for a living is not important. What is important, critical is that there are probably other invading swarms. And what these bees did here they can do again all over the Southwest and, ultimately, all over the country. Are you trying to tell me bees killed the men here? Yes, just like they knocked your two choppers down. I don't know what happened to my two choppers, not yet but I do know that thousands of people are stung by bees every year. And it's damn rare if anybody dies from bee stings. Then they have to be African bees, then, don't they? The African killer bees? - Yes. - Not likely, Crane. I've read reports on their progress. If they ever do manage to come this far north it's ten years away at the earliest. Oh, yes? By whose timetable, General, yours or theirs? Crane, either you're some crackpot or there's a direct tie-up between what's happened in this complex and your being in it! Yes, well, we can clear that up fast, and we had just better. Now you kick on your visual-com system and patch through to Dr. Connors in the White House. Arthur Connors, the President's adviser? That's him. You trying to cite him as your authority for being in this complex? Dr. Connors hasn't the foggiest idea whether I'm on, off, on top of, or under this complex but I have to speak to him and I mean, right now! - Lock him up! - Yes, sir. General. Thank God you got here, sir. - What? - This is Dr. Anderson, sir. She managed to get six missile men into the hospital bunker and closed the interlock in time to isolate them. - Oh. - Two of them are dead. The other four are still critical. I need antitoxins. I have cardiopep compound in my van. Cardiopep? I just read an article in the medical journal about cardiopep by some scientist named Crane, I think. Our preliminary results are most encouraging. - You're Crane? - Yes. Our tests indicate that cardiopep normalizes irregular heartbeat. Now, wait a minute, we're not using experimental substances on these men. But, sir, this is his area. It seems to me that if he feels-- Captain, I don't give a damn what he feels. You're the doctor, you tell me what antitoxins you need I'll have 'em here in less than 30 minutes. Well, that's the problem, sir, I don't really know. None of the usual procedures seem to be helping. I need to talk to an immunologist. Get Atlanta on the horn. National Center for Disease Control. The best immunologist in the country is Walter Krim, in Virginia. You'll find his card in my wallet. Call him. - Go ahead. - I know him very well. I'd be pleased to talk to him, if you let me. Alright. Go with him. Go with him. Now, what happened here, Captain? I'm sorry, sir. You mean, you don't know? Well, uh, not-not exactly. We were attacked by bees. Attacked? I was in the hospital bunker when I heard the alarm. I turned on the video-control unit saw what was happening. Our men above ground were literally covered with bees. I used an air-conditioning duct to get over to pod-3 and lead the stand-by crew out. The bees attacked us when we reached the hospital bunker. I managed to get six men inside. Hm... Well, it's damn hard to believe that insects have accomplished what nothing in the world could've done except, germ warfare or a neutron bomb... ...neutralize an ICBM site. [bees buzzing] [engine revving] Okay, let's go. Come on, Paul. - Alright. - Wow. Isn't this beautiful? Neat. Here, Paul, take this. - Here you go, hon. Hm. - Thanks, babe. Hey, Paul, look at that over there. I think there's a waterfall we can go to afterwards. [birds chirping] [intense music] - Hand the cups, please. Thank you. - Sure. Paul, would you go to the car and get the thermos? Sure, mom. - Go away. - Yeah, it's just a bee. If you leave 'em alone, they won't bother you. They're into everything. [bees buzzing] I'll get them. Get out of the way, honey. Think that's enough. You're gonna wreck the food. [sighs] I'm hungry. Oh, it's hot. Mm. - Hey, wait for Paul. - I can't. I'm starving. Mom, dad, look! [bees buzzing] Oh! [screaming] Dad! Come on, get in the car! [Screaming] Run! [dramatic music] [screaming] [groaning] [groaning] [screaming] Mom! Dad! [bees buzzing] Mom! [bees buzzing] Mom! Da-a-ad! [intense music] [engine revving] Mom! Dad! Mom! Oh.. [engine revving] [device beeping] General Thompson coming on-screen. General, we've received and decoded your report. Now, we're having credibility problems with that portion which relates to the nature of the attack specifically, with your statement it was not a preemptive chemical warfare strike. We can find no evidence of that, sir. Your suggestion that the attack is of natural origin. Now, what the hell is that? Sir, I'm having the same problem accepting the fact that swarms of bees attacked-- Has that civilian with you been cleared, General? No, sir. Then what the hell is he doing in our complex? Well, after the alert when I arrived with my special defense unit he was already inside the complex. Claims he walked in through the open gate. I am Dr. Brad Crane, an entomologist. I have asked your man here to check my credentials with Dr. Arthur Connors in the White House. So far nobody believes me and I have been placed in custody. General, every minute now is precious. We have been invaded by an enemy far more lethal than any human force. Well, Dr. Crane, we're gonna check with the White House. Dr. Connors had better know you for your sake. [device beeping] [car honking] [engine rumbling] - Afternoon, Felix. - Afternoon, ma'am. How are you feeling today? Now that you're here, I'm just doin' fine. Thank you. Nicely said. Well, everything's looking mighty pretty, Maureen. - And that's including you. - Thank you, Clarence. The wire and the pliers, please. Oh. Felix, you think that riggin' of yours is gonna keep my banner up there? Uh, Clarence, just because you're the mayor of Marysville that doesn't make you an engineer. Now, don't you be worrying about my rigging, Clarence. She'll stay up there in a hurricane. Now, I was just thinking how corny your banner reads. Makes us all look like a bunch of hicks. Look, nobody ask you to leave Houston and come here to retire, you know? Now, Clarence, that's not nice. Well, we've been doing just fine with our Flower Festival for years until this master mechanic and all-around-genius came here to tell us all how to run things. Well, actually, the sign is sort of hicky but that's what people expect from us. The hammer, too. That's why they flock here by the thousands each year to see the parade and all our beautiful flower floats. That's right, we'll grant you, Felix, this isn't Pasadena. I mean, it isn't the Rose Bowl but it's, by golly a pretty fair country-town imitation. I'll tell you one thing I do approve of. This year's theme. Love. Now, that was Clarence's idea. That's right. Well, everybody's got to have one good idea now and then. - Even Clarence. - Now look, Felix. [car honking] [tires screeching] [car honking] Mom, dad. [car honking] [tires screeching] [breathing heavily] [tires screeching] [car honking] [tires screeching] [panting] [crashing] [clattering] [indistinct yelling] Paul. [breathing heavily] They-they killed my mom and my dad! [breathing heavily] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We'll do the best we can, sir, and thank you, sir. - Captain Jones you have online? - Yes, General. [device beeping] General Thompson coming on-screen. Dr. Crane... ...your credentials have been authenticated. Nothing more? Well, I confess to being surprised over the turn of events but the president has instructed me to place you in direct command of all operations relating to this present emergency. What are the limits to my authority? [sighs] None. General Slater. Yes, sir. You will provide Dr. Crane with full cooperation. You will give him the full equipment whatever facilities, manpower he needs. All this to be made available to him without question. Without question, sir? Affirmative. - Dr. Crane. - Yes? The president's adviser, Dr. Connors told me he'll personally be calling you within an hour. And I'd like to join with him in wishing you good luck. Thank you. [device beeping] Major, when you checked the non-lethal equipment in my van did you by any chance come across a beat-up briefcase? Yes, sir. Are you familiar with its contents? Yes, sir, an inventory of the contents is in the process of being typed. Correction, sir. Was being typed. Thank you. I want the particular file that I'd marked Personnel to give to General Slater. Yes, sir. And while you're about it could I have my leather pouch, please? The one with the sunflower seeds in it. Sergeant, would you get the items he requested? The file contains the names, addresses and telephone numbers of everyone I want flown in. Just tell them the war that I've always talked about has finally started. - Mm-hmm. - Hm. That's all, huh? - And they'll drop everything? - I'm counting on it. - Anything else? - Yes. In that same briefcase there is a list of equipment. And I'd appreciate it if you got the Pentagon's top procurement man on the job and had him get everything on that list flown down here not later than this time tomorrow. Why here? Because we're setting up headquarters here, General. Time is the one thing we're short on. Now, I want to talk to the survivors, please. Take Dr. Crane to Captain Anderson. Yes, sir. Would you come with me, please? Yes. [sighs] Brother. Major... ...I believe you were an investigative officer in Intelligence prior to your assignment to me, right? That's correct, sir. Okay. I'm assigning you to this Dr. Crane as his personal military liaison. Watch every move he makes. Build me a dossier on him. I can't believe he just happened to be here at the exact moment a swarm of bees hit this complex and that he'd already prepared with such remarkable foresight... ...a list of personnel and equipment to be flown in here. It does seem strange, sir. You stay with the son of a bitch. Yes, sir. [device beeping] (Anderson) This man is the most stable of the four but his heart rate is still 120. Take another blood sample from these men just before Dr. Krim gets here. That'll be, uh, three hours at the outside. Infirmary. Major Baker. Mm-hmm. Well, hold on a minute. Captain Anderson. Dr. Anderson. Oh, my God! Yes. Yes. - I'm leaving right now. - What is it? [panting] The bees are moving toward Marysville. They've killed all the Durant family, except Paul. - I must go to him. - Yes, I-I'll go with you. Major, you drive. [engines revving] [indistinct chattering] [indistinct chattering] Paul Durant. - C-4. - Thank you. [screaming] [breathing heavily] Ah, there's a bee in here! Please, help! [screaming] There's a bee in here! [screaming] Get him out of here! - Paul, take it easy, Paul. - Please. Please! Get him away! Kill him! There's a big bee... - Paul. - Doctor. Would you let him go, please? Let him go. - Do what he says, Tomas. - Back away. - Back away. - There's a bee. Help. Paul, Paul, listen to me. There is no bee, no bee in this room. No, there isn't. You are having a nightmare. Only a nightmare. Can you hear me, Paul? The bee is not real. I.. Paul, I promise you it isn't. Now reach out and it will go away. You'll see. Now, please, Paul, reach out. Reach out, Paul. Please trust me. Reach out. Further. Go on. There. You see, Paul? No bee. Everything I tried failed. I was afraid I was gonna lose him. I know how special he is to you, Dr. Anderson, so I called you. - Thank you. - How many times was he stung? I removed two stingers from him. Well, that's one break. At least he's not pump full of venom. But he's delirious muttering about this giant bee all the time. I-it was, it was big! It was really big. About half the size of this room. Shh, shh. It's gone now, Paul. It was only in your mind and he won't be back. I have to go. Dr. Crane. Thank you for helping me. [door shuts] [engine revving] Contact the complex, please. Two things. General Slater must assign helicopters to start a search pattern radiating out from the site where the Durant family were attacked but the helicopters must take no aggressive action if they spot any swarms. We're gathering information at this point not counter-attacking. - Clear? - Clear. Second item, have the complex call me the moment that Dr. Krim is about to land. [engine revving] [helicopters whirring] Here come your choppers, as ordered. Thank you, General. No, thanks. High in potassium, low in sodium. Terrific. [helicopters whirring] Sergeant, start your patterns. Start your dispersal pattern in sectors A and B. Report immediately any sighting of swarms. (man on radio) Roger. [helicopters whirring] If you tell us what you're looking for, we'll try to help. I'm looking for bees, General. Unfortunately, they washed down the Durant car before we got to it. Look. Doesn't look like a bee to me. Plastic. It's a piece of a plastic cup. There are pieces all around here. Look. Look, there, there, there. What's so significant about that? I'm afraid to speculate... ...but...I think the bees did this. You-you saying these bees eat plastic? No, no, but I'm wondering. Pure American honey bee has a weak mouth. They couldn't even break the skin of a grape but it looks like this species is tearing up plastic cups possibly, to line their hives. Now, if this is true they didn't just get here. I mean, the invasion didn't just now begin. They have been here some time... ...breeding, increasing. SQ? Well, suppose these bees are using plastic to insulate their hives. - No bee is that smart. - Hm. Suppose these African bees are. [helicopter whirring] - Walter! - Ah. Got a message for you from Mrs. Krim. I know, Carol is furious at me for dragging you back to work, right? She wants to know if you think I'm the only immunologist in the world. Well, that's what you've always told me. You're ready to go to work, Dr. Krim? Now I am, Dr. Crane. [chuckles] Oh, uh, this is General Slater. Hello, doctor. Just let me know what you need. We'll be right on it. Thank you, General. We've got to move fast. I agree, and in my opinion the fastest move is a quick knockout. Not necessarily, General. It's only the final result that counts. Thank you, Brad. [wheelchair squeaking] [wheelchair squeaking] These hallucinations seem to be disappearing. That's right. None of the patients have had a recurrence in the past couple of hours. Well, you're doing everything you can for them. Just keep these IVs going. Yes, sir. Is there any other antitoxin we could've used? If this fellow behind me is right and the bees that stung 'em were Africans the answer's probably no. Got nothing in our bag for them, not yet anyway. Maybe Cardiopep might have eased their palpitations but it's no final antidote. Be sure and call me if there's any change in these men. Yes, sir. They don't look very good, do they? I'm afraid not. [wheelchair squeaking] So you still refuse to oil this thing, huh? I don't intend to be stuck in this damn thing forever. You've finally met some miracle healer or what? I'm studying Tibetan levitation. In a few hundred years or so I expect to be able to just float around. You still writing dirty books? Not this year. Raunchiest thing I ever read, that paper of yours on the mating habits of Bombus medius. Yeah, those queen bees really are something. Sergeant, this is Dr. Krim. The two officers with Major Baker are doctors Richards and Moore. And until they finish their work, you don't admit anyone. [device beeping] [wheelchair squeaking] Have someone oil these wheels later. Brad. You okay, Brad? - Yeah. - You go on now. I'll handle this part and call you when I'm ready. Walter... ...thanks for coming over here so quickly. (Baker) Problem, doctor? About what? Well, I noticed that, uh Dr. Crane seemed uneasy in here. Can't imagine why anybody'd be uneasy around all these dead men. Can you, Major? Well, is the man coming or isn't he? Yes, sir, the general is coming but you still have to wait outside. [engine revving] [brakes squeaking] What the hell is this about shutting off our water? Are you the man in charge here? That's right. I'm General Slater. Well, I'm Jud Hawkins. I asked these tin soldiers of yours if I could see my son and they tell me it's impossible, no way. Who is your son? Why do you think he's here? Because he was stupid enough to join your damn outfit, that's why. His name is Mark, Airman Mark Hawkins and he's stationed here and I want to see him. Well, I'm afraid that might not be possible, Mr. Hawkins. - Not just yet. - Well. I'll tell you what makes it possible. Me being the county engineer. That makes it right now, can do, possible. - Do you understand me, General? - Out of the question. Look, I throw the switches that controls all that damn water in this county and, by God, I'll shut yours off unless I get to see my son. I'll shut this whole damn base down in ten minutes. Why, you won't even have enough water to flush your toilets when I get through with you. I'm not sure you have the authority to do that to a federal installation. Well, while you're checking with your superiors to find out if I've got the authority I'm gonna be a-turning those valves. Now you listen to me, General. The word in town is that them same bees that killed the Durant family this afternoon killed a whole lot of men on this base here this morning. Now, I wanna see my son. I want to find out if he's alive and I mean right now! Alright, Mr. Hawkins. Open it up. [Slate opens] Come with me. [dramatic music] Anything? The toxic content in their tissue is the highest I've ever found. It's even more virulent than the venom of the Australian brown-box jellyfish. If that baby taps you, you got two minutes to say your prayers. Well, I... - That's it, then? - Yup. Looks like your nightmare has finally arrived. The combined venom delivered by the stingers of three or more of these bees may be a fatal dosage to the average human being. The victim would be unconscious in a minute. We've been fighting a losing battle against the insects for 15 years... ...but I never thought I'd see the final face-off in my lifetime. And I never dreamed that it would turn out to be the bees. They've always been our friends. Until this species evolved. Sir, General Slater is just outside with next of kin of one of the dead men. He wants to come in here? He said it was imperative. [music continues] Alright. [music continues] [music continues] [sobbing] Oh, God! No! [sobbing] [music continues] I'm afraid you can't take him, Mr. Hawkins. The only way you can stop me to is to shoot me... ...and I'd thank you if you would. [music continues] [Hawkins sobbing] [helicopter whirring] Hubbard. Dr. Newman. Thank you for coming so quickly. Glad to help, Dr. Crane. Crane, I think you should know I came here reluctantly. Well, that's better than not at all... ...now, isn't it? This way, gentlemen. Would you excuse me a moment, please? Major Baker, when the others arrive give them 30 minutes, no more, to shower and unpack... ...and then have them go to the briefing room. - Very well, sir. - Gentlemen. Rude son of a bitch, isn't he? Never even introduced us. You'd think he was a general. He's asked for the duty watch tapes. Why? Well, he seems to know all about the fact that there's an automatic, round the clock taping system in the duty room. He wants to audit the tape for the period just prior to the bee attack. I've already played them back. Not a damn thing on it that'll help us. Alright, go ahead. Let him hear it. And stay with him. - Build up that dossier. - Yes, sir. (male #2 on recorder) So, what are you gonna do about Rita? (male #3 on recorder) She's been slinging hash at Pete's long enough. I'm gonna marry her. (male #2) Hey, guys don't do that anymore just 'cause they're gonna have a kid. (male #3) Hey, man, I love Rita. I'd marry her whether we were gonna have a kid or not. (automated voice on recorder) At the tone, mark 0-4-30. [beeping on recorder] (male #2) It says here on the watch order we're scheduled to run a test on the alarm system right after the 0-4-30 mark. (male #3) Okay. Stand by. Activating. [alarm blaring on recorder] What alarm system is that? It's a fallback system in case we lose the phone lines or radio contact. [alarm continues] What's that? Just the alarm. No, listen, listen. [buzzing on recorder] (male #2 on recorder) Jerry, do you hear what I'm hearing? - Yeah. - Duty officer. - What is it? - Right away, sir. (Jerry on recorder) A couple million chain saws! [male #4 screaming on recorder] (Jerry) That came from the corridor. Cover me. I'll go look. (male #2) Je-Jerry! Behind you! - Ah! - My God! Dr. Crane, they're ready for you now, sir. Okay. Keep the tapes on the machine. I want to hear them again. [machine beeping] [machine beeping] [indistinct chatter] How's Paul doing? Recovering, thank you. That's good. [indistinct chatter] Good morning, ladies...gentlemen. Please forgive the haste and the secrecy... ...with which you have been summoned here. The fact is... ...we have been invaded by a mutant species of the African killer bee. Crane, if I may. Yes, Dr. Hubbard? As you know, I was sent by the President here to help out but I think you are dead wrong. Now, I was one of the first people sent to Brazil to study the situation when the African killer bee began proliferating there. Incidentally, we'd prefer to call these mutants the Brazilian bee, not the African. Yes, I'm very well aware of that, Dr. Hubbard. (Dr. Hubbard) Well, I've been keeping track of their, uh, progress North and I can assure you, there is no evidence whatsoever that they've yet crossed Central America. Let alone...arrived here. Apparently, they came directly across the Caribbean from Venezuela. There have been three hurricanes in that ocean tract in the past season. Any one of them could have swept the bees in. Much of the land around here is given over to the cultivation of flowers. A perfect breeding ground. [indistinct chatter] Gentlemen, with all appropriate respect for the men who died here... ...there is no proof that the bees that killed them were Brazilian. Or, if you insist, African. What we call 'em is not as important as what they are. And what they are quite clearly is a mutant species of the original African killer bee. Dr. Krim will explain. The autopsies confirm that the venom... ...is deadlier than anything we've ever encountered. It appears there's enough poison in just four stings to...kill the average person. Well, I will not dispute my learned colleague but it takes 26 tests to differentiate between the domestic bee and the African. How many tests have you made so far? Major. You are now looking at the final test that I made this morning... ...from the one dead bee that we found. You'll please notice the 18-vein intersection on the forewing... ...and the 17 separate angles of the hamuli. Only one bee... ...has that configuration... ...and that is the African killer bee. [indistinct chatter] Major. Dr. Hubbard... ...I would appreciate it if you would head up our environmental team. Dr. Newman will be in charge of the genetic counter-attack. Dr. Krim will try to develop a mass antidote... ...in order to save the lives of future victims. Because of the danger to nearby Marysville if the bees launch another attack... ...I've invited his honor Mayor Tuttle and the school superintendent Miss Schuster to attend this briefing. Any comment? Mayor Tuttle. Thank you. In the view of what you've told us I'll set up a meeting of the town council as soon as possible. Uh, first thing I'll see to is that our air-raid warning system is repaired. It hasn't worked in...quite some time. Then if the bees should come back at least we'll be able to warn our people to take shelter. (Dr. Crane) A very practical approach, Mayor Tuttle. Miss Schuster. Well, the whole idea of those killer bees comin' back is absolutely petrifying. I'll alert all my teachers to be prepared for the worst. I do appreciate your thoughtfulness in asking us to this briefing. Thank you, Dr. Crane. (Dr. Crane) You're welcome, Miss Schuster. Any further comment? Uh, what is our timetable? Eight-hours on, eight-hour off round the clock, seven days a week. No, no, I meant, uh.. What's the length of our program? Uh, how long can we expect to be here? Until we have destroyed... ...the African bee... ...or it has destroyed us. [instrumental music] [panting] [sighs] [music continues] [clattering] [music continues] Psst! Hey! - Hey, you guys ready? - Yeah, we're ready! Well, c'mon, give me the binoculars and let's go. Okay, let's go. [music continues] - Mornin'. - Hi! Hi, boys! Morning, Rita. Morning, Mr. Austin. Instead of the usual I'll just have coffee this morning. - Alright. - I'll get it, Rita. Morning, Felix! A man would think you'd let her have some time off, Pete. At least let her go to the missile base and... ...pick up Jerry's things. I told her! I even said to her, I said "Rita... "...why don't you go home for a few days pull yourself together." But she said... "...If I was to go home... "...stare at them four walls "knowin' I'd never see Jerry again... "...I'm just liable to take his service pistol "and blow my head off." Now, that's what she said. No, I reckon she's better off here pretending it never happened. Pretending them killer bees never got up here. I bet I can guess what school teacher them roses belongs to. [chuckles] You don't need no crystal ball for that. Yup, the way I hear it is Maureen is favorin' you over Clarence. - I sure am counting on it. - Yes, sir. The gossip is the odds have shifted in your favor. Now, them is my kind of odds. [laughs] - Well, I gotta be goin'. - So soon? Yeah, but I'll be seein' you. - Okay, have a good day. - Yeah, thank you. [instrumental music] - Oh, Maureen. - Mornin', Felix. - Got you some roses. - Oh, Felix. They are lovely. I usually get apples. [chuckles] Oh, Maureen. I, uh... Something wrong, Felix? Oh, Maureen, I'm not too good with words... ...but I am a retired master mechanic... ...and my education... ...well...it's all in these hands. [music continues] And I know you know what I'm trying to say. Your roses speak for you. Most eloquently. Thank you. And I'm mindful of it. Then there is hope for me? Oh, look at the time. I'd better hurry. How'd it look for me to be late for school? [chuckles] Let me help you. And I'll keep your roses near me. [chuckles] Thank you. As a reminder. Thank you. (Felix) I'll be seeing you real soon. You will. - Bye. - Bye. [music continues] [bees buzzing] [dramatic music] [sighs] We'll come back later. We have to plan this just right. 'Cause these aren't just any old bees. [buzzing continues] This is your reporter, Anne MacGregor. We're about to leave for Marysville to investigate the report of an unusual and savage attack by bees at a family picnic. It resulted in the death of a mother and father and serious injury to their young son. My next report will be from Marysville... - Kill it. - Yes, sir. We've picked up a massive swarm, sir. On this scale that puts it only 200 miles from Houston. I can have choppers there in half an hour. We'll eliminate them before they get away. With what? Airborne chemical agents. May we talk? Alone? Sure. I don't recall our discussing the need to use chemicals agents. Now, listen... My orders are to assist you in your scientific endeavors. Not to consult with you on military matters... ...which are none of your damn concern, sir! General, please. These bees, General, are of joint concern. And they are killing Americans without reference as to whether or not they have a serial number and are expected to salute you! So there will be no airdrops of any kind... ...until I give the okay! Your okay, huh? Then just possibly I can persuade you to attack this particular swarm. Now that we know where it is... ...attack and eliminate it! Possibly, if you can explain to me... ...how you airdrop chemicals without killing the native insect life. If your chemical will kill the African bee it will also kill the American bee, right? Right. And better a few American bees than a lot of American people. That is the point, General! The honey bee is vital to the environment! Every year in America they pollinate six billion dollars worth of crops! If you kill the bee, you're gonna kill the crop! If you kill the plants, you'll kill the people! No! No, General! There will be no airdrop until we know exactly what we're dropping... ...and where...and how! Excuse me. What about the airdrop, sir? Sir? - The 0-4-30 mark. - Okay. (Jerry on recorder) Stand by. Activating. [ticking] [buzzing on recorder] (male #2 or recorder) Jerry, do you hear what I'm hearing? (Jerry) Yeah. What is it? Sounds like a couple million chain saws! [male #4 screaming on recorder] (Jerry) That came from the corridor. Cover me. I'll go look. (male #2) J-Jerry! Behind you! [male #4 screaming on recorder] My God! [Jerry screams on recorder] Oh, God, no! No! [bees buzzing] [dramatic music] Come on, let's get them! [panting] We've got to kill them this time! Ready, now! [bottles shattering] Let's get out of here! [buzzing] [music continues] [bees clinking] [music continues] [car engine revving] [sighs] I can't imagine where he's gone. We've looked everywhere. He's been running a fever. I got him back to the clinic right after the funeral but the minute I left, he disappeared. We'll find him. With everything else you've got on your shoulders you really didn't need this too. I know I'm taking you away from all your responsibilities. Paul is one of them. Besides... ...I like being with you. You're the one positive thing that's happened to me here. I like that. I really do. What is it? [dramatic music] Look. The bees. They're heading toward Marysville. [indistinct chatter] - Wait. - Hey, wait for me. [instrumental music] - I'll beat you outside! - No, you won't. Now, Miss Cook? In a minute, Mr. Tuttle. Is this what you want? No, I need a note from your mother. (Miss Cook) Now, Mr. Tuttle. Oh, thank you. Would you excuse me? That'd be alright. Well, Clarence, who's minding the store? [exhales] Maureen, how long have we known each other? Clarence, maybe you'd better sit down. Uh, no, no, thanks, I'll stand. How long? Well, I can remember you in short pants. But I just soon not figure out how long ago that was. In all that time, have you ever heard me beg? [laughs] Oh, not you, Clarence. You're the original high-spirited, independent soul. Uh. Well, Maureen... ...I'm willing to beg now. [telephone rings] Yes? Blue will do. Where was I? Uh... Oh, yeah. Maureen, I want you to marry me. [instrumental music] Oh, Clarence... ...do sit down. Uh, you just name the date and I'll make all the arrangements. Well, I'm not sure I'm the wife you need. Oh, you'd make the best wife in the world. Well, Clarence, I think I'm already married completely married to this school. Maureen, I love you. Oh, I know people look at me and think I'm just an old man behind the aspirin counter but in my heart I'm as young as I ever was. Maybe younger. And I want to take care of you. Oh... Thank you, Clarence. Well, I guess I have to choose, don't I? I, uh...I guess that's about what it comes down to. [telephone rings] Please hold the calls. Maureen, I, I know I may not win out... ...because, for all my pretending I can't stand Felix, I... ...I know he's a fine man and he'd make a good husband. But I know one thing... ...I love you. I always have... ...and I'll, I always will. No matter...what you decide. How lucky I am. Well... ...alright. I'll give you both my answer before the end of this school term. How's that? That's, uh, fair enough, I guess. Oh, I...I brought these for you. Thank you. [music continues] [engine revving] Why'd they send us varsity way out here? Any stringer could've covered this story. You're wrong, Hal. This isn't just a story about a family killed by bees. Something else is going on around here. I can feel it. We're first national news people on the spot. Okay, Anne, if you say so. Well, let's check in. [horn blows] Get back. [tires screeching] (male #5) Yeah, I've got it right here in front of me. - The African bees! - Call you back. The African bees that killed Paul's mother and father are back! Get everyone inside and everything locked up! You call the park! You call the ball field! I'm calling the school! [siren blaring] (Crane) Get inside! The bees are coming! [clamoring] [sirens blaring] Get inside! The killer bees are coming! Everybody get inside. Do you understand? Maureen, those killer bees are coming in. Get all the kids off the playground into the building. Don't you understand? The killer bees are coming! Get inside immediately. (Anderson) Get all the children! Get them inside! (Crane) Take any children you see with you! Quickly, get inside! Quickly, take your children with you! If you see any children alone, take them in! Get inside the house! Keep all the air conditioning vents closed and don't let anybody out until you get an all clear from me. I understand. I'll do it immediately. Attention. Attention. This is Miss Schuster. Please listen very carefully. A swarm of killer bees is coming this way. I want every teacher and every student to close off whatever area you may be in at this very moment. [screaming] [buzzing] [dramatic music] [children screaming] Children! Children! It's all right. It's alright. Quiet. Quiet. [buzzing continues] [crying] [buzzing continues] Here they come. Inside, fast. Get it all on tape! [sirens blaring] Close your windows, close your doors! Stay inside! Please, listen to us! Run! [buzzing continues] [music continues] [screaming] [screams] Brad! Get some ice! [buzzing continues] [music continues] [screaming] [buzzing continues] [music continues] [screaming] [glass shatters] They're coming in here! [screams] - Is there a freezer? - Yes, around this way. Get in it. [screams] Mr. Harris! He's locked it! Hey! [sobbing] - Is he crazy? - He's afraid. Mr. Harris is afraid of everything! Aren't we safe in here? I don't know. No, the air conditioning is on. They'll come through the vents. Just a minute. It's 40 degrees in here. We'll be alright for a while. Bees don't function well in temperatures under 50. [panting] Helena! Helena? [panting] Helena? [groans] This is Anne MacGregor reporting from Marysville. The swarm left behind it a devastated community. The town's people are still reeling under the impact of the vicious raid that left many of their friends or relations dead or dying. Marysville have been preparing for its annual Flower Festival. And authorities speculate the nearby fields in full bloom... (Frank) This is Frank Blair in New York. We are awaiting a statement from the President's chief adviser Dr. Arthur Connors in the White House. Dr. Connors is currently evaluating data from Bradford Crane... ...said to be one of the leading authorities on the deadly African bee. Crane is now at the scene of the tragedy. - Dr. Krim. - Are we able to locate him? We're trying to get to him on our mobile units. Please, stand by, sir. (Frank on TV) Every opening into homes churches, schools, and offices is being closed tight. Scientific authorities are warning against overreacting to the threat. Scientists are of the opinion that the Marysville tragedy is a freak localized phenomenon and could not possibly be repeated. (male #6) Take it easy. Okay, there we go. [clamoring] (female #1) Come this way. [indistinct chatter] (male #7) Clear the way, please. [sirens blaring] [telephone rings] - Hello. - Krim here. Oh, hi, Walter, it's Brad. I just heard about Helena. - Is she alright? - Still unconscious. - Not good. - How are things back there? Damned unsettling development here. One of those four survivors of the initial attack... Yes? Higgins, the airman... ...with only two stings, he just died. - What happened? - I don't know. He was doing fine. I was even thinking of releasing him. Within the matter of minutes his condition turned critical. All the classical signs of cardiovascular failure. He was gone before we could reverse it. Keep those three survivors there until we could plot some kind of recovery versus relapse pattern. How bad is it in Marysville? About as bad as it can get. Two hundred and sixteen dead... ...thirty-three victims still alive. We haven't got a count yet on the number of stings... Tomas... We're too damn busy trying to stabilize 'em. [whispers] Dr. Crane. I'm sorry. I've got to go, Walter. Bye. Is it me you're seeing, or a bee? [chuckles] You. - Uh, Dr. Crane. - Yes? General Slater is out front on the horn with Washington. He requests your presence, sir. Alright, I'll be back. - I'll be up. - Oh, no, you won't. Paul. Paul, what's the matter? It's all my fault. I threw firebombs at the swarm. Oh, Paul. Paul. You know you're going to have to tell Dr. Crane. [sighs] [sniffles] Well, I'd like to, General but the civilian Crane is in charge. I just follow orders. (Thompson) I'll check 'em out back here. Right, I'll keep in touch. (Crane) General. Well, Crane... ...it's panic time from coast to coast. If we'd gone after the bees right at the beginning instead of wasting time tooling up those science teams of yours we wouldn't be in this damn mess! Okay, if you were in charge, what would you do? I'd evacuate this area. Put up roadblocks across the state. And spray the hell out of every tree and bush from here to the gulf. Right, now let's take that a piece at a time. Why evacuate? Your Dr. Hubbard was out collecting live Africans. He has brought 'em back to the complex. - Many? - Thousands. How'd he manage that? They were on the surface of the lake outside the town. Thirsty and exhausted. Well, that's good news. - We need specimens. - Now, hold it. Hold it. I don't see it that way. The rest of that particular swarm could still be in the area. - Major. - Sir. - Get the final body count. - Yes, sir. - General. - Yes. You haven't answered my question yet. - What question? - Why evacuate? I've been trying to tell you... ...when that swarm finds out some of their friends have been taken captive they might come back to Marysville. Are you endowing these bees with human motives? Like saving their fellow bees from captivity? Or seeking revenge on mankind? I always credit my enemy no matter what he may be... ...with equal intelligence. Okay. Evacuate Marysville, but not the complex. We will not waste our time moving our facilities! - Agreed. - Now... About this, um... ...spraying every bush and tree between here and the gulf... ...how will you manage that? Send out aircraft. With radar and pesticides I'd track down and destroy every African swarm in this country, wherever they are! - Sir. - Major? Two hundred and thirty-two dead, sir. "Two hundred and thirty-two dead." I know that, General. But how will you prevent the wind from carrying your pesticides across cities parks, farms and schools? Sometimes, you have to choose the lesser of two evils. Ridiculous, General! You want action and so do I! Well, we do it my way! Now, give it a chance! (Paul) Dr. Crane! Dr. Crane! - I gotta talk to you. - Okay. It was my fault... ...what happened here with the bees. I knew where they were... ...and I should've told you. Yeah. Why didn't you, Paul? Because they killed my family! I wanted to get 'em. And I did! I got a lot of 'em. And the rest of them flew in the air and... Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Paul. Come on. I'd have done the same thing. - Mm-mm. - The exact same thing. [exhales] You gotta believe me. Now...look at me, Paul. Look at me. When I was a little younger than you... ...just about seven... ...we had a fire where we lived. And I lost my mother and father... ...that night. It's not good to have to grow up... ...without a mother and father. You can ask me. I know firsthand. I know a lot of unlucky kids all over the world have to... ...but it sure isn't recommended, you know. Now... ...why don't you go back upstairs... ...and just... ...sort of keep an eye on Dr. Anderson for me? Hm? - Will you do that? Okay? - Yeah, okay. Good boy. Okay, go. - Dr. Crane. - Yes? Anne MacGregor. Can you give us 90 seconds? What could I possibly tell you in 90 seconds, Miss MacGregor. Just tell us everything you can, doctor no matter how long it takes. Give me one second for my lead-in. This is Anne MacGregor. I'm outside the medical clinic in Marysville, Texas, with me is Dr. Bradford Crane who is field director for Dr. Connors the President science adviser, well, Dr. Crane... ...how can you keep a repetition of this terrible tragedy from happening in other parts of the country? Do you have any answers for us yet on that? At the moment, none. Do you mean that the death toll from killer bee attacks can spread? There is that possibility. Yes. What is the government doing? What are your science teams working on? Positive ways to isolate and eliminate invading swarms. What positive ways? Can you be specific, doctor? That's tough to do in 90 seconds, Miss MacGregor. Take all the time you want, doctor. I'm afraid that's the point. We really don't have any to spare. Would you excuse me, please. Thank you, Dr. Crane. (Anne) Anne MacGregor. Marysville, Texas. [engine revving] [intense music] [engine revving] [buzzing] [door buzzes] [bees buzzing] (Hubbard) DC ready. Not exceeding five volts. (Krim) Testing dry volts. Good. DC activated. - How's it going? - We'll be ready in a minute. (Hubbard) Honey-coated. Three volts at 0.5 amps. (Krim) Okay, bring on the gladiators. I'll stir them up. [bees buzzing] (Krim) Pesky little devils. Spread 'em all over the grid. They're getting ready to attack. [buzzing continues] (Krim) They're stinging the hell out of the grid. We're getting plenty of venom now. Great, we need all we can get. [buzzing continues] If there's a positive side to the tragedy at Marysville... ...it's gonna be these Africans and the queen bees. With all this venom, I can really go to work on an antidote. That's fine. But, Hubbard... ...can you have your poison pallet ready by morning? By morning? I don't see how. Well... That makes your deadline even earlier, Walter. Smells like bananas. See how fast it dries. [door buzzes] - Any further complications? - No, sir. Dr. Anderson has just examined them, and they're doing well. Dr. Anderson? When did she get back on her job? A short while ago, Major. I couldn't rest at the clinic knowing I had sick patients here. Besides, Dr. Martinez says, I'm fine. Well, good. Captain, I've been planning on, uh having a little private talk with you. Yes, Major. It's about the civilian, Crane. I've, uh, received confidential reports about your association with him. Reports which indicate that your relationship is now of a personal nature? I wasn't aware you had assigned anyone to spy on me. Has Crane asked you anything about our operations here no matter how indirect? Why should he? Dr. Crane is a highly respected scientist and has been appointed by the President to head this project. Ah-ha, but still, Captain, it might be advisable for you to discontinue the relationship. With all due respect, sir what I do on my off-duty time is my own business and does not concern the Air Force. I shall continue to see whomever I wish. [door buzzes] Thank you. The doctor wants to say goodbye. Doctor? Oh, yes, Rita. About the baby... ...you're both fine. - Oh, good. - Real fine. Thank you. Please sit down. Sit down. [instrumental music] With everything happening around here I haven't had a chance to tell you how sorry I am about Jerry. Thank you, doctor. I'll write to you. Let you know about the baby. Do you have a place to go? Not really. They just gave everyone orders to leave. Of course, there isn't really very much to stay for, is there? - Well... - Goodbye, doctor. I really have to go. The bus is waiting. - Let me walk you to the door. - I'll see myself out. - Goodbye. - Good luck. Thank you. [music continues] (male #8) Only one suitcase to a person, please. Move it along. Not since the 30s, when families by the thousands fled the Oklahoma Dust Bowl has a thriving American community had to be totally evacuated. Not even flood, fire, or hurricane have turned a whole section of a state into a no man's land, until today. (male #8) ...with a number you've been issued. [indistinct chatter] - Slow down. - That's it. Move right along. On the stairs, please! Move forward. (male #9) Take your time now, just take your time. Eddie, have you seen Ms. Schuster? No, sir. (male #10) Continue on up to the stairs. Uh, Hal, have you seen Ms. Schuster? No, sir, I haven't. [indistinct chatter] You boys lose somethin'? Maureen, you never did have a good concept of time. And remember, even on our first date we didn't get a chance to see the whole double feature. I was so afraid you wouldn't want to get this straight. Well, here I am. Shall we go? - Yeah. - Let go. I had a hold first. Now, look, Felix, I was carrying her books long before you showed up in Marysville. Now, you let go! Now, Clarence, Felix, y'all promised me there'd be no more fussing between you. And this surely isn't the time for it. Let go. (male #11) Alright, just follow the line. Yeah, follow the line. [indistinct chatter] [bus horn blaring] [whistle blows] [bus horn blaring] (Anne) Everything that they hold dear because of killer bees. Imagine having such a natural phenomenon to do something to a... Take this. Give me a hand with her. - Get her in the car. - Ah. Is the hospital here operating? - Yeah. - Right over this way... (Rita) Thank you. (male #12) Right over here... - You alright? - Yes, its better now. - We'll get you there. - Thank you very much. (Anne) Hold on. [engine starts] (Rita) Oh, hurry. [siren wailing] You enter the car with the number you've been issued. That car's number is five! Five! Let's get this train the hell out of here. Those damn bees could be back any minute. - Yeah, you. - Where the devil is Crane? Don't worry, sir he'll be here in time to take credit for the evacuation. Let me tell you something, Major. I don't tolerate my staff saying things behind a man's back. If you think Crane's a glory jockey tell him, not me. But if you're trying to butter me up by slurring a man I consider dangerously misguided I don't need a pat in the ass from you or anybody else. Yes, sir. [instrumental music] [music continues] Am I walking too fast for you? No, I'm fine. Just fine. Don't overdo it. Dr. Martinez said you had a close call. How sad. How very, very sad. You know, Marysville was such a happy little town. [sighs] Ritz's Bookstore. I used to work there when I was in high school. Everything was happy then. But that was so long ago. Shh. Hey. [train horn blaring] [indistinct chatter] You know, you can tell a lot about a man by the way he shuffles cards. Thank you, Clarence. It wasn't meant to be a compliment, Felix. Maureen, would you like to cut the cards? Something bothering you? What's wrong, Maureen? I've got a sudden feeling I'll never see Marysville again... ...or any of my children. It's frightenin'. Well, now, Maureen, that isn't like you. You're always the optimist. Always looking at the bright side of things. Sure, we'll be home soon and this will all seem like a bad dream to you. That's right. Well, I suppose that's so. But I can't shake this feeling that something's closing in on all of us. Now, now, Maureen. Uh, come on, deal, Felix. - Sandwiches? - Uh, no, thanks. (Felix) No, thank you. [train horn blaring] [bees buzzing] - Ed? - Yeah? There's a bee in here. A bee? - Don't take any chances. - Maybe he wants the apple. (Ed) Well, then give it to him. Hey! Goddamn! What will I do now? Don't move. Don't get him mad! [screams] No, Charlie! [screaming] [dramatic music] [woman screaming] [people screaming] [screaming continues] [screaming] [explosion] For God sake, Crane, when are we gonna stop this massacre? Our first airdrop is scheduled in half an hour. And I've seen what you are planning to drop. Those damn poison pellets of yours won't get us anywhere. Excuse me, General, those are my damn poison pellets and I think they'll work. And I'm counting on them working, General. Or we fall back to almost impossible odds. My coming up with a mass antidote which might never be perfected. Thank you, gentlemen, for your support. But, uh, Captain...feed this into the computer. African bees attack a train... ...seventy miles northwest of Houston. Now, give me a revised time fix, please. General, I know how you feel. Especially because of what just happened. But right now we are ready to drop millions of lethal pellets without harming either the population or the plant life. I'll support that. So will I. But what we need is every helicopter that you have. Alright, you've got them. Revised timetable coming through, sir. [instrumental music] [bees buzzing] [music continues] They're not touching the pellets! They're not touching the pellets! They seem to sense it's something that will kill them. They're brighter than we thought. They always are. Maybe you should have tried Bourbon and branch water and got them drunk. [thinking] It's all my fault. I threw firebombs at the swarm. [thinking] It's all my fault. I threw firebombs at the swarm. [instrumental music] You've got a beautiful six and a half pound beautiful daughter. [chuckles] Thank you. I guess it's true what they say... That a woman sort of falls in love with her doctor at this time. [chuckles] I hope you will feel the same way tomorrow. And the day after. And all of the days after. [instrumental music] [flatline] Paul! [dramatic music] Tomas! Tomas! [music continues] [music continues] [sobbing] Helena. Why this one? In the whole damn world, why this boy? My God, Brad, what good is all that science? All that equipment at the base? All those doctors? What good are you? [sobbing] I didn't mean that. You know I didn't. [sighs] Paul was my first case when I was the town doctor. He wanted to be an archaeologist. He would've been a terrific one. I'm sure of it. You didn't tell me that three of the four survivors at the base had died. Well, you had other problems. And you didn't tell me that there's a syndrome of relapse among the survivors...shortly after they've been stung. A fatal relapse. Some do recover. A small percentage. But some do. Some. Well, the odds are better than none. (Slater) Well, you dropped your poison pellets and the Africans spit at them. Now, they're moving towards Houston faster than expected. General, you should know the enemy is always expected to do the unexpected. - Yeah. - Dr. Crane. Oh, Major Baker. Let's hear your rundown. "Three steel mills, seven oil refineries "two beet sugar plants and a nuclear power center. "Plus 46 towns, not including Houston are now directly in the path of the Africans." We'll have to evacuate the towns and close the factories. Well, I can tell you right now, we're gonna have trouble with that nuclear power plant. No way they'll shut down voluntarily. Millions of people in the area need the energy. If we don't shut them down, the bees will. Well, I'll check with Washington and see if I can get an official directive. Brad, I know most of the key executives at that plant. I've fought them in court often enough on environmental issues. I'll fly in and try to jaw bone some sense into them. Might be a lot quicker than Washington. Okay. You got it. Thank you. Miss. More bad news? Everything we tried has failed. Our last hope is your mass antidote. How close are you, Walt? I've tried it on all these rabbits. It knocks hell out of them. These are the only two still alive. Think I'm on the right track but I need more time to experiment. If you can't perfect it, Walt... ...we might just as well pack it in right away and ship out to New Zealand. What we need is something that people can self-inject if they get stung by an African bee. And we need it right now. Alright, alright. I get the picture. First thing in the morning, I'll try it on a human being. Like who? We're trying to come up with volunteers. - Like me? - Forget it. Walter, it'll may be take two or three days to convince anybody how much we need human guinea pigs. Meanwhile, I am here and I am convinced. I'm not ready for you yet. When I am, I'll let you know. Okay. Oh, and, uh, Walter will you please start eating the food they serve here? It has been specially weighed and measured to ensure you get enough energy for the long hours that you work. What the hell does a man have to do to get a simple beer and a pizza around here? All a man has to do, Walter, is ask. [instrumental music] All my notes are right here, Brad, on the desk next to the recorder. They contain the exact instructions, and I mean exact on how to prepare the antidote that I have developed. Every experiment with its individual notes... ...and conclusions is documented in this text. I'm going to test the serum on myself. Why? Because you're just damn fool enough to make me try it on you. It's my antidote, so it'll be my risk. First, I'm going to inject myself with the same input of venom I'd receive from the stings of six toxic bees. That's double the amount that anybody has been able to take and survive. Then I'm gonna see if I'll still be able to use the self-injector with my serum or whether muscular stiffness will make it impossible. I'll dictate the rest of this to the other recorder. [dramatic music] [beeping] I'm all ready. Physiograph is recording, everything is laid out. [dramatic music] The weal is rising instantly. Now, from the moment of being stung, a frightened victim medically inexperienced, would need about 60 seconds to get the self-injector from pocket or purse pull up a sleeve, waste a few seconds hesitating because he was afraid of the needle, and finally put it in. I'm going to give myself the same 60 seconds. [clock ticking] Heartbeat rising rapidly. Heartbeat now 140. I've put the antidote on the table right in front of me. Fifty-five seconds since I administered the venom. I'm gonna start reaching for it. It won't move. My arm feels like it's-it's strapped to my side. [heavy breathing] [instrumental music] Heartbeat, 160. Close to outer limit. Dropping now. Good. Good! 140... 130... Going to normal. 120. Look, dropping now. Dr. Krim, what are you doing? You missed the tough part. [panting] How much of a dosage did you take? About six stings' worth. Dr. Krim. Respiration still high, but not abnormally so. Well, let's see now. I administered the antidote about sixty-six seconds after the venom was injected. The antidote works. My God it works. Dr. Krim. [beeping] Now here's something. The four physiological responses. They are swinging from normal to some really spooky levels. They don’t seem to want to stay down, do they? In fact, they're turning bad. All of them. Heart rate, rising again. Oh, 130. 140. 150. - Oh, my God. - Oh. Losing, losing respiration. First sign, respiratory arrest. [dramatic music] Oh! [flatline] Doctor. [instrumental music] [music continues] Walter. Oh, Walter. [sobbing] [crying] [instrumental music] There it is. I just don't understand your request. You will. You will. Have you any idea, doctor, the consequences if I ask Washington for permission to shut down? Less disastrous than not shutting down. Look at all this. Don't you realize we supply power over a 500-mile area and purify the drinking water of seven million people? Yes, sir, I do realize that, but I don't think you realize how critical this situation is. What's more, there's nothing here that could possibly attract those bees of yours. I wouldn't be so sure of that. The infrared rays could signal and act like a beacon. No, no, no, doctor. See this. Billions of dollars have been spent to make these nuclear plants safe. Fail-safe. The odds against anything going wrong are astronomical, doctor. I appreciate that, doctor, but let me ask you. In all your fail-safe techniques is there any provision against an attack by killer bees? [siren blaring] Andrews here. Come in, control. [blaring continues] Control, this is Andrews. What's happening? [blaring continues] [bees buzzing] [men groaning] Control, go to manual! The bees. Let's get the hell out of here! No, no, no! This way. [men groaning] [bees buzzing] [screaming] Aah! [siren blaring] [screaming] [explosion] Crane? Crane! I've been authorized by the president to close down your operation. From now on, the war against the Africans will be under military direction. The way it should've been from the first. - What's the ETA now? - General? I'll say this for you, Crane... ...you tried. In spite of what you might think... ...I kind of hoped you'd pull it off. Please arrange protective crating for the two oscilloscopes and personally fly with them to Houston. I'll see you there with the tapes and the rest of the equipment. I'll be there. I haven't surrendered yet, General. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] (Frank on radio) Estimating that more than 600,000 people have already been evacuated from Houston. Elsewhere, in the nation people stayed indoors or went to church. But mostly between their prayers they watched the weather. And there, there was good news for most of the country other than Texas. Temperatures continued plunging and cold air coming down with an Alaskan Front was keeping the Africans confined to the Texas area. This is Frank Blair reporting from... [radio turns off] Who would've thought the bees would become the first alien force...to invade America? [music continues] - Where are you going, sir? - Air Force Headquarters. - Go right ahead, sir. - Thank you. [music continues] [music continues] Now that you're here without the president's authority how can you possibly help? Well, the least I can do is try. [music continues] General. Hello, Crane. - Doctor. - General. I'm, uh, really glad you're here for the finale. Is there anything I can do to help? I'm not sure, but come with me. Very impressive. By tomorrow there'll be no more Africans. At least not in the Houston sector. Have you really found a way to stop them? I hope so. If we can do it here, we can do it anywhere. This is really a dress rehearsal, a set procedure for any future African challenges. This is Houston computerized. And this is Houston. You see, the bees have formed almost a complete circle. Billions of them. And that's what we've been waiting for. Waiting for what? The battle plan is to get them all into one area and then zap 'em! Take a look over here. Captain. Doctor. - Major. - Major. You planned your arrival perfectly. Here they come. [bees buzzing] Freeze it. - Prepare to use the neutracide. - Neutracide? That's right. General, if you use that nothing will grow out there for the next ten years. Why worry about shaving when somebody's about to cut your head off? Go! - General? - Crane. Leader One to all aircraft deliver your cargo on target...now! [aircraft droning] They're coming through. They have learned to live with it. I was afraid of this. They've become immune to any pesticide. [siren blaring] So.. The occupation of Houston has begun... ...and General Thaddeus Slater is your first officer in history to get his butt kicked by a mess of bugs. [sighs] You got any of that birdseed left? [siren blaring] As I said before...they're high in potassium, low in sodium. And as I said before, terrific. How long can they live in the city? If they get food and water... ...they might just decide to stay here forever. [siren blaring] The Defense Department in Washington, DC has just confirmed the tragic news. With the approval of the White House and as a matter of last resort, the city of Houston will suffer massive man-made burning before daybreak. This agonizing decision was reached in accord with all opinions from the armed forces and leading scientists involved in the overwhelming, but to date fruitless countermeasures being attempted to destroy the African killer bee which has virtually brought the southwest to a standstill. The burnout is scheduled to be handled by flamethrowers within a matter of minutes. Light them up! Move out! Move out! [instrumental music] [music continues] Burn them out! [music continues] [bees buzzing] Listen to them. They're still out there. Billions of them. It's as if it were their city. Even though Slater's been at it for 24 hours with every flamethrower and soldier he can get. When you talk about the bees, it sounds almost as if you admire them. I do. They never fail to astonish me. It's as though a broad range of contingencies... ...has been planned for by the Creator... ...and programmed into them... ...for an endless future. Making them...the true inheritors of the Earth. A world without people. Maybe the Creator was equally obliging toward us and programmed into us the ability to beat them. Well, I wish He'd give us a clue. Here. Let me. Hmm. Right there, that's lovely. This is better than eight hours' sleep. How would you know? You haven't had eight hours' sleep in weeks. Hm... Listen. Listen. - What is it? - The bees. Why are they making that sound? That's the hunger tone. It causes them to mass together as if by community they can destroy whatever their enemy. Cold, hunger, anything. I wonder...if there's another sound that's part of their ritual. That might cause them to... - Helena? Helena? - Ah... Helena, what's the matter? Darling? [siren wailing] [wailing continues] [man screaming] [tires screeching] [explosion] I don't know what else we can do. I'm very sorry. Please, God...let her live. Sir, can we really count on a scientist who prays? I wouldn't count on one who doesn't. - You can forget the dossier. - Yes, sir. [bees buzzing] Street Fighter to Topkick! Come in, Topkick, come in! Topkick, can you read me? You two, come here. I can't get through to the General! Too much interference! Damn bees! Listen, get back to headquarters. Tell General Slater we need more reinforcements now! Go! [breathing heavily] [scraping] [intense music] [scraping continues] [music continues] [screams] [dramatic music] [music continues] [glass shattering] [screams] [explosion] [music continues] [bees buzzing] [bees buzzing] You wonder, don't you? Houston on fire. Will history blame me or the bees? - My compliments, General. - On what for God's sake? On being able to maintain a long-term... ...historical perspective. Well, Crane, at this point there's no other viable perspective. - Our time is up. - Not quite, General. We're ready with a final experiment. Please don't give up. Okay. Thank you. [bees buzzing] (Crane) We'll do another half dozen of these and if we don't have any luck we'll get some sleep and start after lunch, okay? (Newman) Okay. (Crane) And now, what's this? We've not had this before. Look at this, doctor. Look. Something's coming. Here we go. - I think we've done it. - I don't believe this. Yes, we have. - General, we've done it. - What? Look, we've got a match. By God, we've got a match. You understand, General, we've discovered two identical sound patterns. No, I don't understand. What the hell has that to do with killing bees? What you are hearing now is the African bee's mating sound. But listen to this. This one was made by the sonic alarm system at the missile base not by the bees, but they sound exactly alike. It was the sonic alarm system at the missile base which drew them in. It was the similarity that confused them. But when it stopped, they left. I still don't understand. General, the sonic alarm system happens to be an exact duplicate of the duet between the queen bee and the young queen bee challenging her domain. But bees can't hear. That's right. They go by vibration. But to the other bees, the sonic alarm felt like the vibration of a ritual they had to attend. Then you're saying, our alarm system attracted the bees into the complex? That's right, and we'll use this very sound to pull them out of Houston. Okay, I'm convinced. [dramatic music] [screaming] Kill the bees! Don't hit the man! No! Get it up! [screaming] [music continues] [glass shattering] [screaming] [bees buzzing] [indistinct chatter] [screaming] [music continues] [bees buzzing] [man screaming] General? General! - What is hell is going on? - The bees have broken inside! Now what? - You two get going! - Not without Helena. We'll take care of her. Now get the hell out of here. Use that new weapon you've come up with. Go! Slater. Dodge Airfield. Code seven. Fast! [screaming] - General! - Get out! I'm going to get Helena, if I don't make it you know what has to be done! Okay. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] [bees buzzing] [screaming] Major! There's no time for that. Let's go, put this around you. Drop those. Drop those. [music continues] - Newman. - Go, Brad, go. Move out. [screaming] General? [groaning] [music continues] (man on radio) Dr. Crane, this is Dodge Field, air tower number two. We read General Slater's instructions loud and clear. We're prepared to assist in every possible way Please come in, Dr. Crane. Please come in. Do you read me? Do you read me? - Affirmative. - Very good. Load the choppers with the sound horns and spread the big oil slick over the gulf, acknowledge. - Roger. - Out. Let's go. To all air force tankers. Spread your oil over the Gulf of Mexico. Four minutes to flaming. [dramatic music] [helicopter whirring] - Ready when you are, doctor. - Fine. Dr. Crane, is this alright here? Yes, that's fine. ls there one on the other side? - Yes, sir. - Well, please hurry. Won't the noise of the helicopter drown out your sound? No, it's an entirely different sonic level. All set, sir. [music continues] [engine whirring] Rescue Five to Alpha One, come in, please. Ditch sound floats. Ditch sound floats. [sonic buzz] Rescue Five to Alpha Two, come in. [sonic buzz] Rescue Five to Alpha Three. [sonic buzz] Pilot, get us to the firing point as quickly as you can. Here they come. [bees buzzing] [bees buzzing] (man on radio) Operation Sonic Drop complete. All aircraft clear at target. Okay, thank you. Fire it now, fire now. Fire 1, fire 2, fire 3, fire 4, fire 5! [explosion] Did we finally beat them? Or is this just a temporary victory? I-I don't know. But we did gain time. If we use it wisely, and if we're lucky. The world might just survive.
