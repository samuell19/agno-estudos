[man on speakers] Introducing the next speaker, I do so with a feeling of personal affection. We love him for the enemies he has made. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Fritz Kuhn. [crowd cheering and applauding] [in English] [crowd laughing] [crowd booing] [yelling] [crowd chanting] You will not replace us! You will not replace us! [shouts] Our side was defending themselves to a large degree. I've no doubt about that. [man] Does this day feel like a win to you? It does feel like a win because we demonstrated our resolve. [ambulance siren] [Daryle] Everything falls apart from this day. [man with Daryle] Yeah. Everybody knows them now. Everybody's seen them now. And when they go home to their families and to their jobs and to their professions, everybody's going to say, "Why were you there?" You motherfuckers! You dance like this. -Fuck you! -You know, you-- Fuck you! [shouts and crashing] [interviewer] Go, go, go, go. [tires screeching] -[people clamoring] -[cameraman] We got multiple injuries! Possible fatalities. [man yelling] Why? [Richard] Little mayor Singer... Signer... How do you pronounce this little creep's name? [man] Jew. Jew! That's how you pronounce it. [laughs] [Richard] The idea that I would ever back down to such a little creep like Mayor Signer. We are never backing down. Now it's not gonna be over. It's not going to be. Never. [people cheering] The problem that everybody has, I don't care if you're on the left or on the right, truth is going to do what truth does. Lies have consequences and you will not escape those. You know the old saying, "Evil flourishes when good people do nothing." Regardless of whether or not a person has the right to say whatever they want to say, the fact of the matter is when they make it clear that they're fascists, you're supposed to do something about it to make sure that those particular rights are intact. Otherwise, you're doing nothing more than copping out because you're too cowardly to put up a fight. [Richard] Daryle the Barrel, as he's known, he weighs at least 400 pounds. He's this anti-fascist activist who's done all sorts of research and has dedicated his life to hating people, you know, basically. [Daryle] I don't have kids of my own. I have nieces and nephews. I hope that they are able to learn something from what it is that I do. I'm not begrudging Antifa of trying to remain anonymous and to remain inconspicuous in the work they do, but I can't do that and that's one of the reasons why. My family needs to know and the people around me need to know that this is what I am, this is what I do and I'm damn proud of it. And I want you to learn something from all of that. Have you ever met Antifa or interviewed them? What are they like? In defense of Daryle, he's not a strung-out, you know, gutter punk. Yeah. I don't think he's on drugs. He's just on donuts. [Richard laughs] [Richard] The idea that we just randomly have different skin color, but we're all the same, it's just absolutely ridiculous. Hail Trump. Hail our people. Hail victory. [people cheering] [Richard] Race matters, race has mattered for every single person in world history except silly white liberals and white conservatives post 1960. The idea that we're the strange ones is risible. [Daryle] There's a gentleman by the name of Richard Spencer, little rich kid, never had a real job except maybe being a tutor to some high school kids in a school somewhere. He's basically known as a right-wing propagandist and he's always had these hate politics coming along with him. Our identity is going to be forged through this great crisis that we're experiencing. We're experiencing the implications of mass immigration and multiculturalism and multiracialism. We're going to come out of it as a new people. [Daryle] If you're going to be about neo-fascist ideas, neo-fascist principles, goodbye, you're gone. When I was in the military, I took an oath to defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic. You become a domestic enemy when you do shit like that. [Gavin] So, what is this thing you guys are doing? [male interviewer] So, it's an independent documentary on alternative right ideology, thought. And you're actually the first... You're the first person we're filming with and this is literally the first day. -OK. -OK? [blowing] The alt-right is an abbreviation of "alternative right." The phrase was coined in 2008 by a very alt-right guy named Richard Spencer. He hooked up with a guy named Paul Gottfried who is a college professor of some small college somewhere who once gave a speech saying that we need an alternative right. Spencer turned that term, "alternative right," into the name of his new blog that he started writing. And to give you an idea of how bad that blog was, they once had an article suggesting that maybe we should start trying black genocide, killing off all black people. The idea basically of the alternative right in the U.S. is that the baby boomers sold them out, have created a completely untenable situation by encouraging non-white immigration, interracial relationships and so on. In many ways, the alternative right is just really a branding, a rebranding of white supremacy for public relations purposes. [Gavin] There's the alt-right. They all get put under this umbrella of alt-right. And then there's a sliver here of total and utter nuts. You have the alt-lite that is totally fine with gays and wants legalization of drugs and is basically libertarian politically. So, Milo Yiannopoulos. You've got me, you've got Ann Coulter. Now the alt-right, you have a lot more conservative values, a lot more pro-white sentiment that says, like Richard Spencer said, very intelligent guy, I love debating him, but he said to me, "There's no future for non-whites in America." America was, until this past generation, a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity. [crowd cheering] [Daryle] That little stuff made Richard Spencer well-known in the mainstream as a white supremacist because, when people started sieg-heiling and he started screaming "Hail victory," which, by the way, is the English translation of "Sieg Heil," that particular conference and that particular stunt threw it all through the doors wide open as to what the so-called alt-right truly was. But we already knew who they were. It wasn't really a secret. The truth is that we are being ethnically cleansed in our own nation, in the nation our own forefathers built. This is what I know from this meeting, I'd like for you to repeat it if you believe it. The goyim know! -[people] The goyim know! -Yeah! Hey, everyone, listen up! Listen up! Everyone, everyone, listen up! You need to get together, turn around and move towards your vehicles, get in them and move now! We have violent Antifa on the way right now! We are going to be aggressive, we are gonna be confrontational and our way of doing that is basically just exposing the hate mongers in ways that they don't want to be exposed. -Get out of my face! -What's wrong, man? Get out of my face! Get out of my face! -You did! -[woman] We'd love to have-- [Daryle] You know how racist they are! You know how hateful they are! -No pictures. -[Daryle] Too late. And don't touch that. Don't start anything like that. Don't start anything with me, boy. -[Daryle] Boy? Boy? -[woman] Who is that? [Daryle] My organization is called One People's Project. And what we do is that we report and research and provide information about neo-Nazi groups and other assorted hate groups around the country. One of the biggest fears is that they will be revealed, they will be doxxed, they will be found out and people would know who they are because that means they'll lose their job, they'll lose their standing in society. That crowd is more afraid of us than we are of them. [interviewer] What happens if you are doxxed? I'm probably fucked. [Rachel] Daryle Lamont Jenkins has made it a personal crusade to monitor and expose and, honestly, to annoy white supremacists all over the country. -You take a lot of pleasure in your work. -Oh, yes, indeed. [Richard] He's pretty gross-looking, to be honest. I personally like to be around people who are good-looking. [Daryle] You knew I was coming. I didn't know you were coming. I thought you might be dead by now-- -No, no, no. That was your dream. -Because of your obesity. [Daryle] Yeah. Unfortunate-- If you're whittled down to fat jokes, baby, then you're just done. [Daryle] First time I heard of Dick Spencer was in 2011. I mean, I sat in on the press conference that they was having. I asked a question. We were all good. It deteriorated from there because he's still a Nazi. And I had to treat him like one. What do you think is gonna happen to the alt-right? I already know what's going to happen. -We've been here before. -Are we going to fall? -Oh, really? -Yes, you are gonna-- It's going to be like '45? [Jared] Daryle Lamont Jenkins is a black activist whose job it is to try to silence people like me. People littered my neighborhood with my name and address and said, you know, in effect to go punch this guy out because of what he thinks. That kind of behavior can get a pass in our society today because the zeitgeist is still in their favor. For the country to tolerate that, to me, is a sign of just how corrupt we've become. [Mark] The idea that there's a substantial radical left in the U.S. is ridiculous. The claim that there are somehow some sort of equivalency that, you know, you've got this large radical right and then equally large and equally scary radical left is simply not true. And I'm not denying historical realities. Look, I mean in the 1960s, early '70s, there was a whole lot of left-wing real-life terrorism. But that's simply not true anymore. [Lacy] Some members of the alt-right, their literature says that women should be feminine and polite. Those are their two adjectives, feminine and polite. Guess what, I'm not going to go back into the kitchen, I'm not going to be barefoot and pregnant, I am not going to let them rollback my rights. I'm not going back. And I will fight them with my last breath. [TV KWA] I think there are a lot of young people who, through whatever circumstances came to be really disillusioned with the social environment they grew up in and see this as some kind of reactionary response that kind of appeals to them. [Richard] With a lot of these young kids, they haven't read the book, they've watched a YouTube video that's given it all to them. And I'm not-- I don't say that to dismiss them because it's almost like some of us were smoking, you know, weed for years and tried a little cocaine and some of these young kids just like injected heroin into their eyeball. But they've come to these ideas much more quickly and in a much more intense fashion. [TV KWA] I was attracted to a lot of the arguments they were making, as far as advocating for white people, advocating for your own self-interest when everybody else is doing the same thing, it's kind of sink or swim scenario. [Simran] I don't think that the alt-right would exist in the way that it does today without a medium like the Internet. People can do it anonymously and without consequence and then actually be, "rewarded for doing so." You know, it's an incentivized system that just creates more and more hate. [Daryle] There's a lot of hate that's out there in today's society. People who have just been involved in this kind of hate politics, they're just getting beaten down at every single turn, and along comes a guy like Donald Trump who gives them a little bit of juice. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. [crowd cheering] So much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. [crowd cheering] [Jared] Donald Trump did appeal to a certain incipient racial consciousness among the electorate. A certain number of people, an unknown number of people voted for him because he wanted to build a wall, he wanted to throw out all illegals and he wanted to take a very, very hard look at Muslim immigration. Those people are incipiently racially conscious because all of those policies, they will slow the dispossession of whites, they will slow the reduction of whites to a minority. This is an important appeal to a certain number of Americans. I don't know how many. My friend Alonzo Bodden has a very funny quote, he's a comedian. He goes, "Not all Trump supporters are racists, but all racists are Trump supporters." [man] Right, right, right. [Mark] I think it's almost impossible to say what the next three and a half years of Trump are going to play out like. Assuming that Trump is not impeached or doesn't wind up in prison, you know, I think that things are going to get worse. For these four years, white nationalists really feel like they have their man in the White House and that maybe they will be able to make real progress in terms of, uh, cracking down on non-white immigration, that kind of thing. [crowd cheering] [Richard] The inauguration was actually quite civilized. There was heavy police presence. Everyone was well behaved. Fuck that! Fuck-- There was a-- An Australian broadcast company came over. So there was a big circle around. And I was doing my usual stuff. So I was engaging in some banter-- [reporter] Are you like a hipster version of the neo-Nazi movement? What? It's a-- It's a kind of a symbol-- [man 1] Fuck you! -[people yelling] -[man 2] Hey! [cameraman] Yo, brother, let me see your face! -Fuck you, man. -What's your name? -Fuck you, man! -You're a fucking criminal! -Get the fuck away from me! -You're a criminal! I can punch Richard Spencer right in the face. [Richard] Just inside of my head, so I can't hear out of this ear too well right now. [interviewer] Do you feel safe? Um, I ultimately feel safe, but I would say this, uh, and I almost regret saying this because I know it will give my enemies some joy, but I would say that two years ago I would feel utterly safe and I wouldn't-- I felt that I could be anonymous. We've entered a new stage where political violence has returned. [interviewer] Do you know who punched him? Can you give me any info about it? Because nobody-- -I cannot give you any information. -[interviewer] Nobody knows anything. [Mark] What the Antifas, the anti-fascists, are doing by and large is really wrong. Uh, it is really a mistake. It may feel great for some guy with a black mask on to run up and punch Richard Spencer on the side of the face, but it does not help, uh, progressive causes in this country. In fact, it does just the opposite. I think that he doesn't have any moral authority to actually say, "Gee, whiz, I shouldn't get a sucker punch in the face." I think Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, said that. [interviewer] What did he say? That the only really truly effective thing in any movement is violence. And it's hard to argue that. If they want to shut down Antifa, they should be violent. I cannot recommend violence enough. It is a really effective way to solve problems. If you really believe that the white majority in this country is under threat in some way, any act of violence is just going to make things worse for white people. We don't believe in absolute non-violence. Our understanding is that one can engage in violence when all other means fail. My thing has always been, if you're going to engage in violence, basically, it has to be as a form of defense. But, like I said, when you see folks on the other side taking swipes at us, naturally folks are swiping back. As far as I'm concerned, you picked this fight, now fight. [Trump] Knock the crap out him, would you? Seriously. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise. [yelling] [TV hostess] Developing news. Anger boiling over. Our cameras are rolling as fights break out between anti-Trump protesters and the President's supporters. [yelling] [Daryle] Just trying to learn more. I'm just seeing it for the first time now. So, this rally was especially important for a lot of the Trump supporters because this was supposed to be the day where they would just show Antifa what's up. Unfortunately, it looks like Antifa showed them. The silent majority does support Trump. Because I voted for him and I support him and he's doing exactly what we asked him to do and that's exactly why he's the greatest president. -[interviewer] Have you been happy so far? -Completely happy. Every reason for everything he's doing right now is every reason why I voted for him. [Daryle] The Trump supporters, they keep talking about how they're fed up with the way their society is going and they want their country back. Uh-uh. You fed up? You don't know fed up. We know fed up. And... that's why we're going to win. [Mark] The Southern Poverty Law Center is not a law enforcement organization. So, if SPL staffers run across a real-life criminal plot, you know, they don't play games, right? They go straight to the FBI or the local police force, whoever it is. Part of this work is that people want to kill you or at least they say they do. So, we've had a lot of threats over the years. You know, I've had to surround the house with cameras, you know, television system and closed circuit TV system that completely encircles our house. Certainly, over the years, we've gotten mail from the Klan here. At one point, we had a threat from the Aryan Brotherhood, uh, and my bosses insisted that we move out of the house for a week. You know, at one point, I was notified last year by a letter from a federal court in New York State that a certain guy had bought a machine gun and part of the plan was to kill me among others. [interviewer] Do you know who Mark Potok is? -[Richard] Yeah. -What are your thoughts on him? He's obviously a terrible human being. Um, and, you know, he clearly wants to shut down free speech. And, if given the power and if given the opportunity, I am positive that he would want to arrest people like me for selling distrust in the communities or some, you know, Orwellian phrase like that. [Mark] Richard Spencer is a guy, sad to say, that came out of the real academic world, he actually got a master's at University of Chicago, who in 2011 took over a small little-known outfit called the National Policy Institute and turned it into something more than it had been. [Richard] Who are we? We aren't just white. White is a checkbox on the census form. We are part of the people's history, spirit and civilization of Europe. [Mark] Spencer was able to get a fair following by presenting himself as the kind of well-dressed suit-and-tie version of the Klan. The SPLC is a hate group effectively because they spend much of their time hating people. The hate list is basically a list of people it hates. If you're not on that list, it does mean you're a cock. But, definitely, if you're not, you're not cool. [Daryle] Spencer wants the attention. Spencer adores the attention. That's the biggest downfall to any Nazi. Because, if he is considered to be a household name, what can you do with that? How do you grow with that? Answer? You don't. This is an old Klan hood that I got from someone. Whenever they get out of the WP scene, they tend to want to get rid of all the things that were a part of it. H is the eighth letter of the alphabet. HH, Heil Hitler. That same person also gave me all of his literature. These are two bags of that. They have comic books, racist comic books. There's also newsletters. I go after a group called the National Socialist Movement. They even have cookbooks. [chuckles] And, uh... this crap. [laughs] But that's it, that's what I got. That's what I brought here today. [Daryle] They want an ethnostate. They want a white ethnostate. They want us to be separated by race. And that's what they're pushing for. So, if you're ever hearing about any nonsense about being patriotic coming from this crowd, that's crap. The truth of the matter is that's a fascist state. I'm Antifa. I don't let fascist state grow. [interviewer] Tell me about this idea you have of a white ethnostate... Mmm-hmm. ...within the U.S. and how you see that working. Well... I don't think it would take place within the U.S. Um, the ethnostate and, as I conceive it, is a post-American possibility. And it would happen after a dramatic paradigm change after which America, U.S. as we know it, would lose legitimacy, would no longer be possible and we would have to need something new. So, it is a kind of post-revolutionary idea. And it would ultimately be a safe haven for all whites around the world. Whether you're Russian or Irish or Italian or Norwegian, this would be a safe place for you. So, it would have a kind of Zionist component to it. It would be like Israel is a safe haven for world Jewry. And that would be the ethnostate. There are literally tens and tens and tens of millions of people who are not white, who are not Christian, and who were born in this country and whose parents and grandparents were born in this country. Do you think they're gonna leave because Richard Spencer would like them to? You know, the ideology is a prescription for mass murder. [narrator] The partition in August 1947 saw the British Indian empire split in two, mostly along religious lines. Pakistan was intended to be the Muslim homeland. India, intended for Hindus and Sikhs. It was a recipe for trouble. [man] Partition triggered one of the largest migrations in human history. Muslims trekked to West and East Pakistan, later Bangladesh. Millions of Hindus went the other way. A hastily drawn border cut families, farms and communities in two. Between one and two million people died in the process. It would be just a total renewal of whites as a people. We'd no longer be these just, you know, silly fat goofballs and dockers going off to our graves. [interviewer] Now, would gays be allowed in this society? Yes. Uh, yeah. I mean, it would be for whites, and... Look, I don't know the origins of homosexuality. I think there might be a genetic component. I've read literature on a physical, but non-genetic component, uh, that it's something that occurs in the womb actually. Um, there's also been-- There's a germ theory and so on. There is gonna be a portion of the population that's going to be gay. And I think we should just live with that and it's OK. We don't want to focus our energies on converting homosexuals. I wasn't here a few days before I was getting harassing letters and bad looks or people knocking on my door or things like that. I mean it gets a bit annoying, to be honest. And it is kind of funny that I provoke them so much. OK. I've answered this question, "Are you a white supremacist?" so many times that I'm kind of sick of it and I'm tempted to almost say, "Yes." I'm Satan to them, but, you know, people are ultimately fascinated by Satan. I'm not sure anyone is able to read that except me. Maybe that's a good thing. [chuckles] There is no doubt that the alt-right has been attractive to angst-ridden young men. And I think that's interesting because it's ultimately frustrated and ambitious young men who change the world. I'm going to fix a bourbon. I don't want my reputation to suffer. OK, let's do it. America is going to have to fragment for this new ideology to emerge. And that's what's happening. All right, so this is a "I'm pissed off" video, so... [grunting] Go Alex Jones, just take my shirt off. All right. Well, I sometimes wonder if I am living in a time warp and whether we're just repeating past mistakes, having learned nothing. [interviewer] Are they a fad like some people have posed or are they a real threat? I don't think that there's any question at all that we are seeing a real rise of this kind of ethnoracial nationalism in the U.S., and in fact, in much of the Western world in general. You know, I think this is a massive historical kind of trend and it's going to get worse before it gets better. [interviewer] Should we even talk about the alt-right or would that be giving them a platform? There's a kind of struggle that I would characterize as the kind of policy of quarantine versus the policy of inoculation. Back in the 1950s, when groups like the American Nazi Party were beginning to pop up, a number of Jewish agencies and other groups got together and approached newspaper publishers, people who ran television stations and said, "Look, don't cover the American Nazi Party. If you give attention to them, it will just help them build up and get more members and so on." Well, it was somewhat useful for a while, that policy, quarantine. It was actually called the quarantine policy. Today, I think obviously that's totally impossible as a practical matter. There are so many venues out there from cable to social media to talk radio, of course, to all kinds of, you know, zines and so on that it is virtually now impossible to suppress information. So, what do you do? You just stand back and pretend it doesn't exist or keep your mouth shut and hope nobody's listening? I think not. You know? I think that the answer is to take on the claims of these groups and the radical right in general directly. Hello, I'm Jared Taylor with American Renaissance. The mainstream media are now full of stories explaining the alt-right. Even a Japanese newspaper interviewed me the other day about the "alto-righto." As a long-standing member of the alt-right, this is how I see it. We are a broad dissident movement that includes many different websites, organizations and viewpoints. But they all agree on one thing, equality is a dangerous myth. [Mark] Jared Taylor has published for a long time now a journal called American Renaissance. And this is fundamentally a white nationalist journal, but one which does not engage in the use of slurs and so on. This is my latest book, yes. So, you're welcome to have a copy. [Daryle] Jared Taylor is considered now to be the godfather of the alternative right. East Asians are, on average, maybe three or four IQ points above whites. And these are just differences we have to deal with. And to pretend they're not there is just like pretending that, uh, I don't know, that males and females are absolutely identical. They're just not the same. Jared Taylor and a number of other white supremacists set up this hierarchy, where he said, "Well, Asians are even smarter than we white people, so we can't be racist because we recognize, boy, they're really good at math compared to us. But, of course, we are vastly smarter and better people genetically than black people, than brown people," and so on. The idea that you can identify, you know, entire groups of people based on their IQ is absurd. First, how do you divide between "black people and white people"? Right? I mean if you have one black ancestor and 20,000 white ones, does that make you black? What about if it's the reverse? [Jared] You can study these phenomena and there are group differences. But, as Adlai Stevenson liked to say, "Given a choice between agreeable fantasy and disagreeable fact, Americans will go for the fantasy every time." [Mark] The idea that you could figure out who was good racial stock and who was not good racial stock based on measurements of your skull. The science was absolutely not science at all. It was ridiculous. None of those things were true. What's wrong with eugenics? Which is basically the idea that we can breed better human beings by not allowing certain people to procreate. Well, Nazi Germany eugenics ended with the murder of tens of thousands of children who were mentally ill or mentally retarded or had some physical handicap. It is this idea that there are better people and worse people and that is determined by genes. So, if only we can stop the people with worse genes and, of course, once upon a time, that included black people, gay people, brown people, yellow people, and so on, then we will make a better world. [male narrator] War is not a pretty thing at best, but no words can express the world's disgust at Germany's organized carnage. Behind its high walls, their victims, Poles, Greeks, Russians, any non-Germans, were systematically slaughtered. [Mark] It's worth pointing out that the eugenics movement was in many ways born in the U.S. The sad fact is that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis looked to the U.S. when they were getting interested in eugenics, when they were getting interested in race laws, when they were getting interested in laws against miscegenation, so-called race mixing. Ultimately, the U.S. turned against this idea. Eugenics and the ideas behind eugenics have been absolutely and utterly discredited uh, by virtually all scientists, absent an incredibly tiny fringe of people on the extreme right. Now that I am considered, oh... a dangerous figure, I suppose, it's difficult to persuade mainstream publishers to publish my books. I used to get the mainstream to do this. White people, certainly white southerners, are the only group in this country who are not allowed to take pride in who they are. You can be black, Hispanic, Asian, Indian, African, anything at all, you can be proud of who you are. Not white people. [singing] So, this is back when I was still respectable writing about Japan. [Mark] He's written a number of books, speaks fluent Japanese, is a world traveler, plays an instrument in a classical chamber orchestra and so on, but he is also the guy who, for the last 20 years, arguably has done more than any other to mainstream white nationalism. [interviewer] So, they consider you a hatemonger. Hmm, yes, I'm a hater. They can look into my soul. They know what motivates me. Don't even talk to him because we know. And they say, "Because we know, we have designated him a hate group." And so every time the liberal media talks to someone like me, they say, "And, by the way, this objective rating agency, as if there's sort of a Standard & Poor of the ideological spectrum, they have put him on the hate list." No, this is just absurd. The goal is not simply being angry. The goal is to change the minds of our fellow whites and create an environment in which our culture will survive. [Daryle] Back in January of last year, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. And that hit me for a loop. It was just a blow because I knew that my life was about to change. And life is at that point where it's going to start taking things away from you. Well, I never really looked at the directions that I was going in personally, I was only concerned with the profession, I was only concerned with going out there trying to help others and trying to, um, make everyone else's life better. And then, I look back and said, "Wait, what about mine? What about me? What do I want?" And I really only started asking those questions last year, when I got the diagnosis. Last year, 2016, was a nice a little yin and yang because I had the cancer on one end, but I was also working on the television show on the other. I was showing up on Rachel Maddow. I was showing up on Joy Reid. People on my side started to know me as opposed to just folks on the right, because I was notorious on the right for a good 16 years at this point, but no one on the left, no one in the mainstream knew who I was. When that cancer hit, I said that has to change. That has to change because I'm not gonna just have my legacy defined by neo-Nazis. I think I focused a lot more on the relationships of the people around me. I'm closer to my family. It's not like we haven't been close before, but I really wanted to, uh, make sure that they understood. See, one of the things that my family was never really a part of was my work. Two weeks from now, dinner at stage house and shelter. I will be there. -Um, as it is, I hear-- -We need to call your friends. I hear I'm going to go see Thor. [Daryle] I was just basically trying to protect them. But now is the case of "You got to know who I am. You got to know what I've been doing out there." My only regret, and it's a big one, is my father passed on before he understood. He passed on in 2011. He never knew really what I was doing out there. He was the strongest man in the world as far as I was concerned. He taught me how to fight. He taught me how to teach, how to educate. He did participate in the sit-ins while he was a student at Benedict College in South Carolina. My father's from Newark, New Jersey. And aggressive physical contact from our brothers in Newark, New Jersey, doesn't go over well. If you're gonna fight somebody, you're gonna fight. He was doing sit-ins, and that non-violent thing was only to a point. And they're getting yelled at, they are screamed at, they are being called names. One guy decided he was going to squeeze mustard on everybody's head and just went on down the line. He got to my father, and learned the hard way just what it felt like to get thrown through a plate-glass window behind him. Father almost got expelled for that one. But that's about as much activism that I think my father's done. I think that was pretty significant though. [interviewer] In what way did your childhood influence your worldview? [stuttering] We are a product of--of our upbringing at some level. That said, I don't think it really affected me directly. Um, my parents are not alt-right in the sense... Country Club Republican is a term that probably fits them pretty well, even though they're not members of Country Club. I think a lot of people want to believe that anyone who thinks race is real and race is something worth fighting for, if you believe that, you must have been inculcated, indoctrinated when you're a kid and so on. Probably nothing could be further from the truth. My childhood was, I would say, pretty idyllic. I mean, it was in the burbs. If you just looked at my life from that standpoint, you'd say, "Oh, what is Richard going to become?" You would probably say he was going to become a banker or a lawyer, a doctor, an architect or something like that. I don't think you would have said, you know, "Vanguard intellectual, banned in multiple European countries, denounced by Hillary Clinton." I don't think you would say that. [man] We're just gonna sit there in the vehicle and we're going to call Metro and be, like, "Hey, these fucking commies are over here obstructing traffic. And we're like not anywhere near protesting or anything and we're just in the vehicle and we just want to go home, come deal with these fucking degenerates." That's that plan. [interviewer] Why do we hate? Well, because, uh... We want things for ourselves that other people seem to have. [man talking indistinctly over bullhorn] [Mark] Or, you know, another big piece of it is, "I feel guilty about a certain way I am as a person and I wind up needing to blame someone else." Right? To externalize that. Eric Hoffer is an academic who wrote a very important book. The fundamental idea of Hoffer is that true believer, the person who becomes a fanatic, whether on the right or the left, uh, is the person who feels that his or her own life is so meaningless that it has no weight in the universe. They're embarrassed about themselves, they feel guilty about how small and worthless and meaningless their lives are, and the only way they can feel themselves bigger or to have a place in the world is to attach themselves sort of fanatically uh, to a certain kind of extreme idea. [crowd chanting] Antifascista! A... Anti... Antifascista! A... Anti... Antifascista! A... Anti... Antifascista! A... Anti... Antifascista! [yelling] My name is Milo Yiannopoulos and I'm the gay technology editor of Breitbart News. I was due this evening to speak at UC Berkeley about cultural appropriation. [man 1] Here we go. Someone has moved in closer. [man 2] Somebody's taking a selfie. [Daryle] When Milo Yiannopoulos was at Berkeley a few weeks ago, Antifa blew the place up. [Milo] It turns out that the progressive left, the social justice left, the feminist, Black Lives Matter, Antifa left, the hard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech-- Fuck you! How fucking dare you call me white supremacist? [crowd cheering] [Mark] Most of the activists of the alternative right are making a real effort to kind of invade American campuses and they've been very successful at creating a situation where they pose, they present themselves as the defenders of free speech. And it is the evil forces of left-wing, "cultural Marxism," that are attacking them on campus and other speaking venues and not allowing them to speak. [people protesting] [crowd] We don't want no fascists here! [Gavin] When you shut down the conversation, lies can thrive and make babies and start entire communities. -[people clamoring] -[whistle blowing] These kids wouldn't stop yelling, "Whose campus? Our campus." So I go, "Come up here, talk to me. Let you say your side." The closer I got to him, the more he went, "Uh-uh." And he'd go, "Whose campus--" There's no substance to this beef, it's just beef for beef's sake, it's fashion. I mean it's kind of a catch-22 because free speech and all. The First Amendment is a great thing, but, you know, people are inciting genocide and nationalistic xenophobic tendencies. I mean, we are going down a rabbit hole. It sounds a lot like 1930s Germany right now. [Mark] First Amendment is an incredibly strong protector of speech in this country. Literally, there's no country in the world that has such strong speech protections as this country. So, the truth is that, under the First Amendment, uh, a neo-Nazi could stand in Radio City Music Hall and tell 20,000 people, "We need to kill the Jews and we need to kill them now." That is considered, by the courts, to be simply advocacy of a position. I'm just sitting in a hotel room stunned that hundreds of people were throwing rocks because they're so threatened by the idea that a conservative speaker might be persuasive and interesting and funny and might, you know, might take some people with him. Um, they just have to shut it down at all costs. America, of all places, now is a scene of political violence in response to ideas. It's very shocking. [TV KWA] This is my Patreon account. Like, I work full-time and go to school at night, so I don't really have a lot of time to do this in the first place. So I figured, like, it would be interesting to see if any of the fans of the stuff that I do were willing to, like, support that through monetary donations. I received some kind of e-mail notice telling me that my page had been removed. They said that there's no room on Patreon for hate speech, no matter the purpose or apparent intention of the Patreon page. This includes actions that take place on other site. [interviewer] What do you consider to be a hate speech? [TV KWA] I think hate speech is entirely a social construct to get sucked into that debate, in the first place, is to lose it. And I think that that term is weaponized from its very moment of creation. [Jared] I think there's no such thing as hate speech. How would you define hate speech? If I got up and said, "I hate Puerto Ricans" or "I hate my neighbor," I mean, should that be illegal? Why is it illegal to hate someone? There is no limits to free speech. This is something young people have a lot of trouble understanding. They go, "Free speech doesn't include hate speech." And you go, "What does it include then? The Rolling Stones are better than the Beatles? What is free speech?" There is no situation in America where words come out of your mouth and you belong in prison. None. Hate speech is protected under the First Amendment, but that doesn't mean it's protected by ethics. It just simply means that they don't go to jail for it. But, if what you say does cause some sort of harm, people are going to have to respond. Those who say it's just expression, it's just speech, it doesn't actually mean anything, what we see frequently is that these ideas become ingrain within people's consciousness and then they get translated into real physical violence. [Daryle] So, this is in our possession right now. It's the Keystone State, "skinheads, from back in 2003." But what made this video so significant is that there's a band on this video called Youngland. The guy that's playing bass for Youngland, his name is Wade Page. Wade Page, about a decade or so later, walked into a... Sikh temple, just aside Green Bay, I think it's in Oak Park, Wisconsin, and, um, shot and killed a number of parishioners at this temple. It was the largest mass murder at a place of worship uh, in about 50 years on American soil. [Mark] This came in the middle of a lot of anti-Muslim rhetoric in this country, coming both from officials and anti-Muslim hate groups and so on. And Page probably felt that, somehow, this is something that people would approve of or at least some people would approve of. [Simran] Sikhs are often seen as Muslims. The way that I've been treated and even just perceived in this country has changed for the worse over the last year. OK, so, I'm looking at a website called the Vanguard News Network. It's one of the most popular ones and its administrator, Alex Linder, had written a reaction that became very widely shared among white supremacist immediately after the Wisconsin shooting. He says, "Take your dead and go back to India and dump their ashes in the Ganges, Sikhs. You don't belong here in the country my ancestors fought to found and deeded to me and mine, their posterity. Even if you come here legally and even if you haven't done anything wrong personally, go home, Sikhs. Go home to India, where you belong. This is not your country. It belongs to white men." Now, if you have a xenophobic, misogynistic, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric, then you will certainly see rises in hate incidents because people then feel emboldened, right? If people are now saying-- If our leaders are saying that these people are second-class citizens, then Americans will start treating them like second-class citizens. A jury wasting little time to convict Dylann Roof for the massacre inside a historic black church in South Carolina. The self-radicalized white supremacist stood trial in a federal court for gunning down nine black parishioners. Dylann Roof, the author of the Charleston massacre, is a classic example of a guy who came into the movement, was radicalized and ultimately committed mass murder based solely, 100%, on what he read on the Internet. Right before he started to kill people, he said, you know, "You people are raping our women and taking over." Well, you know, that is the precise narrative of the Council of Conservative Citizens and the larger radical right. So, you know, it's a remarkable case because Roof really had no interaction with anybody. It was just information on the Internet. And we're seeing more and more of that, where people are radicalized simply by what they're reading on the Internet. [Richard] Some of the things he claimed to care about you know, Southern heritage or something like that, he was radically counterproductive. I mean, the Dylann Roof incident directly led to the removal of the Confederate flag from public places, from the Confederate flag becoming much more taboo. It's just a very sad case. And I'm sure it won't be the last. I mean, I'm sure there will be other cases of someone like this who latches on to an alt-right idea, that might be true in itself, but then he engages in an appalling act. [interviewer] Are you concerned about the idea of domestic terrorists in the future being linked to some of your writing, some of your-- If something like that happens, I'm just going to get out in front of it and just be like, "Look, yeah. This guy mentioned he read a blog of mine or a blog of someone in the alt-right. What does that mean?" You know. I mean, there are people who-- [interviewer] What does it mean? I think it means something in a sense that the alt-right is getting at that fissure, you know. It's getting at those really taboo issues, it's getting at that real-- at the most difficult aspects of society. And so that might attract people who are ill in some way. So, it means that, but it doesn't mean anything other than that. I mean, it's just not... It's not relevant. I feel very strongly that we should not ban sites and discourse like this. Right? This is free speech, there is no imminent threat. So, it's protected. I think that's important. But what I think is also important is that we need to be aware of what people like Alex Linder and other white supremacist leaders are saying because that has a direct bearing on how we can respond to them. If we don't even know what their arguments are, how are we going to address them? [interviewer] At what point did you decide, "I'm going to go after these hate groups, document their activities?" [Daryle] I'm from the punk scene. This is really where my passions really are, music and everything around it, especially the underground music scene. This is Boston. I'm Daryle Lamont Jenkins and the show you're watching is Channel X. [Daryle] Back in 2000, I was doing a series of public-access TV shows. We're going to go on with this first band. This band I had on the last Channel X show. [playing punk music] [Daryle] I was working on one that never came to fruition. I was calling it Damn the Conformist. And I went out to an American Renaissance Conference and I had a crew with me that went around to this conference. This was on April 1, 2000, and it was at the Sheraton in Reston, Virginia. So, what are you doing here? Do you hate black people? [laughing] I hate black people, all of them. They all suck. [Daryle] Me and my people just went around and videotaped everybody that we saw there. And I had to pretend I was the right because I was the only black dude there. No one really knew what American Renaissance was at the time and pretty much scared the living daylights out of me when I started realizing who some of these folks were. [interviewer in video] Maybe you could explain your interest in the American Renaissance movement for us a little bit. [man] Sure. I became interested in right-wing politics in the early '90s because I could see the way multiculturalism was going, I could see the way immigration and affirmative action were going. You know, it just seemed that none of the parties were willing to talk about things in which whites are adversely affected. But every time a non-white is adversely affected, it becomes national news. It was the first time I had gotten a chance to be just basically up-close and personal with neo-Nazi. Forced racial integration leads to disharmony and I think that's been consistent all over the world. [Daryle] And it basically just got the ball rolling to what eventually became One People's Project. How do you square this with the fact that America is essentially a nation of immigrants? Well, first of all, that's not true. There's no such thing as a nation of immigrants. We were an extension of England, which is why we have English language, British political and social institutions. The media in this country controls political opinion in this country. And the majority of people who own the media in this country are Jewish, yeah, people like Michael Eisner. [interviewer] So, would you say there's a Zionist conspiracy in American major media? I hate the word "conspiracy" because it starts sounding like you're a crackpot. We're talking about UFOs now, you know. But is there a Jewish influence in the media? I think anybody-- [interviewer] An overpowering Jews influence. Overpowering Jewish influence in the media, yes. And I think they use it shamelessly for their own agenda. Races will be happier, more adjusted, and harmonious when they're pretty much associated with their own kind, OK? [man] I'll give you an example. Whenever David Duke starts getting popular, there is an endless stream of Holocaust movies all week. Right? Then there's an endless stream of Klan movies. And then they have the History Channel showing the history of the Klan over and over again even though Mr. Duke was in the Klan 30 years ago. No one in his group was ever involved in any illegal activities. He was a young man looking to be able to find some way to stand up for his European heritage. At the time, there was only one group, the Klan. I'm heading down to Richmond, Virginia, and there's been a call for a blackout or a black boycott of a shopping center because the county has dared to recognize Confederate History Month. And I say, if it's OK to represent or recognize Black History Month, why not represent and recognize the heritage of Virginia and the heritage of the South? I think we're heading towards a major catastrophe in this country. [birds chirping] [Daryle] So, normally, I fly down or I take the bus. This is pretty much my fourth time coming down here for this. Hopefully, it'll be the last. I don't know if Taylor wants to do this again in this town, especially now, there's some serious opposition that we may be seeing against this conference. I mean, got a lot of media attention this time around, which it never did before. It's called the American Renaissance Conference, and, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, it's an extremist group that promotes the studies and research to show the inferiority of blacks to whites. So the heat's on American Renaissance this time. The heat's on Jared Taylor. [Jared] From 1994 until 2008, we had conferences every other year just in private hotels. We really never had much of a problem. In 2010, the hotels that we contracted with, and there were four, back to back. Every one of them got so much pressure they canceled on us. And so, we weren't able to have a conference. And then, the next year, we had the same thing happen again. People threatening to block their parking lot, people coming on the premises and leafleting their places saying, "These people support Nazis," all kinds of baloney. So, now we meet only in government-owned facilities. It's supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. [Daryle] This was a government-owned facility, a publicly owned facility that could not shut their doors to them once the contracts are signed, which means not only can they not throw them out, but they also can't throw anybody in the general public out, and that includes us. The state of Tennessee has a First Amendment obligation. If the state of Tennessee had told us we couldn't meet, we'd sue them and they'd lose. The fact is that Jared Taylor, year after year after year, while saying that he has nothing personal against the Jews, has made his conferences a welcome home for Nazis. [Lacy] As you can see, we actually slept last night in a church. Thank goodness for this church that put us up last night. Some people slept in here, in the sanctuary. I saw it on Facebook that they were protesting and they were looking for accommodations locally. And I called our priest and said, "Do you mind? That this would be-- You know, it's part of our mission, from a standpoint of community and love and acceptance and anti-hate," and so, we opened up the church. [interviewer] Have you done this in the past? No. I think it's a reflection of the political climate, where I think we all have to do what we can. [Daryle] If you need other antifascist voices in general, I want to connect y'all, so he can also speak. Public doxxed antifascist, you know, and anarchist. Well, this is all self-made. This is-- I basically got handed this and then I got this thing strapped over here just in case, you know. I'm not trying to start anything by any means, but there've been many organizers and many activists who've been, uh, attacked. [inaudible] I saw this black African gentleman, I assumed he was on the crew and he refused to shake my hand. And they surprised me that I was actually going to be talking to this African. Look at the average life of an African-American in the U.S. It's far better than any African living in Africa. So, slavery was good for them? I-- How can you deny such an obvious fact? -It's such a ridiculous notion. -How is it ridiculous? [Richard] We are just outside of Nashville, Tennessee, at the Montgomery Bell State Park. I'm a guest to the conference this year, although I will be saying a few words just as an update on what I'm doing. But, otherwise, I'm just here to listen to some talks and mingle. [Jared] This is the first time we actually had to shut down registration a month before the conference. We have about 300 people here. I think it would have been 400 or 450 if we had not bumped up against the physical constraints of the room. I've been curious to know how many of you have come to your first American Renaissance Conference. Wow. [applause] [John] I got a hold of Richard Spencer's phone number and I put it on Facebook. And, after that, I got a call from some Nazi alt-right. There were several. It was a conference call and they called me and they started putting me on different alt-right message forums and boards. -[Lacy] That's Hotel Avenue, I think. -Yeah. [Daryle] Yeah, this is it. where are we? Oh, that's where we are. -Hello, sir. NAACP? -[Benny] Yeah. I'm Daryle Lamont Jenkins. I'm with One People's Project. [Jared] In the last, I would say two or three years, there's been, in historical terms, an absolute explosion of white racial consciousness, a rising determination of whites to defend their own interests. We have a chance, a fighting chance. Testing, testing. [over megaphone] Testing. We will be protesting in favor of equality. [crowd] Yes! In favor of diversity! [crowd cheering] ...the view that all cultures are equally valid, all religions equally true, and what is at the heart of this fallacy, that all races are interchangeable and equivalent. The other tectonic plate moving in the opposite direction, that's us, we are growing in size. And you know what happens when tectonic plates meet? Earthquakes. We had a tremor, I would call it a reasonably significant tremor, in the election of Donald Trump. But that is just a sign of things to come. [applause] And how did the other side react? -Yeah! -[applause] -Yeah! -[crowd] Yeah! Yeah! I want to hear a word from y'all! -Now! -[crowd] Now! -Now! -[crowd] Now! -Now is the time! -[crowd] Now is the time! -Now is the time! -[crowd] Now is the time! Now is the time to take action! [crowd] Now is the time to take action! -Oh, no, no, no. -[laughs] I know that was a lot of words, but I wanna hear that. Now is the time... [crowd] Now is the time... ...to take action! [crowd] ...to take action! [Daryle] Now is the time... [crowd] Now is the time... -[Daryle] ...for them... -[crowd] ...for them... -...to hear... -...to hear... -...from us! -...from us! -This is not their town! -This is not their town! -This is not their park! -This is not their park! -This is not their state! -This is not their state! -This is not their society! -This is not their society! -This is not their decision! -This is not their decision! Let me hear you all yell it out, y'all. [crowd cheering] No racist USA! No Klan, no hate! No racist USA! No Klan, no hate! No racist USA! No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA! No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA! No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA! [Jared] We do expect the demonstrators to be very close. We have been more than urged by the Tennessee state police here who are protecting us, the park police, very much discourage any kind of interaction with the demonstrators. I know that we all have a curiosity about these people. One might want to just go up and even just have a sniff. -[laughs] -But... Please, control those impulses. If there is any kind of fisticuffs or even a loud argument, you know that we will be blamed. If we will be blamed, I will be blamed, and I know where every one of you lives. [audience laughing] [crowd] KKK has got to go! -[Lacy] Hey hey, ho ho. -[crowd] KKK has got to go! -Hey hey, ho ho. -[crowd] KKK has got to go! Yay, everybody, you all can see the zoo animals. [woman] Hey hey, ho ho, KKK has got to go! [man] Nobody cares about that racist white supremacist shit. Nobody gives a fuck. I think, in a lot of ways, one of the worst things that happened to our country is actually going to be one of the best things that has happened to our country. Since that day in November, I'd never felt like as if I needed to just sit on my couch anymore. So, yeah. -[Daryle] Yeah, I think there-- -Here we are. [Daryle] I remember seeing a sign just recently say that, if Hillary had won, we'd be in brunch right now. -Yes. -And it's like, no. -That's the problem. -See, that was my problem. I was part of the problem. I was part of the problem. -It's absolutely true. -You're not now. No. What does the end game look like for a movement? How do we get there and what does it look like when we win? I would be prepared to draw a line right down the middle of the U.S. and say to all non-whites, "Hey, you pick which side you want. Which side do you want? We'll just fill in the rest." If that's what it takes to keep us from being ground steadily down into the increasingly hated minority that is our thing if we do nothing, I believe that is the aspiration that we should look for. [applause] [Richard] Jared and I have different styles. Jared has been more on the side of race realism based in scientific reasoning. My view is that we're probably going to accomplish a lot more by thinking magically and cut right to emotions. You know, as the old Chinese proverb goes, "May you live in interesting times." We are living in them. We are living probably in a breaking point. And I love it. Um, I'm very happy to be alive and I'm very happy to wake up every day and do all this stuff. So, on August 12th, in Charlottesville, there's going to be a really amazing rally that was organized by someone who's here, Jason Kessler. And almost all of the alt-right is going to be there and it is going to be hugely dramatic, probably hugely traumatic for them, the liberal people of Charlottesville. Let's see where they go next. -And wherever they go... -[woman] Chase them there. ...we'll chase them there. Yup. There we are. -That's our mission in life. -[woman] Well, thank you. I lived in Charlottesville for about five years. I went to college there. I remember the statues quite well. It's going to be fun. They will never forget it. [Lacy] You can't run over people who aren't white! -That's not right! -[honking] You can't run us over! No, that's not happening! You're not running anyone over. [man] Racists! Have a nice drive, fucker! Oh-oh, did something bad happen? [police sirens] -[man] Jim, let's go inside. -I'm sorry. We'd better go check and see what happened. [woman 1] There is only a few. There, somebody is fighting. [woman 2] He killed our friends! [man yelling] [woman 2] He killed our friends! Come on! Come on! [woman yelling] [Daryle] John ended up with just a few scrapes and bruises, but apparently the guy that attacked him was a little worse off. I guess they ended up having to airlift him to a hospital in Nashville to further attend to him. [man 1] All they'll say right now is that they are both under arrest. But it wasn't his fault though, right? -No. He defended himself. -[man 2] He was defending himself. [Jared] I have an unfortunate announcement to make. One of our members has disobeyed me, and engaged with the ANTIFA and has now gone to the hospital. It is vitally important that this sort of thing not happen. The best thing we can do is ignore them. What they most want, is to get a rise out of us. We're supposed to be a relatively high IQ race. [audience laughs] We are supposed to be able to set rules and follow them. I'm very angry that this happened. This will reflect on all of us, on American Renaissance, and all of you here. And so... I implore you... Do not imitate this knucklehead. He got into a fisticuffs with one of four or five of their guys, ended up taking an involuntary swim. And was lead off in handcuffs and is now in the hospital. Don't let this happen again. [people cheering and applauding] [Daryle] I'm happy with how things turned out. We had a remarkable turnout. I want to keep the momentum going. I want to make sure that everybody is aware of the kinds of things that we got to fight out there, and actually fight them. [interviewer] Will you be returning to that venue again? Sure. Yeah. We have a contract. We'll be there last weekend of April. You've been coming to this-- [Daryle] A lot of people are scared. They don't want to be helpless anymore. They wanna come out and don't want things to get worse. [Richard] Hi, everyone, this is Richard. I just got back and I just wanted to give a quick report on the weekend. The conference was unequivocally a success. Clearly something big is happening. And it's not just people who are coming, it is younger people. Everyone's getting connected and getting organized. They're meeting people at Amber, they're gonna see them again in Charlottesville. They're going to go to a college event. It allows us to build upon events. Take them down! Take them down! [yelling indistinctly] [Mark] Most of these were open celebrations of white supremacy. Just to give an example, in a little town called Colfax, Louisiana, there is in fact an obelisk put up in 1920 which commemorates as brave heroes, the three white men who were killed during a white massacre of a 150 black unionists after they surrendered. I just think it's unbelievable that any civilization can put up a monument to the three people who died in the mass murder of a 150 people. They're celebrated as great heroes of the community. There are people all over this country, particularly in the South, so-called neo-Confederates, who will not accept what it is those monuments really stand for. The claim is made repeatedly that the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery. And let me say that is patently 100% false. [Richard] Monuments being torn down is a symbol of white dispossession. We talked about this issue of the monuments and being torn down in New Orleans and so on. [man] This is tyranny! What's the reason for anything that we've got in this country if you can't stand behind it? [people protesting] [crowd cheering] [Richard] It's an attack on European history, on white history. It's also symbolic of a greater desire to erase us. [interviewer] How far should we go in terms of taking down these statues? I mean, look, I think when we have monuments that expressly celebrate white supremacy, I think that can come right down. [crowd cheering] [Richard] We said we should get on this because this is great symbolism. We said, "Oh, let's do something Charlottesville, they're moving to take down the Lee and Jackson statues." There might be hundreds, thousands of people descending on Charlottesville. So, it's going to be crazy. [protestors] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You will not replace us! You will not replace us! [cameraman] There is very little police presence. There's a group of anti-demonstrators. They are completely surrounded inside the group of torchlight demonstrators. [all protesting] It looks like we got a fight. There's definitely a fight inside. [people clamoring] [cameraman] Police have not stepped in. Can I ask why you guys aren't stepping in? Sir, turn this off. [cameraman] I'm just wondering why you have not intervened yet. [man] What's wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me! Everything is wrong with you! [inaudible] [Richard] A year ago, we weren't doing things like Charlottesville. All of that activism was not taking place a year ago and it's taking place now. Get in. Get in. [Richard] The alt-right has developed clearly. I mean, I'm very pleased with that. [Daryle] As they grow, we grow. Does not necessarily mean people dressed in black coming to break windows or whatever. It also means community people, folks going through their day to day just simply saying, "Hey, look, we don't want this. We can't have this." There's always going to be more of us. [Richard] Is this us? Is DFC-- I'm just curious those buses-- [man] Yes, those are us. -[Richard] So, they are with us, right? -[man] Yeah. [Richard] I'm actually going to get a little whiskey. Yeah, I just want a touch just to get loosened up. Get back that all cocky Spencer confidence right. -[man 1] Hail victory. -[Richard] Hail victory. Thanks for coming, guys. -[man 2] Hail victory. -[Richard] Hail victory. -[woman cheering] -[Richard] Yeah. -[applause] -[Richard] Yeah. Hail victory, guys. Hail victory. Hey, Max. Good to see you, man. Hail victory. Hey, Mike. [honking] [Richard] I don't know what's going on with Trump. I mean, I don't want to quite hate him. Well, we got Jews running us, so what do you expect? [Richard] Right. Right. [David] What do you expect with Jews running our country? [Richard] This might very well go off totally peacefully, this might become violent. I mean, that is certainly within the realm of possibilities. Basically, my policy is just absolutely never back down. [man] I thought it was disgusting that a bunch of American vets with weapons are out protecting a bunch of Nazis. My granddaddy fought the Nazis in World War II. [Daryle] Yeah! [man with Daryle] The Nazis were protected by these patriot militias with weapons. [yelling] [cameraman] Can I ask what group you guys are with? [Richard] This is the one place where we can win and win quickly. It's remarkable. The right loses culturally and so on, but... [man] Don't record me, nigger! [Richard] ...in terms of the free speech issue and the ability to publicly demonstrate, we're winning. [people yelling] [cameraman] There is literally no police around. [people protesting] [man yelling] Hey, hey, get off! [indistinct bangers] [bangers continue] [yelling] How can you love God and hate other people? You can't. [honking] [people clamoring] [men shouting indistinctly] [Daryle] They went to the wrong area. They were supposed to go over there, and it was there when everybody just started raising hell at 'em and, uh... and fisticuffs began. One guy took a flag from Antifa. I actually tried to take it back. [yelling] Yeah, another fucking cock-sucking Nazi. [man] Fucking pussies! [Daryle] And all hell broke loose again. Apparently, he got dealt with because, um, I got pictures of him with a really bloody puffed up face. [yelling] Let's go, Nazis! [man] Come on! [cameraman] Police are just doing nothing. Police are still not stepping in despite multiple fights breaking out. [man] No one is going to get out of here. [cameraman] Why haven't you guys intervened in the fighting? [man] There was fighting all over the place and officers just stood there and did nothing. Nothing. I got it on tape. Nothing. [cameraman] Why didn't you guys intervene in any of the fighting? It's 2017 and I don't know why they keep on letting this shit happen. [cameraman] The streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, look like a battleground. [people clamoring] [woman] Call the police! Where are the police? [cameraman] There seems very little government response to this incredibly large riot. Shoot! Fire the first shot in the race war, baby! Shoot! Go ahead, motherfucker. I'm telling you, I'll shoot you. [indistinct shouting] [woman] We are right! [woman] They are wrong! We are right! [police sirens] [woman] They are wrong! [policeman on megaphone] By authority of the Commonwealth of Virginia, this event has been declared an unlawful assembly. If you do not leave the area immediately, you will be arrested. Do not interfere with law enforcement. [police sirens] [cameraman] All right, police are pushing me out. [helicopters whirring] [yelling] [gunshot] [cameraman] That certainly sounded like a gunshot. [Daryle] Shots were being fired. [Richard] I heard what I thought then was a gunshot and I was like, "Wow, this is really going south. We've got to get out." [Richard] Sir, I will surrender-- [yelling] Stop. Stop. Sir, Stop. [man] Why are you attacking us? [police officer] These guys hate you out there, man. You don't have to do this. -[Richard] Sir. -Get up. Get up. [man] Stand on your feet. Stand on your feet, guys. -[shouts] -[Richard] Stop. [Richard] Stop. I'm not resisting. -[indistinct bangers] -[people clamoring] [cameraman] It looks like teargas here. [Daryle] My whole body was on fire and I couldn't blink, I couldn't rub my eyes. I mean, it was bad. It's the first time this has ever happened because I usually stay out of the fight. [cameraman] What happened this time? Well, I was trying to help somebody and, uh, somebody from TWB took a shot at me with a pepper spray. So, yeah, he got me. [woman] You need to call someone? No, I'm OK. Those who I need to call are here. Hit me with-- Any water? -My ear is on fire. -[woman] OK. OK. I have some. Here. -OK. -Hit me, hit me, go ahead. [woman] Go right into the ear. [man with Daryle] After two hours of streetfight, finally the cops stepped in, the cops stepped in, but they waited till noon. They let that stuff go for two hours before they did anything about it. This is the worst example of police enforcement I've ever seen in anything like this. I photographed stuff from back in Vietnam, protests. I've never seen police just stand around and let stuff like this go on for hours. [policeman on megaphone] Do not intervene with law enforcement. [Jared] The Charlottesville police had a legal obligation to provide protection. Perhaps you've read the report that's come out recently now. But it's very clear that the police were under orders to let a certain amount of violence happen. [Richard] Hey, everyone, I'm safe and sound. We were standing our ground. And the police who came out in just full riot gear. I mean, they were pushing us and then kicking us in the shins underneath the shields. Uh, but I have to be honest, I am absolutely outraged at the conduct of the city of Charlottesville and the police. [cameraman] Police aren't even in this area. I'm seeing fights break out right now. [people clamoring] [man] Hey, somebody help! [cameraman] You guys all right? [men clamoring] [man] Hey, stand down right now! -Now! -Hit him! Get up! [coughing] -No! Hey! Get him! -Hey, help him! Somebody help him! Hey, stand out right now! Stop, get back! Go! -Stand down! -Now! Go! I came here to speak my mind, to talk about our movement's ideas, and I was attacked. We are gonna make Charlottesville the center of the universe. We are going to come back here often. We're going-- Your head's going to spin [stuttering] how many times we're going to be back here. [people clamoring] You motherfuckers! You dance like this! -Fuck you! -You know-- Fuck you! [car accelerating] [people screaming] [brakes screeching] [woman] Holy shit! [woman] Holy shit! Holy shit! [cameraman] Go, go, go, go. [people clamoring] [man yelling] Why? [cameraman] We got multiple injuries. Possible fatalities. I'm assuming a white nationalist ran a huge crowd of people. I just saw it. Where are the police and the ambulances? I cannot believe what just happened. I've never seen anything like that in my life. [TV hostess] Breaking news. Terror in Charlottesville. Victims thrown in the air, one woman dead, others critically wounded. [TV hostess 2] James Fields Junior is facing a number of charges. He's charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit-and-run. [interviewer] Why not just condemn her killing? I certainly condemn her killing in the sense that I certainly did not want it to happen and I think it's a sad thing. But I'm not going to play into their game in the sense of denouncing the movement or saying that hate killed her or-- [people clamoring] We expected there will be some loss of life in the age of Trump at the hands of these right-wing extremists, and we just were not prepared for that being the way. I think that Charlottesville... was an incredibly big deal. It was something that caused people to realize that you can't ignore the Nazis. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? [President Trump] You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. We understand that President Trump has reached out. Have you talked to him directly yet? I have not and now I will not. I'm not talking to the President now, I'm sorry. [TV hostess] What did you-- After what he said about my child. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. [Daryle] I expected Trump to be an idiot about it and he didn't disappoint. What always is going to upset me when it comes to Trump, however, is just how helpless the general public feels they are. [crowd cheering] [Richard] The idea that I would ever back down to such a little creep like Mayor Signer, we are never backing down. [crowd] Yeah! [crowd cheering] [McAuliffe] We got to call it out for what it is. It is hatred, it is bigotry and our leaders got to be very frank, unequivocal. We will not tolerate that in our country. [crowd cheering] I think it'd be hard to find anyone who would say that this was some sort of great victory. As a result of Charlottesville, Confederate memorials all around the country suddenly came down. The idea was to defend one. And it had absolutely reverse effect. The consequences of that rally and of Heather Heyer's death was this widespread so-called de-platforming of anyone who is considered to support any kind of white racial consciousness or racial nationalism. [people talking indistinctly] [people talking indistinctly] Yesterday-- Fuck you, asshole! Fuck off, Jason! Shut the fuck up-- Indict for murder now! Indict for murder now! -[man] Get the fuck out of here! -Indict for murder! He invited these people! Indict for murder now! [people clamoring] Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go! [man] Her name was Heather, jerk! Her name was Heather, Jason! Her blood is on your hands. So, please, go home and never come back. [cameraman] All right, we are live. We are live. We're live. OK, guys, let's do it. -Let's go. -Let's go. Move. [cameraman] We are peacefully here. [Richard] Yes, we are not breaking any law in fact. [man 2] Well, but you're assholes. [indistinct chattering over police radio] [cameraman] We said we would be back. We are back. You can see we are peacefully walking. [woman] What are you guys doing? [cameraman] Peacefully walking. You all can be witnesses. Peacefully walking. [man] Jesus Christ... [indistinct chattering over police radio] Formations are just filling right here. This goes up to the front. This goes up there. -Fill in. -Yes, up there. You guys form up with the statue at your back. Form up with the statue at your back, at your rear. Face out. Face out. [cameraman] We're by the statue, it's covered up in black. That's a sad sight. Here. You will not replace us! You will not replace us! You will not replace us! You will not replace us! You will not replace us! You will not replace us! [Matt Christman] These guys who marched in Charlottesville, these are the people who are aware of the unspoken premise of this sort of zombie neo-liberalism we're living in, which is that we're coming at a point where there's going to be ecological catastrophe and it's going to either require mass redistribution of the ill-gotten gains of the first world or genocide. This is where the White House is. We're going to get to 17th Street, take a right, come back-- [Matt] And these are the first people who have basically said, "Well, if that's the choice, I choose genocide." ...in my opinion, it could be taken without the authorization of Congress, uh, is building a wall. -So, that's my speech basically. -Yeah. [Richard] I think that will be five to ten minutes. If I can try to get you to work on it, then we have to be able to talk about it. [Matt] And they're getting everybody else ready, intellectually and emotionally, for why that's going to be OK when it happens. [interviewer] So, with statistics showing white people soon becoming a minority in this country, do you ever feel like you're just fighting a losing battle? No. Demographics are creating this. They are doing it for us. It's not me convincing millions of people through rational argumentation. It's their lived experience as a minority white in a country that once was theirs. [Jared] I don't make my decisions on my chances of winning. I make my decisions according to what is right, the duty I owe to my ancestors, my obligations to my children. And I think we will win. [Matt] When putting all this money into more fucking walls and drones and bombs and guns to keep them away and so that we can watch them die, with clear consciences, it's going to be because we've been loaded with the ideology that these guys are now starting to express publicly. On the other side of them, you have people who are saying, in full fucking voice, "No." [crowd] Immigrants are welcome here! [Matt] We have the resources to save everybody, to give everybody a fucking decent and worthwhile existence. And that is the fucking real difference between these two. This is not right and you know it! [Lacy] This is a really important fight. In the long term, we have to win this one. We have to win this one. If they win, if the alt-right wins, what we're looking at is [sighs] incredible suffering and people dying. I'm calling on you, Donald Trump, build that wall! [man] Nazi scum! You owe it to every single person who voted for you! [Daryle] I think that Spencer is basically just going through the motions now. Spencer did not want to be the carnival barker. Spencer did not want to be just in the streets basically parroting what everyone has heard from white-supremacists over the past 50 years. He could have been Senator Spencer at this point. Daryle Lamont Jenkins was in Charlottesville, Virginia, and he outed a lot of the KKK guys. [applause] [Daryle] I'm one of the few Antifa, you may have heard that term before, anti-fascists. I'm one of the few that you would see in public. A lot of us do not like to be in public. A lot of us can't. And it's on their behalf that I take this award. It is on the behalf of those victims of hatred and bigotry that I accept this award. Fuck off, Nazi scum! Fuck off, Nazi scum! Fuck off, Nazi scum! Fuck off, Nazi scum! Fuck off, Nazi scum! Fuck off, Nazi scum! Fuck off, Nazi scum! I go out there and try to document every single thing that is going on in the white power scene or in the hate scene in general. That's the way we are all going to learn how to beat it back, how to keep it down, how to diminish their ability to function. And one thing that needs to be said is that evil can only do what we allow it to do. We are stronger than anything that is coming our way. [crowd] No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA! [Daryle] Truth of the matter is we all got to step up. We cannot ignore what's out there. We got to fight back. And the only way we can do that is when we get up in their face and tell them, "This far, but no farther." Thank you very much. [crowd cheering and applauding] [Matt] Fascism arises because of the collapse of institutional legitimacy of liberal institutions. So, it's how we got fucking Trump, it's how we're going to get what's coming next after him that's going to be even worse. If you think there's not gonna be more ecological and economic catastrophes in the future... [TV host] Strong worry is that it's about to get worse. [Matt] ...that liberalism is wholly unsuited to fucking deal with and that that failure is not going to lead to fascism filling that fucking hole, you got another thing coming. [men clamoring] [interviewer] So, America right now is more divided and polarized than it has been in decades. How's the country gonna come together? I don't think the country will come together and I don't want it to. Maybe we can't be a nation anymore. Maybe race and culture and ethnicity and religion, maybe those are really real things. And we're not gonna come together. [interviewer] At this point, we're the most divided as a country we've been-- -I disagree. -No? -You disagree? -Yes. I disagree. We're not divided. We're not divided the way people may think we are. We're frustrated, we want questions answered, but we're not divided.
