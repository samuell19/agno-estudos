The Third World War ended swiftly, thanks to the use of modern military technology. No victor emerged. After the war, only remnants of battle remained. Pandemics and other threats followed. Every life takes desperate measures in the name of survival. The era of technology is gone. Humanity enters a dark age. The strong live peacefully. The weak starve and become victims. Wealth represents everything in this new society. Just staying alive is a struggle. It'll be your bum, not my bum So I'll only hit yours The Mon hides the knife And I'll cut you from behind Here, there are no laws, no rules. It'll be your back, not my back So I'll only stab you Every life is borne out of atrocities. "Kill or be killed" is the norm every single minute of the day. Hello, Sibthit. We broke up. Men can go fuck themselves. The Mon hides the knife And I'll cut you from the back Whoever sits unaware Shall be cut in the back It'll be your back, not my back So I'll only stab you Run, what are you doing? You're so heartless. Don't you wanna eat? Two bags, please. I'll share them with the security guard. The security guard or your Burmese boyfriend? My boyfriend is not Burmese. He's a Mon. The Mon hides the dick And I'll chew the head It'll be your head, not my head So I'll only chew your head Head of what? Dic… It's tonight. Where are you off to, darling? - Hello, Madame Runaway, how are you? - I'm doing fine. That's Madame Runaway. She runs away from debtors. Are you boys gonna keeping fighting to the death? Snakes! How much is it? Three hundred. Here you are, 300. Bitch. It's so expensive. Study hard, boys, so you can be like me when you grow up. Want some? Watch the bike. You drive too fast. It'll get you killed. What is this? Why do you always do that? I hate it when a fly lands on the tip of the straw. Makes it too dirty to suck on it. That's why you boys keep your dicks pointing down in your underpants. What? Why do boys keep their dicks pointing down in their underpants? I don't know. You really don't know? Can I see? Irene! I don't wear underpants. Really? Let me see. Irene. Fine, I won't look. You're so uptight. One round only. First one to reach the goal wins. Have you been in a game before? I've never lost one. I'll give you a head start. No need. I've heard about you… Irene. Fear. Run. Careful. Run! Asshole! How would you throw in a knife! Careful, Run. Run. Run. Run! Run, you won! Run, you won! We won! Run. I didn't expect your fighter to end up like that. Brother Ma, where did you find this girl? Was she expensive? Forget about it. It's nothing like that. Are you proud of stabbing people in the back? Do we know each other? The fuck are you looking at? Sorry, dude. Wanna fight? Leo, see Brother Ma off. No need. I'm familiar with this area. I'm not worried about you getting lost. I'm worried that you'll take my things with you when you leave. I never do things behind people's backs. I do it in front of them, when I'm looking into their eyes. You'll have a heart attack. Irene. But I didn't do anything. If you don't know me, then you don't have the right to judge me. Let it go, Run. Come on, Fear. Let's go. Come on. He's so hot. If you hadn't stopped me, they'd be dead meat by now. Dead meat? You're the one who started it. You always cause trouble. You two, wait for me in the car. Yes, sir. Listen. If you want to keep working for me, you need to… Again. Understand? Yes, sir. Make way. The big shot is here. What are you looking at? I should slap your face with money. Make way. Run. Your share. Thank you so much. Are you crazy? Don't you want money? Look, this is big money. Run. Do you know that woman was? No. I have no idea why she's so angry. You know, the guy who was with her is so handsome. I just said he's handsome, it's not like I want him. I'm hurt, and all you care about is men. I know you're good, or I wouldn't have asked you to join the game. CRACK THE GAME DOWN If they can't stop it, they should legalize it. There are so many gambling dens. They'll never get rid of them all. "Tradi-Fornication"? If it's a fornication game, I'd like to join myself. Tradition shouldn't be this fucked up. They know nothing about passing on traditions. Run, don't be so sensitive, or I'll smash your face in. If you win Tradi-Fornication, you'll be rich. Hey. Stop it. Okay. Will you be sending your team to Tradi-Fornication this year? You just got here. Eat something first. Let's talk business later. Still don't trust me, huh? The police are outdated. If I were you, I'd have a soldier around instead. It's safer. Kavin, why should you be the Gamemaster? I can handle Tradi-Fornication without you. But will the others accept you as the Gamemaster? Besides, I hear Boss hasn't had much use for you lately. Well, to answer your question… they'll accept me when you're no longer around. I come here to invite you politely to be the manager. If you think you can be the Gamemaster, be my guest. Kavin, even your server got shut down. Your management style is outdated. Why don't you let someone else manage it? Are you in or not? That's all I need to know! Brother Ma. Don't open the lid or the congee will get cold. You have to be careful. It can burn your hands. What is this? Do you get scalds very often? Why do you need this balm, then? I'm a clumsy man. Is that so? Then you should let Mr. Kavin do his job. We can talk about this another time. Mr. Kavin is looked after by the police. Maybe you should wait till you find a soldier to look after you. Very well. I'll send someone to participate. This year, we need a sponsor fee of 30 million. If I win, all the sponsor fees go to me. Deal. What's the rush? Come on, eat something. I hate Chinese food. You made the right choice. The only thing you're good at, Kavin, is kissing Boss's ass. If you'd let me carry a gun, they would've been dead by now. So what if they're cops. You'd kill a cop? I'm your right-hand man. I'd do anything for you. Check if the congee has turned cold. It's still hot. I told you, I'm your right-hand man. I'd do anything for you. But I'm left-handed. Are you sure this is what you want? I'm sure. In order to end Tradi-Fornication and this outrageous status quo, we must take down Kavin. Even if you manage to take him down, someone else is just gonna take his place. I know. But it's better than doing nothing. Okay. I'll get intel on him for you. What do you want? If this was a brothel, I'd be here for something else, but since this is a garage, I'm here about my car. What's wrong with it? The radiator's broken. Is it leaking? Wanna check for yourself? I need to know if it should be changed. TRADI-FORNICATION Don't tell me you're interested in joining Tradi-Fornication. I see. You're like a moth being drawn to the flame. Do you want your car fixed or not? I don't have all day. Are you in a hurry? Let's just get it done. Let's get yours wet. Excuse me. Check, please. Bring me a burger. Put it on the tab. I meant my tab. What do you want? Kavin asked me to approach you. For Tradi-Fornication? But you're a cop. I want a comfortable life. In case you're wondering why I work for him. A lowlife like you… I'm not surprised at all that you would work for him. You'll make a lot of money. Just because I let you buy me a meal doesn't mean I'll whore myself out to you. Calm down. Nobody is whoring anyone out. Really? But I can smell a whore nearby. A burger for you. Wait. Can you bring me a McWhore burger? Just the burger, hold the whore. There's a whore right here. You mean him? Haven't you met a manwhore before? Why are you still here? Fuck off. I get it. I know you must think I'm a crooked cop. Not just that. I think you're a scumbag too. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do. Catch my drift? You should join the game. It's not easy for someone without sponsorship to get an invitation. This is a good opportunity for you. You didn't listen to a thing I said, did you? Anyway, thank you for the meal. McWhore burger for you. Are you tired? Why should we listen to Kavin? Boss is the one who calls the shots anyway. But we don't know who's backing Kavin. We could be right at the top. We don't need Kavin's help to do that. I can find the sponsor fee to send you to Tradi-Fornication. If you win, you can meet Boss. We'll get rid of him. Together. Then we'll both be the new Boss. I'm serious. And where will you get the sponsor fee? Don't worry about that. I'll get it from the officials. I'll get rid of Kavin and Boss. Then we'll have all the money we could ever want. Are you working for the officials… or are you working for Kavin? Don't worry. I'm working for you. Run, did you send all your money to your mom? Brother Ma sent his man to ask me if you'd want to join Tradi-Fornication. On the delivery day, there won't be many guards in Kavin's casino. Most of his men will be sent to work outside. Kavin will be working on the accounts and issue orders from his office upstairs. That's our window. I know the risks, but it's better than living with the status quo. If more Kavins take his place after I kill him, I'll just keep getting rid of them. Stop! Enough! You're messing up my joint. You, come here. Are you Fear? You're a tough one. Be careful. Whose side is that cop on anyway? His name is Payu. I don't know if he's a spy for the officials? Maybe he's just looking out for himself. No one can rely on the officials. Run. Run. Run! What? There's word going around in the group chat that Kavin will reveal his pick for Tradi-Fornication soon. Who's it gonna be? Oh, you're up. That's enough. Let's have a friendly chat. I'm not interested. Do you know how many of my men you've killed? You've shot up my house. I've heard a lot about you, and you've lived up to your reputation. Not bad. I know you're a loyal girl too. It was so easy to find them. I have a lot of people working for me. You son of a bitch! Trust me and do as I say, and you'll make a fortune. If you win, that is. Yes, Boss? What's your problem? I've asked you a million times… but you always rejected my offer. What changed your mind? Why are you approaching me this time? I want to make money. Do you know what drives people to fight? Hunger. Desire. If you're hungry, you can survive off of trash. But humans will always desire to eat and live better than others. People with no discipline always cause violence. Do you know how we can create social order and stop violence? By being more violent than them. If I don't do that, I can't rule over them. If you want to stand at the top, you have to be decisive. I agree. I've never seen anyone as decisive as you, Brother Ma. We all need to work for someone, so that society can continue to exist. Even if someone at the top of the food chain gets consumed at the end, that's the circle of life. Who are you working for, then? I've never seen his face. But he will decide if I'm allowed to be your sponsor. Now that you know about Boss, there are only two ways that you can leave this place. First, as someone who works for Boss. Second… as a corpse. Yes, sir. What did Boss say? You're lucky that… I won't need to use this liquid. And that means… I'll be your sponsor. Where have you been all week? We're going to join Tradi-Fornication. You… and who? Payu? No, silly, I mean us. Kavin's already announced that he'll be Fear's sponsor. Didn't you hear? I can find us a sponsor. If we win, we don't need to work for Kavin anymore. It doesn't matter. Even when Kavin's gone, you'll spread your legs for someone else. You think I don't know that? It'd be strange if you didn't. You mean me and Payu, right? Everyone. You've fucked everyone on this planet, except me. I never had a chance. Do you want to fuck me? Once you're inside me, you'll be no different from all the other men in the world. You think I'm stupid enough not to fuck you? If everybody can fuck you, then so can I! Those men didn't fuck me. I fucked them. You're important to me because I haven't fucked you. Don't like doing it from the front? I'll let you do it from behind. But if you fuck me, you'll be just another man to me. They've announced the contestants for this year's Tradi-Fornication. Imbecile. Where have you been? Everyone knows already. One of the contestants is from this neighborhood. Can I see? It's Happy. Happy. - Hmm? - Mmm. What? Let's go. Leo. Do I look pretty? Yeah. Get rid of him. Yes, sir. Damn it! How dare she do this to me?! Sir. Why didn't you get rid of them before they applied? They did everything by the rules. Should we… cancel the game? The stakes are too high. I can't let some slutty cunt destroy my business. If she wants to die like a dog on the street, let her. Who do you think is gonna win out of these seven teams? I couldn't care less. Whoever wins or loses, we get paid anyway. Will the winner get to meet Boss? None of your business. Good day to our beloved audience. Welcome to the first match of our game. It's our member's favorite, much-loved, much-admired game. It's the game of future and death. The fight that will help our contestants escape poverty. This is the first time our contestants face each other. Let's meet the contestants of our Tradi-Fornication game. Pay attention, now. It's Tradi-Fornication, not fornication. What has been the upper class's method to control the working class since ancient times? A great show. Giant stadiums. Why do you think the Romans built the Colosseum? People got so excited to watch others get killed that they forgot how miserable their own lives were. That made it easy for the rulers to control them. The rules are the same as the real musical chairs. There are six chairs and seven teams. All teams must drive in circles until the music stops. When the music stops, the players need to plant themselves on the chairs. Those who don't find a chair will be eliminated. However, the speed of the bikes cannot cross the limit into the red zone. You may be curious about what will happen if they do. If the speed crosses into the red zone while the music is still playing, this is what will happen. Well, you saw what happened. It's time to eliminate another team. We have one round left. Those who fail to find a chair won't get a second chance. Let's speed this up a little bit for our audiences back home. Just a little bit. Hurry up! The music has stopped. Whoever sits first occupies the chair. It's bye-bye to those who fail to find a chair. Move the server. Don't let the officials find it. Don't forget to send me the view rate and user ratings. Bye. Boss? Did I give you permission to look at me? I'm sorry, sir. These belonged to the last person who dared to look at me. I was just trying to make sure it was you. How can you be sure? I watched today's broadcast. You managed everything well. Thank you, sir. I called you here today because I wanted to remind you that I still exist. Don't ever give me the feeling that you think you're better than me, because I can have you replaced in a second. Yes, sir. A present for you. Proof that you're still my favorite. Thank you so much, sir. Can I ask you… Sorry. Did I close my eyes? Thank you. Happy. Run. What are you doing here? I've been looking everywhere for you. I'm spending time with my fans. Why are you out here? It's dangerous. Look, Run. Let me ask you something. What's the point of getting famous if we don't enjoy the fame? Really? Do you really think they idolize you? What if people supporting another team send someone to abduct us? You're overthinking it, there's no danger. Make way. You are so annoying. The game isn't over. It's not the time to die. Where have you been? Checking feedback. It's strange. People remember us better when we do bad things. There are two matches left. You should tell me when you go out. Why? Worried someone's gonna kill me? Leo… Wanna join me in the shower? You should've waited for me. I was hungry. - Did you buy some food? - Yeah. Did you really need to put on a disguise? I wouldn't have made it back if I hadn't. Why are people so crazy for us? We're the same as before. You sure about that? Do you know who I really am? You're a brat. Shut up. Are you afraid? Of course. Will you be okay… for tomorrow? Is it okay to not be okay? Leo. Run. I'm scared. This is the semi-final. The surviving contestants will move on to the finals. For the enjoyment of our sadistic audiences watching live across the country, the semi-final round game is… Humming and Tagging. What a shitty game. I would've been a better Gamemaster. Don't underestimate this round. This is not the children's game you remember. The team members who are not captives must dive and look for the keys to save their partners before they are asphyxiated. Those who save their partners in time will make it into the finals. If they fail, they'll be eliminated. If you are ready… Irene. Go. Go. Hey. I'll handle it. Our merciful patron has thrown in another key. Big applause for Mr. Kavin. Cruel, yet benevolent. Hey. Hey. Shit! - We have the winners for the finals round. - Happy! - But now, a dramatic scene is unfolding. - Happy! Happy! Happy! Happy! Wake up. Somebody please help! Help! Happy. Wake up. Step aside. Wake up, Happy. Please wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wow! Perfect. Why are you filming me? Film the corpse. The audiences love it. There's blood everywhere. Pan down there. Between me and Fear, who do you love more? Why do you ask me this? You saved her before me, that's why. Why'd you help her? I should be asking you why you didn't. You know CPR. We should get rid of our rivals. Hey. That woman saved you. Run saved you when you were drowning. That was part of the game. Fear. What happened to you? You're not the person I knew. Ever since… Since when? Since you fucked that bitch. It's almost the final round. Are you excited? Right now, I just want to punch that cop. Why? Are you jealous? If I ever got the chance, I'd crush him like a bug. You're so cute when you're jealous. Look at you, you're copying me. Just like me when I was kidnapped and sold… I saw a girl doing it, and I copied her. Remember the story I told you before? When I was a child, I saw someone in danger, but I looked the other way. "Hide the Knife"? I think Fear is that girl. Plenty of people get stabbed in this world full of selfish humans. If I can save someone… it might help me sleep better at night. I won't have to wake up to the image of a knife thrusting into someone's back. That's none of your business. She has nothing to do with this! You've let your lust for her get to your head. Wouldn't you fuck her if you had the chance? Look into my eyes and tell me. Wouldn't you fuck this woman that you call a slut? Are you fucking crazy?! You haven't answered me. I'd never fuck her. You didn't save her because you wanted redemption. I know what you're thinking, Run. You want to fuck her, just like I want to get fucked by Sibthit. Fear. Did you come here to stab me? Tomorrow is the final round. And? We may never meet again. So what? Oh. Haven't seen you in a while. You're mean. If I was mean to you, you wouldn't be here. Good night. Where's Irene? She should be on standby. Maybe the toilet? There's no shortcut in life. But there's a lot for us to enjoy. It's time to start. Let's begin, then, shall we? I hope I get my money's worth. We're ready to start the live stream. In this final round, we'll play a forgotten game from our childhood. Hide the Cloth! Fucking liar! Kiss-ass! But at Tradi-Fornication, we won't play the usual version of Hide the Cloth. Mr. Kavin has chosen the Mon, the player who will start the game. Please give Mr. Kavin a big hand. We're transparent. We'll start with the surgeon. Care to place a bet on any of our contestants? - Boss has sent you a message, sir. - Let's not waste any time. This is the finals. Who will survive and who will be eliminated? Who lives or dies? Win or lose? Our website is open to everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the game. Boss wants to meet me. Players sit in a circle and sing the "Hide the Cloth" song. The Mon holds a piece of cloth, walks in circle, and drops a cloth behind a player. The player who has the cloth behind their back must pick up the cloth and chase the Mon who dropped it. If the Mon is caught, he or she is eliminated. If the Mon sits down before being caught, the one who holds the cloth will become the Mon for the next round. The Mon hides the cloth The doll lurks behind… Whoever sits unaware Shall be hit on the bum It'll be your bum, not my bum So I'll only hit yours The Mon hides the cloth The doll lurks behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be hit on the bum It'll be your bum, not my bum So I'll only hit yours The Mon hides the cloth The doll lurks behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be hit on the bum It'll be your bum, not my bum So I'll only hit yours The Mon hides the cloth The doll lurks behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be hit on the bum It'll be your bum, not my bum So I'll only hit yours The Mon hides the knife I'll cut you from behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be stabbed in the back It'll be on your back, not my back So I'll only stab you The Mon hides the knife I'll cut you from behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be stabbed in the back It'll be on your back, not my back So I'll only stab you Think the cloth would just land on you? If it's not there, you have to shed blood. Whoever sits unaware Shall be shot in the head It'll be your head, not my head So I'll only shoot yours The Mon hides the knife I'll cut you from behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be stabbed in the back It'll be on your back, not my back So I'll only stab you The Mon hides the knife I'll cut you from behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be stabbed in the back It'll be on your back, not my back So I'll only stab you The Mon hides the knife I'll cut you from behind Whoever sits unaware Shall be stabbed in the back It'll be on your back, not my back It'll be on your back, not my back The Mon hides the gun I'll shoot you down Whoever sits unaware Shall be shot in the head It'll be your head, not my head So I'll only shoot yours The Mon hides the gun I'll shoot you down Whoever sits unaware Shall be shot in the head It'll be your head, not my head So I'll only shoot yours Irene. Impossible. What happened? I asked you what happened. The live stream stopped. Our server may have been shut down. What the hell?! Fear, I'm sorry. I didn't help you that day. What's happening? It'll be your head, not my head So I'll only shoot yours You were supposed to shoot me in the head. Like it? This is the Gun of Absolute Authority. Boss… You wanted to know who Boss is? This smoke gets absorbed into your blood stream quickly. Don't fucking look at me! Look at the smoke! See? Your body is absorbing it! Irene… Please… What is the truth? What? What did you ask me? You dared to ask me for the truth? You want to know what the truth is? Would you like to know the truth? I'll tell you. The truth… is… the game. The game you're playing right now is the truth. Humming and Tagging. Catching the last one in the line. Hide the Cloth. Isn't it true? Isn't that the truth of life? Did you have fun playing it? You played them. You smiled. You laughed. You sweated. Bitch. This is the truth. These games should be children's reality, not their phones! This is the truth! Let me go. Don't touch me! Every child… should be free to do what they want. They shouldn't be locked up. They shouldn't be raped! Do you understand? This is the truth! We… We can stop it. We can stop it together… without those barbaric men. Do you actually believe that? It shouldn't end like this. Don't you understand? Irene… People… need help. Help? What fucking help? I don't need any help! Stop talking nonsense! Stop! Cry. Cry. Beg for your life. Beg me to spare your life. Beg me. This world is only for the strong. The weak will not survive. History is written by the victors. That old saying about good triumphing over evil… It's just nonsense that weaklings use to comfort themselves. Righteousness belongs to winners, especially in a world where people step on each other to get to the top. Boss? What happened? Did I give you permission to look at me? I'm sorry, Boss. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You must be wondering what happened here. I've just overturned the board to start a new game. They were getting too close to me. They didn't follow my rules. In the end, there can only be one winner: Me. Look. These are the eyeballs of someone who stared at me. To stand above all others, you must be decisive. Don't you think so, Brother Ma? Do your duty as best as you can… because I'll be keeping an eye on you. From now on, no one is more important than you. Thank you so much, Boss. Thank you so much. Hide the clues, distort and betray Trick you here and there I'll make a fool of you I'll make a fool of you, not of my heart Only I will make a fool of you
