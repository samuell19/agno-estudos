Good morning, bro. It’s 3:00 in the afternoon. Weren’t you gonna look for an apartment today? [coughing] Okay. I will. I will. I just cleaned this. God! You weren’t such a pain in the ass when we were kids. Why are you all dressed up? I have a date. You have a date? What, the one I fixed you up with? From the Internet? Yep. And if she is as great as she seems, I might even forgive you for posting that ad. Uh, Todd, you never did exchange pictures, huh? Nope. It’s just a coffee date. Besides, she says she’s above average in appearance. "Above average." I-- I warned you about Internet inflation, right? Inflation? If they say "average," that means homely. Now "V.G.L."-- very good looking-- that means average. What about people that really are V.G.L.? Well, good luck finding them on the Internet. [coughing] - Good luck. - [door closes] Hi. Hi. Uh, I was wondering, are you-- - What? Watch it. - Sorry. - I thought you were this guy. - No. No. Well, okay. [chuckles] You’re not my type anyway. Oh, um-- Sorry, this is my table. You don’t have a drink or anything. Okay. This is ridiculous. You can’t just steal another person’s table. You’re not gonna make a scene, are you? You people are so dramatic. "You people"? [scoffs] And by "you people" do you mean gay people or Latino people or specifically gay Latino people? Look, I apologize. That came out wrong. I’m really sorry. Uh, how about-- - We’re both waiting for someone, right? - Yeah. Whosever date shows up first gets the table? All right. That sounds fair. Well, scoot over. There’s no chair. [chuckles] - Does that bother you? - No. No, of course not. Mmm! Do you want me to get a chair? Would you? Thank you. [exhales] - Hey, hon. - Hey. Nice catch. I’m not a catch. Oh, and modest, too. We like that. Actually, he’s not my date, Marco. He’s-- - Straight. Totally straight. I’m straight. - Straight. Mm-hmm. So was my last boyfriend. He went straight to the next man, honey. [laughing] [whispering] That must be her. - You’re dating a lesbian? - She’s not a lesbian. - Hi, hon. - Hey. - How are ya? - Great. [Marco] Hey, what can I get for you ladies? [woman] Uh, I’ll have a double cappuccino. [chuckling] How can you be so sure? Oh, gaydar. You know, straight people can develop gaydar if they spend enough time with queers. I’m guessing you haven’t done a lot of that. No, I know some qu-- gay people-- some of the other programmers at work. But you hang out with the straight boys, right? Not really. Most of them are techno-geeks. All they know is what’s in front of them on their computer screen. They even watch movies on a computer screen. How can you watch a movie on a computer screen? You need to watch it on a big screen, you know? Wait. You’re a movie buff? Totally. I’m a bit of a fanatic. Me, too. I mean, major fanatic. - Really? - Yeah. Who’s your favorite director? - Milos Forman. - Oh. - Mostly for Amadeus. - Amadeus? You’re crazy. I mean, if we’re talking Forman, what about People vs. Larry Flynt? or Cuckoo’s Nest? - That’s a classic. - Cuckoo’s Nest is, yes, but Flynt? Nah, it’s not even in the same league as Amadeus. Amadeus has the costumes, the music, the performances. Are you sure you’re not gay? [scoffs] I’m positive. Oh, my God.˯ You think that’s your date? Of course not. I’m-- I’m not delusional. But, God. He’s beautiful. Yeah? I-- I don’t like that. Too groomed and pretty. You’re telling me you wouldn’t wanna look like that if you could? Never. Okay. All right. What’s your ideal body type? You’re looking at it, my friend. No, seriously. - All right. - [chuckles] Uh, all right, that guy. See? He looks like a man. Ah, yes. Muscle boy. I can see that. - He is hot, isn’t he? - I’m not saying I’m attracted to him. I’m just saying, you know, objectively speaking, he’s masculine. I mean, not that I like masculine. Okay, okay. Yeah. Spare me the homosexual panic. I mean, even if you were attracted to him, so what? I mean, I thought that lesbian you were trying to pick up was sexy. That doesn’t mean I’m straight. I didn’t know gay guys ever felt that way about women. Well, some don’t. I mean, it’s not like we come off some assembly line in Taiwan, you know. [chuckles] [sighs] You know, I, uh-- I think my best friend in junior high might have been gay. Really? - Yeah. - You guys ever fool around? Would you-- Why would you say that? I’m not gay. No. It has nothin’ to do with gay or straight. All kids fool around if they get half a chance. All right. Define fooling around. You did, didn’t you? Nothing serious. We were 11. We were curious. Okay. I mean, I’d ask for all the gory details, but this is obviously making you uncomfortable. A little bit, but mostly I gotta take a leak. So go. Oh, please. Please get over yourself. Nobody’s gonna jump you. [fly unzips] [urinating] [urinal flushes] [water running] [urinating] Oh, hey. Um, table opened up. I-- I thought I’d better grab it. - Oh. - I mean, you’re more than welcome to join me. I’m enjoying the company. I just thought you might want your own table. Once my date shows up. - Okay. - Looks like it’s thinnin’ out anyway. - Yeah, right? - [clears throat] [both chuckle] So how long are you supposed to wait for somebody on one of these coffee dates anyway? Why are you askin’ me? I’m no expert. I guess I just assumed you’d done your share of these. Oh, you think because I’m gay, I can’t sustain a serious relationship? You think I’m out every night partying and screwing my brains out? Whoa. I not trying to be offensive. Remember what I was saying before about being dramatic? Oh. [chuckles] - I guess I kind of have been on a dating rampage lately. - Oh. But before that, I was in a monogamous relationship for five years. At least I was monogamous. - Ouch. - Yeah. I know that story. I was married once, although we sure as hell didn’t make it any five years. Technically, it was two, but that’s only because the divorce took six months. Oh. Sounds ugly. Yeah. I was a total wreck. I’m just now pulling out of it. So, are you looking to score with your date tonight? I mean, assuming she ever shows up. Or are you looking for something a little more substantial? Substantial-- that’s a good word. Yeah. I guess that’s what I’m lookin’ for. Me, too. I mean, I don’t know. Maybe I’m getting old, but sex just isn’t the big deal it was in my twenties. Don’t get me wrong. I’m still a big fan. It’s just, there are times when I’d gladly trade in a good fuck for a little decent conversation. I know what you mean. I did the whole singles bar, one-night stand thing, but after a while, I just got so bored. Some of the women I took home actually seemed to be offended - when I just wanted to talk to them. - Like about movies. Exactly. This one woman-- she had her clothes off before I could shut the door. And she’s staring at this poster I have of Amadeus, so I say, "Do you like Milos Forman?" And she says, "Well, I’ll try anything, but usually I like to be on top." [laughing] I hope my date turns out to be half as entertaining. To tell you the truth, I’m kind of nervous about meeting him. We really seemed to connect. I mean, granted, it was only through e-mail. But I don’t know. He seemed special. Did you exchange pictures? No. I mean, I didn’t want it to be about that. I mean, I know it sounds corny, but we actually talked about life, people, ideas. He’s very funny and bright. And unlike most people on the Internet, he can actually write and punctuate a coherent sentence. And plus, he’s another movie nut. What’s his name? His name is Todd. Oh, my God. [laughing] You’re Kelly, aren’t you? Yeah. Hi. - [laughing] - Jesus. Goddamn it. My brother did this. He posted the ad. In the men-seeking-men section? He’s probably laughing his ass off right now. What a son of a-- What a prick. Well, I guess you won’t be meeting people through the Internet anymore. I don’t know. I mean, other than you being the wrong gender, you seem great. And you didn’t even inflate. Excuse me? I mean, you were honest about your appearance. You are above average. Oh. Thank you. That’s very sweet. Listen, since you are technically my date, can I buy you a cup of coffee? Oh. Thanks. That’d be nice. - Black, no sugar, right? - [chuckles] Uh, low-fat latte with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Very good. I’ll be back. Okay. Kelly. Yeah? There’s an Ingmar Bergman double feature playing tonight at the New Beverly. I’m not asking you out like a date kind of thing. I really just don’t know anyone else who might enjoy Bergman. [woman on TV] Oh, yeah! Oh, my God! [moaning] [door opens] [TV switches off] Bedroom’s this way. [chuckling] [laughs] [Todd moans] [Kelly] Oh, it feels good! [sniffles] Morning. What-- What are you doin’ up? Where’s your, uh-- [whispering] Where’s your friend? He left. Listen, about last night-- I’m your brother, and I love you, but... yeah, I can’t stay here anymore. - Uh, no offense. - You’re leaving? Yeah, I-- I gotta go. I’m sorry. No, no, no, no, no. That-- That’s okay. I understand. I wouldn’t want my lifestyle to make you uncomfortable. I’ll give you a call in a couple days and let you know where I end up. Okay, well... - good luck. - Yeah. - So, take care of yourself. - You, too. No. I mean, take care of yourself. I don’t want you getting the-- you know. Nothing to worry about. I promise. Good. I’ll, uh, catch you later. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. [door closes] [quiet chatter] Hi, Todd. Ask her out. She’s not datin’ that jerk anymore. She’s not interested. She’s available. Besides, we work together. It’d be awkward. Well, suit yourself. - Hello? - [Todd] Kelly. - Hey. - Listen. That little joke we played paid off better than I’d imagined. My brother was so freaked, he actually moved out. Can you believe it? Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty, you’re free at last. - Amen. - Well, good. I’m glad I didn’t disfigure myself for nothing. I scratched my hand climbing out your window. - Oh, I’m sorry. - Oh, I’ll pull through. Hey, listen. You wanna catch a movie tonight? I can’t pronounce it-- that German film that made such a splash at Sundance. Yes. I’ve been dying to see that. Jesus. You scared the hell out of me. I’m not staying. I just-- I forgot a couple of things. - Yeah. A couple of my things. - Oh, but I get so thirsty. Oh, the toaster? I need you to pick up Mom at the airport. She gets in around midnight. Here’s all her flight info. What are you talking about? Mom doesn’t fly. Well, she does now. I had to tell her, bro. She’s your mom. She has a right to know. Barry, you jerk! I am not gay! I was just yanking your chain. Please. You are gay. Look at you. Look at the way you dress. Look how you decorated your apartment. Look at those light bulbs. That’s a gay light bulb. - The sconces? - See? I wouldn’t know that ordinarily, but my friend is a decorator. - Oh. - It’s a girl. - Oh. - Ready to go, handsome? Oh, hello. Oh. Wow. I gotta go. Don’t forget about Mom. - Barry-- - Bye. He’s cute. Are we having toast? Ooh, whiskey. Fantastic. [laughing] It’s not funny. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just-- [laughing] - It’s not funny. - It’s hysterical. No. You don’t know my mom. I mean, when she gets an idea in her head, she’s like a Chihuahua with a chew toy. Look, once you explain, she’ll understand, and you’ll have a nice relaxing visit. The only way this is gonna be a relaxing visit is if she stays somewhere else. - I don’t suppose you have a guest room? - Uh, no. And I don’t think staying at my place is gonna convince her of your heterosexuality. Good point. It was great, wasn’t it? Brilliant. So, do we have time to grab some coffee, or do you need to go get your mom? Yeah, I should go. If I’m not there when she gets off the plane, she’ll take a cab and then spend the rest of her visit talking about how much it cost. [chuckles] Sounds like my mother. Are you sure she’s not Latina? [chuckles] I think it’s a mom thing. It transcends race, creed and color. [chuckles] Well, thanks for going out with me tonight. I had a good time. Okay, but we didn’t go out, you know. We went out. Well, we came out. We didn’t come out. We-- We physically went to the movies together. - But not together. You know, just-- - [laughs] Wow. And we almost made it through the evening without a gay panic moment. I’m sorry. In fact, I’m sorry about the whole night. I feel like I spent the entire time complaining about my mother. I don’t mind listening. That’s what friends are for. I guess I don’t have a lot of friends. Cheryl and I had couple-friends, but she seems to have gotten custody of most of them. Right. It’s hard meeting people in L.A. Well, thanks for listening. You’re a good guy. I’m a great guy. - It’s too bad it’s wasted on you. - [chuckles] Yeah? Well, I’m still trying to get over the fact that you’re not a woman. I think I was half in love with you. I mean, with the woman I thought you were. Really? You give great e-mail. Stop. You’re gonna make me cry. Okay. Time to go. [laughs] Quit being so straight. A hug is not going to kill you. Okay. Oh, that’s very nice. - Good night. - Good night... sweetie. Oh, honey! [crying] Oh, baby. Mom, I’m fine. Everything’s fine. Oh, of course you’re fine. I just wish you’d told me sooner. That’s just it. There’s nothing to tell. It was just a misunderstanding. I’m not gay. You don’t have to hide anymore. Your brother told me everything. Mom, I was just playing a joke on him. Remember? Like when we were kids? Well, I remember when I caught you with that Robert naked, and I-- I tried to tell myself nothing was going on and all little boys are curious. Nothing was going on. All little boys are curious. Yeah, well, your father warned me that I coddled you too much. - Do you think that was it? - Mom, you did not coddle me. Right, right. So it’s just genetics. That’s what everyone is saying. I mean, that no one blames the mother anymore. There’s nothing for you to be blamed for, Mom. Right, because being gay is okay. Really, nobody is to be blamed for anything. Although I do wish that your father, God rest his soul, could have turned off the television for five minutes and played with his son! Mom, you are not listening. Okay? Let’s go to the baggage carousel. I have two large bags. How long are you planning to stay? For as long as you need me, honey. Okay. All right. Mother, about this whole misunderstanding-- - [snoring] - Oh, my God. - [phone rings] - [Todd’s voice] Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn if you leave a message. [beeps] Hey, Mom. Are you there? Pick up. Okay, well, I’m gonna try to get off work early so we can talk. Honey? Todd? This is Mrs. Orsini. She has a boy like you. A programmer? You don’t have to pretend with me, Todd. Mrs. Orsini is the head of the Los Angeles PFLAG-- Parents and Friends for Lesbians and Gays. She and her husband marched in this year’s parade. We march every year. Did you march, Todd? Could you excuse us for a moment? Mother, I’d like to talk to you. What are you doing bringing her? I told you I was gonna explain everything later. I just thought it would be helpful to have someone here who’s been through it before. She hasn’t been through this before. Trust me. Todd, please don’t be upset with your mother. Now, this is a very hard time for her. She’s really trying to understand and support you. I appreciate that, and I’m sure PFLAG is a wonderful organization-- Honey, maybe I didn’t see the signs. - Maybe Cheryl turned you against women. - I have nothing against women. Ever since Cheryl, there’s been no one special in his life. He hardly dates anyone anymore. I date. I just don’t necessarily tell you about it. That’s very common among closeted men who are just coming to terms with their sexuality in mid-life. I’m not clo-- What do you mean "mid-life"? You’re 35, honey. I mean, the life span of the average American male-- All right, whatever! I am not gay, closeted or otherwise. It’s best not to force the issue. Wait till he wants to talk about it and comes to you. I am talking about it. I’m just not gay. - Feel free to come to our meetings while you’re in town. - Oh, thank you. And I will contact you with the information for your local chapter. Oh, that’s very helpful. Thank you so much, Mrs. Orsini. Oh, well, I remember how hard it was for my son and me. Good luck. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Mrs. Donovan. I just want to tell you, you have nothing to be ashamed of. My nephew’s gay. What? I said my nephew is gay. Shh! You know, you should meet him. Honey, he’s a dentist. No, thanks. Oh, right. You’re seeing somebody. Oh, well, I hope it works out. But if it doesn’t, my nephew is very sweet. Is there something I can help you with? Yeah. Uh, I’m looking for Kelly. Does he work here? He owns the place. Do you have an appointment? No, I’m, uh-- I guess I’m a friend. You guess? Could you just tell him Todd’s here? - Yeah. - Thanks. What are you doing here? [gasping] Man-scaping? Quick trim? Massage? - Brazilian wax? - You have to talk to my mother. [gasps] So soon? Are we asking for her blessing? This isn’t funny. Nothing I say seems to convince her that I’m not gay. And you think talking to me is gonna help? Maybe if you explained what happened, she’d see the whole thing was a joke. All right. Sure. I’ll try. - Really? - Yeah. Why not? Can you come by tonight after work? Well, I was going out, but-- All right. If it’s that important to you, I’ll be there. Thanks. You’re a pal. You’re welcome. [chuckles] - I’ll see you tonight. - Okay. I’m just gonna take this. Oh. Okay. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, baby. You know, that is so funny. I was just sitting here wishing there was a half-naked man in the room. You think about sex more than any woman I have ever known. - You know I’m a gay man trapped in a straight woman’s body. - [laughs] Why the mad rush? Got a hot date? I told Todd that I would help him with a little problem he’s having with his mother. Todd? Yes. Excuse me? Todd, the straight guy? Yes. - So, what, are you dating him now? - No. You know I don’t go after straight guys. - Mm-hmm. - I don’t. - Mm-hmm. - Shut up. So, what, you don’t find him the least bit attractive? I didn’t say that. And that’s beside the point. - Oh, what is the point? - The point is that I can have friends I don’t sleep with. I have you, don’t I? Yeah, you had me, remember? That was 10 years ago, and you took advantage of me. And I still let you be my friend. So my point still holds. Well, my point is that I don’t want to see you get hurt. Bonnie, I’m a big boy, okay? I’m not gonna fall for him. What do you think? Hat? No hat? I think you’re a freak. What the hell is that? - [laughs] Shut up. I love you. - Love you. - Don’t wait up. - I won’t. Don’t get drunk. [scoffs] That’s boring. Men. I’m not ready to meet your boyfriend. Mom, the whole reason he’s coming over is to establish he’s not my boyfriend. Of course, I would meet anybody that you care about. Really, I would. It’s just that... this is so new. Mom, the only new thing going on is that I have a gay friend, not a lover, a friend. Gay people are so sensitive about terminology. [ sighs] [knock at door] Whazzup, whazzup, whazzup? - How you doin’? - Okay, I think you misunderstood. We don’t need to convince her that you’re straight, just that I am. Oh, thank God. It was all too La Cage Aux Folles for me. - Oh, you must be Mrs. Mull-er. - Myoo-ler. Myoo-ler. Mull-er, Myoo-ler. - So sorry. Such a pleasure to meet you. - It’s nice to meet you, too. Well, I really can’t stay, but-- Oh, that’s so sweet. Okay. Todd wanted me to come by and explain about the other night. There’s nothing to explain. I understand. I’m an adult. Well, nothing happened. Your son was a perfect gentleman... damn it. - Kelly. - What? I’m sorry. I thought I was up to this, but I’m not. Please excuse me. Mother, wh-where are you going? I’m sorry. - [door closes] - [Todd] Mom! - Mom! - [knocking at door] Mother! You know, I just thought a little levity might lighten the mood. - [knock at door] - Mom. Oh, God. It’s not your fault. She’s a lunatic. No, no, she’s... sweet. - [pounding on door] - Mom. Mom, I’m serious. - Would you please open this door? - Let’s put a mirror in here. - Mom! - Listen, I’m going to go see... that new Woody Allen movie tonight with some friends. - Do you want to come along? - We have to see that. Friends? Yeah, friends, a group of gay men. You’d be the token heterosexual. Scared? No. But... I don’t know. Maybe I should stay here with my mom. All right, yeah. I understand. - I’ll talk to you later. - All right. Wait. She’s probably going to be in there all night. Let’s just go. This is the best you could do for straight? - I love her. - Come on. Do we have to see this Woody Allen thingy? A new Tom Cruise movie’s playing. You get to see his butt. You’ve seen that movie five times already. He’s crazy now, but I think he’s still kind of hot. - Not as hot as you, baby. - Yeah. - Todd! Is that you? - Clayton. Hi. How’re you doing? Good to see you. You remember my partner Andy. Andy! What’s up? - You’re hurting him. - Sorry, sorry. - Nice night, huh? - Oh. Oh, yeah. Um... This is my friend Kelly. Friend. And these are his friends, um, uh... - Matt and, uh-- - Anthony. - Nice to meet you guys. - Nice to meet you. So are you here to see the Tom Cruise film? Yeah, yeah-- Uh, no, Woody Allen. Yeah, Woody Allen. He shows his butt in this one. I mean, Tom Cruise does, not that I know that. I just, uh... Or care. I don’t even... Well... - have fun. - [Matt] You, too. - Bye. - Nice to meet you. Bye. He’s going to tell everyone in the office that I’m gay. - What do you care? - I don’t know. - It’s just weird. - I know what you mean. People are always thinking I’m straight. It’s so annoying. - [Kelly laughs] - What? I’m serious. It happens. - [Kelly] Yes. - Oh, my god. Sorry I’m late. I was getting my hairdo. Whatever. I just want to get tickets so we can get good seats. - I’m so hungry. - I know. Me, too. - This place is great, though. - Yeah? - [horn honks] - Fuckin’ faggots! - Asshole! - Fascist little punks! [Kelly] Are you okay? - I’m bleeding. - Oh, my God, you’re bleeding. Okay, wait. Let me see. It’s not deep. You’ll be all right. An inch lower, and you could’ve lost your eye. - Did somebody see their plates? - What for? They’re just kids. The cops won’t do anything. Now you know what we go through. Being gay isn’t all about disco music and sparkle dust. But this is your part of town. Apparently, somebody needs to be better about border patrol. God. - Is it still bleeding? - What do you think? It looks fine, but we should go inside and put some iodine on it. It’s fine. I can do it myself. [sighs] What-- - You’re still a little shaken. - I don’t want to wake my mother. Yeah, I’m a loud queen, but I do know how to whisper, you know. - It’s not necessary. - It’s going to get infected while we stand here arguing. Let’s just go inside and fix your face. It’s fine. I can do it. [whispering] Sit down. Where are the Band-Aids? - In the top drawer. - Okay. Let me see. I hope this cut didn’t ruin the evening for you. It’s not the cut. I know. We weren’t doing anything. It’s not like we were holding hands. And that would have made it okay? Well, I mean, I can see how that might make some people uncomfortable. People? Not you? Well, discomfort’s one thing, but how do you get from that to throwing bottles? People deal with discomfort in strange ways. Maybe this kid is actually gay, and this is his way of fighting those feelings. God, what a depressing thought. Well, not everybody is as accepting as your mother. Don’t remind me. I still need to straighten out that whole mess. What you need is a good night’s sleep and a hairstyle. What do you mean? I like my hair. Really? You’ve got to be completely honest with me, okay? - What? - Am I losing my hair? You are not losing your hair. - Look right there. - I’m looking right there. I see hair. - You saw hair? - I saw hair. You need a little product. No, I don’t want to gay it all up. Is gel gay, huh? A little dollop. Dollop sounds gay. It does sound gay. Hey, Todd. How was that movie last night? It was great. Yours? So-so. We did get to see Tom Cruise’s ass, so it wasn’t a total loss. Listen, you want to grab some lunch? - Oh, my God, what happened to your eye? - Uh... scratched it. It’s nothing. Oh. You want to go to that new Indian place down the street? That sounds good. Yeah. Oh, love the hair. [Indian sitar music playing] Okay, listen. There’s something I need to explain. Kelly seems really nice. How long have you been seeing him? He is nice, but we’re not dating. Oh, so you’re still in the market? Andy works with this really great guy. The two of you would hit it off. Okay, I’m not making myself clear. I am straight, heterosexual, 100%. Okay, tofu tikka masala. Can’t a guy go to the movies with a group of gay men without being gay? - Is there some sort of law against that? - Mm-mm. Of course not. Happens all the time. You still don’t believe me. It’s fine. You’ll come out when you’re ready. No, seriously, I’m straight. - Do you swear on Judy Garland’s grave? - What? Now, see that... would make perfect sense to a gay man. - [phone ringing] - [computer keys clacking] This is Todd. [Kelly] You want to get a drink after work? There’s this little place right near here makes a great mojito. You’ve had those, right? Trendy, but who cares? - It goes down easy. - Kind of like you. [laughs] Aren’t you feisty today? Don’t believe everything you read on bathroom walls. Ah, I’m glad you can laugh about your ex. I’m not quite sure I’m at that point yet. Well, I can only laugh about it because I know he’s miserable. If he was living happily ever after with that twink, I’d be a tad bitter. Yeah. So you didn’t tell me this was a gay bar. - You didn’t ask. - Do you only go to gay places? I mean, the movie theater, the coffee house. I suppose you shop at a gay supermarket. Obviously. Supermarkets are great places to pick up men. I’ll bear that in mind. - Thank you. - Thank you. Sure. You guys are a cute couple. - How long have you been together? - We’re not. - Two years. - We’re not a couple. He’s joking. Well, whatever. You look happy together. Thank you. We are. - [laughing] - Just-- - Hi, Todd! - [guffaws] I didn’t know you knew about this little watering hole. I didn’t. Kelly invited me. Yeah. We met last night. I remember. [laughs] So I just wanted to say hello. I guess I’ll leave you two alone. Judy Garland’s grave, my ass. Mom? What are you doing? Are you okay? Oh, yeah. There’s a message for you. [answering machine beeps] [Clayton] Hi, Todd. I forgot to mention, there’s a group you might be interested in. It’s called GLIPA-- Gay and Lesbian Programmers of America. I’ll e-mail you next time we have a meeting. Bye. - [beeps] - So... you’ve come out at work, but you still can’t talk to your own mother. I have not come out at work. He’s just confused. Freud called that projection. Mom, I realize this looks bad-- No, honey, not at all. There’s nothing bad about your being gay. - It’s just what you are. - But it’s not what I am. Darling, I never told this to a soul, but I knew you were gay when you were a little boy. You didn’t enjoy sports like the other boys. I liked sports. Well, let’s say you liked reading more. Mom, I was smart, not gay. Of course you were smart, and you were sensitive, and you loved the theater and music and movies. God, you’re right. I do sound gay. And when I saw you with your friend Robert, well, you know. Do you know a couple of months ago Robert came with his life partner to visit? What a lovely man. They’re so happy. They’ve been together 10 years now. Isn’t that wonderful? Yes, that’s wonderful for them, but not me because I love women. Of course you love women. It’s just a myth that gay men hate women. But that’s not what this is about. I’ve been doing some reading, a book called Loving Someone Gay. Mom... I love you so much, and I know you love me and you mean well, and you’re so sweet and supportive. And if I were gay, I’d be so lucky to have someone like you, but I’m not. And I don’t know what else I can say or do to convince you that I’m straight. This was just a huge misunderstanding. I was just trying to get back at Barry. Oh, well, Barry’s a little uptight. You know, he’ll come around. He’s a good boy. [dance music playing] Another one, please. Thank you. I’m just going to throw this out there. Are you alone? Yeah. That sucked. Hey. Me? Hi. - You got one. - [laughs] Why don’t I just pull this off? [woman moaning] It’s okay. It sometimes happens to older guys. I need to go. Well... maybe... maybe you could try that Viagra stuff. I really need to go. [sighs] Bye. [knock at door] [pounding on door] Who the hell are you, and why are you pounding on my door at 3:00 A.M.? - I was looking for Kelly. I thought-- - He’s not here. You have the right place. He’s just not here. Oh. Doesn’t mean he’s out with another guy. It’s fine if he is. That’s not-- We’re not-- [locks clanking] You’re Todd, the straight guy. Uh, yeah. I guess that would be me. Oh, hi. I’m Bonnie, Kelly’s fag-hag. - Hi. - Hi. You wanna come in? I’d better go. It’s late. Well, I’m already up. You might as well come on in. But I don’t even know you. And you never will standing out there. Come on. Thirsty? Uh...sure. So, Todd, what is this all about? You can’t tell me you were just in the neighborhood at 3:00 A.M. Um, I just need to talk to Kelly. About? It’s between us. [giggles] Kelly tells me everything. We’ve been best friends for years now. Hey, is this about your mother? You know about my mother? Just the broad outlines. Kelly says she’s really sweet. In a demented sort of way. Well, at least she’s not a bitch. You should meet mine. So you and Kelly live here together? Mm-hmm. We have for a couple of years now. He never mentioned you. You know, I think he’s been keeping us apart, probably afraid that we’re gonna end up sleeping together, and then, you know, things will get a little awkward. You pretty much say whatever pops into your head, don’t you? Pretty much. Does that bother you? I’m not sure yet. You know, Kelly is right. [rings] You are really cute. [giggles] I’m not gay. Well, nobody said you were. Everyone says I am, but I’m not. Well, makes no difference to me. Some of the best sex I’ve ever had has been with gay men. - What? - Mm-hmm. How do you think Kelly and I met? Maybe I’m still asleep and hallucinating this whole conversation. Maybe. Chamomile? We’re gonna fuck, aren’t we? - Ah! - Oh, oh, my gosh! I’m so sorry! Here, let me get something cold. Oh, that was bad. I’m so sorry! Oh... is that better? - Yeah. - Okay. Because sometimes I say things to shock people, and it’s fun, but I need to learn not to do it when they’re holding sharp objects or scalding liquids. So you were just trying to shock me? No, no, I really do wanna have sex with you. It’s just, in retrospect, maybe I could have had a more subtle way of signaling my interest, huh? Perhaps. Yeah. You’re probably not much in the mood now, huh? Yeah. I better go. I... have to get up for work in three hours. You want me to leave Kelly a message? No. I’ll catch him later. - [groans] - [door closes] [car engine starts] Bonnie? What? Did I hear someone leave? [giggles] You don’t usually let your tricks slam the door. That’s because it wasn’t one of my tricks. - It was one of yours. - What? My tricks don’t leave. It was Todd. My Todd? Mm-hmm. Why didn’t you come get me? Because it is 3:00 in the morning. And... well, because he’s really cute. Yeah. He is, isn’t he? And you know he’s straight, right? Yes. Of course. Totally. Okay. - Good night. - Night. ♪ Am I foolin’ you ♪ ♪ Are you foolin’ me ♪ ♪ Can you see in my eyes ♪ ♪ What you want to see ♪ Hey, Todd. Didn’t mean to scare you. Not that you don’t deserve it. What? All this time, you’ve been holding out on us. What are you talking about, Melissa? It’s okay. You don’t have to hide anymore. Clayton told us everything. Oh, yeah. I guess that was inevitable. I’m just hurt that you didn’t think that I would understand. I mean, I may be straight, but I’m not narrow. No, it wasn’t that-- Listen, if you’d like to, uh, get together sometime-- Diana, hi! Todd, if you have a minute, I would love to see you in my office. Of course. By the way, happy birthday. I want you to know that this company is behind you 100%. Thanks. But... this isn’t even a milestone birthday. Oh, anybody can have a birthday. But a committed gay relationship? That’s a political statement. That’s worth celebrating. What? This company recognizes domestic partnerships. I mean, that’s presuming you and your partner want to take that step sometime. This is unbelievable. Doesn’t anyone around here have anything better to do than talk about my personal life? This is a family here, Todd. That’s the only kind of company I like to run. That’s great, but-- Todd, we’re excited for you. I mean, coming out at this age? That’s not an easy thing to do, especially not in this political climate. That’s why it’s so important. Now, if you need any help from me, you just go to my assistant, and she’ll let me know. That’s very thoughtful, but-- Anyway, I think we should get back to work, don’t you? - We all have deadlines. - Yes, absolutely. But the-- the thing is, Diana, I’m not-- I don’t think you understand-- Scott-- Oh, I’m sorry. I mean Todd. You can call me Scott. I am so looking forward to meeting your partner at the company picnic next month. I hear he’s a stud! No, he-- he’s-- That’s the thing I wanna make clear. - He’s not my partner. - Oh, uh, Todd. Would you do me a favor? I would like you to look into the Nordlinger account. Just e-mail me an update. That would be great. Absolutely. I will do that. - You have a good day. - You, too. The thing is-- he’s not-- I wanna just be-- Oh, hi! I’m so glad I ran into you. I need your advice. About what? I have a few questions about, you know, backdoor issues? We’re on the fifth floor. No, no, no, no, no, silly. The back door. Back door? Carl and I have been experimenting, and it’s really working out great. At first when he suggested it, I thought, "Oh, no, he’s gay!" But that’s not what it’s all about. It’s totally perked up our sex life. Um... So we’re just using regular lotion. But I know that there’s a million products out on the market. What do you think of the stuff that heats up? Is it hot, or is it just hot? I’m not gay, and I have no expertise in this area. Well, maybe you could ask your boyfriend and get back to me. I kinda want to surprise Carl this weekend with something fun. Thanks! You’re such a doll! Okay, bye-bye. - [knocks] - It’s only me. Sorry I’m late. Hi, honey. Hi. Happy birthday. Thanks. Darling, here’s your dinner. I invited your brother. I hope that’s okay. That’s actually perfect. And here’s some butter for you all. You know, my doctor says I shouldn’t have saturated fat. But if you all want... Mom, Mom, it’s fine. Everything looks perfect. Why don’t you sit down? I sure missed your home cooking. Me, too, Mom. I’m sorry I haven’t been around more. Oh, don’t be silly. I arrived in town unexpectedly, and you’re starting a new relationship. And I may be old, but I remember how exciting that was. Can the three of us talk as adults? Sure, honey. Well, as long as you don’t get too... graphic. Look, um, I’m sorry if I haven’t been very open about my personal life. I guess I’m a pretty private person. And I can see how you might misinterpret that and think that I had something to hide. It’s okay. I understand it now. Mom, please, let me finish. The truth is, I don’t have any exciting secrets. I mean, up until recently, the most titillating thing in my life was cable television. And I guess that’s why I fell for it when Barry took an uncharacteristic interest and seemed to be trying to fix me up-- Hold on. Are you saying this is my fault? Are you blaming me? That’s not what I’m saying, Barry. [doorbell rings] I’ll get it. - He’s blaming me. - Barry. He’s a homo, and he’s blaming me. I’m not blaming you, Barry. Will you shut up? Who is it, darling? It’s the police. Oh, shit. Mr. Muller? Yeah... I have something for you. [dance music] ♪ Come on, everybody ♪ ♪ Par-tay ♪ ♪ Get into the groove ♪ ♪ Make your body move ♪ ♪ Baby, if you want me ♪ ♪ Oh, whoa, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Come on, everybody ♪ Happy birthday, big boy, from all your friends at the office. Um... I gotta go. Barry, sit down and eat your dinner. ♪ Whoa ♪ Uh, I kinda lost my appetite, Mom. ♪ Par-tay ♪ Aren’t you gonna tip the nice young man? What? That was very nice. Thank you. Hey, here’s my card. Gimme a call. I do all sorts of occasions. [Mrs. Muller] Bye. Well... I just saw you kiss a man, and I’m okay, I’m really okay. Aren’t I progressing? I’m progressing, right? Christ, this has gotten so out of hand. [knock at door] - Hey! - We need to talk. What’s wrong? I think, just for right now, we shouldn’t see each other for a while. Thought you actually had to date someone before he could break up with you. We are not breaking up, because we were never a couple. I think we should just back off a little bit. That’s such a break-up line. Oh, my God, you’re right. Okay, climb off the ledge. What’s going on? What’s going on? Tonight a man with bigger tits than my ex-wife did some sort of birthday striptease-- Happy birthday! - And then kissed me! - How old are you? Forget about my birthday. He kissed me! Look, as life catastrophes go, an unwanted kiss isn’t up there with, say, cancer, or-- Okay, so my problems don’t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Fine. They’re still my problems, and my life still feels totally screwed up! Okay, what’s the real issue here, huh? You don’t like people thinking you’re gay when we’re not doing anything? - Exactly! - Well, that’s easy to fix. Kelly! What? I just think it’s a shame that the only action going on is in the minds of your friends and family. But sleeping together isn’t gonna solve anything. What is that? Oh, night firming cream. It’s my own special blend. I sell it at the store. You want some? No, I don’t need night firming cream right now. Actually, you do. Anyway, look. You already have the stigma of being gay. You might as well experience some of the fun. But it wouldn’t be fun because I’m not into guys. You’re telling me you didn’t enjoy any of the fooling around you did when you were 12? 11, and that’s not the point. At that age, brushing against a tree is exciting. I guarantee I’m more fun than a tree. The answer is still no. Um, can you stir this? And don’t stop. - Just keep stirring. - Yes, yes, yes! The only reason why you’re not willing to have a little fun with me is because of what it might mean about you. Kelly, I’m not attracted to you. Really? Stir. I mean, not in that way. It just-- I love spending time with you, but that’s not the same thing. How do you know? Not stirring. Apples and oranges. You’ve never heard the theory that we’re all a little bit bisexual? Yes, and maybe it’s even true, but-- What are you doing? You-- You’re crazy. I’m outta here. [door slams] Orange. [door opens] Hi, Todd. How have you been? What are you doing here? Barry called me. Yeah, he had some very interesting questions about our sex life. I am going to kill him. He thinks I turned you gay! Is that true, Todd? Are you gay now? It’s none of your damn business if I’m sleeping with sheep. I’d like you to leave. I asked her to leave, but she insisted on speaking with you. We’ve spoken. Now go. I don’t believe it. Even if you were a fag, I don’t think you’d have the guts to do anything about it. [knock at door] Hey-- See? Nothing. Well, hello to you, too. I didn’t find that the least bit arousing. Well, neither did I. It felt like you were trying to bash my teeth in. - Oh, sorry. - Do you wanna come in? I think we’ve given the neighbors enough thrills for one evening. What the hell’s going on? What if I’m just fooling myself? I mean, everyone thinks I’m gay. Maybe I’m just in denial. - You’re not gay. - Can you tell? I mean, how can you be sure? Do I set off your gaydar? I’m sure because you’re sure. But, I-- I’m not sure! I mean, I was sure. I don’t know anymore! Even my own mother thinks I’m a closet case! Well, your mother has issues. Tell me about it. I can only think of one way to settle this. Oh, no. No, no, no. You’re not gonna make me listen to Barbra Streisand, are you? I can’t believe you just said that. That is such a stereotype. Okay, you know what? She’s the world’s greatest living singer and criminally underrated as a director. And Yentl was the only decent movie musical of the-- I see your point. What were we talking about? The one sure way to know whether or not I’m gay. Right. We have sex. And that’s gonna prove that I’m straight? Well, then you’ll know. I mean, it’ll either be the most incredible experience of your life or it won’t. What if you’re just a bad lay? No. Okay. So... we have sex... Mm-hmm. And if it doesn’t send me over the moon, then I’m straight? Pretty much. What if I do like it? Well, then, you’ve lucked into a pretty amazing boyfriend, if I do say so myself. I-- I don’t think I’m broad-minded enough to go through with this. Well, you’ve already kissed me, and you didn’t turn to stone or drop dead from a heart attack. But it wasn’t much of a kiss, as you already pointed out. All right. Well... Let’s start with that. What are you so afraid of? Hmm? There. That was a real kiss. That wasn’t... gross. [laughs] High praise, indeed. I mean, I thought I’d wanna throw up... but I don’t. Okay, stop. You’re making me blush. I-- I need a drink. Yeah. So do I. [chuckles] I can’t believe I might actually do this. What if it’s a mistake? Finding out who you are is never a mistake. Do you trust me? ’Cause I trust you. I really care about you. If we do this, and I don’t like it, you have to promise me that you won’t fall in love with me. [laughs] Listen to you. Look, if it’s one thing gay men are good at, it’s sex that’s only about sex. That and decorating. [laughs] Well, your sense of humor’s coming back. That’s a good sign. Shall we? [moans] Was that a good moan or a bad moan? It was good. It felt good. If I do something you don’t like, you tell me. You’re talking too much. Right. Okay. Can-- Can we turn the lights out? Yeah. Whatever you want. [whispers] You have chest hair. [laughs] Is that a bad thing? It’s definitely different. [rustling] [Todd] Ow. [Kelly] Sorry. You could put an eye out with that thing. [laughing] How much of that bottle have you had? Enough, I guess. Mmm. Morning. I have to go. I knew you’d freak out. I’m not freaking out. I just have to... go to work. Was I that good? Can we not talk about this? Look, if it makes you feel any better, in Latin America, guys aren’t considered gay for having sex with other guys, if they’re on top. Well, that’s a relief. So I’m straight as long as I move to Ecuador. Look, you can be straight here if that’s who you really are. I’ll call you. What are you doing up so early? Oh, I couldn’t sleep. A lot on my mind. Join the club. You all right, honey? I don’t wanna talk about it. [inhaling] I love that scent that Kelly wears. What’s it called? What’s the scent that Kelly wears-- How the hell should I know? Eternity. Fag Forever. Something like that. You and Kelly had a fight? Mom! No! Oh, honey, there’s this thing called couples counseling. Your father and I did it. Mom, we are not a c-- You and Dad? Yeah. It was in the ’70s. We learned a lot about communication. I really think it would be good for you and Kelly. Mother, listen to me. I don’t know how many times, in how many ways, I can say this. He is not my boyfriend! Well, whatever he is, you care a lot about him. He’s nothing to me! Look, I may not have a genius IQ, but I’m not a moron. Don’t bullshit me! I need to get ready for work, Mother. You want breakfast? [door slams] [woman] Ask him about the stripper. Hey, Todd, how’s it going? Hey. Did you enjoy the birthday gift we got you? The whole office chipped in. Clayton... Look, are you and Kelly gonna be at the Happy Hour tonight? There is no me and Kelly, okay? And I’m not gonna be a Happy Hour tonight, or ever. I’m not gay! Whatever. Todd had a little spat with his boyfriend. Oh, so is that why you weren’t at the meeting? There is no boyfriend, and there was no spat. What meeting? Project meeting. Been scheduled for a week. Oh, my God, I forgot. Hey, are you okay? You don’t look so good. I’m fine. Some of us girls are going out for drinks after work. Come along. We’ll cheer you up. I appreciate that-- I won’t take no for an answer. Party. [woman] You’re not gonna be there, dragging my ass down! [woman #2] Finally! Did you kick him out? Not exactly. He has nowhere to go, okay? But I told him he’s gotta be out by the end of the month. Ann, you’re crazy. Now you’re never gonna get rid of him. Tell him you’re gay-- surefire way to get rid of unwanted houseguests. No, that’s not gonna work because men get all turned on by lesbians. Well, men-- Okay, they think they want two women. Oh, please. Do the math. Five minutes divided by two? Not even worth shaving your legs for. [woman #2] Exactly. I just think it’s really weird that men want to watch that. Like, I don’t know. I just-- I don’t get it. I totally get it. Haven’t you guys ever seen two men having sex? [woman #2] No. Why would I see that? It’s hot. Okay, you are officially a freak. Girls, come on, back me up! No, I’m sorry. I’m with Sarah on this one. I just think it’s disgustingly, ugh, gross. I mean, sorry, no offense. None taken. I feel the same way. [woman #3] What, do you rent gay porn? No, no, no, I--I-- I’m just saying that with the right two guys, it’s really sexy. I would just settle for one man if he knew what he was doing. Thank you. - Can I get an amen? - Amen. [Ann] Angelo, he couldn’t even find my g-spot if he had a flashlight and a map. I’ve completely given up on having orgasms during sex. If my shower massage had a dental plan, I’d fucking marry it! [laughing] I didn’t realize... I just didn’t realize girls talked like this. [woman #2] Like what? What are we supposed to talk about? You know... - Love... - Love... - relationships. - relationships. Oh, such a pretty story. We talk about that shit, too. Yeah. Todd’s having trouble with his boyfriend. Oh. Is that fucking asshole cheating on you? Kelly’s not like that. And he’s not my boyfriend, you know? Last night was the first time I’ve ever had sex with a man. [woman #3] Oh...hey. Oh! Oh, my God. It’s okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I’ll see you guys bright and early tomorrow morning. I’m not going to work tomorrow. Uh... I don’t think you should be alone right now. Come with me. [Melissa laughing] This is amazing. You didn’t know it could be like this with a woman, huh? I never expected this to happen between us. I never realized you were interested in me. Well, I never knew the real you. What do you-- What do you mean, the real me? Oh! Well, I thought you were just another boring straight guy. You mean you weren’t interested in me because you thought I was straight? Well, I never realized how complex you were. So because I slept with a man, suddenly I’m complex? Well, yeah! Wait a minute. You’re not interested in me at all, are you? I’m just a challenge. Of course I’m interested in you. No. No. We wouldn’t even be here if you didn’t think I was gay. Look, do you wanna fuck or not? Of course I do, because I’m a straight man and I’ve been lusting after you from the first time I saw you. I think you better go. But-- [beep] Uh, hi. It’s Kelly. You didn’t pick up at work, so I thought I’d try you here. Just thought I’d make sure you’re okay. Call me. Maybe you should call. Maybe you should just mind your own damn business! I did not bring you up to speak to me like that. I’m sorry. I’m just a little on edge right now. Well, honey, you hungry? Let me make you some chicken. - Mom, I’m not hungry. - Chicken parmesan? [knocking] Hello! Oh, Mom. I’m so glad you’re still here, because I have to say something to the both of you. I should say so. We’ve both been waiting for your apology. Mom... I’m gay! Yeah, I finally realized I’m gay, just like him. That’s why this whole thing has been bothering me so much. [chuckling] You just can’t stand to let your brother be the center of attention, can you? I remember on his tenth birthday, you deliberately crashed your bike so that we would have to get you to the emergency room, and Todd’s party was ruined! My bicycle? No, no, that was an accident. Darling, I am so sorry if I’ve neglected you. But your brother needs me right now. [shouting] Ma, did you hear what I said? I’m gay! You are not gay! Yes, I am! I’m gay! But I’ve been suppressing it all these years, mindlessly, aimlessly fucking as many different women as I can, hoping that it would somehow change me. But it’s no use. I am what I am. How dare you say the F-word in front of your mother! Are you listening to me? I had an epiphany! And I don’t have to fight it anymore because I’m gay! I’m gay, I’m gay, just like my brother Todd. I’m not gay. Oh, yes, you are. You are gay, my little brother, and you’re very, very good at it. - You’re gay, and I’m gay. - I am not gay! Why can’t we just be gay together? There’ll be no together with the gay! Shut up, both of you! You’re my boys. I know my boys. Barry, you are not gay, and that’s that. But, Ma, no fair! I am gonna go lie down. You boys are putting me into an early grave. But how come he gets to be... all gay all the time? [door slams] You believe me? Yes. Okay! We got one sane person in this whole family. So, what do you say you, uh, hook a brother up with any of your hot gay friends? Okay, I support you, I accept you unconditionally. I’ll even march with you in Gay Pride. But, Barry, please, don’t ask me to pimp for you. All right. Fine. Just trying to get a little love. Jesus, is that so wrong? What do you got to eat? You exhaust me. ♪ Sometimes at night ♪ ♪ Where angels fly and devils play ♪ ♪ It feels so right ♪ ♪ And I don’t know what to say ♪ ♪ I’ll admit ♪ ♪ I was not pure of heart ♪ [telephone rings] [ringing] Todd? Are you all right? What? You look terrible. What’s going on? I’m fine. Everything’s fine. I-- - Look, just come with me. - Why? Just get up, walk this way. You’re in Clayton’s hands. You, out. - What? - Now! No! Take the fashion disaster with you. All right. Come and sit down. Right over here, honey. There you go. And tell me everything. Go on. I’m unshockable. I... I... had sex with a man. You cheated on Kelly? No. It was with Kelly. I mean, I had sex with Kelly. I mean, my first time ever with a man. And it didn’t work out. Oh, honey. Sometimes the first time is painful. - You have to learn to relax. - It’s not that. It’s just... I’m not gay. I’m just... not. Oh. Seems like you have the whole thing figured out. Why so miserable? I don’t know. I can’t eat. I can’t concentrate. My whole life just feels off. I’m no shrink, but it sounds like you have some unresolved issues. I know you think I’m gay. So does my mother, my brother, pretty much everyone I know. Look, in my experience, sexual identity is not decided by the masses. Right. So I’m still straight, no matter what people think. Well, there’s still this matter of sex with Kelly. It was an experiment to prove I was straight. Did it work? Yes. I mean, I don’t feel any different. I’m still attracted to women, and I’m still not attracted to men. But you were able to have sex with one. Yes. After a few drinks. Yes. Do you know what that makes you? What? Normal. How do you figure? My grandmother always had a saying. "A stiff prick has no conscience." Your grandmother? Yeah, we’re all able to get off in a variety of ways. And our sexuality, our deepest feelings about another human being-- that’s in our hearts and our minds... not our jolly Rogers. Let’s say I buy that. Why do I still feel so lousy? Oh, can’t eat, can’t sleep. Sounds like love to me. I thought that we just established that I’m not gay. There are all kinds of love. Not all of them have to do with sex. Now, look. I don’t think we’re gonna feel better until we talk to him. I mean, you talk to him. Hi. Ow! What was that for? For not calling. We just had tea. Not me, you idiot. Kelly. Oh, well, that’s what I came to explain. He’s not home yet. Is he furious with me? What do you think? He didn’t keep his promise, did he? What promise? Not to fall in love. Oh, you know what? Don’t flatter yourself, Casanova. He just doesn’t appreciate being used. It wasn’t like that. Oh, really? Well, what was it like? Hi. Hi. Hi. Well, this is a surprise. I didn’t figure I’d ever see you again. I’m sorry for not calling. I... just needed some time to sort things out. Hmm. So what’s the verdict? Did I rock your world, or did you have to close your eyes and think of England? Could we talk inside? Alone? I’ll gong you if I need you. I’ll be out here hoeing. [laughs] Okay. Well? Well, on a purely technical level, you get high marks. But... I can’t explain it. And I don’t want to hurt your feelings. It’s just... on some level I didn’t feel... engaged. That’s because you’re straight. Really? You think so? Absolutely. So... have I totally screwed up our friendship? Well, the bitchy queen in me wants to punish you. But... But I missed you. Yeah. Me, too. So where does that leave us? I mean, how can we be friends if we can’t even look each other in the eye? Truthfully, this is hard for me. I-- You’ve seen a side of me nobody else has ever seen. And part of you wants to forget that side exists and forget me, too. Yes. Is that really what you want? I don’t know. Well, then, so why did you come here? I couldn’t leave things like they were. I had to explain. I had to... make sure you were okay. I’m fine. But I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a part of me hoping that you’d discover your inner faggot, and we’d... live happily ever after. But I-- I knew that wasn’t gonna happen. Really, I did. You know, maybe you should go. I’m so sorry. I screwed everything up. No, no. I think on this one, you had some help. Should I call you... I-- Look, I don’t know. Just-- Just go. [sobbing] [Mrs. Muller] Okay, hurry, hurry. Help! I gotcha. Come on. Yeah, get those-- get those bags. [man] Good afternoon. You don’t want to let her miss this flight. She misses the flight, she stays another night. I love ya, Ma! - Me, too. - Watch the spikes. Oh, okay. Love you! Okay, Todd, now, now, it’s not that heavy. It’s just a few dresses. - Hi. - Hey. - Oh...Tom. - Tom. Nice to meet you. - It was good to see you. - I love you. And maybe next time I come, maybe there’s grandkids. - What? - Well, I mean, no rush. You and Kelly take your time, of course. Mom, do I need to give you a birds and bees talk now? Don’t play dumb with me. Look, there’s adoption, surrogacy, the gay-by boom. I know all about that. Mom, you know Kelly and I are not a couple. What, this whole visit you’re trying to tell me there’s nothing going on between you and Kelly? I don’t think so! I’m just waiting for you to stand up and say, "I’m gay, and I’m proud of it." I’m gay. I’m proud of it. Todd’s just confused. Honey, let it go. You are not gay. Oh, I am gay, I am so gay, I even got my nipples pierced. Look, let me show you, look-- - No, not here! - See, it’s got a tight little clamp. You do not have to be gay. It’s not a competition. I love you as much as I love your brother. Mom, you should go. I love you. Okay. Bye, honey. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. - Safe trip. - Let’s go. I’d love the kids’ names to be Rosie and Henry. Okay. Happy Hour? I wasn’t sure you’d come. [laughs] Yeah, neither was I. I’m glad you did. I ordered your favorite. Thank you. My mom thinks we should adopt a kid. [laughs, coughs] Oh... Well, I’ve always wanted children. You’d be a great dad. Thanks. You, too. So is this okay with you? It’s a little sweet. Not the lattes, fool. The two of us. It’s not gonna be too weird between us? Weird, yes. Too weird? My boundaries on that have been expanding. What about you? I’m okay... now. I guess I let my feelings get a little out of control. Feelings have a way of doing that. But I’m over it. You won’t have to deal with any more hysterical crying jags. I wasn’t worried. Well, I was... for a while. I’m not going to be doing any of that "Scarlett pining for Ashley" crap. In fact, I already have a new personal ad posted on the Internet. You should check it out. And this time, I posted a picture. Smart move. You should do it, too. No, I’ve already met someone I’m interested in. Oh, really? Someone at work? No. Someone at your apartment. Oh, my God. How weird. - You’re right, forget it. - No, no. It’s not that. It’s... I was gonna ask Barry out. My brother? Well, he is cute. And I already know he comes from a good family. We can double-date. It would be a hoot. You think my coworkers are confused now? Are you still trying to convince them that you’re straight? No, I gave up. I mean, really, who cares? Besides, technically, I’m bisexual, right? Uh, no. You’re straight. If you were bisexual, you never would have resisted my charms. Listen to you. Hey, I’m a hot package. You’d have been lucky to have me. I know.
