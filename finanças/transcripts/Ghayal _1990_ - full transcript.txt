After considering all the circumstances and statements this court considers accused Ajay Mehra as guilty under section 302 of the IPC and sentences him to life imprisonment. The breads are getting smaller and the curry is getting watery! "The curry is getting watery!" Hey! -The food is disgusting. -That's true. Berry! He's been here for quite some time, but he doesn't talk to anybody. His silence says a lot. Was it a nightmare? It is reality. We're familiar with that reality, Ajay. Our crimes are based on the same reality that you just described. He is Mitwa. I found myself on the footpath and... grew up hearing people's abuses. After committing thirteen half murders in twenty years I killed two or three people. What wrong did I do? What do you say? Vardha... Vardha Rajan. I came from Madras... carrying the burden of humanity, hard work and honesty. The city of Mumbai took it all away and handed over a pistol a gun and a knife to me so that I could kill people. Rajan Berry. I never thought that the hands that accepted a master's degree would end up robbing and murdering one day. But I did that. We have our own issues, my friend. But we need to compromise. Gradually, these fingers will learn to hold these iron rods. These walls, this roof... and the ventilator which shows us sympathy, will make you forget the past... which has brought you here. How can I forget the past? No. I can't forget it. Everything was all right. Darling I take your oath I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you Darling I am yours What is life without you? What is life without you? You are my heart You are my life I will always be where you are You are my heart You are my life I will always be where you are Darling I take your oath I don't want to live without you What is life without you? I was born for you Since I met you I have become a stranger to myself We have been meeting like this For many lifetimes The two of us are Reflections of the same body Where could I go leaving The comfort of your love? I don't want to live without you What is life without you? Darling I take your oath I don't want to live without you What is life without you? Your face is entrenched in my eyes My fate is secured to your scarf Your love is ensconced in my breath My life is beautiful because of your love Both my worlds are Drenched in your colors What is life without you? What is life without you? You are my heart You are my life I will always be where you are You are my heart You are my life I will always be where you are -Darling -My beloved -I take your oath -I take your oath -I don't want to live without you -I don't want to live without you -I don't want to live without you -I don't want to live without you Varsha, your house is here. Varsha, your house is here. Today, I'll go to my home. What do you mean? It's clear. A girl's real home is her beloved's home. Sure, but after the wedding. -When will we get married? -Very soon. I'm waiting for our country's problems to be solved. What about our children? Their future? Their careers? Ajay, you make a joke out of everything. Be serious. You have everything. A brother, a sister-in-law. I've become lonely after my parents passed away. And you are just... Varsha, I understand. My brother is very short-tempered. I'll take the help of my sister-in-law. I'll talk to her tomorrow. You've been using these tactics for quite some time. I'm going to go and talk to them myself-- No, Varsha, don't do that. My sister-in-law needs a beautiful, simple and a shy girl. Beautiful, simple and shy. That's what I am. -Yes, you are. -So, let's go and talk to them. It's not that easy, I need time. I give you 24 hours. -What can I do in one day? -20 hours. -Okay, how about 24 hours? -18 hours! -That's not fair... -15 hours. 13 hours... I can't see you working alone anymore. Let me help you. What are you doing? You work so much. You need someone to help you. I've spoken to Kantabai. She'll start helping me tomorrow. Kantabai? No, not her! We need someone who can help you like a family member. I hope you understand. Yes. You love somebody. You're afraid to say it to your brother and want me to say it to him. Right? Your brain is as beautiful as your face. You're great, sister-in-law. -I understood. -Great! -How does she look? -Who? -The girl. -Well... She's beautiful, sister-in-law. Very beautiful. Nothing in comparison to you. Not even close to you. But she is okay. Anyways, I'm not asking her for myself. I need someone who can help you. I understood everything. I'll talk to your brother. -Then let us go, sister-in-law. -Now? The elders have said, "Never postpone until tomorrow what you can do today." Wait! So, the young lad is in love? And he wants to marry? It will be good. -Do you want this? -Yes. That's obvious. -Where is he now? -He's here. Should I call him? Ajay? Call him lovingly. Ajay. Didn't hear you? Ajay! Did you call me, brother? I've been told that you've grown up. Okay. You're in love with someone and you want to get married. No, brother, sister-in-law wanted-- I mean, sister-in-law was saying-- What? She was telling me that she needs someone to help her. I suggested a maid, but she told me that hiring a maid would be a bad idea. She wants someone close and asked me to get married. -She wants a daughter-in-law. -Daughter-in-law? -But I said, "I enjoy my freedom." -Well said! But she isn't willing to agree. I said, "How can Laxman do such a thing without Ram's permission?" Mrs. Sita! And Mr. Laxman. Stop your Ramayana. Listen carefully to what I have to say. -What were you saying? -About love, brother. Remove the craze of love from your mind. I did. Look, he has to become a boxing champion. You have to win a gold medal. Don't get married. -Yes. -Stop scolding him. He hasn't committed a sin. Maybe he has. -What had you done? -What had I done? You used to tease me by blowing the horn in the middle of night. Brother, did you really do that in the middle of the night? I come home early, sister-in-law. And because of this craze, your brother was arrested once. No... What are you talking about? -You went to jail? -She is lying. Lying? Gupta uncle got him released. And then he had said, "My dear I can get crucified for you!" -Really, brother? -No way. -Didn't I get crucified by marrying you? -What? -That is why I don't want him to-- -Get crucified. Well... I don't know anything. I want him to get married. Yes. He'll become a boxing champion. -I want him to get married. -He'll be a boxing champion. I want him to get married. I want him to become a boxing champion. -I want him to get married. -He has the potential. -I want him to get married. -He'll become a boxing champion. -I want him to get married. -He'll get into heavy-weight training. -I want him to get married. -He'll become a boxing champion. -Boxing champion. -I want him to get married. What's going on, Ashok? I'm glad you are here, uncle. Now you can help us decide. -This is my niece's house. -Yes. And here, I'm not barrister Gupta. I'm Uncle Gupta. Do you understand? -How are you, Indu? -I'm fine, uncle. Yes, Ajay. How is your practice? -Exactly! -What? -Practice? He is actively practicing. -Very good. -He is not practicing boxing. -Why? He is practicing love. Like Mughal-e-Azam. And your niece is supporting him. -Look. -What does it mean, Indu? My Lord, may he be granted permission. Because every successful man needs the support of a woman. And that woman in Ajay's life is his beloved. Ashok, she is right. I think we should meet the girl. -What are you saying, uncle? -Yes. -Let it be, uncle. -But I'm talking in your favor. I'll sacrifice my love for the dreams of my brother. -Oh, Devdas, stop this drama. -He's pretending. Enough of your acting. Stop this drama. I want to see the angel who made my brother go crazy. -So, are you ready? -What? -Really? -Yes. -Absolutely? -Absolutely. -Really? -Really. Let's shake hands. Thank you, sister-in-law. Thank you, brother. He called you brother and he called me sister-in-law. He will definitely get married today. What happened? Did brother and sister-in-law agree? What happened? -In the movie Mughal-e-Azam. -Mughal-e-Azam? Yes. Brother got angry when he realized that I am in love. He got very angry. I snapped at him. Sister-in-law started crying. Brother took out the gun. I bared my chest. His gun, my chest. My chest, his gun. -What happened next? -His gun, my chest. Yes. Sister-in-law's tears. Uncle Gupta's wailing. I said, "I'll give my life but won't break my promise to you." -Didn't I? -Yes, yes. -Then what happened? -Firing ensued. The gun fell on the floor. They spoke... "Hey, hey." You mean, they agreed? Ajay, that's great. That's simply great! Darling, can we go for the movie then? Be serious. Have you thought about tomorrow's match? What's there to think about? -"What's there to think about?" -Yes. The match is with the university champion Tinu. Tinu! Be it Tinu or anybody else, what difference does it make to me? Ajay! Listen to me. -Listen to me. -Let me explain, sir. -My brother will kill me. -It doesn't matter. -Listen to me. -Accidentally... -Listen. -It will keep happening. -Shut up and listen to me. -Yes, sir. You've been selected for the tournament. God knows why? But... This is your order. And I will have to go with you. It will be great fun, sir. -Varsha! -Yes? -Varsha. Our wedding permit! -Yes. Tournament, championship, then, we get married. How can I explain it to you, Indu? After facing loss in the business, everybody has deserted me. Friends and relatives have exposed their true colors. I had never imagined that I'll have to do this to repay my debts. I don't know whether I can be free from debts, or not. -Why don't you explain it clearly? -What should I explain? What's going on with you? -You don't let go of anything. -Why should I? -You need to trust me. -Brother! If I don't ask-- What's the matter, brother? Sister-in-law? Nothing. What do you have in your hand? I've been selected for the tournament. I've to go to Bangalore for the training. Well done, my champion! -Did you hear that? -I heard it. What did you hear? Ajay is going to become a champion. -Let's go for an outing. -I won't! -Why won't you? We'll take you forcibly. -Yes. Brother, your sister-in-law is heavy. Hey, she's my wife. -My sister-in-law. -Oh, God! Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Don't waste today for tomorrow Today won't come tomorrow Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Whatever has to happen, will happen So, what's the use of thinking? Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Don't waste today for tomorrow Today won't come tomorrow What could be better Than the fact that we are together? What could be better Than the fact that we are together? Smile a little Sing a little This is called life What could be better Than the fact that we are together? Nobody knows When the moment of separation may come Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Don't waste today for tomorrow Today won't come tomorrow A human being is the one who Lives with a smile And sings a song all the time A human being is the one who Lives with a smile And sings a song all the time The moments of life are a gift of love What more do we want? A human being is the one who Lives with a smile And sings a song all the time For him a desert is an oasis And autumn is like spring Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Don't waste today for tomorrow Today won't come tomorrow Why worry? We'll face whatever comes our way Whatever has to happen, will happen So, what's the use of thinking? I miss you too much, Varsha. Do you miss me too? Varsha, you wrote only nine letters in response to my ten letters. Whom are you afraid of, Varsha? Afraid of the world? I'll... What the hell! I've been beaten outside the ring much more than inside it, just because of you. Oh, Lord! Getting close to him is dangerous. It must be a dream. It was a dream. -I said hello. -No, it's a dream. -Ajay. -Varsha! No! I was thinking about you. Why didn't you reply to my tenth letter? I wanted to surprise you. I was thinking about you when my coach intervened. -Coach? -Our coach. Who are you? Whom have you come to meet? -Varsha go. I don't know you. Go away. -Ajay! What? -I'll be killed. -I came to meet you. I've come all the way from Bombay only to meet you. What if you've come from so far? I don't know her. I don't know you. Is there any discipline in the gym? He brings a girl here. Okay. I'm going. Thank God, I found you. I looked for you everywhere. Excuse me, I don't know you. We've met after so many days. Let's be sweet-- Strange! Why are you whispering to me? What are you doing? Don't talk loudly. Everybody is looking at us. That baldy is staring at us. And that fatty has stopped eating and is looking here. -Who are you calling baldy and fatty? -Varsha! -Who called me baldy? -No, we didn't call you baldy. And who called me fatty? No, she calls me fatty out of love. Right, darling? You're quite slim. Please continue eating. You'll get me killed. Here! Eat up! Eat up! Varsha, that couple is so cute. And look at us. If you like a young girl romancing an older man, go and talk to them. Why are you sitting here? Who called me an old man? We are talking about our ourselves. Do you want me to get beaten up, Varsha? He touched me! -Yes. He touched me. -No, no. What's happening? Is there no decent person to save me? He's bothering me from so long and nobody is there to stop him. -What's going on? -Greetings, brother. Please sit. This is our way of a romantic conversation. Right, Varsha? -What's going on? -Nothing, she loves me. -What's going on? -Nothing, she loves me. -What's going on? -Nothing, she loves me. Please sit. Sit down, Varsha! Who are you, mister? Mother! Is this villain bothering you? I'm not a villain, Bheem. I'm her fiancÃ©. Darling, tell Bheem that you love me, please! I don't love you. -She said, she loves me. -No, I don't love you at all. Excuse me, sir, this girl is innocent. This man is double my size. Please tell him you love me. I don't love you. Would you please let me go? Varsha, please tell him you love me. I don't care, I don't love you. He needs to learn a lesson. She's very naughty. She's just kidding, she loves me very much.

Look, the pretty girl is mine now She is mine now Firstly, focus on your game. -Yes, sir... -Ajay! Hey, brother! What a pleasant surprise, brother! -Why are you in this condition? -I'm perfectly fit. -How are you? -I'm fine. Are you all right? Totally fit, brother. What's the matter, brother? Ajay, I've come to say something -very important. -Tell me. -How is sister-in-law? -She is fine. I want to say that... What's the matter? Go. I'll talk to you in the evening. -Where are you staying? -Hotel Dreamland. -Okay, we will have dinner together. -Yes, yes. Sorry, sir, Mr. Ashok Mehra checked out in the afternoon. -In the afternoon? -Yes! I'm his brother. Did he leave any message? How can he go without leaving any message? Perhaps he had some urgent work and had to leave suddenly. He wanted to say something very important. He will call you then. There's a call for you from Bombay. Is it Ajay? -I'm Ashok. -How are you, brother? You left without informing me. I want to tell you something very important. -Yes, go ahead. -Are you listening, Ajay? -I'm in great difficulty. -Difficulty? -What's the matter brother? -Ajay! -Yes, tell me! -Ajay! Yes... -He had called from here. -From Bombay? Yes. He wanted to say something but the line got disconnected. The line got disconnected? He's in Bombay and he didn't come home! There must be something serious. Sister-in-law! Ajay, I'm afraid. He has been upset for some days. He said, he is doing certain things against his will. Against his will? Why didn't you tell me all this before? He didn't tell us to keep us away from trouble. -He was suffering alone... -Don't worry. He'll come back. Maybe he's gone out for some important work? I'll find out. Everything will be alright. We'll scold him once he is back. He makes my sister-in-law weep so much. Do you have any number from there? All right. Uncle Gupta has left for Delhi for ten days. I was working there for a long time. Mr. Ashok used to be upset. I heard Ashok and Balwant Rai started some business together. I don't know much but he let me go with three month's salary. As I said, Rai is not an ordinary man. He helps people like Ashok and forgets them. I'll remind him. But for the next two months he is extremely busy. Go on. That day he was very disturbed when he had met me. Kamle, Bhosle is after me. The permission for that procession has been canceled. Damn idlers! He was disturbed. He called after two days and on the phone-- -How was the party? -Did Murari come? Yes, with his wife. She was wearing a red blouse... -Bhosle took her with him. -Really? And Rane was very jealous. -I've heard your story. -I'm not telling you a story. I'm... -I came here to file a report. -Your brother is missing. Right? File your report with Mr. Patil who handles the missing persons' squad. I have many other things to do. Come on, Anand. I know how busy you are, inspector. You're forgetting that you're here for us. You are here to help us. Is this the right way to talk to me? Sir, this is the boy who indulged in a quarrel at his college. He goes to college to create nuisance. Then, he tries to teach us the law! Make sure you remember this slap. Use these tears to flush out... our country's dirt. Such policemen should be shot in the middle of the road. -It's a good idea. -You think I'm joking? Joke? No. I was thinking, who would fire the shots. I will. They kept me waiting at the police station for two hours. They had no manners and no feeling of responsibility. Such people can't protect us! We're very safe without them. Don't be angry. Did you find anything from his place of work? He was working with Balwant Rai and I'm trying to meet him for three days. They say, he's extremely busy. Balwant Rai, owner of Rai industries? You can meet him tomorrow. Your love and respect has made me emotional. I know these children need love and sympathy, more than money. I'm ashamed because I've been unable to give them, that love and time. What more can I say? Mohile. I'm making a small contribution, to this organization. You should spend for the kids. Sir, our institution has carried out several good deeds for the orphans. -I need to meet him. -Meet him at the office. My name is Ajay Mehra, I want to talk about my brother Ashok Mehra. Ashok was working with us but for the past few months, we didn't have any dealing with him. I don't know. Did you file a report with the police? Yes, but... Yes, I know. The police are just... I'll talk to the commissioner about this. Your stuff is not as good as before. The customers are unhappy. They don't find the stuff good enough. -What is the matter, Deka? -Nothing, sir. They are talking about the stuff. Very good stuff, sir. There's a lot of demand for your stuff in Gujarat. Increase its supply over there. -What happened to Mushtak? -Sent him underground, sir. -What do you mean? -I killed him! Deka, don't talk loudly. I don't like noise. Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir. Come on. He's my elder brother Ashok Mehra. He often came here. No, he never came here. -Do you know him? -No, I don't know him. -You may have seen him somewhere. -No. Will you offer me liquor? -Will you offer me liquor? -You're talking to the wrong man. Aren't you trying to find someone? -I know him. -You know him? -Ashok Mehra. -Yes. -He's my brother. -How much money do you have? -Money? -How much money do you have? Give it to me. -How do you know my brother? -This is insufficient. I'll give you more, tell me where my brother is. Come with me. Bravo! -Have him fight with my boy. -Go away. -Take your money. Here's your money. -Let him fight my man. -He's a lion. -He's the greatest lion. If your boy wins, I'll give 40 for 10. If my boy is defeated, I'll give 300 for 10. Gentlemen, we have one more fight here. -Come on, get ready. -What is happening? -It is a game. -With me as a bet? -Stop this game, or else... -You won't get anything. Earn 40! You'll get nothing by beating me. You'll get money by beating him. -I won't fight at any cost. -Not even for your brother? Gentlemen, 10 for 40! I told you, I'll give you more money tomorrow. Who has seen tomorrow? Talk about today. Right now. We have an interesting fight here! As you wish. Come on, guys! I know you will win. You're a good boxer. I know it. Ashok told me. And I don't forget such things. Come on, guys, bet on him. Gentlemen, this is my tiger. -Put your money here. -50! Great. Bet and make money. Yes. Very good! Very good! Hit him! Hit him! Knocked out in one shot. Hey, you still owe me five... He was in a great difficulty. Those who gave him the loan were after him. To save his life, he joined us. I mean, he started working with us. But he used to work for Mr. Balwant Rai. Mr. Balwant Rai. We both worked for him. He paid Ashok's debt... and bought him. And expanded his business... in the name of Ashok's company. -What kind of business? -Business of death. Balwant Rai is a big distributor of illicit drugs. He has lakhs of goods in and around here. What are you saying? Your brother was afraid of the truth. It's enough, Balwant Rai. I want to get out of this situation. Moreover, I've paid back your debts. Take my advice, Balwant Rai. Stop all this. Take my advice, Ashok. Go on a vacation for some days. Ashok, give that box to Kamran. Mohile, ask Kamran to burn all the files and papers. Then he went out for some days. He told me he is going to meet his brother. Yes, he came to meet me. But didn't he meet you again? Yes, he met me again. One day he met me here again. -Here? -Yes. There was no other place to meet. This was our world. We were the kings of this place. I remember clearly, I was sitting here. He was sitting where you are right now. You are talking nonsense. All fingers are not alike. You don't know Ajay. My brother will definitely come. I had called him up. I'll tell him that I'm in great difficulty. He'll come running to me. Mr. Ashok, your call is connected. Look, my call is connected. I'll tell him. He'll come soon. Ajay, I'm Ashok calling from Bombay. Son! Can you hear me? I want to discuss something really important with you. I'm in great difficulty-- Deka, let him go! Tell me, where is that box? No, Balwant Rai, those papers are a proof of your crimes. People will see the real you now. Enough! If Ashok has said anything about the bag then he would be dead by now. And if he has not said anything yet, I'm sure they are torturing him right now. -Take me there. -Where? -To my brother. -I'll take-- Son of a gun! Come over here. -Let's run from here. -Who is he? -He's the owner of this bar. -You beat my brother up! Will you come down, or shall I come up? Balwant Rai's right hand. He is quite -a dangerous man. -How dare you beat my brother? He was here that day. Come down. I'll not spare you. Come on. Nobody will intervene. Everybody will watch him dying. Get back to your places. He's very hot-blooded, I'll calm him down. What is this? Four men on one side. I'm here, bro. Don't make the mistake of thinking that he is alone. I am coming... Let me go! Ajay! Aren't you afraid of the law? Is this your law? Show your courage and arrest Balwant Rai if you can. He has kidnapped my brother. Don't accuse a good man. Do you have any proof? They took that man who had the proof. Proof! You'll get the proof of his dead body. Then, you can write the report. -You'll get the official medal! -Don't act smart. Police does-- Does nothing! Throw away your uniform. And tie the belt of Balwant Rai's slavery around your neck. This is a lawless place. Showing your manhood on the poor and weak? Power of your uniform? You can put handcuffs only on these hands! Not on Balwant Rai's hands! Go and become his slave and act like his dog. They'll thrown bones at you. You are doing well, inspector. You're doing very well. You'll get a promotion and many medals. Why are you running away? Listen to me. PRISON FOR MALE. Barrister Pramod Sharan Gupta who solves everybody's problems, the one who handles problems of big companies, states and nations, isn't aware of his own family problems. Ashok is missing and nobody told me about this. -You were in Delhi, I thought-- -What did you think? Is any case more important than my kids? You could've called me. Uncle, sister-in-law told me to do so, but-- You didn't think it was necessary because you've grown up. And did you realize the implications of what you did last night, at the police station? If I wasn't here, how could she have bailed you out? -I've explained everything to you. -Indu, get me some tea. Yes. Why don't you believe me, uncle? Balwant Rai is a big smuggler. Brother is his captive. His life is in danger. -We must do something quickly. -Ajay, you're believing a drunkard you don't even know. Whereas, Ashok is always praising Balwant Rai. And he has helped Ashok many times. Help! That was a plan to trap brother. -Who are you talking about? -No, nothing. Ajay, I'm no less anxious about Ashok than you. He's like my son. I'll leave no stone unturned to find him. But don't complicate the matter in haste. I've come. Everything will be resolved. Ashok will come back soon. I've seen everybody. Nobody helps in times of need, Varsha. Uncle Gupta says, he has spoken to the commissioner. They are looking into the matter. But there's no result. This has been going on for the last one month. I don't know anything about brother's condition. Varsha, I hear his cries. He needs me. And I'm helpless. Balwant Rai. Yes, I'll see Balwant Rai right now and find out everything about brother. No, Ajay. I don't know why, but I'm afraid. I think it would be wrong to go to Balwant Rai at this time. -Talk with Gupta-- -I don't need anybody, Varsha. I'll do everything myself. Nothing will happen to me. I'll take care of myself. We're pleased to see you win this year too. That's your love, I truly don't deserve it. Mr. Balwant Rai? I want to talk to you. Chosen for the third time... -Talk to Mohile. -I want to talk to you. -What were you saying? -Now... -Come to the office tomorrow. -Not tomorrow, now. -Disturbing the party... -Where is my brother? Hasn't he returned? I had asked Mohile to call the commissioner... Before I expose you before these respectful people, tell me where my brother is. Send Hanif. Ajay, this is a misunderstanding. I know the reality. You are a criminal. No, Ajay. You don't know me yet. Those who clash with me, die a painful death. Give these threats to someone else, Balwant Rai. If my brother is hurt, I'll punish you so bad that you'll repent you were ever born. And the servants who encourage you to work, won't be seen anywhere near you. Let go! Let go off me! Scoundrel! I will drain your blood, you rascal! Balwant Rai, if my brother doesn't return by tomorrow, I'll kill you. You rascal! -Take away this drunken goon. -I won't spare you! -I'll kill you, rascal. -Such a nuisance! -It's all right! -Let me go! Let me go! Run, the police have come. Hey, where are you fleeing? Cowards! What's going on? Who were those people? They were that rascal's dogs. Behave yourself. He's the commissioner. Be polite, you're talking to the police commissioner. What's the problem? My name is Ajay. My brother has gone missing. I filed a report with the police, but nothing has been done. I found the person who had kidnapped him, but the police are not ready to do anything. Tell me, sir, what should I do? Where should I go? Who is he? What's his name? Balwant Rai. They were his men. -You're badly hurt. -These wounds won't kill me, sir. Will you help me? I'll ask ACP Bhonsle to investigate thoroughly. Investigate? This investigation has been going on for a month. My brother's life is in danger there. And you say that they'll investigate? The police have to act under certain rules and regulations. We can't act against anybody without any proof. Come on, driver. You can meet ACP Bhonsle tomorrow. This city is no longer worth living in. After your brother comes, we'll settle in some peaceful place. I spoke to Uncle Gupta. He has met the commissioner. He told me that your brother will come home soon and... we should not be worried. What should I do? Nothing? What has anybody lost? My brother is missing! Nobody will do anything. This is a city of blind and deaf people. All are like stones. And honest man can do nothing. I've been wandering like a crazy person for one month. -Who knows if he's alive, or not... -Ajay! What should I do, sister-in-law? What should I do, sister-in-law? What should I do? Sir, we've found the papers Ashok Mehra was hiding. Should I put him underground? Today, I saw your anxiousness to meet your brother. Balwant Rai? I appreciate your enthusiasm. If anything happens to my brother, I'll kill you. You can meet your brother in Central Park right now. You have a lot of enthusiasm, right? Show that enthusiasm now and go meet your brother. Brother! Ajay! Ajay! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother! Balwant Rai! You killed my brother! Balwant Rai! Is anybody listening? My brother has been killed. Is anybody listening? They killed my brother and threw him away! Is anybody listening? They killed my brother and threw him away... They killed my brother, uncle. Where are you calling from? From the Central Park telephone booth. Uncle, they killed and threw my brother away. What should I do, uncle? -Ajay. -What should I do? Hello. Don't be afraid, Ajay. -Come quickly, uncle. -Yes, I'm coming. -Uncle, come soon. -Ajay, I am coming. Yes. Stay right there. Indu? Indu, calm down. Why have they arrested Ajay? Admit that you murdered your brother. Admit that you murdered your brother. Say it! You've killed your brother. Admit it. What are you doing, Sharma? Have you gone mad? Patil, stop it. Have you gone mad? -Do you want to kill him? -He will admit. -Stop it. -Admit it. Ajay, they are very dangerous. Give us your statement. I'm with you. I'll help you in the court. You can tell me. Go, Bashir Khan, join some drama company. You'll earn a lot. You are a good actor. How about this? Bribery and cunningness have killed the humanity in you. You are hollow and useless. All of you are cowards. I feel like... But that will solve your problem. Not mine. You must die painfully within the walls of prison. And I'll have you punished. You'll repent later, inspector. You will regret leaving me alive. My Lord, the accused is wasting the court's time. When all the proofs, witnesses and investigation reports show that the accused has murdered Ashok Mehra. He's trying to put the blame on Balwant Rai to confuse us. He has insulted the law and the court. I'll bring to the podium an important witness for whom we have waited for two days. Specially, the accused, Ajay Mehra. -Permission granted. -Present Pramod Sharan Gupta. He doesn't need an introduction. He is a very prominent lawyer. He has taken law to new heights and created great examples. Mr. Gupta, tell the court what you know about this case. The victim's wife is my niece. I'm very close to this family. Ashok and Ajay used to fight often. But I'd never thought that it would result in murder. On the 7th of November, Ajay called me up saying that -he murdered Ashok. -What are you saying? I didn't believe him. But when I reached there, Ajay was holding Ashok's body-- My Lord, Ajay wanted me to save him. He is lying! He's talking nonsense. It's a conspiracy. Why don't you understand? Ajay is innocent. Whatever you want to say, you can say it from the witness box. Varsha. What are you saying, uncle? Aren't you afraid of God? Don't believe his statement. He is lying. He has been sold. Balwant Rai has lured him too. This is a conspiracy! Mr. Gupta, what's the cause of this murder? My Lord, I'm ashamed to say this. But no husband can tolerate his wife's affair with another man. Please be clear, Mr. Gupta. Ajay had an illicit affair with his sister-in-law. Gupta! I'll break your bones! Come on, get up! After considering all the circumstances and statements this court considers the accused, Ajay Mehra guilty under section 302 of the IPC and sentences him to life imprisonment. Oh, God! She is a sinner! -She looks innocent, but... -Husband's brother is like a son... She's a shameless woman. She should kill herself. Oh God, people can stoop to such a level! She should be ostracized from the society. She has no right to live. An illicit affair with her brother-in-law? Shame on her! A sister-in-law is like a mother. This is a catastrophe! Such a woman should die. She is not a woman, but a witch. She made a brother murder his own brother. Ajay had an illicit affair with his sister-in-law. Ajay had an illicit affair with his sister-in-law. She left this letter for Ajay. Ajay, I'm leaving you alone in this cruel world at such a crucial time. Forgive me. In my next life, I want you to be my son. You must repay the debt. May God protect you. We're with you, Ajay. We'll fight this battle with you. This is my battle. You can't fight this battle with sentiments. You can't fight with Balwant Rai alone. I'll fight alone. You call us your own and refuse to accept us as your own. Instead of breaking stones in jail, it's better to help you. I can't endanger someone's life for my own goal. What life and what danger? We are already in prison. We can be hanged anytime. Better run on the first opportunity. -Mitwa is right. -Yes! By killing a few people like Balwant Rai our sins will be washed away. We shall embark on a new life then. -And then we'll settle somewhere. -That's it. -Why don't you understand? -Agree with us, Ajay! We've been in this hell for five years now. Good or bad, whatever we did, we did it for ourselves. Joining your battle might give some meaning to our lives. Don't be so headstrong, Ajay. -Come on, agree with us, friend. -Yes. That's more like it. -Due to the stormy rains last night... -The outer road... It has been shut. A few vehicles have been stuck on that road. The warden has asked me to take a few prisoners to clean the road. -Let's go. -Yes. Let's get ready to leave. -Come on, Mitwa. -Yes! Come on. Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up! Faster! Come on! Hurry! Come on! All of you, get to work. Come on! You lazy man! Why aren't you working? You scoundrel! Gupte, watch the New Bombay and Vashi area. Be in touch with Katre. I need the report every ten minutes. Find more details from the jailer and get me connected to the traffic commissioner. Three of them are professional criminals. Fourth... What's his name? He was accused of murdering his brother. They injured five guards outside the jail. -That means they are armed. -They snatched two guns. -From the guards? -Yes, from the same guards. He's ACP Joe D'Souza. He will handle this case. What's the latest information? They've gone towards the Pokhran jungle in a Shaktiman truck. We have the pictures of those people. Any other detail? My brother's life is in danger there. And you say that they'll investigate? Pokhran jungle. They are near Bombay. They'll try to enter the city. We should try to catch them outside the city at any cost. Oh, ant! Oh, ant! I am a piece of jaggery Come here if you want some Or, I shall leave, sweetheart Come here if you want some Or, I shall leave, sweetheart Oh, ant! Oh, ant! I am a piece of jaggery Taste my heady flavor Since you've come my way Rascal! Are you blind? Can't you see? What did you do? You broke my wall! Hey! Come out! You? Why did you do this? Whoever loves their life, should leave this place immediately. Because in a few minutes, everything will burn down to ashes. Don't move! We are running out of bullets. Careful. Don't be afraid. I am Mitwa. No! Enough! -Eat this. -No! No! -Eat this. -I'll die. Balwant Rai's dog. This poison of yours has taken innumerable innocent lives... and destroyed innumerable families. -Eat this. -No. -Balwant Rai? -Who's that? Behind the bars, I've spent each day as if it were a year. In the next 24 hours, I'll cut you into 24 pieces and perform the last rites of each piece separately. You know the consequences of clashing with me, Ajay. Your captain Deka's dockyard where you kept your goods worth crores, has been burnt down to ashes. You'll also find the dead bodies of your stooges here in the ashes. -Ajay... -Don't worry. In the next 24 hours, I'll kill you and the others. You'll go to hell. I promise. Ajay! Try to find out. Does he have relatives? What? Ask them to keep monitoring them. Understood? Don't worry. We've made all the arrangements. They'll be caught soon. No, no. I'm making the arrangements. They've threatened to kill Mr. Rai within 24 hours. -Mr. Rai? -Mr. Balwant Rai, the businessman. D'Souza, a threat to kill Mr. Rai is like challenging the police department. What do these idiots think? They've not challenged Rai, but the police. Be rest assured, sir, they'll be caught very soon. 24 hours might be short for them, but not for us. I trust you, D'Souza. You will arrange for Rai's security. An ordinary boy... threatens me at midnight. He wants to kill me in the next 24 hours. -How was it? -Sir, we'll catch him soon. Our police-- Shut up. Your police, your law is exactly like you. Saroman, keep some of your men at Gupta's house. Kamran, ask your people to spread out throughout the city. Find him, wherever he might be. Get him alive. Otherwise, bring me his dead body. Youth is thirsty The night is stormy Youth is thirsty The night is stormy Thirsty! Thirsty! Thirsty! Nights will pass Live this moment, enjoy yourself There's excitement in the heart Thunder in the chest There are squalls in every breath Amusement spills over From my voluptuous body The heartbeats Increase every moment In this ocean of beauty Come and quench your thirst, crazy one Come on Youth is burning up The night is pleasant Youth is thirsty The night is stormy Thirsty! Thirsty! Thirsty! Nights will pass Live this moment, enjoy yourself Clink! Clink! Clink! Clink! The clouds pour, the body burns up Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! The heart beats I cannot control myself Poison is coursing through the veins Now I can't find any peace Jiggle! Jiggle! Jiggle! My body quivers Will somebody embrace me? The body is also thirsty Love is also thirsty This occasion is truly thirsty The body is also thirsty Love is also thirsty This occasion is truly thirsty Light a fire in this weather Put out the fire, with fire Youth is thirsty Youth is hot Youth is hot Youth is thirsty Youth is thirsty Youth is hot Youth is hot Youth is thirsty This is an absolute lie! This is a conspiracy! Mr. Gupta, can you throw some light on... What are you saying, uncle? Fear God... -Don't believe him. He is lying. -What are you saying? Ajay had an illicit affair with his sister-in-law. Where is Kamle? He leaves the gate open quite often. Laxmi! Dad. Wait a minute. -Sir, where is Gupta? -He's Gupta. This is Gupta? Sir, he gave us 24 hours. Deka and Gupta are dead in eight hours. We will die soon. He's ACP Joe D'Souza. Pradhan has given this case to him. ACP D'Souza, what's going on in this city? Four murderers break the prison and kill so many people. What's the police doing? The cops are doing their job. Your security is our priority. And I hope you'll help us in this matter. He is talking about support! Mr. Pradhan. Yes, tell me. Sir, Pramod Sharan Gupta has been murdered. -What? When? -Around 6:30! We found other bodies bearing foreign arms. They've not been identified. They are the culprits. Sir, those men... I think there is another reason to these murders. Right now... Pramod Sharan Gupta and the foreign arms... Concentrate on the security of Balwant Rai. -When are you coming to office? -I'm not coming today. -I'm not too well. -What happened? No. It's not necessary for you to come here. Keep me informed about Balwant Rai's programs over the phone. Don't challenge the law. Law? The law sleeps with rascals like Balwant Rai. Brokers like Gupta have sold it. The guardians of the law, like you, have enjoyed this show. And you are telling me not to challenge the law. I was going from pillar to post for my brother in this city. Knocking at the door of law. I met you as well. Remember? Remember that rainy night when I was begging for my brother's life? Do you remember? And one day, Balwant Rai threw my brother's body on the road. And the law punished me by proving me as his murderer! Mr. D'Souza? I wanted to ask you something. Is Ajay Mehra very well with his target? Not really. Why? That means his bullet can go left or right? I see, because you are always around Balwant Rai. Yes. What? Right. Left... I'll be killed. No. Ramu, keep the windows locked. What could be better Than the fact that we are together? What could be better Than the fact that we are together? Smile a little Sing a little This is called life What could be better Than the fact that we are together? Nobody knows When the moment of separation may come When the moment of separation may come Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! You could have called me there. I would have come to the commissioner's house. The cops are looking for you. Why did you come out? Why did you take the risk of coming here? I came to meet brother and sister-in-law, Varsha. They are here, Varsha. They are present in everything here. There was so much happiness in this home. I understand your pain, Ajay. It isn't pain, Varsha. It's fire. Balwant Rai who is responsible for this, is still alive. But he won't be alive tomorrow. I'll kill him today! And, what if something happens to you? Have you ever thought about me? No, Ajay. I don't want to lose you again. What will you get from this fight? Will everything be okay? Will this house become a home again? Varsha, it's not only about me or this home. Who knows how many families he has destroyed? Who knows how many innocent lives he has taken? I agree, this can't be the same home again. But many homes will be saved from destruction. Keep an eye on him. You don't understand. Mr. D'Souza has prohibited you from going out. Alright. -I'll speak with you later. -This is utter rubbish! Do you want me to hide in the fear of that boy? That murderer Ajay Mehra is roaming around freely. And in the name of security, you've put me on house arrest. There is a limit to stupidity. Look, Mr. Rai. Listen, this meeting is very important for me. If you can't arrange my security, I'll arrange it myself. Barrister Gupta made his own security arrangement... with foreign arms. He is dead already. What do you want to say? Ajay Mehra wants to kill you. He must be trying to reach you. Despite knowing, that attacking you is like committing suicide. Mr. Rai, the man who has lost the fear of death, can do anything. Yet, if going to the meeting is so important then you must act in accordance with our plans. -How are you, commissioner? -I'm okay. But, nothing is okay here, sir. I don't understand the police arrangement you've done for me. I've to go for an important meeting, but Mr. D'Souza... He insists that I should go with him in a taxi. And someone else will go in my car instead of me. Amazing! Sir, I have to go to Sea Rock. And he wants to take me through the slums. What should I do? Mr. Rai, Mr. D'Souza is the only person who can save you from death. Do whatever he says. Okay, sir. Take care of him. It was your plan, Mr. D'Souza. See, what's happening! Go out and clear the traffic. Please, come back quickly. What are you doing, Mohile? Sit quietly. I was closing the window. The 24-hour notice has not yet ended. Do you think Ajay will attack you in this crowded market? Not me, sir, but you-- Okay. Stupid. Oh, no! Let's go, driver. Move out of the way! Ajay. Ajay! -You can go! -Mitwa! Cover the back. Mitwa! Ajay, go from here. Go! -Go away from here. Leave! -Give me your hand, Mitwa. Go! -Go away from here. Leave! -Give me your hand, Mitwa. -Mitwa, give me your hand. -Why don't you leave? Mitwa! Why did you shoot him? We could have caught him alive. Sir, he's-- -Let go! Let go off me! Mitwa... -Come on, he is dead. In broad day light, in the middle of the market? This city isn't worth living. Make the arrangements for my London visit. I'm talking you, Mohile. What are you doing? Sir, I was closing the window so that the bullets... Yes! I warned you. You all will meet the same fate as your companion. You're competing with death, not the law. What you are calling a fight, isn't actually a fight, but suicide. This is my advice to you as an elder one, not as a commissioner. Surrender while you still have time. I'll help you as much as possible. -Stop it! -No! No! An important announcement. Four prisoners absconding from jail have caused terror in the city. One of the four prisoners called Mitwa was killed in an encounter with the police. Our correspondent has told us that the police have intensified their efforts to arrest them. Police posts have been set up on all the roads going out of the city. The police are also patrolling all the city areas. They have threatened to kill Balwant Rai in 24 hours. While the police are protecting Mr. Balwant Rai, a prominent newspaper has described him as a smuggler. Balwant Rai exposed! Balwant Rai exposed! He's a smuggler. Balwant Rai exposed! I'm being called a smuggler. I am a traitor. And that murderer is fighting the war for justice. Damn it! I don't know what will happen to this country! I don't want to live here anymore. What about my London ticket? Mohile? -What are you doing over there? -I'm locking this door. Do you think Ajay will walk in and kill me, in my home? Maybe he can. Our police... I'll deal with everybody. And I'll sue Varsha in court, for defamation. I won't spare anyone. Forget it, Mr. Rai. Such a case might prove harmful to your fame. Think about your life first! You can sue her, if you're alive! Mr. Rai, the point is... only you, me and your men knew about... the route that we took. Whereas Ajay was already waiting for you there. The whole city is struck by terror and you published this article! Ajay Mehra is a murderer and the cause of this bloodshed in the city. And you've made such a vicious man the protagonist of your story. It isn't a story, it's real, Mr. D'Souza. And the police are also responsible for this. The police compelled an ordinary man to become a criminal! Ajay. What do you know about Ajay? Just that he is a murderer? He murdered his brother? He had an illicit affair with his sister-in-law? It wasn't my intention to hurt your feelings. I was... Here's how I know him. Not only do I know Ajay... I understand him completely. I was the one who went to see him in prison on the 19th of December. And I met him today. I wasn't being emotional while I wrote this article. I wrote it responsibly. I don't have any personal enmity with Ajay Mehra. In a way, I'll be helping him by arresting him. Because you know the consequence of the path he has taken. If you meet him again you should ask him to... He might obey you, because you know and understand him. Varsha Bharti, the one who wrote that article is Ajay's beloved. She met him today. I wonder why D'Souza left her! If I were in his place, I'd have arrested her on remand and in two minutes, I'd get her to cough up everything. Idiot. You don't understand this simple thing. We can use this to our advantage. We needed... this opportunity. Hello, Varsha. -I'm Joe D'Souza speaking. -Yes? The police were chasing a car with three people in it. The car met with an accident and all three were killed. Now the police suspects that one of them was Ajay Mehra. Don't worry. The police have just suspected. We want you to come... No! No! Ajay... Trace the number she's dialing. Sir, she dialed from the commissioner's home. Commissioner? Can I talk to Ajay? Yes, Varsha? Varsha! Speak up, Varsha! Varsha? Ajay... -What's the matter, Varsha? -Ajay, I... I received a call that you... Ajay! Ajay! Could she be in trouble? Come on! Ask all the nearby police stations to surround the commissioner's home. I'm going there. There should be no lapse of any kind. Nobody should fire. See, there's still time. Please listen to me. If you think we're committing a crime by killing Balwant Rai, then open the door after we leave. Or else, wait until sunset. We'll wait until sunset. Vardha told us everything. Our blessings are with you. Hurry up! POLICE. Run! Run! Ajay, go. He's all right. Catch him. No! Hold him. Go from there. Nothing will happen. Surrender! Or else, you'll be killed. Balwant Rai and his accomplices will be killed. Take this. Inspector, I'm not an animal like Balwant Rai. I'm not a murderer. I can't kill anyone without any reason. Ajay, if you've been wronged, then I'll get you justice. Your whole system is under his foot. They are his slaves. Do you know whose life you're guarding? Ruining people's lives is his profession. Forget about me and use all the police force to save his life. But he won't survive. I'll kill him. I'll kill him today. Ajay. Be careful. Varsha? Varsha? Come, Mr. Ajay. We knew you'd come here. Varsha is in our custody. It's a game, Mr. Ajay. Sometimes you win, sometimes we win. I'd told you, Sharma. If you leave me alive, you'll repent it. Tell me, where's Varsha? Mahakali Road. Old Fort. Rajan! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! -There's mourning on the streets. -The killers are rulers! There's mourning on the streets... Move! Inspector Sharma! No! Inspector, I've written down everything about Balwant Rai. -But, you'll save me, right? -Don't worry. The police are with you. I don't want to die, inspector. Don't worry. You have no shame! He gunned down an officer and you couldn't arrest him. Do we need to call for the special force? He killed Inspector Sharma and tomorrow-- Don't call him an inspector. Sharma was a criminal. Go. What do you want to say? Sir, this is the statement of Balwant Rai's secretary Mohile. This is the record of their illegal dealings. This is the ugly face of that great personality. Inspector Sharma was working for Balwant Rai. And instead of arresting him, we are trying to protect him. Why hasn't the police acted against him? D'Souza. The truth is bitter. And it's also true, that I know everything. It's not that I haven't tried. Whenever I tried, I had to bow down in front of influential people. He is a dangerous man. We aren't the whole system. We are just a small part of it. Our rights are just a facade. Nothing is in our control. Nothing! That means Ajay Mehra is not the culprit. We are! And our rotten legal system is the culprit. Ajay Mehra is the outcome of the dysfunctional legal system. If he had got justice, all this would not have happened. Sir, we can't put an end to this by capturing and killing Ajay. Whenever the law murders justice, a new Ajay is born. Forgive me, sir, but instead of helping such a law I prefer to take off my uniform and support Ajay. No, D'Souza. This department needs... officers like you. And I'm grateful to you for awakening my sleepy consciousness. We'll act against Balwant Rai. We'll have him punished, but according to the law. But before that we must stop Ajay from committing another crime. I promise you, I'll do my best for Ajay in the court. I don't know. How many times will you ask me? I told you that I don't know where Ajay is. And if I knew, I would not have told you. Do you love him a lot? In fact, I was in search of his special weakness. I have his most beautiful weakness in my hands. Now I don't need to find him. He'll come to me on his own. Whether I reach him, or he reaches me, the result is the same. His death. He'll come. He'll surely come. And he'll bring such a storm with him... which will destroy your death factory like a house of sand. You know this. Because I see the fear of death in your eyes. Come out, Balwant Rai. You enjoy seeing others die. And you're hiding when you are about to die today! Come on out, you dog! You rascal! Balwant Rai! Ajay, stop! Ajay, stop! Ajay! Fire. Hey, this is Balwant Rai. -He's a smuggler. -He was mentioned in today's newspaper. He is a drug dealer. There's a fire! Move aside! Move back! -Stop there. Nobody will move. -Hey... -Move! -No! -Move! -Let go of my child! -Mother. -Move! -Leave my child. -Move, or else I'll shoot him. Ajay. Come out. -Or else, I'll shoot this child. -No. -I'll shoot everybody. -No! Ajay, I'll count to three. -One! -Help me. Two! Three! My child! Move! Move out of the way! Leave him! -Leave him! -Ajay! No! Leave him! Ajay! Ajay, leave him! Ajay, leave him. Ajay! Leave him. Ajay! Ajay, listen to me! Ajay, leave him! Let go, what are you doing? Leave him. -Ajay. -No! Ajay, let him die at the hands of the law. -Ajay, don't be a fool. -Move! Take him away. Take him away. Hurry! Ajay! Get aside. Leave him. Ajay! Leave him. Don't hit him. Ajay! -Move aside. -Move aside. Ajay! No! Get aside! Get up. Move. Move back.
