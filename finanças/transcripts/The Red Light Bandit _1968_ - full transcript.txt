A GENIUS OR A BEAST? Who am I? State of siege in the country. - The police force... - Reinforces security... - Any similarity with... - Real... or unreal events, real or fictional characters... - dead or imaginary... - is a coincidence. "THE RED LIGHT BANDIT" It's a western about... the third world. I know I failed. My mother tried an abortion so that I wouldn't starve. I was born like this and who wears shoes won't survive. I was used by the Black Hand criminals cause I didn't know. All I needed was terror. I thought I was in but I was way out of line. I'm suitable for the electric chair. I never did well. I didn't like the criminals. I know I failed. I had to make a mess out of it, just to see the outcome. It was the only thing to do. I left 15 years ago. From the slums I ran the world with a nail on my foot. A few years later... I'm one of the Red Light bandits. I wish I were great. If you don't kill, it's no use. No one knows how many assaults, robbery... incendiary fires and indecent assaults he has already committed. 26 years old, 26 deaths... he's been convicted to 167 years, 8 months, 2 days in prison... besides a 10 cruzeiros fine. I'm 26 years old, I survive with thefts and money from friends. I can say for certain: I'm a jerk. But if he stands another trial it can add to 480 years. The only way to get away with it is by proving he's insane. - Arlete Teixeira... - 23 years. Ex-housewife, ex-midwife... Ex-candidate to the Law school. A popular girl in the neighborhood. The mayor and his new ideas of improving the town... will put an end to the red light district. I almost ran over an old lady, the other day. She was the type who crosses the street when she shouldn't. It's different to me, if they wanna live, they got to stay clear. I run over them. They're all crooks. The girl from my neighborhood left, boss. - You know her? - Cynthia, the Flying Jap girl. A junkie. That's the way these guys are. Stuff her with drugs and then they scram. Funny. It all ends up on my hand. As if Light wasn't enough. I told you: It's jail alright. No use begging. I wanna know one thing: Who threw the girl from up there? This one is a nice guy, boss. Mister... how about a cigarette? Beat it, man. Lack of socialism. That's why Brazil won't evolve. Papers. Let's see some papers. Come on. Boss... this one here. Fake documents, you bum. Let's go. The third world will blow! Those who wear shoes can't survive. Arrest me! Brazil's solution is termination! Complete termination! I'm a poet, I see! The third world is gonna blow! Arrest this jerk! It's the empire of drugs, riots and gangsters... - Of mass prostitution... - Of traffic of the underage... Of industrialized crime and automotive trade. A city within the city. - A district full of hunger... - And guilt. - A boca do lixo... - The most complete... - Of all the criminal districts. - The third world will blow! Who wears shoes won't survive. They can't survive. Gangsters are all around. - In politics! - The government! - Families! - Soccer! The Press! Pool tables! - Elections. - In nightlife. Attempted assassinations of the president. - In peace. - In war. Monasteries and prisons. The guilty one might not be the public enemy number one. - The criminal... - District. - Light! Heavy! - Dirty! - Grass! The endless trash, ladies and gentlemen. He may strike any moment... day or night. The masked bandit won't respect women... - nor any private... - Property. I wasn't sure of anything. Thanks God I never was. My story begins in Asunci?n, Paraguay, goes on in Brazil. It's very similar to Mandrake's stories and popular Brazilian movies. I'm not left-handed and I dislike my profession. My weak point is Italian sausage. Wake up, mister! Jewelry and dough. Any tricks and I shoot. - The safe combination? - I can't remember. You'd better remember. Wanna take a bullet in your head? Can't you leave the necklace for my daughter's birthday, Mr. Light? Take it and don't complain. I'm going to America but you shut your mouth. Bring me the omelet, very spiced. Tasty, ma'am. Candy? Blue suits you well. I always liked a well dressed woman. You're talking to the national... champion gunman. I'm penniless but I've got my reputation. How come this man can order us around like this? You do anything... and I finish you, her, everyone. The five of you. Life means nothing to me. Now, I'm having your wife. You shut up. Let's go! Shoot to kill, it's my responsibility. - The back door. - What are your waiting for? Let's go. Let's go. He stirred up crime in Brazil! Don't look for fingerprints. He's a smart ass. Within 48 hours the man shall be in jail... Assures Detective Sade... "Big Head", for his friends. The 17th victim of the bandit cannot make a statement... cause she's still in shock. After all, she's also a human being. Jewelry amounting to 8 million... - Were insured... - for only 750. Modern art. Like I always say: A thing for degenerates. Trash. Yeah, but that painting only was worth 5 million. That's right. The worst it is, the more expensive. I'd gather everything together and set fire to it. I can stand anything but this bunch of intelectual leeches. That's not all, ladies and gentlemen. Before stealing and insulting the unfortunate family... the pervert forced the taxi driver... to the red light district... assaulting him. The driver may survive, but... With one eye. Attention! News from the Continental Patrol. Legitimate sources inform that the impossible has happened, A homeless decided to take the wallet from another homeless. However, both were penniless. The police continues its chase for the Red Light Bandit... who now plays games. But according to our sources, within 48 hours... CITY COPS: IF I MEET YOU ON MY WAY... I'LL PUT BULLETS IN YOUR HEADS. He's blood thirsty. He's abusive! He's a barbarian. "Light", for his friends. Murderer, twice champion of table soccer. The great grandson of Chico, the Devil... the Brazilian who killed President Solano Lopez, on the Paraguay war. - Descendant of aztecs... - And tapuias. A wild man from the XVI century thrown in the middle of a concrete jungle. A Brazilian on the last phase of capitalism. A real... Crook! - An opportunist... - Chased by the police. - A lousy dancer! - Ex-sexual tourist! As a solution... to the transatlantic mess. THE BEST WOMEN IN TO WN... PROMISED THE POT SMOKER CRIMINAL. MARTIN BORMAN, HITLER'S HEIR... MAY NOT BE A REFUGEE IN PARAGU AY. HE MAY BE SPREADING FALSE DOLLARS IN GU ARUJ?, S ?O PAULO. No one knows the true nationality... nor the identity of this young under developed criminal. - Paraguayan? - Brazilian? - Cuban? - Mexican? He didn't break in any mansions... last night, although he said he would. The police has no reports on it. Inspector Big Head believes he's in jail with no identification... since there are more than 15 suspects arrested... and two of them already confessed. The authorities are asking one thing... For God's sake, don't make him a hero... especially the TV and radio... that say he's a good thief, a gentleman... who's robbing from the rich to give to the poor children... To whom he'd be buying candy and ice cream... - Sweets. - This is a lie. - He's a dull... - Bully thief... - A liar possessing... - An endless list of bad words. THANK YOU Take a look at her back and you'll see my red sign. Could there be two bandits? Many cops thought of that. They believed there was a sexual maniac... who had already assaulted five girls. On the other hand, he could be a simple low life criminal. Quiet! Who was the legendary... and most famous bandit of our times? An amazing maniac? A mere clown or was he an insane man looking for the truth? Or was truth unreal? A magician, an outlaw. A low life impressed by his media success? A poor devil from Freud's theories or from the slums? Those who wear shoes won't survive. Mr. Schmidt, owner of the cosmetics trust... and the empire of plastic combs... accused a kid that stole a set of wrenches... from his factory. Unfortunately, he wasn't aware that the kid... was a godson of the Red Light Bandit. Who wears shoes won't survive. With no mercy... he avenged his godson by killing the wife and kids of Mr. Schmidt... who couldn't live without his family. Mr. Schmidt couldn't live without his wife and children. His industries faced a crisis... Causing a surge of panic... in the empire of plastic combs... creating a seesaw situation at the stock market. Who am I? Our things, 52, first. - It's the bankrupt... - It's the crisis. The instability of the parallel market. - Of the stock market operations... - In a giant rationalization of work. - Mr. Schmidt... - A real leader... once the only manufacturer and line distributor... Los Angeles. He can only be a barbarian. Not even science presents those cruelty features. Not even our country guerillas. As we were saying... we're for the death sentence, in favor of society... Because the great family from S?o Paulo... knows that little or even nothing they can offer... to the unfortunate victims. The violent death is a human factor. "Thou shalt not kill", says the bible. Cain was the first one. He was the first and he won't be the last. Since then, the human being has not improved at all. They're the same. Ana Triks, a 69 year old widower from Philadelphia... died yesterday of a heart attack... According to experts... was that man a... - Genius... - Or a beast? Who am I? - Smuggling. - Politics. - Nudism. - Crime. Poetry and party. Sex. Action. In the abnormal film forbidden until 21 years old! In this country, you've gotta be tough to be strong. It was like this in that Italian western, "Gringo". The guy would beat women, he'd kill everybody. And the audience loved it. Then I realized I should be a tough one. So? Got many women last night? - We were drinking. - It was no use. Here's the dough. 2 million! Give me one million and I explode all these cars. Then I go to Acapulco, Mexico and I take you along. That's a promise! - I pay. - Man, 20 years in prison... Watchmen must die. They earn peanuts to guard gold. They must die. - Don't scream. - How come you're in here? Thieves don't ask permission to break in. - I'm nervous. I need some coffee. - Don't scream. - I don't talk to strangers. - I said don't scream, stupid! - You're the stupid here. - Shut up, trash! It's easy for me to kill. Where's the dough? My uncle is traveling, I don't know. If you don't kill, it's no use. Next week, he's going to the States, for a medical treatment. TB, naturally. I'm acquainted with the masked bandit. Brazil, the 60's. The mysterious... Wife of Geronimo, king of the outback... On a long distance call. He was raised in a rich family. He's very intelligent, he's an accountant. He looks like a lawyer. Sometimes, he wants to kill everybody on the streets. I think stealing is his thrust. He gets desperate to strike. He can't see happy people. When he's back and if there are any jewels left... he's giving them away to the poor and the Church. He's a very religious man. They found out. A tinsmith, from S?o Paulo. 32 years old, married, two children. The police is on to him, but he's vanished! This is it. One thing pisses me off. You assault, kill, and nothing ever happens. How come, Big Head? Maybe tonight the bandit will set fire to your home. The thief knows all kinds of woman. Ivonete, nice, no bad habits, exercises free love. Malu, an intellectual, graduated... she loved proms and talking about Cinema Novo. Janete Jane, a woman of the world, a chewer. She's always chewing chewing gum. Salom?, stewardess, 22 years, a serious girl. A catholic, educated. Odete, a calm girl, marimba player. Shirley, the mysterious type. Clotilde, from the pampas. Kind, honest, a bit boring. It's him! The Red Light Bandit. Marlucia, a lone girl, a poet. I forgot her name. A third class tramp. A dentist, accountant assistant when she's free. Taxi! If daddy knows, he'll beat you to death. Wait, honey! I never thought. You're a crook! Can you go a little faster? I have to do my hair, for a hippie party tonight. I just bought this cream. Wonderful! They didn't belong to this world... But to the third world. Although it harms my skin. It gets all crackled. My passion fruit pudding is wonderful! You stir some jelly... until it gets creamy. What about coconut milk? Coconut milk? Lots of coconut milk! Five minutes of Coconut milk. To improve its taste... add some rum drops. Merelique. You know it? I'll only change if there is a cataclysm. The Amazon region belongs to Brazil. There's hunger in the Northeast, the oil is ours! And the Amazon, this green and mighty giant... when will it awake? I'm in the mood for a Britannica. With this outfit I can sign millions of checks in B. Horizonte. They say you die if you drink oil-paint, but I didn't. I already tried to kill myself four times. The first time I was 12 years old. I tried to drown in the washtub. I tried to kill myself with oil-paint, but I couldn't. Arriving from Madrid, Professor J.B. Da Silva... candidate of the criminal district for the presidency. A sensational story by Chico La?o... the crying poet, your reporter. I'll put an end to wars and revolutions. How nice! Because my motto is: The oil is ours! How nice! Thanks for coming, I'm so happy! Very good. Thank you. Why are you here? I came from Spain to learn about this criminal. I'm offering a new car in exchange of his name. Do you have any leads about Light? I know everything, but I'll only talk to Big Head. And two judges, at least. What about Gonzales, your old political enemy... who was found shot to death. What's the outcome? This isn't important. I was acquitted! What were you doing in Spain? I was visiting my friend, the former President Per?n... who's coming to Brazil for a visit to my family... and to inaugurate a branch of the Latin bank. Have you read Fernandes article? They call me a gunman but I'm not a thief! You hear me? I'm not a thief! Brazil is living days of agitation. Men are shot to death at their own doorsteps. How about a beer to celebrate you son's first communion? - It's the elder one? - We're on duty. And it's my daughter. Do you believe we're grabbing the guy right here? I don't think he's insane. For me, he's mocking us all the time. It's tough. One of these days, you'll see... my heart will stop. The doctor told me to quit smoking. It's not that easy. I tell you, the only serious thing in life... is your heart. The rest is bullshit. You smoke a strong one. - I tried American brands. - They cause cancer. They're all the same. The American brands cause cancer, the national kills. The same. Let's go. What concerns me is the precinct. If I'm gone, what will they do? It takes time to get to know everything. I'm here, boss. You too? You're a motherfucker. I said nothing, boss. Give me a cigarette. - Another one? - Forget it. Let's go. - Janete Jane... - The indecorous girl. For a long time I was out of the streets. They said I was on a spiritual trip... at the Andes mountains. I was in Belo Horizonte, for the birth of my nephew. My name is Janete Jane. Hi, there Jorginho. When you're leaving to Greece? I've given up, I won't go anymore. - You OK? - Fine, thanks God. God my ass! There is no God. - You sold your farm? - My taxis, too. I never liked living with my parents. I'd rather live alone, selling books door-to-door. Special gift of the house, for you. With my autograph. Right, you're loaded. Life is not easy. It's easy for a Rockefeller. Frank Sinatra was right. Nothing good at the beach. I ate some snacks. I had a good lunch, with no fear of death. Red Light. What is your game? - There's no game. - What do you expect from life? Nothing. I used to wish I were great. What for? Beats me. I wanted to be famous, for good or bad. Now I know I'm a poor bastard, I'm nothing. It's five already? A quarter to. Of course I'm destroying myself. Alone you can't do anything. I wanted to be powerful. When you can't do anything, You mock. You mock and screw it up. I should have seen my horoscope... so I wouldn't be hearing this crap. The demolisher is no use. Without a bullet in the head, it's hard. You can't do nothing, you mock. Mock and screw it up. It can't be a flat tire. It's the third this week. I've a stomach ache. Must be that cheap whiskey. It's always like that. But this is gonna end! Of course it will. Jane! I almost got killed in Acapulco. I spent more than 6 months in Argentina, I starved... I worked for free at a circus in Mato Grosso. I raised hell. Always like that. Everywhere I go it's the same. Rebellion meant terror to me, but not anymore. The third war has began and nobody cares. I'm gonna burst! So what? So what? What is it that you want? I know I'm a loser, Jane. My mother wanted to abort me. I learned that last week. That's why I was born like this. Excuse me... if what I'm saying is not true, but a simple lie. I tried to kill myself. It's true. I swallowed water to end it once and for all. As a solution to the transatlantic mess. - It's the bomb... - And hunger... In the XX century... The bomb... - And hunger... they separate the third world from the rest of the Earth. Who am I? Minister, how many shots? Not minister. Secretary. Some 5 thousand, but only 37 hit me. My body is protected by my saints... Cosme and Dami?o. And your program? I am the program. Someone had to come forward, a mystic man like me... to shed hope to this people. I'll open up prisons... I'll build the home for the single father... I'll create Christmas for naughty children... and the poor will be able to chew. Chewing gum to the poor, so that they'll chew night and day. And the peasant, this forgotten being... will be receiving electrical picks... and there's more: I'll build... the home for the broke millionaire! Young man, if the elections are tampered... I'll settle the matter with my gun. A question from a viewer. How come you are so lucky? It's the Providence. My guardian angel has always guided me... and I'm also confident of my ability. Cause I can hit a cigarette 20 meters away. If I use my 32 revolver, of course. - It's your favorite? - Yes, since I was young. Ever thought of being a diplomat? Not a diplomat, nor Portuguese teacher or architect. What do you think of bullet proof vests? I wear one for 30 years already. They say the minister is an expert guitar and piano player. Camera one... now! Go! A new Mozart... writing waltzes, chorinhos... this kind of thing. - Ever killed someone? - No! God kills. - What about the bombs? - Bullshit. - Is there a terrorist scheme? - Don't make me laugh. What about the names? Six low life headed by Light. The real atomic bomb of the moment... I'm going to throw at the launching of my campaign... at the Epop?ia Club. I'll say everything there. But it was said... that you're not able to run the state... let alone the country. Son, you don't know me. I can destroy a lot of people, if I want. Cut! Dear viewer... we've just presented another edition of "The leader's voice". - Turn that off! - I gave you the money. Give me money for the doctor. Otherwise, I'm leaving right now. Give me money for the doctor. Without the money for the abortion... I'm leaving. You wanted me, now face the consequences. - Lucho Gatica, a.k. A... - Mexican... J.B. Da Silva thug... - pot dealer, pool player and... - Pimp... Made a lot today? - How much do I owe you baby? - 3.500,00. All right. - My dough, bitch! - I do as I please! A pimp! Think I'm a fool? I don't take orders! Grab your stuff. I don't want to see you ever more. Desperate for not having got what she wanted... - more money, she tries and steal... - Jorginho. And she finds out his real identity. The Red Light bandit, the popular mask man. Seven different names: Including Ari Galante, an industry owner. Jorge Vargas, a bookseller. Ceres Prado, a farmer in Rio Grande. - Ex-waiter in Campo Grande... - Ex-broker... ex-salesman of nail cutter in S?o Paulo... - ex-third class theater doorman... - ex-bank employee in Acre. The masked bandit is a relative of Mineirinho... and godson of Bishop Helder Camara. You checked the back? - All clear. - OK, go to the other side. After the sixth terrorist attack in 24 hours... Brazil faces the criminal fury of mysterious rebels... who throw bombs at factories, bars, buildings... before the public is able to forget the strange objects... that fly all over the country. 24 hours later... - J.B. - Goes... to Epop?ia Club... saying serious accusations... at the launching of his candidate campaign. Vote Prof. J.B. Da Silva... Our candidate, the candidate of the red light district. They say because they can't say otherwise. They know me! You know that! Our history is right here. Here, page 34, act 86, of 1920. Here! They don't understand. This is what they want. I know what I say, I know what I can do. Here is the evidence, friends! They want it, not me! Not for that! Not at all! I won't accept any investigation. I won't accept this! You don't know me! You don't! It doesn't matter, I want to know... INSPECTOR, THE RED LIGHT BANDIT IS HERE We don't want another Vietnam in Brazil. No, sir. They want to implement the third sex in Brazil. The police admits new attacks can occur from now on... Booze. And intensifies the repression, conducting hundreds of arrests. The terrorism is loose! The bomb that exploded in Estado Avenue... has not hit the house of Inspector Big Head. It exploded against the wall. Debris are spread all over the area. Attention! Beware! You can be one of the citizens to be shot in front of your home... in your car, right on a downtown street. I had one more bomb to go. A larger one, to overcome all others. I thought I was great... but I was way out of line. I was an idiot. - Meanwhile... - At the blue house... I always suspected J.B. As the leader of the Black Hand. The papers say I'm the big shot, a genius... a poet with a gift from God. Sharing the intimacy of the Black hand gang... And the new gunman. You say you fear me. I'm talking to you, thieves of Brazil. Well, I'm afraid... of the first guy to come, aim at me and hit me good. Who owns something, good. Who doesn't, won't. I was a sucker in the hands of the Black Hand. They used me for political ends. The rebel forces call for volunteers for... A total rebellion. They accept the responsibility for the terrorism... to avenge the assassination of Miss Home Queen... by the renowned organization, the Black Hand. - More terror in Guanabara! - Men and women... - Papers. - Show us your papers, bum. The authorities deny the idea... that this might be caused by international invaders... but they say that apparently, it begins terrorism in Brazil. The terror has been established and no one knows what can happen. Everything is possible! Who's the prince? That afternoon, the police took Lucho Gatica and Tata... former members of the secret police of President... - Per?n... - and thugs of... J.B. Da Silva, the great. Face the wall! Go! You too! The wall! Take off your coat. I found a gun here. You won't escape. Help me hold this guy. Several members of the Black Hand were arrested... Except Light. After the arrest of J.B. Assistants... Light was prepared for any informer within the gang. I have only a few questions. Anything for the paper. Give me a break! Go back and tell them it's against our rules. - You got it? - What about the German? I don't even know this guy. You might get involved if you don't talk. If this guy shows up here, send him away. If you let him in, you'll get it. Hello, professor. You already know? Yeah, the cops. Lucho and Tata were selling false dollars... then I told the press, just to clear things out... I told them this: Both are suspects in the case of the masked bandit. Haven't I said not to disturb me while I'm at my massage? Leave it to me. Look, honey. Light is yours and mine, understand? Talk to the press, to Big Head... The house of the man who became a symbol of the political mob... could be a prison, a torture chamber or a fortress. Located on the district, the legendary blue house... had never been penetrated by the authorities. "Only God and my friends are allowed to my house", said J.B. "The rest won't pass." 3,200 square meters, with its own electrical power... full of complex secret equipment... such as trap door, secret exits, mirrors and cameras. This is the true story of the man... who drank a bottle of foreign scotch every day... - the inventor of the trick... - To win the lottery... and the magical guitar method by mail. The man who introduced bad words in politics... - the chief... - The king... of the law of a huge empire... - The red light district... - where there are... not inhabitants, only survivors. 49 years ago, on the day of my first communion... I promised I'd be president to end the people's misery. A congressman, at least. But he was elected only in 1934... because he betrayed S?o Paulo in the Rebellion of 1932... And he always surrounded... - his life with... mystery. - What do you think of poverty? What poverty? A country without poverty has not folklore. And without folklore, what do we have for tourists? Voodoo was his religion. - He boasted he spent... - Monthly... over 5 million... with hospitals and charity. J.B. Da Silva tries to evade seven law suits... including one for arson... and another for smuggling over half a million cans... of rotten sardine. Light's hideout discovered! Janete Jane, Light's ex-lover. She informed the police. I need a nice corpse. Let's quit stalling! I need a homicide for the first page. - Talk. - J.B. And the German... were selling dollars in Curitiba. If J.B. Won't give a clue on Light... tomorrow his crimes will be on the headlines. Tell them I said that. Font 14, bold letters. Got it? Your gambling house is broke? Put an end to gambling in Brazil? You are na?ve. The German was arrested because of the money. Don't bother me! I have one of the best lawyers of the country for you. - The very best. - Please, I did my best. No, you're good. Splendid! - Together we're strong. - Are you a maid, dear? Yes, sir. - What about you? - Construction, minister. Not minister. Secretary. Secretary. I have a question. They said that the German... distributed over 100 thousand false dollars. Is it true? This is childish. Bullshit! And what if he's Borman, minister? Don't call me "minister". In case your secretary were really Martin Borman... would you give him in to the police? A war criminal is equal to any other criminal. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. The strange objects shaped as balls... continue to focus the attention of the country, flying over... I know the German for 40 years. He taught me to swim, to ride a bike. No, not him. Not the German. Do you believe in the amnesty, minister? Don't call me minister! The hell with that! I still believe in justice and humanity. Justice is always there, like Holy Mary and the animals. What could poor people and me expect in this life? I never made myself the big bucks! I'm nobody. My dream is to be forgotten by all of you. I don't want to be a candidate, they do. Look. The people want me. The people. Look! It's the people. Sing and send away your sadness. Whiskey for everybody. The king is paying. MY LAST BOMB Indeed, I'm the greatest. The big shot. - What? - The greatest. Calm down, German. War is war. Who would foresee the German as a war criminal? - A former man... - Of the Third Reich. Could he be the real guilty party... the real forger of the 250 thousand dollars... sold in S?o Paulo and Rio? Hooray to poverty! My real dream is to establish the United States of Latin America. Could he be, as suspected, Martin Borman... responsible for the termination of half a million souls? Hitler's right hand? Lose in Latin America? The king of the district was screwed up! He was killed by a bomb in his car. May I turn into a sick dog... if I don't call out one of the demons... to have the soul of the bastard rotting in hell. Now he'll pay me. Damn you! I was the only one left. Nice. Now I think everything will be over. Do I call them? I don't know if it's worth. Eight million? If you're sure, then I call. It's for my children, who are hungry and being disgraced in the school. Let's go! Over there. - Here, boss. - That way. Freeze! Nothing. - You checked that side? - Yes, sir. He's not easy. Give me a cigarette. - Again? And your heart? - Forget it. There's transplant. A man was blinded by a light from space. At the district, something was seen on the sky. I'm tired, but here comes another one. One thing I was deadly sure of. There is no god. This is gonna blow. Who's wearing shoes won't survive. I had to leave all that mess, that hell... that won't change not even the color of your tie. The rehearsal for my death wasn't like that. 13 THOUS AND MARINES... INVADE BAHIA... The wire! No... it's the wrong guy. They will laugh at us. Here we are, wasting time with a low life. Look down at this poor face! I'm gonna have to change this crown, look... Watch out boss! Mamy. While the bandit... Light, for his friends... - ended his career of... - crimes... - death and... - destruction... - with a short circuit at the... - slums... they came from the east... That afternoon, the mysterious objects... the same unidentified flying objects... with a strange noise and a strong red light... - causing the postponement of a... - marriage... - in Los Angeles... - a transplant... - in Acapulco... - and a rally... in Porto Alegre. Five lights come from Antarctic. No one knows of their intentions. A sensational story at Continental... - mine... - yours... - our station. - The barbarians invasion. Within 10 seconds they may reach Brasilia. A terrible red light is on everything. The third world will blow. Who's wearing shoes won't survive. Nobody knows what is going to happen. The streets are invaded by the people. The police is trying to avoid... The worst. Only a miracle, ladies and gentlemen... Only a miracle can save us from... - total... - termination! The conspirator is the dreamer of the absolute! An unknown face in the crowd. It's enough to disturb... powerful men all over the world. Conclusion: Alone, you ain't worth... Anything. So what?
