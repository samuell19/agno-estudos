Something really horrifying happened at our school. The super tough new kid from Seoul that won a 17-on-one rumble... ...faced off our school's best fighter, Jo Taewoong. (The Legendary Lackey) Strawberry milk! Hurry! Minsu. -Was three minutes too short? -No. Then why were you late? Don't be late. You can go now. Taewoong, you hear about the new transfer student? Transfer student? Oh, right. I heard about him. He's got quite the reputation. Rumors of a really tough new kid. His nickname is the Slipper of Garibong. An atomic puncher from Seoul. He fought 17-on-one, and all of his opponents got hospitalized. Then he was forced to transfer here. He has a 99 percent chance... ...of fighting Jo Taewoong. That fool? Why? Does that fool have to be on my radar? Come on, Taewoong. No way, man. It's not like that. The Slipper of Garibong? If he comes at me, I'll bury him. For sure. Beat him up good. The teacher is coming! -Teacher... -You little punk. Do I have to send you all to Hawaii for you to get it together? Jo Taewoong. Stop. You've had enough. So I'm sure you've all heard. We're getting a new transfer student in our class. Come on in. His name is Kang Chan. He's from Seoul. Be nice to him. Got it? Well? Yes. Dang it... Kang Chan's his name, right? Judging from that glare, it seems like the rumors are true. I'll have to put him in his place soon. Cocky jerk. Dang it! Dang it? You rude high school pipsqueak. Dang it? Apologize and go. Apologize? And what if I don't? Dang it! Who's making all the racket? Hey, mister. Do you own this place? Who are you? -Hey! -Taewoong, are you okay? What's happening? Let's go see. He doesn't have a pulse. Hey, man. Did you do this to him? It's been released again. Hey, you. You're in my class, aren't you? I remember that impressive glare of yours. Yeah. And? I'm Kang Chan. I'm going to the pool hall. Want to come? Pool sounds good. I'm Taewoong. Jo Taewoong. Let's go. The new kid beat up a big older guy within an inch of his life yesterday. He had blood dripping out of his mouth. The new kid did that? I almost pooped my pants. I saw it all. You were pretty good at pool yesterday. I only remember being hit by pool cues. They scare me and throw off my game. You play soccer? I'm pretty good at that. I don't like to waste my energy. Minsu. Go buy some pastries. Chan, want anything for breakfast? -Just ask him. -I don't snack. If your body becomes sluggish... ...so do your fists. A fighter should watch what he eats. So determined... What's wrong? You alright? It's nothing. Hold on. I'm fine. Sometimes my knife wound gets sore. You've been stabbed before? Where? -Want to see? -Yes. A knife wound! That's enough. It's a painful memory. What are you staring at? Go get my food. (2 months later) Chicks like a guy with guts. Like me. If you... Forget it. Stand up and I'll show you. Let's say you see the girl you like. You approach her. Then...look her in the eyes. -Then what? -"I love you." And it's a wrap! That's how I dated every girl in Mapo, Seoul. That's all you need to do. I hear someone at school has been taking other kids' money. I hope we don't have any low-lifes like that in this class. And if we do, you'd better not let me catch you. Whether I catch 100 or 1000 of you, you know I beat only one person, right? Well? -Yes. -Yes. So our class is getting another transfer student today. He's from Seoul and he gets really good grades. So don't bully him and be nice to him. Come on in. Geez, that guy sure looks uptight. His name is Seo Jaewoo. He went to the same school as you, Chan. Make sure you show him the ropes, alright? Yes. Hey, new kid. Were you close with Kang Chan? Not really. I heard he was legendary in Seoul. What did they call him? "The Slipper of Garibong." I heard he ended many guys with his fists. Is that what they say? As soon as he transferred here, Taewoong became the second number one. He's got wild eyes. How should I say...? He's got charisma. You can see it. What does that fool keep smirking at? He must be crazy. Hey, go bring that fool here. What? Who was it? Who dares glare at Jo Taewoong? Was it you? Chan... ...that fool was... Why are you all worked up, though? Hey, Taewoong. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people looking down on you. You guys better not try to stop me. Hey, new kid. Come with me. This is huge. Follow me. You're dead meat. I'm going to destroy you today. Your necktie is all loose. I'm sorry. What is it? Got something to say? So the thing is... Long time no see, Jaewoo. They've been asking me what you were like in Seoul. I hear you're quite a tough guy here. So? -What'd you say? -Good question. What should I say? I guess you're nervous... ...that I'll tell everyone about your past. Hey! So don't push me. Jaewoo. Hey, Jaewoo. What is it now? Just 10 seconds. Just wait for 10 seconds. Please. Man, this is a first for me. Alright. You won't do that again. And I should let it slide this time. It's good to fess up to your mistakes. Gosh, look at him tremble. These are all good guys here. Don't be nervous and eat your lunch. Hey, let's give this guy a hand for his mistake. Clap. Geez... Jaewoo, you okay? Hurry and eat up. People have an intimate connection with sex. People wish to have a sexual relation... ...with someone they love to connect with them. Vending Machine. Vending Machine! Hey, Vending Machine. Answer when I talk to you. You're totally out of it. Need more beatings? I'm sorry. -Four pizza breads. -Four... -Two chocolate milks. -Two chocolate milks... -One strawberry milk. -One strawberry milk... -Three sausages. -Three sausages... -And a cola. -One cola. Alright. Get going. I'm going. You have a call. ...five, six, seven, eight! â™ª Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (Mom) Hey, mom. Me? Just felt like getting some air. Mom, don't get sick when I'm not around. And don't skip your meals. Okay. Thank you for raising me, mom. I love you, mom. Transfer? What do you mean...? Transfer? I'm transferring? Hey, are you crazy? You almost killed me! Is that what you say to the guy who saved your life? Psycho... The drop from here wouldn't kill you. And this won't solve your... I'm transferring! A new school! I'm transferring! I'm transferring to a new school! (Transfer Square, Transfer Real Estate) (Transfer Plastic Surgeon, Transfer Bar) -Two colas. -Two colas! What's with you? And pizza bread. Pizza bread. I bet you want pizza bread. Pizza bread! Did he go crazy? Pizza bread! I love you! Only one left. Oh, yes! Chan! Chan! Why are you just standing there? Did you see my goal? It was like a work of art! Yes, I saw it. Minsu's a terrible goalie. He runs away from the ball! Hey. So... ...you're saying he let me score on him? No. Hey! Minsu! I'm going to pound you every time you get scored on! Keep your eyes open, you hear? Hey. You've got a cannon for a leg. How can he block all those? Stop exaggerating, man. What's that fool doing there by himself? You...took care of him, right? Of course I did. Come on! I really taught him a lesson. Alright. I know you wouldn't have let him off easy. Let's go. Let's go! Pass, pass. What's going on? Hey! Hey! What are you doing? What did you talk about? -Us? -Yes! You two! What are you plotting...? I asked him what textbooks he used in Seoul. (Math) My grades are pretty good, but for the exams... It's hard stuff. You study the hard stuff. It's thanks... ...to guys like you that Korea... ...has a bright future. Well, that's what I think. Hang in there. No need to talk about me. Alright? Just carry on where you left off. What the...? Moron! I told you to block the shots! You got mud for brains? Did you want a beating that badly? Have some sense. Taewoong! Stop it. What did I just do? Have I gone crazy? Chan... ...you trying to throw down? Me? With you? I don't think so. If you act like this... ...I can't back down. Let's go. Let's rumble. -Should we go up to the rooftop? -Bring it! Follow me. What? What is it? You want to fight here? You think I'll chicken out? Taewoong. You disappoint me greatly. What are you talking about? The lonely life of a fighter that's constantly smelling of blood. I didn't expect anyone else to, but I thought you'd at least understand, Taewoong. You should know too! A fighter's loneliness! Sure, I do. I know all about that. They say when you meet a true friend... ...you can recognize them right away. I too... ...have finally found someone like that. Even his name is splendid. Jo... ...Taewoong. The sparks I felt when I first saw you, I will never forget. For real? Taewoong! I respect you. Your... ...courage. Bravery. Your... How should I say...? ...charisma! What's this smell? It's not coming from me. Found it. The smell of a tough man! Stop exaggerating, man. I'm not exaggerating, dude. Your hand, I want to protect it as a cultural asset. Do you know how much I worried earlier that you'd scratch this hand? Hey! You should've told me it was about that sooner. But... ...I had no idea you thought of me like that. Dude... You feel that? I'm trembling. You're... ...inside of me. Ouch. Be gentle. What happened to you? You okay? Those low-life thugs. This isn't the first time. I'm fine. At least Chan put a stop to it early. He didn't do anything. Chan and Taewoong are the same guy. Hey! That's not true. Chan's different from that low-life Taewoong. He never bullies anyone for no reason. He's a decent guy. Anyway, a lot of the guys are saying that Chan and Taewoong should fight... ...so that Chan can become the school's top dog. What's so good about that fool? -Stand up straight. -Yes. Hey, Vending Machine. You're going to transfer? Without telling me? I'm sorry. Hey. What is it? We've spent so much time together. We should give you a proper goodbye. Choose your replacement. But... I... Little rat. I said to choose. Choose someone! Choose someone! Choose! -Him! -Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Very nice choice, Chan. Alright. Hey, Seo Jaewoo. As of today, you're our official lackey number two. Hey, Chan. Thanks, man. I've hated this punk from day one. Lackey one. You're lackey two. Okay? I'm going to make school... ...a lot more interesting for you from now on. Say hello... ...to your predecessor. Look at him glare. Stop glaring. Jaewoo. Jaewoo, what are you doing? Class is starting soon. Let's get going. Wow, I've never seen Taewoong get so scared. -Don't be ridiculous. -Hey. I wish Chan was top dog. That punk Taewoong... I really like your hand. So let's take care of it. Apply hand cream... Geez, look at this little wimp. All those beatings should make you tougher. Hey, new kid. What's with those cocky eyes? What? You looking for a fight too? Low-life scum... Hey! What you just say? One more time so I can hear. I heard you were Chan's slave in Seoul. You think he can protect you here? Is that what Chan said? That I used to be his slave? Jeez. Chan, what did you say this fool's nickname was? Vending Machine? Yo, Vending Machine. What do I get when I press this button? What about this button? Give me something. Want to know who the real Vending Machine is? -You little son of a... -Stop, Taewoong! No! Come on, Taewoong. We said we were going to take care of your hand with plenty of hand cream. Have you lost your mind? What are you looking at? Face forward! What is the meaning of this in our hallowed class? Go back to your seats! Taewoong... ...calm down. Calm down. Have a seat. Taewoong backs down when Chan tells him to. Chan must be stronger for sure! I'm heading out. Taewoong... True... Friends. -That's so cool. -Hey, man. That's not the hand of a person. You animal. -Later. -See you. Get home safe. What a relief. I survived. Totally fooled them again today. Jeez, I almost peed myself. If you have something to say, hurry. I need to go to prep class. You're... ...not going to tell the guys, right? Why? You afraid? Jaewoo... ...just stick to your studies and keep quiet. And why would I do that? Isn't it obvious? I have a friend for the first time ever. And I don't have to run errands anymore, so... So you want me to keep my mouth shut. I never want to live like that again. But... ...is Taewoong really your friend? It's weird. Why does talking about a friend make you tremble? Hey, man! You think you're going to be safe? You were a lackey too. If my past comes out, you and I are both finished! Don't you know that? Thanks for the advice... ...former lackey one. "11th grade top dog Jo Taewoong" No, no, no... No way. Chan... ...keep your head on straight. You can't go back to how it was. Never. (11th grade top dog Jo Taewoong equals Kang Chan) Taewoong, does it hurt a lot? Not a lot. I'll go to the pharmacy for you. No. I'm gaining weight. No way. I'll get it for you. I respect you, sir! What's this? I've heard much about you, sir! Especially that 17-on-one fight. That was legendary! I respect you, sir! Oh, so you heard that story? Hey. Pay tribute properly. Potato chips? You cocky punk. What grade and class are you in? Lift your head. -Yikes! -You startled me. Jeez! That fool startled me. So... ...are you older than me? No, sir. -You did your military service, right? -No, sir. I was born in 2000. I'm a 10th grader in classroom 3. Yoo Minsang. This guy's a liar. Sir... I want to be like you, sir. Minsang... Yes, Minsang... I respect you, sir. I want to become a legend like you too! Please accept this! Gosh. Thanks. Potato chips. Thanks for these. See you. I respect you, sir! -Hey, did you hear? -What? Last time during that soccer game, when Chan dragged Taewoong away... Yes? ...Taewoong begged Chan on his knees to spare his life. For real? Taewoong acts so tough, but he's just a nobody. And... ...I can tell Chan is a lot stronger. Are you a pervert? I hear a ringing. Hey. What do you fools think of Chan? Chan? He's nice. He doesn't send us on errands. Or borrow our gym clothes. You little traitors... Yo, should we start working under Chan instead? Chan's a lot better. Way better. Chan is more magnanimous. I heard that too. -Chan. -Yes. It's time for you to get yourself a lackey. Who do you want? Pick someone. A lackey? I've had a lot of those before. It's a hassle. But we have rules here. They must be followed. What? Want me to pick one if you can't? No, no. I'm good. For real. Let's see... I'm fine. I don't need anyone like that. It's cool. Hey. New kid. Get over here. Hey! You deaf? If you have something to say, come here. That's cute, punk. Fine. I'm coming to you. -Chan. -Yes? Starting today, he's your lackey. Lick it up. Why should I? You little punk, you need convincing. Why are you being like this? I know you've done this before. Taewoong! Stop this. If I stop, will you hit him? Hey, come on! We agreed to let our fists rest! I don't want my true friend Jo Taewoong paying any mind to this scrub! True friend? Oh, please... You two are friends? Yet, you're afraid of your own friend? Jaewoo! Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind? This guy has totally lost it! Don't you remember this fist? You need a beating to get your head on straight! Shut your mouth and come with me! You're dead! Chan. Do it here... ...in front of me. Here? I know you're trying to talk this out with him. You always act like such a nice guy, which makes me look like more of a scumbag. The boys want you to be top dog instead of me now. Taewoong... ...don't believe such childish... I am childish! Chan... ...now that we're on the subject, I want to fight you. One week from now in the assembly hall. If you beat me, you're top dog, and I'll never bully anyone again. Hey. I'm trying to do something nice thanks to you. I'll look forward to it. Eyes down! Hey, Chan. We're just saying this in case you misunderstand. We don't really like Taewoong that much either! Yes! We're...on your side no matter what. Chan, you can do it! Alright. Hold on. What happened? This. Dang it. I think I broke my leg! It's broken! Hey, kid. Did you see me break my leg? Jeez... Call an ambulance! Hey! That was a hit and run! I'm going to report you to the cops, kid! Dang it. What? What? You think that's going to kill you? What is it to you whether I die or not? What? Why do you keep showing up around me? Fine. I was trying to break my leg and be hospitalized. Happy? Be honest. You transferred to this school to get back at me. Right? It's true. So there. Are you happy now? You've ruined everything. I hate you. Chan... "I'm an 18-year-old guy..." "...that's never been in a fight in his life..." "...and now, I have to fight the school bully." What do I do? What's this? "You have hope." "Transfer to a different school." I already transferred, and I have to transfer again. (Due for death) (You should transfer. Call the police. Apologize) (Just get hit. Hit him first. Be a man. One-on-one.) What are you doing? Hey. I have an announcer interview tomorrow. Be quiet. Uncle, how can you be so shameless? You can't be an announcer with that face. You jealous of my looks? Hello, viewers. This is Kang Hyeonmu of KBC News. Last night in Busan, there was a shocking incident... ...where high school student K was assaulted by another student and died. Assaulted and died... Assault, assault... Assaulted and died... This world is still so messed up. Stuff like this doesn't happen at your school, right? What? What's with these kids? If I caught those little punks, I'd crush them! They need a beating to come to their senses. How could they still act like that in this day and age? You know what my nickname used to be? The Crazy Shih Tzu! I never let go of what I bite! Why I ought to... You little punks! You all need a beating! Uncle. -Uncle, do me a favor. -What's with you? -Can you help me out just once? -What? There's this tough kid in my school named Taewoong. And I have to fight him. So could you take care of this for me somehow? Uncle, please? Go! A... E... E... E... E... I... O... Go! Just go! The Kang Chan movement. How can he study at a time like this? He's really scary. Doesn't seem nervous at all. (To Taewoong, whom I respect...) (To my loving Taewoong) Hey. Taewoong. I thought about it. Do we really have to come to blows? I have no interest in taking your place. For real. -Is that so? -Yes. Then kneel before me while everyone watches. -What? -That's the only way to save my pride. Fine. I can do that. It's not like I don't have knees. Gosh... Right. How can the mighty Chan kneel in front of a nobody like me? Sorry for even bringing that up. Just go. Hurry and go. Eat your bread and go. It's your fault for being a part of my body. I'm sorry. What a sight. Dumb people always hurt themselves. What's your deal? How did you know I was here? -What are you going to do with that? -What's it to you? Who do you think got me into this mess? Just go. Wait, hold on. This is good. Take this. See this? A nice clean hit in my shin. Do it properly. Alright. Okay. Let's do this. Let's do this! If you don't want to get beaten to death, practice that. Here. I filled this with videos of that move. It may seem cheap and dirty, but so what? You should be prepared. I'm out. That... ...psycho... (D-6) (D-5) (D-4) (D-3) (D-2) (D-1) "You're dead, Jo Taewoong!" They're going to fight! Run, run! Let's go! Why aren't you running? You don't know? Let's go. Let's hurry. Wow. I didn't know you had so many fans, Chan. The rules are simple. The one who falls first loses. Agreed? Taewoong, let's think about this again. I told you last time. I'm your true friend. You still live in here... Why are you so chatty before a fight? Let's get started! Get ready! Start! Chan's eyes seem ready. He has the eyes of a starving beast! My underwear... ...feels wet. God, Buddha, Allah... Oh, Lord! Let's just hit him once. Let's go! Taewoong! -What is this? -Who shut the lights off? What happened? Hey! Don't pull my hair! You'll pull it all out. What's that sound? Did you hear a beating? What the...? Whoa, momma. Whoa, daddy. I guess the rumors were true. You can fight. I'm not going easy on you now. You're dead meat! Chan! Chan! Chan! I knew Chan would win! The beast among beasts! A new legend! Chan! Chan! Do you smell something stinky? What are you saying? I only smell grass. Stop being ridiculous. I can't believe it the more I think of it. You planned all of that? Nope. I just turned the lights off. It was those guys who did all the real work. There were rebellions in the Goryeo era. This was like a rebellion of the lackeys. How could you brag about yourself at a time like this? You punk. You know you almost died for real, right? You shouldn't have acted up like that. A lackey pretending to be a tough kid. Come on. Hey, Jaewoo. Sorry about back then. About what? Putting everything on you after I transferred. I always felt bad about that. I'm sorry too. I never helped when you were being bullied then. It's late, but I apologize. That's all ancient history. This was really unexpected, though. You usually mind your own business. Which is why you were a jerk. I got tired of living like a coward. And what about you? I thought you'd run away peeing your pants. -What is this? -What? Wait. It's not... Probably not. It's not. It's not! No, it's nothing. Things must've been tough. It's okay now. It was so tough! Taewoong was right in front of me! In my pants! Dang it! -That's it... -I peed myself! Look up. One, two, three... Look. That looks good. It looks good. Why? One more. One, two, three... I must be insane. Why did I do that yesterday? I must have lost it. -Isn't that Chan? -It is. Dang it... Aren't you going to school? -No. -Alright. No! I'm going with you! Hurry up. I'm really scared! I'm dead meat now. Chan. Why are you carrying these? You'll get tired. Chan, I bet you're sleepy. Let's get to class and take a nap. Come on. -Yes. -Let's go! Here comes His Royal Highness! Move it. Step aside. -Chan... -Yes? Now I know why you don't fight often. Your punches... ...were a work of art. That power and speed. I had no idea where the punches came from. I feel ashamed. Forgive me for underestimating your skills. I'm sorry. Yes. Well... It happens. I forgive you. Mercifully. Taewoong, your fist... ...let's let it rest. True... ...friends. I did it. (11th grade top dog Jo Taewoong equals Kang Chan) (7 days before transferring) You guys hear? Jo Taewoong beat the tar out of these kids from another school. Their arms and legs were broken... What? There's a really tough new kid coming from Seoul? He won 17-to-one? What a scary world we live in! Bang! Bang! That looks pretty real. Are you okay? I said to take it easy, boy. This is a new shirt. Now what? Just lie down here? Yes. I'm sorry, but I'm going to need you to put this on. But I already drew these on. Use this too? Why am I even doing this? This feels weird... Yuck... What happened? It's been released again. Once the new top dog was established, there were no lackeys in our school at all until the day I graduated. Chan, I thought you don't snack. Oh, I quit being a fighter. It's a very lonely life. Now that lackeys are gone, someone gave Chan this nickname. The Legendary Lackey. Minsu, what are you doing? Let's get going. Yes, let's go. (Lackey log done!)
