So what is going on? I was just telling her that she should stop being rude to your gateman. It's not nice. He's a human being. I just asked a simple question, I mean what was the problem? That's the problem. Or isn't that a problem? Wait. So you mean my two pretty friends here, are actually arguing over my gatekeeper? An ordinary gatekeeper? That dirty idiot... That stupid old man at my gate? - Really?! - Princess, thank you. Did you hear that? An ordinary gatekeeper. In fact, a local, a dirty and a stinking one for that matter. That's what she's arguing about with me my princess. - I just think people should be treated... - Matilda. You know what, let me be on my way. So you are leaving because of an ordinary gateman? Okay, no problem. You can go. No, because I have an NGO to run madam. Babe, I need your support. You know my Tilda Goes Green Foundation is having an event on Saturday. We'll basically be planting trees, you know, sensitizing everyone on how to keep their environment you know, healthy. And… that's where you come in. Mm. I'll try, just because you're my friend.

We pray the gods to keep you alive and healthy. May your days be long. Thank you, Your Majesty. Here she comes, - My princess. - I am not your princess. You will address me as Your Majesty. Address you as what? Your future queen. Yes. I am royalty, and you are my subject. You will bow down to your future queen now. What is this? Your Majesty, My King. What's the meaning of this? Um. Why don't you just grant her request as the first princess of this kingdom, so we can continue with the day's business. Your Majesty. Good, now you can proceed. Your Majesty, Our princess. Thank you for honoring our invitation. We summoned you here to discuss the future of Okirika. Which beholds and lies on you. Get yourself a husband, bear fruits, so that you can perpetuate the lineage of the king. That's why we summoned you. This is the reason you summoned me? You have no business with my private life. I mean each and every one of you here. I only owe my father, the king, my explanations. And of course my mother the queen. Next time, when you gather yourselves together like rats, do not sunmon me. Because I have better things to do. I beg to leave, father. Excuse me. My King, what's the meaning of this? Unbeliveable. What an insult. My King, what's happening? Long live Akwa Ibom! A lot of young good-looking progressive men, have come to seek your hand in marriage. You're not even good enough for the beggars on the street, not even for my maidens. Some of them princes, and you have consistently turned all of them down. Prince Uduak Ebo, save yourself further embarrassment, and get these lousy, bloody idiot animals, - out of this palace. - God, please. What exactly is wrong, tell me. Like I said, good-looking young men, from well-appointed homes, still, is it that you have not found in any of them what you want in a man? What is the problem? - Dad, - Mm-hm. I… I really do not know want I want in a man, but I know when I see one, I will definitely know it. And your princess here promises to make you proud someday. By getting married and giving you grandkids. I mean beautiful ones. You just said you'll get married someday. - Yes daddy. - That's not good enough. Tell me you'll be married soon. I'm not getting any younger as you can see. We're so late. These people are calling me silly. - Yeah. - Prince Uloma. How are you? I'm prince Leonard of Ogwachi kingdom. Oh prince Leo! - I've heard so much about you. - Thank you, how are you sir? - Very fine thank you, Prince Sontoye. - Nice to meet you. ‪My pleasure. - Can we go inside, please? - Of course, please. - So, er, how's the day been? - Oh, not bad, we're just late. Big changes start with small steps. Our foundation, with the help of many volunteers, who also care about the enivornment have been able to plant ten thousand trees, equivalent to the inhibition of 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide. The protection of our environment should be our concern. Un-marked in the middle. Goal! Six-one. Six-one! Guy, yeah I know I beat you but, not this bad what's happening? - My mind is not here man. - Your mind is not here. Is it about the girl you met at the tree planting event? She's not just a girl, she's a princess. Mm. Mm-hm. Tell me something. I feel we share a very strong connection, we should be in each other's lives. My guy is in love. Guy. So do you plan on expressing yourself to her or you're just gonna drown in it? Well, I thought of telling her that day, but it was quite a busy day for her. I believe we'll see again. I believe so. I pray you do my friend. I pray you do. But in the meantime, collect that pad and receive beating. Receive beating. Goal! Guy, seven-one bro! Guy, even if it's basketball. Get out. So I've met with the port authority to see how we can make this happen with my company. But those guys, I don't, I don't know, it's like… Anyway, it seems the only way we can make this happen, is through the president's connection. And getting the president's connection is quite hard. - You know, you are an ambitious man. - Yeah. But I must tell you, ah… - It is a viable project, and I like it. - Thank you. I mean I… I am prince Leonard. You see, the funny thing here is, at the moment, the, the President needs my support in concluding a state project, and er, you need my support. And I'll give you my support. Yes. I'm going to get you in a room with the President. Yes. I'll get you in a room with President Buhari. And um, it's left to you to close the deal. Oh wait, I need to know, who is this man that you're talking about? Who is he? Prince Leonardo. - Leonardo. - A prince. Mm-hm. He appears to be so overconfident, somewhat arrogant, Mm-hm. A little bit handsome. Mm-hm. I hate him. - You do. - It's a done deal. ‪-She hates him. ‪-Sounds to me you like him. - She really hates him. - In fact, I think you're already in love. What? Did I say anything wrong? You've practically been talking about this prince since you - came in here. - Hold on. - She doesn't like him. She likes Tobi. - Who does she like then? - Which one is Tobi again? - Tobi. - Princess, you are hot oh, only you? - I'm telling you, not this prince. - Princess. One princess, - She's on fire. Ah, my God. - Twenty thousand men on the ground. - Oh lord! Princess teach us, we're your friends, teach us. - Are you going to teach us the way? - Teach us. Help us.

Are you, are you having fun so far? Yes we are. - Ha-ha. - Okay. Um, maybe we should get another bottle of this? - What do you say? - Ah, I'm okay. I can't handle this glass. Princess.

It won't kill you, please help them. Get up, they can't lift you up. - Easy. - I'm not drunk. Princess. Where was she? And what were you staring at while she was drinking? - What... - Good morning beautiful. You are kind of a party freak. Leave me alone! You shouldn't be screaming. It's only gonna give you a headache. See, you had a lot to drink last night. I can take it away. All of it. But you would have to kiss me first. I don't want your drugs. But you can have my kiss. I'm all the calm you need. Good afternoon princess. - We've been expecting you. - Oh great. This way please. So this is officially our first date. I must say you… You look gorgeous tonight. Thanks for the compliment. You're not looking bad yourself. Oh wow. The princess compliments me. That's a first. To the future. Come towards us! I've thought about this over and over again. Looking at you now, I just know that life would be more beautiful with you by my side. I want you to be my queen. Will you marry me? Yes. Oh my God, this is too cute. It's beautiful. - Your Highness. - Ah, Leo my son. I see you have become hand in glove with my daughter. Well, if this is love, I hope it's mutual. Your Highness I… I just want to see her happy. I see, I hope she feels that way towards you. Yes daddy. So, when are we expecting to hear the wedding bells? Your Highness I… I would've wished for tomorrow, but um, I believe, as… as soon as possible. - With your blessings of course. - Very true. So I can now safely assume that you love each other enough to get married? Yes... Yes daddy. Alright. Come. Well, to be honest, my princess, he's not a bad match. Ah, uh uh. He is not my type. - He's tall, good-looking, rich. - He doesn't have enough money. Mm? This car is not washed? Kala! - Kala! My friend would you run down here. - Ma!

Everything will be fine. - Alright? - But you know it's all your fault right? It's all your goddamn fault. You just had to let her leave in that state, knowing that she was overdosed. Come on baby again. - Who am I to stop her? - Why didn't you, that's the question! Why didn't you stop her?! You just watched her leave, knowing she was overdosed! - Where is she? - Yeah, she just got up and left. - She just left? - Yeah. Babe, why would you let her go like that? What the hell is wrong with you! How would I know she wouldn't handle a little sleep? Little, a little sleep? - She seemed fine. - By the way, how many pills was in that? Two. - Two pills. - Yeah, come on. Well, you overdosed her! And you stood there, and watched her leave in that state! It's your fault! - 'Cause, you asked me to do it. Yes. - Oh, now it's my fault, right? Now you sit down there and point fingers at me. - Oh, please. - We are about to lose so much ‪money because of you! All you should've done was just sit down there and watch her! What the fuck is wrong with you! I was drugged? And what is it I hear about the princess? I'm asking both of you, what is it I hear about the princess? Is it really true that… she's in coma? Ah! My God, the wedding. Ah. The business. - What do we tell our partners? - Let me think. - Let me think. - O.K. There must be a solution to this. So what do we do? All she had to do was just wait few days before crashing into the bloody car. By now, we'd be married and that document would be signed. You know. She had to just go crash. Stupid, stupid bitch. What do we do? We must get King Dagogo to sign that document. Or we could kidnap him. Yes, let's kidnap him. That's a very dumb idea. Or do you think Dagogo is stupid or as dumb as his stupid children? - Are we now kidnappers? - It's just a thought, okay? Look, we kidnap him, we make him sign the document, and we kill him. You wait for your princess to wake up, you get married to her, seal your rights and that's it. Very clever, but still very dumb. - I'll marry the princess. - That vegetable? Exactly. I'll marry the vegetable. I mean, what other way can you prove your love, than getting married to a vegetable. This's what you're gonna do. You're going to call Dagogo, and tell him that the wedding plans remain as normal. - Okay. - You're going to call elder Vincent, and elder Louis and inform them about the change in plans. That document has to be signed at all cost. All bloody cost. You will not get away with this. I promise you. It's alright, it's okay. She'd be alright. But how can she be? It's been five days. - There's no movement, no sign of life. - I know. It's... It's a trying period, and we'll get over it. She'd be okay. She'd be alright. Pull yourself together, I know she'd be alright. We have not harmed anybody, so we have no cause to feel that she won't be alright. - She will be. - Look mom, Mom? Mom, I'm right here with you. Mom, can't you see me? Mom, I'm right here with you, stop crying. By the way, prince Leonard wants us to give him our blessings to proceed with the bridal rites. Do we proceed or not? Um, I think we don't really have much of and option. Um… I have seen the young man Leonardo, and I think he's a respectable human being. I think our daughter was lucky to have engaged his attention, so if you ask me… I'd like him as a son-in-law so, - No, dad. Daddy, no - I think they should - go ahead with the arrangements. - Daddy, he's not respectable. He's not. He's a monster, dad. Daddy, please don't let him. No, you can't go ahead. - Daddy, please. - Oh Boma. - Don't go ahead with it. - Boma would be alright. There's a possibility that, while we're even making the marriage arrangements, - she'll wake up. - Oh, that would be awesome. Sontoye. Sontoye, pull yourself together. I'm not dead. Sontoye. Sontoye, I'm here behind you. Oh, God. Sontoye, please - Matilda my darling. - Babe. Mm. Um, please, can I get a plate, and a glass of wine, thank you. You've never called me darling before, so what's the good news? - You've not heard? - Heard what? You've not heard the gist about our beloved princess. Ooh! I heard she got engaged. - I'm so happy for her. - Yeah, that's not it. This is even a juicer thing. So what's the juicy gist? She overdosed. Thank you. She overdosed? On what now? On crack now, ah-ah. Ah-ah. I'm surprised at you. Why are you asking me all these unnecessary questions? Wait, Boma? But that is not even the main gist. Talk now, let me continue my food. What is it? The crackhead got into a ghastly motor accident. - Jesus! - Uh uh. As we speak right now, she's in a coma, she's laying like a dead piece of vegetable. Wait, Boma is in a coma? So why you smiling? Why won't I be smiling? No, tell me, why won't I be happy about it? Why aren't you happy? After all she did to you? This is Boma we're talking about. Our friend. - Our princess. - Uh uh. Our friend maybe, but definitely not my princess. She's not my princess. Who did she help? Did she help you? She helped you? Everyone is literally so happy about this. It's like a burden has been lifted off their shoulders. Nemi, leaving your own business for you. Are you not going to eat again? Did you pay for the food? ‪ Hello doctor, please I'm here to see the princess, Boma. Um, sorry we're not allowed to let anyone in, she's reacting. Oh my God. Sorry, you said? We can't let anyone in. Wait, I know you. - Yeah, Tobi. - Tobi. Oh God. Would she ever make it out? I don't know. I wonder where she is right now. How do you start the day, without washing your face to see and clear road. - You are a ghost! - Kala, stop screaming, I'm not a ghost. You are a ghost. I'm not a ghost. Yes... Kala, please I'm not a ghost. You need to help me. Please, what has the living got to do with the dead? What has light got to do with darkness? Kala. I know you're scared, I am too. I... Don't kill me now! Don't kill me now, I know locking the door doesn't matter, - You can pass through the door. - Kala, why would I want to kill you? Please, this is how people get killed in films. Anytime a ghost appears to somebody, it is either it slap the person, the person would have generational deaf and dumb, - or the person will just die! - Kala, I'm not a ghost. I won't kill you. I just need you to help... Help me to save this kingdom. Please. Kala please, you're the only one that can help me, please. - This... - You need to save this kingdom. That thing now, it look like film talk. Why are you talking like this now? A useless person like me, come to help you, a princess. High up there, and not just an ordinary princess. Kala, you're not useless. - A ghost princess?! - Kala, you're not useless. And you're the only one that can help me save this kingdom, please. - Don't look at me! - Look the other way. Look the other way, face the ground. Your eyes look like fire. See, you say you're not a ghost right? You say you're real and this experience is not a dream, right? You say… you say... But I want to ask one question, why are you here now? Are you omnipresent? Aren't you in the hospital? What's happen here? Kala, I don't know what is happening, I don't even know what I'm doing here. But, I just need you to please save this kingdom for me. - And you're the only one who can do this. - I can't help you oh. I don't know how I want to do and help a ghost oh. Kala, please. Prince... Elders of Okirika, I greet you. You're welcome, we greet you too. You see, my elders and I came here because of the urgency of the situation on ground. - Yes you're welcome. - Let's get straight to the business. - Alright. - This is where you come in. I'm going to be slipping in documents into the wedding certificate. - Okay. - And then you need ‪King Dagogo to sign those documents. Hmm. That's interesting. I don't want to know how it's gonna be done, but it has to be done. He has to sign those documents. This is the only reason why we are having this wedding in the first place. Yes, I know. Now my partners from China will be coming in. They are waiting for my approval for this thing to kickstart. And in forty days time, missionaries would be landing here. So you can see the urgency on ground. - Forty days. - That's interesting. All I want to know, is are we on the same page? Yes we are, we're on the same page. And I assure you, that it's done. We have a king who cannot control the kingdom. Look at what the daughter is doing everywhere. - That's achievable. - Desecrating our land. - Achievable my prince. - Very achievable. - Well, - My inlaws. - I guarantee you one day, - Cheers to the victory. As far as I'm concerned, ‪-You are all, ‪- we have a deal. - Going to be rich men, after this. - Exactly. Let's get it. - He's a good prince. - He's a good one. My inlaws, this your brother… ‪This your brother can ‪enjoy himself so much. Sigh. Kala. Mm. This screaming is not going to help us. - You're the only one who can see me - What is it now? And you're the only one who can help me save this kingdom. Please, I've left the palace, this is my personal house! Leave me! - Have mercy on me! - Kala. Yes? If you don't help me, you will hang. Help me. What's happen? You have asthma? - I am confused. - Kala, please. Kala please, if you don't help me, the Okirika kingdom would be reduced to nothing. In your chest? How do I help a ghost that have asthma? - Kala, please. - Okay! Okay. - Is it that serious? - Yes it's very serious. My people, I greet you all. - My inlaws, I greet you. - Thank you. My King. I greet you. - I greet you, My Majesty. - Thank you. We have successfully performed the other rites, but what is remaining is the most important one. Which is the agreement between the two royal families. My King, I've gone through the agreement, and I would advise, as your special adviser, that we proceed with the signing. I greet you, Your Majesty. Well, at this point, I should say welcome to all of you as my inlaws. Now that my special adviser as recommended that I sign the document, there is nothing else to wait for. Let me have the documents please. My parents and brother are blinded by Leonard's deception. But I know someone, who will do anything for me right now. Please, Kala, you have to go to him now. - Wait! Wait, your Highness, wait. - Excuse me it's a very important issue. - I need to see the king. - No, no. - We're almost through, just hold on. - What's the meaning of that? I need to speak to the king. Your Highness! I need to speak with you. - I need to speak with you. - Wait. - Your Highness, please I... - Elders, as elders. Come. Young man, do you realize you've just interrupted a very serious royal exercise? - Exactly! - Who are you? Your Highness, I need you to please go through these documents properly, - before you sign. - Why is that? Because you're a scam! How dare you call me a scam. How dare you call me a scam! - You're a scam! You're a fool! - Who are you to come here, ‪tell me who I am! Take him out of this place! Wait! Alright! - Your Highness he's a scam! - Throw him out of this place! I said it's alright! Hold on! Wait! - Come this way. - Your Highness, we cannot listen ‪to a stranger like this! Go on, let me hear you. This document states that you have willed the entire kingdom of Okirika, to this thief! That is a lie Your Highness. - Full-blown liar! - It states that all the lands, oil, and every treasure that would be found on this land in the future, are his. - That's a lie! - Give me my glasses. Lie! This is lie! Liar! Your Highness, this young man is a meddlesome interloper. - I can't advise you... - Unfortunately My King, the princess as signed as a witness, so has prince Sontoye. Elder vincent, Barrister Privie and a couple of others. Your Majesty, one more signature from you, and he has a right to everything! - We lose everything! - This boy is a liar! You're a liar! Your Highness you cannot trust a total stranger that comes here - without respect for the throne! - Can you - imagine that! - To interrupt the process! Your Majesty, I'm your adviser, I can't deceive you. Lock that door! Quickly. Tiger, make sure none of them escapes. All of you, come this way, come this way! Come this way! ‪ ‪- I said all of you come this way! ‪-l need to explain Your Highness sir. Your High... ‪-Don't touch me! ‪- ‪ ‪-Kala come! ‪-Small small! - Where are we running to now? - Just keep coming. - Where are we running to now? - I need to get back to my body. Why are you always reminding me of the fact that I take stupid decisions. Where are am I running to now? - Time is precious, Kala let's go. - Ooh! Wai… wait… wait! I is... Why am I even running with you! Why don't you just appear! Appear like the ghost that you are. And cut the cost of ‪-transportation and energy! ‪-Kala! I'm not a ghost! But I would be if I do not get back to my body in the next few minutes. If you're not a ghost what are you? Human being... And you have whooping cough? What is this one? You're not a ghost... Let's go! Get in, you're not a ghost, you're not a real human being. What are you then? ‪-What kind of thing is this! ‪-Come in! Who gave you asthma on the other side? Keep driving! Drive! Be fast! Sir, who are you talking to? Don't let me fight you! - Sorry. - Sorry for yourself. ‪ I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry my Elders. I'm sorry for all the embarrassment. All the insults. All the shame I've brought to this throne. They were not intentional. I did not know what I was doing. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry, please forgive me. Please forgive me, my elders. Please forgive me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They say every time you mistreat someone, you reveal the part of you that lacks love, and needs to heal. For me Boma, I didn't lack love. I just didn't let myself feel it enough to give it out. I have come to learn it, and I've learned it the hard way. That every human being of any origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must respect others even as we respect ourselves. No one is more insufferable than he who lacks basic courtesy. Let us always meet each other with a smile. For the smile is the beginning of love. Love, which in turn drives respect, friendship, forgiveness, and happiness. Many trains arrive at your station, treat them good, whether they stay, or leave. Because in life, the table always turns. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
