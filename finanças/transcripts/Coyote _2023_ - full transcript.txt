Sure, those pictures of you in Bora Bora with hubby and the gang look great. Those plastic smiles you so cleverly coaxed out with bribes of ice cream and adventure, but they lead up to that picture-perfect moment... long flights and sleepless nights snoozing upright with a flat complimentary pillow. Isn't it time to book your first teleportation holiday with Jiffy Ride, the first global company to get you from here to there in a matter of seconds. After a day of skiing the majestic slopes of the Swiss Alps, why not relax on the beautiful beaches of Maui, Mai Tai in hand? Choose up to ten stops for just Â£3,900, - or single-destination holiday-- The other day, it was a slew of illegals. Now, you take the case of unlicensed motorist Victor Suarez. Just got convicted of manslaughter after not his first, but his second traffic violation. Now, "unlicensed" in this case, means, of course, you guessed it, illegal. So when police pulled over this freeloader for running a red light back in October, that could've been the moment when Mr. Suarez was sent back home where he belonged. And if our judicial system had been functioning properly, that's exactly what would've happened. But instead, folks, a little girl is dead. Now, that's-- that's what a liberal policy of tolerance and second chances gets you. Oh, sure sounds nice to help everyone, but when the cost is the collapse of our social services and the lives of our children, and... well, it begs the question, does your government even care about your God-given rights as a citizen? Well, here with me today to debate the topic is Professor Adebiyi Jelani. Now, I know what you're thinking, folks. Not everyone with a funny name is an illegal. Adebiyi is a first-generation immigrant from Kenya whose parents went about it the right way, the legal route. Is that so much to ask? Adebiyi, your thoughts. First off, thank you for having me. But I'd like to get straight to the heart of the matter -concerning Mr. Suarez's... -Fucking coyote. The government failed to provide-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. ...with a reasonable path to-- You think this is the government's fault? I think it's a much more complex situation than we really know. Get down. Stay back. You don't belong here. This ain't your country. English. English! Learn the fucking language if you're gonna jump the border. How many more of these are there out there? Get down! Down! Back! Stay back! Listen. You-- Incoming call from Janet. Incoming call. Hello. Forgot to mention we're in the States, probably won't be back for a while. -Very nice. Uh, nice to be home? -And can you please remember to take the food out of the fridge this time? I don't want it stinking up the condo. - Very good. - Doesn't it look like she just rolled out of bed again? Stop! You're so bad. And no need to come next week. We'll let you know when it's time to restart. Hopefully the bombings will end soon. The chancellor's campaign is doing wonders for tourism. -Very good. -And don't do anything stupid. Very good. Oh, my God, babe. What's the big deal? She can't understand half the shit we're-- The UK government are still scrambling to install a series of teleport-proof barriers in various government locations which pose the highest security risk. This just days after the previous barriers failed during a historic breach in the House of Commons where five refugees were teleported in during a joint session. The recent achievements in teleportation technology, while historic and revolutionary, have left both Britain and legitimate refugees exposed and vulnerable. We sat down with the Home Secretary, Richard Baqri, to discuss the issues. You know, heritage is something that never leaves you. If my father hadn't emigrated to the UK, legally, 47 years ago, then I could easily be the one trying to do so now. I-- I think that's what qualifies me -to be the perfect empath. -"Perfect em-- empath." What is happening to these refugees is truly abominable. You hear stories of refugees paying for passage to the UK or to the United States and instead being sent -just offshore of the... -"Offshore." ...you know, drowning in the ocean. You know, human trafficking. -Terrorism. -"Terrorism." Long-term side effects when jumpers are left in limbo. What I'm proposing to do with my new plan... Hey, hon. When are you coming home tonight? I have a surprise for us. Ah. Who are you? Lev is my father. Lev sent you? Why didn't he come himself? He knows I don't like it when things don't go to plan. He said that I-- That you could... Tell Lev I don't fuck little boys. I can't afford to lose what I paid for the room. Take seat. Where is your father? Next door? He-- he wants proof. If you don't go through with this, what will he do to you? What-- what happens to everyone born perverted like me? Do you have someone special in your life? Are you in love with him? Yes. I am. Your father will be able to hear. He knows I put on a show. If he hears nothing, that won't be good for you or for I. I don't think I can go through with this. That's not what I'm saying. We don't have to do anything. Maybe make a bit of noise. Can you do that? Fuck off! Hello? Daddy. Where did you get this? You need to practice your English. Why? I got it from work. It's good. Hmm? Is it your father? Volkov. He got murdered by the police today. I saw. She always speaks to her husband in English - thinking I don't understand. - Mmm. Fancy. Pretend we are rich. What happens if we get enough for one of us to jump? Then we wait. -You're not gonna leave me? -No. Maybe I find myself a nice English girl. If you're not paying the jumper, someone else is. Anya! I've come to speak to my daughter. I know she's in there. Go away. There's no one else here. I just want to talk. Look, I brought her this. Her mother made it. It's her favorite. She doesn't want to talk to you. I've come to apologize. Please. Take it. It's for the both of you. I don't need to approve of my daughter's choices in order to love her. We have our own food. - Ekaterina! - Whoa, whoa! -Stay back. Nothing to fear. -Wait. Wait. I will take her home. Both are coming with me. This is not what we agreed. Step aside. Do not interfere. -Get down on your knees! -You cannot take my daughter! Hands on your head. Hands on your head! Cooperate. Do not resist. Did you get it? Hands on your head! Leave-- leave her alone. - Do not get involved. - Leave her alone! I'll go! Get your hands on your head! Hey! No, no, no. Hey, hey! Unauthorized entrant. Please identify yourself at the nearest control unit. Failure to register will trigger a police alarm in three minutes. Okay. Okay. Hold this. -Ow. -Shh. Shh! I know. Good, good, good. Okay. Shh! It's okay now. It's okay. Unauthorized entrant. Please identify yourself at the nearest control unit. Failure to register will trigger a police alarm in two minutes. ...for those facing religious persecution-- Isn't it true that the teleportation facility at our embassy is being used less than 20 times per day? Meanwhile, someone in the Home Office is casually flipping through the-- I-- I have to come to the defense of our wonderful workers at the Home Office. Oh, fucking hell. - ...if they make the decision... - -Change channel. ...to let the wrong person into our country, - well, that could mean life... - Change channel. ...or death to a number of-- Change channel. ...wishes to teleport into our country can do so. And thanks to the Secretary of Defense, we are reducing crime zones while still patrolling-- Richard, why don't you just come out and say it? Change channel. Change the fucking channel, you fucking arsehole! ...delaying the asylum stages for refugees is-- Shut up, you fuck! Fuck, it's cold in here! The fuck did I come here for? These babies. Let's have a look at you. Yes. Oh, there you are, you lovely beauties. All right, why don't we? Let's turn you guys on. Like you turn me on. All right. There she is. Hello, darling. You all right? Not you yet. You stay there, all right? How are you, Pipes? Don't get jealous, now. Come on, I love you all the same. Well, apart from you. You are my favorite. Shh. You're gonna make me loads of money, you are. Yeah. Let's get you in there. All right. Let's get you activated, shall we? Fuck. Who the fuck is that? Oh, fuck. Come on. Come on-- Hey, what do you want? Hey! It's the middle of the bloody night. English, English! What is up with you people? We need to leave. I operate by appointment only. You can't just bang on my door and expect a flipping miracle! We have money! Wait there. What's wrong with her? -She looks pale. -I'm fine. We just need to leave. All right, let's move then. Time is money. This ain't even half. Come on. There better be something good in here, I'll tell you. What the-- what do you think this is? -A flipping pawn shop? -Please. Do you think jumping your arse to the promised land -is 100% profit on my end? -Please! Quit with the fuckin' please, all right? -They will kill us. -That's not my problem, darling. If I make it my problem-- But what happens when you girls get to the other side? You want jump to England, right? But what happens when you get there? -You got family? -No. No. Well, for two jumps to the UK at this price, I'm operating at a loss. It means not only am I not making any money, but I'm spending money. So the way I see it, you got two options. They will kill us. Please. You got two fucking options! Look, do you even understand how this technology works? It's all about distance, right? Look, if I jump you from one side of the room to the other, that's cheap. Now, I just walk over here, all right? Put this down, and bam, you're there. Cheap as chips. Of course, receivers are single use. So I'm out about 100 quid. But if I gotta jump your arse halfway around the world, well, that takes a million bits of admin to make it happen. We gotta smuggle receivers across multiple borders or find some geezer with the technical know-how to replicate one of these bad boys in the country that you wanna go. You follow? Bottom line is, it's expensive. It's a fucking ball ache and I don't do it for free. Oh, don't pull that shits on me, all right? Go on, shoot me. Shoot me, go on! See how far that gets you. Um, why do some flash red and some green? Green ones are ready to jump, all right? But there's no way you're smuggling a live one across the border. Red means they're locked, and unless you've got the code to make 'em go green, there's no turning up at point B. Capiche? Lucky for you, I got some of these just smuggled across the border. I jump you there, you're in neutral territory. You fend for yourselves, you hike it to England. Hike it to the fucking moon for all I care. Point is, it's the cheapest way to immediately mitigate your risk in this country. No. We go England. You're not both going tonight, darling. Not on my dime, all right? So, if England it is, which one of you two are going? Hmm? I jump one of you there, right? You settle in, you make some money, yeah? And I jump the other one in a few months' time. Hello? Ladies? Come on, time's money. Who will be on the other side? Orla Miller! Hey, babes, you all right? Vas. It must be late there. Yeah, you know how it is. No rest for the wicked. Look, I know it's unscheduled, but you've got, uh, capacity for a jump coming your way tonight? Oh, you poor thing. Yeah, she, uh-- she needs to raise some funds and hopefully bring over a friend in a few months' time. I told her you might be able to sponsor a stay at your safe house. Yeah, absolutely. You remember Mr. Green? Well, a generous donation came in from him just this morning. Fantastic. All right, I'll send them over. Give 'em a good spank when they get there. All right, darling? Welcome. It's all right. All right, let me get you some water. Here. Here you are, my dear. That's all right. Take your time. Can I call home? Yeah. You have plenty of time for all that. For now, just try the bath. It's nice. I promise. Oh, God, what happened here? Did you make the dump whilst wounded? Did Vas not warn you of the damage that could cause? -I need to take-- -No! No, it could cause an infection. No. Well, the bathwater's gonna soak right through that dressing. Let's run you a shower. Stay in here as long as you like. You deserve it. Ah. Good morning, weary traveler. How did you sleep? -Good. -You hungry? I'm just having something light. Berries, nuts, yogurt. Fancy? Yes, thank you. The other girls are still asleep. It's quite early, but probably not for you. The jump lag will wear off in a few days. Oh. Tea, coffee? Everyone does their bit around here. You'll learn that. But for now you get the royal treatment. Yeah, we just take turns cooking meals. It's fair that way, you know? To be honest, in rescuing strays from four corners of the Earth, the diversity of food cooked in this kitchen is to die for. Mexican one night, Thai the next, Indian. Oh, what's your favorite dish? I'll see if we can't whip it up for you tonight. Anything is fine. No, no, it's no bother. I want you to rack your brains. Place your order by midday just so I can make sure we have the right ingredients. How many people do you help? Oh, gosh. Must be over 50 women by now. Yeah. You're just one of five here at the moment, though. Let me see your hands. Oh, these are in a right state. Oh, relax. You'll enjoy it. People pay good money for this. Right. Do you have a favorite color? Black. Black's not a color. It's the absence of color. Oh, well, we do have this black little number here, but I'm not sure you'll have much use for it yet. We'll have to find you a dashing English boyfriend first. I think it's best to start practical. Ah. Now, what you need is a big hug, and this looks like a big hug. You could nestle up with a cup of tea and a book. Do you read in English? -Yes. -Good. That'll help you assimilate and find work. But no rush on that, mind you. Plenty of time yet. I'd like to start work right away. Well, most of the work available to girls in your situation isn't anything glamorous. What did you do back home? I was maid. Oh, that'll explain the state of your nails. All that bleach and what have you. Gosh, it dries out the skin. You know, we had a girl here a little less than a year ago, she was a maid. Moved on now, though. I'd be happy to be your first customer. You give me bed. I can't charge you. But maybe if you like my work, you recommend me to your friends. Don't be silly. I'm happy to pay. Is Â£1000 a month all right? Ah, let's make it 1200. I'm sure you're just what this house needs. Okay, uh, try these on, and if anything doesn't fit, just let me know, I'll get you something else. Oh, God. You gave me a fright. Can I get you anything? I'd like to call home. Ah, shoot. The internet's down, I'm afraid. I'm just working offline, but I'll be sure to let you know when it's back up. Where are your cleaning products? Oh, don't worry about that now. Just make yourself at home. What's another few days of dust? Tara, this is Ekaterina. She'll be doing the cleaning around here. Tara's our resident masseuse. She's been with us for quite a few months now. Haven't you, Tara? Well, you know your way around. Maybe you could show her some of the amenities? I prefer to leave it on. Turn around. So... how much Orla pay you, girl? Hmm? 1000 sound about right. No... make it 1200. That old bitch, always up to the same old tricks. Turn over. You try to bring somebody over? - No. - Mmm. I don't believe you. Everybody try to jump somebody over. You know, I heard about your country. You're not the first refugee I've met. Maybe, you know, your sister, you try to bring over. Hmm? Maybe your girlfriend. You know... I know faster ways you can make money other than cleaning house. You heard me, girl. Mmm! Thank you, Chyou, for tonight's cuisine. Say thank you, girls. What is this? An English boarding school? And welcome to the new addition of our family, Ekaterina. Now, Kat-- Can I call you Kat? This is fine. Kat may just be scrubbing toilets around here, but remember, everyone in this house is equal. You're to treat her with the proper respect. No excuses not to pick up after yourselves. Tidiness shows courtesy to others in the house. Is wine not enough for you, Tara? Such displays of excess will be reflected in your monthly contribution. Oh, girls! Is this how you're gonna treat Kat on her first night? Is not problem. It's nearly curfew. Go to bed, the lot of you. -Here, I've got this, love. -I'd like to help. No, no, no, no. I got it. You enjoy this time. You won't be the new girl forever. Can I get you something to drink, Ambassador? Oh, yes. Uh, snakebite? If you-- if you have. Yes, that's not a problem. Uh, I'll be completely honest, I'm new to this experience. Is, uh, every masseuse the same price? Well, what did you have in mind? I mean, everything's available for a price, right? Trouble sleeping last night? Come in. Sit. You probably have some questions. It is none of my business. Oh, don't be silly. This is your home for the time being, and everyone has a right to know what goes on inside their own four walls, don't you think? I wish all of my girls could be a maid like you... but who am I to judge them? I didn't see anything. You're not in trouble, Kat. As women, we're born into trouble. We don't need to make life any harder for our sisters than it already is. Some of the women who stay with me have decided for themselves that... the easiest way for them to get ahead in this life is to give men what they want. Do you understand? Life isn't kind, Kat. It doesn't give immigrants many options, illegal or not. Well, they can work themselves to death in a field or a factory and scrimp and save and skip meals and bring their family over after a decade if they're lucky. A decade of their life, gone. But take that immigrant, a woman, put her on her back in a bed, and she can make enough in a few months, and then she'll never have to give herself away again. Now, I know what my girls can be like. It just makes them feel better about themselves knowing that they're not doing it alone, you know? But I want you to know that you must never feel pressured into doing anything with your body that you don't want to do. You come here like a serpent to finesse your way into my fortune, but it's not going to work! Turn it off. This is rubbish. So how can I have an American bastard? -My mother loved you-- -Change channel. I don't care about your money. Change the channel. Change the channel! Oh, there he is! Taraji, your boyfriend is back on the telly. He come to take you away. Taraji! Come to see your sexy, sexy Mr. Green. People from the LGBTQ+ community who have found themselves targeted by the state... You remember Mr. Green? Well, a generous donation came in from him just this morning. Oh, now, George. Come on. That is below you. In this point... Let me see. Oh! Hey. Christ! There's blood everywhere. Let me see. Let me see. Jesus, what's happened? Where's Tara? Peter? She needs this looked at by a doctor. Right, for now, uh, let's, um, wrap her head. Chyou, there's gauze and bandages in the downstairs bathroom. Chyou, go! Peter? Oh, God. -Peter, get the car. -She won't be deported? Well, that's a risk she's gonna have to take, isn't it? What are you looking for there, girl? Hmm? Just seeing where things are. Sure you are. Did you hear about Marzanna? Who's Marzanna? Don't know no Marzanna. People come, people go, people kept in limbo. But you... you're here now. You going to help me with Mr. Pink? Mr. Pink? He likes his chocolate and vanilla swirl. You don't even last a year around here now. I'm just the maid. I was the maid. Chyou. Salima. Tomorrow, a new girl will jump into this house and take your place. You can fight it... but you will end up just like the rest of us. On your knees with a tiny English prick in your mouth, struggling to keep him hard. Clean this up. Oh, no. -What's happened here? -It was accident. Whose accident? She wanted help with Mr. Pink. Of course she did. Oh, the pieces of the puzzle are coming together now. They used to... service Mr. Pink together. And I have a feeling Marzanna didn't want to do it anymore, so Tara might have-- I really don't like to think that one of my girls could do this to another, but... it's not out of the realm of possibility, now, is it? How is Marzanna? You shouldn't feel any pressure. Do you? Oh, sweetheart. She's just a bully. You know, if I find out for a fact that she did do this to Marzanna, I will kick her out of this house. You don't owe her anything. I was not, um, maid in my country. Well, you did what you had to do to get out of there, didn't you? And you're here now. If I service these men, Mr. Green, how much could I make? Mr. Blue! How lovely to see you again. - Hello. - It's been a while, hasn't it? It has. Well, I've been busy, busy, you know, with the holidays and whatnot. Oh, you've brought a little something with you. Yes, I have. Well, why don't you join in the fun, my dear? Can I pour you a drink? Scotch, single malt, if I remember correctly? Oh, yes, that would be, uh, delightful. Ah. A new face, I see. Ah. Evening, ladies. Ah... I remember you, my African queen. Do you remember me? Of course you do, of course you do. Not tonight, sorry. Fond memories and everything. For the both of us, I hope. Yes... No, tonight, I think I'm rather in the mood for... sweet and sour. Shall we? Well, now, Orla. You didn't tell me there was a secret menu. Not her, not tonight, Charles. -Shh. -Oh, come off it. The girls know who you really are. We have a television. Why not? Must you be so uncouth? -Hmm? -Do I have to say it? Not all our girls are available on every day of the month. Oh, right, right. Of course, I-- Well, I'd like her to watch. I can watch. Are you sure? You don't have to. Orla, let the girl do what she wants. Ahh. Right. What new little toys have we tonight? See what we've got here, shall we? We are gonna have a lot of fun, I think, tonight. Oh, yeah. Complicated, but worth it. A little tickle. And, of course... You dirty little bitch. You're a dirty boy. Yeah, I'm a dirty boy. Yeah, I'm a dirty boy. Get down! Get down! To discuss the situation in further detail, I would like to hand it over to my colleague, the right honorable gentleman, Sir Charles Ward. Right. Uh, well, uh, I should be able -to get away later in the week. -Yeah, that's fine. You know how to book an appointment, right? Yes, yes, yes. Well, thanks again. Excellent. Oh. How are you this morning, my dear? Fine. Mr. Blue isn't the best person to ease into this lifestyle. You didn't have to agree to anything. -I've had worse. -Oh, you poor thing. He's known for being a bit heavy-handed. He wasn't too rough with you, then? I'm fine. Thank you. Last night... Usually, he tie us up. I know. Can I stay? Do we ever go to the men, or do they always come to us? Our misters come to us now. First week I here, I go to Mr. Green... but girl die. What happened? There was blood everywhere. The dead girl in Mr. Green's arms, and he yell at me to go. He say it not his fault. He say it suicide. Orla believe him, so he still come back. But no more we go to Mr. Green. No more go to anyone. What was her name? I-- I don't remember. But she was white. Like you. Do you have someone you bring over? I love it. My husband, Chyou Chiang, we have not spoke in five months. Is that how long you've been here? Why don't you call him? There is always excuse. Orla. I'm afraid to. You do something she doesn't like and she put you in limbo. Kat. Come sit. I've set you up with an English bank account. Chyou, can you give us a moment? She would like to call her husband. Oh-- It's the middle of the night there, Chyou. We'll do it later, all right? I promise. Come. Sit. This is from last night? Uh, no, I paid a month in advance for cleaning as well. But the rest is last night. Not as much as Chyou, she was your main girl, but Mr. Blue upped his price accordingly. Now, the account is in my name, but I do this for all my girls. Ask them. Ask Chyou. You two are becoming fast friends. Now, the government may not recognize it as yours, but look, the way I see it, I only have access to it for administrative purposes. I do take a portion each month for bills, but nothing excessive, as long as your behavior isn't. I don't want my girls becoming freeloaders. Smile. Smile. Good. Facial recognition activated. Now your banking details are all on the home screen, so anytime you want to access it, you just let me know. Would you like to set up a financial goal? Laundry? Everyone's got the night off tonight. Except you, Tara. I think you'll like it. Mr. Green is visiting. Chyou. What happened? Why do we not line up for Mr. Green? He always pick Taraji. He love her. What took you so long, my prince? I've missed you. Next time, don't stay away so long. Unavoidable, my dear. Oh. Good evening. Oh. Mr. Green. Please do let me know if I can ever be of... interest to you. Oh, good morning, Kat. I'm just going to go on a walkabout. Fancy joining me? I just need some fresh air, you know? I feel like this weather has got us much too cooped up. - No, thank you. - Oh, see you later. Stay away from him. Okay? He's mine. You have been in limbo too long. He's never gonna get you your own apartment. It's different with him, okay? He loves me. Then you have nothing to worry about. It won't matter what I do. Fuck! Tara! Jesus! What are you doing? - Stop it! Stop it! - No! No! Peter! Peter! Help me! Help me, Jesus. Stop it, Tara! -Stop it! -No! No! - Stop it, Tara! Christ! - No! - Peter, where are you? - Get off of me! - Tara, stop! Tara, stop it. - No! No! No, no! Girls!! Mr. Green has informed us he's no longer in need of our services. Incoming call from Orla Miller. Incoming call from Orla Miller. Incoming call from... You should be able to get at least two dozen receivers, but get more if you can. Can I stay with you? Orla put Taraji in limbo again. I heard it from my room. What do you mean? Limbo? Limbo. When you jump with nowhere to go. You get stuck 'til Orla bring you back. First time I come, Taraji in limbo, and every time she go, she come back more crazy. Good morning, Kat. Where is my money? Receivers aren't free, silly. I'm sorry, but because of Tara, we've all had to take a hit. You know, we need to stay in business. You have enough to spare, no? That's very presumptuous of you. Receivers aren't easy to come by, you know. You have powerful friends. Oh, you think those men are my friends? Am I scaring you, Kat? Good. I don't need any more of my girls giving me grief. You know, I try my best for you all and you constantly cut your noses off to spite your face. -Where is Taraji? -Oh! Fuck, haven't we all had enough of her shit? I mean, the receivers, threatening you, what she did to Marzanna. We don't know what she did to Marzanna. Who else could have done it? You know, no one even likes her anyway. No one trusts her. You know, the only reason why I kept her in this house is because one of our clients had a fetish for Black girls. You sent her away. I didn't kill her. Fuck, you girls are unbelievable. You-- I open my house to you, I feed you, I clothe you, I set you up on your business, and you fucking-- you think the worst of me! This is to protect you. It's in case she gets loose. Jesus. Orla is lying about Mr. Green. - I think he wants to see Taraji. - How do you know? I saw a message on Orla's pad, but it's locked. We need to find a way to open it. The guard. I think he is going to get receivers. Do you trust Salima? What do you want? Jesus Christ! Good evening, Orla. What's it like? Like the dream where you're being chased. You move your feet, but your feet won't move. You're-- you're thirsty, but you can't drink. Hu-- hu-- hungry, but you can't eat. You ha-- you have an itch, but you can't scratch. You can't hear anything... or see anything... or feel anything. But you're there. Just waiting with... all the time in the world. Like-- like you've been covered in stone. Mr. Green. He wants to see you. Orla was lying. I think because she found out he wanted to take you away from this place. Can he help us? Where-- where is Orla? He is coming tonight. No, no, no! No, no! Hey, what do you want? We go England. You're not both going tonight, darling. Not on my dime, all right? So, if England it is, which one of you two are going? The sooner you leave, the safer you'll be. I can hide better than you. They know who you are, because of your father and the people you clean for. If they find you, you are not getting out of here. You need to leave while you still have a chance. -You jump us both across border. -And then what? There's nothing for us there. She jumps to England. You can do it. I believe in you. I couldn't go, even if I wanted to. Fucking hell! You were gonna let me jump you like that? I need to heal before I can go. You'll do fine. Practice English until we say goodbye. Orla Miller! Hey, babes, you all right? Vas. It must be late there. Yeah, you know how it is. No rest for the wicked. Look, I know it's unscheduled, but you've got, uh, capacity for a jump coming your way tonight? Oh, you poor thing. Yeah, she, uh, she needs to raise some funds and hopefully bring over a friend in a few months' time. I told her you might be able to sponsor a stay at your safe house. Yeah, absolutely. You remember Mr. Green? Well, a generous donation came in from him just this morning. Fantastic. All right, I'll send 'em over. Give 'em a good spank when they get there, all right, darling? Ah, there she is. Fuck yeah. Ready... let us do the job. All right. All right. Okay. All right. Ready? Let's get you in the machine. Come on. Off we go. In you get. Okay, just stand there for me. That's it. Lovely. Stay inside the safe zone. Brilliant. Okay. Let's get this going on, then. Uh, missy. You wanna keep them toes, or you wanna leave 'em behind as mementos? Memen-toes, get it? I'll be right behind you. Today, ladies. Now, when you get on the other side, you're gonna feel a bit out of sorts. A bit like someone's punched you in the gut. All right? Does she understand what I'm saying? I understand. All right, okay. Bosh. Look at that go. That's a piece of art, ladies. Here it goes. That's right, ladies. And... beautiful! Look at that. Ah! Fucking amazing. Oh, dear, you poor thing. I'll get you some water. Is this who you saw in Mr. Green's bedroom? That her. I bet you're loving this. Just get it over with already. Whoa! Easy, easy. What happened to your face? What are you doing? Where is Orla? Look, they need your help too. Look, I-- I was under the impression that you were all very happy here. Were you? Of course! I have never done anything like that. I've always treated Taraji with respect. How many girls have you treated with respect? No, it's not-- it's not what you think. It-- it isn't what you think. Oh! Oh, I thought-- Ah. I don't think I can bear to think of you with anyone else. What if I got you a place of your own? Oh, God. I want to talk to Anya! I trust you! I want to talk to Anya. You said I could call her. Please, please. It's not safe here. Please. Please. Please. You need to-- to get me back. You fucking-- Oh! What have I done? Please, please. You need to-- you need to get me back. Please. Please. It's not safe here. Please. You need to-- to get me back. Richard wouldn't do that. - He wouldn't hurt anyone. - Of course not. I see you. I see blood everywhere. I did what I could for her. She might still be alive. Hey! Watch it. What? You know, you shouldn't get so possessive. It's not like she cares who's fingering her arse. It's just a pay packet. You are unbelievable. Oh, am I? And you'd still be crying into a pint about your sexless marriage if I hadn't introduced you to... Orla's lovely girls. Hey, Chyou-Chyou. Oh, you smell good. Lay a finger on her again, and I will fucking kill you. Oh, big man. That would be quite the scandal, wouldn't it? Oh, you f-- Jesus Christ, Richard, you fucking prick. She's a whore! Not your fucking daughter! Fucking hell. Ow. Let me go. What happened? I didn't mean to hurt her. -I didn't, I didn't. -Who? Who-- who have you hurt? Charles? Oh. Oh... Oh, my God, Charles. What happened? We need to help her! Oh, my love. What has he done? All I could think of was the scandal. I almost lost everything, you know. They almost traced it back to me. It wasn't my fault. I didn't have to help her, but I did. I did! Did Anya survive? How am I supposed to know that? -I'd like-- I'd like to leave. -Will you help us? I can't do anything. -Oh, God. I'd like to leave. -Please. Help us! Let me out of here! Where is Orla? What have you done with her? Where is she? What did you do? Just stay back. All of you, just stay back! What the fuck? Into the pod. One at a time. You first, Tara. Look at you. No one's ever gonna wanna fuck your infested cunt now. Not even for free, let alone for money. I wasted my time putting you into limbo. You've just-- you learned-- learned nothing. It's funny how the world comes full circle. You worked so hard to come here, and now I'm just sending you right back to where you came from. I might just spare you and send you to the ocean instead. Receivers sink, by the way. Do you know what the pressure at the bottom of the ocean does to a body? Get off me! Ekaterina.
