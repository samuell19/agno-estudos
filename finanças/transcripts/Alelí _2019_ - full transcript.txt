This is the blueprint of the house today. But this is an old blueprint. Of course it is, Mom, the house is over 50 years old. But the room your dad built in the back isn't here. Because Dad never regularized it, Mom. She's still not answering? Where is she? I don't know, Lilian. I don't have her in my pocket. -Hi, this is Silvana... -So, is this blueprint good or not? Actually, to regularize it at this point, Alba... And this is the blueprint of the real estate project that Carletti-- -"Julio," please. -That Julio will carry out once the sale and the demolition of the house are completed. Good evening. Have you started yet? -Don't you know how to answer your phone? -Hi, Mom. -What? -Don't you know how to answer your phone? My phone died. -Honey, move those folders and sit down. -Sure. I don't know why I thought you had asked for this time slot. I couldn't find the house, sorry. Right, I can imagine. It's the fifth time we meet here. Ernesto brought me here the other times, okay? -I said I could pick you up. -Estela... Can I plug in my cell phone somewhere? It's dead. Yes, there's a power strip down there. -Can we continue? Now that we're all here. -Please, go on. Where were we? So... "...sale and demolition, the sellers will receive," that's you, "the agreed payment as follows: 134,000 U.S. dollars in cash plus one of the units to be built. The closing will occur once the construction work is finished." -Okay? Is everything fine? -Which unit will we get? -Number three, Mom. -Number three? -But they're all the same! Aren't they? -Exactly. -How will we know? -Exactly, Mom. What's the difference? -They're all the same-- -It will be the nicest one, ma'am. When you see it, you'll fall in love with it. -Can we move onto the contract? -Yes, please. "On the one hand, Alba Sosa de Mazzotti, widow of Alfredo Mazzotti, owner of 50% of the property, and Mrs. Lilian Alba Mazzotti Sosa, married to Eduardo Fagundez, owner--" Wait! What does Eduardo have to do with it? -This is an inheritance, right? -Easy, dear. This is just stating the marital status. Cristina's name is also here. "Married to Mr. Eduardo Fagundez, owner of 16.66%, Mr. Ernesto Alfredo Mazzotti Sosa, married to Mrs. Cristina Romanelli, owner of 16.66%, and Mrs. Silvana Elena Mazzotti Sosa, -single--" Single, right? -Single, yes. "They commit to selling the property to Mr. Julio Maria Carletti for the amount of one hundred and thirty--" Shit, a blackout. It's not only here. It's the whole block. I think this light is good enough for signing, right? It's not! I haven't printed the document yet. I haven't even finished reading out the contract. -Okay. -Well, if it's impossible, it's impossible. We'll meet some other time. I came from Maldonado for this, Mazzotti. -And I was on time. -Almost everyone was on time. Let's see, Carletti, we're not spending the night here. Mom, we're leaving. Grab your glasses. Silvana, I'll give you a ride. -I cycled here. -Can't we wait for a minute? Maybe the power will be back. Your hair looks nice. Did you go to the hairdresser? Wait, what's this? -Is this still stuck here? -Don't try to get it out, it works. Mom, if this cassette has been there for years and it won't come out, it's broken. I sat for half an hour in the hall. Edinson offered twice to call a taxi. You could have waited for me upstairs. Why did you come down? Since you said you were coming at nine, I was ready at nine, so I came down. What did you want me to do at home? Get bored? Silvana, why don't you ever answer the phone? I already know it. The day something happens to me, the one person I shouldn't call is you. Okay, Mom, you're right. Okay, I'm late, I'm sorry. I apologize. -Okay? -Yes, right. "Forgive me. You're right." Someday you and I are going to have a conclusive conversation. What are you doing now? -Come on, I'm listening. -What's that? If it's going to be conclusive, I'll record you. Does this record? Does this record? -Go ahead. -No, no, don't be silly, Silvana. Don't be silly. Get that off my face, please! -No? -Don't upset me. -We'll have it some other time, then. -Yes, some other time, yes. -Oh, this... -I am not immortal. You and your siblings will regret it when I'm gone. -Hi. -Now she picks up. Wait. Wait a second. Silvana! Where are you going, Silva--? Silvana! Don't... But... What are you doing? Stop! What are you doing, Mom? Stop! Stop, Mom! Oh, no! -What happened? -I don't know. -Are you okay, ma'am? -Mom! -Mom, are you okay? -What happened? Mom, open up! Are you hurt? Are you hurt? Can you open the door? They were in the emergency room, Ernesto. She sounded very nervous. Can you tell me what Mom said? Not what you thought she sounded like. When you told me that it was all settled, I thought you would be the one going there. Not that you were going to send Silvana. Okay, but she's the one that went. Let's see, Lilian, did you volunteer? Answer the question. It's not about that, Ernesto. Wanker! Don't you see the sign? What are you doing, Lilian? Can you shut up for a minute? You upset me and I hit the car in front of me! COME TALK TO US What do we do? Should we go against your insurance or mine? Well, Eduardo is going to kill me. Erna! -Son! What happened to you? -Nothing, Mom, nothing. How are you? What did the doctor say? -You can get off the bed. -Mom! Did they take an X-ray? -Who was your doctor? -Please! You're exhausting! -One at a time! Can you please tell me--? -An ER doctor saw her, we're waiting for the traumatologist. But what happened? Were you there when the doctor came? Yes, I've been with Mom since this morning. Then why did she want to drive the car on her own? Wasn't she alone? Did you take anything, Mom? What did they give her? -Can you please keep your arm still, sir? -Why does your arm hurt, son? It's nothing, Mom, don't worry. I'm fine. -I'll go check on him, okay? -What do you mean--? -Relax! -I can't relax, Silvanita! -Look at the state these two are in. -What happened to you? Does it hurt? Nothing. Ask your sister. But what is it that hurts, son? Why isn't anyone telling me? Why did you let her drive? What the hell did you think you were there for? Enough is enough. Does it hurt right there? Where's the car? In the garage. Edinson was going to get it. Did Edinson see you two? Yes. Of course. Silvanita, go change now! What do you mean "change"? I'm already changed! -She's leaving. -Let Silvana go change, I am fine. -How could I leave? -Yes, Silvana, go change, we can stay. -Is there something wrong with me? -She's leaving, Mom! Are my clothes inappropriate? No, the lights are the biggest problem, those plastic parts are very expensive. Because this, everything... The bumper here... -This-- -It's okay, Edinson, I'll take care of it. -Thank you. -Oh, before you go... Hold on. Here. There you go. MAZZOTTI AUTO REPAIR The worst part was the scare, but these things can be fixed. It's no big deal. Listen to me, Mom. Have you lost your mind? What did they say? Look at me! -They said you can't drive anymore! -Don't talk to me like that! -Lilian said I can! -Lilian can kiss my ass! Give me that. The key is upside down, Mom. We discussed this too, didn't we? As if things weren't bad enough... Now people think I have to ask for permission for everything. Come on, Mom, go change, we're leaving. Have some fritters. I don't want any, I want you to hurry up. Eat them, they're Swiss chard fritters, I made them for you. Lilian wants to talk to you about Aleli?. She thinks it's best to do the paperwork with Sandra's mom. Who the fuck is Sandra? Does she also want to raffle off the house? If we're going to do such a mess, let's go with Estela. We can trust her. What's with all these tea towels? Are you setting up a shop? They are for Lilian. Don't you want to bring her some toilet paper too? Do you always have to talk to me that way? She is my daughter! Don't I have the right to help her, poor thing? She is 56 years old, Mom! Do you think she needs you to buy her tea towels? Well, I'd forgotten that you basically have only one child. No, I was going to buy you some too, but you never know with Cristina. I don't have a key to your house, and I don't want one either. Nothing happened. How did you hear about it? Silvana told Caro, and Caro told me. Son, come help me. With this thing they put on me I can't-- Just a second, Mom, I'm talking to Cristina. I'll pick you up in 20 minutes. No, aren't you coming here to change? I still need to take a shower. Still, Cristina? Will we ever be able to get to places on time? Okay, Ernesto, I've spent all morning making crepes. You either wait for me to take a shower or you go on your own. -What pancakes? -The ones that Lilian asked me to make. -Talk to your sister. -Ernesto, come here, please. Coming. Let's see, Mom, where's the fire? No, it's fine, Ernesto, don't come. I can manage on my own. Keep talking to your wife. Let's see what you managed to do on your own. Come here. Be careful with this fabric. It's very nice, but it creases easily. Done. Shoes too. -What's this? -Your sister. Her therapist told her to get a hobby. She gave me so many of these, now I have to store them in my closet. No, no, no. Not these ones. The gray ones. -These? -Yes, these ones. Very good. Thank you, son. -Cristina! -Mom, what are you doing? Cristina... Leave me. Cristina, come here, darling. I don't want to get in the way of you two. No, don't worry about it, we're late. -Hello. -Honey. -Grandma. -Hi, dear. -Oh, my child... -How are you? Stop, Ernesto. Didn't you have anything with sleeves to wear? -Can you relax, Mom? -I can do it. -In this heat? -Of course, darling. With such lovely skin... Your grandfather used to say-- Caro, did you show your new tattoo to your grandma? She's going to love it. Show her. If one of us were to ask Jesus, "Who is my fellow man?", what would he answer? He would remind us that the most important answer that we need to seek is this one: now, here, to whom can I be a good Samaritan? This is something that very few understand as well as our dear neighbor, Alfredo Mazzotti. That is why... I invite you to take a moment in today's service... to remember some of his words. -Put it on. -"Yamandu," he told me one day... "do you see that building they are building?" Sit here, I saved you a sit. "Of course I see it," I said. -I thought you weren't coming. -Months of works... -There are no more seats available. -How could we not come? -Who was supposed to bring Mom, then? -Come on, Ernesto. He continued, "Faith is like the foundations of that building. If its foundations are strong, the building will be tall. And that one, my friend, is going to be a 14-story building." Unfortunately he didn't live to see the finished work. But the important thing is that the foundations that he left behind, his family, who is here with us today, is standing strong and firm. We are talking about a man of impeccable values, a man with a great, profound, unbreakable Christian vision. No! She's awful! She was in your class... -I like English... -English is great! Camila's private tutor is awful. She treats you like... No, it's not true. I love you a lot, that's why... Hi, you have reached Silvana. Leave a message. Yes, but she was nice to her students. Oh, how adorable. You don't like him. Right, Fio? Get off, would you? Take your feet off the couch. Sneakers aren't allowed on the couch. Grandma's going to get angry. Look at my brother-in-law, how kind. Irina, please. Maru, give me my cell phone! -No! -Stop it with that cell phone! You're on your phone all the time! -Give it to me! -Sh-- Share! Be careful with that glass table, it's dangerous. Let your sister use it! Go, get out. Use the ones from the set! -Great, come on, another one... -What did we say about the table? Do you think she wants her own set or Grandma's? Mom, your set or Grandma's? -Grandma's! -What's Grandma's set doing here? I don't know, Uncle. Ask her. -Grandpa, did you see what I did? -Yes, honey, very nice. Very nice. Uncle, did you see what I did? -Very good! Up, up. No hands. -Yes! Oh, Uncle, don't do that, it makes her sick. -Nonsense. -Uncle, did you see what I did? -A cheap piglet for sale! -Uncle, put me down. ...watering the bougainvillea and then the dogs started growling. They jumped at each other in such a way... And the small one jumped onto the neck of the big one, and that's when Beba had to intervene. -Caro, here. -The big dog, or the small one, I'm not sure, bit her foot in such a way... -Lift your feet, Grandma. -Yes. It went right through her slipper. That woman lost so much blood! Pass a raisin, dear. -Did Mom give you your tea towels? -Can't you wait until I'm done? But who is Beba? Is it the dog or the owner? Oh, dear, no. Beba is the owner of the dogs, honey. You see, those dogs, when Beba is around, they go crazy. -But when she's not, they are okay. -Use a glass, Joaqui?n. It's just that, sometimes, dogs fight over the love of the owner. Well, yes, if it happens among people, why wouldn't it happen among dogs? No, Mom, what happens is that Beba's too old to have these dogs. What do you mean, Lilian? Beba is young! -Mom, what tablecloth should we use? -Whichever! Are we eating in here on a day like this? Come on, let's take the plates. -Mom! -Let him do whatever he wants! Why do you look at your father? He gets a hernia if he moves. You take the board. Uncle, the light! -Hold on. -...your signature? -That was rude. -Carolina! What? No, not you. -No, don't ask me to do those things. -Come on. I don't really like it. I don't understand why my friend liked it. -Why would she like getting her name...? -The table won't fit through. -Make some room, there. Make some room. -Sure. -Caro, there! -Wait, Joaqui?n! -Move Grandma over! -Stop, Dad. -I'm sorry. -Okay, dear, be careful. -Grandma, are you okay? -Yes, Carito, yes. I'm okay. It fits through. He wanted to take the table outside, he took the table outside. He's got some character, your husband. No, your son. -Here, Uncle? -Come on, dummy, here in the shade. So? So what? Did she pick up? -You can call her too, you know? -Oh... I won't set a plate for her, then. Girls, bring back your auntie Silvana's plate! Mom, I admire you. If I didn't know where my daughters were, I don't know what I would do. -And you? -Store-bought grated cheese? Apologies, we're not that fancy in this household. What? Is it about money? You should've told me, I would've bought it. -Ernesto. -What? What, do you think it's not about money? If it's free, he'll take it. Can I help with the cannelloni, Lilian? Oh, my goodness, so many of them! How ridiculous! What is this doing here? I brought it home. Why would we leave stuff over there? Can we talk for a minute? Now? I saw the one you gave Mom, the one of your face. Very imaginative. -Is this what couldn't wait? -Don't play the idiot. You went to Aleli? on your own. That's not what we'd discussed. What was discussed? With whom? -We talked it over with Eduardo... -Eduardo is a Mazzotti now? Does he own the house? He's thinking about what he'll do with the money, isn't he? It hurts me too, to sell Aleli?. But houses don't have feelings, Ernesto. I see, neither houses nor people. This is a reality... and that's a non-negotiable fact. Mom is old, and being old is expensive. So you're Mom's spokesperson now, too? Why don't we ask her? Call her. -Mom! -Oh... Can we discuss this as adults? Sit down. Sit down, Ernesto. Okay, what? You saw what happened today, didn't you? Yes, you hit me with your car. I'm right. Mom can't live on her own anymore. Don't start something you won't be able to finish. Why don't we go together and check out the retirement home? She would have her own room, -there's a TV-- -I don't know about your mother, but mine won't be left to rot in a room as if she had no family. Okay, so what would you like? For her to die in a car crash? Or are you planning to take her to live with you? Have you seen the straws? Dad's straws. There were two of them, but I can't find them. The ones from Chuy? I'll give you 100 pesos. Go to the market and buy yourself a couple of them. -When did you get braces? -Last week. -Did it hurt? -It doesn't hurt when they put them on. Mili, what did we say about carbs? I don't know, I wasn't listening. Okay, enough, you have your dance recital tomorrow. What is she doing? Olympic gymnastics? Well, it's enough for you too, isn't it? Mom, I'm an adult. And do you know how hard it is to lose weight at your age? Have you decided where you will go this year? No, not yet. We're looking at plane tickets. Did you see I sent an offer to the WhatsApp group? -Yes, honey, I saw it, but not Rio again. -I like Rio. Joaqui?n, will you get off that cell phone? -But Dad is allowed to use his. -Edu... Blanco had it... You can also give your opinion about the trip. Yes, well, we always end up visiting churches. Well, it's my annual trip with my children, and as far as I know, you're my son, aren't you? Can we discuss a serious matter? When will you play for a real team? One for real men. -Come on! -So your uncle can go to see you play. Would you rather have him playing for Aguada with all those crooks? -That was Dad's team, wasn't it? -It was. Oh, sure, because your grandpa went to see Aguada often... -Now anyone has an opinion on my father. -Ernesto. -Dad... -What? Did you see Mili's new haircut? It looks nice. But she did it herself, in the bathroom, with no permission from Mom. Next time, she will call Grandma, so she can take her to the hairdresser, right? It looks nice. Caro cuts her own hair all the time and it looks nice. Some people also self-medicate, and that doesn't make it right. Do you think I gained weight? Let's go inside, I'll take a look, I'm not sure. -Pass it over. -Look how handsome Grandpa looks. Such a pity, it got smashed. -Miriam worked so hard on it. -Is Miriam still alive? For now... -This is like that movie, Alive. -How lucky. There you go, Dad. Here. Does everyone have cake over there? Yes! Shall we make a toast to Grandpa? Did they hurt a lot? -It does hurt a little, yes. -This one is amazing. -Do you like it? -Yeah, it's amazing. I want to get a-- Keep in mind, Joaquin, that, if you get a tattoo, you can't donate blood, and should anything happen to Mom... I think that's just for a year, after that you can donate blood. It's only for a year, Auntie. Well, I'll try not to have anything happen to me for a year, then. Why the hell did you ask me for crepes if you weren't going to use them? Well, I bought some on the way to save time-- What's wrong with the ones Cristina made? Answer me, Lilian, I'd love to know. It's fine, Ernesto, we can freeze them. Cover them with cling film and take them home. You're so vulgar. You always find a way to make me feel like shit. -Uncle... -Talk to your mother! Honey, where are you going? Where did your brother go? Leave him, Mom, let him do whatever he wants, he always knows best. ...Nacho Gonzalez passes it to De los Santos, -who falls down. He complains... -Defensor's defender is right about this. But then the ball was back on-- I look at him from a distance But we're so different from each other He grew up with the century On tramways and red wine My old man, my dear old man Now you walk slowly As if forgiving the wind I am your blood, my old man You have no idea how much I think of him. Did Alba get the flowers? I'm sure she did. Thank you so much, Etelvina. Sometimes, outliving your husband is a curse. Yes, well, my mother is fine. Don't worry. Did you get the money they sent you for the gardener? Because I'm at the house, it looks like a jungle. But I'm no longer in charge of that, dear. What do you mean? Ever since your sister Lilian told me that I wouldn't be needed anymore... Did she not tell you? So-- Yes, of course, I'm aware, it must have slipped my mind. Look, Ernesto, I really don't want to be a nuisance, but since you're calling, you do know there is still a bit of money I'm owed from my dismissal, right? The last thing I would want is to trouble you, -but since you're calling... -No, Etelvina, come by this afternoon and everything will be settled. ALEli? MEANS TRUE BEAUTY IN THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS Hi, you have reached Silvana. Please leave a message. Thank you. Silvana! What are you doing here? Are you following me? Why did you break the window? Don't you have your key? I forgot it. Can you please not be mean to me? Okay, let's see, what's the matter now, Silvana? Come here. Don't cry over this, you silly girl. Come here. I don't know what could have been terrible enough for you to miss Dad's memorial. Silvana. Lolo and I broke up. What do you mean? Again? You shouldn't smoke. -Why do you smoke? You shouldn't smoke! -Okay, stop it! I went to Etelvina's to get the key, but I couldn't find the house. -Wasn't it next to the bakery? -Anyway, she doesn't have the key anymore. -How come? -I don't know why. Ask your sister. Tell me, why did you start the renovations on the house if you were going to break up? -If you're worried about the money-- -Seriously, Silvana! Do you really think I'm talking about the money? You never liked Lolo anyway. I don't know why you pretend to be upset. Me? What do I have to do with anything? You call him "Slowlo." That's just a thing with his face. Anyway, you're the one who has to like him. -What? -Since when? -"Since when"? -Shut up. You're unfair to me, you know? I broke Mom's little painting. Yeah, don't worry. It can be fixed. Why don't you go to the bathroom and wash your face? Come on. What happened to your eye? -Nothing, a silly thing. -What do you mean "nothing"? -Tell me and I'll rip his head off. -Whose head? -Lolo's? Oh, Ernesto... -What? What are you going to say now? That you hit the door frame? A pair of rollers fell on my face. -A what? -Roller skates. I opened the closet to get my backpack and the roller skates fell on me, okay? Okay. Whose roller skates were they? Mine. Do you want to borrow them? -Dad. -Do you know if your aunt skates? No, but I can ask her. -Auntie! Do you skate? -No, not that aunt. -Your aunt Silvana. -Is that your father? How would I know? Call her. -Ask him where he is. -Just a second, Grandma. CALL ME WHEN YOU GROW UP Grandma's asking where you are. Bye, honey, I'll explain later. Mazzotti Auto Repair. Nancy, write down this address, it's Silvana's. Tell Freddy to go there with the truck and take all the furniture. They're moving. Silvana. Silvana. What are you doing? Dad's shirt looks good on you. You think I'll die alone, don't you? Better alone than with Eduardo. Idiot! Look. See? I'm glad you're here. Everything will be fine, you'll see. Soften it, fist. Yes, milady. If only I could find something... Where the hell are things in this place? -What are you looking for? -The big knife. Let's see in the cupboard. -What about this? -What? This? This was that stingy Lilian. Fucking shit! Move over, let me do it. Your sister thinks she's better than everyone else, but she's trashy. Look. An empty jar under lock and key. You do realize, don't you? Silvana? -Yes, I do. -Look at that. This is your sister's judgment. I bought this for Dad with my first salary. She kept the Coca-Cola cutlery, but this she left lying around. How nice. -Listen. -Where is the chocolate? -Is it here? -What? Listen. Here? Or maybe here? Bradbury Chocolates, 451 Fahrenheit degrees of pure pleasure. Do you need cash? So? What did you think? -Is that you? -Of course! Didn't you notice? Let's hear it, tell me something in that voice. Oh, I don't know, what do you want me to say? Pass the mayonnaise. Dad was very proud of you. He was. What? Nothing. Ernesto! Hello? Hello! Hi there, Ernesto! Won't you come closer? Sorry for bothering you, Ernesto. I just wanted to say that Mario and I are very sorry about your father, despite everything that happened, of course, right? After all, we've been neighbors for 50 years. In life one must learn to let things go-- -Thanks very much, Mirta. -You do know-- Ernesto, please don't go. You do know I was very concerned, right? Because the lawn was getting higher and higher, and I told myself, "They're not coming back. They’ve abandoned the house." It looked like a wasteland. I almost came with the mower myself, imagine that. Really? Good thing it wasn't necessary, Mirta. Because mowing the lawn at your age... Silvana, I'm leaving the workshop. I can pick you up to go see the notary-- Silvana, where are you? You won't even show up for-- It's me. Are you someone else's daughter? Won't you come to Dad's memorial? Niece, what's up? Auntie, Grandma asked me to call you. I'll tell her I couldn't find you. No, your dad must have told her we're here anyway. "Here" where? Are you with my dad? Here at Aleli?. Didn't he mention we were coming here? No, he didn't say a word, he just stormed off. What, like he did at Christmas? Exactly like that. Are you okay? Yeah, but you'd better not say anything to Grandma. -Tell her I didn't pick up, okay? -Okay, take care. -See you. -Okay, then. See you. -Mirta! -I just wanted to tell you what I just told your brother: that Mario and I are very sorry about your dad. So, tell me, did you get married to that guy? You didn't, did you? -No, Mirta, I'm single. -Well, if you're happy being single... Happiness is all that matters. On our side, Veronica has already had three kids. Can you believe it? Time flies, right? Look, I take so many pictures of them... -It's fine, Mirta. -Look at this cutie. Look. Look at that one. Okay, guys, I'll leave you. You have so much work to do, don't you? -Great. -Okay. Oh, one more thing. Please don't worry about the lawsuit. We withdrew it. Now that your dad is gone... there's no point on insisting. Plus, look at the tree. Your dad died and the tree was reborn. It's like magic, right? If you need a rake, I have one! Such a bitchy thing to say, right? That it was Dad's fault? What does she know? Dad would go at nighttime. Who else could it have been, Silvana? -There, here it is. -Where? Don't touch it. Shut up! Are you okay? Yes. I'll be right out. Do you need to come in? No, I was just checking on you, that's all. Hello! Is anybody home? -Carletti, what are you doing here? -Mazzotti! Is this a bad time? I was driving by to see a new property, but I saw the car, so I thought, "What a coincidence!" Let me introduce you to our architect, my son Eugenio. Look, Mazzotti, now that it's just us, no documents, no notaries, why don't we take this chance to go over the project? Blueprints can be so cold. Why don't we take a tour and let our imagination run wild? -Right now? -Shall we go in? Eugenio! Eugenio, would you do the honors? All units have a mezzanine, -kitchenette, barbecue-- -For your sole use! It's like a barbecue area, let's say. And it all overlooks the swimming pool, I don't know if you can see it here, but it will go where the hibiscus tree is now, right? -This part here-- -Let's try to imagine us there. One, two... Eugenio, move that chair. Three. Picture here the first brand new unit. An open kitchen area, which is so trendy now. A sofa bed for guests. And around this height... the mezzanine. Let's image the pool from the upstairs window. Nice, don't you think? And here... This way, Dad. And here, the barbecue area. Actually, that's the cesspools area. -And the barbecue area? -It's on the west side. Okay, let's go to the west side. ...all brand new: air conditioning, microwave, color TV, Wi-Fi. With the debris of the house, we will fill in the unevenness of the backyard. See? The project ends up financing itself. Mazzotti, get it through your head. This here... This is the future of the beach resort. Let's go, Eugenio. Eugenio! CARLETTI & SON REAL ESTATE It's so hot. I'm the only one working in this heat. COMING SOON SUNRISE - BEAUTIFUL BUNGALOWS To think that Dad bought this bare land. And suddenly... a house. I know I won't do even half of the things -Dad did. -"Half of the things Dad did." You don't get it. I don't get it? Do you see the "s" for Silvana on that sign? That sign is ten years older than you, girl. I don't care. I see "Al" for Alba and Alfredo, "e" for Ernesto, "Li" for Lilian. The "s," I don't know. It got lost. Will you keep complaining about this? No, we talked about it so many times... Good. It's no so difficult. I mean, "aleli?s" is also a word in Spanish. What I'm saying is that, if we changed it to the plural, -we would all be there. -No, Silvana. "Aleli?s" is not a word in Spanish. In any case, it would be "aleli?es." Are you called Estela? Are you called Esmeralda? -No. -Okay. Okay. Maybe I'd like to have a family that cared more about me -than about grammar. -There it is, look. Let it all go to shit, let the house collapse. For what it's worth... I still don't know how you'll make it. You break up with people every five minutes, you come to stay here without asking for permission... -Where are you going to go? -Excuse me? That. You like breaking up with people more than ice cream. Shocking. What? You are 38 years old, Silvana. Did you just realize that you go in and out of relationships? The house is mine too. Ernesto! -The house is mine too. -Yes, no one says it isn't yours. And I didn't know it bothers you that I come here. -It doesn't bother me. -Oh, no. So, what? Do you talk to Lilian about me coming here without permission? Ernesto! Why don't you buy it? -Buy what? -The bakery. Aleli?, Ernesto. You can come with Cristina and Caro, bring Mom... -Cristina never liked this beach town. -Did you ask her? Or buy another house in a beach town that you like. You don't have to do the same things Dad did. You do know that, right? What do you mean by that? You, Ernesto Mazzotti, did you ever wonder what you wanted? The workshop, for instance. What? Did you want it? Or was it because Dad left it to you? Who would have taken over if not me? No one complains when they get the check every month. Don't use me as an excuse, I can manage on my own. What? Don't look at me like that. Maybe you think I mishandle things, but I can manage on my own. Besides, if it wasn't for the workshop, you wouldn't be so quarreled with Lilian. What? Did Lilian say something to you? Hey, look at me. What did she say? Lilian told Mom and Mom told me, you know how it is. Do you know what I know? That you can buy your sister for what she's worth and sell her for what she thinks she's worth. A hell of a business. I registered you. What? For retirement. You are registered as cleaning staff in the workshop. You are kidding me. It won't cost you anything. It's just a minimum salary. But I work. Ernesto, you know that I work. I know you have your yoga thing and the jingles. But I don't know how those contribute. You're not that young, Silvana Mazzotti. Being old is expensive, be aware of that. Look, Ernesto Mazzotti, you don't know how my activity contributes because it's non of your business. My sister isn't my business? That's new. Can I ask you something? I don't know if it's my business, but... -I'm talking to you, Silvana. -It depends! What do you plan to do now? Where are you going to live? If you want to, I can talk to Mom. Mom has room to spare, and you need somewhere to live. The truth is that it would also be good for her to have company. Where are you? Silva--? Silvana, what happened? Silvana! What did I say now? Are you an idiot? Yeah, right! The tree is yours and the dirt is mine! Like father, like son! Just as rude as your father! Pretend I'm not here. -What? -I don't want to disturb you. You don't disturb me, Mom. Darling, don't you want me to wash your dishes? Dorita is coming tomorrow. But it's so nasty to have dirty dishes... Nasty for whom, Mom? It's just the two of us here. Oh, darling, look at the photo you chose! It's the one Dad had in his wallet. But it's from the worst time, when the store went bust. Didn't you have a better one? I'll boil water for tea, do you want some? That's when my irritable bowel syndrome started. Do you remember? I never fully recovered from it. Check the folder, there's the drawing of the girls. I already finished it. It's for you. We can frame it so it looks like the others. But why don't you keep it, dear? With all the work you put into them! But I had promised to give it to you, Mommy. Tell me, Lilian, did your therapist tell you how long you have to continue with this for? Continue with what? With this hobby. Because now, with modern phones, you can take beautiful pictures. But they're two different things. I do this because I like it. Look how lucky my children are. They do things because they like them. Do you know how they used to call me in the neighborhood? -"The hen with the chicks." -"The hen with the chicks." Because I had your brother in my arms all day, and you were always holding my hand. What could I do? Your father was never there. He didn't even come to your first Communion. What do you mean? What about that photo on the sideboard? I had to make you wear that dress the next day to take the picture. Because you didn't want to stay with your brother. You pinched his legs, poor thing. -You made him cry, poor baby. -I was a kid, Mom. How many more times will I have to hear that story? Besides, Dad took care of us. You are exaggerating. What? Say it. If that's how you remember it, great. I don't want to ruin your memories. Use a glass, Joaquin. Leave him, poor thing, he's growing up and he needs vitamins. See, Mom? In the end, Grandma is the only one who defends me. Of course, darling. How could I not defend him? I'm going to Beli?n's, okay? -Okay, take care. -I took money from you. Bye. -Bye, Grandma. -See you later, my love. See you later. Is he still with the same one? -With the one from the country. -Poor thing. No, but it's a phase. It will wear off. No, but I'm not saying it just because of the girl. So, why "poor thing"? Lilian, as a teacher you should know that children are like sponges, and that, deep down, he knows it. Knows what? That when you got pregnant Eduardo was about to leave this house. So, you're saying that Silvana... deep down, knows it? She did absorb everything like a sponge, poor thing. I don't know what my children want from me. For me to lie to them. Look, darling, I never made a saint out of a dead man. And if I don't do it with my husband, I won't do it with yours either. But my husband is not dead, Mom, he's in the living room. Don't remind me all the trouble, the bad times we went through. Your father used to say that Eduardo liked money more than work. No! Dad never told me that! Why do you think he decided what he decided about the workshop? Your tea is getting cold. Oh, I don't want to bother you, Lilian, but this mug wasn't washed properly. -I'll give you another one. -No, please! I can drink from a dirty mug. It must be an old tea stain. -No, let me change it for you. -But what-- Tell me, the cups that match the teapot, I did give them to you, didn't I? -You want the cups from the tea set? -No. I'll bring you the cups... -There's no need! No, Lilian! -I'll bring you the cups from the tea set. -Come here, don't worry! -I'll bring you the cups from the tea set! Were you sleeping? Etelvina. Am I interrupting? I brought you a loaf cake. Come in. Here's your money, count it. Oh, dear, I trust you. Money was made to be counted. Please, count it. Are you sure this isn't a bad time? -I can wait. -Etelvina, if we owe it, it's yours. -Can I bring you more water? -No, darling, thanks. I wanted to ask you... Without obligation, you know... Do you know what you're going to do with the furniture? Did I tell you about the Armenian, the one that lives on the third floor, -that comes and overstays her welcome? -Who is the Armenian, Mom? The one who tried to kill herself? No, that's the one that lives on the ground floor. -But she's better now, she's medicated. -Grandma... Milagros took the tablet from me and put on a movie that I already saw with my friends. Okay, look. Take this to Grandma Alba and then you tell the others that, if they don't share it, I'm going to take it away. I'll tell them. You'll see they won't listen to me. You tell them that I'm going to go and get it myself! ...save my soul I won't be there to greet you When you finally want to open Your heart Hello. -Hello. -What's the matter, Ernesto? Do you remember Dad's transistor radio? We bought it together, right? I can't believe that you're calling me about the radio. -Can you listen to me for a minute? -I don't have it, Ernesto. It must be in Aleli?. I didn't ask you where anything was. -I don't want to fight. -Now you don't want to fight? Who slammed the door and threw a tantrum? Was it me? Tantrum? Didn't you hear I don't want to fight? Are you deaf? You always get the tablet first. Can't you see it's my turn? There are other people in the world. Did you know, Ernesto? Sometimes you have to think about what others want. What do you mean, Lilian? When will you realize that Mom can't take these things anymore? Look, I wanted to talk to my sister. If you see her, tell her to call me. -Hello? -Grandma, Camila took the tablet from me and got my cousins on her side! Grandma, are you listening to me? It's not my fault! When we went to see it with my aunt, we had to watch a different movie, she had already seen it with her-- Grandma, are you smoking? You don't like it? Mom... Mom! What are you doing up there? Get down! You could fall and hurt yourself! It seems like Dorita doesn't like to get her fingers wet. Everything is poorly washed. Take this. But it doesn't matter. You and I can do this in no time. I teach you how to do it, and you can teach her tomorrow. Mom, your son just called me. And I think he was drinking. ...the endless dunes, and the imagination and joy. With five socks -We made the ball... -We made the ball And on that nap we lost By a goal -A little dog that was abandoned... -A little dog that was abandoned Became the winner's team mascot -Short trousers... -Short trousers, Lilian -Bag of memories... -¿Ernesto? -Bag of memories -Ernesto, are you in Aleli?? -I told you, Mom, that he would be there. -Short trousers Are you there, Lilian? Your friend Carletti stopped by. We took a whole tour of the bungalows. The truth is that it was beautiful. Now, explain this to me: Our spot is next to the barbecue area or to the cesspools area? Ernesto, have you been drinking? -What happened, Lilian? -Mom, don't get nervous. I'd already told you he was drunk. Stop dragging Mom into this! Don't be a gossiper! I just want you to know one thing. If Dad were here today, he would never allow-- Fucking shit! -What happened? -What is your brother doing? -Put him on. -Ernesto, are you okay? -What did you break? -Put him on please! What happened to my son? Why couldn't I speak to him? Am I his mother or one of your drawings hanging on the wall? -Take one of these, Mom. -Everyone's luckier than me with their children. Including the one that lives on the ground floor. When she left the hob on, her daughters came to see her, all the way from Dolores. -Hello? -Good afternoon, ma'am. -Grandma. -This is Mariela from Bronson Security. -This is about your property. -Did you put out your cigarette in Milagros' cup? An alarm was activated in the fourth zone, rear side window... Excuse me, do you always come to this dune? -What's up? -Hey, what's up? Wow, it's been so long! -So, so long. -So, so, so long. -Get out of here! -What? -You're giving me a funny look. -I'm not! I'm just looking at you. No, we have to block the wind. You're so annoying! I can't do it! Remember how you always used to say that we should do Ramones' covers -in Portuguese? -No. -You don't? -No. -Os Ramoes. -No, I don't speak Portuguese. -You do! Liar! -No! Hey! Ho! Vai embora! -Hey! Ho! Vai embora! -No! What a liar! I can't believe it. -Give me some. -Stop! An impatient liar. Guess what I did. -What? -I digitized the VHS tapes. -Really? -Yeah! Give me some. Stop! I forbid you to post them on any social network or tech platform. -Who are you to forbid me anything? -I'm the lead singer, baby. What? -Shut up. -Why? -Who do you think you are? -Who do you think you are? It's so weird to have found you precisely today. Good weird or bad weird? Nice weird. Hey, kids, watch out! Careful with the water! -Honey... -Sorry, they got sand all over you. -Baby. -Here you are. -This is Dani, my wife. -How are you? -How are you? -Those rascals are our children. Oh... I didn't know you had kids. Nice. Do you know who this is? Silvana. -Richi and I used to have a band. -Of course! The girl with the freckles. I saw you on the videos. Did he tell you he digitized everything? He was... He was just telling me about that, yes. Poor thing. -He wanted to see himself with hair. -What, are you calling me bald? -I would never do that. -Oh, shut up, "never." Oh, I'm sorry. We're smoking weed in front of the little ones. -It's not a problem. -Oh, well, I thought... Are you staying at your folks'? -Yes, with my partner. -Let's do something tonight, then. -I was just thinking the same. -Really? -Really. -Will you cook? -I'll cook. Are you up for it? -Will you? -It will be super fun. -Sure! Yeah. Cool. We have an amazing barbecue. It's great for the little ones. Do you have kids? No. -No. -Cool. -We grown-ups enjoy it more, anyway. -Sure. Of course. Anyway, I'll ask him later, -because he had a stomach bug... -Don't worry. -We'll cook something light. -Sure. Sure. Oh, sorry. -It's him. Sorry. -Is it him? -Yes. -Ask him, then. Yes, sure, will do. Excuse me. I'll just ask him... -It's great that you bumped into her! -Isn't it crazy? Hello? If you wanted the stuff, you could've warned me. What are you talking about? I just got home, Silvana. You took everything! I don't know what you're talking about, Lolo. I thought you wanted to take some time off. You didn't even leave the light fixtures. Not even my grandmother's rug! Stop. Could you please not talk to me like that? Really, I don't know what's going on. What's going on is that you sent some guys to ransack the apartment when I wasn't in and that fucking doorman helped them. What guys? I didn't send anyone. -You didn't send anyone? -No! Then why did they show up wearing the workshop's uniform and in a truck that read "Mazzotti," Mazzotti? Don't piss me off! -Talk to me like an adult! -Stop. What do you mean...? The workshop? What truck? Look, keep everything. I don't care about those things. See? You don't even know what to say to me. Good luck, Silvana. I'm in here. Silvana! -What? -Freeze. This is ridiculous! Why would a person storm in like that? Do you agree with all this? -Sir, calm down. -"Calm down"? You have a gun right there! POLICE Okay, sir, how do you explain this? What? There's broken glass in my house. What's there to explain? Is this your house? Look, we received a complaint about trespassing on private property from a woman called Mazzotti, Lilian. I don't believe this. What a bitch. Bronson says the alarm went off twice. Look, agents, you have been involved in some family business -that go way beyond your comprehension. -Ernesto! -What's going on? -Careful, you can't come in through here. What? What's going on? -Ma'am, stop. You can't come in. -What do you mean? -Ernesto, what's going on? -It was your sister, for a change. -Would you identify yourself, please? -I'm the sister, didn't you hear him? Whose sister? The complainant's? Or the detained's? Detained? -Both. I don't know. -Who do you think you're arresting? What happened to your eye? -No, that's a family matter. -...family matter. Well, get dressed, sir, you'll have to come with us. Why? Get dressed, sir. No. I will not move from here. I opened the closet door and they fell on me. What? The skates, didn't you hear? The skates fell on my face. Okay, let's wrap this up. Read the report and sign it. Is it necessary for him to be handcuffed? What do you think? Okay, give me a pen. Do you have your inhaler? My chest is tight, I don't know why. -Do you have it? -Stop. No, I can't. -Do you know how it goes? -Yes. -Better? -No, I can't breathe. It hurts right here. -Where was it that Dad felt pain? -On the other side. It's muscular. How long has it been since you last worked out? -I'm sure it's the exact same pain-- -It's not the same pain! Calm down. -Try breathing-- -It hurts, Silvana. But can you breathe? Come, let's breathe the way I taught you to. Come here. Lie down. Put your head here. Come on! Let's inhale through the nose, and slowly exhale through the mouth, okay? Let's go. Inhale. Inhale in three parts. One... two... three. Very good. Okay, again. Inhale. Do you think Cristina would agree to live with Mom? What? I'm thinking about taking Mom home. No, Ernesto, you shouldn't. Not because of Cristina. Because of you. Do you see yourself living with Mom? It's hard. I know it is. That's what I'm saying. No, getting old is, Silvana. Listen, we need to talk about something. It's not Lolo's fault that we broke up. No! What about that eye? Again with the eye? -The skates fell on my eye. -Stop lying, Silvana! -Since when do you skate? -I skate. I have roller skates! I skate! Ernesto, you need to stop meddling in people's lives. Call Freddy, tell him to go back and return everything. -Do you think I did it for the stuff? -I don't know why you did it. Look, I understand you want to help, but you don't know everything about everyone. You can't send a truck to ransack someone's house without asking, okay? And whereabouts do you skate? Do you have a helmet? Okay... the complaint has been withdrawn, you can go. Honey, what are you doing here? See? I was caught in the raid, Mom. This place is disgusting. Tell me you didn't use the bathroom. -Nope. -Let me see, I think I have some wipes. -Here, give me your hand. -It's fine, Mom, it's fine. Mom, it's fine. Enough. Ernesto. Ernesto, don't be childish! -Son, dear, wait for me! -Leave him, Mom, he's nervous. Let's go to the car. Please! Are you also going to boss me around? Let's get in the car. You were in hospital less than 24 hours ago! If you're going to keep me from doing anything, why don't you just bury me? So I won't be a burden anymore! Stop! Come, Mom. You're quite something, did you know that? What? Did you plot to come together? What happened to your eye, Silvanita? -Did they do something to you in there? -What would they do to her? Don't you know her at all? What did you do? Did you fall off your bike? What do you know about this? Can you not talk to me like that? Can you tell her not to talk to me that way? Can I tell you both of you not to talk to each other like that? Ernesto! Ernesto, can we please calm down? You need to understand that actions have consequences. There could have been an accident! Mom and I did it all for your sake. What if something awful had happened? You can't tell from the other side of a phone call! What have I done to deserve you three? Can you please keep your seat belt on, Mom? Ernesto! Ernesto! Can you please stop playing the victim? What are you doing, you sick man? Can't you see you're sick? You've gone mad! Idiot! Don't you have anything else to do? Could you be more of an idiot? What are you doing? You're sick! You're very sick! Are you... Are you laughing? Are you laughing at me? You're laughing, on top everything else! Don't you realize you're sick? No! No, not me! You idiot, no! No, stop! Stop! You're sick! Why do you smoke, honey? You know you shouldn't smoke, don't you? I'll get you soaked! Come here, you sick man! Go ahead, burn down my house! Idiot! Go on, you idiot! No, you sick man, stop it! I hate you! Moron! Don't get me wet! Let go! Not me! No! No! Do you want water? There! Don't you see you're sick? Beasts! You're beasts! You are a bunch of retards! What's your problem, you old bitch? -Come here! -Here, Mirta! You animal, what are you doing? You trashy scum! Mario! Call the police! Yes, Mirta! Call them, they have my details! I broke up with my boyfriend, Mom. Again? Let me tell you, I never liked Slowlo anyway. We bought a house by the sea By the sea With a dock, to go fishing By the sea Cars don't last much I'm gonna buy a new car By the sea Every night The walls wake up And the beams in the ceiling Start moving around The tiles come off And the parquet floor has unstuck blocks Seafood Melons in water In the sea People never look toward the sea Seafood Cars don't last long When I wake up The house is under the sea Every night The walls wake up And the beams in the ceiling Start moving around The tiles come off And the parquet floor has unstuck blocks
