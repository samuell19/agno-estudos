[♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, Prince. Hey. MAN: Hey, hey, hey! Come here. MAN: Hey, watch out, huh?! Hey. THUG 1: We wanna talk to you! THUG 2: Where are the rubies? [HORN HONKS, TIRES SCREECH] Van Ness wants to see you! Alive, you idiot! [GROANS] MAN: Call an ambulance! Oh, my God! EVERETT: To most of Fairlawn, California, Victor Prince was just one more miserable guy that died tragically coming out of the post office. But to Jack Stone, Prince was gonna turn out to be much more than just one more statistic. Jack was an heir hunter, H-E-I-R. And his job was to bring people together with the estates of relatives they usually didn't even know they had. Now, on this particular morning, he was going to that place outside of town that they call the Riding Academy. But, you know, they really didn't have any horses there, although the city council used to meet there. WOMAN 1: Whoa, cowboy. You can't go upstairs! MAN: Hey, you! Get the hell down here! [ALARM RINGING] WOMAN 2: Police! Raid! Everybody out! [ALL CLAMORING] Hurry up! What's going on? Oh! WOMAN 3: Oh! My shoe! WOMAN 4:Hey! [ALL CLAMORING] Wait a minute! Sweetums! MAN: Why's everyone leaving through the window?! Honey! Oscar! Oscar! I don't think you can afford this, pal! You're in big trouble! You-- Wait a second! You just cost me a 100 bucks! Oh, yeah? What would you do for $10,000? Up front? What do you want? You want some collateral? Yes, I do! Oh. A gold card? [SCREAMS] Bye, Oscar. Break my fall! This card's expired, you scumbag! Go get her! No, you go. I'm not going-- What difference does it make? You're about to get more money than you've ever dreamt about. Well, I have had some pretty weird dreams! Lay off the cheesecake! JACK: Could you do me a favor? Could you put on this dress? I really don't think this is me. I mean it's not cheap, it's a $500 dress, Cinderella. My name is not Cinderella. It's Destiny Charm. Whatever. I happen to know you as Cindy Davenport from Moline. What makes you say that? Your wicked stepmother just passed away and left you a pile of cash. Oh? Yeah, I thought you'd see it my way. By the way, you'll have to sign this contract. You see, the law requires me to take 30%. DESTINY: Not bad! The Riding Academy takes 60. EVERETT: Now, what other line of work could possibly provide such an enormous potential for adventure, wealth and fulfillment? Not too many people think "accounting." .006% of the population, to be exact. But 99.994% of the population isn't always right, you know. My name is Everett S. Willits, and I've worked here for my uncle Bernie for the last 15 years. EVERETT: These aren't rules, these are laws! It had actually always been rather quiet, but that was about to change, because Jack Stone's world and mine were about to collide. Good morning, Willits. Mail's in. Hey, wait a minute. Wait! Hey! There's a basket on this desk. The basket says "incoming mail." Incoming. [WHISTLES, IMITATES EXPLOSION] I put the label on that basket because I want my mail in that basket, not slopping over the edge of the basket. In that basket! What's this? It's this week's football pool. Really? Gambling? Mm-hm. Bookmaking? Mm-hm. I'm a little bit surprised that people in this office would be involved in such an illegal activity. A flagrant disregard for the law doesn't have any place in an accounting firm! So are you in? No, I'm not in, and I'm going to report this to Mr. Stadler! "And I'm going to report this to Mr. Stadler!" BAILIFF: Jefferson County Probate Court now in session. Judge C.C. Leichter presiding. Good morning, counselor. Please announce yourself and state your name for the record. Uh, Cathleen Markson as county counselor, appearing in the estate of Beatrice Davenport on behalf of the people. And since no heirs have come forward, Your Honor, the people move that the estate of Beatrice Davenport-- Pick up that woman! Or are you just naturally disruptive in a court of law? Your Honor... What? I'd like to present Miss Cynthia Prudence Davenport, the daughter of Beatrice Davenport and the rightful heir to the Davenport estate. Approach the bench. Hello. Your Honor, this is obviously a farce this gentleman is attempting to perpetrate on the court. This woman cannot possibly-- I'm not gonna be taken for a fool. Let's see some proof. [CLEARS THROAT] Your Honor, if I may, I am personally acquainted with this sleazeball, and he does not deserve the attention of this court. All right, Miss Markson. That's quite enough. Go ahead, young man. Uh, Your Honor, I believe that in lieu of contradictory evidence, familial resemblance is prima-- Prima facie, right, and considered proof. Young lady, approach the bench. Your Honor, I know Mr. Stone, and he probably found this woman in some brothel. DESTINY: Not true. You Jack Stone? Uh, that's right. [SNIFFLES] $279 and, uh... Come on, come on. ...36 cents. Thank you, again. This doesn't even cover the dress. Goodbye. It's so nice to be back in the fold. Wait, my wallet. You unbelievable sod. I researched that case for a month, and I know good and well that Beatrice Davenport had no heirs, not a daughter, and certainly not at 84 years old. Come on, maybe she was adopted. I don't know where you get off coming here and trying to ruin my life again. You ought to let me fix that button for you. This was my first case, and you knew it. I did not. You knew the DA was gonna be watching me. I did not. This is just a game to you, isn't it? You don't deserve to be in a court of law. I do too! Why don't you just go back to whatever rock you crawled out from under? I leave you for three years, you lose your sense of humor? I'm only gonna be here for a little while, so-- Good! While you're here, you stay away from me and my cases, or I'll have you arrested for fraud. I was thinking more like dinner. Really? Do you think that I have the memory of a gnat? You lost all chance of having anything civil with me three years ago. I don't know you anymore, and I don't intend to get reacquainted, however long you're here. Got it? I'll call you. So, junior's back to take up heir hunting, follow in the old man's footsteps, eh? Good for you. I could've told you that Davenport was a waste of time, but then, you never stopped by to ask. I won, didn't I? Oh. The judge felt sorry for you. If you're gonna play in this league, take some advice. Keep your eye on me, boy. I always get the cream of the crop. Ha! Checking the obits. Sign of a rank amateur. See this ring? This is from the Aldenhammer case. Cracked it in 44 hours after every heir hunter in town gave up. You swiped that case from my old man, scumbag. Your father was a two-bit hacker, boy. Wouldn't listen to a word I told him. You're gonna turn out just like him. How would you like me to rip the rest of your hair out? You're wasting your time with that. It's just nickel and dime. Football, Everett! Football! You see? "Stadler and Company weekly football pool!" How long you been working for Stadler and Company, huh? I just got a call from Mr. Gross. And he's very upset. And therefore, so am I. Mr. Gross wanted me to declare deductions to which he was not entitled! I've told you a hundred million times: Loosen up! Find loopholes! That's what my clients expect! That's what I expect! If you're incapable of finding loopholes, there are plenty of younger accountants out there who will! Well, are you asking me to falsify tax returns? I never, ever said that. I'm giving you two choices: Find loopholes or get out! [♪♪♪] Jack Stone? That's right. IRS. We need to talk to you. What do you guys want? I pay my taxes. We haven't received them. Mr. Stone, you owe the government more than $5000. That's crazy. How can I owe more than I make in a year? The Southern District office tracked you here. The long arm of the IRS reaches across mountains, valleys, oceans-- Dwayne! JACK: I thought that was the phone company. Listen, gentlemen, give me a few weeks, I can settle this. No, look, I'm sorry, Mr. Stone. Your time is up. Time's up. The district office has turned your case over to us for immediate collection. We thought we'd give you the courtesy of a warning. But if this matter isn't resolved in full by Thursday, you face jail. SECRETARY: It's Jack Stone for you, Bernie. He's got money-- Money? Good. Put him on. Ten, nine, eight-- Don't start that counting again. I'm upset! When you get to one, you're fired! Ah, Jack, old buddy. How are you? Uh, Mr. Stadler, how you doin'? I have a little problem, sir. Ah, I see. Six... Uh, you got some money for me from your father? Uh, well, sir, it's the IRS. They're, uh... They're threatening me with-- Your father has back bills here going four years. There's 500, 3000, 200-- 1986, he owes me money! I'm afraid you're gonna have to go it alone, Jack. Tell your father to call me. How can I pay if I'm in jail? What do you mean, jail? You never said anything about jail. Now look, Jack, when you give an accountant false information, he's just as liable as you are to go to jail! I could never, ever possibly-- Five, three-- Ten. Ten, nine... Maybe I could. Thank you very much, sir. I'm gonna do this for you, Jack, but I want you to remember, as soon as the money comes in, I want the first check, do you understand? You're helping me out. Thank you very much, sir. Whoo! --three, two, one, zero. Feel better, Everett? I'll clear my desk. No, no, no, no. It's not necessary. I've reconsidered. A very old and dear friend of mine called me today, earlier. This morning. I'm gonna give you another chance to redeem yourself by giving you a special assignment from this person. I want you to do his taxes... by the book. No loopholes? No loopholes! Thank you, thank you. I'll do a great job. You'll be so proud of me! I know I will, Everett. You have my personal commitment. BOTH: And one's personal commitment is the most valuable thing a man has to give. I know, I know. [♪♪♪] WOMAN: You have to make other arrangements for your father. You promised you'd be in with the money today. We can't carry you any longer, and I... I'm sorry, but this card is no good. Listen, can you give me a few weeks? The end of the month, Mr. Stone. That's all we can do. The end of the month? That's in a couple days. I'm sorry. [GAVEL BANGS] LEICHTER: Bailiff! A103: Estate of Victor Prince. No known heirs. Counselor, do the people have a representative for the estate? I am, Your Honor. Is there a representative for the heirs in the court? Since no heir has come forward-- Uh, Your Honor, I'd like to ask for a continuance on this one. Your Honor, here we go again. We have been over this case. I don't appreciate-- Son, do you know something I don't? Yes, Your Honor. I have a lead on this. Give me a couple of weeks, and I'll find you an heir. Your Honor! He did come up with an heir in the last case. All right, we'll give this case one of my famous 48-hour continuances. Forty-eight hours, Your Honor? If no heir has come forth at that time, the entire estate will escheat to the county. [GAVEL BANGS] This court is adjourned until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Son, come up here. I wanna talk to you. Get out of my way! Excuse me. Yes, Your Honor? Where's your old man? I thought heir chasing was his job. My old man? Oh, he's retired. No kidding. Yeah. Where? He's down in Florida. He golfs every day. Nothing but sun and fun. Oh, that's great. Well, he deserves it. You give him my best wishes, will you? I will. Thank you. Forty-eight hours. Thank you. I want to know everything about this case. Start a BI on Jack Stone. I want to know what he's been doing the past three years, who he owes money to, who he eats with-- Who he's been sleeping with now? [LAUGHS] Ha-ha. That's not funny. Oh come on, Cathleen. Everybody already knows about you two. Well, I don't wanna hear about it. Hey, gorgeous. You'd be wise not to talk to me. Did you do something to her? I wish. [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] [ENGINE RATTLES, SHUTS OFF] [CAR HORN BLARES] DRIVER: Hey, buddy, get off the road! Where are you hiding your tread marks? Tell me this is a liquor license. Well, actually, the law is very specific. The Internal Revenue code-- You can't just padlock an office! Well, Section 431 states that in lieu of cash payment, the government can seize-- You enjoying this, you little IRS pipsqueak?! I'm not from the IRS! Don't touch this Jacket! Easy. Everett Willits, certified public accountant. [CLEARS THROAT] I'll take care of this. Hang back. Right behind you. Come on, come on, come on. Yep, ahem. Hey-o! Bernie Stadler sent you? Oh, you got my money? Mr. Stadler sent me to help you do your taxes. [TOW TRUCK WINCH WHIRRING] He selected me especially for this case. I'm fully certified. I don't need help with my taxes. I need money to pay my taxes! Maybe that's why Mr. Stadler thought you needed an accountant. I'll put a call in to Mr. Stadler. I don't need an accountant, man. I need a genie. Did you see who did this? Yes, sir, I did. And you didn't stop them? Well, I wasn't able to, sir. Section 6335-- If you quote one more freakin' section, I'll rip your face off. Hey, you're doing a real good job here, buddy. Good job. Very nice, very nice. Let's go. By the way, do you drive a white 1978 Dodge--? Were these guys, like, tall, big noses, stupid-looking guys, thin hair? One guy with a black suit, another guy in a gray suit. Oh, my car! [HORN HONKS] Whoa! Hello! How's it hangin', Stone? Why'd you guys do that? You owe us money. We're gonna have to hold this property as collateral until you pay the full amount due. Then you can file form 549 in triplicate along with a copy of the canceled check and request the release of property. It's all explained in there. How am I gonna make money if you guys got my car? Take the bus. [LAUGHS] The bus! Oh, you kill me! [LAUGHS] [BOTH LAUGHING] HERMAN: What about a tricycle? DWAYNE: A tricycle! HERMAN: A skateboard! Where's a knife when you need one? Well, I have a knife. I won this in the junior debating contest. Hey, what are you doing?! Justice to my good name. I wouldn't have lent you my knife-- Don't you see that sign? What sign? [SIGHS] Are you gonna do my taxes or what? EVERETT: You're breaking the law. If they came back here, we would be put in jail. They're not coming back. I can't come in there! Well, then I guess we just can't work together, can we, pal? I'll just have to call up Bernie. No, wait, wait, wait! Look... Look, I cannot come in because I am a certified public accountant! I've taken an oath! Maybe if you brought the files out here, then I-- Are you sure that they will not come back? I know what you're thinking: "Did he dial seven digits or only six?" Well, pal, in all this excitement, I kind of lost track myself. But being this is an AT&T rotary-power telephone, the most powerful telephone in the world, I suppose you gotta be asking yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, punk, do ya? What are you talking about? Yeah, Bernie Stadler, please. No, no! Now, stop that! Hey, Bernie, Jack Stone. How you doin'? No, please! I'd like to see your most recent-- Your most recent receipts. You just tossed them on the floor right there. I'd like to see... your tax returns from last year. I don't think I filed last year. Well, what about the year before? I was out of the country? Well, when did you last file? JACK: I think that was '84. Yeah, I know it was '84 because I got a refund. EVERETT: What were you, 15 years old? No, I was 18. I worked at McDonald's. I got back like 26 bucks. But I was gonna have to pay the next year, so I decided I wouldn't bother cluttering up the system with my petty returns anymore. [CHUCKLES] You last filed in 1984, and you wonder why those gentlemen took your car. Oh, boy. Well, make yourself at home. And don't undo the tape for strangers. Wait a minute. Wait. Don't go. I can't be here if they come back. Suit yourself. Now, wait! Heh-heh, you seem to be forgetting something. You don't have a car anymore. [LAUGHS] But I do have your keys. Now, wait! What--? Hey! [CLEARS THROAT] No! That's a company car! Bernie won't mind. No, but the insurance regulations! I have to drive it! Oh, no! [♪♪♪] [HORN HONKS] Wait--! Where are we going? JACK: I don't believe that's any of your business, now, is it? This is my car! It's certainly my business! JACK: Just sit back and relax. [TIRES SCREECH] EVERETT: Hey, why are you driving like that? JACK: Driving like what? EVERETT: You're practically-- Look out! There's a cat! Oh, my God! Did you see that giant thing?! EVERETT: Cat?! I don't see a cat! Hey! Stop that! Put that window up! Put that window up! [LAUGHS] I'm trying to get these papers organized! 25 plus 20 is 45. 25 plus 19-- What are you doing? I'm counting down! 25 plus 22 is 47. Why are you doing it? I'm doing it because it calms me! What kind of music you got in this thing, huh? ♪ 'Cause it's a good day ♪ ♪ For paying your bills ♪ ♪ And it's a good day ♪ ♪ For curing your ills So take a deep breath... ♪ What time warp did this stuff come out of, anyway? Hey, hey, hey! That is Peggy Lee! Sorry. I thought it was Cher there for a second. EVERETT: What are we doing here? JACK: It's the warehouse of the deceased. I'm trying to find an heir to the Prince estate. EVERETT: Why don't you let the government handle that? I'm sure they could do a perfectly good job. JACK: Did you say you were certified or certifiable? EVERETT: We can't just walk right in there. You're right. You better stay in the car. No, I think I should come with you. No, I won't be two minutes. Stay here. Well, what if--? What if somebody comes up? Nobody's coming up. Well, what if they do? Go grab your little friend over there and sit in the car and do my taxes. Honk the horn. If you're scared, honk the horn. I'll be just two minutes. [♪♪♪] [CREAKS] Okay, Victor Prince. Let's see what you got here. Eleanor Bishop. "Return to sender." Eleanor Bishop. I don't think she's liking you, man. You better wake up and smell the coffee. [SIGHS] Hey, Jack, how about a cigar? Well, thank you, Mr. Prince. Don't mind if I do. Olives. [CRIES OUT] Finally. I've been running around like an idiot. Where you guys been? No, no, no. Are you aware I could have you arrested for trespassing? Didn't you hear me? I've been screaming for 20 minutes. "Jack Stone, heir hunter." Well, you're a bit off the beaten path, aren't you, Mr. Stone? Air hunter? What kind of gimme job is that, air hunter? Hot air, cold air, what? No, not "air," Liebchen. "Heirs." People. Oh, hairs. No, heirs. As in, "hope you don't have any." Who are you working for, Mr. Stone? I work for myself. I'm looking for Victor Prince. Why are you looking for him? I owe him a little money. Well, today is your lucky day, Mr. Stone. The Prince is dead. You can keep your money. Now, is there something else we can do for you? What the hell are you doing? I told you to stay in the car. Oh. Everett Willits, Mr. Stone's accountant. I'm here to do his taxes. Who are you? Uh, Van Ness Security. I'm Wilton Wan Ness. We're responsible for the warehouse. Did you explain to Mr. Van Ness why--? Yes, I did. I was just leaving. Did you finish my taxes? You carry your accountant with you everywhere? Yeah, the mafia carries their lawyers, us WASPs have our accountants. That all right with you? [LAUGHS] That's very humorous. You're a funny fellow. We better be on our way. Come on, Everett. Thanks a lot for helping us out, gentlemen. Air, hair, heir. What'd he mean, "hope you don't have any"? Keep an eye on those two. I don't want anyone else snooping around. Hope you don't have any what? Am I supposed to go bald or something? Wito, Wito, Wito. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PHONE] What house? Oh, warehouse, heh. How much can a warehouse be worth? You're kidding. Well, you do your thing, and I'll look into it. Who's next? Elvira Prin-- Prince. Prince. Oh, yeah. How fortunate. You do strikingly resemble the deceased. Especially around the mouth. Might you have been born in Toledo? No, I was born in Texas. Oh, Texas. Oh, that's too bad. Had you been born in Toledo, you might be coming into a significant amount of money. Toledo-- I said Tole-- I was born in Toledo, um... Ohio? Ohio! In, um... 1942. '42, yeah! Yeah. You'd swear to that in a court of law? Absolutely. Well, uh, that's good. I'll be right back. I'm going to get you a small advance for your services. I don't have to get naked? Oh... absolutely not. Good. 'Cause I'm a Catholic. [♪♪♪] You're gonna love this place. There's not an ounce of beef in these dogs here. I'm talking pork lips, chicken claws. EVERETT: Do you think they have tuna? Good afternoon, gentlemen. Oh, there's our boy! Hiya, Jack. How you been? I've been winning cases, my good friends. Cheers! There you go! Eh, that short-sighted old bag falls for that one every time. So... So, what? So where's my 30%? Who put you on to the picture gimmick in the first place? Excuse me, Mr. Ashton, no offense, but my old man's been doing the picture gimmick since I was 5 years old. I just happened to find the right dame this time. You'll get it in a few weeks. I'll be dead in a few weeks! Well, I'll make sure one of your heirs gets it. That'll be-- And you won't be dead in any few weeks. Hey, who's the bald-headed stiff? You an heir hunter too, kid? Everett Willits, certified public accountant. Oh! Oh, my God. Five-fifty. Uh ,listen, sweetheart, I don't have my wallet today. I don't know what happened. Could you put this on my tab, please? Be a sweetheart? Pendejo. Thank you. [CURSES IN SPANISH] How long you gonna be in town? Not long, sir. I just plan to crack another case, pay off a few bills and head back to L.A. What case, Rosenstein? The Victor Prince case, but you never heard that from me, all right, gentlemen? I heard, I heard. Never heard. Just like his old man. Living it up down there in St. Pete, huh? He's living it up. He's having a good time. He's living on the street? No, St. Pete. St. Pete's. Living in St. Pete? [LOUDER] St. Pete! I'm not deaf! Gentlemen, I got some cases to crack. Look, have him drop us a line once in a while. What are you talking about? Let's get this straight. He said St. Pete. He's back in ft. Lauderdale! Will you wait in the car, please? I'll just be a minute. Oh, no. I waited the last time. I'm coming with you. You did not. I asked you to wait, but you barged right in. That won't happen this time, 'cause I'll already be there. Bishop. Eleanor Bishop. What happened to Prince? Keep up or go back to the car. Oh, you didn't show me these before. I'm not here to teach you the trick. Give me your wallet. What?! What for? I have to bribe the manager. Bribe? Well, what about just asking politely? You know, if you're honest with people, then they'll help you. And-- And if you give them a chance, then their good qualities have an opportunity to come out. Okay. May I please borrow your wallet? Because I have to bribe the manager. Well, of course you may. Now, wasn't that simple? Wait a minute. Why don't you let me talk to the manager? Judy, this ain't the Ritz, huh? One more complaint and you're out of here! Okay, Miss Manners. You're on. [BABY CRYING] [JUDY SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] Got no vacancy. Nyet! Uh, pardon me. Now, I just need a moment of your time. I'm looking for a woman who might once have lived in this building. Uh, her name is Eleanor Bishop. Yeah, yeah. A lot of people might've lived in this building. Madonna might've lived in this building. Well, if you could just think back a little, I'll bet you could help us on this. Help you? Ha! And why should I help you? Because I asked nicely. [LAUGHS] Get out of my sight. Hey! It's not necessary to touch me! Now, sir... I don't know. Maybe this would, in some way, uh, help to refresh your memory. Well, it's comin' back to me. Slowly. Very slowly. At this rate, it's gonna take a couple of weeks. What, this is all my memory's worth to you, 20 bucks? I think it should be-- Sir, my friend here's not asking for both things in your memory, he's merely wanting to know if you recall an Eleanor Bishop. Why should I remember? 'Cause I would appreciate it if you would! Yeah! Yeah, she moved out! Uh, f-five years ago! I'll give you the address! [♪♪♪] 3800 West Pine? What a buttface. Okay, I'm disparaging, but that schmuck deserves it. She may really be here. This is gonna take forever. Let's get out of here. Hey, slick? Are you kidding me? [♪♪♪] My mother and father.

Well, this is definitely the place. Huh. Still can't read this name, though. Let me see that. What's wrong? I can't go in there. EVERETT: Why? Just because. What's the matter?

I don't even want to be an heir hunter. All I want to do is-- Hey, Jack! This is amazing! This is a tape! Look! [DOG BARKS ON RECORDING] Ha! Come on! Come on! We don't need to be afraid of this! We're gonna solve this case. [DOORBELL RINGS] CATHLEEN [OVER SPEAKER]: Well. Well, well. Gee, what's a classy guy like you doing in such a shabby part of town? Well, um, strictly business. In fact, if you just answer a few questions, I'll be on my way. Well, whatever it is, I'm sure you can call my office in the morning. Well, now, tomorrow's gonna be too late. Listen, this is quite simple if-- I've discovered that you have a connection to Eleanor Bishop. Is this true? Hi. [CHUCKLES MOCKINGLY] You are really stretching it, aren't you? Well, she's my mother. But you're too late. She's been dead for years. Besides, I thought you were working on the Prince case. Well, that's another matter. But, uh, I believe you may have some money coming to you, and if you just sign this piece of paper, we can-- That's enough. That's enough. You-- Both of you get off my property this second or I will sic my dogs on you, and I am not kidding! [CHUCKLES] Uh, Cathleen, your little dog trick's not gonna work there, sweetheart. [DOGS BARKING] Uh, Jack? Look, Cathleen, I'm not lying to you. I'm telling you the truth this time. [BUZZES] [BARKING] I-is the barking getting louder? Would you be quiet for a second? Cathleen, I'm not lying to you. Jack! What? What happened to the little recording?! I don't know, pal. That thing used to be a Cocker Spaniel. I told you she was still pissed at me. It's not my fault. I already told you that. Would you leave me alone? Oh, leave you alone? What, are you angry? Maybe we can do that little backwards-counting thing. What do you say? Let's do it together. Two times five is ten. Two times four is eight-- Would you stop it? Now you messed me up. I gotta do this again. Two times five is ten. Two times four is eight. Two times three is six. Two times four is-- Oh, boy. You know, I don't like you. Why, because I tease you? No. Because you're arrogant and you think you can con everybody. You don't treat other people as if they were real people like yourself. You act like-- Like some character out of a bad western. You throw people up against the wall, you make fun of them, you lie to people, you call them names. I do all that? Yes, you do. And I find it extremely unpleasant. Well, excuse me, Mr. Child-Man. Numbnuts speaks. "Don't leave me in the car by myself. I'm afraid of my own shadow. Somebody might sneak up and get me." Oh, my God. "Drink your milk. Eat your Wheaties!" Give me a break with this. Total. What? You see? You don't listen to people. I don't listen to children. [SCOFFS] Look, I'm 41 years old-- And a child. I'm not a child. I am a respectable and honest adult. You could learn something. I bet you've never been laid before, have you? What?! Have you ever been laid? That's certainly none of your business. Forty-one years old and a virgin? [CLICKING TONGUE] Look... For your information, I happen to have many women friends with whom I have very intimate and fascinating relationships. Yes, I'd like to meet one of these chicks. This is getting very personal, and I don't think we should be talking about it. Let me tell you, you're exactly the reason why I left this podunk town in the first place. I didn't want to wind up 41 years old and a virgin. You know, you're the reason that I never wanted to live in Los Angeles. Everybody always lying and cheating and trying to outscam each other. Yeah, like it's different here. It is different here. People here are honest. They work for a living. [TIRES SCREECH] [EVERETT GASPS] Yo, that'll be a buck, mister. What for?! Clean off your windshield. Wha--? That-- I'm not paying that! That's highway robbery! Just give him the buck. It's the principle of the thing. If I want to clean the windshield, I could just turn on the wipers. You need a new wiper. It's kind of nice. It's sort of a combination fly swatter/windshield wiper. This is a company car. I was trying to keep it nice for Uncle Bernie. Don't worry about it. Just, uh, sit back there and do my taxes. I can't do your taxes. My whole system is completely messed up in there. Besides, you keep-- You keep asking me to do all these things that are illegal. I'm not asking you to do anything illegal. Well, all those phony medical bills. They're not phony. Where's your father, Jack? My father's in Florida. He's retired. There's no need to lie. There's nothing to be ashamed of. My mother was in the hospital for three years before she died. Hey, look, I don't want to talk about this, okay? Suppose you don't solve this case. What is going to happen to your father? Listen... you're here to do my taxes. So sit down and do my taxes, okay? I know that obviously you don't want my opinion about everyth-- Exactly, Everett. I don't want your opinion. But if I do want your opinion, I'll ask you for it. What's your opinion? Well, in all the Hopalong Cassidy movies, the bad guy always has an accomplice on the inside telling him when the bank is gonna send out a big shipment of money on the stagecoach. So my theory is-- Hopalong? The cowboy with the black hat. Hopalong? That's his name? What is this guy, a freakin' rabbit? Boy, you know, if you were a little older, you might have more culture. Well, when I start losing cases, I'll listen to you. Just trying to be helpful. Here you go. A little something for one of your fascinating chicks. You're taking this? Yeah, well, a third of this is mine. You want a TV? Thirty percent is not a third. Well, it's close enough. Loosen up. [♪♪♪] [CREAKS] So, what are we looking for? Pictures, papers, a journal, anything. Oh, documentation. Just like with the IRS. Very funny. Say, you would've liked Victor Prince. He has exactly the same filing system as you. [SHUSHES] [WHISPERS] Shoe boxes. [AIR HISSING] [EVERETT CHUCKLES] Say, how much do you think a Pontiac Special cost in 1954? I don't know, 3000 bucks? [IMITATES BUZZER] [SHUSHES] You're wrong! It cost a thousand bucks. Ha! All-you-can-eat fish dinner for two at Howard Johnson's, what's it gonna run you? I don't know, 3000 bucks? [SOFTLY IMITATES BUZZER] You're wrong again! $6.33, including the tip! April 1965, your wife's having a baby. What's the hospital gonna charge you? A baby? A doctor, a hospital room, a couple of nurses. This one is for the Hawaiian vacation. Let me see that receipt. Not until you guess. Come on. Give me the receipt. I can't believe it. What? You found the paper. I did? You found the documents. This is what I'm looking for. So soon? [SOFT CLATTERING] What was that? Wito, now they've heard you! Why don't you just let me go in there and cut 'em? Yeah! Come on. Bring the box. Why do I keep you two? Wito, listen, I'll give you one more chance. We want to find out where they go. Ah, nice. EVERETT: Oh, no. What are we gonna do? Is this Mr. Thornton's car? Yes, it is, and there he is. Wanna wave to him? Hi, Sammy! Got your keys, pal. Get in the car, Everett. You want to get in the car? No! She only gave me 48 hours, pal, okay? Get the car, Wito! Get the car! EVERETT: I really don't think we should be speeding in a stolen car. JACK: It's not stolen. We're just borrowing it until we can get your tires fixed. Jack, they're following us! Hey, look out! Whoa! [HORNS HONKING] Oh! That was a stop sign! Two plus two is four, two plus two is five, two plus two is six. I need to borrow a five. [GROANS] [TIRES SCREECH] Hey, behind us! Yo, brother! [TIRES SCREECHING] WOMAN: Hey! --times 10 equals 10,000. Ten times 11 equals... 200 million thousand-- Oh. There. You see? You ever know a couple of dogs that could resist a rump roast? Promise me you won't drive like that anymore. All right, Hopalong, get ready to hop. [DOORBELL RINGS] [SIGHS] Yes? Uh, Cath, it's Jack. We still need to talk, sweetheart. Jack, please go home. Oh, the dogs! Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoo! Oh! Look out for those bloody dogs! I can't hold them off! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, little buddy! Look out for those mean dogs! Look out! [BOTH IMITATE BARKING] Look out, little buddy! Here comes the big one! Oh, my God! He's got you by the behind! Look out! Look out! [EXCLAIMING] Hi. It's okay. Very clever. Well, I never expected to see a smile again. Don't start that. Listen, you got five minutes? We need to talk some business. Five minutes. VAN NESS: Wito, you idiot, you hit that crossing guard. I did not. She jumped out of the way. VAN NESS: Thirty feet in the air, backwards? They're well trained. All right, I mean, this is ridiculous. You look a little-- Little damp, Wito. A little damp. I'm very susceptible to colds. I understand, Wito. We're gonna have to pick up some antihistamine. I don't wanna take any chances. No, no. It's better not to have a cold in that nose. Yeah, right. Fine. I take flowers to my mother's grave regularly. What does that have to do with anything? I can't tell you that, not until you sign this contract. Not on your life! "Sign a contract." Okay. Well, maybe you might find this interesting. Uh, you were born at Midtown Memorial Hospital on April 19th, 1965-- At 4:14 a.m., and I weighed 7 pounds four ounces. Four ounces, that's right. Anybody could get that information. Yes, but not everyone would have the original hospital receipt. Jack, this one hospital receipt is not enough to make me sign a contract. I'm a lawyer! And you have two minutes left. This is not worth it. What do I care if she knows who her real father is? Let's get out of here. I don't-- I don't care. Thank you. Thank you very much. My real father? What is that supposed to mean, Jack? My real father is Andrew Markson. You might remember him. He's the one that was gonna give me away to you three years ago, as I remember, on April 7th, except a very appropriate thing happened on April Fools' Day: You decided to skip town. Ring any bells? I've been meaning to talk to you about that, but you've been avoiding me. Here. I've been meaning to strangle you with this for quite a while. You'd probably like to hock it anyway. [♪♪♪] Listen... no matter what you may think of me, I think it's only right that everybody knows who their real father was. Yours was a guy named Victor Prince, okay? Here's everything you need to prove that, free of charge. No strings? Just look at the stuff. [SIGHS] CATHLEEN: Burma? Burma? Two days after I was born. What a jerk. Oh, well. He bought me dolls when I was born. That's something in his favor. He left these for you as well. She must have hated him never to tell me. "Every day is like an eternity, saving every dime so I can return and reunite our beautiful family. I know you understand and will forgive me. All my love to you and our beautiful... Cathleen." Oh, my God. She never opened one letter. I think I... I'd better go. What? I'm sorry if I hurt you. Um, Jack, um... You know, I acted really badly. I'm really sorry. I-- [SHUSHES] I could've got us killed, you know. I know. You're sometimes a little bit reckless, Wito. Well, you know, that's what you're paying me for, to be reckless. That's very true. Oh, my. You're very fast. [KNIFE PIERCES FLESH] But not entirely accurate. Hey, partner. Listen, I need you to... [TIRES SCREECH] Good. But... But those guys are out there. What guys? Van Ness. Well, I think you're seeing things. They're gone now. They were out there. Look, I don't wanna talk about this. Take the car, meet me back at the office in a couple of hours, okay? Jack! Hey, now, isn't this something? You solved the case, you made up with your girlfriend. It's just what I was saying: Treat people nicely, great things happen. What difference does it make if she doesn't claim the inheritance? Oh, she will! And I think they're gonna give you an award just like your father got. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Yeah, my father. A real hero, right? Solved cases, brought families together. He found true heirs. That's a distinguished American citizen. Well, now you're a distinguished American citizen yourself. Listen, pal, my father was a chump, okay? He couldn't do anything right. He's a nice guy. He's got a heart of gold. But still, he's a chump. You know why I left this place? I didn't want to become just another distinguished American citizen. Well, I'm sure your father is very, very proud of you. Because I wanted to get a job. I wanted to go to school. The whole time I was there, I... I dug cemetery plots... and I washed cars. I even ran leads for an old, broken-down heir hunter like my old man. Now he's sick. And I'm back here again bailing out a sinking ship. [♪♪♪] [SPANISH ACCENT] I am looking for my father, my dear departed papi, my rich relation. Struck down before his time by the angry horn of the bull. You must to help me to claim my inheritance. "Jack Stone, heir hunter." I found this wallet on the street. And providence has intervened at just the right moment. Part of the cosmic plan which none of us can question. The only thing that we can do is to play out our roles and accept our fates. Yes, you're right. The causal relationships between individuals have been proven to be much more than statistical chance. Yes? It's called providence. Kismet. Destiny? Oh, Jack, this woman needs our help. Yes. [CHUCKLES] Please, señorita, sit down. Grazie. Believe me, we won't turn you away. Your journey here must have been long and hard. Oh, yes. Very long and very hard. You look tired. Let me get you a glass of water. Oh, grazie. Tell me, did you buy this little costume with my credit cards? [NORMAL ACCENT] All rejected. You double-crossing meatball. I was humiliated at Neiman-Marcus. I am terribly sorry. But you can repay me. See this photograph? This man looks exactly like he could be my father. We could do our little scam again. Scam? The phony act about my mother. Phony? Don't bullshit a bullshitter. Let me tell you something, I was being honest with you. That's something you won't understand in your profession. Oh, what is your profession? [SPANISH ACCENT] I was a kind of a hostess. In a Mexican restaurant? Sí. I understand why you need our help. Yes. I recently did an audit of the Costa Sonata chain. Yes? Let me tell you, it was ama-- Excuse me, can I have just a little private word with you back there? Thanks. I was in the middle of a conversation. Do you mind? What are you doing, my friend? Interviewing her. You solved the Prince case. Now I'm getting us a new case. Since when is it "us"? You. You. Of course! I meant you. I meant you. Jack, this woman obviously needs our help. Now, if you don't want to help her, maybe just for tonight, we could act like partners, and you could turn this particular case over to me. Let me tell you, this is not a case. This is a prostitute pulling a scam. There you go again, casting aspersions. I think we should seriously consider-- I don't care what you think. We're not taking her as a client, and you and I are not partners. But, Jack, didn't I find us Cathleen's documentation? I don't care. Isn't that worth something? I can't hear you. I don't care. We don't have to be equal partners. We could be number one man and his partner, like Batman and Robin. Batman doesn't have a partner. What are you talking about? I'm talking about Batman not having a partner. Rent the movie. What about Robin? Who's Robin? He's Batman's partner. Batman doesn't have a partner. Well, he used to! Señorita, I am very, very interested in your case. I would be very happy to help you find your inheritance. You would? Yes. [NORMAL ACCENT] Thank you so much. You know, I'm sure that I could find some way to repay you. You've lost your accent. I'm bilingual! [LAUGHS] I'm Everett Willits, a certified public accountant. See, I attended the Montrose Institute. It's a marvelous institution, and I learned... I used to work at a kind of a ranch. You did? Really? What, were you a cowgirl? [BOTH LAUGH] Yeah, I've done my share of riding, sure. Hmm. [GIGGLES] Um, listen, what did your partner, Jack, tell you about me? Oh, Jack. What a character. Oh, I don't know, he said... He said you were some kind of a woman of unvirtuousness or something of that kind. I don't know. Is that what you think? No! Well, hmm. Then why did you invite me back to your apartment? Well, I wanted to help you find your father's inheritance. Oh! [BOTH LAUGH] That's so sweet. That is so nice. Mmm. [LAUGHS] I really like your pad. Oh... It looks like a really nice place to stay. You like John Maynard Keynes? EVERETT: Oh, yes. He's my hero. Mine too. Providence. Destiny. Oh, God. Destiny. Destiny. Destiny. No. But you know what? I have an enormous amount of ironing that I've got to do tonight. I have so many things that I have to do. Listen, listen, tell me... I want to call you tomorrow morning first thing. Give me your telephone number, please. Here. I'll write it down. I have my notebook. Um... It's, uh... It's 555... 385, uh, 3. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [GIGGLES] That's an awful lot like my number! [BOTH LAUGHING] What do you mean? What are you saying? Well... I don't have a place to stay. You don't have a place to stay? I hope it's all right. What do you mean, to stay here? Yes! [BOTH LAUGHING] What do you mean, to stay here?! It's very kind of you. No. No one's ever stayed here, believe me. Oh, stop it! No, no. But wait. I mean, I'm not gonna send you away. I can't put you out into the snow. Oh, stop it. All right. I'm gonna sleep here on the couch. No. And then, come on. Yes. Get out of here. Come here. I'm serious. This is a wonderful room. Right in here. Now, look, if you want to use my toothbrush, there's a telephone over there. Here's the number, and you could call me. I'll see you in the morning! Everett? [PANTING] [♪♪♪] [EVERETT GROANS SOFTLY] Destiny. Destiny. [LINE RINGS] [ON RECORDING] Hello, this is Jack Stone, heir hunter. Where there's no will, there may still be a way. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] CATHLEEN: Jack? Hi, it's me. I need to talk to you. I'm having a little trouble handling all of this. Please call me, okay? [DOGS BARKING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Who is it? VAN NESS: Miss Markson, this is Mr. Rodgers from the neighborhood watch committee. We've heard some suspicious noises outside your house. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Everett Willits, CPA. Everett, where have you been? The IRS just called. What?! I want you back in this office right now! Bernie, what are you saying? This is too big for you. You understand? You have a responsibility to this office, and I expect you to carry it out! So I want you here by 10:00. What?! Bernie! Good morning. Who's Bernie? Bernie's my boss. Oh. Good morning. [CHUCKLES] Boy, well, I have a problem. Uncle Bernie wants me to come to the office, and I already promised Jack I'd go to court. Boy, what am I gonna do? Well, what do you want to do? I've gotta make a decision. Haven't you ever just, you know, let loose and done what you wanted to do? Oh, God, that sounds so wonderful. It sounds great. It sounds great! But what am I supposed to do? I'm not that kind of person. I mean, I analyze the situation, and then I make a decision, and then I know that it's gonna be the right decision. And so, you see, that's the way that I get satisfaction out of life. Satisfaction? Yes. Now, I admire that... intensely. Oh! Mm! Mm... I don't think we should be doing this when I have such an important decision to be making. Yo, it's Jack! Come on! Jack? Who's Jack? I don't remember. I got some greenbacks to collect! Come on! EVERETT: Jack! Jack! Wait a minute! I think I have to-- I have to go to work for Uncle Bernie, Jack! Are you kidding me? Are you gonna testify for me or what? Mm, and-- And I think that you have to do this without me! What about commitment? Yes, that's very important. You've made a commitment, so stick to it, pal! Come on, man. Come to the door. I'm gonna get rid of this guy. Yes, darling. What are you doing, man? I really need you. Hi. It's Thursday. Hey. You're under arrest. What for? Trespassing, tax evasion, grand theft auto and interfering with an Internal Revenue Service investigation. You'll never work in this state again! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] Come on. Read 'em their rights. Everett! I can't believe it. My license... gone, gone, gone. What are you whining about? This is a nice place. Are you crazy? This is jail. This is where bad people go, not accountants. Uh, excuse me, I'm an accountant and I'm here. I'm bad! You mothers had better look out. Let me tell something. If you would've paid as much attention to my taxes as you did Conchita, neither one of us would be here now. Your taxes? I am in jail because of your taxes. We should never have gone into that office. Hey! Hey! This is your fault. My fault? Take a little responsibility for yourself, pal. You walked in here on your own two feet. Responsibility? For what? I did nothing! You're the one who's the criminal! The criminal, the criminal! What are you yelling about? I'm the one whose life is ruined. Are you kidding? You're gonna walk into court. You're gonna get your share of that inheritance. The case is in 30 minutes. I am dead. Great. I'll send flowers. Artemus gordoniums or whatever the hell they are. That's not funny. You shouldn't kick a guy when he's down. I'm getting tired of hearing you tell me what I should do, what I shouldn't do. Are you gonna hit me now? You're just lucky I don't believe in violence. You look pretty angry to me. I am angry. I can be angry and not have to hit somebody or drive like a maniac or cast aspersions on people. And I'll tell you something, you better stop casting aspersions on my friend, Miss Guerrero. She is a noble human being. You don't deserve to shine her shoes. I didn't cast aspersions. All I said was she was a prostitute. I asked you not to say that. Listen, pal, Miss Guerrero, Cinderella, whatever the hell her name is, is a prostitute. She works down the Highway 9, she works at the Cowgirl Riding Academy. She makes 100 bucks an hour, and she'll probably go around the world for 3-- [INMATES EXCLAIM] MAN: What a shot! Violence debases the human spirit! Puh! MAN: Give it to him! Come on! Let him have it! What are you waiting for? That was a good shot. Don't congratulate me. That was the most disgusting thing I've ever done in my life! [♪♪♪] [PRISONERS CATCALLING] [BLOWS KISS] [GIGGLES] It's that one... and, uh, that one. JACK: What, we're out of here? Oh, señorita, I love you. I missed you. OFFICER: See you at the ranch, honey. EVERETT: I just didn't like the way that man touched you. DESTINY: Don't try to lie to me. I saw that look on your face. You were disgusted. Lie?! Look, you said that you were a hostess at a Mexican restaurant. Well, Everett, I am a hostess. Come on, man, we're on. DESTINY: I entertain people, men. Well? Look, I know. I understand. I know what you do for a living. I get it. I see. You are just like all the rest. The rest of what? I know that you are shocked. You are disgusted. No. So please, Everett, just get out of my car! Just get out! Why? What do you think? You and your friend can take the bus from now on. Come on, don't-- Don't you worry your virtuous little heart about me, okay? Look, I'm not-- I don't mind! It's fine! Just get out of my car and leave me alone! Wait a minute. Wait! Don't go, baby! Come on! What are you doing? I-- I don't mind your job. What's--? Where is everybody? You're a little late, Jack. Are you kidding me? It's over. It happened a little before noon. She took the whole estate? Ha! With the help of Sammy Thornton, of course. Yeah, of course. Sorry you had to miss the show. What a way to get even. You know what kills me? The whole time, she's working with Sammy Thornton. I can't believe it. I hate this guy. I want to kill this guy. Well, you know what Lagrange said: On the table of life, men are spoons, women are forks. Oh-ho-ho, yeah. So, what--? [GRUNTS] What are you gonna do with your father now? Look, I don't know. I don't-- I've been taking care of this guy since I was 13 years old. I'll figure something out. You know, I'm gonna help you get out of this. No, you know what I want you to do? I want you to forget about everything. Just go back to your job. I'm not just gonna leave you here like this. I started something. I'm gonna finish it. This is over, Everett. It's already finished. What are you talking about? I'm through. Just stop following me. What do you mean? What are you saying? Look, go back to your desk. Go back to your paper clips! Tell Bernie I wrecked your car! I'm sorry! I'll pay you back in a few weeks! Just stop following me! [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SIGHS] I really tried, Dad. I mean, I really tried. But I just couldn't make it happen. Hey, let's have a little toast, huh? Jack Stone, Jr... failure extraordinaire. Here you go, Pop. I brought you some olives. It's the only thing I ended up with from that Prince case, and I had to steal that. You see what I got you? Anthemis tinctoria. My favorite. That's right. My son used to bring them to me. Such a good boy. But he never comes to visit anymore. I miss him. I miss you too, Pop. [GAGS] Easy. Go easy on that! There you go. Spit that out. [COUGHS, GASPING] You all right? What is that? A ruby? [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] A ruby! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Pop! Oh, geez! Pop, look at this! You've done it! Jack Stone, you've done it! Rubies! [EXCLAIMS] Maria, keep the change, sweetheart. I believe we're squared up for the year. Take a look, boys. Level with us. What'd you do, knock over a bank? Big score, huh? I'm out. I'm out. Wait a minute. Let's see what you've got. He probably stole it from that pea-brained bean counter he brought here the other day. Don't you dare cast aspersions on my good friend Everett. If you weren't 100 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled butt. Violence is debasing to the friggin' human spirit. I'm only joking. Anyway, I'm just 90. Come on, play cards. What do you got? Three jacks, gentlemen. Read 'em and weep. Jacks will beat you every time. Bet you couldn't do it twice. Mr. Miller, this is for you, sir. Gentlemen, I wish I could stick around and share my success story with you, but I got a date with some olives, know what I'm saying? It's gonna be new teeth and riding lessons for everyone. What'd he say, new meat? Yep, that's what he said. Maybe a hearing aid. [♪♪♪] Oh, thank you, God. We have to talk. What you said about causal predestination and destiny... do you live by that? Yes. And you're not gay? Gay? How could I be gay? I'm miserable. [TIRES SCREECH] [♪♪♪] VAN NESS: In here, Wito. I have some things to explain. You see, Victor Prince and I were partners in a ruby mine. We smuggled the little red beauties into the country as a kind of retirement fund. Unfortunately, we disagreed on how to divide our property. I won the argument. CATHLEEN: You murdered my father. VAN NESS: No, no, no. Don't you read the newspapers? He was struck by an auto while crossing the street. You'd be really stupid to kill me before you find the rubies, wouldn't you? Oh, but... we shall find them. And you shall help us. WITO: You know, boss, I sometimes complain about you not paying enough, but I'll tell you, I'd do this part of the job for free. EVERETT: Ah! Why didn't I realize this before? Mmm... because you weren't relaxed. Oh! I think commitment, commitment-- Go, my darling. Finish. I think I've got it. 246... Oh, God! Hurry! Yes! Yes! 11,268! Yes! Oh! Oh, yes! We did it! BOTH: Yes! Yes! Oh... [TELEPHONE RINGING] Huh? [LINE RINGING] So? Huh? Huh? What? Jack? Jack? It's that stupid bean counter. He's no help. You dialed the wrong number, schmuck. I didn't dial the wrong number. Give me the phone. Give him the phone. Maybe he'll do-- My arm! Don't hang the guy up! Hello? Listen. Hello? Hello? We've gotta get a hold of Jack Stone. Not here. Jack is not here. Give me that phone. Give me that phone, will ya? Hello? Jack? Hello? I got some broad here. All right, give it to me. Listen. Are you there? What's wrong? He solved the Prince case. We wanna turn our teeth into a trip to Florida. What? Jack solved the Prince case. [GROANS] You know, it's ironic. Your father was a master jewel thief and you are an aspiring district attorney. No wonder he never mentioned it. He must've been very ashamed. Wito... Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Now I've seen everything. WITO: Kill him, boss. [GASPS] Again. [CATHLEEN SCREAMS] Holy cow. [GROANING] Boss, I got him. [SCREAMS] [GROANS] JACK: Sorry about that. Come here. Hey, come here. See ya! Sweet Jesus. Sorry. No, it's just me, the poor schmuck you double-crossed today in court. What are you talking about? I've been here since last night when these vultures grabbed me after I went-- Then you weren't in court today? No, and you came to get me anyway. Yeah, but who-- Wait a minute. Who was in court today? My, my, isn't this touching? Careful, Sir Galahad, or the girl will be dead. Where are they? Where are what?! My rubies, where are they? I don't know, pal. I just came to rescue the girl. Jack, if you know, tell him. I don't know. Say bye-bye to the pretty lady. Jack... Yeah? Jack. Yeah? Oh, man. They're in the olives. What? They're in the olives, in place of the pimentos. My inheritance? Yeah. Remarkable. [♪♪♪] The scumbag Van Ness, I'm gonna get him for this. But not right now, of course. Now that I've got you here, why did you dump me at the altar? My butt itches. Where? Could you just reach your foot...? There? Yeah, that's it. Good. Good. Okay. This is it, boss. Last one. There better be a lot of olives in that jar. We're looking for olives?! Rubies. Excuse me. What was I supposed to do? I mean, I was a stupid, poor kid from a broken home whose jerk-off father couldn't rub two nickels together. You're this beautiful, rich girl. We were getting married. I couldn't handle that. Jack, why didn't you let me decide whether you were good enough for me? 'Cause you were blind. Well, thank you for taking such good care of me. You've really improved my life. Hey, you got your law degree, didn't you? Oh, and I couldn't have done that with you around? You couldn't afford that. Jack, I went to school on a scholarship. My stepfather never had any money. You saw where my mother lived. I knew all about you. And that's why I loved you. Really? Oh, I've missed you so much. Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? [LAUGHS] Oh, thank God. Hi, Everett. What are you doing here? I told you to get lost. Well, you can't tell me how to live my life. Well, fine. Then, uh, could you cut us down? Not until you tell me how you got all that money. What money? His share of your inheritance. Well, I can explain. You see-- Yeah? I fenced a few of your rubies yesterday. You stole them? Yeah? My rubies? And you weren't gonna tell me about it? You rotten, sleazy heir-hunter bum. Oh! Oh! Get away from me! Boy, am I glad to see you guys. Ah, well, take a good look, then. It will be your last. My patience has just run out. [PEOPLE CHATTERING IN DISTANCE] I think it's the police. Watch them. I'll be right back. OLD TIMER 1: What's that thing? OLD TIMER 2: You don't know? It's a chastity belt. Excuse me, gentlemen. You can't come here. This is a private warehouse. Private whorehouse? No, not whorehouse, warehouse. Look at this. Oh, you don't see quality like this anymore. That stuff's imitation. No, no, it's real. [SNIFFS] Oh, yeah, I remember the smell. From 50 years, he remembers the smell. It's Naugahyde. It's Corinthian leather. That is Naugahyde! Gentlemen, please! You can't come in here. This is a priva-- Hey! I think they're giving a demonstration. No, no-- Excuse me. [OLD TIMERS ARGUING INDISTINCTLY] You never told me you paid your father's hospital bills. And don't forget, we still get our cut. God, I don't believe this. I had this all under control. [OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS] [GROANS] Wow, ha-ha! [ALL CLAMORING] Attaboy. I'm coming. Here I am. There! Oh! Hurry up! You hurt my boss. You hurt my-- [SCREAMS] I want to get my inheritance. Are you kidding? That case is over. I know. I know the judge. Are we gonna help those old guys? JACK: It's the bad guys that need help. Hey, Everett, come on. You coming with us? No, my destiny awaits me. LEICHTER: In light of this new evidence, I hereby reverse the decision of the court and award the entire estate of Victor Prince to Cathleen Markson Prince. [SQUEALS] Judge, you can't do this to me. I know my rights. Victor Pro-- Victor, right? Yes. Victor promised me all his stuff before he died. I saw the will? Yes. I saw the will. Really? But, Your Honor-- That's my decision. Well, see, see-- So sayeth the court! Well, as far as I'm concerned, this-- This court is full of flatulence! And as far as I am concerned, you're in contempt, buster! Bailiff, take this man out of here! You wouldn't dare! After what I've done for you! In the slammer. You get out Christmas, you'll be lucky. I think this will explain everything. These returns aren't valid. You're no longer certified as a tax preparer. Certified? Certify this. The claims that you made against my client are fraught with errors and falsifications. Mr. Stone, as a legitimate finder of heirs, is entitled to take deductions of his office, car, restaurants and other expenses. In addition, Mr. Stone has incurred over $20,000 in medical expenses, which he paid on behalf of his dependent, Jack Stone, Sr. It's all in the tax code, gentlemen. Look it up. Page 198, sections 7 through 15. Furthermore, we are deducting the extensive damages inflicted against my client by your, ha-ha-ha, so-called collection department. Now, wait just a second. What damages are you talking about? What damages? The Internal Revenue Service owes Mr. Jack Stone $11,268. [♪♪♪] What's this mean? Gentlemen, under the circumstances, I suggest you leave before I report you to your superiors. Don't worry. You can handle it, Dwayne. I don't... Everett. Everett! That was wonderful work! Wonderful! I've got a surprise for you, Everett. I'm going to-- I am going to give you my key to the executive toilet. This is for you. Uncle Bernie-- Well done, my boy! Well done! I don't want the key, Uncle Bernie! I just don't see devoting the rest of my life to keeping this office afloat. After what I did for you? Who nurtured you? Who took you into this firm and gave you a desk at Stadler and Company when your parents died? I know. I understand, Uncle Bernie. I'm very fond of you. I just feel that way. Then you're fired! I want you out of here! You understand? I don't want scum like you in here! You ingrate! You-- You disgrace to this profession! And I want that heir hunter out of here too! You understand? That's it! Go! Leave! Wait a minute, Uncle Bernie. You're the one who sent me to do Jack Stone's taxes three days ago. And I went out there and I did exactly what you said. And, you know, I've learned... Don't! ...the most incredible things out there. You know what's amazing, Uncle Bernie? There are people out there who are actually living their lives. They're actually experiencing life. They're taking risks. They're having a wonderful time. They don't save their receipts. Do you know that certain people actually are willing to sacrifice their entire financial well-being for the sake of another human being, certain people like Jack Stone, the heir hunter, whom you're disparaging? Now, I'm very fond of you. I'll come to your house on the holidays. I-- I-- I just don't want to work for you anymore. I don't want to. I'm sorry. All right. I'll give you, I'll give you-- Uncle Bernie, have a wonderful afternoon. I have to leave now. But you-- Hey, partner. Listen, I was just looking at this Jensen case. Thought, you know, what the hell, you might want to look at it. What? Did you hear all that that we were saying? Yeah, I heard that. You know, you really shouldn't eavesdrop. I apologize. If we're gonna be partners. JACK: So we're gonna be partners. EVERETT: Wait! Wait! I forgot to tell about the rubies! You remember when that poor Victor Prince was so miserably killed in front of the Fairlawn Post Office? Well, two weeks later, the package he mailed miraculously arrived. It was addressed to his estranged daughter, Cathleen, and it contained more than an apology. EVERETT: Ah! It's my inheritance! [SCREAMS] We're rich! Oh, my God, baby! Everett! Everett! I think this calls for a little toast, folks. Oh, yeah. [LAUGHS] Oh! Oh. [LAUGHING] Oh! To a happy marriage. Yeah. Oh! And so Jack decided to stay in our humble, little town and make me his partner in crime. And, you know, we both turned our respective share of the rubies, because he did give me a share, into what Kurzfeld called warm blankets on the sagging mattress of life. We're both as happy as clams, and neither of us is in any danger of leaving this world wanting for anything, including heirs. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
