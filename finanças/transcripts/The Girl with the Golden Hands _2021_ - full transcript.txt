GUDRUN: A miller had gradually fallen into poverty. He had nothing left but his mill and a large apple tree behind it. Then the devil approached him and said, "I'll make you rich if you promise me what is behind your mill." What could it be but my apple tree?, thought the miller and said, Yes."

(INHALES, EXHALES) (KEYS JIGGLES) (GRUNTS) MAN ON RADIO: I have a question regarding the nightingale: I don't mean to compare our nightingale population -with Berlin's... -(WOMAN LAUGHING) MAN ON RADIO: ...but I was bicycling through the former East for two hours yesterday and I saw so many hedges... But I had to stop counting the nightingales I heard because there were so many. That's delightful, of course, but maybe you know a trick how I could also see them? That's not so easy, right? WOMAN ON RADIO: Mrs. Tucholke, can you help Mr. Hannes not only hear but also see the nightingales? (MUSIC PLAYING OVER TV) (TROLLEY WHIRRING) Rinse aid. Now dishwasher salt. Ah, thanks. (INHALES) ANNOUNCER OVER PA: (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Now tabs. God, dishwashers are as complicated as cars. What's all this for? I got your mother a fully automatic dishwasher -for her birthday, -What? But Werner, that's an unnecessary luxury. I have two healthy hands ideally suited for dishes. I'm sick of drying them. The tabs. Here. I wanted to read my speech to you, Werner. -To you alone. -Alright, I'm listening. Here? She'll be home when we get there. [in English] Okay. "My mother has a beautiful voice." ANNOUNCER OVER PA: (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) "It can sound warm and dark, rough or shrill, young or old, or tired. Bleating like a goat or neighing like a horse isn't a problem for this voice." (CHUCKLES) "When I was young, we brought empty egg shells back to the henhouse every week so the hens would have enough lime for new eggs. My mother cackled like a real hen every time. And each time, the rooster crowed. He was confused because he didn't recognize that chicken's voice." 10.99 DM, are they crazy? -Hey, are you listening? -Sorry. "With that wonderful voice, she read me fairy tales from a thick book with old-fashioned letters. Even after I learned to read and write, she alone could read those letters, and thus maintained access to this world of queens, dragons, apples and poisoned spindles." Very beautiful. Look: 5.99 DM. Let's do that. Half the price. She won't like it, but I don't care. We can pay now. Is that all you have to say? -I want gummy bears. -Got 'em! Should I keep the chicken part or cut it out? Keep it. The chicken is good. Look who I brought. -LARA: [in English] Hello. -So you're here. Happy birthday. (CHUCKLES) But no singing. I've got something for you. Thanks, put it down. Here! (CHUCKLES) Thanks, but it's your birthday. Please, do it for me. (WATER RUNNING) GUDRUN: They're making them again in Delitzsch, and they're just as stale as in the old days. Hmm. Mm-hmm. You need an ironing board. No, I already ironed it this morning. -I hate marzipan. -I know. I'll eat them for you. GUDRUN: Everywhere I went this morning, they sang. It was awful. Excuse me. There you go. My dress isn't wrinkly. Lara, I want you to look neat. The whole town is coming. Unbelievable. Oh, and how long is your speech, roughly? Open my present. Don't distract. It's important. So is my gift. I'll do the presents later in peace, Lara. And your gift was to be your speech. I wrote one, but you won't like it. What? Let me see it. GUDRUN: I didn't limit myself to the facts. And instead? Werner? LARA: I talk about how much I loved you reading me fairy tales. Lara, nobody cares. -LARA: Do you want to hear it? -Yes, later, but... first let's write a speech you can deliver. "Dear attendees..." Blah, blah, blah and so on. "Congratulations on your birthday, dear Mama, to your 60th." Then you say, and this is important, "As everyone knows... you grew up in the orphanage here." -Are you serious? -Wait. "We're celebrating your 60th birthday. But nobody knows your real age because back then, this day was arbitrarily set as your birth date. I think you're much younger. Because you look much younger." (WERNER LAUGHS) Then everyone laughs and... I look flattered. LARA: You're sitting on my dress. Sorry. And then... "You became a math and gym teacher. Two talents you didn't pass on to me." (BOTH LAUGHS) LARA: Write down my father's name while you're at it. Oh, Lara. Don't annoy me. You had two parents. I had no one and don't moan all the time. -LARA: I'm not moaning. -GUDRUN: Fine then. WERNER: You and I met in '71. GUDRUN: Lara was already in school. It was '72. WERNER: No, we met in '71. You only noticed me in '72, that's true. GUDRUN: Fine. I'll change that. WERNER: In '71, please. GUDRUN: Then you continue, Lara: I'm fit and sharp. You always had enough to eat when you were hungry, and a warm room when it was cold outside. I took you to the doctor when you were sick and... "Thanks for that." "No problem." Hugs and kisses, then dessert. -I'm not doing that. -GUDRUN: Why not? Lara, those speeches are always dreadful. Simply too long. The shorter the better. Now please close the door, it's cold. Are you alright? -I'm a bit dizzy. -Sit down. Have you eaten today? Here. Have some of these. They're for you. Keep them sealed. No, I'd love to share. I can open them. -There. -Thanks. There are more than enough. God, they taste good. Huh? Just as stale as old times. -Superbly stale. -You're stale. (BOTH CHUCKLES) -Please bring me your dress. -Eat them all. No, Mama. Yes.

The seat of honour. -There. -Ah, nice. -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -(GLASS TINKLING) So, Victoria has something to say. My dear Gudrun, I know you hate speeches in your honour, but today you'll have to bear it. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) When we met... in 1946, on our first school day, our teacher, Miss Hagen... Mrs. Hagen had placed a jar of honey on each student's desk from her husband Mr. Hagen, who was a beekeeper. And a plumber. He fixed heaters, too. -VICTORIA: Exactly! -(ALL LAUGH) So, I sat next to Gudrun and my jar was missing. I started crying and Gudrun asked, "Why the tears?" And I said, "I'm the only one without honey." So, she gave me her jar. You may not remember, but that was formative for me. After school, I ran home to my mommy and got a sandwich with butter and honey on top. So, I was home and you went back to your orphanage, yet I was the one crying about the honey. I just wanted you to know I was impressed then and still am today, which is why... This isn't from Mr. Hagen, but it's from Tasmania and the most expensive one I could find, to thank and congratulate you. -(ALL APPLAUD) -Thank you. -Now stop crying. -VICTORIA: Sure thing. Sit down. Thanks. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for... Thanks, Victoria. ...for you all coming to celebrate my birthday with me. -And I... -Good evening! May I have your attention for a moment? (ALL LAUGH) ABV MIKE: A little birdie told me a certain... One moment. ...Gudrun Pfaff, female, is celebrating her birthday. I only have this sketch. Is this citizen present? (ALL CLAMOUR, LAUGH) ABV MIKE: You do look like her, I guess. Do you have a permit for this cozy gathering? (ALL CLAMOURS, LAUGH) ABV MIKE: No? Well then sorry, I'll have to terminate this illicit assembly. (ALL CLAMOURS) My dear comrade policeman Mike, don't be so strict with our birthday girl. -Come now, have a beer. -ABV MIKE: Thank you. -JUTTA: Then we'll see. -So, I raise a toast! JUTTA: Here's a chair. ABV MIKE: I don't need to sit down, but I'll put my beer on it. And now for something else: (CLEARS THROAT) Why can't Westies swim? They only know one move. (ALL LAUGH) Yeah, us stupid Easties. What's an Eastie actually made of? Clay, water, and shit. But careful of that shit. Take too much of it and you get a Westie. (ALL LAUGH) ABV MIKE: I need a sip of beer. I just came from an accident. It was bad. On our country road. Two cars, both wrecked. One half on the road, the other 100 meters down in a ditch. The driver of one was white, the other was black. Who did I help first? The black one, because he's definitely not a Westie! (ALL LAUGH) ABV MIKE: My captain always says, put all Westies in a sack, tie it up and bash it with a club. Then you'll never hit the wrong one when slapping on Eastern solidarity tax. (ALL LAUGH) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING, LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE) (SINGING INDISTINCTLY) ABV MIKE: What a wonderful trip down memory lane! (ALL APPLAUD) You look good. I was just in London. At the stadium. Special offer: flight, hotel, ticket, and return the next day. The big wide world, right? (CHUCKLES) Trying out nothing new. Only in England. It made me think of you. How you left back then. How you struggled. And now you're living a life I can only dream of. I see. So you don't want your house, car, shepherd and stupid friends? Why are you so pissy? I thought we'd chat at your mommy's birthday. No, I don't chat with assholes. Don't act up. What do you know about us? You ran away! -If you wanna talk-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know where to find me. (LYRICS IN GERMAN) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) (♪♪♪♪♪) Do it now! -No, tomorrow. -You're such a coward! -Know what? I've had enough... -Me, too. You're always whining.

(INDISTINCT CLAMOUR, LAUGH) GUDRUN: Is it true? What? GUDRUN: You're selling the orphanage? Yes. I thought that's common knowledge now, isn't it? It'll be really good for our town. Gudrun, don't let it spoil your mood and... good night. (FOOTSTEPS FADES AWAY) JUTTA: Jens? Jens! Stay there. Stay there! Stay there, Mayor! (CAR ENGINE STARING IN DISTANCE) JUTTA: Great idea, Kathi. Fantastic move. You could've told her, too! JUTTA: But not tonight! Sure, you only put things off. VICTORIA: Can someone tell me what's going on? JUTTA: It's her birthday. VICTORIA: Did you know? -Yes, everybody knows. -Why don't I? JUTTA: Here comes the cake. No, it's too early, girls! -No, it's perfect timing. -Gudrun! Stop it. The cakes are here now. Put them down. JUTTA: (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) Lara left. VICTORIA: Why didn't you tell me? I'm his secretary. JUTTA: I hardly knew either. I only knew it was being discussed... (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) WERNER: Just put it down over there. My God, my God! The party will continue. Gudrun will be back. Sit down, sit down. Have a piece of cake. We need the little plates with the forks. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) VICTORIA: They should've told her beforehand. (♪♪♪♪♪) Mama! Mama! Mama! (BREATHES HEAVILY) -Good morning, Mrs. Pfaff. -Good morning. Happy birthday by the way! I heard it was a milestone birthday. Thanks. -Care for some coffee? -No, thanks. Help yourself. Belgian chocolates. They're exquisite. My new gadget. I press this button... and boom, it's transparent. Then I press again. And we're alone again. Pure physics! So, what can I do for you? I'd like your assessment as a financial expert. I assume you're also at home in real estate. -STREIFENEDER: A bit. -Yeah. It's about the orphanage. I'd like to know how much the building and premises are worth. You want to buy it? Only in the abstract for now: How much would it be? Currently one DM. -One DM? -STREIFENEDER: Yeah. One DM. Here are two DM. (STREIFENEDER LAUGHS) STREIFENEDER: That's not how it works. No? Why not? STREIFENEDER: The price is symbolic. The actual costs, however, are not. Whoever buys the property for one DM, contractually pledges to cover renovation costs, which will be double-digit millions. You see, Mrs. Pfaff, the manor house, which was once an orphanage, wouldn't be maintained without such incentive. The millions will be sunk in no time at all. Just think of preserving such a historic building: endless terms and conditions, all of which cost a pretty penny. (SCRUNCHES) -Thank you. -I'm sorry. Gudrun! Werner called. He wants a call back. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (DOOR BELL DINGS) There. (EXHALES) (DIAL TONE RINGING) -WERNER: Hello. -Hello. -WERNER: Good morning. -Good morning.

Thanks. -What's the matter? -GUDRUN: Nothing. -Lara's leaving. -GUDRUN: Yeah, alright. Want to take her to the station? GUDRUN: She's old enough to walk alone. Hello? What have I done wrong now? WERNER: You could give her a little sign that you're happy to see her. I gave her chocolates. -You don't get it. -GUDRUN: I'm hanging up. WERNER: Do whatever you want, as always. -JUTTA: Everything alright? -Yes. If you have nothing to say, I'll be leaving. Know what? We hired a photographer last night to take a picture of us all from the orphanage. Our surprise for you, but no, you ran away, leaving your own birthday party! You know how many people bent over backwards to show you a good time? (DOOR BELL DINGS) BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: Gudrun, come on, let's... take the time to-- Gudrun. What are you-- stop for a second. Gudrun, why are you always so stubborn? Let me explain... (TYRES SCREECHES, THUDS) (♪♪♪♪♪) I'm at... Town Hall Square, Briesenow, there's been an accident. I'm Jens Riechenberg. Please hurry! We have to wait. Ms. Pfaff? Mr. Schandel? -WERNER: Yeah. -LARA: Yeah. -Everything's alright. -(SIGHS) She had a concussion and is in a state of shock. We need to keep her for a few days. Yeah? Great. If you want, I can take you to see her. -She's warm. -Her hands are always warm. True. -Are you alright? -Yeah, just a shock. I'll drive home and get her things. The keys are in my coat. -LARA: Yeah. -(KEYS JIGGLING) See you in a bit. "Dear Gudrun, it's really happening: We're getting older."

(KNOCKS ON DOOR, DOOR OPENS) -GUDRUN: Lara. -Mama. Come here, sit down. I'm so glad you're okay. How are you? Why aren't you on the train? I was wondering the same thing. It's not like you're dying. He's selling the orphanage, Lara. He arranged it behind my back and I didn't notice. Lara, you have to stay. LARA: Eh, what? Yeah, stand in for me at the town meeting. -I won't do that, I can't. -Yes, you can, Lara. Just... make an effort, you know? Be brave and speak your mind. You mean speak your mind. -You don't care, right? -I do care. It's bad, I know, but... see it as an opportunity. How stupid of me. Of course you don't care, you don't even live here anymore. -Sorry, it didn't occur to me. -Mama, I do care! People turn stupid when they only do easy stuff. Giving a speech on your birthday is easy for me? GUDRUN: Stop it, Lara. Just tell me what I can say to make you feel good and accepted, because I really don't know. I always get it wrong, don't I? What would I do at the town meeting? I don't even know what it's all about. For God's sake, do nothing, Lara. But you just told me to go there! GUDRUN: That was a test. -I'd try it, Mama. -No way, it's too important. -Good. -Good. Oh, then leave. I am leaving! GUDRUN: Go back to Berlin as usual and ignore all the trouble here. -You excel at that! -I brought you things from home. Leave me in peace and go at last! Toothbrush and toothpaste are here, okay? So, it took a while. The shop downstairs was closed, but maybe Lara can bring... -GUDRUN: She's just leaving. What? GUDRUN: She's working tomorrow night. She has to zip an opera singer's dress. Her work is too important to be cancelled. Yeah. Bye. -(DOOR CLOSES) -(SIGHS) Here you go. Thanks. -Hmm? -Hmm. Is there anything else I can do for you? Go home, Werner. Thanks. -Alright. -Yeah. Get some rest. Sorry. -Sleep well. -Hmm. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) -Good morning. -HENRIETTE: Good morning. I'm Lara Pfaff, Gudrun Pfaff's daughter. I found this card at my mother's. -It's from you. -Yeah. -Did something happen to her? -LARA: She had an accident. But nothing serious, just a concussion. It's all good now. Sorry... to barge in on you, but I... found this card and figured you know my mother? HENRIETTE: Does she know you're here? No, she'd be appalled. Have you heard of Peter Melzner? HENRIETTE: Yes. Do you know him? Do you know how I can reach him? -(CELL PHONE RINGING) -HENRIETTE: One moment. Well, it's been over 30 years. He fled to West Berlin at some point. That must've been before I did. Hello. Go on in, if you will. -And you're Gudrun's daughter? -Yes. Well, I have to join my client, but... please get in touch. -Call me. -Sure. Then we can talk. I'll get my business card. Mm-hmm. -Here. -Thank you. -Your hands are golden. -Yeah. I know. It won't come off. -Fine. -I'll get back to you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. (DOOR CLOSES) (GRUNTS) You're leaving the hospital against all medical advice. Yeah. You had a concussion. That's not to be trifled with. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You're to rest a few days. What's wrong with that? Yeah. Where can I sign? Victoria? -VICTORIA: Gudrun, oh my God! -Victoria, listen. -VICTORIA: How are you? -Listen! -I'm coming, but I'll be late. -VICTORIA: Can you even talk? Delay the town meeting, alright?

I wanted to see you in peace. It's always so hectic before performances. Where is it? -Here. -Unbelievable. "Dear Mama..." Wrong card. Wonderful! "History, Then" By Lara Pfaff. A novel. That's so great. Such a good publisher! -You hit the jackpot! -Yeah. I'm so proud! -I have to go. -Go ahead. I've got this now. I'll be back at 7:30 sharp to zip your dress. Not for much longer, though. (DOOR CLOSES) (NURSE HUMMING) (HUMMING CONTINUES) -(CHURCH BELL DINGING) -(BIRDS CHIRPING) LARA: Melzner, first floor. (DOOR CLOSES IN DISTANCE) Oh, sorry.

Yeah, try to... better capture the bottle shine. This part is good. Take another look at that shawl. (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) PETER: Gisela, what can I say? It's beautiful. No advice necessary. Thanks. Katrin, I see your idiosyncratic style. May I... can I have the brush? Add some contour here. Watch how I... Looks better, right? -Yeah, okay. -Try it. Look at the shade of that green, and what happens now. -You know? Try it. -KATRIN: Yeah, thanks. PETER: You really only want to watch? Yeah. I like watching. I haven't even introduced myself. I'm Peter Melzner. (CHUCKLES) Lara. PETER: Such a beautiful name! In "Doctor Zhivago," there's a Lara. -You know the novel? -Never read it. Great book, great love story. -Wine? -No, no. PETER: In 1958, Boris Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for it, but Khrushchev put pressure on him, so he rejected it. In '89, his son accepted it, almost 30 years after Pasternak's death. That's how they treated their artists. Wait a second. Wait, wait, don't move. GISELA: Great. KATRIN: Amazing, Peter. GISELA: We'll never be that good. PETER: For you. Thanks. Thanks for letting me watch. -Goodbye. -ALL: Goodbye. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Can I leave you alone for today? Thanks so much. See you next week. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Lara? I hope I didn't make you uncomfortable. The ladies won't leave me alone. They always want to see my pictures. Drawing you was a way out of the situation. Had I drawn one of them, the others would've wanted it, too. It's alright. I'd regret it because there's something special about you. I see that right away. -I can't paint at all. -Something else, then. I mean sensitivity. You have an artistic streak. I'm sure of it. What kind of pictures do you paint? I mean, what do they look like? What style? Oh, they're not good enough... to show them to you. Too bad. (DOORBELL RINGING) (BREATHES HEAVILY) Gudrun. Shouldn't you be in the hospital? You wish. You look truly terrible. -Sit down, come on. -Yeah. -Please! -Yeah. Would you like a wet cloth? I want you not to sell the orphanage. I know you want that. But Manuela and Eugen's son, Daniel, is an unemployed bricklayer. He wants me to sell it so he gets another job. GUDRUN: The worst part is that it's my fault. I just didn't see it coming! I didn't want you to find out at your party. You lied to me and had everyone else lie, too. You knew exactly what would happen if I found out, and you were too cowardly and lazy to deal with me. But how are you gonna take on those people if you're so scared of me? You're no match for them. They'll rip you off. They've known capitalism all their lives. You'll fare no better than the others. But it's not about you. It's about us, all of us. Oh really? Wow, thanks for the memo. I'd almost forgotten. All this time I thought it was just about you. And Daniel needs a real job, not one that's gone in a year. That's what we should strive for. He needs the orphanage as a place where you can hang out, putter around or celebrate, sit in the garden and barbecue. What good will a finished hotel be for him? He won't be able to afford a coffee there. The cellar is damp, mold is everywhere. The orphanage is a ruin. It's not enough to paper over the cracks with paint and electrical work. These investors have the money and know-how. They'll renovate it from the ground up. That's how to maintain it. I know it's important to you, and I'm sorry... Me? It's not about me, for God's sake. It's for the cause. I'm always about the cause. What is it you want to hear from me? I'm not nearly as strong as you. Is that it? Fine, it's true. Your hardness and determination are unmatched. We're all just wusses. Ask your daughter. What? Jens. Jens. When they tore down the school, we agreed. When Lenin was torn from his pedestal, we celebrated together. But if you take everything from people that once had value, you'll have serious problems in the long run. Ask your son Ronnie what he'd prefer. The manor house was built in 1850. It has nothing to do with East Germany. It was my childhood. There must be something in between, in between: "I want to keep the old" and "I want to make everything new." Namely, that we form a future so people aren't humiliated when their life's work -is declared worthless. -Come off it! I love this town as much as you do. And I won't let you claim I'm not trying. Oh God, you used to love that. BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: What? You loved my fire. That was long ago. (CHUCKLES) I understand you're angry. Are you angry? Is that it? Angry that I never responded? Gudrun, it's not always about you. If I sleep with you, do I get the orphanage? Are you nuts? Gudrun. "We're a good fit, Gudrun." BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: Gudrun, stop it. "You need a real man, Gudrun, not a sidekick like Werner." BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: You're crazy. Don't act so chaste. Stop it now. Gudrun, stop it. Get dressed. -No. -Put your clothes on. Take yours off. -I don't want to. Not like this. -Quiet! (MUFFLED) Please don't. Gudrun, stop it. (GROANS) (WHIMPERS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) Oh, God. (BREATHES HEAVILY) Would you please hand me my clothes? At least admit it. BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: That's... backwards. Wait, I'll... I'll get us drinks. Please take off your coat. I wasn't expecting a visitor. -Is red wine alright? -Yeah. PETER: Fine. We could go to the bar downstairs, but to be honest, my wine's better. That's alright. Shall we use our first names? Mm-hmm. -Lara. -Peter. Are you from the East? Is it still audible? Not really. Thank God. It's been a long time. -I fled. -Why? They preferred to beat down freedom-loving people. Those philistines. (EXHALES) I couldn't take much with me. I burned most of my pictures. If you don't want to, -I don't have to. -Yes, yes, yes. Please. I like the darkness in that corner. Mm-hmm. I don't know much about painting. That doesn't matter. It's very well painted. PETER: Yes, I'm a good craftsman. -I meant it as a compliment. -No, you're right. It's well executed but irrelevant. There's nothing unique, real or original. It's only mimicry. Barely a real expression. No, you... nailed it on the head. (CHUCKLES) -Stop your whining. -What? It's a beautiful... Oh, God! Oh God, I gotta go. Sorry, I have to run. Sorry, goodbye! Bye. (♪♪♪♪♪) So, we're going home now. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) WERNER: Don't worry, I won't leave you alone. (LYRICS IN GERMAN) (♪♪♪♪♪) (BREATHES HEAVILY) -Good evening. -Good evening. (SINGING IN GERMAN) Gudrun? Gudrun? MAN ON RADIO: ...computers won't be able to handle the year 2000. Many programs were written decades ago. Back then, computer memory capacity was limited, so programmers limited years to two digits. For example, "60" instead of "1960." That was unproblematic until this year, 1999. But the year 2000 will bring double zero, which will drive computers crazy. For them, zero-zero means back to the year 1900. This may cause chaos. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah? Hello. She's in there. Do something! After you! -Please. -Yeah. You gotta go. This isn't allowed. Leave right now, come on. Come on. (GRUNTS) WERNER: Leave my wife alone! She can sit here. When the investors arrive, she's gone. What are you doing here? (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) -Good morning. -HENRIETTE: Good morning. -I brought rolls. -Well, then. You never give up, right? Gudrun. You can't stay here. You need warmth and this isn't exactly legal. You have to leave. You're freezing cold. I won't play his game, I quit. What does he need a secretary for? I'm packing it in. I had nothing to do with this. I didn't know. He's got this cell phone now. What's next? He must've organized it on that phone behind my back. I would've told you. I don't let you down. Look. I made these for you. Gudrun, why are you doing this to me? Werner, I don't get it. I've always been her friend. I always meant well for her. Believe me, please. I've got tea, sandwiches and meatballs. Please, Werner. She has to believe me. HENRIETTE: That's us two. The previous night, we ran away to the movies. "Fanfan la Tulipe" with Gerard Philippe and Gina Lollobridgida. (BOTH CHUCKLES) We were dead tired. (CHUCKLES) We felt so rebellious. She could be so triumphant when she succeeded. Yeah, it's awful. I always found it thrilling. -The coffee's ready. -I'll get it. And now... she suddenly has a grown-up daughter. But we have it good too, huh, Mommy? Right? Thanks. And... Peter Melzner? Peter Melzner. As a student, I was in a drawing class. So, a classmate and I were able to go to Ahrenshoop. For the holidays. For three weeks. A kind of summer class. It was great, of course. Ahrenshoop! That's where all the artists and celebrities met. Fancy that! And Gudrun, curious as she was, paid us a visit. One afternoon, she showed up. We had our easels on the rocky coast... It was so silly. Of course, we felt incredibly artistic. And the most terrific of them, with a palette in hand and a big hat, and probably smoking a pipe, too... Anyway, it was Peter Melzner. Our teacher. He was extraordinarily talented. He was already an assistant in Halle. We admired him. And Gudrun saw him, and he saw her... and that was it. And then? They were a couple. I didn't see her again those two weeks. Then she suddenly left. And Peter Melzner had a new woman at his side. And then another one. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, and then? I repeatedly tried to reach her. I even went there. No answer. Nothing. She completely disappeared. I never saw her again. It was awful. Truly terrible. LARA: But why? We... neither of us had... things like love, closeness, attachment... We hadn't learned that. But... but that's no reason for her to break off your friendship. Your mother was a very proud woman. (INHALES, EXHALES) -Sorry. -Crying makes people ugly. My mama always said that when I cried. She's got a point there. (SOBS) (SNIFFLES) And I look especially shitty when I cry. (LARA CHUCKLES) (BOTH CHUCKLES) JUTTA: You're ruining it for everyone. Everybody here wants the hotel. Jeez! Jens doesn't mean any harm to you. He just... He wants to redo the orphanage to serve his hometown. What exactly is wrong with that? He loves this place as much as you. You can protest, but not in here. Get out. Get up and get out. You're in the way. Don't you know that? Nobody wants you here. I said get out! Get lost! Get lost, Gu... Do you know how cold you are? You're freezing cold, girl. You need to warm up. You're coming with me, come on. Werner, help me. I can't move her alone. Take her with you. I don't get her. What's the point? Sitting around like a dummy. She's not the centre of the universe. (KIDS LAUGHING) -What are you doing? -Aren't you cold? Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Good day. All's well, Jutta. I canceled. They're coming tomorrow. JUTTA: Thank God. BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: Right, Gudrun. JUTTA: There's no point now. Let's go. BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: Let's... DANIEL: Hello. BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: Who are you? Daniel Poller, from the newspaper. What are you doing here? Where is your colleague Wendlich? I'm the new guy. -Why are you here? -WERNER: Give me your phone. I'd rather not. -So, what are you doing here? -I wanted to ask you that. We're taking care of Mrs. Pfaff. I see. She's really cold. Well, she's been sitting here for a while. Bumped her head and escaped from the hospital. Exactly, we're taking her somewhere warm. Come on, Gudrun. Stop this, let's go. -Come on. -You're coming with us, Gudrun. -(SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) -(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) That's outrageous! How dare you photograph this sick woman? What can you tell me about the protests over the sale of the orphanage? -Protests? -There are none. It's just one sick woman. Everybody else is in favour. -Everybody. -In favour of selling? -What? -She fell. Stop, you can't come. Report to the hospital in two hours. (AMBULANCE REVS) BÜRGERMEISTER JENS: Well... What can I say? We... You need to talk sense into her. Today wasn't okay. We can't have that kind of excitement. It makes one worry. About everyone. About her, us, you... About the future. You have to break it to her and she has to accept it. Basta. It was just before the Wall came down. An East German policeman stopped me on the country road. "Out of the car. License and registration." So, I got out and gave them to him. I stood next to the car. Suddenly he says, "Put out the cigarette." I didn't do it. I asked, "Why?" He was baffled. So, I repeated my question, "Why?" He shrugged, gave me my things and said, "Have a nice day." That was the only time I rebelled. And it wasn't very brave. It was already November. I'm picking up Lara at the station. I'm off. (♪♪♪♪♪) RADIO DJ: This is a string orchestra, consisting of violins, violas, cellos and double basses. These instruments, the four members of the violin family, are similar in everything except size. -Did you wait long? -Ten minutes. Sorry. (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) NURSE: There's a fire! Somewhere over there. Isn't that the orphanage? No, no, wait. I'll show you. Gudrun. How are you? -A fire. -I know. Hi, Mama. GUDRUN: (SIGHS) What are you doing here? -I wanted to see you. -What? I took some days off. I thought I'd zip your dress for a change. -But you don't need to, Lara. -But I'd like to. Excuse me, I'd like to wheel Mrs. Pfaff back to her place now. Just ring if you need anything. Thanks. Look. -I found this at home. -Oh God, it's the... The old fairy tales. You used to read them to me. It's... They told me it was in that basket they left me in at the orphanage. Get some rest, Mama. I'll read to you. "A miller had gradually fallen into poverty. He had nothing left but his old mill and a large apple tree behind it. Then the devil approached him and said, "Why do you toil chopping wood?" I'll make you rich if you promise me what is behind your mill. What could it be but my apple tree?," thought the miller... and said..." (♪♪♪♪♪) (♪♪♪♪♪)
