BILLY: He don't look so good. ANGELA: What, what, what happened? Don't tell me. Oh, my God. SEAN: You killed him. Oh, my God, Cuddles. (CRYING) (TIRES SQUEALING) HARVEY: That looks like Angie's kid. Well someone's gotta find him. Send Joey out if you don't wanna. Because we've been through enough already. (KNOCKING) Damn it. Your brother's here. Harv, Mr. Quinn is bringing him. Tell him I'm too upset to come down. What am I supposed to say? (DOORBELL RINGING) Anything, just get rid of him. Hi Candy... My Mom's upstairs mourning. Our dog just died. SUE: Oh, poor thing. How did it happen? He killed him. You shoulda been there man. He came down out of the tree like (CLAPS), splat. Tell your mother we found him on Hillside Avenue. CANDY: Do you want your coat back? I'll get it another time. Just let him sleep it off. He's gonna have one hell of a headache when he wakes up. Hope he never does. Tell your mother we're sorry and to call us if she needs anything. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hi, Candy. Graduation's coming. Anyone special taking you to the prom? Yeah, special ed. WOMAN: Oh Ed, that's nice. I feel like you've been avoiding me. Your coat's been waiting for you to come and get it. I don't think this is the place. He won't be in our way any longer. Angela, he's your son. He was never in the way. Hi, Angie, how's Danny? I was just tellin' Harvey, he's doing great. He's got a job and his own place now. Oh, that's so wonderful. Yeah, he's livin' out is Maspeth. That far? I know, we don't get to see as much as we'd like to of him anymore. We have to go. Okay, bye. Here, go to grandma. Where'd you get the love bite? Do people call you Candy 'cause you're so sweet? 'Cause I imagine you could give a guy cavities. My dad named me after his Mom. Who's your friend? It's a customer, Billy. EDDIE: What's happenin' bro? You see that? She's with me. EDDIE: You see that? United States Marines. - Billy. - Why you still here, man? Guys, please. EDDIE: I don't think you wanna mess with me, man. But for Candy's sake, I'll go over there. Why does he know your name? I thought you didn't talk to any guys. Are you serious? I got your name on my arm, how much more serious could I get, okay? Look, when I love something, I protect it, okay? You're my most precious property. Property? Do you want him? - What's goin' on here? - Huh? I asked you a question, hostess. What are you doing, get the fuck off her. Excuse me? I said, get off, man. Hey. Candy you all right? BILLY: Hey! (thudding) Hey, fuck you, man. (PHONE RINGING) SUE: Hello? Hello? BILLY: You look like death. I almost lost my job today. Please, ain't like it's rocket science, all right? Those burger joints are a dime a dozen. At least I have a job. I need my steak back. I need to be able to trust you. Garlic. ♪ These are the signs of the end of the end ♪ (SIZZLING) Your letter came. Looks like nursing school will have you after all. What happened to you? Why'd you have Danny committed? It doesn't concern me. Oh but it can concern me when I gotta drive around all night lookin' for him? Oh, poor you. Your brother needs help. Yeah, for his drinkin'. He's a drunk, he's not a crazy. I'm his mother, God damn it. I know what's good for him, you hear me? Right. Putting him away so you can have an affair with Mr. Quinn.

I share a room with this vet, which is great 'cause he tells me all these stories about all the people he's offed, you know? Makes me a little jealous. I probably woulda turned out a little better if I was allowed to go over there and shoot some fucking bastards, right? (SIGHS) There he is, the vet. That guy's your roommate? Dude's been here like six years. They call him a lifer 'cause they don't think they'll ever let him go. Sick bastard. It'll probably be me soon enough. You're not a lifer, Danny. Be outa here in no time. Yeah, and then what? I can't go home, I mean, she don't want me. Truthfully I don't think she ever did. I see your boyfriend's marking his territory again. What, you can't talk to me anymore? Just me or all the guys? Aw, now you're hurtin' me. Want some donuts? Huh? I was wondering if you could run across the street and get us some donuts?

Do I need to repeat myself? MALE EMPLOYEE: What do you want me to do about it? You're on thin ice, mister. I'm gonna show you what you have to do. Follow me. What happened? One of the Creedmorian's flung their shit on the walls. It's stuck on the ceilings, the mirrors, it's everywhere, man. CANDY: You sure it was a Creedmorian? I don't know, but I'm not cleaning it up. He can fire me, but I'm not cleaning it up. I saw you talkin' to that guy. You watching me now? My shifts not done for another 20 minutes. Did you talk to any guys today? Yeah, that one. Any that weren't coworkers? You're gonna get me in trouble. Did you? Yes, Billy, I did, okay? Who? Let me see there was the guy that needed more ketchup, the guy that found a hair in the ranch dressing, the guy that needed more napkins 'cause his daughter had a spill, who else? Yeah and they hit on you, right? Yes, Billy, they all wanted me. They all wanted to do me right there one after the other on the salad bar. You're not funny. You're not. Making me crazy with all these questions. I think we need a break. Why, so you can go date that marine? You're insane. Do you think I'm a jerk off? We can't break up, what about my tat?

I have to talk to Father Jerry if I wanna keep living in the house. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, she thinks that homo is gonna set me straight. I'm supposed to be there now, talking to him. Don't go. Wait here, I gotta finish my shift, we'll figure something out. I'm not allowed home until I talk to him. Just wanted to tell you. (DOOR LATCHING) Someone made a mess in the mens room. I need you to clean it up. I'm a hostess. Cleaning the bathroom isn't one of my duties. Now it is. But all my side work is done, I gotta go home. You can't leave until it's done. You can't keep me captive. You just want me to do it so you don't have to. It'll take you two minutes, then you're free to leave. (GASPS) All done? Of course, you knew I'd do it.
