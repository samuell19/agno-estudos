(smooth jazz music) (vehicles whooshing) (metallic rattling) (pedestrians chattering) (music drowns out voices) - [Man] This one, (music drowns out voice) here, got the automatic (music drowns out voice). (groovy jazz music) (truck beeping) - Hi, Melanie. - Oh, hey, Jim, I'm sorry. I can't believe how late I'm running. (thudding) - I'm early. - [Melanie] Come on, Billy. - (faint speaking) It's like a war out there. (thudding) - Well, stay warm. - 'Night, Marty. - Bye, Jim. - 'Night. - [Marty] Hey, Jim, Howard can't make it tonight. - Why, he's working overtime again? - Oh, no, his wife is sick. He was gonna speak for me tonight. - Hey, listen, man, you don't wanna know what's goin' on with me. - When was the last time you spoke at a meeting? - About seven months ago, why, you don't remember? - You need it. - Hey (chuckles). - Hi, how you doin'? - Okay, I'm okay, how you doin'? (exclaims) (faint speaking) Doing good. - Yeah. - I'm doing good. - Doing all right, you look great. - Hey, Marty. - Hey, Tony, well, it's day 25. - 26. - 26, great. Your sponsor's in the kitchen. - Okay. - Get the fuck outta here, fucking way. Hey. - How you doing, Jimmy? - How you doing, good to see you. Listen, I called you back, but I got your machine so, uh, you know, it didn't pick up or something, you know? - Yeah, well, I didn't get the message but-- - No, no, I called you. - All right, whatever, you-- - How you doin'? - I'm all right. Well, I'm upset, I'm angry, I'm, I'm nervous. I'm angry, you know-- - Why, the resume again? - (sighs) The resume, man, you know, the resume already, you know, I'm like I go to the computer place or the printing whatever the hell it is, I go there to pick it up, I hand over the 25 bucks. - Right. - Which is ridiculous. Then I go to a diner to pick up my 579th cup of coffee you know, I gotta refuel, gotta refuel, another cup of coffee, it's 11 o'clock and I'm still tired, but I'm wired, tired and wired. So, I leave, I walk two blocks, look at this hand, then I look at this hand, shaking, oops, no resume-- - Hey, Tony, let me ask you-- - Back in the diner-- - Tony. - What? - You wanna hear this? - Yeah, I heard it already. - You don't care, then I don't care. - Tony, hey, did you drink today? - (exhales sharply) No, but I'll tell ya, I'd love a nice Mexican with a lime, you know, I just wanna get wasted, man. - So what, you're an alcoholic. - Yeah, definitely. - Yeah. So then why don't you go out there and put some fuckin' ashtrays on the chairs, all right? Go on. - Yeah. - Hey, Tony, help me out here. Let's move the chair. - No, no, no, leave it-- - You're just, you're making it harder. - Leave it, leave it. - [Debbie] Hey Marty, what's up? - [Marty] Debbie, glad you made it. - Yeah, right. - Hey. - Hey there, how you doin', Jasmine? - (chuckles) I'm doin' good, what is this? - It's a cotton animal that I slaughtered and-- - Uh-huh (laughs). - No, I don't like fur. I don't wear fur, I'm against it, I love this lame. - Child, isn't it nice? - Jasmine, I'm, I'm reading the Bible. - You readin' the Bible? - Mm-hm. - Where, where'd you start? - In the beginning. - Uh-huh, good. - Yeah, you think that's good? (Jasmine laughs) I'm still smoking though, Marty did you bust out and buy some hot cocoa-- - [Marty] Put some more in the baskets. - The little packages, they're very cheap. - [Marty] Yeah. - Yeah, Marty, she's readin' the Bible. - Well, don't tell her how it turns out. - No, they've known since this morning that Dr. Rubin was gonna cover for me, mm-hmm. Now I'm sure he's there, yes, just page him. Yes, I'll be back in an hour, okay. - Hey, skinny, you spare some change for alcohol research? Fine, you can keep it. (Jasmine laughing) - Come on (faint speaking). - All right. (people chattering) (laughing) - [Marty] Carol, can you read the preamble for us? Shelley, would you (faint speaking)? - [Shelley] Oh yes. (group chattering) - These always go first, you know? - Yeah. - Get a long black coat. - [Marty] Change your mind yet? - Marty, no. - [Marty] Why? - 'Cause I'm not in the mood, that's why. - What's eatin' you? - I just don't feel like talkin' about it, all right? - When you're asked to talk, you say yes, you know that. - Yeah, there are no rules in AA (scoffs). - Now come on, help me out. I need, I need to hear a real war story tonight. - Then go fuckin' rent Apocalypse Now, really, get off my back. - Shh. - Come on, Marty. Jesus Christ, all right, happy? - Gotcha (faint speaking). And here to share his experience, strength and hope with us tonight is Jim. - Come on, Jim. (group clapping) - Hi, I'm Jim, and I'm an alcoholic. - [Group] Hi Jim. - And there's no escaping from that because that's who I am. Yeah, you know, I could, I could take a little kid to the zoo or I could make an egg cream or I can even ride a fucking camel if I wanted, but what I can't do is have a fucking drink, and that's all that matters, one drink, just one, you know what I mean? I've been a drunk and a drug addict for 25 years and I'm sick of it, I really didn't wanna be up here tonight, but Marty cornered me, so what's my story? I was born an only child to a really, really sweet angelic Italian woman and to a poor, fucking embarrassed-to-be-Jew father, Saul, or as he preferred to be called in the neighborhood, Sal, when I was nine, I made a xylophone out of Saul's empties. I took them to school for show and tell, and that was the very first time and the only time that my father beat the shit out of me, pulled the belt right out of his pants, had a Joe DiMaggio buckle on it. Imagine that, Joe D, and he whipped the shit outta me. That night, I stole a bottle from my dad, a whole pint. (chuckles softly) Scotch. Man, did I sleep, like a fucking top. By the time I got outta high school, I was a daily drinker. Thank God I landed a job at a steakhouse in the Theater District, I could drink around the clock. I was hiding it, you know, I'd be pouring it in a fucking styrofoam cup. You know, we figure like no one ever fucking knows. Trust me, by, you know, midnight, I was seating people on the fucking roof. I started getting up to about a quart a day after about three years, a quart a day, that's all, that ain't nothin', you know why? 'Cause I wasn't even gettin' drunk anymore on a quart a day, I mean I wasn't even gettin' high, where is that at? That's when I started doing heroin. I wasted 10 years of my life, strung out, broke, alone, except for my only friend, some Ninth Avenue hooker, Tanya. I mean, I knew about AA and all that shit. I had some little shit-faced neighbor of mine, he took me to a meeting, ah, fuck that. I thought it was for boozers, man. Holy rollers, Bowery bums, I didn't need it, fuck that. Do it on my own, man, kick dope. Shit, I once went a whole month, just to prove to myself that I could do it on my own. I didn't even smoke a fucking cigarette, that's how cool I was and then, I met my goddess. Oh, man, did we fall in love. It was the greatest, the greatest feeling. Gawd, we started going out, couple weeks, boom, moved in with her. I mean I was still drinking and she didn't know that I was an alcoholic, I mean she used to drink champagne with friends and I used to join her, you know, it's a celebration, she didn't know, what did she have to know, you know what I mean? I wasn't druggin' or anything, just drinkin'. Then I asked her to marry me. She said yes, wow, oh, Jesus Christ, I was in heaven. Till I had one of those disasters. She took me to meet her family, all 200 of them. I couldn't deal with it, I guess I just freaked. I go upstairs and I never, ever come back. I passed out, boy, that pint went fast. She got me into a cab, we got back to New York and she looked at me and she says, "I love you, I'll marry you, but you're going "into rehab or I'm history." Well, I checked right in. I had no choice, I loved her. I was sober, we were like a regular married couple. (chuckles softly) We went on picnics and took rides on the Staten Island Ferry. That was almost three years ago. A lot of you know about eight months ago, Janie died. Just like that, brain aneurism. Oh, man, sometimes I go home now and I still expect to see her there, you know? Gawd, I wish I would've made love to her a little more. If only I woulda known. You know, I guess I'm just fighting it today. (exhales sharply) Christ, you wanna know the truth? I just wanna get high! I just don't understand it anymore, you know? I just don't get it. I mean I know that Janie just had to go, I guess, you know? But I mean I, I never knew love like that, before her. I just don't wanna be with anybody else. Fuck! (bangs) (sighs) But, hey, you know, the guy that brought me into this room, (sighs) he said you know don't think, don't drink, and go to a meeting. And that's, that's worked for me a day at a time. Thanks. (group clapping) - In accordance with the seventh tradition, it's time to pass the baskets, so give what you can. If you can't, keep coming back. We need you more than we need the money. Okay, now, any visitors from-- - Gonna get some air. - Uh, visitors from out of town or anybody new that's been in these rooms that wants to say hi? - I knew you had money. - Hi, my name is Rachel. I'm an alcoholic and an addict. - Hi Rachel. - Welcome. - Anybody counting days? - Yeah, my name's Tony and I'm a drunk and I have 26 days today. (group applauding) - Yay. - [Tony] Thanks. - Yeah, hi, my name is Dennis and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Dennis. - Hi. And I have 72 days. (group applauding) - [Woman] All right (faint speaking). - Look, Jim, I just want you to know that I know it, I know it was hard for you, but it meant so much to me. You spoke the truth. - It was fairy tale. A big lie. - Wait a minute. What can we do, all right, we got one day at a time, that's all we do, c'mon. (group clapping) (applause drowns out voice) - Substance abuser. - Hey, put those cookies back, shame on you. (clapping drowns out voice) - Debbie, alcoholic, I got 90 days. (group clapping) Rock, rock! - [Marty] Anybody else counting days? - [Charlie] Hi, my name is Charlie and I'm an alcoholic. (heels clicking) (group clapping) (doors rattling) - Is anybody else celebrating an anniversary tonight? - Hi, my name is Terry and I'm an alcoholic. - [Group] Hi Terry. - (chuckles softly) And I'm confused about my anniversary because I'm not sure if I should count the days I was tied up in a straitjacket or not. If not, tonight's a year. (group clapping) - I think it counts. - Joseph, drug addict, alcoholic. By the grace of God, one day at a time, I got two years. - All right. (group clapping) (chuckles) All right. - Now, okay, according to the 12th Tradition, anonymity is the chief spiritual foundation of our program, ever reminding us to place principles above personalities. What you see here and what you hear here, leave here. Where the hell is Jim, hey, Jim! All right, we'll continue the meeting with a show of hands. - Hi, I'm Shelley and I'm an alcoholic. - [Group] Hi Shelley. - My mother is in town and she is staying with me in my bedroom in my bed with me (chuckles softly). I'm just a little too old to be sleeping with my mother. (grunts softly) You know, if I could crawl out of my skin, I would. I would, I would, I would, and as it is, I hardly breathe and I pray to God that she's not able to hear me when I'm lying down next to her. Today, I am running all over the place 'cause (faint speaking) is my mother's birthday coming up (exhales sharply) tomorrow and she doesn't need anything. She's loaded, loaded. And you know what I'd like to get her? I'd like to get her exactly, I would like to get her chocolate-covered (blows raspberry) Valium-- (group chuckles) Or (scoffs) I know what, a good hit of Ecstasy, now that, that, I would like to see on something like that. (group chuckling) I know I'm overreacting, and she tells me enough times that I'm overreacting, so but I'm in the middle of it right now and I can't see my way out, you know? So but I have to remember that I am a survivor, that I survived alcoholism and not to mention the tender loving care of my mother, so I can survive this, right? (chuckles) I'm shaking like crazy. I think, I think, I think, I think, I really think that my, my parents are fine people and they're just not the way that I wanted them to be. Thanks (chuckles). - Thanks for sharing. - Thanks. (smooth jazz instrumental music) - [Man] I don't know what's going on with Jim. - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he's fine, I'm gonna find him. I'll find him. - Okay, well, let's go back to the show of hands. (groovy instrumental music) - Jimmy, Jimmy, it's Tony, pick it up, pick it up. You screen your calls, come on, pick it up. Okay, listen, do me a favor, I want you to call 555-1234 when you get in, it's the phone booth in the hall. Just wanna know that you're okay, all right? (record scratching music) - (sighs) Hi, my name is Jim and I want a pint of bourbon. Fuck, ah (grunts) fuck. (cars honking in the distance) (glass thudding) Man, fuck! Oh, gah, son of a bitch. It's the first drink that gets you drunk. It's the first drink that-- (glass thudding) Ah. Oh, fuck you in the ass, you fuck. - See, two years ago today, I had my last drink, my last blackout, and it was the last time I saw my wife and little boy. I, uh, was drinking all morning and I had to go up to to the Bronx, check my little boy and drop him off with his grandmother and then I had some business to take care of. Next thing I knew, I, uh, I woke up in jail in a cell by myself. I, I, I said oh, shit, when I woke up, you know, like oh, fuck, done got picked up for drunk driving or some shit like that, so I walked over to where, um, the guard was standing and I said, uh, give me a cigarette and he wouldn't turn around and he wouldn't say nothing. So I said, come on, man, give me a fucking cigarette! He still wouldn't, uh, turn around, so I said, okay, man, let me make my fucking phone call. Let me call my wife, she don't know where I'm at. She's worried, she don't know where the fuck I am. Let me call my wife and my little boy. Then (exhales sharply) this motherfucker turned around and he looked at me and he said, "What the fuck are you talking about! "Don't you remember what you did?" I said, remember what? He said, um, he said, "Your little boy was in car with you "and he went through the windshield and now, "he's at the ICU at Bellevue." Now, I love my little boy. I used to put him in a stroller, push him around for people to see and now, I had his blood on my hands, you know? I am feeling fucking crazy tonight. I am scared! I'm scared, Jim freaked the fuck outta me. We used to get fucked up together, and now, I'm afraid I'm gonna do something crazy to somebody or maybe to myself and I don't wanna do that. I just don't wanna do that, goddamn, my little boy. He was only five years old. I'm just so mad at my fucking self 'cause I cannot drink! Dammit. Uh, I think I better stop talking now. I think I better... it'll be better if I just listen to y'all talk because if I hadn't a-been a fucking blackout alcoholic, none of this would've happened, am I gonna pick up again? Fuck if I know. I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try not to, that's all I can say. Just thanks. (group muttering) - Hey, Jimmy. - How are you? - Long time. - Yeah. - Good to see you. - Give me a pint, will you? - You don't need it, Jim. - Oh, don't tell me what I fucking need, come on. - [Harry] Why are you gonna do this to yourself? It's been two years. - Oh, come on. I don't need a fucking lecture. - Take your business somewhere else, I don't need it. - Spare me the bullshit. (metallic rattling) What the fuck is this all about - What's the magic word? - Oh. Holy mackerel. - What are you doing, Jim? - What am I doing? I'm comparison shopping. - Well, you're not drinking (faint speaking) - I lived, Harry. I fucking lived, you wore that vest every day 18 hours behind that fucking register, man, not me. You're the sucker. - You're a lousy fucking drinker and a pain-in-the-ass drunk, Jim. - Oh, yeah? Holy Christ, you got that good shit from Passaic, New Jersey, you son of a bitch, Harry, you motherfucker you. - You wanna walk out or you wanna bounce out, Jim? - Come on, let's celebrate, you motherfucker. Happy new year, Harry, happy fucking new year. - All right, come on. - What? - His machine (faint speaking) machine. - Yeah, hello, Jimmy, you boob. What did you go running outta here for? Come on, man. - Yeah, come on, man. We get, go. - (chuckles) Go, you-- - People here love you, man, I mean, but, you know, I can't handle these whiners without you, man, so come on. You gotta call. - We love you. - We love you. - We love you. - Yeah, so call 555-1234, all right? Shelley's here. - Bye-bye, bye-bye. - Bye-bye. (exhales sharply) I'm worried, you know? I'm worried about him. - It's okay. - Yeah. - It's okay, we're okay. (faint speaking) - Hi, I'm Francine and I got a drinking problem. I'm also a spend-aholic and I'm fun at parties. I'm really in a tizzy today. I was at Strawberries today twice and I couldn't find anything to buy, I mean, I'm just looking for that perfect pair of boots and the salesgirl was useless, but I was nice to her 'cause I'm such a people pleaser. I mean, I did, I wanted to yell at her, but I'm trying to keep the focus on myself. I mean, this is a selfish program, and through this program, I've gotten to know me and frankly, I love her. You know, it feels really good to be here tonight. It feels like a party actually, I mean, since I've been coming to AA, I haven't been to any parties. I haven't needed to, I mean all you people, you're like my entertainment committee. I mean I hardly even watch TV anymore, I used to. I used to tape all of my soap operas 'cause I'm such like a drama queen, but I don't need to anymore because of all the drama that goes on in this room. Last week, I was at a meeting and I saw, you know, what's that George guy, that hunk who plays that brain surgeon guy on General Hospital? I mean in the flesh, right? And the way Jimmy is struggling with a tragedy in his life, it's just horrible, it almost, it's like too much for me sometimes, like I can't bear it 'cause like I never drank like that. I mean I was like, what do you call where I was a social imbiber, that's what I was. Hey, but since I've been coming to these rooms, I haven't touched one drop and I've got a couple of months. I love listening to all your stories. They're really, they're so sweet. I wasn't that bad of an alcoholic. Actually, to tell you the truth, sometimes, I think I'm not really an alcoholic at all, I was just born, you know, thirsty, you know what I mean? Like thirsty. (group laughing) (steps clicking) (cars whooshing) (sighs) (train rattling) - Right now, I'm living with my mother. My little brother Malik, he's 16, and my daughter, she's four and we're one on top of each other. It's a railroad flat and the bathroom is in the hallway. And I'm out of the house most of time at least. I go to school at night and I try to work at Macy's as much as I can and I'm even taking singing lessons. (chuckles softly) It's something I always wanted to do. But I, I, I came home early last night though, and when I went into the bathroom, I saw my little brother Malik sitting on the toilet bowl and he had his belt tied around his arm and he was shooting up. He's using my mother's needles, she's a diabetic so she uses the needles for insulin and it threw me back, you know, 'cause I used to steal her needles too (scoffs) when I was using, she knew, but what she gonna do? She told me she loved me and she's gonna find out about Malik, you know, it's just a matter of time. It's gonna break her heart, you know, she doesn't need this kind of problem, but so I slapped him and we had a fight and he hasn't been home since last night. My mother's mad at me. I don't know what I would say to him, you know, when I see him. Well, what hurts is that I feel responsible because I remember when he was a kid, he, uh, he busted me in the same situation in the bathroom, you know, he saw me, threatened to tell but he didn't because he said he loved me (chuckles softly). He thought his big sister was cool. Well, his big sister is not cool because his big sister is HIV positive. He knows, you know, I want him to stop, but he won't listen to me 'cause I'm, I'm, no example to listen to, you know. I'm not afraid of dying, you know. I'm afraid of getting sick 'cause I know what that's like. I seen some of my friends go through that and I don't wanna go through that, you know? I want the cycle to end here, you know? I want it to end with me. I don't know how I got it, you know, it could've been through sex, it could've been through needles, who knows? It doesn't matter, you know, all I know is I keep thinking, you know, why not have a drink when you got AIDS (chuckles) right, you know? But that's just my alcoholism talking, you know, looking for any excuse to have a drink, you know? But the fact is I'm gonna die, you know, so is everybody. (chuckles softly) (sniffles) I feel good, you know, right now. (sniffles) And I wanna watch my little girl grow up, and drinking's not gonna cure me, you know? It's only gonna (sniffles) make me die sooner, so I mean, you know, I don't have time, you know, but, but (sniffles) you know, I do know that I wanna die sober, that's it (chuckles softly). (thudding) - Tanya, oh, Tanya. Come on, you know who this is. It's your knight and shining vodka, baby. Tanya, come on, it's Jim, let me in. I'm in love with you again, Tanya, come on, come on out. I'm having a party, Tanya, come on. Come on, I meant to call you, but I lost your hallway, Tanya, honey, that's a joke, remember me? Oh, Tanya, Tanya (faint speaking). (answering machine beeping) - [Tony] Jimmy, Jimmy, it's Tony, pick it up. Come on, pick it up, hey, listen. Do me a favor, want you to call 555-1234 when you get in, it's the phone booth in the hall. Just wanna know that you're okay, all right? Okay, gave us a little surprise there (faint speaking). (answering machine beeping) (faint speaking) - [Shelley] You boob what did you go running outta here for? - Come on, man, go. - Go. - [Tony] People here love you, man, I mean, but you know, I can't handle these whiners without you, man, so come on. You gotta call. - We love you. - We love you. - Love you. Love you. - Yeah, so call 555-1234, all right, Shelley's here. - Bye-bye, bye-bye. - [Tony] Bye-bye. (answering machine beeps) (gulps) (sighs) - Oh, shit. (glass rattles) (exhales sharply) - You wanna talk about bad blackouts? I was married in one. (woman laughs) I was married in a blackout, I'm serious. I was 19 years old, I was married for six weeks, yeah. I was married to this guy named Wild Bob. That was his full name, Wild Bob, so I guess I was Mrs. Wild Bob, hi everyone, welcome to my life. (chuckles) Do you, Debbie, take Wild Bob to be your lawfully wedded husband, I do. Gawd, he was a rock musician like Gregg Allman, now what could I do? I'm a sucker for musicians, yeah, so I've been in and out of these rooms about four or five times now. I'd say it took me 2 1/2 years to get 90 days of sobriety. That's a lot of drinking. I don't know, I think I was pissed off that I didn't grow up in the '60s and partied with Janis Joplin, you know what I mean? And everyone had that long hair and the music was great, peace, love, the clothes, you know? You know what pisses me, hi, hi, how are you? Good, great, you're late, you know, I wanted to speak about this two weeks ago and no one called on me and now, whatever, so what was I saying? I think what I was doing, I was trying to relive the '60s in the '80s and it just didn't work out for me, you know? I got stuck somewhere in the middle, but gawd, I wanted to be Janis Joplin so bad, so bad, man. She was great, she was so great, gawd. She was incredible, but whatever, whatever I did, I did, you know, I had a good time doing it and now, it's over. Oh my god (chuckles) I'm so sad, no I'm strange. I'm a strange bird, I know, I'm weird. I've started doing physical things to relieve the stress. I've gotten into sports now, watching them. I love NFL football, I love NFL football. Jerry Rice of the 49ers, he is so great. He is so great, and Barry Sanders, I love him. Gawd, he's great, I love watching football and I've become political for the first time in my life. I went to the march in Washington, the pro-choice march. It was exhilarating, Helen Reddy sang I Am Woman. I freaked, I freaked, it was incredible. I swear, I'm such a dyke sometimes, I'm such a dyke. You know, I mean I'm not attracted to women, but I feel like politically that I could be a lesbian, you know, that whatever, but yeah, the march was great. The march was really great, I think it was like the closest thing that I ever got to living in the '60s, you know? And I met some people in these rooms who were active drinkers and users in the '60s and they said that all that peace and love that they were looking for and, and, whatever, hoping to find, that they found in these rooms. I think I know what they mean, you know, I see what they mean, I mean I can, I could be the Janis Joplin of the Holiday Inn circuit if I want to. If I want to, I'll just be her clean and sober, you know? ♪ When you pass by, my pulse starts beating fast ♪ ♪ My love's so strong that it just lasts and lasts ♪ (music drowns out voice) ♪ I can't help myself for the way I feel ♪ ♪ Help myself for my love is real ♪ - Oh, dangerous. ♪ Help myself for the way ♪ ♪ I feel about you ♪ - Mm. ♪ I must be mad ♪ ♪ I must be mad ♪ ♪ I must be mad ♪ - Janie. ♪ I must be mad, oh, yeah ♪ (energetic electric guitar rock music) ♪ Yeah, oh ♪ (exhales sharply) (thuds) - My son got, um, got caught yesterday walking out of a record store with seven CDs in his backpack and Steven's 12 now and he has a record of misdemeanors. His therapist, who's known him since he was six, and whose children I think I've put through school several times (chuckles) thinks that maybe he should go live with his father. I'm scared out of my mind that if Steven moves out that I'll drink. When I got sober, I made a secret vow to myself. I promised myself that I would stay sober as long as Steven was there and I did. One day at a time, I did, you know? But there's a wall calendar (chuckles) in my head with, um, very big red letters, it says: when he leaves, you can drink. You know, I used my, I used my boy, I used him to (chuckles) hang on to my husband, I used him to stay sane when I was I was drinking. I used him to get sober and stay sober. What about him? You know (scoffs) he was life to me. And I'd come home and I'd feel his warmth and I, it'd take away some of the emptiness that I felt (sighs) (chuckles) I could read him a nursery rhyme or I could cuddle with him, you know. The trouble was that I was drunk, you know, four-year-old boy cuddling every night with a drunken mother. I remember him sitting at the kitchen table, you know, me coming in, guzzling big bottle and his face, you know, his face (chuckles softly) looking at me, I knew it wasn't right. Even after all this time, I find it so hard, so hard to accept this. I mean why, why do I have to be powerless. Why do I have to? (sighs) Why do I got to go to AA to tell me how to be with my son, you know, it's an instinct for Christ's sake! All I wanna do is love my son. (sniffles) They said I have to walk through the fear, innit? Do the thing you fear and dread to do the most, my sponsor says. I'm a mother. I'm a sober mother, and I have to do what's right for my son. How can I be of service to him? I think I'll ask him what he wants to do. What a concept (chuckles softly).

(Tanya mumbling) - [Group] Hi Rachel. - I'm working 18 hours a day. Most nights, I just sleep on the sofa in my office, but, um, last night, I, I wanted to go home and um, so I left the hospital about 2:00 a.m. And I walked across the parking lot to my car and um, I got in the car and um, the next thing I know, a policeman is rapping on the window saying, "Let me see your license, let me see your registration, what "are you doing in the parking lot at 4:30 in the morning?" I was freezing cold, I just sort of felt numb and I couldn't think and I couldn't talk and uh, flashlight, you know, searching the car and looking at me and finally, he noticed the sticker on my windshield, he said, "Are you a doctor at this hospital?" (chuckles) I said, yep, that's it, that's what I'm doing here, I said, yeah, that I was a doctor at this hospital. I've been working long hours and I fallen asleep in the car. He walked me back to the hospital and then gave me a long lecture on the danger of parking lots and get some coffee and get some sleep, so I was sitting in my office this morning and I was thinking a lot about the last time I passed out in a car and I thought of this man here, Joseph, because I had two kids in the back. I wasn't driving, I just passed out but the windows were rolled up and the car was locked and the kids were screaming and it was sweltering hot and the people who heard the kids couldn't wake me up and the police woke me up that time too. I, uh, turned myself into the hospital and I told them that I had been stealing Demirel from my patients for about two years and I had always been a big scotch drinker. In the hospital, put me in detox and they put me in rehab and they put me in a halfway house with other doctors like me and then they took me back. They put me on probation but they took me back to the hospital and I worked, I worked, I worked, I worked. I stayed straight, stayed clean, I stayed sober and I worked. Now, I was thinking that I lost my children and I lost my husband, I lost my home (exhales sharply) but I've always had my work. It's never let me down, but this morning, I was thinking about the similarity between what my life is now as a well-respected doctor and what my life was then and it came sort of clear to me that I have isolated myself, um, in this crowd of doctors and crowd of patients who were always needing me (sighs) that I've isolated myself the same way as I used to do when I was taking Demirel and scotch and then I thought to myself, you know, why would I do this? Why would I do this? And then I thought to myself, well, I think the reason is because I have not done the work of AA. I have not done the thing of looking at how I blew up my life. And um, I guess that's why I'm here because I need help to get back to my sponsor and I need help to get back home to my home group and I need to do the real work, the real work, which I had never done. Thank you, that's my purse. (chuckles) Those are my cigarettes, thank you. Thank you. ♪ Well, here in my heart, there's a story untold ♪ ♪ Of a girl I wanted for my own-- ♪ - Excuse me, I reserved this three years ago. - Yeah, holy shit, man (chuckles) how you been?

(laughs loudly) What happened to this, where the fuck is Jack Dempsey's picture, man, what do they do here? - New management. - Oh, new management. And we are powerless over it, makes our lives unmanageable. - What kind of shit is that, man? (laughs) - Barkeep! Barkeep! Hey, I'm looking for the barkeep. Who are you? - My name's Rich. - That's nice, where's the bartender? (laughs) No really. Where's the fucking bartender? You look like a fucking clothes designer, man. What is this shit, no, really, who are you? Who is he? - This is Jim. - Hey, Jim. - What are you, a matchmaker? What is your name? - My name's Rich. - No, really, where's Anthony? - I bought him out six months ago. I take he opened a strip club out in Jersey. - Oh, but he's happy, though, huh? (laughs) Okay, that's good. Well, listen, I really have to make sure that you're an experienced mixologist, my friend. - Drinking since I was 12. - You have? Good for you, okay, 'cause I need a proficient, proficient booze mechanic, okay? Are you available for that job? (laughing) Set him up. Doubles for everybody, okay, I'll have a whiskey and I'll have a beer, in fact, how does that sound? - That'd be great. - Whoo. Oh, gawd, look, they have charities now. Does Mother Teresa hang here too? I knew she drank. (chuckles softly) Thank you, okay, here is to everyone and fuck everything. - No good (laughs). - I, um, feel like I should say something, I (clears throat) my name is Louis Tingley and I'm not, I don't, I think I'm an alcoholic. I'm, I'm stunned, actually, by this. I came to this church for a choir practice and when I came, I guess I was a bit fuzzy on the dates. No one was there, so it was only second, second time, so my eyesight isn't the greatest and I wandered downhill looking for the men's room and well, I thought all of you were the choir taking a break at first, you see, and I got drawn into the stories. I have to say, I've never, they're so real and honest, they're, they're, I mean nothing compares to it on television or in most movies. I got pulled in and I thought, my god, I had no idea that the choir had so many problems. (group chuckles) And then the more I listened to your stories, the more I realize that, uh, well, I'm really not a drunk. I'm not a sober either, I'm, I'm, I guess I'm a fuzzy. That's what I'd call it, I drink to get fuzzy and I like getting fuzzy every day. It's not that I don't don't know what sober is. I mean I come from New England, I come from a long line of sober people, when they're drunk, they're sober. Most of them are a little drunk every night after five, but I have to say, um, I will be honest, I admit it, I'm a hophead. I like beer, sometimes boilermakers, you know, one or two shots Irish, not on the side, but I like to drop the shot right into the mug and watch it boil and foam up. And if there's a higher power, I can't believe that higher power didn't create barley and hops and allow them to sit there and ferment and God created beer, but not light beer. (group laughs) It's the devil's work or man's work. Actually, I grew up with the Bible, you wouldn't believe it. My mother read the Bible to me and I like that. I remember that stuff in the Bible. There is a season for everything under heaven and a time and I think there's a time for drinking, you know, every day between five and 10:00 or six and 11:00, but I never drink alone, no, I drink at the, around the corner at the Pegasus. They have, gawd, I think they have seven draft beers there, including the queen of beers, the Guinness Stout, but you see, it's so nice to have an activity to keep me away, to celebrate, like I, that's part of why I'm staying here, why I wanted to go to choir practice, I needed something, you know, like in the Bible or in the beer ads on television, we've had a great ballgame, now let's have a cold one to celebrate. A cold one is a euphemism, I guess. I don't imagine having one beer. I can't imagine anyone just drinking one beer if it was any good, what am I saying? Everyone's quiet, I'm thrown back on myself. Perhaps I'm saying that I need like an objective constraint outside of myself to stop me from, you know, like in the case of the choir, a singing super ego to stop me from rushing off to the bar and then I'll have something to celebrate. I, I, I, what I'm saying, I think, is that I prefer your narratives to their hymns. I'd like to come here every night and listen to stories and tell stories, I really never talked like this before. You see, what I wanted to ask if I could stay on here is, well, I know you're supposed to be special and I do have that feeling, I wanted to be a nondrinking drinker, I'm not drinking now, you see. I don't have any, it's, I don't, it's not on me, but I will drink, I will, after I leave this special occasion, I will go onto the next special occasion around the corner, the Pegasus, and watch Henry pour a slow draft of Double Diamond and watch its amber head foam up and lift it to my lips and feel its foam on my mustache and slide down like liquid bread and then to bed and... but thank you for letting me talk.

Someday, I'm gonna be able to have a few drinks and I'm gonna be able to walk away from it. And yeah, yeah, I know that's the wrong way to think. I know I'm just at the beginning of something, okay? I know that, but you know, I have to sit here and I have to listen to all you guys talk about how grateful you are, and it, it, it makes me just, you know, pray for the day when I can sit here and I can be grateful too, you know, when I can be just right where, where, um, where you are. I don't feel any better today than I did the first day I walked in here, like right now, more than anything in the world, all I really wanna do is I wanna drink. I just, I wanna drink, I wanna drink, I wanna drink and then I wanna drink some more. And, yeah, you know, I know that it's, uh, it's my choice, but it's not really because (scoffs) I need it. I mean me sitting here right now is really just a bunch of horse shit 'cause (scoffs) I picked up this morning. I drank, I had a shot, I smoked a joint. I had to, I had to get through it, you know? And you know what, I hate to tell you this, but it helped me, you know, I only had one. I didn't black out, but I needed that one to just get me through it, you know, to calm me down. And I don't think anybody can really understand me for that. See, uh, I was gonna go out and I was gonna get drunk tonight but, you know, I had this plan, but for some reason, I came here and I guess I'm here because I really want somebody to stop me because I just can't do it.
