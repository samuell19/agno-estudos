Today, we honor the memory of Admiral John Harrington. This monument we dedicate is a thing of stone. Which can but suggest the work accomplished by a great American. Yesterday.. ...the Navy had no wings.. ...but Admiral Harrington was leading a small group of determined men in a dangerous and thankless campaign to prove that the aeroplane was destined to be an important part of the fleet. To make this possible Admiral Harrington and others sacrificed their lives. But the job isn't finished. For today...in peace time men are still giving up their lives to maintain and improve our greatest safeguard against war. A powerful navy equipped with an invincible Air Force. Therefore, it is not only to Admiral Harrington but to the men of United States Naval Aviation to those who fly today and to those who will ride the navy wings of tomorrow that we dedicate this monument. - Thank you, sir. - I greatly admired your father. Oh, admiral, I don't believe you've met my younger brother, Jerry. - No. - How do you do, sir? Follow your father's footsteps, eh? - I hope so. - Congratulations. Thank you. You know, it's a shame a man has to be long gone before they start praising him. He's not gone. You know, he had a peculiar belief in immortality, Jerry. He believed that so long as there was a Harrington in the navy, he'd be part of it. Say, could we get a picture of Lt. Harrington? - Go ahead. - Hey, young man. Would you step aside? We want a picture of Lt. Harrington. His name's Harrington too, he's my brother. Yeah, but he ain't news. - What does he do? - Submarine service. Oh. So the hawk has a turtle for a kid brother, huh? Say, I understand you've designed a new fighting plane. Could you tell us about it? No, it's far enough along yet. All set. Thanks a lot. You design a new submarine, son and you'll get your picture in the paper too. Thanks. Well, I guess, that puts me in my place. And see that you stay there. I have a conference over with the Navy Department about the new plane. See you at the hotel later, huh? Good luck and don't let the Navy Department know I'm your kid brother, they'll throw you out. Come in. - Hi, Cass. - Oh, hello, Jerry. Meet Harry White. He's an instructor with me down in Pensacola. - Glad to know you. - How are you? Say, Cass, how do you go about getting a transfer from Submarines to Aviation? - You don't. - But it can be done, can't it? What's the matter? You got that flying bug again? I get it every time I see you in the air. I'd like to trade this sub insignia for wings. - Well, forget it. - Well, why should I forget it? Because you're not the type to make a good navy flyer. Well, what kind of a man is the type? What does he gotta have? Feathers? You're not going to do any transferring and I don't want to hear any more about it. Alright, papa, alright. He's a cross between a mother hen and a maiden aunt. Did it ever occur to you, Cass, I might grow up someday? - No. - Well, you might be surprised. So long, I'll see you down in the field. - So long. - So long. This is the first time I ever heard you try to unsell anybody on flying, what's the angle, Cass? Oh, Jerry, he hates the idea of being a kid brother. You know the difference in our ages gave me a head start. And he's always looking for a shortcut to even things up. Pal, when we were kids he'd like to kill himself trying to outclimb me and almost drowned himself trying to outswim me. The same thing when he played football at the Naval Academy. And you're afraid if he comes to Pensacola he'll break his neck trying to outfly you, is that it? Sure, that's right. Say, Cass.. ...he might be good. He is good. The only trouble is when he's competing with me something happens to him. He's a bust. How is he when he is not competing with you? Oh, he's great, that's why I want him to stay in the submarine services where he won't be under my influence. So, listen someday, he'll run up a record that'll make mine look like something that was written on the side of a barn. In other words, he's not entirely hopeless, huh? Ah, no, he's a grand kid. I'd give my right arm for him. While I was doing it, I'd hang my left on his chin too. That can't be Cass, there's a girl with him. Why, it is Cass. - Hello. - Hello, Jerry. Jerry, this is Irene Dale. Irene, this is my kid brother, Jerry. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Bye, darling. - Goodbye, darling. - 'Come on, Cass!' - I'm coming. See you in Pensacola. No, you won't. Did I see him kissing you or was I dreaming? I was kissing him too. You mean to tell me Cass took time enough off from flying to fall in love with you? Why, is it so incredible? For Cass, yes, for anyone else, no. Of course I've only known you a few minutes but if you had a twin sister and there was a moon I'd be asking her to share my entire fortune consisting of three uniforms submarine insignia and a sword. And, uh, all the luxury that goes with an ensign's paycheck. And my twin sister would be flattered, if I had one. - But what about Cass? - Uh, him, he's different. He isn't human, he's just a built-in accessory to an aeroplane. He's got a carburetor for a heart and it pumps blue and gold gasoline. He just can't be in love with you. Well, he acts as if he were. Maybe he's changed a lot since you last saw him. Maybe, but I doubt it. It must be for you. Let's see what this is. If you come to Pensacola, I'll break your neck. Does he mean you or me? He means me. Aeroplanes, lady, aeroplanes. Conductor, there's a maniac back there. Practicing up choking somebody to death. - Be careful. - He's not a nut, lady. He's a student pilot on his way to a Naval Training Station at Pensacola. They all act that way. You know, flying with their hands. - The left wing's down. - It's a snap roll. Looks more like a flip and turn to me. Snap roll.. - You a flyer? - It's just a question of time. You're on your way to Pensacola? Yeah, you bet. Come on, sit down. I'm Scat Allen. My name's Dan Morrison from Stanford. - Where are you from? - I, well, Agricultural College. Oh, it's a pretty long hop from farming to flying, isn't it? Oh, not very. I'm the soul owner and operator of the Scat Allen Aerial Crop Spraying and Pest Control Corporation. - Incorporated. - Oh, I see. So, you mean, you zoom potato bugs and dive-bomb cutworms, huh? - That's right. - Well, why did you give it up? A farmer said, I did more damage than the bugs. When I get back from Pensacola, I'll be alright. I'll do better business, and that's why I'm going. You fellas going to the flying school too? Another recruit, huh? We're aviation cadets too. Yeah? W-well, my name's Ted Parsons. Well, wait a minute, I've heard of you. Weren't you in All-American half-back last year? Well, I played little football, but, uh.. Well, by the time you get through Pensacola football will seem like a kids game to you. If you get through Pensacola. If? Why shouldn't I get through? When I was a kid on the farm, I asked my father "Why shouldn't I be able to ride that stallion?" See that scar? Boy, no aeroplanes gonna throw me. No, flying's no more complicated than driving a Flivver. Did you ever try to do a flip or turn in the Flivver? I beg your pardon, senores, but I could not help overhear you talk of flying. Don't tell me you're going to Pensacola too. That is my great good fortune. Say, you've got kind of a strange accent. You're from Brooklyn? My name is Armando Costa Lieutenant de Cordoba. From the Brazilian Navy. Your government was kind enough to accept me as a courtesy student. Brazilian Navy? You're a long way from home, aren't you? With the advancement of aviation, Brazil is practically in your backyard. It's fine. I'll tell you. You tie up all your crocodiles and I'll fly down and we'll have a cup of coffee one of these days. Si, senor. Hey, wait a minute! Look at that guy up there. Hey, buddy! Do you know where the cadet barracks are? - In that building. - Thanks. Let me give you a tip, mister. These two stripes I'm wearing signify that I'm a lieutenant. USN. Now, you positively never say, "Hey, buddy" to a lieutenant? Lieutenant junior grade or even an ensign. You salute and say, yes, sir or no, sir. It's little hard to get on to at first. The lieutenant says, yes, sir, to the commander the commander says, yes, sir, to the captain and the captain says, yes, sir, to the admiral. And the admiral says, yes, sir, to the President. Who does the President say, yes, sir, to? Well, the President says, yes, sir, to you. Well, that brings us right back to where we started from. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. And above all, gentlemen, learn to shun this. But by all means, learn to cherish, earn and deserve this. Your lives here at Pensacola will be regulated more but these two signs than anything else. When your check pilot gives you this.. ...you've done a good job. When you start collecting these.. ...you're on your way out. Now, you'll each receive a regulation book. You'll be required to observed every one of these rules. Must understand that they're formulated for your own good and the good of the navy. Their purposes is to turn out the finest flying personnel in the world. Now, is there anything else I can explain? Yes, sir. When do we fly? - Eventually. - Not until then? There's such a thing as overdoing things, mister. Take a deep breath. I wanted a deep breath, not a hurricane. Am I alright? I think so. When do I fly? Oh, one of these days. What I wanna know is when are we gonna fly? Hey, Parsons. What's the idea? Oh, I'm, uh.. I'm going home. What's the matter? They, uh, heard a murmur in my heart. - Was it bad? - No. I can play football, I can run the 440. I can play basketball, but.. I guess I'm just not in good enough shape to be a naval aviator. Busted out before I even get in an aeroplane. That's tough luck, fella. Yeah. Wonder what the psychology examination's like. Search me. Suppose you were leading a company of infantry men and a battleship came towards you from out of the woods. What would you do? I guess I change my brand of liquor, sir. I think you'll do. When do I fly? As soon as you sprout wings. You may go. There's a very silly man in there. Halt. Keep your eyes on the ground and your mind on your business and there might come a day when you'll be in one of those planes up there. Yes, sir. Well, I had to do an awful lot of walking to become a naval aviator. Company, forward. Hut! One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. So, Henry, you have a good trip? Smooth as glass, all the way from San Diego. Ah. What's that? Oh, he's a passenger they sent out with me. - Oh, air sick, huh? - Ever since we took off. Jerry, what are you doing here? I'm gonna be an aviator. So, you wanted to be a navy flyer, huh? They're still laughing at the Officers Club. Look at you, I ought to knock your block off. Here, drink that. I don't know how you wranglers happen to being ordered down here but you're going back to your submarines. A fine welcome to Pensacola from my own flesh and blood too. It's alright you'll be proud of me yet. Why don't you quit before you disgrace the name of Harrington? Can't you realize you'll never make a go at things? - I know what I'm doing. - Sure. So do the kid playing with a machine gun. Look, Cass, I'm free, white and 21. I'm gonna stay here whether you like it or not. I'm gonna learn to fly and when I do it I'm gonna fly the pants off of you. Hmm, I'd be all in favor of that, if you wanted to be a good flyer for the navy. But all the interest you is flying to Pensa for me and that's just where you're gonna be a flop. I'm not gonna flop. And if I do, it's my business. Alright, alright, from now on you're on your own. I'm gonna pretend you're not even here. You get in to a jam, you can get out of it yourself. From now on, I'm leaving you strictly alone. - Is that a promise? - Yes, that's a promise. Here, take your medicine. Gentlemen, today you start to learn how to fly. We'll save the yippees for later. First, you'll be introduced to your flight instructors and you'll learn where to get your parachutes and what to do with them. Now, the first thing to bear in mind is that you're not supposed to know anything. I know you've had your preliminary training in land planes. Some of you have done a lot of civilian flying. But you still don't know anything. So, if you wanna get along with us learn to do things the navy way. Now, before you meet your instructors let me give you one bit of advice. The easiest way to get a squabble is to start knowing more than your instructor. Now, remember, this is not a land plane. Pull back on that stick to start your take off. You do this for two reasons. In the first place, you've got to get her up step or she won't take off. In the second place, you have to keep the spray off the propeller. I'll let you in on a little secret. Water is bad for a prop. - Rust, huh? - I don't mean rust. I mean, hitting the water with your prop turning up too fast. It's like hitting a solid object and it's bends the prop. Yes, sir. I'll remember. Now, if you do, you'll be practically the only student whoever did. Alright, get in and get a feel of the ship on your feet and back. This is what we call a Gosport. It's a speaking tube that allows me to talk to you but you can't talk back to me. Well, suppose I wanna ask a question? I know just about all the questions you'll want to ask. And remember this.. I expect you to make mistakes. But don't let me catch you making the same mistake twice. I'm not waving at the angels when I do this. Your right wing's still low. Bring it up. Now your left wing. Now your right wing again. You're tied up in knots. You handle that stick like you were shaking hands with a baby. Don't try to pull it out of its socket. Take a look around you. You're not the only one flying today. That would have been suicide. Try it again. But this time relax. You're as stiff as a rail. Oh, Mr. White? I'm sorry I made such a bad job of it. Oh, what are you sorry about? - You're practically an ace. - What do you mean? Well, you brought me back alive, didn't you? Hey, what's this? What happened to you? I must have done something wrong. My plane sank. - Say, where's Cass? - Changing clothes, I guess. I think he's awfully disappointed in me. You must be pretty good to sink a plane on Lt. Harrington. Good? If I'd had any sense I'd have stayed out there and drowned. When do you get your solo check? Late this afternoon. When's yours? Pretty soon, I guess. You worried? Not about going up, coming down is what worries me. I understand some of the boys get so scared they won't come down. Is that so? Well, how do they get 'em down? Oh, they shoot 'em down. Well, that's a little bit drastic, don't you think? What's the matter with you, Dan? The big boar just give me a down. I'm supposed to see the commandant, but.. It's no use kidding myself. It will be this. That's tough, kid. And I'd promised my girl I'd bring her a pair of gold navy wings for a present. Okay, once around the bay. Make it plenty hot. Mr. Harrington, is it true they shoot you down if you stay up too long? Sure, they do. You don't have to worry. All you gotta do is bring it up, and bring it down. And remember, any landing you can walk away from is a good one. He'll get along alright without you flying the ship. Crash! Number 41 just hit the sea wall. Are you hurt? Sir, I wish to report a crash. Are you hurt? - Nope. - What a pity. Scat, he's been up an hour. He'll run out of gas pretty soon. Oh, my gosh. Where are you going? Back to the fleet. It's just a question of time till I'm busted out, isn't it? I suppose so. Well, why don't you say, I told you so? Yes, I told you so. I told you, you were going to be a flop. But I didn't believe it. I didn't believe a word of it. Oh, darn it, Cass. Why don't you ball me out? What for? You're not going anywhere for a while. Well...why? Because I found out what was the matter with your flying. Your cockpit's been overcrowded. It's built for one, and you've been packing three around them. This egg, your father, and yourself. You've been trying to live up to too many reputations. - Yeah, you see? - Yeah. And I caught on to your part in this little mix-up when I saw you two this morning. Jerry's nerves are tied up into knots because you heckle him into a case of the jitters every time you get near him. Now, why don't you stay away from him and let me do the instructing? - Remember he's my student. - You see? Jimmy Randel's gonna give you another solo check. Now, don't try and be the best flyer out there. Just be a good flyer. Don't try to make perfect turns.. ...make good turns. And don't try to make a perfect landing either. Be content to make a fair-to-middling-sloppy landing. Yes, sir. Now, let's see you get out there and do your stuff. And as for you.. Disappear somewhere, will ya? Here. Well, how was it? At least you followed White's instructions. Was fair to middling, and pretty sloppy. Thanks. I knew you'd get around to telling me how great I am. This is what you get for being last in solo. One! Two! Three! And four! Remember, we're teaching you to stunt, not for the thrill of it but to train you for combat flying. To enable you to handle your ship under all conditions. Now, the first thing to learn is.. Try that loop again. And watch your controls! That step roll was rigged. Try it again and remember if you lose plane speed you spin. Say, I found out what's wrong with the wing setters of my fighter. I'll warn ya, Irene, if you marry Cass there will come a day when you will be suing an aeroplane failing a nation of perfection. There's enough evidence right here for a breach of promise. It's a good thing I was raised in the navy. To think I have to play second fiddle to an overpowered flying machine. Well, pretty soon it's going to be worse. Oh, how could it be, darling? I hardly see you as it is. You're not gonna see me at all for about two weeks. So I've beefed up the center section. I'm taking my designs to Washington. The Navy's asked for my designs and this time the plane's going to be acceptable. Darn that plane. Say, you don't know when you're well off. Cass and his doodlebug may be gone but you'll still have me. - Will I? - Yep. - We'll go dancing every night. - No matinees? We'll play tennis and ride horseback. Oh, have you given up flying? Ah, don't pay any attention to him. And, uh, we'll swim. You're going to make a marvelous brother-in-law, mister. Can you stay away a month, darling? No. Two weeks. That's all you get. In the meantime.. - Let's dance. - Ah, that's better. What's the matter? Gonna have to put you back in the hothouse. This outdoor light's giving you freckles. Really? And me without a mirror. Are there many? Did you ever see a turkey egg? Is it that bad? I like girls with freckles. That covers a lot of territory. Well, I'll narrow the field down a little bit. I like...you and your twin sister. But I've told you and told you I haven't got a twin sister. - Canada gets all the breaks. - What do you mean? Well, think how nice it'd be if there were five of you. My name'd probably be Yvonne. Nope, that'd be your sister's name. I could go for Yvonne in a big way. You think she'd like me? She'd like you a lot, Jerry. Let's swim out to the raft. Still thinking about my freckles? Nope, I was thinking of Yvonne. I think she'd be something pretty near perfect. She wouldn't be as perfect as you'd think, Jerry. She'd be selfish, for one thing. And she'd want so terribly to be happy that she'd make mistakes. And then she wouldn't have the courage to do anything about them. Sometimes she'd feel pretty disgusted with herself. She wouldn't be that way at all, Irene. She'd have a lot of courage. She'd be generous and kind. Just being near her and helping to make her happy would be about the greatest break a fella could have. And having you feel that way, Jerry.. ...would bring her more happiness than she deserved. Fella seems a little out of bounds. Is he? Cass'll be back some time today. I know. We'd better go back. Yes, I suppose so. Hello, you two. Jerry. Well, you must have good news. Good news, I'm loaded with it. Not only is the Navy Department going ahead with my plane but the big board has selected me for promotion to the noble estate of Lieutenant Commander. - Congratulations, Cass. - Thanks. And as for you, kid, you're gonna be Lieutenant Junior Grade one of these days. The big board has selected you too. Oh, that's swell. Swell? Is that all you can say? Well, I'm tickled to death. Then why don't you act like it? What's the matter with you, flathead? You got trouble or something? I'm alright. Say, I know what's the matter with him. You know, the first promotion always affects you like that. Darling, will you drive me to town? There's something I want to say to you that's none of Jerry's business. In fact, I think, we'll let him walk. You know, it might pull him out of his tail flip. Bye. Why aren't you out flying? Oh, I don't feel so good. Well, I saw the doc, he said there was nothing the matter with you. - Did he? - Yes. Looks to me like you're just doggin'. Why don't you snap out of it? - Oh, I'm sick of flying. - You're what? I'm sick of flying! You're not sick of flying, you're sick in your head. 'Now you've got something awfully important' 'on your mind, so what is it?' Listen, Cass, there are some things in my life that don't concern you. Well, romance is wonderful, isn't it? Aah, what are you talking about? I know all the symptoms. Every time you get a case of puppy love you go Shakespeare on me. You're Romeo and she's Juliet. And you end up walkin' down the road with a gate under your arm sighing like a furnace. Who's the girl? None of your.. There isn't any girl. Now let's see, there was that redhead but you didn't seem to like her. And there was Captain Smith's daughter-- Will ya cut it out? Then there was that Spencer girl but she married that marine. Ah, let's see now. I've been gone about two weeks. Hey. Couldn't be Irene, could it? You're crazy! Don't try to kid me, look at your face. I leave you two weeks alone with Irene and you wind up with a violent case of unrequited love. I am not in love with Irene. If you wanna think that of me, go ahead. Think I'm any kind of double-crosser you want to. Don't be so dramatic, nobody's accusing you. After all, people don't fall in love deliberately it just happens. Anyway, why shouldn't you fall for Irene? Everybody does. That's why I fell in love with her. The only startling thing is why she fell in love with me. Alright, Irene's in love with you, and you're in love with her and I'm not in love with anybody so shut up and go away, will ya? Now that I know what's wrong with you, I know the cure. Will ya please go away? What you need some altitude and some headwind to wipe the bugs out of that conk of yours. Come on! Hey! Say! Come on. Now you know precisely what you're expected to do. So I'm not going to say a word to you unless you start going haywire. As long as I'm silent you'll know you're doing alright. If you head for trouble I'll pull you out of it. Message for you, lieutenant. You wanna wait? Okay! What happened, sir? Harrington's up there, flying blind and he doesn't know I'm not with him. You mean there isn't anybody to help him out if he gets in a jam up there? Good luck, good luck, good luck. Good luck! Gosh! I'm upside down! What's wrong, Cass? Jerry left his instructor on the beach. He's up there flying blind, alone. Well, here we are, sir. Was as simple as falling off of a log. Watch arms beyond. That's his last down. Too bad, he was a good kid. That's why I hated to give him a down. You like me to give him another check? That might be a good idea. Maybe I've got the end-in sign on. Alright, I'll do it some time this morning. - Thanks, Cass. - Well, don't thank me. After all, you yanked Jerry out of his slump. Now if I can save a student for you we're still not even. That reminds me. I had a date. Sorry, Irene, I can't make it. So I'll have to cancel that tennis date. I have to give a cadet a special check flight. You see, I'm trying to save him from being busted out. - Oh, Cass, I'm sorry. - Yes. Why don't you take up Jerry? Oh, on second thoughts, I guess you better not. You see, uh, Jerry's going through an acute phase of growing pains known as puppy love. Yeah. So I guess you better not see him till it gets over. Well, what have I got to do with it? You're the one he's in love with. Did he say that? No, but you should have seen his face when I accused him of it. Don't worry about it, dear, he'll get over it in a week. He always does. In the meantime why don't you run along and amuse yourself? I'll try to get together with you tonight, huh? Goodbye. - Hello, Jerry. - Hello, Irene. I thought you were to play tennis with Cass. I was, he's busy. Oh. I haven't seen much of Cass since he's been back. Well, he's got a lot of work to do. Just as well.. I've had time to think things over. And I've had time to realize that.. I was about to make a mistake that would have hurt him as well as me. What do you mean? I'm going to tell Cass I can't marry him. - Have you been quarreling? - No. He's been just as sweet as ever to me. And that's what's gonna make it difficult for me to tell him. Then don't tell him, Irene. Think it over. I have been thinking it over. Cass was gone two weeks and he's been back three days. And during that time I've.. I've come to realize I'm not in love with him. But Cass is crazy about you, Irene. You can't do this to him, it'll break his heart. Would it be fair to marry him, feeling the way I do? But you'll change your mind again. Why, Cass is the finest fellow in the world. He's the squarest, the most honest and kind. And he's one of the greatest-- He's all of that, Jerry. And his greatness is what attracted me to him. But you were right and I was wrong when I thought that it was love. I can't marry him. What changed your mind? I've fallen in love with someone else. But you can't know anyone that'll make you happier than Cass, Irene. Let's stop deceiving each other, Jerry. You know how I feel. And I know how you feel. Neither of us wanted it that way. We've both been fighting against it. But sometimes things happen to people that they can't help. That they don't want to have happened. And it happened to us. Aren't you gonna let me keep some shred of dignity, Jerry? Are you gonna make me tell you I love you before you say anything to me? We can't talk about it, Irene. We can't even think about it. I know how you hate to hurt Cass, Jerry. And I love you for your loyalty. But it can't change things between Cass and me. You figure things out for yourself. No matter what you decide.. ...I'm gonna try to live up to.. ...to whatever code of ethics I have. Tommy. Is Cass around? Hello, Irene. Cass is up there with a student. If anybody can take the kinks out of him, Cass is the man. Yes, I guess so. Take it easy, kid. Just neutralize your rudder bar and bring your stick forward just past neutral. Pull her out of it, Cass. Pull her out of it! Now let me have the stick. Just sit back and relax. That's a nasty one. - Take this! - No, I won't. What's the matter with this hospital, haven't they discovered by now that you can't cure broken bones with medicine? It's for your nerves, and I'm getting tired of arguing with you about it, you big baby! Alright, alright, then, go away, go away with that thing-- Thanks. Listen, when I get up I'll break your neck. If you get up. - How'd you find out? - Find out what? About my not getting up. I didn't find it out. And it's not true, Cass. Well, the doc was here this morning with four specialists. They all voted the same ticket. I'm grounded for good. Ah, the woods are full of specialists. They can be mistaken, same as anybody else. I don't care what they say, you'll be as good as new. You're in better shape than Ormsby and he's up and around already. Listen, you're neither a doctor nor a fortune-teller. Why do you say silly things like that? Not giving up on you, Cass. No, I'm just looking facts in the face. I'm not looking for sympathy, either. - I'm sorry. - Oh, I'm sorry too. Sure. Well...looks like you'll be carrying the ball from now on. Oh, that won't be so bad. You and dad ran up a pretty good score. All I've gotta do is follow the interference. Yeah, but I want you to show them the way. I want you to be the best fighting pilot in the Navy. I'm going in for big boats. - I said fighting planes! - Big boats. Oh, an aerial truck driver on an ice wagon. That's what you'll be. A big boat isn't an ice wagon. And it takes a darn sight better man to fly one than it does to herd one of your fighting doodlebugs. If you weren't young and stupid, I'd argue with you. Yeah? And if you weren't old and flipped it'd be I'd argue back. Oh, big boats have a crew like a submarine. When you're in a fighting plane you're on your own. You're as close as you'll ever come to having your wings. You got the wind in your face, you're part of the ship and it's part of you. That motor, it's a living thing and it obeys you. Nothing over your head but the sky and you can reach up and touch it. When you're happy you can.. ...you can play like a kid on a blue lawn. You zoom, dive and loop! And you chase clouds like a cat after a ball of yarn. And.. Oh, what's the use? Wasting my breath. You don't even know what I'm talking about. Yes, I do, Cass, I understand. But.. - What is it? - Throw this guy out. He annoys me. How is he, Jerry? They don't think Cass'll ever walk again. Oh. Means he'll have to quit the navy. And you know what the service means to him. Yes, I know. He's lost all that now. All he's got to hang on to is.. Well, all he's got left.. I understand. - Good girl, Irene. - And you? Well, I got a lot of flying to do. Good boy, Jerry. Graduating class all present, sir. Graduating class all present, sir. Take your post. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. Mr. Harrington, you're the third of your name to wear navy wings. I hope you wear them with as much distinction as those who went before you. - Thank you, sir. - Good luck. Class dismissed! Well, how's it feel? I've been looking forward to it so long now it's happened, I can't believe it. I was never so surprised in my life. Right up to the very last minute I expected somebody to come running towards me with his thumb hanging down like a banana. Ha ha. Well, you've earned your wings. I'm kinda proud of you. You gave me my wings, Mr. Harrington. Every time I get into a ship you'll be in the air with me. I'll be Cass Harrington flying the plane. You gave wings to a lot of others. As long as one of us can handle a stick you'll never be grounded. Oh, what are you guys hanging around here for? You've got your wings, haven't you? Well, get out and celebrate before they find out their mistake and take them away from you. This is your day to howl, so go on out and howl. Goodbye, Senor Harrington. And thank you. It is my fondest hope that I may serve my country as gallantly as you have yours, sir. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Thanks. I suppose you'll be going back to the fleet now. Yes, I will. Goodbye, and good luck. Goodbye, Irene. And...thanks. Goodbye, Jerry. Goodbye. Look at that big roof. Boy, if I owned a plane like that I could spray all the boll weevils in the state of Texas. This one's gonna be my personal property. I'm gonna rent a room and sleep there. When she goes to Honolulu, I'm gonna be at the yoke. There's a lot of crackerjack big boat pilots that won't get a chance at that hop. So if you boys get to Honolulu in the next few months it'll be in a battle wagon. Does anyone issue orders against trying? No, and I'm all for you. But I'll bet you ten to one you'll be on the ground waving at the flight when it leaves for Honolulu. I can get better odds than that right around the corner. - Are you Mr. Parsons? - That's right. We were ordered to report to you for big boat instruction. Alright, you've got lot to learn. Get aboard and get in your flight jackets. Come on, let's get at it. - Morning, sir. - Morning! Fix them up with flight gear. When you get set, come forward. - Good morning. - Morning, sir. - How's everything? - Fine, sir. Come on! It's okay. This is Smitty, the best plane captain on the fleet. - Harrington, Allen. - Hello. - Hi. - How do you do? Tad, let Harrington have your seat. Aye aye, sir. Lock your safety belt. Tower, what's your oil temperature? Sixty-five degrees, sir. Go. Tower, are we ready to take off? Aye aye, sir. I'm adjusting the tab. Keep the manifold pressure above 30. Watch those floats go up. Put her in cruising combination. Before we come back you'll see how one of these big boats will defend itself against an attack by smaller planes. I didn't believe anything this big could fly. The only difference between this and a submarine is this has got wings. Do you wanna take over for a while? - How does she feel? - Smooth as silk. Here comes the attack. Better let me take over. Put her in maneuvering combination. Take your battle stations. They'll attack. ...blast the targets it means we do the same thing to enemy ships. Got that one. Got that baby too. Go back to cruising combination. Oh, she's a honey. A baby! How lovely she is. Well, these things get you, don't they? Well, I'll see you later. I'm gonna take care of my baby. So long. Well, if the cavalry ever gets in a jam this ought to carry a great big load of hay. Is that so? Why, Cass! When did you get in? About an hour or so ago. - How's the boy? - Oh, he couldn't be better. Say, it's well to see, but why didn't you let me know you were coming? Oh, I figured you'd find out when I got here. - So you're flying that, huh? - Yep. Ain't she beautiful? If she could only cook. Hmm, wait'll they accept my ship. Fly the wings off of this thing. Alright, I won't quarrel with you. I'm too glad to see you looking so well. Didn't I tell you'd be as good as new? Hmm, fine, tell the navy examining board that. Every time I try to convince them I'm fit for service they give me that. Well, there's other things besides the navy. - How's Irene? - Oh, she's fine. Say, if it weren't for that girl they'd have sewed me up in canvas long ago. - Where is she? - She's here. Gonna stay with some relatives until they test my ship. Oh, that's well. When I get that off my chest we're going to get married. She's awfully anxious to see you. Why don't you come over and say hello? Well, I've got to stay around here. - I've got some things to do. - Okay. Well, we'll see you this evening then, huh? Fine. Hello, Cass. It's Captain March. - Bureau of Aeronautics. - Glad to know you, sir. I hope your plane comes through. The navy could use a ship like that. Well, it's passed everything but the terminal velocity test. And if it is passes that today the Navy Department will owe you a lot of thanks. Well, having the navy accept it is all the thanks I need. Excuse me, sir. Here's our test drive. Hello, Steve. - All set? - All set. - How do you feel? - Fine. Well, she's in a perfect shape. Take her up to 15,000 feet. Then take it down to 10,000 and pull her out. Try to shove that accelerometer reading right off the dial. - I'll try. - Give it a work. Try to tear the wings off of your cap. I don't think you can, but try anyway. - Okay. - And listen. If you find she won't take it for heaven's sake bail out in time. I'll try and get her down all in one piece. But if I get in a jam, don't worry about me bailing out. Okay, good luck. Jump, Steve, jump! I wouldn't take it too hard, Cass. How else would I take it? Well, you've got another plane ready for testing. And I suppose there's another test pilot somewhere like Steve who's ready to die, in a coffin. Designed by Cass Harrington. Well, how do you know it was the plane that failed? Maybe it was Steve. It ought to be a breeze to take it through those tests. I could do it myself. Oh, you could? Have you any idea what happens to a test pilot when he makes a terminal velocity dive? - I think I have. - No, you haven't! You have to take a cranky unknown experimental plane up to 15,000 feet. Open the throttle and shoot yourself to Earth like a cannon ball. The wind is like a thousand knives ready to rip and tear out your wing fabric. You're going between three and four hundred miles an hour straight down. And when you pull back on the stick believe me, you'll pray. The air has suddenly become a brick wall and if the seat isn't stressed for 2000 pounds you'll bust right through the plane. And in seconds your plane and your body are shooting upward. Everything inside of you keeps on falling. Every organ in your body is out to be ripped out of place. Your blood drains, everything goes black. You can't see, you can't breathe and you're knocked out cold! If you're lucky, you come to before your crash. And then you're liable to find yourself in a death trap. You try to jump, but it's too late. Something like that happened to Steve today. You think that's the kind of a job for a kid like you? Oh, I suppose not. But even a kid can have faith in what his big brother is trying to do. Am I out of place, Cass? Oh, of course not. You're not out of place. Sorry. Yes, sir. I don't suppose it will come as a complete surprise if I tell you that we're planning a mass flight of big boats to Honolulu. That's all we've been talking about, sir. There's been some shifting of flight personnel and three commands are vacant. As you three have been selected for promotion you're to be made lieutenants. Junior grade and assigned to the Honolulu flight. I congratulate you. You mean, we're really going along, sir? Right. Please, uh, I can understand your exuberance but let's not convey the impression that someone is being assassinated in here. Here, put these in water, will you? - Hello, Irene. Where's Cass? - I don't know, Jerry. Maybe he's heard the news, and he's avoiding me. What news? Well, with me, Irene, you behold a person of vast importance. A man of consequence. In other words, a navy hotshot. Would you mind telling me what you're driving at? From now on I'm a lieutenant, junior grade. - How marvelous. - And that's not all. I've been given command of a big boat and I'm gonna take part in a mass flight from here to Honolulu. - Congratulations, Jerry. - Thanks. Wait till Cass hears about this. Will he be chagrined. He said I'd never make it. After I rub it in for a while, we'll celebrate. - What's the matter, Irene? - Nothing. Only, I wouldn't plan on rubbing it in on Cass, Jerry. I wouldn't plan on celebrating either. You don't think I'd mean it, do you? I know you'd just be kidding, Jerry. But you know, Cass has changed a lot recently. He's abnormally sensitive, and he broods a lot and whenever I try to cheer him up he just gets irritable. It's that plane of his, I suppose. It looks as if it's going to be abandoned. And if it is, Cass will lose everything he wants out of life. Well, the plane's not that important to Cass, Irene. He'll get over it, and he'll have a lot left to live for too. - He'll have you, Irene. - Yes, he'll have me. But that's not enough, Jerry. Can't you understand that? No, I can't. I know. I didn't at first. I made a bargain. I accepted a job and I thought that by merely accepting it, I had accomplished it. Jerry, I did everything I could to make Cass happy. But in spite of it I've realized that nothing is as important to Cass as a few yards of canvas and steel tubing and a motor. That's not true, Irene. - Cass loves you. - Let's face facts, Jerry. Cass has never reconciled himself to being out of the navy. He feels he's only half a man, that he's a failure. That plane is asymbolto him. If he can keep the navy's colors on its wings, he'll feel he's back in service again. He won't mind being crippled. He'll be happy again. And if the plane's a failure.. ...Cass will die. Slowly inside. And there's nothing I can do about it. Can't you see that, Jerry? Yes, I can now. You know, Irene.. ...a long time ago I gave up something I wanted very much. And ever since then I've been so busy feeling sorry for myself that I never stopped to consider that there might be two sides to that part. I can't begin to match what you've done, Irene. But the least I can do is try. If there's any way in the world of keeping navy colors on Cass' plane I'm going to do it. How, Jerry? I don't know. Hurry up there. She goes up in 20 minutes. It'll be ready. I wouldn't test that overpowered crank for all dough in the world. - Oh, that pilot must be crazy. - Yeah. You gonna look awfully silly with all off this junk on. Why don't you let the doc put it on me? You go get your resignation back. I told you, Scat, that's out. Look, Jerry, I'm gonna be out of the navy soon. Why should you give up your whole career? Let me resign and test Cass' plane. He gave me my wings, didn't he? When a cadet gets out of the navy, he gets a $1500 bonus. $1500. You'll need that for spraying equipment. There are a lot of potato bugs in Iowa waiting for you to zoom. If you let me help Cass, the potato bugs can have Iowa. This is strictly a family affair. Draw in your breath. - What's that for? - Keep your kidneys in place. Draw in your stomach, I want this good and tight. What's that for? Keep your liver intact. Better than having your insides fall out, isn't it? Put on your shirt. Put this over your flying suit. It'll help. Pretty good idea to yell as hard as you can just before you pull out of your dive. Yell? It'll tighten the throat and stomach muscles and keep the arteries from puffing up. When the time comes pull this as tight as you can. It'll keep the blood from draining out of the head. There's nothing in his head, or he'd let me make the flight. Now you better wait here, dear. Alright. Where's the test pilot? There's the guy. - Jerry. - Hi, Cass. What're you doing in that outfit? Test pilots have to dress like this. It's a union rule. You're not gonna take that plane up. - Why not? - Because you can't. It's against regulations to test planes. You'd be thrown out of the navy. Well, I'm not in the navy anymore. - What? - I resigned my commission. You're, you're not a.. Well, I won't let you do it. It's already done. Listen, you don't know what you're up against. - You haven't enough exp-- - Yeah, I know, papa. Now run along and mind your own business, will you? You get that junk off. You're not going to take that ship up. Listen, Cass, for a long time I've been trying to prove to you that I'm a better flyer than you are even in your best days. Today I'm going to and in your plane too. Kill that motor. Cass, I'm gonna fly that plane if I have to knock you cold to do it. Now listen, that plane isn't going up today, that.. - Take care of him. - Take your hands off me. I don't want to do this, Cass. But I gotta, I gotta do it, Cass. Hurry up, get in the plane and get going. Jerry! Jerry! - Let her go. - Take it easy, Cass. When he comes down, I'll let you sock me an hour for this. Oh, Cass, if anything happens to Jerry.. I hope it works this time. Good luck, good luck, good luck. Good luck, good luck, good luck. Ouch. Look at that thing climb. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck, Jerry. Please! Please! - Good boy, Cass. - Congratulations, Cass. - Congratulations. - You alright, Jerry? Take it easy, my boy. There you are. Jerry, you did it. You gave my ship to the navy. Well done, Jerry. Well done. You see, the kid loves this service as much as any man ever did. That Honolulu flight meant everything in the world to him. And he gave it all up for me. Please, sir, cancel that resignation. If not for my sake, well, then for the sake of the old man. You see, if he were alive it would awfully important to him to have at least one Harrington in the navy. I'm washed up. Jerry is the only one left to carry on. You must do something, sir. Attention. Alright, carry on, as you were. Now you've all read the Honolulu flight audits but just to make certain there'll be no mix up I wanna stress these points. First, don't shift your carburetor settings under any circumstance without notifying me and getting permission. Second, there'll be no gabbing over the radio phones. Report your fuel consumption according to schedule. Otherwise, leave the air clear of chatter. Now, I have an appointment for the... high balls at the Officers Club in Honolulu in just 20 hours. And I don't want to be late. Let's get going. I don't see him. You don't suppose they've decided not to.. There he is. Jerry. Well, I hate to admit it, kid, but I'm kinda proud of you. Thanks, Cass. I waited a long time to hear you say that. Well, I've said it. Now don't make me change my mind. And remember, only one Irishman got away with flying backwards. So don't you try to land in Cuba. Well, I've checked my compass. It'll be Honolulu or nothing. Well, it better be. Oh, uh, that reminds me, there's something I.. - Well, I thought.. - What is it, Cass? Oh, nothing, just remember, the water's soft unless you hit it hard. So don't get wet. I'll try not to. We better be going. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Scat. Oh, oh, Scat, just a minute. I want you to do something for me. Yes, sir. I'm afraid I'm getting old and sentimental. Anyway, when you get into the air I wish you'd ask Jerry to wear these. Yes, sir. See, I wore those for a long time. Before that, my father had them. Not quite as new as Jerry's but.. ...I think he'd like to wear them. I'm sure he would, sir. Good luck. Goodbye, Irene. Goodbye, Jerry. Lots of happiness. Thanks. Good luck, Jerry. Plenty of visibility. Thanks. Carl, ready for take off? Aye aye, sir. And let her go. There's a clipper ship taking off to Honolulu tomorrow. You'll be on it. - I? - Yes, you. Now that I'm cured, I'm firing the nurse. That's gratitude for you. - Cass. - Now, now, now.. We're not going to have any arguments about it. Oh, Irene. It's something I should've had sense enough to see long ago. Oh, and please don't think that I'm hurt or angry or.. Or that I feel cheated. Having known you for a little while will give me more happiness than I've ever deserved.
