Don't worry, Mayorov, we'll pass the exam. Listen to me, it's all right. We'll go soon, I just have to take this home. OK, see you! Hey miss, you dropped an apple. By the way, in this kind of situation Cervantes would say nothing costs so little and is so appreciated as politeness. You're not very talkative. Your face seems familiar to me... Excuse me, where might I have seen you before? Don't you remember me? Miss. Miss, I have a friend, he's an actor. Often someone stops him on the street to ask where they've seen him. Are you an actress? Silence is a sign of agreement. You're an actress, you do radio work, and you don't speak unless paid to. You've already bought some fruit. College of Circus Arts He says with the hair up isn't funny, and I say "Yes, it is." I'm going to make everyone laugh at every circus with this gag. Am I right? You sure are! Yeah, it's always funny. Don't worry, it'll be fine. It's for the least talkative girl. - What are you doing here? - Waiting. For who? Oh, let me have a look. - Bravissimo! - That's how it is, my friend. Bye! Theater of Mime and Gesture Cigarette, please! The lighting isn't quite right. Tybalt's in the dark. Move it a little to the right. Gentlemen, dinner is served. Come on guys, let's drink some tea and eat. - How's it going? - 120 more pages. Eat something. So what about that girl? Which one? The one from the photo. - All right. - Yeah? Good. She have a pretty girl friend, like her? One I could get acquianted with? When's your next date? Tonight, midnight. Where? On the roof of the planetarium. Be careful! - When's the next rehearsal? - Six. Hurry up, boys! Hey, kid, where does Natasha Svetlova live? You mean this one? ROMEO & JULIET Thank you, I'll stand. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet. Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself. I take thee at thy word: Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; Henceforth I never will be Romeo. My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: Art thou not Romeo and a Montague? Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; And what love can do that dares love attempt By whose direction found'st thou out this place? By love, who first did prompt me to inquire; Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek My name is Sergei. Natasha. I can hear nothing at all. - Who are you? - A student at the conservatory. Until I was three I could hear. I only recall the sound of bombs, and of the wind. I used to recall a lullaby, too. Yes, we've certainly met before. Only I don't remember where. Miss, say just one word to me. Just your names, girls! We'll wait for you over here. You can speak to me. I can read lips. Do you love the circus? Do you love your music? What does your music sound like? It's like the sound of wind... or of a lullaby. I don't know. I saw that while you practiced you moved to the music. You have a very good sense of rhythm. Do you love Beethoven? He was deaf. What instrument do you play? Oboe. Do you perform? I play in a student chamber orchestra. We have a concert day after tomorrow. You're welcome to attend. Understand? Very well, let's continue. It's a waste of time. Nothing good will come of it. It's all right. We'll try again. She'll find her rhythm. I'm asking you. Please. I can do it! Two coffees, please. And cake. Good evening. Good evening. I'll sit here. Thank you very much. Too bad you missed the hockey game. Our team won, 4-1. Were you there? - Meet Natasha. - Nice to meet you. Dima. Do you like it here? - She does. - Too bad you missed the game. It was a stunner! An amazing thing to see. I can't even describe it. The game starts... After the first period, score is 0-0. Second period, 1-1. With eight broken sticks! Can you imagine it? Third period... Natasha, do you like hockey? - How'd Mayorov do? - Terrific! They all did great! Would you like to dance? Dima, the waitress is asking about you. They said you swiped a vase. Me? A vase? - Really? - Seriously. Excuse me, please. There's been some misunderstanding. Tired? Will you accompany me home? Come with you? THE END
