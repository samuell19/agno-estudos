Make Athena your goddess and love. We have heard the arguments, and we have established the facts. We now all await the resolved voice of this court. The Elgin Marbles are in the lawful and rightful possession of the British Museum. I am here today on behalf of the people of Greece and on behalf of the woman I love. And I beseech you all of a serious crime. So, is it good? You recall the Hunt Letter. The first line of the second paragraph states in Italian, and I quote: "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N. N." It is undated and does not bear a signet. Now look what I've just discovered. This is the Ottoman letter that was translated from Italian into Turkish to be approved by the Grand Vizier himself. It was long thought to have disappeared... until now. Look here-- at the bottom it is signed by a wax signet confirmed to be by Seged Abdullah and is dated July 9, 1801. But more importantly, it identifies the courier as Mehmed Rashid Aga. Take a look at this copy of the letter that Reverend Hunt submitted to Parliament in 1816. This is the solitary proof that the British Museum has used to maintain possession of the Parthenon Marbles for the last 200 years. The first line of the second paragraph reads, and I quote: "We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English gentlemen, secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador, Lord Elgin." "Move your hand... and Athena will help you." This is a forgery. I knew it all had to be a lie right from the beginning. With these three documents, we can prove the Parthenon Marbles were stolen and illegally traded artifacts and currently remain as falsely possessed property within the British Museum. Bull Leaper... You have the scent of blood in your nostrils. Have you briefed Eleni on all of this yet? I'm meeting her right after this. It's getting worse out there. Every day now it seems to be getting worse. Andreas, I brought you in because of your reputation for results, and so far you have given me some reason to hope again. But as chaos breaks upon the foot of my temple of ethos, I also have reason to hesitate. I can win this. That's your problem, my friend. Justice is what the people want, and it is what I want. Remember how it used to be? Not really. I don't know what brought me back here. May you have eyes in the back of your head. So it's fallen to us. I'd say its about time that someone took a stand for true justice. May you have eyes in the back of your head. If we're not careful, the British will chop us up and put us on display in the Duveen Gallery. You look better in one piece. Athens is a place of tumult and uncertainty. It is rife with corruption and anarchy. We cannot allow these priceless treasures of history to fall into the wrong hands at a time like this. The people of Athena used to be able to look up at their Acropolis, the safe haven high above the city, and know that a sacred force protected them and inspired them to serve a higher cause than their base inclinations... in the temple of virgin truth. It was Shelley who said that we are all Greeks now. Let us do what we can to honor that sentiment today. We owe the fundamentals of our culture to the ancient Athenians. Their legacy is just as much ours today as it is even to the current inhabitants of Athens. Even though they seem to dishonor the hallowed city by covering it with graffiti and garbage. That cherished legacy should not be taken away from an institution that can carry it forward. The Grecian columns that hold up this very building symbolize the structural fortitude required to uphold international justice. And yet the people of Hellas are today discriminated as the lower class of Europe. This may be intentional or it may be unconscious, but either way the effect is destructive. To this day, even the name "Elgin Marbles" obscures the Marbles' history, and the disordered arrangement in which the Marbles are displayed betrays the ignorance to the story that is told in the stone. I am an island. With your voices resolve this. Ensure that the fate of the Marbles is certain, that they remain on display so that our children may stand before them that they may forever dream of that elusive ideal. Yes. Okay. This man is not accustomed to asking for help. Thank you for your support. Yes. This bull can find his way through the labyrinth. Consider it done. And despite the current financial crisis and ongoing civil unrest in Athens, the Greek Cultural Ministry and the Acropolis Museum have decided to launch a controversial and sudden litigation effort against the British Museum for the return of the Elgin Marbles. The legal effort is being led by newly appointed - New York Greek American attorney... - No, that won't be necessary. Andreas Orestis... I just made some compelling discoveries myself that will prove to be decisive. ...serving on behalf of the ministry, Eleni Arapkiles. Like I said before, all I can say at this time is that I'm in the process of building the case for the return. On the opposing side, famed defense council Callum Stevenson is representing the BM following his recent victories against the Egyptian... -Thank you. -Turkish, and Syrian governments over art repatriation claims. And a previously unknown Ottoman document has surfaced that is said to delegitimize the BM's claim to the famous sculptures. All rise. Be seated. Your Lordship, I would like to present the court with three incriminating documents that implicate the counter-party and contest the ownership of the so-called Elgin Marbles. Please state your full name for the record. Richard Detweiller. Are you employed by the British Museum? I am. What is your position? Her Majesty's representative, the keeper of the Roman, Egyptian, Asiatic, and Greek antiquities at the British Museum, Great Russell Street, London. And how long have you been so employed? Thirty-nine years. You are familiar, sir, with the sculptures known as the Parthenon Marbles? I am familiar with Lord Elgin's collection, yes. Under what authority does the British Museum retain this collection in perpetuity? If I was to be asked so bluntly, sir, by act of Parliament. By act of Parliament, are you referring to the settling of Elgin's debt by the assembly in 1816? No. I am referring to the bestowal of the antiquities by the British people upon the museum for safekeeping and restoration. So this gives the right of possession? Yes... in perpetuity. Let me ask you this: if someone stole from you and then sold your property to someone else, don't you think that you would have some grounds -to ask for it back? -Such impunity. Answer the question. The Marbles were not stolen, sir. Lord Elgin's collection was lawfully obtained with permission from none other than the highest authority of the Ottoman Empire. Document number one: the Hunt Letter. Can you identify this document? Yes, it's the Hunt Letter. That's right. What does the Hunt Letter state? Uh, the Hunt Letter states the permission granted to Lord Elgin to remove the sculptures from the Acropolis where the Parthenon resides. Can you refer me specifically to the part that says that? Don't be absurd. It's written in Italian. That's right. Then if I may quote a translation from your office, the letter makes a request for permission to "contemplate, mold, and measure" the sculptures. Remove? Yes, but that 's not the only clause in the letter. The following clause is of particular note. Ah. I'm glad that you brought that up, Mr. Detweiller. I'll read it to you. It declares that while they may, quote: "dig the foundations to find inscribed bricks which may have been preserved in the rubbish, when they wish to take away some pieces of stone with old inscriptions and figures that no opposition be made." Now, as an expert in the caring and management of ancient antiquities, could you tell me what "bricks" they were referring to? It's not particularly specific. I think that this document sounds more like a permission letter for sailors on a Grecian holiday, than a license to loot ancient artifacts. Wouldn't you agree? Mr. Orestis, I believe you've made your point. I am neither nautically inclined, nor do I take my holidays in Greece, so I am not qualified to speculate on your ignominious question. Can you tell me when this letter was written? July 1801. How do you know that? Well, it was made as a translation from the Turkish order. What if I were to tell you you're wrong, and that it is not a translation of the Turkish order, but rather the other way around? Then I should think you to be very self-ingratiating. Besides, you have no way of proving your theory. The Greeks callously burned all of the evidence in their revolt of 1821. That's a very convenient story that I'm sure you would like to believe. But I have a surprise for you. Document number two: The Mektub. Name, please. Amit Gabril Agama. What is your position? I am the Custodian of Historical Records of the Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul, Turkey. What do your duties as Custodian of the Records entail? It is my sacred responsibility to categorize, maintain, and safe-keep all decrees and royal mandates of the Imperial House of Osman, specifically pertaining to the reign of Sultan Selim III. And what have you brought with you today? I have brought with me a mektub from a lost collection of documents belonging to the Ottoman governor of Athens. It states the material term of Lord Elgin's wish to contemplate, mold, and measure the sculptures. So you're telling us that this is a mektub? Yes. Can you clarify the difference between a mektub and a firman for us? Yes, certainly. Well, a mektub is an order issued by the Vizier himself, and a firman is, well... a more sacred or holy document. It is what we would call the will of Allah transcribed by the Sultan himself. And as you requested, I have here a firman belonging to the reign of Sultan Selim III. This firman is dated to 1792 and is addressed to the French ambassador. In the beginning, the Sultan starts by calling for Allah for divine inspiration. And onto the lower part of the page, he transcribes and interprets the message. And as you can see, it starts with: "God is Great. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but God. There is only one God and Mohammad is his prophet." And it goes on to say: "I, the righteous, the destined, am instructed by sacred law and commitment to the power I serve, to rain goodness upon my empire. And it is through this duty that I call upon Allah for his wisdom and blessing upon this decree." And then Allah specifically instructs the Sultan to give the French ambassador tax immunity. On the other hand, the Mektub starts with a long diplomatic sentence, which resembles more like a permission letter for a tourist. And it is contextually and grammatically distinct from the more religiously themed firman. Amit, in the first line of the second paragraph of the Mektub, who is identified as the courier? It is Mehmet Rashid Aga. Thank you, Amit. That will be all. Thank you as well. And at this moment, the Republic of Turkey would like to make a formal inquiry as to when the British Museum intends to bring the pieces remaining of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus to its native land. It has been duly noted, Amit. Thank you. Mr. Detweiller, I'm now going to ask you about the second page of the Hunt Letter. On page two, in the first line of the second paragraph, who is identified as the courier? "N. N." Non Nullus. It's Latin for "someone." "Someone"? Why not Mehmet Rashid Aga? I don't know! Maybe that means that the Hunt Letter is not a translation of the permission, but it is rather the first draft. But if that was the case, then what would happen when Hunt returned to England with only this unsigned first draft? What proof would he have for the select committee of Parliament? And document number three: the English Translation. I have here excerpts... from the 1816 select committee hearings that I will submit into evidence. On pages 35 and 142 respectively, Lord Elgin and Reverend Hunt admit they did not have permission to remove the Marbles. They confess that through the explicit use of bribery they obtained the Marbles from Greece. But that leaves us with a problem. Neither Hunt nor Elgin had a copy of any kind of written permission to corroborate their story. All Hunt had was an Italian first draft that he kept in his personal possession. Would you hurry up and come to the point? This is the English translation of Reverend Philip Hunt's letter that he submitted as solitary evidence for the acquisition of ownership of the Marbles of the Parthenon. If you could please direct your attention to the first line of the second paragraph of Hunt's new letter, the so-called "English Translation." Who is indicated as the courier? "Philip Hunt, an English gentleman, secretary to the aforesaid Ambassador, Lord Elgin." I want to ask you honestly, why do you think that the third document, Hunt's English version, indicates that he is the courier at the time and that the verified signet is from Seged Abdullah Kaimacam? I don't believe I have to answer that question. Mr. Detweiller, do I need to remind you that you are here under subpoena -and you must answer me? -Mr. Orestis, -you need to back down from my client. -Isn't it clear that this is a forgery and the Marbles were taken unlawfully -by bribery and deceit? -This is offensive, sir. Can't you admit that? If you do not curtail your brazen behavior this instant, this deposition will be over! Now, do you have any further questions for my client? Just one more for the record. Does the British Museum have any intention of ever returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece with lawful title? No. The only way the marbles will be loaned to Greece is if the Acropolis Museum in Athens agrees that the Marbles are and will always be the property of the British Museum. Monsieur Agrapidakis, could you please share with us your qualifications and describe what you have brought for us today? I have a PhD in Structural Engineering and Classical Architecture from the Sorbonne. And for the past thirteen years, I've overseen the Parthenon reconstruction and preservation program on the Acropolis of Athena. See? I have brought a simulation which will help you see the Parthenon the way I see it. And so the buildings arose, as imposing in their sheer size as they were inimitable in the grace of their outlines. Can you walk us through the taking of each of the sculptural programs by Lord Elgin's men in 1801? The temple's most imposing segments are the two pediments. As the sun rose up in the east, it would have illuminated the immaculate Birth of Athena. The newborn goddess of justice. On the west: The Contest of Athena and Poseidon. Her victory which earned her the namesake of the city. Of the many meanings that the Parthenon conceals, one of the most salient is represented in its outer and inner sculptural programs. Originally on the outer layer of the Parthenon, there were 92 individual blocks of solid marble, each weighing over two tons. The metopes. The metopes depict the struggle between human spirit and animal nature, as represented here by this Lapith man fighting a centaur. In order for Elgin to remove the metopes, sections of the entablature of the building had to be removed by his men and dropped fifteen meters to the ground where they were smashed. And the frieze? This is the inner layer of the temple. One hundred and fifteen blocks of marble at a total length of 160 meters. Here seen as was intended: high off the ground, not on the floor. Its meaning is still somewhat of a mystery, however, it could be the representation of the sacrifice of the daughters of the king Erechtheus. As the story goes, the daughters of Erechtheus willingly gave up their lives in order to save the city. Or... it could be the representation of the first Panathenian procession, depicting the enlightened citizens of Athens honoring their goddess Athena. If I may add, this is exactly why reunifying the marbles would be a tremendous help for people like myself, my colleagues, the global community of archaeologists. It would help us investigate the proper sequence of those slabs and rediscover a knowledge that otherwise would be lost. In any case, the two layers of the temple served as the first line of defense, and the first line of support protecting the sacred chamber within. Michel, in your opinion, did the removal process compromise the temple's structural integrity? The structure of the building was certainly compromised, and the removal of the large cornices above the frieze left the building underneath exposed to more weather erosion. Thank you. One more thing. I have studied the Parthenon for over three decades. We often think of it as merely a building whose value is derived from its aesthetics. But in fact, what marks its significance is not its symmetry or its ideal proportions, but rather the message that was lifted up on high by those marble pillars. In my opinion, the removal of the Parthenon Marbles did incomparably more damage than the explosion that destroyed the inner colonnade. It erased the very thing that the building was built for in the first place. Thank you. Your Lordship, the facts as they have been presented in this court are beyond dispute. Fact number one: The letter of permission is a mektub, and not a firman. Fact number two: The language of the Mektub was abused and in conjunction with the use of bribery facilitated the looting of the Marbles of the Parthenon. Fact number three: The looting of the Marbles left the building structurally compromised. Fact number four: Both Lord Elgin and Reverend Hunt admitted they did not have permission, and that they resorted to the use of bribery to obtain the Marbles. And fact number five, which is the most damning: Reverend Hunt committed forgery when he submitted to Parliament a doctored translation as proof of purchase. It has therefore been made abundantly clear that Parliament's act of 1816 is not valid, that it is derived from an illegitimate authorization from a foreign occupier, claimant to that false right of possession of the property of the people of Athena, and that the British Museum is under no authority whatsoever to maintain possession of the antiquities belonging to Greece and her Hellenic peoples. Case in point: Evidence of perjury, larceny, forgery, and transgression of sovereignty transfers severe liability upon the implicated party who is in willful possession of stolen goods. It is therefore in the best interests of that implicated party to adhere to the rule of law and for this court to exercise jurisprudence. Your Lordship, the prosecution rests. My Lord High Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of Her Majesty's court. This has been a rather interesting and in some ways entertaining historical exercise on behalf of our colleagues from Greece. One might say a longwinded detour into the pages of the past. So for the sake of brevity, the defense would like to make the following concessions: We will concede that the Reverend Philip Hunt did indeed commit forgery in his submission to Parliament, that the Mektub is, of course, not a firman from the Sultan, and that the building was damaged by the removal process. However, thanks to the diligent work of our accusers, we now have the definitive evidence that Lord Elgin and his expedition had the permission to remove whatever they should like from the Acropolis of Ottoman-administered Athens. The defense would therefore like to suggest an immediate motion for dismissal of these charges. Your Lordship, you cannot allow this! You will restrain yourself immediately! - I will not be silenced! - Mr. Orestis-- This court needs to take action now! -By the principle of Chevron Deference-- - You insufferable imperialist! Sir, you will address the members of this court in a manner which reflects the sacred charge which it defends! Sacred charge? Mr. Orestis, if you do not behave yourself instantly, you may be held in contempt! -You have before you definitive proof! -This court will have the prosecution silenced immediately. It is the prerogative of this court to judge whether or not progressive action is appropriate. This matter of stewardship of these sculptures is not fit for this court of justice, but rather is a dispute to be settled between the two museums. This case is dismissed. Andreas! I am a castaway. I am an island. May you have eyes in the back of your head. Andreas! Andreas! Hello, Sophia. Yes, we're fine. I'm fine. Really, it's okay. My apartment is close. Yes, I know. What else? Okay, dearest Sophia, it's okay. Okay, speak tomorrow. All is well. Eleni tells me that the two of you are working together. A lawyer who wants to do some good in this time of crisis? Thank you, Persephone. I'm sorry. The Parthenon Sculptures are not just the most famous artifacts of the classical period. They are its foundation. Those slabs bear the story of the beginning. They speak of a force that compels man out of the darkness and into a new world of philosophy, democracy, and enlightenment. Their ethics are written in stone so that they may outlive mortal men. The people today are scared. We have reverted to a time of primal fear, where animal baseness fosters distrust, greed, and selfish desires. The return of the Marbles is our only chance to remember ourselves. They are a beacon of light in a time of suffocating darkness. Come. I've never seen this side of Greece. This is not Greece. This is something else. These new tankers can move 80 million gallons of oil. The truth, which you fail to understand, is that no ancient stones are going to wake up this generation. The damage that time has done, it's irreparable. It's like a wound that has bled out. A city without a soul is just a mob. That's nice. Let's go. It is not in my nature to be so generous, but I'm willing to consider giving you a position as the lead counsel in this big deal I'm working out with some Russian friends. It's funny. The British made off with the history, the Germans own the banks and the land, and the Russians are going to buy the gas. It seems like all of Greece is for sale. I was about your age when the Junta fled and abandoned us to the Turks. Forced out of our homes, defeated, humiliated. It was then that being Greek no longer meant anything to me. In fact, in the world today, being Greek is being stigmatized. The hardest times are ahead. You should get out while you can. I'm sorry. I don't know if I can help you. I'm the only one who can help you. No, you're not. Get off my boat. A city without a soul is just a mob. How are you, dearest? -Good. -Mama is asleep? -Yes. -Yes. -Would you like some little plums? -Yes. Society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in. You follow in the footsteps of Pericles. Pericles? Do you know before him, the people wanted to leave the Acropolis a ruin, as it was left by the Persians? As some kind of tragic reminder to never again be too proud or too bold. Pericles made the people understand that Athena's true justice needed to be shown before it could be believed in again. A symbol. And there you have your precious Parthenon... today in ruins. I refuse to believe it is all lost. This discussion is over. You haven't considered all of our options. I don't have time for this. There is still a chance for an appeal. Yianni... Yianni, you are being very unreasonable. The world was against you. Did you really expect that any foreign court of law could deliver any kind of justice for us? You need to fight for your own justice. You and I are as responsible for the future of this country as anyone else is. This is our future. What is he doing here? He shouldn't be anywhere right now! I asked him to join us to share his side of the situation... his perspective... before we let the press eat him alive. Thank you. It's too late for that. Look at this headline: "Greedy Greeks Squander Any Hope of Repatriation." As if we all didn't have enough shit to be dealing with! One more thing to fuel the mob. Yianni, the bigger picture... The bigger picture? The bigger picture? Your incompetence? Your lack of judgment? The effect that this disaster of a case is having on our foreign relations, on our economy? The aid that we need to fund our creditors in Germany and the EU? The aid that we depend on for our very lives, to prevent another revolution? That's the bigger picture, and it's got your face on it next to his. You should work on my campaign. I can't abandon this task that I have undertaken. You know I would do anything for you. I can't let Andreas destroy himself. You were so sure of yourself that it was a done deal if we sent you to London. I said it from the beginning. The case for reunification is a distraction and waste of time and money! You give the rest of the news to "the bullfighter." I'm done with him. When Andreas left Greece all those years ago, he didn't just leave us, he left his Greek spirit as well. Petros, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry for me. The man you see, his heart you do not know. Remember how it used to be? Not really. I don't know what brought me back here. I think it was a memory. Make Athena your goddess and love. Know that she was built by courage and duty and the shame of failure. There is something you must know: In the choice between water and peace, I choose peace. Athena's gift to man was peace. Athena's gift was the olive tree. The tree is evergreen. It is a gift from our ancestors, but it is a heavy burden, far too heavy for one person to bear. Eleni... I have to go. I don't belong here. I'm going to tell you a story, my child. It begins in a time before we knew the grace of Athena... when we were lost. Thousands of years ago, the people of Greece nominated Athena as their representative to the world. The chastity of her body and the strength of her resolve symbolized the pure and ultimate justice that she would provide. This is the story of who we are. A reader of history will walk from room to room, like chapters in a great anthology, comparing the pinnacles of civilization side by side, and will come to the unavoidable realization that we are all derived from the very same human audacity. Every Athenian knew the truth about the world through the story of the Parthenon. The grand pediment that depicted Athena's contest for justice to have its day over the people. The blood-soaked metopes that surround and shield the building from the chaotic world outside.... showing that sacrifice and agony were necessary to protect the civilized society that flourished within the temple. Art as such is a living memory, a voice of a people, a vision of an ideal. These treasures of the world are sacred. They help to weave a tale of common thread. Listen to the voices of those who raised you. Nobody raised me. It is the only evidence we have of our divinely inspired origins. "Make Athena your goddess and love." The hope of the people is burning out. As is the case, the people of Athena eventually yielded to the rage of the world. We are all alone... But for thousands of years thereafter, the physical Athena remained, withstanding an onslaught of erosion and damage from foreign nations. She bore it with dignity all alone... ...as her armor became blemished with cannon fire. It was not until a contingent of men descended upon the sacred place, mechanically deflowering the defenseless goddess, cleaving the art from her unadultered womb, that her divine mission was compromised. ...when we should be standing together as one. Athena's justice is as immaculate as her purity. However, her virginity, her very shred of incorruptness was stolen when the men sawed the stone from the pediment, committing an act of rape that has gone unvindicated for more than 200 years. Imagine... that the defender of justice and civilization has been served the ultimate injustice. What hope is there for us? Hello? Alexis? What time is it over there? I heard about it. Congratulations on your promotion. Really? Now? So what's so damned important? Good evening. Oh, don't say it's the Egyptians now! What? No. Our dogged opponents are refusing to yield. A new Greek government has convened, and a splinter group of politicians are refusing to sign any more austerity measures until an appeal about the Marbles has been heard at the ICJ. It's turned into a political movement. Oh, when will these people ever give up? Since when did the Greeks ever care about anything? I'm sorry? I-I-I am flummoxed. I've had it with this prevailing sympathy for ungrateful good-for-nothings who have zero appreciation for anything that happened before the invention of pension plans. What would you like me to do? Nothing. They are not getting back what doesn't belong to them. They are our marbles for God's sake. This place used to terrify me when I was a child. All these petrified faces and... nightmarish mythological beasts from the past, living in the quiet of these giant halls. Megalithic Ramses bearing curses and all. Of course I see it differently now, but it still unsettles me. The ICJ. Ha! In a dramatic turn of events, the political party "The Promakhi" has emerged victorious and is supporting an appeal for the return of the Parthenon Marbles. The party's leader, Sophia Floris, awaits an official endorsement from the Prime Minister's Office before proceeding. We promote you, and this is how you repay us? Tell us now, are they paying you off? How much money are they paying you, Alexis? Gentlemen, I have no association with the Promakhi or anyone in their political organization. However, I do agree with their goals. This is all we need right now! A group of suicide bombers to destroy all of our hopes of getting our next bailout. How can you call yourself a man? I am not the man that you should be speaking to. That man is on his way here right now. This is some petty revenge that you are seeking for your failure. You people are holding our economy hostage. Do you know what damage you have done? The people suffer because of your arrogance! The people suffer because instead of leaders they have cowards. Leave me with this man. Please sit down. This office is not accustomed to existentialism. This man is not accustomed to asking for help. What do you need? Your support. You have it. I don't really have any other choice, do I? However... I need to know, do we stand any chance of winning? No. We need to try anyway and try our best. Our redemption is written in those stones. Do we want to see the museums of the world emptied? Do we want to rip out the binding and cast them into the wind? Because that is exactly what will happen if we set off on this rash and destructive course! Sending the Marbles away from their current home of cultural exchange would reduce the world's knowledge. I beg you all. Keep the Elgin Marbles where they belong. Keep them safe and free from harm. Reunify the Marbles, so that Athena and her people can be made whole. Reunify, so that in their solidness, the Greeks may find meaning once again. Reunify, so that justice may be served to its defender. Someone needs to stand up for Greece and make the case for her. Like the one who fights in the first line. There is no divine justice, Andreas. There is only the justice that men and women are willing to fight for. I'm fighting for divine justice. In front of this sacred temple, there used to stand a great statue. The bronze colossus at the front step of the Parthenon was named Athena Promahos. The statue was so imposing that the glint of the tip of her spear and the crest of her helmet could be seen as far away as Cape Sounion. Though the statue was long ago melted down and sold for scrap, and though all that remains today is a fragment of this statue's marble base, the great warrior still stands with any Athenian who is willing to defend her city's honor. And as gold represents enlightenment, it is bronze that symbolizes courage and duty. We chose a woman... Athena... because as men, we can love her. We can sacrifice for her to prove our love. We can stand with her in the first line of defense, so that justice may have its day. Athena's line is invincible. It is one that in service of humanity defies both time and space. One that preserves in stone and metal the memory of our past and the story of our future... standing in defense of what we hold most dear. The first line in history. The line that will never be broken again. The line of the Promahos.
