(RUSTLING WINDS) (SOMBER BEAT MUSIC) (WIND HOWLING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (UPLIFTING MUSIC) (SHEEP BLEATING) (SOMBER BEAT MUSIC) Hey! (WATER TRICKLING) (MUFFLED SPEAKING) (WATER BUBBLING) (WATER SPLASHING) (HEARTBEAT THUMPING) (WIND HOWLING) I must speak to Naomi, wife of Elimelek. That's my mother-in-law. She's coming. Naomi. What? What has happened? I'm sorry. NAOMI: What? Ruth, is it Mahlon? I'm sorry, your son's been killed in battle. No. No, there's some mistake. Ruth, it's okay, it's all right. Who are you? I don't even know who you are. (SOLEMN MUSIC) No. No. No. No. No. (NAOMI SOBBING) Why have you taken everything from me! No I can't. I can't breathe. (HEAVY BREATHING) I can't bear it! Oh, it's all right. (GIRL SOBBING) (HOWLING WINDS) (SLOW PACED MUSIC) NAOMI: Everything, we're trying everything. My daughter-in-law, is really, she's gonna get some work. And I'm gonna go into the village to get some... Look... Look, if you could just give us a little more time. One week, and then the rents due. Thank you. Thank you. We're running out of food. We'll have to sell some things. Have you decided what to do? Whether to go back home. Home. I don't even know what I'd be going back to. A widow, no sons, no grandsons. No name to carry on. God has left me nothing. There I'd be nothing. Even the land my husband and I left there doesn't belong to me without a man to own it. There must be some way. Only if some relative redeems the name and the land by marrying one of the family. And I don't see how that could ever happen. I'm far too old to marry again. And you're too foreign. I can't believe you want me to sell his things! I didn't say that, I just asked if you had anything... You might be a cold-hearted witch, but I'm not! Orpah, we're going to starve. I don't care! Okay. We should have enough for now. (SOLEMN MUSIC) How much for these? Let me look. I'll give you 10 for the sword, and one for the clothes. Is that all? MALE: That'll fetch you more. No. No, just the sword and shoes. As you wish. (COINS CLANKING) (MALE HUMMING) Thank you. Pleasure doing business. Good day. It's not as much as I'd hoped. Did you really sell his sword? What are you doing? What's going on? Why are you packing? I'm going home. Back to Bethlehem. I've heard it's a rich thriving country these days. I'm sure someone will take pity on a poor old widow like me. But, what about us? You have your own families to go back to. (SLOW PACED MUSIC) I miss him Ruth. I want him back. I know. My father's already sent word saying if I go home they have a suitor for me. Marry again? So soon? They don't want me to be a poor widow with nothing Ruth. And we can't work like men and an unmarried woman is a weakness. A target. I've told my father I'm going with you. I'll be there to help you with Naomi. We'll be strong together. (WATER SPLASHING) (WINDS HOWLING) I can't do this anymore! Orpah, let me help you. ORPAH: I can't go... A carrot for you. Naomi. Orpah honey. Orpah, it's all right, it's all right. Don't cry. I'm scared. I know. It's all right Orpah, it's all right. Ruth, take her home. What? We're not that far. If we turn around now we'll be home before dark. But. What about you, what if someone attacks you? Oh I'll be all right. No one's gonna bother an old woman like me. I cannot give you any security. I can't protect you, you'll, you'll have no future here and they will not marry women from Moab. RUTH: Naomi, we're coming with you. No Ruth. You are not. (LIGHT SLOW MUSIC) ORPAH: Ruth?

Looks to be a good one this year. Hello. Felt the need for a companion then Caleb? Couldn't find a wife, so you got a dog. She's for the harvest. Keep the riff-raff away. The poor come to these fields Caleb, to pick up everything that's left behind. It's their only way of surviving. The laws welcome them in our fields. Not a dog. (SLOW PACED MUSIC) (PERKY MUSIC) (LIGHT MUSIC) Hey! A Moabite with morals. I've never seen that before. Dirty scum. This is what I was afraid of. What did you do? Did you smile at him, encourage him? I didn't do anything. Didn't you see what he did? They think Moabite women are there for the take Ruth. They think you're easy. I should never have let you come. Naomi. Eunice. What happened to you? Where's Elimelek? Where are your sons? Naomi... Don't call me Naomi. Naomi means joy. Call me Mara, bitterness. For my life is nothing. Naomi, Naomi. Oh, it's okay. It's all right, you're fine. Would you get some water please? It's still here. (LIGHT UPLIFTING MUSIC) Elimelek. Huh? What? NAOMI: Mahlon, go inside. Why? NAOMI: Just go. Are you sure we're doing the right thing? Now? We're doing this now? NAOMI: What if it's wrong? What's wrong about not wanting to starve? Naomi, we've discussed this. People are dying and there's no food here. All that's left to survive. Do you wanna stay just to die? NAOMI: It feels, it feels like we're abandoning our friends. It feels like we're giving up on God. The God who has always protected our people. Yeah, really? Well I'd like to see where he is right now. NAOMI: Elimelek... I will not stay and watch my son starve just to prove to you my trust in God. Get the children, we're leaving. So this was your house? Yes. Kilion and Mahlon were both born here. Well Ruth, would you like to live here? (FAST PACED MUSIC) Yes. So Mahlon, this was your beginning. Now it's mine. (PERKY MUSIC) Your father built this land from the ground up. It's yours now. My beautiful, handsome boy. What are those people doing there? It's the poor ma'am. And the foreigners. The last season we left the corner... Godless creatures. Get rid of them. Oh my boy, you're all grown up. If only your father were here. If only. Mothers love, nothing like it. Oh, who's she? She's a bit of all right. She's no one. Just a poor begger. It's all right. I understand. I know what it's like to have all the girls fawning all over you. Wanting you, desiring you. We're the same you and me. (BEE BUZZING) There's something on you. BOY: Come on here. This is ridiculous. It's all very well planting your own food but it's never gonna grow in time to feed us. Let me go and work in the fields. No! We can sell what I clean for profit. Do you know what sort of people, men work out there. It's too dangerous. Anyway, you'd be hard pressed to find somewhere that will let you in. Well let me try. Let me see if there's a field that will take me. NAOMI: You're impossible. Hi, I'm Sheyla. Ruth. Don't worry, they pretty much ignore me too. Listen, about the other day, it wasn't how it looked. RUTH: Wasn't it? MALE: All work! Have you done this kind of work before? Never. The harvesters leave the corners of the field for us. Work quickly and stay with me. Don't go near them, and for heavens sake, don't smile at them. They'll think it's an invitation. Their law says they have to leave the edges of the field for us. That doesn't mean they think anything of us. Scum, that's what we are.

He was just also deciding whether he'd like to acquire Ruth, the Moabite. Where the deed of the land is a requirement of the law. What! Excuse us! AMI: Mother! If you do this, you will be forever the man that married that woman! A Moabite! Everyone will look down on you! Your whole family! But mother, I... Not only that, you'll be putting the future of your nieces and nephews and brothers and sisters in grave danger! And me!
