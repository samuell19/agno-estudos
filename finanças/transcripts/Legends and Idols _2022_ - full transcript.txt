[rapid swishing] [Willard] In order to manifest, you must first have the vision. [upbeat synthesizer music] You have to then put all your thoughts and energies and vision into visualizing your thing and bring it to yourself. In order to be its highest and best, you have to be doing it not at the expense of others, not just to visualize it, but to modify all of your behavior. So, all of your purposes, all of your behaviors, are for the manifestation of that desire. ♪ Legends and Idols ♪ ♪ ♪ Legends and Idols ♪ ♪ ♪ Legends and Idols ♪ Hi, I'm Willard Snow. I'm an artist from Redondo Beach, California. I paint rock star portraits, I paint musical instruments, giant guitars, and so much more. After completing my MFA, Master of Fine Arts degree in San Francisco, which is like a doctorate... a Ph.D. in art, I worked as a graphic artist. I worked as a faux finisher. I've been a metalsmith, which was really awesome. Heck, I even sold ice cream for a while, while I was dreaming of painting and starting an art community. More recently, I was living down by the beach, splitting things between web design, graphic design, building a business, trying to have an income, and painting. And I was managing my web design clients and had one big client, and they had a major piece of engineering that they wanted. And it was paying the bills, but it wasn't what I wanted to do. I wanted to get back into painting. You know, I was looking to get back into art instead of doing what was practical. It reminded me of that ice cream gig. I was raising kids, we were raising the family, I really needed the money, and the job was good. But I really needed to get back to my art. And my boss was sensing my frustration. And had a talk with me. And I decided to quit. And when I got home, my wife at the time told me she was pregnant. And I thought that I had just made the biggest mistake. But working there all day just was not what I wanted. You know, my heart definitely wasn't there. I had a friend who knew a gallery chain owner with high-end clientele. Beverly Hills, Las Vegas. So, we got excited and tried to get an appointment to show my art. - Hey, Douglas. - Hey, Willard, how are you? - Good to see you. - Come on up. [Willard] We met at his office hoping to schedule an introduction to the gallery owner. They talked on the phone and all the owner wanted to know was which galleries I had already been showing in. It was a familiar catch-22. The meeting went nowhere. [Mark] Undeterred by the catch-22, Willard did what he always does when confronted by setbacks. He dove back into a painting he'd been working on. [soft string music] It was the culmination of many of his ideas and drawings that he had been doing for quite a while. Then he got a new idea. When he started painting these abstract, black and white paintings, you know, they were amazing, very brilliant. And I was looking at him thinking, "Wow, it's like there's something trying to come out." There's like, a face, or an animal, or something. Like, I could see it in there. [Willard] I decided to start painting portraits of, uh, rock and roll legends. [dramatic rock and roll music] I was ready to make some changes to my life. I kept hearing about people finding free places to work, or these great spaces to work, these live-work spaces. Artist's lofts, warehouses. And that's what I needed: More space. [Mark] He tapped into his vast network of friends and let them know that he was looking for a free place to work. And within a few months, it popped up. [relaxing guitar music] [Willard] I called a friend to say hi, and I was shocked to hear from his wife that he had dementia. So, we talked, and she offered me her garage. ♪ So, I had a temporary studio. And, uh, she was an artist. She understood my need. And so, she wanted to help me. ♪ But I would call your name ♪ In April of this year, I was introduced to Mike Bradford. And he asked me if I wanted to show my paintings at his CD release party. Um, that was pretty exciting. And then it was more exciting because the CD release party was at the Gibson Guitar Showroom, which is a beautiful venue. And while I was there with my work, uh, Linda Hayden really enjoyed my work and asked me if I would like to paint one of these 10-foot Les Paul guitars. So, then, you know, the Guitar Town curator called me and told me he'd get me the... Actually, he didn't call me. He just sent me an email saying he was going to send me the application, that I needed to fill the application out. And, uh, you know, that they would get back to me and they'd, you know, get me a guitar by July 11th or something. And I was like, "No, no, no, no, no. I'll fill out the application and everything, but you gotta get me a guitar now." And then I kind of told them why, 'cause we were doing the shows. Gibson sponsors, uh, the Sunset Music Festival. As part of the Sunset Music Festival, they give these guitars for the Guitar Town Museum to artists to paint. They asked me to participate, and I wrote a proposal that I would paint Bob Marley, Janis Joplin, Jerry Garcia, and Marc Bolan on these 10-foot Les Paul sculptures. So, Willard grabbed four of these guitars when they were offered to him. And I thought, "God, he's... I don't know, he's maybe biting off a little more than he can chew, because there was a deadline and his work can be very detailed. He gets really into, uh, the process. You can see a lot of detail in his work, and he didn't just paint the fronts. He also painted the backs. Again, a lot of them with very intense detail. It was a lot of work. And I remember going over there one day and he had been up all night trying to finish one of the guitars. And he was just, like, totally burned out, couldn't push a paintbrush anymore. And it still wasn't done. And the deadline was, like, a couple days away. It was coming up pretty quick, and he still had a lot more work to do. I've always listened to music when I did art "cause it creates the creative space. There was a time when I wouldn't even look at a television program. It was just music, art, and the television might be on just as a moving picture, but we didn't... I never paid attention to it. It's probably because of music that I'm an artist. I have a background in, you know, academic art, but the thing that inspired me was music. And the thing that inspired me to get into the bands that I listened to was the album covers. Um... The sixth grade, my friends are playing Yes' Fragile. And, uh, you know, I was hooked. Um, and then all those artists: Emerson, Lake & Palmer. You got H.R. Giger, and then got Yes with Roger Dean, and you've got, uh, just so many bands who had a visual theme that ran kind of parallel to their music. And that's turned me on a lot. And then on top of it, they were great. My art is an outgrowth of that.

[metal clanging] [screw whirring] [gentle guitar music] [Mark] Wow, it's... it's looking like it's almost done. Just the neck, I gotta finish the neck. [Mark] Ah, it's coming out good. [Willard] So, I had my free space to work in, but no income. And I saw an opportunity, you know, to go in a new direction, do something profound that I couldn't do by myself, but could with a major musical instrument company. Although Gibson paid for the paint, the Guitar Town gig was a non-profit for charity. It was hard spending all night and day painting towards the deadline. Luckily, I have good friends and I've helped them, and they stepped up and helped me. It was two o'clock last night, four o'clock the night before. [Mark] Coming out really nice. This one I think is your best one so far. [Willard] Yeah, I think so too. I gotta paint. So, we got the hu... beach reporter guy com... What time is it? He's coming over here noon. - Eleven. - He's going to be coming in an hour. So, we gotta clean this place up a little bit. "Cause it's total entropy. [Mark laughing] [electric guitar riff] I actually did four portraits: Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Gar... no, Bob Marley, and, uh, Marc Bolan. And then, uh, a friend of mine named AC Alexander, who's a lead guitar player for, uh, Mike Bradford. Um, Mike Bradford has produced Madonna, Dave Stewart, and Deep Purple, and Kid Rock, and... AC showed him my paintings and suggested that I show the paintings at the CD release party at Gibson. And, uh, these are going to sell, um, at auction... end of the year, beginning of the year. And they'll probably sell for about $20,000. [Celtic violin music] It all kinda dovetailed... about junior high, 'cause I've always been drawing. You know, my sister had me drawing uh, these patterns that looked like fire. And if you look at my... the Johnny Cash painting that, uh, I sold to Peter, that is one of the first kind of pattern designs that I... I started drawing that when I was, like, six years old watching Star Trek with my sister, Jeannie, 'cause she was doing it. And she would write words and fill pages with colored pen, and... and I would copy her. And I started copying anatomy drawings, and I was always attracted to this biomorphic stuff. And I just got more into pattern. And then, yeah, we get into rock and roll, and we're giving each other album covers. And then in junior high, I start working, uh... for the newspaper, doing art for the newspaper, and just getting steered in the direction of being the creative tool. So, "Oh, yeah, we need that. He... Billy Snow can do that." And then it just kept on, you know? We're giving each other album cover... albums and... And getting all turned on to that. And then, um, I'm copying it. I do some work for the newspaper, and everybody, all my friends and, you know, my parents, and teachers are all, "That's... that's the thing, you know, that you're gonna do."

[upbeat electric guitar music] [Willard] I have a friend, AC Alexander. He was a lead guitarist in a touring band, and I had built a website for him. I'd known him a few years. And one day he called and asked me if I'd paint this custom-made guitar that he was having built. I was excited, for sure. And, uh, he sent me the body, and after I was finished with the body, I shipped it off to the guitar maker. [electric guitar music] ♪ [knocking] - Hey! - [Willard] Hey. - Steve. - [Willard] Will. Will, nice to meet you. Come on in. [AC playing electric guitar music] - Hey, hey! What's up, Will? - Hey. Good to see ya, man. How you doing? - [Willard] Good. - Check it. Here she is. My heaven prime baby, ready in action. So, tell us what you've done. - Um... - What'd you do to it? Well, what has been done that's new... wraparound bridge. [clicking tongue] Right in there. And to get around, I wanted the Gibson element to be able to do the ace freely. Check, check, check, check, check, check, check. Wanted to be able to do that because I'd have the space and I didn't want to do anything within the art from the body that was pre-drilled. So, a handy little [clicking tongue] kill switch. Just put it in and it blends right in there. [switch clicking] So, what is that, a... So, what that does, it allows me to up go bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup. Allows me turn the tone on and off, on and off, on and off like a cut circuit. [electric guitar playing on-and-off] I can't do that, there's not a room and a crowd in here, and it was already pre-done. - [Willard] - Yeah. So, I didn't want to drill anything more, - put anything else. - Sure. It was the same thing too, within... coming within this, because we tried other companies, but the studs were already drilled. [Willard] Ah, shit. And so, for this bridge right here... This is the TuMcrow's bridge, it's what fit. Because to fill in dowel and redo would... Now I'm drilling into art. [Willard] Well, the most important thing is that it's a quality piece. As long as it's a good quality piece, you're going to get some good tone out of it, right? [electric guitar music] ♪ Seeing Willard and getting to know him and his art, it was absolutely fantastic. So, I tracked him down, and phoned him, and I said, "Willard, I'm having this guitar custom-made. It has all of these things, you know, that I'm combining into it that, you know, other companies have done that I all wanted in one guitar, and I want you to paint it. And I'm not gonna tell you what I want. I just want you to paint it." I gave him the body, and gave him the neck. And about two weeks later came back... this amazing, amazing piece of art. When it went back to the finishing guys with the clear coating because it was raised up, the specific paint that was used... the acrylic, uh, from the white over to the other white, over to the black... they're like, "Oh, how do we do this, and rub it, and buff it down, and get the contours to sit right?" And what it was, was, "No," I said, "Don't smooth it out. Every single design pattern you hear right here, I can feel underneath my fingertips." And I'm telling you not only is it visually... um, it, you know, gets you moving, there's so much going on to it. There's also a feel thing. There's a touch as well, too, when I'm playing the instrument, not just playing within the fretboard, and you know, playing over the strings here, but just the way that it feels against the body, the way that it feels against the arm, the way that it sits. - And it has unleashed... - [laughing] hours and hours and hours of inspiration to me. I love the way this guitar plays. And it just feels so pocketed, it feels so comfortable, thanks to what the guys at Acacia did in making such an awesome guitar. And with Willard's inspiration in it, I feel that right there, that attention to detail, every single time that I pick this one up, and that I sit, and I write, and I work on it. And for my solo record that I'm doing right now, that I'm doing with, um, Michael Bradford producing, this really has been the workhorse so far in all of the writing. This has been the one in my lap. It feels the best when I'm Pro Tooling on my laptop and everything else. So, I absolutely love it, and it's unique. And to think that it's not just a really cool design, this is a... a real piece of art, you know? What if, uh, you know, Da Vinci or somebody else paints something on some instrument, you know? "Oh, great," you know, later on is he's so great, you put it up on the wall and this then becomes something. Well, I know that I have something very special here within the artwork that Willard Snow does. But instead of putting it up on the wall, no, it's getting workhorsed. It's in the studio, it'll be on stage. It fly with me wherever I go. So, having that relationship with an instrument, knowing that that's your, you know, that's your go-to and that's what you like, that's what you really feel within set for the way that it's put together. It's... It's awesome. [upbeat electrical guitar music] ♪ [Willard] I was stressed out up to the last minute getting the four giant guitars finished for the Sunset Music Festival. The paint was still drying on two of the guitars when they came to pick them up for the festival. ♪ Yeah, she's back in town ♪ One still wasn't finished, so I had to deliver it myself.

They put them up for display on the Sunset Strip and everyone... Thousands of people every day get to view them as they drive by. Who came up with the idea?

The real surprise is when they ended up in the center of Sunset Boulevard, [chuckling] Right at the... the entrance from Beverly Hills to... West Hollywood, where the most traveled areas of Sunset Boulevard, where, you know, stars are constantly going back and forth, and all the hot shots drive through there. And these guitars are right in the center divider, right where the traffic jam is. So, everybody slows down right there, and a lot of people have been noticing 'em. [Irene] When I first saw his painted guitar sculptures on Sunset Boulevard, I thought, "Wow, this can really give him a lot of exposure and... And be great for his career."” Then we went to the Andaz Hotel on Sunset, where he had two more. I think those are permanent. [Mark] Willard had to recover after painting the guitars. He didn't have much money because the Guitar Town event was for charity. There were backed up bills to pay, deferred maintenance, and he had to find a new studio since the free one he had was only temporary. So, he called on his clients and dug up new work, doing graphic design, and painting houses. [relaxing guitar music] [machines whirring] [relaxing guitar music] Start working my social media, just came up with this tribute post idea, every day important historical events, or birthdays that have occurred. I had some processing apps on my phone, and I played with them, and then I started compositing, and the apps could do a lot more than they could a year before. My life where I am... That's right. Yeah, we want to see the personal side, too. And you can do it yourself, and people actually like the raw... - [Willard] Yeah. - Um... They love that. They like it more raw, like, real, too. Yeah, okay, good. So, I... I... I'm working it pretty hard, and it's grown really fast. That's working hard, you know... [electric guitar music] [Mark] An investor discovered Willard online soon after. [Willard] He called me, "Hey, I'm really interested in your art. I want to help you. I think this Legends and Idols thing is really cool. I'd like to see it grow. I'd like to see it be a business and I can help you. I'm gonna have money." And then about a year later, he said, "I got the money. I got the money." And I said, "Really?" He said he wanted to move to California, and, "I want you to find a building for us." And we would work on his enterprise, and I would have a studio. [whimsical electric guitar riff] My new investor secured this spot for our new gallery with a hefty deposit on a handshake, which got us into the building. We then began negotiating the lease with Tony, the landlord. I called John Felix to help manage it. This guy that owns the building, you know, he's like, "Well, you know..." [Willard] John had a gallery near Beverly Hills for quite some time and ran it successfully until he lost his lease and had to close it. [John] Definitely get the floors done. [Willard] He had a roster of great artists and a lot of ideas. And he wanted to get back into it, so we decided that we would do something together. Another is just the regulatory... You have to... You have to deal with another entity, and their property and their... It's going to take forever for them to come and see... So, this kinda another... [indistinct] the door, absolutely. I'm with you, I'm for it. Windows on the front. A window on the front. It's good and bad. There's gotta be some kinda... - [Willard] Well... - -budget, right? [Willard] Yeah, we just don't... we're just not sure where that budget's coming from right now. [John] Right. [Willard] And my investor wanted to cut a big picture window into the front of the building. He wanted to move the sewer line. He started becoming, uh, very difficult. [John] They want to see in. Yeah, people can see in. We can put a sculpture in the window and... and we can put bars across the back like they did. And do decals on the windows of the show, [indistinct] do, too. We have a huge window. - Yeah, okay. - And you have whatever the show is, and it's like a marquee. So, windows... And the date... It's not a bad thing. Just... I'm worried about time. [Willard] And window we'll get... yeah, well, that's the thing. This place is great because, um, there's no front window. - Yeah. - And that's awesome. You don't want a front window. It creates intrigue, and people talk about what's inside. [Willard] Johnny's an internationally famous artist who does art shows all over the world, and he was in Los Angeles. So, we called Johnny and Sasha, and they came over. And you put... You put a sign up in there, the gallery space, and you make it really cool. [Willard] And it's pretty inexpensive. [Mark] So, that's what it would look like. [Willard] Yeah. [Mark] You don't even have to paint it. There it is. [Johnny] You lease it out as an artist space. And you say to young emerging artists that's around the corner who wants to have his own show, you go, "Mate, it's 500 bucks a week." You know, I've been around the world, man. I've worked with so many galleries, there's so many ways of doing it, to... you know, - to make it happen, you know? - Yeah. That Johnny Romeo is a true professional. He's got this business wired. He, uh... really good ideas. He knows... He's got a staff, he's got his publicity. He's got his... his crew, uh, his... and his art... is awesome, but he's really got it down to a science. One of the young artists route, coming artist that's on the art council for their "mailing list..." [Willard] I just started following him on Instagram. And you instantly got, like, you know, um... They... they mail it... mail out to... to all the law firms all the solicitors, all the judges in the area. Massive. - People with money. - People with money. [Mark] How long have you known him? Johnny Romeo did our last show at Peacher Gallery. So, uh, I'd say a couple of years. Actually, I met him before that. So, I'd say three or four years again. This is in the second half of, uh, Peacher Gallery, so that's when I met all these new guys. I do stupid things like that, where I've got just #JohnnyRomeo and follow JohnnyRomeoArt. I've got 100,000 fans worldwide on Instagram. And people put that and they pin it. And then they take photographs and hashtag me. And so, everywhere I go, I've got a crowd. Nice. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Yeah, so that works, you know? - Very good. They're... They're the little kind of tricks that you might need to kind of employ to build up the database... - Yeah. - -build up a following. I'm always interested in textures and patterns, and it started... I was probably five or six years old, 'cause my sister Jeannie was in high school. And she would draw these patterns that looked like flames. And then I just expanded and continued to expand that image. Didn't really hit me until, um... maybe, probably college that, "Oh, this is what interests me. Texture." I was doing lithography, and lithography has these reticulated patterns that naturally form in... From the medium after you draw. And I was totally hooked on that, this beautiful reticulation. Yeah, patterns and textures will take me places. We grew up in Southern California. The ocean, uh, the mountains, uh, the seashore, the cliffs, the tide pools, the creatures in the tide pools. Everything's textural and, you know, pattern. [relaxing guitar music] [Irene] At this point, everything was going well. He and I were getting along great.

[Willard] Okay. I was a contract negotiator in health care for many years. Tony is just calling me. I don't want to talk to that guy. [Patti] Shit, no. Tony? Tony. He was just calling me. [Patti] Okay. Don't... You have nothing to say. No, I know. ...pretty much made myself a mother to Willard, or a mentor. Um, when I met him, he was such a... a sweet man, and, um, seemed very generous, very brilliant. I mean, absolutely brilliant. I kind of took on asserting myself and, uh, telling him how he should move forward, because I see him really going places in the future. I don't even know the guy, I met him once. [Patti] And you hate him. I... I talked to him once on the phone. I said, "This guy is nuts. Not gonna work." And he comes here and just pulls the whole plug out, and then Tony gives him all his money back. I didn't have the money, I was trying to get the money. And like, everybody's like, "Okay, maybe we'll do it." And then he's backed out again, and I told everybody it's off. So, they're like, "Oh..." So, I'm gonna come back to them again, "Oh, it's on again." They're gonna... You're insane. He can give enough that we can make this enterprise work out, we can. [Willard] Frank was the leasing agent working hard with us, trying to help us stay in the big gallery next door. But my investor wasn't moving forward, and without him, it just was too much. March and April, we... We... we had a good plan going and was going to get us off to a... a pretty nice start with a nice show with good artists and, uh... Is that o... Is that completely off the table? Well, we... we planned the whole thing. We said cancel it. No, we told him... We cancelled it and told all the... all the people involved... - Yeah. - -that it was, uh, you know... There was uncertainty about renovations and things with the building. And we didn't want... [John] Right, we didn't say we were dead in the water. Yeah. Yeah, we just... we... Yeah, we didn't... - [John] We were... - We said just... We said, - "Hold on." - Right. "Hopefully we'll be able to, you know, reschedule this for soon." And they all said, "Okay, tell... let us know." When Patti said, "Go get a trailer," Irene said, "Oh, my God. I don't want to do that." And then the more she thought about it, and thought about getting out from under the stress and everything, and my ability to stay here and work, she said, "Okay, let's go. Let's do it." [Irene] I bought the trailer so we could avoid expensive leases and stay focused on the art at Patti's antique store. Willard got a nice workspace in back, and I helped out in the store. It turned out to be a smart move. [Frank] As long as you're working, you're doing what you love, man, that's all that matters. [Willard] There may be a deal to be made. - But he's got... - Okay. To make his deal with Tony - and it's gotta be done. - [John] And be done. So, that would be him leasing the building? [John] Yeah. Him leasing the bottom floor moving forward and you guys would be a partnership. You guys would lease this, but if you wanted to work together, then he could hire you. So, moving forward here, I'm gonna go back and just relaying to Tony that, you know, we're releasing any of the responsibilities of space. We'd s... We'd still be friends. None... None... It doesn't have to be bad. We're not leaving on bad terms here. Good. No, we all understand. [John] Well, I was... I wasn't in on any of this stuff. I was brought in to set up the gallery. And I'm like... [Frank] Yeah. He... He's just been watching the whole story - going, "Oh, yeah, two..." - [John] I can... I can... I can... I know how to set up a gallery, I know how to I run a gallery, and I know how to line up artists, I know how to put on events. - [Frank] Yeah. - That's my thing. I'm gonna see what happens. You know, you don't... you don't know what's going to happen. - [Willard laughing] - [John] That's for sure. [woman] I'm going to go see it. I've just been so... - [man] Overworked. - [woman] Excited. [cars humming in the background] [Mark] So, you had an investor from New York. Tell us what happened with him. Um... I don't know what happened, "cause I'm not in his brain. [slow, low pitched guitar music] It wasn't fun. It was extremely, uh, traumatic and sad, "cause, you know, you get assurances. I gave him a lot of goodwill, like, two and a half years of goodwill: Talking for about a year, him telling me what he wanted to do. Me saying, "Okay, cool. That's great. I love it. When you got the Money, give me a call." I remember Andrew who came from Russia. He told me after he left, he goes, "Oh, I had it out with him." And I was like, "Damn." But then it did. It kind of did. We had a building. We were in the building. We had the landlord. The landlord had his deposit. Everything was moving forward. Um... but he was just difficult, you know? We had the space, the landlord had the check, and he started pulling these... these antics. Um, you know, he pulls out. And then he dangles the proposition again. But he's talking to the realtor, or he's talking to the landlord. And then he would dangle it to me. And then the realtor comes back to me, says, "Oh, hey, he wants to work with you. He wants to do this." And I said, "No, he doesn't. I started this painting there. I have, like, three others started that I was working on there." And he brings another artist from New York who has a gallery, who's selling, and he asks me if I can paint upstairs. So, I found the space. I did the work to meet the landlord, do all... everything. He held the carrot out that we were going to have this place to work, and to do for both of us. And then he brings another guy. It was all about him. Me, it was about what we were going to do. You know, yeah, it's about me. I'm part of it. But he was part of it, Irene was part of it, John Felix was part of it, um, Johnny Romeo. There was potential. Meeting Willard was a really high point in my life because I had closed my gallery, it had been a year and a half. And I was just really bottom, of the bottom of the barrel, down. And he brought me up, gave me hope, and we started this... This project and we'd become good friends, and not going to give up. And he's an incredible artist, too. That doesn't hurt. But uh, we're just going to keep pulling, keep pushing, and something's going to happen. I don't care if the investor backed out the last minute. We're going to go forward. We're moving forward. [coins jingling] [John] First time I saw Willard's art, it was something that just caught your eye and brought you right in, and you could feel what he was feeling. I thought it was awesome. When I see Willard's art, it makes me feel things. [chuckling] At this point, after all the hard work and invitations, you just hope a bunch of people show up, and hopefully some art buyers. Collaborating with Steve and Deirdre, the Vintage 47 store owners, allowed us to attract great musicians. Steve makes custom guitar amps that sound just like the amps of the '60s. [indistinct chatter] [Steve] We built four of these things. And we put some jacks that we actually drove his pickup truck on top of them. They're solid, all handmade. Absolutely. Are you guys registered to vote in San Pedro? Hell no. - No? - I don't live in San Pedro. Well, you can't help me tonight. Come in and take a look around. You can help us out. Maybe there's people in here who can vote. [indistinct chatter] - [John] Hello, welcome. - [laughing] What do you do on stage then? Try to make music. [Willard] At this point, I knew our show was happening. A lot of people coming in, gathering around, and great musicians. The music was awesome.

[melancholy violin music] [Willard] There's a lot of struggles that an artist has to go through. And the struggles aren't just because he wants to make an image, or create some statement, or communicate something important. Part of the struggle, you know, "Oh, how's he going to make money with that?" I remember relatives of my parents saying, "Oh gee, that's great. But how's he going to make money with that?" And... and I'm in earshot! And my parents are like, [scoffing]... "It'll be all right." A big problem for many, many artists is like, "Oh, the obstacle. Ugh, I gotta to pay the rent. Ugh, the next obstacle." And you're looking at like, the obstacle, but the goal is what you really need to look at. It's hard. I don't do it all the time. But I know it's true because my mentors who are successful are like, "Ah, look at the goal. Don't look at the obstacle." I started painting Johnny Cash 'cause my friend Peter commissioned me to do Johnny Cash. And I was painting the giant guitars, and I needed the money, so, the commission was very timely. And we were living over in Rolling Hills, and I decided to try to paint outside and build like, a tent studio outside. So, I put up the tent, and I started the painting. And then a giant wind came up and blew everything over and blew the painting across the garden, and it got a big rock through it. And I also broke another painting, and I decided that's not going to happen. I'm not going to paint outside, obviously. So, I put everything away. And then I started after we got here. [Mark] I got an idea. - Okay. - I want to know what you think. [Willard chuckling] [dog barking] I think you should leave the art to me. What do you think of the idea? Is it like Meals on Wheels? [Willard] I got invited to a big music business convention: NAMM. The NAMM show is always fun. There's great people to meet and great performances. I met Mike Bradford there. I went to the tech awards, and there was Keith Emerson of Emerson Lake & Palmer standing there. So, I met Keith Emerson! And he was such a nice guy. It's really cool to meet your idols. [serene violin music] ♪ [Mark] So, Lennon's almost done, huh? [Willard] Yeah, almost done. And now he's already sold. [Mark] Really? You sold it? [Willard] A guy came in the other night and was talking to me, and... very interested. And asked how much, and we dickered around. And then he came back the next night with $1,000 bucks, and we made a deal. [Mark] Well, that's great. [Willard] Yeah, it's pretty cool. I expect I'll see him in another week with another payment. [Mark] We got an appointment for sure with Mark Schulman, the rock star drummer that we were talking about. [Willard chuckling] The guy, uh, Foreigner, uh, Simple Minds, that guy? [Mark] Yeah, I think Billy Idol, P! Nk, he drums for P! Nk. So anyway, he's very curious about what you're doing, wants to see your art, and he invited us over to his studio. So, we're going to go over there in a couple days. - Meet a celebrity. [Chuckling] - [Willard] Right on. [upbeat electric guitar music] - [Willard] Good to meet you. - You are an amazing artist. - Oh, thank you. - Fantastic stuff. - Appreciate that. - Really, really, um... I don't know what he showed you. Well, I've just kind of seen stuff. - I saw some of the footage. - Yeah, right. And just some of the art. And you've seen the guitars up there. I mean, I'm a drummer. Don't hold that against me. But I still like a good guitar. I like a big guitar. You do big guitars. Size matters, I'm telling you. Yeah, I do do big guitars. [Mark Schulman] The way I look at it, nobody's gonna beat the shit out of my drums, or hurt my drums, more than I do. He gave me the guitar and said, "Paint my kid's guitar." - Oh, that's so awesome. - And I was like, "Okay." [Willard] He lives in Mexico. He's a pretty famous artist. [Mark Schulman] That's brilliant. [Willard] His name's Enato. And there... like, there's a lot of states. "Cause when you do this digital stuff, you can process it, and then tweak it... To me, it's like, you're the next generation of psychedelic. That's a nice thing to say. Like, you've taken... You've taken sort of existing, um, formulas, so to speak, and you're, like, expanding on it with technology. But it's... it's brilliant. Oh, my God. - You did those? - Yeah. I... I gotta buy some of that from you. - [Willard] Okay. - You kidding me? [Laughing] That is like, some of the coolest stuff I've ever seen. - What's it made of? - [Willard] It's chrome steel. - Oh, that's fantastic. - I could make it out of silver. So, I've got to ask you a question. I've got my own signature drum. Mm-hmm. The Mark Shulman signature drum. - It's the greatest drum. - Mm-hmm. Could I give you one of my drums and have you - do some artwork on a drum? - Yes, absolutely. I mean, will you touch a drum, or do you... Are drummers okay? Are we still cool? Are you kidding? So, you do the whole shell. Well, I'll show it to you, because this is the last year of the drum, um, because Gretsch is taking out all of the signature drums off the market. And this was like, the best-selling signature product in the history of Gretsch for a couple of years. - What is so... magical. - It's magical. And you do... and it also, it goes with... Which is my problem with guitars. They're so beautiful anyway. But I'm thinking what would be really cool is if I give you one of these drums and you just go to town. I won't even tell you what to do. You just do it, because that would be magical. I want to put this signature banner on it, back on it. So, it's still, says Mark Schulman. - Yeah, yeah, sure. - But it's your artwork on it. What has drawn you to wanting to paint instruments? Because... [clears throat] music... um, is probably the most impactful form of art. Music just makes people do crazy shit. Well, it's real time art. It's... Well, and musicians are shaman. They create a religious experience. And I'm a Schulman. [laughing] I'm an abstract artist, but I've always, you know... Who do you think my favorite artists were growing up? I don't know how. Oh, Roger Dean, John Van Hamersveld, Storm Thorgerson, um, you know who all those guys are. - Yeah. - Yeah. So... you know, I'm looking - at Rick Griffin album covers. - Yeah. You know, when I'm a kid, and I'm trying to draw... I'm trying to draw Yes album covers. Yeah, 'cause I saw... I saw Yes in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. "Cause they just got announced they're gonna get in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame - finally. - Yes. We all go through these, like, multiple lifetime experiences where, you know, you go... You start out, and when you get to the other side and move into whatever's next, you look back and you go, "Oh, my God." Where we have what I call cycles. Yeah, well... And the thing is that we learn and we respond based on previous cycles, and that brings us - to where we are now. - Mm-hmm. 'Cause this is a solid Rosewood drum. And that is... And that is just a... It's a painted finish. But this is such a brilliant drum. I actually handpicked this. [Willard] Oh, that would be fantastic. But I'm thinking that I just take all the hardware off, give you the shell, and you can go to town. [energetic electric guitar and drum music] ♪ ♪ ♪ [serene orchestral instrumental] [Irene] Look what I got. ♪ [Mark] When you got Irene that nice sapphire ring, you're obviously getting pretty serious about the relationship, right? So, what were you thinking? Um, well... she'd already asked me if I wanted to get married. And we'd already decided when. So, we needed a ring. And she said, "Oh, I want that ring. That's my engagement ring." And um, I was like, "Well, that's not a diamond." And she was like, "I don't care. I want that." So, it was just very simple... You know, the marriage actually... our relationship was one of the easiest things that ever happened in my life. I went to paint her house. And then we were like, "Oh, what?" But we've known each other, you know, we'd spent time together in spaces with friends, and we'd never made any connection prior to that. But, uh, you know, I went over there to paint her house, and that was it. The relationship just continued to get... We never really separated from each other after that. How long did it take before I took my bed over there? Do you remember? [Laughing] [Irene laughing] You know, I think maybe it was three weeks. No, it wasn't even that long "cause she didn't have a bed, and my bed was in storage. And I was like, "Well, I don't need it in storage. I need it here." [Irene] We moved out of Los Angeles, and he focused on the Bunnynose Guitar project, a collaboration with a custom guitar maker. [Willard] See, this one's a dye sublimation print. It went on the guitar body really nice, real easy. [upbeat synthesizer music] ♪ [music softens] [inaudible chatter] ♪ [upbeat electric guitar music] Hello. Here we are. - [Willard] Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you. [Mark Schulman] Willard's the artist. He's the one that made this drum. Oh wow. That is really beautiful, brother. Wow. - That's awesome. - That is so awesome. It's so great, I want to wear it! [Willard] I'm wondering though, do you have to use the hardware that came with it? Can you get more minimal hardware? It's up to you; It's gonna look beautiful no matter what. Haha. He's not a drummer. [Willard] Yeah. Oh, I know it's... - Would never ask that question. - [Willard laughing] Yeah, we're going to use the exact hardware. The only problem I see is that one of the most important things is where the... Where the head hits the drum is the bearing edge. Yeah, I understand. The bearing edge is a critical thing. And unfortunately we went over the bearing edge, and there's nicks, and there's some stuff here that's unfortunately going to affect the sound of the drum. But this is your first time doing it. - I can take it right now... - No, no, no, no. - We'll do the bearing edge. - I can go to Home Depot and I... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know. Gary's looking at me like, "No!" [Willard] Yeah, cool. Well, I'm excited. Where you're doing this sort of thing, which is something to note, because I didn't really caution you about the bearing edge. "Cause we can... 'cause Gary can do the bearing edge. Because what happens is the head goes over the drum, and then you're gonna have the hoop go over the head. This is so, so extraordinary, - and I want to recommend... - I understand... I mean, people are going to see this, people are gonna want to have stuff done. That's my hope. That's my hope, too. "Cause this is really phenomenal. It's brilliant. It's art. It's yours. Here we have the concept. What I was doing was, at the time, um, working on some pieces that had earth, air, fire, and water in the images. And I thought, "Well, I'll just carry that on." And so that's what I did. So, we have water that goes into earth. And then the earth I put some sort of animal, sort of forms, in here, and plant forms. And then they burst into flame, and then they go into air, you know, smoke and air, back into water again. So, when I see that, like, my art is expressed - through my music. - Right. So, to see you just conceive and conceptualize that, to me, is... It's absolutely brilliant. I'm so grateful because it's... - [Willard] Thanks. - It's a whole other skill set. [laughing] You know? That's beautiful. There it is with all of its glory. Hah, that is gorgeous. And whose... - Is this your guitar? - This is for sale. This is going to NAMM unless I sell it. It's going to be... there's a couple of booths that are going to have... - Bunnynose? - Bunnynose. We should let Justin try it out. Absolutely. - Nice to meet you, man. - [Justin] Thank you. - [Mark] So, he's been, uh... - Nice to meet you, man. Then he started doing guitars, and he painted my drum for me. But he brought this as well. Did you ever see the two guitars on Sunset in Beverly Hills? The Bob Marley one and the Janis Joplin one? They were in the middle of the road? [Justin] Uh, I don't think so. Maybe I never noticed them. [Willard] Yeah... They're down at Gibson - in the showroom. - [Justin] Okay. My first guitar was a Telly, and it was like that.

[Jon] We were at a party in Munich and Jimi was there, and I was in the corner... [Willard] And he told me his Jimi Hendrix story, which all classic rock musicians have. Jon was excited because he had met Jimi in Munich. He looked over... He looked over at me, I went... ...like that, and then he came over and sat down next to me. [Willard] And then later in London, Jimi remembered him. [Jon] In London, and I had just met Chris Squire. We went to see Roland Kird, great sax player. And in walks Jimi Hendrix with his guitar. And he walks over and looks at me and says, "Munich!" I said, "Yes!" I found myself, thank you! [Willard] And that was Jon Anderson's Jimi Hendrix story, that Jimi remembered him. [woman] Three, two, one. [cameras clicking] - Perfect. - Thanks so much. Can I... can I... Just really quickly, I just wanna show you my claim to fame, because you are kind of my idol.

So, this one's still at the Andaz Hotel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I just do this psychedelic stuff, which is why... This is what I'm working on. And uh, I do guitars. [Jon] I should send you my photograph of doing my Elvis impression. I do a version of it. Do you do that? Yes, I could do that, yeah. Um, in fact, see, these are just different. - I'm a rock and roll artist. - I love it. I did a drum for Mark Schulman who plays for P! Nk. I know! So, that's a guitar that I did. - Beautiful. - And that's Mark's drum. And he calls her Anna [indistinct]. This is where I live. I live out in the desert [indistinct].

Oh, wrong end. There you go. [Willard] The Jon Anderson thing was another instance of meeting somebody who's had a huge impact on my life. And he acted, like, interested. Interested in everybody, and super cool. Well, meeting Jon Anderson was special because that's a person that's, um, huge in my artistic and musical life. Introduced me to art and a realm of fantasy, and higher consciousness, and all kinds of stuff in these little discs. And uh, it was, you know, someone I've dreamed of meeting. I mean, physically had dreams that I was in the room talking to this person before. I was armed with something when I met Jon Anderson though, because I had the Jimi Hendrix Foundation. And I had done the art, and the painting, and they had contacted me to use it. And so, I gifted him the shirt and showed him the Hendrix Foundation thing. And I said, you know, it's official Jimi Hendrix Foundation merchandise. And he had his Jimi Hendrix story. So, he had to tell me, you know, the story about meeting Jimi Hendrix in Germany. [Mark] Were you a little bit starstruck at all when you met one of your idols like Jon? I've met a lot of people in the last few years, so, it was easier. I meet Keith Emerson at NAMM. Super gracious, super interested. I had the little 3D photograph of Les Paul, and there was some interest in doing a photograph of him. So, I had something to talk to him about, about this 3D photo. And he was like, "Oh, that's interesting. That's cool. You want to do that." And he took the picture, and he had the contact information. But I was like, other than that, "Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh." What do you say to this person? "Cause they're... you know, big. But he was just a guy, you know, wearing a button down, and having his champagne. And he was actually kind of shy. Um, Jon Anderson was more vivacious and bubbly. [wind chimes jingling] [woman] Hello. [indistinct chatter] [Irene] He'd been working on this Johnny Cash painting for over a year.

[birds chirping] [Mark] Looks like you manifested. What I was trying to manifest was either the time to work because I had a space, or the space to work, because I had the time. And the two things didn't always coincide. Now they coincide. [birds chirping] [Mark] How do you like it, Irene? I love it. You know, privacy. We have space. - Well, the neighborhood... - We live on a vortex. [laughing] Yeah. Also, I had never lived in a space bigger than like, 30 feet by 15, until we moved here. And now he has three acres. [Irene] He's the king of the three acres. [laughing] We were attracted to the area by a lot of things.
