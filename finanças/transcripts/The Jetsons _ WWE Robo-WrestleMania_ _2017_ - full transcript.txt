Roman, Roman, right here! - Sign mine. - Sign mine, Roman. Right here. Whoo, whoo... Wow! Uso. Uso. Hear me. Yes. I am the Big Show. I'm the future champion. He's big in person. Gigantic! Gotta get to see... Big Show, oh, oh, can I have your autograph? You want my autograph? Um... Yes. You want my autograph? I wouldn't have asked if I didn't. You just got the signature of the future WWE World Heavyweight Champion. Wrong, Big Show. Everyone knows that I am the undisputed future of WWE. And I will be the champ. Well, neither one of you fellows are gonna be the champ. While I hold the title. It's Sheamus. - Hooray! - What... What? - It's Sheamus. - Yeah. He's my favorite. Hello, my friends in Denver. In case you haven't heard, Big Show here has earned himself a match with me tomorrow at SmackDown. And he thinks he'll be taking my title away from me. Boo! I mean... Well, you're okay, but Sheamus is better. Tomorrow night, you're going down. You better find something else to hold your pants up. Because you can kiss that championship belt goodbye. I'm just waiting for you in Albuquerque, Big man. Bring it on! Nobody is bringing anything, anywhere tonight. Mr. McMahon. Oh, it's Mr. McMahon. Can you believe it? Big show, Sheamus, as Chairman and CEO of WWE, and your boss, I must postpone tomorrow night's match on SmackDown. - What? - What? What? A massive snowstorm is just about to hit the Denver area. The highway patrol is closing down all roads. Big Show, I'm afraid your title match will have to wait. Not again, McMahon. I've waited a long time for my chance to get the title. I'm not letting a little frozen water get in my way. But the bus can't drive in this weather. Who said anything about driving? Big Show, please. - You gotta turn back. - Forget it, McMahon. I'm going to be World Heavyweight Champion tomorrow night. And nothing will stop me. - Dumb technology. - Big Show. Turn back. Turn! You want a piece of me, gravity? You think you can take me down? Let's get it on. * Meet George Jetson * His boy, Elroy * Daughter, Judy * Jane, his wife Oh, this is grueling labor. I work my finger to the bone for this company and yet I'm completely under-appreciated. The next time I see that old miser Mr. Spacely I'm gonna demand a raise. Jetson! - You're... - Oh, no, please, Mr. Spacely, - I... I'm sorry... - Hired! Oh, I understand completely, Mr. Spacely. I'll clean out my office immediately. Office, let's pack up. No, Jetson, I said you're hired. Hired? Haven't I been hired this whole time? Okay, maybe that was a confusing way of phrasing this. Point is, I need you, George Jetson, to take on a new project. Oh, boy! Are you talking about a promotion? Well, if doing more work for the same money sounds like a promotion to you. Then let's call it a promotion. That's exactly what I'm gonna call it. I won't let you down, Mr. Spacely. You better not. Or you're fired! Report to the shuttle bay in five minutes. And, Jetson. No surprises! Oh, boy! "Report to the shuttle bay." That means a business trip. I hope the old space suit still fits. Last time I wore this, I was on the moon. Guess I weighed a little less there. Ah... There we go. Pardon me. Coming through. Hey, what's the big idea, George? That guy is a galactic goofball. More like a pain in the plutoids. Heya, George. Here to hide out from Spacely again? Not today. Mr. Spacely promoted me for an extra special project. Wow! Spacely Sprockets X-9000 robots. My new project must be hugely important. George Jetson? This new project is doomed. Careful there, Benedict. Extremely crucial project going on here. No room for mistakes today. No room for mistakes, huh? Then how did they make room for you on the project? Just gonna squeeze in here. Okay! I'm ready to go. Oh, I can't wait to get the details on this project. Launch in five, four... Three, two... Whoa! Hold the launch. Hold the launch. I better take this. Hello, Mr. Jetson. Your lovely beautiful wife is on line one. I can't talk right now. Take a message, please. But, Mr. Jetson, it's your wife. Are you sure you don't want to take this? Big project. Gotta go now. Bye. So, where we headed? One... Your husband isn't available, Mrs. Jetson. Not available like he's on his way to his son's science fair, where he's supposed to be? Or not available like he's putting work before his family again? He didn't specify. But if I were a betting woman, I know where I'd put my money if you catch my drift. May I take a message? No. I'll either to talk to him when he gets here or yell at him when he gets home. Uh-oh. Someone's in trouble. Look at this place. Three cold fusion experiments and a vinegar and baking soda volcano? No one else has anything as sophisticated as my time travel equation. Where's Dad? He promised he'd be here, Elroy. He's probably just trying to find a parking spot. Or at least he'd better be. Wow. The surface of the earth. So natural. So primitive. So disgusting. Unit one, what on Earth are we doing on the earth? We have been ordered to drill a hole for a new piling. And what am I supposed to do? You are in charge. In charge, huh? I like the sound of that. Well, then. You boys get to drilling, I'll stay here and... Be in charge. Commence re-calculated drill procedure. Ah, yes. A lot of responsibility. Lot of responsibility. Mr. Jetson. Huh? What? Who? I wasn't sleeping. You were sleeping. Mr. Jetson, we found something. Well, what do you know. There was already a hole in your hole. Protocol states, we cannot continue drilling until our supervisor has inspected the site and declared it safe. Ah... Me? Uh-huh. Any chance I can do that from right here? Uh-uh. No? Oh... Okay. I'm going in. Bye-bye. Boy, what a scaredy-cat. You're gonna be fine, George. Everything is okay, George. You're gonna be fine, George. Everything... Hey, guys, I made it. It looks pretty safe to me. Keep going, sir. Oh, darn it! Dumb drill bot. Who tells who what to do around here anyway? Oh... Who killed the lights? Spacesuit lights to maximum. Huh, much better. Well, I can't just leave him here. Boys, I think I'm gonna need some help down here! Oh... Look at this poor old-fashioned fella. Frozen in ice. This is some surprise. Right, guys? Mr. Spacely said no surprises. Come on. Come on. Melt faster. Melt faster. Shh... Be quiet. Mr. Spacely said no surprises. And you are one big seven-foot surprise! Would you be quiet? You're gonna get me fired. What? What? Oh, my bad. Where am I? Spacely Sprockets. My office. Which won't be my office much longer - if you'd don't... - Jetson! It's Mr. Spacely. You gotta hide. Chair! Chair? What are you doing back? Oh, job's done. So soon? Any surprises? Nope. No surprises. No surprises? Wow, Jetson. I should have given you a fake promotion months ago. What's that noise? Oh, that's just Pickenpock in accounting. Little game we play. Well, tell him to stop it. It's annoying. You got it, Mr. Spacely. Phew. You better tell me what's going on before I snap you in half! No snapping necessary. Last thing I remember, I was on an airplane... If you could just set me down. Flying out of Denver in a snow storm. Over there would be great. On the ground. And then I was standing in a puddle of water. With your hand over my mouth. So I'm gonna ask you one last time... Where am I? Orbit City. Am I in the future? Hiya, George! But to me it's just now. But to you, probably, yes. Jetson! We got to get you out of here. Pickenpock in accounting said you're the one banging on the wall. Jetson? He's not even here. Pickenpock! Ooh. I am so mad at your father. Mom, I'm sure Dad has a good reason for missing the science fair. He'd better. Better cool your jets, Mrs. J. Your heart rate and blood pressure are both elevated to dangerous levels. Rosie, it's only going to get more dangerous in here when George arrives. I'm home! Uh... Happy anniversary? I'll prepare the couch for you tonight, Mr. J. Valentine's day? I'll pack your bags for you, Mr. J. Please don't let it be your birthday. How many handles would you like on your casket, Mr. J? George, your son won second place for his project today at the science fair. Would have been first. Except that I've never actually made anything time travel. Although, Bobby Booster never made a volcano erupt. So I'm not sure why he got the blue ribbon. Ah, the whole thing's a popularity contest anyway. The science fair! Jane, Elroy, I'm so sorry. But I got a new assignment at work. And something big happened. Huge actually. Flying cars! Moving sidewalks. And jet packs! Wow! He's huge! Everybody, this is Big Show. Big Show, this is my wife Jane and my boy Elroy. Where's daughter Judy? Where else? Cheerleading practice. Welcome home, George. Is that a talking dog? George. Get this thing off me. Get your filthy hands off of Astro, you brute. Is that a talking robot? Take it easy, Astro. George, do something. You can let him go now, Big Show. George, see what happens when you bring your work home. I can't believe Mr. Saturnson giving us a history test the day before the big space ball game. Super un-cosmic. My head's so gonna be full of history there won't be room for the cheers. Oh. When are we ever gonna need to know 21st century history in real life, anyway? That does it! Rosie, stop with the robot kung fu. Big Show, please put my dog down. Now! Everybody listen. Big Show's been frozen in ice for 100 years. 100 years? I found him. Thawed him. And brought him home for dinner because he's a little freaked out about being in the future. How much dinner does it eat? Gee, Dad. That does explain everything. Come on, Big Show. You can sit next to me at the table. You have a lovely home. If that thing makes a mess on the carpet, I am not cleaning it up. Janey, I'm sorry I missed the science fair. You don't have to apologize to me. Really? Because the look you're giving me makes me think I do. George, if you want to put your work before the family, that's your decision. Oh, thanks, sweetie. That's a load off. So listen. I couldn't just leave Big Show at the office. But I promise, he'll stay just for one night. Tomorrow I'll figure out what to do with him. Really thought he's read between the lines on that one. I got the subtext, Mrs. J. And I'm a robot. Mmm. Oh! Nighty-night. Sleep tight. And just remember... I got my eye on you. Gotta... Get out of here. Good morning, Orbit City. It's another beautiful day in the troposphere. It's time to get up and get moving. Shake away those sleepy z's. Seriously, buddy. You're gonna be late. Get out of bed! I'm up! I'm up! Oh, Judy, sweetheart. You look exhausted. Let me make you breakfast. I was up all night cramming for my 21st century history exam. It's gonna be a disaster. I just know it. Maybe you should spend a little more time studying and a little less time cheerleading. What? So I can fail at cheerleading too? So uncosmic. Great advice, Mom. Well, that's what I'm here for. Good morning, to my two best girls. No time for breakfast. Gotta get to work and figure out this whole Big Show situation. Where is our sleepy ice man? Have you seen Elroy? Hey, Big Show. Rise and shine. - He's gone! - Elroy's not in his room. Where could they be? My Dad found him in a block of ice. He's from the 21st century. Ooh... Ooh... Is he a superhero? No. He's a... Uh... What exactly are you? You wanna know what I am? I'm the meanest, baddest warrior ever to enter the squared circle. Well, I mean, I was. Till I got frozen in ice. That championship belt was so close. I could taste it. You're going to taste a championship belt? Oh, I wasn't just going to taste it. I was gonna hold it over my head and scream, "I am the WWE "World Heavyweight Champion!" You're not the Heavyweight Champion. Reactor Rollins is. You telling me you got WWE in the future? - Of course. - In fact, there's a championship match this afternoon at Orbit City arena. That title belt is supposed to be mine! Reactor Rollins... You're going down! But Big Show, wait... Hey, taxi! To Orbit City arena. And step on it. I am only authorized to drive the designated speed limit. Just go! Big Show, stop! Elroy, is Big Show with you? Not anymore. That will be five billion star bucks. Not including tip. Here's your tip. Uh-oh. Dumb robot. Rollins! Huh? Attention! Our Superstars are very busy warming up. Information. Our event does not start for another two hours. I'm not here to watch it. I'm here to win it. Observation. You are human. Humans are not allowed in the ring. What? I thought this was the WWE. Affirmation. World Wrobot Entertainment. The W is silent. Robots? One, two, three. You are victorious once again, Reactor Rollins. It has been a pleasure grappling with you. Champ, the pleasure was all mine. Hey! You Reactor Rollins? Affirmative. You're wearing my championship belt. But not for long. Ow! Uh-oh. I just wanted to show him off to all my friends. It's not every day your Dad brings home an ice man. It's okay, son. I mean, how much trouble could one fellow get into? Projection. The boss is not going to like this. One, two, three. I am the champion! Actually, this battle was unsanctioned. Actually, lick my boot. Robots! You're an embarrassment to sports entertainment. Where I come from Superstars are made of blood, guts, and glory. They're warriors. Forged in the fire of battle. Not tin cans bashing each other like bumper cars. Hey, you're not supposed to be in there. This is robots only. Confession. Boss, I tried to stop him. Mr. McMahon? What are you doing in the future? McMoon's the name. Mr. McMoon. McMahon was my great, great, great, great... Well, you get the idea. Get that human out of my ring. Tick tock. Cosmic clock. Time's run out for you. Agreed. It is too bad for you that I am too good. Step aside, please. I will escort this large human from the ring. Come with me, please. Are you supposed to be me? And did you just say please, twice? You asked for It, large human. Oh, I'm not just large, I'm a giant! - Jumping Jupiter! - Annihilation! The human defeated our largest Superstar bot. Such moves do not exist in our database. We must update our combat program. No matter. When Superstars align, no human can stop us. This human's gonna teach you something new. You think Big Show is okay, Dad? Oh, I'm sure a fellow that size could take care of himself. It's a bolt bath in there. Tribulation. Indignation. Mortification! This is an outrage. You can't just barge in here and take over my robots. I just did. Verification. He did. Oh. Hey, Big Show. What's going on here? He thinks he's a WWE Superstar, Dad. But only robots can be Superstars. Wrong, kid. Superstars are supposed to be human. Not radio-controlled hunks of junk. Ah... Big Show. Now remember. This is the future. Robots do everything here. Right. What he said. Information. The police are on their way. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. No reason to involve the authorities. I'm sure we could work this out. You with all the muscles. Come quietly. Or we'll be forced to ask you to come quietly again. Great moons of Jupiter! Look at the size of it. Big Show, old buddy, old pal... Please, let's just settle down and talk this through. All right. Enough of this funny business. You're coming with me. Oh, you just made the biggest mistake of your life. Get him, boys! I am the WWE World Heavyweight Champion. You don't get me. I get you. Oh, boy. - Dad? - Way ahead of you, son. This is Rolf Rodriguez. Reporting live from Orbit City arena, where a riot has broken out between Orbit City security and a... A very, really, very big person. That's Big Show! Here's to another day of no surprises. I am here with the ring leader of this hullabaloo. Goes by the name, Big Show. Mr. Big Show, I have one question. Why? You future people make me sick. You allow robots to be your champions? Maybe you need a reminder of what a real champ can do. Starting right now. I'm not just gonna be the champion of the ring. I'm gonna be the champion of the world. And I'm gonna use your own robots to help me do it. You've heard it here first, folks. Big Show is planning to take over the world. For immediate reaction, we turn to Big Show's old buddy and old pal. What do you have to say about this, sir? What have I done? Jetson! Dad, shouldn't we help stop Big Show? I mean, this is kind of our fault. I think the authorities have it under control. Meanwhile, I think it's time for a Jetson family vacation. On Mars! Jetson, I expressly said, "No surprises." I'm sorry. George Jetson isn't here right now. I can see you! Please leave a message and he will return your call at his earliest convenience. Jetson, you're... Oops... Lost the connection. No telling where he was going with that sentence. Hey, Janey. Great news! I decided you were right. I'm done putting work before our family. So we're going on vacation. - Right now. - Daddy! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your friend Big Show is so cosmic. My friend? Judy... Why aren't you at school? My history class is canceled. My history test delayed. The whole school was sent home today 'cause Big Show's gone crazy, and is running wild in the city. Woo-hoo! Only my sister could find a reason to cheer for the apocalypse. Orbit City News Network brings you an update on the Big Show Rampage. - Uh-oh. - George Rodriguez, live from city hall, where Big Show and his gang of wrestling robots have taken over Orbit City. What did you do? For further comment, we go to Mayor Mercury. You'll never get away with this! Someone will stop you! No one can stop me. The future's full of wimps. You make an excellent point. Just as Orbit City fell to me, so too will the rest of the earth. From this point on, you will all do whatever I say, or you will face my robots! All hail, Big Show! All hail, Big Show. Hail hard, hail often! Kneel, for the new World Heavyweight Champion of the world! That's redundant. I said kneel! Ow! That makes one little falling star. Who will fall next? I am the greatest giant of all time! I hear Mars is beautiful this time of year. - Shall we? - George! What? How was I supposed to know he was an evil, power-hungry madman when I thawed him out? This is not my fault. Dad's right. This isn't his fault. It's not? If I hadn't taken Big Show to school, he never would have found out about Reactor Rollins, and none of this would have ever happened. Elroy, I am shocked! - George! - Seriously? Shocked that you would think this is your fault. None of us knew that Big Show would turn out to be a future-hating, robot-smashing monster determined to conquer the world as we know it. The point is, Elroy, you tried to befriend him, when it was clear he was lost. That makes you a bigger man than him. Yuck. Attention citizens of Orbit City. Oh, my. He's a handsome bucket of bolts. By order of world champion Big Show, everyone is to report to Time Warp Square for commencement of manual labor. Manual labor? Like a man? Doing the labor? At least there's no such thing as "Womanual labor." Right? Huh? You're not gonna last a day in the post-apocalypse. - Hmph! - Hmm. Humans working for robots. I've always wondered what that would be like. Just kiddin', you know I love ya. Ah, don't worry, everybody. We've worked too hard to have to work hard. Move it. Or you will lose it. Believe that. I think the coast is clear. Exit the apartment, and come with me. On my way, gorgeous. Uh, yeah, sure, be right there. Just have to use the bathroom. Might take a while. Had a big lunch. Follow me. I know exactly how to handle this. Exit the apartment, and come with me. Alas, my prince. 'Twas not meant to be. What now, Pops? If there's one thing I know, Elroy, it's when to flee for our lives! Mars, here we come! George Jetson, you turn this car around right now. You have to go talk Big Show out of conquering the world. - Me? - You thawed him out. You're the only one he might possibly listen to. Janey, I'm telling you, there's no one who can stop this guy. Wait, there is. Or there was. What are you talking about, Judy? Don't waste your time, Mom. Even she doesn't know what she's talking about. Hey! We've been studying the early 21st century in history class. Back then, humans like Big Show battled each other all the time. Are you saying WWE was people? Huge people, look, Big Show. And it says this man called Sheamus was his greatest rival. Too bad we don't have him to help bail your father out of this mess. What would you have me do, dear? Go back in time and ask for his help? - Actually, Dad... - I mean, you're talking time-travel. It's impossible. Dad, if you'd seen my science project... Yes, Elroy, I missed the science fair and I'm sorry. Why? Did you want to be bored out of your mind? My project hypothesized that utilizing the gravity well of a massive astronomical object could accelerate a spacecraft fast enough to breach the tachyon barrier of the space-time continuum. Flying around the moon will slingshot us back in time. Oh. Unauthorized space-car. You are ordered to land immediately. My prince. Couldn't keep away from me, could ya, handsome? Hold on, Jetsons! George! According to my calculations, just a little faster, Dad. I don't need a calculator to tell me that! If only I had a timeframe destination for my equation. Wow, it says here that Big Show was scheduled to battle Sheamus in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but he never appeared. He vanished from WWE exactly 100 years ago today. - What are the chances? - Cosmic. - Elroy, what are you... - I'm jacking the universal precisional system into the space-time de-modulator, reversing polarity, and setting it for exactly 100 years ago. Will that work, sweetie? - In theory. - We're dead. We're all dead. Floor it, Dad. We're alive! Welcome to Greenzone Parking, that'll be 40 bucks. Welcome to where? The timestamp on local internet channels confirms it. We just traveled 100 years into the past. - Into the when? - It worked! It worked! Eat that, Bobby Booster! My time travel theory worked. But how? Are we on the surface... Of the earth? Of the parking lot. 40 bucks, please. Look, that sign! We're at some kind of WWE event! Then this is where we'll find more big people. People who can stop Big Show. Well, all right, Jetsons. Maybe we have a shot at saving Orbit City, after all. Thanks to my boy, Elroy, and daughter, Judy. I'm very proud of you kids. - Thanks, Dad. - 40 bucks! Rosie, you stay here with the car and give this man what he needs. Oh, sure, Mr. J. I traveled back 100 years just so I could watch the car. You're a... A talking robot? Yeah, I came from the future to conquer your world. Boo! Primitive. Now let's find some Superstars that can help us. And keep an eye out for more like Big Show that can hurt us. All, right, Jetsons. Let's go. Why aren't we moving? I think the sllidewalk's broken. Now, hold on. Maybe it's just turned off. We just need to find the button. Slidewalks on, please. Hello? Are you there? I'm not sure what's wrong. I don't think they have slidewalks yet. Hey, get a load of those sci-fi costumes. That convention was last week, nerds. Well, I think you know what that means. We're walking. How much longer before they invent slidewalks? All this walking is killing my feet. Such an archaic society. How far have we gone? Car's okay! George, how will we get into this show if we don't have any tickets? Oh, not to worry, Janey, we'll sneak in the back door. Just like that theater I took you to on our first date. Oh, like you had to remind me. Hey, look over there. Hmm. Oh, that's Alicia Fox. She's a Superstar. That must be where all the Superstars enter the building. Ooh, chilly out here. Don't catch a cold, big guy. No, ma'am. Thank you, Miss Fox. Wow, they make Superstars that look like her? George! What I mean to say is, we just need to look like her. And then we can get in that door. Becky Lynch, Charlotte, Reigns, Kane. Hey, hey, hey. You're no Superstar. Who are you? I'm... Future Guy? Uh, yeah. We're escorting this hot new Superstar to the ring. By order of Mr. McMahon. Mr. McMahon? Oh, yes, ma'am, Miss Lynch. Come right in. Thanks, big guy. Oh, anytime, Miss Charlotte. She has always been my favorite Superstar. Are we backstage? Well, it's so dark in here, I can't tell. Didn't they have interior lighting 100 years ago? Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to WWE. Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah, awesome! Yeah. Whoa. - Ooh! - Ooh! * Fight the fight Give it all you got * With a hero's heart * Don't give up Give it all you got * With a hero's heart Oh, oh, oh * Got a hero's heart * Oh, oh, oh, oh * Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh * Fight the fight Give it all you got * Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Got to admit, Big Show was right. Robots just don't do WWE justice. I had no idea humans could be so... So physical. This is the most awesome thing I've ever seen! Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, WWE's got Superstars. Yay! Faugh a ballagh! There he is, Dad! It's Sheamus! Wow, he sure looks like a champion. A little on the pale side, but yeah. Oh, we are lined up for an exciting match here tonight, folks. With the number one contender, Big Show, still missing in action, we have a new contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Seth Rollins, the self-proclaimed future of WWE, has stepped up to prove he's just that. Still white as a ghost, huh, Sheamus? Good. 'Cause a ghost is all you're gonna be after I take that title away from you. Am I right, everybody? Uh-oh, that Seth guy looks dangerous. If he manages to hurt Sheamus, we'll lose our champ. Oh, my arm. It looks like the champ is getting the upper hand early in this match. - Sucker! - Huh? Oh, but it was all a devious plan by Rollins to lure Sheamus in for a suckerpunch. That's why they call him The Architect, folks. We have to get him out of there. Is there a button to stop the wrestling? No, Janey, no buttons. I'm just gonna have to go talk to Sheamus. - Ow! - George! Fine, I'm fine. Talking to Sheamus now. Let's go, Sheamus! Uh, excuse me, Mr. Sheamus. Can I have a word with you? Hey, you, get away from my title belt! Ha! This is unbelievable. A costumed fan jumped the barrier and is distracting Sheamus at ringside. He must be working for Seth Rollins. No, no, no, no, I'm trying to save the future. I need the champ. This guy's lost it. He's actually stealing the WWE World Heavyweight title. - Boo! That's not yours! - Hands off! You're gonna need two caskets, fella. 'Cause I'm gonna break you in half. Ha! Oh, thank heavens. The Uso Brothers and Alicia Fox are all headed to ringside, to take down this Superstar impostor. Uh-oh. It's absolute pandemonium here tonight. Mayhem inside the ring, chaos outside. I've never seen anything like it. Did Sheamus say he'd help us, dear? I think Dad's recruiting more help for us. Way to go, Pops! The trouble just doubled. Roman Reigns is here! Mr. Sheamus! Mr. Sheamus! Let's cut him off. Nobody escapes my lucky Cloverleaf hold. Mr. Sheamus, sorry. We kinda need your help to save the future. Get him! Unbelievable. The ring has erupted in absolute chaos! The ref has been tossed out of the ring. It's total anarchy! It's a schmuz! And it's about to get schmuzzier! WWE security is here. But what can he do to contain this madness? - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. Just when you thought it couldn't get crazier... It got crazier! One, two, three! - George! - Way to go! You did it, Pops! By me sainted mother. Who is that guy? - Huh? - Oh, George! - Yay! - We love you! Way to go! And the winner is, uh, what's your name, buddy? Future Guy! Future Guy! Future Guy? Future Guy? Hey, he can't have that name. I'm the undisputed future of WWE. * No chance * So that's what you all got? * Ladies and gentlemen, it's the boss! Mr. McMahon is here! Uh-oh. What's this all about? I've never even heard of this Future Guy. You got style, though, I'll give you that. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin your show. I was as surprised as you were. I don't like surprises, Future Guy. You're fired! Boy, that sounds familiar. No, no, please. It's Big Show. He's going crazy. He came to our city and took it over, and proclaimed himself to be the World Heavyweight Champion of the world! That's redundant. Wait, take him to my office. Now let me get this straight. You found Big Show frozen in ice, in the future? - Yes. - You thawed him out, - and he took over your city. - Yes. And you've come back in time to take my Superstars to the future to save... What was it? Onion Town? Orbit City, and yes. This is the craziest thing I've ever heard. I believe that. We found Future Guy's friends hiding out by the souvenir stand. Get your hands off me. Uh, did that dog just talk? I take it back. That is the craziest thing I've ever heard. Would you believe this isn't the first time I've met a talking dog? Okay, Future Guy. First, stop using "Future Guy" because everyone knows I'm the future of WWE, not you. Second, if you're really from the future, why don't you show us your flying car? Or your pet robot? Oh, great idea. They're both in the parking lot right now. They'll prove I'm telling the truth. But don't call Rosie a pet. She might be a robot, but she hates being called names. And she knows robot kung fu. Boss, you're not really considering this, are you? Hmm. I think I need to see this robot and spaceship you speak of. So, here they are. A spaceship. A pet robot. Ah! Watch your mouth. And the rest of you can shut your pie-holes before you start catching flies. Mr. J? I repaired the car while you were away. She's ready to fly. Well, Mr. McMahon? Do you believe us now? If Big Show really has taken over the future, and the Superstars of WWE are the only ones who can stop him, then, by gosh, we have to stop him. And I really wanna go for a ride in that spaceship. To the future! Yes! Bring me to Big Show, and I'll bring the fight. Shotgun! As the undisputed future of WWE, it's only fitting that I see my future, that I... Thank you, Rollins. Sheamus? Me versus Big Show in a match to decide the future of the earth. You can count me in, fella. George, you did it! You got them all to come with us. Yeah, but we aren't all gonna fit in your UFO. You got another spaceship parked around here? I've got something you're gonna like better. * Meet George Jetson * Mr. McMahon and Sheamus * Seth Rollins and the Usos * Alicia Fox and Roman Reigns * - Yahoo! - Yeah! Superstars in outer space. Fantastic. Oh, man. I cannot believe we are in space. I can't believe we're in the future. I can't believe you're all going to finally witness the future of my glorious WWE legacy. Nobody believes that. And you can believe that. Why I... Ow! Maybe try not standing up in the space-car. Everyone, welcome to... The future? Oh, George. He's brutalized our city! But how did he brutify it so fast? Oops. Looks like I miscalculated. We're back in the future, but about one month after we left. Look what he did to my school! Big Show did all this? This is what happens when you let Big Show do the decorating. First, we take down Big Show. Then we take down the decorations. Oh, can I take down his little statues? Sure, but who's gonna take down the big statue? Golly, Dad. I didn't think Big Show could get any bigger. Oh, no. Big Show's Superstar bots. Is that supposed to be me? 'Cause uh-uh, that tin can ain't got nothing on Miss Foxy. An Alicia bot? Uso bots? And I thought the originals looked lame. Hey! In your case, the bot is an improvement. Prepare to be processed for manual labor. Manual labor? I got your process right here, you trash can. Prepare to be scanned. Oh, me first, handsome. Sorry to disturb your meditation, your world championess, but there's something you should see. The Jetsons. Correct, the only humans to escape your supreme rule, thereby undermining your dominance, and making you look like a space clown. Catch them and put them in the Big Show City jail with the other troublemakers. Prepare for transport to Big Show City jail. Oh, boy. Hold on, gang. Why doesn't this thing have a button for escaping deadly robots? Deploy Big Show upgrades. Fire at will. - Dad? - I'm on it. - Dad! - All under control. George! I drive a lot better when people aren't yelling at me! Dad, we can't outrun them forever. This is getting out of control. How are we gonna get you guys to Big Show so you can defeat him? We're never going to get close to him with all those Superstar bots out there. We don't need to get close to him. I just need a way of calling him out. - Calling him out? - Challenging him. Big Show never backs down from a challenge. The bigger and louder you make it... The more it'll drive Big Show crazy. And then Big Show will come to us. What if we can get you on television? The Orbit City News Network station is nearby. Great idea, Mom. Yeah, that network reaches every TV screen on the planet. Uh, wonderful plan that will never happen, if we're already blasted out of existence by killer robots. Seth's right. Jane, if your plan is gonna work, I'm gonna need to get these bots off our tail. What are you going to do, George? - I'm switching to manual. - Oh! Everybody get ready to follow my lead! Way to go, Pops! Eat dust, you rust buckets! Do it again, George! I've got him. I've got him. - You missed him. - You missed him. Argh! - Faugh a ballagh! - Get me out of here. Move, move, move! False alarm, everybody. Woo. I feel much better now that I'm out of that space capsule. George! Huh... I hope Dad is going to be okay. Don't you worry, lad. Your pa looks to be a very brave warrior. And if there's one thing your father knows about getting into trouble, it's how to sneak his way out of it. Well, that may be true, but since you all have Big Show covered, I want to make sure our friend George is covered. Then you're going to need a guide for the future so you don't get lost or dead. Come on, Mr. M. Robot motorcycle. Now we're talking! Hang in there, Roy boy. We'll bring your dad back. Let's save George. You said it, Astro. Can't catch me, lame bots. We are not lame. It is you who is lame. Miss Foxy bot is going to get you. Foxy bot! Foxy bot! The path to your surrender is written in the stars. You cannot. You will not escape. Give up or you will face the wrath of Big Show. Trust me, you don't want none of that. Okay, I surrender. Nighty nightmares. Ha ha ha ha. Another puny human falls to Big Show world champion of the world. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Boy, I hope this works. Okay, everybody. Let's go. Ya-hoo! And on the lighter side, look at this puppy! It almost makes you forget that we're all enslaved by a madman. Hey! You cannot be in here. Excuse us, Rolf. We've got breaking news. - But you can't... - Emphasis on the breaking. Well, when you put it that way. We interrupt this puppy to bring you a special report. Ready for your close up, Sheamus. Time to call out Big Show. Big Show! I've come a long way to find you, fella. Sheamus? He's here? Imagine my surprise when I found out you've been hiding in a glacier for 100 years all because you were too chicken to step in the ring with me. So, now you've taken over the future with no Sheamus and declared yourself the world champ. Well, surprise, Big Show! The real champ is here. And in front of the millions of people watching this all over the world. I'm calling you out. Anytime, anyplace, I will run you into the ground. - He can't hear you, sir. - What? That's a TV screen, not a video phone. - Argh! - Ow. Looks like we have a caller. Time Warp Square, 10 minutes! I'll be there. - My turn to be on TV. - Seth. It is a Rolf Rodriguez's exclusive, a grudge match. 100 years in the making. Two humans, battling it out for total supremacy. And I will be there, bringing you every heart-pounding second or my name isn't Rolf Rodriguez! Feels like I've been in here forever. - Jetson? - Mr. Spacely? Oh, this is just great. Stuck in a cell with Jetson. You know, this is all your fault! Yes sir, I'm well aware. But don't worry. I've got a plan to take Big Show down. - You see my family was... - You sent your family to deal with that madman? Huh, classic Jetson. Big Show will destroy them. If I was your family, I'd fire you so hard right now. But they have help. Went back in time and found real WWE Superstars that know how to stop Big Show. It doesn't matter. Big Show is too powerful. He has all my Superstar bots under control. As well as his new destruction bots. If anyone tries to stop him, they'll fail. Time for a cosmic awakening. It is written in the stars. We will hit hard. And hit often. Oh, what's going on? Everyone is going to Time Warp square. World champion Big Show and his destruction bots are about to spring a trap on some puny humans from the past. A trap! Oh, no! My family is heading into a trap and they don't even know it. We need to get out of here. We need to help them. What can we do? We're just people. - People can't do anything. - That's right. The robots took our buttons away. You're wrong. Our ancestors used to do everything. They cooked for themselves. They cleaned for themselves. They even walked everywhere. We live in a future so great, we don't have to do anything. And if we want to get back to doing nothing, today we have to do something. What can we do? We're stuck in this cell. Another stinker of an idea from Jetson. Trust me. I work with this guy. He's got a million of them. Wow! For a second there I thought he was gonna do it. Classic Jetson! Huh! I did it! Don't worry, Mr. J, it'll be our secret. Let's get you out of here, George. Yeah. Thanks, Rosie. Thank, Mr. McMahon. Hey, fellas! Who wants to help me save the future? Well, technically, it's the present. Who wants to help me save the present? Guess Big Show is right. The future really is full of wimps. You think he's going to show? If he doesn't, he'll have to rename himself No Show. - No Show! - Yeah. What the devil? It's a trap! - Hey! - Let go. I just need to call him out. He'll come right to us. We wouldn't be in this mess if The Architect had done the planning. The Architect better start planning for a full body cast if he keeps mouthing off. I can... I will break you, robot. You cannot. You will not. - Can! - Cannot. Will, and you can believe that. I will not believe that. Sheamus! You came a long way to taste my boot. The only thing I'm gonna be tasting is victory. Big talk from a little man. But to earn your match with me you must first survive my Undertaker bot. My Kane bot. I call them my Bots of Destruction. Excellent plan, Your Excellency. The Architect could have done better. I'm warning you. Two on one. You can't beat me alone, huh, fella? I'm in charge. I make the rules. Well, I'm here to break your rules and your bots. Destruction Bots, destroy Sheamus! Let's go, Sheamus! - Way to go, Sheamus! - Go Sheamus, woo-hoo! Whoa! You are supposed to be in your cell. Yeah? Well, so are we. We may be wimps, but there's a lot of us. Uh-oh! Yeah, you're in for it now, sprocket head. Time to lead a revolution, Future Guy. Charge! Uh-oh! This is so wrong. Uh-oh, uh-oh. Whoa, there! This futuristic billboard bucks like a bull. You bots should come to Ireland and try our famous potatoes. Let me give you a sample. One potato, two potato, three potato, four. Bring it on, fellas. There's a whole lot more! Woo-hoo. - Oh, my! - Yay, you got him. Oh, please! All the four-leaf clover in the world won't bring him the luck he needs to win. Ugh! That does it. When I get out of this, you're so gonna get it. They call this guy the Celtic warrior? More like Celtic Bore-ior. Seriously! This guy is boring me to death. Come on, Sheamus! Tag me in. Let me show you how a real champion does it. I'll tag you in, you runt! Ha! The Architect outsmarts everyone again. Kane bot, destroy Seth Rollins. Whoa! Hey! Oh, I like these odds. Bring it on. You're a strong one, but you got no soul. You got no heart. So, let me show you a proper heartbeat. Now it's my turn to party. Whoa! Hey! Help! Ah! There can be only one Roman Reigns. - Time to get... - Uso crazy. - U! - So! Bots, get Seth Rollins. - Oh! - As you command, your world championess. Rest in pieces. Doesn't matter what century it is. I've always been better than you. I'm not gonna pin you. I want you to kneel before your champion. Don't do it, Sheamus! - Don't give in. - You can take him. Give him the what for! Prepare to silence the Jetsons. Sheamus bot. Don't surrender, Sheamus. He's nothing but a great big bully. Ah! No! You wouldn't. Kneel. Huh? And that, as they say, - is how you layeth the smacketh down. - George! - Dad! - Daddy. Thank Jupiter you're all okay. Okay, everybody. Time to take back our city. You're not going anywhere, Big Show. We want our city back. Yeah, this is our home and don't you forget it. - Now you're the one in a cage. - You stink! At last, just you and me, fella! Saw that coming a mile away. But did you see this coming, little bug? Windshield bug. I see what you did there. Now you got me Irish up. - Get him. - Go Sheamus! Help! Anybody. Ow! Ow! Uh-oh! Miss Foxy is on fire today. Yay Alicia! Woo-hoo! So, you want to see me fly, robot? I'll show you some flying. Superman Punch! Never fails. Ooh, waa! Yeah! That's what you get for picking on a kid. I should have taken that job as a toaster. Uso! I saved all of you guys. And that's why I am the future of WWE. You may all thank me... Told you I'd get you. And thank you, Seth. You're welcome. Ballagh! Hi-ya! The Celtic warrior falls to no man. No beast. Nor Big Show. Oh. Whoa! Oh! Sheamus! Looks like you fall to me after all. Hang on, Sheamus! - Going up. - George! Jetson! - Here they come. - Dad's bringing them back. But it's not over yet. Looks like Big Show is winning. You will fall. Everyone falls to me. I am Big Show. I am the champion. - What? - What's that, fella? I can't hear you over my white noise. - Yay! - Yay, Sheamus! - Go! Go! - Let's go, Sheamus! Let's go, Sheamus! Let's go, Sheamus! Still can't hear you, friend. Try talking into my throw kick. One, two! But you had the three count. You had me beat. Why? Let's go back to our time, fella. Let's battle like true Superstars in a proper ring. Then we'll see once and for all who deserves to be WWE World Heavyweight Champ. Okay. But we all know it's gonna be me, right? Did you see that? Humans in action. It was amazing! You look ridiculous. You know that? That should do it. I programmed the car to take you guys back to the night you left. I figured that would cause the least number of temporal paradoxes. Ah, listen guys. Thanks so much for helping us out. We really appreciate it. Big Show! Don't you have something you want to say? George, I owe you and your family an apology. Especially you, Elroy. You also owe me a new teddy bear. Settle for my Bots of Destruction? Hmm. Deal. I owe the rest of you an apology too. I don't know if it was being frozen in ice for 100 years or... Beating a robot for the championship title. But I crossed a line and I'm sorry. I hope you can forgive me. But you enslaved us! And made us build a giant statue. Yeah. What about that? Who's gonna fix our city? We should probably get going. Right behind you. Farewell, Jetsons. - Jetson! - Mr. Spacely. I know. I should have told you about Big Show the second I found him. I understand if you never want me to work for you again. Are you kidding? I just got the contract to rebuild Orbit City. I'm gonna need to promote somebody to supervise the robots while they do all the work. You think you can handle it? A promotion? Yes, sir. Mr. Spacely, sir. I'm your man but first I'm gonna need a week off to spend with my family. - I'll give you one day... - I'll take it. Oh, George! I'm so proud of you. Me too! Oh, stop. Okay boy, that's enough. Seriously, this is getting kinda gross. I sure hope those guys made it back okay. I love these classic matches. I could watch them a thousand times. And you have. Good news! I aced my history test. My teacher said I knew more about the 21st century than he did. Guys, we gotta get going. We're gonna be late for WrestleMania. Oh, you're right! And the World Champion is... Everybody in the car. Hey, wait for me! Salutations, Jetsons. Oh! Short but cute. Notification. Ha! We have your space box all ready for you. A space box? Appreciation. It is the least we can do. After all, tonight is all because of the Jetsons. Ladies and gentlemen, to honor the brave human Superstars who saved Orbit City. To inspire a new generation to get off their buttons and reach for the stars, WWE will now and forever more be for humans only. Better them then us. Totally agree. Please welcome to the ring your new WWE Superstars! I got my Superstars right here. - Thanks, Dad. - Aw!
