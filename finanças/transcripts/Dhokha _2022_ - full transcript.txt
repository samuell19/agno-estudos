Happy birthday! Surprise! What did your lawyer say? What did your lawyer say? How many times do I have to tell you? It's been three months. I am not waiting anymore. I want a divorce, Yathaarth! Look, I need to know what your bloody lawyer says, by this evening. By "this" evening! I have applied for a UK visa. I need an answer by today evening. Say "yes" dammit! Yes. Bloody asshole. Hey, Siri. Call Psychiatrist Vidya. Hello. - How are you? - How do you think I am? I face the same old drama every day, Vidya. I'm beginning to lose my patience now. Just relax. You'll have to be patient. It's only a matter of time, and everything will be fine soon. How will things be fine? My life has become hell after that incident which happened to you. I don't know what to do. I know. Come and see me today. I'll try. Listen, I'll call you from the office, okay? Okay. Take care. Bye. Hi! - Morning, sir. - Morning. Sir. Mr. Arvind has called you to his cabin. - Okay. - Okay, sir. Hi, Arvind. My golden boy! Looks like we cracked it. Neonext likes us. Did they agree to the deal? Almost. Next week, you and I have to go to Singapore, for a final presentation. We need to give the client's ego a little massage. And post that… Some Nuru massage for us. Take Bose with you, sir. I can't make it. What happened? You know, the usual stuff. This is your moment of fame. You worked so hard for it. This is your pitch. - You need to be there. - Yeah, I know, sir. But the client has accepted our deal. So, you guys go have fun. The client's not accepted our deal. But, sir, you just said... We say such things to motivate the team. Come. Sit. Yathaarth, I know this has been going on in your life for some time now. And I don't see this ending very soon. You have some personal problems. I have medical problems. The show must go on. If you don't think about the company, then the company will have to think about themselves. This building in Mazgaon locality is where terrorist Haq Gul is hiding out! As per the sources he snatched the gun from the police who were transferring him from Arthur Road jail to Yerwada jail. The police aren't revealing much. But the police are getting the people evacuated from the building. As you all know, Haq Gul was sentenced to death by the court, in connection to the boy's hostel blast case. Sorry. What's going on? Sir, Haq Gul. Haq Gul, sir. The main accused in the Byculla college blast. Police arrested him six months ago. He's escaped. It's all over the news. A terrorist who killed 13 innocent students in ten minutes, has been hiding out in this building for the past 30 minutes. Hey, Siri. Call wife. - The number you've dialed… - Shit! Hey, Siri. Call Psychiatrist Vidya. - Hello. - Vidya, turn on the TV! Check out the news. I'll call you later. Okay. Heavy forces have been deployed at Spring Shine building. The police have set up their command center. The entire compound has turned into a war zone. Out of my way! Haq Gul is hiding on the third floor in flat number 301 of Spring Shine Building. Stay with us for further updates. Excuse me, sir. Move aside. - Wait a minute. - Listen, mister. Sir, that's my house. - That's my house. - Your house? Yes, Yathaarth Sinha. - Yathaarth Sinha? - Yes. - Hello, Mane speaking. - Yes. Tell me. A man called Yathaarth Sinha claims that he's the owner of the house. - What do I do? - Send him in. Sir, you may please go. Take him inside. No, sir. Everyone's engrossed in their mobile phones! -If only you'd done your job, -Sorry, sir. This would've never happened! - Sorry, sir. - Come with me. Sir, listen to me. Don't you know it's prohibited to come in here. - This way, sir, come. - Live reporting, sir. - You need to stay alive to report live. - How did the terrorist get into the society? - Please tell us, sir. - Come on, move! - Get out. Come on. - Sir, we are live on TV. Why are you pushing us? Sir! - Tell them to tighten the outer perimeter. - Yes, sir. Sir. That's his flat. ACP Harichander Malik. Yathaarth Sinha. Sir, that's my home. Can I go upstairs? I am sorry, sir. It's a crime scene. Come here. - Sir… - Please, sit. Don't panic. We're in control of the situation. Where are you from? Who's usually in the house at this hour? I don't have my family here. I just have my wife, Saanchi and she's from Delhi. And a maid who stays with us 24/7. The guard says that your maid stepped out of the house, nearly an hour ago and didn't return. This means Saanchi is alone in the house. Sir, I must go in. She's not alone in the house. There's a well-trained terrorist with her, and he's got a loaded nine mm gun. Believe me, sir. He is very dangerous. Get up. I'll not repeat, madam. Get up. Water. Water! Is there anyone else at home? No. Pour it. Sit. Mr. Malik! Hey, Malik! I am holding a mini AK 47. If you try to trick me… Then you will lose this girl. - Do you get it? - Sir! Gul. It's better if you surrender. If we come up… Then you won't be spared. You bloody… Come here. Come on. - Malik. - Saanchi! - Stop him. - I've been sentenced to death. That won't change if I kill another person. - Saanchi… - If the mortuary van arrives, then she will go with me. Do you get it? Gul, don't give me a hard time. It's better that… You surrender yourself and return my gun. You'll get a bullet instead of a gun. Call Jibran here. You have one hour. Only one hour! Rascal, Jibran has been on the run for six months! You know that! I know it! You've hidden Jibran somewhere! Call him here right now! Understood? - Come on, please. - Just a second. Listen to me. Saanchi! He's annoying me now! How do we find Jibran now? Sit down. Relax. He can shoot her! Why is he talking to him so rudely? It's okay. Sir, why are you talking so rudely to him? He's not Ajay Devgn from Diljale, who will agree to my terms if I speak politely! And surrender himself! I broke nine bones in the interrogation, and that's when he spoke up! Hey, take it. Kasab part two? Pakistan sends a new agent of terror! The nation wants to know… Until when will this continue? Haq Gul is one of those youngsters, who treats terrorism as a business. There was a Gul and then there was a Bulbul. The Mumbai Police is lying! Watch our exclusive report. Haq Gul snatched an AK 47 from the police while escaping! These people should be called the terrorists! What are you looking at, madam? This is not an AK 47… But a single bullet can easily kill you. Can you kill me? If you can kill me, then go ahead. I see! First, you can get whatever you want from them, and then you can kill me. But please, will you kill me? Were you waiting for me to show up? Why are you so eager to die? Does this look like a prank to you? Tell me. Have you ever had a scratch on your body? Do you know the pain of death? The pain of death? I feel it every day. Every day! He kills me every day. My husband. If you kill me… Then that will be the end of my troubles. Sir, the QRT and ATS have arrived at the spot. The police aren't allowing us to record live. But our reporters are on the spot. Coverage is up to the mark. Banerjee, what's going on? Are we going to run with this reporting? Will we show them the truth? Put some angle into it, man. What's going on here? Sir, LTV is running the patriotic angle. And TV69 is showing the public safety angle. Then show the terrorist's human angle. Make him a victim of Kashmir Police, and get statements from a couple of our leftist politicians! Create some controversy! What kind of Bengali are you? Do I have to teach you now? Sir, the public will troll us on social media. Then run the hostage girl's angle. Do some family drama terrorism! I don't care. I need some drama and some emotion in this fucking story. How long? - Five minutes, sir. - Make it two minutes! And give me some fancy name for the terrorist. My wife is all alone with that man. Her name is Saanchi. Mr. Malik, please listen to me. - Please listen to me. - I asked you to sit down. - Mr. Malik. - I told you to sit down. Sit down! Sir, I must tell you something important. Please, listen to what I am saying. Why don't you understand? One wrong step can get your wife killed. Understand? If I don't go upstairs on time, they can both end up dead. What? Sir, the woman with that man, who do you think is a middle-class, simple, educated housewife… Is a patient of delusional disorder! And she's in the advanced stages. Sir, she's mentally very ill, and extremely volatile. By volatile you mean… What is she capable of doing? She can imagine things that don't exist. I mean, for her reality is… For example, this morning we had a heated argument. She said that I haven't signed the divorce papers for three months. But we never had a topic of divorce. Sir, she thinks her psychiatrist, Vidya to be my girlfriend. And she argues with me every day. I called Vidya. Actually, why don't you talk to her? Maybe she'll be able to tell you how to handle this better. Sir, it's more complicated than it looks. I must go up, sir. He's made his own girlfriend as my psychiatrist. And they want to prove that I am crazy. You tell me. Your name's Gul, right? You know, the meaning of Gul is, flower. My name is Saanchi. So, tell me, Gul… Do I look crazy to you? Why is he doing this? Why doesn't he divorce you? If he divorces me, he cannot get my property and money. He'll have to bid goodbye to it. And if he proves I'm mentally ill, he'll send me to an asylum and become my caretaker - Madam… - and then... I don't want to hear this husband-wife saga. My own life is a complete mess. - I'm telling the truth. - Quiet! And how long has she been suffering from it? It's been some months. Which hospital are you affiliated with, ma'am? DD Care Hospital. You know what, - give your details to my subordinate. - Okay, sir. Note down her details. Okay, sir. - Hello. - Yashodha, what took you so long? How could you leave the door open? Sir, I was at the market. Ma'am gave me a list of things to buy. And, why will I leave the door open, sir? - I have the keys. - Yes. Sir, she is Yashodha. I was talking about her. You can ask her about Vidya, the pills, and also about the mental disease. How long have you been working for them? It's been a year, sir. And sir, it's time for ma'am's pill. Oh, God! What pill? The pill subscribed by the doctor which Saanchi always refused to take. We would always tuck them into something, and give her the pill on time. But I guess it's almost time now. Yes, sir. And we're never late. If we're late, then… Then? Anything can happen. Anything can happen. Hello. Jai Hind, sir! What's going on, commissioner? Haq Gul hasn't been apprehended yet. The QRT and Mumbai police are at the crime scene. I am sending the NSG team from Delhi. Sir, my best officer and his team is on the case. Isn't he the same officer who let Haq Gul escape? He's the one who nabbed him. He'll nab him again. NSG is waiting for a call. How do I tackle the Home Minister? Sir, please tell him to give us just two hours. Two hours, sir. Malik! He is calling… He is calling out to you guys. Call Malik! Malik, what's the status of Jibran? Get Jibran in a car. And if the car's tires are deflated, then she will not be spared. - Who is Jibran? - I told you that we don't have him. Don't you get it? Don't joke with me! Get back. What's wrong? Are you scared? Call Jibran right now! Sir. - Jai Hind, sir! - What is the status? The central government is forcing me to send NSG. Sir, the force is already here, and all for a single terrorist. And getting more force can get Gul angry. How do I deal with the home minister's secretary? He's getting angry at me. Sir, tell him that the situation is already chaotic! And that he shouldn't involve politics in it! Everything is politics, Malik. We have only two hours. Sir, this is not some film, where the villain will die after two hours. And the audience will applaud it. If you want to be the hero… Then you have only two hours. Once the NSG arrives… Then you also won't be spared so easily. All the best. We've Mrs. Makhani with us. She's the best friend of the hostage family. How long have you known Mr. and Mrs. Sinha? Saanchi… Such a lovely girl. She used to have a lot of mood swings. But my Ying Yang Spa at Kemps Corner… Would fix her mood in a jiffy. So sad to hear she's no more. Her husband Yathaarth… Such a sweet loving boy. I don't know how he will endure this pain. People are so terrorized by Haq Gul that many have assumed that Saanchi is dead. Mumbai is praying for Saanchi Sinha. Go ahead and add a hashtag #SaveSaanchi if you want to see Saanchi and Yathaarth Sinha together again. Over to studio. You rich people… When we look at your house and your cars from the outside… It looks like you have everything. But the truth is… You have nothing but your homes and your cars. Just defeat. Don't you have any siblings? Parents? Don't they know your story? There's a story. Do you want to hear it? No. Once truth and lie were going somewhere. Lie said, "let's go take a bath". They both climbed down a well to take a dip. As soon as truth dove in… The lie made off with all his clothes. And since that day, lie has been roaming the planet dressed as truth. The entire world believes that my husband is telling the truth. And I am still trying to prove myself right to the world. Gul. Pick up the land line! Now! - Yes. - Hello. Mister, my name is Yathaarth Sinha, and I am Saanchi's husband. Please don't hang up. What I am about to say is very important. My wife's condition is pretty serious. She is mentally unstable. And it's time for Saanchi to take her pills. She must be given these pills every four hours. And Saanchi will never take these pills willingly. We used to give her these pills tucked in her food. And these pills are in a bottle hidden behind the switchboard, in the bathroom of our bedroom. Brother… please give her these pills. Otherwise, her condition will get worse, and she can be a threat to all of us and not just herself. Listen. When God created human beings… He whispered one thing in everyone's ears. "You're the smartest human being." So, tell Malik to stop trying these tricks, and send Jibran over. If he thinks the police can get in using these excuses, then he's just a kid. A small kid. Brother, listen to me. I am not joking. Jibran and a car. - Was that my husband? - No. What was he saying? - He was telling you to give me the pills. - Sit down. Where did he hide those pills? Which pills? You don't know about it, Gul. It's all about the pills. Those pills are given to me… Just to drive me crazy. He didn't say anything about any pills. I behave weirdly after taking those pills. And that's what Yathaarth wants. Please think. Why would anyone make excuses to give me the pills which are meant to cure me? Those pills are given to me to drive me crazy. Can I say something? This city isn't inhabited by humans. It's filled with imposters! Bloody idiots! I am not an imposter, Gul. Try me. You and I are alike. Make some tea. Did someone break your trust? Make some tea. Come on. Two cups of tea. One for you and one for me. It's because you'll drink everything you make for me. I don't think he can give the pills to Saanchi. Be frank with me, sir. Who is Jibran? And is he in your custody? Jibran is at large. Never heard a cop telling the truth? What do we do now, sir? You must have a clue… As to how much time we have if your wife isn't given the pills? I've no clue, sir. Sometimes she's stable for a couple of hours, and sometimes she loses in ten minutes. A couple of days ago, we were at Vidya's office. I had given her the pills. Everything was fine. And, suddenly… I think even the song O Ha seen a Zulfonwali, and… Which one was that? How do I know? That one, yeah. Oh, mere Sona re. It's easily one of my favorite films. I agree. Tell me. What about romantic films? I don't have a favorite. There is one. That DVD we've had for the longest time. - Which one? - That Tamil... Ek Duje K Liye. - Oh, that's my favorite as well. - Really? Hey, is it Saanchi's favorite or yours? I don't have any favorites. - It's never... - I think it's your favorite. You also seem like that Kamal Hassan type. All intellectual and calm. Whatever. Do you think he's Kamal Hassan? I... Anyway, let's talk about something else. And who are you? - Rati Agnihotri? - Saanchi, I... Saanchi, she didn't mean it like that. Please don't touch me. What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Calm down. I didn't mean it. Others husbands look like heroes to you, bitch? Please take it easy. Favorite love story. - See the mood swings. - What do you want to do? Do you want to romance him? - Saanchi, please take it easy. - Sing songs with him. Bloody bitch! - Please can you calm down? - Calm down, Saanchi. - Calm down. - Oh, just shut up! She's giving everything you want, right? You're enjoying yourself with her. - Saanchi, please listen to me. - And you… You bloody slut! - What are you doing, Saanchi? - Just shut up. Don't you dare touch me! How dare you! What's wrong with you? How dare you! And since that day, she thinks Vidya is my girlfriend… And I am cheating on her. Sir, please… Thank you. On some days she sets out in the middle of the night, with a knife to murder Vidya. And on other days she screams to accuse me. She claims that I'm using my office trips as an excuse, to sleep with Vidya. Sir, she turns all her narratives into reality as per her whims and fancies. And then it doesn't matter what the truth is. It's hard to say who amongst the two are more dangerous. Can I ask a question? Only two people look nice asking questions. Children and only children! Sense of humor. Why did you say that this city's filled with imposters? Fine, don't tell me. I know that it's true. I would've… Never come to know… If I hadn't come home early the other day coincidentally. Saanchi, it's good you're home. What the hell? Dr. Vidya was here to meet you. Well… I was passing by and thought I'll drop by. But since you weren't at home, - so, poor Yatharth had to make tea. - Yes. Clumsy me, I dropped the tea. So, we just came inside to clean it up. Are you okay? There are no teacups in the living room, you bitch! Hey, take it easy. I just washed them. Where is Yashoda, Yathaarth? I am sure you've got an explanation for that. I don't need to give you an explanation. You should know it's Tuesday. She's gone to the temple. She went out, and you called this bitch home. What's wrong with... I am really sorry, doctor. And you? Sleeping with my husband in my bedroom, you bitch! What's wrong with you? Are you okay? Vidya! Have you lost your mind? I did everything… for that lowlife. She was in my bed, Gul. He was fucking her in my bed. That's how the world is, ma'am. Don't believe strangers. And never trust your kin. My uncle was like family. Baramulla. He got me shelter and food. And I considered him an angel. One day he called and told me that he found a job for me in Mumbai. And I came over. It was a new city for me with new people. The place was swarming with people, but none I could call kin. On my uncle's recommendation, I got a place to stay on Mohammad Ali Road… And two friends. Things were going pretty smooth. It was a courier's job. Didn't have to rack my brains. Collect the parcel from one place, and deliver to other. And another to some other place. I was very happy. Come over next week. My employers require more people. The pay is good. I am calling from my phone. I also watch movies on it. All good out there? Goodbye, brother. Like every other day, I was given a parcel on that day as well. Deliver it to this address. That's all for today. I had to deliver it to the boy's hostel. And I did it. The other day there was a blast at the boy's hostel of Sanjeevan college. I delivered the courier. My signature was on it. So I was claimed to be a terrorist. Uncle denied everything. He said that he doesn't know the courier guy. A tragedy has occurred, on the second floor of Sanjeevan College's boys' hostel. There's been a bomb blast. ATS, forensics, and ACP Chandra Malik's team have arrived at the spot, and are conducting their investigation. Sir, how many died in the incident? Around 13 children lost their lives, and 20 more are wounded. What have we done? What have we done? The police kept torturing me for 20 days. Finally, my truth and I… Were buried in the depths of prison. Our kins have betrayed us. But I believe you. I know you're telling the truth. Cup. It's… empty. I'll keep it. I won't spare these rascals! Malik, I want 50 lakh rupees along with Jibran! 50 lakh rupees! If this amount is worth more than someone's life for your government, then ask her husband to get the money. 50 lakh rupees! You have only two hours. Jibran and 50 lakh rupees! Otherwise, she will be dead. I will kill her! Understood! He's showing his true colors now. He wants five million. - Sawant. - Yes, sir. Any news about Jibran? No, sir. Come on, guys! Let's crack this now! We will not negotiate further! Understood? - Yes, sir! - Hurry up. Mr. Malik… He's asking for money… And I think this means that he wants to leave. If he gets the money… He will let Saanchi go, sir. He won't harm her! Forget Jibran, and forget the government. I'll arrange for the money. Mr. Sinha. I can understand your condition. At the moment, your wife's condition, our luck, and that scoundrel's nature, are not in our favor. - Why? - But if you think you'll go in and he'll happily let your wife go… Then you're wrong. He killed 13 boys. In his right frame of mind, he took 13 innocent lives. Around a year ago, a boy from Kashmir came to Sanjeevan college to study. Some of the boys called him a terrorist while ragging him. The poor boy was innocent. He committed suicide. It was an unfortunate incident. But for psychos like Haq Gul… It's like an opportunity. Do you know what you're going to do? Yes, sir. I am going to do justice! Justice for whom? For the innocent, who are being targets of hatred! He was trained by Lashkar. He was brainwashed, and sent straight to Mumbai! He built a strong setup. He rented a place in Mumbai with his accomplices. He used his courier job… And started collecting materials from different places to build a bomb so that no one ever doubts him. - Eventually, he got rid of all evidence. - Okay, sir. His plan was foolproof. From beginning to end, he did everything on his own. A single man with many talents. He built a bomb himself, and planted the bomb in the hostel. Look at his guts. Thank God that… The guard recognized his face. Otherwise, he would've slipped through our hands. Slow down. - Take turns, please. - Sir, who is behind this bomb blast? Do you have any clue? Our sources don't have any information yet. But we'll inform you as soon as we find out. How many have died, sir? About 13 boys are dead, and 20 more are injured. Tell us! How did he look? Sir… he had a long face. He had stubble. He had a thick mustache. What about his eyes? He had brown eyes. He had brown eyes, sir. He had a scar on his forehead. Exactly like this. He had a mark over here. The police prepared his sketch. When he, along with his five accomplices, were trying to escape… MAHARASHTRA POLICE we arrested them from their home on Mohammad Ali road. A guy called Iqbal will give you your ticket. You and I will stay here. The blast in Sanjeevan College's boy's hostel has been taken care of. But we've no information about our next target. Don't move! Freeze! Come with us! Seize everything! There's nothing you can do. I will deal with everything. He's well-trained in arms and combat. He won't miss it under any circumstances. - Sir, tea. - Yes. Sir. - No, thank you. - Please have. It will help you relax. Thank you. What happened, Gul? You're not a terrorist, but you do have a gun. Then why are you scared? Has no one ever been so close to you before? There must be someone back home… Who you are close to. Or have you never felt… What's it like to be close to someone? I am with you. I am with you. Gul, what's going on? I want evidence that the hostage is safe. Otherwise, I'll be forced to give fire-at-will orders. - Sawant, call now. - Yes, sir. Gul, answer Mrs. Sinha's phone right now! Here you go, sir. Hello. Four hours! Haq Gul has been giving the Mumbai Police a run for their money for four hours. But NSG hasn't made it to Mumbai yet. Why? The nation wants to know! Who is stopping NSG from coming to Mumbai? What is the politics behind it? Type #IndiawantsGul and send your texts to 9-5-9-5. Cut it! The hostage claims she is fine. It was an accidental fire. Thank God. What happened, sir? She's fine. Don't worry. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! What are you thinking, Gul? Is it that… This isn't what you planned on doing? Tell me, Haq. You used to talk to me when you came here. Now you don't speak at all. Can I get some water? - Water? - How can I get it so easily? I've grown used to it now. Say just like you used to. Get up! Get up. Will you run away with me? Really? Will you take me with you? Of course. Will you never abandon me, Gul? Be with me forever! I swear on God. Let's go right now. - Right now? - Yes. You know what? Point an empty gun at my head… And take me downstairs. Only you and I would know that the gun is empty. I'll be with you. I'll stick to you like glue. So, no one will fire either. I have a car. We'll go to your village… Or to whatever place you like. A place where we can breathe freely. If you don't trust me… Then you can point your loaded gun at my head. Maybe that's when you will trust me. There's no outcome yet in the Mazgaon hostage case. News channels are busy gathering TRPs, and local parties are busy gathering sympathy. And the central government is trying to pinpoint the Maharashtra Government by sending NSG. But no one's thinking about Saanchi Sinha. No one's worried about her. No one knows the ordeal she's going through. Sir, I think I saw a movement. Malik! - Is it planned? - Malik! - Tell me quickly. - Sir, look! That rascal's lost his mind! Team, come on! Malik! - Saanchi. - Sir. - Stay back. - No one will come here. Just stay where you are! And tell them to put their guns down. Put your guns down! Right now. If you try to act smart… Then I will blow her brain out! - Saanchi! - Come on, make way. You've already created a ruckus. Don't make it worse. Jibran is on his way, and your money is ready. I don't want anything. Come on, open the gate. I will take madam with me in her car. And no one will follow me. Understood! Come on. Gul. Open the gate. His gun is empty! How dare you betray me?! - I will slit her throat. - Shoot him. How dare you double-cross me?! You're so unfaithful! We witnessed the most unbelievable scene at Spring Shine building at Mumbai's Mazgaon locality just a while ago. Hostage Saanchi Sinha was alive, and unharmed when terrorist Haq Gul brought her out. But her safety has now become a grave concern. - Hello. - What's going on, commissioner? I cannot stop the NSG from coming to Mumbai. Sir, we've already deployed our force. Please! It won't reflect well on us. I cannot embarrass the entire country to save your CM's reputation. You only have to handle law and order. I need to handle the entire parliament. We'll have to send them in. Make sure there's no one within the perimeter. Hello. I know, sir. Sir, try to understand. Sir, the NSG will… But, sir… The situation can become... Sir, try to understand! Sir… Mr. Malik… That man will kill my wife. If you guys are helpless, then let me know. I'll try to do something. What will you do? Sir, I'll get the money anyhow. - Wait. - Just a minute. Sir, just tell him that I'm ready to pay the ransom. Please. Mr. Sinha, only higher officials have the right to negotiate with terrorists. I can't do anything. And as you can see, I'm trying my level best. I can guarantee you one thing… Haq Gul won't make it out alive. Your approach is wrong, sir. Your goal is not to kill Haq Gul! It's to rescue my wife. Your wife can only be rescued when we kill Haq Gul. Is that your logic? Really? Do you mean to say that there is no way out? Is that all you idiots can do? - Mind your language. - To hell with language, sir! You are to be blamed for this. You're the reason my wife's life is in danger. It's all because of all of you! You guys should join a circus! Nobody goes to a circus anymore, but people will surely come to see you jokers! Do we look like jokers to you? Yes, you do! He is a terrorist who was handcuffed yet he managed to escape from the custody of 12 police officers and that too by snatching their gun. That only happens to jokers! - You're crossing the line now! - Shut up! I said shut up! Couldn't even protect your gun! How will you protect my wife? - You shut up! - Sir. One more word from you, and I will bury you alive! What will you do? - Throw him out! - Why will you throw me out? I'll go out myself, and tell the media. I want the NSG! It's because Mumbai Police have no guts! - You want to see my guts? - Yes! - I'll show you. - Why don't you deal with him? Deal with him first! Sir, please calm down. The media is here. Please. Sir… if you don't do something in 30 minutes, then I'll get the money and go up. I prefer to die with my wife than to stand here and do nothing. Sir, she is with a terrorist. She's not in her sane mind. She could die! And I am out here. I'll do anything I can. Mr. Sinha, are you alright? Yeah. Your anger is justified. But this is not the time to fight. It's time we should trust each other. I am sorry. I know that… You can arrange the money to save your wife, but believe me… We haven't come to that situation yet. Trust me. I don't understand one thing. Why did Haq Gul come down with your wife? And that too with an empty gun. My gun was loaded. He changed his plan. Why did he do it? What was his plan? Sir… Saanchi. I don't know why I was trying to be romantic! What were you thinking? You kept the bullets in your pocket. Forgot the plan? So… You're awake. Idiot! You thought I was stupid. Who are you? What? Who are you? What did you say? What are you doing at my house? Where's my husband? Do you want to know? What do you want? Do you want money? - What do you want? - Shut up! Otherwise, I will kill you and myself. People like you and me don't deserve to live. Come on. Come out with me. This city is worse than a prison! My life's turned hell since I got here. Sit. Sit here. Give me your hands. My trust was broken, then my bones were broken and now… I'm heartbroken as well. I am born with bad luck. But, I won't break my promise. You wished to die, right? Right? - I will fulfill your wish. - I don't want to die, please. Please don't kill me. Don't kill me. None of this is uncommon in her condition, Mr. Malik. She has done it before. When she senses she's cornered… She will use anyone to achieve her goal. Although we all have this ability, but those who are mentally stable, can control it. But Saanchi cannot. Right now, Gul is alone with her… And he is in control. Now Saanchi will try to charm him, and do anything possible to gain control over the situation. We can call this her vulnerability. Vulnerability or skill? She almost spilled beans… Over Gul's planning. Mr. Sinha, we thought the situation is under control. But as you can see, the pressure on me is building. So we'll have to call NSG. I am going to tell you something… But I am not authorized to do so. But in your case, I'll make an… You know. If you think you can arrange the money, before the orders arrive, then… Then I won't stop you. Mr. Malik I never thought I'd tell this to a stranger. Saanchi is having an affair with someone. Affair? Who? I mean… I mean… do you know the guy? No, I don't… But Saanchi has changed our bank passwords, and the password to the locker in our house. I think she wants to take everything, and run away with that person. It's hard to believe this relationship that's forged between us. Our reputation is being publicly humiliated. And coincidentally, we are the only spectators of this drama. My husband will give you whatever you want. Please talk to him once. There are other people in our building. Someone must have called the police. The police have surrounded the building. They are all dressed in their uniforms. And you claim the police must be on their way. If you utter another word, I'll put a bullet through your head! Gul! Don't shoot. Please don't shoot me. Please don't. Please! Don't! Please don't shoot me. Please don't. Mister, please give her the pills anyhow. Otherwise, her condition can get unstable and she will be a threat to all of us. Those pills are to make me crazy and not treat me. I start acting weirdly after taking those pills. And that's what Yathaarth wants. It needs sugar. I ruined my own life. Look, ma'am, listen to me. You're Saanchi, and I am Gul. Haq Gul. "Gul" means flower. Did you recollect it? Your husband deceives you and gives you those pills. He wants to prove you're crazy. Are you mad? I must know for sure. Is this the real you, or was that the real you? I am not talking about this thing. I will keep it aside. Now listen to me carefully. Your husband is a bastard. He's having an affair with your doctor. Remember? You wanted to run away with me. Remember? No? Oh, God! Why? Malik! I won't wait any longer! I don't want Jibran. I just want the money and a car right now! Now! Right now! And her husband will bring it up! Right now! And no one will come up with him! Mr. Malik… This is the best opportunity we got. I'll get 50 lakh rupees in an hour. Just promise me that the police won't take any action. Please, Mr. Malik. And I want to speak with Gul. I want to assure him. What are you thinking? This is our last chance. For you, for me, and for Saanchi. You said that if the NSG gets here, then situation will be out of your control. Please, Mr. Malik, let me talk to him. Please. Bapat. Gul. This is Yathaarth Sinha. - Sir. - You... You will get your money. I'll get it myself. And I'll bring it up alone. And I promise the police won't take any action. Just promise me that you won't do anything until I don't return. If you try any of your tricks, then I will shoot your… POLICE The scuffle between the Centre and State Government has put an innocent woman's life and her husband's entire life's savings at stake. What can a common man do? But the question that arises here is, why should Yathaarth Sinha pay the price for Mumbai Police's failure? - Download this. - Sir. Jai Hind, sir. Malik, the NSG is on its way. You're on your own now. Sawant. Get the operation planned. If Sinha doesn't arrive on time, then we're going in. Before NSG. Understood? But, sir, Force One is on its way. They are stuck in traffic at Chembur. To hell with Force One! Get the QRT force prepped. - Tell them to gear up. - But sir… These guys can't make it here from Chembur. When will NSG arrive from Delhi, and handle the situation? Give me a status update. Every minute is unbearable right now. Can't figure out who's crazier, the wife or the bloody husband? Or have they both lost it? And the biggest asshole is this guy… Who comes down at will. And then he changes his plan. And he came down with an empty gun! What's going on? Get some tea. Sir, the media's asking for a byte. They want an official statement. Get some tea. We'll talk to the media at the right time. - Hello. - Hi, Thomas. - Hi. - Any luck. No. I am so sorry. I tried. No problem, boss. I understand. - Thanks for trying. - Sorry again. I'll call you later, bye. Hi. It's good that you called, sir. I was about to leave. Thank you so much. - Is it all here? - Yes, sir. It has 37,0400 rupees in it. I've kept 10,000 rupees to keep the account active. Okay. Really appreciate this. Thank you so much. - Sir, just sign the receipt. - Yeah, of course. Take this, sir. This is important. Sir, we're with you and Ms. Saanchi. I really appreciate it. Thank you. - Hi, Yathaarth. - Hey, Vishal, Yathaarth speaking. Yeah, I've arranged the cash. Come over. Oh! Thanks, Brother. Thank you so much. I owe you one. I am at the office. Come over. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Okay, thanks. Bye, Bro. Move. Each man for himself. Mumbai Police has given up in the Saanchi Hostage Case. Complete surrender! On the other hand, Yathaarth Sinha… Is trying to arrange 50 lakh rupees. The nation wants to know! Mumbai wants to know! I want to know! Who are we waiting for? Tell us! Stay tuned and we'll see you after the break. Sir, four of our officers will pulley from Taneja chambers to this building. Sir, the ATS team will enter from access number two. And sir, our team will cover from below. Good. When all the teams are at their respective points, then contact me. - Yes, sir. - Disperse. Yeah. Gul… Do you remember my name now? Or is this a new trick? Right arm around the diagonal. I am hungry, Gul. Don't annoy me, ma'am. If you're hungry, then you'll have to bear it. And don't try to act smart. How can I use any tricks? My hands are tied. Who knows when you'll shoot me. Why should I die starving? You can at least get some juice for me. It's kept in the fridge. Please. Thank you. Vishal. Bro, thank you so much. I'll return the money as soon as things are normal again. Don't worry, bro. I know the things you've done for Saanchi. Please, just go and solve this problem. I don't know what to do. Even I am scared thinking about what Saanchi's going through. - Go on. - Thanks, Vishal. - I'll call you later. - Take care, okay? Okay, bye. Thanks, man. You don't have to untie me. You can make me drink it. What if you untie me and I try one of my tricks? Do you know something, Gul? Even Yathaarth's never fed me so romantically. I am so unlucky. What happened? Are you mad at me? Won't you talk to me? Won't you drink some? Shall I feed you? You're unbelievable, madam. Which man would want to leave you for another woman? Your life's at stake but still you want to play tricks? Naughty girl. Really? You get down here. I'll call you once the issue is sorted. Okay. Take care. Vidya, thanks for everything. - And I'll wait for your call. - Yeah. What? You'll screw me again, right? You're dumb, Gul… like every other man. All the bloody same. When women are screwing with you… You're all smiling. And when she isn't… You're falling for her. Bloody fools! You spoiled my mood. There isn't a single man in this world, who knows what women want. Not even one. Neither you, nor Yathaarth, or him. Him? Who is he? How does it matter? There is someone. I wanted to run away to the UK… And that too forever. But you showed up first. After spending some time with you, I thought of canceling the UK plan. I'll run away with you. But, you're just… In a recent update from Spring Shine Building, that the police have agreed to Haq Gul's terms. The police have decided to give him a car, and the desired amount on his terms. The nation wants to know! India wants to know! Even I want to know! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! I want to know! India wants to know! Tell me! After Sinha enters the building… All your teams will be alert and wait for my command to get in. Nobody moves till I order to, understood? - Yes, sir! - Disperse. - Sir! - Sir! Sir, the media has released an official statement. Good. At least someone's on our side. Sir. Get the phone status checked. Okay, sir. - And where is Sinha? Any news? - Bapat is checking on him. Please come. Move. I have got the entire amount. But, Mr. Malik, I will go alone. Don't worry. You'll go alone. But you must follow the instructions. If all goes as per plan, then when you hand over the bag to him, and he'll head downstairs with your wife, then you'll come to the window and signal us. Hopefully, my boys will get a clean shot in your car. And what if nothing goes… According to plan? If there's even a slight change in the plan, then I'll break-in with my entire team. And in that case, you'll take custody of your wife, and get on the ground. - Understood? - Yeah. Good. Don't worry. Even if he's well-trained… My team is an equal match for him. I am telling the truth. The truth! Believe me. Once he gives me the money… I will get you out of here! Don't you trust me? Wait a minute. Come. Come with me! Come here. This is what he's been giving you. And I had mixed these in your tea as well. I am sorry. But I will never do this again. It's done! I don't know… If you're crazy or not… But I am madly in love with you. And I won't leave without you. Really? Gul. As decided… Mr. Sinha is coming up alone and unarmed. It would be foolish to change your plan now. Gul, make sure you fulfill your promise and I'll fulfill mine. Malik, I'll do as I promised. But I won't spare you if you try to trick me. Understood? I've told you my truth. I'm risking my life to get you out of here. Don't betray me this time. As we told you earlier, we've been getting thousands of calls and messages from all over the country, in support of Saanchi Sinha. We only expect to see Saanchi Sinha get out of this predicament unharmed. #SaveSaanchi Move! I am innocent. I didn't kill her. I am innocent. Listen to me. Listen to me. I didn't kill her. I am innocent. I didn't kill her. I am innocent. I didn't kill her. He killed her. I didn't kill her. I am innocent. I didn't kill her, Mr. Malik! I didn't kill her. I am innocent. I didn't kill her, Mr. Malik! I didn't kill her. I am innocent. I didn't kill her. I am innocent. I didn't kill her. If I wanted to kill her, I would've killed the husband as well. - I didn't kill her. - Come on. I didn't kill her. He killed her. I didn't kill her. Take him away. Mr. Malik! I will have the witness, Mr. Yathaarth Sinha's statement, before the honorable court. Your honor… When I went upstairs… Come on. Come inside. Close the door. Yathaarth. Close the door! Did you get the money? Don't harm her. I've got the money. Saanchi, are you okay? Did something happen? Yathaarth, give this man the money quickly. - Take me away from here. - Okay. Here you go. The money is all here. Count it. "This man?" Madam, my name is Haq Gul. Yathaarth… - Madam… - Stop. Madam… You're ending everything. I told you not to betray me again. What is this man saying? - What is he saying? - I told you not to betray me again. Come on, Saanchi. I told you not to betray me. No. Order. I'll have the accused, Haq Gul's statement in the court now. Before I read the verdict, do you want to say anything in your defense, Haq? Your honor… why would I kill her? We loved each other. We wanted to be together. Madam wanted to come live with me in Kashmir. He used to give madam some pills to make her crazy. Madam told me this herself. And that day, he came up looking for the pills. And when he came inside… Madam and I were about to… Come down with the bag. Come in. Close the door. Did you get the money? Here's your money. It's all there. And do what you want to. Just tell me… Where madam's pills are. What's the point? You can't give it to her anymore. Because madam is going with me. And I've already flushed the pills. Idiot! Why didn't you tell me earlier? I didn't have to do all this drama. Do you want to run away with this woman? Go ahead. Run away with this witch. You both will die together. Go on. Leave. - You bastard! You asshole! - Hands up! Yeah, you crazy fuck! - Haq, you love me, right? - Yes. Kill him. Just shoot him. - What? - Shoot him. Just shoot him down! Asshole! Disgusting person. - Just shoot him. - Listen to me, Haq. This woman is crazy. She will take you down with her. - Don't listen to her. - Just shut up. Kill him. - Listen to me. Look in her eyes. - Just shut up! Look in her eyes. This woman is crazy. She is crazy! Gul is lying, ma'am. And as for Mr. Sinha. He was with me the entire day. And was desperately doing everything possible that any husband would do to save his wife. He faced several challenges like arranging the money that Gul demanded. Actually, your honor… I've known Gul for the past couple of months. I had arrested him earlier. And I realized during the interrogation that… He was not mentally stable. Most of his statements are imaginary stories, which has no real characters. So post the Spring Shine incident, I had him tested by a well-certified government psychiatrist. And proved that he has mental conditions. I've submitted the reports. The hearing is at the Supreme Court. The court will give a verdict for the Byculla Blast and Saanchi murder case. In the matter of Mumbai Police versus Haq Riyaz Gul. On account of the murder under section 302 of the IPC, the court finds Haq Riyaz Gul guilty. Upholding the 13 murders before this one, the court sentences him to death for this murder as well. But since he's mentally unstable, the death penalty cannot be executed until his treatment isn't completed. So the court orders that once he's treated… In any government certified mental facility, his sentence will be carried out. That's my verdict. You got saved. Get in! Take him away. Okay, sir. If you don't want her to get well… And her insanity keeps growing, then give her these instead of my pills. I'll arrange more when you run out of it. I have no choice. If I ask for a divorce, that crazy woman will throw me out on the streets. Madam needs to take these pills every four hours. But she won't take it willingly. We must give her these pills anyhow. What do I do, Yashodha? Don't worry, sir. I'll give madam these pills on time. If the police get their hands on our pills, and they run a test… We will be royally fucked! Fuck! Yathaarth, do something. Just change those pills. I don't care how it's done. - Just do it. - Vidya, listen. Keep a bottle of the prescription pills ready. I'll call you, okay? You get off here. I'll call you when the matter is solved. Take care. Vidya, thanks for everything. - And I'll wait for your call. - Yeah. Your police verification has delayed my UK visa. Madam, we did come. You were not at home. You should have called before coming! You have mentioned on this form that you're a "Housewife". Does housewife mean I'll always be in the house? Can't I step out? You are a common man, aren't you? Don't you have even an ounce of common sense? What's all the commotion about? Sir… this madam… What happened, ma'am? Any problem? Yes! According to your officer, housewives should be at home 24/7. What's this, Bapat? Bring madam's paper inside. Come with me, ma'am. Have a seat! I apologize on his behalf. By the way, I am ACP Harishchandra Malik. Saanchi Sinha. By the way… You don't look like a housewife at all. I mean you're more like a model. Madam, just sign these papers, and your verification is done. - Bring some coffee for madam. - Yes, sir. Can I be of any help? I mean… if you have any other problem, you can take down my number. 9-8-1-0-6-3… Will you run away with me? Will you take me to the UK? Quit this job. Baby… Our love is not for running away from the world. In fact… It's here to stay. Funny. You cracked a joke, right? If you're serious, then you will lose your job, your house and your life for rape charges. And since you're a cop… You know the routine. SMS, DNA test, abetment to suicide. But you were joking, right? You got upset. I am falling in love all over again Sir, today is Haq Gul's jail transfer. Start the car. Open the door. You guys sit in the front. I'll sit with him. Okay, sir. Come on. Every man who is about to die, his last wish is that he doesn't want to die. And yet he's asked his last wish. Do you know why? It's because sometimes an angel arrives in his life, who fulfills his last wish. I can save you from the death sentence. You've to do something for me. But why do you want to get her killed? Silly man. Don't ask for a reason. You should ask how you can escape the death sentence. Call her husband alone inside the house. And it will be my responsibility to send him alone. As soon as the job's done… You can blame that idiot for it! Say whatever rubbish you can come up with. It's my responsibility to prove you mentally unstable at the court. And then you won't be sentenced to death. Bravo, my boy. Hey! - Untie me. - Hey! - Untie me. - Lower the gun! - Untie me. - Lower the gun! Hit me! - Stop the car! - Stop the car! - Stop the car! - Stop him. Call the control room. - Yes, sir. - Call the control room. - Calling. - Call them! Listen… I've submitted the certificate to prove your mental instability. You can tell whatever you want to. I never break my promise. You better don't break yours. It's because I've been holding Jibran for the past six months. If you try to double-cross me again… I swear… I will shoot him. Smile. Can I ask you a question? That guy… Is ACP Malik, right? Right? You heard everyone's version of the truth… And now hear his version as well. According to his plan… I have to shoot you in the house. But I won't. In fact, I'll take you downstairs with me. Because he cannot shoot you down there. But if he shoots me… Don't let him get away with it, madam. Rather than spending my life in an asylum… I would… Spend it with you. I didn't kill her! Had I wanted to kill her, I would've killed them both! I didn't kill her! Rascal… I gave you the idea. Why are you screaming in my ears? Mr. Malik, I didn't kill her! Her husband killed her. You didn't kill her? Very good! - Scream louder. - It's true, sir. Take him away. I didn't commit a single murder but I have been held guilty of 14 murders. The liars are set free… But the truth is locked up in the asylum!
