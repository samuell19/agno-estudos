Hey, buddy. Pay up. Come on, let me kiss you. Pay up. Fine! Here you go. Give me a kiss. No. That hurt, help me up. Lower your voice, you will wake the neighbours. So? I like to be loud, I want to be loud. Shut up! Look, you've woken everyone up. I like to be loud. They're throwing bottles out! What's that about? How could they? That's my dinner. Wang Guangtai. Police! Freeze! Freeze! Stand still. Freeze! Stop running! Freeze! Stop! Hey...someone's here. Who could that be? Don't know. Open up... it's me, Tai. It's Ah Tai. Open up. Close the door. Hey, what happened? What happened? A bunch of policemen spotted me, and I killed one of them. Could they have noticed our plan already? Impossible, we haven't done anything. Without proof, the police won't make any arrest. Could it be the gun dealer who ratted us out? Hey, let's put it on hold. Put it on hold? We've been out of prison for a few months now. Have you seen the rest of the brothers? What about them? They're all dressed up in nice suits and shoes, and we're like beggars. How come we can't have what they have? When we borrow money from someone, we're just like beggars. And I've killed a cop. Even if we put the plan on hold, we still need to be on the run. That's right. Since it's done, we might as well take the risk. If we succeed, we can go on a vacation. Vacation? The cops could catch us anytime. That's right, pack up. You're underage. So what? Go, brat. So out of line. Don't cry, auntie. You can't bring the dead back to life. Sorry for your loss. Hurry... What are you doing? You did it on purpose. You hit me? What's wrong with you? He beats me. You think this is home? Move on. Hurry. What's your name? Speak up. -7086. -Here. Get his statement. Yes, sir. -2698. -Here. Charge them for possession of arms, and attacking a police officer. Bring the gun dealer to my office. The sergeant is taking a statement. Where's the sergeant? Downstairs. I've only seen Wang Guangtai, pal. He bought four pistols for himself? What for? Those pistols are made from toy guns, sir. They aren't real. Stop lying. Kin was killed by an automatic pistol. If you didn't sell him the guns, Kin wouldn't be dead. If I can't catch him, you're dead. I really don't know where he is; What do you expect me to say? You don't know. Stop the act. Sergeant, do you know that you'll receive a complaint by doing this? Is he licensed? Should I give him some tea and cake too? Alright, I'll take over this case from now on. You're off the case, leave. Off the case? Do you know that a colleague died because of this case? Kin just transferred to operations, it hasn't even been two weeks. Today was his first operational job, and his last. That makes sense. Send out operations if there's any danger, when we're back we still need to hear all this crap. You won't feel the pain if you don't get hurt. You think only you've served on operations? I was assigned to it for two years. From now on, you must go by the book. Go by the book? I don't know what that is. Sergeant, Kin's mom wants to see you. Go by the book? What is the rule when talking to the victim's family? Sorry. Good game. Of course. Where should we go for lunch? How about seafood? Can Cheng book a court? I'm sure he will think of something. Your opponent is too weak, I'll play against you. Be my guest. Watch it, my serve. Are they fighting or playing squash? There's an empty court, let's go. Let's go. This is the victim's autopsy report. Broken ribs, which fractured the liver, that's the cause of death. But I couldn't find any signs of bruises around the ribs. So it could be done by bare hands. Zeng Cai was a boxing champion, and he was Xu Wen's right-hand man. Who would dare to do this? That's right. Could be other gangs who weren't happy about their share. Thank you, doc. How's the injured man in the changing room? Still in critical condition. Say no more. I think this is the right time to sell this current load. No. If we haven't found out what happened to Cai, we can't sell. That's right, it's going to be trouble. I think you're a bunch of idiots. We must sell the load now. Who are you to call the shots here? If I can get you out, I can send you back in. How about this? Find out who killed Cai within three days. I want him to go back where he comes from. Excuse me, I've been waiting for a long time. Just wait a while, Mr Qiu. Mr. Xu is still in a meeting. You're very pretty. Mr. Qiu... Mr. Xu, he... Mr. Xu, sorry to interrupt. I'm here to tell you something. Your old buddy was killed in my jurisdiction. Do you suspect me, fool? If I spread a word, and say that the murderer is my enemy, then everyone will find him... And then... That's not the point. I suspect someone's unhappy with his share. What do you mean? Mr. Xu, we all know what business you run. Mr. Qiu. You're just a worker for law enforcement. And I like to challenge the law. Talk to my lawyer if you need anything. Very well. I'd be glad to deal with you if I have the chance. You're not even qualified. Even after such a long time there's not a clue! That guy is such a smug, Let's teach him a lesson sometime. Hey, are you full? You want another one? I'm full. Full? You used to eat my share in prison. Go on. Waiter, a big bowl. A big bowl. Any news on the cars? It will cost over a grand. Tai and his girlfriend are trying to find some cash. But Tai is in hiding right now. We should really think of a plan. Exactly. My name is "Brainless", but I'm here if my brothers need me. What about a bet? A bet? Place your bets... Place your bets... Draw the middle tiles. Place your bets... Three, four, five, twelve... big. Small win. Come on... Hurry... Hurry. That's wrong. What are you doing? That's wrong. Who's betting more? The one betting more will call the shots. Come on. You even, you lose. Look, I told you to put three and four. Why seven? Should stop. Do you know how to bet? Who has lost more here? Bad luck. Let's go. Shut up, go to another table. Place your bets... Any more cash? Lost it all. Lost it all? Five hundred for this. What? A cheesy watch like this for five hundred? Beat it! You two. It costs around a thousand for a new one. Shut up. Shut up, go. What about three hundred? No way. Come on, help us out here. What for? Here is five hundred! You owe me two hundred. Stop it... Sorry, he's drunk. Stop... Please stop. If you want cash, tell your mom to be a hooker. You call my mom a hooker? Freeze, on the floor... Freeze, or I'll shoot. Asshole. You said my mom is a hooker? Brainless, let's go! Brainless, hurry. Come on! Stop... Brainless. Enough. Come on! On the ground! Freeze. Freeze... Don't try to follow us. Sorry. When the same suspect comes up in two cases. Then it's up to how serious the case is in order to determine which team will follow. This case could be related to heroin. If my estimations are right, we could solve both cases. That's why I hope to get information from you. It's not that I don't want to help. You don't need to doubt that. It's just that we don't want to alarm them. You know how long it takes for us to set up a lead. If the information isn't confidential, and we are acting rash, the plan will fail, and we'll put our informants in danger. Great, thanks for your cooperation. I'm warning you, I won't interfere with your murder case, but please don't get involved with the heroin case. I get it. Come on, let's go. Team leader. We've found out that Wang Guangtai had two buddies when he was in jail, here's their information. Sir. We haven't seen Wang Guangtai for a while. I know he has a girlfriend, who works in a bar. Don't mess up inside. You've guts. If you don't do Brother Cheng a favour, you'll be sorry. Listen, if you hurt any of my men again, I'll kill you all. Your staff "Chopper" came and picked on my girl here, you're the one who has a problem. Picked on your girl? The girl came on to him. So? Can I help you? Sir? We're all licensed here. And we're having such a good time. And now... We're only here for a drink, we'll pay. But... But what? Are we welcome here? Certainly, what would you like? Milk. Sir, the man with the two girls, that's their ring leader. It's a great day today. Bottoms up! Zheng. He's getting on my nerves. Alright then. What? Nothing. I don't like your face. I want to ask you something. Please tell your brothers to step aside. I don't know you. You don't need to know me. We're born enemies. Don't try to threaten me. I've a weak heart; If I move, it will fire. Step back. Step back... You can talk now. Sir. You took me here because you want to ask me about this? I don't know who's Xu Wen. I'll charge you with obstructing police investigation, armed robbery, attacking an officer... What? Don't try to frame me. Frame you? Do you want to tell the judge that you like watermelons? Why are you carrying a watermelon knife around? Guess who the judge will believe? You or me? This alone will give you five years in prison. Are you serious? So do you want to talk to the judge or me? Xu Wen, from what I heard... Go on. Xu Wen stole some drugs from a Thai gang. They've sent a hit man here, to get rid of Xu Wen and Zeng Cai. Stand here. Brother... I told you to stand there, can't you hear? Can we trust this guy? If Xu Wen really stole the drugs, Narcotics must have the file. You can look into it. I tried, they said it's confidential. That is what you want to know. Wang Guangtai had two buddies in prison, one's called Long, the other "Brainless" they all got out of prison around the same time. Long and Brainless robbed a casino yesterday, they shot a bouncer. Buying four guns among the three of them, it wouldn't be just robbing a small casino. Exactly. Drop me off at the end of the street. You want to catch Xu Wen? You've got a plan? You follow Ming, he's one of Xu's associates. Take me along too. Don't catch a cold. Hey! How can I walk back? Damn! Play me like that. That guy is here. The route of the armoured vehicle. And the time? I won't know until in the afternoon. How do I contact you? You can't contact us, just liaise with Lily. Very well, remember my share. Can we trust him? Don't worry, he's old. He's retiring in two years, he just wants some money for retirement. Industrial district. Where do you usually go for fun? I've had many clients. No, I meant I've met lots of people. But hardly am I so satisfied. Later on those guys often ask me whether it was good for me. Not at all! They're nothing compared to you. Here's a thousand for you. I'll give you change. Keep the change. Thanks, I'll give you 20% off next time. Bye. Lian, you're in a good mood. Have you struck gold? You could say that; Well, I'm off. Leaving so soon, let's have a chat. That's right. Time is money. I'll treat you to tea some day. Deal. We're from the ClD. Stay inside. Where's room 1 05? The third one. We're from ClD, it's nothing. Back in your room. We're of ClD, stay inside no matter what you hear. Back in your room. Who is it? Telephone company. Hold on. Don't move... The armoured vehicle will be behind. I'll stop it from the front. Ah Long, try to block it from the rear. Brother Tai, it's very risky here. Now you're scared? What about when robbing the casino? There's nothing to be scared of. Just shoot. They're armed too. We'll risk it. Risk? I think... Listen! I call the shots here. We'll have to see whose side God is on then. What are you scared of, chicken? I'm a woman and I'm not scared. You're a man! Fool. Right, we're in this together. Why are you scared? Lily, be careful at work these few days. Don't talk too much. Are you sure the stuff is here? Yes. Over at Li Qiu. Li Qiu? Zijian? Uncle. Thanks for taking care of my dad all these years. Don't mention it, Zijian. It's very dangerous for you to be back. You're dead if Xu Wen finds you. I can't hide forever. I'm here to kill him. And Zeng Cai? He stole Brother Qi's drugs, and betrayed me. Brother Qi took care of me for the last eight years. I must kill Zeng Cai no matter what. Zijian, everything is different now. Are you confident? I don't know. The cassette has proof of Xu Wen's crime. I forced Li Qiu to record it, and these... if something happens to me... What's that for? You ruined Xu Wen's six operations eight years ago. What did he leave you other than a scar? You think this is worth it? What about next time? How many more times you have to risk your life? Uncle, this is my last. I'm sick of it. I feel terrible even dealing with the small potatoes. Maybe I'm getting old. I'm glad you think like this. When do you plan to work? Tonight. That guy from Thailand killed Cai within one week of his arrival. Now he's got 80% of the load. And, if the police finds the cassette tape Then they'll have proof, and it's 'game over' for us. Don't think that I can't kill you. After I take care of this, you better die. And you bunch of losers, he's been back for a while, and I haven't even seen his face. I'll give you three more days. What's the matter? Hurry, cut it off. Freeze. Freeze. Lower your weapon. Are you alright? I'm fine. Take the weapon to the lab, tell me when you have the results. Don't move anything until after the pictures are taken. Got it. You're here quite fast. Are you here to protect me or keep an eye on me? Whatever you think. I need to know who wants to kill you, and why. Why? I should be asking you instead of you asking me. Very well, I'll find out sooner or later who wants you dead. I'll ask him why then. Mr. Xu. We'll keep you posted. Lily Coming. I have one-third of the share. The ship leaves at 3:30am three days later. I expect the four of you. So? Whatever. Remember, I allow you on board only if I see the goods. Sorry. You're ten minutes early. We couldn't find the woman in her home. That woman must be hiding at her boyfriend's. It's your fault. You knew that Narcotics was keeping an eye on Ming, why did you tell me to follow the case? Do you know that the supervisors are blaming me now? They want an explanation. How would I know? I told you to follow, I didn't tell you to spill it. Why didn't you say so? Sorry... Quiet you two. This is a hospital. Your skull and ribs are alright. But you've had a concussion, you must be admitted for observation. What? Admitted? I've got work to do. You... Sergeant Zhao. Have you got anything? That old guy in the pub works in Hong Kong Jewelery Shop. They must be planning to rob it. Should we arrest him? Not yet, don't alarm them. Doctor, let him go. Thanks. Can I help you? I'm Qiu Zhenming, and this is Sergeant Zhao. What is it about? We would like to talk to your manager. Sure, just a minute. Thanks. Watch your speech later. I'm a hooligan, I don't care about my manners. You do the talking. Mr. Qiu, the manager is ready to see you now. Thanks. Mr. Xu. Are my nails done nicely? What's wrong with you? You've spilled things on my dress. Mr. Xu is here, take it over. Sorry, Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu. Ah Long, take a look. The women of Dominican Republic are gorgeous, sun, sea and sand. We'll be there in two days. Right, I'll pick the best beach. Brainless. The women there go skinny dipping. Stop pacing. Can you be quiet? Are you scared now? Scared? For 7 years I was in prison I wasn't scared. I want to tell you something. Can it wait until we leave Hong Kong? Are you sure we can leave Hong Kong? I'm pregnant. Don't worry, no matter what happens, I won't leave you on your own. Make sure we can take care of ourselves. We wouldn't know who's walking out on whom then. What should we do the day after tomorrow? What do you mean? Don't worry. Lily will be watching out. It will be fine. Your son can be born in Dominican Republic. He sure knows how to pick. I'll be a dad soon. You're a future dad. And I'll be an uncle soon. Same here. Dear nephew, I'm your uncle. Boy or girl? Just listen. Stop it. What are you two doing? Look! A dead person. He fell from so high. Hurry. Don't panic, calm down. Start the engine. Did you bring it? Yes. Again. Okay. Check the gun. Have you noticed the brown car at the back? It's been tailing us since we left the shop. Step on the gas. I think they're speeding up. Have they spotted us? Guess not, go on. Try to get closer. Tai will be backing us up at front. Got it. Hurry. The target is behind, sir. A brown Jaguar, Iicense plate CT81 5, over. Got it. Stick with the original plan, over. Are you blind? Freeze. This is a robbery. Open up... Freeze. Freeze. Stop running. Go! Don't shoot... Move over, hurry. Freeze. Don't move... Move over... Or I'll shoot him. Freeze. Move over... Don't try anything. Move back, can't you hear? Get away. Move back... or I'll put a bullet in his head. Get up. Move back... Ah Tai, leave. Step back. He'll die if you don't send him to the hospital. Hand me the jewelery suitcase. Now. Take the suitcase and run. No! We'll run together. I don't want anything. Jewels. Good girl. Go on. I won't leave. Go. No. Hurry. Go! Hurry. Tai. Don't go after her. No! Tai... Why didn't you wait for me, Tai? Tai. Tai... Tai... Why are you here so late? Remember to be on time, I won't wait. Remember, the ship leaves at 3am sharp. Hello. Xu Wen is the head of the drug syndicate. Xu stole the drugs of Liu Qi in Thailand. You heard that? If you don't want the cassette tape to fall in the hands of police, meet me at Whampoa containers warehouse 3 hours later. Hello I don't believe you're superman. I just can't work alongside with him. In our line of work, how can you let your emotions control you? I beg you to transfer him out of operations. Sergeant. I've read your record, and have looked into this. We're the disciplined forces, & we cannot use an individual way to deal with matters. I agree with Mr. Qiu; Tomorrow onwards... you are no longer a member of the operations. I'll arrange new work duties for you. Y es, sir. Thank you, sir. Sir, Xu Wen has left home, something's up. You know where they are heading? No, but Danny's following him. Great, tell everyone to cancel their vacation, and be on call. Yes, sir. Did you hear it? Yes, could be him. Petrol. Hurry... Where is he? Look here, hurry. Hurry... You two go there, the others follow me. I see him. He's gone to the No.3 warehouse. Wait here. I'll inform Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu, we have lots of casualties on our side. No matter what, I want him dead. Yes. Sir. So? The target is above, there's no need to fire. We need him alive. Team one go at front. Yes. Team two, follow me. Yes. Cover him. Y es. Team one cover him. Y es. Team two guard there. Y es. Are you alright? That way. Follow me. Don't run, freeze. He's injured by our men. Let me deal with him. I don't want any casualties. He can't run anymore, surround him. Y es. He's heading towards the black container. Go down. Siege this warehouse. Don't charge in unless it's necessary. Yes, follow me. You can't take care of him on your own. Cover me. Go in...
