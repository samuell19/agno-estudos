Madi, take off those nasty shoes. Fine. Watch that tone, girl. Honey. Get up! Stop. Stop it, you're ridiculous! Come on, get up! Mama, when's dinner? Soon, baby. All right, what was I doing? Ah, eggs, please. Yes. Levi, can you get some milk from the store? Is your daddy still asleep? Yeah. Levi, get up! You're gonna be late! I'm up. I'm up. Oh! ...and their headlight had been busted for like a week or something, but then I get-- I get over there and they had duct-taped four high-res flashlights to it to use as the headlights. James, you've been a bad liar since seventh grade, and that ain't changed. -Huh, yeah. -I shit you not, that's what happened! You getting excited? I ain't got nothing to be excited about. Still got four weeks or so. Although, I would be a little more excited if it had just a bit more testosterone in it, you know? I'll tell Ashley you said that. - Yeah, do that, see what happens. - Oh, oh! - Y'all remember when Madi was born -and Levi, like, forgot that we existed for like two years? -I didn't. -Yes. -Oh, hell yeah, it two years. Yeah, that's true. Mark my words, second this baby is born, he's gonna be driving around town with a pink car seat in his truck. There ain't no pink car seats going in my truck. - Oh, really? - The man is a prophet. -I foresee car seats. -I've been pulling blue-- Pink car seats, bows in your hair, pink fingernails. No, it's gonna be blue regardless. All right, bud. God damn it. Hey. Hey, you awake? Baby, I forgot milk. I'm sorry, hon. I'll get some tomorrow before work, okay? Hey. What the hell? Ashley? Ashley! Baby. Holy fuck. Baby! Ashley! Oh, shit. Babe. Oh, babe, no, no, no! No, listen, you're fine. You're fine. Baby, come here! Baby, come here, come here. Oh, God! Hold on. Don't worry, you're gonna be fine! Code blue, room 305. You know what I found out today? What's that? Found out the sex of the baby. That was today? You cannot remember a thing, can you? So am I getting a boy this time? - Is that all you're worried about? I don't understand. You want help? No, I got it. Hmm-mm, look, if you take-- Daddy, I got it! Madi? Fine. Look, seven plus seven, 14. Carry the one. Five plus five, ten. Carry one again. Two plus two is four. So 404. You see how I did that? - Mm. - Okay. Dad? Yeah, baby? Did you get my new notebook? No, baby, I forgot. I'm sorry. -But... -I'll get you one tomorrow, all right? - Y'all need to lock your outdoors, man. - Uncle Barrett! - Hey, Madi girl. Amanda wanted me to bring y'all this casserole. Uh, all right, dude. Just put it in the fridge. All right. All right. Hey, Madi, it's about time for bed, isn't it? - Can I stay up with Uncle Barrett? - -Mm. All right, yeah, ten more minutes. Uh, come on, bro. Huh? Huh? Hey, Madi girl, what's up? Oh, stupid. Come on. Come on. There. Oh, man. It was pretty close. Oh, you're getting faster. Madi, it's time for bed. Ow! You got distracted. Jeez. You want a beer? She puts herself to sleep? Yeah. Hmm. You know, I just can't believe how upbeat she still is. Yeah, man, she's a kid, you know. Bounce back from anything. Hmm? I gotta leave soon. All right, dude. Two for me. To the 35, to the 40... Yo, I watched the replay of that Titans game this morning. -Oh, that return from kickoff? Ah! -Ain't that some bull. Oh, hey, I got some, uh, some leftover dinner if you want any? What, your Dollar Store hot dogs? -Nah, I'ma leave soon anyway, man. -All right. So what's going on? Amanda send you over here to check on me? No. It's not like that. -It's not like that. -Yeah, I'm fine. What? - Now come on, man. I-- I haven't seen you in weeks. -Look, I'm not trying to be a pansy or nothin', but-- -What? No, I'm saying if-- if you-- if you wanna, like, talk... ...then I'm here. -What are you doin'? -Just-- just-- It's fine, I'm just consoling you. It's all right. -Just-- just relax. Let it out. Whatever you wanna do. -Barrett. Get off. -Whatever you gotta say. Just open up. -Get off of me. - I don't know how else to do this, man. -Barrett-- What is this? -Not till you open up! There's nothing to let out, Barrett! Jesus! Barrett, please, stop. Please stop! Please. Not till you open up. I'm here for you, man! -Uh, what are you all doing? -Whatever you gotta do... Huh? Oh. Nothing, baby, just wrestling. Okay. Good night. - Good night, sweetheart. - Night, Madi! -Wanna get off this couch? Let's go. -Yep. Levi. Levi. What? If you-- if you're good, man, I'ma... -I'm going to get going. -What do you want me to say? Yeah, I got hospital bills piling up, and I... - I just gotta get back to work, all right? I think I'll have that beer. No, Madi, it's too much. Um, what about my notebook? Oh yeah. Go-- go, grab one. -Hey, meet me back up front! -Okay! Levi? Oh. Hey, Stacey. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Is that the baby? -Yeah. -Can I...? Oh, my goodness! Levi, she is so cute! You know anyone who watches infants? - Uh, Daddy? Who's she? - Huh? This is Ms. Stacey. She works with me at the factory. Oh. - Is this okay? - Yeah, baby, that's fine. It's Madi, right? Yeah. Madi, can you say hi? - Hi. - -It's very nice to meet you. Everyone at work has heard so much about you. Ma'am, I can take you over here. I shouldn't keep you. We can catch up at work on Monday. All right, then. Wait, did you say Monday? - Kelly, please. - -I already told you, we can't. I probably could make space to take Madi, but until Allie is six months old, we can't take her. Yeah, well, I gotta be back at work in four days, so I... What about Ashley's mama and dad? No, I can't with them right now. Okay, have you called Glen Forest? -They're booked. -There's a place over in Clarksville called Sus-Susie-- I can't drive three hours every day just picking them up! And they're booked. Levi, I don't know what to tell you. Have you considered hiring a nanny? -Yeah, right. -It might be your only option at this point. Now, Bobby, you get off of her right now. - How am I supposed to afford a nanny anyway? - I can send you a list of contacts I have right now. Yeah, go ahead and do that, but I gotta let you go. -Okay, I'll send it tonight. -Okay, all right, bye. Stop ringing the damn doorbell! - What are you doing here? - -Do we need an excuse to see our granddaughters? Thanks for ringing the doorbell over and over again. I told you not to. Slow down, girl. Does your daddy feed you? Oh, calm down. Madi, what do you think about you and Allie come to stay with Grandpa and me for a little while? -You can go to church every Sunday-- -Are you kidding me? I already told you no. It would only be temporary until you get back on your feet. -They're not going with you! -Levi, what about your bills next month? -I'm going back to work. I ain't gotta explain myself! -So you have an explanation. -We'll be fine! -I don't think you will, Levi! How did the two of you create something so great as your daughter? -I just don't get it. -You could set money aside! Have you thought of that? Madi, you okay? Yeah, just readin'. Do you wanna go with them? No. Listen, hon, I know it's been tough. Madi, your food's getting cold! Madi, go and eat your food. I'm so tired. I just wanna come cuddle with you, please. - Oh! - Please. As long as you can work around this belly. We don't usually watch 'em that young. Oh, yeah, I-- I understand. -Good luck. -Thanks anyway. Nobody wants to watch you. Hey. Hey. Uh, hey, tonight. Bonfire. Kevin's house. -What do you say? -Yeah, I can't do that. You know I got the girls. Listen, didn't you just text me saying your in-laws were in town? -Barrett, I can't leave 'em. -Dude, cut yourself a break, man, come on now. I'm telling you. Come on out, hang for a little bit. We won't go past your bedtime. I know after midnight, you turn back into a pumpkin. Come on out. It's all right. We're gonna hang for a little while. It's gonna be fun. All right, then, Cinderella, I'll meet you there. - I'm still out there perusing the women. - -Uh-oh. She was like, "You pig, you're just like every other man I met." But I said, "Honey, you ain't never met a man like me." -And it's at this point she left. -Damn it, Kevin. Hey, Kevin, you, uh, you guys ever look at nannies for Bryan? Nah, never really had the need. Her mama just watches him while she works. I tell you what, they are expensive just for looking after a baby. Michelle down at the office told me you're coming back to work on Monday? -That true? -Well... No, he told Mr. Harrell six months. Mr. Harrell heard three months. - Right. - Oh, shit. -Why don't you just ask for an extension? -You know he won't. Which is why I'm looking into the whole nanny thing. But, you know, no one wants to look after a three-month-old. Nanny, huh? Shit, man, I didn't know you had that kinda money. Y'all know anyone who loans money? - Banks. - Oh! Thanks, Barrett. Just resolving all my issues. How about I just waltz into a bank with zero credit and see what they say to me? Oh, oh, I get it, you're being funny. I-- I got it. You know, there is that, um, that farmer guy, uh, in Todd County. You know, the one that-- uh, he loaned money to Rico in finishing a few years back. - Farm guy? - Yeah. Yeah. You got his address? Yeah. Ho-- hold on. It's, uh... Shit, man. Left my Rolodex in the truck. - Sorry. - Oh, you're just an asshole. No, I don't have his address, but you could go ask Rico yourself. Hmm. Levi, I don't really know much about him, but, I mean, anybody that loans money to strangers... Yeah, all right, Barrett. I'm not actually going there, I'm just talking shit. So what do y'all think about this shirt? Good, right? - It's a stupid shirt. - It's not a stupid shirt. Th-That girl I was telling you about, she-- she came up to me and she was like, "Man, those palm trees sure are sexy on you." - Kevin, will you shut him up? - -The girl at the self-checkout? - No, listen, she says-- - James, James, James. - Can I just finish the story, please? - Never. - All right, she says... I am interested... Yeah? Um, I'm here to see Daryl. Come on in. Come on, boy. He's way out back. Daryl! You got a boy here to see you about some money! - Come on over here! - All right? Go on. Pleasure to meet you. Call me Daryl. You want something to drink? No, sir, I'm-- I'm good, thanks. That's a beautiful house you got there. You think so? Yeah, my wife, uh... she likes it. But you know what I like? Only thing on this Earth they ain't makin' more of. Land. That's 235 acres of prime bluegrass. You ever farm? -Yes, sir. -So you know. There's nothing quite like it. Sun on your face, sweat on your brow. How much? -Three thousand dollars. -Three thousand dollars? What you need that kinda money for? Oh. I need a business loan. For a few medical bills and-- and for-- for my girls. -Girls? -Yeah. I got this. Oh! That's their best age. They only get worse. So did you get fired or somethin'? No, I-- I just-- I can't get back to work till I can pay someone to watch the baby. It's the only good-paying job for 200 miles. So where's their mama? She... - Now what kinda bitch could leave a pretty girl like that? See, I told you. They only get worse with age. So let's say I give you this money. What's my guarantee I get my money back? I promise you, I-I'll get you your money back. That's fine. But what's your collateral? -Do you own your house? -Yes, sir. -How many acres? -Two and a half. -Is it a shit hole? -No, sir. -I mean it's nothing like the house you got-- -That's fine. That's fine. Come on, boy. Move your ass. You want something to drink? Go on and have a seat. - Got your license? - Uh, yeah. -This your actual address? -Yes, sir. - What's your daddy's address? - My dad? In case I can't find you, I need next of kin. -Wait, he-- -Boy, you do have a daddy, don't you? Yeah, but he don't really, uh... Wait, um... Wait, what-- what are we doin'? I think, ol', uh, Levi here forgot what the hell we were doing. -I thought you wanted money. -I... Hey, darlin', just wrapping up some business here. Why don't you go and take Mama out by the pool? I'll be out in a sec. I'm gonna wrap up this paperwork here, and I'm gonna give you a check for $5,000. And then in two months' time, you're gonna come back here and you're gonna give me $6,000. -I only asked for three. -Oh, I know what you said. What's your house payment? About 900 a month? So that's $1,800 right there. Then you got bills. Got gas, water, electric. That's another $1,000. Hell, you done blown your $3,000. Then them girls gotta eat. What's that, another 800? Shit, boy, you're closer to that $5,000 than what you think. Now, what's your daddy's address? Yeah, thanks. It's a nice truck you got there! You ain't interested in selling it, are you? No. A man ain't nothin' without his truck. I can respect that. I just worry, you know? Oh, that's a big poopy! I went through his mail, you know? You can't go through his mail! Did you know he's four months behind on his mortgage? He's going to lose this house and end up in a trailer, cashing government checks, like his dad, - bless his heart. - Get out. You about gave me a heart attack. Get out of my house. Levi, is something wrong? Yeah, is it-- that okay? Oh, really? Oh, right, that-- that's great. Oh, that's great. Yeah, it's great news. Yep. No, Madi's just getting home from school right now. Thank you so much. All right then, we'll see you on Monday. - All right. Hey, baby. - Hey, Dad. -Hey, you wanna order pizza tonight? -Seriously? Yeah, seriously. Actually, I think we should make that a, uh, Friday night tradition from now on. What do you think? -Yeah. -Yah! And guess what? -What? -Grandma and Grandpa, they went back to Tennessee. -Why? -Oh, 'cause they had someone else's business to get into down there. Uh-oh! Hey, Levi! Here we go. All right. Hey, sorry I'm late! Work was nuts! -Daddy! -Hey, Madi girl, how you doin'? -Levi. -Oh. Hey, sorry about that. Here, let me-- let me take her. Hey, there's a 20 in my wallet. -Why don't you grab it? -Thank you. Oh, I wanted to say I just changed Allie. She should be fine for a while. - Thank you. - Yeah. Baby. Mwah. -Bye, Madi. -You wanna stay and have pizza with us? Oh, baby, I can't, I gotta go home. -Maybe next Friday. -Okay. -Oh, Levi. -Yeah. -I wanna tell you, Madi's school called again. -Again? Yeah, principal wants you to call first thing Monday. I put a note on the fridge. Okay. Uh, thank you again for staying. I really appreciate it. No problem. -Madi? -Yeah? -Something happen at school today? -No. I told Ms. Wells that I didn't wanna come in from the playground. -That's it? Madi. -Well... I ran away. Mr. Harris had to come get me, and I got sent to the principal's office. -Is that what you wanna hear? -Madi, you have to listen to your teachers! -Why? -Because! That's not a good answer. Well, I don't think you deserve pizza then. -Seriously? -Yeah, seriously. -You know what? You can have some green beans instead. -That's not fair! -Ugh, Madi! -You can't just take things from people! And I don't deserve to lose pizza! -Madi, go to your room! -Ugh! - Oh, come on, please, not you now. God dang it! -I got it! -No, looks like you're struggling to me. There you go. Dang, you're getting pretty fast. - Peek-a-boo. - Peek-a-boo. Oh, where you going now? You-- Oh! Stupid me. Gotta get this thing. Come on. Here, let me show you something. Dad! You know, this merry-go-round was my favorite thing at the park as a kid? You mean this is the same one? Yup. Now hold on tight. -Dad. You can go faster. -Yeah? All right, then. Scoot over! Aah! Whoa! Madi, look up! Look up! Oh, this is the best part. I could spin around and look up and see the sky and trees spinning around me, and I feel like I was the center of the universe. Like I was important. Daddy. -Yeah, baby? -You're important. That's only because I'm your daddy. -Hey, James. -Huh? -Hey, what happened to Rico? -What? -What? -What happened to Rico? Oh! Uh... Think he-- he said he flipped his four-wheeler or somethin', like an amateur. Can never be too careful. Hey, Levi! Yeah? Sir, I've been doing this for a long time, and what we've found is the more involved the parents are in the school life, the better it is for the child. Listen, I am plenty involved in Madi's life. -She got into a fi-- -I understand that, but we are talking about her education. Now, Ms. Collins, we have to fill out this form as the official record of the incident, -before the suspension, at which time we will make-- -What? Suspension? Yes, sir, I thought I made it clear about our "no tolerance" policy. Yeah, yeah, I heard all that, but one fight -and she gets kicked out of school? -That's our policy. I was in dozens of fights before I got kicked out of school. I don't know what to tell you, sir. You can keep my daughter in school. -That's not an option. -Like hell it isn't! Mr. Collins, what do you think you'll accomplish by having a fit?! I understand that in your position this is difficult, but it is our policy. Madison, we have to fill out this form as the official record of the incident, before the suspension, at which time you will be removed from school for two weeks. However, we need to know in your own words what happened. Two weeks, Madi! Two weeks! Uh... -I'm sorry. -I need you to behave, honey. -You can't just keep acting like a child! -Look, I'm sorry. I know you're sorry, but that don't resolve the issue at hand, now does it? This is not how a big girl behaves. You can't just keep acting like you're seven years old! - Daddy. - Let me finish! -But, Daddy! -What?! Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't mean to-- Daddy didn't mean to yell. What'd you want to say? Come on, baby, what did you want to say? I am seven. I mean, there are other older kids at school, and I can try to act like them -if you want me to, but I-- -Oh, no, no, no. - I just... I want you to be yourself, Madi. - Don't, uh, I just want you to-- to be Madi, okay? - So, just-- Hey, next time, don't get caught, all right? You gotta settle somethin', settle it. Just don't get caught. Okay. Oh, hey, y'all! What are you doing here? - Where's Allie? - She's sleeping, darling. - Well... she got kicked out of school. - Ugh. - What happened? - I punched Timothy Morton! How long she out? Two weeks. Yeah, so I'm, uh, I'm on lunch right now, so I gotta-- -I gotta get back. -What-- Levi. -Yeah. -Uh... I don't wanna be that person, but you're only paying me for Allie. I-- I won't charge you double or nothing. I j-- It's just, Madi's got a whole lot more energy to deal with than Allie. Yeah, just hold that thought, okay? Dang! Levi. Yes? You've gotta be more involved with Madi. -I know you're doing your best... -I got it! Put it right there, yeah. Baby, what are you doing up? It's late. I was waiting for you to get home. Yeah, but you need to be getting rest, sweetheart. Hey, Levi. You all right? Y-Yeah, I'm just waiting on my lunch. -Levi. -Yeah, Kevin? Did your daughter attack my son today? Yeah. Tim came home with a black eye. Sorry about that, man. Heard she got suspended. At least there's that. He stole something from her. Yeah, damn Goldfish. So if I take your chips, are you gonna attack me too? I'm not a little boy, though. If your daughter wants to come apologize to my son, you let me know. I'll set up a play date. If she's as dumb as her dad, bitch won't know how to-- Levi! Don't you ever talk about my daughter again! Do you hear me, you fuck?! Do you hear me?! What are you doing here? - I got suspended. - What happened? - I punched Vince Morton! Shit. They accepted? Yeah. We have a house? Yeah. Levi, you got me a house? I mean it's-- it's just a house. We can make a home. We can-- We can put up a tire swing and we can-- Want some Goldfish? Thanks, baby. Are we gonna be okay, Daddy? What do you mean "are we gonna be okay"? I mean, we're all stuck at home. Girl, just because we're home don't mean were stuck here. Hey, don't forget, you still got homework you gotta do. Oh, uh! It's important, honey. Hey, you wanna know something about Daddy that's kind of a secret? Sure. When Daddy was a kid, I really liked school growing up. But I never finished. -You never finished? -Nope. -Why? -Well, your mama, she got pregn-- I got to work with Uncle Barrett at the factory and because of that, I bought us this house for you and your sister to play in. And Daddy's truck. And all the fun stuff we got. Could you go back? -Yeah, I could. -You should! We could go to school together! Baby, it doesn't-- it doesn't work like that. Oh. Well, if I'm gonna finish school, you should too. All right, maybe. I'll be smarter than you, you know? I hope so. You know, your mama, she had great taste. I could eat these all day. Me too. If you haven't signed your child up for soccer, the deadline is fast approaching. The sign-up fee is $60 per child and that does not include shin guards or cleats. Lastly, the first, second, and third-grade field trip is in need of chaperones! It's Thursday the 10th. Food, lunch will be provided for all volunteers. Please see me after. Okay, so that's everything on our formal agenda. Um, so I'd just like to open it up to, uh, the floor here. Does anyone have any new business? Hmm. - You having some trouble there? Yeah. I think last time I was in here, I was probably stealing coffee from the teacher's lounge, so guess I'm still a bit nervous. That's cute. I'm Tessa. -Levi. -Nice to meet you. Are you done? Oh, yeah. Sorry, yeah. It's all right. Uh, um, what brings you here, Levi? Um, my kid goes to school here. Uh, what I meant was, why are you here instead of your wife? Um, we don't really get a lot of men at these things. -Yeah, well, I'm a single dad. -Oh! Single mom. Uh, anyway, what, um-- who's your-- who's your kid? -Madi. -Uh, is that Madi Collins? Yeah. Um, I'm actually-- I'm Timothy Morton's mom. Oh. -Timothy Morton... -Oh. ...the one that your daughter... -Um... -...beat-- got in a fight with. M-Mrs. Morton, uh, Madi's behavior, that-- that's really not like her. And with Vince, I should have been able to control myself. What? What does this have to do with Vince? -He didn't tell you? -No. Look, he, uh... he said some really awful things about my daughter, and, uh, I-I'm not trying to point fingers or nothing, but Vince and I got in a fight. You don't look like you got in a fight. Yeah, it was a-- it was a one-sided fight. Hmm. So I see how it is. Um, so your whole family is just a bunch of bullies, huh? Is that about right? Um... Look, Levi, I'm kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. - God dang it! Gee... - Poke a little fun, uh, it's-- What's wrong with you? You had me shitting bricks there. - That was the point, yeah. - Jeez, really? - All right then, that's all right. - -Sorry, um... Anyway, look, what happened between you and Vince is your business, and when it comes to the kids, they're just kids. It's really not a big deal. And honestly, I'm sorry that she got suspended over it. -Yeah. -Um... Hey, is she gonna be able to come on the field trip? Fi-- oh, um... What-- what day is field trip? It's Thursday. Uh, that makes it the 10th. Uh, yeah. I think that's actually the day she gets back from her suspension. - So, yeah, she should be able to go. - Oh, good. Well, good! That's great. Uh, because we actually need some parent volunteers. If you were available, you should come. -Um... -Maybe? I-- Yeah, all right then, I m-- uh, I'll think about it. That's great! Okay. Great. Um, great. All right, well, I'm gonna go and mingle with the other mamas. And it was great to meet you. And, um... Oh, yeah, so, uh, that packet actually has-- uh, my phone number is in there. Just in case you need anything, you know? -Okay, I gotta go. Bye. -Okay. Bye. It's nice to meet you. There was o-one of the moms there. Anyway, it turned out she-she was-- she's Vince's ex-wife. -Small town. -I know, right? So? So what? Are you gonna go for it or...? Uh, no, man. Barrett-- Barrett. It's-- It's not like that. - All right, but you should do it. -Uh, hey, Barrett, hey, let me, uh... -I'm serious. Let me call you back. I got a call coming in, all right? - All right, man, but you should go f-- Well, hey there, Levi. Hey, Daryl, how you doin'? Oh, pretty good. Just out here grabbing a little after-dinner snack. Not much open this time of night. - Well, uh, I better be getting on home then. All right. Hey, how's, uh, how's things with Madi and Allie? They doing okay? Yeah, they're good. I-- Did I tell you...? Um, I've been workin', um, uh, putting money aside so I can pay you back. Oh, that's good. That's real good. All right, well, I won't keep you. I just, uh, plan on seeing you at my house on the 10th. All right then. Uh, 10th sounds good. All right, you be safe. Wait. What? My daughter, she's got this, uh, this big field trip thing I'm helping out with. You-- you think we could do the 11th? Levi, you-- you ain't tryin' to avoid me, now, are you? - No, sir. - 'Cause I gotta tell ya, I don't... I don't take kind to guys who try to avoid me. Daryl, I promise you I am not trying to avoid you. I gotta haul some cattle this weekend. Let's, uh, let's make it the 13th. I'll be at your house on the 13th. Hmm. - What's the matter? - Oh! Come on. What makes you so special that you get to know and not me? Oh, you don't know why I'm so special? Mm, let me think. Nope, no idea. Levi, you wanna know why I'm so special? Come on, kiddo, we're gonna be late! -Hey, lunches. -Oh, thank you. I'm ready! All right, see you in the evening, okay? -Oh, Levi. Um, I didn't get my check on Friday? -Oh, shoot! Uh, I forgot. -No, it's okay. -No, I could run to the ATM real quick, okay? No, Levi, just get it tonight. Friday, I'll come by and grab it. It-- consider it my going-away present. -Are you sure? -100%. Okay. Uh, hey, let's get it. Come on! - I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too. We'll be leaving in just a few minutes. If you need to use the restroom... ...now is the time. - Well, hey there! - Hey! Wasn't sure I was gonna be seeing you today or not. Oh, well, I-- I know Madi really wanted me to come... All right, everyone, settle down! - Scoot over. - Take a seat. We expect everyone to be on your best behavior at all times. Everyone will be assigned a buddy. -You have a good time? -Yeah. -Hey, you know, what my favorite part was? -Who was that lady on the bus? Uh, just a friend. Trust me, darlin', I-- I ain't never gettin' over your mama. - Hello. - Hey, Levi. Adam. Say, uh, I-- I'm gonna cut to the chase. Um... Susan and I are real sorry about what happened the other day, and, uh, you know, we don't want to be away from you or the girls. Um... We were wondering if, uh, you wanna come out to the house this weekend. I don't know, I got a real important meeting on Monday, Adam. Oh, you know, come on. The girls would like it. It would be a good time. Hey, Madi, you wanna go to Grandma and Grandpa's lake house this weekend? Hmm. Yeah, we'd love to. Come on, girl, jump in! Dad, I don't wanna do this! This is so stupid! What's the worst that's gonna happen? You're gonna get wet? -You're gonna catch me, right? -I promise I'll catch you. Come on. Psych! Wow! - Draw four. Green! - Nice. - Yeah, pick on Levi today, I see. Ugh, go for a five. Reverse back to Madi. -She ain't got no greenies on. -I'm gonna skip Daddy. -Oops. -Oh! - What the-- what did I ever do to you? How many has he got? - Uno! - Un-- Oh, damn, I was gonna get you. Madi, we've got to beat him. - You ain't got-- - Reverse for Grandpa. What? Are you sure you wanna do that, Madi? -Sure. -You sure now? -Sure. Why you asking me? -Okay. - What can I say? I'm the best! - Oh, man! -You cheated! -Grandpa's got it going on! Yes! Madi, don't ever reverse it back to the guy with Uno. I didn't know he was gonna cheat! Come on, Madi, let's go to the lake while it's still warm. - Oh, yeah! - Be nice. Come on, kid, let's go. Thank you for coming out here, Levi. Yeah, it's been really nice. I... have... a proposition for you. I'm not trying to take your girls. I'm offering help with your finances. I can show you how to balance a budget. Maybe Adam can show you some things around the house. -Susan, we're good. -Levi, don't get defensive. You see that girl out there? You helped her overcome her fear of the water in moments. And you are raising a newborn baby by yourself. Levi. You're not a bad dad. I'm not trying to say that. I just wanna make sure Ashley's girls are taken care of. Okay. I'll think about it. - Sorry. - It's all right. Okay. Okay. Detroit Trojans take on the number three seed, Little Rock Trojan. Homers and fifth in RBI. 3-2 pitch. Ball hit deep to right field. Our first home run of the tournament. Way out of here! Clears the bullpen and into the parking lot. An absolute bomb on the bat of Riley Whitman. Home run number 14! And Little Rock has the early 1-0 lead. Now Chris Curry said he was one of the first signees that they had when he was here and loved to see the fact that they're gonna have some success at the end of their careers. We mentioned him being a senior... Come on, boy. Okay? -Steven. -You all right there? Why don't you go shut that baby up? Go, boy! It's okay. It's okay. Oh, God. Come here. Come here. Come on, boy. Sit. Do you know what today is, Levi? The 12th? Harry, what time is it? It's 1:22, Daryl. It's the 13th. -We rescheduled for today. -Oh, I know, I know. But you're home and... here we are. Remember when I told you, Levi, I don't, um... I don't like when people try to avoid me and... I was beginning to think you were trying to avoid me. Daryl, I have your money. Great, great. So why'd you push it off? You know, imagine my surprise when Steven gives me a call and says he didn't see your truck here when he was driving home from work. So... Levi, you owed me $6,000... But you missed it. Oh, should we say rescheduled it for three days later? Now that's a 30% charge, per day of course, for a total of $13,182. Daryl... I don't have the 13 grand. And you told me we could reschedule. He told you to sit down, you dumb son of a bitch. - Oh, I know we rescheduled, but there's still a charge. It's in that contract we agreed to. Now it's either that or I'm taking this house. And I don't care which, because a contract is a contract. Now, I feel for you, Levi, I really do. But if you ain't got it, then you need to sign this. -Daryl. -Sign it, Levi. - It'd be a shame for those girls to grow up without a daddy. Wait. What about my truck? What was that you said? "A man ain't nothin' without a truck"? Yeah, I know what I said. Harry, go check it out. Sounds like it starts right up. It's in pretty good shape. All right, Levi, $6,000 and the truck. What? My truck's worth at least 15 by itself. Listen, I don't give a shit what you think! You owe me money, boy, and that's a decision you made on your own free will. Now you choose these next words wisely, because, boy, it's late and I'm real tired. Okay, okay. Wonderful. Count it. - Thank you. - Hey, honey. Ooh. -Hey! -He's 600 short. I need my $600 and I ain't talkin' about tomorrow, Levi. Just-- just let me grab my girls and I'll go to the ATM. No, no, no, no, no, no, ain't no need of wakin' them up. And what's my guarantee that you don't run off with the truck and them girls without signing this paper first? -Daryl. -But I'm gonna get my money. -I can't. -Then sign the damn paper, Levi! Okay. Come on! Come on! Just a fucking piece of shit. Levi, get up. Stop it. Come on, get up. - Levi! - What do you want? Allie is crying. Oh, there she is. It's okay, Mama. Oh, yes, I-- I got you, baby. I got you, baby. It's okay. Yeah, yeah, rock-a-bye baby, all right. - Hey, Dad. - Yeah, baby? You gonna walk me to the bus? Oh. Yeah, honey, just go get ready, all right? - Okay, I'm sorry that rash is bad. Oh. Ash, you cannot be lifting those boxes. Oh, it's not that heavy. - Like hell, it isn't. I'm not gonna have you and Madi get hurt in this house, okay? Hey, this house ain't gonna be like the one that you had. - I know that. - Well, you better. I'll get her. All right. Hey, I love you. You know that? I hope so. - Hello? - Is this Mr. Collins? -Yeah. -Mr. Collins, this is First Sun Bank. -We're calling about-- -Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know. That-- that-- that was me. I-- I, uh, I know it's a large amount. -I took it out of the ATM last night. -No, sir. We are calling about your mortgage. Mr. Collins? You have no fucking idea what I've been through! Mr. Collins, we've made every attempt to contact you. We've sent you letters, we've made phone calls. Look, I've talked to you all about this. There is no way we're six months behind on our mortgage. -Mr. Collins. -I understand, we're behind. But... I'm telling you, it ain't been six months. Look at it. Ch-Check your notes. Okay. Last payment, April 15. First missed payment, May 15. Mr. Collins... I'm gonna spell this out plainly for you. You're six months behind on your mortgage. We've made every necessary attempt to try to contact you. After this month, it will be seven months, leaving you with a balance of $7,482.19... ...which will need to be paid in full on the 15th. Two days. Or we will repossess your house. Back to the wall... Hey, Dad, what's for dinner? Uh... there's some chips in the kitchen, baby. ...off a couple pitches down in the strike zone... Madi? Madi? Madi! Madi, what are you doing in here? It still smells like Mommy in here. Oh, Madi. Hey. Daddy, why is she gone? Why did she have to die? Baby, I know. I know, it's all right. It's not fair that she had to die. I know, I know. Allie isn't even gonna meet her! Mommy belonged to us. It's not fair! You can't just take things that don't belong to you! -I know. -Daddy, I don't... -Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. -I don't... - Baby, you can ask Daddy for help, okay? It's okay to ask for help. Okay? It's okay. All right? Shit, Levi, how far behind are you? Six, going on seven months. How could you not know? Yeah, I... I knew, I just... Ashley does all the finances and I... I didn't think we were that far behind. What are you gonna do? I mean... You got anything saved up or...? Yeah, I mean... I ain't goin' back to work for four weeks, and I ain't got my truck. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean you don't have your truck? Uh... i-it's in the shop. It's in the shop. The truck's in the shop, of course. Damn, Levi. Uh... -Mm. What? -Barrett. Wait, no, no. D-Don't even tell me you're sick too. -Are you sick or something? -What? No, man. Look... No, you were about to say something. Nothing. Levi, come on, man. God, I was gonna-- Ugh! I'm asking you for money. Barrett. I'm asking you for help. Please, I-- I can't-- I can't lose my house, Barrett. My dad lost his house, and we had to move constantly. -I know. I know. I know. -My girls can't lose the house. My family built this house! Levi, okay, listen carefully. I don't have that kind of money. Have I ever asked you for anything, Barrett? -Hey, Levi, now don't be like that, man. -Have I? -No, come on, Levi. -We're gonna lose the house. Please! I can't give you something I don't have! I mean... - You know what? - Just get out then. -Wait, what? -Barrett, just get out. -Wait, so I don't loan you 7,000-- -Barrett, get out of my house! What...? All right. That's weird, all right. Hi, you've reached Adam and Susan. We're not home right now, but if you'll leave a message-- I'm so sorry. I'm going to bed, Dad. All right, good night, sweetheart. Hey, Dad? Yeah. Yeah, baby? Well... What is it? Could you read me a book? I don't know some of the words. Yeah. Of course, sweetheart. "It was dawn. The lark sang and the apple buds blossomed on the merry May morning." Primroses crowned the hedges and wind played in the trees." Robin whistled as he walked." I'm sorry. Baby, what are you doing up? It's late. I was waiting for you to get home. You need to be getting rest, sweetheart. Well, I'm fine, but you are nasty! You wanna take my friend? You wanna take my best friend? I hope you plan on taking a shower before you come to bed. Oh, baby, come on, please, I've had such a long day. I'm so tired. I just wanna come and cuddle with you, please. - Oh! - Please. You know what I found out today? What's that? I know the sex of the baby. You wanna take my home? You wanna take my girl? That was today? You cannot remember a thing, can you? - No! - -So am I getting a boy this time? - Is that all you're worried about? What makes you so special that you get to know and not me? Oh, you don't know why I'm so special? You wanna take my best friend?! No! No! Don't! Don't! No! You won't! Oh, baby, I'm sorry. No! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No! Don't! Don't! I'm so sorry. I just need help. I just need help. I need help. - Barrett. - Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's with the bat, man? You look like shit. Truly. Uh... it's not easy for me to say this. Um... I don't know how you're gonna react. Barrett, what is it? Just take it. -Just take it. -No, I shouldn't have even asked. -Levi. -Barrett, I said no. Look, I know you got this weird thing about... Barrett, I can't take this from you. You think all this is from me? Hey, Levi. Hey, guys. Now, I can't force you to do this. So here we stand. Come here. -I promise I'm gonna pay y'all back. -Uh, Levi, it's a gift, man. -Stop. -Barrett, I cannot accept this. Levi, it's a gift, okay? Look, we ain't get you a wedding present anyway. All right, then. Y'all wanna come inside? Second one up, good. Long, his first point of the second half, he's got 15. Collin Harris has 22 to lead the Tigers... You know, Levi... I think you're gonna be all right, man. Damn, James, you can't read a situation for shit. -Who are you, Dr. Phil, bro? -What? -Come on. -You're playing with your Lego. I thought we were having a moment! Shit! -I felt the moment. -Sorry. -No, we could just sit-- we could just-- -Okay. -We could just watch the game in silence. -Yep, I got it. - We could just... - -Referee is calling for a towel to, uh, wipe up the sweat. We're gonna have a timeout... Thank you, guys. It'll be a full timeout. We'll take one too. - 5:16 left here in the second half. Campbellsville 73, McKendree 56. Yeah, gonna get your crazy daddy on the straight-and-narrow, I promise you that. You gonna help me watch over your daddy? You good? All good. Now look here, I ain't tryin' to be your mama or nothin', but you gotta learn to control your money better, because you can never end up in this type of mess again. Okay, go. I'm not even gonna apologize or nothing. Don't know what you're waiting for. You're the closest thing to a brother I got. I can't have you being broke all the time, man. Barrett, you have a real brother. Yeah, but... can't stand his ass. Yeah, me neither. One hit of the hockey stick, that's all it takes... - Hello? - Susan? Hey, Levi. Hey, um, you know, I was thinking about it and, uh, you think I can take you up on that offer? Sure can. Great. You think we can come by your house weekend after next? Yeah. We can make that happen. All right, then. "This is the house that Jack built. This is the malt that lay in the house that Jack built. This is the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built. This is the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that..." Dad, Allie isn't paying any attention! Honey, I'm kinda busy ri-- All right. All right. I know someone else who didn't like books as a baby. I've always loved books. Yeah, but when you were a baby, we tried, tried, and tried, and just couldn't get you to pay attention. But your mama, she had this trick and it really worked. "That tossed the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat." Still works. So you and Mama talked to me like that every time you read to me? Yeah. I mean, eventually you-- you got older, and we read to you normally, and then you started reading by yourself. -Hey, Dad? -Yeah, baby? When I get older, can you help me remember all the stuff Mama did? Of course. What about Allie? Her and Mama didn't even know each other. Baby, Mama knew who Allie was before you and I even got to meet her. She took care of her and made sure she was healthy, and she even slept with her every night. Hey, I tell you what. When Allie gets older, we're gonna make sure she knows exactly who Mama was, okay? Okay. Know my girls. Now, chicken. Make sure it doesn't burn. Just going to get a nice sear, a nice brown... Oh, yeah. Gosh. There you go. Madi, what are you doing up? Allie woke me up. Could I sleep with you? Yeah, sure, baby. That's fine. So am I getting a boy this time? Is that all you're worried about? No! Come on. What makes you so special that you get to know and not me? You don't know why I'm so special? Mm, mm, let me think. Nope, no idea. It's because without me, you wouldn't have these girls.
