Where'd you find it? -Looks pretty old. -It found me. It was dawn and there was nobody awake except me, and I could feel something was about to happen. I did a tour of the palace, and then, on an impulse, I went into the throne room. Hey, I hope you didn't sit on the throne. That's absolutely not allowed. No, I didn't sit on it. Chaca told me I'll be able to one day, but as far as for now is concerned... -You can't. -Right. So tell us what happened, eh? Well, I walked up to the throne, and as I ran my hand over the back of it, this mechanism went off and revealed a secret niche. The parchment was inside. It's in ancient dinosaur.

I wish I could, but I don't know how to use them. Just concentrate and send it by telepathy. Just like it was a letter. Let me think. Something like, "Today we're not going to go to school because I'm dead on my feet." The point is, you let them now, and then give them the details when you get back.

Right, but there are still two missing. The parchment says five. Don't forget the one who has the cross the unknown lands. One could be the leader of the pterodactyls. What about the commander of the mammoths? Who else? I think Mutti would make a great knight. Oh, right. But we're still one short. That's enough. Be quiet! ♪ Now kneel before me.

Don't forget that my salvation is part of your destiny! Please hurry, my lord! Did you do it? Hey, how did it go? Have you found out where Aurora is being held? Did you see her? Speak with her? -What's the next move, Rakhal? -What do we do? Hey, calm down. Easy. There's no time to waste. I'll tell you all about it on the road.

Class A gastropod assigned to Lord Braveheart, who's entrusted me with a dispatch. Our troops are surrounded by the enemy in Eagle Pass to the north of the city. They're still holding out, but they need reinforcements ASAP. Rakhal, don't worry, my boy. Gastropods are notorious liars. -Really? -Yes. Hey, who are you calling a liar, huh? The situation is desperate. If that's so, we must do something on the double. We must deploy the army, call up the reservists, and hasten to save the day! If I set out right away with Sluggard, gastropods are as fast as lightning. I'll be there in a flash, in time to come to the rescue of Lord Braveheart.

I'm proud of you, men. You are an invincible army. Three cheers for Prince Rakhal! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hut, hut! My compliments, Lord Braveheart, for your brilliant victory. Thank you, Your Excellency, but actually it was my snail's doing. Without his intervention, we wouldn't be so lighthearted now. Giving credit where credit is due deserves a little lightheartedness. We'll make camp here for tonight, Rakhal. Good idea. Lord Braveheart's troops need time to rest and recuperate. ♪ ♪ That bird looked like it was spying on us. Sire! That fowl carrion eater is Maya's personal assistant. Tell Captain Rodat to pursue it, and find out where it comes from. At once, my liege.

Did you see Maya? I did, sir. Thank you, Captain. They're deployed in a single army. I have a plan that will allow us to repulse the enemy before they attack us. We'll divide our troops into two groups. One will fight on the ground, and the other will fight in the air. Now I'll brief you on the details. I will lead the airborne group that will include Chaca, Myellin, Cordall, the small knights, and the knights of the air and the light. Lord Braveheart will command the ground troops. Advance in battle formation. And as soon as you sight the enemy positions, make them retreat in disorder with sustained attacks.

If you agree, I'll lock Maya and her perfidious princes of evil in a cave at the center of the world and I'll surround them with a huge band of energy fueled by all the goodness in the universe. Curse you! I'll get out of here. Good will be their guardian, and they'll stay there as long as the peoples of the world respect goodness. Thank you, Aurora. The whole world will be eternally grateful for everything you've done for us today. The time has come to depart. My lord, you must complete your mission without any more delays.
