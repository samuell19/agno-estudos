Despite some encouraging economic news today, not all working Americans are feeling a positive impact. Many millennials are still struggling financially, especially when compared to past generations. Let's bring in my good friend George "Tyrus" Murdoch... Millennials blame Baby Boomers for ruining their lives. Fifty-one percent of millennials surveyed by... ...the "Burn Out" generation, with the stress caused by several factors like anxiety, work ethic... Millennials: Are they just having a negative overall impact on this economy? ...debt in this country has topped $1 trillion. No appreciation for the work ethic. There's also a lack of skills. ...of the recent college graduates are getting jobs... ...worried about these home invasion robberies happening... Is this the next financial crisis? They don't even have a clear picture of the gunmen's faces, minus the masks... In all, Chicago police have issued two community alerts. Now police need your help finding them. Definitely want to catch up with this crew. - I'm in. - Throw this on before you get out. - Says you're joining us. - You are new here... - You trust me? - Don't you think you deserve... - Lance. - Lance. Lance. I want to thank you for agreeing to talk with me. With this book, you will have the opportunity to tell your story, from your point of view. Can you give that to me? I can give you my point of view, but I can't guarantee you'll understand it. Why is that? Bit of a generation gap. You're right. I've got a few years on you. I think you'll find me up to speed. But I really, really want to learn something along the way. You can help me bridge that gap. Okay. Okay. When did this all begin for you? With a train ticket to Chicago. I'll never forget how much that ticket cost. Hey, Mom. Yes, I made it safe. No, Jack's picking me up. He said he put in a good word, it'll be fine. All right, I love you. Bye. Hey, Lance. - Hey, Jack! - What's new, baby boy? - Man, it's good to see you. - What's going on? Good to see you. You're looking good. Give me this stuff. Let's get out of here. - Thank you, man. - Of course. Oh, my God! Thanks for picking me up. Come on, what, do you think I'm gonna make you walk? I can't believe you drive a Porsche. Yeah, man, it does the trick. So, how's everyone back in Dixie? They're good, man. They miss you. If they miss me that much, they can come up and visit me once in a while. That's true. How's life been treating you, post-college? - It's been rough. - Why is that? I mean, I can't even tell you how many job interviews I've struck out on since I graduated school. I'm looking for someone with real-world experience. - Never worked in an art gallery? - This is a highly competitive intern position. - You are way too qualified for this. - If anything changes... - Gonna give you some valuable... - We'll keep your resume on file. Wouldn't you be happier in your own field? I hear you. Job market was kicking my ass too, but that's why I took matters into my own hands. It's just a start-up, but, like, you'll be doing what you love, - I think you'd be perfect for it. - Thank you, Jack. I know it's been like three years or something, but I've been keeping my eye out for you. I saw on Facebook that you graduated and I was like, "Shit, who better to ask than my own cousin?" I didn't even know that you were involved in art. Well, I mean, it's not really about the art. Just pays well. Well, then, what's the business? How about no more questions, hmm? Tonight's for catching up, man. - I'll lay everything out tomorrow. - Come on, Jack. - What? - What do you mean, what? You told me to come all the way here - and you won't tell me anything? - All right, fine. You'd be working in acquisitions. - Acquisitions. - Mm-hmm. - I like that. - Good! Acquisitions. Yeah. And just know that from now on, your troubles are officially over. Thank you, man. Seriously. Jack had always been ahead of the curve, so I made it my goal to learn all that I could from him. Lesson #1: It's all about who you know. Come on in. Drop your shit anywhere. Couch is all yours. Come on, let's go! - Where are we going? - Downstairs. Man, you're really going to love your co-workers. Guys, open up! - Jack, is that your truck? - Yeah, one of them. Chill! Are you done? Yeah, I'm done. - I swear you're a child. - Oh, don't act like you didn't miss me. Lance, this is Allie, the lady of the house. - Hey, Lance. - Hey. That's Stewart, Chandler, and that's Ellis. - What's up, bro? - Hey. Take a seat. Thank you. $500 buy-in. You in? Oh, no. Guys, I don't have 500 bucks to blow on a poker game. Jack says you're joining us tomorrow. Yeah, he is. Just a trial period. Spot him the five, he's good for it. Family, right? Jack, Jack... where we going, man? Picking up and moving a new piece. Why you looking like that? You trust me, right? Come on. I hope you know art like he says you do. Yeah. You know enough not to get your clammy hands all over the art, right? Oh yeah, throw this on before you get out. So, are you in or not? Yeah, I'm in. I was absolutely speechless. I mean, they were breaking into these homes in broad daylight, and they would just make a sport out of it. They would steal anything of value, and then just destroy the rest for fun. I mean, these guys were true artists of destruction. They could tear down what took someone else years to build up. It's very poetic. But who were they? Let's start with Chandler Gaines and Stewart Magenty. Chandler was the getaway driver. He served a short stint in Afghanistan that fucked him up pretty badly. While some US veterans thought they had left the worst of the war behind, only to discover the war came home with them. And he came home and couldn't even find a factory job. Twenty-six percent of vets between the ages of 18 and 24 are out of work. He felt rejected and lost. Just around that time, he got a call from an old buddy. Stewart was the security expert: alarms, cameras, safes. I mean, he could get past anything. He'd moved to Silicon Valley with big dreams but learned the hard way that most people don't make it. The unemployment rate of the Silicon Valley area is 8.5% higher than the national average. Then he got stuck working in the nerd squad at one of those big electronic chains. This may not be the image that comes to mind when you think of Silicon Valley, but it's a scene that's become all too familiar here. - What do you think it's worth, art major? - Next is Allie Tucker. She made sure the message was clear. She was the glue that kept the whole group together. Her and Ellis started dating in college, where they were both activists. - Occupy! - Wall Street! - Occupy! - Wall Street! And at first, it was just the two of them. Kind of a Bonnie and Clyde, but with a message. Here is Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker who died as they lived: by the gun. We've got to win by building a new civil rights movement that's prepared to fight by any means necessary. And Ellis Beck was the puppeteer. His philosophy was simple: Why try to work for a system that's failed you so horribly? The richest 1% controls more wealth now than at any time in more than a half century. And he believed that we were the wake-up call that the system needed. So, that's what they did, and they did it well. They'd gotten away with it long enough to get incredibly efficient at it. Lesson #2: When the system is corrupt, why play by their rules? - I got you. - You got it? How long is the drive? 45 minutes. Jack. Your cousin. Lance. Let's go, man. And Mel Donnelly is how they made money. Where's the rest? We almost got everything on your list. You got 15 minutes. Mel owned a shipping container company in the city, completely legit business. But every now and then, he'd fill up one of those containers with stolen goods, ship it overseas, and make an extremely large amount of cash. - Got it? - Yep. Right there. There was supposed to be a couple of Van Goghs and an emerald bracelet. - Just one Van Gogh. - Just one? Yeah, but the bracelet's in there, plus a few other things that weren't listed. We also got the mail and a couple of passports. Hmm. So, he's with you? Yeah. Does he know that? He's an art major, helps us tell us what art is valuable and what's not. Plus we need the extra hand. He's cool, Mel. He's my cousin. Oh, that's supposed to make me feel better, that he fell out of your family tree? Hello. What, you find me attractive? - I, what? - Well, you won't look at me. That means either you're not into what's going on here, or my good looks are making you uncomfortable. The first. Uh-huh. You add someone without asking me and bring him to my place of business? I didn't see anything. Oh, yeah, you did. You say one word to anyone... I dare you. Comprende, cousin? Here's another address, and a list of what I expect you to find when you go there. When you buy homeowner's insurance, anything particularly valuable has to be listed separately, photos, certificate of authenticity, proof of purchase... so basically the insurance companies know what everybody has. Smile. All you need is one dirty agent and... and that's where Mel comes in. Mel had a place to sell everything, and he paid extremely well. Even with the smaller loads, the mail usually made up the difference. Yeah, well, I'll round it up to 30K. But you better make it up to me next time. Credit cards, social security numbers, bank account numbers... and they all knew what he did with those. What's your name? Lance. Lance? Lance what? Zutterland? Are you asking me? Don't show up here again unless you're going to pull your weight. Lock it up when you're done. Aw, come on, man, really? Again? - Thirty split five ways is six. - And we get four? You wouldn't know what to do with this shit if it wasn't for my guy. And you couldn't do without us, so fuck you. You know, we got eight minutes. Let's wrap it up. Bullshit. Fucking piece of shit. I'm sick of loading shit up. Yeah, yeah, I got it, come on. What's wrong with this guy? - I think we spooked him. - He'll be fine. I get it, but you wouldn't have come. Of course I wouldn't have, that was fucked up! Okay, I don't want anything to do with this, seriously. Here's your cut. Actually, half of mine. The guys didn't think you deserved anything since you stood there with your thumb up your ass. - But you're family, so I'm willing to cut you some slack. - Cut me slack? I came all the way out here because you told me you had a legit job offer for me. The family in the house we robbed? They're the reason you can't get a legit job. - What are you talking about? - You're focusing on the wrong part of this. Come out with us tonight. I'll tell you what this is really about. - I know what this is really about. - God, Lance, nobody is forcing you to do it again, okay? Just stop, you got a place to stay, couple bucks in your pocket to help you look for a legit job. I'm not touching that money, Jack. I don't want anything to do with this! - Okay, fine. - I'm serious! Okay, I know you're serious. You don't have to touch the money. Lance, come on, stop. Look at me. Hey... I'm sorry, okay? I should have told you. But it's done. You did it already, so you might as well enjoy it. And plus, it's cocktail night tonight. Kind of a big deal. - Come on. - Where did they take you? Where they went after every heist. - He okay? - Yeah, he's fine. He's just shell-shocked. - He's with us, isn't he? - Fucking better be after the shit he's seen. - Just do your pitch and reel him in. - They celebrated, and blowing through most of what they made wasn't uncommon. I mean, their money didn't go towards savings or 401(k)s. What did they spend it on, then? Instant gratification. They thought the well would never dry up. So, easy come, easy go. Exactly. Even though I said no to the money, I did the math. It would have taken me three weeks and two days working those 12-hour shifts at an art gallery to make as much as what Jack had offered me after the first hit. And they were doing these a few times a week. Hey, Lance, take a seat. Lance, I want to thank you for entertaining all of us. What am I entertaining? How much do you owe in student loans? $60,000. Fuck me. Wow. I owe $120,000. Why did you borrow? - What do you mean, why did I borrow? - Why'd you borrow? Because I couldn't afford school, that's what you do. What were your grades? 3.8. Mine were 4.0. Don't you feel cheated? We fucking did everything that they told us to do. We got the grades, we got to the end of the line. For what? What was waiting there, hmm? Fucking nothing, no bueno, no good. Nothing, no job. Yeah, but still, you're stealing from people. Fuck the people. Fuck 'em. The insurance company covers what that shit is worth. They pay double for it. Listen, everybody knows very few people have all the wealth, and they like to keep it that way. Each generation it gets worse and worse, ours being latest. We're not just stealing... we're sending a message. Woo! Look at this. Look at all that. Don't you think that you deserve all of this? Don't you think that you deserve all of this? Hey, take one of these puppies. - Hey, come on. - What is it? Our generation's drug, man. Guarantee he's not going to do it. Aw, give him a sec. Lesson #3: Never take no for an answer. Hey, Lance, welcome to cocktail night. Ever done this before, Lancey-pansey? So, you do it through your eye. How do you get that clean line? I can never do a fucking clean line. You've always been sloppy. I got to do it for Lance. This is all you, baby boy. It won't work, man! Nah, he's fine. Have I got it on my face still? Big one. Oh! A good time, huh? You guys want to stay in here longer? It smells great. Let's go. I wasn't sure if I was sold on what Ellis was saying yet, but I did know this: for once in my life, I felt like I was part of something. I wasn't the outsider anymore, I was accepted. We blew through most of that money that night, but for a moment, we were kings. Lesson #4: Experiences are better than bank statements. By the time the money ran out, they were already gearing up for the next hit. And as reckless as the hits seemed, they were actually thought out pretty carefully. Like the truck... I mean, they ordered six or seven sample decals just so that they would change them from one hit to the next. Eyewitnesses and street cameras were less likely to ID the same truck. And the truck's license plates were another thing. How many people actually know their license plate numbers by heart? Most wouldn't even notice until next time they were at the DMV. And if someone sees a shitty car in a nice neighborhood, I mean, someone's going to be suspicious. But a nice car in a nice neighborhood? No one thinks twice. After Mel gave them the address, they'd spend a day or two casing the place, making sure they knew when the homeowners left for work, when the maid showed up, when the husband came home with his mistress. All the good stuff. Once Jack laid this all out for me, I realized he actually had a point. They'd been doing this for a while without getting caught, and the money was good. All I had to do was put away my moral objections. You know, Lance, you're a pretty good kid. And I'd like to offer you a job, minimum wage. You're not going to get rich doing this. But if you stick to it, you're going to learn a lot about the art world. And there's a lot of room to grow. You just need to focus, get involved, learn what you can, and this is a great place for you to begin. The masks were the final touch to their message, that they'd rather be dead than submit to the system. When Lance decided to join, I knew then that he would never fit our mold. Honestly, he was the hardest to figure out. What does that mean? Welcome to the group, baby boy. Yo, Slim, pull me up. Well... what you go for first says everything about you. You go for the furniture, pictures, Dad's golf trophies, Mommy's wine set. Everyone had their own thing. Stewart always went for the glass. He liked to think of himself as a bull in a china shop. Stewart got picked on a lot as a kid. He wasn't a bull at all. He was just... insecure. Jack had this thing for family pictures. He couldn't stand them. Especially the fake happy ones. Jack had mommy and daddy issues. They didn't give a shit about his businesses. They didn't even visit him once since he moved to Chicago. He felt neglected and abandoned. When he was destroying someone else's life... I think he felt in control. Chandler hated seeing a kid's room full of toys. Chandler had nothing as a kid except maybe a beating from his dad when he got drunk and pissed off that he couldn't provide for his family. Breaking into someone's house would make anyone feel violated. But messing with a kid's room... that's what messed the parents up the most when they'd come home. That shit was fucked up. Ellis never knew his parents. He went from foster home to foster home until he turned 18. He always wanted a family. And because of that, he was the thread that brought them all together. He gave this group of misfits something to believe in. For me, I couldn't stand the vanity of it all. Cologne, perfume, suits, dresses, makeup, Tom Ford, Gucci, Prada. More and more excess, excess. You said that Lance was hardest to figure out. Why? He didn't fit in, because he wasn't scarred by his past like the others. He was just someone who had followed the rules and got screwed over. In a way, he understood Ellis' ideas better than anyone. So, when he had the chance to destroy, he saw it as an art form. It had meaning. I think most people deep down want to do what we did. But Lance let himself go all-in. It became his addiction. The excitement, the thrill. He loved it. When I finally gave in, it was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had. I remember looking up at that house, and as it towered over me it made me feel so small. And that's how the people who live there wanted me to feel. And I realized that's why they deserved this. Lesson #5... you know what, actually, fuck that. They weren't lessons anymore, they were rules. Rule #5: If they won't let us dream, we won't let them sleep. I don't know what I was feeling at that point. I just know it felt right. Maybe we were all in it for different reasons, but for me it was about the rush, the high. - It all felt like... - Stop! Bring that over here. Someone want to explain this? Must have ripped when we were loading it. I'm sorry, is that your explanation? Hey, Zutterland. What's this worth? I mean, it's insured for probably 100K. Could flip it for around 60? Yeah. What's it worth now? Probably cost more to repair it than what it's actually worth. So, nothing, right? Lance, let's talk. You know, you're part of this now. Plausible deniability was over two houses ago. Yeah, I understand that. Take a look at me, tell me what you see. A businessman. Someone 20 years older than you. I lead a comfortable life, but I have a lot less left of it than you do. So... So you don't want to spend what's left of it in a cell. Exactly. It's about risk, reward. All that aside, I'm sure you alone amongst your cohorts over there might have a little compassion for that piece of destroyed history, so I want to ask you to help me keep these kids in line. Can you do that for me? Yes, sir. Great. You don't got to call me sir. This is 20K and another address. You think your old man ever held 20K in his hand? No. Yeah, me neither. You know what? Don't tell them what I said. - You know they're going to ask. - Oh, of course they will. But, you see, that's what I'm doing, I'm giving you the upper hand. I'm giving you a secret. You got to keep it from them, see what happens. Another address, Mel? Yeah, I gave it to Lance. Cut rate for the ripped art. When you're finished, get out. You bring me a piece in that condition again, we're done here, you hear me? What did Mel say? Told you, dude, he said it's a secret. Ah, man, he just playing you. He told me the same thing when I first came on. Just another reason why this shit won't last. Luckily, I got a way out. What did you just say? I said, this isn't going to last. But what I'm saying is I have a way out. Mel isn't the only one that's been buying addresses from that insurance agent. Ellis bought their most expensive client. Some paranoid old fuck sitting on an ungodly amount of cash. - Cash? - Enough to last a lifetime. Ellis only sees it as a last resort kind of thing. That's why my plan is to hit it without him. Without Ellis. Without anybody. What are you talking about, Jack? We have something good going here. Why do you want to screw this all up? What is good about Ellis getting more money than us on every house, hmm? We don't have to do this today, but we got to get his phone and the pictures so we're ready when the time comes. Jack, you're saying "we" like I'm already a part of this. This is us having enough money to get out of here before it's too late. No, this is us completely fucking everybody else over! Man, I thought these guys were your best friends. You made this huge deal of introducing them all to me saying how much I would love them and... These guys do not give a shit about friends. They just don't. All right, Jack, no more bullshit. What do you want from me? Am I here because you guys want to use me for my art expertise? Do you want me so you can fuck over your friends? What is it? Because you have not been honest with me since I got here. I'm being honest with you right now. These guys think you're some art kid who likes doing weird shit, who likes going to his little theater plays and his little art galleries. You don't owe them anything. I'm looking out for you. It is just you and me on this. I don't know, man. All right, all right, throw them down. Oh, throwing it down big, baby boy. - What you got? - Throw 'em down. - Pair of threes. - Oh! - Almost, baby boy, almost. - So confident. We should go... Caitlyn's always on time. No, think I'm going to stay. I already told them you were coming. Plus if you go, you lose big. You should take Lance. What, he hasn't left my apartment since he got here. You should take Lance. That okay with you? Yeah, I mean, you'd be doing him a favor. Lance, you want to come hang out with me and my old college friends. Nah, I'm all right. And it'd be kind of weird, right? Why would it be weird? Hmm? - No, I was saying that... - It'd only be weird if there was something - going on between you two. - Oh, my God. Is there something going on between you two? - No, there's nothing... - You're stuttering on your fucking words - like there's something going on. Hang on. - Sounds like there might be... Are you sure? - This is fucking stupid. - Oh, he's getting a little red in the face. You got a little boner going on there? - He's got a little boner. - We're all friends here. If we can't trust each other, who can you trust? - Just go with her, come on. - You should go. Because if you're not, I might go. Is that cool? - You're not invited. - Is that cool, Ellis, can I go? You're not worried about me, are you? - Just go. We're all friends, go on. - All right, I'll go. - Yeah! All right. - Let's go. - See you back later? - See you back later. I hope this is good with you. I'm in need, in definite need. - Wait, who's small, who's big? - I think you are. I haven't talked to Caitlyn in a while, so when she called I was really curious to see what she's been up to. Why has it been so long? We're into different things. - Hi! How are you? - Hey. - This is Lance. Ellis got tied up. - Hi. We have a table. - Nothing prepares you for how much work it is having a kid. - It's worth it. - I forgot to show you Tibet. - My God, this is beautiful. That looks like a village we stayed at in Haiti. I jumped into the start-up right after... It's not exactly a dream job yet, but we're getting there. What about you, Allie? Um... Where do I even start? Africa, mostly. I got a group of ten investors together to help develop an affordable option for clean water. That's amazing! How about you, Lance? I own an art gallery. Okay, I know I took it a little bit far, but I had to. Didn't you hear all the stuff they're doing? - They only told you the good stuff. - What? They only told you the good stuff. No one actually tells you what they're really doing in life. You're probably as close to the truth as they were. It didn't seem that way. Hey, what about that art gallery that you own, then? Oh, come on, you started it. How was it? Where is everyone? They just left. What's up? - Thanks for hanging out. - Yeah. You going back to Jack's? Yeah, I think I'm going to call a cab right now. Thanks again. Hey, Lance, take a seat. Nah, man, I'm going to go back to Jack's. No, no, no, take a seat. We can talk about what we spoke about the other night. Okay. You know, uh... I didn't think that you were going to make it. But you, you seem all right. I think that when you learn where to stick your nose, and where not to, I think you'll be a good fit. - Thanks. - Mm. What did Mel say to you the other day? Ah, nothing. I think he was just trying to size me up. Okay. You know, if Allie ever asks you to go to a club or a bar... or get her fucking mail... you say no, okay? Yeah. I got it. I honestly didn't mean anything by it. I don't give a fuck if you meant anything by it. Just make sure it doesn't happen again. Yeah. Well, if you got nothing to say, get the fuck out of my apartment. Rule #6: There's a thin line between a friend and an enemy. See what I mean about Ellis? Not your fucking friend. But still, it doesn't justify us doing this hit. Look at that guy. Middle-aged, wife, two kids. Had a nice job, but then, boom, the economy crashes, loses his job. And now he's stuck getting me refills and asking me how I'd like my steak. Why? Because he didn't have a backup plan. Can I get that out of your way? What suggests to you in any way that I'm done with my food? Does it look like I'm fucking done? Well, you pointed at me. Uh-uh. Do you still see food on my plate? Jack, come on, man. You can answer, I'll wait. - You're right. My mistake. - Yeah, your mistake. It isn't just a steak, this is an experience. An experience you just fucking ruined. Get your fucking shit together, man. You don't need to talk to someone like that. I'm sorry, okay. Just listen. It's all a lesson. I'm trying to tell you what's going to happen to you if we don't do this. Forget about the waiter. I'll give him a nice big tip. What's important is getting the pictures off of Ellis' phone. I guess it couldn't hurt to have those photos. Okay. So you're in? I'm only telling you this shit because we're family. All right, listen, this is what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to do the same thing I did for me when I got my first big paycheck. - And what's that? - You'll see. This suit was crafted in Florence, Italy. - One of our best. - Mm. How's it feel? - I mean, it fits. - We'll take it. Rule #7... The best things in life are expensive. Remember that. Your total is $6,348.52. You made coffee? No. I've been thinking. I don't want to do this anymore. It's not rewarding, it's unsustainable. Where is this coming from? We don't have a plan for us either, Ellis. I feel like I'm wasting any potential that I might have had. You don't think I have a plan. I've been saving up. And not a small amount, either. This is not the end result. Every time we do a hit, I see everything I love about you. Stick with me, okay? We're not that far from the end. Allie, you're late. Hey, guess what I found? "It appears to be the work of the same band of youths, leaving a message in their wake of discontent. Could this possibly be the built up anger from the Millennial generation?" Can anyone tell me why writing this load of crap on a kitchen wall is a total waste of time? You accomplish nothing by destroying these places. The only thing you're doing is establishing a pattern, a calling card. A calling card that's gonna help the police hone you down to: "The suspects are believed to be in the age range of 18 to 29." Mel, we get it. You get it? Good. Good. So, now how many of you still feel the need to make these brave statements? Well, are you guys going to answer him? Come on, this is what you sold me on. Yes, Mel, we have to make our point. Well, let me tell you what your points are going to get you. While you're out making these statements, the police... Mel, you just told me how you wanted me to get these guys on track, right? If you want us to stay in line, you got to give us our freedom. It's what makes it fun. Well, then there's good news and bad news. You can keep doing it. You can keep having your fun. But the bad news is your little trail of destruction is leading back to my guy who's giving us this info, so he's decided he will no longer supply us with the addresses. That's on you, from now on. Fuck. Any of you guys have an idea on an address? Just stay in your fucking lane. I got a guy who caters to high-end events... business events, charity and shit. He can get us in. Okay, so what do we do when we get there? Act like them. With a drink in hand, but don't get fucked up. Try and find the guy in the room that everyone's talking to. Then you get your addresses. Thinking about moving somewhere out of the city. Somewhere peaceful. Where did you say you lived again? It was funny how many people acted like they knew who we were. And we consistently got asked the same question every time. - What department you in? - Accounting. - Accounting. - Part of accounting. - I work in accounting. - Accounting. Accounting, huh? You boys keeping us in line? Yeah, that's what we do. Yeah, I used to be afraid of numbers. I dabble in a bit of charity work. I'm a philanthropist. If you'll excuse me, I need to step out for a moment. Thinking about moving out of the city, somewhere more quiet. - Any suggestions? - Well, I live in South Barrington, off Bosworth. Biggest house on the block. New sound system, custom-made drapery from Spain. One of the most beautiful pools I've ever seen. Fuck you! Ah fuck. - Oh, shit. - Guys, we have a serious problem outside. Fuck. Greetings! How you doing? Ah, so, what's going on? Ah, the mister is moving out. - The mister? - Yeah. - Got a name? - Oh. Mr. Stan Lieberman. Ah. - Is he home? - No. I'm thinking he's afraid of being here right now. We were warned to clear out, too, in case the wife comes home. Oh. They seemed like such a nice couple. - She was too nice, from what I heard. - What does that mean? You ever see any guys come around here during the day? Wow. Uh... that doesn't sound like Linda. You can call Mr. Lieberman if you want confirmation. Not about the fact that she was screwing everything in sight, because you'll have me in the shit for that. But about the move. - Poor Stan. - Yeah. Yeah. You think you know somebody. Wow! Yeah. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. Guys, we got to leave now. Despite some close calls, our plan was working great. Mel was still paying us, and we were getting to do everything our own way. As far as I was concerned, we could do this forever. I had hoped Jack would see this for himself and forget about his whole backup plan, but if anything, it just encouraged him more. Not bad, huh, Mel? I mean, this shit's just as good as anything you would ask for, right? The insurance guy, he was just getting in the way, being too complicated. But, this? This is airtight. What do you want, a weekend at the spa? No, no. We were just thinking that, I mean, we're basically doing two jobs for you now. We cut out the middleman. Yeah, we did. So we should make more money, right? You think you deserve more money? I mean, yeah. Why, because you get the addresses now? Oh, was that your idea to get the addresses yourself? - It was Ellis. - Ellis. Right, you're not much of an idea guy, are you? I drive and load the truck. Grunt work, basically. Except when somebody speaks to you, then you're full of brilliant ideas. Like your absolute classic to talk to the fucking neighborhood watchman. I was trying to get rid of the guy! Yeah? What if that guy could identify you, - pick you out of a lineup? - I'm so careful, Mel, - I'd never get caught in a lineup. - Maybe, maybe not. How do I know where the fuck you guys will end up? You're unpredictable. So I'm supposed to pay you more money to keep being unpredictable? That doesn't make good business sense! Does it? Now shut up and get back to fucking work. An alert neighborhood watchman managed a good look at one of the men. - Oh, great! - Police released a sketch and ask if anybody recognizes him to contact the authorities immediately. Look at that, I'm so fucked! - Think anybody's gonna recognize you from that? - What are you trying to say? Come on, you wish you looked like that! Aw, come on, handsome! Fuck! Oh shit, come on! Shit. I'm going to go check on George Clooney, make sure he's not crying. Man, he always gets so sensitive. Okay, you're right, the sketch is funny. But today was a close call. We really gotta be more careful. You don't think Ellis is being careful? - I didn't say that. - You literally just did. You don't think I got things under control? Actually, no, you were freaking out when Chandler was talking to that guy. - Can we not do this here? - Yeah, can we not? It's a little intense. - Fuck both of you. - Oh, come on, don't be a drama queen! You're no fucking help. Pass me the phone. - Look, Jack, he's... - Come on, this is the only chance we get. Pass it to me now, let's go. Okay. - Jack, you got to hurry. - Shh. Sure, that sketch didn't look anything like him, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be more careful. - Jack, you got to hurry. - Okay, wait, wait, wait. Jesus Christ, how many pictures are there? Okay. That's not the point. Point is when you say shit like that, it undermines me. What the fuck does that mean? Okay, we're not boss-employee in this, Ellis. - We're a team. Aren't we? - Are we? Because if I remember correct, you told me you wanted out. - Jack. - Just wait, it's going. Almost there. So we couldn't even be together if I wasn't part of this? Huh? Answer. It's not that fucking hard. I'm done. Jack, pull it. Pull it, Jack. Wait, wait, almost there, almost there. - Wait, no, no, no. - Okay, we got, got it, got it. Just shuffle, man. Jeez, I thought there was going to be bloodshed for sure. - Everything all right? - Yeah. Just when you thought things couldn't get more exciting. - Jack, that was so close. - Mm-hmm. All right. Some guy called Daniel Wardlaw. Jesus, these photos are out of a magazine. Most home systems aren't rated by a UL system. This is a TL-60. It can withstand attacks by common tools for over an hour. Define common tools. Explosives, torches. I mean, Jack, this thing has a military-grade vault door. We might as well take the whole thing. - It's a room. - Yeah. No wonder they're showing it in a magazine. Jack, if we're going to do this, we need Stewart. Mmm, fuck. He's put a lot of work into this. It'd take time to get in that safe. Digital lock will be impossible to break. We'll have to burn our way. - Not easy to get, or cheap. - Can you do it? Yeah, I could figure it out. Great, let's split it three ways, even. Four. I'm not doing it without Chandler. Two of you guys and one of me? I don't know what else you're planning. It's not about you. It's about Ellis. This is back pay for all the times he screwed us over. Fine, if this is just about Ellis, then you should have no problem bringing Chandler on. Plus I don't want that crazy PTSD bastard on Ellis's side. You know Ellis is going to be pissed the fuck off if he finds out. Yeah, and that's why we're counting on him not finding out. - Makes you feel better, you want him, done. - Okay. There has to be a connection between the value of the house and no schedule. This guy is so rich, he never has to leave. I saw online the guy's a big donor at a conference in New York in a couple weeks. Great, we'll do it then. Can you get us a new car? No reason we drive the moving truck in here. - I can get a van. - All right, perfect. Let's do it then. But find out exactly when this conference is. I don't want to show up and find the housekeeper. No, you guys, this is supposed to be a backup plan. Lance, dude, you are new here, okay? Been dealing with his bullshit way longer than you have. - Been trying to tell him. - I vote we do Wardlaw when he's in New York. - I second that. - All right, fine. - But we should keep doing what we've been doing. - Lance is right. For now. She's not answering. We should have Lance try. She's not coming. Does she know where we're going? - Yeah, so what? - She's pissed at you. Nobody's seen her in days, she could have flipped. I'm not doing this shit till you figure it out. Doesn't feel right. Fine, I'll call her. Fucking phone. Something wrong with your phone? - Give me your fucking phone. - You know what? Fuck this, I'm out. - I'm out, I'm not doing this bullshit. - Sorry, dude. This is a fucking joke, right? You're joking. - Lance! - If we're not in this together, it's nothing, Ellis. Telling you, we gotta hit this place - whether this old fuck is there or not. - Fuck it, I'm in. - I'm ready, let's do this! - We shouldn't just make a decision - out of the spur of the moment! - We gotta hit it now. You heard Ellis! You're putting us in this position so we have to do this. Come on, you guys, we know that Allie's not going to the cops. - I don't know, man, she's a wild card. - I agree. Look, if we do this when Wardlaw is in town, this whole thing goes from a robbery to a kidnapping. And we're not here to hurt anybody, right? Let me call Allie. I'm sorry... just... for not coming around as much. I feel like, like I disappointed you guys somehow. No, sweetie, not at all. I'm sorry, I have to take this. Can I be excused? Of course. Sorry. I can't talk right now. Okay. Just wanted to call and check up on you. They told you to call? Can we talk about this in person? So this is where you grew up. Yep. This reminds me of my aunt's house. Jack's mom. Why did you come out here, Lance? Um, just wanted to check on you. You know, we were waiting for you, earlier. I'm sure you guys did fine without me. We didn't go. Why not? I think you guys have been doing this for so long that they didn't really feel comfortable... They thought I went to the cops. Yeah. I didn't, but... I just needed to get away. But I don't belong here anymore, either. What did you want to do, before all this? Art. - Art? - Yeah. But... guess that was pretty pointless. No, you're not giving yourself enough credit. You knew every expensive piece in every house, made Mel a shit-ton of money. - You did! - That's true. But the original plan was to sell the art and not steal it. Right. What about you? I always wanted to help people. Okay. Plan A was to be a humanitarian, and Plan B was to rob houses. You're such an asshole. But, yes. You're coming back, right? Yeah. We need you. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Are you going out? I've got to go see Mel. Why? Why do you think? You can come with me if you want. Or not. Allie! Glad you could make it. Anybody know what the fuck we're doing here? Got to explain what happened today. - All of us? - Not you. You don't explain shit, keep your fucking mouth shut. Hey, right on time. I think you finally earned the opportunity to meet one of my associates, Teddy. What do you think of these jokers, Teddy? - Younger than the last crew. - Uh-huh. There's no need to introduce yourselves, he already knows all your names. Mel, what happened today won't happen again. That's nice. Yeah. You're such a nice group of kids, tight-knit. Friendship, that's everything, right? Like me and Teddy over here. But that's not what we're here to talk about. We're here to discuss the possibility that you may not have taken the day off. Why would we lie to you? So you could unload what you stole on someone else. We don't have anybody else like that. I mean, it wasn't that long ago you couldn't get the addresses yourselves. And you've made very clear, in the interim, that you think you deserve more than I pay you. - Don't we? - See? There you go. But you made the choice to make it harder for yourselves. And for me too because, since I don't get the addresses anymore, I can't even follow up on this house you may or may not have hit this afternoon. Can we just all take a moment just to get on the same page here? Nah. I don't think we're on the same page about anything. You see, some of you feel you deserve more for the same work. And others think they're entitled, and some of you think leaving your statement makes you as special as your mommy made you, each and every one a little snowflake. But the only thing you have in common is being lazy. We didn't do the hit because we weren't feeling it. It was out of caution for our sake and for your sake. Well, why did you have a bad feeling about it? I had a feeling. Okay? And you should be thanking us. Holy shit. Mel, today was just a minor setback. We're not selling to anybody else. I think you're going to have to. Because this, tonight? Is the end of this agreement. But those friendships, they just got more important than ever. Because if someone considers going off the tracks and ends up talking, my friend Teddy here, he doesn't just know your names. He knows where you live. He knows where your mom lives, and what her maiden name was before she moved there. He knows what you drive, and where you party. So if one of you even so much as whispers my name, that man's face will be the last thing all of you see. So, treasure your friendships. You're a fucking joke. Allie, come on. You are pushing 50 and peddling stolen shit. I think you might be the problem, Mel. You think we'd be doing any of this if it wasn't for someone like you? You can blame me as much as you want, but don't lie to yourself. If you guys weren't doing this, it'd be something else just as bad. I don't give a fuck what you think. I just wanted to remind you that you are just as pathetic as we are. Ellis blamed me for what happened that night, and I get that. But I hit the point where I stopped caring if I was acting reckless. Ellis was pitching the guys on some bullshit one-last-heist. There's a guy called Daniel Wardlaw. He has a vault underneath his house, enough cash to... I just tuned them out. I didn't give a fuck about any of this anymore. He leaves home for three or four days next week... we can hit it then. My guy is here. We got to do this now, before Ellis does. - I'm not doing it if someone's home. - He's 100 fucking years old. He's probably not even going to hear us. We've got to do this. Otherwise we're stuck with him. The average human body can handle anywhere up to 600 milligrams of Molly. I took more than twice that amount that night, and a full three grams of blow. - Something happened to Allie. Ellis! - Fuck off, ruining my high. - Ellis, listen to me, man! We gotta go! - She's your fucking problem. Rule #8: The most dangerous people are those with nothing to lose. How is she? Take a left. Gotta get to the hospital. We're not going to the fucking hospital. We've got drugs in the car, we're fucked up. - We're going to get fucking busted. - Jack, please! Keep her up, she'll choke on her throw-up. Calm the fuck down, man! - We're going to take her home. - Take her home? She's OD'ing, what are you talking about? Jack, please. Okay, fine, we'll take her to the fucking hospital. Now what? - I'm not taking her in. - Fuck that. - I'm not fucking going in there. - I'll take her. - Stay in the car. - If we go in, we're getting arrested. - Someone needs to take her. - Someone's gonna see us, Stewart. Hurry. - What the fuck do you want me to do? - Just get her out. - Someone needs to stay. - We do not have a choice. She cannot be in this car. - Security is coming. Hurry the fuck up! - Fuck it! - Fucking kidding me? - Lance, stay in the car! The fuck is wrong with you guys? Oh, fuck. Hey! I need a stretcher, I need a stretcher right now! Alicia, I need some assistance over here. Coming, I'm coming. Looks like an OD. Let's get her on the stretcher. Open her airways... We've still got a pulse. Let's get her inside. I'm ready to be done with all of this. You should be. You don't owe them anything. What's your plan? I'll go home. Pack. I'll figure it out. I might have something. And if it works, it might be a way out of all of this. I really hope so. Yo, you give Chandler that gun? - No, why? - Because he's actually shot one before. - I think I can shoot a gun. - Who said anything about shooting? - I thought we were just using it to scare him? - Yeah, exactly. - See, it doesn't even matter. - Jesus Christ. I can't believe you brought a fucking gun. What do you think, Lance? Huh? I don't give a shit. That's what I think. If you're still upset about Allie, you need to get the fuck over it, - because we got work to do. - You know what? Fuck you, Stewart. I can't just get over the fact we left one of our best friends to die on a fucking sidewalk. Hey, none of us wanted to do that, okay? Yeah, none of us wanted to do it, but you fucking did it, right? You threw her right on the street! Because I didn't want to go to jail! No one wants to go to jail, dumb fuck! I spent the whole night in the hospital, and guess where I am? - Sitting right in front of you, right? - Stop! Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Fucking idiot. You know what's the best part about this? What? That I never have to see you fuckers again. You said it. What? Alarm's off. Fuck this guy. You deal with the cameras. Let's find him. Copy. Don't move. Don't you fucking move. - Jack! - Get up. - Anybody else in the house? - No, no, please, take what you want. - What's the code for the safe? - What safe? - Do not fuck with me! Think I give a fuck about your life? - 9-12-23. - Did you catch that, Stewart? - I got it. - Get down! - Jack! Give me your fucking hands. There we go. - Jack. - Get the fuck off me! Roll over. Don't make a fucking noise. Come on. Open sesame, motherfucker. Open it. Holy shit. Holy shit's right. Okay, come on, let's fill it up. - Shit, it's just spilling everywhere! - So much fucking money. I've never seen this much money in my whole life. Fuck Ellis. Fuck all those assholes. We're rich. I'm going to buy a boat, buy a house. Get my mom something nice. Take my brother out to dinner. Yo, yo-yo-yo. Hold this, hold this open. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Rule #9: Emotions are more powerful than rational thought. Yo, open the fucking door! No! - What happened? - They're locked in. - What? - We got to go, now! Go, go, go, go, go. What the fuck was that? - The door shut. - The door shut? The door shut by itself? Lance, did you fucking close the door? - Maybe I did. - Are you fucking kidding me with that shit, Lance? - Do you not understand they're going to rat now? - We'll just fucking lay low. You're just pissed, that's why you closed them in there. You pissed at me? Because I was in that car when we threw her out. Yeah, well, maybe you were lucky you weren't in that vault too. - Allie, listen to me. - Allie... Allie, really? My fucking God. No, I don't have any time to explain. Please, you got to pack your bag right now. I got to get you out of the city, Allie, please. Goddamn it, Lance, slow the fuck down. You gotta be fucking kidding me with this shit, Lance. Come on, think for a second. - Stay and watch the fucking van. - Stay in the fucking van? You're gonna fuck this up for her? You don't think she's going to tell Ellis what we did? What you did? The cops are on their way, so this is not the time for this. You're not going to listen to me now? After all of this... I can take you out. Don't fucking touch me, Jack. Lance, this is embarrassing. What do you think is going to happen? Give me the keys. - What the fuck, Lance? - Allie, let's go. - You asked me to get you out of this shit. - But how? - Tell her why we're here. - Tell me what? - Jack, shut up! - Tell her. We have more cash in the van than we've ever made, or ever will make. Stewart and Chandler got caught. You and Ellis will be next too if you don't come. - What did you do? - We hit the Wardlaw house. - That's your plan to get us out? - It wasn't my plan but that's what happened. Let's go. Did I hear that correct? You come to my house and you pull a fucking gun on me? You know, there's two kinds of dogs. There's the ones that bark, fucking yappy little fuckers. Yap-yap-yap-yap. And then there's the ones that bite. I know what kind of dog you are. Okay, Lance, let's get out of here, come on. Allie. Are you coming with me or not? She ain't going anywhere. Allie, please. Fuck both of you. Lance, let's go, come on. Come on. I mean, that just went great for you, huh? Fuck, okay. It all started with this guy Mel Donnelly. He's basically like our boss. We got our addresses from Mel. - I think he got 'em from... - Fuck. ...some insurance guy from State By State Insurance, some bullshit like that. I think they were that guy's clients. Once we got the addresses, we'd stake out a house for like a week. I know that Jack was as guilty as Stewart and Chandler. But in the end, he was all I had. Reports now indicate that the Wardlaw robbery was just one of a string of robberies in the Chicago suburbs. At least 70 robberies from the past two years are believed to be part of the string. Four suspects have been apprehended in connection to the robberies. Three more are currently at large. Fuck, it's hot in here. Dude, I'm going to get some ice. Fuck. - You okay? - No, I'm not okay, Jack. None of this is fucking okay. Let's just get some rest. We'll get out of here tomorrow. We can't go anywhere with our faces all over the news. Lance, come on. Sit down. I promise, first thing in the morning, we're out of here. But we got each other, and right now, that's all I care about because I would not want to be stuck in this situation with anyone else. I know you may not feel the same way. And that's okay. You've been through a lot today and you're upset, and I get it. We've all done shitty things here. I wouldn't have shut that vault door if you were in it, Jack. I know. Maybe I would have deserved it if you did. Wow. But I forgive you. Just like you forgive me because we're family, right? First thing in the morning... let's ditch the van. We'll get the money and we'll head west. First thing in the morning. But right now, seriously, we need to get some sleep. - Jack, I can't sleep. - Oh, yes, I think you can. You'll be out as soon as your head hits the pillow, I promise. It's been a long, long day. Go on. Deep breaths. And when the heat's off, we'll go wherever we want to go. Do whatever we want to do. Be whoever we want to be. We'll go anywhere. Blend in. We'll leave all this behind. It'll be nothing but a memory. Like a dream you can only remember a few details of. We'll finally be free... and live the life we've always wanted. I had nowhere to go. No money, no chances of getting away. I thought if I turned myself in, they'd have a better chance of catching Jack. Just wasn't fast enough. So, do you think that was Jack's plan all along, to bring you in just to leave you behind? It's not really about the art. You did it already, might as well enjoy it. Just you and me on this. You should take Lance. She's a wild card. Because we're family, right? I have no idea. - I'm glad I told them everything. - You get a reduced sentence? Yeah. But I shouldn't be in here, anyway. I'm a political prisoner. Excuse me? Everything I did, I did in rebellion against this system. - I was terrified at the time. - I didn't see what was going on in front of me. It really was all about the joy of destruction. - I was in a weak psychological state. - He used me. - I'm happy we were caught. - Hey lady, you should write that down. - It's not gonna get better than that. - Tell me about Ellis. You testified you don't know where he is. Do you still feel the need to protect him? Just from me. Would you do it again? Fuck no! - No. - No. - What was your sentence? - Seven years. - Thirteen years. - Nine years. - 55 counts of breaking and entering. - 56 counts... - 24 counts... - One count armed robbery. - Robbery... - Vandalism. - Vandalism. - One kidnapping, but I appealed. You gave me only nine rules. Is there a tenth commandment? Yeah. The tenth commandment is that the rest of those rules are a bunch of bullshit. What was your sentence? Twelve years. Fifteen counts of robbery and vandalism. I'll be out in eight, I think. Lance, you mentioned a generation gap when we first started. I feel obligated to tell you that I have a pretty fair understanding of your age group. Statistics indicate that your generation, by and large, is much more than an echo of anything. Crime among your age group is down 70%. Tobacco and alcohol, lower than ever. Much more diverse, so much more racially tolerant. You're going to put people to sleep with that book. Okay, Lance. I have one last question. Would you do it again? In a heartbeat.
