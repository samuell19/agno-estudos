[gloves rasping] [light music] [rattling] [calm music] [birds chirping] [Sahithi] Water, air, the Earth. We all share them. With the environment, you see the same issues repeated across the world. It's inevitably our job as the next generation to tackle this. The people who are approaching this through the eye of science are the people who can fix it, and who are going to fix it. [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [birds chirping] [in Indonesian] [speaking Indonesian] [laughs] [speaking Indonesian] [women speaking Indonesian] [children chattering] [Nuha speaking Indonesian] [both singing in Indonesian] [continues singing in Indonesian] [all laughing] [girl cheers] [in Indonesian] [woman speaking Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [Nuha and woman speaking Indonesian] [woman speaking Indonesian] [Nuha and woman speaking Indonesian] [children chattering] [speaking Indonesian] [woman speaking Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [woman speaking Indonesian] [people chattering] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [splashing] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [Nuha in Indonesian] [crowd cheering] [in English] [host] Welcome to ISEF. International Science and Engineering Fair. Can I get a show of hands? How many of you are here competing for the very first time? -[crowd cheering] -[host] Wow. [woman #1] When the students come, they've already gone through a series of competitions to get to the level of ISEF. And students who really want to advance know they have to do original research. This is the science fair of science fairs. [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [cheers] [women giggling] [birds chirping] [bird tweets] [bird chirps] [whispering in English] It's a juvenile. -Juvenile? -Juvenile. Right there. This tree. Left tree. Come here. Yeah, I see the black jays are coming. They're coming, Jared. Jared, Jared, Jared. Right there, right there. [lens rasping] -Oye. -[camera shutter clicking] [Jared] Oh, it's a 'I'iwi. Their signature pose is upside down and facing forward. [Jared] I'm actually a third generation. Born and raised in Hilo, Hawaii. I was always taught by my parents, my grandparents, to always respect the 'Aina. The land that we live off of. I just find great enjoyment being with nature. [calm music] [Jared] I first started coming to Huilua Pond when I was about three years old. My grandma, she would bring me here to feed the ducks bread. Growing up, I always heard, you know, the terms arsenic, contamination, and, you know, dangerous. But I was never really told how it got in the soil. Eventually, I learned about the production plant in Huilua Pond. Over a 28-year period, they've released an estimated 558 tons of arsenic into the pond. [Jared] And then, two tsunamis struck Hilo. Arsenic spread out into the town through the force of the tsunami waves. So this location where we are right now... [grunts] ...is actually the border of the inundation zone from the 1960's tsunami. A lot of the debris that was contained in any of the water was most likely left here and never picked up again. [Jared] That's why I'm digging up these samples. I can create sort of a zoning hotspot map to know exactly where these arsenic concentrations are. [Jared] It becomes a really big hazard, if we have ten times the safe limit of arsenic just lying around the soil here. Long-term effects of arsenic can include anything from decreased eyesight, loss of hearing, bladder cancer. [woman #2] Look at this big duck. Go! [Jared] Even the wildlife is contaminated. [geese quacking] [Jared] Four generations of my family has been involved with the pond. That's what really drew me into my science fair project. [geese cackling] [wind howling] [waves crashing] [grandma] It was about quarter to seven in the morning. I was the only one up. I never saw the tide this low, where there's no water. [grandma] Can you believe, right in the back of our yard? Gone. [Jared] Like the whole bay was just like a drain. Yeah. Your great grandma, she got up and looked out the window, and then she yelled. "Tsunami!" [grandma] The wave was coming. And what did the waves look like? It was rolling in, like this. It was... I can never forget the picture of it. It must have been about... 40 or 50 feet high. [grandma] We ran. And then, the wave came. Our house was flat. There was nothing left of our house. In the meantime, great grandpa was traveling from Pa'auilo to Hilo. So, he figured that we were all gone. Then when he drove in with his car, we all went out. You know, I never saw great grandpa cry the way he did. We were all just crying and holding each other like, "Wow. We found life." [grandma] Yeah. [engines revving] [horns honking] [Sahithi's dad] When I was growing up, I remember the lake. -[man #1] Yeah. -[Sahithi's dad] Um, it's by... Just five minutes walk from our house. And I ate in front of the temple in the village. And it was so nice and clear. And there used to be lotuses in the lake. And we would go and jump in the canal and swim. People sometimes used to wash their clothes. -[Sahithi] Mm. -They used to wash the buffalos. [all laugh] If only that was our problem now. Now, we see in all the cities, look. Only concrete buildings, no place left for trees. [Sahithi's dad] Everything was connected, right? This combination of water and sun is something so sacred to us. [Sahithi's dad] That every aspect of nature, we pray to the hills, we pray to the water, we pray to the trees. Because these are all giving us everything we need. This is the kind of tradition we come from, right? -[bell jingling] -[distant traffic noise] [horns honking] [Sahithi] Bangalore was once known as the City of One Thousand Lakes. But now it's known as the Silicon Valley of India. And now, there's only around 93 lakes. [Sahithi] The sad thing is, as more people started moving here, sewage goes into the lakes, mainly because it has nowhere else to go. The lack of infrastructure is definitely a problem. Where is the lake? [Sahithi sucks teeth, groans] [Sahithi] Oh, my god. You can't even tell there's a lake. It's so overgrown with weeds. Um, which is a really bad sign, because when you have this many weed, it's a sign of something called eutrophication. [Sahithi] Which is so much nutrient sewage contamination, that all these plants start growing, and they block the light to the lower layers of the lake. Basically, just kills everything that lives in the water, and you have a dead lake. [ominous music] [Sahithi] The fire and foam are what really got people interested in the lakes, and got a lot of people to start working on them. [Sahithi] The sewage that causes this foam mainly comes from apartments. So you can see there's a lot of buildings around here, and they release raw sewage into the lake. A lot of the detergents and stuff that people use contain really high levels of phosphates. And all that chemical waste does go untreated. [ominous music] [Sahithi] They say Bangalore will be a dead city in another 25 years, because of water alone. [foreboding music] [bus engine revving] [in Spanish] Uh-huh. [chuckles] [in English] How are you? [in Spanish] [in English] Eh, we, we are fine. [all laugh] [Jose in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [somber music] [Jesus in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter continues] [in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [mumbles] [Jose in Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [Fernando in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [whirring] [Fernando in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [upbeat music playing on TV] -[speaking Spanish] -[laughs] [speaking Spanish] [laughs] [man speaking Spanish over the phone] [man on phone in English] Do you know what I mean? [speaking slowly] Do you know what I mean? [man speaking Spanish on phone] [man on phone in English] How do you pronounce this? [speaking slowly] How do you pronounce this? [Jesus in Spanish] [toddler coos] [both chuckle] [Jesus in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [indistinct chatter] [Fernando in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [toddler babbling] [indistinct chatter] Hey, man. -That's dope. -[Jared] Thank you. -[man #2] When are you leaving? -Fourteenth. -So what is your project of? -You know what arsenic is? -Yeah. -So, there's like this factory that produced, like, dry board. But they actually put like arsenic into the pond, that they've released it over time. Oh, that's a mess. Yeah. So then, what happened is this tsunami came, and then, it just... It dumped everything from the pond onto the soil. Whoa. That's critical. Better stop fishing over there. No. I mean, you can eat the fish, but it's, like, it'll just build up in you over time. You can't get rid of it. -Oh. -It's like... you know, it kinda sucks. -Yeah. -In that sense. [both] Yeah. [sighs] My mom's here, so, shoots, bro. -See you later. -See you later. [Jared's mom] See, that's the third red light you've gone through. I mean, you totally -did not stop. -[Jared] I did so not. I'm driving under the speed limit. I just... I focus on the road, I didn't see the traffic light. And maybe I should just drive when I'm not so stressed. Well, you know, if I sit there, then I won't drive when I'm stressed. I'll never drive. -Yeah, I'm just saying-- -I'm always under stress. [Jared] Yeah. But it was just something -I didn't-- -You can't control things. -I didn't see it. -But when you get behind the wheel, you need to focus. [Dr. Steve] Maybe what we should do is just organize these guys a little bit. So this manure is one set right here. [Jared] Let's start up like we're setting up, um, like the inundation zone. [Dr. Steve] I like it. [glass clanking] -Yeah, that looks good. -I hope it works. [Dr. Steve] Let's take a look and see what it is we ended up with. What we see is that your hypothesis is at least supported by the data here, where you have a significantly higher concentration... Mm-hm. of arsenic outside, or at the border of the inundation zone. [Dr. Steve] And when you're inside, you have a lower value. So we see a fairly large change here between outside and inside from these samples. [Dr. Steve] Absolutely. [Jared] So, the thing I wanna show first at the science fair, I zoom in to this pond, you know, like area one, area two, area three. But then, I also have the 1960 tsunami inundation, so maybe I should add the 46. -I would add the 46. -Okay, this is a good note. But I see this as you're kind of documenting those things. You know, it's always nice to point out what you... kind of don't know and maybe... somebody will be smart enough to figure out how to get through that, right? [Dr. Steve] Maybe it's you. Um... So the title like, "Redistribution of Arsenic Contaminants." Yeah, I think that's a good... -So, like, I should definitely -That's probably a good word. -mention, "Redistribution." -Yeah. Yeah, I... I think that's a good word. I think that's a good... -That's a good word. -Is that one word? It is. -It's a weird word. -[laughs] [boat engine revving] [light music] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] Okay. [Nuha in Indonesian] [Intan in Indonesian] [engine humming] [in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] -Mm. -Mm. [in Indonesian] -[engine revving] -[indistinct chatter] [whirring] [Intan in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [man speaking Indonesian] -Ah. -Ah. [in Indonesian] -[man speaking Indonesian] -[both] Oh. [Intan in Indonesian] [speaking Indonesian] -[in Indonesian] -Oh. [in Indonesian] [man in Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [man in Indonesian] Ah. [waves lapping] [light music] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] -[storekeeper in Indonesian] -Yeah, yeah, yeah. [continues in Indonesian] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] -[in Indonesian] -[storekeeper] Okay. Yeah. [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [Dr. Rudi in Indonesian] [glass clanks] [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [Dr. Rudi] Okay. [Nuha in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [water trickling] [bell tolling] [Sahithi] We have been continuing doing water testing every week. We actually have some samples waiting in the lab as soon as we're done with this. But one significant thing that happened was, as a lot of you know, Bellandur Lake caught fire again. Oh, it actually caught fire twice, over February and March. And a bunch of us, three of us, were a part of the protest that happened there. And we actually had several news channels approach us and ask us for our data. Because we had the most recent Bellandur Lake data in the entire city. -[man #3] Whoa. -[applauding] [Sahithi] I started more on the activism side. But I found it really hard to get the kind of data I needed regarding what pollution exactly is happening. Which is why I got into science. -Oh, you broke the beaker. -No, it just... [Sahithi] It was cracked already. [chuckling] [girl] Yeah. Before ISEF, I've had to cram all of the research into a very little time. For me, ISEF is just the beginning. I know that it will be a great motivator to make sure I was growing my project. [Sahithi sighs, hums] [Sahithi] So I wanted to mainly achieve two things. One is make water testing easy. And two, make the results accessible to people and easy to analyze. So I built my app. It uses electronic sensors and chemical test strips. To let you test several parameters of a lake sample. Here, I have some water from Devarabeesanahalli Lake. So, I put the probe in the water. And all the values from the probe will be sent via Bluetooth to my phone. Okay, so now, there's the chemical test strips. You can see the strip has changed color. So you can use the color recognition part of my app. Once I've also done the testing with the chemical test strips, all the data will be on a single phone. And that will be sent to the cloud platform. There, I've enabled various visualizations. Even for a layman, they can see for example, visualizations that let you see how a lake has changed over time, see how two different lakes compare. Anyone in the world can view it. [doorbell rings] [Sahithi] Greetings! -How are you doing? -Hi. -No, I don't do hugs. -Oh, that's so bad. -We can do an arm grasp thing. -Oh. -[chuckles] -Hi. Hello, auntie. -Hi, how are you? -Auntie, how are you? I'm good. Mm. [car horns honking] [bells jangling] [Sahithi] Echo! Why are you doing that? [Sahithi] Good echoes. Echo. -You actually live here. -Echo. You ever throw rock in and make foam holes? No. [chuckles] -Can I? -Why would you do that? [Prashaant] Whoa. [Sahithi] Wow. [calm music] [birds chirping] Guess we have completely lost our way here. [Sahithi] The lake closest to my house. Even that one lake to be vivid would be such a huge task. But it's a place I really love. GO A BIT FORWARD AND DITCH THE GARBAGE [Sahithi's dad] It's such a relief to come back in. [Sahithi] Yeah, I know. But then, because we live here, it's like we're bubbled, you know. We don't realize... what's going on outside. I mean, it's our own sewage that goes, right? [Sahithi's dad] Right. [calm music] -[indistinct chatter] -[whistle blows] [indistinct chatter] [Jose in Spanish] -[chuckles] -[continues in Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Marcela speaking Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [Jose continues in Spanish] [in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [in Spanish] [chuckles] -[in Spanish] -[chuckles] [continues in Spanish] [Jesus sighs] [wheels rattling] [in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [Jose chuckles] [indistinct chatter] [Jose in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [woman speaking Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [in Spanish] [girl in Spanish] [Jose] Mm.

Do you see me? Why, where are you? [announcer]Welcome, finalists, - to Intel ISEF. -[crowd cheering] [announcer] The International Science and Engineering Fair. [crowd cheering] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Maya Ajmera. [Maya] Welcome, everyone. Intel ISEF Finals this year hail from 78 countries, regions, and territories. In the science fairs every year around the globe, tens of millions of students compete, and then it boils down to you, the best of the best. The education each and every one of you will receive this week is absolutely impossible to get in a classroom. -This is your time. -[applause] This is your day. [all cheering, applauding] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Manu Prakash. Over the last year or so, I've been personally depressed. Climate change, biodiversity laws, denial of science. All these challenges sound very daunting. But when I think about these problems that are sprinkled everywhere, the solutions are also sprinkled everywhere. And that solution lies in the spark of eyes of people like you. We have to do everything we can to build an army of scientists around the world. That is our only hope. [light music] -Thank you. -I'll see you around. Good luck. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Where are you from? -I am from Ireland. But I have no pennies left. -Yeah, no problem. -Oh, thank you. Wait, wait, wait. With my phone. Oh. [laughs] -[giggles] -Thank you. Who else is here from India? -We have 45 people. -45 people? Twenty-nine are competing, -and the rest are observers. -What? Uh, do you like animal manga? Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. -Yeah? -You, do you like? -Uh, I like. -[laughs] -I like -Me, too. -animal manga. -Okay. So I just went out, and I'm just trying to decide, like, who I'm gonna go to. Yeah, I got Brazil, but... [chanting in Portuguese] Where are you from in India? I'm from Bangalore. -Bangalore? -But I speak good Telugu. -My mom's from Kashmir. -Oh, wow. -Yeah. Hindu. -Would you like a tassel? [Fernando] Would you take a photo with me? [in Spanish] -Would you take a photo-- -Ah. Would you take... -Uh-huh. -[both] ...a photo with me? [Fernando] Uh-huh. Would you take a photo with me? Oh, sure, sure. Okay. -Oh, where are you from? -I'm from Korea. Korea? I'm from Hawaii. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -Good luck. -Sure. Okay. [in Spanish] Whoa. [laughs] [in Spanish] [Fernando] Ah! [indistinct chatter] [wheels rasping] [light music] [Jose] Chemistry. [Jared] I got. I got it. [in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] No, no, no. [in Spanish] [Jose] Dude. [in Spanish] [Jose] Jesus. Jesus. [Jesus reading in Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [in Spanish] Inspector? To all the figures, they are... -[Jared] In... -Um... And then they're referenced -somewhere beside it, somewhere? -Wait. Oh, Mom. Mom. Oh, shit. [Nuha] What your project is about? -It's on water monitoring. -Mm-hm. Like, you can see we have these super polluted lakes in Bangalore. [Sahithi] What about you? What's your project on? Um, my country, especially my island, has some problems in the mine industry. And the sea sand, could, uh, you know, -find the heavy metal ions. -Oh, yeah. [Nuha] What's the solution that, um, you have conducted? [Sahithi] Basically, what I've done is, you know how, like, you, this... -All this heavy metal pollution. -Yeah. Yeah. This pollution, that pollution. But the problem is, in a lot of these water bodies, we don't know what pollution is there. So, before you can try to mediate it, you need to find -what pollution's there, right? -Mm. Okay. We could combine our projects. I could detect it, and you could cure it. Yeah. [laughs] What do you think about Intel ISEF? It's so big. Oh, my god. Yeah. Really big. [both chuckle] [indistinct chatter] It's like, just go with your passion and start, uh, there. And then you can develop a project based on what you like. -An electric jet engine? -Yup. Oh, that's... awesome. How long does it take to charge? [man #5] Um, we use the wall socket. -Wall socket? -And so... Yeah. I don't know if any of your parents have a... a Ninja Blender. [kid] No, I don't think we do. [man #5] But, this is actually Ninja Blender. That is amazing. So has, like, any investors come here? [Maya humming] [humming continues] [Maya] Oh, my god. That's very cool. [Maya hums] My seat belt obligates drivers to put on a seat belt to turn on the car and to drive the car. There's no quantifiable factor right now to diagnose a patient with autism. That's why it's so groundbreaking. [Jose] This photocatalytic reaction works with a chemiluminescence. -Chemi... Ah. Yeah, yeah. -Chemiluminescence. To register the accretion of the concentration of each gas. What is unique about this titanium dioxide? Is it the size of the particles? Yeah. The sol-gel method gives us this characteristic. -Yeah. -In the titanium dioxide. How do you get this to a point of how do you build your community? How do you... -Is this locally? -I've been working -with some schools. -Yeah. I've started with students just because their environmental education... -I guess, your own school? -Yeah. My own school and a couple nearby. Have you spoken to some people in the government? Or... Not the government. I've spoken to some non-profits. Planning to get to the government, eventually. [both] Yeah. Yeah. I think one trick that's... it's counterintuitive is the more you pass the ownership of this to other bodies, the more sustainable this will be. -[Sahithi] Yeah. -'Cause if it's just you, -you will find it's hard. -Yeah. [Manu] Yeah, yeah. Do you speak Spanish? -Yeah. -They do. They speak Spanish. -I don't, but they do. -Nice. Okay. How many of you speak Spanish? [in Spanish] [in Spanish] Okay. [in Spanish] [in Spanish] [Jesus in Spanish] [in Spanish] Every one of these locations that I tested around Huilua Pond did not meet the EPA safe level standard of arsenic contamination which was 20 parts per million. Do you think that you can actually prove that correlation is causation? Like, could there have been, like, other factors possible that would have lead to this distribution that you saw here. Perhaps, it isn't that the inundation is causing these certain arsenic levels, right? Is there, potentially, like, a barrier where you can see, um, the arsenic levels and then where they go down to and then when they're going to start to decrease? Um, obviously, I would like to say future testing would probably be the better, um, alternative for me to answer those questions. [Jared] Tell me if this makes sense, okay? So, I talk about the acid discontinuation, uh, last year's project... Wait, wait, wait. Okay, let me talk. Last year's project, this is the results I found. I came up with one model, this. And now, this year, I wanna test it with this pond. But that's the thing, I wanted to switch this. Before, I was putting what the pond was, before the history, but it would have been better to put the history before the pond use. I should talk about the history of the... Talk about the history of the pond first. Be like, you know, 558 tons over time... -Wait, wait, wait. -[indistinct mumble] [Jared] Don't rush me. I'm tired of being rushed today. Kids, I think, in developing countries, they get more connected to these environmental issues. Like, I don't know, I talked to a girl from Ukraine about trash burning in her country. And we like bonded over that. We were like, "Oh, you guys burn trash?" "People burn trash in our country, too." Then we're like, "We need to solve this together." But, um, maybe not so much in the US. But, I mean, your lake, like it's right next to your school. -Yeah. -But here... It would be several miles away. -Yeah, like-- -So, even if you are concerned, you may not even know it exists. And that's what I'm saying, in order to be concerned, you need to know it exists -in the first place. And that's, -Yeah. I think, a main issue in the US. Like, we don't know whether it exists or not. [buzzing] -Okay. -Yes. -That, that's, those vibrations. -Uh-huh. It'll put the fire away. -Ooh. -So, yes. [stutters] I love it. -You love it? -Yeah. -Your voice's still gone from... -[stutters] -[chuckles] -...the party. No, but, usually, it's this. [Jose] Uh, is... Mm. Grave? Grave. Hard. -[growling] -Uh. -Gruff? -Gruff. -Gruff. Yeah. -Gruff. -How do you say screaming in... -In... Gritar. -Garita? - Gritar. Garita? Gri-tar. [trilling] Garitar. [trilling] [Jose] With "ar," but hard. -Ar? -[trilling] -[trilling] - Gritar. [Jose chuckles] Gritar. - Gritar, yeah. -[chuckles] -Got it. -[laughing] [announcer] May I have your attention, please? Finalists, you must be at your project, ready to be judged, by 8 a.m., tomorrow morning. Okay. You guys, ask me questions, okay? Like, you know what kind of questions they ask. -[woman #4] Yeah, yeah. -Well, ask. They always ask about the data, it's cool. They stop you with questions, right? [woman #4] Yeah. You guys should simulate exactly what they do. [woman #4] It depends, really. I mean... Like, you just have to be prepared for it. -Try and interrupt talking. -[woman #4] Yeah, yeah. 'Cause I haven't had practice with interrupting. -[woman #4] Yeah, okay. -Okay, I'll start. [woman #4] Here you go... [man speaking in Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [continues in Indonesian] [all cheer] [dramatic music] [woman speaking in Spanish] [in Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [in Spanish] Okay.

[in Spanish] [all cheer] [in Spanish] [chanting] [all chanting] [chanting] [all chanting] [suspenseful music] [announcer] Ready for judges, begin interview period one. Ready for judges, begin interview period one. -Hi. -[Steve] Hi, I'm Steve. Nice to meet you, Steve. Good morning. [Steve] Good morning. [Steve] Tell me about your project. -Hi, I'm Terry. -[Jose] Yeah. -Jose. -I'm Jesus. -Jesus, Jose. -Yeah, Jose. -Interpreter, Sydney. -Nice to meet you. -[Terry] Interpreter, got that. -Yeah. -I'm. Alma. -I'm Sahithi. Nice to meet you. Same here. So, where are you from? I am from Indonesia. -Okay. Okay. -Uh-huh. Uh, especially, Bangka Belitung province. Bangka is one of the largest in mining industry. And we have contributed a lot of tin in the world. -Okay. -And-- Before you continue, -Mm-hm. -I just wanna know, why did you decide to do this kind of work? Okay. So, the challenges that we face as an island of tin mining, um, you can see here that the miners are discharging the by-product of the tin ore processing into the sea water. [Nuha] It makes me... It makes all Bangkanese, uh, afraid of these things. Tell me about how you sampled. [Jared] How I sampled? So, how I sampled was, so, the behavioral effects of arsenic in soil is they're known to, um, sink through soil at a rate of about two inches per every ten years. So, what I did is, I dug up to a one-foot depth at every sublocation, and I collected three different layers of soil at three different measurements. We made a, uh, a paint. Uh, when the paint is in contact with the sun, there are redox reactions. And the contaminant gases in there are transformed, and they end up as products. This one, uh, was synthesis. We produced the titanium dioxide via sol-gel method. [Jose] And the next one, characterization. We made four tests. And the most important is, X-ray diffraction. Yeah, because we want to be sure that the material was correct in its anatase form. Okay. If you want, I can give you a quick demo of how it works. Well, what were the parameters you were focusing on? Conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, iron, copper, total hardness, total alkalinity, and a few others. Now, why were those parameters chosen? Yeah. So, um, when I looked into several water quality monitoring reports, I saw that across the world, these were some common parameters that everyone monitors first. And this is my prototype. It's really easy for us to make it ourselves. -And then, -Okay. you only put the sea sand here, and then, this is the waste. [Nuha] The waste will go through here. -Mm-hm. -And then, the sand will filter the light ions. And the output is-- -Uh-huh. -Okay, okay. Your waste is, uh, free of light, uh, about 96%. So, are you measuring, like, how do you know what the product is? And how do you know how much is converted? [Jose in Spanish] [Jesus] The photocatalytic reactor... [Jesus in Spanish] [Jesus and Fernando speaking in Spanish] [speaking in Spanish] [Jesus] I don't know how we are gonna say the word. But, well, the photocatalytic reactor register the accretion of the concentration. [Terry] But, do you know what it's looking at? Is it using spectroscopy? Is it, like, what is it using to measure that? [in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] So, in conclusion, the paint works. So, as you can see, we have a real solution for a big problem in the world. So, I've seen TiO2 acting as a photocatalyst before. Do you know how this compares to other, -uh, examples in the literature? -[Jose mumbles] [Jared] Tsunamis have rarely, have a very, very big effect on my family, um... At least three generations of my family have lived through both the 1946 and the 1960 tsunami. They were actually sent running from their home and into a nearby temple, where water actually came and inundated all where they were. I want to do more research and figure out how it affected our community. I found that data talks so much. You can say, "This lake stinks. This lake is terrible. This lake is polluted." Everyone ignores you. But when you say, "Look at this chart. I can show you that because this lake got this amount of pollution, the groundwater next to it got this amount of pollution. And this is the relation to the malaria cases in the area. When you have that kind of data, it really makes a difference, and it makes people listen to you. Which is why I really got excited by this. Because, now I'm actually collecting that kind of data that I can use in that way. And I think that's, that's something that really helps make a difference. [Alma] Sounds exciting. [announcer] ... interview period two. -Thanks for being here. -Thank you. -Bye. -[woman #5] In here... -[indistinct chatter] -[deep breath] I enjoyed talking about your project today. -[Jared] Thank you. -Thank you. -[Jared] Nice meeting you. -Thanks, Nice meeting you, too. Keep going, no matter what happen. Even these things doesn't work, keep doing it, okay? Thank you very much. -All right, bye-bye. -Bye. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Okay, I think we're out of time. Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Good job. -Good luck, you guys. -Thank you. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -Thank you. See you. [Jose whispering] How was it? -[mumbles] -So-so. [calm music] Nice meeting you. -My name is William. -I'm Sahithi. -Sahithi, nice to meet you. -[Sahithi] Nice to meet you. Let's go ahead and get right into your project. -Thank you very much, Jared. -Thank you. Good luck. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. [announcer]This ends period 19. Judges, all of your scores should now be recorded. If any are missing, enter them now. -[Sahithi] Bye. -See ya. [both chuckle] -Bye. -Bye. [light music] [crowd applauding] [cheering] [crowd cheering] [calm music] [in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [exhales deeply] [in Indonesian] [Nuha speaking Indonesian] [in Indonesian] I never realized, you know, how much... the work you put into it. My gosh. I give you a lot of credit, boy. [clicks tongue] Well, Grandma, you're... If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have gotten into this project. How can you say that? You did that. Who took me to Huilua Pond as a kid? Who did I go to when I need to know more about the tsunami? -Mm-hm. -[grandma sniffles] But, Jared, I did all of that because I knew you enjoyed being outdoors. You gotta recognize that you did a lot in this part, too. You need to recognize that. -I don't know-- -I want you to recognize that. As much as you want me to win, I want you to recognize that you helped me get here. Your part wasn't like this. Your part was this. [light music] -[usher #1] Come over here. -[usher #2] Right on over here. Come on... [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, to the award ceremony. There are multiple winners in each of the 22 categories. Plus, best of category awards, grand awards and special awards. In the category of Embedded Systems. [crowd applauding] [announcer] In the category of Animal Sciences. In the category of Energy, Chemical. In the category of Translational Medical Science. In the category of Earth and Environmental Sciences, from Hilo, Hawaii, Jared Goodwin. [crowd cheering, applauding] -Come on, Jared! -[crowd cheering] [cheering continues] [announcer] From Bengaluru, Karnataka, India. Sahithi Pingali. [cheering] [cheering continues] [dramatic music] [in Indonesian] [calm music] -[woman #6] Indonesia! -[all shouting] [chanting in Indonesian] [chanting continues] [clapping, cheering] [grandma] Don't cry. [Jared] Don't cry, Grandma, don't cry. Don't cry. Okay. It's a happy moment. Don't cry, Grandma. [cheering] -Congratulations! -Thanks. Very proud of you, Nana. -Great job. -You did a wonderful job. -So proud of you. -Good job. -Keep it up. -[indistinct chatter] [Jesus] Hey, man. Congrats, you know. -Yeah. Thanks. -Amazing, yeah. [Fernando] Congrats, bye. -Thank you so much. -Thank you. - Feliz to see you. -Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. -[smooches] -Oh. -[Jose] Bye. -[chuckles] Hi! I'm so proud! Congratulations. Congratulations. You're the third award. Oh, my god. -Yeah, but you did so well. -[laughs] [in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] Thank you. Have a safe trip back. -Yeah, sure. You, too. -Bye. -Thank you. -Bye. -Nice seeing you. -[smooches] -[Jose] Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too. [whirring] [Sahithi] Oh, man. I don't know what's going on. Oh, no. Went to the same place, oops. After ISEF, I started a two-month internship here at the University of Michigan. I felt that I needed new resources, and new people, and advice. So, this isn't something I want to drop when I go back to Bangalore in two weeks. I definitely want to continue, and hopefully, this list will grow. -[man #6] All right. -[Sahithi] Questions? I'm blown away by the fact that you're still at, like, high school. [woman #7] It's amazing like... But I just wonder, how are you gonna control for the potential of the public doing the tests incorrectly? So, yeah, we're working one step at a time. But, my thing was more of sitting and coding and doing experiments. But now that, you know, you have to handle the publicizing and the scaling, it's a whole other game. This is a full-time job, Sahithi. How are you gonna manage this? [all laughing] Yeah, at the science fair, there was... There's one thing that keeps coming back to me. Have you heard of Manu Prakash? So he came to my stall, and the thing he told me at the end was, "You can't do it alone. You need to collaborate with others, so it can grow." With science, there's really no value in just creating this data, and creating these inventions, and then just sitting on them. You do need to actually have to make a difference in the world.

[calm music] [Nuha in Indonesian] [in Indonesian] [staff in Spanish] [in Spanish] [staff in Spanish] [in Spanish] [staff in Spanish] [light music] [Jose's mom in Spanish] Hello? [Jose in Spanish] [conversing in Spanish] [Jose's mom in Spanish] [distant chattering] [Jose in Spanish] [teacher in Spanish] [Jose in Spanish] [continues in Spanish] [Jared's dad] Yeah, almost there, Jared. [approaching footsteps] -[Jared] How's that, Dad? -Right here feels good. [rattling] [Jared] I've been to this spot, I've seen it maybe about four or five trips. The first time I came was with my dad. [suspenseful music] [low rumbling] [Jared] I was always taught by my elders to respect the land. [volcano rumbling] [Jared] The feeling the you get being around the lava. It's a sacred feeling. You know you're watching land being created in front of your eyes.
