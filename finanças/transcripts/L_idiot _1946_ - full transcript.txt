The Idiot Can I help you, sir? I would like to see General Epanchin. He doesn't receive anybody. I'm a relative. Really? Yes, I'm Prince Myshkin. You're Prince Myshkin? In person? In person. What a curious expression. I've returned to St. Petersburg after a long stay in Switzerland. If I'm calling at an unsuitable hour, tell me frankly, I'll come back later. Prince, please wait for a moment. The General is in conference. My dear Gania, This chance won't be offered to you a second time. I have to take my family into account. If I announce to them that I'll get married... Nastasia is beautiful enough to justify your choice. Unfortunately it is too well known who had been keeping her... And in such luxury! Loving her without wanting to marry her! Now he wants to get a separation from her. Be so good and come to the point. To atone for my sins, I'm offering Nastasia a dowry of 75.000 roubles. Will you agree to marry her, knowing about her past and this dowry? I'm not sure she'll have me. But she herself gave you her photograph. But withholding her answer. Until tonight. Without doubt, she's angry about the separation, with her ... well... her... Her lover. Yes, that her former lover aspires to become my son-in-law. You see, my dear Gania, we're not hiding anything from you. But making at the same time an honorable marriage, that's a solution she'll realize the advantage of. She'll give her consent tonight. But what about you? Why do you hesitate? Still because of your mother? Is it possible to raise the dowry? It isn't. I'm all for being generous, but within certain limits. Besides, my fortune doesn't belong to me any more... it'll belong to your daughter very soon. - Do you understand my scruples? - They are most honourable. My dear Gania, give us your answer: Yes or no? Your Excellency, I accept. Two times two makes four. The deal is closed. I thank you, my dear friend, for your intervention. Excuse me, I'm expected somewhere else. Monsieur. I'll see you out. So, are you content, my dear? We're rid of her at last. Since she hasn't consented yet... Tonight. You can trust me. He pretends to be a relative of yours. You're really Prince Myshkin? It seems hard to believe. But I'm the Prince. - And I'd like to... - Do come in. I don't know why but I thought you'd died. I had been ill for a long time. Yes, a sort of lymphatism, if I remember correctly. This is putting it kindly. In truth, it took some time for my reason to recover. But the doctor pretends that I'm well. I remember a strange letter you've written to us, impossible to know what you wanted to get at. My wife thought you needed money, my daughters thought you needed affection. I'll be frank, I like things to be precise: two times two makes four. This is my motto, now let's get to the point: Because of my visitors and of my servants I dislike to see in my salon... a relative of my wife dressed like that. I've traveled directly from Lausanne to St. Petersburg. I don't know anybody and my first thought had been... That's too kind. But I have three daughters to marry off and it's an enormous expense. Well, two times two makes four, you don't have any money, you don't have a position, what is it you want of me? Nothing. Prince, do sit down. A candy? Thank you. Tell me about your projects, as if I were your friend. I don't have any. Well, how do you intend to live in Russia? I haven't thought about it ... I have to see the notary who looks after my father's affairs. But your father died penniless! Your carefree attitude worries me. - How old are you? - 26 I thought you were younger. My doctor always told me that I'm be as naive as a child. Am I not fortunate? Well, perhaps, but I dare say... Well, that's none of my business. - Do you know at least where to stay tonight? - I've no idea. Here you are, prince. Accept these 25 roubles from me. - Thank you. - Gania! - Your Excellency. - Come here, will you. Let me present my secretary to you, this is Prince Myshkin. Say, doesn't your mother rent out rooms of her apartment? - She does. - Yes. Well, be so kind... and let the Prince move in with you till his situation improves. My dear, I doubt if Madame la G?n?rale can see you now, she's getting ready to leave for the countryside. But please don't wear those spats on your next visit! Forgive me for being frank, but two times two makes four, I'm a soldier. Prince, I'm expected for breakfast, I wish you good luck. Do you have any luggage to take from the station? No, all I own fits into this handbag. - Really? - Yes. You've come here with nothing at all? And without any project? None. Aren't you afraid? Of what? Russia is my country, I'm home now. Of course, my head isn't very bright, I've read a few books where they talk about the oncoming reforms. It had been so painful to me to be left outside, useless. Don't they need all the men committed to the cause? I've come back to help, to serve. If you're dying to enter the civil service, the General will be able to help you. He knows the chief of the Customs Office very well. Do you have a good hand-writing? Excellent. You see, what I feel passionate about, are the great problems and most of all, justice. Legal clerk. It's possible. But for a Prince, 40 roubles a month... You're kind to interest yourself in my case, can we be friends? It'll always be a pleasure to be able to give you advice. - The General thinks so too, believe it. - He's welcomed me so kindly. Is is wife as affectionate? She's an agitated person, superficial. She loves her daughters, but she adores her dogs. Bobi, slowly. Wearing spats, and a cape? That's amusing. I am sure he's my cousin. But I don't remember how we're related. I hope he got over his madness? He seemed very calm to me. Beware of madmen, they're dangerous. I think they're funny. I knew a stable boy who thought he was the Field marshal Suvorov. He's ruined, but he's a prince. And I've danced with his uncle, Ivan Grigorievich Myshkin who had been in love with me. When did you invite him to see us? My dear, we couldn't possibly receive him. This is funny and sad. But this is what you are, conventional and petty. My dear, I've already asked you, not before the children! Oh, how sensitive you are! Do I take offense at your contempt for my relative who is an authentic prince? You've sent him away. What if I wanted to see him? Aglaia, a fianc?e holds oneself upright. I hope you've given him at least something to help him along? 200 roubles. Always stingy. Where does he live? My dear, I thought it better to deliver you from the bother, I've entrusted him to Gania. But perhaps he's still in my office. Aglaia, have a look if the Prince is still there. And bring him here. With his cape and his spats. Are you alone? Prince, mother would be delighted to see you. I'm her youngest daughter. Aglaia. Where did you find that portrait? On the table. I feel a great attraction to that face. The face of a fallen woman, I despise her. She has suffered a lot. Do you know Nastasia Philipovna? I don't. Then how would you know? I'm seeing you for the first time and I know you're happy. With her, it's the opposite. Be so good and put away that portrait. That woman deserves no attention at all, no compassion. If she's good, she might still be saved. What do you mean? I don't know. Very often, children, when seeing a stranger for the first time... cry out loud, which the grown-ups don't understand, they can't explain it but their feelings are unerring. I'm a little like them. I hope I haven't displeased you? You astonish me. You eyes have a colour I find touching. Prince, mother is expecting us. - You're taking the Prince with you? - For breakfast. Your father has told me of your engagement. I'd like to be the first to congratulate you. Thank you, Gania. Prince, I'll meet you later, I'll take you home and I'll introduce you to my mother and my sister. Sophie, don't be too strict. You must admit that he's hesitating and that he's not lost yet. And Gania is a good son. He's weak. Loving one's parents is one thing, but respecting them is another. But Nastasia has fallen so low... She's just a proud woman who likes to shock public opinion. I've seen her once in the theatre, such an ostentatious gown, such jewels. Even the way she ate her candy was a provocation. I'm afraid I've made the arm too wide. You have all the virtues, Sophie. But you don't know how to forgive those who have less virtues than yourself. I have the same age as Nastasia. I'm not ugly! I spend my life making beds, sweeping floors, ironing! And as a reward I'm getting a sort of prostitute as... - Sophie! Gania has come back. I've warned you, it's not very elegant. - By my sister likes a place to be clean. - Indeed. It's her obsession. Here's your room. Sophie, may I present Prince Myshkin, our new lodger. My sister. Don't be trouble yourself, you can go on with your cleaning. I'll show the Prince to his room myself. Would you like to come in? In here please. I hope you like the room. It's bright. A pleasant view. Your things can be stored easily in the closet. Why do you mock your sister? She's taking such pains. Just for fun. She's used to it. You're hurting her every time? What do you know about it? I've felt it. My mother, on the other hand, is all goodness. You must pay the rent to her. Not to my father, he's careless. I've warned you, he's very talkative. Often telling stories which aren't true. If he asks you for money please refuse, in a friendly manner. I will. Yes... he drinks, you see... Under no circumstances, don't advance him anything! Is that from Switzerland? It's a gift from a group of children, the only friends I had down there. When I hear the cuckoo sing, I remember their voices. I'd like to hang it in here. Do as you like, it's your room. - Thank you. - I'll fetch a hammer and a nail. Come in. General Ivolgin. Retired and in distress. Prince, here's the hammer you've asked for. But you shouldn't have taken the trouble. It's a pleasure to be of service to the son of an old friend. You knew my father? He served with the 13th Narva cavalry regiment. That's it, I was going to mention it myself. Andrej and I have been inseparable. My father's name was Leon. Leon, sure, Leon, Leon over here, Leon over there, always Leon. During the Crimean war, I've saved his life twice. You wanted to hang the cuckoo clock with this? Yes. Where do you want it? Over there? So that I can see it from my bed. Let me do it, it's very easy. Thank you. Did Gania warn you? Warn me? Not to lend me money under any circumstances. I know my weakness and I'm not offended. But the truth is, I'm too generous. I just thought I'd mention it, and even if I begged for it don't you give me even 10 kopecks. At this height? Thank you. I also knew your mother very well. You did? Andrej and I... Leon and I, we both loved her. What a tragedy. We'd decided that one of us ought to leave. A duel with swords, until death, blindfolded. The witnesses were panting with excitement. Then we fell into each other's arms. Here you are, this will hold the clock. The friendship of two brothers in arms had been stronger than the love for a woman. - Hand me the clock. - Here it is. Thanks Does he sing? Of course he sings. There you are. Done. It furnishes the room. And it fills it with a little friendly presence. It's a good thing. Yes it is. Prince... If I told you that I knew a widow mother of four children, not having any bread whom I wanted to help, you mustn't believe me. But... could you refuse the soldier who saved your father's life four times some roubles so that he could buy himself a similar cuckoo clock? Here you are. 25 roubles? Oh, Prince, I don't know what to say... If such a simple object can move you to tears I think we'll be friends. What are they quarreling about? Not again! Always Gania and his sister. They are breaking my heart. But I don't interfere any more. And when they're shouting at each other I lock myself into my room. I don't know, remind me. It's not my fault if you forget... I can marry whom I like. Do just like me. Remain deaf and blind. The bell doesn't work. What are you waiting for, fix it! Aren't you going to help me? Don't stand there dreaming. I wonder why they haven't thrown you out long ago. Excuse me, Nastasia Philipovna. You know me? How so? Anyway, I don't care, announce me. If you insist... How dare you answer me in that tone, if you were my servant I'd... What's that shouting? They are quarreling because of you. Because of me? - Shut up, leave me in peace! - I've warned you! If you bring her here, I'm leaving! Out of spite, is that it? Out of foolishness, I can't stand you any longer. Did I leave for that? - Go then, nobody's keeping you. - Mother is! - She's the only one. - Gania! - Hypocrite! You pretend to love her and you force her to chose between her son and her daughter! - Sophie! You love her! And whom do you want to bring her, seat at our table? Nastasia Philipovna. My dear Gania, why do you look like a beaten puppy? Come on, introduce me! My mother. I know of your goodness, Madame, your generosity. May they plead in favour of me. May you be welcome. Thank you, Madame. My sister. Gania told me you loved music, I too adore music, we shall go to concerts together. I detest music. If you intended to offend me, it's done. So much for the better, now you can smile. Madame, each of us has heard a lot about the other. Have I been wrong to bring about this meeting so that we get to know each other really well? I like your frankness. But you might have warned me. To give everybody time to compose himself? No, now we all know what everybody really thinks, down to the servant who just opened the door with his eyes popping out in amazement. This is our new lodger, Prince Myshkin. You've mistaken him because of his appearance. Prince, forgive me for my insolence. How did you know me? This morning... I've seen your photographed portrait You might have told me who you were. But you didn't let me put in a single word. You're too timid. No, by discovering in your real face the same signs of desperation... How so? I... - So I'm a desperate woman? - You are. Your voice, your laughter is certain proof of that. Excuse the Prince. He has more sensitivity than judgment. - Your lodgers must be a great source of entertainment. - Of exhaustion, that would be more to the point! But what do you know about the difficulties of those who have to earn their living? But that's exactly the purpose of my visit. I wanted to know the background of Gania's life, the people he lives with. Honest people. - And also kind and loving. - Yes, being kind and loving, I admit, that's more your line. - Sophie, your rancor exasperates me and I warn you... - You've already done so and I've warned you myself... It's not my fault, this provocation - Enough! This is my house, and as long as I... - Sophie! - Be careful! - Children, I beg of you, it's such a beautiful day. Allow me to present my homages and the compliments of a father who is overjoyed to receive another beloved daughter into his family very soon. You're kind. You should know that my father says anything when he's drunk. Sophie, I find your language distressing. Look how beautiful she is... and distinguished. - I think it's a joy, a gift from heaven... - Father, I beg of you, go to your room and lie down. You see. They always want to shut me up. - Me who has danced the mazurka with the Empress - Nicolas. - Nicolas. They are all my enemies. Ever since I lost my immense fortune. And I used to be like this, before I sold my palaces, my lakes my hunting grounds to help the widows of my old comrades in arms. So help me God! - And if I've become the keeper of a boarding house ... - Father, I implore you! I've guessed why she has come here. Don't make a spectacle of yourself and go to your room! But she's listening with sympathy to what I'm saying. She's making fun of you. I can read her thoughts, she's delighted that everything's ugly in here and that we're ridiculous. It's her triumph! But not so fast, Nastasia Philipovna! I could visit you and shame you in return! Dare show us your furniture, your carpets, your chandeliers! - Tell us how you've earned them! - Sophie! But I was going to invite you all to my house tonight. I accept with greatest pleasure. I refuse to enter your house. Leave us. Your presence is an insult to my mother and to myself! You're doing this on purpose to exasperate me! To ruin everything! But you've gone too far, you're going to apologize! - I? - At once! Do you hear! - Or rather... - Never! You disgust me! Enough! Now the idiot too... How you must be ashamed. Gania. You shouldn't have done that. Prince, forgive him. All this has happened because of my fault. What about yourself, aren't you ashamed? You're not like you just made us believe, it's not possible. Come and see me tonight, you'll understand. Madame, remember what the Prince just said. Perhaps your daughter is wrong. Allow me. Nobody should go into any trouble because of me. - I must speak to you. - No. What will be your answer tonight? Come, you'll learn about it soon enough. As soon as you'll be my wife I'll leave this house. I won't see Sophie again. What do I care. Tonight you'll say yes? 9 o'clock, bring your father. And the Prince, if he agrees. Bravo, bravo, Daria. You've played like an angel. And without looking at the score once. - In my regiment we had a musician... - It's 11 o'clock. Nastasia Philipovna. This is the hour you gave us when you would let us have your answer. When the executioner grabbed Madame du Barry by her hair to place her under the guillotine, do you know what she said? One moment please, Mister Executioner. One moment please, General. What has his drama to do with your marriage? Nothing. My dear, your hesitations and tantrums make me think... You? Thinking? My dear, during the eight years when I've been you concubine... ah, please! when we've been living our great love, I've seen you eating, drinking, sleeping, snoring, but never thinking, upon my word! - Give me your hand. - No. - You're feverish, you'll do something foolish. - Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Prince, you don't smoke? Never. And you, my little Gania, darling? How pale you are! Are you angry with me because I mentioned my past affair? But you know everything already, don't you? And you're thinking that with a man of the world like Totsky there must have been things going on quite often and that your little fianc?e... I implore you! You're not going to slap my face? Very well. For a husband you'll do. That's enough, Nastasia. I've heard the story of a doe hunted by hounds and riders. She had been fleeing for hours, with the hounds and the hunters on her tracks. Suddenly the god of the hunters appeared before her and said: Why tire out these sturdy hounds, these nice gentlemen? Why make them sweat blood and water before they're going to devour you anyway? Stop this cruel game. And she lay down. So I'll stop making you impatient. With whom do you want me to lie down? That's well put. We're dealing with your future daughter-in-law. At last. Be patient for just a few seconds more. Here you are. Parfion Semyonovich Rogozhin. Wholesale flour merchant. Friends of mine. For weeks this man had been pursuing me, I thought he wouldn't be out of place here tonight. For the auction. Rogozhin is offering 100.000 roubles for me. I've brought them, if you want more, I'll get you more. Your wish is my command. He doesn't have the same upbringing as you gentlemen, but he's generous. Rogozhin offers 25.000 roubles more that Totsky to get rid of me. Where's my interest? My dear Totsky, was this your last offer? You must be crazy. I'm talking business for once, it's about my life, my own skin. A pretty skin, Gania. Cool in summer, warm in winter. Didn't Totsky tell you? This calls for a little extra effort. Gentlemen, who bids more? The auction is opened. I'll pay whatever you're asking for. I love that woman and I'll have her. You shall have her if your bid is highest. But you're just a tradesman and certain things are beyond your grasp. They are offering me an honourable life in a bourgeois family. A General for a father-in-law, how many thousands of roubles is that worth? - Nastasia Philipovna, allow me to take my leave. - No! Your embarrassment comes too late. In order to marry off your daughter, you've prepared the affair, discussed the details, and now you're acting the squeamish gentleman? Understanding my friend Totsky's scruples, I only tried to help him undo his wrongs. Do you seriously believe one can undo a rape? That scrupulous Totsky, that godfather sent from heaven to watch over me has profited of my 16 year old innocence to abuse me. He's treated me like his whore for eight years. But I'm still beautiful! How much is this worth? Prince... Prince, what do you think? A rape committed under scruples, how many roubles does that pay? Nastasia Philipovna, do you want to become my wife? You're unhappy, but you're not guilty. You... You don't have the right to humiliate me. I'm offering you my name, my fortune. I've just seen my notary who wrote to me in Switzerland, an aunt has left me 2 million roubles. I love children. I love animals, most of all deer. Be my wife. Don't touch her! That woman belongs to me. Prince, you've felt pity for me. I thank you. But I've fallen so low, I don't deserve pity any more. That one wouldn't feel pity for me anyway. But I shall belong to him, because he desires me most of all. - That's enough, let's go. - Wait. There's one thing I must do yet. Gania, you are madly in love with money. For money you'd do anything. Even marry me. And I was going to steal from you. Show us how low you can get, and these 100.000 roubles are yours. Ours. I'm a lost woman, everything you gave me, Totksy, I'm giving it back to you now, your furniture, your carpets, your chandeliers. And this packet, Gania, it's yours. Fetch it! 100.000 roubles. Holy Mother of God. Gania, the money is going to burn. What are you waiting for, Gania? Let me get it. Shut up! Make up your mind, the packet starts burning. Think of your mother... Your old mother, almost paralyzed. You renounce? So you're worth a bit more than I thought. Some banknotes are slightly burnt. But you've earned them well! They're ours, my dear son. Adieu, prince. You're the first real man I've ever met. Now, Rogozhin, take me quickly away from here, and very far. Wherever you want to go. Let's go! Gania, you might help me. How much have you already stolen from me? Did you understand what's been going on here? One crazy woman, one brutal man and a simpleton. But look at him! He's crying, and he's inherited 2 millions. Your health! Ah, very nice. But careful! If you spoil my wedding dinner, I'll cut off your moustaches and your ears. Look at him! Ah, he's great. Igor, the conjuror. Very good. That's Vassily. Ask him for any song, he knows them all. And Athanasy. Cards, dice, he knows every game. That's Sergei. All he does is drink, Sergei. How long it's been since you've been sober last? Like the five fingers of a hand, always together, always of the same opinion! This is Rogozhin's gang. Your health! Order some more drinks, Sergei. Now I can admit that they were all against you. The things they've invented to make me change my mind. And I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, and it went on and on. It had been you I needed, just you. Don't get soft. I've become a member of the Rogozhin gang. What else do you want? Who's he? I have the honour to salute very humbly the noble members of the party. If I may present myself: Lukyan Timofeyevich Lebedyev. Chased out of the administration for drunkenness. So what, we prefer tipplers to civil servants! Then I ask you to contemplate a thing which is quite rare: The ultimate drunkard. I've drunk away my parent's fortune, then my wife's dowry. I've drunk away her furniture, our bed, my children's clothes. And it's a great mystery. I'm even more thirsty. Sit down and have a drink with us. Your health, gentlemen, and to the health of the very noble lady. Thank you. Tonight, in my apartment where we sleep on the floor, where we sit on the floor, I've tried in vain to find something to sell. I only found this book. This is a very holy bible which had been given to my mother the day I was born. If I sell it for some roubles, I'm not offending my mother or God. They both are dear to my heart and they both show deep understanding for their unfortunate son who is always thirsty. Who wants to buy it? He can name any price. Buy that bible for me. If you want to. 100 roubles, alright? Ah, sir. May God bless you. I like drunkards when they sing or are merry. That one disgusts me. You've made me afraid. Parfion. Look. A knife. In the bible. My friends... My children... I am getting emotional... as I had been afraid to... having to part with you... But a great love unites you with a loving husband. - After all, it's God who... - Nikolai Pavlovich Prince, you'll address your compliments after the blessing. - After all, it's God who shall take you... - Nikolai Pavlovich... Have you forgotten your manners abroad, Prince? - It is customary that the head of the family... - Nikolai Pavlovich. Don't involve God in your deals. He's going crazy again. You look only after your own business affairs, you don't have any compassion for the misery and the suffering of others, but please spare the innocent ones. Nikolai Pavlovich, this is about your own daughter! Look into her eyes, look into her face, have pity on her. My dear friends, you must excuse the Prince. Since his illness he lives in a state of agitation. I've been kept abroad for five years because of my illness. I have started loving my country each day a bit more. They were talking of great reforms, of a solidarity giving everybody an equal chance of happiness. These words are on your lips, but they don't find an echo in your hearts. With what hopes I've started my voyage from abroad! And everywhere I meet nothing but hypocrisy, meanness, indifference! You, and you, and all of you! Do you realize how thin the ice is you're skating on? What abyss is below? What catastrophe is awaiting you? Prince, it's too hot in here, come with me. Take my arm. We've invited him because he's a relative of mine. But he doesn't know what he's saying. Let's forget it, our friends have understood perfectly. Haven't you? Aglaia, it's God who... It's God who perhaps... well... Ah, my children, a father who adores you may well have the right to bless you. A few sacks more and you can have your lunch break. Eh, you good-for-nothing! You're resting? Do I pay you to sit? I've worked without a break for seven hours. But so have I. This is the young generation. But your father never spoke to me like that. Forgive me, little father. Have a drink. Hurry up. Pachka, you can go now! And give him a hand to get going! - Here you are, I've been expecting you. - Here's the commission. A surprise for the princess. Let Vassily wash up, come with me. She's staying with you? Sure. I thank you for the intention but I'd rather not. Do you have scruples? You make me laugh. I don't see you around anymore, but it's for another reason. Does Nastasia love you more now? She can't stand us. Why, did she tell you so? No...she told you. You're trying to arrange this hoping she'll get used to it. A woman in Rogozhin's gang, it's impossible! Why? You'll see. We'll meet again one day. One day... Not tomorrow We'll be waiting for you. Give our love to the other fellows. I'll go in now, she's waiting for her surprise. - Who am I? - Don't be foolish. - Guess. - You're hurting me. My delicate princess. How is she? I'm reading the cards without cheating. I don't care at all about my future. I'm bored. None of that! Find something else to distract me. This for example. - What is it - Open it! More diamonds. Every stone is worth 1.000 sacks of flour. You're thinking and talking like a merchant. For this, a lot of wheat grain had to be seeded and cut. Then it had to be ground. It had to be carried here and it had to be sold. This represents a lot of toil. They are yours for a smile. You're selling them to me for a smile? Loving isn't like that. Giving isn't like that. For a smile. For nothing! Take your presents and your jewels! This is what I shall do with them! I'll stamp on them, crush them into dust, into flour! Careful, those stones are hard. It would be a pity if you hurt your feet. So it's tears now, is it? This is an act I'm beginning to get familiar with. Do you know why you're crying at all? The diamonds are not big enough? One word. Just one word from you which might touch me. And I'll forgive you for what you are. Words. Always words, like the Prince. His heart on his lips, his empty stare and bleating like a sick lamb. No! - A man is not like that... - No use explaining, I know what men are like. - So there's nothing to complain. - Don't touch me! Let go of me! Now you're going to listen to me! True, I'm a merchant, and you're better than me. I love you, I don't have a choice. Either I'll conquer you or I'll kill you. Sometimes love arises out of love-making. And in lust there isn't any princess, nor any merchant. What about waking up? Did you think about that? What do you mean? There will surely be a moment when we will regain our senses. I'm asking if that moment doesn't trouble you. Don't get me wrong. I'm not rejecting you. Kill Natasia with her scruples and her regrets about being Rogozhin's wife. Just an animal like the others. That's what I probably am. In the same gesture we both are looking for peace: you in life, I in death. Does this frighten you? I have more courage than you. - Mother - What is it? You were asleep? What made you think that? You weren't speaking. You know very well that I never sleep nowadays. I have too many worries. All those dinners, and your father, and the dogs who have to get shaved. But my hairdresser refused, he even told me... But what is it? I've received a letter. From whom? From the Prince. To apologize? That's right. Show it to me. I've burnt it. I received it yesterday, I've read it at least a hundred times. Finally I've destroyed it I have to think about it all the time. The Prince ought to know that he cannot write letters to a young girl who is engaged. Adelaida! You're accelerating the movement too much. What does he say in his letter? "Aglaia, I have nothing to tell you and no reason to write to you. But his morning is so beautiful that I'd like to know if you are happy. Where are you? What's going to become of you under the great blue sky? I am your brother..." First of all, he's your cousin. Secondly, I fail to understand what the sky has got to do with it. I don't know... Look into my eyes, Aglaia. You couldn't possibly be in love with that simpleton? You wouldn't want to give birth to degenerate children? I've enough worries with your father and your sisters. And is anybody going to help me? Nobody asks me what I'm doing under the blue sky? His eyes are beautiful. Agreed, and he has small feet. That I've noticed, but he's an idiot! Are you still hesitating about that? How can you live in such a gloomy house? I get up late, I live mostly during the night, with the lights on. - Sit down. -Yes. I've heard you were going to leave for the country. Tomorrow I'll be leaving for Pavlovsk. That's where the Epanchin family stays, isn't it? Yes. With their daughters. Yes indeed. But when General Ivolgin told me you wanted to see me... Did he tell you that Rogozhin is against our meeting? As soon as your name in mentioned he gets furious, be careful, he's violent. But we have nothing to quarrel about. He's jealous of anybody. I wanted to warn you before thanking you. Yes, that evening. The atmosphere had been charged and we all said something foolish. But you've caught the ponpon (???) Yes, I'm very clumsy. How you've been mistaken about me! Women of my kind are always play-acting. I only played that scene to exasperate Rogozhin and get the maximum profit out of him, do you realize that now? By burning the 100.000 roubles, by leaving Totsky everything he gave you? Prince, you must risk something if you want to collect the chandeliers, playing the hunted doe, the abandoned woman. Shall I tell you what I got out of Rogozhin's love for me after just one month? These earrings... worth thousands of flour sacks This bracelet, this brooch... representing acres of wheat. I love only jewels. And I can get more of them whenever I want. So, tell me, have I done well? You the most unhappy woman I know. How naive you are! You ought to know what such a little pebble is worth, and the casket is full of them. The most destitute woman I know. The most destitute? - But you are blind! - You know very well that I've seen through you from the first moment. By laughing even louder, I could only hear you cry out for help, and from far away. That's why I came. Prince. What should I do? Look at wounded animals, the way they just lick their wounds. You're wearing your wounds with pride. And you keep on fingering them, making them bleed. What should I do? Forgive those who had made you suffer. And you'll be delivered from the evil which they have done to you. That's impossible. Why? It only depends on yourself. I'm convinced that the pardon wipes out the wound and the wrong committed. Be simple, re-discover the world. It's too late. I no longer deserve a word of pity, a word of hope. and if I were you... Ah, so the visitor had been you! I turn my back and off you go! What business do you have in here? Parfion. He's told you pretty words. Well, now it's my turn to speak up. First of all... Don't get carried away, I've asked him to come here. You did? Yes. To end your suspicions once for all. Look! I've shown him everything you gave me. And I repeat it before you: You're making me happy and I adore you. That's all I had to say to him. She's proud of her jewels, isn't she? Like all the other women. They all act like coquettes. They prefer delicate attentions, but still they aren't above showing off their little treasures to pure spirits of your kind. Why do you keep pursuing her? I'm not your rival, you know that very well. What are you doing here then? I had to give her peace, Parfion. Do you imagine a flour merchant is so dumb that he doesn't understand that this is worse than wanting to sleep with her! But for you it's better this way, I can assure you that. Now I know her through and through. The other women act capricious too around the bed, but there are moments when you can reach them, but her, never! You press her tight, you think you hold her - gone, escaped... And it's your fault! And you dare try to reform her in here, you've come to oppose me in my own house! How much hate there is in your eyes! Oh, I don't know any longer. I wouldn't even tell my best friend what I told you. Do you understand it perhaps? Oh no, I only hoped to see you here. I can understand you very well, you know. I love you too. Not so fast! Before getting emotional you ought to know there are often moments when I think of killing you. Yes, I could feel it. And you came all the same? To show you that this is only an obsession which torments you. - You will never commit it. - You think so? You see this knife? I take it so often in my hand. And I imagine. No, I don't want to, don't drive me to it, go away! You know, the evening when you took Nastasia with you, I felt lonely at the boarding house and I got lost walking in the streets It had been my first night in Russia after my return I met a drunken soldier who offered me a silver cross for 20 kopecks. The cross was made of tin and wasn't worth the price, but I agreed all the same and I hung the chain round my neck. The drunkard had been delighted to have cheated me, he ran to the vodka shop to spend the money on drink. That hurt. Continuing my walk I met a very poor woman holding a baby in her arms. The baby had just smiled at her for the first time. I saw that peasant woman suddenly crossing herself. I asked her why, and that simple woman, like million other women in our country, answered: "The joy a mother feels at the smile of her baby is the same God feels each time he hears a sinner praying deep in his heart." This emotion God has for his creature, this is the teaching of Christ. Parfion, God sees you. You can break his heart, like the soldier did. Or you can please him. I came to bring you peace, but I won't come again. Adieu. Wait. That cross, are you wearing it? Always. Show it to me. Would you give it to me? Yes. Would you give me yours in exchange? Yes. We shall be brothers. From now on, I won't be able to think of killing you. Thank you. Can I tell Nastasia that we're friends now? It's the truth. Go away now. You're my brother, but you'd better not ask too much of me, go now. Nastasia! Nastasia! Where are you? Nastasia! Nastasia! Nastasia! Nastasia! Will you leave the cuckoo clock hanging in here? I will. I'll ask you to keep it for me while I'm looking after my affairs. It's a great pleasure to be of service to you. By the way, I've been wanting to ask you, for an old soldier who lost his leg serving his fatherland. I've left an envelope, just in case. I'll let you know my new address from Pavlovsk. I shall never forget this room. Prince. This has been a great honour for us. And I thank you for the help I shall immediately convey to my poor leg-less friend. You should be more careful, your soldier only lost one leg serving the fatherland. Prince, he had already lost the first one serving the Czar. Your good care will restore both to him. I'm sure of it. Adieu. She left because of you. Parfion. Come down. I don't believe it! It's not possible. Now really, Tamara Pavlovna tries to slip by unnoticed... We've been detesting each other for 20 years. The stubborn hypocrite! Vladimir Petrovich, Do you love military music? - In truth... - I adore it. It's the only music I can enjoy. I love amusing things, round sounding, done with taste. How do you explain that my daughters resemble me so little? Perhaps they take after the General? After the General. Evidently it's not impossible. Aglaia my child, what are you thinking of? I'm admiring a pretty woman. Don't you think she's charming, Vladimir Petrovich? My dear Aglaia, when I'm near you... You respect her only now because you can no longer see her (???) Aglaia, your gesture hasn't displeased me. On the contrary. But your father will be furious, and for once... your father will be right. Take them with you, I'll rejoin you presently. Prince, I thought you had been ill. Yes I was, I've come here to get some rest. Pavlovsk is an agreeable place. And she's delightful. Whom are you talking about? Prince, when General Ivolgin told me about the wedding ceremony and your intervention I immediately understood, even before you did, before she did. And I only came here to prove my gratitude to you. I don't understand what you're talking about. Today it's my turn to see clear about you. You're the most unhappy of men. I am? Yes, and the poorest. Who else could have told you all this if I hadn't come? Prince, let me arrange your happiness. You're still feverish, Nastasia. Oh, but that's of no importance now. No, don't talk to me any more, I don't count any more, it's she She's there, waiting for you, go to her, go. She won't marry Totsky. I'm delighted to see you in good health. But you must give me your word that you like military music. Are you still angry with me, Madame? Not at all. But Totsky... what a scandal during his engagement ceremony... Such a kind man. He's taking my dogs for a walk right now. May I sit down beside you? What have you been doing all this time? Haven't you guessed by my letter? And what has become of you under the great blue sky? You know it. Very early in the morning, there's nobody in the park. I shall be there, sitting on a bank. That one back there, can you see it? Tomorrow morning very early I'll wait for you there. I'm not a bad shot. But after supper I'm even better! The Lieutenant has shown us his tricks, now you show us yours! What's your specialty? Spending my father's money. What about you? I'm his friend, I'm spending his father's money! Vodka! Which one shall I kill to start with? But you told me that we were going to amuse ourselves, I want to amuse myself! - I can't, I've had too much to drink. - Get up! - How much do you weigh? - More than 100 pounds! Come! Nastasia! Help me! It's you? I recognize your style. Where is he? Is he here? No. But you've come to Pavlovsk to be with him again. No! Why did you leave then? You did it only because of him, didn't you? You'll never understand anything! Agreed. But one thing has changed now, I'm no longer trying to understand. Get dressed, you shall come back with me! I won't. - I have something to do here. - I can see that. Now you can complain about Rogozhin's gang. If he had been there, he'd surely have made you a princess a second time. And don't try to explain anything to me! No, enough of those discussions, or I'll go crazy myself. He's made us all ill. I don't know what he is, perhaps a scoundrel, perhaps an angel, I don't care any more... I'm like a horse, a horse with blinders, I see just what's right before me I'll stay on the ground I know well, you won't catch me on the side tracks again! You know what'll happen to you if you refuse? I know. And don't you think it'll be better if you got dressed like a good girl and came home with me? I am ill, it's true. And I must live my illness to its limit, then I shall know whether I can get well again. I got furious when I saw you two together. But I'm not angry at you. Listen to me. I'm making an effort to explain to you for the last time. You've had affairs in the past, you've been unhappy. And along comes that fool who, out of the blue, proposes to marry you, but remember... I too wanted only you when I saw you for the first time. Him and I, we're alike. But I've accepted you like you are, with all your misfortunes. If you want to marry me, it's fine with me. You, you've bought me. But you've wanted it yourself! You're always telling me that I'm a merchant, but you know what money means for a merchant! I've given you mine so that you may burn it. Do you want any more to throw into the fire? And the only thing I care about is you. But you've never talked to me like this before. Perhaps I'm changed. You have. Ever since you've met him. Do you want to drive me crazy! No!. You've got me thinking about him all the time, that's another thing. I would never have thought it possible that I might kill a man. And now it's become an obsession. As soon as my plans are opposed! You, him, anybody. This is his power: always placing us between the best and the worst... and forcing us to chose. Did you chose? It takes a long time. And it's difficult. But I've chosen. Having affairs with the military. Let's not quarrel any more. Either you come with me, we'll get married and live like everybody else... or... Parfion, I'll marry you! Really? Wait. The day he'll marry Aglaia. - Oh, new complications. - No, there's only one thing to do, to say. Only one word. No, no Don't ask, let me go. If you try to fool me, if you'll rejoin him... Trust me. I'll wait for you here. I'll be back in an hour. well? You'll stay with her? You'll take her with you? Or will you come with us? I don't know. I was looking at the foreign newspapers in the reading room when the Prince had himself announced An undertaking which shows a noble feeling. Wait. I meet him, all disposed to make my peace with him, when he tells me: "Vladimir Petrovich, I've come to tell you that I don't feel any sympathy for you." "This feeling is so strong, I had to tell you personally.". What would you have answered in my place? I would have answered "Two times two makes four". "Either you've come to insult me, and we shall be dueling with swords... "or you don't know what you're saying and your words are null and void." No, I've answered in a rather funny way, I think: "My dear Prince, same here". What a brilliant answer! A crushing remark indeed. And such verve. Oh, my children, don't be so nervous. Excuse them, my dear. There's a storm approaching. - Vladimir Petrovich, I'd like to talk to you. - Ah, this game doesn't please me any more. It's about an important affair which regards you personally. I'm having supper with friends, I must ask you to excuse me, Madame. You've always been so generous to me... that I've intercepted in your favour. I must ask you to leave me in peace. Once for all. My dear Totsky, but it's in your own interest. Would you permit me to speak in front of your friends? Aglaia, you were wrong at the concert. Now you see the consequences. Adelaida, sit down. We certainly won't give way. Alexandra, eat your supper! This music is adorable. Don't you think so? May I have some wine, my friend. Vladimir Petrovich, I wanted to tell you now to worry any more. But do have some of that fish. I'd love to. Have some more of that fish, and don't worry about your bills-of-exchange, Rogozhin has just bought them. He'll grant you a delay. Which bills of exchange? Unimportant slander. What are you talking about? I haven't put any bills of exchange in circulation. You have, until two hours ago. I have nothing else to say to you. Good evening. If you hadn't restrained me I'd have slapped her face... whipped her! Women like that shouldn't be allowed to enter the restaurant. But what letters of exchange had she been talking about? Forgive me if I've hurt you. You're beautiful. You're pure, you're perfect, and I'm not angry at you, on the contrary. May God keep me from passing judgment on anybody, I'm too inexperienced. It hadn't been my good fortune that life gave me too much experience, too early. I'd be happy if my experience might be of assistance to you. But I have parents to advise me. They want to marry you to someone you don't love, who doesn't deserve you, they know it, but they go through with it all the same. I haven't said my last word yet. Nobody ever hears the pitiful last word of a young well-bred girl. - But I like you, and I've come to help you. - By creating an unnecessary scandal? It wouldn't have been of any use if I had shouted before everybody what that man has done to me, nobody would have cared. Nobody would have dared not taking sides with Vladimir Petrovich. But an insignificant remark will make even his best friends drop him. And make your parents hesitate to give their daughter to him in marriage. I've given you back your freedom, profit by it. What exactly is a letter of exchange? A sort of IOU. Then Vladimir Petrovich isn't rich? He is perhaps a bit troubled in his business affairs. But he gave me his word of honour that the whole affair had been a pure fabrication. Careful, you are going to give your daughter to a man who has financial troubles. As long as I'm alive, my children's fate won't be decided by a throw of the dice. By the way, Aglaia doesn't love him and I think he's stupid. Since the letters of exchange have turned up. There's something false in the way his eyes look and he has flat feet. But you knew about this. Of course I did. But when a misfortune arrives to others, one is more indulgent. I dislike him intensely. Since he has acquired letters of exchange. You're getting on my nerves with you cigarettes! Not only does Aglaia not love him, but she loves another. - Whom? - The Prince. The idiot? Is this a game? Or are you really asleep? Prince. Prince. I've fallen asleep. I had been so afraid to be late that I came here when it was still dark. I saw the break of day. Did you know that the trees are praying at daybreak? I've felt it for the first time in my life. And you were sleeping? I've come in secret, with my heart beating. And you've received my badly... It's true, I was sleeping, but is there a better way to show you my confidence? How come that everything is so simple to you... and so complicated to the others? To you too? Prince, it's not easy to be a well-bred young girl. They take us for silly girls, at home and outside. They think we have no passions because we keep silent... without a will of our own, because we obey. I don't want to be a General's daughter. I shall never be what my father has planned for me when he raised the icon to bless me and Totsky. Waiting for the sky to turn ... all black, for the thunder to crash. I've heard your voice. Ever since that moment I've been waiting for you. I know. Answer me with one word. Do you love me? Yes. Did you know that I love you? Yes. I wanted so much to tell you: "Take my hand and take me with you wherever you want." This is how it should happen between us. Prince, it's not my fault, but first you must take me to her. To her? I want to see her with you. I have only two words to say to her. It's impossible. Why? I know she loves you. And you? How shall I explain? I'd give my life to give peace to her soul, but I don't feel any love for her. Then take me to her at once. You must surely have guessed the reason for my visit. I haven't. I've come with the Prince to announce our engagement. My congratulations. Thank you, but I'd also like to clear up a misunderstanding. You think you've done me a great service yesterday evening, but it's not true. You're imagining that you've accomplished a splendid action by provoking Totsky. It's not true, I should have accomplished my happiness even without you. Don't be presumptuous. Neither the Prince nor I ever asked for your help. I don't owe you anything. Don't be ungrateful. My happiness is immense. Didn't you know that I'd rather lose it that having to owe you anything? It would have been soiled. What do you know about me that gives you the right to judge me? Your whole life, your misfortunes... your lover has left you, what a catastrophe really. But if I had been in your place, in order to get rid of a Totsky, I'd have become... a housekeeper, a sweeper, anything. And to end it all, I'd have found someone better than that one over there. I found better, just imagine! A Prince. - But I didn't want him, so that some foolish girl might have him instead! - The Prince doesn't love you, he told me so! And I took you for an angel. Before raising your voice, you try to suffer for an hour, only for a minute. You'd change your tone then. And don't overestimate your strength. - Since you've wanted to show off your victory, you must be worried. -I? Terribly jealous of a thing which escapes you. - What has happened between the Prince and myself? - Nothing. Not one rendezvous, not one kiss. - But something which makes you tremble so much that you've come here to find out which of us he prefers! - But you've preferred him! My little demoiselle, I thought you more intelligent. If I consent to marry that one over there, it's only to free the Prince of his promise. What if I changed my mind? You've wanted to revenge yourself and to humiliate me arriving her arm in arm with your hero. Shall I tell Rogozhin "Go away, rejoin your gang, it's over"? Shall I say just one word to the Prince, just one word, and you'll run home all alone, crying? Listen to me. Either you'll acknowledge sincerely that you both owe your happiness to me and that I'm paying a terrible price for it. Or you'd better be on your guard! You're hesitating? You want me to hold him to his promise? Prince. You must answer her. What are you waiting for? I cannot, Aglaia. She's so unhappy. You'll never see me again. Aglaia! Let her go, she wanted it so. Save me! Save me, now I want to get well. Don't leave me! I'll stay, but... I'll stay as long as necessary. You'll marry me here, before everybody who has humiliated me. And I'll be dressed in white. Yes, I'll dare to. All the bells shall ring like for any other wedding, and I'll be in white like all the other brides. You want that, don't you? You want that, don't you? Yes, I promised. I always thought red was your colour. Red and black. But white too. When trying on this dress just now... I saw in the mirror the little girl who went to church on Easter night. Poor little girl. They have cheated her, they have soiled her, and she has fallen so low... that she has lost all hope. Then you came. Look how well I fell, calm. Touch my shoulder. Totsky took my by violence. For eight years, every time he came near me, I wanted to cry out. Rogozhin... I had been his creature. Do you know that he would have killed me? Your hand is soft. Why don't you kiss me? Because you'll be my wife. Last night I dreamt I was walking on a beach, I felt somebody walking beside me, I turned my head and I saw an angel. He had been all white, and so bright that I fell on my knees and hid my head in the sand. I was blind and I cried with joy. But when I wanted to look at him again he was gone. And in his place... I saw a little man in a raincoat (???) with a thick book under his arm He stretched out his arm towards me, a very long arm, and he hit me... here. Do you believe our dreams have a meaning? Maybe. A meaning we cannot see. Where will you take me when we're married? I want to have a little house on the Crimea, next to the Black Sea, a little house with a large terrace. What are you thinking of? But I'm listening. No, you were far away. You're the only person on earth who cannot lie, please tell me what a man is thinking of when he says he thinks of nothing. I had been thinking of Aglaia. I will never ask you this question again. In fact, I have been listening carefully. But at the same time I have been thinking of Aglaia. It because of your dress, because she always wore white. Nastasia, I hope I haven't hurt you? Nastasia, tell me that you're not angry with me. Nastasia. She's here? Yes. Can I see her? Come. Where is she? She's asleep. You've killed her. Yes. At daybreak. That's what she came for. For her deliverance. And for mine. And also for yours. Killed. With the knife. How much it must have hurt you. She fell asleep immediately. Like a child. Why are men poor? Why is the child poor? Why are the chances null? Why don't all men kiss each other, why don't they sing songs of joy? Why are their faces so sad? Why doesn't one ask anything of the child? subtitles: serdar202
