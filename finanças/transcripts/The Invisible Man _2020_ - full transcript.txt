Adrian? Come on. Zeus, I'm sorry. I can't take you with me. I'm sorry. Shit. I'm not gonna leave you with that thing on. Okay. Come here. It's okay. Good boy. There you go. Come here. Fuck. Emily, where are you? Shit. Cecilia, what is going on? Are you okay? I'll explain later. Just go, Emily. Go. Open the fucking door, Cecilia! What is happening? Open the door! - No. - - Open this door! Open the door! - Open the fucking door! - I'm going, I'm going. Cecilia, get back here! Jesus! Get back here now! You can't do this! Get back here! Cee. How long have you been up? A few hours. Can't sleep. Now, you know, if you close your eyes and you lie down, that usually helps. Um, don't think being tired gets you out of our little deal, now. I swore to your sister I'd get you to step outside my house. Hey, Cee. He's not out there. I promise. I'm sorry. I'm just... - I'm not ready yet. - Hey, it's okay, Cee. That's the furthest you've gone since you've been here, okay? So, as far as I'm concerned, you just walked on the moon. I can't work with this goddamn thing. It's all right. I got it. I got it. Do I know you? - Do I owe you money? - A lot. A lot? I told y'all about running up on me in my house. Hey. Cee. Tell her she can't take you back. We're keeping you. What are you doing here, Emily? Well, it's nice to see you, too, sis. I'm gonna go see what Sydney's up to. - Just... - Mm. Yeah. This is not fair. I asked you not to come over. He knows where you live. He will follow you. Yes, well, I have some news. There is no news that justifies this. Okay, I have a plan, and I just... I-I need you to-to go along with it and just not be in control for one second. I'm not trying to control you, boo. I'm desperately trying to tell you that you don't need to cut me off anymore. Because he's dead. What? What? Hey. What did he do to you? Can you talk to me? It just doesn't make any sense. He was... he was in... he was... in complete control of everything, you know? Just... Including me. He controlled how I looked and... what I wore and what I ate. And... then it was controlling when I left the house and... ...what I said. And eventually... what I thought. And if... if he didn't like what he assumed I was thinking... ...h-he... he would... He'd what? He'd... He would... he would hit you? Amongst other things. He wanted to have a baby. And I knew that if we did that, that I... I would never be able to get away from him, so... I took birth control without him knowing it. But, um, that can only go on for so long, so... I called you. Hey. You're here with us now. And you're safe. He's gone. I'm not telling you to aim low. I'm just saying, e-explore more than one option, okay? Don't limit your choices to just one school in the whole country. But that one school is my goal. Parsons is my goal. Yeah, I told you to have goals... plural. I think it's important to have goals, James. Uh, hey. Look at you, getting out into the world. You know, by next year, you'll make it across the street. Uh, hey, Cee. - Hmm? - Something came for you. No one knows I'm here. So, who's it from? Thank you both for coming in. As the appointed attorney representing my late brother's discretionary trust, I'm required to enact his final wishes. And he stipulated that I do this in person. He wanted me to read a... a prepared statement. "Cecilia, "although our relationship was far from perfect, "I at least thought we had built up enough trust "that you would talk to me "rather than running away from what you - perceived us to have." - No, no. Sorry. You're not allowed to do that. - I'm required to read this. - She's not required to listen. E-mail me a copy, and we will read it. You bet. I'm just trying to do my job. Your job is to explain the money - you mentioned on the phone. - I mentioned Cecilia specifically is named in Adrian's trust. - That is why we're sitting here. - Yes. For the same reason so many women in Adrian's life got close to him: his money. If there was a chance of physically being close to him, we would not be here for any amount of money. You are physically close to him. He's in that urn over there. And as per his final wishes, you're getting $5 million, estate and income tax free. Now, the money will be staggered in installments of $100,000 each month for the next four years or so, contingent, of course, on the fine print. You can't commit a crime, et cetera. Normally, I would have a 120-day contestability period, but I'm gonna waive my rights in that regard. So... as soon as I have your signature and your banking information, I can start releasing the funds. Okay, you can come in now. - Uh-oh. - Oh, hey. Wait, wait. Where you at? - Okay. - Okay. - Can we look now? - Careful. Yes, you can look. - Ta-da! - Oh. Wow. Thanks, Cee. Wow, that's nice. L-Look at that. A ladder? Excuse you? I know I didn't hear you just say that. - I meant to say thank you. - What do you say? Uh-huh. You're welcome. Well, I-I knew you needed a new one, and that one just... that has to go. That's so nice of you, Cee. Thank you so much. That's very sweet of you. Thank you. I just... I wanted to thank you for, you know, letting me stay here and for taking such good care of me, so... And Sydney can also use ladders. Don't think I'm helping you paint. I wouldn't even bother to ask you. No, not for, like, painting, obviously, but just for a lot of things. You climb them to get things like-like stuff like that. That's so strange. God, I wish you had, like... Oh, wait, you could totally - use the ladder. - A ladder to climb up... Yeah, the ladder's cool. - Okay. - This happened to just pop up there by itself? - It happened to just be here, so... - Mm-hmm. - ...it's convenient. - Wow. What is it? - It has my name on it. - That's weird. - And it looks like your handwriting. - I don't know... - You sure it's weird? - I just got a ladder, so... - If you think it's weird. - I don't know what... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Let's see. A cool ladder is all. It's a new bank account, um, with your name on it, and I'm gonna put $10,000 in it every month for the rest of the year. I called the account "Parsons." You're going to fashion school, kid. Hey, whoa, Cee, Cee, that's... that's too much, Cee. Come on, are you sure you can do that? Let me put it this way. She can probably go to grad school, too. I'm going to Parsons. She can go to Parsons. You're going to Parsons. Oh, my God. Oh, wait, no. We got to cel... we got to celebrate. And I don't want TV dinners, microwave nothing, we... Oh, it's, like, I guess too bad we don't have anything at all to celebrate with. - Hey...! - Whoo-whoo! I don't know why you dancing. You can't have none, 'cause you're not 21. - Yes, I can. - Oh, come on. Just, like, a little bit. He said the other day that I was mature for my age. - That's right. - He did. - A mature child. - I heard you say that. - I remember. - Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up. This ain't fair, okay? Two against one. I'm just an innocent man trying to do right. Are you scared? Are you scared? This a... this is abuse. I'm a cop. - Are you-you scared? - You realize I'm a cop. - I got him, I got him. - Hey, hey, hey. - I got him, Sydney! I got him! - No, he's got me! Oh! I'll protect you! Morning. You want some breakfast? Nah, nah, I got to go. You know, I'm a little hungover, believe it or not. Ugh. Me, too. Champagne does that to me every time. We're getting old, Cee. We old. These winter mornings are killing me. All right, look, I'm out of here. Um, I'll be back around 7:00. - Okay. - All right? - Oh, uh, Cee. - Hmm? You mind getting Sydney up? She's actually pretty excited, thanks to you. She, uh... she might need a little help staying focused. You got it. Syd, come on, girl. You're gonna be late. Shit! Shit, shit. - Shit. - No, no, no, no, no. No, don't use water. No. Excuse me. Sorry. - Oh. - Wow. You did that. Yeah. You think we can salvage it? - No. - No? No. Sorry. James? James! James! James, James! Yeah, yeah, what? What-what happened? What happened? What? I saw something right there. They were right there. There were footprints. I saw it. You-you saw... you saw footprints? I saw... I... Yes, I saw... On the sheets. I saw it right there. - I saw them. - On the sheet? I saw it. There was someone in here. There was someone in here. Syd, put that stupid thing away. Y-You're the one who bought it for me. Who you gonna spray? Who? James, I saw it. I swear. Hey, Cee. Adrian will haunt you if you let him. Don't let him. Now, you should try and get some sleep. You have an important job interview tomorrow, and I don't want the memory of this motherfu... ...that... this person to ruin it. - Okay? - Okay, yeah. - Sorry. - Yeah. After Cal Poly, I worked in Paris for six months. That was the best time of my life, for sure. Except for this next phase, of course. Take a seat. So, any reason you worked in Paris in particular? Is that where all the beautiful women in the world have to go as a rule? Well, I speak a little... a little French, and I've always wanted to live there. So, after I graduated, I went out there on a totally student budget. I slept in a broom closet, literally. I started this firm in a supply closet, literally. There you go. - So we both know the value of closet space. - Yeah. Let me see some of your work. Yes, of course. Uh, um... I don't... Uh, I know that I... I know I put them in here, so I... so I apologize. I don't know what happened. - Um... - It's okay. Uh, you can send it to us whenever you get a chance. Okay. Uh, so, uh, l-let me tell you about us. Uh, at Ruler, we approach architecture on a human level. First and... Are you okay? Um, I'm sorry. Uh, I'm just not feeling, um... Uh, would you like some water or... Cecilia? Are you feeling okay? Cecilia. Okay, so, uh, you probably shouldn't drive or operate any heavy machinery for the next few days, but other than that, you seem fine. Either myself or my admitting will, uh, follow up with you with the results of the blood test. Okay? Uh, can you just leave a number with the nurse? You guys can go home. Okay. You ready? Yeah. Hello? Is Cecilia Kass there? That's me. Hi. Uh, this is Dr. Lee at St. Vincent's. So, we got the results of your blood test back, and it looks like the diazepam was the most likely cause of you fainting. Um, sorry, what diazepam? Well, your blood work showed a very high amount of it. That would definitely explain what happened to you. There's something else I wanted to talk to you about, but I'm not sure if we should do it over the phone, so, um... Tell him to stop. Tell who to stop what? Tell him to stop what he's doing. Do you know what she's babbling about? Nah, she hasn't explained to me why we're here yet, but being her very good friend, I know it's a good reason, so I'm gonna need you to sit up and listen. Show a little respect. One night, I was sitting, and I was thinking about how to leave Adrian. I was planning the whole thing in my mind. And he was staring at me, studying me. And without me saying a single word, he said that I could never leave him. That wherever I went, he would find me. That he would walk right up to me and I wouldn't be able to see him, but that he would leave me a sign so that I'd know he was there. The night I left him, I drugged him with that. I lost the bottle that night. And somehow, it found its way back to me. So, what exactly are you saying? You lost the bottle, you found the bottle. He's not dead, Tom. I have a pile of ashes in the box that would disagree with you, Cecilia. I don't know how he's done it. He's figured it out, though. He has figured out a way to be invisible. He is a world leader in the field of optics. I-I... I know that he could do this. Something tells me you know exactly what I'm talking about. He's not dead. I just can't see him. Please tell him to stop. Okay. No, I agree with you. Adrian was brilliant. But it wasn't because of anything he invented. It was how he got in people's heads. That was his true genius... knowing people's weaknesses. You think about it. He came up with the perfect way to torture you even in death. Only thing more brilliant than inventing something that makes you invisible is not inventing it but making you think he did. My brother controlled me long before he met you, Cecilia. I hated him. You and I, we got that in common. I was relieved... ...when I heard that he was dead. He's gone, Cecilia. I saw his body. Listen to me. Don't let him win by bringing him back to life. Hey. Hey. Emily, I need to talk to you. Well, at least now we have clarity. Now I know what you really think of me. - What? - Thanks so much for carving out the time to let me know how... quote, unquote... "suffocating" I am to you. What? What are you... Not that I should have to say this, but I never expected any of that money. Emily, I-I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. The e-mail... the e-mail you sent me this morning. - What e-mail? - If that's how you feel about me, don't ask me to bail you out of your personal life anymore. If you're too stupid to know who the good guys are and too weak to get away from the bad ones, don't sob to me for charity. I'm out. I didn't send you the fucking e-mail. I didn't. Someone is-is-is doing this to me. He's-he's doing this to me. Who's... Adrian? Adrian sent me the e-mail. Okay. You need some medication. Adrian is dead. Em, please, no. Cee? It's okay, Syd. You-you know what I think we need? Um... I think we could kick Dad out and... ...have a little girls' night. Eat some cake. Yeah. I do like cake. Oh, my God. Sydney, are you okay? Why would you just... Stop! Stop! Dad! - What? No. No, Sydney, I didn't... - Dad! Dad. - What? What-what... - No, I... - Dad, she... - What happened? What happened? - She-she hit me. - What? - No. No, no, no. James, I did not do that. Sydney, I would never hit you. I love you. I would never do that, James. It was him. He's here, I swear to you. Enough. Enough. Cee, enough. Just stop it. Are you okay, baby? - I don't want to stay here. - You-you all right? Sydney, I'm sorry. I would never... Hey, hey. Cee. Right now my priority is getting my baby somewhere safe. Do you understand? Come on, baby. It's okay. No. James, please. This is what he wants. This is what he used to do when we were together. He wants you to think that I did it. This is what he does. He tries to isolate me, - and he tries to get me alone. - Hey! You need to calm down. You are scaring my daughter. Now, if I were you, I would go to your sister's place. You don't need to be here right now. Come on, Sydney. Sydney, Sydney, I'm sorry. Sydney. Where are you? Come on! Where are you? Come on out. Don't hit a little girl. Hit me! So, why me, Adrian? You could have any woman you wanted. That's the sad reality. Right? And that's what money and power buy you. People. So... why me? I'm just a suburban girl who... stumbled into your life one night at a party. Can't you just forget I ever existed? There's nothing left for you to take. You've already taken it all. This is Adrian Griffin. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you when I can. No! - Cecilia? - Yes. Go. Please, hurry. Lock the doors. - Lock the doors! - You okay? Yes. Please, please just go. Okay. Just please hurry, please. Stinson Beach... that's a long way from here. I-I just need to get something. Do you mind waiting for me? I might be two minutes, I might be 20, I don't know, but... You could run me back to the city after. - Sure. - Okay. No problem. Zeus. Hi. Hi. 12-14... 17. The day we met. So romantic. Please, meet me tonight, if you can, in a pu... in a public place. 8:00 at Yulan. And if you can't, I understand, but you have to tell me, because I have to call someone else, because I don't think I have much time left. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Hey. Hey, guys. Welcome to Yulan. My name is Taylor, and I will be taking care of you this evening. Do you know how this place works? I'm assuming you order food, then you eat it. Hmm, pretty much. We just do things a little bit differently. It's all family style. We've been here before. It's all good. Okay. Can I get you started with some water? - We have still or sparkling. - Just the free kind. - Okay, tap it is. - Cool. Thank you for being here. I love you. You're like a cop, Emily, and y-you have this brute-force strength that is so, so comforting when I'm in trouble, and it is really intimidating when I'm not. I mean, James actually is a six-foot cop, and he's, I think, really intimidated by you. As he should be. I'd kick his ass. I would. You would. I need that strength in my life right now. And I need you to believe what I'm about to tell you. Okay. I... Thank you, Taylor. All right. Uh, do you guys need more time - with the drink menu? - Yes. Lots more time. Okay, no problem at all. Emily. I went to his house today. - You went to Adrian's house? - Yes. I just walked right in. I found something that can prove what I'm experiencing. That can prove that Adrian is stalking me. What is it? It's some kind of suit that Adrian has built. And it has cameras, and it somehow... What? No, please. No! You can't do this. You can't do this. He killed her. He killed her. Please, I didn't do it! I didn't do it. No! No! He killed her! He did it! You have to listen to me. - Please, please, no. - Try to relax. Please, no! No! Listen to me! No! You motherfucker! You killed her! I see you! I see you! He's here! He's here. He's right here. He's right here. Please! You can't see him. He's in the room. You have to listen to me. He's right there. He's gonna hurt me. - Please. No... - Okay. He's right there. - He's here. - Okay. He's right... There. - Everything's better now. - He's right there. Okay? You'll be all right. Surprise. Cecilia. Can you confirm the person in this video is you? And can you confirm you recently fainted during a job interview due to a high amount of diazepam in your system? - I was drugged. - Uh-huh. You also sent your sister an e-mail a few days ago saying you wished she was dead, didn't you? I have something. I have something that will prove he's alive. I found it. What do you have? I can't tell you right now. He's listening. He's in the room, James. You're saying that the person who killed your sister is in the room right now but we can't see him? Okay. - Yeah. - Thank you. James. Tell me you don't think I did this. Tell me you know that. I may as well have done it, though. I brought Adrian into her life. I did that. I shouldn't have walked out on you and left you alone. I failed you. Is this bed giving you any problems, Cecilia? No. Is there anything in the room that is distressing to you? No. Okay. Good. I wanted to talk to you about something. We checked the blood test that you had done at the hospital last week. Do you remember taking those blood tests? Yes. Okay. Well, did you know that you were pregnant? No. Didn't the doctor who took the test tell you? No, that can't be right. That's... that's not true. The test shows us that it was pretty recent. We can't be sure of exactly when, but it must have been sometime in the last month. Sweetie, is there anyone we can call? Family? Any friends? Okay. It's upsetting to see you in this condition. Even though things ended badly for you and Adrian, I still look at you as family. Are you my lawyer now? I'm the lawyer for your source of income. I represent my brother's trust. The money from his trust was payable to you conditional upon you being subject to criminal charges of any kind or being ruled to be mentally incompetent. Now, in light of your current situation, it's my duty to inform you that any further payments are to be halted. I know that you set up a bank account for a friend of yours to go to college, so I take no pleasure in relaying that. I used to feel sorry for you. The blood relative of a narcissist sociopath. Permanent punching bag. Handcuffed to his wallet. But now... I can see you for what you really are. You're just the jellyfish version of him. Everything but the spine. I mean, you can try to litigate it, but that's going to be an expensive option. I can't see it working. However... ...if you sign this document and forfeit your share of the trust, it'll be a lot cleaner. Or there's one option where this all goes away. Agree to have the baby... ...and go back to him. You really think he didn't know you were secretly using birth control? Of course he did. You should have known he'd find out. You knew him as well as I did. He replaced them with something else. You only thought you were taking birth control pills. He was always going to find you no matter what he had to do. He needs you because you don't need him. No one's ever left him before. But he's punished you enough now. Now that he knows you're the mother of his child. It's time to stop playing games. A new life with him can be given to you with one phone call. A life just like your old one with Adrian. Cecilia, you don't really have the choice right now. Right now you're a murderer. But I can change that. Adrian killed my sister, and you helped him. I don't expect you to make a decision right now. I can come back in three days. Be good to yourself until then. We'll be watching. Grab your umbrella. Grab your rain jacket. Grab your rain boots. You're gonna need it. You'll need them for a couple days. This pattern we're in stays put. We've got this atmospheric river pointed right here at central California. And that means we're gonna keep it cloudy and rainy as we get through the rest of the week. This is a lot of moisture coming in. It's going to mean heavy rainfall and flash flooding concerns right as we get to the end of the week. It's not until the weekend that we get our next chance of seeing some dry conditions. In fact, the next glimpse of sunshine even doesn't come until Sunday afternoon when temperatures hit the mid-60s. But until then, it's going to be cool, it's going to be damp, it's going to be... Open your mouth. Tongue up. Tongue down. Okay. Good night. You won't get the baby. And you won't get me. There you are. Fuck you! Get back in bed. Now. Hey! No! No! Please, no! No! Stop. Stop. No, please. No. No, stop! No, stop. He's right there. Lay down. He's right there. Lay down. He's right behind you. - Listen to me. - Who is? He's right behind you. - Turn around. - I understand, Cecilia. - He's right there. - Lay down. Listen to me! - He's right behind you. - Stay down. Bang. - Get back! - Hey! Hey, whoa. - Okay. Get back! She's over here! She's over there! Go right! You think you're learning how to beat me, so I'm gonna truly teach you something. If you fight me, I won't ever hurt you. I'll find someone you love and hurt them instead. Now you've only got yourself to blame for that innocent young girl's death. No, please. Not Sydney. Adrian, no. Hold it! Show me your hands! Hey! Cecilia, don't do anything stupid. I'm over here! Hey, stop her! Heading towards the main exit! What the... What the fuck? Hello? Hello? Hey! Harry, what's going on? Harry. Hey! Hello? Harry, are you okay? - He's fine. He's fine. - What? - I promise. - Who... who is this? This is James Lanier. James, it's me. Cee? What... How... - How are you calling? - It doesn't matter about that. - You have to listen to me. - No, no, it-it does matter. - Listen... - Come on! - You can't be calling me. - James, listen to me! - Look, I... Sydney's life is in danger. Where are you right now? I'm at work. She's at the house. Okay, you need to go to her right now, James. Do you hear me? 'Cause I'm afraid Adrian is gonna do something to her. Sydney. Sydney. Syd, you okay? Sydney, Syd... Stop! No! Stop! Stop. Dad! Dad! No! Sydney, get down! Don't cry. Tom? Is someone there? Help. Help. Please. - Help! - Stand clear! Police! Show me your hands. Our tactical team found Adrian this morning tied up in his basement. Looks like he was a victim of his brother just like you were. No. No, James. That's not right. Adrian did this to me. He is not the victim here. He was tied up in his basement. If he faked his own death, he could fake his own kidnapping. We have Tom's body laying in my living room, wearing some sort of suit that you shot to pieces. If it did work, it doesn't now. But-but we have a whole bunch of corroborative witnesses from the psychiatric hospital when it comes to seeing something strange. Look, this is your best-case scenario for getting your freedom back, okay? No. I mean... I know Tom's body is in your living room. Yeah. Adrian did everything before that, though. He set his own brother up. I know how this works, Cee. I know. You don't understand. No, you don't understand. This is what he does. He makes me feel like I'm the crazy one. This is... This is what he does. And he's doing it again. Okay, okay, but listen. I need you to keep that to yourself and let me do my job. Okay? Just let me help you. Yeah, but as long as Adrian's around, you can't help me. Cecilia? I'm so glad you called. Well... You look amazing. I mean, you-you've always... you always look amazing. I don't feel amazing. It's all a lie. Please, come on in. It's cold. Come on. So, I-I wanted to get us some simple takeout, but, of course, I-I started obsessing over what you'd be in the mood for. Hence, we have the OCD buffet of sushi, steak and pasta. Or you might not be hungry at all. Uh... which is so logical that it suddenly makes this feast look moronic. I'll have steak. That's a good choice. My hand's shaking. Uh... You know, you're the only person in the world who gets to see my hand shake. It's 'cause I need you, Cecilia. I know I didn't treat you the way you should have been treated when we were together. But I've learned my lesson. I would burn everything I own just to prove that to you. Okay. Okay. If you want to be a part of this child's life... ...it has to start with honesty. Of course. Which means I need you to admit everything that you did. That it was you, not your brother. You. Cecilia. I loved my brother. And I thought he loved me, too. I know it didn't seem like it to the outside world, but... Tom controlled me. Just tell me the truth. I need to know that I'm not crazy, okay? And we can't start this with a lie. But I'm not starting with a lie. It wasn't me. I swear it. Why can't you just tell me the truth? I am. Adrian, stop. I need you to do this for me. More than that, do it for you, Adrian. I'm giving you exactly what you're asking for, Cecilia. I am telling you the truth. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. I know that you feel like you're going insane sometimes. But I'm the only one who can help you. Remember? Because I know you better than anyone else in the world. I mean... that shouldn't come as a... surprise. I should go clean myself up. Of course. No! No, no. No, no. What did you do? 9-1-1, what is your emergency? Please, please, you have to help me, please. I'm with somebody, and I think he's... he's tried to kill himself. Hurry. You have to help. You have to hurry. Please. It's, uh, 3333 Celestial Drive. Please. Surprise. Hey, hey. - Hey. You okay? - It's okay. - You okay? What... - I'm okay. I'm okay. James, look at me. I'm okay. He killed himself. He cut his own throat. There's security camera video of it. You never did want to get him admitting anything on tape, did you? Of course I did. I just didn't know he was that unstable. You heard it, right? James? What'd it sound like to you? It sounded a lot like he killed himself.
