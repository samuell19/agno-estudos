No, no. If anything, it worked for me. You know, politicians in any country have a tendency to sound alike. The issues don't change, really. You're either for something or against it or both, depending on who you're talking to. But the point is when we hear a politician speak, we get the feeling we've heard it all before. The fact that I sound a little different, I think, helps to get people to listen to me. Man How many hours in this program? Not enough, I'm afraid. But are there any issues you'd like to amplify on today? Such as gun control, for instance, which you've been very occupied with on the floor of the State Assembly. Why are issues such as this so difficult? Well, they're difficult because we make them difficult. I think we have a tendency to complicate things. I mean, it seems to me that the laws of the land should be a matter of common sense. It doesn't seem to be very intelligent that there is no law against selling a gun or carrying a gun. Uh, I mean it doesn't matter what this group says or what that group says or what the statistics are, the fact is that guns cause deaths. My God, we have a law against selling firecrackers and yet anyone can buy a shotgun. We talk about nuclear disarmament-- let's start with firecrackers. Well, I told you I'd roll out the red carpet. We're really grateful. Yes, now all that's lacking is the guest of honor. I'm really sorry about that. He should be here any second. I hope so. He's drawn quite a crowd. If this turnout is any indication, you've hitched yourself up to the right coattails. I think many people consider you a bit of a buffoon. - Are you-- are you aware of that? - Yes, I am aware of that. I've done a lot of weeping. No, I think, uh... that people who criticize my sense of humor feel they're being attacked by it. Of course, their perception is right-- I am attacking them. They probably deserve it. But I think the ability to use humor as a disarming mechanism is something that has been, uh, used by some of the greatest statesmen in history. Hmm. Perhaps-- such as? Churchill was hilarious. Joan of Arc... very funny girl. Listen, tell me something-- did he really send a singing telegram to the governor protesting oil drilling in the channel? Sang it himself. Well, maybe that's what we need in politics, someone who knows it's all a joke. Don't let him fool you. That little singing telegram captured more media attention than five years of public outcry. Well, let's hope he has an easier time getting to Washington than he's having getting to my house. Hey. Hey, is this Meadowland Court? No. Do you know where it is? Who are you looking for? - Stillman. - Arnold? Uh, can you tell me where he lives? Yes. Can you tell me how to get there? - Are you a guest? - Yeah. - You're late. - Yeah, I know that. I am very late. I'm the guest of honor. How do you find your way around this place - without any street signs? - Follow me. Excuse me. Is it far? Nope. Can you perhaps give me directions? It's just up here. - Can I give you a lift? - No, thanks. Some men are attracted to girls my age. - I beg your pardon? - That's why I can't get in. Oh. Oh, I see. I see. - Are you? - What? Attracted to me? Uh, uh, no. Think I have potential? - As a what? - Attractive woman. You by any chance an undercover policeman? Just curious. Do you know Arnold Stillman? Very well. What sort of guy is he? - You don't know him? - No. Jerk. I think I do find you attractive. What's in the bag? A dead bird. - See? - Oh, God. What do you-- what do you do with it? - Collect it. - You collect dead birds? Bird parts. I just use the feet and beak. What for? I'm making a fetish. Oh... right. If you don't know him, how come you're the guest of honor? Oh, Arnold? Well, I'm running for Congress, and Arnold is giving me a little fundraiser. - You have an accent. - So do you. - Is that allowed? - Mm-hmm. Why don't you like him? - Are you a citizen? - I am. He always has famous people over there and he won't let me in. One time he had Rudolf Nureyev. I tried to sneak through the bushes and he had a security guard kick me out. It was humiliating. - What's your name? - Niki. You wanna come? I mean I'm not Rudolf Nureyev, but I can get you in. Uh, here. Don't-- don't come through the bushes. Use the front door. Say you're a guest of mine and bring whoever you like. - You mean it? - Yeah. I'm Patrick Dalton. If you have any trouble, just shout my name. That's if I ever get there, of course. Oh, it's at the end of the road. Even you couldn't miss it. Thank you. Bye! Yeah, he was a great tailor, my father. Um... he dreamed of coming to this country, California in particular, and he dreamed of houses like this, of course. He didn't want to own one, he just wanted to alter the clothes of the people who lived in them. For the record, I came here when I was 20, a very young person, and I was naturalized, which is very painful, when I was... ...25. And I've been in the State Assembly for six years, which is even more painful. And, frankly, I'm awfully tired of commuting. I fly from Sacramento to Los Angeles twice a week and I've learned how to curl up and go to sleep in the overhead luggage compartment. Not many politicians can do that. Um... so send me to Washington, please. Seriously, though, the reason I'm here is that I'm on the ballot for the January special election and I need all the help I can get in making myself known before that time. I won't spell out what kind of help I need, but I will be circulating with my tin cup right after dessert. Hopefully, we'll get a chance to talk. Thank you very much. - Slither through the bushes again, Nicole? - I was invited. Now, I made out the guest list myself, young lady. I have friends in high places, Arnold. I'm gonna have to speak to your mother about this, you know? - She's right over there. - She's here, your mother? In the flesh. - Oh, there you are. - Hi. Hi. Like my speech? - I loved it. - Good. - You know this child? - Know her? You kidding? Without this child, I might not even be here today. Oh, my, I had no idea. Hi. - Charlotte! - Hi. - Charlotte, I didn't know you were here. - Hello, Arnold. - I hope you don't mind our barging in. - Barging in? Why, I've been trying to get this woman over here for three years. Well, we're in town most of the time these days. Patrick, this is my mom. - Hello. - Hello. - You know Patrick Dalton? - I've certainly heard of him. - Yes? - Today I have. Niki can't stop talking about you. Well, the child has great taste. Threatened to drag me through the bushes if I didn't come meet you. Well, I appreciate you coming. Yes, I'm sure you do. Didn't you like his speech? Oh, yes. Didn't care for it? Well, let's just say I found it, uh, interesting. - Oh, well-- - You don't speak the way most politicians do. They usually discuss important issues. Or at least they think they do. Don't care too much for politicians? Uh, Charlotte, have you seen the buffet? No. Boy. Charlotte's interested in the arts, Patrick. She's quite a fine artist herself, they say. Oh, she is. She's fantastic. - Yeah? She's painting orchids now, but real erotic. She says petals look just like-- - Thank you, Niki. Well, I'd like to hear more about it sometime. Charlotte, have some caviar. Henry, bring some more caviar. Now, you didn't answer my question about politicians. You have something against them? We all have to make a living. So true, yeah. Um, listen, I can take it. Let's be honest. Niki, where's your shawl? - Oh. - Did you...? Yeah. I'm here, Mr. Dalton, because Niki believes you like her. - Well, I do. - She thinks that's why she was invited. - I didn't want her to know she was being used. - What? You see, that's what I have against politicians. I don't know what you're talking about. My daughter may be gullible, but I'm not. I'm the target of every contribution seeker this side of San Francisco. So if you expect me to believe that you go around handing out invitations to every little girl you meet, well, then, uh, I'm sure you'll agree that the Easter Bunny is alive and well and hopping around this party. You really don't know who I am? Well, I've eliminated Howard Hughes. Good, huh? Well, if you'll excuse me, we're due somewhere else. Yeah, I should be. God. Don't know who that is, my friend? I swear to God, I don't. Dreyfus Cosmetics-- chief officer and chairman of the board. Charlotte Dreyfus-- you've never heard of her? No. Well, uh, let's just put it this way-- if you were playing the slot machines looking for a prestigious party guest, that one's the jackpot. Patrick? - Patrick? - Oh, hi. I'm sorry, we've gotta go. Oh, well, I'm-- I'm glad you could come. - Thank you. - What do you believe in, politically? Can you give it to me quick? It's real important that I know. Oh, God, Niki, um... I don't know where to begin, really. Well, what about the poor? Well, I'd-- I'd like to help them. And what about wars and everything? Well, I'd like to stop them. Me, too. Right. Suppose I'll ever see you again? I don't see why not. Bye. Good-bye. Great. Mother not so great. Hi, Dad. Right. Hi. What happened? You're late. They've been here for 40 minutes. What happened? Hit the board doing a half gainer. Ow! Ow! God. When? I mean, is it broken? Just a hairline. The metatarsal. What does that mean? It means I'm off the swim team. Oh, God. Oh, I'm sorry. That's the breaks. Yeah, the metatarsal. Does it hurt? - Mom's more upset about it than I am. - Yeah? Yeah, she kinda freaked out in the emergency room. - What happened? - I don't know. I guess she thought I was gonna die or something. What about the election? Are you looking forward to national politics? Well, if we move to Washington, that means Pat can stop commuting between Sacramento and his district in Los Angeles. It means we could be a family again. You don't campaign with him now? Well, when I can. We think it's important that someone be at home with our son. But doesn't all the separation cause some problems? Well... Don't do it, Peg. Don't tell. She was gonna talk about the exotic dancer I was caught in a pay phone booth with. It's not true at all. However, this handsome gentleman and I have an announcement to make. I was trying to be serious. Come on, Peg, I'm sorry. What do you want to say? When I was about 16. - You, too? - Yeah. Just... just that it's not easy having you gone. And I think people think of us as weak, politicians' wives, because we're always willing to be left behind. In fact, I think it takes a very strong person to withstand it. You were upset about Jeff. I got a call from the school that he had hit the board and been taken to the hospital. I was really afraid it was serious. I tried calling you, but you were nowhere to be found. I just kinda fell apart. Oh, Peg. First I was upset about Jeff, then I kept calling you until late at night. Then I got worried about you. Hey. Come over here. There's nothing to worry about. Jeff's fine, I'm home, you know? - Where were you? - When? Last night. The fundraiser. So late? - Why, Peg Dalton. - Please don't be funny. Am I being silly? Hey, I'm an attractive guy, you know? No wonder you're insecure. - Gonna be home Friday? - Why? There's a party after the swim meet. Parents are invited. They're giving Jeff a medal. Kind of a Purple Heart thing. I think I've got a dinner in L.A., a roast or something. I'll try and get away early. I'll make it if I can, okay? He'd love it if you could. Then I shall. Oh. I do trust you, you know? Hmm? I said I trust you. - Thank you, Helen. - Helen? Who is this tonight? Peg! Oh, my God, how embarrassing. I-- my darling, I didn't mean to humiliate you like that. - Stop! - Oh! Bob, can you take this? Bob Crowther. Have you seen the results of the polling? Yeah, 70 % of the voters never even heard of Patrick Dalton. - Well? - Well, they don't know what they're missing. See, we need television time. No, I'm afraid he's a little pressed for time. We're trying to get him home tonight. Uh, no, 4:00 is no good. He has a public appearance. 3:00. That would be just fine. We'll have him there. - Okay. - What was that? My friend, you are beginning to look like a congressman. I don't know what she wants. All I can tell you is that needy politicians don't get phone calls like this every day. What's the problem? She hated my guts. She told me to my face. What the hell you care? I don't want to take favors from somebody who doesn't like me. Hey, this is not king of the high school prom you're running for here. She hates politicians. It doesn't make sense. Just go be polite. Just see what she has to say. Can I help you? No, I've, uh-- I've come to the wrong place. - Vocational workshop. - No, Dreyfus Cosmetics. - This obviously isn't the place. - This is Dreyfus House. Dreyfus House? Ah. Well, how do I find Charlotte Dreyfus? Oh, you came in the wrong door. - Ah. - You can get there from here. Just take the freight elevator to the third floor and cross over upstairs. - Freight elevator. - Third floor. Thank you. To your left. - To the-- - Left. Thank you. And turn. Side. Back. Good. And hold. Good. Now we're gonna do the adagio. Niki, would you demonstrate for us, please? Music. Lovely. Hold that. That's it. Very good. Ladies, preparation and... Mrs. Talamoni, pick up line three, please. Mrs. Talamoni, pick up line three. Excuse me, I'm looking for Charlotte Dreyfus. Yeah, she's right down there. Thank you. Woman Maintenance to lab three, please. - Right here. - Thank you. I'm grateful that you came. I was afraid you might not. Well, curiosity got the better of me. - I want to apologize. - Oh, please. Excuse me. Sit down. Yes, Cecile? Yes, that'll be fine. Right, and would you hold the calls? Thank you. Please, sit down. Thank you. Well... you've stolen my daughter's heart. Oh, and she mine. I just saw her. - Oh? - In her ballet class? I mean, she's-- she's a wonderful dancer. It's always been her ambition to be a dancer. - Really? - It's where she spends most of her time. Is that a school? Art classes and ballet and stuff? A program. We give classes to the children in the neighborhood and the children of the people who work here, people who might otherwise not be able to afford it. "We" being? My company. Oh, that's great. I see something that needs to be done that's worthwhile, I don't mind putting money into it. I would like to put some money, uh-- substantial... um, contribute-- uh, donation to you. I, uh-- I don't know how it's done. I don't even know how much you need, so I'd-- I'd leave that to you to tell me. Uh, if this is indelicate, you know, we could have our representatives meet and they could discuss things and then the money could change hands as soon as you want. No. Uh... May I ask what qualities you've discovered in me since our last meeting that you consider so worthwhile? I won't pretend. It's Niki. She very much believes in you. God, isn't this an extraordinary gesture to make on behalf of a child? She's an extraordinary child. She sent away for some material on you and, uh, feels you stand for all the right things. She wants to help get you elected. It's very important to her. You know, she's welcome to come to the campaign headquarters anytime she likes. Oh, well, you see the thing is she has set up her own campaign headquarters right here in this building. She's got telephones, a Xerox machine, posters. I think you'll be impressed when it's done. She's even trying to find a Teletype machine for background noise so it'll all sound very professional. She said she wanted it to be the kind of place that Walter Cronkite could just sit down in and start broadcasting. Hmm. Actually, I think you'll be very comfortable there spending some time with her so that she'd know that what she's doing is real. She wants to work full-time. Naturally, I'd like to keep her at home as much as possible. We live right here on the top floor. But she's willing to work day and night. What about school? I mean, forgive me. This is quite bizarre. Are you hiring me to play with your child? No, I didn't mean it to sound like that. That's really how it is. I had hoped you would see it differently. How? As a bargain. A bargain? To the extent that you're willing to support her efforts, I'll support yours. What if I support her totally? I'll do the same. I don't care what it costs, but I want her to have a legitimate function in your campaign. - You're perfectly serious? - Mm. I'll write you the check right now. You just tell me what to do. Well... at 5:00 today I'll have my representatives bring over three suitcases. Stuff them with thousand-dollar bills. No, make it hundreds. I'll have them bring 30 suitcases. Actually, no. Might be better in tens. But 300 suitcases? God, no. Ah, sure, what the hell? As long as we're dealing in fantasies here. Please don't go. Mrs. Dreyfus, you know I-- I welcome donations from people who know me and support what I do, but I won't be bought to babysit a precocious child. I-- I think what you propose is a lousy example of how life works to hold up to your daughter. I mean, if she wants to help, for God's sake, send her around to my campaign headquarters, let her distribute some leaflets. Let her know, by the way, I won't be accepting money for that. Thank you for your offer. Mr. Dalton? Mr. Dalton, please. I'm not used to begging for things. And I know I said it all wrong in there, - but I beg you to reconsider. - There's nothing to reconsider. She's got her heart set on it. She'll just have to learn that she can't have everything she wants. - But you don't understand. - I do understand. No! I can't let her down. I told you anytime she wants to come to the campaign head-- - No, it's not enough. She needs more. - She's just a child. But she wants to accomplish something. - Look, when she's older-- - She won't be getting any older. - Oh, my God, I promised her I wouldn't tell-- - What do you mean? - Please don't tell her that you know-- - Wait a minute. - No, I don't know you. - Wait a second. What do you mean? - Where are you going? - I can't talk like this. Very smoothly, thanks. Are you aware that the city polls put you behind this morning? Yes, I read the papers. Thank you. Well, do you think you can make up the difference between now and January? I think so, yeah. We're heading that way, I think, yeah. Is there anything special you'd like to say, Mr. Dalton, to our viewers and voters? Viewers and voters, I'm late and excuse me. - I'm sorry. - Oh, I am, too. I'm sorry. Well, thank you. Okay. Best of luck to you on your campaign. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks very much. We're talking to Mr. Patrick Dalton today... - Patrick. - Hi. - How did it go? - Fine. Where were you? I got tied up at the mayor's office. Listen, you got some time? I wanna talk. - No, I'm heading for the airport. - Come on, 10 minutes. No, I've got to make a stop. Listen, how did it go with Charlotte Dreyfus? Troubling. That's the stop I've got to make. I'll talk to you about it later. Hello. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, I was on my way to the airport. I'm looking for your mother. Oh. How did you get in? Oh, I just sort of sneaked in. I have my ways. Is she here? She's asleep. She isn't feeling well. Oh... okay. You're quite a dancer. Thank you. Mrs. Roich says I'm the best student she's ever had. - Yeah? - She thinks I'm ready to do Clara in "The Nutcracker." We're going to go to New York to see it over Christmas. - Ever seen it? - No. No, I haven't. But I know the music. My piano teacher used to drill me on it like your ballet teacher drills you. She said I was gonna be a great pianist. God, I used to believe it till one day I was having a lesson in her parlor, and there was this tremendous explosion outside on the street. You know, she didn't even flinch. She didn't hear it. You're really rather serious about your dancing, aren't you? Mm-hmm. Well, it takes a lot of years. Well, anything's possible. You know, I... I was gonna talk to your mother, but maybe-- maybe it's best if I talk to you. I heard you turned us down. Well, that's putting it a little harshly. It doesn't matter. I'm going to work for you anyway. Maybe I wouldn't have turned you down if I had known more about it. About what? Well, um... why this campaign is so important to you. What'd she say? It's-- well, she didn't say, you know? What she wouldn't say, I-- it left me with the feeling that maybe there was a lot more to know. - Niki-- - How long have you been married? Um, 19 years. Why? Do you cheat on your wife? - Cheat? - You know, with other women. - Have affairs. - Why do you ask that? Would you tell me if you did? No, certainly not. Why not? Well, it's, um... very personal. It's nothing to do with our relationship, and it's none of your business. Niki, are you sick? - She told you. - No, she didn't. She had no right. She wants to help you. I'm not a charity case! What is wrong with you, Niki? You know what it's about, "The Nutcracker"? A girl who has a dream on Christmas that she gets everything she ever wanted. My whole life has been like that. I don't have any complaints. All right. I did... cheat on my wife once. I thought I was in love with another woman. I was. I don't know how it happened. I just sort of, uh... caught it, you know, like you catch a cold or something like that. And, uh... it lasted a month. And it was probably the lowest period of my life. Now, I've never told that to anyone before. And I trust you won't ever tell another living soul. Okay? Okay. I have leukemia. It started when I was five. It came back twice. It's back again. I'm on my third relapse now. And that's all there is. I'm not taking the treatment this time because there's no point in dragging it out with what the treatment does to you. I've had some terrible fights with my mom about not taking the treatment, but even my doctor told her not to fight it. I'd just like to feel good until I can't anymore. Yeah. I made a fetish out of bird bones and seashells. - Remember? - Yeah. I think I told you about it when I first met you. Yeah. It's like they make in Haiti to cure people. I sleep with it. Can't hurt. No. But I'm mostly worried about my mom. I know she seems like a tough guy, but she's not. She's much more scared than I am. Are you saying, Niki, that, uh... you're going to die? Mm-hmm. How long are we talking about? Sometimes it hits little babies, and they're gone before they ever get a chance. I read that a mayfly only lives 24 hours. Did you know that? Yeah. A butterfly's lucky if it lives six weeks. How long? Well... I'd like to see you get elected. Pick that one up. "Dalton for Congress." Dalton for Congress. Are you a registered voter? Well, on January 26, Dalton-- um, Patrick Dalton is running for Congress, and, well, we'd like you to vote for him. Yes, uh-huh. Thank you for having me here today. Thank you very much. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Fine. How's it going? - Great. - Great. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You finished? - Yeah, in more ways than one. Can we take you to dinner? Oh, I'd love to. I've got to go to the airport. - I'm catching a plane. - Aw, that's too bad. I wanted to do something nice for you. - Well... - I'm a Dalton fan, too, you know. Stick around. Can we drop you at the airport? Oh, yeah. Well, thank you. That'd be nice. - All right. - You go ahead. - I'll take care of everything. - Okay. - Right over here. - Thank you. - Hi. - Dad. Hi. How are you? Whoa! Hi, Duke. Wait, wait, wait. Thank you, thank you, thank you. What did I do to deserve this? One sweet-talkin' man. Now, you've got that right. What's going on? Oh, come on. You don't know? What, did I win? Did they hold the election without me? Here you are, my friend. Have you seen this? - Champagne? - It's from the mother of your little friend. Or should I say the chairman of the board of Dreyfus Industries? They've organized a little cocktail party and art sale, the proceeds of which are going to a very dark horse in this congressional race. I especially like the part here where they say the last time they did this for the symphony, they raised $106,000. - Wow! - Wow! Now, I don't know anything about art, but I know what I like. Yes, I know what I like, too. Here. That's great! My God. Mrs. Dreyfus, would you pick up line two, please? Mrs. Dreyfus, pick up line two. Hi. I don't know what to say. I don't know why you did that. I'm a fan. I told you I wanted to do something for you. I mean, I appreciate it, but I don't feel right about accepting it. Yeah, well, you better accept, otherwise I'll invite your opponent. I feel right about accepting this. Very, very right. When will you be back? I owe you both a hamburger. Perhaps you could ask Niki to save Tuesday afternoon? She can do it, so can I, if you make it a cheeseburger. Agreed? Good-bye. Whoo-hoo! Oh! You rat! Oh, my God! Fine, yes. Well, okay. All right! - Come on, now. Now... Goofy. I'm sorry. You were in my... - Okay, wait. - Come on. - I've got to do it. Wait. - Concentrate. All right! Would you stay? On the couch, if you like. It would be nice to have you here. No. You never talk about them, your wife and son. I wonder what they're like. This seems very separate from them. You tell them about us? No. Do they love you very much? Yes. - And you them? - Yes. Yes, very much. That's... good. Charlotte... let-- let's not let this hurt anyone it doesn't have to. The devastation is gonna be bad enough. Patrick? Oh! - Morning. - Morning. Bob Crowther just called. He said if I see you, to tell you your wife is looking for you. Oh. What am I supposed to say? I've always considered myself a good person, but this is a hell of a test. Peg, I... I know it sounds ridiculous, but they really have no one else. And who do we have when you're gone? Does it take someone dying here to get your attention? Oh, God, listen to what I sound like. Why is she dying? What's wrong with her? What do you have to do with it? Why haven't I known? Why haven't you told me? I don't know. So maybe I'm not paranoid after all. Peg... if you met them, you'd understand. Are you in love with her? I just want to help them, Peggy. Do you love her? I'm not involved with her, Peg. Are you in love with her? No. No. Why don't I believe you? Is Jeff here? San Diego. Peggy... she doesn't have much time, you know? I talked to her doctor-- Am I supposed to just sit around waiting for her to die in a hurry, is that it? Just cross off the days? If I'm losing you, I can adjust to that... but not to the feeling that you'd rather be somewhere else. I told you I'm not involved with her, Peggy. I will not permit you to have two families no matter what their problems are! I know who Charlotte Dreyfus is. I know what she looks like. I know what kind of a powerful woman she is. So... just go. Until you're finished, don't bother coming home. Mrs. Navarro? Hi, I'm a representative of Patrick Dalton's campaign. Oh, come on. That's obsessive. Stop it! Blah! Do you think you two will ever make love? Niki! It's plain you love each other. I don't see why not. Mom hasn't had sex in ages. Oh, please! You're an outrageous child, Nicole. And if there were any chance at all of its happening, I'd say you just squelched it. I was just thinking that things seem perfect right now. Anyway, I'm going to bed. Good. - Good night. - Good night, brat. - Good night. - Night. By the way... tonight I'll be sleeping with my earphones on. I wouldn't hear an earthquake. - Oh, God. - Good night. Good night. She certainly knows how to get things on the table, doesn't she? Oh, yes. I spoke to my son today. He asked me how I felt about you. He said it was important that he know. I didn't know what to say. - Listen, just because-- - I probably am in love with you. I say that because it prevents me from following what Niki feels would be a natural course. I-- I have to sort out... other things. Do I have any say in this? Oh, I'm-- I didn't mean-- Because it's occurred to me, too... that I love you. I've never felt so warm. And you're right about making love. If I got that close to you tonight, I don't think I'd let you go. And I think it would be a good idea... if you left pretty soon. Shoot! Why, Arnold Stillman, how nice to see you. I hardly recognized you with all that hair. Hello, Niki. And this must be your daughter. Enjoy the party. Mr. Stillman. Thank you, sir. Why, Mr. Dalton, how nice to see you. Hey, Niki. How are you? Okay. I know you're not familiar with the house, so I'll point out that there's a freight elevator right down the hall which will take you directly up to the penthouse. Oh, how very kind of you. A frightful creature I've just met here. - See you later. - Bye. 50 years ago. - How wonderful. - Isn't it? - Can't wait to see the rest it. - How wonderful. It's great. - Excuse me. - Sure. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Great. - Hello, Bob. Look at this place. I can't believe it. I think I maybe overinvited. Everyone showed up. Well, good, good. Well, that's the point, that's the point. You look, um, fantastic. Thank you. I feel fantastic. - Well, that figures. - Charlotte! Hi. Are you looking for the Dalton party? Yes. I'm Nicole Dreyfus. I'm Peg Dalton, Patrick's wife. This is our son, Jeff. Hi. - Hi. - We're Mr. Dalton's family. There's a freight elevator. It'll take you upstairs. Excuse me, have you seen my mother? No, I haven't. I'm sorry, have you seen my mother? Thank you. I must hear you play it. - Hi, Niki. - Peg is here and Jeff. Uh, come and meet Charlotte... Dreyfus. Charlotte, this is my wife, Peg. - Hello. - And my son, Jeff. - Jeff. - This is Charlotte Dreyfus. And this is Niki. We met Niki outside. You have a lovely place here. Thank you. My father built it 50 years ago. The whole building. He loved it very much. So do Niki and I. She's very lovely. This is a nice surprise. Peg, come get some wine. How's she doing? Fine. Pretty good. She doesn't look sick, does she? Well, no. No, she doesn't. I hope this doesn't mess things up, our coming here. She didn't have a hotel room or anything. I didn't want her to come alone. She says she wants someone to know we existed. I told her I thought everybody knew. Don't think that I don't understand. Good to see you. - Call me next week, will you? - I'll give you a call... Okay, bye. - Hi. - Evening. Hello. I was looking for you. I was talking to Niki. Is she all right? She'll be fine. They, um... they just got on a plane and came down here-- no hotel reservations or anything. I'll be taking them back to Sacramento. I can't just let them, you know, walk off into the night. Oh, no, I wouldn't want you to. - No, I understand. - I'll be back in a couple of days. I think it would be a good idea if you stayed away for a while. What are you saying? I guess that I'm feeling, um... frightened. And I don't like it. And so is my daughter, and I don't like it. And my instincts tell me it's only gonna get worse from here. Well, I understand how you feel, but... You know, it's funny, I could avoid dealing with them until I saw their faces. The same is true for Niki. Said she feels she's doing something wrong. Oh, God, Niki doing something wrong? It's not your fault, you know. I pulled you into this. Oh, wait a moment. Let's get something straight. It's been my decision to be here, not yours, not Niki's. You haven't manipulated me into this. Please... I just... can't let myself rely on you. How does it happen that the people I love keep telling me to go away? Patrick Dalton stands on a record that speaks for itself. From the pollution of the Owens River Valley to the problems of the aged, to the puzzle of better education, he speaks to concerned citizens from all parts of our state and all walks of life. After 10 years as a California resident and six years in the State Assembly, Patrick Dalton is ready to bring his unique and outspoken voice to the legislators in Washington. Help him to help you, because Californians need Patrick Dalton for Congress. - Hello? - How are you? - Fine. How about you? - Uh, fine. I saw you on television. Well, you put me there. I've got a great eye for talent. Yeah. How's Niki? Good. Uh, I mean, is she feeling all right? Fine. - No change? - Mm. No, except she's looking better than ever. I think she's gonna fool us and outlive us all. I'll drink to that. Are we-- are we gonna see you? Well, I'm-- I'm waiting to-- I'm waiting for you to tell me when. After Christmas. Did you know we're going to New York? What, already? Well, we-- we moved it up a few days. When are you going? Friday, the night flight. But I'm-- is Niki okay? She's fine, really. She's great. We both are. Never better. Well, uh, when-- when will you be back? I'm not sure. I, uh-- I wouldn't mind going to Europe. They have some wonderful doctors there. And it's, uh... getting kind of gloomy in L.A. - Charlotte-- - How is it with Jeff and Peggy? Ah, it's fine. It's fine. I know we did the right thing. Don't you? Yeah. We'll call you from New York. I know Niki would want to talk to you. She's asleep right now. Yeah, I'd-- I'd love to talk to her. Tell her I-I miss her, will you? I'll be thinking about her. Tell her I'll dream of her at Christmas. I will. God... I-- I miss you both like hell. We think of you, too. I don't wanna hang up this damn phone. Give her my love. We'll talk to you. Hi. We're on flight 24 to New York. - Okay. - And we got two bags. Thank you very much. Thank you. Did you remember to bring the heavy coat? I put it in that suitcase, didn't I? Yeah, I did. That's right. ...Mr. Hinesburg, Mr. A.T. Hinesburg. White courtesy telephone, please. Okay? Anthony Williams, white courtesy telephone, please. Anthony Williams. Stop those women. Stop those women. Stop those women. - Oh, my God! - Patrick! Did you come here? - You're coming with us? - Let's go! Oh! Oh! I'm coming with you. To New York? How can you? What about the campaign? Just for the weekend. The campaign can live without me. - Two days? - Two glorious days. I'll take over. I think we're flying over the Brooklyn Bridge. Oh, we are. I've seen it in pictures. Look at all those cars. Isn't it something? A million stories down there in the big city. - Look, Mom. - I'm looking. You know who that is? My physical education teacher. Yeah. Do you see the people? - Yeah. I've never seen an opening night. - When is it? - Day after tomorrow. I've always wanted to come to New York and see this. You've always wanted to come to New York and be in it. It's a children's ballet. They come from all over the country to try out for it. - Why don't you? - It's too late. No, she thought about it for a while, but she decided she'd rather work on your campaign. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Are you sorry? - Only if you lose. - Oh... Ha! You just put me on the spot. Fun. What are you doing? I'm sorry. Come on. Come on. - No. - Yes, yes, yes. Niki. No! Don't! You can! Come on! Come on, Mom. Is it too late to go to Macy's? Niki, we've been going at it all day long. We do have to talk about dinner, don't we? - Yes, we do. We have to stay awake long enough to do dinner. Right. Can we go somewhere that has snails? - Snails? - What is that? - Stuff I've never done. - Let me see. Some of it's personal. - Like what? - Stuff. - What stuff? - Stuff I'd like to do. Well, if I don't know what it is, I can't help you. - Most of it you can't help me do. - Give me a try. Okay. I've never climbed a mountain or seen an X-rated movie. Oh. I've never touched a snake or been stranded on an island or ridden on a camel or had a bird sit on my finger. A cast on my arm or leg. Mm. A dog, a brother, a father, or a tattoo. Let's see. I've never had a boy say he loves me. And I've never had sex. I think I can manage the snails. Oh, and I've never-- I've never driven one of those. Oh, well, I think I can arrange that. - Yeah? - Yes. Your wish is granted. Perfect, she's dressed in white. Yeah. She already has her pajamas on. - Go on in. - No. You-- you go. What do you mean? It's not my idea, it's your idea. - So? - It's your mother. Yeah, well, you go do it. - You arranged it. - Go on. Oh. Hi. Mm. Hi. - What time is it? - What time is it, Niki? - Come on, we want to show you something. - No, I'm too tired. - It'll just take a minute. - What is it? It's a wedding. Tell her it's a wedding. Go on. Oh, well... It's a wedding. What are you talking about? Your child wants a father. You and I are getting married. Oh, puh-lease. Well, not very sentimental, is she? - Come on. - No, go away. - I told you she wouldn't. - She's just playing hard to get. - Come on. - Stop it. See what we do here-- - Don't you dare! - Well, cooperate, then. Come on. It'll only take a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - It won't hurt. - What the...? Don't say a word. - You all set? - What are you...? - Just go. - I don't believe this. - Oh! - Oh! Oh, my... Where did you get all this? Please be seated. Please be seated. Thank you. Oh, you brought Harold. What's he doing here? - He's a priest. - A priest? He's the right man for the job. Well, what'd you want, a rabbi? Room service, two rabbis. This isn't a joke, Mom. Oh, all right. I'm sorry. - She's right, it's not. - Okay. So, uh, what do we do? Well, what do we do now? I don't know. I'll do it. Do you want me to? - Okay. - Fine. Is that all right? Yeah. Whatever you guys say is fine with me. Yeah, I know. It's always a "yes, ma'am." - Champagne, too? - Ah! Wonderful! Listen to that glorious sound. You do this awfully well. Have you practiced? - No. - It's almost like the sea, isn't it? Okay, that's-- that-that-that-that... - Oh, come on. - ...that's enough. Oh. - Okay. - Okay. - Raise your glasses. - Good idea. Sounds right. And repeat after me-- "We pledge eternal love." We pledge eternal love. Look at each other. Say it again. "We pledge eternal love." We pledge eternal love. "And agree to be married..." And agree to be married. "...for now..." For now. "Because there is no always." Because there is no always. "And we will remember this pledge." And we will remember this pledge. "Until we no longer remember." Until we no longer remember. I now pronounce us man, child, and wife. You may now kiss the child. Wake up! Everybody out of bed! Rise and shine! No dawdling! Come on, we're late. We've got to be there in one hour. On your toes, please. Hint, hint. What's going on? Hey, you better start getting warmed up. Start doing some exercises. Get the picture? What-- what are you talking about? Where have you been? Damn near got myself arrested. For what? Demanding to see the head of the ballet. - Things becoming clearer here? - No. Let's give this a try. I said, "I am a candidate for Congress, and I am not leaving until I see the man who hires young dancers." What are you talking about? I'm talking about your daughter. I talked him into seeing her dance. She's auditioning for the ballet. - In an hour? - In an hour, yes. We have to get dressed. I have to get dressed. Honest to God? I have no more clues. I frankly expected this to end with, "Don't call us, we'll call you," but, uh, she's quite something. Now, I just don't know what to do with her. Well, couldn't you just stick her in the background for a couple of nights? - Ready, and-- - Ann? - She's wonderful. - Mm-hmm. I think we should use her. Any ideas? No. You know, if she could just be in for opening night somehow. She's a quick study. No, no, opening night's out of the question. Uh, I could teach her "Snow." I have time today. And this wouldn't be a problem because the girls are the same size. Leave her with us and come back for the run-through. Ann's got an idea, but it's going to take the cooperation of a rather temperamental 14-year-old. We're gonna work the hell out of her. Is that all right? Oh, yeah. She'll probably work the hell out of you. Really? Oh, really? Oh, thank you! Okay... Nice and relaxed. Oh, and look straight ahead. - Dress rehearsal in 10 minutes, please. - It starts to tear up. - It does? Yeah. And stretch right here 'cause it makes the skin harder. Stay there. Yeah. Oh, that's much better. Five minutes, everybody. Now we're gonna go right through, so if anybody needs to go to the bathroom, go now. - Are you all fine? - Yeah. Okay. Good luck. Okay, girls, line up, single file. Shh, quiet down. Okay, get ready. Okay, we're ready now. Here, line up. Niki. Go on! Come on, take a bow. Bravo! Bravo! - You can't believe what it felt like. - I bet. Imagine what it'll be like tomorrow night - with the place filled. - Mm. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. It was so much fun. I mean, it was just-- oh. - Can we go celebrate? - What've you got in mind? I think we should go home and go to bed. - Oh, can we take the subway? - The subway? Yeah. It's on my list. Please? All right, okay, but only if you agree that we're going home and to bed. - Okay. - Only if you pay. And, um... here's the art collection up here. This is Leonardo da Vinci, one of his greatest works. This is what is known as a good time. - Ooh, you're so vicious. - Hey, watch it. This is-- this is just a little antisocial. This is-- this is what you have to do in here to keep this thing going. Yes. I'm gonna get you. Watch it. You'll fall. Don't wanna play, huh? What is it? What is it? - What's wrong? - Niki, what is it? Niki, are you all right? What's wrong? Oh, my God. We gotta get off this train. Sit down. Sit down, Niki. Is there a way to stop the train? No, it's an express. Sit down. Oh, sweetheart. We've gotta get off the train. They must-- they have a cord that you can call-- - We've got to stop the train. - I know. There's a way to stop it. You pull something-- - There's no point. - God, it hurts! It stops in the middle of the track! But we don't know how long it is to the next station. But that's the shortest time. There's no point in stopping the train in the middle. But we have to stop the train. We don't know how long it's gonna take to get to the next station. - Oh, darling. - Mom! Mom. Oh, baby. What is it, Niki? What is it? Hurts. It hurts. No! No! Oh, God! Niki? Oh, baby. Open! Open it! "I hope I have died suddenly because it was my wish. And I hope no one is going to carry on in a way that will make me feel helpless, wherever I am, to make me feel better. I had a good life, most especially the end part. Better than practically anyone, I'm sure. Whatever those things were that I did not have were not worth having, 'cause what I had was wonderful. I want my body burned... and thrown away where no one is even tempted to go and sit near that pile of nothing and feel sad. If someone is sad remembering me, then they didn't know me or they've forgotten. All my belongings and my inheritance I want given to the poor... except for my ballet shoes, which I wish will be worn once by a famous ballerina. I have big feet... so this might be possible. That's it for now. That's it for now except for unending love. Niki. P.S. In case you wonder if I have a last wish... I bet you both can guess what it is." I'm going away after, um... we do whatever it is... that we have to. There's a place in France. I used to go there with my father. Before Niki... was born. I think it's a good idea... if we let some time pass. Until things seem more clear. I wouldn't mind it if you said something now. I love you. I love you, too. Transworld Airlines flight number 34 for Paris is now boarding at gate 15. - Thank you. - This is your final call. - That's $4.51. - All passengers should be aboard. Thanks very much. Listen, I, um... Patrick's voice:
