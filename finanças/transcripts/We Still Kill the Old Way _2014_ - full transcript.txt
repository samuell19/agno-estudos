[YELLING INDISTINCTLY] AARON: Yeah, mate, fucking trash this place! [INDISTINCT YELLING] This is nasty, man. [CLATTERING] [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] -[BIRDS CHIRPING] -[SWING MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] What the fuck are you doing? MAZ:Yo, Aaron! Aaron, this way! JP, Maz, grab her, bruv. [WOMAN YELPS] [BABY CRYING] What the fuck has it got to do with you, huh? -I don't want any-- -Shut up! -[BABY CRYING CONTINUES] -You're fucking ugly, man. You're lucky 'cause I would've bent you over this railing and give you another bastard mouth to feed, you get me? Did you see anything here? No, no, no, you didn't see nothing then, huh? Right, then we'll see about that then, shall we, yeah? [SCREAMING] No! No! Would you clock my face if you see me again? -Answer my fucking question! -[BABY CRYING] [WOMAN SOBS] I didn't see anyone! [BABY CRYING CONTINUES] Are you going already? Can't we have a little cuddle or something? Cuddle? Fuck that. I've got shit to do. Oh, really? What about us? Are you dumb? There is no us! You're a sket. That's it. And put some fucking makeup on, man. You look like a dog. I'm sorry, is this some sort of joke? What about all the time you spent with me? Oh, my days, you don't get it, do you? Just trying to get you into bed, Lauren, which was a waste of time. You're a fucking shit fuck anyway. What are you doing? -[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] -Evidence, innit? What do you mean? All my boys think you're frigid. You ain't now. Get out! Hello. Is Charlie there? Really? Oh, good. Well, if he comes in, tell him Richie called will you? No, I'm-- I'll call back in a couple of hours anyway, okay? Okay, good. Bye. Oi, she got well dirty towards the end. Yeah, man. Oh yeah, let me stick it in her bum and everything. I'm telling you, bruv, I'm telling you. Yeah. Okay. Nice. Oi, bruv, you should see this place. What are you doing? Listen, I gotta go. I'll catch you later. I said get out. Who's this? This your sister? It's my mum. Man, she's fit! Maybe you should invite her to the party next time. -Can you just fucking leave? -Now, be nice. Or I'll be nasty. [DOOR OPENING] -Shit Aaron, you took your time. -Yeah, well, I ain't like you. I don't see a pair of tits and come instantly. What do you mean, man? I don't do that, bruv. Come on. As ever, exactly when you said you'd arrive. As ever I always stand by my word, and, as ever, you're not ready. -Always keep a man waiting, that's what I was taught. -[RICHIE SCOFFS] [MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY ON RADIO] DEAN: So did you just talk? Fuck you wanna know what me and the bitch did for? Just, she... Ah, you wanna fuck her, innit? Waste of time, bruv. No, no. Look, I like her-- No, no, it's all right. We'll sort something out. If you're with Lauren now, bro, that's cool. I ain't fucking with her, man, she's just a bit on the side, you get me? It'd be fucking funny to see you bang, still. I tell you what, I'll text her now, innit. [MESSAGE TONE CHIMES] [SIGHS] -WOMAN:I'm home! -[DOOR CLOSING] Hi, Mum! RICHIE: He's my brother, Carmen. He's not f-- He's not royalty. You asked me to arrange a party for his birthday, and this is how we do things. -Only the best in España. -[CHUCKLES] Well thanks, Carmen. It sounds amazing. It also sounds expensive. Very, very expensive. I know how important Charlie is to you, so it has to be amazing. -Yeah. -Plus if it wasn't amazing, then I wouldn't be able to charge as much money, would I? Oi! Who fancies a bang tonight? [CHEERING AND HOWLING] -Is this about Lauren? -Slag needs teaching. So, you really don't want her? Sharing is caring, cuz. Why? You scared of man seeing your little dick? MAN: Hey, give me one of those, man. [LAUGHTER] You should give him a call, make sure he's sober enough to get on the plane. Carmen, he's not a complete drunk. He wasn't even in our local when I called. [SCOFFS] I'll tell you what. I'll call the Dover Castle, and if he's not there, I'll buy you dinner. Oh, well, since I'm your client, I rather thought you was buying me dinner anyway. -CHARLIE: He's one of the best safe breakers in the business. -[PHONE RINGING] I mean, he was the bounce, you know, top dog. GILES: Hello, Dover Castle, how can I help? [CHARLIE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] GILES: He's here, but he's just started the trouser anecdote. -Hold on. Mr. Archer? -[CHARLIE CONTINUES] -Mr. Archer? -...round her fuckin' ankles... -Mr. Archer? -Fuck. Come on. Okay, hang on a bit. I'll tell you in a bit. [CHUCKLES] -Yeah, hello? -Mr. Archer, please hold for your brother. -Charlie! -Hey, Richie! Darling, how are you? It's terrific to hear from you! Hey, what are you doing? You getting someone to dial the number for you? What, your little fingers gone to sleep? Is it too much activity on the right hand? [LAUGHS] So you was just passing by the pub, were you? Everything's changed now, there's no longer a pub, it's a fucking upmarket fucking bistro. You're lucky if you get a fucking drink. Couple waiters say, "This is the specialty of the house, it's a pigeon breast fritters with beetroot chutney..." Goose liver. Oh, you know how they do that? They shove a pipe down a-- Its fucking throat and shove a lot of food-- force a lot of food down it, you know, like they do when they force feed you in prison, and then eventually its poor liver explodes. And that's what they call haute cuisine! I'm really missing you, Charlie. I'm looking forward to seeing you. Yeah, me too, bruv. Oh, good. Well, go home, get your head down. You're not as young as you used to be. Richie, you bastard, neither are you. -And don't miss your plane! -Over my dead body. Bye. [SIGHS] Ah, that was terrific. LIZZY: Oh, here we go. Here comes trouble. That was my brother. He wants me to go home. LIZZY: Oh, he's telling you what to do. Well, my, how times have changed, eh? Oh, yeah, yeah, they have, princess, and let me tell you this, not always for the better. So, um, how is he, your... your brother? Yeah, he's all right. You know, he's still wearing little miniskirts. -[LIZZY LAUGHING] -No, I'm joking. He's good. He's terrific. Lovely geez'. Do you know, I haven't seen him for... what is it? -I think it's, uh, 30 years. -CHARLIE: Oh. And back in the day, I used to have a proper thing for him, -when he was younger. -Oi! Oh, come on, Charlie. I'll tell you, you're too old for me, darling. [MIMICS LAUGHTER] Oh, come on, you're still gorgeous, -you still got it. -Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you what, I'll give you his number. [LAUGHS] You know, I think, um... I think I'd be too scared to call him. Too scared? Okay, that's fine. Well, uh... come home with me then. Hmm. Darling, it's been so long, I wouldn't even know what to do with it. Well, I'll give you a couple of lessons. [CHUCKLING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] AARON: You all right? You're looking nice! No, wait, wait. Come with me. I wanna show you something. Come. I got a little surprise for you. What's going on? I thought I'd introduce you to my boys. Properly. Therefore we're gonna be seeing you later, sweetheart. Okay, I gotta be off home like a good boy. All right, all the best. Goodbye, princess. -Bye, love. -CHARLIE: Bye, love. Yeah, you too. Behave yourself. Keep off the little boys, will ya? All right, ta-ta, love. -[LAUREN SCREAMING] -[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Wait till you're invited, eh? Come on, Dean, time to bust your first nut, bruv. I'm not too sure. What do you mean you're not too sure? Pull her skirt down and fuck that bitch! [LAUREN SCREAMING] Oi! All you! What the fuck do you think you're doing? Duck out, granddad. This's got shit to do with you. -JP: Fuck! This bitch bit me! -CHARLIE: Hey. -JP: Oh, fuck! -CHARLIE: Hey! Hey! Hey! I really... I really... -wouldn't do that again. -THUG: Fuck off, old man. [GANG MEMBER LAUGHING] I'm telling you all now. The next ponce who tells me to fuck off, -I'll take your fucking jaw off. -[LAUGHTER] [WHISPERS] Fuck off. [BONE CRACKING] Hope you liked that, did you? Eh? You enjoy it? It'll be a bit of a tickle. You fucked up. -No, you fucked up. -I don't think so. You don't think so. Okay, come on. Come on, you and me. Don't work like that anymore, old man. Oh, you steaming heap of dogshit! You're too fucking cowardly to do a one-to-one, you ponce! -[LEROY KISSING TEETH] -I hate that sound. -Sound like a rat pissing. -MAZ: Shut up! [CHARLIE GROANING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [CHARLIE GRUNTING] You fuckin' hold this for me, man. You wanted one-on-one, yeah? [CHARLIE LAUGHS] About time... you-- you got your-- your hands... -dirty. -AARON: Shut the fuck up! [LAUGHTER, INDISTINCT SHOUTING] Yeah! Fucking want some, huh? You fucking cunt! Cunt! Yeah? Fucking what's up now, you cunt? Huh? Huh? What are you fucking saying, bruv? What are you fucking sayin', yeah? Yeah? What the fuck, yeah? Dickhead! [SPITS] -[FLEA SMOOCHES] -Go on, you little fucker. You how me some respect, do you hear? Oh, take your fucking hood off! -FLEA: Shut up, you slag! -Oh, grow up! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [GASPS] Oh, my-- Oh... [PANTING] And how did you know the deceased? Well, same way everyone in the neighborhood know-- knew him. And how's that? Well, how did everyone know him? You don't know Charlie or Richie Archer? Oh, you're one of those coppers, are you? Work part-time then? No, I'm-- Well, no. I'm a detective constable. Oh, well, I'd drop the "detective" if I was you, and the "able." You know the Kray Twins? The Richardsons? The Krays, yeah, of course I do. I saw a movie about them where the brothers weren't even twins. He was just like them. This was Charlie and Richie's manor, right? Okay, I get it. So they run the place, took a slice of it. -Literally, in some cases. -I really wouldn't mock, D.I. Taylor, because at least then we could walk down the street and we wouldn't be harassed, or even worse. These days we do our best. Oh, right, of course, the budget cuts. Yeah, yeah, I know all about that, but I can't even remember the last time I saw a copper walking the beat at night for God knows how long. -Mrs. Davies-- -Ms. Davies, actually, which, if you had read my statement, which is right in front of you, you'd have seen that, wouldn't you, Detective Constable? You were saying Charlie Archer was murdered, and it seemed you're about to suggest something. Did you see the murderer? No, I didn't see the murder, but I know it's the E2 gang. The E2 gang? What makes you say that? It was bloody obvious, wasn't it? I mean, they was all coming out of the alleyway as I was going in and, well, you know, I recognized most of them. They're... Oh, they're just like cockroaches, that lot. They're just scurrying around. They're just-- -They need to be destroyed. -Ms. Davies, it would be best if you didn't say that. Well, why? They-- I mean, they're trying to destroy us, aren't they? Our community, our way of life, and-- What? You want to protect them, do you? We need evidence before we can do anything. Oh, I see. Of course, evidence. God, did you find any evidence at Charlie's murder scene? Did you find any, uh, ooh, fingerprints or CCTV? Or... oh, any leads whatsoever at all? Did you see anyone causing Charlie Archer any harm? -Did you see anyone murder him? -No, I didn't see anyone murder him, but I just know it was the E2 gang, you know? I just-- Oh, you lot! Back in the day, this sort of thing would never even have been allowed to-- Well, we don't live back in the day, Ms. Davies. But I will follow up in your assumption that the E2 gang are involved in some way, -and question them. -Oh, I feel so confident now. Well, can I go home? Of course. Thank you for your time. Oh, no, no. Thank you. I really hope you stick to your word... because a very, very good man died tonight. Interview with Ms. Lizzy Davies ends at 2:37 a.m. [SIGHS] Technically not a good guy as he committed arson, theft, and murder. -[SIRENS WAILING] -[DIALTONE RINGING OUT] -[PHONE RINGING] -Yes, hello? Uh, Mr. Archer? This had better not be one of them bloody sales calls. No. [CLEARS THROAT] No, this is, um... this is Lizzy Davies. Uh, well, you won't remember me but-- Lizzy Davies. [CHUCKLES] Uh... 237 Torrance Street. Long brown hair. Lovely blue eyes. Slim, well, a bit on the skinny side, actually. Well, um, you remember me. -Yeah, I remember everybody. -Oh. RICHIE:Hello? Mr. Archer... Call me Richie. How did you get my number? Well, you see, I've got bad-- Well, no, it's not bad. It's terrible news actually. Yeah, I've not heard from you in 30 years, and when I do it's, "I've got terrible news." I don't like the sound of that. -Hello, Lizzy, are you there? -Yeah. RICHE:You know, I get the feeling you're a bit upset or a bit scared, or both. Yeah, well, don't be scared. I've... I've not been that person you remember for... many, many years. Trust me. I'm a man of my word. Do you know we all know that about you? It's-- well, it's one of the things I really liked about you, actually. All right, so, Lizzy Davies, why are you calling me in the middle of the night after all these years? [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] WATTS: You sure about this, Guv? TAYLOR: Ms. Davies said she saw the E2 gang in the vicinity. That's some of the E2 gang. -And as for him... -What about him? [SCOFFS] You'll find out. Look, I know we're following a line of inquiry, it's just that... these kids ain't murderers. They're all mouth and no bollocks. You got a better idea? House to house might throw up something. Yeah, right. What was he doing down that alley? -It's not on his route home. -He was an old boy. Maybe he stopped off to have a piss and someone jumped him. But why? He still had his wallet on him. Have they traced his brother yet? Spanish police are on it. [SIGHS] That's a meeting I'm not looking forward to. Come on, let's rattle some cages. Well, well. You're a Fed. Have we met before? You come looking for me? We just wanna have a little word, if that's okay. What if it's not? I see what you mean about this MILF thing, y'know. We can just as easily do this down the nick, but I know how you like to keep your name off the record. Hey, bruv, make sure you catch this on camera, yeah? You know what these dickhead feds are like for fucking up innocent people. This is bait, what the fuck d'you want? I know why you don't have a record. Hey, listen. I ain't a snitch no more. Fuck that. I'm done with that shit. Well, just so we're clear, I don't approve of what happened with my predecessor. About his big promotion? You're jealous, yeah? Yeah, getting promoted for overlooking your crimes isn't what I call good policing. Well, you lot banged up some pretty big fish, so the way that I see it, everyone's happy, you get me? Apart from your victims. Hey, that's all behind me now. I was gassed up back then. Don't fucking look at me like that, man. Ain't a day goes by I don't regret working for you pricks. Talk to me like that again and I'll knock you into next week, and I don't give a fuck who's filming. Where were you at around 10:00 p.m. last night? -I can't remember where. -Try harder. I was with my boys watching a film. Really? What movie? -I dunno. Just some film, innit? -Where? DK's yard. Someone fitting your description was seen in the streets near the Dover Castle pub. Like I said, I was with my boys all night, innit? Yeah? We were hoping you were gonna say that, because a witness gave a good description -of some of your mates too. -Well, that's bullshit man. An old man was attacked. It's a rough area. He died, Aaron, so whoever did it is going down for murder. Which means whoever did it won't get a second chance, -no opportunity to turn grass. -Again. Are we done? -Well look, if I hear anything-- -Like a good citizen. -I'll be seeing you, Aaron. -Can't wait, darling. Little prick. We should just search them all now. I'd bet we'd find some weed. [SIGHS] It's not worth the paperwork. Let's walk the crime scene one last time. What's happened? The old man is dead. -THUG 1: What? -THUG 2: Shit. Good. Serves him right, innit? She said someone see us. Oh, man. She's fishing. Unless the old woman grassed. Nah, she won't say nothing. She knows better. We didn't see no one else there. But there was someone else there. All right, come. We duck out, bruv. Come on, let's go. [CHOPPER WHIRRING] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] RICHIE: Hello, Roy. Good to see you again. Good to see you too, mate. I'm sorry. RICHIE: What a shit hole. He didn't deserve this. Do you mind? I still live around here. [CHUCKLES] Sorry, this is closed. [RICHIE SIGHS] It's open now, innit? Leave him. And next time, have more conviction about what you say. I didn't believe you. [WATTS TALKING INDISTINCTLY] So if we assume-- Excuse me, sir. This is a crime scene. Outta my way, son. Wanna talk to the organ grinder. Eh? -This where it happened then? -Mr. Archer? Oh, good! At least you got some detective skills. -I looked up your mug shots. -Ah, as I say, it's good to know that you're doing something to find out who killed my brother. Detective Inspector Taylor. -This is my investigation. -Oh. I'm very sorry about your brother. Thank you. -So what could you tell me? -Not a lot. We still don't know why he ended up in the alley, -let alone who-- -Who killed him? Well, it's early in the investigation. Well, nice to have met you, Inspector. -Mr. Archer? -Yeah? I know your reputation, and I know that we will have inevitably certain divisions between us. But let me be very clear. If you interfere in my investigation in any way, I will have you picked up and put inside. That old saying, "I wouldn't wanna meet him down a dark alley," I see what the fuss is about now. [STONE CLANGING] -Lauren, are you okay? -Am I okay? Fuck you, Dean. -You were going to rape me? -No, I wasn't. I didn't know Aaron was gonna do that. I didn't realize you and Aaron-- It was a mistake. He's coming here right now. He thinks you're gonna tell the police. -Well, maybe I should. -If you do that, he'll kill you. Like that old man. Please, Lauren, I don't want you to get hurt. [CAR APPROACHING, MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, fuck! He's coming! AARON:Lauren? -[DOOR THUDDING] -AARON:Lauren! I know you're in there. Don't be fucking ignoring me now. My boys are a bit disappointed that you left so early the other night. Yeah, I was telling them how good you are at being a dirty little... -[DOOR BANGING] -...sket! AARON: Now, listen to me, yeah? And you fucking listen to me good. My boys, they're my family, yeah? And they're like my fucking hungry pack of wolves, you fucking get me? And you? You're just a dirty little pig sket. So if you don't keep your dirty little mouth shut... [TUTTING] Guess what. I'll huff, and I'll puff... and I'll burn this fucking house down, while you and your bitch mama sleeping! -[HOWLS] -[DOORBELL RINGING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, God. [DOORBELL RINGING] Hello, Lizzy. Now, this E2 gang, we are nothing to them. They've got no respect for us, because nobody stands up to them. I mean, the bloody coppers, they're clueless or they're shit scared. RICHIE: Yeah, I've got that impression too. I mean, it was different when... -RICHIE: What? In my day? -Well, yes, you know, at least you could walk down the street. I tell you, if I my old man was-- I just wish I could do something to help, you know? Poor old Charlie, you know? Oh... -He was a nice fella, despite... -Despite being a villain? Well, yeah. [BOTH GIGGLES] Listen, um, it might be an idea not to let the police know that I've been here. Okay. Might complicate things a bit. Who'd have thought you'd be in my house? [CHUCKLES] I just wish you was 40 years younger, that's all. -Yeah, well, so do I. -[SCOFFS] It's not what I meant to say. What I meant to say was, uh... I would feel a lot safer if you was back. We all would. DEAN: I'm so sorry for not stopping what happened. It's not like you could have stopped all of them. You say that, but... an old man did. -AARON:Get up! -Listen to him, bruv! -[INDISTINCT SHOUTING] -AARON:Fucking shut up! My nephew, um, found it this morning. It was on a dark site. It's... Well, it doesn't show up in your normal search engine. I have no idea what she just said. It's not like I'm an expert or anything. I just sort of muddle through. Does your nephew know any of these kids? I have no idea, but I recognize them. I'd swear by it. Do you want me to print out a screen grab? What? You zoom in on the faces and then you can print it out. Well, we could give it to the police too. No. No, we keep this to ourselves, right? When somebody crosses me, I prefer to deal with it myself. Now, if you could just get me those screen doodahs, those faces, if you could do that for me. Here, look at this. I looked at some of the other videos this user posted, and I found this. Oh, my God, that poor girl. This is the same place where Charlie was killed. You know, I think I know her. Pretty sure I know where she works too. LAUREN: Hiya. Can I help? I hope so. I need some information. -LAUREN: About what? -The alley off Tenth Street. -LAUREN: I-- I don't understand. -Oh, I think you do. LAUREN: I'm sorry, but... I think you've got the wrong person. [RICHIE SIGHS] Now don't play games with me, sweetheart. Is everything all right, Lauren? Yeah, thank you, yes. We're fine, aren't we, Lauren? Who are you? -You're not a policeman. -No. [SCOFFS] No. But I do want some answers. The man who died protecting you was my brother. -Lauren? -Yeah? Yeah, I'm okay. Look, I can't talk here. I'm so sorry about your brother. -There was nothing I could do. -I know. Look, I don't care why you haven't said anything to anybody about all this. I just want some names, that's all. Now, did you know any of them? -Oh, you did? Give me the names. -I didn't know any of them. -I was just attacked. -No. I wish I believed you. If anyone of them found out that I-- Their names. I was with Aaron, -who I thought was my boyfriend. -Aaron? Well, Aaron who? Aaron what? What's his surname? I don't know. [SCOFFS] You don't know your own boyfriend's surname? -What's happened to this place? -I was just trying to fit in. -I thought he really liked me. -Well, how involved was he? He's the ringleader. Nothing happens without him saying so. All right. -Anybody else you recognize? -Yeah. I think his name's Maz. He went to my school. -But you're not gonna-- -Not a word to anyone. Please be careful. There's so many of them. Yeah, I've always believed in quality not quantity. Now you should get back to work. -Mister? -Yeah? He was a good man, your brother. -He saved me. -Yes, he did. And you know what he'd say if he was here? He'd say, "Lauren, stop wasting your time hanging about with a bunch of vicious little arseholes, pardon my French." Life's too short, sweetheart. It really is. [TRAIN CLACKING] [CHURCH BELL RINGING] Looks like we might have some help. Now, I appreciate the gesture, but I don't want anybody else getting involved, 'cause this is gonna end up bloody. What? What? He doesn't want our help! Only you, Arthur Bennett, only you would dare make a fucking joke during my brother's funeral. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Well, you know me, Richie. I'm either having a laugh or I'm fucking furious. And we thought you've found a happy balance in your old age. [YELLS] Less of the fucking "old"! Relax, fellas. I'm just joking. Nice to you see again, Arthur, and you, Butch. How's things, eh? Been a bit boring since you left town last century. I got a feeling things might be changing. So, uh... what's the score, Richie? Well, from what I've seen on the video, there's about six of them. And they're nasty little piglets. And I would really, really like to hear them squealing for their mums before the end. That sounds like fun. I'll dig my blades out. Where can we find these little bast-- Butch, it's not as simple as that. This lot are part of a firm, and there could be loads of 'em. Yeah, and they got youth on their side. So we gotta box clever, haven't we? Now, today is for Charlie. But tomorrow we are going to war. Also for Charlie. The fuck you doing, bruv? That ain't for me. Yo, Kel! Sell it. Don't smoke it. Fuck off then. DK: Aaron, someone's asking questions about you. -What? That bitch fed? -Nah, some old guy. I don't think he's fed. Maz just seen him talking to Lauren about a dead guy. Sounds like some dickheads need to be taught how to keep their mouth shut. -[SWING MUSIC PLAYS] -Thank you. -Madame. -Oh, thank you, darling. Not many gents left in the world now. I know. Sometimes I think I'm fighting a losing battle. What? They were good old days, though, weren't they? This lot here know nothing about romance. Full of piss and wind, the lot of them! -Give us a pint, Butch. -BUTCH: There you go. -Liver? -Well spotted. Well, I've cut enough of them out in my time. I should know. Sorry. Private party. -I'm looking for-- -RICHIE: Detective Inspector! -Sorry to interrupt. -But you did anyway. We don't have any contact details for you, so we knew you'd be here, obviously. Obviously. Can we have a word in private? Well, come over here. So how's your investigation going? We're still doing house to house, but it's a closed shop around here. Oh, some things don't change then. Mr. Archer, I do want to find the person responsible. -Good. So do I. -That's my job, not yours. -But I do understand your loss. -I wonder if you do. Well, I do. You just have to take my word for it. What do you know about loss? I'm a widow who's trying to balance being a mother with a full time, pretty stressful job, and it would really, really make my life a lot tougher if you were thinking of going on some vigilante rampage. I'm not a vigilante. I respect your family matters, and I am sorry for your loss, but I'm sure you understand why I want you back in Spain -as soon as possible. -I am not a vigilante. Is this a good idea? I mean, here? What's wrong with it? Charlie loved it around here when we was little. And when he was older, if you know what I mean. Well, let's just say, he ain't the first person we've dumped in the water here. Isn't this where we lodged that shooter after we killed-- -what's his name? -MacVey. Wish I could dig the fucker up so I could shoot him again. [LAUGHS] Good to see you, gents. Here's to the good times. And the bad ones. If only old Mother Thames could talk, eh? It's not the Thames, Arthur. It's a fucking canal. Anyway it's the perfect place. Be seeing you, bruv. [SIGHS] Right. Let's go to work. [SIGHS] JACK: Oh. Hello, Jack. Long time no see. Hello, Richie. Heard about Charlie. Bad business. Yeah, I don't like what you've done with the place, Jack. Fucking kids nowadays. No respect. They can't just nick stuff. They have to fucking destroy everything as well. That's why I'm here. I need your help. [SCOFFS] Forget it, mate. -Those days are long gone. -Hey, I thought so too, Jack but yet here we are again, eh? [CHUCKLES] So what do the police say about all of this, eh? Did they give you your crime victim number? Do me a favor. Oh, bugger me. You never even called them, did you? Well, that shows a lot of confidence -in your old firm, I must say. -It ain't that. Oh, or you can't bear the thought of them seeing how pathetic they end up when the force spits them out the other side, eh? [SCOFFS] You're in good shape. Kept well. I've got a tan, Jack, and I'm 20 pounds overweight. That's what the Mediterranean does for you. Should've gone myself when I had the chance. You stayed for her, it was the right thing to do. All that money I made on the side, all those deals we done, all went on her care, you know? And for what? Same result as if I've done nothing. Well, we all gotta die sometime. Yeah, it's always too soon for those of us left behind. -Do you see much of them? -[SCOFFS] Much as I can. They give me hope that the next generation won't all be fucking animals. God, Jack! You really are such a big old misery guts, aren't you? Dear, oh, dear. [LAUGHS] Well, I'm gonna cheer you up. I need some inside information from your friends in blue. What do you need? Well, restrict the manpower on the case for a start. I don't have to ask for that, Richie. It's probably been done already. Also, I could use some records on a couple of toe rags called Aaron and Maz. Even if I agreed, who says they'll listen to me anyway? Oh, I'm sure a former Detective Chief Super does have some clout, even with the Met. So what do you want me to say? "Here, lads, fancy doing me a favor?" I don't care what you say, Jack. It's not my problem what you say, just so long as you say it. May I remind you I put a lot of money in your back pocket over the years. And I kept you out of the nick, Richie. You and most of your lads. We all benefited. Yeah, but there was a bit more to it than that, wasn't there? Remember Billy Morgan? Pat Corrigan? Terry whatever the fuck his name was? -Richards. -Richards! Yes! See? You do remember, don't you? They're all still dead. -And who took over their turf? -That's not the point, is it? I think "Metropolitan Police ordered gangland killings." That's the real headline, innit? I know where all the bodies are buried. I'll show you if you like. To be honest, I'd have thought your lot'd welcome some help. -How'd you make that out? -Well, let's face it. These arse wipes are walking all over you, all over the East End. I mean to say... it's embarrassing. See what you can do. I'll let myself out. Think they can scare me, they are just little shits! All right, they're not men. They're not people. -They are not part of society. -RICHIE: What happened? Did they hurt you? Richie, you have just got to sort this mess out. Did they touch you? -Did they physically hurt you in any way? -What? You're not listening to me. I've had enough, all right? And if you're gonna go after these bastards, then I wanna help you, right? We all wanna help you. Just sort this fucking shit out! [MESSAGE TONE CHIMES] -[DOOR CLOSES] -WOMAN:I'm home! -Hi, baby. How was your day? -Same as always. Are you sure everything's okay, love? You seem a bit distracted lately. You haven't been out. You're not feeling sick, are you? It's not a lad. No, Mum. I'm not ill. It's not a lad. Just tired. That's all. Come on, I know you better than that. If something's bothering you, you know you can tell me. No secrets. We've always said that. No secrets. Honest, I'm fine, Mum. Really. Okay. I'm a copper, remember? So I always know when something's not right. -Not quite the Med, is it? -No, not quite. But it's got its charm. That's why it's worth fighting for. Speaking of fighting, I persuaded an old colleague in the evidence room to make this disappear. RICHIE: Charlie's? -JACK: Thought you might want it. -RICHIE: Hmm. Ah. Still got your thing then? It-- it's not a thing, Jack. It's a medical condition. Everything I could get is in there. Aaron obviously kept his nose clean 'cause there's nothing on him. But there is an address for Maz. He's your typical gobshite. Arrested for the manslaughter of an old-age pensioner. World War II veteran, no less. But the prosecution screwed up the case, and he walked. He ought to pay for that. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] RICHIE: Hello, lads. [CHUCKLES] Oh, dear. You two are in a bit of a pickle, aren't you? Now... you can either make this easy, or we can make it hard. What's it gonna be? -This must be a joke, man. -[BUTCH SHARPENS KNIFE] -What's with theReservoir Dogs look? -[BUTCH SHARPENS KNIFE] That supposed to scare me? That's fucked up! Understand? Nah, it's fancy dress. They've come as a boy band. Fucking untie me now, yeah? And I promise I'll let you live. That's very considerate of you. Now where can I find Aaron? -Fuck you! -MAZ: Untie us! Maybe we should tell the young gentlemen why we're here. Yeah. Now this is how it is, lads. My brother was kicked to death recently, and at least one of you is involved. -ARTHUR: Maybe both. -Maybe both. And now one of you, or both... [KNIFE SCRAPING] ...is gonna have to pay. But not until I know who Aaron is and where I can find him. Listen, you have no idea what's coming for you when we get out of here. Fucking untie us, yeah? We're E2. You know what that means? It means you're fucking dead. Well, being fucking dead doesn't worry me too much, son, 'cause I've been nearly fucking dead many, many times, and so have my friends. We don't give a shit about you or your faggot friends! Well, you should. You should give a shit about who we are. What? Four old twats? Oh, yeah, yeah. We know how you like killing old men. -Pensioners. -Oh, that old fucker. He wouldn't give us his medal, so he got what he deserved. Think that's pain? That's not even gonna come close to the pain I'm gonna put on you. Pain? You wanna talk about pain? Oh, well, look at him. Now he used to be a torturer, and he's good at it. He was one of the best, actually, and he's got this uncanny knack of knowing -when people are lying to him. -Oh, I'm terrified. Unfortunately Leroy here is telling the truth, but he'll learn soon enough. Now, see him? He's what you call an enforcer. And trust me, you only cross him once, and if you're clever, you never cross him at all. Fuck the history lesson. Cut me loose, and I'll let you live. ROY: He's lying. -He wants to kill us. -ARTHUR: Yeah. And then there's old Butch there. You wanna know why they call him Butch? LEROY: 'Cause his face looks like an old dog's ass? [LAUGHING] RICHIE: Yeah, well, that is one reason. -BUTCH: Bollocks! -No. It's because it's short for "the butcher." He can carve up a body in 15 minutes, can't you, Butch? I reckon 12 with him. There's fuck, all of 'em. What, am I supposed to think you are some sort of hard man now? You ain't got no respect for E2? When I get out of here-- Why don't you shut the fuck up! I'm looking at my friend's body language, and he doesn't look very pleased. -Hmm? -ARTHUR: They just don't get it. Arthur... you wanna give these up. They'll kill you. [MAZ SCREAMS] -Now, do I have your attention? -Yeah. Were you there when our mate got done? No. I don't have to even rely on my ability to spot a liar! [MAZ PANTING] We've seen the fucking video... and you're in it. Why is it this generation keeps putting themselves on the internet, -doing stupid fucking things? -It's that, um... go on, uh, reality shows. Right? Everyone wants to be famous. You wanna be famous, eh? Live fast, die young... of a fucked up corpse! Courtesy of me! Technically it'll be me that fucks up his corpse. Well, it looks like he can't talk now... so it's your turn. Where can we find Aaron? Oi. Where the fuck is Maz? He's not answering. Any bets he's just with some sket. Yeah, try him again. JP, call Leroy. Something ain't right. What? You think it's feds? No, no, no. We would've heard by now. [PHONES RINGING] DK: Wait, look, we got enough enemies. Any one of them could take from us. Ah, you dumb. No one's gonna try it with us, man. Yeah, but what about them Eastern Europeans? They're fucking everywhere, and they could take over real quick. Yo, blood, call me back as soon as, yeah? They're fucking crazy too, you know? Look, if they got Leroy and Maz, you think them'd lead them to us? Hey, look. Listen, if someone is trying something, yeah, then we need to find them and then we need to fuck them up. -JP: Mm-hmm. -Now, go get everyone on it. And, JP, get everyone tight and off the corners so we can sort this shit. -Oh, blood, not the corners. -Oi, oi, bruv, remember who you fucking work for, yeah? If I tell you don't be shotting, you don't be fucking shotting! -Look, all I'm saying, bruv, yeah-- -Saying what? Saying what? Huh, I don't give a fuck what you got to say, bruv. What, you telling me how to run my thing? Look, I just wanna shift some weed. No! I don't want no one else going missing. Now go find my boys. What about that old geezer we saw Lauren talking to? [AARON LAUGHING] What you fucking chatting, man? Ain't no old prick gonna do nothing. He's nearly dead. LEROY: I ain't telling you shit. ROY: Good. That's just how I like it. What are you gonna do? His voice is getting on my tits. Now... Now, you listen to the nice man, all right? ROY: Now, we're all upset, because you and your mates killed his brother. And he wants to know who else was involved. -[METAL CLANKING] -And you're gonna tell us... one way or another. -[ROY GROANS] -[MAZ SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] That's for that war veteran you murdered. [MAZ CRYING] And this... [MAZ SCREAMING] And that one's for Charlie. [MAZ SCREAMING AND PANTING] Fuck. And I'm gonna keep nailing this piece of shit to that chair until you tell us what we want to know. [MAZ PANTING AND GROANING] [METAL TOOLS CLANKING] You ever seen one of these? Fucking antique, innit? [LAUGHS] Yeah. Used to take an age an' all. -Ooh! [SIGHS] -[SQUEAKING] You've no idea how hard human bone can be. [MAZ PANTS] This was how we used to do it. The old way. Now, this... -This is the new way. -[DRILL WHIRRING] No, no! Please! Please! No, please! -[SCREAMING] -[CRUNCHING] And Dean? -Where the fuck is Dean? -I'm on it. [PHONE RINGING] -LAUREN: Thank you. -DEAN: Cheers, mate. -[PHONE RINGING] -I should answer. JP? -Who are you with? -No one. What do you mean? Have you seen Leroy and Maz in the last few hours? No. Get on the fucking street, man! What you doing, man? Get out there. Ask questions, man. Make yourself fucking useful, Dean. You gotta go? I ain't gotta, but they want me to. So, are you gonna go... or are you gonna finish that milkshake? I wanna stay here. I mean, it's a wicked milkshake. [LAUGHING] I'm sorry, son, but you have to be awake, otherwise this is all a complete waste of time. Now, all the bad things that you've done in your horrible little lives, all led up to this point. It's called retribution. Karma. Payback. But I'm quite willing to stop all this. I'm quite willing to forgive and forget, if you'll just tell me where I can find Aaron. Look, look I was there, okay, but I didn't do anything. I didn't touch the guy. -Your bruv, I mean. -Where does Aaron live? I don't know! I swear down. I've never been there. He's lying. I can smell it. -[DRILL WHIRRING] -No! [SCREAMS] [MAZ PANTING] He always knows when someone's lying. It's a gift. Fuck! Fuck! Okay. Tell me where you want me to bring Aaron, -and I'll bring him to you. -That's an even bigger lie. Drop your mates in it? You fucking Judas. You want me to start cutting now? -No, let him go. -What? For fuck's sake! I said let him go. He's just a kid. This is a mistake, Richie. This little shit will grass us up. I swear. Tell me where you want me to bring Aaron, and I'll bring him to you, then I'll vanish. Untie him. Now, if you ever breathe a word about this to anyone, or I even get a sniff of you around here ever again, you're history, my son, you understand that? I swear, I won't say nothing to anyone. Go on. [SIGHS] -I told you he was lying. -And I believed you, Roy. But I've never killed someone who's sitting down, let alone tied up. -I mean, it's not fair. -[LAUGHTER] How's our veteran killer, eh? -Nah. -Oh, dear. What a shame. Well, I think we might call it a day then, eh? [DRILL WHIRRING] What, no one saw nothing? People fucking lying, bro. Lying to me! Everyone's looking. -This JP seems to be connected. -Yeah, in more ways than one. He shares friend links with, what, most the names we've been talking about, except Aaron, he doesn't seem to come up anywhere. -Where did you get this stuff? -Oh, just social media sites. It's not very difficult if you know where to look. You're something of an expert with all this computer thing, eh? -Nah, just a nosy cow. -[LAUGHS] Especially with the neighborhood being like it is. Yeah, well, we might be able to do something about that. You know, you already have. I mean, the mood around here, it's just, um... well, it's lifted since you've been back. There's nothing like a good funeral. [GIGGLES] That's not entirely what I meant, but... So, uh, what are you up to then? Ah, just getting the lay of the land, you know? This is gonna be very useful. Well, I better be going. Oh, yeah. Um. Well, if you need any help-- I mean, obviously I'll keep looking and-- Yeah, of course. Thanks, Lizzy. You wouldn't fancy going out one of these nights, would you? -We could get something to eat. -Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. No, no. I mean, yes. I mean... -that'd be nice. -Great! Well, leave it with me, eh? And wear something red. I remember that dress you used to wear. Stunning. [GIGGLES] Yes! No, I'm sorry, but I think there's a red one over there. Okay, great. RICHIE: Hello, Lauren. [SIGHS] Why are you here again? I'm not stopping till I find the person responsible. I'm a man of my word. Now, I was just wondering if you knew any of these people. I can't. They threatened me. I-- I'm sorry. I just can't help you anymore. Lauren, uh, let me tell you a little secret about threats and blackmail. And I have a thorough knowledge of the subject, believe you me. The sooner you find the exit, the sooner you find the solution, the sooner your life goes back to normal. They've got pictures of me, and I'm so ashamed. It's not even who I am. The whole thing could ruin me. That's what they're relying on, your fear. It's not gonna stop, you know, they're gonna keep turning those thumbscrews. I used to do this for a living, so I know what I'm talking about. I help you, you help me. I've got a daughter, but she's all I got, and if someone ever... Allow me to remove these people from your life. Good girl. Thank you, Lauren. Friends? Friends. Great, well, now we're friends. first things first. I expect you'd like me to stop scaring you at work, don't you? Maybe you'd like me to phone you from now on? Yeah. Um, what's your number? I haven't got one. What do you mean? -You ain't got a mobile phone? -No. Old school? Less of the old. You write your number on there, all right? See, they got pictures of you, but I got pictures of them. Here. Take a look. Was he there that night? He had nothing to do with it, I swear. -He was. -Good. Do you know where he lives? No, but I heard he serves up deals at the Grave's End Car Park. What the hell are you doing here? Mum! Mum? Uh. [SCOFFS] I was just looking for a dress, a red dress for my friend Lizzy, but I couldn't find anything suitable. Stay away from my daughter. [SCOFFS] I honestly didn't know she was your daughter. Thank you very much for your advice, miss. -You okay? -I'm fine, Mum. It was nothing. Give me your wallet now, you old fuck! Who you calling an old fuck? ROY: We need him alive! BUTCH: I was aiming for the back wheel! -[TIRES SCREECHING] -[♪♪♪♪♪] You know what? I'm really enjoying this. ROY: Me too. -[JP GROANS] -[ARTHUR LAUGHING] There goes our no claims bonus. [LAUGHING] Oops. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, my fucking back! I'm too old for this lark. What the fuck's going on? You're fucking dead! You hear me? Dead! Well, I'm alive and well. Here. Do you remember that? JP: Let me go, you bastards! -Look at it! -That ain't me. -Where can I find Aaron? -Never heard of him. [GRUNTS] -Now I'm gonna ask you again. -Fuck you! [GRUNTING CONTINUES] RICHIE: You see how this is going, don't you? You want me to rat someone out? No. I'm asking you how I can find the person responsible for killing my fucking brother! Listen, I don't care how powerful you think you are, granddad. You ain't as powerful as the E2. I grass up Aaron... I might as well be dead. Sounds like I gotta work through my tea break. This is a fucking joke! You ain't gonna do anything. That's what your friends said last night. Yeah. Guess what they're saying tonight. Nothing! That's the trouble with your generation. You think you're invincible. You think nobody can touch you. You think you're gonna live forever. But not you. Jesus, look at you. This ain't some Houdini trick. You ain't getting out of this one. Just fucking kill me old man, -'cause when I get out of here-- -When? [LAUGHS] You've gotta admire his optimism, haven't you? I'm gonna fucking kill all of you! Under-fucking-stand me, blood? That's funny. That's exactly what Maz and Leroy said. Just before we killed them. Fuck you, man! When E2 finds out about this, you're all fucked, you understand me? Your wives, girlfriends, whatever... they're all gonna get fucked! Fucked in every hole! Fucked up the arsehole especially! You got any daughters? Got a daughter, yeah? By the time E2 are finished with her, yeah, she won't be able to fucking move! Let alone walk properly, blood. Yeah, one by one. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! And she's gonna fucking love it! You know what irony is? This belonged to my brother. [RICHIE GRUNTS] You know what? Why don't you get on your fucking knees like he did, and start begging just like he did! [JP GROANS] [CHUCKLES] And we was laughing. Laughing at your pussy old brother. Just cut him up, little fucking fat cunt. [JP GROANS] How's that for fucking irony? Jesus, this used to be easier. [BREATHING HEAVILY] -ARTHUR: What now? -Now... [BREATHING HEAVILY] Well, now comes to main event. -Oh, fuck! -ROY: Richie! Are you okay? [HEART BEATING SLOWLY] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Back in a moment. No excitement, okay? How can they say "no excitement" with you walking around, eh? -And they say chivalry is dead. -[ARTHUR LAUGHING] How you feeling? Vulnerable. I'll be glad when they got me on the ward. My feelings exactly. This place is wide open. You're worrying about nothing. Even if they did know you were here, they wouldn't have the bollocks to come. Maybe. I just don't fancy spending a week trying to sleep with one eye open, that's all. That's all right. We'll look after it. No. No, I've got unfinished business with that little scrote. And if anybody's gonna fuck him up the arse with a Christmas tree, it's gonna be me. Give me a phone, somebody. I'm gonna call a friend. Thanks, mate. My life savings, brothers. Smell that! [LAUGHING] -[GUN COCKING] -[AARON GROANS] Bruv, we should've got one of these time ago! Ain't no one fucking with us now. Huh! [LAUGHING] Dickhead. All right, grab a gun, bro. Grab a gun. -Grab a gun! -DK: Go on, walk then. She wants to see you. What the fuck do you want? I've got some information about that old bloke, the one that's been hunting you all down. -What about him? -He's in the hospital. Heard my mum talking about it earlier. -Heart attack or something. -Bullshit. It's the truth, I swear. What the fuck you telling me for? 'Cause I thought... You thought about me and you, yeah? Yeah, I thought, you know... Yeah, really? Get your fucking sket hands off me, man. What's this bitch gassing for? Call the fucking hospital up now and find out where he is. -But I can't. -Just fucking do it! Hi. I'm trying to find out about a man called Richie Archer? Yeah. He's my uncle. He's on Rankin Ward? That's lovely. Thank you. See? I told you. Right, DK, gather some boys. I think it's about time we pay this old fuck a little visit. Grab this bitch, man. She's coming with us. MAN: Can you tell me what's going on? I've been here three hours now. RECEPTIONIST: It's the weekend, sir. We're always really busy. But even so, you told me half an hour ago. RECEPTIONIST: What's your name, please? [PHONE RINGING] What the fuck you think you're doing? It's my mum. If I don't answer... Just let me text her at least. You stick with me, yeah? Put that on. Fucking put it on! [♪♪♪♪♪] [ELEVATOR BELL RINGING] -AARON: DK. -Yeah? Wanna step up? Now's your chance. What, you want me to do it? You heard me. Are you a leader or a sheep? Now both of you, go. [♪♪♪♪♪] Hello. Oh. You should at least have brought some flowers. You've seen one of these before? Trust me, it'll fucking hurt if I pull the trigger. Are there any more like you outside? How many? Answer the fucking question! Arthur, put some eyes out the back, just in case. [GASPS] AARON: That's a fucking shotgun! What the fuck is this? -You fucking bitch! You set me up! -[LAUREN SCREAMS] What the fuck, Dean? -[DOOR OPENING] -RICHIE: Oi! [GUNSHOTS] [PHONE RINGING] [CHUCKLES] You better be on your way home. Mum? Mum! -I think I need your help! -[GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Is there another entrance to this place? I don't know, but I'll go and have a look. -Don't do nothing stupid. -Me? As if. Fuck! [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] THUG: Oh, fuck! [SCREAMS] Fucking hell! [SCREAMING AND CRYING] Shit. Give me a hand. WATT: Armed Response Team on the scene, ma'am. Currently securing lower floors. TAYLOR:Do we have any information on what's going on? Not yet. Still hearing occasional gunfire. Intelligence Service Team are en route. -TAYLOR:My daughter's in there. -OFFICER: Clear! She's smart enough to stay safe, ma'am. There's loads of them. [PANTS] And I mean fucking shitloads. [GUNSHOTS FIRE] Geez! Can't this lot fucking take a hint or what? [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] OFFICER: [OVER RADIO] Bravo team, sitrep. Stand back. -[WOMAN SCREAMING] -BUTCH: Hello, ladies. AARON: Right, can we fuck 'em up? -[ROY GRUNTS] -BUTCH: Roy. Fucking popped that prick! Got that prick! [LAUREN PANTING] -I'm sorry if you thought-- -Don't worry, I get it. I do really like you. Well, as second dates go, this is pretty memorable. We need to get out. bruv, the feds are coming, man. No, fuck that, man! We finish this today! Oi, keep firing. I got an idea. OFFICER: Police! Come on! -[DEAN GROANS] -AARON: Pussy'ole! No excitement, my arse. Old Bill are gonna be all over this place like a fucking rash soon. RICHIE: I can't say I'm gonna be sorry to see 'em now. Listen! I got your little traitor bitch here! You hear me? I'm gonna blow her fucking head off unless you come out now and put your guns down! I swear down! You got five fucking seconds, you hear me? -Five! -[LAUREN WHIMPERING] Four! Fucking shut up! Three! -Two! -[RICHIE SIGHS] Okay! I'm coming out. You bloody mental? That's suicide? You got a daughter, Butch, eh? No, I thought not. We got no choice. She's a kid. Okay. We're coming out. You fucking hurry up! Now put your hands where I can see them. All right, you got me. Now you can let her go, can't you? I fucking told you, didn't I, old man? And now you're dead. But first you gotta watch me waste your boys. Oh, you mean like the way we wasted yours? E2 is an army. One go, another one come. Oh, what, like cockroaches, all scuttling around in the shit? What you got, huh, Mr. Old School Gangster? I tell you what you got. You got about 30 seconds. So which one of you should I cap first? You? AARON: Get the fuck off of me! [PANTS] You dickhead. For fuck's sake, Richie, just shoot the little cunt! Oh, fuck it! [SIGHS] That was for Charlie. You're getting up? All right, this one's for me! OFFICER: Drop your fucking weapons! You wouldn't know when you're beaten, I'd say. [TRIGGER CLICKING] -Police! Put the weapon down! -[GUNSHOTS] You really expect me to believe it was self-defense? We told you what happened. We were all asleep, and suddenly these two fellas come in all tooled up. And you took their guns off them, you 70-year-old men? Oi, there's no need to be so insulting, Inspector. -I am the young gun on the firm. -[ROY CHUCKLES] Can you give us a minute? I'll be seeing you. Is this it? I don't know what you mean. Listen, I've got every armed copper in London crawling around outside, and if you want me to feed you to them, I will. So I'll ask you again, is this it? All I can tell you, Inspector is, as soon as I'm out of here, I'm going back to Spain. Now, you should count your blessings. You got nice, clean streets again. I think the people around your way deserve that, don't you? There is one last thing I want to say. And if I don't say it now, I probably won't get another chance. What's that? Thanks. -What for? -For saving my daughter. Hmm. CARMEN: How's the East End now? -Quiet. -I could've come, you know, -to the funeral. -Oh, you barely knew him. -Anyway, your place is there. -And yours? Is someone getting homesick? Or maybe you've met someone. I should be home by supper. Then I'll have something ready for you. No, no! I'm bringing some pies over for you to try. -Proper English grub. -[CARMEN CHUCKLES] Okay. Have a safe flight. I love you, Dad. You too. Bye. [CHUCKLES] I won't come outside. I hate goodbyes. We never did have that night out, did we? No, well, you've been a bit, um... [CLEARS THROAT] -busy. -Yeah. But you know, you could always come out to Spain. I'm gonna need a carer any minute now. -You're selling it so well. -[CHUCKLES] But, you know, the girls are here, and... it feels like home again, thanks to you. Well, the offer's always open, Lizzy. -Richie? -Yeah? You take good care of yourself, hey? [SIGHS] Fuck. BUTCH: And good riddance to him. ROY: Yeah. ARTHUR: Anyone who wants to ponce around in the sun playing golf rather than stay here is not worth knowing, mate. ROY: I can tell you're not lying. And I have to agree with you. After all we've been through recently, and he still turns his back on us. BUTCH: Just like what he'd done 20 years ago. Come on, lads, that's not fair. I was running away from Old Bill at the time, keeping my head down, taking the heat off you mugs. Who you calling a mug? So why have you stayed? And don't try lying to me. Lizzy?
