[theme music] [vehicle approaching] crash [jazz music] [door banging] [clapping in rhythm] [jazz music continues] [bell rings] Good morning to you, dear teacher [scatting] Good morning to you We really mean it Good morning to you Don't mean your sister I mean you're really in the groove Okay, Mr. Jones, you may recite your history for today. [upbeat music] Oh, Columbus was the discoverer of America And he sailed to sea in 1492 But the good Queen Isabella Found a more attractive fella And Columbus wound up in the jug-a-roo [drum beat] Oh! That's a killer, son, that's a killer. Come, now, Ms. Kitty Bright. Let's see if you did your homework right. [drum beat] Oh, Napoleon once was the fightiest man you ever saw Everybody that he fought with he subdued But the king-a and the queen-a Sent him off to St. Helena Just because they didn't like his attitude Oh! Let that be a lesson to you Everybody meets his Waterloo He wasn't too big to end up behind the 8-ball And remember, buddy, there's still a lot of room for you Now, Johnny, let's hear your sonnets. Make 'em sound like Kostelanetz. Oh-yo-do. Uh, Charleston. A-razz-a-ma-taz and a boop-boop-be-doop. Boy, is that corny. Argh. Come up here! [growls] [bell rings] Class dismissed. [laughing] - You swing like a rusty gate. - You ain't got rhythm. - Gee, is that awful! - What form! Here's your old frat pin. You can look me up when you learn how to swing. Why it's as easy as rolling off a log.. [melodic music] [jazz music] It was on the college campus that the kitties had a session All the cats were there 'twas a swinging congregation Some had took to talking While the cats beat out a rhythm And others picked on pecking 'Cause the rhythm bug had bit 'em They never had a lesson in their lives But rhythm swamped their teasing And when it comes to swinging their things It's as natural to them as sleepin' or eatin' There's a rumpus on the campus They are really in the groove Each and every paw has a natural urge to move They think this corn is known as horn They wish someone could stop it The only use their corn is when you pop it tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock [melodic music] I got it. I got it. The rhythm bug bit me. La-de-ah. tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock [upbeat music] screech! As easy As rolling off a log I've found it easy, baby To fall in love with you As easy as rolling cigarettes If that ain't easy maybe There's simpler things to do For instance let's cuddle I love to cuddle Get in a huddle it's easy with you As easy as rolling off a log I really tumble, baby But what else could I do? It's so easy to fall in love with you I know that it's as easy As rolling off a log It's awful easy, baby To lie the way you do It's as easy, baby As rolling off a log It's awful easy, baby To make me think it's To make me, to make me think that it's true 'Cause I've heard a few say The things that you say But if I do say I love you I do so help me it's true This love stuff has got me in a fog The boys all say they love me I wonder why they do It's so easy to fall in love with you [trumpeting] [jazz music] [jazz music continues] Now what else could I do? It's so easy To fall in love With you thud! mwah, mwah, mwah [theme music]
