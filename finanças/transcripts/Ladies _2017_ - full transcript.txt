Cheer up. I'm not sad. - Champagne? - No. Come on. Relax, have a drink. I'm fine. I'm relaxed, in a good mood. It's just my face. That's it. Are you okay? Yes. Really? Let's dance? Come on! Go ahead. I'll be right there. Oh, shit. It's the school. No need to scream. No, it's not the school. It's my sister. Don't worry. Go back to sleep. What's going on? What? Where are you? In a night club. When's my next check up? I need to come sooner. Could you see me in between two patients? Damn it, Lucie! It's 1 AM! What are you doing to me? I'm not well. Yes, well... I'm nauseous. Thanks. Tomorrow. What's wrong? She's in stress. Poor thing. Move over, babe. You're taking all the space. Come on. I thought she was cured? She is. So why is she stressed then? I don't know. Excuse me. What are you doing? You're leaving? Yes, I'm officially tired. I'm 40 years old. I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't have to time to waste with this crap. Come on. Stop it, Lucie. Sit down. Look. Just choose one. Him. The guy that's coming. He's hot. He look likes a car dealer. Come on. Give it a try. So, can I join you? Sophie's calling me. What are you celebrating? We both know you're here for my sister, now that she's gone, you're stuck with me. You're buying time, if you leave now, you'll look like asshole. But it's okay, you can go, you don't have to make conversation. I didn't think of it that way, but now, yes, I can't go, I'll look like an asshole. I was about to leave. If you leave, you'll look like a bitch. - Are you coming? - I'll be right there. Don't bother, I'm really not your kind. Girls would kill to be in your place. Why are you bothering me then? What's wrong? You don't like me? That's not what you think. You're asking yourself, how a girl like me can afford to say no to a guy like you. No, not at all. Clovis, come on. - We're waiting. - I'm coming. Come on. They're waiting. - What's your name? - Unbelievable. Unbelievable. That's not a name. You're unbearable. - Can I buy you a drink? - No, thank you. Can I buy you an ordinary life with a suburban home? No. - Can I buy you coffee? - No. - Can I buy you tea? - No. - Can I buy you a joint? - No. - Eat you out? - No. No! Can I offer you a dance? Come on. No. - Let's dance. - No, I was leaving. I dance like Patrick Swayze. No, I'm fine. Leave me alone. I don't want you, anyone, or this. I just want to be left alone. This is horrible. What's horrible? Your sliced breast. Aren't you disgusted seeing naked women all day long? You kidding? Best job in the world! They pay me to look. You look while you... Listen. I thought so. - I knew it. - What? You have nothing. Your breasts are fine. Okay? How are you feeling? Awful. Alone, you know. I mean I feel a little lost. When I was sick, I had a plan. I had meetings, people to see. People were nice. They would take care of me. When you're not used to it, even breakfast at 7 is nice. The hospital is actually like a Club Med. It hurts here. I'm tired. Everyone's gotten back to their lives and I'm a little lost. I'm too tired to run the store all day long. I feel alone. You need to think about the future now. What future? Start a new life. Which means? Doing Yoga. Like seeing friends. They're the past. I've changed too much. I have no more friends. Now, come on. You're fixed, that's important. I'll give you some aspirin. It'll ease the pain. And for your fatigue, the best is sports. It reduces recurrence. What do you mean recurrence? Don't think about that. Fall in love. It reduces your risks. I have to find a man now? Yes, love is... It's good for health. Like 5 fruits and vegetables a day. You idiot. - But I can't. - Yes, you can. Imagine I do find a man. He'll want to see me naked. Yeah, that's possible. I'm too destroyed for that. You know, honestly? It'll grow back. Yes? - Doctor? - Yes? Mrs. Marquez is here. I'll be right there. Mrs. Marquez, big patient. It's my main case. Come on. Hi, dear. I got you chocolate buns. What are you watching? TV. Grandma said you came for lunch. She said... What did Yvonne say? Bingo. You know... You're surfing the crimson tide. I have my period. We could celebrate? Do you want a gift? No. To mark the occasion. It's... You're a woman, now. Hortense, it's me, Mom. Are you okay? Need any help? "To give the direction of the functions' variations," the coordinates of the parabole's "summit, representing each value..." Well. Change your wig. - What? - You look like Morticia Addams. Change your wig. Okay. Hello. What can I do for you, babe? Nothing. Thank you. Just looking. Blonde. What? No, not blonde. My mom won't like it. Is it for you or your mom? For me. My mom's opinion counts. What cancer? I don't have cancer. Breast. Oh no, I don't think so. It's a good time to try. Yes but still, this... What? Make the most of it. Make a change. I'm used to people saying to enjoy life, but not, I mean, not my cancer. No one knows how to enjoy life. If there was a method everyone would be happy, Right? Well. Come here. Come along. Let's go. Come in, don't be afraid. Have a seat. Sit there. I'll be right back. Wait here. Wait for me. Yes, hello? 6 PM. Wear a comfortable jogging suit. See you later. Don't move. First rule. A woman always puts make-up on. Right? There. Incredible. I don't recognize myself. One third of beauty is due to nature, seven tenths is due to? To? - I don't know. - Finery. Thank you. You're welcome. Your mom's going to be happy. Mrs. Fayolles brought rhododendrons this morning. You think it's vulgar in a cemetery. Rhododendrons are vulgar. No flowers on your husband's grave is vulgar. Hurry up. We still have Alley B to do, and I'm meeting Catherine at 10:30. We're making packages for the black kids. We watched a video with Rosenberg's father. They have so much joy for life. You should do volunteer work. It keeps your mind off things. It helps to see poverty. Don't sit on the tombs! I've said it a thousand times. Fine. We don't sit on death's head. Pass me the spade. You didn't even notice I changed. Pass me the spade. I changed my wig. Mom? Talking to me? No, nothing. I'm worried about Hortense. She's a teenager. Teens are impossible. She didn't invent the concept. You have to get used to it. How was I younger? Not easy. Always sick to get more attention. Not easy. Hello? When you say "Leave me alone", is it to be taken literally or is it a nice way to ask me to have sex with you? Have you lost your mind? No, don't worry. I won't fall in love. For me, love is only to sell magazines, beauty creams and movie tickets. The truth is much less romantic. You're just calling to say that? We can talk over a drink? I don't know, Tuesday? Tuesday? Tuesday, Tuesday. I need to check. Because I've got lots to do. Tuesday? Oh, no, I can't. I've got something Tuesday night. Wednesday? Well Wednesday? Wednesday I have... Well, I've got a thing, nothing to do with the other thing, but it's a thing, so I can't on Wednesday. - Thursday? - Thursday? Well Thursday... Lucie! Yes? Yes, Thursday's fine. Thursday's good. Oh, shit. Who was it? Nothing. Come on. Hurry up. You're going to make me late. I have to be at the chaplaincy at 10. What's all this? You want to dance the French can-can? No, I just wanted to try. I'm upstairs. Dalila. Arch! Charlotte, arch! Come on. God gave you an ass for more than just sitting. Come on. There. And turn. Vivienne, if it's too hard, stop. There you go. Excuse me? Yes? Are you coming in or making a breeze? Enter. Come in. Again: pointe, pointe. Now stop. Hello. Good job. It was good. Hey, Gila. Bye. Drink water. And now the new girls. Come on. Everyone up. I came to return the wig. Thank you. Let's go. Line up. Line up in front of the mirror. Leave space around you. I just came to return the wig. There. I don't know. Look at yourself in the mirror. Observe yourself. What do you see? Everyone face the mirror. Stand straight. The mirror is in front of you. In front of you. Observe yourselves. Look at the mirror. You're so beautiful. Look at you. Come on, girls. Watch yourself. Look at the mirror, you too. No one is saying anything. What do you see? I see a fat cow. - Good. What's your name? - Farida. Farida. Touch your thigh. Touch your thigh. No, your thigh. Your skin. Touch your skin. Caress yourself. How is it? What do you feel? It's flabby. It's flabby. Close your eyes. Close your eyes but continue touching your skin. What do you feel now? It's soft. It's soft. There. It's soft. Come on. Close your eyes. And now caress yourself. Caress softly. Your butt, Your breasts. Caress yourself delicately. Ladies, I'm just like you. I hate wasting time. So if you think you're worth nothing, you're wasting my time and your own. Either you jump straight to "I am beautiful", and then we can start talking, okay? So, let's say it together. It's a training. Say, "I am beautiful." At my signal we'll say, "I am beautiful." Now. I am beautiful. Let's say it again with more faith and belief. Go. I am beautiful. Good job. More conviction next time. Luckily, we can learn to be a woman. - There. - Thank you. Hi. Hello. Something came up. It won't take long. Yeah. It's okay. I'll go. I've got things to do. No, we'll have a drink after. Come on. Hop on. No really, another time. Come on. - Where are we going? - Ready? Ready. No. Talk about an emergency! I was busy. You could have gone to dinner like that. Unkempt? Certainly not. I don't want people to take me for an old lady. You're not old. You're even too young to buy porn. He's nice. He comes every Tuesday to do my hair. Staying for dinner? Marie-Louise wants to see you. I'm having dinner with Lucie. Next time, okay? What do you mean next time? Next time she might be dead. I'm so glad to see Clovis. I know. Hello. Hello. How are you? How are you? Enjoy your meal. - I'll sit here. - Here? Yes, it's fine. Thanks for helping. You're sweet. Thank you. Hello. How are you? Hello, old man. - Hello. - Still alive? Is this your fianc√©e? No, we're not together. I haven't kissed her yet. What are you waiting for? We'd planned on drinks in a romantic place, but it's potatoes and ham with old folks, so... She won't get over that. Pretend we're not here. Won't be easy, worst date in my life! Come on! We want to know how you do it. Salome says you're an expert. Yes. Take out your pens. Takes some notes. First of all: watch the signals. If she swings her shoes on her toes, and if her feet slide in and out, you have her full attention. And you can make a move. What? I can't concentrate for all your lip-smacking. That's why you never get a girl. They don't care about us. They don't care? You can still be old and be a charmer. Drop the napkin! And you there. Get your nose out of the potatoes, you'll drown! It's not because they're in a badly lit dining room that they can't dream. They're ladies. You're gentlemen. Look at them, waiting for the same thing. We're in a home. We're all waiting for the same thing. Look at them. Really look at them. Look at her. She's touching her wrist. Maybe a green light. Maybe an opening. And her, over there. Need a drawing? Women want emotions. Feelings. To be loved, respected. They have to feel exceptional. They want to be a man's last love. That's it. We don't ask for that much. We want the same as you. Someone who loves us despite who we are. You see? There, see what I'm working on? - Besides that. - I'm fine. Thank you. I'm going. The keys... My helmet. My helmet. What? My helmet. Oh, that. Yes, it's nice. I'll keep it, if you don't mind. I need one actually. I don't have one. And I thought, seeing all the noise around here this should keep it down. Thanks for tonight. Send your address. I'll bring it back. Thank you. It was open. You're so slow, my dear. Look at your sister, she's six plants ahead of you. I'm sorry. I'm tired. Really. You don't look tired. You just woke up. You still have the pillow mark. Get yourself together. I planned a meeting with Jean. Who's Jean? The organ player. The gap-toothed guy? At your age, don't be so picky! Be happy he accepted. Jean never! I'm telling you. No way. Do it for Hortense. Adolescence is difficult for a teen. I'm struggling with Pauline. Glad, Stephan's here. You want some? No. Stop looking at yourself, you'll wear out the mirror. Look at your sister. She doesn't do that. I'm observing myself. Everywhere. All the time. I can't help it. I get in the car, and before turning the key, I look in the mirror, to observe. At red lights too. I do it on my computer screen, in elevators, window shopping, in knifes, spoons, in others' fucking sunglasses. I watch myself. It doesn't look like me. It's not me. My reflection doesn't match, so I check. Pretty people don't look at themselves, people who hate themselves do. At the hospital, I was ugly inside and out. There: broken means loved. It mustn't have been easy for your doctors. It's hard to be cured from being sick. Good, girls. Rest. Relax. Challenge those bodies. After vacation, we'll start serious stuff. You'll learn the art of striptease. Striptease? Like Dita Von-Teese? No, not like Dita Von-Teese. You won't dance in a champagne glass. Too bad. In two months, you must be ready. Which means? - Our big show. - What? You're not here to compare your underwear. When you're with a woman, you announce who you are. You are at ease, in front of everybody. We'll get naked for people? It's called an audience. No way. It won't be possible. What's not possible, babe? Taking my clothes off in front of people. I can't. I can't dance with a feather up my ass in front of Mom! Yes, you can. It will kill her. Double screen, dear. What? Double screen. You're on your phone and on your computer. Can you handle your dinner tonight? Going out? Yes, I mean, I'm returning something to a friend. How do I look? Very nice. Thank you very much. See you later. Fuck. Damn it. Go see over there. This sucks. - Got it. - Bring it here. Fuck. Here's your helmet. So? So what? How long since you've had sex? I don't know. Three days? Three months? Three years! My God. Okay. - I'll take care of it. - Wait, can't we talk first? Thank you. So that's how you hit on girls? Japanese tea... and vinyls. I mostly listen to them, make them talk. And that's enough? Yes, normally. Don't worry, everything stays inside these walls. Bound by professional secrecy. I put my sympathy face on to look interested. Then I put on a porn. Yeah. Fine. Okay let's go. Show me. Not the porn! Before that: the listening and sympathy. You have to admit something to me. Like what? Incest, rap, illness, I take it all. Okay. Well... When I was a little, I wanted to be a dancer. I was pretty good but my mom didn't want me to. That's good. I'll find something else. You have nothing to feel sorry for? You're fine. You don't have any problems? For you, I have a secret weapon. - A secret weapon that always works? - Yes. Perfect. And then you get the girls in bed? Normally. I warn you, it won't work on me. What a clich√©. Do they really go for that? No way. If you insist. Sorry. No. I need to go to the bathroom. On your right. What is all that stuff in the bathroom? No, it's the shopping channel. Yes, I know exactly what it is. It's because I'm insomniac. - So I buy it all. - All of it? - I buy it all. - You do? All of it. Nobody buys all of it. My grandmother and I do. She calls late at night to give me tips. There's a special offer, buy it. So I buy it. You don't actually use this? Sometimes. Never. Visorelax. This is for women. Maybe, but it's for bags under the eyes. You do buy it all! All of it. Got the Crunch Fit too? And the Rock Gym Master. It's upstairs. - Really? - Yes. - You don't have the cooking slicer? - In the kitchen. - With the mandolin? - Of course. I hate you. - I have the shoe-cutter. - Sure, it's a basic. I've got two of them. - And better... - What? I've got the sweeper. - Maxi Sweep. - Yes, exactly. With the telescopic branch? With lights to get under furniture. - So? - I'm impressed. Although you're alone and very pathetic. Yes, but before, I was alone, pathetic, and didn't have the Renov Special body, so I'm getting better. Any other defects? I've got a stock of scented candles. Well, that's okay. What? I have to get up early. What are you doing? Nothing. Why did you come over? To bring back your helmet. - For my helmet? - Well, yes. Are you kidding me? No. It's just... You can't understand. I'm sorry. You changed your hair? You don't like it? I love it. It's looks good. Did you meet a guy? No. I mean, I don't know. There's a guy named Clovis. I don't think I'm ready. Really? It tastes like piss. Fuck, I'm tired. I'm fed up. Really? I may start using cocaine. - No. - Yes. Stop it! Don't worry. I have an operation in one hour. - Hello, Dr. Larchet. - Hi, Celine. Fine and you? See you later? See you! Well, well. I'm not made for this. Made for what? To be happy, people, happiness, you know. I'm allergic to happiness. Or worse, happiness is allergic to me. I'll end up alone. I don't understand anything about life. Siri? What's the meaning of life? I don't think there is a consensus on the matter. Siri? What's the meaning of life? I don't know, but I think there is an application for that. Stop it, you're going to break it. All evidence points to chocolate. There you have it. That's good. Everyday I see people die. Life is a vast joke. So please take what's fun and stop worrying about the rest. Sorry, I'm late. It's my husband. He forget Sofiane's backpack. He can't handle three children. How does he handle employees? Three backpacks, three notebooks, three lunch boxes. No need to be a rocket scientist. How do they handle a war? Damn, I forgot the missiles! I goofed up. - How was it this morning? - Great. We learned how to take our bra off. Gee! Claudette's the most gifted one. I've shown my breast ten times a day for six months, I've got practice. No wonder. We did this exercise with chairs. Lucie did this thing. She looked like Lisa Minnelli. We're flexible in my family. I get it from my mom. Flexibility along with her cancer gene. I can't believe I missed the class. Tonight, I'll be a pin-up for my husband. It's going to be hot. You all have boyfriend, husbands? Yes. Don't you? No. Ready to show who you are? We need an audience. I asked Damien. He does the lighting here. I also found this gentleman. Didier. Excuse me? What do you do at the cabaret? I clean. Good. That'll work just fine. Before performing for a real audience, you'll do the Full Monty. You'll go one by one on stage, totally naked, for ten seconds. Butt naked? No, I can't. I'm going to dance naked for Damien and Didier. You're brave. - So? - I can't. I'll never make it. Sure, you will. Act like a naked baby. Come on, look! Wiggle your ass like this. Look at me with my big butt. Let's start with Claudette. Bravo! I didn't think you'd call. Neither did I. Why do you collect all those girls? My therapist says it's a narcissistic upgrading. I collect girls to fill a gap. Why do you need upgrading? Because of my nose. What's wrong with your nose? I'd get made fun of at school. Your nose is fine. It's not. It's like Sarkozy's nose. Look. No, you don't. What should I say? - You have a pretty nose. - It's horrible. Stop it. And you're very pretty. No one has ever called me pretty. Lucie? Scoot over. You need to be strong. So I... I saw the results. They're not good. There is recurrence. So I think we're going to have to think about doing a mastectomy. We need to remove both breasts. It's better to play safe. In a couple of months, when you're healed, I'll make you new ones. I'll do... I'll do the same as Kim Kardashian. Okay? Is that okay? No, I want the same as Angelina Jolie. Remember? I used to crawl in your bed. Storms scared me! You were afraid of everything. A storm is creepy when you're a kid. No, not really. Lucie, open the door. Come on. Fuck. How long are you going to play dead? What's your problem? It's too soon to be scared. You know, Lucie... The girls I meet are just for sex. It's different with you. Your temperament sucks. What do you want? I want to know you. I want to know everything. I want to see you when you're well, when you're sick. I want to see you lie to me. I want to know on what side of the bed you sleep. What makes you laugh. What makes you cry. Lucie? You're really a pain in the ass. You're late. Wait here, don't move. I said don't move. Stop it. So, ready for Tuesday's show? I can't wait. My parents are coming, my boyfriend. I'm so happy. It's going to be a shocker. How about you? Any family coming? What's wrong? I'm not doing the show. Recurrence? Mastectomy? Yes. Not doing the show. Giving up once is giving up forever. You're a woman. You know how to fight. The femininity inside you is your weapon. Be kind to yourself. Be kind. Put diamonds on where it hurts. Put feathers in your hair and ribbons on your bandage. You'll say goodbye to your breasts in style. You'll see. You'll see. I'm sorry. We're closed. - One rose! - Register's closed. We can sell him one. I'm sick of husbands who forget birthdays! He should of thought of it before. You're welcome. You've been away for too long! We weren't going to leave him like that. You know what? You'll handle the register. I don't know how. Besides, I have... I've done everything for four years. I take care of everything. You have to get it together. Of course, the cancer isn't your fault. Did you ever think about what I'm going through? You're not sick anymore. I'm tired too. I have a life you know. I have a parents-teacher meeting. I don't care how, but you're doing the counting, you're closing the store, and I'm leaving. - Are you crazy? - What about your meeting? What meeting? The parent-teacher meeting? It wasn't a parent-teacher meeting. He stood me up. What do you mean? Stop acting prude. Stephan's never home. He screws all the girls at the office. He cheats on you? Never know what can happen. You were just dancing naked. Want to talk about it? It's a sort of goodbye ceremony. They're removing my breasts. That can't be! I'm sorry. Can I give you mine? Take mine. I don't need them anyways. No more babies, an invisible husband. Why are men obsessed with breasts? I don't know. There you go. There too. What do I do now? I don't know. - Take a hit. - No. - Just one, it's fine. - No, I'm good. Who do you think is the hottest? Lucie or Manon? I don't look at my mom's ass. It's just my mom. I think my mom's hot. She could have had a smarter man than Dad. Hortense's headed for trouble. It's difficult for her. If only your sister could hold on to a man. 6 PM that's good, okay? Great. I can't believe it. It's tonight. Yes. See you. Don't put too much garlic. Last week you put too much. - Auntie Lucie! - Hi, sweethearts! Adam, wait for me. A hug. Over there, my kiss. - What? - Are you going out after? - I swear, you're hot. - No, stop it. That's nice. How are you? Did you tell mom? - I'm afraid to. - Why? She'll say I'm doing it for attention. - Shall I tell her? - No, I will. - I can. - No, I will. I need to find the right time. Lucie! There. Go on. See you later. Don't eat all the bread. Yes? Be helpful. Snap those beans. How are you doing, Mom? Fine. I'm doing fine. Why are you asking? I don't know. I guess no one asks you. I'm doing fine. - Need help for anything else? - No, thank you. Mom? I need to tell you something. What are you doing? Snapping the ends off. Why are you doing all the beans? We're not an army. - That's wasting. - What should I have done? One kilo. Frederic's kids don't eat beans. What am I going to do with all these green beans? Make necklaces for black kids. What are you drawing? Dad, Mom, Adam and me. Who's that? That's me. - Oh, you're a princess? - Yes! Yes, girls are princesses, I'm so stupid. And who's that? Dad? No, it's my prince. Handsome prince! - Nice boots. - Thank you. - Very nice. - What about yours? Princes don't exist. The wicked witch cast a spell on the princess. So the princess is all broken, and a prince likes a princess who's got everything in place. Not when they break parts off. So the princess left. Julianne, come say hi to Grandma. - Come on. - Go on. Go see her. Shit. He left you? No, I left. Did you tell him? No, he doesn't know. What do you mean? I didn't say anything. What? I swear, Lucie, what world are you living in? Guys are only assholes in movies. In real life, men are not assholes. They kiss you, they hold your hand, and say everything will be okay. Okay. Go see him. - No, I'll go tonight. - Go there now. I'll tell him tonight. What do you mean? No, tell him now. Does he live far away? Not far. We're having lunch. You kidding me? I'll handle Queen Mom. Go now. Move your ass. Or smell my feet. Go! - I swear! - Wanna smell my feet? - Go! - You're disgusting. Go on. Mom? Mom! Yes? Can you make me French fries, please? French fries? Yes, French fries. Fresh ones and cut thin slices. Like a beef carpaccio, but fries. French fries. My God. I'll explain my problem. So. Well. I... Uhm... I... You showed her your toothpaste collection? No. What did you want to tell me? Nothing. You know what, forget it. It doesn't matter. Is everyone here? Can we eat? Yes, Mom. The lamb is beautiful. Very beautiful. A little more. Finish this first. - Not too much for Lucie. - Green beans? No thank you. I have my fries. Where are my fries? Give me my fries. Hortense, please go put on a descent outfit. Go remove the make-up. Come back when you're descent. What are you talking about, Mom? Her shirt is funny. This is my table. At my table, we dress descently. And if my rules are a problem, you may leave. You can go. Pauline, honey, go get your sweater. Come on. Lucie, you could lecture your daughter. No, I won't lecture my daughter! She's a noble person. She doesn't cheat and doesn't care what others think. At 15, she's doing what I never did: being herself. She can do and dress as she likes. She can even dance naked. I will always be proud of her. Pauline? I'm stoned. You're what? I'm stoned. Okay. I can't believe it. I'm going to have a glass of wine. Yeah, me too. Mom, a drink? - No. - Yes. Never on Sundays. I think you deserve a drink, Mom. Too much virtue, Mom, it's the worst vice. - A glass? - No. - A glass? - Well... With some cocaine? Just to salt your dish and have a good meal. It's not... Hortense didn't smoke, you know. - She's having her coffee now. - I know. - Mom? - No. I'm having my coffee. You never give up. You think I'm ugly? You never give up. You'll follow me to my grave. When we were kids, you enrolled us in dance class. Remember? No. I loved it, remember? On gala night, you came backstage, and wouldn't allow me to go on. That story again. We watched Manon dance from the stands. You were fat! Everyone would have made fun of you. You think I'm ugly? I met your dad right after medical school, I was 19 years old. He was so handsome. I was so young. I knew nothing about life. I never understood why he chose me. I thought he would leave me for a prettier woman. I made him pay all our life. And he never left me. Each time I see you, I see your father. You have his mouth, his eyes. Each time I see you, I see your father. When you had your cancer, I was afraid. Afraid to lose you. Lose you and forget your father's face. There. Happy now? Can I drink my coffee? I hope... No. I don't but... - Did you try? - Yes. The movement. Are you anxious? - A little. - So am I. What. What. What. Love what you do. Be serious without being serious. Take everything that comes with no judgment. Listen to my advice, take the good ones, forget the bad. And never regret, right? And now, go dance. Dance. Are you okay? Calm down. Where are you? Alone at a bus shelter? I'll be right there. Stay where you are. It's my daughter. Oh, not now... Take my place. I'll hurry back. It took me 70 years to show off who I am. We're almost up, and still no Lucie. All of this for nothing. What about us? - Do we cancel? - No. Holy shit! What? I could tease you so bad! - This is nothing. I'll explain later. - I'm listening. It's nothing. I striptease. That's all. I'm on soon. Hurry, or I'll miss the show. You do striptease? I'll tell you all about it later. It's therapeutic. It's for learning self-esteem. You get naked for self-esteem? Yes, and for body awareness. What? You make me laugh. Who's the jerk who left you so late at night? It's was Louis. He wanted... I split. You were at his place? Does his mom know? Yes. What did he want? He wanted my math homework. Well, it's not that... He wanted to sleep with me. I didn't, so I left. I'll call Frederic, he'll pick us up. I don't know what I'd have become without you. I'm proud to be your mother. What are we going to do without Lucie? Come on. Move. Come on. - Floor it! - I can't. Just pass him. Can you explain why I'm here in the middle of the night with Lucie dressed like a hooker? Lucie has a surprise. You'll love it. Come on. Might as well. Bring me home. I'm tired of Lucie's antics. Can you go any faster? What? What's your problem? Bring me home. I'm old. I need to sleep early. You'll still be old tomorrow, Grandma. Take that! - Damn! - I can't believe it. - Sorry. - If I was driving, we'd be there! Really? And this in your face? Cut it out! - Calm down. - Just shut up. Watch the road. - Stupid bitch! - Don't dis me. Mom? Are you listening? Stop whining. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. I can't stand you guys. Stop! I'll toss one of you out. He started it. You don't even say anything, mom. Filthy favorite. I don't have a favorite. I love you all the same. Come on. Quick. Hurry up. I'm trying. Excuse me. Any woman can do this? If one day I want to... Of course, babe. God changed his mind, he let women free. You okay, Grandma? I was in boarding school. Believe me, I've seen worse. Lucie is very brave. I know. She's my daughter. He left. Yeah, but we're here. Are you Lucie Larchet? I'm your Uber driver, Frederic. You have water and mint candy at your disposal. You can also charge your mobile phone. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. Come on. And after, he'll give you Angelina's breasts. Really big ones. That way, maybe I can shag Brad Pitt. You can be so vulgar. That's not how I raised you. Mom, you're so annoying. Don't you know when to shut up? Lucie needs comforting words once in a while! You're a pain with your jibe. What is she to think except she's not good enough for you? You know what? Vulgarity isn't about big boobs or shaking your ass. Lack of tenderness. Lack of love. That's vulgarity. That's what makes people ugly. Listen to her getting on her high horse, and cursing too! That's not how I raised you. Yes, you did, Mom! See? She's embarrassed. Ready? Well, they were too small. No, they weren't, your hands are too big. Make her breasts the size of my hands. Subtitling TITRAFILM
