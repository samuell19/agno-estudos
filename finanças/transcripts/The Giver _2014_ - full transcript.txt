{\i1}Transcript by hearing by Pippo{\i} OF RUINS AND ASHES WERE ERECTED {\i1}COMMUNE{\i}. PROTECTED FROM THE WORLD WITH THEIR IMPASSABLE BOUNDARIES. ALL THE MEMORIES OF THE PAST HAVE BEEN ERASED. {\i1}After the ruin, we started over.{\i} {\i1}Creating a new society.{\i} {\i1}One of true equality.{\i} {\i1}Rules were the building blocks of that equality.{\i} {\i1}We learned them as new children.{\i} {\i1}Rules like: use precise language,{\i} {\i1}...wear your assigned clothing,{\i} {\i1}...take your morning medication,{\i} - {\i1}Injected.{\i} - {\i1}...obey the curfew,{\i} {\i1}...never lie.{\i} THE GIVER {\i1}My name is Jonas.{\i} {\i1}I don't have a last name.{\i} {\i1}None of us do.{\i} {\i1}That day, the day before graduation,{\i} {\i1}I admit it, I was scared.{\i} {\i1}Tomorrow we'll be assigned our job.{\i} {\i1}Our purpose.{\i} {\i1}Seemed everyone knew theirs already.{\i} {\i1}Not me.{\i} {\i1}I was lost.{\i} {\i1}I always felt like I saw things...{\i} {\i1}Differently.{\i} {\i1}Saw things other people didn't.{\i} {\i1}I never said anything.{\i} {\i1}I didn't wanna be different.{\i} {\i1}Who would?{\i} Jonas. I apologize for the late. I got Asher to come say goodbye the teacher. I accept your apology. {\i1}Asher and Fiona.{\i} {\i1}We've been friends our whole lives.{\i} {\i1}Asher was the boy who made everyone laugh.{\i} {\i1}Fiona, well,{\i} {\i1}she was the girl who made everyone smile.{\i} Whoever's listening, please-please, do not make me vice chair for their waste management. Please! {\i1}We lived in a world were differences weren't allowed.{\i} {\i1}There was no "popular",{\i} {\i1}no "fame",{\i} {\i1}no "losers", and no "winners".{\i} {\i1}Our elders have eliminated all of that{\i} {\i1}so there will be no conflict between us.{\i} {\i1}Fear, pain,{\i} {\i1}envy, hate...{\i} {\i1}There weren't words so much as sounds.{\i} {\i1}Their echoes were gone to the other side of history.{\i} {\i1}I'm asked if I should apologize for what I did.{\i} {\i1}I'll let you decide.{\i} I'm going to miss volunteering here. Oh, no. If ever there's a person born to work at the nurturing center. I could be surprised, right? Jonas, if you have to guess of all the positions the elders peek for me. NURTURING CENTER Nurturing center. {\i1}Welcome to the nurturing center.{\i} I got this. I got this. Think heavy. Think heavy. - Come on. Come on. We win! Aren't you my chubby champion? Which one was heavier? - Mine. Asher. Father, I think Fiona put her finger on the scale. Did not. Uh, this little guy didn't qualify for tomorrow's ceremony. He's just not strong enough to be assigned to a family yet. He looks so unhappy. It's okay, Jonas, you can open it. Oh, yeah, it's Jonas. Here, let me. There you go. There you go, it's okay. Some people have it, huh? - That's just not fair. Be strong, Gabriel. You looked at his name? Isn't that against the rules? Yeah. It... it is. I just thought having a name would help him grow. So... so I whisper it to him when no one can hear. Sometimes I call him Gabe. He's usually so restless when the nurturers are here. You okay? - What? Yeah. I'm fine. So the old man turns to the elder and says, "do you know who I am?" And the elder says, "sir, I know you're old, "but that's no excuse for being prideful." And then the old man says, "no, really, I'm asking, who am I?" I don't get it. "Who am I", like... Like he forgot who he was. Okay, well, wouldn't the joke be better if the old man says... Okay, one... - What? - Two. Three! Aren't we graduates now? You do this every time. Come on. - Okay. One, two, three... go! There you go. So, I guess this is it. The last night of our childhood. I guess everything's gonna be different. No. Tomorrow the only thing that changes is what we do. It doesn't change who we are. Quick question: Who are we? - Friends. Friends forever. - Yes. Even when you both decide to be birth-mothers. Hey! Well, I guess we'll find out tomorrow, huh? {\i1}Citizens are reminded{\i} {\i1}that evening recreation will end in 30 minutes.{\i} {\i1}Thank you.{\i} Well, he did need to be rehabilitated. I know he was lily's teacher, but what was I supposed to do? I feel... Disappointment. What was the elders decision? - Release to elsewhere. Can I be released to elsewhere, mother? Even just for one day. No, you're too young lily-Billy. Jonas, your turn for feelings. Well, I guess I'm sort of... Terrified. Precision of language. I mean, anxious. When you were about to graduate did you ever feel... Like there was no position meant for you? They've been watching since you were a new child. The elders are never wrong. You'll find your place. {\i1}Welcome, citizens, to the annual ceremony of advancement.{\i} {\i1}Please stand by for a transmission.{\i} Good morning, community. Good morning, chief elder. I appologize for my remote attendance. We accept your apology. I can't be at every ceremony... In person. But here's a secret: You are my favorite community. However, because we do not lie, I readily admit I say that to every community. Beginnings. From disorder and chaos, from great suffering, great pain. From confusion and envy and hatred, came a solution: Communities. Serene, beautiful places, where disorder became harmony. Thank you. Let me get through it. Oh, fine. It begins, the ceremony. CEREMONY OF RELEASE TO ELSEWHERE Ceremony of the release to elsewhere. {\i1}Honoring the elderly citizens who have devoted their work{\i} {\i1}to the beauty and harmony of our beloved community,{\i} {\i1}and are now ready for joyous retirement to elsewhere.{\i} {\i1}Celebrating the new children,{\i} {\i1}proudly engineered by our esteemed geneticists.{\i} Abigail. {\i1}Produced by our honored birth-mothers,{\i} {\i1}these infants will now join their assigned family units.{\i} CEREMONY OF THE NINES {\i1}Reaching their half-way mark towards graduation{\i} {\i1}our nines today receive{\i} {\i1}a symbol of their developing independence and responsibility.{\i} {\i1}Celebrating the graduates,{\i} {\i1}who today will be assigned their positions in our community.{\i} Good luck. - You too. All of your training has been to help you fit in. To curb any impulse that may set you apart from others. But today, we honor your differences for they have determined your future. Here are the leaders, and the teachers, and the workers, and birth-mothers of tomorrow. And I think we're in very good hands. Number one, Madeleine. Birth-mother. Thank you for your childhood. Number two, Ross. Instructor of the middles. Thank you for your childhood. Number 51, Asher. Unruly, careless. Sometimes those most in need of responsibility learn best by being a practitioners of it. Drone pilot. Thank you for your childhood. You can keep it! Thanks. Number 53, Ionda. Recreation leader. Thank you for your childhood. Number 54, Cathy... They skipped Jonas. Thank you for your childhood. Number 78... Lloyd. Geneticist. Thank you for your childhood. Number 83. Yao. Harmony. Power cycle technician. Number 96... Chris... Thank you for your childhood. Food makers. Number 100, Quinn. Caretaker of the old. Number 104, Fiona. From the beginning it was clear, Fiona flourished working with new children. Fiona. Nurturer. Thank you for your childhood. Number 105, Luccia. Instructor of the twelves. Number 120, Jack. Department of justice assistant. Judd. Nutrition technician. Thank you for your childhood. Number 150, Pierre. Groundskeeper. Thank you for your childhood. You feel I have made a mistake. I apologize to my community. We accept your apology. Number 52, please step forward. Jonas has not been assigned a position. Jonas has been selected. We were not hasty this time, we could not afford another failure. Jonas possesses all four attributes: Intelligence, integrity, courage, and one I can name but... I cannot describe, the capacity to see beyond. But I must warn you, your training involves pain. Pain far beyond anything we know. Are you strong enough? Do we think Jonas is brave enough? Jonas, you have been selected as our next receiver of memory. Thank you for your childhood. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Put me up, please. - Okay, this foot. Yep. That one. Got it. Sit back. Sit back. - Is Jonas now more powerful than you? What did the chief elder mean when she said we cannot afford another failure? Well, ten years ago the receiver... We do not speak of it. You've been greatly honored. You got it. Go. Go. Go. You got it. You got it. - What you're doing? I should probably catch lily. - What are you doing? Good. - I can fly! Good. RECEIVER {\i1}Receiver of memory.{\i} {\i1}Five rules.{\i} {\i1}One, report directly to the receiver of memory for your training.{\i} {\i1}After training, return immediately to your dwelling.{\i} {\i1}Two, from this moment,{\i} {\i1}you are exempt from all rules governing rudeness.{\i} {\i1}You may ask any question.{\i} {\i1}Three, aside from your daily injections{\i} {\i1}you may not receive other medicines.{\i} {\i1}Especially those for pain.{\i} {\i1}Injected. S752.{\i} {\i1}Four, you may not discuss your trainning with anyone.{\i} {\i1}Ever.{\i} Yours look so important. I don't know. I stick out. Well, yeah, there's only one receiver of memory. - Two. What do they say, again, you have the capacity to see beyond? Yeah. Can't wait to hear every single detail. {\i1}Five, you may lie.{\i} {\i1}Asher and I, we used to dare each other to get close to his place.{\i} {\i1}It was built right on the edge.{\i} {\i1}We'd all heard of people getting lost to the edge,{\i} {\i1}never to be seen again.{\i} {\i1}And yet, here I was.{\i} {\i1}Being told that I'd have to get close to it every day...{\i} {\i1}For the rest of my life.{\i} {\i1}Welcome.{\i} Hi. I'm Jonas, I'm... {\i1}- Please, gaze at the sensor.{\i} {\i1}Welcome, receiver of memory.{\i} They're called books. Your books. Uh, my name is... - I know who you are. Of course. I apologize. I apologize...? Don't say that. "I apologize." Don't apologize to me ever again. Not here. You haven't the time. "I apologize." That's an automatic pleasantry. Doesn't mean anything. I apologize-- I'm sorry, I mean... We are here for only one purpose. Simply stated, though it isn't really simple at all, I will transmit you all the memories that I hold within me. Memories of the past. I would be very interested to learn about your life. No, no. Not... Not my life. You'll learn the secret history of the world. Before me, before you, generations back and back and back. When things were different, when there was more. More? The... chair. You see, no one in our community has any memory of the past. Only me. When the elders need guidance on matters that are beyond their experience, I provide wisdom. That is now your role. To provide guidance in the present using memories of the past. Move closer. Where to begin? Move closer. Closer. There is no way for me to prepare you for what I'm going to do now. You can take comfort in knowing you are completely helpless. If any of this prove to much for you, tell me immediately. I just have-- {\i1}"silent night{\i} {\i1}"holly night{\i} {\i1}"all is calm..."{\i} That was... it was... How that happened? - What do you mean, "how"? It happened. It's impossible. And yet it happened. - Well, why? Why don't we have... That... thing. Come on there. The memories, they give you the word. It's not a "thing", it's... Sled! - Sled. And the... ...snow. - Snow. Did my parents have them? Did you? No, no. It is a very distant memory. Simply stated, there is no snow because of climate control. But why don't people know about them? I mean, what so dangerous about the memory of a sled? What so dangerous? Well, for a sled you need snow. Snow is cold. Cold destroys crops. Which meant farmers couldn't farm. Unpredictable weather. Hills, mountains, made it difficult to transport food. Then we had hunger, starvation, famine. Everything is connected. Everything is at balance. With good there is always bad, and the two... Show me more. Let's go for a walk. A real one, with your legs. At the bottom of the hill, I saw something. Like a place. Home. - Home. Yes. Home, like a dwelling. {\i1}Receiver, good day.{\i} No. It is different. A dwelling is not a home. A home is more. Your instructions said I can lie. Do you lie? Oh, all the time. Mostly for personal amusement. But I won't lie to you. How do I know that's not a lie? There was someone else before me. What happened to them? One more question. If I'm now the receiver, what does that make you? Well, then that must make me... The giver. So, how was it? It was good. What did you do? We just talked. What else? That's it. You seem different. - How do you mean? {\i1}I'll deal with it tomorrow.{\i} {\i1}He can't settle down, no matter what I do.{\i} You said you'll look after him. {\i1}I know. I know. - I apologize.{\i} I accept your apology. Thank you, dinah. - Thank you. Hey. Gabriel! - How does Jonas know the child's name? Jonas met Gabriel the other day. He's so cute! Hello. - Would you like to issue me a warning, director of justice? This is just for a while, mother, till the little guy catches up. I think we're all in agreement that he sleeps in my room. Only if the elders say it's okay. They will. Yeah. Lily, give me your comfort object. Come on, lily. It's time for bed. Look at this. - Bye, baby. This is a mythical creature called a hippo. And it's incredibly fast because it has... One, two, three, four, five legs. {\i1}We had the same mark.{\i} {\i1}I almost didn't need to see this to know.{\i} {\i1}I felt it.{\i} {\i1}Felt that one day Gabriel would be chosen, too.{\i} A hippo, Gabe. Yeah, yeah. That's the pain they all talk about. No. Not even close. Did you... - It had a face. Wait, was that thing alive? Don't skip ahead. Did you notice anything about it? Yes. It hurt. No, any quality? Well, maybe. I think I saw it in my friend Fiona's hair. My first was yellow. If you thought the sled was special... Wha... It's... Red. Just like her hair. - Yes. There's red, green, blue. Many different colors. You'll see them all in time. But our people, they chose to do away with all of them. Color, race, religion. They created sameness. If we were different, we could be envious, angry, resentful, consumed with hatred. We need sameness. Don't you think? - Oh, I completely agree. But still... It's all so... Beautiful. {\i1}It always said elsewhere was so far away,{\i} {\i1}but it wasn't.{\i} {\i1}It was right there.{\i} {\i1}Close enough to touch.{\i} Jonas, have you fallen? Do you need immediate help? No. Uh, I-- I was just... What's going on with you? Nothing is going on with me. - No, you're right. That's totally normal to lie in the grass and stare at the sky. No, I was just... You're seeing something, aren't you? Can't you tell me? Give me your hands. What do you see? Oh, my goodness. - You see it? Yes. It's water. Well, come on. Concentrate. Hi. Jonas was just teaching me about his training. As you could see, it's incredibly interesting. Can't be half as great as mine. Care you have your minds blown? Do you know how to fly those? Absolutely. Sort of. I'm learning. When I'm flying, looking down at everything, it's like I'm seeing things for the very first time. You get to fly into elsewhere? Oh, yeah. - Once when I was looking at that mist, even though they tell us there's nothing close to the edge, I thought I saw a tree out there somewhere. Don't get too excited. I've actually seen elsewhere. It's just mostly our farms, weird rocks, that kind of stuff. What's weird about them? There's these two huge rocks, leaning against each other. Making a kind of triangle. Hey, it's kind of like our triangle. What's past there? - Don't know. We're not allowed to fly past that. So many secrets. So what are your secrets? Uh... nothing. - What do you mean, "uh... nothing?" You're receiver of memory. Maybe I can show you. Okay, grab a tray. - What? Bring it over to the solar plate. Come on. Now, this might seem a little funny, but you got to trust me. Okay, sit down on the tray. Careful. - Whoa, whoa, you're not gonna... What, you scared? - I'm scared of nothing. No, I just... It's against the rules, Jonas. Since when do you care about the rules? Actually, I have auxiliary training. I'll see you guys. Look who grew up. But, lucky for you, I haven't. Okay... Now, go! Put your hills down. Slow it. I think your training may be a bit more fun than mine. {\i1}Please stand by for a community announcement.{\i} {\i1}Citizens are reminded{\i} {\i1}that it is impolite to touch community members{\i} {\i1}outside your family unit.{\i} {\i1}Thank you.{\i} He's punctual. He's inquisitive. How inquisitive? He's interested in his position. Then why is he breaking the rules? He has been observed trying to share his training with his former classmates. That always happens. But... but it's an impossible experiment. Even I tried to share the memories back when I was in training. If you remember. So... forget about it. I don't tell you what to do in your position, so don't tell me. I apologize, but isn't that what's happening now? Your apology is accepted, but you are being careless. You're moving too fast, and we both know what happened ten years ago with the girl. The girl had a name. You think I don't remember her name? I know you feel the loss. The boy must hold in the pain. Don't fail us again. You want me to read all these? Huh. What's this? "One day you shall meet a boy "who answers to the name of Jonas. "He shall be the most powerful of all the receivers." Wait. That says...? - Don't be gullible. PLAN FOR SAMENESS "Plan for sameness." Another trick? Actually, no. It's some kind of map. The triangle of rocks. Hey, that's real. My friend, Asher, saw it. Whoa, look at all these towers. What were they for? How did your friend see the triangle of rocks? He's a pilot. He told me. He saw it. What's past there? What's past "the outer edge?" "Boundary of memory?" A mystery. "Boundary of memory," is that what they build so the memories would only stay within you and me? Let's move on. Wait. That boundary is meant to keep memories in. So if a receiver crosses it... Is that mean the memories get set free? Perhaps. Perhaps if you or I crossed it everyone could feel those memories again. So, what am I seeing today? Nothing. You're seeing nothing today. We've already covered seeing beyond. There's also such a thing as hearing beyond. The table? All the food will slide to the floor. Now, don't judge me, I'm-- I'm not very good, even though I had a very good teacher. Music. Well, music when I hit the right keys. Just like music, there's something else you can't see with your eyes. Something who lives inside you. Something your morning injections take away. I thought the injections are for our health. No, they remove something. What? Emotions. You mean, like feelings. Feelings are just needed on the surface. But emotions, they're very deep, primal, they linger. But Jonas, you might not understand where you are or what's happening, but don't think about what you're seeing. Listen. Listen to what's calling from inside. {\i1}Antonio!{\i} {\i1}Beautiful wedding!{\i} Hey! Why would anyone want to get rid of this? Good question. What are you doing? - Take my hand. Ready? - Uh... You ready for the fast part? And turn! Spin! - What are you doing with her? Jonas said it's called dancing. {\i1}Please stand by for a transmission.{\i} I apologize for my intrusion. We accept your apology. - We accept your apology. I just wanted to say hello. {\i1}Hello.{\i} {\i1}I'm lily.{\i} Yes, I know. You're a nine now, isn't that right? Lily, I think it's time for school. We better get going. Hello, Jonas. Hello. - How's your training? {\i1}Injected.{\i} - Fine. I am concerned about the receiver. Many years ago there was an incident. What kind of incident? Living alone, in a building on the edge, can isolate a person. I'm concerned that the receiver is... Becoming reckless. Are you being properly prepared? I think so. - You're focused? Perhaps you're spending too much time with friends from your childhood. {\i1}I'm focused.{\i} Jonas, what do you and the receiver actually do? My rules say I'm not allowed to share. She is the chief elder. Jonas, she only wants to help. You're right. {\i1}But you can't tell the receiver I told you.{\i} You have my word. {\i1}We sit in chairs and don't talk all day long.{\i} {\i1}And when the time is up, I come back here.{\i} {\i1}And in the morning I do it all again.{\i} {\i1}I apologize, but I am late.{\i} Your apology is accepted. Good bye, mother. {\i1}Injected.{\i} {\i1}He's not usually like this.{\i} I'm surprised you're not more worried about him. Were he my responsibility, I would be. {\i1}We've been told the chief elder knew everything.{\i} {\i1}Things nobody else did.{\i} {\i1}But I had learned that knowing what something is{\i} {\i1}is not the same as knowing how something feels.{\i} You could be the very best. The last one at the top of the mountain, gasping for air, having survived, and be alone. Be curious. {\i1}I got lost.{\i} {\i1}The good kind of lost.{\i} {\i1}I saw sights and sounds I had no words to describe.{\i} {\i1}Faces with flesh of all different colors.{\i} {\i1}I felt so alive.{\i} {\i1}This was forbidden.{\i} {\i1}I didn't know what to think, what to believe.{\i} {\i1}"Have faith", the giver told me.{\i} {\i1}He said, "faith, "that was seeing beyond".{\i} {\i1}He compared it to the wind:{\i} {\i1}Something felt but not seen.{\i} Don't accept what is the truth just because it's coming from someone you respect. I feel completely stupid. I have a weird feeling. - This is weird. Tingles in your hands. - Yes. Memories are not just about the past. They determine our future. You can change things. You can make things better. {\i1}It was life.{\i} {\i1}It just seemed more complete.{\i} {\i1}The more I experienced,{\i} {\i1}the more I wanted.{\i} Once there were other living things. But unlike us, they knew who their mothers and fathers were. They had joy and they had pain. I can't prepare you for what's gonna... You don't need to warn me every single time. No, Jonas, you don't understand. There was tremendous cruelty. Giver, I'm not a kid anymore. Show me. That's 250,000$ of ivory. Come on. Come on! Got him. - Again. {\i1}No! Stop!{\i} {\i1}Stop!{\i} Stop. Gabe. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Here, Gabe. Gabe, if I tell you a secret, you promise not to tell anyone? I'll take that as a "yes." This comfort object, is not a hippo. It's an elephant. And once, it was real. And it was beautiful. Hey. Hey. {\i1}Citizens are reminded,{\i} {\i1}that sleep period comencs in 15 minutes.{\i} {\i1}Thank you.{\i} It was like a memory but Fiona was there. You had a dream. A what? - A dream. A combination of reality, fantasy, emotions and what you had for dinner. You stopped taking your injections, haven't you? The emotion was so strong and at the wedding... Everyone all together, laughing and dancing... The old with the young. The bride and the groom. There was something there... But different of what we have. Yes. We don't have that anymore. What do you mean by that? Well, I'm talking about what you feel for someone else. And the mind can't explain it and you-- you can't make it go away. What is it? Love. It's called "love." Love. Oh, hi. - Hi. So, what's new? What's new with you? - What's ever new? Why are you being weird? - I'm not. I'm just... I'm just... Go on to the hippo game. Hold on. Father, do you love me? Jonas, precision of language, please. What does "love" mean? I got him, lily. Jonas used a word so antiquated that it no longer has any application, okay? If you asking... - Okay. ...if you enjoy me, the answer is certainly yes. Or do mother and I take pride in your accomplishments, well, of course we do. Do you understand? Yes. I think I finally do. Hey! Hey, Gabe. I love you, Gabriel. Giver, you were right. I asked my family about love. Robbie, wake up! Giver! They're in the trees. They're in the trees, Robbie! Get down! Get down! Robbie, get down! - Robbie, get down! Stay down. I can't see them, man! 'Cause they're in the trees. Stay down! {\i1}- I don't understand,{\i} {\i1}is he casualty?{\i} - Medic! {\i1}They're everywhere!{\i} {\i1}Taking heavy fire.{\i} {\i1}Woman in ten. In the trees.{\i} Robbie. Robbie. Wake up. {\i1}- They're keep firing at us!{\i} {\i1}She is in the trees.{\i} {\i1}Stay down!{\i} Jonas. What...? I'm sorry, Jonas. - How did people do that?! I-- I didn't mean for you to receive that. Not for years. Don't-- don't let this turn you away. I'm not strong enough. Of course, not yet. But Jonas, this is what we need to know so we can advise. I can't. I'm sorry. I just can't. Jonas. Jonas! Jonas. Come back. Please. Come back inside. Let me explain it. When you see something like that... There's no explanation. Rosemary, promise me you'll come back tomorrow. {\i1}Rosemary. Promise me.{\i} Hey, Jonas. Come on. You're just in time. {\i1}I didn't ever wanna go back.{\i} {\i1}I didn't want the wisdom.{\i} {\i1}Didn't want the pain.{\i} {\i1}I wanted my childhood again.{\i} {\i1}Scrape knees in ball games.{\i} - Jonas? {\i1}Back then we'd played war...{\i} {\i1}But war was real.{\i} {\i1}The elders understood that.{\i} {\i1}They erased it from our world.{\i} {\i1}Maybe they were right.{\i} Could you watch over Harry for me? - Of course. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. I know you. You do, do you? - Yes. What do you think would happen if you skip your morning injection? Huh? - If you skipped it? Then the sensor would blink and remind me that I forgot it. No, I don't mean if you forgot, I mean... What do you think would happen if you chose not to be injected? Jonas, I... I thought something was wrong. There is something wrong. Everything is wrong. I quit. Fiona, I'm done being the receiver. Tomorrow morning, skip your injection. What, you quit? Prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple. No, you can't quit. If you quit your position, you get sent to elsewhere. When you leave in the morning, put the apple over the sensor. It'll find your blood and think it's your hand. Stop, you are scaring me. Fiona, I need you to do this. I need you to feel what I knows. - Jonas. An apple wouldn't even work. I've been doing it for a month and it's worked every single time. Don't quit. You can't leave. I don't think I can go back to that place. You will, if you want me to do this. Okay. Fine. But tomorrow after work, meet me at the triangle. {\i1}I wanted to share it with her.{\i} {\i1}Not all of it. The good things.{\i} {\i1}Was I wrong to want that?{\i} {\i1}I thought about her now, all the time.{\i} {\i1}Hello?{\i} {\i1}I have something to show you.{\i} Come here. Who are you? Come over and try this. Me? - Me? Yeah. I wanna teach you. You've come back. Where did you learn that? - From the memory you gave me. And you can just play it? - Mm-hmm. That's beautiful. Who's that? - Thanks. I'll show you. - This... Is Rosemary. The previous receiver. See? - She's the one they all talk about. She no longer exist. Except here. And in my memories. She was in training only two short months. Watch how my finger is moving. Little like you. She wanted to experience... Well, everything. I only gave her pleasant, beautiful memories. She fought me. Don't protect me. - No! Don't show me a map and then not give me all the memories. I thought we were gonna help. We will, but we must move slow. - Show it to me. You gave her war? I gave her the memory of the child. A child taken from her mother. I gave her loss too soon. You're gonna get the hang of this. The light went from her eyes. The next morning, without telling me, she went to the chief elder and asked to be released. So she was released and now lives in elsewhere. {\i1}Yes, receiver.{\i} I would like to see this morning's release. {\i1}Thank you for your instructions.{\i} {\i1}There, there.{\i} - That's my father. {\i1}This one is heavier.{\i} More twins. Great. - Watch. {\i1}Oh, good.{\i} {\i1}For a moment I thought they'd be exactly the same.{\i} {\i1}Here we go. - Then we'd have a problem.{\i} {\i1}Okay. - Thank you dinah. - Okay.{\i} {\i1}Hey, kid. Yes, yes, yes.{\i} {\i1}Only one unit less.{\i} {\i1}Oh... I know it hurts. I know. I know.{\i} {\i1}But I have to use a vein{\i} {\i1}and the ones in your arms are too teeny-weeny.{\i} {\i1}Done. That wasn't so bad, was it?{\i} That's death. He doesn't know what he's doing. Doesn't know what he's doing?! He killed him. - But he doesn't know what it means. Just like you did. Neither did Rosemary. How can he not see the baby isn't moving? Doesn't that tell him that something is wrong? The young and the old are killed. You're friend, Fiona, she will soon be trained to release as well. That's a lie. She'd never do that. If Fiona understood... We are the only ones who understand it. Then it's our fault. You and me and all the receivers, back and back and back and back and back. There has to be a way to show them. To give them the memory so they can understand. Yes. - Because if you can't feel, what's the point? But what can you do? Did it work? I don't know how long it takes for the injections to leave you, but everyday it was long enough... - Why did I do this, Jonas? On the walk here I was thinking of how I would scold you, how I would say, "oh, it's fine for you to break the rules because you're chosen," when I thought about telling you... I just, I... I began to think about you. Is this okay? Do you feel anything? It feels... - Fiona, what do you feel? I don't know. I don't have the words to describe it. Warm? Does it feel warm? Warm? - Does it feel... nice? No, umm... I'm on night shift. I need... I don't feel right, Jonas. I need to go and get my injection. I need to go to work. What was that? Fiona, there is more. So much more. {\i1}I remembered it now.{\i} {\i1}I had dreamed of her when I was younger.{\i} {\i1}I told my parents.{\i} {\i1}"It was hysterics," they said,{\i} {\i1}"everyone had them.{\i} {\i1}"Medication would stop them.{\i} {\i1}"Nothing that couldn't be fixed."{\i} Precision of language. And teacher said, "that's right, lily!" Very good. Jonas, just in time for feelings. Lily was telling us how she... - Where is Gabe? Uncertain was returned to the nurturing center. What happened? He failed his test to maturity. Again. I couldn't ask for another extension, so I'll have to release him to elsewhere. Release him? Well, we certainly give it our best try, didn't we? But he's family. Precision of language, please. Sit down. Eat with us. I just need to rest for a while. {\i1}I hadn't been wrong. This was wrong.{\i} {\i1}They hadn't eliminated murder.{\i} {\i1}They brought it home.{\i} {\i1}They just called it by a different name.{\i} {\i1}Father, he didn't know any better.{\i} {\i1}I did.{\i} Asher. Jonas, what are you doing? It's against the rules to leave your community this late. Asher, there's something that I have to do, that is right, but it's sort of against the rules. If it's the right thing to do, how can it be against the rules? There are things that I've learned that you don't know, that you can't know, not because it's your fault... - Jonas, you need to go back to your family unit. But that's the point. It isn't my family. And neither is yours. Asher, I gotta go. - Jonas. Listen. - Get out of my way. Jonas, please stop! - What are you...? Giver! Giver, wake up. I'd have to be sleeping to wake up. Something can be done. Something can be done! - What are you proposing? All the memories back and back and back can be returned. I need to leave the community. I need to find the boundary of memory. And then? - And then cross it. No more discussions, giver. - All right, slowly. Gabe is in danger. Slowly. - I can't wait anymore. Something must be done. If you had that map, then why didn't you try to leave? I was waiting for someone like you. You are the reason we have a chance. So, the plan will be for you to go and for me to stay. If you did cross this boundary, and if the memories are set free, all of the pain that you've felt, all the... Confusion, the chaos, it will all return. So you'd stay to help them? - Yes. And for my daughter. It's what she would have wanted. Your daughter? - Rosemary. Now, your friend, if he truely saw the triangle of rocks... Bring up Jonas's activity for the past year as well. So Asher came directly to you. Yes. - What was Jonas's disposition at evening meal? Dissatisfied, anxious, indignant. Set up a communication with the receiver of memory. We're not permitted to see into the receiver's residence. We can only transmit. Well, then, we shall only transmit. If you go, head towards the triangle, away from the other communities. That will lead to the boundary of memory. {\i1}Please stand by for a transmission.{\i} I apologize for the intrusion. I accept your apology. We have a problem. Receiver in training is missing and he physically attacked his friend Asher. He did? That serious? Do you know where Jonas is? I do not. Well, thank you very much for... Helping us to narrow down the possibilities. {\i1}I will contact you if he comes here.{\i} Only if it's not an imposition. Thank you. He's lying. Talk. - They're going to kill Gabe. I'm leaving. I'm leaving tonight and I'm going to take him with me. No, Jonas, not yet. You're not ready. When they decided to kill Gabe, they decided I was ready. I like this map. Don't mess it up. I'll be wanting it back. You donç¨š mind if I accelerate your training a bit, do you? You'd think for someone who is the keeper of emotions that iĺŁ‡ be better at... Well, I love you, Jonas. Yeah. There it is. You have the courage, let me give you the strength. Can I just... {\i1}Attention all community residents.{\i} {\i1}The receiver in training has been reported missing from his dwelling.{\i} {\i1}Please, be alert.{\i} {\i1}You may be in danger.{\i} Group one will start from the edge and look inward. Then group two from the center, out. No, like this. {\i1}Welcome to the nurturing center.{\i} Shall I convene the others? - Yes. Jonas, I heard an alert. What's going on? Hey, where is Gabe? Is he here? Is he in one of these? - If he's back then he'd be with the uncertains, on the restricted floor. Show me where. Fiona, please. They're downstairs. Come on. {\i1}Jonas was chosen for the most important position in our community.{\i} He was asked if he were strong enough. It turns out he was not. {\i1}Instead, he is... A rebel{\i} {\i1}who must be stopped by you.{\i} {\i1}When you find him,{\i} take him. Gabe is in danger. - Jonas, he's fine. I'll show you. No, he's not fine. He should be here. Fiona, I'm leaving, tonight. Leaving? What do you mean? I'm taking Gabe. We're leaving the community. I want you to come with us. Hey. Hey. Huh. Shh-shh-shh. {\i1}I don't have the words to describe it.{\i} {\i1}Fiona, there is more. So much more.{\i} What are they doing? {\i1}Fiona, what do you feel? - I don't have the words to describe it.{\i} {\i1}Attention, nurturers.{\i} {\i1}Please secure your workarea,{\i} {\i1}and immediately report to the new-born nursery{\i} {\i1}to allow for a security search procedure.{\i} {\i1}Promptly report all sightings to the nearest security kiosk.{\i} {\i1}Thank you.{\i} Fiona, we gotta go now. You and me, and Gabe. Jonas, I can't. What about my family unit, the other new children? I can't leave them. This is the only way. This is the only way to make everything okay. I can't go. When I'll get there, you'll understand. I'll come back for you. - Jonas. Come back. Now. Go, Jonas. Please, stop! {\i1}Subject lost to the edge.{\i} {\i1}Search terminated.{\i} And that was why he was out so late. He seemed... angry. I didn't understand why, but I wanted to help him. {\i1}He hit me,{\i} {\i1}and at first...{\i} I can tell why you've been acting this way. Your injection levels are extremely low. I can correct this. Friends forever, right? And then we will address what's happened. {\i1}When I went over the edge, we shouldn't have made it.{\i} {\i1}This was a miracle.{\i} {\i1}The giver had talked about them.{\i} {\i1}He told me I can draw strength from the memories.{\i} {\i1}I knew, by giving them to Gabe,{\i} {\i1}i could protect him.{\i} {\i1}Prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple.{\i} {\i1}When you leave in the morning, put the apple over the sensor.{\i} {\i1}I've been doing it for a month and it worked every single time.{\i} What has he taught you?! {\i1}...not a home.{\i} {\i1}This is the only way. This is the only way to make everything okay.{\i} {\i1}Gabe is in danger.{\i} {\i1}What they're gonna do to him is really bad.{\i} {\i1}I want you to come with us.{\i} {\i1}When I'll get there you'll understand.{\i} {\i1}I'll come back for you.{\i} Yes. Careful. Careful. I apologize for failing again. I don't think you failed. I think you succeeded with your plan. Ever since the girl was released you haven't been the same. I genuinely hoped Jonas would help you. You'd have a fresh start, the two of you would work together. Which it seems you have. We will find Jonas. {\i1}Jonas, our receiver of memory,{\i} {\i1}lost to the edge.{\i} Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. How do they know Jonas is gone? We must not say his name anymore. I will. You have to be quiet now, lily. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. And the hippo was really an elephant. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. Jonas. What I'm about to tell you, you must never repeat to anyone. I don't believe Jonas is lost. But the ceremony of loss... Charade. I don't expect you to understand, but you must know that Jonas has become dangerous. He must be stopped. He must not get beyond the triangle of rocks. What do you want me to do? You know Jonas. I want you to find him. And then I want you to lose him. POWER DEPLETED Jonas? What are you doing? Asher, please, let us go. I can't. I'm supposed to... - To what? To lose you. Asher, if you are my friend, if you ever were my friend, can you please somehow trust me? Trust me now. CARGO RELEASING - I do trust you, Jonas. Come on, please. Jonas? You found him. I did. For the good of all of us, I beg you, finish this. It's finished. Hey. It's okay. {\i1}Nothing the giver had shown me{\i} {\i1}had prepared me for the voices in my head.{\i} {\i1}Screaming at me to stop.{\i} {\i1}But I knew Fiona will be punished for helping me.{\i} {\i1}Asher, for letting me go.{\i} {\i1}The only way to help them,{\i} {\i1}to keep them alive,{\i} {\i1}was to get to the boundary.{\i} {\i1}If it even existed.{\i} {\i1}I strengthen Gabe, with memories of having enough{\i} {\i1}and knowing joy.{\i} {\i1}It was the memory of Fiona that kept me going.{\i} Fiona? I've taken care of everything. We've arranged for your release. There'll be a nice ceremony. Now, you get some rest. I felt things. - What? I know that there's something more. - Fiona... Something missing from our lives. No. Not missing. Something that has been stolen from me and from you. I don't know what it is exactly, but Jonas does. I have felt things and they were warm. And they were nice. And they were beautiful. I have felt things. I have felt things. I have felt things. Where is the tower, Gabe? The tower should be here. You can stop this. Stop what? If you don't want to see it, sit down with the other elders, and close your eyes. {\i1}Ceremony of release to elsewhere.{\i} Hello, Fiona. Are you uncomfortable? I'm not uncomfortable. I'm afraid. You don't have to be afraid. You know me. {\i1}I'll be very gentle.{\i} {\i1}I promise.{\i} {\i1}Okay?{\i} Her name was Rosemary. She was my daughter. I loved her. Precision of language. I could not be more precise. Do you know what that's like? To love someone? I do. {\i1}I've cried, I've...{\i} {\i1}Felt her sorrow.{\i} {\i1}I've sung, danced.{\i} I felt real joy. Then you should know better than anyone. You have seen children starve. - Yes. You've seen people stare at each other necks, just for the view. You know what it feels like when men blow each other up... - Yes. Over a simple line in the sand. - I do, I do. But... - And yet... And yet you and Jonas want to {\i1}open that door again.{\i} Bring all that back. If you could only see the possibilities of love. - Why? Of love. That's just... - With love comes faith, comes hope. Love is just passion that can turn. It turns into contempt and murder. - We can do better. We could choose better. People are weak. People are selfish. When people have a freedom to choose, they choose wrong. Every single time. It's a sled. {\i1}Loss and pain.{\i} Music, joy. The raw impossible beautiful feeling of love. Your son, he felt that. That girl, she has felt it. - That's enough. We are living a life of shadows. Of echoes. Of fate. Distant whispers of what once made us reals. Excuse me for one second, Fiona. I have-- - we must continue. {\i1}I wish I had been there when the memories returned.{\i} {\i1}They were the truth.{\i} {\i1}The elders and their rules were the lie.{\i} {\i1}So I do not apologize.{\i} {\i1}I knew Fiona was safe.{\i} {\i1}That I'd see her again.{\i} {\i1}And that I held a future there in my arms.{\i} {\i1}The giver had led us here.{\i} {\i1}To this house.{\i} {\i1}It was real.{\i} {\i1}From far behind me, from the place I had left,{\i} {\i1}i thought I heard music, too.{\i} {\i1}Perhaps it was only an echo.{\i} {\i1}But it was enough.{\i} {\i1}It will lead us all home.{\i} _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ {\i1}Transcript by hearing by Pippo{\i}
