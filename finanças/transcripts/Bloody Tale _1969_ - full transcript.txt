Go away! More to the right, right. Not yet. Alright. Stop! Commandant, Captain Theobald Wagner reporting. Of 11.000 workers in the military engineering department today only these showed up.

For those workers who didn't show up any employment in town is to be prohibited. Food handouts are to be stopped. Keep them assembled. Report all incidents. - Yes, Herr Kommandant! They will come when they're hungry. They will plead. What's that mate? Hitler attacked the Russians and your Mara is getting married? No, we're messing with Hitler. We won't work anymore. He'll see how we mess around! We declared war to them! Better a war than the pact, better a war than the pact! Come on, shout that. - Germans are coming! Germans are coming!

There are some. Jump down! Zoki, jump, faster! Oh my dear mother, I died! Jump, quickly! Jump! Follow me. Stop. Where is Lotar? He won't stand up. Dead. He's dead. - How can he be dead when he wasn't sick? He stopped breathing. Bullet gets you down for sure. Should we put him in the ground? Soil will exctract the sickness. - No use, he's dead.

Is it gold? - do yuo know what's in there? New suits. - I know, a cow is in there! Lift! - What did you see? - Let's go. Little more, little more. Watch your feet. Close the door. What is this? - Silence! Dear mother! A dead man! - Don't move! - It's moving! Stop, don't go to the street! Are you crazy, the Germans are there! Come back, they'll beat you! Do you hear, don't go to the street, the Germans are there! Everybody inside, come on, hurry! Sova, Kale, Bat, inside, quick! Faster! Germans would've hanged us for this? - Is he really dead? He's dead, stiff cold! Get in here, now! And you, Kale, you ran like a woman! Come on! Get in, quickly! No one leaves this place without my command, do you understand? Piljak, is he dead or alive? - A dead man. No one say a word. Piljak, I'll give you my share. I need this badge! - Leave that! Look how pretty boots he have. - Boots are mine! - I saw them first. - Quiet. It seems he's a General. - General is valuable, dead or alive. Heil! - Heil! Don't joke around, if anyone asks, your grandfather died, we're walking with him, that's the custom. What's his name? - Devla. No, it's Dobrosav! - If you hit me again I'll throw away this cross! Mile, they've brough it! - Where are they? - They're comming! Prcko, kick Misko out. Such a big pig! We'll have sausages until the end of the war! Give something extra in money. - No way, you're getting General's uniform, and coffin too. No way! This coffin is your size! - Shut up, God forbid! Where are the boots? - He didn't have them. - General without the boots? Give me the boots! Faster! - Leave me at least one. - You're so haisty about that! My size. - Is this a stolen stuff. - No, my Misko, I starved for him! You have plenty of meat. Ham, bacon, sausages, and plus fat! My friend, new uniform, new boots, medals, and what about war credits? - We didn't include transport! Alright, let's not jinx, I'm going to war! - Good luck to you then! - Thank you, mate! Let's go, Prcko. If they catch us with this, they'll hang us. Come on, Misko! If only we found Hitler, we'd get an ox for him! Let me treat myself too! Take this. Bila! Bila! Piljak sent you this. You, me, you, me... You! Close your eyes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! You're it! What are they doing? - Making love! Spread out! Left and right! Spread out!

People, rains are comming, workers are waiting, lime gets wet, and what have I done? He doesn't want? - No. - It's not that I don't want to, I can't fool around! Dead. - He's dead. He's dead for lime. - You don't undersand that Bila, it's war, people die. Partisans! Shoot! Piljak! - I'll go. Scram! Look what my dad is doing with partisans. - Run or he'll kill us too. Quickly! Quickly, quickly, hurry up! Should we take him home? - A soldier is buried where he dies. We have to follow the orders. 100 for every dead and 50 for every injured soldier. From Kragujevac? - I don't care from where. The evil doesn't lie in an individual but in all of them. In every town, in the whole country. Last week, Kraljevo was punished, and Kragujevac is next. Does that mean we kill them just because they are Serbs? Or because they aren't Germans. How many? - 10 dead and 27 injured today. Yesterday, 6 dead and 14 injured. In the last three days, 17 dead and 16 injured. Round it up to 8.000. - Why so many more? In case some of the injured die. Look how much I collected. - Look how much money, Piljak! - Get more! Do you have tin, kid? - I'll get it. It's good, I'll wear it for at least three years! Little more, there you go, it's fine. - Run, Germans are gathering all males! Piljak, let's run! Run away from here! Gather the stuff! You drink too, buddy! Radojica's son Dragisa got married! What is this? Let me go! Turn around. Quickly! Shall we go back? Citizens of Kragujevac! By the order of German command, you're gathered here to be given new ID's because of stronger actions of enemies of Serbian people! We warn you to follow our orders, because every dissobediance will be punished most strictly! Piljak! Piljak! Bila, where is Piljak? - He'll get ID too. - Come over here. Close the gate! Get away from there. Let's go. Close it! Dear God, our Lord, help us. God, you see how miserable are we. Save us. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Save our children! Don't leave me alone! The unit is reporting. - Thanks. Soldiers! Our F?hrer bestows on you the honor of avenging the fathers and brothers whose blood was spilled in this country due to the malice of the Serbs. I'm ordering you to punish them. For them, strict rigor means leniency. Hit them as long as you like. Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! Begin! - At your command, General! Begin! - At your command, Major! Begin! - At your command, Captain! Begin! - At your command, Lieutenant! Begin! Who is thirsty? Who wants to wash his face? Who wants do drink water? Let the thirsty ones come out! Enough! Get back!! Rope them in. Form a circle. How old are you, principal Pantelic? - 58. Step forward. - I will if you release the students. Then stay. Up with the rope. Quick! Owl, there's your brother. Captain Marisav Petrovic, we brought 200 Gypsies. - Hold on a minute. Tolmas, tell Major to release the merchants, they are not communists. I'm giving Gypsies insted, 8 for 1. He wants ten. Load them out. Spusti trgovce. Come on, merchants, out. Thank you, brother. Quickly, get down. Come on, hurry. Come on, more. To that group, come on! God bless you. He's not a merchant! Get back! Get in! Get in! This one's still moving. As you can see, principal Pavlovic, I can save you. - If that's true, than I don't need that life. Get over there! Go! Go! Piljak is still not there. - Maybe they'll run out of bullets when it's his turn. - I hope so. Sit down. Sit down! First rank kneels down. Aim! Peter, aim! Peter, are you listening? What's going on? Peter. What should we do? We will ask them nicely to stop. Quick! - Yes, Major! Silence! Orders from command are this. Who wants to go to work in Germany will be spared! Numbers are limited! Go on, move it. Stop! Stop! Bila, there's your father. Brothers, they'll kill us! Run! Get up! Get out of there. Get out, quick! Let's go. Move it. Let me go! Let me go, uncle! Let me go! Kale, Zoki, Piljak! Let me go! - Kneel down. They have seen it all. What do you want us to do with them? They shall clean our boots for now. Why shoot me in the back, damn you? Why grandpa lied to me that it doesn't hurt? It hurts! It hurts! How will we perform the service when we know the names of killed? Let's say all Serbian names, because all of them are among shoted ones. Piljak, Kale, Zoki, Bat, Owl, Dragan, Dule, Lotar, Kurilo, Slonce. THE END Translated by Inglourious @KG
