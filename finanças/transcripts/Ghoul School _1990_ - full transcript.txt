Bogglins. - Hey little faggots, what is this, some sort of girly slumber party? - What's up, Sculley? - [Sculley] Fuck you too. - [Steve] Did you find a job? - Yeah, me and your fuckin' mom are washing windshields on the turnpike. - Funny. - Hey, what'd you fuckin' eat my Droogies for? - They're my Droogies! - Oh, yeah, they're your Droogies? - [Jeff] Yeah. - Well, here you go. Enjoy your fuckin' Droogies, man. - Why are you such an asshole? - Because I like to take after you (chuckles). - Don't quit your day job. - Why don't you faggots get on your way out to school, and go learn the golden rule. - I'm not a faggot! - You are too a faggot. You've always been a faggot and you'll always be a faggot. - Shut the fuck up! Drink up and let's get outta here. - Yeah, why don't you get outta here, man. - Let's go, Steve. - Oh, I'm really fuckin' hurt by your actions, look. - [Steve] Have fun. - I feel like I just made out with you. Mom? You bitch! (birds chirping) (students chattering) - This is Principal Kaplan speaking. I have a few announcements to make before you leave today, and I want everyone to pay close attention. I mean it now. These are important announcements, you know. All right now, I'm sure you all wanna hear the results of last week's Battle of the Bands contest to decide which group will preform this Saturday night at the school dance. Though I question your taste in music, it's your decision. So, the winner is Blood Sucking Ghouls. Blood Sucking Ghouls? They will be performing at the dance tomorrow night. It will begin at 7:30, and everyone is encouraged to attend, and no drinking, I'll be there! If I catch anyone drinking or smoking any pots, they will be expelled on the spot. So, everyone better be on their best behavior. (clears throat) Now that we're on the topic of good behavior. (light rock music) Now, there will be basketball practice in the gym this afternoon. - Jesus, when is this fuckin' jerk off gonna shut up already? I always hated the shithead. - Relax, it'll be a few minutes tops. We'll slip in when the little pukes start coming out. - The little bastards, I'd like to kill them all. - I'll keep the gun for now. We don't need to attract any fuckin' attention. You're sure the shit's in there, right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. I mean, unless that fuckin' shithead janitor's moved it. It should be in the wall somewhere. - Cool, how come you never graduated this shit hole? - Fuckin' jerk off principal that's jerkin' us off over the loudspeaker, he screwed me over. I'd like to rip his fuckin' face off. - Fuck him, after we take down the janitor, you'll have enough money to buy the fuckin' diploma. - (chuckles) Yeah, it'll be easy to steal as this bike, huh? - I think we could all learn a valuable lesson from Mr. Franklin's own life experiences. That's all I have for today. Well, that went well. - I think they got the point. - I hope so. - I wouldn't worry about it. - All right, I'll be in my office.

Listen, I just wanted to thank you for speaking at the school assembly this morning. - Ah, don't mention it. It was my pleasure, Bob. They were great kids. Beautiful kids, every one of them. Great, great kids. Ah, God bless them all. They are such nice people, I mean it. Listen, Bob, but more important, when are we gonna get together now, and work out the details for the next uh, for the next appearance, for the next speech? - How about Monday? - Ah, no, Monday's not a good day for me, because uh, no Monday I've gotta uh, well, I've got lunch. I've got an appointment with Zsa Zsa, yeah, I can't. I don't wanna disappoint Zsa Zsa. I can't make it Monday. - Well, how about uh, this weekend? - Well, my only problem, not, not that it's a problem, but I gotta go to the Club Med on Saturday. Yeah, I promised, and I'm flying to Vegas on, uh, the next day to uh, catch Wayne Newton's act. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm considering putting Wayne Newton on my show, yeah, but we'll work it out. We'll, we'll, you know, it's a, it's a crowded weekend for me, but I'll, I'll work it out, I promise you, yeah. - [Jackie] Excuse me. (knocking on door) Joe, Joe? - Oh, oh, listen, I'm uh, I'm, I'm being approached. I'm being, I'm being attacked. Bob, I'll talk to you later, Bob. I'm sorry, okay bye, Bob. - [Jackie] Hi, hi, Joe, Joe Franklin? - [Joe] Yeah. - [Jackie] Jackie Martling, Jackie The Joke Man. - [Joe] Oh, yeah? - I wanna be on your show. I have great jokes and not too dirty, not too dirty. I mean I have a reputation. I tell dirty jokes. - I, I, I've heard that reputation, yeah, yeah. - Did ya, I, I work all over the place. I have a joke line, 9-2-2-y-5-1-6, you've called it. - Many times. - The jokes aren't too dirty. Well, they're a little dirty, but they don't have dirty words in them. A little girl walks out of the bathroom... - Have you, have you seen my show through the years? - Oh yeah, I watch it every night. Is it still on? - Yeah, I was on last night, I was on last night. - No, listen, I'm kidding. Of course I watch it, and I have jokes that are good without the four letter words. - There are such things? - Yeah, a girl walks out of the bathroom. Her mother's making a cake. She says, Mommy, can I lick the bowl? And her mother says, why don't you just flush it like everybody else (laughing). You know when you know you're really lonely? - When? - You're own tongue starts to feel good in your mouth. (both laugh) - That's good, that's the kind of a joke, no wait. - Well, that's not dirty, there's no four letter... - That's the kind of a joke, Jackie, that can not only close theaters, it'll close cities. - (laughs) Wait, uh, what's that? - I'm only kidding, I give up. - That's a dead Italian, because if he was alive, he'd be going like that (laughs). Ask me how fat she was. - How fat she was? - No, say, how fat was she? - How fat was she? - She was so fat that when she forgot her diaphragm, they used a hubcap. - That is good, right, right. - A guy's in bed with a girl, he says, you're flat and you're tight. She says, get off my back (laughs). - You think that's good for a family type show. I think so, right? - I think it could work. - I think it is. - A couple's in the living room, he says, you're dry tonight. She says, you're licking the rug (laughs). What do you say to a girl with no arms and no legs? - I give up. - Nice tits. I've been a fan of yours ever since I heard that I was auditioning for you (laughs). - A week from Saturday we definitely tape. You're on the panel with a couple of kids named Milton Berle and Henny Youngman, all right? We'll do the changing face of comedy, how's that? - They're gonna steal my jokes. How are a woman's breasts like electric train sets? - I give up. - They're originally intended for the kids, but Pop always ends up playing with them. What do a bleach blond and a 747 have in common? - Uh. - They both got a black box (laughs). I'm pretty good, pretty good. Did you hear about the guy who couldn't come? We had to go get him (laughs). - Listen, speaking, speaking about coming, I wanna thank you... - You know how. - I wanna thank you for coming. - Just, just one more. - All right. - You know your boss is like a diaper? - How? - He's always on your ass, and he's usually full of shit (laughs). - Listen, all right, one more, one more, then I'll uh, then I'll give you my, my uh, informed appraisal, my educated assessment. - They'd be going nuts. I can hear 'em, listen, I can hear 'em. - Listen, Jackie, Jackie, I wanna, I wanna tell you something. I wanna tell you something. That your future is secure. - Yeah? - Yes, but don't quit your day job. - I got a few more here. - You will go overnight from obscurity to total oblivion. - Where. - One, one more. - Where would you find a turtle with no legs? - I give up. - Right where you left him (laughs). - (chuckles) Have a good, have a good evening. - It's because he couldn't get, because he couldn't get anywhere. - You are the greatest, you're the greatest. - You know why you should never drink diet soda while you're having oral sex? - Why? - Because then you have two aftertastes you gotta get rid of (laughs). - [Joe] Have fun, have fun. - Joe, I've got millions of these. I'll call you with some more if you want me to call you. - Promise, please. - [Jackie] I can call you back, because I know I've got lots of great stuff here. I wanna do you show. - [Secretary] Carol Nestling. - Hello? - [Janitor] No, no, what're you doing? (screams) Help me! (gun firing) - Yell all you want! No one's gonna hear you down here! Now, tell me where it is while you still can! - Yeah, tell him where it is before we blow your fuckin' brains out - Fuck you! - Fuck this, are you sure it's here? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. It's in the wall somewhere. He's had that here for years, the bastard. - Watch him, I'll find it myself! (janitor screams) - You find it? - I can't see a fuckin' thing. Wait a minute. (janitor screams) - Where the fuck is it? (gun firing) (suspenseful music) I can't see a fuckin' thing. - Cool out. What the fuck? - What is this place? - Beats the shit outta me. - Hey, what do these do? - No! (suspenseful music) Shit. (suspenseful music) (thugs choking and coughing) (suspenseful music) (hard rock music) - Come on, man, do you got the tape or not? - Relax, I got it. Crazy Tommy told me it was awesome too. - Now, all you have to do is find the God damn thing. - So, is your old man getting you a gun for your birthday or what? - I don't know. Shit, he must be. We've been going to the firing range every weekend for two months now. I'm getting pretty good. What the fuck, man, where is it? - It's movie time. - Cool, let's go up to the AV room. I wanna see some good gore. - The AV room? Are you sure? We could get busted. If Kaplan catches us. - That old bastard won't catch us. Don't worry about it. Besides, have I ever gotten us busted? - [Jeff] No. - Bolt. - Okay, but I hope we don't get in trouble. - Trust me. - I love you. - [Mike] Yeah, me too, babe. - Do you want your history notebook? - [Mike] No, I don't need it. - What're we gonna do tonight? - Well, I thought we'd go over Danny's later. - [Mary] Danny's again? - Yeah. - Well, I thought we'd spend some time alone tonight, and not go out with the guys. - We are gonna spend some time alone together. - When? - Right now. - Oh, Mike, not here. - Come on. (boy whistling) (suspenseful music) (thugs coughing and groaning) - What the fuck happened? - I don't know. You pressed the fuckin' button. - I don't feel so good. I gotta go to the hospital. - What the fuck are we gonna tell them, huh? Let's get the fuck outta here before the cops come. - He's getting his time down real good. - He certainly is. We should do really well tonight. - Well, we're going to do better than just well. We're gonna kick their butts. - (laughs) You better not let them hear you talk like that. They might actually think we're human. (swim coaches laughing) (swim team growling) - Oh, my God! - I think they're putting a little bit too much chlorine in the pool. (suspenseful music) (swim coaches screaming) - Let me up, no! (female coach screaming) (suspenseful music) (male coach screaming) (suspenseful music) (female coach screaming) (suspenseful music) (Blade screaming) (hard rock music) - [Blade] One, two, three, hit it! (hard rock music) (audience cheering and applauding) - Yeah! That was fan-fuckin'-tastic, man. We're gonna play our fuckin' brains out tomorrow night. - Fuckin' aright, man. Listen, we'll take a break. We'll come back and practice to close the set, okay? - What's wrong with Roxanne? - Nothing, everything's good. It's cool, really, really. (light piano music) What the fuck is wrong with you? - What the fuck are we doin' here? - What do you mean? - This place, that's what I mean. - It's a great gig. The kids will love us. - I thought all the hard work was so that we could play bigger places, not fuckin' high schools. - Listen Rox, I've been doin' this for awhile, and these so-called fuckin' high schools is where it all starts. Besides, these kids, if they really like us, and really get into our music, we'll have the whole graduating class full of Blood Sucking Ghoul fans in just a few months. - Well, I hope so, because we're definitely not making any money on this deal. - Don't worry about it, Roxanne. - Listen, Blade, you know I think you're the best God damn lead singer in New York, but we've gotta make a change. - What kind of change? - I think I should start managing the band. Don't give me that look. We've talked about this before, and you know it's the best thing. You have a big heart, but you don't have a head for business and strategy and I do. - Yeah, and what're the guys gonna think when I tell them all this? - They'll be thanking you when you start playing big clubs and get a record contract. - Oh, and you think you can do all that? - Yeah, I think I can. I'm pretty tough when I have to be. - Let me think about it, and I'll tell you in the morning. - Okay, you fucker, think hard. - Don't get me started, don't get me started. Hold that thought though. Everybody up, let's go, let's practice the next set. (light piano music) - [Jeff] That's fuckin' beautiful! - [Steve] This is great! - I told you crazy Tony really knows his gore. - [Steve] How did he get this? It's not even out yet. - It's a bootleg. - [Steve] I gotta get a copy. - [Both] Oh, shit! - Look at that. I didn't know that was physically possible. - They're dead remember? (zombies groaning) - Did you hear something? - What? - Nothing, I guess. (hard rock music) (whistle blowing) - Okay, listen up. Before we get started with the layup drills, I have something to say to you girls. Your performance Monday night against Aquinas High was pathetic. You should've kicked their butts. You're better than they are. We are never gonna make to the states playing the way we did on Monday. To tell you the truth, I almost wish I was home watching the Giants game. - We wish you were home too, Coach. - Now, I wanna see one hell of a practice today, and we're gonna go an extra hour just to make sure we're ready for Pope John. You're all gonna have to start working a lot harder around here, if you wanna keep chalking up the wins and impressing the babes. - Yo, Coach. - What, Stewart? - Don't you think it's gonna be a little hard with only five players on the team? - Yeah, we gotta play the whole game now. - Those other guys didn't wanna listen to me. I'm in charge here. You five will just have to suck it up. Okay, let's get to it. Come on, O'Rawe, move your ass. (hard rock music) - I'm leaving now, Lois. Have a nice weekend. - Oh, wait, I'll walk out with you. I'm done anyway. - Okay, I'll tell Kaplan we're leaving. - Okay. - I finished the last of the alumni letters. - [Kaplan] Oh, good. - Lois and I are leaving now. - Drive safely, I'll see you tomorrow night. Oh, how is the work on the set for the play coming along? - Good, they're working on the sets backstage in the auditorium everyday. Except tonight and tomorrow, of course, because of the dance. - Well, hopefully it won't get to rowdy. - Well, let's hope for the best. Goodnight now, sir. - Goodnight, Miss Owen. Blood Sucking Ghouls. Whatever happened to romance and slow dancing? Now all they wanna do is grunt, groan, and slam dance. - Don't worry, I'm coming. - Relax, I'm in no hurry to get home. - Thank God it's Friday. - Are you kidding? Now I have to spend the next 48 hours with my kids. (Miss Owen laughing) (hard rock music) That's the band for tomorrow night's dance. - I know, they sound good. - You like that stuff, huh? - Sure, you mean you don't like rock and roll, Lois? - I like rock and roll all right, but that's a little bit too loud for me. - [Miss Owen] Well, I think I'm gonna go check it out for a little awhile. - Not me, I have to get home and make dinner, and see what my little darlings have destroyed today. - Sounds like fun. - It's more like Nightmare on Elm Street. - Well, I'll see you on Monday then. - Yeah, have a good weekend. - Thanks, you too. - Bye. - I gotta take a leak. Pause the movie until I get back. - Hurry up. - Relax, I'll just be a few minutes. (girl grunting and gurgling) Oh, shit! (suspenseful music) (girl growling) - (sighs) Where the hell is he? Screw this, I'm watching it. I'll tell him what he missed. (boy growling) (suspenseful music) Shit, he's missing the best part. (swimmers growling) God damn it, Jeff. This really pisses me off. What the hell? What the fuck is going on? - They're coming. - Who's coming. - The swim team. - So, what do they want with you? - I think they wanna eat me. - (chuckles) Funny. - I'm serious, these monsters attacked me. One was eating a leg. - A leg? - Yeah, I think it was Miss Lloyd. - Bullshit. (suspenseful music) (swim team growling) Holy shit. - That's them. - The swim team? - I think they're putting too much chlorine in the pool. - Come on! (swim team growling) (mysterious music) - [Woman] Die copper. (ghoul grunting and growling) (electricity crackling) (suspenseful music) (Jeff grunts) - Wait a minute. It's time for a fire drill. (girl growling) (fire extinguisher thuds) (girl screaming) - This is serious. - No shit. - Isn't that Mary Beth Allen? - Yup. - This kind of shit just doesn't happen around here. - This kind of shit doesn't happen anywhere. - What're we gonna do? - We get help fast. First I wanna check out the pool, come on. (hard rock music) (moves into dramatic music) - I think the swim team is gonna forfeit tonight. - This is one very fucked up nightmare. - What're we gonna do now? - We get help fast. - Okay. (ball thudding) - Go get it, O'Rawe. - Me, Heidinger threw it. - I don't wanna hear it. Just use the other one for now. Come on, O'Rawe, go get it. (ball thudding) - Oh, man, I can't see shit in here. (ball thudding) - Where the hell is that kid? O'Rawe, get over here. Heidinger, get that ball. - Oh, Bob, uh, this is Joe. I'll tell ya, Bob, I don't uh, I don't feel so good. That's why I called ya. I want ya to know I don't feel so hot right now. What, what, what might've been in that water? - Just water, Joe. We bottled it ourselves. There's a natural spring in the boiler room. - Bob, it occurs to me, I ran into these two kids named Steve and Jeff, yeah, Steve and Jeff. Do you think they might've put something into that water? I'm a little bit uh, curious about that, yeah. - Those two guys, Steve and Jeff, they've been a pain in my ass all year. - Well, you could really maybe do me one very definite, specific favor, and check out what was in that water, because I'll tell ya a funny thing, I feel funny. Yeah, Bob, do check it out for me, very important. - Okay, take care, bye Joe. - Uh, I'm feeling very, very peculiar, very, very something. - Mr. Kaplan, sir, we gotta call the police. - Yeah, and I'd cancel the swim meet if I was you. - Just hold it right there. Who do you think you are barging in here without knocking like that? You just bought yourself a couple of detentions. - You don't understand, sir. We've got a real horror story on our hands. - [Kaplan] A horror story? - That's right, sir. Mary Beth Allen ate Miss Lloyd's leg, and we had to stick an ax in her chest. - What the hell are you talking about? Are you on drugs, son? - Listen to me. There are these things in the school killing people and eating them. - And just what are these things? - The swim team. - The swim team? - Yeah, the swim team. - Get out of my office right now. - We're not fuckin' around here, God damn it. We need to get help. We gotta call the cops. - Are you totally insane? You barging in my office telling me some crazy stories about things eating people, and you expect to use my phone? - It's an emergency. - Emergency, your grade point averages are an emergency, you two horror freaks. The whole horror world should be heavily censored. It's brainwashing you into making up and believing these incredible stories. If you gore fanatics thought like the majority of normal people, there would be a lot less problems in this world today. - Screw this. - [Kaplan] Put that phone down right now, young man. - It's dead. - You're both suspended as of now. - Suspended? - [Kaplan] Now get out of here before I decide to expel you both. - Expelled? - You can't expel us, we quit. - Come on, let's get outta here. - I'll expect you both in my office first thing Monday morning. - Asshole. - Hey, I gotta get the tape. - Are you nuts? We gotta get outta here and get help. Those things will kill ya. - Crazy Tommy will kill me if I don't bring that tape back. - Fuck it, okay, but after that we're getting outta here. What the fuck happened here? - Oh, God, we're dead now for sure. - Oh, shit. - Who would do that? - It doesn't matter. We'll get blamed for it anyway. - It was the fuckin' swim team I bet. - Really, there are swimmers out there eating people's fuckin' flesh. You really think anybody's gonna give a shit about a God damn TV? - No, I guess not. - Okay then, hurry up and get the tape, and turn the other one off. - It's stuck. - Forget it, let's bolt. (light guitar music) (swim team growling) (Mary screaming) (suspenseful music) - Jesus Christ! (suspenseful music) Oh, my God! - It's too late, he's fucked. We can't help him. It'll only get us killed too. Come on, let's get the fuck outta here. (suspenseful music) - Wait a minute. - What? - We can't leave yet. - Are you fuckin' crazy? We're outta here. - Those things are still in there. - So, let's go get some help. - By the time it gets back here, they're be dead. We have to warn them. We have to get them out. - Who, get who out? I hope you don't mean Kaplan. - No, not him, the band, man, the band. - The band, shit. Okay, we'll go back. They're in the auditorium, right? - Yeah. - Oh man, I got a bad feeling about this. - Watch how it's done, homo. - Yeah, your momma shows me how it's done. - I'm gonna kick your ass, mother fucker. - Your mother kicks my ass every Saturday night. - [Coach] Just shoot it, Heidinger. - Go get it, O'Rawe. - Me? - And I don't wanna see any more of this throwing the basketball around the gym shit either. Let's get back to it. (ball thudding) The kid is giving me a headache. (suspenseful music) (ball thuds) (suspenseful music) - Coach, take a look at this. (ghoul growling) - Coach, over there too. (suspenseful music) - Jesus Christ, who are these guys? - What now, Coach? (ghouls growling) ♪ Always falling outta bed ♪ Turn on the TV set (ghoul growling) ♪ Gonna get my gun ♪ Violence ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence - Hey! Where the hell are you guys going? Where's the rest of the team? - Get lost, punk. - They're all dead. It was horrible. These monsters, they killed Heidinger. Ripped O'Rawe's head off. They killed everybody. What are they? - The swim team. - [Coach] What? - The fuckin' swim team. Somehow they changed into these things, these ghouls, and they're eating people. - What a minute. Those guys that attacked us were no swimmers. - Jesus, it's spreading. - Who cares, let's get the hell outta here now. - No, we gotta get the band first. - The band? - The Blood Sucking Ghouls. They're in the auditorium. - They're a bunch of freaks, come on. Are you guys crazy? Those things aren't human. We can't fight them. - We're not gonna fight, not if we can avoid it. - You don't know what you're getting into here, I do. I'm older than you. I'm a teacher. - You're also a dick. - Better watch your mouth, son, or you'll get a detention on Monday. - Detention on Monday? You're worse than Kaplan. I got news for you dick. The forecast for tomorrow doesn't look good, let alone Monday. - You little punk. - Back off, dick. - (chuckles) Dick (laughing). - I think Craven's brain has flown to loony world for the night. What do you think, dick? - God damn it, stop calling me Dick. - Listen, we're going to the auditorium. You can come if you want. (Craven laughing) Help him up. (Craven laughing) - Wait, I'm coming. You mister are back on JV. - Let's go. (Craven laughing) (hard rock music) - Hi, guys. (hard rock music) Where's the bathroom? - Who are you? - Crystal, I'm with the band. - You're a Blood Sucking Ghoul. - [Crystal] Well, a Ghoulette actually. - Is the rest of the band in the auditorium? - Yeah. - You're coming with us. - Oh no, I've got a boyfriend. - We're trying to save you, not fuck you. - Oh. Wait a minute. Where's the bathroom? I really gotta go. - Hold it. - [Crystal] Well, hurry up. (suspenseful music) - God damn kids. (ghoul growling) (hard rock music) (Crystal screaming) (ghouls growling) ♪ I'm always falling outta bed ♪ Turn on the TV set (Crystal screaming) (ghouls growling) (Crystal screaming) - [Jeff] Oh, God! - Why are they doing this? - Oh, shit, they're coming! (ghouls growling) (Crystal screaming) ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence - What the fuck is this? - The dance committee, man. (ghouls grunting and growling) - Help us! - I don't think it was the dance committee, man. - Help him! (ghouls grunting and growling) - What's your name? - Steve. - Can I ask you a question? - [Steve] What? - What the fuck is going on, and who the hell is out there? - The swim team. Just push, we can't hold them much longer. - Oh shit, what're we gonna do? - We'll be back. - Wait a minute. (ghouls growling) (Crystal gasping) - [Roxanne] What the fuck is going on? - I don't know. (suspenseful music) - Grab those. Come on. (ghouls grunting and growling) - [Vicki] Come on, hurry up. - [Roxanne] Fuck this. - [Vicki] Roxy, wait! - What's she doing? - Taking charge. - Oh, this is a great gig. The kids are gonna love us. - That oughta hold them for awhile. - Hey, what the fuck is going on here anyway? - I wish I knew. - You mean you guys don't know? - [Steve] All we know is that they kill you and eat you. - And they're real pissed. - The whole fuckin' swim team? - [Jeff] We think so. - Maybe they should check the chlorine. - [Steve] It's not the fuckin' chlorine! - It doesn't make any difference what the hell it is. We've gotta figure a way out of here. - Just call the cops, man. - We tried but the phones are dead. - If you would all just listen to me. You can't just... - Shut up, dick. - Yeah, shut up, dick. - My name's not Dick. - She's right, we gotta find another way outta here fast. - No kidding me, but how? - I don't know, but we better work fast. These boards aren't gonna hold forever. (ghouls grunting and growling) (crickets chirping) - I don't like this. We got more important places to check out. Things are getting crazy. - Relax, there's probably none here anyway. Come on, let's get this over with. - What's the rush? I mean, maybe we should call the backup. - Forget about it. They got calls all over the city, it's crazy. We're not getting any help. (ghouls grunting and growling) (suspenseful music) - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I heard it. We have to check it out. (police radio chatter) - What do you think? - Looks quiet, wait a minute. - What the hell is that? - I don't know, I can't see it. (Ghouls grunting and growling) ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence ♪ This is violence - What do you think? - [Jeff] It's kinda dark, but I think someone can get through. - [Steve] Are you sure? - Yeah, but I wouldn't wanna be in it if one of those things got in there. - [Steve] Come on down. The only problem is where does this thing lead to? - Yeah, and who's gonna go? - [Roxanne] That's not a problem. - What're you talking about? - I'm going. - So, who's going? - I am. - [Jeff] Really? - No, she's not. - Why not? - [Blade] Because. - Well, that's a good reason. - You don't have to go. One of us will. - Yeah, it can get real hairy in there. - Cut the bullshit. You guys don't want me to go because I'm a woman? Well, fuck that shit. I'm the only choice. We need you here to take on those ghouls in case they break through, and I don't think Vicki and Crystal are up to it. Besides, I'm almost outta cigarettes. - Those things are gonna kill ya, Rox. - Yeah, I'm gonna give them up one of these days, maybe tomorrow. - [Steve] If she's going, she better get moving. We're running out of time. - [Blade] Yeah, right. Okay, I guess you're it then. - [Roxanne] Don't worry, I'm coming back. I'm managing the band, remember? - [Blade] How could I forget it? - [Steve] Here, you better take this. - Keep it, if I don't make it, you'll need it here. - You better take this though. - Thanks, I have two of my own. (light rock music) I'll see you later. - [Blade] Most definitely. - [Jeff] Good luck. - You too. (light rock music) I gotta give up smoking. It's gonna kill me. (light rock music) - [Steve] You okay? - What, yeah, yeah, I'm okay. (ghouls grunting and growling) - Let's make sure those doors are still holding tight. - Yeah. (ghouls grunting and growling) - [Steve] Still at it, huh? - Yeah, man. - Where's Vicki and Crystal? - They're down by the stage. Those fuckin' ghouls are getting to them, and they're getting to me too. (ghouls grunting and growling) (doors thudding) - Hey, they stopped. - What the fuck? - I don't think we... - Shh, somethings wrong. - Maybe the dance committee showed up after all, man, and took care of them (laughing).
