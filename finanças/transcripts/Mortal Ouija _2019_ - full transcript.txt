Bye-bye. - Bye. BEEP - Hello? Yep. INDISTINCT CHATTER Morning, sir. COLIN: Thank you. DAVE: ...victim's name is Amélie Martine Josette Delagrange twenty-two years old, born 2nd February 1982. Been in the UK two months working at a patisserie on Lyntall Street. Her ID has been confirmed by the manager. Amélie's parents live in France and she spoke to them regularly. Have they been informed? - French police are doing the honours. Her address is 55 Paynters Road, Twiokenham. Now, that's two streets north of the Green where she was attacked. DCI Colin Sutton is taking over as Senior Investigating Officer but there is one more thing I want to say, um... I've heard murmurs about Operation Upwey but there's currently no reason to link this with the Marsha McDonnell murder. We've got a good suspect in that case, sectioned up in... CLIVE: Newcastle, Guv. - Thank you, DC Grace. Yes, there are similarities, but for now we stay focused on Amelie. Thanks, Dave. Um, well, most of know me already, but for those of you who don't I'm more John Major than Churchill when it comes to speeches... THEY CHUCKLE - so I'll keep it simple. Me, you, all of us, we give this everything we've got. Alright. Everything. That's all. Thanks. - INDISTINCT CHATTER Hello Clive. - Guv'nor. How goes it? Uh, yeah, moving house, but apart from that I can't complain. Oh, well, you know what they say? Third most stressful thing after bereavement and divorce. Whoever decided that probably wasn't Old Bill, were they? CLIVE: No, probably not. Long overdue if you ask me. - What? You getting a case like this. Oh, cheers, Clive. Um, you're not convinced either, are you - there's no link to Marsha? Well, doesn't matter what I think, does it? YOU? I think these things are rare, and we've got two very similar victims in the same safe corner of south London. CLIVE: Sir. - Need to talk staffing before I go. Uh, yeah, 'm a “(mute Guvnor. I've just got a few things I want to get off and running. Fine. I'll be in your office. Great. Cheers, Clive. Jo. Jo. - JO: Just a sec. Just a few things. It's your biggest case ever and you're brioking it? Yeah, don't write that down. Get TIU to give us data on calls and cell-sites, not just billing. OK. Jonesy's already volunteered his services as CCTV officer. COLIN: Course he has. Sitting in a dark room... - JO: Thanks. ...watching videos of strangers with crap lighting. Right up his alley. - SHE CHUCKLES Shouldn't you be making me a cup of coffee? Uh, of course Guv. - JO: Thanks, Gary. Make sure Jonesy casts the net wide. Shops, banks, ATMs. Every frame, every camera, everywhere she might've been. Yeah, who's to say she wasn't being followed? - Exactly. We could have a face by tonight. Guy? Need a signature. Hire cars, twenty and counting. COLIN: Sir. I got you some help tee'd up from the Flying Squad the Kidnap Squad and the other Murder teams. Should take you up to sixty or seventy. - Oh, that's great, Andy. I'll keep the Up-Aboves off your back and, uh and handle the media for the first few days. I'm helping you out. I'm not muscling in. - Alright. This is gonna be huge. The press are gonna be all over it. I'm already fending off local community numpties and four different branches of Neighbourhood Watch. Thank you, sir. So, who's gonna be your number two? BS Jo Brunt. Uh, we worked together on-- - You can have Jo but, uh... your deputy's got to be a DI. What about Richard Ambrose? I don't know him, sir. He was on the Marsha job. Oh, right. So you think it was the same bloke? I think we keep an open mind until there's proof either way. Hm... You're gonna need an extra DI. Chris Saunders is available. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. - He's been up in Enfield. Earned his spurs by all accounts. - Yeah, we can do better. Chris is on your team, Colin. Get over it. Truth is not everyone thinks you're up to this. Like who? Doesn't matter. Just go out and prove 'em wrong. DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS RADIO ANNOUNCER: LEIC 97.3. NEWS MUSIC PLAYS REPORTER: A woman was found last night with a serious head injury lying on Twickenham Green in southwest London. She was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she was pronounced dead shortly after midnight. Metropolitan Police have yet-- - HANDBRAKE CRACKS CROWD CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY POLICEWOMAN: Can I help you, sir? - Yeah, I'm DCI Colin Sutton. I'm the SIO. We need to tape the pavement on all sides of the Green. And, uh... can we put these somewhere safe on the other side of the street and make sure that that's as close as our friends from the press get? Thank you. Gary. Ludlow. CLIVE: Guv. Might have something from the house-to-house. Back in April, a woman named Adele Harbison was attacked 'bout a quarter of a mile north from here. And she'd been in that restaurant with some mates. Attacked how? - Uh, three or four heavy blows to the head. Now, her route took her across the Green but she doesn't remember anything after leaving the restaurant. Who found her? - A Good Samaritan. But it turns out that wasn't the scene of the crime. They found her bags in a pool of blood about four streets away. Anything stolen? Uh, “handbag, mobile, shopping,” all present and correct. That rules out robbery. - Yeah, not quite. Now, apparently 8000s found an open carton of orange juice in her shopping. Now, I'm thinking, thirsty work attacking women. And? Did forensics get anything off the carton? TBC. - What d'you mean “TBC”? Yeah, well, I called Twiokenham but they said the DC who handles forensics is on a job. So we don't know if they got prints or DNA? I'll give him a call. No, get over there now! If he's our guy and he's in the system then we got him. Yes, Guv. JO: Sir! GARY: Guvnor. French police. What is it? - They want us to tell Amélie's parents. They've given us a number. Let me have it. This is Detective Chief inspector Colin Sutton. We're investigating the murder of French national Amélie Deiagrange and we need you to inform her parents that she's dead. FRENCH POLKZEMAN: Yes, I explained to your colleague it's better if you ca" them. Listen, I don't know how you do things in France but we don't tell people over the phone that their children are dead. I'm sorry... - DIALOGUE TURNS INDISTINCT No, forget it. We'll get in touch with the British Embassy in Paris and they“ send someone over' - I'm sure that's not necessary. Then do I have your word that you'll tell them in person? OK, yes. Thank you. Unbelievable. Thanks, Gary. - Guv. Jo. Mr Morris, could you tell my colleague what you told me, please? What, everything? - Yeah, please. Last night I was kicking a ball about with my kids, about half-nine. There was this guy hiding behind the screens. Dark hair. Stubble. Looked a bit like Maradona. Maradona? - Yeah. And I had this... this sense he was watching my kids, y'know? Like, spying on them. And he was behind the screens? - Yeah. So how could you tell what he looked like? Well, he was peeking around the sides. Right. And you had a bad feeling about him? Yeah. Yeah, I did. What, you think I'm making it up? - No. When people have a bad feeling about someone, there's usually a reason. Not always, but often. He was smoking. Can't be sure, but looked like roll-ups. Well, like I said, we'll need you to come in and make a statement, OK? Alright. Thanks. Yeah, thank you. - Thank you. JO: Diego Maradona. - Yeah. Makes a change from Phil Mitchell. What d'you think? I think he seems pretty solid, actually. Yeah, if he's right about that time that's less than an hour before she was killed. CROWD CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY - MICROPHONE TUNES SPEAKER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Murphy. The body of a French national was discovered on Twlckenham Green shortly after ten o'clock last night. I can now confirm that her name was Amélie Delagrange, age 22. It's believed that she had been drinking with friends in Tw/ckennam. .. SPEECH SWITCHES TO TV ...but was alone at the time of the attack. A dedicated, highly experienced team are currently vigorously pursuing all avenues of inquiry. Look at Murph's chin. Telly adds ten pounds, easy. I can't tell you much else for now but I will take a couple of questions. Yes. MALE REPORTER: Can you tell us if you're pursuing a link with Milly Dowler? ANDY: loan tell you that we've no reason to believe that the cases are linked at this point in time. U", yes? What about the Marsha McDonnell murder last year? Yeah, we have a suspect for that case. But, you haven't charged them? Uh, the subject's being detained under the Mental Health Act. What if he didn't do it'? I mean, what if Marsha and Amélie were killed by the same person? Well, there are similarities, certainly, but there are also key differences. But, isn't it possible that there is a serial killer out there? It's important that we do not cause public panic with unfounded speculation. People are scared. What can you say to reassure them? That we are very confident with the calibre, scale and direction of this inquiry Thank you. That's all for now. Thank you very much. - CROWD UNSETTLES Oh, Guv. Post-mortem. HE CLICKS HIS TONGUE Yeah. MOBILE PHONE RINGS Kat, you alright? Yeah. Fine. You said to call. Uh, yes. I did, um, thank you. Listen, can you do me a favour... “for the next few weeks I don't want you getting the bus or walking home after dark, OK? Is this about the girl in Twiokenham? Yes. Good guess. Everyone's talking about it. Yeah. So, if you're gonna be late call me or your mother or get a black cab and I'll give you the money. OK. - OK, thank you. Speak soon' Bye. - Bye. DI Richard Ambrose. They said to meet you here. Colin. Welcome aboard. Andy Murphy speaks very highly of you. - Likewise. Oh, he must be right then. - RICHARD CHUCKLES You were on the Marsha McDonald murder weren't you? - Yeah. We've got five minutes, you want to tell me about it? Five minutes? We won't get far. Cappuccino? Latte? I have to tell you, they both taste exactly the same. Yeah, I've been here a few times myself. - Yeah, of course, yeah. The suspect up in Newcastle - Taylor, right? Adam Taylor. That's right. What's the strength of him? On the night Marsha was killed, about two hours earlier a girl called Tracey Brown reported being followed. Panda oar responded, but the bloke scarpered. How far from the Marsha scene? 'Bout a mile, give or take. Right. And the thinking was that it was the same bloke? Yeah, we put Taylor in an ID parade, got Tracey in. And she picked him out? - Yeah. 99 percent it was Taylor who followed her. Fitted her description to a tee. Uh, beyond that there was no link to Marsha? - No. After you'd arrested Taylor... We never nicked him. He was sectioned before we got the chance. OK, but after you'd picked him up things were wound down? Yeah. Cheeky question, did you think that was premature? I had my doubts, yeah. Afternoon, Colin. Uh, Richard, this is Rob Chapman. Rob, this is DI Richard Ambrose. We've met before. Oh, forgive me, what was the case? Marsha McDonnell. ROB: This way gents. DOOR CREAKS - WIND CHIMES SOUND Detective Sergeant Jo Brunt. Are you Vanessa? Yes. Is there somewhere where we can talk? Do you want to go in the back? That's, um, me and Amélie at Chessington World of Adventures. Dragon Falls. We both got one. Amélie has the same key fob? I'm sorry. Don't be. It's normal. Vanessa, I need to ask you some questions about last night. Do you think you're up to it? I'll try. - No rush. No pressure. OK. So, you and Amélie were out with two friends in a French bistro in Twickenham last night, correct? Uh, yes. What time did you get there? Mm, about eight. We came straight from work. I keep thinking she's gonna walk in for her shift. She was just... so special. One of those people you meet and it's like you've known them all your life. ROB: Now, the victim is a previously healthy 22-year-old female identified as Amélie Delagrange. There is evidence of massive blunt force trauma to the back of the skull. COLIN: Any ideas about a weapon? Could be a hammer. The wounds are squarish in shape. So, not a conventional one then? I can't say for a hundred percent but I'd say not... it, it looks more like a roofer or a panel beater's hammer. Just like Marsha. - Similar, certainly. The wounds are too ragged for an exact comparison. I'm sorry. I'll take 'similar' for now. PHONE RINGS OFFICER: Meeting guys. Chop chop. JO: Jonesy? - NEIL: Yeah. PHONE STOPS RINGING What have you found? What does it mean? And what do we do next? Clive, could you tell us about that earlier assault? Yes, Guv. Chance of a link to an attack near the Green a few months ago. Adele Harbison, 34, blonde, struck over the head. Now, that's a compelling number of commonalities with Amélie. We're trying to get forensics off an orange carton in Adele's shopping, but that's TBC. Still? Uh, yeah, we're promised an answer by tonight, Guv. Not jumping to conclusions, are we? About a link? Well, it's the same location, similar victimology. Warrants a second look at the very least. - Well, you can understand my confusion. Murph's telling the media we're not focusing on links, and here we are looking for one. Well, if you're confused by anything else, Chris, my door is always open. It says 'Governor' on it. THEY LAUGH Forensics. They have a ton of prints off the side screen, but no match in the database so... no clue as to who Maradona is. LD'ing this man seen on the east side of the Green at 9.30 is a priority, OK? Maybe it was Maradona. Fucking 'Hand of God', wouldn't put it past him. THEY LAUGH - COLIN: Jonesy? Yeah, we've asked Telephone Intelligence at the Yard for cell dumps and the financial boys for credit card activity. Uh, Jo, you went to visit, um, Vanessa, Amélie's boss at the patisserie? Yeah, she was at the French bistro last night with Amélie and two other friends thinks Amelie left around 9.30 and said she was gonna walk home. She remembers her carrying a Disoman and a handbag with a mobile and a purse, all of which are missing. Should be easy enough to source a photograph of the phone. What about the handbag? Got a pretty detailed description from Vanessa. Alright. Can anyone here draw? A-level Art, grade D. - THEY CHUCKLE COLIN: Still a pass, isn't it? Get over to Smith's and get some crayons. - THEY LAUGH Uh, Gary, any more from the house-to-house? Uh, we've covered Hampton Road and Staines Road and their side streets. Nothing. COLIN: The middle of Twiokenham, just after ten, and nobody saw a thing. That's about the size of it, Guv. So, she was coming from here, and she lived here. So there was no reason for her to cross the Green walking home. COLIN: So, maybe she wasn't walking. Let's have a look at the bus routes and the cab companies. That's all, thank you very much. INDISTINCT CROSSTALK Tough start? Um, yeah. A few frustrations, sir. I'll need more than a drawing of a bag, Colin. You got anything else? Anything solid? Um... not yet, sir, no. Nothing that will help us. Excuse me. Thanks. Where are we, Jo? Maradona? SHE SIGHS Early days. You think I'm up to this? - Of course you are, stupid. Well, you're as good for this as anyone. Now you've ruined it. Guv. The orange juice carton looks like someone had a bit of a spring clean 'round the property store. You are having a laugh. - No. That's why they were oagey. They knew they'd binned it, before it'd been near a lab. STEVE: Louise? Superintendent Steve Scott. Good to meet you properly. You too. You OK to review your open cases tomorrow? - Sure. Always like to get an analyst's perspective. Yeah, no problem. - Hm. MOBILE PHONE RINGS - Oh, sorry. Goodnight. - Thanks, sir. How did it go? - Long day. Shall I get us a curry? OK. Sure you've got time? MOBILE PHONE RINGS Coir??? - I've gotta go. PHONE BEEPS - COLIN: Sir? The local nicks are drowning in calls, Colin. It's a pain in the arse, but we've got to keep the public onside. A community meeting? I'm afraid so. I know you haven't got time. You're gonna have to make it. Alright. - PHONE BEEPS SIREN WAILS Boss wants to go over our open cases tomorrow. What? You mean Milly Dowler? That'll be one of them, sure. - Well, good for him. Two years on and no new leads. - Well, that's what reviews are for. Fresh perspectives. Doesn't sound like you've got much to go on. Without your juice carton. Ah, no, not much. Dare I say that a prioritisation matrix is standard procedure in Surrey? Oh, yeah, we're not so blinded by science in the Met. Listen to you. Progress is nothing to be scared of. That's just a posh way of saying 'round up the usual suspects' isn't it? I know you don't set much store by behaviourists but they can taper your suspect pool. Yeah, unless they're wrong in which case, my killer gets yanked out of the pool before I've met him. Taper. Not shrink. It's about prioritising suspects, not dismissing them. Semantics. And it's not old school did-he-wet-the-bed-as-a-kid profiling either. A matrix reflects an offender's habitat, routines and education. Alright. I'll run one up the flagpole. You just want me off your back. Yes, I do. But I'll do a prioritisation vector anyway. Matrix. - Matrix. What? Look, call me paranoid, but at Surrey, even after we'd got together I had the sense that you didn't take me seriously. I mean, my work as an analyst. - That's not true. Then prove it. Don't shut me out. OK? - OK. GARY: Morning, Guv. - COLIN: Gary. CHRIS: Morning, Guv. - Chris. DETECTIVE: Guv. Morning. - Boss Amélie's parents are flying in tomorrow afternoon. Oh, yes... we're putting them up and, um, picking up the flights, too. Sounds like she was a much-loved daughter. Yeah, I want to be there to greet them. Oh, um... What do you think? COLIN: Oh, that's actually quite good. I just mocked it up. Thank the resident artist. Oh, well done, Chris. - Man of many talents. Well, you're good at drawing handbags, anyway. Speak to the press officer. Let's get this out to the papers and all the news bulletins and splash copies around Twiokenham Green... the pubs, the shops, all the usual. - Yep. Is it alright to claim the crayons back, Guv? Chris, that's one ninety-nine. You can afford that on your inspector's salary. Guv. Amélie's phone last pinged on the T-Mobile network at 22.23 hours on the 19th of August. That's twenty minutes after she was attacked. Yeah, handshake registered on a mast in Walton. COLIN: What sort of area are we talking? Well, about 500 square yards, uh, it's north of Walton bridge. Yeah. - After that last handshake there was an implicit detachment. - COLIN: What's that mean? The phone was switched off? - Uh, no, that's an explicit detachment. Implicit means one of three things - someone's pulled the battery out, trashed the phone, or it's in the dead spot. Well, we can rule out option three, can't we? - CLIVE: Yeah, I think so, Guv. We've got the parameters of the quadrant. - This is great work, guys. Twiokenham Green to Walton's six miles and we know he dumped the phone at ten twenty-three. He's in a vehicle. If I'm dumping the phone of a girl I just murdered I'm chucking it in the river every time. River's not in the mast quadrant, Guv. He's right, sir, it's not. It's close enough. We're searching it. INDISTINCT TRANSMISSION All well, Dive Two. All well, Dive Two. JO: Who knows who any of this shit belonged to? The dive team just got a call about another job, Guv. And? - Well, what do you want me to tell them? Tell them to keep looking. Nothing's changed. Every inch of the river... - PHONE RINGS ...thirty yards from the bridge gets searched. If it's not there I need to know it's not there. Yes, Guv. Stay here. Make sure they keep looking. Yes, Guv. - PHONE BEEPS Jonesy. NEIL: We gather on CCTV, Guv, getting on a bus. We've already lD'd the bus driver and spoken to him. There. What's she saying to him? - She missed her stop. She's asking how often the buses went. She walked back. Looks like it, Guv. That's why she had to go across the Green. She missed her bloody stop. CHRIS: We need to wrap this up. No word from the Guv'nor to that effect, sir. - HE SIGHS CHRIS: For fuck's sake. Who chucks their sunglasses in the river? I dunno. I had a pair once that really chafed my nose. I'm gonna make a call. BREATHING THROUGH DIVING MASK It's a wild goose chase. Sir! COLIN: We've had luck with the river. Father Thames gave up her house keys, her purse and her CD player. No, that's not luck, Guv, that's sticking to your guns. Yeah, but we still haven't found her phone or bag. The search is ongoing. So, we know that she was attacked around ten o'clock on Twickenham Green. We know her phone went off line at 10.23 in Walton when it was dumped in the river. So, we know he's in a vehicle we know he went from the Green to Walton, and we know when. But, we don't know his route. COLIN: No, but there's only a certain number of ways you can make that journey in twenty minutes. And we intend to find out which one he took. HOW? CCTV. It's an enormous area so Jonesy, you've got your work out out. No, I'm only joking. He's gonna need some help. DETECTIVE: Guv. Thank you. Thank you. He's gonna need more than that. OK, I'm volunteering you and you and you. All on CCTV, Guv? - COLIN: All on CCTV. What are we looking for? - We don't know yet. But we know he's in a vehicle. That's all. Thank you very much. INDISTINCT MURMURING COLIN: And while I'd urge you all to still go about your business, it's vital that you pay more attention to your surroundings, especially at night. So, now I'd like to open this meeting up for questions. Yes, madam. The High Street aside, Twiokenham has very poor lighting. Certainly compared to Richmond and East Sheen. Well, we'll pass that on to the Council and I'm sure they'll remedy it wherever possible. Thank you. - You're welcome. Any other questions? Well, in that case-- It is a nonsense, is it not, Chief Inspector for the police to go on television and say these crimes may not be linked. Why should we suddenly have a spate of murderous attacks on our peaceful streets committed by lots of different people? What my colleague said is correct. These of fences have not been formally linked. But they do comprise a 'Linked Investigative Series'. Yeah, no, I know, that sounds like a lot of jargon so I want to explain it properly. Please do. We can't formally link these of fences without conclusive proof that the same person carried them out such as fingerprints or DNA. However, because they are so similar it makes no operational sense to have them investigated by different teams. Declaring this a Linked Investigative Series means the cases all get examined under one roof by the same team. Maximizing our chances of success. Thank you. That's... it's good to know. - You're welcome. Any other questions? PHONE RINGS Sir? 'Linked Investigative Series' - you better copyright that. I know. I was on the spot. Uh, it wasn't my intention to contradict what you'd said... Forget it. You did well. Bullshit always baffles brains. BOTH CHUCKLE Well, it wasn't complete bullshit, was it? KNOCKING ON DOOR Amélie's parents are getting in at seven. - Ah. You - you're up to your eyes, Guv. I'll take care of reception duties. Who's your Family Liaison? Uh, Gary Fuller. ANDY: Well, just send him. I'll take him with me, but I need to see them. Thanks Richard, thanks very much. Guv. - Yep. Ah, it's this one. Monsieur Delagrange? - Yes. Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton. This is Family Liaison Officer, Detective Constable Gary Fuller. Please come in. - COLIN: Thank you. Madame Delagrange. Colin Sutton. MADAME DELAGRANGE: It's kind of you to put us up in such a nice hotel. It's the least we can do. The staff are very friendly. - Yeah. COLIN: Oh, good. Well, Gary is here to look after you. If there's anything you need just ask. Um, I'd like to ask you a question. Please just be completely honest in your answer. Of course. Would you like to visit the place where Amelie died? SHE GASPS Tu veux? MADAME DELAGRANGE: Hm? - Tu veuxyafler? Tm? HE SOBS Yes. Yes, we'd like that very much. Right. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. COLIN: Louise? - In here. COLIN: I'm sorry I'm so late. LOUISE: I expected it. Oh. Had to unpack some cases today. Shame we haven't actually moved yet. So? How was today? Oh, it was OK. Sorry, I'm exhausted. I can help. - You already have. We used your stand-alone database, and you're right, it's faster than HOLMES. So Surrey can teach the Met a few tricks after all. Mm-hm. The buyers are still faffing about. - Oh, you're joking. Need another week to get their money together. HE SIGHS If it falls through the agent says there is another offer, but it's lower. Oh, thanks for dealing with all that, luv. Here's how you show your appreciation. My brother's wedding. I know you'll have to do calls and stuff but... l want you there in body and spirit. I want you there. Body and spirit, eh? Hm. Well, alright then. And... when we move... - Mm-hm. If we ever bloody move... Let's form some new habits. Like what? Like weekends. We do stuff at weekends. That's a weekend. - Hm. When I look at that, it's ridiculous, but I am jealous. You look so relaxed, so yourself. I want to know that bloke. He was a bit of a tosser by all accounts. - I'm serious. MOBILE PHONE RINGS New habits. SHE CHUCKLES COLIN: Hello. MADAME DELAGRANGE SOBS MOBILE PHONE RINGS It's a work of art, Jonesy. Well, once I knew she walked back from the bus garage I started pulling in the cameras from the shops to plot her journey. Now look... the last footage of her is from this aooountanfs office at 22.01. She's about 150 yards south of the Green, on Hampton Road. We're getting closer. Hey. Do you want me? Yeah. Fancy some lunch, Guv? What's yours? Cheese and ham? - Hm. It's alright actually. How many have we got on CCTV now? Seven, full-time? Eight. That's quite a lot. What, it's ten percent of our team? Bit more, twelve and a half percent I think. You think it's too many? Yeah. I do. And so do some of the team. If we secure every piece of CCTV on every conceivable route from Twickenham to Walton then the killer's vehicle will be on it, Jo. But we don't know what that vehicle is. It could be a motorbike. - Yeah, it could. So, it's not a needle in a haystack, it's a needle in a stack of needles. Listen, Brunty. Car, van, motorbike, he's on those recordings somewhere but unless we secure them now they're gone forever. Yeah, yeah, OK. I hear ya. HE KNOCKS - DOOR OPENS Jonesy might've caught him on one of the bus cameras. What, a passenger? - External camera. Transport for London only started installing them front and back in January. INDISTINCT CHATTER Yeah. Watch this bay... watch this bay here. COLIN: What street's this? Hampton Road. We pieced this together from four different bus cameras. Now, this white van appears sometime between 2200 and 2205. And by 2208 - he's gone. And that's, what, a hundred yards from where Amelie was attacked? Seventy, I'd figure. - CLIVE: There's the cricket screens, Guv. JO: At the very least he's a witness. At the very least. Looks like a Fiesta with a box on the back. It's definitely a Ford. They'll tell us what model. Any chance of cleaning it up and getting a reg number? A fighting chance, I'd say, Guv. He's not a witness. My advice, don't pin everything on this van. That Van's our best lead, sir. If you don't play you can't lose. What, you think I should quit? COLIN: In March 2002, Bellfield and partner Laura Marsh were living in Collingwood Place, Walton-on-Thames. JO: And? Milly Dowler went missing in March 2002. JO: What are you thinking? I'm thinking, if he hit you with a hammer you wouldn't get up.
