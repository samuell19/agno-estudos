Making like a fish? - Hey, do you want to wait for him? - Nah, I'm hungry. We can starve before he gets in. - I'm with you. ("Dance Baby Dance" by Frank Sinatra Jr.) Hey, take it easy sport. - Mayonnaise, mustard, and some pickle relish, and just a little bit of sand. (both laughing) (upbeat music) (woman laughing) (heavy breathing) (heart beating) (ominous music) (woman screaming) (woman struggling) - Bunny? Bunny! (woman screaming) (siren wailing) (energetic music) - Where's the body? - It's right down there. (woman crying) - Where's the body? - She's over there, Sheriff, follow me. - All right, where were you kids when this thing happened? (all clamoring) Wait a minute, wait a minute, one at a time. What's your full name? - Richard Lindsay. - Where do you live, Richard? - Right up there in that house. - Hey Scott, come here. (suspenseful music) What do you make of this? - Footprints leading to that culvert. Where does the other end go? - It dumps into the ocean. (bright music) - Well Sheriff, it's not the claw print of any fish in this area. The men at the lab can't tie it down, either. They suggested that you, being an authority on fish, might know what it is. - It's amazing, it looks exactly like the South American fantigua fish. That's a carnivorous maneater. It could live in or out of water, weighs about 100 pounds. - Well that's a pretty good size, but whatever made that print had to weigh at least 250 pounds or more. - Well I'm afraid that's the best I can do for you. It certainly looks like the fantigua to me. Could be a mutation, of course. Some of the studies we've been doing here at the lab on mutations are amazing. - Mutating, could this fantigua fish grow large enough to come out on land? I mean, could it breathe out of water? - Yes, it could breathe out of water if it could retain fluid in its lungs. And as a mutation, our studies show it could grow quite large. I hope you can take one alive, Sheriff. It would be a boon to science. - Hold on, Doctor, I still believe that a human clawed that girl to death, not a fish, no matter how big, and we'll get him, too. Probably some madman. - Or one of those surfers of the hang around the beach all the time. They're capable of anything, even murder. - You think so? Strange, I always found them to be a nice bunch of kids just trying to find themselves. - They'll find themselves in your jail one day. I tell ya, Sheriff, something's got to be done about them. The boys are nothing but a bunch of loafers and their girls are little tramps. They contribute absolutely nothing to a decent society. - Well, that's not my department, Dr. Lindsay. Right now, I've got to find a murderer. Thank you for your help. I'll tell them in at the lab about this fantigua fish just to be on the safe side. I'll let you know if we find one. - Please do. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye. (bright music) (easygoing music) - Funny, I was swimming just where she was killed just a few hours before, it could have been me. I should have stayed around, I missed all the excitement. - Psycho. Bunny's dead, doesn't that mean anything to you? - What should it mean to me? What's the matter, Richard? Sorry it isn't me dead on that beach? You know, we should really try to get along together, for your father's sake. Just one big happy family. - Save some of that jazz for Dad, Vicky. He's the one that needs it. - Why, I'm a very loving little wife. - Don't give me that. I know exactly what you've been doing. - Oh, and what have I been doing? - Just keep away from me. Don't push me too far. - Why, is that anyway to talk to your stepmother? - Stepmother, you're not fit to be anybody's mother. Don't ever do that again, Vicky, I'm warning you. - Warning me, now you sound like Otto when he's in one of his crazy tantrums. - Vicky, Richard, where are you? - Remember what I said. - In the bar, darling. - Good evening, Vicky. Hi, son. I bumped into the Sheriff as I was pulling in, he told me about Bunny, I'm sorry son. It's a tragic thing to have happen. - Oh yes, poor Richard, it's upset him terribly. - I've got to get over to Janie's, Dad. She's been taking this pretty hard. - Oh, I was hoping we could spend some time together, some interesting things have been happening over at the lab. Remember that experiment you were helping me with? - Dad, not tonight, Jane's been half out of her mind over this. - Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Can I see you a minute, Richard? Good evening, sir. - Evening, Mark. - See you in the morning, Dad. Let's go to your room. - He hasn't too much time for your lately, has he? - Nah, he hasn't been in the lab for months. Ever since the accident, he's let his work slip, just hangs around the beach with those tramps. Vicky, I just can't understand his attitude. - I think Mark is playing on your sympathy. That limp's pretty convenient, it's gotten him a nice home. - I thought you liked Mark. - I was just being nice, that was over a year ago. How long is he going to stay? - After all, Richard was driving when they had the accident. He still feels responsible for the injury to Mark's leg. - So his brakes went out, it wasn't his fault. Does he have to carry Mark for the rest of his life? Do we all? - Vicky, he's my son and misses his home. If he wants Mark here, if he feels it's important, we'll all have to make the best of it. - Your son, everything for your son. - What about me? And Mark the sculptor, he's got his pottery all over this house. - I thought you liked posing for him, you said he was doing your statue. - Oh Otto, you're blind. Can't you see he's using you? He's taking advantage of you. Why, that accident was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him. And to ensure his soft touch, you lean more and more on Richard. He'll take him away from you completely, just as he's taking him from your lab. - He can't do that, not after all the plans I've made. Richard and I are going into research, I planned it for years. - Lord am I sick of hearing about that. Otto, you're hurting me. - I'm sorry, dear. Until I met you, my only happiness was planning for my son. Vicky, I love you both very much, nothing or no one will ever take either of you from me. - All right, let's forget it, you get so emotional. Ooh, I'll be bruised for weeks. - I'm sorry, dear, I didn't mean to hurt you. - All right, Otto, let's go, it's late. Had you forgotten the Board of Directors dinner tonight? - Good Lord, I did forget. I don't suppose we could get out of it. - Hardly, you know I do so look forward to those cozy little dinners. Let's talk about the murder tonight, and really shake them up. - Oh Vicky, stop it. Come on, let's go. - You're wrong about Vicky, you just don't understand her. You don't give her a chance. - Mark, look, let's forget it. What did you want to see me about? - Oh, a couple of things. One, Dale dropped by some film he said you want to see. - Oh, the film on Hawaii, where is it? - It's on the projector, and I wanted to show you something I did. - Let's take a look at it. I'll just have time to run it before I go to Jane's. - What is it with you and this surfing, Jack? All of a sudden, it's such a big thing. - Listen Mark, I'm just beginning to realize there's more to life than just test tubes and fish. I'm gonna live a little before I settle down again, gonna grab my girl and get married, then I'm gonna surf on the beach of Waikiki before I get too old to enjoy it. - I've got a feeling that is not what your father had in mind. - I know, I haven't found a way to tell him yet. But I've got to live my own life, Mark, not the one Dad's picked out for me. Life's too short, today proved that. Bunny's gone, just like that. I just want to store up some happiness for Jane and me before our time comes. - Rich, if the accident or my living in this house had caused you to change your plans to give up your career. - Mark, the accident just opened my eyes to what I've been doing, rather what I haven't been doing. I want you to stop taking life so seriously. Man, it goes by too fast, too fast to waste. Come on, get the lights. Wait til you see these films, the surf is great. (projector whirring) (upbeat music) (projector whirring) Why, I've got to show these to Jane, she'll flip. Hey, I've gotta get going. - Hold it, hold it. Now there's something else I want to show you, and it'll only take a minute. - All right buddy, what is it? - It's in my room, come on. It's over here. Rich, this is what I wanted you to see. - [Rich] It looks like Bunny. - I used her as a model a couple of months ago. I was wondering, do you think her folks would like to have it now? - I'm sure they would, why don't you take it over to them? - Well, it might be better if you took it over, I've never met her folks. - Come on, Mark, why don't you get off it? Stop being afraid of people. You made it, you take it over. - Yeah, I guess you're right. All right, I'll take it over tomorrow. - I've got to get going. Say, why don't you come with me, we'll stop by Bunny's house on the way back. - Oh, I can't tonight, I've got to work on Vicky's statue. - I'll see you. (bright music) - Vicky. (door slamming) - Are you sure you don't mind if we don't go down on the beach today? After Bunny, I-- - Of course not, I understand. Besides, there's plenty of sun around the pool. You know, I still can't realize she's gone, such a horrible death. The killer must be some kind of monster to cut her up like that. - Don't feel bad, honey. Let's try and forget it. I still love you, remember? (throat clearing) - My my, what a touching little scene. - Hi Vicky. - I see you brought one of your little mermaids home. How nice. Well, I'm going down to the beach before I play model for Mark, so you'll have the house all to yourself. Have fun, children. - Don't, Richard. (waves crashing) (happy music) You're right, it is beautiful by the pool. - Let's go to the bar, I want to talk to you. - Okay. - Want a Coke? - No thanks. - It's too bad the killer made a mistake, he should have hit her highness the evil queen. - That's nothing to joke about. - Who's joking? Charming conversation she gave us just now will show you what's on her mind most of the time. How a man like dad fell into that. He's well-known in the field of oceanography, and her cute little title for me in company is fish stock. Real dignity on her. - I know how you feel, Richard, but she's still his wife and there's no way you can change that. - If he could only see her for what she really is, two-timing, cheating-- - Hey, are you gonna let her ruin our whole day? I thought we were going swimming. - You're right, come on. It's amazing, every time she sees me she's just got to bug me. - Of course, she knows just how to get you mad. and you haven't sense enough to realize that she's doing it on purpose. You're not terribly bright, are you? You know, I really don't know what I see in you. - Oh, is that so? - Yeah, it is. (water splashing) - Pretty fancy, but watch this. - Hey Rich, hi Janie. - Hi, Mark. - Come on in, Mark, the water's great. - Oh, I can't, Vicky's coming over to pose this afternoon, she'll be here any minute. - Not this minute, she just left for a swim down at the beach. - Oh? - She'll be gone at least an hour, come in for a swim, Mark. It'll do your leg good. - No no, I can't, maybe later. - Come on, Mark it won't hurt you to get wet. - Oh come on, cut it out Rich, that isn't funny. - Hey Mark, he's only kidding. - Oh, sorry. Kind of edgy today, I guess. I just left Bunny's folks', I took over that statue I showed you. - Well, how'd they like it? - Oh fine, but they're taking it pretty hard. Police can't give 'em much information, still no clue as to who killed her. And Bunny's dad is really upset. You wouldn't believe what he thinks of the Sheriff. - Well, you can't blame him, the whole thing gives me the creeps. I feel so horrible. - What gets me is we were all so close, he couldn't do anything. If only she could have screamed to let us know she was in trouble, maybe we could have reached her in time. - Well, her parents don't blame any of you. They understand. I guess we just have to leave it up to the police and see what they find out. - Yeah, I guess so. - Hey, you two are supposed to be swimmers, so swim. (water splashing) - Hey, so it's alright for you to throw me in the pool, huh? - You're the water lover around here, sport, not me. - Okay now, Tarzan. - That's right, you Tarzan, her Jane. - Oh, you big. - Hey, I better get out of here before I get killed, I'll see you later. - You know, he's really a good guy, but I worry about him. He spends too much time by himself. - You're gonna be by yourself if you don't watch out. You never pay any attention to me. Oh, wow. - Okay, Esther Williams, you're pretty fancy, but watch this. Watch close now. This is the kind of dive you won't see every day. - I can believe that. (water splashing) (Jane laughing) (waves crashing) (bright music) (foreboding music) (bright music) - Hi, am I late? - Only about an hour and a half, where were you? - I thought I'd take a swim. - Well you're here now, shall we get started? - Don't be so grumpy darling, I'm ready. - In the wrong position. - You know, you artists fascinate me, you're so different from other men. - Ain't it always? Men are men. - Before I married Otto, I had a lot of friends, all men, of course, they're so much easier to get along with. - You keep moving. - But now I don't have any friends anymore. I'll bet you know what it's like to be lonely. You do understand. Ooh, you really are lonely, aren't you? - Please, Vicky. - Oh Mark, don't you think we've run this little game into the ground? - But Vicky. - But Vicky what? Did you think I'd make love to a cripple? Be grateful for a small favors, Mark. (suspenseful music) - I could kill her, I could kill her! (bright music) - Dad should be out of the lab any minute now. Thanks for coming along. Got a feeling he's gonna lecture me, I'm not up to it today. - Oh, here comes big daddy now. - Thanks for picking me up. Well, Mark, how'd it go at the doctor's today? - About the same, still no feeling in the leg. - I keep telling him he should be giving it more exercise. Why don't you come swimming with us tonight? Work it out a little. - Swimming? I thought you said you'd come back to the lab with me after dinner. - I'm sorry, Dad. Janie and I are going to a big party down on the beach tonight, I should have checked with her sooner. - Check with Jane, what about your work? How much longer do you think I can make excuses for you at the lab? - I want to talk to you about that, but not now. - [Otto] Why not? - Mark knows how I feel, we can talk in front of him. - It's got nothing to do with Mark. I'm not so sure. You weren't like this before the accident. Look, I spent years and money building up a reputation for you to follow it. Now look, son, what are you thinking of? - Dad, look out. I've had enough accidents for a while. - I'm sorry, but you're driving me crazy with this I don't care attitude of yours. Richard, what are you going to do? - Rich, pull over here. We're almost home, I can walk back, then you and your dad can talk it out. - Buddy, what kind of a friend are you? - Mark's right, let him out. We're going to talk this out right now. - You said I needed the exercise, remember? So long. - All right Dad, now hear me out without interrupting, okay? - Okay. - While I was in the hospital, I realized how close Mark and I came to being killed. You know, they say your whole life flashes before you, well mine did. Dad, ever since high school and college, all I've done is study and work. We never did take those vacations we talked about. We spent them all in the lab. - I thought you liked the work we did together, enjoyed oceanography. - I did, I do, but I want a little vacation. I want to find out about the other things in life. Dad, I want to play a little. - Play, good lord Richard, there's more to life than play. It's a serious business. Now, these past few months are lost, you can never get them back again. - I don't want them back, I wouldn't give up what I found for anything. - And what have you found? That you can swim in the ocean on a board? Do you think those beach friends will help your career? Or do you expect me to finance your playtime forever? - I have the money mother left me, if I'm too much of a burden for you. (soft music) - That's it, Richard, I don't want to hear any more about it. - Well, what's the fight about this time? - Oh, my son prefers a life of play to work. - So, who doesn't? - I won't allow it. I will not stand by and see him throw his life away. It's for his own good, I'll stop him somehow. - Sure you will. - Don't you care about this, how it affects me? - Frankly, Otto, I've had it up to here with you and your precious son. I don't care what you do with him, just leave me alone. - So that's what it's come to with us, is there nothing left? - We didn't have a heck of a lot to start with, lover. You got what you paid for, there were no guarantees. - Oh Vicky, can't we. - We can't anything, can't you get that through your head? (dramatic music) (glass shattering) (waves crashing) ("Dance Baby Dance" by Frank Sinatra Jr.) - Vicky? Oh, Vicky? (energetic music) - What did you want? - Don't you feel anything for me anymore? (soft music) - Otto, we've been married five years, the honeymoon's over. - Not for me, it isn't. - Otto, stop it. - Vicky, I love you very much. - You love your son and a stupid fish. - But you knew that five years ago. - For months on end you've left me alone in this house, you and Richard tied to that lab of yours. Well, if you really loved me, you would have taken me out, gone on trips, 100 things married people do together, not use me when it was convenient for you. - How can you say that? I have given you everything you've ever asked for. - There are some things even money can't buy. - Oh please, darling, let's start all over again. You've always wanted to go to Europe, we can see Paris. - It's too late, Otto, can't you understand? It's too late. - Vicky, we can't go on like this. Can't you even try to make a new start? - Yes, I'd like a new start away from you. - I won't let you go, Vicky. - Do you think you could stop me? How, how Otto? - You're mine, and I keep what's mine always. - Always is a long time. I wouldn't count on it. - Vicky, you're a, oh what's the use? (mellow music) (rotary spinning) - Hello, Pa? This is Vicky. I can't wait to see you, either, darling. It has been a long time. Well, I'm ready now. No, no trouble at all, I'll just tell him I'm going out with the girls. Okay, Malibu Sheraton, about a half an hour. Okay, now don't be late. Okay, bye. - Oh Vicky, come here. - What is it, darling? - Where do you think you're going? - I'm going out with the girls. - You've got a date, haven't you? - Why Otto, you do surprise me. - Vicky, I don't want you going out tonight. There's a killer loose around the beach. - A killer? Oh really, Otto, that's reaching, even for you. Ta ta. (energetic music) (group cheering) ("Dance Baby Dance" by Frank Sinatra Jr.) - Oh, Tommy. - Oh, Richard. - Hey Rich? - Yeah? - [Girl] Play that new song, will ya? - Which one is that? - More Than Wanting You. - Sure.

Mark killed him, I saw it. - Rich, it's not true, why should I kill Tom? It was some kind of a monster, a crazy-looking thing with a big fish head and some kind of a claw. - Mark, wait a minute. A monster here on the beach? - Look, he's all clawed up just like Bunny was. - We'd better call the Sheriff. - Richard, you can't believe that I did it. - I'll call the Sheriff. Brad, watch things, will ya? - You bet I will. (girl sobbing) (siren wailing) - When did this happen? - Just before I called you, 20 or 30 minutes ago. - Somebody's sure got it in for you kids, this makes two. - You think there's a connection between Bunny's death and Tom's? - Nobody else decided a monster, did you say? - I know it sounds crazy but I swear that's what I saw. You've got to believe me. I was walking down the beach when I saw Tom struggling with this, this thing. I called to you, but you didn't hear me. By the time I reached Tom, he was lying on the blanket dead. - Well what happened to this thing, this monster? - It ran away. I tried to follow, but it was too late. - There's your monster. I saw him killing Tom, killing Tom. You did it, you, you, you! - Easy now, take it easy. - She's crazy, she's wrong, Sheriff. - We'll go down to the station. And you, young lady, can make a written statement of what you've seen. - Are you arresting Mark, Sheriff? - Not for the moment, I just want his statement. This young lady's made a serious charge, I've got to look into it. (bright music) Scott, stay here with the body till the ambulance comes, will ya? I want pics of this whole area for the boys down at the lab. You kids get some clothes on and move down to the station, I might as well get all these statements at once. - Sue's pretty upset, does she have to come now? - She'll be all right, the doctor at the station will give her a sedative. Scott, stop him. (gun firing) (girl screaming) He's out of range, it's no use. So your friend saw a monster, eh? - Looks bad, Sheriff, but I can't believe he'd kill anyone. I know Mark. - Well, somebody's out after you kids and right now he gets my vote. - Oh, thanks for the wonderful evening, Paul. Just like old times. I'll call you soon, bye. (door slamming) (engine revving) (romantic music) (chimes jangling) Mark? Mark? (ominous music) Mark? Mark? It's Vicky. Mark? Is that you, Mark? (Vicky screaming) (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (foreboding music) - Hey, take it easy, it's my car you're driving, remember? - Don't worry. You know, that's the first time I was ever in a police station. All those questions. - I know what you mean, they made me feel guilty. I sure wish I knew where Mark was. - Richard, do you think the Sheriff was right? That the same person that killed Bunny killed Tom? - What if Mark's right? What if it isn't a person at all, some kind of a sea monster? - Oh, that's a scary thought. I don't think I'll ever go down on that beach again. - Not till the killer is caught, anyway. You know, Dad and I were working on mutations at the lab a few months ago and Dr. Schiller in Switzerland put out a paper on the same thing. Seems that by certain radioactivity in KCl beams, he grew a turtle to three times its normal size. - Do you really believe Mark's story? - Mark's not a liar. He had no earthly reason to kill Tom or Bunny. The only thing the Sheriff has on him is Sue's accusation. He wasn't even on the beach when Bunny was killed. - Well, we didn't see him anyway. - No, it's not Mark. I had a very funny feeling about all this. Why hasn't anyone else seen the killer? Why has it struck only one of our group? What could it possibly have against us? What if the killer's someone we know? - Maybe it's something about the area. Listen Janie, both killings occurred in the same place right on the beach below my house. - [Jane] What's your house got to do with it? - Not the house but the area. What if there's some place for the killer to return to to hide in waiting? That rock cave, for instance. - Hey, where are you going? - Taking you home and I'm going back to the beach and look around. - Oh no you don't, I'm going with you. - You're not, it might be dangerous. - Well, then I'm definitely not gonna let you go down there alone. I'm going with you and that's that. (waves crashing) (ominous music) What are we looking for? - I don't know, something that shouldn't be here, I guess. - Well, the Sheriff's men have been all over the sand and they haven't found anything. - Wait here, Jenny. I'll just be a minute. - Okay, be careful. (somber music) (cat hissing) - I guess I was wrong, couldn't find a thing. I was so sure there was something about this place. - Oh, let's get out of here, this whole place gives me the creeps. - We'll go to my house and make you some hot coffee. Guess I'm not a detective, after all. I'll have to find another way to help Mark. (energetic music) (frantic music) (Jane screaming) - Dad! Mark. (suspenseful music) (sirens wailing) Come on. - It's Richard's father, he just killed Mark. - You've gotta stop him, Sheriff, I think he's gone mad. - Take it easy, son, we'll stop him. - Hurry, Sheriff, he's getting away! - No he won't. Car 127, Car 127, this is Sheriff Michaels here, come in. - Car 127 reporting, Scott here, over. - All right, Scott, be on the lookout for a, uh, was he in that white MG that just took out? - He must have taken Janie's car. - Scott, it's a white MG convertible. He should be passing you on the Hill Road just about now. Apprehend immediately, but use extreme caution. It's our beach killer. - I just picked him up, he's turning into the Tri Canyon Road. I'll continue the chase until further instructions, over. - Good, stay with him. I'll get the other canyons covered up, 10-4. Boxed himself in. Attention all units, attention all units in a Tri Canyon Road area, Sheriff Michaels here. Be on the lookout for a white MG convertible, cover Malibu Canyon Road. I'll cover the cliff mountain road myself. Report immediately as soon as vehicle is sighted, 10-4. All right, kids, let's go. (sirens wailing) (dramatic music) - Why did he do it, Sheriff? I'm afraid he thought he was doing it for you. - For me? - That's right. - Sheriff Michaels, calling Sheriff Michaels, Car 127 reporting, come in please, over. - Michaels here, go ahead Scott, over. - Suspect now turning into cliff mountain road. You should sight him any minute now. I got him, Scott, okay 10-4. (tires squealing) - Can't you go faster, Sheriff? - Whoa kid, relax, he's not getting away. (tires screeching) - He must be insane. (Otto screaming) (car crashing) (car exploding) - Can't you catch him, Sheriff? - Hold on! (Jane screaming) (tires squealing) - I guess we lost him. - Look back there, Sheriff, he must have gone over the cliff. - You're right, come on. (upbeat music) - I'm going down there. - It's no use, you couldn't get within 50 yards of that car.
