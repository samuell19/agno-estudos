Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. - What, jealous Oberon? - Tarry, rash wanton, am I not thy Lord? Then I must be thy lady, but I know when thou hast stolen away from fairyland and in the shape of Corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous Phillida. And never, since the middle summer's spring, you meet the mortal again-- by dale, by forest, by paved fountain, nor rushy brook, nor on-- I cannot continue. I think I detect a little agitation from behind. What is this? Who dares to agitate Mr. Crummles' fairy king? I do. And what is your grumble, sir? He is. I was once this company's Romeo. The romantic lead. And now look at me, reduced to nothing more than a fairy cobweb. What have you got to say for yourself, sir? But, Mr. Lenville, I play the parts I'm told to play, nothing more. You should refuse them, sir. And why should he do that, sir? Because I say so, sir. Mr. Lenville, if my playing Romeo or Lysander distresses you, I'll happily hand them back. You will do no such thing, Mr. Nickleby. You'll play the parts as publicized. By what right, sir? Oh, look to the ladies, sir. Mr. Nickleby's face is our good fortune. You embarrass me, ma'am. You will be.... What are you doing? I'm going to pull your nose, sir. Pull my nose? Yes, in the presence of the company. You lay one hand on my nose, sir-- My face. I'm ruined. My best side, my prince's profile. Come, Mr. Lenville, let us shake hands and forget it. Never. Mr. Lenville, shake his hand. Never...ever. If you do, Mr. Lenville, you can play Hamlet at Harwich, Chelmsford, and Reading. Very well. Now, places. Places, ladies and gentlemen, please. Let us continue with our Midsummer's reveries. As I said at the time, Kate, a dressmaker's shop is the last description of business to which you should have thought of attaching yourself. I do not reproach you, my love, but if only you had consulted with your own mother. Well, then, mama, what do you recommend now? Recommend? Well, that's obvious. Tomorrow morning I shall pay a visit to your uncle. No, please, my uncle's done quite enough. Nonsense. - She's a devilish pretty girl, that cannot be denied. - I supposed she is, lord. - Then tell me where does the beauty live? - There's no good can come of it. She is a country girl at heart. She's not wise to London life. She's been virtuously and well brought up-- - A man may look at a pretty girl without harm, Nickleby. - Indeed, he may. Well, then. You know you're making a fortune out of me, Nickleby. I shall never do business with anyone else if you tell me. Oh, come on, out with it, man-- where does Miss Kate Nickleby live? Oh, Mrs. Nickleby to see you, sir. - Good morning, brother-in-law. - Mrs. Nickleby, I say, hello! Stay there, ma'am. This way, sirs. Is this Mrs. Nickleby the mother of Miss Nickleby, the delightful creature we had the pleasure of meeting at dinner? - Yes, indeed. - No-- this lady is far too young for that. Kate Nickleby is indeed my daughter. - Her daughter, my lord. - Why, I won't believe it! Oh, yes, it's true. And how is your daughter today, ma'am? I'm afraid she's a little downhearted, sir. I'm not sure why, perhaps she's suffering from something. I myself, I suffer constantly from them. Then perhaps you will allow us to escort you and your daughter to the opera, ma'am. - Oh, the opera! - Yes. Mozart. Do you like him, ma'am? I like anyone who is musical, my lord. Good, that's settled it, then. Head up. How's the memory, Smike? It comes and goes. Do you remember your first day in Yorkshire? Was it Mr. Squeers first brought you to the school? No, no. Another man. It's important if we're to find out who you really are. I remember a room, a lonely room where I slept. Mr. Nickleby. Mr. Emaciated Apothecary, Make haste. Our public beckons! What's the rush, Miss Nickleby? Do not detain me, sir. Why not? My dear creature, why do you keep up this show of displeasure? How-- How dare you speak to me in this manner? You're pretty in a passion. I like it, ma'am. I hold you in the bitterest contempt, sir. I intend to hold you like this, ma'am. - Let me go! - And where would you go, Miss Nickleby? Hmm? There's no where to go. You have no-- - Kate! What's wrong? - Your daughter's a little flushed, ma'am. I have been wronged, uncle-- and by your friends. I have no friends, girl. Day after day I am compelled to assume the appearance of cheerfulness. I have no one to protect or advise me. Mama supposes that these are honorable men. I cannot deceive her any longer. I need your help, uncle. - Well, how can I help you, child? - You have some influence with these men. We're connected in business, nothing more. I cannot afford to offend them. Uncle, I trusted you. We all have our trials, Kate. This is yours. Riches and power are the only true source of happiness. Some young ladies would be proud to have such gentlemen at their feet. Gentlemen! Oh, uncle-- Please. Listen to me. My home is a lonely one. If you would only consent to make it your home, too, it would bring me so much comfort-- a little light-- to grant some of the sweet nature that I know you have. Never, uncle. There's something of that boy's blood in you, I see. My father's blood, yes. And I am proud to know it, uncle. Very well. Then I cannot help you, Kate. Don't cry.... Don't cry. What a performance! And a very good house. On Monday morning-- - Monsieur Crummles. - Thank you. On Monday morning, we shall read a new piece. Everyone shall have a good part in it. Our Mr. Nickleby, here, will see to that. - Sorry? - You will write us a new piece, sir. I don't think I can write anything for Monday morning, Mr. Crummles. Why ever not? It's too soon, I haven't the invention. - Rubbish! You understand French? - A little.... Very good. Toss him a manuscript, my dear. There. Turn that into English and put your name on the title page. - 'Tis a fortified fire cracker! - A veritable hit, sir. I'll do my best. And now, a toast-- - Monsieur? - Autograph? - A letter, sir, for Mr. Nickleby. - Well, there's your man, over there. What's my part, Mr. Crummles, in the new play? You, Mr. Lenville, why, you turn your wife and child out of doors and in a fit of rage and jealousy you stab them both in the forest. And me, Mr. Crummles, what's my part? You are a trouble wretch, filled with remorse, you're overcome, burst into tears, and then, after a long, yearning hiatus, you transform and become a virtuous, exemplary character for us all. Very good. Get the curtain down on that, Mr. Crummles, and it will be a triumph. To be sure, Miss Bravassa, to be sure. - And now, a toast, to Mr. Nickleby. - Mr. Nickleby! - I must go. - Whatever is the matter? This letter, it comes from London. - The Drury Lane. - No, Mr. Newman Noggs. Never heard of him. Does he play the Haymarket? He's my uncle's clerk. Smike? Mr. Lenville. Thank you for everything, Mr. and Mrs. Crummles. Goodbye. Come on, Smike. How dare you show your face here, sir. I'm looking for my mother and sister. After all I've told you, you return to London, and still with that boy you've abducted! - Come here. - Leave him alone. My mother and sister, sir, you'll please tell me where they are. They are living in the house that I have provided for them, enjoying my care and support. If you've taken care of them as you did me, then I pity them. I warn you, boy, for their own good, stay away from them. ...and she smells uncommon similar, my lord. - Toast to little Kate Nickleby. - Nickleby! Little Kate Nickleby. I'm afraid the old woman, her mother, has been so jealous of her, she's locked her away! Oh, an infernal cunning! I like her better. I can do anything with the old lady, she believes anything I say. Unlike her uncle. Still, at least the old man introduced us to her. Miss Kate Nickleby! I'd like a word with you, sir. A mysterious stranger, upon myself! Will you step aside? Name your business or leave the table. Your name and address, sir. I shall give you neither. I am the brother of the young lady who has been subject of your derision. If you have a friend at this table who is a gentleman, then he will spare your disgrace and give me your name. Very well, I will follow you home. Oh, will you? Yes. Good lord.... Oh, what is that? A-a, a friend. Make yourself known to me, sir. Get out of my way. I will follow you. You'll be horsewhipped if you do. You are a scoundrel. And you are an errand boy, for all I know. I am the son of a country gentleman. - Bah! - I'm your equal! Will you or will you not answer for your brutal and unruly conduct? No. What are you doing? You will not leave, I swear it. Not until you tell me who you are. - Let go of me, I tell you. - No! Ride! Sir.... My mother and sister, Newman.... I must go to them. No. Rest. You're all wet through. There's some dry clothes in my bag. Your uncle's not going to like this. Those two gentlemen, are friends of his. Look at me. I should be a laughingstock, Nickleby. May I say how grieved I am that any relative of mine-- although disowned by me-- should have inflicted such punishment. - Punishment! - Yes! And I see it's been a severe one. Not as severe as the blow my friend, here, is about to serve on you, Nickleby. - I don't understand. - That is soft. I'm taking my business elsewhere. Lord Verisopht has decided to borrow his money from someone else. What about the money he already owes me, my lord? His outstanding debts are some three thousand pounds. - You can wait. - The compensation... - Compensation? - For this and your broken promises. What promises? That very expensive disappointment, your little niece. Your nephew's behaviour's upset a great many people-- Influential people. I will have my money from you, sir. You can depend on that. How did it go? Did you chill the old goat? Yes, I did. Good. Now to find his nephew. What are you doing, Hawk? You must not seek revenge. And who will prevent me, sir? I will...if I must. I believe the sister is a virtuous lady, and the brother acted as he should. Look to your business, boy, and leave me to look at mine. This is my business. I make it my business. This is a public argument, Hawk. I will not stand for it. Well then get out of my sight, sir, for where is the wisdom in talking to a coward? - Coward? You call me a coward, sir? - Yes, I do. What do you say. gentlemen? Don't you agree? Stay. Let go, sirs. Have I a friend here? He struck me! Yes, I struck you, sir. See here, gentlemen. Lord Verisopht is no coward. What do you say, sir? Huh? I say, let this quarrel be ended. I'm so happy you have returned. Promise you will never leave us again. I promise, Kate. Your uncle...he is a brute. And to think I had the ceilings whitewashed at the expense of one shilling which is the most distressing thing-- Oh, I cannot believe it. Everything I tell you is true, mother-- And as for Mulberry Hawk...such a monster! Why, I was congratulating myself every day on his being your admirer, Kate. I know, mother. Let me introduce my fellow traveler and affectionate friend-- Smike. Good morning, sir. G-g-good m-morning. Oh, my goodness. P-p-perhaps I-I-I should go... leave you with your family. From now on, you are family, Smike. This is all too much for me...really, it is. Nicholas, you must go to your uncle at once and ask him to explain himself. The time for talking is over, mother. We must disown him. Your honor and Kate's good name demand it, surely you see that. Oh, where will we go? How will we live? Oh, dear! Are you both ready? - Ready. - Ready. Very well.... Proceed! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Fire! The keys to the Thames Street house, uncle. What I did for your sister, I did with a good heart. You have no heart. - All you care about is money. - Good day to, sir. I'm going, and I see no reason why we should ever meet again. Be careful, sir. You've already made some powerful enemies in this city. And you among them. I will not have my reputation played with. What reputation? Your life is a lie. So like my brother. All the eloquence of a country parson. My father was an honorable man, sir. Yes, sir, and a poor one. Do you imagine that you're capable of looking after your mother and sister? You have nothing. You are nobody. And if I have my way, sir, this is how the matter will stand. I'm not frightened by your threats. I make no threats, boy. Good day.... Uncle. Road sweeper....pot washer.... All gone, yesterday. Nothing left? Well, you might find something that nobody else wanted on the board over there. Next. Dear me, dear me. Well-behaved young gentlemen reduced to such necessity.... Oh, no. - You make fun of me, sir. - Oh, no, stay! Don't run away. Look here. I, ah. I may be able to help you. Good morning, gentlemen, good morning to you. Morning, Frank! Good morning, uncle. This is my nephew, Mr. Nickleby. - How do you do, sir? - Brother Ned! - Goodbye my dear. - Thank you, goodbye. Mr. Nickleby. What brings you to London, sir? - My father,he-- - A bad thing, for young man to lose his father. Oh, indeed, brother, indeed! You've brothers and sisters, too, aye, I bet. - A sister. - Poor thing (poor thing). - You're a scholar? - Tolerably, educated. Oh, fine thing (fine thing). Well, brother, what do you think? Will this gentleman do? Do? Well, yes, brother Charles, he'll do, he'll do. You're offering me work, sirs? Yes, with our nephew in the Counting house--a clerk (a clerk). Do you accept? - Yes, gladly. - Good (good)! Well, that settles it, then (settles it, then). Can you believe they offered me the position there and then? Congratulations! Rejoice, rejoice! Of course, I expected it all along. Why, in a few years time, they will take Nicholas into partnership and he will make his fortune in no time at all. You rang? Stop. I did ring. I knew you did. Then why'd you leave if you knew? Thought you might around...say you didn't. Drunken fool. Are there any letters come? This. Dead? Lord Verisopht? Found--this morning. A duel. - Who with? - Hawk. He's run away, to France. Yes, Verisopht--he owes me money. A fortune, 3,000 pounds. His debts...died with him. Do you have any other family? No, my uncles took me into their charge when I was very young. You must come and meet my mother and sister, when we're settled into proper lodgings. - I'd like that.... Good morning. - Good morning. - Who is that young lady? - Nicholas, a word if you please (if you please). The young lady you saw leave just now-- her name is Miss Madeline Bray. Her dead mother was our dear friend. We have, from time to time, prevailed upon Miss Bray to accept a small amount of money from us-- in secret (in secret, yes). I'm afraid her life is wretched. She's forced to live in the debtors house at King's Bench Prison with her father. The man's a wastrel (a wastrel). Pursued by his creditors. We have offered him charity but his but his selfish pride has refused us (refused us). Miss Bray's destitute? She is (she is). And she cannot leave her father? She will not (will not). We would like to make this offer of money permanent, and we've come to the conclusion that the best way is to make a regular purchase of her little drawings. At a high price of course (of course). We should ask our nephew Frank to help us. He's a fine fellow (fine fellow). But we're afraid he might be too... aaah...flighty (flighty). In such a delicate matter, and fall in love with her. I see. Do you? Then, we trust you will help us, Nicholas. How I was bruised! Wasn't I, little Wackford? Oh, you were, father, from here to there, vinegar and brown paper. Plastered, in a heap on my kitchen floor! You might've thought he was a big, fat parcel! - Huh? - Nothing. Here, make yourself useful. Go and buy something sweet-- a nice, rich tart. What a miracle of high feeding! Thank you, sir. Now, Mr. Squeers, concerning my nephew's behavior, I see you're not ready to forgive and forget? Aye...you'd be right. And if you could, you'd like this stolen boy returned? Get out of my way! Aye, I would like him returned, that's correct. - Tell me, who is he? - I've no idea. The man came asking about him a few weeks back, but nothing came of it. You have no address for him? No, nothing. It could be anybody. Good, I have some information. My nephew and this boy-- they're in London. You're from Yorkshire, I understand, Smike. Yes, ma'am. Have you ever dined with the Grimbles of Grundle Hall? Mother. A very proud man, Sir Thomas Grimble, with six grown-up and most lovely daughters. Look towards the night, my dear. And the finest park in the county, do you know it? No, I don't think I do. Oh what a pity. My dear mother, do you suppose Smike, living at Dotheboys Hall, is likely to receive many invitations from the nobility? - Head up dear. - I don't see why not. - Head down. - When I was at school I always went at least twice a year to the Tooleys at Taunton Vale and they were a great deal richer than the Grimbles of Grundle Hall. Head to the side, my dear. Do you remember much about your family, Smike? No...except, the man that took me, to the school-- he brought me from London. Miss Bray.... What d'you want? Who are you, sir? I'm an art dealer, sir. I'm here to collect two of your daughter's drawings. Madeline, fetch them. Thank you. Open it. See that the money is correct. It's quite right, father, I'm sure. Let me have it here. Is this right? Quite right. Good. Now, ring the bell. Tell them I want some grapes and a newspaper, and some wine, the same as last week, my dear. Yes, father. Perhaps your daughter wants something for herself, sir. It is no matter to you, sir. My daughter requires no kindness from you nor anybody else. Madeleine, give the boy a receipt. Yes, Father. Thank you. When shall I call again? When you I requested to call, sir. Madeline, when is this person to call again? Perhaps in a few more weeks? A few more weeks? Oh, I think not. Then, sooner, sir, if you please. Gladly. We thank you for coming, Mr. Nickleby. But we must disagree (disagree). Your nephew is a noble lad (a noble lad). We find him an honest worker. Then, you have yet to know him, sirs. I think we do know him, sir. Don't you, brother Ned? Most definitely, brother Charles. Is this what you mean by charity, hmm? Employing a boy who's disgraced his family name? - No, Mr. Nickleby, (we prefer to call it) having faith. - Faith? - in one's fellow man (fellow man). - Ha! You hope! - Indeed we do, sir (we do, sir). Men say you are truth itself, sirs. I say you're living under a delusion. Virtuous as you both are, you are not angels, yet. Why do you waste your time pursuing your nephew, Mr. Nickleby? Surely he is the least of your worries. We know of your losses in the city. My financial affairs are my own, gentleman. Good day, Mr. Nickleby. Good day. Thank you for meeting me here. My father's health is much worse today. I didn't want to disturb him. Are you going straight back to him? No, not yet. There are some things I need to buy. May I walk with you, Madeline? Yes, I'd like that very much. Nicholas, when you acted on stage, what parts did you play? Romantic. - You find that amusing. - No... I should like to have seen it. Well, then, you shall-- Soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Madeline is the sun. She laughs! Laugh again, bright angel. Dear Smike...now, you're sure you can manage the London streets? Yes. I want to do it. I need to do it on my own. Very well. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire! Drive off! ... around Smike, Father. I want to, Fanny. And didn't I thump his head, Father? Like that! Like that, good'un, you done slapped him up there! Oh, no! What, now? - Tilda! - Fanny. What are you doing here? We've come to London to enjoy ourselves after our wedding. What about you? Fashion and business, ma'am. I'm afraid I won't be able to see you for a few days. But I is very full with the visiting gentry. Well, girl, I think it's your turn to be married now, and you'd better make haste. Yes, you must. Oh, I'm in no hurry, Tilda. - No, Fanny? - No, Tilda. I can wait. And so could all the young men, it would seem. Oh! Where are you going? I'm going to visit Lady Fairweather. Lady Fairweather. Where does she live? In her head! Hey, Browdie. What do you think-- Who do you suppose we laid our hands on today, hey? Smike! I've got him tied up upstairs inside the wardrobe. Onward, another pint! If you will excuse me, ma'am. Nature, she calls. I've looked everywhere. I can't find him. Remember me, Mr. Nickleby? No. Let me pass. I've been waiting a long time. Really? I hoped you were dead. I need money. Then, work. I possess a hold of you, Nickleby, a secret. I took advantage of my position with you. What assistance can you render me if I tell you? You have money at your side. I have hunger and thirst at mine. You can drive an easy bargain. I will give you nothing. If I die my secret dies with me. Let me tell you what you've lost by my great crime. You are welcome to all you know. I'm threatened every day by one man or another and I do not grow the poorer for it. Good night! Your family-- Are those of the name Nickleby not dear to you? They are not! I will not part with a halfpenny, nor would I, to save you from rotting, Mr.Brooker. We were so worried about you, Smike. Were you? When you didn't come back, we didn't have a moment's peace. Are you finished? Did-- did you think about m-me, Miss? But of course I did, Smike, we all did. Now, rest. What's wrong? You're hiding something. I'm not. Tell me. I can't. I haven't told anybody, Kate. Very well. I think I've fallen in love. In love? My brother's in love? Who is she? Her name is Madeline Bray. Well, mother. What do you think? Your little cottage in Bow. Oh, it's charming! You'll be safe here. Nicholas, you must thank the Cheerybles for their generosity. I don't know how you manage it, Miss Sliderskew. Manage what? Your beauty. It grows more rare each time I visit. - It's a miracle. - Truly. It has a strong fruity flavor-- you won't want any more. Thank you. Thank you for coming to see me so quickly, Mr. Nickleby. - Time is money. - Oh, it is, for those of us who make interest on it. I've heard of many losses in the city. I hope you're not one of them? My money's safe, Mr. Gride. I heard different. Why have you asked me here? Do get to your point, man. What would you say, Mr. Nickleby, if I was to tell you that I'm going to be married? To whom? Some rich old hag? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no-- Wrong! For once, quite out, Mr. Nickleby. Se's a young, beautiful creature with a head of hair that one's fingers just- just itch to play with. What has this to do with me? You remember that charming man who used his wife so ill? - There are many. - Oh, yes... This one owes you money-- 975 pounds 4 shillings and threepence. Walter Bray? Ha, ha, ha, ha, I knew you wouldn't forget him. He's old, now. He has a daughter, Madeline Bray. You must know her? A certain young man who bears your name visits her often? Go on. I want you to go and talk to the father for me. You can press a point better than most. I'm such a timid, old creature. What is there to recommend you, Mr. Gride? The moment I am married, I will dissolve him of all his debts and give him a yearly allowance to live like a gentleman. But, I need your help. You are Mr. Bray's main creditor. - Mmm hmm. - What would you want-- How much would you take for me to buy his debt? I could go as high as...800 pounds for a friend, such as you. There is more to tell me, isn't there? Would I deceive you, Mr. Nickleby? The pygmy impose upon the giant? Yes. Oh, very well. Then, supposing I-- I told you that I had knowledge of some properties. See here, I have a-a, a will. This property shall be mine if I succeed in marrying the daughter. - I found it among Bray's papers. - Found? Very well. I want the whole amount-- my debt, in full. And five hundred pounds. - You agree? - Of course I agree. Why shouldn't I? You're my friend, Arthur. This is an offer of marriage that many a titled father would leap at for his child. Mr. Gride, here, has the fortune of a prince. And my daughter, is a princess, sir. Precisely. A marriage made in heaven. He has money and she has-- Beauty! I'm not sure. It's for my daughter to make up her own mind. True. You still have the parental power to advise, to hint a wish. Do you think that I'm a broken spirit without the courage to do what is best for my only child? Let me tell you, gentlemen, there was a time when I had power and wealth, and I demanded respect. You are a man still qualified to shine in society, sir. Freedom, with an allowance to support you in luxury, transform your life. Yes, a new existence. Look at him sir. He's old. He will die soon, and your daughter will be a rich widow. Hark! I hear her coming. Father? It's nothing, my dear. A sudden spasm, my dear. Goodbye, gentlemen. Mr. Bray, I hope to hear from you very soon. One week? Yes, give me a week. Shake the gentlemens' hands, Madeline. - Good day to you, ma'am. - Good day, sir. Goodbye, my dear. Good day, gentlemen. Young, loving, and fair. Oh what happiness there! The bottle green jacket, Peg. I'll woo her in bottle green. It's a good'n-- Got it cheap at a pawn broker's. It's too good to be wooing in, master. Haven't you got anything else? It's a pity to waste it. No, no, no, no--I want to look handsome for the wooing. If she's as handsome as you say, she won't look much at you, master. - Why not? - She might be sick. You're in a funny humor, ain't you Peg? Isn't all this wooing enough to make me? 'Cause if you get married, I might be put out onto the street. Oh, Peg. I would never do that to you, Peg. Wouldn't you? Why not? I could never afford to. Your services, they come cheap, hey? - Door. - What? The door--answer it. Oh, what happiness there! - What do you want? - Mr. Gride. - What? Who? - Gride. Gride. I've got an urgent letter from Mr. Ralph Nickleby. Oh. Come up. Ah, Mr. Nobbs, come in, come in, come, come in. Answer. Bearer waits. Is it bad news? I'll pen a line. Do you see anything in particular, Mr. Noggs? Only a cobweb...with a fly in it. Oh, yes. There're a good many flies in here... And a spider. What did he say, master? The father does not object. I will be married soon, Peg! Now let me think. What shall I write? I think... My answer is yes. Where's Nicholas? Where's Nicholas? - I'll go straight to Bray. - It won't suit, sir. Well, then, I'll go to my uncle. What good would that do? He hates you. Where are the brothers? Is there any chance of them being here tonight? Impossible, the brothers are abroad on business. Well, then, I'll talk to Madeline myself. I've got to stop her, Newman! - Madeline, please. I beg you to listen! - I've heard enough, sir. Can't you see, she doesn't need you anymore. Our lives have changed. Tomorrow, we leave this place. So this is the independence of a man who-- - Nicholas! - Of a man who would sell his own daughter? - Madeline. - For heaven's sake, sir, he's ill. Yes, am ill. And I am being bullied by a shop boy. Madeline, I will not allow you to be forced into this fixed marriage. You have been bought and sold for the love of money. It's my duty, sir. And I will perform it. No, you won't! - Father, father, father. - Let go of her, let go! Madeline, Madeline! Nicholas, stop. Let me go. You can't go through with this, Madeleine. Please. I won't pretend that I'm not in great pain, Nicholas. Of course I don't love this gentleman, Mr. Gride. But don't you see that by accepting him I can release my father, who is dying in this place. I can prolong his life, perhaps for many years. What about your life? The feelings you've shown for me-- I will never forget. But I cannot change my mind. If circumstances were different.... I'm sorry. I must go to him. Is there nothing more I can do? At least wait until the brothers return. I can't. Why not? I'm to be married tomorrow morning. Hail to the beau, happy of a- now going this morning to his bridal day. Loud trumpets blow, bells gaily ring-- What's that? Your wedding dinner. What do you think? Is it small and skinny enough for ya? Oh, it's beautiful. Good. Now don't you complain of the expense afterwards. Oh, we have to live expensive for the first week, Peg-- to keep my bride happy. After that we can make economies. Loud trumpets blow, Bells gaily ring, As we together... It seems a cruel thing. What seems a cruel thing? Don't ask me what! This marriage. You know quite as well as I do. Look at him. Does it not seem cruel? No. She's coming. She's coming! She's coming. She's coming! Nicholas Nickleby! I might have known. Good morning, uncle. Uncle? Who, who, who are these people, Nickleby? This fellow here, I'm grieved to say, is my late brother's son. He brings with him his sister, like a cowardly boy tied to his mother's apron strings. I'm not here to speak with either of you. - Madeline. - Leave me. See? Do you hear? Do you hear what she says? - Madeline. - Go. My father is dead. - Dead! - No! - Father. - Do something, Nickleby. This man claims his wife and he shall have her. - Why? Because her father owes him money? - It's too late, uncle, look. Oh, no, no, no, no, Madeline, come to me. Stay away. Oh, Miss Bray.... - Madeline. - Father, father. - Stay where you are. - Father. - Come back here. - No, no. Come back here, I say! Never. ..come be my beautiful bride. Nickleby...the money...our beautiful money. You talk, Mr. Nickleby, as if I am to blame for the loss of your money. I blame the girl's father for not living one hour longer, no one else. Well, what's to be done? Presently, the money is of no importance. First, I have a score to settle with that nephew of mine. Yes, the will-- the property... If he marries Miss Bray, he will get the-- He will get nothing. Fetch that will, we must destroy it. Go on, man. - Robbed. - What? What is it, man? My papers. The will. She saw me put them in this box. Peg! - She's stolen it. - Damnation. - That's not what it is. - Why not? 'Cause she can't read. We must be quick, Mr. Nickleby, before somebody tells her. We can't afford to be found out. We don't want the law after us. - Patience, Mr. Gride. - (...money, money...) There was a time when nothing could have moved me more - than the loss of my money. - (...money, money, money, money...) - I swear, I hate him more. - (...money, money--Damn you! Money, money, money...) You let me deal with him. He won't get the better of me. - I'll settle with him, once and for all. - (...money, money--) Revenge! But why is such a great fuss made because Miss Madeline is going to marry somebody older than herself? Your papapa was older than I. Four-and-a-half years older. I don't think you quite understand, mama. I understand perfectly, Kate. Oh, Mr. Cheeryble, how nice to see you. Good afternoon, ladies. How is she? She's sleeping. I was very impressed, Miss Nickleby, The way you helped your brother. - Thank you. - Very impressed. I'm sure we've done the right thing. I don't suppose you'd like to join me for a walk, Miss Nickleby? I'll watch over Madeline, my dear. Yes, Mr. Cheeryble, I would. You would? Oh, good. Well, Squeers, how do you do? I'm pretty well, sir, apart of a sort of rash. How unfortunate. Let's talk business. Noggs. Noggs! Get back to the office. My dinner time. Your time is my time. Be gone, sir. I have reason to suspect that fellow. I suspect everybody nowadays, sir, including the wife. What were you gonna say, sir? I have more business for you concerning my nephew. Ah. I hope it doesn't involve a risk. Not like the last one. There's no risk, Mr. Squeers, and may I remind you that that business came about to repay a hurt that was done you. Uh-huh. And because you had a grudge to satisfy. I spend money to gratify my hatred. You pocket it to gratify yours. Who is the richer? What do you want? There is a will. It favors a young girl who my nephew has an affection for. If he should marry her, he becomes entitled to property. Now, the will has been stolen by an old crone called Sliderskew. Peg Sliderskew. I want you to acquaint yourself with her, retrieve the will, and bring it to me. How much will you pay me? - Fifty pounds. - Seventy-five. Fifty. Seventy-five. Very well. Thank you for everything, Nicholas. I've done nothing I didn't want to, sir. - Goodbye, Nicholas. - Goodbye, Madeline. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, ma'am. Goodbye. What will you do? What can I do, Kate? If I declare my feelings for Madeline, the Cheerybles may think I've taken advantage of their trust. The situation is hopeless. They are rich and we are poor. Nicholas, come quickly. He's been staying indoors for days, doctor. I told him to go out for a walk, but he wouldn't. or he couldn't and, now, well... - Mr. Nickleby, are you free to travel? - Why? The boy should be taken from London at once--cleaner air. Will he get any better? I'm afraid your friend is very ill. This used to be my home. Home. I was happy here, Smike. We used to play here as children. Once, when Kate was little we lost her, and after searching for hours, we found her sleeping under this tree. Now it shades my father's grave. Oh! What's wrong? Ah, yes.... there, in the trees. What is it? He's, he's the man.... There.... Watching. There's nobody there. Smike? Always...remember... You...made me...happy. And you, me, Smike. May.... May I tell you... my secret? Of course. I couldn't help it. I know he loves her, but... Kate? I loved her. Is that you, my lover? Aye, it's me, my little hot combustion flame. What? I said I've never seen such an ugly toad in all my life. Oh, oh, flattery. Don't say such things. Cheers. Thank you. The last one was the first one of the day. I can tell. Oh, you frightened me, sir. It's a startling thing for a stranger to say I know all about you. We were destined to meet, Peg. - It was in the stars. - In the stars. Oh, in the stars. Say it again. What do you see in the stars? Gride. He wasn't live. No, not married? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. That miserly old goat. I've got my hands on what he wants. - Show me. - No. - Let me see. - Oh, you're tickling me. Oh, you're tickling me. Oh, you're tickling me. Lover.... Wha, wha, what do you see? Won't you mouth the words, Mr. Squeers.? Go on, wretch! Lover.... Lover. Mr. Squeers, come with me. Is your brother home? Who are you? - Ah, so you're come at last, sir. - They can't hurt you, man. No, they can't. I was merely employed by a friend. - Mr. Ralph Nickleby of Golden Square! - You must trust me. You shall have an action for false imprisonment. I'll devise a story and if they want security, a thousand pounds, even, you shall have it. - But tonight youre a bit fuddled. - Fuddled? Tomorrow morning, this is what you must do. Oh, no. I've let you lead me on, from one thing to another. And now look at me-- Here, in shame. Do you hear me, Nickleby? Everybody hears you, Squeers. Listen, there are rumors about me in the city. I have mounting debts. We must help each other! - Squeers? - Help yourself! Squeers! - What's going on? - You have a visitor. What are you doing here? - Get out. Both of you. - Listen to me, uncle. - I know something that concerns you. - Something dreadful. What's this? Who's there? What's this man doing here? Hmm? He's a convict and a thief. - Hear him, uncle. - No, sir. Yes, sir! Please begin, Mr. Brooker. - There was a boy...your son. - I have no son. Yes, you had. You once were married, uncle. Is that true? Well, tell him, Nickleby. He married his wife for profit. And there was a child. Yes, a boy. He and his wife lived apart, she, alone in the country, he, in London, doing business. She was alone. Yes, I left her alone. And she eloped...with a younger man. What is the point of this? You had me bring the boy to London and lodge him in the front garret of your house. Neglect had made the boy ill, but after a few weeks you went away, on business. Six weeks you were gone, I remember. And when you came back, I told you...your son was dead. Yes, you did. He wasn't. I heard of a school in Yorkshire run by a man called Squeers. I took the boy there. Later, I was going to resurrect him for you-- Get some of your money! But I'd been arrested, on another matter, and transported for some years. I just got back. I sought you out! I hinted what I might tell you-- my great secret. And I only asked for a little money. But you refused me. I was desperate. Your clerk found me and gave me a pittance. And told me of your nephew, Nicholas Nickleby. The boy Mr. Brooker stole from you and left in a school in Yorkshire-- that boy was Smike. Smike? I don't believe you. Where is he? Let me see him. - You can't. - Why not? He's dead. Smike died a few days ago. Smike. Oh, my god. Uncle. Spare a coin, sir? Please, sir. Mr. Ralph Nickleby. Mr. Ralph Nickleby. Ralph Nickleby. Ralph Nickleby. I can't live without her, Kate. I try to imagine the time when I may be able to support her, but that day seems so far off. You may grow rich, you know. Yes, I may grow old. I have something I must tell you, Nicholas. While you were away, Frank Cheeryble asked me to marry him. And? Like you, I don't want to offend the Cheerybles. They've done so much for us, and...they will expect Frank to marry someone with money. Don't you love him? Yes. Come, come, my dear sir. We must not be cast down, no no. We must learn to bear misfortune. Yes, I suppose we must. Tell me, Nicholas. Have you seen anything of Miss Bray lately? I haven't seen her for some time, Mr. Cheeryble. What a pity. Why ever not? Well, then you won't know of her good fortune. Miss Bray has become entitled to a good sum of money and property worth-- Twelve thousand pounds. Her grandfather's stolen will, yes. Quite a dowry, don't you think? I hope it will make her very happy, Mr. Cheeryble. Good, because here she comes. You have offended me, sir. Offended you? My nephew Frank tells me of a letter sent, stating why you and your sister cannot see him or Madeline. That letter was private, sir. Mr. Nickleby, you did not violate the confidence we placed in you. Nor taken unworthy advantage of it. We are sure you did not (did not). I told you once, if circumstances were different-- Well, they are different now, Nicholas. Not for me. - I have nothing I can offer you, Madeline. - Except yourself. I don't know what to say. Say you feel the same? I do.... I love you. I love you, Nicholas Nickleby. And when her term of mourning had ended, I offered Madeline my hand. And on the same day, and at the same time amongst our family and friends, my dear sister Kate agreed to marry Mr. Frank Cheeryble. The weddings were held near our family home at the little church in Devonshire. The money from Madeline's inheritance was invested well, in the firm of the Cheeryble brothers. Frank became a partner, and soon the business was known as Cheeryble and Nickelby. My future prospered, and I was able to buy the childhood home where we'd spent many tender years. We all lived close to Smike's grave, and would often sit and remember our dear cousin. He was never forgotten. At last we could be truly happy.
