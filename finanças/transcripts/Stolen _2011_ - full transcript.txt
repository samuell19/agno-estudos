We've got another one, an African girl straight off the plane, no identification, been told what to say and do. You need to see her. Hello, I'm Anthony. Rosemary. Can you tell me who gave you these coins? Shall I tell you what I think happened? I think someone put you on an aeroplane in Lagos, and you've torn up your passport and your tickets and thrown them into the toilet. You're not in any trouble, not with me, not with Sonia. Can I see your arm? Will you show me your arm, please? Show me your arm. Thank you. They must have really hurt you when they took your blood and told you to swear. You're a very brave girl. Have they put juju on you, Rosemary? And your family? Have they told you bad things will happen unless you keep everything secret? Unless you make your phone call? They were telling lies. You're safe here with us, Rosemary. Are you the policeman? Oh it's so beautiful, look at this, look at this! -Hello. -Georgie, stop. [speaking in foreign language] We are nice English family. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [phone ringing] Hello? [speaking in foreign language] See, a seat. Sit down. Don't worry. Don't worry, it will be better. [speaking in foreign language] [Anthony] Here, come on. [rings doorbell] Hello. Hi. -This is Rosemary and Anthony. -Hello, Rosemary. Come in. Rosemary, I'll show you where you'll be sleeping. You must be very tired. Do you want to follow me? Come on. Keisha? [Keisha] What? This is Rosemary. Is she foreign? She's gonna be staying with us for a couple of days, okay? Another one? Rosemary, this is your room. Okay? I'll be back in a minute. [Anthony] Is the girl any trouble? [April] Keisha? She's fine. She's been in care half her life, we allow her the odd strop. [Anthony] Does she have a key? [April] Yeah. Okay, when Rosemary's in the house, I always want the doors locked. Okay? I want all mobile phones out of sight at all times. She's my only link to the trafficker and I do not want to lose her. Then put a policeman on the door. As far as security goes, April, you're it. Thanks. See you. Thanks, Sonia. [melodious instrumental music] What have we got? Fall out from a domestic, boyfriend claims his girlfriend is illegal and a tart, his words. Anything else? He was worse for wear, let's say, she wouldn't let him in. [knocks] Hello, there. Police. Can we come in, please? Is this about last night? It's connected to what happened last night, yes. Your boyfriend will be appearing in court this morning. Can we come in? Do you mind if we have a look around? Look around? [Anthony] Yeah. Is that a problem? Look for what? Are you in this country legally, Miss? I am studying to be a nurse. Can we see your passport, please? Your passport. I have lost it. Maybe we can we help you find it? We won't make a mess, I promise. Do you mind? You're Portuguese, Anna? Yes. Looks like a genuine blank, content's a good forgery. D'you hear that? Forgery, no. No, it's not possible. It's a fact, Anna, I'm looking at a fake passport. No, I am a student. I can show you my books, I will be a nurse! Miss Costa, we believe your passport to be forged, therefore, we suspect you of entering this country illegally. [Man] D'you want to stand up for me? [Woman] Stand. [Man] Just take a look at you, okay? Can you just turn around? Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. She looks healthy. I think we can do a bit better on the price. [Woman] He wants the money. He agreed on the price. Okay? [speaking in foreign language] [mellow instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] What to do with the boy now? [speaking in foreign language] He needs a job. Nyet. Come on, George. These dirty bastards, they've been treating this place like a shithole. Now I need someone that I can trust. Do you understand trust? Yeah. Do you understand? -Do you understand? -Yes. Yes, boss. I'm giving you an opportunity, Georgie. Yes. A chance to earn some real money. Yes, boss. And just maybe, Georgie, if you work hard... Yes. You might wind up with a car like mine. [mellow guitar music] I don't need all this mess, George, do you understand? I need for it to be clean and tidy. I need the floor swept, I need the washing done, I need it sorted. Washing machine, dryers are over there. You make sure their clothes are clean. You'll be sleeping here with the rest of them. Yeah? You understand? Yeah, boss. You'll be paying me to stay here and you'll pay me for the grub I give you. Keep everything clean. I don't want it smelling like this. Do you understand, George? Yes, I work. [woman singing] Come on in. [speaking in foreign language] ["The Beginning" by Jammer] [speaking in foreign language] Kim Pak? Kim Pak? Have you been smoking all my profit again? Kim Pak! [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] I need to get out of here. [melodious instrumental music] [rap music on headphones] Rosemary, come on. Rosemary, come on back to bed. You can't leave, it's the middle of the night, come on. Would you like a glass of water? What's going on? Go back to bed, Keisha. April, what's going on? [April] It's the middle of the night, you can't go out there, you've got to come back to bed. If she wants to go, just let her go. Keisha, you're not helping me, please go back to bed! Can't you see I can't sleep and I can't cos she's making noise! [Rosemary] No! If she wants to go out, open the door and let her out! Back to bed now! -No! -It's all about her, isn't it? You don't care about me, do you? Please, Rosemary! Look at me. No! Rosemary, look at me, please. Are you okay? You're safe. [melodious foreign music] I need to borrow some cash. Just a tenner, is that okay? It's in my wallet. Thanks, hun. I'm going to be so late. [Alison] Hey, what's this photograph? [Anthony] Work. What's it doing in your wallet? [Anthony] Just keeping it safe. Please, don't bring it home. This isn't home. You know what I mean. Alison, it's just a photograph. [Alison] No, it's a child with a name. -[phone ringing] -What's her name? Rosemary. I think you were better off in vice. Carter. Hi, it's April Harris. Rosemary tried to run from the house last night. She's absolutely terrified. I can't keep her here, if she tries to leave again... You know, I'm not her jailer, Anthony, I'm sorry. April, you're all we've got. You're all I've got, okay? You've got to do everything you can to hold on to her. All right? I've got to go. That girl in the photo, she tried to run. Love you! [Anthony] Get dressed. -Okay. -Get dressed. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about the flat. It's fine. See you tonight. [speaking in foreign language] -[Georgie] Wash? -[speaking in foreign language] [Georgie] Dirty clothes? I help you wash, free wash. [speaking in foreign language] No, no. I help you, I help you, free wash. Do you hear? Free! There is nothing for free. [speaking in foreign language] But it's my job, it is all what I have. I fuck your job. Hey, Danny, what's up with you, he's just a boy! Make your fucking business, okay? Fuck you. No, fuck you, son of a bitch! [laughter] Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny, come on. Come on, man, calm down. Fuck you, son of a bitch! [laughter] It's not worth it. I will wash my clothes by myself. Come on, sit down. [Georgie] Wash? Wash? [speaking in foreign language] It is always morning here. [speaking in foreign language] Come, off to work. [Anthony] Who are you? I'm a student. I will soon be a nurse, an asset. Your name's Kadisha Kosh, and you're in this country illegally. You're from East Africa, Somalia. Your letters, from home, from Somalia, found here at your flat. [Kadisha] You are wrong. We can prove it. Then prove it. I have friends in Germany, does that make me German? I'm told you have scars, on your arm. Were you trafficked? Don't lie to me, Kadisha Kosh, I know you were trafficked. You've made a life for yourself, which tells me you're brave, strong. Her name is Rosemary. She was brought into the country yesterday, she needs your strength. I have nothing to say. [Anthony] She tried to run away last night, make her phone call. Do you want this little girl to go through what you've been through? You know nothing about my life. My name is Anna Costa, I have nothing more to say. May I go to my class? [Woman] All right. Okay. That's fine. It has to be a girl. She has to be hard-working, no older than 14. Girls are in demand. Girls are more readily available. I know this. I happen to have just what you need. One payment, £5,000. It's too much. [Thomas] It's a fair price. Too much. I could really sell the girl for £10,000 here in England, in Italy, Ireland. If I advertise that she is a virgin, I can sell her for £50,000. But I'm not a pimp, I'm a businessman. And this girl is special, obedient, strong, healthy. Hungry. I would like to see this excellent girl with a good family. You have a big heart, Mr. Ekoku. Grace... For the right girl, I will pay half that amount. £4,000 is my lowest price, you will understand, the risks are too great for anything less. Too much. Then I walk away. £4,000, my final price. Michael, take note. [Michael] Yes. Well, it's best I go. Grace, no open door. Excuse me. [speaking in foreign language] Ready? Mm-hmm. Bring all your dolls. Have you got them all? Yeah. Good girl. [car alarm locks] This is great, this is gonna be your first play date. Here we go. [rings doorbell] And be nice. I am nice. She's upstairs. Rosemary! Come down. Hello, Rosemary. Are you going to say hi? Hi. [Anthony] This is Ellie, my daughter, she's come to have a play. Are you gonna show all your toys? They're not toys! [Anthony] Sorry, sorry. Your dolls. This is Molly and this is Natasha. Do you want to dress her? Here. You could try. It must have been a hell of a fight between the father and the policeman. I just hope you know what you're doing. I need to know who was on that plane with her. I'm told the traffickers know the house of every carer in the borough. Did you know that? Yeah. I didn't. It's really pretty. Do you want to feel her hair? Do you want it? Here you go. It's really nice on you. It can be our little friendship bracelet. And I'll have mine on and that'll mean we'll stay friends forever. Girl. Miss! You live here? Who's asking? The Queen of England. I might do. You might do? Yeah. Who do you live there with, huh? A little foreign girl. A little foreign girl? Mm-hmm. [Michael] What does she look like? She's little. Little... She's foreign. Yes? And she's a girl. Thank you. Okay, this is a fun game. This is called Name the Face. Okay? Okay I put a picture down and you've got to tell me who it is. -Okay. -Are you ready? Fingers on buzzers, please, okay, let's go. Dad! Name? Dad! That's right, D-A-D, Dad. Barney! Barney, we love Barney. Her, it's her! Cat's mother? What's her name? April. Good girl. April. Good girl, Rosemary. [Ellie] Nelson! Mr. Mandela to you, young lady. [Ellie] Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me! -It's me! -Me, me, me, me. [Anthony] What's your name? Ellie! Ellie, good girl, that's two to Rosemary. Very good, Rosemary. Erm, Dad, another one. Pingu! Rosemary? Are you feeling okay? Do you know who this is? I can help you, Rosemary. Dad, why aren't we moving? Hey, babe, we're back! How was your day? Mommy! Did you miss us? [Alison] Where have you been? [Anthony] I told you we'd be late. [Alison] Your mobile's switched off. [Anthony] No, it's on now. We've been playing with Rosemary, haven't we, Dad? [Anthony] Yeah. [Alison] Rosemary? [Anthony] It's not a big deal. [Alison] Is that the girl from the photograph? [Anthony] Ali, it's not a big deal. Okay? It was a last-minute decision. She enjoyed it! She's really nice. She enjoyed it. What in the name of God are you playing at? Hey, let's go next door. Put the telly on, okay? I'll bring you a cookie in a minute, close the door. What? The playmate you've chosen for Ellie is somebody's idea of how to make money. What if they were watching the house? [Anthony] They weren't. What if they saw Ellie and thought, she's nice. That's ridiculous! You think so? She was safe. You used her. We agreed you'd never bring this home and you have. Come on, then! Let's be having you, let's get to work, come on! Hey, not you, Danny. Stay there, Dan. Georgie, come on, mate, we'll earn some money tonight. Let's go to work. Come on, boy. Come. Too much mouth, Danny! Put them down there and get your wellies on. [speaking in foreign language] Georgie, wipe down the tables, boy. [Georgie] Right. I got it here. [loud banging] Kim Pak? Kim Pak? [speaking in foreign language] Kim Pak? [speaking in foreign language] [laughs] [speaking in foreign language] [screams with excitement] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Let me out! [speaking in foreign language] Let me out! [speaking in foreign language] Let me out! [speaking in foreign language] [car crashes] [speaking in foreign language] Oi! What are you playing at? You could have killed us! Stay there! I'll call the police. Stay there. Stay there! Hey! No police! No police! No police. No police. No phone. No police. Okay. [speaking in foreign language] [siren wailing] Just try not to panic. [Ellie] Basil. [Anthony] Basil, go on then, tear off some basil. What's the matter with cheesy beans? That's what I want. [Alison] Lots of chilli, please. -[phone rings] -[Anthony] Chilli. Oh, my God. Oh, dear, I can't eat all that chilli. Carter. Does he speak English? So we don't need a translator? Okay, I'll see you soon. Hi, Sonia. Sorry, they called me. I told them to call you. So his name is Kim Pak. He's given no address, no next of kin, no contacts. Found these on him. Hello, Kim Pak. How are you feeling? If you send me to Vietnam, they will kill me. Who will kill you? Gangster. Who are the gangsters? Who brought you into the country, Kim Pak? You probably have cannabis in your blood. You have cannabis in your pockets. If you aren't prepared to tell me where you've been, what you've been doing and who you have been working for, all I see is a criminal. Just go home now, I need to go to sleep. Kim Pak, you're too young to be alone without any friends, you have to trust somebody. Don't go too far now, Rosemary. That's nice. It's like a little person, isn't it? Shall we have some peas? [rap music on headphones] [knocks] [rings doorbell] Wait there, Rosemary. Who is it? Who is it? Madam, I am looking for my niece. I think she might be staying with you. She made a promise she would call. Rosemary, go back into the kitchen. -Go back! -Hello? [April] You have the wrong house. Can I speak with your husband, please? I said you have the wrong house. One minute of his time. April? What's going on? Keisha, go back upstairs. Who is it? [April] Go into your room, okay? What does he want? I don't know. I said you have the wrong house. And now I'm calling the police! That is a pity. You see, my niece, she swore an oath. She made a promise she would call. Her family will be worried. They will be frightened. Get away from my house now! I'm calling the police! Go! Go! [Keisha] What's going on? Keisha, please go up stairs. What does he want? I'm gonna find out. Please go to your room and stay there. Please! I need a reason not to lock him up. Well, he's afraid. I need him to give me that reason. Just give him time, please. Okay. He's 16, he's a minor, he might be in need of further medical attention, he has to be in a hospital or Social. Yeah. Okay? Sonia, you need to let me know where he is and warn him he needs to talk. Thanks, Anthony. [cellphone rings] Okay. Carter. It's April. Yeah. I've had a visitor. Is he still there? I think he's gone. Rosemary? What? April, what is it? Oh, my God! April, is she still there? April, is she still there? Tell me she's still there. I'm just checking the back. Rosemary? The gate's open. I locked the gate. Rosemary! April, is she still there? Rosemary! I can't see her. Rosemary! Anthony, I'm sorry. She's gone. I'll find her. [heavy breathing] [phone ringing] Who is this? This is Rosemary. I have the name of the road for you. [Anthony] Do you know him? [Kadisha] Am I supposed to know every black man in the city? He's a trafficker. Do you remember that little girl I told you about? Rosemary? She's gone. She ran. Maybe to him. Look, I know what it cost you to get that passport, maybe the best five years of your life. And all those men. And I'm sorry, but it begins with someone like him. It begins with the demand. He is the supply. Economics. So you do know him? What about me? Can you help me? All I can promise you is that I'll inform the Home Office that you co-operated with the investigation. That's, that's the best I can do. Do you know him? No. But I can tell you about the girl. That's his daughter. You don't think so? She's afraid. She's hiding underneath that hat. She's pretending to be older than she is, with the high shoes, the clothes. I think she is stolen. Come! Any problems, you know where to find me, and when she gets a little older, when she looks more like a woman, maybe I'll take her back. Look at me. Work hard, like I told you. Is that you? I think so, yes. And the girl? Serena, my daughter. Can I talk to Serena? Why? Why, is it a problem if I want to talk to her? Exactly. Is there a problem? You tell me. Serena! Hello, Serena. I'm gonna ask you a question. Do you know this little girl? No. I have never seen her before. Never. Who did you visit in Lagos? My grandmother, my aunties and some clients with my father. Serena is learning the business. Can you tell me who this man is? It is my father, not a very good picture. [Thomas] Not a good picture of me nor you, Serena. Thanks. [speaking in foreign language] No problem. Now, if you will excuse me, I believe our business here is finished. [Grace] Make sure you finish before you come out here. [David] It's done. So now you have a house-girl. Grace, you know we have children to take care of, businesses to run, and you are pregnant. [Grace] I don't want it in this house. [David] You just have to be patient with her. You, go through. [Grace] Is she clean? [David] What? [Grace] Is she clean? Does she have lice, infection? [David] Listen, I am trying to talk to you. [Grace] I am listening to you talk. [David] Wait. Grace, she is necessary. [Grace] Ah-ah! What do you mean? This is not Nigeria, my friend. You are not a politician, you are an ordinary man. [David] Grace, take it easy. [Grace] I don't want her sleeping on my sofa. [David] Fine! Listen, I'm trying to talk to you. [Grace] I'm listening to you talk! [David] Wait. [Grace] Hah? What country is this? Is you're bringing another person into this house! [David] We shouldn't be doing this in front of the children anyway. All right, Sean? Yes, boss. Thank you. Thank you. What about me, boss? Not this time, George, eh? Maybe next week. [Georgie] Next week? Maybe. I work hard, I work all this week! Maybe, eh? Maybe. [Sean] He has worked hard. Shut it, Sean! You got something to say to me, say it in private! All I'm saying is he's worked hard for you. I work in the house! I work in the factory! I work hard for you! George, you've said enough. Leave it. So is there anything you want to tell me? About this place? Anything at all? What about the other boy? There was another boy in the car, when you crashed. Is he happy, do you think? Is he safe? He will not be killed. No, but you will. Yes. By gangsters. Okay, this is my home. This is where I work. Why escape? Why run? If you knew they would kill you, why risk it? There must have been a reason. I wanted to sleep. To sleep in the dark. [David] Take it easy. [Grace] It's you she gets it from. [David] Ah, she doesn't get it from me! It's your dad she gets it from. Why are you teaching him that? [laughter] Did you wash your hands? Yes, miss. Did you scrub them? Properly, with soap? Yes, miss. Do it again. Eat your food now and stop playing. Manda? It's Thomas Ekoku and his daughter. Look at her shoes. Heels. So? And she comes to just below his shoulder. But the Serena we saw came to his shoulder at least. In flats Different girls. The girl in the cap, the girl you passed off as your daughter. Who is she? My daughter. Where is she? Sold? At home. How much did you get for Rosemary, when you sold her? This is nonsense. I have no idea what you're talking about. Who! I am talking about two little girls, one of them called Rosemary. Tiny, frightened little children that you brought into this country and sold. You are mistaken. I'm not a trafficker. No, that's right. What you are is a slaver. A piece of shit. If you have any further questions, perhaps it is best I have my lawyer present. But I will say one more thing. These "pieces of shit" you are talking about, are the English men, the Italian men, the Germans, the Spanish, the French, all of these educated, greedy Europeans gladly pay money to abuse young African girls, without ever asking who they are or where they are from. I have done nothing wrong. I'm a hard-working British citizen. I'm not a trafficker or a slaver. I'm not a piece if shit, and I'm not a man you can push around. I've no intention of pushing you around, but I will lock you up. You have upset my children, Mr. Carter. You have upset my little girl. I believe you too have a little girl. It is so hard to keep them safe. Kids, come on. It's your fault. Stop all this arguing. Now, let's go, let's go. Precious, Precious, you have your form for your teacher? [Precious] Yes. Yeah? -[Kid] It's your fault... -We are always late. Okay, I have got the keys now. Miss, when can I go to school? [Grace] Keep off the balcony and keep away from the windows. I want to go to school. [Grace] I think you heard what I said. [speaking in foreign language] Georgie. Come on, George. Come on, boy, come with me. Come on, son. You said I could trust you, Georgie. Yes, boss, you can trust me. What's this, Georgie? It was you, wasn't it? It was you, Georgie. "I work for no money"? I trusted you, Georgie. Now I've got no money. Luka, take his clothes! -No! -Take his shoes. Take his jacket. Hand it over, Georgie. [Georgie] No! Fuck! Knows his sandwiches? Get out of here, Georgie! Live on the streets where you belong! Why are you looking? All I want to have a job! I want to have a life like you! I want to have a good life! I want the chance to have a good job! I want to have money, to give for my mom. [crying] Mama. Mama, Mama! Mom. [crying] [coughs] Go! Come on, you rich people, come on. [kids laughing] You... You have all... You have all nice... [Woman] Georgie? [Georgie] Mama? [speaking in foreign language] Stab wound to the stomach. He was found there this morning so he could have been there some time. That was found on him. Thanks. [TV] This four-bedroom house needs quite a lot of work before... Hey, Kim Pak. You okay? I don't know what's going to happen next. There's a chance you could be taken out of here. Put into a young offenders' institution. Prison. You might stay in prison. They might send you back to Vietnam. Right now, you could pack your bag and walk out the door. Disappear, to another city to a place where you could sleep safely. You're a survivor, Kim Pak, you could do that. Yeah. If you do walk out the door I will not come to find you. I'm too busy. [speaking in foreign language] Excuse me, girl. What do you think you're doing? Come here. Hm? I said, what do you think you are doing? Can you remove that, please? What kind of nonsense? You think you're... Can you take this off? Goodness me. What do you mean by this? Give me this. What nonsense! You think you're something special? Who told you could wear my children's clothes? Come out from here! What do you mean? Come out from this place! Who told you could wear my children's clothes? What do you think you are? Come out from here! I said move, huh? Move, shift! Nonsense, stupid, rubbish girl. Eh? Come out from here. And stay down. I don't want anybody seeing your stupid head. Get down there! Naughty girl. [door closes] [David] Where are the children? I left them with Joyce. [David] Joyce? The children are not going back here until that girl has left this house. Where's the girl? She's outside. Outside where? Outside on the balcony. Please. I don't want her in this house, please. I want her gone. I don't want her touching my children, my clothes, my furniture, nothing! I want her gone! [David] She cost us 4,000. [Grace] I don't care about the money. I can smell her all over my furniture. I want her gone. Please, I don't care where, I just want her gone! Okay. Girl, this is where you'll be living now and working. Listen, do not touch anything, do you understand? Nothing. [ominous instrumental music] [intercom buzzes] Hello? Hello. You are alone, yes? Who is this? Someone who knows you are alone. Dad? [Anthony] Yeah? Dad. Dad. What is it? Ellie, get in the car! [cellphone rings] Yeah. Hello, darling. [Man] Excuse me! [Thomas] You have to do your own business. That's... Listen, you... Go anywhere near my family and the moment you're locked up, before you even get to court, I will have you dealt with. That's not a threat, that is a promise! I'll call you back. I don't blame you for being angry. You're a father. Don't you dare. Have I made myself clear? Have I made myself clear? You have made yourself abundantly clear that all you really care about is yourself and your family. We are the same. [cellphone ringing] Carter. We've got something. A telephone message. It was left on the mobile we cloned of Thomas Ekoku. Listen to this. It is David. My wife, she, isn't happy with our recent purchase. I would like to return it as quickly as possible. Not for all of the money but for at least half. I know you can sell her on, so please, no arguments about the fee, no games. "I know you can sell her on." [Anthony] Have you got the caller's number? A phone box, Upper Road, just off Oxford Road. It's loaded with traffic cameras. We've got him. I'm gonna look inside, you stay here out the front. Rosemary! What are you doing? Police. Rosemary. Go, go, go, go. Rosemary. Rosemary! Rosemary! Go. Run, Run! Rosemary! Rosemary, stay there, don't move. She's just a child! [Man] You know nothing! [Anthony] Stand back from the door, stand back! [Man] This is my premises! Did you see her? She came out of here, did you see her? No! She'll call. Oh, fuck! She'll call. [Woman] Is very cheapest one, is very cheapest one. [phone rings] [Rosemary] Hello, Mister. This is Rosemary. I have the name of the road for you. Let's go. [phone rings] Hello? Hello? Hello? Rosemary? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. You're safe now, Rosemary, shh. Hey, sweetheart, shh. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. Nobody, nobody is gonna hurt you. I promise you, shh, shh. Hey, hey, you're safe, you're safe now. Rosemary, this is Anna, the lady I told you about. Hello, Rosemary. I really wanted to meet you. Because I believe we are the same. You see? And I've never told this to anyone, not one person. I was a little older than you but I was still very scared. And I believed bad things would happen if I did not do as I was told. So I did as I was told. But bad things still happened. Terrible things. I was lonely, afraid. All I could do was cry and pray. Then one day a voice inside me said, "Anna, only you can make these bad things stop." Who? I don't know. Maybe it was me. My heart. But I found the strength to say, "Enough!" "My name is Anna and I swear to myself I will save myself! "I swear." And do you know what happened next? Good things happened next. School. Friends. Good things. All because I listened to what is in here. Inside. And in here. We are the same. We are good women. [melodious foreign music] Number five. [Anthony] Good girl. [children singing] Daddy, Daddy! Daddy! How are you? I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. Did you have a good day at school today? Was it a good day? Yeah? Good girl. [aeroplane rumbling] [melodious instrumental music]
