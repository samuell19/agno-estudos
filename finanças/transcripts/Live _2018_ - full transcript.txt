I just got cut on my tooth. - That looks bad. - Yeah, she totally handed me my ass. I think she was ex pro. - Hey, I'm sorry I wasn't there. - Yeah. All the comment boards were like, "Where is he?" Well, sweet yeah, I knew that fight was going to pop. - It didn't. I mean there were more comments, but the views just stayed the same. And this fight, was so much more intense than the other one. I don't know, this new algorithm is frigging killing me. - Can you get by on it, for you know at least another week with your other streams? - I don't know, maybe. - Maybe you should do an AI consult. You know, optimize your channel. - With what extra bit credit? I'm totally maxed out with the setup. - Hey, you'll get another sponsor. Come on. Let's visualize. What do you want? Strike pop? - Come on. - What, wizard cams? Those cams are next gen AI. - Stop. - Bite aid. - Stop. Jesus. - What? - This. I mean, look at me! Could barely get out of bed this morning. - Hey, I'm beat too. You know. I streamed for 10 hours straight last night. - Oh my God, gaming is hardly the same. - You were the one who made this whole fight girl persona. All right, and fan engagement is exhausting. - Okay look, 10 years ago to help my acting career. Do you think that I thought it was going to get to this point? - Lay off the fight club. - And do what? - Fake an injury. - And then what? Nobody hires real actors anymore. I'm not like, 16 with like a shopping bag to inhaul. - Hey, I'd like to see you at 16. - Stop, I'm serious. - So am I. - Oh yeah. You had fantasies about me when I was 16. - Yeah. - Well. I was chubby. And I had frizzy hair. Bad frizzy hair. And I was obsessed with a 24 year old. - So, nothing much has changed. - I take it back. This is the best version of you. Live. - Censors. - Delete censors. Censors. - Delete censors. - Stop. - What? - Stop. Cut. - You can't keep cutting. - I just. You know we don't do it without censors. - Everybody's doing it without em. - What is that supposed to mean? - Just that, you know, we have to evolve. - Into porn stars? No. - You know, Max and Rebecca just had Redmaf sponsor their baby shower. - What? - Their numbers spiked because they got two new sponsors. - You want to get pregnant? - I'm just saying, if you don't want to amp up the sex, that's an option. Aren't you thinking about it. At your age? - Screw you. - I just tried. - Maybe I should just quit and work for Zoomer. - Don't even. - What? It's acting. Keeping all those losers company in the car. - You know, we can just move to one of those beer sponsored party cities and live for free. - I just said, I just said, that I didn't want to fuck for the camera. What part of that do you not understand? - You see, this is all we have left. Okay, our pain. Ourselves. Our love. That's the only things that those AI's that they can't do better than us. - Did you get that off of a Starbucks cup? - So what if I did? - Oh my God, your generation. - What? - I just can't be on like this anymore. I can't keep chasing an algorithm. I just, I can't keep upping the stakes of my own life just to survive. - You have to. - No! - Live. - Cut! - Live! - Cut! Disengage secondary access. - This is exactly the shit we need to be broadcasting. Authenticity! - Weren't you supposed to feature that for another week? - Yeah. - Okay. Maybe we should take a break. See other people. - Okay. - Could be good for our channels. - Sure. - Do you want to go back and maybe we can try to rehash this? I mean, I think it's really, really good. Seriously. We could find something else to break. - Live.
