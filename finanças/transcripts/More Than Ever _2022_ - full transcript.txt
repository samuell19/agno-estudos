The film you're about to watch was born under a lucky star. -Go without me. -No, please. I won't go on my own. -Come on. -No. How about this? I'll dress you, you don't have to do anything. I'll even put on your make-up. Come on. There we go. Stop moving. I'm better than you at this anyway. Come on... Shit. -Hi. -Hi. -Take a seat. -Shall I sit here? What would you like to drink? -Mathieu? -Champagne! -So a beer, then. -That's fine by me. What about you, Hélène? -Water. -Water, coming right up. Thank you. I've cooked some Catalan octopus for tonight. Audrey and Mehdi, of course. -Your shirts are always... -That's why we're late. -I was hesitating. -It looks pretty good. You never come, so for sure you can't be late. -How are you? -Good and you? I'm so glad you came. -Hi. -Hi. I'm glad to see you. Me too. Something to drink? I'll have a beer, please. It's a girl. I can feel it, I'm never wrong. All right, don't get too handsy. Shall we bet a dinner out? -How long has it been? -Eight weeks. It's still so tiny! Hélène? Looking for something? Some ice. Do you want another drink? More water? No. Still working at your firm in Chartrons? No, I stopped working a month ago. It's a relief not having to go to the office anymore. But it's sad at the same time. Maybe you'll get back earlier than expected. Yes. There's a couple of missing motifs. -Mathieu, some wine? -Of course. No wine for you? -Really? -Yes, sure. It's hard to gauge the size of it. -Audrey? -No, thanks. I'm driving. I've rented us the chalet in the Jura for two weeks in February. Great! So we're sure to get it! -Some wine? -Sure. Why are you lying? You think I'm not pleased to know you're pregnant? -Hélène, please. -But it's true. You brought me here because everyone wanted to see me. So there you go. I'm here. I may not look great, it may not be what you expected, but... Here you go. Yes, I am sick. And I may even die. But you, Audrey, you're going to have a child. And that's beautiful. But stop behaving like this with me. Nobody knows what to do in such a situation. But I don't know either. So stop behaving like this. It's humiliating. So what should we do? Forget about you? Maybe just do nothing. Don't go! Hélène, really... As if I'm ever going back to work. Look, it was clumsy. They're trying their best. The best they can, that's all. Come here. We're walking like an old couple... Mathieu. Are you upset? Do I have a choice? Hello. How are you? How are you? Hello. What are you up to? Nothing special. Have you seen Dr. Girlotto? Any news? What about you? Let's talk about you for a change. What are you up to? What do you want me to say? Right, listen to this. Yesterday, I took Julot to the lake and he stole some kid's ball. I'm sending you some pictures. There we go. You got them? The kid's father was furious, wanted to call the police. Very funny. You know, I can take the afternoon train to come see you. No, I'm fine. -It's no bother, you know. -Mom, it's fine. Don't cry. Mom, please. There's nothing we can do, that's how it is. I love you. I love you too. -Call me back, please... -Yes, it'll be all right. -Bye, sweetheart. -Bye. ADD TO BOOKMARKS Are your seizures more frequent? No. No. I still have them, but the same as before. I'm going to prescribe you some opiates. Unnecessary suffering is not my thing. Nor is it mine. We had a meeting with lung specialists at Hospital Cochin. In your case, you'd be eligible for a double lung transplant. Really? That's great! Of course, we'll have to be patient to find the perfect donor, who would be sufficiently compatible. We have to make sure the lungs will be healthy enough. Mrs. Mouchet? It's good news. Yes. But it's a major surgery. There's a risk of rejection. We sometimes have to replace a transplanted lung after an infection. But if the transplant works, it means she can live. I cannot promise anything. I look after many patients suffering from IPF. They are usually older. And 50% of them are still alive three years after the transplant. Think about it. Take all the time you need. Unfortunately, there's no alternative at the moment. I operated on a patient ten days ago. Everything went well. If you wish, I can ask him to talk to you tomorrow. Yes. Perhaps it's a good idea. Come, let's eat. You're tap dancing. -Look. -Wow! I've never seen this photo, where did you get it? Remember that workshop with the American teacher? In Auvergne? What was his name again? -Henry. -Henry, that's right. He always carried a big wooden plank for us to practice anywhere. And we slept in that tiny tent. It's funny. I remember you were really good. He loved to dance with you. What did he always say? You're not eating? In the hospital today... -I was waiting for you to mention it. -Yes. So what did he say? We didn't really talk. He was exhausted, and I... I felt very weird. And I felt like I couldn't breathe. -For God's sake. -What? I don't understand why you're always negative. For now, it's your only chance, so be a bit more positive. Do you realize you interrupt me every time I talk about my feelings? Or my fears? Can't you imagine that I'm afraid? My love, they put you on the list. It means that you now have a good chance to get healthy lungs, that's good news! I don't get it. And you're young and strong. -Your body will accept the lungs. -How can you know that? We don't know that. Okay. I spoke with Gérard. It's fine if I go to the workshop three days a week, and on the other days stay home and look for frames online. No. You know what I think? I don't want your life to change. I don't want this to impact you. Of course, it has an impact on my life and my work! Do you think I go to work and pretend that... Stop it! Please, stop. I want to spend time with you. Is it so hard to understand? I'm right here. You can see that. I'm not in a coffin. Mathieu. I need space. You need space? Okay. Okay. Damn. -Do you have a light? -Nope. Thanks. Are you all right? I'm all right. Does Marie still travel so much? Yes, all the time. Do you miss her when she's away? Yes, of course. Well, it depends... Why? I don't know... I sometimes think I'd be better off on my own. That's not true... It's not true, I miss her. I miss her so badly... We've never spent so much time together, and I miss her so. It's very strange... She's here, but... it feels like she's already gone. Hello? Are you French? So let's speak in French. I hope you understand me. Yes. I used to work with French people. And where was that? I worked for three years on an offshore oil rig in the Ivory Coast. Africa rocks. Africa's the top. It kicks ass. It kicks ass. Are you sick? Yes. Before I was diagnosed, I thought... that I'd want to talk about it a lot, but it's actually the opposite. And you've kept that to yourself? Yes. Except for my husband and my mother. My friends found out little by little. The living cannot understand the dying. So it's better not to see anyone. Yes. Perhaps it's best for everyone. You okay? I was wondering where you had gone. I had to fetch my oxygen concentrator. Are you there? Yes. I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep anyway. You're drunk. Did you smoke weed? You know how they are. Do you have some left? I'd like a smoke. Maybe. A bit... reckless, isn't it? Just a little, okay? Are you sure? That's enough. Come on. Come on, stop now... No, no. No, come on, stop. Are you okay? Easy. Please, I want to. Wait. Lie down. Lie down. Come on. Lie... Lie on your back. Come on. Lie down. That's it. Are you okay? It doesn't matter. It's all right. -Fuck! -It's okay. I love you. I'm off. Okay? Mathieu? What? I... I want to go to Norway. To Norway? Why Norway? For the fresh air and nature. I've always been fascinated by the landscape. I've thought about it a lot lately. And Dr. Girlotto says I should get out more. I've already looked up the itinerary. It's not very complicated and it's cheap. I can ask Gérard about it. Last year, Anne covered for me and it went well. No. What? I'd like to go alone. Why alone? I don't get it. What does that mean? You want to cross half of Europe on your own? That's ridiculous. I thought you were scared of flying. I'm taking the train. You're going to go to Norway by train? In your condition? -What... -I need to go. I need to go far away. To find a new place. Time for myself. Silence to think, to reconnect with myself. To find some lightness again. And that's impossible with me, right? No! That's not what I meant. I'm trying to explain to you that I need some distance, but distance from everything. Right here, all I do is wait. I can't take it anymore. What if Dr. Girlotto finds a donor, what do we do then? Will you do the long journey back? I don't know. But I know I have to take this trip now. Because I don't know if I'll have the strength down the line. I can feel the time is now. And you, you traveled alone to Chile ten years ago. I've never done anything like that. I've never had the courage. There's always been something stopping me. Work, my mother or you. -I've never stopped you from traveling. -No. So perhaps I never dared. Even though I'm sick, I'm still allowed to give it a chance, no? No, Hélène. I can't let you go, it's a big mistake. I'm sorry, it's out of the question. No, no. I want to take this trip, even if you disagree. I'm going to take this trip. Mathieu. My love. Comma. You must be asleep already. Full stop. I'm feeling surprisingly good. Full stop. I don't know why I've never traveled alone before. Full stop. I love you. Exclamation mark. -Hélène? -Yes. Mister? My name is Bent. Thank you. It's beautiful out here. For sure. But I've gotten used to it. This is it. See you later. Thank you. I've arrived safely. Full stop. I'm doing well. Full stop. I miss you. Exclamation mark. In uppercase. A LOT. Exclamation mark. What... Finally! -At last! -Hello. What happened? -Are you all right? -Yes. I have no signal. Almost. I had to climb a hill to call you. Everyone does it, there are lots of people here. Did you receive the photos from the trip? Yes. Hélène, I was so worried. I know, but I'm fine. The trip was a bit tiring, but I'm fine now. I tried to reach you for two days. I've called so many times and sent messages. -I didn't receive anything. -It's normal I'm worried! -I didn't receive anything. -It's not cool. Sorry. It's fine. You look like you're doing well. How's the hotel? Don't they have Wi-Fi there? It would be good to get in touch if there's an emergency. I didn't check, I was too tired. I'll check it out later. You have to see that: Nature. -Wow. -Can you see? Beautiful. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It means they don't know anything about it, where it comes from or how to treat it. Perhaps that's better for you. When you have cancer, they all know what to do. So they kill you with their drugs. -I've never seen it that way. -No? My lung tissue is getting thicker. So it becomes harder and fibrous. The air can't get in. So you can't breathe anymore. And it gets worse... until you suffocate. My only option is to have a transplant. They'd open up my chest, pull my lungs out, throw them in the trash, and find new ones. From someone else. And hope my body accepts them and I can breathe with them. Either it works or it doesn't. So it really sucks. Sorry. What time is it? How long was I asleep for? Five hours at least. -Hi! How are you? -Hi. Do you see me? I'm glad. I waited for your call yesterday. I slept for 15 hours straight. I couldn't sleep in the hotel, so I moved. So you're not in the hotel anymore? No. I met an old guy in a supermarket. And it turns out he's renting a cabin in his backyard. So I decided to move there. Yeah? -So you're now living at an old guy's? -Since yesterday, yes. It's really pretty. It overlooks the fjord. Isn't it a bit weird to live with a guy you don't know? No. He even speaks French. He's very nice, and is often on his own. It's very quiet there, I sleep very well. I'll send you some pictures. All right. Over there, I was sitting on the ground, and for a few seconds... I was ready to leave. Was that a friend? An acquaintance. And do you like her? You rarely get visitors, what did she want? -Hello? -Hello? -It's you? -Yes. Are you all right? Yes, I am. What about you? I'm fine. I'm pleased to hear your voice. Me too. Are you okay? Your voice is thin. I had a dizzy spell. What do you mean? It was... I think I pushed too hard during a walk. -Damn, Hélène. -But I'm feeling better now. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure. I think I understood something important. Tell me. It's hard to explain. But... The nature, the sky, the wind... and the constant light, it's like a shock. And at the same time, it's comforting. It's reassuring. It's weird, I'm sick, but I feel good at the same time. Do you understand? No, not really. I don't know if it's because I'm on my own, or if it's the environment and everything, but I suddenly feel aware of my body. I feel present within my body. And I feel that I want... I want my body... What? What do you want? I think I don't want the transplant. What? Damn it, Hélène... -That's bullshit! -It's my body. Oh no. I don't want to suffer in a hospital. I don't want them to open me up and stitch me back up again. I don't want to die in hospital if the surgery doesn't work. I don't want doctors to decide my fate. -Why are you giving up? -No. -I'm not. -Yes, you are. It's the opposite. I am fully aware, and I'm making a choice. I'm choosing how I'm going to leave. No, you're choosing to die, full stop. I don't know what's going in Norway, but this is not a discussion we should have on the phone. So I'm coming. I'm coming to get you. I'll take a plane. Thank you. Dinner is served! Let's go. Oh, no, no, no. -Are you sure? -Yes. Okay. On three? One, two, three! Damn! I can't... Are you okay? Hélène... We'll go step by step. But if they find a donor, you can't stay here. You know that... Not now, Mathieu. Please. I don't understand why you don't want to seize the opportunity. Can I have one? Thanks. I made this... How do you say in French? -An embankment. -Yes. I built it myself. There was nothing here before. I transported the stones by tractor and worked like crazy for weeks. I showed photos to Hélène... -Sorry. -No, no. Has Bent left? I'm feeling very tired all of a sudden. I think I'm going to lie down in the hut. I'll join you. Aren't you cold? You know, I've been thinking. If you really want to stay here, we'll stay. We'll stay as long as you want. I'll find a solution. If they find a donor, we'll see. I even thought we could rent a house in the area. What do you think? What's wrong? I can't. What do you mean, you can't? It's... It's too hard. What's too hard? I know it's hurting you... to see me like this. And I know it scares you. I can see it in your eyes when you look at me. And I won't get better. I won't get better. I so want to get better because I love you. But we both know that I won't succeed. It's only going to get worse. I don't have a future anymore. But you can go on. You'll start a new life. You'll meet someone new and you'll have a child! -Stop it, please! -Why should I stop? It's the truth! It's true and it hurts! That's what's going to happen. And you say you want to live your life with me. But I can't! When I see you, I see everything we used to be. And everything we could have been. Everything we will never be again. Never again! Because of me and I hate myself for it. Do you get it? And when you're not here, it's easier. You hate yourself for it? It's easier when I'm not here? What about me? Did you think about me? You think it's easier for me? Do you even realize what you're saying? Shall I go back to Bordeaux and live my life as if nothing happened? I go to work, dine with our friends, while I know you're here all alone, just... Just what? Just dying. That's what's going to happen, you'll die here, all alone! Is that what you want? That's not how it's done. In those moments, you should be surrounded by loved ones. You should stay with your loved ones till the end! How dare you ask me that? Where are you going? For a walk. You coming? Hélène. Slow down, please. Where are you going? What are you playing at? Hélène. Please stop. Enough. Stop it, that's enough. Hélène. Oh no. Why did you do that? Calm down. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Breathe... Come here. Breathe, breathe. Open your mouth. Hélène, Hélène. That's it. That's it. I'm here. Can you hear me? That's it. Breathe, that's good. Here we are. That's it. Here we go. It's all right. That's it. That's it. Okay, then. MORE THAN EVER
