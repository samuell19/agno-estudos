Take your wig off. Take your wig off. Turn and face the wall. That's right. Turn and face the wall. Face the wall. All right, that's it. PRISONER 1: Are you a natural blond? (PRISONER WOLF WHISTLES) Chicken Delight. He deliver! PRISONER 2: Man, don't put that in here. She ain't my type. PRISONER 3: That's my wife you're talking about. She here for our conjugal visit. Come on over here and let daddy show you what he got in his pants for you. PRISONER 4: Shit! She got the same thing up under her skirt that you got in your pants. GUARD: All right, come on, y'all, we got a lady here. Okay, Agee, you got any concealed weapons that they didn't find up front? PRISONER 3: You got something concealed. But it ain't no weapon. (LAUGHTER) What do you say you strip, just to make sure? (WHOOPS) (PRISONERS IMITATING STRIPTEASE MUSIC) (PRISONERS WHOOPING) (PRISONERS APPLAUDING) PRISONER 4: A star is born! GUARD: Hey, Kirkland, watch your hands! PRISONER 1: Hey, watch that! GUARD: Come on, Kirkland. Let's go! PRISONER 1: Ain't too proud, man, look at that. PRISONER 4: Hey, man, make a phone call for me, man. PRISONER 2: Hey, don't run off now, big shot. (PRISONER 2 LAUGHING) Yeah! Yeah! All right! All right, all right, baby! Yeah! Where the hell is he? What do you mean, he's in jail? My lawyer's in jail? Contempt of court? He's too goddamn emotional! Get him. I've had a car accident. I haven't left the scene of the accident, I'm in it! DISPATCHER: Be advised, no record, no warrant. Can't you hear the confusion around me, huh? You hear this noise? They're trying. They're trying to get me out of the car! I'm trapped. I'm trapped because some son of a bitch... Sir, could you move back? We're going to try and get you out of here. Move? Can't you see I'm on the phone? Just a minute now. Keep it down, for Christ's sake! Here we go. Goddamn it! You gotta swing it over. Listen, I want you to tell Arthur to get over here. I'm on the Eager Street... Where are we? Eager Street. Eager Street exit. Just tell him to get over here. You can't miss it. I understand you took a swing at Judge Fleming. Is that true? Hey, Kiley, why don't you do something about that kid in there? Put him someplace else. Oh, they're just having some fun with him, that's all. Fun? Well, sometimes the boys get bored. With you, it's still new and exciting. Sign here. Why don't you ease up on the judge? He's your kind of a guy, huh? Yeah, Fleming's a tough man. Hates scum almost as much as we do. (GRUNTS) Good morning, Mr. Kirkland. Carl. Get out. Come on, over here. Are you all right? I want you to sue the son of a bitch who did this to me. Every cent he's got. Every nickel! Thank God I can walk. Carl, you all right? Disappear. Why don't you just wait... She wasn't hurt, there's nothing to report. Why don't you wait in the car? It's warm in there. Okay? There's no need for the wife to know. After all, I was your first. You know, Arthur? I was your first client. And you broke cherry on me. Not the time to go down memory lane, Carl. Let's just get you to the hospital and get you checked out. Would you lie back? You're the best, Arthur. You get every nickel, then you have him put away. I'll see he gets the death penalty, Carl. Death is okay, too. Good. Jesus, you stink. Somebody piss on you? Get him out of here. Make sure nobody uses my car phone! I'm in the hospital, some jerk calls Rome. MAN: I borrowed his car. You son of a bitch! You lunatic! Carl, Carl, you're gonna have a stroke. You'll have to deal with my lawyer! The death penalty! You'll die for this! He's the best! It's not even my car. Calm, calm, calm. I got a terrible headache. You'll be all right. I'll call you at the hospital. What about this guy here? He says he's all right. I mean, it's a friend's car. I just borrowed it for the night... And now how am I gonna tell him? I think you should go to the hospital. Well, I'm okay, but the car... I know, I know. Let me take you over to the hospital. I borrowed it for one night and my horoscope said it was gonna be a great day and look what happened! Shit! You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. Man, no, it's not going to be that way this time. Our best bet is to request a postponement, which would put us into late January. I asked you a question. Look at me when I'm talking to you! DA's willing to go two years, one year probation. That's a lot of fucking time, man. Hi, Arthur. I ain't kissing nobody's ass. I'm not asking you to kiss it. Just give it a little pat. Arthur. Arthur. Excuse me? Yes? Hold it, Wenke. Where are you going? Bathroom. Go home. No. Go home and change. No. You look like shit. What would you say if I walked into court looking like that? Arthur? What would... Arthur, what would you say? Arthur, I don't want to keep harping on this, but the Ethics Committee is checking up on everyone. Please, you gotta watch it. Okay, I'll watch it. Last week, two lawyers were disbarred on minor charges. You run around, you get thrown into jail on contempt of court. Fleming got me crazy. You push Fleming... Got me crazy. On that McCullaugh thing, there's gonna be big trouble, I'm telling you. McCullaugh's innocent and I can't get that goddamn Fleming to even look at the evidence, Jay. What do you want me to do? You don't threaten a judge. You don't threaten a judge! Will you do me a personal favor? Put this on. Shithouse. I got Fleming first thing this morning. Give him my love. The tie, I like it. It's Fleming's favorite color. BAILIFF: All rise. Criminal Court of Baltimore City is now in session. The Honorable Henry T. Fleming presiding. Be seated. If Your Honor, please, for the first matter, the State will call case number 57746898, State v. Robert Wenke. FLEMING: Mr. Wenke, may I ask you to step forward, please? And how many times have you been before the bench, Mr. Wenke? Three times, Your Honor. Mmm-hmm. Once for assault, once for arson, once for grand larceny. And now we have indecent exposure. What's the matter, Mr. Wenke? Can't you decide what you want to be when you grow up? (PEOPLE LAUGHING) You got anything to say? Yes, Your Honor, I'm a loyal Colts fan. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) You are also a revolting, despicable scum of the earth, who should be taken out and squashed like a cockroach. Judge Fleming, I object! My client has not been found guilty yet. You're absolutely right, Counselor. Let's see, it's now 9:40. At 9:41, he will be guilty. I find the defendant, Robert Wenke, guilty as charged. Sentence to be imposed at a later time. At this time, Your Honor, I would like to request that Mr. Wenke's bail be continued. Bail is revoked. Thank you, Your Honor. PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, please, the State will now call indictment number 57746899. That was good. That was very good work. I want to thank you for your counsel. Very nice. Colts fan. I need Colts? That's terrific, Wenke. Then you do know it? The big white house, you know, with the fat columns out in front. On Greenway Avenue. Guess how much that house is worth on the market today? Oh, I don't know. Take a guess. Seven million. $243,000. Now, that's some nut I've got, huh? That's okay. I get enough accident cases this year, I'll be all right. Maybe I ought to start throwing out banana peels. Listen, recess is almost over and all I've got left is this illegal lottery case. Did you know that there's a guy eating something off your table? Huh? The guy you're prosecuting. Yeah? He's eating the lottery tickets. Holy shit. Gibson, get the hell away out! Get out! (EXCLAIMING) Don't swallow! You son of a bitch! That's my client. Give me it! Give me that! Don't swallow! My client! Spit it out! (ALL CLAMORING) ARTHUR: My client! (WOMEN SCREAMING) Gentlemen, need I remind you, you are in a court of law? Now, let's proceed in an orderly fashion. What the hell are you doing? Does the defense have anything further to add? Your Honor, it's... I guess I should request a recess, so that my client could get something to eat. He's obviously very hungry. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) My client, McCullaugh. Could I see him for a minute? Sure, Mr. Kirkland. Stick your hand out. Hey, Mr. Kirkland, what happened? Look, I just wanna reaffirm what I said to you yesterday. We're going to get you out. I know you're trying, Mr. Kirkland, but this is crazy, you know? I know it. I know it. I mean, you told me you had the evidence that proves I'm innocent. That means it does prove it, doesn't it? Yes, Jeff, you're innocent. And that there Judge Fleming agrees with you, right? Right. Well, if everyone agrees that I'm innocent, how come I'm going back to jail? GUARD: Roll 'em. There's enough proof, Jeff. It's just that the court won't accept the proof. Why not? Well, there's a law... There's a law which says that evidence must be submitted within a certain time period. (STAMMERING) And our evidence came in three days late. What difference does that make? What difference does it make if it came in three years late? They got the proof they need, they should let me go! That's enough! I don't understand this. That judge has sent me to jail and he knows that I'm innocent. What's going on here? Wait, wait. It's just gonna take a little more time, that's all. Any other judge would have let you out, but this guy Fleming, he goes by the letter of the law. I don't understand that! Jeff, I promise. I promise I'll get you out. I promise you, Jeff. PRISONER: He promises he'll get you out, buddy, don't worry. Judge Fleming. I want to apologize to you, sir, for my behavior in the courtroom the other day. I don't want to hear your apologies. I don't want to hear anything you have to say. Well, that's understandable, sir. It's just... It's just I thought that maybe we could discuss this McCullaugh case. You and I, man to man. Off the record, sir. Look, if you're gonna try to make a deal with me, you might wind up right back in jail. A deal? Deal? No, sir. No, sir. I'm not trying to make a deal. Look, sir, I can understand your strict enforcement of the statute. But what I can't understand is that my client's constitutional rights are being denied. Don't you quote the law to me. My client is innocent. Personally, I don't give a shit about your client. Hi. Hi, Sherry. Hi, Mr. Kirkland, nice to see you. Hi, Mrs. Tate. How are you today? He'll be right with you. Boy, do you look tired. Coffee, please. Mrs. Tate wants to talk to you. Her son broke his leg again. Neighbor's driveway. And Bricker wants to know if your client will settle for $60,000. You can reach him at the club. Coffee, please. Oh, you have three new clients coming in today. One's a whiplash, one's divorce, and the other one has something to do with amnesia. I don't know what it is. Arthur, what are you doing? No foam. That's because it's deodorant. And today's Tuesday, so don't forget to visit your grandfather. And you have to be back in court at 2:15. Coffee, please. You want some coffee? Sherry, stay with me today, dear. I need you today. Arthur. (WHISTLES) Arthur! Come here. Hi, Judge. We gonna get together this weekend, huh? I don't know. You're the only one I've been dating these days. Come on, now. You promised you'd go flying with me. I gotta tell you, Judge, you know, I'm not too fond of anything that takes place off the ground. Heights. I don't know. I got a thing about heights. Come on, this is flying, it's different. How high up do you go? How high up do you want to go? Come on, it'll be good for you. Sure. Besides, it gets lonesome up there. Why don't you take your wife, Judge? (CHUCKLING) The last thing we did together was get married. Come on, Arthur. Now, you promised me, remember? All right. What time? Sunday morning. 10:00. Do you always carry that thing with you? There's law and there's order. And that's order. Hey, you like egg roll? Yeah. Good. Come on, let's get out of here. Easy, easy, easy. All right, you got it. (CHUCKLING) Son of a gun. So, it's another week already? Another week. I don't know where time goes. No problems, Grandpa. Everything all right? See this one? A wonderful woman. I went to her husband's funeral. A fine man. Gitel. Hello, Sam. How are you? This is my grandson, Arthur. I'm pleased to meet you. Hello. Good to meet you. He goes to law school. I'm a lawyer. Take my advice. Don't be in a hurry. He's a nice-looking boy. My grandson. Yes. Good to meet you. Pleased to have met you, too. See you. So, it's been a week. Yeah, Grandpa, remember? It's been a week. Last week we went for a ride in the car, remember? Oh. That's a good machine. Always give signals when you turn. Right. Right. Left. (CHATTERING) So... Are you a good lawyer? Are you honest? Well, I don't know. Being honest doesn't have much to do with being a lawyer, Grandpa. If you're not honest, you got nothing. Your parents should see you now. To hell with them. They never cared before, why are they gonna care now? They're still your parents. No. You raised me. You're the one that put me through law school. You're a wonderful man, Grandpa, but your son, he's a shit. He was born with colic. Sam, I love you. Look at you. Filled out, like a man. Soon, you'll look like a lawyer and you'll be a lawyer. I am a lawyer, Sam. I have been a lawyer for 12 years. So, it's another week already. CECIL: Do you know Jules Stouffer? ARTHUR: Yes, I do. CECIL: He was a client of yours, isn't that right? ARTHUR: Yes. Wasn't he originally represented by Alvin Burton? Yes, that is correct. Why did he change representation? Because I handled him on an aggravated assault charge. That's my area, not Burton's area, so... Did Jules Stouffer express dissatisfaction with Mr. Burton? No, not at all. Burton's an excellent lawyer. You're not going after him, are you? We're not "going after" anyone, Mr. Kirkland. We're simply trying to... Do you know David Crebbs? We are simply trying to review certain accusations to determine whether or not they are true and to, more or less, clean our own house. So, please, do not over dramatize these proceedings. This is not the McCarthy hearings. Oh, that's a relief. So you're not gonna ask me, "Are you now, or have you ever been, a lawyer?" That wasn't amusing, Mr. Kirkland. Do you know David Crebbs? No, it wasn't, Miss... Packer. Packer. This isn't amusing. It is, however, ridiculous. Yes, David Crebbs, I know him. Have you ever seen... (MICROPHONE FEEDING BACK) Is this mike working? Do you know David Crebbs? Why are we using microphones? Why don't we just talk to each other? We're close enough. This is a hearing, Mr. Kirkland. Oh. Yes, it's a hearing. CRENNA: Do you know Jules Stouffer? We've already asked that question. We're through with Stouffer? How about Alvin Burton? Do you know David Crebbs? I already asked that. What did he say? He said, "Yes." Have you ever seen him intoxicated in court? David Crebbs has a speech impediment. Now, if you check your records, you'll see it's there someplace. "No." That's the answer to your question. No, he doesn't drink. Doesn't drink at all. At this point, I would just like to say that what this committee is doing, in theory, is highly commendable. However, in practice, it sucks. And I am not going to answer any more questions. What do you think we're trying to do in there? Wanna drink? No. Whatever you may think, we are not conducting some kind of a witch hunt. What are you doing then? Well, you might not be aware of this, Mr. Kirkland, but there's a lot of corruption going around that nobody's doing anything about. You think your committee is doing something about it? Yes, I do. That committee is a very dangerous farce. Whoa. Mr. Kirkland. I spend 14 hours a day working on that committee. I don't care how many hours a day you spend. I don't do it because it's gonna give me a couple of good laughs. You could spend the rest of your life, you know what you're gonna wind up accomplishing? You know, listen to me, if we don't police our own activities... Maybe ruining the careers of a few little guys... Nothing's gonna happen. Who happened to wipe their ass the wrong way. Other than that, nothing. So, what do you think? About what? About me? What do you think? Think I'm kind of interesting? Somebody you'd like to have a drink with? I think that you're crazy. Oh. What about Daniels? Say around 7:30? I don't think so. 8:00? 8:30. All right. Uh, I'm Arthur Kirkland. You wanted to see me? Yeah. Yeah, my man Bambi, ooh, he recommended you real highly. He said, "Arthur Kirkland, he the man to see." Okay, Ralph, why don't you tell me what happened? It says here, in the report, that you were involved in a robbery. Uh-uh. No, sir, uh-uh, no. See, what happened is, it was time to come down on the nigger. Listen, Kirkland, you know, it's like smoking. They got to have a nigger every 20 minutes. See, what happened is I was in this alley, petting my dog, when they came down on me... It states that the dog was attacking you when you were first seen in the alley. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, well, see, my dog, he gets like that sometimes. It also states that the dog belonged to a Mrs. B. Jackson. Well, he sure looked like my dog. You know, he had that little... Come on, Ralph, it also states here that when asked what you were doing in the alley you replied, "I don't know nothin' about that taxicab robbery." Now, that's the truth, 'cause I don't. How did you know there was one, Ralph? Mr. Kirkland, there's always one. Ralph, tell me the truth or get another lawyer. I don't need the bullshit. Let's go. Okay. I was in that cab, but I didn't rob it. It was my cousin's idea. I didn't know nothin'. It was my cousin's idea. See, he crazy. What's your cousin's name? I don't know. I mean... (STAMMERING) Uh... He live over on Hillsdale. You don't know your cousin's name? Ralph, who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm an idiot? Okay. I read a report, I can tell if somebody's bullshitting me or not. Now, either you give me some straight answers, or you get yourself another lawyer. I don't have time to listen to some jive-ass put me on. Okay. It wasn't my idea, but I did know what was coming down. See, me and my cousin Royce... Royce Shavers... See, he figures that since I am the way I am... Mr. Kirkland, I can look real fine sometimes, you know? Yeah, I'm sure you can, Ralph. (STAMMERING) Well, Royce figures that we can be a couple. You know, like a man and a woman couple. Mmm-hmm. 'Cause a cab driver will pick up a couple a whole lot faster than they will two nigger men. So... We got into this cab over on Garrison Boulevard, and we asked him to take us down to the harbor. You know, like we was tourists. Yeah. Hey, man, I can't go to jail, man. I just can't do it. I can't go to that place. Please, Mr. Kirkland, you've got to help me, please. Please. Okay. Please. Okay, I'll help you, Ralph. Just don't lie to me, that's all. Okay? Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. Don't lie to me. Okay? Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. (WOMAN GIGGLING) Thanks for bringing me home, Gail. Oh, God. Well... You really take renting an unfurnished apartment literally, don't you? Arthur, you know, it doesn't have to stay this way. What happened? Did your wife take you in the divorce settlement? She had a better lawyer. Oh. What about your kids? You get to see them much? Well, they're in California, you know. Phone calls, holidays. Put the food out. I'll get the plates. I guess I was lucky. We never had any kids. How long were you married? Three years. Oh. Were you in love? No. I was in love with the law. You know what I mean? You got a serving spoon? Serving spoon. Thank you. So, you eat out a lot? Yeah. You? Yeah. The committee works just about every night. How did you feel when you walked out on the committee this morning? Did you feel all those daggers in your back? That's a very dangerous group, you know? Jesus. Here we go. Here we go. Arthur, why? Why do you feel it's dangerous? Because you're conning the public into thinking you're doing something, and you're not. Yeah, but we are doing something. No, you're not. We are protecting the public from a lot of corrupt lawyers, is what we're doing. You're skimming the surface. You're not going after real power. (WHISTLES) Wow, that's scary. What real power, Arthur? You don't know? No. Why don't you tell me? Well, now we know they're definitely safe. What makes you think you know so goddamn much? I don't know so much. No, no, tell me. What makes you the great voice of authority? (SCOFFS) I don't pretend to be a voice of authority. It's just I don't think you know what you're doing, that's all. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah. This is nice, don't you think? No, I don't find this particularly nice. Arthur, I'm... I'm angry again. I don't like being angry. Well, it's not very pleasant. No, I don't understand how you can criticize me for what I do. I'm not criticizing you, Gail. I mean, you're taking it too personally. Arthur, the committee is doing something about what's going on. We are not sitting in jail at nights because of contempt of court. Do you know what that's about? Yeah. Yeah? You threw a punch at Judge Fleming. Uh-huh. You know why? I have no idea. Tell me. I got a client who's in jail because of a faulty taillight and I can't get him out. What do you mean, you can't get him out? You wanna hear a story about our wonderful judicial system? Sure. There's a guy named Jeff McCullaugh. And he's going down the highway one night, and the cops stop him because his taillight isn't working. They pull him over to the side, run a make on him. The computer kicks back that there's a Jeff McCullaugh wanted in Alabama for assault with a deadly weapon. Was this the same Jeff McCullaugh? No, but he fits the general description, so they arrest him. Why didn't McCullaugh tell them they had the wrong person? Well, he did. He tried. He told the public defender, who I don't think really believed him and he was too busy, he never even bothered to check. Are you serious? No, wait, it gets better. While Jeff is sitting in jail, a guard is stabbed and the knife is planted in Jeff's cell. And Jeff is brought to trial on a new charge. This time, assaulting a guard with a deadly weapon. And a trial date is set six months from the time he was first picked up. I'll make a long story short for you. Six months go by, and a very shaky, very crazy Jeff McCullaugh goes to court. Now, the public defender who's defending him, he says... He tells Jeff that he can get him off if he pleads guilty. He'll make a deal with the judge, and he'll get him off. Time served. Right. So he pleads guilty, even though he's innocent. That's right. Right. However, the deal was made with a Judge Callahan. The day of the trial, Judge Callahan cannot be found. Fleming is in his place. Fleming doesn't know anything about the deal. Jeff pleads guilty. Fleming sentences Jeff to five years in prison. (SIGHS) So... God damn. One little guy has already spent a year and a half in jail because his lights didn't work. I've spent the last year putting together enough evidence to prove he's innocent. And I prove it. I get it all together and I bring it into Fleming's court, and he throws it out. Why? Because it came in three days late. Holy shit. That's incredible. It's not incredible. It's Fleming. (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) No, Arthur. That's the law. You can't fault Fleming legally 'cause he was going by the letter of the law. Are you kidding? No, I'm not. You talk to me like that, you're not going to get me into bed, dear. Yes, I will. I've had tougher cases. You're so easy. You knew that, huh? (LAUGHING) Yes. That's why you went out with me. (LAUGHING) Finish your egg roll. Arthur. Arthur. Mmm. You'll never guess who the police just grabbed. Who? Take a guess. Warren, please. This may sound crazy, but Judge Fleming was just taken away. What do you mean "taken away"? Arrested. Come on. I'm telling you, they just arrested the judge. Your very own, favorite judge. Judge Fleming? Judge Fleming! What's the joke, Warren? There's a joke connected to this. There is no joke, Arthur. I don't know what it's all about. They're sitting hard on this thing very hard. I can't get anything from anybody. I'll see you later. Warren, let me know the... Judge, we're ready to reconvene. Be right there. Okay. (COUGHS) Congratulations, Counsel. Thank you very much. What did I do? Come here. Come in, come in. Go ahead. Judge Fleming. Yeah. I was right. He was arrested this morning and booked. We know that. But you'll never guess what for. Take a guess. Well, what for? Rape. Fleming was booked on a rape. I can't stand it. Isn't that the best? Rape! I don't believe it. That's not the best. It's not the best. Give him the punch line. No. I'm going to tell you the punch line. You're gonna love this. His people just called the office and Mr. Fleming would like you to represent him. Me? (BOTH LAUGHING) Me? (BOTH LAUGHING HARDER) Why me? I hate the son of a bitch! I'm going crazy! BATES: Mr. Kirkland, as you undoubtedly know, Judge Fleming has been accused, falsely I might add, of sexually assaulting a young lady. He wants you to represent him in this case. (LAUGHS) Excuse me. What, may I ask, is so funny? I just think it's just crazy. I don't think it sounds so crazy, not really. There are two lawyers up in the third floor men's room who think differently. As a matter of fact, one of them, right now is laughing so hard, he's choking in the sink. I'm aware that I'm not particularly well liked. But the fact remains I am innocent and I fully intend to have that proven in a court of law. Now, Mr. Bates and I feel, in this particular situation, you would be the perfect lawyer to handle my defense. What is this? The two of you got together, put your little heads together and came up with that one. That's a beauty. The real question is, why? Why me, fellas? Come on. We need you for political reasons. Political reasons? Yes. What kind of political reasons? BATES: This case will create a tremendous amount of media coverage. The animosity between you and the judge is well known. But we can use that to our advantage. Why else would you defend a man you dislike so much unless he was truly innocent? And he is, you know. Remarkable. Remarkable. But you see, personally, I don't give a shit. Why, you smug son of a bitch! Henry! Henry! Henry. I never committed a crime in my life. Judge, if you're innocent, truly innocent, you don't need me. Get yourself another lawyer. (LAUGHING) What are you laughing at? Well... I really hate to tell you this, but you remind me a little of my ex-husband. (MOCK SNORING) (LAUGHING) In what way? Because, during sex, he would always say, "Go." "Go." "Go"? Yeah. I don't say, "Go." I heard you say, "Go." No. I don't say, "Go." "Go" is dumb. I say, "God." Are you sure you didn't say, "Go"? I'm sure. I could have sworn I heard a couple of "go's" coming from you. That was, "God." I said, "Oh." It sounded like, "Go." It was, "Oh." And then I said, "God!" Oh, God! (POUNDING ON DOOR) Oh, God. Yeah? Who is it? Arthur! It's Jay. Jay? What the hell? It's my partner. Jay. It's so late. Jay? All right, all right. Jay. What do you say? Hell of a night, tonight! It's 2:00 in the morning. I know it's 2:00. The bars just closed. So, what are you doing here? I came to ask you a question. Yeah, what? I'm a good lawyer, right? Right. I got Earl Soames off. Right? What are you talking about, Jay? I got Earl Soames. I got Earl Soames! Yeah, you got him off. No, no. I just didn't get him off. I got him off on murder. And we all know that Mr. Soames did it. (TAP WATER RUNNING) Right, he did it, Jay. He was guilty. We all know that. Brilliant defense. Brilliant. Brilliant defense, Arthur. Brilliant. Right. Brilliant! Right. Brilliant! Right. Brilliant! I got him off on a technicality. I know, Jay. Right. Good. Mr. Soames did it again. What do you mean? At 12:00 tonight, he went out and he killed two kids. Jesus. I mean, he killed kids, you see. Oh, Jay. I gotta take a piss. Jay. My partner. There's women in here. Hello. Arthur, what's going on? Come on, it won't hurt you! Just duck a little! You got about three feet there. (LAUGHING) For Christ's sakes, come on, get in. How you feeling? You ready to go? Well, I thought you flew planes, you know, with wings. No, no. I've been flying helicopters ever since Korea. Come on, get in. There you are, button up. Close the door. I gotta tell you, Judge, I'm not too happy about this. Relax, Arthur. Now, just relax. Do you think maybe we could just sort of, you know, go out a bit? Not... Kind of just go and hover? We'll do any goddamn thing you want. Now, hold onto your cojones. (WHOOPING) (RAYFORD LAUGHING) Pretty, isn't it? I don't wanna talk. What? I don't want to talk! RAYFORD: Did you ever skydive? Skydive? Did you ever skydive? No. Why? You ought to try it. You might learn something. You know, I was skydiving once, and my main chute, it didn't open. I pulled my reserve, that didn't open either. There I was, plunging to the Earth. Just as I hit the treetops, I discovered the meaning of life. Which is? It sucks, Arthur. It really sucks! They used to keep Native Dancer down there. Native Dancer, the horse! Yeah. They used to keep him down there. Beautiful animal. (SIGHS) Where are we going? You wanna go someplace in particular? No! Down! I would prefer to go down. Now, just relax, Arthur. Just relax and enjoy it. The old Chinese proverb. (RAYFORD LAUGHING) (WHOOPS) (SHUDDERING) (LAUGHING) (MOANING) Great, isn't it? Oh, my, my! Yeah, let me show you something. Oh, my! Oh, my! My, my... Look at that. Wild, isn't it? (RAYFORD LAUGHING) Oh, boy. We've hit it. Hit what? What? What did we hit? The halfway point. There's a little game I play. Each time I go out, I calculate how much fuel I have and how far I can go and still get back on it. Then I figure out the halfway point, and I go just a little beyond it. (CHUCKLES) You mean, we're beyond the halfway point? Yeah. (STAMMERING) You mean we're not going to make it back? Well, maybe, maybe not. Well, land. Land! Put it down! Arthur, come on now, we're all right. If we're beyond the halfway point, Judge, we're not all right. Land! Here we go! Heading back. Sixteen years of marriage, and my wife still won't eat Chinese food. It's crazy. Especially since we met in a Chinese restaurant. How are we doing? Where are we? Are we back yet? Trust me, Arthur. I know what I'm doing. It's a protest on her behalf. She relates Chinese food to our marriage. We're not gonna make it back. We're not gonna make it back! I knew it! I knew it! We're not gonna make it back! I knew it! Arthur, look at that, huh? Didn't I tell you I got good instincts? (GRINDING) Oh. Hang on, Arthur. Hang on, now. Hang on. Get us back! Hang on, Arthur. We'll make it! (ARTHUR WHIMPERING) Hang on. Oh, God! Oh, God! Hang on. Jesus. Hang on. (ARTHUR EXCLAIMS) Home free. We almost made it right on the button. Another 90 feet. I told you I had good instincts. Come on, let's go to shore. God! Shit! My wheel. Come on, Arthur. It's easier when you take the belt off. That's it. You all right? Come on. We'll get some coffee. You'll be all right. Your adrenaline's still charged. You got to admit though, it makes you feel alive, vital. When I think that we could be dead right now, I tell you... Listen, why is everyone so preoccupied with death? I'm not usually preoccupied with it, but this certainly seems like a valid time. Wouldn't you say? How about another chicken salad sandwich? Arthur? No. Listen, let's get back to Fleming. You mean you won't even consider taking his case? Nope. Not interested. You better be interested, Arthur. Because there's some very powerful people in this town who can ruin your career. Ruin my career? What do you mean ruin my career? Well, they can have you disbarred. Do you want some more coffee? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Disbarred? What are you talking about, disbarred? Did you ever have a client named Ernest Drago? Sure. Yeah, Drago, yeah. What about him? You gave information to the police on the QT that led to his arrest and conviction. Drago was a nut! Drago was insane. He used to sit in my office and rattle off to me some of the most grotesque fantasies you can imagine. I handled him one time on a burglary charge, and I used to hear that stuff every day. He would tell me these fantasies. And one of his favorites was, what would happen if he stuck a firecracker in somebody's mouth? Yeah, that was one of his favorites. So, I read in the newspapers that there was this nut who was holding people up with a gun, forcing cherry bombs in their mouths... I knew it was Drago, so I told the police. Arthur, the specifics don't matter. By telling the police, you didn't prevent a crime. You betrayed a client. You violated the Code of Ethics. What the hell are you talking about? What the hell is going on here? Arthur, they want you. You're a very principled, ethical lawyer with no political ties. I tell you. They want me to defend Fleming because of my moral integrity, and if I don't defend him, they're gonna have me disbarred for being unethical. Look, Arthur, put aside your personal feelings. Take the case. You've worked too hard. Come on, don't throw your career away. I can't believe this. I tell you, I just don't believe it. Judge, I want McCullaugh freed. Nothing can be done. Now, I don't buy that, Judge. Just reopen the case, that's all I'm asking. Reopen the case and give me a crack at a jury. I'll get him acquitted. Now, look, you are in no position to ask for anything. But... I'll see what I can do to help. Perhaps there's an exception to the statute. Okay. Okay. So... Why don't you tell me about the girl? This Leah Shepard. Can you tell me anything about her? (SIGHS) What do you want to know? I saw her on a couple of occasions. She works over at City Hall. Did you have sex with her, first date? Yes, I did. First and second time. That's why this whole thing makes no sense to me. What do you think happened to her? I assure you that I did not rape her, but... I really don't know. Maybe some angry boyfriend showed up after I left. Angry boyfriend? That's a little mild, don't you think? I mean, she wasn't just raped, she was sadistically beaten and sodomized. That goes a little bit beyond an angry boyfriend. You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. I don't know how I get into this thing. I've been involved in the law for over 30 years and I tell you, I can't find five people out there who are willing to believe that I'm innocent. Not five of them. Would you take a lie detector test? Why? A polygraph is not admissible evidence. I know, I just... I would like you to do it for me. I'll think about it. No, no, no, no. I said that I would think about it. You can't do this. No, no. I need a polygraph to prepare your case. Now, if I'm going to be your lawyer... If you're going to be my lawyer? Mr. Kirkland, you are my lawyer. I know, I'm your lawyer, I know about that. I know that. And as your lawyer, there are certain demands I'm going to... As I've said to you before, you don't ask for anything. You don't demand anything. Now, sit down. We've got a lot of work to do. I said, sit down. Leave it out here. All right. Another one for you, my man. All right. Jeff, what happened to you? Some... Somebody beat me up. What for? I don't know. I didn't ask. Listen, Jeff, I talked to Fleming. And we're going to work something out. We're gonna get you out of here. When? Well, it's gonna take a couple weeks, Jeff. Three weeks tops. I promise you, I'll get you out by then. Three weeks? Three weeks. That's the best I can do. You have to be kidding me. It's the best I can do, Jeff. What am I suppose to do? I don't know, you're gonna have to hang in there, that's all. You're gonna have to take care of yourself. Take care of myself? Mr. Kirkland, I got myself locked up in solitary just to get away from some guys. I don't know how to fight. You read in the paper about all these guys getting let out of prison 'cause it's too crowded. And here I am and I didn't do nothing. If that don't beat all. I know, I know, I know it, Jeff. You can't lose hope. You understand me? You can't lose hope. Happy Thanksgiving. I bet we're gonna have good turkey. Of course, we're gonna have good turkey. What are you talking about? Where's your teeth? You gotta have your teeth, if you're gonna eat turkey. Where's your teeth, Grandpa? Did I have my teeth the last time you were here? Of course, you had teeth. You had teeth this morning. (CHUCKLES) He don't remember so good. What did I do with my teeth? ARNIE: He's very proud of you. He's always talking about how his grandson is gonna become a lawyer. I wish he could remember that I am a lawyer. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. What's the difference? He's still proud of you. Arnie? Yeah? You sure I had my teeth this morning? I know you had teeth. (EXCLAIMS) What's that? By the television. All right. Okay. I'm ready. I hope this friend of yours won't mind me coming. No, Arnie. No, this is Thanksgiving. It's an open house. There's gonna be a lot of people. It'll be all right. It'll be fine. Let me get this here. Okay, guys. Let's go. Let's go. I hope they don't have yams. I hate yams. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I can't eat off my knees. Mmm. What happened to sitting at a table? You say, "Pass the salt. A little more stuffing if you don't mind." Is it true that Fleming passed the polygraph test? Larry, that's privileged information. Yeah, let's just say I'm one of the privileged. He did, didn't he? What's the odds on that? Nobody wanted to believe he was innocent. I can't talk about that. I could tell this is catered. Turkey, I know. What is this? What is it? Excuse me. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead! Thank you. Go already. What is this fancy thing over here? You don't like it. You don't eat it. Ha! I bet it's yams. They're hiding the yams, so I'll eat them. Hi. How are you? Is it Jay? What? What do you think, Arthur? (PEOPLE MURMURING GREETINGS) How are you? Good to see you. How are you? How are you? Good to see you. Hello, Larry. You're an asshole. JAY: Do you like it? It came to me during the night. I gotta talk to you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Marcie, I'm coming back, and when I do, you are allowed to pet it. (MARCIE LAUGHING) So, what are you doing there? What's going on? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? What are you doing with that head? Where'd you get it? I shaved my head. What for? A change of pace. You shaved your head for a change of pace? Jay. Also, you see what it does? Arthur, listen to me. It's going to make it thick. When this comes back it's going to be thick. What's bothering you, Jay? Don't play big brother, all right? Where's that Marcie? Marcie? Will the defendant please rise? I find the defendant guilty of armed robbery. I don't understand, Mr. Kirkland, what's going on? Am I going to jail? I can't go. Your Honor, in light of the fact that this is the defendant's first major offense, that he has no prior criminal record, and that he's currently employed, I am requesting a pre-sentence investigation. You foresee a favorable probation report? Yes, Your Honor, I do. Make note that a probation report is to be drawn up and presented to this court within 15 days. Sentencing will be withheld until that time. BAILIFF: The next case... What happens now? They prepare a report, present it to the judge, and within 15 days you should be put on probation. Should be? Mr. Kirkland, I got to be. Don't worry. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. (CAR HORN HONKING) Arthur. Arthur, where you going? My office. Come on in, I'll take you. Okay. It's a new one, yeah? Yeah, do you like it? Yeah. Arthur? Yeah? I got a problem. Yeah. What? This young girl, it's... Not again, Carl. I think it's a paternity suit. (GROANS) Well... You know me, Arthur. So is Jay letting his hair grow back, or is he keeping it shaved? ARTHUR: He shaves it every day. He carries around a battery-operated razor and keeps running it over his head all day long. Jesus. Sounds pretty bad. He's not all right, is he? He's all right. He'll be all right. You know, Arthur, the committee's considering calling him in. Don't look at me like that. His clients are complaining. He's postponing his court dates, he's shaved his head. He's got a problem, you know? Look, look, look, he's all right. He's all right. You know what this whole thing comes down to, don't you? What? Every day, defense lawyers are out there protecting guilty people and getting 'em off, and they're not affected by it. That's right. Mmm-hmm. It's not supposed to affect them. Difference is that Jay was affected by it, you see? He was hurt by it. He was injured by it. I understand that, Arthur. That is not the point. All right, well, isn't it ironic that the one lawyer, the only lawyer who felt something should be brought up before your Ethics Committee? Arthur, would you please stop trying to make yourself out to being the only sensitive person around here? I know. I know Jay was hurting. I know that. That's not the point. The point is he is not functioning properly because of it. He's all right. He just needs a little time, that's all. I've taken over most of his court cases. He's putting his emphasis on contracts. Now, lay off him, okay? It's not up to me, Arthur. I'm just trying to let you know what's going on. I just love the way the hierarchy works. I mean, you're going after guys like Jay, or whoever, and nobody is doing anything about Judge Rayford, who happens to be a suicidal maniac. Rayford? Rayford. The man is bent on killing himself. It's no secret. A court bailiff found him in his chambers trying to hang himself once. You know where he spends his lunch every day? No. Outside his window, on the ledge, four stories high. Now, this is a man who's making value decisions on people's lives every day. Wait a minute, though, wait. His personal behavior is not affecting his work. He's an excellent... You know that for sure, right? Yes, I've worked with him! He's an excellent judge. And Jay's an excellent lawyer! I know he was an excellent lawyer! That's not the point. The point is his problems are affecting his ability to serve his clients. And that's why the committee wants to see him. Oh, God. You know, there are times when I'm not too sure I like you. I mean, we are so opposite, how we feel about things, Gail. Maybe that's good. That's perfect. Right? Right. As long as we just keep a little friction between us there's no problems. No problems. SHERRY: That's all the photos in the Fleming case. And here's the name and address of a witness that lives in Leah Shepard's neighborhood. He thinks you ought to see this guy. What does this say, Reisler? Risler? Reisler. Yeah, Reisler. ARTHUR: She's a little constipated, I think. She's got that look on her face. REISLER: Yeah. You say you saw somebody go into Leah Shepard's house the night she was attacked. Can you describe that person to me? Well, I'd say he was a young fella, small build. Maybe about 5'6", 5'7", something like that. Cherry? No, no, thanks. A small fella? Yeah. Would you be able to identify him if you saw him again? No. It was too dark, too far. You knew about this publicity that this case has been getting? Yeah. Newspapers about Judge Fleming and all? Oh, yeah, sure. And you knew this information, how come you didn't report it to the police? I went to the police. I went down there and told them I had information for them. And they told me to wait there on the bench. And I waited an hour, two hours, three hours. I finally turned around and went home. I left. I couldn't spend the whole night there. Do you know Leah Shepard, Mr. Reisler? Oh, to say... To wave to her, to say hello. Would you testify to what you just said in court? I guess I would if I had to. But I'll tell you, I really don't want to get involved. LAWYER: And then what happened, Officer? I told him to move on, but he continued to use profanity and he refused to leave the premises. What sort of profanity? You know, the normal kind. Officer Leary, we've all heard these words before. Now, for the record, what did he say? He used "fuck" a lot. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) And "piss on you." And said he was going to "bunghole" the short-order chef. He was going to "cream" on the waitress. Stuff like that, Your Honor. There's a very good reason for all that, Your Honor. Oh? What is that? I'm a diabetic. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) I fail to see the connection. I have never heard of diabetes causing foul language. That's because you're a douche bag. (PEOPLE LAUGHING) All right, make sure this man gets over to the hospital this afternoon for a psychiatric evaluation. I will withhold a verdict pending a medical report. Son of a bitch. Day in, day out, the same goddamn thing. Most of these people belong in a mental home, for Christ's sakes. That judge is slower than the 6:00 news. So, what can you do for me? A year. What? Are you kidding? I thought it was bargain day. Make it six months, and I think he'll buy it. All right. All right. What else you got? Fenwick. Hmm. Eighteen months. Eighteen months? Good luck. You tell him. The son of a bitch is crazy. He'd just as soon snap your neck. All right, tell him a year, but the offer's only good for today. Frank, come on. He's got beady eyes. He's a maniac. Last week, he got mad, he bit off two of his cellmate's fingers. I don't have the nerve to tell him he's got to spend a year in jail. Well, that's the best I can do. I'm just not in a good mood, you know? Frank? Yeah, here I am. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. I'll have to get back to you on Fenwick. All right. Gotta talk to you. Well, I got a case coming up here, Art. LAWYER: And then what happened, Mr. Saltzman? This punk kept pulling my wife's purse and she wouldn't let go. So I tried to get him off. He pushes me aside and then he knocks my wife into a wall. You want the good news first? Shoot. Fleming passed the polygraph. And I got an eyewitness. In that case, Your Honor, we will call the defendant, Robert Avillar, to the stand. And as far as your star witness goes, Leah Shepard... Well, we know about her and her credibility. So, you want me to throw the Fleming thing out the window, is that it, Art? I've got you by the balls, Frank. He's innocent. He's innocent. Yeah, well, if the DA's office drops this case now, everybody's gonna be screaming political deal. The old lady kept hanging on. She lets go of that purse, I'm on my way. But man, she just kept hanging on. I don't mean no harm or nothing. But you're the one that's gonna come out of this looking like a jerk. Maybe. But let me tell you something, Arthur. If this was one of your run-of-the-mill, Saturday night killings, maybe we could deal. I'm not dealing with you, Frank. This is not... This is too hot... Arthur. This is not a trade-off. Any further questions from the State? What the hell are you doing, Frank? It's a dream. It's a dream come true, Art. You're not going to spoil it. When I get Fleming down, I'm gonna tear him up and crucify him. My client, Mr. Avillar, has no prior criminal record. He merely wanted to take her money. It's the Super Bowl, Art. It's the Super Bowl, and I'm the quarterback. And there's three seconds left to go, and I draw back to pass and there's a touchdown! Fleming's carried out on a stretcher. It's that big, Art. FEMALE JUDGE: I find you guilty. But I'm not going to jail you. I'm placing you on probation for one year. One year probation? What kind of punishment is that? People are getting real pissed off at the law these days, Art. And I can turn that to my advantage. FEMALE JUDGE: Remove this man from the court. You're gonna find yourself representing the sacrificial lamb. SALTZMAN: This is justice? What kind of a world do we live in? A meshuggenah world? FEMALE JUDGE: Take him out, please! SALTZMAN: You're crazy! The whole world is crazy! Meshuggenah, crazy! (EXCLAIMS) (ALL MURMURING) What's going on? What's happening? It's Jay Porter. He's gone completely crazy. Jay! Jay! (PLATE CLATTERING) Jay! It's me. Arthur! (EXCLAIMS) (PLATE SHATTERING) Where the hell did he get the plates? From the cafeteria. He's been bringing them up all morning. Nobody paid any attention to him. No. He's not armed. He doesn't have... What's he got? He's got plates. Plates? (CHATTERING) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) Put that goddamn thing away. What's going on? That guy back there. He's not armed. He's just throwing a bunch of plates around. Plates? (SHATTERING) Does anybody know who this guy is? Yeah, Jay. It's Jay Porter. He's a lawyer. He's my partner. A lawyer? Mr. Porter! Here. No, wait. No, no, here, hold this. I'm gonna rush him. You all right? Yes. Fine. Screw this. Get some canisters. We'll gas him out. Oh, Christ! What do you say I run interference? Huh? What do you mean? Well, I got this. Now, you stay right on my tail, all right? All right, judge coming through! Jay, it's me, Arthur! Jay! Jay. Jay, listen to me. Jay, listen to me. Come on. Jay. Come on, help me. Come on! No! I'm not ready. I'm not ready. No! I'm not ready! I'm not ready to try this case. I'm not ready. I'm not ready, Judge! Please, please, Judge! No, help me, help me, help me! (SCREAMS) Warren, could you do me a favor? 3:00, Courtroom A. My client, Ralph Agee. They're just gonna review his probation report. They screwed up the report and I made these corrections. Make sure the judge sees it. Okay? No, problem. You'll be in and out in five minutes. He'll be wearing a blond wig, so don't let it throw you. It makes him happy. Yeah, go ahead, Arthur. Tell Agee I'll call him tonight and I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Okay. Okay. (SIREN WAILING) I drew up the contract. I did all the work. I just wanted you to review it. So I reviewed it. For a $7,000 fee? Christ, doctors treat each other for nothing. Where's some professional courtesy? Screw the courtesy, this is business. Besides, I got the lunch. Oh, come on, Warren. Oh, my God, Arthur's case. I forgot all about it. Look, I'll see you later, all right? What are we waiting for? For Arthur Kirkland, Your Honor. Sentencing on Ralph Agee. Check the halls. See if he's lost. Yes, sir. Okay, let's move on here. I'm sorry I'm late, Your Honor. I'm filling in for Mr. Kirkland. I'm not going to permit this type of conduct in the future. When you're due in my court at 3:00, I expect you here at that time. Yes, Your Honor. All right, let's get on with it. I have a copy of Ralph Agee's probation report in front of me. Mr. Fresnell, are you familiar with this report? Yes, I am, Your Honor. (STAMMERING) Who are you? Mr. Kirkland asked me to handle this for him. Don't worry. Routine affair. You'll be out of here in a second. Mr. Fresnell, is there anything you'd like to say about this report? I think it's all right there in front of you, Your Honor. Well, I'm not satisfied. Ralph Agee, will you stand before the court? Stand up. On the... And take off that wig. On the basis of this report, I sentence you to a term of three years in the custody of the Department of Corrections. Mr. Kirkland said I'd be out on probation. Mr. Kirkland... Mr. Kirkland said I'd be out on probation! Your Honor, I'd like you to call your attention to some corrections that should've... JUDGE: You are familiar with the proper proceedings for appeal. Now, I'd like to move things along here. BAILIFF: We have another case for your attention, Your Honor. State of Maryland v. Della. (TIRES SCREECHING) What are you, crazy? Arthur! My car, Arthur, damn you! Back off, Arthur, damn it! Watch out for the car. Arthur, knock it off! For crying out loud. What are you, nuts? Get out! For Christ's sake, stop it, Arthur! Get out! Back off and I'll get out. What the hell is wrong with you? What do you think you're doing to my car? Tell me about it. You tell me about Agee. Come on, Warren, tell me about it. It got by me. It got by you? It got by you? It got by you! God damn it! Jesus! Now, listen. Just stay away from the car! Agee did not have to go to jail! Do you understand? He did not have to go to jail! He gets out on probation in 10 months! Listen, that's not all my fault! You know I don't like those penny ante bullshit cases. I was doing you a favor. Favor! What kind of favor? It's nickel and dime, Arthur! It's all nickel and dime! Don't you care, Warren? Don't you even care? If you cared so much, why weren't you in the courtroom? You're goddamn right I care. But not about them. They're people, Warren. You know? They're people. They're just people. If he's not in jail this week, he'll be in jail next week. Arthur, goddamn it, you know probation's are faulted. Appeal it. I can't appeal it. He's dead. He's dead! Half hour after they put him in the lockup, he hanged himself. God damn it! I'm sorry. God damn it! I'm sorry! God damn it. (WATER LAPPING) Judge? Judge! Yeah. I... I spoke with the state's attorney's office, and they're gonna go ahead with an indictment. Who'd you talk to? Bowers. Frank Bowers. Well, he's right. If we don't go into court on this, it could look like a political maneuver. I want everything out in the open. I'm very pleased, Arthur. Yeah. Okay. What about McCullaugh? I need your ruling on my motion for a new trial. What about it, Judge? The groundwork is all prepared. We should have a date anytime now. What are you talking about, groundwork? What are you doing, Judge? Jerking me off here? All I need is a "yes" or a "no" on my motion. Tell McCullaugh to be patient. "Patient"? What did you say? "Patient"? What are you talking about, "patient"? Judge. Judge, this is not a case of monetary damages. Judge, this is a human being we're talking about, okay? This is a boy who's in prison, frightened out of his mind, fighting every day for his life. I can't tell him to be patient. Good. Prison should be a frightening place. Let those criminals create their own hellhole. Are you crazy? What are you talking to me about? I'll tell you, Arthur. The idea of "punishment to fit the crime" doesn't work. We need unjust punishment. Hang somebody for armed robbery. Try it! We've got nothing to lose. Do you understand what I'm saying to you, for God's sake? You don't, do you? You fellas with your fancy ideas of rehabilitation. I tell you that the concept of rehabilitation is a farce. You would honestly think that bringing Johnny Cash into prison to sing railroad songs is going to rehabilitate anyone? Most people are sick and tired of mugging and crime in the streets. Do you hear what I'm telling you, Arthur? Arthur? Arthur! OFFICER: Come on, let's move. Let's go. MALE REPORTER 1: Sir, could you tell us what's going on? MALE REPORTER 2: Could you please give us a statement? How many hostages are there? (SIREN WAILING) (ALL CLAMORING) OFFICER: Move back. MALE REPORTER 3: How many hostages is he holding? Here, you take the back. Yeah. WARDEN: The clinic doctor felt he was well enough to be sent back to his cell and was signing the release papers. I'm not sure what happened, but all of a sudden, McCullaugh had a gun. These guards, I don't know where they come from! No training, no education. Motivation? Forget it. I hope you got this thing under control. I don't want anything crazy... We're doing what we can. We can't sit on this for long. There are too many goddamn criminals in this building! Open up. Get those nurses off the floor. Excuse me, Warden. I'm sorry, but I couldn't hold onto him any longer, he had to go back. "He had to." Look, that's not even the point. I'm surprised he's even awake in there. I loaded him up on tranqs just before it was time for him to leave. Jeff? Jeff! JEFF: Yeah? It's me, Jeff, Arthur. Hi, Mr. Kirkland. Hi. JEFF: How you doin'? Pretty good. How are you doin'? I'm all right. Can I come in here a little further, Jeff? Where are you? I'm out here in the hallway. JEFF: I can't see you. You can't see me? Can you see me now? Uh-uh. I'm over here, Jeff, in the hallway. Can you see me? Can you see me? Could I come in, you think? Um... Yeah, I guess so. Okay, I'm coming in. So, what's new? (ARTHUR CHUCKLES) You know, the usual. Business. Oh, man. Jeff. This is crazy. You know? I know. I mean, me taking hostages. That's what's really crazy. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. It took me 40 minutes to tie these guys up 'cause I couldn't figure out how to make a good knot. I mean, would you know how to do that? I don't know, I guess I would... I... I don't know. I guess you make a square knot, and that's the easiest. I don't know. Would you, like, take a look to see if I did these okay? Yeah, sure, Jeff. Yeah. Look at the knot. Well, you sure tied them. They're good knots, Jeff. Tell them not to come in here! I don't want anybody in here! Get out! Get out! (EXHALES) Oh, Jeff. Oh, Jeff. Now, look. Jeff, you can't win this thing. You understand me? You can't win. Jeff, this is their thing. They gear up for this kind of thing, Jeff. Please. I can't stand it anymore. They raped me. A whole bunch of times. And other stuff, too. OFFICER: All right. Take your positions. (JEFF SOBBING) (WHISPERING) Hey, Jeff. Jeff. Jeff! Can I move closer? Jeff? Can I move a little closer? I guess so. Just down here. I want to talk to you. Jeff. Hey. Listen to me, Jeff. I don't know what to tell you. I just don't know what to tell you. Anything I tell you, you know? It's just that you gotta give up. Give up? Yeah. To who? Yeah, Jeff. You gotta do it. Everybody screwed me. Who else is there? Would you go away, please? Oh, Jeff. That's all I want, is just this much free space. Just this much, that's all I want. I swear to God, Jeff. I swear to God, it'll be all right. You did what you could, Mr. Kirkland, but nothing makes sense anymore. Not in here. What are you going to do, Jeff? Nothing. I don't have to do anything. (POLICE RADIO CHATTERING) You can't just sit there, Jeff. Yes, I can! That's all I want to do, is just sit here. Okay. It's cold in here. You want my coat, Jeff? My legs. Oh, God. My legs are cramping so bad I can hardly... I'll give you my coat. Ow! Stay down! (SCREAMING) (PANTING) (CHATTERING) (HONKING) Hey, Arthur. Come on in. It's Sunday, Carl. Come in, I want to show you something. What's up? Hey, your partner's coming back, I hear. Yeah. They're gonna let him practice again? Sure. Why not? Well... Who says you gotta be sane to practice law? (CARL LAUGHING) Come on, Carl, what's going on? What do you want? I got a little present for you. You know, favor for favor. Sweetheart, give him the pictures. CARL: There you have it. It's the head of the Ethics Committee, Judge Fleming and the hooker. She takes a good picture, huh? (CARL LAUGHING) What do you think? That take care of my legal fees for the next two years? Carl. Take the pictures. It's a token of my appreciation. Oh, my, my. Look, Arthur... Come on, these photographs are disgusting, but they're not proof that Fleming raped Leah Shepard. He did it. The son of a bitch is guilty. He's guilty. Okay. Okay. Then drop the case. I can't. Why not? Because the man with the whip is blackmailing me. He's blackmailing you? Yeah. What for? A long time ago, I betrayed a client's confidence. It's a long story, Gail. I don't believe this. That's why Zinoff pulled your file. What do you mean? After you walked out on the committee, we did a check on you. A check on me? Yeah. Yeah. Zinoff requested it. I had no idea why. Wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me, while we were sleeping together, you and the fellas were making decisions on my life? Arthur. Gail, on my life? Would you just let me finish, please? The next thing I knew, Zinoff stepped in, he said he wanted to personally review your case. I swear to God, Arthur, I had no idea. Jesus, this whole thing stinks! Okay, Arthur, if you feel that way about it, then fight him. Go ahead, go up against him, take the consequences. The consequences? The consequences are that I'll be disbarred, Gail. I know that. That's right. I'm a lawyer. It's all I know. Then do it. Defend Fleming. You'll win the case. No disbarment, right? You'll end up being a very important lawyer. A judge is guilty of beating and raping a woman. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, Arthur. You're talking crazy, now. You don't know he's guilty. You're making an assumption he's guilty because you hate him so much, right? Even if he is, what difference does it make? Come on. A defense lawyer has to defend people who are guilty. You know that. Would you defend him? If you're me, would you do it? I would, Arthur, 'cause it's my job, you know? Look. You took an oath to defend your clients to the best of your ability. Now, if you can't do that, then get out. Where'd you get these? I've been carrying them around for a couple of days. I'd like to know what they mean. I see the wheels spinning. Sex photos, sex crime. Is he guilty? Is he? Yes. What about the polygraph? The eyewitness? How'd you do that? Those were taken care of for me. So... So, now you have it. Well, I'll see you in court, Arthur. Oh. You forgot these. So, you're home on leave. Arthur's in the Coast Guard. I don't understand. He's getting worse. It depends. He comes, he goes. You didn't come for three weeks. He missed you very much. Oh, you know, I was... I was busy, Arnie. You know, I had the trial and all. Getting ready. I know, I know. It's important to you. But you missed three Tuesdays, so he lost his sense of time. You know, Arnie, I don't know what I'd do if he goes. He's the only family I got. He's very proud of you. I'm a lawyer because of him. He wanted it for me. And he made sure he got it. To him, being a lawyer was the finest thing you could be. (ARTHUR SIGHS) (KNOCKING) RAYFORD: Wait a... Your Honor, court's about to begin. (COUGHING) Coming. Coming. (COUGHING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) You must admit she's an attractive woman. I wouldn't mind seeing her again sometime. FRANK: You'll be fine. Take the stand, answer simply and directly. Silence. All rise. All persons having matters before this court, draw near and give your attention. The Honorable Francis Rayford presiding. (COUGHING) Be seated. So, it's really very simple. We have a judge, the symbol of justice here, who's accused of raping and brutally beating this young girl, right here. Now, we can do something about it, and we can do it today, and we can do it together. Now, let's make this our goal line stand. Just give me a verdict of guilty. I need your help. Thank you. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) Prosecutor has completed his opening statement. Defense counsel ready? Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor, Mr. Foreman, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my name is Arthur Kirkland, and I am the defense counsel for the defendant, Judge Henry T. Fleming. Now, that man over there, he's the prosecuting attorney. And he couldn't be happier today. He is a happy man today because today he's going after a judge. And if he gets him... If he gets him, he's gonna be a star. He's going to have his name in this month's Law Review, centerfold, "Lawyer of the Month." (PEOPLE SNIGGERING) Now, in order to win this case, he needs you. Naturally. You're all he's got, believe me. So, he's counting on tapping that emotion in you which says, "Let's get somebody in power. Let's get a judge." However, these proceedings are not about that. These proceedings are here to see that justice is done. And justice is, as any reasonable person would tell you, the finding of the truth. And what is the truth today? One truth, a tragic one, is that that girl has been beaten and raped. Another truth is that the prosecution doesn't have a witness. Does not have one piece of substantiating evidence other than the testimony of the victim herself. Another truth is that my client voluntarily, and the prosecution is well aware of this fact, voluntarily took a lie detector test... Objection, Your Honor. That's inadmissible evidence. Come on, Arthur. He told the truth. The jury will disregard that remark. Polygraph tests have not been proven 100% reliable. Therefore, inadmissible in a court of law. Sorry, Your Honor. Let's get back to justice. What is justice? What is the intention of justice? The intention of justice is to see that the guilty people are proven guilty and that the innocent are freed. Simple, isn't it? Only it's not that simple. However, it is the defense counselor's duty to protect the rights of the individual as it is the prosecution's duty to uphold and defend the laws of the state. Justice for all. Only we have a problem here, and do you know what it is? Both sides wanna win. We wanna win. We wanna win regardless of the truth. And we wanna win regardless of justice. Regardless of who's guilty or innocent. Winning is everything. That man there wants to win so badly today. It means so much to him. He is so carried away with the prospect of winning, the idea of it, that he forgot something that's absolutely essential to today's proceedings. He forgot his case. He forgot to bring it. I don't know. I don't see it. Do you? The prosecution's case. He's got to have one. Not a witness. Not one piece of substantiating evidence other than the testimony of the victim herself. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I have a case to end all cases. I have witnesses for my client. I have character references, testimonials that are backed up from here to Washington, D.C. I got lie detector tests that... Objection! Objection! RAYFORD: Objection sustained. Sit down, Frank. Mr. Kirkland, you are out of order! (BREATHING HEAVILY) One thing that bothered me, the one thing that stayed in my mind, and I couldn't get rid of it, that haunted me, was why? Why would she lie? What was her motive for lying? If my client is innocent, she's lying. Why? Was it blackmail? No. Was it jealousy? No. Yesterday, I found out why. She doesn't have a motive. You know why? Because she's not lying. (PEOPLE MURMURING) And ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the prosecution is not going to get that man today! No. Because I'm gonna get him. My client, the Honorable Henry T. Fleming, should go right to fucking jail! The son of a bitch is guilty! (PEOPLE MUTTERING IN DISBELIEF) ARTHUR: That man is guilty. Mr. Kirkland! That man there, that man, is a slime. He is a slime! If he's allowed to go free, then something really wrong is going on here. RAYFORD: Mr. Kirkland, you are out of order! You're out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order! They are out of order! That man, that sex-crazy... RAYFORD: All right, clear the courtroom! That crazy man raped and beat that woman there! And he'd like to do it again, he told me so. It's just a show. It's a show! It's Let's Make a Deal. Let's Make a Deal. Hey, Frank, you wanna make a deal? I got an insane judge who likes to beat the shit out of women. What do you want to give me, Frank? Three weeks' probation? Damn it! Did you hear what I said? You son of a bitch, you! You're supposed to stand for something. You're supposed to protect people. But instead you fuck and murder them. You killed McCullaugh! You killed him! Hold it! Hold it! I've just completed my opening statement! (WHISTLES) All right! (GAVEL BANGING) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) RAYFORD: Clear the courtroom! Oh, shit. The judge says, "Now, you won the trial." So, now the guy's doing two to ten. Can you believe something... Hi, Arthur.
