Monsieur does not have his loyalty card. Please follow me sir. Yes if I have it I forgot it in my other pants. Yes of course and coincidentally. You changed your pants just today. Well yes I was alone. To listen to Monsieur, we stop playing the mariole. You follow me please. you realize that we surprised him. I'm not a frozen bandit. Calm down. Put down, however, and everything will be fine. I tell you that I forgot it in my other pants sir listen. Don't make me roll backwards. Don't. Don't approach. The term. To notify the police. Pierre and Martine hello thank you for answering our questions. As a neighbor of the fugitive would you say it's total misunderstanding. Ah yes the total misunderstanding would you say there is stupor too. Oh yes stupor yes. Would you say that you feel a growing climate of insecurity? Oh yes. We feel a growing climate of insecurity with a form of fed up on your part, I imagine. Ah yes a form of fed up yes a. Lost. I didn't say how about you. Yeah. Is it. We are not going to. Search apart from me. Bathroom Yes. Toilet. Yes. Kitchen Yes. In the sofa. No. Consider going to see. Now. OK. Behind. Sweetheart. What went through your mind. I don't understand. This morning I changed my pants. How to get my loyalty card. My phone must have rang. No excuses. The settings info I have rarely seen. One please. You can tell her that her daddy looks cool. Madam I will ask you please. OK. This forum is yours. Your husband is that. OK. To all. The suspect went back home I repeat the suspect went back home and must be not far away we keep an eye out. And you, Mrs I'm going to ask you delicately to put this leek on the ground. Very well. I get up without a sudden gesture. The suspect was seen fleeing in an orange vehicle the world of cinema has been in turmoil since witnesses reportedly recognized Fabrice the actor of comedy law enforcement paid tribute to the courage of the security guards claimed to have forgotten him in his other pants so when they said. Fifty meters away turn left. Turn left. Two hundred meters take the second exit by a pass. A hundred meters away. Take the second exit. Direction. The central police station what. I said. Direction. Central police station. Please turn around and surrender to the police sure. I'll have to take drastic measures OK. Driver's refusal to comply. Stopping the vehicle seated facing vehicle stop. Arab dressed. Of the vehicle. Ap. Here, Roselyne. It's good. Thanks Severine. Some tweets. If you need to talk we're here you know. If it's true. Experience you had there now you have to try to forget and for that there is time. Ted I should go to the fish market for a while. No. We don't follow that Roseline. You must stay strong. Hello. Hair color you can leave a message I will call you back. Nobody. Yes. Celine Fabrice please call me back it's urgent hello i always answered in summary you can leave me a message I will call you back. Yes Céline is still Fabrice there listening to his accounts you don't remind me what it was super important when I still wanted to say that. I build more battery in any case to excel in the frame. Of a relation case number chaos then it is zero six ten the erosions. Call me back don't hesitate. Celine I'm fine, I can't reach you. I can't talk too loud I'm in projection. Listen, it's good that you pick up because what I have to say is a bit tricky, we won't be able to work with you anymore, well that has nothing to do with what's going on at the moment. You see what I told you by dint of doing comedies although it happens one day. Listen to me in your place I would take a few days off. Now. well yes now and never an ideal moment Fabrice. But we are in our zone. I don't know how to be in lozère. Lozere is perfect no one will find you there. Social media right now is. Ok but wait wait Céline Celine. Celine. He has a record Fabrice the guy on the run. To put your kitchen stuff. Shell. Not. Uh. We. Can help. You say that because I look like a repressed homosexual, that's it. But not at all because I'm kidding. I'm sending the suspect's port to forensic science. No need, we know who the suspect is, there are plenty of witnesses who saw him at the supermarket. Yes. It's Fabrice comedian in humorous films. I'll tell them what now forensic science. I. Don't know when you're going to tell them it's no longer worth doing the tests. According to that. I invent something. It's good. Oh. Yes. Yes hello ma'am. Yes, that was to let you know that there are young people from sensitive neighborhoods who have fun sending leeks everywhere. So here it is if you receive a leek it does not come from us that's thank you very much madam sending. A map. Working. To repair. But you Florence who had twice shared the poster with Fabrice doomed you from your colleague. Go slowly to the gasoline if you want it the police and the justice of our country do its work and let's not have double standards. Two weights, two measures excellent. So you go you and all your profession to support your colleague. Who we are I always remember without news a tea party was a little early to talk about a concerted action I mean the charges are serious anyway. Not go faster than the music faster than music. Also. So no solidarity in sight. Look far away there. A lone hitchhiker. what are we doing we take it we crush it. I have. Awareness. Lost. Thanks, that's nice. Target. How are you. I won the facts. And for what purpose. I waited waited. Excuse me but would you mind singing with us because. It's a bit like the dynamics of going on vacation there. Sure. I'm waiting to leave for a week. I don't know the song. It's stopping. Not the song lyrics. Bottom. But don't you fear that we will stigmatize the community of actors as a whole. You know I have always remembered this sentence that my grandmother repeated. The stones do not always have the same. Shadow. Richelle wet. You are a respected film critic concretely with Fabrice what type of actor are we dealing with. Look, it looks like we're here with a representative from the comedy industry. humor i.e. clarified for our viewers who for the most part come from working classes. And don't understand half of what they say. Well, it's a current of actors inspired by everyday situations. and deforms them in such a way as to relax the legs in some cases make them smile falling on their festive I imagine Yes or no. Saying knees. This could explain in part. Why he forgot his loyalty card in his other pants yes you don't have what I said but we could all the same suppose it but. You absolutely don't know if we're going to listen to Fabienne's very moving statement again. France's most wanted fugitive Fabrice's wife. And then we'll come back to the set to see if some of you circle around. Fabrice if you listen to us. I beg you go to the competent authorities the evidence. And the testimonies are overwhelming. And I can only be in solidarity with the forces of order. At the same time flees Fabrice then. I will make sure that Gérard, our son, can grow up with the image. That you have always been for man. Me there is no coincidence. It's all crystal clear. Obviously. Who says loyalty card. Loyalty. Who says adultery crime life. So air. Utility says. Fork. Kratos. Kratos. You. Who say you say. It's that simple. It heats up very quickly. Will talk about it. Time I want to make a trade. That's for sure. Saconnex is good for advancement. Unless they have moved to the peri-urban zone. By car. It would be amazing. Good evening. Three. I do not know. No the problem is not the case. Paul. No no it's not like that. The eyebrows are thicker. Where. Then the lips look thinner. Glasses nope. No, no glasses. I the. Recommended. So much because. What I feel flowing. He's my favorite actor. I don't trust well played. I stop. The. This is for the after sequence. But so. You told her. Show one franc per open fly pass a militant act for you I said despair Hello Florence. Ah. It's frank. Tell me what is this story about. Support for Fabrice. Returned the press campaign the platform in the logitech world the news channels on a loop it is. Why am I not in the loop myself. It's the same at every competition. What I'm not doing enough entry is your children. Hi It's okay. Hmm yeah. Thank you when we mile end please. Foyer de Fabrice have no ok okay so he knows about it. Look in your spam. In any case If you need me. You can count on me. Besides, we could perhaps imagine a joint action no. French cinema finally reunited all tendencies. Left right. Vegan. Vegan. What are you thinking of the Just. I don't know but I was like maybe we could do something new. Something that marks and that comes out of the ordinary no. A self-immolation. I a coffee. Good. Moreover. I. Do. Needs a hell of a mess in the work on the western section. No work on the western section. No. you must then perhaps confused with. Bypass. The only card. We have it. Warned. That he who. It's a little nightmare yes we act we can't. Is called a quartering. In the middle Ages he submitted. Horrible there were men everywhere. You see who died. If the flute is brave, it is quite possible. She fears. Ah thank you stop no but it was to tell you that I did not want to take you their I'm quite individualistic and I prefer to stay alone and listen to my music quietly rather than hire a conversation with someone I don't know. So. Of course we think it happens to me too. Go have a nice day. So the children who can explain to me what is tolerance. No not you malek yes play. Tolerance is acceptance. Even if they are not like us. As dad will say. Exactly like the father of Gerard the fugitive we are talking about. Is it but like us Gérard's dad. He's not Gérard's dad like us, okay, but should we reject him? however no. And so now who can tell me what discrimination is. Yes she is. Discrimination when we judge these people like no other just like Gérard's dad, for example. Who can tell me now what democracy is nope. Yours. How did we get here. Has man become so inhuman. To reject one of his own. Because it is different. What is all this for. A moment of inattention. Because that's the meaning of life to always be aware of what we are. The responsibility that entails. Is this the end of recklessness. What am I going to do with my city. No. Maybe I deserved it all. Because one day or another we pay for our faults it is inevitable. No one can escape the relentless machine which has become his destiny. Neither you. Neither you nor you the big one. We are all in the same boat. We have just learned that Franck actor seen several times alongside Fabrice has set himself on fire in support of his colleague Martin brossard you are there. Yes indeed then it is a classic immolation the comedian posted himself this morning in the middle of this place on which I stand at the moment and he set himself on fire with a lighter he had borrowed from an honest passer-by on his way to work. Hello commissioner come get me. Hello it is the prefect who sends us to take you back to service exceptionally please. Still. But this time he said I promise it's the last time. The last time I was already the last. Yeah but then he must have promised that we're really sorry but it's because you're the last retired commissioner still active, it's my luck. I can finish my beer of course commissioner. No. Good week-end. We're going to start all over again. You have received the lab results for the leek. Result is leek. We received them. Do that Antoine you told me not to. Do it and he told me it's not worth it because we already know who it is. Right away. Whether it's true you told me that. So if I tell you to fuck off that is to say let's do it you do Having it already is irrelevant. Because the staplers already it will be stapled Broadway. It's funny because I see the relationship very well now, I don't see anything. at not the witness is ready. Good. You die. Story of a serious little one you lost the stapler again in Angola. This is. Thanks to him. Just be. Calm. To roll backwards. We have to stretch on the ground. Turn the neck to one side and pass the legs to the other side. In this way we turn through the shoulder. What will not hurt in the head. Thank you for coming so quickly. Our testimony will be precious to us it's normal. I warn you. Not terrible cheek upside down because I haven't seen lots of funny people like you. They didn't all come out in full. OK. Suggest something a tea a coffee not and I would like a small glass of water. In. My heart. Nevertheless. Of great quality we have. Started this stream. Everything is fine everything is fine. You know I have nothing against you. Just here to try to understand a bit. OK. Usually you are two to do that. I have. Ordered understaffed. Forgotten make understood angry. So. Like I told you on the phone, I'm not going to be able to keep your son. I listened to the radio again this morning, we're talking about that. It's true. Parents of students are afraid that the presence of your son don't give them ideas. You have to understand them. Excuse me. Yes hello. Yes. Oh that's fun. Yes. No, because I'm currently working on it. Yes. Very well. Have a good day. But the exclusion would be final. So. Temporary. Firstly. And then final. So. Thanks. Without transition we talk about Fabrice the comedy actor who is still actively sought by the police. The Minister of the Interior assures that he is doing everything to find him. During his meeting in Lyon he asked the French I quote not to give in to a psychosis that has no place to be excuse me darling. You have it for a long time. Until eight thirty five. Ah okay so where every night it's the same what exactly at dinner time while still untraceable. A. Little hit every night on the horizon, we also learn that Henry, Fabrice's new film, will be released as planned despite the growing number of requests. ban filed by various non-profit organizations. Henry is a weird title. Why do you say that. Upside down. It's a long way. Rays. Nothing. Who says nothing says nothing. All. That all d. Sore throat. Sore throats. Deep throats. deepthroat said seiya who said he said sullen. And who says sullen says. Jewish. Not all the demonstrators arrived early this morning in front of this cinema and without preventing spectators from entering the room they took them to task in a sometimes violent way among these demonstrators the collective we walk on the head came to show their discontent so what. Because we are a comedy actor you can forget your loyalty card in your other pants one day. And release a new movie with impunity the next day. Thermal media recovery. John kerry a real killer I love with Hugo. You know that these days I prefer stay here but why. Because with this prowling actor. Imagine that Tina. Leave those crates in a basement putting things in your buttocks but what as an object. I personaly do not know. Perrier bottles for example. But. From two to five. A. Small ones. Thirty-three centilitres. You scare me. Same analysis five. You imagine. Hmm. Jacques. Nothing. The fugitive was spotted in a village in Lozère. Only that we warn the guys on the spot. There is one among you who talks loser nothing. I have a friend who went to college. Talked to each other loser nothing no it was science college. Thanks to. Disruption of the Algerian. I have family to quimp. And. You could tell. The fugitive is in your sector, you take over. I should give. The fugitive in your area. Take over. All. Commissioner side that. Are you bored to make the phone call since. I did not understand anything. Get out something. Next. It's good. You did a test. During my sultan. Connected to his search. Also a heart brain. I know it's difficult. Sultan is dead and employed for seven years. You accept it. To eat. If a bro. Just moved a bit. It's a conspiracy on that. Hello. Fabian. Away will sing Benjamin. You recognized enchanted it's very nice of you to have agreed to meet me. Good. So. As you know I was chosen to play the role of your husband. In the film that will be adapted from these events. Since I couldn't meet him, I thought that maybe you could give me a few keys. I'm not sure I can be of help to you. do you have any news from Fabrice. Always not. His home charger. When I met him. I always forgot it's Clear that's interesting for me. Follow me. You want a little bit of this football mania I note I note. I do not mind thank you. He always forgot his means always what. Go well. I. You know. I never judge the characters I ever play. Had nothing to fear. However, I need to understand. Attached acts for example you would do exactly the same. You would make a super Nazi. Everyone says it. Thanks Fabien. Sophie allibert. Mom. Sophie Guy alibert you're at college André bourvil in eighty five eighty six. My indeed but if we are together in fourth Fabrice. Ah. But if I always had a v-neck sweater with a brown undershirt underneath that made a big face and brown sweatpants that hug the thighs with a chic little elastic band which passes under the soles of the feet so that will not go. And you, you haven't had fun crossing the yard with your girlfriend Sandrine fresh or doing back and forth you walk slowly side by side high making sure that your steps are regulated to the millimeter it was like a ballet I could have spent hours watching this. I thought it was super ripe for me to cross the yard like that talking in the middle of all these people who were running and fighting and playing football. Half I was making scenarios and then I imagined that you were talking to him about me. You told him that. That you couldn't look at me. Because otherwise everyone would understand that you were in love with me. But you wanted that to remain a secret, a secret between Sandrine Frémeaux and you. That's why you never looked at me. And I repeat to you mentally that if you could look at me the others would see nothing. Because I spent my days in class looking at you from three-quarters back. That's why the day where m basset asked me about the year of the beginning of the fifth republic I answered something that had nothing to do. Because in fact I had not listened to the question. Because I who speak I was thinking of you. And I imagined you kissing me behind the fir trees with your eyes closing. So it's crazy because you see even today we would ask the year of the beginning of the fifth Republic. I wouldn't know what to say it's when you say it's a date I'll never do. Because She is parasitized for life by this image of you kissing me. Behind the fir trees. With closing eyes. I remember. It's true. This is a sport that had trouble climbing the rope and Philippe Gomez had gone down jogging. And we had seen the heart stop and all the humans had died of laughter. Yeah here it is. That next. Cost steps forward. I'm an actor but I make movies. Sorry. You are known. Because did not TV with my husband. It's a choice for us. We don't read either, we live in a big house near Marie-Claire that my husband and I have finished paying due to our uncomfortable financial situation. You have time to come and have a drink. Yes yes and pleasure. I'll call you back. Unbelievable. Weak Fabrice. So little. Father. Hmm. Beginning. Fabienne where. It's love at first sight, it seems. No, but it's true. This photo. On the cover of every magazine. Started it all. It's love at first sight looks like no. We said to ourselves. With Benjamin. If it's in the newspaper. It is that it is true. But of course Lugo was only a bit obligated. To love each other. Hello. So. I feel like it's love at first sight for both of them. Where. And you Benjamin then you see and you. You you Benjamin do you think it will last I I hope so, in any case, I love this role. Fabienne is a woman. Exceptional. Who doesn't like it, which makes it even more exceptional. Slipping into the role of her husband was easy. And then Ben precisely and how. You familiarize yourself with familiarity. How do you plan to prepare for your role? As per usual. In total immersion. And you Gerard. You're happy to have a new dad. My little piece of cabbage. My son. Fellow. Jean-Pierre, I present to you Fabien, he is a college friend that I bumped into will enchant Fabien. Hold on. Well, I knew a Fabien a. But he was from Tarbes. TO. That tells you nothing. No no I don't see. A big. Big. No. But if his mother ran a clothing store. No no I'm sorry I can't. Must not say that you are from Tarbes. I don't think I ever mentioned forgiveness. I suggest that we take a drink to compensate for an atmosphere that is a little difficult to take downright. Go on. We. Valued Jean-Pierre is an engineer in exothermics of macromolecular bonds by thermosetting polymerization and crystallization an isotherm in a cryo-biological environment within you. More exactly, these engineers in exotherm of macromolecular bonds. By thermosetting polymerization and crystallization an isotherm in a cryoprotective medium. Ah. My darlings you always have to devalue yourself but it's true. But if now it's of a year is written to the protector look at me. I wanted. Just that he writes to the protector nothing. Coached. By their coach. This. Ain't risk like that. He should. That you devalue yourself. So. This is devaluing. Good. More than that. Not. TO. Not. Ha. Ha ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. And you make movies. Yes. And what kind of movie. Look, I mostly do comedy movies. Coach a lot of people who don't mind, it's us. Yes. For me everyone. Even his existence as he sees fit. If we still vote socialist in my heart. You can also tell him that here we are in an eco-responsible House exactly so we are not the type to judge such and such on what makes the profession no kind of importance to us we even have a friend who makes African jewelry you can only tell him. And you know when I told you that Jean-Pierre was an exothermic engineer for macro molecular houses by thermosetting polymerization. Using an isotherm in a cryo-biological medium. It's absolutely not to make you uncomfortable cryo protector. When. These protective crimes have an I say what biological cryo. You know. I cried myself too much, you are wrong. You will do. In. Big. What happens when you're wrong. We have. Someone. So. This is the impulse. No. Ah. Not. True. We're going to change that. Who goes to the rich. The House is surrounded by police during this change of students in disguised hypokhâgne for hazing. Yeah. You are in hypokhâgne. I don't say not that. You are the one looking. What did you do. Make a denim jacket with the sleeves rolled up that's it no no not at all my angel I actually go shopping. I did not have my loyalty card. No, but I forgot it in my other pants, you dare vomit, top quality. But. I don't know what he's holding back. Coming from sustainable agriculture immediately on site we find Martin brossard Martin what we know one little more than it is. Listen to laetitia no when i'm talking to you we don't know what's going on it could very well be a hostage taking. But we have no information in this direction for the moment and if hostage taking there was there is no indication at the moment of the number of hostages involved Martin could there be children among the hostages? Listen to laetitia nothing allows us to affirm at this stage that there will be children among the hostages but if this were the case some of them could very well suffer from chronic asthma or diabetes in which case he would require urgent medical attention. The situation would be worrying the parents that we would not imagine very shocked would then be immediately placed in a psychological cell thank you Martin we will meet you later for further guesses. As luck would have it, he's a comic film actor. No but wait. How can you say such a thing Amanda. It's second degree because for you all the actors of comic films necessarily forget their loyalty cards in the red pants hello disgusting cliche. Amandine doesn't caricature your father, he didn't say that. I'm just saying that's it. By dint of fucking laxity put a big facho in fact Amandine we don't leave like that your father don't give a fuck I can no longer live with old people when all that interests you and your little bourgeois. I put on different colored shoelaces to express my rejection of this rotten society serious if it is to end up like you I prefer to tell you right away. What did I say wrong. Fabrice prepares the body in you everything will be fine. Go to jail. I just want my wife and son back. Words. Of. Galway. It promises. Reports present. To the. Party. to slut. I just forgot my loyalty card. I don't pass. And it's my son my balavoine battle. It's perfect. I love it worth it. He's right boss, that's the singer. The more your fight the chorus it is super hard to sing. This is. True. Yes it's super hard we were singing completely windy. It's true that you sing out of tune. The. Way. Of which you know that at home caution is great I have no solution here I'm going to run away I'm going to run Through the forest with a bit of luck I reach the Cantal border before daybreak. Have followed. Yes. It's crazy how long life is from where several small paths start depending on the path you take. You arrive elsewhere than where you would have arrived if you had taken another path. You do not find. Mutually. Take good care of Jean-Pierre. It gave me moderate pleasure to know you. Really. Whether. You slap well and so sure. Chief chief chief I think it is necessary stop counting he's gone that the low. Look. Hello hello. The boys. It'll be OK. Accessed run and get arnica granules from to all. Of them. It makes. That. When you want at sir and madam Yes. You are good at Mr. and Mrs. hello there. We put it where. In the bedroom. How much floor. Facing the window. Of them. One hundred and eighty you are not afraid to lose sight of yourself. When you say that. No nothing. Near from here. Without membership card. Store request. Everyone is spreading. That you doubt it. You're just a human cadet. A human as a limit. In order to. May you be free as skin as yours. Hold on tight. Your brush. Mine. A membership card member. Nowadays nothing. Everybody asks himself. if you are fine are you well Fabrice. The. Humans like the others. Each next to the apostle. Because you know. Humans. Suffer. Suffering every day. Each. Week. Actor studio people. Activate bus. Good evening simple sings. Most. Promoters. Each. Stores. Hello. Caprice. So. I miss you so much. I see you say to Gerard. How I regret all those uno parts I refused to do with him. You will receive that after twelve games I was a little fed up but. Today I tell myself that I should have been more patient. So yes. Maybe we're being too selfish. We need a good lesson. Excuse me sir but you got the wrong number. On the other hand for the uno I am a bit like. Sweetheart. Am like that. Not quite us. Rectify. But neck kisses are more on our side. That. It's perfect. Thanks. Fabienne your details are so precious to me. You're welcome. If it can help you. On the other hand, I would like us to revise Love in the Shower. Not to the point on that. Nope yet I have the impression that we hips are very perfectionist and I don't want to miss anything. It smells on the screen. Thanks. It's not okay. Whether. It's just that you're trying so hard, it's very touching. But. But there's no mass and it's me excuse work. You camp a Fabrice crying out for truth. It's even very disturbing. It's just that it's not quite. My Fabrice. We will get there. We are going to work. It's interesting what you're going to tell me. My Fabrice is killing you. Thanks. So. Thirty-seven. Fifty. Where. Excuse me. Could you please speak a little louder ma'am. Yes. So. That makes you thirty seven Euros and fifty cents. You have the loyalty card. Yes of course and. There I had my wallet. I looked in my wallet. So we weren't looking for it. No sorry I think I forgot it in my other pants. I have learned. TO. To act. Ha ha ha ha. Well we continue. No but I have it I forgot it in my other pants but yes of course. As if by chance. And you have changed puppets. Until today oh yes because it's great. Tandem is not going at all. It's me. Oh yes you. I'm sorry but you play very badly. And play badly. Oh yes. You are. There you can't help her a little bit because it's painful I'm fine here but I'm not his job either think but. We can. Make it simple. Simple. I hear. No but I have it I forgot it in my other pants of course. As if by chance. I was coming. If it happens a ball that is. Stress but you must not look at it, you must forget it, there is no one, it's the two of us. OK. Come on let's try it Go for it. But yes of course but yes of course but yes of course yes of course but of course by chance. As if by chance. But yes of course coincidentally a super. You changed your pants, I'm going to change. I'm going to change pants. just today Just today. Just today. To listen to how I do it. Just today. That's what I did no no no no no. Listen to me carefully. Just today. Just today. Great it's good here we go. We have it. Searched immediately otherwise he will he will lose it. But yes of course. As if by chance. You changed your pants. Just today. But here's congratulations. And so that's when I caught the leek that would have married a story too. Thanks. Approach. Necessarily. Look for. You stop if you want of course. Don't approach because otherwise don't play dumb the support. I have to endure. I don't fool around. See her. Peace. Because good. That's right. Don't be stupid, the soup is enough. OK. Reconstruction then today. They really take us for naïve people. Before. Why do you say that. What day are we here. Thursday. Who says Thursday says. Judas. Who says I tell him. Jewish. Eh. Everything in fact. First witness. And. He waving like this. I have a guy. Maybe it was more serious that I was at six o'clock. I had proposed humiliation. I'm sorry to say but he remembered no words. That's it, it's design. It's not complicated though. Because of individuals like this gentleman that I can no longer dine that my husband is in the country of human rights which radiates throughout the world by its culture. Couldn't we make an exception for artists? Master we are listening to you. I repeat it firmly. It is not possible to balance the two scales of justice. As the sister-in-law of one of the victims said the candles will no longer be blown out on the birthday. Just to remember. What is perpetuity? It is a figment of the mind a concept. At the end of which twenty two years to break everything. The accused here. Killed. He chopped off heads so much. He raped. So this is where I am a poet is in no way comparable. With the sounding and stumbling perpetuity of the families of the victims. Will not be mistaken charming folder. Yes the what. Loyalty for you you tell me nothing I miss you a lot. The accused here present, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. He's a beleaguered man a fugitive the reluctant heroes of social networks. The truth is that he is an actor in need of fame. Please. excuse me gentleman in the back there. me yes you we can know why you don't put a name but that's because I haven't heard the last word but. Can you repeat the last word for sir I didn't hear the last word. In need of fame. Where. So. And you. As the trial draws to a close. What is your view of this affair, what analysis do you do. For my part, I believe from the beginning that this unfortunate story is clear. And directly attributable to an overly lax security policy of a government adrift. And. I join my thumb and my index finger to give weight to my point. You may be joining your thumb and forefinger but I I paste all rights. With both my hands. Listen you don't have a monopoly on all the fingers of the two glued hands look. Please please. Refocus if you want the debate. On the now my chin in a slightly asymmetrical posture. You. Look good you think. Good. Please. I understand your encounters. Hmmm hmm I'll join you. Instead. Benjamins and four fours. Four two three. Two Three by Benjamin Television. So it's seven-thirty that morning. And as the sun begins to illuminate the sky with its rays. My client stands up. Then go wake up her son. Little Gerard eight years. You have trouble waking up. Yes, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Gerard is a bit grumpy. Like often on Thursdays when he knows he has to go swimming. Pool he hates since one of his classmates put his head under water. So when my client still manages to get him out of bed. It's already seven fifty two. The time has therefore ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Already damn shot. Excuse me. What can I tell you about. Intervene well. I. Am sorry you could sue. My client would like to go to court. I. Think. That you agree. We're listening to you. That's the way then when I got used. That morning when I noticed.

I swear I almost put. Today. I have to be frank with you. Is with myself. My lawyer started. To tell you about this tragic morning as if it were. The urgency that had made me commit the irreparable but it is not the urgency. Don't have to. That. The day before I had already taken my son to school. In front of the school we. Meet parents, we socialize, we'll have a coffee and no, we are not talking about children's drawings or shows, we are talking about politics, ecology, football. And yes I plead guilty. I generally have a great time. But no he was not. Particularly dirty these pants not particularly dirty these pants. I work excuse me. I see a spectator like you. Would you like to continue. I told him that these pants weren't particularly dirty, I was just afraid that people would notice that I was wearing already the same the day before. So often then. Put on clean pants was one. Terrible mistake. I admit it. Because on the one hand no one noticed anything at the cafe. Because in a rush I put on yesterday's pants. In the machine. At that time I was unaware that my loyalty card was still in the pocket of those damn pants. And even if I would have noticed it impossible to go back impossible to stop this damn machine. Because in fact when you run the program the door is blocked. So this morning this brown ballet loyalty card. Wash. It would be over a thousand rpm. This loyalty card. Quartered. Series. Shredded. They present my destroyed self-esteem. Bruised vanity. And the loss of the love of my life. I'm done. Too. Accused stand up. At the question. Is the accused guilty of having forgotten his loyalty card in his other pants. The court answered yes. Consequently. The courtyard. convict the accused at. Next to. Get out of the trial. It was very good. Oh yeah I worked suddenly I noted a lot of things, however I think for the scene of the arrest. Yes the one where Fabrice hurts his knee and all the cops fall on us. Knee pain, I can see, no, I don't feel knee pain we have already seen in diminishes film. While neck pain. That's something we've never seen. That I could play and give you amazing things. In any case, if someone has heard something, my client and I are interested. Thanks a lot. Please please. Chief on. What does it do with the kitchen. I would like to know. Protect released. To condemn a what. I wasn't far but frankly I didn't hear anything. Me it seems to me to have heard it is nevertheless not too serious at a time. I'm like I am Dorian. Thierry is the number of the previous you. Perhaps more directly but it's not good but I don't have his number. I have it. I have pistachio and her husband. Great go ahead. What do I say. Wait I do. Answering machine. Yes hello here the officer in charge of the accused whose trial has just ended. It turns out that we have a little doubt about the verdict we don't have. Understood.

No, I don't see it like that, okay, it's twenty centuries of patriarchy, you project your Arcade it's okay calm down it's not going a bit strong patriarchy. The back breaks a little, ma'am wait, she's a modern heroine okay, fabienne, a resistance fighter, ok, doesn't have the same weapons as men, that's it, it's true but in the end it's her who, except Fabrice, agrees it's a Fabienne Lucie-Aubrac a Germaine tillion was scared Germaine tillion anything is Fabrice. Fabrice the pillar of the group is not the engine he is the one who decides all this is the reason thank you. You know the time I spent my immersion with the real Fabienne. All the time and the work all that cost me arms and we calm down. And we resume. It's really over with Benjamin.
