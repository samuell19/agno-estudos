A HANDFUL OF TIME Damned old sod. Either he's snoring or he's pissing. Don't swear, Martin. We're together. Everything's alright. I don't know, Anna. I shouldn't have let you stay on the west coast. But we'll make it good, one way or another. One way or another. Father! The horse is mine! I got it from my father. The claimant says the horse belongs to the farm. He says your father has mortgaged everything, - - and that there's not enough to cover the debt. And that you have no right to claim anything. Just one moment. I was present during the foaling. It took place in fact during a game of poker. I can bear witness that Martin got the horse there and then, - - and that he has owned it and taken care of it since. Well, Martin, there wasn't much left to you, - - but you know, your father went by car all the way. This toast is to Anker hurray and this toast is to Anker hurray and shame on those who won't toast to Anker hurray hurray that toast was great hurray Anker, you must have something with which to make a toast. Waiter. Sk5l and congratulations! Now I thought I'd make a speech for this day. I mean, for my husband. Anken As many of you know, Anker was born motherless. And Anker subsequently ended up with his grandmother, Agnes, - - a kind and god-fearing woman. While his father, our dear Martin, - - went to England to fight for our fatherland. This is a day of joy - - because Anker is fifty years old, - - but it is also a day of sorrow, - - because it's fifty years today since Anker's mother, Anna, died. What's she saying? She's just saying that it's fifty years since mother died. But I talked to her yesterday! One, two, three! - It's my turn now! - No! Coward! You have to! Tor! Stupid brat! I'll tell father! Anna. It's Martin. I thinkl know who he's looking for I think he's going to the west coast to buy horses. I don't think that boy's got eyes for anything but horses. I want to thank life for having given me so much it has given me bam bam bam bam Martin Father. Please don't say that you're talking to mother. - But it's true! - No, it isn't. Why are you carrying on like this? Damned if I'll stand for this! Father. Don't take it like this. You know how people are. - People! What about you? - There we are, Martinsen. No, here we are, Anker and I, in the middle of an important discussion. - Happy birthday. - Thank you very much. Nothing to do but get off to bed. Good night, Martin. I'll pop in tomorrow. To Australia. Sydney. Got his wife there. Unfortunately, can't go back to the old country then, but I have two grandchildren, too. Not again! But Mrs. Kristensen How many times do I have to say that you musn't go shopping alone? Oh God. Now we have bread here for a whole year. Well, first we have to get out of this chair. Martinsen! I have a contention. I would contend that you're having a morning after. How fine you look. Are you going out? I'm to be aired. - How are you today? - Aren't you going to greet me? Hello, Colonel Jaren. Hello, Quarter-master. - Everything ship-shape in the Navy? - Sure. Must be a problem to use a boat every time you have to get a woman? - I brought you a bottle of beer - You're a good son. Anker, I wondered, could you drive me to the west coast in your car? To the west coast? Your father had a question, boy. It doesn't fit in with my job now, but closer to the holidays Closer to the holidays, yes. Quarter-master! One moment. I'd like to I don't want to! No! I don't want to! Let go! No! For God's sake, Martinsen! I'll call for the night nurse! Have you gone mad, Martinsen? Anna had never been out in such cold water before. - Never gone swimming so early. - I guess she hadn't. She has probably forgotten all about it. Yes, I should think so. Now, listen, you old goat. You're not worthy of saying Anna's name. She's ten times better than you - - and all the other silly fools shuffling around in this place. Don't take it so hard, Martinsen. We can have a little fun. I think it's beautiful that you're so faithful to your late wife. Late! You and all the others in this place are like mummies compared to her. Mummies! If it weren't for what happened then, I wouldn't be here. But I'll make it good. Just so that you know it! Then he says: "But I saw her yesterday!" It means he's not quite sure where he is Father! Wait, father! Martin, wake up. 1 have to talk to you. Martin? Martin? No, getting him to wake up is like Anna, are you here? Anna! But I heard you! Anna! Anna? Anna? Anna? Anna? What are you doing here? Martinsen, we can't have this. Get into bed at once! I want to talk to you tomorrow. Martin, how could you do a thing like that? Well, I thought she was you. I should never have left you on the west coast. Shut up, damn it! Oh God, I can't stay here, Anna. People just die here. So it's this guy? Nice weather we've got, too. You'd better come in and get a cup of coffee. You'll probably want to work in the woods, Martin? No I'd like to go to the west coast and buy horses. I intend staying there through the winter - - and buying when the feed begins to run out. And then getting back over the mountains in the spring. Have you got the means to do this? No... I thought I'd ask you to lend me some money. Here you have two thousand crowns. I want it back. And a foal as interest. Here's 500 crowns I owed your father from the last poker game. You might get a horse with that lot. - What are you doing here? - Your mother wants you to drop by. You're lying! Go home, father! - We could have some fun here. - Can't you leave me alone, father? My girlie I'm coming back tonight, you brat! Martin? May I come with you? I have to I have to get away from here. Martin! Arnfinn lent you some money, didn't he? You'll have to do something in return. The girl must get away. You can come back with her whenever you can. Anna, go fetch your things. And, Martin, please be kind to her. Remember, girls are human beings, too. I'll have to consider her as interest. The shiniest coffeepot I've ever seen. I bought it last week. I thought we might have use for it. So, you had decided to come along? Before I knew anything at all? Martin. Martin. Come here. Listen. Anna. Come here! Martin! Martin, help me! No! - Get away from me! - Take it easy, Martin. It's only me. I guess I fell asleep. Back to the old familiar places? I'm only making a little trip on a bike. Come on home and have a cup of coffee. Anker called. He thought you might be around. I'll call him, so he doesn't have to worry. Riding all the way on a bike? Must be several miles. Not many people your age would dare to make a trip like that. How old are you now? Seventy? Damn It's a long way over the mountains. And anything could happen. That's true, Anna. Anything could happen. I've killed my father. I killed him. And now he's coming to get me. He's gone now. Don't be afraid, Anna. He won't come back. Anna.? Anna! What has he done to you? He was so cruel to mother and me. Once when I was a little girl and had peed on the floor I was naked He lifted me up and placed me on the hot stove. Martin Anna.? Anna! It was only the horse! - Shall we go swimming? - No! It's too cold! No, I don't want to! No! Let me go! Yeah! This would happen. I'm ruined for life. - I've broken everything. - Nonsense, Martin. Let me see. - No, it hurts. Be careful. - I am careful. It looks like everything's alright. Martin! Martin! Martin! No! Anna! Anna! Anna, help me! I'm your father! You got to help me! Anna! I'm coming, Anna. I'll watch over you. I'm afraid you're ill, my boy, and we haven't much time. You promised me to go across to the west coast. I don't thinkl can make it I'm so tired. I think I'm going to die. What nonsense. You're not allowed to. You can't give in now. No, you have to contact people. It belonged to my father. I should really have given you a ring, but The water has ruined the clockwork, but it's gold. Thank you. Now we're married, Anna. That's good, Martin because I think I'm going to have a baby. You're You're with child? We'll have to take it down to the village. The owner will want it. Hey! Could you send down the hay? Great! Come on now and get some food! She's having a kid. The eagle doesn't take kids. - It's my bell. - We found it up there. The sheep was torn to pieces. Do you hear, Kari? It's the eagle. - The eagle doesn't take kids! - Be quiet, Henrik. I'll go up into the mountains tomorrow. Use the sheep as bait. Damn it. We can't have eagles here when the baby is born. Welcome in. I just had a talk with the doctor It's very serious. What does your wife say? Not very much. She went to Denmark yesterday. For an indefinite period. - Did you have a dream, Anna? - I dreamt that you needed me. I think I need you forever, Anna. Baa. A lot of fine young horses down at the village. Fine horses. And you can get feed from me. We don't have many animals. Henrik is a little He just became like that. - Henrik is our half brother. - Our? But aren't you Yes, but it's a bit complicated. Henrik is the son of Daniel's mother and my father. - I'm my stepfather's brother-in-law. - My stepmother is my sister-in-law. Now both are dead. We inherited the farm. And Henrik. She isn't dead. She isn't dead. That's Maren. Our little girl. - Taken by the eagle. - The eagle doesn't take kids! Would you like to stay here, during the winter? That's no problem. We have plenty of room. It won't be expensive. - Well - Great. Then it's a deal. It'll be nice hearing voices now and then. Besides, you could help me a little. Wait! Hold it! I just have to When I get eager, I always have to pee. Come on! It's quiet here. Don't you ever feel lonely? I've never been any other places. I don't know about anything else. My mother couldn't stand it, so she left and didn't come back. For ten years it was only my father and me staying here. Then Sunniva came and Daniel. Daniel's going to make electricity by means of the wind. Have a look. Two fine horses, Anna. What are you staring at? Get lost! Draw the curtains when you're taking a bath. And the horses were doing alright? Kari says the kid's starting to stir when it's four months. Do you want to feel it? - But, Anna - I'm here too! You don't even look at me! If you want to, we can go to the priest tomorrow. The priest, you say. The priest. You wanted to talk to me, Martin Martinsen? I want to marry Anna again. You'd have to get well first, then. We'll work it out, parson. Come on! Kari, is it coming now? Martin and Daniel won't be home until tonight! This we'll have to manage alone. Can't you keep back, so we might get some help? When it's started, there's nothing to do about it, Anna. Help me get into bed. No! Henrik! Listen to me. I've never done this before. I don't know what to do! You got to help me! Do you understand? Don't cry, Anker. He's not going to die. He's stronger than you think. Don't cry, Anker. Forgive me. Oh God, Kari, it's blood coming out! Don't mind the blood, Anna. That's the way it should be. It's coming, Kari! Push. I can see the head! Push! Push! I can't make it! I can't get it out! I can't bear losing yet another child! - Help me, Anna! Help me. - But how? - Henrik! - Now! It's a fine kid, Kari! Look, what a beautiful boy! This is the third time, Daniel. Aren't you giving in soon? The Bible says all good things are three. This time I know it's perfect! Tonight there'll be wind! Wind! Then your disbelief will be sealed by shame, my friend. What are you saying? Then your disbelief will be sealed by shame, my friend. Henrik, would you give me the talc, please? Henrik! Please! Henrik! What's the matter with him? What are you doing? What has Henrik done to you? This past month he's gone from worse to worse. Do you know what I think? I think he's jealous of you. He was so clever during the birth. It's funny, but I can't remember anything from the birth. It's time! All ready for progress. Come on out. All ready for a little demonstration for the disbelievers. Yes, the windmills! Come on! NOW! Here you see the man who's taking his own road. Here you see the man who draws energy from the air. "Here you see the man who draws energy from the air!" You'll have to wait in excitement a little longer. Just a connection. That's it. Just a minute. - What is Henrik doing with the kid? - Henrik! Henrik! Henrik! Henrik. Henrik! You'll get a thrashing. I'll beat the shit out of you! - Don't scare him. - Will he do it? Henrik! Henrik! You, my best helper and friend, come down and give me the kid. It's not the little girl. He's lost his last bit of sound mind. No, it's not the little girl, - - but Daniel and Kari are so fond of that boy. Come on down, Henrik. That's fine, Henrik. Come on down and give me the kid. That's it, Henrik. Come here! What are you doing, Henrik? If you do something like this another time, I'll trash you! You can't sit here, you know? Why did you do this, Henrik? It's not the little girl. I was just going to swap them. Because she isn't dead. It just It wasn't my fault! What happened to the little girl? The eagle doesn't take kids. We were playing I was good at carrying her We played with the wire ...and so... She was strong I lifted her She was hanging on the wire She liked it! She laughed! And then she was gone. The eagle doesn't take kids! Oh my God. Martin! Oh, Martin! I want to go home! I want to get away from here! Come in. You must be strong to recover from pneumonia from one day to the other The doctor says you'll leave a week from now. A week? Fine, because I have something to do on the west coast. West coast? How on earth would you get there? On foot? No, father, you come home and get well. Verdi was forty-years old when he wrote "La Traviata". Just my age. Same story as in "Camille", that film with Greta Garbo. About two young lovers who come together in the end, - - but then she's dying, all through the last reel, of consumption. Lots of people died of consumption. Her lover, his name is Alfredo, he comes to her deathbed. He sits there and she says: "I love Alfredo, - - and God has cleansed my soul in repentance." That's beautiful. You can stop now. Sure you don't want to call home? Hallo? Yes, it's me. What? When? I see. No, that's alright. Thank you for calling. Would you believe it? That stubborn devil has left the hospital. Oh God, he's far from well. He'll make it. Strong as a mountain. I know where he's going. Martin? Martin? Don't you hear me? You have to go on. You're right. I hope it's not too late. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm out hiking. Is it possible to buy some coffee and bread? You can get bread, but I have no coffee. Wait a little, and you'll get some meat. I'm about to slaughter. Slaughter? What, at this time of year? The hotel wants a lamb to roast and serve to the council. Help me a little, and you'll get a free meal. Thanks for everything, and now you're going the same way. I'll teach you not to stay out all night! No! No! Now you have to be careful, Martin. Someone will be blamed for the death of that animal. Blood is thicker than water. They'll tell on you. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it, Anna. What nonsense. You're so clever at working things out! We'll handle everything, Martin. Everything. Anna! Anna! Anna! - Why should he come here? - Anna. This is where she is. Poor Martin. It's so cold outside now. Well, Anna, here I am. You heard what the Englishman said. It's still not too late. It wasn't right, what happened. I'll have to make it good. Because it was my fault. Your fault, and my fault. But get up here, so we can work it out. Dearest Martin. I'm coming, Anna. Everything will be alright. I'm worried about the mare. She's about to foal. It's bad for her, being out in this kind of weather. I'm going to check on the horses. Coffee will do us good. Martin! Come and listen! The music's back. Strange. I got scared. It plays every time something's going to happen. Everything scares you. Let's eat and sleep. Tomorrow we go down into the valley. Damn it! The mare! I hope she doesn't get hurt! Martin! Wait! Steady now, steady, steady. Steady, steady. That's it. Come on now. Anna! Anna! Come out and see what we've got! Anna? Anna! Anna! No! Anna! Anna! No, it can't be true! Anna! Anna! No! No! Anna! Are you here, Anna? Martin! Come back! IN MEMORY OF OUR FRIEND ANDERS ENGER Subtitles: Scandinavian Text Service 2009
