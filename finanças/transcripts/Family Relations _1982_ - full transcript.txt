MOSFILM Nonna MORDYUKOVA Svetlana KRYUCHKOVA Andrei PETROV Ivan BORTNIK Yuri BOGATYRYOV Fedya STUKOV in KINFOLK Why are you yelling, Maria? Shut up! Go on with your painting! The rest is none of your business! No one can ever leave this place! Some procedures you got here! It's enough to make you scream, you know! People are supposed to sit here all night waiting for tickets! Is it war or what? No coming, no going. And no one to complain to. No one to tell about it. Such huge trains are running and they can't take just one person on. What kind of business is that? Parasites! - Hey, man, what's that you got? - A ticket. - For the next train? - Right, it's coming. - She said no tickets. - This is WL. It's expensive. How expensive? Well, it's not that expensive, but it's good because... Oh shit! Make way, women! Can you hear me? Aunt Katya, take a broom and come to the buffet. Folks, who ties animals to the ticket office? Someone tied a dog, now it's a steer. It's no way. Untie him, please. Hello. Good day. - Hi. - It's occupied. Oh God... - I'll be right back. - All right. Yes? - What's your name if it's no secret? - Tanya. Tanya dear, some tea, please. I guess your tea isn't strong enough, so don't bother, I'll make it myself. I've got such little bomb... Just bring me some boiling water. - So it's you? - Yes, me. It means... - With me? - I guess so. - You alone? - Alone. All right... How about you... None of your business. Miss! - Go away mister! - I apologized, didn't I! Miss! I'm not going like this. - What's up? - Don't you have women's beds? You put me up with some... Don't you see... How come? - Is he making passes? - What do you mean, passes? I can't change, can't put my slippers on. Go back to your compartment now, we'll find something for you. Okay? It's a long way to your station, the whole night, we'll think of something. Wait! What are you doing?! Turn it on now! Turn on the light! Hooligans! Oh... Where's that man? - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. It's a tunnel. I know. Why did you get scared? - Come in. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. My name is Yuri Nikolayevich Lyapin. Do you mind? This is Georgian dry wine. My friend sent it from Georgia. - Nah, I don't drink colored wine. - Well, I don't drink much either. I even quit smoking. But sometimes it helps, it calms you. Really? Then pour me some. For you too? That'll do. - To our meeting. - To our meeting. Oh, what a poison! Some friend you've got! No, actually he's a good man. Actually, he's not Georgian, he's Greek, though he lives in Tbilisi, he is a tennis coach. Excuse me, what's your name? - What? - Your name. Oh. Maria. And I'm Yuri. Incidentally! I didn't drink that much, but it went to my head. Let's have something to eat. I was hanging about the station all day! Very well. You take charge here, I'll go and procure some plates and forks. Tanya! Can you find some plates and forks for us? There you go. Thanks a lot. Good girl! My dear, why do you keep coming and going? You know, I couldn't understand how it could... how it could be that the door's locked but the man's gone! You know, I thought I was going to die. Let's have another shot. Though I can't drink much. You know, when I drink, I get... I get kind of bad in the head. Start singing right away. The matchmakers came to me On a skewbald mare! Carried away all my stuff, For the bride didn't care! What's up? Did you wind it up? No. Guys from our fish factory gave it to me. As a joke, they wrote on it: Don't oversleep the fishing season. It works alright, but rings whenever it likes. Excuse me. Are we almost there? - Maria, may I call you? - All right. - Shall I give you a lift? I got a car. - No. Come on! Come on! Fast train number 71 "Bogachyovo ? Suvorsk" is arriving at track one. The train stops for 5 minutes. Cars numbered from the tail. - Oh, daughter! - Mama dear! Oh, my God! Careful, mama! Hi! Welcome! - When are the exercises? - Tomorrow. I was traveling in style! Do you wear glasses now? - So I'll call you? - All right. - Is Stanislav at his work? - Yes. Too bad you didn't bring Irishka. I've missed her so much! Your glasses gave me a fright. Thought something's wrong with your eyes. No, I'm all right. To hell with them, take them off! Here, Shurka sent you a note. She had a baby at last! A swell boy! Could hardly deliver him. It's about dress patterns. And she wants a necklace for the New Year. - Here, have an apple. - I don't want it, mama. - What about you, young man? - Merci. What's the matter with you? Oh, what are you doing, mama? Why did you have to smear it all? I smeared it all! Goodbye! The general, we rode together. Handsome man! Came to inspect exercises. And in my compartment was the chief engineer of a fishing factory! About my age. I nicknamed him "a man with a mustache". He got a mustache like a cube! It's just a riot! And what's that, Nina? Do you smoke?! - Drop it now! - Come on, mama! - Give it to me! - Stop it, mama! I know what I'm doing! Here, you may have it! Did I give birth to you for you to smoke that filth? Will you shut up, please? - Nina, hurry, the telephone! - What do you care? - Maybe it's for me? - Who can call you? Perhaps there's someone. Stop it, you've just arrived. Hello? - Do you have a rag? - I'll do it later, mom. I'm listening. Are you going to play the silent game? Well, as you wish. He wouldn't answer? No, he wouldn't answer. Nina, I see Stasik is still into his snags, making sculptures. Good for him. - Remember Kolia, the Pioneer leader? - Yes, I do. I just finished packing, was about to go to the station, and here he comes carrying all kinds of roots and knolls and some weird stumps. Here, Aunt Marusya, take them to your son-in-law. How could I? With all the stuff I was bringing. Nina, will Tasik bring Irishka from the kindergarten? I must tell you something, only don't get scared, please. - What? - Stasik and I are separated. - Divorced? - Not yet, but it's going to happen. - Oh, Nina! - Mama, I beg you! Oh, my God! Mama, please. I'm begging you, mama. I wouldn't have told you if I knew you'd be bewailing. How can you, you got a daughter! I've just informed you, that's all. I wish I'd never come here! I'm going away from here. Nina! Nina! - What is it, mom? - They're there with those snags! And look, up there! Your man! A real hero! Oh, mama! It's for me. - Why for you? - I swear. Listening. Playing again? No brains mean a cripple. Call when you get tired of it. Shit! May your hands wither away! Oh, I'm sorry. Nina's out, I... it's her mother. Right, Maria Vasilyevna. See how it turned out! And who are you? Ghena? From her work? I'll tell her, I will. All right. Mom! What is it, for God's sake? Oh, my little fish! My honey! I've missed you so much! You've grown so big! You know what I brought you? There's a basket under your pillow... Grandma, why have you got such a big nose? Why big? A regular nose. I'm big and my nose is big. It's interesting... The interesting, grandma, is around the corner to your left. How did you like your granddaughter? She's grown up! They grow so fast. - Mom, get away. - I'll show you 'get away'! Don't yell, I beg you! Anyone called me? Oh, daughter, the veggie caviar worked out real good, with a soul to it! - I asked you: Did anyone call? - I can't hear you for all that music! Ira, I beg you, turn that stupid music off! Stop it now! Go to your room! I'm sick and tired of all this! All right! What's the matter? My little baby... Nina, why is she like that? Like what? A normal city child. They're all like that in kindergarten. They got a load of things to do. I asked you: Did anyone call me? - Well, did they? - I had no time to tell. Someone did. What's wrong? Have you lost something? Have you? - Someone called? - Yes. It was embarrassing. I took it up, they say nothing. I yelled, then someone says politely: This is Ghena. And then he asks, you know: Is that her mother? I say yes. And who's that Ghena? Why does it smell of wine here? What wine? We had a drink with Mashka. Today is her birthday. We went to a cafe with the girls. One bottle of champagne for the 5 of us. You do remember Mashka, don't you? We came with her last year, remember? A little blond one. - What have you got on your head? - Grandma's present. Take it off. Grandma's present is for winter. Go to your room. Get away from the jam with your spoon! Go to your room! Lay off me! Oh, what great caviar I cooked! Taste it, daughter. I don't want it now. - Taste it now, I said! - Come on, mama... Why does Irishka say that I got a big nose? Is it really big? That's how they joke now. I wish you heard what she says to me. And who is that Ghena? Ghena is my colleague. We work together. I sit here, and he over here. The man just called once and you already ask: "Who's that Ghena?" Who, who, a horse from the zoo. Ghena... Ghena... Crocodile Ghena. Ever seen Cheburashka? Nina, have you seen father? What father? Our father. He must be here... Living in the city. I saw your beau when grandmother died. Why? It's just... interesting. We had once lived together. Oh, Irishka! You know he played the accordion so beautifully when he was young. The moment he stretched out his accordion, all women went crazy! I hid his accordion once, he cried so hard. They say he got a family now, two kids, a job. Everything will be all right with you. And Irishka will be all right, and I will be all right. Scoring a goal against the team of "Burevestnik" was Anatoly Pashvykin, number 7! Nina, those have scored! Have you seen it, granddaughter? Lullaby, lullaby, Go to sleep, don't cry. Help me please, Mother of God, To wash everything I got. Irishka, did your mom and dad fight? Perhaps he began to hit the bottle? It's all right if you don't want to tell. Oh, my God... Nina, is that you? - Hi. - Oh, howdy! - Good to see you. - Thank you. I just dropped by to... Why not? You're still the master of the house. We have no masters here anymore, we had done away with masters back in 1917, so... - Look, you goat. - I beg your pardon? I mean, have you no conscience? Conscience? No conscience. That's why you walk and whistle, lost your cap and don't give a thistle. You know, I've never understood those metaphors of yours. So you, the bandit, don't give a damn about your daughter, right? This is too serious a subject. We'd better leave it for later. For now, let me take some things that are precious to me. So you've come for precious things! Not in the sense you mean. Precious in the spiritual sense of the word. - You'll do without. - What do you mean? Come when Nina's here. You mean when the she-goat's here? Please don't misunderstand me, but if, as you put it, I'm a goat, then, naturally, my wife is a she-goat. Oh boy! Oh, God! Tasik! - What is it? - Maria Vasilyevna, you're wrong! - Roll out of here! - Naturally. I have no other choice, but you're wrong. Why did you fall, Tasik? Now let's be serious. Please tell Nina that from now on I'll never set my foot in this house! - We'll survive. - Naturally. But time will tell who's right and, as we know, time is for us! - Step aside, please. - What? - Step aside, please! - You're welcome. Who needs you? Well, that's it... Oh, damn it! Shame on you, Maria Vasilyevna, a simple Russian woman. I think your daughter... Don't come near me! I'm standing. She won't forgive you that, neither will my daughter. - Look... - Don't touch me! Ciao-miaow! Let me through! Hello? No, I didn't chase anyone. Just turned my son-in-law out. How? Knocked him on the head. And who's speaking? Ah, Yuri Nikolayevich! Meet you? All right! Hey, man with a mustache! Maria Vasilyevna, how are you? I've been watching you for a long time, by the way. It's hard to recognize you. Good for you! Hi. And what's this round thing? This round thing. - You bought a cake? - No, it's a hat. Right, it's time. Soon the last ones will fall down. - Are we waiting for someone? - No, nobody. And the flowers? For you. What? No way! God forbid! Take them away! I'm not some young girl! What's so bad about it? It's interesting. The interesting is around the corner to the left, as my granddaughter says. Come on, Maria Vasilyevna! Look, what's going on? It's ridiculous! - I'll never take it! - What's so bad about it? I won't even hear about it! It's embarrassing, don't you understand? - Why embarrassing? - There're people looking... - Is this hat for me? - Yes, for you. What a mess I've got in! Maria Vasilyevna! - Comrade General! - Comrade General! Comrade General! - Let's have our picture taken. - All right. Here's a photo machine. Insert 20 kopecks... I can't understand anything. I've been waiting all preened up since 5. Call him. Can you do it for me? I did it for you last time. Thanks for nothing. Bye. Some friend... Damn hypocrite. When she needs anything, you must do it even if it's nighttime. Hello? May I speak to Gennady Borisovich? Ghena, are you playing games with me? It's almost 7. Hello? What? Ghena, I know it's you. Left for where? Ghena, where did you leave for? Yes, I got it. I got it that you are not you. Ira, please, turn the TV down. I wanted to tell you something. No, hear me out! Listen to me, for God's sake! It's no way to behave! Hello? Some goose... What now? Coming, coming! Why keep ringing? - Oh, you're home! - Can't you see? - Why are you so naked? - I'm going to bed. - What? - Never mind. Had your fun, bride? Am I supposed to sit on a chair and wait till I die? Give me my gray skirt. Ira, this program should not be watched, especially by children. I'm going to throw the TV set away! Go to your room and clean up! All right! - Did Stasik come? - He did. - Why did you hit him? - Whom? Stasik. Did I ask you to? No need to ask me, I can see everything myself. What can you see? What can you know about our affairs? Oh, what can we know about your affairs! You got your life, we got ours. Don't you introduce your ways here and don't let loose with your fists! - What if he hit you back? - Who? That one? What do you mean, "that one"? He's my husband and the father of my child! How come that father of your child doesn't live at home? That's our personal affair, it's none of your business! All day I thrash out like a fish on the ice. I know. I called. The music was on, the cobra was home, a happy family life. Bye. All day like a fish on the ice. Ira, stop that outrage! Where're you now? I struggle for everything to be like it's supposed to be, to have something to wear, to put on the table, to hang in the closet! Really! I'm going out of my way! I see how you got out of your way! An American doll! If we wash you, you know yourself what we'll get! - What do you know about it? - I know why you're all made-up! And you want me to scare everybody off, like you, and be left alone? It's only you who can live alone! You've never needed anyone! - It's not true! - Yes, it's true! It's true! Father did the right thing when he ran away from you! Turn that music off now! Because you always want to have your way! Where's that pest? Only your way and no one else's! - Who told you that father ran away? - Who? A horse in the Zoo! Stop it! Let me for once talk to Grandma quietly! You're like a tank, mama. You're a tank! You can only crush, destroy and break. You poke in where you're not invited! You should keep mum, but you butt in. - I always tell the truth! - Who needs your truth? - One already ran away from your truth. - He didn't, I drove him out myself. I loved him more than life, but I drove him out! What do you think! To live with such a jerk? He used to hang out all night, the veteran pilot, then he shows up! The tractor got stuck in the swamp, they had to haul it out! And himself is reeking of women's perfume! And then he would shed a tear: My darling guiding star! He starts to play his accordion, the women walk and sigh: "Vovchik!" And Vovchik just puts on airs! But when he began to drink, I couldn't bear it anymore! And you had to bear, mama! - And lie? - Yes, and lie! What are you saying? That it's better to lie? Yes, it's better, believe me! Who needs your truth? Why? What is the truth? That I'm 30 but I look like I'm 35? That I enrolled in a college, just to run away from the village? That I hate my work, that I don't love my husband? That's the truth! What do I need it for? And what good had your truth done you? What did you get? Nothing. You're alone, free, proud, independent, single. Don't you understand that a single woman is something improper? Yes, of course! Not to lie, not to jitter, not to throw yourself upon the first man you meet ? it's improper! And to have Ghena when you have a husband, is it proper? - What Ghena? - Crocodile. Ever seen "Cheburashka"? Why crocodile? Don't worry, the crocodile went back to his wife. Oh, so Ghena blew it! And now, help, good people! Give my Stasik back! What... what are you... what are you talking about?! I know what I'm talking about. - What do you know about it?! - I know everything! I just want my child to have a father, to grow up in a normal, healthy atmosphere. I don't want her to share my fate! You thought you could do everything with your fists? With a punch-up? Ira, when is all this going to end at last?! When will all this end?! I'm begging you as a human being! Don't you see what's going on with me?! Attention, passengers! Fast train number 29 "Balta ? Sinelnikovo", that was to arrive yesterday at 22:45, will arrive tomorrow at 7:35. I repeat: Fast train number 29 "Balta-Sinelnikovo", that was to arrive yesterday at 22:45, will arrive at 7:45... What kind of a person are you? I called your daughter: You left, no one knows where. I rushed to one station, then to another ? you're not there. Alone at night at the station! Anything might happen! They said at the hotel, no vacancies. They say it to everybody. No big deal, you should have... Maria, stay put, don't vanish, all right? All right, I'll try to. Good. Here, eat a pear meanwhile. I washed it. I'll be right back. - Let's go. - Why are you scaring me? We'll take a taxi and go to the hotel. Something wrong. - Rimma Vasilyevna. - Coming. Your pass! Hello. You see, there's such situation. A woman... No vacancies. I understand, but it's only for one night. There're no vacancies and won't be any. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Your pass! For six months I brought her flowers each morning. Guys from our art studio... I was good at drawing, I had a gift, but that's not important. I asked the guys and we dug up her mother's kitchen garden in one night. Yes. But she wouldn't agree either. She wouldn't agree to marry me. One night we were walking after watching a movie. And we had a high bridge there, about 20 meters high, even more. There was a stream there, and a dam. But that's not important. I climbed up the parapet and said: "Either you marry me or goodbye." - Did you jump? - No. - You got scared? - She agreed. Would you have jumped if she hadn't? Sure, because I loved her. The day was already fixed for our wedding. That day I woke up early and decided to go and say goodbye to my friends. My fishermen friends were going to the sea that day. I came to them and they ask: "Why aren't you working?" I say it's my first day on leave. Well, we were sitting there... I didn't tell anybody about the wedding out of superstition. So we're sitting in the crew's quarters, the boat's rocking a bit, chitchat, word leads to another. The time ticks past, and I keep looking at my watch. An hour passed, then another, and still another. Only 40 minutes left. Just enough to return home, change and go to the registry office. I say: "I got to go, guys." They laugh: "Go where?" I say: "I got to." The say: Come on, go," and continue to laugh. Then it was like in that song. I came out on deck and my heart stopped beating. We had been in the open sea for 2 hours already. No shore was in sight. Oh, my God! What was next? Next... for 3 fishing seasons I worked on the boat, then technical school. That's how I got into the fishing business, giving up painting. Good for you, or we would have now an artist named Lyapin, some damned abstractionist! Though for a man to be single nowadays is improper. Why? You've been single for many years, and you're all right. A single woman is an improper thing, too. It's improper. You'd better go and sleep. You've got a room and a bed. Sit and be quiet. I don't want to hear anything about it anymore. Your pass! - Why do you carry everything with you? - I always carry everything with me. When I'm on a business trip, I always dream a terrible dream. Like I come from the Ministry to my hotel and find out I've been evicted, with my room full of foreigners and my briefcase gone, with all the documents and reports. Miss, I need to find a person's address. Vladimir Ivanovich Konovalov, born in 1925. Pavlik, come home, child! Hurry up! You got to change! Come on, quick! Who are you looking for? Konovalov, Vladimir Ivanovich. Do you know where he is? Was here in the morning. Perhaps he's shopping. You can wait for him. Hello, Vovchik. Oh, my goodness... Oh, my God! Marusya... Oh, my goodness... Did you come specially to see me? No, to visit with my daughter, Nina. I dropped by to see how you were doing. I'm doing fine, Marusya. I'm sick all the time. I'm always... I've been on a sick leave for two weeks now. Oh, my God... I've got bronchitis, it's absolutely chronic, this thing, you know, what's the name... lumbago. What? Lumbago, something like radiculitis, but more dangerous. And how are you? You're not sickly? Of course, you got the fresh air all the time, it can't make you sick. Are you still living in Baturino, right? Oh, my God, of course. Take a seat, Marusya, I'm sorry. So you've been at Nina's. Be honest, is she all right? She isn't sick, is she? - No, she isn't. - And I am, Marusya... I'm sick. Just had an x-ray taken. I'm sick all through, Marusya! There... you hear? Wheezing! - Are you living alone? - Alone. Who else... Oh, my God... Wait, Marusya, I'll take my cough mixture and be back. Oh God, where did she come from? Slava, tie her up. Marusya, I've put the kettle on. Have something sweet meantime. Maybe you want an apple? Vovchik! Here. Well, tell me, so you still live there? - Yes, there. - Right... You work? - Sure I do. - Right. Got a husband? - Yes. - Who is he? Someone you don't know. Chief engineer. Oh, my God... - Chief engineer where? - A fishing factory. Fishing factory, that's good. Congratulations, Marusya. Well, I too have absolutely made it in life. An important financial position, a very good salary. I bought a carpet, signed up for a motorcycle, Marusya. Soon going to the Crimea for treatments in a sanatorium. So you live alone, no family? I've got two sons, Marusya! Golden boys! Knock on wood, they're healthy, never get sick. In short, their life has turned out well, we must count our blessings. One already served in the army, got married, the other's going to serve. You live alone here? There you go again! Yes, alone! I got an important job, I need quiet night and day! I have a house of plenty, Marusya! I've got everything ? citations, costly presents... Wait, Marusya. Here, Marusya. A watercolor! Inna, phone for you! It's Prague! Inna, come to the phone! It's Prague! - Inna Nikolayevna, it's from abroad! - Coming! Coming! Inna, hurry up! It's Prague! Hello? Hello? Prague? Prague! Hello, Joseph! Good afternoon! See, Marusya? So much work has accumulated. I have no time to work. I'm sick all the time. You know I've been on a sick leave for 2 weeks now. How about you? You don't get sick? Of course you don't, you're in the fresh air all day there. And I get sick all the time. I can't even go out to buy bread. I have to ask my neighbor to do it. Varelik! Wait, Varelik! - How are you, Varelik! - Ah, Konovalov! Hello, Izoldochka! Nothing personal, but you look like Fantomas in these clothes. Have already treated your hangover? Varelik, it's embarrassing, I'm with a woman. I owe you a ruble! Wait! Wait, Varelik! Marusya, give me a ruble, quick! Wait! Marusya, come on, give me a ruble or Varelik will be gone! Thank you, Marusya! Varelik! Keep it. - Thank you for your kindness! - You're welcome. Thank you very much! Wait, my beauty, wait, please don't go yet! Marusya, my dear, you're my million! Wait a minute! Wait, my beauty, wait, please don't go yet, Let my eyes enjoy this so wondrous fete! Konovalov, stop yelling! I got a call from abroad! I pity you, Volodya. I really do. Oh, my God... No need to pity me, Marusya. You'd better, Marusya... pity your chief engineer of a fishing factory. Do you get me? I guess you eat only fish all week in your family? And we, Marusya, have got gas in our apartment. - What nonsense are you talking? - Oh, God! The wife of a fish engineer! Isn't it great! That's not what matters, my dear Marusya! I used to be a chief and a senior, too. And now I'm just a regular bookkeeper at a local municipal office. And I'm happy because I'm not dependent on anyone anymore! I can pull my hat over my ears if I wish, or take it off to someone, to someone who pulls strings. You get it, Marusya? In 3 years, I shall retire and come to your village on a bike. You won't even recognize me. Why haven't you come earlier? I couldn't come earlier, Marusya. With whom would I have left my sick mother then? So many years have passed since we buried her. You know, Marusya, she did... love you. I loved Aunt Dasha, too. And I loved you, Vovchik. You know, Marusya... A wife can find another man, Marusya. But a mother will never find another son. - Please don't cry. - I can't help it, Marusya. You don't know what you've got till you lose it. There's no point in crying now. Why don't you come to the village? It's your village, you could rest there. What village, Marusya? Think what you're talking about! I have to do my work. I must go to the Ministry, and you say, to the village! Village! Here's my village, here's my home! Wait a minute, Marusya, I'll be right back. Varelik! Varelik! Moscow time is 13 hours 7 minutes. Careful! Only not this one. Not him! Where are you going? Come back! - Just wait, I'll catch you anyway! - You don't want to get a haircut? - Does Lyuba Konovalova live here? - Yes, here. - Where? - Her room is over there. Why? - Where's she? - She's not home. Come here. - What's your name? - Kirill. - Having a party? - About to. - And who are you? - A horse in the Zoo. - We're waiting for you! - Close the door. Come on, close it! Just look at you, all shaggy, Kirill Vladimirovich. Have a seat. What a cheeky lot! When did you last see your father? That's what it's all about... And who are you? A relation. What are you doing to the man? Just look how you live. And what about him? He's sick all through, he drinks some poison. After all he's your father and her husband. How can earth carry such people, with no heart at all! You don't care a damn about each other. Sure! A man is alive, all right. He dies, it's even better. All you care about here is music, hair, taxi, ciao-miaow, and that's it! And that your father doesn't even have a bus fare to get to his work, that he's perishing ? it's none of your business! - We're waiting! - Go away. Am I not right? Why don't you say something? What's the matter with you? Oh, God... - Listen, Kirill. - What? Yes, I know it's hard to live with a drinking man. You know, I went to see him today. I felt so sorry for him that I wanted to cry. And at my home, too. My daughter's husband left her, and they have a little daughter. I wanted to help and... I knocked him on the head with my fist. I only made it worse. Now I have to find him and apologize. Are you having some kind of holiday? No. Tomorrow I'm going in the army. But who are you, really? Maria Konovalova, the village of Baturino, Krasina Street, 6. Tasik! Tasik! Wait, we need to talk! I'm begging you, leave me alone, please. And stop calling me that stupid name! My name is Stanislav. I was wrong! I was really wrong! We've already discussed everything and dotted all the I's. - Wait, I said! - Leave me alone, please! - Can you tell him to listen, girl? - Leave the girl alone too! It really turned out bad! We had a fight with Nina because of that. That's your problems. Hello, mister. What do you have here, a restaurant? And then two coffees, please, black, of course. We don't carry any others. Why did you sit down here? Go away. Good afternoon. Hello. Stanislav Pavlovich, we'd better leave. Are you pursuing me? Stasik, why do you say that? I'm no stranger to you. You want trouble? You'll get it. Waiter! - Waiter! - Listen... - Perch fish "Orly"... - Waiter! Waiter! Good day. What would you like? Waiter, this woman... We came here to have a good time, and this woman... she is crazy. I ask you, please, take her away. Yeah, I'm nuts. Stasik, what do you need it for? Please, I'm asking you. Perhaps we'd move to that table? You'll be very comfortable there. Oh, my God, where did you come from, such a handsome man? I live not far from here. - Go and do yourjob. - This is my job. I want to sit with Tasik. But he doesn't seem to want it. He's kind of with a lady already. Oh, God! - Let's move over there. - Let's go, dear. - All right. What will you have? - Something cold to drink. - Why did you take the tray? - Sorry, Kolia. Pavlik, one roast beef, two entrecotes, two glaces, one coffee! Again? - Edik, what did you want? - I need your advice. I sent my son to a music school, need to buy a violin, but which one? Take a Stradivarius, it's a good one. Let me write it down. Thanks. - Pavel Timofeyevich! - I know, I know. The soup has boiled away. Tasik, listen to me. Let's go home. We got borsht, jellied meat, dumplings with cherries, home-made wine. Why eat, like a convict, their rations here? You're a grownup man, you got a bald spot already! Oh, my God! - I don't drink anything colored. - It's our specialty, a "Hamlet" drink. Hi! Oh, Uncle Sasha! So good that you've come! Tasik, do you want me to apologize in front of everybody? Do you, Tasik? Comrades, your attention please! Listen! I'm an old fool! And this is my son-in-law, Tasik! I hit him, and now I promise that I'll never do it again! Never! Tasik, let's go home! Thank you for your attention. Are you happy now? Are you, Tasik? Let's go, Lara. Take your first course with you. Tasik! I'm not Tasik to you! I'm Stanislav Pavlovich! Eat, Lara. Let's go dance, Stanislav Pavlovich. Please, go away from our table. - Come on, let's dance. - Oh, God... You eat, girl. Stanislav Pavlovich, I'm scared. Please, go with her. Hey, young people, let a visiting person dance! Make room, girls! You're right, Ra... La-ra... Come on! Hey, easy, easy! - No way! - Easy, Tasik. Dance, mother-in-law! Come on, put more zest in it! Don't stop! Faster! Dance, mother-in-law! Dance! Calm yourself, Tasik! Take it easy! What are you doing? You'll get it easier with Ghena! What Ghena? Ghena blew it long ago! There's no Ghena! Stasik... what's the matter with you, Stanislav Pavlovich? - People around. It's embarrassing! - Let everybody know! Eternal struggle! Of peace we only dream! Don't even think of it! What do you think? I have my own blue bird, too! And my own two birds in the bush! And I'll catch them, to spite you! Both of them! We shall, we shall enjoy, before our better days are through, A beauty and a goblet, a lucky saber, too. And swing, and swing, and swinging the feathers on our hats, We'll whisper to our fate: Merci beaucoup! All together now! Thank you. Bye now! Goodbye. Oh God! Oh God! What kind of people are they?! They've got everything and yet it's not enough for them! They don't know themselves what they want! Oh, mama dear! I'd better run from here for good! I can't stay here! Hey, man with a mustache! Oh, hello! I got no mustache anymore. - I shaved it off. - Why? You didn't like it. - I don't see any change. - Here. See? Right. Batalov's never had a mustache, but women are crazy about him. It's alright. Only my lip feels cool, not got used to it yet. What happened? Oh, yes, here's the key. Room 615. Your stuff's there. But what happened? I called your daughter, she's going crazy. So I thought you wouldn't come, it's raining. What happened? You see, I decided to go back to my husband. - To whom? - My husband. - Have you seen him? - Yes, I have. - And? - It's bad. Nobody knows where he works, he drinks. I'll take him back home. As they say, you're only good where you were born. Yes, yes... Well, it's the right thing to do. Yes, the right thing. And... So many years... But that's not important. And what about... But it's not important. That again? Don't oversleep the fishing season! Well... - As your granddaughter said... - Good luck! Oh, not this way. - Can I help you with your bags? - I'll do it myself. It's going to start now. - Do you hear me, mama? - I do. - I hope you're not angry with me? - Of course not. Anything happens. Shall we go into the car? You go. I'll manage. Hello! Traveling together again? I'm glad. I didn't forget you. This is Nina, my daughter. Your boys were good. Commend them and give them a rest. - Are you going, missis? - Yes, we are. Get in, mama. Go, or you'll be late for work. All right. Bye. He isn't coming, don't you understand? Your Lyamin called me and told me everything. Father will not come, it just can't be! You go, it's none of your business. Mama, what's the matter with you... You always want impossible. What are you waiting for? At least I'm waiting for something. Mama. Go. You'll be late for your work. If you're going, missis, then get in. We're starting! - Hi! - Greetings! - Who's leading yours? - Senior Lieutenant Smirnov. - I'll be by the train. - All right. Vera, come here! Marusya! Marusya! Let me through! Marusya! Vovchik! You've come after all! I didn't know what to think! Thank God I saw you! Oh, my God! Attention! First platoon, fall in! Oh, my God, Marusya! What a coincidence! I'm seeing my junior off to the army! Come on, you must meet them! My son and wife and granddaughter! What?! You're supposed to... We're supposed to go together! And I owe you a ruble! Attention! Let's go, Marusya, meet my wife, Lyuba! And our granddaughter, Margaritochka! Tell my son to take his hat, he's got a sick head! We'll make him healthy! - Whose child is this? - Over here! Slavik! Here he is, Marusya, my son! - Kirill, you haven't cut your hair? - Get acquainted! Bless the defender of our Motherland, Marusya. Be a good soldier and don't be angry with me. Don't forget to visit Father. Kiss each other! Come on, my dears! Margaritochka, come here, let me hold you, my darling! Look, she could have been your grandma! Kiss her! I want so much that the summer would've never ended, That it followed me suspended... My little girl, my darling, my only Irishka! My dear daughter! Let me through. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Grandma! Mama! Mama! - Grandma! - Wait, mama! Mama! Oh, my daughter... - Let me help you. - It's nothing, I'll carry the bag. Oh, mama, when I thought I'd never see you again, I got so scared! Where can I go from you? Grandma! We fight, we make up. We're kin, daughter. Are we going to sort it out who said what... Grandma, there's no pail here! You can't leave now! You'll have to stay! Will you stay, grandma? - What's up? What happened? - There's no pail, grandma. What?! What do you mean, no pail? You gave me such a fright! I was looking and looking ? no pail!
