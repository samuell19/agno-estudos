Franjo! What are you lads up to? Are you working or messing around? When you work, you don't mess around. - Understood? - Understood. Come on, comrades! My name is Malik Malkoc, but everybody calls me "Maliky Sticky-icky. " I was born November 2, 1 944, but Mama wrote I was born on October 29, because the war was on and we were poor so she could get an extra month 's allowance. My best friend is Joza. His full name is Serjoza Petrovic. He doesn't mind being called Joza, but if someone calls him "fatso, " he gets mad. WE BUY HERBS AND MUSHROOMS Franjo the janitor sings Mexican songs. When my dad asked him, "Why Mexican? " he said, "Comrade Mesa, nowadays, it's the safest. Such are the times. " Mama always tells him, "Franjo, don't drink. You'll ruin your health. " He smiles and says, "When I'm drunk, "my reflexes are quicker. "Who knows what would happened if I were sober? " He drinks up all the money he makes from the herbs because he loves 90-proof, plum brandy. But we're saving up our money to buy a genuine, leather football. They're going too far now. You're a swine, Mesa. You know that? Why? You don't know? You really don't know? I told you I had no idea I'd be promoted. What's the Party got to do with the divorce? Shut up. You tell me to shut up? You've been telling me that for two years. What am l, a whore? Shut up, you stupid bitch! - Got a light? - I've got nicer things. A nice girl, but a bit hot-tempered. I've got just the cure for her. You can't even get these in Paris. La Baiser, the queen of lipsticks. How much? Cheaper than a muzzle. How much? In view of the situation, only four dinars. Give me two. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! You don't love me anymore. - You don't! - Just be patient! When will you get a divorce? When? Never! Say something, for God's sake! You don't love me. Who loves anybody in this madhouse? I'll go to a rest home and bathe when it suits me. You only take one bath a year. There, they'd make you take two a week. While others fuck about, I have to bathe. Mama has ordered a big clean-up. My brother Mirza and I are to be circumcised. I asked Mirza what "circumcised" means. He says we're done for. They grab your prick and cut half of it off. Joza 's dad, Vlado Petrovic, was taken away by the men in leather coats. He shouted so that everybody could hear'. "I'd rather have Russian shit than American cake! " Later they took away their radio and telephone. I asked Joza why they did it. He said it was something to do with Stalin. We took all of Stalin 's pictures out of the house. We recognized him by his moustache. Since then, Joza 's mom first waits for the postman every day, then tells Joza she's going to the market and goes off to the council to ask about his dad. - How's my little Communist? - He's great, comrade. Here you are... Comrades. You've got no right. Give it... Give it here. Radio Sarajevo... We inform all citizens that vegetables will be available... Where have you been? For the lady of the house. Mirza! Look in my pocket. 50 mm. Chalk in the right hand, slate in the left. And for the mangy, old freeloader... I hoped you'd be gone when I returned. So did l, dear son-in-law. When will you leave and never return? You'll have a bloody, long wait. I know. Scram. You heard me! Go on, you pest. Get down! You shouldn't have. The latest craze in Zagreb. The slate indoors, the rattle outdoors, okay? Okay, dad. What are you waiting for? The movie. You can't watch it in daylight. Harder, harder. Our people must be prepared for anything. The danger of being thrown off-balance is a constant threat. Every individual must use maximum concentration and always make sure he has control over every part of his body. in order to perform his jump correctly. Any hasty move can lead him into a perilous situation. An incorrect position in flight can cost an individual his life or leave him maimed for life. Don't swing your arms when you walk. You can tell if someone's clever by the way he walks. How, Dad? The feet should be parallel. Whoever twists them this way is a fool. I don't understand, Dad. You will when you grow up. Communists have an inborn aesthetic sense. It's a fact. If you don't know that, you're a... Fool, dolt, nitwit, dumbbell. Comrades! Our physical, cultural movement, despite the present anti-Yugoslavian campaign, is growing stronger day by day. However, the attacks of Coninform have had its effects on the development of physical culture. in our country. Since their resolution, our physical culture has been subject to blatant discrimination by socialite countries. - Hello. - Hi, big brother. Are you taking care of my sister? No complaints. - How are you? - Fine. Let us welcome the first woman in this part of the Balkan Peninsula... who is going to fly a Hawk Glider'. Ankica Vidmar. Stop by for a drink tonight. I'm busy. She came here to help develop our physical culture. A date, eh? Yes. And you're not afraid? No, it doesn't take much courage. I come from a family of fliers. I just love flying. No doubt about it. She's modest and brave. A model, young Communist. Witty, isn't it? Don't you think? Some people wouldn't agree. With what? They don't think it's witty. Who doesn't think it's witty? You know him very well. Who? Your own brother-in-law. And what does he think? I don't know... That they're going too far. Three minutes left in the game. Vukas passes the ball from the left side. Mitic gets it, the Danish half in front of him. Mitic evades his opponent. A powerful shot! The fifth goal for our team! It's 5-0, Yugoslavia! We showed them, Comrade Mesa. - Damn good. - Huh? - Damn good. - Damn good. Come on, Muzafer, have one. - Come on. - No. Mrkusic, Horvat, Stankovic, Cajkovski, Jovanovic... Dazjic, Ognajanov, Mitic, Hocevar, Bobek, Vukas. Vukas broke through on the left and passed to the edge of the penalty area. Hocevar coolly put the ball into the net. That made it 2-0, Yugoslavia. In the second half, our team played very well, Ied by Mitic, who scored three goals. Hello, brother-in-law. Hello. You scared the hell out of me. Don't worry about it. Sit down. Sit down. Tell me first. Make yourself comfortable. I've no one to inform on. No, I can't. Come on, drink. I really can't. How's the job? Traveling? Too much. Twice a month. Everything's okay? As far as I know. And as far as you don't know? - Others know? - I'll say they do. You thought things could be kept hidden? No, it's like they say'. "The State Security knows everything." Sit down. Listen, she was mine, now she's yours. That's all. We don't arrest people for screwing. - What? - You heard. You mean, I'm-- Not yet. But God, himself, won't save you. - Djuro! - Yes? I don't need God. I'm clean as a whistle. Zijo... I'm having the children circumcised tomorrow. The old man's arranged it all. A fairy calls From atop Mount Trebevic Is Sarajevo still Where it used to be? Is the tavern still By the Moric Inn? Are they drinking wine Sarajevo's young folk? Are they served By the maid Mara? Is Mara wearing Three, fine skirts? Tighten your belt. You've no choice. Do you hear that, neighbor llanka? The crap I take from my own son. Fuck our Russian brothers, when they screw us. What have you done? I don't know. A mistake. Get back there. They'll notice. Please, go on. Anything left, butcher? Enough for a good screw. Beg your pardon, ladies. When they circumcised me, Mrs. Petrovic, there was enough skin left to make you a coat. Well done. Congratulations. You're my little hero, aren't you? Uncle. Will you buy me a football? I sure will. Did someone scream or am I hearing things? You're hearing things, Dad. I screamed. Are you all right? Yeah. Make sure you're healed up... when I get back. I don't want to find anybody still in bed, okay? Since dad's been away on business, everybody's tense-- Grandpa, mama-- everybody who comes to our house they all shake their heads, tick-tock, like a clock. Mama is always sewing. When she stops, she starts crying. Once I heard Mrs. Ilonka say to my mom, "Don't cry, Sena. "He's not an informer. He's something else. " "What else? " asked my mother. Mrs. Ilonla was silent, just like me when I tell a lie. Dad, get up! Get up. Malik's gone! Quick, quick! Wait, Sena! Telephone? It's the doorbell. Good morning. Is my brother here? He's asleep. Would you like to come in? Come in. What did you bring us? My pain, that's what. Can you sleep, brother? You see I can, sister. Well? I've been waiting for you to tell me. I thought you'd drop in. You used to come and visit your father. Where is he? Why doesn't he write? Listen, Sena. I'm serious. He'll write when he can. My brotherly advice is mind your own business. Don't ask anyone anything. Don't even come to see me anymore. Mind the children and your business. - He's your brother-in-law. - So what? I'm a soldier of the Party, understand? Understand what I'm saying? What's this? Some underwear. He went in thin socks, without a vest. Take it home. Can't you even slip him a parcel? You could when the Ustashas caught him. Leave it. Take this to Malik. The ball is on the goal line. A big chance for our team! Don't be an alcoholic like me. I've made my wife and child miserable, And my house was sold by other... other elements. My life is stormy... ruined. Someone else killed me. I'm still a man. I won't let anyone crush me. What are you doing? What's it to you? Wait! - It's not your money! - It's not yours either! - I earned it. - So what? - Give it back! - Get lost! Give it back. I'll hit you. Give it back! - Get up! - No! - Get up! - No, I want a football. Why are you hitting him? - What do you want? - What do you want? Give me the money! We thought... Fahro! Is Father dead? They've taken Mesa away. Look who's here. Uncle! Uncle! - Can we go to a movie? - If you sleep. - Go to sleep. - Okay. What movie will we see? "The Cow Jumped Over the Moon." Now, go to sleep. Look at the recruit! Look at the recruit! Recruit, Dad? I'm an old soldier. Sit down, son. Where are your wounds? I see you've had it pretty easy. Come on, talk. Do the kids know? No. Zijo made it look like a business trip. - They even said goodbye. - Zijo arranged it? He was here at the boys' circumcision. - There was singing... - The neighbors too? If you think you're going to waste Natasha's time... Does Zivka know about the letters? I didn't tell her. No one knows? Everyone knows. - What do they know? - What I saw. What did you see? A car and two men down below. Not that. I was thinking about Natasha. They shoved him in like a thief. What do you think, Dad? I saw nothing. I heard nothing. They were sitting here like normal people... and he left with Zijo like it was a business trip. Did you talk to Zijo? No. Why not? It's best just to forget about it. Attention! At ease. Attention! Right turn. Forward march! - Any word from your father? - No. - Is he dead? - No. What are you wearing? Nobody wants to tell us where he is. I wear it to spite them. Sarajevo again hosts a grand army parade. A review of the strength of our republic. - What are you doing, boy? - Nothing. Sit down! Sit down! Bimbo! The spray! Any film? Wait a second. What do you do with it all? Eat it? That's enough for this month. Do you want a poster? Off you go. That'll do for this month. Kiss me. - Why? - Just kiss me. - What is it? - A kiss! He's alive! Dear Daddy, We're all so glad you've written. and that you are well, but I am sorry that you have to do voluntary work in that mine. I'm writing this on the slate you brought me and Mama will copy it out on paper for you. We raised the money to visit you by selling the carpet from the living room. Only Franjo misses the carpet. He said, "What shall I beat now? " But later he whispered to me, "I'll be beating other carpets of Mesa 's. " I gave Mama the money I'd saved for a football. So don't worry. We're coming. You can expect us for sure on April 1 st. Lots of love, Malik. Everybody out! Fall in! Pick up your tools! Right face! Forward march! - What have they done? - I'm just getting old. You're not any taller or fatter. I told you to bring Malik, not a crybaby. What are you, a girl? He's just happy to see you. Well, good night. What's this? He started sleepwalking. I checked on him, and he was gone. - Why the bell? - Just to be safe. Have you found out why you're here? Ask your brother. I have. What did he say? He told me to mind my own business. - He married the gym teacher. - Ankica? Yes, she walks around the house naked. You could ask her of course. No, you'd better not. Forget it. When will they release you? I don't know. I don't know anything. - Talk about something else. - Such as? How are things in Sarajevo? Is Sarajevo still where it used to be? What's wrong? Why aren't you asleep? You're talking, but I have to be quiet. Come on, close your eyes. Can I come in with you? I'll stay with you until you fall asleep. Come on, settle down. Mama, why did we come here? We have to talk to this lady. Good. Take a break. How are you, young man? My, how you've grown! Would you like some candy? Come and sit over here. - How are you? - I'm all right. I went to see Mesa. How is he? When is he coming home? He told me to ask you. Me? How would I know? You don't know? You do know, you whore! You'll pay when we get home. You know why. I know. I was very sad when Joza's dad died. It reminded me of my dad. But I stopped being sad when I saw no one was crying. Joza told me his daddy hadn't actually died and his mom told mine, "My Vlado's dead. I'm sick of their lies. " She said, "I'll bury him just to spite them. " And the priest with the beard said, "We'll perform the service, but we won't record it. " Is anyone in the coffin? I know that when someone dies he is no more, but he can't just vanish. When Mama told me to shut up, I understood everything. I didn't even know Zvornik existed, till Dad sent us a letter saying he'd finished his work at the mine where Mom and I had visited him. Mirza showed it to me on the map, where they're building a hydroelectric station. I didn't feel like going to Zvornik, so I asked Mama why Dad couldn't come here instead of us going there. She said it was a cheaper place to live and would give us a fresh start. Grandpa said, "They're shoving him off again. " Mama said they call it "resocializing. " I just kept quiet. I was sorry to go, but glad we'd be together with Dad again. - Here, take this. - I've got enough. Take it. There are better days ahead. Mesa will be angry, Hamdo. Then let him send it back. Right, boy? Come on, take it. Take it, Sena. Give my regards to Mesa. - Have you told Grandpa? - Just a minute. Dad. Come here. What now? Fahro's letters. Give them to Natasha. Oh, I see. Those two are planning to... Oh, who's this I see? The general's up early. Don't make fun of me. Lucky you, dear girl. Be a good boy now. Let's get going. Good luck, and, God willing, I'll come visit you. I'll write as soon as we're settled. You father was buried long ago Buried in the damp earth Your brother went to Siberia long ago Long ago, clanging in shackles The Baikal vagabond went back To his mother Greetings, Mama Are Father and Brother well? Your brother went to Siberia long ago Long ago, clanging in shackles In the wild... - Where are you going? - T o Zvornik. The road's closed. Wait for the ferry. I drove here yesterday. Ah, my friend. Yesterday was yesterday and today is today. Got a cigarette? Dad! Doctor, this is my wife. This is the doctor, a great man. Evgeni Alexandrovich Liakhov. Your wife's lovely. So what's wrong with me? Glad to meet you. Welcome to Wetland. You're Russian? Yes, but I always say I'm a native of Zvornik. See? I'm a Yugoslav. I was just asking. My mother, rest her soul, Iike all Russian emigres, used to say, "Ubi bene, ibi patria." Really? Isn't it so? Yes. You two ride inside. I'll stay with the children. Ride with your wife. She's so scared. That's why a doctor should be with her. Come on. Hurry up. We'll capsize, Dad. No, we won't. The Drina's calm. In our new economic and social system tourism has been opened up to working people. Take that end. What'll we do with this? Throw it into the Drina. Gentleman from Sarajevo. That's right, boy from Sarajevo. Get washed. Dad, was your school big? Yes. - What color was it? - Yellow. - What color is my school? - Pink. Good morning. You're up early, doctor. Malik, this is Masa. Shake hands. Shake hands. - I'm late. - For what? For work. We should popularize our tourism abroad. It could play a much greater role than before the war. Lift your arm. That's right. Excuse me, again. I can never get the waist right the first time. What? It's fine. It was quite a job to organize resin collecting, to train the workers to get the most resin without impairing the quality of the wood. Many workers have mastered the job. Goodbye. Hello, hello. How are you? Fine. And you? No rest during the reconstruction. Jole, bring me a tablecloth! Private room? - Your idea? - Yes, the Union committee. We'll find a room later. Not bad. We'll make a report on it. Shall we knock one back? - During work hours? - I'll take responsibility. I fell in love on September 2nd, 1 951. That day, we beat Sweden 2-1. The goals were scored by Bobek and Ognajanov. I love doing homework with Masa. I would love it to last forever. Not the homework-- I hardly know what I'm writing-- but to rest my head on her shoulder. I make a move, my heart starts beating wildly. I quickly put on a straight face and go on writing. If she noticed something, I'd be embarrassed. Get Daddy. Doctor! Doctor! Quick! Mesa! Hello, Doctor. Come on up. Come and have a drink with us. I can't Ostoja. I'm in a hurry. Have a drink. I'd rather get going. Micko, is the car ready? Ready an hour ago. - She hasn't a chance. - The girl? They're changing her blood. She won't last long. Why him? It serves him right, having a child at 50. He lost his country. Let him at least have a child. - You know what? - What? You're a bullshitter. I just thought... If you'd been thinking, you wouldn't be here. I never heard of any boss who does the purchasing. Neither did l, but this one does. He does. You think I'd give money to those fools? Don't lose your hanky. What does it say here? Just read it. Is that whoring around? Three cases of rum, 70 kilos of lamb, 500 eggs. Is that whoring around? Yes, it is. All of Zvornik goes whoring at Koviljaca. Malik, get ready! You're going with me. If you don't believe me, ask your son. Three whoremongers three whoremongers... - Don't tip us over. - I won't. Just drive. We'll do the singing. He was only joking. All's well that ends well, right? Comrade Mesa! Malik's gone, Comrade Mesa! Malik's gone. - What's all the shouting? - Malik's gone. Find him, you idiot! Where's my son, you half-wit? - I fell asleep. - You fell asleep! How did it happen? I just turned around and he was gone. Nothing stops you, does it? I'd never go whoring with Micko. Yes, you would. He's no different. He'd sell out his own mother. Don't play the saint, you bastard! Do you take me for a fool? Cekic was with you. Micko won't give you away. Here, see? No hanky! You can't lie to me anymore, damn you! Don't go through my pockets. What have hankies got to do with it? Shut up. Did I spend two years crying for this? Did I leave my job for this? I sew like mad to give us a decent life... a normal life. And for who? For a shameless whore-chaser and a drunk. What's happening to me? What have I done to deserve this? It'd be better if you hadn't been released from jail. Shut up, you bitch. You should've killed yourself like Vlado! - Shut up, bitch. - You scum! Fuck you! Screw you! Leave me alone! Leave Vlado out of this! Shut up, you dumb bitch! Leave Vlado out of this! Take them off. You'll get them wet, and you'll have to wear mine. My friend Joza can put a stone in it. I can't. My amidja circumcised me. I know. Jews do it, too. What's an amidja? He's my dad's brother. A barber. A doctor can do it, too. It's all the same. It's not. It's better if a doctor does it. To reward me for my excellent grades, Dad took me to a bakery and said, "Order what you like. " I had four pies and was almost sick. Dad laughed and said, "You see, it doesn't pay to be excellent. " I knew he was only joking. When I told him I was picked to hand the Pioneers' Baton to the mayor, Dad stopped joking. He stopped going on purchasing trips. He kept pacing around the house, repeating, "I hope to God he doesn't mess it up. " Dear Mayor, I present to you this baton with a thousand greetings from Zvornik... with a thousand cordial greetings from Zvornik. Louder. Dear Mayor, I present to you this baton with a thousand cordial greetings. Is your son a bit...? No, he's not. He's going to present the baton. The Pioneers of Zvornik vow again to study and work diligently and acquire new knowledge. New knowledge... For the benefit and prosperity of our... Our... socialist community and keep walking on the... On the revolutionary path. Path... that our nation is following... Ied by Comrade Tito and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Good. More tomorrow. Now, off to bed. Take it off. When's the fitting? Right after the holidays. Tomorrow, when you're with the mayor, the words should roll off your tongue. And don't start fidgeting. When you run up to him, stand proudly. Don't be shy. Let your gestures suit your words. But don't overdo it. - You know? - I know, Dad. Go to sleep. Dear Mayor, I present to you this baton... Mesa, let's go play a game of chess. Don't be provocative, Cekic. What would Nikola say if he heard you? You'd go if it weren't for your son. Let me hear him. We, the Pioneers of Zvornik vow again to diligently... study and work... and acquire new knowledge... and keep walking on the path... followed by... Tito... Ied by the Party. Comrades, today, on this festive day, the people of our district join in a day of great national joy. we have gathered here to welcome the baton through which the people of Bosnia send their love to their greatest teacher. It was the pin, Dad. The pin's to blame for everything. What pin? It slipped out. - Shall I repeat it for you? - No. Will you be my little Communist? Comrade Cekic wants you to come at once. Who wrote this speech? You know very well who wrote it. You didn't, by chance, change anything? Do you think I'm crazy? Is the Party leading Tito or Tito the Party? It makes no difference. But how would you put it? I believe it makes no difference. The Party teaches us... Tito is the Party, the party is Tito and Tito is all of us. Sounds great. Would you like a drink? I've got this French shit. Well, brother, congratulations. Are you making fun of me, Cekic? Congratulations for what? Your Zvornik mandate has expired. - It's over. - Over. You can go to Sarajevo or wherever you like. Calm down. Sit down. You'll play one last game with me. Masa! I knew you'd come. I brought the bell. But you mustn't read it here. Why, Masa? You mustn't, that's all. Do you promise? Whatever you say. Say, "l promise." Now you're crying. How do you know? Sometimes I know everything. Your mom cries too. Yes, she does. She shouldn't. That's what I keep telling her. Give me your hand. Do you love me? More than anyone in the world. More than myself. Stand back, son. Masa never came back. The doctor came to our house wearing a black armband on his white coat. I was under the quilt and I heard the doctor say to Mama in Russian, "Sister, what's the point of life? " Thank God your troubles are over. What do you expect from a democracy? Don't talk about democracy. The coffers are empty. Don't worry. We'll make money. We'll print our own. Money has nothing to do with democracy. Some politician you are. Everything on Earth has to do with money. I'm telling you, if the coffers are empty, there's no democracy. What's that? What about your uncle? Have you forgiven me? I can forget. But forgive... Why did you invite me then? To talk, like two adults. Do you still think the same? About what? That I was guilty? What I think doesn't matter anymore. It did then. Did you put me away for my words or my thoughts? - I didn't put you away. - So who did? Your own tongue. My own brother-in-law did. During that craziness, it was brother against brother. You should make up with your sister. She's your flesh and blood. - The Pope's drinking? - lndeed he is! Come over here. - What? - Sit down. Why? I'm busy. - What? - You go outside. Sit beside Zijo and talk to him as if nothing happened. Never. You'll do as I say. Never, Mesa. Don't make me angry. I'll die first. Can't you sleep, brother? Not well, sister. Where are the parcels? In the pantry. Ask Ankica. So, you're not sleeping well, brother? Hardly at all, sister. What do the doctors say? That you can live to 1 00 with diabetes. Does the brandy help? Temporarily. It's not easy for you. I understand you perfectly. Oh, Zijo, you and your fucking brandy. Why don't you cut yourself up at your own wedding? Mirza, come here. My suitcase is in the pantry. Go take it down for me. Are you going somewhere? Just take it down and wait for me. The game against the Soviet Union has begun... It wasn't my fault, Mesa. I just said you said, "Who loves anybody in this madhouse." I didn't know he'd arrest you, his own brother-in-law. I just said... that you said that cartoon was overdone. I love you, Mesa. I couldn't wait for you, Mesa. Why are you crying? I don't know. All I need is you crying and I'll give birth right here. My grandfather Muzafer left our house for a nursing home on July 22, 1952. I don't know if it was because he wouldn't bathe or some other reason. I only know he told Mirza, "Tell them I said I'm sick and tired of their politics. I'm too old for that crap." And he added, "If you want to visit, Travnik isn't very far. It's all over! We've won! In its second attempt, the Yugoslav team has succeeded in qualifying for the quarter-finals of the Olympic competition. Two days ago, we tied the Russians 5-5, but today we surpassed them in every aspect. A richly deserved 3-1 victory. Those names will be forever remembered in the history of Yugoslav sport.
