This is Detective Jack Mosley. Shield number 227. I guess this'll be my last will and testament. This is for Diane. When this day is over, they're gonna come and... talk to you about this, and they're gonna... they're gonna tell you what happened, Diane. But what they tell you is not really what happened here. So I hope that you get this. I was trying to do a good thing. Police! Get Down! Everybody down! Down! Down! Go, go, go! Come on! Clear! Police! Get down! Seal it off! Agent Sinclair, we're all secure. All right, we're out of here. Couple of hours. We got to move now. Would you turn that thing off? All right, who's downstairs we don't need? All yours. Good luck. Hey, I hate to do this to you, Jack, but I need you to sit on this until uniforms get here. All right. Just hang until you're relieved. All right. All right. Don't touch anything. Any word on the suspect, sir? Anything for me? Breath mint. Sergeant Kenoble called. Wants you to write up, uh, this wire request. Said to make sure that you get the right dates on 'em this time. The particulars are on your desk, and he needs it by tonight. All right. Hey, hey, Jack, I forgot to tell you the lieutenant's looking for you. He wants you to find him right away. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Mosley. Mosley! Yeah? Grace tell you to find me? Yeah. Uh, just a minute ago. All right, I need a favor. Got to get this guy from lockup and run him over to Center Street. The D.A. needs him ASAP-- he's got to be in front of a grand jury before 10:00. Ah. I signed out. You signed the sheet? Well... not technically, no, but I mean, I'm signed out... Well, then consider yourself on overtime. Captain Dribble called me. We need this thing done. Don't you have some regular mutt that takes care of this? I got Keenan, but he's still on the Verazano. He's behind some overturned truck. I'm tired. I mean, look, normally, you know me, I don't say no... Yeah, I know you've been working all night, Jack, but... I'm just tired. who's the detective and who's the lieutenant here? I mean, Jack, I got nobody else. It's a nothing thing. 118 minutes to get a little hemorrhoid 16 blocks. I'll let you come in work late tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. Edward Bunker. Yeah, that's me, Officer, Eddie Bunker, right here, down here in the last cell, right here. Come back in an hour. What do you mean, come back in an hour? He's supposed to wear a suit when he leaves. And? It's not here yet. Just get him out here, all right? They said he'd wear a suit. No, yeah, I'm-I'm supposed to get a suit. It's a three-piece suit, it's gray. It's got, wait, yeah, it's-it's, uh, three buttons, it's gray, it's got cuffs on the pants. They brought the catalog down, I picked it out of the catalog. I'm not supposed to leave without it. Wait. They said I'm not supposed to leave without that suit. You tell it to him. Come on. No, I'm not supposed to leave without that suit. That's why they brought my shoes in earlier. Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on. I'm not supposed to leave. Yo, yo, you take the old lady, right? Yeah? You sure? Yeah, the old lady goes into the car, otherwise she dies, man. Oh, yeah, you think so? Yeah, man. If that's what you wanna... I don't know, you got to figure out the answer for yourself. Hold... Everybody just calm down. Officer, I'm going to court. I'm supposed to have a suit. Hey, shut up. I got to get... Here's your property. Hands behind your back. Hold on, I'm just... I'm trying to get my... Hands behind your back. I'm trying to get... I don't have my... all my... prop... Wait one minute... Ow. It's not right. They promised me the suit. Came on, picked out the catalog. Wait, wait, my book! I can't leave without my book. My book's very important to me. What book? Why are we rushing like this? Let's go. Not a good sign. Hey. What's the damn answer? Hey! Shut up! I hate police, man. Half a tank. You know, you could've had a little more patience with the suit, man. Probably don't mean nothing to you. You probably have a bunch of suits. Whole different thing to me. These cars don't never change, huh? Traditional cruisers. The same retarded hump in the middle. Smell... the same way. Like Lysol and vomit. Hope nobody vomited back here. They probably did. Hey, man, let me ask you something. I'm trying to figure this out. Uh... You're driving along in a hurricane, right? There's three people at the bus stop. You know, one is a old lady. She's sick, she about to die. The second one is your best friend. He saved your life. Right? And the third is the girl of your dreams. Right? But check it out. You only got space in the car for one person. Right? Who do you take? You know, I-I mean, it's a ancient riddle that's supposed to tell what type of person you are, like where you at in your life. It's a hypothetical question, man, damn. It is a hypothetical... Good. Fine, good. I guess that's my answer. Hey, man, why don't you get on the loudspeaker. Put the-the-the Hawaii five-oh light on or something. Use your police power. Put on a little siren. Make-make 'em move, make a hole. You see what I'm saying, make a hole, make a hole. Gonna make a hole. Signs. Everywhere, signs, signs, signs. All over, man. I-I used to not even see nothing like that, man, and then... I start seeing 'em. You know, I start looking for 'em, and everything just started falling in place. It'll be all right, where I'm supposed to be. I-I ain't got my suit, but... once I give my testimony, they drop my charges, I'm free. It's making sense to me. I believe in that. Being in the right place, being where you're supposed to be. You believe in that? I believe life's too long, and guys like you make it even longer. Life's too long? Man. That's some cold shit, man. I never heard nobody say no shit like that. Usually you hear about people trying to make their life longer, you know? Trying to stay alive a little longer. You sound a little... depressed or something-- you all right? We're s... we're stopping. This ain't the courthouse, man. What you doing? Yo. Yo, why are you stopping? You gonna bust me out to court, and now you... you stopping? What are you... Hey! Hey, man, hey, man, listen, man, I got a important appointment as to my court date, man. That shit ain't funny, man. Come on, man. It's not a game, man. Yo! Bullshit, man. Hey! Hey! Nah, man, it ain't Miller time, man. The weather will be clear all morning, but the rest of the day... Sam. Hey, Angela. The usual. So we are looking at a hot, humid day. Looks like temperature might reach a hundred degrees, so don't forget to... Add a pack of these in there. I knew this dude smelled funny. I got the wrong dude, man. $17.50. Hey, don't open it! Mm. Oh, this is... 8:11. That's a good sign, that's a good sign. I'm on my way, I'll get there. Huh? Want change? Uh, you keep the change. Keep the change. All right, you have a good day. Smile. Cheer... I don't want the change. Bye. Nah, man, I can't do nothin' for you, man, you understand? Hey, you better give me that change. I-I'm gonna need that. You see my situation right here? No, no, no! No, no! No! Hey! Get me out! Come on! My book! Go, go, go! Left! Oh! Oh! Oh! Wait! In here! Come on! Shit! Oh, sh... Hey! Get out of here! Now! Go on! Go! Come on, let's go. That way. Let's go. Go, go. Right here. Here. Let's go, let's go. Dominic, you better get your people out of here right now. Jesus, Jack, what the hell's going on? Everybody. You, too. All right, all... Let's go. Come on, come on, come on. Que paso? Hey, yo! Come on, get going! Come on! Come on, move it! Yeah, uh, this is Detective Jack Mosley, uh, shield number 227. Uh, I am 10-13 at, uh... Hold on a minute. Dominic? Yeah? What's the address here? 133 Mulberry. At 133 Mulberry. Mulberry Street. All right. Is they comin'? I don't know why you stopped, man. I don't know why you would do that, man. He says you're a nobody. I ain't nobody. Shut up. You're a wino. You need to stop drinking, that's what you need to stop doing. Shut... up. Jack? Frank. Hey. You all right? Yeah. Yeah? Well, we were over on Mott when the, uh, call went out. Heard it was you. Got here as soon as we could. Oh. Hi. Hey. You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Uh-huh? Uh-huh? You having fun? No. No? Oh, no. You got to have fun. What's up, Jack? Hey, man. Hi. You did a... you did a really great, great job here. You got yourself a bad guy. Mm? Been a while, huh? Yeah. We got the, uh, we got the second shooter half a block from here, so... it's done. Sure you're okay? Yeah. I'm just... getting my wind. I was running. Oh. Why don't you... why don't you let us take it from here? Oh. Yeah. You know? We'll get the kid where he belongs, and you don't have to worry about a thing. We'll get you home. Yes, please. Please, please, Officer, that's a very good idea, 'cause honestly, I don't think this dude is doing too good. I told him not to stop, I asked him not to stop, please not to stop-- he just had to stop, and that's when everything happened. That's when the dude came up to the window. I have a very important appointment at... Jack? Hey, Shue. Come on. Why don't you take this. Come on, man. We'll get you out of here; got a car waiting, all right? Get some sleep. Jack. The kid was gonna testify against Jerry. He saw Jerry doing some business. Now, we both know that Jerry has never been a standup guy like you and me. He'll roll over, they indict him. We can't have that. No. He's gonna hurt a lot of us. Come on. See, this whole thing caught us... it caught us completely unaware. You know, it was supposed to be Teach's nephew driving him. But he got stuck out there in traffic, who knows where, and... so your lieutenant, he picked you. You know... just the wrong time and the wrong place for you today. All right? Now, you know that... I would never put you in a position like this, right? You know that, huh? And I never figured you'd cap one of those guys. That's what I get for hiring drug addicts. Grab the gun. Grab the gun. Come on. Frank? Huh? Here we go. All right, here we go. Jack. Squeeze the trigger. All right, let go of the gun. Let go of the gun. I figure it like this. You, uh, you popped the guys trying to spring the kid. The kid, well, he got your gun. And he takes you hostage. So we came in and saved the day. He died. You lived. Now, this could be a good thing for you, Jack. Get you back where you belong. Are you still with, um... you still with, uh... what's her name? What are you waiting for? What's her name? What's her name? Caroline. It's Caroline. This changes everything, Jack. Over here. Come on, Frank. Kid... get up. All right, Jack, it's 8:25. Stay there. Listen to me, the jury's tenure ends at 10:00, all right? The kid gets there one minute past, all this... ...it doesn't matter. All right? And all you got to do is look the other way. All right? We still got options here. Okay? We just want the kid. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, just let me help you. All right? Back up. Jack, once you go out that door, I can't help you. Please back up, Frank. Just back up. He shot a cop. What the hell did you see? Huh? What'd you see?! That cop back there, I seen him around my way holding a gun on this... this little Puerto Rican kid. Come on. Let's go. He said he'd kill his mother if he testified. Hey, what'd you do that for? We need that! The shell in that gun was over 20 years old. What? Lucky it went off at all. They didn't tell you Jerry Shue was a cop, right? No, they ain't tell me he was no cop. They showed me a picture, that was it. They ain't say nothin'. Well, congratulations. 'Cause you're about to testify against one of New York's worst. What?! All right, fellas, look, the clock's ticking. We know he's got to be at the courthouse by 10:00. We know where he's going. Okay? Mulvey, you're coming with me. You all know where you're going? Go. We'll take the north side. You got it. Let's go. Captain. Where are we, Frank? We're putting descriptions out over precinct channels. No names, but one's a cop. It'd help to have some eyes. How long can you sit on this? Shot a cop? You're the precinct captain, Dan. How long? I don't know. Hour. Maybe a little more. Who's on this with you? Well, my guys. Ortiz and Maldonado from the, uh, 66. Twohy and Kaller from the 111, couple others you don't want to know about. The guy was your partner for 20 years. What the hell happened in there? Is he drunk? I don't know. I don't know. We woke him up. Hopefully, he'll do what he always does and we can all go back to work. If he doesn't? We got to quash this thing, before he gets his legs back. These are his streets. This could get ugly... for all of us if that kid talks. He can't talk. He won't talk. Look, man, I-I appreciate what you did for me back there, but I'm starting to think that you're not the dude for this job. I mean, you're out of... you're out of breath, you're hung over, your leg is gonna give out any second, man. I got someplace I need to be at 12:00, you understand? In order to be there, I need to be finished at court by 10:00, or I'm not gonna get where I'm supposed to get. I got to be finished in court by 10:00. You understand what I'm saying? All right, I understand. You're not listening to what I'm saying. Wait, wait. Come here. Hung over... Bad leg... No gun... Bobby. Yeah? You thinking what I'm thinking? Already there. Oh, God. Come on, let's go. Listen. Please, stay put right here. I'll be right back. Come on, man, don't take long. Man, we gotta go. Hurry up. Hey, where your bathroom? What?! Your bathroom. Where your bathroom at? Down at the end of the hall. Yeah. That's what you look like when you smile, huh? You was... probably drinking there, too. Yes, indeed. Redhead. Cute. That ain't bad. Hey, hey, man. Come on, man. Don't be stopping to get high or nothing like that, man. We gotta go. Make sure you lift the seat up before you go. It's up already. Maybe you left it like that, huh? Come on. Hey, Jack. Jack Mosley. Why you do that? Do what? Shoot that cop. Cops... they won't shoot other cops. Especially over nobody like me. It's a long way to go for a stranger, you know, um... Um... thank you. I never had nobody... Aw, hell, man, you know? I don't rock with the police, you know what I'm saying, Jack? Finger off the trigger. Here you come. Y'all bail me out. You want a vigilante... Let's go. Whatever it is... Jack... Put your arms around the pole. I really don't know what to think, Jack Mosley. Here, cuff yourself. What are you doing, Jack? ...a little strange, you know? By any definition, you see? All right, kid. Good. Huh, okay. Okay. Okay, okay... Uh... okay. Okay. You should've done what you always do, Jack. Where's your phone? It's on the left-hand side. They know I'm here; if I don't answer it... Jack? Let's go, kid. Come on. Bob... Bob's a little tied up right now, Frank. All right, I'm impressed, Jack. Did you shoot him, too? Send someone to check on Bobby. Jack, you're not up to this. All right? It's going to end bad for you. Oh... You lost the kid, didn't you? Huh? He bailed on you. Well, you know what? That is the best thing that could've happened to you. So why don't you go home, and forget about what happened, and we'll take it from here. Now, you're just looking around for him, aren't you? And you can't find him. We're going to find him. All right? We're going to find him. All right, Jack? Now you can hang up. Where are you, kid? All right. Now let's see which way he went. Did he go up? Or did he go down? In or out, Jackie? Which way'd he go? Let's see if he went down. Excuse me, sir, do you mind swipe...? Get a job! Excuse me, ma'am, would you mind swiping me in, please? Ma'am? Ma'am, would you mind swiping me in, please? I have a very important appointment I have to... Excuse me, ma'am, would you... No, I can't help you. Would you mind... somebody mind swiping me in, please? I'm trying to get to an important... appointment. Somebody help... somebody help me. Somebody help me. Hey. Huh? Come here. Come on. Go. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey! Oh, no... What are you doing?! What are you doing?! What did you run away for?! What do you want from me?! It's too much, man. Look, I'm doing the rest of this on my own, okay? I'm doing what I said I was going to do. I'm getting out of here. If I can find you, they can find you. If I can find you, they can find you! Eddie, listen to me, listen to me. Listen to me! I am your only friend out here, all right? No, you ain't my friend. I can do this, Ed. Listen to me! You're my friend?! You don't even know me! And get me where? Boy, you gonna get me shot! Ever since I been with you, people been trying to shoot me-- people you know! Look, man, I got someplace I need to be. I got something I need to do, and unless you're gonna shoot me or arrest me right here, I'm going. I can't let you leave. Do you understand? Thank you, Jack Mosley. I'm going. You cannot leave! Thank you. Yes, I can. Thank you, Jack Mosley. Stop! Don't do that! Stop! I am not joking! Let me... come here! Stop! Eddie! Okay, okay, okay, we got to go. Move! Move! Out of the way! Move! Move! Here, come on. What are you doing? Taxi! Hey! Hey! Taxi! It's Kaller. Just missed him at the Canal Street Station. Where, where, where, where, where, where, where? Shit. Where the hell is he? Goddamn it. We're going to find you. Yeah, this is Detective Nugent. I need a triangulation on Detective Torres' cell phone. Area code 917-935... That cop back at the apartment, he said you should do what you always do. What'd he... what'd he mean by that? You're not... you're not doing what you always do, huh? Jack Mosley, I get it. I seen the sign. I'm wh... I'm where I'm supposed to be. I was wrong. You're the right guy. I could've got another guy, did something different, but I got you. I appreciate it. You're the right guy, okay? Okay, okay. This is contact. Over. Yeah, go. This is Nugent. Uh, GPS indicates they're on Bowery. Repeat, Bowery moving south towards Pell. Speed indicates they're on foot. Are you hearing this, boys? He's in Chinatown. Let's move in. What's the deal with that book? It's my business plans. I'm moving to Seattle. My sister's already living out there. I'm going to open up a bakery, but it's only, like, a specialty bakery. You know, like birthday cakes for little kids. There's a lot of money in that. Well, how about this? When's your birthday? I'm going to send you a big birthday cake on your birthday. I hate birthday cakes. What do you mean, you hate birthday cakes? What kind of person... The first thing that doesn't go your way, you're going to be slipping into Carol's Clip and Curl, stealing all her hair care products, because you're a thief. And that's what you are, Eddie. You're a thief. No, no, no, I ain't. You're always going to be a thief. People can change, Jack. Days change, seasons change, not people. Yes, they do. People don't change, Eddie. Yes, they do. You know what? I'm going to get you that cake, and you know what it's going to say on the top of it, right? "Jack Mosley, ha-ha-ha, eat this." I'm going to make you eat your words, lick your fingers, too. Subject's moving west on Pell. Subject now moving south on Doyers. Still moving south on Doyers. All right, Bobby, you take Doyers. We got Pell. And, Kaller, you close up Bowery. Let's squeeze them. Copy that. On my way. Let's pull up. Pull up. Sorry. You can't go in there. Oh, sor-sorry. Look, man, I-I-I got to... I got to be down there. All right? You understand? See, I got to be down there that way, and there's streets and shit in between there. Um, do you have some sort of plans? Police plans or something? See you limp backing up there. You really ought to get that checked out, man. I had a buddy of mine walking around with a limp just like that-- he didn't want to go to the doctor, though, right? Finally, he go. They say it's a fracture, right? And now it's infected. They got to cut it off at the knee. Wasn't so bad, though. He had no more pain. Matter of fact, he ended up moving to Jersey, working for the PATH, being a motorman. Got a pension and shit now. Guess everything happened for a reason, you know what I mean? You're a sunny little shit, I'll give you that much. Get in here! Get in this door! Pull me in! Help me in! Come on, come on, come on! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! You all right, man? Yeah. Hey, what are we doing? Where are we going? Hey. What's up? Where we going, Jack? Out of the way. Out of the way. Out of the way. Okay. Jack, how do we know that Center Street Courthouse is in this direction? Jack? Jack? We got to know... Get down! Go! Come on! Kaller! Push it! You all right, Jack? I was aiming for the kid, if that makes you feel better. You missed! That kid is gonna get you killed. He worth that? I got all day. How about you? You got all day? Jack, you still there? Yeah... still here. Well, this is awkward. When I started this day... I never figured on trading nine-mils with my friend. I think we stopped being friends right around 8:25, in that bar. No. No, that's not going to erase... 20 years together. We're still friends. Look... a lot I'd take back, but I can't. Well... so you move forward. Next day, next case. Lines were crossed. What lines? You hear me? Lines were crossed, Frank. What lines? There are no lines! There's getting it done and not getting it done, period! You put the bad guys away no matter what it takes. Now, you're going to ruin the lives... of six cops. Good cops. Good men. Are you ready to sacrifice their lives for that kid? Hey, Frank... Frank! Yeah? This is not about me ruining anybody's life, okay? This is about you. You hear me? Yeah. You look at that kid's jacket? Hmm? I did. Armed robbery, assault... I never had no armed robbery! I-I never... I never even used a... One time, I used a... Shh, shh! Shut up, shut up. Oh, no, don't tell him to shut up. No, Jack, listen to him. Oh, that kid, he's, uh... he's sharp. Yeah, he's playing you. He's sharper than you are. He's telling you stories, right? He wants to be a good citizen, go to church, buy his mother a house. But he has spent more than half his life in prison. Two hours ago, he was sitting in a cell for weapons possession. Wasn't me, Jack. He is always going to do what he has done. He is a career criminal. That's who you're protecting. You all right? Yeah. Frank's got him on the other side. He's got my gun, too. If you can't see how wrong this is, I promise you, I will speak from my heart... when I give the eulogy at your funeral. So... you believe the kid? Or do you believe your ex-partner? Frank, we're right on the other side of the door. 'Cause... if you believe the kid... ...you've got a choice to make. You go through your ex-partner... ...or do you choose door number two to go back to where you came with your gimpy leg and your shot-up hand? Huh? You're not going to get very far, and what if your ex-partner is right, Jack? What if he is right, and you wasted your whole miserable life? Frank? You all right? Yeah. They're in the elevator. Seal the building. Come on, Bobby. Come on, get down there, Bobby. Everybody out! Police! Everybody out! Everybody out! Police! Hey, Brian. I hear them coming up. All right, come on, come on, come on, upstairs. Seal the stairwell. All right. Bobby, find the back stairs. Check the roof. Come on, Mal, this way. Maldonado. Okay. Seal it up. Gotcha. Hello? Hello? Hello? No, no, nothing. No answer. Not there. Come on. I never open door. Please, please... please help. Come on. See? Hey. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You saw that, right? - You heard him, right? - Yeah. He never opens the door. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Y-You heard him, right, Jack? Shh! Not now, Eddie. Keep your voice down. He said he never open the door. You-you know what that mean, right? Oh, my God. There's signs everywhere. Yeah, um, I need Ann McDonald, please? May I tell her who's calling? Yeah, tell her it's the guy who's got her witness. You're driving a car through a hurricane, all right? Like... Hurricane. And there's three people at a bus stop: a old woman... Yeah. ...uh, a friend, like my friend here... Him-- he'll save your life-- your friend. It's Detective Mosley for you. Mosley. Yeah. Where the hell are you? Where's my witness? I'm about seven blocks from you. There's about a ton of cops between me and you, and they all want this kid dead. Not to mention the fact that you got a leak in your office. Somebody's talking to these cops, you hear me? Shit! Well, what did you think was going to happen when you pinched Shue? You think they're all just going to lay down and go away quietly? We thought if we went to the grand jury, Shue would fold. He bent but didn't break. We were going to throw it away until we ran into Edward Bunker last night. Jury's tenure ends at 10:00. Without that kid, they'll vote no bill, and it all goes away. He's an eyewitness. He makes this work. Where are you? I'll send my squad. Richard! Ken! What room? So... a-are they coming? Yeah, they're coming. Good, 'cause I got... I got to be somewhere, man. I got something to do. I got to be someplace by noon. I-I got... I got to go get something. It's real important. Oh, shit. Yeah. Ortiz, I'm coming in the building. Frank? All right. Twohy and Kaller are taken care of. Good. Go find Bobby. He's on the back stairs. Eddie, here, come here. Put this on. Here, come on, put that on. Put it on. I don't wanna put this... It's a big, hot wool shirt. It's hot... it's summer. You're dressed like a criminal. Oh, you want me to... you want me to change my... Okay, I get it. But let me put that on. What about this one? Look. Look. What about that one? What's wrong with this? It's just the pattern. He don't even wear that shirt. Just put the... Here... Never mind. What about this? This is... Is this all right? Mass transit blue? When I was locked up, they had me working the kitchen, right? So, one day, little dude walk up to me, say, "Hey, man, you think you bake me a cake?" I say, "Yeah, I'll bake you a cake." You know, I ain't tell him I ain't never baked a cake. You know, I... but I ain't got shit else to do, so, uh... You know, I read the instructions. I bake him a cake, you know, for his daughter's birthday when she come up there to visit. And it say: "Happy Birthday, Angel," right? He go crazy. He can't get enough, you know. He say, "Oh, Eddie, man, hook me up, man, you the man." And I start doing that for good, you know. I had a skill; people looking at me different and start... You missed a button. Did I? The buttons are all crooked. Come on. Come on, man. All right. Nugent. You're a prince. Word is 5-E, boys, 5-E. Got it. Then I started doing my research, doing my due diligence, I find out, you know, it's good money in birthday cakes for kids, you know? That type of thing like Tweety Bird or Bugs Bunny or something like that... or... or Yu-Gi-Oh. You ever heard of Yu-Gi-Oh? Yu-Gi-Oh! Yu-Gi-Oh! Kids love that, man. You don't know Yu-Gi-Oh.

Commissioner? Look, sir... this is just an unfortunate accident. Look, this is my fault, all right? I used to work with Detective Mosley, so I asked the cap to let me handle it.

Yeah, e-every day is somebody's birthday, you know? That's gonna be the-the-the motto for my shop: "Every day is a birthday," you know? I didn't know my birthday's gonna turn out like this, but, uh... yeah, I'm glad to be, you know, here alive, you know? Right here, Jack. Yeah, Sheehan? Commissioner, Commissioner, sir? Sheehan? Right here. All right, this is what I want. I want you to get me Assistant District Attorney McDonald, a court stenographer and somebody from TV-- somebody that I would recognize. I want them to come on the bus and record sworn testimony. When I get what I want, I let everybody out... safely. Jack, that's a tall order. That's gonna take... Just do it. I'm not in the mood, okay? Get these people here in 15 minutes, or I'm gonna start shooting these passengers one at a time and throwing them out the door. Jack, be cool, okay? Let's not do anything rash. This thing can end without bloodshed, okay? 15 minutes. We can work this... Jack? Jack? He's gone. All right, everybody on your feet. Jack, what are you doing?

Mosley is still on the bus, and that kid is here somewhere. I already checked... I don't care, Bobby. I don't care what you checked. Check it again. Now, go. This is Detective Jack Mosley. Shield number 227. I guess this will be my last will and testament. Don't shoot! Hold your fire! Do not shoot! Do not shoot! Who is that? Hold your fire! Is that Weir from the 3-2? Get on your goddamn radio. Find out who the hell that is. Get down! Hold your fire! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Do not move! Don't shoot! Hold your fire! Get away from the bus! Do not shoot! Hold your fire. Jack? Jack, it's me. Hey, Mosley. It's me, Eddie, Jack. Chuck Berry. Chuck Berry. Chuck Berry... he got locked up for armed robbery. He changed. He changed. Barry White, he stole 300 ties. Can you pic... Can you picture big Barry White stealing 300 ties? He changed. You said, you said people don't change. People change. Eddie... What? You're killin' me. Team three, breach the bus. Repeat, team three, breach the bus. Stay out of the way. Head down! Cover your ears and your eyes! Finish it! Go! Go! Fire! Is that shots fired? Shots fired. Let's go! Move! Move! Move! Move up! Move up! Take it. Go. The bus is empty. They went through the bus doors! They're in the goddamn building! Seal it off! It's all clear. The bus is empty. They've entered the building. Seal the building, start the search. Heads up. He just shot two cops. Careful. Jack, I got to tell you something. Hey, man, Jack, listen to me, man. Jack, I want to tell you something. Hold on, hold on, wait. I got to tell you something. It's important. Get up, get up. Oh, shit... Oh, shit... Hey, sir, sir, listen, I'm a cop, all right? I'm on a job. Look, I need that phone from you, let me have it from you. Look what they did to my suit, man. I told you you was gonna get me shot. It's me. I need your help. All this started 'cause my friend Maurice came by my house. A few days ago, Maurice came to my house. He came all excited. He got a shoe box, he got a gun. He talking about, "Hold this for me for a little while." I'm, like, "I'm on a parole." He, like, "Me, too." Next day, somebody shot him. $32,000 in that shoe box. That's a sign, huh? Yeah, that's a very big sign. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Yeah. You know how much it's gonna take me to open the bakery? $31,000. Jack, I got so nervous, I ran out the house, I went to Port Authority and I put the money in a locker. I get back to my house, my parole officer's there. In my house. He got Maurice's gun in his hand. He lookin' at me, like, "That's it, Eddie." And he talking about 15 years, man. I was so scared. Then the DA came to my cell... He showed me the picture of that cop. Then I met you. Jack... they clean them lockers out every 24 hours. I had a little schedule going, man. Court at 10:00, Port Authority at 12:00... Hey, hey, look at me... wake up. You ain't gonna die on me, are you? I don't know, I never died before. It's not gonna happen today. Hey. Thank you for coming. What's going on? Look. Shot through here. I think it went in and out. Yeah, let's get him in. I know you. Come on. I was at your house. You were at my apartment? Had to get my gun. Big mouth. Yeah, it was very nice. Very clean. Police were grilling me for an hour at the hospital. What'd you say to them? That you're a self-medicating, depressed individual, and that you don't care anymore, about anything or anyone. Oh, that's honest, straightforward. That's sexy, I like that. What'd you do this time, Jack? He saved my life a couple of times. Hey, he's a good dude. You gotta give him another chance. I don't know what he did, but you got to give him another chance. He got to have somebody to talk to. I'm not gonna be around. Eddie, this is my sister, Diane. What? She's your sister. Mm-hmm. Aw, man. I just started having a little hope for you, man. Your family don't even like you. I got a sister, too. She lives in Seattle. Supposed to go out there and start my bakery. I supposed to go out there today, see if... Look, I can stop the bleeding, but he's got to get stitched up. He's got to get to a hospital. We got to be at the courthouse in less than 20 minutes. You're gonna have to do it. You're gonna be fine, Eddie. It's not as bad as it looks. What happened to your hand? I got to ask you one more favor. Just a little favor. Hey, is today really your birthday? No. No, I only said that 'cause the little girl, she was all scared. She was cute, right? When's your birthday? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? No, for real. I don't know. You know, 'cause I came up through foster care. Had a lot of birthdays. Didn't you say you, you got... You got a sister, right? Yeah. That you're going to see. Yeah, I just found out about her a couple months ago. Never met your sister? No. Wow. So I'm going out to Seattle to meet her. I'm looking forward... Maybe she turns out to look like Angelina Jolie. Shit, if she do, I hope she ain't my sister. Hey, man, what you want on your cake, man? You never told me. I got to send you one, man. I don't want no cake, Eddie. Damn it, Jack, come on, man... Hey, I can't think of anything that has happened in my life that I would want written on a cake. Nothing? I'm not a good guy, Eddie. I'm not a good guy. Yeah, me neither. Diane. Frank. Give me the keys. Stay in the car. A little out of your sector, aren't you? Saving lives knows no bounds. You should know that, Frank. You look good. You look a little desperate, Frank-- it doesn't suit you. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door. Sorry, Jack, this is the closest I can get you. Like I said, you're looking good. Hey, come on, let's go. No, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute. Why are we stopping? We're on Fourth. This is as far as you go, too. Aw, come on, man. Listen to me, Eddie. What? Listen. Those guys you were going to testify against... those cops... Yeah? I was one of them. You were going to testify against me, too. I did what they did. We did some bad things. I did another bad thing when I used you. I was going to let you do what I should've done... what I should've had the courage to do six year ago. I'm sorry. You know, if you didn't, uh, come and get me today... I'd be dead right now. Right. So... I was supposed to meet you. That was the sign. You saved my life, kid. Take care of yourself, kid. Thank you. Make cakes, Eddie the baker. Oh, yeah. You give the car keys to your best friend and you let him take the old lady to the hospital. You stay at the bus stop with the girl, because she's the girl of your dreams, right? So everything's going to be okay. Right? Yeah. Have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister. Yeah. Yeah. Get him down to the Port Authority. Make sure he gets on that bus, all right? Yeah. Carl, thanks. No problem. All right. Hell of a morning, huh? Where's the wit? You're looking at him. I let the kid go, Frank. You're not going to get to him now. Bullshit. Wouldn't do that. So, uh... what do you think you're going to tell them? Hmm? Are you going to tell them everything? Are you going to tell them about you, too? You think that's going to make you feel better? Nothing's going to make me feel better. Then why? Look, Jack, you and me... we... did our business... in a certain way. You never complained when we cleared the tough cases. It didn't bother you doing any of that until... Listen to me, all right? You listen, all right, Jack? Really listen. Whatever you think that you are going to do up there... it is never going to happen. You are not going to make it. Is that what you think, Frank? You're going to shoot me down here; nobody knows? Like the Ling family, huh? Like they never knew. He was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut. All right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth, he had a heart attack, he died. So what? So what?! Look, if it hadn't happened the way that it did, if he hadn't died, you would have been patting me on the back saying, "Good job." Collateral damage-- it is a fact of life in this business. He took his last breaths while you were wiping the fingerprints off the gun. He was gonna take down our case. He was an innocent man. He was gonna take down our case. He was somebody's husband. He was going to take down our case! He was somebody's father. He was gonna take down our case! What were we supposed to do?! If you wanted to, tell the truth. Fuck the truth! Frank... I not gonna need this anymore. Bobby, he's on his way up. Take him out. Mosley's in the building! Get the ADA! Freeze! Hands in the air! Get on your knees! Don't shoot. Don't move! I'm not armed. Get down on your knees! Don't shoot. I'm not armed. Lower your weapon. Just call ADA McDonald, please, on the radio? Get ADA McDonald down here right now! Don't shoot. Don't shoot me! Just get ADA McDonald. Jack, come on! Lower your weapon. Come on, do it, get down! Mosley! Mosley! Hands up! McDONALD: Where's my witness? Where's Edward Bunker? He didn't make it. I'm going to take his place. Please lower your weapons. Hold you fire and stand down, both of you. Back off. I have information... ...regarding your ongoing witness tampering investigation. The dates, cases that include extortion, manslaughter and possible homicide involving members of the 14th Precinct. These charges include Captain Dan Gruber, Detectives Jerry Shue, Edward Maldonado... Bob Torres... Jim Mulvey... myself... and Detective Frank Nugent. What's this about, Mosley? What do you want? I want Edward Bunker's record expunged. Done. What else? Nothing else. You can substantiate all this, Mosley? Yeah. Gun! Oh! Hold your fire. I fired that shot. ...down here; nobody knows? Like the Ling family, huh? Like they never knew. He was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut. All right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth, he had a heart attack, he died, so what? So what? Look, if it hadn't happened the way that it did, if he hadn't died, you would have been patting me on the back saying, "Good job." Collateral damage-- it is a fact of life in this business. He was gonna take down our case. He was gonna take down our case! He was gonna take down our case! What were we supposed to do?! If you wanted to, tell the truth. Fuck the truth! McDONALD: Let's get you to the jury. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Hey, happy birthday. Happy birthday, Jack. Welcome back, Jack. Two years in the pen is enough. Thanks for that, man. Thank you. Thank you. Happy birthday, Jack. Happy birthday. Welcome home. I hate birthdays. You know that, right? Sorry, sorry. Happy birthday. This came with it. Dear Jack Mosley, I hope you're doing well and everything worked out like it was supposed to. I'm doing great. Seattle is different, and I like it a lot. I-I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air before I got here. It's a trip. Sometimes I can't even believe it. It's the best feeling I've had in my life. I'm busting my ass, but I'm happy, though. The bakery is now open. Three cheers. I put my name first 'cause I'm doing all the hard work. These ovens are hot, man. Hope you like the cake. What'd I tell you? If you ever in town, you got a friend. Thank you for doing the right thing, Jack Mosley. God bless you. Keep in touch. Peace. Come on, take one more. You know how this guy... I was talking.
