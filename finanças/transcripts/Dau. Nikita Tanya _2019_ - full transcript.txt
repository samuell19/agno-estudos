Let me through Don't be afraid. Touch him when he's running Touch him when he's running You Touch him when he's running Step away so she can pet him This one? - Are you scared of him a little? - No, I'm just afraid that he... - Must be his mum - Has he got bitten? He's doing something she doesn't like so she bites him I want a chocolat bar Alright Someone left and another one came Lots of people walk here. Security guards, journalists - Institute employees - Why do they walk here? - It's an institute, people work here - What about these ones? - These people work as well - Then why do they - Hello - They walk like they Just ignore them, people work here - Are they guarding the street? - It depends. Let's turn here Who's the first one to run... Lia, let's go look for mum Yes, with Borya And we'll see who's at home Are you running to the canteen? She's gonna outrun you What? - She wants to run to the canteen - Dad, look Yes, that's great Have you eaten yet, sweetheart? Mum, Mum, hi. Where've you been? We saw the piggies, I did some shooting, and rode on a motorbike And which was your favourite? The piggies ran away from me, and from Borya too You didn't catch one? No, I got to hold one little piglet You have to grab him quickly, like this Borya, Borya, did you eat? Have you had dinner? He hasn't, no Sorry, honey, but you have to eat I just had two glasses of birch juice Borya won't eat the marrow You have to eat. And anyway, where are you going? It's late - I'm going to go for a ride and then... - Borya one lap and then we eat That's the deal. That's it Here. I need to p-p-... Pee? Hold on. Evacuation time, evacuation time - Let's run, go go - Evacuation. Evacuation Evacuation - Evacuation - If it's a poo... tell me if you want to poo Deary me. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry If the cottage cheese isn't sweet enough, add some sugar All right, I'll do it now It's very sweet We can go out at night No, we can't. Night time is for sleeping Then why did Borya want to go out? Borya got confused. He thought it was already morning We'll go out in the morning It's all right, dear Sweetheart, let's go brush our teeth Go here instead. Then, you control more of them places - THOSE places - Thanks Borya's brushed his teeth. Now it's your turn - Have one more plum and then we go - Me? - You too if you want - You've brushed your teeth though Well... Can I just rinse later? Of course. Have another plum Liya, do you want it or not? We're going No, it's plum, then brushing her teeth and that's it Then let's go, Liya I can't go over there, I'm too tired Too tired to brush your teeth? We'll help you - Let's go, honey - Brush my teeth Right here? Let's go, honey I can carry you if you want? Can Mummy brush my teeth here? I don't think she can, Liya And the glass? Mum will help you. She'll brush your teeth Come on, I'll carry you to Mummy Liya, the toothbrush is waiting for you "Where is Liya?" "Where are those little teeth?" Let her finish it. I'll take it here Honey... Mummy, I can't. I'm tired You're tired? Do you want to finish your plum, or not? Liya I'll eat it You're misbehaving. I'm taking away the plum - I'll finish it - Be quick. The tooth brush is waiting - What's this? - The queen That's a shame. All right That was silly of me That's the last time you get to take a move back Fine, thanks I'm bringing out Old Knighty No, it's fine "On the meadow a huge djinn was making a fire" "little djinns were bringing him dry brushwood" "And more and more new djinns were coming out of the wood" "young, old, black, red, hairy, tailed, with terrible fangs and glowing eyes" "When the fire flared up all djinns sat around wailing" "Oh Master, don't send the tailors to us" "have pity for our coats" "Have your coat sewn from something else" "Deliver us from the tailor with his scissors" "There was so much roaring, screeching, squealing and howling" "that the poor terrified Weaver let go of his branch" "and fell right into the middle of the djinn gathering" "The Weaver thought he was doomed, but luckily the Tailor kept his cool" "He jumped down from the tree, started clicking his scissors" "And shouted with all his might" "Grab them, hold them, bring them here" "With an awful yowl, the djinns scattered, and disappeared into the dark" "The tailor and weaver waited till morning, then hurried back home" "You see?" said the tailor, "You wanted more than you needed" "And your greed very nearly killed you" Nikita, what's bothering you? I feel that something very important is happening to me and I don't know how you'll react But I want you to be a part of this process, you know? I also want to be a part of this process Especially because working in the Institute has helped me to understand or understand something about myself, that My ideas... The ones I've had since I was young, about how everything is organised and how it should be organised are actually all unrealistic As it's happened... it's happening here I think it's very important and I'd like you to... to feel it with me What's unrealistic? For example... You know, I've always wanted to control everything in all matters in simply everything As it turns out, I live in an imaginary world inhabited not by people, but by my ideas Well In a way, it's always like that - We all live in our own worlds - I think happy people are... - Can escape - Can get through this and talk with real living people, and not with ghosts In any case, you'll always perceive others your own prism It's just a question of hearing others Yes That's... That's what I'm working on But what can I do about it? Well... You know, I think you're doing everything right You trust me and... It's not that you're ruling me with an iron rod It's me, who is like holding the rod above myself But if you say it to me then it will be a lot easier Well Just don't... I'm running off my feet too And I'm just not ready to listen to you in certain situations because I spend the day running around then rush home to look after the children and when I've put the children to bed I just collapse I'm not ready to listen to anything by that point not even my own children But... that will pass, you know At a certain point the children will grow up Yes, we just have to get through it At a certain point there'll be... I don't know... You'll no longer have so much on your plate at work I don't know, something will happen and then it will turn out that I'm a different person Yes, and that I don't know you And that you're a different person too because, you know, I'm rushed off my feet too And on my way I'm trying to to do the parenting to save the world, to... to write formulae, and to look at beautiful girls too, you know I think that on my part, in our relationship there's been for, I don't know, about the last five years the situation has been that I have kind of closed myself up from you and But at the same time I closed myself off from myself too That is, I... I tried to shove myself into a little box, into some limits into some kind of bunker where I just keep turning the same handle round and round I just do everything that needs to be done I'm completely... just... like... cutting myself with scissors from all sides and Instead of taking off I try to find axes with which I hack off a couple more of my feathers Then I suffer and wonder why I'm in such pain What is it, Nikita? For example, I understood that I can fall in love Have you fallen in love? I have But... It's not... It's... It's not what it was before What is it then? It's that... I love you I... I... I love our children But at the same time I can have some feelings for other people How do you see it? How do I see it? I don't see it, I feel it, feel it No. How do you see this situation? No. Well, it's only a theoretical situation It... it's not... the thing... How can I put it? There isn't a specific Nothing's going on, it's just... No, Nikita, we're all human - I can fall in love too - You can fall in love too It's just... what do we do next? I'm not trying to say that I need to have sex on the side, or something like that That's not what I'm talking about What I want to say is that I want to feel that I'm a free... a responsible and free person - How does that work? - I don't know Any second now we'll hear the "Mu-u-um" You know, someone's already running around up there We're not going to get any sleep now Let's call up the nanny Though we still won't get any sleep I... What? Tell me - It doesn't matter - Tell me, tell me It's just, you know I... I won't... I won't be able to be new and different for my whole life You don't need to be, I love you just as you The way you were when I fell in love with you You don't change for me That's not true, Nikita, it's just an illusion, can't you see? It's just that once again you're afraid of seeing things the way they really are No, that's not what it's about It is about that too, it is... I don't know... I'm too tired to think Shall I help you? What? Stop. You'll tear it again It's like with Borya, I ask him not to lie because otherwise I'll never believe him in the future It's one and the same, how can you trust someone who tells lies? But you mustn't say that There are very few people who don't lie - I don't lie - Well, I do And because I myself don't lie I always believe other people Why doesn't it ever occur to me that people can lie? I've told you hundreds of times that I believe what people say to me I was just afraid to tell you Also, it would be nice to know that this isn't the last time you'll tell me things and that I'm not going to be taken by surprise whenever I go somewhere And then you're surprised that I'm not cheerful Have you got a handkerchief, Nikita? I'll have a look Nikita, you know, I know that you're like that And there's no need to... I guess if it's not there... ...you don't get passionate about anything I just knew it all already Tanya, you mean, you'd rather admit that I'm like that in theory but not know the details? Borya's awake I think the thing is that I've just grown up a bit And managed to put it into words I'm up already, I've been lying there for hours - I can't keep my eyes shut - What's the matter? I don't know, I just... I can't do it I already slept for a bit But I'm all awake now You can go and play quietly if you like Why have you got dressed, Borya? It's still very early Go and lie down a bit longer and you'll drop off It was the same yesterday Can I go downstairs? Yes, go down, just don't wake Lia up Are you expecting me to say to you "Go on then, introduce me to her" - Are you? - No, Tanya, I'm not If I say to you "Go on, introduce me to her, Nikita" If you say that, then... You'll organize a little party Right? Yeah, that might not be such a bad idea It could even be fun What if I were to tell you that? That you'd fallen in love? What would you be like? I don't know, I can't say before it happens - Well, should I tell you? - Go on then - That I've fallen in love? - Yes. Definitely I can't tell you before it happens either No, I'm only asking you to tell me what you feel when you feel something - Now, I feel bad - I understand - I want to feel sorry for you - Don't feel sorry for me Well, not "sorry" but give you a cuddle Well that's how you should act in life then as if I'm... a pet dog or something who you have to feel sorry for and stroke Don't mistake love and pity for one another If you could go back and do it again, what would you have done? Or what would you want to do? Tanya, due to the fact that I went through all that I understood something about myself after that If I'd started from the point I was at back then - Yes, now - then I wouldn't be in that situation Where would you be? What would have happened? I wouldn't have paid any attention to those girls - Why? - Because they were completely irrelevant Whom would you have paid attention to? It's nothing to do with falling in love. You see? Yes, I understand, you fell in love You had a sense of duty, you were overwhelmed by emotions - All in one go - And out of the blue a stranger turned up in the heat of the moment If everything had been how you'd wanted, how would it have been? Your emotions would have overwhelmed you whatever you don't control whether you fall in love or not, what can you do? You know, the only thing that makes your whole life experience valuable is that it lets you do things in the future, not in the past Or perhaps it's not at all valuable History teaches that it teaches us nothing You simply found out that you are able to do something like that No, just that I can't control myself Did that surprise you? Yes Because I found out that I can't control myself in situations in which I understand, or so I thought all the boundaries and limitations and all the circumstances It even turned out that I can't even control myself in a situation like that What help have limitations and boundaries ever been to anyone? Boundaries and limitations are put in place to provoke people Not to stop them No one ever anywhere has ever been helped in any way by boundaries and limitations They helped me - How? - They helped me realise that I can't be stopped by any boundaries or limitations I shouldn't have said anything What does "should" or "shouldn't" even mean? You're just saying what you feel I'm asking you to say what you feel Don't pick what you should and shouldn't say It's me who gives the wrong answers to all the questions You know where I get my sense of should and shouldn't from? I've already told you that I'm an absolute egoist I know what I should and shouldn't do Very well... then that's your choice I accept it What else could you do? Where could I go to get away from you? Go on, downstairs Dad... Dad Take this Go on, go downstairs Please Have you been up for long? - Borya? - Yep For an hour - Did you hear what we were talking about? - What? Did you hear our conversation? Yep Do you have any thoughts about it? - What do you mean? - Doesn't matter Borya, I'm hungry. Do you want to come to the office with me? - Have you finished your chicken? - I've already had some - Shall I finish it for you? - Nah - Are you going to finish it or not? - Nah - You're not going to finish it? - Nope I'll finish it off then A quick game - A quick game, go on then - Look... No, no, look Your horses got there quick Like Red Army men Ah, no, it's not check... It's not checkmate Not yet? That's good Yeah, they did get there quick Why is it always you? I also want to play You've been playing with it on the way here No, not all the time Borya, please sit down on the bench - Lia, let's go sit on the bench - No, no You see, there is a car coming. You can't jump the rope here - With Borya? Sit down - No, with Borya - Shall we keep on walking? - It's up to you I'll go I will go further without you - Will you go further with me? - If you like All right. Do you want your jumping rope? - As you like - Alright then You will have to catch the ball with the jumping rope - Alright then - Run and catch it and give it back to me - Try not to hit the car - I'll also try to catch it - Why is mum not coming back? - I don't know, she's busy with her things Lia, let's go Let's go Borya, you're waiting for Mama, right? I'd rather you waited with us Come It's really good Just don't put them on the chessboard - Why not? - Because I'm still playing with it It's "chessBOARD", not "CHESSboard" - CHESSboard? - CHESSboard - You're embarrassing me - This paper will be my board Lia, dear, where shall I put your plate? EMployee of the month, or employEE of the month? Right - Where do I put your plate? Next to Daddy? - Can I put it on the paper? I would be so happy if you sat next to me I want it on the paper What do you want on paper, honey? To play chess without Borya I'm giving you a napkin, on which you're going to eat And I'm giving you... a newspaper No, a whole magazine for you to play on I can't put you there, next to such a big cake. Your mother needs that Are you sure you don't want some chicken first? Yes, absolutely I thought I'd brought more forks. Here Your chess pieces can go here. Did I not bring the forks? - Where did I put them? - How should I serve the chicken? - One plate would be fine - Sure - One, two, three, four... - You found them? Thank you so much Would you like some juice or water? What kind of juice is there? - Apple - I don't want it - You'll have water, Lia? - I want apple juice Borya, take your glass, please, and one for Daddy Thanks - and one for Mummy - Thanks That should do I'm playing against myself, Lia, so could you... These red ones And the white ones, you can give them all to me Here Thank you Just don't make me another sandwich Liya, dear Since you're the youngest, you get first pick - We'll quickly eat up the rest - The one with the skin - Do you want the skin? - Just the skin - Let me... - No, just the skin Honey, you can't eat just the skin It won't fill you up Here's some more skin with a little bone Can you manage it? Liya, sweetie, I've given you a fork - Mate - Well done Congratulations With the king again? - No - With the queen? Thank you, Anya dear I couldn't have taken in anyway because there was a rook How much chicken do you want, darling? I'll say when I think... now just a little piece, please - This one? - Yes, that's it And that one as well Nikita I'll have cottage cheese Daddy, will you fire the cannon with us? - Tanya, take some - No... bread and cheese will do me Thanks - Thank you - Till next time Bye Well, did you find a strong move? A strong move? Well... At any rate, I'll take a pawn - No, that's not the strongest move - I know Then make a strong move - What? - Then make a strong move I don't know what would be a strong move How do I recognise it? Consider your possibilities Right. First possibility, the rook takes me Second, the queen takes me Third, the knight takes me Fourth, the knight... This is... hopeless Why is it hopeless? Whom does the knight threaten if he takes that pawn? Well, the king So what if he does? I'll be in check So what? That's not where your strength lies You're threatening rook, king and queen at the same time I can't protect all of them It's called a "fork". It's a very strong move I either lose the game or lose the queen There lived two fellows You're doing ever so well, sweetheart Where did we stop? Right there This is where I started Yes, but you reached the full stop Two fel-lows. Full stop There lived two fellows Full stop - O - Good girl On.. on... On... on... Ong. What's that last letter? O. N... On One... Ones... One... One it says... Si... Sa... Sa. Sa-n... San - Borya beat me, you know - He told me. Did you let him win? I can't believe it Of course, I overlooked a lot of things - But no, I never gave in deliberately - I forgot the plate I never held back I'm so glad He was so happy - Can you move this? - It's great Borya's so into chess - And many other things as well - Your napkin... He's grown up so suddenly. He said "Mummy dearest" - "Mummy dearest"? - Yes He said to me, "darling father, you're not going anywhere" Something like that No, that's not how he said it Liya's something else She wouldn't leave the pigsty But she couldn't grab one of the little pigs either - Maybe she was scared? - No, even I couldn't catch one No, they're just too agile. But she wouldn't leave They must be charming in some way whatever is might be I'm getting tongue-tied, that's how knackered I am The thing is... It's always like that with us We get so tired we can't even talk And this fatigue happens on such levels that it makes it impossible to talk about the things you want, because... You come home from work the kids are all over you, you put them to bed There you go I want to tell you that I've fallen in love with a woman who doesn't reciprocate It's hurting me and I want to share this with you First off, it's ridiculous that I want to share it with you, but I do And secondly... She doesn't feel the same? No What if she did feel the same? Or say, in five years I meet someone who does? Or tomorrow I'd like to know... I don't want it to keep secrets from you I don't think you know me, really because I don't think you know what I'm capable of Such as? Well, for example... to get drunk and hit on a girl I don't care for then reach the point where you need to fuck realise that I don't have any feelings for her and to just leave And leave her with her feelings hurt Just to get out of bed saying "I don't love you" "I love some other girl" This has happened to me And what do you want from me? I want you to know that I'm capable of that and some And what is it that you want? I want to have an opportunity... I don't know say to rent the house next door and have the girl I like move in there and go live there three days a week Nikita, I won't live like that I simply won't So that is the line you won't cross? I'm not saying that not talking about uncrossable lines I just don't want it - I don't want it - And at that moment your love will end? It's not a question of my love. It's a question of my choice It's a question of what I want for myself. It's not about you, me or the kids I mean, it IS about me And I don't want it. It won't work for me - What would work for you? - In that scenario you just leave If you love somebody that much - you go I don't want you going back and forth I don't want to because I couldn't live like that I don't think I could live like that What if I rent a house and move the man I love in there? We rent two houses next door. One for you and one for me I... I don't know how to play the victim, Nikita Could it be accepting me, rather than playing a victim? Yes, if you did the same for me - So I rent another house? - But hold on If that's what you wish, of course Because in this particular scenario, I'll need to prove to myself that I, too, can turn elsewhere emotionally Why does it have to be such a battle? Because it hurts me, because I have feelings for you And for you to just go away somewhere, to me it's... It's hard for me It's hard that you come temporarily If you need to go, go, I won't hold you You need to, you go, that's all But for you to live next door, no thanks If you need to go, then go But I love you And I don't want to go And I can't live in two houses, Nikita So I have to bring a girl to our house? You can. Then I will go So what do we do? So if I went to work - and went to my lover without telling you - No it would be a less painful option? No, Nikita, we have tried it and it didn't work It's straightforward You are not capable of living for two women You can fall for someone but that's... You know, the excitement lasts while... while it's still an infatuation As soon it becomes an issue of changing your family you will have to resolve it anyway I don't really believe that you can love two people You can be infatuated with one and love another The option of being infatuated with me is in the past, you see? I don't know, Nikita. I mean... I think this situation is possible I just can't tell you in advance that yes, this is how it will be Do you see? Do you want to know why? I'll tell you. Because... Right now, and for the last couple of years or just under... I've had an absolute priority in my life, which is my two children Ten years from now, they'll become independent from you. Maybe fifteen... No, even in a few years I'll have a far greater degree of freedom But given that at this stage, you and I have different priorities - Our situation is not equal - No That's why I can't tell you in advance with my acute sense of equality and brotherhood how long... my patience will last You see, I won't... I won't get in your way I won't help you I'd very much like us to be able to talk about it But I can't promise you what my feelings will be At least while I love you I do need to have that wave of having a new woman in my life No, Nikita, dear. You need it When your life isn't exhausting otherwise While it's overwhelming you... Like when Borya was little, all those sleepless nights Like me not having a job, waiting for you at home If I quit my job now, stay at home, take full care of you not be as the exhausted mum I am, you wouldn't need that wave for some time at least. And if at the same time we move if our house starts falling apart or if mum or dad gets sick you won't need it You just have a certain pot that needs to be filled to the top and if it's not full you'll fill it with something Of course it's best to fill it with something pleasant Tanya, everyday chaos is not enough for me neither is caring for sick parents or with career or what-have-you Nikita, in that sense maybe I'm just not quite right for you If it were another woman, maybe she could fill you I don't think so. I think you are the only one who's right for me Because you're the only one who tries to understand me You say you're selfish but you're not You're always looking outwards, as I see it - And not inwards - I do that for myself For myself I live with you so I try to understand you But the fact that you live with me and not some Vasya, Petya or Maxim is that pure coincidence? That I don't know - But none of it matters anyway - What do you mean? You're hugely exaggerating Don't you think I'm showing a side you weren't aware of? No, I don't No, I don't. That you can get drunk? I already knew. That you... you need to fall in love? I already knew. What's the big deal? Well, you know I know that I'm capable of crazy things in a drunken state You're trying to buy an indulgence from me I'm not. I'm trying to figure out the limits of your love I can say anything you want right now - But I don't know how I'll feel then - Just imagine But Nikita If you're drunk... I've told you a hundred times not to speed where we live Because there are little kids around I think you're a crazy driver. But what am I supposed to do? - I don't drive like I'm crazy anymore - Yes, you do I had a conversation about it with the neighbour - It's just that the car is loud - That's not the problem That you are... kind and gentle and a basically honest man? I already knew that And that's why your lies are killing me Your lies are indirect, they're all by omission. You lie to yourself when it suits you And one time it really devastated me and offended me for life When? In the situation with Liya When I said that you made me come back because you got pregnant? Yes That was low of me It wasn't about being low. You were dishonest, you were lying But I don't want to discuss it now - Why? Let's talk about - I told you, I don't want to That's it, end of discussion I think that's one of those cases when it's clearly unfair It's unfair to me, because I've never been dishonest with you And never tried to trick you And that time wasn't a trick either. I was totally honest with you I told you everything beforehand which day it was and what would happen It's not like I was forcing aphrodisiacs down your throat So you don't get to tell me that I was dishonest with you. You were the dishonest one You were dishonest and unmanly for not taking responsibility For not saying to yourself "yes, that's how it was" You know why? Because you... Because in another woman's eyes you didn't look as honest and responsible a man as you wanted to be You know, Nikita even emotionally I've put a lot of effort into being able to survive certain things Certain things being my adultery? Just your leaving You know, I've gone through all of it And I knew that if you left, my life wouldn't end there It's very hard and very painful, but my life is way beyond you leaving More than that, I know I will survive it without falling apart Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to live with you at all Because I know you, or I think I do And I don't need those half-truths from you when you say that you're going somewhere and it's not true Don't say that, because every time I believe you Every time I hope that we've passed that stage where you had to say just a bit of truth Because the most painful thing is to realise that I'm not your closest person, but people around you are They know more about you That's what really hurts Shall we go for a walk? - We actually don't argue often, you know - Very rarely What is it with this thing? That was just... It's like Liya said today - "you're guarding me, right?" D2, Nekrasov, good evening, why I can't get through to you? - How do these things work? - D2. Nekrasov We need someone who can watch the kids while we go out Thank you This might wake the kids That? No, if they're asleep, they'll be fine Thank you They're sleeping like angels. Sniffling a little A simply idyllic scene Liya hasn't even done her ninety-degree turn Remember, we got married because we wanted each other's child? So there's no question that we both wanted Borya It was... well, you could say our first joint project - That formula of yours came together too - Yes For the first time While in Liya's case From my side everything was horribly twisted Of course I wanted the baby and you and I had tried before But at the point when... when we'd made Liya for me it was more of... I'd call it a return ticket, you know? I was leaving, but I knew I'd be back, because I was making her just then And there I was justifying myself by thinking that you were using your tears to... Nikita, that wasn't true It wasn't true - It wasn't true about my tears - That's how I wanted to see it then It wasn't true - It's true that there were tears - Of course there were tears, but - They were about something else - I asked you at the time Yes, you did. And I just followed the path of least resistance, and said yes, we were making a baby The main thing is that she's such a marvel Yes, that she turned out to be a joy and I have no idea what I did to deserve her The result so completely fails to match the circumstances - And that's when a new formula appeared - Yes, a little later In the process And Borya... He's so good, and he wants to be better and to push Lia too - It gets to the point of ridiculousness - He really is But at the same time, he's trying to stay ahead of her - Yes. But he is exactly like you, Nikita - He is - Nikita... I love you - I love you too What made you fall in love? What was the catalyst? That was different with each woman With some it was a feeling With one girl I fell in love because everything was so light and easy and beautiful - You mean her? - Yes Therefore I thought it would all be safe Because it seemed unlikely to get serious The other was the opposite. It took much longer Time is very relative... because She's a very serious and thoughtful person I mean she's very impressive These are my impressions of them Let's sit down for a while - Do they know you love someone else? - One of them does.
