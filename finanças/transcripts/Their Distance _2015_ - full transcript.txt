Their Distance Got more here. All right. Here you are. - Good work today. - You too. - Good work today. - Good work. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. - Hello. - Good morning. - Hey, good morning. - I'm taking my break now. - All right. Leon dreamed of that moment again. Two years ago Leon ran a red light on his bicycle. Distracted, another man followed him across and was hit by a car. Leon met the man's girlfriend when he was questioned. But the girlfriend never blamed Leon. Leon was only officially declared a witness to the accident. Saturday, April 4th You can see me? What? You can see me. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? You do something bad? No, not really. Leon, how's it going? You think you can do this too? Mine's going to take some time to do. Yes. No problem. Sorry. It needs to be done by Monday afternoon. - Thanks. - Okay. "Nam Sangsoo." "Nam Sangsoo." Nam Sangsoo Sunday, April 5th - Good morning. - Good morning. - Thank you. - Thank you. Excuse me. Good work today. You too. Monday, April 6th Oh, good morning. Hello. Hello. Excuse me. How can I help you? Here's my order ticket. Let me have a look. - One moment, please. - Okay. Leon. Is this your order? Thanks. Thank you for waiting. - Are these the right pair? - Yes. Please make sure. Yes, they look fine. Good work today. - Good work. - Good night. Tuesday, April 7th Wednesday, April 8th Thursday, April 9th Welcome. Hello. How can I help you? Could you read this please? What? You can give me your answer anytime. - What? - Yes. I like you. I love you. Goodbye. Is that a love letter? What's it say? Good morning. Hey, morning. She got a love letter. - Good work today. - See you tomorrow. Friday, April 10th Saturday, April 11th Thursday, April 2nd Ms. Kanako. Ms. Kanako? Oh, I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Thanks. You don't look well. Ms. Kanako. ...like you, Ms. Kanako. What? I hate to see you unhappy. Please tell me if there's anything that I could do to help. Thank you. But I'm sorry, I already have a boyfriend. Okay. But I have a girlfriend too. It's okay. But... ...I still like you. Thank you. You like me, but... ...Kanako too? Friday, April 3rd Yeah, Ms. Kanako. You're starting to have feelings for this Ms. Kanako too? Is that what you're saying? I guess I already like her. What are you talking about? What? I've never felt this way before. So I'm having a hard time understanding myself. But I like both of you. I know this isn't easy to understand. What? Are you stupid? Yeah, maybe I am. But I thought it wouldn't be fair not to tell you how I felt. So? What do you want to do? You want to break up with me? I don't know. I'm really confused. Yeah, you're not the only one. I don't know what I should do. Maybe this is just temporary. But I just wanted you to know what was going on inside my head. Sangsoo. Can you see me? Yeah, I can. Really? Good. I thought... ...I didn't exist anymore. Can you see me? What? Saturday, April 4th Excuse me. Would you like to use a basket? Oh, no, thank you. Oh, but... Do you wash those? What? The basket. I asked if you wash them. No, we don't. No, we don't wash them. Then no, thank you. They're dirty. Okay, I understand. Would you like a different one? No, thank you. Hello. Hi. I had a terrible day. What happened? Hey, what happened? I broke a heel. What? I was sleeping in a park... ...and then I broke a heel. You slept in a park after that? I could take those shoes in to get repaired if you want. What? There's a place on my way to work that repairs and makes custom shoes. - Really? - Yeah. Nice, that would be great. I'll pay you back later. All right. You're a nice guy, Sangsoo. Am I? Welcome. I'd like to get these heels fixed. Okay, very good. I see. All right, one moment, please. Since tomorrow's Sunday... ...we won't be able to get them back to you until sometime after 1 p.m. on Monday. Yes, that's fine. Okay, then. I'll need your name... ...and phone number... ...and your address, please. Okay. Are you from Korea? Yes, I am. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry. I can't really write that well yet. Do I have to fill this out to get the shoes repaired? If you'd like, I could fill it out for you. Oh, thank you. I'd appreciate that. Okay, I'll take care of this for you. - "You eat it with soy sauce." - "You eat it with soy sauce." - "You eat it without soy sauce." - "You eat it without soy sauce." - Okay? - Yes. All right, that's all for today. Sunday, April 5th What is it, Sangsoo? Would it be okay if I asked you something? What is it? This. "The other day when I met you to get the heel repaired..." "...I fell for you as soon as I heard..." "Annyeong haseyo." What does that mean? Basically, "I love you." There's no way it's that short. I guess he experienced love at first sight. Oh, that's nice. - Yeah. - Yeah. Have you experienced it? Love at first sight? No. Have you? I guess not. Right? You normally don't. Oh, well, it's not love at first sight... ...but maybe something like that happened the day of my accident. - Leon? - Oh yeah, Leon. I can't believe you remember. I guess you don't forget someone that handsome. I guess you don't. Yeah. - He had quite a pretty face. - Yeah. I was lost staring at him right before I got hit. - Well, can't blame you there. - No. But I'm really glad for the accident. I'm not sure where you were headed. Wait, you still want to bring that up? I already apologized for that. I think I've been punished enough. Well, if you're getting punished, don't get others involved. Why did I get stuck looking after you... ...even after you cheated on me? I'm really sorry about that. Sorry. I don't really think that. Hey. Maybe... Maybe breaking up would be for the best. Why? Maybe your parents are right. I thought it'd be good to really think about... ...what would make you happy. You know, what your dad said... ...about it being fine for now, but maybe not the future. I mean, how do I put this? I thought it might be the wheelchair that you're still with me. How do you really feel? About what? Well, if... If my legs weren't like this... ...would you really still be with me? I just can't help thinking that. You know. Like maybe I'm just tying you down because of these legs. I end up thinking. It might sound like I'm saying this for your sake... ...but there's also a part of me I hate that I think this way. Wednesday, April 8th - Is she...? - Yes? Do you know if she has a boyfriend or not? No, I don't know. I see. But that doesn't matter. "I fell for you as soon as you said Annyeong haseyo and smiled." Ms. Kanako, please! - "I fell for you..." - Ms. Kanako! "I fell for you." "When I met you..." Please stop, Ms. Kanako! Thursday, April 9th - Hey, did you break up with Suna? - What? Why? He says he saw something. What? What does that mean? Suna was just hanging around a park. I was just kind of worried. So did you break up or what? We didn't break up. Really? All right. Later, then. See you. Thank you very much. Hey. Yeah? Are you free tonight? Tonight? Yeah, I'm free. I wanted to talk to you about something. - Is it about Jiwoo? - Not really, I guess. I'll tell you tonight. Welcome. "I fell for you." His handwriting is cute. The other day... ...I told my girlfriend that there was another girl I had feelings for. What? What did your girlfriend say to that? She asked me if I was stupid. Well, that's pretty stupid. Yeah, it's pretty stupid. And? - What? - Did you break up? No. We haven't broken up yet. - I see. - Yes. But that's not really fair, is it? It's not fair to her if you don't choose. Are you staying together or breaking up? You have to make a decision. I mean, she's not even allowed to find someone else to love at this point. So... ...there's actually been someone I've been thinking about. What? And it's not Jiwoo? I'm awful. I told Jiwoo how I didn't get it at all... ...and here I am thinking about someone else already. Who is it? Anybody I know? No. Nobody you know. Actually... ...I don't know him too well either. What? And you just fell for him? I mean, it's pretty crazy, right? We barely even had a conversation. But I just keep thinking about him... ...for some reason. I see. Remember when... ...was drunk and broke my heel? Yeah. He was there when I woke up. The guy was. In the park? I mean, not just in the park, he was right in front of me. I think he was worried about me. But I was so drunk... ...I don't remember which park it was. I have a feeling that I'll never even see him again. But still... You like him. I actually went around and checked on three or four parks before work today. I see. Jiwoo doesn't know about this yet, does he? But I think I should tell him. I see. I hope you see him again. But I wonder. Maybe when I meet him he'll turn out to be a real scumbag. But I bet he lives somewhere around. Yeah. Oh, by the way. I should really thank you, Suna. Thank me? I've actually fallen for someone too. Really? And... ...it was love at first sight. Seriously? Well. Cheers. I had a fight with my boyfriend too. What? My boyfriend has problems with his legs. He's in a wheelchair. So my parents are against us getting married. And then my boyfriend told me... ...that maybe we shouldn't get married... ...thinking it wouldn't be best for me. He said that I can speak Korean. And that I wanted to study abroad. So that staying with him bound to this wheelchair... ...he told me it might not be what I'm supposed to be doing. What do you think? You like me, don't you, Jiwoo? What do you think I should do? I think you should get angry. I think you should be angry. I don't think anybody's really thinking what's best for you. I think there's something wrong with your boyfriend and your parents. They don't want you to do what you want. I mean, you want to get married, don't you? You want to be with him, don't you? I want you to be happy. What will make you happy? Don't act like you know everything. It's not that easy. Suna. We're here. Thanks. Are you really okay? Why do you drink this much? Because... ...I thought that maybe if I was drunk, I'd meet him again. You all right? Suna. You shouldn't be doing this. Sorry. Are you okay? Do you want to sit and talk? No, I'm fine. Thanks. All right. Well, I'm going home, then. Bye. Monday, April 13th - Hello. - Hello. Are you free tonight? Yes, of course. Here you go. All right. So about my answer. Yes. I'm sorry. My answer is no. Oh, I see. I'm sorry. Is it because I'm not Japanese? No, nothing like that. I have someone I like too. Oh, I see. He's actually Korean too. What, really? So I guess the issue was me. I guess so. Sorry. I hope it goes well with him. I doubt it will. Why's that? He has someone else he likes too. Oh, really? I work with him at the shoe shop. But it seems like something happened to him in his past. It seems to me he feels like... ...he's not allowed to have fun or be happy or something. So he's always eating lunch alone. And I thought he didn't even like anybody. That's how much he seems like he's living alone. But I noticed he's been acting differently. So I followed him. I saw him start walking to a certain apartment... ...and make sure a woman got home safely. And then he would walk back home to his apartment. - He does that every day? - Every day. Oh, but I guess all I know is that he's been doing it the last week. How do you know he's been doing that? How? Because I followed him every day. What? Well. It's a little scary. Really? But I like him. And actually, the day you gave me your love letter... ...was the only day I didn't follow him. I compared what I was doing... ...with the love letter right in front of me. But I did still like him. So I started following him again the next day. And since that day... ...he started going straight home. So... ...something definitely must've happened the day you gave me your love letter. What is that woman like? What is she like? You want to see her? Is this it? Oh, she's here. That's her. Her? It's over once she turns her light on. That's when he goes back home to his place. Well, I guess we should go too. Okay. What is it? It was the day I handed you the love letter? Yes. Something must have happened here that day. What is it? Do you know something? That was me. What? What was? It's a misunderstanding. It was a kiss. What? Kiss. Could you be specific? I think he saw me and her kiss here that night. What? It's the day you told me you liked me? Yes. Wait, hold on. Why are you kissing some other girl the day you said you liked me? It's a long story. What do you mean? Hold on. - Care to explain? - Calm down. I'll explain everything. So this Suna? She hasn't found the park she met the person she likes? No. Is she not even looking for it? Yes, it seems like she's been looking for it. She's your friend, right? You didn't think to help her look for it? No, I didn't. I had my own things to worry about. What do you mean? What were you doing? Well, I was waiting for your answer. I was nervous the whole time. Well, you can help look now. Since you got rejected. That's a pretty mean thing to say. Okay, let the three of us look for that park together, then. And if we find that guy... ...she might get rejected and give up too. Why assume she'd get rejected? Because Leon can't be happy if she didn't. I don't understand this very well. I mean, since it's not possible for everyone to be happy... ...then don't you think we should work hard... ...So either you're happy or the people you love are happy? - You think so? - Of course. Actually, why were you kissing Suna? I didn't kiss her. She kissed me. You're still bringing that up? You like to dwell on things, don't you? Is that really what you want, Ms. Kokaze? Thursday, April 16th What do you mean? Are you really okay with this Leon guy to be happy? What? I mean... ...what else am I going to do? Leon has someone he likes more than me already. Why don't you tell him how you feel? What? That'll only trouble him. Just telling them how you feel isn't always the right thing to do. I'm sorry. For telling you I liked you. Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. Hey. This is Suna. My friend from work. Nice to meet you, I'm Suna. And this is Ms. Kokaze. The girl I gave the love letter to and turned me down. - I'm Kokaze. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. And this isn't it, is it? It's not. What about here? Nope. Here? Nope. Here? No. And here? No. Maybe it was a dream. Dream? I mean, we've looked this much and still nothing. Maybe I just dreamed everything. I mean, what am I even doing? Even if we find the park, it's not like he's going to show up. It's for love. Love? What are you talking about? About dreams and love, I guess. Dreams and love? Maybe I'm avoiding it. What? Nothing. Never mind. Where are you? Come out! Don't you have school today? I do, but I'm not going. You don't want to see Ms. Kanako? No. Not today. Why? You can go if you want. You're weird. You aren't drinking today? I'm scared to drink. I got drunk the other day... ...and Sangsoo walked me home. What? Really? We sat and talked a while on the stairs. I don't remember much, though. You should be careful. Don't look at me like that. So. What did you want to tell me? Well... I've met somebody else. So... ...I think we should break up. What? Say something. Okay. Hey. Are you okay? Hey. I'm sorry. I should have taken responsibility and ended it. I'm really sorry. It's fine. Sorry. Don't be all nice now. I still have feelings for you, Jiwoo. I care about you too. That's why this is hard and so confusing. I know it was terrible... ...but I wouldn't have told you about Ms. Kanako if I didn't care about you. I would've just broken up with you. I'm sorry that I still have feelings for you. It's too late. Is he... ...someone I know? If there's anything I can do for you, just tell me, okay? Well, then... ...I want you to help me look. What? The guy I like. Hey. You know how you told me how you felt the other day? Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. You know, don't worry about it. I thought I should share with you everything I've been feeling too. Would you mind? You know... ...no matter what anybody says... ...I want to marry you. But if you don't want to get married... ...then I'm fine if we ended things now too. You know... ...when you said that maybe breaking up would be for the best... ...it really pissed me off. Like that's all this is? I'm sorry about that. I didn't know how to express it. I know I mentioned this before... ...but I felt like I was taking away your opportunities. That's all. So I'm okay if you'd rather keep things the way they are now... ...without getting married or anything. If that's what you want. It's just... ...when things get hard for you... ...I just wanted to give you a clean escape. That's what I'm talking about. You don't get anything. What do you mean? I love you. I'm the one thinking that you wouldn't be with me if you weren't in the wheelchair. I'm the one. So sometimes I do feel happy you had the accident. I'm terrible, right? It's not because... ...it kept you from going to the woman's place you were cheating on me with. I'm insecure. Do you get that? It's got nothing to do with your legs. You've got the power here. Do you get that? I know... I know that I'm the one tying you down. I know that I love you more than you love me. You know... ...the way you blame your legs... ...it's not fair. You don't love me, do you? We can end things whenever you want to. Just marry me. We don't have to, if you don't want to. Just be with me at least. So... ...don't say stuff like maybe breaking up would be for the best. If that's how you feel... ...just take responsibility and dump me. Okay. Then... ...let's get married. "Then"? I mean, I didn't mean it like that. Like what? What do you mean "then"? I mean, it just came out like that. There's nothing to read into it. Let's get married. You don't have to force yourself. Then let's quit. We can't make it. - No. - No, it's too late. We're finished. We can't make it. Damn it! - This is what I'm talking about. - What? Are you sure? Then... ...let's go see your parents again. "Then?" What? Come on. That was fine. That wasn't a wrong use, right? No? Then... Damn it, I can't stop saying it. Oh, so... ...your next birthday present. Birthday? I wanted to run something by you. What do you think about this? The ones you have now are pretty worn, right? And you need to walk for the two of us now. Okay. I'll walk for us. Monday, April 20th It looks pretty tight in there. I'll go kill some time. Oh, okay. See you soon. Excuse me. - Welcome. - I'd like to order custom-made shoes. Okay. Please take a seat. Okay. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. No problem. Thank you very much. Okay, we'll measure your feet now. Please take a seat on the sofa back here. - Leon, can you take this. - No problem. Thanks. Aren't you Leon? Yes. I'm Leon. From the accident? Oh, so you work here? Yes. We're going to get married. I mean... ...it's still up to our parents right now. Please use this basket if you'd like. - No, thank you. - Please. I made sure to wash it. What? - Really? - Yes. Here? You know, this isn't what I wanted you to do. What? I don't want you to help me find him. But you asked me to look with you. You're always doing the wrong nice thing. I don't want to be doing this either. Why would you say that now? Idiot! You idiot! Let's not do this anymore. It's painful for me too. Whatever. Idiot. I'm so sorry. I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? It's all because I'm the one who ran the red light. Hey, Arakawa ran it too. I'm so happy to hear you're happy. Please have this as well if you'd like. What? Please. So... ...we decided to stay together. What? Really? Sorry about everything. Are you sure? Well, if it's fine with you, it's fine with me. To be honest... ...I don't know how Jiwoo feels... ...but I like him. Look, I care about you too. I said from the beginning I had feelings for both of you. What? You seriously okay with this guy? Maybe we should break up. Come on. Now, get out of here. We need to get to work. What? You're the one who asked me to walk you to work. I think you should go. What? Why do you drink this much? Because... ...I thought that maybe if I was drunk, I'd meet him again. You all right? Suna. You shouldn't be doing this. Sorry. Are you okay? Do you want to sit and talk? No, I'm fine. Thanks. All right. Well, I'm going home, then. Bye. Are you okay? Sangsoo. You know... ...I don't think love at first sight works. What? I mean... ...you don't know anything about the other person. That's like... ...No good. Totally not good. Yeah, you're right. But, you know... ...I can't help it. I'm curious. So, what about the opposite? What can you find out after being together a long time? There's still a bunch of stuff you don't know... ...even after being together forever. Right? I mean, he just tells me he fell for somebody else too? Sangsoo. Sit your ass down. So, what's he like? That guy you like, I mean. Haven't I talked about him enough? So after we went drinking with Jiwoo... ...I was drunk and fell asleep in a park. And then when I woke up... ...some guy was watching me. That's the guy. Right. Hey. Sangsoo. What about you? It was love at first sight for you too, right? What's she like? The girl from the shoe shop? Who else would it be? You gave her a love letter, didn't you? What made you fall for her? She's very sunny and cheerful. It's nice when they're cheerful. That's the best, really. But the guy I like is kind of gloomy. Well... ...I'm sure he has some reason. Besides, men are way more interesting when they're... ...you know... ...carrying something with them... ...than being all cheerful all the time. Right? Am I wrong? You think so? Yeah. Well... ...if the reason why... ...he was so gloomy was because he caused an accident... ...that left someone hurt. So the reason he was gloomy... ...was because he didn't think he deserved to be happy. What would you think about that? As his reason? Sounds fine to me. Being able to think about others is a good quality. I mean... ...the world is filled... ...with people who are just thinking about themselves. Right? Maybe. But it's hard. If he still wanted to think about it or the person he hurt... ...then he should. Of course, I think he'll have to live with it. By the way... ...is the person he hurt mad? Do they forgive him? I think it depends on that too. I don't think... ...they're mad at all. But... ...he worries about it. I see. But... ...I hope something can come along and save him. I mean, I got saved by the guy... ...I met at the park somehow too. So. Do you want to see him again? Yeah, I do. Welcome. Welcome. Is that him? Seriously? Hello. The total comes out to 702 yen. That's 702 yen exactly. Thank you, please come again. Yes? Thank you for everything. What? Never mind. I'll come again. Excuse me. I brought ice creams for everyone. Thanks. What's this? Thanks. Thanks. What is this? Did something happen? Yes. I fell in love. Their Distance
