That's it! That's it! Mooseheart? That shithole town? You're better off trying to commit suicide again. It's a small town in the middle of nowhere. No one knows me there. I can get a fresh start! Oh! W-why can't I come? Let's move to Mooseheart! - Dude, let's go! - Yeah? I'll pack my white trash clothing. Alright. This is going to be sweet! I just hope nobody recognizes my name. We can get new identities when we get out there. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Plus, it seems like people have eased up on you a little bit out here lately anyway. Have a nice day, fuckers! Ugh, well, so much for that. Looks like people ain't going easy on you. Damn it, I really wanted to see the moose. No, fuck that, fuck him, and fuck my car. You know what? We're gonna hitchhike. Sweet, we can stop at those rest area bathrooms on the way. Oh man, we get to see the moose! We get to see the moose! This is gonna be cool. Can we take a smoke break please? We just stopped!

It lets drivers know what direction we're going so they know if they can help us or not. Pretty standard stuff. Yeah, but we're standing on this side of the road. I think it's pretty obvious which direction we're going. I don't think people are going to drive by and think we're not hitchhiking and assume that we're speedwalking to fucking Bolivia. It's just protocol, Joe. Oh god. Bro, we've been walking for five fucking miles, dude. Really? With the thumb? Do you really think the thumb is going to work? We went through this, Joey. No, y-you're wrong! You want to know how to get picked up? Watch this. Oh! Dude, he stopped! He stopped! I told you! Who stops for that? - Jump in, boys. - Thanks for stopping. Alright! There ya go. - Howdy. - Hey! - Zach. - Joey. Why did the Mexican throw his wife off the roof? - I dunno. - Tequila! You boys are alright. You kind souls are always risking your Rutger Hauer in "The Hitcher" situation. Movie from the '80s? Nothin? Alright, you pulled us over for a reason, Zach. Let's get this out of the way.

That's why I came to Mooseheart. I thought I could get a fresh start. I figured a town with such a morbid history might actually accept me and I was wrong. Yeah, you don't get it. You don't get it at all. This has nothing to do with your father's past. This has everything to do with you lying. And you don't lie. Not to me. Madison. You know what? I'm done.

And find out who this killer is and clear my name. Oh, this is spooky! Hey, look at me, dude. I'm Patch. He who has the weed has the power. We're supposed to be looking for clues. Relax, Sherlock Homo. The cops already came through here. Doubt you're gonna find anything that they missed. Then why are you here? Uh, to get his weed shit and from what I remember, dead people don't smoke weed that much. Oh, dude! The cops left all this shit. Bro, the fuck! New scale. Holy shit. What the fuck. The killer was wearing shoes. - Good. - Dude! What the fuck am I doing here? Shit. Joey. Candy corn. I'm good, dude. I haven't smoked yet. No, no, no. Look. There's candy corn all over the floor. Oh, shit. You think the candy corn killer's behind all these killings? Either that or it was left here to distract us. Hm. Who would wanna kill Patch? I mean, there's gotta be a rhyme, a reason, a pattern, uh. What? Okay, so the killings started right after we moved to Mooseheart. I didn't do it. Who else came to Mooseheart around the same time? I don't know. Connor Price. - Who the fuck-- - God, I knew it! Who is that? A fucking psycho. Who the fuck's Connor Price? Oh, it makes sense. Still can't figure out though how he knew about me and my dad. I mean, nobody knew about that except us. And that guy you told. Joey, what guy? Oh, it was a good looking dude I sold weed to. He said you told him everything. He had sparkly eyes. Kind of has a six pack and he's got like a nice ass. He drives fancy sports car. He's like a model looking dude. You told Connor Price about me? - About my dad? - He said he knew everything! Are you outside of your fucking mind? Joey, what was the main reason that we moved to Mooseheart? So I can put that nonsense behind me. How could you? What, you got a joke? Tell me a fucking joke. You got another fucking joke? Calm down, bro. Relax. It doesn't even matt-- Fuck! What did you do?

There'll be time for pictures and for talking. This press conference will be brief. My sole intention today is to bring attention to the string of murders that have hit our quirky little town. Thankfully, the police, they do have a key suspect. Now we cannot say the name of this person at this time though I will tell you right now. He is the son of the Bridgeport Butcher. He recently moved to Mooseheart. They also found candy corn at the scene of the murder. Yes. Uh, questions. I didn't say anything. What he asked was, will we still have the Halloween party at city hall? Well, of course it will. My goodness, the Mooseheart Halloween Bash, well it is the stuff of legends, I think we can all say that. Nobody celebrates Halloween like we do. Pictures? Tootie, take a picture. You know some people, they say that our little town is haunted. And that is has been since 1984 and the candy corn murders. Murders, which by the way, have never been solved. Is it the same person?

It's Halloween night. He's at his daddy's Halloween bash handling his work. Wait, I'm sorry. Gary's dead? Yeah, yeah, sorry about that. And uh, Patch, too. And your friend, Britney. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, who is Patch? Slimy, druglord that owned that little makeshift pumpkin patch thing on the side of the garage. Oh! God, that's so sad. Yeah, yeah, he was a really nice guy. Anyway, I'm gonna go find Connor and I'm gonna stop him. Okay, well then, I'm gonna come with you. Are you seriously gonna play the cliché hero guy right now?
