[lighthearted music] ♪ ♪ OH, LOOK, SARAH, YOU'RE DOING SO GOOD. HERE YOU GO. COME ON. HERE YOU GO. (Oliver Caldwell) GENTLEMEN, IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE, CCIT's GREEN INITIATIVE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES. WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ALL OF OUR INDUSTRIES. THE TRANSITION HAS BEEN PAINFUL, I ADMIT, BUT THAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED. THE SOLAIR PROJECT IS THE NEXT LOGICAL PHASE IN OUR DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT I'M SORRY, LOGIC HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THE FACT IS, WE ARE LOSING MONEY. WE'VE SUNK A FORTUNE INTO SOLAIR ALREADY, AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. (Oliver) YET. WALTER, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS EXPENSIVE, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE HERE. ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE MORE TIME. (Walter) TIME IS EXPENSIVE, OLIVER. WHEN YOU SPEND MORE THAN YOU MAKE, THAT'S CALLED A HOBBY. WE ARE RUNNING A BUSINESS HERE. THIS IS SMART BUSINESS FOR CCIT, WALTER. THIS IS A GAMBLE. IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE. WHOSE, HMM? THIS ISN'T ABOUT SELF-PROMOTION. I CREATED THIS COMPANY, WALTER, AND I HAVE NEVER LED IT ASTRAY. (Walter) THIS ISN'T A PRIVATE COMPANY ANYMORE. WE ANSWER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. OUR STOCK PRICE HAS DROPPED, PROFITS ARE DOWN. IT'S ONLY SHORT-TERM. EVERY MONTH, IT'S THE SAME. YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT A FUTURE THAT NEVER COMES. AS CFO, IT IS MY JOB TO LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LINE. THE HEALTH OF THE PLANET IS THE BOTTOM LINE, WALTER. YOUR FATHER KNEW THAT. THAT'S WHY WE WENT INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, MY WIFE AND I HAVE SOME FAMILY COMMITMENTS TO ATTEND TO. [overlapping chatter] UH-HUH, YES, EXACTLY. I UNDERSTAND. WALTER, I NEED YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS. LOOK AT THE PROJECTIONS. WE'LL PICK THIS UP AGAIN WHEN JENNY AND I ARE BACK FROM OUR VACATION. IT MAY PROVE TO BE A VERY LONG VACATION. HAUSEN IS DETERMINED TO SHOOT THIS DOWN. HE'S JUST SHORT-SIGHTED. THE REST OF THE BOARD, THEY'LL COME AROUND. IF SOLAIR COMES AROUND. WE GOTTA GET MOVING. WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE FOR ALEX'S GRADUATION. KATIE'S FLIGHT WAS DELAYED. SHE'LL PROBABLY BE LATE, BUT SHE'S GONNA MEET US THERE. OKAY. HI! HOW DID SHE DO? OH, SHE WON'T TAKE HER BOTTLE, MA'AM. ALL SARAH EVER WANTS IS HER MOMMY. (Jenny) WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE SHE KNOWS ME BEST. THIS TRIP WILL CHANGE ALL THAT. THANK YOU. JUST LIKE HIS HYDROGEN-POWERED CAR, OLIVER RUNS ON HOT AIR. [ceremonial music] [applause] [whistles] YO, SO CALDWELL, WHAT'S GOING DOWN TODAY? WE'RE GONNA GRADUATE, GO TO COLLEGE. WHITE PICKET FENCE. YEAH, RIGHT. YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING IN THE WORKS FOR TODAY. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THERE HE IS. THERE. AND HAROLD CZOL. [applause] CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. WE DID IT! [cheering] AND FINALLY, OUR CLASS VALEDICTORIAN. WHILE EXCELLING IN ACADEMICS, HE WAS ALSO THE CAPTAIN OF THE DEBATE TEAM. HE WAS THE SENIOR CLASS PRESIDENT.

IF WE'RE NOT GOING HOME, WHERE ARE WE GOING? WHY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING NORMAL FOR A CHANGE? THIS IS REALLY KIND OF AMAZING. KATIE, I PROMISE, YOU CAN STILL RELAX AND DO NOTHING ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BEACH YOU'VE EVER SEEN. (Alex) A BEACH? FINALLY A CLUE. THE ONLY ONE YOU'RE GETTING TOO, BUD. LAST YEAR, DAD TOLD US WHERE WE WERE GOING, AND SOMEONE BLABBED IT. (Alex) TO MY MATH TUTOR, WHO TOLD IT TO HIS MOM AND PUT IT ON THE INTERNET. UH-BUH-BUH. EVERYWHERE WE WENT, WE WERE UP TO OUR EYEBALLS IN PRESS AND PAPARAZZI. (Oliver) WHAT'S THE WEATHER DOING? SIX HOURS GETS US IN AT... SIX HOURS? I'LL BE BACK. SIX HOUR FLIGHT, HEADING WEST/SOUTHWEST. DAD, WE'RE, LIKE, 30,000 FEET UP IN THE AIR IN A PRIVATE JET. I THINK YOUR SECRET'S SAFE. YEAH, BUT KEEPING YOU GUESSING IS JUST SO MUCH MORE FUN FOR ME. [Katie and Ariana laugh] COME ON, DAD. (Alex) STOP. COME ON, DAD. [Sarah fusses] YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS, I'M TRYING TO GET SARAH SETTLED. PLEASE? UHH! WHY DOES DAD DO THIS? OH, HONEY, IT WAS REALLY SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

[Katie and Ariana laugh] OH! WHAT A GREAT IDEA. (Oliver) NIGEL'S IDEA. I TOLD HIM WE WANTED A CASUAL VACATION FOR A CHANGE. HE SUGGESTED WE COME HERE. HIS BROTHER RUPERT LIVES IN SAN JUAN. RUPERT THE NOVELIST, RIGHT? UH, SORT OF. UNPUBLISHED, I THINK. WOW. IT'S SO PEACEFUL. WHY DID DAD BRING THE BODYGUARDS? (Oliver) I ONLY SPOKE TO HIM ONCE, BUT HE INSISTED ON ARRANGING EVERYTHING FOR US. EXCEPT, APPARENTLY, OUR TRANSPORTATION. [bus honking] [tires squeal] WHAT? (Rupert) THERE YOU ARE AND HERE I AM. A FEW MOMENTS LATE, I CONCEDE. RUPERT? YES, RUPERT KENT, INDEED. AND YOU MUST BE MRS. CALDWELL. A GOOD DEAL YOUNGER THAN NIGEL'S DESCRIPTION, I MUST SAY. PLEASE CALL ME JENNY. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
