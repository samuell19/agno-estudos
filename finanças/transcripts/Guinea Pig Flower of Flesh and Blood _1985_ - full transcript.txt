Selling or showing this film to persons who are under 18 years old should be forbidden, because of the many graphic depictions of cruelty and brutality in the film. It was in April 1985, the time of full cherry blossoms in Tokyo, bizarre cartoonist Hideshi Hibino received one horrible parcel from an unidentified person who calls himself an enthusiastic fan of the cartoonist, Hideshi Hibino. The parcel contained one 8mm film, 54 still pictures and a 19-page letter. The letter told the cartoonist that a horrible and bizarre crime seemed to have been performed by the person of aesthetic paranoia in some secret place. The 8mm film was considered to be a vivid and authentic film showing an unidentified man chop the body of a woman into pieces and put her into his collection. Therefore, this film should not be shown to other people. Hideshi Hibino newly created this video as a restructured Semi-Documentary based on the 8mm film, pictures and letter. No! Look! This is your fate! The women is at present in a state of ecstasy from an injection of drugs. She feels no pain at all, as you see. Not only does she feel no pain but the feeling is rather pleasurable. When her bright red blood starts to creep voluptuously and creature-like on her white skin, like blossoms of blood and flesh blooming in a sea of red, truly a dazzling, intoxicating rapture. There is absolutely nothing more beautiful in life than this. I am going to show you the ideal of beauty. First of all, red blossoms of blood blooming from her wrist. Next, full blossoms from her shoulder, and from her red lips. Now, for the last moment, a big flower emerges around her petal and wraps her body with blooms and fragrance. And now, her bowels start dancing wildly on her body and bloom many blossoms. Next she wears a necklace of bright red blooms around her neck. Well, now, the finishing touch is to take out her precious jewels. Ah, this is the most beautiful thing of a woman's body. This is it! Finally, blood and flesh blooming perfect flowers. Now, I will put them into my collection. Now, I am going to present my collection to you. Fall, fall, fall to the bottom of Hell, pool of blood, sea of fire and needle mountains. Fall man to hell. Fall, fall, demons of Hell are calling you, pool of blood, sea of fire and needle mountains. Can't you hear the groan of the dead? Fall, fall, the darkness of Hell is boundless, pool of blood, sea of fire and needle mountains. It is the lullaby of hell. This is the summarized story of the contents of the 8mm film, still pictures and letter. It is assumed that at least two criminals where involved in the crime. One has executed the person and the other has taken this film. At the same time, many women have been victimized. According to our source, the police started a secret investigation. It is also assumed that such an unprecedented bizarre crime is in the criminal record of Japan and will become clear in the near future.
