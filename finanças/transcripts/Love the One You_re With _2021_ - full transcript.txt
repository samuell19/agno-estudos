(dramatic music) (soft piano music) - [Miles] Life has a funny way of showing your true colors. If love was an actual person, I swear things would be different. Can you honestly ask yourself are you worthy of unconditional love? Because I'm still trying to figure that out. (clearing throat) (shushing) (gentle piano music) - Oh my God. (yelling) - [Female] What you doing here? - [Male] Uh, I just wanted to say sorry for Rock. He shouldn't have done that to you last night. - Mmm, can you hand me my phone? - [Male] Yeah I know. - [Female] Look, I know he sent you all the way out here to check on me but I ain't stopping. - [Male] No, no, he didn't. It just felt like I should. You know? Look, Rock, he a good dude, he just don't know it yet. He in a phase. - So I take it you ain't enjoying the movie? - It's a'ight. - [Male] Imani Jackson? You know Imani? - [Female] Best friends since middle school. - I'mma head out for a bit, go for a quick run, get some fresh air. - In casual clothes? - Can you worry about your movie? - Uh, how long you gonna be? Do you want me to pause the movie till you get back? - [Miles] It's up to you. - Well damn, could you at least leave the damn snacks? I know he just didn't. God damn. He coulda kept these stale ass Red Vines. (gentle jazz music) - You're the absolute worst. Like how hard is it to get me some avocado toast, okay, with a non-fat extra large, extra foamy non-fat latte with three, three, Stevias okay, stirred with nutmeg on top? - And I'm telling you I smoke too much weed to remember all that. - And now you're bragging about using marijuana. - Excuse me, excuse me. You don't get to judge my Buddhist practice. - Oh really, a Buddhist practice? (speaking in foreign language) Amen. - This is unfucking believable. You just ruined my day with this shit. I'm gonna be late for my conference call. Do you know what? I am gonna take my business across the street to CVS to buy a Red Bull and I will be writing a crappy review on you on Yelp. - Red Bull gives you wings, go chug one down and flap out of here, girl. - Gimme one minute, aight? - One minute? I would hope you can go for longer than that. - Excuse me? - Oh I ain't say nothing. Come a little closer, I ain't gonna bite. - Oh hey. What's up babe? 'Bout time you showed up. - Can you stop harassing my date? - Your date? He was standing up in here flirting with me. - What? - I tell you men ain't shit. He knew he was waiting on a date and gonna stand up in here looking at me all horny and eager. - I did what? - No, you can't have my Instagram. - Jazz, don't pay this fool any more attention. That's my friend Rene, he's the manager of this establishment. Rene and I have been friends for six years. This is his way of entertaining. What were you about to order? - Um, a sticky barn and a hot cocoa? - There you go, flirting with me again. - You don't have to go through this. Go sit down, I'll get it for you. Go sit down. - Aight. - Can you act like you have some damn sense? Give me a veggie frittata. - Don't be throwing your little funky debit card at me. And ain't you married? Why you I here fucked up with this fine ass man? - Because I'm tired of the one I got at home. I've been seeing a couple of guys, but this one, I like this one. He's sexy and fun, a breath of fresh air. - And got you in here paying for the date. If you gonna step out, at least don't step out and be a pip pip. - No, I chose to take care of this one because you can't control yourself. Besides, I'm really happy. It's been five months. - Five months and I thought I was your best friend? Way to break the news to a bitch. Does he know he's your side piece? - No, he doesn't know. - Sticky buns and hot cocoa. - Now the help in here flirting with me. - That's part of what makes it fun. Just do me a favor and keep your big mouth closed. - Take your little veggie frittata and go over there and finish being an adultress. - Bye Rene. Behave. - No, you behave. - [Miles] I'll call you later. - Mmhmm. - [Female] Excuse me, can I get a mocha- - Take your ass to Starbucks. (gentle music) - Come on, let's go outside. (gentle music) - Oh this fool's on a home date. He ought to be ashamed of himself. - That sticky bun was good, yo. - I know. Ain't no telling what Rene did to that thing. - He is a character, you know what? What's up with him? - Everything. I think he's bipolar or something. - Really? - Mmhmm. Something 'cause all that at the cafe that was the most- - [Rene] Bitch don't think you got mental health challenges to keep your little conversation going. - Bitch, what the hell are you doing out here following us? - [Rene] Ain't nobody following y'all. I came out here for a walk. You know they good for my mental health. - If you don't carry your nosy ass back to your cafe- - You need to take your ass back home to your husband. - [Jazz] Who? - Oh, I said Yo Hubbin, Yo Hubbin, those pills for bipolar? Yeah, I left them over his house last week after our sleepover. I got to go y'all. I'll call you later. - Uh huh. - Please forgive me. My friends seem to be a little overprotective. - You think? I mean he just followed us three blocks and then he eavesdropping in the bushes. I mean come on. (phone buzzing) (gentle music) You good? - Yeah. I'm glad we're getting to spend a little bit more time together. You've been a little harder to catch up with lately. - No, that's you. - I know. It can be a little busy at work from time to time. - Yeah, well you know I canceled on my boys to link with you tonight so I'm gonna need that same courtesy from you. - Trust me, you'll definitely get it. - Well damn, you fine as hell. - Mmhmm, enough of the sweet talk though. Aren't you supposed to be taking me to the movies? - Ugh, damn babe, I forgot to tell you. Those two shows, they were booked by the time I could purchase the tickets. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, I'll tell you what, how 'bout you come to my place tonight? We can drink some wine, I got Hulu, Prime, Netflix, Disney Plus, I got all that. Okay? You can spend a couple hours there and I'll put you in an Uber home, like we normally do. Is that cool? - Only 'cause I really like you. That's it. - [Jazz] That's it? - That's it. (gentle music) (alarm beeping) Oh shit. - You headed out? - Yeah, I overslept, it's 7:15. - Damn. We knocked out, huh? - And didn't even get to finish the movie. - Yeah, who's fault was that? - Yours. - [Jazz] What? - You let me drink all that wine and then took advantage of me. - No, it wasn't my fault. You were the one laying up here looking all good. - [Miles] Whatever. - Whatever. Come here. - You know these past few months have been real fine. Maybe we should start thinking about a relationship. - Relationship? - Mmhmm. - Isn't that your Uber? - Look, how 'bout I go to work, come back over here later on tonight and then we talk about making it official? - Aight bet. - Okay cool. - You better get going before he cancels on you. - I know, right? I'll see you later, cutie. - Aight.

You don't even call or text me. And you've been calling and blowing up my phone every morning for the past three months. What is going on? - Mom, I'm just a little depressed. - What? What, depressed? Black people don't get depressed. Hell, sad don't even run in our family. Now you might be a little tired or you might need a little money or something. Did you check your sugar?

I can't take care of your big ass. - Miles, you know what? I think this is not working out. I think I need to move out. - I agree. - So that's it? You're not gonna fight for anything? - I don't think you're worth fighting for anymore, Avery. Fuck. - Hey you ain't even gonna take no fucking shower? - I'll take on eat the gym and I probably won't be back tonight so don't wait up.

We're here to give you a good time with coffee and pastries of course. (growls) How can I help you? - Hey you probably got a line of customers over there getting on your nerves. - Oh bitch you know it and they won't leave 'cause they're just standing here staring at me. - You're at work. - [Rene] You called me. Can you see what they want? - I don't know how to work the register. That's your job, remember? - [Rene] Excuse me, I'm your boss. Who you think you talking to you? - You, the fuck? - Mmm, he just turned me the hell on. Anyway, it's unlike you to be calling me this time of evening. What's happening? - I need you to meet my best friend right now. - Oh Lord, don't tell me that fool done gave you anal warts. Did that nig-nog done gave you the cauliflower? - [Miles] Rene! - Okay. - I came home and Avery had all his stuff packed up and he moved out. And I think old boy that I was seeing ghosted on me. - What? - You probably scared him away. - Yo mama. Well can you really be surprised? I mean you've been with your man for years and all of a sudden you want to stop working on a relationship 'cause you tired. Then mix that with the little googly eyes you came up in here with. - Googly eyes? - You left a wet spot in one of these chairs when you brought him in here. - Bitch, I did not sit down. - Well, you were definitely dripping. You left a trail and that's the way I was able to follow y'all. - You right. I guess I kinda messed up, huh? - I don't know. If I was him, I would be done with you. You know how many people want what you and him had? - Hello. - Don't you see me on the phone? - Hey, how you doing? - Hello? - Okay great. He's at work and he needs to take my order. Uh huh, all right, all right, great. Hallelujah, thank you. - Hello? - I hate rude customers. I know you didn't just- - I sure did.

And if not, I can come back down and get it. By the way. - What's up? - You're really hot when you're not trying so hard. - Well, no he didn't. (Miles groaning) (phone buzzing) Well my God, the dead has arisen. - I drank way too much last night. - I figured. I called your black ass three times. - I really need to get out of this house right now. You want to go to brunch? - Brunch, you're so gay. Child, you know I'm over here working. Yeah I'm doing a little catering order. You can come hang out if you want. Then maybe afterwards we can go do something. - Do I want to do that? Okay.

Girl, I'm telling you now what is going on with you? - Get in that house. - [All] Surprise! - Surprise bitch, yeah you know we got you. - Don't that bitch work the coffee machine? - I think she do. - Okay. - All right y'all, all right. Y'all good, y'all all right? - Yes ma'am, we're good. - No sweetie, you see what I meant by that was you did wash your little nasty hands before touching all this good food here, right? - Yes. - Actually we were playing in our asses while we were preparing the food. Make sure your hands are clean so you can be ready to eat up. - You know what, I ain't messing with you, fool. This does look kind of good. Okay. Listen here, y'all better behave yourselves, okay? This is a guest of honor and the reason I stayed at that damn job all them years. - Oh my, you sure know how to make a girl feel special. - You look familiar. Have you been over to that cafe? It's over on Slauson. - Uh cafe, no. Now had you said the liquor store or the weed dispensary, then yes. - [Rene] I know, that's right, okay? - Hey mama. - Oh that's my baby. Oh my God, you made it. Hi baby, how are you? You guys, this is my son, Avery. - Hey Avery, how you doing? - [Rene] Hey Avery. Hi friend. - Hey mom, this is my new roommate, Jazz. - Hi. - Oh hi Jazz, you got two roommates now? Y'all all right, what's going on? - J, you know what, can you take my mother inside? I'mma wrap up, get you a little plate. Mama, we gonna cater to you. Go on in there and chill out. Uh huh with your bad self. Uh huh, okay, all right now. - Your roommate, since when? - That's the guy that I've been dating for the past couple months. - [Rene] Couple months? - You know me and Miles broke up. - Yeah, a couple weeks ago. - Look, I'm not out to my mother yet. So can we not have this conversation right here right now please? - Avery, come on ho, go ahead and make her a plate. - He coming. Make his mama a plate. - I'm serious, Rene, chill. - Old dusty bastard. - You sure know how to keep things interesting. - What'd I do? - You tell me. - Oh shit. - Attention everyone. Attention everyone, attention everyone, all right, do I have your attention? Okay listen. I'm gonna make this quick because I do not like talking in front of crowds but I'll do anything for my good friend over there. - Girl, ain't nothing a little Hennessy and a reefer joint can't fix. - That's her problem, always talking shit. That's why I love you. I had to put this together to show you how much we appreciate you. - [Male] Mmhmm. - Avery, don't you want to say something to your mama? - Hell no. - Boy, get over here and say something to your mama. - Hey, I meant to call you. You might want to go home. - Go home? - Yes. - It took way too much work to get over here. - That's your problem. - And I'm hung over. You getting on my nerves. - You getting on my nerves. - Where's the bathroom? - At your house. All right, it's in there. I'm 'bout to find a way to lock that bitch up in there. - Like Pam- - Miss Pam, but I am looking for a mister. - Like Miss Pam said, I don't like talking in front of crowds either but mom, words just can't really express everything that you've done for me and everything you taught me growing up has just been nothing but amazing and all of your hard work, I just want to say I'm proud of you. - Thank you, baby. Well enough of this whole sappy shit. Let's get the party started, y'all, come on. Let's party y'all come on. Hey, come on, y'all. - Everybody raise your glass. Yes all right, now shake your asses, okay? There we go. - Yo, this food everything. Everything was so good, so good. You have a cafe, right? I think I've been there before. - You sure have. You can't forget this face, darling. - Especially when you followed me down the road. - Bitch, don't play with me. I'll throw this ranch in your ass. - What? - [Rene] You heard me, ho. - Anyway, you have a bathroom, you know a bathroom somewhere? - Yeah, it's in the back. You got one more fucking time. - Uh uh, the closest bathroom I know is this Chinese restaurant about five blocks up that way. - Five blocks? - Five blocks. As a matter of fact, here, take this money and get you some egg rolls. Support minority businesses. They can't stay up if you just going in there using their bathrooms. Egg rolls, soy sauce. - There's not a bathroom- - Five blocks that way. (speaking in foreign language) Right that way. Don't put pressure on your bladder. - I am quite impressed with how you handled this. - This is too much, okay? Uh uh. Percocet? - Well, if it makes you feel any better, you're handling things quite well. - Fuck you, don't try to sweet talk me. - I'm not trying to sweet talk you. I'm just saying that it's, it's sexy to see you working under pressure. - Okay, so first the kiss in the parking lot, now this. Let me tell you something, I don't know what you're trying to do, but I'm not a ho. - I didn't call you that. I wouldn't say such a thing about you. And I would never call you such a thing. - You know I like that. I can be a ho for a man that respects me. Respect is a turn on. (gentle music) - You're the last person I need to see right now. - I'm not particularly excited to see your ass either. - Come on, they're throwing this little party for my mom. Wait, did Rene invite you? - Yeah unfortunately. - The world is so small. I came over here 'cause they said the other bathroom wasn't working. - It's working fine. Look, I'm sor- - Look I'm sorry the way that things went down between you and I. - This is the first time I've seen you since you left. All these years and you just, it's that easy for you to erase me from your life? - Me erase you? - Yes. - You stopped talking to me, you stopped coming home. - And you stopped fighting. - How am I supposed to be the only one fighting in this relationship, Miles? I've been fighting for the last few years. - I don't know. I just feel like you started making it easy to do so, even before hell broke loose. (gentle music) Uh uh, uh uh. Do you still love me, Avery? (Avery sighs) Okay noted. Wow. You know you really ain't shit for that. All this in the hallway and you still the same. I know you packed all your stuff up and moved out but you left a bag with your sports stuff in it and if you want it, it'll be in the garage. (Avery sighs) - You know I could never imagine talking to my boss like this. I mean, you're not even my type, right? Well not usually. - Boy please, don't lie to yourself. I know you feel all the sexual energy oozing off me. - Here comes your buddy. You might need to figure out how to clean up this little fire you started. - You would think you would be a better friend by now. - I'm guessing somebody must have blew it up in that bathroom and I forgot to tell you, huh? - You know exactly what I'm talking about, Rene. You could have warned me that that nigger was here. - I didn't know. I'm here to work, not moderate your drama. - Drama? - Drama. I didn't know. - You know what? My head is still hurting and this is some bullshit. - Give me some bullshit. - I'm 'bout to go. I'll call you later. - Recharge your crystals or something, your energy's off. - Mom, how long you think you gonna be here? I'm not feeling too well, I think I'm gonna go home. - I think you need to go over there and sit your porky ass down and get you a ginger ale and put some Alka-Seltzer in it or something. The party ain't even started good yet. - Ma, I been busy at work, like I got a lot of stuff to do. I think I need to go lay down. - Anyway back to you, next time you want to address me, put some respect on my name, you understand me? It's Miss Bitch. (gentle music) Now go get me some coffee or something. - Hey, where were you at? I was trying to text you. - My fucking phone died, man I was using Google Maps to find that Chinese restaurant up the street. - Why the fuck were you at a Chinese restaurant? - They said the bathrooms were out of order. - But the, you know what, never mind. You ready to go? - Yeah, I been ready. Wait hold on, let me just drop these egg rolls off, all right? - Okay. - What are you doing? - I'm trying not to break a nail. Why are you getting in my face? I'm trying to work. Can you let me work? Why you all up in this? - Well honey, this egg salad is everything, okay? - Yes, that's the special keep your man from straying off recipe, okay? - Keep your man from straying off? Where your man at? - Right there. I gave him a spoonful in the car. You see he ain't left since we been in here, okay? - I am not his man. - Whatever. I gave him a spoonful and his dose is wearing off. - Well got to keep him dosed up, okay? - [Rene] Dosed up, okay. - You wanted egg rolls, right? - Yeah bitch, but you don't have to throw 'em. - Thank you so much for coming. Thank you so much for coming. These were delicious. - Couldn't call my Uber because I left my damn phone. - Psst, what's going on up in here? - You don't want to know. - No I want to know. What's going on? - [Rene] Honey, you don't want to know. - You better tell me what's going on up in here. - [Rene] You don't want to know. - If you want to get paid, you better tell me what's going on up in here. - Okay so that fool that threw the egg rolls ghosted the one who left his phone. - Ghosted him? - No girl, it's a mess. - Damn! - It's a mess. - Maybe you should've given him some of that egg salad. (laughing) - [Rene] You wrong, child, it's a mess. (mysterious music) - What am I invisible? You ghost me, then walk past me like you never seen me before? - Let's not make a scene, all right? - Make a scene? You waste five months of my life texting me and calling me everyday, making promises and telling me sweet nothings and now all of a sudden I'm nothing? - You were never nothing to begin with. - Oh okay. - Hey babe, you ready to go? - Yeah, let's get out of here. - Babe? Babe? So when did this happen? - Yeah, yeah, this is my boyfriend, all right, we're together, we're happy. So take the hint and move on. - So this is why you won't call me back and want to fight for our relationship? - Wait a minute, wait a God damn minute. Uh, uh, this is my son, you can't be hitting on my son. I will fuck you up. - Then you need to teach your son how to be a better boyfriend. - [Jazz] Like one of those crazy mother fuckers not knowing how to let go. - Crazy? I'll show you crazy. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, just relax. - Shit. - Wait, wait, wait. - Hey, hey, hey, calm down right now. Stop it right now. I don't want to call 'em or whatever 'cause they be killing black folks and stuff but I will call the police on your ass or bust a cap in here. I know rent is expensive and everything but you gonna have to find you a new roommate, baby. - [Miles] Roommate? - Avery, how much money do you owe him? - Barbra, I don't understand why you're so in denial, honey. But I'll say it again, boyfriend. Avery has been my boyfriend for six years, not a roommate, boyfriend. - My son ain't no punk or no sissy. - I never said your son was a punk, lady, I said Avery is my boyfriend. - [Jazz] Actually, he's my boyfriend. - I don't know, ma'am. He sounds like a punk and a sissy to me. - Oh my God. Avery, I don't understand what's going on over here. Are you a part of that community? - Mama, I- - I just need you to answer the question that I'm asking you, son. Are you one of them alphabet people? Are you one of the gays? - Do I need to show her pictures I have of you on my phone? - I need an answer, Avery. - Ma, I- - Avery, I need an answer. Are these two men out here fighting over you, are they your lovers? - Yes, yes ma'am. - Okay, I'mma need you to get this messy mother fucker you done brought here with you and go home. - Mama, I'm sorry. - Hey, I need you to go home. I don't love you any less, I just need to sort some things out here. I mean I raised you to be a strong black man and you can't be that playing in other men's asses. - I don't mean to get in your business, but from what I knew about him, he's at his strongest, especially when he's in other men's asses. - That's just some sick shit right there. You freaky mother fuckers, y'all are just freaky as fuck. Go home now. - Ma- - I don't want to hear it. Just go. Down here, y'all done came all the way down here and embarrassed me in front of my coworkers. - Mama, I'm sorry. - Miss Barbra, come on girl, let's go in the kitchen, make you a drink. (dark music) - So it's over, just like that, we're nothing? - He is so bad for your mental health and mine's. Come on, let's go. (dark music) - Miles, Miles, look I know you might not want to talk to me right now but just go home and rest. Okay, I called an Uber, it's gonna be here in like four minutes. His name's Averie. Not yours though, this one is spelled with an i-e, not a Y, i-e. - God, the universe, sure has a sense of humor. - [Rene] Call you tonight? - Sure, no pressure. - Excuse me, hold on, honey. Look back here, mmhmm, all right. Listen, love is crazy and it makes you do crazy things and puts you in crazy situations, okay? Now next time you need to feed him some of that egg salad. - Egg salad? - Yes honey 'cause then next time he would've been fighting for you. Next time, all right? Be safe, God bless you. ♪ Oh that egg salad ♪ ♪ That egg salad ♪ (gentle music) - Hey baby, I just want to say thank you for everything. The food was good, everything was nice, except that tomfoolery at the end. - Thank you. I know it's hard but you should, you should be proud of your son. It takes a whole lot to be a black gay man. - Yeah, I can imagine. I don't know, I just don't know if I can accept it right now. I raised him a certain way and I have a lot of questions like how would his life be? Could he catch AIDS? I mean I want him to be happy and everything but I want to be a grandmother. What about me? - Well, he'll be fine and I think you did a good job. You should be proud of yourself too. - I mean he had a roommate he was living with paying $1,300 a month in Leimert and then his new roommate has moved him all the way out to West Hollywood. - Miss Barbra, it's not his roommate, that's his boyfriend and West Hollywood, God damn, rent over there is like $4,000 a month. - $4,000 a month? - [Rene] Yes girl. - With a minimum wage job with somebody he just met? - Yes. - Child, dick make you do dumb shit whether you're straight or gay.
