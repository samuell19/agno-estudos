Ages and ages ago, in the time of our ancestors, the forces of evil led by Shadower had subjugated almost the entire world. The kingdom of Golan Mor, the last remaining bulwark of civilization, was on the verge of succumbing to evil's fury. My valiant warriors. Sire, shouldn't we be in battle? Hold onto your bold enthusiasm my young Altar, there is a much more substantial task that awaits you. And I did not want it. We are the last stronghold of the Ancestral World. Shadawar spreads death and destruction. One last effort is all I ask of you. An extreme sacrifice to slow down his advance to completion of the Great Wizard spell. Don't worry, Sire. We are ready. No. You cannot imagine what power he wields. I assure you it is something beyond our means. All we can do is slow him down. He's coming. You treacherous son of a bitch! Your point of view is limited, but I understand. We were at peace! All the kingdoms were at peace! Are you crazy? No, brother. It was not peace. It was a privileged situation for us nobles. It was a stalemate. It was immobility. It was death. Things had to get started. And this is the solution? Complete destruction? Yes. While my King and faithful friend strove to hold back Shadawar on the battlefield, I, Melek, in those last moments of my life was preparing to cast my darkest spell. The King's valiant soldiers fought fiercely to stop Shadawar. But all seemed to be lost. Is that all you have? You're not worthy. I am Shadawar! Hold fast, my King, hold fast! We are the Last Keepers of the Ancestral World, and we will survive to sing songs of this moment. Why? Why all this? Are you a fool? No! I'm the god of destruction! Melek! Here I am, my friend. This is for you! That day, Shadawar, the god of destruction, and all his army, were defeated by my sacrifice. Golan Mor came at the head of those who did not want to fall into the alliance of Shadawar. But war is terrible and even a great leader cannot win forever, especially cannot conquer time. More and more tired, Golan Mor was waiting for the moment when he passed the command to his two sons, Iruma and Mairok. The two brothers were valiant leaders, and under their leadership, the forces still loyal to Shadawar suffered heavy defeats. The forces of chaos retreated. Peace was coming back. And you're done. Although, the enemy's not gonna tell you the same. You're more than likely gonna have a blade piercing your neck. I really thought I was in trouble. You know what amazes me? Even after almost a decade of fighting Shadawar's evil forces, you still carry a tender heart. You know Mairok, sometimes I just wish... I just wish you would... Be more like you, brother. No. I wish you wouldn't hesitate. Because when it comes time to fight those evil forces, as you know, they are not gonna show mercy, so why should you? All right, how about a rematch? Go. Mairok, are you okay? I think so. Iruma, behind you! - Mairok! - Iruma, no! No, Iruma! Get up, my son. I'm sorry, Father. We will find your brother. Come with me. Atia, I believe you have news for us. Yes, my king, but you have to act immediately. Explain, Atia. Prince Iruma is still alive but there is a reason that he has not yet been killed. Our enemies have hidden their intentions, which have been obscured up to this point. I ask you forgiveness, sire. Don't ask me for forgiveness. I want to know what's going on. The forces of chaos are losing the war with their weapons. That's why they decided to use a descendant of the original ancestral lineage of the world to use one of our weapons against us. The Sacred Armor. But I thought the Sacred Armor was just a legend. No, my son. It was used in a previous war, but considered too dangerous by the Mother of All. It was then broken into four different pieces, each of which was entrusted to a Guardian. But now it is possible that the forces of chaos will use Iruma to retrieve it. Iruma risks becoming a puppet in the hands of our enemies. I will recover it. I will find it before they do and I will save Iruma. It will be very difficult, Prince Mairok. If you move with an army, or even a group of men, you risk being attacked. I know you have a spell that can make only one person invisible to their magic. So I will go alone. Sire? Atia! I'm... I'm fine. The spell requires a lot of energy. You will not feel anything, but it worked. You will be invisible to the enemies. I promise, Father, I will bring Iruma home. I trust you, boy. Atia! Open the portal. Good luck, my son. Wow! Do you think I don't trust my son? Monitoring him will not be helpful. Indeed, this spell of connection, though protected, could give our enemies a way to re-trace us. We'll run the risk. I know he's the only one who can complete the mission. I don't wanna lose him too. Vo' Segh ngo? Do you belong to the ancient race? Yes. Are you here for the Sacred Armor? Yes. I possess one of the four stones that can summon one part, but this stone keeps the balance of my lands. The entire Ancestral World is in danger of being destroyed. I need that stone in order to keep that from happening. You had entrusted this in our care. There's a war out there. I've seen it. I fought in it. You don't want this to end badly for everyone, I beg you, please give me that stone. And you would like to save the Ancestral World from the forces of evil? You make me laugh. You're pathetic. I've tried to be patient with you, splinter face. I am Mairok! Son of Golan Mor! I have fought on the bastions of Orion! I have defeated the armies of Shadawar! What do you know about me? He succeeded. Have confidence in your son, my king. The time available is short, but he will do it. Please. Do not force me to kill you! I am here to save the Ancestral World and everyone in it! And that includes all of you. Sisters, get up. Warrior. Why disturb the peace of my temple? It was not my intention. My sincerest apologies. Why are you here? To save the Ancestral World from that bastard Shadawar's tyranny. Shadawar. Get up. Come inside and tell me more. But, my queen. Sister, quiet! I can understand perfectly well that this man has no hostile intention. Therefore, I want to listen to what he has to say. Free him! Where's the stone? The stone that evokes the Sacred Armor? I have it. How do you know what that is? I thought by now the memory of that stone would have been lost in time. How do you know? You're so... young. I am much older than you can imagine, young one. So, what do they call you? I am Mairok, son of Golan Mor. A prince, of course. I am Lantris and I have been here for many years without being able to grow old. Without being able to leave. And all because of that bastard. A long time ago, Shadawar began to conquer the surrounding territories of your father's kingdom. One by one, rulers devoted themselves to his cause betraying Golan Mor. His evil reign reached even as far as these lands. My Amazons and I resisted as long as we could, but our efforts were futile and in our defeat Shadawar took over. He possessed one of the stones that could evoke the Sacred Armor, and he used that power against me, binding me to the stone forever. You fought with honor, and thus I'll spare the lives of you and your Amazons. I'll be back when the time is rights. Until then, you will be cursed to be the guardian of the stone! Over time, some of the Shadawar's allies tried to overthrow him and seize the stone. One of them managed to mortally wound me or, so I thought. I did not die. After that, I met a clairvoyant named Atia. I sought her help to figure out what had happened to me. Shadawar used the power of the stone to make you immortal. And only through that same stone you can get back to being an ordinary human being. She did everything in her power to break the spell but Shadawar's curse was too powerful. Only that one day a warrior will come who will be able to break the spell. So, why should I care about saving this Ancestral World of yours? It's not just that. It is to save someone very important to me. Tell me more. I don't have much time before my brother becomes a puppet in their hands. With that armor... they can destroy the entire Ancestral World and everyone in it. And that includes your Amazons. I understand. And I will help you but I cannot give you the stone, so I will go with you. No. It's something I must do on my own. Don't be a fool, Mairok. I'm immortal and an ally that cannot die may be very beneficial. I don't know what to say. How about goodnight? Lantris! Who are you? Did Shadawar send you? What have you done with Lantris? Lantris! No, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. Lantris, I didn't mean to. I thought you were the one. I did not die, I will never die! My family, my friends, they've all disappeared and I will stay like this, alone forever. Forgive me. Forgive me, Mairok. I really thought you were the one. I knew I couldn't convince you to kill me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wait here. Sisters, get up. I've decided to join the prince's journey. But, my queen! My duty is to guard the stone. Wherever the stone goes, I'll go with it and maybe on this trip I'll find a way to break the spell that had cursed me. Okay, but we come with you. No. The prince is protected by a spell that makes him invisible to his enemies, and even this curse allows me to be invisible as well. But... I need you here. My king. Well, Atia? The prince was able to recover the second stone. So, everything is going as it should. Maybe there is a hope. I'm sure, my lord. And now your son is also being helped by someone. What? The mission has been discovered? No, my lord, this is someone that I have known a long time ago. Mairok, are you okay? Maybe we should slow down. You don't understand! We don't have time! If even one of the stones falls in the hands of our enemies, my brother and the entire Ancestral World are doomed! Mairok! Mairok. What happened? The vital signs of Mairok. What happened to him? - Is... - No, not dead. But they are very weak. Wounded in combat? Was he betrayed by that person you told me about? No, my lord. Your son is... An idiot! What a complete idiot. I've never met someone so devoted to his cause to risk his own life for it. Lantris. What happened? You fell unconscious. Now could you please explain to me why you kept hidden the wound that I caused you during our fight? You really are an idiot, Prince Mairok, son of Golan Mor. Ah. Careful. Better. Get some rest. The stone should help you heal. Yeah. What about you? You must be exhausted. Since I've been given this curse, Mairok, I do not feel the need to rest, nor drink, nor eat, nor... What's wrong? What are you thinking? Many men wish for immortality. But if they really knew what it meant to be immortal, I'm sure they would change their minds. Oh, look. Look, there. It seems too damn easy. I agree. That's why I will try to take the stone. But... Mairok, use your head. Right, you're invincible. That's right. Lantris! Don't worry about me. What are you do in my reign? Guardian! Show yourself! We're not here to fight, we just need your help. Guardian! Prove to me you are worthy of your first name. Free Lantris! Or what? All right, then... Do you really want to generate the wave of energy that could destroy this temple? Why not? That way you won't be able to hide like a coward. And if I were to kill her? That's impossible. She's immortal. Really? You're just trying to confuse me! She said she wants to get rid of the curse, but not die right away. Shut up. And if now that she has known you, she no longer wishes to die? Shut up! And you! Everyone would see that you're madly in love with her. You would not want to see her die, right, Prince Mairok? You can do better than that. I'll be right back. Show yourself! How about you try that again? How is this possible? I can see you now. It's the connection between the stones. I can sense your energy. Prepare to die. I'm sorry, guardian. This is not how I wanted it to end. Now, free Lantris. Don't worry. Your time will come soon enough. Soon you will all die, Prince Mairok, son of Golan Mor. How do you know me? I was created to protect the stone from Shadawar and he's making his return. You've been here for too long. Shadawar is dead. Melek defeated him with a spell 10 years ago. All that actually died was his physical form, not his soul, which lived on. He still commands the dark forces... and now has a new physical form, a body from the ancestral race, and once he finds that Sacred Armor, then nothing will be able to stop him. Mairok! Lantris! My brother, the host body for Shadawar. Look, I'm not going to tell you I know what you're feeling but don't lose control. You already have three of the stones. Only one is left. We'll make it in time. We will. What do we do about him? There's nothing you can do for me. I'm going back into the shadows where I've always been. But beware, because Shadawar is coming back! And the Ancestral World will enter an age of darkness it has never seen before. He did it. Yes, my king, and every stone and each test makes him stronger, increases his powers. There is only one stone left. What do you see in the future? Maybe he really will succeed in saving his brother. He has already demonstrated many times his value in battle. Why do you doubt Mairok, my liege? Mairok has always lived in the shadow of his older brother Iruma. I thought he was a poor imitation of his older brother. I was wrong. He's a worthy son and a great warrior. He has a pure heart. And the man who can accomplish this task is a man like him. A man who deeply loves his brother. A man who believes in something for which is worth fighting. There it is. We're almost there. We will find your brother. I know. I know! You are not alone, remember this. Lantris, I... Whatever nonsense you're about to say, just wait until we've recovered the last stone. Right. Let's go. Look there. Go find the stone. I'll take care of this. Right. Welcome. I just need the stone. I don't wanna fight. Oh well, twice the fun. Yes. Oh, come on. Mairok? A little help? Perhaps you could be a hero after all. Perhaps. Did you get the stone? Of course I did. My king, he did it. Sorry to have doubted you, my son. Lantris, where is your stone? Is that supposed to happen? I have no idea! I was just trying to prevent someone else from evoking the Sacred Armor! It is not possible. What is not possible? Atia, tell me. When the four stones came together, their joint power swept away the magic. What do you mean? Explain yourself! That now Mairok is visible to the forces of Shadawar. Do something! Warn him of the danger he is in! My powers are not strong enough. I can't reach it with my mind. Now Mairok is alone. The Sacred Armor. Mairok, what's that? Stay back! That's the same portal my brother... My brother, Iruma! Mairok, watch out! Remember what the Shadow told you! Iruma! Brother! Brother. I was imprisoned by Shadawar's forces. They had me imprisoned until someone gathered the stones to evoke the Sacred Armor. Iruma. Your weak-minded brother tried to stop me. Little did he know, nothing can stop Shadawar! Not even death! No! You would have been better off staying dead. You want to fight me? You really are an idiot. Yeah, maybe, but don't underestimate this idiot. Iruma! Brother! Please, tell me a part of you is still inside there! Mairok, please. It's too easy... ...brother. I wish you wouldn't hesitate because when it comes time to fight those evil forces, they are not going to show mercy. So why should you? Time to die, sweet prince. And next up, your beloved king. Iruma, Father, forgive me. No! I'm sorry, my king. Everything is lost. Mairok. Iruma. Shadawar! How is this possible? I swore I'd return, Golan Mor. Atia! Call the guards! I fear she is so overwhelmed with emotion to be able to find her words. What happened to my sons? Your children are all dead, my dear king. And now it's your turn. The era of the Ancestral World ends here. This is the rise of my kingdom. The beginning of chaos! However, this isn't the right stage for my triumph. Come, King. It's time to die. This time, no one and nothing will be saving you. Mairok! Mairok! Mairok! Mairok! Mairok? Mairok. Lantris. You're right. I really am an idiot. No. Mairok. Mairok, stay with me. Mairok, don't! Mairok, please don't! Mairok! Please don't leave me, Mairok! The era of the Ancestral World ends here. You are a fool, Shadawar. You may kill me, but you will never win. Please. When you placed the last stone, I could feel the spell breaking. I haven't yet turned back into a mortal but I can now fully control the energy that makes me immortal. What happened? Don't worry about it. I finally realized what my purpose is. You are the warrior I was waiting for. I love you, Mairok. No. Don't do this. My life is worth nothing compared to yours. I lived centuries, Mairok. But I've never felt truly alive until I met you. Lantris. Lantris! An important destiny awaits you, young God. Go. Save your kingdom. Lantris. I'll come back, my love. Shadawar! You will pay for what you've done to me! You're still alive? That damned immortal. I should have killed you both. You don't want to understand. This is the Sacred Armor! Should this little scene impress me? It's the Sacred Armor, Shadawar. Exactly like yours. Perhaps even more powerful. You see, the armor is a concept, created long ago to store a large amount of energy in physical form. What you wear is simply a container of that energy. And the stones that evoke it are only one means to harness it. These arm guards given to me by my father. I created a bond with that energy and I'm now powerful enough to evoke a sacred armor of my own! Only through sacrifice and loss, a prince learns how to become a king. And so... a new history of the Ancestral World began. But this is another story.
