All right, we can hold position here if you and your foot patrol want to head down and investigate, Sergeant. Bloody nightmare. Right, you hold position up here, Corporal. Right, you three, come with me. A native warrior of the Wahehe. He is Ruga-Ruga. Well, he was working for the Germans, that's for sure. This is a Mauser. He was probably a scout, underestimated the grassland. With respect, sir, the Ruga are one with the land. They do not. Underestimate. Where is the gun crew? Rifles at the ready! Something I can do for you? - I was having a dream. - I was Joan of Arc, and I was wearing this brilliant armor, and I was riding a stallion. Where did that leave me? Oh, you were in a tower, locked away, reading a newspaper. And there was a fire-breathing dragon coming for you. How terrifying. Oh no, not at all. I rode in and slayed the dragon, but you had already left. How thoughtless of me. You went off drinking with a bunch of wild hyenas. You were laughing with them. You were laughing at me, actually. Ohh. That is awfully cruel of me and my hyena chums. Indeed, because there I was, left with this rather large disgusting dragon corpse. Well, you're a rather resourceful one. I'm sure you made the most of a loathsome situation. Well indeed, I did. You know, I have to say that I prefer to be the knight in shining armor, of course. Well, I prefer to be laughing at you. You have been in Africa far too long, love. And there's the dragon now. You really have been fantastic about all this, Anne, with your uncle and everything. Well, it's a fair price to be near Voi. And you, of course. Well, after I get my promotion, we'll move into officer housing in Voi and start a family again. It's, uh. Been a year since she passed. I have to go. I'm sorry. I miss her. Me too. We are healers, not soldiers. We are here to heal; That includes ourselves. One day we'll start a family again. I'm still not ready. I'm sorry. Let's review the facts in closing, shall we? Private Kamante, documents in the officer's vault went missing on your watch. You're lucky you're not tried for treason. Further, your accusations of British personnel's misconduct are implausible and unsubstantiated. You've heard the ruling of the court. Justice has been upheld, and now it will be served. Take him away. Yash. Sir. After we take care of the train business, we need to find the documents and account for all personnel at the hour in question. Yes, sir. And Yash, keep it quiet. - Yes, sir. - Like a moose, sir. Rigala, your mother's looking for you. She's about to leave on the train. Uncle, I just want to thank you so much again for everything you've done for me. You're dear and compassionate. I'll take the compliment. I'll also take this. And as a compassionate and reasonable man, I might ask how those traits extended toward the natives today. Harold's patrol went missing last night. Apparently, he made it to the rail line. Train brought him in. Is he all right? We'll see. He lost a patrol a few years ago. I looked for Harold, but he thought we abandoned him. Did you? Pawns aren't privy to know how the board is in play. I think an attack is coming. You may leave on the train for Voi, if you feel so inclined. - No, I choose to stay. - I have responsibilities here. Anne, your safety is far more important than that of these natives. Uncle, I would challenge you to approach the natives with respect. Yash, shoot that pest or something. Indeed, sir. - Come on. Let's go. - How can you treat - the natives like this? - Let's go. You think you've been here a while, do you? Try to extract civility from savages. It's an art you don't understand. Yash. I do not know how you tolerate that man. I'm stronger when you're here. Well, I'll be back in two weeks. Have to go. Look, the man that train has picked up was taken to my infirmary that I have let you operate. Now as a compassionate, reasonable man, as you said, I'll ask you to exercise an art you do understand: Nurse. Now. Dear. Yash. Now, Rigala, find your father while I'm gone taking the harvest to Voi. I'll be back in a few days. And don't be a burden to Miss Anne. She's very busy. Rigala. Mama, I love you. Harold. Does that hurt? Well, you're safe now. How many? Not many. They... they really took us by surprise. I'm... I'm sure the others made it. I'm certain they made it out. It's official now. War. We've just received a telegram. The line has been cut. I've my men checking the line now. - Right. - Well, if they're still alive, we don't have long to get to them, so heading south from the rail line won't do. Yash, ready a search party, light provisions, half-day round trip. - Yes, sir. - Signal 'Red Hammer'. Yes, sir. Anne. The soldiers will need medical attention. You'll be safe enough, yes? Sir, don't get me wrong, but there weren't many of them and it's a safe bet they were scouts. The Germans and the Rugas are on the move. Evacuating on the train to Voi might be a good idea. Sir. Right. My uncle isn't the most accommodating host. .As you may have noticed. But he has a kind heart. He took care of my family when my father died and helped arrange for me to work here at this -run resort. Right. Well, looks like I need to find a new spa to holiday at. Let me get you something for that. Yeah. Sir, it was right up here. Eh, these border raids are all too common. It was right here. This is where it happened? Anne, stay with me. Stay with me, Anne. Germans on the hill! Hold your fire. Red Hammer. - Red Hammer. - Yes. Do you see anything? Captain Lockwood. I didn't know you had employed the Masai. I should be cross with you, Chaka. I had a bone to pick with those men. We were having a disagreement of sorts. It seems that you have won, then, boss. Indeed. Well, this indicates a larger German presence than just the Rugas that attacked your patrol, Harold. We took this from a German officer. We scouted a dozen Rugas soldiers. They will move on the outpost and the pass this night. All right, we'll need more hands. How is the telegraph? - Still dead... - In both directions. Well, did the train get to Voi before it went dead? Yes. Your husband has arrived safely. All right, it's absolutely essential we get this cylinder to Voi Headquarters. The survival of the colony depends upon it. What's in the cylinder? Intelligence. German deployment plans all along the East African front, - and coding materials. - Do you mind! Secure the cylinder in the officers' vault under 24-hour guard. We'll put it on the train tomorrow. Yes, sir. Yash, bring those rifles. Gentlemen. You shall be released to fight. You will be given a weapon and my trust. You. Kamante. Translate. If you abuse that trust in the slightest, or turn tail and run, you will be shot dead. I'm watching you. You can see I won't hesitate to kill you should I grow suspect in the slightest. Yash. Anne, I want you taking a rifle. No. Excuse me, ma'am. Jim am be. Hi. Her mother is in Voi and I am to be on guard duty all night. I'll look after her for you. - She's happy. - -Me too. Come. Sit, Rigala. - Go on. - -Okay, Papa. I'm tired. Why don't you put your feet up here and relax. It's okay. Your father's - on watch all night. - -Hello, ma'am. Oh, come. Sit down. It hurts, badly. Oh, goodness. What happened to your hand? Sometimes people with power do harsh things for the wrong reasons. - Oh my god. - I think it's broken. Yeah. There's not much I can do for you. I'll bind it up. And you cannot move it for at least next week. I'm so sorry. It's nice having someone like you here. I'm glad I can help. My uncle really isn't a bad man. He just. He likes to show his power. Thank you. There we go. Keep it close to your heart, okay? There we go. Be careful. Yash, stay with me. All troops sound off! Yash, let's go! How the hell did they get in? They're setting fire to the town! They're headed for the ammo depot! We've got to get the cylinder! Come. Come, quick. Jamiya! Hold cover here! Papa! Papa! Nooo! Watch my daughter. Please. I promise. I promise. Go, go. We have to go! Come! Come. Outside! All right, where is everyone? They're dead. We can't hold this position! - Where's Anne? - -I don't know. We have to move! Dammit to hell! Let's go! Anne, you all right? I'm fine! All right, we've to get this cylinder to Voi Headquarters. We'll head for Mwatte, through the hill country. And her! - All right, let's go. - Go, go, go, go. - Come on. - Come on. This is not good. Rigala, I'm sorry. Why did you make me go? No one should have to see that. Your father isn't there anymore now, I'm afraid. I want to protect you. I promise I'll do my best. We'll make it to your mother in Voi. She'll be so happy to know that you're all right. It won't be the same. It won't. We'll make the best out of it. If you'll be strong for me, I'll be strong for you. Is that a promise? Come on. This means the enemy war party is already ahead of us and getting closer to Voi. We're the only ones that can stop them. Clearly. What now? A reinforcement train will head out from Voi Headquarters in three days when they haven't seen an inbound train or received a telegraph. Procedure. We can make for the old mine and on to Voi in three days. That's optimistic. I don't know, Yash. I think the little girl could do it in two. What are you waiting for? Alex will be on that train headed right into the ambush. Know your place. All together. Let's go. I will take her. Thank you. Let's go. No, thank you. You will be much faster below, and I can watch from up above. All right, Chaka, you go ahead this way. Your light! They will see it! What the hell is going on? - The native rushed me. - He wants water. - Stop. Enough. Young man. - -That is foolish. No! You will give us away! Don't doubt me. Pick up your rifle. Pick up your rifle. Fall in line. I will never see that behavior again. Problem? Not again, I should imagine. Fall in line. Dear God. Come on, darling. Ambush! Yash! I've got you. Chaka! Jammed! Anne, Harold, let's move! Come on. Let's go! I need help here! Eyes, up above. Hi, it's okay. It's okay. I need some help here! - Hi, it's okay. - No, it's okay. Uncle, Uncle, please. Anne. I need help here! Anne, he's mortally wounded. Hey, hey, look in my eyes. No, no, no, no, stay with me. Stay with me. No, no, no, no, no. Stay with me. Look at me. No, no, no, no. Come on. Oh my. Rigala, don't look. You all right? Hey, hey. That's it. Well, nothing could be done. It's no fault of yours. He needed help. Fine. Now your gun. Duma Kivali. Cheetah Shadow Tribe. The same that killed my family and attacked the outpost. He's yours to kill. No! Anne, enough. We're moving on. You can't just kill him. He's wounded. He's helpless. Granting him death is a luxury at this point. I'd like to take him aside and take him apart and see what he tells us. - Chaka! - You have a deranged sense of compassion. Look at his leg. He'll be lucky if he doesn't die. You're disturbed because you think I don't care about the private. I know a dead man when I see one. Well, then recognize a living man. He's your prisoner. And if you have any honor, you'll let me treat him. Corporal, get her out of the way. Captain. With respect, sir, we have a shield, all right? A warrior is valuable, and they'll attack again, all right? We can barter. I mean, it's slower, but it's safer. Good point, Corporal. Okay, wrap the devil up, Anne. He hasn't suffered properly for all the pain he's caused today. - Akuma. - I know. Okay. Ready. Hey. How was your week at the outpost, Doctor? Troop levels are strong. We should be well defended in the event of a German attack. - Good. - And Captain Lockwood? - Lockwood, sir. - Yes. Permission to speak freely, sir. Please. Lockwood is losing control. I do fear for the safety of the villagers, and more importantly, the troops under his command. Ah. I see, he's continued to be a distraction, yes? - Yes. - Are you prepared to take over? - Take over? - I'm going to be relying on you. Can you take charge? My duty, sir, is to King and country. I will do what I must. Very good. - Yes? - Sir. We've just lost contact with the outpost and with the rail line. - With the outpost, sir? - -Yes. Sir, with your permission, I'd like to take an expedition to the outpost to check on the safety of those there. Impossible. Procedure is we wait three days. You understand that. Sir, I understand procedure, but we are at war. Those are my orders, Doctor. Sir, my wife is at that outpost. Please, allow me to take a train down - to check on her safety. - -Yes, yes. - .And the safety of the... - .I understand your wife. We wait three days. Those are my orders! Tea? No, thank you. Sir. Why do you boss people around? Excuse me? Why do you boss people around? Why do I boss people.? 'Cause I'm the captain, dear. What's the captain? - The captain. - The captain is. Is the man in charge. What are you in charge of? I'm in charge of protection. What do you protect? We protect the people. We protect you, we protect Anne, we protect anyone who needs to be protected. You have all these because you're the captain? Because I'm the captain. Yes, that's right. I'm glad you're my friend, 'cause you're in charge. Well, thank you, dear. Where is Anne? We left Kamante's body in a hurry earlier. You might wanna say a few words. Less chatter. We are behind, as it is. He was not Christian. What's that, Yash? He was not Christian. He worshiped Nagai. Well, we should've respected what he would've wanted. Indulging all the heathen practices now, Anne? Pray to Guru Nanak, Yash? Or the Red God, Chaka? Don't harm the earth with my body if I die. I am no chief. Leave me to the birds in the sky. Should I die, do not bury me. The Sikh sanskar. The scattering of the ashes. There is no need to bury you, Yash. What would buzzards want with your curry-filled carcass? With all due respect, sir, not all of us find hell so appealing. But, Yash, you're the one who wants to burn. Get down. Hey. The water there looks good; Refill your canteens. Minimal rations. We have to last one more day. Make sure the little girl has enough. No. How did you learn how to do that? I helped my father clean the guns. Would you show me? Okay. Now me. Let's start with the basics, shall we? Here, do you see this point at the end of the gun? You line that up in between the sights. That's this right here. - You see this little "V"? - Mm-hm. You line that up so it's right between so it's even on the top. Even on the top. You have your target. Sighted. Now hold the gun up. Now, you're a righty. Here we go. All right, okay. Do not shoot Harold. Now, are they even? Is it smooth on top? Yes, it's in there. All right, very slowly squeeze the trigger. Don't jerk it, just squeeze it. Good, now what you have to do, because I noticed you went up and down, is when you shoot, you exhale. Whoooo. So you're still, still as night. Exhale. Fire. Chaka! What are you doing? I saw Harold move away from guarding the Ruga. Look! What is going on here? What's he talking about. I've got the Ruga right there! Why did you leave your post? I was gonna talk to Anne. I don't think she wants to talk. Right now. What the hell is going on here? Chaka, you're moving to relieve me. Take watch. - Hey, it's nothing. - Let's rest. Cylinder. All right, we rest now, and we move in a bit. Corporal. You hear something? It's nothing. As you were, soldier. That sounds like Yash! Chaka! Anne! Right. Scout the hill for us. Four Rugas sleeping by the fire. One guards them from the cliff above. All right, you head straight over there. You go around, I'll go straight through, right? Let's go. - Decoys. - Damn, I should have known. Oh. What? Yash. That's hot. Doesn't it hurt? I know you don't understand me, but you're going to be all right. I desire mercy for all, including you. Understand? Come on. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Where is Rigala? - I tried to shoot them, but they just took her. We have to go, now! - All right, come this way. - Come this way. - Don't you understand? - They just took her! We have to go, now! Yes, we do, and we have to be smart about it. Keep it down. Now, come this way through the canyon. We are not leaving her! Anne, look, be patient. We'll go after her. He always does this to me. Don't you start too. Rigala is in danger now. Not later, now! Anne, we'll get her back, all right? All right, look in my eyes. We'll go after her. They won't kill her, all right? We'll go after her. - Come on. - -Anne, now! Uncle, where are we going if we are not going after Rigala? Nearby there's an old mine. It's high and dry, and it will give us a tactical foothold. That's it, up there. The blasting store, and just beyond. Voi. Ah. Come on. Bring the girl. Ah. So, your idea of helping Rigala is hiding in a hole in the ground? An ostrich would be more heroic. Ostriches pack one hell of a kick, and now so do we. The blasting store: Rail line leftovers. If we are going to find Rigala, we've got to go soon. Don't let him trap you in the guise of safety. Chaka, get in here. Boss, I don't want to die in the ground. This is a white man's tomb. I will die with the sky above me. Sorry for the dire conditions, but clearly, it's safer in here. And we can make use of all this blasting material. Besides, there's nothing you can't fix with enough explosives. Rigala isn't in here. Don't endanger the very people that are trying to help you. Now do the honorable thing. In. The honorable thing would be to keep your word and go after her. She's not some pawn in your game here. What are you trying to prove? That you can protect her? Chaka, get in here. Look, I'll talk to her. Just... just... give me some time. When she comes in, Chaka will come too. He's a stubborn Masai. Maybe just go ahead and scout for a bit. All right, keep watch outside for the time being. Of course, sir. Come on, Chaka. There are a great many caves in these hills. The Rugas may know them. I don't know if I could ever stand up to him like that. It was brave, the way you handled him. Oh, it wasn't bravery. If anything, it was just festering anger on my part. You're to thank. No, it was you. See, you stood up and held your ground. That's what a leader does. I'm no leader. That's Lockwood. He is just trying to keep us safe. Gosh, I shouldn't have talked to him like that. But you were right, Rigala. Rigala's not here. Would he be content with us all just leaving her? Well, he has the bigger picture in mind. Troops at Voi, the cylinder, - it all has to get to... - And despite that, he disregards your responsibility for her, doesn't he? - Well yes, but he... - He feels responsibility for me. So, he won't risk leaving you, even to go after her? Right. And he won't send you or any of us, so. So then what? I always thought compassion alone would save us. Isn't this an act of compassion? We have to do something, but after they took Yash, I just don't know. Maybe it's too late. I just. I will stand with you whatever you decide to do. - What? - Just us go after her? What, you don't think you could fight them? Or that I could? - I don't know. - I'm sure you could. But, don't be offended, you haven't been able to kill one yet. Ahhhh. Well, that's a challenge I'm willing to take. And like you said: Before it's too late. - No but. Voi. - My husband. No, this is mad, we shouldn't, this is... - Yeah, yeah, of course. - You're right. Okay, let's just... Just stay here. I'd be betraying my uncle. He doesn't know what it's like to lose a daughter. Got to get her back to her mother. I'm behind you in this. We won't come back without her. I promise. Let's go on. - Chaka. - Mm. Quite a journey we took today. Yes, quite the journey. I must say I respect you for understanding what it means to be a true warrior. Well, thank you, Chaka. We have a tradition in the civilized world, it's called handshake. And when you respect a man and/or you want to pass on affection, you shake their hand as such. Take it. Grasp it. Shake it. I shake your hand, Chaka. You have my respect. That is called handshake? That's called a handshake. That is handshake. You have my respect and my affection. Respect and affection, that is nice. Now, where I come from, when we respect somebody, our most prized possession that we give is a cow. Mmm, nice. So. We could use a cow about now, couldn't we? Yes, we could use a cow. We could use many cows. Yes, we could. Many cows! Yes. Big mess, Chaka. Why did Anne refuse the gun so strongly earlier? When her daughter died of smallpox, she decided she'd prove her worth. Resume nursing, see if she could stave off death from others or something. Just heal, no hurt. Can't she have another child? Well, it's not really about that, you see. Keep quiet, okay? No! Would you please explain it? She has to prove something to herself. You see, it's her own personal hell. She'll burn in it if she loses that little girl too. Just stay behind me, okay. I'll protect you. Let's hurry. Have you any idea where you are going? Okay, I think Rigala called out from around here. Look, water comes down from these two caverns, and they must converge ahead. If you think another cavern would be better, I'll follow you. - All right, fine. - Let's go. Come on. - Hey. - -Why so fast? - Stay quiet. - Surprise is on our side. I can barely see a thing! Okay, watch your head. Up there. All right. I need you to wait here, okay? I saw another way back there. I'm gonna... gonna take it. It might be a shortcut, might take us further. I'll be right back. - No, no. - No, you can't just leave me. I can barely see a thing. The way through is right there. Anne, you'll be fine. - This is the center. - You'll be fine. Okay? If there's a safer way to get Rigala out, - we should take it. - No. Let me go with you. You'll be fine. Please. Ooohh. Oh, Chaka. Harold! Ah, there you are. Anne has headed off. - Where'd she go? - She felt like she had to find Rigala. We... we have to go after her. Of course, we do. Why did you let her go off on her own? I tried to stop her, but I-I couldn't find you. What the hell does that have to do with anything? We're just over there! Which way did she go? I'm not sure exactly. I-I didn't see after she headed off. You didn't see which way she headed? - No. - And you didn't see us just over there. What the hell did you see? I'm sorry, this is my fault. All right? I know you wouldn't let something like this happen. Hell, no. - All right. - We should go after her. Hell, yes! - To find my girl. - Okay, then. Unfortunately, we have no idea where to start looking out here, do we? Well. She may be overly optimistic and ambitious, but she's not an idiot, much less suicidal. No, of course not. She wouldn't head off on her own. Or think she could take the Rugas on by herself. I don't know what to say. You don't know what to say? You know, I-I could show you where she went, and-and. I thought you didn't see where she went. Not exactly. Look, I-I should have been clearer. The hills are many. Lots of looking. All right, I saw where she was headed. And-and now that I think of it, there is only one place. It's just-it's right down there. - Right. - Let's move then. And I think one of us should stay here with the cylinder. No. Chaka, bring it. We all go, Harold. Now. We're off. Major, no surprise seeing you here. Harold, hold your fire. We don't want to alert them to our presence yet. Chaka, watch the rear. Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Noo! - No. - -Noo! Noo! Boss, look. Oh, Anne. Anne! Anne. Anne, we're here. Harold, get back here. Oh, my god. Captain Lockwood, we have to move! Let's go, let's go! They're coming! They're coming! They're right behind me! - Chaka, no. - Follow me! It's a shame we have to leave her. Well, at least we made it back. You know, I took out a few of them back in the cave. - Really? - Didn't manage to see that. Where's the cylinder? Harold took it. What!? I-I don't have it. I must have lost it back in the fight. Lost it in the fight? Okay, look, I'll get it back. We can... we can go out there, or... I've got it. Don't move an inch. Anne. "O supreme light, lead us from untruth to truth, "from darkness to light, from death to immortality." You were a good friend, Yash. Are you going to confront Harold. Or am I going to kill him? One day, we'll start a family again. I'm still not ready. It's been, been a year since she passed. I miss her. Watch my daughter, please. I promise. I promise. He doesn't know what it's like to lose a daughter. Let's start again. What are you doing?! This isn't a tribunal, Harold. We know you're working with them. Why should I, why would I? When you took the plans from the officer's vault to hand over to the Germans, you pinned the blame on Kamante. That was only your first act of treason. You then walked us straight into the sniper's ambush and helped them burn down the outpost. And when Kamante was on to you, you had him killed, and then Yash. Treason? You sent us out. You abandoned me. We were bait. You shouldn't have come back on that train, and when you did, I would have shot you dead. Then trade me for the cylinder. You won't get it back otherwise. - Boss. - I'd rather you die. Boss. What, Chaka? What? He is mad. He speaks nonsense. - No, Chaka. - We used him as bait. When the Germans began their border raids, I sent him out with false information. It was essential the Germans not know about the rail line openings. I want you to lose everything! They will not give it back. He is setting us up again. You're right, Chaka. We aren't getting it back. We've got a problem. One way out. Kifari, guard the cylinder. I will gather the others, and we will go. - Let's go. - I can keep you safe. Come on. You really expect me to wear a sack filled with explosives. Are you mad? It's simply our guarantee that you comply with your end of the bargain. If not, I shoot. Bam. No way in hell. The deal was me for the cylinder. I make the terms. You have nothing without me. Have it your way then. Fine! Fine! Pack. On. You think I don't know what you're doing? No? You don't think they'll follow through. You're going to send me down there, get near the cylinder, and then trigger the sack. I like the way you think. But they'll follow through, and so will you if you want to stay alive. You're setting me up for a trap. I'm don't think I'm going go through with it. I'm not getting killed. Ah, you're a clever one. We've got a smart one here, eh, Chaka? Mm. All right, I'll wear the sack for you to the mid-point of the ravine. I'll yell up to them, explain the deals of the trade. All right. Alright, move. Keep walking. I saw you stuff the sack with sand. Blow it all to hell. Boss! It is lit! We have to go. Oh God. - Anne! - You left me in there! - I'm sorry. - Run! Anne! They're coming, we have to go! - Run! - Just wait. - What are you doing? - Get off of me! Hey, hold. They're right behind me! We have to go! Ah. Bloody hell. Ah! This way. She's not going to make it. Grab my hand. Over the top, all of you! Hurry! Go! Go! Go! That's enough, dear. Harold was working for the Germans. When the first patrol he was on was taken prisoner, he was reconditioned by them. He turned and formed a vendetta against me. He was always so dramatic. I saw more Rugas in the cave before we blew the mine. Didn't get them. I think they have the cylinder. - I know. - I almost had it. Must go back. What? In there? Anne, they have the German attack plans. They'll massacre every innocent person at Voi just like they did at our outpost. I know. All right, you ladies will head up to the peak, and we'll meet up with you. Come on. Chaka. I lost the cylinder to Harold. I will go alone. - No, Chaka, no. - We all go together. I am young and strong. I will approach them silent, fast, alone. Chaka, it doesn't matter how you approach them, they will kill you. They killed my family. Protect what you have. Head to the high peak, boss. I must go. Yeah. Just gonna let him go? We have to keep moving, Anne. Defend yourself. It is only metal. But it can break. But you have something stronger than it can ever be. You have a great tool, something that can not be broken. It will overcome any enemy. What? What do I have? You have compassion. I was quite proud of you today, Anne. Thank you, Uncle. Yes, you reminded me a bit of your mother. Really? Yes, you did. Well, when we were children, yes, your uncle Edward, I believe was 12, he could swim.. - Mm-hm. - I was five, I couldn't swim, and your mother was four. Well, your grandfather was not the most sensitive human being on the planet. And um, he had Edward in the water, egging us on. "Come on, Andrew. Come on, Andrew." So, I was scared, but they threw me in towards Edward. I sank, of course. They rescued me. And then they grabbed your mother, threw her in. She screamed bloody murder, lands in the water, splash. Still. She popped up and swam away. - Not a joke. - Four years old? Mm. Four years old. She was so proud of you, the day you made captain. Ah? She couldn't stop talking about you. - Really? - -Mm-hm. Mm. What did she say? She said you were her hero. Really. How kind of her. And she said you couldn't swim. Never could. She was right about that, Anne. Well, there's time to learn still. I'll teach you. Of course. Bwana! I have the cylinder. I'm coming to you. Follow me! Rigala, climb above, and stay right there. I'll be along in just a moment. Go, go! - Ooh. - I had no idea how steep it got. It did not look this far from down there. Chaka! It's too far. No time, boss. Agh! Boss! - Uncle. - Oh, I'm sorry, Anne. - No, no. - Here, let me help you. I'm getting old and sloppy. - No! - I am stuck now. - No, I'm here for you. - We'll figure this one out. We'll get out of this together. Thanks, Anne. You'll be going, you'll be going on without me. No, we'll figure something out. We'll figure something out. Anne, why don't you start by getting the cylinder. It's right there. Here. I'll get Rigala. We can hide out here for a while. Right, you've got to get that child to safety in Voi now, dear. I don't even know where I'm going. Anne, Chaka was leading the way. Voi, it's right up the path. He said you can't miss it. Fine, but you're the one who's gotten us through, every step of the way. Anne, you've been pushing ahead to get to Voi ever since we saw the train was ambushed. Fine, but we're gonna hide out. We can hide out, right. We can just... let's just... Anne, I wanted to hide out at the blasting store, and you wouldn't sit by for that, so don't start now. We'll figure something out. We'll figure something out. Anne, I'm bleeding inside. I can feel it. Let me die defending the troops at Voi on my own terms. We'll figure something out. Anne. They'll be here soon. You must go. No, no. Don't let the pain of the past take more from you. I will miss you, Anne. Go. Go, dear. Go. All right. Son of a bitch. Be right there. Drop the rifle, British! All I want is the cylinder! Every one of your men, dead! Be reasonable. Or she dies! Rigala, take this! It's too heavy! I need you to go ahead as fast as you can to Voi. And when you get there, give Alex or one of the officers the cylinder, and they'll know what to do. Okay? I'll be right after you. I promise. I know you're not coming. You're going to stay and fight like Lockwood. Promise me you'll make it. Promise! - I promise. - I promise. Okay? Now you have to run! Go! Anne, I'm sorry it's gotten like this. I am going to let you and Rigala go. Really. I don't want to hurt you. My fight's been with Lockwood and the British, not you. Just put the sword down! Well, then your fight is with me as well. Don't be a dispensable pawn for them, Anne. I know about your lost patrol, Harold. The first one. They left us to die. Lockwood. Lockwood left us to die. You blamed my uncle. You decided he abandoned you. Anne. Don't you dare try to share your vendetta with me. - You can walk away. - You don't have to fight. You thought compassion would save us. This is what it looks like. Come back with us to a new East Africa. You... You are a liar and a murderer! Well, we stopped the train from heading into an ambush and prevented a massacre. We'll be ready and able to defend this village, so this won't happen again. - Ah, there she is. - Rigala. My daughter. My daughter, Rigala. Rigala. - Mommy! - My daughter. My daughter, Rigala. Oh! Oh, my daughter. My daughter. I had no idea you were alive. Let... let's go. Come on. We just got here. I just heard. I hardly recognize you. Let's start again. Really? Yes.
