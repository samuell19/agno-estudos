Come on, quickly, ask for forgiveness. Who are you? David. King David? Where's the tape that I used? Are you fasting, David? Prove it. Why did you turn on the light? You're ruining it for everyone. Go away. Have a meaningful fast and good night. And don't come back. Illuminate my path. Illuminate my path. Illuminate my path. I told you to go home. Yaish! You're late. How's the fast going? Thank God. You're a righteous man. King David. He roams around the neighborhood every Yom Kippur. I've never seen him before, only on Yom Kippur. I don't know anything about him except that his name is Yaish. He's taken a vow of silence, you know? Sometimes I see him from my window and I go downstairs... I used to ask him questions, I'd try to get some words of sanctity out of him. But Yaish is a higher spirit. He doesn't say a word until the Shofar is blown. But I no longer ask questions, thank God. So we just keep quiet. Can you see the light around him? You're a quiet type, too. You could also take the vow of silence. Have you tried? You know, the greatest righteous people are... Please move. -I'm not moving. Please, it's important. What's important? I'll stand here until morning, I have nothing better to do. Go take a walk with Yaish. I have a more important Mitzvah here to do. Today, God decides who lives and who dies. So, let Him decide. Stop playing this game. Leave us alone, go to another building. I'm staying here. Why? The sin is not on me. Good night, King David. Why are you awake? Tell me, how long have you been like this? Like what? Like this. Can I ask you something? You said you know everything. Yes... but I want to ask you. What do you think of me? May you be blessed. "Who is this that appears like the dawn, "fair as the moon, "bright as the sun, "majestic as the stars in procession?" Why are you awake? Song of Songs. Smart boy. -Why are you awake? I'm not allowed to sleep for the entire fast. Why? Sins of the past. You don't have to suffer more than others. It doesn't really matter. Who said? Shimoni at... at the synagogue. Are you suffering? I'm tired. You don't live on Keren Hayesod, I don't know you. Did you go to all of the buildings on this street? Why do you do that? To see. Who? Don't you have enough faith, David? It's okay, you have something more important. You have a good heart. Faith is not enough if you don't have a good heart, right? Illuminate my path. Illuminate my path. Illuminate my path. I won't sin again, give me a chance. Turn on the light. Come here, I want to show you something. You know, David, up until a few years ago... I lived in this world, certain I was alone. I thought there was nothing but me. One big nothing. I was lonely and I didn't even know I was lonely. I thought that this was it, it is what it is. What nonsense. And then I saw Him. Suddenly, out of the blue, nothing turned into everything. You saw Him? Yes. Where? Right here. He just waited for me and suddenly I saw Him. I remember how he came to me and said, "Come along," so I did. Where? Look at the light bulb. There, in the light. That's how He came to me. I was nearly blinded. And what did you say to Him? Nothing. I didn't have to say a thing. I just went. What if I can't see anything? Stop asking questions. Look. Blessed are You, Lord, who has granted us life, sustained us and enabled us to reach this occasion. I call to You, I cling to You, Until I return to my land, While I still live I am Yours, And even after my death, I admit and confess before You, For my sins and my wickedness, My salvation is Yours, forgive my wickedness, my crimes and my guilt, I bow and spread my hands to You, Please hear my supplication, I cry with a downtrodden heart to You, With my many complaints and my grief, Kindness is Yours, mercy Yours Have mercy on all my hardship My sin is too great to bear My lapses too large...
