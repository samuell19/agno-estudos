My wrath bristles through my helmet the rain stops as I stand by the rail I look up towards the sky and let loose a passionate roar. My deeds are nothing but dust at 30 my journey took me many miles under the sky. So do not sit by idly for young men will grow old in regret. The shame of Jing Kong still lingers When will the pain ever end? Let us ride our chariots through the Helan Pass There we shall feast and drink barbarian flesh and blood. Let us recover our stolen lands before paying tribute to the Heavens.
