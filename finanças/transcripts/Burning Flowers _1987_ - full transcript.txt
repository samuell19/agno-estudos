I wasn't christened Rosa. It's my stage name You know, when I was young... was my hair like a bonfire. Like a flame That's why they called me Rosa. My real name is Sigrun but I couldn't use that.

What about the Dutch ones? What are you thinking about? Nothing. That's not possible. What? Think about nothing. Like I said, it's impossible. You try. How do you do it? Sit like this. - Like that? Now shut your eyes. Okay. I did it. - You didn't think about anything? - No. Are you quite sure? One thing that wouldn't go away... A little elephant in the corner. You're kidding around. Did you get a key to your room? No. Britt's having a party after the exams. Have you been with many girls? - Why do you ask about that? - I was just wondering. A few. - Don't you dear to say? - Sure. Three. I guess it will be four then. Bye. What a surprise! Are you working overtime? - I'm not delivering flowers today. - No, I know. No! Not there! I'm glad you came. Have you got visitors? No. I'm just celebrating a special day. Are you always alone? Yes. How do yo pass the time? You get used to it. Time passes on its own. I just sit here and notice the time passes by. You haven't always been alone? Is it disgusting to see an old woman drinking alone? No... I haven't always been alone. But it was a long time ago. People were everywhere. Too many at times. Couldn't get time for me self. There were always... performances, parties, travels. So now I've got time to myself. What did you do abroad? I was an trapeze artist. There was myself, a Spaniard and two Germans. I wasn't afraid. I never was because... Bruno, one of the Germans, who was really from Italy.. Had such strong arms. Like two steel cables. He caught me up high. I didn't shut my eyes, so I saw everything It was like a dream. The drum-rolls... The public... I was never afraid with Bruno. He took me.. And suddenly was I standing on the platform, listening to the applause. After that.. So much happened. We traveled all over Europe. "Cirque d'Hiver". That's where I got the name Rosa. Rosa. That's my name. Bruno's arms... His hands... I can still feel them taking hold of me... the split second before we met... It was as if our arms and hands were fused. I slowly floated up to the platform. Like this. This is how he held me. Like this. Where's Bruno now? We got married in Munich in December 1938. It was so cold. We wore thick furs on the way to the church. And out clown, a little Polish guy... he had such strange eyes. He wanted to sprinkle sawdust on the church floor. Very good, Herman. Herman, it's for you. It's Unni. Hello. Hi. No. I can't tonight. I have to study math and the rest. Okay. Bye. Where are you going? To the movies. - What are you going to see? - I don't know yet. Bye. I didn't expect you back. I can do your shopping and leave it at your door. No, thank you. That's not necessary. I'm so tired nowadays. I'm not sleeping well. I lie awake thinking. Is there much snow outside? No, not very much. I can't think of anything more unsavory than snow. December is the worst month of the year. Why do you come here? What do you want? I'm sure you have a lot of friends and a girlfriend. Why do you visit me? I like talking to you. And listening to you. The others just talk about nothing. - Sorry. I didn't... - It doesn't matter. I intended to show it to you anyhow. Did you know I'd come back? Look. Copenhagen in the spring. My debut with the circus. What happened afterwards? Afterwards? Yes, after you'd been to that hospital? Did I tell you that? I'm so clumsy. Hang on and I'll dry you off. These hand of mine... I can't control them. They slip away from me. What will your mother say? - You haven't told anyone? - No. - You mustn't tell anyone about me. - No. Where were we, Herman? You said you went into a... You were in a sanatorium. Oh, yeah That's right. Next to a beach. I used to walk there. A sandy beach. Several miles long It was always foggy. The summer houses were shut. Ant the war was on. Isn't it strange? A full-scale war was on and I didn't notice a thing. I just waited for Bruno. Bruno became a soldier. He sent me a photograph. I never saw him again. I died in the war too. But I only noticed it afterwards. Go home now, Herman. Can't you hear me? Go home! Herman! - Where have you been? - At the movies. - You're lying! - I've been at the movies. - What's that on your jumper? - I don't know. And who would know? It smells like gin. - Have you been drinking? - No. Someone at the movies spilt a bottle over me. I don't know what it was. You needn't keep secrets from me. Have you gone home already, Herman? I think he's gone home. Can any of you see him? I can't seem to. Would you give us a little sound? A little sign of life so we know where you are? No, no, no! Remain quiet and seated while I collect your papers. And no talking! Herman, wait! Don't you have time to talk to me? - I have to work. - You're always busy. I study at night. Are you going to the party? I'll try. I saw you that night... you wouldn't come out. You were running and looked stupid. - I had to deliver flowers. - That suddenly? Everyone wants flowers around Christmas Sometimes I'm not home before 10. Then say so instead of lying. I've got a room key now. Where have you been? Delivering flowers. It's past ten, and you haven't eaten yet. I'm not hungry. I said I'd be late. You could have rung. You know where I was. Should I ring half-hourly? Don't be a smartass. It's good that you work and earn money. But we still get anxious. I rang the florist over an hour ago. And they said you'd left! Yes, with four deliveries. One of them miles away. - Have you been smoking? - No, I've delivered flowers. Herman, don't lie to us! I'm not. Do you want to see the receipts? What do you really do in the evenings? Willy has rung and asked for you. What's happening to you? Hi. - Going to the liquor store? - Yeah, we are. The queue's not that damn long. Good. - Want another? - Okay. Cheers, Willy. Cheers, boys. I told my folks. I'm staying over with you. I said that too. What? - That I'm staying with you. - I hope they don't check. Hi! When did you arrive? I've been here all along. I didn't see you. I sat right there in lounge room. Me too. Cheers! What is it, Herman? What do you mean? You seem so strange. - It's nothing in particular. - It got to be something. I'm with someone else. You're rotten! - Have you been drinking much? - A little. I'm not drunk Would you like one? I hardly recognise you, Herman. - Where have you been? - To a school party. - So you're stopped by on your way home? - I'm not going home. What happened to Bruno? Happened? I never saw him again. He was probably killed in action. And then you left the circus. I should have. But the manager persuaded med to stay. Everything had changed. The old one's had gone. Bruno and out clown and everyone... There was a new troupe. We no longer traveled from one town to another. We went to military camps along the front... entertaining the soldiers. The German soldiers. I had to find Bruno! It was my only hope to one day find him among half-dead mutiladed men. Boys sat on benches staring at me... laughing. I still remember those laughs. It was full of fear. The soldiers weren't much older than you. Two trucks carried out out gear And when we.. Arrived, it always smelled of wet soil. It was always raining. I sat up front and saw soldiers along the road. Sometimes I thought... I was almost sure.. I got the driver to stop I ran out... But when he turned around it was always somebody else. And then the laughed. I wore high heels. There was mud everywhere. Mud and blood. Fred Astaire entertained the Americans. I became afraid. I knew it would happen. It was as if I knew. I threw myself off the trapeze. He was too late. I felt his fingernails scratch me And then I fell. I could never perform again. That's my story. Now you must go. Can I stay here tonight? Is that why you came? How did Bruno hold you? - Did I scare you? - No. I'm ugly, aren't I Don't you even want to look at me? Yes. I have to go now. Herman... Your father and I overslept. My dear Herman... Did you have a good time? Want yo go skiing with me today? I don't think so. - Have you had breakfast at Willy's? - Yes. You can't go around with fingers like that. Go wash them. Herman! Have you locked your door? Herman.. Unlock it! Herman! You.. Many thanks! Christmas is a special time.. Where we live in peace with ourselves and others. But it's also a time to remember the four H's. The cornerstones of our lives. The four H's are... A good heart, good health, able hands and a bright head. But we got to remember there's a time after Christmas too. - What happened to you at the party? - I went home. I felt Britt's boobs. Inside her bra. Do you hear me? Yes. - Cheers, Hermansen! - Cheers, Osvaldsen! I'd like to buy some flowers. My dear, you can have some. Isn't this one nice? Yes. But I'd prefer those. Daisies? But they are summer flowers. I'd like them anyway. And a rose - Like that? - Lovely. Are they for your girlfriend? There you are. How much? - You can have them. - I want to pay. Ten kroners? If you absolutely insist. Five, not a penny more. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Cheers. My hair was like a red flame... because Bruno... He caught me up high... I didn't shut my eyes, so I saw everything. It was like a dream. The drum-rolls... The public... Like this. This is how he held me. Have you told anyone about me? English translation by MKej for KG.
