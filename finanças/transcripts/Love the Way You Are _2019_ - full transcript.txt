When do you start liking someone? Once upon a time... Are you stupid? You're such a baby. All you know is crying. Hold back your tears! Stop bullying her. It's none of your business. What are you doing? Watch this. I was seven then. The best student in our town. Does she have mental problems? She's smiling foolishly again. Yes, she's been standing there all afternoon. Why am I a good student? First, I'm athletic. I often run happily with my buddies. Second, I'm popular. I get on well with the old people in our town. All the old grandmas and grandpas would praise me Hanging around all day. Your mom is going to beat you again. Third, I'm kind. As the sole appointed heir of our family's general store, I would rob from the rich to help the poor. I would help those in need. I'm charitable. This is for you. Here, you can have it. This is me, Zhou Linlin. In the flesh. A good student. When did his dream end? He turns off the alarm. Starts another day like always. How should we interpret Bai Juyi's line Silence is more powerful than sound? Zhou Linlin. Busy working. Busy making money. What should I eat for breakfast? Ordinary people keep the world running. Let me try. The sweat on your body becomes a rainbow. I win! Your daughter Linlin never studies. Zhou Linlin! Go study! Go study. Go study! Why should I study? What good will it do me? Drowned out by the crowd, Eating lunch is his happiest time of the day. I've already accepted my fate. How can someone who will carry on my family's business take my mom seriously when she is playing mahjong? Another day of work ends like always. Another day of work ends like always. Come here. Look at Fang Yuke across the street. He gets the top score on every test. The House of a Bookworm Fang Yuke, the worst student in our town. Why is he the worst student? First, he's not popular. He's always trying to steal the limelight. Second, he's not passionate about anything. Except for studying. Third, he lacks emotional intelligence. Every day he upsets my mom. Come here. From now on, you do what Fang Yuke does. When he stops studying, you stop studying. Hey! Can you turn off your light please?! Are you an owl?! Don't you need to sleep?! You aren't sleeping either! Stop yelling! It's the middle of the night! Four-eyed, steel toothed, stinky-faced monster. Fang Yuke, go back to Mars! You're not welcome on Earth! One morning, I came up with a crazy plan. Do you want an apple? Sure. Could it be that my life is really descending into darkness? Ye Ruting, I want to be your boyfriend. Fang Yuke, this Friday night do you want to watch a movie together? Ye Ruting Ye Ruting, the "school flower". Both beautiful and talented. She's known as the "harvester of nerds" There's a saying. If you want a nerd to turn off his light, then you must make him fall in love. I don't think Fang Yuke can resist her. There is a rumor going around our school that the "nerd" and the "school flower" are dating. It looks like my plan is about to succeed. I'm free! His light is off. His light has been off for a week. I can live my own life again! But it seems like he wasn't studying that night. Did something happen between him and Ye Ruting? Not long after that, Ye Ruting changed school, and I had to study with him again. Not only that, he studied later and later every night. Lishui High School China Eastern University Zhou Linlin It was because I have to follow Fang Yuke's every move, and study diligently that bad student like me, the daughter of general store owner, was able to test into the best school in the country. But Fang Yuke didn't do as well as he should have. Although he got into China Eastern University too, he was placed in the Department of Animal Husbandry with me. Two brilliant students from a small city got accepted to China Eastern University Fang Yuke, we live so close together but it seems we never really hung out that often. I had no time. I had to study. With your talent, it's a pity you got stuck in the Husbandry Department. It's fine. Once I enter China Eastern, I can major in two departments. Wow. I know you're a really good student, but it will be hard having a double major. It's OK. Why don't you just switch departments? Are you going to switch? Me? I just thank god I got in at all. Although I don't know why I got into Animal Husbandry, there must be a reason for it. I'm gonna go there, and find the meaning in my life. China Eastern, I'm here! You guys are new students. Hello. I'm Xie Duanxi from the Life Sciences Department. You can call me Xiao Xi. Hello Xiao Xi, I'm Zhou Linlin from the Animal Husbandry Department. It's nice to meet you. Linlin, you're very cute. Thank you. And this is...? My name is Fang Yuke. We're from the same town. We both tested into the Husbandry Department. Childhood sweethearts. Even better. What? If I'm able to win your heart away from your childhood sweetheart, it's an even greater accomplishment. You don't understand. We're just from the same town, not childhood sweethearts. In that case, let's hang out some day. See you then. See you later. Hello, I'm Zhou Linlin. This This is the most popular spicy strip from my family's store. This is also very popular. Have some. Hi, there. Da Bai. My name is Xu Jier. I was transferred in the Husbandry Department. Jier! This is for you. I don't eat that kind of stuff. Give it to Da Bai. I have gifts for you. Da Bai, give them some of those essential oils. OK. Hurry up! Come here! Linlin, look! Awesome! Here. This is for you. Hello. Hello. A robot! Cool! Waiting for me? What's up? You dropped your books. Can you help me study every day for the entrance exam? Ruting, see you tomorrow after school. I have something to tell you. Fang Yuke, it is you. You haven't changed at all. I knew you would test into China Eastern too. Yeah. What department are you in? We are in the animal Husbandry Department. Yuke, she is...? Ye Ruting, you surely don't remember me. I'm Zhou Linlin. We were in the same high school. But you left our junior year. I'm really happy to meet you here. Hello, hello. I'm really happy to see Yuke here. And... Zhou Linlin! What a coincidence. She's my roommate, and you guys are old classmates. Fang Yuke was once...? Jier! This is Ruting. She's really beautiful and popular. She gets love letters every day. I'm going to class. Let's go. I gotta go. It was nice meeting you all. Bye bye. See you later. Hello new Animal Husbandry students. Can you all smell that natural odor in the air? Look to your left. Can you see her? That's Mary. It smells bad. She's our school's nicest cow. Below my feet is the grass that they eat. Every day I come here and talk to them. It makes every day wonderful. This smell is actually nice. Hey! Why are you standing so far away? OK, everyone. Let's give a warm welcome to the head of the Animal Husbandry Department. Professor Zhang, can you say a few words? Welcome everyone. There are a lot of you this year. That's a good sign. I want to ask you all, why do you want to study animal husbandry? Tell me. It doesn't matter. Whatever, I don't care. My parents already have a job lined up for me. They just want me to have a diploma. I got transferred here. I'm going to switch departments soon. I'm going to join China Eastern's most famous department. Life Sciences. I'm going to become a famous performer, but before that happens, I should probably switch departments too. Animal Husbandry doesn't really fit the life of a celebrity. It seems like a lot of you want to change departments. Every day I work with the livestock. It's a dirty and strenuous job, but if there weren't people like us, how would people drink fresh milk, and eat healthy meat. I hope that all of you some day can find meaning in this discipline. Orientation Ceremony Biology & Agriculture Department Excuse me. Xiao Xi! What a coincidence. Last time, you bumped into me. This time, I bumped into you. I'm sorry. It's fate. You... Are you going to roast a sheep? No! I'm going to perform a folk dance. OK. Oh yeah. Can I ask you a huge favor? When I'm on stage, remember to cheer me on. OK. If I'm able to put a smile on your face, I'll feel so lucky. OK. Sit there. OK. Sit. OK. Are you performing today? It's a secret. Fang Yuke, is someone sitting here? Yes. It's cool. I'll sit behind you. Our welcome party for the Biology and Agricultural Schools is about to begin. Thank you Xiao Xi for that wonderful performance. Do you think Xiao Xi is hot? Yes! Do you like him? Yes! You must be Ruting from the Life Sciences Department. I'm Wei Feng from the Animal Husbandry Department. Do you have a boyfriend? Nobody worth mentioning. You're blocking the people behind you. Sorry. Yangtze River, Yangtze River. You use your deep bends... Thank you. Rolling ever eastward... Why are you putting your arm around me? Because you're my girlfriend. It's probably better if I sing a song for you. Listen. The sound of the weeping sea... Why did you say I'm your girlfriend? I'll tell you. As long as we're at China Eastern, you are my girlfriend. Oh. OK then, let's go. Wait, but why? Jier! What? I want to ask you something. You went to high school with Ruting. Do you know before she changed to your school what happened between her and Fang Yuke? Back in high school, Fang Yuke was in love with Ruting. First he invited her to a movie. After that, he kept asking her out. I don't know if they were ever actually dating. Anyway, Fang Yuke seems like a nerd. Ruting could never like him. I'm sure she dumped him. Dumped him? Sorry, You're a nice guy, but we're not a good fit. Wait a second. After I sent the love letter and the movie tickets, Fang Yuke actually fell in love with Ruting, but Ruting changed schools, and just dumped him. I never thought fate would bring them together here. He's just saying I'm his girlfriend to piss off Ruting. Everything is clear now! To tell the truth, this is all my fault. What should I do? Linlin. Did you and your childhood sweetheart finally make it official? Fang Yuke? He's really not my childhood sweetheart. He's just my neighbor since we were kids. We barely even knew each other. That just means he was secretly in love with you. No, no, no. It's not like that. He could never like me. He likes... Forget it. I've already caused him enough trouble. I need to keep his secret. Anyway, I swear there's nothing going on between us. He was just making a stupid joke yesterday. He likes to joke around. I know. If I found out you were actually dating someone else I would be sad. Bye bye. This isn't the time to think about this. How can I actualy help Fang Yuke? Ruting! Right. Ruting! I need to talk to you. What are you so worked up about? It's nothing. Ruting, I want to tell you something. You probably don't know me, but I know a lot about you. You were the most popular girl in school. You were smart and pretty, so all the guys liked you. So Fang Yuke, he... So... You are worried about Fang Yuke liking me before. Relax. That's all in the past. No, I don't care about that. Don't worry. Really. You and Fang Yuke are a good match. Us? How are we a good match? You just are. I'm going to class. Hold on a second. I came here to tell you that Fang Yuke really likes you. Don't misunderstand him. Next week is my birthday. I want you and Yuke to come. Bye bye. I really don't know what Zhou Linlin wants. The way she just talked to you, is that a demonstration? Or maybe Fang Yuke is using Zhou Linlin to make you jealous. Like I said, how could a guy who likes Ruting fall in love with a girl like Zhou Linlin. Fang Yuke is acting a little weird. He must be angry. After all, I didn't even say bye to him before I changed school. In terms of digestive absorption and metabolism, stomachus compositus digestion is an important physiological feature of ruminant animals. The majority of ruminant animals have four compartments in their stomachs. No. I must help Fang Yuke regain his confidence, and win back Ruting. What are you doing? Why are you always staring at me? What? Are you infatuated with my face? Narcissist! Idiot! I have a question. Do you do what your girlfriend says? It depends. Next week is Ruting's birthday party. Will you go with me? Sure. If you want to go. But... What? I think... I think you need some new clothes. You should wear something nice if you're going with Linlin. You don't want to embarrass her. Right. You should do that. OK. I know I told you to buy some clothes, but did you have to buy so many? Mind your own business. Fang Yuke, let's get something to eat. I don't have any money. Are you OK? Hey! You just hit someone! Hey! Are you OK? Zhou Linlin! Come back. Stop! Get out of the way or I'll kill you! Yes! Are you crazy?! What did you just say? Why don't you mind your own business, bitch?! What are you gonna do about it? What if I hit you? You... What are you doing? You're the one that's in the wrong. OK, calm down. This is a police station. Everyone sit down. The victim agreed to a settlement. Here is the settlement agreement. All the procedures have been completed. I'm going to pay for the medical bills. Can my son go home now? Yes, you can take him. Don't do it again. Wait a second, sir. The man your son hit is still lying in the hospital. You don't think your son owes him an apology? I will not apologize. It's none of your business. Both of you should be ashamed. Didn't you teach your son better than that? What about my dad? Don't talk about my dad! That's enough. It was his bad luck running into me. It's so late. I need to get back. The school gates are already closed. You want to sleep on the streets? Can you fix my computer? The computer in my bag was smashed. This is my brother's place. Come in. We're staying here tonight? Don't worry. I'll sleep on the couch. Why would I be worried? You aren't scared of me? Please. A good student like you would never try anything. Oh yeah. Why do you always carry this pen around? Hasn't anyone told you that you look like an old cadre? They have! I guessed right. There's a reason I carry this in my pocket. What could possibly be the reason? What year is it? Nobody carries around pens anymore. Go to bed. Ruting! You guys are in this class too. That's right. This is a required course for Life Sciences majors. I'm glad you guys are in it too. Ruting! You sit here. You don't want to sit with Fang Yuke? No need! We grew up together. I've seen him enough. I don't know what he's wearing, but... What is written on top? Look! What are you doing?! This is a Life Sciences class. It also covers Animal Husbandry subjects. First, I would like to inform you that, I won't tell you what will be on the test. It will cover everything, depending on how hard you study. So I hope that everyone respects each other and takes this class seriously. Animal Husbandry students, please raise your hands. For the Animal Husbandry students, most of you are taking your majors as springboards. Frankly speaking, I don't care. After all, it's your life. But I hope that before you change departments, you can remember what we'd go through in these required courses. Young lady, your name is Zhou Linlin, right? Yes, professor. I heard you had the lowest entry exam score of all the new Animal Husbandry students. Are you planning on switching departments? No. I'm going to study hard. Good. I hope everyone can get used to getting up early. This can't be happenning. Every students gets a rabbit. Starting at 5 am every day, we have to take their rectal temperature every three hours. And feed them every five hours? And every day we have to record all of their bio-data? My god! It's worse than working on my family's farm. Why do we have to raise rabbits while the Life Sciences just need to write papers? It's not fair. I still need to prepare for my exchange student exam. I don't have time to raise a rabbit. That's right. I have dance practice every day. Oh my goodness! You are so cute! So soft! So cute! Wen Jie, how long does a rabbit live? It depends on its owner. If you take care of it well, it can live for 8 to 12 years. Really? You... Starting today, I will never leave you. Your life is my life. If you help me study well, I will take great care of you. Little Linlin! Zhou Linlin, please will you never leave my rabbit too? Me too. Please! Please! Please! I love you! Please! Please! I'm begging you! Please! OK, fine! Yeah! Thank you! I'll take you out to dinner. Thank you! I'll teach you how to dance. Fang Yuke! Fang Yuke! Fang Yuke! Look! It's so cute. Fang Yuke! Fang Yuke! Fang Yuke! Are you OK? Why am I in the hospital? You fainted. You're scared of fur. I already know. The doctor couldn't find anything wrong with you, so he had me call your family to ask if you had a medical history. So, I gave my mom a call. My mom said, When he was a kid, he had a pet named Fluffy. He really loved Fluffy. Then one day, he came home and couldn't find Fluffy. From then on, he's been permanently scarred. Afraid of fur. In life, there will always be things we're not ready to say goodbye to. Although Fluffy left this world, the memory of him will always remain in your heart. Isn't this a blessing? Thank you. But I have a question. Was Fluffy a boy or a girl? Jier! What kind of party is Ruting's party going to be? It's gonna be like a Hollywood party. Ruting will be dressed like a little princess. She always dresses like a little princess. We can't compare. The point is she wants to find a guy for the opening dance. What kind of guy? The handsomest, best dressed guy, or maybe just the best dancer. Who knows. Fang Yuke! Here you are! I forgot you're afraid of fur. It's OK. I wanted to ask you, can you dance? No! I knew it. Here's the thing, Ruting's birthday party is a dance party. So you need to learn how to dance. Why can't I just sit there and eat? No way! You will be too awkward. What if a girl asks you to dance? Who? Of course... Maybe... Ru... In case it's... Who? Anyway, as long as you can dance a little. Is that what you want? Yes. OK. You said "OK"? Isn't that what you want? Yes. Will you do it if I ask you? Yes. Great! OK, let's dance then. Wait a second. Just do whatever I do. You know? What are laughing at? Stop messing around. Fang Yuke, you... Why is your face so serious? Does someone owe you money? Are you going to kill someone? How should I look? You should smile. Relax your face a little. Be gentle. And then when you're dancing, remember to stick your chest out. You have to stick this out too. It should be a straight line down... You need to move a little. You just need to imagine that standing in front of you is a super cute, super pretty girl. You really like her. You've liked her for a long long time. You've always wanted to dance with her. So the expression in your eyes will tell her... Let's dance some more. Happy birthday! This is for you. Hello, Fang Yuke. Where are you? Did you dress up? Everyone here looks amazing. I'm almost there. OK. Bye bye. Ruting! Linlin! Happy birthday! Oh yeah, this is the most popular snack in my hometown. I haven't had a chance to give it to you. Thank you. Come. I wanted to tell you, today you have to give Fang Yuke a chance. Will you take the opening dance with him? You can see that he's been passionately devoted to you since high school. How are you sure that he's passionately devoted to me? Nonsense! He didn't do all those things for me. Want a drink? Sure! Thanks. Xiao Xi! Cheers! Xiao Xi, you... Are you driving your motorcyle later? I'm going to dance with you later. Look! That guy is so handsome! Who is he? Fang Yuke. Ruting. Happy birthday. Yuke, you look so different today. Thank you. What for? Thank you for coming to my birthday party. I'm so happy. Your present. Thank you. Linlin, look. There's a guy over there who's as handsome as Xiao Xi. Is that Fang Yuke? Today is the goddess of the Life Sciences Department and the "school flower" of China Eastern, Ye Ruting's birthday. Don't you want to find a guy to dance with you? Hurry. Yuke, thank you for changing so much for me. I'm ready to dance with you. It looks like my work is complete. To tell you the truth, this is my first dance party, and the first time I've ever danced. I want to dance with my girlfriend. Happy birthday. Linlin, I'll take you home when you're finished. OK, I'll go with you. She's mine. Don't try to take my childhood sweetheart. Fang Yuke, what are you doing?! Xiao Xi, Listen. How are you even uglier than usual? What? Ruting is prettier than me. Why don't you dance with her? You forgot again. You are my girlfriend. There is nothing between us. We are childhood sweethearts. What do you mean childhood sweethearts? We never even talked before. And we don't understand eachother. We don't even know what we like and don't like. There's not even heat, much less a spark. Hello. Linlin, why didn't you come home last night? Where am I? How would I know where you are? You don't remember what happened last night? My first kiss. My first kiss! This is my brother's place. There's breakfast on the table. Relax. Nothing happened last night. I washed your clothes. My clothes?! Fang Yuke changed my clothes. No. I changed your clothes. Is this breakfast for me? Linlin. Ruting. What are you doing here? I want to apologize to you for getting you involved in me and Yuke's drama. Apologize to me? Did Fang Yuke tell you something last night? He tried to make me mad. He used to really like me, but I just left without saying goodbye. He was really sad. Everything he is doing to you, is just to make me mad. He kissed you last night, but it didn't mean anything. It didn't mean anything? Yes. I gotta go. It didn't mean anything? We're the only two people left in the barn. We will probably be the only two who won't transfer departments. If... I'm just saying "if". If I need a wife for my family farm, would you like... Shut up! Why are you so mad? Was it because of yesterday? You shut up! I was just wondering. He was so handsome yesterday, did you...? You shut up right now! You want to comb my hair? I'm joking! Fang Yuke! I'm breaking up with you. Why? Last night why did you...? Why did you kiss me last night? And you did it while I was drunk. Did you know that was a big deal to me? So, that was your first kiss? It's none of your business. You're still laughing. What's your deal? You were dumped by Ruting, then you used me to make her jealous. I acted as your shield, and your punching bag. What do you really want? It's clear you don't like me, and I don't like you. Why did you kiss me? Your computer is broken right? I bought you a new one. Hey! I'm not done yet, Fang Yuke. Fang Yuke! Fang Yuke! Fine. You brought this upon yourself. Hello. Hello. Fang Yuke, get up and go to the bathroom. Hello, Fang Yuke, I have something important to ask you. What? What came first, the chicken or the egg? Fang Yuke, pick me up some food. I want Potatoes and braised port with no potatoes. Potatoes and braised pork with no potatoes. Green peppers and pork with no green peppers. Fang Yuke, buy me a name brand bag. What? What? Fang Yuke, buy me some feminine hygiene products. You want me to buy you pads? Because I'm your girlfriend. Excuse me. Buying pads? Men are like pads. They can absorb a female's problems in an instant. Are you hot? I can fan you off. Don't be so childish. The line of her leg is so well-proportioned and fit. Like a magazine model. Exactly the same. Really? I'm so awesome! Even though I'm tall. I love lying next to you the most. I love lying on your chest the most. Although I'm a little short. When you hold me I can hear your heart beat. I finally found you. What's up? I want to talk to you about us. Sure. I know I left without saying goodbye before. And it made you mad. But I didn't want to change school. We should always look ahead. I hope that no matter what happened, what's past is past, alright? I really hope that me, you and Linlin can become good friends. OK. Yuke, Linlin, I made some food for you guys. Have some. You're so nice! This is Yuke's. This is yours. Oh. Thanks. Oh. Girls like us need to mind our figures. I made this especially for you. Meat. Eat. Is it good? Yes. I spent a lot of time on it. Hello. Fang Yuke, my rabbit can't sleep. Sing it a song. No way. Hello? Zhou Linlin, can't you let me sleep? Hello everyone. Your parents are busy today, so I'm going to feed all of you. Today I have fresh apple. Let's start with you, Brad Pitt. It's your favorite. Here. One for you. Little Linlin! Little Linlin! Little Linlin! Wake up. Little Linlin! What should I do? Fang Yuke, come quickly! Little Linlin! Fang Yuke! Fang Yuke, I need your help. Go grab the glucose. OK. The little bunny is so well-behaved. Open the door. Open it quickly. I want to come inside. No, I won't open it. Mommy isn't back yet. I won't open it for anyone. Little bunny... Why are you standing there? Why are you singing that? That's what the wolf says to get the rabbits to open the door. You'll scare him singing that. Don't listen to him. Don't listen. Are you stupid? Lab rabbits can only eat feed. They can't eat apples. You almost killed him. I know. Little Linlin. We need to thank Yuke for saving you. He brought you back to life. Starting today, he is your daddy. Hurry, say "daddy". Next time he won't be so lucky. I know. Mommy made a mistake today. Luckily your daddy was here. Hey, why have you been hanging out with Linlin and Yuke so much recently? Do you really want to be with Yuke? Is it important? I just think it's fun. Fun? What do you mean "fun"? So many guys are chasing you, why are you paying so much attention to Yuke? I'm not. At first he was using Linlin to make me jealous. It was so childish. But now it seems Zhou Linlin really likes him. Now it's even more interesting. So, you don't even like Fang Yuke? You just don't want to lose, right? I never lose. How can you act like this? How can you play games with people's hearts? Fang Yuke. You idiot. You can't like Ruting. You just can't. I told you not to like Ruting. You're not allowed to be with her. After observing the rabbits for a few weeks, I believe everyone has a firm grasp of the daily data gained from the test subjects. Today your experiment will be injecting your rabbits with a new lab reagent. After the experiment is over you will all be euthanizing your own rabbits. You are already holding the euthanasia reagent in your hands. Are there any questions? Professor Wang, why do they have to die? There must be some other way. Another way? For example, we can continue raising them, and let this batch of rabbits live. In principle, since you've injected your rabbits earlier, there won't be experimental value any more. So, there's no need feeding animals that have no experimental value at all. Well, maybe we can find people to adopt them. What are you talking about? Who would want to raise contaminated lab animals? Then what if we don't inject them with the reagent? There must be another way to finish the experiment! Forget it. Goodness. As an Animal Husbandry student, if you can't even euthanize a lab rabbit, you... you will never be able to graduate. Forget it. Professor, I'm sorry. I was wrong. If it's because of what happened before, I respectfully apologize to you. I know that you have every right to fail me, and it will serve me right if I can't graduate, but I hope you can reconsider, and let the innocent rabbits live. Only a bad student like you would think I'm doing this to spite you. Today I'll give you a fair chance. Listen everyone. I was originally going to have an Animal Husbandry student and a Life Sciences student work together to propose a thesis and complete this report. If you want this rabbit to live then you will need to convince another student not to inject the reagent, and find a different way to complete the experiment. If Life Sciences students want to support you, I won't stop them. If there are any Life Sciences students who are willing to partner with Zhou Linlin, please raise your hand. Professor, I'll do it. Are you sure, Ye Ruting? Fine. Class dismissed. Ruting, thank you. We're all in this together. Besides, you and her are so close. I support Linlin. You don't have to keep up the charade. Linlin, Ruting is helping you. It's fine. Sorry. Yuke, Linlin must be upset right now. Let me go and talk to her. Zhou Linlin! Why are you doing this? It's only two credits. At the worst I can make it up next year. But I have one condition. You stay away from Fang Yuke. It's a trade. Do you really like Fang Yuke? That's none of your business. You think I'd really let myself lose to someone like you? Zhou Linlin, it's your choice. Do you agree with what I said back in class? Does it matter? It does to me. I really don't care what you think. I'm only doing this for Fang Yuke. Then I would never be your partner. I don't care if I fail or not. Little Linlin, maybe we're not cut out for this place after all. So there's no need feeding animals that have no experimental value at all. Your life is my life. If you help me study well, I will take great care of you. Mommy made a mistake today. Luckily your daddy was here. Every day Zhou Linlin helped us take care of them. Are we really going to kill our rabbits? Oh no! Linlin did something terrible! Only Zhou Linlin would do something like this. But it's really cool. That's just Zhou Linlin being Zhou Linlin. Me? I just thank god I got in at all. Although I don't know why I got into Animal Husbandry, there must be a reason for it. I'm gonna go there, and find the meaning in my life. Next stop, Lishui Town. Please prepare to get off. We're arriving at Lishui Town Station. Are you crazy?! What are you doing? Do you even know what you're doing? Let go of me! What are you doing, Fang Yuke? Are you crazy?! You're the crazy one. Then what are you doing?! I'm getting my shoe. Don't worry about your shoe. I'll buy you a new pair of shoes! Nobody asked you to. Why do you even care about me? At first you said I'm your girlfriend. Then you treat me as a shield. It's obvious you like Ye Ruting. Why are you still interfering in my life? 1 hate you! You hate me? Yes. I hate you. I hate how you think you're always right. I hate how you are so fickle. I hate that you were willing to experiment on the rabbits just like everyone else, knowing full well what would happen to them. Why were you so nice to them at first? It's the same way you treat me. I came here to tell you, I've always been by your side. Do you understand? I don't need your pity. I'm just a bad student. It doesn't matter if I can't graduate. I'm asking you nicely to leave me alone, OK? Take care of the girl you actually want to take care of. Just stay away from me. I want to take care of you! There's no need. I don't need you, Are you an idiot? No wonder you can't see it. I like you. Actually, I've always wanted to ask you. The day before I changed school, what was it that you wanted to say to me? I invited you out that day to tell you I couldn't help you study anymore. Because I like someone else. I have always liked Zhou Linlin. She needs me right now. You like me? Yes. I like you. I've liked you for so long. Here, you can have it. I was seven-years-old at the time. I was so scared and weak. Kids bullied me all the time. You appeared like a Kung-fu master. Saved me. This is for you. I wanted to see you every day. So I decided... Pencil please. Thank you. Yuke, you're buying another pencil? Linlin, where are you going? Linlin. Give Yuke a pencil. Here, try this pen instead. After we got older, there were no contacts between us. You didn't seem to like me. Hey! Can you turn off your light please?! Are you an owl?! Don't you need to sleep?! That was the first thing you ever said to me after we grew up. After that, I purposely stayed up late, just to watch you. Four-eyed, steel toothed, stinky-faced monster. Go back to Mars! You're not welcome on Earth! I didn't know how to go back to Mars, but I knew exactly when you would go out every day, and the route you took to school. Although I didn't know why you suddenly gave me an apple, but I was happy all day. That night, I saw how happy you were. I truly wanted to protect you. I wanted to make sure you would be happy in the rest of your life. Then I had a wild idea. What if we could go to the same college? Or even the same department? I believed that with my help you can make rapid progress in your tests. And have the future that I designed for you.

The night before the entrance exam, I knew that we were both well prepared. 2017 National College Entrance Exam I wasn't nervous at all the day of the test, because my dream was about to come true. Fang Yuke, Do you insist on major in Animal Husbandry Department instead of attending senior class again? Do you know how much everyone expect of you? How much your parents expect of you? Why are you so stubborn? Like a stubborn scar that never heals. When I think of you, it rips my soul apart. Why don't you just switch departments? Do you want to change departments? Everything you said would make me tremble in anxiety. Fang Yuke, is anybody sitting here? Yes. The seat next to me will always be for you. Who? Linlin. But you always foolishly look at someone else, and I would foolishly get jealous. You're blocking the people behind you. But if somebody dared to hurt you, I would stand up to protect you. You're the one that's in the wrong. Are you OK? When I'm in front of you I unconsciously reveal the weakest part of myself. I'm ready to dance with you. I won't let you be alone.

You've always wanted to dance with her. Will tell her... wants to tell her... So I didn't dare to tell you, Zhou Linlin, I really wanted to dance with you. In the end, you walk away, frail and pure.

Quietly watching and protecting you, and I will be there whenever you need me. Fang Yuke, I need your help. Even if that meant I had to face my biggest fears. Mommy made a mistake today. Luckily your daddy was here. I know that you were just thanking me, and you were just joking, but I'd rather believe that we fell in love at that moment. I often ask myself what is it that I like about you? On that day... Hey! You can't run away! Hey! I finally understood. I like your kindness, your courage. You're more authentic than other people. The you that I like never changes. I won't let you be alone. Alone, drifting through the world. I won't let you brave the wind and rain alone. I don't want you to be alone.

This is the very last thing I will ask of you. I want you to have a happy life. Maybe someday you'll find someone else who understands you better. You have to be happier on the next journey. Sometime I wonder if at that moment I already liked you. Braving the wind and rain alone. I won't let you be alone. Enduring the cruelty of this world. Fang Yuke, go back to Mars.

Director, let me ask you what is your definition of a bad student? This bad student helped all of us raising our rabbits. She was so nice to all of us. She didn't care that she might be kicked out to save the rabbits. She was the first one to say "no" while the rest of us remained silent. If she's a bad student, then what about us? We just use the university as an employment agency. We are the real bad students. If you want to expel her, you'll have to expel us too! What are you staring at? Go to class! Including her. You can stay! Thank you! It's time for class. Why does my rabbit have diarrhea every day? You gave Emma Stone too much water. Who is Emma Stone? Linlin gave all of your rabbits names. What about mine? I call him Jonny Depp, because he's really horny. Horny? How do you know? He's always looking for female rabbits to bounce around in front of. And trying to bounce upon them!
