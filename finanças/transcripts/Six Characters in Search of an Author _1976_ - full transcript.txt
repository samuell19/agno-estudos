(light orchestral music) (audience applauding) - [Woman Voiceover] I'm here, I'm home. I am so. (audience applauding) (light orchestral music) (light orchestral music) - [Man] Lights, 13, Phil. - All right $25,000! (woman screaming) - She wishes, she wishes. All right everyone let's move it out, come on, we've got a show to do very soon, very soon. Good morning Leo, nice to see you here. - [Leo] Good morning, good morning. - Oh Wilson. - [Wilson] Yeah? - Let me have that fern. I'll be all right, I'll be all right. Thank you my love, thank you. There we go, everything will be fine soon enough. Excuse me. Morning. - Is the writer here yet? - Ah no, good morning Larry. - Good morning, have you called the writer yet? - No. - Call the writer and... Here are the schedules, all right? - Why thank you Larry. - You got it? You're very welcome Rudy. Okay. All right, all right everyone clear the set except for the actors, Rudy make sure all the actors are here. - [Rudy] Actors on stage! (finger snap) - [Woman] Good morning John. - Good morning my love. - How are you, you look very well today. - Good morning, good morning. - Good morning sir. - A very special good morning to you, each and every one. We have work today, rehearsals, some rewrites if we ever get the rewrites. It is my fond hope we shall go to tape first thing in the morning. - Yes sir. - I realize that may be wishful thinking, nevertheless, we shall all give our best effort shall we not? - [Crowd] Yes sir! - Without further ado, let's begin. - Here's your coffee. - Any sign of that writer? - I'm hoping this afternoon, so we made sure of that. What scene are we doing? - 36, kitchen scene. - Kitchen scene. - Why are we doing the kitchen scene? - I think. - We don't need the kitchen scene. (cast talking over each other) - What's the first scene? - The first scene is the kitchen scene, sir, scene 36. - Alright, everybody here? - Rudy, is everybody here? - No, sir. - Who's missing? - Who's missing? - Leading lady, sir. - Oh, not again. - I'll call her right away. - Rudy, this nonsense has just got to stop. - I know sir, Wilson's gonna call her right away, I was telling- - We're going right ahead without her. - We're going right ahead without her, alright? - That's all there is. - She's right there. - She's right here! - I'm sorry, I simply couldn't get a taxi! What scene are we doing? - Scene 36, the kitchen. - The kitchen?! I'm not even in that scene, now am I? Oh, Momma's so sorry she had to rush poor Mildred out of the house. Larry? - Rudy. - Rudy, take Mildred and tie her near a radiator and be sure that she has plenty of water. - Uh, Wilson? - Good morning, Darling! You do forgive me, don't you? - Yes dearest, I forgive you. Though I have asked you not to bring that dinosaur of yours onto the set. - But you love Mildred! - Nevermind, nevermind. Let's get on with it. - Rudy, get everyone in their places. - [Man] Places everybody for today is forever. - Rehearse camera moves as well sir? - Of course, I do. What do you think I'm here for? - Rudy, get those cameras on the floor and get 'em hot! - Let's have the cameras on the floor, let's get 'em hot! Keep it together, stay loose everyone. - Uh, dearest? Dearest, you are not in this scene, are you? - Then why was I called for 10, darling? - Alright, alright. Uh, Leo? - Yes, Arnold? - We come in on a tight shot of you busily beating an egg. - Excuse me, Arnold, but is it really necessary for me to wear this silly hat? - That's what the script calls for. - But I look ridiculous, don't I? - Yes, you do look ridiculous, that's the point. - But I don't want to look ridiculous. And do I actually have to beat the bloody egg? I mean, can't I use the Mix Master? (crew laughing) - Quiet, quiet! - Quiet on the set. - [Laughing Man] Sorry! - Leo, you will beat that egg and you will wear that chef's hat and if you don't somebody else will. Is that understood? - What's my motivation? - Oh, you wanted motivation? - Uh huh. - Well, I will give you a motivation. This egg you're about to beat stands for reason. It's contents stand for instinct. And you think you're just a man beating an egg, well you're not. You're also the shell of the egg. And as such, you represent reason. Your wife represents instinct, and neither of you is complete. Now do you understand? - No? - Neither do I. What difference does it make, it's a lousy scene and a lousy show, and we're stuck with it. - [Leo] Alright, you can say that again. (man laughing) - Rudy? - Larry, remind me never to hire that actor again. - Oh really sorry, we should probably, we're gonna try to hire him this time though, it's just- - Don't ever, ever again. - Should we roll the tape sir? - Yes, yes. - Yes, okay. - Prepare to roll tape. - What's going on? - What is going on? - What is that? - Rudy, can you fix that? - Camera one, what's going on? - Well, look. - I'm not doing another- - Pete, what's going on? thing until that straightens up. - Is it a light bulb? - I'll just sit here and wait. - What is going on? - It's getting worse, look. - [Man] Hey, c'mon. All right, it's funny, that's real funny. - I don't know what it is. - Which camera are you getting that on? - I don't know, sir. - Wait a minute, I've got- - Sir, camera three is picking - Something here on three. - Up on everything. - I beg your pardon, but would you mind telling me who you are, and what you're doing here? - We're here in search of an author. - Arthur, Arthur who? - No no, Author. - What author? - Any author. - We don't have any authors here. - So much the better. - Then read to me your script. - Camera three, camera three is picking them up. - Walter. - If there's no author here, perhaps you'd be our author. - Are you trying to be funny? - No, please don't say that. We're not trying to be funny. We've come to bring you a script, a story. A drama of terrible suffering and anguish. - If we're a hit, your ratings could go sky high. (crew confusedly muttering) - I'm sorry, you've got to get out of here. No time to waste on lunatics. - Why do you jump to conclusions? You know very well that life is full of infinite absurdities, which don't always have to seem true just because they are true. - What are you talking about? - All I'm saying, is when the ordinary order of things is reversed, people often cry out madness. Well, for example. You work to create real things out of something that only gives the appearance of reality. Now some people might call that madness. But it's the very essence of your profession, isn't it? - You mean that our profession is full of madmen, kooks, is that - No, no, no, no. you're saying? - Making what isn't true seem true for fun. Isn't that your purpose? Bringing imaginary characters to life? - I want you to know sir, that we in our profession are very proud to be involved in a very creative art. A very worthwhile occupation. If our writers in recent years have given us nothing but obscene drivel, and watered down soap opera to perform. I would have you know that we are very proud to have brought to life, in this very studio, great and immortal works. (crew applauding) - Alright, exactly, yes. And given life to beings more alive than those who breathe and wear clothes. Less real, perhaps, but more true. You and I are in complete agreement. - Agreement, I don't know what you're- - I only spoke because you said you had no time to waste with lunatics. - True - It's very simple if you'll just try to understand. You were born a man, right? - Right. - But one can be born in other ways. As a tree, a stone, a stream, (crew laughing) a butterfly, or as characters in a play. - You mean you and your friends here were born as characters? - Now you've got it. Alive as you see us in front of you. (crew laughing) I wish you wouldn't laugh at us. We carry such suffering and horror within us. This woman as you can see, is dressed in mourning. - Now that's it, that's more than enough. Larry, get them out of here. - Yes, please sir, let's go. - You must believe us. - I told you, I'm in rehearsal, write me a letter. - Sir. - I know it's difficult, I know it's difficult. But surely in your profession, you're accustom to seeing the characters created by an author spring to life in yourselves all the time. Is it because there's no script that contains us? Is that why you won't believe? - We're six very interesting characters but lost somehow. - But you see, the author who created us was never able to finish his script. Oh, that's a crime. Because anyone fortunate enough to be born a character in a completed play can laugh at death. Yes, a man must die, and author must die. But a character lives forever. And without having to be anybody special. Who's Sancho Panza, huh? "The Three Musketeers?" Yet they will live forever. Because like seeds that fall in rich soil, they were fortunate. They found the fertile fantasy which raised them. Nourished them and gave them eternal life. - Now what are you trying to say? - We want to live. (crew laughing) - Don't we all. - Oh, you want to live? Through all eternity, huh? - No no, only for a moment, in you. - I think it's extraordinary. (crew muttering to each other) - You've got to give us a chance. Our script is ready, it's here for the making. - We're not here to do improvisations. We're here to do legitimate drama on network television. - Oh, I know, I know! That's why we came to you. - But you've got no script. - The script is inside us. - [Woman] Inside you? (crew laughing) - Well, don't you see? We are the script! - [Crew] Oh no- - We are the drama. And our passion runs so strong, that it's forced us to come to you to let us play them out. - Yes, passion. Oh, if only you knew my passion for him. (laughing manically) - Stop it, stop that laughing! I've had enough of you, stay out of this, I mean it! - Oh, you do? Well, then perhaps you'll allow me ladies and gentlemen, let me show you how I who have been an orphan for only two months, can sing and dance. (vocalizing) ♪ He's yours, he's mine. ♪ (crew laughing) ♪ He's somebody else's too. ♪ (crew laughing) - Quiet, quiet! (crew laughing and clapping) What do you think this is, a honkeyjonk? What's the matter with her, is she out of her mind? - No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. - He's right, it is worse. Won't you let us play it for you? I mean you'll see that (sighs) when this little angel, isn't she beautiful? Oh my darling, my darling. Well, when God suddenly takes this dear child away from her mother. And this imbecile does the stupidest of all stupid things like the idiot he is. And you'll see me run away, yes. I'll run away and you'll be rid of me. Not now, but believe me, soon enough. After all that's happened between him and me, I can't stay here any longer watching the misery of my mother because of this. Look at him. Just look at him. So cold, aloof, superior because he's the legitimate son. He despises me, despises him, he even despises this baby here because we're bastards. Do you understand? We're bastards. He won't even recognize his own mother. This woman here who is the mother of us all. He treats her with contempt. As if she were only the mother of use three. You swine. Please, for the sake of the children, I beg of you. - A chair, a chair for the widow! - Rudy! - C'mon, a chair, good. - I want you to see her face. - No, no, please for God's sake, don't please. - C'mon, show them your face. - [Crew] Oh. - Please, don't let him go on with this. It's too awful. - Only I don't understand, you say this lady is your wife? - Yes, she's my wife. - You're alive, how can she be a widow? (crew laughing) - Don't laugh. For Christ's sake, don't laugh. This is our story. She's had a lover. A man who rightfully should be here. - No, no. - He has the good fortune to be dead. He died only two months ago, that's why we're still dressed in mourning. - But the reason he isn't here is not because he's dead. See her story is not in the love of two men, for whom she was incapable of feeling anything. Except a little gratitude for him, not for me. No, her story, her tragedy, is in the children. Her four children she had by those two men. - Did you say I had those two men? Have you got the merit to suggest that I wanted them? It was his doing. He forced me to go away with the other man. - That isn't true. - It isn't? - No, it isn't. - What do you know about it? - I know. Listen, don't believe her. Can't you see why she's doing it? Because of him! See, she wants to make him believe that if she left him when he was only two years old it was because he made her do it. - But he did make me. As God as my witness, he did. You just ask him, you ask him if he didn't. And you don't know anything about it. - I know you were happy with my father. That you lived together in peace and contentment. I know you used to laugh. Can you deny it? - No, I don't deny it. - He loved you. He loved you everyday of his life. Isn't that true? Go on and tell them. Why don't you say something, you little fool? - Would you just leave that poor child alone? Now why do you want to make me seem ungrateful here? I don't wanna say anything against your father, I just, I... Don't you understand that it wasn't my fault? I didn't, I didn't want to leave my baby, I didn't want to leave, my home. - You know something, this is quite a show. - I like him. - Just be quiet. - What she says is true. It was my doing. - Yes, now you're going to hear a fine piece of philosophy. Words, words, nothing but words. - Yes, words. Words that bring consolation to all of us. When we're faced with something so horrible and have to live with such guilt, words that may say nothing but bring peace. - Don't any of you see that there is no script? There is no story, there is no play, there is no author, there is nothing. Send us away. - Oh, there's a script alright. And a little bit of money too. The money he offered as payment, ladies and gentlemen. For special, favors? (giggles) - My God, you are revolting. - Revolting? But there it was, in a pale blue envelope. On a round mahogany table in a room provided by Madame Pache. Do you all understand about Madame Pache? - [Crew] No. - Oh, well. She was one of those ladies that ran a very special, elegant dress shop. Where decent girls from poor families were trained step by step in the delicate art of pleasing lonely, old men. - Haven't you got any shame? - Shame? This is my revenge. I am trembling with desire to play that scene. I can see the room. Here is the window, there's the fireplace. And the pit. And over here in front of the window, is the round mahogany table and the pale blue envelope. I have only to reach out and pick the money up. But you men should turn your backs, 'cause I'm naked! (laughs) (crew laughing) I used to blush. I don't anymore. But he does. - You, you've got to let me explain. You've got to let me tell how it really was. - You only wanna tell it your way! - You see, you see? This is the cause for the whole trouble, right here. The very words we use. Each of us has inside himself his own special world. And how can we ever understand each other. If I put into the words I use, the sense and value of things as I see them, and whoever is listening inevitably translates them into the sense and value they have for him. You see we, think we understand each other, we never really do. - You know how to talk. - You see? You see, all my pity. All the pity I feel for this poor woman, she takes as some special form of awful cruelty. - But you sent me away! - I sent her away, she believes that. - Look, sir, believe me. See, you see after her married me, I don't even know why he did. I was a poor, shy sort of girl. - That's why I loved you. That's why I loved you! I loved you for, and marriage! For those very qualities, the shyness, the humility. She won't listen. She won't listen, she won't listen. She's deaf, she's mentally deaf. She has a good heart for the children, but her brain is deaf. - This is all very interesting darling, it really is interesting. But are we going to work today? - Just hear them out. - We're behind schedule. (crew speaking all at once) - Please make this very clear for us. - Alright. I had a man working for me. An assistant, an effectual kind of a fella. But as time went on, he became attached to her. Now there was nothing wrong with that, he was a good man. Very modest, self-effacing. Pretty much like her. The two of them were incapable of doing anything wrong, or even thinking about it. - So you thought it for them and just urged 'em on! - Don't interrupt! I thought what I was doing would be good for them. And myself as well, I guess. You see, things had come to the point that I couldn't say a word to either one of them Without seeing them look at each other, asking each other with their eyes how to handle me. To keep me from getting angry. Well, that was enough as I'm sure you can understand, to keep me at a constant rage. - Why didn't you fire this assistant? - I did, I did! But then I had to watch this poor woman wandering around the house like some forlorn lost animal. You know, the strays you take in out of pity? - But- - I know, I know, the son. You want me to tell him about the son. - He took my baby away from me. - Not out of cruelty! I sent him away to the country so he could grow up strong and healthy. Because she didn't seem strong enough. I couldn't live with her any longer. Not so much because of the irritation she caused me, or the boredom, the awful boredom. But because of guilt. The pity I felt for her, she was so unhappy. - So he sent me away. - But well provided for! And to the other man so that she might be happy and free of me. - And to free himself. - That could've been part of it. And a great deal of harm came from it. But I did it more for her sake than my own, I swear! Didn't I keep track of you? Didn't I keep track of you until your friend suddenly carried you off to another town, with no forwarding address, nothing? Did I even bother you? Wasn't I content to watch from a distance? Oh, I wanted to watch. But with no ulterior motive, I only wanted to watch this incredibly tender family growing up around her. She can testify to that. - I most certainly can. When I was just a little girl, with braids down to my shoulders, and panties you could see up underneath my short skirt, I used to see him standing by the door of the school waiting for me. He came to watch me to see how I was growing up. - Ridiculous! - Oh, why? - It's ridiculous, it's monstrous! After she went away, my house became empty. See, she had been a disappointment to me but she had filled my house. But then the thought of her and them began to fill my emptiness. I wanted to be sure that she was happy, at peace. Free of all the complicated torments of my spirit. And so to have a kind of proof of this, I would go and watch the little girl coming out of school. - Indeed, he would. He used to follow me along the streets after school, 'till I got home. He would smile at me and wave. I looked at him, not without interest, wondering who he was. I told my momma about it and she guessed immediately that it was him. Momma didn't want me to see him so she kept me home from school for a few days. But when I did go back, there he was. Paper bag in his hand. (laughs) He came over to me and put his arm around me, and caressed me. And then he opened up the paper bag, and took out of a big, beautiful straw hat. A present for me. - Yeah, but haven't we strayed a little bit from our story here? - Well, yes. But this is literature. - Literature, hell. This is passion, this is life! - Maybe but it won't play. - Oh, I know. This is just the background. I'm not suggesting we stage this part. As you can see, she's no longer the little girl with braids down to her shoulders. - And pretty little flowered panties you can see up underneath my short skirt! - Now the action. Now the plot, now complex. - After my father died. - After her father died, they came back here in awful poverty. And due to her stupidity, I knew nothing about it. If she couldn't bring herself to get in touch with me, she should've had her son or daughter let me know they were in need. - How could I know you felt that way? - That was always your mistake. You never understood any of my feelings. - After all these years and everything that had happened- - Is it my fault you disappeared? Is that my fault? I tell you, one day they were here and the next day, they were gone! Well, years went by. Naturally, my interest in them dwindled. But then, then when they came back, when they came back the whole thing exploded. And I mean, violently. Because I was driven by the demands of my flesh. My miserable flesh. Which is still alive with desire. Can you understand the misery and the guilt of a moral man living alone trying divert himself with music and literature, unable to think of nothing but women? You know what it means to hate casual affairs and still be driven to them? Not old enough to do without a woman, or young enough to look for one without shame and loathing? Did I say it's miserable? It's horrible! Knowing all the time that no woman, no woman's gonna give herself to me for love. Well knowing that, I should do without, shouldn't I? Well, of course I should. Or at least as far as the world's concerned, seem to do without. 'Cause we all wanna appear to our fellow man at our best, dressed in a costume of dignity and propriety. But we all know the unconfessable things that lie in the secrets of our own hearts. And it takes courage to admit one's guilt, takes courage. The minute a man reveals his inner feelings, society right away, calls him a cynic. Says he's different. Well that's not so, that's not so. He's not a cynic, he is different, he's better. He's much better because he's not afraid to reveal his shame. The shame to which most men close their eyes. And a woman, now, is a woman different? She looks at you, inviting, tantalizing, and you go to her, you go to her and you take her in your arms. No sooner does she feel herself in your grasp, she closes her eyes. That's the sign of remission. That's the sign by which she says to men "Blind yourself, I'm blind." - What disgust I feel for all of this philosophy of his! It's nothing more than an elaborate excuse for his own lechery. I can't listen to anymore. When he reduces life to one simple ingredient, lust. - You know, what he says is true. I know in my own case... Alright, enough philosophizing, just get on with the story. - Alright, alright. How was I to know that after the death of her lover, they'd come back here in such utter poverty and because of her ignorance, she'd go to work at a place like Madame Pache's. - Well, how was I supposed to know? I needed money and it never entered my head that that woman had her eye on my daughter. - Poor momma, you know what that woman did? She told me momma's work in the shop was so inefficient, so unsatisfactory that she was gonna put us both out. Unless I took on some special work. So I did. And I supported all of us. And then one day, I received a visit from an unexpected client. - Him? - (laughs) Yes, him. Now, there's a scene for you to play. - With the interruption just- - Almost in time! - Before, in time, in time! Because fortunately, I recognized her in time. For me, for me the whole drama lies in this one thing. Each of us believes themselves to be a single person. One identity, constant, integrated. Well that's not true! With you I might be one person, with you I might be another person altogether. But we persist in the illusion that we're the same person with everyone we know. And we realize that isn't true when for just one moment, the giant arm of fate hoists us up and holds us for all the world to see. When our behavior in one passing moment is held suspended, as if our life were made up of only that one moment. A man's worth, a man's life cannot be judged by one solitary act! Now do you see the treachery of this girl? She would sentence me forever because at one moment, accidentally, with no intention, I suggested love to her in a room where she should never have been in the first place. She's trying to condemn the entire reality of my life because of one shameful, fleeting moment of mistake. That's unjust. The whole disaster of our drama hinges on that injustice. And not only to me, but to the others. To my son here. - You just leave me alone, I have nothing to do with all this. - What're you talking about? - I have nothing, and I want nothing to do with it because as you very well know, I wasn't meant to be mixed up in this with you. - We're not good enough for him. He's so superior. But as you may have noticed ladies and gentlemen, when I look at him now, he can't look me in the eye. Because he knows the harm he's done me. - Harm, me? - Yes. I owe my life in the streets to you because you rejected us. We were intruders who had come to invade the kingdom of your legitimacy. - Oh, it's all very great sport for you, isn't it? Ganging up on me this way, always putting me in the wrong. But just imagine, just imagine how I felt that particular day when a cocky young Black girl arrived at the front door demanding to see my father, with only a secretive smile on her face just hinting as to the nature of her business with him. Oh, she left. But she came back again. This time she brought the little girl with her. I let them in. I saw her speaking to my father in such a mysterious tone of voice asking him for money that I knew he had to give it to her. Had some obligation to do so. - It's an obligation I have to your mother. - How was I to know that? When did I ever see her? Or hear of her until one day she arrived with her, and this time a little boy, and a little girl, and this time they brought their luggage. And then I was suddenly told "This is your mother, too." you know? And as time went on, I began to understand from her attitude, how and why they had come to live with us. I, I can't even begin to express what I feel about it, I don't allow myself to think about it. So you see, no action can be expected from me in this story. I'm an unrealized character dramatically, and I find my self very much ill at ease in their company so please, just leave me out of this. - It's ridiculous, it's because you're like them- - What do you know about that? What do you know about me? Or what I'm like? When did you even concern yourself about me? - Alright, I admit that. But isn't that a dramatic situation in itself? This aloofness of yours, it's so cruel to me and your mother. Think of her coming home and seeing you for the first time, a grown man, not knowing you and knowing her son. Look at her, she's crying. - Like the fool she is. - She can't stand you. He says he has nothing to do with this? You'll see he has everything to do with it! Look at the little boy, always frightened. Crying, clinging to his mother. It's his fault he's like that. I guess his position's the most painful of all. He's very much like his father, humble, quiet. - We'll cut him out, you've no idea the nuisance children can be around a studio. - Oh, he won't be a problem. He disappears very soon, the little girl too. She's the first to go. - Good, good. - This is interesting, very interesting. There might be a basis of a script here. - And you have a character like me. - Shut up. - It's quite original, too. - Nothing like it's ever been done. - You have a nerve coming here and throwing this idea at me. - Well, born as we were for a theatrical presentation. - Hey, you're an actor. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just say that we were born for theatrical presentation. - You're not trying to pull anything over on us. - Oh no, no, no, no. I only act the part for which I was cast, the part I was given in life. But because I've read a great deal and I get emotional, I get a little theatrical without meaning to. (laughs) (crew laughs) - I understand, but still without an author... - You be the author. - What're you talking about? - You be the author, why not? - Me, because I've never written a word in my life, that's why not. (crew murmuring) - But you could do it, it can't be difficult. Everybody does it, and you have all of us alive in front of you. - It could be interesting. Supposed I'd have to call the front office and check with them, but might be worth trying. - Worth trying, worth doing, think of the scenes that will come out of it. - You tempt me, you tempt me. Alright, we'll take a crack at it. You come with me, we'll have to call it rehearsal. - Right. - Change the schedule, get some kind of continuity out of the script. - Give them a break? - Yeah, give them a break. - Rudy, give them a short break, short. - [Rudy] Take five, everybody, but only five. - What a joke, what a monstrous joke. - Why won't you look at me? Why do you treat me this way? Haven't I been punished enough? And now I, I've got to be put on exhibit as well. - And what about me? Must my shame be exposed as well? Must everyone know about my mother running off with another man? A Black man? My father, a lecher. Can't I at least be allowed to conceal some of this whole shameful business? - Alright, we're back everyone. - Let's get everybody, let's get everybody back. - Everybody go back, go back. (all chattering) - Go, go. - Costumes, where's Catherine? - Okay, yes, everyone's here. - Call site. - Get the cameras on the floor, get them hot. - Let's have the cameras on the floor, let's get them hot, please. - Quiet please! - Quiet please! - Attention please, now clear the stage. We're going to have to set the scenery for scene one. We need a door and a bed, that's the main. (crew talking) It doesn't matter! - That's all we have. - Hey Barry, you've got a red one back there. - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter- - Bring down the chandelier. - If you have to run through, please don't interfere. - I need a round, mahogany table. (crew shouting) - [Man] Let's fire up those bangers. - Now we need some dressing, something that says ladies dress shop. Yeah, that's fine, that's fine. Rudy, you're going to sit right here next to me. - Wasn't red, it was yellow. - Here's continuity, action. - What I want you to do is sit here and write down the dialogue and the business. - In short hand, sir? - You know short hand? - No sir, I know speed writing - Alright, that'll do, okay. Now actors, please. Clear the set and stand where you can see what's going on and pay attention. - Excuse me darling, but do I have to do this? - Dearest, dearest, don't worry. You will not have to do any improvising. - Well, what will we be doing? - You just watch and listen. You'll get scripts later. Right now we're going to do a run through, and they're going to do it. - Excuse me, excuse me. What do you mean by run through? - Your rehearsal, for them. - But we're the six characters. - And as characters, you do not perform. Actors perform. As characters, you will remain in that script there, if and when we get a script. - There is no script. And you're lucky enough to have the six characters themselves alive in front of you. - You really want to be the whole show, don't you? You want to conceive it, supervise the writing, direct it, then act in it before the public yourselves. - Well, of course. That's why we're here. - Hell of a show that would be. (crew laughing) See the whole thing is laughable. - What do you think we're here for? - That's right, we better do a little casting. Shouldn't be difficult, it's a matter of type. The mother, you play the mother. - Alright. - We'll have to give her a name. - Amelia. - Amelia? - But that's your wife's real name, you don't want to use that, do you? - Why not, it's her name. - You want Amelia? Amelia, it is. Now, then, son, you play the son. - Oh, thank you, sir. - And the step-daughter... you play the step-daughter. - What, that woman, me? Oh (laughs) - Will you stop - laughing please? - Nobody laughs at me like that. If I'm not going to be treated with respect, I'll leave. - She should be flattered to be played by you. - That's right. - I wasn't laughing at you, it's just that you're so unlike me. - Right, you see that's what we're trying to express to you. - Stop it, stop it, forget whatever it is you're trying to express. What you feel inside yourself is utterly unimportant and irrelevant. - But it's our feelings, it's our emotion. - But you're just the raw material for my actors. And if this little drama of yours holds our attention at all, it'll be thanks to the talent of my actors. (crew murmuring) - I hate to contradict you, but we're the ones who are suffering. We're the ones you're talking about with these bodies, these faces. - Costume and makeup takes care of that. - But it's our feelings. - Once and for all, what you are, yourselves do not belong in this piece. This gentlemen will play you and that's all there is to it. - I understand, and now I also think I understand why our author didn't want to finish his play. I don't want to offend your actors, God knows. But when I think I'll see myself represented by- - By me, if you have no objection. - I'm flattered, I'm flattered. But I still think that this gentlemen, no matter how hard he tries with all his good intentions, all his professional abilities, he can't- - Go on. - But it'll be impossible for him to portray me as I really am. It'll be apart from the makeup. His interpretation of how he thinks I feel and not how I really feel at all. And whoever criticizes us should take that into account. - He's worrying about the critics already. (crew laughing) Okay, c'mon we haven't got any time for that. Everybody, would you clear the stage please? - Clear the set, please. - Alright, now let's see what we've got. What do you think? How does the set look to you? - Well, to tell you the truth, I don't recognize it at all. - You don't expect us to build Madame Pache's establishment out of old bits of scenery, do you? Seems the sets about right, move that little table a few feet over. Alright, now then, scene one. Alright, the step-daughter. No dear, her, not you. - Her now? - You just stand there and watch. - Watch me live it. - Oh well, just wait until it's my turn to play it. I'll make it live, don't you worry about that. - Alright, ladies, ladies, will you please stop arguing? C'mon, stand over here. Now, daughter and Madame Pache, now. Hey, where the hell is Madame Pache? - She isn't with us. - Well, what do we do now? - Well, she's alive. - If you say so, where? - Let me show you. Ladies, I wonder if I could borrow some hats. I need three hats, three hats. And coats, coats or sweaters, anything. Thank you, that's great. Oh, another hat, thank you, thank you. Bring that, bring that. We'll put the hats like that. Like that, yes, put it around her shoulders here. Thank you, my dear. There, this is fine. Here we are, thank you. Ah, yes, yes, good. Now, now we're ready for our scene. - I'm sorry, but would you mind telling me exactly what you think you're doing? - Not at all, just decorating the set. I thought she might be attracted by the articles of her trade, and appear among us, look. - Hey, what kind of a trick is that? - Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it all! Why do you call it a trick? This is truth. Why do you have to try to destroy it? Which actress among you will play Madame Pache? - I do. - Well, this is Madame Pache in person. At least admit that what you will do will be less real than what you see before your very eyes. Madame Pache herself. Now stays where you are, quietly. And watch the scene. (crew exclaiming) - A little louder please. Louder! - We can't hear! - Well, how loud? She can't yell about these things at the top of her lungs. It could mean prison for her. - You're playing a scene for an audience, right? So you're with her, alone in Madame Pache's bedroom, where no one can hear you and then you speak up so we can hear you. - No. - What do you mean no? - There's someone who might hear us if we don't keep our voices down. - Oh, have you got somebody stashed away again? - She's referring to me. I have to be behind the door their way, Madame Pache knows that. - Yeah, but first you have to finish the scene between you and Madame Pache. - Oh, for God's sake. She's only telling me what you already know. That my mother's work in the shop is unsatisfactory and that I must cooperate if she's going to continue to help us. - My good sir, (speaking foreign language). (crew laughing) You do not think I take advantage of her! - What is she talking about? - Well it's the way she speaks, I think it's half Spanish. I know it sounds ridiculous. - How unkind of you people to make fun of the way I speak. (crew laughing) I speak the best I can. (speaking foreign language) - Madame, please don't be offended. Just speak just the way you do, pay no attention to them. This is terrific, a comedy act to cover up the crudity of the basic situation. - Of course it will. We'll let her make everything sound like a joke. I mean, how ridiculous to hear. That an old senor wishes to amuse himself with me. Isn't that right, Madame Pache? (speaking foreign language) - If you do not like him, if he is not to your taste, he will not give you any trouble. (woman yelling) (crew shouting) - Hold her down! - Get ahold of yourself! - They can't be here together. - That's why Madame Pache wasn't with us when we arrived. The two of them in here together gives away the who thing in advance. - Please madam, please come. Sit down, that's better. - Madame, shall we go on. - Ah, no thank you. I will do nothing more, (speaking foreign language). - But you must introduce me to the old senor who wishes to amuse himself with me. Now we have to do the scene, that's all there is to it. - No! - Well then, go. - I go, I go, I most certainly go. (speaking foreign language) (crew laughing and applauding) - [Man] Bravo! - You must make your entrance. Well, there's no need to actually do it, pretend you've already entered. I'm standing over here, my eyes lowered. The picture of modesty. And then you come over to me- - Ah, ah, look my dear, just a minute. Are you directing this or am I? Okay, now. You stand there, you don't have to come in. You just stand there as though you'd come in, you enter, and then you play the scene. Alright, we're going to record. - We're gonna roll three, let's have quiet on the set. - [Man] Quite please! (crew muttering) Quiet. (indistinct) - All right, now then. Cameras ready? - Cameras ready? - Camera three. All right, action. - Good evening, miss. - Good evening. - Oh, well. This isn't your first time, is it? - No, no sir. - Been here before? More than one? You don't have to be so shy. The hat- - No, sir. I'll take it off myself. - Nice, very nice. Not much of a hat. Pick one up, I'll get it for you. - Oh, no. Thank you, sir. - Why not? Pick one out, you don't want to make me angry, do you? - Oh, no sir, but you see I just couldn't wear it. - Why not? Oh. Ready to find that home. I'm sure you'll think of something. - No sir, it isn't that. It's because, oh, I'm surprised you hadn't noticed. - Are you in mourning? Oh, I see, I'm sorry. - Sir, please. Don't be sorry or feel embarrassed for me. Please try to put it out of your mind. Because you see, I'm trying to forget that I'm dressed this way. - Hey, that's good. Cut! That was excellent! (crew applauding) Excellent, even better than I dared to hope. All right, now Rudy, don't write down the last- - Why can't we go on, the best part is still to come. - Please be patient, we'll get to it later. Now you two. I'd like to be clear, play it, you play it naturally, with a touch of lightness, yeah? - But, I think there's a certain dangerous quality in the man, don't you think so? - Oh, it isn't a difficult scene, is it? - Well, you know- - Shall we try it, Leo? - I'll go get ready for my entrance. - Uh, dearest, dearest. Wig, all right. - I've got to put on my hat. - Right, right, right. So, stand there, with your head lowered- - (laughing) She's not even dressed in black! - Well, I will be dressed in black. But I'll be chic. - Will you please go and sit down and shut up. Maybe you'll learn something about show business. All right, now we are ready. Ready to play back, you get out get out of there. - Let's have quiet on the set please. - Stand by. - All right. - All right? - And action! - Good evening, miss. (laughing) - Oh, no, no. - Will you shut up? What are these interruptions? - I'm sorry, it's the way he said "Good evening". - See, See, his voice and tone- - Exactly right for him. - I'll say here sir, if I'm going to play an old boy who's coming into a cathouse, I can't do it like a choir boy. - Don't pay any attention. - I know but- - That's very good, that's very good. - Let's do it again. - Don't mind him. - All right. - From the top. - Quiet on the set. - Stand by. - Everyone ready, and action! - Good evening, miss. - Good evening. - This isn't the first time, I hope. - Not I hope, is it? - That's right, "Is it" with a question. - I remember, it's "I hope". - Is it is it? - Is it? - It is, isn't it? - Is it "I hope", what difference does it make? Lighter, lighter, let me. - All right. - Good evening, miss. - Good evening. - See, surprise, pleasure, and a touch of fear, you understand? - All right, all right. - This is not the first time, is it? Then you say "No sir" but lighter please, more flexible. - All right, all right. I'll try it. - [Man] All right, and, action! - No sir. - You've been here before then, more than once. - C'mon, you've got to leave a pause so she can nod. You've been here before then, more than once? - [Step-Daughter] Oh god. - What is it now? - [Step-Daughter] Nothing, nothing. - All right, all right. (clears throat) - Wait a minute. - Quiet, and, action! - You've been here before, then. More than once? (chuckles) Well, there's no reason to be so shy then, is there? May I take off this little hat? (laughing) - Look, I'm not going to stand here and have that woman make a fool out of me. - Pay her no mind, let's forget the whole thing. - Are you out of your mind? - Please forgive me. - Have you no manners at all? You should be ashamed of yourself. - Of course you're right, but please do excuse her. - Excuse her, another scene, that's rudeness! - Well, you see when they play it, they make it seem so strange. - Strange, what's strange about it? - Well, please forgive me but I admire you actors. This lady, this gentleman, I admire them but the play's becoming theirs, it isn't ours any longer. - But that's inevitable, I told you that would happen. - I know you told me that would happen. - Oh, I would never (grumbles angrily) - This is terrible! (crew speaking all at once) - And please be quiet! Alright, now I'm, look. You say "You mustn't worry about me, mustn't be embarrassed about me, and put me out of your mind." And then you answer quickly "I understand, I understand." then you- - What's this? - [Director] Then you ask her why she's in mourning. - But that's not right. When I told him that I was trying to forget that I was dressed in mourning, you know what his answer to me was? "Oh, well, then supposed we take off this little dress?" - That's right, and then we get thrown right off the air. - Well, it's the truth. - Truth, the truth, we are doing television drama. Other places, the truth. Here, only up to a point. - And what are you gonna do instead. - Just shut up and watch me and let me work. - No, no I won't. You wanna take all my agony, all the cruel reasons why I am what I am, and twist it into a sentimental, romantic little tear-jerker. When he asked me why I'm dressed in mourning, I suppose I'm to answer him weeping bitterly "Oh, my poor dead daddy died two months before." No, No, I won't have it. And his answer to me must be immediately, "Then suppose we take off this little dress." And I with my heart, still grieving for my father, dead only two months. Unbutton my dress, and I took it off. - For God's sake. There are some things you cannot do on the air. - Oh, you can't Then I don't need to stay here any longer. And thank you very much for your time. There's no need for me to stay here any longer. - Now just a minute- - No! I won't say here, I won't. You worked it out with him already there in the booth. I understand too well. He wants to jump ahead to the place where he can act out the scenes of his spiritual torment. His celebrated remorse. But I wanna play this scene. My scene, mine. - Your scene, your scene, your part. Well allow me to tell you there are other people in this show besides yourself. There's him, and there's her. Can't have one character hogging the whole thing. Throwing everyone else in the shade. Characters must be integrated in one, harmonious ensemble. Now look, why don't you restrain yourself a little? Creates a very bad of impression, the shouting. The fury, after all, you do admit that there were others at Madame Pache's before him. - Yes, that's true, but all the others were him to me. - The others were him, I don't understand? - When someone goes wrong, the one who is responsible for the first step is responsible for all the others. And he was responsible to me even before I was born. - What if he was? Doesn't the responsibility and the guilt for that responsibility mean anything to you? You must let him have his feelings. - His own story in his own way, is that what you mean? You want to spare him that moment of being caught in my arms after he asked me to take off my dress of mourning. The child he followed home from school. The child already a whore. Today you see us as we are here. Still unknown to the public. Tomorrow you can play us in your own way. Anyway you wish. You don't want to know our story as it actually happened. - Of course I do, I've asked for nothing better, of course I want to play that scene. - Then ask my mother to leave us. - No, no, please, please. Don't go on, I beg of you, please. - Ma'am, please, I must see it happen. - I can't stand it, you're torturing me. - But it's already happened, I don't understand. - Can't you see it's happening now? It happens always. I'm always alive and I feel this pain in every minute. Repeats itself over and over. I can't even die. I must live it and feel it forever. My babies, my little ones. Did you ever hear them speak? They can't speak any longer. But they still cling onto me in order to keep my torment fresh and alive. And this one? This one has run away. She's run away from me. She's lost, lost. And if I see her, I know it's for just one reason. To renew my suffering. The suffering I must feel because of her. - This is what we've been talking about. This is our eternal moment. She's here to trap me. Keep me suspended forever because of that one shameful, fleeting moment in my life. She cannot give up that scene, and you can't spare me of it. - Who said I didn't want to play it? Of course I want to play it! Forms the climax of the first scene, right up to the mother's entrance. Just before the commercial. - All right. If you let me play the scene all the way through, I'll do it completely dressed, provided my arms, only my arms are naked. - All right, all right. - After, I'd taken off all my clothes, he came to me and embraced me. And I put my arm around his neck. When I saw a vein pulsing in my naked flesh, he somehow, the pulsing of that vein in my naked flesh filled me with such disgust that I closed my eyes. I let my head sink onto his shoulder. Now momma, now, cry out, momma! - No! My daughter, my daughter, you monster, you monster. Don't you realize she's my daughter! - That's wonderful, my god, that's wonderful! And then fade out! That cry, and then fade to black. Fade to black! - Fade to black! - [Director] You idiot, I didn't mean fade to black. Give me some lights. (crew exclaiming) Not those lights. Real lights. Regular lights. - Quiet, quiet. - Quiet, everyone. - Shut up! - Quiet, please. - Now, if you don't mind we'll get on to the next scene. What is it? Garden, the next scene is the garden. - Clear the set! - Clear the set. - Uh, we must begin with our entrance into the house. - Yeah, look, this time will you please not interfere? - I won't say another word except well, the entire act can't take place in the garden. - Why not? - Because he spends most of his time in his room, shut up alone, away from the rest of us. He never went into the garden except for that one day. - Don't you understand we can't have four or five setups in each scene. It breaks the illusion. - Dammit, don't use that word. Don't say illusion. - Why not? - (sighing) Surely, surely, you understand by now. - Talking of the illusion created for the audience. The illusion of reality. - Yes, the illusion created by our performances. - I understand you, I understand you. You still don't understand us. For you and your actors, this is all and rightly so, rightly so, a kind of a game. A make believe. - A game? We're not children, we're professional actors and to us, this is a very serious business. - And has been for years. - I'm sure it is, I'm sure it has been for years, I'm sure of that. What I mean, what I mean when I use the word game, is that you are dedicated, as you yourself just said. to the creation of the illusion of reality. - Exactly. - We have no other reality outside this single illusion. Think about that for a minute. Let me ask you something, who are you? - Me? - Yeah. - I'm myself. - I say you're not, I say you're me. - And I say you're crazy! (crew laughing) - Oh, well then I ask him. Who are you? - I say I'm me, too. - Oh, you're not me? - Hell no, thank the lord. - Why not? - Because you're disagreeable. You're philosophical and I like life to be plain, and simple and quiet. I mean, how could I be you. - That's right, you can't be me. Yet you would dare to go on television and pretend before millions of people that you are me. So you see? For you and your actors, this is nothing but a game. Now let me ask you again and very, very seriously. Who are you? - Now you have one hell of a nerve. You come in here, you sell me the idea that you're a character, and you turn around and ask me who I am. A character may always ask a man who he is. Because a character has his own complete identity. His history, his memory, his will, his personality, his life, all complete. Limited to his own precise existence. Think back in your life to say, oh some 10 years ago. Can you tell me exactly the circumstances in which you were living, exactly how you felt about people, exactly how they felt about you? - Yeah, up to a point I can. - Up to a point. Remember, that was once your complete reality. - Now what are you talking about? - All I'm trying to show you is that while we have no reality outside this single illusion, you have no reality at all. What you feel at this very moment, all your thoughts and actions of today are destined to become a half-remembered dream to you tomorrow. You see, time makes your reality an illusion. - You mean that you and this little drama you want to play are more real than we are. - Without any doubt. (crew laughing) - You don't say? - I thought you realized that from the beginning. See, your reality can change from day to day. - Of course it can, everybody changes. - Not ours! Don't you see? That's the point, that's the big difference. Our reality does not change. It cannot change. It cannot ever be other than it is because it is fixed forever. - God's sake, c'mon. Let's get going, let's get to the action. - It seems to me we have too much action for you already, without even staging our entrance into the house. You said yourself you couldn't change scenes every five minutes. - I have explained to you that we take the action and we consolidate it into one big, dramatic scene. For instance, that little brother of yours. He comes running home from school doesn't he? Then he goes mooning around the house, wandering from room to room, and hiding behind doors and in corners. And all the time there's this thing forming in his mind, what did you say it did to him? - It consumes him, wastes him away. - I don't remember your saying, oh yeah. It's growing all the time in his eyes. That's right, meantime. The little girl is in the garden blissfully playing. Totally unaware of what's happening. Now, you've got the boy in the house, girl in the garden. You think that's practical? - But you have to show her playing in the sun. Playing joyfully, that's my only reward. Her giddy, her giddy and that garden, after all the misery and squalor that loathsome room where the four of us were sleeping together. I with her, I remember it with the whole of my contaminated body lying next to hers as she slept, holding me tightly in her tender, loving, innocent arms. In the garden when she saw me, she would run to me, and take me by the hand, and show me the flowers she discovered. She didn't care for the big ones, instead she'd walk me around to show me the little one's she'd discovered. "Wee tiny ones" she called them. Wanted to show them all to me. So happily, so happily. (sobbing) - Don't cry, don't cry. We'll show the garden, we'll show the garden. We'll show the garden! We'll put the whole last scene in the garden, how's that? All right, now I want the fountain. (crew shouting) All right, now I also want sights. Bring in the sights. - Bring in the sights. - And that pastoral drop of ours, bring that in. - Country drop! - Yes, of course I do. - Cameras on the floor! - Get 'em hot! - Trees, c'mon. - The trees! The evergreens- - And the old bushes, too. - Bring in the bushes, Darryl, bring in the bushes too. - All right, now lights, I'm going to want some lights. - Lights! - All right, c'mon. Let's get some blue of course, midnight blue. Now, come on, more blue. There's nothing on the drop there, more blue. That's better, that's it. All right, okay, all right, all right. Clear the set. Instead of hiding the little boy up in his room, we'll put him here in the garden, behind one of the trees. You know we're going to have a hard time finding a child to play that scene when she tells you about the little flowers, it's gonna be tough. All right now, c'mon, c'mon. Oh, be a good boy. What is the matter with him, doesn't he ever say anything? C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, just c'mon, c'mon. All right, hide you here behind the tree, see? You're hidden here behind the tree. And you'll poke your head out just like you were spying on someone, see, right there. All right so when the little girl sees him spying, then she comes running towards him, surely he's got to say something. - I hope you don't expect him to speak. At least not while he's here. If you want the little boy to speak, send him away. - Oh, I'll go, I'd be delighted to, there's nothing I'd like better. - Hey, wait a minute, where are you going? Stick around! - I have nothing to do with all this. - What do you mean you have nothing to do with all this? - There's no need to hold him, he won't go anywhere. - He has to play the scene with his mother. - I won't play anything, I told you so from the beginning, now let go of me, please. - Let him go. Well, go. You see, he can't. He must remain here, he's chained to us forever. It's time to play the scene. - Larry, come here and tape this. - Prepare to roll tape. - Okay, momma, it's time. Do what you have to do, play the scene. - Just leave me out of this. I won't take part in you sorted little drama. - Force him to play! - No, no one can force me to do anything. - I'll force you. - Wait a minute, wait a minute first the girl in the fountain. Oh my darling. You're frightened, aren't you? You don't even know where we are. It's a set! What's a set? Oh, it's a place where people pretend, where they put on scenes, and we have a scene. A very serious one. And you're in it, baby. Oh, my darling, what an ugly scene there is to play and what a horrible part there is for you in it. See, to them it's all an illusion. A game, a joke. But not to you, my little darling. To you it's a real fountain that you play by. With lovely trees, and lots of little ducks swimming around breaking the shadows with trails of ripples. You want to play with the little ducks? Okay. No, Rosetta. No, no, no, no. (sobbing) No. What are you doing there always? With you hands in your pockets? It'll be your fault too if the baby drowns. What have you got there? Let me see it. You little idiot. If I'd have been in your shoes, instead of killing myself, I'd have killed one of them. - Good, that was wonderful, wonderful. Now in the meantime, the mother and son. - Whoa, whoa, what is this in the meantime? I tell you, there was no scene between her and me, now ask her, she'll tell you the same thing. - Yes, that's true, I went into his room. - Into my room, not into the garden. - Yes, that doesn't matter. I told you we're going to consolidate the scene. - What do you want? - Nothing, I was just watching you. - And you, you're watching her, is that it? To play her part? - Yes, I am. - Look, you oughta be grateful for their interest. - Sure, thanks a lot. Hasn't it dawned on you yet? That you'll never be able to tape this play because there's nothing of us in you at all? You see us only from the outside. That's absurd. Don't you see, I can't live in front of a mirror which not only does not reflect my likeness, but instead throws back my image. Twisted, and distorted into something grotesque. I, I don't know what else to call it. - He's right you know, he's absolutely right. - All right, all right, move away for a little while. Please move away. - That's quite all right, I'm in no hurry. - Please you be quiet, let me help your mother. Now then, you went into his room. - Yes, I couldn't stand it any longer. I went into his room to, to empty my heart of all the anguish that was tormenting me but as soon as I came in, I- - I ran away, I ran away in order to prevent the scene, because I never make scenes. - It's true, that's what happened. - Yes, but we've got to have this scene. Mother and son, this is the recognition scene. - Don't you think I want it too? If you could persuade him to talk to me, to talk to me just for a few minutes so I could tell him everything that's in my heart. - You've got to do it. You've got to do it for your mother's sake. - I'm not going to do anything! - For God's sake, do it! - No, no, no! - Don't you hear your begging you? - No, no, no, no! - What kind of son are you? - No, no, no, no! - You've got to play your part (woman screaming) - What is all this? - You're crazy, you know, you're crazy.
