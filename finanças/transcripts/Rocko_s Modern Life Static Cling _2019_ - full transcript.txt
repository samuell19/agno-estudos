A special surprise, eh? I bet I can guess what it is. Ed, will you get that? Mr. Bighead, Nosey of Newschunk News here. How does it feel, knowing your math mistake has just taken down all of Conglom-O? What? I haven't made a mistake in 20 years. I'm too big to fail! And since Conglom-O makes up 95% of our city's economy, O-Town is doomed. Oh, hang on a second, folks. This just in, Ed's boss, Mr. Dupette, has just issued the following statement. "Bighead, you're fired!" Oh, no, that sounds serious. Fired? But I... Hello. We're here to make room for the new unemployment office. You have 24 hours before we demolish your house. - Have a nice... - Gah! This isn't happening. Say this isn't happening! I must be having a nightmare. Hi, Mr. Bighead. Long time, no see. Ed, honey, I invited Rocko over for lunch. I hope you don't mind. Excuse me. What's wrong with Mr. Bighead? Oh, just that his life is crumbling like a dry manure pile in the hot sun and he sees no hope, that's all. I can relate. I can't watch my favorite TV show, The Fatheads. Fatheads? Yeah, yeah, The Fatheads. That's right. Your son Ralph made it. Maybe he can help me out? Ralphie... My boy... Even with all the success of The Fatheads, I'm just not happy. I need to get away for a while, do some real soul-searching, and find the real me. I promise I'll write. Good luck, son. I packed a fly sandwich for you, dear. Rocko, honey, Ralph went off to find himself years ago. Oh. Excuse me. I... I have to go check on the mashed potato bugs. This is terrible! No more Ralph means no more Fatheads. Mr. Bighead, please. There must be something you can do to bring them... I mean, him back. Your Ralphie needs you. I need you! His show is all I have! Uh, oh, uh... Uh, sorry. Rocko, an old cartoon isn't going to solve the kinds of problems you have. Mr. Bighead, The Fatheads wasn't just a cartoon. Your son created a cultural icon that resonated with millions of people! There's a huge audience out there clamoring for this show to come back, and whoever gives it to them is going to make millions... no, billions! Oh, Rocko, you're a genius! Ralph can make Conglom-O a new Fatheads special! It'll be a huge hit. It'll save my job, my house, and all of O-Town! And I can watch my old show again! They'll never listen to me. I've just been fired! But you! You're a fan, and today's fans have power! Rocko, I need you to email-text that ram-toodle-schmuck schmeepen-bloop your support to bring back The Fatheads. Or we could just go talk to them. Now, Rocko, Mr. Dupette is very, let's say, um, particular. I knew a beaver was gonna kill me someday. Grandpa, you're already dead, remember? I'll tell you when I'm dead! Why, back in my day, when you were dead, you were really dead. Not this... Where'd you go, Rocko? Heffer and I went gluten-free, I've reunited with my lovely wife. Hi, Rocko! I've upgraded, accessorized, and interfaced my platforms, plus reset and forgotten so many passwords, I think I'm going viral! We're awaiting test results. Sorry to interrupt your little tea party, but we're only dealing with the fate of the entire town right now! Mr. Bighead and I are gonna bring back The Fatheads. - You guys should come along. - Neat! Sorry, Heffer promised we'd look after his grandfather's ghost for the afternoon. Filburt! Grandpa possessed another lawn gnome! Try and catch me, fatso! Whoa! Oh, woe is me! I'm ruined! Whatever shall I do? I've lost everything but my sweet, sweet, booger jar. Um, Mr. Dupette? What more do you people want from me? It's, um... It's, uh, Ed Bighead, sir. Ed Bighead? - Oh! - What are you doing here? I thought I just fired you! Oh, yes, sir. You did, you did, but I, uh... We think we can save your company, Mr. Dupette. What is that, Bighead? Is that a mouse? I'm a wallaby. Um, Mr. Dupette, do you think Conglom-O TV could bring back The Fatheads? The Fatheads? The Fatheads? That show sold millions of toys and fruit squishies, didn't it? Yes, I'll bring back The Fatheads. Why didn't I think of it sooner? I'll get my people on this right away! You... your people? Uh, well, we were thinking we could get Mr. Bighead's son Ralph to make it. After all, he created The Fatheads. Too expensive! Conglom-O is broke! We might even have to sell the men's executive washroom toilet to make this thing. My people can do it cheap. They have computers. Oh, yes, a Fatheads refresh! - So chic! - So retro! We make many a TV show. Away, riff-raff creature! Make art is easy with computers. Oh, so easy! Bighead, you're re-hired. If this thing flops... Oh! This is my last chance, Rocko. This cartoon has to be good. But, Mr. Bighead, if Ralph doesn't make The Fatheads, the special will flop. Flop? Those guys will ruin The Fatheads! No! Okay, Mr. Bighead, Heffer, Filburt and I will go find Ralph. You stall the chameleons. Don't let them release that cartoon! Little beaver thing! I'm a wallaby. Congratulations on your fabulous idea to save O-Town by bringing back The Fatheads. What do you have to say to your adoring fans? Fans? I just wanted to see new Fatheads. We love Rocko! We love Rocko! We love Rocko! That's him! I just wanted my show back! You heard it here first, folks. O-Town is saved! Did you get the shot? Hello, Internets. It's me, FishSticks96, with my trusty selfie-o-matic cranial attachment. Whoa! My reality is virtual! Anyway... We're going on an epic quest to find the great Ralph Bighead. It's too real! The details! Whoa! Subscribe to my channel to follow our inspirational... The grotesquerie! The horror! I want my mommy! Spunky! Get away from that Internet thing! It'll hurt you! Oh, Rocko, darling! I have something to share with you! It's about my little Ralphie. Do you know where he went? Well, my boy sends picture postcards to his dear mother. Wow. China, Egypt, Italy... Oh, uh, that's not supposed to be there. Looks like he's been all over the world. And this is the last picture I have of him. Oh, bring back my little tadpole, Rocko. His mother and father miss him so very much. I want to, Mrs. Bighead, but how are we gonna get to all these places? Why don't we just take the rocket? We found the remote, remember? Whoops! Sorry. Too much kale salad. Ham dog! Spunky, what is it, boy? Do you know how to find Ralph? Did you just lose your remote-controlled flying mechanism? Well, you're in luck! Drone-O-Rama! You strike me as the kind of couple that knows a quality drone when you see it. Let me interest you in our econo-drone. Excuse me. Have you seen this toad? Can't an elephant bathe in peace? You nasty, nasty tourists! Thank you. - Have you seen him? - No! No. Yes, we've seen him. No, we haven't! No, we haven't. Can I go for a ride? Yes, you can. No, he can't! No, no, you can't. Nope. Haven't seen him. No. No. No! Nein. Nyet. Iie. No, absolutely not! How will we ever find Ralph? I think we're out of places to look. I think I'm out of witty banter. I think we're out of batteries. Whoo-hoo! Pillows, culturally ambiguous pillows, soft and fluffy. We're okay. We're okay! We're okay! Work harder, you worms! Faster! They're making a cartoon? Shouldn't they be using pencils or something? Ha! Welcome to the 21st century, Bighead! We have the best computers, ja? We can make anything in a passionless and cheap way. I'm sweating, I'm hot, I'm nauseous. Oh, now we'll never find Ralph Bighead. This is just terrible, Heff. I'll say. I'm not getting any cell phone reception out here. Fellas? Do you see what I see? Ah! Fried chicken dancing with pizza slices around an orange soda fountain? No, not the mirage. That thing! Whoo-hoo! Ice cream truck! Would you guys like an ice-cold pop? You betcha! Here you go. Ooh. Thank you. How about you? Your voice sounds so familiar... Ralphie! You're Ralph Bighead! We've been looking all over the world for you, Ralph! - Really? - Yeah, really, like, sheesh. Everywhere. Why would you be looking for me? Well, you see, we've been gone for quite some time... Thank you! Oh, boy. See, we were floating around the universe for the past 20 years... Oh, that's good. Oh, I really needed this. Um, well, what Filburt's trying to say is everything's changed so much that I just need one thing that used to be here. Would you bring back The Fatheads, or at least a special? Yeah, I don't think so. Wait! But you're the only one in the world who could... Ralph! Ralph! Ralph, wait! Why not? Why would I bring back The Fatheads? I'm not about cartoons anymore. Now I only sell Fatheads freezy-pops. Here, have one. But this doesn't even look like Mr. Fathead. That's because it's Mrs. Fathead. They're off-model, but they sell. Get off my truck, Rocko. If Conglom-O doesn't have a new hit, then your dad will lose his job, but most importantly, your parents will lose their house! Their house? Who's got little tadpole tootsies? Aww, he damaged my retina. Aww... Okay. Okay? I'll do it for my parents, but since the last time I saw them, I've... changed. I'm not Ralph anymore. I'm Rachel. Wow, cool! That is awesome. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Where to? Conglom-O, Heff! - Roger. - Roger? I thought your name was Rachel. Away we go! Hello! I'm talking to you. Are you listening? Oh, yes, I am listening. That is not the right line. Oh, isn't it funny? I am laughing so hard right now. If I had pants, I would be wetting them. It stinks. Bighead, open a window. Huh? Oh, yes, sir. ♪ She'll be riding six white horses ♪ ♪ She'll be riding six white horses ♪ Ah, a little fresh air. Good idea. Pillows, culturally ambiguous pillows, soft and fluffy. I think I broke my leg. You don't have a leg. You will receive our invoice! No, no, wait a minute. Bighead, why did you convince me to hire those idiots? We obviously need the creator to do this right! We sent for him. He should be here... We're back! I like your efficiency, Bighead. Oh, just in time. Bighead, nice to meet you. Cool shoes. Thanks. We need you to work your magic. Your father will fill you in on all the details. Ed, you're still in charge. Make this happen. Hello, son? Hi, Dad. Welp, I'm going on vacation. This is the most work I've done in years. Good luck, Bigheads! Let me know when the special's done! But what... what goes on here? Where's my son? I'm not your son. I'm your daughter, and I'm finally happy. This is crazy! No! Yes. No. Yes. Ah! I can't do this. I have no daughter! Dad... My son made the show. No son, no show. There will be no Fatheads special. I quit! Rachel, I'm sure he didn't mean those things. Uh, Mr. Bighead? But what about Conglom-O? Who cares? Wait! Mr. Bighead, I need a Fatheads special! I can't do it! I can't handle all of this, this... this... this... Change? Hey, can anybody break a five? All this change stops now! Wait! Mr. Bighead... Why don't you go back to the '90s, where you belong? Come back, Mr. Bighead! Rocko, how does it feel to have single-handedly brought down Conglom-O and therefore all of O-Town? I just wanted my show back. Down with Rocko! Down with Rocko! - Down with Rocko! - Rocko stole my socks! There he is! That's the dog who brought down O-Town! I'm a wallaby! Yeah, the nerve of them. Geez, you're right, Rocko. You're the wallaby who brought down O-Town. Heffer! Whoops. Sorry. Well, I'm outta here. Rachel, wait! I'm sure your dad didn't mean all of that. No, Rocko, I'm done. I'm not needed here. I'll go back to selling freezy-pops. Rachel, wait! Well, that was sad. I know! I really wanted another Fatheads freezy-pop. Oh, Ed, I wish you'd be more open-minded. I think it's great what Rachel has done. I'm sure she's much more comfortable with herself. Plus, I just found these shoes in her size. Aren't they adorable? It's not just that, Bev. I've lost my job, I'm losing my house, and now, Ralph is Rachel? I'm suffering from an extreme case of TMC, Too Much Change! Is there a window open? I can't believe this. Everything is so different, and now I can't even watch The Fatheads again. Aww, cheer up, Rocko. There's lots of entertainment to be had. Yeah, Rocko. Don't underestimate the hours of fun we can have making warped selfies! Pose it! Pose it! Click it, click it! Head swap! Hey, you've gained a little weight, Filburt. Hey, shell boy. Don't forget to spawn. Technology is fun. Who's got little tadpole tootsies? He damaged my retina. Aww... Another shipment of mops. Sicko. Oh, Spunky. At least you'll always stay the same. Mr. Bighead? Are you on the roof? Go away. Mr. Bighead, I'm not feeling too good, either. Oh, Rocko, leave me alone. I'm a failure. I feel like I let everyone down. You let yourself down, Mr. Bighead. You can live without the old job, and you can live without your house, but you can't live without a relationship with your child. Who are you? I am the "whinds" of change. Will you cut that out? We do not need your wind. Why are you here, Mr. Whinds of Change? I am here to tell you that embracing change is the key to happiness. You must go with the whinds of change. Listen, Mr. Blowhard, I don't like your wind, and I don't like change, so why don't you just take your bogus breeze and float away? Yeah, I don't like change either, Mr. Whinds. I'm also having a hard time. You see, I was stuck in space for 20 years, and... Silence! Let me tell you something else philosophical from my latest online book. You see, the nature of change is... Excuse me a moment. I have to take that. Hello? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, um, yeah. Uh, what? Oh, yes, of course. Uh, it's for you, Rocko. Me? Oh, uh... Uh, hello? Rocko, where you been? We've been trying to reach you. Oh, me? Uh, well, we're here on the roof, and the, uh, whinds of change is here. She did it, Rocko! Rachel finished the Fatheads special! They're gonna put it on the air in ten minutes, Rocko. Come on down to Conglom-O and see it! Yeah, there's a party, and popcorn, and they're showing the special on a huge screen. Give it back, you fat bovine! I got more to say, shell-back! And there's sauce from Bora Bora. Uh, well, I don't know. I think Mr. Bighead needs me. And, Rocko, Rachel is here! Uh... We gotta go now, Rock. We're having technical difficulties. I am taking the phone! No, you doesn't! Give me the phone, Filburt! So then I said, "Is that a melon in your pocket, or just a bad case of..." Well, that's unfortunate. Yes. Rachel finished the Fatheads special, Mr. Bighead. They're airing it in a few minutes, and they're showing it at Conglom-O. You go, Rocko. You probably made it happen. I sure didn't. You're going with me. Negatory. There's no way you'll ever get me to go down there... Oh, wait. What... what... what are you doing? Sorry, Mr. Bighead, but you've got a party to attend! Unhand me! Let me go! Let me go! Whinds of change, blow us to the premiere party, please! Well, I still had some more whords of whisdom, but okay. Oh, that wind came out of the wrong end. Oh, little weenie man! Yoo-hoo! And that's why I decided to have that work done, dear. It's much firmer. Hey, look, here comes Rocko! Hey, Rock. You... you brought potatoes? It's Mr. Bighead. Cool! Get your hands off me! Take your seats, everyone! The first Fatheads special in 20 years is about to begin. Yeah, Fatheads! Hey, everybody. Who's stuck in a nostalgia hole, huh? We are! Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Fatheads. Oh, I love the Fatheads! It's genius! Those Fatheads are oh-so-funny, eh? But look, what's this? There appears to be a new Fathead. A baby Fathead. What? A baby Fathead? There's no baby Fathead. We want the old Fatheads. Isn't he a cutie? Oh! Oh, look, baby Fathead is playing with the vacuum! And he's so cute! I just want to... Oh, look, it appears that there's a touching moment with baby Fathead and his parents. Let's watch. Hmm? Who's the cutest little baby Fathead? Coochie-coochie-coo! Tickle-tickle! Who's got little tadpole tootsies? Oh, look, he's damaged my retina. So long, hosers. Thank you, thank you. I just want to thank all the little people. Hooray! Yeah, hooray. Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Listen to me. This is not right! This isn't just new Fatheads, it's different Fatheads! We can't like this. You! You changed it, Rachel. You changed The Fatheads! It's too much change. Rocko, let me tell you something. The nature of change is... Let me take this, Mr. Gassy Cloud-Thing, whatever you are. Rocko, we can't live in the past. We can be grateful for it, but life isn't permanent, and if we don't embrace what's now, we miss out on a lot of the important stuff. But... Okay. I guess change is okay. Hooray! Hooray! Ooh, let's sing a song about change! Ah, change is still caca. Whoa! It's raining money! Hey! Conglom-O profits, free for the taking! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. This is the fruit of capitalist redundancy! Isn't all of this looting illegal? What do you mean? Everybody's happy! We love this country! So long! Bye, Rocko. Rachel, that was terrific. Thank you. Are you going back to selling Fathead pops? No, I've got more important things to do now. Ed... This kind of looks like you first thing in the morning. Hey... I resemble that comment. Oh, Ed. - So long! - Good luck. Well, it's your old boy, FishSticks96, at the end of my journey. I hope to someday meet my five loyal subscribers. You can! My family! I love you! Neat! I love you, Grandpa. Eh, you still smell like sweaty eggs. Well, what an exciting ending, but let's talk to the one who made it all happen, Really Really Big Man. Big, how does it feel to send everyone on this amazing journey with your superpowers? Oh. It's my duty. But I must say, my nipples sure are tired. Understandably so. Well, there you have it.
