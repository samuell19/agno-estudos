(Multicom Jingle) (slow somber music) (bell rings) - [Morgan] In the spring of 1945, as the Allied armies advanced toward victory, they stumbled upon the German concentration camps. Few are prepared for the hell they encounter. (slow dreary music) - [Woman] The soldiers came up to the fence and just stood there looking at us. I couldn't understand their behavior at all. I wish I could tell you how eerie that was watching them staring at us in that inexplicable way. But then I saw one of the soldiers double over and throw up. Soon, another was doing the same, and then another. And then I understood. They were looking at us in disgust. A deep despair came over me. I felt like Adam when he first knew he was naked, horrible and ashamed. I looked around me and saw myself and the other prisoners for the first time through the eyes of those soldiers. We were disgusting to look at, no doubt about it. It's odd isn't it that I had never realized that before? A moment after that first soldier threw up, a strange thing happened among the prisoners, we began turning away from them. We turned our backs to them. We didn't want them to see us. And if a short while before we had in some dim kind of way wanted them to come into the camp, now very strongly we wanted them to stay where they were. Or else to go away. - [Man] When you see them, there's nothing to distinguish them, you know. Shaved heads and sunken cheeks, there's no way. It's hard to even see them as human. Under the circumstances, you try to avoid seeing them too much. It's hard to do. (slow somber music) - [Woman] I took a few steps away from the soldiers when I heard a sound that was terrible, which I could not at first identify, even though in some strange, remote way, it seemed familiar to me. And I understand. My daughter was crying. For the first time in three years, this little child was crying. She was crying so hard that I thought her thin little body would collapse under the force of its convulsions. I tell you, I've never in my life heard any cry of pain like that child's. It was the most tragic wail I've known. And I? I followed my daughter's example. I sat down with her and for several minutes I screamed. (crowd yells angrily) - [Man] Control was gone after the sites we saw. The men were deliberately wounding guards, and then turning them over to the prisoners and allowing them to have their revenge. - [Man] Our first act as free men was to throw ourselves onto the provisions. We thought only of that, not of revenge, not of our families, nothing but bread. - [Man] When I was liberated, we ate and ate and ate. No feeling when it's enough, just the knowledge that I'm hungry and maybe tomorrow I won't have. We didn't know how to stop. - [Morgan] In their frenzy to fill themselves, many survivors ruptured their stomachs. Others who have hung so tenaciously to life, no longer have the strength to fight off the typhus and tuberculosis that raged through the camps. Within a few weeks of the arrival of the Allies, thousands of the liberated prisoners perish. At Bergen-Belsen alone, there are 13,000 corpses to bury. (slow troubled music) - [Man] I didn't feel anything at all except Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ. I kept saying that to myself because I couldn't think of anything else. You got over feeling that these were people anymore. They were so thin, so dried up that they might have been monkeys or plaster of Paris. You had to keep saying to yourself, these are human beings. Even when you said it, your mind was not believing it because nothing like this had ever happened before. It just couldn't happen. (slow chanting music) (wind howls) - [Morgan] The liberators razed the camps and tried to put the mass graves and the stench of death behind them. The Jews watch the flames and wondered what lies ahead. - [Man] What specimens of humanity they are, after the treatment they have received. I am certain that 90% of those who survive will never really be normal. They have suffered too much. - [Man] It was on the last month. My brother, older than me, came to the fence of my barrack, and told me, "We don't have the parents anymore. "The only one you had was me, but now they take me away. "We will never meet again. "I don't believe this hell will take an end. "I don't see any light in the edge of this tunnel. "You are adult enough." I was almost eight years old. "To understand what I'm telling you, "I want you to know that if a miracle will happen, "and they will come and you will survive this hell, "there is a place on the world named Eretz Israel. "Repeat the name, and don't forget it. "Eretz Israel, the Land of Israel. "This is our old homeland. "This is the place where they don't kill the Jews. "So if you survive, tell anybody whom you meet "that they have to take you to that particular place." Eretz Israel. ("American Patrol" by Glenn Miller) - [Morgan] In New York, Americans revel in their victory in Europe. In London, they crowd the squares to cheer the end of six long years of war. Even in Palestine, there's dancing in the streets. The day of victory, sad, very sad, writes David Ben-Gurion in his diary. Like other leaders of of world Jewry, the chairman of the Jewish Agency in Palestine has watched the war from afar, helpless to avert the slaughter of six million European Jews. (singing in foreign language) To the Jews, Eretz Israel is a land in which they have had a continued 3,000 year presence. Even after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and expelled them in the second century, Jews remained faithful to their dream of returning to their Biblical homeland. The Arabs invaded Palestine in the seventh century and remained there even though the land was conquered and reconquered. As more and more Europeans Jews began to flee to Palestine to escape Hitler, the Arabs grew fearful that the Jews might become a majority. ("Scotland and the Brave" by Harry Lauder) Since World War I, Britain has administered this divided land under a league of nations mandate, trying to appease both the Arabs and the Jews and protect its own imperial interests in the Middle East. Although Britain at first promised to establish a national homeland for the Jews, under pressure from the Arabs, it changed its policy. In 1939, the British issued a White Paper severely restricting Jewish immigration. In June 1945, the British were allowing no more than 1,500 Jews to enter Palestine each month. World War II has left Europe in ruins. In Germany, some 11 million refugees wander through a nightmare land of famine, disease, and desperation. Allied troops tried to impose some semblance of order on the anarchy and chaos they find. (gun fires) The refugees come from all over Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and the Baltic states. They include former slave laborers, concentration camp inmates, military conscripts, and prisoners of war. They are officially classified as displaced persons. Jews make up about 100,000 of the DPs, but as soon as they are strong enough to travel, many return home to search for their families. - [Woman] The body, the marvel of the body. It heals with unbelievable speed. At the liberation I weighed 62 pounds. I couldn't stand on my feet. And months later, I went home on my own. It is beyond words to describe what the human body is, what a human being is. (slow stirring music) - I was so anxious to go home and see if I'm alive, I hope that my parents and my brothers will come home too. I got home, I didn't find anybody yet. When young men my brother's age started coming home, we ran to them as fast as we had the strength. And I had a million questions to ask. Boys, did you work together with my brothers? Did you see them? Did you hear about them? I didn't know where to stop, so many questions. Those young men didn't say a word. Finally, I stopped asking questions, and they look at me very sad, and they said Livia, I'm sorry, your brothers won't come home. What, I couldn't believe it. What do you mean? And know after 51 years, I still think how could I be so dumb for so, being so surprised. And while I was in Auschwitz, 3 1/2 months, I saw daily people being, women, being killed for no reason at all. (slow somber music) - [Man] Our houses were destroyed because after we were deported, the Gentiles started to search for gold. They razed the houses and dug pits to look for it. I met one man who I'd known before the war, and he asked me, "Why did the Germans leave you alive? "Why didn't they turn you into soap?" After hearing that I understood that there was no longer a place for me here. - [Man] We were hated because we returned from the dead. They thought of us as dead and buried. They were quite satisfied there were no more Jews and no more Jewish problem. Our return was a painful surprise to them. They looked upon us as ghosts. No one loves ghosts. - [Woman] The Czechs looked at you, how dare you come back. In Poland, the anti-Semitism was worse. There, they killed you for coming back. - [Morgan] In a village near Vilna, five of the few Jews who have survived the war are found murdered. Their bodies are brought to Vilna for burial. Stuffed into some of their pockets is a message written in Polish, this will be the fate of all the surviving Jews. (train hisses and chugs) By the end of the summer, millions of refugees find their way back to their homes and loved ones. (slow riveting music) Only the Jews have nowhere to return. - [Man] All those days we had struggled to survive, hour after hour, day after day. There had been no time to grasp the enormity of our tragedy. Now, everything became clear. No longer were our families waiting for us. No homes to go back to. For us, the victory had come too late, much too late. - [Morgan] Homeless and unwanted, Jewish survivors begin to converge on America zone of Germany and Austria. Over 500 assembly centers are hastily set up in former slave labor camps, stables, fields, wherever the Allies can find space. The smallest centers hold 50 to 500 refugees, the larger, more than 5,000. The DPs were assigned to camps according to their country of origin. Jews are mixed in with the general population of displaced persons, Lithuanians, Latvians, Ukrainians, Croatians, Estonians, many who had voluntarily entered Germany during the war years to aid the Nazis. The man in the next bed could well be a Nazi sympathizer, or collaborator, or even murderer. American General George S. Patton, Jr., insists that every camp be surrounded by barbed wire and manned by armed guards to watch over the detainees. (slow reserved music) - [Man] When I look out my window, I see the barbed wire. My heart grows cold. And when I go with my pop to go get my meals I feel as though I'm still in concentration camp. - [Morgan] Everywhere, DPs lack basic supplies and amenities. Food is meager and clothing is scarce. The occupying troops are unprepared to deal with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who speak a babble of languages and have suffered unimaginable anguish and degradation. Untrained to handle the DPs, the soldiers fall back on what they know best, military discipline. (man coughs) (slow melancholic music) - [Man] I saw that my family was dead, and the Germans were still alive. And I asked if there was a God, how could this happen? So many people needed a helping hand, and no one cared. People committed suicide. There was no one to help us adjust. - [Woman] Why am I alive? I don't know. Maybe this is a punishment. At this moment I am alone, and I have nobody, and I am living. - [Woman] We were weak, we were starving. We were in a state of apathy. We simply sat and stared into space. - [Man] It is better to be a conquered German than a liberated Jew. - [Man] I am angry at the world. The world stood still when we were burning. So much pain, so much pain. How to get rid of it? - When I arrived in Dachau, I had no assignment of any kind. No one told me what to do. And I watched the doctors and nurses as they went about their rounds. And I felt completely lost, in the sense that here were people working endlessly trying to save whatever souls they could. And I was unable to be part of that team. I began to walk up and down the row of barracks wondering what was I going to do? And finally, I forced myself into a barrack. I opened the door and I came into this dark room where the people were still in their concentration uniforms, and were still living on shelves. A voice came from one of the shelves. And it was a very thin, weeping voice, and it said, "I had a brother, we lived together." And he told me the community in which they lived. "And then he left us and went to the United States, "and he became a rabbi." And the voice asked, "Do you know my brother?" No name was given, except as the voice came towards me, I was attracted by the timbre of the voice, the weeping in the voice. And before the voice was through, I said, "Yes, I know your brother." And then the voice said to me, "Don't say things that are not true just to console me." I said, "I'm not consoling you. "I'm going to bring your brother to you." And I rushed out of the barracks because I couldn't cope with the situation. I was afraid of it. But when I got outside, I was so sure that I had put the two voices together that I was satisfied that I came to Dachau. If nothing else, what ever happened, I had done something. - [Morgan] In reuniting the survivor and his brother, now an Army chaplain, Rabbi Klausner discovers how he can help the DPs. What they want most is to reconnect to their families and their community. Klausner establishes a committee of survivors to compile lists of Jews still alive in Germany. The thousands of names are published under the title Sharit Ha-Platah, the Surviving Remnant. The six volumes are sent to Jews throughout the world, Europe, America, Palestine. (mid-tempo lively music) - [Soldier] Halt! - [Morgan] Besides the chaplains, the other representatives of the free Jewish world to reach the camps are soldiers from Palestine. Near the end of the war, England reluctantly allows them to fight with the British Army in Europe under the banner of the Jewish Brigade. - [Man] We saw a jeep out which jumped two soldiers in uniforms of the Brigade with stars of David on their sleeves. The joy was great. The openness, the connection between us is something that happens only once in one's life. And perhaps only at a specific time, perhaps only then. - [Morgan] But like the Allied liberators before them, many of the Brigade are appalled by the condition of the survivors. - [Man] We found a community of living persons who had mental terms were not much different from the bodies we had found. 5,000 Jews like these could turn Eretz Israel into a lunatic asylum. I did not believe that these souls would ever be healed. (slow soft music) - [Morgan] The first Jewish from the concentration camps to reach Palestine are children who the Allies ordered to be removed from Germany without delay. - A month after our liberation, we were already on our way through Germany and France to go to Eretz Israel. The British authorities took us by train from the port to Atlit, a camp where we were surrounded with fence and nobody could enter. But because we were legal, all the papers printed our names. This was the headline, of course. First survivors of Holocaust came to Eretz Israel, all of them orphans. Our names and the names of cities we come from were printed in all the places in Eretz Israel. I will never forget the shouts, the beggings of very many people surrounding our camp behind the fence, crying out the names of their families and their cities. Greenberg, Warsaw, Goldberg, Kruker! And we were only and the first, the source of information if we have met them in a ghetto, in the death camp, in the concentration camp, in one of the trains. - [Morgan] But the world has other priorities. (upbeat lively music) - [Announcer Of Newsreel] The biggest political surprise of 40 years was the result of the general election. Very few indeed thought that when the ballot boxes left for safekeeping at the police stations, the count would reveal the most sensational landslide since 1906. - [Morgan] The British voters turn out Winston Churchill's wartime Conservative Party and elect Clement Attlee's Labor Party to direct the peacetime recovery. Attlee appoints Ernest Bevin as foreign secretary of the new government. - When I saw thing results this morning, I uttered a feeling of thankfulness that the British electorate had put an end to the very conception of personal government in this country. (audience cheers and applauds) - [Morgan] Jewish leaders have high hopes that the new government will ease restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. But the economic and social conditions of post-war England force Labour to reexamine its previous policies. Having spent a quarter of her national wealth on the war effort, Britain is now virtually bankrupt. With shortages everywhere, oil becomes a crucial commodity, and oil is to be found only in the Arab world. (slow reserved music) By the late summer, reports of the conditions of the DP camps begin to reach government officials in London and Washington. - A colonel walked in, and he said, "Chaplain, I have something to tell you, "there's a very important person coming "from the United States. "He's being sent by the president." He told me that. "And he's going to visit the sites, "and my responsibility was to draw up his agenda, "and I want to show it to you." And I looked at it, and of course, I realized that he was going to be not shown the scene. He realized and I realized what was going on between the two of us. And he told me, "I'm sorry, Chaplain. "I can't do otherwise in terms of the military, "but you can, and I tell you what I'm going to do. "I'm gonna bring him to Dachau. "you're going to be there. "I'm going to introduce him to you, "and you take it from there." - [Morgan] The man Klausner takes around the camps is Earl G. Harrison, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, who has been appointed to find out how the US Army is treating the people it has supposedly liberated. Harrison is outraged by what he sees and hears. (slow dreary music) - [Earl Portrayer] The camp is filthy beyond words. Sanitation is virtually unknown. With few exceptions, the people of the camp themselves appear demoralized beyond the hope of rehabilitation. - [Man] We are living like a litter of puppies cuddled under the body of their mother. - [Woman] When I undress at night, I can't help feeling everybody's looking at me. Sometimes, mother holds the blanket in front of me, but sometimes she's too tired. - [Morgan] After visiting 30 camps, Harrison files an interim report highly critical of the US Army's treatment of the survivors. - [Earl Portrayer] As matters now stand, we appear to be treating the Jews as the Nazis treated them, except that we do not exterminate them. They are in concentration camps in large numbers under our military guards, instead of SS troops. One is led to wonder whether the German people seeing this are not supposing that we are following, or at least condoning, Nazi policy. - [Morgan] Harrison urges the Army to recognize the Jews' unique experience of oppression and persecution and to house them in separate camps. He also urges that their food and clothing be radically improved and that they not be subject to Army discipline. In his final report to President Truman, Harrison stresses the Jews' desire to leave Germany and Austria, and suggests that the British admit 100,000 of them to Palestine. Truman responds to Harrison's report by cabling prime Minister Attlee and requesting, as a humanitarian gesture, immediate admission of 100,000 refugees to Palestine. Before the Harrison report is even made public, Attlee turns down Truman's request. (door thuds) - [Ernest] I'm very sorry I can't say anymore. - [Morgan] Five days later, the Cabinet approves Foreign Minister Bevin's recommendation that Jewish immigration to Palestine remain at 1,500 persons a month. (chanting in foreign language) Yom Kippur, 1945, the first Day of Atonement celebrated in freedom by the survivors. At Feldafing, the first all-Jewish DP camp, 5,000 Jews come together to pray. - [Man] The intensity of the prayers during that Yizkor service is something I shall never forget. Wails and crying of young and old, some mourning for a child that would never grow old, others for a parent that would no longer be there to guide them, others a brother or sister. It was as if only mourners attended these congregations. - [Morgan] After the service, the congregants welcome two surprise guests, Generals Eisenhower and Patton, who have come personally to inspect the camps. Rabbi Halberstam, the rabbi of Klausenburg, presents Eisenhower with salt and bread, the traditional welcome extended to a king. On the inspection tour, Eisenhower is distressed by the squalor of the camp. He makes it clear to Patton that he wants an immediate change in conditions. Although afterwards, Patton removes the Army military guard from the DP camps, he notes in his diary that it is a serious mistake. - [George Portrayer] If the Jews were not kept under guard, they would not stay in the camps. They would spread over the country like locusts and would eventually have to be rounded up after quite a few of them had been shot, quite a few Germans murdered and pillaged. Harrison and his ilk believe the DP is a human being which he is not. This applies particularly to the Jews who are lower than animals. - [Morgan] As the Harrison Report is released to the press, Eisenhower transfers Patton, signaling to all the military that anyone who does not follow his orders to treat the Jews differently will be held accountable. (mid-tempo band music) In the United States, the world's indifference to the survivors of the Holocaust unites the Jewish community. For the first time, practically every major Jewish organization supports a demand for a homeland in Palestine. (mid-tempo dramatic music) In Palestine, the British decision to maintain restricted immigration also unites the Jewish community. Now that the war is over, three mutually hostile underground groups ally to form the Resistance Movement. The militant Irgun is led by Polish immigrant Menachem Begin, whose parents and family were all murdered by the Nazis. The Irgun joins with the smaller Stern Gang, under the military leadership of Yitzhak Shamir, and the larger Haganah, a defense force which had been organized to protect settlers against Arab terrorism. They begin guerrilla attacks against Palestine railways and airfields and British military installations. (mid-tempo tense music) - [Newsreel Announcer] Jerusalem was the scene of more outrages. Bombs placed in the railway station resulted in the loss of more British lives. Shortly before the explosions, a girl had driven up in a taxi and deposited several suitcases in the station. And although the British sergeant removed one of them, and the other two blew up when he was taking them out and killed him instantly. Here are some of the men arrested for the alleged complicity in the murderous attack. They're all reported to be of Polish origin. - [Morgan] In Europe, the Haganah also steps up its activities to help bring the refugees to Palestine. - I was down in a town in southern Bavaria called Bad Tolz, and the phone rang, and a lady is on the phone. I was 27 years old, not married, no responsibilities, and when the lady says, "Would you come and meet me in Paris "in room 203 of the Royal Monceau Hotel?" I couldn't think of one good reason to say no, (chuckles) so I went. The minute that I saw the lady, I realized that one of my motives was certainly not to be fulfilled. She kept me out in the hall and said, "Will you work for us?" And I said, "Who's us?" And she said, "Haganah." Now, I knew what the word meant. I had no idea of what the implications would be of what she would request. Sometimes, you've got to say yes or no according to the gut, so I said yes. At that point, I was invited in. She sat me down and gave me my marching orders. I was shocked. She said, "Okay, here's what we want. "We're gonna be moving streams and streams "of surviving Jews, and we're gonna be bringing them "from far away in Eastern Europe. "We're gonna bring them to Germany, "and you're gonna become part of that process." - [Morgan] Eastern European Jews who had fled deep into Russia to escape the Nazis or who had fought with the partisans or hidden in the forests, now turn westward. Their route leads to the DP camps in the American zones of Germany and Austria, then to selected seaports and Palestine. This migration of refugees is called the Brichah, the Hebrew word for flight, and becomes the largest illegal mass movement in modern times. - Many a night, I would make the trip, leaving at dusk from my house in a convoy of six trucks and a couple of jeeps fore and a couple of jeeps aft, and up we would go. The loading, a matter of 20 minutes. If the people were carrying little bags or little suitcases, we'd throw everything away to make room for one more person, one more person on the truck. The specific thing that I needed in order to keep that operation going was cigarettes. Cigarettes was the currency of the black market. A package of cigarettes was worth $15, a carton, 10 packs, worth $150. It cost me one carton per Jew. That's $45,000 worth of cigarettes every single night. You had to bribe the Polish side, you had to bribe the Russians on the Russian side, and you had to dump the big bag full of 300 cartons of cigarettes on the ground and leave it there, and they divided it up among themselves. - [Man] The Fuhrer must have had full knowledge of what was happening with regard to concentration camps, the treatment of the Jews. (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] I already mentioned it as my opinion that the Fuhrer did not know about details in concentration camps. - [Man] I'm not asking about details. I'm asking about the murder of four or five million people. Are you suggesting that nobody-- - [Morgan] While the survivors struggle to build a future, an international military tribunal tries to assess guilt and punishment for the crimes the Nazis have committed. (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] I am still of the opinion that the Fuhrer did not know about these figures. ("Silent Night, Holy Night" by Franz Xaver Gruber) - [Morgan] On Christmas Eve, 1945, the Nazi defendants celebrate together in the second-floor double cell which has been converted into a chapel the accused war criminals feel certain that this is their last Christmas. Goering tells the others. - [Hermann Portrayer] If I've got to die, I'd rather die as a martyr than as a traitor. Don't forget that the great conquerors of history are not seen as murderers, Genghis Khan, Peter the Great, Frederick the Great. The time will come when the world will think differently about all this. - [Morgan] Nearly eight months after the miracle of liberation, the liberated Jews still wait for the world to welcome them back. But the Allies have made no significant strides toward emptying the DP centers. As the new year begins, there are 12 all-Jewish camps in the American zone, and with the influx of Eastern European Jews, the population grows. - The spirit of the people was prompted by the negative condition that was imposed upon them. It was like a man in a pit that wants to get out. Now they knew they weren't going to remain in Germany. The question is, where were they going to go? And they knew also, they learned very quickly, they had to be part of the battle. I wasn't that somebody was going to do something for them. They had to battle their way out. - [Man] My deep Zionist commitment helped me to overcome the psychological difficulties that many people suffered from the Holocaust. It want long after liberation that we began planning for the future. - [Morgan] Since the turn of the century, the goal of the Zionists has been to create a self-reliant Jewish community in Palestine. Now Zionist groups spring up in a number of camps. The Zionists even manage to establish a kibbutz, a collective agricultural training farm, for life in Palestine. - [Man] Through our physical labor in this kibbutz, we mean to demonstrate that we are not yet destroyed, but that we have the will to live and to build. - [Morgan] The camps become centers of Jewish cultural life, as well. The DPs establish schools that teach both Zionism and Judaism, the two sustaining faiths of the survivors. - [Man] Those of us who remain, those of who are the last remnant of our people, must once more have hope for the revival of all those values which we hold so dear. We owe that to the memory of our dearly beloved dead, who had the same yearnings. We owe it to them to spend our remaining days in creating a worthy life once more. - [Woman] It was an accident if you survived or not. The only thing you could contribute was not to be sorry for yourself, not to give in, not to let them hypnotize you into believing that you are something inferior. - [Man] We were young, together, and we wanted to enjoy life. There were some people who couldn't get rid of it. Some people are weaker and some are stronger. ♪ Don't be sad now ♪ ♪ Little on, little one ♪ ♪ I command you ♪ - [Man] We had people from 40 to 50 countries, people with different mentalities, different languages, different cultures, but in some way, we melted together to make one family. - My husband was a Polish survivor. He didn't have in the world anybody. Everybody got killed, brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, a wife and a baby. And when we met, we liked each other, kind of, so after four days, he proposed, and I accepted. (slow gentle music) - [Woman] There was at least one wedding every day at Bergen Belsen. People paired themselves because you had nobody. Out of loneliness, we got together. - [Woman] I came into the DP camp like a stranger, no family, no one to talk to. I felt so alone. I felt like a rock in the water, alone. I got married and pregnant, but I wasn't ready to make commitment. It was only because I was so lonely. Under normal circumstances, we would never have married. - [Morgan] Most of the survivors choose another survivor for a mate. - I didn't even have a dress, so I made myself a white skirt, and somebody lend me a white blouse. I don't even know on my head what I had. I didn't have a beautiful veil or anything, just maybe a scarf, who knows? And my husband, I don't know if he had a suit, even. - [Man] When there was wedding, the whole camp came to the wedding to celebrate, like we were all related. Every wedding was celebration for the whole camp. - And that was it. You know, about four girls shared the room in the camp, so they did me a favor, and they went to somewhere else, and we had our, our, you-know-what. Anyway, so, this was the wedding, and we lived happy for years. - [Morgan] In January 1946, the United States and England appoint a joint committee to investigate the problems of the refugees in relation to Palestine. The committee has six Americans and six British members. - I joined the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine as a foreign correspondent for the New York Post. We entered Germany. Then we talked to some of the people themselves, and we began to learn not only what they had suffered and what they'd gone through, but how they felt now, that they wanted to go to Palestine, that they had survived so that they could go to this county they felt was really their home. And a 16-year-old boy was furious with us. He said, "Why do you ask me these questions? "Why do I wanna go? "Why don't you ask the world that? "Everybody has a home. "The British have a home. "The French have a home. "The Americans have a home. "Only we don't have a home. "Ask the world why they don't let us go home." (singing in foreign language) - [Morgan] In a poll of over 19,000 Jewish DPs in Germany, 97% declare that they want to settle to Eretz Israel. When asked in a second poll to pick a second choice if Palestine is unavailable, hundreds write in crematorium. Bartley Crum, one of the American representatives on the committee, is deeply affected by the people he meets. - [Bartley Portrayer] I remember the clarity with which on witness put it. He explained that only the Zionist's goal could make the DPs work. They had done such inhumanely hard labor for the Nazis that their attitude to work could become positive again only when they were inspired by a great ideal. "I myself," he said, "would never have wanted "to work a day's work again in my life "if I were not imbued with the ideal of Palestine." - [Morgan] The committee moves on to the Mideast to interview both Jews and Arabs. Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization, is the first witness. - [Chaim Portrayer] Despite all promises by British and American statesmen and leaders, Jews are able to enter Palestine only as illegal immigrants. European Jewry cannot be expected to resettle on soil drenched with Jewish blood. Their only hope for survival lies in the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. - [Morgan] For the refugees, the clandestine route to Palestine leads over a hazardous 12,000-foot Alpine pass to Italy. (slow dreary music) - [Man] All night long, we struggled through the snow. Sometimes we were led on a path of sorts, but often there would be drifts across the path, through which adults waded waist-high, carrying the children. - [Woman] It was tough. Winter, we had to trudge for hours through the snow, hungry and frozen. We were exhausted, very exhausted. - [Man] This is a new type of person, tempered by incredible suffering. No matter how closely the borders are watched, these people will move from country to country toward the Mediterranean seaports. They are resolved that nothing will stop them. - [Morgan] Beyond the mountains remains the sea. Under cover of night, the refugees board leaky cargo ships secretly bound for Palestine. The boats are often purchased in the US and manned by American crews. - There I was, in the ivory tower of the Harvard Law School, and I became aware for the first time what had transpired in Europe, and I didn't see how I, as a Jewish boy, could stay there while history was being made. Harvard Law School would always be there. This was a moment in history. This was when the Jews were changing the world. They were leaving the ghettos of Europe, and they were going to go to Palestine. They were going to form their own state, and I had to be a part of that. They were pulled into our ship from shore in rubber rafts, all in complete silence, as if it were a movie film with the sound track cut off. Old people, young people, kids, they had to climb the ladders to come aboard the ship. And most of them were individuals who had no surviving members of their family. They each carried a water bottle and a small pack on their backs which were the sole possessions they had in the world. I remember a bearded gentleman, and I was urging him to get in and climb in, and he stopped me and he said to me in Yiddish, he said, and I will not say it in Yiddish. What he said to me was, wait a minute, he said, I was once master of my own house. And it really struck me that it was just by the sheerest blind fate that I was not in his position, that I was a well-fed American who had survived the war in comfort and was now directing him, could've been my father. (slow stirring music) - [Morgan] With 1,500 refugees crammed on board, the passengers are only allowed on deck in shifts. For most of the voyage, they remain cooped up in the holds to avoid detection by the British. (planes whir) - We saw a plane fly over us and it was a bomber and it crisscrossed over us several passes. We knew we'd been discovered by a British search plane. Then the people were permitted to come out on deck. Haganah had made the decision that if we were intercepted, we were to resist, and of course, we all agreed with that. First, we didn't intend to submit to this wrongful act on the part of the British and to accept what they were doing like sheep going to the slaughter or going meekly into the crematoria. We were going to fight them. Secondly, resistance was important to demonstrate to the world that we were not going to be, be impeded in our insistence upon going to our own country, to our own land. It was our right to go. The British Marines jumped aboard. They had shields. They had helmets. They had long clubs with lead on the end, and they had guns. And there was a fight. They succeeded in taking the wheelhouse and had the fighters segregated in groups, with guns pointed at them. (slow somber music) As we were towed into Haifa harbor, three of us dropped into the water. I was caught by a patrol boat after I'd been in the water about 10 minutes. - [Morgan] Beginning in 1945, 63 ships carrying nearly 90,000 refugees tried to cross the Mediterranean to the Promised Land. Only six managed to evade the British gunboats and reach the shores of Palestine undetected. The British take the severely wounded and injured to hospitals and transfer all the rest to detention camps. In May 1946, the Anglo-American Committee submits a unanimous report recommending the immediate admission of 100,000 Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Although President Truman promptly endorses the report, the British just as quickly dismiss it. Attlee tells the House of Commons that before any immigration into Palestine can take place, the Haganah and other illegal Jewish armies must disarm and disband completely. In June, at a Labour Party conference, Bevin adds. - [Ernest Portrayer] Regarding the agitation in the United States and particularly in New York for 100,000 to be put in Palestine, I hope it will not be misunderstood in America if I say with the purest of motives that that was because they do not want too many of them in New York. ("Stars and Stripes Forever" by John Philip Sousa) - [Morgan] In the United States, even though immigration is already severely restricted, many see the arrival of any foreigners as a threat to the American way of life. Patriotic groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars want to ban all immigration for a period of five to 10 years. Letters to the White House and Congress run seven to one against allowing DPs into the US. The word refugee is synonymous with Jew, and the latter is synonymous with Red, states one writer. A year after the defeat of Germany, the Communists replace the Nazis as America's chief enemy and its major concern abroad. To win German support in the battle against Communism, Secretary of State James Burns rides Hitler's train through Germany and sleeps in his compartment. In Stuttgart, he assures a group of industrialists that if they stand with the US in the Cold War, they will be able to keep their factories and industry. - The American people want to return the government of Germany to the people of Germany. The American people want to help the German people to win their way back to an honorable place among the free and peace-loving nations of the world. (audience applauds) (mid-tempo serious music) - [Morgan] Germans respond with relief to the secretary of state's message. They realize that the Americans will not punish German corporations for their complicity with Hitler. German industrialists who had used concentration camp inmates as slave laborers during the war are now given a second chance. The Americans are willing to overlook their crimes against the Jews, as long as they join in the economic war against Communism. The Western Allies are also willing to ignore the crimes of Hitler's other collaborators. During the war, the Nazis plundered millions of dollars in gold from the countries they conquered and the Jews that they murdered. After the war, fearing the spread of Communism, the US, England, and France award $44 million of the captured gold to Hitler's former allies Austria and Italy. Although money is also set aside to run the DP camps, the funding ends when Great Britain objects. (slow tense music) - [Newsreel Announcer] New day of crisis in Palestine, as the British complete an intensive search for weapons at a Jewish settlement at Yagur. Precipitating the recent waves of violence in Palestine was Britain's failure to carry out early recommendations to admit 100,000 homeless European Jews. - [Morgan] In Palestine, the 5,000 members of the Hebrew Resistance Movement respond to Attlee's call to disarm by escalating the violence against the British. ("Taps" by Daniel Butterfield) Convinced that only force will change British policies, members of the underground blow up bridges (explosion booms) and damage key industries in a declaration that they will no longer wait passively for the camps to be emptied. The British, with 80,000 troops and 20,000 policemen in Palestine, retaliate with drastic reprisals. At dawn, June 29, 1946, called Black Sabbath by the Jews, every available British soldier and policeman sweep down on the Jewish Agency headquarters and 25 settlements throughout the country. House by house, they searched for members of the Jewish Resistance. In all, they arrest 2,718 Jews and send them to internment camps without trial. But none of the Haganah commanders are captured. Menachem Begin, leader of the militant Irgun, decides that a counterattack is needed. (explosion booms) - [Newsreel Announcer] Palestine. At British Army headquarters in the fashionable King David Hotel, the ever-present unrest suddenly exploded. (explosion booms) One wing of the hotel demolished by a time bomb planted by agents of underground extremists. - [Newsreel Announcer] And casualties were very heavy. Leaders of the Jewish Agency have expressed horror at the dastardly crime perpetrated by a gang of desperadoes. - [Newsreel Announcer] As these first films of the tragedy were issued, the death tolls stood at 76. Among the casualties, high-ranking British officials, prominent Jews, and Arabs. - [Morgan] The final death toll reaches 91. And although the world condemns the terrorism, the mounting cost in lives and money undermines British resolve to continue its Colonial rule. (slow melancholic music) In Poland, the Jews who have remained also reconsider there future. On July 4, 1946, in Kielce, 41 of the town's 200 Jews are murdered after a nine-year old boy claims that he has seen Jews kill Christian children for ritual purposes. The lynch mob is led by members of the clergy and the local militia. - [Man] The Kielce Pogrom, that was a bitter one. A ripple went through all of Europe. - [Morgan] General McNarney, head of the US Forces in Europe, sends Rabbis Friedman and Philip Bernstein to Warsaw to determine how the murders might affect the refugee problem. The rabbis visit four of the most powerful figures in Poland. The first is the American ambassador. - You were either in favor of the state being established at some point under some set of conditions, or you were not in favor of it, and he was not in favor of it. And he said, "These damn Jews, they just, "they create problems all the time." - [Morgan] Second, they visit the Catholic cardinal. - He said, "I have nothing to tell you. "These Jews brought it on themselves. "They are all Communists." - [Morgan] The third person they see is the Polish prime minister. - And he said, "I can understand if these Jews want to flee." "I can understand if they want to flee toward Germany, "where the American flag is, and that represents safety. "I understand all of that, "but I can't do anything about it to help you." - [Morgan] Finally, they speak to the head of the Communist Party, who is a Jew. - [Herbert] And he said, "If there was a pogrom, there was a pogrom. "There have always been pogroms in Jewish history, "so what's the big deal? "There's nothing so terrible about it. "I'm sorry for it, but it's irrelevant in history." And we wrote the report that the military command in Germany could expect over the period of the next year to a year and a half, approximately 150,000 people to come flooding in from the East to the West. And if you want to close the borders and you want to try to prevent these Jews from coming in, then you're gonna have to do it by armed force. (singing in foreign language) - [Morgan] General McNarney sends Rabbi Bernstein to Washington to present the problem to the Commander in Chief. President Truman quickly makes his decision, keep the borders open. In the next three months, 90,000 people leave Poland and enter the American zone of Germany and Austria, hoping to immigrate to Palestine. - [Woman] Parting was difficult. This was the place where I was born and grew up. Watching the countryside I loved from the train window, I knew I would never come back. - [Man] We have wandered enough. We have worked and struggled too long on the lands of other peoples. Now we must build a land of our own. - [Morgan] Yet, life in the DP camps is hardly more secure than the life the Eastern European Jews have left behind. "The Germans killed us," says one refugee, "The British don't let us live." In the fall of 1946, David Ben-Gurion comes to Germany to inspect the situation for himself. Rabbi Friedman is asked to take him around the camps. - And I said to him, "What you have to do, "if I may be presumptuous, "what you have to do is try to lift the morale." And so he got up there. They were all standing, we didn't have seats. There were 5,000 people in the camp by now. He spoke to them in Hebrew for a few minutes. This sentence, I remember clearly. "I come to you with empty pockets." ANd he took his pockets of his trouser and pulled them out, you know, inside-out, to show them that they were empty, he had nothing there. "I have no certificates to give you." That meant, I cannot take you to Palestine in a legal way. "Therefore, I have to ask you for patience, "and I have to ask you to have hope, "because we want you, we need you." And then he went on in a beautiful way to give them the feeling that they were gonna be able to contribute to the building of the future state. And our song is Hope, Hatikvah is the song, the Hebrew word means hope. Now let's all sing Hatikvah. Now, he couldn't sing, he couldn't (laughs). And I have a monotone, as far as singing is concerned. The two of us were up there totally disarmed. I mean, I said to myself, oh, if we only had somebody who could start his song. But the song started from among the people. (singing in foreign language) And slowly but surely, the volume grew and grew, and it came to a great crescendo. During the song, he started to cry. He wasn't gonna say any more. He didn't say any more. But he was touched, and every time I think of that, I am also. We left the camp. We got in the car and went to the city, to the hotel. He said, "They will have patience. "They will have weight, "and we'll build the country on them." (ship horn blares) - [Morgan] Despite the British gunships, despite the hardships and perils of the journey, the Jews continued to make their way illegally to Palestine. In August of 1946, the British begin deporting illegal immigrants who reach Palestine to detention camps on the island of Cyprus. - You had to smell Cyprus to believe it. To this day, I can still smell Cyprus. It was about 115 degrees, I think, but it felt like 200 degrees in the heat. And the people were living in tents and Quonset huts squeezed together. There was no running water in Cyprus. There was no privacy in Cyprus. You smelled the garbage all the time. You smelled the sweat of the people as they leaned over the pots and pans where they were cooking their food outdoors 'cause there were no kitchens indoors. I felt that these people either had complete despair or such hope and faith that nothing could stop them. There was both strength in some of them and a sense of the world doesn't care about us. We've suffered and we'll go on suffering. They looked at you with a kind of apathy, and at the same time thinking, and you knew that they were thinking, well, somebody from Earth has come down into hell to see what this purgatory looks like. And yet, despite that, 500 babies were born in one year. - Many women stopped menstruating, particularly in the camps. They were mortified that perhaps they would never be able to have children. So they very eagerly wanted to have a child, if only to prove to themselves that they are still viable human beings, but more importantly, recreating a family was an act of defiance against Hitler. (mid-tempo upbeat music) - [Morgan] Both in Cyprus and in Europe, the DP camps have the highest birthrate of all the Jewish communities in the world. By the end of 1946, a thousand Jewish babies are born each month in the camps. - One day, I didn't feel so good. I went to doctor, and they said I'm pregnant. I was so happy I'm pregnant. I ran to the office, and I say to the other woman, "I'm pregnant, I'm gong to have a baby!" And she says, "Oh, Livia, I'm so sorry to tell you." What you mean? Why aren't you happy for me? She says, "Exactly this morning, "I got a notice that you should come "for the visa to go to America." I said so what? I can go to America. No, the baby has to be a half a year old before they can let me go. Well, it spoiled a little the happiness, but I was never sorry that I was pregnant. Every mother loves their children, but to me, they replaced my parents, my brothers, my uncles, and cousins, and everybody. Parents can't be replaced, but at least I had something my own. So, um, we came to America in '47. (ship horn blares) - [Yael] Most survivors that went to Israel went because of their belief in Zionism and wanting to build a Jewish land. Most survivors who came to the United States came because they had relatives here, and they believed that they could recreate a family and a sense of family. So they came with that longing. (slow dramatic music) - [Man] Even on the boat crowded with Jewish refugees, we were already turned to the future. Nobody told stories of the past, but everyone had a story to tell. There was expectation of new things in the air. - [Man] I felt completely at home the first day. I had left nothing on the other side but misery and tragedy and horror. It was like emerging from the ashes like a phoenix with this exhilarating feeling of freedom. The tragedy was in me and would stay with me, but for the time being, this was my rebirth. I felt like a hunchback with the hump somehow removed, who can straighten out and walk like a man. - [Morgan] Even in America, though, even among Jews, the survivors meet with a mixed reception. - [Man] From the way people looked at us, as if to say, how come my brother didn't survive, and you did? I felt as if I had to apologize for surviving. So I put a bandage on my number so I wouldn't have to talk about it. - When I came here, I want to tell why brother the whole story because he didn't know anything, how our parents got killed, and what I know, but they didn't wanna listen. He said, forget it, why should you? They were sorry that I should be upset, but to me, it would have been good if I talk about it. But they didn't wanna listen, forget it. We can't forget it. But don't talk about it and don't, okay, so I learned not to talk. - We really didn't understand what the survivors were telling us. The stories sounded too horrible. We simply did not believe them. They needed help, and we had no idea what they were talking about. They would say you live in America now. The past is the past. Let bygones be bygones. The reactions they received here were sometimes so insensitive that it's shameful to repeat. Like a survivor would tell about Auschwitz and people would say, well, we had it hard here, too. We had to stand in line for cigars. Or did you really never get a dessert? Or without toilet paper? How could you live without toilet paper? Or what did you do to survive? There was an assumption that if you survived, you must have committed immoral acts. So their reception was extremely different and not respectful. (slow somber music) - [Man] After a while, I didn't want to speak about the Holocaust at all, so I just decided to give up, to forget everything and avoid anything that had any connection to the past. - [Morgan] For many of the survivors, this retreat into silence lasts for years. (explosion booms) (mid-tempo dramatic music) - [Newsreel Announcer] 16 persons die and 13 others are injured as extremists blow up the officers club at Haifa in an unremitting campaign of violence. - [Morgan] By early 1947, the British have reached a breaking point in Palestine. Almost no night passes without a sabotage attack against their military installations. In January 1947, the wives and children of British servicemen are evacuated to Britain. Harassed by unrest and revolt in India, Egypt, and other parts of the Commonwealth, the British begin thinking of cutting their losses in Palestine. In January, during one of the worst winters of the century, Rabbis Friedman and Bernstein visit Ernest Bevin in London. - He's sitting there behind his desk alL wrapped up in a fur coat, scarf around his neck, a hat on his head, and a little tiny electric heater by his feet. I mean this was the foreign minister of the Empire of Great Britain. And he was in a lousy mood. Now I can't really repeat the conversation because it was one of the most profane conversations. I mean it was just an incessant barrage. You Jews are the cause of all the trouble in the world. No wonder everybody hates you. You are never satisfied. You are always wheedling up and asking for something. And finally, at the end, he made this terrible outburst, And I'm gonna get rid of the whole goddam f'ing problem, because why the hell should England have it on her back? I'm gonna throw it to the blank-blank United Nations. Let them struggle with it. - [Morgan] A month later, Bevin announces in Parliament that he is referring the Palestine question to the United Nations. The Jewish delegation meets in the New York hotel suite of Chaim Weizmann to assess their chances. - Surely, the Soviet Union would be against us, and that meant five states. Surely, most of the Latin American states would be against us because the Vatican had this theological, uh, quarrel, as it were, with the Jews. Surely, the Social Democratic countries, who are a majority in Europe, would be against us because they would go along with Mr. Bevin, who was flesh of their flesh and blood of their blood. And by the time we'd finished listening to Dr. Weizmann's litany, we went away in a rather chastened mood and thought it wasn't such a good idea from our point of view to have the United Nations deal with this question. - [Morgan] On April 28th, a special session of the General Assembly is convened at Lake Success, Long Island, to appoint yet another committee, the 19th, to explore the Palestine problem. Few expect the session to yield any positive results. - But something very dramatic happened. (speaking in foreign language) Up stands Ambassador Gromkyo, and says, first, that the Jews have very strong roots in the history of the land called Palestine. And second, the Western world was not able to save the Jews from the horrors of the slaughter in Europe. And third, therefore, there should be examined the possibility of a Jewish state. But, of course, what captured the imagination was the words, Jewish state, had emerged from Soviet lips before they'd been heard in any definitive way even from the United States or from anybody else. And at that point, I began to believe that we really might make it in the United Nations. (mid-tempo dramatic music) - [Newsreel Announcer] Jerusalem, bristling with British barbed wire, is in a state of armed truce. In the YMCA, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, under Sweden's Dr. Sandstrom, opens hearings. - [Morgan] In June, the Special Committee on Palestine, UNSCOP, travels to Palestine to begin its investigations. The committee includes representatives from 11 uninvolved countries which are assumed to be immune to the strategic interests of the major powers. - When I discuss our victories in the United Nations, I must give pride of place to our Arab adversaries because they made almost every mistake that could be made, and they were the mistakes of arrogance. They seemed to have believed that they had the strategic superiority, and when the United Nations made it possible for the Jewish Agency and for the Arab Higher Committee to appoint liaison officers, on the Arab side, they turned it down. They weren't even prepared to discuss the possibility of a Jewish state, even as a prospect. (slow stirring music) - [Morgan] Another event also critically affects the committee's deliberations. In July, the Exodus set sail from France for Palestine, packed with 4,500 illegal immigrants, more than any other previous ship. On July 18, six British destroyers intercept the boat off the coast of Haifa. The British open fire. Three people are killed and 100 wounded. - And then Exodus came into the harbor. In front of it was a cruiser called the Ajax and destroyers were following it. And suddenly, it docked right where I was standing, and there was a hole as big as the biggest open barn I had ever seen, and the ship itself looked like a matchbox that had been splintered by a nutcracker. And now, the British had them in the harbor and were forcing them off the ship. And they had refugee eyes, the eyes of the people who have been running, and they have been running, you know, since Hitler came to power, some of them. And those who were badly wounded, whose heads were already bandaged by the doctors among the refugees, the British took off the bandages, no matter how painful it was, and if they really were badly hurt, they were put on stretchers and taken to hospitals in Haifa. But if their wounds were not, what the British considered serious, they were forced onto these so-called hospital ships and everybody was told they're going to Cyprus. - [Morgan] Abba Eban persuades Emil Sandstrom, the Swedish chairman of the UNSCOP Committee, and the Yugoslav delegate to see for themselves what is happening in Haifa. - Justice Sandstrom said to me, "Whatever happens, the British Mandate can't go on. "If that's the only way it can be fulfilled, "then it better not be fulfilled at all." - [Morgan] Despite what the solders have told the captured immigrants, Bevin orders the refugees returned to France instead of Cyprus. (mid-tempo tense music) But when the boats reach France, the French refuse to accept any who will not disembark of their own free will. No refugee leaves the ship. - The British announced that they would take three correspondents aboard the ships, and they selected me to represent the American press. They took me down into the hold, and this so-called hospital ship was a prison cage. There were no beds. The people were lying half-naked, one head here, feet here, squeezed against each other. Each one of those prison ships had 1,500 people in that heat. They began to say to me, take pictures, take pictures of our children. And I was taking pictures, and I didn't know what I was shooting because I was blind. I was blind because the only light came from prison bars that were on one side of them. And, and I was blind with their agony. And a woman lifted a baby up and said, "Take a picture of my baby." And I took a picture. I said, "It's a beautiful baby." And she said, "Yes, I know, but," and she shook her head. And I said, "How old are you?" and she said 23, she looked at least 40. And I said, "Don't, don't worry, this'll end. "You're going to get there." I said everything stupid in the presence of some overwhelming tragedy. But she was much wiser than I, and she said, "No, my life is wrecked, "but I'm going to live. "I'm going to live so that my child will live." "I'm going to live so that no Jewish child "will ever be burned in a gas chamber again. "I'm going to live!" And then I realized that this whole odyssey, that this whole terrible journey, had been made for the children. - [Morgan] Eventually, the British send the refugees on to Germany and intern the passengers in several of the former Nazi concentration camps. While they languish behind barbed wire, UNSCOP issues its report. Seven of the 11 members of the committee recommend partition of Palestine into two separate states, one Arab and one Jewish, with the city of Jerusalem to be under international trusteeship. But passage of the UNSCOP recommendation is by no means certain. To win international legitimacy for statehood, a 2/3 majority of the UN's 57 member countries is necessary. Although President Truman supports the creation of a Jewish homeland, many in his administration do not share his views. - I had a very close friendship with James Forrestal, who was secretary of defense. We were talking one time. He said, "Why don't you fellows in the White House "get hold of yourselves." He said, "There are 30 million Arabs, "and about 600,000 Jews, "and ultimately, the Arabs will push the Jews "into the Mediterranean." - [Morgan] Doubts about the United States' position create uncertainty in Latin American countries, which represent 1/3 of the UN vote. Nations like the Philippines and Liberia, accustomed to following the American lead on international issues, also remain uncommitted. - When we reached the first voting opportunity, on the 26th of November, we just did not have the votes. Therefore, we had to gain time. One way of gaining time was to do what UN members usually don't object to doing, which was to make very long speeches. And I remember going up to a gentleman from a Latin country and saying, "Do you think that Your Excellency "could help us simply by making "a filibuster for an hour?" And he said, "For me, an hour's speech is not a filibuster. "It's just simply a few remarks." (speaking in foreign language) - [Morgan] As the speeches wear on, the president adjourns the General Assembly for the Thanksgiving holiday, giving the Jews more time to try to win the decisive votes. - The memory of the martyrdom, of the horrors of the Holocaust, although they hadn't really sunk in in any deep sense, hovered in the minds and the recollections and the emotions of so many of the delegates there. And that even at that early stage, before the Holocaust had been fully explored in all its scope, it did have the effect, there was a stirring of conscience. And some people wonder what conscience has got to do with diplomacy, but conscience did have something to do with diplomacy under the impact of these fearful events. - We will start it now. - Afghanistan. - [Man] No. - No. Argentina. (faint speaking) Argentina? Abstention. Australia. (faint speaking) Yes. - [Morgan] France is a critical vote. The prospect of French abstention threatens to disrupt the entire West European front. France. Yes. (members applaud) (gravel pounds) - [Morgan] The outcome depends on the votes of a handful of tiny nations whose decision is in doubt until almost the last moment. In the end, many are influenced by the actions of the US. - [Man] United States. - [Man] Yes. - [Man] Yes. (gavel pounds) - The resolution of the ad hoc committee of Palestine was adopted by 33 votes, 13 against, 10 abstentions. (council applauds) - [Morgan] With only three votes to spare, the United Nations authorizes the establishment of independent Arab and Jewish states in a partitioned Palestine. (upbeat lively music) (crowd cheers) - The vote on the 29th of November was greeted in Jerusalem by dancing in the streets, a general air of jubilation. It justified feeling that we'd made a stupendous breakthrough in the long saga of the Jewish people across the stage of history. - [Man] We were happy that night, and we danced, and our hearts went out to every nation whose UN representative had voted in favor of the resolution. We danced, but we knew that ahead of us lay the battlefield. - [Morgan] The Arabs consider the UN decision unjust and inequitable. They argue that humanitarian relief for the Jews does not require dividing Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. Why should they alone have to pay the price for Hitler's crimes? They refuse to recognize a proposed partition plan and begin a campaign of violence against the Jews. (gun fires) (mid-tempo tense music) - [Newsreel Announcer] Grim climax of tragedy in the Holy Land. Two truckloads of explosives blown up in the heart of Jerusalem's business section, killing almost 60 persons and wrecking some thousand buildings. The Arab High Command boasts of its responsibility for this act of frightfulness. - [Morgan] Although the UN plan calls for an independent Arab as well as Jewish state, the Arabs believe their military superiority can drive the Jews out of Palestine. Their attacks mount against Jewish settlements and civilians. The British government refuses to intervene. (slow riveting music) In Cyprus, in Germany, in Austria, the survivors continue to wait for the gates of Palestine to open. In the early months of 1948, the American government also turns against Jewish interest in Palestine. - Here was the position that the president of the United States was in. He believed in a certain policy regarding Israel. His State Department was opposed to him. His Defense Department was opposed to him. The rank and file of those in our diplomatic corp were opposed to him. The British, who had been the major power in that part of the world, were opposed to him. He had everybody against him. That did not affect him. He believed that they were entitled to a homeland, and he was going to do all in his power to see what could happen. - [Morgan] As the day for the final departure of the British nears, the State Department sends the American ambassador to Bevin in a last attempt to persuade him to prolong Britain's tenure. But Bevin has had enough of Palestine. (man shouts) (gun fires) As the dawn breaks on May 14, 1948, the last day of the British mandate, Jewish, Arab, and American intentions are still uncertain. Zionist leaders are not only divided about whether to proclaim their new state, they haven't agreed on a name for it. And if independence is proclaimed, will anyone recognize or acknowledge it? 50 hours before the still-unnamed nation is declared, President Truman meets with Secretary of State George Marshall in the Oval Office. The president has asked Clark Clifford to make the case for recognition. - If I may say so, I was really ready. I started at the beginning. And it was a very telling story. I gave a little history of the Jewish people, what they'd been through. I had two or three excellent quotes from the Old Testament, particularly from Deuteronomy, in which the Lord said to Moses, "This land shall belong to you and your people." I noticed Marshall's face getting redder and redder and redder, but I went right on as I'd planned. When I finished, Marshall could hardly contain himself. He said, "Mr. President," he didn't quite point his finger to him, but he almost did. He leaned forward and he said, "Mr. President, "let me tell you something. "If you were to select the policy "that Clifford has presented to you today, "I would be unable to vote for you "in the election this coming November." Total shock to everyone. (mid-tempo horn music) - [Morgan] On the afternoon of May 14th, while the last British high commissioner departs from Palestine, the executive cabinet of the Jewish Agency meets to make their final decision. By a vote of six to four, they decide to declare statehood. (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] By virtue of the natural and historic right of the the Jewish people and of the resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations, we hereby proclaim the establishment of the Jewish state in Palestine to be called Israel. (crowd applauds) (speaking in foreign language) (singing in foreign language) ("Hatikvah" by Samuel Cohen) - [Woman] When I heard the wonderful news announced on the radio, I became for a short while speechless. Then I burst into tears. Mentally, I was transported to another location, to the death camp Auschwitz. In the severe frost, a group of young barefoot girls proudly walked their last mile to the awaiting truck. As the truck started toward the gas chambers, they broke into loud singing of the Hatikvah. At that time, I said to myself that beyond any shadow of doubt, this singing, like a passionate prayer, had reached heaven, and that someday it would be answered. - [Morgan] At 6:00 p.m. Washington time, the State of Israel is announced. At 6:11, Truman responds to their request and the United States becomes the first country to recognize the new State of Israel. In the end, having argued his position, Marshall agrees to accept the President's decision rather than resign. - My own view is that Israel would not have survived without the support of the United States. (slow moving music) - [Morgan] The years of exile and wandering are finally over. At last, the Jews very a homeland where they can begin to build new lives. - [Man] From 1945, when the war ended, until 1948, when the state was established, I don't think there's another period of three years which has ever been so determinative because we came out of the death into the life. The Jewish people almost died, I mean totally and finally and irrevocably. - The period between the end of the war in '45 and the birth of Israel in '48, for many of us who were active in it, I think was the highlight of our lives. - My feeling about this period and the work I did was that a tremendous opportunity had been given to me to prove myself as a human being. - We came out on the the ashes of Holocaust to Eretz Israel, now the State of Israel, to build in an old new homeland our lives. This is our continuity, our eternity. - [Yael] The fact that the survivors chose again to live in this world, that they were willing to give it a chance, not only for themselves, but to create a new generation, to create a country for the Jewish people, a state, I think that's an absolute miracle. It's a true testament for their humanity, and I believe it's a true testament to the Jewish people. - [Man] As a private person, I believe I can overcome the Holocaust. A private person can learn to forget, to put that pain and suffering behind him. But as a collective, as members of the Jewish people, we can never forget. - [Man] If we were not an eternal people before, we are an eternal people after the Holocaust. We have not only survived, but we have revived ourselves. In a very real way, we have won, but in a very real way, we have lost. Who knows what beauty and grandeur six million could have contributed to the world? We lost. The world lost. And yet, we won. We're going on.
