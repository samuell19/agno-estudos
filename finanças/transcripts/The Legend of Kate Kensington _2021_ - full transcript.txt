- Go ahead, Honolulu. - Several planes have been shot down and anti-aircraft gunnery is very heavy. All lines of communication seem to be down between the various army posts. Everyone here on the islands were taken by surprise by the attack. And even yet, it's difficult for some people do believe that an air raid on these beautiful islands has actually had and that lives have been lost. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, several squadrons of Japanese planes came in from the south, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs over the city. One bomb dropped in front of the governor's mansion. Traffic is almost at a standstill. At Pearl Harbor, three ships were attacked, the Oklahoma was set a fire. There is great activity there now on clearing the debris. The governor has proclaimed the state's emergency. - Kate? - The army has issued orders for all people. - Are you okay? - The civilian population to remain off the streets. - Kate, I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Please say yes. - Yes. - You've made me the happiest man in the world. - Oh. - Whoa. - Captain, we searched this whole area. There's nothing out here. - Ayers, I need you and the other deputies to continue up this trail. - Yes, sir. - Did Collins and his men report back with their findings yet? - They took the bloodhounds deep in the woods surrounding Lake Denton. - All right. Send word when they return. I need you to remain diligent in your search. Okay? The Kensington's are an outstanding family in this community and we owe it to them to do all we can to bring Kate home safe. - 10 months. I'll be home in 10 months and then we'll spend the rest of our lives together. - I don't want you to leave. - I'd love to stay here with you, but we both know I've gotta go. - I love you, Kate. I will be back home to spend the rest of my life with you and nothing's gonna interfere with that, I promise you. I'll write daily. - You better. - I will. I love you, Kate. I love you with all my heart. - We interrupt this broadcast to bring this important bulletin from the United Press. Flash, Washington, the White House announces Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. - We all love and miss William too. You need to be a strong, Kate. I need you. She needs you too. I love you, Kate. - I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. December 7th, 1941, a date which you live in infamy. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. - I'm so lost without you. He will never leave me nor forsake me. - Dr. Kensington! It's Kate, she ran off into the wooded trails. - Now the number one rule we've got to uphold is to remain diligent in our search. This has been a tough case for all of us to endure. We are confident in our aggressive search of the area surrounding where Kate disappeared, that she is no longer there. This case will remain open and our thoughts and prayers go out to the Kensington family. - Did they find her? Did they find Kate? - Mom? Mom? Who's that lady? - Captain, with all due respect, do you believe they really saw her? It's been 10 months. How could she have survived these elements? - She's gotta be out here somewhere. Maybe with God's help and a little bit of luck, we can find her. - Daddy, what're we gonna do? Where is she? - Good morning. It's Katie Connors, Fayetteville's morning news here at K-M-A-C Radio. The search for a missing nine year old Fayetteville girl, Ellie Frederick, continues this morning. Ellie was last seen four days ago, riding her bicycle in the neighborhood of Erin Lakes. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Ellie. - Honey, are you gonna tell Mommy what's wrong? I can't help you if you don't talk to me. I know that something's the matter, I hear you every night. Will you please let me in? Mrs. McEntire called today and she said that you're falling behind in your school work and that you seem disinterested. And she asked me if there's anything going on at home. - I don't know, Mom. I can't make sense of it myself and I just find all this so confusing. - Well, I need you to try. - Well, I keep seeing that girl, that missing girl, Ellie Frederick. - She's been all over the news, that's all people talk about. Is that what's bothering you? - You don't understand, Mom. At night, when I go to bed, I see these things and I'm beginning to learn more. - But honey, those are nightmares. And I know that they seem really real, but when you wake up, you realize they're not real at all. Just bad dreams. - It's not what you think, Mom. I... I can feel her pain. It's just hard to explain. But I know it's real. Hey, Mom, I'm full. Can I please be excused? I have to work on my homework. - Sure. - Hey, Dad. No, I didn't know that she called you. She seems okay. She went to bed around 45 minutes ago, I would say. Yeah, you can come over tomorrow. Is everything okay? - No. No. Run. Please, run. Run. Run. Ellie. Please run. Run. Run. Run! - Hayley! It's just a dream again. It's just another bad dream, honey. - It's not okay, Mom. It's not okay. I saw her again. It's always the same. It's not a dream. It's just too real for it to be a dream. - Oh, honey. Oh, it's okay. - Dad! - Hey. - Hey. - How's my favorite daughter? - Pretty good. How's my favorite father? You wanna come in and have some coffee? - Sounds good. - Okay. Here you go, Dad. - Thank you. - So what's going on? - Diane, I really need to talk to you about something. - Well, is Mom okay? - Mom's fine. But your mother and I are worried about Hayley. - I am too, Dad, I don't know how to help her. - Your mother and I have never told this to anyone and we've not told it to you because we didn't want to alarm you. Losing Dan was tough on everybody. But now that Hayley is having this trouble, I feel we need to tell you about this. So one afternoon, we were having lunch and Hayley, right out of the blue, said, "My daddy's leaving soon." And your mother and I said, kind of jokingly, "Where is he going?" "My daddy's going to Heaven." We were shocked at this and so we continue to ask her questions, not really knowing what she's gonna say next. She said, "My daddy's gonna be in an accident "with a big orange truck and die." We didn't know what to say, so we said nothing. Five months later, Dan was in an accident with a big orange truck. A few days after Dan had passed away, I was walking past Hayley's room and I heard her talking to someone and I went in and I said, "Hayley, who are you talking with?" She said, "I'm talking to Daddy." And she was kind of surprised to see that I hadn't seen him there. Diane, I think there's more to this. I've never really believed in anything like this. I think Hayley has a gift. She can see things that we can't. And the only way we can help her is to listen to what she's asking you to do. - I'm gonna take her to the police station and they're gonna think that she's crazy. I'm afraid for Hayley. - I know you're scared, Diane, but you've gotta be brave for Hayley. She's trying to help. They won't think she's crazy if she can help them. She's got to do this. - Hey baby, what are you doing? - Nothing. Just thinking. - Do you like your new hot cocoa? - Yes, it's good. - I called today to the police station and I talked to a Detective Brooks. He's the one that's handling the Ellie Frederick case. And I made an appointment for us to go down there tomorrow and talk to him. Are you okay with that? - Yes. It's not going to be easy but I feel like it's something that we have to do. - Yeah, and we'll do it together. - Okay. - We'll do it together. - I love you. - I love you too, Mom. - So, we were told that you have information on the Ellie Frederick case. - Well, I don't know how much help we're gonna be but my daughter's been having these really horrible nightmares. That's the best way that I can describe it, and they're about Ellie and she's just insisted that she come here today to talk to you guys and tell you about them. - Hayley? It's okay, honey. You are not in any trouble. We're just here to try to help you, okay? Would you like to tell us about your nightmares? - Yes. I need to tell you. - I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions, okay? Okay. Do know Ellie Frederick? - No. - So before, have you seen her before her disappearance? - No. - Okay, Hayley, would you like to tell us about your nightmares? - It's okay, honey. I'm right here. I love you. - There was a man. He was sitting in a red truck, watching. The sound of a bell draws his attention. There was a young girl riding her bicycle as she passes the man watching her in the truck. Her blonde hair is in pigtails and she is wearing a purple shirt. He starts the engine, the headlights turn on. He begins to follow her. He has an out-of-state license plate. It's a... it's a Georgia tag and it reads, "G- "Four, "Two, "six, I-B." Yes, that's it, "G-4-2-6-I-B." She has fallen from her bicycle on a dirt road. She runs as fast as she can but it's getting dark. The man in the truck is getting closer. She runs to the park, the one with the large hill. She tries to hide. Ellie. It's not safe here. You have to run. - I can't run. I hurt my leg when I fell. - She's here. - Someone... or something is here, watching us. There is a darkness surrounding him. - She is here. - No. I can see through him. We have to go, now, Ellie! Ellie, please run! Run! - Ellie. - Ellie, it's not safe. We have to run. But I'm scared. - Ellie. - And all I wanna do is go home. - Well, come on, Ellie, let's go, - He has come, he's here. It's her. - Ellie! Where are you going? - I think he is gone. - Ellie, he's here. - I don't see anybody. - He's here. He's coming. - She wouldn't run. - It's okay. I'm here. - What do you think? - I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. I mean, the only way she would've known is if she was there. - I know we didn't leak any of this to the public. Should we all Adams? - Sarge? Yeah, we're gonna need you down here. You're not gonna believe this. - It's a tragic ending to the missing 10 year old girl, Ellie Frederick. As police and rescue units have located and removed her body from the isolated banks of the Aurora Sands Park last night. The Fayetteville Police Department is not revealed any information but they have confirmed that they do have a suspect in custody related to Ellie's disappearance. - Your grandmother and I are really gonna miss you and your mother. - I know, Grandpa, I'm gonna miss you and Grandma too. Try not to be upset with Mom. She says she's doing this for me, but in reality, I know this is what she desperately needs. - I know you're right but I just hate losing my two girls. You promise me, if you ever need any help with anything, you'll give me a call? - I will, Grandpa, I promise. I can't believe this is it. Our new home. - Are you excited? Look, it says sold. - Yes! - This is what we needed, Hayley, a new start. Do you like our new home? - I love it! - Good, I'm glad you do. - Race you to the house. - Okay! - I got it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - That box was so heavy. - Hi there. Were your neighbors down the street. - Hello. - How are you? Nice to meet you. - Hi. I thought I heard Hayley talking to someone. - Yeah, actually, we just walked up. My name is Michelle Parsik. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. This is my daughter, Ashley. - Hi. - And my name's Carl. - Hi, Carl. - That's my son, Carl. We just live right down the street. - Oh, great. Well, I'm Diane and this is my daughter, Hayley. - Hi. - Can you guys come in? - Oh, we don't wanna bother. We know that you have plenty to unpack. - Well, we could definitely use the break. - That's true, and we could use the company. - Okay then. Carl, do you wanna help Hayley with the box? - Uh, sure. - Great. - I got this. - Thanks, Carl. - You're welcome. - It's really heavy. - Yeah. - Let's crack open that cake. - Yeah! You now we're talking. - He loves his cake. - Well, one thing's fore sure, you wanted a quiet town, this is the place to be. - Well, how long have you lived in Inverness? - It has been 10 years. Carl hadn't been born yet and my husband and I moved here from New Jersey. - What does your husband do? - We've been separated for three years. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Yeah. What about you? Is there a Mr. Jennings? - Well, there was and... my husband died in a really bad car accident about six years ago. - Oh my. Well, I'm very, very sorry. - Thanks. - Hi, honey. - Hey. - What's Carl up too? - Oh, he's just looking at all of Hayley's mystery novels. - Oh. - Hayley loves to read those mysteries. - Carl's the same way, he's always got a book in his hand. - Yeah, he wants to be like my mom when he goes up. A news reporter. - You're a reporter, is that what you do? - Yes, I work for the Inverness News Five and we do the local news for Citrus County. - That is so exciting. - Yeah, it can be. It's usually the run-of-the-mill stories. - Well, it's a lot more exciting than what I do. I've just been a bookkeeper in North Carolina. - Well, at least you have normal hours. My mom, here, works inane hours. - Oh, Ashley, honey. - Well, you know it's true, Mom. - Well, you know, I've gotta capture the story. I've gotta be at the right time, right place, to get the news. - I know. - That's true. - Yeah, and I get stuck with crazy Carl all day long. - Carl's not that bad. - Oh, come on, he's your typical 10 year old boy and he's always doing things he knows he'll get him in trouble. - Well, you know, I can help out, if you guys ever need it, and it seems like they get along great. - You know what, I think we might have to take you up on that. - Yeah, I know. Get him out of the house. - Yeah. - So, good. - Yeah. - No signs of her out here. - Okay. I'll continue up Tompkins and then head to the Hills of Rest Cemetery. - All right, I'll continue my search of the ground in the historic district. Careful out there, this Morris girl is considered extremely dangerous. - Okay, you too. What are you doing out here this late at night? - Just going for a little walk. - You know there's a strict curfew in the cemetery at this hour, right? - No, ma'am, I wasn't aware of that. I don't want any trouble, ma'am. - I'd suggest you start taking your walks down the historic district from now on, okay? All right, get out of your. - What are you doing? - Well, I have to take a leak. I'll be right back. - Come on, Mark! Let's get out of here! - Hold on a second, a little busy. - Hey. You jerk, you really scared me! - You should've seen the look on your face. - It's not funny. - It actually was. This is kinda fun. - Let's just get out of here, okay? - All right. Let's go. Are you even gonna tell me why you're mad at me? - I'm not mad, it's just you really scared me. I wasn't expecting you to do that. - Well, I'm sorry I scared you. I'm sorry that I enjoy making fun of you at times. - It's fine, I'm not mad. Can we just, can we get outta here please? - All right. Evening, officer. - What are your kids doing out here so late at night? - Just heading home, passing through the graveyard. - Aren't you John Henning's daughter? - Yes, ma'am. - Do you know you're out this late? - We were just headed home. - Let me see your driver's license and registration. - Yes, ma'am. - Y'all go on and get out of here. - Yes, ma'am. - Help me. ♪ In a world so ♪ ♪ Cold ♪ - Inverness, keep your radio dial on... ♪ 98.3 ♪ - Coming up, "The Morning Call." - Good morning to all you local ghosting and ghouls out there. It's time to rise up and face another terrifying work day. You might wanna bundle up on your way out the door this morning, as the forecast calls for a low of 28, a high of 68 and only a 10% chance of afternoon showers. I get to the studio this morning, grab my cup of coffee and start preparing for the morning show. I take a look at this morning's newspaper and I cannot believe what I am seeing. I mean, have you seen "The Chronicle" this morning? "A ghostly apparition appears at a local cemetery." And with that headline is this amazing picture of what appears to be a ghostly apparition of Kate Kensington. - Hey, Rita. Good morning. - In local news, police are still looking for Jennifer Morris, who escaped last night from the Dunning Mental Institution around 6:40 PM. She is considered unstable and extremely dangerous. If you see Miss Morris, do not approach her. Please contact your local authorities immediately. Fitting for Halloween as this local legend continues to stir. A picture has surfaced by respected local photographer, Ralph White, which shows what appears to be an apparition of a woman walking along the Hills of Rest Cemetery grounds. Mr. White claims he took this photo... - I'm surrounded by the darkness. - Joining us now is our very own Channel Five news reporter, Michelle Parsik, who is live at Hills of Rest Cemetery. Michelle? - Thanks, Diane. With Halloween only a day away, this picture adds more mystery and controversy surrounding the local legend of Kate Kensington and the Kensington estate. It was on October 31st, 1942, when Dr. Robert Kensington reported his daughter, Kate, missing. At the time of Kate's disappearance, it was reported that she was suffering from a severe case of depression due to the loss of her fiance. It was documented that Kate spent nine months at Dunning Mental Asylum where she received treatment for her condition. Kate Kensington was released into her family's care on October 29th, 1942. A massive search was conducted for several weeks, with only a handful of dead end leads. - This has been a tough case for all of us to endure. We are confident in our aggressive search of the area surrounding where Kate disappeared, that she's no longer there. This case will remain open and our thoughts and prayers go after the Kensington family. - The mystery of Kate's disappearance has never been solved and for the last 72 years has remained open. Today, we're only left with questions. - Mom! I was watching that. - Hayley, it's late. We don't get a move on, you're gonna be late for school. - Fine. So, did you read the book, "From the Mist"? - No, I haven't gotten to that one yet. - Did you even start it? - No, did you? - I finished it last night. All 118 picture-less pages. You know the test is on Monday, right? - Yeah. I'll read it over the weekend. Anyways, I'm on the last chapter of "In the Shadows." - Is it any good? - It's very good. Had just the right amount of creepiness in it. - Hmm, I'll read that one when you're done with it. - So, did you see the story this morning that my mom was reporting on? You know, that Kate Kensington girl? - Yeah, I was watching some of it. - What do you think about all that? Do you think it's true? Kelsey Thomas was talking about in class yesterday. She said that her and her brothers camped out near the cemetery and that they get see the apparition of Kate Kensington watching them from the woods. - I wouldn't believe anything Kelsey Thomas has to say. She just likes to scare everyone. - It is interesting though. I mean, the whole lady of a ghost walking around. - Hey, Carl! Hayley! Why didn't you guys wait for me? - We did. You never showed up. - Well, I'm here now. - What's wrong, Lila? You seem upset. - I just spent the last 15 minutes picking up all my school papers after the Henderson boys threw them in the street. - Why would they do that? - Why do they do anything that they do? I saw your mom on the news this morning talking about the Kate Kensington mystery. - She has the working a lot of overtime. Ever since that picture of Kate's ghostly apparition made the headlines. - I can't believe someone actually caught a picture of her. That's proof that this whole thing is real. - Hey, we should go over there and check it out for ourselves. - Go where? - The Hills of Rest Cemetery. - Yeah, we could take a look around and see where that picture was taken. - We could start our own little investigation. - Yeah, we can become famous ghost investigators. Get our own TV show and everything. - I'm serious, Hayley. - Well, I have to go to the library today. Besides, what do we know about ghost hunting anyway? - We are taking your calls here at "The Morning Show." What's the buzz? Kate Kensington. This 75 year old mystery will not go away. In fact, it's hotter than ever because we now have possible proof with a picture taken by local photographer, Ralph White, at the Hills of Rest Cemetery. And you are on the air. Who am I speaking with? - This is Melissa. I totally understand that there is a fascination surrounding the disappearance of Kate Kensington, but it has now turned into this crazy local legend that we as a town can no longer escape from. - Case log 2-9-7-2. Kate Kensington. January 29th, 1942. A young woman was admitted today who is suffering from severe depression. Her fiance was killed during the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor. Tuesday, February 3rd, 1942. Our initial evaluation of Kate is complete. We will begin treating Kate with insulin injections to induce coma. We will continue this treatment for the next 90 days. Thursday, May 14th, 1942. The insulin treatments have proven to be unsuccessful. We are beginning to move into the next phase of our treatment for Kate. Monday, May 18th, 1942. We have now started treating Kate with electro shock therapy to induce seizures. Saturday, September 26th, 1942. Thus far, Kate has shown no signs of improvement. Her depression has continued to escalate and she is beginning to show signs of schizophrenia. I fear the worst. - I'm surrounded. - Thursday, October 29th, 1942. Since Kate's treatments have been unsuccessful, her father has decided to remove her from the facility and have her released into their care. In my closing report, Kate has become more mentally unstable. I'm afraid there's nothing more that we can do for her. - I can't find my way. - It's her. - The darkness is here. - I don't know where to begin. - Miss Jennings, I'm here to try to help you, not to judge. Everyone has problems. Sometimes they just need to talk to someone to help them work through it. Why don't you start by telling me a little bit about your daughter? - We are confident in our aggressive search of the area surrounding where Kate disappeared, that she's no longer there. This case will remain open and our thoughts and prayers go out to the Kensington family. - You see, my daughter isn't like the other children. She's special. - Help me. - Well, she can see things that other people can't. - You mean like clairvoyant? - Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Do you remember the Ellie Frederick case? - Yeah, the young girl that went missing in North Carolina. - Yeah, that's the one. Well, after she was abducted, my daughter, Hayley, kept having these really bad nightmares. - There are over 50 or so sightings of Kate Kensington that have been reported and documented over the years. - Wow, really? - And that's just scratching the surface. - What about you? Any luck? - And how are things going now? - Well, we love our new home and Hayley's made a lot of new friends in school. And she loves her school. However, I can see it happening again. She won't admit it but I know it's true. - Kate? It couldn't be. Oh my Lord! Kate! It is you! - We should get going, Emily. We have chores to do before dinner. - Yes, Mommy. Bye, daddy. - Good day to you, Mrs. Marsin. - Oh, hello June. - Hello, Emily. - Hello, Mrs. Allen. - We missed you in church today. - Yes, I know, we've had our hands full with chores this week. We will attend next week's service. - Well, you know if there's anything that we can do for you, we're here to help. - Well, thank you June, I'll keep it in mind. - And we'll see you in church next week? - Yes, of course. - Have a great day. - Good day. - We're back, Mom, just as I said, we would be. The days have been so hard since you've been gone. We did manage to get the barn done. But you were no longer here. - Mom? Mom, Mom? Who's that lady? - Kate? It couldn't be. Could it? Jeremy, come stay with your brother. I'm gonna go see if it's Kate. Kate! Kate, stop, it's me. It's Mrs. Allen. Kate! Oh my Lord. Kate! It is you! Kate! Kate! Kate! It's okay. Nobody's gonna hurt you. - Mrs. Allen, please calm down. I know you're excited, but please, I need you to calm down. Now what makes you think it was Kate Kensington? - Captain Harper, you should surely know that we are very close friends of the Kensington's. Why, Kate and Carol used to come to our house all the time for dinner. So when I tell you that saw Kate, you better listen! 'Cause she's out there. I saw her out in those woods. - It was her, Captain Harper! I saw her with my own eyes! - Boys, come on, we're going home. Good day, Mr. Harper. Frank. - Ma'am. - Good day, Mrs. Allen. - Were you able to notify DiMatteo and Ayers? - Yes, sir. They're heading down to the Eastern bank of Lake Denton. - Okay, good. - You know, I did a quick search where Mrs. Allen had claimed to see Kate. Nothing was there, sir. A lot of the brush and tree branches were intact but I did see a set of footprints leading into the trail. - Just doesn't make sense. I believe that the Allen's saw someone, someone had to go on that trail. We just have to continue the search. - All right. - Let's start with the facts. What do we know? We know that the Kensington's were among the first sellers here in 1891. We also know that they had two children, Robert and Elizabeth. Robert would then leave Citrus County to study medicine, only to return in 1918. He would then marry his wife, Frida, in 1919. Here's where it gets really interesting. Robert and Frida Kensington had two daughters. Kate was born in 1920 and Carol, who was born in 1922. - So Kate was born in 1920. So Kate was 22 years old when she disappeared. - Yes. - What else were you able to find out about Kate? - That's just it, nothing. The history book mentions Carol, Kate's sister, married Henry K. Tompkins in 1941. He had four children, Owen, David, Ethel and Benjamin. - Well, I was able to find when Kate was admitted to Dunning Mental Asylum and that was on... January 29th, 1942. She was placed there because she was suffering from a severe case of depression due to the loss of her fiance. - So Kate was in Dunning for a total of nine months. - Yeah. - Then two days later, she went missing. What I find interesting is the last person to see Kate alive is the housekeeper. She mentions that she sees Kate walking into the woods behind the home, wearing her wedding dress, but never tries to stop her or even notify the family right away. - Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. - There was a massive 22 day search around the surrounding area of where Kate disappeared and they never even turned up a single clue to her whereabouts. - So she is walking into the woods and is never seen again. - Well, not never. I guess the big question is, why is Kate still here? - So this is the trail that will take us to the Kensington Estate. - Yeah, it leads right up to the back of the estate. Used to come out here all the time as a kid. I haven't been out here in forever though. - What is it? - Thought I saw something down the trail. - Oh, come on, Dan. Are you serious? Hello? Kate, is that you? We need to interview you. We have a story to run. Well, I guess she's camera shy. If you didn't wanna walk up the trail, you should have told me. These shoes are killing me anyway. Come on, Dan, let's wrap it up. - So when did this happen? - It was in... 1976. - Are they still buried in Hills of Rest Cemetery? - I don't know. - So even in death, they couldn't rest in peace. - I think they are now. - So that was just Kate's parents, right? - No, they were vandalizing Kate's fiance's grave too. They had to move all of them. Now, it says here that Carol, Kate's sister, died in 1984, but it doesn't mention her resting place. - Think about what that poor family had to go through. All these years with this unwanted attention. - I've passed by this place many times before. This is the first time I've ever stopped to take a really good look at it. - It's amazing. - Sir, my tour of duty will be ending near the end of December and I plan on coming home to stay. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Your daughter and I are in love. We've been in love for quite some time now. I would like to ask for your blessing in her hand in marriage. - William, I've always respected you. You're a good man and I couldn't ask for a better man to have us a son-in-law. - This is so great! Oh, I'm so happy for you. - I love you, Kate. And I'm very happy for you and the bright future that awaits you. It's all there for you, honey. - Thank you, Daddy. - The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy. - You need to talk to someone, Kate. We love you. We want to help you. We just don't know what to do anymore. Daddy's talking about sending you away for professional help but I don't think that's a good idea. You need to be here, surrounded by the people who love you. Kate, look at me! Please, just look at me. Do you understand what's happening? They're gonna send you away for medical treatment. - We were to become a family. It's a girl. - Daddy, she's not getting any better in here. We have to take her home. - No more tests! No more treatments! She is going home! - I've never seen Daddy so excited than this morning when he went to go pick up Kate. - You've been through a lot, Carol. You and your sister have been through a lot this past year. - We've all been through a lot. I just hope that now she's coming home and that everything will be much better. - Carol, Kate's here. - Kate! - So who owns this place now? - Well, Carol owned it for many years until she passed away. Then it was willed to her son, David Tompkins. - Now, you know the rules. We have to stick our pinky finger out when we drink our tea. - Good morning, Ellen. - Oh, hello, Miss Dampier. We are just having our morning tea. - Well, how wonderful. Is your mommy out here too? - She's in the gazebo having tea with Miss DeMuro. - Well, I better pay them a visit. You have a wonderful tea time, Ellen. - Okay. - Do they still live here? - No, nobody lives here right now except for the caretaker. The last person to stay here was one of David's friends from college. She stayed for less than three weeks when she had claimed to see the ghostly apparition of Kate Kensington. - What happened to her? - She left and never return. - Mommy, Mommy! I just saw that lady again. - Ah, that's one of Ellen's imaginary friends. - She was looking at me through my bedroom window. - You can see me. She came back. There is only darkness. - We need to leave, now. Guys? Guys? We should really get going. - What's wrong, Hayley? - I'm just done with all of this. Can we just leave? - What's wrong with you? - I just don't wanna do this anymore. Fine, I'm leaving. - Hayley! It's okay, wait up. - Hello? Oh, hey Michelle. Oh yeah, sure, that's not a problem. Yeah, he can just have dinner with us. - It's incredible how many sittings there have been of Kate over the years. On October 28th, 1984, The mayor's own daughter even been documented as seeing Kate Kensington. The mystery only deepens... - I think you need to let it go. - I thought we were gonna do this together. I thought we were a team. - Carl, this is becoming all too real for me. There are things that you just don't understand. - What is it, Hayley? Where are you not telling me? - Okay. Hey Carl, it's your mom. - Oh, okay. Hey, Mom. - Hey, Hayley. - Mm-hmm? Yeah. - Dessert's almost ready. - I don't think so, Mom. I'm still full from dinner. - But it's your favorite. Homemade apple pie and ice cream. Oh, someone's at the door, be right back. - Yeah, she's already here. Love you too, Mom, bye. - Did he have dinner? - Yeah. Oh, that's great, now I don't have to make dinner for a him and I can study some more. - What are you studying? - History, I have a history exam. - Are you gonna go with us tonight to investigate? - I don't think so, Carl. - Wow. - Carl, it's not safe. Promise me you won't go there tonight. I'll tell you everything. Just don't go. Call me when you get home. - Fine. - You guys need anything, don't hesitate to call. - No, we'll be fine, thanks, Miss Jennings. - You're welcome. - Miss Jennings, thanks for dinner. - You're welcome, Carl. - Come on. - Anytime. - Mom's working late again. - Don't you just hate it when she works late? - Yeah. Come on, hurry up. Your backpack. - Carl! So what time are we going later? - Where do you think you're going? - Just to the park. - I don't think so. - Come on, Ashley, what's the big deal? It's just a park down the street. - The big deal is that Mom said to bring you home and that's it. - Fine. Can Lila at least come over? - Fine, as long as you two keep it down. I have an essay due tomorrow. - There was a massive 22 day search around the surrounding area of where Kate disappeared and they never even turned up a single clue to her whereabouts. - The darkness... is here. - So she just walked into the woods and is never seen again. - Well, not never. - So when I tell you that I saw Kate, you better listen! 'Cause she's out there. I saw her out in those woods. - Raymond, I need you to take the Northern trail. Steven, you take the southern one. I'll take the trail in between. - Captain, with all due respect, do you believe they really saw her? It's been 10 months. How could she have survived these elements? - Raymond, we've gotta follow every lead we get. I believe the Allens believe they saw Kate Kensington and that's good enough for me. Now the number one rule we've gotta uphold is to remain diligent in our search. She's gotta be out here somewhere. Maybe with God's help and a little bit of luck, we can find her. - I'm surrounded by darkness. - Well, I miss you too, Mom. I know it's a lot different than just living right down the street. I know it's gonna take some time to get adjusted to it, that's for sure. It's totally different down here. But it's really beautiful. I know, we don't have mountains, but we have the Gulf. How's Dad doing? I wish you guys could come down here. Well, at least in the spring. 'Cause this is not that hot then. Yeah, Hayley misses you guys. She talks about you all the time. Gosh. That's really weird. No, I mean my back door's open. I don't think anyone went out there. Hayley? I guess not. I'll lock it that time. Oh, very funny. - We interrupter this broadcast to bring this important bulletin from the United Press. Flash, Washington, the White House announces Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. - Go ahead, Honolulu. - Several planes have been shot down and anti-aircraft gunnery is very heavy. All lines of communication seem to be down between the various army posts. - And they report to us that the attacking planes number between between 50 and 100, that the air raid is still on and that the anti-aircraft fire can be heard in a steady drum as the attacking planes come in. - The army has issued orders for all people of the civilian population to remain off the streets. - He will never leave me nor forsake me. I'm surrounded by darkness. - I'll be home in 10 months and then we'll spend the rest of our lives together. - I don't want you to leave. - I'd love to stay here with you, but we both know I've gotta go. I love you, Kate. I will be back home to spend the rest of my life with you and nothing's gonna interfere with that, I promise you. - There were 350 men killed in a direct bomb hit on the barracks at Hickam Field. - We all love and miss William too. You need to be strong, Kate. I need you. She needs you too. I love you, Kate. - I can't fight the pain... in my heart. - I love you, Kate. I will be back home to spend the rest of my life with you and nothing's gonna interfere with that, I promise you. - I can't do this without you. We were to become a family. Can you help me? I'm surrounded by darkness. - It's her. It's her. - I still think flashlights would've been better suited for this investigation. - These old lanterns will do the job. Besides, I didn't want to alert Ashley of the flashlights in the closet. We have everything we need. A camera, voice recorder and lights. Hold up. Here. You take the pictures and I'll do the audio recordings. - Do you really think we're gonna see her? - We can only hope. - How much further up is this trail to the Kensington home? - This trail takes out at Hills of Rest Cemetery. We have to go on down the trail to get to the Kensington Estate. I'll say about a mile. - A mile? Had I known that, I might have stayed home too. - Stop complaining. - How do you know about this trail anyway? - I used to come out here with Ashley and her boyfriend, riding the ATV. What is it? - I think I see something moving up the trail. - Hey, Michelle. - Hey. - You about done? - Yeah. Bobby says we gotta get going if we wanna make the five o'clock deadline. - It's okay. - Don't you get tired of this stuff? - No. - Why does it always revolve around Halloween? - Because, Dan, it's like I said, it all revolves around the time of her disappearance. I agree with you, there are wackos out there that are trying to get attention based on this information. But there's something out there. There's one thing that's gonna draw this all together. I feel it. - William is gone now. You have to come with terms with this. - Fight this, Kate. Fight for your life! - I can feel your darkness. How can I help you? - Can you help me? - Daddy? Daddy, something's wrong with Kate. - The darkness... is here. - What was that? I think someone's at the door. - Do you think it's her? - I'm not sure. It's too hard to tell. Whoever it is... is moving further up the trail. Here, take a look for yourself. - I don't see anything. - Come on, Lila, let's go! - Carl, wait! - Come on, we don't wanna lose her! - But Daddy, that's not fair! Kate has lost everything. - Carol, this will ruin my reputation with the community. She can't even function on her own anymore. - Dr. Kensington! It's Kate! She ran off into the wooded trails! - You have to let William go. We love you, Kate. Come back to us. - We can't keep this a secret any longer. You and Henry have to take the baby. - Then I shall keep the name that Kate was gonna give her. Ellen. Ellen Tompkins. - Mommy, Mommy! I just saw that lady again. - Oh, that's one of Ellen's imaginary friends. - She was looking at me through my bedroom window. - I have been trapped within my own pain. Only the darkness remains. - Does anyone know the truth? - Well, out of respect from our father, Henry and I are gonna raise Ellen as our own. No one can really know the truth. - I am so sorry. - I just wish Kate could see how beautiful she is today. - She's coming. - Do you think we lost her? - I don't know. I think we should keep going. - Carl, she's coming! - Go, go, go! - Hayley, wake up. Hayley. What? What is it? - Oh my gosh. That's it. I know why she's still here. What time is it? I have to call Carl and Lila. - Who's here? Hayley. - Can you see her? - Yeah. I'm just not sure if it's her. - What do you mean? Who else would be out here wearing a white wedding dress? - I don't think she is wearing a white wedding dress. - She's coming. - Mom. Something is telling me Carl and Lila are in great danger. - Hello? - Ashley, this is Mrs. Jennings. - Oh, hi, Mrs. Jennings. - I need you to listen to me. Is Carl there? - Yeah, he's in his room with Lila. - Can you please go check for me? - Is everything all right? - Well, I'm not sure, but can you please go check on him? - Hold on. Miss Jennings, they're not here. - Okay. Okay, I'm gonna need you to listen to me, okay, Ashley? Okay, I need you to call your mother and I need you to call Lila's parents and you just tell them that the kids are not there and then I need you to stay at home in case the kids come back, okay? Do you understand me? - Yes, I'll call her now. They mentioned something about going to the park. - Well, no, they're not at the park. - Here, take a look for yourself. - Yeah, you're right. She isn't wearing a white wedding dress. Lila, grab the camera and take a picture. We need to document this. Wait a second. My gosh, she has a knife in her hand. Lila, take the picture. - She's coming. - Let's get outta here! - No, they are both 10 years old! Hayley. - I have code three, where they're reporting two signal eight at 4940... - Hayley. - West Tompkins Street. We have confirmed multiple reports on two signal eight. Possible locations, 248 West Main Street... - Hayley. Hayley! - At Kensington Estate. - Hayley! Where are you? - Ma'am? - Hayley? - Is everything all right? - No, because now my daughter is missing and she probably went to go look for her friends. - We are sending a unit out... - I have to go! - I think Hayley has a gift. She can see things that we can't. - It's not a dream. It's just too real to be a dream. I am beginning to see more, learn more. I can feel their pain. This is all so confusing to me. I just, I can't make sense of it anymore. - God, please help me. I'm so confused by the things I see. I feel so helpless with what I can't do. Why is this happening to me? I'm so sorry I couldn't save Ellie. Please, don't take my friends from me. I can't go through this again. - "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, "'the truth "'and the life.'" - The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leaves me beside still waters and restores my soul. He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me. - Do you think we lost her? - I don't know. I think we should keep going. - Carl, she's coming! - Go, go, go! - Hayley. Hayley! - Mom! - Why would you just run away from me like that? It's me, why would you do that? - I needed to stop Carl and Lila. Something pulled me here. I can't explain it... but I know the truth now, Mom. - The truth? What do you mean? - The priest helped me see the truth. - The priest? There's nobody here. There's nobody here, honey. Can't you just be like everybody else? Just pull it back and just be a little bit normal. - As you go through this life, Hayley, you really need to remember the most important things. A lot of people lose sight of them and then they, they lose their journey, they lose their way. In the scriptures, it says that there are two most important things to remember. To love the Lord, your God, with all of your heart, all of your mind, all of your will... and all of your soul. And the next most important thing is to remember to love your brothers and sisters as you love yourself. You have been given a great gift, Hayley. Do not run from the problems that may come because you will find the answers by facing them with boldness. Do not run, do not question, trust the Lord, for He sent the Holy Spirit to be your comforter, your guide, your teacher. Let the light pave your way. Let it pave your way, be a lamp unto your feet and light unto your path, for you will conquer. Do not be afraid to walk in darkness and do not be afraid of what walks in the darkness, for you will never ever be alone. Think about it, the Creator of the universe, the Lord, your God, will always, always be with you. So use this gift to share with those who do not have the revelation, who do not have the understanding that you have given. For God is using you to show them things that they cannot see with the natural eye, to walk in the spirit. So use that gift wisely and you will be blessed and they will be blessed. - What? You mean be normal? Live a normal life? Worry about normal things? I can't. I didn't want this but it is what I am. I tried to block it out, no matter how hard I try, it always finds me. This is who I am. I'm still your little girl but there are things that I have to do. I can help them, Mom. They need me. People will always doubt what they don't understand. I truly believe God sent me here to help those who are lost in this world. I can do this, Mom. You can let go. And when I walk out this door, I am never alone. - May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord let His face shine upon you and be gracious unto you. May the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace. - Diane, I think there's more to this. I've never really believed in anything like this. I think Hayley has a gift. She can see things that we can't. The only way we can help her is to listen to what she's asking you to do. - There was nothing more that we can do, Hayley. We called the police and told them that they could be here or at the Kensington Estate. - Are you the one that reported the two missing children? - I don't think I can keep going. - Come on, Lila, we're almost there. You can do it. In here, Lila, in here. Stay here. I have an idea. She's coming. As soon as she passed us, we'll run back the other way. - I think we should go further into the woods. - The trail's the only direct way out here. Besides, we don't wanna lose sight of where this psycho is. If we run back in the other direction, at least we know we're heading away from her. - We're taking a risk just sitting here. - It's possible they're on one of these trails. - We're aware of that possibility, ma'am. They're preparing to send officers on the trails with ATVs. - How much further is this trail? - Not much further. - Good. I'm getting a bad cramp on my side. - Just a little more. And throughout this trail, we're gonna have to cut through the cemetery. Then we can go to Shane's house and call the police. - Yeah. At least we lost her. - And we know that she's heading in the opposite direction. You know that nobody's gonna believe this story. - Which part? That we got chased all over the trails by a psycho lunatic or that we actually saw the apparition of Kate Kensington? - Both. We have no proof. One of those stories right out of the Kelsey Thomas handbook. - It doesn't matter. I'm not sure... Go, run! Go, go, go! - Mrs. Jennings, I understand your concern. We cannot go in there. They're preparing to send officers in there right now. We need a secure. Hold it right there! Drop the knife, now! - Drop the knife! - Drop the knife. No one has to get hurt. Just drop the weapon. - Now back away. Let's go. Gonna put her in your car? - Okay. - I'm surrounded by darkness. - She's here. - Let the light pave your way. Let it pave your way, be a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path, for you will conquer. - Think about it, the creator of the universe, the Lord, your God, will always, always be with you. Do not run, do not question. Trust the Lord. For He sent the Holy Spirit to be your comforter, your guide, your teacher. So use this gift to share with those who do not have the revelation, who do not have the understanding that you have been given. For God is using you to show them things that they cannot see with the natural eye. - The Lord, my God will always be with me. - Hayley, no. - It's okay, Mom, I know what I have to do. I offer you my light. For so long you have suffered the pain of no one knowing the truth. With a secret so buried that your own daughter doesn't even know. I know, Kate, and I will share it with everyone. Your past will no longer remain a mystery. I will bring light to your darkness. You've waited so long to have peace. It's time for you to rejoin your family. They are waiting for you on the other side. All you have to do is embrace the warmth of that light and you will find the peace that you deserve. - I love you, Kate. I love you with all my heart. - You have found your peace, Kate. It's time for you to go home. Hayley! I'm so sorry, Hayley, I love you. I love you so much. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I tried to make you into someone you're not. I'll always believe in you. You're a gift.
