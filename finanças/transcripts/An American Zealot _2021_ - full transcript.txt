All right, everyone close your eyes. Let's say you're in the middle of nowhere, but you're not in the middle of nowhere, right by you is a huge bridge. And on the bridge are train tracks. Now there's a train coming. It's speeding out of control. And there are five people aboard the train. The bridge is out of service. If the train goes over the track, those five people face certain death, but you see a control switch. And if you switch it, you can divert the train down a different track. But on that track, there's a hiker who will not be able to get out of the way in time. So what do you do? Do you pull the switch and save the five people killing the hiker? Or do you do nothing and let the five people die? All right. What do you decide? You guys stumped? Good. I hope you are. Consider this to be your final. Three to five pages. Let's say someone caught this on video and it went viral. It goes viral. Your decision. You have to explain it on one of those morning talk shows to like Matt Lauer or something. What do you do? To explain your decision, what do you say? Hey, you still there? Yeah. Yep. Everything's fine. Yeah. Hey, could I maybe stay a little later tonight? No, it's nothing. No. So could I stay a little later tonight just like midnight or something? Yeah. His parents are here. Yes. Well, I just, I took Mavis and Mary Margaret. No, mom. Mom. No, it's fine. It's nothing. Let's try to post on YouTube with other dudes at prom. In front of you he told you to work on yourself? The one that Nicole just posted. Oh dude what's? That girl?

You need to slow down. You're good at issues at Oxford. Okay Luc? What about the baby? Rach So have you decided about where you're going to school yet? Lucy, What Maybe you got accepted into Princeton and Yale That's pretty impressive. I don't know Really? You know it's nothing to be nervous about. I mean, at the end of the day, it's just college, right? It's not that big of a deal. Yeah. Just four years of your life and $200,000 Yeah that's true. My mom doesn't have two homes like yours I'm good. I'm good. I've never seen you drunk like this before you good? Yeah All right. Bye. Want a wipe or something? Maybe you have some gum in the car. You know you shouldn't have been drinking. Shit, Rachel. Disgusting. I'm sorry. It's over. It doesn't matter What? I had an abortion. What? Of course you'd react like this. Like it's the end of the world. Yeah Rachel it kinda is. No keeping it would be take me home. I just heard that you went to that party last weekend. Yes, I did. Did you drink? No Oh. Okay I just, I'm just concerned. I mean, are you still thinking about going to one of those Ivy schools? Yeah. Why? I mean those places, they just breed such a culture of death. They're so secular. I heard they have black masses there. No, that was once at one of the schools. - Okay. - Okay. I just want to make sure you're making good decisions and doing what God wants you to do. Lucy Sorry about that. Didn't mean to startle you? No, I'm just flustered, graduation stuff. Yeah. So about that, I was thinking since a lot of us don't have any finals going on maybe I should throw another party this weekend. What do you think? No, I have some take home exams. Are you trying to sabotage my speech? Sabotage your speech what am I a CIA agent or something? No, I'm not trying to sabotage your speech. Like I'm sure that everyone else will go, but I'm really in check. Just think about it. Let me know. All right. Hey, put that away. Put it away. Hey guys, you guys have to be my tour. Let's go, Hello? Future Kevala students. I'm Chelsea Davis. Lucy, Chelsea. Hi, Carol is my pleasure. It's so nice to meet you. Moving on. So we have the chapel up here. Do we have anybody interested in English? One right here, Lucy. So you definitely like compete with Ivy League schools. I would say our professors Have they won like awards, been written up, you know, places we could read about. I mean, I'm sure that, that they have a always see a lot of things. National awards That was unacceptable, Lucy. It's not Harvard mom. I'm sorry that the Ivy League is out of our budget, but that's just the way it is. Provided you all pass your final exams, you graduate this week, Theophilus Class of 2015. Now we're talking about invitations. Many of you have big families and your ladies, thank you so much for joining us. Take your seats. Thank you. Where were you yesterday? You okay? Sorry. Hangover.

Now on the subject of valedictorian, as you know, the student with the highest GPA from the boys school and the girls' school are selected to write a speech. That speech will be judged by the faculty and the chosen students will give the Valedictory address and will also receive a full scholarship to the college or university of their choice. Our competitors this year, Mr. Hooper, and from the girl school, Lucy O'Brien. Well done, young lady. Let's have a nice round of applause on guys. Thy kingdom come thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Look at you two.

It's cool. Are you going to get through this? You know you had other options. It's not that simple, Lucy. And do I look like I'm ready to be a mom? That is a consequence of having sex. That is a risk that you took, you know your parents would have helped you And my mom, she had me when she was 19. And even she knows that if I had a baby right now, Wait was this her idea? No, it was my choice. I'm going to college or Europe. I don't know what I want from life. All I know is that I don't want to have a baby right now, maybe in 10 years. So you just did it like going to the dentist. My mom loves me that clinic. They understood. I understand Mr. Lauer, Thank you for having me here today to explain my actions in the video that so many Americans have now seen and scrutinized. What we have here, is a simple case of math. One life versus five. The choice is obvious for me. I think it should be for everyone else. Ooh hey Lucy, Saturday, you down? I have to work on Mr. Block's thing. Come on, everyone deserves a break. Yeah I'll talk to you closer to Saturday right? Heavenly father, thou hast given us the gift of freedom to love and to follow in thy ways and commands. Some parents choose to abuse this freedom by destroying the gift of life, which thou hast given to their offspring. Please forgive those who destroy human life by aborting their unborn babies. Hi, have you been here before? Okay. Fill this out, along with the nature of your visit and then you can have back over to me with your ID and we'll get everything started for you. You are 18, right?

Well, I'll let you know if I see her. Do you have a phone number? I can contact you. No, no. I'm probably just freaking out about it. She's probably up a tree in my yard, but thank you. Come on now. We've met before. Right? No, I don't think so. You've never been to the women's clinic in Venice? I'm an OB-GYN there. No. Maybe it was another red head. I'm pretty good at remembering redheads. Okay then. Well, it's nice meeting you, Lucy and good luck finding your cat. Nelly. Stop chasing the kitties. Are you an abortion doctor? Abortion is one of the procedures that I practice. Yes. So you don't have any problem killing innocent children? Oh no, no, no, honey. You have it wrong. Every procedure I do is an emotional one. A fetus is not a baby. They can't survive outside the womb. I have pamphlets that will explain all this. I'm going to go get you one. Okay. How do you live with yourself? I don't know how you live with yourself. I help people. Okay. I'll pray for you. Hey this is for you. Nobody has to know. Hey, no, you are the designated driver and I am a designated drinker. I need to grab my phone Hey Hey there. What I don't believe this. A proposition. Okay We shoot these and you teach me to shoot something else. What does that mean? You guys are always shooting at these things. I want to learn Really Anything you can do, I can do better. Right? All right, we'll see about that. Sorry. That took so long. I forgot the code. We all set up here. Yeah, I think so. It's not a crazy science or anything, is it? Let's add one to the mix. That'll be your target. Okay. So you've, you've never shot a gun before? No. Have you ever held a gun before? No All right, well here just grip it like this with your right arm don't don't pull the trigger. Is it loaded? Yeah. So don't point it at me. Let's walk back here. It's not that hard. Once you get past the initial, you know, the adrenaline rush of firing a gun you'll be good. Let's actually move up a bit since you're a first timer. Alright. You're right-handed right? Yeah. How did you know? We had class together. I'm very, very observing kinda guy. So you want to take your yeah, holding it in your right arm and then put your right leg back slightly and then lift it up and use your left arm to kind of stabilize it. Yeah. I'll help you out. All right. So your feet look good. Kind of angle, angle your shoulders back and you have to put it up like that. Put this on the bottom. How does that feel, does that feel right? All right. And then, Oh my God You all right? I didn't mean now Sorry. No, that's fine. I just slipped. That's fine. I guess I thought you'd be a little more timid than that. You want to try again? Come on. Nobody's scared. Here, It's easier. Hold again. Once you get the hang of it, I mean that wasn't bad for your first time. Alright, bottom. Now I'm going to go crazy hope you don't kill me. Watch out. Keep practicing, you'll be able to hit a target by the end of the night. That sounds like a challenge. Well maybe it is. It's in here. Ladies first. Thank you Ooh right, gotta put that back, the code is one one nine nine. Nope. Okay. Try one nine one nine. You know what, screw it. It's it's written down right here. There you go.

Put that on the bottom. Face it the other way. Yeah, there you go. I think that's how I found it and this goes on that. That's it. Is that a bathroom over there? Yeah yeah. Right out there. Be right back. Okay. Dude, you and Lucy? Don't worry about it Rach, Rachel, your turn Where's Lucy? Hey, no keys What You're not driving It's not like I was drinking Mavis said you were taking a shot with Ralph. Unlike you I know how to handle my liquor. Keys. Come on. Honey, wake up. We've got to go in 10 minutes to church. Come on, you know what we do? 10 minutes Luc hurry. Why don't you just go to Kid Walla for a year. You have a full ride and you can live at home. Mom, No Then go there, live on campus if you want, but you can't, I can't support you much financially. And your dad never comes through when he says he will. I have a really good feeling about valedictorian. Don't give up on your dream school, sweetie. But it's time for you to come down from the clouds and start living in reality. Hey Mrs. O'Brian. How you doing? Hey Ralph. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing Good. Do you mind if I borrow Lucy here for a minute? No, not at all. Cool. Thank you. Listen, you just get your brain moving in that direction. Let's see. So last night I saw you leaving and I felt weird about something. No Mavis had to go I had to Aren't we cool. Cause you know, I hope I didn't come off too strong. I mean, I know we were drinking, No, it was fine. We were drinking. I liked it. Nevermind, I just, I still want you to think anything that like, you know, I was, No, I would never. Okay, good. Anything else? Yeah. I don't mean to pry or anything with your mom, but I heard you guys talking over there and I just want you to know that whatever school you do end up going to, they're going to be lucky to have you. Yes, seriously. I hope you know that. Thanks. Darling, I was looking for you? I know you always take a walk after church. Graduation's coming out aren't getting excited? Yeah Can I give her a tree. Yeah, of course. There you go, Oh. Thank you, Mr. Lauer for having me here today. I'm glad to have this opportunity to explain the video so many Americans have seen and scrutinized I had to consider the numbers. To save the lives of the many in peril, I knew something had to be done. While unfortunate and truly sad a difficult decision had to be made and it had to be made with haste. Just wanted to say goodnight Luc. Night. I understand that life is a sensitive matter in order to save the five people aboard the train I had to take action and pull the switch. When one life endangers many, whether it be hundreds, thousands, or five, a sacrifice has to be made. By the switch puller a mark on their soul and by the man or woman who stands in the way, their life. Hi. Can I help you? Hi, did you happen to hear anything last night on the streets ma'am? No. Was everyone home? Yeah. Its just me and my daughter. Lucy, this nice police officer just came over. Miss, did you notice anything last night, hear any sounds? No. Does this have to do with any of those, I heard about these packages getting stolen off people's porches. Some of the neighbors were talking about that. No it isn't. But if you hear anything, just let us know. Please. Thanks. Thank you for coming. It's really strange. Honey, why are you doing laundry? It's like an episode of a television drama today. I was up at 248 this morning or throughout this, you know? And from the white, it looked over here, she was rolled out of her home and taken off to the hospital. Did she die? Well, I didn't see a body bag or anything, but cops are sniffing around. Tell you what though? If I didn't see or hear anything, nobody did. Did you ever meet her sweetie? No, never. Not that many people know it here on the street, but abortion doctor Really? Oh my God. She was just shocked to see me drink. Have you seen Ralph yet? No, but you know, you have to admit It's kind of weird, right? You all of a sudden you're taking shots. Like they're nothing. Yeah, sure. Alcoholic, that's me. We wouldn't go that far. I haven't seen his car yet. Did you see it? God, please don't tell me that you like him. No, I just have something of his, that's all. Don't worry. I'll make sure Mavis doesn't tell anybody. Good morning. I'm detective Brinkworth LAPD. Anything strange happened here in the last couple of days? No. That's all. Okay. Well look, here's my card. If you know anything, anything at all, will you please give me a call? Yeah. Sure. Anything at all? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Right before I let you go girls hand down your papers. How'd the paper go? Good. Yeah, I feel like I'm starting to get a hang of this. Great. So I actually think I'm going to turn it into my graduation speech. Oh wow. Just the fundamental ideas and stuff. If you need any help, just let me know. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Mr. Block Lucy, I'm sorry I didn't see that. Its Okay. Sorry. I'm just kind of Freaking out. Why. You don't have exams. No, no. It's not that it's my parents. They're on their way to the house right now. The same house that we left a mess from Saturday night. Yeah. They see I have a party, I'm dead. Why don't you just go clean it up? I can't do that, I have class. Right now. Actually. I have to go. I'm sorry. But what if I'm with you? - Really? - Yeah Okay. Let's go. But we have to go right now. Come on. You need to start coming to these parties more often I've only seen you here a couple of times. I think this is it. Cool. Okay, thank you. I'm just gonna freshen a bit. Okay cool. I'll be right back. And I'll be here. Hey Ralph, there's someone here. You know who's car that is? Oh crap. That is my parents. Are you serious. Wow. Timing. What do we do? Okay. Act natural. Come this way. I sure wish we would got more to eat. No, no, this is perfect. Thank you. It's dad and I's 25th anniversary today son. Yeah. 25 years, congratulations. Happy anniversary. Thank you. A hundred year, quarter the way to a 100 years. It feels like a hundred years. So Lucy, tell us about your speech. Ah, dad, come on. That's kind of rude. No, I think Ralph's just saying that cause he hasn't come up with anything. You do have something son? I got something cooking up. It's about sacrifice like of a soul. You know, our parents sacrifice their sanity. Our teachers sacrifice their time, I guess it's really about like what it means to be called by God to do something and then giving of yourself in order to achieve the greater good. What made you choose the subject? No, it was a writing prompt in class, but I don't know. I'm still working on it. And you won't hear about that shooting last night? Yeah. It was right in the Valley. It was in my neighborhood actually. Really? Yeah. She was an abortion doctor so. Yeah but that doesn't mean she deserved to die or anything though, right? I mean she basically had it coming. Right. The whole thing just makes me sick. Ralph, what do you like about them? World series. What he's saying? We ought to get us season tickets this year. What do you say? Yeah, definitely that'd be awesome. It sure would be. I'll tell you what Six curve ball coming up over the top. He set the betters up with followed by that 100 mile an hour fast ball lights out. I'm sitting over there at first base. If strike out a hell of a lot. Once you make it. Thanks for the pizza mom. Yeah. Thank you. You're very welcome. We're gonna head out. Thanks for having me. You are freakishly good with coming up with lies on the spot. Like we're working on our papers that you sold that perfectly. That was amazing. Thank you for, for keeping me out of trouble that you really helped me out back there. All right. I'm going to say something that you don't have to respond. In fact, I kind of, you kind of prefer you don't. Okay, so we're getting towards the end of high school. You know, it's really is life as we know it and I'm sorry, this all sounds so weird coming out of my mouth. No no, go on. I like you. I have for a while now. And I don't know. I was just wondering, is there, is there a reason you've been hanging out with me so much recently? I'm sorry. You don't have to answer that. No. I like you too. You do? Mmh. Cool. To Miss Diana, Dr. Gleeson, Bauer, faculty, staff, and most of all, my inspiring classmates, congratulations. Our education at the Theophilus has not been for the faint of heart. God calls us to follow him with conviction and our little school implores us to take this responsibility seriously. Outside these walls there's a scary world waiting for us. Armed with this education it is our obligation to go out there and make things right. Did you update your whole morality thing for your speech? You just have to wait and see. All right guys come on, come on, move, move. I'm going to have everybody line up alphabetically in the foyer and I want everybody quiet. The lowerclassmen are still in their exams. Hurry up. Come on, Let's move. Everybody out. Thank you. Quietly Ballad, Ashton, Black, Cooper, Cranston, Dave. Sorry if its cold. Can you do me a favor I've promised I'd give you all the nuts for Cal. I rescheduled my followup appointment for today. Come on please. I was just going last week. I'd rather not. Please. I don't have a car. Your mom to take you. She thinks I went last week. You are all going to line up right outside? Soon as trumpets starts playing that's when you process and you take your seats. Everybody understood? Please, Lucy. Can you ask Mavis to take you? Mavis doesn't know. Okay. I can drop you off and pick you up. Never mind. Look, I just don't feel comfortable going. There was some times friendship means doing things that you don't want to do. You like that stupid can food drive that you made me help you with. Seriously, you always bring this up. That was freshman year and it's not like, this is the same. Fine, I'll go. Really? Yeah. I told you I was here for you. Whatever you need, right? Girls, your practice hasn't started yet, has it? We were just heading back. Did you turn in your speech? Yeah to Miss Diana just a little while ago? I'm gonna What's the matter? Gotta go talk to Miss Diana. Wait did I do something wrong? What's going on? I have no idea. All right guys. I'm sorry for the interruption. Lucy, Mr. Hooper. I want you to stay after practice. Okay. All right. The commencement speakers are as follows. Her policy number. Sure. I can call back in about 15 minutes. Yeah that works great. Thanks so much. Bye-bye Hi Hi Good morning. I got your message. You said you had something for me? There's nothing on it Right there. What is, what's AMDG? I don't know, but this girl came in a couple of days ago and yeah, it was probably nothing but No it's perfect. Come on back. Both of you need to come prepared to speak, the winnner's gonna find their speech on the podium on the graduation. Okay. After it's submitted no revisions. So its understood? Okay. Lucy, Mr. Block wants to see you in his classroom. Set up. Come on. So I've decided I'm not going to count this as part of your final, I guess your final grade. Not for you and not for anyone else. I really should have taken the time I think to explain it a little bit better. It's just going to have some more consequences with you. Anyway. Look at your paper. By touching that control switch, you're effectively killing someone, But five people's lives are at risk. And you as a third party, you'd be making the decision to kill the hiker. That's not his decision and that's not sacrifice. Not on your part, not on anyone else's I would disagree. I mean, I think that most people would pull the switch. And I think that it's our job to help save the world from disasters like this one. Most people do answer the question like that, but you need to understand the nature of the choice one faces as a hypothetical switch puller to save five people by killing one or to save one by doing nothing. Now the trolley and its passengers they're on a terrible path, but it's one that you just can't save them from. You can't sacrifice the minority to save the majority. That's just not how good society functions. Does that make sense? I'm sorry. I know how much you needed the scholarship. You guys have plans? Rachel's keeping it a secret. Girl things. There're no boys allowed. Okay. Well, Lucy, do you mind if I talk to you a minute, alone? 90 seconds? Sorry you were in a hurry. It's okay. Listen, I thought we did a good job at covering our tracks the other night, but yesterday my dad asked me if I had used any of his firearms. Cause his gun was loaded. It's weird. Cause I saw you unload it. You did. Okay. Thank God. I couldn't remember. I ended up pinning it on my brother, but I'm pretty sure I got away with it. Lucy let's go. Sorry. I gotta go. So we very rarely get to walk-ins but I'm going to see what I can do for you. If you can just fill this out, and I'll let you know if you can fit in. Okay. They're trying to fit me in, but apparently my doctor's not coming in for a while. Okay. I know you don't want to be here but do you mind waiting? Sorry, I don't feel well Yeah. Yeah. Lucy, hallo She's okay? Yeah What's your name? How do you two know each other? Mom, who's Detective Brinkworth? Luc, Oh so glad to see you. I was so worried. How are you feeling? Fine. Who is this guy? This man helped you out, he brought you home from the clinic yesterday. In fact you know what, you owe him a thanks. A big thanks. No, I don't wanna talk to him right now. Mom I don't wanna talk to him right now. Luc, it will only take a second. What has gotten into you? Would you please hang up? Ringing Hi, Detective Brinkworth, Hi yes, this is Mrs. O'Brien. Yes, Lucy is well. Yes I know, I call. Yes, she's actually right here. Do you know Dr. Miriam Parker? Yeah, we are neighbors. Have you visited her at the clinic before? I have. Do you mind telling me why? I do This is just an informal conversation, Lucy. All right. I don't want you to think that I'm prying too hard into your personal matters. But two days before Dr. Parker was shot. I understand that you were at the clinic, you broke a lamp and you left. I also understand that your last visit to the clinic was with a patient of Dr. Parker's. I would rather not discuss my friend's choices. If anything else comes up, I believe you have my contact. Please, thank your mother for the orange juice. And I'll see myself out. One more thing. What is AMDG stand for? Well, it's Latin for the greater glory of God. You're right. Thank you for your time. Hello Lucy O'Brien Huh? Hi is this Lucy? Yeah. Who is this? Hello to a member that I led your tour at Kavela college I'm calling on behalf of the Stover at the Admissions Office, I guess tracking my knowledge. Questions I can answer No, I don't have any questions. Maybe I can have a few more of your time No, I really not like to give you any of my time, and I don't want to hear about any of the benefits or your spiritual journey or anything like that. Cause I don't really care about your school. Kid Walla is a shit hole. No you and your school can go F yourself, Chelsea Davis. Bye. My God I'm sorry for my sins, with all my heart, I'm failing to live above all things I firmly intend with your help to tip in, to sin no more to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us in his name, may God have mercy. Hey, heard you got sick. You okay? I don't know. What's the contrition for, if you don't mind me asking? Nothing. It's something stupid. Well, I have a confession too. I read your paper, the one from Mr. Block's class. And I keep thinking back to that night, when we put the gun back, It wasn't loaded. I'd rather not connect the dots here Lucy. Am I going crazy? Yes. Absolutely. Lucy. You didn't use that gun, did you? No. Okay. Cause I mean, even if you did, you would confess it, right? But I didn't But you would? Listen, I'd love to hang around, but I'm grounded. So I guess I'll see you around. Miss valedictorian. I really didn't even want to come to this though. Mavis, come on its like our last day here. Enjoy it, for me please. This is not in your control and it is not something you can do alone. Really? No, no, no. Leave everything alone, I'm on my way. Yes, I'm coming right now. Okay, bye. And now our very own Theophilus High Class of 1976, Mr. Frank Gleeson. Well, it is my pleasure today. Actually, it's my great pleasure today to provide the following individual with a full scholarship, to the college of their choice so that they can bring the Theophilus education to plant Christ's seed in another community. Wherever that community may be. This year, our valedictorian is Lucy O'Brien. Wow. To Ms. Diana, Dr. Gleeson Bauer, faculty and staff, and most importantly, my inspiring classmates, congratulations. Our education at Theophilus has not been for the faint of heart. God calls us to follow Him and His son with conviction to showcase for all the world and our little school im... I'm Sorry Miss Diana My speech goes against natural law, which means I shouldn't be standing up here right now. And my argument scares me. And it frightens me that at a school so wonderful and religious I explored a line of reasoning that justified a very terrible crime. And now they're awarding me for it, so I guess if we're supposed to go out and plant Christ's seed in the world that's a complicated responsibility. I'm sorry I'm going to have to forfeit my scholarship. Okay. Have a seat. I must say I was not expecting a call from you. I did it. Excuse me. Dr. Parker, the shooting. Lucy, Are you, do you have a boyfriend or is there someone that you don't want your mom to find out about? No. Sorry. What does that have to do with A girlfriend No. I'm not covering for anyone. This is my confession. Okay then. Well, what kind of weapon did you use? A gun. What type? A small one. A handgun. And how did you aim? At the middle. Lucy, I did not mean to come on so strong yesterday, sincerely with such limited evidence. I started reading into things and I feel bad. I feel bad because you're sitting here and you're impressionable and you obviously are driven by guilt of some sort. I'm sorry, I don't follow. Dr. Parker woke up this morning. I could tell he was high on something meth maybe. He wasn't in his right mind. It's entirely my fault, I promise. And he asked for money. So I gave him some cash. And the next thing I knew... That was Dr. Parker's statement from the night she was shot. The suspect is virtually unidentifiable. Is she okay? She will be If you want to visit, she's over at Glenbrook Medical. Lucy, I would consider it a huge favor. If you would keep our little conversation from yesterday to yourself. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Dr. Parker. Should I be concerned about anything? No I I just came to apologize. Your name's Lucy, right? We all make mistakes, Lucy and I didn't want your life to be defined by one. I want you to promise me something. Don't forget what happened. I want you to carry this around, like a secret that stings. One that you're too afraid to tell people. I want you to remember what it feels like to be in such desperation. You and I see two very different sides. Thank you for apologizing, but I hope we never see each other again. I'm sorry. Hey Lucy, Ralph here. I'm just calling to see how you are. If everything's okay. Listen, this is kind of hard for me, but I just wanted to say it's been great. Getting to know you these past few weeks. I've had a lot of fun with you, but it seems like you have some other things going on right now that maybe are out of your control. But I, I just think it'd be best if you know, we go on our separate ways after graduation. And I just think it'd be best if we kept it that way, I guess. Good luck with the next chapter in your life. I'll pray for you. Bye. I wish I could have gone away like you did. But I'm stuck here with my mom, 20 minutes away, Each one about different alternatives other than abortion.
