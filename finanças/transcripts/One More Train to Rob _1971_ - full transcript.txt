Time, honey. So soon? Train's due at 3:10. You're up and dressed. I didn't even hear you. You're not only dressed, you've been out. And from the smell of that perfume, I know where! Now, Katy... Now, you know that by sunup every sheriff within 100 miles... Is going to be coming this way, and I had to set up an alibi... Always have to be a cat house! That's better. I've got to go. Now? Now. Or we'll never make the train. Hi, Bart. Do me the honor, madam. Start tonight, well... when you change trains at Gallup, ma'am, if you'd like I can have your baggage transferred over. Thank you. That's very kind. California, is it? The angels have smiled on me. That's the very place I'm headin' myself. Really? Sorry, ma'am. This close to the engine, cinders blow in. You want it open, lady. Just ask Mr. Nolan. He owns this railroad. That's not quite what I said, laddy. I said I built it... me and 5,000 paddies like me. I'm a commercial traveler now. Gentlemen's Haberdasher. But that's not to say that one day I won't be ridin' this line in me own private car. That's the marvel of this country, sonny. If a man works and saves and invests, there's no tellin' where he can go. Somethin's wrong. They switched to red. What's goin' on here? Why in hell did you stop us on the main instead of... switching us onto the siding? Mister, the Westbound Express is behind us. Your green lighting it to highball right into us. Guess we better hurry. Just stay put. Don't nobody try and be a hero. Hot diggity! It's a hold-up! Tell 'em to open up. Like hell I'll open up! Charlie! They stopped us on the main. The Express is due any minute! To hell with the Express! For the love of God, mister, just let us get this train on the siding. You got eight minutes. To hell with your eight minutes! Another train's coming. It's going to crash into us. Let's get outta here! Stay put! Reverend, an appropriate hymn might be helpful. Wake up, Mom! You're gonna miss everything! Charlie, you've got to open up! Please! She's some ahead of schedule. My God, Charlie! We got women and children on board! Move it. You, get on the floor. Open 'em. Can't. They're tagged to Flagstaff, and that's where the keys are. Get on the floor with him. Tie him up. Quarters. That's better. It's bolted to the floor. Dump the silver and use the sacks. Go right on singin', folks. While everybody's in the spirit, collect the blessings. Everybody have their money and jewelry ready, please. And your personals will be returned to you. We're only interested in valuables. Bless you, brother. Now, wait a minute. Hey! This'll be in my report to the railroad! Hey, come on, stop that now! I'll have that, ma'am. Please, sir. It was a gift from someone very dear to me. Well, he knew quality when he saw it. So do I. You damn scoundrel! Nothin' but dang neckties and sleep garters in this! Well, we'll never use 'em. It's all yours, drummer. Nothin' worth a hoot in this one either. Show's over, folks. Everybody stay on the train. You're some train robber! Ain't you gonna shoot nobody? Him and his bloody jokes. He damn near took the tip off my nose. I think you should mention it in your report to the railroad. Who are ya and where are ya headed? James Abel Gant, sheriff. Next stop Hidalgo Wells. Up pretty early, ain't ya? Experience has taught me the best time to sell a good book is before folks leave to go to church. Bibles, boxes of 'em. Anything wrong, sheriff? Nothin' concernin' you. Up, on your feet. Careful with that thing, mister. Mr. Hilborne says they're workin' for him. Been here for a week buildin' fences. They finished too late yesterday to get to the bank to pay 'em off, so we're goin' into town this mornin'. You sure they were here all last night? With four bits between us, why go anyplace? You search their gear. She don't get up so soon! She going to be mad! Have you gone loco or somethin' bustin' in here like this? This is business. Train was held up a couple hours ago and we're checkin' all strangers. Who are you? Harker Fleet. Passin' through on my way to Texas. Wait a minute, Roy. What time did you say that hold-up was? Three-thirty. Well, that let's him off. He came in here right around twelve o'clock. We got to drinkin' pretty good, and I don't know who passed out first, but I guarantee ya we're both right where you found us since anyways one o'clock. Well, sorry. Anybody in here belong to these? Me. And they belong to my horse outside. This "H.F." stand for Harker Fleet? He's Fleet. You two the law from someplace? No, I'm Eli Jones, and this here's my little brother, Luke. Never heard of ya. He's right up here, Cora Mae! Roy, what the hell's goin' on? I don't know. You're that Jones. Here, Fleet, put on your weddin' clothes. Baby sister's a-waitin'. I hope you got a understandin' preacher in this here town, sheriff. If this is what I think it is, I'll see to it he accommodates ya. You're supposed to be out chasin' train robbers. And you're supposed to be dressin'. You're gettin' better than you deserve in Cora Mae, Fleet. By marriage, she comes into one-third of our ranch. Ain't much to look at right now, but with a little timberin' and a little fencin', I figure with a couple of years' hard work, we're gonna have it whipped. What would you say if I told you I was a train robber? Don't be funny, mister. I got a sister of my own. No, you doooon't! Hark, you all right? No! Hark! Hark! Nothing personal, Cora Mae. Don't hurt him! Don't you worry, we'll get him! What'd you have to go and shoot him for? What for? He is a train robber, isn't he? I hope you ain't shot too bad. I don't wanna have to tote you to the weddin'. How badly was he hurt? Not bad enough. They stood him up and married him in the mornin'. And in the afternoon, took him to the county seat and put him on trial. Trial? For what? He married the girl! The sheriff busted an arm and a leg when Hark took him through Miss Luella's window. And he sloughed a deputy and broke his jaw. Added up, it got him a sentence of three years for felonious assault. At least it'll give him a breather before they start house-breakin' him in Abilene. Not that I'm mean-mouthin' him... but messin' with every woman he laid his eyes on, if you ask me, it was bound to happen. All right. Clear out, lads. We'll divvy up when Katy's more herself. Sure sorry, Kate. Tough luck all around. The black iron of it, Katy, is if he'd listened to me, he'd never of been in Hidalgo Wells. I was against takin' on the job. And you know why I let him talk me into it... In the hope with a good stake in his poke, I could convince him to quit with me. And show him how to run it up into a fortune investin' in land. The bastard! While he was runnin' around in Abilene, I was waitin' for him in San Antonio. Ten miserable days I waited. And when he finally got there, he said he'd been snowed in. Well, 'twas the truth. We were snowed in. That's right. You were with him. What does she... look like this Cora Mae Jones? Cora Mae... I'm not sure if Cora Mae was the librarian... or the girl in the restaurant. It hasn't been an easy life for ya, has it, Katy? But that's Hark. Yep, that's Hark. To hell with him! Katy, there's the money to be cut! See you later! Much later! Everybody says that Yuma prison's a hell hole. I can't bear the thought of it! They're takin' you away today, Hark. I'm not that brave. I just don't want to be here to see it. Will you forgive me? Three years. Three years... That's such a long time! Well, the judge said... a man goin' to prison, that's grounds for a wife to get an annulment if she wants it. Except when there's gonna be a baby. That. You just don't know how much I loved you, Hark! When you left me, I just couldn't stop cryin'. Why? Cora Mae? You are gonna have a baby, aren't you? Whose idea was a baby? Tim Nolan's? Well... Mr. Nolan... How did you know? It just sort of came to me. I'll handle it, Mr. Nolan. Thanks, Josh. It came in on the morning train, Mrs. Nolan. It is all you said... charming. Is it not divine, Mr. Nolan? Isn't that the same hat you tried on in San Francisco last month and didn't like? I changed my mind and had Nanette send for it. And, those, too? I want you to see them all on. I'm due at the barber's. Ladies. Afternoon. Howdy, Mr. Nolan, nice to see you. Be right with you, Mr. Nolan. Thank you, Lawrence. That Nolan fella you were talkin' to, would that be Timothy Xavier Nolan? Sure is. I had a cousin who married a Timothy Xavier Nolan. Wife's name be Alice? Nope. Mrs. Nolan's name is Katy. Caught it in a bear trap. Bad news? Just news. That's the only letter you got the whole time you've been here. It's the only one I need, George. It tells me where to find some things that belong to me. Won't be long now, will it? 'Nother month? Twenty-six days. All right, on your feet. We're gonna make that train to San Francisco, you better hop-to. Be tolerant of our customs, please. We must frighten away any demons that might bring misfortune upon us. Drop your guns! Open them all if you wish. They contain the same thing... Rocks. The gold bouillon... where is it? Safe from thieves. We expected you. Kill me also. Why do you wait? No. Because you're comin' with us. Easy, now. Easy. It was bandits. You savvy? Bandits. They take us by surprise, kill your friends, and take the old man. And left you with your guns, deputy? My grandfather was right to distrust you. Who are you? Please, son. What's a white man doin' throwin' in with a bunch of chinks? Just helpin' keep the peace, deputy. Where you from? Calador. I'd have bet money on that. Come back here, damn you! Would you get back where you belong? Any more trouble outta you and I'll whip the hide off ya! Monty, quick! Sheriff. Don't stand there. Cut him loose! What the hell is this all about? My grandfather has been kidnapped and two of our people murdered. And these deputies you sent us were in league with the men who did it. And they nearly got us killed for nothin'. They were expectin' to be bushwhacked. We weren't escortin' no gold. It was rocks. Look, you, it's one thing askin' the law to protect you, but usin' my deputies as decoys, I have a mind to throw you all in jail! Ask them where my grandfather has been taken. It is your duty to find him. I'll look into it. Now, you clear outta here! You're cluttering up the street! We'll go when these men are jailed for being accomplices to murder and kidnapping. You talk good. Whoever taught you, must've taught you the law. But it won't do you no good chargin' anybody with anything. A Chinaman can't bring a complaint against a white man, and he can't testify against him in court neither! Maybe a Chinaman can't, sheriff, but I can. You'd be delighted to know that you've got a eyewitness to the whole thing! I told you to git! Now, clear out! Clear outta here, all of ya! Go on, git! Nothin' to gawk at. Go about your business. Mister, I got some advice for you... Wherever you're headin', you just keep movin'. I intend to. Tell me... do you know where Timothy Xavier Nolan's place is? You know Mr. Nolan? Old friends. Used to work in the railroad together. Now... let's get this complaint thing settled out. How do you spell "accomplice"? With an "s" or a "c"? Manuel, get Nolan. Hello, Jimmy! You look miserable. Stomach gas? Thought you weren't gettin' out for another six months. Hark... Hark! Lord, boy, it's good to see ya! You weren't due out till March. You didn't walk off, now, did ya? Good behavior. Come in, come in. Mr. Nolan... I think the sheriff's bustin' to tell ya somethin'. It'll keep. Marty, I'll see ya in town tomorrow. It's really urgent, Mr. Nolan. All right. Manuel, fix Mr. Fleet a whiskey. Katy! I'll be with ya in a minute. Thanks, friend. Wait a minute. Rocks! Shut up! What do you think of the place? Ee. What's keepin' Katy? Maria? Sí, señor? Tell Mrs. Nolan. Mr. Fleet is here. Bien, señor. Tim, Marty's waitin'. Jimmy, will you give me a minute? Ain't that big of a thing to get straightened out, is it? This wouldn't be about those two deputies in the cooler, would it? It comes to me, one's named Gant. Kin of yours? My brother. Hart, lad, you're not aware of the order of things in these parts. Sidin' a Chinaman against a white man... It just isn't taken kindly. I noticed. The less said about the little fracas you ran into this afternoon the better for all. You'd like me to tell the sheriff to tear up that complaint. Considerin' it'd be a favor to Jimmy here, I'll sleep on it. I want Bert out now! Right now! Jimmy! I should've known he was your brother, the way he kept talkin' about cuttin' me up for fish bait. Jimmy! They'll stay where they are for now. Tell Monty. Well, now, Hark... Katy. Hello, Hark. That painter cheated you. She's prettier than that. Last we heard you had another six months to serve. Everybody kept track. I'm touched. He said he had time off for good behavior. Good behavior? You. Marriage must've calmed you down. How are your wife and child, by the way? Fine, thank you. Just fine. Are they with you? No. Little Timothy's a might young to travel. Timothy? Yes, it was Cora Mae's idea to call him Timothy. It sure surprised me! Why, I didn't know you'd more than said hello to her in Abilene. Am I invited to dinner? Of course. That goes without sayin'. I could stand a wash. Scrape off some of this trail dust. You certainly could. Upstairs. The spare room is the one on the right. Manuel will bring you some hot water. I got some clean clothes in my bedroll. I almost forgot. I didn't kiss the bride. Hope I didn't spoil your supper by not talkin' when we were eatin'. It's a habit I got into in prison. Gonna take me some time to get over it. Is that another habit you picked up in prison? Yeah. Haven't got back to cigars yet. Can't afford 'em. Why don't you try one of these? They were made especially for me in... San Francisco. Thanks. There are no spittoons. Not in this house. That's all right. Let's talk about money. What about my share of the last job? I hope you didn't blow it all on chandeliers and silver. It's invested for ya. Every penny of it. Right along with mine, Katy's and Jimmy's. What about Red and Slim? They took their poke and bought a spread in Wyoming. How much? Your end came to 9,000. We made the usual split... sixty percent between the two of us. Maria? Bring Mr. Fleet a bucket or somethin'. Is that an honest count, Katy? I did the countin' myself. I thought it was more. It's not half bad to come home to. Cora Mae and little Timothy sure could've used some of it. Things have been mighty lean for 'em. What did you want us to do, send someone or go ourselves? And say, "Here's your husband's share of the robbery money"? Tim would've found a way if he'd put his mind to it. You'll not regret what's happened to your money. It's done considerable drawing, right along with ours. You mean all this, all those places in town, I'm a partner? Now, don't play the rue, Hark. You know damn well what Tim has has nothing to do with you. Are you forgetting the brawls we near came to? Because of me preachin' money, begets money? And should be invested and not squandered away? It did no good. You didn't want roots. And while you were blowin' every cent that came your way, I was savin'... planning investments from the first dollar I earned. That's a pot of Irish. He means the first dollar he stole. How much has my 9,000 begotten? When we ship cattle to market, it'll be doubled. Fifteen thousand. Not Bad. It ought to last a while in the best suite and the fanciest hotel in Frisco. Katy... I've been tryin' all evening to remember what this place puts me in mind of. The presidential suite we stayed in for a week in St. Louis. It isn't like it at all. Sure it is. Of course, there was chandeliers and... satin pillows. What a week that was. Don't tell me you don't remember. All I remember about St. Louis is that you lost all our money playin' poker. We had to sneak out of the hotel, and I had to leave every stitch of clothes I owned! Except what I had on my back. Yep! We sure had some times. And now here we are, both married, only you to Tim and me to Cora Mae. It's like a penny dreadful, isn't it? It's Reverend Pedegril and Mr. and Mrs. Williams. I clean forgot I told them to drop by. We're throwin' a barbecue here tomorrow night to thank the contributors of the school building fund. I'm sure a man like you is just loaded down with... civic responsibilities. Well... Hark! I guess I'm not fit company for a reverend. Good evening, reverend. Mrs. Williams. John. Come in. Quiet, John! Manuel, take him to the house. Not in Chinese. Your grandson can read English. Well, Mr. Chang? How different the circumstances, Mr. Nolan, of this meeting and our last. You came to me, a respected businessman, to negotiate a loan. You made a bad mistake turnin' me down. Now write what you've been told! It will serve no purpose. Even if I instruct my people to deliver the gold to you, they don't know where it is hidden. But, of course, you know this, Mr. Nolan. The gold for shipment is not stored in the mine. He's squirrelin' the stuff. So it's up to him to tell us where it's at. Good Lord, man, do you value your gold above your life? My life was without value the moment I was brought here. You don't dare let me live. So that's what's worryin' ya? Mr. Chang, you can't bring charges against me. Thanks to livery laws your Chinamen are always squawkin' about, I can set you free in a minute and never give it a second thought. I am human, therefore I am not without fear of dying. But the gold is not mine. It belongs to the Heaven and Earth Association. An for an elder of the tong to hurt many lives to save one, especially his own... would be unworthy. For the next ten minutes, I'm going to give thought to Jimmy's solution. I suggest, Mr. Chang, you give it some thought, too. Now, shut the doors. I want nothing heard up at the house. Come in. Sorry I wasn't here when you dropped in before. Where have you been? Same Katy. Same tone, same question. I'm sure glad Cora Mae doesn't have a suspicious mind. Hark, I want a straight answer. Now where the hell have you been? What have you been up to? And you can stop tossin' Cora Mae and your child at me because if you think it bothers me, it doesn't. Not at all? Not one damn bit. Then you're probably not interested that she had the marriage annulled the day after the wedding, and there never was a child. The only conceiving done was in the mind of that famous marriage broker, Timothy Xavier Nolan. I don't believe it. And why shouldn't you believe it? It gave him a clear shot at you, didn't it? And he sure got what he aimed for. Well, you weren't just playing a game at supper, were you? Well, what are you trying to do, Hark, prod Tim into a fight so you can kill him? No. That'd be stupid. He's got Jimmy Gant and a dozen guns. Besides, I didn't like him well enough to be buried with him. Now, you will admit, he deserves a little rap on the knuckles for three years and a chain gang, but after that, I'll take my money and you, and we'll be on our way. You really think I'm just gonna pick up and go with you? I've got a surprise for you! I like being Mrs. Timothy Nolan. I like being married to a kind, honest man. I like living in my own home instead of some... some fleabag hotel. I... I like being... Being respectable, instead of always on the run, just... just one jump ahead of the law, and most of all, Harker Fleet, especially I like having you out of my system. It took eight of the most miserable months of my life before I married Tim, but it was worth it to get you out, and you are out. Damn. Damn you. Damn you to hell. Hark. Wrong time, wrong place, Katy. You bastard! What are you trying to do, test me? Now, what's that supposed to mean? If Tim has me killed, he loses you. He knew that, now I know it. You're not gonna go jumping back into bed with my murderer. You know what? I just might murder you myself! Now, Katy... Katy! Katy! Do not set the place on fire. Ice it. It'll keep till morning. Now, clear out! I'm going up to bed. Well, the closet or under the bed? Get him out of here, Tim! Give him his money, and get him out! That's for Cora Mae, my used-to-be wife. That's... for little Timothy Fleet, may he rest in peace. The prison thing. It... it was never meant to happen, you know. As long as it was a choice between Cora Mae and you, I'm not complaining. I'll murder ya! My own wife in my own house! What the hell kind of friend are you, anyway? No worse than you, friend. Keeping a calendar on me all the time I was in prison! You were gonna send Jimmy Gant or somebody else out to see I never got back, right? I'll not deny it crossed my mind. But now that we know all that Katy wants to see of you is the back of your head, there's no need to kill ya. That must come as a big relief to you, Tim. I'll make you a fast deal. Give me 10,000, you keep the profits. What time does the bank open? Well, you're very generous, but... You're broke. A temporary shortage of cash, that's all. I'll be getting your money for you in a couple of days. Not from that old Chinaman, you won't. I left one of your hired hands hanging from the hayloft. You didn't really try to borrow the money from the old man, did ya? I did. And I suppose you talked yourself into it. You'd pay him back. I would've. Cattle and land prices are down now, but six months, they'll be back up and higher. You know the... the difference between you and me? You'd never admit you're a thief. I mean, you wanna be an honest man. You just can't get the hang of it. Me... I'm a thief. And I can't think of a more enjoyable way to make a living. You wouldn't be entertaining the notion of getting the Chinaman's gold for yourself, now, would you? It's over 100,000. If I said I wasn't interested, you'd know I was lying. And that's why you wanted Bert, Gant, and Skinner kept in jail? To get the bloody heathens to trust you, right? That's part of it. Now the gold's lost to you, let's drink to me having better luck. Hark, lad! I've got men covering every route on those hills. That gold can't get more than 50 yards without me knowing. I've also got Mr. Chang. On your own, you've got nothing! Neither have you. The old man's outfoxed ya. He won't talk, and you don't dare beat him for fear of killing him. Now, where's that leave us? It looks like we're back in business together. Right. Now, who else is in for the split? Or just you and me? I knew it was coming to that. The bank in San Francisco won't extend me naught. I owe them $100,000. With me holdings wroth five times that much, they're waiting like vultures to swoop down and foreclose. Tim. How many times have I tried to tell you that banks are not to do business with? They're to rob. Well... you said yourself there's much more than 100,000 now. Everything over is yours. Hark, for the love of sweet Christ, don't back off now! I'm bloody near destroyed! Well, it wouldn't be the first bad deal I've made. But I'll need some pocket money. How much? Twenty, forty. I'll bill anything else to you I need. You know, it's going to be very difficult to tell Katy about us being partners again. Does she know about the gold? Nope. And I don't want her to know. I don't blame you. It's very important to her that you're respectable. But she'll ask questions. And you know how it is with me and Katy. I never could lie to her. Anybody home? Anybody home? Why don't you look before you swing? Don't you recognize me? Where's Yung? Tell him Harker. Fleet... Yung, what the devil... What are you doing? Here. Put me down. Put me down! That's enough, you damned heathen. You call us heathen? No right-thinking Christian would go up against a man with a gun on him. Now, call him off! Why are you here? To help you out. I told you yesterday I would. What's happened since then? I was your friend, you were ready to... You and that dog Nolan are friends. You're staying at his house. Now, look, if we could just have a sensible talk... Get out. Or I'll hand you over to Wong again. All right. I'm going. You've gotta be loco. She's backdoor trade. What's wrong with the other girls? Knock. Toy! You awake? You up? Yes, Madam Nellie. I got a customer for you. Paid for 20 minutes. You want out sooner, stomp on the floor. Good morning, sir. Very pleased. How come you're locked in? Madam Nellie wishes it so. It is a custom with my people to have tea first. If you no want tea, we go to bed. You better... You better fix the tea. It'll make it easier for me to keep my mind on what I came here to talk about. You came to talk? Yeah, about Yung. He's a friend of yours, isn't he? More than a friend. He loves you? I think yes. Well, he's up to his neck in trouble. He needs help. And I'm willing to help him. Why you come to me? Why you not tell this to Yung? He won't listen to me. That's where you come in. He'll listen to you. On the way out to the mine, I'll convince you. I only wanna be his friend. You think to take me to the mine? Well, why not? You're willing, aren't you? And Madam Nellie? Well, five dollars for 20 minutes, $50 will buy us more than enough time to get there and back. She no let me go for less than $500. $500? That is price she pay for me. She no take chance I run away. Two time I try. Well, who sold you? Me sell me. When my father die, my mother she need money to take small brother to home China. They not happy here. So I get money. Well, get out of that and into something you wear on a horse. Well, you got something else, haven't ya? Yes. Why couldn't you get the money you needed from Yung? Was before Yung and Honorable Chang come to Calador. He save now to buy me, but no have money yet. Couldn't he borrow it from his grandfather? The Honorable Chang do not approve of what I am. Maybe it's better for Yung I no go. No! It's better if you go. The Honorable Chang will not only approve of ya, he'll love ya. You think yes? I'm sure yes. You're not going to pay Madam Nellie $500? Someday. Morning, Katy! I knew he was a loony! Wouldn't have a white girl! Had to have the Chink! Maybe we'd better stop for a while and let you unkink? No. I fine! In China, we say when happy, make everything feel good. You make it so I happy. Yeah... I figured with the right kind of present, I might buy five minutes talking time. Who could that be? Everybody on the list is already here. Why, she's Chinese! I've had my men out searching for that little... Watch your language! She's my guest. What in hell do you think you're doing? Goodwill. She's the first step to the gold. Be sure everybody's nice to her. I like your tailor. He'll be getting the bill. Miss Toy. Our host... Mr. Nolan. I'm glad you've come. His presence offends Miss Toy. Better send him home. Good evening, Katy. This is Miss Toy. Our hostess... Mrs. Nolan. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Very kind of you. Katy, please. Don't you get upset, now, and make a scene. Why should anything he does upset me? What's the matter? What'd you say? Best I can recollect, "". That does it. What the hell do you think you're doing? He insulted my girl. Hark! Jimmy, drop it! Drop it! Thanks. We go now, Mr. Fleet, please. I'm sorry we can't stay for supper. But it was a real fine party. I can't think when I've had a nicer time. Please come, Mr. Fleet. Thanks. My grandson looks upon you as our savior, Mr. Fleet. Not only did you devise the means to rescue me... And for this I am grateful... But Yung also believes you can perform the miracle of getting our gold safely to San Francisco. It's no miracle. It's a matter of the know-how to handle Nolan. Why, Mr. Fleet? It is, ungracious to question a benefactor, but I must. Why, at peril to yourself, do you help us? Well, I guess you can thank Toy for that. She told me about what your town does with the money. That it goes to our sick and poor and the very old. And this touched you. A man'd have to be made out of stone not to be touched. But how is it you... you offered your friendship to Yung before you knew of Toy or what purpose our gold served? Could it be that you were then thinking of... getting the gold for yourself? I was. But now you've had a change of heart. Mr. Chang, if there was any way I could steal that gold, I would. But there's no way. Not with Nolan's men covering every route out of here. How then do you hope to get it out for us? With Nolan's help. I'll deliver the gold to him, he'll put it on the first train, ten miles outside Calador, we stop the train and take over. Simple as that. Simple? Mr. Chang, robbing trains is my profession. That is hardly a recommendation for trust, Mr. Fleet. I am, bewildered by your frankness. I'm bewildered by everything about you. Well, maybe if I told you about Nolan and me... This is another thing to which I cannot adjust my mind. You are a guest in his house, yet you speak of betraying him. Isn't it more likely it is us you will betray? That you are working with Nolan and that even my escape was arranged between you? Mr. Chang, I came to Calador to kill Tim Nolan. He stole my woman from me and almost three years of my life. He snags the woman. If I kill him, I lose her. Now, the next best payoff is to take everything from him that makes his life worth living. Without your gold, he's destroyed. I, scolded Yung as foolish when he insisted you were helping us because you're a humane, good man. In the wisdom of my years, I could not accept this, but now that you tell me your reasons are evil, for cruel revenge, I find it easy to accept and understand. This will be difficult for me to... to explain when I go to my ancestors. Jimmy, you better stay here. I'm going if you have to tie me on. Well, I'll be damned! The almighty gall of ya. We were just heading out to find you! I thought you might, so I hurried. The Chinese wanted proof I was on their side, so I gave it to them. By letting the old Chinaman slip away? He was my ace in the hole. He wasn't worth two deuces in the barn. I... It's all right. I told her. You're forgiven for breaking up the party, but, you coulda saved Tim a lot of name-calling if you'd just let us know what you were up to. Easier doing things my way. I got myself hired to deliver that gold to San Francisco. They're just gonna hand it over to ya? Tomorrow night, 9:00. $116,000 worth. It took a lot of persuading. I could use a drink. They let you see it? You counted it? I saw it, I didn't count it. I take their word for it. Where the devil did they hide it? In the explosives cave. Two ingots to a can of blasting powder, and if that gives you any ideas, forget it. They got it rigged to blow a stranger to hell. It's all too easy. That old Chink's smart. Tim... you got a higher opinion of Mr. Chang than he has of you. I persuaded him your men'd be looking for a heavy guarded shipment. They wouldn't even bother to stop a carriage with just me in it. The San Francisco train comes through on Tuesday. Why is he letting you bring the gold out Sunday night? There's a whistle stop midnight freight. No Wells Fargo car, no guards. Mr. Chang's waiting for me to take it. Wanna know how I sold him on it? By guaranteeing that you didn't have the brains to think of it. Well, I'll not make a liar out of ya. That's the way the gold will get there, only it'll be me taking it. You won't mind if I meet you on the road. We'll come back here together and make the count. 100,000 to me, and the rest to you. Yeah, I thought you'd wanna meet me. Well, Katy, bring out the glasses. We've got some celebrating to do. Me for bed. I've had a busy day. Your boys are still outside. Jimmy might just be riled enough to take a potshot at me through the window. You can't afford that. Lord love him. It's my welfare the lad's always thinking of. Him turning thief doesn't bother you at all, does it? You're just as happy about seeing that gold as he is. Happy, Hark? He'd fall apart if he was broke. And I'd feel like a bitch leaving him. When you walked through that door, it was all over for Tim and me. You knew it. It just took me a little longer to realize it. We better stay right here. This could turn into a hell of a situation. Wherever you go when you leave here, take me with you, please. Can you still pack in five minutes? In two, if I have to. Are you that tired you can't make the stairs? I just thought of another problem. Don't get over-eager and come closer than the first turn-off to the mine. And come alone. Leave your army here. The Chinese might hear 'em and get spooked. Laddy, boy, you might've sold the Chinese I was stupid, but you know better. Jimmy, what are you doing? This damn rattler was nesting in there. What in blazes? It's all there, Nolan! Hark, lad. What fool game are you playing? You had your little joke. Have done with it! The gold bars are worth 4,000 each. Throw my share on the ground. Quit stalling, Nolan! Four of 'em! Jimmy, you come on out and get in the carriage. And gallop those horses, don't walk 'em! Yah! Nice and quiet. Run over there and get that gold for me. No. Run and you might have a chance. Three more seconds here and you're a dead man. One, two... Don't shoot! It's me, Lynn! I got him. Boyle, you get the horses. Mr. Fleet! Get down! There's more across the road! You know, Wong is there. You know, I... I went to a lot of trouble to get you those guns. Why didn't you use 'em? We have missed. Put me down, you overgrown ox! Well, thank him anyway. Get the guns and ammunition. The hatchets, too. You took the chance of them killing you for us, didn't you? Not exactly. Nolan did your people a favor. He didn't show up alone. So... nothing's changed. Put it in the wagon. Now, what is she doing here? How you make robbery without me? They no speak English. Yeah... Ridiculous, isn't it? It is better to have more than one with you to translate. And we told my grandfather Toy was needed to help and was not afraid. This pleased the Honorable Chang. He smiled at me. This changes things some. Get two of those horses, hitch 'em to the wagon. We'll have to meet the train at a different place, a lot further. Hoo! Yee-haw! Manuel, take a trunk to the barn and we'll re-pack it. You can all watch if you like. Where's Hark? Katy, come into the house. He's dead, isn't he? It was him or me, Katy. He came at me shooting. He was like a madman. It must've been in his mind to kill me when he came here. And I went to meet him alone like he asked. You heard him! Let it be, Tim. Nothing happened I wasn't afraid of from the start. I hoped he was... It was a fool hope. Tim, you better come out here quick. Easy, now. Hark's alive. Just him and the Chinks. No sign of our men. Get into town and bring Monte with every man he's got. We're going after him. No, you bloody fool. He'll be going after us. Now, roust out whatever hands are left. We'll need every gun. Eddie, look! What's happening? I don't know! Everybody behave. Nobody'll get hurt. Mister, we're... we're only carrying freight and livestock. Chinese train robbers?! We ask your pardon, sirs. In San Francisco, I will compensate the railroad for the inconvenience. What are you trying to do, give my profession a good name? Mr. Nolan. If what you're moving is that valuable, you need all these men, it's against the company rule to take it on ordinary freight. You'll have to wait for a Wells Fargo car. Mr. Kleinschmidt. My company gives the railroad a lot of business. I don't think they'd like you offending a good customer. I'm not sticking my neck out. If somebody else wants to, all right. I'll telegraph the super's office. Well? What are you waiting for? Get it over there. Damn it, you didn't have to kill him! All right, come on, come on! Katy! What are you doing here? Hark isn't dead, Tim. You wouldn't have all those men with you if he were. Katy, go home. You're expecting him to hit the train, aren't you? In Heaven's name, girl, go home, please! How far back do the lies go? Tell me! Now, Hark was right about you, wasn't he? Wilson! Drive Mrs. Nolan home, and see that she stays there till I get back. Think back to how things were for us before. They can be the same again. Blow whistle again, please. Always is two whistle when train come to station. Eddie, we're never gonna make this stop. All right. This'll do. Get this crate over here. Monte, get up to the engine. I don't want anybody looking for the baggage, man. Five are riding here with me, the rest up front. Front for me. I want Hark. Come on, get it aboard! Get the crate over here, Jimmy. Come on! Get this trunk off! Go back. Take my word, I can use this. Get off. They're coming out the back! His signal. You go now, please. Fast. Come on! Let's get the hell out of here! Jimmy, get back! Hark, you bloody idiot! The gold's getting away! It's lost the both of us! Yeah, but I don't feel so bad! I got myself invited to a Chinese wedding. To give the bride away. You mean to say it was in your mind to let them keep the gold? You can't stand it, can ya? Neither can I. Jimmy? As soon as I start firing... Hark! Katy, get out of here! Do what he says! Get out of here! Yah! It's over for ya, laddy, boy! Damn it! You're the devil's own son, Hark. Lord love ya. You're grieving for me. Katy, I'll find no peace if I thought I'd left you uncared for. The ranch and all, they've got to be saved. Hark can do it for ya. Me? The Chinamen, Hark. They're your friends. They'll lend you the money. When you pay them back, there'll be nothing but riches for you and Katy. Half a million dollars, lad. That's more than you can steal in a lifetime. Promise... promise me you'll... look after things for her. You'll not let her lose anything. You're sweet, darling. I beat you after all. You're a rancher now. Who knows? A month, six months, you may even come to like it. The favor I owed you, Katy. I hobbled and saddled him for you. His wild... stallion days are over. Get the carriage. We'll take him home. That untrustworthy son of a bitch. He's done it to me again.
