To curb the rising crimes in metro cities, especially in Kochi the Kerala police have formed a new division. The Metro Crime Stopper Cell. This experimental division, MCSC established in Kochi has completed three months today. If you suspect a criminal activity you can contact the Metro Crime Stopper Cell by phone, fax, mail or post. Senior officer, IG Chandrashekhar heads this division. -Yes? -Sir, IG Chandrashekhar? He is in a meeting with the Director General. He'll be here in half an hour. The purpose of MCSC is to curb the rising crime rates in metro cities. It's been three months since its inception. Your comments? Has your target been realized? -That is-- -Excuse me. The official media briefing will be given to you by our IG. He will be here soon. Sir, I am Ebby Kuriakose from News Today. The ADG of Police told me that you'll be here to report. I am very happy to meet you. -Really? -Yes, Sir. I'm glad you are here. Ebby, I'll join you shortly. This guy... He seems to show all characteristics of a growing viper. I'll deal with him. That viper is in for trouble. Rashid. -Remember that maid you arranged for me? -Yes. She left. ADGP Ajayan's wife is paying her a thousand rupees more. I cannot compete with her financially. -So... -We'll look out, Sir. -You mean, the same lady? -No, Sir. A new one. -Is it troublesome to you? -Of course not. Alright. -But I want one as soon as possible. -Sir. Get rid of your usual tactics to force and threaten them to work. I've stopped doing that. Don't stop it completely. If it gets you results, carry on. I am unable to manage all alone. Ebby, what do you want to know? It's been three months since the crime stopper cell has come into being. By what percent have you been able to curb the crime rate in the city? Percentage? Talking about percentages won't help. I mean that journalists should have a broader perspective. Reality is often beyond statistics. Isn't that true? True, Sir. Did you have your breakfast? -What? -Have you had your breakfast? -Yes, Sir. -I see. You've recorded enough. Now switch off the camera. Sir, for some time you've kept away from policing. You were handling the printing department and certain corporations as well. According to rumors, the DGP has pressurized you into accepting this. Why have you distanced yourself from policing, Sir? Have you read this book? No, Sir. Sir, you haven't answered my question. Your job is to ask questions. Giving answers is my prerogative. You are passionate about chess. You have competed at the national level. The one who anticipates his opponent's moves, wins the game. Haven't you heard the term "Grandmaster"? The one who can predict the 64 moves of his opponent, is the grandmaster. I've always insisted that you shouldn't be calling and disturbing me. I don't run a bakery like your father. A cop that cops? No. I was just confirming if you really were a policeman. Not necessary. I am busy shopping. I have a meeting with the ADGP. What's wrong with you? As per statistics of the past six months there's hardly a six percent decrease in the crime rate. Your division is not all that effective. I want some feedback. Sir, I mean... Enough, I get it. So... he is still negligent in his job. Chandra was one of the best officers I've ever seen. If you lose your family, you've lost everything. One of the most expensive criminal lawyers in this city. To achieve that position she had to renounce her family ties. There were professional clashes between a police officer and a criminal lawyer. Its anti-climax was their separation. Chandra was shattered. He stopped concentrating on his work. After nine years I've managed to get him at the law and order division. But, he is still... -Kishore. -Sir? It should not end as a failed project. If Chandrashekhar does not give results, I'll replace him. When you asked me to join you for lunch I never expected a surprise like this. It's been ages since I met your daughter. When was the last time? The previous school day you had come along with dad. Yes. I never get your daughter's name right. -I just don't get it. -My name? Dakshayini Chandrashekhar. Why didn't you come last weekend? I waited for you. I've said this over the phone. I had a special tuition to attend. If I had met you, I would've been late to get back there. It's not practical, I understand. I was just asking. I get only two days a month to spend with you. I've told mom that I will spend the entire summer vacation with you. But before that, you have to get off law and order and make sure you are free. We have to freak out! I'll make a move. Hope you remember everything I said. Tomorrow, my theater camp begins. You have to be there by 10 a.m. 7,000 rupees is the fee. Mom is not willing to shell out a single penny. She doesn't want me to practice drama. Goodbye. Hold on. How is your mom? Tonight, mom is going to ask me the same thing about you. Why don't you call and find out for yourself? To get the call through I need to dial all the digits correctly. Even a single digit dialed wrong would be a wrong number. Your mom and I have a minimum of three digits wrong between us. Not three digits. Rather, three letters. I am in the cellar. Any leads in that kidnapping case? -At least in this case... -Don't avoid the questions. Regarding that incident, a complaint from... -Sheeba. -Sheeba. Her father registered the complaint a while ago. We've started the investigations. That's all I have to say. Madam, please. This is a serious issue. Two of Sheeba's friends, Preethi Kurien and Chitra Pillai are already missing. They are missing since four days. Sheeba has also been kidnapped. There's an obvious connection. The connection, if any, is for us to investigate. The media need not take up the job of the police. Mr. Amal Kuriakose. Did you witness the abduction? Yes, Sir. Sir, an abduction has occurred. One Ms. Sheeba, an undergrad student of St. Mary's College has been abducted by a youngster. About two hours ago. We have an eye witness too. The crime has already been committed? How can we deal with it? Let them handle it. The eye witness named Siraj is a driver. He was in a car parked at the cellar where the incident took place. He managed to click a couple of photos when the crime was taking place. But the culprit's face is not very clear. This person is a close friend of constable Sugathan. When he reported the incident, we asked him to come here. Sir. On my way out of the mall I saw a car drive by at great speed. I barely missed being hit. That's when you called him? Sir, this has come to us directly. After the abduction, the girl's father has been hospitalized due to chest pain. Her mother is getting furious at the commissioner's office. She claims that this abduction is conspired by the girl's father. The victim was with her father, the last couple of days. Yes, Sir. I need to speak to the commissioner. I'll hold. Describe everything in detail. Let me hear it. So, while you were in the car he was speaking to someone over the phone. Yes, Sir. -Non-stop? -Yes. -Continuously? -Yes, Sir. The approximate length of the conversation? About 20 minutes. There was no mobile network in the cellar. The girl had mentioned that there was no network there. You've said so too. You had to step out to call Sugathan, right? Yes, Sir. But that young man spoke for 20 minutes on his phone. Which mobile service provider has a range inside that cellar car park? There must be a tower near that mall that made it possible for the culprit's phone to stay connected for 20 minutes. Now nab the person who received his call. Sir, the commissioner is on the line. She called back since the call was disconnected earlier. The old Chandrashekhar is back! Jerome Jacob alias Jerry residing at 3A, Cloud 9, Chembumukku. Is this the culprit? Yes, Sir. Yes, he is the one. Sir, Jerome was talking to his mother that day. We have brought her here. He is not a normal guy. He's into smoking and drugs. He's very attached to his mom. He talks to her endlessly when he is excited. Hasn't he called you after that incident? No, Sir. His phone is switched off. Please wait. Pannangavu tower 2618 indicates that his mobile is switched off. They own a property nearby. It's an unoccupied and deserted building. Shall we go there, Sir? An operation with our force will be risky. We don't know how he might react. -Two of her friends are also missing. -Yes, Sir. He has abducted them as well. We cannot take a chance. We need a semi-commando operation. I've been out of touch since a very long time. Some things get better with age. -Really? -Yes, Sir. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. This is your retribution. God punishes those who hurt Jerome. But you will resurrect on the third day, as an angel. Students of St. Mary's college, Ernakulam were abducted and confined by Jerome. He was arrested by IG Chandrashekhar, the head of Metro Crime Stopper Cell. The three girls have been rescued. The careless attitude of the city police commissioner is evident. The MCSC took matters into their own hands. To discuss this case, we have with us Advocate Deepthi, a very famous Lawyer and the head of Manthra Institute of Mental Health and Research Center, a well-known psychiatrist, Dr. Jacob Varghese. First, over to Dr. Jacob Varghese. The accused, Jerome, is one of your patients. What's he suffering from? Jerome has been my patient since 12 years. I was working at NIMHANS, Bangalore. Jerome suffers from a strange psychiatric disorder. Like all other cases, the roots of his illness lie in his family history. A mother who is not married. You can imagine his childhood and his teenage years. He nurses hatred and revenge for everyone. Anger which has no particular direction. These girls had insulted him in the past. It would be unjust to treat him as a criminal. Advocate Deepthi, you represent Jerome. What's your opinion about this crime? Manish, I don't consider this as a crime. Jerome's mental state is evident from Dr. Jacob's analysis. According to IPC-84, the actions of a mentally deranged person cannot be considered a crime. And the officer who arrested Jerome... IG Chandrashekhar. We now have IG Chandrashekhar on the phone line. Mr. Chandrashekhar? You've heard what Dr. Jacob and Advocate Deepthi had to say. What is your response to their opinions? She's referring to the accused's mental state and other legal aspects. This is not feasible for the police to consider. Three girls were abducted and imprisoned by a criminal. We rescued those girls. Sheeba's father who suffered a heart attack has recovered after the rescue. This is what is important. The accused's mental state and his punishment has to be decided by the court. This fact is evident. Many criminals escape punishment under the guise of mental illness. Is it unethical to justify it. Crimes need to be curbed, not certified by a doctor. That's all I have to say. Damn you! Susan, you... Such a shame you could do nothing. Ever since I got to know that Jerome was involved, I tried to protect him, Uncle. But it led to Chandrashekhar's intervention. Now everyone knows that he is mentally deranged. Uncle, we have no other option. On these grounds, we can bail him out tomorrow. True. I've been unable to accept my son's mental illness. Reason being, my family, the society, my status and my daughters' future. He is my only son. He's like a younger brother to you. Susan, tell me. Should Chandrashekhar be spared? No. If Peter takes a decision, we have barely any chance. I'm leaving. Are you upset after the interaction with Chandrashekhar? No. Never lie to a doctor, especially to a psychiatrist. Forget that chance encounter. The head of your drama workshop, is the famous drama artist, director and theater activist, Mr. Roshan. People call him Mark. He played the role of Mark Anthony at the London Globe theater. He's the youngest and the first Asian to play that role. I haven't come here to teach you drama. I'm here to learn from you. Over the next two weeks, we will be together to know each other better and to learn the art of drama. Drama is an art form most closely related to life. The truth is, our life is like drama. You are late. Sorry, I was busy with home chores and cooking. Don't you want the money? Mom is here. She gave me the entire fees for the workshop. -So you don't need the money? -I do. I will add your share before paying. Whatever is in excess, I'll return it to mom. No, my dear. Don't do that. Yes, dad. I want to. To learn drama, I need your approval too. You've always encouraged me, dad. You want my blessings? Bless you. Don't hurt mom by returning the money. Use the money to have some pizza with friends. I'm leaving. If Mark Roshan has any doubts, ask him to call me. If I am free, I'll tutor him. You've gone too far, beyond reach Gone, without a goodbye Even though you are away, You are always on my mind Without breaking away Yearning for a reply from you Beautiful one, come Come beside me Beautiful blossom Come back to me You've gone too far, beyond reach Gone, without a goodbye I have wandered in search Through infinite births When finally you belonged to me We merged into one being Like my own shadow always beside me You remained Times moved on I realized salvation in life My friend, your words I hummed as a song of love Why do I need the music of the rains? Beautiful one, come Come beside me Beautiful blossom Come back to me I don't exist If your face isn't etched in my mind Without the sweet-notes of your voice I am no more Why did you leave that day Without a goodbye? Are you unaware of the pain I still bear? The little bird who chattered in fun, Is now silent My heart aches Hearts that parted ways Now silently tremble Beautiful one, come Come beside me Beautiful blossom Come back to me Beautiful blossom Come back to me Beautiful blossom Come back to me The occurrences over the past two days made me think that he was back in form. I was wrong, he's back to square one. Playing chess all by himself, what a pity! Rashid. Come here. What about the maid you promised? I am still on the lookout. Please give me a couple of days. Okay, continue. Too many letters have piled up. All it takes is a letter and a stamp. They write about a bomb being planted inside the World Trade Center. About a neighbor who is trying to break his compound wall. Most of this is just false information. Often difficult to identify the genuine ones. You must, Kishore. You should be able to differentiate between a genuine move and a false move. Do you know how to play chess? I have a vague idea. Never play without thorough knowledge. Both, in life and in Chess. You will lose. I'll pick a letter from this pile. It is addressed to me in red ink. Dear, Chandrashekhar. I have been following you since many years. Honestly, I am a fan of yours. Actually, I used to be a fan of yours. Until about 10 years ago, you were one of the smartest officers in Kerala. I know all about your cases, your intelligence and the single handed operations you have performed. I've noticed what's been happening to you for the past 10 years. When you faced a crisis in your personal life your caliber got affected. You escaped from everything and my admiration for you decreased. But two days ago, when you arrested Jerome you surprised me once again. You have convinced me that you will be yourself, now and forever more. Kerala's smartest and bravest police officer. Now I cannot think of you going back to your state of idleness. I have found a way to keep you going. You need to stop playing chess. I am on the other side. The date and venue for the game is as follows. Venue, Adityapuram. Date, 10th of this month. Let's begin the game, Chandrashekhar. Don't disappoint me. Yours, with admiration. Your trusted friend. Z. What do you think? This is a fake letter, Sir. We should not take this seriously. I smell something fishy. I picked this letter by chance. But, I never expected a player like this. Adityapuram is about 7.5 kilometers from here. -This is a lonely shore area. -Sir. This is one of the least populated areas of this district. The crime rate here is quite less. What precautionary measure can we possibly take here, Sir? -Get in touch with the sub inspector. -Sir. On the 10th, he needs to be alert. We can appoint three men for surveillance. And ask them to report anything unusual. I need coffee. Sir, I told you. I've been roaming around since afternoon. There isn't a decent restaurant around. Only petty tea stalls. Sit. We have no milk. I have some products with me. Please take a look. When you came here asking for a cup of coffee, I knew it. You intended to sell me something. It's closing time. Please don't say that. You must see it. The milk vendor was the first one to see the body. The cops informed us immediately. Is the scene of crime intact? I had instructed them not to disrupt anything. Was she living alone? She had employed three men from Mizoram. It was a new contract. By 5:00 p.m. she had asked them to leave. Since it's off season, there wasn't much to do. Generally, this pub is not open beyond 6:30 p.m. The foreigners who visit the beach are her customers. She did not favor the locals. Mighty expensive too. If you look at the menu you'll be astonished. Any attempt at robbery? No, Sir. The table was not locked. Rupees 8,000 in cash still remain. She used to live nearby. The key to her house is also in the drawer. Check the room, Rashid. Does she have any relatives? She is a widow with no children or relatives. Why didn't you report this incident to me or the assistant commissioner of police? You only expect us to come for the funeral? Madam-- I don't want your explanations as verbal gospel. You can put it in writing and give it to me before noon. A crime committed here, is for us to investigate. Your aggression today has not reached its usual standard. But is still quite unpleasant. This crime has a prelude which you do not know of. A flashback. A letter that I've received. Don't mind me. But you no longer have a role here. My role? No one else can play my part. Everybody is aware of that. Did you have your breakfast? Did you have your breakfast? I'm sure you know that the ADG of Police will be there with me. So, these are the occurrences. Very strange. Isn't it, Chandrashekhar? What is your explanation? The letter I received states that this is a game. The alphabet book found near Alice's body shows "A for apple" struck off and A for Alice written instead. A very strange murder. This is an opening move, Sir. In the letter, he mentions only the date and venue of the game. That means, this will continue. Venue for murder begins with the letter A. Adityapuram. So the next letter will be a venue beginning with the letter B. The victim will also be a person whose name begins with the letter B. Choosing his victims alphabetically like a serial killer. This crime, its total build-up, its character and the rest. Nothing matches the criminal nature of our country. For instance, Auto Shankar of Tamil Nadu and Dantupalaya Krishna of Karanataka committed crude serial killings. But, this... We have to prevent another murder from happening. Let Susan investigate. I will give Susan a report and copy of this letter. I'll hand over the next letter to the commissioner, as soon as it comes. You cannot avoid this case. The killer has personally challenged you. You have to accept that challenge. I'm not interested in this game. Whoever committed the murder wanted me to get into the arena. He chose February 10th for the first murder. It's a landmark day in my personal life. I am not interested in being involved in this game. Once he knows I am not involved, he'll change his strategy. It will become easier for us. Not possible. The case is your responsibility. The future investigation, as well. Let him know that challenging you was the biggest mistake of his life. You mentioned that there is a connection between the murderer and your personal life. What if you were to gain more than you lost? It could be the other way around. I could end up losing more. I shall take up the investigation. He has signed with the letter Z. My name starts with the letter C. The last bill printed on the billing machine reads 6:35 p.m. The coffee maker was switched on when we arrived on the scene. -Sir. -This cup was placed next to it. That shows... the murderer attacked Alice from behind when her back was turned to pour the coffee into the mug. Alice who closes the shop at 6:30 p.m., didn't follow her routine. At 6:35 after the last customer left, Alice had a visitor. A guest who came at the wrong time. She welcomed him. She made coffee for him. Which means Alice knew him well. Must be a regular customer. Sir, your assumptions are quite logical. But... Not assumptions. They are facts. The investigations around here did not reveal anything important. I'm not sure about the relevance of this detail. In this area, a salesman was roaming around that day. He had a suspicious look. That's the general opinion. And after a murder like this, there is no dearth of rumors. Therefore I did not give this salesman much importance. Investigate it, Rashid. Sir, may I voice my thoughts? If the murderer knew Alice well and was a regular guest here there must be a very personal reason for that, isn't it? But why did he send a letter challenging you? The alphabet book left next to the body and the cross marked on her forehead? The alphabet and cross don't match. They are like chalk and cheese. This alphabet book and cross are indicators placed to mislead us. The killer is mentally unstable. I think, Jerome has some connection to this murder. He probably holds a grudge against you. He was released by the court a week ago, for treatment. Manthra Mental Health Center. -Let him stay outside. -Okay, Sir. -Come back quickly, okay. -Yes. I've heard a lot about this place and the doctor here. I hope you heard good things. Doctor, a strange murder took place yesterday at Adityapuram. The victim's name is Alice. I saw it on the news. You were informed beforehand. We assume a stable man usually wouldn't commit such a murder. Jerome, whom we arrested a few days ago is here under your care. Did he go anywhere outside with or without your permission? So this is what you came for. No, Sir. Patients cannot leave without my direct permission. Even visitors have restricted entry here. I am being questioned by the police for the first time. But like you said, there's a letter challenging you with precise planning. My patient has no such capabilities to murder. He has more of an impulsive nature and does what he thinks in that moment. He is the one who pre-planned and kidnapped three girls whom he held a grudge against. He is a criminal. Sorry, a mentally deranged patient. I believe he is quite capable of committing this murder. You can wait inside. I will be with you soon. I came to drop my daughter. Daughter? Why is she here? This is the venue for her drama workshop. Students interact with selective patients who are docile. It's part of their course. I am leaving, Jacob. Don't forget the party at the Taj this evening. I'll pick you up in the evening. We'll take your leave. I want a copy of Jerome's medical records. Wait! Sir, my dad is here. May I please go meet him? Hey! What brings you here? Nothing special. God! Hope it isn't for treatment. Sure, for treatment indeed. The patient is your mother. Do you know the doctor here? Jacob Uncle? He is mom's close friend and comes home often. I am truly enjoying it, dad. Dad, look. Daksha always talks about you. She has an interest and we must stand by her. Really? Where are you from? I'm from Wyanad. I have very few relatives. At 18, I landed in London on a scholarship for theater training. I have been touring with drama troupes. With a pet name like Mark Roshan. Why did you pick this place for a training session? Dr. Jacob is a lover of theater. When he worked for NIMHANS at Bangalore I conducted a camp for patients there. Doctor wanted one to be held here as well. -I'll take your leave. -Bye, Sir. If Roshan has doubts, just give me a call. See you, my dear. Jerome. What were you looking at? He was here. -Who? -Don't you know? Father, I've killed. I did it. I called you over to tell you this. The intelligence department has received this information. There isn't any mystery in the case you are investigating. Alice had connections with a drug racket. Her fall-out with them was the motive behind her killing. That gang has fixed up a deal at the old civil station tonight. Your boss may not like my direct involvement. If I don't share the information, it's unethical. Susan? Sir, the second letter is here. My dearest Chandrashekhar. The first game is over. For your careful consideration, the multiple clues I've left at the scene of the crime, reveal something about my identity. I'm sure you've registered all of that. Your doubts about my mental health have amused me. I might be mentally deranged. But, there is a method to my insanity. Let's begin the next game. Date, February 23rd. The Venue is Binanipuram. The reward for sin is death. With love and respect. February 23rd, Binanipuram. Kishore, I'll get in touch with the local police. This entire area will be under our observation. You are like a breeze Searching for a place for itself The unending rain within me You are the substance Of illusion on this earth The live coals that burn Within the heart As wings droop in tiredness I wonder what's in store for me I wonder Are you the lightning streak Of unending love? Who are you? Wonder who you are Who are you? Wonder who you are Who are you? As I wander in search You rush away I sing my song You too, like the darkness Of the wandering shadows Receding, like the deepest of waves Are you the twinge in my eye? Are you the evening dusk? Unaware I wonder what is within you now I wonder what Are you a fragment of the soul That lay shattered? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? As I wander in search You rush away I sing my song Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Where? Beena. He has committed a blunder in this game, Rashid. He has left a clue showing us exactly who he is. In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit. God, is it fair what you are ordering me to do? Son of mankind, is your judgment sincere? No, you are filling your hearts with evil. Your hands do injustice on earth. Cruel ones go the wrong way right from the womb. I don't want to know what you are doing. Whatever done so far, has been ineffective. We are very confused here, Sir. Two women were killed. One was a 65 year old widow. Another, an unmarried girl aged 24. One was a mere coffee pub owner. The other, a renowned singer. There is no common factor that links them together. Normal serial killing has a pattern to the victims' selection. If so, there should have been some religious text or a sermon note left near the dead body. We have to know more about Beena. A girl like Beena... She left the venue with him in her car and ventured out during the wee hours. That shows they were very intimate. Details about Beena's personal life will help us trace this man. Susan. Isn't Jerome your cousin? Isn't he the illegitimate son of your uncle? Sir... Please note this, Sir. Her uncle, Peter has a questionable character. He has good connections to the Karnataka mafia. What are you implying, Sir? Getting secret information that the mafia has conspired these murders. And to pass it on to Kishore as a valuable tip. We followed up on that, with a big time gangster style attack. Go tell your uncle that if he's planning anything again ask your parish priest to set aside free time. Your uncle may be in need of consecration. Which one of you is Adarsh? What is the matter? I'm Kishore. I'm a cop. Aren't you the leader of the band? I wanted to know a couple of things. Quickly. Had Beena Thomson decided to leave your band? She intended to. I had requested her to not be hasty. Then? Then I told her not to let it become a rumor. That would affect the band negatively. I doubt that, Adarsh. You were quite harsh to her. You told her that there was no way she could leave the band. Sir... Were you in love with her? Let's go. Where, Sir? -Let's go. -Wait a minute. Get moving! Come on. We could get a lot of information from him. That's why I brought him here. Beena's father has revealed that she was intimate with someone. She had decided to marry him. If that was the case, she must have been with him that night. Girls these days are not serious about marriage. They do have casual flings. It could be something like that. I don't think so, Rashid. Beena was very secretive about her affair. Her meeting with her lover must have been a secret too. That night, her lover was with her. This guy can give us a few clues about the identity of her lover. He was in love with Beena. You seem to know a great deal about the Night-riders. How is that? My friend Bindya is a huge fan of this troupe. She had attended Beena's last program. Your friend seems nice. She is a witness at all the crucial places. What else did your friend say? I've recorded everything she said. You started this troupe with Beena and two other friends five years ago. Beena decided to quit the troupe four months ago. I don't know the exact reason. I'll try asking him aggressively. -Would you like that? -No, Sir. Beena... was in love with someone. After getting married, she had planned to settle abroad. Who was he? I don't know, Sir. Trust me. She didn't love you. Weren't you sad about that? Is that true, Adarsh? I tried to convince her. But she used to avoid me. Not only me... she avoided the others too. She used to flirt with many boys. She made them feel special. But never got involved. But finally, she got hooked to someone. Yes, Sir. But she never revealed who it was. All she said was that she would be marrying next month. The night Beena was murdered the lyrics of the song she last sang were changed. Your friend has revealed this in the recording. You did not think it was significant. So it did not register in your mind. Tell me. Who changed the lyrics of that popular number? It was Beena. I don't know why she did that. We fought over it. There was a salesman with Beena. Yes, Sir. -Rashid. -Sir? The day Alice was killed, there was a salesman there. Yes, Sir. Finally, a link. Why do you buy such things from random guys? They seem to be fake products. Beena! I need to ask you something. With whose permission did you change the lyrics to my song? No one. It is atrocious to change the lyrics of a huge hit number. My music made it a big hit. Not your lyrics. Whoever heard the lines that I rewrote, said it was better than the original. Beena, you can't just do as you please. I can. I'm continuing with the band because you begged me to. Don't forget that. Your unrequited love and frustration has started to bore me. Beena's personal belongings found from her car are all here. Yes. No photos or messages. There's just one video clipping. As Beena tries to shoot someone, he covers the lens with his hand. Reading law books all the time? I don't like such books. My daughter would prefer these books. She's into literature, acting and music. Just like her father. You have a certain pride in saying that. Really? May be. What happened? I collided with that man and these books fell down. Alright. We've got an important breakthrough in this case. We had found no link between Alice and Beena's murder. But the truth is, that these murders are inter linked. The murders have a clear intention. This is the coffee mug used in the pub run by Alice. In Beena's video recording the letters A and L were outside its frame. That means this video was shot in Alice's coffee pub. So Beena and her secret lover used to meet at Alice's coffee pub. A time when everyone had left the pub. This visual was shot at night with only Alice as the witness. To the smell of coffee I want to walk with you by the sea These are the lyrics which Beena changed. Look at the words I've marked. A word that strikes a chord and brings an image to our mind. What is the title of that famous book? When Beena wrote about love in her song, which is reflected in her lyrics she unconsciously set it against Alice's coffee pub. Not only Beena but Alice, the witness to their affair, was also killed. Beena had a secret lover. Beena's call list reflects maximum calls in the past two months from a Bangalore based pre-paid number which availed roaming facility in Kerala. The number belonged to a taxi driver. There have been calls made to Alice's number as well. Now that number is switched off. Its use is over. He has discarded that number. There are loose ends to this case. What about the presence of a salesman in both the murders? He hasn't been selling a lot. He sells various brands and a collection of different products. The company he works for is called Mirage. The details are in here. This is a fake company and a fake address. There is no doubt that this man is a very important link in these murders. The name Mirage itself means imaginary. This salesman is there to mislead us. Just like the alphabetical order followed by the serial killer. -But, Sir... -Yes? Why would anyone want to do such things? One can commit these crimes in a simple manner. There is fiction, exaggeration and mystery. And the strange mental mindset, like that of a child linking the murders to the names in an alphabet book. A challenge thrown at me, with a vested interest. Please note. Now I know a lot about the killer and his character. I am now making a move beyond his calculations. This sort of an evening break is unusual for me. But you insisted that the office is full of clients. Aren't you bored with all the legalities? Do you get bored of the mental problems of your patients? I give up. I cannot win an argument with you. I have been wanting to ask you this on many occasions, but decided against it. Both of us have an uneasy past. You, with a broken marriage. And me, with unrequited love. We understand each other very well. Do you think we could take this relationship a bit further? You are right, Jacob. Let it not go beyond that. True. But I haven't been able to convince myself even after all these years. This is a confession. An open talk with a good psychiatrist. If there is ever a man in my life... he is the one. Forget it. I feel relieved after this talk. We call it talking-cure. There is nothing as beautiful as losing in love and in a revolution. Yes. Yes. Dad, you are ignoring me these days. I called you twice. You said you'd call me back, but never did. I was busy, my dear. Have you started taking your job seriously? You minx! Don't forget to attend the play on Wednesday. Listen, I met an astrologer. He says we are all going through a bad phase. So you've got to wear this. It will keep you off the evil eye. Dad, you know what? Do as I say. This has to be worn by your mom. If she objects, you need to convince her. Don't tell her that I gave it. Lie to her if you need to. It's not good to lie. True, but in certain circumstances if your father asks you to, it's okay. Will it happen soon? What? Will I be able to live with the both of you? Finish the cake and get going. I'll be back in a minute. Rashid. Daksha's transmitter is active. Deepthi's transmitter will be activated by tonight. We have to watch both their movements. They have to be under our protection. Dear, Chandrashekhar. The score is two-zero. I can very well imagine your mental state right now. A strong sense of defeat has enveloped you. Waiting for you has been a memorable experience. The fires of hell never die out. They continuously burn within the minds of sinners. Date, march the first. Venue, Cheriyavathil Fort. Affectionately, Z. The first of march? Isn't that today? What's the Venue? Cheriyavathilkota. Sir, that's where you live. The third murder has occurred. One Mrs. Chandrika Narayanan. -Mrs. Chandrika Narayanan? -Yes. The MD of Fortune group. Her office is close by. C for Chandrika. This is Madam's guest house. She uses this space to relax. Isn't there security here? There is a man but he's been on leave, since the past two days. Was there any specific reason for her to be here today? She said she was expecting a visitor. Did she say who the visitor was? No. She never gave me any details. Did a salesman come here today? A door to door seller of cosmetics? Yes, Sir. There are many visuals here. Can you identify the salesman? Last year, Fortune group had a turnover of 57 crores. She and her husband have been separated for 12 years. She has a son who's in the states. We have dropped him an email. Sir, we have identified the man. We will catch him, Sir. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but the investigation has not had any results. You have a grudge because I arrested your cousin Jerome. He is not related to this case. Sir, today's letter did not come to the office. It was delivered to my house. The murder took place before I read that letter. He has sent the letter to my house with the sole intention of committing the murder before I read his letter. The killer wanted me to know about the murder, after it occurred. As far as he is concerned, this was his most important murder. He wanted this murder to take place by all means. I know why he challenged me to this game. I know who he is going to kill next. The date he selected for his first murder was February 10th. Like I said, that was a bad day for me. That was the day my divorce was granted. It was the beginning of professional clashes between me and Deepthi. A death which took place in this city 10 years ago, is what led to my divorce. Superficially, it looked like suicide. But I was sure, it was a murder. The chief person I suspected then, is the victim, Chandrika. Paul Mathew, was one of the richest NRIs. He died of poisoning. I doubted that it was a murder. Paul went abroad when he was very young. He returned a very rich man. He had no close relatives. He was a bachelor. He was deeply involved with Chandrika. He helped her financially. But when he started asking back his money, they started drifting apart. She had been with him a few minutes before he died. I had many clear clues indicating that Chandrika could be his murderer. I shared this with Deepthi. These discussions were quite common between us. The very next day, I called Chandrika for questioning. She responded as if she knew every question beforehand. I could not pin her to the murder with the details and alibi she provided. I realized this and it dawned on me that Deepthi was her lawyer. I lost control when I came to know that the professional details I'd discussed were used by her for her benefit. Shall I get tea for you? You rather not live with me if you're going to betray me. Father, what should I do? The police will find you. They will arrest you, then comes the trial and punishment. All of that is a normal routine. You need to follow God's way. Your sins will be taken up by Him. I know, Father. I know He awaits me. I'll tell you where you have to go. There is one more job to be done. Death of a sinner. Take a left from the next junction. I need to talk to you. What can I do for you? Tell me the truth. Right from the start, I knew that the murderer was trying to communicate something to me. He had a reason to involve me. There was a close bond between Alice and Beena. I need to know about the connection between them and Chandrika. Were Beena, Alice and Chandrika involved in Paul Matthew's murder? Your answer will clarify the mystery of these murders. It was quite unexpected that my senior Vaidyanathan asked me to assist Chandrika that day. He convinced me that she was innocent. He told me that she was a prime suspect in Paul Matthew's murder. Through you, I knew beforehand what the police was suspecting. I got to know about the questions that they intended to ask her. So I was able to help her easily. It was an attempt by me, a novice, to establish myself. It took me years to understand that I had betrayed you. After handling two more of her cases, I got to know her better. I got an idea of how Paul Matthew was killed. Alice, who ran a small textile shop in Fort Kochi was an accomplice of Chandrika. A pimp. They exploited Paul's weakness. Chandrika and Alice had arranged Beena for Paul. Beena was 16 years old at that time. Later, the three of them ran a sex racket. They also blackmailed their clients. This is proof of your errant ways. You must be aware of it. You know Beena is a minor, right? These photos, videos and her statement can ruin your life. But none of that will happen. She follows my instructions. Consider the money you gave me as a price to secure your future. I was under the impression that you loved me. Love and marriage are not on the cards for me. They are just part of the game. I always knew you were a harlot! Fifteen years ago from a Theekoyi Christian boy who had lost everything in the floods... to a globetrotting businessman, my transition took me through many dangers. I don't need to worry about my future by paying 1,68,00,000 rupees as security to a pimp like you. You, that minor girl, as well as Alice have pleasured me enough. For that, I could let go of 18,00,000 rupees. I want the balance of 1,50,00,000 rupees without any losses. Otherwise, all of you will be doomed. I've finished quite a few debts that way, with my bare hands. I knew I had only one way out.I had to kill Paul. Alice and Beena encouraged me. I buried my differences and got back into his good books. It was a murder that seemed like suicide. I had no choice. My dear lawyer, because of me... Sorry. Alice, Beena and myself. We are partners in everything. Because of us, your life turned into a mess. When I discovered the truth, the first thing I wanted to do was to come and confess my mistakes. It was three years since we had separated. I don't know whether it was false pride or ego that prevented me from doing so. Moreover, I was scared as to how Chandrika would react to that. Ego, pride and fear. These are mere justifications to console yourself for the life you lost. But our daughter had to forgo the security of a family. Have you ever thought about that? Let's forget the past. This is not the time to discuss that. The three women responsible for Paul Mathew's death have been killed. If it was a case of revenge, Paul must have had someone closely related to him, to do so. Is there a person like that? Indeed there is. Someone who has waited patiently for ten years, to avenge his death. The names of the victims coincided with the alphabets A, B, C and D. The one who created a myth of a serial killer as well as challenged me with letters. He is no ordinary killer. He is a strange person who considers killing as a game. I know the climax even though you haven't told me yet. The woman who saved Paul Mathew's killer also has to die. I'm going to die, isn't it? D for Deepthi. No, nothing like that will happen. I... No... I mean, all of us are here. Is this what will save me? When did you start believing in these things? When I started facing defeat. Don't you want to meet your daughter? No, I shall meet her tomorrow at her school play. Let's get in touch with the cyber cell to trace this email. All Glories to Lord Vishnu He who has everything in His control I bow to Lord Vishnu who is ever peaceful Who reclines on the great serpent bed From His navel springs the Lotus Of the supreme creative power Who is all-pervading as the sky Who is dark like the clouds And has a beautiful form Lord of Lakshmi, the lotus-eyed one Who the yogis are able to perceive Through meditation That universal consciousness which Illumines and sustains the three worlds I bow to Lord Vishnu, Lord of all The mighty enemy of demons The supreme being What is it that you want? I don't want your pity. I do not believe in human beings and their laws. I believe only in God's laws and His justice. Listen to what I have to say. I will not obey you, Chandrashekhar. Father Alexander? Yes, Father Alexander of St. Thomas church. Were you the one who killed Alice, Beena and Chandrika? Yes. I did. I don't remember anything. Father said it was me who killed them. It was me. Wasn't it Father who asked you to visit these women as a salesman? After they were killed, he also said that it was you who killed them. I don't remember anything Father says. God's will happens through me. The dead are sinners. Lust and sinful desires are their sins. There is one more job to do. Father has entrusted me with it. Your ex-wife. She who gave up her family in her greed for riches and fame, she shall be punished today. Do you know who she hangs out with? He, who stamped me a lunatic. Me, within whom God's will resides. I was there. You were betrayed. The woman who continues to cheat you, God is about to punish her. Victor. Jesus. Please move aside. Move aside. Move away. Step aside. Sir, I know him. He was a patient of yours while you were at NIMHANS. Victor Rosetti. He has been missing since February 10th, 2011. He was found missing from the hospital. True. Let me tell you though. We had identified his photograph. We found out from our investigations that he had gone missing on February 10th, 2011. His medical records state that he had severe schizophrenia. He had a strong fixation towards faith, religion, God and religious symbols. A church representative inside the holy premises. Someone who thinks he's God's accomplice. Instruction from such a person are bound to influence Victor's subconscious mind. He'll accept and obey that person. Am I right? The murdered singer, Beena's lover used to call her from a Bangalore prepaid number. Alice too had received calls from this number. It was clear that the killer had connections to Bangalore. NIMHANS. National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Science is located at Bangalore. You resigned from NIMHANS. Next day, Victor went missing. You were fully aware of Victor's illness. You controlled his subconscious mind and created the myth of a serial killer. I mean, the killer we are looking for, is you. I know why you did this. Wait a minute. Did you see Dakshayini? No, auntie. Mark Roshan. Your old passport clearly outlines your identity. Mathew Varghese's son, Roshan Mathew of Naripatta house in Theekoyi. The one and only brother of Paul Mathew who was killed eleven years ago. The end game between us was a drama engineered by you. I countered that with a strategy. Gambit. A trick where you sacrifice a few expensive pieces. And pull the carpet from under the opponent's feet. Gambit number one, I got Dr. Jacob arrested. My trick to convince you that I had made a total blunder. At the end of your play, I got the lights switched off. I sent my daughter away with Rashid. It's me, Rashid Uncle. My intention was to get Deepthi here in search of her daughter. It was a huge risk for me. Everything had gone according to your plan. You were in a very violent mood, and I threw Deepthi in front of you. These murders had a Bangalore connection, a prepaid number. When Victor's identity was established, you assumed that I'd suspect Dr. Jacob. But remember what you told me once? When doctor was at NIMHANS, I conducted a camp for the patients there. Victor had taken part in the workshop you once conducted at NIMHANS. Apart from Dr. Jacob, you knew Victor well, Mark Roshan. You are passionate about dramatics. You are intrigued by a killer's mind. -Roshan, your hometown? -I belong to Wyanad. Your statement that you belonged to Wyanad which was a childish lie, strengthened my suspicions. It was confirmed that you were Paul Mathew's brother. Paul Mathew was my brother. No... he was like my father. We were the only ones for each other. And then, Chandrika got involved with Paul. The day he realized her true character,he called me. I was in London at that time. This is me. I told you about a wedding proposal. But that's not going to happen. She is a fraud. Then, I got to know that he was dead. I was a helpless teenager who had lost everything. Three years later, I came to India. That was my only purpose every time I visited India. I realized that a total of three women were responsible for his death. All the three were rescued by a fourth. I got intrigued by the fact that their names fell in the alphabetical order. I kept rewriting the script.That's when Victor landed on the scene. I turned him into a serial killer,one who kills in alphabetical order. The first part of my screenplay was me getting intimate with Beena. I insisted that she be secretive of our affair. She believed that I would marry her.Just like my brother believed Chandrika. I chose Alice's coffee pub to meet up with her. I also developed a close friendship with Chandrika. She was conducting a cultural forum. Victor, influenced by me, opted out from NIMHANS in Bangalore. I was Father Alexander to Victor. I gave him a job as a salesman of a fictitious company called Mirage. I sent him to Alice, Beena and Chandrika. After that, it was the moment I was waiting for. I killed Alice first. When I told her I was Paul's brother even in those moments of death,she was stunned. After the program, I went for a drive with Beena. I had a gift for her, a red scarf. I choked her, resulting in her death. Finally, it was Chandrika. I convinced Victor that he had killed all of them. Finally, I entrusted him with the job of killing Deepthi knowing that he would fail. I was framing Victor as a serial killer who confesses to the crimes. And then, I was to make the final kill. Deepthi. When I found out the truth about my brother's death I wanted you to star as the main character in my screenplay. Just for the kick of facing an intelligent opponent. After writing the drama and directing it I wanted my super heroic cameo at the climax. But I was defeated. But every story has a twist. THREE MONTHS LATER. SUMMER VACATION. Crime rates lessen in Kochi. MCSC, effective results. Really?
