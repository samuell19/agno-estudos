Oh much better. Alright we did it. Like proper pro's. Yeah! Tomorrow you lot will be famous. Every newspaper in town will be talking about how seven nobodies ripped off the most protected bank in the whole of the United fucking Kingdom. Most protected my arse. Something isn't right here. What do you mean? Where's the fuck who's supposed to open those babes? Hmm that's a good question. Hey you. Wake up you dosey cunt! We're back. What's that shit? I've seen this before. It creates  interference. My brother used to work for government, he eventually sold couple of those. Good profit on the side you know. Nobody will notice when there's a war going on. What's is that smell? That's the smell of freedom baby. Honey we're home. Hey Denny? Come on man. What kind of name is that Denny. I used to know a bloke whose dog was called Denny. Real mother fucker. Who? The guy or the dog? Both. Right pair of cunts! Hey Denny for the last time. Answer me when I m talking to you. Oy what you doing. Put that thing away. Go and check. Is the mother fucker sleeping or what? Hey you fucking nerd, say something. Come on man we did it. We got the money man. We're fucking rich now. Hell yeah. Lets crack these babies open and get the fuck out of here. I don't know about you but I got a plane waiting for me and I don't want to be fucking late. Lets  get a move on shall we. Fucking hell. That is not good. Is he dead? Looks like someone got shot here. No Shit. I can see that. Fuck! Who shot him? You tell me Einstein? Hey if Einstein was such a genius, how comes whenever someone calls you that... Just shut the fuck up all of you. You go check outside. Why me? There is nobody there. We just been there. Fuck you. Fucking bitch. What are you doing? Hey! What's the... Are you fucking stupid or something? What's the fucking point! How we going to open them now? We just got to find another guy. I don't know he's right. What is the point? Look I don't know, but if you do that again I'll fucking shoot you. Don't you fucking tell me what to do. I'm going to tell you what to do because you're going to fuck things up otherwise. Do you have any idea what will happen if that mechanism gets damaged? Yes I do as it goes. Asshole... There's two hot chicks and they said they want to go and have fun. Oh yeah? I do like a foursome. Did he shoot himself or what? Yeh he probably just got over excited. There's only one way to find out. Were not touching anything in here until we know what's going on. He's right, something isn't right  here. For fuck sake you bunch of pussies. You want to know what's going on. I'll tell you what's fucking going on. The only bloke who can open these fucking cases is dead. If we don't get out the country by  tomorrow fucking morning well all going to get arrested but don't worry about it cause you won't go to prison. Oh no because the cunts we just fucking robbed will most likely kill us before we fucking get in there. That's what's going on. So! What are we going to do here? We can stand like a bunch of fucking lemons or get a fucking move on. You know you have a little vein. That makes no sense. It makes perfect sense. You fucking bum boy Denny had a deal on the side didn t he. They shot him and left without the money. What's  the point? Alright well first of all calm the fuck down. I don't know what the point is. Maybe they didn't know we were coming. Maybe he didn't tell them. Maybe there waiting for us... ...or maybe one of us is behind this. A long as I have bullets in my gun, I aren't afraid of shit. As long as where together we stick to the plan. What plan. The plan fell apart when we left the fucking bank. We'll just find another guy. Or... we press the button on that fucking keyboard. Look... that looks like it plugs into the fucking case. Fuck that shit. I'm not leaving without my cut. I mean... How do you all know you aren't going to make off my cut. Good fucking point same here. We have to do it here and now. There's nothing we can do now ok. We got to go. Tell me something. When you start giving the orders and we got to fucking listen to them? Hey? Since you fucked up out there. I fucked up. Six is dead because of you don't you forget it and this, this bloods on your fucking  hands. Six died because of an accident. What accident? You shot him. Just like you shot that little kid. What was his name? David.. That's  right. Why did you fucking do that? How do you know that? How old was he 9? Shut up man. Big fucking man shooting a nine year old! Shut the fuck up. We are professionals. Lets act like ones. Lets fucking finish what we have started and get the hell out of here shall we. Because I surely don't want to see your ugly faces ever again. Go on then! Do it again and I will shoot you both. More money for me. Get off me. Know something you're right. You don't have to follow my orders. You're not my friend, I  don't know you. I'm here because of a job. But if you do that again I'll fucking shoot. Roger that cap. Fucking nob head. Back to nosiness. We got to figure out some deep shit here. Did any of you know him? Yeh I saw him once on prep day. He was at the prep? I didn't see him. At the diner. Yeah shit your right I remember him. He was shouting at the waitress. The guy who bought coffee. Yep. That's the one. But why was he sitting at a different table. I don't know. Let me tell you something. The only cunt who can open these cases is dead, and unless someone knows how to use that fucking thing... ...we're fucked. Can we open it manually? No. Good luck with that. I mean we don't have the proper tools. I mean we try to open that it will burn fast. All you'll find  inside is ash. Shit. The only way to unlock it is have the system send a signal. What kind of signal? A message. Electronic key. How the fuck do I know. That's what they said at prep. You was really paying attention at prep weren't you. Yeah, I was. Because some of us are actually professionals here. It says stand by, stand by for what? Okay listen, listen! What if he set everything up already? What if we just have to plug it in and press the button? Huh? That makes perfect sense. I just come down here, set everything up and then shoot myself. That is a great plan. Fuck you at least I'm trying to help. I'm on her side. That's not helping. Wow! Jesus! Two? Course. Guys don't shoot. Thank fuck I thought you guys left without me already. Where were you? That fucking cop shot me and was chased for two miles. Where did you think I was? We thought you was dead. Let me see. What you doing? He said he was shot. I want to make sure. You're a bunch of twats you know that. Arrrgghhh! I think he's telling the truth. Prick. He chased me five blocks. I had to cut him loose. Did you? Did I what? Did you get him loose? Yeah. I think so. That's your answer is it? I don't know, okay. Listen to me, this is very important. Could he have followed you down here? Look you know we can not stay here any longer if he did right? Yes. Yes, I know ok. I lost him. I'm sure of it. That fat pig fell down fell down and you guys know he wasn't getting back up. Well It must be your lucky fucking day then. Where's Six? He could not make it. The money? It's all here. Alright happy days. What are you guys waiting for? Let's  get the fuck out of here. I could do with a doctor right now as well. What? It's a little bit more complicated that. What you talking about? We have a problem here. We can't open the fuckers. Is he dead? Pretty much yeh. You shot him? No. Why would we shoot him? We need him. Who shot him then? We don't know. What do you mean you don't know? That's right. Somebody has been here before us. Well who? I think your 20 questions are up. Who else knows about this place? No one except us. Must be somebody else. Who else then? It can't be him. And why's that? Because he never been down here. Six? He died I saw it with my own eyes. Then it must be one of us. Quiet. Who's this? Danny? Who are you? It's One. One? Why do you have his phone? Where is Danny? He can't talk right now. I need to talk to him. He's dead. You killed him? No. Why would we kill him. Look whoever you're, we  have the money. You're late. Thank you. Good luck. He hung up. Guys... That's not good. What did you do? What the hell? Beethoven, good choice. Just what we fucking need. This isn't normal is it. What the fuck?! Hello, friends! Congratulations on completing the first part of the job. As you can see, around you are five motion sensors that form a circle. And you have just activated them. Device on each one of you wrists is not just a watch. It's also a bomb, charged with liquid PETN. It is one of the most powerful explosive  materials known, In short, it will blow you in pieces. So, when you exit the circle, colour on your watch will change from green to a red and it will blow up. Try to remove it, sensor on the back will trigger detonator and it will blow up. Gentlemen, lady, seat back, relax, and enjoy the show. Can anybody tell me please, what the fuck is going on here? Huh colour me impressed. This is quite the plan. Its got to be a joke right? I mean... ...because deep  inside my I'm  laughing out loud. Guys, this thing is solid. Didn't you hear what he said? If  you remove it, it blows up. Really? Why the fuck are you still alive? That's a good point. Maybe  it's broken. Come on guys! Do you really think  there's a bomb inside this watch? See? Huh and I almost believed it. Fuck. No way. Fuck! Not convinced yet? Fuck you. So what are we going to do now? Here's an idea. Why don't we try  knocking One of those things down? No lasers no perimeter, right? No Einstein. No lasers, no head. Guys. I can't stay here and wait for my ass busted. We're in this together and will get out of this together. No one is getting left behind. I got Two kids at home. There waiting for me before they go to bed. They think I'm going to go and buy them presents. Twin girls, 4. Hey. Listen. We still have time alright. We will get out of here and you'll be there for them ok. I have a fucking bomb on my wrist that doesn't work. How fucked up is that? Don't do it man. I guess you're right. Don't do it. What the fuck man! Why would you do  that? He's not going anywhere. Nice shot. I wish you would do something stupid. Gun? I don't have a gun. You don't have a gun? What you fucking deaf or something. I don ????t have a gun. Man cut the shit finally and give him your gun. Look... I must have dropped it when run out the fucking bank I don't know. It fell on the floor. I  aint got no fucking gun anymore. Hes such a terrible liar isn't he. Just give me the fucking gun. Wow. What the fuck you doing? Just so you all know I could shoot you all fucking right here and now. Are you that fast? Fast enough for you love. Give me the gun. Oh yeh what you going to do? Or I will blow you brains out. How about that? Why didn't you say so in the first place. I was only fucking about with you. Shits and giggles. Fuck that hurt. You know how much these teeth cost? Shut the fuck up! God you're a piece of shit. Yeh that's how my mother used to call me. She was a lovely fucking lady but... ...she used to go nuts. When she was on the blob she was fucking lethal. What are you doing? Don't shit yourself I'm just having a look alright. Relax. How long are we supposed to be here? I guess until it's over. This place is like a locked fucking door in it. And we aint got no key. It's a trap don't you see that. Shut up. All you do is talk shit. Fuck head has a point. Thanks. Call me fuck head again and I will take your fucking head off.. Im sorry? Fuck head? I warned you didn't I! Enough what the fuck is wrong with you. Take it easy come on. Keep your jokes to your fucking self. It's not a trap. Oh yeh go on then. Fuck off. Bunch of fucking losers. Look who's fucking talking. You're the cunt who got us locked in here in the first fucking place. How we going to get out now hey fucking genius? Yeh sorry about that. Wait a sec... If there is a button to arm it there must be a button to disarm it. Right? Let me try something. Hey. What are you doing? Just hold on a minute. Whoever did this really knew what they are doing. It's encrypted. What's that supposed to mean? Means we can't get through it. Great. Don't waste your time. Things just keep getting better and better every fucking minute. If we don't get out of here by sunset we are going to be busted. Wait. What? What do you mean by that? Yeh, please elaborate. Those cases. They have a GPS tracker in them. For now the signal being blocked but sooner or later they will be able to boost the signal and find us. Oh that's great fucking news in it. Which means we got to do something and get the fuck out. And, why you didn't tell us anything before may I ask? Because we were not supposed to stay here this long, remember? Oh but you just assumed that, right? No, I know that for sure. Because the guy I bought the data from is going to do that to avoid suspicion on his end. Look he's  the only one who has access that information and if something goes wrong lets say I don't know  a robbery, he is going to be first on the list. Unless he does his job and tracks those cases. That's right. I don't normally panic. But this  shit really keeps pushing on my brain! Ltd! Don't you fucking lose it girl. Fuck you. You'll be lucky I would snap you in half. He mustn't be too far away. What makes you think that. Because he must be watching us. He know that sooner or later police will track us down and he  won't let them take the  money. But you have to admit it is a great plan. Fuck this shit, I'm getting out of here. And how are you going to do that? Do it. Don't be stupid. Stupid. I'll still have one hand to grab the money with and you cunts you aint got no guns no more. Yen it's about forty feet to the exit right? You will die before you even make it to the  cases. In  fact, I don't even think you will make it half way. Does anybody have any other ideas? That doesn't  involve shooting or cutting somebody into pieces? Pussy. I mean don't get me wrong I don't really care what happens to any of you. Just more money for me, Very sweet of you. Especially you and you, and you. You know, I regret that I threw that gun away. Would love now to press that trigger and blow your both brains out of your stupid fucking heads. Go ahead. Hit me. You aint fucking worth it. Oh come on. That's no fun. Yeh, I thought I was the crazy one here. You're not crazy. You're  just a fuck head. What the fuck is wrong with you two!? Look Enough. Calm the fuck down. All of you. You wanna die? Just step out. What are you going to do? I don't know. I don't trust either of them. You got any ideas? There's something about... Hey! Fucking cunt. You call me again and I will fucking kill you I told you. You wanna kill each other, fine! Just go ahead and kill yourselves. I'm not going to get involved  next time. How high is the ceiling? What difference does that make? He said we could not leave the circle, but he did never say we could not go up. It's got to be at least thirty feet. Maybe even more. I know. But it could be our way out of here? What you going to do hey. Call out the fire brigade? As if you can borrow a fucking ladder? Why the fuck do you have to say shit all the time? Shut the fuck up. We need a rope. At least somebody here's trying to figure out what to do next. Oh Yeah? By climbing an invisible fucking ladder? We could use a rope. Give me a second. Let's  say you manage to get up there. What are you going to do next? Call out for help? What you going to call? Excuse me we are combustible thieving cunts in need of assistance. Please help us. You prick! Does that make sense to you. Hmmm... That's right. We  can't  attract attention especially as we  can't  leave. We can get a better visual. A visual really. Hey enough shut up now. We could try and figure out another way out of here. Wait a second. Can it be connected to the computer? Seems like its connected to something. So... what would happen if we break it? Break it. You want to break the thing that controls the bomb that's strapped to your hand. There's a chance we could disarm it. It is a detonator. Yeh its worth a fucking try. Calm the fuck down. But? Tell him about the but. But there's also a chance it could detonate it. You know, like red and blue in films. Put them together in the wrong way and, boom. Boom? No fucking booming here! Let's vote o.k. It can be our way out. Nobody is fucking voting! I don't know man. Look man. We can stay here and be arrested by the end of the day, or we can take a little risk and hopefully get the fuck out. You know my vote. Oh here he fucking goes. No fucking way! Hell yeah. So how do we do it? Just push it down I guess? I can't let you fucking do that. Very sorry. Now move. Put it down. Where the fuck did you get that? Backup. In case pricks like you start fucking about. So what are you going to do now. Are you going to stand like this for the rest of the day? Yeah. I will if I have to. Ah! Fuck! Ah fuck. Stay the fuck down! What the fuck man. We're fucking robbers not murderers. Fuck! You'll be fine. You're having a good time aren't you? Fuck you. Ah that's good. You guys have got this all wrong "aint" you. You got to look at the positive side. Whats the positive side? Four of us are dead. Yeah so. Shit happens. You're a sick piece of shit. Don't talk to him. He just wants to  provoke you. I aint trying to provoke anybody. I fucking love it here mate. I wish I would known the kind of person you were before. I would  have shot you on the street. That's fucking charming that is. I thought we was friends. Friends? Oh I don't think so. Yeah. I was going to invite you to my fucking villa in Spain. Now as there less of us to go around. More fucking money. You can grab it you know. Yeh what do you fucking want. I need to make sure you don't have anything else on you. Get your fucking hands off me you cunt. Stand fucking still. Go on then you cunt. Go on. Have a look. Have a feel. Get your kicks. You got me didn't you, you cunt. You got me what can I say. For fuck sake. Fucking commandos. Oy I want that back. That's got sentimental value. That's a present. I wonder what else he has. I aint got nothing. Well you know If he says nothing he definitely means he has something. Stupid cunts. Bit of a risk to believe you though hey. Hey? Told you I got nothing. So? What's the fucking plan hey? I don't think there is a plan. The plan fell apart as soon as we got down here. We get here find Denny dead and now four of us are dead... Why is it so fucking hot in here? Do you think they are watching us? I don't know. I mean, a little bit of air  shouldn't be to much of a problem should it? What does that mean? Depends on how hot it can it get. How hot can it get? Let's find out shall we. Great talking to you. Look we're wasting our time talking to him. See the good news is you won't die today. No it will take four days for your guts to dry out. We start drinking each other's piss we might even last out the week. You like that wouldn't you. Golden  shower in the north and fucking south. See without water your minds ability to think will be drastically reduced and you wont be able to operate effectively. Could you shut the fuck up. Yeh shut the fuck up. Just saying, someone has to try and stay positive here. Somebody wanted us to be here. Right here. Bullshit. Is it? Can we can we switch it off? There must be a switch somewhere. There always is. It's got to be connected to another source. Maybe even wireless. It can be in another city... or even another country. Are you saying there is nothing we can do? Yeh, there's something we can do. We can sit here and fucking wait. Wait for what? Yeh look unfortunately the assholes right this time. Sooner or later they are going to come down here yeh. You think they are going to let this end in a police raid? No, we wait. I didn't escape a bank robbery to die in this shit hole. Well you know where the fucking door is don't you. Ltd. You better calm yourself down boy, take a fucking chill pill, Crack one off if you have too. Look enough. Nobody is going to die anymore. That fucking hurts. I know a guy, he'll help you once we get out of here. Sorry to disappoint you but you're not going anywhere mate. They got us here. Right here exactly where they want us to be. Bullshit. It's a great fucking plan. They want us to rip  each other to pieces like a pack of wild fucking dogs and they walk in here like their fucking shit don't stink, take the  money and fuck off. Shut up. Just shut the fuck up man. Your talking is not helpful. Is that right. I'm  just trying to keep myself on an even keel. They say airline pilots have the most  stressful job. Let them a taste of this they would be shitting fucking breeze blocks. I dint see that one fucking coming. What are you so quiet now for? You aint fucking worth it you cunt. Jesus. What a fucking day ay. Should have listened to my parents and become a fucking doctor or something. Here it goes again. Here it goes again. Well done for those of you who made it this far. Well done for those of you who made it this far. It must be hard, but you're  doing well. You know, psychology is a  great science. There's so much human can do when put under shit ton of a stress. Remember, it's all in your head. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Check that thing again, see if there is anything you can do anything with it. Excuse me. For me it just a bunch of numbers, I don't know what they mean. Oh yeh you any good at computers are you? No. Yeh, I didn't fucking think so. Lets just break the fucking thing open. Just break it open. We can't do that I already told you. What's wrong? Did you take it? Take what? The Phone. I didn't take it. It was on the table just a minute ago and. Well I didn't take it. Don't fucking look at me like that. I couldn't taken it. I was standing right here. How could I have fucking taken it? I don't know. You tell us. Could  you? Don't be so fucking stupid. I don't believe him. Give me the phone. I don't have a phone. You don't have a phone? What did you run away from special needs school. I don't have a fucking  phone. Huh you cunt. It's the 21 century. Kind in first grade has a fucking phone. Give me your fucking phone. Whats all this fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. You mother drop you on your head and give you  Tourette's  or something. Fucking hell. He's obviously lying. I'll just take a look. Oy I told you, I don't have a  phone.  I'm  fucking old school, alright? Old school? Yeah. Fucking old school. You cunt. How do I know you aint got that phone? You was the last cunt to use it. You would better believe my word. While he was over there smacking me in the face, You was standing over there by the fucking phone. I was standing right there. Doesn't mean I  took it. Why didn't you fucking stop him? Because I didn't want to. Is that right. I think you had plenty of time to take that fucking phone. Fuck you. I wouldn't take that. Yeh lets just wait okay. Sooner or later its going to ring again. What you think he still might be alive? I don't know. Fucking hell. How well did you know him? Not really at all. We saw him at prep. Yeh same. Yeah... same. God he's starting to stink the fucking place out. Well... I think theres really one way to find out if  he's  really dead or alive. Holy fuck. Gentlemen. I think in fact he might be dead. Shit. Looks dead to me. No shit. Well...I think someone obviously knew that we were coming. There were seven of us. Four of us are dead. Which... brings us to the next question. Could it be one of us? Are you saying one of us is a rat? What about seven. What if seven is still alive? No it couldn't be him. I saw him get shot in the head. He might have lived. No. No way. His brain was everywhere. There's  no coming back from that  it's  just not possible. What you a fucking brain doctor or something? Any of you been to the police or the army? I was in jail for 9 years. That count? I was in army a while back. It  didn't  really work out in the end. Too much pressure? Too little pressure. Same. Look at this, we got ourselves a whole fucking squadron here. Aren't  we. I was in special ops for ten years. Special ops... One little fight with a superior. Kicked me out after 10 years. So after 10 years in special ops and all of a sudden you decided to become a thief? I'm not a thief. I'm professional  with specific skills working freelance. That makes you a thief. Whatever. Well, since we're stuck here. Let's get to know each other. Let's  start with you, where you from? Alright Im a bubble. Bubble and squeak Greek. From Greece where they make the fucking yoghurts. You ever heard of it? Anyway, my parents wanted me to be a doctor, but me  being an awkward cunt I become a thief, didn't I. Started on the street moved up to the banks. People started calling me up asking for specific jobs, six figure number jobs. I could open a bank vault in fucking five  minutes flat. But being young and fucking stupid I got caught, didn't I. Should have become a fucking doctor like my fucking parents said. Sorry did you say something? Were you talking? Who's err who's J Preston? It's me. You're J Preston? Yeah. From where? Philadelphia. Where in Philadelphia? Doyles Town, Or I mean... Used to be. Why? Its not important. Oyy! There not going to hear you. I know there not going to hear me you think Im fucking stupid or something. Its about having a bit of hope in this shitty world of ours. Hope? It's called bullshit. Fucking prick. Oy! Over hear! Anybody! Happy now? Yeh I do feel much better actually yeh. Its good to have a fucking bit of hope. It's false expectations of reality. not kill that's fucking fear. That what you're  talking about. Nah. So? What are you going to do with all that fucking money anyway? None of your business. Spunk it up on a load of rubbish no doubt. Come on tell us cough it up. What you going to do with it? I think I might... I forget  what's  the word for it... Oh yeh... None of your fucking business. That's fucking nice in it. I thought that now where stuck here you would want to share with  us. Me... I'm planning to buy sailboat. What's so fucking funny about that? No its nothing. A sail boats... a great waste of money. What do you fucking know. I fancy sailing round the world. Hard to imagine you in a sail boat. What you fucking know. Fuck you. Just imagine this... You wake up in the middle of fucking nowhere. Middle of the fucking ocean. It's  just you and the fucking ocean. That's it. How cool is that ey? I don't know man. What the fuck do you know? What about you? I don't know. What are you going to spend your fucking money on? That's it you don't fucking know? You wouldn't take  on a job like this unless you needed the fucking money. Come on. Yeah? Got into some trouble in Mexico and only a good amount of money is going to get me out this time. Mexico. What is it drugs? Cars. Well once you sorted that out you'll have a bit of extra cash left over. What you going  to do with it? I don't know. Buy a house maybe southern Italy. Somewhere where  they would  never find me. Make wine. They will find you if they want to fucking find you. Rise and shine. Oh Fuck. Fuck. Wait. It's not what you think it  is. Well, it is, but it's  a bit more complicated than that. I can explain. Yeh, please do if you don't mind. Who were you talking to? Someone I know. Let him talk. What's the good cop fucking bad cop? It's  my wife! He's obviously lying. Im not going to stop him again. Its just some bloke I know about a fucking business. What guy? I knew him years ago, he's a fucking mechanic. A mechanic? What the fuck would you need a mechanic down here for? For a fucking business. What did you tell him? Nothing. I swear. Look at him. He's obviously lying. I told him if he gets me out of here I'll pay him. I'll pay him  good and proper. Where did you get that phone? It was Denny's. The one on the fucking table you twats. What are you doing? I want to find out who called us. Hello? Mike? What's going on? Who's the fuck is Mike? Who is this? Mike? Fucking answer me... Nobody is making anymore phone calls. Jesus. Take it fucking easy. We thought you were dead. Do I look fucking dead to you mother fucker? What I want to know. Who the fuck shot me eh eh? Calm down. Look don't move. Don't tell me to fucking calm down. Can't  you see I'm  bleeding. I need to get out of here. I need a doctor. You, you must be one huh? Yes. That's right. I've got a message for you. Yeh, what's the message? Come here, come here. It says... fuck you! Shit this hurts. And you must be Three? You Five huh? No he's Three. Where are the rest huh? They are dead. What the fuck happened to them? They're dead. Who did it? We don't know. Who you? Me? Huh? Look we thought you was dead. How was I supposed to fucking know? We had to make  sure didn't we. What the fuck is he talking about? What the fuck is this pen doing inside my chest? He means he stabbed you in the chest with that pen. What the fuck did you do that for? Like I said I didn't fucking know did I. You always stab dead people. Only on weekends and special occasions. Holy shit. Where are the rest? They couldn't make it. What do you mean they couldn't make it? What happened to you? I remember I was setting up the system and then flash. I  can't  remember the rest. I need a doctor man. I'm dying. Nobodies dying. We can't go. What do you mean we can't go? We're trapped here. Trapped as of "fucked" or "unclear". I would say fucked. You see that watch  on you,  it's  a bomb. You're kidding right? Tell me what you see? One minute. Say you can do it bro. Please shut the fuck up I'm trying here! Can't you see... Jesus! Alright don't get so aggressive. I'll give you fucking aggressive. Bingo. What? I found something. Did you unlock it? No. But I found something. What is it? Long answer or short? Short. It's fucked. What do you mean it's fucked? That's exactly what I mean. Whoever was messing with this knew exactly what they were doing. Oh that's great. Look man are you sure there is nothing you can do? You're the fucking genius here. We need your help man. If I could, I would. Help with what  I'm  fucking dying here. Can't you see? Nobody is fucking dying. You're not fucking dying. You'll be alright. No I won't. Tell me, have you  opened it? Why not? What's the point? What do you mean what's the point? What are we going to do with it if we can't get fucking out of here. I think we should open them. I want to see that money. No no no no no. No? You just said to fucking open them. It will only help to track us faster and we don't need that. This is all a big fucking joke in it. What the fuck is going on here. Someone has to know. Might be Three. Fuck you. Then it has to be either one of us or how will they know when to come here huh? You're shot. Who shot you? If I knew that he would be dead already. Frightening yeh. What's your problem? I don't know where to start. What day is it? You face...it looks familiar. Oh yeh, I'm a fucking celebrity I am. No, not a celebrity. I only remember faces I need to kill. Frightening. It's Saturday. Saturday? I got here yesterday. That's something. Finally. That's nothing. You slept with my wife. You what? Help! Let him go! It was him. He slept with my wife! That's why I remember you, you  bastard. Don't know what you're talking about. I never saw your wife in my life. Oh this is just getting better and better. And we don't even have any  popcorn? It's you. I know it's you. For fuck sake! It's not me! Everybody calm the fuck down! Look mate I don't know how long your  brain was switched off for but it looks like it was long enough. Stupid cunt! Look we need to deal with other shit right now. Who was down here with you? Nobody. I came alone. That's was  the agreement. We suspect the driver had a deal on the side. Son of a bitch. I used to like him. Hey guys, I don't think I'm not gonna make it. You will make it. Look we all will. It's hot in here. I think I have a  fever. Relax. We are getting out of here. He's not going to make it. He lost way too much blood. We got to get him out or he fucking dies. Is there nothing we can do about. He dies. The money dies. Oh. Lets just open the fucking cases now. Look we are going to open it before we go. Hey! What the fuck are you guys talking about over there? How much longer do you think he has? It depends. On what? Anybody got any fucking music? Hey that's mine. No it's not. Lost and found. That fucking makes it mine. Give it to me. Fuck off leave me alone. Give it here! Its fucking empty. Hey hey. It was a gift. Yeh Im very fucking sorry. Jesus Christ. You got some real works of art here. Enough fucking fights. Stress. Closed environment. They did it on purpose. We can clearly see and hear the outside environment. The mind does some strange shit to you. Thanks for the lesson, doc. There's nothing there. Depends what you're looking for in it. There some dead rats... A lot of them. What's that? It's a phone what. Yeh, I can see it's a phone. Where did you get it? In the shop. Where did you think? We searched you. Well obviously you didn't search me very well if I still have it. It's useless. There's no signal here. Must be those things. They create some sort of interference. What the fuck are you doing? Checking my calls. Yeh good luck with that. I don't need it. There  is a train station nearby, its got  antennas. I've patched  into it. Yeh here we go. Shit. How far is it? Two hundred meters. Give or take. Can they hear us? If you have a grenade. Do you have a grenade? Can we send a message? What else? Want to Facebook post? No you  can't. It's only for incoming  calls. What's the point of having a phone for incoming calls only? Ask your boss. I did what I got paid for. Have you spoken with him? Yes. How often? Everyday. Sometimes twice a day. Can you recognize his voice? I already have. What do you mean? You know what I mean. He's here. He's one of us? Yes. Well who is he? You know, there are moments in your life when  you just can't trust  some people. What the fuck? It can't be. Why? Because I was there with you every time you received a call from your "boss"? It was fucking pre-recorded. What is it you said them. It's  the 21st fucking century. You piece of shit. So what was your plan? Shot us and get away with money? Frankly speaking, yes. But everything went tits up when this shit happened. This  wasn't  part of my fucking plan. So you are saying you didn't do this? Fuck no. Why would I do that to myself? You son of a bitch. I trusted you. You trusted me? Meanwhile  I'm  stuck here with you cunts. What are you talking about? Let me clarify it for you ay. Plan A was to rob the fucking bank. Get out the fucking bank, get in the car, get you cunts back in here and shoot you all. If that didn't work out there was a plan B. Plan B, rob the fucking bank get in the car. If theres no fucking car, escape through the underground tunnels, get you back here same again shoot the fuckers. Bet your asking yourselves whats plan C. Oh yeh there was a fucking plan C. Plan C. Rob the fucking bank, get in the car, no car same again through the fucking underground tunnels. Get you back here. Split the fucking money with you. Yeh I was going to torture you lot, then fucking kill you. But one of you cunts decided to be clever didn't you hay. Are you quite finished? Wow... that's impressive. That's one hell of a plan. The trouble is, you're fucked here with us. Or, am I? Be careful, don't cut yourself. Fuck you. So how did you plan on doing it? Were you just going to shoot us in the back? Stop it. I'm not a  fucking animal am I? Tell me, did you fucking do this? You dosey fucking prick. If I did this I wouldn't be stuck here with you would I. You  fucking cock. I'm  sick and tired of this shit. How much longer are we going to be here? No way. Really? When I close my eyes I can almost see myself on the beach. Hot sun... waves... birds. Fuck the birds. I hate those. Shut up. It's my  fucking fantasy in it. I can see the waitress now coming towards me. She's  fucking gorgeous. Perfect tits. Waitresses? On the beach? What's your fucking problem. Can't a man  have a fucking dream? Bullshit. I would love a cold beer right now. That sounds good. Whats wrong with you Denny? You gone quiet. I don't drink. Just listen to yourselves. Your the ones who should be called fucking crazy. Crazy? I'm not crazy. Im the only one in there right mind here. Guys I need that money. I've  come too far now. And yo need it too. You said so yourselves! Oh fuck what now? How the fuck should I know. I'm not  a fucking doctor. His fucking heart stopped. Oh fuck sake! Hold on a second. If  he's  fucking dead. How we going to open the fucking cases now? I told you to do it before, didn't I? Fuck off. How the fuck was I supposed to know he was going to die. Because in this place everybody dies. Can't  you see that? I'm "aint" going to fucking die. No... which side are you on? I'm not taking anybody's side. Gentlemen. You have been through a  lot. But not to worry. It's almost  over. When the battery in a device that masks the signal dies, police will be on their way in about an hour, and then you will spend many, many years in jail. Or you can chose to die, of course. So, what are you going to do? Make your choice. Time is ticking. I will fucking kill him. Do you hear me! I will find you and I will fucking kill you! Everybody dies sooner or later. Keep that shit to yourself. What's the matter? Didn't go  as you planned? I want you to know... his blood... is on your hands. Do you want to fucking die. You fight like a fucking girl. Talk about yourself. It's a fucking madhouse. This was my favourite shirt. My mum gave me this. Do you know how hard is it to get blood off a shirt? You can afford to buy a new one now. Yeh, but you can't buy history. So are you with me or are you with him? What are getting into gangs now. Make a choice. I'm  on my own. Do you know what the real problem with this place is? See you in hell. Do you have a wife, girlfriend? No. I knew this girl once. Real looker too. You know they say "a girl to die for"? That was her. Well... one day I found out that she liked to go to the same coffee shop that I went too. It was purely by happenstance don't you think I  stalked her or anything... But I showed up with flowers, I was ready to ask her out but err she never came back again. Hey man what are you doing? Can you believe it. It's  been right here the whole time. Who know maybe it's empty. Listen man. It's only  two of us now. There's enough money for us both. More than enough. Yeah but why share when I can have the whole thing? Amazing power guns have. Just squeeze the trigger and all your problems disappear. Don't be stupid man. Don't call me stupid? Don't do it. I'll shoot you. It's Jake. Oh... yeh I know. You would shoot your own brother? Yeah. So we did it again huh? Yeh man. Switch that fucking thing off. Yeah. Oh what just happened. They just died.
