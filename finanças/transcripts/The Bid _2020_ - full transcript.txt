She said she was gonna buy me two 30s and a Pepsi. And you risked that, and you really fucked her? Yeah, that shit was worth it, man. Two 30s? That's about $62. What the fuck is you talking about? You's a nasty motherfucker. Rich, don't be saying nothing to no-damn-body, man. - Seriously. - What, you really fucked her? Yo, I'm going, man. I'm going back to the bunk, man.

Richard Harris. Boone. Alright, have a good one, alright, fellas? - Alright. - I appreciate it. Dear Mr. Harris, I decided to personally write this letter to inform you that I did in fact receive the Live video from Erica today. After reviewing the video, I came to the prison immediately and hand-delivered this letter to your case manager. I am certain this video is the evidence I need to get you released and all charges dismissed. The courts are a little backed up, so it might take a couple days to get you in front of a judge. Salakum! What's up, Boone? I guess now you know I've been doing your wife all kind of ways. I couldn't wait till your black ass got locked up. Karma's a bitch. I told you what you did to Mike was fucked up, man. And now everything you did to him I'm gonna do to you. I brought some condoms to your crib, and your wife told me she hadn't used them in 17 years y'all been together. So why start now? Mnh-mnh-mnh. She vicious. That thing was slippery. I whipped your son last night for nothing. I hope and wish you stay in there for the rest of your life. Your wife let me use your dresser space. Yeah, the top three drawers are mine now. And I know two wrongs don't make a right, but it feels so damn good, man. Salakum. J-Strong, what's up with you? Yeah, we holding it down, man. You know how it is, though, man. Young-ass kids, man. Hey, yo. Hey, yo, that C.O. nigga, he gonna call you, right? And he gonna give you a e-mail address. Send him some beats, yo. Yeah, we about to do some records in this. We about to record. The laptop. For J. He taking the laptop? Yeah, Boone said laptop, too. Alright. Hold on. Boone wants you. God damn, man. Yo, J, yeah, yo, open up a couple of them buttons. Put some 30s in there and close them back up. Yeah, close the buttons back up. Alright. Yo, we... we get back with you. I'm talkin' on the phone, man. People callin'. We on the goddamn run.

Now sit down, act like you got some sense. Look, every year, we play the guards in a basketball game. If we win, we get a conjugal visit with our wives and we get a barbecue. Haven't seen my wife in 20 years since I've been in. How long you been in? 20 years. 20 years! You've been here for 20 hours. So you gonna play in that game and you gonna win that conjugal visit with my wife for me. - You understand what I am saying? - Mm-hmm. 'Cause if you don't, you ain't never leaving here. You gonna be here with me forever. We understand each other? Yeah, I want to cry right now, but I can't. I understand. You need anything to make this happen? Yeah, I-I do need Rich to be the coach. What does Rich know about basketball? He know... He know a little... All you need to do is tell the people to give me the ball. I don't know these guys on the team. I just need for me to get the ball to win. You're the man, right? I'm gonna give you what you want. But you just brought him in the mix. So if you lose, he lose, too. And both of you ain't going home. Alright, man. So let's see what your game about. That's checkmate. Take him back to his cell. Inmates! Inmates! I need you all to gather around. Gather around. Officer Gibbs bringing his son in here through the Scared Straight program. We are only here to give him a reality check. With that being said, there is to be no disrespectful remarks and no physical contact. We have that understood? Understood. Yeah, bring them in here. Fresh fish, y'all. Mm. Oh, you a tough guy. I got somebody for you. Hey, what's happening? What the hell you doing shaking his hand? Dad, you don't remember him from the block? Oh, yeah, I remember you. You're the reason I moved.

Got to get this shit right, man. You got to start throwing them bounce passes a little harder, man. You got to start swinging around that wing. And, Boone, you got to start going a little more aggressive. They're not passing the ball to me, man. I need the ball every time. Let's go, man. Let's bring it in, man. "Convicts" on three, man. Let's bring it in, man. One... two... three! Convicts! You're going to the hole! You're going to the hole! Yo, man. Yo, bro, you good? I knew it. I knew. I knew it. Going through what, bro? They didn't have to do Mowmow like that, Boone. When the funeral, bro? They don't have funerals for cats like little Mowmow. No, no, no, that's wrong, Ju. That's wrong. Everybody deserves a proper burial, man. They sent me his fucking head in a box. Huh? Oh, here I come. Heard somebody calling me. Ain't nobody fucking call you, Boone. But if you want to go, fucking go. Yo, bro, calm the fuck down, bro. Just chill, man. You don't understand. See, Mowmow used to come over to my house and catch little mices in the kitchen for me. She would... She would give us little rewards and treats and stuff. A cat? You talking about a cat? Mowmow. You know what, Ju? I ain't gonna fuckin' hold you, man. I'm not comfortable right now, man. It's just, man, y-y-y-you up here crying over a fucking cat, man. Like, this is crazy. Like, for real, man. Just smoke this out with me, please. Please just smoke one with me. You got weed? Yes, I got to get it out my ass, but... Come on, Ju, man. You want to get it out your ass, man. Come on, now. Anyway, we got hard-ass tissue in here and hard-ass soap, man. Nobody smoking that shit. You can't even wipe your ass properly, man. - Boone. - Nah, man. Come on, Boone. Yo, that was a good-ass game, Boone. Inmate brothers still celebrating, though, cuz. Know what I'm saying?

I was impressed. Second, I want to apologize for you two even being here. Thirdly, I want to commend you two for being the best two inmates that came in my prison. It wasn't all that great.

You got Boone Fake Goon and Rich who thinks he's a vet and the best that ever did it. Not sure which one of them gets to be in the asshole credits. No, wait, I take that back. We gonna give Boone those merits. So I'm glad y'all laughed, enjoyed, and we joked. I'm glad y'all was able to get y'all funny bone stroke. But right now I need to switch gears. Too often in life, this shit is happening for real. This shit is happening to us. Look at the rate they booking us, they cooking us, they roofing us. We may not have all the smarts, but let's not be completely oblivious. This shit is serious and continuous. They say all men are created equal. When I look at the sentencing guidelines, all I see is injustice when it comes to our people. They want the law to be respected. How likely is that when you have laws in place based on misperception? The system is unethical, skeptical. They try to trick us by saying things like, "I want what's best for you." Shit is racially biased. Sick of this racial imbalance. How the hell'd a low-level crack dealer get more time than a wholesale supplier? Shout-out to Barack Obama for passing the Fair Sentencing Act to even out the difference between a big dealer selling powder and a small dealer selling crack. He eliminated the minimum 10-year sentence, and not to mention they said crack was more addictive. But we all know crack was for the hood 'cause it was cheap and coke was more expensive. So damn right it was a difference, but just not the way they made it appear to be. If you pay close attention, shit is just a different form of slavery. By the way, this is the law that got Richard Harris out of prison after serving 11 1/2 of a 22-year sentence. Said he was coming home to show up and show out. And that's exactly what he did. Then he linked up with Boone. And they presented y'all with "The Bid." God bless and good night.
