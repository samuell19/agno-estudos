- Tonight he will have a child! - A stormy child. Small and ugly, small and ugly! - Tonight he will have a child! - A stormy child. Small and ugly, small and ugly... He wants, but cannot sleep The hunger gnaws at his stomach and it is cold in his house - Is this a good time to be singing, Lovis? - It makes it easier. And I think it makes for a happier baby. Wolf, wolf, do not come here You will never get my child Frighten off the harpies. I can't hear myself singing! Fly away, harpies! Tonight I am having a child! Do you understand, you pests?! We are having a child tonight! - Isn't the child coming soon? - Patience, Skalle-Per. This child will be our next robber-chief. Can you comprehend that, you simpletons? It will be strange with a small child in the castle. And with Mattis as a father. Poor little thing. Mattis is the most powerful robber-chief in all the mountains and forests. - Who could ask for a better father? - Is he not like a father to us all? Even to you, Lill-klippen, despite the fact that you're only a common robber. But he is crazy enough, our Mattis. I have a child. Did you hear me? I have a child! - What kind? - A robber-daughter! Here you go... If you want to see the most beautiful child ever born in a robber-castle. How beautiful she is. - Such a small one. - Look how cute she is. - She looks like her father. - Don't be mean, Sturkas. - What will she be named? - Ronja, as I decided long ago. - But what if it had been a boy? - If I decided that it will be a Ronja... ...then it will be a Ronja. You already hold my robber-heart in the palm of your small hands. - You don't understand that, but you do. - Can I hold her? Here is your robber-chief. Just don't drop her whatever you do! There doesn't seem to be any substance to her. What were you expecting? A robber-chief with a beer gut and a beard? - No... - Careful, Labbas. Now there will be two of you who can't talk, Labbas. This will kill Borka. Now he can sit there and grit his teeth in envy. The Mattis-line lives on, whilst the Borka line peters out. - A child is more than he can muster. - He probably doesn't know what to do! Stop bragging. Doom and death! Mattis-castle has been ripped in two! My father's castle! Your life gets an auspicious beginning, Ronja. Ronja, this castle will be a good place to grow up even so. Don't you think? Did you hear that? She answered me! She can talk already! Mattis is a fool. Are you full now? Are you full now? - There we go. - It is good of you to help your mother. What about you, little Mattis. You could lend a hand too. Lovis, we can't keep this child home any longer. We must let her run free so she can learn to live in the Mattis-forest. So you have finally grasped that. I wanted to let her run free ages ago. - It is dangerous. We only have one child. - She'll have to learn to deal with danger. Yes, that's more like it. Bring me some danger! I have waited long enough now! Bring me some danger! It's about time! Tomorrow I am coming! Pull, Knotas! Go now. Make sure to watch out for the harpies, forest trolls and Borka-robbers. How will I know which one is which? - You'll know soon enough. - OK then. - Watch out so you don't get lost. - What do I do if I get lost? Find the right path and find your way home. Watch out so you don't fall in the river. - What do I do if I fall in the river? - Swim! And watch out for the Hell's Gap. - What do I do if I fall in the Hell's Gap? - Not much of anything anymore! I better make sure not to fall in the Hell's Gap then. Anything else? Lots. But you'll learn all that eventually. Go now. And don't yell in the Wolf's Neck or you will cause rocks to fall! Let's see if we have any luck today. You stay here and protect Lovis, Skalle-Per. - You do that. - Protect Lovis? In case some criminal should happen by. If anyone attacks Lovis... Well, then it's probably best if I protect himl. To imagine such water exists. Guards! Guards! Noble lady. Thank you, fair maid, for your kindness to poor robbers. Come now, men. We will get you! What?! What are you doing here, bastards?! Keep to your own forest! We ride where we want, I will have you know. You look pale - The King's guard must have scared the shit out of you! Shut up, Mattis! So you don't get hurt. - I'll show you who'll get hurt. - Is this stuck? - Watch out! He's got the goods. - Lice-poodles! Stop, and let me examine your heart-blood! What do you want?! No, go away! Leave me alone! No, don't come here! Don't touch me! Let go of me, let go of me! - Damn forest trolls! - Mattis... Go to hell, before I kill you all! - Ronja. - Mattis... Ronja, now you know what forest trolls are. - Now you know what forest trolls are. - But not how to deal with them. They are only dangerous when you're afraid of them. To some extent that is true of everything, so it is best not to be afraid. Knotas, I'll give you a bit extra, you're all skin and bones. I heard you met Borka in the forest. Yes, if he wasn't such a bastard. I would almost feel sorry for him. The King's guard hunt him high and low in the Borka-forest. Thank the heavens for the Mattis-castle. At least we're safe here... "Like the fox in its den, and the eagle in its nest." Isn't that what you usually say, Mattis? My heart's pride and joy, where are you going? I'm going to watch out for falling in the river. - Where are you doing that? - By the river, if it is to be of any use. Little beautiful girl! Now the blood will flow! Now the blood will flow! Flow... Flow... Now the blood will flow! You will never see the sun again! - Where is she? - Where is the little girl? I can't see her! I can't see her! I can't find her! I can't find her! My, my aren't you wet. Did you jump into the river? Now I've watched out for everything except falling in the Hell's Gap. And I'm going to watch out for that just as soon as I'm dry. I'll take care of it when I've dried. You're such a wise and obedient child. I know who you are. You're that robber's daughter that runs wild in the forest. - And who are you? - Birk son of Borka. I live here. We moved in last night. Borka, Undis and me. And our twelve robbers. - Is the north-castle full of bastards?! - No, only honest Borka-robbers there. But over there where you live it's wall to wall with bastards. - That's what I've been told. - Just wait until Mattis finds out. He'll have the Borka-robbers out of the north-castle before you can blink. - That's what you think... - Borka-vermin... Go to Hell! Come over here and I'll break your nose. Follow that, if you can. You're not so hopeless after all. - Hold on and don't move. - There isn't much else to do, is there? Here you go! Start climbing when I holler. Go ahead! - You did good. - Go away! Give me my strap! I might be tied to you even without it now. - No you're not. Leave! - Don't do that again! But it was kind of you to save my life. - I will see you again some time. - I hope you fall, you bastard. You would deserve as much! You're lying, Ronja! Borka doesn't have a son! - Yes, he does! - I've also heard people say as much. Undis had a child out of the blue that night with the terrible thunderstorms. Why hasn't anyone told me?! What else haven't you told me?! Here you go. If you must waste God's gifts. But make sure to clean up after yourself. Safe as the fox in its den, and the eagle on the mountain top! - It's as I thought! - Enough! If you've got fleas, then deal with them. Don't just stomp around here. This probably just got more tender. Some dirt cleans out the bowels. Eat now, Mattis. Don't be sad. All you have to do is throw them out. - That might be easier said than done. - But how did they get in there?! You lazy bastards! Have you not been guarding the Wolf's Neck night and day! Did you think they would come that way, walk up to you and politely say: "We're moving into Mattis-castle." - So, which way did they come? - From the North of course. Stay here. - You devilish thieve's consort! - I thought you were thirsty, Mattis. What kind of mouse of a husband do you have that can't even control his own wife? Come out if you dare, Borka! Can't even have some fun around here. You mongrel thief! There's been enough fun around here! Don't you eat swills like all other swine?! Shut up, woman! I can't live in the Borka-forest any more. The King's guards are thick as flies there. A man who moves into someone else house without even asking has no honour! Damn robber! When did you ever ask permission for anything you have taken?! What does he mean? Mattis hasn't taken anything without asking, has he...?! You know, Ronja... maybe... Cat got your tongue, Mattis?! That shut him up! - Are you in a hurry, robber's daughter? - That's none of your business. - What do you want, robber's daughter? - Leave my pheasants and my forest alone. Your pheasants? Your forest?! The pheasants are their own and it's a pheasant's forest. It is also the fox's, the owl's and the adder's forest. And the forest dove's, the hawk's and the cuckoo's forest. And the gray dwarfs', the forest trolls', the rumpnissarna's and harpy's forest. And the snail's, ant's and spider's forest! And the deer's, wild horses', moose's and wolf's forest! - I know all the life in this forest. - There forest is also yours and mine. But if you want it all for yourself, then you are even stupider than I thought. I don't mind sharing the forest with pheasants, owls and spiders. But I mind sharing it with you. Ronja! Ronja, stop! Ronja! Ronja, this fog is scaring me. Are you afraid you won't find you way home? Then you'll have to stay with the pheasants. You have a heart of stone, robber's daughter, but you know the way better than me. Let go of me. Here, but keep a rope's length between us. As you wish, robber's daughter. Come! No, Ronja! Stop! It's the call of the underworld! Come! Yes, I am coming... Ronja! Stop! Ronja, stop! - Yes, I am coming... - Stop! I am coming. No, Ronja! If you let the underworld lure you down, you are lost! Let go of me! Do you want to live in the underworld forever? - Have you been bitten by a fox? - Never you mind. I can find my own way from here. Aren't you clever, you little shit! Go to hell, won't you! You spend so much time in the forest, eventually you'll turn into a gnome. And where do you keep, Fjosok? How can you find so much stuff every day? Yes, it's strange and miraculous. You will have to be cunning as a vixen if you want to drive out Borka. To be cunning as a vixen is not my strong suit. How was the forest today, Ronja? We were... I can't really remember. I think there was fog. There sure was, we could hardly find our way home. Mattis, what did Borka mean? What is it you have taken without permission? Look over there! It looks just like an old man! He resembles Borka, two of them! - What have you taken without asking? - A lot. I could count... - Don't! - Have you taken anything without asking? And... You are an innocent child, so I haven't told you any of this before. - No, and we haven't been allowed to say anything. - Isn't it your bedtime soon, old man? No, I want to listen to you explaining to Ronja what it is a robber does. Well... I'm not sure how to put this... you know... what to say. No, but I do. Robbers take as much as they can from other people. - Doesn't that make them angry? - Yes, so angry they scream and cry. Old man, go to bed! Ronja, you have to understand. One day you will be a robber-chief. Will I...?! Never! Not if people get angry and cry! But I still love you, Mattis. You see, Ronja... I only take from the rich and give to the poor. That's right, you gave a whole sack of flour to that old widow with the eight children. I did indeed. That's right! You have such good memory. That must be at least ten years ago. You give to the poor every tenth year. Go to bed! Or I will put you to bed! I think it is brewing up to a storm. I can feel it in every bone in my body. The wolf howls in the forest night. He howls out of hunger and sorrow But I will give him a pig's tail Suitable for a wolf's stomach Wolf, wolf, do not come here... Well, well, Fjosok. If your greatest desire in life is to shuffle snow... I can promise you a delightful winter. Why... My leg is stuck! - Why... - Why, why... Why is she doing this...? Why is she doing this...? Ruining the ceiling! - She is stuck in the ceiling. - I didn't mean to. Help me! Why is she doing this...? Ruining the ceiling... Why? - Help me, come on. - Why, why? Why is she doing this...? Push me in the stomach! Why? - Why is she doing this...? - Go to hell! - Oh, why is it so dark? Is it night? - Why? Don't go. Help me! - Little baby boy. - Hang it on the big foot. - She is stuck in the ceiling. - Baby boy. Good place to hang... in the crib, like that. - But the crib, look. - Now it gets properly rocked. - Help! Help me, come on! - Why? Help! Help me! - Screaming and shouting - why? - All this noise, why? - Here comes the head too. - I turned into night, why? - Why did it turn into night? - Why is she doing this...? - Why did it... - Why is she screaming like this...? Help me! Beautiful little human! Beautiful little human! Laying there and resting! Let me go get my sisters! Then she will never rest again! The night when the thunderstorm shattered Mattis-castle, Ronja was born. Mattis and his robbers were so happy that they didn't see a thing. - She resembles her father - Don't be mean, Sturkas. - Only Lovis kept her calm. - Are you full now? Eleven years later, Ronja went into the forest on her own. Next night she fell asleep on a rock and met the evil forest trolls. And the terrible harpies that never leave her alone in the woods. One day she saw a boy of her age, on the other side of the Hell's Gap, that shared her faith. - And who are you? - Birk Borkason, I live here. Suddenly, Birk jumped over the Hell's Gap. Ronja also jumped - out of anger. Birk tripped and hanged helpless, but Ronja saved him. Here! Start climbing the rope. When Mattis found out that his archenemy Borka moved into the second half of his cracked castle, he was furious. You're lying, Ronja! Borka doesn't have a son! When winter arrived, Ronja went skiing in the woods and her foot got stuck in the roof of a dwarfs' den. - Why is she doing this? - Is it already dark outside? Help me free myself! A harpy was flying above her and she was stuck there, helpless. And that is where we will continue our story. Let me go get my sisters! She will never rest again! Ronja, aren't you going home? - Here, let me help you. Hold on to me. - Never leave me again! I won't. As long as you keep a rope's distance between us. I'll get you loose. Why, why...? Careful with the baby boy! Waking the baby so he gets snow in his eyes. Why? - Why is she doing this...? - Nice baby boy. She broke the ceiling. Why? Now I'm going home to Borka-castle, but you can't know the route I take. - Birk, I wish you were my brother. - Then I will be your brother, robber's daughter. I would like that, but only if you call me, Ronja. Ronja, my sister. - Did you have a good time in the forest today? - Yeah, pretty good. Well, this is fun isn't it? The Wolf's Neck is blocked by snow so no one is getting out until spring. Until spring...?! How will I see... - How will I get to the forest? - No one is getting to the forest until spring. What misery! Twelve snowed in robbers and you on top, Mattis. We'll just have to try to keep our sense of humour. I see a chief, a little shit. What can he achieve? Almost nothing, no nothing for his name is Borka I see a man so big and strong that no one is his match He is the greatest chief and his name is Mattis This chief just gets bigger and bigger the more beer he drinks What if one pretty day he swells so much he explodes swells so much he explodes. - Where are you going? - To the basement to get more beer. Are you coming? Let's see, Ronja... That was some storm I tell you, that night when you were born. Just above us here is the Hell's Gap. But what's behind those rocks? Borka, that fox, probably stashes his beer somewhere back there. - If he has any beer. - That's a lot of rocks. Pelje, Knotas, Jutis, Tjegge, Fjosok! - Get out there and shovel snow! - My back still hurts from yesterday. Sturkas, take Turre and go fetch water and firewood. - You expect me to carry firewood? - You expect me to fetch water? You're all lazy as oxen except when it comes to fighting and robbing! Get to work! - Birk! Is that you?! - Ronja! - Have you forgotten that you are my brother? - Not at all, my sister. - Are your eyes as black as always? - Take a look if you dare. Yup, you look just like yourself - just a little paler. But you don't look like yourself - you're all skin and bones. That's because I haven't been eating much. - Don't you have food in Borka-castle? - No, my belly hasn't been full for a long time. Eat, if you're hungry. - Ouch, my back. - Delicious! To hell with being hungry. Quiet, someone is coming. Come. In here. - What in the name of the devil are you doing here? - Not drinking beer, that's for sure. - One can't shovel snow all the time. - No, I'm staying away too. Lovis has started combing for lice and spring cleaning the robbers. Out! Get out there! You too, Mattis! This can't be good for you. - You're ripping my hair out! - Bullshit. A chief should be free of lice. Skalle-Per, aren't you going out in the snow to clean off some of that muck? No, it won't stop me dying. So I choose to die with my muck intact. Die?! Forget about that. I haven't lived a day without you, you old goat. We'll see, little boy. I see a chief wearing a dress evil as a troll. When people freeze to death, she stands by and giggles. - There's only women's clothing left. - This was made for you, Knotas. Am I not free of lice soon? Yes, I just like to feel your hair in my hands. - It's so soft. - So is yours. - I have to go now. - We can only meet in secret. I hate sneaking, but without our meetings I wouldn't have survived the winter. How many times are you planning on saving my life, my sister? As many times as you save mine. We can't survive without each other. Soon it will be spring! Then we can meet in the forest. Now he's going to get it! Hoj, hoj, my bastards! Now, finally Borka and his thieving dogs are going to get what they deserve... - ...until they fall flat on their faces! - Sit down. Do you have to hate each other? Ask Borka what he's doing in Mattis-castle. But now he is leaving! Does it have to involve bloodshed until everyone ends up dead? - The child is wiser than you, Mattis. - Well, you come up with something better. Soon Borka will be history. - I have to go to the forest too. - Yes, run along to the forest. Ronja, if anything happens to you I couldn't go on living! Birk, where are you? Birk! - Finally! I have waited so long. - Have you? - Have you? - But now it is spring, Ronja. - I have one of these too now. - I can feel the winter washing off me. Soon I will be so light I can fly away. That was my spring howl. If I don't howl, I will explode. I just want to lie here and be in the spring. I like that about you, Birk, son of Borka. Look! There goes my winter hat. - Aren't you going to thank me for the loan? - Why? Why is she doing this? - Wild horses! - Let's catch one! - Easy... - You can't ride them the first day. We must show them that we mean no harm. Easier said than done. I already tried, but he bit me. That rascal! He bit you... Ask him. "Rascal"... That would be a good name. - But he is also wild and crazy. - Yes, I should call him "Wild Stallion". There you go, he's calm now. Easy. I said I'm going to ride you and I will do it. Do you understand? - Giddap! - The name... Wait! - Yeah! - Stop! Wow! Heigh-ho! Yeah! - Hey! - I won't be riding anymore today! Come, let's dry ourselves. Come on, Borka! Piss ant! You yellow belly! Come down, if you dare! Even spring is ruined by a couple of bull-headed robber-chiefs. There is too much bile in the air. - I want to go home now. - We have to go our separate ways. No one can see us together. - What will Borka say about this? - That's what we all want to know. - You look happy. - Go home and you'll see what happened. A toast to Borka! Ronja, you were right! There was no need for bloodshed. Now Borka will go to hell before he has time for his morning fart. Look over there. Look what I caught just now with my bare hands. You animal! You can't do this! You can't do this! What is it I can't do? Rob if you must. Money and things. But not people! - I won't be your daughter if you do. - What are you talking about? I have caught a vermin, a louse. And now I intend to clean my castle. Then you can be my daughter or not, as you please. Damn you! Damn you! You shouldn't say such things to your father. Fjosok, go to the Hell's Gap. And send a message to Borka. Tell him I want to see him up there as soon as the sun rises. - Don't touch the vermin! - This wound needs cleaning. Get out, all you men! Get lost! You never do anything but damage! Do you hear that, Mattis? Get out! Damn you, Mattis! Mattis, you lousy dog, you bastard! Come out, so I can spit in you ugly face! May the devil claw your eyes out, you cowardly child-robber! God damn you, you ass. You devil's eunuch! Make your own son, instead of going after the one I bore for Borka. - Can't you make your woman shut up? - Ah Mattis, you damn... You are dismal, Mattis. Going after my son to get us to leave. That is low. I want to know when you intend to leave. If I get my son back... then I will leave before the summer is over. Then you will get your son before the summer is over. - And I'm saying I want him now. - And I'm saying that you won't. We have dungeons in Mattis-castle. So he will not want for a roof over his head. Let that be some consolation, in case we have a rainy summer. No! Just cry! I would cry to if I had such a beast of a father. Silence, woman. I will deal with this. Now, Mattis... We have dungeons on this side of the castle too. Now can I have my son back? - Sure. I'll give you your son back. - At the same time you will get your child. You do know bartering, sheepdog! - I don't have a child. - What kind of shenanigans is this? Here is your son. But you can't return my child to me. I don't have one. But I do. And I want that child back now, Borka. Even if the child's father has gone insane. Are you going? Get over there! - What have you got going on with her? - She is my sister. Well, we'll see about that in a few years time. Don't touch me. I can't stand your hands on my body. Birk! - Ronja. - Don't speak to me. - I am so glad you're alive... - Don't speak to me! The wolf howls in the forest night. He wants, but cannot sleep. Birk! Birk! Where are you? Birk! Birk, where are you? - Screaming and shouting in the forest. Why? - Screaming and shouting. Why? - Birk! - Screaming and shouting in the forest. - Birk! Birk! - Why is she shouting like this? Why is she shouting like this? She's been screaming for three days. Why? Why? Because I miss him. Can you understand that, gray dwarfs? - Ronja! - Birk! Now there are two of them shouting. Why? - I'm moving to the forest. - But, why? Why? I can't stand the nagging and the yelling any more. I want to get out of Mattis-castle as well. I was born in a cave, so I can certainly live in the Bear cave. But can you? I can live anywhere with you. I'll come tonight. To the Bear's Cave. I'll be there waiting for you. Enough is enough! I'm tired of this. Mattis has been laying in my bed, staring at the wall for three whole days. Doesn't say anything, doesn't eat anything. Come, Mattis, sit down and eat. Everyone is waiting for you. Are you full now? Goodbye, Lovis. Maybe I will see you again, maybe not. I'm sorry, but I have to. Go away, forest trolls! Right now! - Birk, where are you? - Ronja, I've been waiting so long. This is for you. - Eat, then sing me the wolf song. - Does that mean you want to sleep. I spent all day cleaning up after the bear that lived here last winter. - I have carried firewood. - Where there is a fire, there is a home. Yes, this is our home now. The wolf howls in the forest night. He wants, but cannot sleep. But I can! Hunger gnaws at his stomach and it is cold in his house. It should be Lovis. Mattis... I don't have a child! I don't have a child. I don't have a child! - I'm frozen stiff. - It is coldest at dawn. Let's get the fire started. Come! This is the last of the milk. After this there is only cold water. That won't make us fat, but it won't kill us either. Cover your ears, here comes my spring howl. You see! Spring comes when I call for it. - I was thinking of getting some water. - Thinking doesn't get us any water. Something smells nice. Is it ready soon? - Now we will have food for several days. - And salmon tastes nice. - What's wrong? - I cut my foot. - It can bleed for as long as it likes. - Lovis used to put moss on the wound. I'll go and get some. Who knows when you will cut yourself again? Do they think we are at fort Mattis now? I mean, our parents. It would be odd if they don't. - Do you think they are sad? - I think it's different. Undis is sad, but she's more angry than sad. Borka is angry, but he's more sad than angry. - I know Lovis is sad. - And Mattis? I think he's just happy... ...that I am gone, so that he may forget me. Are you bringing salmon again! We never seem to eat anything else. Even so, it's food. The moss is dry. Now you can cut yourself again. - Throw me the knife. - The knife? You have it. - No, you had it last. - I don't have the knife! - What have you done with it? - Me? Nothing! You had it last. You are lying! I thought I told you that without a knife we cannot survive in the forest. You're a little shit placing the blame on others! Robber's daughter! And one is supposed to live with you. You won't have to anymore, Borka-robber. Live with the knife, if you can find it! To hell with her! Damn her! The knife? But then... Oh no... - Ronja! - Why, why... - Let her stay in the forest for all I care. - Why, Why? - She'll come back sooner or later. - She'll come back sooner or later? Just let her try... "It's too late now. You should have come sooner." I should have come sooner? Why, why? Ronja! Here, in the cracked Mattis-castle, chief of robbers Mattis, and his arch enemy Borka, were living on different sides of Hell's Gap. - Birk, is it you? - Ronja! Mattis' daughter Ronja and Borka's son Birk... were meeting each other secretly during winter, in the basement of Mattis-castle. Yes, it's you. Just a little paler. And in the spring they played in the meadows. One day, when she came home from the forest, she found Birk tied up and bloody. - Her father had imprisoned him. - You can't do this! Mattis said that Borka had to go away from the castle in order to have his son back. But Ronja ruined his plans. She jumped over Hell's Gap to Borka's side. Mattis was devastated. Here, take your son. You can't give me my child back. Because I have none. Ronja and Birk went to the Bear's Cave. The wolf howls in the forest night. He wants, but cannot sleep. Mattis rode in despair and was nearly crushed by a boulder. The guards heard him scream and helped him by removing the stones. Ronja and Birk lived in the wilderness, at the Bear's Cave, in rain and sun. One day, they had a discussion over a missing knife. - Live with the knife, if you can find it! - To hell with her! Then Birk found the knife under the moss. He was desperately seeking the missing Ronja. Ronja! She's probably gone home to Mattis-castle. Poor thing! Who has treated you so badly? Birk! Birk! Birk! Did you see the bear? It killed her foal. - These things happen in the forest. - But I don't want it to! Quick - go get the moss. Otherwise she will bleed out. Poor thing. There, all done. Why why... Why are they doing this? - So she won't bleed to death. - What about her foal? Gone! Doesn't exist any more! - We know. - Gone! Gone... - Too bad the knife was lost. - Good thing I found it again. It was lying right there under the moss whilst we were yelling at each other. - Things can turn out so wrong so unnecessarily. - That's why we should avoid the unnecessary! Come! They're not as shy anymore. Your foal should have had this milk. Now you can give it to us. We need it. Let's ride! That's how it's done. - Rag-rut and wild-child, good names. - We'll put the straps in their mouths. - Look how little milk there is. - Soon we will have neither milk nor bread. - Thank you, Lilja. - Next summer you will have a new foal. Wild horses have a good life, even in winter. - It's summer now, my sister. - Winter... Who? Ronja! Lill-Klippen, is it you! To think that you have come! Nice view you have here. You can see the river and the forest. You haven't come to look at the view, have you? No, Lovis sent me. With bread. Lovis bread... Birk, look! We've got bread. Smells nice! Lovis figured you would be running out of bread by now. Ronja... Are you coming home soon? Everyone's waiting. - Mattis too? - That beast! Who knows what he's thinking? He says nothing. - Doesn't he even mention my name? - No. I'm never coming home! Not as long as I am not Mattis' child. Tell him that. I don't think even Skalle-Per would dare pass on that message. - So you didn't go home to your father then. - I don't have a father. I can survive without a brother as well. Sorry if am being unfair, but I know what you are thinking about. That I have lived through eleven winters, but the twelfth will be my death. Forget the winter. It's summer now. Leave my shoes alone! - Birk, harpies! - Duck, Ronja! Now the blood will flow! Where are the little humans? Where are they? - Birk, where are you? - Here. Hurry up! Now the blood will flow! Where are the little humans? Where are they? Nowhere to be seen, nowhere to be found. Nowhere to be seen, nowhere to be found! Not to be found here! Nowhere to be seen, nowhere to be found! - I though you had drowned. - Not yet, but soon. Can you hear the waterfall? Let go of the branch! Lovis! My child! - Your hair is wet. Have you been swimming? - We did some swimming, Birk and I. - Aren't you going to greet my mother? - One doesn't greet uninvited guests. - My mother taught me that. - She should have taught you some common sense. Birk is... tired. - You know why I have come. - Not to give me bread, I suppose? - You can have bread when you come home. - I'm never coming home. - Then Mattis will jump in the river. - He doesn't even mention my name. Every night he cries in his sleep and calls your name. It's hard to watch someone suffer so inhumanly. - Come home. - I can't, Lovis. - Not even if Mattis asked you himself? - He never will. Go to bed. I'll sit here till it gets light. Then I'll go on home. I want to fall asleep in your lap. And you will sing me the wolf song. The wolf howls in the forest night He wants, but cannot sleep Hunger gnaws at his stomach And it is cold in his house Wolf, wolf, do not come here. - What's the matter, Birk? - I am sitting here mourning. I want to have this summer in peace, without messengers from Mattis-castle. You'll be returning there when the winter comes. I'll be staying here. And freeze to death? I don't care if I live, if I can't be with you. Who says that I am going back to Mattis-castle? I intend to freeze to death on my own, if that is the way it has to be. But now it's summer, Ronja. It's a rainy summer we are having. But it will get better. It's a windy summer we are having. But it will get better. - It's a cold summer. - You're not very careful with your life. - I'm going to get some water. - I'll come once I've got the fire started. My child, my child... I have my child! Am I your child now? Am I really your child? Yes, Ronja, as you have always been. How I have cried over you. My god, how I have suffered. Is it true what Lovis says, that you will come home if I ask you? Ronja, come with me. I have not asked you yet, but I'm doing it now. Ronja, follow me home. Birk, son of Borka, come over here! - What do you want? - Honestly, to beat you up. But I won't. I am asking you to come with me to Mattis-castle. Don't imagine for one second that I like you. But my daughter does. Are you saying that Birk can come home with us? - I need to speak with Birk privately. - But after that we are going home. Does he think that I going to become a whopping boy for the Mattis-robbers? Would you rather freeze to death in the Bear's Cave? I think so. One should take good care of one's life. If you stay in the Bear's Cave you are wasting your life. And mine. - Your life? What do you mean? - Yes, if you're staying, I'm staying with you. - Whether you want me to or not. - I wouldn't want to waste your life, Ronja. I'll follow you wherever you go, even if I have to live amongst Mattis-robbers. - Ronja! - Lill-Klippen! Thank you for letting me see Ronja whenever I want. But now I am going home to Borka, and see how he and Undis are. If only your father wasn't such a bastard, or we would do what Skalle-Per suggested. - What has Skalle-Per been suggesting? - He has so many crazy ideas. - To think that she has returned home to us! - I have never seen a dirtier child. - Never. - My dirty child has come home. Now I will perform my happiness-fart. Well, one needs to give people a proper salute when they return home. - Ronja? - What's the matter? - I just wanted to make sure you were there. - Of course I am, stupid. Borka and Undis were so happy to see me. I never thought they cared about me. You can stay with them until spring comes. Then we're moving back to the Bear's Cave. The King's guards are after us. Hide! Just you wait! Soon I will crush every measly little King's guard in the Mattis-forest! Brag when you're riding home. That's what my mother always used to say. The King's guard will win if you don't do as I say. Don't bring up that madness about me and Borka joining forces again. Who would be the chief? Borka? The strongest will be the chief. Let a fight decide. You're sure to win a fight between the two of you, you ox. I think it would be best if all of you stopped robbing. Then how would we live? Are you aware that there are people living who are not robbers? Welcome to the nature... - My beauty. - No...! No! You moron! You got me for good! I'm not fighting with women. - The King's guard. - Borka... Thieving dogs! Now you will get some! You bastards! - Shut up, thug! - Should we rescue the virgin? Retreat! Thanks... Although you are a bastard you can be helpful sometimes. Even a bastard like you deserves help against the King's guard. - Maybe I will help you one day. - Stay still, Borka! We shouldn't fight each other. A single strong band of robbers with one chief. Good idea! I know one that would suit. He has brains... and power! Come and I shall show him to you. It gives me great grief that you're such a bastard. Otherwise I would have made you my second a long time ago. And it gives me great grief... that I will disfigure your face. For you're already uglier than ought to be legal. It will pain me to smash you up so badly... that Undis will cry when she looks upon you. Mattis is and remains the strongest robber-chief... in all mountains and forests. Borka, you will still remain chief in name as well as in honour, but from now on my word is law, you understand that? Here they come! Open the gates! - Come on. - How are you, my Mattis? Little Borka, you could use some beer about now. Not this way. Over there, over there. - We won! - Go and sit down over there. Don't feel bad about loosing the fight today, Borka. When you and I are gone your son will take over I should imagine. Ronja doesn't want to. And when she says no, there is no changing her mind. Then only Birk remains. - Does Birk want to be a robber-chief? - He does. I, Birk, son of Borka, swear that I will never be a chief, for as long as I may live. There is no winning with children. One just needs to learn to accept that. - Though it's not easy. - Cheers. Come here, let me show you something. Come on. Not me! Satan! Lovis, wake up! I'm in pain. My only consolation is that bastard Borka is lying over there in even greater agony. Satan! Undis! We beat the King's guards, you should have seen us. That Mattis isn't as stupid as he looks. Fjosok! Take this one. Now we have earned a proper feast. Skalle-Per, we tricked the King's guard real good. That Borka isn't as stupid as he looks. Try to eat some soup. It'll warm you up. - Aren't you better yet? - No. I might as well lie here and stare. I'll stay here whilst I'm waiting. - What are you waiting for? - Have a guess. - What's the matter with him? - Old age. - That won't kill you will it? - Well... - I won't allow it! - You don't get a say in this. Ronja... It gladdens my heart that neither you nor Birk want to become robbers. It was alright in the old days. Now they hang you for robbing. People scream and cry when you take their stuff. I couldn't stand it. No, you could never handle it. Do you remember when I told you about the little Grey dwarf? The one you saved? Then he insisted on giving me... Look, here comes Mattis! You look all drained and your eyes are red. Are you sick? No, you're the sick one. - Skalle-Per needs to rest now. - First I want to hear the end of the story. Well, you know the little brook... - You can find your way there? - Yes, I can find my way there. But you have to wait until spring, naturally. - Don't crowd me. - I'm so cold. And you're so warm that the blood boils in your veins, Mattis. Come here, I'll give you some warmth, old man. He's dead! - He's dead... - Not at all. I have enough manners to say goodbye before I go. But now, dear friends, I must take my leave of all of you. For now I am dying. Now he's as dead as any living human can get. He has always been there. And now he is no more. I know that no one lives for ever. We are born and we die. - What are you grumbling about? - I miss him! I miss him so much it hurts. Do you want me to hold you? Yes, please, hold me. You too, Ronja. - Birk? - Yes, what is it? There exists a mountain made of silver. A Grey dwarf showed it to Skalle-Per. - I'll believe it when I see it. - Well, what is this then? Lumps of silver can be good. But they won't do us much good in the Bear's Cave. - You can't eat lumps of silver. - No, you can't. Have you spoken to Mattis yet, about moving out to the Bear's Cave? Not yet. I'm afraid. - He's going to be mad. - But you have to. - You're thinking about moving out? - Yes, I am. My old cave! I lived there every summer when I was younger. There is no better place to live. What do you say, Lovis? - Last year's apples are rotten. - Not all of them. Go, child, if your father thinks so. But I will miss you. - Help, now he's angry. - I'm not angry at all. Surely one is allowed to throws things at walls and have some fun from time to time? You will come back in autumn as usual? I will do what I normally do, and you will do what you normally do. But the Bear's Cave is mine. I'll come and say hello. Fine by me, but it will be a relief not to have to see his curly head every day. Surely one is allowed to throw things and have some fun from time to time? - Or what was it you said? - Come here! Now it's only you and me. You and me!
