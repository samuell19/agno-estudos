"You need to get out now. - What are you doing? "We were eating, were not we?" Monsignor. If this our friend really wants to leave us, then, with humility I say that he needs a good omen, a new name.

Why do not you answer me? And you, why do you ask these questions? Because when I saw the money, I thought it was not yours, right? Is it stolen? It's just the world I see on my way. And how it is? I remember it once. I was five years old. I was in the country, and it was a very hot year and the door... from the kitchen, there was an ant hill, I heard them call... I took the sugar, then put a little and in the morning... and they began to eat, and without knowing it... I was very happy... But then one day, my grandmother began to scream. Oh God, these ants, these ants... and with her rubber boots, she began to crush them. I screamed! No Grandma, no! Do not they also have the right to live? You're right but you've felt the pain in the world. How is it? What I have? The pain of the world. And who cares about the pain of the world? I'm not boring in it. Do I look like a leopard? You fool. Damn it! I will sleep with you. Do not. Thomas. - Hello. - Sorry. I exaggerate. I saw her running naked through the corridors. How did we get to your aunt? As soon as we land at the port. So, well... You will soon be with her. Yes. So I wish you luck. It's all right? My aunt sent me a message that she could not come and get me. You will be fine? Yes. Where does your aunt live? In Malaga. Malaga? But it's far from here. You're going in that direction, right? Yes. But I travel alone. "And why not?" "Are not you going upstairs?" Hello guys. Hey, what are you doing here? The motorcycle? The motorcycle? Look, little Mazona, We're going to Granada for a date. Do you want to come with us? No, I'm sorry guys, but I gave my word. You better go without me. And who is this? I'm giving him a ride. Good Bye, little Mazona. Now little Mazona. Give me a ride? Never thought it would be so wonderful. - How am I going? - Very well. Thank you. I know how much you care. Let's go visit there. Do you know how farmers eat grapes? Get yourself a grape... and a piece of bread. This was not kindly offered to those two idiots in the restaurant. Luckily they were not cops. One of them was drunk and fragile. At one point he pulled out his wallet. With a little seduction and when your friend went to the bathroom, someone like the wind, led. Best, a girl took him. At that moment, yes, it was that I felt alive. Alive? Like a fish in the water. That will be very good! WELCOME TO ALMERIA - We arrived at the inn. "It's about time, I'm tired. Tomorrow, from here I will go to the desert. "And your aunt?" - she's waiting for me in Malaga. I sent her a message. - Are you sure? Yes. Good. It was a beautiful trip. Wonderful.

"Practical guide to keeping the heart healthy." HELP YOURSELF. SALOON Thank you. LYRICS OF THE DESERT Good Morning. Hey, what are you doing here? Look at you. This is not jelly for scorpions. Understood? Out! I just came to return the book you lent me. Thanks, but I have another one. - You read? - Not. Was cold. I made another. It's great. This is the most beautiful moment of the day. I can not wait for tomorrow, to be here again. But is not that boring all day, watch the same movie? There is no aunt, right? No. So now I do not have anything else to ask her about. Where are you going? Listen to some music in here. Would you like to read a little? The time to light the fire. Mary, blessed are they that believe. How do you keep faith in how Jesus grew? Could this child, who peed in the corner, be the son of God? We started well. What else do I have to read? Continue. I need to start over. The Bible, in the days of my youth, was a forbidden book. The Bible, a forbidden book? - I did not know that. - You are not the only one. In the lonely desert I came to know that a peasant woman had been betrothed to a boy. Finally, bride, boy. This is getting interesting. The girl had not yet moved in with him. I linked to this fact, the music of the Gospel in which Mary had been promised to Joseph but they did not know each other. For a while. I will read. I'll keep on. So after two years later, and away from friends in the desert they asked if the marriage had happened. In the midst of great disturbance they held your throat and ordered. The girl's throat was cut. Five minutes of rest. Carry on. I'm chocked. Before the wedding, the family had discovered. Even Mary was conceived with the Son of the Holy Spirit before even knowing Jos√©. Small, helpless Mary with a large belly. At night, in the dark, I could not see the stars. He returns to us with many eyes of all Habitants of Nazareth. They looked at the boy's mother and said, How did you get the son unlucky and miserable, survived? I reply that those who insult him God, the father of this little one. and believe me, sweet Maria, little mother How did you deal with so many enemies? Who's going to believe you? Through the night, I felt the first time of his approach. The mystery of Mary. I felt close to her. It was not healthy as a statue, motionless. She was my sister. Sitting next to me. - I'm going to sleep. - Good night. Lucia. Lucia. Look at this. And? But how, so what? It is a flower that does not grow here. And then you woke me up to show me that? It grew at night. Yes and tomorrow there will probably be more. Do you understand anything? I want to get out of here. Did it work? I'll have to change the ignition cables. Do you have them? No. I have to go to the city to get them. I kicked your flower. I destroyed it. She also left me dry. Are you Italian? Why don't you sit down with us? No. Leave her. She's stupid. She's not worth it. Who do you think you are? It's like all of them. - Here it is. - Thank you. This morning, a young woman with brown hair passed by? - With a big bike? "No, no, sir." Sorry! Has anyone seen a young woman with long hair and a big motorbike? "No." "I saw her. She was a whore. I wanted to take her to bed and she ignored me. I saw her too. But let's solve this. First I'll go with her and then you will. I'll kill you. Hey, little man. I will finish you. So? Is it your best? Your beans, sorry about that. Allright Sir. - Please sir. - Thank you. Thomas, what are you doing here? Got my bike. You went out during the night and did not return. That is not correct. That's not fair. What should I think? Tell me! Has something happened to Lucia? Any accidents? Maybe at night, he got off the road? No one could find her. Wounded, or the worst. Mary, come quickly. There are lot of girls. Dad, please stop! Maria, where are you going? Are you crazy? - Where you go? - Hey, lady. Your friend is dead. Dead! - What did you say? "Your friend is dead." - Where is he? - In the horses' corral. It was worth walking in the desert on foot. Let's hope it works. It will work. I put my hands on it. Look at those teapot shaped stars. That is the constellation of Sagittarius. But of course. And right there, where those four stars that form a square, It's your tattoo, Pegasus. The winged horse of the hero. Yes, how do you know? I know a little. As a child, I visited the planetarium. I watched the stars. I kept waiting for them to come in the twilight. I dreamed of seeing the northern lights. The Aurora Borealis. I would stay here every night to contemplate these stars. It was my desire as a child to go to the planetarium. Perhaps You enjoy seeing the stars because there's something inside you. Inside of me? Inside, because the word desire means nostalgia for the stars. In Latin, the star is "desire." and I must say that the lack of desire is reflected in a star. My grandmother said: Point and make a wish. By pointing I lost the star. I believe that everything that exists, maybe let us be part of something very big. We are part, part of the infinite. Lucia. Did I hurt you? Is that why you came here? To hear the infinite. I'm choking. I want to be with you. Help me. Help! Help! There's a scorpion in the hut. - At where? - In there. Do not worry. I worry. It's big and black. - It's just a puppy. - Watch the door. Be careful! Did you find him? So there it is. Malandrinho. Got him? Is dead? Open the door. I got it. You do not want to kill him, right? No. It will not be accurate. There must be enough poison to kill a horse. - Am I right? - Even an elephant. Now I can let you go. Not so close. Not here. This is all his. - This is a good place. "Further from the door, please. But His family is here. Did you know he could have 40 to 50 little brothers? Ready. Now go to your family. That is the question. How would it have been if they two had not had this child in Jerusalem? It was prophesied. I found this. It's my grandmother's song. What is happening now? It is not happening. What happened? You woke me up with this vintage song at 6:30. It's because I fell asleep. I was listening to the news when that ridiculous song began that for many years did not heard. And to think that the boys said that she scared the death. The girls also said. Blessed are they. Thomas, I have to go to the village. What bike should I use? Which do you prefer? - Mine. I hope you have time to explain what is happening. Hi, aunt. Sorry, but now should I call her Rosy Floriana? Yes, I'm officially in the bookstores now. That's true, is not it? Now enough nonsense. Let's talk seriously. What do you think you are doing? Are you crazy? You left a note on your cousin's bedside table, Paula. which said you were going to Malaga for a ride. This is dangerous. I was worried. I found someone who gave me a ride. A good person. - Lucia. - I'll introduce you. I hope you know what we do at the end of the world. My friend, Thomas. St. Bridget, Queen of Hungary. A hippie, retarded. Thomas, this is the famous Aunt Rosaria. Rosy. - Rosy Floriana, writer. "The one that does not exist?" When would you speak well of Aunt Rosaria? This is all very fascinating. Epic! "Now, show me your room." - I will sleep in there. This is the last of your adventures. Or rather, the last of your bullshit. You must stop with your manias, and go back to the city. I feel good being here. Let me stay just tonight. Do what! "Will I see you tomorrow?" - Yes. Really good! But where was that idiot? I told him to wait for me. - Wait a moment. "I will not walk again. Miss, Rosy. I know you want to go back to the city. Would you like a ride on my bike? How I traveled with Lucia. Why not? For you. "It was a pleasure, Rosy. "It was all my pleasure, Thomas. You know me now. Did you light the fire by yourself? I took care of everything in our cabin. It's exactly fifteen paces to her. I have to say something about myself in a good place. It's a beautiful thing. You know that necklace that you like so much. "I saved my mother's date. "You said so. Yes, but I did not say who it was made for. It was an Indian, Alaska. It is. "I always wanted to go to Alaska." - From Alaska. I wanted to say too, that I do not know how to tell you but then I want to say something else. The infinite is not in me and I am no longer afraid and Thomas, do not be afraid. Not even you. - My heart sometimes... - I'll take it... Not! I've had this for several years. It will soon pass. I just need to rest. I never knew what to do. The flower, that flower... Yes, a guarana. It's alive. I'm glad. I know she will forgive me and so will you. I'm afraid. Lucia. Lucia. Lucia. You love Me? Yes, I love you. How nice. Look. See how beautiful it is. Lucia, she had never said anything about her heart. I could not avoid. We are not responsible. It happens. The fact is she will not come back. Friend, it's me. "I am Friar Felicino." - Do not say. You came back and did not tell anyone? We were worried about the convent. The one who sent me was the monsignor. He asked me to bring him spiritual comfort. I thought about you, that lonely desert. Poor man in the desert alone, however, also inspired me. I thought. If he is alone in the desert, you have no one to complain to. Did you understand what I said? Alone in the desert, he does not speak. Alone in the desert, he has no one to argue with. Understood? My brother, I'm glad you returned. Now listen to what I'm going to ask you. Monsignor's request. What is the favorite watermelon of old people? There's nothing to do? I do not know. The seedless. Now my friend, you're smiling. Attending the monsignor will come to my house for spiritual comfort. Your morals and even the stars will feel at peace. See you later, brother. And now in the final. It's the last chance... Hi, Thomas. At dawn, when you were still asleep and I saw a fox that was hanging around our hut. He also watched dawn. I would bet to say that if I fly away through the stars, Would you take my flute? so that he could remember the good times together, so I put this note in the case and when you look at the stars even without me Thomas, imagine that I went to Alaska where only there the light reflects the long polar night. My father was not a good guy. My name is Lucia. My mother had a hemorrhage and died. The hospital was too far away. When I was two years old, my father left me with my aunt. but before disappearing from the circulation of history, I was only a year old and I stayed a whole night with my eyes wide open to watch the Aurora Borealis. Traveling again, Thomas? Where are you going this time? Towards the South. No! Not this time. Let's go north. Right, Thomas? " You know... I now, I can see the Aurora Boreal whenever I want, but you without me No, you will. This time, I'm going north. Hey, your change. Translation, Subtitles and Synchronization: Anumalik QUETTA PAKISTAN
