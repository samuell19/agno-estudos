- Are you sure we should go in there with just the three of us? - You worry too much. It's a business call. This guy's always professional. - Yeah, but- - Eh, don't worry about it, Junior. Anything goes down in there, I'm gonna gut 'em. - Gut 'em? - Yeah, gut them. - Is that what all you Brits are like? - What's that supposed to mean? - Well can't you just say like a normal person? - Like what? - Take care of it. - Take care of it? - Yeah. - What does that mean? That's really fuckin' vague, Grant. My Auntie Belinda takes care of her cat. My mum takes care of my laundry. If they say I'm taking care, what does that mean? Nobody knows. But I say I'm gonna gut someone, you know exactly what it means. - Enough, gentlemen. Enough. - Yeah, sorry, boss. - Yeah, Grant's sorry, boss. - Oh, those are nice looking knives you get there, huh? - All right. Enough. Now we're doing this. And if things go south, I trust both of you to handle it. Understood? - Yes. - Capish? - Yeah, capish, understood. Gotcha. - All right, let's go. Let's do it. Go in. - Good evening, Mr. Schiavone. Your guests are already here. - Thank you my friend. Hey, do me a favor. Buy those beautiful grandchildren of yours something nice. - Oh, oh no, Mr. Schiavone, I'm sorry, I can't accept this. - Of course you can. It's my pleasure to take care of my friends. Otherwise you'd offend me, Gino. You don't wanna do that, do you? - No, I can assure you I don't want to do that. Just gimme a minute. - You got it. - Hey, why are you giving that guy all that money, huh? He owns this fucking restaurant for Christ's sake. - Hey. Watch your mouth. As long as I'm still breathing, I make the decisions and you follow my lead and look imposing, not the other way around. Are we clear? - Yeah, got it. - Kid has a birthday coming up soon, doesn't she? - Jada? - Yeah, in a couple months. You remember? - Sure I do. We should talk about throwing a party or something. You know, 12 is a big deal. - It is a big deal. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought these guys were waiting for us. What's the hold up? - Okay. - Good to see you, my old friend. - Good to see you, too. It's been too long. - So your mind, is it okay? - Did I forget something? - Well, I thought we had decided that there would only be one other person as a bodyguard. - Well, forgive me. One's just a driver. Go wait in the car. - Are you sure? I'll be right outside. Don't fuck it up. - I won't. - So, not to be rude, but we're not young men anymore. So why are we here, Rooker? - 48 hours ago, I had a shipment coming to these docks from Vera Cruz. Now that shipment by now should be in my hands making money for me, but it's not. The ship that that shipment was on was refused access to these docks. The captain had to leave before he could unload my goods. - So you can keep trafficking in our fucking city? - Your city? - You know the rules, Rooker. We don't traffic that in this city. My city. - I think the agreement that we had is not very equitable the way I see it. - Well, that's your fuckin' problem 'cause we ain't changin' shit. - Grant! - I see your son still hasn't learned his place. - What did you say, old man? Hey! Put it down! I'll put a fucking bullet in your head. - Is this how you thought you were gonna get your way? - Yukio is very sensitive. He doesn't take well to aggression. - Well how does he respond to bullets? - Put it down, son. You were never good at playing nice with others. Put it down. Now, this is how it's gonna be. - Dad, dad. - What the fuck happened? Fuck. - I need an ambulance. My father's been shot. - What are you doing? Hey, hey stop, stop that. - Please hurry up, please- - Hey, stop! - Hey, what are you doing, man? - Stop. We can't call anyone. Grant. Grant, we gotta go. Grant, they could be back. We gotta go. - Fuck you, man, I'm not going there anywhere. - There's nothing we can do for him, Grant. We gotta go, okay? Come on, we gotta get outta- - Ow! - Fuck, you're hit, too. Grant, we really gotta fucking go! - No, I'm not leaving him here! - We gotta go, we gotta- - Stop! Stop it. I'm not leaving him. - Okay, Grant, it's okay. Look, G, he's gone. He's gone. You'll do your father no favors by staying here and getting arrested, okay? He told me to look after you and I'm not doing that if we're in jail. If you want to avenge your father... Come on. We gotta go. Sorry buddy. We gotta go. Come on, man. - No. - What is going on here? - Hey, what the fuck, man? - We gotta make a clean getaway. Come on. Out, out. Go on. We gotta go. Go, go, go. Come on, come on! All right, here, get in. - Sombra doesn't have friends. - Yeah, you can keep bullshitting me all night, but I don't think Sombra will appreciate knowing you're the reason his special delivery has been delayed. This is quite a selection you've got here. Oh, shit, you got Maker's. It's one of my favorites. A lot of people back home say it's too light, but they don't really know what's good. Alcohol's just so connected to culture and environment. You can't really criticize until you've experienced it for yourself. It's the same with business. You wanna understand someone, if you wanna truly know them, you have to meet them in person. Otherwise, how do you really know who's good or bad? Sombra running late? - Sombra's not coming. - Shit, shit, he's blown. Pull him out now. - Get out of there, Ray. You're blown. Get out, now. - At least he could have told me to my face. - Ray? - I came a very long way to deliver this. - Dammit! He isn't going to abort. - How far is back up? - Too far. - Get in there, get in there! - Why did you do that? - Oh, come on, Ray. She just saved your life. - They would've taken me to Sombra. - Jesus, Ray. They would've taken you after beating you half to death. - But they would've taken me. - You deal with him. - Yeah, thanks to you two my cover's actually blown. - You're welcome. - Can someone please explain to me how the hell this happened? - We're working on that. - It's not good enough, Al. All right, I spent six months of my life developing this lead, six months. And now it's down to drain because what? 'Cause this place is full of holes? - Is he fucking serious? - I know you're not talking about me. - We don't have a lead. - Then what happened, Al? - Look, you think I'm happy about this? I could be home with my wife having a home cooked meal. Instead I'm stuck in Bogota with your stupid white ass and two of the Three Stooges. This mission is as important to me as it is to you. So I need you to sit down and calm down and we'll figure this out. - How? - He's too close to this. - Fuck you. - Hey! We'll figure this out. You two, go cool off. Hey. I'll get you another shot. - Hey, Ray? Ray, are you in there? - No. - You got a phone call. - Take a message. - It's from the states. He said he's your dad. - Really? A printed newspaper? I can't remember the last time I saw one. - I can't remember the last time I saw my son. You all settled in there? - Yeah. My room looks like a 90s museum. You know it's okay if you wanna repurpose it, Pops. You know, get yourself home gym or a media room. - That will always be your room, Ray. - Wow, look at these two knuckleheads, huh? - Inseparable knuckleheads. You hungry? No, I'm actually going over to the hospital. - You still gotta eat, Ray. - Dad, I'm good. - Do an old man a favor, huh? - All right. - He knows who did this, Ray. - So when did he get started working with his father? - I'm not sure. - Everyone knows Carmine Schiavone, right? You know, Grant was supposed to be the good one of the family. How, how the hell did he get sucked into this life? - I don't know. - Okay well what do you know, Dad? - He's not gonna risk anything that the police could get to them before he does, that's what I know. - Yeah, we both know that. - How long has it been since you spoke with him? - It's been a while, Dad. - He went through some tough times when Beth got cancer. Turned his life upside down and... - And what? - Ray, you were his rock, you know that. You guys were like brothers. - No, don't. Don't do that. Come on. - No, do what? - Make me the bad guy. - You had to go. But he stayed. He felt left behind. - Yeah, I know. And I wasn't there for him. I know. - It's not your fault. He needed someone, something and, and he turned to Carmine. - Yeah, and there's always a catch with Carmine. Fuckin' always. - He's his father. He wanted Grant to come work with him and so he did. The first order of business is to find the people that killed his father. - Well you know if this escalates, it's gonna end bad for everyone involved. - He's gotta hear that, Ray. Beth wouldn't want it. - No. No, but Carmine would. - We have to go make him choose. - Come on. Give me my water, you bastard. - Is that what they teach you to talk like at that fancy private school? - Ray-Ray! - Ooh! Hey Jay-Bird. Oh, wow, you got so big and that is some attitude you got. - I mean, it has been forever since you've seen me. And daddy. - I know. I'll do better, all right? I'm sorry. - You better. Daddy said that he chose you to be my godfather because, "He was the most responsible man I know and he would protect you with his life." - He said all that, huh? - Yep. Although he was on a lot of medication, so he might have been high. - Jada. - Pops. - Princess. How is your father? - Um, yeah, I don't know. I mean every time that we try to go in there, Mr. Vincent makes us leave. - Who? - Mr. Vincent. He says that Daddy doesn't want any company. - Hey, why don't you take us to your daddy's room? - Okay. - All right? - Come on. - Jada, look, it's Ms. Carucci. Nice to see you, Ms. Carucci. Look who I bumped into committing misdemeanor assault on a water fountain. - No, no. - I'll let that go since we haven't officially met yet. - Oh yeah? You gonna let that go, too? - You're a funny guy. - Are they okay? - Yeah, Uncle Ray-Ray's giving them jujitsu lesson. - Oh. - What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck are you? - I'm the guy who's wondering why his goddaughter can't see her father? Who are you? - Are you a cop? 'Cause you're giving me all kind of police vibes. - Not exactly. - Not exactly. That's exactly what a fucking cop would say. Would you do me a favor and take a long fuck off walk down that corridor? - Why don't you tell him it's Ray. - Oh. The infamous Ray Rose, is it? - The one and only. Get the fuck outta the way. - Come on in. - And you, you pathetic bunch of cunts. Honestly, I may as well have had the fucking nurses do it! I hope you don't think you're getting paid after that pathetic display. Fuck's sake! - Tellin' me all I had to do is get shot to bring you home? - Funny guy. What'd the doctor say? - I'm shot. - No, shit. Well, at least you still got your sense of humor. - Yeah, well they didn't take that. - The sooner, the better. We've got a score to settle and it isn't gonna settle itself. - Hey... Look, I'm sorry about, about Carmine. Pops said the two of you were getting close again. - Yeah. Thanks. - He also said you're ready to burn the city down looking for the guys who did this. - Let me guess, the cop disapproves. - Yeah, you'll know when I'm talking to you. - I'm fucking talking to you. Are you serious with this guy? Listen, TJ Hooker, we're on the same fucking side. - Well yeah, whose side is that? - His side. - Ray. Look, he was my father's right hand, protect him with his life. So he's my right hand now. I'm gonna need both of you if I'm gonna take this son of a bitch Booker down. - What? You can't be serious. Grant, let the cops handle this. Come on. - Is that a joke? The cops? The cops are another gang out here, mate, like they are everywhere in the world. Grant, they're not gonna want to get involved in a war unless there's something in it for them, you know that. - Do you hear this shit? War? Is that what you want? Look, think about Jada. She's sitting out there concerned for you because Mary Poppins here won't let her in to see you. - Yeah, well, I didn't let her in. Okay? That was me. - Why? I don't want her to see me like this, you know? - So what, you let her sit out there in the dark wondering what's going on? You don't think she had enough of that with Beth? - How would you know, huh? You were nowhere to be found when Beth died. Let her in. - You sure? - You heard him. - Hey, baby. - What happened? - This? Oh this is a couple of scratches, couple bumps. I'll be fine. - You're lying. - Hey. - Well you are. - Hey, Vincent. Why don't you go home? Huh? Come back in the morning, we'll get to work. - Well, I'm not gonna leave you here am I, right? - Get the fuck outta here. - What you looking at, old man? - I'm not too old. - He ain't worth it, Pops. - Fuck that lot of ya's. - Hey, baby, I'll be all right. Especially now that you and Pops and Uncle Ray-Ray's here, huh? But listen, I think you should go home with Ms. Carucci. I need to talk to Ray-Ray. - But... - Jada, Jada, why don't you come back home with me, huh? We'll watch some movies, have some ice cream. It'll be nice. - But I just got here. - How about, how about you just do what the grown ups ask you to do, hm? I'll see you soon. - Fine. - Oh. Don't hurt me, now. I'll see you later, okay? All right. Ouch. - Yeah. You know, I don't want to hear it. - I haven't even said anything yet. - Yeah, I can feel the Ray Rose judgment all on your face. Now save it for somebody who didn't just see their father gunned down in front of him. He killed my father, Ray. And now they'll try to kill me. And they're trying to take me away from my daughter. Should I let that go? - You go down this road, a lot of people are gonna get hurt. - Yeah, no, that's their problem. - No. Goddammit, no, it's your problem. It's Jada's problem. Is this the kind of man you wanna be? What are you teaching her? - Teach her how to defend this family. How to stand up for herself and the ones she loves. - You have got to relax. - You know, when my father told me to come work for him, I thought it was just so we could protect his business, make sure his legacy could live on. But now I, I don't know, maybe it's- - We gotta go. A car load of Rooker's men just pulled up outside. - Well how do you know they're Rooker's? - Because I'm really good at what I do. Look, your old man trusted me and now you've gotta trust me. We gotta go, but right now. - Fine. - No, what are you doing? - Did you hear what I just said? There's a car load of these days coming here. What do you think, they're coming in and giving them get well soon balloons? - How do they know what hospital we're at? - Jesus Christ, it doesn't matter how they know, they're here. I gotta get him out the back. - Hey, go home. Go home and play with your goddaughter. - Go. - Hey. - Excuse me, is there a stairwell near here? Fuck. - Shit. - I'm out. - Come on. Let's go. Come on, up. We gotta go. Come on. - Hey, that's him. That's the guy. Hey, watch out, Ray! - Come on, get into the car. - Hey, what are you doing? Stop! Get in, get in! Are you good? - Yeah, I think I'm good. Your wound is open. - I'm fine. - Grant. - I said I'll be fine! What are you doing? - I'm rallying the troops. - Hang up the phone. - Rooker's gonna keep sending more men. You know that, right? He's gonna keep sending people until you're in the ground. We need every man we can get right now. - I said hang up the fucking phone. How did Rooker's men know where we were? I mean they didn't just know what hospital I was in. They knew the exact room I was in and they came directly at us. So, who'd you tell I was at Mercer? - Me? - Yeah, fuckin' you. - Who the fuck's talking to you? - Hey, don't look at him. Answer my question. - Nobody. I didn't tell fucking anybody. Are you fucking serious? - Grant. You need to calm down. - Stay out of this, Ray. - You need to chill out, all right? I'm a fucking law enforcement officer. I let way too much shit slide, I can't let you kill this asshole. - I'm not gonna kill him. No. Not while we're driving. I'm gonna shoot his fucking balls off. Who'd you tell? - Come on. No. - Who? - I told some of the... Nobody, okay? Nobody. Did you forget that they were fucking shooting at me, too? Fuck's sake. Take it easy, Grant, okay, please? - You better not lying to me. - I'm not lying. - Ms. Carucci, I remember. Yes. No gluten, no peanuts. Almond milk. Um, I think I, I'm out. I tell you what, I'll go pick some up, all right? You know, I have another call coming in. I'll call you right back. I promise. - She's just gonna call right back. - Hey, is there anything that you can eat? - I can eat anything in moderation. - Moderation, huh? - Yeah, too much of anything is bad for you. Surgeon general told us that. - Really? - Is there anything that you can eat? You are pretty old. - What the hell is this place? - Rooker operates out of here sometimes. - All right, so what's your plan? - Well what's yours? - Same as before. You know, call the cops and let them handle it? - Fuckin' hell, has anyone ever told you you're like a dog with a fucking bone? Doesn't loyalty or honor or respect, doesn't any of that mean anything to you? - Yeah, you should know the difference between defending honor and getting revenge. - Shut up. - Ray, I told ya. If we're not down for this, then go home. Stop wasting your breath trying to get us to stand down because it's not happening, okay? My father's killer, he's gonna be dead before the sun goes down. Understand? - Okay, so what's your plan? - You know my plan. I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna ask a question and then I'm gonna shoot somebody. And then I'm gonna ask the same question, if nobody answers it, I'm gonna shoot somebody else. And then again, if nobody answers that question, the same question, I'm gonna shoot somebody else. Okay, 'cause I'm gonna keep shootin' until I get my answers. - That works for me. - Get down. - Come on, get out here. Come on, come on. - Come on. Where you going, where you going? Get over there! Keep going, get in there. - Son of a bitch! - Is that what I think it is? - He's been sex trafficking this whole fucking time. That meeting was a fucking smoke screen. - My father forbid this. - And they killed him for it. - But this is what you need to put an end to them. All right, you got proof right here. Sex trafficking puts the whole organization away- - He's not still talking about calling the fucking cops, is he? - No, I'm gonna handle him. Then you can call your cops. - So you're gonna get revenge no matter what, right? No matter what the cost, no matter who gets caught in the crossfire? - Nobody in that house is innocent. Let's go. - You're wrong. Those girls are innocent. - Get in there, shut up! Get comfy, ladies. This is your home now. ♪ Oh man I got a lot of gold ♪ ♪ Stack that bread like dominoes♪ ♪ Anything is possible ♪ - Don't move! What part of don't move did he not understand? ♪ Oh man I got a lot of gold ♪ - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - Hey, if you keep shooting everybody, who's gonna answer my questions? - He fucking moved. What did you want me to do? - Come on, we're gonna get you out of here. Let's go. Shh. - Be quiet? There's a firefight going on. - Once you get to the road, find the nearest person, house, car and call for help, okay? Go, go, go, go. - Hey, ah, ah, ah, sit your fucking ass in that chair. - Sit down. - Do not be a stupid cunt. - Dammit, Vince, is he dead? - All right, all right that was partially my fault. Only partially, though, because you know what? If I hadn't of shot him, G, he would've come in and shot you. But you should take partial responsibility for it. - Me? For what? - I don't like to criticize you in front of... Look, mate, honestly? I don't think you said don't move loud enough when you came in. The people in other rooms, I don't think heard you. I've said it now. Look. - Okay. Are you listening? Don't move or you're gonna die. Did you hear me? Did they hear me? - I think you're doing it too loud now. There's only two of them. - Where's your boss? Where's Rooker? - Wait, wait. - No! - What the fuck did you do that for? - He's down! - He's down when I fucking say he's down, okay? - What are you gonna do with that? - Whatever the fuck I like. Listen, you're either here to help us or you can fuck off, and that's the last time I'm saying that to you. - Grant. - What the fuck did you do that for? - I told you what was gonna happen. Nobody answered my questions. Fuck 'em. They can all die. Why don't you look for something we can find? Something's gotta tell us where Rooker is. - Hey. How many people am I supposed to let you kill before I take you in? - What's that supposed to mean, huh? You're gonna take me in? - Yeah, I'll do whatever I have to do because you're not gonna listen to reason. - Well what happened to I don't wanna be the one to tell Jada daddy's not coming home to telling Jada daddy's not coming home because of me? - I'm serious, Grant. Cut this shit out. - I agree, and it will end when I kill Rooker. Understand? What'd you find? - Yeah, rather surprisingly, I found fuck all because you killed everybody we were about to ask questions to. Like honestly mate, what the fuck you playing at? - What's the matter, you wanna watch something different, Jada? - No, I mean, that's the point? It's all fake anyway. - Fake? You never heard of a talking fish? Who has a friend who can't remember anything? Come on. - I'm 11, you know. Not a baby. - Excuse me. Okay. You wanna talk about somethin'? - He never wants to spend any time with me. - Sweetie, there's no one in the world your father would rather spend time with than you, believe me. - Yeah, right. - I know it may not seem that way sometimes because he's always working, but everything he does, he does for you, like all good fathers do. - Yeah, right. - Can I ask you something? Have you ever seen your father cry? I have. - When? - 11 years ago. The day you were born. - Was he sad? - No. He was happy, sweetie. Probably happier than he's been his whole life. - Really? - I saw him cry with my own eyes. - What was that? - Well, that was probably just a raccoon trying to get into my garbage cans. I'm gonna check it out. You finish watching the movie and I'll get a refill on this? - Sure. What the fuck are you doing in my house? Jada? Let her go. - Pops! No, no, stop, you're hurting him! Pops! No, no, stop, stop, you're hurting him! Pops, please! - So we think this is a good idea? Just sitting out here in the open when someone's out there trying to kill him? - Yeah, let 'em come. Where the hell's the waitress at? I need a straw. - Fuckin' same old Grant Schiavone, man. You know, your bullheadedness is gonna get you killed if your ego doesn't first. - So be it. Hey, waitress? Yo, hello? I need a straw. Hello? - Dude, relax. I'll get you a straw. - I don't need you to get me a straw, Ray. - What is going on? - Stop trying to fix everything. Stop. - I think he wants you to stop pretending to be his mum. - Yeah, we're all set. - Eat your waffles. - Told you you wouldn't like it. - I'm just trying to help, okay? - Yeah, well, I don't need your help. We're not kids anymore. I don't need you to swoop in and save the day. - So, what am I doing here? - Yeah, I was kind of wondering the same thing. Look, besides Jada, you and Pops are the only family I have left. And if anything was to happen to you, too, because of the Schiavone business? No, that's not gonna happen if you keep on insisting being my protector. So why don't you let me help you for once? Go home, Ray. - Amen to that. Do you need me to call you an Uber? Hm? - Yeah? Who is this? - You've cost Mr. Rooker a lot of money tonight and took something from him. - Oh, tell your boss to fuck off. We didn't take anything from his geriatric ass. We've been in the city all fucking day. - You should not have interfered with Mr. Rooker's business. He valued those girls very much. And since you took that away from him, he will now take something away from you that you value. - Where's Jada? - Call Pops. - I'll get the car. - We gotta go. Dammit! All right, come on let's go. - I'm fucking going, am I? What use is it if we speed and we get pulled over, then we're not gonna get there. - Hold up. - Hey, get back in the car. - I'm on a job, this is my father's house! - Hey. - Get back in the car! - Hey fuck you, man, my daughter's in that house. Hey, Ray. - Hey. What the fuck? - Get the fuck. - Hey, get back in the car. - My daughter's in there! - Hey, hey, hey, don't you fucking touch him! Hey. Don't I know you? - No, I don't think you do. - Yeah, I think- - Get back in the car, take it around, the street's closed. Hey, hey. - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, listen, it's his daughter, okay? It's his daughter, hey, relax! Relax. - Hey, shh, shh. - You need me to move the car, right? - Get the car outta here! - Dad? Dad. Jesus Christ, what happened? - We don't know. He hasn't been able to say much. Looks like a home invasion. - Dad. - They beat him up pretty bad. - They're gonna take care of you, all right? - Where's Jada? - They took her. Masks. Devil masks. I tried. I'm sorry, Grant. - Hey Pops, hey Pops, I know you did. I know you did. - Ray? - Yeah, Dad? - Family, no matter what. Family, right? No matter what? - Dad, Dad? - What's happening? - We gotta go. Please, just let us go. - Fuck, things are getting out of hand. Where's Jada? - Rooker has her. - Shit. Do you remember when your father was getting annoyed because cops were kept flipping over to Rooker because he was paying them more? - Yeah. - You see that guy? He's one of them. - Are you sure? - I'm fucking positive. I told you I recognized him. We went around to all of their homes one by one and trust me, he's got a fucking hot wife. If you wanna find Rooker, I say we stop following bread crumbs. - Let's go. - Hey, where you going? - Stay with Pops. He needs you. I don't. - So what do you wanna do? - Follow him. - Yes, boss. - Needs you. - Dad, he's a grown man. You need me. - No. Not he, she. Jada. Find her. - Dad, cut it out, all right? Take it easy. - Find... - Can we hurry up, please? - Could this guy be more of a cliche? I mean he's a cop in a donut shop. Fucking hell. - All right, let's go. - We can't pick him up here, mate. - Yeah, let's go. Hey. Get in. Now. - Shit. - Good boy. Come on. - I know you know who we are. And we know who you are. And more importantly, we know who you work for. - I work for the city of Los- - Oh! - I'm a fucking police officer. Are you crazy? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Mind your manners. - Where's my daughter? - Daughter? Who the- - Ah! - Are you all right? - He's hurt. Clearly needs to go to a hospital. - Hey, do not talk unless you're answering some of his questions, you stupid cunt. Now stay down, for fuck's sake. - You know, you're right. I should be in the hospital 'cause I was shot, the same day my father was killed. And now my daughter's been kidnapped. Good friend's house of mine. So I need you to listen to me very closely, huh, huh? Closely, 'cause there's no scenario where you get back into your squad car without telling me where my daughter is. And I know who you work for. And guess what? You used to work for us. So, imagine all the ungodly shit that we could pull up on you. You're entangled with both families. - Why go through the trouble, boss? I say we just fucking pop him right here and then we drive to that house of his and we cap his kid and we murder his fucking wife. That's after of course I've got her to do some unspeakable things to me. - You motherfucker! - Hey, don't fucking look at me. Answer his fucking questions, hm? - Where's my daughter? - Stand up. Come here! - Come! - Smile. - I want to go home. - I wanna go home! Let me go! Let me go home! Please. Stop it, Jada. Stop it. If you're crying, you're not thinking. What would Grandpa do? What would Dad do? Thanks for that, too, Grandpa Carmine. - Yeah? - Hey, hey. I need you to run a trace on a call, all right? Let know as soon as you have location. Number is 973-415-9604. - Okay, no worries. Hey, Ray, is everything okay? - Hey, I gotta go, all right? Call me back when have something. - All right. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, Pops. Take it easy, all right? Take it easy. You want some water? Take it easy, all right? - J... Jada. Okay? - No. I don't know. Grant is out there looking for her, all right? What, hey, hey, what is it? What is it? Stop, stop. You're gonna hurt yourself, all right? Stop. - No. You... You go. Help your brother. - No, what? No, no. Grant will find her. - You, you! - What? - I'm so proud of you, Ray. - I know you are. I know you are, Dad. I'm proud of you, too. Pops? Pops! No, no, no. Pops. No, come on, please don't do this. Pops! - We need you to leave now. - What is happening? - Outside, now. - But I'm his son. - We're gonna do everything we can, sir. Ah! - Hey! - Hey, let me go! My dad's gonna kill you! - Don't make me hurt you, kid. My boss will kill me if I damage the goods. Or we find a supplier. If you try to leave again, you're gonna get hurt. Don't push your luck. - Don't push yours. - Stay! Or... - You got something for me? - Something you need to tell me? - Just taking care of some family business. - What kind of family business requires you to use agency resources to trace a phone? - The important kind. - You think I don't already know what's going on? - Then you know what I have to do. - I know what you think you have to do, but this is not the way, Ray. I need you to stand down. - Not gonna happen. The last thing we need is for your face to be plastered all over the news being associated with a local turf war between two crime families. - Turf? You think this is about turf? You think I would be involved if this is about turf? - Ray, listen. - I gotta go. - This is not a request. I'm ordering you to stand down. I can't stop you from here. I'm ordering you to steer clear of your friend's drama. That's all I can do. What you do next is completely up to you and the consequences are yours and yours alone. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yeah. You're telling me to choose between my job and my family. - I'm asking you to decide where your loyalty lies and proceed accordingly. - Message received. - Ray? - Yes? - Get in. - Okay, Ray. We're headed to the storage place on Roosevelt, right? - That's right. - Got it. Oh, I'm Candy by the way. - Got it. - All righty. - Did you run a trace on that number he gave you? - No, sir. Not yet. - Don't. - Where's my daughter? - Fuck... You! - Boss, are you sure you don't want me to take over? Or do you at least want a donut? It'll give you like a sugar boost. - No, it's my daughter, it's my pain. - All right, they're good, though. - I can do this all night. This one? This one's for Pops. Ah! Where is she? - If she's lucky, she's on her way... To a cartel leader's house in Mexico. Some big mansion where she can be really well taken care of. If she plays nice. - You gonna stick to that story? You stickin' to that story? - Where's my daughter? - Fuck you! - Are you done? Yeah? - You sure? Tell him, tell him. - Rooker keeps all this girls in the old Westfield Warehouse while he waits for buyers. That's, that's where they'll have her, if they haven't sold her already. If they haven't sold her already. - You better pray to God that they haven't. - Please. Please, I have a family too, man. - You think I give a fuck about that? - I have a family, too. - Leave him. - Boss, what do you mean leave him? We gotta fucking do him, haven't we? - What's he gonna do? Tell the truth? Hm? Yeah. He's not gonna see in the inside of a prison. - You hear that, buddy boy? You might not believe this, but this was your lucky day. Good luck explaining all this shit. How do you wanna do this? - Well we can't go in there guns blazing until we know Jada is safe. - All right, then we go in quietly. Get the lay of the land. And then we go guns blazing. - When Jada's safe, you can shoot anybody you want. Kill everybody if you want. As long as we secure Jada first. - Yeah, I know. Come on, let's do this. - Shit. - Are you okay, Ray? 'Cause you look like... I mean I can smell the negativity coming up off you like cheap cologne, which is funny because your actual cologne is nice. I'm fine. - Are you sure? Because I'm a really good listener. You know, dropping people around is just my side gig. I'm actually a licensed therapist. - Thank you. I'm fine. - If you say so. But that negative energy needs to be dealt with, 'cause I don't have any sage in my car- - Ma'am. I heard you the first time. - Hey. It's me. I tracked down that number for you. - But Doss. - Doss was a great agent a long time ago, but now he sits behind a desk and he's forgotten what it feels like. - What what feels like? - The need to right a wrong, to fix what needs to be fixed. And you, you're the best I've ever seen up close at doing that. So, if you ask for help, I know it's for a good reason. The phone is at 2315 Lansing Drive. - You got it. I owe you a beer when I get back. - And an apology. - That, too. - Hey Ray? Do me a favor, yeah? Try not to get killed. I don't want to be the one to explain that to Doss. - I got it, buddy. Thanks. Change of plans. Take me to 2315 Lansing Drive. - He's coming. - All right, I'm going. - Take it easy. - I'd like to apologize for what I- - Don't say it! If you say my father's name, I'm gonna come over this table and I'll fucking kill you. - I had great respect for your father. It's just a shame that his stubbornness and lack of foresight would not allow us to come to an arrangement. - For what? For your sex trafficking in our city? Yeah, we told you not to do that. We don't do that in our city. You did it anyway. So don't sit there and act like you didn't know this would come to a head, hm? You knew and you knew when we found out that there would be blood. - But not ours. - Well that can be arranged, mate. Why don't we talk- Take your fucking hands off me or you're never gonna get them back. Hey, hey, hey! - Hey, what are you doing? Hey, where are you taking him? Answer me! - Carmine Schiavone was a good man. - I told you not to say his fucking name. - He's gone. His demise has created a void in leadership. I'd like to propose a more friendlier way of solving our problems. It would be beneficial for all of us. - Fuck you! - Think about your daughter. Is this a good place to be raising a child? You hand over your father's business to me and I personally will make sure that you and your daughter are well taken care of. - You think 'cause you got us in here and you took away our guns, you think I'm gonna give you my father's legacy? - Yes, I do. - Are you sure this is where you wanna be? - This is exactly where I want to be. - If you say so. But you don't have nobody tied up in there, do you? Nevermind. Don't answer that. Uh, we don't take cash. - Well you do tonight. - Take it easy, Ray. - You jumped board and killed my father. I'm looking forward to killing you. - There is an old Japanese proverb. It means he who seeks only vengeance finds only suffering. - That's nice. I'm gonna have to remember that. You know what? There was an old Italian saying on my block growing up. It means fuck you. - Hey, you wanna stop whispering like fucking school girls and tell me when I'm gonna get outta here, otherwise I'm gonna have to kick somebody's ass. And you don't want that, believe me. All right. That's it? What the fuck too you so long? - You're welcome. - You had a gun the whole time? - I had two. - You had two guns this whole fucking time? You didn't feel that'd be useful at any point? - Where's Grant? - He's in a packaging area, okay? Which is Rooker's weird ass office. There's a lot of people between here and there. - Okay. Well what about Jada? - I don't know. They jumped us before we got too far in, but she's in the building somewhere. - Okay. I'm gonna get Grant, you find Jada, bring her to the packaging area. Think you can handle it? - What's that supposed to mean? Yeah, I can handle it. I handled this, didn't I? And why don't you go and get Jada? Wouldn't she much rather see uncle Ray-Ray before she sees me? - We're doing this my way, all right? Get Jada, bring her here. Got it? - Listen, you're not in charge. I happen to agree with the plan, but... He's gone. All right, he's gone. All right, use your stealth. Fuck, that's loud. - Is that your cavalry I hear? Whoever it is, they better be bringing in a lot of ammo. - There isn't anyone else. - We know you have bad cop Ray Rose. We know all about him. Look. He's even on time. Just say what we asked you to say on the camera then we can all go home. Look, I know you didn't like your father's business. You only went to work for him after your wife died, and you were looking for something to fill your empty, useless life. Am I right? - Don't you talk about my wife. - You just don't get the dynamic, do you? You're in no position to give me orders. - Ah! - We can put a stop to this long evening you're having, and I'm sure that your daughter is ready to go home. - Where is she? Get away from him. - We gotta get out there. - What about her? - All right, wait! - Down on your knees. - Ha, you must be the best friend. - I said get your ass down on your knees. - My sources told me that you're a DEA agent, is that correct? - This is not talk time. This is shut the fuck up time. - May I ask you a question? Are you here on official DEA business or is this just some kind of personal fucking- - Keep talking, asshole. Keep talking. Grant. Come on, buddy, get up, we gotta go. - I think your friend might need some medical assistance. You know, after the night you've had, don't think you'd wanna go back to that hospital. Oh, by the way, how's your father? - Don't test me, Rooker. - No. Nobody kills him but me. - No one else is dying tonight. You sure about this? - Hey! - Shoot him. - I don't want to. - Shot him! He's gonna take that gun off you and he's gonna shoot me and then he's probably gonna shoot you! Shoot him! - Stay back. - All right, little girl. Give me the gun. - Don't listen to him! - It's not a toy. - Jada! He'll kill me, kill you and then kill your father! - Just give me the fucking gun! - Please, mister, stop walking. This gun is no used to you. - Shoot him! - I win. - I told you that that gun was no use to you. - You little sh- - Your father should not be showing you how to use guns at your age. - I didn't learn it from daddy, doofus. I saw it on the Sopranos. - You're all right. Come on, let's get out of here. I need those bullets. - Hey, hey, hey. Don't you fucking move. - So, I guess this is where you- - No! No. - Daddy? - You're okay. - Hey. Hey, Jay-Bird. - Ray-Ray. - I bet you weren't even scared, huh? - Not a bit. How's Pops? - Hope you know your old man would be very proud of you. - Yeah, well enjoy it while you can, 'cause we got a lot of questions we're gonna have to answer. - Question? What questions are you talking about? Oh, I know he is not talking about calling the fucking cops again, is he? - Yeah, Vincent. I think he is. - Are you serious? You still wanna play Boy Scout? After everything that's fucking happened here? There are so many dead bodies in this building, lots of which you dropped. Or did you forget that? - I told you, we're doing this my way. - You sure about that, big man? Huh? - Vincent. Hey. It's over. - It doesn't have to be. - You see? You fucking need someone like me! That's what happens when you don't finish a job! - Can we go home now? - Yeah, baby. We can go home. - All of you guys go. I'm gonna stay and clean some of this shit up. I don't know about you, but after this, I'm gonna sleep like a fucking log. - Not me. I'm gonna have nightmares about devils for the rest of my life. - Oh, those stupid masks? Don't worry. There aren't any of those guys abound anymore. - What did you say? - I told her the masks weren't so scary. - Yeah, how did you know? - Shit. I shouldn't have said that, should I? - You weren't there when Pops told us that. - Oh no, no, the cop told me. The cop told me about the guys in the masks. G, we were there. - The cops didn't say anything. - He did, he told us about the guys in the masks. - He didn't say anything about masks! - Let me explain, G. Come on. - You're the only person who knew what hospital I was in. Were you a part of this the whole time? They killed my father! And they took my daughter from me, Vincent. - Son of a bitch. You told Rooker Jada was with Pops, didn't you? - Why? We treated you like family. - Like family? Like family? You treated me like a family pet. Let me tell you something G, you and your father didn't give a shit about me. The only reason I was here is because I have no bloodlines. You know, one thing that Rooker had that your old man didn't? He paid. He paid more! That's how you lost everyone! And you know what? He was gonna give me status and power. I was gonna run this whole trafficking thing. Me! Which would've been a lot better than being your fucking chauffer for the rest of my life. - You're a piece of shit. - You know what? I actually understand why you feel like that. But then you're a cop, so who gives a fuck? But me and you, G, we were close. I fucked it up. Shit! But it's okay, because the only person that really sucks for is you guys. - No! Daddy! Daddy, no. No, please don't die. - And for what? For Goody Two Shoes here who was gonna turn us all in at the end? Well, I got some good news for you G, I don't kill kids, but you know what? I think she's gonna end up an orphan anyway. And you, you fucking pig cunt. You, I'm gonna enjoy this. Shit. - Daddy? Daddy, please be okay. - I'm gonna be okay, baby. - Hey. - You're lying. - I don't wanna leave you. I never wanted to leave you. I'm gonna have to go, now, hm? But you're gonna be fine with Uncle Ray-Ray. She's gonna be fine with you, hm, isn't she, bud? - She's gonna be fine. - Why'd you do that? Why? That bullet had my name on it. Since when do you care about other people? - You're not other people, asshole. You're my brother. And you've been saving my life since I was a kid. That's why I did it. That why I did it, to protect you. I think I beat you to it. - Hey, hey, hey. Shh, Grant, please. - So, what happens now? - I don't know. But nothing bad is ever gonna happen to you. - You sound like Daddy. - Your dad wanted make sure you're safe, okay? But you're with me, always. - Are we in trouble? - No, but I have some questions that I need to answer. - Like what? - Like the importance of family and loyalty. ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪
