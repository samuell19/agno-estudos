It's only one of my favorite places. Sorry about that. - No, no harm. - But you owe me one now. So what's this about Linda? Oh. Man, we had a great time the other night. And I asked her over for dinner after the game tomorrow. And she said yes. Great. Is Linda one of your online matchmaking girls? Yes, but she's nice. A real sweetheart. Like the last one.

What happened? She stood me up. What? I called her after she was supposed to already be here, she texted me back like an hour later. Saying she couldn't make it. Shit. Really? Yeah. She said some friends came over. They hung out. What the fuck is that? So you want to get together? Do lunch or something? No. I think I'll just hang out here. You sure? Yeah. Thanks. All right then. Talk to you soon. Later. Hey, brother. How you doing? I've been wondering about you. Good. Can we get together? Yeah. Sure. When? Today. Now. Is this about that internet match girl, the nurse? No. And she's a vet, not a nurse. But it's about a woman. So I thought. What other women that are in your life? She's an old friend. She found me on Facebook the other day. A friend. We ended as friends. Started out as something more. What happened? She met someone else. Someone I knew. Someone I worked with. Ouch. When was that? 14 years ago. Haven't heard from her since. Now she wants me to come for a visit. Yeah. I know. This month. In Germany. Damn! What do you think? That's a tough one. She hurt you before, huh? You love her? Okay. You have to follow your heart, man. So what are you going to do? I don't know. And it ain't about the money. I can take a military flight over there. What do you mean? I'm retired military, if there is space available on a military flight? I can hop on. Oh. Well, that's the least of your worries, right? Only you know how you feel. Do what you have to do. But if you go, be careful. It's not the same over there as it is here. Suppose not. What about your passport? Oh man. That's right. Got a lot to think about, don't I? Hey, good morning. How are you? It's a great day. You sound good. Does this mean you're going to Germany? Indeed it does. Oh, congratulations. I guess. Congratulations works. Thanks. Feels good. Cool. You deserve it. So when? Soon as I get my kit together. Whoa, exciting. Yeah. And a bit scary. Oh, I bet. Well, let me know if you need any travel tips. Sure thing. Thanks. And don't forget to take care of your passport. Yeah. I gotta take care of that. I'll keep you posted. Thanks. Take care. I will. You know what I mean. I worry about you. Thanks. I appreciate it. Be well. You too. Take care. That's a big girl, Rosie. Yeah. You know where you're at, don't you? Knock knock. Hey, Mr. Kane. Hey, Kylie. How you doing? Okay. How are you? Just fine. Thanks. Really appreciate you watching my baby. Oh, my pleasure. She's the number one dog for sure. All her food and treats. All right. Not really sure when I'll be back. Okay. No worries, I'll take good care of her. Where are you going this time? Crossing the pond. All right. Well have fun. Will do. Hey, take care, pup. We'll be in touch. All right. Yes, can I help you? Do you know James Kane? Yes, I do. I have few questions about Mr. Kane. What's this about? What? You can't come in here. Oh yes, I can. Emma. It's a lovely place. It really suits you. I know, I'm glad I ended up here. I'm sorry to hear about Oscar. It was difficult. Well, it's a beautiful day. Let's not talk about such things. I have a surprise for you. Down this way, please. Lead the way. Wow. You remembered. Just a little thing. Just a moment. Okay. Wow. Oh, this is amazing. Have some. No, no, no. This is way too nice to eat on the street. Is your house close? Yes, just that way. All right. Let's go. So you want to play tourist today? He died in the accident. But there's more to it than that. Oscar was acting strangely before he died. Not himself. He spent so much time traveling. Sofia, Bucharest, Prague. I want you to help me forget. At least for a few days. Can you do that for me? Today was a nice day. I want to, but I just need more time. I hope you understand. Oh, hello. Where from? United States. Okay, I'm sorry. My name is Gitte. James. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. So you're staying with the mysterious Emma, right? Yes. We're old friends. How long are you staying here? I'm sorry. I have to go get the bread. You all ready to go? You can't go like that. Let me get you your costume. Did you say costume? I have to go out in public like this? Of course. It's traditional. Oh, sorry I didn't get you your shoes. I didn't know your size. Okay. But not a hat. Breakfast, Emma. Wake up, sleepy head. Emma! Emma! Emma! Oh, God. He spent so much time traveling. Sofia, Bucharest. Prague. I want you to help me forget. At least for a few days. Can you do that for me? I'm looking for somebody at this address. No no no. I'm sorry. It's important. Emma Schmitthuber. From Munich. You know her. I need your help. I must be crazy for coming here. So why did you? Emma was my friend. You knew Emma. We worked together. You know what does it mean, right? I understand. There are people you don't want to cross. I have to know what happened. Emma is dead. The rest is details. I can't leave it at that. You have history together, right? But your history is over. I speak bluntly, but it's true. Sounds like some good advice, James. You don't mind if I call you James, do you? Feel like we already know each other. You've gotten a little bit too far this time, my dear. Your Emma is dead, James. Take that as a warning. Leave Prague. Say goodbye to Lenka, James. Lenka doesn't want you to do that. Does she? Don't run, please. I need your help. I can't help you, leave me alone. You know who killed Emma. Help me find them. All right. Go there. 9:00 p.m. tonight. We can talk there. Street is not safe. He needs help. You speak English. Yes. We lived in the US for years. So what happened? I was near the old town square. Couple of guys jumped me out of nowhere. They demanded money. I just grabbed a fistful of coins. Threw it at 'em. Kind of stupid, I guess, but. Gave me a chance to run. Your daughter really saved me. Where were you staying? I'll give you a lift. No! The man might still be looking for him. Well, I don't really know. He can sleep in my room. I can sleep on the couch. Well. He can be in danger. She might be right. It seems like I've seen these guys before. It's kind of spooky. See? If it's no trouble. Okay. You look harmless enough. Morning. Nothing like a good night's sleep, huh? Good morning. She's got something to tell you. What's wrong? Tell him. I came into your room last night. And I looked at your pictures. I'm sorry. Oh, that's okay. I mean, people get curious. Happens all the time. Yeah, maybe. But she shouldn't be snooping around other people's stuff. Good point. You can get in big trouble snooping. I'm sorry. But I saw the pictures in there, and I couldn't resist. No, I totally understand. And when I recognized that man, I just kept... What did you say? I said, I saw the picture that was lying... Why do you have... No. You said you recognize that guy, right? Yes. Who is he? Tell me. Hey, hey. You're scaring her. Sorry. Who is he? He's the guy that owns the place I had my birthday party yesterday. Really. And where was that? As you wish. Nice place for a double life. I suppose you would know. But we both have a problem in those lives, don't we? And what is that? We're all alone. Your friend with the interesting hair doesn't come by here. Does he? Your friends in this life just wouldn't understand you having a goon. Goon? It is such a hard word. Well, I prefer covert assistant. Muscle, by any other name. It is a tangled web we weave. Indeed. So I imagine you worked for the West the entire time? Yes. Hence your unfortunate death when Emma was figuring it out. Must have been all your travel to the grimy underbelly of modern espionage, huh? Sometimes travel is necessary. After all, you cannot do everything by Skype and Facebook. Witness you sitting here. True enough. Control had their suspicions, they had Emma contact me. It was the only way to get you to break your cover, she always was your weak link. I loved her. So did I, and she married me. And you had her killed. No, that was business, she was getting too close to the truth. That you had to return to the decadent West. Oh, where you live your life. Only to serve the higher cause. What better way than a wolf among the lambs, right? I despise their soulless, fast-food, big box materialism. They believe in nothing, and consume the world down the toilet. They fancy themselves the guardians of freedom and democracy but all they export are hypocrisy and greed. Spare me your Jihadi bullshit. I listened to this shit for years. That's right. You don't have to listen to this, you're a lost cause, a lackey of the West, a waste of valuable air. But I'm gonna take care of that. Yeah, it's done, get me out of here. Listen to me goddamn it, I did what you told me to do. Now, get me the hell outta here. What? You gotta be kidding me. Son of a bitch! Hey, this is Evan, sorry I can't get to the phone, but you know what to do. Hey, Evan, it's me, how are you doing? I haven't heard from you, just want to make sure everything's okay. So text me or call me or Facebook me. All right. Take care. Bye. Are you Kane? Control said you could use this. You could say that. Confirmed. Confirmed. Duty calls.
