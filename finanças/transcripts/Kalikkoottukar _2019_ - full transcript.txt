Look..SK Sir.. Good morning Sir..Where are you going in a hurry? To the class? No.. Going to the toilet..Coming with me? What is the dirty stench? He just left some gas.. But, why does it smell like ganja? He is like that Sir.. Sometimes it smells like ganja and sometimes liquor Sometimes, it could be just that of toddy.. -And sometimes..-Enough... Very good..What wisdom!! And what a knowledge about gases..!! I know what to do with you all... -Write fast. Sir is coming -Ok Your handwriting is very good Where did we stop yesterday? Clean development management -What is it... early in the morning? -There is a circular This is an awareness circular For the attention of students.. Drugs are cancer cells that kill the society.. And it is the duty of the society to defend it The number of people who get attracted to it, and end up in a miserable and painful life, are increasing day by day.. In India, Kerala has become second only to Amritsar in reported cases of drug abuse.. In 2017 only, drugs worth 304 crores were confiscated from 50000 cases!! And unknown cases may be still more Terminal punishment could be given to those who are caught and punished for drug abuse, a second time It is the duty of every citizen who loves our country ... to inform the police if they get to know of drug peddling Ok Just to tell you all something. Be careful now .. you won't be sorry in future.. Have you all updated your notes? You are smart!! How could you do this? Different pages..different handwritings!! This is a rare talent ,some people attain!! Handwriting changes everyday!! You are a wonder-kid!! Tell me frankly..Whose handwriting is this? Truly..I don't remember Sir Quite natural!! One gets confused with different pages!! Tell me ..Otherwise, I will find out.. Then,you will get it from me. Tell me..Whose is this? And then..Whose is this? What about this? Your notebook doesn't have your handwriting? -Yes sir.. -Where is it? Here. Sir At last, he saw his own handwriting in his own note book!! Just half a page That too, like some doctor's prescription What is it..Dude? You were destined to become a doctor, Is it? Our folks are fortunate enough! You know how many lives you saved by not becoming a doctor? Sir..Since long, many of his notes are written by us.. -So..you know him since long? -Yes Sir We six were together from the lower KG itself Six? Who are all they? We all, Sir Sir..He is more interested in arts and sports.. He is the house captain too He is crazy about movies as well.. Oh..That too?? Yes Sir..We acted together in two films.. Which ones? Anandabhairavi and Athisayam Teachers give him charge for all the programmes So that their efforts is less Then... How does he get time to write notes? Ok..Got it..But I have a doubt Then, who writes the exam? He writes himself..and passes How do you pass?...Tell me What is the secret? No secret Sir.. He learns in half an hour that I take six hours to learn That is the secret But, Anand, if you have to improve your handwriting, you have to write So, from tomorrow onwards, show me your notes.. In your own handwriting Listen to me What are you doing? This is no time for pranks.. Move aside I will spank you..Move aside You come here Move aside You come here Listen to the mudras.. Very good.. Who are you to take photographs? Get out Taking photographs of girls to spoil the event!!Idiot!! So you was sitting here! -What happened to you? -Bullshit!! Don't get angry..Tell me what happened? You are so happy when Aysha took my place ..Is it? I am happy whoever it is.. you, Aysha or anyone else Oh..How many are there to make you happy?! Have you gone crazy? How does it matter to you with whomever I dance? You are right.. Why should I get tensed if you dance with anyone? I am observing a change in you since some days.. I got out of mood, somehow Bawa.. What is it ,Grandpa? Did you see this? Do you know him? Who is this guy? Let me see Let me see.. Who is he? I know him quite well.. I have seen him somewhere My God..I can't recollect!! Yes..Got it.. grandpa..Athisayan I know him since long..He is too smart! How do you know him? We acted in a movie together before I went for Haj. Athisayan During the shooting, he used to go and sit next to her After every shot, goes and sits next to Aysha Why? To exchange sweet nothings..What else? Is it true ..My Lord! Yes..Grandpa..He is not just a lad..He is terrible How terrible? A romantic terrorist.... Be careful or she will elope with him What.. Yes..Our Aysha Oh...My Lord.. Will it be an issue? Greetings How are things? -Everything going on fine.. -Really? Come Hydros.. What is it, Papa? Did you see this? -All of you stay outside-Okay What is all this,Papa? This was sent by Aflan, son of Mehroob Who is this guy? Son of S I Rajmohan, who lost his legs in a bike accident Bawa.. Did Aysha come back from college? -Yes -Call her Aysha What is it, Papa? What am I seeing here? Oh..This one..How did you get this? These are Onam celebrations rehearsal photographs... Who told you to remove the veil? My Grandpa..The veil doesn't match with our Kerala attire Answer the question.. Noone told me Papa..I did it myself You are not a little girl now.. Not only that..You know who you are? You are the granddaughter of Veliyitath Ummer haji Don't let it grow into a scandal From tomorrow onwards..wear a purdah when going to college It is pitiable..Grandpa College is not air condititoned.. I will get scorched in heat.. Grandpa will tell...and my darling will obey.. Papa..er.. Don't answer me back..Go.. What a pity!! Each day's quarrels should be settled on that day itself. Haven't I told you? That is over He came to me.I got wild and told him things frankly..Openly I feel like seeing him always ..only him Even when I look at the book or the blackboard... ... his face is what comes to me.. His smile, his mannerisms Enough..This is the beginning of romance.. I am sure.. I used to have this long ago..With your father Correct..You said it Then, what is your opinion if I fall in love with him and marry him? Did he say that he loved you? No..That is not a problem..I will make him say that Is he attached to someone else? No..I am sure Mummy..You didn't say anything Whatever..I think it is not good Why not? If couples of same age get married, ..there could be issues after some years.. What sort of an issue? By the time girls attain 45 years .. they start losing charm.. due to child birth and all that And men even at 45, look really smart and glamorous.. And then sometimes? Sometimes? They might jump over the fence.. In my opinion, there should be an age difference of at least ten years So..Mummy says Anand might go with some other girls .. after some years..Is it? I didn't say that..But there is a possibility He won't do that And if he does that, I will chop off his genital and feed dogs.. Now you became totally crazy.. You got crazy..not me What sort of nonsense you are belching out?? That is the recent trend, Dear Don't you read newspapers? There would be at least one news ... about someone's genitals getting cut Girl friend does this to boy friend..

Here is she!!!..Looks like P T Usha arriving.. I was a state athlete.. You sure look like that.. Aysha ,Just a sec.. You look beautiful in the Purdah I can see a lot of kafirs flying around you Don't be friendly with them..it will create problems You have friends from our folk..then what?

Not a joke.. I am very serious..Listen I am not a new born baby.. I know what is right and what is wrong I don't need your study classes And..If you try to harasss me, I will hit you back...Idiot.. How was my performance? You are like a cheetah... Fried him ..Right? Where is Lakshmi? She was right here.. Aysha is my friend..If she asks me, I will do it.. Lakshmi..An Iyer girl from Palakkat..Understand.. What is the problem? So you thrashed him without an issue? She is my friend..When I knew that he troubled her I gave him whatever he needed I can wait to know about the issue.. Tell me..What was the issue.. He is related to her.. Relative or not..these things require immediate retort You are too good.. Let me get my bag Is she a female? Yes..I am sure How do you know that? I too had a doubt. But confirmed it in the bathroom Too smart!! -What is the problem? Tell me. It is time for class Come. I will tell you Look..I like you You start liking me only now? I like you from lower KG itself. Not that, Dude....This is another sort of liking You think you are in love with me? Shall we think seriously about our marriage? Tell me frankly..Don't you love me? I am beautiful..

I just can't think of a marriage or even being in love I have to finish my course ..then get a job Then only I can repay the housing loan Dummy legs for my Dad..I have no other dreams When we were small, your mom used to tell my mom That when she grows up, give her to us. Myself and Anand will look after her well If your mother were alive today... I wouldn't have been in this pathetic situation.. Now I understand that you are getting away from me.. I want to know why...Tell me I am a little darker than you, Is it? Nope... Then?. I am not as tall as you? 6ft1 inch? Right? If you were 6ft 1 in.. You would have been looking gorgeous!!! Like a giraffe!! Tell me frankly... Are you in love with someone else? If so? I wil kill her What did you say? I will kill her... for sure Now I am sure.. That I am crazy? You better understand that Anand..Are you not attending the class? Yes sir..You go ahead, Sir What is your programme? We were just discussing about new software I got it when she opened her eyes... First, try to pass the exam..Dude You are happy now, right? What is that now? First ..You try to learn how to kill a cockroach.. Everything can come later How smart these guys are!!! You will spoil my reputation ..Is it? Anand.. Where did he go? He left about ten minutes back. Seems there is a special class today He left without telling me..? I said I would call you..

Two bangles and the wedding chain Sell one bangle, keep some money for our expenses The balance amount, you pay the bank.. What happened to you today, Dad? -Mummy came into your memory?-Hmm What a cursed destiny we have, Dad!! Even now, you don't suspect anyone? All criminals were my enemies when I was in service Out of them, whom can I suspect? Even now, I can't believe it was an ordinary accident I will grieve till I get at the truth.. Power outage!..Who knows when it will come again Even God wouldn't know that Sing me that old lullaby ..in anadabhairavi A lullaby Now..What do you want ?

He might get me a dismissal Things look like out of our control.. What happened? Case could not be charged against him. The DYSP released him And gave him certificate that he is innocent CM and DGP has interfered in this. I don't understand why I heard DGP was being asked to reopen the old accident case.. Try to pay him something and settle the case Not possible. He is a very straightforward person. Let him enquire the case. He may even find the truth But, if the case has to go to court where are the evidences? Even his dead father can make it.. I am sure about that Still...Be careful What if someone notices this number? The number of this vehicle actually belongs to a vehicle in the workshop since a month It will take another one month for that vehicle to come out of workshop After our requirement, this vehicle will use the original number and go for trips.. That is it..Simple It is time for him to come.. Wear the mask There..they are going..Take the vehicle Today his wife is also with him.. Let them get ruined..two birds in one shot..

I am Lakshmi ,an Iyer girl from Palakkat They are all my friends Iyer girl..I like your boldness. Why you are telling to everyone that you are Iyer girl? Otherwise he will think I will be a tribal woman That’s right. You have much resemblance You get lost Don't you feel angry at the policemen who thrashed you up like this? Yes Then, why did you say there was no complaint? What can you do if I give a complaint? I would have taken serious actions.. What action Sir? Just a transfer Or, just a suspension..that is all Can you return just one blow that I got? Can't.. Is it? Suspension would be just for six months, at the most He will get half the salary sitting at home If he can influence a politician ... he can again get into service easily.. And gets the remaining half of the salary I have nothing to say Anand..Let me ask you something Why do SI Suseelan and the other policemen .. have such a vengeance on you? I will tell you, Sir Not just that, Anand just a month before SI Rajmohan's accident, ... drugs worth 6 crores were confiscated on road checking I know Sir Two culprits were caught on that day, out of three They are in central jail now on a 11year term But, one guy escaped...

Vikram who trapped you in Goa..Venpala Vikram When I knew that he was behind this, ...I joined the two guys who are in jail I gave them opportunities to make phone calls.. and I recorded that I am sure..It was not an accident.. We will find the culprits soon But the court will ask for evidences.. It is not easy to collect evidences Even if there are evidences, it will not reach the court, Sir Drug mafia is a huge racket, Anand There are even political leaders and criminal officials with them Don't we have laws to shoot them dead like in some other countries? Sir No? We need such laws to save our country Otherwise poor citizens of this country ... ...will have to live a life of slavery under them My 19 year old body was smashed by them Till yesterday, I was too sensitive and soft hearted..But Today..My mind has the power of steel.. I can face anything It is good to be enthusiastic and confident.. But you should be very careful There will be several forces to support the enemies.. ...and you are very young too Thank you very much a lot.. Sir, for saving me from this trap.. Almost over..Shouldn't I come? Ok Where is Anand, Sir? He hasn't reached home yet? No Sir You said you would drop him at home.. But he said he doesn't need that.. He didn't contact you till now? No Sir He came to meet me at the hostel, but left immediately Why did he come.. He said it is urgent and took my ATM card How much was there in that? About a lakh of rupees Is it the airport officer Sir, I am Gafur DYSP I want an info urgently Just to know if a boy called Anandraj, 19 years old ..boarded a domestic flight after 10 AM today Excuse me Sir..Please check the Goa flight first I can wait..Thank you, sir If my guess is right, he has gone to Goa Can you give me his mobile number His phone was damaged at the police station, Sir I have given one of my phones to him..for me to call Give me the number 9946159198 I tried in that..But can't get him..
