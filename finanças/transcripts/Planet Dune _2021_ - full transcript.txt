Hey! The freighter's ready for lift-off! The team's all loaded up! I'm all set! Something messed with my latest reading, though. You guys mess with my equipment again? Whatever. I think we have everything we need. Copy that. Wheels up soon. Couldn't come at a moment too soon. The O2 levels are starting to look off. I don't like the looks of ol' smokey over there. Oh, yeah. Let's get outta here before she blows her top, huh? All right. Calling base. Let's hit it. Yeah. Space Force, this is IMC Five. Crew is all packed in, ready to come on home. Affirmative, IMC Five, you are clear for return. Safe journey home, boys. Mayday! Mayday! This is IMC Five! We are experiencing seismic activity! Come in, base! Bryant! Ah! Chase, this is Space Force Rescue Unit 4A proceeding to pull out stalled transport shuttle from the main flyway, over. That's Captain Chase and you are not yet cleared for your maneuver, Lieutenant Young. With all due respect, Captain, how much longer is this babysitting gonna last? Well, as long as you have problems following commands, Lieutenant. Yes, Captain, but surely you have better uses for your best pilot trainee? I still haven't decided if you're my best trainee or my worst. I outmaneuvered everyone in class every session, ma'am. Sounds like she is your best pilot. Hmm. When she obeys orders. Which is why Lieutenant Young is going to pass probation by adhering to standard operating procedure, correct, Astrid? I'm here to color inside the lines, Captain. Ah, see that you do. Show me you can follow commands, and then I'll put you back on the wait list for Squad 1A, I promise. You're gonna slow-roll me to get back on that rescue team 'til I'm dead. Repeat transmission, Astrid. I did not copy. I said, "Copy, ma'am." Captain. Lieutenant Young, there is an urgent distress call portside 32 degrees, quad 86, 40 miles. Russian solar farm "Zolotse" reports a failed spacewalk on its starboard side. Captain, you hearing this? Astrid, this is Major Hawkins. The solar farm is Russian jurisdiction only. You heard the Major. Stay the course. Let the Russians handle their own rescue. Our 1A Class Rescue ship is prepped for launch if they're needed. But the solar farms are usually a one-man operation. You are to focus on the shuttle, not the cosmonaut! Status update. Spacesuit Oxygen readings have triggered a biometrics APB. Cosmonaut Vasily Petrakov is in distress. His air regulator is breached. Oxygen is depleting rapidly, 58% remaining. Captain, the shuttle has plenty of air in reserves. There's not a Russian ship anywhere near. Even if Team 1A gets off the launch pad in the next minute, this Petrakov will be dead! Status update. Cosmonaut oxygen level is at 16%. 1A is cleared for rescue. 5A is within 40 kilometers of the target. Okay, Chase. Has 1A left the launch paid? They will in t-minus five minutes. All right, I got no choice. Astrid... That man will die out there! Astrid, you are veering off-course. Turn your ship around and stand by! I'm sorry, Chase! No! I can't leave a man to die! You know the protocol! That man is not your concern! The shuttle is! Mayday, mayday! I have no air. Please help me. Mayday! Mayday! He knows his people won't reach him in time! He's broadcasting in English! Central Command, I have no air. Send help. Major Hawkins, I am "go" for the Russian cosmonaut! 4A, this is in direct violation of the international rules of engagement. Team 1A has priority clearance. Abort mission. Major, I'm sorry. Transmission's cutting out! Losing radio signal! Intel! Cosmonaut status log! Oxygen level, 11%. Deactivate hazard avoidance system. I need full control to be able to reach this solar farm. Hazard avoidance steering deactivated. G-force stress factor 4.2. Current trajectory collision warning, solar farm. Retrograde portside! 40%! Intel, prepare decompression for the cosmonaut. Engage robotic arm to pull him in. Rescue mission accomplished! Lieutenant Young, report to the Command Satellite immediately! You are to surrender to the MPs upon arrival. Yes, sir. Alert! Astrid, you are wanted by military law enforcement. Yeah, I know, Intel. Thank you. Why'd you have to be Russian? Military Police is en route. Give me your tracking device and your biometric beacon. This is exactly what got you into trouble last time. You know what happened. I shielded that crew from the debris. No one cares. You caused an accident and lost your ship and lost all credibility. I was saving lives, ma'am. You know what? Even as far back as flight school, you were a pain. And I kept telling myself, I kept thinking no, no, no. Keep training her, she's a promising pilot. I really believed in you. Chase... Captain, I had to. We are not fighter pilots and, as a rescue flight division, we work for the military. You know what that means? That means this is my career, too. We don't even know who the cosmonaut is. We don't even know if he's KGB. I can't stop them from arresting you. You were gonna save him with the other ship! I don't see a difference! You don't see the difference? Well, the difference is they have clearance with foreign nationals. You don't. You broke military law by disobeying a direct order and an international treaty of zero engagement between Russian and American forces! He saw the inside of a Space Force Rescue ship, not a combat craft! You don't get to decide if that's important. You know... I covered for you the last time, the last incident. But this is really too much. There's gotta be some other option than locking me away. What about a rehabilitation program? No. I called in all my favors last time. You are a great pilot, but I can't make that case to Command anymore. Okay. Would I qualify for Education-Based Discipline? Hard labor beats the brig. Ma'am, you don't owe me anything. But if I go to prison, that's a waste of my talent and your training. If you refer me to a labor assignment in the penal system, I promise you I will repay you! If I request a labor program, you're gonna be flying an F-level tugboat and doing community service. Okay, so it's an MOLV-One ship? Yes, the lowest class there is and it's a dangerous assignment. And, Astrid, you'll be working crew with other criminals. Wait. I can't fly alone? No, not anymore. Okay, I understand. Major Hawkins, this is Captain Chase requesting a labor assignment. Go for Hawkins. Yes. Former Lieutenant Young is waiving her right to a hearing. And is requesting a hard labor assignment commensurate to the charges. I'll have the hearing officer draw up the paperwork. She can start today, Captain. There's a tug ship scheduled at 1700. The freighter? Okay. You're in. I think you might change your mind about prison when you meet the crew. Ma'am, seriously, I will repay you. You are going to another solar system on a last-tier assignment, dead last, desert planet. Planet Dune? It's a freighter lift from the surface. It's a six-crew members. They reported mechanical problems when they had takeoff. And then we lost contact. We're gonna send you in to check and rescue. Ma'am, seriously, I'm in your debt. Go get your new uniform. Get your ship dock number and report to me at 1630. - Thank you so much. - Go, go. Astrid, meet your new crew. What's up? You must be Astrid. Your reputation precedes you. Like it's tattooed on my forehead. Trying to change that, though. Sure. I'm ship's mechanic. There's nothing I can't fix... unless it gets broken by a reckless pilot. Good thing we don't have one of those around here then. You disobeyed a flight directive and lost your ship, right? No, my engine went out when I was saving someone's life. That's why you're here giving guided tours to cosmonauts. Okay, let's get something straight... Cool your jets. This is the only crew you have now. Hey, there. I'm Ronnie, your navigator. Nice to meet you. I know you. Oh, yeah. My face was all over the interstellar coms. Took 'em forever to catch me. They said, "Prison or Risky Probation Flights"? So I said, "Give me Flights." Hey, a great navigator can get out of anywhere. It's like a daredevil rescue pilot, right? Yeah, well, at least you're free now. I wouldn't say that. I've got this lovely keepsake. Can't wander too far from home. Well, shall we? Brad! Sorry. What'd I miss? Nothing at all. I was just introducing your pilot. I'm Brad, tug line operator. If it's stuck, I unstick it. Everyone, this is Astrid Young, former Lieutenant of the Space Force Rescue Division and one of our greatest assets. Unfortunately, one of our greatest liabilities also. But, fortunately, I believe in rehabilitation and not in punishment. So don't let me down. Skis up at 1700. Well, you heard her. Let's load up. That's our ship? I thought I was being punished. All right. Crew up here. Yo, Astrid! Uh... Lieutenant. Oh, that's how it's gonna be? Okay... Lieutenant. Gear's all stowed and crew is buckled up. Flight crew, prep for liftoff. Don't look so worried. We know what we're doing, "Lieutenant Young". MOLV One, you are clear for take off. Be advised, we are getting reports of an asteroid debris field near your route. Stay safe. Copy that. Gear up. Ahead one-quarter. Course laid in. At full. Nice takeoff, pilot. No, seriously, they gave us the most raggedy piece of garbage... Yeah, it's not that bad. It'll get us there. We'll be lucky if someone doesn't sneeze and blow a hole through the hull. All right, Ronnie. If you don't need me up here, I'm gonna go on ahead and mosey down to the engine room and give it a once-over. - Yeah, just make sure... - Uh, make it quick. I expect a full debrief on return. Will do, boss. It's Lieutenant. Lieutenant Boss. Okay, are we gonna have a problem here? I get the feeling we're gonna have a problem! - Well, maybe. - There's no problem right? Happy crew, happy ship, right? I don't think the guy who steals ships with his tow line should tell the rest of us - how to run our ship! - I was broke. I needed the money. A lot of people go broke, but they don't go on... - Asteroids! - Bring up the map! This ship's tracking lidar is crap! Yeah. We're three degrees off-course. I can reroute us manually. Damn it! We have damage, starboard side! Wait, why are we in an asteroid field? How'd that happen? Astrid? Yeah, I'm a little busy right now! I'm losing pressure! Rebecca? On it! All right, pressure's leveling! We have damage on the starboard side. More good news. The landing gear is toast! Oh, that's fine. We can just use the landing skis instead of the wheels. Skis? The surface is sandy. We can glide on in. Clear field. Clear field? Our new pilot here didn't even realize we were approaching an asteroid field. The Lidar's faulty. We were having troubles with it on the last run, too. Someone didn't fix it, Rebecca. You know I haven't had a chance... Okay, Rebecca! It's nobody's fault, all right? We were three degrees off-course! Clearly, nothing works well on this rig! You all handled yourselves well. Well, at least this time, it wasn't your fault. You better check yourself, civilian! We got a long road to walk together! What? You wanna go? Hmm? Well, at least we're all in one piece, right? It's good enough for me. Assess the damage on the hull. Find out what got knocked loose. Brad, get this rig cleaned up. What is her deal? Rebecca doesn't like anybody. Yeah, no. I got that. I seem to be special, though. She is fifth-generation Space Force. Entire family is military, by the book. You come here, Miss Poster Child for "regulations don't mean jack". Just breeze in, the gifted one. Yeah, okay. I got it. How'd she wind up here? I don't know. I do know that she's pretty ticked off that you just got away with a little slap on the wrist for breaking military protocol. What? This is a slap on the wrist? Yeah, compared to what it could have been, yes. You have friends in high places. Well, not high enough. Yeah. Watch me try and wreck a ship and get away with it. Fair enough. You just need to keep your nose clean for the next few days. And then it's back to being Lieutenant Hero. It's not like that. You could have fooled me. What do I know? Spent most of my time in the brig. Hey, can I ask what you did? You can ask. I'm gonna go check out the ship. Something somewhere is broken down, I guarantee it. Beginning descent to Planet Dune, engaging orbital boosters. Gravity assist is slowing our trajectory. Copy. Okay, Rebecca, how's it looking? Still getting a damage reading, but the skis are intact. Okay, Brad, stand by. Anchor standing by! All right, everyone, hold what you got. I'm gonna set us down as close to this freighter as possible. We come in, we come out. Reminds me of my last job. Isn't that how you wound up on this one? I can neither confirm nor deny that. The air's too obscured from that smoke from the volcano. I can't get a reading. Atmosphere's bouncing back the lidar. All right. We'll have to do it the old-fashioned way. Clear the coverage and set her down. Easy. We don't wanna wheelbarrow. I know. Increasing back pressure and power. The planetary profile says that the atmosphere's totally clear. Yeah. Since when has Space Force been right about anything? Caught your ass, didn't they? I have visuals and reading! 500 feet! Reconfiguring flap settings from 30 to 40 degrees! Coming in hard! Landing gear skis down! All right, Brad! Go! On it! Tow system is go! Droppin' anchor! Good job, everyone. Let's find this freighter and get outta here. I thought it was supposed to be winter here. It is. Hang on, guys. It's too hot. It is hot! Yeah. I think it's gonna blow soon. Then we hurry. Careful! I don't see the freighter. It's supposed to be here. We probably overshot the landing. Hang on. There's a trail over here. Straight through the sand, like it was dragged. No, a ship that big can't be dragged without a tow line. Stay sharp, guys. I see it! Over there! Perfect... We'll be skis up in an hour. Hang on, guys. Stop! Yes, "Lieutenant"? Something's not right. What? I don't see anything wrong. There's no one outside. They're supposed to be on the lookout for us. Well, they're probably inside, away from this heat... like we should be. No. You don't understand. When a rescue ship arrives, they should fire a flare gun or send a ground crew to meet us. There's no one even waving us in. It's a six-man crew, Lieutenant. If there's people hurt, there is no ground crew. We have seen no one! That is a bad sign! Guys, we don't even know why it's so far from the landing zone. Maybe some of your Russian friends showed up to lend a hand? They're not my friends! And I'm the only one violating treaties lately! Well, it's just them on the planet, right? So what could have happened? We're gonna find out. We gotta be ready for anything. So stick close, work fast. You got it, boss. IMC Five, this is MOLV One, your rescue ship. Come in. Over. IMC Five, this is MOLV One, do you copy? Not good. Okay, let's just see what we're dealing with. We'll check on the crew and we'll move the tug ship closer. Brad? Rebecca? You guys get a tow line going. Ronnie and I will move into position. We gotta hurry. Oxygen's dropping faster than I'd like. It's only minus 10% of what's normal on earth. It's like a mid-altitude hike, easy-peasy. There's an active volcano less than 15 miles away. And we do know what we're doing. We've been working together before you showed up... Okay, if we keep dragging our feet, we're gonna keep losing oxygen. I'm just saying, maybe we should go back and get the spare oxygen... Okay, listen, listen, okay? We gotta stick together on this! We might have an answer once I fire off this flare. You gotta be kidding me. It's a family heirloom! That better be water in there. What is that? Gasoline? Okay. It's moonshine, but it was a gift from my mom before she died! Really? Mama's moonshine? Yeah. My great-great-grandmother was a shine runner back in Prohibition. So what? That's nice. Were you drunk flying us here? No, I wasn't drunk! But you were drinking, right? I had a drink, okay? What? I knew when I read the dossier you must have been hammered when you wrecked your ship! Okay, I wasn't hammered, all right? I had just saved a ship's crew and I saw debris flowing from their craft heading toward the I.S.S. So, yeah, I disobeyed orders and I deflected it and I burned out my engine. And then I had a drink, one drink, to calm down after! Did you need to calm down after the asteroids? No, I didn't. Thanks for your concern. This says otherwise. Guys, I don't even need that! Oh, good! Then you won't mind if I pour this out. No, go right ahead! Go! Run! Run! A cave, come on! Well, what now, Lieutenant? Guess we know what happened to the freighter crew. No, we don't know anything. There could still be survivors out there. We need to get off this planet. No. We need to find the survivors! Then we go. Well, we can't go back out there. Looks like we'll be in here for a while. What if it can burrow under the rock and get in here? Yeah, that's a good point. There could be worms inside. We just don't know. Does anyone have any weapons on them? It's not much, but it's better than nothing. Against that worm? You know, if it could have come over the rocks, it would have followed us in. So we should be safe in here, for now at least. Okay, I say we go deeper in and maybe there's another way out. What if we find something else in here, something worse? I'm having a real problem with worse. Something that had to outrun the worm and it got stuck here and it's hungry too? You have a point. I think it can probably still detect us 'cause we're so close to the entrance. - We should move. - Ronnie's right. It could be trying to find another way in as we speak. Let's go find another way out! Go, go, go. - Okay. - All right. Hey... What was that? - Was that a person? - Is somebody there? I'm not sure. - Watch your six. - You got it. Can you hear me? Careful. Brad, you see anything? Who's that? Help! I'm here! Help! Come on! Help! Hey, you okay? Do you have water? Water, water, water, water! Are you hurt? I think I broke my leg. The worm was chasing me. I fell into this rock. Yeah. We had a few words with him too. What uniform is that? It's, uh... Public Services. We're with the tug ship crew. That smarts. Yeah? Kills the germs. Look, I don't think it's broken, but be careful putting weight on it. Where's the rest of your crew? I don't know. We scattered. My girl, Marilyn, and the rest ran to the rocks in the east and I made it here. The worm's directly beneath us! Oh! We gotta get off this rock! Your leg's really gonna hurt when we do this. I don't care. Just get me out of here! It's pushing the rocks aside! Um, I'll jump across. You hand him to me. Go! It's trying to get through the rocks! Harley, step out and reach for Astrid on the other side. I got you here. Let's go! You guys, we can't stay here. Okay, you ready? Wait, wait. Look. No, no, no, no, we gotta go back out the way we came. No, there's a small tunnel over that I crawled in through. with some light. There's probably an exit. Well, do you know how to get there? - Yes, I... - Shh! Okay. Here we go. It's there. Okay. Okay, I think we're good. Shh! Run! Wait, wait, wait. I need a minute to rest. We're not stopping, are we? We almost died back there. Shh! Do you want to live? - You? - Yes. Then stay quiet and calm. We're gonna have a tough time finding everyone and getting off this planet. How many do you think made it from your crew? I was the only one who made it to the cave, probably three more. Okay, do you have any weapons? No. We're a mining rig. Well, what's the plan? We get to the freighter and get out of here. The Corrections Department gave us explicit orders! What about his crew? We can't just leave them here. No, no, no. We'll rescue the crew. We were sent to rescue the freighter. That includes the crew. It's too risky without backup, Astrid! You need to think clearly. I'm not leaving these people stranded on a ridge to die! Isn't this what got you in trouble in the first place? Disobeying orders to play hero? As I said, I am not disobeying orders. We are bringing home the freighter. That means the crew, too! We are a rescue team! End of discussion! Oxygen levels are down five percent. - That's not good! - Same. Dropping. It's the volcano. There are vents on the side that's releasing carbon dioxide and toxic fumes. Okay, okay. This cave is a death trap. We got to get out of here, come on. Let's go. Our friend is back! There's the freighter! Oh, thank God! Okay, Ronnie? Rebecca? You guys get it ready for launch. Brad and I will go to the ridge and look for survivors. Okay. And the worm? It can't chase both of us. Just run like hell. Uh, ladies? He's okay. He's just passed out. We can't travel with dead weight! Okay, Brad. You stay here with Harley and I'll come back with the tug for you. - I'll stay. - All right. - Time to go, ladies. - Yeah. We're gonna have to make a run for it. What about the worm, Lieutenant? It's more important that you guys get to the freighter. I'll keep him busy. I'll go first. Wait... She's insane. Let's go. All right. Hello? Anyone? This is rescue! Hello? Oh, God. Coming. Are you okay? Water... I got you. Whoa, slow slips! Easy does it. I'm Astrid. Marilyn. You injured? No. Just... Thirsty and hungry. Here. I'm so glad you're here. - Here. Try this. - Thanks. Is there anyone else with you? No. They tried to make it to the freighter. But it... the worm... it was waiting for them. I'm sorry. Look, we can't stay here. We gotta get to my tug. - Can you travel? - No. No, we can't. They're too fast. Whoa, hang on, they? There's more than one worm? Four that I've seen. Four... Ronnie, Rebecca and Brad, this is Astrid. Come in. MOLV One! This is Astrid! There are at least four worms out there, guys! I repeat, multiple worms! Over! I think we're in the clear. - I don't hear it. - I hope Astrid made it. ...More than one... More than one? Go! Go! Go! We're almost to the freighter! Ronnie, repeat that transmission! Okay, look. Tell me everything you know about these worms. I've been using a telemetric scanner. The worms... they feed on trace amounts of iron in the sand. Okay, okay. Then we arrived? Yes. They can smell the iron in our blood. But there's iron in the ships! Right, but not in the form they can use. Okay, okay, all right. What else? There's one big one and three smaller ones. I think they're babies. They follow the big one around at times. Go on. Look, any information can help us. The big one... he... he grabbed the freighter. He attacked the freighter. And he just dragged it across the desert. I mean, we didn't stand a chance. Brad, this is Astrid! Maintain your position. I repeat, stay in the cave! Here. Try this. Come on, take this. - What is that? - It'll take the edge off. Wow, that burns like... Like rocket fuel? Yeah. It's actual moonshine. My grandma made it. Go ahead, have a swig. You, uh... you could use it. What is this doing on a ship? Isn't this contraband? More or less. It's all I have left of my parents, though. Your parents made homemade booze? Kind of a family legacy all the way back to prohibition. Hell, your great-great grandfather probably even had our stuff. Oh, that's bad. It's an acquired taste. I'm sorry. I think I drank the last of it. Not exactly. Should I be concerned? No. I told you, it's a family legacy. It's the last batch they made before... My mom sent this to me as a present when I graduated from flight school. Last thing she ever sent me. Anyway, I didn't want it to be confiscated, so I hid it. Maybe I should just hang on to it. I'm good. We gotta go. No, we can't! The worms... we can't. Ronnie? Rebecca? Have you reached the freighter? Over. We can't get any signal up here. I need to get to higher ground. No... There. We can run to that taller rock and I'll radio from there. Marilyn, come on! We can't stay here, okay? We're running out of water and the air's getting thinner! Marilyn, we gotta go. Marilyn, we gotta get to higher ground so I can radio the crew, okay? I got two in your freighter standing by. I got one more in a cave over those rocks with a survivor from your team. They're all waiting on us to get off of this planet. Another survivor? Who? Harley... Harley? He's okay? He didn't die? Yeah. Yeah, no, no. He's a tough guy. Okay? Here. Left foot up. You good? Hang on, listen. I don't hear the worms. This could be our best chance. You ready? Let's go. - Ah! - What? I got you! What about this one? I'm not dying like that. Not like that. Almost makes me want to get back in the brig. Seriously? Oh, yeah. Hell of a lot safer. Okay, you need to get this engine up and running. We don't even know what's wrong with it. That's your job. It's right below us! It's following us. Keep moving! Everything looks the same. Where are we? - Headed towards the engine room. - Great. If you can't fire up the ship, I say we cut our losses and run for the tug ship. No. We stay and fix the freighter. Did you feel that? I say we just leave it! No! I want this ship! What do you mean, you want this ship? I'm with IMC. I don't care who you work for. Besides, I thought you were an ex-con. That's why I'm here. This thing is worth $300 billion and my cut is $100 million, all right? If you help, I'll give you 20%. You in? Look, it can't hurt us in here. I say we save the people and the freighter. I'm not interested in the people. I want the money. Well, we can save the crew on the rocks, too. Be my guest! Fine, but if it comes down to a choice, I'm ditching the freighter! Sure. The crew outside would love some company! Huh. What do you mean, "huh"? Let's go. Well, I got partial power back, but the diagnostic says the intake ports need to be cleared from underneath the ship. If not... If not, the ship won't start. They're under the ship, aren't they? If we clear them from inside the ductwork, you won't be exposed to the outside. No, when I was in the brig I mapped out the entire ventilation system... Wait, wait. Why? I had a lot of time on my hands, But if I get inside the vents, it's gonna put me five feet above the sand. I don't wanna be that close to the sand. So what do we do? Just give up and run to the tug ship? No. I can try to clear them using the exhaust system in the HVAC room. Okay, yeah. That'll work! - Radio me once it's done. - Okay. Rebecca! The worm is in the ship! Repeat! Worm is in the ship! Ronnie! Get out of there! The heater's on, I can't shut it off! I know! Hit max power on the heat exhaust! You'll be burned alive! Do it! Ronnie, come in! Damn it, Ronnie! Come in! This is Rebecca! Come in! Just had to be a primary switch. Can't start the engine without the primary switch. Ronnie, come in! Anyone! I need backup! Okay. I'm gonna have to go outside. No wonder it wouldn't start. The landing severed the external power line. Ah! Rebecca, nice work! Two down. - Two? - I got one, too. Yeah, but we just doubled our repair time. How many worms are there? I don't know. I only saw the one. For the record, I'm impressed. I just did what needed to be done. Exactly right. That's why I'm gonna give you a cut. You're a good team player. First time anyone's ever said that about me. All right. Let's get the rig running and get outta here. What about the others? What about them? They make it back here, great. If not... Are we clear on this? Yeah. All right. Check the conduits in that panel. We got a lot of work ahead of us. This should be good. You okay? Yeah. I think I twisted it. I didn't notice the pain then, but it's killing me now. All right. Get your boot off. All right. Okay? All right. This should keep the swelling down. Okay. All right, the tug should be just right over there. I'm gonna piggyback my signal off its antenna, radio home base. My captain should be able to send help. Is that the same captain that sent you to this death planet? She didn't know. Neither did you. Mayday, Space Force! This is MOLV One pilot, Astrid Young. Do you copy? Space Force, this is MOLV One. Mayday! Do you read me? Copy, MOLV One, This is Space Force. We read you. We need immediate backup rescue and fire power. We are not alone here! Space Force, do you copy? We need help! We read you, Lieutenant. Chase... uh, Captain! This is a secure line. Define the full nature of the emergency. Is this a Russian incursion? Russians? What... You just indicated there was a hostile force and requested backup and fire power. No, ma'am, it's not Russians! It's worms, giant worms! We need rescue now! We don't have the capability to fight them! I'm sorry, but I'm not authorized to send a retrieval ship. Not authorized? Are we not worth rescuing? Am I getting that right? Lower echelon status means less support. You knew that was a part of the probation deal. Yeah, but I would think that goes out the window when we start dealing with giant man-eating worms, Chase! Danger detail, Astrid. You requested it. Your job is to get the freighter. If I didn't think you could do it, I wouldn't have sent you. The freighter... ma'am, you are not gonna get a freighter if my crew is dead! Not to mention the civilian survivors! Why don't you tell me the Space Force's response is to that? Bring everybody back. That's the job. Chase! Chase! God... Okay. Come on. They're not coming. Then we're on our own. Let's get off this planet. Major, pilot Young has reported that they are under attack by worms. The worms were supposed to be dormant now. And? And I'd like to request a retrieval team. Denied. Sir, I'm aware that retrieval squads are not usually called in for probation crews. But under the circumstances... They're no different. We'll recover the freighter when the worms are dormant. The crew's expendable. Dismissed. - Sir... - Dismissed, Captain! Astrid? Ronnie? Rebecca? Anybody? Come in! Over. MOLV One, come in! Can anybody hear me? Okay, buddy. We can't stay here much longer. We gotta move. How long was I out for? Not long, maybe an hour. Wish it had been longer. I was dreaming about my Hawaiian honeymoon with my girl, Marilyn. We were planning it for a while. For the pain. The air feels thicker. Oxygen levels are down. CO2 is up. We need to try to get to the freighter on our own. It's closer than the tug. I can't do anything with this bum leg. Here. Tie this around your waist. I can drop you down and support you from up here. What about the worm? I haven't seen it in a while. Besides, we can't stay here. The air is getting toxic. Oh, by the way, it's gonna hurt a little bit on the way down. So do your best to keep as quiet as you can. Okay. Slow? - Uh-huh. - Go. Brad, there's a worm! Pull me up! Brad, there's a worm. Brad! Pull me up! Brad! I got it! I got it! Got it! Maybe we can try again in a little bit. No, we can't. The worm knows we're here. It's just gonna wait us out. We're gonna die here. There's got to be another way. We need to find another way outta here. The volcano's getting ready to blow! We have to get out of here! Those gases are toxic! Sulfur... I... I can't breath! We have to get outta here, Brad! Come on. What are you doing? If you fire that thing, it's gonna cave in! I know. That's exactly what I wanna do! I'm gonna create an air vent. Cover your head. Look out! Well, there's that. Change of plans. We're going out through the ceiling. I can't climb. Well, you're gonna have to. All right. Hop on! Hold tight! We're going up! I got an idea! Hey! Over here! It's coming! It's coming! Come on! What? No! I'll stay right here, thank you very much! Harley, the only way we're gonna get back to the freighter is if the worm takes us! I can control it with the hook! See, I'm in control! Now skootch on down here and get onboard! We don't have all day! Hold on to me! Rebecca! Worm! Ah! No! No! Ah! I'm so sorry. She was gonna get us out of here. She was the only one who knew how to fix the rig. It'll be okay. How is it gonna be okay? We're stuck here. Astrid's gonna come back and we're gonna figure out how to get to the tug. This is not over. Yeah, I don't see any movement around the tug. Think we'll make it. How far is it? Not far. We'll have to make a run for it, but we gotta get out of the sun anyway. I know. Another day out here in this sun and no water... Here. Lean on me, all right? I'll guide you down. Watch where you put your foot! You okay? This would have been my last mission. Yep. Harley and I were supposed to get married when this one was done. He was ready to go home, take up a teaching position. But I needed this one last run. He only came to be with me. So... it's my fault that we're here! You couldn't have known this was gonna happen. You weren't told. None of us was. Still... Still, if it weren't for me, we would be on a beach somewhere sipping Mai Tais! You got plenty of beach out there. I guess this place is kind of beautiful in its desolation. I think you been in the sun too long. I guess it is their world, after all. World full of worms. Wonderful. Technically, I would put them in the Hirudinea family. You know, leeches. Blood-sucking worms with teeth. Fantastic. Giant worms that eat blood. You think your ship was the one that woke 'em up? Possibly, but I suspect another cause. Yeah, we gotta pick up the pace. We can't stay on this rock. Is there anything else you can tell me about these worms' detection method? I mean, sound? Movement? Can they see us? Based on my observations, they can sense ferrous compounds, oxides and such. They seem to be attracted to them. Yeah, they like rust. Simplistic, but yes, as well as human hemoglobin. They also have some sort of sensory system in their skin that allows them to detect soundwaves and ground vibrations. They can track us. Yeah. We gotta get off this rock. And we have to be aggressive about it. Do we have weapons? Not exactly. Maybe we can come up with something. What you got in your backpack? Most of my equipment isn't gonna be all that useful. It's for collecting samples. Well, anything could help. What you got? Plastic petri dishes, sample vials, Ph strips, funnels, test tubes, cork, this glass bottle. - The sample vials? - Yeah. And this... Got anything flammable in there? This bio stain... and this fixative. Why? I'm gonna make a bomb... or 10. So, that gets us a total of 10. I hope it's enough. If you wanna hurt them, aim for their mouths. Their hides are too tough. Honestly, I don't wanna get close enough to hit their mouths. Just gonna be a distraction. Gotcha. You ready? No, but let's do this anyway. We're gonna make it! I think you're just making it angry. Just buying us time! Go! - Oh, it's the mother! - Run! She's too big! She'll tear this ship open like a tuna can! I know. I'll get us airborne. We'll get the others, we'll get off this planet! Mayday! Mayday! To all rescue crew of MOLV One! Over! We're on our way! Mayday! Mayday! Lieutenant Young to Base. We need immediate rescue! Captain Chase, come in! We need immediate rescue now! Hold on. We're losing fuel. Can we make it to the freighter? No. We're losing it too quick. I gotta set her back down. I got a plan, though. What is all that stuff? It's an abandon-ship survival kit just in case my plan doesn't work. Plan? What plan? You'll see. This was your plan? The ship will explode! That is the plan. Jump! What was that? Our ride home. We're stranded. Your crew? And my team? Marilyn? Not Astrid. She's tougher than that. Come on, Astrid, don't be dead. The air's getting thinner. The fire, the explosion, it's eating up all the oxygen. Here. What about you? I'm okay. Just take it! - No, I can't take your last bit. - Just take it, Marilyn! Let me feel like I'm doing my job! Space Force rescue unit 4A, you are not clear for departure. Cut engines and return to base. That's a noncompliance, base. One of our own is stranded, and I'm going in as backup. Over. Captain Chase, this is Major Hawkins. You are in direct violation of Protocol Number 127... Wow, that is so weird being on the other side of that conversation. It didn't even work! What have I done? Oh, my God, I shouldn't even be here! I shouldn't even be here! God, why can't I just follow orders? Just do what people expect of me? That's not what good people do. Oh, yeah? You think good people leave their crew for dead just to go off and play super hero? No. No, Rebecca was right! I'm a reckless pilot! Now they're all paying the price! Look, Harley and I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you! And if I'm not mistaken, there's an entire crew out there that is waiting for someone to get them off of this planet. Maybe even someone a little reckless. Okay, you're right. We're gonna suffocate and you're worried about a couple of boo-boos? Oh, my God! I know it hurts, you big baby. Not that. Look! It's... It's Marilyn! Marilyn! Where's the team? I'm sorry, Harley. I'm glad they're back, but that tug was our ride out of here. We've got nothing. Even if we fight off the worms, we're gonna run out of air. Whoa! It's a Space Force Rescue Ship! Hey! We're over here! MOLV One team! This is Captain Chase with Space Force! Prepare for extraction and rescue! Looks like someone broke the rules! Hey, where's Rebecca? Okay, come on! Everybody hold on! Buckle up! We gotta move. Look out! We lost one of our thrusters. I can't get any higher. We need something to take this thing out permanently! We've got missiles! Use them! I did. This is a rescue ship, not a fighter. We're empty. But we're not entirely out of options. Brad, open that red case on the floor. I was hoping for a bazooka. I didn't have time to steal one. It's a timed fusion grenade. It'll blow a hole in the side of that worm. So how do I deploy it? It's a time delay. Set the timer and throw it. Get us in the air! I'll deploy it! If I get us up in the air, we are just leaving. I like that plan better. Everybody please hold on. Go, go, go, go! Working on it! We're still too low! Brad, give me that! Bon appetit! It's pulling us down! 5-0 seconds and counting! Very much aware, Lieutenant. Ah! Chase! We need maximum thrust! Astrid, no! The ship's about to break apart! The bomb is gonna detonate! Do it! Pushing thrusters to 100%! It's not enough! Astrid, it's clamping down and breaking the ship apart! That's all we've got! No, we can get more. The thrusters are maxed out! Yeah, but I'm gonna super-charge it! Get the controls! We're headed straight for a volcano! Pull up! Astrid, Chase is still out. She's not breathing. Come on, Captain, Stay with me. Come on, Captain! We been fighting the worms all day! You can handle a bump on the head! Come on, Chase. You broke the rules to save us. Now I just need you to wake up so I can say I told you so! At least let me to say I'm sorry! I never gave up on you. I know. Oh, what... Hang onto something. It's gonna get rough. The volcano is about to erupt! Altitude 100,000 feet! - Maximum thrusters? - Max thrusters. Hold on. We're clear. Space Force, this is pilot Astrid Young. We are clear of Planet Dune, looking for homeward escort to Earth. Pilot Young, this is Space Force command. You are cleared for escort. Ship manifest, we have lost one member of our crew, five members of the freighter, the tug ship and the freighter. Pilot Young, this is Major Hawkins. We're glad to hear there are survivors from the freighter. Your probation is complete. Thank you, sir. Congratulations, Lieutenant. I'm pleased to inform you you're being reinstated to Rescue Team. We're happy to have you back. Yeah, I'm happy to be back, sir. I thought... Because of the cosmonaut, I thought I was in trouble. Quite the opposite. Vasily Petrakov isn't just any Russian. He's a national hero who designed new solar panels that improve power grids 200%. They weren't going to share that tech with us, but thanks to you diplomatic relations with Russia are ongoing. Lieutenant? Yeah, Major, sir. You did the right thing. We're a better division for it. Thank you, sir. I'm gonna need a crew when we get home. You in? It'd be an honor. Brad? You know it. I don't wanna be working tug ships forever. Captain Chase? I'll put in a request. I think it'll be approved. All right. Now let's get home and save some lives. Can we at least take a shower first?
