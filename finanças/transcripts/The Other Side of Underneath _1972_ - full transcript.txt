Now... we're going to saw the old woman in half! Ha ha ha! Now, I'm going to begin a story. And the little boy in the bed... Will be my helper. Ha ha ha ha ha! Hal ha! Hah! Ha ha ha ha ha! It's a cast of my head. - Tell me about your head. - Hm? Tell me about your head. I don't know very much about my head. Why did you do that? - You tell me. - Because you hate us. You think I hate you? Why do you despise me? You think I'm petty and greedy. I think you're petty and greedy? Mm-hm. Do you think that, or do I think that? I think I've got petty, petty, petty, petty things. What are you thinking about now? I'm thinking that you're looking at me with incredibly critical eyes. Yes? - Can you look in the mirror? - I don't want to. - Why not? - 'Cos I don't like that face. - You don't like your face or my face? - No, my face. - Which one don't you like? - I don't like mine. Why aren't you crying? You're always crying when I see you other times. I'm not crying always. Well, what's wrong with your face? Why are you trying to make a fool of me? - Am I trying to make a fool of you? - Mm. - How do you know that? - I just feel it. Why do you feel that... That I'm trying to make a fool of you? Why do you feel that? I can just feel laughter, you know, inside you most of the time. Inside me most of the time is laughter? About me, yes. All the things you're gearing me towards are about being hostile towards you. When did I start that? You think I felt hostile? - Do you think you're ill? - I think most people are ill. - No, do you think you are ill? - Probably. Hm? What do you think your illness is? - Greed. - What was that? - Greed. - Greed. Why are you so hungry? J dum dum dum j dum dum dum j dum dum dum I feel a sense of loss all the time. You feel a sense of what? Loss. All the time. All the time. Mm-hm. People are stealing things from you? No, I'm losing them. And what's your definition of 'calamitously ill"? I haven't lost complete and total contact with my physical self or the physical world. I would feel that was infinitely more calamitous. Have you ever experienced orgasm? - Very rare. - But you have. Mm, once or twice. Can you tell me about those occasions? They weren't actually... Maybe they weren't really orgasms because they weren't very phenomenal... at all. And how do you decide what is really orgasm? Well, it must be a moment of ecstasy. I don't think I've ever really experienced a moment of ecstasy, no. Do you think there's an analogy between colonised people and women? It's like trying to scatter all their brains. Like that. So why are you on my list? Because you are in control of the situation and I'm not. I haven't really said very much. Oh, I know. You don't have to say much. Why is that? Oh, oh, how can I say why is that? Oh, I know that a lot of my relationship with you is about treatment. But I keep probably fooling myself that some of it isn't. And what's the bit that you keep fooling yourself about? That I actually have something to give you. Go to bed now. Why do you want to give these things to somebody who thinks you're a petty, stupid, ridiculous, foolish, little person? Because even though you sort of think those things, I still love you, so... That's probably stupidity or masochism. I don't know. What are you supposed...? What are you supposed to be doing? You're up against the wall. It's such a huge wall. So heavy. Let go of the wall. Oh... Ohh! Let go of the wall. There needn't have been a wall at all. - What? - There needn't have been a wall at all. They bound me very fast. Who bound you fast? Who bound you? I don't know. They knew how to bind well, anyway. They knew what? How to bind very well. They've had a lot of practice. Mm. Very. Urh! Ohh! Yes. Why? Why what? Why do they want to bind me? Why do they want to bind you? Why do they want to bind you? Why do they want to bind you? To strike me. To take away my breath. I can't breathe.

And he used to point to it, he did. He pointed at it and he said, if you goes on like that, I'll bloody use it on your bottom! I bloody will!" He said. All the things he told you was to protect you. You know that, don't you? It's to fucking protect you. Here. Protect it his way, that's what it is. Protect it his way. It's not about anybody else. You're all right! You've got to grow old, haven't you? Ahh! Argh! I'll say you need this! I've remembered it's a kind of word. Like a pivot in the middle of everything. Why are you crying? You're very beautiful. Ljes. What's the truth? What's the truth? I've got these funny noises. Why can't you see? Why can't you see? I want to see something underneath. - I want to see something underneath. - Or what? Underneath or what? What do you want to see? There is everything under there. Under each of us is all the pain and all the love. All of it in all of us. All this pain and it's so simple. It's so simple. Just empty it out... There's no change. They were in fucking pain and it's gone. Just... Oh, why are we so afraid of caring? - Why don't you believe it? - It's lies! What's the truth? What's the truth? What's the truth? I am you! - When you choose. - Choose? There's no choice. We are! - There's no choice. - Oh, yes, there is. You've got to say there's that margin of freedom. Of course there is. Of course there is. I know that. I know that. Look, you're saying now, 'yes, I know.' But that's not what you feel. It's not how I act. My feelings. My... Yes, I make my responses in the wrong direction. I get caught always in this archetypal oppression. Caught, caught, caught. But there are always some time, somewhere the spaces I can see through. Do you go through or do you see through? Do you go through or do you see through? I don't go through for very long, but at least - at least they have... happened... a moment. A day... And you know that you can dive into the dungeon. Lost. Lost. - It's lost. And... we've got 5,000 years of whips on our back. Lost. It was my own fault. I have colluded. I have colluded and decided not to be... Part of this. That's why I was in the nursing tent. And what you get... What you receive there, you receive hostility. Because they will take... Those people only have the time to accept you as the role you choose. The role you choose. I feel a tremendous collusion. Collusion between us? Against you? Fears of exclusion, of rejection. I'd do anything now, but it doesn't matter any more. I'm trying to keep up some kind of facade. I'm trying to keep up some mad image to please somewhere or other. Me too. Where you place the most need. Just because I'm very frightened. Now I can no longer be frightened. It doesn't matter. I cannot receive from where... where? From where? Well, I've been looking. You receive it from each and every... every person. Don't place it in one. - Orifyoudo it... - It hurts. It hurts. That's exclusion and collusion. And get it in one. One is everything. Yes. Yes. And the one contains everything. Everything. Everything. Everything. Why has it paralysed you? 'Cos there's... 'Cos there's no free flow. Free flow. I can only look at it. Look at it. It doesn't flow. Your face or my face - which one don't you like? I don't like mine. You don't like your face? 'Cos I've never seen it so beautifully flow when it does, whichever direction it takes. What are you thinking? - Sentimentality. - Sentimentality. She's pretty. She's got a pointless mind. - She's pretty. - She's got a pointless mind. - She's pretty. - She's got a pointless mind. You can't ask people to explain how they feel and then constantly put it down. This is what I've searched out all my fucking life and I find it here as well. You think that I was putting you down? The most. Desire? Our father, king of worms, multiplier of numbers, we have made a cross-section of the facts, and come up with murder. Mur-der! Mur-der! Strength, little girl... is madness. And madness is the persistent belief in one's own hatefulness. Lightning in the brain signals down the arm, persuading the fingers to conclude that which happened a very long time ago. When... this... light... goes... out... We'll measure it... against the sky. And the difference... will ascertain... The night... of the witch howl. The night... of the burning.

The aim of the game... Is to find out why... I know what it is! Oh, I know what it is. Oh, I know what it is. It's not wanting to leave. It's the thing about mother and father not wanting to leave. Ahh! Ahh! Oh, what are we doing to ourselves? Ahh! Ahh! Ohh! Ohh! Oh! It's blood! I can feel it! Hush to the sounds of the beasts! She presented with what we thought in the beginning was schizophrenic symptoms. She was grimacing, crying, tearing a handkerchief she had in her hands to bits. This was the first time we saw her. 'I can't stand it, I can't tolerate it. Everything is all wrong. I have to do away with myself. This kind of thing. I have the throw abouts often. What do you mean by the throw about? Oh, I throw furniture often and I beat my husband. So we saw her alone for the first time. She was referred by a psychiatrist at the day centre. So we thought, "hmm, my god," you know. "It's a hell of a problem here. We'll have to see the whole family because we can't fit this into context. So she was put on some sedative medication, just to keep her nice and quiet, containing her until the next time we could see the husband and the children. - What's a schizophrenic? - What is a schizophrenic? Oh, my god, there are so many different definitions, you see, depending upon the psychiatrist who's making it. So it's entirely through his eyes? It is, exactly. If you had sergeant, who is the chief, he uses medicine. He used to use lobotomies, they're out now. They are really out of date and nobody does that any more. He uses medicine. Then you get other people who would use a philosophical approach to it. You see? We've got half a dozen psychiatrists in two hospitals. And the three in each use different approaches. And how you come out will depend on which doctor you've been under. Isn't it? This I will cling to, all the time. What can you see in the water? What can you see? Hmm? It's like everything kind of dropping into... Ts centre well. A little. What's in the well? Ring the police! Ring the police! Get her away from me. Pull her away. Hey! Come on! No! Leave her where she is. We're having the police. We're having the police. The police? 'Can't help that, ' said the cat. "We're all mad here. I'm mad. You are mad.' - I want you to take a card. - 'How do you know I'm mad?' Said Alice. "You must be, ' said the cat. 'Or you wouldn't have come here.' Then give it back to me. Alice didn't think that proved it at all. However, she went on... 'How do you know that you are mad?' We've had some illness in the family. For a long time [I think. 'A dog's not mad. You Grant that.' 'l suppose so, ' said Alice. But you are keeping very well. "You see, a dog growls when it's angry and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now, I growl when I'm pleased. And wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore. I'm mad.' That's a good lifeline you've got there. Hasn't changed over the years. I'm mad. You're mad. I'm mad... you're mad. - I'm mad. - Mad. - I'm mad. - Mad... Come, little girl. Come. Oh, thank you. Do you want some more? Would you like to put some grapefruit juice in this? Yeah. That's it, tear a bit off. Scrunch it up. Steady now. There's a good girl. That's right. That's right, that's right. The more the merrier. Where's the other cock got to? > Please release me oh, release me and let me love again I have found a new love, dear and I will always want her near her lips are warm while yours are cold so, release me and let me love again Quiet. > And I touched you... with soft words I whispered your name I had your love on the tips of my fingers but that's as close as I came your eyes were a vision of sweetness your lips were at my command wahoo! > I had your love on the tips of my fingers and I let it slip right through my hands somebody took you when I wasn't looking I should have known from the start it's a long, long way from the tips of your fingers to the love hidden deep in your heart to the love hidden deep in your heart > Ave Maria I'm only here for the beer. What can you see? What's in the well? > Goodnight Irene Now, fight fair. Out the way. Let them fight fair. And perhaps when you show me the film I'll be able to see myself as I am without these. Yes.

Irene! > Good night, Irene I'll see you in my dreams the stars reveal your dreams are real I'll see you in my dreams Argh! > Goodnight, Irene I'll see you in my dreams the stars reveal your dreams are real I'll see you in my dreams It's a cast of my head. Tell me about your head. Tell me about your head. I don't know very much about my head. Why did you do that? You tell me. Because you hate us.
