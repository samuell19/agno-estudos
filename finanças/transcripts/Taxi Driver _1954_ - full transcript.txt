If he's at home, I'll pay you right away. - Who is this Ratan Lal? - Music director. A maternal uncle? Paternal uncle? Father-in-law? - Then? - Not related. "Not related" is dicey. This is the building. Come on. Looks like this is the house. Anybody home? What are you up to? That isn't going to wake him up. He's sound asleep. Not enough to wake him up. - You want something? - You have visitors. - Mr. Ratan Lal? - Who's Ratan Lal? - Doesn't he live here? - What's the address? - Gul Naaz Building #4. - Number four? Your turn, is it? This is number four. - What are you up to? - Breaking the shoe in. - Your have visitors. - Whom are you visiting? - Are you Mr. Ratan Lal? - I'm Moti Lal. - What Ratan Lal are you looking for? - Ratan Lal, music director. - He moved out long ago. - Where to? He could be anywhere in Bombay. But he's surely in Bombay. In Bombay? She walks out on her parents. She runs away to Bombay, for Ratan Lal? - Something like that. - And she fell among thieves? - Go back home. - My parents are dead. My uncle was trying to palm me off for the money. - And how do you know Ratan Lal? - He came to our village last year. - He aprreciated my voice. - Only voice? He said, come to Bombay. I'll give you a job. You'll make a name. - What's your name? - Mala. Nice name. I'm Mangal. Friends call me Hero. - We've been to three or four places. Now what? - What am I to do? Keys. To my pad. You sleep there. I'll sleep in the cab. - I can't do that. - Stop arguing and move it. - Your house? - Just a room on rent. I imagined you're rich, and you have a house, servants... - What made you think that? - To own a motor car, you must be rich. - This is just a taxi. - A taxi is also a motor car. A motor car is a rich man's slave. A taxi is the poor cabbie's provider. Come on in. That's where you sleep. If you're hungry, try potluck. Bolt the door. Hello Sylvie. You're late today. The Hero's heart-throb. For you, I could write poetry. - You're very late, Sylvie. - I went to The Taj. I might land a job there. Don't let Sylvie go to The Taj. Just let me win at the races. I'll make this place better than The Taj. That's nonsense. You haven't paid me in a month. I'll double your wages once I win at the races. For Sylvie, I'll give anything, D'Mello speaking. Yes, how many times must I say? That's my horse. - Mr. D'Mello, you gave the tip away. - This time I'm winning. - That's what you always say. - Howdy, Mr. D'Mello. - Hi Hero. Where have you been? - Get out of my nose. - You stink. - Who says I'm drunk? Look, the bottle is so empty that it sounds. Get lost. This bottle is an heirloom. The magic of it being, just put your finger in it, and then lick it. So the forefathers licked it dry. For me, the smell of it is kick enough. Saved it. How come he always comes to the club drunk? Who Mastana? No. I wouldn't let him in if he's drunk. He just looks drunk. - That's why he's called Mastana. - How could that be? Even the cops picked him up once. They learned he doesn't drink. It's just a put-on. Heady lifestyle, is it? Live it up. Unite your heart with another heart and fall in love Make some pleasant commitment Why should we be ashamed? Why should we be scared? Why should we die before living our life? Under the shade of the drape and the colorful atmosphere... make your life more beautiful Springs come and Springs go I've been waiting with open arms for so long I'm feeling intoxicated.

Sorry, I forgot about your share. Here's twenty. - Keep it. - I clipped a hundred off him. Your share is 20. Buy someone a drink. You refuse? I'll give it to the taxi. - A drink for the taxi? - Why not? - Hey, I want the taxi tonight. - What for? - What for? What do you think this is? - Cash. What else? And it's biting me. I won't rest till I've got rid of it - Then let it stay in my pocket. - I have pockets, too. But this money is ill-gotten. Left to you, you're likely... - to lose sleep over it, and I too. - Then get lost. - Hey listen, I want the taxi. - All right, I'll do you this favor. - How about dropping you home? - I'd rather walk the empty streets. I guess you deserve a lick at least. Sweet. Let's go Tony. Hey smart ass, get out. - Who is it? - Get up. It's your father. - Where's daddy? - Up here. Get up. - I thought the car was upside down. Sorry, it was me. Let me sleep a while longer. Don't make me do it to you. - What voice do I hear? - Such a sweet voice. - Must be a confectioner's daughter. - And bitten by a honey bee? But it's coming from your pad. - The door is locked from the outside. - Don't you see? - Could it be a ghost? - Just the radio. - Radio? - Yes. Never mind, then. How about standing me breakfast? What happened to your eighty? The money that was biting you. Women are treacherous. She sings one song for me, and she takes all my eighty. That's what puts you off to sleep? Take this, and get out of my face for a couple of days. - What was that? Singing practice? - I was reciting the Ramayana. - He told me, read it every morning. - Who did? Ratan Lal? - Yes. - And where is he? - I'm still looking. Let's go. Why do you put me in the back seat like a servant? Not like a servant. Like the boss. It's so different out here. - You're a wag. - What's a wag? You don't know? What do you know? A wag is a wag. Does one Mr. Ratan Lal live here? What now? Today you sleep in the room. I'll sleep in the cab. Out here the goons will get you. Go on, don't worry about me. If my horse wins I'll spruce up this hotel, like The Taj Mahal Hotel. Sylvie, my love. My diamond. - Where's the Hero? - That's what I want to know too. - Want to know about me, my love? - Think of the devil and here he is. - She's been pining away for you - Hero, he's writing poetry about Sylvie. - How about a reading? - How could I write? Sylvie has no comparison. - You won't ever change, will you? - He sold his wife's jewelry. - You don't deserve any mercy. - He cheats at cards. No, he doesn't. I do. But he always wins. - Get out of here. - I've got to get back home. Were it not for the soft spot I have for you... - One more, please. - Don't come back. Soft spot. Try this. - He's the one. - He is. - I've wanted him for so long. - Mastana, what do the dogs need? - Bones. Right. Where's the girl? Live and let live. These are the days of youthfulness Where will you find such atmosphere again? These are the days to live Everyone has to die. Try and enjoy life Try and enjoy a few moments of love The air and this weather tell us to make merry Choose some flower. Have some dream Change the destiny of your heart Everyone has to die. Try and enjoy life Try and enjoy a few moments of love This melodious life is a beautiful song Don't bring grief into your life my dear Because this is the world of happiness Everyone has to die. Try and enjoy life Try and enjoy a few moments of love Unwinded me. - I'll size you up another day, son. - Suit yourself. What girl are you hiding? It was the radio, was it? I want to know too. - Why do you want to know? - Who's the girl? If you talk too much, I'll teach you a lesson. Watch it, watch it. Let go. Take that. And go home. Hero, come let me take that weight off your chest. - What's this? - The world goes around in circles. - The world goes around in smoodles. - Yes. But where's the money? So that's why the world is in such a mess. Every day, this taxi... goes out and here it comes back Got it. Even the city goes around in circles. - Who have I in this wide world? - No one at all - This taxi? But no, not even this taxi, once it runs out of gas. I'm sick and tired to this thing. I wish I could set it on fire. - Give it to me. I'll set fire to it. - You can have it. May I? Thanks. It hurts very badly. What's wrong with you? What happened? Your eyes are bloodshot. You're feverish. Don't pin me down. Leave me. What's it with you? Come, sit down. - You aren't scared of me? - Of you? - What if I carry you away? - Where would you take me? I'm here. Home with you. - You trust me so much? - Even more. - Why? - God is kind. You're kind too. No. I'm not like that. I'm scum. Look into my eyes. They're red. - And nothing else? - Nothing else. - Now tell me. - What? I'm drunk. Drunk. So you see who you're trusting? I'm a drunk. A goon. A hooligan. A taxi driver. - But why did you drink? - Because I wanted to. What are you doing? Someone who can be screamed at in the middle of the road. Drive. - Sorry, I'm not going. - Why won't you? - Then your daddy will drive me. - I won't. I just drive a taxi. But who cares? The one who pays me my fare, owns me. But tell me, what isn't for hire? And that woman spits it out. Taxi driver. I said I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm not a drunkard. I never drink. I have a permit, but I save my money. I told you, I won't drink again. Here's my permit. Do what you want. That gets me a smile. Come, I'll take you for a drive. - Tough times, man. - Real tough. Train coming in, Hero. I hope I get a long distance passenger. - Do you see what I see? - What? Your sister-in-law. - Goodness. - Why are you scared? - Take her home for me. - But... - No questions. - Sister-in-law, she's coming. - Whose? Mine. If she sees you, we're dead. - Then? - Think of something. I hope she doesn't just barge in. - What are you doing? - Making a man of you. From now on, you're my cleaner. What are you up to? You cut my hair. If my sister-in-law walks in now, you'll lose the rest of it. Put this on. I'll wait outside. Hack the hair. And put it on. Make sure you look like a boy. Hurry up. - Are you ready? - Yes. Your name isn't Mala anymore. Your name is... - Rajput. Why are you crying? - My hair. - He loved it. - Who? Ratan Lal? What's your name? Not Mala, Rajput. Let me see how you walk. Not like that. Walk like a man. Nice. - Good. Do you know how to curse? - No. Then you can't pass for a boy. Go on. Use foul language. I hacked your hair. Call me names. Go on. You're a sinner. Oh-so-loving. Use something good and foul, like damn, swine, asshole. Good God. - Every fifth word you speak is "damn". - But that's swearing. Everything is expressed in terms of damnation. Proof that one is man enough. Like this damn bed, this damn room, that damn window, damned Rajput. - Damn you, Hero. - Bravo. Take a drag. Hello, sister-in-law. When did you come? Nice to have you here. I missed you. But why are you walking? - Am I dead? - Never say that. - Why didn't you take a cab for her? - Rajput, this is my sister-in-law. - God bless you, son. My new cleaner. Smart kid. - New cleaner? What about me? - Enjoy your retirement. Polish the car. Then, buy some groceries. Sister-in-law will cook. - Do you know how to clean a car? - Damn you. - How nice. I'm here for only a couple of days to finalise this matter. - Finalise what? - Your marriage. - Forget it, sister-in-law. - No way. Pack. You're coming with me. - Sit down. I'll get your luggage. The matter is a bit delicate, pertaining to my marriage, etc. Get the group over over here, and brief them. - Is that so? - Hurry. - Should I take the car? - Go on. You don't even know how to clean a car. - Here, learn how to do it. - Keep the spit for later. Now sit in the car, and see how she drives. - Where did you get this Ramayan? - I've become religious. - Who taught you that? - In the end it always works out. So, it's about Hero's wedding? - He's going to regret it. - Cowards. Are you scared of women? You don't yet know what a woman is. - Grow up first. Here, take a drag. - You're just a boy. You smoke? I'm a man. New recruit. Hey, cleaner. Do you hear me? Clean it the way I showed you. That's the way. Now it shines. Come in. I heard your sister-in-law is in town... so I said to myself, why not meet her? Plain water? You should've asked for a lemonade. It's time he got married. He's becoming a vagabond. - Shut up. - He's right. Find a good girl for him. Not like mine. Mine was a love marriage. The wife turned out to be tramp. I trashed her. She walked out. There's a very good girl. My younger sister. Get him married as soon as the lawsuit is resolved. Lawsuit? Mastana. You gave it away. - Tell me, what's this about? - Nothing much. - I just beat up someone. - Why did you have to fight? - Tell me, what happened? - One day, I took three passengers... two men, and a woman. And they say drive, so I drove. Now listen to this carefully. I'm driving fast. I'm covering miles, and I tell myself nice catch. I'll make a nice tip. Then I ask, where do you want to go? No sooner do I ask, one of them puts a knife to my neck... and says, keep driving or I'll stick you. That winded me. It was a dark stormy night. And then it started raining. And there was thunder, lightning. Suddenly I hear the woman screaming. Help. They got off near a deserted hut, and they began molesting her. I hit one of them. He fell down. The other one stabbed me. Here. By the time I pulled the dagger out, they had escaped. The girl was sobbing. She was in bad shape. I brought her back. I put her up in a hotel, and the next day... I go there looking for her, and who do I see? Her uncle. Not one question asked, and he slaps me on my face. Now that made me very angry. I beat him back and blue. The police arrived. And I'm framed. - What's going to happen? - Three months, maybe six. - Jail? - At least that long. Let's just get done with the wedding. Let the lawsuit be settled first. And get out of this taxi business. - It's so dangerous. - Never mind that. Drink the water. Rajput, the luggage. - Put it on the berth above. - Someone is sleeping on it. - Give my regards to my brother. - I'll work on the wedding. That wasn't the right thing to do to your sister-in-law. That was a pack of lies. Why did you have to lie? That makes me a liar, a scoundrel, and a rogue, right? I am what I am. But I won't like to hear it from you. Crying already? What are you? Boy or girl? You left after the fight, and I couldn't sleep all night. - What's your angle? - When are you coming? Try someone else. Just a casual acquaintance. She dances at the club. She talks like that to everyone. No questions? Go on, ask. To hell with you. - She's just a tramp. - Don't say that. Wag. Sylvie of the golden voice. You are my... No. I'm the one who's mad about you. - How about a song? - Sure. One song. No. Only when Hero comes. So Hero means more to you than all of us? What about all the verses I've written about you? - He must've found someone else. - Possibly. - Jealous? Beauty is worth the jealousy. - What's wrong with him? - What are you lost in? I've thought it over. And I've decided to get married. - And there's a girl waiting for you? - Who is it? The girl in the house across the street. - But she's lame in one leg. - So what? Imagine marrying a girl who has both her legs... and worrying that she might run away. Worse, if she breaks a leg you end up taking her to the hospital. Then you end up spending a lot of money on medicine and care. You're asking for trouble. This one has broken a leg already. A perfect specimen. - Say what? And what do you say? - Makes sense. But her mother is evil. - Whom are you marrying? The daughter, or the mother? - The mother. Why are you laughing? - You want to marry her mother? - Did I say "mother"? That one needs to be fixed. - How about a hand of rummy? - You wanna get slapped? - I'm not playing. - My money is right inside my pocket. Look. - Go and sit over there. - I'm just watching the show - Don't you gamble. - Never. - How do I look? - Why did you have to accost me in public? - Shouldn't I have? - No. I see you and I don't talk to you? Not necessary. Not in public. Sylvie, Mummy calling. - So, how are you? - Fine. One tea. Special. For Hero. Sylvie will be singing here. She won't go to The Taj. And I'm fixing this place up. Make sure you come every day. You see, the point is Sylvie is sticking around for your sake. And I'm running this club for Sylvie's sake. Understood. Perfectly. - Are you upset? - No, cheerful. Sylvie, listen. You and I aren't made for each other. - He won again. - You won't stop until... you've sold everything you have. Go to hell. Hero, there's a lot of cash on the table. Come on, win it. No thank you. My taxi still provides for me. I have something to tell you. - Where's he going? - Stop him. He's going away for real. Ask him, why? A girl. - Try sniffing this. - Get lost. - Where are you going now? - To hell. I hear that's one nice place. Hurry up. Pile in. I'm off to sleep. Take the taxi if you want to go somewhere. At this hour? Let's party in your room. - What party? - We're all set up. - Not in my room. - Of course. In your room. Come back. You don't go in there. Get out. Hey Rajput. Mala? Hero, I don't want to stand between you and Sylvie. Anyway, I'm just a burden on you. Good bye. The Ramayan is what I treasure. Just keep it. Mala. Flat tire. Are you engaged? Mr Ratan Lal, please come. Put the luggage in the cab. Fix the flat and get home. Ratan Lal? Mr. Ratan Lal, the recording has gone off well. - The song is a hit. - Maybe. - But I couldn't get the tenor I wanted. - Yes, your singer, the girl Moti... - she couldn't deliver it. - She couldn't possibly. This is how it should've been sung. There you are, my love. I've been waiting for you. Where have you been all these days? Hey, where are you going? Mr. D'Mello is missing you. And that Sylvie, she's crying for you. And I've stopped sniffing my bottle. Why, what's the matter? You look lost. - Come on. Let's go to the club. - All right. D'Mello says that if Hero doesn't turn up, Sylvie will quit her job. Poor D'Mello, what'll happen to him then? Hurry up Anton. Make sure you come in early tomorrow morning. - Hello, my Hero. It's been so long. - Closed? How about some tea? Anything and everything you want. This club is yours. - Great. But where's the tea? - Why do you want tea? - Listen, I'm taking the car. - All right. You know Hero, Sylvie has been morose for sometime now. She even said she'd leave. Get my point? Sit, I'll get tea for you. - One more notice. - What is it? It's from the R.T.O. regarding taxes. They'll confiscate my permit... - if I don't pay it in two days - Why don't you pay up? - Will your daddy give me money? - Did he tell you to roam around? - Rajput also ran away. - What are you saying? - You must not have paid him, right? - What are you saying? Set to wander, right? What's the matter Hero? You look sad. Can I help you? - Remember Rajput, the cleaner? - Has he cleaned you out? - Yes, something is missing. - What? Actually, he's a she. So that was your radio. I suspected all along. - Forget her. You still have Sylvie. - You won't understand, Mastana. Passenger, stop. Let's take a passenger. Very well. Darling, we wanted another nanny, didn't we? She's here for the job. 30 per month, food and shelter. Agreed? If I find fault with you, you're out. All my material possessions, gone. This fiver is the last one left. Let's burn it. Beginning tomorrow, no taxi either. In that case, let's do it to the fiver right away. - But we can still taxi around? - Sure. D'Mello's car. - D'Mello's car has had it today. - This is one day he'll remember. - To hell with our sorrows. - Hell with our sorrows? No. Sorrow. - Sorrow is a disease. - What a line. A disease for people to live with. Dramatic. If you want peace... keep nothing. Let's shake hands over it.

Now a little chant, and the rope is one piece. - You're a wonderful magician. - No way. - You've worked a more magical spell on me. - Leave me. - Well, magician? - She was trying her magic on me. - Was she? - Yes. - Now watch my magic. - No. The next time you try magic, I'll make you a cripple. And you. Here's your ten rupees. And out you go. Bash him up. - Let's fight to the end. - Take off your shirt. He's scared. He ran. Rajput, are you? We know you're a girl. - Hero.

I told you to mend your ways. - What do I do now, Hero? - I have nothing on me. Check my pockets. Empty. Take it from me. How about a hand? What say? - What say? The taxi is no more. - Just sit down, partner. - Careful. He's sharp. - But he's the Hero. Stop! - Hero, he deals dirty. - What did you say? - You cheat. - All right, you deal. Give him a whipping, man. - One more? - Lose at the tables, win in love. And losers in love, win at the tables. - Get it? - Leave love for later. First, this hand. Play Hero. Try your luck. My love, or this money? Let's see what wins. - Deal? - Deal. Ask for show, Hero. What love? Just pick up the money. - That was Hero playing. - Hero, look I've caught your cleaner. Gambling. Hero, the money. You saw me drinking. Now you've seen me gambling. But why did you leave? Why did you leave me? I'm a wag. I did three jobs. I made twenty rupees. I went looking for you, and I found Ratan Lal. Really? - Take me to him. - I will. - Engaged! - Move it! You think your father owns the taxi? Move it, son. No one move. I suspect someone. I gave him a beating once. Find out who he is, where he lives. Let me know what you find out. Have you told the police? You're finished, both of you. - Change clothes. I'll be back. - What's the matter? - No questions. Go. - Can I borrow your taxi? - Sure. - What news of the heist? - No news yet. It's been a long time since I saw you dressed as a woman. Lovely. What a thing to say. Time we parted, Mala. I'll drop you at Ratan Lal's place. I read the Ramayan every morning. I'll imagine hearing your voice. I'm not going. You must. With me, you'll be in danger, too. I won't go. I won't. What a wag. No crying, now. - I don't wish to leave you. - Don't be mad, Mala. Go on, try your luck. You have the looks. You have the voice. With Ratan Lal's help, someday you'll sing. The whole country will hear you sing What a name you'll make. And fame. And money - Then one day, I'll walk up to you and I'll ask, Taxi, Madam? - No. Don't lose this chance. - Go on. - No. - You must. There's Ratan Lal. isn't he the one? Come on. Greetings, sir. Maybe he doesn't recognize you. Go on, talk to him. - Want me to call him? - No. I'm not going. Mala. Listen to me. - What are you doing? - I'm not going. I won't let you lose this opportunity. I've never asked you for anything. I'm sure he'll recognize your voice. Sing Mala, sing for my sake. No. I won't sing. You will. Where oh where can I go? Who in this world understands the stress of a broken heart? Oh, the departing one, who has left me behind... I find it very hard to live without you. I can't forget you With flames in my chest and sighs in my breaths How can I cope with this life? My emotions have been drained Where oh where can I go? Who in this world understands the stress of a broken heart? Fantastic! I'm coming. - Greetings. - Mala, you? I didn't even recognize you, but I heard your voice... and knew it must be Mala. When did you come? What's the matter, Mala? Has he made off with your luggage? That's what all these taxi drivers are like. Come, you must meet my wife. So you're the one. You're always causing trouble here. No hooliganism here. - Where are you off to, Sylvie? - Who are you? Forgotten me already? I was about to clobber the taxi driver... when you knocked me out cold. What happened? I never saw that. Look, there sits the wounded army of admirers. - If you want, you may enlist too. - I'll be back. Enlisting? Welcome. Come here everyday. Die for her, everyday. I'll be back soon, son. - What's your hurry? - Don't you cross my path. If I ever see you here again, I'll break your face. - Won it. - What? - My horse. At number five. - What's the prize money? - Lots and lots. Now I'll build a hotel even better than The Taj Mahal. And Sylvie stays on. - I shot him. - Ass. Who was that in there? - Boss, we have to talk. - You're late. - The taxi driver escaped. - Never mind. I suggest you pay him to keep his mouth shut. - Right. - Boss, if the police find out... - we'll have to leave Bombay. - No way. Keep an eye on the taxi driver. Go to Ratan Lal's house tomorrow. Tell seth Bhagwandas he can have the money he needs for his film. On interest. Go on. Be careful. The other day, there was this girl who came here in my taxi. She left her luggage behind. Will you please call her? - I'll give it to her. - Will you please call her? She can't come. I'll give it to her. Yes, the taxi driver. Turns out to be a nice fellow. - He hasn't left, has he? - He wanted to see you. I told him he can't. - Why? That's him, the robber. She's the girl we took to the beach. - I've seen her somewhere else too. - Is there a mystery? - Welcome. What brings you here? - We have to talk. - Well, what is it? - A message from my boss to your producer. He isn't here. I can convey it to him. The message is only for him. - When is he expected? - In half an hour. - Then we'll wait. - Sure, be seated. Where oh where can I go? Who in this world understands the distress of a broken heart? Where oh where can I go? Life is a series of disappointments What else remains in this life? With sadness in my soul and smoke in my heart... where oh where can I go? My heart is full of sadness, sorrowful for both you and me There is little hope for this heart to survive How can one boat survive a hundred storms? Where oh where can I go? Who in this world understands the distress of a broken heart? Excuse me. Come over here, will you? All right, don't. I'll walk over to you. Listen to me. We aren't enemies, are we? Forget what's past. We're friends now. Son, we'd be happy if you kept mum about that matter with the police. Who do you think you're talking to? You're talking to Daddy. - You've trained her to perfection. - She's very accomplished. - The audiences would die to hear her in the movies. - Right. Lovely voice, isn't it, Boss? Why only sing? You could even become a heroine. - Well, Mr. Producer? - I was thinking the same. But what does the director think? Whatever you and the boss think. Done. The audiences will remember every song she sings. Like a rumba or a samba. I know an Anglo-Indian girl who sings at a club. She's fabulous. - Make sure you hear her. I'll take you there. - Sure. Wake up, Mala. No one moves. Go on. Well, son? Who owns this place? These hooligans have ruined my club. That one's the leader of the pack. There's one more tied up inside. - I'm a film director. - Film director? Come along. The one who was sitting here is the one who shot at us. - I think he escaped. - Move it. Drink this coffee You'll be alright. He only has one bullet left. Stay here. I'll give you. Now I have you. Tony, turn on the lights. Give this to Mr. D'Mello. Tell him to hand it over to the police. - Anton, where's Sylvie? - I don't know. She must've left. Tell her I'll come back to thank her. She saved my life.
