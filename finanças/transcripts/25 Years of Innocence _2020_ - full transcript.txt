BASED ON TRUE EVENTS APRIL 17, 2000 Step aside! Police. Sit. - Name? - Komenda. - Repeat! - Komenda. - Trousers? - In the wardrobe. Get dressed. Where's your sweatshirt? - There. - Tomek! Let's go. - Tomek! - What's going on? Leave him alone! Hands behind your back! What are you doing to him? Get up. Tomek! Get your shoes on, quick! Let's go. 25 YEARS OF INNOCENCE The other side. Turn to face me. A little to the left. Look into the camera. Strip down! Hurry the fuck up! Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. OK. Arms up. Lift your dick and balls. Spread your cheeks and cough. I confess to the charge. I was at home... we were having a New Year's Eve party. - I gone out... - I went out. I went out. I took a bus to Miłoszyce. I met a girl at the party, her name was Kaśka. We were dancing, drinking alcohol. Then we went to the woods and had sex. I didn't force her at all. After that... she went home, and I came back to Wrocław. Is this your cap? Do you understand the charge? Sex with an underaged girl. “I misunderstood the charge. I do not confess to the crime.” Bars! Stand here. In! I wanna wake up. JANUARY 1, 1997 THREE YEARS BEFORE THE ARREST - Hey. - Yo! Know what time it is, son? - Come help us! - OK, mom. Get out of there! Here's our party animal. You missed the best fun, man. Mom! Come on, not today! - Just for two hours. - Look at this mess. Scout's honor. Last time you also said “two hours.” Please. Just two hours, I promise. - Hi, Tomek! - Morning. Come on, I promise... Thanks! Be good, Krystian. Thank you. Bye! The village of Miłoszyce is shocked by a brutal rape and murder of a teenage girl who spent New Year's Eve at a local disco. A special police team from Wrocław is being assigned to the case. Do you know who did it? The perpetrators left clues. It's a matter of time till we catch them. Tomek, be careful! There are little kids here. - You wanna eat off paper, dumb-ass? - You're a dumb-ass. Boys! Watch your language! Gerard! It's too cold, the car won't start. Wait, don't touch that. - She came here again? - She did. Maybe we should adopt him, huh? Mirek, give me a break. I'll borrow jumper cables. Use this. - I got distracted. - What were you thinking about? Nothing. I have no plans for the New Year. You can make plans, but life goes its own way. Switch the channel. Let's take a walk down memory lane to the delights of childhood... Good morning, Wrocław! It's 6:30, a frosty October morning. Sixty-three days left to the end of the year or in fact to the end of the century! Let's start the day with Manu Chao's “Bongo Bong.” AVAILABLE TAKEN Tomek! - An Audi's next. - OK. OCTOBER 16, 1999 SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ARREST Tomek! Stop that. Get inside! Why are you prying? She's enough trouble already. She tried to leave Krystian with you? She did. - What did you bring here? - Mom packed it. Can you stay? I have some yeast cake left. - No, grandma, I need to go. - Sure. You're always roaming around town. I don't know why. Here, take this. You look like an angel. Keep pouring! Darn, it's running over! Guys, meet Bogusław. Come on in! - Hi. - Hi, “young guard”. Małgonia, you were talking about a worm... It's a “millennium worm” or something-- A bug, not a worm. My boss told us to copy everything to floppy disks. What for? Computers will go crazy on New Year's Eve. How come? Computers may see two zeros as the year 2000 or 1900, and everything will stop working. The police as well? Let's drink to that! - To the bug disaster! - A beautiful one! Mommy, I wet myself. Excuse me. Pour me one. Will you stay with me? What'd I say, Krystian? Mama has guests. Go back to bed, now! But you will come to me? Later, sleep. Come on, you want me to eat out of your hand? So there's another man in your life. Let's drink to our dear police! Do you remember that case from Miłoszyce? - Remember? - What case? A girl was raped on New Year's Eve. Yeah, I remember. You've been sitting on it three years. It's not that simple. Over 300 people at that disco. All of them were questioned. - We have face sketches, expert opinions. - Yeah? The guy who lives next door dated her. But no one questioned him. - Is that so? - Well, yes. He borrowed money from me for tickets. You don't say... Holy shit... So, another round? Yeah. - Going out like this? - Yes. You're kidding. I ironed your shirt. - You'll look like a human being. - Mom! - It's too elegant. - No, it's not. You need to dress nicely. Give it to me. You can't go on a date dressed like a slob. Button up. No pulling faces. See how nice you look? Nice. Mom? I don't know what to say to her. So I'll go with you? I'm joking! Be yourself. Everything will be fine. You have a good heart. You like your job, huh? Yeah... Is it difficult? It depends. On what? You need to know the ropes. And that means what exactly? First the roof, hood, then the sides and fenders. You need the right cleaner, microfiber towels to absorb water. - Then you need to wax. - Why not an automatic car wash? No way! It scratches the paint. Ask your dad. There are different kinds of upholstery, for example leather, ozone generators, steam cleaners, special brushes to remove dog hair... or cat hair. You'd like your own car wash? Sure. You'll have one. I have to go. You look... like an angel. Thanks. Will I see you again? Maybe. Tomasz Komenda? - Yes. - Police. You're coming with us. - Why? - We need to talk. Do you need help getting in? How old are you? - Twenty-three. - Are you studying? No, I only finished primary school. Where do you work? - In a car wash. - Oh, cool. Yeah, it's cool. - Like your job? - I do. - You have a car? - Nope, no car. And no driver's license. A criminal record? Nope. Tell me... Where's Miłoszyce? I don't know. Where were you for the last few New Year's? At home. We are always home. The best place, huh? Yeah. Press here. Rinse your mouth. May I go now? Won't you ask why you're here? You know what? You know very well why you're here. Are you playing dumb? Talk, you fuck! Mom says it's better to say nothing than to say something dumb. Always listen to your mom. You may go. - What's going on? - Everyone was questioned. APRIL 2000 TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ARREST Me, Gerard, Krzysiek, Teresa, the neighbors... Not everyone, I wasn't! They took our blood samples and teeth impressions. - Did it hurt? - Piotrek! Tomek was told to squeeze some cotton pads. What for? Maybe for the scent. Did they ask you about Miłoszyce? Where is that? A hick village outside Wrocław. - Any of you been there? - No. Goddammit. What happened there? A murder. Three years ago on New Year's Eve. We were at home. Stop it! This must be a mistake. It will all clear up. Get this off the table. Tomek, where are you? What are you doing? Nothing. What do you mean? Just thinking. About what? Nothing. Don't lie to me. Close the window, it's cold. An odorological exam was performed on March 9, 2000 in the Police Headquarters in Wrocław by a team from the Forensic Medicine Laboratory - led by Dr. Jerzy Kawulski. - Put it in here. TOMASZ KOMENDA Odor traces were identified by specially trained dogs, Aza and Heks. Odor traces from the cap found at the crime scene match the sample taken from Tomasz Komenda. The deceased had bruises and scratches on the skin of her face, breasts, arms, and legs. The injuries prove that she was brutally subdued. The bite marks on her breast were made by Komenda or a different person with similar dental alignment and deformities. Severe injuries of her vagina and anus were caused by the forceful insertion of blunt objects. Forensic experts confirm that the DNA from a hair found in the cap matches Tomasz Komenda's DNA. He's a good kid. He's never caused any trouble at school or at home. JANUARY 2001 NINE MONTHS AFTER THE ARREST It was the New Year's Eve. Alcohol changes people. I've already told you he was with us. He went to bed first. He can't hold his liquor. He said he went to Miłoszyce that night. He can't have left unnoticed. Twelve people were there. You've been to our place. We're packed in like sardines. Calm down, there's hard evidence against your son. He will be tried in court. Law, justice-- What are you talking about? What law? What justice? If you have money, you hire a lawyer. - Your son has one. - A public defender. You saw him. He doesn't give a shit. Well, I can't help you here. You could let me visit him. I wish I could. There are procedures. I last saw him nine months ago. Nine months. Hi, mom. Hi, son. How's dad? And the boys? They all say hello. And the little one? He asked, so we told him you got drafted into the Army. I'm sorry... What for? Tomek, look at me. Look at me! Tomek! Tomek! You did nothing wrong! Nothing wrong. You can't forget that. Mom, take me home. I can't stand it. I know. I'll get you out, I promise. It will all clear up. You hang in there? All right. Sign this. Hurry up. NOVEMBER 14, 2003 3 YEARS AFTER THE ARREST Marysia was 15 years old. She was just a happy child with her whole life ahead of her. The defendant took that life away from her. He raped her savagely and beat her. He left her there. She was alone, semi-conscious. It was nearly minus 20 degrees. Marysia lay dying... for several hours, in the dark. She was alone. Your Honor, I demand that the defendant should be found guilty and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. Only 12 years, it won't hold. They don't have enough. Your Honor, this is indeed a shocking case, one that generates a lot of emotion, should not be judged based on emotions. In the name of the Republic of Poland the Regional Court in Wrocław decides to change the charge from “rape” and “battery causing death” to “murder,” finds the defendant guilty, and sentences him to 15 years' imprisonment. What? This is a joke! Order in the court! Twelve people can confirm that he was at home with us!! Order in the court! Murderer! Degenerate! Out! Put it down. Face to the wall. Get in. Good morning. Howdy. - Where are your docs? - In the deposit box. - What? - In the deposit box. Oh, really? - Which section? - It's 148. - How many years? - Fifteen. Whoa! A crystal wedding! Who did you kill? A neighbor. A fish. Respect. Think I don't know you are a fucking piece of shit? Here are the docs. Did you bring lube? Did you? “Nope?” Your ass'll be sore. Fucking punk! Sing or your mug will end in the crapper. Sing “I lied”... Let him be, for now. He's trash, killed a kid. Don't turn him out now. Louder, bitch! I don't want guards hovering around here. He will be our servant. Get out of there, bitch! What's in there? Fuck, it ain't much. Take these. Shoes. Take off the shoes! - You've got 15 minutes. - Fuck off. Get in there, pretty boy. Watch and learn. Gently, bitch. Oh yeah... Count time! How are you doing? Things are good? What are you eying? My old lady? Or the Grand Canyon? Where will you get the money to go to America? None of your business. I report all four inmates present. Have a good day. Thanks, guys. - Enjoy. - Enjoy. You fuck! I didn't know you were so famous. Here, you mean less than losers, rats, and roaches, you scumbag childfucker. Pound the fucker! All right, how do you feel? Do you know who did this to you? You don't know. Was it someone from our block? I don't know. You don't know. How will you report it? I don't know. All right. That's all, then. Please... Transfer me from here... What? Can you transfer me? Careful or you'll transfer to a coffin. You fucking piece of shit. Four zlotys change. Thanks. Goodbye. Mother of a monster. Who said that? Who? - Yes? - Butter please. Who's that? Not important. JUNE 16, 2004 4 YEARS AFTER THE ARREST The defense counsel is absent. The Court of Appeals in Wrocław, after hearing the appeals filed by the defense and by the prosecution against the trial court's judgment dated November 14, 2003, amends the judgment by increasing the penalty imposed by the trial court and sentencing the defendant to 25 years' imprisonment. All sit. All sit. All sit! Tomek... Tomek. Tomek! Tomek! Tomek! How could you do this to me? How could you? You ever try that again, I will too. There'll be two coffins, not one! I'm sorry! I don't give a shit about your apologies! You hear me? Swear to me you'll never do this again! - I swear. - Louder! I swear! Why are you staring? Marek, yard one! Adaś, speak up! - What the fuck you doing? - Same shit as you! - Thanks. - For what? For cutting me down. If you'd hanged yourself, we'd all be screwed. I want to do my time in peace. You! Come here. C'mon. You'll get used to it. Don't count the days, or you'll lose your fucking mind. Don't dwell on the past. Make no plans, focus on today. Everything's in here. The real prison's in your head. AUGUST 2015 WELCOME TO MIŁOSZYCE Put the table there. - Isia! - Yes? Is this how you're helping mom? Come here. - You won't catch me! - I will! I remember when your parents bought a plot and started to build a house here. You wanted to be a priest. Why did you quit? A priest must be able to forgive. I really suck at it. Look, Remik, we have a problem here. What problem? Some bastard is raping women. He has for years. - Who's in charge of this? - District police. They don't have shit. What do people say? What could they say? He must be from here. Somewhere around here. Miłoszyce, Jelcz, Piekary. How do you know it's the same guy? Because... He does things to girls. What things? Remember my niece? Kołecki's daughter. Yeah, Justyna. She was assaulted a year ago. Talk to her. Make sure she's alone, her parents wanna forget. Dad, we'll be late. Easy, we can make it. - Hi, dad. - Hi. Hi, Justynka. Good morning, Mr. Korejwo. - Where are you rushing? - To the station. Hop in, I'll give you a lift. Did you see his face? He came up behind me. A short, stocky guy. How do you know? I felt him gasping into my neck. He stank badly. What happened next? Did he use a condom? He shoved his fist inside me. He bit my breasts and arms, tore my hair. Did he say anything? After, he said I was lucky the winter's warm. MIŁOSZYCE CRIME FIFTEEN YEARS FOR BRUTAL MURDER IN MIŁOSZYCE How about we buy floral tiles for the kitchen? IT WAS MINUS 17 DEGREES. MARYSIA FROZE TO DEATH A PARTICULARLY BRUTAL CRIME Remik? Dinner's in ten. Get ready. - All right. - Isia, help me with the dishes. WILL TOMASZ K. REVEAL WHO HELPED HIM? Excuse me, ma'am. Yes. My name's Korejwo. I know who you are. You've recently moved here. That's right. Could I talk to you for a moment? Here you are. At least two men were involved. Only one of them is in prison. The other is out there. Are you going to catch him? They killed our girl almost 20 years ago. A hundred people were around. So you want to find him now? Who? Where? For fuck's sake... Maybe you'd like to see Marysia's room? You may come in. We went to look for her in the morning. We even came a few steps away from that yard... We didn't see her from the street. She kept asking us to go to that party. We never let her before. Never. - Remember to be back by one. - Of course. Wait, take this off... Dad, seriously? Yes. Stand there. Stand there, I'll take a photo. May I go? - C'mon. - Coming. Good morning. Yes. Korejwo. I'm with the police. What do you want? To talk to your husband. Do you have a warrant? No, but... I could help you. You were the prime suspect. You even confessed. They'd come to his school, take him for questioning They beat him so hard he had brain swelling. Anyone would've confessed. Who beat you? Don't be afraid. Tołoczko and Pilas. You said Marysia left with some boy... Irek. He was with another man. You saw his face? Was he tall or short? Short. Like Irek. Are you sure? You said in court Komenda was Irek. But I later took this back. When Komenda got up, I saw that he was tall. Irek was short and stocky. - Good morning. - Good morning. Here you are. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION What the fuck...? Excuse me! Could I borrow a ruler? I don't believe it. Hello. Yeah, my phone was on silent. What? OK, I'm on my way. Who wants to open the door? Me! Olek. Isia, your turn's tomorrow. Chop-chop! You were 40 minutes late. I'm sorry. What's going on? What should I do? About what? Nothing checks out. A young girl was brutally killed, and an innocent boy went to prison. What? He's served 15 years. - So you know what to do. - Yeah. I'd have to turn against my own. They'll give me hell, throw me out. How are we going to make ends meet? - You'll farm pigs. - What? You've got quite skilled at dealing with them. - From my hand? - No. - Wawrzyniak, Marecki, get out. - Fuck, now? Hurry the fuck up. Just in time to save your ass. What are you scribbling? For the TV and papers. Come, sit here. Sit. Eat. Or it will get cold. Eat! Say “hi” to the world outside. I'll send you a card. From the Grand Canyon. - Or the Niagara Falls. - Will you take your wife with you? Yes. Remember what I told you? Remember? That's right. You need to tell the parole board what they want to hear, and you'll get out early. Confess to something I didn't do? To get 10 or 12 years less? Ain't that worth the lie? Don't let them change you completely. Count time! Oh, fuck me... What? - Oldie cut himself! - What? Did the fucking Dutch! Guard! Guard! Guard! The full 25 years. He did his whole time. All the bullshit about America. What a nutjob. Stop philosophizing. He had no one to go back to. - And his wife? - He killed her with a hammer. And her boyfriend, too. In bed. Sleep tight. You get it? Six years in one cell, thought I knew Oldie. You never know anyone. Hey, Miłoszyce guy. No, I didn't do it. I know you didn't. I wouldn't be talking to you. I served time with this guy. He knew who killed her. And some loser got time for that. Did he tell you who did it? A nutjob from round there. Cops covered it up. End of yard time! What was his name? Mirek, Irek or something. - The guy who told you that-- - Gonzo. Excuse me, I've brought these documents... But your son's case is closed. I've waited here... But this case is closed. Your ex-wife claims she has the right... Why didn't you file it? - You can't... - Why didn't you file the application? - What application? - To the court in Strasbourg. I promised to file it, but now... You missed the deadline, you bastard... It was our last chance. My boy... Hi. What's up? Listen, there's a guy here who could testify I'm innocent. - What? - He knows people who know the truth. - Yeah? - I wrote that he should be questioned. It's good. It's good you wrote. Mom? What? Mom, what's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? - But I can see. - No, it's nothing. I'm tired. - Mom... - I can't help you. - What do you mean? - I can't. But you're helping me, you're here. I sometimes think it's all my fault. No. Your dad threw me down the stairs when I was pregnant with you. He's not my father. Mirek is. If I'd dumped him sooner, maybe none of this... Look at me. You're the best mom in the world. If you give up, there'll be two coffins. You get it? Two coffins, not one. My boy... I'm sorry. Howdy, Piki! When are you getting out? Howdy, Herman! In two weeks. Talk to you later. You snitched on me, motherfucker! - I have a family. - You said... I didn't say shit. I never said shit to you, bitch! It's me, mom! Komenda, visitation. - Today? - Hurry up. - Good morning. - I'm Grzegorz Głuszak. Sit down. I got your letter. What letter? You wrote to TV, saying you wanted to talk. You still want to? Aren't you afraid? AUGUST 2006 6 YEARS AFTER THE ARREST - You want to show your face? - Yes, I'm innocent. Other inmates will know who you are. You don't believe me? Well, you were convicted. Can we start? You were sentenced to 25 years for killing Maria M. You can only get out early by naming who helped you. But I can't. - Why? - I didn't hurt that girl. - Who did? - The police are covering for him. Your DNA was found at the crime scene. Not mine, I wasn't there. Come on, you said you were there. You met a girl... named Kaśka. They made me say it. - Who did? - A police officer. He beat me so hard I'd have said that I shot the Pope. - Is that punk doing time here? - I don't know him. Fucking hell! Hey, 107 to 219! Ear to the window! Speak! - Watchin' the tube? - Yeah! - See that punk? - A motherfucking smartass! - Which cell is he in? - No clue! Hey, 107, he's in your block! Which cell? 119, I think. That piece of shit was laying low. Give him here! We'll fuck some sense into him! Fuck that bitch! Fuck that bitch! Who the fuck are you? Wardzek, get moving. Stop it! Order! Move aside. Take your stuff. Fast! - Get out, punk! - Fucking rat! Yard time's over! Move it! Stand there. Don't stand there, kick the bowl. Now the water. Time to jump. You think you're a star, you childfucker? Come on, get jumping! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Hi. - Hi. - My name's Irek. I'm Marysia. Happy New Year. Here you are. Thanks. Happy New Year. Keep breathing. Feeling any better? Better now? Breathe in and out. Hey, what did you do to her? - Nothing, she felt sick. - It's not nothing. - I helped-- - Shut the fuck up. Who the fuck are you? Irek, her brother. I'm taking her home. Get back inside. Krzysiek! Come inside! Come on! Then this Irek guy took her. Must have been drugged, to go with him. Komenda was in Wrocław, watching fireworks. No buses were running, so how did he get to Miłoszyce? JULY 2016 Didn't the prosecutors or the court check that? No. Twelve people said he got drunk and went to bed. - And the disco? - There were 300 people there. None of them saw him. So how did they conclude he did it? Yeah... You could call it a miracle. The woman who informed on him worked in a police sports club. - She didn't testify in court. - Why? She was a key witness. She had a prior conviction for perjury. They didn't know, huh? They did. After three years they were so pressed by the media and minister that they wanted to lock someone up and close the case. Remik... We went over this so many times. Are you sure? Does this story hold water? - Remik? - Excuse me. Hey, boss... If you want to reopen this case, I'm in. You're joking, right? We'd need a smart, fair-minded prosecutor. Know anyone like that? - Morning. - How can I help you? Korejwo. I've been transferred. Oh, it's you. The boss is waiting. - You wanted to see me. - Come in. We're having a party. The chief's retiring. Sit. - Coffee? Tea? - Thanks. I'm not thirsty. How do you like it here? It's fine. But... I'd need a room. A room? I can do that. Have you started renovating your house? Money's a little tight, huh? Look, I'm setting up a team to reinvestigate the Miłoszyce case. Let's join forces. We can sort this out together. You scratch my back... This is now a case for the National Prosecutor's Office. Listen, Remik... Talk to your prosecutor friends. You go fishing together. OK, I'll talk to them. Fuck, do you think I don't know why they sent you here? - Fuck! - Calm down. Wait, not here. Go, just walk! They set this case up, now they'll reinvestigate? Do you know what bonuses they got for Komenda? They'll shut us down. - Easy, we won't let them. - How? We'll get you demoted. What? You won't report the criminal division anymore... But to us instead. And? What do you say? All right. If we don't find anything on this Irek, we're fucked. You can work on my pig farm. Everything will be OK. God's on our side. To hell with the bastards! There were two or three perpetrators. But they got Komenda and stopped looking. On purpose? Yes. One guy from a nearby village fits the description. He was at that party. - Was he questioned? - Four days later. They took a DNA sample. - No match. - Why are we talking about him? They used an old polymarker. Not good for paternity tests. It was pure coincidence that it matched Komenda's DNA. Or maybe it wasn't. The guy first surfaced in 2008. A brutal rape. He got away with... a suspended sentence. You get it? He raped again, served four years. And he did it again and again. Every time with extreme cruelty. Probably more times, unreported. I think he continued when Komenda was in prison. Now the best part. His name. Irek? Ireneusz? All right, let's move forward on this. There were 300 people. Half of them girls. Irek only talks about one. Listen to his explanation. “She was pretty, she danced nicely.” - He fixated on her. - Fine, give it to me. - Something's wrong. - Something? Nothing makes sense. Witnesses were not questioned, evidence appeared and disappeared. Here, take a look. In 1997 the cap was listed as an ordinary exhibit. No need to secure odor traces. They gave it to dogs as an odor trace after three fucking years. Dogs are never wrong. They gave them something with Komenda's scent Here is Irek's testimony. “She was dressed in black, head to toe. The dress, tights, shoes. Only her socks were white.” And what? I'll tell you what! White socks! He can't have seen them. They were under her leggings. He had to undress her to see them. I can't take it any longer. You can. I don't know what's happening. One day drags on, and then... I smoke a cigarette, and it's one month later. What about yard time? It's getting warm. I'm too afraid to walk out. And the hearing? What about the date? In three weeks. What's the point, anyway? I ran into the owner of that car wash. On Płocka Street. Know what he said? He'll offer you a job once you're out. You were the best. No one was better than you. And no one is. You really ran into the car wash owner? Four previous parole requests were denied. Do you know why? Because you can't take responsibility for the crime you committed. I didn't do it. I shouldn't be here. That is correct. You shouldn't be here. Go back to your cell. When you understand you can't cover for others, write to us again. When you meet a girl, when do you start thinking about those things? Fuck me... How many got past the third date? None. Do something, for fuck's sake. We reopened the Miłoszyce case after 21 years, because we believe it was not investigated properly. ...42-year-old Ireneusz W. was arrested. Is he the other perpetrator? We have evidence allowing us to press charges against him. This afternoon Ireneusz W. was brought before prosecutors in Wrocław He was charged with raping and murdering Maria M. Call me Remik. Come. JUNE 24, 2017 17 YEARS AFTER THE ARREST In 500 meters turn right. A talking phone, huh? Yeah. On the day of your arrest, on April 17, 2000, you were brought before Prosecutor Kostrzyna. Do you know what time it was? No, not exactly. It was late in the evening. Who else was present there? There was... the recording clerk and Officer Tołoczko. Why did you say you were in Miłoszyce on New Year's Eve in 1997? Because... It's OK, we have time. So you like fucking little girls? No, that's not true. Sit up straight! Straight, you fuck! So I'm lying, huh? No, sir. - You like fucking little girls. - Let me go home. You were in Miłoszyce. I was never there! I wasn't there... I will shoot your stupid head off, you motherfucker. You won't see your mommy or your brothers. You want that, you fuck? I'll tell you everything. Whatever you want. Now you're talking. Why didn't you say so in court? My lawyer told me not to. He said this was the line of defense. Why do you think Officers Tołoczko and Pilas told you to confess to having sex with a non-existent woman named Kasia? Why not to raping Maria Malczewska? I don't know. Maybe that confession was enough for them. Thank you, that's all. For today, I mean. Thank you. Gentlemen... I waited 17 years for you. Do you believe I'm innocent? No, we know you are. Why do I have to go back there? We need more time. We'll prove you are innocent. Biological tests leave no doubt that the cap from the crime scene belonged to Ireneusz Waluszczak, and not to Tomasz Komenda. Experts from the Forensic Medicine Laboratory stated conclusively that the bite marks on the victim's body were not made by Tomasz Komenda. Errors in dental measurements are up to... 3.5 millimeters. Are you saying that three courts, including this one, experts, and police officers were all in the wrong? Were the dogs in cahoots as well? Your Honor, we would argue that the prosecutors provided material that they knew would give the desired test results. In light of these facts, we ask this court to acquit Tomasz Komenda. The first time prosecutors and police are fighting together for an acquittal. Tomasz Komenda may be released from prison today.
