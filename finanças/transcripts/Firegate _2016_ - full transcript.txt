LEGEND OF THREE MEN SENT TO CLOSE THE FIREGATE A GIANT APPEARS IN... A MYSTERIOUS CREATURE SEEN ON... FIREGATE FACULTY OF CULTURAL SCIENCES These are the three things that man pursues... from ancient times to the present day. Wealth... power... and knowledge. Nothing else matters. One would consider... seeking wealth to be less noble than seeking knowledge. Or that even fighting for glory is deemed more honorable, when, in fact, they are actually one and the same. If man could resist pursuing each of these three things, the world would be a better place. Sir, might I ask you a few questions? -Go right ahead. -May I ask your name? -Choki, sir. -Okay, then, Mr. Choki. -Do you believe in the supernatural? -Definitely. Go away! What demon scares you the most? The giant goblin and the banshee. Fellow citizens... this city park has been cleansed of evil. It is now a safe place. Hey, look. It's Mr. Guntur Samudra. He's that guy from that hit reality TV show. -That's him? -Yes. Mr. Guntur Samudra. I'm Tomo from Occult magazine. Yes, I've heard of you. And you're here because... I'm scouting locations for my TV show. Well, we've actually just finished with the cleansing ritual here. Nothing else needs doing. There's no point in you being here. Excellent! Leave some spirits for me next time, all right? All right, I have to go. See you all in TV land tonight. Give me more. You can make easy money from your shaman practice, right? I gave you this gig! OCCULT MAGAZINE THE MYSTERY OF THE RUWATAN RITUAL It's been several years now that our country's researchers have studied the Mount Padang Site. Now is the time to put all our resources into this excavation. The pyramid of Mount Padang will be a symbol of Indonesian culture on the international stage. That's why, for the time being, we've decided to close this site... to all foreign parties. That was a pretty shocking statement from our president at this morning's press conference. His statement has generated a massive uproar from leaders all over the world. The excavation of the Mount Padang historical site is still a controversial issue. There are pros and cons to the Indonesian government's high budget for this excavation. With us in the studio is Dr. Arni Kumalasari, a representative from the archeology team appointed by the president himself. -Good day, Doctor. -Good day. I'm sorry to hear that the head of the archeology team, Professor Theo, couldn't be with us today. So, first off, can you explain to us why this site is so important? The total area of this site is 25 hectares. That's ten times larger than Borobudur. The pyramid found at Mount Padang is arguably the oldest known pyramid in the world today. This could change the whole history of mankind. And what is your take on the many foreign officials questioning the ability of Indonesia's archeology team to excavate this massive historical site? Look, we don't aim to please everyone. Our excavation teams are only responsible to our government and the people of Indonesia. Protests from other nations... are not really our concern. We could blow this up into a major story. If you can come up with a big angle for the story, I could find some sponsors and turn this into a special edition of our magazine. All right. It's a deal. My usual 50-50 fee, right? Done. Yes. Happy birthday, sweetie. -Thank you, Daddy. -You're welcome, sweetie. What's this? -I wonder what this is? -Daddy, what is it? With this, you can reach me wherever I am. Here, let me show you. Good girl. It's time for me to go. Here. DISTRICT COURT OF SOUTH JAKARTA TO: MRS. VERONIKA LETTER OF CUSTODY It's final. You're only allowed to visit Lila once a year. This is unacceptable. You can't forbid me from seeing my own daughter. If you don't agree, file an appeal with the court. What's wrong with you? Why do you hate me so much? I'm doing this for her own good. -You're a bad influence on our daughter. -"Bad influence"? Yes. Look at you. You work at a tabloid that prints manipulative news and cons people into believing rubbish. Don't you think that's a bad influence on Lila? I work to provide for my family. Isn't that what you asked of me all these years? You do want me to provide for Lila, right? The best thing for Lila right now is to have a father she can be proud of, Tomo. Unlike you. Idealism won't put food on the table. I don't get you. You used to be a man of principles. What changed you? Principles? Vero... You left when I was struggling to make ends meet, so don't you dare talk to me about principles! You think I left because you were broke? Don't raise your voice. Lila is sleeping next door. I'm going to file an appeal. I, Guntur Samudra, son of the soul of the universe, will exorcise all of the evil spirits straight to the hereafter. We meet again. Tonight, I'm going to take you to a different reality. Where the hidden comes to light. Tonight on... THE MYSTICAL WORLD! A CONFLICT IN INDONESIA'S JUSTICE ENFORCEMENT CORRUPTION IN PUBLIC PROJECTS EXPOSED BEST INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM ARTICLE TOMO GUNADI FACULTY OF CULTURAL SCIENCE Pyramid consists of two words. "Pyra" derives from the Greek, meaning "fire." And "mid' meaning "center." There are still many things we have yet to learn about the pyramids. First of all, why do landmarks all across the world take the shape of a pyramid? AGE DIFFERENCES PYRAMID OF EL CASTILLO PYRAMID OF GIZA - PYRAMID OF MOUNT PADANG Considering their geographical distance and the diversity in arts and religion, how could these distinct cultures build similar structures with no lines of communication? The Mount Padang pyramid... is the oldest pyramid known to the world today. CARBON DATING BY BATAN LAB (INDONESIA) AND BETA MIAMI LAB (U.S) Carbon-dating analysis of Mount Padang suggests an origin of 4,800 BC, while the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt dates back to 2,850 BC. This discovery will rewrite world history as we know it, because in 4,800 BC there was supposedly no civilization this advanced in Indonesia. Then why has there been no record about this civilization before? Do you recall the theory of punctuated uniformitarianism? Indonesia lies on the Ring of Fire... ...and is an active tectonic plate. We may never know how many natural disasters have happened in Indonesia since prehistoric times. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis. There is a considerable possibility that all evidence of ancient Indonesian civilization has been buried... and is just waiting to be discovered. Dr. Arni? Can I have a minute? Yes. Is there something I can help you with? I'm a reporter, and I'd like to ask about the findings on Mount Padang. Who do you write for? OCCULT MAGAZINE Sorry, but we haven't discovered any mummies or ancient curses at Mount Padang. What have you discovered so far? Pardon me. Not that I don't respect your profession, but in my opinion... your tabloid is one of the reasons our country is stuck in the past. If our people are bound by superstitions, how can we think critically? So you want a serious question? Explain your team's justification for spending a billion rupiahs on an archeological dig that does nothing to benefit those below the poverty line. This site has proven that Indonesia is the center of global civilization. This will change how the world sees Indonesia. Maybe this is what our people need to free us from the inferiority complex dragging down Indonesian culture for generations. People don't need a false hope. What we need is social welfare. One might question why the pyramids in China and Ukraine haven't been explored yet. There's simply no hurry. A nation's pride isn't measured in wealth alone. It's easy to be an idealist... if you have money. Vero? Lila. Who are you? Where is my daughter? Don't let the fire spread. WELCOME TO GUNANG PADANG SITE Why is it so crowded, Syam? Tom. When rumors of hidden treasure spread, people got curious. Why? They're worried we'd disturb the site and interfere with the archeologists' work. Look who's here. The master himself. I, Guntur Samudra, son of the soul of the universe... will exorcise all of the evil spirits straight to the hereafter! Hey! Where are all the poltergeists? I'm getting bored! It's taking too long. -Peace be upon you. -Upon you, too. Ma'am, do you happen to know the village caretaker of Mount Padang? The caretaker's name is Mr. Iwan. Where does he live? His home's nearby. Turn left at the corner and then go straight until you see a giant tree. He lives there. -Thank you, ma'am. -You're most welcome. Excuse me. -Good day, sir. -Who are you? My name is Tomo. I'm a journalist from Jakarta. There are a few questions I'd like to ask you, sir. I'm done talking to the press. There's nothing left to say. But, sir, it's about Mount Padang. Why don't you go and ask those fancy researchers down there? We've been denied access, sir. They don't understand what they've unleashed. I'm certain this inscription... is the key to finding... the entrance to the pyramid. Gate. Fire. Beginning. And light. What about this symbol, Professor? Ba-dur-akh. Badurakh. I'm still not sure what that means. Go get some rest. I'll see you in the morning, Professor. WEST SIDE - ENTRANCE Professor, is it possible the iron content in the pyroxene andesite is... Professor! Wulan, get over here! Yes! Professor? Professor? Oh, my God. I understand, sir, if that comes straight from the president himself. What happened, Syam? They said the professor died of a heart attack. Why did they send an old man to do fieldwork? Dr. Arni, what is the cause of the professor's death? -Good morning. -Good morning. As you might have heard... early this morning, Professor Theo Wirawan died of a heart attack. We will continue the excavation in honor of the professor. Dr. Arni, who will replace the professor? The president ordered me to lead the excavation, starting today. What? Are you kidding me? A woman this young taking over? Thank you. That will be all. But, ma'am... Please, sir. A minute of your time. I'm sorry to bother you, but this is very important. Please, sir. What are you doing here? It's a waste of time. He refuses to talk. I've been here twice. I need to see the caretaker of Mount Padang. Good day, Mr. Iwan. My name is Guntur Samudra. I know who you are. But I'm afraid we don't have the same beliefs. Aren't all pure beliefs from the same source? That of God Almighty, He who created the universe? Your master has taught you well. Tell us what you know about Mount Padang, sir. The real name of Mount Padang is actually... Nagara Siang Padang. It means... -"Knowledge of the End of Time." -Which means? That within Mount Padang... lies knowledge that mankind will need at the end of time. Could it also mean that something inside the pyramid... could trigger the apocalypse? How did you summon the fire in your hand? Do you know why... I've never paid to be featured in your tabloid headlines? It's because you're incapable of believing in anything. That's how I'm different from the shamans you bribe. Well, excuse me for trying to earn a living. To you, if you can't see something then it doesn't exist. Things aren't that simple. Why do you expose yourself if you have such power? Starring in your own TV show, like a fraud? Like you said... everyone has to earn a living. Any more beer? -Damn! -Where are you going, Syam? To take a piss. Why, do you want to join me? Be careful. You don't want to run into a demon. They wouldn't dare! This spot will do. To all the demons and the devils, show yourself while I take a piss on your sorry asses. As if I care. What's that? I suggest all of you head back to Jakarta right away. We'll hold a press conference if there's any significant information to share. We cannot guarantee your safety here. Especially if the consumption of alcohol is involved, which could very much be the cause of this unfortunate incident here today. That will be all. Thank you. I am Guntur Samudra, and I can help you. Excuse us, sir. Dr. Arni is extremely busy. Any questions will be answered after the press conference. I understand that. But I just want to let you know that I have valuable information regarding Mount Padang. This pyramid isn't what you think it is. There's more to it. You're happy that somebody died? Now you can go and write your bizarre headlines. We don't need a shaman or a mystical tabloid reporter to help us out. What Indonesia needs is science... and not superstition. Good day. Thank you. It's late. We'll pick this up tomorrow. Yes, ma'am. Good night. Good night. I don't understand why the professor didn't share all of this with me. Maybe I'm not fit to lead this excavation. Don't say that. The president was insistent on appointing you as Professor Theo's successor. If you don't believe in the supernatural... why write about it? With that kind of logic... that means only women are allowed to sell bras. -Seriously. -I am being serious. I see. I don't really care what I write. As long as it pays, I'm in. I used to take my job seriously. I worked to to uncover corrupt bureaucrats, but in return, I got the magazine banned by the government. I was blacklisted. So why bother? The most important thing for me now is my daughter. Nothing else matters. Lila. So you really don't believe in anything? What? You mean God? These days, religion has been used time and again as an excuse for people to kill each other. War and destruction are everywhere. If God really exists... he wouldn't allow these monstrous things to happen, right? It's only a matter of time before this world meets its end. The world will end when all of us give up... and lose hope. Just like yourself. You said it yourself. The most important thing to you is Lila. Tell me, if the world ceases to exist, where does she end up? On Mars? I'm absolutely certain. Professor must have a good reason to keep all this. Including this? A pentagram? It's been used as a means of protection since ancient times by those with pagan beliefs. But what's the connection between the pentagram and the Mount Padang Pyramid? People used to consider the pyramid to be a mountain. That's why it was called Mount Padang. And Mount Padang is surrounded by five mountains. Mount Batu, Malang, Melati, Empet, Karuhun. Five. Penta. Just like the shape of our pyramid. So this pyramid was built in the center of these five mountains. That means whoever built this pyramid... is trying to keep it from being found. And for what other reason but to hide something valuable? That may be true. That's why it's so hard to find the entrance. It was intentionally hidden. Whatever the reason, we have to find that entrance. What's wrong? Nothing. Another victim. There are no signs of violence on the victim's body, ma'am. What then? We don't know, ma'am. The cause of death has yet to be determined. FORENSICS Each victims died unnaturally. Are you saying they were killed by demons? You may not believe it, Tom, but this is no coincidence. I'm accepting your offer to lend a hand. I don't believe in the supernatural... but how Wulan died is gravely mysterious. It's not the first time. Professor Theo, Syam... and now your friend. There's a spirit inside the pyramid... and it doesn't want you to find what's inside. Are you saying we have to stop the excavation? Come to think of it, many myths and legends are based on facts. These facts have been assimilated by local beliefs and superstitions. So why don't we just combine our expertise? With his special abilities, your archeological finding, and my extensive research on Mount Padang, together, we just might find the entrance to the pyramid. CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT: TIGER PAWS AT MOUNT PADANG SITE Why is the dig concentrated on this side of the wall? Why not try another side of the pyramid? The entrance might be elsewhere. Pyramid entrances around the world are all found on the north side. Why north? Because the people who built the Egyptian pyramids worshipped Ra, the god of the sun. Speaking of, the word Sunda includes the word "sun." Sun deity, solar deity. The god of the sun, Ra. They might the same thing under a different name. Lila. Hi, sweetie. What are you doing? I just finished my dancing lesson. Really? That's nice. Sorry, didn't know you were here. That's all right, I'm video-calling my daughter. This is Aunt Arni. She's Daddy's friend. -Say hi, sweetie. -Hi, Aunt Arni. Hi. Time for bed, sweetie. Daddy has to work. -Bye, sweetie. I love you. -I love you, Papa. -Your daughter is adorable. -Her name is Lila. She's three. By the way... Thanks for letting me be part of your team. The supporting data you've provided will be very helpful for my article. No complaints from the wife? I mean, you being out here for so long? I'm divorced. Sorry, I didn't mean to... It's fine. We just grew apart. It's Lila that I'm more concerned about now. My ex-wife thinks I should find another line of work. Frankly, I never expected a reporter for the Occult Magazine to be as resourceful as you are. I actually used to work for Generation magazine. Heard of it? The one that got banned by the government? Yes. You might say it was my fault. -That was you? -Yep. I remember reading about that case. No, that's all right. It taught me not to be naive. I've stop trying to be a hero. Nobody cares about heroes in this country. So from a hard-news journalist... to a reporter for Indonesia's supernatural magazine. That's a drastic change. You could say that. But the money's good. Arni... Our discussion yesterday about the worshippers of Ra... What if the people of Sundaland, or whoever built this pyramid, didn't worship the god of sun... but the total opposite? They actually want to avoid the sun. You mean they intentionally built the entrance on the south side? That's interesting. But the south side... is the pointed side of the pyramid. There's no wide access. It's possible that the entrance is so hidden that no one would ever find it. I can hear gusts of wind. What are you doing? It's a sequence code. The number 777 is a sacred number in Sundaland culture. Everyone, please be careful. Remember that we don't know what's inside. Wear your gas masks. Poisonous gas might still be circulating inside since it hasn't been opened for thousands of years. Okay. Let's go. Be careful. All right, the air is clean. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are at safe levels. Don, the sample bags. Don't touch it! The president greatly appreciates your team's hard work. But in light of all the incidents that have occurred, especially today's tragedy, he's extremely worried. That's why he gave a temporary order to close this site until it's absolutely certain to be safe. Tom... Here's your check from Jack Brown and the fee from the sponsors. "MOUNT PADANG" 450 MILLION RUPIAHS Thanks. Hey, listen. Do you ever believe any of the stories featured in our magazine? All that matters is if it sells. Is something wrong? Mount Padang. It's different from anything I've encountered before. What do you mean? There's actually a monster in there somewhere? It just feels different. Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's not important. You're the last one here, so don't forget to lock up. Okay. Is something wrong? That's odd. I've tested this dagger multiple times and the results are very strange. All the tests show that this dagger contains iron. But according to the X-rays, it seems to be entirely made of stone. Could it be because of the elevated presence of pyroxene andesite? That would explain a high concentration of iron. Yes, but this is over 70%. All right, I'm heading home. See you. STRANGE NOISES HEARD ALL AROUND THE WORLD All right, viewers. We will now begin the ritual. Are you ready, Mr. Guntur? I, Guntur Samudra... son of the soul of the universe... will exorcise all of the evil spirits straight to the hereafter. Viewers, what you are witnessing is the ritual performed by Mr. Guntur. It looks like he's trying to sense what kind of spirits resides in this building. I'm detecting an enormous energy coming from over there. Can you elaborate on what kind of energy? Where did it go? It's okay. Let's hope this is as important as you said it was on the phone. Have any of you experienced something unusual recently? I'm not sure if it's real or not. Look. I managed to take this picture. -The symbol of Badurakh. -What? Look at this. You still don't believe any of this is true, Tom? There's a fine line between being a skeptic and being an idiot. I saw something at home last night. I don't know what it was... but it wasn't human. I definitely saw something, but I couldn't make it out. It's a djinn. Badurakh. The keeper of Mount Padang. That's what you probably saw. But if it really was the keeper of Mount Padang, why is he here? If this Badurakh is revealing himself... to the three of us, what's his motive? Let's meet back here later. My advice? If you've never prayed in your life... now would be a good time to start. Why are you here again? What is it now? No, please. I need you to listen to me. Something is following me, and it's very disturbing. Something, as in a ghost? You might find this hard to believe. I didn't believe it at first. But this is really happening. Something following me from Mount Padang. It's an evil entity. That's why I'm concerned for the safety of you and Lila. Wait. This is for you and Lila. 450 MILLION RUPIAHS Will you let me see Lila for just a moment? I miss you so much, sweetie. I know I'm not a father she can be proud of. But I'll always take care of this family. In 1914, Dutch archaeological teams found something at Mount Padang. Djinn. But what's this? There's something I need to tell you, guys. -All right, you go first. -Okay. The stone dagger is actually a key. There's an intricate inscription that's almost invisible. I cross-referenced it with the ancient language we deciphered. The inscription reads, "The Key to Firegate." According to ancient beliefs, Firegate may well be-- Hell. If my research is correct... Mount Padang's purpose may not be to keep people out. Rather, the pyramid was built to make sure whatever's inside doesn't get out. And inside the pyramid resides one of the most ancient demons of all. It's not the Badurakh. He's insignificant compared to the real demon lying deep inside. All the incidents that happened at Mount Padang... that was Badurakh's doing. He's collecting souls to restore his master's strength. And now, the demon is strong enough to free himself from the pyramid. If he succeeds... the world will come to an end. Mommy! Hello? Tomo! Please come. Help us. Lila... Lila, sweetie. Are you all right? Don't worry. Daddy will protect you. Nothing will hurt you. Yes, Daddy. You can't stay here tonight. Yes, I've already called my uncle. We're going to stay there tonight. What are you going to do? Anything to keep you safe. Nothing will harm you ever again. Please be careful. Those symbols. Badurakh wants us to see these symbols. The Devil. If the Devil is real... Then the God who created him must be real, too. I don't believe God would let all this happen. I remember an ancient legend stating that there are three chosen ones... sent by God to close the gates of Hell. So you're saying... we're the chosen ones? Badurakh wants us to see these symbols. I always need money. Guntur... He's successful and famous. Gospel is usually identified with religious faith. But nowadays it can also represent knowledge. That's you, Arni. This isn't a coincidence. The three of us represent gold, glory and gospel. Gold, glory and gospel. We need to return to the pyramid. It's not going to be easy. The Devil may be luring us there... to help him open the gates of Hell. So be it. What's important is the well-being of Lila. Even if that means sacrificing your own life? I would do anything for Lila. Let's do this. I, Guntur Samudra... son of the soul of the universe... will exorcise all of the evil spirits straight to the hereafter. You do know there aren't any cameras? It gets me motivated. Where to? Pyramids always contain something sacred and valuable in the main chamber. The main chamber of this pyramid is on the fifth level below, right in the center of the pyramid. This is where we descend to level two. "He will rise again." Wait. Badurakh. We have to hurry to the main chamber. Arni! Tomo! Where are you? Arni! Guntur! Where's Guntur? I don't know. We got separated. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Run! Where does this door lead to? I'm pretty sure this is the door to the main chamber. There must be a way to open it. Find another entrance. I'll try to hold him off. Guntur! Oh, my God. Close the Firegate with this dagger. Finish it, Tom. I, Guntur Samudra... son of the soul of the universe... will exorcise all of the evil spirits... straight to the hereafter. We're not finished yet. Tomo! They can't hear you. Who are you? I've been known by a lot of names. Depends on the era. Depends on who's calling on me. Am I dead? Not quite. This is neither Heaven nor Hell. Do you know why you're here? -To save my daughter. -From what? The apocalypse? What do you think will happen at the end of days? Everything will be destroyed? That's a lie. An apocalypse is actually an exchange of power. An apocalypse means it's my turn to rule the world. It's time for the world to be led by someone who understands the weakness of man. Not only understands... but also values all of mankind's desires... and will lead them on a more logical path. Isn't that what mankind has always wanted? You'd say anything. Isn't that what you're good at? Manipulating people? You know what I like about you? You can tell the difference between what's important and what should be left to rot. You realize that there's no use in fighting for ideals if no one gives a damn. You wanted to expose corruption. Do the right thing. And what happened? You lost everything. Now tell me, is that fair? Now's the time for a new world order. I'm going to change everything. No more doubt. All that will matter is what you can see and feel. Material things. Unlike now, where you're forced to have faith in something you can't even see... and forced to do things that don't make sense. You know... I could give you all that your heart desires. Unlimited wealth... or anything you want. But I know that all of those things don't matter to you. I know what matters most to you. Lila! Don't you want to live with your daughter again? You know... I can easily make all of your dreams come true. You don't have to worry about your daughter's custody. I could make your wife take you back. What kind of world would you be ruling? All the scriptures state the world will perish when you take over. History is written by the victors. Perhaps I lost, ages ago, to Him. But tell me now, how many people are claiming to worship Him while they practice my teachings? I have a lot more followers than He does. And this time, I will surely win. What about Lila? What's in her future? Everything. Wealth, a great career, a luxurious home. Everything good that this world offers would be given to her instantly. At this very moment. What about love? Love? Love is merely an illusion. Lila doesn't need all that. The purest love... is loving yourself. I'll give your daughter anything her heart desires. She won't need anybody else. All you have to do is-- I become your follower. That's right. But of your own free will. I want all my followers to willingly and voluntarily follow me. To believe my way is the better way. Come on, Tomo. Let's change the world. Help me open the Firegate. Come on, Tom. You have what I need. First... give me that dagger. Let's open the Firegate together. Let's start a new and better era. Without love, there's no future for mankind. You stupid human! I think you've succeeded closing the Firegate. Tom. Tomo, hang on. Come on, we have to get out of here. Arni... please... take care of Lila... for me. Please tell her how sorry I am. I can't be with her anymore. No, Tomo. You're going to make it. For Lila. Come on, Tomo. Get up! Please, let's just go. No, Arni... You have to go. You wouldn't believe what I just saw. Leave me here. Go on, save yourself. Thank you. It's hard to keep hope alive... when all you see is destruction. But we need to keep our hope alive. Keep believing that kindness is more powerful than anything, even if sometimes we find it hard to be kind. Even if our kindness will be forgotten in a blink of an eye. Even if no one notices our act of kindness. Keep on being kind. Losing faith in kindness means we've given up on ourselves, lost faith that tomorrow will be a better day. I'm so sorry I can't be with you anymore... but you'll always be in my thoughts. Have faith, sweetie. Someday we'll be reunited... and live in happiness, forever. MOUNT PADANG SITE IS CLOSED FOR SECURITY REASON
