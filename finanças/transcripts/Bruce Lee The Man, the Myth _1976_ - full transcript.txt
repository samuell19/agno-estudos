Narrator: Enumerable legends have surrounded the life and death of Bruce Lee, the greatest martial arts fighter of all time whose extraordinary accomplishments dazzled the world both on screen and in real life. Never before in the history of ritual combat has one name been so well known and meant so much to so many. This is Bruce Lee's story. To those who follow in his respected tradition and to Bruce Lee himself this film is proudly dedicated. You know, I heard you had a fight today. Bruce, tell me, what is the matter? I have to... go to America tomorrow. Ip: Oh? Why do you go there? Mother wants me to. What she thinks is that America's different. She is insisting. What am I expected to do? I don't wanna study in America. I wanna stay in Hong Kong. Master, what can I do to thank you for your teaching? You know, I cannot have you say goodbye like that. Now that you have to go away, what happens as you're traveling I know will bring many good things. I'm going in spirit beside you. You know, you can teach kung fu all over the world. You can bring honor to your people. I do what you say. Master, can we practice one last time? Hey, Bruce. Hey, remember last week, that move I showed you, you've been practicing? Not that much, but when I've got it together, I'm gonna try and challenge you. Oh, I've got to tell you though you could be really good at it. I hope so, Bruce, but before that, I could use a few more classes. - My pleasure. - You got it. - Woman: Hey Bruce. - Man: Hey, hey, hey. - Bruce: Hi. - Woman: Hey, Bruce. Hey, Bruce, how are you doing? You're a hard guy to get a hold of, man. - Who, me? - Yeah, that's right. You're always pulling some kind of disappearing act. Hey, wait, let me show you something. - Got a coin? - Man: Yeah, I do, right here. Let me see. Here it is. Watch that money. I'm gonna take it. Woman: Uh... Oh, all right, open your hand. - Woman: Oh. - Man: Wow. - Woman: All right. - Man: All right. - Man: All right, Bruce. - Man: Hey, not bad at all. Man: Hey, Bruce, I wanna learn some of that stuff too. Next class, why don't you come? Man: Bye, bye, take it easy. See you later. - Okay. - Man: I'll see you later. Man: That's right. Goodbye ladies, all right? - Woman: Bye. - Man: That's all those guys do is party. They're on their way over to Charlie's right now, get high. You know, I'd like to go but I can't. Well, why can't you, Bruce? I got work to do and, you see, I have got to keep in shape. You know how hard I work. That'll be $5. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Philip: Hiya, Bruce. - Hi. Hey, Phillip, have you heard anything from your son who lives in New York recently? Yeah. I finally got a letter from him last week. He finally got a job in Manhattan. Hey, that's good news. Yeah, sure is. He's been trying a long time. Hey, Bruce, I hear you run a martial arts studio. Are you really teaching Kung Fu? Yeah. Hey, if you would like to learn Kung Fu, I will teach you. No, come on. I'm too old to start now. Oh, but it's never too late. Oh, excuse me. Yes, sir. Fill it up? Man: Hey. Hey. Come here, you son of a bitch. Get over here, you bastard. Please don't. - Where's that money? - I don't have it. I need more time. Two days, I'll get it for you. - No way. - Man: Let me at him. Why don't you beat it, chink. You'll see what I can do if you get closer. Please don't. Don't, Bruce. That guy's a karate expert. Please don't fight him. Don't, Bruce. Don't, Bruce. Don't. Don't you know anything about karate, Phillip? It came from Kung Fu used in China, so I'm not afraid to fight this guy I don't believe it. Man: Fight! Two points! Kung fu is the use of special skills. In theory, it is simple. There are not only physical movements to do, but in kung fu, the mind must walk in unison with the body to achieve true concentration. Kung fu is a way of life, not merely fighting. Its purpose is not to destroy. It is philosophy, a vital part of Taoism and Buddhism. One branch of kung fu is strong and hard, the other is weak and soft. The first aims at strength, speed. The other, at thinking and the body. Traditional kung fu movements are grouped according to the section of the body you want to attack. These groups are good in practice, but a real fight is different. Your opponent will be constantly moving to avoid you. You must be flexible, remain alert, and remember, he is alive and moving at all times, so all of your movements must be simple and direct. Master, what does direct mean? Direct means not wasting time. Doing what you got to do, you know, without having to stop. Now in this case, when he saw the watch dropping, had he dropped to the ground to catch it or moved around, he would have missed it. He made the most direct... You have to make a direct move when you attack an opponent. Care to join us, boys? Don't forget though what you are doing. The answer is here in your brain. Bruce Lee! I hear you said that karate is far from as good as kung fu. It is. You know it. All right. Let me try some of your kung fu. So which one is first? No, not today. Meet me at Duquesne College Stadium tomorrow. I would like to have my students see firsthand that Japanese karate is superior to Chinese kung fu. Man: All right. All of you take your seats up there. You know Bruce is gonna beat this Murayaki. They both are good. This is gonna be a real match. Hey, where could Bruce be? Uh, he should be here any minute. Who sent you to get me? Murayaki. I'm sure Bruce Lee has changed his mind about coming. He won't think kung fu is better than karate now. Listen. Bruce Lee is not here because he is afraid. He is afraid of your instructor. I now declare... Murayaki the winner! Hey. All right. You are the greatest. If I was Bruce Lee, I wouldn't have shown up either. Karate always beats kung fu. Really, really. Wait a minute! If you're all going home, there isn't any winner. Now, to get this whole thing settled, pretend that I'm Bruce Lee. Would you use kung fu against me? If I have to. Okay. My students can watch me win after all. Now we're talking! Let's go! Master. It's okay. What's he done, Mr. Karate? He said you're afraid to fight. - Was he laughing? - Right. You challenge my student? Sure. Now you can see karate is best. Although I've lost, I still refuse to say that karate came from kung fu. You keep insisting on this. You'll never understand you're hopeless in this art. Bruce Lee, this time you have won. This makes me appear very bad to my students. Someday, I'll get my revenge. Narrator: After completing his studies at the university, Bruce left Seattle to join his best friend in San Francisco where he developed and expanded the unique kung fu styles which are now recognized as classic Bruce Lee techniques. Bruce, I can't tell you how good it is to see you. You know, when my students found out you're in town, they got all excited. You've got to demonstrate some kung fu for them. Okay. Anytime you say. Oh, great! You'll love Chinatown, Bruce. It's really far out. Butchie: The schools here are so conservative. Only Chinese students are accepted here for kung fu classes. But you said in your last letter that you started accepting American students. Yeah. But they stopped me. Really? How? Well, Sum Tai Mo told me not to take any more American students, just Chinese. But who's Sum Tai Mo? He's from Hong Kong and he really knows his kung fu, plus he's connected. It is Sum Tai Mo. We should go. Come on, Bruce. What I'd like to see is just how much he knows. Well, what do you know, the great fighter, Bruce Lee. What I say comes from in here. Now listen to me both of you and do what I say. When I say move, do it when you stay around here. Oh, is that right? Yes. Ordinarily, well, I wouldn't say you had a prayer, but you could go around the corner and practice. Well, what do you think of the nightlife - here in San Francisco? - Oh, it's great. But this looks like the hooker district here. Yeah. Hey, let's go in. No. Not me. You know, your kung fu is really amazing. - Hmm. - How you comin' along with that new style? What do you call it, - Jeet Kune Do? - Yeah. That's it. That's just what I call it, Jeet Kune Do. But, you know, every form has an inherent weakness. Hmm. Look, don't worry about the forms. Speed, that's the thing that counts, that's what matters, be fast. - Hmm. - Hey, did I tell you that I'm going to the Karate Championship... - What? Really? - In Long Beach? Hey, you're really gonna be well-known. Good going. Hey, can I come too? Bruce: Sure. Woman over P.A.: Be right back. I'm going to the john. Woman over P.A.: Got a light? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Woman over P.A.: What? Woman over P.A.: These boys were sent for that damn Murayaki. But I know what to do because I won't let them do this to me. Narrator: Bruce Lee's now legendary performances at the International Karate matches in 1964 in Long Beach, California brought him worldwide recognition and dramatically altered the course of his professional life. With an outstanding display of speed, strength, and skill, he captured both the championship title and the attention of the entertainment industry. Shortly thereafter, he was signed for his first television role as Kato in "The Green Hornet". Other TV outlet's were not yet ready to acknowledge Bruce Lee as a potential superstar. You see what I was talking about here? You need an Eastern pro for this role. It would be so real. It should be somebody who can really do it, you know, heh, a martial arts expert. Well, Bruce, I looked very carefully over the script and I'm really very impressed with the effort that you put into it. But the problem... is you have to realize something, be pretty hard for you to sell it. I don't like to say it, but nobody wants to invest money in a relatively new Chinese actor. Narrator: Bruce Lee realizes things the establishment could not foresee but what he already knew. He had lost the battle but not the war. Hey, Butchie. Bruce. - Hey, Bruce. - Butchie. I just got here. Perfect timing. Come on, come on. I'll show you around. Butchie: Oh, the studio? Bruce: Yeah. Bruce, how do you like living in LA? Huh? Oh, it's great. You got everything happening here. I mean, look at this, got everything you could want. It's fantastic, but I think that the next month I'm going back to Hong Kong. Butchie: What are you talking about? You got it made here. No, Butchie, you don't understand why I have to go back there. All you get here is non-speaking roles. I can't do a pod with a pigtail hanging down. But wait until they see what I can do... with Jeet Kune Do. They'll have a new image for the Chinese people. Hey, hello. Hey. Wow. You look like you've struck it rich, huh? Yeah. Well-known perhaps, not rich. I don't believe that, Bruce. Come on, I know better. No. You must be crazy. How are you? What about your luggage? Ah. That's all you got? Hong Kong has really changed. Yeah, it has. How long are you planning on staying? That depends on business. Hey, you know, your shows are the most popular on Hong Kong TV, "Longstreet" and "The Green Hornet". Really? Yeah? Yeah. You wouldn't kid me. Not a chance. I never kid with you. I wish there was a way that I could get a movie made. Oh? But what about your Hollywood people? You must be high. American producers won't just give you money to make a movie. That's it. So, I'm not sure how, but I'm gonna get it. Man: Hey, you. What are you doing down here? - Come on. Get back up there. - Wait a minute. - Back to work. - Calm down. No time to stand, you do what I tell you. I don't have to listen to this. I've been working here all day. You get paid to work here. Not stand around. Don't you trick me. Who do you think you are? - You see this fist? - I see. So what? So you better watch your mouth. That's why. All right. Cut it. That's fine. Jonathan. Here, give them the next scene. Tell Bruce to work out his fighting moves up there. Go ahead. Jonathan: Mr. Lee, the director wants you to rehearse your fight now. Right over here, if you'll please. Okay. Now, you hit me with the stick here, right? Right. Then one, two, three, four. Right. Now remember what we did? Then one, okay? Bruce: You move over here. Get a load of that guy. - Man, is that all there is? - Bruce: Go around. Oh, really? I know him. I've watched him compete. - Not bad either. - Ooh. Ooh. That's it. All right. Move in now. I really like him. I want to see him box. Hey, I bet I could out dance that guy. Man: Wait a minute. No, really. I'm not fooling about it. I could knock him out. You know what? You talk like you really been around. Yeah? What about it? Well, you should know Bruce Lee. And maybe you should know how to box. We have to finish this whole thing by tonight. Go break that up. Come on. - Hey, wait a minute, don't do it. - Do not fight him. He's a Thai boxer. Then I'm gonna show him Jeet Kune Do. Oh, sir, that guy is dangerous. You got to be careful. Don: Alright. Keep your left up. - All right. - You got to help. Brother, come and help. Some Chinese guy beat me up. How could that be? He used kung fu. Hear that? What about Thai boxing? How could that happen? I'll be by now. Who could do that to a Thai boxer? Some kind of actor. Come on, boy. Stop that lying. What was I supposed to do about that? He put down Thai boxing. He got me so mad. Don, Gi and I will go and get him. - Come on. - Hey. Have him meet us at the temple garden. I'll make him pay. Get a note to the man. - Jonathan. - Uh-hmm. Do you think "The Big Boss" is gonna be a hit? Oh, sure it will. How can it miss? You did a good job. I wanna do more. There's another film coming up. And I know you're gonna star in it. Bruce: That's not enough. I wanna make big films to reach the whole world, you know what I mean? Hey, you're not in America now. It takes a lot of money to do that. You're doing all right. - Oh. - Don't worry about it. - Listen to me. - Come on. - You're kidding. - One step at a time. I know what I'm talking about. I've been in this business all my life. - Look there, for instance. - Boy: Mister, - are you Bruce Lee? - Uh-hmm. They told me to give this to you. Wait a minute. This is from those Thai boxers. They want you to fight them. Where? The old temple. Take me where I can see some real Thai boxing. Okay. Hey. Did you see the way he kicked him? They do that in Thai boxing. And they use the elbows. They're weapons, too. Look. Bruce Lee. I came to show you the art of Thai boxing and keep up our honor. We'll not be attacked like that. Jeet Kune Do will outrank it. If you wanna know, test me. Don: Get him. Bruce Lee, I can see why kung fu is better. So next time, you listen to me because I'm not doing the talking here, kung fu is. Bruce: Tonight was the opening of "The Big Boss". It was a great success. I can't forget how hard it's been but somehow, tonight, it all seems easy. It will be pretty hard for you to sell it. I don't like to say it, but nobody wants to invest money in a relatively new Chinese actor. Bruce, the children wanted to say goodnight to you. Where are you going? I'm going to work out. - Now? - Yes. Say good night to your daddy. - Good night, Daddy. - Good night, Daddy. Good night. - We love you, Daddy. - We love you, Daddy. See you later, honey. Hey, Charlie. Take a look. Am I wrong or is that Bruce Lee jogging? - Sure is. - Alright. - Hi. - Hey, aren't you Bruce Lee? - Hey, good morning. - Cigarette? No, thank you. "Fist of Fury" was a beautiful movie. - I love that movie. - I saw it two times. Man: Oh, yeah. - Not bad, huh? - Yes. Perfect. He wants to be your bodyguard. Get out of here. Chinese are no longer thought of as weak. Man: That's just like in "Fist of Fury". Say, Charlie, what about the move you showed me over at your house? Tell him about that. Uh, come on, I'm not that good. Hey, yeah, let's have a look at it. Okay. Watch this. Keep it up, hmm? You see that? You're wide open. Hmm? Got to watch that. Bend your legs, stay low. Be ready. - Like that. - Man: Hop, two, three, four... Bruce: You must follow through. Like this. Let me show you. Hey, you better move that barricade - before they get here. - Bruce: Like that, you see? Just stay balanced and keep it... Man: three, four. Hop, two, three, four. You see those guys over there? They took our barricades and threw it across the road. Hop, hop, hop, two, three, four. Hop. Hop, hop, hop, two, three, four. - Don't move it. - Man: Hop, two, three, four. Hop, two, three, four. Hop, two, three, four. Hop, two, three, four. Hop, two, three, four. Hop, two, three... Team, halt. All right, fellas, move that barricade out of the way. Go on. All right. All right, fellas, come on. Go around. Move that thing. - No, you don't. - Huh? Push it or move it back and Charlie's gonna stop you. Get a load of that lad. Hey, you're in China. We'll see. Get him. Charge. You dirty little bleeder, you nasty little piece of work. All right, come on. Come on. Alright. Not with your feet, but can you hit? Bleeder, bring it here. Hey, Charlie, I'll take three pieces. Alright. Man: Come on, lads. - Here you go, sweetie. - Oh. Thanks, hon. Gotta talk to you! - Hey. What's up? - Hi, Bruce. I'm glad I caught you here. You're really too much. You want a drink? - Try it. - Hey, no. Come on now. I can't drink that stuff. You ought to know better. It's good for you, though. Hey, no. I bet it's good. You have something to say? I've been hearing stories from many people - about you and Chang. - Yeah? - Man: You're gonna fight him? - Yes. Really? Come on, now boy, Chan can gain from a fight, although you know you have a lot to lose. What's the difference what he has to gain? The point is that important people will want to see it. That's good for me. I was counting on you to stay on my side. Man: Oh, you can, Bruce, of course. I knew it. - Now, remember our plan? - Man: I sure do. Bruce: This is the day for it. There's Chan with his master. Mr. Chan, I would like to introduce Mr. Hun Ben Yu who is happy to be here today with us. - Hello. - How do you do? And this is Master Lee, Mr. Chan's honorable instructor. - How do you do? - Hello. And Inspector Lau. Can we start the match? Yes, of course, right away. Bruce Lee is right up there. Inspector Lau, Master Lee. The camera comes in from here, then I hit this guy, - then I move... - Hmm, look. I just had one more idea for the end of the fight scene, but we better talk about it later. Bruce Lee, Inspector Lau. - How do you do? - Hello? And now, I would like to introduce you to Mr. Chan. Can I talk to you, gentlemen, in a minute, please? You see, gentlemen... I don't wanna fight this guy. You're kidding. If it makes some sense, but it doesn't. You know he's no competition. Hun Ben Yu! It is needless to try to go on with him now. We wouldn't want to force him. He's just too delicate now to have a real fight. How much does it cost to have him fight in the movies, huh? You are right, my friend. He fights only in the movie. I could tell. His kung fu was always show. Chan is the winner. Both of you hold it. Showtime. - Come. - You have to prove that you're better than him. Now you remember, keep your eyes on his legs. Don't let him use them against you and stay down. We need three sets of nunchakus in the scene, and three guys who really know how to use them. All right. Now if you can move in and get close enough so you can get control of him, then I want you to grab him then throw him down, but be careful. Don't let him get you with his feet. And I'm gonna depend on you to talk the producer into it. Uh-hmm. Hey, don't forget the fight. Excuse me? Uh... Oh, good thinking. Hey, did you bring the bandages? Yeah, I sure did. Do you know what to do with them? I give them to you. Okay. But not for me. That guy there. Oh. So... go ahead. Master Lee: Now remember, keep your eyes on his legs. Don't let him use them against you. So you fear my legs. Now, you know these are just as deadly. Narrator: Bruce Lee drove himself relentlessly to attain the highest level martial arts performances ever seen, onscreen or off. Narrator: Then, his box office potential finally recognized, Bruce Lee began directing films around the world. Bruce: Be sure to tell me if they do come back, and I'll fix them permanently. Man: Okay. All right. Cut. - Bruce: Were you framed to here? - Man: Right, we got it. - Bruce: Oh, great. - Woman: Was that really okay? Bruce: Come on, you earned a rest. You were just fine. - I want you to go over your lines with Carol. - Carol: Do you know your lines? - Camera man: Get me another magazine. - Man: Okay. - Bruce: Can I see? - Camera man: Sure. Woman: I'm not sure about the scenes in the bedroom. Carol: Well, then let's take it from the top. - Bruce: You're sure you had her framed here? - Camera man: Absolutely. - No question about it. - Bruce: Okay, that's right. - Man 1: Okay. - Man 2: Watch out for that cable. Bruce, we're going into overtime. Wrap it, then. All right. It's a wrap, let's go. You can break it down now. Man: All right. It's a wrap. Man: Where are you going? Hey, tomorrow, we gotta shoot over at the Coliseum. So I gotta go see it. Okay. So, would you do me a favor and leave the keys in the car. Yeah, I'll pull it around. Okay. Uh, you boys after me? You bet it, so be a good boy. Hey, I won't do anything. Right. Do what you're told. Oh, I'll take it really easy with you guys. You got that thing. What do you expect me to do without a gun, hmm? Just don't forget that. We don't expect you to do nothing. Just what do you guys want with me? A friend of ours wants to see you. Well, so you're Bruce Lee. Yes. My captor is very lovely. I must tell you, but you know of course that I'm married. Yes, Bruce, spoken very graciously. You must have guessed that I wanted to know more about you and your kung fu. It certainly is... very sweet. I understand that about three years ago you had a match in America against an Italian and you beat him. My father lost a lot of money on that fight. Yeah, but did you know who wanted it? Them, not me. They were the ones who were behind it. If it were up to me, you wouldn't be made to pay. I guess you know it's my father who insists. You don't have to say that. You know, it's all right. For you, it would be only one more match but if you could be persuaded to do it. To do what? It will be a match that proves to everybody how good your kung fu is. If you can prove yourself, Father will believe the fight wasn't fixed. You will have to fight three of his best men, and I hope you win. Let's just hope they're good enough... so it's worth it for me. Bruce Lee, I have heard about your many accomplishments. I've been looking forward to this for quite some time. It seems you put my people through a great deal of trouble in the United States. We are here for a test, to see if I wasn't right. Papa, don't you think that Bruce Lee is very good? Bruce, stop. Bruce Lee, my friend, your kung fu is really classic. You have proven to be a truly formidable opponent. No doubt remains in my mind about the tales of the Chinese philosophers. Bruce Lee, you will be a Chinese hero. You will conquer the Western world. Hello? Man over phone: Bruce Lee. Who's calling? Man over phone: A friend. Wait just a moment, please. It sounds like the same man who's been calling. Hello? Man over phone: Is this Bruce Lee? Yeah. Who is this? Man over phone: This is the man who will defeat you. You won't have a chance. Man over phone: Don't bet on that. Now, what do you say to that? I taught them all I knew about kung fu. I could teach you. Cut. We'll need the zoom for this, Frank. We'll take it from right about right here. Thank you. Bruce: No, no. I'll show you. Stay focused. Keep it light and snap it. - Look. - We'll get him. Straight out like that. Now, you try. But always be ready. Do you mean that? Didn't it look like I did? Man: Stay out of it. It's none of your business. Hold it. Man: Stay there. You think you're gonna force a fight, but not this time. I am not playing with you, you know. The threatening call yesterday on the telephone, you're the guy that did it, hmm? I admit it. The great master Bruce Lee refuses to fight with me. I think he's afraid. Is that what you believe? Yup. We could tell. "We," huh? Big man. I could take you all alone. Now, you, me, and them? Only if you need them. So, had enough? No more. One more time. Yes. Run. You shall die young and live again. Man: Before these things happen, you'll become seriously ill. Bruce, I will tell you. You don't have very long. - Ray over phone: Hello? - Ray, I just wanted to let you know that I have the final plans for the new movie. What I must ask you to do now, today, is go and solidify my shooting dates. Ray over phone: Right I'll confirm them with you tomorrow. By the way, have you thought of a title yet? Sure, it's, uh, The Game of Death. This script is pretty good. The Tower of Death scene is my favorite one. Uh-hmm. But first I'd like your husband to help out. The film script still needs to be altered just a bit. There's a scene where we see me, - I'm reaching out. - Uh-huh. By the way, where's your husband gone to? Tell me. What's the matter? My husband will be back real soon. Here you are. This will make you feel better. Okay. Would you take it? - You try to rest now. - All right. All right? Woman: Bruce, are you feeling better now? It's time to get up. Oh, come on. What's the matter? What's the matter? Wake up. Oh, my God, wake up. Narrator: Thus ends the life of Bruce Lee, dead at age 35, struck down in the prime of life, defeated by the only power mightier than his own. As with all great men, Bruce Lee's sudden untimely death gave rise to countless unproven rumors such as these... Come on, let's get out of here. You know your destiny is pre-arranged and your life in this world will end at 35. With help, I hoped I could survive that. Fate changes you. You cannot change it. There just has to be a way. There is a way, isn't there? Yes, you must announce that you are dead. Your wife, your children, your friend, and above all your work, that's gone. You will leave as a recluse for 10 years. Narrator: Many believe Bruce Lee is still alive, a recluse preparing to return in 1983, 10 years from the day of his disappearance. This rumor is widespread in Southeast Asia, where his followers await his return. Narrator: Bruce Lee's legacy holds riches beyond his exceptional martial arts techniques. An incomparable fighter with unquenchable spirit, Bruce Lee will be a hard man to follow.
