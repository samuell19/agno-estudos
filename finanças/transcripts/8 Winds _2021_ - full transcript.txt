Marina del Rey. Hell. I was stuck. It didn't matter where I was, I was stuck but good. The cinema is a brutal mistress. She seduces and tantalizes your imagination with great movements of spectacle and human fury. And then when you embrace her, she abandons you to the gossamer embers of the seduction and the possibilities to come. But they never do come. Oh, I chased her with all I could ever muster, always climbing to the promised land where your shit doesn't stink. You get your money for nothing. Then I figured it out. Even if I got there, it wouldn't fulfill me. An ethereal illusion with certain disappointment. In the end, it just left me with dread. Unspecific, smoldering, ever-present and unknown. Dread. There are rumors, they are true. Board members and minority shareholders see it in their best interest to sell to us, but only if he is not in the way. It's a lot of fuss over water. Control the water, control the economy. You understand? Control everything. But we need your expertise. For a price. That goes without saying. He's not an easy man to find. No, but it must be soon. Things are in motion that would frustrate our plans. I am sure you will find a way. There will be many rewards. Perhaps maybe their decision-making process was not the best choice at the time, but I have nothing to add other than what's in the film. It was perverse. There I was being celebrated, when with a few hiccups, I could be penniless and homeless. What will happen to me? The march of time has exacted a perverse and stiff ransom. And now, I am passed over and ignored. Tossed aside like an empty beer can on the side of a highway. Look for the signs and wonders. That's the best I could come up with. Look for the signs. I try man, I try. The more gray hairs I get, the less the phone rings. I have to fight to keep my edge, try new things, challenge myself to learn new skills. The smallest act brings the greatest treasure. The readiness is all. Dare the dread. Fight for justice. Take action, always take action. Tell me about your favorite food. Great, I like them too. Where's your favorite place to get them? why there? When was the last time you were there? Are you afraid to go out now? Why? Why don't you feel safe anymore? Who attacked you? Who else? You said you had been attacked? Is it okay if I clip this mic? Hey, could you say something, so I can get a level? Tell me about your favorite food. Oh, that's a good one. They're my favorite too. Where do you go to get 'em? What's your favorite place? Hello? Yeah, yeah, that's me every day. Well, I'm kinda booked up today. What's this about? You're not gonna tell me till I get there. Well, hold on, let me check my calendar. Yeah, I can move some stuff around. Okay, great. You're gonna send a car for me. All righty. And hey, what's your name by the way? Natalie? Well, it's nice to meet you Natalie. I'll see you in a little while. Whoa. Christ, they sent a Trumpet. Are you Charlie? That's me every day. - How are you doing today? - I'm good. Good, that's actually terrific. Would you like a water? If that water is so wise, what's it doing inside the bottle? You look kinda familiar. Are you an actor? Sometimes. Oh yeah? What have I seen you in? Well, unless you were an insomniac in the former Soviet Republic, you probably haven't seen any of my films. Oh, okay, so Russia. They're cool. They're actually our best allies, so. Oh yeah, who told you that? Well, the president said so. What about their support of the dictator Assad, their expansion into the Ukraine? Where did you hear that from? History. It's all over the news. Must be fake news. Oh yeah, that's what it must be. And California farmers may get some drought relief from an unexpected source. There are rumors that reclusive billionaire, John T. Conover, who built his empire on the Wise Water brand, may allow farmers across the state to use his newly discovered vast underground reservoir in the central valley to water their crops. This comes as a surprise since many observers expected the shrewd dealmaker to sell his water rights to the Aquavelt Corporation, a Russian conglomerate whose shareholders are not known to the public, at very high premium. I was going to meet Boris Levashov. Not much was known about his background. He appeared on the Hollywood scene out of the blue with a lot of juice. He was Russian, maybe Ukrainian. He could've been from Long Island. Some called him a fixer, most just called him. Girls, guns, gambling, cars, politics. They said if he entered a revolving door behind you, he would come out in front of you. Why he was calling me I didn't know, but he was calling me. It couldn't hurt to meet and see what he was cooking. All right, okay, well, we're here. Let's make America great again, am I right? If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him. Mr. Nabis, hi, I'm Natalie, Mr. Levashov's assistant. Oh, nice to meet you. Can I get you a beverage? Ah, no thanks, I'm good. I was born that way actually. Mr. Nabis, I really enjoyed your film "The Next Message." It just really kept me guessing. I'll be back with Mr. Levashov. I'll be here, I promise. Charlie Nabis, you are here. - Boris. - Sit, sit. Nice to meet you. Indeed. Charlie, I saw your film on YouTube, "I Accuse." It's very powerful stuff. You have a wonderful touch for humanity. It's in all of your films. These are troubling times, and I thought I had to do something. Yes, yes, these are very bad times. But it give me an idea. What do you have in mind? What do you know about John T. Conover? - The reclusive billionaire? - Yes, him. Hasn't been seen for a decade, not even privately. He's a ghost, a myth. Yes, exactly. Would you like to interview him? How much? Oh, a man of commerce. Just like you, Boris. If you don't pay me, you'll never respect me. Very true statement. Let's say that my associates, they're very interested in bringing his story to the screen. And you would have to go find him all by yourself. A documentary? Would 50,000 be acceptable? What are my time constraints? Immediacy is very important. So you want me to find a guy that doesn't wanna be found, get him to agree to be filmed for an interview when he hasn't let anyone take his picture in a decade, just like that? I see your point. The money will be pay or play, guaranteed. A 100 grand in escrow and I have final cut. I'll do you one better. I'll give you half within 24 hours, the other half to be released when you deliver the interview. Just the interview and not the whole film? Exactly. That's odd, Boris. Well I'm a bit of an odd guy. Do we have a deal? If the money's there tomorrow in certified funds with a signed escrow agreement? Yeah, I'll play. Excellent. I will have Natalie bring your car around. Very nice doing business with you, Charlie Nabis. - Thank you. - Thank you. It's pretty. It sure is. Some advice? What? If you write a powerful letter about why you want to interview him, we can get it to someone. Who knows? Sounds like a scheme. Your car is here. You look familiar. You make movies? Sometimes. You direct? I have been known to direct traffic from time to time. Wise Water? No thanks. Are you a Trump fan? He's fantastic. The guy's basically running the country, you know? Sometimes in D.C., sometimes he's in Florida. What the hell did I just say yes to? What can I say? Money talks. I could live off of that for a year. Another fucking year. Trump's notifications ready to go, so that way any time he tweets, I can always just see what he's up to. You know, I love his tweets... From The Three Penny Opera, first feed the face, then choose right or wrong. Brecht, you are my absolver! How do you find a man who doesn't want to be found? You don't. You find a way to be found by him. Hey, it's Charlie Nabis, how you doing, man? I'm doing this really interesting project about John Conover. I was thinking maybe you could give me some ideas on where I might look. Hi, my name is Charlie Nabis. I'd like to speak to Efraim, but I'm making a movie about John Conover, Who used to work for him. I was wondering if maybe he could give me some ideas on where I might find him. Oh. But you used to represent him. Any ideas? Tell me about that. All right, well that helps. Someone told me he used to go to that club and hide out in the back. Okay. So it's true. You're in the spotlight now, baby! Be great immediately. Thank you. Hi, I'm Charlie Nabis, the sit down comic. How you all doing tonight? You know, sometimes I practice law. A lot of people ask me do I practice entertainment law. I tell them, some folks actually find me entertaining. people see me dressed like this, and when I tell 'em I'm a lawyer, they say, "Are you still practicing?" And I say, "You know, one day "I'm get it perfect and retire." You know, this is how you get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice. So I was at a party the other night, and the woman who was the host says to me, "You know, we really enjoyed your company the other night." And I said, "Well, how could you do that? "I haven't formed it yet." There's a reason they call me the sit down comic. Because every time I try and tell a joke, people say, "Sit down, sit down." You know, in addition to entertainment law, there's an area of law called intellectual property, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets. We call it IP. And I'm at a party the other night, a reception, and I'm talking to this woman lawyer, and I say to her, "Well, what kind of law do you practice?" And she said, "Soft IP." I said, "Oh, oh, soft IP, that's great. "If you get hit in the head with soft IP, you're okay." Everyone stays away from the hard IP. Let me tell ya. You get hit in the head with hard IP, the concussion protocol is killer. They take you out of the game right away. They sit you down in front of judges and doctors, and they make you answer these funny questions. And you're out of the game. Sit down. Bingo, we got a winner, ladies and gentlemen. Sir, can I interest you in a run for Congress? No, no, you're not interested? Keeping your options open, are you? Well, speaking of politics, there've been a lot of protests lately. And a lot of people say protesting doesn't work, but you know, I remember the days when George Bush was president. You all remember that, right? Right, so there were a lot of protests then too, and I remember the chants. No more Bush! No more Bush! No more Bush! No more Bush! And I gotta tell you, I think it worked. Have you seen the internet lately? I can't find bush anywhere. All right, folks. Thank you. I see my time's up. You've been great. I must know your name. Why? Because you're the prettiest woman I've seen in a really long time. Bull. But the the march of time begs the voice and utterance of my tongue. In this fleeting grasp of a moment, let me not forever ask, "What if I had just asked her name?" I'm America. Really? Charlie. What were your parents smoking when they named you? They were very proud and happy to be here in America. Can I entice you for a beverage? It's true, I will die, but for the lack of thy love by the heavens, no. Shakespeare, really? You're quoting Shakespeare? Come, you're a muse of fire. Let us ascend to the heavens. Does this ever work? I don't know, that was the first time I've tried it. How am I doing? Sit down. Touche. Well played, well played. Coffee. So let it be written, so let it be done. America, she was a surprise. I made my move. The game had begun. Now the dharma wheels turn. Planets align. Be patient, the dawn is coming. Hey, it's Charlie, the sit down comic. How are you? I'm better now. Your film made me cry. Well then, I guess I did my job. Hello? I'm here, Charlie. Oh, I thought I lost you. No, you haven't lost me. Charlie, I need you right now. Do you want me to come over? - Yes. - Half an hour? Perfect. I'll text you the address. See you soon. I need to sit. Are you okay? Uh-huh. I bet I can make your face tingle without ever touching you. Bull. No, I'm serious. Just relax. Close your eyes. Okay, but no funny stuff, okay. - I'm serious. - Okay, okay. And no matter what you hear, just relax. How did you do that? It's magic. The moment my helmet light hit you, you slayed me with your smile. You just wanted to get laid. Come on. Sorry. I just wanted to be loved and touched and desired. And you're charming when the light hits you just right. And then there's your magical fingers. This will prove to be a great time in the lives of all Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! This will prove to be a great time in the lives of all Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! This will prove to be a great time in the lives of all Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! This will prove to be a great time in the lives of all Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! Charlie! Dear Mr. Conover. My name is Charlie Nabis, I am a filmmaker. As a means of introduction you might be interested to know that I have been shot at twice, have traveled to Mt. Fuji in Japan on a Buddhist pilgrimage, and when I was 14, I was very sick. I stood almost six feet tall but weighed only 69 pounds. I was given a few hours to live. While this has some bearing on the reason for this letter, it also gives you a window to my soul. It's why I make movies. I believe you have an interesting story to tell. I'd like to be the one to tell it. Can we meet? Sincerely, Charlie. Holy crap. How'd I miss that? Holy shit. Holy shit. Mr. Conover? Whoa, thanks for agreeing to meet with me. You are an interesting man, Mr. Nabis. I like to meet interesting people. Once upon a time, I used to collect them. No more? Firing away from the get-go I see. Just curious. Ah, that crazy little thing that kills cats, huh? Why'd you have me come in the back way? Privacy, security. And of course, as a test. Did I pass the test? We're still talking, aren't we? Any more tests headed my way? Will they be open book, multiple guess? Possibly. I mean, we're all tested, aren't we? How so? Oh, come on now, Charlie. I mean, I can call you Charlie, yes? Sure, can I call you John? Sure. Jack if you wind up liking me. You know the test that every living being faces, the struggle to survive, to thrive, advance, overcome, manage, pacify, motivate. The stuff of your movies and books. You've seen my films? You think it was that cute little letter from Boris that put you in front of me? That was part of it, but the reason I wanted to meet you was America. I'm not sure I understand. You don't understand? No. No, what's my personal life got to do with you? America's wellbeing is of concern to me. I've taken it upon myself to keep a watchful eye on her. She's a grown woman. Do you really think the sugar daddy routine's gonna work with her? Now you're being insolent. I am no one's fool, Mr. Nabis. The proximity of your tryst with America and that sycophantic joke of a letter you sent is not lost on me. You're just using her. Well, my plan worked, didn't it? I mean, here I am talking to the ghost, the myth that is John T. Conover, the man gone 10 years without a confirmed public sighting, aren't I? I didn't expect to be thunderstruck. She swept me off my feet. I wouldn't hurt her. Does she know this? Look, she means something to me. I don't know how it's gonna go. But right now, she's more important to me than this gig. So I tell you what. Why don't we just pretend this meeting never happened? I'll tell Boris it was all a ruse, and that will be that. You hear that? That is the sound of money. Relentless, unrepentant, unfeeling, constant. Oh, the march of time has you thinking, doesn't it? I have begun to question the capitalist system on some of the choices that I've made. The chimes at midnight. Possibly. You know, my film would allow you to protect the way the world sees you and your legacy. It would be in your own words. Life is a dream, but movies are forever. I have nothing more to say to you today. Are we square, Jack? Great, I'll see myself out. It's closed. Yeah, apparently. Oh. It's not a big deal. We can eat somewhere else. It was a favorite of mine. Their crab cakes. America? It's okay, I'm not really that hungry. I could eat. Let's just go for a walk, okay? Sure. - Hi. - Hi. You met with Conover? Sorry, I should have told you. It's no skin off my ass. That man keeps trying to insert himself in my life. Still I should have told you. Things happened pretty quick for us, didn't they? His guilt runs deep. I used it for a while. Then it got sticky. So I moved on. He has not. Your uncle? Mm-hmm. Quite the character you are. Maybe it was too easy. They say when you're in harmony with the universe, your fortune chases you. It was all going my way. Come on, I gotcha, don't worry. Charlie? Surprise, tango anyone? Are you kidding me? Let's dance. Whoa, America? America. America? Come on baby, wake up, wake up. Yeah, I have an emergency. My girlfriend just fainted. I'm at Washington and Boise in Culver City. I don't know, she just fainted. I need an ambulance. Come on, baby. Come on, wake up. Wake up. Come on, wake up baby, wake up. Come on, the ambulance is coming. You can hear it now. Ambulance is here. Yeah, Dr. Cole gets out at 11:00 a.m. Mr. Nabis? Hi, I'm Dr. Amira. You brought her in? Is she okay? She's awake. Her cognitive functions don't seem to be impaired. Well, what happened? She was dehydrated and had low blood sugar. That's not uncommon for a person with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma? You didn't know, oh. I shouldn't have spoken. Off the record? Where she is now, the chemo is not working. She needs a bone marrow transplant. Well, I don't know who her family is or where they are. We just started on our journey. It doesn't matter. As long as it's a match, it could be anyone, even you. You wanna get me tested? She doesn't have much longer. If you're a match, that's greater love. Well, can I see her? Visiting hours are over. So you won't have long with her. But I'll make sure you get in, okay? Thanks, doc. Hey, Amber Waves. Charlie. I'm sorry. Oh, come on now. Love means never having to say you're sorry. You're horrible. I know, but I couldn't resist. That restaurant, that was special for you, wasn't it? I should have told you. You just scared me, that's all. I'm actually gonna see if I'm a match. Charlie, you don't have to. Well, it's worth a shot. Yeah? Yeah. I will soothe you and heal you, I will bring you roses. For I too have been covered with thorns. You are away from me. There's a window open from my heart to yours. From this window, like the moon I keep sending news secretly. O' There is one kiss we want with our whole lives, the touch of the spirit on the body. Your journey is the journey of love, sense it to the depth and say no more. Because of love, I have become the giver of light. You are so sweet to meet me for drinks. Well, your invitation was a surprise to be sure. What's it like to work for Boris Levashov? Are you excited about interviewing Conover? It hasn't happened yet. It will. Anyway, I like talking to you. You didn't answer my question. Which one was that? What's it like to work for Boris Levashov? I get to meet a lot of famous people and interesting people like you. I'm guessing you know where a lot of bodies are buried then, huh? Why Mr. Nabis, whatever do you mean? I shouldn't tell you this, but I'm the one who put your video in front of Boris. Oh, well thank you for that. Please, Boris, only watches porn on his own. The man has no taste. Well, he doesn't really need taste for his line of work, does he? Someday very soon, I'm going to set up my own PR firm. - Good for you. - Yeah. I want you to be my client. Hey Boris, this is Charlie. Yeah, It's on today. On a boat in the Marina. One second, I'm all tangled here. Okay, how's that, all right? - Yeah. - Testing one, two. Do you hear? Let me know if this light is too much. Yeah, I guess that'll be fine. Shall we? John, you haven't been seen in public for almost 15 years. Where have you been? Out there. Why all the mystery? There's no mystery. I just didn't wanna be in public life anymore. Was there a specific event or incident that caused that to happen? Let me put it this way. Every time I went anywhere, people always had their hand out. Politicians, foundations, charities, meals, events. They all wanted a piece of me. And that just wasn't fun anymore. You were able to just walk away. Absolutely. I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams with Wise Water. Did your time at sea change your mind at all? Let me try to paint you a picture. Imagine it's midnight. There's a full moon with only a few clouds in the sky. And you're at the helm. Your watch. And you look out into that darkness that goes on forever. On a night like this, you can see the silver surface of the ocean, the rock and roll of the sea dances with you. You look up at the sky at the stars, and they're brilliant and pristine. You feel like you're one with the universe. It's like a satori experience. You are the world. And then you realize you're alone. That if you got sick or hurt, there was no one to call. And you are humbled, fearful, and exalted, because you're in the presence of guess what, Charlie? What? Thou nature art my goddess. Brother, that's a force to be reckoned with. Kind and gentle, and then in an instant, furious and vengeful. Why would I wanna be anywhere else? Why indeed? You know, there are some folks that wanna be rich and famous. I just want there to be rich and anonymous. Do you miss the game? There are characters that, there are characters around that have more money than they can ever spend, and they wanna keep playing. You know, raping and pillaging is a way of life to them. The thrill of winning big. It's addictive to some. Not to me. They add nothing to humanity. Is that important to you? It wasn't when I was young. See, to some extent, I just wanted my piece of the pie. Well, I look at the world now, and there are problems that can be solved. And we have the money to solve them. And we can even get wealthy solving them, see. This thing called greed, this driving force of capitalism that sucks people in, you see, they forget. It kills any chance. It's ugly out there. And if we don't solve it, it's gonna get even uglier. Revolution? Perhaps. What would that solve? Everything, nothing. Is that why you're doing this interview? In part. What's the other part? You tell me. Come on, Jack. You wasting my time? That's not my intent, believe me. Tell me about Adam Afrides. What would you like to know? How did he die? I see we're going into all corners of my life. Yes, you knew that when we started. Did you set him up? Excuse me? The Wall Street Journal reported that you tried to buy him out, you were partners. We just started going in different directions, that's all. He fought you, you wouldn't sell. When that happened, what did you do? I'm not understanding your question. All of a sudden, he's found unconscious, naked, with an underage girl in a cheap motel room in Calabasas. He's arrested on statutory rape charges. That was a very sad turn of events. You had nothing to do with that? What should you say? He was gay. I was as shocked as anyone, okay. He sold you his shares then, didn't he? We reached an agreement, yes. Tell me about your son. He was troubled. He agreed to wear a wire. The Kern County District Attorney was investigating the Planning Commissioners for corruption. You worked very closely with Rex Hernandez, the head commissioner. I did. In fact, you donated over $250,000 in campaign contributions to his and his associates. You... Look, I don't know the exact number, but you have to protect your interests, don't you? Oh, I understand. Rex Hernandez is in jail now. And the district attorney, he wanted you there as well. Possibly. But as you can see, I am not in jail. Your son was ratting on you. Drugs put him in the position of vulnerability. Okay no, there was no ratting out. My son was sick. He was troubled, as I said. On November 6th, 2004, he took a shotgun and committed suicide at his Las Vegas home. His funeral was the last time you were seen in public. Do you know why I'm having the success that I am, Charlie? Because even though I wanted my piece of the pie, I also knew that whatever I did I had to be of service to humanity. My time in the peace corps showed me that. Politicians had us all believing that we were the great white American hope come to teach the world's poor. No. The truth was I learned more from the people I was trying to help than they ever learned from me. What about your company's water rights, the new find in the central valley? Bingo! Now you're talking, Charlie. Are you selling to the Russians? Hell no. Come on, that's a lot of bullshit. Then what will happen to the water? Okay, well you see, there you go, Charlie. It's the reason why I'm here. And not out there. Because I want, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to set up a trust to hold the water rights, so that the farmers can use them when they need it. The rights can never be used privately or for profit. Wow. Isn't that where you bottle your product? We purchase water rights over the years and have plants all over the world. So not so much anymore. What about your board, your shareholders? Since I'm the majority shareholder, I don't think it's gonna be a problem. That's very noble of you. It looks that way, doesn't it? I'm just here to give back. That's what being out there taught me. You do understand this is all very confidential? But what about my film? It'll all be worked out and announced before you're finished editing. I don't really have a choice, do I? No, you don't. What do you say we adjourn for today? I knew you were the right man for the job. Hey Boris, it's Charlie. I just shot John T. Conover, my first interview with him. Wow. All right, we're gonna do another one. I'll let you know when. No! No, you son of a bitch! Yes, yes, I understand. I thought you told me it wouldn't be a big deal to find a donor. Okay. Okay. America. Charlie? They can't find a donor for me. Okay, okay. Don't panic. I'm gonna go get tested today, see if I'm a match. We'll find a way, Amber Waves. Okay. Can I get you anything? Get me a donor match. I don't know what to say. I don't know. I'm afraid. Me too. Let me get tested. Stay positive, yes? Yes. Go for Charlie. Mr. Nabis, I have Mr. Levashov for you. Please hold. Charlie, you motherfucker. You said you would call as soon as you were done. What the fuck are you talking about? I left you a voicemail message. Didn't you get it? Do not curse at me. Don't you call me a motherfucker, the first words out of your mouth. You work for me! Listen Boris, I don't have the time for your shit right now. My girlfriend's dying. No joke, she's dying. I have to get tested to see if I'm a donor match. I need to see the footage that you shot. Did you not hear what I just said? My girlfriend is dying, you fuck. Boris? Mr. Nabis, I have Mr. Levashov for you. - Please hold. - Hello. Look, I'm on my way to the oncologist's office right now. Are you gonna be civil? Look, I am sorry to hear about your girlfriend. When you get time, I need to see the footage that you shot. It's very important. Okay, okay, I promise. I'll get it to you as soon as I can. Stay tuned. What the? - Doc? - It's important. You're a match. That is good news, but you coulda just sent me an email or called me. Also, I want you to know the risks involved in being a donor. There are risks? What are they? We'd start with a series of injections to boost your stem cell count. There is a wrinkle and a caution in your case. What's that? We'd have to use anesthesia. With your elevated blood pressure, there's a possibility of heart attack or stroke. Oh, that's not so good. I gotta think about this. If your answer is yes, it would be better to start the prep right away. Well, can I do the prep and then cancel on the donation? Yes, we're running out of time. Okay, okay, let's do it. But I gotta warn you, doc, I really hate needles, and sometimes I get a bit clammy. So. I don't feel so good. I'm gonna sit down. You'll be fine. You want me to sit with you for awhile? I'll live, doc. Don't worry. Amber Waves. Charlie, are you okay? Dr. Amira said you had a reaction to the prep. Yeah, yeah, I'm all right. I'm gonna be fine, don't worry. I'll live. It's kinda funny that I'm your only match. I know. How are you holding up? Up and down. I have better moments than others. Are you eating? I could cook for you. You can cook too. When the moon is full and the mist is on the moor, who knows what dreams may come. Come, cook for me. Actually, I have a surprise for you. What's the surprise? You know that restaurant that was closed? Well, I found the chef and I had him make your favorite crab cakes just special for you. What the hell is in there? Oh yeah. Tomato. Can't have a dinner without tomato. A-ha! Bravo. Charlie? Charlie. Charlie. Your phone is going crazy. What? John Conover is dead. I'm sorry. This means my interview with him is really important. Is it okay if I leave you? Yes, of course. Charlie? Dr. Amira says you need another injection today. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Oh fuck. No! And I just came home and my camera and my computers are gone. I've been burglarized, yes. It happened last night sometime. I wasn't home. All right. Would it be quicker if I just came down to the station and made a report? Yeah, I'll bring my receipts, yes. Let me speak to Boris. No, no, just tell him, "Charlie Nabis called, "and it's important." Not now, Dr. Amira, not now. Yes, hello? Yeah doc, I know I was supposed to come in today for another shot. How late can I get there? All right, I'll be there, I promise. Okay, bye-bye. Hey doc. Charlie? America's in the emergency room again. So I just got here. I need you to get here now. Hey. Horses eat that, you know. You've been hanging around me too much. Good, you're here. We're gonna have to move the procedure up if we want the donation to have any chance at all. Are my numbers up? Whatever they are, we have to go with them. Oh. I'm trying to book the procedure, but the fucking insurance company is not approving it. America's life is at risk. Yeah, I'm working on it. Do they understand that? I'm gonna have to twist some arms. Are you telling me the insurance company is gonna kill America? I'll have to let you know when I can book an OR. Don't worry, we'll get it sorted out. Okay. Visiting hours are over. They're gonna kick me out of here. I'll be back in the morning. Google, what is 34.071 - 118.0451? Oh. Google, where is 35.071 - 118.064? A-ha. What's with all the spycraft? Shh. All right, the longitude and latitude bit, that was really clever. It took me awhile to figure it out. Your second installment for your services. You could've mailed it to me. There may not be enough time for that. Conover's dead. What the hell is going on? Would you hush? I know about Conover. I mean, I've been putting calls into Boris. I thought he'd be furious. So did I, but he's not. He told me to give you that and say thank you. I'm done? The job is complete. That doesn't make any sense. When the news broke, Boris had a bunch of calls on an encrypted sat phone, all speaking in Russian. What's with the spycraft? It's what Boris told me to do. Well, where the hell is he? I need to speak to him. I don't know. He's been partying like an oligarch, just drugs, girls, clubs. Vegas, Cyprus, I don't know where he is. Son of a bitch. He used me to get to Conover. He also asked me to give you this. A photo of America's house. That message is clear. Fuck. You should know, he was very specific about when and how I was to give you that check and that envelope. Be careful. When you're driving home tonight, if you think you're being followed, you make three left turns in a row. If the car follows you, you go right to the police station. Understand? Yeah. I understand. When I woke, you were gone. Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to meet someone about our mutual friend. How are you feeling? Okay. When you weren't there I was worried. I'm coming over in a little bit. Do you want me to bring you anything? Just your sense of humor. Roger that. Ciao. Well, they didn't waste any time, did they? Yeah, can I speak to Natalie? Do you know when she'll be in? What? When did this happen? I said it more than once. There's only three types of critters in this world, sharks, vampires, and victims. You always try to be the shark, just eat what you need, but sometimes, sometimes you end up being all three at the same time. Even still, there's karma. In time the wheels will turn. I wanted them to pay. I wanted justice for Conover and Natalie, but there was a sword over my head, America. Oh, thank God. Hi, Charlie. It's Dr. Amira. The insurance approval finally came in. I booked an OR for tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. I need you to call and confirm asap. No food or drink for the next 12 hours. That's very important. Okay, let me know that you got this. And it's okay to take your BP meds with a sip of water. Tomorrow is your big day. Yep. You okay? Yeah, I just don't like needles. That's all. Thank you. Holy shit, Boris! What the fuck is he doing here? All right, all right. Yeah? Where the hell are you? Listen to me, I have a narrow window of time here. You get your ass here now! I'll be there, I promise. What the hell was I thinking chasing Russians in the middle of Los Angeles when my love was waiting for my aid? I know what you're thinking. You need to hear some kind of plea for absolution or an explanation for my complicity. Some zen saying like, "If you understand, "the world is the way it is." The truth. The truth is that I'm scared. They're about to put me to sleep, and I'm not sure I'm gonna wake up. I did what I could is what I would say. Maybe I made a difference. Oh America, I hope I can save you. Okay, Charlie. Here we go.
