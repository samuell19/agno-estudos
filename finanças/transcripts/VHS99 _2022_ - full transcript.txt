Gentlemen, when I look at this battlefield, I see some of the bravest men ever to wear a uniform. Is that you, Johnson? You're a real lazy piece of shit. Johnson, wake up! Sorry, sir. Just guarding the tank. You were sleeping. I heard you. But it's just so comfortable up here. I, huh... Goddammit. And you there, stop posing. - Sorry, sir. - Sorry, sir. Fucking showboats. Excuse me, dear capitan. What do you want? Can I get some cigarettes? - No. - How about a rifle? You're a prisoner of war. That doesn't mean we can still be friends. - It does actually. - Does it really? I've never heard that. How about a bugle? We already have a guy who plays the bugle. I can for sure play better than him. It's true. I suck. I'm not giving you a bugle. If I had it my way I would kill all Germans in this place. But you already killed all the Germans in this place. I'd do it again in a heartbeat, so do not test me. Ouch. It's pretty mean to threaten someone with a war crime, my friend. We aren't fri... Sir, I see something over there. What is it was? Where's Johnson? Yeehaw. Johnson, you yahoo! Everybody run! This is the "Video Journal of Neurosurgery" with... Guys, I told you the list is endless. So, why wait?

Don't use that word, dumb-ass. What is wrong with you? We're visiting the Colony. The infamous Colony Underground. Why do you got to keep acting so fruity lately? What's it you, Mohammed? Any who, for those of you born yesterday, The Colony Underground was this really wicked... It was an art collective. "It was an arts art collective?" So, this art collective had like hell a shows all the time. It was all ages, and some pretty big bands would come from the city, like the KGB, Eddie Cash and the Star Fuckers, Valentine Fox, mostly pumping hardcore stuff. - Yeah. We totally would have played there. - Yeah. - For sure. - For real. - We would have if it weren't for the freak electrical fire that broke out three years ago to the day. - Wait, seriously? - Yeah, March 6, 1996. It's March 5th. Can you let him talk? God! Three years ago, a freak electrical fire barbecued the inside of The Colony Underground and claimed four innocent lives. The lives of the very band that headlined that night. Legend has it their bodies only burned after being trampled to death by their own fans. Fans so desperate to escape the towering flames they crushed their heroes under foot without a second thought. Dude, keep going. Hmm? Oh, yeah, yeah look how freaked out Ankur looks. Shut up, I'm fine. Oh, your left pocket. Is Ankur a little bitch? Let's see, let's see. Yo, it is turning! It is turning. Swear to God, look, look, look! Okay, okay, okay. So, that band was Bitch Cat. You can cut in stuff from the tape you have right there? - Yeah. - That'd be a cool transition. What tape? Oh, dude it's so sick. At church.

And we're going to suck though because we've been rehearsing, what, two months? Yeah, show out to your Nazi dictator dad. I hope that's... - Oh my God, whatever. No, wait come on. Like, what else though? What else? - I don't know. We're going to get the gear, if there's any that works. Yeah, but why'd you make a stop here? Your house? - Come on, K. - Hey, no. I just think inquiring minds want to know if you're really just scared little pussy bitch. That's all I want to know! Come on! Hey, I'm sorry. I meant to say a little scaredy baby who thinks he's going to meet some ghosts. Yo, Rachel, get the camera. Get the fucking camera, Rachel. Why's Ankur being a little bitch right now? Stop. Do you want your mommy because you don't come home. Get off me! Oh, no! The lady ghosts are going to eat me. Dude, I can't believe we're here right now. Come on, it's going to be fun. Come on, let's just go. Rach, those chicks seem kind nice. I just don't think we should fuck with their grave site. But, like, you have to say why. Come on, it'll make a better video. I think it's cool. Okay, fine. So, you know these stories, okay? Hindu stories about bhuts. - Bhuts? - Yeah, dead people. Restless spirits with unfinished business, and supposedly if you bother them they'll like, they just like... They'll what? They'll fucking possess you, okay? - Yes! - We're in. So, that's why you went home and got a baggie of spices? They're like ghost killing spices. Dude, just stop, I don't want... Relax, spice boy. Get off my dick, motherfucker. Wow, calm your fucking tits, dude. Yo, hey, wait up. Welcome to what's left of The Colony Underground. Like, literally so far underground. Yeah, like six feet under. It's insane the whole audience actually got out of here alive. Yeah, well, they sacrifice the band to do it. Imagine dying in a stampede. Herd mentality, dude. Sheep. Still smells like a fire in here. Crispy bodies. Whoa. What? Rach, I don't... Dude, come on. just go. Come on. Hurry up. Boo! This place is a total maze. So many hallways.

Look at this here. Why would anybody want to live here? Well, I mean, for a homeless guy, it's not that bad. - Yeah, I bet. - Look at all the... I bet we're not alone. Dude, seriously. It's just us here. I know it is. - That's some crackhead, heroin-licking homeless guy here. Can you please stop? Sorry. What are you doing? Stop. Don't go in there. - Come on. - Whooo.

There you are. Hello. Hey. Um, I just... Okay. Hi. I just had to record this video after going to Beta Sigma Eta today and meeting all the girls. No, that's bad. That's bad. Okay. Okay. I just want you to know that from the moment that I walked into Beta Sigma Eta I knew that it was my home. I want you girls to be my friends for life, and I'm not going to apply to any more sororities. I knew from the moment that I met you that we will become soul sisters. - A suicide bid? - Helen? I thought you were studying at the library. You're only putting one sorority on your application. A suicide bid. - Yeah, I know what a suicide bid is, Helen. I'm not stupid. So, what? Well, so, if they say no, you will be excluded from the whole sorority process. And that means spending your entire freshman year as an outcast. You really want to take that risk with those girls? What do you mean, those girls? I mean, you saw the way they looked at us when they showed us around? You mean you really think they'll say yes to people like us? No, not us. Do you have a cigarette? I can't do this. Jesus Christ, Annie. You're going to bring security over here. What took you guys so long? Don't get your panties in a twist. We had to get some supplies. - Oh, my God. Turns out Lily here really likes to party. Oh, we are going to party. You guys, you got it? You got the keys? My dad will kill me if he finds out. Yeah, but do you have the keys? You know I do. Come on, let's go! Come on, it's time. Hey, Lindsay. - Oh, shit. - Oh my God. We're going to have a fun night. - Oh, my gosh. - Tote college. Isn't she the cutest? Welcome! Oh, my gosh, this place is incredible. Pretty cool, huh? Oh, man, we loved your message. It was so heartfelt. Wasn't it girls? - So cute. - Adorable. We were so flattered that you would suicide bid just to join our sorority. Yeah, friends forever. Yes, soul sisters. - Soul sisters! - Soul sisters! So, what are we doing here? Have you ever heard of The Legend of Guiltine? Guiltine, was a pretty young freshman who went here to TCU maybe 20 years ago. She wanted to join a sorority, our sorority just like you. And she was desperate and alone, just like you. And the girls took her back here and into the graveyard. And they told her that in order to be a part of their sorority, she had to spend the night buried in a coffin. Only they didn't just leave her there for a night. They left her there for an entire week. And when they finally dug her up... There was no one in it. What happened to her? No one knows. Some say she just crawled right through into the underworld. And if you listen closely, sometimes you can hear a knocking sound. It's Guiltine, desperate and alone. Looking for someone awake who she can take back into the underworld to play with. Drink up! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! We have something for you. Surprise, bitch. No way! We want you to join our family. Right, girls? We just need you to do one thing first. Thank you. Okay. One tiny thing. We need you to spend the night in a coffin. Just like Guiltine. Come on! You're going to have fun, I promise. Okay. You're going to be scared shit less. Oh. Um, Annie, I don't know if I'm actually want to do this. Oh, come on, Lily. We all had to do it. You... you all did this? Sure. It really isn't that bad. I promise. - Okay. There's enough air in a coffin to last you 24 hours. The faster you breathe, the faster you use up your air so you can't panic. You can pull this cord at any time, and it'll ring the bell. And we'll come and dig you up. But if you do, you'll have forfeited your place in our sorority. Here you go. We want to see how scared you get. And so, you can see down there. Just be brave. It really isn't that bad. Annie probably won't let you stay on there all night. Take this. Only open it when you're most scared and about to pull the cord. It'll give you strength. I promise you. Thank you. Watch out for Guiltine. If you hear her knock, whatever you do, don't let her know you're down there. If you let her know you're alive, she will take you back to the world of the dead to play with. She's just fucking with you. B-S-E, B-S-E, B-S-E, B-S-E! Good luck down there. Don't get too scared. Oh, it's nice and cozy. Any last words? Alright. Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Whoo! Oh, earth, earth. Oh, moist earth. You took away my father and my dear mother. You took away my father and my dear mother, then take me also for I am very lonely. Nighty-night. It's okay. It's okay, just don't panic. Don't panic. [Exhales sharply It's okay. It's all just for show. They're not going to leave you down here. Come on, you knew they were going to do this. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. Oh, Helen, if you could see me now. What did you do this weekend? Library? Oh, that's cool. Me? Oh, you know, the usual, just buried alive in a coffin. No, that's what you want, isn't it? You want me to fail so I can end up like you. Sad and alone every Friday night wishing a boy, any boy would ask you out. But I'm not like you. I'm like them. It's okay. It's all going to be okay. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? She's probably so scared. The box, the box. What the fuck? Aw, poor baby. Poor Lily. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Oh, my God. She's definitely shit herself. - Let me out! - Let me out! Let me out! Get the bell. If they find out we're doing a hazing prank, we'll all get expelled. Fuck! My dad will kill me! No one's getting expelled. We'll hide and we'll come back later. But what about Lily? I said we'll come back later. Let's go. Hey, dispatch for 1061 at the cemetery, do respond with an update. Fuck this. Let's get back inside before we catch pneumonia. Help! I need help! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Please! Please, somebody! Helen, if you ever see this, I just want you to know that I'm really sorry. I was such an idiot. You're my best friend. You're my only true friend. I don't know why I thought I could fit in with those girls. I don't know why I even I wanted to. Oh, my God. No! No! No! No! Let me out! Let me out! No! Help me! Let me out! Oh, my God! No! No! No! Please! No! Please help me! Please help! No! Help! Oh, my God! Annie? Annie, let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Oh, my God! I'm going to be fucking sick. Are you fucking filming right now? We have to get her. It's too late. Imogen, no. It's empty. What are you talking about? The coffin is empty. Lily isn't inside. That's not possible. - What if Guiltine took her? - Don't be stupid. Guiltine's just a story. We were never here, okay? We never speak of this again. Understand? Hello? Hello?! Hello, Annie. I made a deal with Guiltine that if she let me go, I'd give her as many sisters as she could possibly want. Her own sorority... soul sisters. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let... me... out! Oh, my God! Anderson, are you alive? Tell it to me straight, Sarge. Am I going to die? Uh, no, no. You're... going to be fine. My legs. I can't feel my legs. Why can I feel my legs? Y-You're in shock. Everything will be alright. It's all getting dark. So, so dark. Ah, dammit, he's dead. I really thought he was going to make it. Alright, no one else get bitten in half by the rat monster. ♪ Oi ♪ ♪ Yeah, boy ♪ Welcome, welcome.

Hmm? Now, not many people make it. In fact, nobody has, Donna. But I got a feeling. Oh, yeah, I got a feeling. And that feeling starts down in my feet. And it goes higher and higher, and it rises higher and higher. Does anybody else have that? Oh, yes. Oh, can you feel it Donna? Now tell me. What makes you think you are better than all the boys and girls that came before you? Well, my family says that I can do anything I put my mind to. I know I can. Right. Sure. We'll see about that. I like this one. Okay, well, Donna, let's just say that fate does smile upon you and by some absurd miracle you make it all the way... What are you going to wish for? I'm going to wish for... Any hidden talents out there I should know about? And welcome back to "Ozzy's Dungeon." I'm here with the two remaining contestants. We have Donna from the big D, Detroit, Michigan, and Timmy from the City of Angels, Los Angeles, California. Okay, so who's ready for the final challenge? Okay, kids, we are going to start by making our way through Ozzy's orifices and make our way back to find a hidden flag in the cracked rock. Then up the ladder we go and through the mouth hole and down the throat ended in this yucky, mucky mix stomach. And then through the green jello, we're going to search and we're going to find ourselves a red flag. And with that red flag, we're going to crawl on our hands and knees through the large intestine and then out through the poop chute escape route. Eww! Now, if you beat the clock, and you get me that red flag before the time runs out, you will be the first contestant to ever to make it to the dungeon, meet Ozzy and have that favorite wish... granted. Yay! Okay, now before anything, let us have one minute on the clock, please. Wait, kids, wait. Wait for my go. On your marks... get set... Go! Through the orifices. And they're off through the... Oh! Timmy, what a horrible start to the game. Let's go. That's a terrible start. Now go catch or get that flag. Let's get going. Oh, Donna's already gotten that red flag and has made her way up the ladder. Let's go, baby! And here she comes down the throat. Alright, let's dig around for that red flag. Oh, Timmy's closing the gap. Oh, adventurous. Very good, Timmy. You actually made it. Alright folks, we don't want to get the suit messy. Did we find... Oh, God, you got the flag. Into the intestine you go. Timmy is not very good at all. One of these... There he goes. Oh, Timmy almost stood up there for a second. Okay, let's see who's going to make it outside of this nice big, long pink hole first. Who is going to make it out of the long and winding intestine first? Oh, there she is. It's Donna coming out... Ooh, someone's got a boo-boo. No! No, Donna! Donna! No, let me go! I'mma get Timmy! You can't do this! Oh, Jesus. We might need a band-aid. Oh, for sakes. Don't get that on my shoes. Don't get that.

Then you're going to find a flag. When you find that flag, you're going to come out this way, go through the guts, make your way through all their slip and slide until you get to the exit.

Brady is a goddamn pimp. Hey, shut up, man. Brady, dude, mad respect. Yo, does she have a boyfriend, though? What does she smell like? Does she have the hot girl stink? Who?

Sounds like a date. Yo, I never would have guessed he's got more game than his big bro. Yo, shut the fuck up! I've got an idea. Alright, just level me. Is it possible? Yeah, I could install a spyware program, but if I get caught, she'll... she'll kill me. Then you'll die hero. Brady, if you do this, you'll be a fucking legend, plus you can hang out with us tonight. Really? He's in, boys. There we go. - Don't look... - Turn around! - Oh, my God. - Fucking Brady. Dude, your brother. Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. Hey. Maybe she's a sculptor.

Dude, we're just having some fun. I know, it's just... She trusted me, man. Just shut it off. We will, we will, in a little while. Hey, Brady, where are you going, man? Oh, fuck it. - The Internet is awesome. Yeah. Eww! Yo, what? She's double jointed? - Gross. - I'd still tap that. Contortionist. A wig. I knew it. I fucking knew it. - Oh! Oh! - What the fuck? Oh, oh. Uh... Yo, wait, wait, wait. Is this that CGI thing? Man, it's still... It's still kind of hot. I do not... I don't like it. I don't like it. Nah. Holy shit. Guys, she sees us. Like, you need to call an ambulance, the police and then your parents. Call your parents. - I got it. 911, what is your emergency? Yeah, I'm calling about a girl with snakes in her head. - How many snakes, sir? - I don't know how many snakes! Holy shit. Yo, yo. Did you hear that? What was that? Yo, yo, yo. She's on the roof, dude. - What the fuck? - Oh! Oh! Oh no. Oh, my God! Get the fuck out of here. - What's going on? - Watch out! Go, go, go, go, go! Look, we need to get out, We need to get out of here. Brady. S-Sandra? We... we didn't mean to hurt you, right? Right, Dylan? We... Oh, my G... No! Nobody can kill him! Leave him alone! No! - Jane McAllister, 48... - Sorry, hold up your release. Jane McAllister, 48. Got it. This is where the vessel will lie during the ritual. Are you nervous at all? No, I'm not part of the coven. I'm just the husband in the background. But, yeah, I'm nervous. Hey. Did you eat something before we left? Yeah, I grabbed one of your Gogurts. That's not a meal, man. I ate two of them. So, tell us why you volunteered to be the vessel, and start off by saying I volunteered to be the vessel because. Um, I volunteered to be the vessel because I've always felt like I was destined for something bigger than me, I guess. Does that make sense? And I just want to say, it is an absolute honor to offer my body as the earthly vessel of Our Lord Ukabon. Thank you so much, Kirsten. Good luck tonight. Yeah, good luck or... yeah. You guys nervous to see one? A demon? You guys are in for a trip. Have you seen one? Wait, I thought it'd be like New Year's Eve, Y2K for the whole thing to... I mean, like, for big ones, yeah. Julia, the book. - Got to go. - Okay. It's important to massage the doorway to the other realm, but we won't call Ukabon into the vessel until the stroke of midnight when the veil is at its very thinnest. Thank you. - The window... - Window. - Begins to crack. - Crack. - The gate... - Gate- - begins to open. - Open. - The veil... - Veil - begins to slip. - Slip. - Ukabon. - Ukabon. - Ukabon. - Ukabon. We thread the needle with thy name and pull thee to our earthly plane. Troy. Faces. What was that. - What? - Hey. - What? I think I saw something. Something's here! Is that Fergus again? Just cast him out, honey. - Okay, follow my lead. - Don't stop. - We speak to thee uninvited. - Troy, get in there. Uninvited. Our anger thou hast ignited. Ignited. All thy power we... No, no, no. And do cast thee back... May? May, I can't see. May? May?! What? May? Dude, how do we get outside? Oh, dude, your head. Woah, stop, look out. Oh, shit. - What the hell? - What is that? Hey, what's happening? Dude, what is that? - Is that a person? Hey! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! Oh, shit! What was it? What was it? Shh, shh! Turn the light off! Turn it off! Where's the button? Shh, be quiet! Something licked my hand. - What? - Something licked my hand. - Nothing licked your hand. - No, I'm serious. Shut up. I do not care. Shut up. Do not turn on the light. Oh, what? Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God. Shh, shh, shh, shh! We're in Hell. I shouldn't be in Hell! Stop panicking! I shouldn't be here. I go to church. Listen to me, there's no such thing as Hell. Okay? And you don't even go to church. - Help! Stay down. - Hey! - Oh, shit! It saw me. - Troy, shut up. - Oh, shit. What are you doing? It's coming. What do we do, Nate? Wait! Ma'am, wait! Wait! My friend and I are lost. We don't know where we are. Thou art in the feeding grounds. What's the feeding grounds? The... Oh, thou art fresh. What great sin does thou commit? I told you! Look, Miss, me and my friend didn't do anything wrong. Oh, of course not. No, we really didn't. I don't think we died. We were doing this ritual with an old book, and everything went wrong. Book? What book? Troy, I think when those witches sent that demon thing down here, we accidentally came with it. Is that possible? These witches were trying to summon a powerful demon into this woman's body. What name? What name did the try to summon? Shit, I don't remember. Something like... It was like Qui-Gon or Pokémon or some shit. The book upon the Blood Order? Yes! Do you know him? Yes. Oh, I hate Ukabon! Thou art not far from him. Eight minutes. Troy, what we need is this Ukabon by midnight when the witches take him through the vale. Oh, yes! And then we can grab onto him right when they take him through, and we can go home! Yeah. Please, can you take us to Ukabon? We only have eight minutes, shit, seven minutes now. If I return thee to Earth, wilt thou write my name in the Great Book of the Witches? Yeah, sure. My name is Mabel the Skull Biter. I took command of 30 legions. Hurry, run! This way. What are you doing? Keep going. Shh! I almost messed up my hand on these spikes. Get over here. Hey, Mabel, can you go to Hell for an isolated shoplifting incident? Oh, yeah, Troy, that's the worst thing you've ever done. - What's that supposed to mean? - Shut up. No, seriously. What's that supposed to mean? - Shut up! - Shh! Remember, fresh souls taste best. Mabel, slow down. Dude, what if she's taking us to, like, one of her little demon friends or something? No, I don't think so. I'm a pretty good judge of people. Don't... Oh, excuse us. No, don't engage. Hey, keep moving. We're going to lose Mabel. Why are you stopped, bro? Go, go, go! Okay! - Mabel! - Oh, dude. I almost stepped right into that huge trap. - Oh! - Nate, my hand! Where did? Mabel, my hand! Hey! Stop! Why art thou raising thy voice? Maybe because you're leading us to our deaths. Where the hell are you taking us? No one speaketh to me this way. In this world, I giveth the orders! I'm a servant to no one! Great Order, return me at once! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Come back her, you oozing bitch! We're lost. Nate, take the light. Give me a turn with that. What? No. You don't know how to fight. Yes, I do. I took martial arts. - No, you didn't. - When I was a kid I did. Troy, just shut... Ah, shit! Come on! I'm going to stab you in the frigging face with this thing! Oh, shit, Troy! Troy, we're running out of time, man! She just left us here! Maybe you shouldn't have been such a dick! Well, shit, Troy, I'm sorry I'm not buddy-buddy with every demon hell spawn that I meet. It's called leadership, Troy. Somebody has to take charge. It's not going to be you. Well, Mabel and I respond to a different leadership style! Help me! Mabel! Troy, don't! Troy, stop! Mabel. Help me. Oh, help. Uh... Ma'am? Run, Nate! Why do thou scream like cowards? Because there was this woman and then there was... She needed help, but she's... her arms were... Oh, thou met her. They already got me. Shit, man. We only got like four minutes. We're not going to make it. Men, we are here. Hither be the back entrance to the dwelling of Ukabon. Here, where Worm had gone about her business, you must crawl. - Troy, you go first. - No. I only have one good hand. I can't go hold the light. We need the light. I can't hold the light and crawl at the same... I shall fix thy torch to thy head. Wait, what? No. Gross. Nate? Oh, man. Get in the Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Troy, faster! I'm trying, Nate! What is that?! Shh. Quiet, men. Dude, you just pushed me into that creature thing! No, I didn't. It was a reflex. Stop acting like I'm a bad person. Shh! Snatch! 80 seconds. I say we make a beeline to Ukabon at 60. Okay. Nate, you really think I'm a bad person? You cannot be serious right now. Well, excuse me for thinking it's a big deal that my best friend thinks I'm a terrible person. - Shh! - Okay, Nate, just shut me up and ignore me like you always do. You told my ex that I have a gambling addiction. Two years ago. I was just trying to make her feel better. You never have my back, Troy. Shit, 58 seconds. Let's go. Don't forget to write my name in the book! Oh, shit! Almost, Troy. Come on! Nate, look out! Troy, just go! Balls! - Thee, the time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. - The time is nigh. 15 seconds. Wait! Mabel! Come with us! Ukabon. Ukabon. Ukabon. Ukabon. Ukabon. Write my name! Just go, go, go! He's coming! Troy! Troy, we made it! W-wait, why... why am I tied up? Nate, Nate, Nate! - No! - Nate! What are you doing? How did this happen? How did this happen?! - Just try it again. You think we can just do this again, just do it over? Well, we can't! We can't! Another one is in the book, honey. How did you let this happen? Well, the camera crew wasn't my idea. You're going to blame me now? I cleaned for you. I prepare for you. I stop up for you, and this is how you thank me? - Be quiet! - Blame me? You should have listened to me. Shut up. Julia, where are you going?
