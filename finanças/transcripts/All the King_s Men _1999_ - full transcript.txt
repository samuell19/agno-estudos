[ethereal synth music] [thunder rumbles] [dramatic orchestral music] - [gun fires] - [horse whinnies] [horse clopping] [horse snorting] [dramatic orchestral music] [men socialising] [Ted] Section one reporting work finished, Captain Beck, sir. Well done, Sergeant, you've made excellent time. This'll be us falling out for a smoke, then, sir? No, this'll be you now, Sergeant, assisting sections two and three to unload the hay. Fall in. Yes, Captain. The strong assist the weak for the good of the company. [bell dings] [men cheering] [aeroplane rumbles] [engine rumbling] Good morning, Mr. Beck. Good morning, ma'am. Great pleasure to see you, Lady Frances. Please, no ceremony, Mr. Beck. [Frank] Carry on, sergeant. Yes, sir. I stopped simply to welcome you home. You've made fine soldiers from our estate workers, but the men's military training won't suffer from their being called back to Sandringham. No, ma'am, test of their fitness their willingness to work, off the parade ground in Colchester and straight into the fields, best company in training and ready to serve abroad. I trust that everything's in good order on the estate and my brother gave satisfaction in my job. Oh, yes, I have no complaints. My son no doubt will speak to you tonight. Tonight, ma'am? Yes, you dine with us, Mr. Beck, you and Mrs. Beck. She has the invitation, a token of our gratitude. I shall be honoured, ma'am. [horse clopping] [cart rattling] [people socialising] [Soldier] Sir! Mr. Radley, you just missed Lady Frances, sir. No matter, she can wait another hour to behold her fiance, in uniform, if she pleases. [Frank] Congratulations, you volunteered, sir? Shouldn't I call you sir? Surely a captain, even in the Territorials, outranks a mere subaltern? Force of habit, Mr. Radley. You're a guest of the Royal Household. And it's not as if you're under orders, though I'm afraid the men are, so if you're looking for a groom, you'll have to wait until Private Needham is released. My apologies. I'll ride again before dinner. Yes, sir. [Herbert] That's five bob you owe me. [Will] How's that? Five bob, Mr. Beck'd see off the Honourable Asshole. Oh, Radley's not that bad. [Herbert] [scoffs] Oh? Who'll have a cushy war, then? Herbert, why don't you put a turd in your mouth, boy? Oi, that'll do -! Sergeant don't like language now he's after our Peggy, eh, Herbert? [Herbert laughs] What, he after your sister, Chad? We been away too long. She'll be off with the dairyman, now, him with the flat feet what can't fight! [men laughing] - [dramatic orchestral music] - [soldiers clomping] Right mad at you, sir! [men whooping] It's the Newcomer. Back from Mons, maybe? What's up with him? That's all we come home with, we'll be laughing, eh, sir? That's the spirit, Sergeant. [bird squawking] [Soldiers] Hooray! [children cheering] Company, halt! [Frank] Carry on, Sergeant. [Sergeant] Company, dismissed! [people socialising] [Arthur] So, Frank, hope I didn't let you down with His Majesty. Grumble, did he? No, he has his ways, his little shipshape ways. Oh, everything looks fine. My boys give a good account of themselves? Yes, as ever. Why Alec has signed up to go abroad, I'll never know. You want to keep me from the fun, Father? Ah, what business have you got with fun? Five little ones and you and Joan just starting out at Rolleston. You did your stint in Africa. And never fired a shot. [both laughing] That's young Evelyn, egging him on. Alec shouldn't rise to him. Arthur, you ought to get the King to make you Court Worrier. Send in the Territorials and the volunteers, it will be over before you can turn 'round. [weight clacks] 10 stone, eight pounds, Beck. Is that your regular weight? I'm a little lighter, sir, after training. If you've not gained four pounds by midnight, you may sue my cook. [all laughing] Four pounds is the daily rate for guests at Sandringham. Fatten them up and send them home, that's my motto. Now, we move on. Yes, sir. - [people socialising] - [cookware clattering] What is it, Ted? I can't stay. The Queen wants me fixing her hair before dinner. Your half-day, Sunday, meet me in Hunstanton. The lads are going for a last jaunt. Meet you? I dunno, Ted. [bell rings] Well, that's me, sorry. [Ted] Go on, meet me! Two o'clock bus, I'll be there. My dear mother simply adores this house, which is why I choose to give her the run of it while she lives and while I camp out with the Queen and our family at York Cottage. A noble sacrifice, sir. I rather enjoy the simple life. And if my mother wishes to spend more time there as she gets older, then all to the good, though I confess I've worried since our zeppelin scare. Still, I know Beck will guard her unto death. You're very kind, sir. Your brother's an excellent chap, Beck, but he's not a born land agent, not nearly as quick as you to anticipate one's needs. It's just a question of practise, sir. I'd say a question of instinct, but since you'll be here anyway, it hardly matters. I'll be here, surely not, sir? I'm to go on active service. We need efficiency at home as well as in the field. And, really, you're too old to fight, Beck. You'll stay at Sandringham. "I will give horses that won glory with their speed." "Call no man poor in booty or in precious gold," "if he be given my strong-footed horses." [George] What's that, Lieutenant Radley? The Iliad, sir. It's back in fashion amongst those of us about to prove ourselves on the plains of Troy. I'll give you a line, "If I should die," "think only this of me, that there's some corner" "of a foreign field that is forever England." Now, there's a poem. Do you know it? Of course, sir, highly effective. Brings in recruits by the shoal. Though, personally, I'll stick with the Greeks for inspiration. You, too, Captain Beck? I'm afraid the Greeks didn't appear very often in my education, sir. Nor mine. I'm afraid I let my mind wander from the schoolroom rather too often. Though not, I'm told, as often as my cousin Willi, the Kaiser. [people chuckle] Now, there he is dug in all over Europe. And we must go up through Turkey to keep our Russian friends supplied with the means to fend him off. This will be your second campaign, Doctor? Yes, sir, for my sins. I managed to help put paid to the Boer. What do we do, would you say, to put paid to the Turks? Act quickly, sir, under precise and detailed orders from a well-informed and far-sighted High Command, just as we did in South Africa. I believe those conditions can be guaranteed. [woman laughs] [people socialising] Why do you do it, Doctor? Why are you a lady-in-waiting? It is my occupation. Ditto, the drink. Alice has left me. Officially, she's sitting out the war with her parents in Sussex. When do you marry, Lady Frances, hm? After the war. How sensible. It's perfectly charming. You have such taste, Batterbee. I'd scoop you up and carry you off to London if it wouldn't upset my little French girl. I don't know as I'd take to London, ma'am, or anywhere outside Norfolk. Your brothers will leave soon. Herbert, isn't it? And Chad? Do they fear going out into the world? Oh, they're just full of themselves after training, ma'am. Go anywhere, do anything. [chuckles] Mr. Beck's efforts are appreciated? Greatly, ma'am, even if he is a stickler. [Alexandra chuckles] Mother says she'll not worry so much with Mr. Beck in charge. Don't know why she worries, anyway. It's all victory in the papers. Even victory costs lives, many lives. Yes, ma'am. I believe you're ready. [sighs] Yes. Yes, I believe I am. You'll be happy to be spared a parting, Mrs. Beck? Keep Beck with his family, hm? Yes, ma'am, though I suspect it grieves my husband if his age counts against him. Speaking as one who leaves for Turkey ahead of the rest, I could wish my age kept me with my family. You can't wish it, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards, surely not in the present situation. I'm as fit and ready to go as any of my youngest trainees and yet I can't share their experience. I think you mean to humour me. For heaven's sake, Beck, you've done your bit! You've turned a rag-bag of servants, grooms and gardeners into a superb fighting force. We respect you for it. Be satisfied. Sir. Mother dear, at last. Dinner. Would you take me in, Mr. Beck? It would be a pleasure, ma'am. Darling, shall I speak to the Queen? We could marry before you leave. No, no, I won't risk making you a widow. Well, why not? At least I would have been a wife. Let's wait until we have a clear future ahead of us. [dramatic orchestral music] [Pierrepoint] Most gracious God who has given us Christ and with him all that is necessary to life and godliness, we thankfully take this, our food, as the gift of thy bounty procured by his merits. Blessed to the nourishment and strength of our bodies to fit us for thy service. Amen. [All] Amen. [clock cranking] I know you're disappointed, Frank. The Queen understands, Mary. She'd let me go. Perhaps, but it's all been decided. Why brood about it? You said yourself the men could be back home in a few months. Covered in glory, and none of it mine. [children giggling] [Mary] What are you doing out of bed? Come on, back upstairs at once. [children grumbling] [people whooping and laughing] [waves crashing] [men socialising] [upbeat orchestral music] [bell dings] [Leader] By the centre, quick march! [drum beating] Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. You wish you was going with them? Better than mucking out. I'll not be mucking out. Mr. Beck spoke for me at the Post Office. I turn 12, I'll be on telegrams. You what? Telegrams, get a bike and a uniform. [gulls cawing] Listen. I'd've taken more time over this if I'd not been leaving. Look at you, Peg. You're so fresh and neat, and me, just a grubby old gardener. I like the way you look. You do? Well, what's it to be, then? You know enough about me, born and bred on the estate, both of us. I think I've loved you since we were at school. It's a big step. Shouldn't we go easy? No, we shouldn't. We should have some real loving before I leave, but I'd only want that if we were married. Oh, bless you, Ted. I do love you. Well, that's all right, then, isn't it? That's all right! [sentimental orchestral music] [Peggy giggles] Here, you cut that out, or you'll have me at it. [dog barking] [men playing] [water splashing] Private Croft, Private Croft! Am I to understand that you're leading this riotous mob? Only fun, Mr. Beck, sir. It looks like indiscipline to me! Has your training taught you nothing? Now, come on! Corporal? Come on, lads. Mr. Beck? Thought I knew the voice. I suppose someone else does your hardware supplies now, Mr. Beck, on the estate. I sold my business when Roland was shipped home from France. He was a Regular, remember? There you are. There's a good chap. Ah, he is a good chap. We had a beautiful letter from a Captain Buckland-Evers, saying Roland went bravely forward in the service of his country without regard for his own safety. He's a hero. That's what keeps us going. [Roland grunting] A drop more, old chap. Come on. He can hear us, Mr. Adams, but he can't communicate? We tried him with paper and a pencil in the hospital, but we had to take them away from him. What he wrote, it upset his mother, upset all of us, terrible stuff about what went on. What went on? He's not himself, never will be. [Roland grunting] Sorry, Mr. Adams, but we're filling up. We don't have the space for him. Excuse me, this man is a war hero! No matter, Mr. Beck. We move on to The George, now. One more drink and then he's had his bit of company for the day. [people socialising] Come on, Ted. There's Mr. Beck. Mr. Beck! We're to be married, Mr. Beck, me and Ted! Oh, say you'll give me away, do! Herbert's not keen, and with my dad gone, say you will, please. Say you will, sir. Of course I will. - Oh, thank you! - [men cheering] - [church bells tolling] - [swords clanging] [people cheering] [people socialising] [horses clopping] Oh, how charming. Oh, how charming you look. Thank you, ma'am. Isn't this a happy day? Remember me as a young bride, Mr. Beck? Coming to Sandringham? Indeed, I do, ma'am. You arrived at my father's house, and you stood in the doorway. I'd never seen anyone so beautiful. Oh. I'm convinced the men's best interests are served by officers who know them well and care for them. Do you agree? Of course, what can I do, ma'am. Your duty. I intend to find a way of showing support for you publicly. Thank you, ma'am. [horses clopping] [lively string music] [people cheering] [people clapping] [women laughing] In one. I don't kill nor do I injure. God told me I mustn't bear arms against my fellow man. Carry a stretcher, He says. That's all right. That's what I'll do. I don't mind coming under fire. Yeah, you don't mind welshing on a bet, either. God say something about that, did he? I'll give you your poxy five bob, first pay-day. I told you. [Herbert laughs] [Herbert] Anything I can get you, Doctor? What's your fancy? My fancy? Corporal, my fancy is a plump little waitress, rather unclean. You reckon you'd be any good to her in that state? Sorry, sir, it's not my place maybe. Cheeky bugger, this is my dance. I'm supposed to be going with Molly Blackett. Davy Croft. - Frank. - Hm? Talk to Evelyn. I can't handle him. You're afraid of that boy, Arthur. [both laughing] Enjoying yourself, Evelyn? Making a fool out of Alec? He's matching me, that's all, Uncle Frank. Toasting the bride, eh? Drink for drink. Till he falls down in front of the men? He's the eldest, senior rank. It's not my fault if he's not reliable. You're the one that's not being reliable. Now, take your brother outside and put his head under a tap, hm? [upbeat string music] Mr. Beck, I'd be happier if you were going with them, Mr. Beck. They're only boys. They're not boys, Peggy, not any longer. [dramatic orchestral music] [upbeat string music] [Frederick] Another contingent from the War Office to see His Majesty. Good news, let's hope, sir. Can't be long now. They'll come for us at night, tomorrow, probably. Does it alarm you? Me? I take what comes, sir. And how do you manage that? My nature, I suppose. You didn't ought to be so serious, sir, if I may say so. Why not go over and have a dance at the wedding? There's other officers there. [Frederick] No, I haven't danced since I was an undergraduate. Not even with her ladyship? [Frederick] We seem to agree I'm better with horses. You should try. Surprise her. You could do this, easy. One, two, three, one, two, three. One, two, three, one, two, three. One, two, three, one, two, three. One, two, three, one, two, three. I'd be hopelessly inept, I'm afraid. One, two, three, give it a go, sir. One, two, three, one, two, three. One, two, three, one, two, three. One, two, three, one, two, three. [sentimental orchestral music] - [lively string music] - [people socialising] [Boy] Oh, look at George! - Look at him! - How are you? [Boy] I don't believe it! This is me while you're on telegrams. [Luke] You never! You can't. You're only 14! [men socialising] What's this, George Dacre? I passed for service, Mr. Beck. You'll pass for an idiot when I get your birth certificate down to the recruiting office. I couldn't help myself. I got to go with the others. [men arguing] [men cheering] ♪ It's a long way to Tipperary ♪ ♪ It's a long way to go ♪ ♪ It's a long way to Tipperary ♪ ♪ To the sweetest girl I know ♪ ♪ Goodbye, Piccadilly ♪ ♪ Farewell, Leicester Square ♪ ♪ It's a long long way to Tipperary ♪ ♪ But my heart's right there ♪ [people cheering] What were you thinking of, Frank? George Dacre's a child. He's more of a man than I am. He is you. He's got something in him that you recognise, something you want to set free. Maybe he's free to get crippled, like the Adams boy. Frank, why can't you accept that you're staying here with me? Do you have to be a hero? It's not that, Mary. Truly, it's not. You know I love you. What is it, then? It's... Look at this place. It's paradise, paradise for the Queen to visit, a few times a year, but it's all the men know. It's all I know. [dramatic orchestral music] But when they come back, they'll be different, and I'll be the same. [people whooping and cheering] [people clapping] [Peggy whooping] Come on, let's go home. What a sendoff, never seen the like, have you? All that cheering and that? Come here, Ted. Look, Peg. Something's happened. I reckon I'm nervous. I'm not sure as I can do anything. And it could be our only night. We'll manage. [both smooching] [romantic orchestral music] Come on into me, now, Ted. I'm so ready for you. The vision of Sandringham is a vision of beauty and of a working community that stirs my heart more than words can express, a vision that one man has spent the last 30 years of his life turning into a reality, which is why I honour him today, in the presence of the King and Queen Mary. Captain Beck, we salute you, for your loyalty, for your long service, and for never neglecting your duty. Thank you, ma'am. [audience applauding] Your Majesties, I thank you most humbly for this magnificent gift. It's true, ma'am, I had a vision, and these men helped me to achieve it. And now they have another set before them, a vision to bring honour to their country in time of war. And I've decided that I must share this vision. Today, I signed to serve overseas with the fifth battalion of the Norfolk Regiment. [people cheering and applauding] [triumphant orchestral music] Listen to them, Georgie. Listen to them. [reverent orchestral music] I had a son once, and had he lived, he would've be standing here tonight. Now, I like to think that I have many sons. I've certainly held one or two of you rascals in my arms in the first few days of your lives. [men chuckle] So what shall I tell your families? I shall tell them that whilst we're away, I will be your father, and, God willing, I'll bring you all safely back home. Carry on, Sergeant Grimes. Yes, sir. Company, attention! Company, fall out! [men clomping] [dramatic orchestral music] Number one platoon, eyes right! Face right. Number one platoon, eyes forward! [men socialising] [man retches] What's going on? We dropped anchor two hours ago. Why aren't the holds open? It's not my business. I answer to the deck officer. Well, where is he? We can't move without food and equipment. You've got water, bully beef, biscuits and jam. The rest of it's not up to me. [Frederick] Were you prepared for this, Private Needham? I was never a boy scout, sir. Thank God. Seems a back-hander would work wonders. Get a hold open, four or five of us go in, grab what we want and out again. You fit, sir? I'm with you, Private Needham. I'll be back with the other lads, sir. [explosions booming] [men shouting] [men yelping] [water splashing] Captain Beck! Welcome to Turkey. [Frank] Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards, sir! Good to see you, you've survived your ordeal? Overcrowding, vomit and boredom? No, I have no doubt discovered that supplies will not flow to you like manna from heaven? I'm puzzled, sir. We were supposed to pick up a vehicle and load it with necessities from the ships. A vehicle and orders, I'm here eight days ahead of you and I can no longer connect orders to reality. [Frank] Mr. Edwards, is it true that some of our ships have been sunk? True, Captain Beck, and the survivors scraped off the cliffs like flies. Still, it's a novelty to be called to a man dying of his wounds rather than dysentery. If you'll forgive me, I'm dug in half a mile along the line to the north. Let's hope we meet again. - [explosion booms] - [horse whinnies] Yes, sir. [men socialising] [Ted] You all right, George? Bloody regulation seasick pills, what they doing? Testing them on us? Bastards! You should've spewed up straight like the rest of us, George. Feller along there landed two days ago. Says the Aussies copped it along the coast, copped it bad. He's after our supplies and all. Says his lot got nothing off their ships. You will each be directed to a point on the line between Gaba Tepe in the southwest and Kiretch Tepe in the northeast, where you will pitch camp. We're not yet sure of the Turks' exact position, but you'll receive messages as the information comes in. This gunfire, sir, it seems fairly close, barely half a mile away. A few stragglers in the shore battery, that's all, left over from the last engagement. Well, why don't we take them first before moving on, sir? That famous zeal, Captain Beck. Much admired in training, hardly appropriate here. We'll be ready for the Turks when they show themselves. And remember, though the Germans have attempted to impose some order, they are essentially barbarians and no match for a disciplined force of well-equipped soldiers. Thank you, gentlemen. All right, come on. Let's get going. - Sir? - Yeah. Radley's still on board with a detail. He's hoping to bag some more supplies. Who gave the orders? Sergeant, get the men fell in! Yes, sir. Men, get full line! Come on, let's get up and moving, eh, boys? Come on! [gravel crunching] [ominous orchestral music] [Ted] Peggy, my dearest love, well, this is me overseas for the first time. Eyes front! Nothing pretty about this place, though, just rocky ground and a rough road. I think often of your sweet face and how I shall kiss it when we next meet. [chickens clucking] [door knocking] Good afternoon, it's Mr. Yeoman, isn't it? I heard, in the Post Office, used to be your aunt's house. I knew the lady. I'm Mrs. Grimes, from the estate. Her Majesty, that's the Queen, Queen Alexandra, thought we should show our appreciation of your effort in the war. So, there's a few dainties here from the kitchen. We all have loved ones of our own in the war, see, in the Dardanelles. I expect you were wounded at Mons. Thank you, and you may thank Her Majesty for her kind gesture. Your hair. [Peggy laughs] I daresay there'll be more where these come from. No, there must be no more. Goodbye. [men socialising] From you all, boys, we need to get these tents up quickly. Stokes and Stubbard, make sure the guide ropes are tight, all right? Captain Beck, sir. Fancy a bit of bully beef, do we? - [Davy retches] - Urgh, Davy. [clock ticking] [Soldier] Sir, a man approaching sir! [Soldier] That's Lieutenant Radley, sir! [Soldier] And Private Needham, sir! [men cheering] Sorry we took so long, sir. Once Private Needham had bagged the transport, we had to pack it. All of this authorised? There's no one to authorise, sir. It's a free-for-all back there, sir, well, not exactly free. Lieutenant Radley shifted a fortune in bribes. There are rules, Lieutenant Radley, procedures governing the issue of supplies, as with everything else. My men are taught to follow the rules. This is reckless behaviour. I'll have no more of it. Permission to return the transport, sir? Permission granted. What do you say to the first cup of coffee since we left home, sir? I'd say bravo, Alec, bravo. Reconnaissance, we should be familiar with our area of defence. Now, I've marked the limits and they shouldn't be too difficult to cover. They are from the stretch of woods here in the west to the flat top hill in the east. You with me? - Yes, sir. - Mm-hm. Lieutenant Radley? The flat-topped hill is about two miles to the south, sir. What? I checked before I returned the carts. To the men who arrived before us, the maps are a joke. There's been an official complaint, but the word is we're to use our initiative and to make corrections. [explosion booms] Have you any further gossip for us, Mr. Radley? It's said that the enemy puts on rather a good show, sir. He's light on his feet, a genius at camouflage and strikes like a snake. He's also said to be closer than we think. [man groans] Dacre's recovered, complications of gut rot, no sign of dysentery yet, but we're already low on water. I know. What's the matter with Private Croft? [Davy groans] Oh, nothing much, a touch of fever. Fever, what kind of fever? Why wasn't it reported immediately? Is it the kind that will spread? Well, not unless the men's sleeping habits change drastically. Men's sleeping habits? It's a dose of clap, Captain Beck, gonorrhoea, caught from a girl in Liverpool the night before we sailed. I always put Private Croft down as a clean-living man. Instead of just a fool, you mean? Well, he should have gone armoured, like me. I had the same girl straight afterwards. Well, the Sandringham estate doesn't cater for every recreational need. Captain Beck, why don't I borrow one of those maps, hm? I'll take a couple of men on a reconnaissance and try to make a few corrections. At least we'll know whereabouts in hell we are. Sir? It's the stink and the cold at night, sir. It's a big shock after the heat. Any chance of more blankets? And the water's going down fast. There's no blankets, the stink's probably a fixture, and the water is meant to last 'til we move on. That's all right if we move soon, sir. Yes, well, I'm confident we will. Go on. Excuse me, sir. I think you got the time wrong. That's Sandringham time, Sergeant, so I always know what's going on there. [clock ticking] I keep remembering that old bugger of a swan off the lake. It'd come to me every day for his scraps. I hope Peggy thinks to feed him. It's the oaks in the spinney with me, August, clearing the first leaves. Did I know everything that went on there? I mean, if there was trouble on the estate, for instance, did I get to hear about it? By and large you did, sir. By and large? That's how I'd put it, sir. Ah, carry on. [tools clanking] [men socialising] Got a problem, Lieutenant? Oh, no problem, sir. Just about there. It might help if you had the feed block the right way up. [men snicker] [gun fires] - Corporal! - [whistle blows] - Sir? - Get me two men! [Herbert] Burge, Steadman, follow me! [dramatic orchestral music] [gun fires] Corporal, one wounded! All right. [George whimpering] Come on, Captain Beck. Come on, fall back! Fall back! [men shouting] [George sobbing] [Claude] Sting? Clean him up. It was heroic what you did for George Dacre. I'm going to mention you in my report. What for, a medal? You have the medal, Captain Beck. You'd scorn a medal? What else are we here for if not to prove ourselves as men? Well, I'm here to get the clean bullet through the brain that I don't have the courage to put there myself. I'd ask you not to take that line in front of the men. It's lowering. Meanwhile, we wait, snipers, of course, but no water, no supplies, I'll allow some conditions don't meet expectations. Expectations? I left my expectations with the Boers in South Africa, in a British concentration camp where I was supposed to keep the civilian population alive, women, children, and where I failed, for lack of support. [dramatic orchestral music] - [thunder rumbling] - [crickets chirping] [Ted panting] [suspenseful orchestral music] [gun clicks] [Frederick] For Christ's sake! Come and have a look at this, sir. [dramatic orchestral music] Didn't you tell me once we'd be fighting near the plains of Troy? "Then could be heard the voices of men, in their triumph" "and their glory, the slayers and the slain," "their blood spilling on the earth." This earth. Is that what it's about, sir? What you're reading? Killing and that? It's about rivalry and comradeship in war. I keep thinking I could be dead, no time. Can't get worked up about it. I reckon I've done most things I want to do in my life. Most things? Women? Oh, women, yeah, most things. How old are you? [Will] 18. I'm 28 and I've done nothing. Women? Nothing, this is the nearest I've ever got to living. We'll just have to get you a bit nearer then, won't we, sir? [men socialising] [explosions booming] - [men shouting] - [whistle blowing] Sorry I'm late, sir. [gunfire rattles] We go in tomorrow at a quarter past four. White patches will be sewn to the backs of officers' tunics, so that the men will recognise them in the field. [Claude laughs] Evelyn. Yes, Sergeant. We're in trouble, sir. I saw movements on watch last night. One of them bastards went by wearing a pig's head. A pig's head? No, they do that, sir. It's the talk of the line. You ask me, there's more of them, three or four maybe, setting up to the south now. When we move, they'll have us from behind. If there are snipers out there, we can't move forward until we flush them out. Mr. Radley, you will go on reconnaissance tonight. Sergeant Grimes will be your guide and take another man with you. Private Needham, sir. All right, very well. By the way, we have our first case of dysentery. So, if the Turks don't get us, we could die in our own shit. [mellow harmonica music] [Frederick whistles] [Soldier] Good luck, Ted! - [glass shattering] - [people shouting] What's happening? What's he done? He's no hero, that one. You know what he is? He's a bloody coward! He was injured, wasn't he? He belong with that lot what's trying to stop the war. That's in the papers. Came out of college, took a job in a hospital. Bunch of squatties recovering from their wounds in there threw him out the window, and good for them, I say. No, that's terrible, that is. Least he was working in a hospital. Do you fancy that? Go on, now, get home! You've done your worst. I got a husband and brothers in the fighting, but I don't go on like that. Go on, now, stop it! Go on, get home! Go on! Get home! Go on. Thank you. You were remarkable. [Peggy] You should've said. I know. I'm sorry. I'd very much like talk to talk... Don't say anything more! I can't be seen talking to you now. Come on, Luke. A pacifist? How unfortunate. I don't believe he's a coward, ma'am. We are compelled to believe he is a coward. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. You seem particularly low tonight, Grimes. You feel sorry for this man? Oh, it's not that, ma'am. If I'm gloomy, it's nothing I could tell you. If I should disapprove, I should quickly change the subject. I thought Ted might leave me with the hope of a child, ma'am, but it's not to be. Ah, well, for myself, I'm not sorry because I should hate to lose you. A cable from the War Office, Mother dear. The attack will be tomorrow. The men are expected to engage with the Turks in the late afternoon. Lord Kitchener is confident of victory. Well, let us hope his confidence costs us less in Turkey than it has in France, Georgie. [body squelches] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Will groans] [sword clinging] [men grunting] Where are they, you bastard? What have you done with them? [woman sobs] Jesus Christ! [both grunting] Right, you're having it, you are. You're getting it. [woman whimpering] I'm having you. All right, you're my prisoner. Move! - [gun fires] - [Ted gurgles] [dramatic orchestral music] [Soldier] That's Lieutenant Radley! [men shouting] [gun fires] [Frederick wailing] Lieutenant Radley! There's no chance. It's all right. It's all over, Radley. [Soldier] Where's Ted? [Frank] Where's Sergeant Grimes? [Frederick] He's gone. [groans] All right. [explosions booming] Corporal, get the men to gather around. Sir. Gather around, men. Not a funeral, for Christ's sake! What a bloody waste, huh? It's all bloody waste and chaos. And I'd not be in this bloody waste and chaos if it wasn't for you. [Evelyn] [chuckles] Have you ever heard of free will? I don't mean you egged me on. I mean I signed up to look after you. What an idiot, eh, me? They can't know, can they? Division, they can't mean us to walk to our deaths? You've always trusted the judgement of your betters, haven't you, Frank? That's fine for Sandringham or paradise. You will address the men, Lieutenant Radley. If I should die, think only this of me, that there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England. And there shall be in that rich earth a richer dust concealed, a dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, gave once her flowers to love, her way to roam, a body of England's, breathing English air, washed by the rivers, blessed by suns of home. [dramatic orchestral music] And think, this heart, all evil shed away, a pulse in the eternal mind, no less, gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given, her sights and sounds, dreams happy as her day and laughter learned of friends and gentleness in hearts at peace, under an English heaven. [dramatic orchestral music] [explosions booming] [men barking] [men shouting] [guns firing] [dramatic orchestral music] [whistle blowing] [train chugging] [train whistle blowing] [Peggy] Excuse me, have you seen this man? Sergeant Ted Grimes? - I'm sorry. - Or my brothers? Herbert and Chad Batterbee? Posted missing after Gallipoli? - All right there. - Sergeant Ted Grimes? Excuse me, have you seen this man, Sergeant Ted Grimes? Excuse me, have you seen this man, Sergeant Ted Grimes? He's my husband. - No, I'm sorry, love. - Or my brothers? Herbert and Chad Batterbee? Posted missing after Gallipoli? - Any news? - Nothing so far, Mr. Arthur. Have you got a photograph? [Luke] Sergeant Ted Grimes? You got no chance there, son. Would there be any news of Captain Frank Beck's Sandringham Company? Captain Beck? Sandringham? You want the Dereham lot for that. Just down the line from them, they were. - They saw them go. - Go? Where'd they go? Into the mist. No good asking me, you want the Dereham lot. They'll be drinking by now. Try The Wheatsheaf. The Wheatsheaf! Come on, Luke. You with us, Mr. Arthur? Oh, I'm due back. I've got the accounts to do. Mrs. Grimes, Mrs. Grime! Have this. You might need to buy a drink. [train whistle blows] "I regret to inform you that of about two hundred men" "missing to date only seven are classified" "by the War Office as prisoners of war." "None of them is from the Sandringham Company." It's not enough, Georgie. We are not doing enough. [Mary] Pappa, Grandmamma, the tree. Oh, the tree. [Nanny] George. [George] What a splendid sight it is, magnificent! How can we look at a tree? How can we celebrate? Of course we may look at a tree. We do not fail in our duty. Of course, we have our regulation three inches of water in our baths. Do you imagine I don't grieve? That my heart doesn't break at the slaughter? And not just for our own men? We put our trust in our generals. And we show the people, especially those who have lost their loved ones, that we do not countenance defeat. So what do you want, then? The tale of our brave assault on Hun and Turk? You saw the Sandringham men? My husband was with them, and my brothers. All we've been told is missing in action. Luck of the draw, missing. We reckon there's a load of missing 'cause they can't own up to 25,000 dead. British, that is. There were thousands of Aussies and Kiwis, too. Dead? You know they're dead? No, no, I'm not saying that. Please, just tell me what you saw. There was a mist that came down, the mist and them clouds with the queer shapes, Very thick to the east of the line, where your men were. [Lloyd] You heard of the Angel of Mons? No, no, I haven't. Terrible slaughter at Mons, same as for us. This mighty angel came into the sky to gather up the men as they fell. What? What are you telling me? There was no angel at Gallipoli, only the mist and the clouds that came down. That's what took the Sandringham men and Captain Beck. You know Captain Beck around here, eh? [men grumbling] He was a fine man and a good man. He led them, oh, straight back like a ramrod, he had. What a company, best in the line. He was making for a stretch of woodland, but before he could get amongst the trees, this mist came down. They'd all gone, all of them, never seen again. It's now the talk of the village, ma'am. We were there this morning. [Alexandra] A mist, you say? Or a golden cloud? We don't know what to make of it, ma'am. I know what to make of it. It's drunken soldiers' talk! Peggy! Please excuse her, ma'am. It's not just in the village. It's all over, ma'am, in the pubs, the markets. I don't mind saying that my wife and I take some comfort from it. There's often comfort in soldiers' tales. Oh, it is cruel to allow such stories to circulate, ma'am, cruel and vulgar. What if it were to get into the papers? It's all lies, wicked lies. There's no evidence that the men are dead, ma'am. There's not a single report from a fellow soldier nor a single possession returned. Perhaps, this mist that's spoken of prevented any view at all of their engagement with the enemy. I believe that many of them, most of them could be in prison, now, behind German lines. And do you believe in the hand of God, Mrs. Beck? I believe it's necessary to keep hope alive, Lady Frances. The estate could not function without it. Well, we need more than ever to know the truth, which will be a long time coming from the War Office, understandably. I shall make other inquiries. In the meantime, we must find comfort where we can. But you don't agree with it, ma'am! You can't! - You've just joined the show! - Peggy! I know what you really think! I've heard you talk! You think the war's a damn disgrace! Peggy, what are you doing? [Peggy screams] Peggy! [Peggy whimpering] Peggy, where are you going? Come back here! You should be working! I'm most dreadfully sorry, ma'am. One makes allowances. May I wish you good afternoon, ma'am? A word first, Mrs. Beck. I wish to commend you for your courage and your dignity. Ma'am? I'm painfully aware that you would have your husband beside you now had I not urged him to go. The man who stayed behind would not have been my husband, ma'am. He'd have been someone else, someone destroyed. He lived... He lives for the estate. He lives to serve you, ma'am. I shall continue my efforts with that in mind. - [dramatic orchestral music] - [Peggy sobbing] [door knocking] I've seen the way you look at me. [door slams] [both smooching and panting] You want this? I don't know. I don't care. [both moaning] [reflective piano music] [people socialising] [doctor speaks in German] You, you are lucky, you know, to have been picked up by the Germans. This is good. You have more operations to come, but there's a backlog, you understand? The wounded keep coming. [metal creaking] [Kamal] This place is not suitable for a burial ground. [Pierrepoint] Today, I'm not wearing my War Graves Commission hat, Professor Demiriz, ah, that is to say... Yes, yes, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards, I am familiar with the notion of wearing a hat. Today, you wear the hat of Queen Alexandra's investigator. Do you know about the cloud that came down on the day of the battle? The miracle? Of course, everyone knows about it. You, of course, don't believe it? I believe an entire company of soldiers disappeared and has never been heard of since. Dead, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards, among the unknown thousands. What else? You waste your time. Is it true that your countrymen did not take prisoners? It's true that taking prisoners is a luxury, enjoyed by economies who can afford to plan, build and maintain prisons, and to feed prisoners. And that's how you justify a massacre? What did you, the British, expect? You were the invaders. Before you speak of massacre, speak of betrayal, and see if the blame doesn't lie closer to home. [dramatic orchestral music] Lunacy, the whole campaign, thousands upon thousands killed or wounded and for nothing. Strike tents. If we leave now, we can be back at the bay before dark. A wise decision, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards. Leave the miracle intact. And what will you tell Queen Alexandra? She has sent others before you. Even during the war, the American Ambassador came. [man exclaims] [Kamal speaking in foreign language] [clock ticking] Sandringham time, Captain Beck? Local time, I've put the past behind. All right, we make for the woods in the west and then take the village if we can. All right, carry on. Men, have Sandringham in your hearts. We fight today so we can return there and take up our work again with dignity and respect. Before we left home, I made a promise to you, a promise that I would be like a father and protect you from any dangers that would beset us. I realise now that that was a promise that I couldn't keep. I'm not your father but I am your brother. And all that I can promise in brotherhood is that I will stand by your side and face what you have to face. [men muttering] - Well done, sir. - Thank you, sir. [George whimpering] All right, lad, I'll be with you. My fiancee admires you, Doctor. I can't think why. If I live, I shall break our engagement. If you live, be kind to her. You almost make me want to live. I'm sorry about Needham. Evelyn, take your brother's hand. He doesn't want it, Uncle Frank. You don't want it. You don't want that he's the eldest and in line for my job. You don't want the farm because he gets the estate. You're choked up with not wanting. Now, let it go. Here's your five bob, Herbert. Keep it. I'd only do something stupid with it. You'd get a couple of Scouse tarts for that and change over. 'Course, you'd get the clap as well. [Chad] Say a prayer for us, sir. [dramatic orchestral music] I'll give you the soldier's prayer. Dear Lord, you know what I must do this day. If I forget thee, do not forget me. Amen. [Soldiers] Amen. All right, carry on, Sergeant. [Sergeant] On your feet, fix bayonets! [bayonets clattering] [men whooping] [clock ticking] [whistle blows] [engine rumbling] You see in what high regard our Sandringham men were held, Mr. Edwards? Indeed, sir. And Beck, as their leader? I wanted him to stay at home, of course, but there you are, he's immortalised now. A remarkable man. And what have you to tell us, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards? We heard several versions of the story, ma'am. However... I hope you do not doubt what we were told by the War Office. I believe, ma'am, that, at the time, it was advisable for the War Office to give the most acceptable interpretation of what happened. And I'm sure you do not intend to distress my mother, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards. And is it acceptable to claim that the men simply disappeared? What is the alternative? Ma'am, please come and see. Oh, his poor face. [dramatic orchestral music] It's Grimes. He's come back to us! Could it be? Is it possible they will all come back to us? [explosions booming] [men shouting] [guns firing] One, two, three! Get up, Chad! Come on, Corporal, leave him. Come on! [dramatic orchestral music] Stretcher over here! [explosion booms] [Claude gasping] Oh God, Howlett. All right! [gun fires] The heights are over here, sir! All right, come on! Come on, Sandringhams! Sandringhams! - [men shouting] - [guns firing] [explosions booming] We're behind Turkish lines, sir. I know we are. I'm well aware of that, Mr. Radley. We can't turn back now. Head for the building that's our cover. George, come on! George, come along! Get to the cover! You'll be safe, go on! The building is our objective! Take cover there! [Kamal] They fought like heroes. Is it necessary to go on? [Pierrepoint] Yes, it is necessary. - [guns firing] - [explosions booming] [Alec grunts] [men shouting] Alec, not you! Get up old chap! Come on, please! He's gone! What are we gonna tell Mother, Uncle Frank? Oh, my boy. What are we gonna say? All right, all right, come on. Sergeant, help get these two men to cover! Come along, get undercover, move! [Soldier] Sir! - [guns firing] - [men shouting] [explosions booming] Make sure the area is safe! Come on! Come on, boys. Come on! Forward! [men yelping] Evelyn! Evelyn! No, no! No, those men are your prisoners! [Turkish shoulder barks] You are obliged to take prisoners! [gun fires] [gun fires] No, no, Mr. Beck! Oh, Mr. Beck! [gun fires] [dramatic orchestral music] My boys. My boys, my dear, my dear boys. [gun fires] [dramatic orchestral music] They left me for dead. I lay there. I don't know how long. And then the Jerries found me and patched me up. I can't say I was treated bad in the hospital, ma'am. Do you know of any other prisoners from Sandringham? No, no, ma'am, and there'll be none now. I was in the last batch coming back. I do know what happened to them, though, to Mr. Beck and the rest. You do? You mean you haven't heard, ma'am? It was famous. All the prisoners talked about it. [George] Tell us what you know, Grimes. Well, it's a bit of a miracle, isn't it? They went over the top that morning, [dramatic orchestral music] Captain Beck leading, and all of them in good heart. It seems there was low-lying cloud, massing since the night before, and, as they pressed on, the cloud, well, it came down and covered them. It drew them in as if God himself was wrapping it 'round them. And that was the last anyone saw of them. I tell you, ma'am, I shall miss them all for the rest of my days, but I can't grieve for them. [Lady Frances whimpers] If you'll please me, ma'am, I must find my wife. You know she's no longer at Sandringham? Mother says she did something bad, but I'll not believe it. She'll have had a reason. I have to see her. Lady Frances will send for the trap to take you to the village. Before that, let us hear first what Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards has to say. He knows more of the truth than all of us. Mother, dear, this isn't appropriate. It is in all our interests to find out as much as we can, Georgie, even if it means Grimes losing something of his story. I'm very much afraid, ma'am, that I have nothing to add. Nothing, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards? Nothing, ma'am, except this. I bought it from a Turkish officer who says he found it on the battlefield. There is a trade in these things. [Alexandra] Tell Mrs. Grimes she's welcome to return here with you, if you can persuade her. Mother, that is hardly proper. Please tell her I would welcome her. Ma'am. Do you think we may safely build our memorials now, Mr. Pierrepoint Edwards? Yes, ma'am, I do. [engine rumbling] [dramatic orchestral music] [clock ticking] - [whistle blowing] - [dramatic orchestral music] [Frederick] "The warrior sank in the dust" "and his armour fell around him." "Blood-stained, the gold of his hair." "He is as a handsome tree that stands" "against each blast of wind and blossoms thickly" "with white flowers, until there comes, suddenly," "a wind so fierce that the tree is torn up from its roots," "and is laid out, its whole length, upon the earth."
