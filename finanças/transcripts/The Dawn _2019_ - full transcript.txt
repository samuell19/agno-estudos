What am I supposed to be looking for? All I see is dirt. The first part of respecting nature is understand it. The soil, has stories to tell. It has lessons to teach. We become it. How do you know all this great grandfather? My father taught me the importance of the world around me. Now I'm teaching you. My father gave it to me. He said it was a barrier between good and evil. Does it do something? I saw it save my father's life. Thank ya. So remember, we're gonna keep it positive today, okay? Okay, thank you Rose. William! Supper! The children are waiting! What have we told ya? It isn't polite to stare. Even if it is your father. Thought we agreed? No tools at the table. No work. I was fixing the mailbox. Right. Now grace. Would you like to lead us? Dear Lord, bless us and these gifts for these I give what you're about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. Thank you Rose. I hope we all understand how important it was to thank our Lord. I mean, we've been given many obstacles, but each meal is a blessing. Each day is a blessing. Here. Will you let me help ya? Don't touch me! Let me bleed out! Let me bleed. Let me bleed out. I said let me bleed! Hank. What happened? What is wrong with him? Your father is sick. Did he hurt you? No I'm not hurt. Just finish your dinner okay? Finish your dinner. Lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. William. No, please! It isn't real! Please, it isn't real! Hank. I can do it Hank! I can set you free! I can't let you hurt anymore! Listen to me! No, don't go back there. They're only gonna hurt you. I can free you. I'm not Hank Papa. I'm the pathway to God. Listen to me! I can set you free. Rose! Run Rose! Run! I am the pathway to God, listen to me! Run! I can't let you kill Hank! Looks like we figured out where those gunshots we heard came from. Yup, looks like it. I used to have to drive him home drunk after the war. Said he used to see things. I always figured it was the whiskey. Quanah here brought him home a few times too. Did William's wife see this? She's passed on too. The kids? Same. Oh my God! Except for his eldest. Where is she? I don't know Sarge. Let's find her. Now! Now, now! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! You don't have any other family, do you? Aunts or Uncles, Grandparents? Anything? No. You have nowhere to go? No. I'll find somewhere on my own. No. Not without family and not with winter approaching. Look, there's a place I know of, a couple of states away. I spent some time there as a child myself. If you don't have anyone to stay with, better than the state putting you in an orphanage. What is it? Well, reminds me of a castle. Like in Europe? Yes, a lot like that. But with no wars? I can assure you, there's no war there. The wars did this. I know. If you go, you won't have to worry about anything like that. Okay? It's a good place, it's a good home. Henry. There's something I think you need take a look at. What might that be? This morning a girl was taken to Saint Johns. She lost her family. That's not unusual. Not now. It's the circumstance. I think you need to take a look at this. I'll be in touch with the Reverend Mother. I know her well. You must be Rose. I'm Reverend Mother Agnes. I'm told you're going to stay with us. Start at the beginning. You mean my childhood? Yes. We've been through this. You know my childhood. Your self-doubt stems from more than just your father. I don't like thinking of my father. But you do. Of course. Every day since I've been here. Surely there was more to your home life than your fathers illness. Reverend Mother calls them dreams, not an illness. We agree on many things, but psychology is not one of them. The intricacies of the human mind are one field where I feel that not only are we still learning, but so is the Lord. The soul grows as it should. That's correct. Have you considered taking your final vows? Yes, of course. All the time. But you're not ready? I feel that I could do more. More for the church, more for the world. I hear about the worsening situation with Europe, in Germany, and in Austria. Isn't there something the church can do? We pray for them. But first, we must remember, all action begins with one person. Who? That person is you, Rose. Good afternoon Sister Rose. Sister Ella. Oh, I believe the first frost has gotten to Jeremiah. I think he gets to most people more than they think. You know, he barely speaks to me. Ever since he arrived, he just stares. Maybe he thinks you're pretty. No. He's confusing me with you. Besides, you know it's inappropriate. I wouldn't give it much thought. I'm sure he's harmless. I mean if he weren't, Father Theodore would never have invited him here. I suppose you're right. Yeah. You know, you must do a prayer session today. I was busy. Busy? Well, after much contemplation, I believe I'm ready. I've decided to take my final vows. Already? It's been eight years Rose. It's time. You're right. You know, it's been really cold lately. Nothing that a good hot cup of tea won't solve. Yes but, my cup is frozen solid. Inner peace, is the best fire. Come on. I saved you a seat. Thank you. Sisters, please settle in your seats. And fold your hands. Before we begin our dinner, Father Theodore would like to share a blessing with us. Thank you Reverend Mother. Please bow your heads. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the holy spirit. Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. We have so much to be thankful for in the warm embrace of God. His gifts surround us. His wisdom surrounds us, it nurtures us each day. Even an old man like myself learns something new every day because of our Lord. Amen Father. God wants to tell you what you want to hear. You just have to be willing to listen. Now speaking of gifts, let us all enjoy this communal supper. The soup smells especially delicious. Excuse me. It's a perfect way to stay warm. May I pour you some soup? That would be lovely, thank you. Can you pass the rolls please? Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Rose. I came for you. Is something troubling you? No You're simply occupied. It's cold. Feel. Okay. Do you feel it? It's freezing. I'm sure it is a reasonable explanation. But I'm not freezing. Every day it gets worse. Have the nightmares returned? I'm not my father, if that's what you're implying. Dreams Rose. Just as with your father, they were only dreams. It's how we react to them that matters. When you first came here we embraced you as one of our own. Yet, there are certain things you still choose to face alone. Even in your room, you're never alone. The Lord God is all around us. You lost your family. God is your family. We are your family. Thank you. And a last piece of advice for you is, get some rest. I'll do what I can. Goodnight Rose. Goodnight Reverend Mother. Looking for you. Looking for you. Looking for you. I'm not gonna hurt you! Cold. For 10 years, the dream remains the same. The nightmares feel so real. As if I've awoken in another life. Each day I question my reality, and each day it grows harder. I worry one day I'll wake up unable to distinguish this life from the other. I only hope in writing down my thoughts and drawing what I see, that I'll be able to save myself, should it come to that. How is it? What? The tea, how is it? Oh, it's cold. You're a lot like Father Theodore. How do you mean? The tea's never good enough. Not like he has any basis for comparison. I don't think he's been more than five miles from here since he was 12-years-old. We all have our story though. Lillie, she had a husband and he lost all his money in the crash. He put a gun in his mouth. Sister Ella, she found Jesus in the bottom of a bottle and never came up. Their mistakes all brought us to salvation. My fathers mistake led me here, not my own. Are you at peace with your father's mistake? Nice speaking with you Jeremiah. What was Jeremiah talking to you about? Traveling. Have you ever traveled? Before? Yes. No, just from my family's home to here. Where was that again? Western Pennsylvania. You ever been there? No, I can't say that I have. Just South Carolina to here. Well you're not missing much, so... How was South Carolina? Life wasn't very welcoming for me there. I saw some bad things, and I almost let them get the best of me until one morning I woke up, no home, no place to go, and I knew I needed to change. What did you see? I think that's a conversation best had at another time. This is a new life. We cannot allow ourselves to be judged by the misdeeds of our past. Sister Lillie is right. Sounds to me like you're running from your past. No. Absolutely not. Making peace with your past and running from your past, are two different things. Maybe that's why you're not ready to take your final vows. You don't have to be condescending. I only want what's best for you. For everyone for that matter. If you need my help moving on from the past, I can help you. But ultimately, it comes down to one thing. What thing? You. The Sisters can only take you so far. But your willingness to surrender to God, is a choice only you can make. I learned that being here. And that's how I intend to live my life. You're right. It's not about being right. It's about peace. Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. Since the frost came, I can't breath. The air dries my throat. Every morning when I wake up, I feel like I can't speak. Dear Rose, it sounds more like you need a doctor than a confession booth. But it's not that kind of dry... I feel alone. I feel frozen. Tell me about your last night at home. All I remember is the pain in my fathers eyes. "Kill me. "Kill me" he used to say. What else? There was a rhythm. Consistent. Like a clock. A clock? Not something you'd see on the wall. Something else. Tick, tock, tick, tock. My world's falling apart but my heart is steady. It was at ease. Is this a sin? Should I have been that calm? That calm is what saved your life. I have felt your regret since you arrived. But rather than it disappear over the years, it's grown. I'm sorry Father. God meant for you to have these emotions. They're ultimately a test. Designed to strengthen your faith. I don't care, I'm so happy to be out of the cold. Sister Ella, Sister Lillie. Sister Ella. Showing up late to take all the credit? What? Don't listen to her. I need to ask you guys something. Of course. Have you noticed anything strange around here? Well everything around here seems normal. Now when I was at Saint Christopher, that was strange. It's painfully normal. The cold is painful. I'm used to it. So no? Are you okay? Rose. I'm not going to hurt you. I know, I'm sorry. Old habit. Well you feel fine to me. Rose, when I was younger, I lived by a lake. And I watched my brother fall through the ice. We would cross the lake as a shortcut and he'd always go ahead. I heard this dry crack, and he was gone. Swallowed. He died that night of hypothermia. That's when I knew hell was cold. If you're not feeling well, ask for the doctor. Don't just sit in your room and hide. Okay. Good. Let's go. I can't distinguish dreams from daylight, memories from nightmares. I'm seeing things that aren't there. I'm hearing things that don't exist. At the moment Father, I feel that, you're the only one I can confide in. Father. Father? Sorry Rose. Hi Jeremiah. I didn't mean to startle you. Do you know where, where Father Theodore is? Yeah, he's preparing a sermon for midnight mass. No, he was just here. I was speaking to him. No, well I've been here for over an hour and you were in the booth when I got here and you're alone. He's not here? No he's not here. Were you listening to my confession? I tried to ignore it but, I'm on floor duty this week, so... I promise I won't tell anyone. You can trust me. I have to go. If you truly believe something strange is happening here, you have to determine if it's something with this convent, or something centered around you. Let me pass Jeremiah. I'll let you pass, but you have to answer the question. You can't ignore it. It's me. It's always been me. That's why you haven't taken your final vows. Yes. And you'll admit it to me but you won't admit it to Father Theodore. You've seen more of the world than he has. Well yeah, there's something here. It's not inside you, it's part of you. It's part of the flesh. It's my father. Maybe. It's shared, it's reborn in you. You can go. Go. Show trust O Lord, that those who love Your name will exalt in You. Kill them. A demonic presence was drawn to my attention years ago. Looking for you. We were so close to casting it out. Time to get the ritual started! This is the blood of Christ! The precious blood of Christ! No! I cast you out! Fight it! Where is she? I don't know. I'm worried about her. ♪ When peace like a river ♪ ♪ Attendeth my way ♪ ♪ When sorrows like sea billows roll ♪ ♪ Whatever my lot ♪ ♪ Thou hast taught me to say ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ ♪ It is well ♪ Sister Rose! I'm sorry. Mother Reverend, I apologize. Rose! Reverend Mother is looking for you. I'm sorry Father, I'm not feeling well- - You need to rest. You're clearly exhausted. You're right. I am, I just... I... Rose. I'm sorry Father. Rose! Rose! Please, please Jesus. I never cared for your choices of tea. And that's two. Two? I told Rose that we only disagreed on human psychology. Apparently I've inadvertently lied to her. We also disagree on tea. I'm sure you'll be forgiven. I would hope. What did you and Rose speak of? The details of confession are strictly confidential. I'm concerned for her well-being. I know what it's like to have a past that follows you. That's what it was. Her past. She carries it on her shoulders. Sometimes I can almost see it. You aren't much different. The bottle was my vice. Gambling was my vice. I never met my parents. I'd call to call on Father Henry to evaluate Rose. Henry doesn't specialize in troubled young women coming to terms with their past. He specializes in something that you and I don't see. I don't know if I'm right, but if I'm wrong, I'd rather treat her early. Childhood trauma isn't a reason to assume we need Henry. This isn't the 1600s. There's more to it. Come and embrace me Lord. Hold me secure. Hold me strong. Hold me forever. In Your everlasting arms, amen. Amen. Peace be with you. And also with you. I would like to welcome everyone here for this celebration of the solemn profession of Sister Ella to the holy spirit. It is an important moment for our community, Sister Ella, and of course our church because it is a moment of witness. A declaration of vows in faith, which represents a small inkling of hope the world sorely needs. Dear Sister, are you now resolved to unite yourself more closely to God? I am. Are you resolved with the help of god to undertake that life of perfect chastity, obedience, and poverty chosen for themselves by Christ our Lord and His virgin mother, and so persevering it forever. I am. Are you now resolved to live alone for God in persevering prayer, in willing penitence, in humble work and holiness of life? I am. No, no, no, no! Fight it Rose! Fight it, please! Fight it! Fight against it Rose. Fight the evil Rose! Good morning Father Henry. Where is Theodore? He's hearing confessions. We need help. We need someone with your expertise. Last time you called on me we performed an exorcism on an alter boy and his parents sent him to an asylum. He was a quiet boy. Innocent. I found this in my room. There were more in the hallways and other rooms. Have you ever seen anything like this before? I've seen crosses fly off of walls. I've seen them turned upside down. I have never seen anything like this. This looks like someone tossed it under a combine. You have a source? It's Rose, Henry. I'd like to meet with her as soon as possible. Of course. Father Theodore. Father Theodore are you here? Father Theodore. Yes my child. Forgive me Father for I have sinned. I don't know how long it's been since my last confession because I've lost all sense of time. I don't know past from present, I don't know right from wrong. Go on my child. Set your worries aside. No one can hurt you here. God will protect you. I haven't been entirely honest with you. I've been seeing things. I've been hearing things. I'm cold inside but, my skull is burning. I have visions of memories that aren't mine. I should be in mine, inside of time. God has laid a special path for each of us. The test is physical, but also mental. Focus on your breathing and listen to your heart. That is a special bond between you and God. It beats in rhythm and He hears it. The rhythm. Like a clock. Steady. Steady. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I cast you out! Out of this daughter of God! Out of this child of Christ! When you were younger, an altar boy named Christopher came to me with similar symptoms. By this blessed holy water! Kill him! Kill him! He complained of fever when he was cold. He claimed to hear voices. See visions. But there was nothing there. Father! Father please! Father Theodore! Soon he became destructive. We called in one of my colleagues with an aptitude for exorcism. Father Henry. Please! Father Theodore! It was the worst pain I'd ever seen another human being in. No! It would writhe, and twist, and scream profanities. The closest thing that I could compare it to would be, from what I understand of childbirth. Given this situation, it was rebirth. Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Have you seen Rose? Not since choir rehearsal. Something's wrong. What is it? I don't know. But something's definitely wrong. Quanah, Quanah, I need your help. Please, I need your help. The others have failed me. God has failed me. Please don't let me become my father. Please, don't let me become my father! Sister Rose. What is this? A prayer. It doesn't look like any prayer I know. Looks like a pagan ritual. Worship the earth in witchcraft. It's not. Don't tell anyone that it is. I won't. Reverend Mother called in a specialist. He'd like to speak with you. What is it? I'm confused, you have to tell me what's going on. I don't know, I can't explain it. But it's Rose. Oh Father help us! Oh my God. Did Rose do that? I hope not. No, no thank you. You're freezing, at least hold it. God, I feel like I'm burning! Well what do you think it is? I don't know! Whatever it is, it took my family, and now it wants me! So maybe I should just go see this specialist! Well he's aware of you. He's known about you since your childhood, since you were brought here. Why? Precaution. Have you seen any of the signs? Who was with him in here last? I think it was Rose. Where is she? She wasn't at the commissary. You don't think she did this do you? I certainly hope not. Ella, Lillie, leave this place at once. Go to Saint Jude's two towns over. Of course. Thank you Reverend Mother. Quickly, please! What signs? Unseen voices, slip from reality, hunger pains, sensitivity to light, but most importantly, you're a virgin to spirituality. Wait, a virgin? You've been here since you were a child and you've yet to take your final vows! Why? Father Theodore says it's because of regret. Regret? Yes. Regret is an emotion. It's not even real, it's not tangible. Why have you not taken your final vows? Look, I don't know what you want me to say! Whatever shares your body is restraining you. It's something else, it's something living. You're mad. You're frightening me! Stop it! You're frightening me! What I saw you doing isn't anything a child of God would do! Worshiping the earth? People were burned alive for less! I'm saving your soul Rose! These walls are thin! You killed Father Theodore! There's evil within you! You're a freak! You're an abomination! No! No! Let us continue. Dear God, let her pray for your love and light to come into her. Oh dear Father, may she be your child. Dear Jesus Christ, Redeemer and Savior, forgive Sister Rose of her sins. Just as you forgave Peter his denials. As you forgave those who crucified You. Lord, forgive her of her sins and her transgressions, we gravel at her repentance and her tears of sorrow. A fight against the powers of darkness in this world. Help us against the rulers of hell in high places. Dear Lord, help us. The spirits of wicked faith in high places! And rulers and principalities in power, and spirits of darkness! - Help us Lord! - Help me! The spirits in high places, help us to fight! What is this? Help me! Jeremiah! What is this? Where am I? Where you've always been. In the convent. This room. What? Where's Reverend Mother? You've been here all this time, many years. We've tried nearly everything. Where's Reverend Mother? She's dead! You're lying to me! Fight it Rose, you must fight! Fight it! Oh my God. What? What? My book. My book! I drew in my notebook! I draw, I draw, the outside of this room. I draw outside, I draw animals, they're peaceful. I'm at peace. Please. Please. Please. Please. I draw. I don't see forests! I don't see happy little animals! Does this look peaceful to you! Look at it! No! No! No! Look at it! No! No, no, no, no! You've been here since your family was killed! No, no, no, no! Fight it Rose! Fight it! Please, fight it! The rulers of darkness in the world against the spirit of wickedness in high places! Father. It was blessed by the Vatican. It wasn't easy to get. Desperate times Father. We're all here with God. I cast you out. Out of this daughter of God. Out of this child of Christ. By this blessed holy water and by the blood of Christ, Redeemer Lord, Savior, remember not her sins as you forgot the betrayal of Peter and those who crucified You. Count not her transgressions, but rather, her tears of repentance. - Remember not her iniquities, - Damn you! But for her sorrows - for the offenses she has - Damn you! Committed against thee! There's something in, there's something in me! It's within, it's a man! Rose. Rose. Rose. I'm sorry I wasn't there to watch you grow. I was in pain, and I let it defeat me. Don't let it defeat you. Don't let it defeat you Rose. I love you. All of the days of her life! Be cursed with the power of Christ! I cast you out! Lord Jesus Christ! True light! That it lightens every man and woman who comes into this world! Blessings upon these earthly candles, and enlighten them with thy heavenly grace! You want this? Quanah. I trusted you. I trusted you! I told you about my father. I am not who you think I am. No! And now you're gonna burn with this! Inner peace is the best fire. For 10 years now, the dream remains the same. The nightmares feel so real. My only hope in writing down my thoughts and drawing what I see, that I'll be able to save myself. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. All aboard! Last stop, Long Island!
