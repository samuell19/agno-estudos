Oh, my God. Oh, gorgeous. Did somebody die or something? Vamonos, amigo, we got a boat to catch. I'm not going with you, Señor. Uh... I paid for a truck and a driver. - That's you, let's go. - No, Señor. Why not? Gato fantasma. The ghost cat. A long time ago, my people thought he was a white devil. To protect their villages, they gave him human sacrifices. Fed him human flesh until this was all he would eat. The old ones say he still goes in the jungle, hunting down men, women, and children, eating them alive. Diego, Diego, Diego. I don't know much about your myths and legends, but she is a white Jag, she's one of a kind, she's worth a million bucks, and she is not, repeat, not a man-eater. She's a house on Pine Lake. So... how much more do you want? It's not the money. It is to me. Señor Frank, your bird. That thing is not my bird. Hey, are you kidding me, man? Get out of there! All right, Diego, you wanna stay... stay. But do me a favor. Why don't you just get your kids some damn shoes? What about your truck? I have a friend in Santana. He'll meet you at the dock in Phillippe and drive it back to the village. Follow the map. Looks like Long Beach. - You're in danger, Señor Frank. - Now I know it's Long Beach. All right. Enjoy your cruise, Señor! Can't go to Puerto Rico. If I lose a day, I lose my trucks in Mexico. You can use the ship's radio to make other plans. What if I can't make other plans? Well, then you will do what you must! You're looking at a lawsuit, Leo. You're looking at a big, fat lawsuit. Yeah, yeah, I hear you, Frank. You're an American. Of course I'm looking at a lawsuit. Take it easy with my cat! - What do you think of that? - Hey, hey! - What is it? - White Jag. 350, maybe 400 pounds. She's one in a million. She's not happy. She doesn't like people. Just like you, Frank. You guys sure you're in the right place? Oh, I get it. Silent but deadly, huh? Hey. Who the fuck are you guys? U.S. Marshals. So nice to see American faces. So, where you all from? You need to keep quiet, you scumbag piece of shit. From Virginia, huh? You were born there, then you moved out west, am I right? - I'm very good with accents. - I said, shut the hell up. You need to relax. Oh, hey, good morning to you. How about you and I, we go and meet up at the Polo Lounge for cocktails, say around five o'clock? Does that sound good? Just don't tell your boyfriend about it. It's gonna be a nice day once the clouds burn off, - don't you think? - Yeah, sure. See you on the main deck. We can buddy up for the Shuffleboard tournament. I'd really like that. That'll be great. All crew members to their stations. Harrison and Barnett? Bridge and Communications. You seem like a really wound-up kind of guy. - You ever tried meditation? - Just don't talk. - Am I right? - Don't talk. Richard Loffler, my name is Paul Freed. I'm the United States attorney. You are under arrest for the murder of Undersecretary William Woodington. - Uh-huh. - And for crimes against humanity in Lucanamarca... - Uh-huh. - ...Chincheros... - Uh-huh. - ...Santo Tomás... - Uh-huh... - ...Lircay... - Mm-hmm. - ...Juliaca... - Mm-hmm. - ...Wankas and La Oroya. That was my favorite one. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used as evidence against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you prior to any questioning if you so desire. Do you understand these rights as I have described them to you? Paul, can you get me a Coke with some extra ice? Be a sweetie, huh? - Cubed or crushed? - Crushed. This is Dr. Ellen Taylor, she's a neurologist and a lieutenant in the United States Navy. She'll be monitoring your condition. Wow. I'm not armed. Seizures can happen without warning. Call me immediately. Be ready to describe his physical symptoms in detail. My radio will be on 24 hours a day. Thank you. Stand up, please. It's so nice to see you again, Dr. Ellen, hmm? Dr. Ellen, you make sure to tell me when the appropriate time is for me to turn my head and cough. Maybe next time. I'd like that. Prepare the engines for departure, Mr. Scuddy. Make sure the fuel filters are clean and test for full power, Jerome. Let's get out of here. No, no,. Rice. Whatever. More, more. Corn. Okay. - Pan, get a pan. - No, no. Hey! Hey, calm down, man. Yes. I never did get my Coke. Mm-hmm. I really hope I could repay the favor someday. Whatever, asshole. Captain Morales tells us you hunt animals for zoos, Mr. Walsh? I hunt animals for myself. I sell them to zoos. My father was on the board of the San Diego Zoo - for many years. - That's nice. Hey, is it just me, or is anybody else here wondering who this asshole is and what he's doing on this ship? I'm afraid that's classified. Well, perhaps you should classify this. All right? We're on a ship, pal. We have a right to know something. Well... his name is Richard Loffler. He was the lead assassin for the Sword of God, Espada De Dios, a violent terrorist army in Peru. He American? Marine commando, Overseas Special Forces. Navy pulled him back for psychiatric counseling, but the NSA liked what they saw. Made him a counter terrorist. NSA tried to pull him out, they couldn't get him. He escaped to Brazil, some locals picked him up. Why didn't they just shoot his ass when they caught him? That's how they roll down there. Mm-hmm. We asked them not to. We want him to stand trial at home. Tell us about the, uh, white cat, Mr. Walsh. Beautiful, isn't it? Zoo outside of Madrid wants a black jag. 75 grand. That's a whole lot of, ha, beans, Walsh! It ain't half-bad, Scuddy. So, what then, Frank? Well... I'm in the jungle. Pick up a trail. I know it's a jag, and I figure they'll take it anyway, even if it has spots. And then... she steps out into the sun, and she's snow fucking white. Well, I'm sure that zoo will be happy. No, well, you see, Doc, once again, the zoo made a deal for a black jag. Nobody's ever seen a white one before. Well, then wouldn't it make more sense to take her to a preserve that specializes in endangered species? I don't think so. I think this one's going to the highest bidder. Why don't you just fly his ass back? When he was in the service, he developed arteriovenous malformation in the left side of his brain. Any change in atmospheric pressure could cause it to rupture. He might not survive. Yeah, but we're not flying, so what are you doing here? He was in the Andes, now he's at sea level. It's not as severe an altitude change, but he still needs to be monitored. So unfortunately, a boat was our only option. So, you chose this beat-to-shit Mexican tramper at five in the morning. No offense, Leo. Hey, none taken. The Brazilians only gave us six hours to pick him up at the dock, otherwise he was going missing. Wow. I just spent ten months in the jungle, and this all smells like cat shit to me. Well, we're not only the ones who have to eat on this shit bucket. Goodnight. - Later. - Goodnight. He always like that? You never quite get used to it. Is she really a man-eater? Tigers and polar bears are the only animals that'll hunt down a man and eat 'em. Big, white. She's a jag. She's no man-eater. - He's smiling at me. - It's not a he. She's not smiling. It's a threat display. She's warning you not to mess with her baby. Or what? She'll tear the skin right off your body with her teeth, and rip the flesh right off your bones. How do you catch them? You know, watched them for a week. Got to know their habits. Built the blind. Dipped my darts in curare, took 'em with my blow pipe. What's curare? It's a paste made from plants, works like a drug. 30 seconds after the darts hit them, they go limp, fall into my net, paralyzed, but still conscious. - That's cheating. - Hey, it's not how you play the game, it's whether or not you win. How come that one's not in a cage? Well, you see, Rafi, I'm in this beat-to-shit bar on the edge of the jungle... people tell me that Aussie that owned the parrot died, and I make the mistake of feeding it, and now I can't get rid of the goddamn thing. Does he talk? - What's a cat say? - Meow. What time is it? Time to go. - What do you think of this? - Take him out. Take him out. He doesn't like guns. - He's smart. - Yeah... a regular Einstein. What's its name? I don't know. - You should name him. - Hell, no. As soon as you name it, it's yours for life. You don't like him much, do you? Not much. Do you like me? A little less than the parrot. Jerome! Uh... He got some of those assholes in cases. Killed one of them with a tire iron. Goddamn self-defense is what it was. But I've gotta find a white man in Jamaica - to believe him. Well... - Mm-mm. So, I hid him on the ship. Been together ever since. - To Scuddy. - Whoa. Damn straight. And my old man... a mechanic in Long Beach, California, tells me I'll never amount to a puddle of piss, because I didn't become a mechanic like him. Well, you can tell your old man to kiss your ass, Walsh. Well, now, he is visiting me in the new house I'm gonna buy on Pine Lake and watch... that's watch, not participate, we go fishing every day for the rest of my life. Except for the I don't feel like fishing, and then he can sit on my porch and look up at me on my hammock, and watch me drink 26-year-old Bourbon and smoke Cuban cigars, because, Scuddy... I have hit the motherload. - Wha-ha! - To the motherload! But did you see the musculature on that cat? Yeah, gosh, she's a beauty. Ah, what's up, Doc? Monitoring him every four hours. I worked at the San Diego Zoo. Great pandas. Who's your father? Henry Taylor. The Admiral? Didn't they name... a boat after him? Nuclear submarine, yeah. How, uh... How long were you in San Diego? Too long. I couldn't stand my boss. Ten years and eight zoos later, I started hunting and I became my own boss. Eight zoos in ten years. I'd say you have a problem with authority, Mr. Walsh. You know, I think Freed's in on Dr. Taylor. Can't blame him. Looks damn fine in that uniform. - I'd hit it. - Like I'm blind, Prettyboy? I'd hit that, too. Eat it up, Loffler. Come on, shovel it down. It's not like we're meeting at a 7-Eleven. Coast Guard won't be expecting us in San Juan at precisely 6:30. There's always a leeway. I don't give a shit what their team does. My team's gonna be exactly where it's supposed to be and exactly when it's supposed to be there. Right? You've been in my ship for two days, Mr. Ringer. And I must say... you're a difficult man to like. You don't have to like me, Morales. Hell, you don't even got to respect me. But for your safety, and the safety of everyone on board, you have to obey me until I get Loffler off this ship. Got it? What's wrong, Loffler? Hey, Loffler, quit fucking around, man. You want to give us a show? Polly want a cracker? Hey, Loffler, quit fucking around. Loffler! - Hey! - He's having a seizure. Call the doc. Call the doc. Dr. Taylor, Robert's having a seizure. I repeat, Robert's having a seizure. When did it start? Fifteen, 20 seconds ago. Is he breathing? Breathe, man, breathe. I can't tell. Get in the cage. Put a depressor in his mouth, don't let him choke, I'm on my way. Open the gate, Prettyman. I'm going in. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Lock it up behind me. Come on. Come on. - Breathe. - Open your mouth, man. His jaw's locked. - Loffler, open your mouth. - You got it. Come on. Open your goddamn mouth. Motherfucker, open your mouth! Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him! - Let him go. - Get the fucker! Open his mouth. Open your mouth. Motherfucker, let him go. What's happening? Miller? - Prettyman? - Please? Miller? Miller? Holy shit. One's a United States Marshall. The other's a government's attorney. We don't want them looking to make trouble just because they don't like you, Frank, which they don't. We don't want them asking unnecessary questions. We don't want them sticking their noses in my paperwork. Is he armed? Two-one-fours, two nine mils, extra clips. He's armed. And he's got a radio. So we start on Channel 9. Fifteen minutes, we go up two channels. Fifteen more, we go back three, two up, three back, every 15 minutes. Got it? - Copy. - Copy. Mr. Ringer... come to the radio room immediately. Government wants him alive. You're free to join us. - Is there another radio? - There's a handset. Not anymore. Loffler, he must have taken it. Can't call the Coast Guard without it. Is there any section of the ship we can seal off? Yeah. The upper train on the first hold. I want everybody in that hold in ten minutes. Mr. Freed, Dr. Taylor, Mr. Walsh, the crew. Morales, I want you in there with your son. Someone needs to steer the ship. It's just me. Barnett, I want you on the bridge with them, - restricted entry. - Sir. When everybody is safe, we're gonna turn this ship upside down. - Let's go. - I'm not going anywhere until I feed my animals. You'll go wherever I tell you. - I'm not... - Frank. ...going anywhere until I feed my animals. - Frank! - They haven't eaten in 12 hours. Frank, do they have any water? Sure, but who knows how long it's going to take this asshole to catch that asshole? This is my ship now, Walsh. And until Loffler is back in his cell, you'll plant yourself in the first hold, or I'll arrest you for mutiny. And any other damn thing I can dig up. Let's go, Morales. Harrison, take the cook to the galley. Lock yourselves inside, and get these people some food. Got it. You, come on, let's go. - Delgado? - Hmm? Okay. The man that we're looking for is a mercenary assassin. A professional killer. He's armed... and he's the most dangerous son of a bitch you'll ever get this close to. Now I'm responsible for all the lives in this hold. So, until the situation returns to normal, you'll stay right here. You'll be safe if you stay put. You better say it again in Spanish, Coach. I don't think the team is with you. Shut up, Walsh. How long will this take, Mr. Ringer? Not long. There's only so many places he can hide. Who said he's gonna hide? Wait, Delgado! Goddammit. Goddammit. Shit. Ringer? Ringer, come in. - Ringer, come in. - What the hell is it? There are monkeys, freaking monkeys in the galley. Shit. Freed. What's up? Walsh, your damn monkeys got out, they're in the galley. They didn't get out. Someone let them out. - Loffler. - Yeah, no shit. Mr. Freed, no one else leaves this hold. Walsh, I move, you move. You're my fucking shadow. Give it to me. Harrison, this is Walsh. Are there any babies in there? Tell him not to touch the babies. Over here. I need this opened now! - Find the lock. - Shelton, - get on this side. - Delgado! Come on! Open. Delgado! There must be a switch or something. - There's nothing. - Come on, guys! Make a hole! God damn it. Walsh, I gave you a direct order. I don't take orders, Ringer. Not since the Army. Where'd you serve, Frank? Loffler, this is Ringer. Come on, Frank, tell me, where you'd serve? Loffler. 82nd Airborne, Fort Bragg. Shut the hell up, Walsh. - Get off the damn radio. - You a pilot? - Mechanic. - How long? Four years, in and out. I made a career of it. They trained me to kill. That's what I did. Then one day, they just said, "Your business in South America has concluded." "This is not business. This is personal." They said, "Now that's an order. Now you be a good soldier, you come home." You know what, Frank? I'm not a good soldier. So what do you say, Frank? You still up for Shuffleboard? I'd sure love to buddy up with you, pal. Loffler, dammit. Maybe later, asshole. Everybody change channels. Mr. Scuddy. Mr. Scuddy. Scuddy? I'm still here, Ringer. Another goddamn problem. These engines won't run themselves. I don't get down there soon, this goddamn ship's gonna stop in the middle of the goddamn ocean. We're meeting Coast Guard, rendezvous in San Juan. Go keep those engines running. Take a radio, Scuddy, and switch channels. Harrison will meet you there. Okay. We'll start at the deck house, me and Vasquez will move out. - Yes, sir. - Forrest, you and Shelton move forward. I want Loffler alive, gentlemen. - And watch your backs. - Let's move. Huh? Jesus fucking Christ. Scuddy, you there? What do you want, Walsh? Loffler let most of the animals out. He took two of the snakes. I bagged them, and the bags are gone. If he lets them loose, they'll find the hottest, most humid place. How many are there? I just told you, two of them. Well, we see 'em, - we'll get 'em for you. - No, no. If you see them, you call me. You don't go anywhere near them. You tell Jerome, don't go anywhere near the snakes. They're venomous as hell. And you brought the anti-venom, - of course. - Yeah, I would have, Doc, except the pharmacy was closed. Do you have any idea how irresponsible it is to put our lives at risk? Be sure and mention that - to Loffler when I see him. - It's not what I mean. You know what? People like you, I never know what you mean. What about the cat, Walsh? We got to catch him before he gets to the tapirs. I assume he likes to eat them. Yes, she likes to eat them. They're her goddamn favorite food. How're you gonna catch her, Walsh? I put a tracking collar on her. Will it work on the ship? I don't know. It's the first time I've used it. It works. Walsh, out. Ringer, pick up. Where the hell are you, Walsh? And where's the cat? I just saw her on the deck house. Now listen to me, there's no water on this ship. What? I said, there's no water anywhere on this ship. Are you sure? I know how a fucking faucet works, you federal clown. Morales, where are the water faucets? Near the engine room. - Meet me there. Be damn careful. - Got it. Rafi... you stay with Dr. Taylor, okay? Rafi. Mm-mm. Excuse me, sir. Are you the engineer? There's the goddamn Merchant Marines. So, you served, huh? Hell, yeah... I served. Hauled cargo, troops ten thousand miles across the Pacific to Vietnam. - Wow! - Damn right, I served. Hmm. Who are you? Well, Prettyman. He sent you instead of Harrison? No. No. - Well, Loffler ain't here. - Yeah. Yeah. So, sir, are we still on course here? - Damn straight. - Good. Drop that asshole and you sons of bitches on a dock in Puerto Rico, and then we push off to Mexico. So, you run all of these engines all by yourself? Well, me and Jerome. Jerome. Yeah, Jerome, step up. Let's meet Jerome. Hey, Jerome. - Yeah. - So tell me, is there a backup fridge on this old freighter? Oh, yeah. Steering gear room. The bottom of this ship all the way out. Thanks. What the hell would that have to do with you, and... - Scuddy! - What? Scuddy, where are you? Switchgear panel. - Where the hell did he go? - Who? - Prettyman, he was just here. - Prettyman's dead. There's no water anywhere on the ship. - No drinking water. - Bullshit! I filled the tanks myself. I checked them. Come on. Shit. Jesus, oh, man. My God. Can you fix them? There's nothing left of the damn things. Shit. Jerome, fill every bottle you can find, and... Oh! Jesus. Help me, God. Walsh, one of your snakes just bit Morales. Walsh, come in. Walsh! Attack! Ah, fuck! Christ, Shelton, stay with me, man. Oh, Jesus. - Which way did it go? - He went out the door. He went out the door! Shelton, it's okay, man. Shelton, stay with me, buddy. It's okay. I'm with you. It's okay. Freed, open the damn door. - Okay, Freed. - Guys, in here. Hold pressure on that leg. All right, guys, move him over here. I've got a table. Rafi, get a life vest. Loffler. Was it Loffler? - Goddamn. - Right here. - Alright, guys, over there. - Mr. Ringer, is Loffler still alive? This guy's killed three of my men. Fuck taking him alive. You take this sick motherfucker, give him the best military training money can buy. Turn him loose on the general population. You think he could just yank his leash, and bring him back? Our tax dollars at work, you federal retards. I can help, Mr. Ringer. I can help. I'm in the National Guard back home. Let me help. Could you kill someone, Freed, huh? Line him up in your scope, pull the trigger? Because from now on, we shoot Loffler on sight. You're with Forrest. Vasquez, you're with me. Watch each other's backs. And if you see Loffler, put a bullet in him. Let's go. And the same goes for the cat. You hear me, Walsh? - Your cat is dead. - You kill my cat, - I'll blow your head off. - Oh, son of a bitch. Tranquilo, okay? Okay, look at me. Tranquilo. You stay with your papi, okay? - What type of snake? - It's a bushmaster. It's a hemolytic venom, uh, affects the blood in the organs. 200,000 minus points. Serious tissue damage. Uh... He needs medication. Have you got any IV fluids or... or morphine? In my cabin. Okay. I'll be right back. - My... my cabin's this way. - Hundred grand is that way. - What about Morales? - He's a dead man. - He needs medication. - I said that for Rafi. Even with the anti-venom, he'd only have a 20 percent chance. We have to try. I'm not asking you to be a saint, just a good man. Let's get something nice and sparkling clear. If there is a good man out there somewhere, it's not me. I don't have a problem with that, okay? Are you coming or not? You know what my father would say? He'd say, "Mr. Walsh, you're worse than an animal, not worth saving." Ha-ha! - You got any brothers? - Only child. I'm sure you're the perfect son. I'm positive you weren't. Thanks. Freed, Forrest, anything? Nothing yet. Barnett? All clear. Rafi. Okay, bye. Rafi. What the hell? What's wrong? The goddamn ship's turning around. Ringer! Ringer! What do you want, Scuddy? Somebody's turned the goddamn ship around. How in the hell would you know that? I've been at sea 60 years, you shit-for-brains moron. Barnett? Barnett? Ringer, don't get port side. Lifeboat's missing. Check in the brigs, then I'm on my way. Barnett, come in! Rafi, wait. Where you're going? Rafi, come back! Take him out. Hey. Take him out. It's holstered, Einstein. You want to drink or not? Uh-oh. - Time for Shuffleboard, Frank? - I hate Shuffleboard. Yeah, me too. Doing a little homework? Hmm, little geography. Come on, Frank, it's due tomorrow. You're gonna have to blame the dog. Now move your ass back into that hole. Move. Got a real nice cage for you. That's it. Keep going. Go. So, where're we going, hmm? Keep going. Keep moving back. There you go. Come on. Go. Go on, that's your cage back there. Frank, my father. Rafi, go back to the safe... ah! Back up. Back up. Frank. She's beautiful, Frank. Must be worth a small fortune. - Don't speak. - I know I'm stating the obvious here, but um... you only have one dart. Frank, I'm scared. Don't move. - Shoot the cat, Frank. - Frank. Shh. There's no time to think. Shoot the cat. - You all right? - Yeah, thanks. Come on. Loffler destroyed the bridge. Barnett and the first man are dead, - and we're missing a lifeboat. - Had to be him. No, it had to be somebody else. We just saw Loffler below deck. It was a coup. They wanted me to go with them. - Scuddy? - What do you want, Ringer? Is there another way to steer this thing? Steering gear room bottom of the ship. Loffler asked the same question. Damn it. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? You just had to trap us all here. No one else is leaving this ship. Now take that kid back to the safe hold. Come on, Rafi, let's get away from these clowns. Forrest, you, and Freed find Loffler. What are you gonna do? Turn this boat back around. Come on, Freed. Loffler, goddammit. - How're we going? - It doesn't matter. Got to make sure this motherfucker's dead by the time we get there. Is there any other way off the ship? In the Switlik, inflatable lifeboat. - Where? - It's in a bedroom, somewhere in the deckhouse. Are you going to help us get off this ship or not? White jag comes along once in a lifetime, if it ever does. You find the Switlik, you can come back for it later. No, I can't. Even if Loffler doesn't kill it, I don't have permits for any of these animals. You smuggle them out of the country illegally? Ugh, you are a first-class prick. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm worse than an animal, not worth saving. - Oh no, no, trust me. - Blah, blah, blah. There is nothing about you worth saving. You're arrogant, selfish, disrespectful, dishonest, everything I was taught and trained not to be. - You make me... - I make your heart beat. You're delusional. Only guy you can't take home to the Admiral. Where are you going? The Switlik. The thing's huge. I'll have to get Jerome to help me. How do we know you'll come back for us? You don't. He'll come back. Lock the door. Keep an eye out for that Sasquatch motherfucker. I'll split off that way. Let me know if you find him. Where's my navigation chart, Frank? You see? When you enjoy this much, it's not business, Frank. It's personal. Walsh? Walsh, come in. Ringer? Freed? Are you there? Ooh. What have you done? I need you alive. Let's chat about it. Walsh, are you there? Freed? Someone? They could all be dead. Just us and Loffler now. Need the Coast Guard. And that name we all run from... Not for long. Uh-oh! Where's my navigation chart, Frank? - Going somewhere? - Yeah. Granada. I'm going to jump in that lifeboat, and I'm just gonna disappear. - Mm-hmm. - Good luck with that. Not anymore, Frank, I don't need luck. But I do need... what I need... is my chart. Well, where is it, Frank, hmm? Where is it? Where is it? A few degrees off and you'll end up in the US Virgin Islands, fucker. Where is my chart? We're going around in circles till the Coast Guard catches you. I will kill you, Frank. You can't kill me, asshole. You know, Frank... ...those are some beautiful birds you got there. What do you get for them, huh? Stop it. - Fuck! Shit, Loffler! - Where's my chart, Frank? Fuck! Stop it, goddamn you. When I run out of birds, I'm just gonna shoot the boyfriend. No. All right. All right. It's in my cabin, third room on the bell side. You do have a heart, Frank. Good to know. It better be where you say it is. It's there. Shit. How long to turn them back on? Prettyman. I had a feeling - you might show up. - How long? Well, I gotta crack the lines and bleed the air out. That's about 45 minutes per diesel. Then I got to change the filters. Refill the tanks. That's about 30 minutes per. - I got to crank them over, and... - I'm pretty sure you could do it faster than that, huh? What do you think? Come on, Jerome! Fuck him up! Scuddy, run! Come on. Come on, Jerome! Go! Walsh? Freed? You okay? I heard gunshots. Please get me out. Where's Loffler? What the hell happened here? - Just get me the fuck out. - Yeah. It's locked. Shoot the damn thing. Don't you watch TV? Walsh, come on. Loffler's not gonna wait. He'll die if we leave him here. He'll die if we take him. We'll all die if we don't stop talking about it. You have to tell Rafi. How're you doing? We have to go. You too, pal. I know. You want to just... take a minute and say goodbye to him? Walsh. I'll take that. All right, let's go and get that lifeboat. Rafi. Rafi. Rafi. Nice. Rafi, grab a lifejacket. - Oh, shit! - Run, Rafi! I lost the gun. Hey! Who shot the lifeboat? But my bet is, it's Ringer. Am I right? Hey, Frank, thank you for finding the Switlik, I appreciate that. Come on, get the gun. He's got Rafi. That's it. Now, this goes without saying, but if anybody shoots at me while I'm in the Switlik, I'm gonna put a bullet in this little boy's head. - Do you understand that? - Do something! - All right. - Hey, Paul! Paul, where are you? - Stay down. - Okay. Come on, we got to have a little chat. Wait. Wait, just give me a second. Let the kid go. I'll give you half the white cat. No. You know what? I'll keep the boy. And, just gonna kill you too. Ellen, run! Stay with us! All right, come on. Hurry! Come here. Come here. Shit. Come on. What the hell are we doing here? He's got Rafi. What are we doing here? All right. I need you to tell me something right now. What the hell is going on with Freed? - Freed? - Yeah. I met him at the airport. I have no idea what the hell he's up to. No. Oh, what, you're doubting me? I need you to stay here, pal. Lock the door. Don't open it for anyone. Now where the hell are you going? - I'm going hunting. - About goddamn time. - Now you can lock it. - What are you doing? I wanna help. You can be the bait. Bait? Draw Loffler out, so I get a clean shot. Go downstairs, make some noise, he'll find you. Can you do it or not? - How will I know where you are? - You won't. You'll have to trust that I'll be there when the time comes. You have to trust me. - Walsh, I... - Jesus, Ellen, just call me Frank. Tell me you're a good man, Frank. No, I'm no good. But I can hunt. This is United States Supervising Deputy Marshal John Ringer of the Mimer calling the Coast Guard. This is Deputy Marshall Ringer, do you copy? Over. Stop moving. This is Supervising Deputy Marshal John Ringer of the Mimer calling the Coast Guard. Do you copy? Mimer, this is the Coast Guard cutter Valiant. We're on our way to meet you in San Juan. What is your status? Our ship is disabled. Our prisoner is dead. And we've suffered all kinds of casualties here, and are in need of immediate medical assistance. What is your position? 14 degrees, 20 minutes north. 68 degrees, 55 minutes west. We don't have you on our screens, Mimer. What is your location? 16 degrees, 31 minutes north. 66 degrees, 43 minutes west. We are three hours and 45 minutes north northwest of you. Can you send a chopper? Affirmative. Cheetah will saddle up and arrive at the Mimer in one hour. Repeat, Cheetah will arrive in one hour. Roger that. I'll be waiting. Oh... Valiant, could you please send some food and some water and throw it on that chopper? Our galley's been compromised, and, uh, we are all kinds of hungry down here. Will do, Mimer. Ringer, out. I told you to stop moving. Oh, we had a date. Drinks in the Polo Lounge, if I'm not mistaken? Come here. All right, open it. That's it. Frank didn't send you down here by yourself. You tell me where he is, or I'll kill you right now. Right behind you, motherfucker. Don't do it, Walsh. Freed, what the fuck? Ease back on the string. Loffler puts the gun down first. Can't do that, Frank. - You shoot, and I'll kill her. - Shoot him. Ease back, Walsh. Do it now. Fuck you, Freed. You move, Loffler's dead. Yeah. And then he'll kill you and I'll kill Ellen. And then I'll cover up all his tracks. He's NSA, Frank. Put the bow down. He had me fooled too, Frank, till I saw him kill Forrest. The NSA is in bed with some pretty bad people, - Frank. - He's lying. He'll be arrested when he gets home. You said he was already arrested. He is. He'll be convicted of treason and murder, and punished to the full extent of the law. And they'll de-program me and then they'll kill me. He belongs to the United States government. Not anymore. I went to South America to assassinate people for the NSA. And I ended up moonlighting for the President of Peru and the drug cartels. He's lying. I got deep intel on all of them, Frank. I could tie them all together. Ease back, Walsh, do it now. And how's the tension on that bow, Frank? - It's got to be something. - Put it down, Walsh. - Frank, no. - Ready to die? Because he's a lot more dangerous than I am. - Give me the bow. - It's only - a matter of time... - Walsh! ...before everybody dies. - Shoot! - Ah! Ah! Don't move. Come here. Pull it out. Move. Frank, are you listening? I got your friends down here. - They're alive. - Frank! As long as you cooperate, they'll stay that way. All right, Frank. What do you want? Let's get on with it, buddy, huh? Just come down to the engine room and then maybe I'll let uh, Rafi and Ellen live, but you've got to die. I got a better idea. What's that? You come here, and I'll kick your fucking ass. All right, Frank. Where are you? You know, I really hate goodbyes, Ellen. I really, really do. But... I got you a little gift, hmm? And this is just gonna help you remember what could have been. Hmm? Enjoy. No! Guess who's here, Frank? Let's not drag this out. My ride's almost here. Still alive, Frank? Because I'd really love to kick your ass. What was on the dart, Frank? Curare. Doesn't seem to be working. Huh? All right. Come on, Frankie boy. Oh, no, no, no. That's the curare. I know, that's how it works. Come on, you got to hit a little harder than that, pussy. Is that all you got? I can't seem to feel my legs. I can't seem to give a shit. Hey! Listen, you want to... you want to know... you want to know what I just love about curare? Even though you can't move, you'll... you'll still be conscious. You'll still be aware. And that's important... because... you're about to enjoy dinner with a friend of mine. And I would appreciate it if you were nice to her. Frank, I stole a lot of money. How much do you want? No, Loffler, this isn't business. - It's personal. - Frank! Frank! Frank. Frank! No, don't! Don't move. Don't move. Okay. Stay still. Thank you. Rafi. Thanks, man, for saving Rafi. It was the least I could do, Leo. I left you for dead. Rafi, take care of your old man. Careful with that wrench, son. Don't strip the dreads, got enough goddamn diesel everywhere as it is. Flip that generator switch. Goddamned sailboat. They're gonna send me Loffler's dental records. There's no other way to identify him. Dangerous cat you've got there, Mr. Walsh. She... uh... She's a real man-eater. I'm gonna need to see the paperwork on all of your animals. Well... Captain. Loffler destroyed all of Mr. Walsh's paperwork. It was on the bridge. I saw it, everything's in order. Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll be sure to put that in my report. Thank you, Captain. We contacted the shipping company. They're gonna send another crew to meet you in San Juan, and take the Mimer to Mexico. Well, I'd really, really like to go with them if possible, and close my deals. I hope you have a better trip this time. Thank you. - Lieutenant. - Captain. That was a very dishonest thing to do, Ellen. Oh, I make your heart beat, Frank. You're everything I was taught not to be. If you're ever in Adelphi, uh... maybe I could save you from a psychotic killer. So, what will happen to her now, the cat? I mean... There's a breeding ranch in Kenya, and they've had some pretty good luck with rare cats. Congratulations. I'm sure you'll be well-paid. They don't have any money. Oh. You better be careful. Why? You might just be a good man after all. They've got a zoo in Adelphi. You wanna live in Adelphi, Einstein? I know. Yes, it is.
