That's crazy! Is she even human? What did she eat growing up to end up like that? Her body would be like this. - Be quiet! - She's just born different. - That's right! - I said, be quiet! When life is this unfair, what's the point of studying? - That's right. - Stop! Hey, Kang Joo Eun. Someone wrote your name at the school entrance. Ah seriously... I love you Don't they know you're supposed to write it in pencil? Listen up. Erase them. You delinquents over there. - What? - Quit smoking or you won't get any taller. Tall— Even if you get taller, quit smoking. You might keep growing. - What are you? - The famous daughter, Daegu's Venus. Look at you. - Pick it up. - Hey. Since everyone likes you, you can't see straight? (conceited) What can't I see straight? I can see this well! Kang Joo Eun. That's right. I'm Kang Joo Eun. So what?

Thank you, Venus. Wonderful, beautiful, fantastic! Your mom gave birth to you so you could become Miss Korea. No. My mom says I should just study. No, no, no! Your face is not made for studying. So, I am very busy right now. Oh. Miss Kang Joo Eun. Wouldn't you like to change your life? I have no special complaints about my life. And... straight hair suits me better. Then. Oh...Oh my God! I'm sure she's Miss Korea. What will you become otherwise? Lawyer! I can become one! You can't study well this way. Here. Thanks. You have your finals soon, right? You can just look at this. Oppa. Because of me, you keep studying just the basics. Oh? Joo Eun, no. I think the basics is what studying is all about. When you're working this hard to get into law school, what else is there we can do for you except this? Joo Eun, I've written out everything to help you with your English. I wish I could do it for you. Silence. Your dream is to become a lawyer, and you went to Jooan Elementary School, Middle School, and now you're in your second year of Jooan High School, Kang Joo Eun? That's right. I'm Kang Joo Eun. Why? - You know me, right? - Should I? Are you famous? Are you in a textbook? So far, I'm only at the mid-Joseon era. Whereabouts do you appear? I'm in the papers. I attend a nearby sports high school. At least, I'm a member of the national swimming team, and recently, I took part in the world competition of young swimmers as a national representative. - No, I'm on my way back from it! - Oh, I am so sorry. I should have had a bouquet of flowers ready for you. - I came from Seoul. - Don't lie. The recent swimming competition was held in France— Not that... I thought your wish was to speak with a Seoul dialect... I was scouted from Seoul and came here. By any chance...did you read the Ceci magazine? Only little girls read that! Your dimples are pretty. Oh, if someone heard you, they'll think you're flirting with me. I don't know very well but it's probably something I can only say just once. Since there's only one first love for a man. 1999 FINA World Youth Athletic Championships Kang Joo Eun, from now on you're my first love. Using a Seoul dialect is not very easy. It's probably as hard as becoming a lawyer. No. I can do anything if I set my mind to it. I'm Kang Joo Eun. Then why don't you set your mind to me too? 1999 → 2014, Seoul It was true. I was Kang Joo Eun who could accomplish anything I set my mind to. You came? - Hyun Jeong, please bring some tea. - Yes. Have a seat. I thought that if I became a lawyer, my life and world peace would be guaranteed, but it was all lies. Life gets worse and worse, and it's true that dreams can come true. That fact is true but... I could be left with no clothes to fit me. That is the reality. This is the swimmer, right? But who is this woman next to him? It's true he's a swimmer. His name is Im Woo Sik and a boyfriend of 15 years as well as my first love. The woman next to him is... me! Isn't that putting one's neck into the nose? It's putting one's neck into the noose. Why is she blaming me when she asked for it? What in the world lasts forever? It's natural for love and woman to decay over time. Man are all the same, right? They like it if it's pretty and like it even more when it's young and pretty. Isn't that so? Well, it's true there's a higher chance. Is she amateur? Who leaves the evidence on their love affairs? She just got pissed off since she's getting a divorce with all the excuses. If that's the case, it looks like you're taking all the blame. That's what I'm saying! Oh! Is the adultery law being abolished? It's not like I have some guilty feelings or anything. I'm not an Assemblyman, so... She eventually lost her husband to a glamorous woman and couldn't even get alimony. She should've got a more expensive lawyer. - So.. - Yes, That glamorous woman is me. That ex-wife accused me so I'm going to sue her back. For false accusation. Damaging my reputation, insulting, spreading false information, violating human rights... Violating privacy! Put whatever is possible. Settlements? Never, absolutely never! I'll call you after reviewing the files. But then, the other side also seem to feel wronged so... How about thinking about it once more-- It seems, you got me all wrong. I'm not the person to rethink about it. You have to win unconditionally. When you eat a lot of candy, it's a major sign of stress. I guess you didn't know. But, it releases the stress... What do you mean, you get stressed a lot by gaining weight. The flowers have wilted. It hasn't... died off yet. Give it some water. I seriously almost hit her! Karma, poetic justice, what are they even doing? The person who had an affair with that young glamorous woman is our CEO's "friend." Hyeon Jung, does a lawyer really have to go this far? You're doing it because you're a lawyer. Don't you know his motto? That's right! How can a lawyer not know when her secretary knows? CEO. If you want to gossip about it, you should at least do a good job in maintaining security. It's not that. I think Kim Mi Jin's case is a bit unjustifiable. Oh, unjustifiable? Unjustifiable! Unjustifiable again? What is this being utterly unreasonable in the law firm? This unjustifiable, that unjustifiable. You always go on with that conscience and right duty. Oh my, look here Lawyer Kang. If that conscience and right duty always are applied, we'll all be starving and die! It's not just about conscience and right duty.We're still lawyers. How can we do unfair harm to an innocent person? Oh-ho, this girl, really. It's illegal to choose customers to be on the taxi. A lawyer is a legal law service job. I frequently told you that. Your dream and hope? Attain it with your own money. Don't try to get them while getting salaries from others. Finish this matter as a priority! CEO. Excuse me, CEO. Lawyer. You said you still have 14 months worth of loans! "Do you know why the past is important to us?" "It's because past is the lesson for today." Wow.2012 Even who looks at this, Moving the desk on purpose. If you want to start your own, you can tell me always. I will send you a big flower pot. 2014LA Hollywood's biggest troublemaker, Anna Sue. Yet another scandal. The girl is crazy. She has some problems. Yes, definitely. Well let's talk about this as we go through this paparazzi... Very young kid, now star of the Stella Show Before Jennifer Anderson met trainer John Kim, she was almost hopeless. But he turned her into a queen of queens, and sent a hopeful message to women all over the world. The very John Kim, this hero of the Stella Show, is now engulfed in a scandal. Person on the other end? It's Anna Sue, Hollywood's infamous troublemaker with a merciless tongue and problems with MJ. Sources say John Kim is an Asian man in his thirties, and that's all we know. You know I'm really hoping for the couple John Kim He's such a great guy, and, you know, we all want to root for his relationship. Shame on Anna Sue... Timing and Subtitles brought to you by Minion's Rising Team @ Viki. Anna Sue Anna Sue It's something I found out after becoming a lawyer. Lawyers' work is usually something like this. With this case, a plaintiff's deputy starts a defending speech like this. It starts with "I". For example, "Do you think I haven't tried going on a diet?" Something like this? I even followed some power blogger's method by eating only banana, lettuce, tofu. Alias, One Food. It was excessive and there was side effect. This one actress' method, who is famous for overall beauty? Do you have raspberry tea? We don't. Pass. So you don't. This one glamorous sexy celebrity's method. Relaxing lower-body bathing and full bathing each day. And of course, the standard method that everyone knows. Constant exercise and a sufficient amount of sleep. Sufficient amount of sleep. Also more importantly a stress-free and positive heart. Yes. Please continue. "You can just blab all you want, it's none of my business"? Is that what it is? No... It's not that... Anyway, when diet becomes pointless, Unfortunately, this yo-yo effect comes with it. This annoying yo-yo ruins everything. Joo Eun &amp; Woo Sik15 Years Anniversary ♥ My Woo Sik ♥ Where are you?

Whenever I mention your weight and success you always bringing up glamorous style. Bad natured kids will misunderstand that a divorcee is jealous. A divorcee that runs a business of a debt ridden spinster? What kind of world is it these days that... This is that day that the debt ridden spinster gets proposed to. - Stop spoiling my good day and hang up. - Don't like it too much! I don't know if it's because you've gained weight but your heart has gotten bigger too. You're so emotional. Oh, hang up the phone. Anyway, you're just getting what you're supposed to get so don't overdo it, okay? Oh no. What do I do? It seems to have fallen. - Use mine. - Excuse me? Oh, no. It seems like a new one. I have many.

Why is your heart over here? I'm really sorry that it happened this way, Joo Eun. So I'm asking why your heart is over here? - What used to be on your finger... - Joo Eun. What exactly is this? I seem too much like a rat bastard. That's why. That's why. So if you gave me wine and a flower bouquet you would seem less like a rat bastard? Don't fool around and hurry up and give over the ring. Just accept my heart that wanted to take care of our 15th Anniversary. - I'm sorry Joo Eun. - What is this guy saying, Im Wook Sik? Are you crazy? Are you mad? Why is "I'm sorry" coming out at the timing of marriage. Joo Eun. - Let's... - Shut up. - Joo Eun, I- - I understand so shut up. - What do you understand?! - The meaning of this ring. And with what feeling you're returning this ring. With the you at the time when you were giving me this ring, and the you who is returning this ring, I know how different you are. I understand. But Woo Sik I'm too tired tonight so let's do it all later. - Hey, hey, Kang Joo Eun. - Oh, please!

Would you give up on life, could you give up on life just because you had a bitter taste of failure? Would you give up on life as a woman just because you're fat or you aged? Ladies and gentlemen. Today, I'd like to introduce to you today a woman who is reborn. She is Forget the past. She is not the woman who failed in marriage or wrecked her life with drugs and alcohol. Now I give you the reborn queen of queens. Jennifer Anderson. Who could have made this possible? In truth, John Kim made Jennifer and he completed her. She's really beautiful. Jennifer. John Kim, who was able to help her rediscover her lost past and smile. This is everything we know about the John Kim. The John Kim whose face we don't even know. Why are we going wild on that man? Who could he possibly be? One. One, two. Raise the leg. Relax your shoulders. You're doing well. Fight! One, two. Come. Yes, Hyeon Woo. Hello? Are you Joo Eun? You have time, right? At the practice area... I must be crazy. You slept, right? - If you're taking the plane, get me some eye cream at the cosmetic store. - HANG UP! Eye cream! Not ice cream. That's what you like. Hello? Joo Eun. I wonder how the proposal went... Is that why she slept until late? Please go on a trip to America. Just over the weekend. I'm coming! I'm here! Hyung! Yeah. I'm getting washed. Yes. Hyung Yeong Ho, the steak is burning. -- Turn it over. It's over. Akira got a lot better. Hyung! The sweet potatoes are burning. - Flip it. - Flip it. - What time is it? - It's the night plane. Oh my God! "Anna Sue not denying nor admitting to the scandal." Dating rumors? What?! John Kim?! Really, WHO is he? What should we do, Hyung? Wow. The visual is totally perfect. You really suit each other. This is a big deal. If Koreans found out about this... They just do what they want. The one with the long tail is the one at fault, not the one who stepped on it. What are you thinking of doing? Let me think about why it's darker under the lamp. (People don`t realize what's right under their nose) Anyway, tomorrow's work is for tomorrow. No. No. No. It's not work. It's scandal. You little... Hello? Yeah. Korean Snake manager right here... What about our luggage? I sent them off already, and packed what needs to be carried. You were always this way... Be careful of your body. You opened wide the gate of hell, and you're worrying about others? Right. You're not young anymore, and your opponent is very young. You know that, right? You're not going to come before the match? As a sponsor and a coach, I pampered and raised you to be a champion. You look like you have a complaint. I'm acting cute. Come on, let's fight. Manager Min Yes, Manager Min. What? I'm doing fine. Yes, then. He called to check up on me, but I feel uneasy. Did the Korean elders find out? If so, he would've chased the people out or he would've been chased. If you try to act cute, you're dead. Do they think America is like Gyeonggido? So they told you to come as soon as you arrived? Wow, your boss is really something. My stomach has been hurting. Did I get indigestion? Oh, that's good. If your stomach doesn't feel well, you'll lose weight. That has some effect. My stomach feels bubbly. It really hurts. It's better than your body being weak. It's fine! I'm glamorous. Then just live in America, then. It's full of glamor types everywhere. Oh yeah! What happened with Woo Sik? Did he give you the ring? How is it? He gave me something very expensive. Let's talk about when I go back. Miss Lawyer. Should I go get you? No thanks. I won't forget your eye cream, Min Joon's dermatitis lotion, and Min Joon's grandma's scarf. I'm hanging up. You're in America, right? Give me a call when you get back. Did Min Joon's field trip go well? You should have sent me some pictures. The field trip is next week. My ex-wife has a lot of interest in her ex-husband. Of course, since that's where the child support comes from. Does my ex-wife know John Kim? Korea is an internet savvy nation. The customers are even saying stuff. As expected, bringing up the issues that draw in the public. That's a producer's instinct. That calls for a hundred exclamation marks. Sheesh, look at that! "Just who is he, what is the truth?" They have the drive but no facts. News these days has no impact either. I'm going. Just deposit it automatically. Do you think divorce is something to brag about, that you would carry the child support around? Do you think child support is a bill? The champion there was an orphan!! Korean Snake! Let's go! Who would see you as a Harvard student? I always wear this Harvard shirt though. Exactly. You should put it in the trunk. No! The airplane is cold. I'm hungry. Eat something on the way. Thank you. Hey ma'am. We are people who had to meet by fate. - Excuse me?- Destiny. Oh, nice face. Thank you. Omo, omo. It's okay. I'm a gentleman. I feel so bad towards your traveling companion. This is an expensive seat... It's nothing. Travel comfortably. Thank you so much. Oh, you scared me. Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop! Winner! Korean Steak? No! Korean Snake. Jang Joon Seong. He's a total champion. - Ah, Korean Snake.- Yeah. Are you a professional athlete? I'm manager and trainer. It's a little weird for me to say it myself, but I'm a bit famous. When are you coming? I need to see you. You're in America, right? Call me when you get back. Excuse me, I'm sorry, but can I have one more blanket? Yes, I'll prepare it for you. Wear this. Ah, I'm okay. I'm also okay. Here. Okay, just for a bit. You... You look really cute in the fur. We are flying through a turbulent area. Since there is a lot of turbulence, please stay in your seats and fasten your seat belts. This is your captain speaking. Our flight is now... - Are you okay?- Yes. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. Right now, there is an emergency patient. If there are any passengers in the medical field, please notify the flight attendants. Announcement to all passengers. We have an emergency. I was going to surprise him. - Oh, Hyung!- If you're surprised, then it's fine. You can't take off your seatbelt. Right now, the airplane body is- Where is the patient? Why Korea, all of a sudden? It's the last place they'll search. Ma'am! Ma'am, come to your senses! - Ma'am!- Ji Woong. Hyung, how are you here? Did you see her eat anything? - She didn't eat anything. Just coffee and some medicine.- What kind of medicine? It hurts. - Hyung, how did you get here?- Hurry. Okay, okay, okay. Coffee, some medication that I don't know the name of, and wine. I-I-I don't know. Save our Ma'am. What should we do? An emergency... And some IV solution and a hot pack too— No, bring whatever you have. Yes. This ahjumma... Does she have a bag? Here it is. Ah, it hurts! Save me. Please save me. We need to move her, but her size is not easy to handle. A stretcher... - Joon Seong.- Should I carry her on my back? That's dangerous, you'll throw your back out. It's better to lift her. - Now. At the count of three.- Okay. One, two, three. Hold on. Again. Hold on. One, two. - You can't come in here. I apologize.- What? Hyung! Fighting! Take good care of Ma'am! - For now, put your seatbelt on.- Okay. If you need me. I did inform the Captain that there was a medical emergency situation. - Please stand and hold up a blanket.- Excuse me? - I need to take her clothes off.- Ah, yes. Since I'm in a bit of a hurry. What is this? Ah, I'm going to have to spank it a bit. Ah, this won't do. This is going to sting. Please hold this. - Joon Seong.- Yes? The left side. It looks like she's in shock. She's too cold. Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Minion's Rising Team @ Viki Who are you? Where am I? Probably somewhere in the middle of the atmosphere. It's obviously not heaven. Who... who did this to me? Your "thank you" sounds perfunctory to me. Excuse me, but can the person who put this in please take it out? How long should I keep pressing down on it? Excuse me, but what should I do if it keeps bleeding? Different than how you look, you really value your body. Oh, hey. Just stay put. You're probably not wearing much, since I ripped it all off. What? Pardon me, but I'm really curious. Why did you do it? What do you mean? You were drinking on the flight. You took caffeine and sleeping pills. Ah, that... Diet pills with unclear ingredients, and even an abdominal support belt. Oh my, why are you doing that with another person's body? I mean, you even went through another person's bag. - Isn't that a bit impolite on a first meeting?- Shhhhh... Do you realize the reason you're laying in first class is because of an in-flight emergency situation? I did look in your bag since you weren't able to respond, but since it's our first time meeting, I did think it was rude— I didn't expect that. I'm not saying that I'm not grateful. Should I just open the door and go out? By chance, did I save a person that wanted to die? What did you say? If not, then why would you do that to your body? On an empty stomach, at that, and on an airplane. I mean, would a person who wanted to die take pills with unclear ingredients to lose weight? - Look here, Ahjumma.- Omo, omo, omo. You seem like a single lady, but if you want to lose weight, sweat it out. Don't needlessly starve yourself and take weird pills, or use abdominal support belts. Excuse me, I'm thankful that you saved me, but I don't want to reveal my private life. Since you're the first woman whose clothes I took off 5 minutes after meeting, I felt too comfortable. I acknowledge that. I folded the abdominal support belt nicely and put it in your bag. Oh my, I'm so grateful. I shouldn't file a claim for damages. Since you saved me. And one more thing, it's not an abdominal support belt, but a corset. It's just that I've never ripped anything like that before. I'm sorry. Don't mention it. I want to repay your kindness, but it would be really nice if I could do it without looking at your face. Excuse me. Excuse me. If you really feel like that, there is a way. What is it? What do you mean, he hasn't come out? What happened? We were contacted not long ago, but we did double check the list of passengers that boarded the plane. If not here, then where would a passenger that boarded the plane come out from? Yes, Chairman. No, I'm certain that he arrived. I'll contact you after I look into it. Seoul One Heart Hospital to the Emergency Room. I should have just opened the airplane door and left earlier. I don't know well but it's probably something I won't be able to say twice because there's only one first love for a man. You're in the U.S., right? Make sure to call me when you get back. Make sure to call me when you get back. When are you coming? I need to see you. When are you coming? I need to see you. From today onward you're my first love. Your baggage? It didn't come from the airport. Oh! Oh! Patient! See you later. I know it's rude but it's because I'm really curious. Who are you talking to? Excuse me! By chance, do you have any thoughts of returning to the hospital? Get in then. Want me to get out and open the door? I think that I might be safer than this roadway. Enter your address and secure your seat belt. Ah. Your voice guided directions will commence...for your safety... I thought a few days ago that day was the worst day of my life. It must not have been. It's today. Are you acting like this because I had you ride an ambulance? - That's just- - You must have had your own circumstances. I don't expect your understanding but even I have my own circumstances so don't look at me too strangely- I won't look at you. Right. Even if not today, make sure to go back to the hospital. Your temperature is too cold compared to your inherent size. Arrived at the destination You can stop here. If the greeting of "goodbye" were to be the last words I think that would be sufficient carfare. You don't give a person the space to be thankful. Well anyway, I am indebted to you. I suppose this will be our last greeting. Goodbye. Ah...it's all wet. LOSIR ==&gt; LOSER Desert &amp;Tea Boutique I thought that if I just believed in it I was the Kang Joo Eun that could do anything. That's what I thought. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me. Why are you doing this? Don't do this. Just this once. This woman only asks me to save her when she sees me. While she's not even going to be thankful.
