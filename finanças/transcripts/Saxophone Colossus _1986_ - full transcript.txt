- Before a concert I try to meditate on what I have to do, I try to block out any extraneous thoughts. I try to think about what it's going to be like, I try to will the band to sound good. I try to act in a positive way, and I try to create a picture of what I hope is going to happen on the stage. So it's sort of a meditation, in a way, prior to performing. (upbeat jazz music) (crowd applauding) Of course, I was born here, number one, in Harlem, and the great excitement here in New York, of course. I always felt New York was the center of a lot of music, at least during the time when I was growing up. 52nd Street was where everybody was playing and I had a chance to really hear some of the great musicians. And you know, there's just the energy, the wonderful energy that is in New York and nowhere else. - My first memories of Sonny Rollins is when he recorded with J.J Johnson for Prestige. I had been hearing about him a little bit, they kept saying there's this tenor player up town who's really upsetting everybody and I heard that some of the test pressings on this date and was kind of impressed and was told about him in the studio, they way he stood, I guess he impressed this friend of mine who had seen him and that he really assumed the very planted stance and dug in and just blew. I guess the first reaction to hearing him in person was, and also on that record was that, here was a guy who had heard Charlie Parker and was putting that kind of knowledge into the tenor saxophone differently, say, than Dexter Gordon, who was acknowledged to be the first to translate Charlie Parker's mode to the tenor. Because at that time, people were very rigid and they said, "Oh yes, you can sound like that on alto, like Bird, "but you can't play like that on tenor." And each little step of the way had to be won in people's minds. Sonny, even in his rawest period, in that first period when a lot of critics were putting him down, I felt he had something very, very personal and unique to say and certainly he was not the polished Sonny Rollins that he would become after the Chicago period and coming back with Max Roach and Clifford Brown and really turning everyone's heads arounds, that's when he really established himself. But I feel all through the earlier period, '51 through '53, he played a lot of valuable music as we know from listening to the records. - I started listening to Sonny in 1965 and 1966, and the thing that hit me the most was the extraordinary personal authority of the man in the way he played, in the way he addressed the audience, in the way he addressed the piece of music. The incident at Saugerties where he jumped off the cliff is not uncharacteristic of Sonny because he always had a very strong visual sense, he's a performer who likes to keep the audience entertained. I remember the one time there was a concert in '66 called Titans of the Tenor that he shared a bill on with Coleman Hawkins, Zoot Sims, and John Coltrane, and Dave Lampert was the MC and he said, "And now Sonny Rollins," and a much shorter fellow walked out, it was Yusef Lateef, whom Sonny had just convinced to come along for the gig, who was not billed, and after Yusef played several chords, Sonny walked out, all in black, black Keds sneakers, black pants, black T-shirt, walked straight to the back of the stage, and started to improvise chords behind Lateef and then came up for, I think he was playing Hold 'Em Joe with Calypso, and then went into a whole incredible 15, 20 minute solo thing. And the control of the horn, the time, the phrasing, everything about it just held you in your seat. And so even if you were a novice, as I was at that time, there was something about Rollins that was so compelling that you understood him. I never understood, I used to see reviews where people would talk about him being too complex or intellectual and the great thing about Rollins is that he is a communicator, he always tells a story. I think he's the most compelling tenor saxophonist we have right now. - Whenever talking about Sonny Rollins I almost feel the need to preface anything I might say by pointing out that I consider him to be the greatest living jazz improvisor. Of course, that puts the standards higher by which you have to judge Sonny Rollins and you can only imagine the standards by which he must judge himself. Play time for us is work time for him. We just go to enjoy his concerts. To him it means something else, something much greater seems to be a stake and I think some of that tension communicates itself to an audience and it becomes pretty fascinating. - I dropped out of the jazz scene in 1959 which was more well known, that was the bridge period when I practiced on the bridge for a while. As you know, I'm always trying to improve myself and I'm partly a self-taught musician and all my career I've been trying to improve my craft. So at that point I had dropped out and figured I'd stay away from music and the music scene and everybody and just try to improve my playing and I studied piano for it again. And so, that was a very important period, a publicized period. I had been practicing on the bridge and I think a jazz writer had seen us on the bridge, seen me on the bridge practicing and he wrote a little story about it and it became famous, infamous Sonny Rollins practicing alone on the bridge. So when I finally came back to the jazz scene and I came back to appearing, I was appearing in a night club and I made my debut again, I recorded for RCA at that time and we thought, well it would be apropos if we named the album The Bridge, or at least some songs in the album. - Although I never saw Sonny Rollins practicing on the bridge, I did see him blowing into a little closet in his apartment on Grand Street, he used that to muffle the sound so he wouldn't bother anybody and he could play at any hour. He also had a board on which he did exercises. He was drinking orange juice, he was into Rosicrucianism, and a complete contrast from the guy who had been strung out a few years earlier. So he did a complete about-face, he started really working on physical fitness and he knew that in order to be a tenor player, to have the endurance to play that instrument, that he had to be in shape and he talked about this. - Any instrument eventually gets to be a part of the person playing it, it's a very personal thing. And the saxophone is closer to me, I hate to say it's almost closer than Lucille. But she knows this already so she's not jealous. Before I was married to Lucille, though, I did have problems with girlfriends and my saxophone though, I must say that. And one of them broke up my saxophone at one time when she was mad at me. I was playing a very important job at the Five spot with Mingus and a lot of people. But the saxophone is very close to you and it's a very delicate instrument and the slightest thing can change the nuance that you put into it. So it can drive you crazy. It can drive you crazy because even if you know what you want to play, sometimes it doesn't come out because of the differences in the horn and it might not be working exactly right or something like that. So it's a very close relationship. - Obviously I think he's important. And just as obviously, I have a hard time explaining why to a general audience, why he is so important. It's almost gotta be accepted. In one sense, he's never been as influential at any given period as say, Miles Davis, well, as Miles Davis has been throughout Miles Davis' whole career. But he's never been as important as Miles, he's never been as influential as Coletrane was in the mid to late '60s, or Ornette Coleman during much of that same time. And I think one of the reasons is he's never, unlike them, he never formed the band in his own image. He's never been successful at doing that. And in a way, that almost enhances his appeal, that lack of context. It's just Sonny Rollins as the single most excellent standard of jazz you can possibly imagine. - Jazz is a music that's made be people playing together but the master improvisers are always the ones who set the tone, they take the lead, the bring everyone in around them and Sonny Rollins is someone who has listened to all the great players before him and come up with something of his own and that's the way the music moves along. His tone is so personal, that deep sound of his is like no other saxophonist. His sense of time, the rhythmic displacement, his pauses, his rests, the way he then comes rushing up from behind the beat. His ability to play at length and still come up with interesting ideas is something that stands out in my mind. - One of the most important aspects of Sonny's influence on jazz is his ability to improvise an extended solo and keep your attention and not just go through the cycle of choruses and chords. I guess the first examples were, again, an unlikely song, Irving Berlin's There's No Business Like Show Business, and There Are Such Things which has a a terrific cadenza at the end. And he figured out how to alternate the chorus and the verse in such a way to constantly keep you a little bit off balance while you're listening to the performance. And then he developed this subsequent record with a piece called Blue 7, and in writing about that I'd, Gunther Schuller coined the phrase thematic improvisation, well he meant by that was that Sonny will take a theme and he will use the melody to govern the improvisational ideas that follow rather than simply playing rote on the chord changes. And actually, Rollins has a lot of different ways that he organizes improvisations but the end product is that combining them together he manages to sustain interest for say, five, six choruses, 10, 12 minutes in a way that very few improvisers have ever been able to do. And it never becomes just a self-indulgent howl or a kind of emotional outpouring. It's always logical, it's always a kind of Aristotelian perfection of beginning and a middle and an end and he takes you someplace and you know where he's going. One of the pitfalls of that kind of playing is that with Sonny, as I mentioned earlier, there's no hiding for him. You always know when he's playing very well and when he's not because it's all right there on the plate for you. - Whenever I try to create anything, solos when I'm playing, what I'm basically trying to do is to blot out my mind as much as possible. And of course I've already learned the material, so after learning the material then I try to blot out my mind and just let it flow by itself. So I try not to really think too much about what I'm playing when I'm soloing. So I sorta have the structure already and then I just try to create and let it come by itself. (applauding) (audience applauding) - At certain points during my playing I leave the stage. Sometimes I go out into the audience and I get feedback from the audience. They stimulate me to do more and to get into different areas. And this is sort of what I had in mind when I was doing that concert. I figured that I would leave the stage, jump down off of the stage and then come back onto stage. And at first I said no, I looked and I figured it might be too steep but I thought I could manipulate it and I tried, at first I didn't. And it was unfortunate because I did sustain a broken heel. But I kept playing and I was very happy about that and I was happy that a lot of the people didn't realize that I was actually hurt or anything and they thought it was just a part of the performance. - At the time that Sonny came along, jazz was grappling with the problem of standards and how to play them and what to do to find new material. The previous generation, Parker and Gillespie had taken a lot of standard tunes and written their own chords and their own melodies and added substitute chords to the original chord progressions. Rollins went back and found all kinds of pieces that jazz musicians did not know what to do with or would not have known what to do with if he hadn't played them. Things like Jolson's songs and I'm an Old Cow Hand, Toot Toot Tootsie and all kinds of ballads and he made them credible as music, let alone as jazz music. He proved, and Miles Davis is someone else who did this, that if you find the right tempo, the right attack, the right approach for a piece of music, you can make it work for you. And so Rollins, even at the height of free jazz, never had to turn away from that. The whole standards record, he did a lot of those standards, weren't really standards until he brought them back into the jazz meilleur. - Right, he one time described it as, I was starting to do a list of them, and he said, he named a few others and he said, "Songs no one ever recorded before "and no one will ever record again." And as somebody else pointed out to me when I told that to them, of course they never record them again, it's because Sonny has made the definitive versions. It'd be crazy to record some of those songs again. - Well, I met Lucille in Chicago when I was playing Max Roach's group. And Lucille was a friend of a friend of mine, actually it was a musician that I was rehearsing with at the time, and this musician had a girlfriend who was a girlfriend of Lucille's so they both got together, I think, and came down to see us play some place. - The same girl or woman that Sonny talked about who was my friend had told me a lot about Sonny. She sort of wanted us to meet. And when I met him I knew, I knew right away that this was going to be something special. I don't believe he did but I did. And I was determined that this was the guy. She told me not to do this because she said you're gonna get hurt and don't get involved. Just have a good time but don't get involved. But I did. (laughs) I did the booking for a long time. Now I just do the managing and occasional booking. - Occasionally booking. - But I love it. And the producing came about because I was always involved anyway and starting about '78, there was a particularly difficult record, the Don't Stop the Carnival album, which was a... There were great problems with that album and Sonny was reluctant to go in the studio to mix it so Orrin and I, Orrin Keepnews, who was Sonny's producer at that time. - [Sonny] At that time, yeah. - Decided that if Sonny would let us we would mix it to spare him. And I think he was sort of at the point, he said, "Okay, go ahead." And so then it just changed from there. And finally we decided that we wanted to do everything our own way instead of having anybody else to say do this this way or this way or this way, we wanted to do it the way that was most comfortable for Sonny. And it wasn't anything against Orrin because we're still friends but it was just we wanted to do it all our way. - Sonny Rollins on records is very often not the Sonny Rollins that we hear live. When I first started reading jazz criticism and listening to the records, I remember a critic reviewing the recording he made for RCA in the early '60s of If Ever I Would Leave You and saying it's a good record but it certainly can't compare with the extraordinary performance he gave at such and such a place. And I thought this is remarkable. It seemed to me, I was very naive of course, and I thought it's amazing that they wouldn't keep doing takes until they got something as good. But really that's been a constant throughout his career. We all have memories of some To a Wild Rose that he played that we'll never forget and the version on the record isn't quite up to that. Every time for a long time in the mid-'70s whenever I reviewed Sonny in concert I would get letters from people around the country telling me that I was nuts. How can you compare the latest Sonny Rollins record with Way Out West or Saxophone Colossus or Workout? And I would always tell them you have to see him live. And then finally in late '70s, or I guess it was maybe the early '80s, Fantasy put out Don't Stop the Carnival and it's got two performances on it, Silver City and Autumn Nocturne that are among the great Rollins masterpieces. And two of the people who had written me those letters wrote me back and said, "Just heard that record, "now I understand what you were talking about." So, Rollins really is the ultimate example of a musician who proves the old adage about jazz which is that the music is very much a process of communication between a player and the audience and sometimes for Sonny it just does not happen when he's playing to a glass booth. - In his defense though, Gary, don't you think the records are getting better? - Oh yes, I'm glad you said that. - [Francis] He's abandoned that approach. Not bringing in Donald Byrd or whomever. - Ever since Sonny and Lucille started producing themselves, I think the records have gotten better. - I get very angry and I get these nice fantasies. I think I told you of having a jazz critic up to a 39th floor apartment and telling him to look out the window and just step further, further. I have very nice fantasies. (speaking Japanese) (banging drums) - I've always wanted, actually, to work in different musical environments. The opportunity to do this piece came about through my sponsors here in Japan. And they asked me would I like to do an orchestral piece this time around. So of course I said I'd love to do it. I've never done anything quite like this before and because of that, of course, I sought the help of a good friend of mine, old musical companion of mine, Heikki Sarmanto. - I was in South America doing some playing and I came back to Helsinki, I flew first to New York and stayed there one day. And I was trying to call my old friend Sonny Rollins but I couldn't reach him in New York. I spent there only one night and then I commuted back home to Helsinki and as I walk into my apartment with all the luggage in my hand, the phone rings. And guess who it is? It's Sonny. And Sonny says, "I have this thing in Japan. "Would you be interested?" (piano music) - The themes were mine. I labored over them for some time trying to come up with what would sound proper in this context. And I asked Heikki to orchestrate them for me and to also conduct the orchestra for me. (singing) - And back to the beginning. And there the trumpets are beginning this letter here. Trumpets are coming in. (singing) While that's coming, the trumpets are coming in. (singing) Very Spanish feeling. (Heikki mumbles) (singing) Then we go to that theme. (singing) That's it, the rest right? One very important thing is that those ideas he had originally created, those little thematic patterns, they were so incredibly strong, melodic, very meaningful melodies. They were the seed for this whole piece. If you have even a tiny little thematic pattern, just a couple of bars, but if it's really good, strong, original line, from that you can make a whole big tree grow up. - I have been called a spontaneous orchestrator and so on. Of course this is not a spontaneous orchestration in that sense but I hope to bring some of those qualities to this piece in that I will still be improvising myself on many sections of it. No two performances of this concerto will be alike. And in that sense, it will be true to what I'm about. It is very much structured. And what will be different will be my relation to the structure, each time will be different. - I put them all together because we all have to play it. That should be it because they keep the whole thing together. - They need a little soft... - Yeah, a little soft there. I think it's going to be a dynamite concert. (laughs) Probably like most premieres, it's not gonna be technically finished yet but it will have the first performance excitement. - I'm actually quite excited about it and looking forward to it. (dramatic orchestral music) When I first came to Japan sometime ago I was very pleased to find that the Japanese fans were very much aware of the birth dates and the history of all of the jazz musicians, myself included. And I was very much excited about that. And I find that they're a very good audience. Very fine audience. They take their music very seriously. They keep up with everything that's happening, all the latest developments in the music. - These musicians here in the symphony orchestra, they are just amazingly professional. It's a very difficult piece of music, my goodness, and they have never been playing this type of music because frankly, I have never heard this type of piece being written for symphony orchestra. So this whole experience was very new for all of us, for Sonny, myself and the orchestra. - I try to always inject in my work with a spiritual quality, it sounds kind of grandiose to put it in that way but... I have studied Zen in Japan here. I did study. I studied yoga in India. Of course, I was born a Christian in the United States and I found elements of all these religions that are quite similar in many ways. So, philosophy, religion, spirituality, all these things, it's never very far away from what I'm doing at any time. And I'm sure that when I'm playing here in Japan that's the case as it is when I'm playing in the United States and other parts of the world. (dramatic orchestral music) (audience applauding) My parents come from the Caribbean area of the world, the islands, and it might be significant that Japan of course is an island. And on our last trip to Japan, there's an area of Japan near Hiroshima and we were traveling from one part of Japan to another and we were nearing Hiroshima and I happened to, it was striking the resemblance between the island and the area in the Caribbean, it was very much similar. And it never really occurred to me until then but it so happened that after that, not too long after that, a Japanese friend of mine brought up the fact that perhaps this is the reason why I'm so liked in Japan because the island connection is there in some mysterious way. So being a guy that's kind of mysterious myself, I thought hey, it's alright, why not? So I'm all for it if that's happening. I've been here now, this will be my twelfth time that I've been in Japan for a tour. So I think the Japanese people like me and I like the Japanese people. I like all people, I consider myself like most jazz musicians do as diplomats of course and ambassadors for the United States and we're usually treated quite well around the world and so I take my job in that respect quite seriously. And I find that I've been accepted here by the Japanese and I also accept them and like them quite a great deal. (audience applauding) I'm not that well-known. I'm not the most famous person in the world so a lot of places where we play, people don't know anything about me at all. I have played places where I play in front of people that really don't know anything about me. So in a way, when I'm presented as the greatest or one of the greatest or something like that, it gives me a little leeway and people are not quite so hostile and judging of me. So I'm able to sort of walk in and feel a little more able to lead into things in a more natural way instead of really having to prove everything I play every minute that I play it. I don't feel I'm the greatest anything, I still feel I'm a developing musician so as far as I'm concerned I'm still proving it to myself all the time, but it's good when I don't have to prove it to audiences. - One thing I'd like to say about Sonny, and we haven't touched on it, is his marvelous interpretation of his West Indian heritage and the way he plays those kind of songs. And I remember being down in Saint Thomas for the first time and this was after Sonny had done the song called St. Thomas, and walking along the street one night passing under a window where there was a dance going on and the saxophone player in that band down there, who was not a jazz band, they were playing Calypso, but the sound that he got was exactly the sound that Sonny can get when he wants to duplicate that style in addition to doing a lot of other things with the improvisation on something like Don't Stop the Carnival or Hold 'Em Joe. - There was a time in my career when I thought that my soloing and my playing would be able to turn the world around. I'd be able to change politics and influence things for the better. I don't have these illusions anymore. Now, all I want to do is to maybe bring enjoyment to myself and enjoyment to those people that appreciate a little bit of my art and what I'm doing. And I think that just being able to do that is plenty. - To me, and people could say I'm not objective, I feel his playing is much stronger and more beautiful now than it's ever been. I think not only, and I'm not talking just technically, but I think because he's changed as a person over the years and I sense more, and somebody else commented on this the other day so it's not just me, that there's now more warmth and more feeling and more depth than ever in his playing. And I've never heard him play better and I honestly mean that. And I'm in awe of his playing aside from loving him as my husband, I think he's spectacular. (audience applauding) (audience cheering)
