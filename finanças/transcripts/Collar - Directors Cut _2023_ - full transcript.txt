Five tricks in five tries. Whoa, wait a minute. This one's 18 today. Whoa, we get to go upstairs, bro. Look at this. He's working juvie, and now she's an adult. Hallelujah! Who's up in 64? - What? - Naw, never mind. Come on, we're here. - Hey, man, how am I supposed to stand before this guy now? - You're a professional. - Yeah, but I gotta picture him in a wig and tits now while you're off fishing someplace. - Hinky, baby, let's move. - Oh yeah, we don't wanna be late to Judge Julie now. - You know what? I gotta run downstairs and grab something. - Wait a minute, where you going? - I just gotta grab something. I'll be right behind you. I'll catch up. - Catch up, you know, that's what my first wife said. And you know what? She never caught up. - Oh, you big pussy, get up there. Coming through. Look out! - TJ, what's the dope? - Don't you ever get tired of that narc humor? - What's the matter, you crashing? - Zip it. - Ladies, ladies, what am I hearing? - Miss Allensworth? - Yes, Your Honor. - Miss Allensworth, are you prepared to move forward? - Well, Your Honor, frankly, we expected to pursue this case in another court. - What do you mean? - This woman is an adult now. - Yeah, you guys are very funny, laugh a minute. - What the fuck are you looking for? - I just had it, right here. Oh, there we go. - Oh ho, Timothy. - Well that answers the question. - What? - You've obviously been paid off. - 25 years I've been on this job, never took anything from anybody! - Now, charges? - Miss Lufkin is charged with solicitation. She was on probation, so we would like to remand her to County to serve remainder of time. - How much time? - 109 days, Your Honor. - TJ, yo, man. He didn't mean it. It's fucking Tommy, man, he doesn't think. Now just, you see those fucking cameras up there, man. You don't wanna go out like that. All right, I've guys go down for less than that. Get on outta here now. - Tommy, I'm sorry, man. I lost it, I'm sorry. - Get on outta here. Go go go. - [TJ] Now! - Where's your lawyer? Young lady, stand up, look at me. Where's your lawyer? - He called me, he said he couldn't make it in this early. - Is that Mister Levine? Okay, we'll hold for a second call. - Your Honor, I have a trial this morning. - All right, I'll enter a not guilty plea on her behalf right now. Let the record show that the defendant has entered a not guilty plea. Miss Allensworth, bail? - Once again, Your Honor, the state requests that the defendant be remanded to custody. - Denied. Bail set at $1,000. Bailiff, please escort the defendant to my chambers for conference. - Your Honor. - Is there something wrong, Miss Allensworth? - I don't think that a meeting in your chambers is gonna help her. - Counselor, that's dangerously close to contempt. You're more than welcome to join us in chambers. - I'd like to join you in your little conference there, Your Honor. I'd like to see what's going on here. - Order in the court! - What the hell you looking at? - Order in the court! - Miss Allensworth, I suggest that you control and advise your witness. - Yes, sir. Listen, jerkoff, this is not the way to take care of this. - Oh yeah? And what is? We got kids here selling their bodies for goodies. I'm going in there. - Hey, man, are you kidding me? This son of a bitch'd eat you alive. Come on, TJ. We'll think of something else, all right? Come on. - I'm out of here. I've got better things to do than chase mad dogs and teeny boppers all day. - What the hell's that supposed to mean? - Hey, I'm in the middle of a murder trial. I don't have time for this. - You better make time. There's gonna be a lot more teeny boppers in body bags, and then what? - Just make sure it's not you putting them there. - This court is in recess until the top of the hour. (crowd chattering) - Whoa, TJ, TJ. Don't even think about it, man. (soft music) Let's go, partner. - Yeah, I'm right behind you. - I'm gonna set up our bust. Hey, no no, not this time, kemo sabe. Come on, come on come on, come on, man. (soft music) - All right, all right, listen up now. We don't know who this guy is or what he looks like. So you need to keep your eyes and your ears open. - Everybody else who's on foot, keep your wires open. We go at 20 hundred hours. That's eight PM for you nonmilitary types. Okay, four hours away. Hit it, let's go. Hey, come on, man, we gotta go down and change. - So, you wanna let me know where this noise got started? - Oh come on, Gina. - I don't get it. - Come on, Cap, vice has popped two dozen tricks and a commune of johns in that mall in the last week alone. - Man, we are seeing a shitload of Special K and Horse flowing through the schools. - Look, whoever's doing this is very well connected, and very slick. - Did you call the OC? - The feds? This is local. - How do you know? - We got this under control. - Yeah, bullshit. Like the locker room? - What's she talking about? - Nothing. - What about the courtroom? - [TJ] Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. - Just a little manly pause problem, all right? I'll keep my eyes on him. - Yeah, you do that. I wanna relax for this retirement party. When is it anyway? - 32 days. - That soon? - Yeah, that soon. - Stay sharp. Get out. (upbeat music) - Man, I knew giving you the keys was a mistake. - Come on, cut me some slack and stop your whining. - Yeah, I'll cut you some slack. The last time I did that, they almost hung me by my short hairs. - [TJ] There she is.

You're one of them, aren't you? - One of who? - Does your father know what the .. Does your father know what you do with yourself at night? - No. - No. You know what? I bet your daddy's a pimp. - Shut your ugly mouth, you fucking creep. - Oh, I hit a nerve, huh? You know, you oughta use toilet cleaner on that scoop you've got. - Please, just don't tell my father. He'd die. Shit, he'd kill me. Please, Mr. Williams, I'll do you both. Anything you want. - Are you hearing this? - Hey, hey hey hey, just take it out in the hall for one minute. - For what? - Take it outside. Just please? - All right, but you better be careful. She's liable to do you. - Get out. (soft piano music) (door opening) (handcuffs clicking) I know you're scared. - Oh God, please. - You know, we're the good guys? - Yeah, right. - You can walk out that door right now. Only problem is, somebody'll put you right back in here later. Thing about that is you don't know what they're gonna do. Maybe they kidnap you, sell you into slavery. Maybe even snuff you. Least that'd be quick. (gunfire in distance) (siren blaring in distance) Or, maybe you end up with a lifetime of STDs. Or go something slow, like the Big A. Long, ugly, nasty death. - Yeah yeah yeah, I don't wanna listen to this shit. What do you want? - You know, you keep talking that way, I'm gonna have him come back in here. - I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. - How do you know me? - Everybody knows you. I used to live right down the street from you. Bonnie Lufkin, you're Ed Lufkin's daughter. Whoa, shit, you grew up. - Yeah, sort of. (exhaling) - So what is it you think you know about me? - Well I've heard you're a bad-ass. - Oh, is that right? And what do you think? - I guess you're kinda nice. - You want out of this situation? - I don't know. - You like what you're doing? - Hey, it pays good, all right. - Great English. I just told you a half a dozen ways in which it doesn't pay at all. - It's hopeless. - Well then why don't you let me help you out? - Just please, please don't tell my father. He'd kill me. - I don't get it. Was he forcing you to do this? - Hey, what the hell is going on in there, TJ? You all right? - Hey, give me a couple of minutes, will you? - She do you yet? - I heard that, you pig. - Sorry, partner. - I did something for some friends, got a little high. One thing let to another. Couple of days later, the guy comes to me, hands me a video, says he's got a proposition for me. - Yeah? - It's me, lying in bed, doing all kinds of stuff. I don't even remember this. And then he says that he's gonna show my father, unless I do this. - Son of a bitch. - Hey, what's going on, man? - Hey, just give me one more minute. So who is this scumbag? - No, no, I can't. - Oh come on, what is he, some punk? - No, he's really connected. - Let us protect you. - I don't know. - All right. This is my card, okay? - Okay. - This is my cellphone. - Okay. - So you do yourself and all your little girlfriends a great big favor, don't wait too long to use that. - Okay, thank you, Mr. TJ. - Yeah, okay. All right, now listen. We've been doing it in here. You got that? - Yeah. - Okay, when you get back out there, you be very careful. You go straight home, comprende? - Okay. - Hey, what happened in there? - Nothing. - Come on, man, are you gonna tell me what happened or not? - We're done. - Done with what? - I'll tell you when we get where we're going. - Going where? - Back where we were. - What, the mall? - Yeah. (engine starting) (upbeat music on radio) - What the hell happened in there? Did you do her? What? I'm just checking. - The hell with the mall. Pull over here, I'm gonna kick your ass. - Oh, you're oversexed and violent, huh? You know what they say? Latins make the best lovers, Papa. - Yeah, well I guess we'd have to ask an authority about that. - Hey, you know what, I'm glad you said that. - Hey, hey, man, where you going? - [Angel] To ask the expert. - [TJ] Who? - [Angel] Evie, who else? - [TJ] Oh come on, you schmuck, we're on the job. - Yeah, you know what? I haven't even had my first doughnut of the night. - Yeah, tell me about, since you been seeing Evie we've been eating twice as many of them, what's with that? - Hey, what can I say?

Told you. - Told him what? - He says Latins make the best lovers. - Oh, well, I wouldn't think you'd have to tell TJ that. - What are you kidding me? He married his prom queen, and he's still with her, right, T? - Yeah. - Yeah, I know and how is Doris, TJ? - Oh, you just stepped on my toe. - Oh, is that what that was? You must have huge feet. - Yeah. - Sorry. Come on, I'll get you guys a table. - No, no no, no no. We're on the job, we gotta go. - Oh. - Just came in for a quickie. - Is that right? - No, baby, quick doughnut, quick doughnut. - Oh, well I think that can be arranged. - You trying to get us both killed? - What? I thought that's what you wanted. - Yeah, but she's gonna have my head on a stick, man. I'll be lucky if I get anything before Christmas. - Yeah, well, you know, a stud like you, what's a couple of months? - Oh yeah, it's easy for you to say. You've got Doris at home. - Nice of you boys in blue to stop by. - Come on, we are on the job here. - Yeah, like, these people don't know who and what you are. - You mean our cover's blown? - Yeah, and that's about all that's gonna get blown too. - Oh, come on, baby, he was just kidding. - You know how I feel about you, Evie. - Do I? Tell me again. - Hey, play nice. - Please, forgive me. I forgot myself. - Mm, now that's better. Now you may go. (diners chattering) - Thanks a lot, partner. - Think nothing of it, compadre.

Hey, tell your girlfriend you're busy and hang up the phone, for God sake, and come on back to bed. - Alice, put a sock in it. You don't know what you're talking about. - Gina, all right, just-- What do you mean they know? Already, before I-- All right, wait, look, kid, I need you to put a lid on it, I'll be there in five. Okay? - Where the hell are you going? (water running) - There's been a shooting. - So what? - TJ Williams. - TJ? Is he dead? - No. No. He's the shooter. - Oh shit. - Exactly. Son of a bitch couldn't wait till I was gone. Honey, he shot a Black kid. Okay, look, I need you to go back to sleep. I know it's all gonna be okay. Okay? Okay, it's gonna be okay. Just go back to sleep. I'll be right back. Let's just hope the poor child's not dead. - Oh yeah, right. - Hey, partner. It's over, T. - What? - He's gone, man. It's time to turn it in. - He's gone? Oh God. - Afraid so. - Kyle. What were they doing there? - I don't know, he's not giving that up. - What? Oh no, no no, he can't do that. They'll bust him. I'll bust him. - Listen, T. Look, if you ask me, you oughta leave it alone for a while, all right? You're gonna have your hands full enough as it is. - What, why? - Aw, man. Look, the shit has hit the fan, partner. The DA got a hold of this thing already. They're talking about some serious smackdown on you, bro. I'm afraid I have some more bad news for you. They found the Lufkin girl. - Yeah? - Detective Timothy J. Williams? - Yeah. - Will you come with us, please? - Where we going? - We have some questions to ask you. It's just a formality. - We have to ask you for your shield and weapons at this time, TJ. (soft music) - Listen, um, call Doris, tell her I probably won't be home for dinner. I might be a little bit late. Am I gonna need an attorney? - You might wanna consider it. (soft music) - Have her call Lenny. Where we going? - County. - You gonna cuff me? - That won't be necessary, will it? - Listen, T. Don't you even worry about it, all right. I've got you covered, man. (exhaling) I'll say a prayer. (soft music) - [Woman On PA] Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Dr. Kravitz, a visitor on the main lobby. (soft guitar music) - Yeah? - Your Honor, Chief Markham is here to see you. - You have a future, a big one. - Tell him I will see him later in his office. - He says he's been calling but couldn't get through. - He has not been calling. - It's really urgent. - Tell him to go take a cold shower. - I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't quite get that. - No, but if you stick around long enough, I'm sure you will. - Excuse me. - Actually, Gladys, why don't you take lunch? Have my calls transferred to Kimberly, and show him in. - Okay. - Thank you, Gladys. Thank you very much. (door closing) So. Mm. Ah! What the hell did you do that for? - When were you planning on telling me about the mess you dumped on my Senate campaign? - What? - The shooting, you jackass. Why don't you just throw one right in the water and sink the whole damn boat? - Well, look, I just found out about it myself, okay. - Oh? When? - About 4:30 this morning. - Hm. Seven hours and 45 minutes ago. Time must fly when you're having fun. - What was I supposed to do, Nomi? Call you up and go, this young Black kid is dead, huh? Shit, hello, there's a young Black kid, he's dead. - The kid, as you call him, turns out to be the pride of the Black community. I have been fielding calls since the minute I got in this morning. I'm more like a fire chief than a mayor. You should have at least given me a heads-up. - I was trying. I was, I was, I was trying to stop it, I was trying to put a ... I was trying not to involve you. Damage control, you know. I was trying to help. I don't know. - Yeah? Well, I do know. I am the mayor. Not your buddy, not your trampoline, but your effing boss. - You're bullshitting me, right? Nomi, you better be. - Don't Nomi me. (exhaling) You want this job, right? You wanna sit in this office? Well you don't get to move in until I move out, and that means up to the Senate. Am I clear? - Very clear. - Okay. - And where are you going? - I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. Where do we go from here? - You have to find some way to get our righteous Reverend Sparks onboard. - Son of a bitch. Huh? - Because I did not climb this far up the pole just to have some trigger-happy burnout grease it for me now. So, where were we? - Um. (Nomi giggling) - We interrupt this broadcast to bring you up to date on the latest local unrest. It has been learned by this reporter that young Billy Taylor the all-star athlete and scholar who was shot and killed last week, was attempting to confront a suspected drug dealer. Police have no further comment at this time. Now, on another front ... - [Group] One, two, three, break! (crowd applauding and cheering) - Ready, and go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! (ball bouncing) (group chattering) Come on, make your cuts. Make your cuts. Come on, make your cuts. (group chattering) (whistle blowing) Hold it, hold it, hold it. Ladies and gentlemen, we have an illustrious guest with us today. We're honored with the presence of, I don't know if you people watch TV or read the papers or listen to the radio, but this is our, our honored police chief. This is Hamilton Markham, soon to be mayor, right? Say hi, everybody. (crowd applauding) Okay, there you go. - Hello, ladies, and hello, gentlemen. This is just TJ being TJ. I still want your vote. However old you are. - Yeah, okay, okay, listen, why don't you take them on in there? - Get this gear all cleared outta here. This'll just take a minute. Okay, go, now. - All right, girls, we're all through with practice. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. - Oh God. - Did I get you? No, did I get you? - Yeah, you got me, you stupid son of a bitch. Leave me alone. - Huh? Let me take a look. - It's fine, God. It's fine. - So, uh, what'd you come down here for, Boss? - You shoulda gotten outta that car when I did. - Yeah, well, you know, some guys are meant to ride a desk and other guys are meant to ride the street. - Oh, come on. You coulda packed it in years ago. So tell me. What happened out there? - If I knew, I would tell you. - That's all you got? I can't help you on this one, pal. - Oh, would you help me if you could, pal? - Oh come on, man. We started out together. We were partners together. We've been through the academy together. I helped you dozens of times. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah, that is right! I pulled you outta some deep shit over the years. A million times, you know that. But, I can't do anything for you now. Everybody wants to take you down. - Everyone? - Everyone. The DA, the clergy. The CRB, and the politicos, just to name a few. - Oh (laughs). Oh, that's what this is about. - What? - You come down here for that, oh, man. You're running for mayor, right? And senator? - Don't fuck with me. - No, come on, man, isn't that what it is? I messed you up, didn't I? What about the kid? What about Billy Taylor, huh? What about him? - Oh, fuck you, what about the kid? You killed the kid! - And I need you tell me-- - He's dead. Billy Taylor's dead! - That's right, he is! - It doesn't have to go like this, man. What's wrong with you? I just, I'm gonna take, we're gonna take care of his family, okay, and I just came down here, please. TJ, please, I just came down here to make it better, okay? And I'm begging you to help me. Think about Doris, my wife, come on. Why you gotta be so hard? What did it ever get you? And don't walk away from me. I'm still your boss, you son of a bitch. - Yeah, for about five more minutes. And you leave Mom out of this. (upbeat dramatic music) - We are continuing our investigation. Detective Timothy Williams is suspended indefinitely, pending the outcome of our formal inquiry. - Oh. (groaning) I always knew, you know? They finally got me. Know what I mean? - Come on, compadre. Don't be talking bullshit, man. (exhaling) Hey look, man. You have the most good collars out of anyone in the entire history of this outfit, Timmy. - Timmy? (laughing) You and my mother. Yeah, Timmy was a kid with a goofy dog. My mother called me Timmy because she wanted to be June Lockhart, that silly old drunk. - Who, June Lockhart? - No, my mother, you asshole. Thank God she didn't live to see this. She loved Martin Luther King Junior. - What are you babbling about, man? Get your shit together. You're really starting to scare me. - It's all over, my Latin brother. I'm toast. Hey, watch your back, buddy. - Come on, man, stop talking shit to me. Look, you take the hit and you get back in the game. All right? Come on. - Game's over, Holmes. Take your greasy paws off me. Get a grip yourself. You're better off without me. - Shit. What the fuck is that? (protestors shouting) - [Group] End the hate! Stop the racism! - The badly beaten body of that young prostitute who was found last week has been positively identified as that of Bonnie Lufkin. She had turn 18 just a day before this grim discovery was made. More news as it happens. ♪ My friends say forget you ♪ ♪ And move on to better things ♪ ♪ They say I'll never-- ♪ - Do you think for one minute that I meant to kill that boy? - Come on now, you two, don't do this. - He wasn't a boy. Don't you call him boy, he was a man. Don't you ever call him boy! Call him Roy or Leroy or hoi polloi, but don't you ever call him boy, see. That's the problem, you racist fucking pig. - Kyle! - What did you just say to me? What did you say to me? What did you say to me, punk? - Yeah, that's right, I am a punk. I am a punk! I didn't murder your best friend, did I? - Hey, that was accident! If you two hadn't been there, he'd still be alive! - And if he wasn't Black, you wouldn't have shot him! - All right, stop it right now! - Tell her. Come on, admit it. If my ass was on that fence, you woulda shot me, would you, Pop? You'd shoot your own son. - How dare you say such a thing. Your father loved Billy Taylor. I can't believe you're saying this. Your father took you both to your first baseball game. He taught you how to throw a ball! What is wrong with you? - It's all right, Dore. It's okay. Let the boy go. - Billy Taylor wasn't a boy! And neither am I. - Oh yes you are! And neither one of you had any business being anywhere near that place! - It's a fucking shopping mall. How did we know what's gonna happen? You fucking knew him. You knew him. Why didn't you recognize him? Fuck, what's the use? I'm outta here. - You come back here, Kyle. You come back and apologize! Kyle! He didn't mean it. He's hurt. He lost his friend. - Nah, he didn't lose him. I killed him. It was dark. He's Black. Kyle's right. - No, he's not, and you stop this. TJ! - [Newscaster] On the financial front, volatility remains the play of the day as the Dow dips drastically after yesterday's gains. The Dow barely broke 18,000 and showed scant signs of any future life as thousands more dropped from the rolls of the unemployed, which now hovers at around 5%. Speaking of rolls, let's see what Jan has-- - Where you going dressed like that? - To work. - Work? What work? Your work is here. - Yeah, well, we've got bills. And the pay that I get for what I've been doing around here the last couple decades isn't gonna cut it. - Wait wait, wait wait. - Ow. - My insurance'll cover it. - Don't do this to me. Just, don't do this. - Don't do what? You're being silly, it's just temporary. Timothy, you're hurting me. Manny at the diner says I can have my old job back, just till you get back on top. - No, you're not going anywhere. What are you doing with that? Where you going with those? Dancing? - Listen, hotshot, we have got to get realistic about the possibilities here. We don't know how long you're gonna have to deal with this fallout, and we have no money coming in. - You worked 25 years for those. - And I'll work 25 more, I promise. I love that you gave those to me. You made me feel like a queen. But I don't need them. I need you, and the kids. That's all. - Don't be too late. - I won't. Love you, Timothy James Williams. - Love you too, Doris Lakshmi Johnstone. - Hey! Close that bathroom door. It's hotter than hell in here. - Okay, relax, Dad. Winter's coming soon enough. Besides, you always tell me how much you loved Indian summers. - Yeah, well, that's before I hit this manly pause and started getting these hot flashes. Hey, grab me another beer in there, will you, Dore? - What'd you just call me? - I don't know, brewski? - Very funny. You just called me Dore. Mom's working tonight, remember? Till midnight at Manny's. (scoffing) (soft mysterious music) Why are you looking at me like that? - What, can't even look at my own daughter? - Not like that, you pervy weirdo. - Well now there's some respect. Why don't you just go upstairs, put on some clothes instead of running around in your birthday suit? - Daddy! Daddy, what are you doing? - Come on! - Daddy, I'm serious. Stop it! Daddy, stop it, Daddy! Stop it! (crying) Daddy? Daddy, are you there? (soft piano music) Daddy, are you there? (soft piano music) - Yeah. (soft piano music) - Daddy, come on. Please stop, okay? Are you okay? (soft piano music) - Yeah, I'm just playing. Do you remember what it was like to play? - No, you never played like that before. - You never been like this before. - You scared me. - You used to love to be scared. - Not anymore, okay? (soft piano music) Daddy, please promise you won't. - I promise. (soft piano music) - Okay. Well, I have to get ready for a date now. - Hm, you have a date? That's great. Anybody I know? - No, just this guy I met at work. He's a big shot, though. He's really nice. - Okay. Well, I guess I'll go back and finish watching the ballgame. - Okay. I'll be out in a few. - Okay (clicks tongue). (soft music) (exhaling) (soft music) Whoa. You look beautiful. - Thanks. Dad, what was all that about? - What was what about? - What just happened. - I give up, what just happened? - Come on, Dad. - I was having a little fun. What? - You need to stop drinking that shit, because you been acting really weird. - Come on, I was playing. - Yeah, well, I'm not playing. Don't do that again, or I'm outta here. - Yeah? Well, maybe you oughta be outta here. - What? Do you mean that? - Why not? You're a grown woman. Maybe you oughta be out there on your own. (knocking on glass) - I'll get it. It's probably my date. - No no no, this is still my castle, Princess. You go on upstairs and finish getting ready. (dog whining) Can I help you? - Yeah, hi. That's a nice pit bull. - That's an American standard Staffordshire bull terrier. You were saying? - Um, I'm here for Margaret. You must be her father? - Margaret? Peggy? - Right, I'm sorry, Peggy. Carl, Carl Davies. - Hi, Carl, come in. That's my dad. Dad, that's Carl. Introduce yourselves, I'll be right out. - It's nice to meet you, Mr. Williams. - TJ. Would you care for a drink? - No thanks, I'm driving. - Come on in. Pretty nice ride you got there, Carl. What kinda car is that? - That's a Z. - A Z? - Yeah, a Z Three. - Ready? - Yeah. - Your friend here ... - Carl? - Carl and I were talking about his car. That looks like it's pretty expensive. Where'd you get that? - I bought it. As a matter of fact, it did cost a bundle. - Daddy, don't be rude. - No it's okay. I get where he's coming from. He's right, you can't be too careful these days. - Carl owns the software company that I work for, Dad, okay? - Oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. That's very impressive. - Thank you. - Well, it was nice to meet you, Carl. You guys have a nice time. - Dad, we'll talk more about that other thing later, okay? - Okay. Love you, baby. - Love you, Dad. - Take good care of my girl. - Yes, sir, I certainly will. After you. Good night. (door creaking) - [Eve] TJ, you're drunk. Doris left around midnight. Shouldn't you go home? - What's going on here? What is happening here? - Nothing. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Nothing is going on here, and nothing more is gonna go on here, Timothy. - Uh-oh. She did it. She called me Timothy. She is pissed. - You know what? I'm outta here. - Where we going? - Listen, fool, I've already told you. We're history. Finito. Caput. - Please, just, just for tonight. - Can't you hear? I aint your ho no mo. - Hey, hey. Don't you ever say that. You were never that to me. Don't talk that way. You're my friend. - Yeah? Well you don't bang your friends. - Well if you can't bang your friends, who can you bang? - Right, TJ, that's you. All for one, and all for fun. Let's just hear it for me, right? You know, what about Doris? - [TJ] Oh. - [Eve] Isn't she your friend? You know, what about Angel? - Can't we just leave them outta this? - No, we can't, because you know what? They're my friends too. I can't go on with this. I won't. Excuse me. - No. - Hey, babe. You ready? - Um (chuckles), yeah, you know what? I just need to change. And, I'll be out there in a minute. - All right, I'll be in the car. - Is everything all right? - I don't know. You tell me. - You know what? I'll be right there. - Hey, don't you say hello to your old partner? - Partner? What partner. I don't see no stinking partner here, man. - Hey. Hey, what the fuck is your problem, partner? - Not a fucking thing, asshole. - What'd you say? - Egomaniac, son of a bitch. You aint got shit to tell me, TJ, nothing! Damn! You aint my partner! Why don't you get the hell out of here before I put your damn ass in the hospital? Go ahead! (vomiting) Shit! (laughing) What are you laughing about? You know, you're just as bad as he is. - Yeah. I know. That's part of the problem. (TJ moaning) I'm sorry, baby. (kissing) (laughing) - My brand-new shoes. Look at this. - Hey hey hey. Hey, who said it was gonna be easy, huh? Come on. Come on, he is your partner. - Oh, he's my partner. Listen to yourself. You know, I oughta leave the both of you right there. I need to check my head. The both of them. - You know, maybe if you helped me out here I can take care of some of that later. - Really? - Yes, really. Men. It's all you guys ever think about. Come on, come on. (TJ moaning) Come on (speaks Spanish). - Oh. (soft music) (doorbell ringing) - [TJ] Where we going? (doorbell ringing) - Oh, hey, Doris. Sorry about this. There was nothing I could do. - Yeah, I know, Angel. Thanks for bringing him home. You too, Evie. He's been going through some stuff, you know? Hey, I didn't know you two were an item. Are you? - Yeah, for a while now. Um, listen, we need to talk. You know, girly stuff, we'll catch up at work. - Yeah, sure, hon. Thanks for bringing him home. - And you make sure you tell that ugly mug I'm gonna kick his ass when he sobers up, all right? - Oh, can I watch? Bye. - Thanks again. - Bye. - I cannot believe you wanted to leave him in front of the house, you are so ridiculous. (TJ humming) - Come on, Evie, let's do it doggy style like we used to. Let me watch you. Oh shit, Doris, what are you doing here? - Yeah, it's me, Oh Shit Doris, and I live here. What's your excuse? - Oh, baby, I'm sorry, honey. - Yeah me too. - Come on, baby. - Mom, are you okay? Dad? - Yeah, Dad, smell that moldy bag of shit? - This is your father, Kyle Williams, and you don't talk like that in my house. Hey, that's enough, you two. Go to bed. I can take care of him. I have for 25 years. - Well maybe you oughta consider retiring. - Kyle, I said I've had enough of your smart mouth. Now go to bed! - What? - You're just like him. - I'm nothing like him. - Yeah, you are, you always have been. Is that what you wanna turn into? - Shut up, I hate you! - A drunk ass-- (arguing continues) - [Newscaster] Another 20 civilians were mistakenly targeted and killed by American drones today. The High Command apologized for the mishap. - Listen, I'm working a double, so I'm gonna be home late. - How late? - I don't know. What is it you used to say to me? Late is late. Where are my keys? - Well, you are coming home, right? (sighing) - Yeah, I'll be home. I still have kids here. Here they are, right in my pocket. Okay, listen, Peggy's sleeping. She has a big day planned, so be nice to her. - What? I'm always nice. Yeah, I heard about yesterday's nice. - Oh come on, that's my little girl. We're gonna be fine. - You're little girl? No, she is not your little girl. She's a grown woman. And I'm gonna tell you something right now. If there is ever a repeat of yesterday's actions, you will be the one to find a new place.

You think you can wave some empty campaign promises at this old head and then the deed will disappear? Are you people for real? This is the 21st century. You can't go covering up your racist profiling at some playground and the vegetation in the middle of Dark Town and expect it just to go away. - Reverend, please. - Oh no no no no no no no no, don't you please me. Why don't you go out there and please that angry mob? Out there demanding that justice be served? Why don't you please that grieving grandmother who lost her only living relative? That young man is one of the finest of any people I've ever met in my life. - I know that. - Alonzo-- - Don't you Zo me. Don't you dare Zo me! Your time, your time, your time is limited, my brother. All those empty promises, all those campaign promises, all become the same old same old. - Hey, hey hey. Can we just take it down a bit? We all want justice to be served. - Look, it was a dark area, okay? Williams, he just, he couldn't see that it was-- - See what? - That was it a-- - See what? Was it what, was it what? A Black man? That it was a boy. Why don't you explain to me why it was so dark there? Why don't you explain to me why it is that we live in a anti-crime lighting area, in our neighborhood and you never, ever demanded that same lighting in that upscale shopping mall of yours? - I can't. - You know what? It is getting late. We're gonna have to take this up in the morning. - Oh, wait a minute, Your Honor, or is it the senator? You got a fundraiser to get to? Hey look, I'm sorry, I won't be able to make it. What, you two have a late date? - What? I beg your pardon. - I'm afraid that's something you're gonna have to get from the governor's office, and you will, if I have anything to say about it. - Hey, what do you mean? - I mean, I wanna see Williams stand before a jury of his peers. - That is not what you said! - I mean, I wanna see Williams stand before a jury of his peers. And I will do everything I possibly can to make sure that that happens. - Okay, look, look. It's not even up to us. We don't have anything to with whether he stands trial or not. That's up to the CRB or the DA's office. Come on. - I want the Justice Department in on this. This is far beyond our little mean streets here. This is a rights issue, as well as murder. - Actually, we don't know what it is yet, Reverend. That is why it's called an investigation. But I promise you, we will all see justice done here. - Well, congratulations. Looks like you two are going national. That is political speak, isn't it? I'm gonna do everything I can for my people, but you better make sure you do everything you can to keep the peace. That is your job, isn't it? - Yes it is. - Good night.

Now what do you want? - I loved that boy, Fiona, you know. I loved that young man. - Yes, well, your love didn't seem to help him too much. Now did it, TJ? - Please forgive me. I didn't know, I didn't think. - Yes, see, that's just it. No matter how much you say you loved him, when it came down to it you were just a frightened white man with a gun. - Please forgive me. I can't go on this way. - Yes you can. And you will. I do. That beautiful young man that I raised from birth is gone. You took him. But I'm still here. And so are you. I'm sorry, Timothy. - Please. Please. - If I were you, I would walk back across that dark street you've lived in for too long and into that building over there.

But it seems to me you got trouble of your own right now, huh? - You have no idea. - Only what I read. - Yeah, well, you can't believe any of that. - I don't believe anything I read or anything I see on the news. After what they did to my little girl, calling her a whore and everything else, that girl was an angel. She made me breakfast every morning. Her mother passed on, she went to work, she went to school. She is an angel, and I know that she is one. And I don't care what they write about her. - Yeah, listen, Ed, you know, I uh ... I'd like to be able to tell you a lotta things, but we have an ongoing investigation so I really can't. - What are you saying, that she was working with you guys? - Well, let's just say I know she was an innocent that was caught up in a buncha things and, uh-- - And nobody told me anything? - She didn't want us to. She thought you'd be worried. - That's just like her. She's worried about me, and look at where she is now. (exhaling) Jesus God. - So listen, Ed, do you think that I could get into her room maybe and take a look at some of her stuff? - Again? I mean the homicide detectives went through everything there. - They might've missed something. - There's not a lot, but you're welcome to it. Come on. - [TJ] Hey, they missed this. This cameo was out there by the site. - [Ed] I gave her that for her birthday. She told me all her girlfriends were wearing them. - [TJ] Really? - Please, try not to disturb anything. She was always so particular about her room. And I would like to keep it that way for a while. - Yeah, well, I'm not gonna touch anything. I was just looking ... Do you know if she kept a journal or a diary or anything like that? That's what I'm really looking for. - No, she was a very fussy little girl, but all she cared about was these dolls, you know. And she would read to them, she would sing to them, she would have little tea parties with them. I mean, she has a whole closet full of stuff for them. - Can I take a look at that? - Yeah, sure. (soft suspenseful music) - Is this her handwriting? - Yes it is. - Do you mind if I take these? - Well, as long as I get them all back. - Oh yeah, absolutely. - All right, well, be my guest.

That's why I was asking. - Listen, Chief, it's kinda complicated. - But we're getting closer to a theory. - Which we think we can develop into a motive. - Yeah, but things have been getting kinda complicated. - I know all about complications, and you've had your fair share. In fact, I been hearing all kinds of things that I don't wanna be hearing. And none of the things that I do wanna be hearing. (elevator dinging) Hey, Sue. - Hey, Chief. - How are you? - [Sue] We're going up. - Thank you. Let me give a little advice to both of you. Until I hear everything that I want to be hearing, I do not want to hear anything more about what I don't want to know. Clear? - Yes. - We're crystal clear, Chief. - Good. I'm going up. Okay, see you guys, have a nice day. Sue, you look lovely. I went golfing today. - [Angel] Look, don't be a wise-ass, all right. I got the scoop on you from Fran. She told me you teed off on TJ. - What's with you? The way you were talking about him the other day, it didn't sound like you gave a shit if you saw his ugly ass again or not. (groaning) (punch striking) - Hey, Tommy. Tommy, come on, man. Come on. That's a boy. How you doing? You all right? Yeah? (punch striking) - Hey. - Hey, how you doing, buddy? - Have you seen some keys? No? Ugh, man. - Hey, got a live one for you over here. Just kidding, you know. Ooh. (stretcher rattling) Oh yeah. Bye (laughs). - You really are fucking crazy. What are you doing here? - What? Oh wait, where were we? I could give a rat's ass about my ex-partner. What are you doing looking at my ass. - Look, whatever, look look. You know what it is, all right. We gotta get you out of here. - No, no no, I gotta get you into the evidence locker. No, I got some evidence. I gotta make a match. - Whoa whoa whoa, what evidence and what match? - No, I need the contents of Lufkin's stomach and her booty shorts. - What kind of a sick pervo are you? - What? No, man. I think the guy was involved with the Lufkin girl. - How involved? - I have no idea. That's why I need the evidence. Just go in there and get it for me, we'll be good. Come on, man. I'm counting on you. Come on. - All right, all right, all right, all right. Look, look, but we have to get you out of here now. - No, I'll get outta here. - No no no, now, TJ. Now. - Okay, okay, look, just go in there and get the stuff and then get in touch with me, all right. Don't hang me up. - Wait, wait wait, what about Tommy? - Sounds like a personal problem to me. - We were talking, and it's hard. - Yeah, I don't know what to say to him. Probably because every time I try to talk to him he's wasted. - Yeah, he's going through some rough stuff right now, you know. I mean, retiring's hard enough. When my dad got retired, he was wacky. And he wasn't dealing with anything like your dad's been going through. - Well, I'm gonna take some of it off him tonight. - What? What do you mean? - I mean it's payback time. - What are you talking about? - It wasn't Dad's fault that Billy got killed. Well not really, but I know whose it was. - Who was it? Why are you still talking about that girl? - You know, it's none of your business. - Did you go out with her or something? - I said it's none of your business. - Let the police do their thing. - Yeah, Carl's right, Kyle. Don't be stupid. - Yeah, right. - Okay, you know, who is it? Maybe we can help too. - You guys have no idea what's going on. (cellphone ringing) Yeah, hello. All right, I'll be there, 20 minutes, all right. - Who was that? - None of your business. - Okay. - [Kyle] All right, I gotta go. - Hey, where are you going? - Listen, if you hear from Mom, tell her not to wait up, all right? - Come on, Kyle. - Tonight's for Billy and Bonnie, all right. If you hear from Dad, tell him I've got the guy. - Kyle. - Is he serious? - I don't know. Do you think we should go follow him? - No, no. I'll go, you stay, in case your mom calls. - No, are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, I'm gonna call some of his friends. - Okay. (soft upbeat music) - Oh hey hey hey, Judge Danforth. What a coincidence, huh (laughs)? - What do you think you're doing? - Oh, just having a little chat here in a very public place with some very lovely young people. Who are these people? Garrett Danforth. - Ah, TJ Williams. - This is my son, Detective. - Uh-oh, are you a cop? - No, not any longer. Isn't that right, Mr. Williams? - Well, not quite yet. And you are? - Debbie. - Debbie. - This is my niece, Garrett's cousin. Correct? - Yeah, that's right. Kissing cousin. - It's getting a little late. I got some unfinished business I need to take care of. You and Cousin Deb will have to carry on without me. Mr. Williams, it was a pleasure. - Yeah. Maybe some other time, huh? - Maybe. - [TJ] Nice kid. - Do you think so? - Yeah, he's a real chip. - Now don't be bitter, dear. He takes after his mother, I'm afraid. - Oh yeah. Family relations, I completely understand. - What can I do for you, Mr. Williams? - Actually, Judge, it's more about what I can do for you. - Really? - Really. - Will you gentlemen excuse me? I think I need to freshen up my powder. Like my necklace, things like that. - What kinda powder would that be? - Your Honor, if you don't mind. - Certainly, my dear. Hurry back, though, I promised your mother. - All right. Forgot about mommy dearest. Detective, it was a pleasure. I sure hope I won't be seeing you again. Ta-ta. - Ta-ta. - Boy, they get old a lot younger these days, don't they? - I beg your pardon. - You heard me. - I suppose so. - Oh right, you'd know more about that than I would. You spend all that time with them. - I'm afraid I do. Unfortunately, very few are as nice and as well trained as my niece. - What about Bonnie Lufkin? Was she well trained? - What'd you just say? I thought you were on suspension. It was my understanding that you were taken off the roster of the department. - I'm doing a little independent research project. - Yeah, well, I suggest you stop immediately, as in cease and desist. Otherwise, I can't be held responsible for complications that may come up in your case. - I found a diary of Bonnie's with your name all over it. And I did some forensics on her stomach contents and panties. What do you think I might find if I were to do a DNA match on you? - I have no idea. The girl was a prostitute. - The girl was somebody's daughter, you son of a bitch, just like this one, your niece, is it? - I think you better go. - I know you wanna help here, because you're a good civil servant. You do wanna help, right? I know what you've been doing, and I know you got a partner or partners, and I want them more than I want you, so I'm gonna make you a deal. You know, I know they're the business end of your business. So you think about that. - Is there a problem, Your Honor? - No. Our guest here is about to exit. Isn't that right, Mr. Williams? - Yeah. (chuckles) Thanks. Have a nice night. (vehicle approaching) (upbeat rock music on radio) (whistling) - Hold him. Hold him. (punches striking) (punches striking) (exhaling) (exhaling) Hey, guy. Listen, um, if you feel like talking, just make sure it has nothing to do with me, okay? If I hear you said anything about me, I'll finish this off. And then I'm gonna go after your family. I'm gonna go after your dad. I'm gonna go after your mom. And I got something really, really special planned for your sister. So, uh, figured I'd just let you know. Anyway, sleep tight. (vehicle passing) (engine starting) (upbeat dramatic music) - Hello. Yeah, yeah, there's an emergency. ♪ You got nowhere to go ♪ ♪ And nowhere left to turn ♪ - What the hell is going on? - I don't know, Your Honor. I'll check it out, stay put. Is there a problem? (punch striking) - Oh, hey, Judge Danforth. Is that how you treat all your young relatives? - Oh my God, girl, get up. - Oh, you have a video too? How do you want me? - No, you stupid bitch. That's not what it's for. - Okay, I think we've got about enough here. Why don't you come on with me, Hot Pants? Come on, honey. Come on, that's right. You take care, Judge. - Bye. (upbeat music) Bye, I love you. (upbeat dramatic music) (tires squealing) - Who the hell did this? - Hey, take it easy. - Mom, Dad, look. - Hey hey hey, buddy boy. Hey, hey. Who did this to you? - It was Danforth that killed Bonnie. - Yeah, yeah, I know that, and I know about you and Bonnie, too, and I'm sorry, Son. I'm really sorry. But who did this? - You gotta get him. - Oh, I will. Look, I was just with the judge, okay. I was just with the judge, and he couldn't have been the issue, Son. Hey, hey hey hey, don't go on me now, come on. Hey, hey, come on, don't bail out on me now. Dammit. (monitor beeping) - TJ, wait, come back here. Where are you going? - Mom. - Sh, sh. Please, this is a hospital, okay. - I don't care. Where are you going? - I got some unfinished business that I gotta take care of. - Unfinished business? You've always got unfinished business. What about your unfinished family, huh? What about us? What about the unfinished business you take care of when you run to work every day, huh? Where are you going (cries)? - Sh, sh, come on, come on. Listen, what's that thing you always say? What is it? Sorry, please forgive me. Thank you, I love you. Come on, say it with me, say it with me. Come on, come on. - Get, you bastard! - If I don't do, ah ... Can't you please just go and explain to her? - Dad, I'll take care of Mom. Just do what you need to do. We'll be okay. - Thanks, I love you, baby doll. - [Peggy] I love you too. Mom? (exhaling) - You having fun yet? - Is there anything else I can do? - Yeah, you know. You could, uh, you know, just stick around, you know, make sure things are okay. Keep an eye on them. I'd really appreciate it. Hey, thanks, uh ... - Carl. - Carl. Thanks, Carl. - No problem. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Santangelo. - Angel. - Hey, where are you, man? I been calling all around. - I'm at the hospital, and they got my kid. - Kyle? - [TJ] Yeah, he's pretty messed up. - Shit. Where's Doris, is she all right? - She's not taking it too well. - TJ, the reason I ask, man, Evie's missing. - [TJ] What do you mean she's missing? - I mean she's missing, man, as in she aint around. - [TJ] Tell me. - I went over to the diner to pick her up, and she's gone. First I started thinking. - Hello. - Hey look, man, I got all kinda crazy shit going on in my mind. - Yeah, well knock that shit off. - Anyway, look, I found this note for you. - To me? - Detective Williams, I have your wife. You know what to do. - Oh, man. Okay, listen, get a couple of guys over to cover my family, and then you get over to Danforth's office and make sure he doesn't leave. I think he's gonna be packing up his desk. Don't let him go. - Whoa whoa whoa, Danforth, what about Evie? - Hey, I think I know where she is. Just do what I'm asking. - All right, all right, fine. But listen, man, I really hope you know what you're doing on this one. - Hey. - I'm there. Lenny, Tommy, get to the hospital and get a cover on Doris Williams. - Williams? - Where do you think you're going, Santangelo? What's up? - Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry. - [Gina] A bit? - Cap, you don't understand. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Enlighten me. - Look, Gina. - Captain. - Captain, TJ's onto something. - Onto something or on something? - You need to be with us on this one. - I'm giving you one hour, that's it. Then I'm coming after you personally. - Thank you. All right, thank you. What the hell you guys waiting for? - Waiting for you, asshole. - [Angel] You want another black eye? - Don't worry about her. Back me up. - Hey, you can't go in there. Bailiff! Bailiff! Bailiff! (upbeat rock music) - Hey, Judge. - Detective, I've got an arrest warrant for this man. - Let me see this thing. - Certainly. - Looks almost in order. - Well? - No signature. - Ooh, must run in the family. Where's your son, Judge? Where's Garrett? - I don't know. And I wouldn't tell you if I did. - Oh, okay. Let's see, obstruction of justice, failure to comply with an ongoing investigation. Aiding and abetting a suspected felon in flight. Yeah, does that just about sum it up, doesn't it? Yeah, I guess it does. - Seems to me like your son is in a world of shit. - Okay, what's the deal? - (laughs) There are no deals, Judge. Come on, you know that. (soft dramatic music) (device beeping) (soft dramatic music) - See, I, uh, I didn't really ever have a mom. She left when I was eight. I just came home one day from school and she was gone. I mean, can you imagine that? I'm sure you couldn't. I mean, what self-respecting woman would, whatever, stick around while, while her husband penetrates their child with his dirty little digits? Yeah. (Eve moaning) Why would you leave your kid behind, Mrs. Danforth? There's a question you may ask. And I'd let you if I could. I'd like to know the answer to that question, and I think the answer is, to save your own worthless ass. - Okay. - See, if she woulda stayed, he woulda killed her (imitates gun firing). - I'm going in, solo, unarmed, just like he said he wanted. - And, if she would have come back, honestly, I would have killed her. - If I'm not out in five minutes, you come in and get me. You got that? - Why, why couldn't I go with you? Why couldn't I go with you, Mom? If I coulda gone, I wouldn't be in the shit that I'm in now. - [TJ] Hey, absolutely no radios. Yet get that? No radios. - You just close your eyes and you can turn your head, and then all of this just disappears. And I'm just sitting in Santa's lap, and it's Christmas day. Merry Christmas (cries). (soft dramatic music) Oh. How rude. We have a guest. (soft suspenseful music) - Hey, baby, I always knew you were a little bit kinky, but this is taking it a little bit far, don't you think? (soft suspenseful music) This is kinda new for you, isn't it? There. - Look out, oh my God. Oh my God! - I'm going in. - You're not going anywhere. - Listen, you pathetic moron. I'm not his wife! I'm not even his girlfriend. You've got the wrong girl, freak. So why don't you just let me go, okay? What do you say? - Did you hear that, Dick (laughs)? Your wife doesn't even want you anymore. - Yeah, well, that may be true, but she aint my wife. - [Garrett] That's why you risked your ass to save her life? - I didn't say she was nothing to me. She's my friend. You screwed the pooch on this one, Sonny. - You're lying to me. You're a liar. - No, man, I don't know you well enough to lie to you. I could lie to her. - Why are you doing this? - Why? This is how I get my rocks off. - Nice-looking kid like you, with your connections? (laughing) - Yeah, I guess you could say I got connections up the ass. Fuck! (groaning) (soft suspenseful music) Oh, so what now, super cop? - Well, let's see. My wife's not speaking to me. My friends and family all hate me. All because of you and your dad. - He's got a bomb! - What? - What? - He's got a bomb! - Yeah, I could probably do this. (laughing) Why don't you help us nail him? - You know he used to have me and my friends come up for a good time. They weren't my friends. They were just poor, abused kids that ended up in his courts. Before my mom left, she gave me a video camera, so I got a pretty good collection. Never imagine who the star is. - Let me guess. - Dear old Dad. - Yeah, well, you know, we all got problems, kid. - Yeah, but mine are about to end. - Hey, they don't have to end like this. - You recognize this? It's Bonnie's phone. She was calling you when I went back to make sure that this didn't end up in your hands. And you think I could just give up, huh? I coulda had you all. You think you're better than me. So fuck it. (bomb exploding) (soft music) (siren blaring in distance) (soft music) - [TJ] Well, that about does it for me. Naw, wait a minute. Hey, wait a minute. A few quick notes. As it turns out, this Garrett Danforth kid may have been pretty sharp as a dealer and a pimp, but he couldn't quite cut it as a bomber. You know what I mean? Anyway. (upbeat music and vocalizing) Couple weeks later, Angel and Eve got married. It was his second. It was her third. And after a less-than-perfect start, they had a really nice honeymoon. Good luck, you two. Her Honor, and I use the term loosely, and the chief got caught stroking it out of bounds on the 19th hole. - Fore! - [TJ] Needless to say, they both lost their respective bids for office and are currently unemployed. Way to go, tigers. After being shafted again by the administration, the Reverend Alonzo Sparks was elected mayor with a landslide write-in vote, can you dig it? About a month later, the whole gang got together and threw a little shindig for Doris and me. Oh by the way, Gina Bascom was elected police chief. You go, girl. My daughter and Carl got engaged. Nice couple. Kyle fully recovered, and started dating Debbie, seriously. You all remember Debbie, right? Nice girl. Lucky guy. (upbeat music) Ooh, the honeymoon is definitely over. As for me, I thank God every single day that kid didn't know what he was doing. I pray for forgiveness for the deaths of Billy Taylor and Bonnie Lufkin. I probably will for the rest of my life. But, I was cleared of all charges. And I quietly retired with honors from the force. At that celebration, I asked my bride of 25 years to marry me again. After about five minutes, she actually said yes. I am so blessed. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. The judge and his kid. - The former jurist's son's video collection sealed his fate. He is now serving five consecutive terms of 20 years each with no possibility of parole. We all wish you luck in those showers, Judge Danforth. There's nothing like Sing-Singing in the Rain. Although charged with 15 felony counts ranging from murder to drug trafficking to enlisting minors for the purpose of promoting prostitution, Garrett Danforth has been remanded to the state facility for the criminally insane for a period of not less than 20 years nor more than his natural life.
