Did ice age people, thousands of years before Columbus and the Vikings, make an epic journey to cross a freezing Atlantic ocean... This is a very different concept of where people may have come from. To become the first humans in America, far earlier than anyone thought... These people were here, and they were here in great numbers. Encountering a vast new continent and its fearful creatures. It's a radically controversial idea. It's a romantic story, but it doesn't hold up to the evidence. Romance, or a breathtaking new reality? A 20,000-year-old mystery in a terrifying world of ice. North America, 20,000 years ago. An ice age wilderness where beasts rule. The short-faced bear... The American cave lion... The giant sloth. But no humans. Or so we have long thought. In 2012, on an island off the east coast of Maryland, a team of archaeologists found something that astonished them. It was a stone spear point sticking out of a layer of coastal cliff. Archaeologist Dennis Stanford analyzed the find. He immediately saw its unusual features. This is a biface, uh, very thin, it's been resharpened a couple times, with about this much of it sticking out of the bank. Biface meant the stone point had been sharpened on both sides... Evidence of an ancient people capable of making sophisticated tools. And it was not the only one. And here's another biface. We have done some blood residue analysis on this artifact, and as it turns out, it's got buffalo blood on it. Both of these were coming out of that soil horizon, the very surface of it. The chesapeake site turned out to be a treasure trove. Bifaces, projectile points, blades. 17 individual finds in all. But most exciting was the date. Local archaeologists calculated that the soil layer the spear point was found in was around 20,000 years old. Dennis Stanford believed this allowed him to date the stone tools and weapons as well. What's really exciting and really interesting about these new finds we're making here on the chesapeake is that they're around 20,000 years old. If this dating turned out to be true, they were here in chesapeake bay around 5,000 years earlier than humans are supposed to have arrived in America. It challenged everything we thought we knew about the first native Americans... Who they were, where they came from, how they got here, and when they arrived. The long-accepted theory is that the first Americans traveled on foot across beringia, a bridge of land... Now the Bering strait... That once connected Asia to North America. What we believe is that native Americans entered the continent sometime maybe around 15,000, 16,000 years ago, and that the first migration must have been along the west coast because we have native Americans down in South America, quite far, about 15,000 years ago. The 2012 chesapeake discoveries, if confirmed, would mean a much earlier migration on a completely different route. What's changed is we now have things that are 6,000 years older on the eastern side of North America. Now, this doesn't work at all with the old theory. From there comes the obvious question... Where did these people come from? For Bruce Bradley, himself an expert re-creator of ancient stone tools and weapons, the origin of these 20,000-year-old tool makers became a worldwide quest. But instead of looking west... The traditionally accepted route... He looked east, straight across the Atlantic from the chesapeake bay. A cave in the pyrenees mountains on the borders of today's France and Spain. 20,000 years ago. The ice age. Home to a people of enormous ingenuity... The solutreans. They were primarily hunters. We know that they were hunting reindeer, sometimes horses. They developed what we call a spear thrower, which has an incredible advantage in terms of velocity and killing power than from the hand. If you do that with a spear thrower, it's up to 100 times more force. The tools they made are what define their culture today. They innovated a lot of different things that we see as technologies that the other people didn't do. One of the innovations is a needle that has an eye in it. The development of an eye needle makes sewing much more efficient. That's something that becomes very dominant and widespread after that development. The eyed needle allowed solutreans to make finely stitched clothing... Essential for warmth in an ice age. The solutreans lived 4,000 miles and an ocean away from the chesapeake, around 22,000 to 17,000 years ago. We still don't know why they died out, but their mastery of this long-ago world depended on one thing above all others... Manufacturing the stone weapons that allowed them to hunt and kill. If you say the word solutrean to an archaeologist, this is the tool that often comes to mind, this bi-pointed knife-like tool. What's often extremely respected is to have something this long and wide that's this thin. The solutreans' unique innovation was what is now known as overshot flaking. They struck stone with incredible precision, causing fractures that fan out from the point of impact. They endlessly repeated this to create a leaf-shaped weapon sharper and thinner than any before. For Bruce Bradley and Dennis Stanford, the solutrean tools were a revelation. The similarities with the finds in the chesapeake bay seemed overwhelming. This is a cast of a solutrean biface, and this is one from the chesapeake. They match in terms of shape, method of manufacture, size, and use. And we're getting a lot of these artifacts. Yeah, this projectile point, it's a broken base from the chesapeake, and this is one from France. Actually, look at that. They're almost identical. And that was a conundrum. You know, what in the heck is going on here? Could this happen accidentally? We argue no, absolutely it couldn't be unrelated. Stanford and Bradley had found a match. But it seemed to defy logic. Simple geography means the solutreans could only have traveled to America from the wrong direction, arriving not on its west coast but its east. That would mean ice age people succeeded in crossing the Atlantic many thousands of years before the Vikings and Columbus. Why would they even attempt such a dangerous journey? The solutrean hunting grounds in this ice world were full of menace and competition. Starvation threatened both humans and animals. Could it be that the nearby ocean and ice, with their potential harvest of fish and seabirds, were not a threat, but an opportunity? And that a single step into that ocean eventually led to a new world 4,000 miles away? Solutrean people, like many other people in the world, wouldn't just sit around and get either conquered or die out from starvation. They're going to, like the rest of us, have that drive to survive. And to survive, they would not need to cross an open ocean. The ice age formed a 1,200-mile bridge between the continents. So, Dennis Stanford and I came up with this hypothesis that people came across the North Atlantic about 20,000 years ago. The solutreans could have traveled west across the ice bridge or along the edge of the ice from Europe to North America. And established themselves here. This is a very different concept of where people may have come from. Announcing this idea put Stanford and Bradley out on a serious limb. They met a chorus of opposition from mainstream archaeologists. First, said the critics, the chesapeake bay site was too messy to prove anything. What we have is just the harvesting of artifacts from a cut bank surface or artifacts that have already fallen, you know, out of that cliff surface. Then another chorus of mainstream geneticists voiced its disapproval. Every line of evidence from every field is supporting the model that people came here from beringia, not Europe. Above all, the whole idea of a transatlantic ice crossing seemed preposterous. There is no evidence whatsoever for boats or early use of boats. It was an idea that could change human history. But no one believed them. Five years later, they return to the chesapeake bay, determined to confound the critics and show that a supposedly impossible journey really happened. Southwest France, 20,000 years ago. A cave once lived in by a group of families from a people called solutreans. A people who, according to a revolutionary idea posed by two archaeologists, will cross the Atlantic to become the first native Americans. The solutrean people were really quite advanced. They did cave art. Primarily they were illustrating animals, but sometimes just handprints. Dennis Stanford's collaborator, Bruce Bradley, joins land-owner joelle darricau inside isturitz cave to see an astonishing piece of ancient art. This is just phenomenal. It's overwhelming. Bradley needs evidence that the solutreans might have been more than just forest hunters. Wow, that's incredible. A fish associated with deer. That's really interesting. In many cultures, salmon are very special because they live both in the sea and in the rivers. It might indicate a connection with the ocean. It's the first link between the solutreans and the sea. But you don't need to cross an ocean to fish for salmon. Another solutrean cave, on the south coast of France, holds an even stronger clue. It's a painting of a giant sea bird called the great auk. The great auk was a beautiful bird. I mean, it was a large bird. You know, weighed about 10 pounds. It would have been this big. It had a white spot on the forehead, and it had this beautiful black sheath over its bill. The great auk was 30 inches tall and could swim, but not fly. For an ice hunter, it was the perfect prey. The great auk has a huge breast muscle, you know, on a 10-pound bird, so probably something like having a 10-pound Turkey. It has a lot of oil... The same as a seal would. So it's probably very nutritious food. Auks were good swimmers but clumsy on land. And despite appearances, no relation to the penguin. They were hunted to extinction in the 19th century. But during solutrean times, their abundance made them irresistible... Worth venturing far into the ocean to hunt. There were a lot of them, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. It would be like a bird city. It's the density that's overwhelming. You'd be awestruck. How could you not see this massive grocery store out there on the edge of the ice and not say, okay, it's worth the risk? All you got to do is follow the food. I turn the question around all the time. Not why would they; why wouldn't they? As they ventured farther and farther out, were the solutreans also headed to the coast of a new continent? Five years after finding the tools that match solutrean technology, the team of archaeologists returns to the chesapeake bay, determined to answer their critics. The vast majority of archaeologists in both the new world and the old world do not accept that people crossed the North Atlantic. You need solid, unequivocal evidence to make any kind of interpretation. To prove the skeptics wrong, they need to find this irrefutable evidence... Fragments of boats the solutreans crossed in, or encampments they lived in before any other humans came to America. But the team is in a race against time. Every day, the eroding cliffs are slipping away. And so that in itself... Watch out, guys. Wow. - Oh, my gosh. - Are you okay? I think everybody needs to stay away from the wall. Just the vibration of it... I can see cracking in here. Will they find the evidence they need, or will their theory be washed away? The chesapeake bay, 2017. A team of archaeologists races to find proof that the first Americans came not from Asia, but from Europe... Across thousands of miles of freezing ocean. The problem is that the main evidence for their theory is stone tools, and stone cannot be dated. What can be dated, by radiocarbon, is charcoal... The remains of wood burned by humans. And that means finding a fire-pit... What archeologists call a hearth. Finding a hearth is really important because we don't know where that charcoal actually came from, whether it was flowed in, blown in. What we want to find is where we know whoever made this artifact sat there and cooked a meal and baked the ground and burned up wood. If we get the radio-carbon date and tools in place with the hearth, they're going to have a real hard time denying it. And that's going to happen, 'cause these people were here, and they were here in great numbers. But the same erosion that exposed the evidence is also threatening it. Every year, over 300 feet of shoreline disappears into the bay. This new high tide that's coming in right now is going to dissolve a lot of that soil that could contain artifacts. And if there is a 20,000-year-old occupation here, we hope it hasn't been destroyed by coastal erosion. We've got a serious offshore breeze right now that reversed the tide. It looks like it's coming in even harder right now with bigger waves. 20,000 years ago, this ocean, stretching thousands of miles east, looked completely different. The sea level is 400 feet lower, and the shoreline stretches many miles farther out. Ice spans the Atlantic, but it isn't solid. Ice islands, some several miles wide, shift and crack with the ocean currents. It's the biggest obstacle to their theory so far. The solutreans could not just have walked across the ice to America. Dennis Stanford sees a parallel with the native American inuit people, who arrived in the arctic thousands of years ago. I had worked in Alaska with inuit hunters. I've been out on the ice. And I'd see these huge ice islands, and I'm thinking, now how... You know, those solutrean guys, maybe they had boats. There's no evidence that solutrean people had boats. We don't have a boat, we don't have any tools that show the boats were made, any solid evidence of boat transport. My critics would say, well, you have no evidence that they had boats. Well, you know, where are we going to get that evidence? Because if they had boats, they're using those boats on the ocean, and the ocean that they were on is now 250 meters underwater. The world's oldest physical evidence of boats are wooden paddles found in Western Europe, dating back 9,500 years. But new evidence from an archaeological dig in Australia suggests humans arrived there 65,000 years ago from islands in Indonesia. They could only have come by boat. So if you think about boats, most boats are made out of wood, skin, organic materials that do not preserve over time. We don't have the boats, but we have people in Australia. So we know, unless you want to put them in hot air balloons to get there, then watercraft was involved. We think that easily goes back 20,000 years to the solutrean times. If they had a boat, then they'd be in good shape for getting around the ice. And if you have a boat, you know how to deal with rough water. A picture builds of how the epic trans-Atlantic crossing 20,000 years ago might have happened. The solutreans venture ever farther into the ocean in search of food, surviving on auks, seals, and fish. They live and travel in a boat just like the inuit one, called an umiak. Somewhere out on the ice, they reach the point of no return. If you're going to really be moving a whole group, like an extended family, multiple extended families, you need a cargo carrier. You need like the suv of the day to carry the family in. And that would be the umiak, and that's the way they used it. You can fill that up with a lot of equipment, a lot of people, you can pull that up on the ice, turn it on its side, and use it as a weather break. We landlubbers think of the ocean as a threat, but people that live on the ocean and use the ocean think of it as a highway. We know historically that the ocean was the way people migrate. Without hard evidence, it could still just all be romance, not reality. But there's one even more intriguing piece to the puzzle. Could the solutreans have left behind genetic traces in people who still live in North America? Could an ancient people called the solutreans have been lured by the bounty of the sea... And survived a journey across the frozen Atlantic? If they did arrive on the shores of North America, perhaps genetic evidence could prove it. There's an indigenous group in eastern Canada with an unusual and intriguing origin story. They're called the huron-wendat. We have a legend that is saying that the huron-wendat came from the east, from the great salted lake, from a mountain, a cave, from the Atlantic. Dr. Louis lesage has come to england to see if there is any truth in the legend. We have questions, and we want answers. We are curious to know the life and times of our ancestors. The box contains 40 teeth... Exhumed remains from Dr. Lesage's ancestors, buried before Columbus first came to America. These remains are sacred. Genetic work like this is almost never permitted. But the huron-wendat council has made a rare exception. It's quite something to know that it's my ancestors that are in this little box. And please don't call them samples. They are not samples; They are individuals. That's important. It's your responsibility to take care of them. We're very honored and grateful in the trust that the huron-wendat have put in us to do this work. If these North American teeth contain genetic markers prevalent in Europe 20,000 years ago, they could rewrite history. This project will look directly at the ancient and modern DNA of first nations populations and test the possibility that some of their ancient DNA actually came directly across the Atlantic. Oppenheimer's team is looking for a small genetic marker called x2a. X2a is part of an ancient gene group called "x". It's found in the middle east, Europe, and North America... But not east Asia. If the teeth have x2a markers, Oppenheimer believes it will be clear evidence that people carrying x came over before Columbus, across the Atlantic. It was clear to me, just, just looking at the, at the map, that the most obvious route is across the Atlantic. Oppenheimer's team will spend the next three months searching for evidence of x2a and proof that the earliest migration into North America came from the east. If the solutreans did make this epic journey, it would have been one of humanity's great achievements. Freezing winds blowing from west to east pick up their numbing chill from the 2.5-mile-thick ice sheet covering Canada. By the time the winds reach the sea, the average temperature is minus 31 degrees fahrenheit. Winter is extreme... The harshest time to survive. Even more treacherous as the seasons change is shifting and rolling pack ice. There's one consolation. The journey is not as long as you might think. Our critics constantly say 4,000 miles. Well, it's not. Look at the ocean and the sea ice at that point in time and what's exposed. Today, 3,500 miles of Atlantic ocean separate Europe and North America. But 20,000 years ago, massive ice sheets have locked up so much water that the sea level is over 400 feet lower. The continental shelves are dry land, cutting the sea journey in half. That's still a long way, but for inuit people that wasn't a big deal to go 1,500 miles across the North of Canada. Assume 15 miles a day. Just a hundred days across the sea and ice islands. Just over three months from land on one side to land on the other. Difficult, but not impossible. People are remarkable. We, you know, we're so smart. Well, they were that smart, too. There's no shortage of food. Oil is fat. And you can render it out of animals, seals in particular, and the great auk. You just need it for everything. For light, you'd have oil lamps, for heat, for protection. And the best places to get the oil was on the ocean, on the ice. That's where the major sources are. And you can live out there all year round. If you're out there hunting and camped out, you can take a boat and go back to land, or you can continue on with the ice. Pretty soon you just keep moving, and you might end up on the continental shelf of North America. Could the solutreans, perhaps by accident, have reached American land and made their way south to the chesapeake, bringing all their know-how with them? Did they leave any footprint behind? The team is on day five of the dig. This is no longer about finding things on the surface. They're cutting right into the cliff face, going ever lower and older, slice by slice. Well, we're about that close, and that's really exciting because this is the layer we need to be in. And hopefully we'll find some evidence of cultural occupation in this level that we're coming on down to now. Dennis, I think we've got a small piece of charcoal in the occupation level in here. - Oh, great! - Yeah, it's great. Fantastic. Yeah, it's pretty exciting. Charcoal is a good sign, but not enough. They need to find evidence of human-made tools and a hearth on the same level. I think that this looks like charcoal right here. You see that black speck right there. But it's very exciting because we're coming down on charcoal. Yay! We can get a radio-carbon age for this and if we're lucky, maybe we'll find stone flakes to go along with that, little stone artifacts. If the solutreans did come here 20,000 years ago, what kind of place did they find? What terrors did it hold? The chesapeake bay, 20,000 years ago. Imagine the first solutreans, the first ever humans in America, exploring their new land. When you landed here, you'd be in front of an ice age environment, which is what you were in front of at home. You know exactly how to adapt to it. Their first task is to find stones to make the tools and weapons on which their survival depends. Pretty soon they begin to understand where they are. It's pretty good because nobody else has been there before and there's lots of stuff. They would have encountered new animals... Animals that had never seen people before. The solutreans' new home, this great canopy of icy wilderness, contains unimagined sights and creatures. As they enter the forest for their first hunt, shocks await. They don't yet know it, but this is a land of massive prehistoric mammals unlike any in ice age Europe. Among them, one of the most terrifying predators of all time, the short-faced bear... Capable of chasing its prey at 25 miles an hour... And rearing up to heights of 13 feet. It would have been a challenge, but I think that challenge would have been met by slowly adjusting to the new way, behavior of those animals. Another shock is in store. The bizarre sight of a giant ground sloth. It stands over 10 feet tall. Only the weapons the solutreans have invented will save them. It's hard to believe that such terrifying encounters once happened here. The team is now slicing through a 20,000-year-old layer of dirt to try to show that they did. We're working really, really slowly now, we're really just peeling off, peeling off little layers one at a time, and really keeping our eye out for anything indicative, whether it's artifacts or charcoal. In addition to their stone tools and weapons, there's one more thing the solutreans might have left behind... A genetic trace. After months of testing, the results are in, and they're astonishing. Dr. Oppenheimer's team has discovered that three of the ancient huron-wendat teeth contain traces of the genetic marker x2a. We have found evidence that x2a was present before Columbus. Yeah. That's very interesting. It's not something which came over with Columbus. Yup. We can say, for those who have the x2a, it's likely that their ancestors came from across the Atlantic. The evidence is there. They came from the ocean, the, the... Or from the east. These new findings about the x2a genes is very fascinating, the way that we can put it in parallel to the legend of the arrival of the huron-wendat. It just blew out our previous conception of the colonization of North America. If it's true, Dr. Lesage himself may be related to the ice age solutreans who made this epic journey. These kind of results help us, brick by brick, to construct our history. Who were we exactly? For me, I'm proud to say that my ancestors help all of us to better understand our common history. But not all geneticists agree with this interpretation. Oppenheimer is arguing from one single genetic marker. We cannot explain the peopling of the Americas based on one piece of data. It has to be supported by multiple lines of evidence, or it's not a good model. And currently the best model we have is people came here from beringia, not from Europe. The debate is far from over, and for many, the idea of this epic journey is still hard to believe. The solutreans lived between 22,000 and 17,000 years ago. If they did reach America, how many of them were there? In more recent times, once Columbus proved the journey was possible, Europeans swept into the new world. Did solutreans come and go, too? We're not talking about migration. We're talking about expanding territory to the point where they became knowledgeable of both ends. So they're tethered on land at both ends and using the middle as the grocery store. Some stayed, some went back, they brought their technology with them, and we're finding that technology on the chesapeake bay. This is it, I'll tell you. Alrighty, here we go. Yay! We're starting to see charcoal, and it's in relatively large pieces. Wow, that's a lot of charcoal in here. That's really neat. 12 weeks after the dig ends, the results of the charcoal carbon-dating arrive. Three samples fall just inside the beginning of the solutrean era. But the archaeologists don't manage to find the crucial hearth that would prove there was human habitation. On the very last day of the dig, another find reinforces their faith. What have you got? It's lovely because it's made out of the quartzite that we're finding all the flakes from. Look at it! Ooooh! Isn't that neat? A complete biface. The last day. It's the point of the last day. Dennis Stanford and Bruce Bradley remain sure that one day, the final proof will come that 20,000 years ago, the solutreans did cross the Atlantic ice bridge in one of the greatest human journeys of all time. They're not going to give up, even if they have to get there on their own. A young archaeologist in the future will be taught a different story based on the work that we've been doing, because we're changing the history of the world.
