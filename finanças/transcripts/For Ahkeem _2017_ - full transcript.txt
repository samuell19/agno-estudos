Mum... It's time. Don't be afraid. I'm always scared and afraid. You is? Yeah. I just don't know what they gonna say. Come on, Boonie. Do y'all hear that bus? Yep, it's right there. I'm so nervous man, I swear to God. Are you nervous? I just don't want them to put me out of school. The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. - Amen. - Amen. All rise. You may be seated. Daje Shelton, come up here please. You standing in my courtroom, in an adult courtroom and I'm getting ready to make a decision about your life. And if I decide to lock you up your mama can't even make a bond for you. But you want to fight. Because somebody said something about you. How silly is that? How old are you now? Seventeen. - What grade are you in? - 11th. Alright. This is serious. You won't be able to go to another public school in the state of Missouri. What? That's where we are. So her grades and attendance don't count for anything? Her grades and attendance mean a whole lot to me. And you're not even a bad kid. That's what I'm saying, so why... I know you're not a bad kid. And that's the reason I opened the school. I'ma recommend that you go to ICA a high school for people that have these chronic problems of getting in fights. ICA is the only option that the school board really has in terms of me dealing with these types of offenses. I ain't... I don't need that. I'm alright. That's the only option to get your high school diploma. - Can I please say something? - Yes, ma'am. I will make sure that she do what she supposed to do if you would please have mercy on her. No more options. No more options. There are zero options left. Either you make it with me or you don't make it at all. I ain't never been this mad in my life, straight up. I'm hella mad. What college finna accept me from an alternative school? You can go to college off a GED. You smart enough to get that much just like that. I don't... a GED is different from a high school diploma. What job I'ma get with that? What college I'ma go to with that? I care about school. I don't care about this little stupid stuff. I don't have time to instigate. I'm a junior. I'm a junior! I'm finna be a senior next year Y'all think I got time to be doing all that? No. - You supposed to go on about your business. - I mean, Mama, come on, Mama. That ain't enough to keep me in no school like that. Ain't no other school for you to go to. I know you don't want to grow up around here. Don't go in there with no attitude. Go in there like you got some sense 'cause they not playing. They already got everything they need. He a judge. He a principal. And they can shoot you down real quick. Tell you you gotta go to juvenile. - And what am I gonna do? - Uh-uh, I ain't going to juvenile. They can do whatever they want to do. So you go in there mouthing off, and he get mad enough to where "Oh, you too smart. Well, here you go, juvenile." You know what I'm saying? You don't need none of that. We don't need none of that in our life right now. October 10, 2013. They had a whole courtroom in there. My mama was crying. I just felt like I was letting her down 'cause I got to go to an alternative school. She did everything she could for me. I just want to make her proud. Good morning. Don't ever do that again, you hear me? You hear me? Okay. Alright, let's go. Let's go, sweetheart. You ain't got time. You got less than three minutes now. And you want to wait and talk. My class, lets go, in this room. Alright, here we go! Pay attention! Everybody sit up and act like you got some sense. Everybody sit up straight. This is not a game. I just finished an 18-year-old that I'ma send him to the penitentiary for the rest of his life. He's gonna die in prison. I'm tired of it. Let me ask you guys a question. Do you all think that you all are the worst kids in the entire United States of America? - No. - No. You know what bothers me? Black kids in Missouri get suspended and expelled from school more than any kid in the whole United States of America. That's in all 50 states. This is real. And let me go further. At the elementary school level nine-year-old kids, ten-year-old kids eleven-year-old kids 31% were suspended. They were black kids, man. I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated. I'm trying to keep you out of the system. The reason we have this school is to keep you out of the system not put you in the system. It's not a game. Think I messed up, a lot. As far as that goes I'm not even mad about that. I want you to keep on going to school no matter what. I want you to go with a positive thinking. I can't. I can't do that. - Okay, well... - I'm telling you now. - I can't do it. - You still got to go. You still have to continue your education. Because I don't want you to get comfortable around here in this house and thinking that this neighborhood and the things that are around here is the way of life, and it's not. It's so much bigger and better things out here you wouldn't even believe it. You would not believe you step off this block and might see something different. Mama, what you want to do in the future? - What I like to do? - What'd you like to do? - What do I like to do? - Cook? - So you know what I want to do. - You want to be a cook? - No. - You want to open a restaurant? Yeah. Own my own restaurant. Ooh, soul food? - Everything, all foods. - Everything? You sure can cook. I don't see that happening. Come on. Be quiet though, TJ. Come on, let's go to the store, get some candy. Be quiet. Look at your face when you crying. You better stop that. There's some ugly on there. You better wipe it off. See, like, his mama locked up. His daddy locked up. - That's crazy. - Mm-hmm. And I don't want him to get in some trouble. That's part of the reason why I'm where I'm at now. I was in my senior year and I got put out, expelled. Still looking for a job. So. You're not a old lady. You ain't got no kids. You ain't got no responsibilities none of that. You got so many options out here. So many options. Everybody know Boonie. Everybody know Boonie. What about knowing Boonie when you turn on the TV channel and see Boonie doing something positive. You smart, you could be a journalist or anything. I could be a comedian. - You could be whatever you want to be. - Eddie Murphy. You could be all you could be. Bo knows. What? Oh, you don't know about Bo Jackson. Well, stay on at school. Do what you supposed to do. Everything gonna be alright. Turn to page 349. Alright, we about to get started. Do we all know what the word "origin" means? That means your start point. So if you begin being poor what does the second part of that definition say? They believe firmly that what? Read it out for me. - I don't know if it's right. - What does it say? "Many Americans firmly believe that no matter how humble their origins they can rise in society and go as far as their talents and commitments will take them." What she just read is right. Did you hear what she said, TeTe? Boo-ooh. Oprah was actually born poor, so. Oh, yeah, she was. She was? Okay, I want you to look at this picture up here and let me know what do you see? Looks like a barrel full of water. - They crabs, right? - So they captured. - They finna get ate. - Red Lobster? Why can't they get out? The water's, like, holding them back. Like, they struggling. They struggling to get to the top when they at the bottom. Alright. It's not that many people that actually make it out of the barrel. And then at the same time you always got that one. He got out. He survived. Everybody talking about they want to get out of here. He made it out. Why can't you? ♪ I don't want to wait ♪ For our lives to be over... ♪ We skipping down The sidewalk ♪ I don't want to wait For our lives to be over ♪ You gotta tag her. Tag her! She said, "Uh-uh, if you want to sleep in here, you gotta go, go home." So disrespectful. So disrespectful. Get out of my class. Officer Gray! Officer Gray! I swear to God, that's exactly how she sounds too. I hate that school. I should've never got put out. It feel like ever since I got into high school all bad stuff been happening. It be feeling like that Zharia? It do though, on God. I ain't even gonna fake it. I lost hella people. But for real though. I think Blewett a good school, sometimes. Yeah, we be at school all day so we ain't got to be out on the streets and shit. Nobody got killed yet, nobody locked up. Man, I swear, I think they could've saved Pierre though, on God. - How'd he die? - He got shot in his back this year in May. I got shot too, though. Where you get shot at? In my stomach right here. Right here. What you got shot with, a .22? Uh... 38 You want it like this size? Yup. People be like, "How can you still be acting the way you act?" My head fucked up, man, people just don't know.

Hold that head up and walk the walk of a queen you understand what I'm saying? Trust and believe we gonna make it. October 18, 2013. My friends always like "Y'all gonna end up talking and that." I was like, "No, we not." But we did. His name's Antonio Thomas Shumpert, Jr. He nice, he funny. He a good person to me. You called me Caillou. When I first seen you, I was like... She was like, he hella cute. No, I didn't. Uh-uh. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. It's because a nigga handsome and wealthy. Yes! Good morning, everybody. For you ones that ain't listening if I was you, I would listen. Some of y'all may know we lost a student. Dead, died, shot, killed. That kills my whole spirit and every staff in here, 'cause we feel like we lost. We didn't get a chance to get through to you or something. Trying to understand that somebody care about y'all other than yourself. October 23, 2013. Somebody killed James Deuce yesterday. It's like, crazy as hell. He was 16. Everybody was 16.

Y'all say y'all understand. Y'all get to go to school one more day. Y'all get to fight one more day. Y'all get to do this one more day. - Amen. - Amen. I hope y'all understand. Boonie. Where's your shirt? They say he was coughing up blood and stuff. All them kids, all them friends and stuff that was dyin' before they made it to 18 and we was just all too close. So shit, I thought I was gonna be next. All the time. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's the matter? What's wrong? I be picturing myself in that shit though. Every night. But it don't faze me though, but I be picturing that shit. I be thinking, I'm gonna die. But then, I don't be dead. Then I don't be tripping off of it. But then it happen again. Then over again, then over again then over again. You know? I ain't gonna say it, but you know I might die at a young age, you hear me? 'Cause of the predicament I'm in, you hear me, but... You, I'm gonna make sure you live as long as you can. But I know me. I know for a fact, me, I probably ain't though you hear me? That's just because I know, but... We gonna make it together, you hear? - I love you. - I love you too. And negative 8 times 4 is negative 32. - Okay. - Equals 32. And then you want to get everything on the same side so 5x minus 8x is negative 3x. What did she just do when she did that? - Combine. - Combine like terms, alright. Do you all agree with that? - Yeah. - Alright, go ahead. Ms. Shelton are you doing the work, sweetie? Just because you in an undesirable place, don't mean you gotta act it. Okay? Whatever that answer is, it's the answer. But can you get... can you solve that problem? - Yeah! - Yeah! Now Daje is gonna walk you all through the problem. He a bitch. She's gonna explain what she did. What the fuck? Just be respectful. You be respectful first. You gonna be gone. Now what was I doing? On purposefully trying to make distractions. Let them stay! Will you take Ms. Shelton out? But I didn't do nothing y'all! You come to ICA because you broke rules at your other school. And you're at ICA, still doing the same behavior. Do you want to go to ICA or do you want to be withdrawn? What do I got to be withdrawn for? Inappropriate conversation in class using profanity all kinds of stuff. You're not understanding where you're breaking rules. Before you leave here, you need to understand because if you don't, then it's... there are going to be a different set of consequences for you. So what you want to do? I want to go back to school. Can you stop crying? I'm pissed. Don't tell me what to do. Put your name at the top. It been in my face since I was a little girl. People been labeling me as a bad kid all my life. I was five and I was in kindergarten and I got suspended for something so stupid and little. You don't have to really do nothing. People just expect it. Can I see her for ten minutes? Boonie, tell me why you getting in trouble. He said I was making all type of noise. You gonna do it again? I might. You're not understanding what I'm saying. The pettiness, that's... that's getting dealt to all the students right now. Anything will get you kicked out. Why even flirt with it, with getting in trouble? - You feel like it's fair? - No. Why not? 'Cause I'm the only one that always get consequences and nobody else do. Really? - Yeah. - You the only one? Yep. Okay so, I went out one night with my homeboy, right? Dude at the line said, at the front of the line like, "You can't get in." So he making a scene, right? Police walked up to him took him around the corner. Now, if police took one of your homegirls or homeboys to a back alley, what's first thing to pop in your mind? Definitely beat them. So guess what I did. I started recording. Know what they got me? Another police officer pulled up put me in handcuffs started questioning me. - Guess what I hit him with. - What? I plead the fifth. What I teach you? Fifth amendment. Fifth amendment. And guess what happened. I got locked up. - Guess what they charged me with. - What? Peace disturbance. They tried to do that to me. But look, peace disturbance on the street where there's nothing but bars and loud music. So you in this actual hallway where it's nothing but all loud people and who gets put in ISS? Me. Was it fair? No. Man, oh my God, it's- it's too much, I swear. You know you gonna make it, right? 'Cause I promise you, like, I been there. Alright, now if you... Since that's your what-you-call-it, right? - Mm. - The name of it. So now, before you start writing this you need a heading. Think about it. The Boonie Times. Ooh. - Good Times. - There you go. It was the best of times and it was the worst of times. Boonie Times. Yeah. Ooh, I like that. ♪ We are sisters We stick together. ♪ How are you? Fine, I'm fine, thank you. Who wants to present first? Ms. Boonie? You about to break my ankle. Since you don't want to stand, you can sit. But you gotta be in the middle. Just give me what you got. Okay. It say, "During the years of the Vietnam War the Black Panthers fought for freedom of African-Americans. They were being beaten and killed. They didn't exclude the women either. Initially, the Black Panther Party's core practice was to monitor the behavior of police officers and to challenge police brutality. I agree with this because the government truly and factually has all the power, and the people have none." That's all I wrote about. You did something nobody else did. You actually talked about something that was not in the notes. It was great. ♪ Baby come back ♪ Any kind of fool could see ♪ There was something ♪ In everything about you ♪ Baby come back ♪ I had this on my history test. Who was Elijah McCoy? I don't know. The first black train conductor. Mae Jemison. - Singer? - First black girl astronaut. - First black girl astronaut? - Yep. Okay, I was close! Hello? It's Boonie. - Antonio? - What? When you going back to school? I can't deal with it baby. You wasn't there. Yeah I know you need your education and all but sitting in the school like that? Fuck no, bro, that's some bullshit. That shit got to pissing me off and irking me and I don't like being irked. When I'm irked, I just shake and stop doing anything. Baby... I love you. I love you, bye. What was that about? Some lame-ass shit. You do anything, nigga you fight, you going to jail. You get suspended, you going to jail. You sag, you going to jail. Damn. That's a jail school. Anything you do, you go to jail. That's fucked up. But I'm going down to pick up a trade for construction though. That's what I'm doing. So when I get out I have a construction job and you know, getting that dust. Then buy me my own house. ...by what you say, I'm ready for love. Boy! I'm ready. I'm ready. Oh my God, Antonio. Come on, it's past 8:00 you gonna get me in trouble. Oh my God, you gonna fall with me. You do too much. Move. Move! We want to wish you good luck on all of your tests and hope that you have a happy and safe summer. Yes, ma'am, I was trying to see where Daje was. I've called her cell phone and I can't get any answer. What's the other number? Mom thinks she's running around with the boy versus doing what she's supposed to be doing up here. You have reached the voice-mailbox of... She got to go to school. She can't miss no days. My fucking stomach hurts. You doing alright? No, hell no. - Not hell no? - Fine. Good morning. - Oh good morning Ms. Anne - How are you today? Not good. It's the last day. I know, but... Do you know what you getting ready to get into? No. I'll be ruined. You gonna have a baby? What are you gonna do? I don't know. My family they don't believe in abortion, so I won't. I wouldn't even want to get that. Are you serious? Why are you laughing? It's not a game out here. I'm still struggling. You know. I still cry because there are things that I wish I could have done better or I could have waited till I was older in order to be able to take care of my daughter. But I had to... I had to adjust. Things I missed out. Prom and all those things I couldn't do that. 'Cause I had a baby. Just wish you would've listened to me. I wish I would've listened too. But everybody can't be helped though. I don't even know what to say. I'm gonna try to get a job just for us. For us. Why don't you go home and tell Mama? I feel like the worst kid she ever had. You're my day one, you hear me?

Thank you. I'm hella fat. Yes, I am. Hello. How are you doing? I'm alright. Are you excited? Come on, it's senior year. - Mm-hmm. - So here's your schedule.

'Cause you have to have those math classes to graduate. No if's, and's, or but's, got me? Don't come in with that attitude like "Oh, I got in trouble one time, I can do it again." Not working like that. You'll come back for a whole semester maybe, possibly a year. So don't even do yourself like that. You a grown woman now. You got a baby coming. You ain't even got time for all that. Get it done. We continue following a very hostile breaking news situation. A Ferguson police officer shooting and killing... He wasn't causing harm to nobody. Uh, we had no weapons on us at all. He turned around, he put his hands in the air. He shot him twice, and then he put his hands in the air. ...and he fired seven more shots. Seven more.

Look Taja, it's on every fucking news channel, girl. Reverend Al Sharpton in St. Louis. FBI open civil rights case. Civil rights case. That's a straight civil rights case. That's crazy.

Listen up, I've been telling y'all ever since y'all been here history repeats itself. Y'all seeing it firsthand. Right now, it's in your backyard. You're right in front of the war zone. Tension rose throughout the night. Ferguson police asked for help from 15 law enforcement agencies across St. Louis... No justice, no peace! Hands up! - Hands up! - Hands up! Many of these fires up in this area. The street is blocked off. Instantly, hundreds gathered, angered and saddened by what they called a complete overreaction by the officer. Now a family is demanding answers. You took my son away from me. You know how hard it was for me to get him to stay in school to graduate? You know how many black men graduate? Not many! Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel like they don't got nothing to live for anyway they gonna try to take me out anyway. November 5th, 2014, 6:53 p.m. Dear son... Your eyes was like, super little. Aw, they were so cute. He's gonna cry, okay? You didn't cry when you got your first shots.

So I'ma have somebody come out and explain the program to you. Monday, where you gonna be at? I gotta go to court on Monday. Damn. What's going on with this court stuff, man? They charged me with class A misdemeanor. I can fight or plead guilty. I know they ain't got nothing on me, so, shit. - So why not fight it, then? - Yeah. You gonna plead guilty to something that you didn't do? Boy, if you don't plead guilty they gonna send that shit to trial. Then they really gonna suck your ass. Yeah, shit. They're trying to find something to suck my ass. They're gonna try to suck me if I fight it but they're trying to suck every little dude out here, bro. Should we try to find you something positive to get into? 'Cause like I said, it ain't just you that's dependent on you. Your son depending on you. Boonie depending on you. So you definitely got to start thinking about that. I want you to have an almost perfect childhood. Not perfect, but close to it. I want you to have stuff that I didn't have when I was a kid. I want to look out the window in my house in our house and watch you play on the playground. No, a mockingbird. A rocking bird, whatever. I don't know. He gonna get a rocking bird, you hear me? I want, you at Christmas... I want you to wake up, go run downstairs happy look under the Christmas tree. You got everything you want everything you wished for. I just want you to be happy. Damn.

What's up, Ms. Davis? - Look at her. - Well, happy New Year's. - How's the baby? - Good. ♪ I remember I remember When I lost my mind ♪ Wow. This song is so funny to me. ♪ Y'all make me crazy ♪ Okay, song's over. Alright. Boonie? - Yes. - What did you finish? I ain't all the way caught up, but... Okay, here's my concern. You're not getting enough done. You've got three classes virtually. You've got one class that you're taking by independent study, and you're taking Algebra 2. - Eek. - Yeah, eek is right. Let's work together and get it done. Give me a hug. 'Cause you know you're like my kid. We're gonna get this done, alright? Okay, since y'all don't want to read y'all's first, I'll read mine. My 2014 school year, my life changed. I always told myself, no matter how hard things get I'ma make a way through the thunderstorm until I see the sun shine bright. I came too far to give up now, so I might as well keep fighting and finish school. That was so good, Sam. It ain't never too late to, you know, start over, so... After we graduate, that's when we finna start a whole nother life. You have to start a whole nother life now. - Stuff's gonna get real. - Okay, it's already... It's already getting real. Did you wanna start? 'Cause she's... her story, her story. Just read your story... Okay. The end is almost near for her to graduate but work keeps piling up on her. She had to catch up on a couple classes because when she had her son she went on medical leave and ended up forgetting to do her work. Everyone says she isn't doing the work but she is getting it done for her baby because he needs her. But the day she graduates, jaws are going to drop to the floor because while they discouraged her her mind already was made up on what she was going to do with her life. You can work hard, no matter what you do. It seems like at the last minute you start working hard then everybody doubting you saying that you ain't finna do this and you ain't finna do that, and proving them wrong that day. On that same day that you gonna walk across that stage. She better. Girl, I'm gonna skip across that motherfucker. Run, jump, hop, skip. You look like Big Mama. Uh-huh. Ooh, he's like a Rabbi. Now he look like he from the Soviet Union. You got a long life ahead of you. You doing good right now, you got no worries. This is an ABC News Special Report. Decision in Ferguson. We have breaking news. You see the crowds there waiting to hear whether the grand jury of Ferguson, Missouri will charge Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown. I'm here with Dan Abrams, our Chief Legal Affairs Anchor. And what are the charges that Officer Wilson could face? Anything from involuntary manslaughter or second degree murder. The highest one being first degree murder. You hear all this ruckus going on around you? I don't want him to know about the... that type of life, of murder and crime. If he see that, he's gonna see it on TV. If I can help it. The news, that's what I'm talking about. That's how he gonna find out. After their exhaustive review of the evidence, the grand jury deliberated over two days, making their final decision. They determined that no probable cause exists to file any charge against Officer Wilson, and returned a no true bill on each of the five indictments. That was somebody's son. That was somebody's child. Y'all murdered her fucking son! Everybody think you all cute and adorable now. But when you grow up, it's like they all look at you different. I want you to do what you got to do... And never look back on St. Louis. - Hello? - I have a prepaid call from... "Man Man." An inmate in City of St. Louis Medium Security Institution. - Hello? - Hello? What happened? Look I didn't know it was no stolen car. You hear me, I didn't know it was no stolen car.

So, he's going to have to sit in jail until the end? Unless you can make bond, yes. - And his bond $500? - Yes, ma'am. Alright, thank you. Alright. - That's bullshit. - Who gonna get him out?
