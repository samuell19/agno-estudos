Cleo, hi. I think your father isn't doing so well today. He hasn't eaten since yesterday, and I don't really know what to do anymore. Okay, I'm in the middle of a tutoring session right now. Do you think you can come over after? Yes. Sure. Great, thanks. Julio, hi, I'm sorry I can't make it today. I have to go to school again after my tutoring session. How's he doing? He's sleeping now. He ate some fruit. I think you should come over and see him tomorrow. Good, at least he ate something, right? Listen, could you do me a favor? I have to call a new student, and I was wondering if you could stay longer with him on the weekend. Think you could do that? I'll think about it, okay? Oh, thanks, Julio. I don't care about the nickel. I want to do something for Mr. Cartwright. Before they kill him. From outside you mean? That's the way it's gotta be. They were kings and stuff. Julio? Yeah, Cleo. Hi. Hi, how are you? Good, good. Listen, I'm sorry I couldn't make it this afternoon. I was really busy all day. You know, new session students. I understand. Anyway, I left your check in the mailbox. Oh, thank you. No problem, I just got a lift from a friend and we happened to be passing by your neighborhood. No big deal. Did you think about what we talked about? Yeah, I think I might be able to do it. Oh my God, great, thank you, Julio. You're welcome. Is this Intermediate French II? Yes. Hi, I'm new here. I'm confused. Well, the class doesn't start for another 15 minutes. - Oh, seriously? - Mm hmm. Can I just wait here til then? Sure. If you want to. Thanks. That was an awesome class today. Thanks. I'm glad to hear that Rimbaud didn't scare you away. No, not quite. Listen, we're having a welcoming party next week for the new students, so I hope you can join us. For sure. Great, so I'll see you next class. Sounds good. You want one? Oh, no thanks, I quit. You know, I heard you can't really quit being a smoker. Like you can go without a cigarette for 10 years, but put one in your mouth, you'll be right back at it. I believe it's true. Actually, sorry if this is rude, but if you're trying to quit, why are you hanging around the smoking section? Because sometimes it's easier to be close to something you really desire, even if you know can't have it, than try to avoid it entirely. That's an interesting idea. I don't know, I don't think I could be around something I want without trying to take it. Well, I feel that longing is what really makes somebody feels alive. Anyway, different people have different way of navigating through life, and I guess that's what makes us so fascinating as a species. Right? Sure. Break is over. Can I ask you something? Sure. I'm interested in taking some private French classes, try to speed up my progress. Well, you know you can talk to Sabine at the front desk, and she'll look into opens for you. Totally, I just, I like the way you teach. Is there anyway I could take one-on-one classes from you? No, my schedule's really full. I don't want to take any more students, but, hey, listen, we have a lot of really good teachers here, and I'm sure we can find someone that can meet your needs. Tell you what, why don't you think about it, and if you change your mind, here's my number. Okay. Julio? Cleo. Hey, hi, I'm sorry I couldn't make it this week. You know, it just got really busy. How's he doing? Well, he's been asking for you a lot, but, other than that, I think he's doing okay. He's doing better. Okay, has he been eating at all? Yeah, he managed to eat quite a bit today. Well that's good. I'll try to come over next week. All right, see you then. Take care. Thanks, bye. Bye bye. Try one, one, just one. Okay. It's good, huh? Hey. Hey. What's up? Fine. Cool, did you think at all about what I asked you? Uh, what? Sorry. The tutoring. I talked to the front desk, but I'd really like to have classes with you. I like the way you teach. I think we can do it on the weekend. Is that good? So we could start tomorrow? I have errands tomorrow. How about the evening? Perfect. Cool. Cool. All right. - It's a good party, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's good. - Fine. This is a good party? I think, it's nice. Well, I don't really care, but as a teacher I think it's a great occasion for you guys to get to know each other and practice French. Is anybody speaking French? I need to go to the bathroom. See you. There you are. Hey. You always leave without saying goodbye? Ever since I was young. That's what we call a. What are you doing here then? Waiting for my ride. I'll give you a ride. No, no, it's okay, they're on their way. How long? 10 minutes. It's Friday. You sure? Yes, I am sure. Well I'm gonna go then. Okay, go. All right, well, bye. Ditto. Have a good night. You really gone make me leave you waiting here all alone? You're a very persistent boy, you know that? I'll take it. I like this song. It's this indie French band. That's interesting. What kind of music do you like? Oh, I like all sort of things. I like Pink Floyd, Mozart, Leonard Cohen. I like all kinds of stuff, probably because growing up, my parents played everything from classical music to Queen. Good for you. So many kids your age like Justin Beaver. Oh my gosh,. Uh, Bieber. Uh huh. How old do you think I am? Too young. Why'd you move here? Well, you know, the usual, fell in love, got married. He died seven years ago. Oh, I'm sorry. There you go. Thank you so much for the ride. Of course. So you'll let me know tomorrow if we can start lessons? - Yes, I will. - Sounds good. - Good night. - Good night. Sleep tight. I surely will. I'm going to get something to drink. Can I get you anything? Water's good. Thanks. It's my best friend's birthday tonight. You going? Yeah, but... Great. Lesson's not over yet. Oh, no, no, no, it's already, we're done for the day. I didn't realize I'd been here that long. Well, it's already ten o'clock. You should come. Where? To the party. No, no, no, I don't think so. It's gonna be fun. I'm sure, but it's okay. You don't like having fun? Yes, I like having fun. Oh, really? Mm hmm. So you'll come to the party? Take me home. I'm too old for that shit. What? You're not old, relax, it's gonna be fun. No, no, no, goodnight. Come on, well, hold on, close the door. What? Just close the door. Better be good. Can you tell me, how do you say this in French? No, no, you go ahead, I smoked way too much of it in high school. You go ahead, you have fun. You sure? Mm hmm, I'm sure. One hit. Ooh! What? What, nothing! Okay. Okay, fine, fine, I lied to you, okay? I never smoke weed before. Ah, did your lose your light weed ribbon? - Yes I did. - Ah, classic. Here. - I'm such a klutz. - Am I, like, is this like a bad influence moment because I'm pretty into it. - Even CPR. - At least we have a good attitude about it. Take it easy. Take it easy. Or, of course, don't take it easy. That was the other option, hit it. Teach me some more bad words in French. Really? Yeah, my understanding is that swearing is an integral part of being a functioning member of French society, so, you know, it's imperative that I know how to say fuck you. You got it. - Is that it? - Yeah, yeah! Aw, sick! I'm gonna hit somebody with that today, tonight, look out party. Oh my God, that's pretty good. You know, it reminds me, I used to teach French in juvie, you know, bad ass kids. So they would behave during the classroom, if they were really good, the last five minutes, I would be teaching them cuss word in French. Wow. If I had just done like a little graffiti when I was 14, I could've been in your class? Oh my God, so we had a math teacher, and she was a real cunt, you know, yeah, she used to wear tight, like, her pants. So when she would walk in my classroom, interrupting everybody, and she look at one of my students, and she said, Eddie, how do you say love math in French? He said. Oh, oh,. Oh, it sounds so romantic! Oh my God, oh my God, the kids went ape shit! That was quite a story. I love, I love to teach. I can see why. I never knew you had it in you. You seem so straight in class. Yeah, I fooled you. Yep. What else you want to know? How do you say motherfucker? Pucker your lips like you're about to kiss. You know, here, I should show you, there's this other way to smoke, here, check it out. What? That's it. Party's over. All right, come on, we'll just go inside the party, come on. Oh no, no, no. I can't, I can. Look, my eyes all red and shit. What, what? You're a beautiful woman. You want a beer? I don't like beer. Don't they have any wine here? Uh, there's coconut water. Oh, come on, no wine? You Americans are so tacky. How could you have a party and no wine? I'm not going to take that personally. I'm thinking about that coconut water, though. Wanna go outside? I know you said you quit, but maybe the temptation is just too strong? Is that a dare? You tell me. Don't tempt me. - No? - No. All right. - Bad idea. - Hey, Matt. Helen, hey. - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. How you been? I'm good, it's been a while. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, how are things? They're great. - Yeah? - They're great, fantastic. Yeah, I'm leaving next month. I'm going to Paris. I saw that on Facebook, that's great. Yeah, it's finally happening. We're gonna miss you. Well, I'm sure that's an exaggeration. Not really, not really. All right, very cool. Hey, can I get a cigarette? Uh, I think I need to go to the restroom. Do you want me to come with you? No, no, don't worry, I won't get lost. Okay, well it's down the hall to the left. Uh huh. - Thank you. - Of course. So things are good? Oh my God, I could not believe. Who was that old hag? I think she's his mother. No, I can't believe he would take his mother to the party. Good morning, mademoiselle. May I? You're already here, aren't you? Okay? What? Are you okay? Yeah. Do you know you're very beautiful? Oh God, please. The most beautiful woman in the world. Stop it. It's an ancient cleaning technique. I need absolute concentration. You kiss me like a chicken. All right, now you do me. Your chest is more hairy than mine. Yeah, probably a little, probably a little. But, exactly, that's what I'm saying. You should let that little baby grow out. Soothe the cable. What, the hair? - Could be funny. - Well, well, I don't shave. What,. Okay, I see where you're going with that. Oops, I dropped the soap. Should I pick it up? No, leave it. And furthermore, I promises two cans of spinach for every part. Here's me past record, folks, which speaks for itself. You double-crosser, steal my voters, will you? Crazy. I seem to remember lots of things that you're trying to forget. I don't want to smoke anymore. Good. It's bad for you. Oh, it doesn't mean I want to quit. Ladies, before we begin, I'd like to say I am extremely sorry for your loss. Leon was a remarkable man. Let's get started, shall we? So he entitled you to the house and the house in Big Bear, as well as monetary investments and titles. Hold on, you said Big Bear? Yes, a house. Well, more like a cabin. You guys weren't aware? No, I had no idea, he never said anything about that. Your dad loved surprises. Well, are you sure he never mentioned it to you? May I continue? Yes. So I just need you to sign the highlighted areas of the following pages. These are all the numbers of his accounts, and the key to the cabin. That's it, just here? Yes, thank you. You're welcome. That'll be it. Thanks. So, when are we going to go to Big Bear, check out that cabin? I'm not sure, maybe next week. I have to take some time off of work first. I'm going to New York next week. Oh, my God. This is so ugly. It so ugly that it's cool. I love it. Oh my God. Look at, look at all this. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, for the matching tie. Oh my God. Oh, God, no. Oh my God. He's totally fucking you. So good to see you laugh. I found some old boxes in the garage. Thank you. I don't know what we'd do without you, Julio. Julio, did you know that Mom has a boyfriend? Really? Is that why you have been so hard to get ahold of? I'm going to the car to get something. No way. Do you know who it is? No idea. I'll find out. Tell me. Oh, I will. I'll be taking this downstairs. I'll be back, okay? Okay. Thank you, Julio. You're welcome. God, she was so pretty. Yeah. I think at the ending, they finally learned to love each other. He was not the best husband, you know. Cheated on her. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I can't have a boyfriend without cheating. We're not perfect, Sophie. I made a lot of mistakes, but I tried. I know, I know. Mom. Are you ever going to drive again? No. Mom, the accident was so long ago. You know, you're not the only one that lost him, and why don't you keep any pictures of him around the house? My house, my rules. How could I forget? Oh la la, how old are you? You're acting like a teenager. Talking to your boyfriend? No. Okay. Oh my God, I love this song. Hi, uh, Sabine? No, I'm Lisa. Sabine is on her break. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm Cleo's daughter. She asked me to give these to Marie. Do you know where Sabine is? Uh, no, actually I don't. Okay. You new here? No, I speak French fluently. So you're a teacher? No. Marie is in a meeting right now, but, if you want, I can take it for her. Oh, thank you. You're so kind. You're welcome. So you're fluent? Yeah, yeah, it's my first language. Where are you from? I'm from here, but I should go. It's nice to meet you guys. Sorry, do you know where Sabine is? She's on her break. Oh my God! Can you stop complaining? Just relax, be happy. I am relaxed! Okay, well be happy! You know, it's always my fault, it's never your fault, right? You just need to get laid. What? I knew it, I knew it! With that guy Matthew, you're fucking him. Oh come on, don't be so vulgar. Okay, well, tell me about him. Oh, oh, is he an old fox like George Clooney? No, beside, George Clooney only likes young girls. Oh, lucky me. He's hot. He's married, forget about him. I know. To what, a lawyer or something? Mm hmm. You know, they kind of look alike. You're right, I know, I read something about that the other day online, and according to the the issue's psychologist, we're much more inclined to fall in love with someone who looks related to us. - Ew. - Yeah, gross, right? Which is explaining why incest is a taboo all over the world. You know, nobody wants to give birth to an inbred, right? Ew! God! Ew, Mom. What? Does Matthew look like your brother? Oh, come on! Okay, okay, time out. When's your flight on Thursday? Thank you. Thank you. Now what are you going to do with all of his things? I think I'm just gonna give it away to charity. He'd love that. - Yeah. - That's good. Thank you so much for being there for him. It meant a lot to me. Me, too. I want you to have something from him. It's his medical bracelet. Oh. No, I have the rental car. Yeah, I forgot. Sophie. So, I'm not going to do anything I don't like to do. Okay. Okay,. Okay, okay, see you soon. Right. Surprise! Mom, it's fine, he said I could take it next week. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I just didn't expect you to be here, that's all. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Okay. Look, I know that you like your space, but I just didn't want you to drive to Big Bear alone. Oh, Mom, Mom. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Wait, wait, you know each other? How do you know each other? Mom, what's going on? Mom? This is your daughter? Yes, yes. Matthew, it's to a good time for you to be here. Okay. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. Matthew? Like the Matthew, your boyfriend? Oh, Mama, what the hell? That's disgusting, Mom. He was flirting with me the other day. You were flirting with her? No, I was not, I was not flirting with you. I was being polite. Oh, oh my god, I think I know the difference between flirting and being polite, okay? Okay, you cut it out, you two. I'm going to Big Bear on my own. See you. I was just being polite. I'm gonna come in. Ooh hoo, so this is grandpa's man cave. Man cave? It doesn't have a party room. Look at all the tchotchkes. I would have liked to collect all that crap. No, I'm just saying, you seemed pretty excited to send me off to New York, so. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. You know, Matthew, it was so nice of you to drive us. - For sure. - We really, really appreciate it, and I think there's going to be a pretty bad storm later today. The roads are gonna get kind of gross, so. Yeah, I heard, actually. I was looking on my phone. It looks like it's gonna hit pretty soon. Do you think, sorry, would it be all right if I stayed the night? Sure, sure you can. I mean, yeah, but the roads are fine now. It's still pretty sunny, so. Or you could just drive nearby and get a hotel. Matthew, you're welcome. Is she okay, or? I'm sorry, she's a little feisty. I think she get it from her mother. For sure. Maybe it's better if you sleep on the couch tonight. No. Matthew, come on, no sad eyes. - I love you. - Oh, come on now. You just want to fuck the French teacher. No. I love you. Stop saying that. Okay. Sorry for all the trouble. Don't. It's my fault anyway. I think I left something in my car. I should go get it. Okay. Yeah. So, Matt, what do you do? I'm a musician. I play the piano and cello. Oh, that's interesting. I'm a filmmaker. Oh, cool, I love films. I would love to do some scoring some day. Oh my God, we should work together. I mean, you know, since we're kind of all becoming a little family here. Where are you going? To the kitchen. Why? Why? Will you get some more wine? - No. - Why? - I'm not getting more. - Why? You're very drunk. Oh, I think that I'm old enough, and our little friend Matt here is old enough to make, you know, our own decisions, right? Right, Matt? Okay. Guess I'll just get it myself. What? Oh, you don't want me to be French with your little baby boyfriend? Oh, that's right, I forgot. You only like to spend time with people who aren't related to you. No. You want some more wine? Um, okay, sure. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. So, you were saying you're a musician. Yes. So why are you taking French classes? 'Cause in a month I'm going to Paris to study there. Oh my God, me, too. Not, me too, I mean, I want to. I want to, for film school. I just love French films. I mean, European films, actually. Yeah, me, too, I love European films. Really? Wow, it's so rare to come across an American who, you know, has an appreciation for European films. I mean, most Americans don't even watch foreign films, right? That's true, yeah. I was talking to somebody the other day who works in film, and he had never even heard of Varda or Kubrick. Oh my God, okay, no, no! That guy was a douche, he doesn't work in film, he plays with his little film toys. He was an American, naturally. Of course, of course, he was. So what's your favorite French film? I really like The 400 Blows. That is crazy. Me, too. - Oh. - Me, too, it's my favorite. It's my favorite. Okay, so, this is kind of a cliche question, but I think that you can tell a lot about a person by their answer, so Godard or Truffaut? Truffaut. Shut up, me, too, me, too! I mean, Godard, he has my heart 'cause he's amazing, but Truffaut, I mean. I mean, I like Godard, too, but I think I prefer Truffaut. Yeah. Cleo, do you prefer Truffaut? I like them both. So you were saying that you wanted to work in scoring for film? You know, that movie No Country for Old Men, it has no music in it. Really? Mm hmm, it's true. No, I didn't know that. Yeah, that's because it's so well done. You just didn't notice, but next time you watch it, pay attention. Hello, where are you going with those desserts? To the kitchen. If you want some more, come and get it. Uh, okay, thank you. I need a cigarette, do you smoke? Uh, yeah, but... Oh, she doesn't like it when we smoke inside so we gotta go outside. Come on, let's go. Okay. No, I actually did almost throw up in that class. Yeah, for sure. Oh my God, I've never been back. It's ridiculous. - I know. - I went to one once like to support my friend 'cause, like, he knew the instructor and it was like, Matt, go to this class for like a social reason. And I went, and I looked at him halfway through, and I was like, you owe me. It sucked. It's horrible. - It's horrible. - Horrible. Stop screaming at me. What are you guys up to? Oh, just didn't want to get the cigarette smoke inside. It's kind of cool outside. Yeah, I'm just about done here. Let's go inside. Uh, I'll come in when I'm done. You want some more of that? Sure, sure, but it's not what I want right now. What, what do you want? You. - Yeah? - Yeah. I don't think it's a good idea, you know. She's outside. Okay, I want some more wine. What you need is a glass of water. I'm fine, I don't need water. You know, one thing I really have to give this family credit for is our taste in music. Wow. - Right? - Yeah. That's an impressive collection. I know, I know. Oh, fuck. Okay, it's not working. But that's okay, you can just play something on your phone, right? Sure. Here. Oh, I love this song. That's enough. What is your problem? Can you put the music back on, please? This is not a party here. Well I wanna dance! Oh, finally. I look like you when you cheated on my father. You fucking coward! I'm sorry you had to see that. It's okay, I don't always get along with my mom, either. Sophie, are you okay? Leave me alone! Damn it, I told you not to drink like a pig. Fuck off! Like a fish you mean? What? Drink like a fish. Oh, okay. Well, big fish, horses, you still have to sleep on the couch tonight. Bummer. Oh, my head is killing me. Do you have any soda? Okay, Mom, I don't want to listen to your little speeches. Do you have any aspirin. There's no medication in this house? Why are you so fucking annoying? Now I see why Dad did what he did. Even before you cheated on him, he couldn't stand you. You have no idea what you're talking about. He told me you cheated on him. Sophie, I don't want to talk about it. Look out, Matt, my mom cheats on her men. Sorry. Do you want to talk about what happened this morning? I'm a little confused. Sure. It's kind of complicated. Sounds like. Is there anyway it might help to talk about it? Sophie and I argued about her father last night. I'm not the best person. It's not a competition. My mother used to tell me to marry someone who loves me more than I love him. That was Sophie's father. After she was born, things changed, and I became invisible. And I just wanted to be desired again. So I went out and met with this friend. I know I should've just got the hell out and run with my life, but I couldn't. Stuck around. One night, I didn't come home. Then when I went home the next morning, he was drunk, waiting for me, and he dragged me by the arm down the driveway, yelling that Sophie was too young to see a whore in real life. He shoved me into the car. The last thing I remember was his dead eyes looking at me. And he jumped the median and drove us across oncoming traffic. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. No need to apologize. Just an old wound now, but I keep on picking at the scabs. Come here. Think we should go look for her? Even though she's doing that to me? What if something happened to her?
