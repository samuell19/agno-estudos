MAN: Order. Order. MAN: Sir Robert will see you now. Please come in. [whispering] Mrs. Paige, we're delighted to see you. Sir Robert. We've heard about the good work you've been doing in Europe. We need help with the French, to go to Paris to haggle over farm prices. I thought Sir Michael was in charge. No, Sir Michael his broken his neck, out riding. I hope he's all right. Oh he's fine, but not up to haggling, particularly with the French, which involves a great deal of shaking your head. Good. Thank you. And thank you for coming. CLARA PAIGE: Not at all. You'll be briefed. Ah. I thought you were in Strasbourg. No. Isn't it Thursday? Yes, but it's not the right week. No. I hate you. You don't believe it. Every time I say it, you think it's because of something you've done-- the latest incident, whatever it is. You think that when the incident is over, ah well, the hatred will be over. But it won't. It's you that I hate, what you are, what your represent-- drink and cowardice is equal parts. The whole dreary mixture disgusts me. You better get going. You're late for the house. [car horns] [non-english speech] [applause] It's an honor for me to present these community awards to these fine men who've done so much to help so many newcomers to fit into the host community. [applause] - Thank you. - Congratulations. Well done. [applause] MAN: But you see, Mrs. Paige, we know you are sincere. Yes. Although your politics are not ours, we know you work very hard as our European MP. But we're not sure what the common market does for people like us. Yes. Yes, I can see. Be careful, your baby is falling. Yes, you may think, what has this parliament, miles away in Strasbourg, got to do with me? How does it actually affect my daily life? I found working in Europe, I've begun to care passionately. The Parliament actually embodies an ideal-- peace and prosperity in Europe. And this is something in which I think we all believe. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Very nice to meet you. We've pleased to have you get started representing us. Let me find you a cab. Excuse me, I wonder, do you think I could go out the back way? [phone ringing] Yes? MAN: I know what you're doing. I know who you are. Where's your husband? He isn't with you. Why don't you ask me to come around? God, you scared me. No idea what you mean. Morning. Goodness, I'm sorry. - Calm down. - I am sorry. - Calm down. - I tried to get here earlier. - He's fine. It's madness. It's all right. I can't tell you what it was like. He's been having a wonderful time. MAN: My Darling, how are you? I was going to come yesterday but I just got so busy. Hey, mum. He's been fine. Did Did you miss me? Hmm? I'm sorry, but the worst is over, I promise you that. Look. They're from Fortnum's, the gooey ones you like. What's this? Did you make it? Well, mostly. - Would you like a cup of tea? - Please. I'll show you. It's just been hectic with all this enabling legislation. It has to be taken through point by point. Will you show me? It was dumped at my lap and said, look, use the summer recess to go through it. - Well, it's nice to be needed. - Yes. It isn't all bad. And what about you? You've had a new haircut. It does look attractive. Clara, I'm your sister. It's a perfectly ordinary haircut, neither good nor bad. I don't need flattery. You have my vote. The minister at four to discuss new European legislation. There's a drinks party for the road transport lobby at six. Hmm hmm. Can you see the diary? Also-- Yes? A man's been calling the office. He says he's a friend of yours. Though his name's-- If it's who I think it is, the answer is no. So did you have a nice time at Pauline's? No. I know you did. You always do. You always say you prefer it to home. I don't. You do, in a way, my little boy. Do you want these? CLARA PAIGE: Ah, yes. And Sandra, the stuff about education? SANDRA: Yes, it's here. CLARA PAIGE: Just leave it there. I'll go through it later. How was school? Horrible. [door bell] Simon, you do make me laugh. Hold on. Sorry, I'll get it. Come in. Hi ya, kids. I like your haircut. I heard you got-- Sorry, old boy. I've got to spend the weekend in my constituency, listening to a lot of people moan. CLARA PAIGE: If I could, I'd bring up Simon in the country. Simon's in here. He's been looking forward-- GIRL: I've found him! I've found him! WOMAN: Hello, Simon. Here are all of your friends. GIRL: Will you play with me? I'm sorry. No. About yesterday. I went too far. Mr. Paige. Yes, I'm coming. If we just had some time. Your car's here. No good. You lucky boy. I'm going to miss you. But now we're here. Give your mother a kiss. Good afternoon, gentleman. Afternoon. CLARA PAIGE: Hello. How nice. How are you? Jack. You're a bit late. CLARA PAIGE: I know. I had to give out some community awards. My god, you do take it seriously, meeting the people. CLARA PAIGE: I like it. I do lots of it. Isn't it meant to be part of the job? Yes, it is. CLARA PAIGE: Is this the right way? JACK: Through here. Through here. [inaudible] of you. CLARA PAIGE: Adam. They tell me you're today's star. Me, the star? No, aren't you? Don't we see you everywhere? Me, not really. Hello, my dear. How are you? This came for you. Thank you. Television, radio-- it seems to be you on every channel. Adam's exaggerating. The man was wearing a very strange suit. Still I suppose if there has to be a new wave it's best it looks like you. What? Oh yes. The classic text of 17th century conservatism. We'd better sit down. Hello, Clara. Michael. It's nice to see you. You're getting very big. Nobody's big in England. So you better tell me, what do you want? I've heard the Jack Haperson Society was having a weekend. And what is it, by the way? Conservative philosophy group. High-powered, plainly. Just old friends, that's all, taking time off, Michael, between busy schedules to discuss philosophical issues. Yes. To be frank, the only reason I'm here is because I read about your group in the paper. I wanted to talk to you. Talk to me? Business. Now look, Michael, please. Look, just hear me out. It's nothing like last time. Michael, I have this fear of prison. Is that unreasonable for a member of the European Parliament? Look, there's no question of that. I have a scheme, in the field of microchip technology. I could explain. I think it would go over your head. In some ways it goes over mine. But, the result would be an all-British wristwatch which is also a television as well. Michael, do you realize how much capital investment is needed for microchip work. Not for research. For research, you just need a bloke, which I have-- a friend of mine who is a genius. You'd like him, honestly. In Wales you can pick up these government grants. From Gerald and you I'd want less than a quarter, 80,000 at most. In return you wouldn't hear from me, until I repaid you, of course. Is there a prospectus? What? A prospectus-- have you written out a specification for the project? Really? Would you-- do you really need that, given what you know of me? Or to put it more directly-- Yes? What What I know of you. Say I know who you are. What? CLARA PAIGE: Just say it. Have you rung my flat? I wouldn't dream of ringing you. What-- you mean without saying who I was? Yes, all right. I'm sorry. It was a mistake. Clara! My money. Give me a few days. I need time to think. MAN: I told him to go into [inaudible].. [laughter] MAN: Yeah, so I heard-- Toby mentioned it. I saw him a couple of weeks ago. MAN: Tell me, are you thinking of giving your house over to-- MAN: No, no. So, I'm only sorry your wife couldn't make it. MAN: Weren't you two at school? We were. Have you heard? She's having another baby. CLARA PAIGE: Goodness, don't you-- Six, but now we're going to have seven. I believe in practicing what I preach. After all, my book on the family-- I was hoping to get time to read it. The basic conservative unit, am I right? CLARA PAIGE: Well certainly you seem to think so. When's the baby due? Any time now. In fact, very probably tonight. Look here. This way, I can go for a walk. When it beeps, I know the baby's coming. Of course it could be the PM. One or the other. I see. And where is she beeping from? What? Angela, I leave her at home. Oh yes, I do think people finally know. I mean, people know what to do with their gut instinct tells them. If you listen to that, in my view, you won't go far wrong. I mean, I can remember when I was a socialist. [laughter] All right. Quite a lot of historians were. Then there was always this agony. Should I do this? Oh I wonder, is this right? Is this wrong? And then when I saw the light I do remember this weight being lifted-- no more having to think. Not wasting one's life and uncertainty and guilt. Do what you want to, surely. MAN: Yeah. Yeah. That's the basis of freedom. At this table surely that's what everyone wants. MICHAEL: Hello? I've decided no, that's the end of it. MICHAEL: Clara. Absolutely not. I won't pay. What happened this evening was blackmail. Please let me finish. Because you think you can bring up my past and ruin my career, but I promise you, you have no such power. Michael, I'm calling your bluff. MICHAEL: Listen. [phone ringing] MAN: Your don't fancy a night cap? Who's that? MAN: It's a well-known philosophy story. I'm already in bed. MAN: Fine. Good night. Good night. Let us look now at the philosophy of the national health size. It's reminding me of a story about a woman in Russia. She went to office and said, I want a car. So they said-- How day you come here. Just look around you. Do you have no idea who these people are? I'm trying to keep everything together. I'm working 14 hours a day. I've got a family as well. I just need money. Clara, you're my last chance. I-- I'm begging you. Excuse me. Please. This must be done quietly. Who is he? I have no idea. Clara! Clara! It's absolutely ghastly. It really is. We so feel so awful it's happened. We wish you wouldn't leave. Honestly, it's fine. Please stay. Are you sure you didn't know him? He seemed to know you. I'm due in Paris. I'm going to be late. [speaking french] CLARA PAIGE: Merci [phone ringing] Gerald? Gerald? It's Clara. GERALD PAIGE: Hello. You're back. Have I woken you? Look, I've had to go sooner than I thought. I went straight to the airport. GERALD PAIGE: Why? I'll tell you why later. I just had to get out. The thing is-- it's just that I promised Simon I'd call by Pauline's tonight and read him a story. If you could go. GERALD PAIGE: It's always me. What if you can, with you? I'd really be grateful. GERALD PAIGE: I'll do it. That's really sweet of you. Thanks. [bell ringing] Hello. Is it, Clara Paige, isn't it? That's right, yes. Oh, I smile at everyone. It's a habit. It's safest for a politician. You have no reason to-- remember, but I'm Wallace Sharp. Yes of course. You helped us with the sighting of a factory in France. - How is it? They're about to sell 2,000 of my bedside lights to a chain of French motels. Is that what you do? I can't remember. Yes. I design. Well that's excellent, that you sold so many. In a way. I'm bored already, thinking of the next thing. I never stick at anything for long. [speaking french] Would you like a drink? I'm afraid not. You want a drink. Goodness me. No. [inaudible], yes I would. You seem rather light-headed. I was glad to get out of England, that's all. Are you often in Paris? Sadly, no. The parliament moves between Luxembourg and Strasbourg-- both very boring towns. But I was brought up in Birmingham, so it's fine. - Is your husband with you? - Gerald? No. Gerald's at Westminster. He's too busy. It's a shame. What about you? Oh I don't really live anywhere, if that's what you mean. It's all a question of where I can work. But my sister's married to a Frenchman, so when I'm in Paris I stand in their flat. I love being abroad. I feel safe. It's like airplanes, from the moment you get on to the moment you leave. No one can get at you. I have. Yes, but you don't want anything, so you don't count. Ah, there you are. We heard you'd arrived early. Rather a surprise but we managed to catch up you. Hello. If you have any time, I know Paris very well. Yes. Call me. MAN: If we'd known, we would have sent you a card. I have all the relevant briefing documents. We're waiting to see which way the Germans will jump. CLARA PAIGE: Oh yes? MAN: The Germans, of course, are notoriously difficult. At least they have been in the past. As for the Belgians, well I never met a Belgian who didn't understand-- I'm sorry. There's something I forgot to say to my friend. [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] Hello. You see, she's the best Yiddish French cook in Paris. [speaking french] [speaking french] That's her speciality. [speaking french] He is insolent. Very. My sister's not bad as well. How long are you staying this time? [speaking french] He never stays long. [speaking french] [speaking french] Do you have children? I have a son. [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] Are you getting this? CLARA PAIGE: Pretty well. Being Jewish means being aware of history. Paul feels a Jew is always going to be a stranger, in a country. [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] We belong. WALLACE SHARP: There are parts of the [inaudible] which never seemed to change, in spite of everything. The rest of Paris is ruined. Well it is, isn't it? It's all overpriced art galleries and banks. This is one of the few decent bits left. And even this is going very fast. So you were always going to be in politics. No. I was in business. My mother died. She left me a couple of houses-- property which I rented out. Then Gerald came along with a partner of his and suggested we start a mail order business. That was fine for a while. Business crashed? There was tight patch during the late '70s. We'd over-expanded. We had to hive off the loss-making parts. The dress side got some bad publicity-- people who sent checks for goods they never received. By then it was no longer ours, legally. Who owned it? The partner. He was called Swanton. Swanton? Micheal Swanton. A rather sad man. I don't look like that. WALLACE SHARP: Yes you do, to me. Don't you see it? Yes, I do now. How I envy you this, this easiness. WALLACE SHARP: Yes. It's fresh air. 165 Jewish children from this school deported to Germany during the Second World War were exterminated in Nazi camps. Never forget. I have a fantasy now. I shall walk around Paris all night, and when dawn comes I shall be sitting under the Eiffel Tower to watch it. Then I shall have to go back to work. Thank you for the most wonderful night. Do you want me to walk with you? No. Not tonight. [sudden noise] Clara. What are you doing? - Nothing. - What do you mean? Hey, I'm doing nothing. You are following me. [sudden ringing] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] Can I help you, Madam? No. No, not really. WOMAN: [speaking french] WALLACE SHARP: [speaking french] Sorry, are you all right? CLARA PAIGE: Yes, it's silly. I was panicking. I needed to talk. I've lost my handbag. It isn't-- you haven't seen it? You haven't got it? No. We can look. I think-- well I-- I had it when I left here. You had it in the cafe, remember? You offered to pay. That's right. That's right, yes I did. I've forgotten that. Yes. And then I think-- well I did what I said I was going to do. Do you remember? When I left you I said I wanted to spend the night sitting under the Eiffel Tower. Did you? Well yes. Yes I did. And did you have your bag? No. Well yes. Or perhaps I did. No, not at the end. That's when I realized, I'd been sitting for-- well what time is it? WALLACE SHARP: It's 4:30. I suppose for a couple of hours. Would that be right? Just dreaming. There's a little garden where the lights are that shine on the tower. It's such a lovely garden and really I was feeling so relaxed, so free. And then I went for a stroll around the base of the tower, looking up. I thought, oh, I've left the bag on the seat. But it wasn't there. CLARA PAIGE: No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come really. I came because I thought it might be here. Also, to be honest-- Yes? There was something else. GERALD PAIGE: [speaking french] [speaking french] Oh, I'm sorry. Stephanie, there you are. [speaking french] [speaking french] Oh, you came back. [speaking french] WOMAN: Oh how terrible. Well Wallace will help. Other people's lives always seem so attractive. We all feel that-- anyone's life but our own. WOMAN: Yeah, come on. Piss off. Go away to bed. WALLACE SHARP: You were going to say, just before they came in, something else? Oh yes. No. Only, well I've lost everything. Isn't it absurd? Bankbook, credit cards, driver's checks. Is that coffee coming? Yes, the whole lot. They had a look. There are no bags. Oh well. There we are. Shall we report it? Report it? Yes. Do you mean to the police? Well, surely yes. I don't see how else you're going to get it back. Did you get all that? - Mostly. They're saying it's too early. You can't expect anything. It's probably be stolen, and you'll never see it again. - Oh, yeah. - [speaking french] - [speaking french] Oui. [speaking french] He says-- Yes, I know. It's a long way. I didn't notice. [speaking french] [speaking french] I did cross the river. I must have. I think by Notre Dame. But then I never went near the river again. Ah, Mrs. Paige, how wonderful. We've found you. Good morning. How distressing this thing must be. Quite an awful introduction to Paris. I promise you, untypical. Lawrence. Mr. Sharp has been looking after me. Foreign office. Good morning. Do you mind if I take Mrs. Paige? You've been wonderful. Are you off? Mrs. Paige has to go now. Thank you. I trust I'll see you again. This is great. See, it's a government credit card. We have a wonderful deal they just put your name on. We have what you call a special relationship. It used to be with America, now it's with American Express. [car horns] You can settle up when you get back to England. I got rather nervous of losing things. Shall I hold onto it for the moment? Oh, and we got you a float. I can manage that I think. I'm president of the Embassy Amateur Dramatic Society. We've rather a hit on our hands. I just gave you last night's take. How convenient. Yes, well, we're doing [inaudible].. The French just love it. I don't know it. I have the best part. There's very little chance of this conference actually coming to anything. They've had 30 of these things. They never work. The French government is in permanent thrall to French farmers. They produce too much food and there's the end of it. And no one here dares tell them to stop. These are the documents I think you'll find useful-- the tariff agreements. Oh good. The Brussels wine deal and the green power transfer balance rectification agreement. Self-explanatory. The minister relies on you. So, when do we start? Nice to see you. [music playing] [speaking french] Look at that. Bloody barbarians. [speaking french] [speaking french] You have many messages. They are very urgent. Please can you get me this number in London? [phone ringing] Pauline, is that you? PAULINE: Clara. Thank goodness we found you. What's happened? PAULINE: It's Simon. What? He's been taken to hospital. He was staying at Delia's. What was it? PAULINE: Appendicitis. Is he all right? PAULINE: Clara, you should know, we've been trying to get hold of you ever since the middle of last night. I gather-- well, they said you never came back. I must-- I just-- I must be with him. All I need-- look, it's just a silly thing. I'm short of money. I'll need to go to the embassy. Then I'll get the first plane. Tell him when he wakes, three hours. I can do it in three hours. PAULINE: Eight o'clock? With luck. Pauline, tell the boy I love him very much. MAN: I don't think anyone didn't see the opportunities-- Oh Lawrence, thank you. I'll tell you there is something, a credit card. Sir Arthur offered it to me today and I meant to take it. Of course. We could've sent it over. Why don't you come through? The landscape of course-- I mean the French do have landscape. And a lot of it, if you're honest is very, very nice, if you like canals. But you know they don't have countryside. I think countryside is something you only really get in England. Countryside to me means oaks. Hold on a minute. Here you are. Thank you. Do you know that girl over there? Yes, I do. Actually I've been asked to help look after it. She's a girl whose father has disappeared. I see. She came in completely hysterical, on no evidence. I mean he's only been gone less than 24 hours. He could be anywhere. But I think we've managed to calm her down a bit. You mean-- what? She was with him. Yes? CLARA PAIGE: In Paris. Why? Well no, I mean, most people who want-- who have some reason to vanish, well they don't do it with their daughter around. Well we don't know that he's vanished. It could've been an accident. Are you all right? You wanted this. May I use your phone? Gerald. Gerald, it's Clara. Yes. CLARA PAIGE: Pauline said the operation's over. Yes. CLARA PAIGE: And? He's doing fine. CLARA PAIGE: Is he awake? Just. He asked for you. Look, I-- when I spoke to Pauline, I said I'd be coming right over. I said I'd get a plane. And this is what I was intending. But you have to trust me. Just for the moment, I have to stay in Paris. Gerald. Gerald? Who is this man? CLARA PAIGE: What man? The man you were out with? We called you. We called you all night. CLARA PAIGE: Gerald. It's me. Does it seem likely? It was the man who rings the flat. What? GERALD PAIGE: A couple of times now. The man has run the flat and brought the phone down. Gerald, I know. I know what you're talking about. But I have seen to it. I promise you that will never happen again. Clara, I've been a bloody fool. You know that. It's that when you see this little boy, you realize-- well, I love him. I love you. We've both been beastly and callous of each other, me as much as you. You forget why you first married and the whole purpose of your life. When something like this happens, you realize, we must make an effort. Please, please come back to me. I want to see you tonight. Look, you know I want to. For some time I've wanted to settle things down. It's just, I can't promise. I do have a problem. I can't leave Paris right now. Work-- that's all there is for you. Eyes straight ahead, getting on. The idea of an affair even, how ridiculous. Not you, not Clara. Of a new model citizen unthinkable. And even now when your son is lying there-- CLARA PAIGE: Please, I'm sorry, but I-- What can be more important than your own son's illness? Now come back tonight. Jenny. Hello. I apologize. Just now I didn't recognize you. That's all right. I haven't seen you since you were at school. WOMAN: [speaking french] I know what you're thinking. It's not much of a life. CLARA PAIGE: I didn't say that. I wouldn't blame you. We're broke. That's why I'm frightened. I think he's done himself in. I used to love coming around to look after you. I remember being so jealous of your parents because at the time I had no children of my own. And you had that lovely house in Warsaw. When they needed a babysitter I'd volunteer. I liked your strictness. Was I strict? I wonder. JENNY SWANTON: I allowed no excuses, even though I was lame. I was so bored with everyone's expressions of concern. I've still got a picture. Look. Look at you and Gerald, so loving. CLARA PAIGE: Yes. He was once a very passionate man. Does your father ever mention me? JENNY SWANTON: Dad? Hmm. JENNY SWANTON: Only in passing. Once or twice lately. But I haven't seen him at all. It must be four years since I last saw Michael. He got a bit difficult. At the-- well, when the business went down, then things between us got very hard. I wanted-- I wondered whether he said anything to you. There'd been some confusion. Our names were meant to have been removed at company house. It turned out that they hadn't. Michael kindly said nothing. Of course our position was ethically correct. Also he told me Gerald gave him wrong information. Oh really? I've never heard that. When he took over the firm. What's it called? Creative accountancy. Dad didn't get a true picture of what debts he was inheriting. If that was so, when he found out, why didn't he go back and say something to Gerald? Because he's too nice. Will you stay? Just for this evening? I'd like to be able to talk. [crying] Eat. I can't. I'm so unhappy. What's that heresy they taught us at school? I don't know. Somewhere in the world for every bit of happiness somewhere else there a bit of unhappiness. It's called [inaudible]. For every rise there's a fall. Look. You think I blame you. You think dad blames you. But he doesn't. If he took a dead firm, it's nobody's fault but his own. Even if he was given the wrong figures, even if that's true, let's say it is. If he accepted it, then as far as I'm concerned that's his liability. [speaking french] And if he were here, he would tell you that's how he feels as well. He even has-- this is the extraordinary thing. He has the piece of paper Gerald gave him with the figures on. Where is it? JENNY SWANTON: This is my father. He put it away in a drawer. All he said was, "my foolishness." Oh yes, I love him very much. And now what? We come here, for me? He came for me? He wanted me to learn Italian because I longed to work in fashion. He said, learn the business, spend the summer with a family in Milan. With what? With what, daddy? He said, I'll sell the car. So I asked him to come with me just to give my mother a break. And I got the wrong bloody platform. What? We're not even meant to be in Paris. That's not possible. We got the wrong train at [inaudible].. I led him to the wrong fucking platform. I meant to be in fucking Milan, not in this fucking nightmare. Where is he? Where has he gone? [speaking french] No, really, honestly. He's not to do with any. You tell me. Somebody tell me. What do you want? What does everyone want? We sit here and eat dinner as if nothing has happened. CLARA PAIGE: Jenny! I'm going to go mad. Look! I'm sorry! No, wait. Look, I'll pay. [speaking french] Oh god, it'll take so long. [speaking french] [speaking french] Can we help? We're Americans. Oh, no thank you. It was someone I didn't know very well. She really was crazy. Yes. Well that's what happens when you try and help someone else. [phone ringing] MAN: Hello. How are you? I know who you are. CLARA PAIGE: Wallace, it's Clara. Clara. CLARA PAIGE: I'm at the hotel. I see. What do you mean? It's the middle of the night. Why will you only speak to me in the middle of the night? CLARA PAIGE: Wallace, I want to see you. All right. There you are. WALLACE SHARP: I had to bribe the concierge. I was frightened you might have gone. Did you find your handbag? No. It seems to be lost. What happened? Oh, you know, just thinking it over. Where are you going? I have to go. Why? Business. I have business in Rennes. Were you sloping off? Not really. Well, yes. Being tactful. I really want you. Good. Then I'll stay. I married early. I see. I was influenced by people I knew, contemporaries-- friends who seemed to make a mess of their lives. I don't like mess, promiscuity. I wanted to avoid the awful sloppiness people get into. Friends from school became hippies, no shape to their lives. A lot of us now are tired of all the old excuses. Just get on with things. It's been far too much living off the state. People get soft. They always think there's someone who'll solve their problems for them. That's softness. I see. People must make their own decisions. If you do something, you must live with the consequences. Goodness. Is that what you do? Don't you agree? It sounds very harsh. You're not like that. Aren't I? No, I don't think so. Or if you are, you have another side. Do I? Yes I think so. I've seen it. You've shown it to me. Why are you smiling? You're my first naked Tory. And you, do you have two sides to you? I change according to who I'm with. And with me? No. I'm not telling you yet. CLARA PAIGE: What's that you do? WALLACE SHARP: What? That? Don't you like it? CLARA PAIGE: I don't know. Don't do that. Oh, why not? Because then I can't leave you. No, I'll do it again. Is that what you fear? What? Not being free? Not being able to go off on your own? I always have. You're laughing. I'm happy. That's all. I want to charge breakfast to the government. Look. It's got a special code. So are you heading back to your conference? No, I can't. I've got to go to England. My-- What? My son's been ill. How do you mean? He had appendicitis. When? Oh, you know, recently. The night before last. You're joking. Why haven't you been with him? - It's tricky. I only heard last night. So why didn't you go? I am going. I'm just about to go. I'm just about to call. All right? He was ill. He had an operation. Now he's all right. I don't understand. I wish I could tell you. There's a whole lot of things. There are things I can't explain. Last night, I just thought-- oh god, I mean of course I wanted to go home. Are you mad? Of course I did. But the operation was over. Simon was fine. And I wanted to spend just one night with you. Was that wrong? You must tell me? Tell me please. Look at me, Wallace. Was that the wrong thing to do? [moaning] Mum! Mum! My god, Simon, I've missed you. WOMAN: Your mother's back, friend. Are you all right? Look, I brought you this. - [inaudible] made a 100. - Did he? It was brilliant. Oh, you. Pauline, there you are. How are you? How am I? Yes. Well I'm fine. Hello, darling. I'm back. He's being so brave. I just can't wait to get him home. Will you tell me a story? Of course I will. Any story? As long as someone dies. Why that? So I can do it. Look. That's terrible. Your eyes are fluttering. I thinking dead. It's not the same thing. Well? I think we should divorce. Oh yes. Why? It's obvious, isn't it? None of us can live in this atmosphere. Really? We always have. Look, I-- - Oh yes, I can see it would suit you. I'm an embarrassment. I'm getting old. I've seen you do it to everybody, ever since you were a girl. If you don't shape up, kick 'em out. That's not fair. I'll fight you for Simon. No. GERALD PAIGE: Oh yes. In the courts, in the papers, in public-- I've got nothing to lose. But you-- I'll get him. You wouldn't. GERALD PAIGE: I'll tell them what sort of mother you are. That you didn't come home when he was in hospital. Well did you? It doesn't look good. What do you want? GERALD PAIGE: Very little. If you've got a man, I would like to know. Adam, there you are. How good of you to come. I was delighted. I hear you did well in Paris. I did nothing. There are times when nothing's best. How do you like it? It's extraordinary. It's an independent outfit, of course, privately financed. Our job is to formulate new policy ideas and then sell them to the party. We're independent but we're terribly close. This is something we've got pretty good at, it's our media watch. We're always on the lookout for bias. They know we're watching. It means we have evidence and we want to prove preferential treatment. Terrific. WOMAN: Hello. LAWRENCE: And we're always poised to the right of the class. VOICE ON TV: And that's the way she escaped. Does it interest you? What? LAWRENCE: Working communication? Oh yes, very much. I'd love you to be my deputy here. [phone ringing] I have a series of theories about women. CLARA PAIGE: Really? This is my next book. I've done the family, now I'm doing this. You know, nowadays people pretend we're all the same, but we aren't, are we? Now what's exciting is how different we are. Women's behavior, their attitude, their gestures, their clothes, everything, express a fundamental need to submit. Submit? Uh huh. Is that what I'd do if I worked here? Submit? - If that would please you. Would I be paid as well? LAWRENCE: Oh, very good. You're quick. I always knew we'd get off. WOMAN: I did! Bye! WOMAN: Goodbye. WOMAN: See you tommorow. WOMAN: Bye. MAN: Good evening, Matthew. MAN: Good evening, sir. LAWRENCE: Hello? I know what you're doing. Hello Who is this? CLARA PAIGE: I know who you are. Who is it? Clara? MAN: Please, madam. Please. I thought this was a gentleman's club. This isn't a gentleman. She has no sense of humor. CLARA PAIGE: Get your hands off me. I never understand why women can't take a joke. It's this way. MAN: The new chosen candidate in the forth-coming Parliamentary election for Birmingham Southwest, where she was born, politician, mother, business-woman, and now our future MP, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Clara Paige. [applause] CLARA PAIGE: I think everyone wonders, those of you who know me, who've been with me, you look at me and think, ah, yes, there's Clara Paige, always there, always confident. Perhaps you think, no doubt she does a good job in Europe. But Europe's easy. How will she do at Westminster? That's the big test. Well yes it is different. Of course it's harder, more intense. I'm ready for that. I'm looking forward to it. Because you know, I think in a way, you have chosen me because we all share a feeling that we're sick up to here with [inaudible] and double-talk, and compromise. People are trying out to be led. Oh yes, always concerned, always want to know what you think, what you feel. But once I know, I think you deserve strong, decisive leadership. And as your representative in Parliament, I think I can promise you that that's what I'll provide. [applause] How nice to see you. Oh thank you so much. WOMAN: Would you like some tea? MAN: Oh that would be great. Janet. Mrs. Paige. CLARA PAIGE: My goodness. You do look well. How nice of you to remember me. Oh don't be ridiculous. That was a very nice speech. I just heard about Michael. I'm so sorry. I just want things to go on as normal. That's why I thought I'd come and help out today. Jenny said you were ever so kind to her. She wanted to thank you but she couldn't find you. No, I had to go home. In a funny way-- I shouldn't say this-- it's a blessing. Jenny got a great job in Italy. Michael, you know-- he wasn't a happy man, not for years. He'd been in agony. The odd thing is, now they've found him, we feel at peace. I'm glad. I do mean for Michael. I'm glad for everyone else. That was fantastic. You must be very happy. I've never been happier. Well people like you up here. They like the way you talk. They understand you. Good. I like them as well. Will you be driving back to London? I think I've earned a break. You certainly have. I'm going to spend the night at my hotel. Wallace. I was in the audience-- loyal admirer. I brought you this. I'd given it up. I bought another. I couldn't phone you, because of Gerald. It's been torture. I've missed you. Oh really? It's wonderful to see you. How did you get in? I read about your ex-partner. God yes, it was awful. WALLACE SHARP: They fished him out of the sand. That's right. I see now why you were so hysterical that night. Do you know where the police found the bag? On the [inaudible]. It hadn't been stolen, it was handed in. Go on, say-- Say what? WALLACE SHARP: Anything. - Like what? - React. How extraordinary. I didn't go that way. Well I didn't. WALLACE SHARP: Quick. Quicker, Clara. Think up a new lie. Improvise. You're meant to be smart. You've committed a crime. Insulting the intelligence. It ought to carry 10 years. Look. All right, I'll tell you. How much do you know? I honestly believe this man Swanton was following me. He'd been trying to blackmail me, or so I thought. I was terrified. There had been these calls. I tipped him over. It was an impulse. I so wanted to tell you before. Look, my darling, I was crazy. I admit it. You can't imagine what I've been through. I'm not a killer. I won't kill again. I made an honest mistake, for which I'm always going to suffer. Inside? CLARA PAIGE: Yes. Isn't inside enough? What you say about murder is what makes you so English. You told me once people should answer for their actions, whether they speak in a posh voice or not. Wallace, what are you saying? You haven't been to the police. Think about it. The whole thing's over. There were no witnesses. I have a son. Think what would happen to him if I went to prison. And Gerald, he's not a bad man, he just got in a mess financially and he chose a silly way out. These things happen. That's all. And you, why should you be justice? Why should it be you who weighs these things on the scales? It's not right. You'd always be sorry. Bury it. Honestly, you must. You're corrupt. You have no character. Words come out, but there's nothing in you. It isn't true. You're lost if there's no agenda, and there's no agenda tonight. That's not true. Why do you think I came to your flat in the middle of the night after I killed him? I came because I needed you. It was a most terrible risk. I came because I loved you. Don't be ridiculous. I didn't know, not then. WALLACE SHARP: You just needed company. Yes, at the start. I needed help. But later, no, it was real. I came to find you because I wanted to be sure. I've been used. You can't use people. CLARA PAIGE: No! No! No! Wallace! Wallace. Please. Let go of me. I need you. Don't go. Please. I'll care for you, I promise. There is a different side to me. That's what you once said. Don't you remember? A side of me that's decent. You said it. Remember? Please, look at my, darling. Can't you see? Look into my eyes. How can I be lying? That old side of me is bound up in you. You know there's some good. You know that there's good in me. I've been offered a job. Where? In Burma. They need my light fittings. [phone ringing] Answer it please. GERALD PAIGE: Hello? Yes, who is it? GERALD PAIGE: Hello? WALLACE SHARP: It's a man. Stop calling me. I told you, stop calling me. Will you never leave me alone? We'll drive together to London. When we get there we'll tell Gerald everything. But, Clara, you must tell him what you did. I will, and about us. He wants a divorce just as much as I do. Wallace. All right. It's time to be honest. If we're honest we can make a fresh start. PAULINE: Gerald! Yes. It's 2:30. I know. I'm sorry. Parliamentary business. Can't tell me what. Do you think you could take care of the boy? PAULINE: When will you be back? Clara will be back in the morning. Daddy? It's fine. MAN [ON RADIO]: His own arrangements [inaudible],, including Red Garland and later tonight, featuring Dizzy Gillespie, whose originally 1948 recording of, "A Night in Tunisia," is being requested by all those insomniacs out there. - Do you want me with You - No. Just wait here. You killed Swanton. Gerald. You're having an affair. You think you can get away with anything-- no regard for anyone's feelings but your own. You're trash. You're just trash. You're human trash. And trash belongs in the dustbin. CLARA PAIGE: You stupid man. You big stupid man. Why did you write him a letter putting the figures down? How could you? How could you do anything so incredibly stupid? Because that's what I'm like. I'm weak, and I don't think of the consequences. [gunshots] [music playing]
