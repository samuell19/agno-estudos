[PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] It's him. Hi. MAN: There he is. [TALKING STOPS] Over there. Captain's on board. Captain McVay, sir. MAN 1: Line handler, get that line around the quarter inch. LINE HANDLER: Aye, aye, sir. MAN 2: All right, handler. Take it on out. Aye, aye, sir. That ought to hold it, Major. You sure that thing will release easily? Yes, sir. What's in that thing anyway, sir? Get out of here. Don't mind our Frankie, Major, he's not long from the breast. How many times I gotta tell you you should keep your mouth shut? Don't... Well, she's all yours, Captain Wilkes. Twenty-four hours, round the clock. That is your baby. Very good, Major. What do you think is in that, Kinderman? A buddy of mine in the State Department told me that's 5,000 rolls of scented toilet paper for General Douglas MacArthur. Seems he's getting tired of usin' his orders to wipe his butt on. All prepared to get underway, sir. Very well, Commander. Have the crew stand by. Aye, aye, sir. Captain, is that what all this hush-hush is about? It's kind of spooky seeing it there, like somebody lying in state. [WHISTLE BLOWING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] MAN ON PA: Thomas to DiAngelo. Thomas to DiAngelo. Report to the Captain in his sea cabin. All right. Take it, chief. I'm goin' topside. ...Captain in his sea cabin. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come. Lieutenant DiAngelo, welcome aboard. Congratulations on your promotion. Thank you, sir. I'm looking forward to my first cruise as chief engineer. I understand you've served on a destroyer before the Indianapolis. That's right, sir. Convoy run. Sit down. Sit down.Thank you. Lieutenant, this mission is of a somewhat different nature. I'm wanna make this run in record time. Which means I'm gonna need everything she can give me every inch of the way, all the time. Yes, sir. Now, I expect the Indianapolis to be as squared away below decks as she is topside. I'd like to see your report at 0800. Aye, aye, sir. And Lieutenant, good luck. Thank you, Captain. Mail call, mail call. Don't bother gettin' up. Ain't nothin' here for nobody but Dobson. Got a winner. Five, gentlemen, five. Four from admirin' females, one from family. How come you get so much mail, Joe? I'm very attractive to women. [CHUCKLING] Oh. What's the matter? You didn't get any mail, Frankie? Not so far. I don't know anybody, really. Here, you can have one of mine. Oh, no... I mean, isn't it private? No, no. That's from my kid sister, Elly. And there's nothin' in it you can't read. She just writes whatever comes into her nut. Wow. You can even write her back for me, if you want. She'd probably like to get one back before the war's over. ELLY: Dear Joseph, I wonder how long before you get this letter, and how long before you write back to me. I miss you a lot. We all do, but especially me. I'm the kid sister, right? And kid sisters just naturally dote on their handsome, hero big brothers. WILKES: Guard bow, turn to! Hut! Steady. Change! MAN ON PA: Now, lay before the mast all 0800 reports. That is, now lay before the mast all 0800 reports. Bow hands, hut! You seagoin' bellhops are really keepin' an eye on this thing, ain't you? Shove off, deck ape. Must be a pretty important piece of gear. You're posting a 24-hour guard on it. Scuttlebutt up in the officer's country says she's crucial to the war effort. Hey, you know what's inside this thing? What's your seventh general order, Marine? Talk to no one except in line of duty, sir. A Marine on duty has no friends. Isn't that right, Cortez? Aye, aye, sir. Semper fi, do or die. Know what I mean, Cortez? Carry on. My apologies, Major. I'm afraid coffee's the strongest liquid they'll allow on board. Just as well, sir. This is your father, isn't it? Right. Charles Butler McVay II. I'm the third. And the other gentleman's the first. My grandfather. Both Navy. Both admirals. Seems admirals run in the McVay bloodline. I'm not sure it's an inherited trait. Well, this mission certainly won't do your record any harm. You know that the Navy picked their best for this one. Thank you, Major. Captain, aren't you the least bit curious about what it is you're carrying? Petty Officer Kinderman has it on absolute authority we're carrying personal toilet articles for General MacArthur. I think it's safe to say that it's something more important than that. Are you trying to tell me something I don't need to know, Major? Captain McVay, what I'm trying to tell you is that, that cargo out there on your foredeck is a major component of the deadliest damn weapon the species has come up with to date, and frankly, sir, I'd be more than a little surprised if the Navy hadn't seen fit to inform the officer responsible for delivering it. Well, maybe they have. And, then again, maybe they think I'd handle the situation the same way no matter what it is we're carrying, even if it is toilet paper for General MacArthur. Well, sir, here's Godspeed to us all. There's a lot riding on this, like an end to this damn war. What's the problem, sailor? I got a really bad pain in my gut, sir. Goldstein, how are your bowels? You constipated? Oh, no, sir. I ain't constipated. Not with the chow they serve on this bucket, you know? How long have you had the pain? Ever since I heard the Dodgers score. No, I'm... I'm not sayin' that was the cause of it. That's just when it started. Who beat 'em?Philly. It was a fluke. We're leading 2-1, goin' into the bottom of the ninth inning... Put Goldstein on a bland diet and keep him away from the baseball scores. If it doesn't clear up within two days, Goldstein, put yourself on a regular sick call. Aye, aye, sir. Gentlemen, there have been lots of rumors flying around the bridge as to the nature of this mission. I'm not surprised. Now, I'm sure that you've noticed, we are maintaining maximum speed on all watches. I know you'd like to know where we're headed and why. Now, this much I can tell you. You're outward bound for the fair shores of Tinian Island, here, in the Marianas. At our present speed, we should arrive Thursday morning, no later than 1100. Any questions? Some of the men say that Betty Grable is living in that crate on the foredeck. Absolutely untrue. Miss Grable is in my cabin. [ALL LAUGHING] Captain, what about the submarine threat in these waters? I haven't noticed any mandatory orders about sailing in a zigzag pattern. Well, as far as we know, the Japanese are pretty short on everything, including submarines. What they have left, however, they've begun to outfit with something new, called Kaitens. Now, Kaitens, for you army types, are torpedoes manned by human beings. Sort of underwater kamikazes. They're very fast, very expendable. You get one of those boys in your tail and zigzagging wouldn't mean a thing. The pilot just recalculates his attack angle and takes another run at your midships. Now, their weakness is range. We're not exactly sure how much that is, but I think the best way to deal with them is to try and outrun them. That's why I've asked Lieutenant DiAngelo to make all speed. How fast are we doing, Lieutenant? We're a little better than 28 knots, Captain. Good. Faster than the mental processes of all but admirals, eh? But slower than Kaitens. That's correct, Major. But, in my judgment, the best way to deal with them is to outrun them, rather than trying to outmaneuver them. That'll be all, gentlemen. You're dismissed. Miss Grable's expecting me. Yes, sir. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [MAN SPEAKING ON RECEIVER] MAN 1: Easy, now. Easy, easy, to the right. MAN 2: More to my side. More slow. Slow. That's it. MAN 2: Here it comes, guys. MAN 1: Bring her in, men. [INDISTINCT TALKING] Watch your feet.More towards you. Easy. Push. [MEN WHOOPING] All right. That's it. Let's go. Captain McVay, once again, thanks for the ride. It's been a pleasure, Major Green. You know, this really has been a historic voyage. I'm glad to hear it, Major. I've always wanted to be on one of those. Very well, sir. I'll be going ashore. McVAY: Bring that 20mm magazine up here. MAN: Aye, aye, sir. Captain McVay. Hello, Padre. Welcome aboard. Thank you, sir. It's good to have you with us. I'm sure your presence will help elevate the quality of conversation in the wardroom. You make me feel rather like a maiden aunt, sir. [CHUCKLING] I want all those magazines loaded and ready to go. MEN: Aye, aye, sir.Aye, aye, sir. Father, the men are not too happy about the prospect of heading out to Leyte without any shore leave, so you may find the level of profanity fairly high for the next couple of days. Well, I'll pray for all concerned, sir. We have 1,196 souls that need saving. Does that include yours, Captain? No, Father. Mine already belongs to the Navy. Carry on. Thank you, sir. [MEN CLAMORING] MAN ON PA: Now, all hands secure from abandon-ship drill. All hands secure from abandon-ship drill. That was a total disaster. Substandard. Thoroughly unacceptable. Believe me, I know most of our crew are young and green as grass, but, gentlemen, we are due to make Leyte Tuesday morning. So, I wanna see a marked improvement by then. Do I make myself clear? ALL: Aye, aye, sir. Good. Let's turn to and start making ourselves very unpopular with the crew. Helm, stand by to commence zigzag. First turn will be starboard. Ever known zigzagging to help, Lieutenant? Heard a lot of sub men say it's a waste of time. Well, maybe you'd like to go back and discuss it with Captain McVay, Petty Officer. Oh, no, no, no. Captain says he wants me to zigzag, I'll zigzag. Want me to steer her straight, I'll steer her straight. I'm here to serve, sir. This better be good, Goldstein. I just left Errol Flynn about to capture Burma. [SCREAMS] Sorry, sir. Don't let it get back to Brooklyn, Goldstein, but you've got yourself a pretty sick stomach. I'll give you something to quell it. It good enough to get me off the watch bill, sir? It's good enough to get you a depth charge and a night in sickbay. Orderly, put Petty Officer Goldstein in the rack closest to the head. [GROANING] [BELL CLANGING] Good evening, Captain. Scott. I didn't see you at our movie tonight. I though Errol Flynn was your kind of guy. Actually, I don't find motion pictures about the war all that informative. No. Well, they're meant for the civilian population, I imagine. My own experience of the Japanese is that they are excellent troops with enviable discipline. If you'll excuse me. Oh. Absolutely. It seems to have settled in pretty thick, sir. I think we can hold a steady course now. Well, that should please Petty Officer Kinderman, sir. McVAY: Oh?Mmm. I wasn't aware that Mr. Kinderman was displeased. No, sir. Kinderman was asking if zigzagging was of any real value, sir. Oh. The general theory is that if you happen to take a hit at midships while in the process of zigzagging, the chances are zigzagging didn't make much sense to begin with. So, while the moon's behind those clouds, we'll hold our course steady at 2-4-0, make turns for 24 knots. If that meets with your approval, Mr. Kinderman. Aye, aye, sir. And Lieutenant, if there's any change in the weather conditions, you'll notify me at once. Aye, aye, sir. Captain off the bridge. Helm, that'll be steady on course 2-4-0. Aye, aye, sir. 2-4-0 she is. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SHOUTING IN JAPANESE] [SONAR BEEPING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] MAN: Oh, boy. You got the right idea there, sailor. It's not much better out here. [SIGHING] I'm sweatin'. [MAN COUGHING] [SONAR BEEPING] [SIGHS] I'd rather have a sister in a cathouse than a brother as an officer. Smart-ass rich boys give me a pain in the butt. Hey, shove off, mate. Hey, Charlie, I hear you let your battleship mouth run over your rowboat butt again. That 90-day wonder, DiAngelo, just nailed me up on the bridge. Thought I had seen the last of him at Tinian. I'm supposed to have me a set of orders off this haze gray hotel. Well, you're here for the duration, I'd say. Now, shut up and deal. [SONAR BEEPING] [EXCLAIMS] FRANKIE: Dear Miss Dobson... Elly, I have never really written a letter before to anybody and I never wrote to anybody I don't know. But pen pals do it all the time, I guess. But that's different. I guess. Anyway. I'm on the ship, the same as your brother Joe, except I see you call him Joseph. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [INDISTINCT TALKING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [SIGHING] CHARLIE: Got the cowboys. Looks like I'm cleanin' you boys out. [MEN SCREAMING] Come on! [MEN GROANING] Get up! Up! Get up! [SCREAMING] Easy, sailor. Easy. Hey, don't touch those engines! We carry out the last order from the bridge. Maintain current speed. Aye, aye, sir. How bad, Commander? No report from Damage Control. We've taken a hit forward, sir. [THUDDING][ALL GROANING] [GROANING] [EXPLOSIONS] All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go! [MEN CLAMORING] MAN 1: Can anybody get forward?MAN 2: No. [MEN CLAMORING] Let's go! Go. Guys, I think we got hit. Come on, Charlie. Come on. Yeah, yeah. I'm goin'. Hey, buddy. What's going on? [HISSING] Keep trying the engine room. Zach, make sure we're sending out the mayday. Aye, aye, sir. Heavy smoke and fire below decks, Captain. We're takin' water fast. How's she handling? Answering the helm, sir, but it's real mushy. We can abandon ship, sir. Not until we've heard from Damage Control. We still might be able to save her. Pass the word. General quarters. All hands on deck. MAN: Aye, aye, sir. Faber, get down below. Have them shut down those engines. FABER: Yes, sir. [PANTING] Come on, Doc. Leave him, now. Leave him. Come on. Come on. Let's go. [HISSING] [EXPLOSIONS] [GROANING] [GASPING] [MEN SCREAMING] MAN: What's the word from the bridge? [MEN CLAMORING] What can I do? Sir. On any injured man. Do you understand me? Injured men! Aye, aye, sir. Aye, aye, sir. [SIZZLING] [SCREAMING] [VALVE BURSTS] [SCREAMING] Oh, God! [MEN COUGHING] MAN 1: Everybody, get the rafts down! MAN 2: We can't get the floater nets down! Quick! What's the word from the bridge? MAN 1: Has anybody seen the Boatswain? MAN 2: Shouldn't we abandon ship? MAN 3: Has anybody heard... MAN 4: Get those people down first! MAN 5: Come on! Get some help up here! Should we abandon ship? What do we do, sir? MAN: She's going down! Everybody, over the side, into the water! Go! Go! Come on out! Into the water! Come on! [MEN SCREAMING] Oh, my God. MAN: Swim away from the ship! Move away! Pass the word to abandon ship, Boatswain! Aye, aye, sir. All hands off the bridge! MAN: Help me! My leg! Captain? [EXPLOSIONS] The radio room is unreachable, sir. Thank you, Commander. Prepare to abandon ship. [GROANING]Here, take this. Over the side. [MEN SCREAMING] [SHIP CREAKING] Cortez! Cortez! Cortez! He's dead. He's dead! Get over the side! Get over the side! [EXPLOSIONS] [CREAKING] [GASPS] Is anybody out here? [GRUNTING] [COUGHING] Is anybody out here? Oh, God, not just me. Please, God, not just me. Is anybody out here? FRANKIE: And then, Elly, I was in the water, and, strangest of all, after so many men and so much activity, I was absolutely alone, not a single soul to be seen or heard. So strange. I can't believe it's really happening, and I, and I pray to God I'm gonna awaken. [MAN GRUNTING] Over here, sailor! You can make it. Grab my hand. I got you. You're there. [BOTH GRUNTING] [COUGHING] You okay?Yes, sir. Are there any others? I kept moving to the end stern. Did you see any others? I don't know. [PANTING] If there are, they're strung out for miles. Miles and miles, sir. We gotta find them. [COUGHING] [MEN COUGHING] So many men. They're so spread out. Zach, where can I get them to bunch up? It's gonna be hard to keep count. Did we get a message out? I don't know. Equipment was working. There was time. [MEN CLAMORING] Stop it! Stop it! [CLAMORING] Stop fighting! Shut up! Stop it! Stop thrashing around! Do you wanna attract sharks? Come on, there's a lot of injured men out there. Give them a hand.Yes, sir. Sorry.It's all right. Find an injured man for that jacket. [MAN SHIVERING] Hey, there. Hang on to me. Hang on. It's okay, buddy. I'm gonna give you this jacket. Damn it.GOLDSTEIN: Hiya, Doc. Believe it or not, my gut feels a whole lot better. It's good to see you, Goldstein. It's good to see you, too. How are we doin', sir? If we were all doin' as well as you, we'd be fine. Help me out, will you? We gotta get this kapok on him. What's the matter with your hands, Doc? I'm not worth a dime. Come on. Good man, Goldstein. We gotta get these men closer together. They're too spread out. Yes, sir. It's okay, buddy. It's okay. [INDISTINCT TALKING] I got you.Yeah. Fifty or 60, best as I can count. We're in pretty bad shape. How many life vests? I'd say about half. We gotta get 'em on the injured. Help me get his off. What are you doin'? He doesn't need it anymore, Lieutenant. He can make it, Captain. Help me. You got him? MAN: All right, people, listen up! What we're gonna do is keep the wounded afloat. FRANKIE: I now have three life vests, Elly. Which is more than I can use, but is perhaps less than I need. But soon I will find some of my shipmates. Then I can distribute them as I was doing on the ship before it sank. I am sure now that it did sink, and that this is not just a dream. McVAY: How long have you been in the Navy? BOATSWAIN: I've been in the Navy for 12 years and six months now, sir. Married?Yes, sir. I've been married for eight years, sir. You got any kids? Two kids. Girl's seven and a boy... Look over there. Ahoy! The raft! Who's there? BOATSWAIN: Identify yourselves! Look, over there. Ahoy! Let's pick 'em up. MAN 1: Come on, come on. Climb over. MAN 2: Keep it straight. Throw me that line. Hello, Padre. Hello, Skipper. Hey, can you squeeze a couple of us on your raft? I think so. Boatswain, help some of these men aboard. Aye, aye, sir. Did you see the others? Not yet. We all just found each other. There's bound to be more of us. Sir, I think you ought to bring everyone aboard now. All hands out of the water! On the double! Get out of the water. MAN 1: Get out. Get your feet out. MAN 2: Give me your hand! [MEN SIGHING] MAN 1: Get off of here.MAN 2: Let me on. MAN 1: Get off!MAN 3: There's no room. [MEN GRUNTING] You can't get on here. Hey! Let me on!All right, all right. What do you need? What do you need? How many men we got here? We got six. We're full. I count four, sailor. We have wounded men in the water, Kinderman. Now, if we start bringing them over, I want the uninjured to give up their places. We got wounded here as it is, Lieutenant. Then I'll leave it to each man to decide whether he's worse off than the man replacing him. How many places do you think that's gonna free up, Lieutenant? Yours for one, Kinderman. Yours for one. Now get in the water. Get in the water, now. Hey, let's go. [MEN GROANING] [MEN GROANING] Hang on. [MEN SHIVERING] Commodore Hathaway, this is Lieutenant Commander Olinsky. At ease, Olinsky. Get all settled in over Tacloban? Yes, sir. Lieutenant Robinson, here, give you some idea of what you're up against? Lot of traffic, sir. More to come, if this invasion of Japan gets underway. Better hope they decide to quit while they're behind. Any news from CINPAC he should know? Not right now, sir. I noticed CINPAC orders that we don't report combatant vessel arrivals. Just wondered why that was, sir. Because the less the enemy knows of the whereabouts of our fighting ships, the safer they will be. It's good to have you aboard, Olinsky. It seems pretty chaotic, but don't be fooled. It's a lot worse than it looks. Carry on. Aye, aye, sir. How long have you been here on Leyte? I've always been here. Always will. It's my favorite island. Where was it you wanted to go first, sir? I've been trying to catch up with a Christmas package for eight months. Hoping it might be here. PRICE: Welcome to Leyte, sir. It may be a nightmare, but it's our nightmare. [MAN SCREAMING] [MEN CLAMORING] [SCREAMS] MAN: Don't panic. [SCREAMING] Let's feed him Jimmy. He won't mind. Come on, let's take his shirt off. If they get enough of these dead guys, maybe they won't eat the rest of us. Here comes the shark! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] Cortez, Cortez, Cortez, name three main groups of the M1 rifle. Come on. Stock group, barrel and receiver group, trigger housing group. Main characteristics? Shoulder-fired, clip in, air-cooled, gas-operated. Again. Shoulder-fired, clip in, air-cooled, gas-operated, semiautomatic, sir. [PANTING] Are you all right? Yes, sir. [MEN SIGHING] I should have gone down with the ship. Why didn't I? Why did I survive? I think it's time to trust in providence, Captain. [CHUCKLES] Providence covers a lot of territory, Father. The question is, does that include the Navy? We're in a war. Ships get sunk. The Navy understands that. After all, you did complete your mission. I don't think there can be any questions of anything except our bad luck. I just had the feeling that everything... Everything has already happened. But you only find out about it when it catches up with you. [MAN COUGHING] In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of Heaven and Earth, and Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, conceived by the Holy Ghost, born to the Virgin Mary... SCOTT: Stay together. Those of you who don't have jackets, hold on to the ones who do. Those of you with kapok jackets, bunch up and tie them together. [SHIVERING] Sir.What is it? It's Commander Elias.How's he doing? He's asking me to untie his life vest. He's gonna die. [WHIMPERING] I know. I can't do it. It's okay, Goldstein. You're doing the best you can. It's okay. I'll take care of him. It's okay. Zach! Zach, it's me. [GROANING] Zach, how you doing? [FEEBLY] I can't untie the knot. Hang on, Zach. Help's on the way. Not for me, Doc. Not for me. Help me, please. [COUGHS] Okay, okay. Damn it! My hands. Skipper... Do you think he made it? I don't know. He probably went down with her. [GASPING] I want to... Alice to... My wife. I want her to marry again. Okay. I love her very, very much. You'll tell her, Steve. Please, please, can you tell her... Goldstein! Goldstein! Help! Let him go. Let him go. Let him go, okay? It's okay. It's okay. Let him go. Let him go. He's gone. It's okay. He's gone. [GOLDSTEIN SOBBING] GOLDSTEIN: Take me home. I want to go... [INDISTINCT TALKING] Mr. DiAngelo. Mr. DiAngelo. [GRUNTING]It's me. It's Wilkes. Captain Wilkes, I was home. I was home and I was in bed. Some of the men are drinking salt water. I've seen it before. We've gotta stop it right away. It'll make them crazy. Are you with me?Yeah. Come on. Gentlemen, you get down maybe 10, 15 feet and the water's not salt. Yeah. Deeper you go, the purer it gets. MAN: Is that true? I'm tellin' you. Want me to get you some? MEN: Yeah. Go, go, go, go. Okay. Comin' up. Gangway, sailors. Gangway. What is happening here, people? Shorty just went under to get us a drink of fresh water. Secure him. Secure him. Take him. Secure him. Don't drink that water. Listen up, people. Listen up. [MEN LAUGHING] Any man that drinks salt water again is gonna lose his vest. It's fresh. WILKES: Shut up! You understand me? You're first. What, you want me to start with you? No, no, no, no. Give it over! You've lost your life vest. No, no, no!Do you understand me? Am I clear? WILKES: Okay, you...Hear what's happenin', shrimp? [LAUGHING] WILKES: Let's go! Over here!Help! MAN: Help! PADRE: Over here! Down here! Look down here! MAN 1: Over here!MAN 2: Over here! Can't you hear, pal? That's the second one we've seen that didn't see us. Well, maybe he did. Maybe he's radioing our position right now. Yeah, maybe so. You can't give up. They'll be back, and when they come, they'll bring more planes and more ships. They'll find us. You've got to believe that. Just hang on. We're gonna make it. You understand? All of us! We're gonna make it! Yes, sir. He's back. He never left. [MEN CLAMORING]MAN: Get in the raft! Get on. Get in! Get in.Get in. Our Father, who art in Heaven, BOTH: hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. ALL: Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. [ORCHESTRA PLAYING LOUDLY] So you want to be on Broadway, huh? Well, you've come to the right place, Nurse Danielson. Are you in show business, Lieutenant? I, in show... I am in one of the longest running tragifarces in showbiz history. I give you The War in the Pacific. May it run forever. I mean... Well, until tomorrow morning, at least. Lieutenant! Lieutenant Tasker! Can't hear you. He's got the music up too loud. Lieutenant Tasker! [WHISTLING] Shall we? Shouldn't you... When it's important, they'll wade out to me. What they're doing now is hovering. Okay. Go tell Lieutenant Tasker we're back on duty. Why me? He'll kill me for spoiling his fun. Coward. What're you doing? I'm going to cut in. [CHUCKLING] Hey, look, somebody's comin'. It's that damn Marine. Look at him go. He swims like Tarzan. I think maybe we should put this stuff away. What's he gonna do? Haul us back to a court-martial? I think we should put it away. Listen. This ain't the Navy anymore. All that, "Yes, sir," "No, sir," "Saluting sir," "Aye, aye, sir." It's all finished. See this? This is it. It's every man for himself. You men are too far from the main group. We must've drifted in the night, sir. How many men on this raft? I count three. We got one more down below here. Wounded real bad. There are men who need this raft. What about us? Aren't we men? Don't we need this raft? Don't we need it? You got somethin' to hide, sailor? Charlie... Gangway. I'm coming aboard. Well. DOBSON: Charlie? I'm ordering you off this raft. You're orderin' nothin'. Get the hell out of here. Gangway! Come on. Charlie! [GRUNTING] I want you on your feet. What are you doing? Hey. Don't you know where you are, Marine? You're in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You are on report, mister. You are on report. All right. Okay! [BOTH GRUNTING] Charlie! Charlie! You are under arrest! [GRUNTING]You are... Charlie! Charlie! He's gone. He's gone. No, no, no. He was always gone. Hey! Where you goin'? Don't expect to come back here and get back on this raft. MAN: I'm with Dobson. PETE: Me, too. What do you mean? Hey, where you goin'? Petey! Wait a second.I'm goin'. They're not gonna come after us. They're lookin' for someone to blame this whole thing on! We'll get medals just for makin' it. Don't you understand? We'll all be heroes. FRANKIE: When I get home, we'll lie in the hammock and just swing back and forth. It's like you were floating. You'd like it, Elly. It's a big enough hammock for two. I'm not very big. [FRANKIE LAUGHS] I ain't a midget, you understand? We'll just lie in the hammock, swinging, swinging, swinging... MAN 1: Here it comes. MAN 2: [PANICKING] It's coming again. MAN 3: Get on the raft! [AIR HISSING] Get the injured men and the equipment over here. [MEN CLAMORING] [MAN SCREAMING] Get out of the way!Hold on! Hold on! [GRUNTING] Hold on. Calm down. Don't panic. I think he's gone for now, sir. [MEN SOBBING] We'll take turns with the watch, every two hours. [MAN GROANING] She's all yours, Joseph. Yeah, let me know if you see anything except clear blue water. The more you stare, the less you see. What's that mean? Keep watching. Stop thinking. Don't tell your eyes. Let your eyes tell you. Out-bound leg completed. New heading, 2-7-0 magnetic for two hours. Well, then let there be no deviation from the flight plan. Okay, Carl. Call me when we're ready to go home. Takin' over. On bearing 172.I got it. What is it, sir, a submarine?There's somethin' down there. What did you see, sir? [MEN SCREAMING] Did you hear it? The plane? Listen. Listen! There's more of 'em. There's dozens. There must be 100 or more. TASKER: It's your plane, Joe. Who are they? Are they Japs? Just a bunch of poor drowning bastards. TASKER: Bring us around hard, Joe, and get us down over the water. [MEN CHEERING] It must be a surface vessel. There's too many for a sub. They must be us. The Japs don't have any surface vessels for 400 miles. Tell them it looks as bad as they can imagine and then some. About the fuel, sir. We have to start back soon or we won't make it. You go send that message, Carl, and then we'll talk about fuel, okay? Okay. I just thought you should know. I know. It'll just have to wait. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I'm doing the best I can with the resources at hand, Admiral. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. As soon as possible. Yes, sir. Do these people know there's a war on? We have a report of large numbers of men in the ocean several hundred miles due east of here, sir. What do you mean "large numbers"? In excess of 300, sir. What's out there? Well, sir, the Indianapolis should have reached port yesterday. We've got her marked off our boards, but there's no confirmation from Port Authority. Yes, sir, but standing orders are explicit, sir. Arriving combatant ships are not to be reported, sir. How about non-arriving combatant ships, Lieutenant? I think you better take this, sir. [TYPEWRITERS CLACKING] Lieutenant Commander Olinsky, sir. Can I be of some help? What do you have on the Indianapolis,Olinsky? She was due yesterday and we've taken her off our board. I know you don't report combatant vessels. You do notice if they arrive or not, don't you? No, sir. What exactly is the problem with the Indianapolis,sir? Who's on the Indianapolis? Charlie McVay, sir. God help him. We're low on fuel, Lieutenant. I mean, we're not gonna make it back. Well, better put her down, then. Where? Here? Good a place as any. Relax, guys. It looks pretty rough down there. She'll make it. She'll make it. Might not get her off again, but what the hell? The taxpayers have gotten their mileage out of this baby. Now, you tell 'em that, owing to a fuel shortage, we're putting down near a group of floaters. Carl, now you give them our position loud and clear. Okay? Okay, hold tight. She's gonna jump. It's sent. They know we're down. [MEN CLAMORING] It's one of ours! Captain! Captain Wilkes! Captain! That's the Japs. That's an old trick. We swim over there, they're gonna machine-gun us. That's crazy. They will. You'll see. It's Japanese! [SHOUTING] Captain! [ALL CLAMORING] Captain Wilkes! Where's Captain Wilkes? Captain Wilkes is dead, sir. Captain Wilkes is dead? What are we gonna do, sir? Keep calm. We got to keep the men calm, sailor. We gotta keep them calm. We gotta get the men to the plane. We're almost there. Keep them calm. Keep them... All right, keep calm! We're almost there. We gotta hold on. We gotta hold on. We're almost there. Are you sure it was a plane, sir? Positive. It was heading north. That was over two hours ago. Give me the flare pistol. It's loaded. Shooting stars, Elly. Make a wish. We don't know that either, sir. Yes, there was a report picked up from a Japanese submarine claiming a kill, but we've gotten used to discounting those. Yes, sir. I will, sir. That was Nimitz. Things are starting to get pretty squirrelly. What have you got? We have the Cecil J. Doyleen route at the present time. The Talbot, the Madison,the Uranus are the other vessels closest to the reported sightings. Send them. How long have those men been in the water? If the Jap reports are accurate, about 72 hours, sir. [SCREAMING] [SOBBING] MAN 1: Jap!MAN 2: I see one. What? What?Where? Come on! [MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY] There's a raft! Over there. Over there. Over here. There's a raft over here. There's a raft there. Unbelievable. Yeah. [GASPS IN PAIN] [GROANS] Japs. I got one. I got one. [MAN LAUGHING]MAN 1: Yeah. Shorty got a Jap. Take the boat! Come on. Get it off. Hey, climb aboard. SHORTY: I got him. Those bastards are everywhere. [MAN SNIFFLING] [MAN MUTTERING] Sir, sir, help me get these guys over to the plane. No, I can't lose my place in line. We gotta get to the hotel. I need a rest. Just 15 minutes in a room. Take it easy, Doc. Easy. Fifteen minutes. No! No! Don't worry. It's okay, Doc.Let go! What if they don't have any rooms? Hang on. We're all gonna get a room. [SOBBING] I gotta get a room. We're all gonna get a room. All these guys are gonna get a raft. Us, too, Doc. Come on. Us, too. You gotta give me a room. [MUMBLING] [SHUSHING] Hang on. You're all right. You're all right. Come on. Come on. I'll lift you up. [GROANING] [GRUNTING] What ship are you from? Huh? What ship are you from? The Indianapolis. The Indianapolis. [MEN SIGHING] Come on, guys. Get those ships here. Sir? Sir, there's a light on the horizon. Could that be a ship? Maybe. Yeah. Yeah, that is a ship. And it's headin' towards us. They found us. They found us. A ship! Padre. [MEN MUTTERING] Wake up, Padre. They found us. We made it. Padre? Padre! [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] MAN ON PA: Bridge, forecastle. I've got a raft two points off the starboard bow. MAN 2 ON PA: Now on deck, stand by to hoist out number two motor whaleboat. [FEEBLY] I'm expecting a letter. Don't worry, son. We'll make sure you get it. Captain, the rest of the men have been picked up. MAN: You'll be fine, sailor. Captain. Sir, let me give you a hand. Abandon ship! Abandon ship. DOCTOR: We need to redress this. MALE NURSE: Yes, sir. [MAN COUGHING] How are you doin'? Fine, sir. I'll be all right. Well, they haven't let you out of here yet, huh? No, sir. Why should I leave? I have the life. Besides, these guys would miss me. [SHUDDERING] Lieutenant. Hey, Skipper. I talked to your folks last night. Did you talk to my mom? Told them you were okay and they send their love. Thanks, Captain. Captain. [SPLUTTERING] Captain. It's okay, Lieutenant. It's okay. I tried... You'll be home for Christmas. Nice tie, Goldstein. Oh, thank you, Skipper. How's the food in this joint? Terrible. They keep serving us fish. Hello, Commander. Captain? You made it. So did you. [SIGHING] How is he, Louise? He acts like, well, you know how he acts, all very under control. All by the book, as you'd say. Well, Charlie has what it takes. He's been getting a lot of phone calls lately. From reporters, I suppose. No, from parents and relatives from the men who were lost. They're saying terrible things to him. Dad, they're blaming him... It's understandable, Louise. It's human nature. Hello, Dad. Charlie, how are you? All right, all things considered. How are you? Fine, just fine. Go into the study, you two, and I'll get some coffee. It's a very difficult time with the Navy, Charlie. You just remember that. The Pearl Harbor inquiry is potentially a very damaging business. This would be a most unfortunate time to start dragging out a lot of stuff about inefficiency and administrative confusion. Dad, 880 men are dead. That's a fact, a terrible fact. They can't just ignore that. Of course they can't ignore it. Well, what are they going to do? There will have to be a court-martial, Charlie. Hello, Charles. Jack. How's the Admiral? He's fine, thank you. Kind of you to ask. He's not here. Didn't expect him. You're looking well, Louise. Thank you. Well... Good luck, Charles. Thank you, Jack. [INDISTINCT TALKING] CHAIRMAN: Captain McVay, you're hereby charged with failure to give the order to abandon ship in time and hazarding your command by failure to zigzag in submarine-infested waters. How do you plead?Not guilty. You know, these charges against the Captain, they don't make any sense. We've gotta go in there and we've gotta tell them how it was. They don't wanna know how it was, Goldstein. What do you mean, "They don't wanna know," sir? MAN: Lieutenant DiAngelo. What the hell do they want to know? LIPSCOMBE: How long have you been in the Navy, Lieutenant? Since 1941. So, you have had four years' watch in wartime conditions? That's correct, sir. Was it your opinion that the U.S.S. Indianapolis, on the night in question, was being hazarded by not steering a zigzag course? No, sir. It was as murky a night as I'd ever seen. Would you have ordered such a course if you had deemed it necessary? Yes, sir. Absolutely. PROSECUTOR: Did you at any time hear the order to abandon ship? SCOTT: No, sir. How did you determine as to when to do so? When it became evident that the ship was going to capsize. LIPSCOMBE: In your assessment, how many men got off the ship, Commander? It's hard to say. It was dark. There was smoke, flames, a lot of wounded. It could have been 800, maybe 900. And how many men were rescued? I don't believe the number of men rescued is relevant to the charges against Captain McVay. Goldstein, for God's sake, sit your butt down. I don't get this. Don't they care about all those poor guys that drowned? It's not at the top of their list. It's like going to a funeral and not saying anything about the corpse. I'm gonna ask them just what's goin' on. Goldstein, you don't ask questions at a court-martial, you answer them. You answer the questions they ask you. On the night of July 29th, can you describe what happened, Petty Officer Goldstein? I had a bad case of the runs and the ship sank. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] LIPSCOMBE: Captain Guardino, you are holder of the following decorations, the Navy Cross, four times, the Silver Star, twice, the Bronze Star, three times. Is that correct? Yes, sir. So for all practical purposes, we can assume you are an expert on submarine attack procedures? I guess so. Captain, of the 28 vessels you sank during your service, how many were not zigzagging at the time? None. Based on your experience, what is the value of zigzagging to a target? With modern submarines, fire control equipment, high-speed torpedoes and torpedo spreads, I don't consider zigzagging affects the result. Your witness. The Prosecution has no questions for Captain Guardino, but, instead, proposes to call to the stand the only expert on submarine tactics who is relevant to the issue before this court, and that is Lieutenant Commander Mochitsura Hashimoto, Captain of the I-58, the submarine which fired at and sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis. [PEOPLE MUTTERING] [PEOPLE MUTTERING] [MAN SHUSHING] PROSECUTOR: Commander, what are your religious beliefs? I am a Shintoist. Do you know the meaning of falsehood and truth? I am fully aware of the distinction, yes. Do you know what perjury means? Yes. I'd urge that Commander Hashimoto be accepted as a reliable witness in this case, with a knowledge of the significance of testimony under oath. Before the Court gives its opinion on the reliability of this witness, I must, on behalf of Captain McVay and a very large body of public opinion, protest in the strongest terms the decision of the Judge Advocate's Office to introduce Commander Hashimoto. This man is the enemy, an enemy we have gone to the most extraordinary lengths to destroy, an enemy we despise and distrust. [PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] That he should be brought into this court to give testimony against an officer of the caliber and record of Captain McVay is a travesty and an outrage. CHAIRMAN: Silence. Silence, silence. Such demonstrations have no place in these hearings. Captain Lipscombe, the views you have expressed are not germane to the charges against Captain McVay. Not germane... You will confine yourself to procedure throughout the rest of these hearings. Questioning the witness will continue. Commander, what was the visibility on the night of your attack on the Indianapolis? In the direction of the moon, it was relatively good. At what distance did you sight your target? At about 10,000 meters. Was the target zigzagging? No. In your opinion, was the Indianapolis, in the prevailing visibility and following the course that it was at the time, was it an easy target? Yes, it was an easy target. I fired only three torpedoes and reserved my Kaitens. I had no doubt the attack would be successful. Would it have made any difference to you, on this attack, if the target had been zigzagging? It would have involved no change in the method of the firing of the torpedoes, but some change in maneuvering. CHAIRMAN: Captain McVay, please rise. Captain Henshaw will read the Court's findings into the record. The specification of the first charge in that the accused, Charles B. McVay, III, Captain, U.S. Navy, failed to order abandon-ship in proper time, not guilty. [PEOPLE MUTTERING] The specification of the second charge, that Captain McVay did hazard his command by failure to zigzag, guilty. [PEOPLE GROANING] This court is dismissed. Charlie, I'm sure you know there was nothing personal in this. I wish it could have come out the other way. Whatever the verdict, it was for the good of the service. It's not fair, Charlie. No, but it's over. Let's go home. REPORTER 1: Captain, what does your father have to say? REPORTER 2: Captain, over here. Over here, sir. Have you been in contact with any of the survivors? REPORTER 3: Excuse me, how about bringing the Jap in here? Captain McVay, have there been any discussions of your retiring? REPORTER 4: Are you staying in the Navy, sir? REPORTER 5: Hey, sir! Did you expect there to be a split... What do you think of the Navy bringing in Hashimoto to testify against you? REPORTER 6: Captain McVay, do you plan... Sir, do you plan an appeal? [REPORTERS CLAMORING] I couldn't sleep, either. Are you all right? It's all right. My love, it'll be all right. No. No, darling. It's not all right. They died. All those men. They died. Nobody said a word about them. They talked a lot about the coffin, but nothing about what was inside. You were used. Lipscombe told you they needed to be able to blame, and you were what they had. I was the Captain, Louise. No, Charlie, you were the scapegoat. They convicted you on a technicality. I will never forgive them for what they have done, bringing that man to testify against you. It wasn't his fault. Hashimoto had no choice. I know that. It has nothing to do with him. The Navy lost hundreds of ships during the war. No other captain was ever court-martialed. This has shown me the lengths to which they are willing to go to cover for their mistake. For God's sake, they left you in the water for five days. Come on. Louise. I need to talk to him, to Hashimoto. Why? I don't know why. But I know I need to talk to him. Captain, please sit down. I appreciate your taking the time to see me. I don't really know why I came here. You were not satisfied with my testimony. You told them what happened. Nothing more. The way you maneuvered your ship would have made no difference, if that's what's bothering you. You were in range. I fired. You completed your mission. I completed mine. Often, I have thought of the consequences of not stopping you on the way to your mission instead of on the return. But that was not to be. Captain. You are a man who believes in fate? No. I am a man who is trying to accept it. It's not easy to be a survivor. SCOTT: To Captain McVay. ALL: To Captain McVay. To our dear departed friends, the men of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.
