[instrumental music] [birds chirping] buzz slurp [snoring] tring Yogi, time to get up. Wake up, Yogi. Mother nature says rise and shine. Not to this bear, she doesn't. I like my naps long. Come on, Yogi. Spring is waiting. Full of fun and surprises. I guess I must have dozed off. (Boo Boo) 'You did, Yogi, three months ago.' Three months? Is that all? Can't a tired old bear get some sleep around here? Yogi, winter's over. You know what that means? 'Time to eat.' Did you say eat? Where's the popcorn? 'I mean, uh, what happened to our movie?' (Boo Boo) 'It's over too, Yogi. Just like winter.' Anyhow, who wants to stay inside when it's so beautiful outdoors? Just think, Yogi, all those new flowers to smell and fresh berries to pick. Mmm. Berries? Yuck! Not for this gourmet bear. If it's spring, it's time to greet and eat. I'm talkin' about tourists and all those pic-a-nic baskets. Yeah-hey-hey! 'Peanut better and jelly sandwiches' 'potato salad on pretzels' Bana cream pie on twinky dinkies. Hee-hee-hee. What do you think, Boo? I think I'm getting hungry, Yogi. Then what are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and get all those pic-a-nic baskets. splash Hey, Boo Boo, what does that look like to you? It looks like a picnic basket, Yogi. What a way to start the spring. Ah, let me guess now, fried chicken tuna fish sandwiches, salami on rye chocolate chip cookies. Hee hee hee. Yogi, let's just open the basket before it's winter again. You're absolutely right, little buddy. Without further ado, let's partake of a very bearable feast. [snoring] 'Hmm, three little yummy bears.' Three little bears? Oh, is this a joke? Gee, I mean, what am I seein' here? Three little bears, Yogi, abandoned. - I'm hungry. - I'm thirsty. I'm hungry and thirsty. What did you say about springtime surprises, Boob? It's not the kind I had in mind, Yogi. It's one of mother nature's dirty tricks. splat Sorry about that mother nature. I take it back. Here, read this, pwease. Uh, what's this? "Dear, Yogi. Please take care of these three little bears. '"Signed, Anomynous.' '"PS, uh, they like chocolate cakes' 'and chocolate chip cookies."' Gee, sounds like three chips off the old block. But, uh, who's this anomynous? I don't know, Yogi. Hi, cute little bears. Don't you have a mother somewheres? - Unh-unh, we're orphans. - Nobody wants us. Except you, pwease. Uh, let's not jump to any conclusions. I mean, uh, let's not go banas. - We don't like banas. - We want peanuts and popcorn. Please, we're hungry, Uncle Yogi. Uncle Yogi? Did you hear that Boo Boo? Loud and clear, Yogi. Last spring, I was a bachelor-type bear and now I'm an uncle? No way. Pwease. How do you say no to a sweet little fuzzy can of pwease? clank clank Oh, let's see. Uh, the pistachios are kaput. The sunflower seeds are sunk. No more macadamias. And someone woke up and ate all the peanuts. Hey-hey-hey. I wonder who that could have been? That leaves only one thing. The bottom of all bear foods. Nuts and berries, yuck! Hey, uh, acorns away. The cupboard is bare. And how many pounds did you gain this winter, Boo Boo buddy? Sorry, Yogi. I guess I had a snack attack. - We're hungry. - And thirsty. Pwease, feed the bears. Pwease. Oh, boy. I got a feelin' it's gonna be a long hungry spring. Until the park officially opens us bears are unofficially on our own. What's that mean, Yogi? It means if we wanna eat, we gotta use our feet. So follow me.

Are you sure there's fish in here? Of course, I'm sure. Fishin' comes naturally to us bears. That's why I'm smarter than the average fish. [laughs] splat [gags] Hey, Boob. What's that? That's the fish you're smarter than? Then after him I go. Ah-ho-ho-ho. splash Yay, yay. Go get 'em, Uncle Yogi. Let's see you hook that fish, Uncle Yogi. I love fwesh twout. Hey, I think I got a bite. Here, Boob. This is the catch of the day. It's just an old sign, Yogi. Uh, what does it say? It says "Beware. Attack fish on duty." Attack fish? Gee, I might get a bite after all. But that's not the average bite I had in mind. [cars honking] - Looks like a busy spring. - You bet. Everybody's getting an early start this year. Oh, boy. I can hardly wait to see all the animals. - Especially the bears. - You'll see them alright. Just keep an eye out for one big one in particular. You mean that pesty one in the funny hat and tie? Is he still here? You'll find out if he sees your picnic basket. Oh, no. He fooled me last year, but not this time. So long. Good idea, Yogi. This should help us get some food for those three little hungry bears. Yeah, yeah, we're hungry. - When are we gonna eat? - Pwease. (Yogi) 'Patience, little bears.' Uncle Yogi is about to show you there's more than one way to skin a pic-a-nic basket. [car honking] I thought that ranger said not to feed the bears. Dad, watch out! groan Wow, that was close. Mommy, what's wrong with that poor bear? Maybe he's weak from hunger. Uh, excuse me. But you took the starving words right off the tips of my lips. Hungry? He looks pretty fat to me. I beg your pardon but I prefer to be thought of as pleasingly plump. Everybody, stay calm. He may be harmless. Harm is indeed kind, sir. I'm a general creature of the woods that hasn't had a single nut or berry to eat all winter. As if I'd want any. I don't know if I'll make it through the spring. [sobs] How am I doin'? [cheering] Please, kind souls, could you spare a snack or two? [groans] I'm feeling a little faint myself. Here you'd better eat something quick. Was that quick enough? If not, I'll be happy to do it again and again and again. You never know what a bear that hungry might do. Uh, here, uh, you better eat this food. We just had breakfast. So long. - How did I do, Boo Boo? - Gosh, Yogi, I don't know. Uh, that wasn't honest, was it? What's honest gotta do with a starving bear's appetite? Mmm, yum, yum, yum, yum. Mm, boy, oh, boy, this is good stuff. Pass the jelly, pwease. (Yogi) 'You see what I mean, Boo?' You can't keep a hungry bear down. Especially these little ones. [telephone ringing] Alright, alright, I'm coming. (Ranger Smith) 'Happy spring, Jellystone Park. Ranger Smith speaking.' 'Hello, Mr. Commissioner' 'nice to hear from you so early in the year.' The park? Well, it just opened today, sir. Things are pretty quiet so far. Is Yogi behaving? 'Well, sir, to be honest, it's too soon to say.' After all, it's just the beginning of spring and if I know Yogi, he's sleeping in. He won't be bothering our picnickers for at least a few more days. 'Believe me, sir, you can bet on that.' 'You have some news about the park, sir?' 'Bad news?' Sir, that's, that's terrible. Can't anything be done? Well, of course, sir. I'll, I'll do my job, sir. Yes, whatever the park commission says. Uh, goodbye, sir. The park is over budget and has to close. It's not gonna be such a happy spring after all. But how an I gonna tell Yogi he has to move to a zoo? I know, I'll take Yogi the pie I just baked. That'll make it a little easier on the poor bear. Yogi, I should've known. Poor bear, my foot. - Yum, yum, yum. - Give me some more cookies. I wove cweam pie. Boo Boo, uh, those are the three hungriest little bears I've ever seen. And we're gonna have to feed them like this all spring? No way, Boob. We've gotta get those little bears adopted before they eat us out of cave and home. But, Yogi, we can't do that. - Can we? - It's them or us, Boob. If they stay, those little piranha-type bears will strip the forest clean. Hey, Uncle Yogi, where's dessert? Huh, huh? I want some ice cream now. With chocolate fudge, pwease. splat See what I mean, Boob. They gotta go right after dessert. Yeah, Yogi, I guess so. Hey, little bears, how about a nice fresh pie baked especially for you by my pal Ranger Smith? (Ranger Smith) 'Hold it!' Put 'em up. I've caught you red-handed this time, Yogi. You can't talk your way out of this one. Deny a pie in the sky? Me, sir? Never. I'm the guilty party and I admit it. By the way, what kind of a pie is it, Mr. Ranger Sir? It smells divine. Delicioso if I don't say so. It's blueberry. I made it from my own mother's recipe. Ah, she must be a sainted lady, sir. The Sarah Lee of Jellystone Park. Who else could have baked such a tantalizing mouthwatering and succulent dish of sweetness? 'Care for a slice, Mr. Ranger sir?' Why, thank you. Yogi, I don't mind if I do. Wait a minute. I'm not here for dessert. I'm here to deliver some news. Bad news to a bad news bear. Bad news, sir? Uh, you mean like no sun bathin' after dark? No swimmin' in our bear suits? [laughs] Bear suits. See, get it, Boob? Oh, yeah, Yogi. Bear suits. [laughs] I wish it were that funny, Yogi, but it's not. Jellystone Park is being closed. [laughs] Jellystone Park is being closed? [laughs] That's a good one, Mr. Ranger Sir. That's a.. What? Jellystone Park closed? I just got the word, Yogi, we're over budget 'and the park commissioner says we have to close down.' Mr. Ranger Sir, that cannot be. You're joking. Uh, please say you're joking, sir. It's no joke, Yogi. But, sir, if the park closes, that means no more tourists. And without tourists, there won't be anymore picnics. You're on the right track, little buddy. No pic-a-nics. No baskets. Please, sir us bon appetite-type bears cannot live on acorns alone. No, I can see that. Well, where you're going, you won't have to worry. Going, sir? You mean to a swank, rich-type hotel like the, uh, Ritz maybe? That's right, Yogi. The Ritz Zoo. The zoo? Oh, no. Y-you cannot do this. Please, sir. Now, Yogi, relax, it won't be that bad. You'll have your own air-conditioned cave and who knows, maybe room service and a cute little bear maid or two. Please, Mr. Ranger Sir. Don't send us away. These woods, they're our roots. Uh, don't tear 'em up, sir. Jellystone is our home. Yogi, get up. You're making a fool of yourself. I can't help it, Mr. Ranger Sir. We're just poor forest creatures with no place to go. If you send us bears to the zoo there will be no more hey-hey-heys or ho-ho-hos or who-who-whos. (Yogi) Oh, oh, please, Mr. Ranger Sir. Don't tear up our roots. Yogi, if you don't stop with oh-hos I'm going to tear out my hair. Sorry, Mr. Ranger Sir. I didn't mean to upset you. But what about these little cubby bears, sir? Surely, you wouldn't wanna make orphans out of 'em. Say, who are they anyhow? They're, uh, they, uh, well-- Uh, they're my cousins, sir. Uh, we've taken them in for the spring. Yeah, Boo Boo's distant relatives. We've given them a home. Aren't they.. splat '...cute, sir?' Adorable. I'm giving them a home too. The park bus will pick you all up tomorrow morning to take you to the zoo. Goodbye. Did you hear what he said, Boo Boo? Yes, Yogi. He said goodbye. Say goodbye to Jellystone? Hello to the zoo? We can't let it happen, Boo Boo. But what are we gonna do? I don't know, but I'm not gonna take this lyin' down. Uh, does that mean you're not going to go back to sleep, Yogi? You can count on it, little buddy. When our chips are down, Yogi goes to town. 'I'll be back in a jiffy with somethin' spiffy.' Uncle Boo Boo, do we really have to leave the park, huh, huh? We don't wanna go to the doo. We thought Uncle Yogi would take care of us. Don't worry, little bears Yogi will take care of everything. If he ever shows up. screech - What was that? - Uh, I don't know. Uh, but it sounds like Yogi. Yogi, where did you go? The park bus will be here in 20 minutes to take us to the zoo. You can forget the zoo, Boo Boo. I've assembled a little plan called the supercar escape. Ooh, what are you talkin' about, Yogi? Follow me and you'll see. Boo Boo, you are now sitting in Yogi's wild berry forest-fueled, turbo-charged supercar. Now you see, Boo Boo, our little fishing expedition wasn't such a foot flop after all. Gee, Yogi, this looks like the work of a genius. Just a little mechanical genius, Boo. Yeah, but does it run, huh, huh? We wanna go for a ride. Pwease, before the zoo bus comes. Hold on to your bear claws. The supercar is about to start and depart. First, a dash of super fuel. - What's that, Yogi? - It's my secret formula. Uh, all those nuts and berries are good for somethin', Boob. [engine revving] Yogi's cave is straight ahead. As soon as you pick them up, head straight for the zoo and watch out for any of Yogi's tricks. Yes, sir, Ranger Smith. I can't imagine Yogi not making a fuss but maybe he's mellowing in his old age. vroom - Hello, Ranger Smith. - Hello, Yogi. - Goodbye, Ranger Sir. - So long, Boo Boo. Yogi! Boo Boo! I should've known. Come back here. You're due at the zoo. Sorry, Mr. Ranger Sir. We prefer the wide open spaces to those kind of places. Not if I have anything to say about it. crash You won't get away from me, Yogi. Boy, oh, boy, Yogi, this supercar sure goes fast. This is nothin', Boo. You ought to see what happens when I step on the gas. The ranger isn't gonna like this, Yogi. This is Ranger Smith, Yogi. I'm ordering you, pull over. Hey, Boob, does that sound like Ranger Smith to you? Most definitely, Yogi. It even looks like him too. Then we better put the pedal to the metal 'and say arrivederci, Mr. Ranger Sir.' (all) Yippie. Yay! Yay! cough cough How about a little zigzag action? The Ranger's still there. - 'Ziggidy-zigger.' - 'And zaggin' too.' And if, uh, that doesn't work, we'll try a tunnel escape. [all screaming] chug chug chug Whoa! I'm supposed to be chasing them. Okay guys, time for a little mountain climbin'. And now for a twisted getaway. [all screaming] (Yogi) Hey-hey-hey, watch out below. - Hey, where's Yogi? - I'm right behind you. How do you drive this crazy thing? Huh? Huh? [all screaming] Like this. And away we go, go, go. And here I come, come, come. What's the ranger got in that heap of a jeep, Boob? A Maserati and a heart of Mustangs? I don't know, Yogi but we better think of something fast. He's gaining on us. It's no use, Yogi. Ranger Smith always gets his bear. Not this bear. Hang on, guys. We're goin' for a hairpin spin. I love hairpins. Yogi, we're sinking. No need to abandon ship. We're prepared for all emergencies. I call this snorkel underdrive. Hey-hey-hey. [coughs] I'll get you yet. (bear #1) Wow, wow, that was some drivin', Yogi. Yeah, top speed stuff. I need a towel pwease. I don't see the ranger. I guess he's had enough. That's because the supercar has all the right stuff. 'Look at this. A fork in the road.' (Boo Boo) 'Which way are we gonna go, Yogi?' The obvious way, Boo. 'The one that my tummy tells me to follow.' chomp Mm, that was yummy in my tummy. Just like old times, eh, Boob? Hey-hey-hey. What about the ranger, Yogi? You don't think he forgot us, do you? Not Ranger Smith, little bear buddy. We could use a place to hide. Like, uh, how's about this treehouse here? Us furry fugitives could use a little break in the action. So why not catch a few z's in the top of these trees? I'm afraid of high places. Yeah, us bears like to use stairs. Help us up, Uncle Yogi. Pwease, pretty pwease. Sheesh, I knew I should've slept in this spring. Next time I find a basket on my doorstep I'm steppin' back indoors. What are you doin', Yogi? These little bears insist on a lift. So just stay tuned for the old rope and basket ship. Yogi's elevator at your service. - Everybody, ready? - Take her up, Yogi. (both) Top floor. Pwease. Alright, heave. (all) Ho! - Heave. - Ho! - Heave. - Ho! Uh, heave! (all) Ho! Heave! (all) 'Ho!' 'Way to go, Yogi.' Come on up, Yogi. We've got a treehouse with a view. [laughs] A treehouse with a view. You must be kiddin', sheesh! 'Hey-hey-hey, this is my kind of place.' All that heavin' and hoin' made me hungry. I've heard of fast foods, but that was ridiculous. I'm fully, full, full. My tummy's tired. I'm sweepy. I feel like a little nappy-poo too. Boo Boo, hold all my calls until next fall. It's a little too bright. I'll use one of these masks to keep out the light. But, Yogi, uh, shouldn't one of us stay awake and keep an eye out for Ranger Smith? [snoring] I guess that answers that. How about one of you little bears? [snoring] Well, I guess that leaves me. If I sit down, I'll be able to stay up in case somebody comes. crash [snoring] Watch out, bully beaters. Look out, monster android. Attack, Bike Brigade. Last one to the clubhouse is a rotten rider. [snoring] This is it, guys. The secret hideout of the Bike Brigade. - Who are they? - They're us, nutso, rember? Now come on, follow our leader. So what's the big plan, big leader? To rid the world of bad guys and all unearthly intruders. (boy #1) 'Oh, yeah? Well, how are we gonna do that?' Frist, we have to find one. And when we do, we're gonna give 'em the works. 'The big zapper.' Yeah, but how do we know what an unearthly intruder looks like? They can look like anything. They could look like humans. Like you or me. Or they could look like animals like a cat or a dog or even a bear. (boy #2) 'So zap first and ask questions later.' [teeth chattering] Okay, but first, I'm gonna have a cookie. Hey, who ate all the cookie? They're all gone. It could only mean one thing. An unearthly intruder has been here right in our own clubhouse. - We've gotta find him. - And disintegrate him. [yawns] Not before you get the cookies back. I'm gonna take a nap. Shh. [teeth chattering] (Boo Boo) Whoa! - Look, we caught one. - Hold it, I'll blast it. Yogi, help! Okay, guys, you can knock it off now. You all know there's no such thing as evil invaders or.. [grunting] ...unearthly intruders! Help! Yeah, a big, fat, hairy one. There. Got ya! Oops. What? Not me! Them! - Hey, what? - I feel like a wet head. - Where's the leak? - What's all the noise? This place has been turned into a regular racket club. Yogi, something tells me we're in the wrong place. Somethin' tells me you're right. - Evil invaders. - Unearthly intruders. Blast 'em. [coughs] What a monster. Yike, he's a triple fat one. - I resent that. - Come on, Yogi. - Let's run for it! - You mean dive. I say slide. [all screaming] I'm right behind you. - Duck, you guys. - Look out. Every bear for himself. Look out below. Yes, indeed, folks, it happened right here in our town. And these were the young men who saw it. Tell us, kids, what was it you saw? There was a gang of 'em. Real weird-lookin. - Yeah, just like ET. - Especially the big fat one. Yup, that's Yogi alright. What else did you see? There was a small one hiding under the table. - And three little monsters. - That ate all the cookies. That sounds like those three little cubs. According to eyewitnesses, then intruders were seen to escape in a weird vehicle leading to the conclusion they are creatures from space. Creatures from space, my foot. It's Yogi, that's who. I'd better call the park commissioner. See, a big fat one. That's a distortion of the bear facts, ain't it, Boo? Don't worry, Yogi. You know how the news is today. - Any poop for a scoop. - I hear you, little buddy. Right now, that's all we have, folks. But as soon as we learn the whereabouts of these hairy aliens 'your on-the-scene reporter will inform you immediately.' Ah, ah, ahchoo! Oops, that's immediate enough for me. Let's blow! [engine starts] Hold it. Hold everything. What's that? It's a crazy car. It's a train. It's, it's.. It's, it's, it's.. (all) The cookie snatchers from space. Remember you saw it right here. vroom Hey-hey-hey, that's what I call real news coverage, eh, Boo? You got it, Yogi. Where to now, Space Captain Yogi? Yeah, where's us cookie monsters goin'? I don't wanna be a monster. Then just keep an eye toward the sky 'cause it's Yogi on the fly. Hey-hey-hey. And away we go-oh-oh! Yes, sir, Mr. Commissioner. I saw the news. [indistinct shouting] No, sir, it's not very good publicity for the park. [indistinct shouting] Yes, sir, I agree. We've got to get Yogi back right away before we can close down the-- [indistinct shouting] (Ranger Smith) 'You've sent the world's best tracker and his hound?' Well, yes, I could use the help. Uh, thank you, sir. Goodbye. I guess the commissioner doesn't think I can do the job myself. Well, I'll have Yogi back here before you can say.. [coughing] It's-it's smothering tornadoes. cough cough Who, who are, are you? [laughs] I'm Trapper the scrapper. A go-get-'em-and-find-'em kinda guy. Put it there. Put it there. Yiaow! [laughs] That's my callin' card. Little joke, little joke. [laughs] (Scrapper) 'And this here's Yapper.' 'And he's got a sniff mountain kind of a snout.' Shake, boy, shake. Yiaow! [laughs] Little joke, little joke. Now there, where's this Yogi bear? That's what the commissioner wants to know. And it's our job to find out fast. A rush job, eh? Okey-dokey. First things first. Like which way.. [blows] ...is the wind blowing? 'Cause that's the way we're gonna be going. As soon as old Yapper picks up the scent 'we'll know which way that Yogi Bear went.' [chuckles] Yeehaw! - Right, Yapper? - Yeehaw yup! And it looks like he went that way. Come on, Yapper, after that bear. - Yeehaw! - Yeehaw yup! (Scrapper) 'Come on, Yapper, this way. Yee-haw!' Yeehaw yup yup! splash (Scrapper) 'Yee-haw!' Something tells me it's gonna be a long spring. The last news bulletin put Yogi 30 mile straight ahead. Then let's make tracks. We'll bear down on that Yogi Bear. Right, Yapper? He he he. [laughs] Quit your yapping. Yap yap, he he, yap yap. ♪ Life is just a bowl of popcorns ♪ ♪ All buttery and sweet ♪ ♪ Like candy sticking to our teeth ♪ ♪ And peanuts here and there ♪ ♪ And twouble in here ♪ Look at that. (Boo Boo) 'Uh-oh, Yogi, trouble is right.' Trouble is my middle name. screech And speedy go is a high game. Hey-hey-hey. - Hey, wait a minute. - Come back. Come on, Bike Brigade, we gotta catch 'em. - Here they come, Yogi. - And away we go. vroom Hey, stop, we just wanna talk. I've heard that one before. 'You little bear, tie down your hair.' - Hey, we're flying. - Over the moon. Oh, I don't like to fly. vroom How we doing, Boo? Did we lose those rough and tough tykes on their bikes? They're right behind us, Yogi, and coming up fast. Hey, stop, will you? [panting] I'm running out of gas. Pull over. whirr Ooh, that was close. Yeah, t-too close. Something's knocking. I think it's my knees. No need to worry. I know my way through these trees. Yiaow! screech thud Where'd they go? One minute they were here. And the next minute, they're gone. Does that answer your question? - It's them. - We surrender. You've got us over a barrel. Of apples, that is. Hey, we just wanted to catch you. That's oblivious. To tell you, we were sorry. We didn't know it was you under that mask. The one and only Yogi Bear. You are the greatest. - And we're here to help you. - The greatest. Yeah, that has a nice ring-a-ding ring. pop pop pop And so does that. Then after we found the three little stray bears we got the bad news. The gates to our home, old Jellystone were about this swing shut. They were gonna send us to the zoo. (Yogi) 'Along with these cute little cubby bears.' We didn't wanna go to the zoo. Uncle Yogi saved us. Yeah, we made a supercar escape. Wow, Yogi, that's super alright. Super duper. Yeah, super super duper duper. We wove Uncle Yogi. He is our hewo. [chuckles] Well, I kinda wove you too. If you know what I mean. Hey-hey-hey. Listen, Yogi, don't worry about a thing. We're not gonna let him take you back to the zoo. No way. - You mean you have a plan? - We sure do. (boy #1) 'First, we're gonna get the size of your shoe.' - Okay, uh, what's next? - Watch this Yogi. whirr (boy #3) 'Now we cut out the shape.' Then nail it down.. tap tap tap '...for Yogi's escape.' boing boing Hey-hey-hey, I got you now and how. Well, what do you think, Yogi? I think it's a foot in the wrong direction if you catch my drift. And before the ranger does I think we'll make some tracks of our own. Hey-hey-hey. - Good luck, Yogi. - We'll keep them guessin'. (boy #1) 'Yeah, as long as we can.' [engine starts] whirr There is one thing a smarter-than-the-average bear never leaves home without. Can anybody tell me what I'm talking about? A big jar of honey made by the bees? St-rike one. Next answer, please. A lucky charm like a grizzly bear claw? Strike two. I'll pretend I didn't knew what I saw. A big fluffy pillow for when we get sweepy. Sorry, little Bitsy. That's strike three. And you're out. Now, Boo Boo, if you don't mind. The big basket, please. And I'll show how us bears stay safe in the trees. Coming right up, Yogi. For openers, one large bed sheet for Buzzy and Bopper to tie in the trees. And two cans of paint and plenty of brushes. 'And with a snook of the paw and a flip of the wrist' we'll paint a picture that the ranger can never resist, Hey-hey-hey. You say that bear went this way? It was seen near a treehouse. Maybe we can pick up his trail. [chuckles] Leave it to Yapper. He will sniff 'em out, right, boy? [chuckles] Yap yap. Now you know what a tree is, right? Yap yap. And you know what a house is, don't you? Yap yap. Okay, now you put them together and you got a treehouse, get it? Yap.. What? Uh-oh. Then forget it. screech I don't see a single clue. No way, no how. [sniffs] Not now, not now. I know there's a bear somewhere. Hmm, hmm. My mountain instincts are telling me something is up. I knew it, a treehouse. Not now, not now. Fixing to go up and have a look. - Ready, Yapper? - Yap yap. And up, up.. grunt ...and away. 'Up, up..' ...and away. And up, up.. '...and away.' 'And up, up..' snap [screams] '...and away!' thud Uh, I guess that plan fell apart. Look here, bear tracks. Big fat bear tracks. Those are Yogi's. Then what are we waiting for? Let's get tracking bear. With Yapper on the sniff, that bear's gonna be mine. All mine, right, boy? And once my hound has his nose through the ground there ain't, ain't a horse in a barn or a pig in a poke or a needle in a haystack that he can't nose out. Come rain or shine or sink or swim or.. blub blub [indistinct] ...I ought to have my head examined. Hey, it looks like it worked. Yeah, he fell for it. Yogi's gang is gonna make a clean getaway. (all) Uh-oh. [sniffing] If I was that bear, I'd throw my paws in the air and surrender. [sniffing] 'Cause my hound here is gonna stick to his rear. 'Cause he's got a nose that knows. 'eyes like an eagle and ears--' Alright, alright, I believe you. Looky there. A fresh set of tracks. - Follow that nose. - Yap, yap. (Trapper) 'Because this time we're gonna keep a close eye on them.' - I don't see any tracks. - Don't let that fool you. I've seen all sorts of critter tac-tricks but I ain't gonna fall for 'em, not this time. No way, no how. (Yapper) 'Yap, yap.' You know what my mountain instinct's telling me? I'm not sure I wanna know. It's telling me we lost trail. Okay, bear buddies, now that we've left some tracks it's time for plan B. So let's tuck out of here and see what we can see. whirr [panting] Yap yap. [chuckles] That's doing it, Yapper boy. We got us some skid marks. 'I wonder what they're doing in these neck of the woods.' These are Yogi's supercar skid marks. He's around here somewhere. Come on. That's what I was about to tell you. Somewhere there's a bear. Just leave it to me. I'll find Yogi. Or my name isn't Ranger Smith. 'See what I mean. Yogi's headed for the hills.' But he's not gonna fool me twice. crash I should've known. This is Yogi's artwork. [train horn blaring] (Yogi) So long, Mr. Ranger Sir. I hope you like a slow train to China. Hey-hey-hey. I don't think the ranger's gonna like it, Yogi. What do you mean, Boo? What's not to like about a free ride? Hee-hee-hee. Hey, Yogi, you really fooled him this time. You mean, we fooled him. My guys couldn't have done it without your guys. - Right, guys? - Yeah, we fooled them. - That's right, alright. - I wove twicks. The ranger doesn't like tricks, Yogi. Which means it's time to hit the highway my way. - Good luck, Yogi. - We'll be rooting for ya. Yeah and passing the word along. (all) Yeah, alright, bye-bye. So long, good buddies. You're the best. And like the man said, go West, young bears, go West. 'Hey-hey-hey.' (boy #2) 'Listen up, all you good buddies, everywhere.' We've got a big SOS for our pal Yogi Bear. [boy #2 on radio] 'No matter where you are, everybody, stay awake.' ''Cause Yogi's on the fly in his supercar ski.' - Alright, you got it. - The Swamp Foxes hear you. [boy #2 on radio] 'Yogi's bunch are dodging the suit.' 'So keeping them safe is up to us and you.' We get ya. They won't round up Yogi. No way, the Lone Raiders won't let that happen. [boy #2 on radio] 'Keep your ears tuned and your eyes open.' 'Yogi might show up in Texas or even Hoboken.' (boy #4) 'Hoboken? Hey, that's us, The Hawks.' Yeah, we better get out on the roof. (boy #5) 'And keep our eyes open.' Okay Hawkee, keep those peepers peeping. (boy #4) 'Right, we don't wanna miss Yogi.' (boy #5) 'They could show up anywheres anytime.' We gotta stick together. Do what we have to do. We can't let them take Yogi's bunch back to the zoo. - You said it. - Way to go, big leader. Keep sending. Hey-hey, Boo Boo, how about this for our new home? You mean where the buffalo roam, Yogi? I don't see any buffalo. That's because they are distinctly extinct. We wanna see cowboys. Yeah, yeah. And Indians, pwease. Would you, uh, settle for an old Indian trick or two? What are you doing, Yogi? I'm listening for any sign of the old rangeroo. [rumbling] What's this? Sounds like something big coming this way. [trotting] [coughs] Yogi, I thought you said the buffalo were extinct. Something tells me I was wrong, Boo in more ways than one, gee. (Yogi) '"Ghost Gulch." Uh, looks emptily.' 'Not to mention hollow, eh, Boo?' If you mean deserted, Yogi, I guess so. Are they real ghost, huh? No, there's no ghosts. I'm scared of ghosts. Don't worry, Boo Boo will put the boo into any ghost around here. In the meantime, I'll just mosey on in and see if anybody's home. Hey-hey-hey, anybody here today? I guess not. Oh, what's this? A stack of hats on a house, ho-ho-ho. Ah, ahchoo! Hey, bear buddies, look what Uncle Yogi has. What are you carrying, Yogi? Not enough insurance, that's for sure. Hey-hey. Hey, we've got hats. Yeah, we are cowboys now. Cowgirls too. Now that we've got our Western chapeaus let's see where the rest of this town goes. Hey-hey-hey. Look, there's an Indian. (bear #2) 'Yeah, right next to a picture of Uncle Yogi.' (bear #1) 'And Uncle Boo Boo.' (Boo Boo) 'Hey, they look just like us, Yogi?' And it says "Wanted for cattle rustling." Not me, Boob, I'm more of a chicken herder. 'But I got to admit those faces look familiar.' (Quick Draw) You mean, like the ones you've got on? I finally caught up with you, Bandit Bear and Li'l Brother Bear. It's a for-real cowboy. It looks more like a for-real cow-horse. Cow-horse? Oh, I've never been called that before. Hey, Quick Draw, what brings you to this neck of the woods? Or should I say range? You and your hole-in-the-floor gang that's what brung me, Bandit Bear. Bandit Bear? Quick draw, old buddy. How could you forget a face? It's me, Yogi. Don't old buddy me, you horse-stealing cattle-rustling, no-good galoots. I never forget a face. And don't you forget it. I'mma taking you in. Got it? Oh, I get it, but I don't think I want it. whirr You better save that rope for those bandit-type bears. 'Cause Yogi's making another supercar escape. vroom Hold it right there. There's no escaping. The long arm of the law. Hey, what happened to the sheriff? He looks like a pancake. Quick Draw, old pal, oh, I didn't mean to squash your day. That horse eye of yours just got in the way. Please, old horse, talk to me. I ain't got much time left. It looks like I am heading for a horseshoe heaven. No way, you're gonna be around for a long time old pony pal of mine. Are you sure about that? As sure as the fur on my chinny chin chin. Will you be willing to shake on it? Anything you say. Just don't kick the bucket on me. Anything you say 'cause this time I got you and you're not getting away. You got that, Bandit Bear? I got it, I got it. Shee, what a pal. With Bandit Bear in my calaboose I can throw away the key 'and Ghost Gulch can open up again.' 'Yes, siree, yes, siree.' - What's he mean, Yogi? - I don't know, Boo. This sounds like a bunch of horsefeathers to me. Callin' Lone Raiders. Lone Raiders, come in. - This is Scout calling. - This is Red Raider 1. What do you have up there, Scout? (Scout) 'I've got Yogi Bear and he is in trouble.' You raiders better get here on the double. I'm at Ghost Gulch with a hilltop view. We're on our way. Keep an eye on Yogi. 'Cause the Lone Raiders are gonna save the day. (both) Yee-haw. Yipi-ka-yee-ooh. (Bandit Bear) Hey, buzzard face. These are Bandit Bear lands you're trespassing on. So if you wanna keep your feathers in one flock buzz off. squawk [laughs] Did you see that, Li'l Brother? I saw that, big bandit brother. You scared that bird right out of its tree. That's 'cause there ain't no one meaner than my little brother and me. [laughs] Hold it, Li'l Brother. I hear somethin' coming. whirr Looks like company, big bandit. Yup, I reckon we'll have to give them a little surprise party. Ha ha ha. Yep, I can smell him. I can track him. - 'I can sniff him.' - But can you find them? Yay, yap yap. I never miss, not with this old Indian trick. Uh, I hear something coming right now. 'Sounds like there's two of 'em.' - Of course, there is, it's us. - Yap yap. Well, how do you expect me to hear with you two moving around, right, Yapper? [yapping] Now quit that yappin'. [yapping] Oh, here's something. Getting closer. Coming our way. vroom (Scrapper) 'It were a Jeep. I, I'd stake my life on it.' - How do you know? - 'Cause it ran over me. [gags] Does that tell? Hey, that was my Jeep. [yapping] Hey, Li'l Brother, this is gonna be the day. And what day is it, big bandit brother? Rob The Bank Day. That's what. [both laughing] (Quick Draw) 'Like I was sayin' with Bandit Bear' and his hole-in-the-floor gang locked up tight in my calaboose Ghosh Gulch won't be a ghost town anymore. You got the wrong bunch, Sheriff McGraw. Do us innocent bears look like any bandits you ever saw? Exact-ical-ly, now hold the palaver. It's high noon around these parts. 'That means time to put on the old feedbag.' First, I'll have a crunchy sagebrush salad 'followed by my favori-la-te' a bowl of mouth-waterin' cactus stew with a side of French-fried rawhide. And last but not least 'a tasty tuffer uffer' old mother McGraw's very own tumbleweed pie. Simmerin' sassafras. My lunch is up and rode away. blub blub blub Hold it right there. 'Drop those straws and raise your paws.' Mm, yum yum. - That was good. - I wove tumbleweed pie. My tumbleweed pie. 'From now on, for you bears, it's bread and butter.' Excuse me, sheriff, but don't you mean bread and water? Hey-hey-hey. [all laughing] I said what I mean and I mean what I say. And what I means to say is forget it. [gunshots] What did I tell you, Li'l Brother? It's Rob The Bank Day and nobody inside. Not even that horseshoe sheriff. He's probably hiding in the pond with his blinkers on. [both laughing] [humming] Howdy, Bandit Bear? Howdy, Li'l Brother Bear? - Did he say howdy? - That's what he said. [chuckles] Sometimes, you see the strangest galdern sights. If I didn't have them locked up in my calaboose 'I'd have thought I just saw Bandit Bear' and his little brother robbing the bank. Hold up there, Li'l Brother and Bandit Bear. In the name of the law, stay right where you are. This is downright discombobulating. Li'l Brother, we pulled it off without a hinge. Yeah, big bandit, we flattened the sheriff and now we's rich. [both laughing] Hey, it's Bandit Bear and Li'l Brother. And they just robbed the bank. That means Bandit Bear's on the loose and Yogi's in the calaboose. What are we gonna do? We're gonna deliver the goodies and the baddies too. I don't get it. The ranger is after Yogi, right? So instead, how about Yogi's look-alike? Then the ranger will have Bandit Bear and his little brother. And all we have to do is get Yogi and his bunch out. You got it, Scout. Calling Ranger Smith. Come in. Calling Ranger Smith. 'Calling Ranger Smith.' This is Ranger Smith. Listen up, Ranger, this could be your day. 'You got a Yogi Bear heading your way.' I knew it. I told you and I said so. Yogi Bear's heading our way. Right, Yapper? Right, yap yap. Yogi is heading my way and don't you two get in it. Don't you worry, Ranger. We're only gonna get in Yogi Bear's way. Roll that log over here, Yapper. [yapping] [chuckles] As soon as they stop for this here log 'they're gonna step in these here traps.' And you're gonna catch that dare bear or my name ain't T-R-A-P-E-R Trapper. Okay, okay, but you better hope this works. [engine revving] That sounds like him coming. (Trapper) 'Yep, that's him alright. You better duck, Yapper.' 'It's time to spring the thrill.' 'I said duck, not get stuck.' Looks like a log in the road, Li'l Brother. Looks like more than that, big bandit. See. I'll be right back, Li'l Brother. Soon as I trip this trap. Make it good, Big Bandit. That bear should've been here by now. [yapping] [grunts] This log is giving me a cramp. You mean this log? Yeah, that one. Now put it back before that Yogi Bear gets here. Bear? It's him. (Ranger Smith) Yogi, I'm ordering you to drop that log or you're gonna be in for it. No, you're gonna be in for it. The log, that is. Look at that, Li'l Brother. A logjam. [laughs] Looks more like a flying family tree. [laughs] (Ranger Smith) Oh, let me out of here.. (Trapper) Hey! thud [all grunting] splash [laughs] grunt [yapping] [laughing] - Well, it almost worked. - Now what are we gonna do? Get Yogi and his bunch out pronto. Yeah, we can take care of Bandit Bear later. You guys are right. Yogi's running out of time. So let's get him out before the ranger and his posse come back. (both) Yahoo! Yipi-kay-yeoo. whirr Yeehaw! Lone Raiders, here we go. We're gonna spring Yogi. (all) That's all we know. (Quick Draw) I don't know how you escaped my calaboose, Bandit Bear or how you snuck back in. But you ain't going nowheres until I give that bank money back. Bank money? Uh, what bank money is that, Quick Draw? The money you and your hole-in-the-floor gang 'rustled from the Ghost Gulch Bank.' 'That big barrel larceny' and it'll get you about 99 years. So don't make any plans 'unless it's working on the chain gang.' 'Choppin' wood on the wood pile' or putting your paws to the plough if you catch my drift. Yogi, it sounds like we're in trouble. That's for sure, Boob. Quick Draw has us mixed up with our bandit-type doubles. I don't wanna work on the ch-chain gang. Or ch-chop wood. Or put my p-paws to the plough. Pwease, Uncle Yogi, we're innocent. Don't worry, little bears there's no plough pushers in this bunch. I hope, I hope, I hope. (boy #6) 'Psst. Psst.' 'Hey, Yogi, over here.' Who's this? Our first visitor? I am a Lone Raider. We're here to break you out. After Scout pulls out the bars, we got the supercar waiting. What do you say, Yogi? I say it beats working on a chain gang. Boo Boo, what's the status on the sheriff? [snoring] It's siesta time. All clear. Then get ready, Yogi. Here we go, Scout. vroom crash Way to go, Scout. Now hurry up, Yogi. grunt - We gotta get you out. - I'm trying. It's a mighty tight squeeze. 'What I could use is some little bear help, please.' Okay, Yogi, stand by for a shove. grunt [all grunting] [screams] Hey, this is what I call a buckle seat. - All aboard. - Here we come, Yogi. Alright, Yogi, all systems ready to roll. Yeah. Let's hit the trail. Before the sheriff wakes up and puts you back in his calaboose. Hey, Lone Raiders, I appreciate what you've done but I can't leave my pal Quick Draw at the wrong end of a gun. What do you mean, Yogi? I've got to help Quick Draw get that money back. Yogi's right. And that means bringing in Bandit Bear and his little bandit brother. Then you'll count us in, Yogi. Yeah. The Lone Raiders are with you all the way. We'll help you get those bandit brothers. Or my name ain't Yogi. Hey-hey-hey. vroom vroom [chuckles] What do you say about all this gold, Li'l Brother? First stop, Acapulco. Yeah, Big Bandit. And how's about a South Seas Caribbean bear-type cruise? [laughing] vroom vroom There they are, Yogi. Dead ahead. I got him in my sight, Lone Raiders. Here we go! vroom Hey, Big Bandit, looks like we got company. Come on, you heap of a Jeep. Get it goin'. Okay, Yogi's posse, time to round 'em up. boing Yiaow! Attaway, Lone Raiders! One bear down. 'And one bad bear to go.' cluck cluck cluck vroom [crowing] cluck cluck cluck Hey, where did the egg noggin come from? [squealing] - There he goes! - He's getting away! oink oink Not for long. Ready, Bopper, huh, huh? Ready, Buzzy. Up away! whoosh [squealing] thud whirr whirr [screaming] splash Hey, egg head, don't forget your cwown. I guess seein' is believin'. Three little cops taking care of one big bad Bandit Bear. You know what they say, Uncle Boo Boo and Uncle Yogi? Uh, what's that, little guys? Yeah, what do they say? (all) All's well that ends well. Hey-hey-hey-hey! Shee. I think these little bears are stealin' my line. There's one Bandit Bear and his little bandit brother tucked safely into their cell. So it's time for me and my bunch to sayadios and fare thee well. 'Hey-hey-hey!' But what about the reward, Yogi? - Yeah, you earned it. - The money is all yours. This is one reward I don't have time to collect. 'So I'm donating it to the clubhouse' 'of the Lone Raiders!' (all) Wow, what a pal! Thanks, Yogi! Besides, uh, money ain't everything, you know? 'With those bear-type bandits locked up tight..' [both grunting] ...when my old pal Quick Draw wakes up from his nap the town of Ghost Gulch will be back on the map. Yeah, thanks to Yogi Bear. The people's pal! And the most unselfish-type bear we ever met. - You said it. Yeah, yeah. - He's the greatest. We love Uncle Yogi! Muah! That's, uh, mighty nice, but before we forget there's a ranger on our trail, so get ready and set to go, go, go with a yippee kayo! Adios, Lone Raiders! (all) So long! - Goodbye, Yogi! - Bye, Yogi! - Goodbye, Boo Boo! - So long! [engine rumbling] Hey, Yogi, uh, w-where are we n-now? I-I don't think I like this place. - It is dark. - And scawy. W-w-what do you mean? W-w-what's there to be afraid of? (all) Everything. M-maybe we should just stay here till it's light? Yeah, we can sleep while one of us stands guard. I'm too scared to sweep. Yogi, look. T-there's a sign. "Mumbo-Jumbo Marsh, beware!" Nobody tells Yogi the brave to beware. growl growl Then again, Yogi the chicken is willing to listen. [gasps] Hey, Uncle Yogi, look! (Bopper) 'It looks like a g-ghost ship.' (Bitsy) I'm afraid of g-ghosts. What do you say, Boo? Does that look like a ship of ghosts to you? I don't know, Yogi. It looks like pretty scary. (Yogi) 'Hey, we're not gonna let a little old steamboat' scarify us, are we? Besides, it looks like a pretty good hidin' place in case the ranger shows up. O-okay, Yogi. You're the boss. growl growl D-don't bosses go first, h-huh, huh? Yeah, brave bosses do. Especially when there is g-ghosts. You little bears just leave it to me. 'Cause Yogi Bear is smarter than the average ghost. Yikes! Anybody else wanna be boss? (Yogi) 'Are we almost there?' [grunts] Just a few more feet, Yogi. Yogi, where are you going? Didn't somebody say backward march? (Boo Boo) 'Yogi, watch out behind you!' Hey! Phew! That was a close one. You can say that again, Yogi. [howling] Did somebody say Boo Boo? Somebody said boo woo-o. - It sounds like.. - A g-ghost. A big scary ghost. Boo woo! [all screaming] Boo woo! Boo woo! I'm the ghost of Mojo and if you know what's good for you, you'll go, go. [all screaming] [all chattering] (all) Yikes! (Wally Gator) 'Well, I'd shake, rattle and roll' 'if it isn't Yogi Bear.' Do my bright eyes deceive me or is it my old pal Wally Gator? In the skin. Welcome to Wally's on the Bayou! You mean, you live here on this creepy, creaky houseboat? Hey, all us alligators don't live in the swamp. We're not savages. No way, no way. Then what's with the boo-woo on a bayou? If you don't mind my asking. Oh, you mean the poltergeist look? I certainly do-hoo. Just a little unfriendly persuasion to keep away the unfriendly. - But what the banjo, Wally? - And the piano. - Yeah, what about them? - They scared us. Just a couple of belling wire tricks I pulled out of the old alligator bag. 'In case, you know, one of those zookeepers' happens to show up. We got you, Wally. Us bears live in the same zoo-type booth. I know, I know. I've been hearing about you on the radio. But now that we're amongst friends how about some of Wally's home cooking? 'Well, like some, uh, chickery chicken' 'mud crab stew and dippy duck gumbo?' Mmm! Yes, sounds yummy. - I'm starving. - I want gumbo. Sounds like a swamp-type treat, Wally. Hey-hey-hey! That's it. I hate to admit it but for once, I'm filled to the gills. Oh, now I know what a stuffed turkey feels like. Hang in there, fellas, Chef Wally has just begun to cook. Now let's see. A pinch of [indistinct], a dash of oyster oil 'and a slug of our triple A hot sauce.' slurp toot No more, Wally. I can't eat another bite or my stomach will disown me. Oh, mine too, Yogi. Not us. We're still hungry! We want catfish and cookies now! And don't forget dessert. I love dessert. Jumpin' jambalaya. I've never seen three little bears eat so much. That's because you've never seen these little bears 'who by the way are in need of a swamp to stay' 'and since they appreciate your home cookin'-- Sorry, but this swamp is full up to the brim. You can get some cheap group rates the next swamp over just as soon as these little nibblers polish off the possum pie. clank clank Oh, no, I ate so much there's a ringing in my ears. I hope it's not the dinner bell. No way, no way. That's Wally's homemade alligator alarm. What's it mean? It means we've got dinner pests. Some swamp moochers who are about to have a ghost encounter for the first time! [laughing] If I told you once, I told you twice. I'm a sniffer and snapper and a tripper and trapper. And if this ain't that Yogi Bear's supercar my name ain't.. Okay, okay! I already know your name! What I wanna know now is where's Yogi? [Yapper yapping] Well, looks to me like Yogi Bigfoot went that way. - Right, Yapper? - Yap yap. (Ranger Smith) I mean, he-he's on that old haunted-looking steamboat? D-did you say haunted, like ghosts and goblins? [laughing] Everybody knows there's no such thing as ghost. - Right, Yapper? - Yap yap. So if you're afraid me and Yapper will just round up that Yogi Bear ourself. - Right, Yapper? - Yap. No way. Where Yogi Bear goes, this ranger follows. (Trapper) 'Well, then let's get it going, Mr. Ranger.' Oh, and if you see any ghost, just scream for old Trapper. [laughing] Yap yap yap. My intuition tells me that's the ranger I see. My alligator alarm is sending the same message. It looks like there is only one thing to do and that's make with the boo-hoo-hoo. Sounds swampy superb. Go to it, go to it. And while Yogi provides the ghostly shadows I'll man the special effects. roar roar Oh, that's scawy! And spice it up with a spooky rendition of Suwannee River. 'What do you think, Yogi?' I think it's time to man our battle stations. Hey-hey-hey! growl growl Yap yap! Sounds like there's a big cat on the prowl. We ain't afraid of no pussyfoot or pussycats. Come on, we got us a clear deck ahead. growl I hope the c-commissioner appreciates what I'm doing in the l-line of duty. I'll settle for a cash reward. Just me and 99 cents on the dollar. Yap yap yap! Okay, okay! 50-50. Now here's the plan. Ready, little bears? - Ready. One. - Two. Thwee! thud thud Ha! It just a little old cannonball. Nothin' to worry about. "Get lost." Says who? It sounds like something's burning. Yeah, like a short fuse. Whoa, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap! Not now, Yapper, I, I'm trying to listen. [Yapper yapping] Ah. I guess I didn't get me the message. Yap yap yap! - 'Boo-o!' - Uh-oh. We got us some uninvited laundry. Boo-o! I get the message just now! - Me too! - Yap yap! Boo-o! [all screaming] (Yogi) 'Boo-o!' Oh-ho, he-he sounds like a big one. [instrumental music] Boo-o! Boo-o! I don't know if I can bear to look. But I swear I've heard that ghost before. A boo-boo-bee do and yoo-hoo-pee do. I am the ghost of Mojo and if you're smart-- Knock it off, Yogi! The show is over. Yogi? I don't see a Yogi anywheres. Only the ghost of the bayou who's about to work his voodoo. A boo-hoo-pee do and a boo-hoo-pee do on you! Yogi, from now on you can work your voodoo in the zoo-hoo! Look! Hey, it's me, Yogi! You're our prisoner, you fugitive bear! Yap yap yap! Sorry, Yogi, but the chase is over. I guess so, sir. It looks like the end of the line. And the same goes for whoever is wearing that sheet! Who might that be, ranger sir? Why don't you ask him? He's right behind you. If you insist. [howling] It's no use, Wally. They got us cornered. Wally Gator? Oh, boy. That commissioner will give me a bonus for this. [howling] Forget it, old buddy. It's curtains. Hey, I forget it already. My string snapped a long time ago. [howling] Boo Boo, little bears, is that you in there? (Boo Boo) Unh-unh, Yogi, this is us over here. Yeah, here we are. - All present. - And accounted for. There's something gruesome going on, sir. I think you're right, Yogi. [howling] Knock off the noise, short sheet. Let's see who's under there. [gasps] There's nobody there. Now that's what I call out of sight. (Bitsy) 'It's the invisible man.' Ouch! Ow! Let go! Ow! Ooh! Who did that? There can only b-be one thing. [howling] A-a real-type ghost. Whoa! [howling] [all screaming] Help! Ah! It's a real ghost! - Aah! - Yap yap! [howling] I think it's time to send up an SOS. bang (Wally) 'Yeah, ASAP.' (Yogi) 'ASAP?' (Wally) That's Alligator short hand for "now." Uh-oh, h-here they come. [all screaming] [howling] I'm ducking out of here! Me too! [all screaming] [howling] Yap yap yap! creak snap [howling] [all screaming] It looks like we got us a dog paddle. And they're rolling on the river. [ghost howling] I'm not going any place with that ghost. Hey, Wally, uh, what are you doing? I'll take my chances in the muddy Mississippi. Are you coming? Oh, I can't leave without Boo Boo and those little bears, wherever they are. Here we are, Yogi. - We were hiding. - From that ghost. He's cweepy. Double creepy. So let's get out of here. Hold your noses and say a prayer that when we land, somebody's.. (all) There! Hey, that was a super-type rescue, Swamp Fox pals. Yeah, it was swell. Stupendous. I guess you can say our friends were actors. Y'all can always count on us 'cause any friends of Yogi is a friends of our. Best friend! Us Swamp Foxes think you all are the greatest and Yogi is the king of the bayou! The feeling is mutual from us bears large and small. Bon voyage, bayou buddies. Way to go. Hey-hey-hey! vroom Why are we stopping, Yogi? I hear the sounds of fun and merriment, Boo. Have a look. (Boo Boo) 'Wow, Yogi, it's a carnival!' Oh, boy, oh, boy! I wanna go on the Ferris wheel, huh, huh? I wanna see the fat lady sing. I want cotton candy, pwease! It looks like fun, Yogi. I guess that makes it unanimous. (Snagglepuss) 'Step right up, ladies and gentleman.' Just oneth in time, one tenth of a dollar for all you can see, and all you can holler. Thank you, thank you, and you're welcome. And now what you've all been waiting to see. Doing her famous dance of the pyramids [indistinct], and Malibus. Little Egypt. [indistinct murmuring] Have you ever seen such a vision? A plethora of pulchritude, a rare sight indeed. [all shouting] Heavens to Murgatroyd, Little Egypt is defective. 'Have patience. Try a little tenderness.' Little Egypt, the princess will be right.. Sufferin' sardines! How's a poor prissy cat to survive the loss of his top star? I've gotta put out an SOS for some excitement. A performer with pizzazz. Like a muscleman from Mars or any sort of minor miracle. Did somebody say miracle? 'Or would you believe a troop of' 'and get this' large and tiny dancing bears? I say ahoy there, Yogi old pal! Hey, Yogi, it's Snagglepuss. Snagg, you old carnival cat. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I could say the same thing. Hey, Yogi, who are your little claimin'-type friends. Yogi's more than our friend. Yeah, Yogi's our uncle. Our great uncle. How sweet. I'm ever so touched. Boy, oh, boy, am I ever and just at the right moment. Say, Yogi, how do you feel about showbiz? The stage, the stars, the lights! You mean the bright lights, Snagg. Uh-oh! Hey, Yogi, look. It's the ranger. I appreciate the offer, Snagg but what we really need is a place to hide our hides. As I was saying, my tent is your tent. So exit stage left. [elephant trumpeting] - Snagglepuss. - Mr. Ranger. Greetings and salutations. What brings you to the carnival? Yogi brings me. What else? Yogi? You mean smarter-than the-average-bear-type Yogi? I certainly do. Have you seen him? Not since the Jellystone Reunion and that was some picnic. Say you, what do have in this here tent? I take it you mean this tent here? Well, that's what I said, didn't I, Yapper? Yap yap yap! - So come on. What's inside? - My next act. And they're dressing for their performance. Did you hear that? Dressing for their performance. I heard that. Supposin' I take a look. Splendid. Suppose you do. 'It's only a dollar and it's the show of shows.' thud 'Just step around to the front.' Next act in five minutes. Hold it, Fido. This ain't a free lunch at the pound, you know. 'Thanks. You're all paid up.' Yap yap. Step right up, folks, step right up. There's no time like showtime. 'And this is one show you won't wanna miss.' So here it is for your eyes only. 'Straight from the Nile with a smile' Little Egypt! 'Correction, make that Big Fat Egypt' 'and her little dancing mummies!' [instrumental music] Man, oh, man. Look at that Big Egypt. Wooh! Ain't she something? Yeah, something fat and familiar. Hey, Yogi, how long do we have to keep this up? As long as the ranger is watching. Ooh, it's getting hot in here. And sticky. I don't like mummies. Man, would you look at them eyes, them lips? How about those big hips? There's something shaky here. You said it! Big Egypt, you make me shake, quake and quiver. Ooh, and I'm gonna give you a smooch that'll make you shiver! Mwah! Yuck! Shiver is right. Yogi! I knew it. Yogi, you hold it right there. Hit the curtains, Snagg. Gotcha, Yogi. And if you'll take this cat's advice-- I know, I know. Exit stage right! Yeehaw! After him! [Yapper yapping] Hurry it up. All bears, aboard! You can hide in here while I divert the ranger's attention. Alright, Snagglepuss, where are they? They, sir? Yeah, they! Yap yap! Quiet, Yapper, I am interrogating a witness. Now where's that Yogi, that big belly dancer and them other little imposters? Oh, you mean the ones impersonating the mummies. - They belong in a museum. - They belong in the zoo. Now which way did they go? Yap yap yap! That way! [yapping] (Snagglepuss) 'This is it. The skyway is the highway.' 'Good luck, Yogi!' vroom thud [laughs] [laughs] [laughs] [laughs] blub blub shriek squawk squawk [engine sputtering] rumble rumble crash roar boing creak (Boo Boo) 'Yogi, what was that?' (Yogi) 'I don't know, Boo, but I think it's time' to sound the all clear. Wow. Look at the fog. It's has thick as soup. The ranger will never see us in this stuff. So come on, let's not stick around. Hey, somebody forgot to tell me my feet ain't touching the ground! Hey, where are we, huh, huh? Search me. I can barely see in front of my bear nose. That's because we're in the alto nimbus cloud. Oh, what are we gonna do, Yogi? What can we do, Boo? Except take a alto nimbus nap and wait for things to clear. (Ranger Smith) 'Yogi, this is the ranger calling.' Hey, Boo, I could've swore I heard the ranger call my name. Me too, Yogi. We must have been dreaming. It's no dream, Boo. Take a look. (Boo) 'It's the Empire State Building.' (Yogi) 'I always wanted to see the sights' 'but not get stuck on them.' (Ranger Smith) 'This is the ranger, Yogi. Do you read?' I ready you, but I don't see you, sir. Yogi, look! Yogi, you can give up now! Up, sir? How far up you want us to be? Wow! We must be a 100 stories high. I feel like King Kong. I feel dizzy. Ladies, gentleman, this is truly unbelievable. It looks as if it's all come down or I should say up to this. The perilous trail of Yogi and the great bear escape has seemingly ended right here at Empire State Building. 'Where it has just been learned' 'that the president of the United States' 'is on the phone to Yogi himself.' Yogi, listen to me. I've got some news for you. Good news or bad news, sir? (Ranger Smith) 'It's your president, Yogi. He wants to talk to you.' The president wants to talk to me? What am I gonna say, Boo? Say hello, Mr. President. Hello, Mr. President. Uh, Yogi here. How do I like the Empire State Building? How about, uh, a little lower? Hey-hey-hey! Just joking, sir. What's that, sir? You're not gonna let Jellystone close? That's great news, sir. And we can all go home? Boo Boo, the little bears and me? Thank you, sir. You're one of the good ones, sir. Bye-bye, sir. Did you hear that, everybody? A reprieve from the president himself. We're no longer bears on the run. We can go home and hit the hay. And where else could that happen except in the good old US of A. [Yogi yawning] Boy, oh, boy, am I bushed? It's been a long spring, Boo. I think I'm gonna hit the old rock-a-roo. But, Yogi, i-it's too early. It's not even summer yet. It's never too early for a growing bear to get his sleep. I'm gonna turn in and call it a spring. (all) Surprise! It's the little bears, Boo and they're sleeping in my bed. Hey, hey, Uncle Yogi. I'm hungry. I wanna drink of water. I wanna hear a story pwease. Well, Boo, I guess bringing up three little bears is a never-ending job. Yeah, Yogi, I think you're right. Uncle Yogi, Uncle Boo Boo we have a secwet we wanna tell you. (Yogi) 'A secret? For us?' (all) Uh-huh! Okay, we're listening. We just wanted to say.. (all) We think you're the greatest! (Bitsy) We wove you. Mwah. Gee, Boo, I guess that's what you'd call a real bear hug. - And you know what? - What, Yogi? I love it, hey-hey-hey. [instrumental music]
