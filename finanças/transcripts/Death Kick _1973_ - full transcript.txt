Deng residence Open. Five, six, winner takes all. Mr. Gordon, I beat you again Hong Hua, you are in luck this year. I hope so. In luck... Winner takes all again. Godpa, I don't want to play anymore. Let's go up to watch the lion dance. You've won so much how could you stop playing, come. Mr. Gordon. You haven't seen our lion dance. I'll accompany you, you'll enjoy it. That's great, let's go. Come on. Great. Congratulations. Inside please. Teacher... the guys from the Mai martial arts school created trouble at our lion dance at West Gate. They beat us too. I'll take a look. Brothers, it's okay. Cousin, we are relatives and today is new year's day why should we fight? Liang Kuan injured my students. You indulge your students, what have you to say? Ah Kuan, how have I taught you? You dare disregard what I taught you. I... I will teach him a lesson I will pay for the treatment of your mens' injuries and also apologise to you. Not that easy. I am a man of repute and you can't just apologise and have done with it. Then what do you want me to do? I want you to prepare a roasted pig and gifts and come to my school and apologise in front of the public otherwise our relationship is going to be severed. Alright, then. Come with me. Continue the lion dance. You will know my power at the Lantern Festival. Bao Zhi Lin. You are like a bunch of hooligans causing trouble during the new year festivities. Did you assume knowing some kung fu entitles you to cause trouble? See? Now you are injured. Doubt if anyone would pity you! Teacher, your invisible kick is well known if you're willing to teach us... Shut up. I have not used it for over 10 years I'll not teach it to you. We are being bullied would that not reflect on Bao Zhi Lin? Ah So, teacher must have reasons for not teaching us. Teacher, tell us the reason at least. Please tell us, come on. What's there to tell? For the past 10 years I have forgotten this invisible kick. Ah Kuan, Su Nan. Come with me on the 15th to Mai's place to apologise. They caused trouble first why should we apologise? Ah Kuan, it's difficult for us to do. Right, is there any justice? If you don't get out of Bao Zhi Lin. Teacher has a strange temper why can't he be frank with us. I know what happened to our teacher. Tell us... But I haven't eaten yet. Don't worry, An Kuan will treat you. Damn you. That's easy then. Alright, I'll treat you, tell us. Come on. Have you noticed the photo in teacher's room? Yes. Do you know who that is in the photo? No. I have long forgotten the Invisible Kick. No, brother, I can't forget. I'll never forget. What's the big deal about the Invisible Kick! If you have guts, fight with me. Alright. Brother. Si Ji restaurant. We are full. Thanks to your treat, Ah Kuan. Don't thank him yet, something better is coming. What is it? Watching a show, he will treat us to a show. When did I agree to that? Look at you. You have to treat us. Look who's doing the show? Da Hong Hua, girl of your dreams. Damn you! Won't you give her support? Alright, let's go. Miss. Miss, look who's here. Who else but that old fox from West Gate and that foreigner. You'd never have expected that. Just look at yourself. Bravo... Miss Hong, move aside. Hurry. Damn, his leg is broken. Ask a bone setter here immediately. Where could I find one on new year's day? Miss, that good friend of yours isn't he the one? Right, get him immediately. You seem pre-occupied today. I wasn't concentrating and caused this. I can't fix his leg. Let Su Nan get our teacher here to take care of it. Hurry. Hong Hua, look... What an honour! Mr. Gordon has come to watch your show. You're too kind. This place is a real dive, not fit for honoured guests. Don't say that Gordon really appreciates your talent you must go for supper with him tonight. Be a good girl. I'll pick you up after the show. Master Huang, this way. Master Huang... Master Huang... Miss Da Hong Hua. I was careless on the stage and caused him injury. Please help. Sure. There, it's done; now let him rest. Thank you, how much would it be? Usually, I don't practise on New Year's Day. I'll take no payment. Thank you so much. Ah Lan, take master Huang to watch the show. Yes. I'll treat everyone to midnight supper after the show. Good. Thanks. The West Gate Fox. Li Tian Dao? When did you come? This afternoon. You're a hard man to catch. Your security being tight I had to wait for your return. Sorry... do come inside... You asked me to come all the way from the north what could I do for you? If there's no big business would I dare trouble you? If this deal pulls through you and I could retire. Tell me about it. As you know business of the foreigners in Guang Zhou is doing well. So I heard. Business is only their front; In fact they smuggle tobacco, thereby earning our money & harming the health of our people. I can't accept this and must put an end to this. Damn. What a true country hero! Old fox. When did you become a patriot? C'mon, stop pulling my leg. Speak up. That foreigner Gordon made lots of money through his tobacco trade and bought many pieces of jade ornaments. He's worried about the safety of putting the jade ornaments in his company and that's why he needs a security chief to protect his assets. So, you have asked me to come all the way to be his security chief, is that it? Yes, once you are the head the cash and treasures of the company will last you more than a lifetime. What do you say? Great idea, but the martial artists of Guang Zhou would also vie for this position what would happen if someone recognised me? You never leave traces nor let anyone alive who would recognise you? Don't worry. As long as I am here to support you you will secure the position. I think hard if there would be problems. Why is there such a bustle? Today is the Lantern Festival. Master Huang is here to apologise to Mai Gen. How are you, master Huang? Mai Martial Arts School. Let's go. Is Master Mai in? What do you want him for? We are here to apologise. Apologise? Without gifts? Have you ever seen such a thing? Sorry, although we haven't brought any gifts we are sincere nevertheless. Please let us see master Mai. Sorry, master Huang our main gate has broken down please go through this door. Let's go. Stop. Master Huang, what do you mean by not going in? Ah Kuan, go and apologise to master Mai. Master Mai, I seek your magnanimity. Is it called an apology? You have no sincerity. You wounded my students. I'll settle the score with you. Cousin, why bother with these kids. Alright, I'll fight with you then. Your iron claw kung fu is really as deadly as they say. I have tried it. Then you admit defeat, is it? Yes. Let's go. Master Mai, your kung fu is the best you will most likely be the head of security of the 13 companies. I don't believe that Mai fellow is so good that no one dares compete with him. His iron claw kung fu is famous throughout Guang Zhou. Just a strike from him will either cause serious internal injuries or even instant death. You think too highly of others and do injustice to yourself. Do you know how I built my fame? No. By this Deadly Ghost Spirit which no one can guard against. What is this technique? It's a secret that can't be leaked out. You'll be impressed when the time comes. Not only master Mai, but even I want to see for myself. Right, let's go. Let's go. Teacher. Well? Has Huang Fei Hong submitted his application? No. Today is the deadline what is he waiting for? I heard at Bao Zhi Lin that he doesn't want this job. Really? However, someone else has applied. Who? Li Tian Dao. Li Tian Dao? Never heard of him. Must be from elsewhere. Perhaps he isn't aware of my deadly claw. Folks, I am not boasting. That was Shaolin's Tiger claws it's real kung fu and not for show. If you don't believe me try it out. Come and try. No... You, come and try. No... All gone. Come and try, be bold. Come and try. Master Huang, so it's you. Everyone, don't go. They're all gone. Take it. Ah Kuan, Ah Nan, come and have some noodles. What would you like, master Huang? 3 bowls of noodles 3 bowls of noodles. You've to compete with Mai Gen the iron claw tomorrow. Your kung fu is great and you have my utmost respect. I'll pay for your noodles. Li Tian Dao, haven't seen you for a long time. What a coincidence meeting you here again! This is a place of civility and reason. Whoever attempts to do things by force will pay for it. Since you are here you must abide by these rules. Go. Cousin, you are drinking alone, how enjoyable. What are you doing here? You are fighting against Li Tian Dao tomorrow. I wonder if you would accept some advice from me. Thanks. With my kung fu I am confident I could win. Do you know who he is? Who cares! You have to. He is not as simple as you think. Who is he? When I was a coach for the marine we caught a robber called the Wandering Tiger. He was a real villain and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Later he escaped and committed many serious crimes up north. He is now in town and is your adversary tomorrow. So what? Would I fear him? It's better to be cautious. Bull shit. You are drunk. Come and see our guest out. Yes. As we are cousins I must advise you. It's difficult to guard against treachery. Contest for the Security Chief of 13 Companies. Master Huang, please sit. Thank you. Li Tian Dao. Teacher. Miss Hong is here. The competition now begins. Li Tian Dao hasn't arrived yet. I have sent someone to bring him here. Shun An Inn. Master Li... wake up.... The foreigner's here, the competition is ready to begin. Iron claw Mai Gen demonstrated his skills just now they are deadly indeed. With your Deadly Ghost Spirit he'll at least break 4 ribs. My respects. Let's go. The competition now begins. Honoured guests, these two are highly skilled masters but because they are competing they will exercise control and score points only. Please adhere to the rules. No way, I want them to fight for real victory. Understand? That might cost someone's life. The more exciting it will be. Alright, the competition starts now, Master Li Tian Dao. Master Mai Gen. Fight. We have a winner, stop them. No, I want them to have a real victory. Stop. Who are you? Huang Fei Hong. They volunteered for the competition and signed the death agreement. There's no winner yet, how could we stop. If someone dies, it'll be your responsibility. Fight... Arrest anyone who makes trouble here. Hear that? You'll be brought to the authorities and end up either going to jail or be shot. Li Tian Dao will be the security head. Careful. Yes. Let's go. Deadly Ghost Spirit is really deadly. Take off your clothes and let's have a look. Master Li. Teacher. Master Huang, catch up with him and kill him. Forget it, where's master Mai? He fainted from his injuries. Go and see. Master Huang is here. Broken a few ribs. Master Huang, please treat him. Bear it for a while. You're lucky you are strong but you'd need to rest for long time. I... Don't worry about it. From today you need to cut out on hot & sour foods as well as eggs and beef. Most importantly, you've to abstain from sex, most detrimental to your condition. You understand I am sure. Help him back to get some rest. I'll ask Ah Kuan to bring you the medicine when ready. Let's go. Cousin, thank you so much. Make way please... At last the position of security head is secured. I am worried that Huang Fei Hong and the four masters would expose my past. Huang Fei Hong is the most difficult of them all to deal with. Please think of a plan for me. Cui, didn't you say just now you saw Huang Fei Hong treating Mai Gen? Yes, he said the injury was serious and asked Liang Kuan to bring the medicine to his place. Really? Guang and Li, come here. Teacher, the medicine is ready. Excuse me. Take the medicine to master Mai right away. Ask him to have it while it's hot. I'll go and see him in the evening, understand? Yes. Ah Kuan, be careful. I know. What do you mean by this? Nothing. They want to fight. Let's go. What's the matter? Strange. Let's go. Make sure Master Mai takes the medicine while it's hot our teacher will come and see him tonight. Thank you. Su Nan, what are you bluffing this time? I am not bluffing. We were on our way to deliver the medicine when some guys wanted to cause us trouble. I showed them a thing or two and they ran away just like that. Your kung fu has improved. That's because teacher taught us well. But it's a bit strange. One of those two bastards was eating noodles with Li Tian Dao the other day. He looked like one of Fox's men. Who had the medicine when you fought? I did. You had it all the time? It wasn't convenient so I put it on a stone tablet. Teacher... Where's teacher Mai? Resting upstairs. Teacher. It's you. There was poison in the medicine. What do you have to say for yourself? What could he say? Teacher took his medicine and died. Grab him... Stop. I am an upright man and have nothing to hide. I'll never do such an evil thing. The truth will come out one day. Don't go. Upstairs... Stop him... Chase. Sorry to disturb you. You are master Huang. You know me? Of course. You cured my leg I am really grateful. No need, I've been framed and need to hide here for a while. Sure. Have you seen Huang Fei Hong? No. Let's go. What's your name please? I am Huang Kwai To, this is my wife. Madam, so we are both of the Huang family. Please send this letter to Bao Zhi Lin addressed to Ah Kuan my student. No problem. I have pen and paper upstairs, please follow me. You beast, the teacher isn't back yet and all're anxious, how could you eat at a time like this? I am so hungry I can't stand it. Big trouble... something happened to teacher. What is it? A letter from him. Let me see. Leave Bao Zhi Lin immediately. Let's go. Liang Kuan, Huang Fei Hong poisoned my teacher and you want to escape. Nonsense. If not, why are you fleeing? Surrender Huang Fei Hong or I'll level the place. A life for a life; however show me evidence first. Su Nan, let's go. Right. Careful. Where to? Go. Huang Fei Hong poisoned Mai Gen and has escaped you will take the heat for him. Take them away. Boss... how are you? Are you alright? Boss. What's up? Mai's men have killed all your students. Liang Kuan and Su Nan have been captured by Li Tian Dao to stand in your place. Alright, I'll speak... Go on. I suppose Teacher is no match for you in flattery. He might learn a thing or two from you. Ah Kuan, you'll save a few bucks today you said you want have a massage. This masseur is not bad. Let him go hungry a few days, that'll break him. Go. You're really smart, that's a great idea. Naturally. The authorities will blame. Mai Gen for the death of Huang's students. That's killing two birds with one stone. Mr. Gordon, let them go. Your kung fu is the best. Mr. Gordon, you have been scared. I'll throw a cocktail party for you tomorrow. Put that up there. Put this over there. You've done well. Take these and get a few girls and enjoy. Thank you, master Li. Sir, master Huang insists on seeing you. Great, please. Yes. Hide, I'll deal with him. Huang Fei Hong, I heard you put poison in Mai Gen's medicine. The authorities are looking for you everywhere. You've come in good time. Come with me to the authorities. I've come precisely because of this matter. The poison is your handiwork what cruel treachery. Bull shit, I have no quarrel with Mai Gen. Why should I kill him. But you... I heard that you had a quarrel on new year's day. That was due to the ignorance of my students whom I have already reprimanded. But you killed my students and captured Liang Kuan and Su Nan. What do you mean by this? Nonsense, careful what you say. Since you deny this could you let me search around. If they are not here then you are innocent. But if I find them you won't escape. Wait, you won't find anything here. Come, take him away. Get away. Don't move. Chase, hurry. Chase. Go and chase. Split up. Stop. Master Huang. Stop. Miss Hong. Have you seen Huang Fei Hong? Yes, he is nearby. Where? It seemed he went that way. Chase. Thank you for saving me. You are hurt, what to do? It doesn't matter. Right now you're off to find Deng Xi, isn't it? Is there anything I could do for you? My students Liang Kuan and Su Nan have been locked up by Deng Xi. Please get them out. Alright, I will do my best. After that please let them hide in your home. I'll contact you. But your wound... I am a doctor, I'll take care of myself. Miss Hong, thanks. Don't mention this to anyone, understand? Yes. Go. Fox, come here, I want to ask you something. You're not a good person. What do you mean? You promised that in 3 days you'll solicit Miss Da Hong Hua for me. You haven't done it, you lied. You old fox. So it's about this. I haven't lied, I'll do it. I'll reward you when it is done. Miss Hong Hua is here. She is here. Go to the back and check where Su Nan and Liang Kuan are kept. Godpa Hong Hua, why are you so late? I thought you weren't coming. Would I dare miss Mr. Gordon's party? Great, inside please. Please sit. What would you like to drink? I'll get it for you. So very kind of you. I am not like you Chinese. For us it's always ladies first. Then a glass of wine please, thank you. Good. Godpa, you are bad you always tease me with that foreigner. How could I do such a thing? You are my darling girl but that foreigner is very important to us. No matter what, see that you serve him well tonight; as a favour to me. No way. Miss Da Hong Hua. Let's have a toast. Cheers. May I have this dance? Sorry, I have to retire to the back. Why? You have just arrived. It's a ladies matter, why would you want to know. Oh, I see, go ahead. Sit. Wake up... come. There was someone. Where is it? Look over there, I'll look over there. Come. Can't stand still. Get up... I saw your teacher just now. He asked me to tell you he's gone out of town to hide for a while. He's asked you to try and contact him. Thanks. Let's move on quickly. My home is at Oi Kwan Road hide there, I'll return quickly. Alright, thanks. Eat your fill, we have lots of leftovers. I have no appetite but I could eat some more. Your injury is serious, go and lie down. No. That wouldn't be appropriate. What do you mean? We're friends. Besides, you helped me so I should repay you. Be good, lie down. Sister Lan, where should I sleep? I have made preparations for you. This is a comfortable bed. Acting gear! They're comfortable while I sleep on cold, hard surface. I'm changing, turn around and close your eyes. Close your eyes. Be good and don't move. I'll make you comfortable. Well? Comfortable? Yes, you're good. Oh, it's bleeding. Don't worry, it'll be okay in a while. Don't move, I'll get a towel. Why is it so tight? The tighter the better. It's too tight. This is my first time. Be patient, it'll loosen up in a moment. Oh, my dear brother. Don't forget what teacher said you have to be on a diet due to your injuries. Above all, abstain from sex. Don't play with your life. Teacher. Where's Ah Kuan? Inside. No. Why not? They... Master Huang. Miss Hong, you saved us all. I don't know how to repay you. It's my obligation. Ah Kuan, let's go. Where are you going this late? It's not convenient to disturb you. I have found a place to hide and let my wounds recover before we did anything else. Invisible Kick. Open... Whom do you want? Your master the Fox of West Gate we must see him about something important. Sorry, he has no time. Please go back. We'll wait here then. No, please leave. If not we'll have to use force. Let's see about that. Stop, what do you think you're doing? We are here to see master Huang. You must have the wrong place this is the Deng residence, not Bao Zhi Lin. Stop pretending. The night before last someone saw him here then he disappeared. You must have seized him. If you don't surrender him we'll search the place. Search. Stop, you want to cause trouble here. Fox, we haven't come to fight we only want master Huang. That's all we want. You are unreasonable. Huang Fei Hong is wanted by the authorities. If he came here I would have taken him to the authorities why keep him here? If you continue to cause trouble here I'll take you to the authorities. Old Fox, don't pretend. Master Mai Gen's death isn't that simple. There's more than meets the eye. You thought you could fool us. Master Huang is an upright man. No one would believe he'd do something like this. The murderer won't escape, let's go. Close the door. Huang Fei Hong and these 4 guys are the cause of the problem. Not only that they are our main obstacles. Then get rid of him. Yes. Damn, I said before you people are not trustworthy. All bastards. You... The jade ornaments are worth three thousand dollars. Now they're all gone. You are the constable chief you are responsible. Don't worry, Mr. Gordon. We'll catch the thief. Lin Huang restaurant. Upstairs please... What kind of tea would you like? Jasmine. Waiter, some buns please. May I sit here? Sure Jasmine tea. Good tea. I sell jade ornaments. I came by some quality goods today. Are you interested? Great. Nice colour, should be expensive. You're wrong, I got them cheap. If you are interested let's make a deal. Where's the washroom? Downstairs, round the corner. These are stolen goods. Here is the evidence, what do you have to say? Arrest them. Go... Move... These are the four. Bull shit. What proof do you have that we are the culprits? The evidence has been planted. I am sure they are the ones who committed the robbery. I fought with them. I could swear it's them. Are you sure? They are the heads of the martial arts school they are famous in town. Are you their accomplice? No. Then cut the crap. Take them out and shoot them. We must have approval from above. I am friends with your boss. I say shoot them. Madam Li... What's the matter? Brother Li and the other have been framed they have been locked up and might be shot. Hurry... What to do? I think we should find Master Huang, only he can save them. Don't be depressed. They are in trouble because of me. I'll save them even if it means risking my life. Master Huang, why are you here? My brothers are framed and have been thrown into jail. I must see them. You must help me. The authorities are looking for you everywhere, if... I'll take the responsibility. If anything goes wrong I'll not get you into trouble. Please do me this favour. Alright, come with me. Come on. Where are they? You're looking for the four masters, right? Where are they? Taken to the back, doesn't look good. Brother... Cheers... We are full Hong Hua, the dishes are quite good. You are a good cook. You're drunk. Nonsense... far from it; just a bit dizzy though. Old fox, let's go to Miss Hong's room and have a smoke. Sure. Do you mind? No problem. I have already made preparations. Let me serve you. It's okay, wait outside. I want to discuss some business with Tian Dao. Alright, I'll just keep quiet then. A woman shouldn't get involved. When the deal is done I'll reward you. Take a seat. When you said, the foreigner plans to ship all the jade to Hong Kong. Is it true? Yes. Gordon told me himself. The ship leaves at midnight tomorrow. We can't miss this chance. It all depends on you. When it comes to punches and kicks I have no problems but tricks and treachery are your forte I guess. Everything has been fixed. I'll ask Hong Hua to accompany me and seduce the foreigner on the boat. Then you take the opportunity to get rid of him. We'll get on shore at the Cactus Cave and all the jade ornaments will be ours. You're late. Why so nervous, has the foreigner arrived? Yes, he's drinking in his cabin. All the jade pieces are locked in his cabin. They'll all be ours at dawn. Have you made arrangements with our contacts? Yes. They'll come from inland and pick us up at Cactus Cave. Go, start the boat. Not yet, Da Hong Hua has not arrived. What? Bitch! I'm afraid she might mess things up for us. Miss. Master Huang, you... The foreigner set a trap and killed my 4 friends. They died unjustly. How could I let that pass? You must know where the Fox and Li Tian Dao are. You have to tell me. I heard the Fox say yesterday Gordon will ship all the jade to Hong Kong. The ship leaves at midnight. They have agreed when the ship arrives at Cactus cave they'll kill Gordon and get the jade. Damn it, how come she hasn't arrive yet? What's the matter? Don't worry, she'll come she'll not pass up this opportunity. You've got the urge again? Go and have a puff then you'll have a better business acumen. Okay, just a minute. Any place? Of course, I have reserved your usual place you haven't been here for a while. Have some tea... Please... I am going to Hong Kong. Come and have a puff. Right away. Li Tian Dao, you are so comfortable. You have the urge too? Here, my treat. No thanks, take me to meet someone. Who? The foreigner Gordon who killed 4 of my brothers. I want him dead. Alright, let's go. Is miss Hong here yet? She's here. Start the boat... Miss Hong, Mr. Gordon wants you in his cabin. It's up to you now. Damn you, I'm not doing it. Be good, go on. Miss Hong, come... I have jade ornaments to show you. What are you doing? Mr. Gordon, this is outrageous. She is in fact my wife. What would you do? Well... What do you want? Your life. What's the matter? Nothing. It's Fu Mun up ahead. Stop the boat... Mercy... I want the whole crate of jade ornaments. Take it, but spare my life. We live by principles you came by this so I'll let you go. Thanks... From now on we go separate ways. If you try anything I'll kill you. We have no one to help us now. Guess we'll just wait here and die. Godpa, don't be sad. Li Tian Dao can't escape. How come? I heard your plan that day at my home. I have informed master Huang he'll wait for Li Tian Dao on the shore. What are you laughing at? Great... You fell for my trap. Let's go ashore. The best is yet to come, let's go. Give it to me and come along to the authorities. Catch. Move... Master Huang, the authorities have found out that you have been framed. This is the evidence against Deng Xi and Li Tian Dao. Please approach the authorities as a witness. They'll get what they deserve. Alright, I'll go. Thanks, take them away. Master Huang, don't believe them. The police are Deng Xi's men. Let's split. Hurry. You have nowhere to go. Come with me to the authorities. Thanks everyone... Master Huang. Miss Hong, what an honour! Congratulations, Bao Zhi Lin is in business again. Thanks... inside please. Who are you looking for? Ah Kuan. Ah Kuan... He was here just now where has he gone? I have to go back to the theatre. Ask him to come, I'll wait for him. Okay... he will come definitely. I am going. Everyone, inside please. Hey, you have taken the wrong way. This is the short cut
