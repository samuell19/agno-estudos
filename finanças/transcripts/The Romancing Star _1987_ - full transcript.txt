Hey. Am I driving fast enough? Is it fast enough? Is my car fast enough? Where did Wu Jun-siu ask us to pick him up? At the corner ahead. Miss, I'm a Baptist College student. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? Aren't you too old? My classmates and I look about the same. I'll ask my questions now. What kind of magazines do you read? - Porn magazines. - Okay. What hobbies do you have? - Playing mahjong. - Okay. What type of men do you like? Fat and short, less than five feet three inches, looks dumb, has small eyes, a big mouth, but drives a Ferrari. Honey, hop in! Be patient, Baptist kid. Hop in and wipe your mouth or even your thick skin will get infected! Did you think I didn't have a ride? - This is considered a car? - What? Are you a man if you're so short? This is the king of the road in Repulse Bay. Dare to have a race? You want to race with me? - What? - Do you want to bet? - How much? - Okay. Come on, let's bet. Everything I have, 300 dollars. Okay, 3,000 dollars against your 300 dollars. Hey, turn on the turbo. We are far behind. - Don't worry, we have plenty of time. - What? - Catch up to him, quick. - Still trying to catch up? To hell with you! He threw sugarcanes at me! Stop! We're doomed. Did you know you were going over 90 just now? Sir, I am a good citizen. The car in front was going over 100. I was catching up to tell him not to drive so fast. Cut the crap. I will call another cop to catch him. Drive carefully. - Don't go so fast. - Thank you. Won't we lose then? You're silly. We will take the shortcut. - We're winning! - We're winning! - What's going on? - What? We're out of gas. You're out of gas. I will have your 300 dollars. DN3627, you are charged with dangerous driving in Repulse Bay. - Follow me to the station. - What? Cut the crap. Pay up. We won. Give me the money. KIN'S GARAGE Those three damn guys. It's 9:10 a.m. and they're not here yet. What are they doing now? It's so hot! - Good thing Mr. Kin isn't here yet. - How do you know? I don't see him, so he's not here. Who opened the garage then? - Mr. Mystery. - Mr. Mystery? Don't come near me. I'm crazy, I'll kill you! Come on. Come. I was kidding. Kidding? Who is kidding with you? It's just that I have retired. When I was in the triad, you were still nowhere to be found. Who doesn't know me, Wan Tau Hom's Young Mark? It has nothing to do with me. - I'll get to work. - Nothing to do with you? It has nothing to do with him. It has nothing to do with me. They raced, not me. - Traitor. - Traitor. I'm a traitor? Go to Mr. Ho to talk about loyalty! Excuse me, is Mr. Kin in? That's me. What is it? Mr. Chung in Taiwan told me to come here. He told me to give you this letter. Mr. Chung gives me trouble all the time. Guess what it is. Look. The words are so small that my eyes hurt. When I did business in Taiwan-- What kind of business? Just say you were in jail. Don't think you're still a gang leader. There are no gang leaders here! I haven't been a gang leader for ages. Then why are you stepping on my toes for so long? It's hard to get a job since you were in jail. Luckily, I mainly collect rubbish here. He's my cousin, Fat Big Mouth. He's my sworn brother, Traffic Light. He's Wu Jun-siu, my ex-girlfriend's brother. - What's your name? - Ho. - Say hi. - Ho. Mr. Kin, can I work here? What can I say? Based on my relationship with Mr. Chung, my character and your experience, of course not! - So I can't work here? - No. If I let you stay here, Shing will not let this go. I'll stay out of this. Here's ten dollars, go back to being a gang leader. - Ten dollars? - Mr. Kin, how can you do that? - You can't treat him like that! - Then what should I do? Give him 15 dollars, so he can leave Tsim Sha Tsui. I don't have change. You give it to him first. - Come in and get your pay later. - Ho. Ho, you are my idol! People call me Young Mark. I've saved a bit of money after working all these years. Take them all! Thank you. - Get your pay, smart ass! - Get your pay. Don't poke my head again. I swore never to let anyone poke my head again. When did you swear that? When I ate with my mother when I was a child, she used to poke my head whenever I said something wrong. She forced me to finish all the rice. Luckily, my father helped me finish it. But it got worse. She asked my grandmother to poke my head too. She forced me to finish the leftovers from the day before. From then on, I swore never to let people poke my head. - What if people do? - What if people do? - Well, I'll get my pay! - You bastard! - Help! They poked my head! - Hey... - I'll poke you. - He's an adult. Why are you poking him? - He pretended to be Mark. - I'm not asking the reason. It doesn't hurt that way. Jab him like this. - I'll jab you... - No... - Hello. - Hello. Kin's Garage. You're looking for Fat? - Hey, it's Man. - It's Man. Man, it's me. They're my colleagues. The usual place at 3:00 p.m.? Okay, see you later. - Bring another girl! - She hung up. How sweet! Is that your girlfriend? No, her mom. Are you dating her or her mom? They're a package. I've been with Man for three years. Three of us always go out together. Can you even hold hands? Of course. I can hold her mom's hand. What's taking them so long? When Mr. Kin comes back and doesn't see us, we'll be in trouble! Big Mouth, you always speak foul languages. Can you behave in front of your mother-in-law? Of course. If I speak foul languages, she will get angry! My mother-in-law is incredible. She teaches cooking on television. I know, it's Mrs. Due! That's right. Don't tell her I just smoked. Over there. Get me the application form for the university's extracurricular course. We're not playing snooker? No! Fat. Ma'am. - Ma'am. - Ma'am. Just call me Mrs. Due. Ma'am, they're my colleagues. He is Traffic Light, the Chief Mechanical Engineer. He is Wu Jun-siu, the Executive General Manager. You mean a technician and an admin. - Man. - Did you two smoke? - That's crazy! - That's crazy! No. We didn't smoke. Smoking causes cancer. Don't say I didn't warn you. Take a seat, ma'am. Sit. It's your turn. Tomorrow is Mom's birthday. Be there by 6:00 p.m. She said you can play mahjong with them if there aren't enough players. If there are enough players, you will help entertain the guests. - All right. - And? Mom picked out a 250-gram gold peach. She said that's our present to her. She didn't pick it, I did. Ma'am, you should be called Mrs. Greedy instead of Mrs. Due. Fat, choose your friends wisely if you want to be successful. These bad friends will get you in trouble sooner or later. Ma'am is always very frank. If you have a stinky mouth, you'll die faster. I forgive you for being rude. Midgets always have an inferiority complex and are psychologically imbalanced. Fat, either we leave or she leaves. You make the choice. Of course I'll leave! Arguing with uneducated people degrades my character! - Man, let's go! - Mom. Ma'am, let me explain! Before your two bad friends apologize to me, you can't see Man. - Mom. - Man... Go away, bitch! You really got me in trouble! What? You want us to apologize? You have to! You two must go to the birthday party with me tomorrow. LONGEVITY - Big Mouth! - What's the matter? - How can I help you? - Sorry. Man and her parents are coming. - Ma'am, sir. - Ma'am, sir. This is my friend, Wong Yat-fat and his colleagues. This is my dad. - Sorry for yesterday, ma'am. - Sorry, ma'am. - We were wrong. - Yes. Yes, ma'am. Forgive them. How would I dare not forgive them? They look like thieves. I'm afraid the triad will take revenge for them. - Help yourselves! - Yes. Fat, thanks for the gold peach, jade pendant and diamond watch. Help yourselves. Gold peach, jade pendant, and diamond watch? Yesterday, Mom said she was upset. So she bought more gifts to ease her anger. Don't forget to give her the money later. ls your mom's nickname Greedy? - Hey, it's so boring, let's go. - I'm not bored. - Yes, you are. - I'm not! You are, let's go! I'm bored too. I can be alone with you at last. Man, come. Come see your great-uncle. She's coming, ma'am! - This is my daughter. - She's all grown up. Come on. Drink it, bottoms up. Drink it. Come in! - Mr. Ho! - Wu Jun-siu, what a coincidence. Cheers. Mr. Ho, something is wrong. Somebody hid a pistol in a flower pot. - So what? - Didn't you watch A Better Tomorrow ? After hiding the pistol in the pot, he opened the door and fired. That's crazy. Why hide the gun if he wants to fire it? We can talk about this. Where is Shing? I want to kill him! You're looking for Shing? He's not here! - Don't lie, I know he's in Fung Lam Court! - This is not Fung Lam Court. It's Wu Dor Court. I'm in the wrong place? Where's my gun? Where's my gun? Damn, there are so many pots. Which one is it? Let me introduce you. - This is Principal Chan, - Hi. - Councilor Kan and Priest Fan. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - This is Dr. Wong. - That's you. - How do you do? Fat, I didn't know they bet so high. I lost over 10,000 dollars. You're such an asshole. I told you not to gamble, you bastard. You thought you could make money. We're in trouble now. It's not right to gamble. Am I right, sir? Let's take a seat over there. Okay. I don't mean that, ma'am! Shut up, you're in trouble. Please sit. Man, come here! You two get lost! I really didn't mean it, ma'am! I originally wanted to give you a chance. But I realize that you are hopeless. Man will never see you again! Mom! Tomorrow, I'll get you a pair of glasses. How can you like someone like him? - Congratulations. Mr. Ho, cheers. - What are you talking about? Mr. Ho, drink with me. I'm not drunk! - Come on. Cheers. - Go away. Right, leave with your two bad friends! Ma'am, what about the cake? Give it to those factory girls. No, ma'am. It's only for you! - Mom! - Endure everything but your wife! You are the worst! -Let's go have fun! - You're shitty. Fat, stop sighing! Everybody knows you're brokenhearted. No, I was the one who left her. Yes. You should be happy! If you marry her, her mom will shorten your life by 30 years. That's right! If I were you, I'd travel. Then it will be easy to forget her. You're right. I should travel. But it's not good to travel alone. - Just pay for us to go with you. - Right! You fool, that money is for my wedding. - You can just save up again. - That's right. Let's use your money to travel. Don't worry. Give me the money, I'll arrange it. - You have the money! You saved it for me! - You... That's not right. - You're denying it? - What are you doing? - Deny? - Are you kidding? - You are setting me up! - Hey. - Setting you up? - Hey! CENTURY TRAVEL AND TOURS Do you want to join the HKTS Superstar Tour? - Yes. - Give us a 30 percent discount. Okay, pay up first! - Any benefits? - Any benefits? Yes, your plane leaves in the morning and comes back at night. You stay at the best hotel in Penang with a sauna in your room.

Hey, let's get on board! I told you not to worry! It's obviously a grand tour by the look of the coach. Right? TOUR BUS SCHOOL BUS - What did you say? - What did you say? I said it's obviously a so-so tour by the look of the coach. It's not a problem, just get on. Please get in, thank you! - I'll go first! - I'll go first! - Do you want me to beat you up? - Don't be upset! - This is an old car. - Excuse me. These seats are for those two special men. - Please get off. - Why do they have special seats? - Get off and we'll talk. - How troublesome. Does he have epilepsy? Get in. - What do we do then? - They have special seats. They paid a special seat fee. So they can have special seats, okay? - But it's a super value tour. - Right. That's right. You're from Hong Kong and they're from Taiwan. Those two are from Singapore. Hence, HKTS Superstar Tour. And I thought Brigitte Lin and Slyvia Chang would join this tour. You're just playing with words! I don't know. I take care of things in Hong Kong. My friend takes care of things in Penang. Ask him. Go ahead, I'll let you handle it. I respect your boss, so it's okay! - It's full! - Where do I sit then? I'm so scared. Everybody, we're here. Get off. - Get off. - Fatty, let me help you. All right. Over there, hurry! Everybody, this is your room. Sleep early, you have to wake up early tomorrow. - Already? - Hey. - Where is the sauna bath? - Hey. It's only available from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. It'll be hotter than a sauna when you close all the windows. Hey. - We've been had! - Is he kidding? We've been ripped off. This is an awful room. Bull's-eye. - There's a dead body! - What? - Dead body? - Dead body? - It's the dead body of a fish. - You're nuts! Close it. Is it a real air conditioner or is it just a facade? - Turn it on and we'll know. - Yes. - Gosh! -Looks like we can't sleep tonight. Turn it off. - Me? - Turn it off. - We've had a long trip, let's rest. -Let's rest. Where do you want to sleep? - Are you ready to perform now? - What? It's stated that there's a performance every day. You'll go tonight. The Taiwanese will go tomorrow. We're performing? - You must be crazy! - You're crazy! Fine, give me 100 dollars each and I'll represent you. - That's robbery. - That's robbery. Perform then! I'll pay. I'll write you a check for 500 dollars. Hurry! How about shows just for the adults? Yes, I'll bring you to see how they castrate cats. - Castrate cats? - Right, adults only! You can't see that in Hong Kong. Sir, 500 dollars. Thank you, we'll just stay here tonight.

SCHOOL BUS This is the famous reclining Buddha in Penang. Tourists will surely come here when they visit Penang. It has performed lots of miracles. I only ate a banana in two days. I'll die if I don't get any food. I'm hungry. - Here it comes. - Here is your food. I'll dig in. Don't rush, you'll mess up the chicken. You call that a chicken? It is a famous local dish called Tasty Chicken. It's not for eating, just for looking. - Chicken? - Take a good look. I'll take it away. It's the next table's turn. When can we really eat? Do you want to starve us? It's coming now. - Hey, give them some water. - Okay. Let's eat. Go ahead. You should cover your mouth when sneezing. Don't fight. Don't be mad. - Give it to me. - You can't do that. Damn it! Hey. - Hey. - Raise your hands. Who wanted to join this tour? - You! - You! I only take advantage of others.

I only came to see your master. I'm sorry, it's him who wants to search you. - Our master is very rich. - Me? We're afraid his uncle might harm him for money. Get away! Is he mute? That's silent communication. Our master studied miming in England. He doesn't talk easily. He likes to express himself through body language. - Yes. - What did he say? He said he has been enjoying this place for two days. I see. That's Tung-tung, I'm Man-chi. You want to have dinner with us, right? You're clever. I'm Traffic Light. He is Lau Ting-kin.

The stage is over there. - Go. - Come on. Okay, let's start. An ambitious youth was addicted to drugs. Drugs dragged him into poverty. He encountered a strong storm and was blown in different directions. So he thought of committing suicide. After some thought, he didn't want to die after all. He wants to die, but he doesn't. He wants to die, but he doesn't. He wants to die, he doesn't, he does, he doesn't... He doesn't want to die, he does, he doesn't, he does... Hey, it's my turn. Don't be scared. Suddenly, he heard something. The voice told him to find his ex-girlfriend. So he went to find her. He found that his ex-girlfriend has turned into a fat woman. And she has a body odor. She said she could lend him money, but she wanted him to sleep with her. Let me do it! The young man felt happy, sad, excited, delighted, and horny. Horny. Very horny. All these emotions were playing in his mind. He struggled and struggled, and finally decided to refuse her. He decided to refuse her. But this woman... You do it. Me again? But the woman was cruel. She broke his left leg and right hand. With a broken leg and hand, what could he do? So he used one leg to fight the villain while he jumped around. But he broke his left hand too. With no other choice, he kicked the villain with his good leg. Hey, even an actor would die from all this. Shut up, let's thank the audience. - Great! - Great! Well done. - It's late, we have to leave now. - Great, right? - So early? - So early? Early? There's plenty of time. Call me tomorrow. - There was no attraction at all. - Goodness. I've fallen in love. - Great... - Great... Get up! There's no need to wake us up. We're not going sightseeing. - Hurry, you're going back to Hong Kong. - What? What the heck? It's a seven-day tour!

I want to date her. - Are you qualified to date her? - Of course. I'm rich, tall and handsome. How old are you? I'm 17. What is that noise? Well, my dog sneezed. She has got a cold. Shut up, Susanna! Kin. If you're so handsome, you can surely win her heart. What is the problem? The problem is, I have two rivals. One is Traffic Light, the other is Wu Jun-siu. So? They're not good people. Traffic Light gambles. He's poor, competitive and despicable. I'm a decent person, so they can easily ambush me. - He's talking about you. - Tell him to go to hell. What about the other one, Wu Jun-siu? He is even worse. He is a dwarf and he's lascivious. He doesn't like to brush his teeth. His mouth stinks. They are stupid to compete with me for a girl. What? You're the stupid one! Sorry, some interference interrupted our conversation. That means you have two rivals. Lady Pak, how can I get rid of them and not seem petty? They work for me. That's simple, triple their pay. - Feed them shark's fin daily - Nice. and take them to nightclubs. Then they will think that you have an evil plan. They'll be afraid and resign. What do you think? Not bad. - I want to dedicate a song. - For whom? For the cutest and sexiest Man-chi, whom I love. I wish her eternal youth. Okay, I'll play a song for you. - How? - How do we do it? An old English song. It's called Only You . Bastards! Bastards, stay where you are! Mr. Kin, you're still playing around at your age? Well, just getting some exercise. What can I do for you? My car has a problem, help me check it. I'll be back later. Okay. You like dancing? No, I don't know how to dance. You don't? It's Retro Night at my disco tonight. I'll give you two complimentary tickets. - Don't waste it. Remember to come - Thank you. or give them to someone else, okay? I don't have use for it. Hey. - What? - How are two tickets enough?

Hers is quite handsome. But the other three look like three idiots. They're tall, short, fat, and thin. How lucky. You can enjoy dating. - I can't do that anymore. - Hey. You've agreed to marry Fatty? He just wouldn't give up. He pestered me day and night. I surrendered at last. I'm more eager to get married than him now. Men are jerks. After some time, he may not want to marry you. Congratulations, you don't have to work anymore. Don't let our boss know. I'm going to teach her a lesson right before I leave. You're all here.

I can fire you anytime. Tung-tung, you're free. Tattoo my eyebrows. Okay. What a bitch! Hi, More Than Beautiful Beauty Center. Hi, is this Man-chi? Yes, who is this? It's Traffic Light.

Before confirming your feelings for him, don't embarrass yourself. I'm definitely in trouble this time. I have no clothes for the party. That's easy. My sister is studying in the States. She has a lot of beautiful dresses. I'll let you try them. That's not good. It's fine, my parents are on a business trip to Europe. I'm the boss here. You can tell your boyfriend to pick you up here. KIN'S GARAGE INTENSIVE HYPNOTHERAPY You're not Big Mouth. You're Mr. Crazynova... No, you're Mr. Casanova. You're polite and you speak elegantly. I speak so elegantly. Will he become like this all his life? There's a password. When you hear "I'm rich," you'll come to your senses and go back to normal. I totally get it. Wake up. Can I go now? Excuse me, where's the car? At the entrance. I'll go with you. Hello, Man-chi? How about tonight? Nine o'clock? Okay, see you. Man-chi, why was your phone busy? You were checking the weather? How about tonight? Eleven o'clock? All right then. - My sister is coming, please wait. - Thank you. Ms. Tung. You look so charming tonight. Remember to come home early. Mom and Dad will be waiting for you. - Okay. -Little girl. You're so cute. I can't stand your boyfriend. This way, please. The moon looks like a lemon tonight. This way. Look, tonight's Retro Night will surely be exciting. I think so too. - This way. - This way. Mr. Chiu. Thank you for coming. Kenny, I always support your events. You're Humphrey Bogart, and she's Ingrid Burman. I bet you will win the grand prize tonight. There are so many beautiful people here tonight. How can I win? Is this trophy nice? You'll win it. Hold it first. Ms. Tung. What would you like to drink? What are you saying? Are you playing around? Did I make you angry? No. That's a relief. I want to be rude to you only to see you get angry. You make my heart beat so fast. We didn't order the champagne. It's from Mr. Chiu. The flower is from Mr. Chiu too. He is a famous bachelor, Chiu Ting-sin. I didn't know. To me, Cheung Wood-yau is the most handsome guy. Everyone, for tonight's Retro Night, aside from King of the Night, we have a retro dance contest too. It's not cha-cha, tango or even pachanga . It's the Orange Dance from the movie, Charade . Okay, you will pass the orange using your neck. Don't use your hands. There's an envelope on your table. Those who get chosen to play, please come out. PLAY We can play. -Let's go. - We're so lucky. Please. - We got chosen. - Yes. -Let's go. - Okay. - You can't play! - What? Okay, these six guests can play our game. You can't drop the orange, or you'll get disqualified. Get ready! Let's start! Eat it! - What a pity. He deserves it. - Mr. Chiu. What happened? Where's the orange? - Are you okay? - Mr. Chiu. Excuse me. I need to remove the excess water from my body. I'm sorry. Come on. You're good. Don't get upset, it's only a game. I, Chiu Ting-sin, swear that I will get your girlfriend in ten days. You have a bad breath. Maybe you haven't brushed your teeth in ten days. I'm sorry. Go... - Wait and see! - Go! Great! I'm rich! I won the special prize in the lotto! So what? Lower your voice, scum! Watch out. People might scam you, idiot. Are you all right? Have oranges caused death before? What's happening? No one won the Orange Dance. But I've got the result for the King of the Night. He is... The champion is Mr. Chiu Ting-sin... His neighbor. - That's us. - That's us. We won! -Let's go! - Okay. Congratulations, what's your name? - I'm Fat. She's Tung-tung. - Hello, Mr. Fat. This thing is in our way, what is it? The microphone. - Microphone? - Mr. Fat. You're the champion tonight. Would you like to say something? Of course, idiot! Is everybody happy? Me and my chick are happy too! Chick? It's okay. It's the same. Is there a cash prize? There's a prize for you. - A prize! - That's good. Damn it. And you don't have to pay the entrance fee for one year. How stingy. I have nothing to say. I'll save my breath. I like how you spoke earlier. I'll tell you. I come here to stare into space often. Aren't you afraid of being robbed? Why? There are so many cops around. There are no cops around. I'll rob you. You made my dress dirty. That's why being rich is really troublesome. We need to think of our status and our clothes. How troublesome. Right. Sometimes, I want to go to food stalls, but I'm afraid they're dirty. I want to shop at Ladies' Market, but I'm afraid it might be too cheap. - It's better to be poor. - It's better to be poor. Dried fish and peanut congee! Someone is selling congee. Yes. What is dried fish? I always eat shark fin and chicken congee. - Right. - I've never tried that. l wonder if it tastes nice. Let's pretend to be poor and try. Come. - Sir, two bowls of congee. - Okay. One is enough. We're poor now. - We'll share. - Right. - One bowl, please. - Okay. Do you want fried bread? - Two fried bread. - Hey. One is enough. We're poor. One is enough. - How much is it? - Four dollars. You don't have change for 1,000 dollars, right? Luckily, I have four dollars. Come, let's eat over there. You bastard, you're playing tricks on me? Here. You like it? You can have all of it. Actually, many couples are just employees. They're as happy as the rich. Yes. If we were both poor, what do you think would happen? - You'd surely fall for me. - What? No. I mean, we can share everything. A shooting star! Make a wish! They say it's the most effective if you make a wish before it disappears. - What was your wish? - To get rich. Don't you have money? Who said I don't have money? You're already rich, but you want more money. Happiness lies in contentment. I can donate to more charities if I am richer. What wish did you make? I won't tell you. Don't ask me. I'll force you to tell me! Dried fish and peanut congee! You're so annoying! Help! Again? Dried fish and peanut congee! I'll tickle you! Dried fish and peanut congee! KIN'S GARAGE Hey. Why are you so happy? Last night was raging. Look! Indeed. Who kissed you? Man-chi, of course! I bought a box of firming toners with half of my pay. Then she kissed me! They're good stuff. Where should I apply it? Man-chi said anywhere you want to. You'll be pretty. -Let me help you. - Help me. My skin feels terrible. Well, it just feels cool. There, I feel it. I feel it! It's contracting upwards. Everything is going upwards! Help me to pull it down! - It's... - Here. Never use it! It's toxic! I was lucky last night! Somebody kissed you too? Hold these. Look closely. Who kissed you? The one who you think about and the one who thinks about me, Man-chi. You're lying, your mom kissed you! I was with her last night. When were you with her? We went for a movie at 9:30 p.m. But she left before the movie ended. Of course, someone handsome was waiting for her outside. Wouldn't she dump the dwarf then? I bought two boxes of firming toners with my one-month pay. How can that be? It's right, one kiss for each box. That's not right! Look. - Why? -Look... Did you go out with Man-chi? Did Man-chi kiss you? Did it happen last night? Right, she was with me at 7:00 p.m. She told me to keep it a secret from you two. Of course. She dated them at 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. She kissed them after selling those firming toners. That's crazy. I didn't have to buy firming toners for kisses. I refused to let her kiss me, but she kept insisting. I couldn't take it anymore and let her kiss me. Delivery. - What delivery? - Who is Lau Ting-kin? - He is. - He is. - I am. - We are delivering 200 boxes of firming toners. - You bought 200 boxes? - You bought 200 boxes? - You bought 200 boxes! - So what? Let me tell you. Man-chi only loves me. You don't stand a chance! Wu Jun-siu, I suggest joining forces to go against our rival. Ma'am, they are insane! Man-chi, let's go out again. Right, where? East Tsim Sha Tsui, same as last night. Okay. Good, see you later. I'll be right there after I shower. Bye. I'll put on some fragrance, so I'll smell really good. Someone is looking for you. Who is it? I'm taking a shower. I'm not taking visitors. The police. Why? If I knew, I would be a policeman. How troublesome. Blocking the street? It's just 200 boxes. Just get them all in. I'm going to shower. Don't disturb me. Don't ask for help, I won't give you a hand. - I'll jab you! - I'll block it! You blocked it? Damn you! It's warm, how nice. - It's done. See for yourself. - You might kill him! - It will shrink... - So what? He always takes advantage of people. He should learn a lesson. At most, he'll shrink to my size. Don't worry. They must have put the firming toner in the tub. I must do something. Help! Hey, the wipers are stuck. Fix them for me, please. - Only the wipers, right? Okay. - Be quick! No problem. Where's the toilet? Inside. In there? Hey! A weirdo! - A weird pervert! - What's wrong? Mr. Kin! How are you? Those two bastards want to kill me! - They put the firming toner in my tub. - Gosh. - This is bad. What should we do? - I... That's him. The lady said he flashed himself. He's my brother. He had epilepsy when he was a kid. He kept having epileptic attacks and turned out this way. He is mentally retarded, sir! He doesn't know what he is doing. Mentally retarded? He really doesn't know what he is doing. Why do the lines sound so familiar? What a tragedy! Right. Miss, I don't think you want to sue him, right? How can I? Yes, I'm leaving then. Thank you. Miss, the wipers are fixed. - I'll get going then. - Miss. Miss, I'm really hungry. Buy me some food. I don't have time. But I'll give you 1,000 dollars. Here. - Buy your own food. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. - Thank you. - See you. You never waste any chance to make money. Damn you. I want the money for medical care. Call an ambulance. I'll kill those bastards when I see them. Your target is Tung Man-yuk, nicknamed Tung-tung. She's 22 years old. A high school graduate. She's a beauty consultant. Her pay is 2,800 dollars a month. She's also a tutor and is paid 1,200 dollars a month. She is 5 feet 6 inches tall. Her measurements are 34-23-35. Her shoe size is five. She is near-sighted. She has a mom. Her dad left home ten years ago after an argument with her mom. She loves stinky tofu, fish balls and pig's skin. She has a good friend named Man-chi, who's also a beauty consultant. What about the guy? He is Wong Yat-fat, nicknamed Big Mouth. He is 30 years old, an immigrant from China. He just got his permanent residency. He is a technician in a garage. He has no fixed income and his boss is mean. He is six feet tall. He has no girlfriend because he sleeps naked. So they're both pretending to be rich. Mr. Chiu, based on my computer's analysis, if you reveal Fat's real identity to Ms. Tung, your chance of dating her will increase by 55 percent. I only have five days left. I must succeed or I'll be humiliated. How do you define success? She'll be like a fallen flower that I'll step on twice. I understand, Mr. Chiu. He will surely lose. Look at this car. There's no windshield or wheels. Well-deserved. Luckily, we didn't park our car here. No, we parked our car here. Is this our car? No way. KIN'S GARAGE I worked so hard to get you four tires. But I couldn't get you an engine or windshield. I'm in trouble if there's no engine. What do we tell Mr. Kin when he returns? What can we say? We can only negotiate. I don't know what to tell him. Sorry! Damn. Damn, he is back. Damn. Mr. Kin. Clean it up. The client will come for the car today. Okay, it's clean and shiny already. No, I have to check it myself. He is a new customer. We need to make a good impression. Why is it so quiet when you're wiping the windshield? No. Right, wipe harder! Okay. What are you doing, Mr. Kin? - Checking the car. - Checking the car? This car's engine is so powerful. Did you fix the radio? I think so. Announcement. Due to our boss' event, we're stopping the broadcast for today. Station Three is attending and stopping the broadcast too. Don't listen to the radio today and just watch the television. This is the end of our broadcast. Thank you, bye. How can this be? Mr. Kin, what do you think? Not bad. One more thing, check the wipers. Where is the windshield? - It's gone. - Gone? Damn you. I'll beat you up! Was that fun? Run faster. Stop. - Why? - Come. You're in luck! Mr. Chiu will pay you 20,000 dollars each to film a commercial. Mr. Chiu, these are our instructors. This is Li Man-chi, and she's Tung Man-yuk. Ms. Tung, what a coincidence. So you're that pretty girl. Don't forget me. We're a package. Wherever she is, there's me. Of course I want to get the two of you. Mrs. Kam said you paid 50,000 dollars for us to film a commercial. - Yes. - Good price, right? Take your time. I'll go entertain our guests. Well, Ms. Tung, can we have the screen test now? Sure, but we will still charge you 5,000 dollars for that. Mr. Chiu, something is wrong with the car. Take it to Kin's Garage. The three of you are bastards! Luckily, I found the engine. If not, I'll deal with you! KIN'S GARAGE Damn it, the client is coming to pick up the car. Mr. Kin, is my car ready? Almost. But I want my car now. Fat. You work here? No way. So what? Isn't being a mechanic a decent job? I thought you were a millionaire. - That's none of your business! - Hey. I don't care if you're poor or not. But I'll care since you took my car to pretend to be rich. Even the windshield is gone. What's going on? I think Wong Yat-fat tricked you and pretended to be rich. That's impossible. Fat is not a liar. Do you admit it? Don't be so cocky. I won't be humiliated in front of you. But I think you will be poor your entire life. Look at you, even your pants have holes. And you're pursuing Ms. Tung? You're overestimating yourself. Fat. Tung-tung? You're a mechanic here? Right, he went bankrupt and started working here. - What do you mean? - What do we mean? He gambled with us and lost all his money. He's poor now. Yes. Now, I am the boss here. He's a loser. - A loser... - A loser... - A loser... - Stop it! Don't return kindness with ingratitude. Never mind, enough. Yes, I admit that I love to gamble! Mr. Chiu. I know I'm bad! Hit me! Mr. Chiu, I know I'm bad! Hit me! Hit me... - Hey. - Don't stop me! Let me tell you. It's just money. You can start afresh. Isn't that how it works in dramas? - Right. - But you should have told Ms. Tung. - Right? - Right! - Right! - It would be fine then. Fat, I'll be with you whether you're rich or poor. Don't let them look down on you. Of course! Mr. Chiu, I'm sorry. I want out of the commercial. I want to be with him. -Let's go. - Thank you. Get lost! You three bastards! - Man-chi, you're here? - Man-chi, you're here? Yes, I heard everything! You three are useless scums! Rubbish! Right. They enticed me to trick Fat for his money. I realized my mistake. I've turned over a new leaf. I've decided to deal with them together with you. Damn you, you betrayed us! I'm just enforcing justice. I'm sorry. I'm on justice's side too. I'm the only bad guy? I quit. Let me tell you, we were all lying earlier. - Stop, disloyal traitor. - Stop, disloyal traitor. Say it! Don't be afraid. What does loyalty have to do with love? With love, there's loyalty. Without love, loyalty is nothing. Let me tell you, I'm the boss here. The three of them work for me. Fat has never been rich. He has always worked here. How could you say that? - Despicable! - Tung-tung, I don't know what he means. - Don't listen to him! - Despicable! Despicable! - Despicable? - Despicable! You hit me? - Tung-tung! -Let her go. Let her calm down and explain later. - Are you looking for my daughter? - Yes, ma'am. Don't speak. Let me lead the conversation. Ma'am, we came here to apologize to your daughter. - Yes. - Yes. Are you her friends? The two of us are just her ordinary friends. He is her boyfriend. No, he is her close friend. - Right, close friend. - Yes. When did you meet? Not long ago. When they met, they... They fell in love at first sight. - Right. - Right. Then it's not Tai-chu. Is it Sai-chu? What do you want? Well, he made your daughter angry. - Yes. - So he came to apologize and propose. - Yes. - You bastards! She won't get married this early! - He's mad. - Bluff him. You have no choice. She's pregnant. What can you do? What? Didn't she tell you? I'll call the cops to arrest you. Ask Sai-chu to come down! Everyone is responsible for themselves. How can you arrest us? - Right. - My daughter is not even 16 yet! But she looks all grown up! Am I eight years old then? Tell me, how did you meet them? Sai-chu, where is your sister? Sister? She's in the States. She hasn't returned for many years. - What are you talking about? - Ma'am. We just saw each other a few days ago. - Sai-chu was with us. - Right! Sai-chu, tell us what's going on! That's Tung-tung. Why are you staring into space? I'm not sure if I should be mad with Fat. Of course! He pretended to be rich and tricked you. But I did the same thing. He's a man, so he should take the blame. Tung-tung, someone is looking for you! Coming. Man-yuk. Dad! Man-yuk. Dad! Your dad is rich now. We're not poor anymore. I went to Africa ten years ago after fighting with your mom to do business. I bought a piece of land and there were diamonds! I'm rich now! Dad, regardless if we're poor or rich, just come home and live with us. We'll be happy no matter what. - Dad. - Man-yuk. This is great. Come and chat inside. I'll go buy some drinks and cake. Hey. We have an ace up our sleeves now. We'll surely succeed. We failed last time because we listened to you. You say it. We have an ace up our sleeves now. We'll surely succeed. - Right! - Come on. - You've lost weight. - Tung Man-yuk, you bitch. Come out. What's happening out there? What are you doing here? - To scold you! - To scold you! What can you scold me for? You're shameless and you pretended to be rich! You pretended that your student's house was yours and tricked Fat to fall in love with you! We're both the same. Tung-tung, I... You're superficial and quick to switch sides. You get on with lots and lots of boys. - You-- - Fatty. You're having a blast scolding her. - I am! - Ignore him. You got yourself a fat and rich man. He is my dad! - Dad? - Your dad? He looks more like your dad instead. - Damn! - Damn! Don't be like this. - What? Are we wrong? - Yes! My daughter is poor? - She's the daughter of a rich man! - Rich? Her money is not more than her red blood cells. -Let me tell you. I'm Tung Shi-jong. - You're pretending to be a chairman? - Then I'm a manager. - Dad. - Don't talk to them. - Wait. Here's my business card. "Tung Shi-jong, Chairman of Africa Diamond Company?" Chairman? Really? I just came back from Africa. So my daughter met bastards like you! No, Dad. My boyfriend is Chiu Ting-sin. They're just bothering me. Okay, let's go back first. If they follow us, I'll call the police. Tung-tung, I didn't mean it. - Tung-tung. Sir, ma'am! -Let's go. - Forget it! - Are you happy now? You two spoiled the whole thing! Fat, this is a private club. Come and explain to Tung-tung. Or she'll fall for another guy. Come quickly. What are you doing? She didn't answer my calls all week. She doesn't want to see me. She even sent the flowers back. It's useless! - Hey. - Hey. That's not the point. It's not about getting the girl. It's not letting others get your girl. Get her back and then dump her if you must. This is about a man's pride. Right! This is bad. They're not here yet. Will they ditch us? I'm worried too. This is their first performance. I'm not sure if they'll back out. - What are you doing here? - We... Why do you think we're here? - To dance? - Right. - Yes. - We're here to dance. - Get changed, hurry. - Get changed? Hurry! Get out and dance! - Go. - Can we not go? Sure, I will beat you up until you dance. - There's no need. - Hurry, go! - Go! - Hurry! We're dancing so hard, but they're throwing garbage at us. We can't go on dancing this way. It's Tung-tung. It's Fat. - Tung-tung! - Hey. Tung-tung, stop. Let me explain. -Let me go! - Can you listen to me? Tung-tung! - Are you a gentleman? - No. Follow her. - They give money! - They give money! - Come here! - Get away! Get away! - Move aside. - Come here! Come! - Moving chest! - Moving chest! Why isn't my chest moving? I can't work now! Why are you here? I'll scream! Scream, be my guest. Get out! Continue pissing! You, stop right there! You're unreasonable! Yes, I never claimed to be a gentleman. I'll tell you the truth. It was never my idea. I had never lied to you. Don't you have a mind of your own? Yes, but I've failed many times. This time, I don't want to lose you. I'm not educated. I'm not good with words. But I'm serious about you. Then why did you bring them to the beauty center to insult me? I didn't know they would say those things. You can blame everything on them now. If you were me, you would get mad too. We almost got arrested at Sai-chu's house. If you're mad, why did you come? You women are really sassy! I'm sassy? Not only sassy, you're also blind. You knew Chiu Ting-sin was a playboy, but you still offered yourself. I offered myself? Mind your words! You know what I'm talking about. Get out, I don't want to talk to you. I will get out, but don't mind that I'm exposing you. You girls like to use others to upset the one you love. Do you like him? You can upset men once or twice, but thrice is too much. You're playing with fire! Get out! Fine. I was born to be tormented by women. Go on, torment me until I get sick. I'm telling you. Be careful. You don't want me to care about you, so take care of yourself. I'm done! Can I come out now? That bastard, don't let me see him again! Ting-sin, why are you so angry? - Master, you have come! - Master. I heard you couldn't get a girl. How can I not help you? You can't even beat a mechanic. I have tried different methods. Have you seen Henry Cheung teach people how to dance? One, two, three, four. Go back to basics. What do you mean? You need to learn the basic expert method in pursuing a girl. With drugs? Isn't that too old-fashioned? Old-fashioned tricks are always the most effective. Back then, who among Fong Yim-fen, Red String Girl, Nam Hong and Ka Ling escaped from my clutches? Silly boy. She will sue me. Throw a party at home and invite many people. She won't know who's responsible after she faints. Afterwards, don't stay dressed and sit by the bed, silly boy! Don't tell me I don't teach you things. I've already prepared a bottle of Seven-step Fainting Drug. This is for you. I told you the show wasn't good. It's better to play mahjong. Why is there so much stuff? - Are they flu tablets? - Gosh. The tea leaves smell good! Let's make some tea. KIN'S GARAGE - Open up. - Open up. Coming! Freeze! What's up? We received information that there are drugs in this place. Who framed us? Who framed us? Who framed us? Who framed us? I asked that question! I won't ask then. You've got a visitor! I was told you were all arrested. I didn't believe it. Chiu Ting-sin, don't be cocky. I know what you are up to! Why do you think I'm here? I came to bail you out. - Are you that nice? - Yes. I don't have my wallet though. It's a weekend. I can't make a withdrawal. Wait until Monday. Don't play tricks. Tell us what you want. I came to bail you out and invite you to a party at my new home. But you can't come now. Only Tung-tung and Man-chi can have a good time with me. What do you want, bastard? I told you I'd get your girl in ten days. Don't you remember? I remember you! Hit me, the police are watching. Go ahead. I was kidding! We are friends. Why would I hit you? Fat, come over here. Don't sit there. You're good! I'm here. You just don't dare to hit me. Hit my chest. Hit my back. Poke my eyes and jab my throat. Why? You don't dare? Hey. Stay calm, take it easy. - They're insane. - It's the trend nowadays. The four of you are not real men. You want to get girls? You want to compete with me? Just polish my shoes. - When I'm tired of the girl, - Come here. you can have my secondhand item. Many people want my leftovers but can't even get it. You're threatening me? Sure, there are two cops behind me. I've never been scared of anything. Hit your chest? Hit your back? - Poke your eyes? - I'll kick your butt! - Bastard, I'll jab your throat. - Poke him! - Come on. - Come on. - Hey, are you all right? - Hey, are you all right? Damn you, who told you to go out? Don't you know who I am? So what if you're rich? You were the one who provoked them. We didn't see anything! Wait for my leftovers. Keep quiet! This is bad, what should we do? Are you my real friends? - Of course! - Of course! All right, get out there and hug the cops. Let them shoot you down. Cover me so I can save Tung-tung and Man-chi. I will never forget you. - Okay. - Okay. Wu Jun-siu. Ho, you were arrested too? No, I came to bail you out. The papers have already been processed. Ho, you're incredible! Hiding drugs is a serious crime. How did you bail us out? Only the marijuana is real. The rest are fake. I knew he bought lots of Seven-step Fainting Drugs. I don't know who he wants to use it on. - We know. - Yes. -Let's rescue her. - Yes. That's not how a rescue is done. We have to do it like this. Why are you so bored? I don't know why I still think of Fat with so many people here. You must still have feelings for him. Stop! Why are you here? There's a delivery of three statues for your boss. Let me have a look. Come in. - Which ones are ours? - The three near the door. The rest are not yours. Where is the toilet? - Use the one for the workers at the back. - Thank you. I'll go in first. Watch out for yourselves. Okay! Hey. Over there. What are these? What are they? - They're statues. - You're right, they are. This one is quite handsome. Handsome. This is very smooth. It doesn't break. How strong. They're humans, not statues. They move and hit people. - You're right. - We're not humans. We're gaming machines. One plus one equals what? - Two. - Two. Please insert coin. - Give me the money. - Okay, wait. Bet more and you get more returns. - Give him all the money. - Answer? - Two. - Two. It's not two! - What? - What? It's two! - We won. - Pay up. - Pay up. - Malfunction. - Will undergo maintenance. - Will undergo maintenance. - There's another one. - Hey. - Watch ongoing maintenance. - Pay up. What a big fly! I wonder what those two tablets are for, Mr. Chiu. Stomach tablets, for me. What about you, Mr. Chiu? Me? I'll drink. Spiking drinks? Go trick someone else. You want to drug me? Dream on. On a stormy night, you might be successful. How can this happen? The tablets were already in powder form and mixed in the two drinks. Those two I took were really stomach tablets. Then we... You've walked six steps already. One more step and you'll faint. You scum! My Seven-step Fainting Drug looks like this. Hit me. Slap me. Come on. Hit me. Come on. You've walked six steps already. One more step and you'll faint. Hit me. Come on. I won't be nice to you. Right, hit harder! Okay, I'll deal with you first! Stay away from me. - Stay away! - She's in danger. Let's rescue her! - Wait, let's see how it goes. - Why do all leading ladies say the same line? They won't stay away even after saying it. Man-chi. Mr. Chiu, it's settled. - Okay. Get my bath ready. - Okay. Mr. Chiu, the designer said it works as a jacuzzi. Why doesn't it seem so? I don't know. Is the button on the three statues? It could be this button. No. Let me check. There's no need, I can manage. There it is. It's a bit warm, but it stinks. It could be because of the new pipes. Let me check for you. There's no need, you may go. I can manage. Take your time, Mr. Chiu. There's no water. Damn you. Bastard. - What are you doing here? - Why do you care? - You're dead. - You're dead! Go after him. Come. I slid so far. - Come on. - Okay. Nothing, ten. You lose! Help... Traffic Light, help! Give me three seconds. I'll save you after I'm done here. How dare you pull a trick on me? I want you to watch me have a good time! Guard the corridor. No one is allowed to come in. Do not disturb me. Mr. Chiu, your room is soundproof. We won't know what's happening in here. I'll push the bell if I need you. - No storm, no roses to step on. - Hey! - Watch it! - This is so boring. Let me have a drink first. You bastard, go to hell! Bastard, you've taken six steps. You deserve this. You also had one. I have six more steps to go. I can jump over to kill you! - That's 6.5 steps, stop! - That's 6.5 steps, stop! Dickson, go and bite him. - Go! - Dickson, bite your master, not me. - Dickson! - Gosh! - Go, bite him! - No! You're lascivious and your dog is the same. Go there. What are you doing? Don't come, go and bite him! -Lick him! - Bite him! Go to hell! - Go to hell! - Go to hell! - They're awake! - Man-chi, get up! Tung-tung. Fat. Fat. - Fat. - Tung-tung! She's gone. - Why are you arresting me? - I have to find Tung-tung. - Tung-tung! -Let go of me! You're all alone. Aren't you worried about getting robbed? There is one thing you've never told me. What is it? What was your last wish when you saw the shooting star? Why should I tell you? Go away! You really want me to go? Yes! Okay, I'll go now, bye. Hey! Can't you say nice things to me? Why? It was easy when we both pretended to be rich. The truth is out now. I came here because I'm being sincere. Come on, let's have a chat. I hate you. You always lie to me. Didn't you lie to me too? You lied more! Okay, I lied more. I won't lie to you again. If ever I lie again, don't like me anymore. You men are so bad. Okay, all men are bad, all women are good. What wish did you make? I wished you'd only love me. No problem! Don't be shy. Come on. A shooting star! - What are you doing? - Making a wish. What are you wishing for? I wish you won't find out if I date other girls in the future. - You're so bad! - Hey... - I was joking! - No jokes like that are allowed! I really want you to be my better half. Dream on! - Dried fish and peanut congee! -Let's have a bowl. Sir, one bowl of congee and one fried bread. It's you two poor couple again. AFTER 20 YEARS Dad, he is my boyfriend. Sir, call me Frankie. What do you think? - What is it, sir? - Your name is Frankie? Yes. Are you close friends with my daughter? - Very close friends. - Wipe your mouth. You can date my daughter. But don't make her unhappy. I will take good care of her. Okay? Don't gamble. Never gamble. When I became broke after I gambled, I regretted gambling. For the past 20 years, I lied when I said I won money from gambling. That's why, no matter what happens, don't gamble. If I didn't gamble, I wouldn't be saying these words. Hey. Give me some money. Why are you walking away? He's so fierce. Are you kidding me? Five dollars? Give me five dollars more to gamble. Did you cough? Take some money to see a doctor, have dinner, gamble, dance, go to Macau, play golf, do a facelift, go to university, emigrate, and cheat people's money.
