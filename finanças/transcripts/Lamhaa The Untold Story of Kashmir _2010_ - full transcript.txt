Mohammad Hussain Rauf. Businessman. Diplomat. Possible ISI agent, sir. The biggest deal-maker.. ..for Pakistani intelligence agencies.. ..and Indian politicians, sir. Brigadier Sharma, corrupt as hell. But we don't have any proof, sir. Samar Singh. - Yes, sir. Power broker. These days he cracks all the deals. He's been spotted with Rauf many times, playing squash. What do you want to say, Brigadier? Sir, Lashkar has increased its activities in Kashmir. Elections are coming up. We have to find out what they're going to do. Then do what you have to. What are you waiting for? We have 103 agents in the valley. Have your pick. Sir, I need someone from outside. Vikram Sabrawal. 'I was returning to Kashmir after 18 years.' 'Those memories were coming back to me again.' 'y ear 1989. The procession.' 'The chaos on the street.' 'Week-long curfews.' 'And the feeling of terror and obsession for freedom in the people.' 'And during this period the Maulvi of Kashmir was murdered.' 'And the cry for a long, waging battle could be heard.' We want justice. What does freedom mean? These cruel Indian troops have openly.. ..murdered the Maulana. Infidels, savages! Infidels, savages! The Koran is our motive. The Koran is our tradition. And 'Jihad' ( Holy struggle) is our means. 'Nara-e-Takbeer'. 'The security forces..' '..couldn't differentiate between the crowd of Kashmiris.' We're in the war zone. Our enemies are present in every place, every road.. ..every village, and in every house at all times! Find him, and catch him ! If they don't surrender, shoot them. Any questions? - No, sir. Any questions? - No, sir! What's wrong? Take him. Why are you taking him? Where are you taking him? Listen to me. It's just a routine interrogation. But.. - We'll release him tomorrow morning. No.. Where are you taking me? What is my mistake? Leave me.. 'The defeat of Russia in Afghanistan..' '..made the Kashmiri's grow courageous.' Allah-O-Akbar! Allah-O-Akbar! The days of hurling stones and pebbles at the police are gone. Children, just like you've memorized the verses of Koran.. ..train yourself in Pakistan with the same focus. And whenever you feel like resting.. ..remember the injustice done to your mothers, your sisters. By the grace of Allah, we'll surely win this war. Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi. Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi ! 'The situation became so bad..' '..that Kashmiri pundits were compelled to part with Kashmir..' '..leaving everything behind.' 'No one tried to stop them..' '..and the reputation of Kashmir was tarnished forever.' 'The ambience had changed.' 'A race that was known for its non-violence..' '..was now toying around with automatic guns.' Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi. Next Friday, we'll meet at Pindi. - 'Every youth wanted to be a martyr.' 'The people of Kashmir believed..' '..that soon the flag of independent Kashmir..' '..would soar over Sri Nagar's secretariat.' The environment and ambience can change anytime. Welcome to Kashmir, the most dangerous place in the world. And the most beautiful, sir. You'll have to don a new identity to crack this mission. Gul Jehangir. This name will give you many opportunities. Money is not a problem. You'll get all you need. This is a highly confidential mission. You can be in danger at anytime and from anyone. You can't trust anybody. Nothing has changed in 18 years. The same hatred and detestation. God made heaven. Man created hell. This is the story of Kashmir. Even if the whole of Kashmir turns into a graveyard.. ..there'll be just one voice coming from the ground. Freedom ! Freedom ! Freedom ! The blood of Kashmiris is not the water of Jhelum.. ..that it doesn't hold any importance for the Indians. Today is the day when Maulvi died. It's possible that I might be murdered as well. But 'Jihad' will never end. We've been fighting this war for 18 years. And we'll keep fighting for years to come. 'Nara-e-Takbeer'. 'Allah-O-Akbar.' 'Nara-e-Takbeer'. 'Allah-O-Akbar.' History is the witness. 'Whenever the water at the Goddess's temple has turned black..' '..calamity has befallen Kashmir.' There has been so much destruction already, Goddess. What's left now? There's a message from 'Char Chinar'. Rainawari Chowk. These CRPF officials have troubled us a lot. Show me your ID. Where are you coming from? Where are you going? See that, sir, didn't I tell you? In our own house they ask us where we're going. Just answer me. Get that? Don't slap me, sir. - I shouldn't slap you. Come out. Then I'll shoot you. Shall I shoot you? - Yes, shoot me. Rather than getting beaten up everyday.. ..it's best that you kill me. You speak too much. You speak too much. Forget it, sir. - Just a minute. Don't interfere.. ..or else I'll shoot you both here. And show that you two were militants. What do we want? - Freedom ! What do we want? - Freedom ! Don't move anyone. Check everyone. The situation has become very tense.. ..because of this blast. The entire world's media.. ..have their eyes on Kashmir. Release a press note on our behalf.. ..that is from the ministry of Kashmir affairs. ''That we strongly detest this blast..'' ''..and the attack on Haji.'' ''And we assure the people..'' ''..that this time the elections will be peaceful.'' ''There isn't going to be any problem.'' ''And like every time, we'll make the government.'' The attack on PKF's leader, Haji Shah.. ..claimed the life of his party leader, Shabber Ali.. ..and his driver. Mr. Haji has requested the people of Kashmir.. ..not to stage any riots. A press conference has been called in PKF headquarters Sir, we've heard that your party leader.. ..Shabbeer Ahmed is dead. Who do you hold responsible? The enemies of Kashmir. Those who don't want Kashmir to be liberated. But, regretfully, I've lost another dear friend of mine today. Excuse me, sir. Dhruv Raina, Zee news. What.. what did you say your name was? Dhruv Raina, sir, from Zee news. Sir, 17 attacks in 18 years. And you escaped each one. Is it a coincidence or what? I mean, how would you explain this, sir? It's the grace of Allah. One more question, sir. When a leader like you can be attacked.. ..then how safe is Kashmir for the people, sir? I think you better ask the people that. How 7,00,000 Indian soldiers are protecting the people. And about the bomb blast. Let me ask you.. ..aren't there bomb blasts in Mumbai, Ahmedabad or Delhi? Sir, but terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Toiba stage them. It feels nice to see a Pundit reporter after many years. By the way, Mr. Raina. How long have you been reporting in Kashmir? Sir, for about six months. - Six months. Do you know him? He is a Pervez. He was six months old.. ..when he was locked up in jail with his mother. Your government didn't allow his mother to feed him. That means.. even a six-month-old boy is a terrorist.. But, sir.. - But what, Mr. Raina? For India, it's breaking news if Aishwarya Rai.. ..sees the moon or not. But many women here haven't seen their husbands for years together. Why doesn't the media tell the Indians about that, Mr. Raina? No, you tell me this. Hello. - Hello. What's wrong, why have you come here after so many years? I came here because I was missing you. You intelligence officers.. ..always think that the others are not so intelligent. That's why there's so much terror in the entire world. Every man comes here with a motive. I'm here on a mission. Kashmir is going to burn again. That's nothing new. That's been happening for the past 18 years. Something big is going to happen here. Bigger than '89. How can I help you? I want to know about the blast. Mahroof, open the door. Urgent message. Just a minute. Oh, God. Who attacked Haji? How do I know? Ask the one who did it? Didn't you provide the arms for the attack? Whose order was it? - I can't tell you. Rascal, if you can't tell me.. ..then you have no right to live. - Open the door. Mahroof, open the door. My job was to deliver the arms at Sabrina's house. I don't know anything other than that. Radio all check-post. A burqa-clad lady is fleeing towards market. Catch her. Quickly. Who are you? - Messiah. I just saved your life. Why did you kill Mahroof? - Why do to want to know? What is your name? - Gul Jehangir. Brother, food is ready. - Coming. The military killed his father. And the militants killed his brother. Yet he dreams of freedom. What do we want? Yelling or writing about liberated Kashmir.. ..doesn't get you freedom, sir. One needs to make sacrifices, like Shabeer has. Look, this time I want all the parties.. ..to unite under one sovereign. We'll have to fight together. Goodbye. Baba, Mahroof was a traitor.. ..and I don't need anyone's permission to kill a traitor. Dear, how many times have I told you.. ..to learn to control your anger. You shouldn't have gone there without Badi B's permission. You should've taken the Fatima Squad.. ..or Pervez along. She always loses her control in a fit of rage. I'm talking to her, Pervez. You don't need to interfere. But Baba.. - I've lost many dear ones on this mission. I don't want to lose you, dear. Become a great leader like your father. The police is there for other things. - y es, Baba. I'll keep that in mind the next time. Hello. - Hello. How's everything? - Everything's fine. We've found Sabrina's home. Mahroof had delivered the arsenal to that address. Prepare the Fatima Squad. We'll conduct the Friday prayers there. - y es. And find out who Gul Jehangir is. I've heard you stitch uniforms for the army. Look, mister. The army provides junk to the soldiers in the name of uniform. But if the soldiers want to spend their own money.. ..and get a better uniform stitched.. ..then why does anyone have any objections? If the military doesn't have any objections why will I? But the junk that the military sends to you.. ..you sell it to the militants. After all that's my business, sir. My bread and butter.. And these clothes. Who do you sell them to? The military or the militants? There are people like me in Kashmir.. ..other than the military and the militants. I had ten, still have three left Would you like to buy them? I will buy them. But first.. information. Who staged the blast? The militants or the military? This seems to be the work of some agency or.. ..someone from within? Not the military or the militants. How can you be so sure? Sir, this is Rainawari Chowk, no-man's land. Here's Jaish, this is Al-Baddar, and this is Hiz-ul-mujahideen.. None of these three will attack here, that's for sure. And, Lashkar. Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Greetings. Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Welcome Khan sir. Greetings. - Greetings. That's fine. Rauf is taking care of all the arrangements in India. You'll get anything you want. Have some tea. The general was asking, whether.. ..any specific date has been decided for the mission? By the grace of Allah, this time 'Diwali' (Festival of lights).. ..will come before 'Id' (Muslim festival). For the time being, ask the Kashmiri's.. ..not to indulge in any suspicious activities. I don't want any blunders. Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! He was trying to run. We traced him. Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! You shouldn't try to run, son. Come. Here comes Lashkar! India, you're doomed ! #The hope of achieving it was lost!# #But the happiness in our heart knew no bounds when we achieved it.# #Salutations to Life!# #We are together and may we always be together.# #Thats all we pray.# #May our love bloom in abundance.# #This we tell the LORD !# #The hope of achieving it was lost!# #The hope of achieving it was lost!# #But the happiness in our heart knew no bounds when we achieved it.# #Salutations to Life!# #Salutations to Life!# #Salutations to Life!# #Let us all live in brotherhood together.. # #.. in this orchard of ours!# #Our dream of peace shall stand true together.. # #.. in this orchard of ours!# #Salutations to Life!# Where is Sabrina? - I don't know The leader of Fatima Squad, Aziza Ansari.. ..exposed a shocking sex scandal in Srinagar today. The shocking piece of information is that the person.. ..behind this organised sex scandal, Sabrina Malik.. ..is linked with a well-known political family. Come, let's find out from these girls.. ..the reason, the helplessness behind this step. We're destined to be molested. Who do you hold responsible? Everyone's the culprit. The military.. they do it by holding their guns. - y es. And the leader, by promising us freedom. - y es. This new aspect of Kashmir really is shocking. Have the political parties, struggling for freedom.. ..resorted to prostitution and pandering? Mr. Haji, what's going on in the valleys in your presence? Such news of sex scandals.. ..are ruining the mission of Kashmir. Don't forget that you're given this fund.. ..for the liberation of Kashmir and 'Jihad'. We aren't involved in this. But you can control it. We don't want any activities until the elections. Unless authorized by us. Goodbye. Aziza, you've crossed all limits of insolence. Baba, I didn't know that they were running a brothel there. Why did you have to go there without my permission? Badi B, Mahroof had delivered the arsenal to someone there. Do you know, Kashmir is being defamed.. ..because of your actions? And what Sabrina is doing.. ..is it something to feel proud of? Kashmir is an international issue. The entire world watches every step of ours. And the ruination of innocent Kashmiri girls.. Aren't you worried about that? A wretch like Sabrina should be gunned down at Lal Chowk. Aziza. Learn to stay within your limits. Ask Pervez to arrange for her security. Who is it? - Gul Jehangir. Don't look back, two people are following you. Where are they? I don't see anyone. But I can.. you, as well as them. Keep walking. There's a butcher's shop on your left, go inside. Come out from the back door. Wait there. Now come out. Walk towards Dal Lake Come to cafe Murad. Who were those people following me? They were Pervez's men. - Impossible. If you don't believe me, they're lying right there. You can ask them when they regain consciousness. Who do you work for? I was jobless earlier. But these days I have a job. Protecting you. First, I saved you from the police.. ..and today from Pervez's men. What do you want? Where was Mr. Haji going on the day of the blast? Believe me, our motive is the same. From Jama Masjid to the Mosque. And after that, I don't know. Who was with him? - Shabeer Ali, Pervez.. ..and many other leaders. Anything else? Why are your eyes filled with so much rage? Every Kashmiri inherits it. One more thing. You're very beautiful, just like Kashmir. This is only the external beauty. If you look inside, you'll be scared. It's best that we stay away from each other. Goodbye. Kashmir hasn't changed at all. It's still heaven. Look, Mr. Rauf, you don't understand. Everything's going according to the plan. Except for you, Mr. Samar. Look, when we've already fixed a deal.. ..that you'll give the machinery, we'll execute it. Then why are there extra expenses? Look, please solve your internal problems yourself. Why are you loading it on us? We spend 30 crores every year on Lashkar.. Did we ever ask about that? Look, the ministry, police, forces, agencies.. ..everyone's involved in this. We'll have to fill everyone's pockets. So? Everyone's going to make profits after this mission. Do you know how much the budget.. ..of the goverment, ministry and intelligence will increase? Take a seat. Let me explain it to you. And look here. Look here. Military intelligence, 100 crores. Intelligence bureau, 100 crores. J&K, separate.. 300 crores. That means, your government.. ..is spending 500 crores on Kashmir every year. And that's been going on since the last 18 years. Give him the total. 9000 crores. Rs.9000 crore. And the budget for the agency.. that is unlimited. I'm talking about only Kashmir's budget. And what we're talking about right now.. ..is about the whole of India. Now you can calculate the profit.. ..that you'll make in the next 20 years. There is no God but Allah. And Prophet Mohammed is his messenger There is no God but Allah. And Prophet Mohammed is his messenger. Six.. Seven.. Aziza. - Eight. Why was Pervez spying on me? He wasn't spying on you, he was protecting you. I can protect myself. - It's Baba's orders. Who was he? Aziza, who did you just meet? - Jehangir. He saved me from the police.. ..when I killed Mahroof. Don't meet him again. That's an order. Yes. - Yes. How are you? - Fine. When did you return from India? - Two days ago. Delhi, Jaipur.. even went to Jodhpur. I had a look at all the jails. There's no record anywhere. More than 10,000 are missing. And there's no record of anyone. Whenever I come back.. ..every one looks at me with hope to know about their kin. And all I give them is sorrow and despair. Everything will be fine soon. Hello. - Hello. Aatif, the food-grains have arrived. The cement will arrive by evening. Zaaka, when will you finish building strong homes? Aatif, it'll take at least two months. I see. That means they haven't had enough of bullets and abuses.. ..that now you want them to die of cold. Finish it quickly. - Sure. Salman, have you fixed the radio yet? The radio is ready, Aatif. Everyone's waiting for you. Greetings. Greetings. You didn't go to school today? You've a holiday - Greetings. How are you? Fine? Fine. - Fine. How far have you arranged for Sakina's marriage? Son, you've made all the arrangements. We're only waiting for Ahmed to return. Aatif, we're ready.. Mother here talk with him. Greetings, son. Are you fine? Will you be attending Sakina's wedding? - I am, Mother. This is all I can take, Mother. The condition here is worse. There're no allies here, Mother. Come back, son. Everyone's waiting for you. They're waiting to come back. And we're waiting to return to our family. Sir, we should report him. No. He's not a terrorist. They're normal people who keenly went to Pakistan. And want to come back now. Three weeks more, I'll leave for my home as well. I'll be far away from this madness. Sir, do you get fits as well? - Yes. What else do you expect when the salary's only Rs.7000? Cook for yourself, stitch uniforms for yourself. And battle these foolish terrorists as well. It's called heaven. Heaven. Heaven. The difference between heaven and hell. Just one bullet. Excuse me, matches? - Get lost. Sir. - The saffron reached to budd-shah. Mother is returning from Delhi tomorrow. She'll be here. Deliver the goods. I'm sending the children for training. Be careful. You'll get your share when the goods are delivered. Rauf. Good morning. - Thanks for waiting. So, all well? - Fine. We need to open the border for three hours. - 30 lakhs. The rate's too high this time, Sir. This time you need more time as well. You're getting the border opened for three hours. How many people? - 30. Add five more to it. And send them in the end. The army has to achieve their target as well. How long do we have to struggle? How much longer do we have to fight.. ..to live respectfully in our own country? Sometimes I think.. ..freedom is only a dream. Aziza, you know, when I was young mother would say.. ..God tests his dear ones more than others. Who is Gul Jehangir? - Why? I don't know. Every time the elections come up, we get to see new faces. By the way, this time you'll get to see a known face. You know what the consequences can be. I already tried using the gun. Let's try using the ballot this time. The motive is still the same. Freedom. What if something happens to you? Then we'll meet in the other heaven. # My heart desires you..# # But I cannot be one with you..# # My heart passionately longs for you..# # But I cannot be one with you..# # I am the falling night you are the coming morning..# # Inspite of being together we still are apart..# # Beloved. Beloved.# # It is you alone who is bound in this chain of my cherished moments..# # It is you alone who has alwaysbeen in every interpretation of my dreams.# # I am the falling night you are the coming morning..# # Inspite of being together we still are apart..# # Beloved. Oh Beloved.# Yes. I want the Haji blast case file. The CIK has them. They won't give me the file.. ..without knowing the reason. And you know that is a risk for our mission. Who is the CIK chief? SP Khan, but he won't cooperate. In Kashmir, the system works differently, Vikram. That's the problem, sir. Damn-egos. The system sucks. Give us justice or give us death ! Give us justice or give us death ! Wait. Who do you want to see? I've an appointment. Yusuf Khan. Hello, sir, Yusuf Khan wants to see you. Okay, sir. Go in. Give us justice or give us death ! Give us justice or give us death ! Return our kin to us. Give us justice or give us death ! Give us justice or give us death ! Mr. Khan ! Mr. Khan ! Mr. Khan ! How many times have I told you.. ..that it's futile to come here, Parveena. The government is paying you a compensation. Rs.5 lakhs is not a small amount. Take the money and leave us alone. We don't want money. We want our husbands. Which Indian jail has him locked up? You've been to all the jails. You didn't find him there.. ..so what can I do about it? He must have gone across the border. The military abducted him, Mr. Khan. He was in your lock-up. In your lock-up. Mr. Khan. Listen, Mr. Khan. Look, I'll try to speed up the inquiry. - Inquiry? Mr. Khan, you've been inquiring for the past 17 years. Why don't you just say your government has killed them? At least, we won't have false hopes. As per our Islamic customs.. ..we'll get the rights of a widow. Get her out of here. Get her out of here. - Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan. At least, tell me where he has been buried. We'll perform his last rites. - Come with us. Mr. Khan. Who did you sell this jacket to? I have many customers. How can I tell you who I sold it to? Take your pick, what do you want? Did you plant the bomb? - I.. I didn't do anything. Even I'll say, ''I didn't do anything,'' after killing you. All I know is that.. ..we had to blast the car with the green flag. It was Pervez's orders. Greetings. - Greetings. Come to Amina temple.. ..if you want the name of Anwar's murderer. Who is speaking? - Goodbye. Who? Hello. y our job is done. I was looking for you. Thank you very much for this meeting. Rascal. Aren't there enough police here? Or, are you the police? Why don't you show yourself? You gave the orders for the blast, isn't it? Don't rack your brains.. ..or else I'll blast the entire building. Tell me, why did you stage a blast on Haji? Feroze. You'll be the target for my next bullet. Tell me, who are you planning to murder? Rascal ! We have to turn Kashmir into heaven. Aatif, you're taking the right step. My vote will be for you. - Thank you. Today our identity.. ..is nothing more than an I-card. We're supposedly living in heaven. But the truth is for the past 18 years.. ..we've been living in a beautiful jail. No freedom of speech.. ..or to think. No freedom to live as we want. Our children can't work outside. Because they're called militants. And they can't work here.. ..because there are no industries here. And there won't be any industries here.. ..as long as we have such selfish leaders.. ..who don't want the people to progress. Because evolving people ask questions. The world is constructing homes on the moon. And we have to think twice before stepping out of our home. We need to build same Kashmir.. ..in which our children grow up playing with toys and not guns. The Kashmir where children grow up with their parents.. ..and not in orphanages. I don't promise you heaven. But I will make honest efforts to.. ..get you out of this hell. Vote for Gulmohar in the coming elections. Say it aloud. - We're one. Say it aloud. - We're one. What do we want? - Freedom. What does freedom mean? - 'Allah-O-Akbar'. What do we want? - Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Freedom. Get the party of Gulmohar out of our way. Such people can be a threat to our mission. - y es. And.. the intelligence has their eyes on Pervez. I've asked him to go underground. And keep meeting Haji. Keep showing them dreams of freedom. You don't worry. Everything's going according to the plan. The goods are safe. And the training has commenced. By Allah's grace, this time we'll do what we couldn't in '89. Aatif Hussain gave a provoking speech.. ..in a political rally today. And instigated the feelings of the people. The police had to open fire to bring the crowd under control. And many people were injured. The Jammu & Kashmir police have arrested Aatif Hussain.. ..under section 153 A on non-bailable charges. There's already been a lot of blood-shed in Kashmir. And I don't want anymore because of me. Is this a pure political gimmick or something else? Only time will tell. Along with cameraman Khursheed.. ..this is Dhruv Raina, for Zee news, Srinagar. Why did you call me here? I want to tell you something about Baba. I don't want to hear anything. Not even his attacker's name? Pervez. Baba has raised Pervez like his child. It's impossible. I'm standing at the Makdoom saheb mosque. I won't lie. The reason for this special attachment with Baba? Not Baba, with Kashmir. Goodbye. Sir, your guest has arrived. Tell me how I've to treat it. Exactly like a criminal should be treated. Yes, Aziza, what do you want to say? Baba, I want to talk to you in private. No one's a stranger here, tell me. Your life is in danger. - There's nothing new about that. This time you're in danger from your kin, and not strangers. Say it clearly. Baba, Pervez.. staged that attack on you. - Aziza. Do you know who you're accusing? - Yes. Pervez gave the blast orders. You're crossing your limit, Aziza. You've been influenced by that rascal Aatif. Aatif didn't tell me anything. Then who told you all this? The same one who saved my life. I restrained you from meeting him. Why are you meeting strangers? Have you forgotten PKF's principles? Apologise to Badi B. I can't do that. Baba, you don't see the truth. No, Aziza, I can't pardon your mistakes.. ..calling it immaturity. It's best that you.. ..choose a different path like Aatif. I hope her honesty doesn't get her killed. #Bulla(sufi poet Bulleshah ) says you are nothing # #I too agree that I am nothing.# #Neither the country is mine..# #..nor does this soil belong to me.# #I am a wanderer in my very own land.# #Who am I?# #Who am I?# #Why am I a stranger in my own world?# #Who am I?# In the name of Islam. In the name of pundit. In the name of Kashmir's honour. In the name of freedom. Everyone is involved. ''There's already been a lot of bloodshed.'' ''Aatif is the messenger of God.'' Wasn't that your motto? You've killed many people, haven't you? I have, but not the innocent. Only scoundrels like you. That's why Haji threw you out of his party. 'I can't work with the Lashkar.' 'The Lashkar is an integral part of our mission.' 'I want to stop using the gun.' 'I hate it.' 'They're against Islam. - And you're against us.' 'It's a feeling of pride to sacrifice your life..' '..for the cause of freedom.' 'y ou all sell dreams of freedom.' 'y ou've turned Kashmir into a company.' Traitor. You're going against the very leaders you worked for. You'll bring liberation. Become the messiah of Kashmir. You want to be become more affluent than Haji. You betrayer. Why do you want to contest the elections? How much has Delhi offered you? How much have they offered you? You work for India but the Pakistanis pay you. You ruin the reputation of Kashmir at Lal Chowk.. Long live.. - Aatif Hussain. Long live.. - Aatif Hussain. Long live.. - Aatif Hussain. Thousands of people have taken to the streets.. ..to protest against the injustice done to Aatif Hussain. And the daughter of Maulvi Aziz Ansari.. ..and the leader of the Fatima Squad, Aziza Ansari herself.. ..has formed an alliance with the people.. ..to protest against the injustice. Aziza will talk to us. Aatif Hussain is fighting for Kashmir and the Kashmiris. That too, without any weapon. The crime he has been arrested for isn't true at all. I request every Kashmiri.. ..to speak for Aatif Hussain's release. Thank you so much. This is Dhruv Raina, with cameraman Khursheed, Zee News She's stubborn.. just like her father. What have these savages done to you? That's what they're paid to do. Anyway, I'm in much better state here compared to Kashmir. You can joke in this condition as well? Don't worry. Not just I, but entire Kashmir is with you this time. The media will support us for your release. Look, we've started a signature campaign. Aziza, do you know what can be the consequences.. ..of openly supporting me? Haji will throw you out of PKF. That will never happen. I've already left PKF. Aziza, the one who got me thrown in here.. ..is none other than Rauf. Look, I'm worried about you. You need protection. Go to Dardpura for a few days. Razaka and Salman will make all the arrangements. Can I do anything for you? - Pray. We'll have to arrest Pervez to know about operation 89. I nearly had him. According to me, Pervez staged the blast. I have a feeling, it has something.. ..to do with operation 89. Are you sure, Vikram? - Positive, sir. This is a part of a very big conspiracy. Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Come in. If you had informed me I would've come myself. Along with the Indian police. Do you know what's going on in Kashmir? An arrest warrant has been issued in your name. Stay here until the situation simmers down. - Yes. You can stay with us. Now we don't know how to be hospitable like the Kashmiris But we'll surely treat you as well as we can. Give him some kebabs. Here. - Thank you. You know, Pervez, after fighting the 'Jihad'.. ..with the Russians, we've made two strong allies. First is the American dollar. And the second is this AK 47. - Sir. Do you know why it's called an AK 47? Sir, I only know how to use it. AK means, 'Azad Kashmir' (Liberated Kashmir ). Since 1947. Now, whether you immerse it in water.. ..or keep it on ice, it never betrays you. - Sir. Like you Kashmiris. There have been 17 blast attempts on Baba. We don't know when the 18th will be. His life is in danger, and he'll never accept that. Uncle, we want to expose the attackers of Baba. What happened on the day of the blast? 'Haji Baba, Pervez and Shabbir came out of the mosque.' 'Like every Friday, Haji Baba stopped his car at the tomb.' 'He bought a green cloth from a hermit..' '..and I wonder why he asked for it to be tied on to Shabbir's car.' 'All I know is that I had to blast the car with the green flag.' Khan, Aatif is becoming famous amongst the masses. The longer you keep him in jail.. ..the better his image will be for the masses. They can doubt me as well. It's better to set him free. He can't harm us once he's out. But as long as he stays in the jail he'll be a threat to us. You better tell Rauf that. He got him arrested. Did you find out anything about Pervez's murderers? The informers are trying. We'll let you know as soon as we find out. Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Tell me what happened that day. That day Shabbir and Haji had a quarrel over some issue. Shabbir wanted to contest the elections.. ..and Haji accused him that Delhi had bribed him. Where were they all going on the day of the blast? They were on their way to the Peer's house.. ..to find a solution for the problem. But it's been ages since the Peer forsake politics. Why would he interfere? This is Kashmir. No one ever renounces politics here. Sometimes I feel as if I'm just a morning newspaper to you. Why don't you come to see me casually some times? You're the only one in Kashmir I can trust. I can call my friend. I was just joking. You understand the pain of Kashmir. You're my brother. Tell me, what is it? On the day of the blast.. ..Haji and Shabbir Ali were coming to see you. It was their personal matter. They were coming here to take advice. The issue was so grave.. ..that Haji murdered Shabbir Ali. Haji had staged the blast, isn't it? I don't believe it. They both belonged to the same party.. ..so what was the quarrel about? Being in the same party doesn't mean.. ..they think on the same level. They both had different intentions about the upcoming elections. Haji wanted to boycott the elections.. ..and Shabbir decided to contest the elections. For sure, whoever contests the elections.. ..has compromised with India. That means Delhi has bribed Shabbir Ali. This is Kashmir. This is a very big company. They make crores of rupees everyday so that this destruction continues.. Maybe, Shabbir fell prey to that as well. Who knows.. And Aatif? - He has to die. You have to arrest Haji, sir. Not possible, Vikram. Try to understand. If we arrest Haji it'll lead to exactly what happened in '89. The riots. And the obsession for freedom. Kashmir will burn again, Vikram. I don't understand you guys. No one arrests politicians. Only the innocent Kashmiris are the ones who get arrested. I don't work like that, sir. You have to arrest Haji. Vikram, we want Rauf and not Haji. He's the ISI agent. The link between Haji and Budd Shah. Then what's the big deal? Arrest him. - Can't do it. Diplomatic immunity. Do you understand that? Give this to uncle Rahim. For her daughter's marriage. And tell him that Budd Shah has sent it. For a loyal soldier. There's danger in Lolab valley. - I know. Goodbye. Keep misleading the government. So that they never find us. Peace in the valley can be a threat for us. - Okay. Stop. Stop. Maybe you don't realise.. ..if the media and masses find out about this.. ..it can lead to the downfall of the government. Government? You'll directly benefit.. ..from the terror which this mission will spread. No pain no gain. The more the people are scared.. ..it will keep adding to your ministry's budget. And I don't have to tell you.. ..that you're going to reap the maximum benefits in such deals. You'll have the biggest cut. So get as much as you can. I've decided to boycott the elections. And the price? - What would be the price for heaven? Any amount is less. Don't worry. y ou won't lose anything in this deal. Shall I have the money deposited in the trust? And you don't have to keep Aatif locked-up in the jail.. ..and make him a hero. Bail him out. Goodbye. We don't want passports. No one will cast their votes. Once again India has announced the elections. India has been asserting the elections on us.. ..just to show the world. But what good will that do? Human rights violation has been increasing every year. We won't endure the brutality of the Indian army. We won't tolerate it. We won't tolerate it. We don't want these bogus elections, but freedom. These people who are contesting the elections.. ..have been bought over by Delhi. Because they don't want Kashmir to be free. But I, Haji Sayyed Shah.. ..and true Kashmiris like you, won't let them succeed in their motive. And today.. by tearing this blue book.. ..I announce the boycott of elections. We don't want passports. No one will cast their votes. We don't want passports! No one will cast their votes. We don't want passports! No one will cast their votes. So, Mr. Haji, will the masses support you this time.. ..or will they support Aatif? Well, what do you think about the Kashmiri Pundits? Will the Kashmiri Pundits be able to vote this time? And yes, the masses are scared.. ..because of your election boycott. And they feel this will lead to Kashmir's destruction. What do you have to say about this? Think positive. And pray that we Kashmiris don't have to resort.. ..to doing what we did the last time. - y es. Think positive about Kashmir, Mr. Raina. - y es, yes. Kashmir wants freedom, that's decided. But will they choose the way Haji Sayyed Shah has shown them? There are still two thoughts about that. We don't want elections but freedom. Aatif is a leader who likes progress. He'll get us freedom and food. We've shed a lot of blood. Aatif is the messenger of God. ''Aatif is the messenger of God.'' According to our exit polls.. ..Kashmiris want change, but is Aatif Hussain that change. Only time will tell. Along with cameraman Khursheed.. ..this is Dhruv Raina for Zee News. Fix a meeting with Aatif. We'll have to form an alliance with Aatif Hussain.. ..to win the elections in Kashmir. Her husband. It's been 18 years. He isn't dead. Maybe. Did the army abduct him? Major Sharma. They said they'll let him go after a routine inquiry. There was no news for two days. And when I went there to inquire.. ..everyone.. all of them declined. They never abducted any Saiyed Loon. Allah has said, ''Have patience.'' I have a lot of patience. Greetings, Mr. Rauf. - Greetings. I wanted to talk to you about Aatif's bail. We shouldn't have such discussions on the phone. Come home. We'll discuss things there. Goodbye. Great. How did you think of me today? Aatif is in jail. And I've left PKF. Baba won't support me either. Look, you don't look nice when you're worried. So, what can I do with you? Why are you quiet? Who are you? What do you want? What was the motive behind Shabbir's murder? Why did you get Aatif jailed? What are you blabbering? Look, I'm a businessman. And I only do business. You're right. You only do business but of Kashmir. Spare.. spare me, please. Tell me, what's going to happen here? What's the plan, tell me. It's a plan to do something similar to what happened in '89. Tell me clearly. - Freedom. The world knows that. Tell us what you know. The Maulvi's death. Haji and Maulvi both wanted Kashmir's freedom. But Haji wanted the aide of Pakistanis.. ..and Maulvi wanted the aide of Kashmiris. Their means were different, but the motive was the same. They both wanted Kashmiris to come together. And that was possible only when there was a big incident. Like the Maulvi's death. But the army murdered father. Aziza, you respect Haji like a father. But the truth is.. Haji Sayyed Shah.. ..is your father's murderer. You can kill Haji if you want. But if you kill him.. ..he'll be accounted as a martyr by the Kashmiris. And his photo will be put up on every wall.. ..along with your father's photo. Aziza, you need to do something.. ..that'll make the Kashmiri's hate him for the rest of their lives. #O, Lord of the world.# #Descend on earth.# #Come and see for yourself.# #How hatred's growing here.# Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Say it aloud! Leave me! Leave me! We'll begin our mission from the Jammu camp. And three children amongst you all will be selected for it. You. You, son. And you will begin our mission. How are you feeling now? Better. Aziza, I have to go. Where? Jammu. I.. need to address the rally. In the camps of the Pundits. Aatif.. - Aziza, I'm going to do.. ..what hasn't been done in Kashmir for years. Haji. It's his speciality to use people for his benefit. Haji will die as well. Like Pervez and Shabbir Ali. Don't associate Shabbir with these traitors. He was a true soldier of mission Kashmir. Wrong? You're unnecessarily terming him as a hero. There are no angels in politics. Everyone has a price. Shabbir wasn't a traitor. He wanted to contest the elections.. ..to bring peace and progress in Kashmir. Anyway, let's forget this. You lied to me. - What are you saying? Shabbir Ali wasn't a traitor.. ..he was a true Kashmiri, and you knew that. Yet you didn't tell me that. Look, Vikram, I told you all I knew. I considered you my friend. I thought you're a loyalist of Kashmir. But you've sold your soul like the others. What do you want? Why did you kill Shabbir Ali? What is operation '89? I don't have any connection with operation '89. You do, you absolutely do. You and Haji as well. Maybe that's why Shabbir Ali was killed. What do you want? Freedom. Freedom. y es, I'm linked to operation '89. We're going to blast Jammu. Will you be able to stop it within 24 hours? You know the consequences of blasts in Jammu. Jammu will turn into another Kashmir.. - That's what we want! That's exactly what we want! We want a Kashmir in every corner of India. So that you can endure our pain as well. And understand what we've been experiencing for the past 18 years. You've gone mad. You've gone absolutely mad. Do you know the consequences? It can't be worse than what it is now. Don't forget that the ones you're going to kill.. ..are Kashmiris as well. And don't forget.. ..that you fought against the Pakistanis for them. In 1947. I'm going to stop the blast. You try to do the same if possible. I'm helpless, I can't do anything. Aatif, History is the witness. Only Delhi's desired candidates.. ..have won the elections in Kashmir. And that has been happening since 1947. This time history will change. The favoured candidate of the masses.. ..will win the elections in Kashmir this time. This is politics. How far do you think you can fight alone? Look, you need an ally who can get a national platform.. ..for this small regional problem. - Forget it. You know that you Indians have created this problem. And we've understood that you don't want to solve it.. ..but play political games. If you really want to solve this problem.. ..stay away from Kashmir. Operation '89 is happening as I'm talking to you, sir. Colonel Kapoor was right. This is bigger than '89. Vikram, give me all the details. They have four lakh soldiers, sir.. ..who have been trained in 'Azad' (Free) Kashmir. Other than that, they have millions of militants.. ..who are ready to attack. Their chief, Budd Shah.. We'll have to catch him, sir. They want to spread terror in every part of India.. ..like they have done in Kashmir. Don't be absurd. We can't take such a big decision on the basis of rumours. And anyway, the elections are so close. If we call off this rally the Kashmiris will find another topic. They'll turn this topic into an issue of freedom of speech.. ..and human rights and take it to the UN. But, sir.. - Don't get carried away. I'll talk to the concerned authority. We'll take care of the country. You take care of the border. Connect me to Char Chinnar. Char Chinnar. - Gul Jehangir. Your life is in danger. I know, but the mission is much more dangerous. Leave Kashmir. It's the GOC's orders. Abort operation '89 now. - Not possible. Jammu is under threat and we'll have to stop it now. Tell GOC that I need support and not advice. And we need to act fast, Major. - Sir. Your suspicion was right. Haji is funded by ISI. This has all the details. Give it to your friend. - Not required. She has left PKF. She doesn't have anything to do with Haji. For the last 1 7 years Haji has been depositing this money.. ..in the Maulvi's trust. Maybe Aziza doesn't know that. Kapoor was right, Major. Kashmir is the most dangerous place in the world. Anything's possible here. Once again the Pundit's are the targets here. You can imagine what the Kashmiris will experience. What's going to happen? There's going to be a blast in Aatif's rally. - What? Ask Aatif to stop the rally. But.. Do as I say. Call Aatif now. All lines in this route are busy. Please call after sometime. All lines in this route are busy. Please call after sometime. Today we're about to experience.. ..a historical event in the making. Once a militant, now a political ambassador for peace.. Aatif Hussain is here to address.. ..the Hindu camps of the Pundit community. The Pundits, who were once driven away 18 years ago.. ..for the struggle for freedom by the separatists. So why is it that one such leader.. ..is trying to bring the Hindu community back? Is it a pure political gimmick or a genuine reach out? Allah is very happy with you, child. He has chosen you for 'Jihad'. This is the key to your salvation. Aatif, cancel this rally. There's going to be a big blast here. Thousands of people will lose their lives. Look around and see the number of people present. Today is a very important day in the history of Kashmir. And you want me to leave all this. This caravan won't stop now. This is the stage. And these are the four entry points. One, two, three, four. We'll enter from gate no.3 after the speech starts. Javed will take care of the rest. As soon as the mission is completed.. ..you'll meet Media and you'll meet the captain. The success of this operation.. ..is the main motive of our mission. There shouldn't be any blunders. That's Budd Shah's orders. Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! Today I.. - Long live.. - Aatif Hussain ! I'm not here to make any political promises. I'm here to tell you about my heartfelt desire. A desire, which is the voice of every true Kashmiri. There is someone at the window. - Ok, sir. All of you.. come back. Come back. We can't forget the past. But believe me, we've all endured pain. The only difference is.. ..the militants terrorized you, the military terrorized us. You're living in these refugee camps.. ..leaving your grand manors behind. And we're living in a beautiful jail. Everyone together has turned Kashmir into a company.. ..for their own benefit. And only the common Kashmiris are at loss. Whether he's Hindu or Muslim. We had very minor disputes amongst ourselves. And they did their duty to add fuel to the fire. Because their benefit was in separating us. But it is our duty to solve these problems.. ..and reunite again, and it is also our responsibility. And if we don't take this step.. ..then Jammu will face the same consequences.. ..as Kashmir has been, for the last 18 years. Haji Sayyed Shah.. is the murderer of my father.. ..Maulvi Abbas Ansari. For the last 18 years.. ..he's been toying around with the reputation of Kashmir. Do you know what you're saying, Aziza? I have evidence. His bank records, which show.. ..crores of rupees being transferred to his account for years. ISI and many other agencies have been funding him for years. So that Kashmir keeps getting destroyed. So that they can keep misleading Kashmiris.. ..under the pretext of Islam, or in the name of 'Jihad'. Or under the pretext of Kashmir's honour.. ..or the freedom struggle. Haji Sayyed Shah's job is to toy around with our feelings! And he's very keen to tearing his passport, isn't he? He has passports of three countries. India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Haji Sayyed Shah has done what the government of India.. ..and Pakistan has been doing with us for so many years. Haji is a culprit of every mother.. ..who has lost his son. He's the culprit of every son who has lost his father. And he's the culprit of every woman.. ..whose husband is missing. This is not my personal war. Instead, it has become the issue of Kashmir's existence. Haji Sayyed Shah has deceived the people of Kashmir. He has deceived you. And it's your right to punish him. PKF's leader Haji sayyed shah was arrested from Srinagar today. An intense exchange of fire has been going on.. ..between the army and Lashkar. According to sources Budd Shah was killed in an encounter. Firing between armed forces and terrorists continue.. Two terrorists have been killed. 160 died in serial blasts in four places in India. Terror strikes Mumbai again.. Haji Sayyed Shah has been released on health grounds. In the name of Islam.. In the name of Pundits.. In the name of Kashmir's honour.. In the name of Freedom.. Everyone is involved.
