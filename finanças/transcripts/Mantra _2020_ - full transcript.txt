Taken by the cancer... That's now taking me. Fuck! 20 years I sat at home with her ghost. 20 years... pissed drunk on the sofa talking to her, apologizing for not taking her to the doctor sooner. 20 fucking years. How did you get it to stop?

I'm here with Samantha Murphy who called in the disturbance on Tuesday Samantha, tell us exactly what you heard. I-I was readin' when I heard the first scream. I thought it was kids. But the more I listened, the more I could tell that something was wrong. I never heard nothin' like it. Thanks, Samantha. Even the dogs stopped barking! They could sense it. It was the kind of scream that makes you think that you're the victim. You... can feel it. When the screams stop you wonder... just how in the world it is that you're still alive. Back to you Doug Thank you, Tina. In other news... Who is it? Tustin PD. Evan Kamber? Yes? Hi. I'm Detective Stevens. I'm investigating the murder of your brother Nathan. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? It's not really a good time. It'll only take a second. If you're uncomfortable out here we could talk inside? No! No, out here's fine. Okay. When was the last time you spoke with your brother? We had a falling out. Haven't spoken much in the last year. Weren't close? It's complicated. Ah. Family stuff, huh? Something like that. Do you know anyone who would want to do him harm? Uh, no, no. Listen, I got to get going, so if there's nothing else? Hmm. Of course. Thank you for your time, Mr. Kamber. If you do remember anything, don't hesitate to call. Hi. Do you have any time tonight? Well, you're very, very fortunate! Yes, you're lucky. Okay, okay, listen, okay, I am running very late this morning. It's my fault. Figured. Yes, your fault, and so I'm thinking to myself today's the day I get fired. It's gonna happen today... And I finally get there and I'm praying he hasn't seen me yet. Did he? Wait for it. So the minute I walk in the door he calls me into his office, and I am rolling through the 50 excuses I came up with on the way over. Right, of course. Um, I was gonna go with... bed bugs. Bed bugs. Fell in the shower. Right. Yeah. And he tells me that he is very impressed at how I closed the Fisher account, and he wants me to help him run the region. Congratulations! So proud of you, babe.

Listen, I didn't call, I don't have an appointment, I don't know if you're busy but... Evan. Breakfast? Mr. Kamber? It's Detective Stevens He stepped out, Detective. Thank you, ma'am. Are you a friend of Evan's? I am. He's lovely. Would you let him know I stopped by? Of course. I hope you can help him Help him? He's troubled. I think he's having problems with a man named Nathan. He yells at him all night long, and this has been going on for a couple of days I see. Thank you for your time. You're welcome. Come back anytime. So what's happening, Evan? Fuck me, where do I start? Start anywhere. Okay. Four days ago my brother was murdered. Murdered. Four days ago, by some psycho in an empty house. I'm sorry. Do you have a brother? No. Well? "Well" what, Evan? I don't know, man, aren't you supposed to ask me something? Like, "were you close?" Were you close? Why don't you tell me? Huh? Why don't you tell me if we were fucking close, huh? You're the shrink. Of course we were close! Of course you were close. That's why I didn't ask Maybe you want to switch seats, huh? This was a mistake. When I first went to therapy, I froze up. Couldn't say a word... I just stared at my fingers for 45 minutes. You're already way ahead of me. Yesterday you said you want to talk, so... How about you cut the shit? Sit down, let's talk. What was his name? Nathan. Nathan. Have you spoken to anyone else about this, maybe your girlfriend or... I don't have a girlfriend What about your parents? They must be taking this pretty hard. You know, they're not feeling much of anything these days. What happened to your parents? They're gone. I'm sorry to hear that. When was this? About a year ago In that year what was the relationship like between you and Nathan? There wasn't a relationship. Yeah, it's okay "It's okay, it's okay, it's okay"... What is that, Shrink 101, huh? How is it okay? It's not. How you feel is okay. You want to know what I fucking feel, man? Yeah. I feel guilt. You can see him, can't you? Yes! Evan I want you to listen to my voice. You are hallucinating. He is not here, I do not see him. But I do! Everywhere! Evan, breathe. Relax. Breathe... Breathe, Evan. It's okay. You can open your eyes. Evan, I want you to tell me more about these hallucinations. It starts as a feeling. And then the smell comes. What smell? Blood. So much blood. And then I see him. I just wanted to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Evan... Evan... Evan! There is a treatment. I need it. It's experimental, I can't promise results, but I've had success in the past. I would try anything. Anything! Meet me here tomorrow morning. Get some sleep tonight. And don't eat anything. Lots of water though. Okay, so what's the treatment? Don't worry, I'll explain everything in the morning. Okay. Evan, before you go, one more thing. Let me give you some tea, and if you start to smell blood or anything tonight, burn this. What's in it? Some sweet grass, lavender, nothing psychoactive. It's just a blend I give my patients to help them relax. I also recommend a long bath I don't take baths. It's clean as a whistle. Not even a parking ticket. Something's going on there man. The neighbors just told me he was screaming Nathan's name all through the night His brother just died, bro. We need to look into this. You're coming with me to tail him tomorrow. No way, man, I'm not gonna spend a Friday in a hot car with your ass. Nope! Yes, you will. No, I'm not. Oh, yes, you will... or I'll tell your wife about that redhead in the coffee shop Are you blackmailing me, partner? Yep. Okay. A manhunt continues for the murderer of 27 year old Nathan Kamber of Santa Ana. Nathan was discovered mutilated in the bedroom of a Tustin foreclosure late Tuesday night. His brother Evan Kamber is live at the scene. Evan? Look up, Evan. Look up, Evan! Evan, Evan, Evan! Ha-ha! Leave me alone! ...who called in the disturbance on Tuesday. Samantha, tell us exactly what you heard. I was reading when I heard the first scream. I thought it was kids. But the more I listened, the more I could tell that somethin' was wrong. Jesus fucking Christ, Diane! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry. This is fucking teak. I got this in fucking Malaysia. Can you try to be more careful with my shit? Baby, I'm sorry. It's just, I have some things that are very important to me. What do we say about them? What did we say? Don't touch them. Don't damage them. That's right. I am sorry, I overreacted. And I can't wait to taste your fantastic cooking. Could you clean up the wine, please? Honey? You okay? Fine. What the fuck?! Jesus Chr... Jesus fucking Christ! No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No, no, no, no! No, stop, no, no, no! No! Evan... All of this just to prove me wrong? This is our job, Mendoza. My checks clear too, buddy. You know, I wish I knew you back when you cared about doing police work. I care! You care about that sandwich. Look, I just know a dead end when I see one. Okay, say I'm right... You're not. And we drive back, we file this as a cold case. And two months later, another similar body turns up. Another kid. Tell me you wouldn't be kicking yourself. Look, man, sometimes things just line up, you get a hunch, and facts just start... connecting in front of you. You do some research and make connections. And you make a satisfying arrest. And your name in the papers and... all your buddy friends shaking your hand, and you finally get to get some fucking sleep at night. And you don't think this is one of those times? Sorry. Then yes. Yes what? All this to prove you wrong. Fuck! Here comes your dead end now. What the...? Welcome, Evan. Jesus. Can you see what building that is? Uh, it's a shrink's office. Dr. Warren Atherton. I'll alert the press. Gibson, I need a background check. Warren? I don't believe in any of this. You don't have to. Okay, thanks. Shrink's clean. Surprise, surprise. Where you going? Lunch. What is this? What, shrooms or something? Ugh! This smells awful. It's different. Drink. Drink it all. It's disgusting! Ugh! So what now? Patience. What? Uh... I don't feel... It's okay, Evan. Evan, it's okay, it's okay. Breathe, Evan. Breathe. Evan? Evan, it's okay. It's okay... hey? Surrender. Hello. Evan. Do you know why we're here? I don't know where we are. That wasn't the question! Nathan? Hello, Evan. Stay. Why am I here? Nathan, you got to tell me what happened man! What happened? Tell me why I'm here. I don't even know where we are! Tell me. Tell him, Evan! Tell him what? I don't know anything! Tell me! I don't know! Tell him, Evan! Tell him! I don't know! I can't. I need help. Aww. Well, I am here to help. How much do you remember about that night? How much do you really... remember? No. No! Oh, Evan! We need to be honest about who you are. About... what you are. I didn't. It's not true. I couldn't have done it. Oh, Evan. Just... just... say it. Say it... say it... No. Oop! Please! Come on, Evan! You know you love it! Stop! Oh, Evan... let it out, Evan! You gotta let it out! I know this is hard for you. But I'm here to help. Tell me what you are. I... Am... Am... I'm a killer. "I am a killer." I'm a killer. "I'm a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. "I am a killer." I am a killer. I am a killer. I think you're ready. No, no! Evan? Hey! No! Nathan! Let me go! Warren! Let me go! Evan! Hey! Evan! How long was I out? Most of the day. Was it real? Was it real to you? What did you learn? I am a killer. What do you mean by that? I killed Nathan. Jesus Christ! Evan... This medicine isn't an exact science. If the dosage is off or the conditions aren't right it can project general manifestations of your emotions, but... It's just shades of truth, man, you can't take it too literally. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You hungry? My wife Diane is cooking dinner. And if I do say so myself, she is an exquisite chef. We're talking traditional Punjabi fare. How about a hot meal? Is that a yes? I can't really tell. All right. You, uh... You want to go like that? Hey. Hey! Eight hours. Who sees a therapist for eight hours? Well, maybe he's got a lot of problems. Like his brother was murdered or somethin'. Please don't tell me we're gonna keep tailing him? My ass hurts. I think you would have built up a tolerance by now. Oh, yeah. Evan, this is my lovely wife Diane. Nice to meet you Diane, it smells divine. Thank you. I hope you like it. I'm sure I will. Have a seat. I hope you like aloo gobi. I've never had it. Really? You spent any time in India? No, I've never left California. Oh, man, you're missing out. I learned quite a bit in India. Diane, you've outdone yourself. Yeah, Diane, I think that was the best meal I've ever had. I'm happy. If you'll excuse me. Don't do anything crazy while I'm gone. Go. Excuse me? You have to go. What? You're so young, so free. You have to go. You have to go. You can't stay, can't stay. Frog must jump, must jump... Frog must kick legs, kick legs, churn butter, churn butter, milk boils... Are you okay? Frog jump before his brain is braised and bloody and then it's chop, chop, chop! Jump, little froggy, jump! Jump! Jump! Baby, baby, baby. Diane. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Why don't you take a drink? Have a drink, please. Have a drink. You feel better? I am happy. Evan... Would you join me, please? I'm so sorry you had to hear all that. No, it's fine. It's just... What happened? When I first returned from India, I started volunteering at a homeless shelter. Diane was working there too, in the soup kitchen. I know it sounds corny but... when we first shook hands it was electric. I never felt anything like that. Not in school, not in India. Ever. One year later we were married. And everything was magic. She was out... when the phone rang. It was her mother. Calling to tell us that her sister Heather had fallen down the stairs and was on life support. Diane held her hand while they pulled the plug. I lost my Diane that day. Warren, I'm sorry. Over the next few months, her symptoms looked a lot like yours. I'm trying, Evan. Hey, man... Look, I haven't really felt like myself lately, but tonight was great. Thank you. I want you to come by my office tomorrow. Late afternoon. Sure. Good night. Good night. What was that all about? Huh? All right, I'm gonna go talk to the shrink. Can I trust you to put your phone down and stay on Evan? Fine. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. I just... No, no, no. It's okay. Dr. Warren Atherton? Go inside, sweetheart. Hi. I'm Warren. Who are you? Detective Ryan Stevens, Tustin PD. How can I help you, Detective? I'm investigating the murder of Nathan Kamber. It's come to our attention that you've been seeing his brother Evan Kamber as a patient? Oh, Detective, you're not here to try to convince me to break doctor-patient confidentiality, are you? No, no. Of course not. Just have a couple of routine questions for you, that's all. Well, fire away, Detective. But I have to tell you I can't say much. How long has Evan Kamber been a patient of yours? I'm afraid I can't say. Best guess. Oh, I know exactly how long. I just can't tell you Okay. Well, in that time have you noticed any changes in behavior or mood? Again, I'm afraid I can't say. Okay, let's try a more direct approach. Did Evan Kamber murder his brother? I'm confused about what you don't understand about doctor-patient confidentiality. That confidentiality ends when a serious crime has been committed. Is my patient under arrest? Not at the moment. But you and I both know that he's involved. Do I? Yes, I think you do. So let's quit playing games, shall we? So you think that just because someone is troubled that they're capable of murder. So, he is troubled then. Oh, we're all troubled Detective. I'm sure that if we dug into your head we'd find ourselves a trouble or two. Tell me, is bringing a patient home with you considered standard practice? Well, I care deeply for my patients, Detective. I think sometimes it helps to remind them what a healthy living environment looks like. And how healthy do you think the living environment is behind the doors of a cell? I beg your pardon? Because if you hindered my investigation in any way, I'll personally see that you are named an accessory. Well, thank you for stopping by, Detective. Don't hesitate to call if you're ever... troubled. Shit. Come on, Evan. Shit. What do you got? I'm not sure. This kid's messed up, man. He got in the car, he's at King's Cup on Third. Now he's just standing outside freaking out. Well, if he moves stay on him. Do I have to? Man, this place has a killer IPA. Stay on him, Mendoza. What are you gonna do? Shake the tree, to see what falls. Good evening, Miss Patel. Detective Stevens. Sorry to bother you so late. No, no! Come on inside Thanks. Thanks. Are you here because you have a suspect? No, not officially. But I do have a couple more questions for you, if you don't mind. Sure, whatever I can do. How close are you to Evan Kamber? Evan? Why? Just following up on some leads. You can't possibly think he has anything to do with this? We're exploring this from all angles. He has nothing to do with what happened to Nathan! I'll be honest with you, Miss Patel... His behavior has been strange. What do you mean? He's volatile, emotional, and the neighbors complain that he screams Nathan's name all through the night. He's traumatized! If that's criteria for a suspect then I should be at the top of your list! What are you gonna do? Put me in handcuffs? Of course not. Then leave Evan alone. Look, I know he's struggling, but he's getting help. Right. You mean Dr. Warren Atherton. Frankly, I don't trust him either. Look, Myra, I want to find whoever killed Nathan and bring them to justice. And I know you want that too. More than anything. Thank you for coming, Detective. You know, we pulled Nathan's phone records. Did you know Evan was the last person he talked to before he died? That's not possible. They haven't spoken to each other in at least a year, not since... Their parents died? Yeah, Evan told me the same thing. Why would he lie? Honestly? I think he's hiding something. From you, from me, maybe even from himself. Hi, can I help you? Dr. Atherton? Yes? I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Myra Patel. Okay, I... I don't really have any time right now, sorry. It's about Evan Kamber. Miss Patel, you should know that I can't discuss my clients. Nathan was my boyfriend. I see. Yeah, why don't you come in? Thank you. Please have a seat. Thanks. Tea? Oh, yes, please. Sure. So tell me, Miss Patel... Myra. Myra... How can I help you? Well... Evan's like family, the only family I have, really, and I know he would never do anything to hurt anyone, but... Last night a detective came over and he told me some things, which made me think... Maybe I don't know him as well as I thought I did. A Detective Stevens? Mm-hmm. Yeah, he visited me as well. This is great. Thank you Sure. Stevens is connecting dots that just don't exist. Evan's a good kid. So you don't think Evan has anything to do with Nathan's death? God no. He loved his brother I'd actually like to hear more about what you just said. What I said? About being alone. I didn't say that. "Evan's my only family." Now he barely talks to me. I mean, we used to be inseparable and... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, um... Myra, this is what I do. Please continue. Everything's falling apart. Nathan was my whole world, and with Stevens asking all these questions about Evan, I'm just scared I'm gonna lose him too. Thank you for being open with me. Do you really think you can help him? I think maybe I can help you both. Diane? Shit. Baby? You home? Diane? Are you home? Babe? Baby, baby, baby! Baby, look. Drop the knife. Please drop the knife. Diane! Drop the knife! It's okay. Jes... Diane! Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Breathe, breathe, breathe. I'm so sorry! It's okay I'm so sorry! It's okay. I don't know what's happening. I have you. I'm broken. I have you. Do you remember Joshua Tree? You woke up early when you heard the coyotes and you got scared. We walked outside to watch the sun rise. That's right. And I told you I would never let anything happen to you. And you asked me to marry you. Yes. And you made me the happiest man. Even now? Nothing has changed. I love you. I love you. I need a drink. Stevens, check it out. Redhead. And if you tell my wife, I kill you. You need to get out more, man. You need to live a little. Come on, let's go get a drink. Thanks man, but I think I'm just gonna retrace my steps. There's something I'm missing. I just know it. All right, well, suit yourself. All right, but I'm telling you, this is a dead end. Afternoon. Thanks. Let's take a ride. Why did you bring me here? Evan, you gotta take this head-on. You gotta take control. What kind of hippie fucking brain games are you playing, man? Warren that... that is my nightmare. You're asking me to go into my nightmare. Do you realize that? Yeah. No. Oh, I'm sorry, I can't. Evan... You need to do this. Why? Because of some fucking book you read? Because of some temple that you went to because... Because you didn't kill your brother. You need to go inside. You need to see for yourself how foreign this place looks to you. You don't have any memories here. Or just go on living with your brother's ghost. And what if you're wrong? At least you'll know. Fuck it. How we gonna get in? See? It's kismet. Evan... I know this is difficult, but... Is it familiar? Evan? Anything? No, there's nothing... But still... The vision. Yeah. It's... so real. We need to go deeper. What do you mean? Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Evan, you need this. You need to know you didn't do this I did do it! That's what that shit showed me! I am not going through that, Warren, again, I can't, I just... There's got to be another way... Hypnotherapy, pills, something! Okay, Evan, you want to try something else, we can. We can spend years in hypnotherapy. I can dope you up on every pill, patch, and injection I have access to. And maybe, maybe, we can catch a glimpse at the source of your illness, While you try to sleep at night with your wraith of a brother whispering in your tortured ears but this... Right here, right now... May be your only chance to get what you need. And what do I need? Deliverance. You're out of your fucking mind, man! Yeah... pot and kettle, huh? I'll be right here. Nothing will harm you. Evan, Evan? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Surrender. Surrender, surrender... Say it! Say it! I am the killer. Yes! Yes, you are. You are! Here you are again... Where it all happened. Now you are free. Share your gifts with the world. Oh, Evan, you... Are a killer. I am a killer. You are a killer I am a killer You are a killer. I am a killer. You are a killer. I am a killer You are a killer. I am a killer. You are a killer. I am a killer. You are a killer. I am a killer. You are a killer. I am a killer. You know what to do. Work your magic. Evan. No! Good night, Carl. Good night. All righty, sir, can I get you one more? I don't know... Are we gonna just sit here in silence for another hour, are you gonna talk to me? Stout. Okie-doke. Nathan, for fuck's sake, talk to me. Okay... I'll talk. You're an asshole. You're a selfish, selfish prick. Evan... It's been... what? A year since Mom and Dad died? What the hell happened to you, man? It's not that simple. What, you think you were the only one hurting? I had to identify the bodies! I had to tell our families! I had to make all of the arrangements, and I had to do all of it alone! Enjoy. You didn't even come to the funeral. Nothing? Nothing. Like I said, you're an asshole Asshole? I'm an asshole? I was an alcoholic dangling by a thread! Oh, here we go. Where were you? Don't put that shit on me, Nathan. Where were you? My own fucking brother abandoned me when things got just a little tough! A little tough? Nathan you were off the rails! What the hell was I supposed do? You were supposed to help me! I tried! How many times did I bail you out of jail or drag you out of a gutter? How many times did you binge and swear it was never gonna happen again? I would a done it for you. Well, I couldn't do it anymore! I wasn't helping you anymore, I was enabling you, and you were never gonna get clean knowing that I'd just... be around to pick up the pieces. Well, guess what... I got clean. For you. I got clean. And you never showed up. What the hell are you talking about? We were supposed to meet here that night. I called you. Told you that I was sober and that I wanted to apologize. You never showed up. Hey, guys, it's Evan, leave a message, I'll call you back. Give me a beer. Sure. Nathan? It wasn't my fault. Nathan, what did you do Are you fucking... Evan, I... I can't believe this. A year! A year I've spent talking to the police, trying to figure out what the hell happened! I tried to tell you! To tell me what?! That alcohol made you do it?! You're gonna play that excuse again?! Well, fuck you! You didn't show up! If you had, I wouldn't have gotten drunk and they'd still be alive! Bullshit! Bullshit! Your fucking mistakes! Your fucking problems! It should have been you that died! Well, I did... apparently. The question is... Did you kill me? What? Evan... How much do you remember about that night? I-I... I don't... How much do you really remember Don't you see? Go ahead... Drink your beer. I am a killer! No. I am a killer! No, no, no Come on, Evan! You would never do this to me even with everything we've been through. You're my brother. You love me. It makes no sense. Nathan? Nathan, I'm so sorry, man! I'm so sorry, Nathan! Alright, alright, get off me, dipshit. Now, let's go back to where it all started. What did you miss? Enjoy. What about him? Does he look familiar What about Myra? Don't you dare bring her into this! Does she fucking know about this, have you told her about this? She has nothing to do with this! She has a lot to do with this! Of course she does! She has nothing to do with it and you know it! Keep this between us. Right. It has nothing to do with her! It has everything to do her! How dare you, Evan! Ev... Evan? Evan! Hey, somebody help us! Please! Evan! Evan, wake up! What the fuck? Warren? Sleep... tight. Son of a bitch! What else, Evan? What? Who else? When you go, boy, go all the way! I'm here with Samantha Murphy. It was the kind of scream that makes you think that you're the victim. Evan, Evan, it's... Eh, it's a little far-fetched, don't you think? He killed your parents? That's enough to drive anyone over the edge. Whoo! Besides, you really think a small town shrink like me would be able to pull off everything your brother... Everything your victim over here is describing? Evan, don't listen to him. Come on. I don't know, I don't know. You're smarter than this. I don't know, it's possible... No, Evan! It is not. Your values and virtue are trying to trick you by conjuring up these fairy tales You're scared of what you are, but, Evan... You are beautiful. You're a virtuoso. You are a killer. That kind of talent is God given. Just think of all the masterpieces we can compose together if you just tell me what you are! Say it! Say it! Evan, look at me. I am a killer Ah, that's the truth! No, Evan, that's crazy! Stay out of this! You're already dead! And you killed him! Now say it again! I am a killer, I am a killer. "I am a killer, I am a killer." I am a killer, I am a... "I am a killer." No. Evan. I didn't kill my brother, and you... you're a liar. Evan, you... Yes, Doctor... I would like to switch seats. I'm sorry, Warren, but you're not in control anymore. Evan! Evan! You will never control me again! Evan! Oh, sh... Sh... Warren! Warren?! Warren! David 24, Station 7. Detective Stevens, come in. Station 7 to all units. Reports of an officer down. Repeat, David 24 reported down at this time, 1020, EMS is en route, code 3. Any available units also respond to code. No description of the DP at this time. Can I help you? Where's Warren? I'm sorry? Warren Atherton. I've been seeing him for the last five days, where is he? Warren?! I-I've... I've been on sabbatical for the past two weeks. Uh, are you hurt? Can I call somebody? What? Son... I'm Dr. Warren Atherton. David 19, confirming your 10-6 on the suspect. Yeah, I need backup at 729 East Unalome. Where's Warren?! Okay, calm down and maybe I can help. No, you can't help me. I need Warren Atherton! Where is he? Listen to me, I am Warren Atherton Okay! Where is Warren? I already told you! I am Warren! No! No, you're not! This is Warren Atherton! Yeah... It's impossible... He was helping me! Showing me what I am. And what are you? Say it! Say it! Say it. I am a killer. I am a killer, I am a killer, I am a killer, I am a killer. Where is Evan? Don't worry about Evan. He's got some things to do... but he'll find us. Or we'll come back for him. He's a resilient one, but he's family now. Chop, chop, chop, chop. What's that, babe? I want to see Heather. You can't see Heather anymore, sweetheart. Maybe you'd feel better if you had a drink. Drink please.. That's good. Feel better? I am happy. I am happy. I am happy. I am happy. I am happy. I am happy. I am happy. I am useless. I am blessed. I am blessed. I am trash, I am trash. I am useless. I am useless. I am useless. I am alone, I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone. I am alone.
