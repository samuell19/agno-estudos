7 DAYS DAY 1 - Chiara? - Yes. Hi. - You must be Ivan. - You speak French? - A little. Have you been running? - I got lost walking. This part of the island is very wild. - May I? - Thanks. The guesthouse is up there. It's the island's only hotel. You arrived yesterday? I think we've come for nothing. It's not doable. - Why not? - You'll see. The hotel's depressing for a start. So, what did I tell you? Look at it. This is a part we no longer use. But we'll clean it all up. We'll even put flowers. All right? Have a little patience. There are only 26 of us left on the island. All the young people left. - Is Saturday doable? - Yes. My son's preparing a room. Come and have a look at it. Luigi! Luigi! - Yes, Mamma? - The bathrooms? Yes, yes. I need some time. - Is the room ready? - I still have to do the bed. Hey, Nico! So, this is how we'll do all the rooms. Do you like it? Yes. - Does the lighthouse work? - It hasn't worked in years. Maybe it could be fixed? This place is a wreck. Let's go to Gertrud's. You'll love it. My brother wants to sleep here. Here or nowhere. So, is it possible to get... a mattress here or not? Is it possible or not? Come on, let's go. He's not answering. These people get on my nerves. - Genetic isolation never did any good. - Arsehole! - Excuse me? - Offending them isn't going to help. It doesn't matter. We won't manage it. It's impossible. We must be realistic. But it's for your brother. And my best friend. We must make it happen. It's the only place on the island with Internet. I managed to get the keys. Well. - We must tell them it's not working. - No! So when will we tell them? Don't worry them. It's still fragile. They've only been clean three years. Three years? Three years is an eternity. They've dreamt of it for so long. Having a normal life, showing everyone. So? How's it going? - Have you been to the doctor? - Yes, we got X-rays, no need to operate. - It's better. It'll be fine. - So, how's it going? Still lots to do, but we'll manage. You're an angel! I'll never forget what you're doing for us. Bro, Capo Grosso, is it doable? It's no sure thing. Even if it won't be what you dreamt of. - Figure it out. - What are we doing about the drinks? Are all your guests from your group? Most of them. Wine and champagne for the others, but just Coke and fruit juice for us. - You'll drink nothing at your wedding? - You want us to end up under the table? Be careful with the cake. They often put booze in them. - You want them to change the recipe? - No alcohol, get it? I'll take care of it, don't worry. How about you, Chicca? How are you? Are you nervous? I'm incredibly excited. I can't wait. I believe you. We'll talk tomorrow then. - Bye. - Bye. Here's my suggestion. - You do the rooms. I do the lighthouse. - Okay, I agree. - That's it, guys. Do you like it? - It's perfect. I'm pleased. Excuse me. We haven't spoken about the money yet. - You'll be guests. Didn't Luigi tell you? - Yes, yes... But for the rehearsals and the ceremony. They've all come here just for that. 50 euros per person. I think that should be okay. - We'll let you know tomorrow. - Okay, see you. - See you. Thank you. - Are you hungry? Shall we eat? - I should finish here. - Is it the wedding dress? - Yes. - You're a seamstress? - Costume designer. - Sorry. I work in the theatre. It's my passion. I haven't been to the theatre in ages. - What do you do? - I'm a botanist. I work at the University of Grenoble. Do you have a favourite fabric? Do you have a favourite plant? My favourite, I don't know... Thanks. - Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. Hi, what's your name? - Nico. - I'm Chiara. Nice to meet you. White wine or red wine? Red. Thanks. Sorry, I don't want to hurt you, but why were you so aggressive towards your brother just then? I don't know. They annoy me. They want too much. But you wanted to come here. - Thanks. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Francesca calls and says my brother can't move anymore. I had no choice. I've never done much for him. - But he annoys you. - It's the obsessions that annoy me. He went to a wedding here ages ago and now he wants the same thing. He wants to sleep at the lighthouse, at Capo Grosso. I don't even know why. He's always been like that, obsessed, a dreamer, unrealistic. He didn't tell you about his experience at the lighthouse? 15 years ago, he looked out to sea and suddenly decided to stop heroin. He decided he wanted to live. He did start using again. Still, that's the memory he holds on to. You know him better than I do. We live in the same neighbourhood. We see each other often. Want to kill me? This is nice music. Do you know it? - What is it? - Lhasa. L-H-A-S-A. DAY 2 I'M AT THE LIGHTHOUSE. BACK THIS EVENING. IVAN - Sleep well? - Yes. - Are you married? - No. How come? A beautiful girl like you! - Are you looking for a wife for your son? - I wish! The little one or the big one? - Ah, so he's your son too? - Yes! I had him a little late though. Well, when you're ready, we'll go to look at the rooms. HOW IS IT GOING WITH THE PREPARATIONS? WILL YOU CALL ME BACK? EVERYTHING'S FINE. LOTS TO DO. I'LL CALL YOU LATER WHEN I HAVE TIME. Chiara! What are you doing here? - Is that the lighthouse lamp? - Not sure I can fix it. It won't be easy. You've worked hard. Ivan, what have you done to your hands? I like you. I want to eat in the room with you. Buy something here and go up to the room. Okay? Excuse me. Can we buy something? - Is she not hearing on purpose or what? - Let's go to the restaurant then. No, no. It's not the same. It's better in the room. I can't. - Hi. How's it going? - Fine. Have you read it? Not bad. But are all the diagrams necessary? I know you love them, but they're too prominent. - Is that all? - Gabrielle insists we publish more, or she won't get funding. I know, I know. Is there anything I can do for you? No, nothing. - Will you manage it? - You'll get it tomorrow night, okay? DAY 3 - Morning! Did you sleep here? - Sorry, I worked until late. Take it easy. Take it easy. - Ah, got it! - Great! And now the bulb! Come, I'll show you what I still have. Mostly salami, pickled vegetables, pears in syrup, gherkins. I'll take the lot. - Have you decided to tidy up? - No need, darling. It's as tidy as can be. - You have any cheese? - Some pecorino, three wheels maybe. - Here's the bulb. - Thanks. Wait, wait. Take these. Wait! Take this too. Thanks. Give me that. I said give me that! Antonio, give me that! Give me that! - Give me that! - Give that back! For you to buy cigarettes? Forget it! That's my money! You rotten witch! - Are there mermaids here too? - Nobody's seen any yet. But you can hear them. Now I'm too old. I can't hear them. But in the past... We're here. - We know where it is now, that's enough. - You don't want a tour? We'll do it on Sunday with the others. - As you wish. I'll show you something near here. On the seabed. It's worth it. - How many are there? - Three. You cheated! I'm scared of losing control of myself, like yesterday at the shop. If you want, we'll end it when the others arrive. We'll enjoy it for three days and then it's over. We'll save ourselves all the crap that comes later. - What do you think? - I don't know. Well, I do. I want to keep the memory of your face, as it is now. Wait. You're suggesting we end it in three days and then never see each other again? Yes. Why not? You'll be capable of doing that? Actually, it's time that kills love. Don't you agree? So, we'll end it forever? Yes, in full flight. Okay. We'll do that. It's brave. Come in, you're just in time. It's a tradition here, fried blood. It gives us strength for the work ahead. And there's a lot to do for the celebration! I like it. You're not married? - And you, what about your husband? - He passed away. An unfaithful man. But we stayed together until the end. It was me who dressed him in his coffin, his wife. - Okay, so you won. - That's right. And what do you do to win? I quit before I lose. - So you don't play. - Yes, I do play. But not like the others. Come here. Ms Chiara? Shit! - Sorry, we have to do the cleaning. - Yes. Just a moment, please. I have to take care of the rooms. See you later. I've got to finish my article. Chiara? You're here. Did you finish? DAY 4 Come on! - Hi! - Hi! Bro, sorry about last time. No, it was my fault. I'm sorry. - Us ex-junkies can't touch anything. - Don't worry. Everything's okay. Stefano called last night. He couldn't reach you. I'll call him back. Listen... We've got the choir, but we have to talk about the music. All the musicians here have died. - What do you propose? - Use CDs. Luigi has a sound system. Fifteen years ago, at that wedding, the music was fantastic. An accordion, a guitar... I want the same music, very folky. We only have two more days. CDs then, if we don't have a choice. You still want sugared almonds in organza bags? Yes! We insist on those silly things. You're right. Those silly things are important. But what's up, bro? You're so different. - Oh, I don't know. - Changed for the better. We ate fried blood yesterday. Must be that. Oh, right, that must be it! Thanks. See you on Saturday! - Bye! Bye. Shall we go? So, who is Stefano? The man I've been living with for 15 years. What does it matter? You want to end it anyway. Why didn't you mention Stefano? But I didn't hide him either. Why didn't you tell me you had someone else? It wasn't worth it. I wanted things to stay easy between us. Luigi, wait! Weren't you going to help me get the mattress to the lighthouse? - I have to go to Trapani for gas bottles. - I asked you to take it today! If you can't wait till tomorrow, take the boat, but it's insane. - And where is the boat? - Down there. - Come on! Stop it. - Why are you taking these photos? - Scared he's going to see them? No, I find it sad. Delete them, please. I'll delete them when we separate. How do you want to separate from me if you can't seperate from those photos? Come on! Okay. - I delete the photos, you call Stefano. - Why? I want to hear how you talk to him. Why did you not mention Stefano? Why didn't you say his name? Because you don't love him anymore. You can't even say his name. If it were solid, you would have said his name. Stefano, it's me, dear. Will you call me back? Bye. Well done. Hi. How are you? We'll see each other on Saturday. Now's not the best time, I'm transporting something. Can we talk again later? Okay, bye. He wants to come tomorrow. - What should I tell him? - You're asking me that? Ask yourself what you prefer, one more day with him or with me. Dear, hi, it's me. No, it's all right. Maybe it's best if you come Saturday. I still have loads to take care of here. - He's not coming. - On Saturday either? Yes, on Saturday he is. You are glad that he's coming? What, are you jealous? We agreed. You suggested ending it Saturday. Think you'll still be able to go to bed with him as if nothing's happened? - How long will you keep pretending? - What do you know? Your relationship is over! Or you wouldn't be having this affair with me! You don't want to face the truth. The truth is you don't know how to love. You think it's time that kills love? It's not time, it's you! You have nothing to offer. Chiara, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Chiara! Chiara! Chiara! Chiara! Can I have a cigarette? Where's your wife? Take two sage leaves. Eat them very slowly. It banishes the demons. Here. Can I have a light? - Oxygen! - Hey! - At home! - C'mon, c'mon! Antonio! It's going to be okay! Bear up, darling! Bear up, I'm here with you. I'm here. - Ivan? - Good evening, Isabelle. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I saw you were online. I wanted to hear your voice. To see you briefly. Are you okay? - Where are you? - In Sicily. I saw two old people who I thought no longer loved each other. But how they looked at each other and held hands made me think about you. About... us. And I started wondering if we could have managed it as well. Ivan, have you been drinking? We could've loved each other to the end, couldn't we have? I don't think so. I don't think you're capable of that. No. I wasn't capable of it. But why not? You were weak. Ivan? - Fried fish, okay? - Have you got any sage? - Yes, I have. - Could I have two leaves of it? Why does he want that? White wine or red wine? Red. I've nearly finished the dress. Tomorrow I'm going to Trapani. Chiara! Chiara! I... I'm lost. I'm confused, I'm sorry. Yes, you can apologize. You ask a woman to end a 15-year relationship and offer three days in exchange. It's really disgusting. If that's how you see it. DAY 5 Well look who's here! You're beautiful. And you've hardly slept. Did you like it? Was it okay? As you see, your wedding could be very, very joyous, very beautiful. - I'd go for the cream coloured bags. - It goes well with the colours of the... Sugared almonds. We'll take 50 bags, each with five almonds of each colour. And your first names? Francesca. And Richard. R- l- C Um... - H, aitch. - A-R-D. Congratulations. You're a lovely couple. Best wishes! Thank you. - Good evening everyone. Sorry I'm late. - Good evening. - What would you like to hear? - The kind of thing you play at weddings. Thanks. It's a nice day. I hope the weather stays like this. I don't know if... if I can find the words. But I can't sleep anymore. I can't eat anymore, I can't do anything. We can't end it like this. I don't know how... to explain it to you. But I need you. I can't go back to my life. It's the first time I've felt like this. I need you. Tell me something. How do you know the love has gone? I feel less desire. - What does that mean? - It means you no longer want to smell her scent. You don't feel like kissing... What's wrong? I can't leave Stefano. I owe him a lot. You don't owe him anything. Now you love someone else, that's it. I have a daughter. She's 17. I had lost custody because... I was on drugs, I was dealing drugs. Without him, I would've lost everything. My daughter, everything! So, what shall we do? Not see each other anymore. Not see each other anymore. Ivan, this is how you do it. Look. You push the wire through the stalk and you wind it around it, like this. You know... We could meet up once a year, for a week, this time of year, at this guesthouse. No, Ivan. We split up tomorrow, as agreed. It's mad, what we won't be able to do. It kills me just thinking about it. Mamma! Let's go to bed, it's late. Yes. We'll carry on tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. What are you doing? - I have to go back to the lighthouse. - At this hour? - Don't you want to stay with me? - I can't anymore. - Don't leave me like this. - I have to go. - I have to protect myself. - From what? From the betrayal that awaits me tomorrow. DAY 6 - Excuse me. - Oh, hello. I've got the money for the choir. Can I pay now? No, forget it. It's our present. - Come and help us at the school instead. Come on, I'll wait for you, okay? - Thanks. - Thanks, very kind of you. - You're welcome. - Yes, Mirko? - Hi, have you seen my e-mail? - Not yet. Why? - I've got very good news. - They've accepted the article Gabriella's over the moon!- Good. A few changes, details, nearly nothing. All the better. Everything okay? Aren't you glad? Sorry, Mirko. I'll call you back. See you the day after tomorrow. Bye. Hi! Bro! Isn't it beautiful? Come on, jump! I can't believe it, we're here! Dear... Hi. I'm so happy! You can't imagine it! - Welcome. - Lovely, you've all come! I'm Stefano, Chiara's partner. You must be Ivan, the groom's brother. Chiara told me about you. Nice to meet you. Mum! - Dad... - My son. - You look tired! I'm the only one with a tie. Can I take it off? Bro, can't we go straight to the lighthouse? Shouldn't she try the dress first? I may have to make alterations. - It starts in two hours. No time. - Of course there's time. She has to see it. Who can drive us there? Take the keys. Pick me up on the way back. - You sure? - I want to walk. - The place is yours. Don't take too long. Ivan! Wait! What you've done is magnificent. You can't imagine what it means to me. Thanks! You deserve it. She's pregnant. Fantastic! Congratulations! Thanks! Richard? - Yes? - I'm glad to have done it. You look really good. Thanks. Tell me the truth. Is there something between you and Ivan? - No. Now stop that! - Come on, tell me. If I tell you nothing's going on, nothing's going on. We've just worked a lot for your wedding, that's all. It's the first time in 17 years that you've lied to me. - Kiss! Kiss! - Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! I'd like to say something to the bridal pair. It's a poem by Pablo Neruda that I love very much. "O Where Can Guillermina Be?" The poem says that love is a gift, maybe the most beautiful gift in life, but it also says that it's fragile. I remember some verses and I'd like to dedicate them to you. "When my sister invited her and I went out to open the door, the sun came in, the stars came in, two tresses of wheat came in and two inexhaustible eyes." "I was fourteen years old, brooding, and proud of it, thin and frowning." "The years went by slowly." "My heart has travelled in the same pair of shoes, and I have digested thorns." "And then, and then... and then..." "It all takes so long to tell." "I came to live in this world." "Where can Guillermina be?" Beautiful, Stefano! To all of you! Thanks. - Cheers! - Congratulations! Cheers! Enjoy the meal! May I? Otherwise there won't be a photo of you. You're funny. Dear friends... Dear friends, I'm very happy, very proud. I'm very happy. Very proud. It's magnificent! It's magnificent! Long live the bridal pair! Long live the bridal pair! Long live the bridal pair! And you? We always thought you'd be the first. - Mum, please. - What's wrong? Can't I say what's on my mind? You don't make a joyous impression. A mother senses these things. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks to the people of the island for welcoming us. Thank you! Thanks to Chiara. And to you, Ivan. Without you, none of this would have been possible. I'd like to thank Richard's parents for being here. You have no idea how important it is to us that you're here. Thanks, Richard. You're the man of my life. I love you more than anything. And, above all, I love the person you help me become. Thank you to all our friends from Pisa. Thank you to the Tuesday group, which listens to me week after week. Thank you for being with me throughout my difficult times. Thank you to life. It's beautiful to see you all together here. Thank you. Pardon me. I made a short film with some photos of my brother and Francesca. I'm really happy for you. Very. Nico, roll it! Oh, that's nice! - What a nice cake! - What a beautiful surprise! - Best wishes from the island. - Thanks! Chiara. I will leave with the musicians, after the party. It's better if we say goodbye now. - Long live the spouses! - Hurray! - Well done! - Good boy! - Well done! - Kiss! - Dance with my brother, come on. - I don't want to ruin your marriage. Come on! Come on everyone! Let's Dance! Best wishes! Have a good trip! Long live the spouses! Ciao everyone, thank you very much! - Here we go! - I'm coming! - See you at the port. - Yes. Leave me a moment longer. I'll join you in the room. But it's late, come on! Leave me a moment longer. I need to talk to Giuseppina. But you have nothing to say to her. But yes, we must set up the whole day tomorrow. Give me a minute. One minute. Follow me to the boat. Stay with me until I leave. Please. Then you may not turn around. You walk in front and I behind. If you love me, don't turn around. Ivan! - Thanks for everything. - I love you. Ciao Nico. Ciao.
