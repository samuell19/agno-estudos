THIS FILM, AT THE 2ND VENICE FILM FESTIVAL, WAS AWARDED THE TROPHY FROM THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATIONS FOR "BEST TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT IN ITALIAN FILM" ♪ I am in everyone's heart ♪ ♪ But I am very sad ♪ ♪ I am the love of the world ♪ ♪ Nobody is for me ♪ ♪ I am everyone's lady ♪ ♪ But my soul cries for you ♪ - No! - Three for one. - No! - Two and a half. - No! - Two and a half. If we start like this, the deal won't go through. Isn't it a magnificent voice? - Be reasonable, dear Veraldi. - Not for anything less. - I can't pay any more. - Come on! For her future films, Gaby can't take the same amount she got for the others. We need twice as much. We are the most important French production house. Gaby was unknown when she came from Italy. - But now you know what she's worth. - I can't. I can't give more. Then forget it! - 400,000 for two films. - 450,000 is my last offer. - No, Veraldi. 425,000! - Goodbye! Veraldi, we are friends. Let's speak calmly. Be reasonable. I already told the lady how we can promote her. - We're the biggest French company. - Yes, yes... She will always be the lead role in our scripts. She'll always be up front. If I give 450,000 lira now, how much will I give for the others? - More. - Oh, no! Give me the briefcase and play that nice record again. We're sure to reach an agreement. I forgot something else - the big expenses I have. Expenses for clothes, screenplays written especially for her, and what about that scandal in the papers? Those are expenses too! Let me finish. And I have enormous advertising expenses! Don't forget about advertising! - Doriot! - We're leaving! No. Come with me! Doriot! Doriot! Doriot! Where is Doriot? - Did you see Miss Doriot? - You're looking for her here? Leave me alone a minute! Tell the director not to worry. Doriot already has her makeup on, understand? You be patient! Enough of all this! Tell the manager that he's paid for that! To bring her... I'm not talking to you! Bring her here with a taxi! Okay, the hotel! Excuse me? Miss? I came because they're waiting for you in the studio. It's 8:15. Maybe they didn't wake you up. May I? May I? Still in the bathroom. Come on... Miss Gaby, it's late! At the studio I said you'd already arrived! Don't get me into trouble. Hurry up. You want me to help you dry yourself? If you are alone, naturally. What? Veraldi, this is a joke, right? My God! Why did she do it? Holy heaven, where is she now? Below the heart? Maybe we can still save her. What? Louder! Just a minute. Where is she now? - In the clinic. - Okay. Who is taking care of her? Professors Donadio and Vanni. - Very well. Wait for instructions. - Okay, Director. I'll call all the directors. Think about the press, Director! Alright, okay! DIRECTORS' MEETING What will happen to my film? Director, an actress once hurt her thumb and wasn't able to work. Everything was ready, and for something foolish, it went to pot! - Did any of you offend her? - No! - What will happen to us? - Don't make me more nervous! Keep yourself busy in the meantime. If everything goes well, in two weeks she will be here again. - What will the press say? - Nothing! That Doriot is sick! - And the publicity? - Continue. - The posters? - Everything will be as before! We spent a lot of money, so we must remain calm! I had Professor Ermoli called. The doctors will save her! They must! So we must remain calm and relaxed. Everything will continue. It will continue! Everything! Continue! Continue! Continue! Continue! Dear Veraldi, I don't know how she could have done such a thing! - She is such a beautiful woman! - It's terrible! I don't understand. She had everything from life! Yesterday we were to sign two new contracts. Something must be up. A man, dear Veraldi. I don't know anything. I always saw her by herself. I can swear to that. I saw her every day. Besides being her manager, I was her friend. We can't know these things. Only she can know that! Only she. The cap. Gas. In her narcotic sleep, her whole life... appears as a vertiginous dream. Gabriella, repeat by yourself. You all sit down. Over the sky and over the sun, the Mother stands... Alright. Now everyone again. All together. Alright. Tell the headmaster... - What? - What? - Professor Sommi isn't here yet. - Alright. Tell the headmaster that I can't substitute anymore because I have a drawing lesson at the complementary school and I must go. Alright, Miss. I'm going to the headmaster to find out if Professor Sommi has come. - Goodbye, girls. - Goodbye, Miss. Until she comes back, we'll be Professor Sommi! Yes! You must look to the right, as the professor does. I must tell you something very sad. Professor Sommi won't be coming anymore. This morning he... There has been a tragedy. - Gabriella! What happened? - I've nothing to do with it. Hurry! Take her over there. I've nothing to do with it. Yes! Yes! A man like Professor Sommi would not have done that if he wasn't under the influence of something! One does not leave his position, his wife and his children! One does not fall in love with a girl! And that girl is you! He wrote it in his letter! One does not run away abroad unless something is up! Only once... did he talk to me. But I didn't tell anyone because my mother... I no longer have my mother. And we can't tell Papa certain things. He talked to me... He talked to me... Where? In the school courtyard. During breaktime? What did he tell you? He told me... He told me that he loved me. Oh! And then? And then... Oh, if I had known! Maybe... Maybe I would have... - I would have... - What? I would have married him? A man with a wife and children! Yes. But he told me... He told me... he told me, "I can't live without you!" Shame on you! Shame! Shame... Wait until I call you. You two, come with me. Gabriella, you didn't eat anything. Have something. It's not her fault! She did nothing wrong! - Nothing happened... - Silence! The daughter of an officer kicked out of school! Oh, if her mother were here! She's lucky that she's no longer here. But I know what to do! I will take over now! Never again in the city! Nor in another school! She won't continue her studies! She will study at home with me! Under my direction! For a year she won't return to Milan and won't see anyone! She will get up early! She will be on time at the table! If there are no rules, there is chaos! It's time to stop going right and left! - She doesn't do anything wrong! - I know! - She doesn't do anything wrong! - I know! She is a dangerous girl and she doesn't know it! I will talk to her! Gabriella, come. I will tell you what will become of you! Don't always look outside! Watch out! Watch out for the roots of every flower you plant! If over 10% dies, there is no profit. I lost a lot last year, so this year is a very poor one! That girl is cute! - We could invite her. - Yes! - No. - Why? - Because of the Professor. - Don't exaggerate! - If she comes, I won't. - Why? My eye! Did something get ruined? No, Papa. A piece of wood fell and I can't find it. Oh, there it is. A broken ruler - "R.N." What can "R.N." mean? "Roberto Nanni has the honour of inviting Anna and Gaby Murge "to the dance he is giving for his schoolmates." - Come. Let's ask Papa. - He won't let us. - Yes. I'll talk to him! - No, Anna... Look, Papa! He's not here! - Papa, where are you? - I'm here. - Gabriella! - I'm here, Papa. Be careful. Before the books on the Boer colonial war, there should be the ones on the Libyan war. Yes, Papa, I'll be careful. I found this Napoleon in the attic. It's still in good condition. It just needs a new glass. "Roberto Nanni has the honour of inviting Anna and Gaby..." Why do they write "Gaby" if your name is Gabriella? "...to the dance he is giving for his school..." I must first talk to your aunt. Let's go to Aunt! - Aunt, where are you? - Listen, Aunt. Aunt, it's important. You must help us! - What is it? - We have an invitation. - An invitation? - From the Nannis. - Who is Nanni? - Nanni! Roberto... - He has a son? - Yes. - Aunt, don't leave. Please wait. - Yes. - You want a potato? - No, Aunt! - You must talk to Papa. - To Papa? Tell him he must not always be so severe with us! You know him. He has his ideas. - I must go to the kitchen. - One more thing. Excuse me, Aunt. Six months have gone by and people don't know, don't look, and comment on everything I do. Papa can hear. Come here. - You must do something. - What? You must convince him to send us to the party. Alright. I'll do what I can, but now I must go to the kitchen! There will be a lovely park, an enormous park... There will be a real orchestra and who knows how late it will last. Maybe all night! What day is it? Where is the calendar? There it is. You know Roberto? He's a dear boy, so nice. He always dresses in blue! Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... - It's on Wednesday! - Good, Aunt! Thank you! Thank you, Aunt! - What dress will you wear? - I don't know yet. I'll wear last year's dress. It's not new, but it'll do. Maybe my hair style isn't glamorous or modern enough. Maybe with some curls. Then stockings, shoes... It will look nice on a white dress. Do you think anyone will dance with me? Good evening, Mariani. Hi, Mario! Hi, Gualtiero. May I? - Thank you. - Why do you thank me? Thank you. Why? Why do you thank me? You don't know... You don't know how I live. Always alone. Always at home. And today all this! It's so lovely! So lovely and I would like... I would like to dance forever. See? This happened because you left me alone. My head is spinning! What did you do here? Nothing. Come. No, this way. - Is that a scar on your forehead? - Yes. - What did you do? - Nothing. - Maybe you got into a fight? - Once. Careful it doesn't become something serious. You're different from the other girls. I wish I'd known you before. I'm leaving tomorrow. - Where are you going? - Rome. Rome! How lovely! Can I write to you? Naturally. Violets - look! I like them so much! I never believed what they say about you. Even before meeting you. When I heard about you the first time... Sir! Excuse me a minute. Yes? Your mother wishes to talk to you. - What is it? - Alone. - Tell her I'll be right there. - Certainly. Excuse me, Gaby. Wait just a minute. I'll be right back. Please. Shame on you! Shame! Shame! Shame on you! Shame! My mother wants to talk to you, but whatever she says... Don't worry. She's only doing it for me. I must see you again. I'll take you home. I must tell you many things. It's the first time you've come here? Yes, signora. Thank you. - You enjoyed yourself, naturally. - Yes, thank you. You don't always have to say thank you. Come here. Sit down. I... I know what it means to have invited me. That's not it. I don't care what people say. I told that to Roberto too. You shouldn't isolate yourself for such a long time. You shouldn't. - Did I upset you? - No. Your son loves you very much, doesn't he? I only have a picture of my mother, when she was 20. It's cold here and it's bad for you. You shouldn't be in the night air. It's not good for you. Thank you. - You speak French, right? - Yes. I haven't had the chance to speak French since I left Russia. Come to see me! I am very much alone. Roberto is going to Rome and my husband is always away on business. - Come. - He must travel a lot - Paris, London...? - So, you'll come? - Yes, signora. - You say he's coming? - Certainly. He's so nice! I like him! Excuse me. The car was in the garage! Please. I absolutely must talk to you, alone. Please. Goodbye. I absolutely must talk to you. I'll wait for you. - Come, please. - I don't know... Goodnight! Thank you! Why don't you undress? Aren't you sleepy? Neither am I. How does he dance? What did you talk about? What are you doing? Where are you going? What are you doing? Move! That's how accidents happen! - Papa, how are you? - What are you doing here? The other car stopped. I heard a man's voice talking to him. But I didn't understand what he said. Then the two cars drove off again. I waited for quite a while, but he never came back. You know who was in the other car? My husband! He came unexpectedly, though, naturally, just passing through. I think he was going to Rome. He hasn't been back here in three months. My boy could hardly say he was waiting for a young lady! I know my boy very well. He isn't a man yet. But he is very good. We still haven't done our written exercises. Gaby, I'd like to do something to please you. You've sacrificed a lot for me. - Oh, no, signora! - Oh, yes. We have a box at La Scala. Do me that favour! You'll see something different. I wish. I don't know if my father will allow me to come home after 8:00. - I'll call him! - Yes, but... But? What is it? I don't have a dress to wear. If that's the problem, I have plenty in my closet! They're all lovely! If you come tonight, we'll alter them. - Do you want me to? Yes? - Thank you. Lovely. Beautiful. You've become a real lady. - You think so? - So entrancing! What is it? Who's coming? Why doesn't someone...? The servants aren't here? Don't worry. I'll go and see. Maybe I'll find a bigger mirror downstairs. Some other time. It is absolutely indispensable! Excuse me. Who are you? I've never seen you in my house. - You are... all this? - Yes. I am Nanni. Put the bags in my room. - Excuse me, Count. - Put the car in the garage and go. - Leonardo, where are you coming from? - London. See? She's so nice. I hope you like her. Naturally. She is a dear girl. She's here every day with me. That is very good of her. - Good morning, Count. - Good morning. - What dress is this? - It's the first time I'm wearing it! She was trying it on because she's going to La Scala. - Are you staying with us? - I still don't know. Too bad. You could accompany her to La Scala. The two hadn't even exchanged a word. Maybe they knew nothing about each other. And maybe... they'd never seen each other. At this point he returns home after the round. - She goes to the village. - Yes, at the end of the first act. The troops return after the victory. We are in the 1800s. All the balconies have flowers and are full of beautiful women. Lights shine everywhere. In the music, there is the passion of this night. Then, silence, you hear a shot, he's wounded, and now appears in the crowd a woman. Then something wonderful happens because his voice at first is soft, but slowly it becomes stronger because she... she is present. Let me talk. It's better. Hello? Colonel? I'd like to ask you a favour. Can Gaby sleep with me tonight? I don't feel very good. She'll sleep next to me and tomorrow my husband will take her home. Alright, signora, even if I don't agree very willingly. Can I talk a moment to Gabriella? Hello? Yes, Papa. Yes. It was so wonderful, so wonderful. Fantastic. You must be home tomorrow morning at 8:00 precisely. - There's a lot to do! - Yes, Papa. I'll come. Thank you and good night. Papa, wait a minute. Hello? Nanni speaking. I wanted to thank you, dear Colonel. Thank you and good night. - There. Everything is okay. - Alright. Good night. I am very happy. - Good night. - Good night. So? Tell me. In the second act, the young officer takes her with him, to the war campaigns. A young officer, alone with a woman. Until the emperor sees her, takes her away, and sends the young officer to... Come in! What you prepared in the other room is very nice, but I'd like a cigarette, please. I can never smoke in my house and it must be nice to sleep with some smoke in the bedroom and with the windows open. There! Oh, there are none left! We'll find them over there. So he sends the young officer to France. No, he sends him to England. Yes, to England, not to France. But that doesn't matter. What's important is the way he pursues the woman! He appears in Berlin, at night, he calls her name in the streets! Then... Thank you. It's very good. Then he goes crazy in jail. It's fantastic when a man does all this for a woman. It's magnificent. - And that is the end? - Yes. Yes. No, Papa doesn't want that! You must go right back home. Maybe your father will allow Gaby to stay here longer. Since she's been here I feel a lot better. It seems like a miracle, doesn't it? Papa is very busy. There is the flower picking now. I don't know... I can't imagine you won't be with me. You won't sleep next to my room anymore. Me neither, but tonight I will sleep here again! - Yes, but tomorrow? - Tomorrow I'll come. But let's not talk about it now! - What should I tell Papa? - Tell him I said hello! And tell him not to be angry with me. Bye! Bye. And Roberto? How is he? Does he write? - He's fine, why? - Just curious. Goodbye. Goodbye, Gaby! Will you come for sure? Yes, I will. - Where? - Where? - Who was it? - My sister. - What did she want? - She had a message for me. Who from? - From my father. - What is it? I must go back home. No! Yes! - When? - Tomorrow. Hi, Leonardo! How good of you. You're already here! Yes. I finished earlier for once! Till next week I won't go back to Milan! I hope to stay here for eight full days. But... Too bad! - A lot? - A lot. - You're not coming? - We're coming, we're coming. - Did you talk to her? - Yes. - Did you manage to convince her? - No. What did she tell you? That she's sorry to go but she has duties. Yes, I must leave tomorrow. Right. You have to go. With you here I'll sleep peacefully another night. - Good night, Gaby. - Good night, signora. No, not "signora"! I can't get used to it. Good night, Alma. So you're leaving? I want to tell you a secret. Remember when you came the first time? It's hot today, isn't it? - I called Roberto, remember? - Yes. Because he'd been with you in the garden a long time. I was afraid of that thing... that thing at school. - What time is it? - 11:00. Now I really... I really am fond of you. My husband has changed a lot too. Right. He is no longer a man who only talks about business. He often comes to see us and stays a long time. He has become a very different man. Gaby, thank you. Good night, Alma. Good night, Gaby. I'd like to listen to the radio, if it doesn't bother you. It doesn't, but you must rest. The doctor forbade you to tire yourself. What? What are you doing here? - What do you want? - Gaby. - Go away, please. - I need to see you, Gaby. - I need to speak to you. - Quiet. Go away. I'll go away if you come down to the garden. Gaby, remember this music? Gaby, if you leave... I must tell you something. If you leave think that... Alma is sick. And I could be left alone. Alone. You must promise me not to love anyone else but me. Because I love you, Gaby. I don't care what people say. We must live alone, happy, without worrying about what... Did you hear anything? What was it? Ignore it. I knew from the first moment that you love me. I don't know how to say it, but I can't live without you any more. - What's the matter? - Don't say that. Please, don't say that. Listen. Listen, this is our music. It's not good. I shouldn't... Help! Help! Free her. I don't want to ever hear it again! I don't want it anymore! No! No! I don't want it! I don't want it! Roberto, when are you leaving for Rome? Tomorrow morning at 10:00. Will you come and see me? I still don't know. Maybe... Maybe when I get back from London. I don't know, I don't know yet. I can't assure you. Don't be so upset, Papa. How mother would suffer! We want to keep our mourning in our hearts, but we must try to be serene. We must continue our life, right? Forgive me, Papa. All these days I wanted to tell you something. I would've asked Mother too but it is more important now because she is no longer here. There isn't a woman in the house any more. I saw her in church today after almost a year. Papa, I want to marry Gaby. No! I'll never forget how he said those words. I will never forget it. Why do you only say this today? - I will never forget it. - Why do you say this only today? We can't stay here anymore. The memory of all those people, all those known faces. We can't stay here anymore. If only one could forget! Forget! Forget! You're right, Leonardo. We need to forget! But it's not our fault! It's not our fault, Leonardo! Papa, Anna... We can't go back anymore! It's not possible! - Leonardo! Leonardo! - Gaby! Relax, Gaby. I am here with you because I love you, Gaby. Leonardo, let's go far away, very far. We'll travel a lot, and come back late, very late! Gaby, we will leave together. All that happened doesn't matter anymore because now we can live in peace, Gaby. We will be happy together. - I won't work for a while. - For how long? I don't know. A week, a month, a year... Gaby, because... Now we will be happy. You will be my wife. Welcome, signora. Good morning, signore. Thank you, Giovanni. Why this? Giovanni, why this light? I'll have the rooms prepared right away. I think that by changing and removing some things here, we can... - Giovanni, is there any mail? - Yes, in your study. - Some light will come in. - But here... Nothing, nothing has changed here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Leonardo! Leonardo, where are you? I'm checking the mail. - Did Papa write? - No. - Anna? - Nor Anna. It's cold in here. Fix something quickly. I am very tired. Yes, signora. Spring is late this year. - A telegram from Roberto! - What does it say? Is he coming? "I am not coming. Please don't write me anymore. "Roberto." We are very much alone, very alone. I so much wanted to embrace him. It doesn't matter. - Relax. Try to rest. - Rest. Rest! We've travelled so much. It's impossible. We've never rested. I won't sleep in this house. I can't live in this house. I want to go away. - Take me away. I want to go away! - Don't get upset. - Why are you upset? - I want to go away! Are you going mad? - What's wrong with you? - I can't stay here! I can't! I can't! Leonardo! Leonardo, come here! The music! - Leonardo! - You're going mad! There is no music! Hear that? No music. Signora, there is no music in the house. Leonardo, please... Giovanni... Turn off the radio! Please, Giovanni! No, signora. We no longer have a radio, since the death of the poor signora. - No! - Calm down! - No! I can't! - Gaby! No! I don't want to! Gaby! What are you doing? I don't want to anymore! - I want to get out! - Gaby! What are you doing? The doorman could hear! Alright. I'll look for a house nearby! The house must be fit for living in a few days. The house needs to be liveable in a few days. It has to be isolated with a big park. Remember to send money right away. It's urgent. I need your decision for the deal in England. For the industrial business. And for the electric company, and the Paris affair is urgent. All this is of no importance. Send the money for the house right away. Confidential. Today's date. Dearest gentlemen, I only arrived today... from my trip. It is my intention to justify, in a general meeting, the accusations against me, through the mail. The cause of my delay is due to personal reasons. - Come in. - May I? What is it? Director, our personal account is not covered at the moment. Get the money from a deposit, from the company. I will settle everything in two or three days. - Alright. Good night. - Good night. Where was I? Personal reasons. I intend to ask the council for a general meeting the day after tomorrow. - Good morning. - Good morning. Gentlemen. First of all, I will talk about things that took place during my absence. - Some mistakes were made... - Forgive the interruption. On behalf of all the council members I ask director Nanni how and why his absence lasted so long. This absence caused us much damage. After 15 years of uninterrupted activity I have the right to think about my personal life. But with the letter of March 11th, the telegram of March 24th, the letter of April 7th, with the telegram of the 24th, and on the phone the same day, and the following day, we communicated to you repeatedly that your presence was absolutely necessary. The letters never arrived and I wouldn't have been able to come. - Anyway, it's not important. - Not everyone feels that way. - Must I beg? - I must beg you to explain the reason of your withdrawal from the company funds of an amount for your personal use. It was in good faith, and I can return the amount immediately. - No! - I only need a few days. - I guarantee. - With what? I forbid you to doubt my word! Hello? Yes? Just a moment, please. I wanted... I wanted to tell you something. In a few minutes... my train is leaving. Leonardo, you must stay with your wife. You must stay with her, even if she is no longer here. You know why I'm leaving you? I'm leaving you so you'll have peace again. So that you can work again. - Where are you going? - Maybe to Paris. But I don't want to tell you. It's better we don't write anymore. Because I... I must no longer exist for you. I didn't have the strength to hang up the receiver. I did all I could. I did it for him. I didn't know what consequences my talk would have had. LEONARDO NANNI SENTENCED 4 YEARS PRISON TERM FOR EMBEZZLEMENT He didn't defend himself and never explained why he did it. That is the real reason for his disgrace. Meanwhile, I worked. Later on, I was told everything, but I didn't return. I learned to act, and for a whole year, as often happens, I went from one movie company to another. I had a small part. I worked a lot and suffered hunger. I wrote him many letters in prison, but they were all returned. He, too, knows we cannot live together. You know what I wrote, of all that you just told me? This. Nothing. They're not things one can talk about into a microphone. This could be the story of a novel, of a film, not the biography of an actress. An actress must be as the public wants her, full of sunshine and youth. The public doesn't want to know the things you told me. It is the truth. If I must speak, I'll tell the truth. The life of our dear Gaby Doriot is full of all those elements and signs of fortune, and great joy and beauty. I remember when I saw her the first time here in Paris. She was with her mother in luminous Montmartre... driving a magnificent car. I immediately realised youth was passing by. Fortune was passing by. This woman was loved by millions of men. This woman enchanted millions of men. GABY DORIOT TALKS ABOUT HER LIFE What are you doing? Yes, it's Gaby. Go. This is an opening. You can only enter in evening dress. Go away. - I know her... - Alright, go. That way. ♪ I am everyone's lady ♪ ♪ But I am very sad ♪ ♪ I am the love of the world ♪ ♪ Nobody is for me ♪ ♪ I am everyone's lady ♪ ♪ But my soul cries because ♪ ♪ I am the most envied in the world ♪ ♪ Love, my love for you ♪ "He who has fallen forever on the cement of a big city "was once a dominator." Yes, unfortunately. "This man fell, overtaken by passion for a famous woman." Now comes the garbage. "Maybe she knowingly dragged him to his ruin. "At the time of his splendour, she was his lover "and left him when his decline began, without ever looking back." What garbage! What is this trash magazine called? La Vérité. (Truth.) I can't read any more. How disgusting! They should be reported. Certain people shouldn't be put on trial. They should be whipped or made to pay! What do you think, signora? It's vulgar that all this becomes known to the public. It was different between us. You understand, director? No, it's too difficult to understand. You artists live in another world. But that's not the problem. The scandal must stir up a great reaction around you. What do you say? I wouldn't say the scandal... I don't think... The lady is a foreigner. Maybe it is a risk... A risk. A great risk. Maybe, but it increases interest. No. The lady's personality must be defended. What's needed is a public statement. No. Today nobody believes denial anymore. What's needed is a respectable family member who writes a touching letter that will be printed. Who? A relative? Signora, you have no family members left? A sister, an uncle, an aunt? You have nobody left? No. I broke all ties with my family. But once you told me something very nice. You spoke about a son Signore Nanni had. Yes. Where is this young man now? We must find him and bring him here. I'll take care of it. I'll bring him here, to the lady's dressing room or to her home. You will talk to him. Very well. He'll believe me. - Veraldi. - Nanni, my pleasure. Roberto. It's you! The lady wishes to talk to you privately. The attorney's expecting us at 6:00. Go take a walk. We'll leave you alone until then. - Director, I have a car. - Then let's take advantage of it. - I believe you, Gaby. - Thank you, Roberto. It's strange. Certain events of my life - I don't know if it happens to you too - return to my mind when I think of a melody. It's lovely. Remember that evening when you invited me to dance? Yes. Memories come to my mind too. It's strange, the way life depends on little things. If that evening my mother hadn't called me just when I wanted to tell you something... I didn't know how to behave with women. I wanted to talk to you about this scar. I defended you when I didn't even know you. That's the way it was. We were returning home from school and we went past your garden. A boy said bad things about you. That is the reason for the scar. - And now? - I believe you, Gaby. - Are you alright? - Yes. Tell me, Roberto... Are you alone? I'll go to the attorney and sign everything you need. When your ruler fell into the garden, I took it and I still have it. Here you are! 5:45! The attorney! - See you at 8:00 in the hotel. - Yes, I'll be there. Let's go. Enough of this personal business. Hello? Yes, Roberto. Are you coming? - No? - I wanted to say goodbye to you. - Why? - Gaby... I cared for you very much. And I care very much for you still today. - Maybe more than... - I understand. - Your sister... - I don't know where she is. - Your sister... - Where is my sister? It is so hard to say it. I couldn't even say it today. When everything Papa owned was auctioned... And now a real artist's work. 400 - going... going... - Here. - Here's the gentleman. A magnificent silver candle holder. How much is being offered? - 20 lira. - 20 lira - going... Roberto. She walked with me in the garden that was no longer ours. We spoke at length about you. I will never see Gaby again. We never understood each other. But it's not her fault. She was already like that as a child. You two look alike. Then, in a very kind and intelligent way, she asked: Roberto, what do you plan on doing now? What I always wanted to do - work. I never liked the life my father led. I studied agronomy. I'm going to be an agronomist. We spoke often and at length. Now Anna is my wife. She was very lucky. If that night in the garden, I'd given you a kiss maybe things would have been different. Who knows where we would be today? Who knows where! Tell me, Roberto, do you have children? Then kiss... kiss Anna and the children for me. - And I'll see you again. - Where? In the film. When it comes to us, to Italy. In the film... in the film... In the film... I had a big success with the film and I conquered what people called happiness. But I was so alone in life! I had freed myself of my passion for Leonardo, but when I wanted to go back to you, Roberto, to love, it was too late - so I... It was a desperate case. - The heart was weak. - It's over. Stop!
