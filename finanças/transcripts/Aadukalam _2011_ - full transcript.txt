Fighter cocks! To defend their territory... ...and to claim the female of the species... ...fight each other fiercely. Man observed there roosters fighting, understood the nuances... ...and made that wild fight in to a sporting art. It is part of the cultural heritage of Tamils as any other aboriginal society. Rooster fight generally is a man's sport. References of Rooster fights are in abundance... ...throughout the 3000 years of Tamil literature. Charging, pouncing, dodging, spurs piercing... ...bleeding, still tearing in to opponent's flesh... ...roosters pure bred will go for the kill even with a mortal wound. Tamil poem 400 BC. The wake of 21st century saw governments of the world... ...ban Rooster fight in the name of animal rights. But people still hail this traditional art with pride. The gurus of this art still keep their rearing and training nuances hidden... ...and pass it on only to their chosen disciples. It is not just the Roosters in the arena fighting but also the men behind them. In this too, vengeance, betrayals... ...spilling of blood, everything is there. At times vengeance in the cock fights ends in death too. You go, check in the house. Brother! It's blood all over. I don't know what happened to him, brother. What are you saying? Shall we inform brother? - No. How he's staring? Move! Few days earlier, on a Sunday evening... ...just out of the town, two groups of about 100 to 150 people had gathered. They were arranging cock fight as usual. Suddenly police raided the competition started this! Police! Escape! Why did you steal the cocks? They're making all this fuss because of this, right? Let's make it mince meat. The competition took place in Rathinasamy's place. Rathinasamy, a police inspector... ...but belongs to a family which has been in cock fights for many generations. Landlord! To him everything else is second to cock fight. He'll do anything to win in that. You can never catch me! Try it! If I catch, you'll see hell! If I get down into it... Try it, you keep your shoes polished always, try to catch me. Keep them safely, lest may get caught. Everything's safe. Rathinasamy has never lost a cock fight to anyone. Except one man! Pettaikaran! Pettaikaran isn't as rich or powerful as Rathinasamy. But in the cock fights going on between them for the past 30 years... ...Rathinasamy has never won over Pettaikaran. Buddy, they stole our cock. - What are you saying? Yes, it's a sentiment, don't know what happened to it? Stop! Buddy, got caught? - Good judgment. Change the gear and get going. Lawyer sir. - Tell me, Durai. Police raided and arrested brother, come to W1. - Okay. You never let us eat and take rest at home even on Sundays. You come out to trouble by early morning. What's so attractive in this? Keep it safely. Stop... if get hold of you, I'll break your limbs. Idiot! Idiot! Are you blind or what? What's this? - Just keep watching the fun. Always chasing someone to catch, run faster sir! Nobody could win over Pettaikaran because of his cocks. He never sells it to anyone, just lets his disciples to raise it. So, the fighting techniques taught to the cocks remain secret within the group. And then those three people with him, Durai... ...runs a bar in Thirupparankundram... ...he finances to get ready the cocks to fight for Pettaikaran... ...Karuppu... ...he's the guy who initiates Pettaikaran's cocks to fight in any competition... ...he hasn't lost a fight yet as a jockey... Ayub... ...he treats the injured Pettaikaran's cocks in fights... ...gets it ready to fight in the next round to win. Don't know why I went to work... Hey! Hey! How can you take rations of so many cards alone? Can't you ask your son to help carry it? Before I can find him, I can carry it to home. The chase has begun, your son is on run. If I catch you, you're dead. Oh no, he's standing here only. Greetings. - Come, nephew! Can't you see much now? Are you going to work properly? - I'm going to work only, uncle. Have a coffee? No need uncle. I've work. - You've work? Nagavalli wants to see you. - I'll come there, uncle. Come home. - Come behind me, we can catch him. Tell Nagavalli that I'll come tomorrow, uncle. Police raided as the cock fight between... ...Pettaikaran and Rathinasamy was in progress. Look, they're coming running. Buddy, uncle saw me don't know what he'll tell with Nagavalli. No competition and police have raided... ...and they've stolen our cock too... ...I'm worried about brother's reaction, and you're worried about your love. You too will know when you'll face it yourself. Stop there I say! Stop! Buddy! Have we killed anyone? We organised a cock fight and they're after our lives. This is all Rathinasamy's plan. Buddy, jump into water. Jump! Subbaiah head constable... Why are you asking me to jump? You jump. Next time, I'll not let you off so easily. Nobody can escape easily, everyone will go to jail. If I had asked them to raid, why would they arrest my boys too? If I could do, why would I do now after so many years? No need to fight anymore, let's withdraw. You can't say that, I've a bet. I've to decide whether or not about next fight. No sir, I can't fight with sir anymore. If the loser wants a fight you must accept it. Why are you changing the tradition? Who's changing the tradition? They've started the new tradition of raiding... ...the competition and stealing the cock. Are you backing off in the fear of losing? I'll cut your throat, we are winners, why would we think about losing? Wait. Will you be happy if I say yes? Yes, I'm backing off in the fear of losing to you, okay? They're winning championship of losers, why are you denying that opportunity? Won't they get vexed? There's nothing short cursing. Okay brother... cool... cool... Why are you talking irresponsibly before an elderly man? Brother, the matter is, I'm losing continuously, the must keep competing till I win. I've accepted that I can't fight and win against you, right? You saw his wry smile, didn't you? Let him smile, forget it. People know who is better talented. If he backs off from fights... ...he'll walk away with the pride of victory... ...and should I live all my life as a loser? I can't accept this. Don't keep on harping about that only. Don't I know what to do? He called police today to stop from losing, next time he may kill to win. You don't do anything in haste, I'll see that he accepts to fight. I'll keep quiet without troubling him on your word. If he refuses you also... He has lost faith in his cocks, that's why he's getting down to these tricks. Hereafter it's not safe to fight with him. Hubby! If I accept the fight for honour, all of you'll in trouble. Should we get insulted for this, brother? Even in death, the pride is in dying victorious. If he accepts, it'll end with cock fight, if not, I'll not spare him. Have you won? - He must... go away mother. Have you seen your son? He has come after losing yet again. If you want me to win over him, get back the stolen cock. Our cock mustn't be with Rathinasamy. Go to every home of his cronies. Hello! It's not in Aramandiayyan's house or in quarters. We've searched. - Okay, cut the line. It's not in Aramandaiyyan or in quarters... ...they're going to Rathinasamy's house. Just a cock is stolen, why are you mourning for it? Go home. Why are you dismissing it cheaply? It was won 13 fights. Can't leave it so easily? Hello. - I'm Sundar here, brother. Thangapandi of Railway colony... - Who is it? Councillor who was killed in Tharapadi, his brother... ...there's a new coop in his home, I think our cock is there. If our cock is with hen, cut the hen. Wait, don't go alone. Won't it be right if he goes? - No. I said you may get scared. Buddy, you stay here, I'll go alone. If I leave you alone, Durai didn't send me for that, right? Buddy, it's caged along with hen. It has already laid an egg. It's perfect, let's take that also after informing brother. Who are you? What are you doing? Hey! If you shout, I'll cut your throat. Silence! Hubby! Karuppu on line. Go ahead. It's all over here. Shall I steal it? You went there because they stole our cock. How can you do the same mistake which they did? The hen is perfect... silence... - What? Nothing brother... here... We've got it. - No use in stealing their hen. Just do what I told you. - Shall I bring it, brother? If you leave it there, my breed of cocks will grow there. Kill it and come. Very happy boy! Though I didn't see the girl properly, she was fair... ...agreed she saw me with fear... ...yet, I fell for her. How late night you came back to home? You... I've never gone crazy over any girl till now. What a beauty! She was fragrant, her hair too. She was aromatic! Though she belongs to enemy zone, she was very attractive. Take it. He'll go mad one day talking to himself. Okay, I'm your son, how can I be different? You can't understand my love. Where did you get the coffee from? Tasteless. How many times I've told you to buy milk and make coffee at home? Can't you do that also? Why are you so lazy? - As if I'm sleeping all day. Yesterday only I sold kerosene to the shops... ...they'll pay money tomorrow only. I'm confused over how to make ends meet till then. You didn't bother to ask about that. But you know to order and question why I didn't do this. If you do your duty properly, why would I ask you? What great duty have you found? How do you run the family without kerosene in home? Are you questioning me? How long this house is under mortgage? Have you ever thought of redeeming it? Lender is asking embarrassing questions. I've to answer him also. I'm your mother and alone, I'm struggling to meet both ends meet... ...did you ever think of sharing my burden? I'm talking to you. Okay mother, stop your lecture. - You spend all the day with him. Do you get atleast a penny from him? Stop it, don't talk about brother, it'll spoil the relationship. Stupid relationship! Useless fellow. You spend all time at home with cocks. Watch out, one fine day I'll cook all of them and eat. If you dare touch it, I'll kill you. I sell drugs, they'll pay anyway. Hey Sundar, come here. Who cut the hen in my neighbour's place? Who did you call last night? - Why are you asking me that? Idiot! I saw you last night, don't lie to me. We stole the cock and hid it in neighbour's place. Fearing trouble if it's in my house, hid in the neighbour's place. Will you inform them about it? Punch him. - Don't beat me. Punch him down. Pin him. They told me to call and I did, Karuppu cut the hen. If we steal the cock, will you kill the hen? What else you want me to do then? You want to give our breed to you. We should've taken you in yesterday's meeting. What's this? You stole the cock, we should be doing this but you're doing it. Already brother doesn't want any more competitions with you. If we fight now, we can never compete in the cock fight. Don't you know that? Silly... Go... go home and tell your boss. Buddy look, he's running... scared. Hey, don't hit me... I'll crush you! You stole their fighter cock without my knowledge and brought bad name to me... ...now, you want me to file a case on him... ...I'll talk to them. Leave it. My nephew got hurt in this fight. If I wanted I would've got them arrested and lynched them in jail long back... ...why didn't I do it? My aim isn't finishing them, but to win in the cock fight. If you steal their cock, they're bound to cut our hen... ...already they're refusing for cock fight thinking we raided the place... ...we must somehow make them accept the challenge... ...so what I'm saying is... - If we spare him, he'll trouble us. Who's asking you to spare him? He wants you not to trouble him with this problem. Won't he get caught in any other problem? If he does, finish him. Why did you come here? Please go away. Why are you getting tensed? I'll see the girl once and go away. If they see me with you, they'll beat me again. Okay, where's the girl studying? Are you human? They beat me for a hen. That girl is going with her father. Go and see her. - Which one? I saw her! She's ravishing! Look, there she goes! Buddy, I saw her so I'm warning you... ...she'll not fall for you... ...for our range we can get Nagavallis only. The point is not whether I get her or not... ...if I see the girl speaking just once... ...that Madras man wants to buy the cock for a price... ...he's ready to pay Rs.15000. - Why don't you tell I don't sell cocks? You heard what drug peddler Sundar said, right? That girl cried when I cut the hen, right? This is ridiculous, mom. Tell her what she would miss if she doesn't apply for this scholarship. Leave us alone men. I'll talk to her. You are spoiling my child with your pampering. Sweetheart, why don't you want to go to Australia? All of us would like to be there. Apply for this scholarship, child. You can even settle down there. As what? As an outsider. I belong here. When I was your age, there used to be 50 Anglo-Indian families in this same colony. Now there are only 3 families left, our days are over in this land... ...you don't have a future in this place, my child. You've to move on. Who are you? What do you want? She knows me. - I'm asking you, who are you? Those guys are our opponents... ...they gave the stolen cock to your brother. Hey, who are you? What do you want? Last night... I had no other choice, I had to cut your hen. Brother's order, can't disobey. Hey, I'm asking you, what's the matter? I've brought a replacement for it. You were crying. I was moved by your feelings. If you hatch eggs, it'll be good. Will you leave the place or not? I'll take the bag tomorrow morning. Stafford, I don't want to see you bringing any more of these damn birds... ...cocks into the house of mine. Better you start studying... Though not to my expectations, she's great. This is too much. She's wearing shorts. Son, eat properly... eat. Take this! Where is he? Here! He's like a Westerner's son. I didn't tell him anything. Sister! Buddy! Buddy, I'm calling you. Hey come here! Chasing our girls? With rogues like you chasing them, they are unable to go out freely. If Tamil girls face a problem, you all gang up to question it... ...but if our girls face the same problem, will you come to their rescue? You call them names as 'Appakari, Sattakari'... ...and say cheaply this is routine in their lives. Till now I was after her without any intention. The moment he told me, I made a decision... ...that I must look after the girl very well hereafter. Who else can secure her better than me? Nicholas! - Yes! My friend, talk to him. Nothing much, a small in the quarters... ...now that we are friends, I'm asking you. Friend? I'm talking to you because Sundar told me. You know it, right? - Is it so? Please take off your goggles. - Why? Why? Would anyone wear dark glasses at night? Remove it! He's our friend, don't threaten him. He's handsome. Buddy, you keep quiet. Remove it. - Why? why? I said remove it. He needs to pay Rs. 500 to Sundar for drugs... ...if he doesn't become our friend, he knows Sundar will not supply him, right? Buddy, aren't we friends? You wear it, buddy. Brother may get angry. Hey, look there's someone here to call you as brother. Till now I was talking to you respectfully, how dare you call him brother? Wear the goggles. Remove it. - Wear it. Remove it. - What do you want? My friend. Hello. - Hello. Hello. Go and stand there. Go I say! Buddy! Hi. I need your bike. And then buddy... Did you observe she saw me? He's that girl's brother. Don't bowl on legs. Wherever I bowl, he's defending it with his legs. Can't you watch and play? - Why are you tied down here? Get going. How dare you beat me in my area! I'll come back with my gang. Come quickly, I'll wait for you here only. Look, he's hitting the ball on top. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? What do you want? What's your problem? K P Karuppu. What do you want? - Balls! What? - Balls... balls... Instead of following me where ever I go... ...why can't you just come home and talk to me? Buddy, she insulted me by saying come to home. That's why I warned you to stay away from her. Look, you're now in trouble. How can you face her now? Is come to home such a bad word, buddy? Watch now! Come to my home. Look at your dirty face! I'll beat you with slippers. I'll tell sister Nagavalli. I was just testing you, carry on. Would she really tell Nagavalli? Is that the problem now? Tell me what should I do next? What am I to tell you? It's all over for me and you too! Come to home means, you come to home. No buddy, I was taught like that only. You can call a flower as blossom, bloom. - It can be called as sister said. Why did she say it so angrily? - You've to ask her that. I'm here! Okay? I told him to come home thinking he'll not dare come home. I never expected he'll turn up here. We came here to offer prayers, right? I expected a grand feast, looks like they'll finish with a bun and drink. What's it child? Who made you cry? Stop crying. Hey Nicholas, come here. Who is my angel? Something nice to eat. Who is that bugger, man? I know him quite well, he's a good friend of mine. I'll take care. It would've been fine if you'd served biryani. It's food only when I chew bone... Irene! I'm love you! What does he think of himself? How dare he says that! As if I'm the only girl in the universe. I deserve somebody better than that moron. Why did you do this? This is so bad! Oh God! Did he see himself in the mirror? Is it him? Come without seeing that side. Tell me, is it really him? I told you not to look that side, come quietly. Oh God! Had he told me that I would've committed suicide the same day? He entered that girl's house the other night. I love her for 3 years and yet I haven't dared to do it. Would we allow outsiders into our area? You don't worry, kid. Let him come today. What's this man your cycle chain breaks down here only every day? Found it? You're still very innocent. - Trying to act smart? What else then? How much trouble I'm taking to attract her? Only when I do such acts I can fool guys like to attract her attention. That girl and he are in love sincerely for 6 years... ...if you fish in trouble waters to split them, I'll kill you. Fear of losing her in the love arena, trying to flex muscles. Hello. - Go ahead. Look, Karuppu. - I'm seeing you. You're after that girl for something else. But I love her sincerely. We kissed lip to lip behind that church on many Sundays, you know that? If you want I'll show you photos. You claim to love her but say bad about her. She's coming here. Let's ask her. Look sister, I'm like your brother here. You don't need to fear anyone. Do you love Dinesh or that guy? That guy! This is too much! I'm telling you, please leave the shop. Nagavalli too said she loves me, but I didn't dance like this. Hey, look at him. Hey, what are you doing? What madness is it? I'm very happy today. He's very angry because you didn't come for few days. Thanjavur tournament is fast approaching... ...I told you to come early to get ready the cocks... ...are you roaming and coming leisurely? This is okay. - Okay brother. Cut that cock. Karuppu, get yours. Is it good to cut a cock for backing off once, brother? The cock belongs to him, the competition goes on his name... ...if he orders to cut, you must do it. Karuppu, mine backed off few steps only, looks like yours will run back to home. What can he do if your cock backs out? No brother, I don't what's wrong with it. Cut it. - Brother! Pettaikaran's cock must face the death bravely in the arena only... ...it shouldn't run away from it... ...even if it has to die, it must come out of the arena to die. Cut it I say! Durai, get ready the other cocks for the tournament. Okay brother. Brother, boss asked if you've cut the cock or not. What can it do if we don't look after it well? Mother! Rathinam, I'm scared. Nothing will happen to you mother, be brave. What happened, doctor? - Let's wait till tomorrow evening. Can I inform relatives, doctor? - Go inside. Grandma, drink this and sleep. Father, she's refusing to drink. - You go. Mother, drink this and sleep. No use in winning in other places... ...win over Pettaikaran here and bring back the lost honour. We mustn't losers to anyone. Don't let them to win. Win at any cost. Where's your owner? - Who knows where is he? How dare you lie to me! - Sir, leave him, what's the problem? Who are you? - I'm Durai, I own this bar, why? I'm sure it's him. But there has been no raid from your station. If they had decided to create trouble, they wouldn't tell from which station. There are so many but all I've is a useless officer. What? - What are you doing there? Wait, I'm coming. Okay, I'll check tomorrow morning from Commissioner's office. What's this, brother? If we let him stay there overnight, he may not live to see tomorrow. You want him to visit every station and find him. Greetings sir. What brings you so far sir? Had you informed I would've come to you, sir? Is SI in office? - He's here sir. - Greetings sir. What man? Your girth has increased rapidly in 6 months. Good second income? Not much sir, it was better when you were here, sir. Sir, Thirunagar Inspector is here to meet sir. So quick? Close it, cat may lick it. - Okay sir. Greetings sir. - Greetings. You could've finished dinner. - No problem sir. Did you raid the bar? - Yes sir. Got a call from Commissioner's office. They are selling spurious liquor. What's this? Who isn't selling spurious things? It's common. He's our man, don't register any case. No sir, Commissioner's order, can't defy him, sir. Hardly 10 days have passed since Commissioner has come to this city... ...anyway he'll get transferred in another 6 months... ...but we are living here since generations, we know people very well here. Take them inside. If we arrest our boys without any charges, is it respectable? Go inside man. I'll tell him to do what Commissioner asks... I can't let you keep my man in station, release him first. Okay sir. I was scared, doctor said let's wait and see. Now she's fine. Come in. Come up, Durai. Sundar, get him a chair. Come in... are you Raja? No... no... you don't know him. Mix it well. - Please sit down. You come to me only when you've work. Why are you saying like that, brother? You're a big shot. You took big risk and got me out. You're my boy, forgetting about the fight... Is he our boy? Be on his side like brother to win the fight. He'll come... You're picking up fights casually. If not to you, who else would I help? No brother, I've given you a hell lot of trouble. Without taking it to your heart... - Forget it. Won't you come to my rescue if I'm in trouble? I'll definitely come, brother. He isn't as good man as you think he is. He's a schemer, we must be careful. Who so ever it may be... ...when I was in trouble... ...people who know me for many years didn't turn up to help me... ...he came, didn't he? You're here for so many years, don't you know how to feed it? Give me the cock. Leave it, Karuppu will take care of it. I'll take leave, brother. I had asked money for the station matter... ...he has promised to give, I'll be on it. What happened brother? He's changing his heart as the situation demands. Who, brother? - I said in general. Durai now feels Rathinasamy is a good man. He'll know his true colour as time passes. Hereafter, you, me and Ayub, just three of us. Don't tell him about this discussion. No brother. Hello. - Hi! This is Irene... You're going to meet your lover for the first time. Don't go empty handed. My brother told me to with flowers. See, I want to talk about an important thing... Till now it was different when I troubled you. First time we are meeting as lovers. Never had this experience, so I'm nervous. Will you please let me talk? - Talk. You know that other guy Dinesh? He was torturing me for many days now... ...he tortured me more than what you did... I lied loving you to discard him. - Lied to me? I didn't mean to hurt you. - But the truth is... - Mad! Crazy girl! But since that evening I've been trying to get in touch with you. I've been what... - Talk to me in Tamil. I wanted to tell about this that same evening. But you didn't come. You got my number and called me on phone, right? Couldn't you do this... - Please try to understand. I didn't want to hurt you. I'm furious on you. How many love scenes I had imagined in these two days. Now you say coolly... My house is very small. So my mother goes to the neighbour to sleep there at night. Only then we can sleep together happily, right? How many times can I've... Forget it. When we had gone to our family deity's temple to offer our first child's hair. You were in a sari. My mother says this. Hey Karuppu... ...this girl has come leaving behind everything considering you as a man... ...that's your bail... ...and you come now to tell me, you don't love me... ...and to hear this, I'm here wearing an ironed shirt. Okay, I know I made a mistake... ...but how can I be responsible if you imagine things? I'm not educated or intelligent like you. So, I can't think of cheating anyone like you. What are you doing? I had decided you'll be my wife and mother of my children... ...only after that I told you. You've made me cry. Happy! Buddy, enough! You're drinking too much. I'll drink, what's bothering you? What's it Karuppu? Are you drunk? Why are you here at night? - I wanted to see you, brother. Though I'm drunk, I dared to see you. When I'm happy I can be with anyone. I'll be on my own. But when I'm sad, I wish to be with you only, brother. Okay... why are you sad now? That girl... my love... brother. You told me to take flowers when I go to meet her, brother. - Yes. It seems she doesn't love me. It seems she lied about loving me to discard another man. I feel like crying, brother. Are such girls fit for family? The girl who becomes your wife will decide how far you'll go in your life. We are nomads who go from place to place for tournaments and agreements. We'll spend half of our lives in fights and getting ready the cocks for fights. This is also a kind of madness. We'll be like this all our lives. The girl who supports us and enjoys this... ...kind of life can only become our life partner. You're right, brother. Hey cousin! Come... why are you coming late? Welcome uncle. Though I've differences with Pettaikaran... ...you've been gracious enough to accept my invitation to attend a function in my home. I'm very happy, brother. Talk to him. Durai, I'll come back in a minute. - Okay brother. Lord Karuppa! Bless prosperity to my family! Take it brother, keep it in home and have it leisurely. I've brought it for you only. You won't ask this after finishing that, right? Don't you know how much he respects you? If he knew you love foreign whisky so much... ...he would've sent you a bottle to your home every day. No... dear... no... that's all, over. I'm getting late, I'm going home. Durai, it seems Ayub is searching a groom for his daughter. Shall we arrange a bike for him? What doesn't he want from me? We don't want anything, brother. You're the best herbal doctor of birds... ...but my boss is sad because people don't know about your greatness... ...Pettaikaran is refusing to compete with us... ...how can you make your livelihood if he restricts to few fights? Your family should also survive, right? Pettaikaran will listen to you. Make him accept for a fight... ...my boss will bear all the marriage expenses of your daughter. Excuse yourself from the day of competition citing marriage work. That's enough. Did you see? He has shown his cheating police mentality. The liquor you gave is still in my body, that's why I'm leaving you easily. If I'm respecting you so much for two pegs of liquor... ...my friendship with Pettaikaran is 40 years old... ...how much respect I should give it? Cock fight is for one who fights face to face... ...for cheats and schemers like you the best profession is pimp. I'll ensure that Pettaikaran never competes with you in a cock fight. I don't know how long my mother will live... ...she's falling sick quite often... ...before she dies, I must win over Pettaikaran atleast once. I shall leave now. I used to be here and he used to be there... ...we used to carry the cock in hands like this. It's gone. Brother, Rathinasamy is here. I'm hungry, serve me biryani. - We are here for you. You wouldn't have faced any trouble had he died after the tournament. You killed him. I'll cut your throat, go away. - Durai! What are you saying? Why are you creating trouble getting drunk? You don't know anything, brother. Why fight in a mourning home? - You take him away. He didn't accept your offer that's why you killed him, right? You killed him! I took him there. All of you listen carefully. All of you listen carefully. - Will you please listen to me? If anything happens to me like this, this police man is responsible for it. Take him away. Nobody must utter a word from now. Take him away. Brother, come. They killed him and joined the mourners like innocents. They cheated me to kill him. Send men from station tonight and... They'll dig the case and we'll be in trouble. Let's leave it. He's our man, he'll be useful someday. We are attacking them weapons and hacking them to death. What do you say? Can you think like that because they're your opponents? Durai, we can't fight and win against him as you think. Because Rathinasamy is a police Inspector. Wealthy too! Pettaikaran is just a simple man. The only name I've is that I never made money in this. Ayub too struggled a lot with me for getting this reputation. He too didn't make money. Look at this home, he has two daughters. We must help them. if at all our cocks fly in the tournament, it must be named after Ayub only. Let's give a big part of the collection to the bereaved family. Rathinasamy must give the permission to run a tournament in our area. We didn't agree for a challenge with him... ...would he give us permission to run tournament? We must make him agree. You tried to buy Ayub for this, right? I'm going to run a tournament on his name... ...if you've guts, grant me permission. - What's going on there? Please don't beat me sir. - I can't grant permission. You refuse for an agreement with us. Should I grant permission to you to run a tournament? If at all my cock fights in a competition... ...it'll be in the tournament run on Ayub's name. You said I'm refusing for a fight. Grant me permission. Let's fight it out in the witness of all Tamil Nadu. If you've guts, try to win. Do you've that courage? I don't need to fear anyone for anything. You're afraid of losing without Ayub. That's why you want to conduct a tournament and settle down in life. What you couldn't achieve in the arena... ...you've made me do it when I came to you alone. I'm telling you now... ...if you grant permission and come with all your fighter cocks... ...I'll take on your every challenge for a fight. If you win over me even in one fight... ...I'll tonsure my head there, shave my moustache... ...I'll fall at your feet and quit cock fight forever. If you can't win, will you do the same for me? Competition is equal to life. What do you say? Sir! Grant permission for his tournament. - Okay sir. If his cock wins over my cock even in one fight... ...I'll shave my head and moustache there... ...fall at his feet... ...and quit cock fights forever, that's what I've staked this time. Don't you've any sense of what to bet? What's this... If you've any respect for me, allow me to join the arena. We are going to organise a tournament... ...meet Rathinasamy and make peace with him... ...if not he'll keep on troubling us. - I'll do as you say, brother. We must get things done without attracting his direct enmity. Let's get cocks from Bangalore Ramachandran. All his cocks won the tournament in Thanjavur. Talk to him. - No need of those two. Let's take this one. - Claw is weak. I don't have money to get ready the cock. Ask from her. Why should I give him man? It seems she doesn't have Rs.2000. I went after her and didn't take good care of the cock... ...so she must pay for it. - I don't have money. Hey, look! I've to pay my fee. You cheated me by lying about loving me, right? This is fine for that. Buddy, I think you'll get many more things using this. Brother told you to cut the cock that day itself... ...now we are getting it ready for fight. Did you see how those beggars laughed at cocks? We must get the cock to fight and win the competition. Hello... mic testing... 1, 2, 3... hello... Why is it jarring? You're giving faulty mics. Expert in cockfights in Madurai district, our respected uncle Late Ayub... ...in whose honour Pettaikaran is organising this tournament... ...Ayub Memorial Cup... ...organising committee is honoured to welcome you all to the tournament... ...register your cocks for the competition by paying Rs.400... ...one registration will get you 3 biryani tokens... ...this tournament follows the rules... ...and regulations as laid by the South Cockfight... ...the fight duration will be one hour, four rounds of 15 minutes each... ...15 minutes rest time for each round... ...if cock crosses the boundary, it's taken as lost... ...if the beak touches the earth, it's taken as lost... ...if cock dies in the arena, it's taken as lost. Umpire's decision is final. Winning cocks will be presented with bumper prizes. Cup will also be presented to best cock... It'll stand with temper. Our cock's one shot is equal to 10 shots of opponents cock. If they find about using English drugs, we'll be in trouble. I know that, you keep quiet and carry on your work. Brother, the sizes are perfect. Police Superintendent Akkini Raja and Thulasiannan... ...father of Madurai cockfights... ...will initiate the first cock fight. - Get me a soda. Look at the effect of English drugs. - Yes brother. I think we need to give water to it. Police are refusing permission to organise such tournaments. He wins the fight. To honour our departed uncle Ayub... ...we made pleas to SP and Collector to get permission to run this tournament. Without creating any trouble... - I thought it'll stand the onslaught. They've given English drugs, if not it can't stand this onslaught. Do they think we are fools? If we create problem for this, they'll think we are in the fear of losing. Whatever it is, their cocks are very strong... ...they take on face to face without backing off. Give it fast, clean the beak. Give it. Go for the kill. Let me see who will get ready the cock for the fight without Ayub. Cock has crossed the boundary. Pettaikaran's cock wins. Pettaikaran's cock wins again. Pettiakaran's cocks have won over all the cocks of Rathinasamy. Pettaikaran is asking is there no cock to challenge. Three only, we've booked. Hello sir! Hi! Get the other cage quickly. - Careful. Go away, is it fun to watch? Go away please. Move. Welcome. - Hello, sir. Tell them to come now. All the three are high bred, we must be careful, brother. You don't worry, I'm sure it can't win. If we have an inch smaller, we can win. Tell him to bring that one. - Okay brother. Brother wants you to bring your cock. There's meaning if we've a cock like what you said. There's one, brother. One that got selected for tournament. One that ran away before fight started. I told you to cut it the same day. No brother, I... - Did I tell you to cut it or not? No brother, if you see it now, you'll not get tensed, brother. Get that cock. What am I asking you? What are you trying to show me? Give me the cock. - Is it going to fight now? I'll also come, brother. - I'll take you as soon as competitor joins. Brother, see the cock now. Do you think I can't judge a cock's capacity looking at it once? Not like that, brother. Leave it, don't harp on the same thing to irritate me. When he brings the cock, cut it. No brother. Will it be okay, Durai? Height is okay, brother but don't how it'll manage. Didn't you see it fight last time? How did it won? Bangalore cock won't give much time... ...it must finish immediately after the first break. This cock will not hold. Brother, hold this cock once. Ask him, will he cut the cock or shall I do it myself? Talking to me as if he knows everything. What happened buddy? I wish he had seen it once. Bangalore cock will surely win. If I tell brother is getting angry. Hello. - Hi, this is Irene. Who is it? - It's Irene. I don't want ice. We promised to repay today, she's abusing me in English. That's why I warned you, such girls won't match you. She's asking you to repay. Had it been Nagavalli... Nicholas. Hello. - Hello, I'm Nicholas here. Tell me. You promised to repay Irene's money today evening, right? Hello... - Hello... hello? Hello... - Can you hear me? What man? - Not you... go. Yes. - Hold on a second. Wait man, I'm talking to you, why are you giving the phone to her? Hello. Tell me. I just want to check for the money... - I don't get you. Today is the last day to pay the fees. Hello... hello... - Hello, I can hear you. I can't... hear... you... properly... Hello... - Call... you... later... Hello... Find any competitor for Rs. 1000. Whose cock is this? - Why? To fight. Why else? Get your cock. - Rs. 1000 bet. You can see the cock if it's okay. I can see Rajini by paying Rs.50 for a CD, do you need Rs.1000 to see your cock? Aren't you from Pettaikaran's group? Do you want me to fight with your cock and go home penny less? Looks like you're searching too hard for a competitor. Won't you invite us? - You're very bold. You've lost 11 fights since morning. Yet you want for more fights. You saw the cocks from Bangalore, do you accept our challenge? I'm ready to bet anything. They're asking if Pettiakaran's group has challengers for Bangalore cocks. We want them to bring their cocks immediately. Have you ever done anything against me till now? Still thinking about it, brother? They're asking for challengers. Answer me. He has no respect for me. Nothing like that, brother. Young boy, he raised it, for that love he defied your order. Has my honour become a play for you? What are you watching her? Go! Pettaikaran's name is giving shivers to everyone here. Veeramani is ready to accept challenge. No need to ask for trouble. Is it the cock that will win over Pettaikaran? It's not an ordinary, won't fight for nothing. Brother! What do you want now brother? Is it okay if he cuts the cock before your eyes? Tell me, brother. In the cockpit 8, Pettaikaran group's Karuppu's cock... ...will fight with Rathinasamy's Bangalore Ramachandran's cock. Buddy, they've come from Bangalore to give us Rs.1000 we need badly. You mustn't speak, the cock must do it. Cock can't speak. But it knows to kill. Move. What are you doing? Leave the arena with your cock. - Brother, no... I said leave the arena. Karuppu, come out. Then, accept defeat and leave. - No way. Fight hasn't started, you want me to accept defeat. Leave it buddy, they'll win only in fight less competitions. The fight has been stopped before the start, right? Yes. Then, tell him to go. No way, he has challenged and the fight must go on. If not accept defeat and leave the arena. Why would this cock lose? That cock will lose that's why I stopped the fight before it started. Brother, this cock will win easily. Are you teaching me about winning cocks? You're tensed, please listen to me. - Do you want me to listen to you? You said he did play fully, Durai? Did you see? Proud! Arrogance! Everything is poison. He thinks I've grown old. - Why would I say like that, brother? He's saying, isn't he? Our cock is an inch half shorter than it. Why are you letting it fight? Brother, this cock will win the fight easily. It'll hit from side cleanly. What's this Karuppu? Play your drama elsewhere, start the fight first. If not accept defeat and leave the place. Veeramani, I'll break open your head. Are the rules different to you and others? If you think it'll lose, why did you bring to arena then? Let's see which will be loser. That's what I too want, let the cocks fight. Listen... You remember what I've staked, right? Would I let you face humiliation, brother? I can't wait anymore, tell them to accept defeat and leave. Did I bet with you? It's between me and Rathinasamy. Call him. Trying to finish me with a loser from my side. It's not a loser, brother. If you argue with me, I'll cut you also along with it. You've brought a wonder bird and getting angry if I say bad about it. I don't know if it's a wonder cock or not... ...all I know is it'll not lose the fight. Dorai... - I've accepted the challenge. Watch, I'll win hands down. Why are you speaking like that? Then ask others to leave the arena. Let the fight begin. We request the cell phone loser to tell the number and take it. Hello, I'm Pettaikaran here, listen carefully... ...in the arena 8, the man who is challenging and the cock that's fighting... ...I don't have any connection with them... ...I'm announcing if he loses, I'm not responsible for it in any way. Why did you announce like that? - Don't I know? How can it not be? If that boy loses, it means he has lost. Why did he then claim to be from Pettaikaran's group. ...and challenge cock from my group. Tell them in clear terms. That's better my dear. Trying to finish while I relax. Try doing it now. Why are you upset for this? It's just the opening credits only. Take the cock for water. Move... move... Their cock backed off with just two knocks. Why did brother ask to cut this? - Leave it. Why are you talking about it? Arena 51, Kovilpatti Kumar's group... ...R. Sendhil's cock is declared as winner. Can you get the stove atleast? Why did he come here? What have we done to make him so angry? Let's discuss about it later, I've set up another place for you, come. Brother. You can feel later, first get ready the cock. Just 10 minutes only, try for a draw atleast. My cock will win the challenge. - Happy if it wins. Keep the cocks ready that went for water from arena 8... ...Pettaikaran group Karuppu's cock... ...and Rathinasamy group Bangalore Ramachandran's cock... ...must be back in the arena in 2 minutes. Start the fight. Buddy, don't accept Rs.1000 note, it seems fake notes are in circulation... ...take Rs.100 rupee notes only. - Stop talking, let the fight get over. Shut up. - You stay quiet. Let me see if you take money or go with shaven head. People outside the arena keep quiet. Tell them to keep quiet. Keep the cocks ready for next fight. Good shot with legs. I told you I'm in no way connected with that fight. How can I be responsible if he loses? Whatever it is, he's from your group, right? Why are they harping the same thing? Result has come from the arena 8. Rathinasamy group Bangalore Ramachandran's cock... ...has lost to the cock of Pettaikaran group's Karuppu. He has done as he said, brother. - He's very lucky boy. Any trouble he comes out cleanly. Raja. - Yes? Get the boy here. You've raised the cock very well. - Did you call me here to tell this? People know it'll be good if I raise it. But Pettaikaran doesn't know it that you're good. Not a scratch on the cock. - Can it dare touch my cock? You're right, will you accept another challenge? No need, I wanted Rs.1000, so I accepted the challenge. I got the money, that's enough. Your cock is good, you and it will get fame if you let it fight again. Wants to have fun by inciting us. Find another man for it. Scared of losing the money you won. Only loser will get that thought. If you're so confident, accept another challenge. If you lose, pay just one rupee only. Hello, is my cock so cheap to fight for a rupee? If I lose, I'll pay you Rs.10000. You saved me, Lord. He accepted the challenge and gave me tension. Where is he? Is he angry for shouting on him? Nothing like that, brother. Second fight? Super! Let's have in arena 1, we too can watch it. Stop showing teeth and announce it. It's like spinning a coin, we can't win always. It was my good time, I announced I don't have anything to do with him. He too is very lucky boy. Rathinasamy group's Bangalore Ramachandran's cock will fight... ...with Pettaikaran group Karuppu's cock second time... ...those interested to watch come to arena 1. It's unjust Veeramani, were you removed because you're unlucky? Mind your business, last time it won by luck. Do you still trust it? Why are you going over the board? Won't you calm down? He wanted to dig his own ditch. If our cock wins, he'll pay Rs.10000, if it loses, it's enough if we pay one rupee only. Okay, you accepted it but why did you claim to be from Pettaikaran's group? To keep away from problem, brother disowned you publicly. Why don't you also maintain it? If father stops talking, can son change his surname? He has become old and talking mad, why are you also joining him? If I accept as he says, you know what would people say here. ...they'll say Pettaikaran's group has broken into pieces. Stop talking and start the fight. - Wait, I'll. Faster. If you lose and if brother falls at his feet... ...you don't have any problem, right? You too don't say the same thing, brother. My cock will surely win the fight. What else did he say? He has grown old and talking mad... What happened to your sense? He was asking brother Durai. His cock will not win, it won the first time by fluke. Without going after the win, if he accepts second fight, he'll lose. The fight is over in a minute and half. Gone? Didn't I tell you? I'm in this field for 40 years, don't I know it? Karuppu's cock has killed Bangalore Ramachandran's cock. People who saw this classic fight, people who haven't missed a lot. How wonderfully it flew with it's claws wide open! Pettaikaran's breed is always exclusive! Hello Nicholas! Don't over do things man! I can hear you clearly now. Today is the last date to pay fees for her computer classes. Once I promise, I'll always keep it. Then? Call Durai. - Leave it uncle, let's take on them later. Do you want me to fall at his feet? - Why unnecessarily... This time I'll initiate the fight. Once a cock run away from the arena, it'll always run away. Durai, uncle is calling you. How can it fight again? Is it cock or machine? I'll pay whatever he asks. - I don't want anything. I'm confused about how to spend Rs.10000. You want to pay more, nothing else, right? You know my farm, right? - Uncle, why are you staking farm? It has 100 coconut trees. If he wins, tell him I'll give it. Tell him to accept another fight. What's this brother? Who wants your farm? Are you scared of losing? - Scared? Me? We play with dangers just like that in life. We won twice, can't we win the third time also? Then, accept the challenge. Wait. What can he do with a farm, brother? Make it as cash of two or three hundred thousand. I'll make him accept the challenge. - What's this brother? Okay, I'll give three hundred thousands. Tell him to accept. If he loses, tell him to return Rs.10000 only. That's enough. First time in my long experience I'm going to watch third fight. In arena 22... With Rathinasamy group's Bangalore Ramachandran's cock... Pettaikaran is always cool... ...we can pin him down only if we incite boys like Karuppu. The third fight is about to start, I know the excitement all around. But still I request people to stay out of the court. Have you also joined with him, Durai? If he wins, he'll settle down in life... ...if he can't, I'm sure he'll ensure a draw, brother. Shall we go to watch the fight, brother? Start the fight. It's down in the first blow. Don't fold your hands, cock hates this. The entire arena belonged to your cock. Now it's losing ground, losing out. You too have readied your cock with great difficulty... ...you too want to see your cock winning the fight. That's why I asked my brother to take few blows. Ask it to fight now. It has promised to blow up after water interval. Why are you itching to see the death of your cock, Mani? The name... Attack like a lion cub! People outside the arena keep quiet please. Water break. They could've withdrawn, they've spoiled the reputation of the cock. Is it fresh wound? Give me needle and thread. Shall we withdraw? - No chance. Why are you applying spray? If that cock's beak touches our cock, it'll melt away. He has many tricks under his sleeve. You said it'll hit back after water break. Watch out, it'll hit now. Our cock is attacking. We said cock will hit, did we mention whose cock? Just few big strong blows and the cock will give up fight. Will it lose if it crosses the boundary line? Wait boy. How much time is left? - One minute. Thank God! He's trying to pick it up. - Did I touch it? You can't speak here, it's taking rest, stand still please. Run away... He'll lose everything. Water break! He has come to fight with a hen. Hold this, brother. Beat him... - Leave him. He's commenting on cock, brother. Brother, this time I'll die. Your next 15 minutes will stay for another 50 years. Don't give up. Do whatever you want to but don't give up fight. Last water break for the fight in arena 22... ...last round fight is about to start, people outside arena keep quiet. Start the fight. Did you see the killing blow? It's all over for it, brother. It's going to sleep on ground to ride a cycle. It's going to touch the ground. Don't talk nonsense. Say when it really touches. Am I saying it? Look at the cock. Cock is losing. Oh no! Shouldn't the beak touch the ground, brother? Yes, if it touches, we lose. Please don't move. Brother, I think it'll touch the ground. Don't give up brother! Don't give up boy! How much time is left? - Two more minutes. Just two more minutes only, don't give it up boy! Pettaikaran group Karuppu's cock has won! Wonder cock! Brother! Winning the third fight also, Karuppu has brought laurels to Pettaikaran. I'm proud to announce that Karuppu is the next Pettaikaran. Brother, they broke a chair in celebrating victory. Owner will get angry sir. Come tomorrow morning to check accounts and take it. Never in my life I saw such a fight. Karuppu. - Give me. Brother! - It's a big matter. Money doesn't come to home on its own so easily... ...only very few lucky men get it, now it has come to you... ...one of my cousin's bar is up for sub-lease... ...I'll get it for you, you can settle in life. Why are you giving me the money? Give it to brother. If I promise I'll always keep it. I don't change my promises according to situations. Once said I'll keep it at any cost. See, I know it. I understand. I can understand how difficult it is for you. I don't know how to compensate... ...whenever you need money, but within Rs. 5000... ...feel free to ask me, I'll give. You can return whenever you can. We can be friends now. Don't worry. I'll not call like today to torture you. Okay, give me Rs.50 now. Bye. It's gone, honour of generations is gone. Can't show face in public now. Sinner! You lost again! Have you come back lost? Can't show face in public hereafter. What will I do now? He has brought bad name to the family. Brother, want eggs to hatch. - Take it. Can't show face in public... can't show face... Sinner... you've lost! What a useless son I've given birth to! Oh no! He has broken the hatching eggs, it's a bad omen to the family. Enough, stop it... - Oh! He's beating me... He's killing me instead of winning over them. Leave her father. I don't want anymore of enmity or cockfight with them. I want to give up once for all. Don't irritate me. Throw her away! Hello aunt! Is it dry fish gravy? Smells delicious! Take it brother. - What is it? Money. - What money? The money won in the competition. Why are you giving it to me? Give it to your mother. Sendhil, come. I'm going to the town. Why are you talking like that, brother? I've the money I need, don't give me your money and make me a beggar. Will you come back for dinner? - Yes, why did you bring it here? Cock was very dull, so I brought it to you. After getting pounded in the fight, it should've died there. It won and survived by fluke. It may die in my coop, it'll spoil it. Why are you differentiating as mine and your coop, brother? Why is he so angry on you? Don't be so harsh, anyone in his place would behave like that only. Had it been anyone else, he would've taken entire money... ...and given few bucks like crumbs to a dog... 'Next is Karuppu from Pettaikaran team...' He told me to keep everything and says it's my money. Increase the volume. Buddy, you're on TV. Everyone is happy about the victory. The day cockfight is included in the Olympics... Put that TV off, it is disturbing me. Just a minute grandma. I can't bear to see your father like this. All our efforts have gone in vain, uncle. What shall we do now, uncle? We needn't have to do anything. Pettaikaran has lost for the first time. Watch what this feeling of defeat will do now. Enough... nothing mother. No problem mother. Are you drunk? That's boys... I won the competition. They asked for a party. That's why, a few pegs. - Have you started your routine game? Just four pegs only, I said my mother will scold me. All this is for you. Where did you get so much money? The cock you threatened to cut and cook has won this big money as prize. What will you do with so much money? Let's think of what shall we do with it later. First let's keep it here and watch it! Mother... mother... what's this mother? Why are you carrying cans instead of living luxuriously? Should you come here for our range? Why are you spending money unnecessarily? Wear it brother, it happened all because of you. It's nice. Nice shirt. Hi! - Hi! Hey, Nicholas. I saw you on TV last night. You carry on talking. - Did you see? Take it. Do you know how much I won in the tournament with your money? Three hundred thousand. Then, why did you... - Why did I take Rs.50 from you? Only then I can meet you again, right? For that only. No need of all that. You've my number, right? You can call me at any time, Okay? We were loitering aimlessly. Took money from her hands. Took? You plucked from her hands. That's what I'm saying. If plucked money has so much power... ...how powerful it will be if she gives affectionately? If she becomes my life partner, I think my life will reach dizzy heights. I think we'll not even reach home. You're going great guns, but you're ignoring me. What do you want? Tell me, I'll do it. He gave Rs.50000 to Ayub's family... ...he has brought gold bangles worth Rs.19000 for aunt. Super! How much it cost you, Karuppu? Why are you bothered about it? You said it's nice, wear it then. Give this to old man. Did you buy anything for the girl? She said you gave your hand, that's enough. Watch out boy! You may give her something else. How can... - Brother! Hubby, look here... Why are you buying gifts for my wife? Can't I buy for her as token of affection, brother? Am I not here for that? Why are you also doing it? What happened now? Few bucks in the pocket is making people very proud. What... - You go. Brother... - I said go. I'm telling you, get out! Brother! - Pick it and leave. Why are you angry on him? I said my hand... - I'll kick you. Why are you beating her? If you're angry on me, show it on me. Look at him as if he's... Are you such a big man? That I need to show anger which I've on someone else. You! - Sir... Hubby... come back... - Go away! Why are you beating him now? - Are you supporting him? Go away! I let you into home and you're defiling it. Why are you talking like this? - Play your drama elsewhere. Brother, if you ask me to leave, I'll go. Why are you using bad words? Will you wear bangles if he buys it for you? He brought it with affection, what's wrong in it? Why are you unnecessarily furious? - Shut up! Go inside. It seems he brought it, and she's showing it to me. Maari! Brother! Those bangles... do you know the price? I think he said Rs.19000, brother. Take this one. - No brother, I'll take that one. Isn't it for Karaikudi Ganesan? This is will be perfect. If it takes three in the first round... ...if it escapes second round with scratches... Brother, I feel this will be perfect. I'm telling you, this will win the competition. No brother, if you're wrong like that day. Everyone will be embarrassed. Tell him to go. Call that Madras doctor, he wanted cocks to hatch eggs... ...tell him, I'm ready to sell. Hello! - Where are you brother? Why? Brother wants to sell the cocks to Madras doctor. - Why? He asked about the price of bangles you brought for aunt. Okay, leave it, I'll take care. Brother, doctor's nephew is here to take delivery of cocks. He's in Madurai to study. He wants to take it personally. Uncle sent me, he told to pay and take delivery. Rs.20000. - Give it to him. Clean it and give. Don't give it to anyone on the way. - Just sprinkle water on it. - Okay. Till now he never sold the cocks. Take it carefully. - Okay uncle. You claim proudly it won 13 fights. Why are you selling it to strangers? Would we allow such an exclusive breed to reach others' hands? Karuppu sent that boy. He gave money. Do you know who is that boy? Irene's brother. - Is it? Would we allow to go off our hands? - Hubby, come and have lunch. Brother, Karuppu told... He's selling it for money, right? Let's buy ourselves and keep it safely. Return the bird. Return it. Give it. Give it I say! Dear! - No! Tell him I threw it on your face. Trying to embarrass me for trusting you. I feel you did the wrong thing, brother. Manikanta. - Brother. You're ready to sell it to a stranger in Madras... ...why not to one of our boys? What's wrong if he wants our breed shouldn't go out? Don't leave it. - Okay. They're my cocks. I'll sell it to anyone or cook it to eat... ...or else just kill it for fun, nobody has any right to ask. They're taking care of it day and night, right? How can you deny them that right? All of you feel now whatever he says is right. In that case... Brother... please listen to me... Meena. - Yes. Yes? - Tell him to go. I don't like to see him. What happened? - Why are you so angry on me? Shouldn't I tell what I feel is right? What have I done that has made him so angry? Leave it man. This is my cousin's bar I told you about. Well located. If you get it, you can make money. Is it okay to you? - Okay brother. Let's discuss with the owner. I finished the deal last night. I trusted your word and brought him. How can you say like that now? No... Look, he's my younger brother. Will you do it for me or not? I've taken money also. If you do it for him now, it'll be a great help to a struggling man. The party I've settled the deal is powerful. If I change the deal, I can't face them. It'll be an embarrassment to me. - Is it so difficult to talk it out? Please don't mistake me. Okay brother. I've discussed with him. Shall I get the money now? - Don't rush. Let's complete the deal by paying on coming no moon day. Bar means... you mean like a canteen? That's nice. Without wasting money you're investing it, that's good. Is it necessary to run a bar, son? Can't we redeem the mortgaged house with the money? Why? Let's think about it later. Let's buy another bigger house inside the town. This house is enough son, your father lived here. Do you need this autograph now? He has become a big man in just one day. He was after you like a little boy learning the techniques of the trade... Don't add salt to the wounds. This is the beginning, it's the time of that boy. How long we've been in the cockfight business? Did we ever make it to the newspaper headlines? Little boy! After noon he wins the third fight... ...evening he wins the best cock award, and appears on TV news channels by night! They're saying he's the best man in Madurai district. I think you must quit this field. - Why should I quit? I won and made Rathinasamy to quit cockfight. But people say Karuppu made Rathinasamy to quit cockfight. Periyasamy, Rathinasamy is the only man who can match your standards in cockfight. Now he has quit cockfight. If you don't quit now, you may've to compete with young boys. They'll discuss about that tournament only. How you were a hero to my generation, for today's generation, it's Karuppu. If you don't quit, you'll get humiliated. Close the door and sleep inside. Don't think too much and confuse yourself. Now it's 10.30 pm, how this place used to be. Boisterous! I feel lonely! He won once and people are praising him too much. Can people who win by luck become Pettaikaran? Everyone who was with you know that nobody can become like you. More so Karuppu will never think... If he has thought like that would he come to you with entire prize money? Look, you were proved wrong, how much money I've won in prize... ...to show and insult me, he had come with money. Not out of respect as you think. - Why are you talking like this? Whatever he did was to pacify you, but you've taken it wrong. You've misunderstood it. Till now people who took my word as order... ...today they're discussing if I'm right or wrong... ...even Durai too went against me. He's responsible for everything. The same thing happened when Rathinasamy and I left Thulasiannan's camp. All the boys walked out with me. He quit cockfight and started looking after mill. Thulasiannan has family business to fall back... ...but I don't have anything else other than this. This family will run till Pettaikaran is considered as 'No:1' in cockfight. You left everything for me. I don't know if I can keep you well hereafter. I'm worried. I'm happy, you don't confuse yourself. I can't be the old Pettaikaran till Karuppu is in cockfight. One man ran a bar and took care of you so well... ...now our Karuppu is also going to run a bar... ...I met his mother in the ration shop, she told me. First time I saw her smiling. She was wearing new sari, jewels and they're going upwards in life. Watch out, Durai and Karuppu will join together to take care of you well. If you give up your anger a little... Do you want me to beg? Relations and friends! I guess you all know why we have all gathered this evening... ...it's to bid farewell to my nephew Dominic... ...who is leaving for Australia. We wish him God's blessings. And all the best, cheers to him. You said you're going to start business. This is for you. I've made is specially for you. What's their problem? When is Irene leaving, Macky? Actually I'm in two minds now, whether to send her there or not... ...with all these problems there. Here or there, it's all the same for us... ...atleast there our children have better future to fight for. But she feels she belongs here. I'm see know, that hen in the coop. What is he saying? - Who is this bugger, Macky? A friend of ours. - Why do you allow all these men? I know my daughter better than anyone else. What do you do my son? She's asking what do you do? I expected this question that's why I've come prepared. Just repeat what I taught you. I'm cock... flying... - What? - Cock flying? She's got a great... Cock... cock flying? - What is he saying? Roosters... Big? - Yes, very big. Take the son of B out of my sight. I casually talked about cock flying in English... ...I think it shocked her. May be! I expected else for a party. But it's different. Party will be like that only. - But party will be fun. Is it? I've thrown a party to friends for starting a bar and came here, you know that? If you want to go, you're free to go. You've come with me. How can I leave you alone and go? Say you'll also join, let's go. - Okay. You said you'll come with me, shouldn't I take you safely? That's why I held your hand. I'll leave if you say no. In which bar they are drinking? Even if it's Ambani, they'll get only after we leave the place. Hey buddy! Sister-in-law, will you marry our brother? - Go away. Why are you here at this hour? That's okay. What's this? Wait there, I'll come. Brother, she's... - Irene? Photo... - What? Take care, go home early. It was so nice of you to take me around. To be happy, money, status isn't a criteria... ...I've understood after seeing you all. When I was with you, I felt like I was discovering myself newly. Till now I always felt I was missing something in my life. I think it's a sense of belonging that I've been missing. Till now I didn't understand only English... ...now I can't understand even Tamil also. Super! - What? When we went out together and now when you talked to me... ...there was only one thought that was ripping my head... ...shall we kiss? No! We went out together... ...if we kiss, won't it be a good finishing touch? Just because we went together and held hands... ...it doesn't mean we are lovers, okay? What else would you like me to do? - What? Nothing. I had a very nice time. Bye. - Bye. Karuppu... Get up! Look, who is here to meet you! Brother, please come in. I told you not to enter my home in anger, will you stop coming for that? Nothing like that brother. I was little busy. Durai has arranged a bar on lease. Happy to hear it. Promised to pay him on no moon day. Mother says no need of it. I'm scared she may repay the loan. Till then, keep it safely with your aunt. Give only if Karuppu comes. - Okay. I'm happy brother cooled down and met me. I told about your business with my father. You know this, this bar thing... He feels it's little wrong. What's wrong in it? He asked if you're interested for a lease of Railway canteen. We freely advice Ambani too. We don't need anyone's advice. I too feel little embarrassed to say you run a bar. Just because you feel embarrassed, I can't change my profession. Why are you harsh on me? Giving me idea, I'll run bar only. It's your money, your life. Do as you wish. What rights do I've to talk about it? Do I look like a fool to you? That girl's father is TTR with Railways, wants his son-in-law... I forced him to cancel a deal for you. You too were with you then, right? Now you come and say no. Would he trust me in future? Won't he feel embarrassed to say my son-in-law runs a bar? Won't it be proud to tell son-in-law runs a canteen in Madurai station? That's why I changed my decision. I agreed because of Marcus. DRM is going out of station tonight, I think it's better to pay today itself. You know Marcus. - Yes sir, no problem sir. What happened, buddy? - It's done. Hello! - Hello brother, came to meet Railway PRO... ...he asked to get money, for lease to run a canteen in junction. Happy to hear it. They want me to pay money right now. I'll be happy if you bring it yourself and pay them. Is he a good man? - Irene's father is with us. He'll do only good for us, right? Okay, I'll come. - Okay brother. Mother couldn't believe it, she was very happy. Won't she be? - Brother, if you go to station hereafter... ...you can have free coffees and cool drinks... ...I've told him to give you for free. It seems my son will name the canteen after me. If allowed looks like your son will name the station after you. I'm planning to pay monthly installments to redeem the house. I think hereafter everything will be fine. Still here? He called you long back. - I know. Go, get the money. Shall I go to his house? Irene. Tell me. - Is it done? Brother is coming with money. What man? How long will it take? He's on the way, just 10 minutes only. Can you identify him? I'm asking you, answer me. It was dark. I couldn't see anything. Even if he had seen, by the time we find him, he would've spent the money. Once money is lost, we can't get it back. Why does it always happen to us only? God is also not on our side. When did streets turn deserted at 7 pm? It seems he went and someone hit him and snatched the money. Something's fishy, buddy. I think he has taken the money, buddy. I think... - You! What's this man? Can't you drink and leave quietly? What's the problem? Why did you beat me? You beat me for that man... Beat me... come on beat me... - I'm vexed. I'll not consider anyone. - Won't you consider anyone? For being with all these years... You're unable to understand. It's fishy, buddy. Fighting again? Allow me to finish talking. - Go man... go... I'm telling you. You don't worry, let's catch the robber where ever he may be. You wished to come up in life with that canteen. I spoiled your chances. Didn't I? - Nothing like that brother. I don't how am I to break this news to mother. She's dreaming that I'll redeem the house from mortgage. How am I to tell her? What we did is wrong, brother. What we earned in cockfight should've been invested in cockfight. But if we try to invest in bar or canteen, it'll go down the drain like this only. Hereafter nobody would dare to challenge you for a cockfight. Is everyone saying like that? If they don't tell like that, why would Rathinasamy quit cockfight? Hey, you're drunk, go home. If we speak truth, he'll ask us to leave. If you speak too much, I'll break your head. You won once by fluke but boasting like an expert. I'm not boasting, brother. Nobody utters a word after this. I'm sad about losing money. You're irritating me. - What did I say now, brother? Tell him to keep quiet. - You started... If you keep on arguing, you'll end up in a cockfight. That's what I'm going to ask... ...you're boasting so much, right? Come, let's have a fight. No brother. - You've that fear, right? Not fear, brother. You're my elder brother. Why should I get bad name of winning over elder brother? I'll split open your head! - Keep quiet. I should've cut his throat for insulting me in the bar matter. Listen to me boys. Have you decided for a cockfight, right? Bring your cocks here tomorrow, let's tie blades and start the fight. But please don't insist on agreement. Fight means agreement only, brother. He's a big boast, tell him to win over me in a cockfight. I'll accept then that he's indeed great. Okay, brother. As you wish. Let's have it. I thought everything will go on fine. What happened? I thought my son has reformed and will take good care of me... ...if he's destined to clean chicken shit all the life, who can change it? Mother, please don't irritate me. If you scold the cock like this, how can it win the game for us? Are we going to live on it's victories? Do you want me to live like you for next meal only? I'll live for honour. Stop talking, are we qualified to talk about honour? You could've redeemed the house when you'd money, right? But we are keeping quiet hearing his wild abuses, right? You're talking so much now, you should've done that first. What's your grouse now? You want a home, right? Let this agreement get over. I'll fix up some house. Did I spend all my life around this place to leave it now? Karuppu, your father lived with me here... ...and we had you as son here, and he died here. When he brought me here as new bride, this was the only house with roof... ...people used to call me as daughter-in-law of big house. You're driving me crazy mother. Stop this boredom. Your father used to carry you on his shoulders while going out. Don't you remember all that, son? I don't want to remember anything, that's why I don't want this house. What did your husband do for me? He spent all the money his father gave on drinks and concubines... ...and left you on streets... ...father isn't someone who sleeps with mother to have children... ...he's father one who teaches the child to face this world bravely. Quit this cockfight. You spend all the time with him with these cocks, so unable to work... If you don't stop talking now, I'll strangle your neck. You'll not understand what I'm saying now... - Mother! If you want mother, quit cockfight immediately, son. Brother! What? Karuppu asked if you can cancel the agreement. - Why? Mother is dead. Okay. After that... After that, I didn't know what happened. She was watching me for long time. I think she knew the end was near. Who will bear the cost of making bier? - We must bear it. Okay, I'll inform them. - Be careful. Kanji, Vaalimuthu, hurry up. Are they coming to mourn? They are coming grandly. I couldn't believe when Anbu told me, who is there for him now? Don't force agreement in few days. - What's this brother? If we think from one side, everything happens in life as fate decides. You both are fighting now. Had you fought each other? It would've lead to problems for everyone. To stop it from happening that, this death has occurred. Suppose if this agreement has been through, suppose you'd lost the fight, it would've been insult to you, right? Why would I lose, brother? I've been living with cocks from the age of ten. Don't I know how to raise cocks and how to win a cockfight? You run a bar and make money. He spent time with me and learnt the trade. It's not so easy to win over him in a cockfight. Let's see! - Listen to me. He must agree to fight on the date and time fixed by me. If not why the hell did he agree for a cockfight with me? Okay, let's do as you wish, brother. You too may face similar situation, I'll also talk tough like you. Let's see. I'll send food for him, come. - I'll come. Buddy, aunt has called for food, I'll get it. I didn't realise how important mother is to life till she was alive. I'll come home at 2 or 3 am. She wakes up sleepily and serves me food... ...and keeps watching as I eat. Hereafter my mother will not be at home to wait for me. Sometimes I drink too much, to keep my intestines safe... ...mother used to serve greens atleast thrice a week. Suddenly I felt she was calling me. I feel like my mother is all over the place. My heart is not willing to accept she's no more. When I'm thinking so much of my mother without much love... ...how much my mother would think of my father whom she loved so dearly... ...I should've redeemed the house when I had money... ...she would've been happy, just in one evening, my life has turned upside down. I don't know why did all this happen to me? Last night I chided mother and raised hand to beat her. Mother, what I did was wrong, I'll never do that again... ...please forgive me, I wish to tell her... ...with whom should I tell this now? All my life what I want to tell my mother, I can never tell her. Don't cry, please. Don't think you're alone. I'm always there for you. Selva, switch on the light. - Okay brother. Hubby! - What? Durai on line. Brother! - Tell me. They poisoned all my birds. - What are you saying? All the cocks are dead, brother. Do you know how pathetic it's to see the coop? How can anyone enter your home to poison the birds? Didn't the dogs bark? No, when I woke today morning, went to see the coop, all the birds are dead. Then, someone who is familiar to your home would've poisoned the birds. Yes, I think. - Do you think it's Karuppu? I think that idiot would've done it. He said I too can face same situation, he has done it. I'll have him arrested and lynched in station. Whatever it is, let's deal it between us, keep the police out. You've done so much for him, you've every right. You've the right to kill him also. - Why are you talking like that? What did I say? - He's our Karuppu. He wouldn't do anything... Can't you take it if I abuse him? Always thinking about him. Why are you talking indifferently? Talking about him while sleeping with me also. Is it because you sleep with him also? Sinner! Were you nursing such thoughts about me till now? I'll kill you. - Move away. Don't shout - I left my parents for you. Trusting you as my life partner. You've ruined my life. Don't shout in public. Let's discuss inside the home. I'll not live with you anymore. I'm going. Will you go away? I'll kill you. Kill me. - Go inside. You'll get ruined. You'll disintegrate. You left me on street to cry. - Go inside. Don't create a scene in public. - Take your hands off me. Go inside. - No, you may poison me to death. I'll not come. - Go inside. I'm going. - Where will you go leaving me? I'll go somewhere. Why on earth him, Irene? Why not him, dad? - What's wrong with you? Why do you do this to yourself? He's got nothing to do with our family. But dad, you only tried to get his business started. You said he's your friend. That's why I did that. That doesn't mean you can... - Daddy, he's got nobody now. I'm all he has. And I'm sure I'll be happy with him. You can't child. Right now you are not able to see it. You can never be happy with him Look Irene, if you want me to look a fool infront of all my friends and relations. She's refusing to go back to her home. That's why brother, so decided to marry, you must conduct it. How can you come suddenly and ask me to arrange marriage? If her family goes to police with complaint. I'm a major. Karuppu! Case will not stand against me. - Come here. What's the matter, sir? Will you come only if we tell the matter? Come. Wait sir, what's the matter, sir? Sir, take your hands off me. Ladies are here. Rogue who organises cockfights, will you be a good man? Aren't these women respectable? What are you watching fun? Clear out. You poisoned the cocks and acting innocence. Sir, I'm innocent. Sir... Sir... sir... no sir... she's watching me... You've committed the crime and expect honour. I don't like to fight with brother, trust me I didn't do anything. You go ahead sir, I'll come to the station, sir. Sir... sir... I'll inform her and come. - Start the vehicle. Are you worried that he has left you in a strange place with a stranger? No... no... He has told me about you. About me? He would've told about my wife. She likes him very much. Apart from the sleeping time, he spends all the day here. When I go out of station, he sleeps here for her safety. You've come to my home for the first time, I'm unable to offer you a coffee also. She got angry on me and left to her parents' home. She's younger to me by 28 years. She fell in love and married me. Just love in heart will not be enough to run a family. Though I'm affectionate on her, though I strive hard to fulfill her wishes... ...I think she wanted a partner of her age... ...that boy was always here only... ...I saw them together one day, there's no life to me without her... ...I beg you, please go away from here with him... ...go very far away from here, let me atleast live peacefully with her... ...that's good for you, my wife will be with me... ...please go away, go away. Grandma! I've seen a lot of our girls run away with other boys... ...I can tell you sweetheart, none of them are happy. It is two different worlds, Irene. It could never become one. I'm tired of all your work, child. Come on now... ...I'm going to take you straight away to your damn aunt's place in Chennai. It's enough if you ask Durai to withdraw the case... ...I'll take care of it. Hey! Go home straight. Don't go anywhere else. If Durai sees, you'll be in trouble. Did they beat severely, buddy? - No, it's hurting too much. Let's go to the hospital. Let's go to brother's house, she'll be worried. Seeing police whisking you away, she cried for long time, I tried to pacify her but she didn't listen to me... ...little later she got up, wiped the tears and left home. 'The number you're calling is...' 'Please dial after...' It says switched off, brother. Was she crying for long time? - Yes. She came leaving home for me, just for me. I couldn't take care of her, brother. She left her home, don't know where is she and what happened to her. I feel like I've lost everything. Forget her, the girl who leaves you in distress, let her go to hell. Forget her. That's better for you. Can't find fault with her, brother. She came for me and police whisked me away, she'll get worried, right? If Durai withdraws the case, she'll know I didn't do anything. I'll meet Durai now. If you meet him now, it'll lead to more problems. Go underground for sometime. That's good for you. If I go away now, he'll think I poisoned those birds. Do I need it? I must make him understand I didn't do it. I'll meet him. He's already furious to kill you. He'll be drunk now. If you go now, you'll be in trouble. I'll take care of it, brother. - Wait a minute. Keep this. - Why do I need it, brother? Keep it for safety. No... no... - Keep it. Take it. Hello! Where are you now, Durai? - In home. Are the boys with you? No. Mother has gone out. Brother and boys are in the shop. Tell them to come home immediately. - Why brother? Karuppu is coming there with vengeance. Let him come, I'll take care of him. He's coming with weapon, be careful. Her brother's phone is ringing, he's not picking it up. Then call Nicholas... - What did you drop down now? Nothing... Call Nicholas and ask him to go there. What? I want to talk to you for few minutes. What do you want to talk about? Come in. How long you know me? Aren't you seeing me since I was a kid? I accept I went little overboard that day getting drunk. How can you think I'll poison your birds for that? Tell me brother. Do I look like a man who will poison birds? Okay, you're very affectionate, tell me why are you here? You said I'm your younger brother. That's why you dug a ditch for me. - I didn't do it brother. I was humiliated by police whisking me away as she watched. I don't know what did she think about me. She'll believe only if you come and tell her. You! Why are you standing here? I came here with Karuppu. What are you doing here at this hour? Ask your brother, he called me here. Didn't have any fight, right? - Wait. Get going. - Catch them. Kill those boys! Go boys! Dad! Hello. Karuppu, she's in serious condition after cutting the nerve. - Why? Don't know why. Couldn't speak to her brother. Just now got her admitted to a hospital. Which hospital? Turn the cycle. The problem has blown into big. - I'm sure they'll kill us. Hello! Hello brother, I'm in deep trouble. Neither can I to go hospital nor... - It's not good to see her in hospital. Forget her, where are you now? I'll find a safe place in town and... No, if they find you and you've a fight, it'll become a big problem. Go to the temple of Nondisamy where we ran the tournament. I'll talk to Durai and clear his doubts. You can come to town after that. Okay brother. Buddy, you go to hospital and tell me her condition. Brother told me to go the temple of Nondisamy. I'll go there. How much I've done to him? How dare he tries to kill me. If I spare him because of you... Hello... Where are you now, Durai? I'll send my brother and boys there immediately. Father threatened to take her to Madras immediately... ...if she refuses, he said he'll take her by force. She said she'll not come leaving Karuppu here. But father didn't listen to her. She closed her room and cut her hand. She asked let me see where will you take me to Madras or hospital? Give the phone to him. Brother. - Tell me buddy. Nothing to worry, right? - I think nothing to worry. Give the phone to her and tell her to speak to me. Okay buddy. Ula wants to talk to you. Karuppu is out from station. Brother has sent him out on work, he'll finish it and come back. Tell him not to go there. Hello! - Irene! Why did you do like that? What if anything had happened to you? Forget it. Don't go the place he told you. - Why? Please don't give the phone to the patient. He said many bad things about you. I think he hates you. Are you trying to escape after stabbing brother? I'll not spare you alive. Boys, get down and finish him. What? You cut the line. Run over him! You get the boys. Brother... brother... brother... How dare you come to my home with a weapon to kill me? He hates when people praise you, he's jealous of your popularity. I think he hates you. I spoke to the doctor, Ma. He said she can travel. Be careful Marky. Brother! Send boys to every place he goes. - Okay brother. I'm going to drop Ma and get a cab. Stay by your sister until then. Durai is asking why did I come to him with a weapon? I didn't have a knife when I entered his home. How can he ask me then? You gave the knife and I took it. How did he come to know about it, brother? Answer me, brother. Answer me, brother! How did he come to know about it? Ula doesn't know about you giving me a knife. He couldn't have told him. Then, who told him? Why did you make me fight Durai, brother? Did he expect he'll kill me? Stab me, brother... stab me yourself. Come... come... Go brother! Why brother? It's all your money, brother. I gave it to you myself. You refused then but why now? If you'd taken it then, my mother wouldn't have desired. She was very happy that her son will settle in life. When she realized it'll not happen, she couldn't bear it. I didn't let her to have a peaceful death as a son. Look, I don't like what you do, die, had you ordered, I would've died. Why did you do this to me, brother? If people come to know this, it'll be a great insult. You wanted to kill me. That's okay. Poor girl! What did she do to you? What if she had died? Many people had seen me coming here... ...if I go out alive, they'll ask me, why did I chase Pettaikaran? What am I to tell them? Stab me brother... stab me. I didn't expect all this to happen, brother. If I had I would've cut the cock when you ordered me. Atleast I wouldn't have let it fight in the tournament. Do you hate me so much, brother? I didn't do anything, brother. I never felt sad of not having a father, brother. I always considered you as my father... Brother! You go, check in the house. What happened, brother? It's blood all over the place. - Move! What? - He's escaping! He killed Pettaikaran and escaped, brother. I'm coming there immediately. Action against the spurious drugs, two Govt. doctors have been arrested. Investigation is on. For Sun news, R S Sendhil Kumar from Madurai. Buddy, her father planned to take her to Madras from hospital. She has left without informing them. We are coming there. Buddy, I'm in deep trouble. What happened? Tell her to go back. Tell her to go back to her home. What happened? - Nothing. Buddy, tell that yourself. - Buddy! You've faced many problems because of me. If you come now, you'll face much more problems. Please go away. I told you I'll always be with you. Come what may, I'll always be with you. Brother, called police. Brother supported us in this problem, that's why he killed him. Buddy, no. If you go away now, they'll think you killed him. Nobody must know what did he do. More so to aunt and brother Durai. - Okay buddy. Where ever he may be hiding, we mustn't spare him alive. Do you how everyone respected him? I can prove myself innocent if I stay back here, but how? I can prove only by revealing what Pettaikaran did to me. No! Please redeem the mortgaged house. Mother look! What a big cup your son has won! Brother! - Brother! Let this go away with us! Let Pettaikaran be in death as he was alive.
