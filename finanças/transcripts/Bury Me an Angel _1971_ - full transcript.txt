Well-- [Bernice] Has she showed any reaction? Nothing. Just tinkers with that bike. [Bernice] Just isn't right, Annie. Who knows what's right? I married Arnold, the kids were just little. There mama had run off and my Davis had been dead for a year. Thought I was doing right. [Bernice] You were. We had good times in those days. Arnold worked pretty hard, but he'd find time to take us to picnics up to Crystal Lake. (laughs) Kids loved it. We were so close in those days. Then Arnold died. (sighs) And the kids grew distant with me, in a world of their own. And then Danny going like that. Dag's completely shut off now. Like it's all been my fault. That's silly talk, if it hadn't been for you, those kids wouldn't have had anything. I don't know, maybe I offended God some way. (door rattles) Hello Dag. (phone clicking) (whirring) Hi Bernie, Dag. Yeah, okay. Hey remember that carburetor I laid on you a while back? Yeah, well I need it. Can you bring it over? Well now if you can. Okay, I'll be out back. (phone clatters) Hello Dag. Hi Bernice. (door rattles) Just know something's in her. Of what? That's what scares me. Not knowing. (gentle, jazzy music) Thanks, Bernie. What are you doing? Getting ready. For what? I don't know yet. You going on a put? Maybe. Can I go with? Well maybe, I don't know yet. I'll let you know, Bernie. Uh, I wanna go with. Oh I said I'd let you know. Hey Dag, will you look at me? (water gurgling) [Announcer] You have just won the jackpot and now I crown you Mr. And Mrs. America. You will spend four glorious weeks touring this grand America, staying at all of the best places and flying first class! And that's not all, folks, we want you to have a good time, so here's a check in the amount of $5,000. How about that? (audience applauding) (cheering) That should buy a lot of wonderful memories, wouldn't you say, Mrs. Sanders? And remember, if you're an American, living in America, you're a winner, everyone's a win-- (gentle, quiet music) (water trickling) (distorted, twangy music) (gentle, quiet music) (distorted, eerie music) (gentle, quiet music) (door clatters) (gentle, quiet music) (zipper buzzes) (gentle, quiet music) Dag, Dag, Dag you awake? Go on Lester, I'll catch up, go on. Shh, me and Lester are going off to sleep with the Liberty Bell. You've got to cover for me, okay? And don't tell Annie. He'll catch you, he'll put you in jail, Denny. No they won't, me and Lester's got it all figured out. Just don't tell Annie. (gentle, quiet music) (crickets chirping) (blankest swishing) (gentle, quiet music) Dag, don't be upset, it wasn't my fault. Jaime wouldn't give me the marbles. It ain't may fault he's stingy. Don't cry, okay? Here, I got a special one for you, the best one he had. See, it's special for you. Annie don't have to know. It'll be our secret, okay? (gentle, quiet music) Annie wouldn't understand. (gentle, distorted music) We don't want Annie to feel bad 'cause she can't afford to buy us stuff, do we? (gentle, distorted music) Tell you what, let's hide these things in your room. She snoops in mine. Okay? You're a great sister, Dag. I love you. (echoing) (gentle, distorted music) I love you. (echoing) I stole it for you, Dag. For you. (echoing) (gentle, dramatic music) (gentle, guitar music) (upbeat, dramatic music) (tires screech) (knocking at the door) Dag? Dag, it's me, Bernie. (knocking at the door) Hey Dag, come on, open up. You alone? Just me, Dag, and Jonesy. Just old Jonesy, Dag. Come on Dag, open up. (door rumbling) (pattering footsteps) (door rumbling) Thanks. - Well-- - Hey, ain't that the bike-- That's the bike that Dennis gave me. I guess you got something figured out, huh? Well I guess so. How you gonna find him? Track him. How? Well any way I can. I guess me and Jonesy better go along. I don't need anybody along. Nobody said you did. Any reason why we can't go? Denny'd want us to. (claps arm) I'm going. Me too. Well suit yourselves. Far out, I can be ready anytime. Dag? You know what this guy looks like? Yeah, I know. He's about 5'10", sort of on the thin side and has a nervous walk, long, dark hair. You know him? No. I'd know the cat if I'd seen him though. 'Bout you guys? (distant traffic humming) No. Guess not. Sorry Dag. Yeah sure, thank you. (man laughing) What do you want, Weasel? I hear you been looking and asking-- If you've got something to say, just say it right now. I got something to say, what I wanna know is uh, what you got to give me for it? Look, you little ass, I'm not gonna fool around with you! Hey, cool it, cool it man, put me down. I was just putting you on a little. Uh huh. Wow man, you sure got no sense of humor. Well just none whatsoever, so just, who's the guy? I don't know. (Dag mutters) Wait, wait, I don't know, but there's a guy Denny used to hang around with. He knows everybody, everybody has to abide, he'll know-- What's his name? Preacher, he lives down at Dead End Street, by the hot dog stand everybody goes to. Thank you, Weasel. (Weasel exhales) (dramatic, jazzy music) (engine rumbling) I'm looking for a guy called Preacher. I guess you'd be looking for me. Name's Peaceful Preacher, though folks seem to forget the first part. Well I'm Dag Bandy, Dennis Bandy's sister. Sit down. Feeling weird all day, kinda heavy. I guess I knew you'd be coming by. Well there's some things that I wanna know and uh, Weasel said that you'd know the answers. Everybody wants to know the answers, but just your own, not the ones I'll give ya. What do you mean? Well I answered all your questions before you ask 'em, just to forget it, but that's not the answer you're looking for. You're right, I want my answers. Honey really, forget it. Hunting the man down makes you think of the reasons you're hunting them. It gets to eating at ya. Look, it doesn't matter. Does it matter you have no cause? No cause? You know Denny stole that bike you rode up on. Well I thought you were Dennis' friend. I am, but that doesn't change the truth. The truth, what kind of truth? Come on, let's go inside and talk it over. Come on. (upbeat, dramatic music) (door clatters) (cartoon shenanigans on TV) (phone whirring, clicking) Bernie? Dag. Oh, I've got everything I need now, so if you uh, still wanna tag along, I'm leaving tomorrow morning at 7:00. Okay, don't be late because I'm not waiting. (cartoon shenanigans on TV) (phone clatters) Dag? Yeah? If you've got a minute, I'd like to talk to you. Well I don't. Dag, you're all I've got left. Don't do anything you'll regret. I know how you felt about Denny, but you've just gotta keep on going and do what's best for you. Annie, why don't you ever look at me when you talk to me? You've changed, Dag, it's in your face. It frightens me. So maybe if I don't look, I won't know it's there. Okay, that's fair enough. Dag, it's not your fight. Well it's like you said, Annie, I'm the only one left.

(men laughing) Shut up, Bernie. (Jonesy laughing) [Bernie] What is this? - What man? - I'll go along with your silly game, what? (laughs) I think it's a tampoon, man. [Jonesy] Oh man. Ah, Jesus Christ, it's moving. Kill it, man, kill it! (grunting) (Bernie grunts) Dag? - Yes dear? - I don't want you to feel responsible-- - Oh. - For this, okay? - No. I'm ODing.

Oh, you shouldn't have, Jonesy. (men laughing) What the cornbread hell is going on here anyway? You people ever knock? Well never you mind, officer, you're too late for dinner. Yeah man, we don't give handouts either. [Officer] You punks got any I.D.? I.D., I.D., I.D., I.D., I.D., what's I.D.? He means some identification, something that proves you are who you think you are. (Jonesy laughs) - Right, right, I.D., why didn't you say so? You guys sure talk funny. In my day, all we said was I.D. and that's what you meant, identification-- - Shut up, bush head! God man, you are so rude. My mother wouldn't even dig-- All right, golden locks, let's see yours now, huh? (fire crackling) Dag, huh? (laughs) That's right. [Officer] Well that sure is a funny name. Not really any funnier than Pig. [Officer] You jokers got a permit for that fire? In the desert, you've got to be kidding. [Officer] Listen sister, this is state property with rules and regulations that must be adhered to. Now that means that there ain't no camping outside of designated areas, huh? Oh, well that's really too bad. Um, my bike stopped running on me. Can't see to fix it 'til morning. [Officer] And what in the hell is that? My exhaust pipe. You got a permit for that gun, girlie? No, I stole it off a dead cop. Get off your dead ass and get over yonder and empty them bags for me, ya hear? (fire crackling) Look ass, unless you've got a warrant for that last remark, you'd better leave because I'd just assume you never walked away from here, pig. Now why don't you just go on and get out of here right now? Get your hands off my goddamn hat, you son of a bitch! By God, I'll be back in the morning with my partner and I better not catch you here neither. You bunch of pot headed sons of bitches. Go home. Sorry you had to eat and run, man. Yeah, especially since you didn't even get to eat. (fire crackling) Prick! (men laugh) Hey man, since I scared the pig away, I won the hand of the fair dame, so okay? So you take your pack and you put it over there behind that tree and no peeking. - Oh, all right. Hey man, what the hell? I challenge you-- Oh, right on, Douglas. (Jonesy laughs) (men roughhousing) Hey! [Bernie] Who, us? No, him, you over here. You, over here.

No, we've been riding for a long time and he's just tired. You know Lou, we haven't had any rain in a whole month and that damn ground is harder than hell to dig those damn post holes. How'd you do, hos? Well I done six yesterday, but I'm still waiting for rain. (quiet, upbeat music) (people chattering) (Bernie laughs) (laughs) (claps hands) All right.

Oh, (laughs) well would you remember a stranger if he, you know, were in here recently? [Bartender] I would remember a stranger, yeah. He's about um, 5'10", long dark hair, mustache. We haven't had anybody through here that looks like that in a month. You folks seen anybody 5'10", long hair, mustache? (quiet, upbeat music) There's your answer.

I'm buying her a drink. Hey look, I just ordered the lady a drink, do ya mind? Why not, you buy her a beer, you want my place too? Sure, why not? You.

I don't know if it's right, for real, we're gonna help, do ya hear? (playful muttering) Easy. Oh, look at that, mm. Oh now listen, I want you to take them clothes and I want you to beat them on your favorite rock. All right, Devita, beat, beat! Son of a bitch. (laughs) (Dag shrieks) - Come on, baby. (Jonesy laughing) (Bernie muttering playfully) Come on. (Bernie muttering) [Bernie] Woo! Hallelujah, sister, hallelujah. [Dag] (shrieks) Stop it, stop it! Hey, what's wrong, Dag? Hey Dag!

We've gotta cover more desert area and then after that, ski towns. But, but they'll be empty, it's off-season. Right, and that's probably what he's thinking. He's gotta take a rest before that last haul up to Canada. Canada? That's what the Preacher said. (motorcycles rumble) (upbeat, rock music) (wind howling) (upbeat, rock music) (motorcycles rumbling) (wind howling) (door clattering) (wind howling) Hello. Um, I didn't know anybody lived here. We uh, we didn't mean to break your lock. Course you did, how else could you get in? Now that you're in, you might as well have dinner with me. Well would you mind if we brought the bikes in? It's awfully windy out and uh, the sand'll get in the engines. Of course, uh, you can put them in front of the bar. You can put your gun over there too, that is if it's detachable. Oh, well I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Oh you didn't. I thought maybe you were. I wouldn't want your energy expelled on me by mistake. (wind outside howling) Something's wrong. Good thinking, Jonesy. (wind outside howling) You get much business out here? No. Did you grow up here? No. Well what brought you? Life. That's what makes you uneasy, because I know. Here, put this on the table. (wind outside howling) (fire crackling) (wind howling) What she saying in there? [Dag] It's what she's not saying, man, that broad is really weird. Crazy? [Dag] Yeah. Oh uh, sure smells good. [Jonesy] Uh huh. [Woman] Let's hope it tastes good. (dishes clinking) Thanks. (fire crackling) (wind howling) Thank you. Mm. Hey you know, it does taste good. What's in it? Cannabis sativa. What? [Woman] Grass. Oh. (laughs) I saved a few rolls for smoking. I put the rest in the stew. Do you like it? Yeah, sure. I never had grass stew before. Hey tell me something, what's a chick like you doing out here all by herself? Well what do you care, man? You get lonesome? No. I deal in witchcraft, so um, I came to the desert to find curatives. You mean, you're a witch? Can you tell fortunes? What about tea leaves? My mother used to think she could read tea leaves. I assure you, my powers are real. I'm not the crystal ball type. It's just that I choose to use them in a different way. I work with the spiritual powers of the Universe in much the same way as the Indians do. Can anybody be a witch? No. Because not everyone believes. You think I don't? On the contrary, I think you'd make a good witch. You have strong psychic powers. But first you'd have to get rid of your anger. It's negative. Well what the hell is that supposed to mean? It's so obvious. What's so damned obvious? Your anger. You think vengeance will relieve it, but it won't. In fact, you might find your own guilt is the real cancer. What kind of crap is that? Merely observation. Girl on a bike, the gun, it's terribly phallic. The way you clutch the gun. You're afraid I'll go on, but I won't. Anyway, the fire's dying. (gentle, dramatic music) (wind outside howling) Hey just between uh, just between you and me, you really think you are a witch? I mean, could you prove it? I don't like to be tested. Well skip it. I just thought maybe, uh, you could help me. I could, if I knew more. My uh, my brother was shot down and uh, I saw the man. How's that? - Why was he killed? - For no reason. For no reason, uh, he was crazy maybe, but I saw him. I um, I see him all the time. (quiet, distorted music) I don't uh, I don't have to be dreaming. His uh, his face is always right there. (quiet, distorted music) The blast and um, (crying) the guy is uh, the guy is staring at me. And uh, my brother is laying there, a bunch of goddamn pieces, like he never even existed. (crying) He's just a bunch of pieces, just a bunch of, pieces, all over the floor, like he never even was, and I can't stop seeing it. (crying) I can't stop seeing it and I can't stop feeling it. And now I've gotta kill that, I've gotta kill him because it's all that I can do. Now I have to kill him. (quiet distorted music) (Dag crying) (wind howling) (fire crackling) [Woman] Are you on this death ride out of revenge too? Dag's a friend of mine. I came along for the ride, help out. And you? Was it because of friendship or adventure? Work was a drag anyway, wasn't it? [Dag] Hey Tama, why did you say that? Because he couldn't. He wanted to, but he was afraid it would sound wrong. I just wanted him to know it doesn't. What does matter is that you're all involved in a reality. All you're doing is creating more injustice to lay on top of the heap. Are you ready to pay those kind of dues? [Dag] Yeah, I'm ready. You're ready? You're just about to start living. [Dag] What? Don't you know this hunt is only taking the place of your brother? When he was alive, he was your reason for living. Now this hunt is the reason. That's just about the craziest piece of shit I ever heard, lady. Yeah, I thought you were our friend, lady. [Woman] I am. That's why I'm telling you the truth. Whose truth? The truth that's told by you, seen through your eyes? Well that doesn't make it true for me, man, that kind of crap goes down all the time. Schools, churches, politicians all preach you the absolute truth, but truth depends on what country you live in, how much money you've got and where you buy your facts. I saw my brother die. Now that's the truth. I saw the man's face. Now that's the truth. I feel and my guts are rotting with that truth. You asked for my help, I can only give it. Oh goddammit woman, you're just being evasive. I can only tell you what I know. Well I'll tell you what I know, you're a goddamn phony like every other crystal ball queer. You, you're really full of shit, woman. You come on strong like some hot psychic, but when the big test comes, you just blow a lot of hot air! You talk a good rap, but it's just rap. You were just goofin' on us. Why don't you try some construction around here instead of destroying everything? Are you pulling a number on us, lady? You're just a goddamn fake! A cheap imitation! That creep was probably here last night. She probably balled him. Are you gonna help us or not, lady? I'll bet she dug it too! (yelling over one another) (fire crackling) [Bernie] Dag. (fire crackling) (wind howling) I meant to burn you. You meant for me to feel your pain. I can't. (quiet, gentle music) Keep it, I've got another.

The last time I hung a painting like that, it never sold, remember? They damned near laughed me out of town. You can just take that one back to the school. Well you know, I thought if anybody had class, you'd have class. This is fine art, but I can see you have no class at all, Harry. You don't like that? No, I don't like that. Besides, who said I had class? (motorcycles rumbling) What the hell? [Ken] Now you got customers. [Bernie] Howdy. - Hi. - Hi there. Could I help you folks? Yes, three coffees and one donut, please. One? Well I'll let you have a bite. I'll take it. (dishes clatter) Thank you. Hey, I said one. Look, you can't keep donuts. Well they'll be stale by morning. Far out. Someone might as well eat 'em. Well thank you. You kids just uh, riding through or are you looking for work? Well, we don't know yet. You get many tourists this time of year? Nah, I don't think we'll see anymore tourists 'til the snow falls. Come to think of it, we didn't have much of a summer anyway, it's too cold. Any tourists in last week or so? Yeah, there was this one young guy through here on a motorcycle. I think he said he was heading north. Uh, he had uh, long dark hair with a mustache? He's about uh, 5'10"? Yeah, that sounds like him. Is he uh, a friend of yours? Yeah, we're uh, trying to catch up to him. When was he through? Tuesday. Wednesday. When the hell was that cat? It was Wednesday, came up to the school looking for work. Mr. Armstrong gave him a job over there. [Dag] When did he leave? He hasn't left yet. He's uh, finishing up some art tables for me. [Dag] Think he'll be there tomorrow? Oh, I don't know, tomorrow's Saturday. He'll be there Monday though. Is he a friend of yours? Yeah. You uh, teach at the school? Well just on Friday, art classes only. Well listen uh, I'll tell you what, if you see him, would you do me a favor and uh, don't tell him that you saw us, we're gonna try to surprise him and catch up with him. You on your way to Canada? Yeah, sooner or later, I guess. Bye. Oh, that's okay. [Jonesy] Bye bye. [Dag] Thank you. [Harry] Surely. Hey listen, um, I don't know if you'll be able to find a hotel open. You know, all the lodges are closed until winter. Well we've been sleeping in bags for a week and I'm really getting to love it. Okay, um, if it gets too cold, I live straight down this cross street here, a little cabin on the right by the lake. You're welcome to stay if you'd like. Well thank you, but I'm growing hair on my chest for Canada. (everyone laughs) - Good luck, you'll need it. (Harry laughs) Pretty strange folks, man, I don't know about this place. I'm gonna have to give up the art tour and move on. I think you're right, Ken. (motorcycles rumbling) (birds chirping) Do you know where the principal's office is? That door over there. [Dag] Okay, thank you. But the principal doesn't allow guns on the school grounds. I think he'll let it go this time, okay? This door right here? - Yeah. - Okay. [Girl] You relatives? Uh, yeah. (gentle, dramatic music) Did you see that gun? I wonder what they're gonna do to Mr. Armstrong. I hope they don't hurt him. Me too. She sure looks scary. S'cuse me. Uh, just take a seat and I'll be with you in a moment. (gun thumps) [Dag] I don't have time to wait. Oh my goodness, uh, young lady, I am very sorry but uh, guns are simply not permitted on the school grounds. I'd like to see the principal. Well uh, might I ask your business? Maybe I can help you. Lady, I don't think you could help a cripple across the street. I'd like to see the principal about private business and I don't want any crap from you. (sighs) Well, one simply does not barge in and expect to see the principal. I mean uh, Mr. Armstrong is a very, very, very busy man. Now did you have an appointment? Lady, I think that you'd better tell him he's got company. Now! (sighs) Well, if you will just wait one moment, I will see if he can see you. [Dag] I'll wait 10 seconds. (playful orchestral music) (secretary clatters) What in Heaven's name is going on around here? I have a couple of questions I wanna ask you and I want some straight answers. Like what? You hired a fellow to do some handy work for you Wednesday. Where is he today? I have no intentions of answering anything without some explanation of this outrageous entry. Young lady, and I presume that you are a young lady, your manners and training are atrocious. We try to teach our students here to have a better understanding and acceptance of authority. Look buddy, (principal mutters fearfully) I've come a long way looking for my friend and I'm tired. Now don't give me anymore bullshit. Bull, a friend, well, why didn't you say so? Yes, I did give him a job, but he's not here now. There wasn't enough paint for the hall so he's gonna come back on Monday. Where's he staying? Well goodness, how should I know? All I know is that he left the school last night, heading north. Are you sure he's gonna be back? Well I should say so, he hasn't been paid yet. You don't think he'd work for three days and go away and not come back for his pay? What's up north from the school? Well there's uh, some timber and a few cabins and some turkey ranches. Oh yes, maybe he's up there in one of those abandoned cabins. Oh, you think so? Yes. Well Mr. Armstrong, you're an absolute doll. I wish I had known you when I was young. I bet you've shaped a lot of young minds into your splendid way of thinking, haven't you? Thank you. (playful, orchestral music) (secretary mutters) (shrieks) Oh shut up and call the police. (door clatters) Now what? Wait 'til Monday. How come? We could comb these hills all weekend and never find him, I wanna surprise him the way he did my brother. Yeah but what are we gonna eat? Well Jonesy, there's gotta be a pool table in this town. Well all right. (pattering footsteps) (cheerful music) (Bernie muttering playfully) That'll be 10, sweetheart. (laughs) You sure are something, Dag, I can say that. Hi kids, how'd you make out today? Well everything is just wonderful. We're gonna surprise our friend on Monday and we just picked up some change. Well that's wonderful. What are you gonna have for dinner? Oh let's see, I'll have uh, taco, chili and beans, straight chili, French fries, homemade soup, pie ala mode, fried chicken, cut the mayo. Me too. Uh, got any gravy? Tons of it. Good, I'll have some of that too. Okay, how about you? I'll have steak and eggs, once over easy and coffee, please. Okay. (cheerful music) (door squeaks) - Hi Harry. - Hi. It's really getting cold. Hi. - Howdy. - Hi. - How'd you do inside the school today? (chuckles) Yeah well um, Mr. Armstrong and I had to find our own communication level that we could both relate on and it turned out to be about chest high. Yeah, he is kinda short, isn't he? (Jonesy laughs) You guys ordered yet? - Mmhmm. - Mind if I join you? - Sure. - Sit. Oh, it's getting cold. Hi Ken. [Ken] Hi Bernie, how are you? Did you hear we were at the school today? [Ken] Yeah, I heard about it all day. I don't think those people are ever gonna forget it. Far out, maybe we'll make the yearbook. [Ken] Yeah, maybe. Hi Ken, what'll you have, the special? Uh, yeah, yeah, but forget that special coffee, give me some good coffee. (laughs) Yesterday you were an art teacher, today you're a comedian. I make more money. You eat here a lot? It's the only place to eat, everything else is closed during the summer. Never did learn how to cook. Neither has she. Oh, thank you, Bernie. And I'm really glad you people came through, I was going stir crazy. That's fine, thank you. [Harry] Sure. Where you guys camping? Well, we found a place up by the river today. It wasn't too cold either. Uh yeah, we'd better be getting back, we left some things at camp. [Dag] Yeah, we should. [Ken] Hey well listen, uh, maybe I could show you around town. [Dag] You're kidding, I thought this was it. [Ken] No, it's a beautiful little town, you just have to know where to do. Well I'd really like to, but we should be getting back. We have a lot of stuff back at camp we have to take care of. Well you guys could probably take care of that, couldn't you? Yeah sure. Go ahead, Dag. Okay. - Come on. - Okay, where do we start? We started. Hey Harry, would you put that on my bill, please? I'll pay tomorrow. (door squeaks) (motorcycles rumbling) Why don't you come on in? Well what for? Oh we can have a glass of wine and we can play my gazebo. Is that all? Well that's up to you. (crickets chirping) (gentle, jazzy music) (gentle, distorted, jazzy music) (distorted, dramatic music) Hey wait a minute, wait a minute. Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't, it's me, okay? Don't go, please? Listen, I've gotta go. Don't you understand, man? I don't understand. Well I'm sorry, but I've gotta go. (motorcycle rumbles) (distorted, dramatic music) (motorcycles rumbling) (dramatic music) (pattering footsteps) (dramatic music) I'm going in. If he comes out, kill him. (stutters) Okay. Yeah, I'm going with, you stay here. Jonesy, in case something happens, all right, stay outside. Sure, anything you say. Okay, let's go. (dramatic music) (geese chattering) (distorted, dramatic music) Bernie, split. Go on! (distorted, dramatic music) I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you for my brother! Lady please, look, I can explain that, I (stuttering) I was his sister, man, how do you explain that to me? [Killer] I didn't go there to kill him, I swear to God, I didn't go there to kill him, I just went to scare him. I wanted to get my bike back-- That's no reason to kill someone! I didn't mean to do that, he slammed the door and a gun went off and I just, I didn't mean to kill him, I just wanted the bike back. A lousy, goddamn bike that you killed for, but you'll never see it! I just wanted to get the bike back from him and you know that he stole it, wanted that, he just was gonna get it sooner or later. I uh, I'm just the one that happened to be there-- You're just the one that happened to kill my brother. I haven't, I haven't slept one night, I haven't passed one day that hasn't been filled with your face! My brother was everything in the world to me, and you just walked in and took everything that I had. Do you know how important you've become to me? (gun clicks) - No, please! I don't mean anything to anybody. Please don't, don't kill me. (crying) No. (crying) Well go on then! Go ahead, but you remember this, I know about you and your brother. You got some last little piece of crap to say, buddy? You say it. Yeah, you were sick, you were sick, you and your brother were sick! Say it. Incest! (gun blasting) (glass tinkles) (Jonesy screaming) (gun blasting) No, murder is-- Quiet, Jonesy, goddammit, you're scaring me! (Jonesy sobbing) (door creaks) (Jonesy screaming) (crying) (labored breathing) I've gotta bury him. (gentle, quiet music) (Dag crying) (Dag screams) (gentle, quiet music)
