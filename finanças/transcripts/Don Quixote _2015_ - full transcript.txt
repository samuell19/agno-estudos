Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Father Nicolas! Are you there; What on earth is the matter? Please come at once, Father. He's getting worse. Not so long ago in the village of La Mancha, lived a gentleman who read books of chivalry with so much passion every hour of the day and night that he quite lost his mind. By the golden helmet of Mambrino, I swear to lay you to waste! Freston? Be gone! Spawn of Satan! What are you doing? I was about to slay El Sabio Freston, but his defense is impeccable. I will not underestimate you again. The forces of darkness infest our land like the plague. There is too much injustice, poverty, cruelty. We all do what we can. I must do more. Will the moon be full tonight, father? - I can't wait any longer. - I... I think it will. When the full moon was full and the wind blew from the north, a bold Sir Galahad set forth. What should we do? He hasn't eaten or slept in days. All he does is read those wretched books you gave him. There's no harm in a little literature. These are just some dark clouds passing through his brain. One night when the moon was full, this gentleman had a strange and wonderful idea. Yes! Yes! Uncle! I made you breakfast. Uncle! Wait! Yes! Where are you going? - Yes! - Uncle, stop! - Antonia... - Why didn't you stop him? - Stop who? - My uncle, of course. Oh, I... I brought you these. Antonia. Alonso? Alonso Quixano! Are you addressing me, sir? I am Don Quixote of La Mancha. Don Quixote of La Mancha? Where are you going, my friend? I seek a worthy Lord who will dub me as a knight. He rode out to travel the country in search of adventure. He would punish the guilty, he helped the less fortunate. and become the most noble knight the world has ever seen. A noble knight needs a steed with a noble name. Because you are a strong and valiant creature, I shall call you Rocinante. Rocinante! Come! Rocinante! Look! A castle. My lady. Welcome to El Toboso, Señor. My Lord, I humbly request to rest myself and my horse for the night, in this most majestic of castles. We will provide for your every desire. Fine food, wine, perhaps a tight sheath for your sword. Come on! Take care of this gentleman. I don't pay your mouth to gawk. Virtuous maidens of such class and dignity. - How may I thank you? - Usual method is cash. Tender morsel. I trust the meal was to your satisfaction? Oh! It's fit for a king. We live only to serve you. What's your pleasure now, Señor? I shall not rise from this spot until you grant me what I ask. What's that? My Lord, I beg you to dub me... a knight. You want me to dub you? So that I may roam this world, protecting those in need... heeding the trumpet call of chivalry. This is not a joke? You may use my sword. My Lord, you have made me... the happiest of knights. How may I thank you for this honor? If the happiest of knights could settle his bill, that would be thanks enough. Alas I'm sorry sir it is not customary for knights to carry money. No no. No! A true knight would pay his debts. Inhospitable ruffian. May your castle walls crumble like moulding cake. Are you hurt, Señor? Here. Let me help you up. Dulcinea. What did you say? Dulcinea. That must be your name. For you are truly the sweetest creature in this world. - Where the hell are you, girl? - You must leave at once. My father will be angry if he sees you. My sword. Will you honor me with some token, fair lady? A token? To be reminded of you wherever I roam. - Well, it's only a wash rag, but... - I'd sooner lose a limb... than be parted from such a precious favor. Farewell, Dulcinea. I ride in your honor. For you are truly the mistress of this hapless heart. Good day, Señor. Might you need help with directions? I am Don Quixote of La Mancha. - Okay then. - Do you mock me, sir? No no no no. I'm just drunk. It's a pleasure to meet you, Señor Don. I'm Sancho Panza. Where are you headed? My destination lies in the hands of destiny. My actions guided by a higher purpose... peerless love of Dulcinea Del Toboso. Is she easy on the eyes? Her face is as pale as the summer moon. Her neck, long, as a swan. Its waist, slender as a blade of grass. Slender? That's fine for some people. Me! I like my women bigger. You know? My wife is so big. Sometimes I wish I had a third hand. I tell you, there is no maiden fairer than Dulcinea de Toboso. - Do you deny her beauty? - No no no, of course not, Señor. What I am simply saying is.... one man's passion is another man's poison. Poison? I cannot let this insult pass unpunished. Prepare yourself! Three handed scoundrel. - What? - Charge, Rocinante! Please, I'm a peaceful man. Señor, are you okay? Oh! Señor Quixano! I know that face anywhere. We're from the same village. I'm Don Quixote of La Mancha. Some demon has bewitched my horse. Very well, let's uh... wheel you back to the big house, shall we? - Oh, no. Señor you okay? - Quite all right! We're almost home, Señor. Your family will be grateful that Sancho Panza got you home safely. Do you enjoy covered in manure, Sancho? It's not so bad. It gets me out of the house. If I were home, my Teresa will have me doing chores anyway. Do you never dream of glorious adventures in far away lands? Treasures more precious than any dragon horde? They say impossible dreams bring certain sorrow. And yet dreams fulfilled, lead to certain joy. Me thinks I have need of a squire. - A squire. - Yeah. What's a squire? To be my companion on glorious and chivalrous adventures. - Like a slave? - No, Sancho. No. A squire is to be priced above any slave or servant... for he worth more than twenty ordinary men. Well, okay. I must say, Señor, You are a much better load than any pile of manure I've ever carted. What ever happened? ALS, the good knight fell from his horse, this morning. And I carried him a very long... long way. Are you hurt Uncle? - Miguel, help me. - Yes. Of course. The odour is of a... fine manure. And if I come home without it, my wife would be very very angry. - Can you walk? - Oh I'm all right. Sancho Panza is at your service. I live in a little stone house, with all the laundry and all the kids and a donkey. Oh yes, and my wife Teresa. If you need anything cleaned, She is the best laundress in the province. We have no need of laundering. Thank you. Normally I wouldn't ask anything to help Señor Quixano but you see there is the matter of the manure. I have nothing to show for my long journey. They say virtue is its own reward, but I like to say, a little money is also good. I will pay him. No!... No. I... I insist. For you, it's the least I can do. Thank you, Miguel. - And thank you too, Sancho Panza. - You are welcome. But please, don't breach a word of this to anyone. No no no no. A full pocket is a closed mouth. If the Señor needs anything, he needs his saddle fixed, or his Armour polished or his fine mustache waxed, don't hesitate to call for me. I will... My uncle won't be going on any more adventures for a while. Sancho Panza, I am in your debt. It's me! Oh Sancho! Where is the pig manure? Oh, it's a long story. You have been gone all day. Yes, but... I have this. Did you steal it? No, I didn't steal it. I got it from Señor Quixano. The man from the big house? Yes, and he was talking about maybe giving me more work. We could be rich. Could have other people do our laundry... so you and I could have more time to... kissy, kissy. You stink! Go take a tub. Yes, I do stink. I am a stinky monster. I'm going to smash you to jelly. - Come here! I eat this one. - No! Get down! I eat this one too. What are you doing? - We're going to burn them. - Well that's hardly necessary. What if he'd been seriously hurt? Or killed? - I'd blame you for this. - Me? That's ridiculous. Who brought him all of these? Who came here night after night to cry all about tales of chivalry? If you are so convinced that these books are the root of his madness, - I will exorcise them. - Please, Father. No time for that. We must finish before he wakes up. Young man, as a student you must object to this. It is a little extreme. But under the circumstances... Antonia is right. Burn them all! No! No! My books! - My precious books! - Please don't go! - I will correct this! - Uncle! I can explain. There's no need to explain. It couldn't be more obvious what has happened. - I'm sorry, but I have... - That smell. I would know it anywhere. A dragon. A dragon has devoured my books. His foul fire breathing stench still lingers in the air. A dragon? Of course. El Sabio Freston sent it to destroy my treasures. So you believe this is the work of the infamous sorcerer Freston? Who else could it be? My mission is clear. To seek out this fiendish wizard and his malodorous monster, to vanquish them before they wreak more devastation on the world. My histories have perished. I must fulfill my quest, so that more histories may be written on the glorious adventures of Don Quixote. But you can't leave tonight. There are... There are... There are dragons lurking out there. My child. I do not fear dragons. Of course not. But... But a wise knight would leave on daylight. Quite so. I shall depart on the morrow. Good night Uncle. We'll discuss it in the morning, okay? Yes! Yes! Oh! Yes! Yes! Si, Sancho. Yes! We're going to be rich. You're going to be a grand lady. Oh yes, some lady. Tomorrow I have thirteen orders to wash. What is, what, what is it? What is it? My deep love for you. No! No! There's someone out there. - Sancho Panza! - Oh god! - It's him! - Him.. who? Señor Quixano. See! Told you. Sancho Panza! - Why is he dressed like that? - He thinks he's a knight. - So he's mad? - Maybe. Sancho Panza! What is it, Señor? Are you well? I have come here to hire you as my squire. What is it? Make haste! We leave at once. One second. He wants me to be his squire. What does a squire do? I don't know. But he wants me to leave now. Now? Where to? - He hasn't said. - How much is he going to pay you? One second. Señor, my wife wants to know how much will you be paying me. Tell your wife, a knight does not pay a squire wages. Tell him that only a fool would follow a madman for no pay. Do you want to shovel manure the rest of your life? Or journey with me and gain riches far beyond coinage. Such as? It was the custom of knights errant to make their squires governors of islands and kingdoms they've conquered. I intend to resume that pleasing custom. One second. Yeah, yeah, you know. I heard. What are you going to do with an island? Well, we can leave all this behind. People need to be content in their own station. We are poor. We are always going to be poor. I am happy being poor. I've heard said that "If you do not take advantage of luck when if comes by. You have no right to complain when it passes you". Sancho Panza! I'm sorry, Señor! You will have to find someone else. Sancho! You want to shovel manure the rest of your life? Señor Quixano! Don Quixote. Sancho. I've changed my mind, Señor. I want to join you on your quest. Are you ready for a grand adventure? - Si, Señor. - Follow me, Sancho Panza. Where are we going, Señor? We are in search of a sorcerer and his dragon. Wherever they dwell, that is our destination. - What exactly does a squire do? - Whatever his knight commands. Your first task is to find me a new helmet. Preferably one forged from pure gold. I will do my best, Señor Knight. But you should know, truth be told, I'm not a brave man. Fear not, Sancho. Should we encounter another knight, it is against the code of chivalry for my squire to engage in combat. Good. Unless you're fighting common folk such as yourself. Then you must fight to protect your knight's honor with every sinew in your body. All the bloodletting, limb losing and skull crushing blows of glorious battle, swords, buried in each other's flesh. You are braver than, you know, Sancho. Sancho, do you hear something? It sounds like a poor soul in need of assistance. - I hope someone helps them. - Come! Brave squire. No no no. No! Please not again. That's for my lost sheep. Lay your weapon down! Is this how you do battle, craven knight? With defenseless children? Mount your horse and take up your lance before I run you through. This is my servant. His carelessness has cost me three sheep this week. Is that so, young man? - They ran away. - They ran away. I heard that before. No! You're supposed to watch them. I found him sleeping. He never pays me. That... He... He's a liar. Pay him now. Or I will run you through with my blade. - What are your wages? - Seven reales a month. No! No, that's not... no! Pay him now villain. Sancho! Untie the boy. Okay, this is... this is... this is just about right. However there is one problem. I don't have money to pay him right now. If you lower your weapon, look I promise I promise to pay him his dues. Know that I am Don Quixote of La Mancha. Righter of wrongs. If I discover you have not fulfill your promise, I will hunt you down and punish you. Even if you try to conceal yourself... like a lizard. Thank you, Señor. Thank you. Have a wonderful day. You sure put the fear of God into that scoundrel, Don Quixote. All villains will quake before us, Sancho. Innocents will be saved. Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the very thing we seek? The golden helmet of Mambrino. There is something on his head. That helmet was intended for only the most worthy knight. This man is surely an imposter. Yield that helmet, thieving rogue! What? - So... old barber's basin. Junk it! - No no no. Sancho! Let me see that. No sorcery could prevent me from recognizing this for what it truly is. The golden helmet of Mambrino. It is not the most complimentary of hats and uh... it is brass. That's because you do not look close enough. You must learn to you look closer, Sancho. Sarah. Answer me! How much longer am I going to have to be in this stuffy box? Madam! We will get there when we get there. I am trapped! Behold, Sancho. A lady in need. How much more, sire? - Madam! - I have had it. Unnatural devils! Release this kidnapped lady at once! Stand aside! I said... stand... aside! Can you hear me out there? Friar! Charge! Brace yourself, my lady. What's going on out there? Is that a barber's basin? Nay nay. This is the golden helmet of Mambrino. Prepare to die. Come back here you weasel! What the devil is going on here? Contessa! Say the word and I will teach these ruffians the true consequences of abusing a lady. Even if it costs me my life. Rise, sir. I was not in any danger. My servants and the friar were conducting me to the sacred shrine at El Rocio. Do I understand that it is your wish that I pardon these men, my lady? Well... It is. Then it is my duty to obey. And they say chivalry is dead. Farewell, my lady. Sancho! - Hey! That's my purse. - Friar! Greed does not become you. We shall sleep here for the night. We can stay at an inn. We have money. We shall sleep beneath the canopy of stars as befit tonight's errant. But I'm not a knight. - Ahh there. That should be fine. - I'm hungry. Are you hungry? What I would do for one of my Teresa's pies? You must learn, Sancho, not to concern yourself with common bodily needs. Ours is a higher calling. We do not need food, sleep or drink like other men. Well, it's the stomach that carry the feet, they say. And... sleep is a cure for misery. Say what you will, good squire. But I can tell, yours is the heart of an adventurer. To breathe the open air, to laugh in the face of death. - That is what you desire. - But those seeking adventure, not always find happiness, Señor. A knight errant does not concern himself with happiness. Only the honor of accomplishment. To suckle the weak, to punish the guilty. These are the goals I seek. I take pride in my wounds and I feel no pain, when I think of the lady whose name they were earned. A knight errant, without a lady love is a tree without leaves or fruits. A body without a soul. How about we go right, master? A knight errant does not veer from his course... no matter the danger. I know that, but in this case... Sancho! Do I see men enslaved against their will? Probably for a good reason. But we cannot ignore their plight. I really think it would be best if we go right now. Think with your heart, Sancho. Not your spleen. Rocinante! By what right do you enslave these souls? By orders of the king. They're convicted criminals on their way to the galleys. By order of the king. Let's go. We are innocent, my lord. It was self-defense, every time. I'm but a poor victim in these harsh times, when examples are made of the unfortunate. Hold your tongue, Pasamonte. Desist! I want to hear him out. We are generous souls. José, never took a real he didn't pass on to the innkeeper. And Enrique, these ladies give pleasure to every man within a hundred miles. You seem like an educated fella. Educated indeed. But persecuted for my good wit. Release these men and I will let you go in peace. Enough! Be gone, fool. You impede the king's order. Please, Señor! They'll report us to the holy brotherhood. By this lance and the might of this arm, I compel you: To comply! Rocinante! Stand still! That wasn't my idea... Take them! Enrique! Give me that ass. Please don't take my ass. - Give me your money! - I cannot! - My wife will kill me! - I'll kill you myself! Alright! Okay! Squeal piggie! Squeal! So long, Amigo! They took my ass. They stole my silver. And they drank my wine. You don't drink a man's wine. And now the Brotherhood is after us. Señor, I warned you. Do not fret, Sancho. A knight errant is above the law. We defied the King's order, Señor. If they find us they'll kill us. You must lower your voice. You do not want to wake him. Who? The giant. There's no giant! Let me down! Let go of my lance! I will hold on forever! Wait till you feel the taste of my lance! You do not frighten me! I am not afraid of you, Freston! Señor! Señor! It's a windmill. A windmill? A moment ago it was a giant. This must be the work of El Sabio Freston. The what? The sorcerer. He transformed it. He must be nearby. Fear not, Sancho. The evil arts of Freston will avail him little against the power of my lance. But you don't have a lance. Señor, please! Come down. I know, Sancho. What is a knight without a lance? What's a squire without his donkey? Oh my God! Why are you always falling? Señor! Are you hurt? Not really Sancho. But... let us camp here for the night. No blanket, no pillow, no food, no wine, no coin. My ass hurts like hell. The Brotherhood's after us. - And I'm not even being paid. - Oh be thankful, Sancho. You finally unburden yourself of the petty trappings of your former soulless existence. I liked my soulless existence. Your journey into a glorious new life is just beginning. That's what I'm afraid of. It's not that person pay you enough to eat. It isn't what a hill of beans. I am thine forever. If I should die, no, perish, I bequeath you my undying love. Are you talking to me, Señor? - Yes, Sancho. Of course. You must memorize these words, insufficient though they may be to capture the depth of my admiration. Your beauty shimmers like the sun. "Your beauty shimmers like the sun. " No. Wait! Shimmers like sunlight on a lake. "Like sunlight on a lake". No, Sancho. Wait. - You want to figure it out? - Yes, listen, Sancho. Please. Concentrate. Your beauty shimmers... like sunlight on the glistening ripples on the placid waters of a lake. You expect me to remember all of this? Of course. Yes, Sancho. You must recite this to Dulcinea. We must warn her of Freston. As you approach her, get down on one knee. Extend your hand... and kiss it softly. Okay. I get it. I get it fully. Thank you. Where can I find this lady? She lives in Castle Toboso. Oh oh yes, Toboso. - Where they serve food and drink? - Yeah? And wenches. Oh I like that place. Yes. Oh, I'll go. Yeah. Commend this to her as proof of my boundless love. We must make haste, good squire. The sorcerer and his dragon are near. It will be difficult to make haste. It is a very long way and I am without my mount. Also my hind quarters is very sore from whipping and just general running. Take my steed, good squire. - What?... - I... I must remain vigilant in fashioning my new lance. Worry not, Señor. Sancho Panza is at your service. What were those words again? That's his horse. Oh Antonia, Antonia. A woman of your worth shouldn't go in there. Mmm. I'm sure you would like it. Who is with the horse outside? Oh, there. That's the man who brought your uncle home. You have my uncle's horse. Where is he? - He's outside. - Not the horse. My uncle. What have you done with him? Nothing, Señorita. He sent me here with his horse to deliver a message. To someone called... Dulcinea. That's it. That's right. I'm here to deliver a message to Dulcinea. - I have no idea who it is. - Oh, for heaven's sake. Where is he? - Who? - We've been searching everywhere. - What's going on over there? - We were just leaving. Come on. - No! - Now! Or I'll inform the Holy Brotherhood you stole our horse. Fine. I will go. But under protest. Okay. I'm taking my wine. Hold it! Who's going to pay for this? Five reales. You left him out there alone... with no horse? I did as he told me. - Is he alright? - His body is fine... but his mind... His mind is another matter. Lead us to him right now. Once I talk to him, he'll see reason. Reason? That... I do not think so. You have to be much more cleverer than that, Señorita. I can lead you to him. Then I'm through. Excuse me. That message is for me. What? You? You're Lady Dulcinea? That is what he called me. Are you sure? Do you know Señor Quixano? It's that his name? The Knight? Please. What is his message? His message is: You are like ripples. What? Like you know... Like the ripples on a lake. He said your face is like a lake. You're lake face. Sorcerers! Sorcerers will be there. Wow, I almost forgot that part. And... dragons. Oh boy. Oh! And... he gave me this. As proof of his undying love. Is that my uncle's blood? - Yes, but it was only a scratch. - We have to leave at once. Undying love. He really said that? Yes. But he also said a lot of crazy things. - Like what? - Like waking up in the middle of the night and say: Her lady! I will suffer any pain. I will face any peril. Do you really want him back home? And there's one person who can help you. Don Quixote! Sancho. Hello, my friend. Did you deliver my message to Dulcinea? Yes I did. Is she not of unparalleled beauty? What? Unparalleled beauty. Sancho! Oh yes, I think one would say that. - Yes. - It's possible to say that about her. - But it ain't. She's here. Look! - Where? I cannot do this. I'm not comfortable telling lies. They're not lying. More like an idea. It's for his safety. But I'm not a princess. She thinks you are. I'm blinded by your beauty, dearest lady. In all this world there's not maiden that's radiant as Princess Dulcinea of Toboso. Forgive me. Brave Knight. Thank goodness, we have found you. Are you in some distress? Pray, tell me. I live to serve you. Umm... My kingdom has been invaded. By whom? Well ah... By a sorcerer. She said he rode in on a dragon. Freston! The very man I seek. You knew him then? Do you think you can help? If there is any knight alive who can vanquish this fiend, it is Don Quixote of La Mancha. What great fortune for my suffering kingdom, sire. But... do you have experience for dragons? There is nothing I do not know about dragons. I am a dragon master. I must leave at once. Oh! Stop it. Señor! We must stay together and protect the princess. There is nothing I value more in this world than the safety of my Dulcinea. Which is why you must guard her with your life, while I venture alone to Toboso. Hand me my lance! Señor, I beg you, stay with us. I cannot. This is a matter that requires the utmost of urgency. The plan was to get him back with us. Well, the first part of the plan worked great, I thought. Come on, we have to keep up. He's so chivalrous, isn't he? Sure. Yeah. Dio mio, it's the Holy Brotherhood. We have no need to be afraid. He will the second they recognize his armor. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha. I demand you to identify yourselves. We are members of the Holy Brotherhood. Peacekeepers in the employ of His Majesty King Philip. I do not recognize such authority. Rocinante! Get out of the way, old man! Get away from the wagon! This man is imprisoned against his will. I command you to release him! That must be the fool who attacked the slave chain. I command you to dismount! Please Señor, he means no harm. Stand back, lady! Free this man at once! I have no time to spare. No! No! He's not in his right mind. He freed the king's slaves. Unhand me! Who are you people? No. No! Where are you taking him? Dulcinea! Dulcinea! My lady! My lady! My lady! Imprisoned. Do you know who I am? I don't much care. All I know is you're a madman. This is one of Freston's evil spells. You are his minions. Hey, old man. Give it a rest, huh. I have failed. The forces of darkness control the world. Why didn't you do something? What could I have done? Where... where are you going? To get the priest. Take the girl back to the inn. Papa! Papa's back! Papa's home. How are you, my little chikos? Papa's very tired. Hold me up. Did you bring us some present? Of course I brought you presents. Close your eyes. Everybody. Close! Close! Okay, open them. - Oh what is it? - Is it a rock? No, it's not just a rock. Then what is it? It's a dragon egg. If you listen very closely, you can hear the faint sound of a dragon's wings beating. No? Then you would have to listen closer. Yes! Go show your mother. Mama! Mama! Mama! I'll get you all dragon eggs. Teresa, my sweet. I'm home. So, this is how a governor dresses? - And where is my donkey? - Oh. I can explain. Our livelihood depends on with that animal. Please don't get mad. The strangest thing happened. Dapple has more sense than you. He brought himself home. In fact, while you off getting rich, we had been doing just fine without you. Teresa, my sweet. I just want to be home with you, and the children. And poor. No more adventures? No more adventures. I have some chores for you before supper. - Perfect. - Mm hm. And I have some chores for you after supper. Come on! Oh, I miss you, my stallion. - Oh yes! - Oh! I guess this is it. Oh! Oooh! Sancho! You are braver than you know, Sancho. Yes... Yes my... Fight for your knight's honour. What is the matter? I left him to face the Holy Brotherhood alone. Si, you had the brains to flee! Oh, Sancho. Who goes there? - State your purpose. - Just a weary traveler... who is trying to find his way home before dawn. Might I be able to sit by your fire? We're members of the Holy Brotherhood. You need to leave. The Holy Brotherhood. How foolish of me. I couldn't tell in the darkness. It's an honor to meet you, fine gentlemen. Us common folk are in your debt. The righters of wrong, the protectors of the innocent. Would you care for some wine? Surely you can have some wine for all your noble services? No. Leave now! Of course. There must be some edict forbidding members of the Brotherhood from drinking wine. Forgive me. - I do not recall such an edict. - Nor I. Remember our Lord shared his wine with his friends at the Last Supper? Who are we to not honor the customs of our Lord and Saviour? Come on, Thomas, relax. I could use a little. It's been a long day. Very well, Thomas. Here you go. - And here's one. - It's good wine. - Enjoy, gentlemen. - It's very good. Hey, guys. You got any extra wine for me? ** Are you feeling alright? Excuse me? - Are you feeling alright? - It's a cold night. But I'm sure I'll feel better with the fire. Fat boy! On the belt. There! Give me the keys. You! I know you. No, I don't think so. I've never seen you, man. Yeah! - You whipped me. - No. You took my ass and then you took my silver. I never took nobody's ass in my whole life. - I saw you with my eyes. - I have one of those faces. I don't trust you. Get away from the gate. I'm going crazy in this cage. And if you don't open that lock, I might scream. I might scream! Don't scream. Don't scream. Just be quiet, okay. Now this is how you unlock. - That's right. Be quiet. - Sssh. Okay. - Speak quietly. - Yah. Yah. See you, piggy! Don Quixote. Señor... Señor, it's me Sancho. Your noble squire. We have leave. The brotherhood is here. Adios Idiotas! Vesate Culo! Hey! It's Pasamonte. Go get the mule. - No! Forget about him. - Señor. Get him! Stole my horse! Señor, are you okay? Let's go! Come on! Let's go! We must leave before they return. Señor. Señor. Please, please, senor. No no. Don't die. No, no. Don't die. Not like this. Not now, senor. Oh Sancho, you are the most worthless creature alive. But you, Don Quixote of La Mancha, you're the bravest man I've ever met. You risk everything to help those in need. I didn't always appreciate you. But you always saw the best in me, Señor. You'll always be... the great Don Quixote of La Mancha. Señor! Señor! You're alive! Señor, you're alive. I thought you were dead. No... That was quite an eloquent eulogy. You were a little hard on yourself. You... are the bravest squire I have ever known. Look! Uncle! Thank goodness! Rocinante! Good day Señorita. I am in your debt, good sir, for returning my noble steed. I must ask you to dismount at once. You're only too glad to be rid of this nag. I assure you, my friend. Rocinante. Noble Rocinante. This is indeed a joyous reunion. Uncle, you can't go on. I have no time for idle talk. We are on an urgent quest - to track down the sorcerer. - There is no sorcerer. The princess and the dragon, we... we made all that up. - Father, stop him! - Don Quixote! Enough of this madness. Come home now. I'll bring you new books, huh? We could read the Bible together. There are some wonderful stories in there. I'll leave the Bible to you, Father. Some men are men of letters. I am a man of arms. I admire your faith. In truth, I'm a little jealous. But these fantasies you believe in, they just aren't real. And what you believe in, is? Come, Sancho! Go on then! I hope you find the giant who... cracks your crazy head open like a nut! - Father! - What? I'm sorry. Señorita, don't worry. I will look after him. You said you were through, Sancho? Are you now as mad as he is? Yes. Yes, I am. Remember... fortune favors the brave. Come on boy. Come on. That's that, then huh? Antonia... Antonia! Antonia, where are you going? We must be ever wary. Freston is a shape shifter and can appear in any form. I fear for you, loyal squire. Fear not, great knight. I believe I finally found my calling. What is your name, sir? I am the Knight of the White Moon. I seek Don Quixote of La Mancha. What do you wish of him? I wish to challenge him in combat, in order to prove that the Knight of the White Moon, not he, is the greatest knight to ever don Armour. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha and I accept your challenge. No living man will ever best me. No no no. No, no, no, Señor. It's too dangerous. Have faith, Sancho. He has met his match. But I promised Señorita that I would look after you. Stand aside squire. This quarrel does not concern you. But what if... what if he is the sorcerer in disguise? Aha! Then he will meet his just dessert. I have one condition. Ah see, Sancho. He makes conditions. He knows he's over matched. Whoever is bested on this day, must retire from knighthood forever. Forever? I do not agree to that. Okay, fine. For one full year from this minute. No less. Señor, it's not too late to postpone. Act in haste, regret at leisure. I've heard it said. I'm growing weary of delay. I accept your challenge! A sacred oath. One year! Agreed. Whatever happens, Sancho Panza, know that you have served me well. Thank you, Sir. Don Quixote! - Oh! - Oh! No no no no! Don Quixote... Are you all right? Come on, senor. You can still defeat him. Do you yield, sir? Never! Draw your sword! - My... my sword. - Sword? Okay. Don't hurt him! He's a confused old man. Miguel? Antonia. - Antonia. Señor, are you all right? - What were you thinking? You could have killed him. No no no. I didn't touch him. I mean what's going on? Your uncle and I made a pact. Don Quixote, you swore a solemn oath to set aside your Armour for a full year. You have bested me sir. Whether by foul means or fair, the history books will decide. But Don Quixote... is a man of his word. I remember my grandfather had an old suit of Armour and a horse, and I just... you know. That was smart of you... and brave. The Knight of the White Moon? I don't know... Alright... That was... Yeah. Until such time as I resume my calling, A year of pastoral life could be bearable, I believe, Sancho? I have heard this prophet in raising sheep. It's a fine notion. We could tend our flock by day and sleep out under the stars at night. Or we can drink wine in a fine shepherd's hut. Oooh, we have a life. We'll live, my friend. - Antonia? - Yes. Uncle? I've had the strangest dreams. I dreamt I was travelling the countryside as a knight-errant. With a portly squire. Much like the little man with all the children. What's his name? Sancho; Right. Sancho Panza. And as absurd as it sounds, I feel the sting of a ** in the saddle, and the bruises of battle on my body. Isn't that strange? We have a lot to talk about. Oh, yes, yes, yes! - Oh! - Oh yeah! Oh Sancho! Sancho Panza! No. Wha... what? Sancho! It's Señor Quixano. You promised! No more adventures! Fine. Sancho. Si, Don Quixote. Not anymore. Always. You will always be the great knight-errant of La Mancha. Tales of our adventures echo through the village, Señor. Your legend will live forever. I wish we could ride out together one more time, Sancho. That's him. Did you hear how he escaped from the Holy Brotherhood? I heard that he fought a giant. I heard he slew a fire-breathing dragon with his bare hands. Dulcinea! I lied to you, Señor. I'm only the innkeeper's daughter, not a princess. And my name is not Dulcinea. It is a beautiful name. And it suits you so well. No man has ever seen me... the way you do, Don Quixote. I see you as you are. Farewell my lady. I will always ride in your honor. So the noble Don Quixote of La Mancha set out on one final adventure. His legend lives on.
