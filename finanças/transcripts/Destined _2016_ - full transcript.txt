Hey, come on, baby. Smile. Smile. Aww. Finish eatin'. Look, they've been givin' these out all week. Somethin' about renovation. Who? Some company. Calvin still over at the mayor's office? Why don't you ask him? You're my little boy. Always first in my heart. Hey, baby. What's goin' on? How ya doin'? Took a stack for you, two for the center. Get 'em coats, boots, and all that shit. It's cold outside. Okay. You makin' friends or what? Nah. They're way too bougie for me over here. Is that right? It's cold out here, go in the house. Gotta run. What you up to now? Hm? Go in the house, Ma. I'll call you later. You don't get into any trouble now, ya hear me? Naw, never that. I love you. This is where all of our associates sit. Our interns are over here. Our main consultants sit in the back corner. Requests for proposals, you know pretty much everything that you could need in terms, yeah? This kid right here, is he new? - Oh, Rasheed? - Yeah. Rasheed is, uh, he's been with us for a little while now. Into the meeting? - Yes, please. - Sure. Hey. Hey. Now, I believe most of you know me and the founder of Holder Group certainly needs no introduction. What I wanna talk to you about today is the... Howard Roark. Everybody knows who that is, right? Of course ya do, you're architects. What we're looking for is our very own Howard Roark. We have a very unique project on our hands with the Brewster Homes redevelopment. What we need is the best of this new breed of architect that your boss here claims to have. Hey everybody. Hey, thank you so much for bein' here. Nice to see you. Nice to see you, Jim. The only way we will return to the greatness that we once had, is workin' together. Yes. We can change this city. We're already there. We just need to go one step further. Mayor lookin' like a goddamn hustler. Jim, you're the big bear, I'm the little bear. You gotta help the little bear. You gonna have to help the little bear, Scott. Okay, 'cause I'm countin' on y'all. Okay, thank you so much. Thank you. Beautiful, Mayor. Excuse me, guys. Who's your boy? Some clown. Election's comin' up. You know how that is. They gon' come, they gon' go. This guy a friend of yours? Oh yeah, best friend. Let me know when you finish adding up all the money we made today. The mayor and I would really appreciate that. You got it. All right, buddy. All right, now. All right. What was that, Calvin? Some shit. Hey, how's it goin'? Thank you guys for havin' me. I just wanna say that, um, I have the vision and hunger central to the Holder ethos. Right here is my latest rendering. A design that exceeds platinum lead certification. I'm sorry, but why would a building ever need to exceed platinum? Silver is more than sufficient for, what, 99% of most contractors' needs? Well, with platinum you can be... Seems a bit excessive, no? No, that's good, son. What else do you have? I'm workin' on a mall right now. I thought Anderson had the MacMillan contract. It's on 12th Street. You mean a strip mall? Yes, a strip mall. Thank you for your time, Rasheed. Appreciate it. I'm sorry, can I take a look at that one? In the book? What is this? Go ahead. It's a design at the community center down at the Brewster Projects. I used to walk through there when I was a kid. I used to imagine what it would be like one day just to make things better there. Fix it up, ya know? Thanks. What were you doin' down in that neighborhood as a kid? Just curious. I'm from there. The Brewster Projects. Mack and Bewick, 2nd and MLK, 6 Mile and Woodward, that strip club right there? Then there's Grand River and Beck. Good, good. Hey man, you wastin' your time. My numbers are good. Cal, what's this? What? Right here. Right here. Right here, look. What's this? Come on, Sheed. A couple months? How long we known Old Duke? He's makin' us look bad. Not now, bro. It's Mr. Davis. Yo, Sheed. Hey, what's up? Yo, y'all doin' that again at Christmas? Buy Christmas gifts for your kids while y'all out here pissin' cash on this dice, right man? Aww, come on, man. You seen Mr. Davis? You seen Mr. Davis, bro? Shit. Hey, girl. Hey, hey, come here when I'm talkin' to you. Hey, yeah, yo. Who the hell? Relax, dude. Hey, Maya. Maya. What you doin' here, hm? I'm goin' home. Home? Maya! What's this? I'm in school now. I'm lookin' for your Daddy. Of course you are. You stayin' with him? He stays with me. When he stays. And then I want you to start with the first question. What are your favorite foods to eat and why? For the teacher you know you can put my name there, Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis, look at me. Come here, boy. Come here. How you doin'? Hey, man. I thought you forgot about us. No, of course not. What you got goin' on here? Yeah, I just came back from takin' the kids to the Arab World Festival. And they were bored for a minute there, then the belly dancers came out and started shakin' and then the boys just lit up. Look at you. Though they hadn't got my attention. Shut up, boy, what's up? Hey. Hey! Since when's customer service part of your stees? You seein' if they're satisfied? You two know each other, right? Y'all know each other? Rasheed. Thomas. I think I've seen him around. Don't be stupid now. Tell me that this is your boss. I've never seen him. You ever been locked up? Juvie. It ain't shit. Juvie. On this wrap you start off in juvie. You transfer to state at 18. Girls, school, sports, prom, fun. You won't have any of it. I never seen him. I guess he wants to go for a ride. You're one hell of a role model. It's only a matter of time. Somebody's gonna break. That badge can break, too. You done? It's a beautiful place, man. It's kinda hard to keep it together, but I'm glad we're doin' it. I miss you, man. I miss you, too. I'm glad you came back. Maya. Hey. - Hey. - What's up? How are you? - I'm good. - Good. I love this music. For real? Oh, my God, yeah. Classical Spanish guitars, it's the best. Yeah. Calvin. What's up, boy. - What's up, man? - What's up, boy? - Hey, baby. - Hey. Lookin' good. Dance with me. Not right now, baby. Not to this. All right? Okay. Well, it looks like things done changed. You still in there, Calvin. At least you didn't get killed on your interview like I did. Was it that bad? Worse. He ain't talk, did he? He's 14. So? Got his ass whooped, doin' a little bit. That's part of the game. That boy earnin' his stripes. And that New Jack City crackhead center, what part of the game is that, Cal? Those are our best customers. My mama doin' charity work at that place, man. Hey, man. I thought we agreed you was gonna lay low until Holder was off your ass. All right, let me handle this day to day shit. Then handle it, Cal. I got this. You need to tell me what's goin' on. I saw Maya. What's up with her? Here. I feel like I'm in a movie. Will Smith, huh? I Am Legend. Ah, look. Breeze is gone and the heat is pointing towards you. Means the streets are talking. And we are the fuckin' streets. Take it easy, firecracker. Hold up, Cal, hold on. Too much, gun powder, man. You might explode. Pow! Cal, let him breathe, man. Let's see what he gotta say. Not a good time to make a new deal. You see crack is black. Bills, methamphetamines, it's a whole new game. International. So stick to what you know. Hey, everybody. Today, it's a historic day because this represents a new time, a new destiny in this city. We're all tied together in a single garment of mutual destiny, which means that my future's inextricably linked with his and yours and yours and yours. And together we're making a new Detroit. When I talk about the new Detroit, this is what I think about. I think about projects and developments like this. And I think about this young man here. Thank you, thank you. Yes, yes, this project is very special to the company. But no more special to anyone in this room than the person that we are naming as lead architect. The vision behind the new Brewster Homes, a man from the place himself, Mr. Rasheed Smith. Come on up here, Rasheed, come on. Congratulations. Congratulations. Let's get a picture together. Step back. No, no, no, step back. Giselle Porter from the Detroit Press. Hey, I'm Rasheed. I know, hi. So, land this job, represent your old neighborhood, how does it feel? It feels good. And are you aware of... That's right. As it should. Hey, Giselle. I'm surprised they let you in. So, how'd it go? You wrote the mayor was singing for tips? It turns out I was right. I mean you've certainly been makin' it rain for a while. That's gonna have to be all, Giselle. Come on, Rasheed. We've got a lot of important people to talk to tonight. Arturo, do you see these buildings right here? Yeah, that one. This whole fuckin' block, man, look around. One year, new condos. Lost all of 'em. Okay, so what has that got to do with me, huh? You said stick to what I know, right? So I'm tellin' you what I know. Cal, you good with numbers, right? Mm-hm. How many of these spots is filled here downtown? 98%. And 90% of 'em? Young and white. And what's young and white 90% mean? A new heron user. - Yeah. - Meth? 80%. Molly, X, I don't know, 75, 85. Okay, cha cha cha. Sounds like a fiesta. So, what are we doing? Well, the demand is here and the supply's going. And whether we get the supply from you or from somewhere else means you better make a decision. I like your style, Sheed. 21 days we meet again. Y'all got a mariachi band playin' in that bitch or somethin'? Sheed. Estero's Mariachi is one of the classics. Spanish guitar, listen to it. Maybe someday I'll teach you something, Sheed. Until then,. Yeah, one day. Vamanos. I swear to God, I'm gonna kill this nigga one of these days. Not now, man. It's our fuckin' time. Shit. Night clubs now, after hours, which means we gotta be more careful. Not just the undercovers, customers, everybody. Molly, X, that should make 'em happy. Party all night. Heron? Put 'em to sleep. This shit right here, make 'em lose they goddamn mind. I'm talkin' crazy, stupid, insane shit. This is coke times 20. Be up for a week, mind gone. End up playin' catch with they kids because the baby ass remind 'em of a goddamn football. But we know our dope... This is what I was thinkin'. Right there, see? Pretty damn good, actually. You did this in a week? It's impressive. Great, Rasheed. Although I wish you coulda held off until we had this meeting. Ethan and Kyle here, they're gonna help you along as you conceptualize. You've got vision, son. We want to nurture it, right? Right. Wanna give you all the resources that you need. Well, you alive. What's up, Calvin? What's goin' on? They brought in this company to help conceptualize. Feels like my ideas are gettin' lost, man. What company? Creative Concepts. Shit. That's what this is. What is? The mayor's office just got a big donation from this Creative Concepts. And? When a donation like that comes in you do some research. I did the research. The last big project they worked on? Was the Rockwell Homes, man. Look, the Creative Concepts money and the Holder contributions, there's a huge difference between a donation and a straight payoff, my brother. These are the neighborhood killers. This them. Rasheed, I know you been bustin' your ass and this supposed to be your joint, then take it... And now I know, Calvin. You plan on, you tryin' to tell me you gonna go through with this? Are you kidding me? Have you not seen the Rockwell Homes? Look, we're not sure the Rockwell Homes is even... No, no, if Holder and Creative Concepts are workin' together, we are sure what this is. What's left to figure out? Listen to you, Calvin. I've been in the system since I was a boy. I went down for that shit. I covered for yo ass, man. Even after I got out I worked all these years to get all the way here, man. And now you think I can't deal with this shit? This is a different game, brother. This is big business. It's a major corporation and you on the wrong side. I can make this work. It's my design and my face is fuckin' on it. Yes and a fuckin' face is all you are to these people. Mm, you. Who told you I was here? You did. That's right. Fuck. Thanks. Go ahead. Nah. Come on, what do you got? Woo! Yeah! All right. Cecil Fielder. All right, Cecil Fielder. Get a hit of that, Cecil. I always loved that game. I coulda been damn good, too. It was football for me. Coulda been a beast, man. You know, you shouldn't have seen me like that. Oh, it's fine. Although, it was kinda funny when you fell on your ass. So, I was thinkin', if I'm gonna do this there's a few things I need. I need full disclosure, more control of what's... Pause right there. Since we're on full disclosure. I got a question for you. Why didn't you play? Football, you were gonna be a beast, right? Why weren't you? I just didn't have the chance, man. Rasheed, why didn't you play? Was there no football team in juvie? Conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer? It'd be a shame if a dirty little secret like that made its way into the world. My record was expunged at 21, Dylan. I mean, forget this job, man. I'm talkin' about your whole career. The Holder name goes a long way. Listen, what we're doin' here is good for everyone. The city, your mom, you. My record was expunged, man. Don't go there, bro. Don't worry about it, bro. Your secret's safe with me. Do you wanna take me home, hm? Baby, come on. Come dance with me. Let's get this dress off. Hm? Come on, come dance with me. ♪ Be like the models in the magazines Or take me home. Hold this, I'll be back. ♪ Everybody got a different story ♪ On the other side I know the one who's waitin' for me ♪ On the other side I know, I know ♪ I gotta get it You're here. Yeah. My friends, "All you do is school and that boy." Boy? I, um... Oh, you got a little boo thing in there, huh? What? Yeah, yeah, I got a boo thing, but I see you got a boo thing in there, too, so. Oh, she... I see you watchin' me. I wasn't watchin' you. You just left. Look, I never heard from you, Maya. You didn't call or nothin'. We... We were kids. And you were in the game. You still are. You coulda been anything. You coulda been an artist. So you remember? , right? Uh, I don't know, maybe. I could still be an artist. You know I can... Hold on. Sheed, it's fine. Oh.

You can't be here right now. Nobody tell me what I can't do, Maya, you know that. Okay, Sheed, can you just come inside? Why, what's goin' on? Can you come inside, please? - Whoa, hold up, hold up now. - Can you get inside? Jesus. Hey, sweetie. - Hey, Ma. - Hey. Hey, how was school? - Good. - Good. Hey, um, I was thinkin' that maybe you and Jamal could go see a movie? For real? - Yeah. - Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. I don't think we have money for the movies. Jahari, just take it. - No, but we... - Jahari. Call me. Be safe. You think he's workin' through the mom? The kid? Let's follow the kid. Can you go, please? Sheed, go. You, out. But I thought... New policy. Too young. Get out. But they told me I could be the... Get the fuck out! And then the amount of germs and bacteria that the patient is susceptible to if we don't take the necessary precautions... Is really... Hi, yes, can we help you? Excuse me, sir, this is a private class. Can I help you? Are you looking for a particular room? Maya? Are you o... Hey! Hey. Are you crazy? You can't just come in here when you want to. Why you didn't tell me? You can't just decide when you wanna step back into my life. Why you didn't tell me, Maya? Huh? Why! Why the fuck you didn't tell me? Because I didn't want him to turn out like you! Every man I've ever loved has either been dead, locked up, or on that shit. Not him. Ya hear me? You hear me? Not him! Maybe I woulda left the game, Maya. Well, we couldn't take that chance. Look at you. Yeah, look at me. I'm a fuckin' lion, that's what I am. Survivin' out here in this fuckin' wild. Look at me!

I see you around here again that's yo ass. Good afternoon everyone. Mayor Jones sends his deepest apologies for his absence today, so he wants you to know that he is supporting you at every turn and he knows he's gonna have your support on voting day. Developing this project has been a great experience so I am proud to announce that we only have one more resident who has to sign their paperwork in order to cut this ribbon. Why don't you come on up here, Mrs. Smith. Mom, don't go through with this. You can't do it. It's him. I was gettin' worried about you, cuz. Sheed. Deal is off, man. What? Cal, listen.

So. Where's your boss? Boss? Hey yo, that bread is my boss. Where the dope? So where is Sheed? I'm not putting my people out. Those people out there, they've already signed the agreements. You're in here worrying about their honor? I promise you all they're worried about is their stipend. So, I'm gonna say it again. Take a moment, a brief moment, and then come on back out and let's finish this. Got it? Dad. Stay outta this, Dylan, please. - Rasheed... - No! Look, I'm a part of this. I'm not gonna let you...
