Something like that. You're Venus or Aphrodite? Aphrodite. The Greeks were so much more romantic than the Romans. Really? Yeah, Aphrodite was first. Venus just a mere imitation once the Romans conquered the world. I stand corrected. So are you living here or are you just visiting? Neither. Where are you going? Nowhere special. My place is not far from here. It's just, you know, a couple stops, so if you need a place to sleep and just... I'm fine. Are you sure? Look, Ryuu, you're cute and what happened in the club was nice but it was a one time thing. Just, you know, I've slept on a train before and I, trust me, futon is much more comfortable. You promise not to try anything? A man is nothing without his word. - Okay but if you... - I promise. Come in. Nice place. Thanks. A little small but it's a home. Hey, nice suits. Thanks. Tailored, like worsted wool. Good quality. You can tell. Salary man? You can take the bed, I'm gonna sleep here. I can sleep on the floor, this is your place. You're my guest. Exactly, which is why you can stay in your own bed. Thanks. You need this? Oh, thanks. Goodnight.

Can you hand me the towel? Sure. Can I watch? Sure, you can watch. Okay, show's over. Are you on the wagon? Wagon? Yeah. Used to use and stopped? Yeah. I stopped. Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Takes a lot of strength to break a habit. Just one day at a time. Yep, that's what I heard. So, what's your story? My story? Yeah. There is something about you. I'm impulsive. Yeah, I can tell. You got a problem with that? No, just curious. Nice ink. Thanks. You too. Thanks. Are you hungry? Yeah. Okay, let's get something to eat. So, how long you been in Japan? Too long. What brought you here? A plane. I meant, why did you come here? I know what you meant. So you don't wanna talk about it. I can't get anything past you, can I? Decent coffee. It's okay. Look, I'm not one of those open books kind of people. I'm not gonna spill my life history just because I got some decent dick. What're you laughing at? Decent dick. You liked it. Yeah. I was just wondering, how you feel about... What, fucking in a club? Have you ever before? Have you? Maybe. Maybe? I knew you wanted it after you were all up on me on the dance floor. I just wanted to dance, okay? All on my ass? It's a nice a ass. Thank you. You want some? Yes, please, thank you. Okay. So, is this like our first date? - First date? - Yeah. I think we're just hanging out. What's the difference? Nothing, I guess. Okay, so, I should ask you about you more. Like what? Like... What's your favorite movie? Hmmmm. "The Notebook." "Notebook?" Okay. Yes, "The Notebook." You got a problem? No. It's not like I said "Citizen Kane" or something. I know, I mean, "The Notebook" is, you know, sweet love story it's not a great cinema but it's enjoyable. Okay, Mr. Film Snob, what's your favorite? "Breathless." "Breathless?" Yeah. It's a complicated love story. A love story? Yeah. What, and "The Notebook" doesn't count? It's a different kind of love story. Thank you. You wanna know a secret? Secret? What? I'm psychic. Psychic? Yes. Okay. See that waitress, there? Yeah. She's gonna be running in the next 30 minutes. Is she? Mm-hmm. Okay. I'll even bet you if I win, you have to sing a song to me. Sing a song? Mm-hmm. And if I win? What do you want? Tell me why you came to Japan. Deal. Deal. So now you have 30 minutes. I wanna ask you a personal question. You wanna ask me a personal question but... Okay, okay, okay. I'll tell you one thing about me. Okay, tell me. I'm from Manchester. I moved to the U.S. when I was like 15. So you're British. No, American. Some habits are harder to break than others. So, what's your question? I noticed your arms, the scars. Yeah? How long you been clean? It's a little over six months. Six months? Yep. What made you quit? I got arrested. Well... Oh. I'm sorry, thank you. Thank you. I told you I was psychic. You're right. You owe me a song. Okay, I owe you a song. You like strawberries? I love them. They have the best strawberries here. Mmmmm. Wait, what is the difference? Which one? - This one. - Okay. Konnichiwa. Have a seat. Nice to meet you. She's asking you where you're from. Ah, I'm from America. Oh, America? I'm gonna wash hers and make some tea, okay? Okay. America. Yeah. She said she used to have American boyfriend. Oh, nice. She said she was with him when she was 16, after the war. Ah. His name was William and he was very gentle and a good looking guy. Nice. He dumped her at the movie theater. Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Mm-hmm. She said, you are kinda cute. Oh. Arigato, thank you. Thank you. Aw. You are too cute. That is adorable. Your grandfather? Yeah. You wanna meet him? Yeah. Come here. Hope, this is my grandfather. She is so sweet. Thanks. How long were your grandparents married? I think it's a little over 50 years. What? That's a long time. Yeah. They were soulmates, weren't they? I don't know about that. You don't? You know how he proposed to her? Your grandfather? Yeah. How? They went to a festival and he was walking her home. And he quietly asked her if she can make morning miso soup every day and she said yes. And that's it? That's it. That was the romance for the time. I'd like to still believe there's a soulmate out there for me. Yeah, that's nice but I'm a realist. I think every relationship we have will fail until we have one that doesn't. There is no other one but the one we choose. And what about love? I believe in love. I just don't believe there's just one person out there specifically for you. So you do believe in love but just not the one. Precisely. You're cynical. It's not cynical, it's honest. Isn't that what women say what they want in a man? Honesty? Yeah, we want romance too. I can be romantic. That is chivalry. That is not romantic. I could ask you to make miso soup every morning. Unfortunately, I don't know how to make miso soup. I could teach you. I'm sure you could. I wanna be like her when I'm her age. She's so free and uninhibited. I don't know if I'll ever be that age. You'll live a long life. As long as you eat healthy and exercise. Not slip up? What makes you say that? You know, it's a everyday struggle. You're going to live a long life. You're fortunate. For a moment while I was in there, it felt like she was my grandmother. Yeah. She has that effect on people. I never knew my grandparents. No? I hardly knew my parents. Grandparents would've been a luxury. I've only seen pictures of my grandmother. She's wearing this in one of them. This is all I have of her. I noticed that before. I wanted to ask about it. My mother gave it to me before she died. Other than that, I don't know much about it. It's an heirloom. It's a beautiful connection to your past. Peaceful. What did you wanna be when you was a boy? When I was a boy? Yeah. I wanted to be a yakitori shop owner. You know those little... - Yeah. - You know? I know what it is. Yeah. When I was a boy, my grandfather used to take me to Yakitori Track owned by a man called Chan. I used to think he was so cool. You know, like, cooking yakitori on the grill and he would always joke around. Usually he gave us an extra one as a service. That's sweet. You know, when I looked into your eyes in that picture of you, you have all of this bright-eyed optimism. Made me curious. What would that boy back then say to you right now? He would probably say, what the fuck did you do to us? Where did you mess up? Everybody makes mistakes. Not like me. It can't be that bad. When I was a girl, I wanted to be an artist. I used to draw pictures of everything. I studied art at high school. I even considered going to art school. Until my boyfriend told me I wasn't that good. Then you quit? I did. Never to draw again? Nope. That's a shame. That's life. You should draw again. I don't know about that. Come on. Nothing to be afraid of unless you try. What do you have to lose? Nothing, I guess. Right? Okay. If you ever want a model... You'll pose for me? I will pose for you. Look. This is my super cool look. And this is my seductive look. And... This is my sexy but disinterested look. How about that? I'm sure you've used those looks before. No, I'm just playing around. But I will pose for you. Be careful, I might take you up on that. I like you, Hope. I like talking with you. I like talking with you too. I want to spend time with you more. What? I know this sounds crazy, we just met, but why don't you stay with me? Look, let's just enjoy today.

I don't need to drink but if that's something that you want I can just... I want to do it for you. Why? Let's just say I need to give. That girl is staring at us. Do you know her? Just ignore her. Ryuu? Let's go. I'm sorry you had to see that. She must've loved you very much. I was a different person. It was never about love or feelings. It's always about get the next high and now, it's like my past. No matter how much I wanna put it behind me, it's always staring me in the face. Our past is only a part of who we are. Maybe where you come from. But here, here is still your past, no matter your present. Forget what other people think. You've got to stop holding on to it, just let it go. I'm trying.

After she died, it was like his was of staying connected to her, I guess. Well, you sure know your way around that kitchen. What's the story? Where you a chef in a former life? No, far from it. So, what then? You're correct. I was a salary man. I used to have, it was a great job for the fashion industry. I used to go to Milan, Paris, London every season. It was my dream job but I had a very heavy habit. I worked long hours and needed to stay on all day, every day. Over time, it became a daily habit. One day, I had a meeting with a major vendor who could have given me a promotion in the company. In the middle of the meeting, my nose bleeds, and this vendor wanted to be polite. Doesn't say a word and when the blood drips down from my noise, drips down to lips and suits and tie. Wow. I was so high and in the zone, I never noticed. Once I finished the presentation, the vendor and his team excused themselves and never came back. What? Just like that, they didn't say anything? It's my fault. The supervisor had me take a drug test. They searched by desk and they found a small stash. I was so stupid. What? They can't search your desk. Do you know the Japanese word for privacy? No, what is it? Privacy. Because there is no word in Japanese for it. It doesn't exist. What is your happiest childhood memory? My mother. ♪ And watching ♪ She loved to dance. She would dance anywhere. Our living room, laundry room, in the supermarket. I remember one day after dinner she turned on the radio and her and my dad just stood up and danced.

I'm not a big fan of cigarettes. You smoke. What're you talking about? I'm more of a social smoker. Yeah? That's what they call it these days. Hey. I wanna ask you a silly question. What? If you could be any superhero, who would you be? Superhero? Yeah. I don't know. Kinnikuman. Who's that? He's a wrestler and he has a superpower. That's my, he was my dream.

I just wanna make things right. It's just a necklace. It's not about the necklace. Stay here. Sorry. He doesn't have the necklace. Hey. You're crazy. Do you know what? It belonged to your grandmother. I know it's important to you. That's sweet but you did not need to. He deserved it. No one steals from my girl... my friend and gets away with it. Anyway, what's the story with your neighbor? Is he like the resident lady killer? He just moved in a few months ago and there always a different girl every other night. He must be like a real lady's man. These walls are thin. You can hear everything. Ah. Ah, Ryuu! Ah, God! Yes! Yes, Ryuu! Oh my God, yes! - Yes, baby, ah! - Yes, ah! - Ah, ah, ah! - Oh, come on! - Oh. - You are so funny. Anyway. Desert? Mmmmm. Our night of dessert misadventure. Yeah, it was. It sill tastes good. Hmmm. Mmmmm. Sweet. Yep. What can I do to convince you to stay with me? Seattle. That's where you're from? Yeah. I can imagine you from New York or Chicago. No, just a girl from Seattle. So why Japan? I met Kouichi in Seattle. He was an exchange student. Met him on campus, I took him on a tour. We started hanging out and dating and then we stayed in contact and he asked me if I could come and be with him in Japan. He said I could get a job teaching English, so I applied for a few places and I got hired. He had gotten his own place by then so I stayed with him. Then I realized he was obsessed and insanely jealous. He told me that he would never let me go. I knew I needed to get out of there. Then I realized he had taken my passport. One afternoon, when I was cleaning the apartment, I found where he had been hiding my passport. I purchased my ticket during my lunch break. It was three days ago. I got on a train to Tokyo. I figured I could hide out here until it was time for me to leave. So tomorrow I got back home to Seattle. To pick up the pieces. I'm so sorry. I'm so glad I met you. This is the first time I felt in control of my life since I got here. And as much as I would love to... Kishi kaisei. Kishi kaisei? Yeah. Wake from death and return to life. Like a phoenix? Kind of.
