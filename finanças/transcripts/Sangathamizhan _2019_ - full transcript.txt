Hello, sir Please come here Speak in Hindi Anyone knows Tamil? - What, madam? - What is happening here? We are preparing this ground for a copper factory to be built here Copper factory? People in our town own this land How can a factory be built here? 'What are you saying?' 'From our forefathers' time this has been agricultural land' 'You tricked us by making us part with our documen-' - Yes, sir - What happened? People of this town are objecting to a factory being constructed here - Has the property been registered? - Yes, sir Then toss the legal document on to their faces! 'This is our Marimuthu bro's land' Kumaresan anna's land - Show - Look here - Kumaresan bro's land? - This is Sekar anna's land - How did they get ownership? - Don't know Thamizh is here Let's discuss it with him I'll get back to you Hey, come - What's the problem? - Factory is coming up here Good if a factory comes up Why protest for that? Not an ordinary factory It is a copper factory which will affect people's health What are the repercussions? 'Show me' 'Toxins from copper when melted will disperse in the air' 'When people inhale, it will irritate their respiratory tubes' 'And affect their lungs and lead to miscarriages in pregnant women' 'It can affect even the next generation' 'A similar factory was built in Maharashtra' 'People protested with great difficulty and closed it' - How did this happen? - Means? Can't happen without your knowledge You would've only given the documents A real estate group brought this land in bulk intending to plan a layout But I was not aware of this factory plan Your uncle Kuzhandhaivel is completely in the loop How did they get hold of our people's lands? All because of corporate rascals, bro Everyone has bought 10 acres each from registrar's office to mill owners I think they sold each land separately and handed it over to a corporate firm This won't be accepted anywhere else in our country - What can we do now? - We can't touch them Bottom line, we can't even go anywhere near their area I was also wondering what to do You gave me the perfect idea! Amit - Have they left? - They got scared and ran away Sir, shall I- Get into the car HEY...! All get in Leave now Right away Take your vehicle and leave 'Listen, dear' Your father wants to talk to you - Tell me, pa - 'What's the point in beating him?' - This factory is bad news - 'I know' - 'You're hitting the wrong man, come home' - No, but- 'Just listen to me' Who the hell invented this wretched phone! 'It's wrong' 'I can handle it' Hello, Devaraj Is it something important you want to discuss? I believe a proposed factory here will be hazardous for the entire town Someone has fed you wrong information If this factory- Hey! Get up Get up, I say Treating an elderly gentleman with scant respect seated like this You are speaking out of turn - Do you know who I am? - I care two hoots, da First you find out about me, my father and our entire town Thamizh, let me handle this, okay? Sanjay sir, please wait Gopi, escort sir to the other room - Please come, sir - Wait for a little while Devaraj, you're speaking without knowing the actual facts Most of our people will benefit jobwise because of this factory Our town will also prosper Can you explain how? Air we breathe is more important than the money lining our pockets Who needs a factory which pollutes our atmosphere? Kuzhandhai, we work hard and earn only for the benefit of our next generation By affecting our health and our future generations ...why do we need that damn factory? Devaraj, when a new factory is built... ...people are bound to object You're getting emotional listening to all that Then how will our nation become a superpower? We are mainly an agricultural nation If you leave our farmers in peace we will become a superpower It is no longer in our hands Kuzhandhai, you are the MLA of our town If we face any issue, you are supposed to stop it and it is your duty But if you instigate the issue! I can't do it Then that proposed factory will remain a pipedream! Do what you can Come, my son What gross injustice! How can any man stoop so low, Thamizh? Who, ma? Appa's friend? He has been like that from birth Only we got to know about him rather late Dai, how long will you keep discussing this? If you know someone is a wrongdoer, you shouldn't harp on it, just let go How can we let go? Think he'll stop his plans because you opposed this factory He is moving everything legally We should also get a stay legally Big deal 'legal'? Even if we take that route- Uncle, only if we get a stay in your name, you have to run from pillar to post Let us get the stay in your son's name Vanakkam, leader Vanakkam, Thamizh Please take a seat - How are you, sir? - Good, tell me I've been warning you from the beginning Kuzhandhai is a bad apple You were the only one who trusted him and embraced him as your good friend What happened now? Just tell me why you are here Nothing much My leader wanted me to meet you and get your support I'm not in a position to talk about support now You can please leav- Listen to me Both of us can- Hasn't he made it very clear? No, Thamizh, how can he build a factory disregarding our objection? We'll take care of that You get going Okay Lady Luck will knock at your door only once, kindly think and then decide I'll take leave, sir Stupid of me to have thought I can line my pocket helping them I hate these mediators and party volunteers, pa! Now all these politicians will step in here asking you to support them In the end only our family and our townsfolk will be the worst sufferers Please take a stand, uncle What decision can I take, dear? Stand against him in this election Let's see Is this a game? To impulsively compete and contest? He has the authority already Plus enough money power Don't you know what happens when power and money merge? Who gave him the power?

And what was he doing? 'He has a valid point' Let me test him Listen to me, tell me the truth without pushing it under the rug I'll come clean Who are you in this house? I am the servant here Thamizh fled to Bombay from here and stayed there for 3 months Beat up a gang of rowdies to a pulp He took a bus to Pakistan and shot all the terrorists over there! He came via the sea to Chennai and knocked down all the politicians and thugs - After that? - Then he got homesick He made a beeline back home Is that all? I imagined the worst and had nightmares Even I thought you will be my worst nightmare! - Hello? - Now what? Okay, what were you doing? If you are a servant you stick to that Not think of yourself as James Bond The hero won't like it if you do so 'What audacity!' 'Where did you pick him up? He is 101% carbon copy, sir' His family believed his story People of this town fell for it 'Our party took his word for gospel' He is on his way to meet Kuzhandhai If Kuzhandhai also swallows his story- Vanakkam, uncle How are you? - Who the hell are you? - That isn't relevant now When someone greets you learn to return the gesture Sir, I think he found out I'm duplicate, let's scoot now Why do you jump to conclusions? You let your charisma flow I'm there to support you - Who are you? - You guessed right, I'm not Thamizh - Sir? - Waitees But I'll do twice the good Thamizh will do for this town I've been getting to know the townsfolk for the past few days What loving care, concern and gratitude You're betraying your own people grasping for some pipedream Is this fair on your part? Do you think of yourself as Thamizh? We buy a mobile for 100000 But the same duplicate mobile is available in the market Don't I know the plus and minus of the original and duplicate? - Sir - What, sir? He speaks like a phone mechanic Maybe he is one! You're right I am a duplicate But a duplicate phone heats up very fast And head will explode You may roam around with 'posh and class' But you don't know my skill en masse, right? Kuzhandhai Wait and watch! 'Take pictures of our town?' '- Village photography is my project - Why is she here?' 'She has come to snitch on you' - When did you come? - Hi Thamizh, hi bro Ma, I need some time alone To talk personally - Thamizh go and talk - No, it's okay - Aunt - 'Amma, let us go in' Madcap! What will my aunt think of us? You forgot your town You even forgot your name As if it's that tough to forget me?! Not like that- Don't be scared I told everyone you are my friend and I'm here to work on my project I fell in love with Murugan I'll learn to live with Thamizh 'Murugan, huh?' Take her suitcase inside, da Shall we talk as we go? Who is that girl? Says she fell in love with Murugan and she'll learn to live with Thamizh What is happening here? 'How do I cover up now?' Let me explain This girl fell in love with Murugan - Who is Murugan? - God - Which place? - Tamil Nadu So Thamizh and Murugan are linked Since Thamizh looks like Murugan she says she'll live with Thamizh 'He fell for my yarn' Is that all? I imagined the worst and thought I'll get nightmares! You have an uncanny habit of grasping like camphor catches fire! Then what? Can I lead a good life? Only in this house the servant doubles up as James Bond! James Bond! Wash the tumbler and make me a good cup of coffee Will you ask me any more questions? 'Govt Hospital Maruthamangalam' Hospital has a new look now You should've seen the hell hole we had! Two of you hold it Stop it...stop it right there Who gave you permission to unload private equipment in a Govt hospital?

What should I do now, sir? People are facing an issue Go and resolve it for them People's leader People's spokesman I'll come when I should, sir - Everything is wrong - Tamil Nadu is waiting Everything is in place Otherwise Thamizh won't get involved - What have you studied? - IAS - Do you know to read English? - Of course Give that to me Here...read this These equipment should have reached this hospital 6 months ago - You've signed this - Me? Your name is Sadhasivam? Isn't that your signature? - Yes - That's all Problem solved You can go Are you here to create a problem?

I lost my heart to him that very minute! Hero of 'Thotti Jaya' is Simbu, right? You should feel shy and smile like this looking at him, no?

Get lost, man! If you had asked me when I came to see you ...I would've myself told you A to Z and given my Govt ID in your hands Instead you think you're Poirot Asking me 'How are you, Murugan?' What is this act, huh? You really have a silver tongue Even the Smart Alec Thamizh couldn't cope with my political moves You're just an ordinary actor As far as you're concerned politics is money, power and authority But to me it is duty, responsibility and trust Shall we see which wins?

He will strike back So should this town stagnate like this? Seeing the people's reaction looks like we are in danger Before they turn violent let's apologize and leave this place silently And where do we go? They've come trusting us We have to respond What is our reply? Life or death Let my people decide No need, don't go Thamizh, I believe your girlfriend is the daughter of that factory owner Kuzhandhai is announcing this all over our town You intend marrying her it seems and the factory will be built here We are not suspicious of you, Thamizh You are like a son to all of us 'How will we doubt our own child?' How will you have the heart to backstab us, bro? If a factory is constructed here because of you and we die ...we'll consider it a privilege, son - Bro...please - 'Listen, Thamizh' People will tend to gossip adding 4 + 4 as 5 'Don't take it to heart' We wanted to assure you to be strong And tell you we are with you What do you say? Yes Your daughter's problem is the talk of the town Sir, if the case is not withdrawn this time ...the stay is confirmed, sir Tell me, Vinoth Thamizh anna, the children in this school who ate the midday meal have been poisoned 'I'm so scared Come soon, bro' Hey!

To cast a vote in my favor! 'I think this is enough for now' Sir, just 1 question - Your shirt is torn - Blood stains Aiyaiyo! Listen, everyone Thamizh has hacked our leader's arm - Come and help - Move aside I'm alright Don't worry I strongly condemn the atrocity meted out to my party candidate Kuzhandhaivel Should the opposition go to the extent of murder fearing defeat in the election? The police force should immediately arrest independent candidate Thamizh He has shed his blood and sweat for Maruthamangalam constituency He will recover and work for the welfare of the people and his constituency Bro, confirmed, we will ace this election 'The by-election in Maruthamalai is due within the next few days' 'Mr Kuzhandhaivel, ex-MLA and candidate of People's Progressive Party' '...has been assaulted in his residence by Sangathamizhan, his opposing candidate' 'Vanakkam, sir' You've become talk of the town in 1 day, Kuzhandhai?

Only now I feel I'm seeing the Thamizh I know Murugan! You have a problem confront me directly What did those poor people do? Showing your bravery on innocent children and elders - Aren't you ashamed? - What can I do? Those brainless people trust you I decided right then I should not target you But aim at those people If you want to protect the welfare of the people ...withdraw your nomination and leave this town at once I can slit your neck this very minute I will rob you of the same money, power and authority you want to grab for yourself And make you stand in the middle of the road, want to see me do it? If you call yourself a man... ...do whatever fraudulent dealings you are capable of And show me you can win this election Meet you at the arena The media witnessed you entering and exiting in anger from the ex-MLA's house Are you denying it? So you will trust me if there is strong evidence? For sure, sir Move aside for the police force Sir, please give me your WhatsApp #? - What for? - I have a task to complete 99421 98999 Why say it so menacingly? Show some respect Take a look at your phone 'He spoke and walked away Why are you just gawking at him?' 'He barged in and chopped my arm' 'You are being a silent witness' 'The members of the Press standing outside didn't see this' 'Even you didn't see it?' 'Chop my arm' 'How can I do that to you, bro?' 'Do as I say' Hey! Our leader Ssssh! Let me talk Tell me, sir Yov! What have you done? - No, sir, please hear me out - Hey! Why should I listen to you? Shut up and listen to me first 'Kuzhandhaivel's drama of chopping his own arm' '...has created a stir in political circles' 'I dismiss Kuzhandhaivel from the Party on a permanent basis' 'Hereafter there's no connection whatsoever between Kuzhandhaivel and Party volunteers' 'Does that terrify you?' 'Are you petrified?' 'If you toe the line and sign the documents' '...you can step out with your life intact' Otherwise I can't guarantee for your lives at all No one is around to crash the gates and barge in Thamizh who is your savior isn't alive either Sorry You aren't aware, right? 'The man you think is Thamizh' ...is Murugan! He is the coolie I have planted He's a fantastic actor He conned the whole town He deceived his own family He was even able to make all his friends believe in his duplicity Every single person All - are - stupid - idiots! Are we the idiots? Don't let your tongue run, sir You are wrong if you think he is Murugan He is our Thamizh anna Careful, take her Kavya! Anna? - How are you? - I'm good How are you? I'm fine I've betrayed you so much, Thamizh But you saved my daughter I'll be loyal to you till my last breath, Thamizh Please forgive me, Thamizh Take care of your child You think you brought him here? He came here through you! 'Dubai' 'Murugan worked with Thamizha anna in Dubai' 'His friend' 'Thamizh anna lived as Muruga in his house in Chennai' 'His family is aware of everything' 'He visited that pub only to meet your daughter' 'He created a deep impact in your daughter's mind' - I'm really proud of you, Thamizh - Thank you, sir Take Gopi to Bombay No one should suspect anything I'll handle this, Thamizh Instead of creating a scene call your dad now 'Sangathamizhan' 'If he wanted to seek revenge he could have killed you long ago' 'With the same legal loopholes through which you entered' 'He was waiting to turn the tables on you' 'He returned as Sangathamizhan to his hometown' Good show So if you are alive ...the factory won't be constructed Where is Thamizh? 'Listen to me patiently' 'Think and then decide' 'Only if need be lose your temper!' I totally underestimated you I didn't expect you to grow in stature and stand before me so soon You know if God has decided to send someone as godsend ...even if you try to shut the gate and lock it up, the lock won't work! 'Want to know why?' Because HE holds the key! "Hey there! Move, dude I will rip your ears into two" "Who came spoiling for a fight? I'm king of blows; to wrong the right" "Eruptive Explosive" "Even fear will flee; terrified with a glimpse of him, petrified" Will you sign at least now? Or shall I kill you and then use your thumbprints? Anna...! Let go I'm alright Come What the hell? Hey! You backstabbed your homeland and your own people for some random stranger It's a sin to even touch you Come on 'In the given time allotted by the Court' 'Since Sanjay Industries was unable to justify its actions' 'And based on inquiries' '...it has been proved beyond doubt this copper factory will pollute' '...the environment and surroundings' 'Any industrial firm should function only for the welfare of the people' 'Bearing in mind it should not be for the personal gain of any individual' '...this Court has banned operations of Sanjay Industries on a permanent basis' 'Further the Court orders the owner to return land(s) acquired from individuals' 'What is your comment on your victory?' This isn't an individual's victory This is the reward for the unity of my people Having enforced a ban here, can you affirm the same even in Tamil Nadu? I am not an astrologer! If the people in other cities and towns are as united as my people here ...they will get only what they aspire for I believe no one can thrust what they don't like Are you implying political heads duly elected by the people ...are committing these crimes? I feel there is no use pointing fingers at who is right and who is wrong Because if that is our intention ...we can do it lifelong It doesn't give room for progress So what are you trying to say? I have a lot of work to catch up on Let me attend to it, thank you Vanakkam Muruga, how are you? Thamizh, you achieved it! I should really thank you Thank you very much Not only did he fool me but tricked you too, right? He didn't fool me Height of loyalty! You love me That's true, right? Do what your heart tells you, Thamizh I'm there for you You achieved your goal - How are you, bro-in-law? - So proud of you Keep chatting, I'll be back - Okay, Mr Gambler? - Very happy indeed! Wow! How did you accomplish all you had to and now you stand here so silently? Don't pull cuss words out of my mouth! You kept projecting me as hero and you grabbed the title!
