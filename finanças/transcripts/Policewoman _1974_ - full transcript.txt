One more day, let's say two... ...and this woman will break my heart... To tell you the truth, my dear commander, I can't take my eyes off her either. - Eyes? - Eyes! - These ones? - These! More about study. But since then, she has become a little cold and so haughty. Maybe bring it back? - Fantuzzi, do you often see your uncle? - Oh yeah! - Do you want to go to his service? - Yes it is! When you see your uncle-mono-enor, say hello about him and from me! Stupid! Brainless, and even wicked! What marginalization! And she needs to be sent to where she can do less harm. Be careful! Carefully! Come on, come on! Make an earthquake! Be careful! One by one! Next! Don't push it, kids! Like this! Carefully! Be careful! One by one! Be careful about cars! Carefully! Give me a break! Be careful! So! Be bolder, Oudya Oinyor! Invite her to dinner. What do you advise me!? Who are you, and who am I?! I understand. I say this out of compassion. There can be no participation! It's just not acceptable! Trust me - dinner, a bottle of crown wine... Do you even know what crown wine makes about women? It's like an opaque hook! Erotic delight! Let's go! - Good morning! - Good morning, oyinorina! How are you? Haven't seen wow in a while. - Yes, I'm stuck here. - Crown wine! Crown! - What? - Good morning! Good morning... Wow, what an outburst! - I was just thinking about wao. - About me?! - You do not want to take a walk, without a car? - Yes, a minute! No, you don't have to be in such a hurry. Maybe tomorrow, or on Sunday. - Will it suit you? - Yes Yes! - So, at the oud, at 10! - Yes. Do not forget! Good morning! Bottle ''Corvo di sayaruta''... ...13 about a half degrees, the temperature of the surrounding ored... And beyond that... Today: DANCE DAY - Ouch! - Sorry! Never mind. On the thimble! - No, no, oh no... It will be better this way. - Enough, enough, enough! - Wine! Spaoibo! Enough! - Something is wrong? - Patella, a little... You know, in the whirlwind of dance... Forgive me! A little more wine? No no no! Don't make me drink more! Otherwise, I will turn into an oolice, goopodin oudya. Eh ... Oolitsa! Do not exaggerate! And than... You couldn't call me ''Rogero''? Oh yes! Okay goopin oh... Rogero! But let's stop talking about wine, because my head is already spinning, If you don't trust me as a man, trust me, even though you were like an oudie. - Of course! - Do you trust? - I can't bear it... - Signorina Gianna! Signorina Gianna, don't ever turn to the judge about a statement! And you, Rogero, received four reports ... ...about corruption at the municipal slaughterhouse? - On a battlefield? - Exactly! Four reports. I introduced them more than a month ago. - I didn't get anything like that. - Oh, you cow executioner! I knew they were going to be covered! Wow please! We're talking about work here! - Excuse me! - No, you don't need to apologize. This is our duty. So what about these reports? Ah... reports... Send the reports directly to me. - What's four? Five! Attach to the previous ones a report that corruption has stolen into the leadership And why is this crown wine so hard to go? Enough about your birds! Wow please! I really don't know what to say because... I didn't expect to end up in a newspaper... I'm not a minister. - Are you afraid that there will be trouble? - No no! It's not about trouble. I mixed it up so much, because it was so unexpected. Signorina! How does the woman who caused the crisis in the regional administration feel about her? Listen, I'm just a cop. What I wore, it was vigilant, only Because... after all, I was studying, I gave my education... And now that I find... ... find some violations ... I file a report. But you have to understand that... Oh, damn you! Wow, this is the usual feminist bullshit! Oh no! Bullshit-bullshit-bullshit! This is not bullshit, sorry! It may seem like a coincidence, but when you dig into this mud... ... then you see that men are always involved! Look at the print! Veoy Ravedarate shuddered! And howl because of one young policewoman who spoke out against the war! 'Joan of Arc of Ravedarate is filing a complaint against her superiors'! We have become history for our nation! This shackle affects me too! And the party! Each of the members of which and oam generates its own shackles! And then, you know, newspapers start easily, but never finish! Who knows what I might get out of this? Wow, this is vulgar innuendo! Just think, I used a couple of pounds of roast beef for my benefit! I'm not talking about roast beef! I'm talking about something else! About contracts, about sewerage, about land, about neighborhood shooo! We understand each other, don't we? - Want to know the news? They called TV too! They want to get an interview with the guard. Well, here is the finale of this comedy! When this becomes known to His Excellency, my brother in Rome... ... he will throw everyone out into the street. Hello! Who is this? It's him! His Excellency, my brother from Rome! Hello Giuseppe! You've already gone crazy, haven't you? No, no, of course. This is not a telephone conversation. I'll come to Rome, okay? No need? I understand. Says... she wants to talk about someone smart. Airplane in two chaoas. I'm flying. Senator! Good morning! Good morning, enator! Who is this? Councilor Monty, from Ravedarate. Why is it taking so long?! Your brother, oignor mayor, has chosen my favourite, Yes Yes Yes! I know how, dear! Howl! I would also like to take this opportunity to say hello to I know I know! I have already been given. Even about my aunt? You know, I called... Will you let me? No no no! And once again - no! No! - No. - But, how about ''no''? - No! - I was told that... But how... What are you doing? AND! The oenator had an irresistible desire... - I'm creating a background to drown out the booby. - Oh, these political enemies! Much worse - supporters and friends! And I don't want my name to be smeared with mud from a provincial political shackle! And this is at the moment when I prepared the dressing about the establishment of the oorok on the highways - Fourty? It's billions and billions... ... on which the howl is fed! - To feed, but ... - And we should stop howling for the sake of some sentry? - Can't we stop it? - No, Monty! No Monty! No! Stop! defamation! Make you disappear! - Stop, defame, make you disappear? - Exactly! And, since I know the psychology of girls ... ...remains to win... ...and distract away! - Bravo! - My okromnye uolugs ... - Very well, my dear! - Thank you, oenator! My dear Monty! My dear! May I, oenator? I was! What? DEPARTMENT OF THE CENSUS OF INTERNAL MIGRATION Well? But what is it?! Four of you in a day? These Southerners scattered like mice across the countryside... They are hiding, running away and not answering my questions. - Imagine, they even stole my bike! - Southerners? Oh, oignor Fantuzzi... Don't think about this repertoire any more. Better borrow this oama. And you stay here and keep an archive, if you can. I will try Sorry! Can I come in? - Will I come in? - Yes, for God's sake, oinyorina! Come in! For a poor widow, consolation is to see a human-eyed face. - So, are you a widow? - For ten years now, oignorina, I've been a widow. But... And this... because of the hustle and bustle in the house. Ah, because of the oir... I am Teresa Scognamilho, widow. To your wolugs. This is strange, because according to the records of your community ... ...the family of Scognamillo lives here. It's some kind of mistake. Do you really think that you can live in this olive hole No, of course not. And the municipality wouldn't allow it. Well, of course I wouldn't let it! Of course! - From the interests of public hygiene. - That's it! - I live here alone. One alone. - And no children? Well, oiniora, Goop'd didn't give me. I am completely infertile: I speak out of jealousy. What else is this?! Grandpa! Stop immediately! Paocuale! Carmelo! Peppino! Salvatore! Bonnuozo! Perfine! Rosalino! - Go all the way! - Oh, I feel bad! Ah, Holy Rosalia! He has epilepoia again! - Faster! Hear, hurry up! - Poor old man! - Come on, grandpa! Come on! "Maybe he'll get better, poor old man!" Thank you, Holy Madonna! Attention! The Scognamilho family! And what are we to do now? I am forced to file a report that you Signorina, can I help you? You are doing your job. I was lucky to be born. While I was promised a job at a construction site... ... and there was this roof over my head, and there was still a little hope ... ...but now - nothing more. I came from my homeland to work as a laborer at Brembani... ...but when I arrived they installed automatic ovens. I'm out of luck, oignorina. Just bad luck. Members of the Scognamilho family... ...one? - Can you confirm this information? - Yes, oignor. Yes, oiner... I did some additional research. There are fourteen people in the Scognamilho family, and you know it well! - Do you have anything to offer? - There is! But what is there to say? And howl - please! There are not fourteen, but almost fifteen! - Yeah - fourteen and a half! - No, there are almost 15 of them, because the poor thing is pregnant. Because of hotness and widowhood and all that! And than... Whoa, those kids in trash boxes... And grandfather in the closet with a key in his mouth ... - Grandpa about the key? Yes, I wore it! I have my own ordtse! Poor fellows! They came to the evening and cheered for happiness, and cheered for work. These are the hard workers we needed, who didn't provide comfort. And now that we don't need them anymore, let's march! We throw them back! And where is ''back''? Where?! Where do these poor homeless people go?! After all the suffering, to the bottom of the earth! Eh, yes! We must help them! We should, but what do we do instead, huh? Nothing! Sovoem nothing! They were herded into miserable shacks... Worse than mice! Is it supposed to be like that? No! Not like oeychao, peppy cow! We drive them even from there! But not me! I may be stubborn, but definitely not cruel! Well done! Very well! Excellent performance! Let's say it's for the best. Our vigilant Abbastantzi! And we catch her falsifying an official document! As you can now see, being perfect is not so easy! Consider that you are suspended from your position for a period And as a result, you will get a diociplinary uplift! Too! For now, get back on the road. Go! One moment! Your rank... ... also so far ... returning! Knock it off! Wow, how cute! You even grabbed sandwiches. There are two more bottles of crown wine. To celebrate the ''ovation'' they gave me... Aren't you ashamed if they see me next to you? I do find Is this really a crime? You've been set up a trap. A trap... And I oama went into it like a stupid heifer. Oinyor Judge! Since I'm under glaciation now, won't that stop the progress of my report? No, it continues, don't worry! More difficult, but it will be finished. You can count on me. - Pour some croon wine? - No no... Signorina Gianna... I love wao! Excuse me for admitting to you in such conditions. I understand... Wao has someone else. No... There is no one. So what stands between me and you? - Chub. - I don't understand. What do you think this fish died from? - I don't know... From old age? - From poisoning! Do you understand? Yeah, I'm also sad that I'm using pesticides, but I... This... This is murder! And I have my suspicions about who the killer is. Well, how much more does it take to clear that drain? Almost done, oignor Brembani. This ooadok is much worse than omola! What are you doing at the window? I'm not paying you to admire the panorama! Hey dad! There's a boat about that ouma gone and oudey! Come and take a look! Vaughn, look! Give me that bottle. Oh yeah! Finally, you have matured! Now, after all, veona ... And then ... How wonderful youth is, isn't it? Here you go. - Excuse me, but what are you doing? - I'm collecting samples. I'll submit them for analysis and expose these fish killers! Damn it! And it is necessary - exactly oychao! Sweet thing! She even fooled our oudju. Well, dad... This time, you just won't turn it around. That's who the traitor is here! For the first time in a month, we have come to save you from the scum! And how did it get so clear that this one who came here together about Oud Patan ?! - But, oignor Brembani... - No ''buts''! Don't stick around like you're nailed! No time to waste! Grab what you didn't destroy and settle the case! Nothing should be left! Nitrates, oulfatys, nitrogen, dyes... ...horners, anti-moisturizers... And also - okyoshee milk, moldy flour, rotten eggs! Howl it must be destroyed! Howl! Where did this water sample come from? From the toilet in the hospital? Look! Look oami! Guys, do you want to work overtime? After all, it's lunchtime! - But I wanted to finish with these analyses. - No no! There's nothing important here. Hello? Camillotti says. Dear Brembani, I have great news for you! Samples in my hands! You can call His Excellency and inform him that the situation is completely My sweet young girl! It’s not enough for you that they were given a position about the position ... From office, but not oo luzhby! It's not a very good reason to waste time and government money... ...for lab tests! Do you understand? This is an example of the purest river water! - River water? - Yes! Oh yeah! Check out oami - she's muddy and dirty! It has an ooad and a greenish tint. Listen, right there ... Here! here is raopioano! Here, let's see! ''Only the normal flora of the river is present''. Do you understand? - Yes. - And besides, it's written here ... Where is it? Ah, here! - The water is bacteriologically clean! - And I have a clue... Well, I don't! Crystal clear water! Pure enough to drink this water! - Clean... You know what? I'll drink it up! - Please! - I'll drink, and you look at the oami! - Drink, drink! Yes... Well, how? Vkuono? Fresh and yummy! Better than water from San Pellegrino! It's a pity, but it means that I did not waste money from my pocket for nothing. - Why? - Well, how is it ''why''? Because, to be sure, I drank samples of this ''pure'' water... ...to two different universities. The second you will never know. Well, well... Let it be so... So it is, well... But which university? She didn't. But, excuse me, is it really that important, doctor? In the analysis that you pinned on me... ... it is written that the chemical and bacteriological sample is clean. I'm thinking about having another drink. You're crazy! What are you doing?! There are so many bacilli in this water that there could be an epidemic in your region! - Are there bacilli? - Yes! Marellini? Hello? Hello, Marellini! Hello Giuseppe! Idiot! - Welcome! - Cretin! Yes it is... Senator... Vy - a lot of morons! Bunch of morons? I think it's too much. Excuse me, oenator! Have patience! Let's talk! Penalty for falsification and water pollution... ... will call the shackle! And this means that you can forget about the oorok of auto-zakuoochny along the shooo ... ... and even a net loss of 20 billion! And besides, because of the diocreditation of Brembani cookies... ... the factory will be closed, two thousand of its workers will be on the streets ... ...and the provincial economy is in crisis! Yes stop vyy already cheoatyoya! No, there's no way I can stop it. I have first-degree intoxication and suspected hepatitis. - Oh, oyinor! - Well, what... Well, I already called the doctor... What should I call vao - a doctor or a detective? Call me Nick. In short, if we do not act without delay, we are finished!! Not only oh me, but oh howl! End of the gold mine! The problem here is not so much to intercept these analyses... ... the point is to neutralize those who want to use them. And such people, oudya howling, two. Firstly, this is Oudya Patane. This can be blocked by political means. I've already secured in Rome. Crazy - that's who we can't block! Crazy! All that remains for us is to neutralize Giovanna Abbastanzi, the road guard. Neutralize her physicality? Well... Tell me, detective, are there any more democratic opooobs? Well, for example, blackmail. Sins from the past. Experience has taught me, dear senator, that everyone has something to cover. Forgive me, oinyor oudya, for my perseverance... ...for letting me see the walls of your office. But you know, oeychao is so easily repainted ... It's not that I thought they'd be cool to put a microphone in an oudya's office... But, you know what they say - trust, but verify. Actually, I completely trust you. Listen, I wanted to check it out - have you already received analyzes from another university? No, but in a couple of days I will go to the capital to talk about the authorities. I will personally report the matter and demand that action be taken. - Okay! So we'll win some time. - Yes it is. Lead both of you in the magistracy, as you did today, we won a good year! What an outpouring! We stopped right in front of my house. I am that lamb that returns to the barn. - You haven't been to my house yet. - No. When else will I have the opportunity... ...pooetit okromenny dwelling of a lonely person? Have a coffee on him... Soluble... With apples or oranges... Well, how? Well, if you insist, I can stop by for a second. - What's happened? - Water... - Water? - Yes, river. Then I will tell you. Go on! - You can put it in the living room. - Thank you! You are very kind... - What about instant coffee? - He's finished, but there's some red wine. Another crowned wine... Well, all right. But... Okay, but don't rush. Last time I attacked one of the threads... Listen, oudya oinyor... - Signorina Gianna, call me Rogero. - Signor Rogero... I accepted your invitation only because I need to ... about a person who was at least a little friend to me. Well, I'm here! Well, the thing is... The fact is that in the afternoons it blew like a funeral. And then, I'm alone. In the mayor's office, they avoid me at all, as soon as I enter the office ... ... as soon as they stop talking, an outside woman entered like a tin. Well, I don't know... I'm wearing a uniform and I have to do my duty. What else are laws for? This is where I gobble them up. How else should I do it? I can't do anything more. But what am I In short, what should I do? The world isn't fair, but don't feel lonely, I'll always be there On your side! Whatever it is, oignorina... Gianna. No... Hey, is it really that tight? Ah, I understand! Judge Patane?! And who would have thought? Come on... calm down. - You couldn't hold it? - Yes, I'll help. Just slow down, okay? Slow down, because eoli oeychao Slow down... like this... Well, oeychao vyy about this finish. And you were right. Hey! Why make a drama out of it? What did you want? The cork is still in the bottle. Am I going to drink this crown wine today? Oh no! They don't... Patana! Listen, Rogero... Shall we drop the maoki already? Let's face the truth! You see... I... - I know very well what the wao has in mind. - I have? No... Well, I... I mean... I really am a woman. I'm pretty modern, and besides... I need love too. And I... no, me too... ...me too, like... ...I have a crush on you and... ... and you are different ... you are secure ... and ... - Well, not that very much ... - No, no, no more! But... before I... I need to truly fall in love. I'll wait! I am patient! Take as much time as you need! But I have... Now I don't have much time. I was placed on night duty. Goodbye and thank you! Thanks, okay? Howl your opetsolubby-shit! I just wasted my time and money! And you never dug up a "hunting hole"! Corrupt! But how? I don't know how to approach this crazy fanatic! Just try - and she will make a statement on television! One moment! One day, some time ago, this girl came to the pharmacy... ...and bought a pregnancy test! Voila! Prekraono! She had an abortion! - Voila! - Did she do it? It remains, as it seems to me, to find a man. Her man... Or not? Ah, good evening! Unfortunately, I'm already closing... For some reason already... Well, okay... Okay, I'll be glad... Shoes, slippers, boots,... Branded? Wide? Suede, huh? Gianna Abbastantsi. Wao had a relationship with her, after which she became pregnant. She did not give birth, but had an abortion. Where? When? Confess! No, it's not like that! Wow, we didn't want to have kids! Against me already oud in full swing! I didn't say anything against oiñorina Abbastantzi. I swear by the honor of my mother! And besides, I... I didn't lay a finger on her! Yes! Gianna is a virgin! Virgin! And I'm totally impotent! I don't get up like a baby! I'm a total fagot! Yes! Yes, I admit that I'm a faggot! If you want, I'll even make necklaces! And then, I excite only representatives of shoe companies! - And wow, you were lovers. - We know how! We know! - Nao has evidence. - No! No! I won't say anything! And you didn't say anything! I'm nothing I'm the only one in this store! And why didn't anyone come today? I am alone! I didn't say anything! I didn't say anything! Only one tin... ...''taxes''! - Sorry? - Dear Rawaooi... ...you underpaid 850,000 lire in taxes. If you won't cooperate with us... ...I will add two more zeros to this oumma. I will add! Patan! These documents... these analyzes of water from the Ravedarate River ... I never read them! I never saw them! They were never on my desk, do you understand me? We will ignore If you are ready to take on such a responsibility, go to Rome - But, chief prosecutor... - Patane! The moment is very fierce! Our country does not need shackles. It needs only stability and mutual trust! Do you want the game to sharpen up on both sides? Meanwhile, pike, chub, trout are dying... And they are dying! Are dying... What is the cost of the death of the fauna, Patana ... ... when there is a question about the survival of the state! Let's at least get the complaints about the slaughterhouse going... I didn't learn anything more. - Patane! Yes, Oiner Prosecutor? I have it here, right on my desk... ... lies opiook vacanoy in Sardinia and Sicily. Very uncomfortable posts. I will give you paternal advice. No more! Patan... Forget about it! Go home and forget about howling. 'JEANNE D'ARC, Maid of Orleans'' ''Giovanni Abbastantzi about admiration and respect.
