[dramatic music] [energetic harmonica] [breeze blowing softly] [birds tweeting] - [Jimmy] Worked on a farm all of my life until I finished the eighth grade in school. Knocking down beds and rows for to plant cotton. I tell everybody I was growed up in the Blues. There's a whole lifetime story I could tell you, but I guess I better break it off like that. One time, I tried to get an audition with B.B. King, but he couldn't put up no room for me to stay nowhere. So I just went back home and went to work. Rattlin' round in the fields and started working in the woods. Out in the woods, I cut timber off of the Mississippi River. And that was some hard work. $5 a day. If I worked five days, I had $30 that week. Sometimes we had it hard, and sometimes we had it good. All the good days wasn't but bad days. All the bad days wasn't but good days, but anyways... I'm still here a-pluckin'. Pluckin', pluckin'. Anything can give you the blues. I heard a preacher say that, and I believe it too. You maybe go to work on Monday. "Ooh, it's a blue Monday, I feel so bad." That's the blues. Don't you think so?

This was the place in my younger days. This time of year, this time of day on Saturdays, the black guys or the ladies, they got through with the field work this time of week, they would come to the juke-joint, likes to drink, dance, have fun. And they called it juke. At one time, the place was full of musicians. And you didn't have to schedule nothing. They'd be standing sometime in line with a guitar on their back or a harmonica in their pocket. And they play it well. Sometimes they made a little tip money, and sometimes they play for a drink of liquor. Just depend. [patrons talking faintly] And then Muddy had stolen one of Howlin' Wolf's guitar players. I know about it. And Howlin' Wolf told him, "You ever steal anything else from me again, I'll kill you. "That day, you dead! I say, "What? " Let me tell you something about Howlin' Wolf. I played with him. Howlin' Wolf was a mean man. You know who was meaner? Howlin' Wolf was scared of Jimmy Reed. Oh, he was? They got into it all the time. - [Man In Blue] Oh, okay.

But this is where I write at, this where I create. When I'm alone, I'm driving. I listen to some records. Very seldom I listen to radio. But I listen to records. Some old records, some new records. You know, everything I wanna listen to, everything I think I wanna hear. I find it in records, and I play it and I reminisce and wish and hope. And this where I get my ideas from, you know. This one, the best thing could happen to me is the road. [cell phone chimes] The road is my thing. I'm doing some taping. I can't talk now. I'll call you back when I get through. Grandchildren, grandchildren. When I first started to play in Chicago in the early '50s, I had a job at the Squeeze Inn, what paid me three dollars a night. And at the Cotton Club in Argo, Illinois, I would get six dollars a weekend. Six dollars for Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Six dollars. That's two dollars a night. And I was paying the band about eight dollars. I'm talking about the whole band. I was paying Freddie King a dollar 50 cent a night. - [Interviewer] He was your guitar player back in the day? Oh, yeah. First night, how we got the gig, we did an audition. We played for the sandwiches. The man would fix us four sandwiches. And that's a hamburger. We played for a hamburger. And I would give the guys 50 cent apiece. Then we got so good, the guy would give us eight hamburgers. I would sell three of them and eat the others. And I got so good, he would give 12 hamburgers a night. We would eat four and sell the others, for 20 cent. That's our money. So we were workin' for, The Chitlin' Circuit wasn't no joke! That was the Chitlin' Circuit. Now we had moved up from chitlin' to hamburgers. [laughing] [electric blues] [crowd chattering] [man speaking under music] I ain't gonna pay for that.

Sweet! - [Rush] Tutwiler just a few miles from Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Tutwiler and Mound Bayou is a combination of two town that were dominated and controlled and run by black peoples... and blues peoples. [bluesy harmonica] It's got a great history especially for the blues and the black people who played the blues in this area. You migrated all across, because you come here to be free and play the blues. Because when you played the blues for the club, it was black people playing the blues and black people owned the clubs. And the black people were the mayor of the town who run the town. Including the gambling games and the whole bag. You come here to, to be free! Just like escape from something that you was tied up in and come here to be free. Free at last! I'm across the border line. I can do what I want to do. But tomorrow, you go back across that line and you go back to the cotton fields where the white people own them. You got to work and slave for them. But Mound Bayou was a place, Tutwiler was a place that was pretty much owned and operated by black people, with their own land.

In fact, male musicians would help me and show me how to string up my guitar. So I was playing upside down for a long time. Yeah, I was a young girl. I guess I was about, I think about 20. My dad said, "I don't think Barbara is ready. "She's still green behind the ears. "Even though she's got this hit record going. " He said, "I think you should travel with her.d" So my mother quit her job. She quit her box factory job to travel with me. That's right. I'll never forget. She came and met me at the Apollo in New York. And she took the Greyhound bus there. She finally got there on the Greyhound bus. Ever since then, she started traveling with me. And she went everywhere. People like B.B., and all of them, was calling her "Mother dear" 'cause they'd hear me call her "Mother dear. " Yes, indeed. Oh, that song took me everywhere. [man shouting] [people chattering] [marching band playing in distance] My mom sent me to the store. She said, "Sonny, go to the store for me." She called me Sonny for short. "Go to the store for Mama." I said, "Okay." So I go to the store and get butter or sugar, whatever she sent me for. After I went to the store and I was on my way back... There was two big shots had passed by in a great big Fleetwood Cadillac, and they throwed something out the window into the ditch. I said, "I wonder what that was." I see them throw something out. So when I walked on and got near where at the spot where they throwed it out, I looked down in the ditch. It was a cigar box. I said, "Wow, that might be just what I need. "Maybe I can make me a guitar out of it." [mellow music] So I brought the box on home. Cut me a hole in it and glued it up. Took me some rosin and melt it and got some soot out the chimney and stirred it up, and that made it black. So I painted my little cigar box black. I said, "Now I done made that part, what I'm-a do for a keyboard?" So I go out there to the picket fence and snatch one of the pickets off the fence and makes me a keyboard. And after I made the keyboard, I said, "I don't have any tuners on that." So I went and got me some small pieces of hickory wood. And I hewed it down with glass. I didn't have tools to work with, so I used broken glass to hew it down. ♪ Why was I born in a Mississippi town? ♪ ♪ Black man has to work just like a slave ♪ ♪ Black man in Mississippi ♪ ♪ Might as well be born dead ♪ So around 12:00, there come my daddy.

So I said, "Well, maybe, "it made a sound like that, "maybe it'll make a sound on my guitar." I goes out there and pull out one strand. The horse looked around at me. I said, "I ain't gonna bother you. "I just want one strand of your hair "out your tail, Mr. Horse." I put it on there and played a little. Well, it popped. It gone. So I go back and I pull another. And I pull another and I pull another. I wind up pull a great big bald spot in that horse's tail. I said, "Well, now I know I gonna get "another whuppin' about that." But my dad had got a couple shots of that old corn liquor. It went straight to his head, and he went out there and jumped up on its back like Roy Rogers and went out through the woods wide open.

And my mother would come up, say, "Boy!" Hit me front of the head, say, "Pick that cotton! "What you lookin' up in the sky for?"

They were gonna play that Sunday night, and... he didn't ever show up. There was a couple of guys that knew me. One of the guys was Miller Sam. He said, "She can sing."

It was just a little lounge. I didn't want to go home 'cause it's early at night, so I go to the lounge and I met this guy named Emmitt Lee. He was from New Orleans, working for McGregor men's fashion. He was selling clothes. In fact, he was working with a salesman. I met him in the club that night. Oh, man, we had such a good time. I never forgot it. I got drunk. I went home. 3:00 in the morning, I made up Emmitt Lee. He said, "I got to go." He said, "When you wake up tomorrow, I'll be gone." I said, "Oh, my goodness." I had had so much fun. I didn't want him to go. ♪ Oh, Emmitt Lee ♪ ♪ Now that you're gone ♪ ♪ I'm left here all alone ♪ ♪ I've got nobody ♪ ♪ To call my very own ♪ ♪ Emmitt Lee ♪ ♪ Don't you remember me? ♪ - [Interviewer] Did you ever see Emmitt Lee again? Yes. I was working with Joe Tex. And we played the 20 Grand in Detroit. A lady came to me and said, "Ma'am, your husband is out there. " One of the girls that worked there said, "Your husband is out there." Husband? I don't have a husband. I'm not married. He opened the door and said, "Yeah, you do. "Carol Lee, come on here to Emmitt Lee." I saw him then, and I never saw him again. He died two weeks later.

[crowd chattering under music] [train horn blowing] [crossing bell clanging] [picking note] The train was a separation. It was like the Dixie line. North and south. The train track was a separation. Community. Community was the black side or the white side. Exactly. At one time, you couldn't be caught on the north side of the tracks. North side of the track was considered where white people lived. They had that all over. It wasn't just here. It wasn't just here. But the bottom line was... That was the way of life. You was conditioned to it. That's what you had to expect. W- hen I went to Chicago, I was gonna leave the South and go to Chicago 'cause I wanted to have my freedom. And I run into a brick wall. The second club I went to, I went to Argo, Illinois. Next club I went to was a suburb of Chicago. Harvey, Illinois. Or Robbins, Illinois. I know where that is. We worked on a stage. And when we start to playin', they closed the curtain. We played all night long. They listened to our music, but they didn't want to see our face. I believe that. Yeah. I believe that. Day in and day out. Night in and night out. So finally, I got so good the guy said, "We're gonna introduce the band tonight." They introduced the band. I took a bow. They opened the curtain up, I took a bow. Closed the curtain right back up. But the band was behind me. The guy said, "We're gonna do this again, "but we got to put another curtain." They put the band behind another curtain. So I'm standing in front of the band, can't see the band. When they open it up, I take a bow so they wouldn't see the band. I take a bow. Close it back up. All night long we played, 'cause it was a white audience. They want to hear our music, but they didn't want to see our face. Day in and day out. Myself, Muddy Waters and all the guys. - [Man Offscreen] But they didn't know any better. We played, [stammering]. It was a way of life. We expected that. We have come a long ways. [muffled voice over PA] I always was a musician. From 13, 14 years old. I don't believe I worked under 200 dates for 58 years. This all right to you, baby? Hey, Bobby. Not bad, get it on, Bobby. [both laughing] Not bad, Bobby. You clean up well. Bobby, turn around. I gotta see. I like that. I like that. Now that's class. You rockin' it, Bobby. [people laughing, chattering] - [Woman Offscreen] You can come back here, Bobby. [talking over one another] What day they say that? [mumbles] I don't feel any different now than I felt when I was 20, really. But I think a little bit different. But I think a little bit different. But you have to realize and be fair with yourself. What you did when you were 20, you can't do when you're 80. And I know when I was younger, I had some bad-feeling days because I was so tired trying to make a living, trying to make a hustle, trying to go from town to town and trying to bust my brains to figure out what I should do when I didn't know there wasn't nothin' to figure out. 'Cause what you can do is what you can do. Ain't nothing to figure out. 'Cause all you can do is all you can do. So as you get older, you find out that... You find out what it's not, not what it is. And most of the time, what it's not overrides what it is. That's probably a little fuzzy to you, to understand that one, but what it is is what it is. [tense music] Seven, eight... - [Man Offscreen] Hey, Bobby, [mumbles]. - [Rush] 10. That's a thousand. That's a thousand. Thought it was short. - [Man Offscreen] How short are we? - [Man Offscreen] About $2,000. You don't want to take partial payment? No, I need 2,800 to pay the band off. - [Gray Haired Man] What are we gonna do? I don't know how much I can get out of an ATM. I don't know what kind of limits they've got, but we can go try.

They were saying what the cotton was gonna sell for, what they were gonna sell the peanuts for, what they were gonna sell the potatoes for, how much they were gonna sell them for. And I was a little boy. They didn't pay me any attention. But I could listen. And when I couldn't hear as well I had sand in one pocket and a rag in another pocket. I would throw a little sand on the table, and sometimes on their shoes. So I could wipe the men's shoes off and listen to the conversation. And I would hear what they were saying. I would hear what they were saying and bring it back to my daddy. Bring it to my daddy and tell him what they said and what they were gonna sell.
