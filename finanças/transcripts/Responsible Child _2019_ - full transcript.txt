How old are you, Rafael? I'm 12. Do you understand WHY you've been arrested? Yeah. I do. Right. An incident occurred on early Wednesday morning in which one person was murdered. Four persons were known to be at the scene at the time, one of which has been named as the detained person. Therefore, the detained person has arrived at this police station this night and has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Do you understand that? Yes. So, based on that information, I'm going to authorise your detention here to secure and preserve evidence by means of questioning. An appropriate adult is en route to custody now to support you. OK? Yes. DOOR BUZZES DOOR BANGS SHUT Yeah, but over nine frigging hours in an adult cell? It's unlawful. Where else would we put him? Did anyone try and liaise with the local authority at all? They came in at night-time. How inconvenient for the nine-to-fives. The law then stipulates each station have a child-friendly cell. He's been detained for murder, not truancy. He's still a child, but! It's a Victorian building, Pete. Yeah, Victorian's fucking right. What kept you so long, anyway? Some brainiac upstairs put both brothers in with the same firm. DOOR BANGS SHUT Well, now. I'm Pete. Your solicitor. Which means I'm going to guide you through this. Now, I know I'm a bit dodgy-looking, like, but, erm, may I? I bet you prefer being called Ray. Huh? I'll let you in on a little something. My full name? Petrotheus. On my life. Literally. You eaten? Ah! Well, let's see what we can... Ta-da! It's not quite a rabbit, I know. But, erm... Go on. There's one for you, too. DOOR OPENS I'm in private consultation with my client. Yeah, OK. I'll, er... I'll see you shortly, Rafael. Yep. Appropriate adult. Can't trust him. Bound by law. So, like, something you said, that he heard, could be used against you in court. Say nothing. Except to me. OK? Now... ..we're going to need to prepare a statement. So that, in an interview, all you need to say to their questions is, "No comment." OK? Grand. PHONE RINGS I'm not interested. Good afternoon yourself. Now, Kerry, I have something that I think you'll... Look, I still haven't been paid for that last fucking legal aid fiasco. Murder. Yeah, it might well come to it, Pete. A child. Murdered? No. Murderer. Needs a barrister. Ah, I've got you, haven't I? Go on. Well, you'd think the boy had fallen off a cloud, while the murder itself is as brutal, Kerry, seriously, as I've ever seen. Look, I have to go back in now, but I'll call you later, OK? OK. All right. Your statement says you found your dad's drinking and temper impossible to live with any more, so on 15th June last year, you packed some bags after school and left to go and stay with your mum and older brother, is that right? LAUGHTER AND CHATTER Hi. Hey... Hey. Hey, what's...? I can't stay with Dad any more. Who's that at this time? Don't worry about him. OK? Hello, Ray. Hey, Mum. Bit late for a visit, Ray. Yeah. Erm... Yeah, he was, erm, going to stay. If that's OK, Scott? Well, for tonight? Yeah. The sofa OK? No, for, erm... ..for a bit longer, maybe. We ain't got the room, Ray. Sorry, mate. Look, stay tonight. But then back to your dad's tomorrow, yeah? He can't go back there. Mum? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you calling her for? It's her... It's her house. "It's her house". It's the freaking council's. In my name. Yeah. Mine on all the bills. Can barely afford to feed our own already, let alone that waste of fucking space. Don't call my brother that. Look, it's our mum's house, yeah? And Ray's got nowhere else. So... Piss off back to your dad's with him! I'm not leaving you here alone with Mum. What did you say? Nathan didn't say anything. In my own home. After a day's graft, struggling to keep a roof over my family, and he's fucking telling me this and that?! It's OK. Hold on. I'll sort it. OK? Don't you ever speak to me like that again! Look, I'm just trying to help my brother, cos he's got nowhere else to live. Well, why won't you leave me alone with your mum? You know why I'm not going to leave you alone with her. Why? Why? Cos I've seen exactly what you're like. I'll fucking... I'm going to fucking kill you! Oh! What you...? If you'd just care to sign it for me? Thank you. We'll be in touch. Cheers. Please. That's my family home. That's my home. I was glad to see your name down. Right back at you, darling. You been all right? Oh, keeping on, you know? Now, I'm going to briefly introduce you to Miss Stephens, who's going to be your defence barrister, along with the rest of your team, all right? Now, today is not really about your case, as such, it's just about... Well, now. Kerry. How are you? Hello, Pete. This is Ray. Hello, Ray. I'm Kerry. I will be your defence throughout. If you don't like me, don't trust me, Pete will find you someone else. Good. Now... ..this is Gary from the Youth Offending Team. All right, mate? He is responsible for overseeing your case up until sentence. And this... Grace. From Children's Services. Right, guys. Let's crack on. Ray? She's a wee bit full-on, but she'll fight to her shadow for you. Now, we need to prepare for your preliminary hearing. The police are looking to up Scott's charges, so he could be in custody for a while. It's just you with the kids for the time being. We know you've had some bonding issues there in the past. Please don't take another baby. Now, Veronica, that was a long time ago and you've been doing really well with things since. All right? We just want to make sure you're coping now that Scott isn't here to help with looking after the little ones. That is all the assessment is about. Thought you were at work? Oh, I'm going in later. He's not getting bail, you know. Yeah, I know. I know. Do you want to play some Days Of Battle? "Be brave as the shadows close upon you "for we shall endure until light returns once more!" In a bit, Ray. OK? Affirmative. What a good boy. VIDEO GAME: Be brave as the shadows close upon you, for we shall endure until the light returns once more. KNOCK ON DOOR Stealth, my son. You're done. PETE: So you're saying we're not going to do anything unless he doesn't remand him to the care of the local authority? You OK? Court rise. Please stand. Rafael McCullin. I can't tell you how desperately sad I find it to see you stand here today accused of murdering a man. And brutally. Having looked over everything to hand up to this point, I am remanding you into local authority foster care until this comes to trial. Do you understand me? Erm... ..yeah. Yes, your honour. Yes, Your Honour. Nathaniel McCullin. You will be held on remand until the trial. But we'll stay in the same place. Won't we, Pete? But we have to. Can you ask him, please? Court rise. Come on. Down you get. There you go. Do you want to...? Right, wait there. Yeah, one, two... See you later, OK, Mum? "The little 'uns pushed Percival forward, then left him by himself. "He stood knee deep in the central grass, "looking at his hidden feet, trying to pretend..." Sorry I'm late. For, like, the zillionth time. PUPILS LAUGH OK, thank you. Ray, can you wait behind after, please? Dalbinder, can you share with Ray, please? And, Gemma, pick up. Does something smell like shit round here? PUPILS LAUGH OK, that's enough! Thank you. Gemma. "Ralph remembered another small boy who had stood like this "and he flinched away from the memory. "He had pushed through, erm... "He had pushed the thought down and out of sight." So, er, services have updated us on the Crown upping your step-dad's charge to attempted murder. How are you feeling about it all? Is your mum coping all right? Yeah? What about your older brother? Is he OK? Ray? Well, I'm going to have to put you on attendance report, Ray. Nathan's fine. We're all fine. Thank you. OK. Well... A special school grant might help a little bit? Please? Just get yourself some clothes for mufti day, or something. Yeah? HE GIGGLES Sorry. CLATTER You all right in there, Mum? I left them to re-heat too long. They're all right. Bon appetito! Oh, thanks. That kid's got to be CGI. I mean, pulling moves like that? Or a robot. Yeah, yeah. Like some sick psycho robot kid that breakdances the judges to bits. I don't want this psych test messing with the boy's head. He's in a vulnerable enough state already. I know. Hi. I'd like us to have a chat alone first. If that's OK with you, Rafael? Do you know why you're here, Rafael? Erm... ..to see if I'm OK for the trial. Yeah. Good. Fit to plead. I get lost in that. The universe. It's like the mind. Our own unknowable. It's called the Pillars of Creation. Well, that's wonderful. Thank you. Are you keen on space, then? Erm... I like, erm... ..astronomy. Yeah. Of course. So, do you miss school? A bit. Did you ever get in any fights? Erm, not really. Erm... ..one. And what happened? Did you win? Got broken up. Got suspended. Would you like to talk about it? I crushed a ladybird. I killed it. Because you got suspended? No. Erm, I don't know. OK. So, how does that make you feel? On a scale of one to ten, one being great, ten being terrible. Erm... ..like, nine? Right. So, why does that make you feel so terrible, do you think? Cos it didn't deserve it. It didn't do anything wrong. I killed it. Does anything make you feel ten? My brother... ..Nathan. And Christie. And Serena. And Mum. And Scott? What happened? Does that make you feel ten, too? Nine, then? Eight? OK. All right. I can give you some strategies for now for when you feel like that. Breathing exercises. OK? Rafael has expressed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. He is only just beginning to remember the murder. Fragments. But he isn't ready to address it. Address? In what way? Rafael refuses to accept any liability for the murder. Rather, that it was the deceased's fault. And what do you make of him? Well, I'll need to make my report. Informally? He has no obvious psychopathic traits. He displays clear empathy and sensitivity. And how might he come across? The child in court? Well... He's intelligent, articulate... ..but reserved. Self-contained. Add the pressure of the setting... So callous. Devious. Not damaged enough, outwardly. You know, if Rafael was tried through the Youth Courts, the decision would lie solely with the judge, who would make a decision based on all aspects of this child's life. But this is murder. And he has to face a jury. So, we try a child as young as ten... ..who isn't, by law, allowed to buy a pet bloody hamster until he's 16, as an adult? Well, we have no in between here, so... Look, he's just lucky to have you both fighting his corner. Not all the kids I see here are, I tell you. Is there else anything we can use? PTSD? You mentioned Ray had... Repercussions of the act. Also possibly from other accumulated experiences of violence. Any other mitigating factors? You look surprised to see me. The court didn't believe your brother. Been acquitted. Ray, this is my home. And there is no way you and your brother are getting rid of me again. Those for the little 'uns? Oh, look at you two! I have missed you two little munchkins so much! Come here! Fuck off. What you got there? Go away. Go away! I ain't going nowhere, mate. Go away! Go away! Go away! You go. Go away! Going nowhere, mate. Go away! Going nowhere. I just can't. This can't be real... The man was asleep on the sofa. They went down those stairs to kill him. It's pre-meditation. End of. Because of what their mother had told Nathan, that Scott was going to... Finish the job. Right. For which we only have Nathan and Veronica's words. And I am not putting his mother in the witness box, and as for him... Christ. Poor fella was in a heck of a state, all right. His crowd will surely show that. It's their ace. And ours, too. Maybe. Ray sees big, beloved brother in the doorway, in that state, saying he's in imminent danger for his life, added to the experience of the earlier trauma, building... Where there is a fear of serious violence, it needs to be in respect of violence against the defendant or another identified person. Aka Nathan. It's a shot in the dark that the prosecution will tear right into, but the loss of control needn't be in the moment. If we can show it built up over time, we're in with a chance. Here comes trouble. Hasn't a clue what's about to hit him. Ray, because of your age, the Crown has certain concessions it can make. Would you prefer to sit with your legal team, with us, or on your own? You, please, but what about Nathan? His team will look after him. We need... You need... Ray, look at me when I'm talking to you, please. Thank you. You need to focus on you now. No-one else. It's very important, Ray. In a few days, you're going to be sat in court with everyone looking at you like you're Dracula's son. You need to be ready. Yeah, OK. The Crown will push hard for murder. What's the difference? Between manslaughter and murder? Ten years plus in prison, maybe. If you were a 30-year-old man with the mind of someone your age, you would be judged not fit for trial. But you're not, Ray. I will fight to get you as much of a life as possible. But I need you to be strong for me. OK? So we're going with loss of control. And what will really help this defence, we hope, is Nathan giving evidence, saying he came into your room that night, is that right? Yeah. He says he was in immediate fear for his life, so you felt you had no other choice but to go down those stairs with him. Is that what happened? Yeah, it was. OK, Ray. Good. And so then... ..you lost control, did you? Right. VIDEO GAME: Stealth, my son. Now stay sharp. They're coming in from all sides. MUFFLED SHOUTING VERONICA: They need somewhere to stay, Scott. MUFFLED ARGUING SCOTT: Those boys tried to get me put away! They're my boys! Now Nathan's stuck up in that loft, laughing down at me! And he'd better stay up there if he knows what's good for him. The only place I can get some peace is that bloody shed! And that's MY space! You're sat just here, OK? All rise. Before this trial can formally begin, a request has been made that Section 39 press reporting restrictions be lifted. Your Honour? And I must agree. The sheer ferocity of the attack leaves it in the public's best interest I do so. But naming the boy leaves his whole future marked, let alone his case. It is final, Miss Stephens. Call the jury, please. Be brave as the shadows close upon you. For we shall endure until light returns once more. Will the accused please stand? Stand up. Rafael Jack McCullin, you stand accused of the murder of Scott Adam Jameson, and are pleading not guilty. You may now sit down. Nathaniel Martin McCullin, you also stand accused of the murder of Scott Adam Jameson, and are pleading not guilty. You may now sit down. This was a horrific, merciless attack on a defenceless sleeping man, yet both defendants are putting forward a partial defence. Loss of control. Reducing murder to manslaughter, arguing, on that night, the brothers acted out of an immediate fear for their lives. The Crown will expose a cold-blooded murder... ..borne out of anger. Pure premeditated revenge. And so we must also ask, what was discussed in Rafael's room? What went on behind that door, before they then went down those stairs and savagely killed their unwitting step-father? Murder or manslaughter? Revenge? Or loss of control? Oh, look at his outfit! Oh, my days. Check out his grandad's cardigan. Dickhead! Absolute wrong 'un, he is. Why are you still wearing uniform? All right, smell? What did you say to me? ALL: Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! I've got two home visits to get in still. Sorry, Amber. Ali. KNOCK ON DOOR Come on in. Grab a seat. Thank you. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Harder to get out the house than woodworm, this one. What you fighting for, eh? So, the school have called the multi-agency meeting because we're concerned about the effects on Ray and his siblings of your return to the home, Mr Jameson. Children's Services, as you know, no longer believe the children are children in need. Well, we feel that things have improved significantly in the home since Mr Jameson's return, particularly for the younger children, who seem much more settled, again as a consequence. Well, Ray isn't more settled, as the incident at lunchtime clearly attests. The altercation in the home was with the older brother? Yeah, but the trauma of the incident for Ray alone... Trauma? Ray? What trauma? Don't know. He had a scrap, is all. Just a scrap. Nathaniel's still living in the home. Is that right, Veronica? Everything's all right now. The Queen herself said so, or else I would not be sitting here. VERONICA: Everything's OK now. Well, I would like to ask Ray. Ray? Is everything all right at home now? A series of 57 stabs wounds to the back, varying depths. 12 longer, deeper wounds to the upper-right chest. A number punctured the right lung. A prolonged attempt to decapitate the head, all arteries severed, only a small section of skin left connecting it to the body. Many slash wounds to palms of hands. All defensive injuries. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. DOOR CLOSES Kerry. Where's Ray? Ah, hey... Is there anything you'd care to say? Come on, Ray, inside. Would you kindly piss off? Everyone will know now. Eat. Where's my big brother gone? I don't know. Well, get him back! Get him back! THUDDING SCOTT: Look at the...look at the state! Look at the state of this place! Why am I working so hard for us all, eh?! VERONICA: Calm...calm down. Calm?! Don't tell me to be calm! When this place is a tip, and they're still living here! They're doing nothing but taking the piss! You don't have to stay here. What did you just say to me? Don't you ever... Don't you ever speak to me like that again, do you hear me? In my own house! It's all fucking down to me! You don't lift a finger, do you?! It's all down to me! Nothing ever fucking changes! You don't do anything, woman! You don't lift a finger! And as for you... Come down here, you useless prick! Get yourself down here now! Come on! Ah! I thought not! We have established Nathaniel in some sorry state of depression, at the time, at least, which, as we are also aware, is no defence in itself. But what of Rafael? In your report, Doctor, you record him of sound mind. A bright boy for his age. As fit to plead as his adult brother. Well, yes. But also no. I don't follow. Which one is it? A child's mind isn't fully formed, like an adult's. Different aspects develop at different rates as it continues to grow. Yet you assessed Rafael as fit for trial. He understands his charge? Yes, he understands it. And record him as having no obvious psychiatric or psychotic problems? That is correct. Yes. But, in fact, as a rather articulate, clever child, and fit to plead? Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Nothing further. Dr Keaton, could you please explain to us how a child experiences the world? Well, the child's reading of the world comes from the sensory, emotional part of the brain that reacts to impulse, instinct, aggression, whereas the more rational, decision-making part of the brain, the pre-frontal cortex, that responds to situations with good judgment, isn't fully grown, literally, until we're adults. It also struggles with futures, understanding the long-term consequences of actions. So there's a fundamental imbalance in their capacity for understanding. Could you tell us, then, what might have been going on inside a child's mind the night of such a murder, in response to an imminent threat of violence, experienced before, happening once again? A child's brain aged 12, 13, 14, say, would have been emotionally overwhelmed and compelled to react. Thank you, Doctor. Nothing further. RAY GIGGLES So, after Mr Jameson's acquittal and return to the family home, the collective decision was made that Rafael, along with Serena and Christie, would no longer be deemed to be children in need. Correct? Yes. Yes, that is correct. And why was that, Mrs Delaney? The...the children had their father back. And they seemed much happier. The family appeared much more stable a unit. Much more stable? Thank you. Children in need are defined in law as children aged under 18 who need local authority services to prevent significant or further harm to health or development. Do you recognise this definition to be what constitutes a child in need by your services? Oh, yes. That's it. Yes. To prevent significant or further harm to health or development. Yet, after a terrifying incident Ray had witnessed against his elder brother, its charge upped by this very court to attempted murder, Mr Jameson's return to the household, along with the weapon used in that incident, resulted in Rafael no longer being seen as a child in need. Is this correct, Mrs Delaney? Yes. Nothing further. Yet his record details a vicious, unprovoked attack on a peer. After Mr Jameson's return, yes. "Unprovoked" the records read. So much so that Rafael was suspended. Is this correct also, Mrs Lyndon? Yes. This unprovoked assault only serving as a kind of gym, if you will, like the violent games he played on his computer. Your Honour. Please continue, Mr Ramsden. Nothing further. How was Rafael as a student? He was a pleasure to know. And was the school aware of Rafael's role in the household as carer to both children and mother? Yes, erm, we were. To an extent. And is it not so that Rafael used a special school grant, intended to clothe him, to clothe his half-siblings, the deceased's own biological children? Yes. This is true, yes. And this unprovoked attack at the school. Was it something out of character for Ray, would you say? Yes. Ray was a... He was a gentle and sensitive... I mean he is. He still is. Sorry. Nothing further. Kerry, don't lose your cool, but... ..Nathan isn't giving evidence. Nathan? Nathan. Ray... Nathan, please. Ray, turn around. Nathan. Now. What the hell was that? He needs me. No, no, YOU need you. More than ever. OK, so Nathan's defence aren't showing the jury Nathan's police photos either. But that's their trump card. Why? I don't know. In case it makes him look too disturbed to them? Ray, listen now. I want you to have a life, one day, of your own. And that life very much hangs on what happens next. We feel your best chance now... ..is to give evidence. I can only advise, mind. It's up to you. OK. OK. Right. Ramsden will come right at you. And he will give you nothing. You look him in the eye. You stay calm. And you think carefully before you answer. Do you remember what you told me about just before it happened? That... ..I lost control? Good. Focus on you. Not on Nathan. You are not speaking for him as well. You got that? OK. SCOTT: OK, let me in, Veronica. Fucking let me in! We can talk about it! Come on, just open the door, let me in. Are you listening up there, Nathan? Well, you get ready, boy. Bad, bad rabbit. Just remember what Kerry said to you. Rafael, you are being tried for murder. Do you understand? Yes. I do. And did you have an equal part to your brother in what happened? I had a part in what happened. Yeah. You accept that you killed a man? Yes. I do. Were you scared of this man? Yes. After Scott Jameson was acquitted, did you want revenge? No. But something needed to be done? For the record, please, aloud. Erm... ..I don't know. Was violence ever talked about? No. Never. Nathaniel was spending his life in his room. When he came to your room that night, how did he look? NATHAN MUTTERS Mum said...Mum said...Mum said that we have to..we have to lock our doors cos Scott's... Mum said that Scott's going to... Calm down. He's going to go to the shed and get the axe again. Calm down. Yeah? We have to lock our doors, cos Scott's gone back to the shed, OK? Nathan, calm down. To finish...to finish the job, once and for all. Come on. For the record, please. He said that...he said that Scott threatened Mum. Nothing unusual, by all accounts. And we can only have your word for that, as she isn't giving evidence either. So, did you not think killing Mr Jameson a bit... ..extreme? Erm... ..I don't know. In your room, you and Nathan, did you discuss how to do it? Erm... We just... ..went downstairs and got the knives. Who decided? It wasn't planned. Your brother, in a state, by all accounts... Who was clearest of mind? Your Honour. Leading. So, you went downstairs to find the deceased curled up, fast asleep. Actually, no threat at all. SCOTT BREATHES HEAVILY No, not... Not then. No threat at that moment. But you still stuck the knife in? Who led the charge? Look at me, Rafael, not your brother. We just... We just went and attacked him. Did he just wake up? He had a lot of defensive injuries on his arms. I can't remember. It just... ..happened. A man is stabbed over 70 times. His head near decapitated. And you can't remember? That this butchery, somehow, just happened? Did Scott Jameson die in silence? I can't remember. But you intended to kill him? Rafael McCullin, on that night, the decision was made for Scott Jameson to die. I lost control. When did you lose control? I lost control... ..before and during the attack. Nothing further. BELL TOLLS IN THE DISTANCE BELL TOLLS NEARBY DOOR OPENS Are you all right? Me and my brother, we... ..we murdered. We have only heard from one of the brothers, Rafael. Do not have your sympathies swayed by his age. Ladies and gentlemen, this boy is a cold-blooded murderer. Scott Jameson was butchered... ..as he slept. Rafael McCullin has admitted in that very witness box his part in this savage, diabolical act. This boy here had the capacity. That is clear. And is as responsible as Nathaniel. And, together, they planned then mercilessly murdered a loving, caring father... ..of two young children. These are the only facts for you to consider here. My learned friend wields the word "responsibility". But who took that for Rafael in this room today? His parents? An adult brother who couldn't give evidence? The police? This very court? The services that circled yet ultimately failed to protect him and his family? All are culpable here. Yet we are not here to problem-solve. This arena, this Crown system is designed for a win. Or lose. Guilt or innocence. Beyond reasonable doubt. Binary. Like fight or flight. No room for nuance. No room for an emerging life lived in chaos. And what is loss of control if it isn't that? A boy backed into a corner lashes back with that same terrible, furious rage he so feared himself. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Do you want me to stay in here with you, Ray? Are you OK, Kerry? That's an odd question for you to be asking me right now, Rafael McCullin. Will the accused please stand? Members of the jury, in the matter of Nathaniel McCullin, have you reached a verdict upon which at least nine of you agree? We have. On the charge of murder, how do you find the defendant? Guilty. In the matter of Rafael McCullin, have you reached a verdict upon which at least nine of you agree? We have. On the charge of murder, how do you find the defendant? Not guilty. On the charge of manslaughter by loss of control, how do you find the defendant? Guilty. PEOPLE MURMUR All rise. Nathan. Nathan... ..please. Mum. How's...how's Christie and Serena? No-one will tell me. They're not with me any more. They took my babies away, Ray. Mum, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I did it to protect you and Nathan, I did it to keep you and Nathan safe. OK? OK? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Not much good if we're not all together, Ray. RAY SOBS BUZZER GATE LOCKS BUZZER BUZZER BUZZER DEVICE BEEPS That's good. Now stand up tall, tall, tall, tall.
