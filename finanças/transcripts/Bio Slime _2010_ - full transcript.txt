Come on Baby. We've been here over an hour and I'm really bored. And horny. I told you to wait at Jack's place. This is very important. Fine. Fuck me now or I'll blow your brains out you dirty rat bastard! You bitch! What the fuck are you doing, Donna, that fucking guns loaded! What? Jesus! I know how to use a gun. Jack taught me. Jack's a fucking crackhead. Don't point it at me. Baby, you're way too uptight. You need to just chill. Now, I'll make it up to you. Why don't you put that frustration to good use, alright? Alright. Troy! Listen, Man. There's some people out here you need to meet. Are you fucking serious right now? Bastard. Stay down! Stay quiet! I trust you were successful. I trust that's not a ham sandwich in there. No more jokes. This is what you want. Now, where is what I want? Yeah. Well, about that. It was a lot harder to get than what you made out. Don't try my patience. And test... Generosity. Well, that's the point. I don't think it's generous enough considering... Choose your next words carefully. It's in the trunk. Lucky for you, you found me for this job. Not that I mind a little dirty work. But it was a lot harder than I expected. It fits. What about that? We don't need that. Thanks, Babe. Yeah. Oh, it's you. No, I'm not drunk... Yet. I got a hangover. Yes, because I was trashed last night. Come on. It was my reception. What am I doing? Taking a drink. The only way to get over a hangover you get back to drunk. Hold on a minute. You know what? I'm gonna have to call you back. I gotta see who this is. Hi, Mary. Troy. You shooting today? What else? Just two scenes. Maybe you hear to see me. Sure, Sweetie. Can you get it up? Yeah. Hey, hey, where you going? Uh I just got a couple more boxes. Now, where are you putting all the stuff? Up in my room! Oh, you mean my paint room, you fucking squatter? Come by after I'm done I want to ask you something. Yeah, how do I know when you're done? When I stop screaming. Hi. Shit yeah. I got distracted. I'm listening go ahead. He hit her? You gotta be kidding me. No. Yeah, she... She wants to come over? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Look, I'll take care of her, alright? Yeah. Jack, it's me! Come on let me in! Keep it down. What the fuck. Let me in! Alright. Alright. Hold on a fucking second! What? David's dead. David is dead! The fuck do you mean David's dead! I don't know, I don't know! He killed a cop or something! That stupid bastard! What the hell is he doing? What is that? I do not know! This is what he killed him for. And then the cop killed him after that! Wait a sec. He killed the cop... Yes. And then the cop killed David. Yes! That makes no sense! I don't know! I don't know! All I know is that there's blood all over the car, okay? Where the fuck is the car? Here? You brought the motherfucking car here? What the fuck was I supposed to do? It's 80 miles away. Alright, alright, alright, alright. Calm down. I got a idea. What are you doing? You stay here and I'll be right back. Okay. You know what? On second thought, why don't you come with me. Oh. Yo, what's up? Sit right here. I know, I know, I know, I know. It's cool... Um, you chill out here. I got something. This will calm you down. This is really, this is good stuff right here. Here take this, okay? Hey, Chuck. Can you do me a favor? Can can you keep an eye on her? Man, we're about to shoot the pop shot here in a minute. What's wrong with her? Man, she's freaking out really bad. Can can you just please keep an eye on her? Make sure she doesn't puke on my couch. We're shooting there next. Dude, she's not going to puke. She's not that kind of sick. Thanks, Man. Thanks! Jack. Hey, where are you Skizzler? Who is it? Landlord. Now is not a good time. Don't care. Fuck off! Get the fuck out of my room. This isn't your room. You're two months late on the rent. Hi, Troy. You can't even stand up! What do you want? You're moving out tomorrow. You gave the pornographers until next week! Yeah, they pay their bills on time. What do you do? You live here in your studio. Jeez, what a fucking dump. You're a great piss ass drunk. Masterful! Come on drink up! Give it up! Stick to what you're good at. Drinking and painting houses. Come on Sandy. Let's go. I got a lot of boxes to go through. And this ain't your room. You have till tomorrow to get your crap out. Bye, Troy. Hal. What are you doing here? I'm bringing back your paintings. What? Why? They closed your show down. Because of last night? Troy, I don't think you realize just how bad it got last night. You mean how bad I got? Yeah. The vomit... Remember? Just put them back in the van. I gotta move out tomorrow. Okay. Hey, Hal? Yeah. Thanks for everything. No problem. What the fuck happened to you, Man? I had a revelation. What? The ogre fuck you out? Oh come on. Man he was trying to get my room but I got this shit locked up tighter than this most nut sack. You ever seen his wife? That bitch is hot! I heard she was a mail order bride, but I thought mail order brides were... Hey just shut up for a second. What do you have locked up in that briefcase in my paint room? I don't know what's in the briefcase man. But I think it's gotta be some pretty good shit. Good shit. Don't touch it. Some weird machine it. Okay Sweetie. You're done. Thank you. Go take a shower. Here. What the fuck is up your ass? I quit drinking. No way! You're not kidding, Man. Nope. How long's it been? About two minutes. Come in. What's up, Troy? Oh, should I come back later? No, no, now is good. I got another scene coming up. I might need your help later. Oh, that reminds me, I need your help. What do you need? I need your artistic talents. Oh, yeah? I need my house painted. Thought the house was your husband's. The divorce is final. I'm keeping the house. Okay. Hey, did you say you needed something? Yeah, Shannon's coming over later. I guess her boyfriend's getting a little rough. The fucking bastard! I'll talk to her. Yeah, maybe. Oh, what is this? Headband? No, it's a skirt. Uh, I had to ask, huh? Fuck it! That's bullshit. What do you need my help for? I quit drinking. You're kidding. Why does everybody keep saying that? Just now? Yeah. In about 5 hours, you're going to be in a world of hurt. I can't take it anymore. Just tell me, what did that asshole do to you? We had a fight. No shit. Did he hurt you? Huh? Did he injure you? I'm okay. Come on, let me see. Shannon! Shit! I'll be okay. That son of a bitch is getting smart. You better leave him or I'm going to kill him. I'm going to leave him. Problem is he doesn't want to let me go. This is it. Go through all this shit. See what's what? Throw out all the crap. Why don't you throw it all away? You haven't touched this since we got married. How will I know what is good and what is bad? What do you want to do? Buy one of Troy's paintings. Okay, tell him if he gives you one, he has until the end of the week to get out. Hey, save us a arm. Yes, Dear. Nice. Good stuff! There's some guy at the door, says he wants to talk to someone called Shannon? This is Shannon. Shit, he wants to take me back! What? No way, that's going to happen. Who is it? How did he find me? I never took him here. Well, that asshole followed you when he came before. I guarantee you that the man keeps tabs on his bitches. I'm not his bitch! Listen, why don't we just call the cops? Oh, hell no. Nobody's calling no cops. You guys stay here, leave it to me. I'm really good at this type of thing. I'll go talk to him. No, he's angry, he's probably drunk. No excuse I should know. Hey! You're leaving him, right? Right. How'd you ever hook up with a loser like that anyway? Shannon! Honey! Where are you? Hey, you can't go in there! Oh, looks like I might have to kick this boy's ass. Do you know how big he is? Listen, why don't we just lock the door? Hey, how do you lock this thing? Uh you can't. You can't? No, the landlord snapped the key off in the lock.. Where is she? Is she behind this door? You're hiding her! She's that way. Oh, that fucking traitor! Ugh. Fucking porn stars! Egh. Shannon! What the fuck, Chuck! Chuck, turn the water back on! Come on, I have to get out of here! Jesus! I just want to talk to you. I don't think so! Come on Shannon, let's go home. She's not going anywhere! Yeah. Hey, Everybody! Just take it easy. Oh my God! We're going home! No your not! Mary, go tell them to shut up! What the fuck! We're trying to shoot next door! Oh yeah! What the.. What the fuck? Where the fuck are you now? Come here. Oh more! No! Oh yes! Sorry! Don't apologize! Get the fuck out of here before I cut your fucking head off! Is this thing sharp? Get out! Ow fuck! And don't come back! I still think we should call the cops! Brendan's still high. He'll calm down soon. Oh, stop making excuses for him. Look, I still don't think we need calling cops. What's your problem? What do you got in your room, you tweaker? That's my room! It's just some personal stuff. Like what? Your collection Playboy? I know what you have in there. What the fuck do you have in my paint room? He's cooking up speed! You have a meth lab in my space? Most meth labs are discovered by the fire department. After they blow. I'm bringing my husband. Look, I ain't going to blow anybody up! And everybody just calm down. Hey Chuck, do you need anything else? No, I'm alright. They look good. Alright, I'm going to go out for a smoke. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead. Ready? Pump it all over her back. Okay! Just hurry and come on with it. What's your hurry? This is gross. I want to take a shower. Gross? Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Just came in. Oh. Oh my God. Oh fuck. What the... Oh are you one of our performers? What? Are you one of the performers? I'm the bald bomber. Listen up. I don't give a fuck who you think you are. But you are not gonna fuck this up for me. What the hell is this! Oh my God! Now, be a good little girl and keep quiet! I'm gonna take care of some assholes! No! I sealed up the doors, anyway! No! I'll call the cops! I'll be done by the time they get here! Look, I don't have an escape route here. Why don't you have a window? I'm in the middle of the building. If there's a fire in that hallway. I'm trapped. Troy, you're moving out tomorrow. Yeah but I didn't get fucked tonight. Jack, just keep your door closed. What hell is going on in there? They are shooting porn! What the fuck is this? Get off of me! Your boyfriend will be back. Let's call the cops. This won't happen on my phone. Why not? I don't have signal! I always have a signal. What's going on here? Quiet. You hear that? That's not fucking. What the... What happened to you? She's a crazy bitch! Get her! In the hall! Get her down! Grab her legs! Hold her! No, no no no! I'm Trying! She's having a seisure! Almost got her! Okay guys what is that? It's moving! What the hell! Ah fuck it! What the hell is that? Don't just stand there! Get it! Kill it! No, behind you! Kill it! What? Shit! Alright, everybody stay behind me. I'm sure us guys can handle what's ever out there! No, right? No, no, no. No, no, no, there's more! Thers more! Just a piece of it! A piece of what? Listen. We've got to go! Buckle up! Come on! Great job so far! Here, I've got something! Think you can handle that tough guy? Come on! Get out of my way! Alright, not so fast! It's right in front of me! Help me. Brendan! Oh, hey Shannon. Can you help me out? Alright, everybody back. I said, can you help me out? Back to the studio! Hey Man! It's not locking! Help me, die motherfuckers! What the... Shit! My toolbox! My leg! Give me a hammer! I have a hammer! My toolbox, over there! I got it! Hal open the box! Come on! What the..! Mary! The lighter! Close the fucking door! Coming through! It's working. It's working. Must be the strength. Still working. Come on! Come on! Alright go ahead! Alright. Hopefully that'll hold. What the hell is that? What the fucking hell is that? You were covered in that shit! You saw it! What happened to Chuck and the others? The're dead! Swallowed them! Hey, Guys. I've been shot here! Swallowed? Like that asshole? Shh! Be quiet. Man it grazed you. I've seen a flea bite, bigger. Hey guys, quiet. I don't hear it anymore. What do you want to go out there? I ain't going out there! Fuck that! Fine, stay! My husband! Where is my husband? Who? He's the landlord. Jimmy, where is he? Hey, he could get help! There's spaces in the basement. Oh, we have to get out! No shit but our phones don't work! How does that happen? Do I look like the phone company? Do you have a landline? Yeah. It's the 21st century. We have to get someone's attention. I don't think you guys understand. We're it! The building is deserted! Everyone just calm down! Listen, no one can hear us up here. Wait a second! What? I think it's listening to us. What's listening to us? You're right. Okay, Everyone. Now, calm down. Get away from the walls. That thing came from the briefcase, didn't it? I don't... What briefcase? Jack, tell us about the briefcase! I don't know anything about the briefcase! Tell the truth before I break you in half. You fucking opened it! Where did it come from? Donna brought it here. She said it was Dave's. Where's Dave? I don't know. They were doing some deal. He was trying to sell it to a cop! Troy, what was inside? I don't know. Some kind of computer. What else? They had a canister and a key and a lock. Troy, what did you do? Did you? Yes, I turned the key! And something came out of it. Did it look like that pile of snot that just tried to kill us? Yeah, it did. How could you do that? Why did you turn the key and not tell us? I thought I was hallucination, alright? I thought I had alcohol poisoning. I shut it with the thing inside of it. What? Donna must have opened it again. How do you know? She left the room. I told you to fucking watch her! Fuck off! So what happened to Donna? If she opened it, she's dead. Just like the others. Whatever the hell that thing is, we gotta find a way out of here. Well, whatever the hell that thing is, it has us trapped. Hold on. I say, we make a run for it. Not all of us will make it. But I'll take my chances. By betting against the rest of us. Just improving my odds. I'm betting on myself. We don't know anything about that thing! Jack's right. Come on, we can't run a gauntlet. What are we going to do? Well, we're not going to sacrifice each other. Is that ventilation system off? It was turned off yesterday. Why do you ask? I need another can. It's definitely in the walls. It's in the air ducts. I guarantee those ducts are full of rusty holes. You think that thing can surround us? It's slime. It's all over. No, it's not over. I meant it's all over the place, Dickhead. Maybe we should should cover up the hole in the wall. Hey, Troy. Give me a flashlight. Oh, man. Coming through. What is it? It's a crawl space. It's pretty big. It's like a it's like a shaft. Shaft? Well, maybe it was a chimney. Oh, it must be where the dumb waiter was. Dumb waiter? It was here once. It was removed in the 40s. Maybe we can all fit out through there. I do not know. You're probably going to have through a wall when you get to the bottom. How about going up? What's up? It's the attic. Is there roof access? I think so. I don't know. It's been so long. Only one small enough to go up there is... Mary. Ha, I ain't going up there. Well just a moment ago you're willing to charge on out of here. With everyone else. Yeah using us as your cover. We're going camping. You gotta have someone to push at the bear. Oh well thoughtful of you. Look I'll go. You sure? I'm a little bustier than Mary, but Eat me. I think I can fit. Okay. Okay. Here's the plan. See if there's roof access and if there is, just flag somebody down. Okay. And tell em we're here. Okay. Sure. It's dark but it's not that far. I can see the pulleys at the top. Hey, are you sure that these ducts aren't connected to the shaft? I don't think so. They should be separate parts of the building. Sure you want to do this? No. Make sure it doesn't come through the bottom. She's been up there for a while. So what? How do we know what happened to her? We don't. If she gets out, she's not coming back. We just have to wait for help. Yeah, but if that thing gets her, she ain't coming back either. Now I feel like shit for letting her go. Hey. Sorry I keep busting your balls. Just my way. Okay, I'm sorry you're such a bitch. I'm not sorry. But I'm curious. You seem like a pretty tough chick. Yeah. Why were you with that asshole. How could you let him treat you that way? It's not that simple. I didn't really notice. You didn't notice? No, I didn't notice. It started off slow. There'd always be an excuse. I thought I was helping him. From the look of it, he was helping himself. You were probably his fucking slave. Like I said, It's not that simple. You don't understand. Oh, I do understand. I was just like you a long time ago. Before I learned about life. What did you learn about life? No one's going to save you. No Knight in Shining Armor. Life is about kicking ass and getting what's yours. She's been up there for a long time. Maybe she got through. Maybe we should reinforce the hole. Not a bad idea. Grab the hammer. Annie. Hey. Are you alright? What did you see? It's no good. There's no way out. There's got to be. Are you sure? The creature's there. What? In the attic? Yeah. It's all over the place. I closed the hatch behind me. I went real slow and real quiet. I heard, did it hurt you? Did it touch you? I don't think so. Are there any wounds? We have to look, okay, Annie? Okay. Come on, let's patch this up. It was huge. How huge? It covered most of the floor and it lit up from the inside. Lit up? Bioluminescence. What? Bioluminescence. It can chemically produce light. Maybe it's electrical. Or both. Uh electro... Bio... What? I don't understand. That's probably why we can't use our cellphones. That's great. Fucking great. Will the ceiling hold? That ceiling is not the floor of the attic. There's about three feet between them. What about those water stains? What about them? Is it water tight? Will it hold back that thing? You know, I hate to admit it but she's right. Those water stains they've been there forever. Nice. What the fuck? Fucking rat! Ewww. What the fuck. Jimmy! Jimmy! If we wait, someone will come. If we wait, that thing's going to come in here. Shut up! Someone's got to be coming. End up like my husband! There's just no way to warn them. What else can we do? I don't want to just wait. I'm gonna go crazy! If we're waiting, we're going to get really hungry and I'm already starving. Troy, do you have anything to eat around here? Sure. Annie, are you okay? I don't feel good. I don't have much of a appetite. No shit whackers really doesn't do it for me. Want some vitamins? I need protein. I don't think we have any meat. I disagree. How about it big boy? How about what? Alright, you can eat me first. Oh, come on! Are you that much of a slut? I am a professional! You are unbelievable! What? No TV, no radio! I can't believe we're just waiting here! Might as well have sex! You're sick. I don't do girls and I already had Jack. You slept with Jack? Hey, don't act all surprised! I didn't sleep with him, I fucked him. Yeah and just about everyone else. Yeah just about everyone. Well... You know what? I think I'm going to sit this one out. How come you never asked me? Because I like you. I'm raining an endorsements for a 2-bit whore. You're a mail-order bride. At least I'm honest about what I do. That is different! Right. Where the hell are you from anyway? Fuck you! Eat me! Hey. Hey. How long has it been since you had a drink? No one told you? I quit drinking. Turning a new leaf. Maybe now is not the time to detox. Without medical attention, it could really hurt you. Afraid I don't have much of a choice. Do you have any alcohol? Broke every goddamn bottle. Shit. Man, I hope whoever finds us doesn't start painting this shit on the walls. They'll be in for a hell of a surprise if they do. Yeah color of it looks like brown. Well, I got piss and shit here for the accents. Anyone need to go? You know, Pierre Manzonei canned his shit and sold it.. Who? Pierre Manzonei. He's an artist. That's bullshit. No, he called it "Artist's Shit 1961". Sold it for the same price as gold. You can have this shit for free. I'm not sure we can really afford to wait. Why not? Well, some food, little bit of water. Detoxing from alcohol can kill you. That thing out there can kill us. Well, we have to do something. Troy, might die. Whoa whoa you know, calm down. Maybe we can't. When I open that briefcase, there was two switches. One said, live. The one you turned. Right. Okay, the other one said kill. Look, I think we should get the briefcase. It may be a bomb. Maybe not? Might be poison or something else we can use to get out of here. Do you want to take that chance and use this as guinea pigs? Hell yeah! The only problem is that that briefcase is in the other room and I'm pretty sure the creatures in there too. Look, that creature didn't kill me the first time I touched it. Yeah. How come? I was drunk. Pickled in boose. I don't think it liked how I tasted. You mean it doesn't like alcohol. Well, you ain't drunk now? Not yet. No, that's denatured alcohol, wood alcohol. So what? So what? It'll kill him. Yeah, well not before I get in there and get the case. No, it's too much for us. Let him go if he wants. At least the rest of us are going to have a chance. Yeah, he let that thing out in the first place. Yeah, that was his plan all along. No, we can't put this all on him. Look he's volunteering. So what is your problem? My problem is the way that he's doing it. Could threaten his life. The briefcase could save ours! You don't look so high either. I don't feel good. Let me see your mouth. No. Come on. Stick out your tongue. Leave me alone! Sorry. What the hell are you doing Troy? Stay still Troy! Why did you do it? Calm down, don't hurt yourself. She's dead! You killed her! You stupid fuck! Leave him alone! He just killed Annie! He didn't mean to! I do not care! I don't want to end up with a crushed skull! How do I know I'm safe? It could have been me! It's taken care of! Let it go! He's a stupid paranoid drunk! I said let it go! Don't come on strong with me! I'm not the one to fuck with! Get used to it. Oh and the little pussy girl's getting a backbone huh? Okay! You Bitch! I'm learning. Excuse me guys. Where's the body? What do you mean? Where where's the freaking body? It's just her clothes. What are you guys talking about? Hi Guys. It's me. You just had a big bloody gash on your head and now it's gone. Is that better? Fuck no. Get off me! Get off me! Get that thing off me! Get it off me! Get that thing off me! Oh shit! Double bag it! Give me another bag! The lid! Get me the lid! Grab me the lid! Give me the tape! The tape! Here! Look, Guys. I appreciate what you've been through. Really I do. But I'd like to not spend the rest of the night duct taped on this fucking bed! Where is Mary? Oh, no! She went down the hole! Mary, Mary come back! Fuck you! Mary, get back up here! No one will save us! No Knight in Shining Armor! Close the hole! We have to close up the hole! Hal, don't do it! Awe shit! Eat me! How did you know? Was it a guess? There were no marks on her. I saw her check out her tongue. I bet it went into her mouth. Because she seemed so normal. Maybe she didn't know she was a creature. I keep thinking about that. I'm just glad you nailed her before she came and got us. Relax, Troy. You did the right thing. Does Annie think that? You know what? It took a while for that thing to change Annie. So what? Now's our chance to get the briefcase and see what the kill button does. But what if it kills us all? I don't think so. Well, I'll tell you, I'm not going out there by the time we get that door open, the thing's going to come in here and kill us. I don't want to take that chance, do you guys? Yes, that creature just killed Mary it has to rest. No, we don't have to open that door. The case is in the next room right through this wall. I'll go. You can barely move. Come on Jack, get the couch! Get ready to board up the hole. I'mma get that case! Okay, when I get back. The signal, right? What's the password? Be yelling and screaming. Let me the fuck in is the password. Right. Hey guys let me through. Let me in! Come on. Look, let me in, let me in, it's me, not the password. Did it touch you? No, but Annie was right though. It's slow but it's blocking the way out. Where am I? You are inside of us. Who are you? I do not know my original name. Only that I am very old. What are you? I am a collection. I am all who I have absorbed. You killed them. No, they live inside with me. Please, let me go. Let you go. You are a creature who seeks pleasure above all else. I can make you feel things. Sensations you can't yet imagine. I want you to join me willingly. What isn't it for me? Let me show you. With mere thought, I can produce a chemical that you hunger for, that you desire. Beyond all beasts. I can make you feel warmth. I can make you see light. With us. You will taste sweet. Hear music. Smell the scent of lust. We can make you feel sensational, more intense than you can possibly feel with your body. Yes. You stop shaking. Well, he's an artist. Very practice of being intoxicated. Nothing to brag about. Relax, okay? Look, I know you had a couple of hits. Look, there's no way that I'm going through this sober. Hal, you look tired you know you did good getting this case why don't you just go relax. Okay. Alright. Mind if I join you? Go ahead. What are you looking at? The water stains. What do you see? When Leonardo Da Vinci needed inspiration, he would just turn to his surroundings. Things like cracks on the walls, smudges. Stains would become clouds or mountains. He would make the most amazing landscapes out of stained walls. Wow. Where'd you learn that? Troy. So what do you like his apprentice? I'm a student. He's my mentor. He's a great artist, a great teacher. So what's the catch? What do you mean? Why is he down and out? Oh right. That's too bad. Yeah. It is too bad. No, twist it there. Jack! What? Go take a break. Are you sure? Yep. Okay, now is the time. Time for what? To go! We're not ready yet. Listen, waiting is no longer an option. You said it was blocking the way. I think I can fight it. What about Troy and Castanza? I'm willing to go. I want to go. Okay, listen. I'll take the lead. Follow me. This is an EMP device. Electromagnetic pulse. Right. So you know it won't hurt you, okay? All you have to do is push this button. Use it as a last resort. Troy you're not shaking anymore. No. Throw it up. It'll kill you. I'm not going to vomit. I'm too good at drunk for that. You'll die. Imma distract that thing, okay? You have to leave now. Just... Save Hal and Castanza. You don't have to sacrifice yourself. I been dead a long time, alright? I need to do this. This way you all live. I made a promise to your mother three years ago. I need you to make one to me now. Okay. You have to go. You have to go now. All of you, go! Leave! I want you all to leave! I just need 2 minutes! And I want you out this door! Okay. It's been 2 minutes. Troy, I see you started drinking again. It taste terrible! I'll get used to it. Then you'll join us. Mary, you look like shit. I don't think so. I think you still love me. I want you. Well, you're all wet. Join us. Who is us? All of us. All of the beings ever absorbed. You think they die? But that is not the case. I integrate all your faults, your feelings, your memory, into a body that is vast eternal. We are all together. We live. I do not think so! I don't think you are, Mary. I am every bit of her and more. You wanted to sleep with me once. Now is your chance to get closer than you can imagine. Like having sex with you? Remember, Mary liked me! Hurry! Alright. Get behind me! Get behind me! Stay down! Watch your side! Oh shit! It's stuck shut! The other door. I thought it was locked!
