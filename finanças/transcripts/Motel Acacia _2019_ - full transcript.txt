My mother told me a story once. About a creature my father met. With a hunger for men and lust for women. What lived in the trees now lives within. You better be thankful you weren't arrested, boy. It's only been less than a year and it's the second time now you've almost been caught. They knew my black ID was fake. But I was careful, sir, I promise. And they didn't see my face. You can't show weakness, boy. You won't survive out here if you do. Things will be different when we get to the motel. Don't expect the same comforts you had in the city. They don't even make these at home anymore. Mama used to smoke this when I was a kid. It was hers. Long time ago, isn't it? I'm sorry, it's too cold. Bring the supplies. This will make you untouchable. Well, almost. It wasn't easy getting you here, boy. And it sure as fuck wasn't cheap either. But you have my blood in your brown veins. That's the only reason you're here. Hey! I've been waiting here forever, man. You've got to feed me. I'll eat anything. - Come on, you said that... - I said what? Isn't this place meant for immigrants? Do you see any around? - That woman, Angeli... - Not me. ...she said that this all comes with my documents. Hot food and bed, too. I think that woman's mouth tends to run, doesn't it? Food's not going to be hot, and I get to pick where you sleep. You're free to walk back to that cabin. In this weather? Are you fucking kidding? I'm all paid up, man, with extras! Hey! You'll see there's a system in place here, boy. It strikes a very delicate balance. One thing out of order... and it all slips into chaos! Can I trust you, boy? I'm your son, sir. Yes, but children disappoint their parents all the time. I need proof. How? Our friend's clothes are filthy. Tell him to get rid of them. You want him to strip? What I want is to get rid of his clothes and all traces of him being here. Yes, but you can do that inside the motel. No, I don't want him dragging his grime inside. What will he wear? Sorry? What will he wear? Is this difficult for you, boy? Are you shy? Why are we doing this, sir? Why are you doing this, sir? Or are you not ready to take charge? It should be easy for you though. He's one of your kind. Hey... uh, are you Filipino? What's your name? Dee, Dee Hernandez. Dee. Listen, okay? I know this might sound a little... But I need you to listen. And I need your cooperation. Remove all your clothes before going to your room. You crazy? No fucking way! I knew it! God damn fucking perverts. Dee! You still hungry? Look! Do it and this is yours. I've already paid for that! I've already paid for that, motherfucker! Dee, please. Do me a favor. Do me a favor. Help me get this over with. Stop begging, J.C.. Take your fucking clothes off, man, or leave! I'll leave then! Just give me back my fucking money. Cold doesn't scare me. If the cold doesn't get you, the border patrol will. They're everywhere. Trust me. We need to help each other. You want me to undress, huh? Here. All your money's there. We're not thieves. Stop standing around, boys. About what Angeli said... - Food and a bed right? - Yeah. And about that? Bed's down here. The rest we can take care of in the morning. Uh, I was thinking, if you could just lend me some warm clothes. I'll pay for it. And you can keep the rest of the money. You know, it's suicide, man, if you go outside this time of night. No, no, no, no, decide in the morning. And if you want to cancel the deal and leave tomorrow, I'll throw in a new set of clothes for free. But really, I'd rather leave tonight if that's still okay with you. This is your room. It's not necessary, sir. Now listen very carefully. I didn't want to bring you here. In that fucking cabin, you asked to come. You insisted on coming. No, you pleaded. You begged to come. And now you want to leave? Fair enough. Leave. Go! But go as you are. Freeze to death, or get shot. Everything you need is inside. So... why are you here? - To take over. - Take over what? This. I know it's not legal. But it ain't exactly illegal either. You know... when I first left my country... it was to go to yours. And I did things. I made choices. choices I could never take back. And this moment reminds me of one of those choices. Choices? You can trust me, sir. Oh, by the way... I'll tell you if I trust you, not the other way around. Who built all this? Does it matter? Look. That's what we do. Just look, boy. Clean this up. What? Take over. Start by cleaning this up. Oh, and if it calls out, just ignore it. Oh, don't worry, J.C.. Don't worry, boy. It just likes fucking with people. Oh, what's happening? You clean this up as well. But don't use water! We have chemicals at the back for this place. Shh, shh, shh. Okay, are you okay? Are you okay? Then one more thing. Whatever you do, no matter what, never bring a woman into this room. Ever. Samuel. What did you promise mama? I told you no TV during school days. I don't like it when you misbehave. Is Doctor Carl there? Son, give the phone to him. Doctor Carl, can you hear me? The signal is terrible out here. Doctor? I've double checked with the bank. It was deposited the other day. Can we schedule Samuel's operation? Huh? Hello? Doctor? Doctor? Hello? Just get it done! Hello? Fuck. Miss? Miss, you can't be here. You have to leave. Apologies. Angeli? My papers are in order. - Who are you? - J.C.. Are you lost? Me? Lost? You're trespassing. Please leave. Do you work here? My father and I own it. But we're closed now. You fucking kidding? The old man has a Filipino son? I thought there was no cellphone signal. Now you know the spot! Does he pay you? Who? Your asshole father. He always pays late. I suppose you know about the town council? I guess not. Hey! - Hey. - What are you doing here? - I said tonight. - Yeah, I... can we talk? Talk fast. - I need an advance. - You get paid after delivery. I know, but... it's an emergency. You'll get paid tonight, after delivery. I know, but I'm already good for three tonight. - It's good as delivered. - No, it's not. - And the deal was four. - Yeah... but the fourth one got picked up by someone else. Now what if that someone else was me? I'm not paying you to do your job for you, Angeli. Okay, look, look, look, that was my mistake. I didn't know he was going to go for the border on his own. I just need some money wired before the banks close. I'm sorry I have to ask you, and I never asked before. I just really, really need the money. Please. Oh. Wait. This is, this is half. What are you waiting for? Get in the car! Where are you going? Get in the other way, son. This is it. This is the moment I've been waiting for. He called me son. His blood. But what happened after, I can't explain. - Hello? - Hello? Hello, we need help here! Help! Someone! You've been out for a day. Sorry about that. You needed warmth. Thank you. J.C., the three men are here. One of them might be a little difficult. What happens next? First, you pay me the other half your father owes. I don't have your money. Stop playing games, J.C.. All the money's with Father. Where is he? I don't want to be a part of this. J.C., I need the money. My son needs it. Do what you must with the three men but I need to be paid. I've done my part, right? Right? They need to leave. If you tell the three men to leave, the Town Council will find out. They'll come here and pick you up. Both of us will be in trouble if you let the three go. I'm not a killer. Aha! You're alive! That's a relief. A dead host would be bad news for all of us. Especially you. I'm alive enough. - You are? - I'm Don. The accountant. Let me introduce you to the others. That is Bront, the musician. And that is Sami, the insurance agent. What are you talking about? Well, former accountant to be exact. The new law made us all former somethings, right? Just put that in our new Black ID card. The one we bought from you? Black IDs, of course! Right. J.C., you must thank this lady here, you know? She saved your life. We had this idea to put you in a hot bath to get you warmed up, but she said no because... Because you would have gone into shock, and that would have killed you. Or I will, if you don't give us what we've paid for. So listen, J.C.... Is there any chance we could get something to eat? Really? This is it? My father went out for more supplies. We just got separated during the storm. So you think your father's still alive? Because she said that you said he was hurt real bad. Yeah, he's okay! Our cars just got separated during the storm. You know, can't see anything out there. As you know, J.C., it's very difficult for us to get into this country. I still remember that smell of the boat, that small boat packed with 50 people, children, fathers, mothers. We were floating around for two months. There's this one guy, always complaining about the heat, about that damn smell. He once even said, "I'd rather die than continue." One night, there was a storm, hit us hard. Many of us ended up in the water, including him. Many of them made it back to the boat, but not him. I saw him in the water... trying to swim at first, but gave up at the end. J.C., I don't want to be that guy who stops swimming. That's why we prepare. We sacrificed everything we've earned in this country for your father's services. And this is what we get? I don't think this is enough. Don, usually my father... Don, he'll be back soon with food, with your documents. - Just, just relax. - Oh, will he? Because he told me, we need to get out to get the food. I'm a little confused now here. - Are we going to get the food? - Don, you'll get what you paid for. Does anything else matter? You tell me. I also remember paying for beds. Look at us, sleeping on floors and tables. Where are the rooms in this place? Every room down that floor and hall is locked. I've already checked. Yeah, about that, there is just some problems below. Only a few rooms are working, but, yeah, I will take care of that. Hey, buddy, we're going to need one of those rooms. - Please, J.C.? - Yeah, you two are my guests. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. What about us? A snowstorm this bad, there was no way for me to leave. Where would I go anyway? Angeli's right. These men will die. What do I do? What would Father do if he were here in my place? Father. Don't slow down, son. Don't slow down. The storm's getting in early and strong. We can't be stranded out here. Last night. Yeah? What about last night? - A man got torn to pieces. - Don't slow down, don't slow! Something killed him. No. You killed him. But I was with you the whole time. - You killed someone. - So did you. That's not true. Don't you pity him, son. He would've ripped you to pieces to get across the border. Now listen very closely. Don't slow down, son! Don't slow down, I tell you. You only exist if you're useful to people in charge. This whole immigration issue they keep on talking about day after day, well, it's not my problem, until someone pays me to make it my problem, understand? You and me, boy, you and me, we provide them this service. Take this. Yes, I know, you need to be cruel in this world if you want to survive. - Take it. - No, I don't want this. - Take it! - No, I don't want to be a part of this! You're fucking, fucking, fucking ungrateful! Don't you understand what I'm offering you? Someone might control this land, the gates, the borders. But in that motel, I'm God! I am God! Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir, are you okay, sir? Stop, James, stop! Stop! Please, please. Don't go. I won't do anything. I won't hurt anyone. I won't kill anyone. All I need is to buy a little time. Time. Are you sure we should do this? Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you, my guy can make anything work. We just need to get that card to him before he leaves town. Once we change that ID to yours... you're a ghost. No one will bother you. But we're so close to getting across. Can't we just stick to the plan? The plan? - How is any of this the plan? - What do you mean? - You made me stop the car. - That's not fair. We both agreed he would have died if we left him there. Okay, but you know that I can't cross the border. That card is a chance for us... This is not enough to bribe the patrol guards for the three of us. You told us that the papers will come through, papers and ID cards. We have none of those. Yes, I understand. But the fucker who runs this place is missing. We're so close, man. Our children are waiting for us. You know, we appreciate what you've done for us, getting us this far. But maybe it's different with you, because... Because? What? You guys have families and I don't? So I'm not as motivated to get out? Please understand him, Don. You know why we've all are tried to get across. But that lady, Angeli, she knows something. What if J.C.'s telling the truth? All we know is what Angeli told us, and they took our money. She could have been lying since the very beginning. I don't believe either of them, but we have to be patient. Angeli! Angeli! Angeli! What are you doing here? Open the door, J.C.. - Open it. - I can't. - I said open it. - Be quiet. If you don't, I'll tell the others you've been hoarding food. That's not true. Do you think they'll believe you? I'll say you've been playing them this whole time. You'll have to open this to prove to them you're not lying. But if you show me what's inside... we won't have any problems. Open the door. If you close it, I'll shout. There's no food here. What are you looking for? The money you owe me. Money my father owes you. Your father's not here. So it's now your debt. Stop arguing. - Cathy, where are you going? - That's it! - That's the sound I've been hearing! - Wait a second! Guys, you're not allowed in here. Why? What about her? Nothing. There's nothing valuable here. That's right. Your room's next door, let's go! What is it with you and these rooms? Look around, man, there's no one here. - Cathy, stop! - Hey! Hey! Don't touch her! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This room needs... this room is infested. - Infested, with what, bugs? - Yes, yeah, yes. - I don't see any bugs around here. - No, no, no, Cathy! - Cathy, don't... - Hey! What are you doing? - No, you don't understand. - Understand what? We saved your fucking life. Least you can do is get us some food. No, no, wait! It's gone. - What's gone? - The sound's gone. What do you mean? All I needed to tame the beast... was to become my father. Then I wasn't afraid. Mother was right. I am my father's son. I can do this. I will make it out alive. We're leaving! We want our money back. Leaving? Where do you plan to go? We'd rather take our chances with immigration than starve to death here. Look, guys, my father is almost back. Just wait a little longer. No one's a prisoner. We leave now! The refund. Look, Don, I don't have your money. You don't have the money? Where do you keep it? The motel safe? No key again, right? We take the whole safe! Give us our money back! Hey, hey, calm down! If they leave, the town council will come after us. It's on us. Not on me. It's on you and Father. Hey, a little respect for your guests, please. Hey, Sami, Don! Cathy! You see that? - It moved! - Shh. It hurts so much. The water makes it a little better. Cathy? Cathy, you need to get out of the pool now. Come here. What do you mean? We have everything we need. Except James, where is he? Cathy. Come here. We need to get you to a doctor. Come here. - J.C.! - Come here! - We need to get this out! - Come here! Get her! Oh my god. Don't let it kill me! Get it out! - Get it out! - Careful! Careful! Get it out of me! Get it out of me! Get it out! Lay her down! Lay her down here! Shit, What the hell's inside her? Get it out! Get it out! What are you doing? It's killing her. She's just in labor. - No, no, okay. - No! - Hold her, hold her hand! - Get it out! - J.C.! - Get it out, cut it out! Cut it out! - Cut it out! - I can't do it! Give it to me! No, no, no, no! Kill it, J.C.! Kill it, J.C.! Kill it! Oh my God. You okay? - Get him up! - Let's get him out of here. What's going on? J.C., what happened? Hey. We got to let the storm pass. It's impossible to drive. - You won't be able to see anything. - Hey! Stop that. Bront needs help. We have to try. Hey, J.C.! - What's going on? - This door has been opened recently. Maybe it was James. Do you have Cathy's key? Okay, let's go. Who did this? I don't know. Ah! Jesus, are you trying to stop us from leaving? This house is welded shut! Angeli set us up! - It's her! - Check on her car! No, no, no, no, no! She wouldn't do this. There's no food. There's no money. There's no fucking signal! Is there anywhere with signal? It's an hour away! I know what you did. You slashed Cathy's tires. - What are you talking about? - So you're now the most important person here. I've been in here the whole time. Angeli, I just want to make sure that nobody leaves behind with that thing! You're not touching my car! - I know where your papers are. - Where? It's in the locked room below with all our money. - She's lying! - We all just want to leave here with what we were promised, J.C.. Are you betraying me? So make him open that door, and I will drive us all out of here. Sami, keep an eye on Bront and the girl. Let's go. Protect her? She fucking gave birth to a monster! I meant protect Bront from her! Can you hear it? Hear what? That sound. I can't hear anything. What is it? Shut up! Are you okay? Hey. What the hell was that? Sami? It's here. James, you in there? It's jammed. - Let's kick it, then. - No, wait. Hey, stop your lies and open it. Open the door, J.C.. Don! Bront! Sami. - Are you okay? - Cathy, what happened? I don't... I don't know. I... I woke up... I don't know. Where is Sami? Sami! You took your time. Angeli? She knows something. She's responsible. Goodbye, my... my brother. Sami... What are you doing, Angeli? It's innocent. Why isn't it attacking you? It's innocent, J.C.. It killed two people. Come on, just throw the fucking thing in! J.C.? Angeli. Listen to me. We need to help each other. What you're holding is dangerous. I don't want you to get hurt. I can feel its pain. It's just afraid. It didn't mean to kill them. Angeli. You need to throw it in, otherwise... It'll attack us too. I can't. - Do it. - I can't. Do it! Do it! J.C., please don't! I don't want to die here. Bront and Sami, they never hurt you! Now, give me the keys! I just... I... I can't do that. - Where are the keys? - I just can't do that! No, no, no, don't! Give me the keys! - J.C., please. - Stop, please, please! Don, what are you doing? This is her choice. Don, it was me. It was me. The town council pays me for every immigrant killed. Angeli knew nothing about this. Stop! Don, Don, I can get you the food! I don't care about the food! Or about the papers! I don't care about the money! Just give... Are you ready to leave now, Don? J.C.! Angeli! Lock the door! Hey, open the door! Open the door! The beast is on my side. I am in control. Calm down, Don, please? Open the door. Don, I need you to relax. We can make it out in one piece. Whatever that thing is, I think we should just stay clear of the green moss. Moss? You're fucked up! You, your father... Angeli, you're all fucked up! Don, I'm trying to help you. If you want to get out of here, listen to me. Put the knife down and follow the video. I'm not your toy! Don, I need proof that we can trust you. You can't come along if you don't listen to orders. You're welcome to stay here and starve... or be eaten. It was for us, for emergency, just in case. So you've been watching us the whole time? No, of course not. Did you do something to James? What? What are you talking about? You know, Cathy, I saw footprints outside. I think he left to get help. - You were there. - To help you. - I remember, you were there! - Cathy, you've lost a lot of blood. - How did I wake up in that other room? - It's okay. - You've been through a lot. - Where's James? - Where is he? - J.C.! We have to be quiet. - For how long? - We wait it out here. We have food, he doesn't. We can survive. What if he goes out and slashes my tires? Stranding himself here? He's not that stupid. I'm not taking that risk! Where are the girls? Don, relax. We have the car keys. We can head out together. "Together." Your monster killed two of my friends. You're afraid of me now? It's not my monster. Don, just put the knife down. We can go to the car. - We can get help. - Just stop it, J.C.! You already confessed... that you're getting paid to feed us to that thing. Don, even if you try to get across the border... who exactly are you trying to get to? You've got no family... ...no kids. You won't be able to get food in town. The people, the cops... everyone's part of it. There's really nowhere for us to go. That's it? Do you want to kill me? Or do you want to fuck me? Stop it, J.C.! Stop it! Don... Don, I'm so sorry. Angeli and I... we didn't have a choice. The guy who was always complaining about the heat... about the smell. The guy who stopped swimming... he was my father. The battery's too cold. - What should we do? - Wait until it gets warmer. Aren't you coming in? It's cold. I need to call my son. Cathy? Cathy, we got to get ready to leave. This place is mine. You're living in my place. Do you understand? You are mine. I am your master. Angeli? He's gone. Angeli, get away from the bed. My Samuel is gone. Angeli? We'll go to Samuel. The two of us. There are things you can't control. Creatures you can't tame. Monsters you have to destroy. Angeli? After fighting so hard to get out of that place, now I wish we'd never left. My Samuel is gone. Everything we went through was for nothing. Give me the knife. Give me the knife. Angeli stop moving! - Give me the knife now! - Don't do this, J.C.! Give me the knife! No, give me that! Cathy! Angeli! Angeli! Wait! Angeli! Angeli! Angeli, where are you? Angeli? Angeli! Angeli? Angeli, we need to get that out! We must get it out before it kills you! I'm just trying to help you! Stay away! That day... walking to the fire. I felt what it felt. I felt its pain. I felt what it felt. But that's what you wanted, right? You and your father. That I will become like the both of you. But this, don't do this. We're not in the motel anymore, J.C.. We are free. We are free. Angeli? Forgive me. She's gone. The beast has her too. I hope... I hope she found her way home. A great fear washes over me. I am alone.
