I pick...I pick...I pick... ...Vanyo. Vanyo! We're waiting for you! I'm not playing, we're taking the car out. Stop bragging about that car! Oh yeah, 'cos you don't have one! We have an Opel and you don't hear me bragging. But it's second hand! It's still more valuable than a Wartburg! Leave him, we'll start over. Knight Without Armor. Hey, kid, what's your name? Vanyo Stanov. Like Stano the soccer player? No, dad's head of the ministry! No way, the entire ministry? Well, not all of it, but... And we have a car! It's awesome! It goes through all sorts of overcomings. All sorts of what? Overcomings of course! You know? Ah, I know. Well, have a nice drive! Bye! See? It's scratched. Damn shame. It's fine. Fine! Yeah right! You don't know left from right... Don't sweat it, boss, it's tiny. Bit of polish, it'll come right off. You should've turned left a bit more and reversed, wouldn't have scraped it. Normally I take it out fine, but... You got a charm for it too, that's the way! You got a good colour. They had ones that were even better, Deluxe, but they ran out of them under our noses. What's better about them? They have trim. Well they were better, admit it! See, women! If we'd got one of the others, this one would've been better. Bozhilov, if you don't mind. You know how to... Vanyo! Quick, over here. Attention! Done. Have a safe trip! Now who's chasing you, why are you speeding? Who's speeding, no one's speeding! Right, Vanyo? For your information, the Wartburg can make 140 km/h. You keep quiet. It said 40 on the sign. And I'm driving how fast? 60. Not 60, 50. We're within the allowance. We're within the allowance. Daddy, you'll let me drive later too, right? Wait, wait a second...let's try the wipers. Good! Daddy, you know I met a driver. What driver? Don't distract your father. His name's Manol. He was stopped at a red light, and I said "Hello". And then he said "Hello". Then I asked what his name was, and he said Manol. And I said, "Let me shake your hand, Manol!" And he said "I can't reach" because he was in a truck. And then the light turned green and he left. And that's it. What happened? Testing the braking system. How is it? World-class! Is that why you stopped like that? Big deal! Hey, we have a radio too. Get the antenna out. And listen, if anyone bends it, I'll rip your ears out. Why mine? Because. Solid state's something, isn't it? You flick it on, it plays right away. Look at this guy, look what he's doing. What an ass! Are there no laws for you, eh? Who gave you a driver's licence? This is the life, what else could you want? Boza. You can have boza later, when we get there. Always later. When are you going to let me drive? On the way back. Stoyan, wait! No suggestions please. Close one. What's the rush, buddy? Damn tourists... Enough, enough. Uncle Georgi! Uncle Georgi! That was uncle Georgi on the bus! You're hallucinating. It was him! Can we catch up to them, dad, he's promised to take me to a soccer game. Soccer games now. Are you crazy? We're out because of you, now you want us to go back. Yeah right, because of me. Come on, dad! You see? I told you we should've left him at home. Only trouble. You see? Dad, look at the dial for the water. Whoa, did you top it up? Why us? I told you, didn't I? You know what can happen now? If the bearings melt, we'll have to scrap it. If you're out to ruin my mood, I'd rather have stayed home. Oh, see, I forgot to open the grates. Everything's alright. But we'll have to stop and top it up. When can I hold the wheel, dad? Come on, get in, quick. Emilia? You didn't recognize me. Vanya, is that you? It's me, hi! Hey, we forgot each other, it's been so long. Penka Hristova came by for New Year's, we didn't sleep all night. We looked through photos from our college days. We were so funny! I thought we talked about getting together, but we've scattered all over. Stefka Mircheva is a PhD candidate now, remember her, she wasn't even that clever. And Radka...you don't remember her? The one who used to go out with Krum. Of course I remember. Radka's in South America, her husband's in the export office in Chile, she sent me a postcard. Where are you these days? Nowhere, at home. Penka said your husband was high up in the ministry. Well, not that high. Come now, don't be modest. Mine's a forest ranger. Honk honk! Mom, watch me drive. Now we signal... Who moved my mirror? You again? It wasn't me. Then who? I might've moved it by accident. Sure, sure. I know who's to blame. Just a bit longer, and we're there. Any suggestions for the agenda? Emilia Stanova has the floor. I want boza. Enough with this boza! Give him some, might shut him up. Hold this. You see, you pig? You see what we did because of you? Here's your boza! You donkey! And you, why aren't you more careful? How are we going to get the new upholstery cleaned? Dad, let me do it, come on. Get out of here. Vagabond. Watch this, we'll swallow this guy whole. You said you wouldn't. Get him, dad, swallow him! That's not a car, it's a Trabant. The promise doesn't apply. Plastic. You know this joke: A Trabant ran into an Easter egg, and the egg said: "Where'd they hide you?" Why hide? Because, since you don't get it. I don't get it, eh? Well can you guess what this is? What? Come on now, later. Watch this, watch what's going to happen. When we are sufficiently close to the motor vehicle... Honk the horn! No suggestions, I said! See, we passed that lunchbox! Lunchbox, lunchbox! That's just great. Why's he stopping you? How should I know? What's the problem, comrade? Papers for the car, please. And your driver's licence. Everything's in order. We'll see if it's in order. And now, comrade, can you tell me what violation you committed? Heh, are you posing me riddles? I haven't done anything. Nothing, eh? Who overtook that Trabant over there? Me, so? You tell me. What does the driver have to do while passing? Honk, but I did. Yeah, you honked, but what else does he have to do? Signal. Ah, so you do know. I think I signalled. You think, but you didn't. Can't drive cars with thinking. Now signal left. Right. Good. They're working, as you can see. That's the problem, that they're working and you don't use them. What's going to happen to you now, eh? Stoyan, what's going to happen when we write you up? Bad things are going to happen. Bad things, right. Since you've decided to spoil people's Sunday. Oh, sure, we're spoiling your Sunday, for not obeying the law. But why are you going to write him up just for signalling? How many crashes happen for less, eh? You stay out of it when I'm talking to the driver. Leave him, let him write. Look, you made the child cry too. You keep the child out of it. I'm not crying. Alright, get out of here, but keep in mind we cancel licences for not signalling. Got it. That was close, avoided the fine. Well done, Vanyo! Good thing you started crying, otherwise... if you know what I mean. Turn on the radio. That's it, something for the soul. Now the nature starts. Dad, we don't have any birdies for badminton. They're there, keep looking. Here's good. I'm going to bring the car over. Come on, let's go. Just a minute. We forgot the cucumbers. Stoyan, the child! Daddy? Daddy, the car fell in the ditch. So today you got a whole year's worth of hugs and kisses. It's because they thought I was in the car. Well of course, why else? And the car's not worse for wear, right? Well, a bit. What an accordeon. Not looking so good, but no worries. Hey, get lost. Shut up you comma. Who's a comma? Hey dad! What's the matter? Nothing, comrade, nothing. I'll show you nothing. Don't be angry, dad, they didn't write you up. Bring me the other set of pliers. It's quite early, comrade Stanov. You just left, now you're back. That's it, being motorized. What happened, boss? How'd this happen? Well this truck was reversing... We forgot the parking brake and the car BAM! right into a tree. Go play. Go! It happens, how's the engine? And now you have no car. But dad said we're going to buff it out, throw a coat of paint on and it'll be good as new. Well, your dad... What about my dad? It wasn't his fault. Of course not. I had something else in mind. What else? I'm thinking all these Wartburgs, Moskviches, Volgas are a good thing. But are they what we fought for, eh? What do you think? Isn't there something more valuable, something better? Mercedes 220S. My thoughts exactly. And what are you going to do now with your friends all away? I can play by myself. That's no good. M-A-D-A-M. Madam. Hey, frontwards and backwards, madam is madam. O-I...That's not Bulgarian. Uncle Georgi! Yes, this is Vanyo. Pardon? One minute. Feel that. Pudding. What pudding, that's what I call muscle. Hello, Robin Hood! I'm not Robin Hood! Who are you? D'Artagnan! You look more like Don Quixote to me. Well I'm him too! Dad and I are reading about him. And when we duel, I always win! He says I'm ready for feats of daring. What sorts of feats? Defending the weak, fighting evil, and so on... you've read the book. Of course I've read it. Hey! Careful! It's a great book. Only the illustrations are all... but I glued them shut. Why? They're wonderful. Yeah, but in them he always gets defeated and beat up and... ...and so on. And who are you waiting for now? Emil. Embo, about time! Mom said I should eat my breakfast. You've been eating for a whole hour. Password! "From near or from afar" "Defend the knighthood star!" Password accepted. Where's Slav? You can't whistle! Slav! Maybe he's not allowed. Why are you late? My aunt's arrived. "From near or from afar" From Pazardjik. No, the password. "Defend the knighthood star!" Password accepted. "We are three merry brothers Paris is our home If you want to mess with us We'll crack you on the dome" At your feet! At your face! Cross! Duel! You're dead! I'm not! And you're supposed to be my second! I'm not a second! I'm Scaramouche! Halt! Timeout. Can you tie my armour, it's come loose. I'm telling you, Scaramouche duels better than Robin Hood. He fakes you out, and then when he sticks his sword into the table it goes BRRRRR. Can you imagine, a movie with all three - Robin Hood, Wilhelm Tell and Scaramouche! Yeah, and they're all on horseback! It would be great if we had a horse too. Where is it going to graze? There's tons of grass over there. Where's it going to live? In our garage, we'll take the car out. And then we can ride it, all three of us. Watch out! You mind your own business. My friend Sancho, who's approaching in that cloud of dust? My mom's back from the grocery store! Traitor. Let's go. Is that you whistling? It's me. What are you doing? Studying. School's out, isn't it? I'm studying English. "Good morning!" "Good morning!" "You are a frog." I don't know what "frog" means. Frog! Well then you're a "frog". Where were you last night? How did you know? I saw you leaving with your folks. I saw you too, why did you hide? Because. Did you write that? What? That. "ROSAMUND" No. Come on out. I can't. Mom! Look! He's hitting me! Let's go. Go pick on someone your own size. Look at you. Hey, kid, get rid of that cardboard. You're all packaged up. What do you want? Hooligans! I'm going to tell Mom. Mom! Look at them! They're beating Vanyo up! Mom! Mom, look! Beg for mercy! Never. Ms. Kirilova! Vanyo! What are you doing? Forshame. I'll get them... I know them, they're in homeroom 5-B. They started it and now they're hiding. They ruined our house. I wanted to help him but I tripped. Who started it? I did. Why? 'Cause. Isn't that great. I was just on my way to your place. Is your dad home? Yeah. We'll see who's at fault. It wasn't him. We'll see. Why'd she rat me out? They were bothering those girls! We'll see who was bothering whom. Now Ms. Kirilova will tell your father everything. Tell him what? We're not even in school. Give me your hand. And the other one. Have you seen those papers? No, I haven't seen them. I haven't touched them, dad. No, not those. Look in the bedroom. Here they are. I found them. Did you read it? I skimmed it. Well? Well, from your point of view, perhaps you're right. Why only from my point of view and why perhaps? A long-serving Sofia teacher is suddenly assigned to a remote village, for no reason. Hm, for no reason. What's the matter, Vanyo? I'm looking for my textbook. Hurry up. No reason, you say. Well they probably say otherwise. There's been an inquiry. There's been no inquiry! What do you mean? That's exactly what I want, an inquiry. Even if no inquiry's been made, there are reports, facts. What facts, what facts? This is all slander, by a colleague of mine who says "nucular" and "Shakespeare's Faust". The main thing is, I criticized the headmaster. And a place had to be found for a certain relative of his. Well, comrade Kirilova, you yourself just proved that there is truth to these accusations. You're saying we at the ministry do nothing but dole out cushy spots to our relatives. That's not what I meant... You didn't, but that's what it sounds like. And, you will agree, we can't be bothered with every little thing. Little thing? I empathise, believe me. But put yourself in our shoes. Finally, may I give you a friendly piece of advice? Instead of wasting your time and energy with inquiries and arguments, why don't you take your place, your new place, and roll up your sleeves, prove to them what a wonderful pedagogue you are? Your new colleagues will like you, all this will be forgotten, and I'm certain you'll come to thank me one day. So, let the scoundrels triumph. You know, you're very stubborn. You talk as if... How should I talk? What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to... Come on, out. You're leaving already? Yes. I thought you were one of those people who... but it seems I was wrong. Forgive me. Here you are getting offended, and offending others. I told you, that's the way it is, things are complicated. Let's have lunch. What happened? What could happen? You got me mixed up in this. She's his teacher. Teacher! So you're not going to do anything! What can I do? The other one is Dulgerov's niece. You forgot the vinegar again. She's in the right. I know she's in the right. Doesn't mean I'm going to go picking fights. Enough playing Don Quixote. Thanks. That's better. Where'd he go? Vanyo. Vanyo! He got beat up again. You're letting him run amok. I don't know who's letting him. All these suits of armor you're making. They ripped the last one. Vanyo! Big deal! It's not too badly ripped. Don't cry over such little things. We're knights, aren't we? Come on, we'll fix it right up. That's quite the badge you've got on it. Where'd you get it? Give it! Wait, Vanyo. Why are you upset with me? Look, a bit of tape and it'll be even better than before! I don't want it, give it to me! Vanyo, listen! Wait! Come on, the soup's getting cold. What happened? Hm, what happened. He's asking for it. Come on, leave him alone. Why'd you do that? Because. I'm not playing "Knights" anymore. Was that a game? I thought you were a real knight. He's not either! Who? You know. Why didn't he help her when she asked? Well, he was prevented by some overcomings. Prevented! You know how good Ms. Kirilova is? I know, of course I know. But if I were you, I wouldn't throw down my weapon. What'll the others say, eh? What others? The other two. From Paris. Look. Hey! Get out of here! They're not yours! If they're yours, why did you throw them out? Get out of here! Don't you spit at me, or I'll come up there. Slav! Embo! Help! Vanyo! He gave me his word of a knight that he'd let me ride his bike. Your mom told you not to let anyone ride your bike, right? But they're teaching me. Just make sure they don't break it, otherwise who knows what your parents would do to you. What'd she say? She said not to lend my bike out. But you promised me before she told you. Ok, but only you. Why only him? Remember I let you play with that hedgehog? Alright, I'll let everyone have a turn, but just one lap. Mitko first. Pinocchio and I are second and third! He's from another neighbourhood, don't let him ride it. As if I wanted to. Bet you don't even know how to ride. Tell them. His dad does yoga, he did all sorts of crazy tricks at camp. He can hold his breath for 2 minutes. Show them, Pinocchio. Look what you've done. That's how it was. Ya right. Now you'll buy me a new one. The chain's broken. I forgot to feed the hedgehog! I'm coming too. Can't fix it. I'll just nip by my house, and I'll be back. If you want I can take you to my neighbourhood to get it fixed. What about money? Ah, he's a friend of mine. Is it far? Not too far, towards downtown. Alright, but let me leave the bike. What does your dad do with yoga? Everything. But he's best at the lotus. What's the lotus? I'll show you. You sit, and you cross your legs. It's tricky, I'm wearing pants. I can do yoga too. You know how my dad does it? But he's ill right now. Ill? I thought he did yoga. He was cursed and got a kidney infection. What book is that? "Timbuktu". Can I borrow it when you're done? No, Embo asked first. Okay, but after Embo? Alright, alright. Have you read "The Hound of the Baskervilles"? No. What HAVE you read? It's really something! Is it new, or does it still have the old letters? I don't know, my uncle told me about it. There's a female spy hanging around my street. What spy? A spy! But we're tailing her. How'd you know she's a spy? She's got all the signs. Look. IL-18. It's awesome! I've taken one of those all the way to Varna. Can't even feel it moving. Wait till a storm comes on. I never throw up, for your information. Watch this. It's hot. Not that hot. It's so flat! Sometimes they come out all bent, like a lockpick. Then they can open any lock, even cars. No way! Word of honour! Want to try it? Better not, something could happen. What time is it? Around four. Hang on, I'll ask. Hey! Excuse me... Call me tonight! No problem, Kolyo! Excuse me... That one keeps spinning. Let's go. Here we are. Wait here. Two minutes and it's done. Uncle Pesho, can you fix this chain? Get out of here. Please, uncle Pesho. I told you, get lost. What happened? He's really busy. We'll go to the other one. I thought he was your friend. The other one's an even better friend. Excuse me, comrade, what time is it? Four thirty. Give me back my chain, I'm going home. Hang on, this guy'll get it fixed. Where is he? Right there, by the woman with the lettuce. And what if he doesn't want to either? Course he will, you know how many times he's pumped up my soccer ball for free? Who's your team? Levski of course! Levski! Let me shake your hand! Come here! She's there. Who? The spy. Are you sure? Well Misha... Let me tell it. By the time you tell it... I saw her, I'll tell it! I went to get yogurt and I saw her. When she saw me she started sniffing around the mailboxes. Is she the same one? Of course, I know her. They must pay her in dollars! Hold on to the chain, and you two stay here. You idiot! Get in there. Are you afraid? No way! I've had my tonsils out. Look! Big deal. I've eaten poisonous mushrooms. When they took me to the hospital they got this big tube and AARRRRR all the way to my stomach. What are you doing bragging about tonsils? Tonsils hurt more. Krasi! O man! Forgot the yogurt! Come here. What are we going to do when she comes out? We'll follow her and we'll tell the police. Who's she visiting? Who knows. What if she has a gun? By the time she takes it out of her bag... What if she has grenades? Grenades! Not afraid, are you? No. I've eaten poisonous mushrooms. She's coming! She's coming! Get down, she'll see you! What are you doing here? Who sent you? I...I...my chain broke. Why have you come all the way here? Who are these boys? They think that... And you believe them? They say that...you're not one, are you? What? A spy. What, what? A spy. Silly boy. My mom is not a spy! Liars! Liars! Vanyo! Your mother's a spy! Your mothers are spies! Vanyo, leave them. Let's go. Mom? Yeah? Who were you visiting in that building? An acquaintance, who else? Here. I'll come by again tomorrow. Who is this boy? What's his name? Pinocchio. Is this the same acquaintance that made your dress for Balchik? No, another one. Which one? You don't know her. Mom, uncle said he'd give me the harpoon and snorkel but only if I learned to dive. But I can too dive, watch. Good, good. Later. What about the chain? Your father will fix it. Listen, don't tell him where you've been - he'll be very upset. What if dad asks? If he asks, tell him you were in the park. You're not going to tell on me? I won't. Really? Really. Hey, time for debriefing. What came out of this one? She just went to the seamstress, and you... What are you still thinking about? I'm not telling. Well then I'm not going to speak to you either. Why did she promise she wouldn't tell on me? So you don't get spanked, that's why. You're sneaking something past me again... Come now. Is that any way to talk to adults? Alright, alright, stop ringing. Hey mom, if you only knew what a great movie I saw, just don't get spooked. So the ghost... What did you say? Spooked. What is this word. I don't want to hear you using it ever again. Shoes! Dad? Yes, in here. Dad, we saw the best movie ever. Where'd you get the money, eh? Oh, I had some. It was about these ghosts, and... Listen. First they were invisible, but then one of them made this blue potion and put in lots of blue dye and they all became very blue... Alright, alright, tell me later. Later. Come in! Comrade Djambazov, where's Vasko? He's not here, went to his aunt's. When will he be back? Tonight. I wanted to tell him about this movie... Excuse me, have you seen... Does it hurt? Embo! Where'd you run off to? Come on, your uncle Georgi's on the phone for you. Hurray! Uncle Georgi! Uncle Georgi, is that you? Where've you been all this time? Today? Okay. Bye! Uncle Georgi! Bengal tiger! Let me look at you. They've got you all dressed up, like a French dandy! Is it yours? It's mine. New? Eh, once-new. Are your parents upstairs? Mom's at the beauty salon over there. She said to come see her. Alright, go tell her we'll be back at eight. Uncle, can't we be back at nine? Come on, go, run. Run, run, run, run! Mom? Mom? Over here. Come here. Did your uncle come? He came, and he said we'll be back at nine. Not nine, be back at eight. But... no buts. Now go, make sure you don't get dirty. What'd your mom say? Not to get dirty. Okay. Get on. Where are we going? To the cinema. We're seeing "The ghosts of..." What was it, I can't remember. "Spezen castle" You've seen it? No matter, it's really interesting! We'll watch it again? Alright. But we still have time until then. What are we going to do, eh? I have one suggestion. Done. What about the other one? Same thing, I told you - one suggestion. Why are you stopping? Thinking about something. What are you thinking about? Cup or cone? Cone of course! Alright, cone it is. An ice cream cone for this little spider. And you? I'll have this. Thanks. How is it? Excellent. Let's sit down while you're eating. Listen, I have a very important mission for you. I have one cigarette left, but it's for tomorrow. No matter how I beg, plead or threaten, don't let me have it. Understood? Understood. Good. You and I haven't had a man to man talk in a long time. Well you haven't been around. I told you, I was away on business. Are you going to stay here now? Nearby, in Kremikovci. Permanently? Not quite. You know we're wandering knights. Now you tell me, how's school going? We're done now. Sad, but I think we'll get over it. What about the violin? Listen, you can't put your feet on the bench. If I can't... Have you seen where they make the newspapers? No. You'll see. I have a little assignment. If they don't let us in, we'll tell them we're leaving for... Where are we leaving for? We're not leaving, we'll just tell them we are. Got it? Excuse me, please. I got it, but dad says that lying is bad. Your dad never lies, that's why. We lie a little now and then, you know, in the interest fo business. The important thing is that this is true. My ears get red when I lie. Then wear your hat really low. They write without visiting the sites. I'll make licorice out of them. You know what licorice is? No. Now you'll see. The spacing's good here. Don't forget the title. Comrade Hristova? Yes? One moment. Sixteen words, and the question mark. Got it? Let's hear it, comrade. Let's hear you. At the "Riskova" construction site there's information that you're preparing an article. They'd like to know whether you've checked your facts, and how you've checked them since you haven't been to the site. I have. Twice. Well? Listen, did comrade Filchev send you? It's not important who sent me... It is! You're not the first. Every other day I get people like you insisting I take this out, I take that out. Why don't you deal with it on the site instead of pressuring us? You threaten. Wait, who's threatening? I'm not waiting, you've got brigades waiting, machines waiting. General comments now. General comments? A MK-1's been waiting three days for elements to be delivered. That's 120 leva per day! Is that true? It may be true, but... May be. Is it true that on 28th and 29th of last month three brigades sat idle for lack of steel? Is it true that the seven buses of the company have to ferry over 1500 workers 30 km? Have you ever been on one, or do you just drive past? Have you been on one? No. I couldn't. I missed three buses. Really? And listen. Have you over there got no conscience? What sorts of people are you? Do you know what they call what you're doing? The article's right there, it's been ready for two weeks. And it will go to print. It is the truth and it will be printed! Understand me? Understood. Comrade, why are you laughing? You're putting punctuation on my coat. Oh. Sorry. Also, I've rather warmed to you. Right, Vanyo? Yeah. Thanks for the compliment. Goodbye, comrade Hristova. Goodbye. Goodbye, comrade Hristova. Let's go. Excuse me, comrade. What is your name? Uncle Georgi! That's it. And pretend we never had this conversation. Look, they put balls on the railing to prevent the journalists from sliding down! Uncle? Eh? What's licorice? Licorice is what they just made your uncle into. And you, what about you? What about me? What? You were no help. How could I have? Hey, give it. Give what? Give me that cigarette. But didn't you say... Forget what I said. You going to give it to me? No. Things got trickier, tricker and much, much worse. Alexi! What? Where's Alexi! Here! You call that light violet? Let's go again. Now, when I'm popping my balloons, can I say "pop-pop-pop"? No, you can't. Just pop them. Things got tricker, trickier and much, much worse. And everyone was pulling for themselves. We must protect the king's crown, lest the whole world fall apart! And my dividends! And my evening brandy! And my fancy outfits! The cards are showing four jacks on four distant battlefields. Hold! Hold! Hold! What is that child doing there? I can't work like this! I cannot work like this. I can't work like this. What is this child? How come there's a child appearing on my stage while I'm rehearsing? Marinov, I demand an explanation. Comrade director... No! I demand an explanation! Alright, here's an explanation. He's with me. Georgi! What are you doing here? Fixing your revolve. Really? Is it going to work? It will, it will, of course. Where'd you run off to, it's been years since we've seen each other. You've turned grey. And you've gone bald. You remember the parties, eh? Don't remind me, so long ago. Your son? No, nephew. Well done. So cute. Georgi, swing by, we'll chat, eh? Of course. Forgive me, brother, my head's on fire... I know, I know, art... Places please! Uncle? Hm? What was he? That was a director. Why does he yell so much? That's his job. But he's not a bad man. Yeah, right. Listen, don't you start worrying about the problems of the theatre. There's plenty of others to do that. I'm not worried. You haven't seen masks like that though, have you? Of course I have! Where? In the beauty salon. I don't know about that, men are not allowed in there. But they let me in. Well, with you it's different. These are all one-way streets, we'll have to go around and around... Let's walk. We'll be late. We won't, we have time. What about the moped? The watch is vigilant! What if they fall asleep? Come on, let's go. Hey, you know how long I've been looking for this book? Excuse me, comrade, do you have "The Green Galaxy"? No, kiddo. How much is it? Two-fifty. Did you get any copies of "Kismet"? We sold out long ago. Now what? I only have one fifty on me. Nothing here...nothing here... Do you have any? Comrade, can't you set it aside for me? I can't, comrade, it's my last copy. Is it in high demand? It'll be gone by tonight. Darn, I needed that book. Oh well, let's go. See, nothing. Just the movie tickets. What if we sold them? Oh, right. You're looking forward to the movie. Well, that's that. I won't get that book. Uncle? Let's sell them. Sell what? The tickets. I've seen the movie, I can tell you about it. Oh! Look! I had some all along. Look where I've shoved it. Look, there's the main ghost, and the other ghosts. And that's the countess. And she's not afraid at all. Who's that? That's the main ghost again, only after she's made the potion and drank it. She put lots of blue dye in it and she turned blue all over. Then she dropped the vial, and it spilled and glowed everywhere. And then she made another potion, to turn them all white. And who's that? That's the prince. That too. He goes to Spezen castle, and says to the countess "Machki, machki!" Why "Machki"? I think that's how they say "girls" in their language. And she grabs him and starts spinning him around. And then a tall ghost comes in, spins him really hard and throws him on the ground. And then she steals his valuables, then returns them, then steals them again. Get back in line! We'll call the police! Enough with this police. Hold this a minute. Where are you going? Be right back. You're cruisin' for a bruisin', eh? What, why? Get out of here! What right do you have? I'll show you in a minute. Let's go in, we're late. Here's our chariot. Now, home. I don't want to. Got it, except get on faster, we're late. I don't want to. Look, you have to sleep, no? You might be going on a day trip tomorrow. We won't, the car's not ready. Well, what do you want? I want to sleep at your place, you promised! Another time, you can't now. Tomorrow is Builder's Day and I'm going to celebrate tonight. I'll come too. It's not appropriate. Listen, we're not children, so let's sort this out like men. If you keep pulling these tricks they won't let you come next time. And I won't want you either. So let's go, otherwise no more friendship. If we're friends why don't you want me to come? What will they say about me? I can't even win an argument with a child? Such a man, 73 kilos, with a university degree and a slip-jointed thumb. What thumb? This thumb. Now what, are you going to sleep there? Maybe I will. Enough nonsense. I'm going to count to three. One. Two. Two and a half. Three... Sixty-nine... Sixty-five. What's that? What? O, that's from my flu shot. No, that. Doesn't that prick at you? No. Doesn't weigh heavy on your conscience? No, why? Because you lifted it from me, that's why. Well, you weren't wearing it anyway. Come on, let's put the pajamas on. Just your size. You're quite the ghost. If your mother was here to see you... Let's fix your sleeves. That's it. Uncle? Yeah. You know what this is? No. It's half of this. Me: 1, you: 0! What about me: five fingers, eh? Come on, let's get those shorts off. You turn around. Why? I'm bashful. What about? Well... Well go on. I won't be your friend! Alright, get a move on. I am the Bengal tiger! I will devour you! There's no Bengal tiger, only a Black panther! Well, well. Come on, come on. Wait, wait, wait. You're punching below the diaphragm, that's not fair. I can't reach any higher. Ding! End of round one. So you're chicken. I am. Liar, you're not afraid! What about the landlady! Shoes off. It'll be a bit cosy, but... No, not at all. And no kicking! And no snoring! What's going on? I come from the land of ghosts! Alright, alright, ghost boy, bedtime. Good night. Good night. Hang on. What's wrong, uncle? We forgot the present! What present? It's so shiny! You like it? Is it for me, uncle? Of course! That's pyrite. What? Let's put it away, you can play with it tomorrow. Can I please keep it with me? Alright. You could've brought him back last night. Why'd he have to sleep at your place? Good day. Good day. Because. You don't understand these things. Well, goodbye. Come in for a cup of coffee? I can't, I'm in a rush. Madam, please accept my sincerest regards for you and your husband. You haven't changed a bit. That's me. Georgi! Goodbye and, sorry I can't... No problem, no problem... Hey, sir knight! Goodbye. Goodbye. When will you visit again? I'll visit, I'll visit. I'll call you. I'll go see him off. Get inside. Enough seeing each other off. Shoes off quickly, and come let me wash you, you're filthy. Mom, I forgot to tell uncle something important! Uncle Georgi! Uncle Georgi! When will you visit again, uncle? Soon, soon, I told you. Your word? My word. Mom's honour, dad's honour? And uncle's honour on top. Goodbye, uncle! Vanyo, is that yours, who gave it to you? My uncle. Let me hold it, come on. You'll drop it, look at it from there. I won't. Let me touch it too, I let you play with my hedgehog. You and your hedgehog! Awesome! Let's crush it up and stick it on our armor. You know how valuable this is? Uncle said you can make a radio out of it. What kind of radio? A self-playing radio with no wall plug. Like a portable radio? Not quite, something more special. It's in uncle's book. It's this thick and has all the types of crystals. And it says that stalactites hang from above and stalagmites grow from below. And they have this crystal, asbestos, that they use in firefighter's clothes so they don't burn. Did you see when the tailor shop caught fire? And then the guy with the huge eyes, made out of, not nylon, some kind of glass and a mask with a big trunk. That's not a trunk, that's an oxygen tube. Alright then. And then the firefighter leapt in and grabbed the machine. And his clothes didn't burn. But the tailor's clothes caught fire and he was left in his underwear. Hey, stalactite! Leave the firefighters, tell me about the knights. Who are you now, D'Artagnan or Scaramouche? I don't know. I haven't decided. And what if we picked you a new name? Say, the Knight of the Shining Crystal? It's good, right? Yeah. Well, good luck. Bye. Bye.
