[MUSIC] And then learned, happy? Since it was an unforgettable trip, when do we do another one? You are the only skipper I have known who suffers from the sea. You threw up the whole trip and now you want to take another little trip? -A moment of... -A moment? Luckily we did a good catch. Oh, most illustrious Gaetano, good morning. What did you get? Eh, I got cold. You know, I only do sport fishing. If I catch something, I throw it back in the water. - Look how wonderful, Gaeta '. - Go, how wonderful. But did you know that it is forbidden to fish this type of tuna? What kind of tuna is it? A walking tuna? There are rules to follow. This tuna is too small. But are you coming to measure the fish to me? - Throw it back into the water. -I reject this in water, but when I'm at my house and the water is boiling. But don't talk nonsense and don't play the fool. But let's be calm. But you moderate the language. -The pulcinell has arrived ''. -Pulcinell '? -Iamme bell'ie, iamme bell'ie... -Let's close it here! -Yes, let's close it here, go. -You are a troglodyte and a polenta. -But fuck off, go! -Ah? And then go away 'l cül! He knows the languages ​​... Then 'a soreta! I have not! And then 'to mammeta! This she shouldn't have said. Ah, he was offended, mo. What a customer you found. -And mo? -I meter of fishes... ii Napoli is stronger than Inter and Milan!

Because? today too. - But I'm serious, Ilenia. - What am I fooling around? - No? Wait wait. How is it possible? - First? - Mayor. What is this publication? And this is his daughter getting married. First... First point: I can read. Second point: cancel everything. No, mayor, but I can't, because your daughter is a grown woman. And, like all adult women, they never answer the phone. But how come I didn't know anything? But you are her father. I thought you knew. It should be forbidden to marry before the age of 30. It doesn't last. Do we know all about this boy? Does he have a criminal record? He's married? Did you check well? - Yeah, I checked. But what happened? What are you doing? Are you blowing your nose with the Italian flag? - Excuse me. - What happened? It is that her daughter left me after 2 years, because she wanted to be alone and then she goes to marry someone she met a month ago? It happens to everyone sooner or later... - No, but... But then someone named Loperfido must necessarily be an asshole. Loperfido, of course. The surname is always indicative of a person's character. What is this? It's pummarola. Dotto ', she is my wife: she always makes me a schiscetta with macaroni. You know how many schiscette I had to eat to become who I am? - Too many! Who spoke? They just called you fat, dad. I exclude it. It seems impossible to me. - Go change. Immediately! - Go! Come on! Guys, let's not joke, eh... This is a serious company. We build skyscrapers that envy us all over the world. Boston! New York! Philadelphia! Liege-Baston-Liege! Paris-Rubaix! Milan-Sanremo! Let's not joke! We don't build mud huts in Africa. Sorry, it was nothing personal. And who cares! I am from Saronno. Saronno? I always go to buy macaroons, bravo. Well done. - Break the lines! Everyone to work, come on. On! Dad, you are too good to your employees. If you continue like this, sooner or later they will be in charge of you, you will see. I know how to move. It is a matter of sensitivity, balance... The carrot and the stick... But I like you so badass. One day when I quit everything, you... - I'll take your place. - No. Your brother will take my place, you can be his worthy assistant. - Still with this story, dad? - How many times do I have to tell you that the yard is not a place for women? Not good for you. It is a trench. It is a "jungle". I say this for your own good. I mean, are you happy that your daughter is getting married? But I don't understand, but how come everyone knew this news except me? Eh, indeed! Ask yourself two questions. What are you doing? You have to go. I have to work. Come on, I've got to do. It is a visit between relatives. We are relatives. Not anymore. Your cousin and I got divorced. Listen Gaeta ', come on, you have to help me. I need the money for Gioia, come on. Another girlfriend. And who is this missionary? Joy, my boat. If I don't find the money by Monday, they'll take it away from me. - Those of the banks? - If, maybe... Leave it alone, go, But why don't you take this boat away? Gaeta ', I have always wanted to go around the world with my boat and now I was almost done. I had planned to be out for at least 2 years. This is a beautiful dream. Eh, I know, around the world... No, you disappear from my life for 2 years. But even more. Mayor... What's wrong with this here? That's it, my mom. She got me in the flag. Eh, calm down, come on... Still with this building permit? Holy shit put '... There is this entrepreneur from the north who wants to build a luxury hotel in the Macchia Grande. The former mayor had given the authorization and I don't know how to block it. - It's perfect. You sign it and oblige it to hire me. Never, never. I never will. This northern firm will never have my concession. Not even if we became relatives. Shred, go "! Wait, don't tear up, maybe change your mind. Keep it in the drawer... Your son is getting married. Congratulations. - My son who? - Like your son who? Riccardo. His girlfriend announced it on social media. And am I always the last to know things? Yes. Besides, you haven't talked to each other for months. -And who is she? Sh e-she You are an influencer. Ah, you are a doctor. Good. But no, dad. He puts on some clothes, takes pictures and posts them. - On the phone? - Mh. - And they pay you? - Yes a lot. Well, luckily, right? - Guess where they get married? - Where is it? - In Gaeta. - In Gaeta? Never heard. Where is she? This is where we bought that land to build the hotel and then they never gave us permission. Look, but... does your mom already know that she's getting married? Not yet. Ah, you will see how happy she will be... You will see. Did you see how happy she is, huh? -Is she from Gaeta? - [Together] Yes. Is she at least a good girl? And what work do you do? - The fashion blogger. - And what is it? She is an influencer, right? She'd be someone who... for money... she dresses people over the phone. Don't drink that is bad for you. Go that stuff. I am happy. I like weddings. Do you know I've been doing the Zone Diet for a year? I know a sketch. I want to put in the shot. But our daughter is only 20, do you understand? How old are you... But shawl, right? But how do you speak? I'm just a realist. She can't marry a guy she's only known for a month. - Oh, no? And what have we done? - And in fact you saw how it ended. Except that all the stories are unique and are different... - Mayor. - Excuse me a moment. - There's the hygiene inspector. - And make it wait. Ready? How long must this moment last? - Sorry, he's a guy who... - Mayor! I'll call you. I told you: make him wait? What guardian are you? - Come on! Go fast. Power! - Oh, and what's this confidence? Mayor, I'm tired. I am fed up. You have to calm down with these checks. Oh? Every day the police call me about something. But I am alone! Well? Do we want to neglect the health security of our citizens? But the season is over. Half of the businesses are closed. The other half made it shut 'her! - And what can I do? She did seal grandma's bar. It is a historic bar. A historic bar that, historically, made homemade sandwiches that are forbidden. They should prohibit 'de fa' magna 'those in the envelope, not the homemade ones. Why are these here... - Uè, uè !, - These here, these here... They taste like chipboard and styrofoam. And they have the corner without mayonnaise. So now I'm going on vacation. They are not there for anyone! Do not look for me for any reason in the world! - But who is looking for you? - I have no where to look. But not even if there was an invasion of treacherous crickets! Of whom? Traitor crickets? That I know'? I know those who jump from one chair to another. What is a political allusion, perhaps? Try the sandwich. Feel how good it is. Say hello to grandma! Oh no, thing. No! You have to put the cups in their own way. He knows? Would she be the bride? The shape... The shape. With the initials of the newlyweds. You know the newlyweds? Those who swear eternal love, her in the white dress and him looking like a penguin? Huh? - Hello You have done a very serious thing! Very serious! Realizes? She sent me Pompeian red roses, late empire, when I asked for robin egg periwinkle lilies! Did you understand? Ready? Ready? I love ', everything is fine here. Everything is going well, it seems to me. The place is a bomb... Ah, but then you can't understand '. I hired a wedding planner with cons. But if it's bullshit, I'll take it down in a second on the blog, huh! What the fuck! Come on, love. Holy shit! You say a word for every two swear words. Fuck! Oh well, sorry, I love ', And I'm hysterical. I miss you. Listen, but are we sure we took the right path here? Uncle, flash news! Think that navigators invented and he thinks they even put them in cell phones. I mean a really football champagne stuff, huh! But go fuck yourself, come on. But why don't you laugh? What have you got? I just have the feeling that I have forgotten something. The kitchen? Because you got the wardrobe. Now you laugh, that if you don't laugh you don't likean it. Oh well, but don't tag me. What language do you speak? But how long does this trip last? You never get there. Eh, indeed. Why didn't we take the helicopter like all normal people? Because it's more elegant to keep a low profile. Because I didn't want to embarrass our poor relatives. What do you know that they are poor? - Mom, of course... - Do you see where we are or not? Here we are very, very, very far south. Between the fourteenth and fifteenth parallel. No, well. You understand, Marisa has made the fifth. No, it's our "Sisology" chat. Anyone who gets her boobs back must put the photo on. - It is a comparison group then. - Good. And instead she thinks that there is a friend of mine who has the stink chat. Meaning what? That is, if they send audio vocals where there are only stinks. The longer you stink, the more you win the profile picture of the week. - 'Na satisfaction. - So just noise, no stench? Yes. And then the rule of the stink chat is that if you talk, you get killed. My brother once spoke. - Fuck? Oh no, otherwise they made him administrator! Do you know how women greet each other here? No I do not know. [IMITATE THE VERSE OF THE INDIANS] And I laugh so as not to cry. Mamma mia, we are going among the barbarians. - Look, the barbarians are to the north. - Oh well. You are ignorant... Here are the Etruscans. You are too ignorant. Beautiful, rich, but ignorant. Can I tell you? With this blond you are a fairy tale. - Is it there? - Scary. - And we annamo... - 'Na milfona. - You know, I don't like that word. - Why not? - I do not know. Looks like a slut to me. - No! - No? - You mean pussy, but old. I mean old cunt. As I have been telling you for months now, our headquarters are unsafe. What should I tell you? The fault of the past administrations, which took bribes and built badly. Yes, oh well, the fact is that now, dear mayor... the municipal orange grove building is free. And you would like to transfer the headquarters to us? - Eh. -But she doesn't have the authorization, eh! But in short, we have to wait for a collapse, should we wait? Calm down, huh! I have thought about the solution. I don't remember... Here it is. The circus tent, the one you just confiscated. Haven't you arrested all the circus performers? Sure. They were all illegal immigrants. Animals too. Indeed. Therefore... I mean, make it clear... Are you telling me that you would like to put the headquarters of the glorious Arma dei Carabinieri in the monkey tent? Temporarily. I hope that in the future you will never, and I mean never, need me. Don't threaten me, commander! Gaetano De Rosa never needs anyone! I am a man in one piece! I greet you. Hi, Dad... The in-laws are coming. What are you doing, are you coming or are you too busy saving the world? You know very well that I am against this marriage. But I don't shy away from my duties. - Then? - Oh... Mr. Mayor, can you make the market this year? As soon as you make the VAT number, I'll give it a thought. I know, you sell everything black. But in fact, come on. Enough with this black that is no longer in fashion. Come on, dad. However, as mayor you are a little asshole... _ - Mom! - It's 'either true, it is' or true... And you don't laugh... Not even under your mustache! Let's go. But who laughs? [MUSIC] - Here we are! - Star of the house! - Hello, ma '"! - How good you are, amo'. [SCREAM OF HAPPINESS] Smile, right? Hello love'"! You come... Dad, this is Riccardo. I love ', he is my dad Gaetano. - Good morning. - It's a nice day, huh? And she is my mother... Like the song, but she is my mother. She kissed her hand, did you see? But the first time you saw my father, you asked him if the veranda was forgiven! And was he?... Exactly. [MUSIC] [MUSIC] How much do I know Milanese. I love ', I already like yours. Are we sure I know from the north? I know more tanned than us! - Go, ma. - But it is... Nice. Pleasure. Amelia Ferrari Pignatelli in Loperfido. Kill, what have you had four husbands? Come here, beautiful. I know 'Mia, huh! If we had fun these two days. Annamo do some shopping that I give you a modernized one. Who dresses you? Montessori? But she is... the fish meter. She is the poaching fisher. - Think how small the world is. - Mh? That is for me. For her it's her size... But you know I remembered her a little more... thinner. - Yup? Maybe she wasn't wearing this case last time? You must be a sportsman because I've already seen her. Where is it? Aren't you a jockey at rat races? No, I was a mouse. Do you remember we came from the dealership? - No, I didn't remember. - When she made the keychain. That's a good one. And there was the croissant hanging and the hunchback beside it... Indeed I see that the hump is still there, maybe... Oh no, no hands! See that there is harmony! Seems already a family, huh! - Yes. - Who is the mice tamer? - Still? - His wife? - Ex. Haven't seen her in a long time. - And are you all still in Lilliput? Lilliput? She untied herself. How did she do it? Does the giant? - Come on... peace. - Peace. - Come on. [THE BONES CRACKLE] Peace... Hello and welcome to the wedding headquarters. In the beautiful setting of the large Miramare hotel. In the kit for the ladies, which now thing and thing they will bring you, you will find everything you need for the wedding weekend. Soon these pans will also sell us... Cafone, arrogant, presumptuous and overbearing. Inside you will find nebulizing water, basmati rice, so it doesn't overcook in your hand while you wait for the newlyweds... A stick with all the music that our boys have chosen. The gel for the nails, to always be perfect... and... a fan! Ah thank goodness. It's still hot for November. Ah, you have to come and find me at the parapharmacy. I have soy and clover on offer this month, at 19.90, so a holy hand for the caldane. Look, for information about him I still have the cycle, regular, like a Swiss watch. Be quiet. Also you will find a colorful bracelet to distinguish you from freeloaders. -1 who? The posted. Ah, sure. - There. - What ignorance... And for the kids a light brunch will be served by the pool. And for all the relatives, instead, see you at the restaurant in 22 minutes. It's a train! So let's tune the clocks as it's very accurate. Who can afford them. [APPLAUSE] - Thank you. [MUSIC] Here we are... Take a seat... I bet you choose the right. True? I choose the north. Does the chair hold? Let's hope so. Then I'll have you bring a high chair. Is it good for her? Because it doesn't get there. - No, I'm climbing. A simian instinct. Hello and welcome to the family lunch to let you know. Ricky chose the appetizer. No, sorry... Ricky, did you mean Riccardo Maria? Yes exactly, Ricky... No, every time I hear they call him Ricky, my blood vessels close up! We will put the flowers elsewhere. And our chef... will introduce you to the dishes. As an appetizer we have a specialty. A heart of organic Ponte Reale buffalo mozzarella, zero kilometer, on a cream of purple cabbage with black pepper from Sichuan from Mongolia. - But what can the chihuahua give us? - Eh, we eat a dog. This is the menu that the catering does when I have the Christmas party there in the factory. You know? Yes, we also give a few more things, cicci. Yes, apart from the oysters, then there is the idea of ​​the schiscetta that... - It's very Milan. - Our lle, on the other hand, she chose a spoonful of saffron carbonara. - Ah, though. - Bon appétit. I told you that c'aveva the cons cocks! - Saffron carbonara? - Eh! - But has your daughter gone mad? -But no, she's in love. Goodmorning everyone. Excuse me, but... that is, the wind dropped and I was there that ... No... But Commendatore? But what has been done... But then it means that... No! When she has finished being amazed, I am amazed. - But... the boy is your relative? -And sure, he's my cousin. - The hub, cousin. - Butt. Llenia's favorite uncle! - Beautiful, zi '. - Nice! Beautiful. But you are stunning, you are. A bomb, indeed. In my opinion, divorce was good for you. And there? But you don't come to see us anymore '. And of course, he's too busy with his business. - What trade? - At sea, there is traffic, right? Eh! Ah, dad, Tito was kind enough to plan my bachelor party on his mega yacht. [LAUGH] Mega yacht... So you have a yacht? Well no. For this occasion, let's say, I borrowed it from some of my entrepreneur friends that they weren't using it. Anyway, I go sailing more... Commendatore, another one around is available, eh. I prefer the helicopter, thanks. What's wrong with the helicopter? Woh. Can you get it in flight? If you want, you can come too. It certainly does not risk being taken by the shovels. -The shovels .. .- He can enter with his head held high. Because she makes her turn the blades! Well, the spinning helicopter spins the blades. But above all her. Ah, and you will see how well the Saracino goes well with the marinade. Look, between us, I don't think anyone marries well here. Mado ', I like women like her... Fine, profiterol. Sweet, but with balls. Ah... whatever you need, don't hesitate to call, huh? Oh... Well, we waited a long time, but it was worth it, huh? -You must always make a joke. - Mh... Nice er mine! It's not that the whole mozzarella is bad for us, right? Then? What do we call these tables? I was thinking about the typical names of the stylists. Chanel table, Gucci table, Prada table... Love, I don't know, huh. Isn't it cooler to put the names of the musicians? Type: The Journalists table, Social State table... No, welfare state, no. Then it seems to be at the soup kitchen. Come on, guys, but do something more original. Give them the names of those great men who have made the history of our country important. De Gasperi, Berlinguer, Grillo... Yes, let's put the Cochi and Renato table, Alberto Sordi table, Stanlio and Ollio. But what is a joke? Do you think you are witty? Like a joke? Because if there is... if there is a Beppe Grillo table, can't the Alberto Sordi table be there? Beppe Grillo is a man worthy of all these big names that I just mentioned. But be good! You, at the most, can know Maradona! Apart from the fact that Maradona, if he had been a politician, would certainly have done a better job than many others. Oh! Do we all want to calm down? Huh? Here, 'or I knew. Eh, there's a severe lack of sex in here. - I do not think so. - We want to finish it, please! But don't you realize that you are embarrassing the boys? What then today, by now, we are all in the same boat. Yes, yes, but one in the bow and the other in the stern. Don't say those words. If his wife here, Tex Willer, hears it, who knows what refined jokes come to him with stern and bow. - Ex wife. - To Santa Claus! Oh. Ué, keep the words down. Santa Claus can also be. At this point I would need a reindeer and there is her husband. I got the allusion! Gaetano and I didn't have a penny when we got married. You will understand, my father could not even see it, Communist, long-haired and also Neapolitan. Only I was in love lost. If you want to get married barefoot on the beach of Gaeta. Huh? Diego and I in the Duomo in Milan. With Pavarotti singing Schubert's Ave Maria for us. Aho, however Gaeta is a magical place for weddings. Mh? Then bring well. Oh my God, you know how it ended between me and Gaetano. Seed separated. Precisely. Bella de mamma! Huh? But how beautiful she is! No, I have to say it's crazy, come on. Yes, they've only known each other for just a month. Yes, but my son will never get used to your habits and customs. It's complicated here. '0 capitone... - Eh, eh... '0 triccheballacche, pears pè pè pè... But don't make folklore, which is the puppet opera? And well, but that's it... Rather she is my daughter who will never get used to your fog. But what fog? But if it is from Totò's films that there is no longer the fog in Milan! - For real? - Of course. Since you have overheated the planet with your ragù! Has the ragù overheated the planet? Yes. Make the ragù, boil the ragù, ragù, ragù... [WHISTLE] - But let's not say, iamme per favo ', - Oh, the hole came. - But don't make gestures. - But it's not a gesture. - Continuously. Well, the capitone is the capitone and the hole is the hole! Let's eat... This is the lemon delight, a typical dessert of Gaeta... Taste. Let's taste... Typical dessert. Huh? Like? - It's good. - You see it? I must say: you... nothing to say about food. You eat well, here you eat really well. Ah, then as far as this is concerned, you from the north are very good at eating. Eh, us too. The cassoeula... - Huh? - The meatballs. - Ah. - Rustin negàa... - Oh well, I don't want the menu now. - Saffron risotto. - Eh, huh. But I must say... this is a really nice place. My wife had made me buy some land... I wanted to build a 5-star hotel. A spatial thing, she would have given polish just... But instead... The mayor has changed. An idiot arrived and blocked my work even before leaving. -Mayor... - 'I'm a jerk. - Here's the sugar. And his Amaro del Capo ice-cold, Mr. Mayor. Ok... A smile... A little further to the left... Look at me. - Mayor? - Yup... - But is he really the mayor? - Eh. But sorry, but it means that someone also voted for it. And of course, huh! And his daughter? Who earns a living doing selfies, come on. - Selfie, dad. - Selfie, what it is. But no, we were impulsive... We had to think about it a little earlier. What the fuck is this mayor? He loved a mignottone, come on. - Shhh. The daughter who is the influencer. What family is it? We need to find a way to... - To blow up the wedding. - Eh, maybe. At least to postpone it a bit, in short, to be able to think about it a bit. I get it... I'll take care of it. Diego? Tell me what it is? - What's your face? - What do I do? Eh, tell me. What's your face? I have the face of someone who is thinking. Of one who... who reflects, who processes data, who makes the melon work. The Loperfido. The premarital photos. Let's go take the pictures go. What the fuck is this wedding photo stuff? - Pre-marital... - Eh! I've never heard it. Ready. Greetings. The work... First, we absolutely need to step up checks. First point: family tree. Second point: DNA examination. Third point: the criminal record. First, we don't want to give my daughter, your ex-girlfriend, who among other things left you undeservedly, to feed these northern sharks? Mayor, today is a holiday. I do it on Monday. No. Monday is late, you absolutely have to go now. Don't have the keys to the office? First point: I can't go to the office on a Saturday afternoon. Second point: do you remember? Work less, work everyone. - And who said 'this bullshit? - '0 mayor! The first? Don't drink that is bad for you. Do not drink. Nothing. I did not find anything. Here, don't tell me... This place is bad. Took me 2 hours to get a decent martini. I checked his profile, the forums... there is nothing online, not even gossip. It seems impossible to me. I say, how is this possible? Not even a flirtation with a Serie D footballer with a crest... Or with a neomelodic... Or a tattooed tronista... Did we find the Maria Teresa Ruta di Calcutta of the web? But what are you two up to? Do not worry. Leave it. We're just trying to figure out who this mantis is that has circuitry my brother. Oh well, apart from a bad taste in choosing accessories and that provincial makeup and a terrible mother, she could maybe be a good girl, right? Yes, of course. You invented fluorescent nails by night. You should be prosecuted, right? Me then... with all the beautiful girls in the north... For example, Barbieri's daughter, right? I say she is Brianza, she is rich and she is also a beautiful pussy. Wasn't she okay? What's up? Why isn't she a beautiful pussy? Yes, yes... Anyway if this chick has any skeletons in the closet, it is clear that she knows how to hide it well. - You have to resign yourself. Resign yourself. A Loperfido never gives up. And now I'm going out to get some fresh air. Go what stuff, it seems to be on Lake Como. Hello, am I talking to the health inspector? You absolutely must carry out a check to the great Miramare hotel. - What an idiot... Ready! But who is speaking? Love, is that you? It does not matter. I am a law-abiding citizen. Look, I'm not on duty. I'm on vacation right now. So who does the checks? Ah, I don't know. Ask that jerk mayor. Uè, that jerk of the mayor .. that jerk of the mayor would be me! Ah! It sounded like a familiar voice. Say. Inspector, please, I need you. But we don't really talk about it, mayor. But let's at least do a negotiation. What can I offer? Less controls? Water, downpour. - Food. - Gnagnarella, almost fire. - Bar? - Fuocone. Indeed arson. - Grandmother's? Very hot. Total city evacuation. Grandma's bar either. With sandwiches? OR: And oh well, grandma's bar with sandwiches, either! Without mayonnaise. It's like a lamb without a finger! With all the mayonnaise... So be it! Look, I came because we're here in the south in... on a trip, right? And then I saw... but I don't believe in these things. These are tarot cards, aren't they? - Yes, yes, they are tarot cards. - Tarot. - Slits! - What do I do? - It has to rock! - Should I get up? No, you split! - Oh well, they say I get up, I split... - We're not playing trump! These are serious business. - It's not that... - You draw a card. - I really don't believe it... - A random one? - Yup. You, this... This one. Ah... The hanged one. Hangman. Well, maybe it will be the mayor. Perhaps it is excessive, but if the cards say so. - You draw a second card. - A second card. This. - Ah. - Which is? The crazy. Permit. She summoned it, go... The madman is here. No, I'm the one who brought it. Come on, don't be shy. I was here because I came casually. No, her fantastic creature has summoned me to her, but I don't know, can I be of any use to you? But I tell you, to me the magic, a little 'I shit under, eh! Fear... - Eh, I don't know... Maybe yes. - Yup. Well, I have an idea, maybe. - Eh, eh, eh... -I tell you only once. Shh! If you screw me up for a shit cockroach, I tell my father to grow marijuana. No! What marijuana, no, it's rocket! You have dilated pupils, a flabby mouth, you smell of smoke and you are dressed up like a clown. Either you are dressed in the dark, or you made yourself a cannon. Or a cannon in the dark! Which is worse because with the lighter you never know where the cigarette is. What do you work at the CIA? I recognize a fake Vuitton from miles away. - Fashion blogger? - Exactly. - Holy shit... - It's worse than the CIA. Worse yes, the disgrace is worldwide. Listen, Nando, watch out! No! The hood of my beetle was like this, oh! - Eye! - Come on, I'm kidding "! Are you looking at me? This is your end if the newlyweds, huh! - I mean, he just hasn't settled. - What do you want this! Do not listen... - Then? - Oh. Eh! Out of season they are not found. If you are looking for strawberries at Christmas, how do you do it? How do you do? I get over my craving for strawberries and buy mandarins. - I buy the greenhouse ones. - Eh! Cultivated fruit that looks like strawberry, but isn't. But it isn't. Ah... it looks like strawberries, but it's not strawberries. I understand... Yes, but out of season they cost a lot. That's the least of your problems. - That is fine. - The last one. - Inspector. - Yup. - How did it go? - Everything good. In what sense is everything okay? Shall we put the seals? - No. - How not? I made her come on purpose. Eh, I came on purpose, but... Because it is right that we know! That under the administration of this highly decorated mayor there are no discounts! The rules are the same for everyone! So this incorruptible, upright inspector, what did he do? - I turned a blind eye. - How did you turn a blind eye? - And there was just a few cockroaches. - And that doesn't seem like much to you? And I have it in the kitchen too. I also close your other eye... Go away. - Eyes closed. I mean... - Be witty too. He go away! - I need a vacation. - He has to go on vacation! And bring your grandmother too. In any case, the bar never reopens. Tell your grandmother to bring the sandwiches as well. Co 'all the mayonnaise... And a little onion? No need, it takes the routers. Which give that crunchy tone... Go away! Cheers, guys! - Cheers! What if magnamo? Thanks. Shall we have a last toast before the wedding? But why do we have to part? I want it stays with you.

It's the mayor who orders it! - No! - Of course? Disobey the mayor? And then it is the father who speaks to you. U you have to get it back! Why isn't Ilenia happy? No, she thinks she is happy, but she is not. I tell you that I am the father and a father knows these things. That's the wrong man. "U are the right man! Who are you? Where is the first? Pri... First? First... tell me what... When my daughter left you, were you like this? [NOISES OF LUNA PARK] This is first class, 'he said. And go. I have to say, guys, hyper power and top of the range locations, that is... Bella, uncle! But how the heck do you talk, oh? Besides, I'm not your uncle. Oh well it's a way of saying, as you say "friar", isn't it? - And I have no brothers! - Oh well, nothing, uncle, sorry. - Okay, but wasn't there a surprise? - There is the surprise. You are a musician and I have summoned three crazy artists from the area. Come and see. Look how wonderful. This is Bea... Jessica! And you should be the birthday boy instead, right? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. They are Selvaggia and Debora. But where is the pole for the lap dance? - Yes, in fact, do we stick together? - I'll do the pole! Oh, good! Now hang on to the pole and let's all go inside. Attack strength, all attached. Come on, that's fun. Oh, now you're okay. But I don't see anything. But you don't have to see, you have to show yourself.

But her granddaughter can only reap the benefits! Give me. Excuse me for a moment. You explain it to him, come on. Listen to me carefully, you nerdy boy. Or make sure you get Ilenia to the yacht... and in that case you can keep the swag, the bagnarola and all, or I'll be forced to screw you up with your whole family! But sorry, but what is it, a threat? No, let's not exaggerate. Let's say we sponsor dreams here. Good. The mooring... Lazy that is nothing else. - Then? - Huh? Is it possible to know where you were? Eh, you didn't even ask me when we were married. You are jealous? Do not even mention it. But I know you're just like a dog. By the way, do you know that I want you to introduce 'Mirta? She is my friend. She is a beautician, but she knows everything about Nietzsche. You kind of like it, - Sorry, what are you smoking? - Grass. - Grass? But you went crazy. Take a puff, she watches him relax. What are you crazy? I am a public official. - But look it's legal. - Oh yes, oh well. - It's called Freejoint. - He smokes, smokes, I don't like it. It's late, where do we take the in-laws to dinner? Without in-laws. Let's go alone, you and me. What are you crazy? But you know what a bummer you and me at dinner. But what if we say? Huh? Look, I'd rather do the Brazilian wax again I did it this morning. - But you know what I'm wondering? But how come? Why did we get married? Boh! Eh! boh! - And where was the priest? - I do not know. However, I don't go to dinner with those peasants. That is fine? The prince of Gaeta spoke. But it goes... This no, eh! Eh, it's legal, but it costs money. What do we tell him at this hour? I do not know. Let's find an excuse. Let's say you have a migraine. It is your workhorse. Well no! But I'm tired of being your scapegoat, wow! But why don't you take your responsibilities once?

Wait up! Holy shit... [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] Coffee? Go for the coffee, This way. Of course... time just flies, huh? No, I want to say, it seems to me yesterday that I was taking llenia to the rides and this one marries me tomorrow. Look at that... You know that my mother... when I got married I... she told me: "remember that you can change your mind until the last moment". Well sure, she was afraid she was an asshole. She was afraid he would marry me for my money. But look, Diego is not a bad person. On the contrary. Do you know what the thing I'm sorry about lately? For my daughter Claudia. Because it looks like she is taking all her faults of hers. Too much ambition and too little heart... Seems so cute to me. 'A good girl, right? She is, indeed. You just know what? I wish she felt herself, always. That's all. And she begins to give you a good example. Tycoon this cake! All pi-pì-pì. Eh! - You're right, go. - Oh... [PIANO MUSIC] [PIANO MUSIC] [Laughs] But I told you that when I was 20, when I was married, I wasn't even pregnant. Look, just... Oh well then, they were other times, eh! But in fact I'm in a hurry to marry these two, I mean, but if she isn't... What do you say they're waiting for? And Ilenia would have told me, right? But that you told your mother everything? And no... So this means that you and I could become... Don't say it! Don't say it because, look, I get mad immediately. Uh! Hush, hush, hush... I can't stand that word. Virtually neither of them agrees with this marriage. And well, sure. A bit like what happened with the government. Nobody wanted to do it and in the end they did. Sure. But what if the boys insist on getting married? Look, with what I set up, it's very, very difficult for them to make it. - Yeah, huh? - Very. - But legal or... - Well, we're a little on the edge. - Between lusco and brusco. - Because I too... Beyond. Then it means that... it will be difficult for us to meet again. And well, you never know. Well, I mean, now that there was starting to be a bit of... Can I tell you something? What after all, but really at the bottom, at the bottom, at the bottom, eh... You are nice to me. - I like you too. - Oh yes? - Yes, really. So... do we want to sign this pact? And how do you want to initial it? There is nothing more to drink. - Nazarene! - Reno! Nazarene? But ndo 'is it? Oh, let's make the Nazarene covenant! - Uh... Nazarene has left us. - Is Nazarene dead? No, he left us the note. Stop it, but you close. [COMES A MESSAGE] - Oh, what is it? Oh... - But was it a good idea? - Bad. But it might work.

Do you want to kill me before you become a grandfather? No, don't say this word. I hate this word. U think we have to mix the DNA. - Eh, exactly. - Think if he is tall like you? Think if he is as fat as you are. Think if he is tall like you and fat like me. Anyway we have to hurry to get to the yacht. - We must hurry! - And how do we get there? Nobody answers.

The boys, left with sirens. - Did the police take him away? - No police! They will have gone after the girls you got him. - No, that he got him! -the? With your money. Keep your voice down. I was supposed to save the boat, what the fuck were you supposed to save? We realized we were wrong and now we are here because we want to solve the situation. Good boy! Real men are the ones who admit they were wrong. - Cicero? - No, this is Gattuso. - The painter? - But... That's dull, like you. -But he's wrong .. .- Gottuso, Gattuso. You are ignorant! It is a vocal! | [THE MOBILE PHONE RINGS] - He's my father. Can I answer? Absolutely not. He doesn't answer, he doesn't answer... he doesn't answer! Look, I told you, we haven't done anything wrong. Yes, certainly. Okay... oh well. And I'm Raffaella Carrà. She wouldn't look bad blonde... I want to talk to the carabinieri! Help, commander! They stole my train and I even saw who did it. Mayor! You see it! Carramba what a surprise... Silence! Do you want to see how nice it is to stay in a cell from Trieste downwards? Ah? Silence! Stay there. _ How is it made of the mayor? And very interesting is what... - I was holding a train that was too beautiful! - He's really stupid! Cazzarola, but who could have done such a thing? - A cat? - 'Na panther! Eh, I would have an idea, but I really hope I'm wrong. What's now? Eh, what do you do? And what do you do, girls? Needle and thread... Needle and thread, come on!

Your father, for example, I love you. But if you miss it, go to the market and you're on your mother too! But chillo is like that. Just think, when he was a child and we used to come here on vacation... he measured the height at all the sand castles and then said: "the holes cannot be done, because they are already on the road". And he ran to spy on the lifeguard. The other children 'o were always hitting. - And they did well. - Were they right? [RING YOUR PHONE] Aspe ', I'll show you something... It is a sign of destiny. It is an "i Ilaria is written on the heart! Oh well, but you were with Ilenia. It's not worth it. Why not? She is worth. You say? Come with me. Did you see those two making out?

Did you see what? And her ex-boyfriend. But it's still them! They are the worst, the most dangerous! Not at all! The ex-boyfriend is like in football.

But how often happens for a stag or hen party, in short, those parties, how many will she have done? Come on. I will never understand you... Having established that it was his fault, why doesn't he let us go at least? So I'm going to find my girlfriend that I have to marry. And it's not that simple, my dear. Eh, no... We are talking about aggravated theft here. Eh, aggravated theft! Commander, please. Practically here there is a wedding to celebrate. And she is the only person... who can help us.

They had some kind of bachelorette party... - For real? - Yup. - What a bitch. - Oh well... It was him. He wanted to tell him. She explain to him. - So it was you? - Yes, but it's an innocent thing. It is not a serious thing. It dates back to when they were in elementary school. Just children. - You both make me sick! - Calm down, come on. Sorry, but what do you care about llaria? - Ilaria? - Eh! But I don't give a shit about Ilaria! And did you tell me, ndo 'sta llla'? Ila-Ilaria, no llle-Ilenia. You wanted sape 'de llenia. Nooo!

Toast with me. But what are you doing here? I celebrate your freedom. What the fuck have you been drinking, Claudia? Look, I can't find llenia anymore, then his dad and his father started a mess. Now she doesn't want me anymore and I don't know what the fuck to do! Maybe this is my fault too. Look, I... I know you all think this wedding is... kid stuff. But I really love her, Claudia. Do you know what it means to look a woman in the eye and find yourself in it? Yup, I think yes. Why is it so hard to love someone? I do not know. It shouldn't be, but you're right. I think you've grown up, you know? And I'm a very big bitch. - What are you saying... I've spent too much time with dad... and little time with you. Come here... If it were the last thing I do, you are getting married today. Ok? - Yes we go. Slowly, slowly, slowly, oh. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] But let it go ', come on. I'm sorry. Why does he have to tell you you make him sick? That is,.. - No, no, we make him sick. -No, he was talking to you. He was there too...- No, she spoke in the plural. He could also hear, come on... What is it? What happened? Oh my God... What happened to the bride's dress? - We found it in tatters. - Is it possible to know where you have been? Hot! But doesn't it burn you? I like the warmth of the sheep. Of course if someone wanted us to give up this marriage in this way, now they certainly succeeded. Yes, we did, because this is a guilt contest, huh! Oh well, now we have to get an idea. I want to save my daughter's marriage. A little girl. Get her to come every now and then, right? A little girl... - It takes an idea. - An idea, Gaeta '. Once. - Why are you looking at me? - But why are you the mayor! - Hate! Mom! - What's Gaeta '? You're not OK? Hot! Mom... my mom. - Why, what is your mom doing? - And the solution. - Here?. [RUSSIAN] - We exaggerated. - It must be done. Marriage must be done. Of course. Now it has really become a matter of principle. Sure, good. Guys, the coffee, .. He made it, I won't answer, eh. Ilenia, it's nonsense... Mama's darling, nun... I love'? - Treasure? I love" It can be fixed... Mom, please, I appeal to your grandmother's love. Leave it to me. - Madam... - Hello. - Thanks Mom. - Thanks Mom. What "thank you mom". This is mom only to me. Market, twice a week and without invoices. I'm wrong... she's a mom to you too. [RUSSIAN] [BIRD STRAP] Aren't you ashamed of what you've done? - I can't find it anymore! - Did they warn you? But warned what? You managed to ruin the only beautiful thing you had in life! But why are you so aggressive? Look, I've never been against your marriage. Ah, no? In fact, you sent me escorts. But it was him, it was! You only cared about this marriage because you hoped I would quit the music and take care of your fucking business. He is right. Then why do you want to leave your fucking business to him? I want to follow her. Guys, to save the fucking business, I got an ass like that. Your grandfather had eaten everything. Your grandfather, your mother's father. With poker, with horses, with whores. Boys! Azz ', then it's just a family tradition, I see. Oh, but how dare you? But mind your business. No, sorry, sorry. Go ahead. No problem. It's just that I woke up now... oh well. And... where is he? Miss... Miss, is coffee possible? You know what? It's just that you never asked me what I wanted to be. U don't even look at us. I do a bunch like this in the company, every day, and you don't even look at me. - You're right, you're right. No, I'm an asshole, actually... But it is really a generational fact. Our generation has always thought about working and bringing home some money and did not relate to their children. I love you, I'm so sorry. I swear to you that I love you very much. And you go to find your girlfriend, your future wife, who has returned. I saw it myself. Go... Excuse me. I really love you... and I never told you how much I respect you. I'm sorry. Excuse me. You are right... Oh! What are you doing? - No, it's just that I was moved. - But get your hands on? Oh well, but now we are family! But which family? Which family? - But can I call you dad? - No, you can't, you can't. You must not. Stelli ', look I went to check' mo. Look at that grandmother is a war machine. You're almost done, huh! Ma, at least you don't piss me off, though. Ile, honey, I've been looking for you. Wow what a pie. It's huge, but haven't you exaggerated? We are four cats. I know it. It looks like Clerici's dress. No, when ever. Anyway, if you wanted me to destroy the marriage, you did it, huh! But I didn't make the cake myself. Oh, but do you always want to fuck around? - Since Riccardo... - You don't have to name him! He's a crazy cool guy and not just because he's good. But he is special. But what do you know, huh? You haven't talked to him for five minutes. What the fuck do you know! You don't give a damn about others! Why are you like that, dad! In your opinion, I was happy to make the parcel between you and mom? Sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Of everything. What do I owe you... Believe me, it's not easy to be a father. For a right you do, you're wrong five. It's not an excuse, I know, I have the mania of wanting to control everything. | But that's how I'm made... And the only way I know to take care of the people I love. I realize that you have become a woman. You taught me a lot these days about love. - Ile... - I love! She finally she found her. - Do you still want me? - I always want you. Um... sorry. Now that this Brazilian soap opera is over, can we go get dressed? Huh? Otherwise we do a baptism instead of a wedding. But baptism of whom? - Well, about your baby, right? - But I'm not expecting any children. No, here, maybe in a few years. Sorry, but who is it that you put around this bullshit? - [Together] Them. -the? She had told the fortune teller that you were a viper. Don't you dare call it a viper to the president of your company! - I beg you. - i you cheated us. - Eh! I understand, Gaeta ', but I no longer knew how to stop! - Viper! - You already said that. - Bitch! - Good boy. Bitches! Come on, enough is enough, huh! You broke the fuck! Oh! I hate weddings, okay?
