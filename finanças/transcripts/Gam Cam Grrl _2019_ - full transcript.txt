(film reel rolling) (soft string music) (static humming) - [Rob] From NPR News in Washington, I'm Rob Westerfield with these top stories at the bottom of the hour. An irrepressible website that went viral over the Christmas weekend is causing considerable consternation in governments around the globe. The site streams an unflinching live up-skirt view of a woman's genitals as she goes about her daily activities. Even the United States has been unsuccessful in shutting it down. To gain more insight into this breaking story we have our Pentagon correspondent Chandra Mitterandra on the line. Good morning, Chandra. - [Chandra] Good morning, Rob. - [Chandra] Several sources I've talked to fear this untraceable website could be the opening salvo of a foreign Cyber attack on the U.S. to probe and possibly even penetrate our digital defenses. - [Rob] But both China and Russia... (speaking in foreign language) - My alarm didn't go off. - I'm going to make dumplings tonight. Your favorite. - Mmm. Thanks, Mom. I'll be back at five. - Okay, okay. - [Rob] Therefore should have the ability to pull the plug on it. - [Chandra] I brought that up to Thomasine Woodley earlier... ♪ There's a door I came through to get onto this train ♪ ♪ And before that I stood in the station ♪ ♪ To keep out of the rain ♪ ♪ On this train between stations ♪ ♪ Chasing the horizon ♪ ♪ Train between stations ♪ ♪ No one is sure of its true destination ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - [Crowd] Hungry Lice. - [Announcer] Level three. (grunting) - I see you're reading about the Gam Cam Grrl. - Oh, I just, uh, couldn't help but read it, right there on the front page staring me right in the, Face! Wow. That's it? That's what it looks like? - Don't tell me you've never seen one of these before? - Yeah, of course, but not on someone's phone like that. - Come on, you never did any sexting in high school? - Uh, no, I never did. - What's that thing on your leg? - What, what thing? - That thing on your ankle? That's not an up-skirt camera is it? - No. - If it is, I'm really gonna be pissed. - No. It's a GPS tracking device. I have to wear it for the next three years while I'm on parole. - Parole? - Yeah, I just got out of prison about a month ago. Right before Thanksgiving. - What were you in prison for? - Bank robbery. I know it sounds bad but it wasn't like I walked up to the teller window with a gun or anything. - [Announcer] Game over! - She took a shower yesterday but she was wearing a mask. Gloves too. She's always wearing gloves when her hand gets anywhere near the proscenium. Speak of the devil. - She's waking the wombat again. - Same time as yesterday. - Something wrong with the monitor? - No. No, it's on. It's just a short in her lighting system. - No, this is definitely deliberate. She's flashing the lights on and off in Morse Code. (gentle music) - The 14 numbers displayed in Morse Code match the Bureau of Prisons ID number and release date for inmate Shane Mathias Antar. Recently released on parole from the Federal Penitentiary at Victorville. He currently lives with his mother in the Palms area of Los Angeles. Notify the L.A. office I'm on the next flight out. - 21 violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He hacked the Bank of Western Ems Levee in Germany. Made off with almost 10 million euros. - And he gave all that money away to charities I remember that. He was a sort of a folk hero in the hacking community for a while. The Robin Hood of the Internet, they called him. - His father was an American citizen. Taught English at Shanghai U. Shane's mother was one of his students. She was 19 when they got married, moved back to Los Angeles where Shane was born in 1989. - I just tapped into the GPS on Shane's ankle monitor. He's near the corner of Hill and Third. A business called Greater Prose Groceries and Books. - Yeah, but Fool, what'd you expect her to do when you told her you were a bank robber though? - I thought she'd appreciate honesty. - There he is on Aisle T. Do we have audio yet? - Trying to hack into his phone mic now. - I see the terms of his parole prohibit him from using any devices with internet access. So that's why he's got any old flip phone. - I just broke into his phone. It was not easy, believe me. - Dude, it's part of the mating ritual. You have to fluff up your fricken feathers like the peacocks do. You can't let 'em think that you're some run-a-the-mill turkey out in the barnyard trying to get some tail. - Where's the tarragon? - All spices are on Aisle S, between Sense and Sensibility and Stranger In A Strange Land. - Thanks. - Welcome. Hey. Hey, fool. When's the last time you got any? - Seven years. - Damn! My bad. - It was the night before I went in. Debra. My last girlfriend in college. - Fool, you have to learn how to lie if you wanna get laid. No girl is gonna hook up with some guy that just got out of the slammer. Especially one that's bagging groceries for $10 an hour. - I'm not looking for a one-night stand. I want a real relationship. - Yeah, good luck with that. - Oh, gotta love those Greater Prose salads. Is that a Sunflower Serenade? - No, it's Arugula Quinoa Tango. - Oh, that's a good one too. Hey. I'm Karol. - Shane. - Pleasure meeting you, Shane. So you, uh, you work at Greater Prose? - Yeah. Uh, part-time. I'm finishing up my doctorate at UCLA. - Sounds like he's taking his buddy's advice and feeding her a load of bull. - Either that or they're talking in code. - FBI has boots on the ground for remote visual. - Getting facial recognition on the contact now. I've got a match. Caroline Miriam Angelikis. 29 years old. Aspiring stand-up comic. Presently unemployed. - Do you ever go to comedy clubs? - No. Sounds like fun though. - Well that's great you said that because I'm doing a five minute spot at the Mata Hari tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday. I've been doing Sunday open mics there for years and this is the first time they've given me an actual time slot that I can put on cards so I can give them to people to come out. I really need a good turn-out. - 8:00 p.m. I'll be there. - Great, awesome! Okay, thanks so much, I'll see you then. And bring as many friends as you can! Like a lot. A lot of friends and people. Mom, dog, parents, grandparents. - [Announcer] Hungry Lice. (grunting) - Hi. Oh, I see you're playing Hungry Lice. What level are you at? - Level Seven. - Cool. I'm at level eight. Speaking of eight, I'm doing a show tonight at The Mata Hari, at 8:00. - I don't do comedy. - Well, why don't you give it to somebody who does. Sleep tight. Don't let the hungry lice bite. - [Announcer] Game over! (phone rings) - Hey, Mom! - They're speaking Mandarin. - I knew a major player like China had to be behind something as sophisticated as this. - I wonder how you say proscenium in Chinese? ♪ She's gonna eat you alive ♪ ♪ She's gonna eat you alive ♪ ♪ She's gonna eat you alive ♪ ♪ She's gonna eat you alive ♪ ♪ She's gonna start at your feet ♪ - Let's give a warm, Mata Hari Club welcome for the Miss, Lovely, Karol Angelikis! ♪ And then she'll keep on chomping all the way up ♪ ♪ Without stopping you'll become another dropping ♪ - Thank you, Harold. And I wanna thank all of you for coming out tonight. All six of you. Well, all seven if you include the waitress. Uh, and while I'm thanking everybody for coming I wanna call out a special thanks to you, Harold, for not coming in my mouth last night. (chuckles) Um, any L.G.B.T. folks in the audience tonight? Come on, come on, don't be shy. Be proud! Yeah, you! Which letter are you? I mean, you're obviously not an L so you're either a G, B or T, so which one is it? - G. - G! Gee whiz, I would have never guessed. I mean, it's so hard to tell what anybody is now these days with all the letters going around, it's like you walk into a singles bar and it's like diving into a bowl of alphabet soup. It's not even LGBT anymore, now it's LGBTQ. And some people take it even further and say it's LGBTQAI. I mean at this rate in another year or so we're gonna sing the entire fucking Alphabet Song just to get somebody's sexual preference. But for brevity's sake, since I only have like five minutes up here or something, uh, we'll just stick with LGBTQ, shall we? Hey, Mister Gee, do you know what the Q stands for in LGBTQ? - Queer or questioning. - Queer or questioning. There's some irony here, folks. Here I am, questioning a gay guy about queer or questioning, so therefore I must qualify as a Q because of the mere fact that I am asking a question. So, thank you, Mr. G, for clarifying my sexual orientation. I have now officially joined the LGBTQ community because I am, in fact, a Q because I'm questioning what the fuck the letter Q means. Am I making myself perfectly queer? Hey! What? What the, I, five, what? You can't give me my cut-off cue already! Boy, five minutes flies by fast when you're on stage having fun, doesn't it folks? You know, maybe I should have let the M.C. come in my mouth last night so I can slide an extra minute on my routine. But the point I was trying to make, and I had this whole monologue prepared to say it, is that we're, we're all part of the LGBTQ community because we're all questioning, we're all Q's. Even this cute little Asian guy over here. Hey, Mr. LGBTQ, what kind of sandwich are you eating? - A BLT. (laughing) - I rest my case, ladies and gentlemen! ♪ When digestion's complete ♪ - Let's hear it for Miss Karol Angelikis. - That's Karol with a K. - Okay. We'll have, uh, Tommy Miller up in five minutes so you guys stick around. - Did you get the BLT line? - No, that gay guy's head was in the way. - (sighs) Oh! Sam, wasn't it? - Shane. - Oh yeah, Shane. Um, Shane, honey, I need you to come over to my apartment and bring the rest of this sandwich. Hey, can we get a doggie-bag over here? ♪ She's gonna eat you alive ♪ - A BLT? - Uh, like one more time but with a little bit more emotion. - A BLT. - Uh, no, let's try it one more time: what kind of sandwich are you eating over there, Mr. LGBTQ? - A BLT. - Uh, a little less forced. - A BLT. - And, cut. That's a wrap. - Okay, I'll have this edited in and up on YouTube in about a half an hour. - Thank you so much for doing this, Shane. You are such a doll. - No biggie. Glad I could help. - Uh, can I get you anything to drink? You want, like, a rum 'n coke? - Uh, you have any orange juice? - Yes, I do, in fact. I have now officially joined the LGBTQ community because I am, in fact, a Q because I'm questioning what the fuck the letter Q means. I make a pretty bad-ass screwdriver. Am I making myself perfectly queer? Hey, Lulu, um, didn't you say that you have some editing software back at home on your home computer that you could use? - It really doesn't matter, I um... Oh, you know, yeah, I have some better software at home. Um, I'll see you tomorrow. Nice meeting you, Shane. - Oh, bye, Lulu. - Bye. - So you wanna screwdriver, Shane? - Uh, to be honest, I never really liked the taste of vodka. - Then why don't we cut to the fucking chase then.

I spent the last seven years in prison for bank robbery. - Oh, uh-huh. Bank robbery. What's it gonna be next, you know, my last ex-boyfriend was a car thief. Who's it gonna be now?

Guess who's going back to Victorville? - Come on. Say goodbye, Gracie. - Curt Dunkin, FBI. I just received orders to take Mr. Antar into federal custody. - On whose authority? - Thomasine Woodley, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command. - Can't get much higher than that now, can ya? - I'm Shane's parole officer from the Department of Corrections. Would someone mind telling me what this is all about? - I'm sorry. That's classified. (intense music) - Wipe your mouth, Shane. You look like you ate a glazed donut. What do you know about the Gam Cam Grrl? - Today is the first day I even heard of her. It was on the radio. I saw the article in The Times too. Oh, and this girl on the train showed it to me on her phone. - This morning she relayed a message in Morse Code. 14 numbers identical to your Prison Register ID and release date. - Has to be a coincidence. - Coincidence, with the odds a million times higher than winning the lottery. - I'm telling you: I didn't even know about her till today. I'm not allowed to use the internet so I get my news the old-fashioned way. You know: newspapers and TV. Sometimes even the radio. - We're willing to pay you $5,000 a week plus medical and dental. We'll get the DOC to drop the restrictions on your internet access just help us find who's responsible for this. - I really appreciate the job offer, but like I said: I don't want to work for the NSA. I'd rather work at the grocery store. - The third house on the right. - How do you know where I live? - Shane, the NSA knows everything. (gentle music) - Hey, wanna heat dinner for you? - No, that's fine, I already ate. I had a sandwich at the comedy club. - Oh. Hey, how's your date? - Not so good. Started out fine, but things sort of ended on a sour note. - What went wrong? - Yeah, I didn't want her to know I was a convicted felon. So I lied about who I was. - You don't have to lie. Just be yourself. Somebody will love you the way you are. - Right, Mom. ♪ She's gonna start at your feet ♪ - [MC] Let's give a warm, Mata Hari Club welcome for the Miss, Lovely, Karol Angelikis! - How many times do I have to tell you, Karol? All men are liars. - Thank you, Harold. - Just like your father. - Yeah, you're probably right about that. And I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight. And while I'm thanking everybody for coming I wanna call out a special thanks to you, Harold, for not coming, in my mouth last night. Any LGBT folks in the audience tonight? C'mon, you! - What, are you watching television? - No, it's my YouTube video from last night. I only have five views. Did you watch it, Mom? I sent you the link. - When are you gonna get a real job, Karol? You're almost 30 years old. - Comedy is a real job, Mom! Come on, we've had this conversation like a million times. - I cannot be supporting you the rest of your life. You need to get a real job. You need to find a decent man. And you need to settle down before it's too late! - I rest my case, ladies and gentlemen. - You know and stop sleeping with all those criminals you keep bringing home. - The happy nap DNA analysis traces Shane's lineage back to Emperor Genghis Khan. - Who isn't related to Genghis Khan? The guy had over 4,000 children with more than 2,000 wives. Do the exponential math on that one. - She's waking the wombat again. - 7:30 a.m., Pacific Standard time. - [Both] Same time as yesterday. - [Lydia] And the day before. - She seems to be establishing a fixed event schedule like the broadcast networks do. - To get the audience to tune in at a specific time. Why? - Twice as much usage as yesterday's wombat awakening. - That's why. She's growing her audience. When was the last time she watered the calla lilies? - About 3 1/2 hours ago at 3:43. - This is different. - Yesterday it was blinking the lights in Morse Code. - Today it's blackjack? - I see more than two cards. - New style of Texas Hold 'Em, maybe? - She's definitely got something up her sleeve. - My name is Cami Fawlkes. I think outside the box? - Apparently Fawlkes is pronounced Fox. - The name of me. Contains the key. To opening the locks. - It's a poem. The name of me contains the key. - It's almost like Guy Fawkes, except she spells her name with an L in it. - Maybe the L is the key? - Let's run the full limerick through the Jaguar at Oak Ridge, see if it can uncover any hidden gems. - Any luck getting Shane Antar on board to join our team? - No, I drew a blank. I did get a good read on him on our ride home last night. He's an altruist, for sure, but with this self-righteous streak. Possibly even a trace of what they like to call The Mighty Mouse Syndrome. - He wants to be the one who saves the day! - Exactly. - Well, If we wanna catch Mighty Mouse, I think I found the perfect damsel in distress. - I should have listened to my mother. I mean, she warned me about dating criminals. But did I listen? Of course not. So last night I went home with this convicted felon. Bank robber. Just got out on parole. I'll call him Mr. LGBTQ because he was sitting right there eating his BLT. So we get back to my apartment and he starts going down on me and you know how some guys just kind of dawdle around down there like they're about to fill out a government form to ride the wild bull in the rodeo, but this guy was no slouch, okay, this guy knew his geography, and when I say Geography it's with a Capital G, like G-spot, ladies! Okay, so he's eating me out and I'm sitting there thinking where the fuck did this guy learn to eat pussy like this? He sure as shit wasn't gettin' no pussy in prison! I mean, maybe he's some kind of like fucking prodigy like Mozart or something. I don't know. Whatever the case, but there I was on my bed blasting off like a fucking rocket ship to Mars when hey, what's this? Deja vu all over again? - Caroline Miriam Angelikis? - Uh, yeah? Is there a problem? - We have a warrant for your arrest. - Wait, arrest? For what? - Assaulting a police officer in the line of duty. - Huh, oh, yeah yeah, I saw this act at a friend's bachelorette party one time, yeah. Um, where's the boom box, guys? Did one of my friends put you up to this? - Step down, please. - What? - You have the right to remain silent. - Oh, okay, wait! This is getting way too realistic here. Oh, so the punchline of the story is: if only I would have listened to my mother I could have just become a dental hygienist and married a doctor! Maybe a lawyer! Hey, wait! I could really use a lawyer right now! Is there a fucking lawyer in the house? (dramatic music) I slapped his wrist because he had his grubby fingers in my panty drawer! - It's still assault and battery on a peace officer in the line of duty. Punishable by up to 20 years in jail. has just completed its fifth day of unfettered operation without any government being able to shut it down. We have Deputy Director of the National Security Agency, Thomasine Woodley on the line to discuss the global ramifications of this, immediately after this commercial. - Hello? - Shane! Shane? - Yes? - Hi. Yeah. It's Karol. Karol Angelikis. Um, I'm, I'm really sorry I'm calling you so late right now but I... - No, I'm the one who should be sorry for lying to you the way I did. - Oh, yeah yeah, that's all water under the bridge. - Hey, uh, how'd you get my number? - Uh, they gave it to me here at the police station. - Are you in some kind of trouble? - Yeah, listen, okay, I'm in really deep shit. And they said you're the only one who can pull me out from under the pile. ♪ No one is sure of its true destination ♪ - Okay, here's the deal: if my client, during his employment with the NSA, helps to uncover the source of this Gam Cam Grrl network, he will be granted a full presidential pardon and his entire criminal record will be expunged. - That's a tall order. We're gonna have to go through the appropriate channels. - I think for something as important as this, you can go right to the top. - [Man] Sorry to disturb you at this late hour, Mr. President. - [President] No problem, Doug, I was still up tweeting about this Gam Cam Grrl thing. I think I got it figured out, I've had a lot of experience in that area, you know. Know who I think is behind it all? North Korea. Think about it: Pyongyang. Pyongyang! Get it? It's just a few letters off from Poontang! - Thank you. I'll be on the corner of First and Main in about a minute. - Shane! Mmmm. Thank you for getting me off. - You're welcome. - How'd you do it? - I just licked the alphabet is all. - No, no, no I'm not talking about last night, I'm talking about tonight. Like, how did you get them to drop all my charges? - I took a job at the Federal Building up the street. Starts tomorrow. Can we walk? I have a cab coming for me downstairs. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, what's your new job? - They want me to help them find the Gam Cam Grrl. - Wait, that cunt that keeps showing her twat on the internet? Are you serious, Shane? That's really funny, that's definitely not your new job... - I'm not kidding, Karol. That's my new job. And it comes with full medical and dental benefits. - Okay. Hey, uh, why don't we just have the cab take us back to my place. You know, we can pick up where we left off last night you know, before we were so rudely interrupted! Come on in.

Oh my God, Shane, come down with me to the Mata Hari with me it's gonna be... - I'd love to, but it's almost midnight and I start my new job at seven in the morning. - Okay, um, alright, I gotcha. 'My house is your house' I want you to move in with me and be my boyfriend. - Really, just like that? We haven't even... - Yes, no, shush. I know a good thing when I see it and you're the best fucking thing that's ever happened to me, okay? When I get home tonight I'm gonna ride you like a horse in the fucking Kentucky Derby! First place! Blue ribbon. Blue skies, nobody in the lead. Just us. Riding into the sunset. I'm gonna ride you, your dick, into the sunset. Bye, I'll be back! (phone rings) - Chad, I want you to bring Shane up to speed on everything we have on the Gam Cam Grrl up to this point. - You got it. - And at lunch hour, take him shopping for a new suit. You can use the agency credit card. - Thanks. - We must maintain a certain office decorum. - Can't dress too cas to sit at a desk and stare at a vagina all day. - Oh. That reminds me, Shane, I forgot to give you a copy of this. The Gam Cam Grrl website not only poses a threat to national security, but it does present a unique challenge to our rules against inappropriate office banter. Without a system of politically correct euphemisms in place, it would be hard not to use words that could be construed as sexual harassment. - Pretty hefty book. - Well, there are a lot of words and phrases that are inappropriate in an office environment. And the V-word happens to be one of them. - I mean, it's a pretty cool deal, actually. Ah, I mean, like, they gave me this new suit. And look what else I got, eh? Now that my parole restrictions are lifted. - Huh. Yeah! Now we can, uh, now we can FaceTime each other when you're at work. - Actually, the office I work in is called an SCIF. - SCIF? - It stands for Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. We need to check in our phones at the security desk in the lobby. It's kind of funny, really. The NSA, the ultimate hackers are afraid of their own phones being hacked. Just goes to show what goes around comes around. - What? Wait, some of these, like, word substitutions are fucking, like, hysterical! I don't, I don't get it. Like, this is real. Is this real? Is this like... - That's what they gave me. - (chuckles) What? - You can't say words like penis or pussy or vagina at work to avoid the potential for sexual harassment. - Oh, that's fucking bullshit. So are you coming to see my show tonight at 10:00? - I'll be there. Should I order a BLT? - (chuckles) What? You're so cute. I'm really glad you're with me Shane. Like, you bring me so much good luck. Like, I have agents coming out to see me tonight. Like, do you know how hard it is to get an agent in this fucking town? - Actually, I don't know much about show business to tell you the truth. - Well, stand-up comedy is like one of the hardest fields to make it in. And an opportunity like this comes around maybe once in your fucking lifetime, or sometimes it doesn't. But, when we get home tonight, I am gonna give you the best fuck you've ever had in your life. ♪ There's a door I came through on the day I was born ♪ ♪ But the truth is I just can't remember ♪ ♪ Whatever came before ♪ (phone rings) - Hi, Mom. What's up? - Oh, I, I'll be right home. ♪ Ooh, while these wheels are still turning ♪ ♪ I want you to take me there ♪ ♪ Take me there on this train between stations ♪ ♪ Chasing the horizon ♪ ♪ Train between stations ♪ ♪ No one is sure of its true destination ♪ ♪ Separate observations ♪ ♪ Through the different windows ♪ ♪ Train between stations everyone here ♪ ♪ Has their own explanation ♪ ♪ Train ♪ - Dusty! - Ma? Ma, wake up. Wake up. - I'm gonna call 911. - (moaning) Oh. - So my new boyfriend works for the NSA. He's on a special task force to crack the Gam Cam Grrl code. So, that's right, my boyfriend gets to stare at another girl's twat for eight hours a day. And to top it off: no one at the NSA office is allowed to use the word vagina or pussy or crotch or snatch or coot-coot or any other normal word that you would usually use to describe a woman's vajayjay. No, because they have this bullshit zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy. I mean, so when they wanna talk about the Gam Cam Grrl's crotch they have to use the word proscenium. Can you believe it? Can you? No. Proscenium. Like, when did our government become so Greek all of a sudden? And, and then the clit, the clit is called upstage and then the buttocks is called downstage and, and the asshole, get this, the asshole is referred to as the backstage exit. - [Man] Where's centerstage? - Buddy, if you don't know where centerstage is, it's obvious you've never gotten to second base. Now, where was I? Oh, oh yeah: So when my boyfriend goes down on me now, I have to say: yeah, yeah, right there! No no no, little bit more upstage! Well, actually stage left. No, no, more stage right. Like, when the fuck did I become a fucking choreographer all of a sudden? I mean, with all the frustrated ex-theater majors that now work in the Human Resources Department, you know somebody's got an ex-Pat Australian somewhere. Yeah. You wanna know why I think that? - [Man] Why? - Because every morning when the Gam Cam Grrl masturbates at exactly 7:45 on the dot, our intrepid NSA overlords don't just call it like it is, like, "Oh she's fingering herself again, Joe," or "She's diddling herself again, Chad." No. No, in order to avoid being fired for inappropriate office banter they have to say, are you ready for this, she's waking the wombat. I kid you not. Waking the wombat. Those are where your tax dollars are going folks. People get paid six-figure salaries to come up with this shit. (crowd applauds) (siren blaring) - I don't want to jump to any conclusions until we get all the results back from the lab. With the holiday weekend, that'll probably not be until the middle of next week. Now until then, all we can do is sit back and let's hope for the best. - Thank you. - I'm scared. - Don't worry, Mom. Everything's gonna be all right. Let's try to think positive. Okay? Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Yeah. I'm good. (pensive music) - I think outside the box. (phone dings) the name of me contains the key to opening the locks. - Human Resources had to revise the appropriate word substitution guide to compensate for the classified terms that were compromised. - This is classified information, Shane. - You can't divulge it to anyone who doesn't have top secret clearance. - Yeah, not your mother. Not your priest... - And definitely not your foul-mouth girlfriend. - I think I have something here. - What? IMac for sale, 4K? - It brought up this listing on Craigslist for a 2002 vintage iMac selling for $4,000. Similar posts for the exact same model are going for 10, maybe $25 max. So this one is humongously overpriced. - How did you come up with iMac for sale 4,000? - The letters F and W are worth four points each. So I used the numerical value of those in lieu of the letters to spell iMac for sale, 4K. - Wow, we've had the Jaguar computer at Oak Ridge and the entire cryptography staff at San Antonio and Augusta working on this non-stop and they haven't come up with anything remotely like this. Shane, this is, well it's bordering on insanity. - Hacking is more of an art than a science, in my opinion. - So you're going to respond to the ad with a limerick? - I'm responding in kind to the limerick she dealt in front of her twah, I'm sorry, I meant to say pudendum, proscenium, proscenium. That's what I meant, uh, sorry, old habits die hard. - We're no longer calling it a proscenium. That word has been compromised. The new word for that portion of the female anatomy is... Hm, the cavern. - Cavern. I'll have to remember that next time I go spelunking. - This is serious, Shane. It's inappropriate to joke about it. - Sorry. - Let's see what you've got. My name is Shane Antar, I'm searching near and far, to find a place, for face to face, perhaps your local bar? - I had to make it rhyme. At first I was going to end it with: To find a place for face to face to find out who you are but I thought that might be a bit presumptuous so I ended with the bar line. So here it goes. Where it ends up, nobody knows. - You're grasping at straws here, Shane. I think that you should spend your time here at the office a little more productively and I would suggest starting with studying the revised appropriate word substitution guide. - Whoa. It's almost one o'clock. I need to meet Karol for lunch in 15 minutes. - And tell her to scrub the classified bits from her comedy routine or there's going to be hell to pay! (bright classical music) - [Announcer] Hungry Lice! (grunting) (phone rings) - Hi. - Hi, Shane. Sorry, I'm running late. - I'm on a tight schedule, uh, I went ahead and ordered you a Thai Iced Tea. - Thanks, uh, you know what those fucking pricks you work for did? They took my YouTube post down for my show last night. Like, those motherfuckers! It already had over 35 million views! - They told me to tell you not to use the classified stuff anymore. - You knew about it but you didn't do anything to stop those fucking bastards from doing it? - Karol, I'm just a minnow in a very large ocean over there. I'm just trying to follow the rules so I don't get sent back to prison. - Whatever. Thank God you got me a drink. I'm thirsty as shit. Mm, that hits the spot right there. So, anything new and exciting on the worldwide pussy safari? - They really came down on me about talking about this with anybody. It's top secret, Karol, okay? And, besides, I've gotta go in 15 minutes, so I'd rather not spend what little's left of my lunch, like, talking about work. (slurping) - Well, speaking of work, I just signed with an agent this morning. - Oh, congratulations! - Thank you! Oh, um, uh, so how's your Mom? - She's doing much better this morning. Thanks for asking. Gosh, she really did give me a scare last night. You know, my father died of a heart attack while I was in the Pen. She was all alone for the past couple years, (phone rings) - Oh, shoot! Oh my gosh, I have to take this. Sorry, hold on. Hi, hi, Bruce, well, what's up? Jimmy Fallon? New, oh right, wait, in New York? Are you serious? Oh, my God, wait, what time's the flight? Hell yeah! I mean, okay, okay, I'm there! Oh my God! (laughs) I just, Shane, my agent just got me a flight to New York! I'm gonna be on The Jimmy Fallon Special tomorrow night! You're coming with me! You're gonna come with me to this! - It sounds great. What time's your flight leave? - Oh, it's, it's in three hours. - Oh, I, I can't just, like, cut out on work like that, I'll just, I'll take a later flight. - Okay, yeah. That's fine. I'm gonna text you my room when I check into the Plaza, Hotel and it's gonna be so romantic. Oh, you know what, I gotta go! I gotta pack, I gotta get to LAX. I've gotta get my stuff together! But I'm gonna see you in New York, Shane! - [Cami] Dear Shane. My favorite bar is the Crusty Cossack on Avenue of the Czars in Moscow. Meet me there tomorrow night at the Private Masquerade Ball. You must wear a mask to get in. Bring ID And come alone. I will show you everything you need to know. Cami. - It's risky sending our asset into that bar all alone without backup in a foreign country. - Chad's right. What if it's a trap? And they're using Cami's Cavern as bait? - The same bait that caused Agamemnon to launch a thousand ships. - And the war was begun. (bright music) - This is the mask you'll be wearing to the Crusty Cossack tonight. - Couldn't you have picked something a little more attractive, Mr. Ambassador? I mean it's sort of like a blind date. - Oh, I don't think it qualifies as that, do you, Gina? - I wouldn't call it a blind date. - Well, a first date at least. It's definitely that. - The Frankenstein mask has several unique features which are advantageous to our communication and surveillance embellishments. For example, in this stud-like protrusion on the right side of the face is imbedded a small camera which gives us a live video feed. And here in the left nostril is a microphone so we can hear what's going on, especially to anyone directly in front of you. - Cool. - Place this receiver bud in your left ear it will allow us to always be in communication with you. Testing, one, two, three. - Loud and clear, Boss. Heh. It's like I'm starring in my own spy novel. - Oh, but there's one more thing. Let's not forget the GPS tracking device. - Oh, right. I've had some experience with those. - Oh, no. This particular model does not go on your ankle. It's considerably more discreet. (singing in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] What can I get you? - May I have a lemonade. (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] Only the best lemonade for you, my friend. (speaks in foreign language) I trust you will find this (speaks in foreign language) better than expected. (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] Thanks. (singing in foreign language) (phone rings) - Hello? - Hey, Lover! Hey, hey, I keep trying to FaceTime you but my calls aren't going through. - I can't talk right now, Karol, I'm in the middle of something here at work. - Oh. Middle of something, yeah. Yeah, right, right. What you're in the middle of is watching some other girl's proscenium is what you're in the middle of, okay, and the thought of this is really starting to put a bug up my ass now that we're in a relationship so I, I think you should tell your Boss you wanna be transferred to a different department. - Shane, this is not the time to be talking to your girlfriend. There's important work to be done in the service of your country. - I, I mean, come on, let's face it, you know, we're talking about some major pussy fatigue here, Shane. You know, after your staring at some girl's coot-coot all day long the last thing you're gonna wanna do when you get home is pay any attention to mine and when all is said and done I'm gonna be the one that's waking the wombat. - We'll have to talk about this later, Karol. I'm sorry. What the? - Uh, I just lost picture. Shane? Can you read me? Say yes if you do. - Uh, Shane? Shane! Hello? Shane, are you there? Shane, come on, are you there? Come on! - Karol, I've gotta go. Something just came up. - So yeah, I'll, I'll bet something came up, I'll bet something came up all right. Yeah, you need to let it go back down so you can save it for me tomorrow night on New Year's Eve! (dramatic music) - The GPS tracker shows Shane has gone into the Men's Restroom. Are you having technical difficulties? - Yeah, I don't know what's going on. Shane's not responding to me so I wonder if his earbud went out too. I mean, we're still getting audio I know they're not jamming the signal. (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] I've always wanted to fuck Frankenstein. (speaks in foreign language) Ever since I saw my first monster movie. (speaks in foreign language) Please, Frankie. (speaks in foreign language) I want you to fuck me right here on the sink. (speaks in foreign language) Will you please fuck me on the sink, Franky? - Yes. (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) - [Translator] Oh yes, Frankie, I love the way you are fingering my clitoris like that. (speaks in foreign language) Oh yes, flick my little nubbin. (speaks in foreign language) Will you please fuck me on the sink, Franky? (speaks in foreign language) Oh yes, what a big monster cock you have. It's even bigger than I thought it would be. - Ooh. Sounds like our asset is seriously engaging his contact. - The live Gam Cam Grrl feed is not consistent with what we're hearing through the Frankenstein nostril microphone. - Roger that. Shane! I am sorry to inform you that the woman you are cavorting with is not Cami Fawlkes. I repeat, that is not Cami Fawlkes. - Oh! (groans) - [Translator] Oh yes, yes. Ram your big hard monster cock all the way inside me. Harder. Yes. Just like that. Fuck me harder. Yes. I want all of it. All of your big monster cock. Yes. Yes, fuck me, fuck me, give me all of it you big fucking hunk of manhood, you. Oh yes. Yes. Oh, God, yes! (moaning) Yes, give me all of it. Yes, oh, yes. Yes, yes, oh, yes, fuck me. Give me all of it you big fucking hunk of manhood, you. (farting) Could you repeat that, please? I didn't quite understand what you said. (toilet flushes) (upbeat music) - He's on the move! He's leaving the Crusty Cossack! - We're on it. (bright music) Okay, head east on Doobensky Boulevard. Step on it, they're moving really fast! I mean, I can't believe how fast they're going! Why aren't the Russian police pulling them over? - I feel so lost without my translation app. - No need to feel lost. I speak perfect English. - Oh, so all that stuff back at the bar was just? - Showtime. To throw the bloodhounds off the scent. - Are you Cami Fawlkes? - No. My name is Brin. - Pleasure meeting you, Brin. I'm Shane. - Do you really want to shake the hand that just had three fingers up your rectum? - Good point. Elbow bump, maybe? Heh? - Oh, you Americans. You always have the most peculiar customs. I love it. (bright music) - Okay, turn right on Sebrinka Street! Now right on Zbignew. They've stopped. We're closing in on the destination now which is straight ahead. Middle Ring Sewage Treatment Plant. - I'd say we've been given a bum steer. - Shit. - So what's she like, Cami Fawlkes? - Most men I encounter, including lesbians like me, consider her to be the girl of their dreams. - [Shane] Am I in heaven? - Not yet. - [Shane] Feels like I am. - You're probably still high from the ether, Darling. - Where am I? - In a safe place. Far from the prying eyes and ears of your fellow employers. - You're Cami Fawlkes. - I am. It is my deep pleasure to finally meet you, Shane. You were my hero when I was in high school. I followed your trial in the media and wrote a blog about it. I thought you should have been acquitted. I was devastated when the judge gave you 10 years. - Do you ever take off the white gloves? - Only when I'm awake. If I were to start waking the wombat in my sleep they could ID me from my fingerprints. - Smart. So you know the NSA code words. - Oh, thanks to your girlfriend posting her stand-up routines on-line. - Just so you know, they just changed all the codes. You won't be waking the wombat anymore, from now on you'll be stoking the stalactite. Oops, I shouldn't have told you that. It's classified, shh. - So what is the deal with you and Karol with a K? Are you in love with her? - Um, to be honest, the relationship hasn't really gotten off the ground yet. We still haven't gone all the way. - But you have gone down on her, which she has described in vivid detail in one of her latest videos. - I know. It's a little embarrassing. - Has she ever gone down on you? - Not yet. - See, I have found that relationships work best when there is a mutual sense of reciprocity. Otherwise they can tend to be a little too one-sided. - Yes, I, uh, you're absolutely right. Like no one wants to be in a relationship that, that's just so, oh, yes. Yeah, so, oh, too... Too, one. (moans) Sided. Hi, this is Shane. I can't come to the phone right now so please leave a message after the tone. - Hi, Shane. It's Karol. I don't know why you're not picking up your phone right now, um, but I just wanted to let you know that I booked us a hotel at the Plaza for, I got us a room for tomorrow night for New Year's Eve. You know that shit's fucking expensive, I put it on a credit card though because, whatever, you only live once, right? I decided that tomorrow night for New Year's Eve I'm gonna to do a Facebook Live feed and what I was thinking is maybe we could meet each other at the top of the Empire State Building but, um, I heard it's hard to get up there on the top of the building on New Year's Eve. So I was thinking instead we could meet at the tip of Times Square like 41st and Broadway and we're gonna meet there and surprise everyone on my Live feed because I've got like two-million Instagram followers already. But when we're done, we can go back to the Plaza and we can fuck like little bunnies on the prairie in the middle of the snow. Okay? Huh, are you down, Shane? (moaning) (bright orchestral music) - This is a project I am working on. I call it Head Room. Kind of like a gigantic iteration of the mood ring. - It's amazing. This is exactly how I feel right now. - Think of how you will feel when I give you my shadow internet technology and you get your presidential pardon. - But you're Russian, right? - Da. - Why would you give your technology to the United States? - Because right now I am on a Putin-free diet. And the U.S. is the last hope for freedom in the world. But the reason I brought you here, Shane, is I need you to help me hack The People's Bank of China. - Whoa. You think that's possible? - I have been probing their security systems for the past year and I have found a back door. But there is a firewall with an encrypted passcode that uses Chinese characters. The passcode changes every hour through a random sequence generator. I expect to transfer 32 billion yuan. That's around five billion U.S. dollars. - Billion? - Da. Billion with a B. If you help me hack I will give you 5% of the take: $250 million. - I didn't feel bad about hacking Western Ems Levee because that's where human traffickers and criminals kept their money. But the Bank of China, that's people's savings accounts. - I promise I will not touch any personal accounts. Only the big government bureaucracies and military-industrial complex. You can do what you did before with the money, Shane, and give it all to charity. Or you could start a foundation that cures diseases or does some other great good in the world. You know, people with no money, they can hope and wish and talk all they want about making the world a better place. But money is what turns those dreams into reality. - When are you planning on doing the hack? - Tonight. New Year's Eve. While everybody is partying, leaving the henhouse door open for foxes like us. Think of all the good you could do with a quarter billion dollars, Shane. - Okay. - Da? - I'm in. - Da? Oh, there is also something else that I need from you in order for the plan to work: I need you to have sexual intercourse with me at the time and the place of my choosing. No questions asked. (laughs) - What? - What is so funny about you having sex with me? - What is so funny? I wake up in bed wearing a toga with this beautiful woman who gives me head and then wants me to be on standby to have sex with her at the drop of a hat! I mean, look at all this place, is this a nut house or what? I should have known this was a wacky dream right from the get-go. - This is no dream, darling. This is as real as it gets and I need a commitment from you in order for our relationship to further: I need you to have sexual intercourse with me at the time and the place of my choosing no questions asked? I need a simple da or nyet and I need it now. - Da. - Good answer. (bright music) (dial tone rings) - [Shane] Hi, this is Shane. I can't come to the phone right now... - Pick up your goddam phone, Shane, come on, It's Karol, We're about to start taping for the show in fifteen minutes and I was just calling, you know, 'cause I just wanna hear your voice. You know, I'm, I'm nervous. You know, I was thinking this all happened so fast and I waited my whole life for this and what if they don't like me or what if, what if I think I'm good and I actually suck? You know, and I'm, I'm so alone up here. But, don't forget: tomorrow we're meeting at the corner of 42nd and Broadway, okay? Remember? Times Square? 6:45? Oh, don't forget, okay? Love you, Babe. (bright orchestral music) - The passcode for the back door uses a series of Chinese characters. So I am going to need you to drive as my wingman tonight to help me get through the final hurdle. - This Pinyin Input didn't exist back in my hey-day. I'm going to have to practice a bit to get my chops back. - We will begin the hack at 2:30 a.m. local time. That gives you 11 hours to get your fingers back in shape. - Sorry to interrupt you, Queen Camille, but are all systems still go for tonight? - All systems are still a go. - I didn't know you were a queen. - There are a lot of things you still don't know about me. But you are about to find out. Shane, this is Octavia, commander of my Praetorian Guard. - Pleased to meet you, Octavia. - I missed you yesterday. - I missed you too. - How was your day off? - Not nearly as good as my days on. - Uh, don't mind me. I'm just the Mandarin encryptionist here. - This is Shane, my new partner in crime. And my new lover. - Mm, lucky you, Shane. - Just so you know: all my bodyguards are lesbians. - Thanks for letting me know, Cami. I would have never guessed it. Not after what happened between you and me this morning. - The blowjob? - Uh, yeah. That. The blowjob. I'm sorry, but it was more than just a blowjob to me, Cami. - What was it to you then? - I don't know. A revelation? That maybe, dumb, stupid, naive Robin Hood of the Internet me fell in love with the woman whose vagina I've been staring at for the past four days. - I am the B not the L in the LGBT. Does that bother you, Shane? Who all of Karol with a K's followers know as Mr. LGBTQ? - Uh, no. - Well, then why do you sound so disappointed? - After what happened this morning and you telling me about the crush you had on me in high school, I was hoping that our relationship could be more than just a one night stand. Or one day stand, whatever. - Just because I am an openly bi-sexual woman only means that you will have a girlfriend with an added dimension. That is all. I promise you: our relationship will never, ever get boring. - We were able to retrieve the mask, his cell phone, and an old iPod that had the woman's pre-recorded voice on it. One of our IT techs is doing a voice analysis on it right now. - Hey, this thought just occurred to me, Ron: what if Shane has been in collusion with the Russians all along? You know, the Morse Code, the exchange of cutesy limericks, a Masquerade Ball in an off-beat Russian bar. - And how would they even know he had a GPS up his ass if he wasn't in on it? - Exactly. There's something about this whole gam cam affair, it just doesn't smell right. And I plan on getting to the bottom of it. (dramatic music) - We have gotten to the final firewall. Everyone please put on your masks in case of a slip up. You too, Shane. - Oh, cool. At least it's not the Frankenstein mask. This kind of impedes my vision. - You only have to wear it for a few minutes. Just for the distraction phase. Okay. Ladies and gentleman, it's showtime! If Kim Kardashian's ass can break the internet, then my vulva ought to totally obliterate it! - All right, I'd like to welcome all of you to my Facebook Live broadcast. It's almost 6:30 Eastern Time and I'm almost to the corner of 42nd and Broadway where I am about to meet my boyfriend Shane who just got back from like Who-The-Fuck-Knows-Where trying to hunt down the infamous Gam Cam Grrl. Too bad, bitch, because he's coming to see me instead. And when we get back to the hotel, I... - Alright, Mr. DeMille, I am ready for my close-up. - For you, my queen. There's a slight chance of rain. - Thank you, Octavia. - [Shane] I think I almost got this figured out. - Shane, not now. Get over here, we don't have time, we need major distraction. - Whoa! - I want you to have sexual intercourse with me. - Right, right now? In here? In front of your whole crew? Not to mention the billions of people logged on to your website. - You said I get to choose my time and place of choosing and I chose my here and I chose my now. So get to it, Shane. - Okay. Here we go, oh, I was hoping maybe we could have a candlelight dinner first? Maybe a walk on the beach? Catch a sunset? - Just shut up and fuck me, Shane. - Someone's about to go spelunking. - I said fuck me not finger me. - Sorry, old habits die hard. - Holy fuck. I just got a tweet from my BFF Lulu back in L.A. that says the Gam Cam Grrl just got a little bit of fingering action a few minutes ago and some internet trolls are saying that it's my, my boyfriend was the one doing the fingering? It's total bullshit, okay, fake news, people! Okay, because Shane's gonna be here any minute and the only fingering action that gonna be happening on this New Year's Eve is on this little piece of real estate, right there. - The internet report claims of a fingerprint match to convicted felon Shane Antar has just been confirmed by an unnamed source at the FBI This of course proves that Mr. Antar has indeed made contact with the infamous Gam Cam Grrl, Cami Fawlkes, or rather is making contact at this very moment. - What the fuck? You motherfucking son of a bitch! You fucking cheater! It's over, Shane, okay! It's over! It's O-V-E-R, over! When I get back to L.A., I'm gonna take all your shit that's in my fucking apartment and I'm gonna throw it all over the fucking sidewalk! And I'm gonna stomp on your face on the sidewalk! I'm so fuck, wait, wait, no, why, why the fuck don't I have any internet connection? What the Hell? - The internet is down. - What time zones? - Worldwide. - Masks off. Shane, get back to your station! Everybody! - [Shane] We're in! - Freeze the UTC clock. - Done. - Double-zero, double-zero, 31, automator resume. - Done. - Done. - You froze the Universal Time Clock? - For 15 minutes. Any money transfers we make during that time won't show up on their internal audits for another month and by that time the funds will be so laundered they'll never be able to follow the trail. Poof. They'll be gone without a trace. - Brilliant. - Save the accolades for the after party. Still got my east side there, Wingman? - Gotcha covered, Pilot Cami. - All right. Are we still hacked into JumboTron? - Yes, my Queen. - Put up the pre-recorded video. 'Yes, my Queen.' - Good evening to everyone around the world. My name is Cami Fawlkes. I am interrupting your New Year's Eve celebrations to bring you an important message. I hereby declare an end to patriarchal ociety that has been dominating our civilization for the past 10,000 years, and am announcing the dawn of a new age, the Age of Mutual Respect and Equality. To throw off the ropes and cast off the shackles, the mere Free The Nipple Movement is simply not enough. In order to completely free ourselves from patriarchal oppression we must free the vagina! (bright music) The method I used to create my alternate internet was based on pointillism, the same technique Georges Seurat used to create this painting. Tiny dots of color that when viewed separately are meaningless, but when viewed as a whole they create a complete picture. I created my alternate internet using the transmissions of billions of cell phones around the world. The ground zero transmitter I secretly installed at the top of Mount Elbrus. That signal was then relayed to other transponders on Annapurna Massif, Mount Fuji, Denali, Elbert, Illimani, Kilimanjaro and Puncak Jaya. The millions of cell phone bots within their range would receive the bot-dots and be re-transmitted through the app on their phones into the dark web and fed to their local internet service providers which no government was able to trace or shut down. - But how did you hijack the billions of phones around the world to make all your bot-dots? - [Announcer] Hungry Lice! - [Announcer] Level twenty-one. - Brilliant. - All the encryptions, algorithms, passwords and passcodes are here on this eight terabyte drive. Give this to the NSA and you'll receive your presidential pardon. - Thank you very much. - The U.S. Embassy is filled with cameras, so I will have Octavia drop you off a couple of blocks away. I apologize for the blindfold, darling, but there is no telling what kind of mind games those employers of yours will play in order to track my location during your de-briefing. Most of what you will tell them will be the unvarnished truth. But I will need you to sprinkle in a few little white lies for good measure. - And she never took her mask off the entire time you were there? - No. She never did. - Huh. Well, the system checks out. Including all of the codes for accessing Hungry Lice apps on people's cell phones. Reconnaissance satellite images confirm locations of mountaintop transponders, it's everything you said it would be in the de-briefing. And our field operative in Moscow managed to locate your phone. - Great. Thanks. - Don't turn it on till after you exit the building. - Got it. Just like in L.A. - I find it hard to believe that a woman that intelligent would go to so much trouble to fulfill some sexual fantasy she had in high school. - Those geniuses can do some pretty crazy stuff sometimes. Like, personally, I think it was all just a publicity stunt to bring attention to her Free the Vagina Movement. Oh, or Free the Cavern as you would say at the NSA. - I've been given authorization by the Commander in Chief to give you this upon successful completion of your mission. Thank you, Shane, for your service to your country, you've gone above and beyond the call of duty. And if you ever find yourself needing a job, the door is always open for you here. - Thank you. ♪ Why's it taken so long for my heart to get warm ♪ ♪ Like a leaf that's been torn its branch ♪ ♪ By a violent winter storm ♪ ♪ There's a light in a place we've never been ♪ - Hey. - Hi. Hi, Shane! Yeah, I'm so glad you picked up. I didn't know if you would after all the nasty things I said about you on Facebook the other night, so... - It's all water under the bridge, Karol. Let's let it slide. I'm hoping we can still be friends after this? - Yeah, me too. I started dating somebody recently. - That's a pretty quick turnaround considering you just broke up with me two days ago. So who's the lucky guy? - His name's Johnny. I just met him last week. He's my new manager. - Oh, that's great. Congratulations. Is he the one that got you the gig on Jimmy Fallon? - No, no, no, that was my agent. I've got an agent and a manager now. - Sounds like you hit the big time. - Well, I have and that's what I need to talk to you about, okay? I have a business proposition for you but, I don't wanna talk about it over the phone. - You're right. The NSA is probably listening. (chuckles) I'm on an 11:30 flight out of BWI. And it gets into Long Beach around 2:00 Pacific? - Okay, uh, then how about a late lunch at Tubulicious? Say around four-ish? - I'm there. - HBO and all the major networks are in a bidding war for this. - Yeah, they say Realitcoms are gonna be the Next big thing. - What's a Realitcom? - It's a sitcom but based on a real event. - Loosely based! - And it stars all the real people that actually lived it in their real lives. - You know, the important ones, like, you and me. - The Producers wanna start immediately. - Gam Cam Guy? That's what they're calling it? - Pretty catchy, don't ya think? - I mean, we're each gonna make 50,000 a week from this, Shane. This is it, okay? This is the next Big Thing. - I'd like to read the script first. - Okay, you can stay in here and read it and Johnny and I are gonna hop outside for a nice cigarette break. - I don't smoke. Uh, I mean, uh, yeah, why not? Let's go get some fresh air. - Excuse us. (playful music) - Boy, he really is cool as a cucumber. I mean, I thought he'd be coming in his pants when he heard 50 grand a week. - Yeah, me too, but you know, that's just his personality, so. I think he's almost done reading the script. - Ah, you know he's gonna love it. I mean, it was written by all the best writers in town. - This is the worst thing I've ever read in my life. - But what didn't you like about it? - None of these things happened anything like this. - Like I said: it's loosely based. I mean, they gotta punch up the comedy somehow. - Listen, pal, they can't do the show without you, okay, so, you know, maybe I can get ya, like, 70-grand an episode. - Please, Shane? I need you to do this for me so I don't just become another flash in the pan. - I'm sorry, Karol, but I'm not gonna spend the next three years re-living the same week of my life with a laugh track. (upbeat music) - [Woman] He looks exactly like Mr. LGBTQ. - Who? - You know, the Gam Cam Guy. - [Woman] Oh, why would he be working here? - [Woman] Uh, excuse me, could I have your autograph? - Oh, it is him! - [Woman] My cousin Barbara is such a big fan! - [Woman] Oh, my God, your performance on New Year's Eve was amazing! - [Woman] Can I have your autograph? (voices chattering) - [Man] Would you sign this for my wife? - [Woman] Lord have mercy! - [Woman] Could you sign my shopping list? - [Both] Could you sign this for me, please? - Can I have your autograph? - I'm such a huge fan. - [Both] Can I have your autograph. - [Man] You are so awesome, dude. - [Both] Could I have your autograph? - [Man] I wish I had the balls to do what you did! - [Woman] Can I have your autograph? - [Woman] Could you sign this for me? Please? - [Woman] May I have your autograph? - [Woman] Please, can I have your autograph? Please. - I wish it could have worked out, Shane. I really do. You're a good guy. You're just way too famous now. It'd be totally disruptive to our business. (somber music) (phone rings) - Hello, Shane. Is everything all right? - I've decided to take you up on your offer and work for the NSA. - Well how soon can you relocate here to Maryland? - Can't I work out here in the L.A. office? - Oh, no, we're downsizing our staff there. The only openings we have right now are here at Ft. Meade. We might have an opening in Augusta soon. - No, I can't relocate right now. My mother isn't well. Maybe when she's better in a month or so I'd consider moving. But I can't leave her right now the way she is. ♪ Train between stations ♪ ♪ No one is sure of its true destination ♪ (sobbing) - Mom, what's wrong? What's the matter? - Doctor, doctor say I have cancer. - What? - We have to sell the house for the treatments. - No, Mom, you're not gonna sell the house. I'm going to take care of you like you've always taken care of me. Okay? Okay? - Okay. Okay. Okay. (laughing) - Oh! Come off. Oh, come, uhh, my yoga pants are stuck in this thing-a-ma-jig on your leg. Can't you take it off? - No, I can't, it's part of my doctoral dissertation in Anklenomics. - Anklenomics? - It's a relatively new field. Uh, it's hard to get a scholarship in this field because, uh, nobody wants to foot the bill. (laughing) - Shane Antar? - Yes? - LAPD. You're under arrest! - For what? Telling jokes with bad punch lines? - No. Parole violation. Tampering with a GPS tracking device. - Ah, Anklenomics, my ass! - I'm sorry I lied, Karol. It was a misfired attempt at getting into your yoga pants without having to endure anymore downward-facing-dog. Brrrrrr! - Well, I mean, if you wanted to get into my yoga pants so bad, why didn't you just say so! Instead of pulling the wool over my eyes. - Can I see some ID, mam? - Anklenomics, ah! Oh, sure, I'm an ankler, I'm studying anklenomics. (laughing) Anklenomics, anklenomics! Anklenomics, who would have thought? - Hold it! - Hey! You can't go fishing in my sock drawer like that! - Why not? - Because that's where I keep my, sock puppet! (laughing) - I just doing my job. Searching for weapons. - Hey. - Hey, what's this? - That's not a weapon! That's a banana creme pie! - Hey, in the wrong hands, anything can become a weapon. - My parole officer's right. Even a banana cream pie can become weaponized. (crowd laughing) - Let's add assaulting a parole officer to that list of crimes. - Let's make that assault with a deadly weapon. - Well, I didn't know a banana cream pie could be deadly. - Well, it is if you're allergic to bananas. - Bye bye. ♪ Gam Cam, Gam Cam ♪ ♪ Gammy gam, Gam Cam Guy ♪ (upbeat music) - Is someone there? - There's a van backing into our driveway.

Be careful, Shane. - [Announcer] Hemorrhoids flaring up again, Bob? - [Bob] Yeah, no bike ride for me this weekend. - Excuse me, can I help you? - Yes, we could use a little manly help. - Indeed. - Octavia. Brin. - [Together] Happy Valentine's Day! (romantic music) - She kept her word. - Of course. - She always keeps her word. (playful music) - Where do you want these? - Let's put 'em in the garage for now. - After we're done unloading these, we'll drop you off at her new address. (upbeat music) - Did you miss me, darling? - Terribly. Happy Valentine's Day. - Oh! Oh, I love roses! You know, out of all the flowers in the world roses are my favorite. (soft music) - I was starting to think I'd never hear from you again. - No way. I would never let that happen to our love. Our love, it's just beginning. Unfolding is probably the better English word to use. Our love is one they will be writing about for ages. We will be right up there with Marc Antony and Cleopatra. With Nicholas and Alexandra. Shane and Tanya. - Tanya? - Cami Fawlkes was just my nom de guerre. My real name is Tanya Diaghileva. - Okay. Well, Tanya, thank you for keeping your promise about the money. Soon as my contract expires in May, I'm gonna quit that ridiculous Realitcom! - No! You will stay with it for all three seasons. More if the ratings are still good by then. You need to stay in the public eye, Shane. Gam Cam Guy is just a springboard for bigger and better things. This shitcom is all part of the essential plan. - I'm not robbing any more banks with you, Cami, I mean, Tanya. - Banks? Phew. Banks! We are so beyond banks, darling. We are now painting on the big canvas. The world is our oyster and with you and I as a team there is no limit as to what we can do. So here is the plan: First, we get married. Then you run for open Senate seat here in California. You will win of course because of your popularity from TV. Then you will publish a book called "Make America Rich Again, For Good." I already had a mock-up of the cover done. It will be a best seller. Yeah. Then you run for president. You will be the first Asian-American president and I will be the first openly bisexual First Lady. - A menage e trois in the Oval Office. What a concept. - Besides that, think of all of the good we could do in such a place of power. So, are you down for it, Shane? - Cami? - Tanya. - Sorry, old habits die hard. Tanya? - Da? - Will you marry me? - Da, darling. Da. - Good answer. Let's seal the deal.
