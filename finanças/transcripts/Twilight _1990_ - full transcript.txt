BUDAPEST FILMSTUDIO COMPANY, HUNGARIAN TELEVISION TWILIGHT a Gy?rgy Feh?r film Terribly sorry... for bothering you during last days of your job. I don't even know who to replace you with. Good morning, inspector! An 8-year-old girl... was found up there at the cross. She is dead some days back. - How was it done? - Razor. Did you send her any place? Did she always take the same route? The little girl was found dead in the forest. She was murdered. My child... I want to see her... My child... I want to see her... Who murdered her? Who did it? Who killed her? Who did it? - You shouldn't see her. - Who did it? Who murdered her? Who did it? Who killed her? You have to find the killer. You have to... I will... I promise. Do something! I tried. People don't listen. All is in vain. People want to get their hands this man. You found the girl? Yes, sir. You know what the people want? Yes, sir, I know. Do you know why? You've been involved in a similar case. - I'm innocent, inspector. - Oh, really.... He's not under arrest... only a witness. You are here... to keep order in the village, he is either guilty or not guilty. If free passage isn't provided, you'll be sorry. Make sure there's no hitch in the investigation. Now go outside! Send them home. What was it with Anna? Look at me. What was it with Anna? The Giant met Anna... every week. And? Look at me. - Where? - At the cross. Look at me! Sure it was the Giant's picture Anna drew? Yes. - Did you see the Giant? - No, I didn't unfortunately. Where did they meet? - At the cross. - What did the Giant give Anna? - Small hedgehogs. - Don't look away! - Small hedgehogs. He gave her small hedgehogs. - Where? - At the cross... Sure that's the Gian's picture Anna drew? CLASSROOM The professor... He doesn't give the impression of a murderer. Hadn't he been sentenced before... for an act of indecency? He had an affair with a 14-year-old girl. What about other women? He is a peddler... wandering around... in different places... What a pity he'll die... On the other hand, the child observed the car quite accurately. So accurately, I'm inclined to say that... the car might be an old fashioned one. But in this case, of course... it is just a vague assumption. If this hypothesis were true... then the killer is now... travelling from place to place... in an old fashioned car. I've found the killer on the drawing... it's just a hypothesis. It's just a hypothesis. Let's see where it'll take us. What you're trying to do is impossible... But if you now... insist on chasing a killer, who probably does not exist. And even if he exists... You will never find him. As there are too many, who fail to kill only by accident. There are too many... Well... Your predicament is alarming, I'm afraid. You said... after you rest, you went into the forest... to return to the town. You bumped into the dead body. Without even touching it. We've given you clean clothes. Can you guess why? We found bloodstains on your coat... The girl's blood were on your coat. Because I bumped into the body. Of course, you kept silent out of fear. And now you ask us to believe you again. Don't worry. We won't torture you. We're only trying to find out the truth. That's why you're here. You're our major witness. Help us. Yes, sir. Tell me, what kind of stuff do you hawk? Towels? - That too... - What else? Shoelaces... Inspector. Toothbrushes... Soap... - Shaving soap... - Is that all? All right. I think you forgot something. Tell me, what else you've got. We looked over your bags. Well? - Kitchen knives. - Continue! What else apart from that? Razor. Why were you so reluctant to admit it? The girl was killed with a razor. Look, I know you are the killer... But I also know, that you're just as shocked by what you did as we are. Something turned you into an animal. You murdered her without any reason... The urge was stronger than you, You wanted to give yourself up in the village... True? I'm tired. So are we. Get us some coffee... And two bottles of beer. For our guest, too. We are human here at the police. I'm innocent, Inspector. Yes? What did you eat that day? Stuffed chicken breast... and steamed cabbage. - You, peddlers, live well. - Anything else? Did you eat chocolate? I got the information right now. The autopsy revealed chocolate in the child's stomach. He jumped to his death. Give me this case, please. The killer isn't from here. The same guy committed the other murders too. He probably drives a car. - Maybe a traveler... - I can't allow it. You're no longer work here. You want to stick around till something happens? Something that may never happen... And you just wait and wait forever. You shouldn't have been offended. Why don't you rejoin us? You could work with us... under the same conditions. The city police might take you on again, too. You ought to consider it. For financial reasons as well. Pretty little girl... Do they know why they're here? Oh my God! I can't stand it! I'm leaving... Say something! I can't stand this any longer. You promised not to drink. You son of a bitch! You bastard! Leave me alone, you son of a bitch. You'll wake up the child. Leave me alone, you beast... You bastard... I don't want it... Leave me alone... You rotten bastard Don't do it! I don't want it... Leave me alone! I hate you... You promised that... Who gave you the chocolate? A girl. At school? Show it to me. Is there more? In your pocket? Did you get them from the magician? He said not to talk about the two of you? So don't talk. He's a nice magician of the forest. And you can see him any time you want. Let's go and play! Please, go away. Please, don't interfere with my work... Don't stand in the way... Please, go away. Don't do anything you'd regret later. Please, go away. You wouldn't leave in my place either. Both of us have the same aim. Remember our oath? It is our duty... to fight crime and to upkeep law and order. and protect the peace of the society... Who are you waiting for? Well?... Who are you waiting for? No answer? Somebody gave you chocolate... Remember? They look like small hedgehogs. You got them from a man in black coat. You must tell me who he is! Describe exactly what that man looked like! You must tell me who gave it to you! Do you understand? I just want to protect you. Stupid little child... Tell me... Who gave you the chocolate? When did it happen? Not long ago... Is he dead? He's disappeared. Was he a giant of a man in black? He was driving like he was chased. CAST: WRITTEN BY: Gy?rgy Feh?r Based on Es geschah am hellichten Tag movie script by F. D?rrenmatt
