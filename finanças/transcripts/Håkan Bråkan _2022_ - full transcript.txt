Håkan! Look out! - Yes! Come on, Beiron! - Be careful, Håkan! There's Minoacles, the moose monster. Come on! Come on, Håkan! Here's the portal! - Now we'll get him! We have to unlock the portal before the moose monster comes. Where are your crystals? - I couldn't do the side quests. Very boring. - We have a responsibility to each other. - Responsibility? I didn't know 'Beiron' means pensioner? You sound like an 80-year-old when you say that! Then we'll never finish the game. We play dead all the way to the right position Then I climb up that tower and get an overview. - Although I've got a better idea. - No, Håkan! No! Wait, come back! - Now you're gonna get it, you old moose! - No, Håkan, no! Do what I'm doing instead—play dead! - Come on then, you slimeball! I'm not scared of you! - Come on, Håkan, we have to play dead. No! Be careful, Håkan! Watch out! Håkan! We'll never have time to get good enough for this weekend's competition. - So attack next time. What good does playing dead do? - That's how you defeat the moose boss. - Crap. I have to win the competition for the game station. - Beiron, bedtime! Pause the game! - You can't pause the game. Okay, Håkan, I have to go. - Okay. Welcome to Woriyagi. What on earth is that? - First prize in a computer game competition. Okay. I don't know though, you're stuck at the computer all the time as it is. You should move into it. - That's what I was thinking. I'll start wearing nappies if I win. - No. I don't think you should. - I was joking. Yes Yes. Yes, that—I actually understood. But it's long past bedtime. Time to brush your teeth. - OK. - Nice one. Woriyagi—! Good night then, little man. - Good night. Little man. - Good night. Little men. What are you doing? We're going to— - I'm just checking the news. To see if there's any more about these burglaries. The so-called 'Wolf League' represents the worst wave of burglaries in living memory. And it's caused more and more people in Glimmerdagg to install home alarms. We urge the public to be vigilant in the future. Lock your doors. We thank the police for that appeal. Some that need to be behind a fence are the ostriches at Jansson's 4H farm. I got a tip about the Absolutely Secure alarms. I'll check them out. Stop it. You'll give the computer a bunch of viruses. - So what kind of virus? - All parents give computers viruses. - Not me. I don't know how to make a virus. - Exactly. Why don't you use the parent computer downstairs? - It doesn't work. I don't know, it looks like it's sick. - See what I mean? - But you know what? I think you've both had enough screen time for today. - What? No, please! Five more minutes! - Then I get five more minutes too! - No, it's bedtime. I want a night-time snack. I'll go and microwave a potato. - Håkan! - I'll have cheese and crackers. - Håkan! - And wine. Red. You have five minutes, darling. Five minutes. Håkan? Ronny, down off the wall bars! Give me the ball! Thanks for that. Good job, good job. Sit down! Now we're all sitting down, we have a lot to get through before dodgeball. So we'll jump straight to the student council election. We need a school representative— - I saw you failed miserably when you played Woriyagi. Beiron, let me know when you want to play with a winner instead. - Beiron, don't even listen. Don't even look. - If you'd listened once, you wouldn't have failed so miserably. - What're you talking about? I'm all ears! - Sure. Ronny! Håkan! - Are you mad? What're you doing? - Maybe I am, but are you even listening? - Yes, we're listening. - Good. Because it's now exactly level in the election to— - exactly level? What election? - Election to the student council. The student council is a great thing. - The student council? That's when you become an adult. Responsibility and shit. - Exactly. And it's just you and Ronny left to choose between. - It's a lot of responsibility and I think you guys are mature— - Stop! I vote for Ronny! - And I vote for Håkan. A little bit of commitment. That's exactly what democracy is. Things are starting to happen here. 8-8. It's still even between Ronny and Håkan. How do we solve this? - We can play for it. - At dodgeball now? It's the Woriyagi competition this weekend. Whoever wins gets to choose who joins the student council. - I don't care about computers and that stuff. Decide by Monday. That'll do for me. - Deal? - Deal. - Who's ready for some dodgeball? - What was that for! - Come on! - We have to win the competition this weekend. - Then you have to do the side quests. - I know. But pep it up a bit. - Okay. - Good luck, Håkan Tråkan. It'll be fun to see you here later. 'Rudolf Andersson'? - Dad. - Oh shit. The student council really sucks. Håkan. Come on. Look at me. Life's turned out pretty well for me, hasn't it? I was a member of the student council when I was little, several years in a row. - I know. Hence the stress. Stop it. That was one of the best and most enjoyable experiences of my whole life. It has shaped me into who I am. I think it would be good for you. Mum says you lost your hair in third grade. I have a strong suspicion as to why. And I like my hair. - It's super nice. And where is everyone? Where are Sune and Anna? - I have no idea. - Don't you know where your own children are? - Yes, of course I do. Sune is— - Sune is at riding camp with Sophie. Anna is with her boyfriend. - Of course. - And I've now installed the alarm. - And she's now installed the alarm. All right? Soon there'll be dinners for two and weddings. Then you become a grandfather. - Grandfather. - Suits your style. Yes. Wait, what? No. Style? What do you mean? You haven't put away your plate. Or put the rubbish out. I've told you about that several times, but you never seem to listen, Håkan. - Oh I do. Besides, it's a ramp and a jump. I have to get playing. It's urgent. No, what's urgent is for you to pack your case. Because we're going. - Going where? - To Aron Sandmén's summer cottage. - Summer cottage? I can't play in a summer cottage. - You don't have to worry about that, because you're not going. It's some kind of babysitting— Karin, isn't there a babysitter or something? - I want to stay at home by myself. You're not allowed to stay by yourself. Especially now with a gang of burglars running riot around here. - But the babysitter's coming here, right? - Yes. Or—No, I don't know. Karin! Was it Aron's daughter who was supposed to babysit? - What?! - Aron's daughter Amanda is looking after you. Get in the car. I'm just going to change. - You heard that. Amanda Sandmén's your babysitter. I've been saying that all along, but you don't listen. - All right, Håkan? Belt on? - Yes. Amanda Sand— - Håkan! - What are you doing, Dad? You have to pick up your junk! Your skateboard and all your shit! - It's a ramp! - No, it's junk! There! Are you happy now? - No, I'm not happy, you've broken them. Have you any idea what these cost? - No, I don't know. - Then I'll tell you. An arm and a leg, Håkan! - I'm a kid. How do I know what an arm and a leg cost? - There. Locked and alarmed. - Are you wearing Anna's clothes? - Yeah. I—I'm borrowing them. I'm going to talk to the people tonight about mine and Aaron's app. I think this lends some credibility. Dress for the occasion, heard of that? Maybe I should have got Sune's clothes. Then we'd have matched a little better. - It's not fancy dress, Rudolf. - No, it isn't. Glimmerdagg Police. - Police? - Yes, hello, Aunt Gunnarsson. - A tyre just rolled past me and the dogs. - Okay, but we're just about to have hot dogs here. - Yes, but please. I just want to report this. It's strange, the whole thing. - We'll check it, Aunt Gunnarsson. - Yes. Thanks. Yes! I knew it! Amanda is GAME-anda! Who's—? Yes, it was fun. That's great, isn't it? I bet she's fixed up the wifi and the games computer for me. - That'll be fun. - Oh, that pinging! It's driving me crazy. Put the phone away, baby. How's it going? - Double-checking alarm. And something important. GAME-anda's my babysitter! We'll easily win now! I'm not addicted to the phone. - That's what an addict would say. - What does someone who isn't an addict say? - You don't say anything. Then you're not an addict. - But I'm not an addict. Okay? - Then you'll have to prove it. Put the phone away. Tonight. Ronny Level ... Accelerate! Ronny Level ... Accelerate! Yes, absolutely, let's do it. From now on. - Yes, from now on. - Just gonna— I'm on my way. - Put it away. - Yeah. - No problem. - No. Great. - Yes? Did you want something special? - No. Looks like it's going to be a pretty quiet evening. - For goodness' sake, Stefan, calm— - Basket— ball! Well! Is this Håkan? - GAME-anda! Where's the computer? I have to play. GAME-anda? That's a name I haven't heard in quite a while. - Aron, nice to see you. Been a long time! - Hi! - Wow, what a fancy car! Oh my God. How much does one like this cost? - Well, it costs— - Rudolf! No. - You don't have to answer. It can be a bit sensitive to talk about money. It's not just me wondering. Håkan. Weren't you wondering what it cost? - No. - No? I must have misunderstood. - We don't need this any longer. Amanda's got her driving licence now, hasn't she, honey? - Congratulations. - Thanks. - I have a driving licence too. I got mine 30 years ago. - Håkan's asking if you have a computer. - Mum, of course she has. She's one of the best Woriyagi players in the world. - Yes, Wori—what? - That game I usually play. - Is that so? No, what fun! - Here are his things. - I'll sort that out. I'll take them in. - Håkan, wait, wait. It's like this. Amanda's being very kind and helping us. It's important that you don't mess around. You have a history of being a little rough with babysitters. It's not my fault the babysitters can't cope. - Well maybe it's a little bit your fault for putting potatoes in odd places where they shouldnt be. - Ah! Absolutely Secure. Yes, we have that in the house too. Karin bought it and installed it. Our neighbour has it as well. It's good stuff. We do have good stuff. In my time we didn't have alarms. When I was little. When we were small. - Now it's important that you do exactly as Amanda says all the time. Otherwise, there'll be no screentime for two weeks. I might even sell your computer. Or rent it out maybe. Okay? Understood? - Okay. - Have fun. - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - So we're off to the little cabin. - No, no, no, don't hang! - Aren't we taking your car? - No, it's freshly waxed. It's not running today. It's not the big income, but the small expenses. Right, Mr accountant? - Easy to say when you have a big income. - We're happy to drive. - I'll have to fill up again. My back! Okay. Where's the supercomputer? - I don't have a supercomputer. - What d'you mean no computer? You are GAME-anda! - Stop calling me GAME-anda. I don't even play any more. - What? So—what, you don't play any more? - Yeah. I don't play Woriyagi any more. OK? - Why? You were the best! - I'm not a child any more. - Yeah but—when did you get old and boring? - I have a party to plan. - For us? When we've won the game? - What? No. - What do you mean no? - Oh hi, Pontus. No, that wasn't for you, just some kid. Fuck it. Have you fixed everything? - Everything's fixed here. So now all that's left is the party, so to speak. - What d'you mean? You were thinking of coming? - Yes— Why shouldn't I? - Yeah, but you're kind of old. - Listen you, I'm not old. I'm not old. I'm young at heart. So—and how else did you think Theo was going to get there? - Wha—Theo's coming? - Yes. Or at least I can arrange it. - If you want. - Yes. Deal. - Deal. - Right. Bye. No! Who's Theo? - A guy in my class. And he's new, really nice. Why do you care? OK. Listen, here's the deal. Not being nasty, but I didn't want to babysit you. No one else was available. They wouldn't have gone to the cabin and I wouldn't have been able to have the party— No party, no Theo. You with me? - Yes, but I have to play. I can't go to your party. - You're not supposed to go to the party, understand? You'll get a computer. - I thought you didn't have a computer. Dad has one. Happy? - No. A parent computer. OK, so the entire council's been invited. Everyone liked your idea, Karin. - Did they really? - Babblan. The library as an audio book app. Genius! - They don't call me BookKarin for nothing. - But the point is, an app needs resources. So we need top funding. - Top funding. - That's why I've invited a successful investor to the cottage later. - Today? - Yep. - Okay, so who is it? - He's not the usual type. Likes retreats and yoga, a bit weird. - I've actually done some yoga. I did pregnancy yoga with Anna. With my legs over my head on the floor. - Yes, you have to impress him tonight. That'll be your job. - OK. - I'm serious, Karin. In the worst case, we'd have to shut down the Babblan project— and the library. But don't think about that. Now we're going to have fun! - It'll be fine, Karin. You know about technology and apps and stuff like that. - I do. - Yes, exactly. What kind of house is that? A summer cottage? It's bigger than his house in town. What was he doing in Tokyo? Selling guns? - He was a stockbroker. - Same thing. - Rudolf, you keep a low profile today. I'll do the talking. - I always keep a low profile. Should we— - Yes, take everything in. I have a little back pain, but— Are you kidding? That's not a real computer. It's a giant toaster. With a screen. - It's dad's old one. It'll do. - For what? Making people feel bad, right? - But it'll do. - A parent computer full of viruses. - You're probably full of viruses. - Maybe I'll make a call and tell them someone's having a little party. - Know what? Maybe I'll make a call too and tell them how difficult you're being. Then you'll get a computer ban. Exactly. I heard what your mother said. So it's probably best that we cooperate. - Whatever you might think, this fight isn't over. I— - Sure, keep fighting. You can start by taking the computer up to your room. Yeah yeah! Someone's coming. Now someone's coming. - Hello. - We didn't think anyone was at home today. - Well, there is. - Oh OK. - Are you here to fix the toaster? The computer, I mean. - Oh. Another one. - Two. - No, we're from Absolutely Secure. We drive around checking to make sure everything's secure. Absolutely secure. - Isn't that what the alarm's for? - Exactly. We are—or at least you are— - At home. - You, customers—first— - Premium customers. - Precisely. - With us. - Is your name Johanna? - Yes. Problem with that? It's 2022. I thought I was free of prejudice now. Yeah, but what I mean is, you're both called that. Yes, although we—swapped badges earlier. - Na. So, my name is Johan. Na is the last name. Nothing strange at all. There was a manufacturing error. Although his name is Johanna. And Na is his last name. Johanna Na. And my name is Johan Na. It's a common name people can have. Like Beyoncé and Spider-Man. Those are just common names. Is it strange to have a name? Is having a name unusual? - But you still have the same name. - Yes, we're siblings. - We wanted to check that everything is okay. Thank you, Spider-Man and Beyoncé. I'm a little busy. - Spider-Man and Beyoncé? Are you stupid? - I panicked! - Calm down now. I didn't know they were at home. According to the logs they should have left. - Check the cameras next time. Well, we'll wait a bit. - Yeah, we can get something to eat while we wait. Hungry? - Yes, I am. - Great. I'll sort it. Hello, Siris. Show the way to a hamburger restaurant with really good price. - Call the police. - No. No, dammit! - Maniac! Fucking workers! - What are you doing? Come on. Come on now! Can't you tell us a little more about the investor? - Chrille? He created a card game as a youngster. Then it became an app and a game on PS Box or whatever it is now. - Computer games, video games, stuff like that? - It's called Wariyakiya. Or was. I don't know, something like that. He sold the whole thing and became a billionaire. - Rudolf! What's the name of the game Håkan's always playing? - Warrior—Jackie—or something. I don't know. Why do you ask? - I think maybe the investor invented Håkan's game. I need to google. - Okay. Just say the magic words. - Which are? - 'You were right, Rudolf. I am addicted to my mobile. I can't do without it'. 'You're handsome too.' - A lot of magic words. - Hey, Rudolf? Can you get some ice too? Arigato. Brilliant. - What's he doing? Do I work for him now, or what? Am I supposed to be his personal geisha? - You'd like to do that, would you? - Be a geisha? - Yeah. You'd be so cute as a geisha. It's vital that this audio book app comes off. You know. No Babblan— - No library, I know. I'll do it. I do it. - Great, OK. - I'm going to get some ice now, Aron-san. - Low profile. What's it called now? Woorio wa? Woriwahoo? Beiron, I'm here! - Where's GAME-anda? - She's got old and boring. Doesn't play any more. - We'll have to do without her. Come on, we have to run side missions. - What is it? - You seem to have frozen. - OK. Am I moving now? - Kind of. Or maybe not. - What if I do this? - Now, I think— Or not— -Sorry, my ping is the worst. I'll have to ask people to get off the wifi. - Which ones? - There's a hundred pensioners having a party here. - Ronny's approaching the top. He's winning. - Stop stressing me out. I'll solve it. - Is that the toilet? I need to pee. - What are you talking about? I'm playing! - Playing in the toilet? - No! Get off the wifi, please! Yes—Do you like cars? - Yes— - Yeah, I have a Volvo. 250 horsepower. - Aren't you like 30? 20 plus. Are you on wifi? - Yeah. - Can you get off it? - No. - Don't you understand? Get off Wi-Fi! - Cutie! Don't you understand? It's really slow for me. - Little guy, I really need to pee! What do you want from me?! - Hello, Pontus. Where's Theo? - He's coming. What a nice party. - You promised. - Just—take it easy. He'll be here any moment. Look, I—have to go to the loo. Do you have one of those? - Yes. No shit. There. - Yes, it's pressing. Oh my God! What the hell? Håkan? Håkan! Don't you dare! Damn kid! What are you thinking with! - My brain! I need wifi. So everyone has to leave. No drinking, no old people freeloading on wifi. - You go up to your room right now! - No! You're not my mother! Stop telling me what to do! - Yes, Håkan! Tonight I am actually your mother! - Mum? - Oh. Theo— - When did this happen? - He's not my son, he's— - I'm not judging, but a child's a pretty big deal and I don't know if I'm ready— If you're my mother, you need to fix a proper connection for me. - You are the world's worst mother! - I'm just a babysitter. It's your own fault. Watch TV. That's what I did when I was little. And don't call me Mum again! Okay? - Are you having a good time? - Yes, yes. A tip. I wouldn't go into the loo now if I were you. - Thanks. - I was going to ask— Is it true what they're saying? You have a child? - No, it isn't. And you need to sort out more drinks. We're completely out. - Already? How—? - Yes, we're out. Deal with it! The ostrich's food consists mainly of plants and insects. But a hungry ostrich won't refuse nutritious food. Where are you? The ostrich's closest relative is the dinosaur. I can't play. When the ostrich itself is prey and feels threatened Ronny's gonna win! that's when it sticks its head in the sand. - It's a kind of defence mechanism. - I'm not an ostrich. The bed! Cosplay stuff? Shit. What's this? Amanda's gaming book? This is how you defeat Minoacles. Become the best at Woriyagi. Here—Username: GAME4NDA. Password: 6YTO. Sexy Theo? We'll have this. Perfect landing spot. Yes, well, it's me again. They need more to drink here. Yes, I don't know. Three more cans. What are you doing? - I'm actually trying to aim for the pool. Put me down! A tip. Stop picking up little girls. You can't jump from there. Stop! Wait, hello! Shit. I really have to go home and play. Yes! Here, here, here, here! Ronny's at level 34. It's time we caught up. Or are you interested in the student council? - Ha ha, very funny. I'm going as fast as I can, believe me. It's been going pretty well for me, hasn't it? I don't want to be like dad. He loves surprises. Can appear anywhere. - Here I am with some ice. - Oh good. Pop some champagne there, please. That's lovely. - What fun. Thank you, Master. - Rudolf! - Where the hell is Chrille, then? Fine folk always arrive late, but— - Yes. Could that be him? - Now! Come on, everyone! Can you see? Is that him? - Pop some champagne. Little geisha— - It's him. - Hello, hello! - Thanks for the applause. Thank you, thank you. That's Christian. - Yes. What are they staring at now? Christian, you are sick! What's happening tonight? - Damn cork... - Christian? Chrille! - What are you doing? - What? What are you saying? - This isn't keeping a low profile. - What? - It's high profile. - I've got water in my ears. I have half the pool in my ears! Oh God! - No thanks. I don't drink alcohol. Just soothing rooibos tea. Body temperature. - I don't ask for much— Go inside, get changed. Stay out of the way. - We drank a lot of tea in Japan. Karin, can you check the cupboard there? - Yeah, I'll deal with it. - What an uphill climb. - Yes. - You do have a plan, don't you? - Yes. God, I'm so well prepared. What are you doing? Take that off. The whole point of this Absolutely Secure thing is— to avoid being out at night, to avoid wearing the wolf masks. - I was freezing. - What are you doing? - See that? It's a real gem, this one. - Go and hang it up again. - You know what people are saying? - No. What are people saying? - The awning is the saffron of the house. - No. Nobody's saying the awning is the saffron of the house. Nobody. - What shapes. - Listen to me instead. We have to ignore priority one now. - Yes, but look. What about the bitch with the art collection? - Gunnarsson? Looks good. Logs say she's out with her dogs every hour. - And on the same street, the Anderssons? They've got a new alarm. We can go and take a look at their awnings. - Enough with your awnings fetish! We're going back to leave this stuff at headquarters. Then we go to Gunnarsson's and get her paintings. Paintings. Focus on paintings. Woriyagi is a mix of— Think Shadow of the Colossus meets Zelda. Do you play video games? - No ... - OK. AR, AI, VR. Are these terms familiar? No? Okay, I'll try to explain. Woriyagi is thus a game of levels. - What are you wearing? I need the keys. - Aaron's dad's—stuff. - Yeah. I need the keys. The car keys. I have to call Håkan. - What? Is this phone withdrawal? - No it isn't. - Take it easy. Just mingle and have fun. I'll text Amanda. I'll fix it. - Where are you going? You can't leave Chrille all by himself. - Give me five minutes. I have a plan. - It fits. - Yes. I'm going to text. - Hello? - Hey, little man. What are you up to? - Nothing. Just chilling. I don't want to disturb Amanda. Well-behaved, you know. - So amazingly good. Can you tell us a little bit about this Woriyagi? - Okay. Why? You never cared before about Woriyagi. - I'm a cool Mum who wants to learn about cool stuff— You know what? Double pocket money if you do. - Damn! - What? - No, nothing. I mean 'damn good deal'. What do you want to know? - Everything. But quickly. - Great party. - Yes. Thanks. Håkan? Do you want to come and dance? Håkan? Håkan?! Where the hell is he?! Everything all right? Everything's great. Shit! Dummy! A dummy! No one's gonna believe this. - Where did you go? - Shit! Oh, hi. I just needed some air. - What happened here? - No, look—it's not mine, it's my son's. The one who's lying about being my son. Amanda, what are you talking about? He's run off! - You've lost your son? - He's not my son! - Where is he then? - Well I don't know! He's just gone! I'm the world's worst babysitter and the world's worst party fixer. But you can't go, OK? You don't care about your child? - I'll sort this. It'll be the best party ever! - But what about your child? - He's not my child! - I don't give a shit—about some damn party. Oh good. I thought he'd be homesick. - Homesick? He's gone home. Okay, the werewolves are minions, side quests give XP. You have to acquire inventory in the form of weapons and armour. The portal has runes that are a puzzle to help you defeat the final boss Minoucles— - Minoacles. - Minoacles. Minoacles! He's a moose minotaur who enslaved all the animals of the forest. They have to be freed. All right then? - Yes. Kiss, bye! Uh, kiss. Shit. No! No! No! Hello? Hi Beiron. I can't get into the house. The door is locked with an app. OK wait. Haven't you got your mother's mobile ID on your phone? - Yes? - Then you can download the same apps. - Smart! - Yes I know. Police? I want to report a killer lawnmower running amok on Trollvägen. Thanks. - I'm inside. - Come on, get into the game now! 6YTO. Thank you, Amanda. Here we go. - GAME-anda? What are you doing here? - It's me, Håkan. Come on! Now we'll get them! Hang on, Håkan! How did you get GAME-anda's skin, armour and sword? I found GAME-anda's gaming book with tricks, codes, passwords, users. - I looted her stuff too. - You stole it? That's cheating! - No. I'm borrowing it. It's only cheating if anyone notices. - Watch out! Play dead! - I don't think so. - Yes! Towards the portal! Victory is ours! - Towards the portal! Wait, I have to check something. - Håkan? - Speak of the devil—and he appears. - Don't you have a party to go to? - And a child to look after. Open it! - Let me think— - No! - I'm really not lying. I'm not. - I believe you, Mrs. Gunnarsson. But what is it you want to report? - Now they're at it again. - Who? - The Robber League. - Thieves? - Exactly. Thieves. - Not robotic lawnmowers or car tyres? - Quiet! - Now they're going round the back. - Round the back? What're they going to do there? - Now she's climbing the wall. - The robotic lawnmower or the car tyre? - A thief, I told you! - What the hell? Now Gunnarsson's back too. What the hell's she doing now? Have a look. Check if anyone else is committing burglaries? - Yes, it looks like it. Follow the law, so to speak. Follow the law. - We have to check out our competitors, I think. - Yes, let's do that. - Get out of here! What are you doing? I'm about to win the contest! Don't you understand? - You're my responsibility and you're coming home with me. Don't you understand?. - I have to play. - Yeah, but we don't have time to play. Hello? We're here from Absolutely Secure. Completely secure. We are absolutely certainly from Absolutely Secure. - I turned off the alarm. - Obviously not. Dammit. - They'll tell our parents if they see us. - I know. Get your jacket. Let's go. We'll have to sneak out. Hurry up! - I have to get the potato. - Never mind the potato! - I have to have my potato. Be someone completely different. Kind of like minions who are werewolves. Some bosses are real Minoacles. - Yes, the super boss in Woriyagi. - Precisely, exactly. Mean, domineering. Exactly! She's got it. Is there any more tea? - Yes. Aron, could you make some more tea? Then you might get some XP. It's a great thing. You really want that. You really want XP. - Look, a computer! We'll take it. - No, it's a parent computer. Full of viruses. It's pure rubbish. Let's spread out. Put on the earphone. - I zoomed out, sorry. What did you say? - Put on the earphone. - Can you hear me? One two. Do you hear? - I'm standing next to you, you idiot. - Let's check the ground floor first. - Yes, yes, you were right next to me. - Parent computer— - There's nothing there. Stop dazzling me! I'll go upstairs and take a look. You keep watch here. - Yes, yes. They've probably already left. There's nothing of value left here. What the hell? A CRT TV? That's quite a thing. I didn't think they really existed. - So—gamer-Karin, then? - Oh yes. Definitely. - And otherwise? Villa, Volvo, doggy? Children? No. I don't have time for everything. Working at the library, playing a lot— computer—or video games and all that. So. And speaking of the library, we're currently developing a very exciting app. We're actually looking for investors. We think it would be great fun to play together in the same half of the pitch, so to speak. The app's called Babblan and we think it'll take the library to the next level. Otherwise it'll be game over. Isn't the champagne cork sniper over there with you? Rudolf? No no no. No absolutely not. He's—Dad - Dad? Your Dad? That's lovely! There you see? Isn't it nice to bring your old Dad to a party. - Yeah, certainly is. No, dammit! Put it back! It's a kettlebell with an antenna. Look at this! A gaming computer. That'll bring us some cash. Come on! - I'm just going to check the awnings. - No, dammit! We're leaving now. - Stop dazzling me! - Yes, yes. - Let's go! - Sh! - I'm just trying to be a little polite. - They've got my computer! Amanda, let go! - Listen! You can't talk to them. Then they'll tell our parents. - Why's the security company taking my computer? - There must be a reasonable explanation. I don't know. Listen, let's do it this way. Call our parents from a hidden number then— ... we head back to the office. Something's not right here. There are thieves about. - Damn all thieves. But we can call the police. - Calling the police. - Quiet! Pull yourself together! - Pull yourself together, Siris. Quiet! - Calling the police. - Don't call! Don't call! He's got to be kidding! Hello, Papi! What an adorable daughter you have. Nice girl bringing her old Dad to parties. - I can't hear anything. I've got water in— - Yes, you can't hear. You can't hear. - OK, Karin Okay, time for the coup de grace, eh? Money, money, money! - Yes, yes. But I think Christian needs to have some fun so he can relax. - OK, no offence, but then maybe he shouldn't be talking to old Rudolf. - You know, I had the same problem once. In Peru. A horny old male llama spat in my ear. Yes, it took three weeks before I could hear with that ear again. - What's up with him today? - What? He's tired, I think. I'll sort it. Come on, it's—what's it called—? Pool party. Oh, there's a pool party? Shouldn't Papi be included? - No, he's already had a bath today. - Where—where are you going? - Have you talked to Amanda? - Amanda! The children. - Yes. She's sent a text message here. They're playing, I think. At least I think so. - Are you all right? - Yes, until you got in the way. Why? - Are you going to jump in, or what? - Yes, if you take me to get back my computer first. I have to play. Or else I end up on the student council. - What are you doing? - Saving my future! - So what about mine? - Yours is already lost. You're already boring. - Yes. OK. Jump in then. We'll pick up your shitty computer. Quick, before I change my mind. Amanda, quick! Someone's crashed! - Oh, shit! - Finally. What happened? - I'm calling 112. - Breathe. Take it easy. - Please— SOS Emergency, what has happened? Hello. There's been an accident near— the 5G mast at some leisure area. Send an ambulance and all that. - Okay. Is anyone hurt? - A guy who drove into the mast. - Give me the phone! We're innocent young people, OK? Just get here, over and out! - Just take it easy. Help is on the way. OK? - We really do deserve this. - Hey! Accident up at the 5G mast. We have to take it at once. Hurry up. Come on! Where are you? Is the party over or what? Shit, Theo! Håkan, We have to go to the party. - No! We have to get my computer! Okay? I'll fix the party if you help me. - How? - I know a guy. - Hello. Im here to get the party moving. - What do you mean? - Party, party. - You'll fix this, Beiron. Make sure you get some good moves going. I don't know how to make good moves. I've never even been to a party. - What about all those kids' parties? What did you do then? - Hide and seek. - Would hide and seek work? - No! Theo's not a child. You could have said your so-called fixer was eight years old. - OK, Beiron, you'll fix it. - OK. - There must be a toilet. - I think there's one that way. - Thanks. - But what's he actually doing? - It's fine. Come on now. Let's get the computer. - Yes, but wait. Wait. It's really weird— Håkan! - Hello? - Hello, Johanna. I need help. - Who's Johanna? So—what kind of help? - I want my computer back. - Computer? What kind of computer? - It's my cat. - Okay. - What's it called? - Johanna. - She's called Johanna too? - Yes. She is. - Håkan! Come on! - So what about your computer? - No, it was a joke. I was just kidding. A prank. Bye! - Who was it? - The Sandmén kid. - Yeah? Did he notice anything? - No. I don't think so. He wanted his computer. - I've been thinking. I'm crazy, but I've been thinking. What if the wall-climber girl and the Sandmén kid are the other thieves. - No, they're just kids. - Are they really? One could be an adult and the other one a dwarf. - No, you can't say that, it's called 'short stature'. - Yeah. If they're kids, they're child criminals. They've been fooling us all evening. - He said he was pranking me. - Oh my God! - I knew it. They're the thieves! - Yes. No shit, Sherlock. We have to call the police. - Then everything'll be ruined. We can tell the police later. My computer's our priority. - How can you call that our priority? We have to call the police, Håkan. It's—Håkan! - Staff party? - Pull yourself together. Or—hand sanitizer. - I apologize for my colleague. He's hungry. Yeah—? - So come on then! - Can you please just listen to me? - As I suspected. They entered from the back. So. Thieves. - Yes, I know, but Håkan, well— I'm the world's worst babysitter. - Håkan. Come on. - Yes! The computer. Håkan. The Wolf Thieves. They're the ones. - Have you fed the hostages? - No. Did you put the tuna in the car? Typical. - Typical? Is that all you have to say? We are stuck in a wolf's den. Literally! Shit. Now dad's calling. We have to get out of here. Now. - Okay. Amanda here. Leave a message after the beep. - Hey sweetie! Dad—just wanted to see how you're doing. I received a notice that my car is illegaly parked at the port. It's probably a mistake, but can you check the garage is locked. Thanks sweetie, kiss! Woriyagi! - So. The Babblan app—what do you say? - We'll talk about it later. - The last wire, eh? Great. Then we'll be done soon. - God, what a night. Let's go back to the hot dog stand and grab that sausage, shall we? Why does everything have to be against me all the time? If you'd only let me play— - Then you'd've been robbed and murdered. Show some gratitude. - Do it yourself. My pal Beiron's fixing your party. - Great. - No signal! - Do you have a signal? - No, do you have a signal? No. It's easy, let's get out of here. - But—please. Before you go maybe I can tempt you with a drink? - So what kind of drink? Juice, right? - No. Wine. - So what kind of wine? The off-licence is closed. - Party, party. It'll be great. I'm almost done. At least 12%. - Is everyone's glass filled now? - Yes. - What's this? Did I tread this? - Nice try, man. - Wait, don't go. Wait! Sorry for this shit. Can we play hide and seek instead? - Seriously? Come on. You need the nutrition, you know. And yeah, we can grab one for Mum too. - What the hell! Now the mini thieves have taken the luxury car from Sandméns as well. - They're professionals. Real thoroughbred professionals. We have to get the paintings from Gunnarsson before they get ahead. - She'll be out with the dogs soon. - I don't understand how they do it. Are you bugged? - What d'you mean? - Are you bugged? No, I was just thinking— Do you have a mic on you? Are you a cop asshole? Bastard? - When would I have had time to become a cop, you idiot? Now we're going to Gunnarsson's before the mini thieves nick everything in town. - I just want to be on my guard. Do stop sulking now, Johanna. Tuna! It's so good. - Get a move on! - I'm coming, I'm coming! - So, Christian, how about investing in our audio book app? Babblan. It naturally supplements the regular business— - Here comes Minoacles! Tickle-tickle-tickle! - Oh god, sorry. What— - I can't call any more. Have you tried calling Håkan recently? - I don't have a mobile phone. Rudolf's keeping an eye on things. I don't think so. - What? What happened here? - I'm ticklish. Sorry. Where's Rudolf? Rudolf? Rudolf? Wake up! I have to see the picture Amanda sent of Håkan. - Okay, okay. - Can you hurry? - Yes. I'm just trying to keep a low profile. - It's a dummy Rudolf. It's a dummy. Haven't you looked at it? - Yes, but it's these glasses, Karin, I— - Why haven't you reacted? It's a dummy! - They're completely— - My car's gone! Amanda's alone! What if the Wolf League is there too! - We have to leave. We have to go! - Yes. But we've been drinking. - What about him? - Yes, you. You were only drinking tea. You can drive us. - Me? - Yes, you, Mr. Woriyagi. My child may be in danger. - You told me you don't have any children. - I have three children! I lied! Sue me! Will you wipe your nose and get in the car. Fast! - Is the children's grandfather going to join us? Give it here! Can't you see I'm in pain? Hang on, grandfather? Wait for me! When you want to call, it doesn't work. - So we focus on the paintings now! - Shit, they're coming! No awnings! - OK. Paintings! To Gunnarssons. - Yes. Let's go. Feels pretty good. We dash in— - Grab the paintings— Maybe an awning— - No! Just focus on paintings. I don't want to hear any more now. - There's something wrong with you. - Pull it down. Answer me, Håkan. Why didn't you say you're married to your Dad? - Dad? What are you talking about? - It was nothing. I didn't know you'd turn into a touchy-feely old moose. Sorry about that, but I thought— Yeah, you know. - If I'd only been allowed to take my phone, I'd have noticed something was wrong. - You only had to say the magic words, Karin. And what's all this about moose? - Christian, watch out! What was that? - I couldn't see very well, but I think it was an ostrich. - What? - An ostrich. Yes. This is probably the reason for the trouble with the network. - God, the traffic's terrible here. I'll take it. It's a total shutdown here, so please wait in the car until we've secured the area. There are ostriches loose! Crap everywhere! And I haven't been allowed to eat! - But we have to get through. Our children may be in danger. - I'm sorry, but the road is closed. There's a 5G mast fallen over. We're working as hard as we can. So sit in the car and wait. - Exactly. Is there blood? Was there an assault? - No no. - I don't have time for that. - It's just stress. - Stress. - We need reinforcements here. In and out. Focus on the paintings. Paintings. - Yes. Hey! What are you doing? - I've got my computer and I'm going home to play. - You're kidding? They're breaking into your neighbour's. - Catching thieves is not part of my weekend plans. I'm a kid. You're the most grown-up and boring, Amanda. You go and catch them. - No, Håkan— - No! Don't keep saying Håkan! I'll age as fast as you, then I'll join the student council— and I'll end up working at the Swedish Tax Agency like my Dad. - Yes, but what's really your problem, Håkan? - I don't want to be like—like you. - I'm not even that old. - No, but where did GAME-anda go? The one who was the best at Woriyagi? Well? Where did she go? - I don't know. But I'm not a kid any more, Håkan. And Theo doesn't want a nerd. - What are you doing? Hurry up! Drop it! - It's a great awning. I'm not leaving it here. I won't do it. - Put the awning down. Put it down now! - A handy little awning never goes wrong. It's a terrace awning. - Okay, one awning. Never again. OK? - Absolutely. - You say that every time. - Is that the dwarf over there? - Please, you say 'short stature'. - But it's him, isn't it? Yes. Creep forward, then pick him up. Bish bash, just like that. - No, we call the police, tell them about the break-ins, then the mini-thieves get the blame. - You know what? You're smart. - Thanks. I know. Jackpot. There's no one in at Sandméns. - Let's go there straight away. - Good, good. You haven't put away your plate or put the rubbish out I've told you about that several times, but you never seem to listen, Håkan. What's really your problem? - But if you had listened for once, it wouldn't have gone wrong— - Håkan! - My art! My paintings! The subscriber you are trying to— My mobility—scooter— - This feels good. Doesn't it? - A top crime. They are so going to pay for this! Do we know how many ostriches escaped? - Calm down, Karin. - Sorry, Karin. I put so much pressure on you. What good is it if Amanda's in danger? And of course the fate of the library is in our hands, not—not in yours. - Yeah— - And I— Sorry—Christian, was it, yeah? That I—shot you—in the balls— with that champagne cork. Good grief, you just don't do that. - No, it—Sorry. - You just don't do that at all. - But I didn't mean to. I really didn't. - No. - Although it was a good shot. - This isn't the time to brag. - No. It's not bragging. It was from a long way off— - OK, OK, fine. Can we start thinking about something else now? - Yes. Absolutely. Concentrate. How do we solve this? - OK. Focus. How do we get to the children? Amanda? Where are you? - You came! - Yes of course. - I came to return this. - But where—? Where did you find it? - Under your bed with the cosplay stuff. I borrowed it to own Woriyagi. Sorry. - No, you don't need to apologise. Thank you for coming. - I think it's time for GAME-anda to re-emerge. - I think so too. - Now we're going to take down the Johannas. Only take stuff that's got some value. You go over there, I'm going up here. - That's Beiron! - Where? - He's alone with the Johannas. We have to save him. - No, it's too dangerous. Let's call the police. - The phones aren't working. We have to solve this ourselves. - Håkan! Can't you just listen to me for once? - Yes. That's exactly what I intend to do. Literally. Here, take this. Turn off channels 1 and 2. OK? Trust me. Come up here. I've found—Hello? Have you found anything? Crap gear! Hello? Håkan should have been here! - Yes. He'd come up with something. Should we—? - I know what Håkan would've done. - What? - Rudolf, look! It's a ramp, a jump. - A ramp! - Okay? - Okay? - Yes. A ramp. - So—? - A ramp! - Full speed ahead, Chrille. - Aye, aye, captain. Here we go. - Wait. We should think this through. - Full speed. Here we go! - This isn't a good idea. - Woriyagi! I'm driving! - Did you see that? - My lumbago—my lumbago's gone! - Congratulations, Papi. Congratulations! - What a car! My lumbago's cured! - We're coming, Håkan! - Can you see the pool? - Yes, I can. - Go on forward then. - Okay. - Up the stairs. - Understood. Careful! Johanna's there. Beiron's to your right. - Understood. - Beiron! - Håkan, what are you doing here? - Come on. - Yes! Now you're one dead bastard. - You have to get the Johannas down into the garage. I can lock them up from here. - Who are you talking to? - GAME-anda. She's back. - Have you been playing all evening? - We've been doing side quests. There are thieves in the house. - Thieves in the house? - Thieves? We're playing hide and seek! - Amanda's in control via the cameras. - So how do we do it? - Beiron. We'll do as you say this time. - Thanks. Hello? - He's coming to you now. - Is there anyone here? Be careful, I know karate! What the hell—? Damn, that's disgusting. - Shit, shit, shit! Damnation! - Yes! Playing dead. Well done boys. I'll make sure to lock him up now. - This is completely insane. - So—Yes. What the hell—? What the hell kind of haunted house is this? Let me out! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Ghosts. - Yes! - OK, so one Johanna down. He's locked in the garage. Only one left. Be careful, I don't know where he is, he could be anywhere. Håkan, he's right behind you! - What's going on? Do I have to torture dwarves? Who are you? Who are you? - I haven't done anything! - It's only me! - Let me go! - Quiet! - Be careful, it's the ghost children. - No, it's the Sandméns kid. - My name's actually Andersson. - Quiet! Dwarves everywhere. - Bloody kids! They tried to trick me. - You're in big trouble now. You're going to regret that. Get it? We'll take them to headquarters, that's what we'll do. Shit! Hi. - Hello. - What're you doing here? - Hide and seek. - Why? - Just for fun. - OK. Actually, can I have my sword? Quick, help me with the costumes! - Last look round, then out to the pool. - yes. - So you were playing hide and seek? - Yes, I saved the party, like you said. - You're the best, Beiron. Come on out! Film the thieves. What's going on? - Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! - There's people everywhere! It's sick, this house. A sick house! - What's going on? Get us out of here. Get us out of here! Get us out of here! - What should we do? - Open the door! Open the door! - Find the remote. Look over there. - Here it is! - Get us out of here. Please! Get us out of here now. Please! - Now, now, now. - What—the hell? - Yes! - It's a witch. - Release the children! - We haven't done anything! It's a manga bitch! - Watch yourself! Hell! It's a ghost portal! It's a ghost portal! - No, it's the Sandmén girl. I knew it all along. Hurry up! Hurry up. - Damn, I'm too fat, I'm too fat! - Yes! - Good work. - You didn't do so badly yourself. - Teamwork. - All right now. Are you OK? What happened? - It's fine, we're safe. - We filmed everything. Shit crazy. What the hell kind of party is this? - What the hell's that? Get back! - Give me my beret! - You get it! A hungry ostrich does not refuse nutritious food. - Do something. - I don't dare. - Put down the sword. Calm down, everyone. I've seen this on TV, OK? I can do this. It's just scared, you know? - OK. - I'm going forward. Breathe, everyone. - Be quiet now. Do as Håkan says. - Okay, do as Håkan says. Gently. I've seen this. They're life-threatening. Do you like potatoes? - I don't think they eat potatoes, Håkan. - That's it. Here. Have a taste. See? He likes potatoes, same as me. Well done. What did I say? You have to stay calm. If you run around screaming, everything just turns to crap. - Håkan, you're awesome. - They're getting away! - The Johannas! - Watch out! - Now let's get out of here. Yes! Come on, ostrich! Nice tasty potato. Fetch! Good, ostrich! Close the door, Theo. Close the door, Amanda! - Yes! - Come on! After them! Yes! We did it! We got away! - Did you bring the loot? - Yes! - Didn't we do well! - Håkan! - Amanda! - It's not what it looks like. - Actually, yes, it certainly is. - Håkan! - Mum! - Are you okay? - Dad! - What have you done? - Open the child lock! - We played dead. Beiron's idea. Then there was the ostrich. You saw the rest. I'm getting a lot of new Woriyagi game ideas from this. Think about it. Woriyagi Africa: Bloodthirsty ostriches popping champagne corks. - Do I get a percentage of the game then? - We can talk about that. I heard you want a new computer. Maybe I can help you with that. - A new computer! - Karin? - Yes. How's the nose? - It'll be fine. You can tell Aron to send the contract. The Babblan app is a great idea. But now I have to get going. - Thanks! - Aron, Christian is in! - Daddy? You don't have to drive me. I'll take an Uber. Yes. But it was a shame. A real shame. - Hey you. Sorry I ditched you at the party. - No. Are you kidding? That was the best party in a long time. We had wine tasting, we played hide and seek with Beiron— and yeah, those costumes— - Yes, my son's. - Exactly. Your son's. But they're still— pretty awesome. - Woriyagi? - You play? - Yep, I'm a nerd. - Cool. - Look—thanks for— Sorry. - Nice one, Amanda. - Thanks, Håkan. - So it's the student council on Monday. - Yes, Beiron. Sorry and thanks for everything. - That was almost better than the game. - I'm reporting everyone for taking pictures of me. I have rights. I'm a human being. - You can take that up with your lawyer. - I have my rights. I'm human. The ghost children were real children. But the witch turned out to be a real witch And the ostrich was an ostrich all along. All I wanted was an awning. - Shut up! Parasols don't have the same cachet. Babblan saves library. For Glimmerdagg's library to invest in an audio book app— felt just right at this time, says Karin Andersson.' Congratulations darling. - Thanks. Håkan. Do you want to come to town with us to meet Sune and Anna? - No, I don't have time. I'll be with Beiron and Ronny. - Yeah? Are you going to finish building the ramp? - No, we're doing some student council work. Then I have a LAN meeting after school. - Well, there you are. I'll get it! Coming, coming. - Can I talk to the little one? - The little one? Yes, that'd be Håkan. Håkan! You have a visitor here. - Yes? - I think this is yours. - You can keep it. I got a new one. - A computer for me? - Yes. Sorry I borrowed your scooter. - Thanks to you I got my paintings back. We're even. - Oh! Lovely. Thanks. - Bye! - OK. Bye. - Then I'll bid you farewell. - Let me help you with the door there. Take it easy on the steps. - Well, just the two of us. - Yes. - I actually feel a new person. My back feels fine. - Yeah? - Hearing's back, new glasses— - Sexy. - Well yeah—I was thinking maybe we could come up with something. You and me. Tonight. Okay. - OK. - Something new and exciting. - Absolutely. OK. - Now we're going to overthrow Minoacles! - To the portal! - Nothing can stop us! - Wow! Cool place. - But we're still inside Woriyagi. - Mum, Dad, what are you doing here? - Hey, Håkan! Look, we're playing! - Don't tell me you're playing on a parent computer? - What do you mean? - Really cool cave. - Yeah! - What? Where did they come from? - No, it's only in the game. Look out! - Pull the cord, Håkan! Look out! Play dead! Okay. Mad Gunner here. Can I say hello? - And I vote for Håkan. - Me too! - I was freezing. - That's my cat. The moose boss is so going to be punished for this. English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2023
