Sonny... It's Christmas Eve, you gotta stop rearranging the tree. I know, I know. I just... I want it to be perfect when we take our Christmas Morning pictures. I don't know who's more obsessed with Christmas, you or Ari. Oh! Speaking of, is she's sleeping? Yeah, finally. Okay, great. I can start wrapping gifts. Okay, wait, hold on, let me... Let me check something quick. Oh, boy. What? What is it? You know how that streaming service bought the rights to my article about The Alamainian Peacock? Of course. How can I forget? You helped them turn it into a miniseries. Yeah, I also agreed to do a one episode special for them. Oh, my God, honey. That's great. Well, yeah, I mean, it would be, except um, I was expected to turn in a draft by midnight tonight and I haven't written a word. Oh, my God, what? Why not? Well, I got deadlines at the paper, and there's chaos back home. I mean, can you ask for an extension? I tried. And according the e-mail, they didn't buy my grandmother is possessed by the devil excuse. I... I'm afraid they're not gonna want to work with me again. I mean, you still have a couple of hours left until midnight. I can't write a whole movie in that time. I mean, what if I help you? I don't even have a story idea! What about a Christmas movie? ♪ ♪ - Where would we start? - Okay, well...

I've been going crazy trying to find those VR goggles that Ari wants from Santa so... I will have those dresses to you by Christmas. Well, hopefully you do. Or I'll have to take my business elsewhere. Hey, honey, I was thinking. You know, might just increase our business if we were to decorate a little bit more for the holidays. Make it more festive. Mom, you know how I hate Christmas. Okay, wait, why do she hates Christmas? Because there's always some tragic backstory, like someone she loved died on Christmas many years ago. Someone she loved... You know, your dad would hate it if he knew he was the reason for you losing your Christmas spirit. It's not just that, um, Christmas is not the way it used to be. It's all been coopted by big businesses now, it's all about materialism and greed. Doesn't have to be. It can be about... love, caring. Merry Christmas. Oh, Sydney, merry Christmas! - Look at you... - Oh. Can I have a hug? - Sure. - Oh! Hello, Samantha. Merry Christmas, EJ. Aw, look at you. Mm. What a pretty dress you have. Thanks, my mommy bought it for me. Custom made for her in Italy. Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I'm late. Looks like you bought out the entire haul in town square. Oh, well, what can I say, I was in the holiday spirit. I mean, who doesn't love Christmas? Oh, sorry. I mean, I know it's a hard time of the year for you. If I remember correctly, Sami, your father died on Christmas, and, Marlena, your beloved husband. Merry Christmas, kids! How's the cookie business? Well, dad, you gotta try these.

And then John is married to Kristen and your grandma Marlena is... Is the lonely widow. Are you intentionally trolling your family? Is for the benefit of the story. Yeah, but all these Christmas movies, they're about, you know, love. Yeah, what's a good love story without some twist and turns? Mm-hm. Those look good. Hey, you're eating all of our samples. I'm so sorry. They're just really good. Okay, why don't you come inside and buy a dozen or so? I should, but I'm... I'm actually late for something, I gotta go. Take this one for the road. Merry Christmas, thank you, these are so good. - Hey... - Cheap-ass mother... Eh-eh-eh... Mm. Hey, look, it is your boyfriend. Ah, what happened to all the samples? Brady cleared us out. - Oh, that's cold. - Yeah. But, don't worry, I saved something sweet... for my man. Gross. You said it, sis. You'd think Sydney doesn't have any dresses. Did you see how many bags Nicole had with her? Lot of bags. All right. Cappuccino? With a touch of cinnamon. - Oh... - Just the way you like it. You're a lifesaver. What are best friends for? Mm. Ah... Wait, okay, I'm... um... Gabi and Nick? - They're best friends? - Yeah. Why is Nick even a character in the story? Well, because he's part of the family, you know? And, uh, he moved back to get to know us Hortons and I saw a kinder, gentler side of him. Before he tormented you and Gabi and completely went over the edge? Yes, obviously before that. Okay, you... you are the writer. Yes, I am the writer who's on a roll thanks to you. Thank you, okay, so, moving right along. Okay, so, uh... This new and improved and sweeter and gentler Nick is secretly in love with his best friend. Yes, and even though he's perfect for her and he's right under her nose, she can't see it. Because... Because she has a crush on someone else. Christmas greetings one at all. - Brady, you're here! - Why, why... Why are you here? Oh. I'm here for my fitting, of course. I'm making him a bespoke suit. - Oh, now? - Mm-hm. Well, no, it's just, um... She was just... She was talking about... You were talking about how swamped... We're really swamped. No, I always have time for my favorite customer. Are you kidding me? Oh, you're gonna look so handsome. Even more handsome. I don't even know if that's possible. You... You're so kind. Ah, let me get my measuring tape. - Thanks. - Okay. Sydney, I was cleaning out some closets upstairs. I found all these supplies for making homemade ornaments. I'm not gonna have a Christmas tree so I thought you might like them. Thank you, Sami. Okay... Is there a problem? Oh, we don't have room for homemade ornaments. Mom. Honey, you know how we feel about glitter and it takes months to clean it up. Oh, the horror. Sorry. I... I should have asked first. Uh, how's... how's business? Oh, um, yeah. Well, um, you know, it's just hard staying afloat these days. I'm so sorry, I know how much this pub means to you. Yeah. Yeah, my grandparents built it from nothing and... passed it on to my dad. It must be rough. Letting down multiple generations of your family. Nicole. I'm just saying, you must feel an enormous amount of pressure. Ooh. You know what? Sami's been doing a fabulous job and... and Sean, Caroline, even Roman would be so proud of you. Thanks, mom. Oh, I found this outside, it's... it's got your name on it. Oh, I'm sure it's just a bill. The heck is this? What the heck is this? The heck is this? What the heck is this? Wait, what the heck is it? It's an eviction notice. What? It says that I have to close up the pub. I have to be outta here before Christmas. Mm, okay. Okay, harsh, but I see what you were doing. The eviction connects the stories together. Exactly. So who is the big bad Scrooge? The evil villain trying to toss our heroes out onto the streets? Well, it needs to be a total diva. I know who it should be. Wow, wow. Watch out, Salem. Price Town is back. It'll be the best Christmas ever. Mary, I need you in my office now. 1001, 1002, 1003, 1000... Yes, Miss Price. You're not Mary. You fired Mary last week. I'm Leo, her replacement. Wait, okay, I'm sorry. Leo Stark is in the story? Yeah. Every villain needs a weaselly henchman, right? And they don't make 'em any weasellier than Leo Stark. No lies detected, proceed. Mary! Leo, ma'am. Whatever. Did you deliver all the eviction notices? I did. Wish I could've seen the look on the faces of all those losers. Wah, wah! Ah, once they're out, there will be nothing to stop me from leveling this town and achieving my dream. 'Cause who doesn't love a big impersonal discount store? You silly little elf, Price Town isn't just a store anymore, it's a concept. It's luxury condos, exclusive restaurants, a whole new way of life, not just rinky-dinky mom-and-pop shops. Price Town is going to reinvent Salem, USA. And make me hella rich in the process. That does sound fabulous, boss. But if I may, there's just one teeny tiny hiccup. You're going to give me bad news? 'Cause I don't like bad news, Mary. Leo, and it seems that the property stretching from the Horton Town Square all the way to the Brady Pub sits on specially designated land. Designated by whom? The Office of Historic Preservation? That doesn't sound like a teeny tiny hiccup. That sounds like a biggie, largie hiccup. Well, I'm sorry, but I... Ow! What was that for? I don't like hearing problems! I like hearing solutions! Fix it, Mary! - How? - Well, uh... By doing what I do with everything. Throw money at it. EVICTION NOTICE Why would your mother be shutting us down? Ever since Abe ended things with her, Mom has gone full blown Cruella. We put our heart and soul into that bakery. I'm sorry, guys. I mean, this is just... This is devastating. Is it though? What do you mean? Look, don't get me wrong, opening the bakery with you has been amazing, but... I don't know, I... Real talk? I'm tired of waking up at the butt crack of dawn every day? And, I don't, know I've been itching to travel again. You know the, uh, Italian Alps are breathtaking this time of year. Ooh, I've always wanted to go there. I'm not sure if I can get time off. I understand. They must really rely on you down at the free clinic you're helping so many people. For free. Aw, it's not about the money. Mm, kinda is, though. I mean, I... I just want the world to acknowledge you for your talents. You know, the way I do. Aw. - Thanks, pookie - Of course, pookie. I think I'm gonna pukie. You and me both. I think I'm going to throw up. There must be some way to fight this. Miss Price owns this property. I don't know what I can do. We, Gabi, all right? No matter what happens, we're in this together. Yep. Look at me. You're a talented, bright young woman. Okay? You have so much promise, you're gonna weather this storm. You really think so? I know so and I'm rarely if ever wrong, okay? All right. Um, about my fitting, can we? You know what? I'm just thinking the timing on that might not be perfect. Yeah, I noticed the mood has changed a little bit, Oh, do you really know how to read a room? We'll reschedule. I... I'll call you, yes, I will call you, so we can figure out the fitting. Are you sure you're gonna be able to get it done by Christmas Eve, though? I mean, just in case you close... Okay, that's like a week from now. I mean, it's just... There's... there's higher things on... on your priority list. Okay, no problem, I'll get it done. Gabi. Yes? You are the best. Oh... Booted out at Christmas? Honey, I know how much you love our little inn. We still have each other. And we'll get through it. Together. Oh, get a room you two, but you got plenty to choose from. Not for long. We just found out we're getting evicted. You too. What do you mean? I just heard that Gabi, she and Sweet Bits, they got eviction notices too. Seems Paulina Price is dumping all of her tenants at once. I wonder if that means the pub is getting shut down too. I'm so sorry, Samantha. Bad things happen at Christmas. You know? It's when my dad died. It's when Lucas ran off with a drippy Chloe to Antarctica. Well, I for one, love Christmas, the extravagant parties, the lavish gifts. That's not really what it's about, mommy. I can't wait to see what EJ gets me this year. Oh, I have my eye on this exquisite sapphire necklace. Nicole, maybe we should be a little more sensitive to what Samantha and Marlena are going through? I'm sorry, am I being insensitive? Yes, I love the pub and I don't want it to go away. Oh, neither do I, Syd. Excuse me, I'm... I'm gonna make a call and see if I can get some help with this. Oof, oof! We're going to need some help down here. Maybe even a Christmas miracle. John. Hello, Marlena. Oh, I see. You got the same eviction. Yeah. Certainly was a kick in the gut, but... thankfully, I have Kristen lean on. Brady. I thought you left with your father. I forgot that I have a gift for you. You wanna open it? ♪ ♪ SALEM INN ONE WEEK LATER... Oof! Good morning, Marlena. John. What brings you by the Salem Inn? Uh. Oh, I was in the neighborhood and... I... I thought I would drop off your Christmas card in person. Oh, thank you. That's so nice. Yeah. Kristen and I have one for you also. Oh, thanks. Where is your wife this morning? She wasn't feeling well. Took the morning off. Nothing serious, I hope. No, no. I'm sure she'll be feeling much better after she spends some time in bed. Merry freaking Christmas! And happy freaking New year. You know what? I know Christmas Eve isn't till tomorrow. I think now is a good time to give you your gift. Oh, come on, what are you talking about? You have been giving me fantastic gifts all week long, not to mention the amazing gift you just gave me. - You know... - Just, please, let a girl catch her breath? I'm talking... I'm talking about... an actual gift. - What's that? - Open it and find out. No. What do you mean "no"? Why not? Because... our relationship is built on lust. And, um, romantic gestures just... complicate things. Look. Kristen, I know that's where we started. John is my husband and I love him. Do you? I mean, do you? Do you really? He makes me feel safe. Safe. When did safe become a priority of yours? Come on, what about... What about passion? What about... I like things the way they are. Are you really ever going to be content with just being an innkeeper's wife, Kristen? I mean, come on, you want more. Don't you want more? Not from you. I'm sorry. I just don't want your gifts. I don't want your money. I don't want anything else that's going on in that brain of yours. - I see. - All I want is this. So, basically, what I am to you is just a hard... Body. Yeah. And if you can't accept that, then I guess you're just gonna have to move on. - Looks pretty good. - Yeah. How you doing? I... I mean, I know this is a... a rough time of year for you. Well, I miss Roman. I guess they always will. May I ask you something? Of course. Why haven't you moved on? I mean, I'm... I'm sure there are... Must be someone out there for you somewhere. Good morning people. How we feeling today? Well, not great, Miss Price. Fabulous, fabulous. Just passing through with a friendly reminder that you need to be out by Christmas. We hadn't forgotten. Mm-hm, good, good. You know, Paulina. You can evict us. You can... throw us out on the street, but the city will never let you destroy these historic sites for your precious Price Town and that's a fact. Well... I wouldn't be too sure about that. OFFICE OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION Come in. I'm sorry to bother you, sir. My name is Leo Stark and I was hoping we could have a little chat. Hello, Mr. Stark. How can I help you? Oh, so, so, Xander runs the Office of Historic Preservation. - Yeah, I like casting its type. - Mm. Plus, Leo's always had a crush on Xander and I thought it might be fun for those two to cross again. - Yeah, fun for Leo anyway. - Yeah. There's something wrong, Mr. Stark? No, it's just... Office of Historic Preservation, I was expecting some old creaky relic, not a big strapping hunk. Is there something I can do for you? I want to answer that in so many ways. I'm sorry? Let me start over. My boss, Paulina Price... Oh, you work for Miss Price. Yes, and she submitted a proposal for new construction? Mm, I'm... I'm aware, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to... decline her request. What, why? Why? Your boss's plans for Salem are unethical and offensive. She'd be tearing out the very heart of this town. Okay. So what if she made a donation to your office? A very generous one. Cash. Is this a bribe? More like an incentive? A gift for a job well done? I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. It's a lot of money. Some things are more important than money. Like what? Are you aware that some of these businesses have been around for over 50 years? Then isn't it time for a change? New businesses can be cheaper to run. Look, I'm all for progress and innovation. But it must honor the... The history of this town. These places that your boss wants to tear down, they aren't... just relics of the past. They're the soul of Salem. They're bringing the community together, uniting people from all walks of life and those experiences and traditions are passed down from one generation to the next, providing a common thread for all the people that live in this town. So your boss wouldn't just be tearing down buildings, she would be demolishing the connective tissue of Salem itself. So... Is that a definite no? DENIED Sydney, honey don't run, you're gonna ruin your shoes EJ can you please talk to your daughter and ask her to please act more like... What? What are you doing? EJ. I'm just helping the poor man out. He's just gonna spend it on drugs and alcohol. You don't know that. Where's your Christmas spirit? Or perhaps I would be more festive if we didn't have to keep coming to this dreadful hole in the wall that is run by her ex. Sydney loves it here and she loves spending time with Samantha. Sydney. Santa pancakes! I made them especially for you. Okay... You got this, and we have... That's for you. Sydney DiMera put that fork down. What's the problem? Uh, it's loaded with sugar and carbs is the problem. Sweetheart, it's almost Christmas and Samantha already went through all that trouble. Well, she could have asked me. Come on, Sydney, honey come over here and we'll get you something healthy to eat. Good girl. Uh, sorry... about overstepping again. No, no, you didn't do anything wrong. You're wonderful with her. I just think Nicole gets a little threatened by that sometimes. What is it? It's... it's just sometimes when I look at the date. Can't help but think about... Our daughter? Grace would have been the same age. I'm so sorry, Samantha. I miss her too. SWEET BITS BAKERY CLOSED Hey, isn't it a little early to pack it in? Well, we're getting evicted anyway so I was in the mood for some shopping. That is an excellent idea. I have my eye on this new watch. Ooh, I want a new watch too. It's Christmas. You're supposed to get gifts for other people. Okay, but isn't loving yourself the greatest gift of all? See? Now, she gets me. How about we go ice skating at the park? Ooh, yes, yes. I like the way you think. Okay, but I don't want to miss the last minute sales. Well, we can do both, pookie. Okay, pookie. But shopping first. All right, we'll catch up with you later. Mm-hm. Drives me crazy. What? Tripp putting Chanel's needs above his. Just so typical of him, right? So kind and unselfish. Wait. Are you in love with Tripp? What no, no he's my BFF's boyfriend Look, Allie, it's okay, no one's judging you. I... If I'm being honest, uh... I'm kind of in the same boat. Are you in love with trip? No. But I'm totally in love with Chanel. Denied? Nobody denies me. He wouldn't take the money. You're a disgrace, get out of my office! Ay! I'm sorry, Miss Price, I tried! But did you know that some of these buildings have been here for over 50 years and Mr. Cook he made this impassioned speech about... Out, I said. Wait! Where's my money? Oh, right. Hm. Textbook Mary. Oh, well, if you want something done right, do it yourself. At least find the right partner in crime. Hello, this is Paulina Price. We need to talk. You cannot be serious. "Die Hard" can't be the best Christmas movie ever. Well, it takes place on Christmas Eve. But it's about a guy killing terrorists. To save the woman that he loves. It's about family and friendship... - And bloodshot... - And bloodshed? Yes, okay... Okay, what's a better Christmas movie? Oh, I don't know. "It's a Wonderful Life," maybe? Oh come on, boring, so boring. Basic. "Home Alone"? "Home Alone" is... Is just "Die Hard" for... for kids. Okay, "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." Everybody loves the Griswolds. Griswolds, brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Cousin Eddie, obviously the best character "Save the neck for me, Clark." What do you... What are you doing tonight? Uh. Nothing. Literally nothing, why? Do you wanna go to the pub? There's this cookie decorating thing. - Be my partner. - Yes. Absolutely, you're on. I knew I could count on you to be my bestie. Yeah. Actually Gabi, there's... There's something that I wanted to talk to you about. Ah, good. They didn't close it down yet. Brady! Is the suit... is it ready? Oh, yeah, just right here. Oh, God, it looks great. I knew I could count on you. Hot date tonight? Uh, sadly, no, no. The woman I'm into is not into me the same way. Are you sure, have you... Who told her how you feel? No, I don't know. I mean, I... I hate rejection. I'm not used to it, so I'm... Not really great at expressing my feelings. I tend to trip over my words a little bit. Maybe you can, uh, write her a letter. That's... Actually a great idea. - I like that. - Yeah. Oh, this suit looks great. How much do I owe you? Oh, we're... you know what? It's nothing. Gift for Christmas. - Really. - Really? Yeah, you've been such a wonderful customer and the store is gonna close down anyway. Well, at least let me... Let me send you a little something in return. Can I have your address? Oh, yeah, kidding me? Of course you have... my address. Thanks, thanks. Um, suit looks great. Thank you. You think he was talking about me? What do you mean? The woman that he said he has feelings for, that he's afraid to open up to. He said he might write her a letter and then he asked me for my address. To thank you for the suit. I don't know, I just, I... I kind of feel a vibe. I don't know if it's the Christmas spirit but... Kind of feel like all my dreams are coming true. Yes, well, thank you. I'm glad we could come to an understanding. Oh, yeah, be in touch. Well, Mary, I did it. The city has approved the construction of Price Town, But Hottie McHotFace wouldn't accept the bribe. Oh, I found a way around that. It's all happening. Nothing could stop me now. Are you sure about this, boss? Those places, they mean a lot to this town. This calls for a celebration of epic proportions, steak, lobster, champagne. Well, that does sound divine. Shall I make a reservation at the Penthouse Grill? Yeah, for one, since it was a little old me who sealed the deal and you, you did diddly squat. So you know what? You get to stay here and clean up my office. And don't forget to email one last reminder about the evictions. Ta-ta, Mary. It's Leo. It was so good of you to think of this. Oh, wow, I may not like Christmas but I do enjoy spending time with my family and friends and it's nice to be able to lift their spirits, especially given the circumstances that we're about to lose everything. Snazzy shirt I bought him, huh? Looks a little tight. It's fine, as long as I don't exhale. I love the way it shows off your muscles, pookie. Well, hey, if he doesn't want it. Looks like it might fit me, so... See, now Johnny here has excellent taste. I feel like you're more of a flannel kind of guy, maybe a size too big. I do enjoy breathing. Oh, look who's here! Oh, mom, we have a real life princess here tonight. We just got back from seeing The Nutcracker, didn't we? Did you like it? Boring. Nobody even talks. Oh, dear. Nicole stayed behind for the official gala. I thought this might be more Sydney's speed. - Yeah, of course. - Well, yeah, good, you can... You can be a team. I want Sami on our team. It's pairs of two, honey. Oh, wait, wait, I'm judging. I think I can make an exception. - Yay! - Yay! Why don't... Why don't you find a place? We're about to get started. Yeah, uh, all right, why don't you go there? I'll meet you in a minute. Take your coat off. Something wrong? Oh, no. No, I... I was just... hoping John might be coming by. Now, are you sure that you don't want to go to Marlena's party? Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I'm just really... I'm just really not in the mood tonight. It's all right. Hey, maybe we can just snuggle up in bed, watch a holiday movie, Maybe the one with Hugh Grant when he plays the Prime Minister and a guy from the zombie show. I just love it when he comes to the door holding those big signs. Really? Don't you think it's just a little sappy and... kind of stalkery. No, it is romantic and it's sweet. Oh, come on, give it another chance, I guarantee... it will melt your heart. This is interesting. Yeah. Yeah. - I think this border... - There, there. Yeah, what do you think? Is it too much? Damn it. What? - What's wrong? - I just... I lost another bid for the VR goggles that Ari wants for Christmas. What am I gonna do? They're sold out everywhere. - Really? Hmm. - Yeah. Well, that might be because I bought the last pair? Wait, you bought them? Why? For you to give to Ari. I mean, I heard you talking about how hard it was to find them and... And you did that for me? Of course I did. Gabi, I'd... I'd do anything for... Um, uh... Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, I have made my decision but first let me say that you are all winners in my book. I should say on these very trying times, you brought Christmas cheer. And that fills us all with joy. Hear, hear! Now, there can only be one champion. So the winners of this year's Brady Pub Christmas Cookie Decorating... is... Nick and Gabi! Ooh! Nick, we won! - We did it. - We sure did. And you make quite a team. Yeah, yeah. I'll give it to him. Hey, what kind of devilish judge doesn't pick her own grandkids? Well, I calls them like I sees them. In fact, Allie's gingerbread man looks a lot like Tripp's. And yours looks a lot like Chanel's. Hm. Maybe y'all should have switched partners, hm? Let me help you with this, you got a little... Look, Mommy, we made a gingerbread man. Oh, wow. Oh, and got frosting all over your new dress. I'm sorry. It's okay, honey. It'll come out in the wash. That is her answer for everything. Can we talk about this in private, please? Be right back, Syd. Daddy is in trouble, ugh. You know what? I think I can get it out. Let me just see if I can fix this real quick. Yeah, look, see? Yeah, ha! Perfect. Perfect. Sami, can I tell you a secret? Of course you can. I wish you were my mommy. Oh... Kristen, what are you doing in there? My favorite scene is coming up. Be right there! God, I'm gonna need this to get through the rest of that movie. Shh. What the world? Who's at the door?

Apparently, a Salem law from 1965 states that any small business owner operating in an historic district for at least a year has the right to buy out their lease. So that's it? Price Town is dead in the water? Oh, hell, no, hell, no, Mary, they only have until midnight tonight to raise the money and those deadbeats over there they're barely making ends meet. So if they can't scrounge up the cash, it's eviction time in Salem. Full speed ahead! Oh, a Christmas Eve deadline. Just like your script. - Very meta. - Yeah. Gotta push on the climax, Our characters are running out of time. Ooh, and so are we. Okay, everybody, thank you all for coming. I know you'd rather spend Christmas Eve with your families but, um... but we are running out of time to save our businesses. John, have you been able to pull together enough money to buy our leases? Even pulling our resources we're coming up short. So pooling was a mistake. But maybe we can still save a couple of the businesses, right? No, no. We have to stick together. It's all or nothing. I have to agree with Marlena. Couldn't you ask your mom to give us an extension? I can try. But I doubt she'll change her mind. Damn it, you guys, I mean, there must be a way to get that money by midnight, we... We can't just give up. You're right. You are right, Gabi, we can't. So... I have an idea. CHRISTMAS EVE TALENT SHOW FUNDRAISER So, what do you think? How's it look? Perfect. You know, for someone who's not a fan of Christmas, you've certainly gotten into the spirit. I know, right? I don't know what's come over me. So, do you think this fundraiser will get you over the line? I hope so, that's our last best shot. I talked to WXIR and they're going to broadcast the whole thing, so that'll bring a lot more eyeballs too. - That's great! - Yeah. And I'll donate as much as I can. Oh, no, EJ. I'm not asking that. No, no, no, it's my pleasure, but unfortunately all of DiMera's assets are now temporarily frozen. What? What happened this time? The SCC is after us again. I'm sure it will blow over, but not in time to donate to your cause. I see. But I'm willing to do whatever I can to... to help out. - Really? - Mm-hm. Well, I'm really glad that you say that because, um... Do have a costume for you. Uh... Costume? I was told to pick up my costume for the show. We have to stop meeting like this. - What? - Because of the suit and now... - Here it is. - Okay. Uhm, you know? I thought about what you said. About, um, expressing my feelings for the woman that I love. Yes. And I decided to take your advice. And? And she turned me down. Flat. Oh, I see, I'm so sorry. Thank you. I guess it's time for me to just, you know, move on. Yeah, but then you know, maybe you and I can hang out sometime. Oh, um... Thanks, I'm... I'm flattered, Gabi, but... I really think we should keep our relationship professional. I mean we work for rival companies, right? Yeah, right, yeah, of course. But thank you, thank you. Yeah. Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot. Ugh! No. Gabi, you're wrong. Brady Black is the idiot. He doesn't deserve you. Wow. Everybody, this is Allie and Chanel. Co-owners of Sweet Bits. Wow, that was fantastic. What an interesting choice to cover the Indigo Girls. Well, I want to thank all of you so much. All of you out there for being so generous. GOAL But, as you can see, we haven't reached our goal yet, so, please keep those donations coming. Oh, give it up, honey! It's almost midnight and that meter is about as dead as this mink. You are never gonna stop Price Town from happening. Oh, the show isn't over yet. I beg your pardon? There's still one more act. How do you know that? Because I booked it. You did what? Who do you think tipped everyone off about the loophole in the law? You? How could you stab me in the back, Mary? After everything I've done for you, Mary! For the last time my name is... You know what? Let's go with Mary, but with an E and two Rs as in Merry Christmas. If you don't mind... - I don't mind at all. - Thank you. Ladies, gentlemen... or however you identify, I would like to present our grand finale, the incomparable We Three Queens. Please welcome to the stage Miss Sunny Delight. Ow! Wilhelmina Shakespeare! Oh, okay, okay, nice-nice try. Yeah. What? We need a grand finale. That's not what I meant and you know it. Fine. Here you go. Amanda Bottom!

You did it, Samantha. This is all because of you. Well, I had a lot of help and I'm just so grateful. I mean, you know, to everyone. Oh, I should give you back your pants. Thank you. And you should be happy too, because you deserve it. Thank you, EJ. Thank you so much. You're welcome. You know, I don't think this night could be any more perfect. John, it's snowing. What? Doesn't this place have a roof? It's a Christmas miracle. Well, Dad, we did it. I wired the money just in time. The Brady Pub is here to stay. But you know that, don't you? Because you were here looking out for me the whole time, weren't you? Sami Brady, you and I are going to get something straight. What now, Nicole? I saw you uglying my husband earlier. Uglying, really? Yes and you're gonna stay away from him. And while you're at it, stay away from my daughter, too. Except she isn't your daughter, is she, Nicole? What? What are you talking about? I just had a talk with Rafe Hernandez. The man is a self-righteous Neanderthal but he uncovered a great injustice. What are you saying? Samantha. Our child didn't die all those years back. Nicole switched the babies. What? Sydney is your daughter, not Nicole's. My daughter. No, no, that is not true. Sydney is my daughter. She's my daughter. No. Oh! Say it. Sydney... is EJ's and my daughter, isn't she? No. Oh! Say it, Nicole! "She's Sami's child." Sydney is mine and I'm gonna make you say it. Sydney... Sydney is yours. Horton's winding down? Is it? I barely noticed. What do you want to do now? We could, uh... Go back to my place and watch the Griswolds or we could watch Bruce Willis kill a bunch of terrorists in his bare feet. I thought "Die Hard" wasn't Christmas movie. You know, I'm starting to see things in a whole new light. So, this is... Awkward? It doesn't have to be. Yeah, she's right, you know? I... I think we'll all be happier this way. I mean, we're finally matched with the person we're meant to be with, don't you think? Uh-huh. Right, Dupree? Yeah, Horton. Totally. Hello, Historical Society guy. Mr. Stark, you know you did a wonderful thing tonight. I was pleasantly surprised to see you in the show. Really, why? Paulina convinced somebody from the City to approve her plans, I was worried it was you. No, not me. Mm. I wonder who helped her, then. If that wasn't so humiliating, my plans foiled by a drag show, of all things. I gave it my best shot. I called in all my favors to get that variance for you. Too bad it was all for nothing. Well, at least you don't have to keep running that stupid inn. Not to mention, I think I've blown my one chance to real happiness. Seems I had you pegged all wrong. You and the rest of the human race. Seriously, you should be proud of yourself. You helped to save the town. I did, didn't I? May I ask, what made you change your tune? Honestly, it was that passionate speech you gave me about tradition and some things being more important than money. I didn't think you were listening. Not listening? Honey, I'm gonna needlepoint that speech into a pillow. Well, I'm flattered. Somehow you got through to me in a way nobody else ever has. Can't quite explain why. Merry Christmas, Leo. This town doesn't deserve you. You came here to gloat? I came here to invite you to Christmas brunch. Me and Johnny and Allie and Tripp we're calling it "A Very Swappy Christmas." You want me there after I tried to evict you? Well, you're an awful Grinch. But you're still my mom. And I know there's a great big heart in there somewhere. I love you, baby. I love you, too, Mama/ - Oh... - Merry Christmas. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did Santa come? Is it time to open presents? Oh, yeah, my darling. But we do have a gift for you. Sami? What are you doing in my room? Well. Sydney... your Christmas wish... has come true. I'm your mommy. What? You are? She is? She is. Nothing could make me happier. I love Christmas, mommy. And I love you. Oh, sweetheart, I love you so much. - Excuse me. - Uh, wait. Hi. Hi. I can't stop thinking about that... little performance you gave last night. Well, we've already established that you... like my hard body. - I do. - Hm. I do, but it... no, it was more what you said. Actually, what you wrote. And... I just want to tell you that I love you, too. - You do? - I do. I mean, I really, really do. And I want to be with you. For real. If you still have me. Oh, God, Kristen. Come on. Such a big girl! Hold on, let me get the bed ready. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Let's take those slippers There you go. Now... You close your eyes so that Santa can deliver your presents. And we'll see you in the morning. I can't believe it. I can't believe she's really mine. She's our child, Samantha. I meant to be a family. When I fix all this mess with Nicole, maybe you and I can... Maybe you and I could... What a Christmas. And the awful truth came out. Oh, God. Please, forgive me. You know what? I take that back. After what I did to Sydney and EJ and Sami, I don't deserve forgiveness. Everyone deserves forgiveness. Oof. Oh... John? Ah, hey. Is everything all right? Kristen and I we're... We're gonna get a divorce. Oh. I'm so sorry. Thank you, Doc. Doc. You haven't called me that in years. No, I guess I haven't. Would you like to sit with me for a little bit? I would. Well, look at that. All right... Merry Christmas, Doc. Merry Christmas, John. "And as they nuzzle up in front of the roaring fire, "snow falling gently outside, "the clock chimes midnight and we fade to white." "The end." And? Just under the wire. All that's left is to hit "send." Shall we... Shall we do it together? Yes, please. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for helping me with this. Of course. We just, like, completed a miracle. Yeah, and you know what? We got to spend Christmas in Salem. Even if we couldn't actually be there in person, You know, writing all that... it made me miss it. You know? Miss them. Yeah, me, too. We'll have to visit soon. Hm. It's midnight here, too. Merry Christmas, honey. Merry Christmas... pookie. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!
