"For you and me" "Where have the games gone, my love..." "That you and I played?" "Where have the games gone, my love..." "That you and I played?" "Two pieces of sugarcane each for you and me" "Where have the games gone, my love, that you and I played?"

Come on, son. -Hang on, dad Uncle, your servant sings well Your daughter plays well with hearts Why don't you learn music? You'd set up a drama company at home I--- Now what? Nimmo has gone after Karam to placate him What do I do then? Go and bring Nimmo back Who do I bring back? One who denied the engagement ring in public? You want me to bring her back? Don't kids have any responsibility towards their parents...? Should parents tell them that also? Look, it's not Nimmo's fault We should peep into ourselves Do you remember what you told Nimmo about Karam? Looks like she's back. No matter what, go and tell her the truth Yes, I lied. I lied that Karam married and went to Canada Because I didn't wish to have anything... with Sukhi's family And don't forget that your wedding is fixed with Pal Then you also don't forget, Papa, that while leaving the village... you had yourself fixed my alliance with Karam Do you want me to dig old graves, and talk to the dead? No! I want to forget the streets of the village just as I would a nightmare You want to revive the nightmare? | want to remind you of the promise you made to Sukhi | will keep the relationship... that I had with Karam in childhood Don't you have any duties towards your parents...? Who raised and educated you? I'll be indebted to you forever, one lie from you sowed hatred in my heart for my own village And I'm very grateful to Karma, who turned that hatred into love again Trust me, the love for me that I saw in the eyes of Karam, has wiped out Pal's name from my heart forever Mummy, you know that your daughter will never do a wrong Yes dear So, on my behalf tell Papa that... marriage is an important turn in a girl's life And by taking Karam's hand I've taken that turn You know that I'm very stubborn. | say once, it's forever Why are you In tears? What's the matter? Only a mother can understand a daughter's grief You just don't care Do you even know? Nimmi hasn't eaten anything since three days You are strange. You think I'm stone-hearted? If Nimmo doesn't eat, it's her wish. Not my fault She is also stubborn like you. Just watch She'll marry Karam, no one else Look, God has given us only one daughter We just want to see her happy. What difference does it make... if she marries Karam or Pal Your business is so vast Karam can help you in your business Karam is an oaf, a wastrel. What can he do? Nothing What could you do back home? You used to ply a horsecart Karam Is a boy of this generation He'd be knowing a few things more than you, not less Nimmi, my child... what am I hearing? Won't you talk to your father? Your mother told me that you haven't eaten for days My childhood sweetheart was humiliated Even after that you think I'll feel hungry? But dear, whatever I did was for your welfare If you love Karam so much, then fine, I'll marry you off to him Really, Papa? - Happy? Papa, you are great. - My crazy little daughter | love you, Papa. You are great But I have a request, my child. - Please tell me, Papa I have seen village life rather closely And I know your nature | feel after marriage, you won't take a liking to the village No way All I request is, after marriage... you and Karam should live with me Whatever belongs to me, belongs to you and Karam, right? Am I right, dear? -Yes Great Are you happy, my child? - I'm very happy, Papa You remember your promise? - What promise, Papa? Strange. You and Karam will be living with us Yes, yes It's a joyous occasion, Mr Chopra. Take it Very pretty Stop it Stop it! You'll die Sukhli, did you ever imagine, we'd have such a blast at Karam's wedding? I never imagined it'd be so grand, really It's His orders. God's grace Sukhl, it's not God's grace, it's my grace My daughter insisted on marrying your penniless brother | agreed On the condition that she and Karam will live in my house He had come to my house for a job, now I think of confirming his job I'll pay him handsomely Karam will forget the roads to his village Food is my forte There's less salt in chicken, check it I'll get it checked. - Go ahead. If I'm wrong, I'll slipper your head Listen Karam, how did you find the girl? Does her father own a pizza hut? No. He's a cook at your hotel She's not from Delhi, she used to play right here Play? You mean in a team? Hockey? Full back? Forward? Goalkeeper? Goal! Tell me honestly, am I right or wrong? Seems wrong, but it might be just right Gurdit Singh said, Karam's wife is educated in the city She won't be interested in the village. - Why do you care? Shut up, ass! Give me the chicken, let me check the salt Where's the chicken? - Ate it You've bought the bones for immersion after cremation He's cleaned the bones as if he has used a whitener You've cleaned it so well, 1 give you full marks It depends on Karam, how he manages to keep his wife happy You know what I mean by happy? Harnam Singh, you are talking like a boy who's going to join college You are wagging your tongue amongst oldies Beat that "If you are making a nose-stud for your wife, " "buy us jewellery too, else.." "Relationships will break" "I could die for you" "Sell me at the market..." "And buy an ornament for yourself" Papa? Yes Papa, Nimmi here Of course You are just bothering yourself. I remember I haven't spent a night in the village yet It doesn't happen in a trice Yes, I remember my promise. Okay Papa, I'll hang up What happened, Nimmo? What's on your mind? Karam I was wondering, had we met a little later, had I married someone else... and then found out the truth... what'd have happened? It was impossible, Nimmi. You were destined for me How can someone else take you away? Know how I found you? - How? A chunk of jaggery, handful of sugar, has anyone seen my Nimmi? Here, here, here, here... I've found her! Sukhi! Kulwant and Kuljeet are fighting again over their shares. Please come Let's go I'll fix you! You think big of yourself, eh ? I'll fix you! Thinking big, eh? All thanks to you for provoking your husband There! Even she's got a tongue. The liar becomes a lawyer You steal the house to fill up your parents' coffers Don't drag my parents in! I'll burn your tongue. One doesn't rob beggars I'll fix you! - Just you wait, I'll break your teeth Had we known you'd ruin this house, we'd never have taken you as a bride | filled up your house. I brought a truckload of dowry with me Just you wait! I'll fix you'! - Let go! I'll show you Let go! Why are you fighting? You ought to be ashamed Stop it! Are you guys crazy? Are you out of your minds? - Sukhi, it's beyond repair now You decide for us. - Decide what? You grab your elder brother's throat and you want a decision, eh? Chief, Sukhi... summon the council. I want my sh are, we can't stay together Yes, summon anyone you want! -Cut the crap! Do whatever you want, summon the council Let the secrets unravel, let the world know what's in your house Damn yourselves! Here you are, Kulwant And Kuljeet The council has decided for you Harnam Singh, - Yes chief? Go to their house, make a note of all the things, divide them into two and build a wall in between Very well, chief Well, do you brothers have anything to say? No, everything is fine Kulwant Singh, what are you thinking of now? | wanted to ask you something, Sukhi. - Tell me I and my brother played together, studied together, slept under one blanket... and what went wrong? We even divided our vessels! It always happens in families But why does it happen, Sukhi? Not always, it happens in the families... that bring home bedrocks, not brides On a bedrock is raised a wall There are few tigresses who leave their bedrocks at their parents' You mean all the fault lie with the womenfolk? No. It takes two to tango The fault lies more with the elders The elders must separate the boys even before their weddings Or, they must be tactful and sensible enough... to keep the family united, like a fist Stanki, how's our new hotel? Do we have the counter rolling? Boss, the Vastu Shastra expert said the entrance should face the east, so that it'll pull crowds in hordes. Not even a flea has entered yet, forget about customers. - Find out if this is east Because |I've never seen the rising sun. Well, don't lose hope Someone might drop in God is merciful. An army of saints Saint Girdharilal from Dhuni has come to grace your new hotel Luck will shine on your hotel from now on Stanki, quickly lay three plates. - We are four And tell the cooks to make bread Son, your hotel will prosper and flourish from now on Clarified butter for the bread! Add cardamom to the vegetable dish Make it three! - But we are four, brother Your hotel will turn into a five-star Don't you think there's too little space? Anyway, the saint's blessings will do the job Make Malai Kofta also for three But we are four. -Son, by the saint's grace, you will soon own a 35 feet long car worth 3.5 million Three pudding, chilled! At least make the pudding four Make it four! Happy? You have ordered so much, son. But nothing seems to have come out yet Actually... come here See, we both have been playing with words If you have money, if you have conned someone, you can eat here. Or, move on Watch your tongue! Or, the saint will curse you That's like it! I knew he sells liquor Saint, let me have a quarter Fool! Not liquor, curse! I shall curse you! - Just you listen I'll rip you apart with this! What is found is what is earned. Keep it, we can use it for grinding I'm very happy, Karam Nimmi was separated in childhood, today she has returned home Now that you are here, relieve me What can I do for you, brother? - Take care of the house Marry her off, bring a bride for him... Any problem? - No way Sure? - Brother, give her the keys... and make it easy for us. - Easy? How? It's hard to dig your pocket, but we can raid her purse at will Here you are, dear God bless you Lord, my Master, save my little family from the evil eye "May no one cast an evil eye upon my little world" "May no one cast an evil eye upon my little world" "May this family be always happy and prosperous" "Every moment this heart prays to God Almighty, " "May this family be always happy and prosperous" "In our courtyard, happiness abound" "It's the mercy of the Lord, it's His care" "With a mother's love and desires..."

He personifies affection” "Every moment he wears a smile, he lives amongst us" "May God always keep this beautiful garden fragrant" "May this family be always happy and prosperous" Hello Nimmi, how are you? - I'm fine, Papa I hope you remember the promise you made to me during your wedding? You said you will set Karam apart from his brothers and bring him to me I have also built an office for him, dear No need for it, Papa. - Why? I'm not coming now. - What? I'm very happy with Karam and my family "Blossoming buds, fragrant crops, " "peacocks singing, sparrows tweeting..." "The fields are rich, faces wear smiles, " "every evening in our house we celebrate” "A newly wed bride has come home" "She adds to the glory of our house" "Our sweet home is mesmerising" "If there's paradise, it must be like this" "May our love and affection forever be" "May this family be always happy and prosperous" Papa, you? - I don't have time, dear Put yours and Karam's stuff in my car and come with me But Papa, I told you on the phone not to come over for me Fine, but you had promised me before the wedding | did that because I hadn't met brother Sukhi and Channi I hadn't seen Guddi either If you spend a night with us, Papa, you might not feel like going away What use studying in a convent? How could you decide to live in this filthy place? Look... look around! Is this place for humans to live? This is where humans live, Papa Here, I found myself. You taught me to cover my head inside a gurudwara But to bow before the Lord, this village taught me | lived with you as a daughter But I got the honour of being a daughter-in-law in this house Bless me, to be happy at my in-laws I'm not here to offer blessings Just tell me, are you and Karam coming with me? No, never! I'll never leave my in-laws Not even in death It's along journey, Dhanwant Singh, and you are alone. It'd be better if you have some tea and snacks Nimmi must not lose courage Don't No Nimmi, don't Don't weep Look at the pearl from your eyes It's full of love and honour of this house Should it break, it'd also break my heart All of us will work hard to take care of this pearl now All of us Guddi, listen. - No way Guddi, listen to me... - I'm not listening to anything I don't want your gift either. -Should I go to the city to return it? Did I ask you to bring it? - I've bought it now, take it | have brothers. If I need something, I'll ask them What's the matter, Guddi? Why are the two of you brawling? Bhabhi, he's barging in uninvited I didn't ask for anything, and he's bought bangles for me Sister, you do justice. I had been to the city to buy belts and books So I also bought red bangles for her. You tell me, is there a need to brawl? I'm giving her something, I'm not taking anything Guddi, come here Does these red bangles say something to you? Did you hear them speak? No. -I've heard it Get inside. And you, go home I'll decide for you The righteous belong to God! Glory be to God Sat Sri Akal. - Sat Sri Akal I need to talk to you, brother Tell me, dear Guddi has grown up. Have you thought of her marriage? I've put Kapoor Singh on duty He frequents the city. He'll tell us if there's a suitable boy What does uncle Kapoor's son Harbhajan lack? Nothing But I never thought about him But they have thought about each other It's another thing that they always keep brawling Really? May God save them from the evil eye. Such a match is coincidental Kapoor Singh's...? Why didn't I think of it before? I'd have got Guddi married to him long back "When the wedding music is played, " "the daughter becomes a stranger" "The eyes rain tears, " "as the apple of the eye leaves" "Your dance in the courtyard, " "your bursting laughter, " "your brothers will miss..."

Aunt, husband, brother-in-law, it doesn't matter Forget the veil, give me your hand Actually, I can tell the aunt's ailment by checking her niece's pulse | see This pulse seems familiar | feel I have seen this hand before You haven't felt the hand yet. You will feel it soon Lady, you sound familiar I know even your underwear You could be my nanny...? - Not nanny But I know what games you are trying to play It's you! It's not actually what you understand You mustn't suspect anyone like this Actually, the doctor sat me up here to take care of the patients Where's the doctor then? - I sent him to manage my hotel Be brave My brother-in-law is going to face music from now on Why? - What you earn, is lost Boy married, is boy lost. - I'm also married. What have I lost? You lost your mind. - Why? Before marriage, he'd buy bangles. After marriage, not even a nose-stud Brother is useless, bhabhi. I'll slave for Mutto And you'll do the household chores. - Really? See my sandals? Guests Brother, they are here Why didn't you die before falling in love with Sukhi's brother? | even dreamt of killing that man's shadows And today you made me stand face to face with him! Do you know what your lover's brother did to your aunt? First he wooed her Then he spurned her In arage, I married her off toarich man Later I found out that the bastard was already married | tolerated it But God knows how the swine learnt about her relationship with Sukhi He started taunting my sister She couldn't take it, and she killed herself Now tell me, Mutto, who killed my sister? The one I married her off to? No Mutto, he's not her killer. It's the one who spurned her. Sukhi! And you think I'll marry you off into that family?

And my love is meaningless to you? In his eyes, you are important, so is our love That's why he's closer to my heart than you are If Papa marries me off elsewhere, will you forget me? The answer to this question lies in the clutches of destiny I can't tell you anything now What are you doing? Your daughter has left the house, now are you calling the cops in? What else can I do? -She left in the night God knows if she'll return or not She's back this time. What if she doesn't return the next time? Those who reasoned with her and sent her back must be decent folks Thank God our honour is safe Often we fail to understand... the shades destiny gives to our lives Your past has come back in the way... of your little brother's love... that all the roads seem to be blocked I don't understand what obstacle to break The obstacle will go The walls will fall Channi is the last of my responsibilities | shall even give up my life for the sake of his happiness What are you saying, Sukhi?
