Is he forcing you to give me up? I asked you if he's forcing you to give me up. Don't kid yourself. He's never done that. You want to hide the truth til the end? Fine, but I know you're doing it for my sake. And I'll get to the bottom of it. You haven't changed, DA Lee. You wait and see, Mr. Byun. Mong-ryong, stop. You're just making this harder on me. He's the one who's making it harder on you. Why don't you stop torturing her and go home. See him off, and come inside. I'll make sure it's over between him and me. You know I can't be with him. You should leave. What are you doing? Carry this photo from now on. What? It's a new and improved one. I was pretty cool before, but I'm even cooler now. So look at that one from now on. You're such a joke. You like me so much. It'd be a shame for me to refuse you. So I'll try to like you too. Hey, Lee Mong-ryong. I never said I like you. Listen to this woman. The proof is staring right at me. What proof? Sung Choon-hyang. I'm a pretty well-known prosecutor. You want me to prove it to you? The defendant's denying her feelings for Lee Mong-ryong. I will prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. First piece of evidence, this photo. What is this a photo of? My wedding. This was found with your financial papers. Your nickname is ''Money Grubber,'' is it not? Yes. How many times a day do you look at your financial papers? About 20... So you look at this photo 20 times a day? By any chance, is it because you miss the marriage? I was just looking at money, my favorite thing. Same difference. You're a dead woman! Order in the courtroom! Next piece of evidence, the cell phone. Didn't you look at the photo of Lee Mong-ryong and cry your eyes out every night? No, never. One of your workers has seen you. Who? I'd like to know who. No one will testify out of fear of the defendant. You keep denying everything. Then why did you secretly drop by his place a week ago? I was just passing by. Isn't it because you wanted to get a glimpse of him? No. Explain this scrap book with articles about him. He was such a lousy student. So I collected them as oddities. Will you keep lying to the court? You're such a joke! Order in the courtroom! You keep denying everything. So let me ask the defendant directly. You really don't like me? Look me in the eyes. If you don't answer until I count to three, it means you like me. One, two, three! That's what I figured. Hey, Lee Mong-ryong. Now that I know, I can return to Seoul. You have to talk with Byun now. Please don't do this. You're making it harder on me. Don't even think about running away. I could bar you from leaving the country. And you know all your employees are on my side. Good night. Since it hurts me so much, can you not let me go? He's the one who's making it harder on you. Mong-ryong, what am I going to do? I can't be with you... So what am I going to do? Ms. Sung, you should've done it long ago. It isn't like you to be so coy. What are you guys talking about? Mong-ryong told us everything. You confessed you like him. Since you confessed, you might as well beg and plead with him. - It's not like that... - He's such a nice guy. He'll take you back if you plead with him. If you like him, forget your pride. Lee Mong-ryong, why you... Did you find Oh Mi-young, the alleged victim from back then? Yes, we did. Where is she? It's a good thing we sent Oh Mi-young abroad. Mong-ryong's looking high and low for her. Keep him at bay. She's Byun's puppet. Byun already got to her. Find the investigation records from then? Yes. There was this one strange matter. It concerned the security cameras. Of the five cameras in the parking lot, only the one at the site of the crime wasn't operating. That footage would've cleared you. The very opposite could've happened. It was a setup. That footage would've finished me. And Kang Min would've become an even bigger star. Sir, Mr. Park from Hit Productions is here. Mr. Byun. Our lead actor, Kang Min, is all the rage in Japan. Our Japanese investors are very pleased. Mr. Park. Before we finalize the co-production contract, I'd like to clarify some things. Who are these people in Japan? Why does it matter as long as we get the money? And besides, we have to grease some palms if this movie's going to be a hit. I'll talk to some high-ranking people, so don't worry about the promotion part. We don't want any behind-the-scenes PR work. The authorities seem to be onto something. Please be careful. Find out who Hit's Japanese investors are. Why does that matter? We just need to make the movie with their money. Sir. We've found the source of Hit Production's funds. Where is it? It's a syndicate based in Tokyo. Yakuza, I see. You're a dead man, Byun. Remember that his fate is still in my hands. Make the deposit for me. I have to go to Seoul. Are you going to see Mong-ryong? Make sure you look really nice. I'll be back today. It's all right. Stay a few days. I'll take care of everything. I said I'll be back today! You're not being shy now that I know how you feel. Are you investigating Dodo by any chance? - Yes. - Lee Mong-ryong! I'm hungry. Let's talk over lunch. Why are you investigating them? Why do you want to mess with Mr. Byun? Why are you so worried? It's my job. I lock up criminals. This is my job. If they're innocent, they needn't worry. This is my first meal today. Let me finish eating. Why are you skipping meals? You're showing your concern for me freely now. I'm not concerned... What's wrong? Are you sick? I'm all right. This happens once in a while. What's wrong? Must be some inflammation. I should be used to it by now. Then you should see a doctor. I have no time. Let's go. I'll take you back. We can't go anywhere. I'll get you some medicine. Here you go. 3 minutes and 10 seconds? That was so fast. And the pharmacy's far from here too. Thus the power of love. You pulled a fast one on me? I really was feeling sick. I'll take you to the airport. You'd better take a plane. No thanks. I'm not going to Busan. I'm staying at Da-ni's for a few days. Why? To see me everyday? I'm rather busy though. What a joke! I'm here on business. Bye. Look after yourself, all right? Sir, we've found the reason why Dodo Production's movie is being so heavily promoted. - They greased some palms. - Yes, sir. Look into their accounts. Make sure to track down their stock activities as well. Yes, sir. Mr. Park, you shouldn't have done this. You must know the authorities are onto us. Don't be so petty. I'll handle it. Just focus on making the movie. I don't work like this. Let's forget this contract. What? Then what about Kang Min? He's the reason I was able to get the funds. And you want to renege? Find another actor and produce a movie yourself. I don't want any part of this. But sir, we'll lose money as well. If you're doing this because of DA Lee, we have something that'll tie his hands. I'm not here on business. I just wanted to see how your baby's doing. Be honest. You're here because of Mong-ryong, right? No. I heard he's been investigating Dodo. Is it because of Mr. Byun? There's something more to that incident from before, right? No, not at all. Mong-ryong's still not over me. Then why did you leave Mr. Byun? There were reasons. Let's not get into it. Mong-ryong worries you, but not Mr. Byun, right? He used to be such a great gentleman. But his obsession for you has changed him. True... He's like a different person. What's this thing called love? I feel bad for Mr. Byun. After all, you're responsible for him changing. You were so cold to him. Is this about Mong-ryong again? Afraid I'll hurt him somehow? I'm sorry, Mr. Byun... Your love for me... the pain I caused you... I never paid attention. I just ignored you. I apologize. I've never expected anything from you. That's why I feel even worse. You cannot want or expect anything from me. My heart's filled with love for only one man. I don't care. I'll wait. I'll hold onto you and wait. I'll wait as well. For you to return to your old self. I won't run away. I'll wait. My, I am so sorry. You almost got into an accident. - Who the heck are you guys? - You must be DA Lee Mong-ryong. My boss has a message for you. You work for Hit Productions? Your recent actions have our boss chagrined. He'd like to give you a warning. Thankfully, nothing happened tonight. But if you keep it up, you'll have a huge accident. Excuse me. Hey there, penguins! Yes, you guys. Make your warnings simple and clear. ''Keep your nose out or you die.'' Tell your boss this. I'll keep sticking my nose in it till I'm dead. That DA has got mush for brains. If you're doing this because of DA Lee, we have something that'll tie his hands. Go get Baek right now. Yes, sir. Mr. Baek! Have a seat. How did you spend that money? Was it not enough? - No, sir... - I see. About what you said yesterday regarding that DA... I'd like to hear the details. Well, about that... I thought our discussion over the co-production was over. Take a look at this, and then we'll talk. I didn't realize this was what made Kang Min a star... You had a copy of the tape? I didn't keep it to do something like this... He learned these tricks from you. But why would you hold onto something like this? You could make Kang Min a bigger star. And you'd bury that annoying DA as well. What is it that you want? Let's work together again, Mr. Byun. With this tape, this movie will be a huge hit. You should really think it over. If you don't do it, I will. Yes, sir. Prepare to make a copy of the tape. Yes, sir. Sir, a delivery for you. I wonder what it is... Sir, this is the video... Byun, this is what you've had all along? Dong-soo, everything's okay there? Not to worry. By the way, you received a package. A package? It's from Dodo Productions. It's a videotape. A tape? Sir, DA Lee is here to see you. Mr. Byun. Did you send this tape to Mong-ryong too? Yes. He was just here. Are you trying to blackmail me with this tape? Yes, I am. It's the only way I can separate you two. You think I'd go to you if you destroy him? You think she'd go back to you if you destroy me? Whether the tape is released or not depends on you. Release it if you want! I'm not afraid. It's time for you to let Choon-hyang go. What you really want is me. Please leave Mong-ryong alone. You can give up everything for love? You don't care about your own life? Your manipulation of us ends right here. I love her. So I'm never giving up. I'd risk my life to protect Mong-ryong... ...because I love him. I'll leave right now. So please don't hurt him. If he gets hurt, it'll kill me. What's happened to all of us? Me... Mong-ryong... And you as well... I knew you'd do this again. Where will you run away to this time? Mong-ryong. Unpack your bags, and let's talk. As long as I'm not with you, things will be okay. He won't release that tape then. I just have to leave you. So you're going to leave me again? You saw the tape. People won't be interested in finding out the truth. Once it is released, Kang Min will become a hero. And you... You... I'd be branded as some psycho rapist. I wouldn't be able to practice law. I probably wouldn't be able to step out of my house. I'd be finished. How can you say that so casually? I realize it too. But you believe me. Don't you? That's all that matters. I won't end up like that, if only for your sake. So just trust me, and stay with me. Mong-ryong, let's leave each other. It's too hard for both of us. I guess we weren't meant for each other in this life. We just don't fit. Don't say that. Don't even think about running away. I'll find you no matter where you go. Your manipulation of us ends right here. I love her. So I'm never giving up. I'd risk my life to protect Mong-ryong... ...because I love him. I'm home. Hi. Can we talk? Sure. Are you eating regularly these days? Yes. Is this latest investigation about Byun? It's not based on any personal vendetta. I'll keep my personal affairs separate from my duties. Do you know what he has on you? Yes, I do. And you're confident? Don't worry. I'll get him back. Okay. Anything? Yes, we looked into Hit Production's finances. There were large bribes made under the guise of PR work. And there have been some stock distributions as well. - What about Dodo Productions? - They're surprisingly clean. And that movie they're co-producing with Hit, they haven't signed a contract yet. Proceed with Hit Productions first. Look into the finances of all the peripheral characters. And question their employees as well. Yes, sir. I don't have a good character. Tell me where you got that money. Tell me now while I'm being nice! I don't want to stay all night up because of you. Lee Mong-ryong. If I get my hands on him... There's been a huge media uproar. It'll affect the upcoming movie's image as well. You're just going to stand there and watch? If you don't do it, we'll release that tape. Why don't you release the tape? It'll be a chance to solidify my star status. Call a press conference. What are they going to announce? It's about the assault case that made Kang Min a hero. We've had a dry spell. I'd thank the Lord for a story like that. Byun Hak-do. Try it if you can. Mr. Byun, you can't. Ms. Sung, can you slow down? We'll have an accident. The reason we've asked you to gather today is to release some evidence regarding an incident that involved Kang Min a few years ago. There's a rumor about a videotape of the incident. Is it true? Yes, it is. Mr. Kang's feats seem even more heroic on footage. But isn't that other person DA Lee Mong-ryong? Yes, it is. Mr. Kang, could you tell us what happened? Yes. At the time... Excuse me. There's some additional footage. Would you play this? As you can see, this incident was staged in order to make a star out of Kang Min. These tapes will be confiscated and destroyed. I apologize for the inconvenience. Why did you stage such an incident? How will you handle the onslaught of criticism? I have nothing to say except that I'm sorry. Mr. Byun, why did you do that? I realized that there are some things I just cannot have. You've lost so much. It's the price I pay for having tortured you. I probably won't see you again. You can go back now. Mr. Byun... I hope that you'll find happiness in the future. Who would've imagined he'd do such a thing? Anyway, everything turned out well. Everything's fine now. Just be happy with each other. Mr. Bang Ji-hyuk, you're even better looking in person. Can I get an autograph? Sure. Where? Right here. What are you doing now? I smell a little cause I haven't taken a bath for a long time. What a long roundabout trip we've had. Yes. We got married 10 days after we met. But it took us a long time to get back together. When will you come back to Seoul? Why would I come to Seoul? Seoul is where your husband is. And who's my husband? Will you stop playing coy? We should get remarried. Personally, I'm in no rush. But you can't bear to be apart from me. What a joke! Choon-hyang, you're so bad... Byun Hak-do, you jerk. How dare you backstab me! It's not just a matter of Kang Min's career ending. The authorities want to investigate our finances. Sir, we got a call from the Japanese investors. They're demanding a huge annulment penalty. I shouldn't have brought in those guys. You! You must know. You must know Byun's biggest weakness. You must know... Ms. Sung, are you that happy? Pardon? And you put on a front all that time? So will you move to Seoul now? Well, I don't know yet. Is he crazy or what! What's going on? What the heck... Wait, let's talk. Put me through to DA Lee. We have the arrest warrants. - Get ready. - Yes, sir. Come any closer, and you're all dead. What kind of a broad is this? - She bit me like five times. - Come on! Our boss has got some guts... But isn't she too strong? What the heck is that girl? So you're weak when it comes to women. I had no idea the mighty Byun Hak-do had this side to him. Where is she? Don't be in such a rush. Sit down, and we'll talk business. What do you want? It's about that contract to co-produce the movie. Why don't you reconsider? Your investments are coming from the Yakuza. I have no interest in making a movie with their money. Doesn't matter. You want in or not? I guess I have no choice right now. The bribes you made under the guise of PR work and the stocks you've redistributed... What will you do about them? You're a man of ability. What about the sharing of profits? I understand there was an assault last time. Oh, that? My credo is that might triumphs over words. And over the law as well. In fact, might rules the world. That's my credo. Mr. Park. You're under arrest for racketeering. Under arrest? Me? For what? I have an arrest warrant. And there's plenty of evidence as well. You scumbags! Where's Choon-hyang? She's in the building somewhere. Ms. Sung, be careful! It's okay. Come any closer, and I'll jump. Make sure they don't escape. You guys, that way. And you guys, that way. What's that? Be careful! Choon-hyang! Mong-ryong! I guess we weren't meant for each other in this life. Choon-hyang... Do you still refuse to accept my love? There's someone else who resides in my heart. So I have no room in my heart for you, Magistrate. Even if I kill you? Even if you kill me... There's nothing I can do. - Are you all prepared? - Yes, sir! Choon-hyang, wait just a little while. I'm coming to save you. Choon-hyang! My husband... Kill me. It's time for you to back down. I'd rather that you kill me. I cannot attain your love in this life... I will attain your love in the next life. In this life or the next... I have no love to give you. The only one for me... ...is my husband. Mong-ryong... Mong-ryong... Lee Mong-ryong... Mong-ryong, wake up... Lee Mong-ryong! Lee Mong-ryong! What the... You scared me. Sung Choon-hyang, don't you have any fear? Lee Mong-ryong, you're such a dummy. Is it true that there is an inflow of Yakuza's money? Why do you kidnap Ms. Sung Choon-hyang? MAN OF JUSTICE LEE MONG-RYONG DA LEE TRACKS DOWN ORGANIZED CRIME Hey, Mong-ryong. Hey. How did our busy DA make time for me? You're mad because I haven't had time for you? You just miss me so much. What a joke. Not me. Take care of everything in Busan? I left everything to Dong-soo. I should get ready to go study abroad. What? You're leaving again? Now that I have money, I have to study. I'm old already. No way! You can't go! Why not? It's up to me. I'll forget my DA job. Take me with you. What a joke. First, marry me. And after having about three kids, you can go. Well... Run to that clock tower and back in 10 minutes. And I'll reconsider. I can't wait 10 minutes. - Will you marry me or not? - What? Will you or won't you? - Want me to kiss you again? - I will. I'll marry you. He's already more than 10 minutes late. We've waited more than 10 years for this day. What's another 10 minutes? Ten minutes? No, I can't wait! Come here now, or I'm leaving. Mong-ryong, you're a dead man. Thanks to these cases popping up, I can't even get married. I'll just get out here. Mong-ryong's still not here? Wait til he gets here... He's a dead man. Congratulations. And a belated congratulations on your engagement. He hasn't changed at all... Come on, hurry up. What were you doing? How can you be late today? I'm so sorry. They're fighting til the very end. What were they to each other in their former lives? Who knows? How can you be late on a day like today? There was so much traffic... Could we meet as husband and wife in the next life as well? Even in the next life, we'll recognize each other at first sight. Please don't ever leave me again. I do promise. I'll never leave you again. Sung Choon-hyang. Leave me again and you die. Lee Mong-ryong. Just behave. You're such a joke. Even when this life is over. Even when the next life begins. Forever. Forever. You and only you, forever. I will love you.
