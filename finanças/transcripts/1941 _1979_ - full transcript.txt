Last year in Africa, it took General O'Connor and his British tanks two months... to grab Libya and it took Rommel 12 days to get it back.

Anybody who wears a shirt like that is askin' for it. He's an American, Sitarski. If it's one thing we don't want, it's seeing Americans fighting Americans. I won't stand for that. Not here, not anywhere. We've had our chow. Move out. - You okay, kid? - You're not gonna tip him, are ya, Sarge? - That's okay. I don't need your tip. - I think you do. Get rid of that shirt.

Two squadrons of Japanese Zeroes-- [ Man ] The Japs tried to bomb San Francisco last night. Two squadrons of Jap Zeroes. I've been trackin' them ever since. I lost them somewhere over Fresno. [ Man ] Radio says that's not true about San Francisco. - It was just a case of war nerves. - War nerves? - Yeah. - Who said, "war nerves"? I heard it on that radio there. - Radio's wrong. - [ Woman ] Oh, my God! Oh, shit! Oh! Stop that plane! Stop! Stop! Damn it! Stop! [ Sirens Wailing ] Madness. It's the only word to describe it. This isn't the state of California. This is a state of insanity. [ Woman ] General Stilwell, Colonel Grant suggests dispatching... guard units to all the city reservoirs. Intelligence suspects that Fifth Columnists are going to... "pour poison into the water supply." And G-2 should pour knockout drops into the water supply. Maybe the people of the city would calm down and leave the war to the Army. [ Sirens Wailing ] Here he comes! - You have a telegram from Colonel Maddox, sir? - Madman Maddox? - What does he want? - Troops, sir. Troops? It's a practice bombing range in Barstow in the middle of the desert. What's he want troops for? Give me that. "Request emergency troops. Invasion imminent. Suspect hidden Jap airfield in Pomona alfalfa fields." I blame myself. I put that lunatic out there. Jesus H. Christ, DuBois. Is that the General's new secretary? Yes, sir. She came in from G-2 this morning. - Not bad, huh? - Not bad? She's a goddess. A goddamn goddess! That is Donna Stratton. I knew her back in Washington. She has got this thing for planes. One of those real high-flyin' types, huh? I've never seen anything like it. She's got planes on the brain. His brother had all those political connections in Georgia. What could I do? Tell him to hold his position. I'll send someone up there later . [ Stilwell ] Where's Birkhead? He's supposed to have my lunch. [ Donna ] B-17. [ Gasps ] Ooh. No man has ever gotten to first base with her on the ground. But get her into a plane, she'll bat your balls right out of the park. - You can fly, sir? - Who said anything about flying? I just gotta get her into that plane. I'll fake the rest. - [ Gasps ] - Hello, Donna. Donna Stratton, after all this time. How long has it been? Not long enough. You're not still sore, are you, Donna? Yes! ln a number of places. [ Laughing ] Same old Donna. Listen, I got a great idea. Why don't we get together for dinner tonight? We got a lot to talk about. [ Laughing ] What could you and I possibly have to talk about? Airplanes. I seem to recall that you always had a very keen interest in aircraft. Now, take this B-17, for example. A woman like you is bound to appreciate a plane like the 17. After all, it's big. It's the biggest one here. You know what else? It's got a lot of range. - You know what I mean by range, don't you? - Oh, sure. It can stay up for a long time. A very long time. It's built firm and solid. It has to be, because of its tremendous forward thrust. And when this baby delivers its payload, devastating. [ Both Laughing ] - Oh, Captain. Let's get something straight. - Please do. I don't like you. I don't like the way you act. I especially don't like your immature sexual innuendoes. - I was just kidding. - The B-17 happens to be... - the most valuable strategic air bomber... - Damn it! - When I went to flight school, we were taught to secure these. - in the United States Air Corps. I didn't know you went to flight school. I only logged in a couple of hours in a little Beechcraft Trainer... before I got kicked out-- upstairs to become the General's aide. - But can you fly the B-17? - B-17? - Can you fly the B-25? - A plane's a plane. - Can you fly the 24 Liberator? - Propeller and four wings. Can you fly the 38 Lightning? You can fly one, you can fly them all. Sure, I could fly the 17. I'm sorry, Captain. I didn't realize you had a serious interest in strategic bombers. Donna, my interest is very strategic. How would you like me to show you the cockpit? [ Airplane Passes Overhead ] Uh-huh. I'm lost. [ Murmurs ] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oooh!

Nothing to worry about. Objectives in sight. We peer down the bomb sight. We're on target. We open the bomb bay doors.

Sorry to have to bail out, Loomis, but it just won't work on the ground. I tried it in the simulator once. It was no good there either. We've got to be airborne. But, Donna, listen. We'll try a different flight plan. We are divebombing Tokyo. [ Imitating Automatic Gunfire ] I'd like to say one final word about bombs. The eventuality of an air raid on this city is highly unlikely. Oh, Donna. You can't do this to me. You don't know what I've been through today. Loomis, my father was a drill sergeant in the Marine Corps. He taught me how to defend myself. Now, leave me alone.

Shortly before 10:00 p.m., police reported... that an airplane had been shot down into the La Brea Tar Pits. - [ Snoring ] - In other parts of the city, Fifth Column acts were reported during the air raid. - Mysterious lights were spotted in many locales. - [ Car Approaching ] In the Tarzana hills, Burbank police... saw a string of lights in a "V" form, pointing toward the Lockheed Aircraft plant. [ Officer ] All right, fall in the yard! Fall in the yard, men! Foley, Jones, Reese, Hinshaw! Ten-hut! [ Newscaster ] ...and immediately Army searchlights shot into the sky. Sergeant, what happened here? Sir, while suppressing a riot on Hollywood Blvd. Iast night with our tank, I... was, uh, struck unconscious. My men, however, received a report about a Japanese sub... off the Santa Monica Pier from a downed Army Air Corps captain. They responded immediately, went to the objective and at about 2300 hours... - they engaged the enemy. - Damage? Uh, the Japanese sunk both our tank and, uh, the ferris wheel, sir. I think we hit the sub. I saw it go down! [ Wally ] You see, sir, l-- - [ Sighing ] - Donna! Donna! Donna! Not now! Oh, honey. - My girlfriend was there-- There was this wild man-- - Is this a long story? - Yes, sir. - Then save it. Sir, I'd like to say something. We've been through a lot, all of us. We faced the enemy for the first time last night, right in our own backyards, and we came together, put our differences aside and carried on the true spirit of America. I think no matter what happens, what sacrifices we have to face, we can carry forward like Americans. While we're doing our repairs, I'm going to hang this wreath on my front door. This symbol of Christmas, this symbol of peace. I just want to remind us all that we're not going to let... a bunch of treacherous enemy killjoys... ruin our Christmas. [ Rumbling, Creaking ] - [ Gasping ] - [ Squeaks ] Boy, that's great! [ Joan Whimpering ] What? [ People Shouting, Arguing ] - [ Shouting Continues ] - You're gonna need tanks for the Burma road, sir. I'm just a sergeant, but I'm a great mechanic. You know, this year wasn't the big year of the war, '41. I think the really big year is going to be 1942. - [ All Shouting ] - Let go of me! [ Shouting Continues ] It's gonna be a long war. [ Shouting, Arguing Continue ] [ Foley ] Let me go! Let me go! [ Shouting, Arguing Continue ] Oh! Open the door! Whoa-ohhh! [ Shouting ln Japanese ] [ Laughing ] That is the craziest son of a bitch I ever saw. [ Screaming ] Torpedo! It was on that radio there! Ohhhh! Jesus Christ, it's a sub! Look, you guys, a Jap sub! I can't beat you in a fair fight. [ Explosion ] [ Airplane Approaching ] Back! Back! They're rioting in the street, sir. Whoa-aah! Let's get outta here! [ Screaming ] Hi, Stretch! Close, Ward. Close. That reminds me. Kill them cockroaches in that flour sack. - Look at that! - [ People Shouting ] There goes Dad! Kill a few Krauts for me, huh?
