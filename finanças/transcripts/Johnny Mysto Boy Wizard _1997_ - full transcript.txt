(MultiCom Jingle) (suspenseful music) (hooves pounding) - [Soldier] We mustn't go back empty handed! - [Soldier] There's a stone clearing! Up ahead! - [Soldier] I see her! - [Soldier] Don't let her escape! - [Soldier] There she is! (shouting) - You, look over there. - [Soldier] You men, over there! - [Soldier] This way! - [Soldier] There are tracks here! - [Soldier] She can't escape! (suspenseful music) (panting) - [Soldier] There's nothing there! - Do you see anything? (horse whinnying) (soldiers shouting) - I don't see her! - You two, take the back! - [Girl] Merlin, Merlin! - [Soldier] Any sign of her? - [Soldier] Where is she? - [Soldier] Cha! (dramatic music) - [Girl] I brought it, Master Merlin! - You've been running! - The Devil Soldiers are everywhere. No place is safe. - Come child, sit by the fire. (crow cawing) (crow cawing) Oh, the Glass of Babylon. I bid thee wait! By the rune that is Lithil I bid thee wake. By the rune that is blood, I bid thee wake. By the power of fire and ice, by the power of steel and storm! (eerie ringing) (rumbling) By the power of the most ancient, I bid thee wake! (magical thundering) (gasping) (crow cawing) And open the way to he who will save us! To the unborn child! (eerie humming) (magical zapping) (eerie humming) (thunderous booming) (mystical humming) (girl gasping) (man gasping) Sprout! Bear the mirror to the place of safety, and take care, all depends upon it now. - Shall we be saved, then? - Our only hope, lies in the hands of a hero, Who may not be born, for 1000 years. (magical ringing) (dramatic music) - Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, here's Johnny! (audience applauding) - Thank you, thank you. Welcome one and all, thank you. And now Assistant, the pitcher of water, please. Is this pitcher full of water? - Water. - Now Assistant, please may I have the newspaper? Now observe! And... (kids laughing) (water splashing) And now the, the magic ring! - Mysto, you did that one already. - Oh, yes, so yeah. And now, the... The, the rabbit out of the hat! - Aw man, this is stupid, let's get out of here. - Come on, guys, rabbit out of the hat! An oldie but a goodie! Hey, I promise it'll work! - Hey, it's better than last time, right? - Yeah I guess. - Come on, they're a bunch of jerks, anyway. Let's go catch a flick, have some fun, right? - I gotta go work on my disappearing cabinet trick. - Hey Johnny, how do you get the water out of this thing? (melodramatic music) - Uh-hmm. Yeah, yes, I did my homework. Um, Glen's over, okay? Thank you. Yeah, how's the Grand Canyon? All right, well, I'll talk to you later, okay? I love you too. Bye. - Oh, did you hang up on your mother? - Yeah. - I wanted to talk to her. Get cleaned up, dinner's almost ready. - Could we just wait five minutes, Blackmoor's on! - Oh, magic, magic, always magic! You should play soccer like I did when I was your age! - Okay Rose. - Thank you, thank you! - Wish I had an assistant like that! - As you can see, this cabinet has no place to hide. And now my dear, step into the cabinet. (assistant grunting) - [Assistant] Bring me back! - [Blackmoor] In... And we'll say the magic word, - Spin, you are, spin... - Tomaru, tomara, tomaru tomara-- - Hey, that's from Barney! - Shh! - And spin, and voila! Thank you! Ah, and now, - Amazing! - Spin in the opposite direction! - He's the best! - and if you-- - Yeah if he's the best, how come he's on cable access? - Politics! - What? - The other magicians are jealous! - Tomaru, tomaru! - I can't figure it out! Is she still inside the box or did she get out somehow? - Why don't you just go and ask him? - Yeah right, like he'd tell me! You know magicians don't tell their secrets. - Of course they do, what do you think, they learn it over and over again? No, they tell each other! Professional to professional. And you're a professional, colleague! A fellow magician, he'll tell you. - Yeah, I am a colleague aren't I? (rattling) Oh man! Got any more bright ideas? - [Glenn] Hey hey, hey hey! - [Johnny] Good! Come on! - Honey for goodness sake! I mean we've gone through this so many times now it's getting late! Now this is for the last time please, get it right this time, it's very simple! When I come out with this blue cloth with the silver stripes on it, I want you to use camera number one from the back, you understand? Then you switch to camera two, for this swing out part, the next trick will be with the cane! You can take this again, with camera number one, from way in back. (fantastical music) - Mm, hmm, oh! (clapping) - And now Harry, we're going to do this week's new attraction, the great illusion! (rattling) Ah! - It's stuck again! (grunting) - That's it Harry, that's it! I've had it, going back, no more do you hear me? (Assistant whimpering) - [Assistant] Sid! - Um, Mr. Blackmoor, excuse me. - Who, are you? - This is Glenn, and I'm, I'm Johnny Mysto, I'm a magician. - Yeah, well congratulation. - Sid? Sid? - Yeah yeah yeah! (Assistant whimpering) - Go! - I-I just wanted to say that I think you're the greatest magician in the world. (screaming) - Stupid thing, oh... Take a break nah, take two breaks, they're small! (grunting) (slamming) Abracadabra! (sighing) - Mr. Blackmoor? - Hey look kids, I'm not in the mood for autographs today, ok, do you mind? What's the matter, you deaf? - I, I don't want your autograph Mr. Blackmoor. I mean, it's not that I don't want it, it-it, it's just, that that's not why I came. Um, you see, I'm a magician. - A fellow magician. - Look could we speed this up a bit huh? - Uh, well I was trying to duplicate the disappearing cabinet trick and, and well I, I just can't get it right and I, I was wondering if-- - Wondering what? How I did it? - Well, I know magician's never tell their secrets, but... - Ah but a has-been like me, just might make an exception, huh? - No! It-it's just-- - You want to know my secrets? Here, here, take this! It's all in there! - What is it? - What is it, it's the magic book! It's Lampsten Supply Warehouse, where you make somebody disappear, levitation, saw a woman in half, if the magic trick was ever on the stage, it's in there! Take it! - Thanks. - Sid, Sid? - Uh? - I'm sorry I bothered you. I still think you're the greatest magician in the world. Come on Glenn. - No wait a second. (clearing throat) (tense music) - Hey look kid I'm sorry, I... I tell 'ya I had a really bad day today, you know how it goes. - Yeah, yeah I know. - Listen, hold on, hold on, let me find something special for 'ya huh? You know, every, every magician, every real magician anyway they, they know a secret. - What? - Well you know we all know that magic is uh, illusion you know? Just trickery, huh? But I tell you something, if you do a trick long enough and, and hard enough, work at it, you can feel it inside, you know in your heart, and suddenly something happens. It turns to wonder, you know? And then you'll discover, a real secret. Here. Tell you what, I want you to have this. Oh this is, this is, this is old. In fact it's ancient. - What is it? - Well it's a bit that this here is a, take it it's, it's the, it's the secret ring of uh, of uh... - Astarte. - I was just gonna say that, Astarte. Now if there was ever a magic in anything, it's in that ring. So, you take that home and put it on, and just see if you don't discover some, some real magic, huh? - Wow, this is great! Thanks Mr. Blackmoor. - Ah, don't mention it. From one magician to another. - Come on Glenn. - Hey, by the way, whatever happened to that uh, ox-cent that you had? (chuckling) - It disappeared like magic, wiseguy. Now scram! - I always thought that maybe you had some class. Mmm-hmm. - Yeah yeah yeah... (crickets chirping) (rumbling) (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) (hopeful music) (mystical whistling) (suspenseful music) (mystical whistling) (water splashing) (thunder rumbling) - It works, it works! - Hello, Johnny Mysto! Hey kiddo! - Oh, it's you! - What the heck? (suspenseful music) (carnival music) - Oh hey Glenn. Hey, Andrea, that's enough! - Okay! - Do you know what time it is? (mystical jingling) Oh hey, it's a quarter to one! Your watch. - How the heck did you-- - Look, it's ever since last night, I put the ring on! It is real magic! At least close enough for me! And ever since then they've worked, all my tricks have worked! - Wow Johnny, I see very big things in your-- Our, future! Picture this! Johnny Mysto, boy wizard, the world's youngest and greatest magician ever! Las Vegas, Hollywood, Network primetime, Letterman, Leno, I love that guy! (sighs) And I'll be your agent, deal! - Yeah, deal. (cheerful music) - You're not gonna regret this! Thank you, enjoy the show! Thank you, thank you. Enjoy the show. Hey, where's your ticket, admission's a dollar. - What, for this junk. - Yeah you know you're right, it is junk. Don't go. - I'll put it on my charge card! - Look, don't make me get rough. - Oh, and how you gonna get rough? (laughing) - I guess you guys haven't met Rose yet, have you? - Who's Rose? (comically brutish music) (thudding) (sighing) Bringing moms into it, boy that's low! - Admission's a dollar. - Pay him! - Thank you. Enjoy the show. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, enjoy the show. And now, the moment you've all been waiting for! The new, the improved, the one, the only, Johnny Mysto! (brassy music) - Thank you very much, and welcome, thank you! (applauding) And now, here we have an ordinary deck of cards! - Mysto man you're so bogus, this is so fake! - Did I hear someone say fake? - [Minions] Fake fake fake! - Assistant! Assistant! Kindly give me a personal object. - Huh? - You're lucky coin. - Hey! - Trust me. And here we have a coin, solid metal, no tricks. Now observe, it's metal. Hey Bunko, see the coin? (fingers snapping) (magical jingling) - Hey, my coin? - Andrea! - Johnny! - Relax! - [Bunko] What are you gonna do now, pull it out of my ear or something? - Look in your back pocket. - Whoa, ha! Thanks for the dough, Mysto! - I don't think so. (magical jingling) - Where'd it go? (magical jingling) What the... - Oh, by the way Bunko, (magical jingling) here's your skivvies! (children laughing) - I had a pair of those when I was three! (applauding) - And now for my next trick! Rabbit out of the hat! And now, rabbit, rabbit, show yourself! (magical jingling) (dramatic music) (clapping) (magical jingling) (audience giggling) (comical music) The trick, it wasn't supposed to work like that! - Who cares, look at them, they're loving it! What's next? - The cabinet? - Do it! And now, the grand finale of today's show! The disappearing sister! (applauding) - As you can see, all four sides open! No tricks, no secret panels, and no place to hide. Now assistant, please step inside. - Don't close me up! Please! - And now, toomaru, toomara! - Hey, isn't that from Barney? - Man, shut up! - Disappear, disappear! Disappear, disappear! (echoing) (suspenseful music) (applauding) (giggling) And now, observe! (suspenseful music) Toomaru, toomara! Toomaru, toomara! Reappear, reappear, reappear! (echoing) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) Well, um, I-I-I-I guess she decided to stay away for a while, so, um, if you guys want to see her reappear, you'll have to... You'll have to come back tomorrow, okay? - Thank you for coming! See you tomorrow! Same time same place same price! You can keep the rabbits, thank you very much! Hope you enjoyed the show. It was perfect, making 'em come back, that was great! - Look, i-it wasn't supposed to work that way! It wasn't a trick, I mean it was supposed to be but, you see there's these mirror strips right in there, and if you open them just right, you can hide her behind them, I mean that's the whole point, see? The assistant never actually leaves the cabinet! But, but, I mean she did it, s-s-s-she's gone, I mean, she actually disappeared! Aw man am I in trouble, come on I gotta try it again! - She's probably just in the bathroom, I mean girls go to! - Look she didn't just go to the bathroom! And, I didn't have 10 live rabbits in this hat! (groans) It's this ring! It doesn't just make the tricks work, it makes real magic! It made the rabbits appear, and now Andrea disappear! And now I can't get it off! - This is intense! - Look, it'll be dinner in two hours, we gotta go to Blackmoor's and maybe he can get Andrea back, okay? Come on let's go! (thunder rumbling) - Hey Mysto! (sinister music) I want to talk to you. - Look Bunko we're kind of in a hurry! - I got news for you, I want that buck back! - Don't you guys have anything better to do, like summer school? - It seems to me I got a buck coming! - So why don't you just go take a flying leap! (magical zapping) (screaming) (splattering) (dramatic music) - Ooh that's gotta hurt! Don't ask. (laughing) - Where's that Mysto? - Now I can't get it off, and I can't get Andrea back, and it's, it's gonna be dinner in around two hours! - Hey kid, what, we, we met someplace before now didn't we? - Look I was here a few days ago! You gave me this ring! - Oh, yeah yeah yeah, now I remember you! So, so what do you want, huh? - I want your help! - Forget it, he's plastered! - Look I can't forget it, he's our only hope! - He's so sauced! - Stop, sober up! (magical jingling) (dramatic music) (thumping) - What the-- What did you do? Uh, I'm sober! What a waste of cheap booze! - Look, it's this ring you gave me, it's real! It does real magic! You want another demonstration? - No no no no, please, I believe you. Come here, let me see that ring. (grunting) - I told you, it won't come off! - What are you looking for? - What do you think I'm looking for? I'm looking for a, the envelope that it came from. Ah, here it is. Nothing inside. But, there is the return address, Margaret Lattimer, 22nd East 100 Street. - But, I thought you said this ring was from Astarte? You said it had magical powers! - Hey look kid gimme a break, will 'ya? I mean I got all sorts of junk here! You know, all fan mail, amulets, dried monkey hearts, you name it! This was just one of them! So I thought. (tense music) Well, what are you waiting for? You want help don't you, let's go see that lady. And in the future, I'll thank you not to sober me up against my will. - Whatever. - Well, this is the place. What do you think, should we go inside? - Yeah why not. - Yeah why not. (tense music) Uh, excuse me! We're looking for Margaret Lattimer? - What do you want? - Well, we'd like to see Margaret Lattimer. (tense music) - [Woman] What do you want Margaret Lattimer for? - Look, lady, if you would just kindly bring Miss Lattimer out here I think I can explain. (chiming) (mysterious music) Where'd you get that ring? - Uh, he gave it to me. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Blackmoor the Magician. - Well I'll be damned, so you are! You sure have gone to seed. - Have we met before? - Um, I'll have an order of fries and a soda. - Please, we need your help! I used the ring! - You used the ring? You let him use the ring? - No no no no listen, I I I didn't exactly do that, you see, I mean how was I supposed to know, you know, uh, I mean why didn't you include a note or something, eh? In fact, why did you send it to me in the first place? - Eh, this is certainly interesting. Not how I thought things would turn out. - Look, the ring, it made my sister disappear! - Well I'm not surprised, that ring is ancient. It's full of power. It's been in my family for 1200 years, passed on from mother to daughter... - So, what are we're gonna do about it? - Well that's not the point, is it? - Isn't it? - Ah... We don't possess the ring anymore! The boy does! - Look, I'm sorry I messed around with the ring! If I'd known I wouldn't have put it on! (poignant music) All I want to do is get this off and get my sister back! I admit it's my fault, and I'm sorry! I just want to know if she's okay, if she's not hurt! - Come with me. (ominous music) (door clattering) - [Glenn] Cool! - Careful, careful! Careful. There we are... (clicking) (tense music) I'm sorry to say, there is no power on earth today, who can restore your sister or remove that ring. Its ways have been lost, forgotten maybe for 1000 years, but there is one hope, and it's a slim one. - I'll do whatever I have to. - The only way you can rescue your sister, is to find the first master of the ring. - Who's that? - The great wizard Merlin! - (laughs) Oh, please! - Is Merlin still around? - Of course not! You have to travel back in time! - Uh, back in time? - See the ring carries a destiny with it. And a prophecy that someday a hero will come and will claim the ring, and bring it back to its master. That path still exists, it's right here in this room! But, throughout all time, throughout all space, there is only one person who can find the way! - What if it isn't his destiny? - Well, that wouldn't be good news, would it? I like to think of what my grandmother used to say. Trust in tomorrow, for if it hasn't happened yet, it just may! (tense music) (laughing) - Swell. Guess that's supposed to be comforting. - Now, where the heck is it? - [Blackmoor] What you looking for, the Addams family? - I always meant to clean up this place but, but then i thought why, (magical chiming) it'll just get messier. Uh, the messier it gets, the easier it is to just, let it be. (magical chiming) (suspenseful music) (thumping) (grunting) - What's going on here? - Hey, hey! H-Help! - Stop fighting! (mumbling) Stop-- - Oh of course! M for magic scroll! (suspenseful music) - Whose hand print is it? - Some say that it's old Merlin's himself. No one knows for sure, but that's the way. Now, if you're the chosen one, your hand on that mark will draw you back into ancient times! - Wait a second, what about my sister Andrea? - What about her? - Look, you can cover for me, that's no problem, I mean you can just like write a note or something, put my name on it. But if Andrea doesn't come back for dinner, Rose is gonna go ape! And if she can't find her, she'll call the police and the fire department, and even my parents! - Do you have a personal object of your sister's? - No I don't think-- Wait a second, yeah, yeah, I got her lucky coin. - Uh-hmm! - Ah, what do you want me to do with it? - Give it to him. - Now what? - Now, he can use the power of the ring to change you into the likeness of his sister, you can take her place until the real one is found. - I can do what, no! - That'd be perfect! Look, you spend most of your time over at my house anyway! - Yeah I know but-- - And your parents will never know your gone a night! - Hey now, come on, that-- - And I won't be gone very long, it'll just be a day, maybe a couple days! - Couple of days? - I promise you I'll be back before my parents get back from the Grand Canyon! - The Grand Canyon! - Look, please promise you'll do this for me, I'm desperate! - Promise, no I-- - Thank you! Now what do you want me to do? - Point at him, and bid him change into the form of your sister! - No no come on guys, I did not promise anything! - Glenn, I bid you change into the form of my sister! - Now come on, can't we just give this a little thought, maybe we can just pretend Andrea's been, I don't know, hit by a car or something? Or maybe kidnapped? - Did you see that? Did you see that? Oh, imagine that act in Las Vegas, huh? And I just gave it away! - Something's wrong, something's missing! Why am I suddenly so short, and why am I dressed like ballerina? Johnny! - I will never ever ever be able to repay you for this! You better hurry, you wouldn't want to miss dinner. - Did you say dinner? - Yep, and they're having spaghetti and meatballs tonight. - Yeah you're right, okay I'll go. - Here, take these, they're from my private stock. You may need them. - You be careful on the stairs! - [Glen] Thanks, ow! - Now, are you ready to try your destiny? - I'm with 'ya all the way kid! (suspenseful music) (mystical whooshing) (mystical rumbling) (thunderous booming) (magical whooshing) (explosion crackling) - [Margaret] Godspeed young hero! (echoing) (crickets chirping) (owl hooting) (magical humming) (mystical bubbling) (mystical whooshing) (electric crackling) (mystical humming) (crickets chirping) (mystical energy humming) - Hey Mr. Blackmoor! Hey! - (groans) Oh, oh... (grunting) - I guess you meant it when you said, be with me all the way, huh? - I did? - Thanks. I can use all the help I can get. - Help? Help! - Whoa, look! Come on! - (chuckles) Oh my god! (tense music) (vigorous regal music) - Do you think Merlin's in there? - Oh sure, how should I know? Oh boy I hope this guy's friendly. - (chuckles) What have we here? Two plump pheasants for a cooking pot (chuckles)! Get them! Hi-yah! (horse whinnying) (dramatic music) - This way! - [Soldier] Let's go! (shouting) - This way, quick! - This way! (hooves pounding) - [Soldier] We can't let them escape! - [Soldier] This way! - What do we do now? - Look they're coming from over there too! (horse whinnying) - [Soldier] Spread out some more! - Follow me! - Come on, let's go this way! (perilous music) - [Soldier] Hey hold it, get down there too! - They're trying to cut us off! - [Blackmoor] Trying to? They are cutting us off! - Here let's go up! - Up where? - Up in the tree! - Ah come on kid, gimme a break will you! I haven't been up a tree in years! - Come on! - Let's go around here! - [Soldier] Let's lead the horses around! (guards shouting) (sinister music) (horse whinnying) (hooves pounding) - [Soldier] Go that way! Don't let them get away! - [Soldier] Spread out! Watch the road (mumbles)! (mumbling) (soldiers shouting) (cracking) - Oh, ah! (grunting) - Come on, come on, come on! (Blackmoor grunting) (whooshing) - Andrea! Andrea! Ah, there you are little cupcake! Nyum nyum nyum! Do you know where your brother is? Camping with Glenn, hmm. Well Andrea, can you picture this rolly-polly Glenn in a sleeping bag like a little stuffed sausage, hmm? But he should have told me before. I made enough spaghetti for four! - That's okay I'll eat it! - Andrea! (gasping) What happened to your voice? (coughing) - My voice, uh, I'm just a bit hoarse. - Hoarse? Do you have a temperature? - No, me and the guys, I mean, me and the girls were having a screaming contest. - Oh silly thing! You make yourself sound like a frog! Come, it's dinner-- - Okay! - Time? (comical music) - Don't worry, everything's fine. (whooshing) (dramatic music) (horse whinnying) - [Johnny] Come on! Come on! - [Soldier] Come on! - [Soldier] (mumbles) to the castle! - [Soldier] I'm ready let's go. - Okay? - I'm okay, believe it or not, I used to do a balancing act on chairs. Of course that was back when they called me The Great Ricardo. - Your name isn't really Blackmoor? - Nah. Sid Berkowitz. Let me tell you something about magic, kid. You don't just stand there doing tricks, you gotta, you gotta invent a new personality, a stage person you know, a whole other you! Then after a while, a strange thing happens. People get sick of you, you're no longer hip. Then you realize that, what people are looking at on the stage, this you that you've invented, he's all you got left. - I don't believe that. You've got the magic, you do the impossible. - I'm just a trickster, just a sort of, con man of the supernatural. - No, y-you get on stage, and people watch you, and they think, I don't know, they think that anything can happen. I believe that. - Yeah but you're not me kid. Now what do you say we get down out of here huh? My back is killing me. Let me see, I'm a little turned around here, now I know the soldiers went that way, and I think that the castle is back that way, so I say let's go that way, huh? (magical jingling) Don't get stuck to anything! (birds chirping) (pleasant music) - Come on we got to find Merlin. - No problem, just find me a phone book here huh (chuckles). - Hey uh, excuse me, we were wondering if-- - Eh, you be strangers? - Yeah. - Go, go! - Okay. - What, what was his problem? - I have no idea. (tense music) - Who be you, strangers? - I be Johnny Mysto, and this be-- - I'm Sydney Blackmoor. - I can see by your dress, you are not born to this land. But, if you come in peace, you're welcome. I feel though, we have little enough to offer you. Once this was a fine land. No longer, as you can see. It has grown sick. I fear that the dead, outnumber the living. - Excuse me can I ask you a question? Uh, I notice this really strong smell here. Haven't you people ever heard of sanitation? - We be simple folk here. We know nothing of such distant lands. We are plagued here stranger. The black sickness, little food, and less trust. But, so long as I am the elder, what we have, we share. - Hey wait a second. We have something to share with you too, here. Here, here, it's a gift. It's, it's food. Yeah, you eat it. No wait wait wait wait, you have to open it, just like that. There we go, there we go. It, it's good, it's, it's umm, umm, yummy! - Mmm. Tis true, it has a sweet savor. - Yeah, and almonds too. - I think you just invented tooth decay. (chuckling) Maybe not. - Soldiers, soldiers! The soldiers are coming! (dramatic music) The soldiers are coming, soldiers! (shouting) - Run, everyone! Run, run! - [Sprout] This way strangers, if you would live! (dramatic music) - I would! - Hurry, flip the table! Hurry now, hurry! Quick, inside, hurry! Quickly! (soldiers shouting) - Why are they searching for us? - Lord Malfeasor has to account for any stranger! (mumbles), no man, no maid, no wee child. The soldiers come out, and gather the people. The captives go in, but they do not come out again. None save Lord Malfeasor himself and the rogues that take his pay know their fate! - Who's this Lord Malfeasor? (soldiers shouting) (horse whinnying) - Where have you come from boy? Malfeasor was a knight, a powerful knight, and now he's called the Usurper. For four long seasons now he has ruled, and made the land sick by a black trick! He has imprisoned the king and queen in the dungeon of Camelot! - Camelot? The real Camelot? The king and queen, Arthur and Guinevere? - What of them? - If this guy's so evil, why would he bother keeping them prisoner, I mean, why not just like, like, chop of their heads, or like, do something like that? - So long as Arthur lives, those who are still true will seek to free him, and Malfeasor gathers those loyal men up as they come. However brave, they cannot stand against the power of the ring! - Listen, we need to find a wizard named Merlin. - Do yee now? Many's the man who'd like to find Merlin. - But without Merlin, I can't get my sister back! And I-I don't know what I'll do! - Shh! (tense music) Hush. - Well well well! (laughing) Here are our plumb pheasants, and a tiny little squab to go with them (laughes)! - Did your brother tell you anything about going on this trip, hmm? - Like what? - Where he was going, when he would be back. It was not good, he shouldn't go off without asking. And he has not called. I think I'll call Glenn's parents. - No! - Why not? - Well they're not home, they're camping with Glenn and Johnny, right? - Perhaps they've come home, I'll call and find out. (comically ominous music) Now, where is that number... - Got it! (telephone ringing) - Mysto residence, this is Rose. - [Glenn] Hi Rose this is Glenn. - Glenn, I was getting worried, where are you? - Uh, my parents took me and Johnny down to Lake Cashamont. Didn't Johnny leave you a note? - Yes yes but he did not say where he was, or when he would be back. Is he there, let me talk to him. - Um, well sorry, the phone is around half a mile from the lake, they're, they're at the lake. - Oh, well, and you walk a half mile to call me on the phone. - Actually the phone is at the general store, I was kind of hungry. - Oh, I see, all right. - Yes. - When are you going home? - When are Johnny's parent's coming home? - [Rose] Tomorrow afternoon. - Well, we'll be home by then. - All right, but you tell Johnny he should not go away without asking first. - Okay, I'll tell him, bye. - Bye. - Yes! (sighing) (doorbell ringing) - [Rose] Andrea? - Yeah? - [Rose] Come down here! - Yeah Rose? - Andrea, your little friends have come to play! - Hey Andrea, I brought over my doll! - [Girl] I brought my makeup one! - [Girl] I brought some doll clothes! - Oh man, what could be worse than this! (dramatic music) - Hey, take it easy will you? Just chill out, will 'ya? - You don't know who you're dealing with! - And who is that? - I am Blackmoor, Master of Magic! Observe! (magical jingling) (popping) (laughing) - That be fine kitchen magic. What else can you do, Master (laughs)? - Look, if you guys don't get out of here and leave us alone, you'll be in big trouble! (laughing) - Oh, trouble! - The boy's a magical master too (chuckles)! Take 'em, kill the girl! (tense music) - Don't make me do it! Look I mean it! Get lost! (magical jingling) - They have disappeared! - What happened? - Quickly, (mumbles). - Where are they? (soldiers shouting) (chuckling) (brooding music) (thumping) (clockwork ticking) - What troubles you My Lord? - I feel, as if something's stuck on my brain. As if my doom, was just writ down. Have you found the old man? - The search continues exalted one. But you need not concern yourself with Merlin, without his ring he can do no harm. - That's right. Perhaps I am a fool to worry about Merlin. (clockwork ticking) And again, perhaps you are a fool not to. Which do you think it is? (clockwork ticking) - Do you wish me to answer, My Lord? - I wish you to find him! He lives to plot, that one! I do not doubt he is plotting against me even now! (clockwork ticking) Find him! Find him! - In the name of Heaven, what did you do, where did they go? - (sighs) Look, I don't know, I mean, besides look, it's not me, that's doing it, it's this ring! - The ring! I did not believe when I saw it on your finger. Then it be true, just as Merlin said. You have brought it back from the after times! From the days that have not yet been! - We came from the 20th century. - Late in the 20th century. - I came back because I need Merlin's help! Do you know where he is? - I know, but it is he that needs the help! - Look, I accidentally made my sister disappear, and I need Merlin's help to get her back! - Merlin hoped for a hero, and instead the ring brings back a boy, and an old man. What hope do we have now? - Ah, excuse me? - Only the ring can fight the ring! Merlin used the last of his powers to open a door to the days that have not yet been, hoping that some future hero would bear the token back again, and defeat Malfeasor. - Great, and I'm what he got. Look, I'm no Schwarzenegger! What if we just give the ring to Merlin, and he can fight Malfeasor? - I will take you, tonight! He dwells in hiding now, deep in the tainted wood. - Sounds cozy. (brooding music) (vigorous resolute music) (suspenseful music) (crow cawing) - What is it old friend? (dramatic music) (crow cawing) (clockwork ticking) (dramatic music) Malfeasor has sent his toys to collect me. I should be honored. (clockwork ticking) - Merlin, a man who leaves his sign behind on every scroll he touches cannot expect to escape the hounds forever. - Once upon a time the hounds would have respected my privacy! (clockwork ticking) - No more tricks old man, and no more clever sayings. (grunting) (explosion exploding) - Andrea! (spitting) I just spoke to Glenn's parents. - My parents, I mean, Glenn's parents? - They don't know anything about a camping trip, but I think you do! - They forced me not to tell! They wanted to go camping but Glenn's parents wouldn't let 'em, so they went on their own, at Lake Cashamont! They're fine, I swear, but Glenn didn't want to do it, it was Johnny! Johnny forced him to go and then forced me not to tell! - I see this is very bad! I'm thinking of calling your parents! - You wouldn't want to ruin their vacation! And you can't call them anyway, there's no phone! - I'm telling you cupcake, I'm thinking of calling the police! - Oh no don't do that! They wouldn't be able to find them before morning, and they'll just be wasting their time! I swear, please! (whooshing) (tense music) - Are we almost there? - It's right around this way! Merlin, no! They've taken him, back to Camelot in chains! They've taken our last hope with him! Malfeasor will have cause to rejoice this night! - There's only one thing we can do! - Save ourselves! - Rescue Merlin! - But you're just a boy! - And you're just a girl. - I'm just a has-been entertainer! - Look, none of us is really hero material. But the three of us together, well, we can make one real hero! Besides, I've got the ring, it gives us an edge! - But, you said you know not how it works. - Well, I knew enough to make those soldiers, go wherever they went, and I know we can use it to change our form! We can make ourselves look like the soldiers, and walk right into the castle! - And then what? - We'll figure something out. You coming or not? - Of course I'm coming! - All right since we got to figure out something, let's just go in the morning, okay? - Now! (haunting suspenseful music) - Look I mean, even if we do change into soldiers, it's not gonna be that easy to just stroll in through that gate up there! - Why do you not use the power of your ring, you could send them all away! - I don't want to do that if I don't have to. I don't know where they go. I don't want anybody to get hurt. (crickets chirping) (tense music) - [Soldier] All right, you take the first watch. - [Soldier] Right. - [Soldier] Be very careful. - Them. (rumbling) - Johnny what are you doing? (magical whooshing) (tense music) - Hello. - Hello. - [Blackmoor] Hello. (suspenseful music) - [Soldier] They sound a bit peculiar? - And, a bit strange, yeah. - Yeah. - Johnny, change us back will you? - Okay. (magical jingling) - Come, come this way. (suspenseful music) Twas strange, having the form of a man. - (chuckles) I don't mind so much having the form of a man from the Middle Ages I just don't like smelling like him! Where are we now, huh? Ah, don't tell me. King Arthur's round table? (regal music) Oh boy I don't believe it! - Tis true. Here's where Malfeasor worked his devil's magic, and over-threw King Arthur and his true knights. It was just a year ago, and it seems forever. - Johnny! Johnny look at this! If I'm not mistaken, this is the sword from the stone! - Wow! - The Excalibur (chuckles)! Oh boy, just thrown away, I can't believe it, like trash! - Why don't you keep it Mr. Blackmoor? - Me, the Excalibur? Oh no no no, no I'm not, I'm not worth of it! - Yes you are! I believe in you! All you have to do is just, just believe in yourself! (magical jingling) - Where to now? Come on guys. (tense music) (rumbling) (dramatic music) - Johnny! - Blackmoor! Sprout! - Johnny! (knocking) - Hey, hey! - Merlin. (magical whooshing) (dramatic music) - Do not bother boy, he cannot help you, he cannot even help himself. (knocking) (gasping) (clockwork ticking) (mechanical laughing) - Get lost! (magical zapping) - Purt! - Disappear! (magical zapping) - Memalax! I admire Merlin. He always took the long view, always a scheme with you old man. This I feel is his last scheme. You see boy, ring cancels out ring. There is no magic that one can cast that the other cannot avert. And when both rings cancel each other out, what is left boy but you and I, the way nature made us, and history carved us. And who do you suppose will triumph boy? Do you think you will defeat me? - You will never defeat Arthur! You will never be king! - King? I spit on all kings! I spit on all kingdoms and castles and great works! - Turn to stone! (magical whooshing) (crackling) - Memalax! I speak no dreams of glory and hopes and heroes! - Change into a rat! (magical ringing) - Memalax! (eerie squeaking) Not rat my boy, say rather, maggot! King Maggot, for I have sworn to turn this land into one vast corpse, and when the whole of the earth is rot and death, then King Maggot will rule all! (clockwork ticking) - Back! Get back! Back! - Ring, disappear! (laughing) (mechanical clicking) (hissing) - [Mechanicals] Die! Die! (weapons clanking) (grunting) (magical whooshing) - No need for me to avert that silly boy! (magical hissing) There's no place left to run boy (laughs)! (weapons clanking) (grunting) (Malfeasor laughing) You forget boy, that if my ring is shattered this day, how then can it exist to return from future time? - But if it must survive, you must be defeated, because it was Merlin who sent the ring down through time to me, not you! - We will see who will survive! (weapons clanking) - How can you kill what never lived? They have no hearts! (weapons clanking) (squealing) (grunting) - You are out of your depth boy! Do you really want to die here? - Do you? - All of your friends are dead by now boy, but you are (mumbles). (eerie hissing) - I've had enough of this, let me at 'em! Excalibur! (crunching) (eerie squealing) (Blackmoor laughing) Mess with a kid from Brooklyn (laughs)! (grunting) (weapons clanking) - I can give you your life boy, for a price! - What price? - For the ring of course, bid it flying to me! How much more powerful with two rings! How vast my reach! - Why would I trust you? - I swear by the ring itself, if I lie to you, may its power destroy me! You see boy, I am not destroyed. I cannot steal the ring boy, it has to be given to me freely. I tricked Merlin into giving it to me. There are no tricks for you boy, just hand me the ring, and I will see no harm will come to you, I will send you back to your time! What more can I say? - I will never give you this ring! - Very well then, ring cancels out ring! Flesh cancels flesh! (dramatic music) (grunting) (weapons clanking) (grunting) - I can't break... (grunting) (weapons clanking) - No more words boy, save one! Die! (grunting) (eerie squealing) (cage rattling) Die! (Blackmoor grunting) (eerie shrieking) Die, die! (sizzling) (mystical humming) Ah! - Merlin, break free! (mystical sizzling) (grunting) - Banish! (mystical sputtering) - Boy, use the king's sword! - Excalibur, find his heart! (mystical humming) (screaming) (mystical sizzling) (jingling) (somber music) - All things that live and breath, unto the fires of Hell I consign thee! (groaning) - You've done well my child, all of you. (birds chirping) - [Blackmoor] I'm so nervous, do I look all right? - [Johnny] Mr. Blackmoor, it's the Middle Ages. - [Blackmoor] Oh, right, right, right, I, I forgot. (officious music) - Merlin has told us of thee, my son. - We owe you our lives, and the lives of all of our subjects. - But what of you sir, who wielded my Excalibur so boldly? - Me Your Highness? I'm, I'm no one, I'm, just a trickster, a drunk, see? - Would that more of my knights might drink from the same vessel. - Take it Your Highness! I don't need it anymore. - Hmm, I thank thee. Thou hast done well, thou hast earned the gratitude of Arthur and of all Camelot. Now mayest kneel and bow thy heads, (mumbles). For thy courage, and the salvation of my kingdom, I make thee knight, Sir John, Lord of Mist. And for thy courage too, trickster, Sir Sydney, of Blackmoor. Rise then knights. Love honor, obey the knighthood. - My noble Lord, I fear I must bear these two away. (sighing) - Then, fare thee well, in thy lands beyond tomorrow. And one moment, I would ask thee a question, of the days yet to be. - I'll answer if I can. - In thy future time, am I remembered? - Yes, Your Highness, yes you are. - With, fondness (chuckles)? - Yeah. - Tis a good thing, to be remembered with fondness. Godspeed. - Come! (regal music) (flames crackling) Now, you know what to do to restore your noble sister? - Yes, I understand. - Good, and now, we must finish the business! - Finish, but... I-I thought that... - Oh, just because Malfeasor is dead? And the royal prince is restored, and the last chapter is written, oh no no no. The first chapter needs to be completed. Look. You see this ring? This ring was cast by fires from the edge of the world. 10 times 100 years I have worn this ring! No more, it's passed me by. Now, I bequeath it to you my child, the ring, along with the sacred scrolls that I shall give to you. Pass them on, daughter to daughter. And the ways, and the words I will teach you. Do not be afraid. - I will not be afraid. For if it hasn't happened yet, it just may. - Oh don't tell me that, your granny said that to you, right? - No, I thought it up myself. - By the blood child, your blood, the burden will be carried through to Sir John's time. - I will not fail. - She won't. I mean, she didn't, but... If she keeps that ring, what about this one? - Well, all shall be revealed. The ring is in good hands. Sir John of Mist, raise your right hand. Press it to the parchment. - Godspeed heroes. And thank you. - Wait a minute kid, you ain't going anywhere without me. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. (dramatic music) (mystical humming) (thunder booming) (magical sizzling) (magical whooshing) - The circle, is closed! (mystical booming) - [Blackmoor] Ah! Aw, oh no, we're up a tree again! Oh boy that Merlin he's sure got a sense of humor, huh? - Come on we gotta hurry! (anxious music) (Blackmoor laughing) - Hey this is really cool, did you build this? - [Johnny] Yeah! - Hey you're back! - This isn't working, it's not working! - Boy I hope you've had a good time, 'cause while you've been messing around in some medieval theme park I've been going through a living hell! - Well Glenn I can't change you back yet! - Your parents are coming home any time now. What did you say? - Look Glenn, I can't change you back yet! The real Andrea has to be here first! - Then what are you waiting for? - Look, go watch out for Rose, okay? - Can do, no problem. (anxious music) - Hold on, hold on, move over, move over. When you deal with the kind of equipment I got, you get used to doing this kind of stuff 30 seconds before air time. (tense music) (vacuum cleaner whirring) (thumping) - Come on! (anxious music) - Ah! (Blackmoor laughing) (vacuum cleaner whirring) - Okay kid, you're on (chuckles)! Come on kid, show me what you got! - As you can see, no secret panels, no trap doors, no place to hide. - Spin it! - Now, I just spin, the box in the opposite direction. I will say the magic words! - Faster! - Toomara, toomaru, toomara! (echoing) Toomaru, toomara, toomaru! Andrea, reappear! (anxious music) - Johnny, Johnny, Rose alert! - Toomara, toomaru, toomara! Toomaru! (magical ringing) (dramatic music) - Wow, you made all the kids disappear. Hey, she looks just like me! - Glenn, get inside! (comically tense music) - Johnny Mysto! You're in a big trouble young man! (suspenseful music) Johnny, what do you have to say for yourself? - [Glenn] Uh, we went camping! - What? - We went camping, it's all your fault! - We, we were on a camping trip, and, it's all my fault! - Who are you? - Uh... - You're the man from the cable, I recognize you! - Would you like an autograph? - No! Johnny, where is Glenn? - Oh, Glenn, uh, I, I don't know, where is Glenn? - I asked you first. - Hey Andrea, I better give you your lucky coin, huh? - Yeah where's my coin? - Andrea, Andrea thank goodness! Your voice is back in normal. - It is? - It sure would be nice to have that coin, I bet if I open this up I'll get it right here! Here. (dramatic music) Yes, yes! - Ha, I'm back to normal! - Glenn, there you are! - Yes, yeah! Oh yes I'm back! It's so good to see you (chuckles)! Yes, yes! (slapping) Whoo! - There there Glenn, it's all right! - Hello, we're back! - Look Rose, I did something really stupid, I'm really sorry. If you tell mom and dad, I'll understand. - Well then, if there's no harm done, let it be our little secret, huh? (sighing) To tell the truth Johnny, I didn't think you had it in you. - To tell you the truth, neither did I. (crickets chirping) - [Announcer] Appearing together for the first time on any stage, we present, the new dream team of magic and illusion, the Amazing Blackmoor and Johnny Mysto, Boy Wizard! - That's my boy! - Prepare to be amazed! - Our boy! - Their boy! - Go Johnny!
