Lakhan Singh doesn't ask for what he wants. - He snatches it. - Leave me! Uncle, save me! Uncle, save me! Leave me! Please help her! I'd so many wishes to get her married grandly. All my desires are ruined. Mansukh's son is inauspicious. Dacoits plundered 10 days after his birth. Brother, go home. We lost what we'd to. Go now. Go. You've to come to police station to lodge complain. Don't forget. Chief, this is the booty. Share it. You can share these jewelries. I'll keep that booty. She's booty too and booty has always been shared here. Don't talk nonsense. Jaggu, she's a woman. She can belong to only one man. She'll belong to everyone. We can share her too. Jaggu. Chief, this isn't right. The gang will get divided because of a woman. There will be enmity. Who can dare to be Lakhan's enemy? She's mine. I've brought her. Not you, but we brought her, Lakhan. Lakhan! Lakhan! Chief! Leave me! Don't dare to even look at her! She's mine. Leave me, dacoit. I didn't say I'm a saint. I'll make you mine! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me, scum! Leave me! Leave me! Leave me, butcher! Dear! You wound me and call me a butcher. Here. Bite this too. Bite it! I detest you. I hate you. I know how to change hate into love. I'll die to save my honor. No. I don't want to dishonor you. - I want to make you mine. - Don't touch me. Stop. I say stop. I'll kill you. I'm already dead in your love. Keep the gun down. Your delicate wrist will get sprained. Lakhan, I'll shoot. You need strong heart to shoot. Woman's heart is delicate and strong too. She can give life and take life too. Lakhan, stop! It had just one bullet. Wait. Shoot me! Chief. Chief, what happened? She fired. Wait. She tried to kill you, chief. Kundan, the girl is very brave. I'm enticed by her bravery. I've seen many girls in life. But none as brave as you. Don't fear. I've no wrong intentions about you. I respect you. If you've humanity, let me go. Ok. Go. Let her go! Wait. Kundan, bandage me quickly. I'll drop her home. Chameli, go to sleep. I can't sleep out of fear. What to fear now? Sleep restfully. Lakhan Singh left the money.. And took Champa who was a burden on us. Villagers said that Mansukh's son is inauspicious. May they rot! They say there was plundering 10 days after his birth. Did he go to call the dacoits? His good fortune went there. Look, he freed us from getting Champa married. Now he has made us inherit Champa's property. Thank God Lakhan Singh abducted Champa. You're not such a big dacoit like them. I considered them my parents. But they consider me a burden. Lakhan, you wanted me make me yours. They don't need me. You need me. Take me away. Wait, Champa. Let me first settle scores. No! I don't want anything. I don't even want to see these sinners. - Dear.. - Yes? It seems someone is talking outside. It must be some neighbours. What if they're dacoits? Will dacoits come to plunder again or return the booty? They took what they wanted. Champa. Creator of world! 2Today with you as the witness, I marry Champa. God, give me strength to support her for life. And keep my Champa happy. Champa, will you say something? Champa. What are you thinking? Champa, I'm thinking that our first night is so unique. Yes! Roof of sky and stars. Light of moon. And cover of moonlight. Tonight is the dawn of my life. I've blemished many such nights with my sins. Champa, I'm indebted to you. You've brought me to light from darkness. You gave new direction to my life. You turned me into human from beast. And you.. Don't say that? You.. I don't think now there is need to address me so formally. Champa. It's dawn. Chief hasn't returned yet. It seems chief is back. Just the horse. It seems Lakhan is caught. Or got killed. Now it's dangerous to stay in this place. We should leave this den immediately. Look, this is the house. I'll take 10 rupees as rent. If you like it say yes or return. No. We like it. We really like it. Listen carefully. If you stay properly I'll be like your Ganga aunt or else.. I got it. - What's your name? - What is Ram's younger brother's name? - Laxman? - It's a nice name. - And you? - Champa Kali. Shameless! You shouldn't take your wife's name. Look, I'm going. Call me if you want something. - Ok, aunt! - What a lovely couple! Listen. You'll be responsible for any damages. - Damages! - Yes. What are you looking at! You really make a nice couple. What was aunt Ganga talking about? Sir, the dogs stopped near the river bank. This amulet has Lakhan Singh's name. - So this rifle must be his too. - I agree. It's possible that they must've fought.. Amongst themselves for Champa. And they killed Lakhan Singh and throw him in the river. Or it's possible that to deceive the police.. Lakhan played all this tricks and moved with this gang. We should keep looking for them. Who is it? Inspector! Oh God! What will happen now? Open the door. I'm alone in the house. - Where is your husband? - He's out. What's his name? - Laxman Singh. - Don't lie. Open the door. I won't open the door until he doesn't return. Look, open the door or the door will be broken. Constable, break the door. No, I'll open the door. You? Hey, Champa! You're crying like kids. Champa. I've been whistling all day. Now you whistle. Leave me! I don't like such pranks. I was scared to death. Forgive me. When I got tired wandering I thought of this joke. Now stop kidding. Did you find work? I Champa neither work nor anyone will hire me. So I'm thinking of buying a cart to earn a living. I'll be the owner and the worker. That's fine. You'll run everything. When will you start? Champa, I can start today. But.. We need some money for it. Don't worry. I'll arrange the money. You don't worry. What's this? You think I'll sell your jewelries to buy cart. No, Champa. I won't sell your jewelries. Do you remember you said that day.. Champa, I don't want your jewelries, but you. Today I say, I don't want your jewelries, but you. Champa, these jewelries look good on you. I won't take them. Your love has adorned my body and soul. When our business develops I'll make as jewelries much as I want. - Take them. -No, Champa. - I bind you with my oath. Take them. Take them. Champa. "As long as there is life in the body.." "As long as there is life in the body.." "I promise you, companion.." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "As long as there is life in the body.." "I promise you, companion.." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "Whenever you feel hot, I'll cover with you my veil." "When you get tired in the evening, I'll take you in my lap." "I will be in your house as moonlight." "I will be in your house as moonlight." "As long as there is life in the body.." "I promise you, companion.." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "Now my entire life is for you." "May you always be happy!" "Even if my life gets sacrificed." "I will give up life, but not support." "I will give up life, but not support." "As long as there is life in the body.." "I promise you, companion.." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." "I will be yours. You'll be mine." Please wait. Champa, what are you doing? Oh! You wanted tamarind. Take this. Take some more. Champa, you're eating raw tamarind. If you eat some much tamarind, you teeth will get sour. You can't chew bread. You eat bread, I'll eat tamarind. You'll eat tamarind? My dear Champa! Is it so? Really? You look worried. No, uncle. - Uncle, does it take so long? - Yes. - Is it done? - Have patience. Nothing has happened. Nothing. Champa is taking long. It's done! Where are you going? - Can't I go in? - No. Aunt, is it a boy or a girl? - It's a boy! -Hail lord Hanuman! - Congrats! Aunt, are you sure it's a boy? Did you check properly? Yes, I'm sure it's a boy. Go quickly and bring sweets. Forget sweets, aunt. I'll bring the confectioner. Confectioner is there, not here. I don't know what happened. I'm going mad. - Yes.. - Hail Lord Hanuman! Champa, we're so fortunate. Elders used to say that a woman who gives birth to a son.. Increases in stature. God knows how high your stature got! But ever since Jaswant is born, I've become very strong. I don't get tired no matter how hard I work. I too like it at home. When you used to go out, I used to wait looking at the door. Really? What do you look at now? Now all the time I keep staring at your son. When he smiles, it seems you're smiling. And when he cries, it seems I'm crying. No matter what, Champa, he looks like me. May God doesn't give him brains like you. Why? You're scared he might elope with some village damsel like me. I can't win in argument with you. - How are you, Laxman? - How are you, Bhola? How come you're in this market today? - We've to go to every market for goods. - Ok. That fool has come! Who owns this cart? I say who owns this cart. Boss, this belongs to me. Give me 25 cents. But sir, I'm here for the first time. First time? Give me 50 cents. Sorry, sir. You too give me. It seems you came for the first time too. Give me 50 cents. For what? Didn't anyone tell you.. That I collect tax from whose who sit under this tree? Do you own this land? No matter how owns the land, I collect the tax. Strange! Land and tree belongs to government. Shade is of the tree. Then why should I give you tax? Don't talk rubbish! My law is obeyed here. What kind of law is this! This is hooliganism. This isn't hooliganism, but don Birju's law. How dare you argue with me! Wrestler! It's my hard earned money. Return it to me. You want the money? Bhola, distribute these money amongst all. Get up! You want 50 cents. Do you know me! I'm.. I'm.. Bid farewell to wrestler! Hail Laxman! I say why did you fight. A thief can give you stealing, but not conning. You're a father of a son. If you feel like fighting you can hit me. Did you get hurt? I got some bruises. I applied dust and bandaged it. Bandaged it! - Champa. - Don't talk to me. Ok, I'll talk to Jaggu. - Don't talk to him. - Why not? Jaswant is my son. Your mother fights a lot with me. You made him cry. Now you make him quiet. Oh dear! Make him quiet! I'll do it. I'm not asking you for help. Keep quiet, son! It's a matter of my honor. Champa Kali! Look at your darling son. Where are you? Listen. Do you know what he did? He was abusing and throwing stones near the betel-leaf shop. Why did you hit me? I didn't hit him. When I stopped him, he abused me too. You're laughing. My son abuses me and you're laughing. Hail India! Champa, are you ready or not? I'm coming. You're taking too much time. Where is our Jaswant? I'm here. Oh! Are we going to fair like this? Oh! Wow! Great, Champa Kali. Make him wear some clothes too. He has harassed me. Come in. - Come in! - What are you doing? - Tell me child, who is he? - My father. - Who is this wrestler? - It's me. - And this beautiful moon? - She's not a moon, but my mother. Shut up! She's my moon. Here she's. Champa! Champa! What happened! It hurts a lot here. - Did you used to get such pain earlier too? - Yes. I don't know why I feel a piercing pain. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Lie down. Lie down. I'll take you to some doctor tomorrow morning. - What happened, mother? - Nothing, son. See. See. Take medicine. This medicine doesn't seem to make any difference. I've been taking it for many days. Try it for 2-4 days more. If you still don't feel better, I'll take you to a big doctor. Take it. This is your wife's X-ray and blood report. I've checked it. Your wife has cancer. Cancer? Yes. Take her to Bombay as soon as possible. Bombay! Sir, where will I go in such a big city? With this report I've written a letter.. To my friend doctor Malhotra. You can go to him. - How much will be the expense? - Around 4-5 thousand. 4-5 thousand. You've come. Champa, why did you get up? Lie down. What did the doctor say? Doctor says it's nothing serious. It's a minor ailment. You'll recover soon. You're hiding something from me. Look at me and say what he said. Champa, it's nothing like that. If it will be serious, I'll take you to Bombay. You'll take me to Bombay? And you say its minor ailment. But Champa, every disease can be cured. Why do you worry? I'll get you treatment. Where is he? Where is Jaswant? He must be playing outside. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. Laxman, what is it? I've no work today. Sir, I came because of my work. My wife is sick. Please save her. If she's sick go to some doctor. Why are you telling me? Doctor told me to take her to.. Bombay for treatment or she'll die. Then take her to Bombay. But expense to take her to Bombay will be 4-5 thousand, sir. You mean I should give you the money. - In return for what? - For my life. I'll be your slave for life. - I'll do whatever you say, sir. - Go away. Let me do my work. You can't get money this way. Get lost. Don't cry, son. Don't cry. Here. Eat this. - Water.. - I'll get it. Champa. I told you many times not to work. You can't even rest. Lie down now. Lie down. Please take my life. I can't break this pain now. Don't say that, Champa. If I could, I'd take your pain. But don't worry. I'll take you to Bombay. You'll surely recover. How can I recover? How will we get so much money! I can't survive. What are you saying today? Champa, I'll snatch you even from God. You're a man yet you're crying. No, Champa. I'm not crying. Lie down. Sir, my wife has cancer. And for her treatment I need 5000. 5000? She isn't worthy of 5000. I say you should let her die. You can remarry. Don't mock me, Sir. I'm not mocking you. I'm giving you an advice. There is a saying to change old shoes and dead wife. Sir, I'm very sad. Don't sadden me. Then collect donation. Ask for charity from the community.. Vendor and shop keepers. I'll also give you some alms. - Sir! - Hey! Don't grab my collar. You came to beg, but you're acting snobbishly. Get lost. Ok, I'll go. I'm going through a bad phase. I won't let him enter the market! You mean to say I should give the money. - In return for what? - For my life. You can't get money for life. Get lost. 5000? She isn't worthy of 5000. I say you should let her die. You can remarry. Good! My darling son! Eat biscuit. - Good! - Come on, horse. - Come on, horse. - Good! Come on, horse. Come on, horse. Come on, horse. Come on, horse. Madam, is sir home? Yes. What do you want? My sir has sent a letter for him. - Come, son. - No, I won't. Don't worry about the child. I'll take care of him. Give him the letter. Come on, horse. Sir, a man gave you this letter. Yes. Sir, before sunset reach Bhairavnath temple alone. Beware! If you try to act smart or inform the police, your son..

"Meet me again at some corner by coincidence." "You can call me mad with a smile." "Or you can consider me crazy." "But what charm you've!" "You consider your dear one to be a stranger." "Neither are you naive nor immature." "What more can I say to you, dear?" "My darling! You may leave, but come tomorrow." "Meet me again at some corner by coincidence." "My darling! You may leave, but come tomorrow." "Meet me again at some corner by coincidence." Come, son Ajay. Come. - Greetings, uncle. - God bless you. Sit. Father gave some papers for you. - Manoharlal has sent you. - Yes. I'm happy to know that. - Sit. - Thank you, uncle. - Tell me.. - Sir, there is trunk call from Bombay. - Trunk call? - Yes. Son, sit. I'll be back in 5 minutes. No, you may attend the phone. I'll come later. - Wait for 2 minutes. I'll be back. - No, I'm in a hurry. Ok, fine. But consider this your house and keep coming. - Ok, bye. - Bye. - You came here too? - You came here too? - Who are you? - Who are you? - Why are you following me? - Why are you following me? - Is this your father's house? - Is this your father's house? It's my father's house. What's the matter? - Nothing, uncle. She's following me since morning. - Really? - Mister. - Miss. - Dad, you too are laughing? - Is he your dad? Of course. Is he your dad? Uncle, what's the time? I was about to get a call from Bombay. Bye. Son, where are you going? You can answer the phone later. Child, he's the one I used to mention to you. He's Ajay, son of my friend Manoharlal. Greetings. Greetings, Jailor. Come, Lakhan. How are you? I'm fine. What's the order for me? Because of your good behaviour.. I made recommendation to the government. You'll be released on Gandhi Jayanti. Jailor, where will I go after getting released? Why? Don't you've any kin? Most of them passed away. And those who are alive might not recognize me. Ok. Fine. - You called me, father. - Yes, son. - I wanted to talk to you. - Yes? I've selected a girl for you to get you married. Marriage? Yes, the girl is very nice. Very beautiful. She's also from a big family. The girl's father is requesting me a lot. Girls' family do request a lot, father. But some day boy's family has to decide too. Son. Now you've grown up. This is the age to get married. But I.. I don't want to get married now. Son, do you wish to stay a bachelor? Yes, father. That's what I'm thinking right now. Ok. I'll refuse Dhanpatrai. Dhanpatrai? The one with the paper mill? You selected her daughter. Now it makes no difference. - It does. - How? You want to stay a bachelor for your life. But father.. how long can one stay a bachelor? As long as you can. As long as I can? How is it possible? In scriptures it's mentioned that a human.. Should marry after the age of 25. Really? And then you too want the same. - Is it so? - Yes. What are you doing? Why did you stop? I greet this palace whenever I pass by. Why? Did anyone get martyred here? Yes. Long ago two cars and two hearts collided here. And I fell in love with my dream girl. Now you're laughing. But then you were getting angry and.. I was trying to appease you. Don't you remember? Go. Come tomorrow. Go. Come tomorrow. Come on. Sit. Birju, bring the luggage. Can't you hear? Are you deaf? Greetings, sir. Who are you? What are you doing here? Maybe you didn't recognize me. I'm Lakhan Singh. Lakhan? When did you come? Today. Even after life imprisonment I didn't die. Maybe I was destined to see you again. I'm happy to see you. Come. Come in. Come on. Hariya, park the car inside. Come. Come. Come and sit. Sit. Not on the floor, sit here. Ajay will be happy to see you. Son Ajay. Coming, father. Did you recognize him? He has grown so big. Come, son. Come. What's the matter, father? Who is he? You spent your childhood in his lap. He's Lakhan Singh. Lakhan! Dacoit Lakhan Singh! He was a dacoit in the past. Now after penance he has come to us as a noble man. Now Lakhan Singh will stay with us. Father.. It's dangerous if such a dacoit stays with a decent family. You're right, son Ajay. I shouldn't stay here. Don't worry about me, sir. I've lived my life. I'll pass the remaining days somewhere. Why somewhere else? Why not here? Ajay, if you're here today it's only because of Lakhan. If you hadn't returned you.. You wouldn't have been the apple of my eye.. But the support of his old age. Now Lakhan will stay with us. It's my decision. Got it? Ok. As you wish. Lakhan, Ajay is immature. Don't mind him. No, sir. Why should I mind it? While going to the jail I'd told.. Ajay to hate the word 'Dacoit'. But you're not a dacoit anymore. Ajay's heart will accept you too some day. Come. He doesn't value time. He says he can't live without me for a moment. And I'm waiting for half an hour alone. I'm fool to come before time. If I'd been 5 minutes, he would've got angry and said.. Look, Rekha. One who can't value time, can't value me too. I'm very busy. If you can't remember keep an alarm clock in your purse. Got it? Let him come. I'll ring his alarm. You? What happened? I can neither lie down nor stand up. I don't feel like getting up. Are you fine? No? You look fine. You won't understand, Rekha. This is an internal disease. Disease? What kind of a disease? - People dream at night. - Yes. - I dream in the day. - Really. I dream of only one thing. This dream keeps recurring. - What dream? Tell me. - I can't say. Why? Tell me. Don't force me, Rekha. I can't say. Tell me. I can't say. Ok, I too won't talk to you. - "I had a dream. - What was your dream? Tell me." - "My heart beats so fast. - How fast? Tell me." "I dreamt of a young man in your path." - Really? - Yes. "And you were in his arm like clouds." "That young man played with your tresses." "And your hands were on his cheeks." "That young man played with your tresses." "And your hands were on his cheeks." "Your locks and drape were spread around." "I saw something else too, but I can't remember." Listen. - "I too had a dream. - What was your dream? Tell me." - "My heart beats so fast. - How fast? Tell me." "I dreamt of a young man in my path." - Really? - Yes. "And I was in his arm." "He was just like you." "He held my hands with love." "He was just like you." "He held my hands with love." "My locks and drape were spread around." "I didn't see something else so I can't remember." "I too had a dream." "My heart beats so fast." "Now only he resides in my heart." "Ok, then let's part ways now." "In that case return my heart." "Take my blessings too, dear." "Our hearts aren't separate but united." "Meet me the way we met in dreams." "We had a dream." "We had a dream." "We had a dream." Yes, yesterday a thief entered our bungalow. Did he steal anything? No. The watchman nabbed him and dad handed him to the police. But our father kept him at home. - The thief? - No, a dacoit. Dacoit Lakhan Singh. - One who had abducted you in your childhood? - Yes. I want to see him. I never saw a dacoit. Why do you want to see a dacoit? If you see him you'll hate dacoit too. - Never mind. - Then come. He's the enemy of humanity whom you wanted to see. The hands which hold holy books are stained.. - With blood of innocent people. - What are you saying, Ajay? Mr. Ajay is right, child. The man who gets a blemish on his character once.. Can't get rid of him again. I'd different views about dacoits. But he's a nice man. Every man looks nice. That's why evil hides in human form. Let's go. Why? You want to hear stories of dacoit? Come soon. Child, please go or Mr. Ajay will be angry. Why will he be angry? I'll be angry with him for misunderstanding such a nice man. No, Mr. Ajay is very nice. Since when do you know him? Since a few days. You like Ajay. We're going to getting engaged. What a nice couple! God bless you. May you live long! Father, you've nobody in this world. I've. All are mine. You, Mr. Ajay and sir are all mine. Don't worry, uncle. I'll come in this house soon. Then I'll serve you. God bless you. Rekha. Uncle, bye. I'll come later. God bless you, son! May you live a happy married life! Manoharlal, congratulations on new bonds. Have sweets. Such grandeur in engagement. What will they do during the wedding? Lakhan Singh. Lakhan Singh. What are you doing here? Go and look after the guests there. Go. Come. Come. - Lakhan, have some sweets. - Yes. Sir, you too have it. Lakhan, you're happy as if your son is getting engaged. Yes, sir. Ajay is my.. I mean Mr. Ajay is like my son. I gave him love for 8 years. I kept him close to my heart. Today I'm very happy. Today I'm very happy. Hello! - Why are you shouting? - Hello. Who is it? Rekha? Just hold on. Why did she call in the middle.. Hello. Are you in a bad mood? Mood? Yes, it's bad. And if you want to cheer me up.. Meet me in the evening at the same place. Then keep your mood bad. It's not so bad. But yet if you meet in the evening it can get better. Whether good or bad, we'll now meet only after the wedding. Why? Because after wedding I'll come to your house for ever. I know. If not here where else will you go? What do you mean? I mean our fate is one now. I too can't live without you. But Rekha, we can't talk romantically after marriage. After marriage.. Hey! Very nice! Kalavati. Kalavati. - Kalavati. Kalavati. - What? -Where is my gun? I don't know. Did I go to hunt or what? Where is Lallan? Son Lallan, you're going out at night with gun. - What's the matter? - Uncle, you're a dacoit. Teach me how to shoot. Why do you want to learn to shoot, son? - I'll shoot my father. - Oh Lord! It's a sin to say and hear such thing. My father is the biggest sinner. What are you saying? You should be ashamed. Father is like God for a child. Go and keep the gun back to its place. This isn't a child's toy. Uncle, you too consider me a child. I'm eligible for marriage. Ok, the day you get married I'll lead your.. Marriage procession firing this gun. No. I can't get married as long as my father is alive. First I'll kill him. - I.. - Lallan! Lallan! Oh. Father. Where is my gun? Lallan. Take this gun. Lallan. Take this gun. He's a strange boy. Where are you going with this gun? Mr. Ajay, I didn't bring this gun - His son Lallan brought it. - What rubbish! You accuse my son. I said it before too that it's not.. Right to keep a dacoit home. You cheat your master. Tell me, why did you steal the gun? Mr. Ajay, I didn't' steal the gun. You're lying! Ajay. Don't act like beast! Aren't you ashamed to raise hand on your elders? God knows what this dacoit wanted.. To do after stealing the gun. Keep quiet. Lallan had brought the gun, not this poor fellow. Ask him. - Lallan, did you steal the gun? - Yes, father. You fool! I'll teach you a lesson. I feel as if you've slapped me. It is foolishness and naivety to do anything without thinking. I'm sorry on Ajay's act. Please forgive Ajay. Please forgive him, brother. Which father won't forgive his father? But no father can face his son after getting slapped. I won't live here. I can't live here. I'll go away. "Even the storm shed tears in penance." "Yet the blemish of past crimes can't be wiped." "Even the storm shed tears in penance." "Yet the blemish of past crimes can't be wiped." "Fate makes man helpless and destitute." "This is the game of destiny." "This is the game of two sides of one coin." "Human can be both good and evil." "Human can be both good and evil." - Jaggu you? - Greetings, chief. Where are you sneaking at night? I'm going away, Jaggu. Very far away. You're strange, chief. You're leaving this luxury, comfort and your big mansion. Silly, that mansion isn't mine but of sir Manoharlal. But your son is the only heir of Manoharlal's entire property. He's not my son. He's sir Manoharlal's son. His name is Ajay. Not Ajay, but Jaswant. No. Not Jaswant. Don't worry, chief. Only both of us know this secret. But he should live in this house as Ajay only. Jaggu, I expected this from you. Chief, not so soon. I too expect something from you. Jaggu, what do you want from me? You made Jaswant into Ajay and made him a billionaire. Now make your old servant at least a millionaire. Jaggu, tell me clearly. What do you want to say? Chief, you've gone senile in old age. You don't understand this. Give me just one Lakh rupees. Jaggu, don't try to take advantage of my helplessness. Chief, you can't make me quiet with anger but with love. With money. When should I come to get the money? But I don't have so much money. How will I get it? I know you don't have money. But your son has it. Sir Manoharlal has it. Anyway if you don't pay me, I'll ask sir Manoharlal. No! No, Jaggu. Don't go to sir. Don't ask him. Tell me, when should I come to take my share? It is a very cheap deal. Just one Lakh to let Jaswant live as Ajay. - But.. - Chief, Lakhan can arrange one Lakh in one hour. But I give you 24 hours. I'll come here tomorrow night at this time. Keep the money ready. Go. Go home and rest. Listen. Don't try to deceive Jaggu. Go. Go. Come, Lakhan. - What do you want, sir? - Nothing. Just select these jewelries. I've made for Ajay's bride. How are they? I don't know anything about jewelries. I just value your happiness. I know that you too are as happy as I'm. Because you're also like Ajay's father. Sir, for me you're like God. For a lowly man like me, you've so much respect. Oh! Don't consider yourself lowly. I trust you a lot. I respect you a lot. I want you to spend this money during the wedding. You too have equal right on Ajay. Sir. You're crying. These are tears of happiness, sir. Ok, you may go and rest. Dacoit Lakhan Singh! It's dangerous for a decent family to keep such a dacoit at home.. Father. Ajay, you're here only because of Lakhan. If he hadn't returned you.. You wouldn't have been the apple of my eye.. But the support of his life. Don't consider yourself so lowly, Lakhan. I trust you a lot. I respect you a lot. I want you to spend this money during the wedding. You too have equal right on Ajay. Tell me, when should I come to take my share? It is a very cheap deal. Just one Lakh to let Jaswant live as Ajay. Lakhan can arrange one Lakh in one hour. But I give you 24 hours. I'll come here tomorrow night at this time. Who is it? Who are you? Lakhan! You? Scum! Did I support you for this day? Ajay was right. You're a dacoit. A traitor. I'll hand you to the police right away. No, sir. No. - Lakhan! - No! - Lakhan! - No! Sir! Oh God! What a nightmare! I can't even think of it. Jaggu. You? Greetings, chief. I came as per my promise. This is the second night. Money? Jaggu, how can I get so much money? You think about it. You can steal or borrow from sir Manoharlal.. Or from your son Jaswant. Not Jaswant, his name is Ajay. I told you earlier too that I'm not his father.. Sir Manoharlal is. And I told you too that to keep Jaswant stay.. As Ajay you've to pay one Lakh rupees. Lakhan, if you don't pay, I'll expose you. I'll tell sir that Ajay isn't your son.. But Lakhan's son Jaswant. Jaggu. My brother. Don't ruin my sacrifice. Because of my mistake and nature's cruelty.. The son of this house had died. I was sorrowed by sir's grief so I sacrificed.. My love and gave him my son. And today.. he's very happy thinking that Jaswant is Ajay. He's very happy. For God's sake don't steal their happiness, Jaggu. Don't ruin my penance. Ok. Then give me some joy too. Look, Jaggu. Don't be stubborn. I beg of you. I implore you. This is my right, chief. Your right was to share the booty. Not more, just one Lakh. Jaggu, don't force me take up my past form. Or else you won't return alive. Before that I'll ruin you and your son's life. - Scum! I'll kill you. - Leave me! Lakhan! Scum! Scoundrel! Sir, you don't know that Lakhan had cheated you. I know everything. You want to blackmail me by proving.. My son to be a dacoit's son. Forget you, even if Lakhan says that Ajay isn't my son.. - I won't believe it. - But sir, listen to me. I don't want to. Get out of here. Or I'll hand you to the police. Ok. Lakhan, I'll surely avenge this insult. Get out of here. Go! Lakhan, I'm an aggrieved father. And you're my son's killer. No, sir. I'm not a killer. God knows that I didn't kill your son. To save my family, I abducted your son. But destiny held something else. That innocent boy fell from the hill and made me a murderer. I'm still paying for one moment of sin. I couldn't even save my Champa. 8 years after I ruined your house and got my house ruined.. When I saw you in that condition, I couldn't bear it. I made my Jaswant your Ajay and handed him to you. Sir, I still remember that night.. When my Jaswant was screaming.. Father, don't leave me. I'm not sir' son. I'm your son. But sir.. For your peace and to offer penance I suppressed my feelings. And I considered your son to be mine for 17 years. I've accepted him as my Ajay. He's part of my body and soul. Lakhan.. It'll be better for the three of us if you leave immediately. Because whenever I'll see you.. I'll remember that Ajay isn't mine. Even after many efforts my decency.. And humanity can't suppress.. The arousing feeling of hatred for you. Lakhan, go away. Yes, sir. I'll go away. I'll go right away. Right away. I'll leave. Yes, Lakhan. I'll hide the grief of my son's death and hatred for you.. In my shattered heart for ever like a tomb. Don't be scared! If anyone moves, I'll shoot. Get aside! Nobody will move! Beware! Don't move! Get back. Quiet! Sit quietly! Dacoit! Dacoit! Father! Rekha! Inspector, nab these goons quickly. Move! Why did you stop playing the music? Keep playing it. Remove your jewelries. Not there, keep it here. Beware! If anyone moves, I'll start firing. Sir Manoharlal, that day was yours. This is my day. Move back! Jaggu! Lakhan is still alive! Scum! You forgot your status! - I'll kill you. - Lakhan, no. - Leave him, Lakhan! - No, sir. - He got his punishment. - Sir, this scum.. I won't spare him. He.. Forgive me, sir. He turned me into a beast. Forgive me, sir. - Dhanpatrai, he's the Lakhan, who.. - No! No! Lakhan! Lakhan! Uncle. Don't cry, child. Bid your uncle farewell with a smile. - Lakhan. - Lakhan. Sir. My life became successful. While dying I came of use to you. Uncle.. Uncle, forgive me. You saved my father's life. You're not human, but an angel. Son Ajay. Lakhan is greater than an angel. To repent for his one mistake.. He made not one but two sacrifices. No, no, sir. No, Lakhan. Let me speak. You kept this secret hidden in your heart for life. Now you want to die with this secret. I don't have so much courage. I can't be under more burden of your favor. No. No, sir. Ajay, I'm not your father. No, sir. Unfortunate Lakhan is your father. Lakhan! Father! Lakhan! Lakhan! "Except your good deeds you won't.." "Take anything from this world." "Except your good deeds you won't.." "Take anything from this world." "Everything else burns with the pyre." "Except your good deeds you won't.." "Take anything from this world."
