It seems you've just learned. Laurita is no longer here. Laurita is dead Ramirez. Where you've been? Where were you when she got sick? You've been hiding, haven't you? You vanished Ramirez. You left me alone with my three kids. Shut up! Shut up! With those thieves and scoundrels always drinking. You drunk, drunk, drunk! Look at you. Do something. Lying in bed all day like an old rag. You have your two sons. She was the only thing I had. Are you stupid or something? Mommy says stupid is as stupid does. - I'm Jenny. - I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump. Momma always told me that miracles happen every day. Some people don't think so but they do. You lose. You're such a cheater, Serafo. Look, Jose. Where do fish go when they die? They go back to God. Like Laurita? Like Laurita. Don't leave me alone. I want to go too. But you have to take care of Mom. Sofi, stay here. - What are you doing, Jose? - Everything ok, Pajarito? Yeah, everything ok. Take, these are for your brother. But I still don't know if I'm taking my brother. Ok, no problem. I brought them anyway, just in case... try them on to see if they fit. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. Did you tell anybody? No, nobody. - Ok, see you, thanks. - Bye. Take the West Highway. Straight ahead all the way. Here, take this for the trip. - Bye, fella. - Bye, thanks. Would you like if someone did this to you!? Why doesn't it come out? I don't know, it's sleeping. What are you doing around here? - We wanted some water. - Ah, water. - Would you like to eat a sandwich!? - Yes. The friend here will give you a sandwich. Like a mate? - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. What's the matter, Serafo? I'm tired, Jose. I told you that we had to walk all the way. I think I have blisters from so much walking. - Were are you going? - To Lujan. C'mon, I'll give you a lift. Don't yell over the phone. Why don't you yell at me when we see each other? Give me my ol'lady, put her through! Jose, Jose, wake up! What's wrong, Serafo? This guy scares me, he's yelling. And the music is too loud. Tell him we want to get off. You can fool my ol'lady, but not to me. The house is my ol'lady's, you stupid. Sir, we are getting off, I say. The house is my ol'lady's! Put her through! You're not selling the house. Stupid, let me talk to my ol'lady! Let's jump. One, two... Scream at me face to face. and three! LUHAN: CAPITAL OF FAITH Virgencita, here I am, as I promised. I'm tired, Virgencita, our home is too far away. I want you to help Mom so that she gets well. I know you're always everywhere and that you have Laurita in your heart. Today we are here because of Mom. We want her to get up from bed. I beg you for all the families in the island and for all the families in the world that need you. Thank you very much, Virgencita. We love you a lot.
