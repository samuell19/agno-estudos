ALL DOCUMENTS, CHILDREN'S DRAWINGS AND POEMS FEATURED IN THIS FILM ARE AUTHENTIC AND WERE CREATED BETWEEN 1941 AND 1945. BUTTERFLIES DON'T LIVE HERE TEREZĺN, 1941-1945 Story Collaboration Cinematography Editor / Producer Music Conductor Narrators Director and screenplay Production Everything was devised according to a plan. The weird script still sticks to these walls. Block QL, Querstraße, Lange Straße, numbers on houses, on doors, even people received numbers. There were also children here. They played and they scribbled, just like all children do. These children were brought here on a train, and they were looking forward to that same train taking them home again. But neither this or that one did. It wasn't able to, or perhaps allowed to. But with a box of crayons, with pots of watercolours, their former homes came back to them. From back home came girls with flowers and boys with kites. Paths opened for them, offering to take them home. Home is warm, there's a lamp, a chair and a table, a window with a curtain. But that bed into which you need to climb a ladder, who has misplaced it in here? That's not the bed at home. All roads and paths lead home. Home is where the red scooter is. But there were ramparts. The ramparts were guarding a town, surveying its streets and houses. And the children drew it all. Even themselves, with stars sown onto their hearts. Triple ramparts encircled the town, surveying its streets. The children could watch them through the barracks windows. That was permitted. In the distance beyond the ramparts they saw animals and birds and the bluish hills of the Czech mid-lands. That's where they imagined was their home. There were backyards here and the central barracks yard in which they played. What joy for children who had been expelled from schools and suffered the horrors of the transport. There was a horse here that they couldn't get enough of. In the ghetto, the children could only see people harnessed into carts. They saw hearses delivering bread, they saw funerals consisting only in the gathering of coffins. With their crayons they even managed to capture executions on paper. The worst of all is the cook. He left the children queue in line. He cooked rotten potatoes for them. He left grandpa to chew on a hard crust! He, the cook! I'd like to go alone some place where people are different, nicer. Somewhere unknown. Where no one gets killed. I'd like to have a little house surrounded by a firm fence, or atop a high rock. If the house were atop a high tree, like a nest, a house behind a moat, a house like a castle behind a drawbridge, or beyond a deep river... I'd like my house to float down a river - can you hear? That's the sound of the foghorn. We have to sail for unknown ports. Can you hear? It's time. The wind is singing the song of faraway lands. To watch the heavens as we float along, thinking of the violets. The last, the very last one, the one so deeply, bitterly, dazzlingly yellow, as if the sun rang with a tear against a white stone. It's so, it's so yellow, it soared lightly on high. It went, surely, to give a kiss to its final world. My folks have found me here. Dandelions call to me and the chestnut's white bough. I haven't seen a butterfly here. That one back then was the last one. There are no butterflies living here in the ghetto. WORK SETS YOU FREE It's getting better. They've permitted the opening of the fort playground. Mummy began to sew for folks. She cannot earn much. For an entire dress, she can get a loaf of bread. They're opening the shops now. You can get mustard, cumin, and celery salt there. Odd printed money is used there. 'Ghettogeld'. Who for? What for? In the land of wealth, everything can be bought at a price of 1 CZK. Even a piggy pierced through by a fork. PUPPET THEATRE But the children saw things even adults couldn't see. They saw jesters and princesses under the spell of horrid dragons. They drew and acted in fairytale plays, not knowing that Terezin was just the first stop. Everything was devised according to a plan. Not even the adults knew Terezin was just the first stop on the long road to death. ...we got used to lining up at 7 am... ...and at noon and again at 7 pm... ...so that they could pour us some warm water into it... ...we got used to lining up with a dish in our hand... ...salty or coffee-tinged water... ...or maybe some potato... ...to slaps in the face for no reason... ...to greeting every uniform... ...forbidden to walk on pavements... ...then to walk on pavements only... ...we got used to random slaps, beatings and executions... ...we got used to seeing people die in their own excrement... ...to seeing crates overflowing with corpses, to seeing the sick in the muck, to watching helpless doctors... We got used to a thousand unfortunate ones arriving every now and then, and to a thousand even more unfortunate ones leaving from here. Auschwitz, Ravensbruck, Buchenwald, Majdanek... All the names haven't been written down here yet. Of the 15,000 children who played and drew here for a while, only a hundred returned. Drawings and poems are all that's left of them. And your memory. Can you hear? It's time. The wind is singing the song of faraway lands. To watch the heavens as we float along, thinking of the violets. THE END
