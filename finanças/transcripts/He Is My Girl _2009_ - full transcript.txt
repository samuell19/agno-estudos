It's sunny, it's summer. I like you, you like me. It's as simple as that. - Am I the man of your life? - Yes. - But there's a woman too. - That's easy. No, believe me, it's not easy. Raphaël, you're gay. It's obvious. You think so? He's My Girl Rise and shine! Thanks! Hurry, I have to go. What time is it? C'mon, get dressed. Move it! Get dressed. We're leaving. Can I take a bath? Slam the door behind you. Thanks. I asked you to turn your phones off. Sorry. Yes, speaking. Before midday? I can't. Impossible, you must be dreaming. I just said it's not possible. I understand what you're saying but understand me too. I can't. I'm perfectly calm! What can I do in this heat wave? It's July 14th. I'm not equipped for her at home. There isn't a single carer free in Paris. I spent two days looking for one. The social services are closed! There's a two-month wait anyway. Look, it's simple. She can't walk, so she needs care. I can't put her up. Drat, I forgot my watch. I'm fond of it. It's all I have of my mother's. It's July 14th, nobody's around. Remember how you used to lisp as a little boy? You'd tell people, "My mummy's 'riss', "she has a gold watch." Help! We're stuck in the lift! Let us out! Help! Fetch help! Please! Keep yelling and you'll use up all our oxygen. There you go. All right, sir? Don't worry, madam, we'll get you out. I've finished, I'm going. Look, all wrinkly like a baby! My mother's here. Don't worry. I'm gone. I can't sing? Ok, the Arab will shut his mouth. Simon? Are you there? Where are you? I'm thirsty! Coming! Sign here. I'm not comfy. This couch is too soft. Take my shoes off, my feet are swelling. I forgot your place was so big. You water the plants? Don't worry. It'll be all right. I've made a lot of progress. You live with someone? I'd like to, but my mother just moved in! I can turn a blind eye. He teaches philosophy, he's 30, we met a year ago, his name's Raphaël. Enough! That's all I want to know. I need to pee. You really can't walk? No. - Can you lift your feet? - Why? Fasten your seat belts! Stay there. Don't go away. Yes, don't worry. Know what I'd like? Some vegetable soup. But I'm not allowed salt. Because of my heart. I'm only allowed one gram a day. Go to a pharmacy. They sell it in doses. Try to find a free-range chicken. I'd like a thigh with some mash. Good luck! There's one New York date so far. Boston and Philadelphia haven't replied yet. I didn't tell you earlier but the New York concert is sold out. If Boston is the same, I'm all set. I can release 50,000 copies of the CD. Then there's Chicago. They haven't replied yet. I'm not going to New York. You're not serious? We'll work something out for your mother. Julien will soon find you someone. We have no choice. We start recording again tomorrow. I think Raphaël should come to New York with us. Why don't you call him? You play your best with a guy in your bed. I'll pay for his flight. - That's kind. - No, it isn't. I don't want to be kind to you. You piss me off. You're a royal pain in the ass. You're a great musician, Simon. Your CDs sell around the world. Yes, Julien. Well? Can't your mother spend a morning alone? Shit, you're late! Who is it? David. He's looking after you. You could have said! Why? You were planning on going out? Where are you off to? To church! I'm recording an album, remember. Four musicians are paid to wait for me. Arlette is ripe for a breakdown and I can't concentrate. Why am I even telling you? You don't give a damn. You're totally paranoid! No one matters but you. I never met anyone more selfish and narcissistic. It's incredible. You know how proud I am of you. Precisely! Hello, David! Chicken and veg, no salt. Watch she doesn't add any. - Can I say hello? - Later. - Got her X-rays? - Yes. It must be hell for her. Can't you find her a hospital bed? Even in a corridor or out in the country? I could get her into Rothschild with a broken leg. You could? Have you abandoned me? Everything's here. I have to run. I love you, cousin. I could snog you. Enough! Get to work! I've always dreamt of it. I hate guys touching me. You want to piss me off? I'll put you on my album cover. Be careful. Her heart's really weak. Simon! Come here quick! That's Rosalie. I live in New York now but I've always felt Parisian. I love Paris! I've experienced a lot here. The way you do in Paris. I've experienced things that are romantic, heartbreaking... She remembers you! Coming back for "Fiddler on the Roof", which deals with Jewish traditions... Going to see her? I hate "Fiddler on the Roof". I was very naïve back then. I thought life was a musical. It's ok. I'm here. No one will pounce on you. Well, I hope not. The first time I saw you, I was so moved, I didn't dare look at you. I think I love you. Imagine us living together. You'd soon tire of me. I don't think so. - You'd get sick of seeing me nude. - Far from it. I'd want you even more! - You're sure of that? - Yes! He's here! Will you play for us, Simon? Albert and I have all your CDs. You're a good son. Simon, we know a very good doctor. - He's at 17, Rue de Lubeck. - No, 19. Tell him we sent you. He took care of Marceline. She sold lily of the valley with him on May 1st. I tend to forget names... Bella! Your son! Don't shout, Esther, I'm not deaf yet. Red gladioli. From time to time, buy her red gladioli. Where were you? This is the Auschwitz Club. Have some strudel. I made it! Where were you? With Raphaël. That's not professional. No, it's sexual. Know what a day's recording costs? What do I do? Cancel everything? If so, pay back the 30,000 euros I've invested. You're right. I can't work. Call it off! He never sees things through. I ruin his concentration. It's my fault, it's all my fault. I cancel New York too? You really want that? Just say so right now. Simon, when we were in the camp, your mother... She never gave up. What's going on? If you stay in the sun, you'll get dehydrated. It's bad for old people. Can you put me back where I was? Here... Drink this. Simon! In this heat, you need a litre and a half a day. I won't move until you finish this glass. Drink now. I won't give you another drop after 5 o'clock. I don't want to be up all night taking you to pee. Have a drop more now to take your pills. - Now then, a quarter Zextrill... - No half. Sorry, the prescription says a quarter. Mrs Guénard, may I call you Babette? We can't argue all the time. Let's try to get along. I'm not a little girl anymore, so sit down and listen. I say it's a half Zextrill. Mrs Eskenazy, don't try to teach me my job. Drink up now. You see, it wasn't that hard. Where are you going? To work. What now? What? It's not right. It's not what I'm after. So what are you after? Will you come? Yes, of course. He'll be at the theatre. He's really grown. A most up to here. He'll be taller than you. I'm allowed to see him now? That's what I came here for. Let's get going! His name's Yankele. No, I'll come down. Can you take this heat? How come you don't sweat? Finished your record? Almost. I need to shave and wax. Can I take a bath? That's not possible right now. Here, will this be enough? You've sunk this low? Thanks a lot. Really. I'll never forget what you just did for me, Mr Eskenazy. Just outside the city There's a quaint little place On the banks of a river way down south My friend just bought a house there and every summer He spends whole days down south He even neglects work to go south He has no other ambitions His only joy in life is being down south Lekhaim! You're a real shit, baby. Give me a break! If you're not happy, get lost! Wait for me... You're not into Arab women? Want to go back to Tel Aviv alone? Why did you keep the West Bank after the Six-Day War? You're busting my balls! Run, Asterix, run! You're ashamed of me? - Château Rouge? - No way! Come on. Madam? A soft-boiled egg, two and a half minutes. - And orange juice. - Very good. No, grapefruit juice instead. Or rather a grapefruit. Certainly. And cappuccino with pastries. Sir? The same. Very good, sir. - May I keep it? - Certainly, madam. I'll be right back. Simon! Where have you been till now? Can you come here, please? It's urgent. I'm sick of it. She's Hitler's maid from Berchtesgaden! She has to go! She snores too. Hello, Mr Eskenazy. Know what your mother called me when I woke her? The Gestapository! How about that? You'll get your make-up after you apologize. You're the meanest person I've ever met. You're perverse, sadistic, and stupid beyond words. It's simple: you're fired. Pack your bag and leave. But you can't fire me, your son hired me. My son does everything I tell him. Get rid of this woman. I don't think you understand, Mum. Now we've found someone, you're going home with her. Once you can walk, do what you want. I can't look after you. I'm far too busy. The ambulance service? Yes, hello. Can you take an elderly person across Paris? This morning if possible. Could you pack her things? Yes. I'll wait. Simon Eskenazy. Yes, the same address. You brought her from the hospital. You know, Simon, I won't forget. I'll never forget. These few days have been wonderful. I was so happy. But you're right. There comes a time to leave. Give them an hour. None of this matters, dear. I love you as you are. And more than you think. I love you for yourself and also for my little brothers who weren't lucky enough to live and died in the camps. Where are you going? To get the washing. I have two messages for you. Raphaël phoned last night. You answered? I had to, it was ringing off the hook. A very friendly boy. And your bank called too. You're overdrawn by 13,000 euros. That's a lot. You'll be a lot better at home. I told you, she's mad. Totally mad! - What did you do to her? - Nothing. I said, "I'll flip you over and screw you like a pole-vaulter." - You didn't? - I did. And I say screw you as well. The way you treat your mother! Get out. Where are you? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. What? Is it serious? Raphaël! I can't sleep. I just can't. I keep thinking of you. How do you sleep? Come on. - Excuse me. - Sorry, brother. Got a room free? What do you think? - It's picturesque. - Picturesque... Nearly done? It's my mother. This'll take half an hour. I can't leave her alone. She needs her lunch. - Are you mad at me? - No. I won't be long. Stay right here. You'll stay? I found carrots but no kohlrabi. I got a chicken breast for lunch. How did you get in? The janitor had the key. Did Arlette send you? No, the local council did, Mr Eskenazy. Since I got back, my hair has been in a terrible state. Know how long it takes to get a hairdresser in hospital? Two weeks! And you pay in advance. In case you croak! As we say... "May God protect you." I agree with you. Nothing too radical. But a little henna will redden your hair a little and ligth up your face. With some brighter lipstick, you'll be even more beautiful, believe me. Isn't it a bit dry? A little. I'll bring you some palm oil. What's your name? Habiba. I'm Habiba, Mr Eskenazy. From Constantine. She studies in Paris. Really? What subject? International law. - She works to help her 6 siblings. - Seven. I'm impressed. She sends money every month. She's heroic. Others do the same. And it could be worse. You already know that, Mrs Eskenazy. Call me Bella. Lekhaim! She's wonderful! She even speaks Yiddish! She can sleep upstairs in the library. You don't mind? It's more comfy than the couch. Is that a problem? If my mother agrees, that's fine by me. You're lucky to have such a caring son. Do you live alone, Mr Eskenazy? He's divorced. The schmuck has a son he's never seen. He doesn't know his name. Go ahead, tell her my life story. Say I'm gay too. I bet she's interested. Simon! It's true. That's why I can't see him. He's never really tried. I did what I could. I don't even have a photo of my own grandson! There. Wait until it dries now. I've made a chorba, without salt. You'll love it. It beats a chicken breast. His name's Yankele. What's going? How long can this last? Let me do my cooking. What'll happen when she learns you're a guy? It'll kill her! - She'll think it was my idea! - It's a good one. You want to finish the CD? It's summer, Paris is deserted and it's me or someone else. You needn't declare me. I'm sick of the Paradise. Set the table, baby? Is something wrong, Habiba? Your son's haggling. He says I'm too expensive. You're a real bitch! I get 18 euros an hour. If it's too much, I can go elsewhere. Certainly not! You're staying! Simon! Mum, work it out. That comes to 2,500 euros a week. Don't be a schnorrer. We've found someone good. I love her hands. She's gentle. She's perfect! Come on, Bella, you can't eat in bed. - But I can't walk! - I know. Lean on me. I broke my hip! Cracked it, Mum, just cracked it. Sorry, I forgot you. Frozen, defrosted, frozen... Food Hygiene Commission. It wasn't all desert and camels. The Palestinians lived on that land. Did the Jews thrown out of Algeria get compensation? No, but they all miss Algeria. Why doesn't your mum miss Poland? Let me. Certainly not, Mr Eskenazy! Cut it out! You're not Habiba, you're Naïm! You're really hot, you know. I love your breasts. I want you. You get me hard. Can I touch your cute butt? Mr Eskenazy, please! Try to behave. He married for love? I think so. If he can love someone. It's a really complicated story. He says he suffered... In any case, Constantine isn't by the sea. It's a beautiful city, built entirely on rocks with... with bridges over a valley. Bring your son, you'll get a royal welcome. What's that? Your mother. Who goes, you or me? I haven't shaved. No temperature, she eats well, she sleeps well. From 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. But she's still in pain. 130/70 is perfect. She's taking her pills? You can count on me there! How is she? Very well. You've found a real treasure. I wish it would rain! She's great! Where's she from? Algeria. She's a Muslim? I don't know. Ask. You fancy her? Doctor, I can't find salt-free bread. A meal without bread is so gloomy. Can I give her some anyway? Yes, but only a little. A cup of coffee? I'd love one. How's your wife? And yours? Seeing her tonight for her premiere? I have nothing to wear. Do you take sugar? Yes, certainly. Mazel Tov! Can you give me her number? She's busy here around the clock. Come on. You owe me that. What do I get? Habiba, what do you think? He has a son and he won't see him. He'll see him! Inch'Allah! Inch'Allah! You're not interested? Why bother? It might make you less of a jerk. All right. We fall into each other's arms, we embrace, we cry... It's too late. I never know if I can see my son. - What does that make me? - A shmuck! Habiba, you seem to know Jewish culture very well. You're not just a nurse, are you? You're more than that... I don't know. What do you mean? I don't usually do this usually. But it's... You drive me wild... I really want to... Sorry, dear, we had a drop to drink. Here... He lives in Yorkshire. How did it go? Did you see them? He has a little dog. If you drink, you have to eat. She's a Muslim. It'll piss you off. Don't insist. She doesn't want you. No, I won't give you her number. To be quiet honest, she found you a bit too direct. David. I'm not here! You know what? You reminded her of the Israeli army entering Gaza. I know, all the women are mad about you. But she isn't. Get used to it. You can't have them all. Sorry, David, it's hopeless. Remember how I suffered when I loved you? Exactly. I know what you're feeling. We stay outside? I'll call you back. Can we come in? I was so happy your mother called. Was it you or Bella who invited us? It was me. You're still a good liar! Rosalie! Bella! A little. Yankele... I'll murder you! I'd make my room here! He started three years ago. He listens to your records all the time. I have some important news. I'm coming back to Paris. And I'm going to marry Ivan here. I'd really like you to be at the synagogue. I need to stick the pieces of my life back together. You'll be able to see your son any time. An adolescent boy really needs his father. I mean, he's looking for a male role model. The father has to ease the break with the mother so the child doesn't become fixated on her. Doctor Freud. I'll be marrying another man. It's hard for him. Put yourself in his shoes. Your life is complicated. This will simplify it. A child brings balance. You're as mad as ever. When's the ceremony? - Shit, he plays well! - Yes. If he sleeps here, don't keep him up too late. He keeps Shabbat and eats kosher. It's that simple. Be indulgent, Mr Eskenazy, he's nervous. Sorry, I forgot the cakes. You're too kind. Goodbye! Goodbye, Rosalie. Let me give you a kiss. Let me walk you to your cab. - Can you lend me a T-shirt? - Sure. - Hello, miss. - Hello. Who is she? My mother's nurse. I expected you to call, but you were right not to. It helped me think. I spoke to Florence. I told her everything. We're splitting up. She'd realized anyway. Come on. So you look after Simon's mother? No, I study international law. And who are you? Raphaël. I didn't mean to upset you. No chance of that! It's hard finding a home nurse right now. I wanted to be an ethnologist but opted for a philosophy degree instead. Because of my birth... sorry, my discovery of the Greeks and then of Nietzsche. I did my thesis on the birth of tragedy. Apollo, Dionysos... Maybe you know all that. I know all about tragedy. Vladimir Jankélévitch at the Sorbonne, 1959-1960. Towards well-advised immediacy. That is one means among others, the mean of means. For if the means are humble means... Mr Eskenazy, Habiba's taking an evening off. She may not be back tomorrow. There's soup on the stove, emergency numbers by the phone and her pills in the kitchen. Open the windows when the rain stops. And turn off the light once she's asleep. Oh, yes, do a wash. She's out of clean clothes. You need washing powder. Try the Arab shop around the corner. Just a second. Excuse me. Stay. Simon? I'd like to understand. There's nothing to understand. Ok, Yankele? The Auschwitz Club is there. Where's the restroom? Back there. Here we go. He ate kosher. Simon! I'm walking! It hardly hurts anymore! Ask me to dance. Careful! Let's drive away together To the south of Italy Remember? And see life bathed in blue Stake everything on a bet And all night dance the calypso In a dance-hall by the Arno - It still hurts a bit. - Careful! I washed and dressed alone. Just imagine. Isn't your mother beautiful? I'll leave here in a day or two. Do you mind? You're dumping me? You have to manage alone. You're a big boy. I'm happy you've found someone good at last. I'll let you live what you need to live with Mikhaël. You know you can cry for joy? Raphaël. - What's the big occasion? - No reason. Hands off! A woman never pours champagne. Veuve Cliquot 2006. That doesn't fit the bill. To my mother's departure! To Bella! Can I have a robe? Put some music on. No klezmer, ok?! I don't know what. Nothing in that case. I was thinking... With Mum gone, you'll be unemployed. So? Throwing me out? - That's not what I meant. - What then? Forget it, I was being funny. I don't get your humour. I can sleep in my sister's kitchen. I don't need you. I can't force you to give. The world's a big place, so screw you! You're so smart but you think I'm just a cheap slut! One egg or two? You want an egg? I can't cry. I almost feel relieved. It's weird. I've prepared for this but it's not going the way I imagined. Is it bad, doctor? Forgive me. - Lekhaim! - To life! Shit, that's strong! It'll do you good to get away. Get caught up in your work, otherwise... you'll wallow in gloom. I know you. A triumph in New York... It's... the best gift you could give her. - Want to see the CD cover? - Now? This is so hard for you, dear. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. We forgot the ice. What do I do? He mustn't wallow in gloom. He has a tendency to. I think he's a lot stronger now. Have you known each other long? Naïm is my best safeguard against gloom. Excuse me a second. - Why didn't you say? - You never asked. I couldn't know. You could have guessed. Mum speaks French to me. You're a crafty one! Do you speak Yiddish? I'm sorry... I wanted everything to be perfect. It's Dad. He's old. He doesn't understand. I just met him! First I can't see my son, then I can, now I can't again? What am I in all this? A schmuck! Yankele! After the crow flies back to New York, we'll see Yankele when we want. So he has to lie to his family? I'm sure Rosalie likes me. She doesn't care. Nothing to say? She's on their side? She doesn't decide? I don't believe that. Can't they see you need your son now your mother's gone? What will you do? The Arab has to go, is that it? It's not that. It's not them or Yankele. It's me. I need to live alone, Naïm. I've been thinking. Why don't we live together? Cut it out. You're alone, I'm alone... We're getting old... Let me through. This place is too small for you. Move in with me. Stop it... Or... we go to New York. Right now. We fly there tomorrow. We spend two weeks together... Before the concert. We get two rooms at the Sheraton... We call room service... And we go to read in Central Park. You aren't going to puke? I know. Are you staying after? Yes, of course. Excuse me... I love your handbag. Don't you remember me? You find this funny? His mother's spitting image... Shall we dance? You bet. Marry me. Too bad! Wait! Too late. Too bad. You've got a nerve... She's a lucky girl. She's desperate. Will you dance with me? You know her? Take me to Venice. Ok, if you want. Liar! Don't worry, I'm not drunk. Forget Venice. It stinks. I prefer New York. Don't worry. I know you won't take me anywhere. Do you have a room free? Only the presidential suite, sir. I'll take it. Thank you. It's just for one night. - How much is it? - 4,000 euros. This is good. We're safe here. You're not taking any risks. No one will hear our cries here, Simon Eskenazy. I love Paris. So, how was I? At the synagogue, with the scarf, you looked Jewish. All the women were jealous. And after? All the men were watching you. When? When you danced. Everyone forgot the newlyweds. They only saw you. When I danced with Rosalie, how was it? For me, very moving. The others fell for it? Rosalie was the only one who realized. If she realized, something wasn't quite right. Was it my make-up? I used too much foundation. The light was too bright. No, it's not that. Rosalie saw the way I looked at you and she understood. I've been meaning to ask you something... Why do you use such big breasts? I have no others. Know how much they cost? No, no idea. They're too showy? They make me look common? Well, yes. But, actually, I like them. If Rosalie realized, everyone did. I looked ridiculous? They were laughing behind my back? Tell me the truth! It's my voice. It broke? I know it broke. You didn't hear me? I'm common. I'm so common. I'm ashamed. It's terrible. They must all be laughing. Why didn't you stop me? Cut it out, Naïm. Cut it out. Stop it. It's over. Yes, I know it's over. I've known a long time. You never believed in it. No one does. But I know who Angela is. The others are all pigs. Want to know who Angela is? The world's most beautiful woman. Go ahead, try to deny it. You bust my balls. Angela is the world's most beautiful woman and you're Naïm, so stop pissing me off. Wait... It's too soon. Sorry. Forgive me. I love Angela and I love Naïm too. You love him? I love you. I'm sorry... Honey, I couldn't resist... It was on sale, but not cheap. I had to try it on. I couldn't just buy it. You're not mad at me? Subtitles: Ian Burley Subtitling: C.M.C.
