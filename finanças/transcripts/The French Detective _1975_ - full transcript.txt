Goodbye, Copper Unified Republican Party Good evening, doctor. How did this happen? Christine! She was with the gentleman when... The officer asked how it happened. Well, normally. Not all your customers die. What do you mean by "normally"? He didn't want anything special. We both got into bed... He wasn't moving... He was dead. So it was accidental. There's nothing more to say. - Was he a regular? - Yes, he came a lot. He was nice. I'd like to have a quick word, Superintendent. I just wanted to say I was good friends with Mr Taillefer. And Mr Laffont. And I have excellent relations with Mr Roux and Mr Dupuis. And I often see President Langlane. He's a charming man. It's only us missing out! No Smoking Oh yes, sorry. So how come? Why aren't we getting paid off? I hope that'll change. You'll get half - you're the boss, after all. We'll split the rest. Right? There you go! Our future's sorted out! An old duffer dies in a brothel, fortune smiles on us, life can begin - thank you Jesus! Don't you get bored? He loves playing the corrupt American cop. That's his routine. You poor guy. It's tough. - See you tomorrow. - Goodnight. Write the report. I don't care who that woman knows. Leave it to me. - Goodnight. - Like a drink? Not tonight, I'm exhausted. Bye. The boss was nice. I'd do her. It'd be nice in that electric bed, blowing the fuses. Not in the car, for Christ's sake! Don't start! - Just wait. - Open the window. - Just open the window! - No! - Come on, put it out. - No way! I've already thrown 20 out today. A whole packet. You gave up three days ago, but I'm smoking this. Think about your lungs! You'll have tar like that. You druggy! Stop! Stop the car! Wait two minutes! Stop the car! I'll drop you off. You can't walk... I'm smoking! Bye! You're going to die! And I'll laugh! Calling all cars, there's a fight at Boulevard de la Gare. This is Moitrier. I'm on my way. - With Lefèvre? - No, he's smoking. Stop, for God's sake! Oh my God! Stop! Police! Stop! Get out, hands up. I recognized him, it was Portor. It was Portor. Give me a cigarette. Is the coffee coming? Put a roadblock at Montcoulèche. That's the guy that shot him. Antoine Portor, one of Lardatte's heavies. The boss wants a roadblock at Montcoulèche. Here's the coffee. Thanks. Hey, does Antoine Portor have a brother? Yes, but he's not involved. He was at the office. Yes? Moitrier's dead. Martin. Beyond Political Parties Pierre Lardatte Your brother's a killer. If you hear anything, tell me. A clear vision of reality! A dynamic understanding of things! An approach that's straightforward and direct - modern, in short! That's what you can expect from me! Beyond Political Parties Pierre Lardatte That's what you can expect from me, that's what I can promise you, formally and solemnly. Hello, Superintendent. I've just heard the news. How awful. Can I see you for a moment? It's not the best time, but say what you need to say. Portor had just left prison when you took him on. I didn't "take him on". What? Come on. You see those two thugs by the door? Those two over there look as bad. They work for me. Do you think we're friends? I'm coming. Do you think we're close? I don't recruit my security. I'm too busy. I'd never heard about Portor. As if I'd vouch for people like... I'm coming. I'll tell the examining magistrate and the press. My sincerity won't be in doubt. But let me tell you this, I expect you to catch the criminal and for him to be punished. Let me know if I can help with anything else. Good day, Superintendent. Lardatte, Lardatte, Lardatte! Marie Portor, aged 30, clean record, wife of Antoine Portor. My husband didn't come home this morning - I can't help you. You can help him. He killed a cop. He could get shot. Tell me where he is and he can stand trial. I told you, I don't know. Don't count on Lardatte. Portor is on his own now. We'll take him out. So think. I can't help. Mr Ledoux is asking for you, boss. You know what an accessory to murder gets? 5 to 10 years. Have a seat, Verjeat. - So? - I saw Moitrier's widow. This is terrible. But it's a sensitive case. Let's share the work. You do Portor, I'll do Lardatte. Gangsters and politicians are different. You'll have to explain that to me one day. I'm serious - we need to tread softly with Lardatte. That's not your style. What about Lardatte? He campaigns with a revolver. The magistrate was happy to believe Lardatte didn't know Portor. - Really? - That's enough, Verjeat. I'm trying to make life easy. You'll have your work cut out with Portor. The dead billsticker. Yes. His father wants to see me. - He should see you. - Why? Because Lardatte killed his son. - Mr Lardatte? - He gets in at 10am. The star. How nasty. At the town hall - on wedding day. - Hello, Pignol. - Hello. Lardatte wants to see you. Can I talk to him now? Come on. Hello, Mr Lardatte. We can't let these people get hurt. I hear you can disarm them without violence. I'd be very grateful. That's all I have to say. Over to you. I understand. Disarm them - gently. Bloodshed would ruin your campaign. What's your plan? He called me. What? To know what we'd found out. Yes, I know he's upset, but it's not my fault, as I told the investigation. I don't have to explain! I just want those men out of my office with no fuss! Get to work, Verjeat. Outside, Commissioner. Don't push it, Verjeat. He's angry. Pignol tried to put men on the roof. Get me a direct line to Lardatte's office. A direct line to Lardatte's office. - Are you going to talk? - It's ringing. I'll try to calm him down. Move the police back. Right away. No answer? It's Superintendent Verjeat. - So? - He's trying to calm him down. I know why you're there, Mercier. To identify your son's killers. I've got a loudspeaker on my car. Can you hear me? Yes. Let's make a deal. Talk for 5 minutes, then give yourself up. I don't get it. Just talk into the telephone - it'll come through, loud and clear. I don't believe you. Ask one of your sons to try. Give him the phone, come forwards. Speak. Speak! What do I say? Oh my God! Lardatte is a bastard and a killer! What's going on? Scum and a killer! My son was killed by Lardatte's men. Jail Lardatte! Jail Lardatte! He's responsible for my son's death! They're trying to hush things up, but I want revenge for my son! Jail Lardatte! Can you turn it up a bit? - It's maxed out. - Murderer! What is this? He was putting posters up. He had no money. Like Lardatte's thugs. - Are you mad? - I'm calming him down. He's a murderer! Lardatte is a murderer! A murderer! - Stop this. - You said to disarm him peacefully. I order you to stop this, immediately. That's enough, now, Mercier. The loudspeaker's off. Now, listen to me, I'm coming up, unarmed. OK? I've got nothing to say! - We had a deal. - Nothing! Let's talk for 5 minutes. I've got nothing to say. You're a sell-out! I'll shoot! He's coming. Shit! Don't move. Stay back, or I'll shoot. Put that down, Mercier. Calm down. What have you got against me? You're all working for Lardatte. Lardatte's not my biggest fan, right now. Thanks for the gun. In exchange, I'll give you my word: I'll investigate. Lardatte's in trouble. He's beyond reproach. To the press, he's a super cop - a hero. They'll like it here. The park, the trees... It's modern and clean, with a nice building. Unfortunately, there aren't enough places, President. The elderly never get their due. So, isn't it nice here? That's sunshine is good. Will you vote on Sunday? Eh? Sunday? Don't forget. You have to vote. Yes. And about my problem, President... Do you see a solution? Maybe, yes. This Verjeat is so good, he should be rewarded. Yes. - You called, Director. - Yes. - Verjeat is leaving. - What? Verjeat is going. I thought you could replace him. He doesn't know yet. Thanks, Pignol. Vote for Lardatte. Your friend's hard at it. He needs to win back the votes you lost him. Vote for Lardatte. Ass out, American style. All that's missing is the majorettes. Vote for Lardatte. Did you know, they cut down trees to print rubbish like this? And trees make chlorophyll. And chlorophyll makes oxygen. He's campaigning with our trees. That's not bad. Every leaflet costs oxygen. Stop your nonsense. Lardatte's destroying our oxygen! Bastard! He's stopping us from breathing - help! I won't vote for him! You're a real drag. - ZR2, over. - I've got Mr Ledoux. - What are you working on? - Portor, still. We've found one of his accomplices. Keep me posted. He's been here since he's been on the run. He only goes out to walk. He stretches his legs for 20 minutes and then shuts himself up again. Maybe he'd be no worse off in prison. I don't want my son to get killed. Can I have a cigarette? - I was waiting. - I just got here. - Carry on. - Yes. Here. He works with Portor. He says he's around. Sit down, Verjeat. Here. Thanks. Is there a problem? I've got good news and bad news. Let's start with the bad. You're leaving the squad. That's bad for me too. I'm losing a good man. Now, the good news. You've been promoted, to Controller General in Montepellier. It's come from above. What is this bullshit? This bullshit, as you put it, is the echo of that loudspeaker the other day. Remember? When do I leave? Next Monday. And Portor? Your successor will take over. Moitrier was one of my men. - I'll go in two weeks. - Impossible. You acted badly at the town hall. You used that poor guy to insult Lardatte. Work has to come before your feelings. You'll leave as arranged and you can consider yourself lucky. Verjeat. We'll have a leaving party. Neither of us want it, but it's the tradition. My lighter, Director. Thanks. Lefèvre. I think that's it. OK, back to it. What's up? - What's this? - Shiva's Witnesses. - They're protesting. - Why? We took one in for obstruction, so they all turned up. - Get them out. - I need reinforcements. Loser. What? Get out of here. You'd be in good shape if you did that every day. Where to? Lardatte got me. I have to leave Rouen. I'm going to Montpellier. He's sharp. I've been promoted. You can't refuse a promotion. There you go. Lardatte and Ledoux are both fuckers. - Not Ledoux. - He's an idiot. I'd have called if I'd had news. I saw you two days ago. Give me time to breathe. Neither of us have time. I need Portor within 48 hours. I can't help you. I don't where he is. It leaves marks! Will someone keep him? He'll be big when you get out. He won't even recognize you. He'll bite you. Sergio is in town. He worked with Portor in the past. - He might know something. - Where is he? Try at Moissa's. Here. I'd resign. Those fuckers don't deserve you! What would you live off? Whatever. Like all the rest that resign. Are you just going to go quietly? - It's almost bed time. - Or time to get up. He's in town. He came round yesterday. - His name's Sergio. - Never seen him. Make me a coffee. He looks different. He came round. For a drink. He didn't say anything. He may be with Lautrin! - What was that Gestapo act? - Good fun! Anyone there? Two days isn't long. So what's your plan? I need time to think. See you later. Hey, boss. Yes? You should go. - You should. - You've changed your tune. - You should go. - Why? Don't get angry. Go on. You're the kind of guy that'd take a stand and they're not worth it. Really? You still stand by all that old stuff. Honour. Duty. That stuff has ruined people for centuries. - What do you value? - Nothing. It's not about me. You've got no chance against Lardatte. What if I've got a dream? What? What if I think I've got a chance? - You'll suffer. - Yes. He'll crush you. Yes, but it'll be fun. At my age, that counts. Hello, ZR2? Hello, ZR2? - ZR2, over. - Burglary at Lardatte's. 84 Quai des Marchands. Burglary... - Hello. - Mr Lardatte. No, two people maximum. A red R16 was reported, with Saône-et-Loire plates. Don't forget the Montcoulèche roadblock. Yes, thanks. - Hello. - Hello. So? Nothing much. My accountant will tell us. Stop Police Shit! The police! Stop Toll This is new! Hello, Superintendent. - Lardatte was burgled. - Mr Lardatte? Burgled? When? Last night. Where were you? I ate with friends and slept at my mother's. That's all I know, Inspector. You can check. Your brother's wife isn't at home. Where is she? Marie? She slept at my mother's too. She was there all night. I just left. It's nothing to do with us. ZR2! - ZR2, over. - A road accident. A red R16 ran the roadblock. 3 people: 2 men and a woman. We've found Marie. - Hello Superintendent. - Captain. The others are dead. We found this. Is that it? Let's have a chat. Come on. They did it so Lardatte would help my brother. He needed money. Lardatte said there was no money there. But there were his accounts. And he wouldn't want people to see those. - Lefèvre! - Yes. I don't want the press to know the accounts got burnt. If Portor thinks we've got them, we may see him again. Antoine Portor Wanted for Murder Fill it up, fast. Both men died. Marie Portor went into surgery. Did you find what they stole? No, we'll question Portor's wife when she can talk. - Open up! - What do you want? - Are you crazy? - Open up! Hello. She's still unconscious. - What's the prognosis? - Not good. Portor may show up. I've got a car out at the front. Tell your successor. Don't forget the party. I won't. See you later. So, everything OK? Sedate him! They send a nurse and she's a lesbian! These dressings are so hot! This won't take long. They'll wait 3 days before announcing she's dead. To your promotion, Verjeat. And now I'll hand over to the man who'll be trying to fill your shoes. Superintendent Pignol. It's a challenging privilege to replace you, Verjeat. Men move on, but the mission remains. I'll do my best. I'll take your team in hand and I hope we'll work well together. Right, boys? I propose a toast. It's empty. Have a refill, Pignol. Where's this going? You're lying to journalists, you've got a fake invalid, the boss doesn't know. - Where's it going? - Are you scared? No, I've got nothing to lose. You're the Chief Superintendent. And you're young. This might be a bad idea. What's so funny. I'm Chief Superintendent, I'm 50, but at 25 you sound like my dad. - No, no, that's a bit much! - Lefèvre! What? You don't believe in duty, honour or legality, you've cut corners since we met, so don't lecture me. I'm not lecturing. Don't spoil my fun. Just go with it! Why don't you try to enjoy it, too? OK. We're closed. Tell your boss Inspector Lefèvre is here. I took the liberty... I took the liberty of bothering you because I need to finish my report on the recent death. Yes. The boss asked me to charge the maximum. - What's his name? - Verjeat. Superintendent Verjeat. But there's nothing you can do. He's leaving. - Oh? - He was transferred. He's furious. He's angry with everyone. Especially you. Why's that? I don't know. He's not in his right mind. May I. Yes. Thanks. Your friends can't pressure him now he's leaving. It's a nuisance. Why are you telling me? I can do something. I could intervene. Really? Yes. You're nice. It's true. I could see that straight away. I wouldn't like to cause you trouble. I like women with class. And you've got it. - How do you like me? - Sorry? People usually like me. - Can I have some more? - Yes. Wouldn't you like to sleep with a virile young man? - No. - Then let's leave it. - What can we discuss? - How much? - What? - I said how much? - Shit! - What's wrong? - My cigarette! - Don't shout. That's the second time! Where's that cigarette? Unbelievable. An emergency! So? - Everything OK? - No. It's serious. Martin burned his trousers. What a disaster. - A road accident? - Yes. I'll get the surgeon. When's Lefèvre coming? He should have arrived by now. I'm going to bed. Yes. An ambulance has been reported missing. There's one that's still there. Go! Get a move on! Go! Crime squad! Open up! Get the nurse out! Got it! You need to go. He came from the left. A broken collarbone! - No big deal. - It's bad! - Yes. - Right. When I get home tomorrow... Watch out! Shit! My leg! Take it easy. Stop, stop! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! He's hit, badly. He's good there. Call the surgeon. Portor's proved he cares about his wife. Keep the guard. Pignol is taking over now. I've got another week. Why wasn't Lefèvre there? I'll ask him. Lefèvre, come on. What were you doing last night? Sorry, I went home to get some rest and then... I didn't wake up. Stupid! I'll let you tell Ledoux about that. - What's that? - My report. So you had a snooze. What was the sandman's name? Just his first name - not his surname. - Give me a break. - What is this shit? So she's letting rooms now? Maybe she's tutoring people in religion, too. It's Inspector Lefèvre. I'm sorry, but my report didn't work. My report didn't work. The boss said no. I have to fill it out properly. It wasn't my fault. Excuse me! Excuse me, Madam! Judge Delmesse? First floor, on the left. Marthe Rigaux, aged 35, 15 Rue de la Poste. Inspector Lefèvre accuses you of pimping. - And bribing a police officer. Sorry? You can add another charge: bribing a police officer. - Lefèvre? - Yes. Lefèvre. She says she paid him. - Impossible. - Well, she says she did. The judge is speaking to Lefèvre. This is annoying. And I know the judge. It's Delmesse. He's an idealist. He's a shit-stirrer. It'll go badly, if Lefèvre did anything. You know why you're here. Marthe Rigaux says she bought your silence. That's not true. Miss Rigaux is naturally suspicious. She noted the serial numbers of the banknotes. I hope we won't find them in your account or at home. She didn't buy me. She might have given me a gift or two. - Gifts! Yes, to maintain our friendship... And you see nothing untoward in a friendship between a policeman and a pimp? Not at all. It's part of the job. We find informants in bars, at race courses and in brothels. Not in nunneries. Tell me the difference between a little gift and a bribe. - What? - Thank you, that'll be all. But nothing much could happen over a few trinkets. I want to press charges, as an example. Charges? That'll be all. Do you think it's just me? The higher up you go, the more it costs! Do you realize the gravity of your words? Why should it be just me that pays? One of the hospital guys is dead, one's in a coma, but the third was just shot in the arm. Hi. You piece of shit. What's going on? - Are you crazy? - I need a word with him. Get in my office, both of you. - What's going on. - No idea. Calm down, Verjeat. Now, answer, why did you accuse Verjeat? - I didn't. - Don't lie, it's childish. Delmesse just told me. I want a straight answer. Was it to win the judge over or is he really guilty? I didn't accuse anyone. OK. Now I'm asking you. Did you take bribes, as Lefèvre says? No. I can't believe it. That such suspicion should fall on you. I can't believe it. I've done nothing. Be under no illusion, the truth will out. Delmesse won't let go of you now. He's obsessed with police corruption. If you're guilty... I want to believe you're innocent. Go back to work, as before. But with a bit more dignity. You've made quite a spectacle of yourself. This is a first, in 30 years. It's absolutely pitiful. Go. Superintendent Verjeat Accused of Corruption? Stay here. I don't need you. Verjeat, Verjeat... Corrupt, corrupt... Where's Portor? You're in a mess. Right. So are you, from what I hear. I'll get the maximum. Maybe we'll share a cell, Superintendent. Let me remind you why you're here. Marthe Rigaux paid money to Inspector Lefèvre, who says he gave most of it to you. To quote Lefèvre: "I got a tip, Verjeat took most of it." I'll let you explain. You believe that rubbish? I don't advise taking that tone, Superintendent. Lefèvre's statement is crushing. Lefèvre is scum. Your stature is greater. He's small. He wouldn't cost much. A pair of shoes, a chain, a scarf. I wouldn't think you're as cheap. You have no proof. I will have. I have Lefèvre's statement. Men like you dishonour the police, Verjeat. You're crooks. That's it for today. Thank you. I'm going to Montpellier tomorrow. Impossible. We need to investigate your case fully. You'll stay till we conclude. OK. One more thing. Portor killed one of my men. Can I pursue the case? It's no gift. Yes, you can. Thanks. Private Is there anyone upstairs? - No. - Let's go. I'm staying. No kidding. Have you got a beer? - Are you OK? - I'm fine. I'm eating mash through a straw, but otherwise, fine. Thanks. I didn't believe it. That's not all. Lardatte called. You see? We can keep dreaming. My call was a surprise, but I knew you had troubles. I wanted to say that despite the suspicions, many people still respect you. You'd be surprised to hear I'm one of them. - Thanks, but... - Don't thank me. Hard times show who your real friends are. You know, you're not alone. Delmesse is the judge, right? Yes, Delmesse. I'll see what I can do. It won't be easy, but I can try. But, why are you doing this for me? I'll scratch your back and one day you'll scratch mine. It may not even take too long. - I see. - All in good time. I'll help you first. I'll call you in a week. Very good. There, he's hooked. All we have to do is reel him in now. Like that. Nice and easy and then land him. That's nice work. That's a plate of fish, not a dustbin. OK. Do you want to eat? No, I'm adopting it and taking it home. Bill me and go away. It's all looking pretty good. It'll be hard to corner him. I said, he's hooked. It'll be easy. He wants to get his accounts back and he needs you to do it. It couldn't be clearer. You're dreaming now. Excuse me, same again. - Haven't we had enough? - No, we're celebrating. Do you need anything, Superintendent? I'm just getting some fresh air. What a life, eh? No? Why did you join the police? Because I was lazy, because... I couldn't do anything else. I'm the same. I've been a cop 24/7 for 30 years and... and I don't know why either. I end up at 5am with a guy who's going to do the same thing and end up alone, like me. Fortunately. Just think... a copper's wife, waiting at home with a mutton stew. No, we're kings! Alone. Free. We're going to get Lardatte. We're the best. I like mutton stew, myself. You say you paid 50,000 francs to Mr Lefèvre here, to write an accommodating report. Yes, Your Honour. Thank you. You may go. Nice police force. Some policemen are honest. There are two sorts. Some do politics, other don't. The first don't risks. They don't end up dead or in here. They get information on everyone and they're untouchable. I don't do politics or horde information. But they got me over that loudspeaker. Save it for court, Superintendent. You can go. Not you, Inspector. One day I'll tell you how it is, doing this job. What now? I've got nothing to say. Your successor, Pignol, came to see me. I deal with him now. I'll lie down for real cops, not you. So, total silence. The informants won't talk. No one knows anything. Right? Martin. You didn't see anything. Nor did you. Same for you. Thank you, gentlemen. Boss. We've found Portor. We're going in tonight, with Pignol. Did Pignol say to keep me out? - Ah! - I need a word, Pignol. Aren't you moving a bit fast? You've moved in on my people. I don't mind and I'll prove it. You know how? We'll arrest Portor together. Thanks, but I've got a plan. No you don't, Pignol. We need him alive. I know your plan. The cops pile in and Portor will end up heavy as lead. We'll use my plan. Ledoux put me in charge. The judge didn't and Ledoux will defer. - The judge... - Let's go. - It's your day of glory. - Where? A gunfight, like in the westerns. Portor against us. The fastest draw wins. What? I'm not going to get shot. You've got nothing to lose. I'm doing OK. I need Portor alive, do you hear? Either come with me or sit down, like you normally do. Superintendent Pignol is a bit tired. I'm going to deal with Portor. Shit! Ransac! Help Ransac. Lefèvre, get him! Don't shoot! Shit! OK, carry on. Call back here. They're searching all the buildings. - Ransac will make it. - Thanks. I need a word, Verjeat. You too, Lefèvre. Pignol went to see Portor's wife. Are you crazy? You concealed a death and dragged your officers into this macabre farce! Have you lost your mind? - Listen... - Shut up! I'm not interested! You kept me in the dark. Now keep quiet! I'm going to take care of you! And that idiot in those bandages. He can keep them. He can get a job playing a mummy. Now get out! If Delmesse wasn't on your case already, I'd deal with you, no messing! There'll be no charges. The whole thing was made up. - What? - I staged the whole thing. A bailiff has the money. - What? - I had a dream. I wanted Portor and Lardatte, together. The killer and the model citizen. Now you're proving I had no chance. I'm not proving anything. Your methods are unacceptable. Our ideas about police work differ. Leave for Montpellier, now. If Delmesse presses charges for wasting his time, I won't stop him. And Portor? That's for Pignol and the Rouen police. You're in Montpellier. Get it? Portor has got Lardatte, as a hostage. Oh my God. The house is surrounded. What do we do? - Want some? - No thanks. Let's take a walk. Give up, Portor. You've got no chance. Be reasonable, Portor. Verjeat! - Let me speak to Verjeat. - This is Pignol. Talk to me. - Bring me Verjeat. - Speak to him, Verjeat. This is Ledoux, head of the crime squad. Talk to me, Portor. I want Verjeat! Verjeat, speak to him! He'll kill me! - Verjeat! Do you hear? - Speak to him. No silly stuff. I want a car and no police around! - Do you hear, Verjeat? - Go on. Verjeat's in Montpellier! Goodbye, copper. Subtitles: ECLAIR
