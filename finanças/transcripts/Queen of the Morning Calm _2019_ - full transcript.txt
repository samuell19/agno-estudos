(match striking) Did I ever tell you the story of when Daddy and I first met? MONA: Tell me. When I was a little girl my mother took me to see a fortune teller. He told me that my destiny was to travel over great water to find the love of my life. (ethereal music) DEBRA: As soon as I saw him, I knew. My true love.

Right now? Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. (gentle score) (deep sigh) - Mona! - PRINCIPAL: Miss Choi? What happened? Sorry. (score fades out) PRINCIPAL: Miss Choi, do you know where Mona might have access to cigarettes? No, I don't know. Ow! PRINCIPAL: Because we caught her with cigarettes trying to smoke and, uh, the other girls... They're a bad influence. They make her do something like this, but that's not Mona. Well, actually, they all said that it was Mona who had the cigarettes. (office phone rings) No! And Mona tells me that you are a smoker. (exhale) I'm a social smoker. She's been getting into fights and telling the other girls that she's not a virgin. (Debra stammers) Again, the other girls, they make her do stuff like this but it's not true. I'm afraid I need to suspend Mona for one week. Mona, will you give me a moment with your mother? (door closes) This has been happening repeatedly with Mona this year. Uh, I've tried calling you to discuss this and the, um... virginity thing. The next time she's down here, I'm going to have to call Children's Services. No! I'll punish her when I get home! I mean, you can even punish her more if you want. I've also been made aware about your choice of work. It might actually be the most Christian decision for her. - You took the money! - Stop! Then where is it? You told him where it was. MONA: I don't know what you're talking about, you crazy! And now I have to take you with me. Great. (traffic) (car horns) (dog barking) Okay. Hands. Ah! Hot! Hold still. Your hands are dirty! Ah! Okay, enough! Okay, relax! Lock it. (lock engages) (bathroom door opens) (sigh) (busy office sounds) (gentle score) TRACY: Harriet? TRACY: Debra?

We're thrilled to support the Diverse Women At Work Initiative. We'd love to hear why you think you're the best candidate for the job? (office phone rings) This is my dream to be an office intern. I'm really good with numbers. Oh, that's great to hear! (giggling) Ah! Ah! TOBY: Ah, seriously, we'd like to hear why you're the best candidate. Yes. I practice typing every day. I'm typing 80 words per minute now. NANCY: Good. I'm also a team player and I know Quickbooks. I'm just one course away from getting my degree in bookkeeping. We have programs that will assist you in getting your diploma. I'm so excited to be here. TOBY: That's fantastic. NANCY: So when would you be able to start if you were to get the job? TOBY: We'd like you to start right away, if possible. NANCY: Yeah. DEBRA: Of course. I can start right away. - TOBY: Oh, that's fantastic. - NANCY: Great. TRACY: So sorry to interrupt but this child says she belongs to you? Um... yes, Mona. She's my daughter. TRACY: She was in the bathroom, by herself. She flooded the toilet. MONA: She abandoned me. No, I told her to wait! Why isn't this child in school? I can explain! I was suspended. I didn't have anyone! I don't know where my husband is. MONA: It's because I'm not a virgin. TOBY: Uh, okay. Thank you for coming in. Um... Someone will be in touch. I just left her for a little bit. I mean, she's already ten. MONA: I'm nine. NANCY: Thank you for coming in! DEBRA: Will you let me know? TOBY: Thank you. (office phone rings) NANCY: Okay. Okay, who's next? SAM: I'm sorry, Debra. They want me to padlock the door. Oh, please... There's nothing I can do about it. I can give you a minute to gather your stuff. Can we go back to your apartment? We can talk about it. I'll figure something out. I can't. Debra, I'm just a super. (deep sigh) (dog barking in distance) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone hangup tones) (deep sigh) SAM: You have to hurry. (Mona makes whirring noise with fake lip toy) DEBRA: Stop it, Mona. Stop it, Mona. (louder whirring noises) Stop! Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!! (heavy breaths) (repeated loud whirring sounds) DEBRA: Stop it! Stop. Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!!! Hey! (gentle score) You okay? Come on. Come inside. Come on. Come. Here you go. It's nothing special, but it's clean. Just let me know if you need anything else. Hey. Morning. I hope sunny side up is okay? It's perfect. Thank you. So, I was thinking of looking for an apartment and a job today. Do you know anyone who would be able to watch Mona? The Sarge... IAN: I could use some help in the shop. I know you're looking for some kind of office work. I can't pay more than minimum wage, but I figure that maybe then the stay here could be part of the pay. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. (gentle score) Right here: you forgot the tax. Right. So, um... What happens is I just try and figure out the tax later. You kinda need it. It's important. I could do this for you if-if you want. - Could you? - Yeah. MONA: Hey. FREDDY: What are you doing here? We got kicked out of our apartment. You staying with Ian, that weirdo? Hi, Principal Fisher. This is Debra Choi, Mona's Mommy. I'm just calling to let you know that I just got a job as an accountant-bookkeeper at a store so you don't have to call Children's Services, or anything like that and I just wanted to let you know. Okay. Bye. FREDDY: You can't stay with that guy. I heard he killed somebody. - MONA: What? - FREDDY: Yeah. He killed some guy in a fight. I know what: you let me and my Uncle Derek in there I'll take all his money. Then you and your Mom could escape with it. Where you going? Nowhere. DEBRA: I'm glad you like it. I'm sure she'll say yes. FEMALE CUSTOMER: Thanks. (plastic bag crinkling) Smells like old man in here. When are we leaving? Mona, we're staying. Mom, he's a murderer. Stop. He killed some guy and his wife and daughter - and stuffed them in the freezer. - Sh! Mona. Mom, he could try to kill us! I don't want to hear this! You're just jealous because Dad trusts me and he doesn't trust you! She'll be back. IAN: Another amazing meal. Oh, it's nothing. It's just a little Korean food. Hm. You know, I had a little girl, too. No, I didn't know that, Mr. Ian. Yeah. She's not well now. DEBRA: I'm sorry. IAN: Mm-hm. (Mona scoffs) Mona, apologize! I'm sorry. I don't know what's gotten into her. Apologize. No! I won't! He's a murderer! Mona! Mona! (door closes) (gentle ethereal score) MONA: I need to find my dad. FREDDY: Let's ask my uncle. He knows everybody. MONA: Okay. Sure. MONA: Why is he in the park at night? FREDDY: He does business here. DEREK: What are you doing here, you shit? FREDDY: Hey, Uncle Derek. This is my friend, Mona. DEREK: Your girlfriend. You two doing it? FREDDY: Yeah, totally. MONA: Shut up! That's disgusting! FREDDY: She's looking for her dad. - FREDDY: Ah. - MONA: The Sarge? You know him? DEREK: Yeah. Heard he got mixed up in something out east, though. Do you know when he might be coming back? DEREK: Sorry, Princess. Hey, finish rolling this for me. Why don't you, uh... come sit on Uncle Derek's lap? Huh? Hey, if she's not your girlfriend, maybe she'll be mine? (laughs) I'm not his girlfriend and I'm not your girlfriend. So what are you? A lesbian? Hey, Mona? Mona? (tense score) Mona? Mona!! Ian, Mona's missing. IAN: Mona! DEBRA: Mona! Mona!! - FREDDY: Hey! - DEREK: Real winner. FREDDY: Hey, wait! What are you doing? I'm getting out of here. But we're hanging with my uncle. MONA: I'm not. Mona! FREDDY: Oh, shit. Go! Go! Get out of here! - DEBRA: Mona! - IAN: Debra! Got her! - DEBRA: Stop! Stop it! - MONA: No! No! - DEBRA: Stop it! Mona! Stop! - MONA: No! No! MONA: I hate you! You're nothing but a whore! IAN: Ah! Mona! You okay? Let me take you for dinner tomorrow night? It's a way to say thanks. Ah, no, I... I should be thanking you. IAN: No, you're helping me with my business. Let me just give you a proper thanks. (gentle score) I'm a terrible mother. No. No, you aren't. Yeah. I am. My father died when I was young. My mother was devastated and I didn't know what to do for her. She finally remarried and we thought he was the answer to all our prayers. One night, I was sleeping and I woke up and he was in the bed next to me, touching me and telling me I was beautiful. No one had ever told me that before. It felt good. Kept happening and I was confused; kind of... floaty. I never told my mother. (gentle score) One day she was supposed to be at work but she came in and found us and she started screaming and hitting me and calling me a whore and threw me out. So, obviously, I had nowhere to go. Finally met a woman who owned a club and I started working for her. When I met him, I thought the Sarge was the best thing to happen to me. My miracle. He wanted to take care of me and he wanted the baby and... I always wanted to go to university and become an accountant. But nothing has turned out the way I wanted it to. She said God would punish me. I'm a prostitute and a whore and my daughter hates me. No, no! No, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! (sniffles) IAN: God is forgiving. (score builds) DEBRA: Oh my God! IAN: The door's still locked. DEBRA: Mona! Mona! IAN: So nothing was taken. Front and back doors still locked. IAN: There we go. As good as new. My wings! I mended them for you. What do you say Mona? (distant police siren) Mona? I don't know what to do with her. She was an accident. The Sarge was so happy. You miss him. No, I don't! I don't! Well, she misses him. Mona? I did it. I destroyed your shop. And I stole these things. I don't deserve these. IAN: Well... I fixed these for you. I wish my daughter was as strong as you. (gentle score) (train bell clanging) (adding machine whirring) So I went back over the last eight years and I calculated what you owe and what you can write off so now it balances out and you don't owe the government anything. So you just saved my business. Yep. TAMMI: Debra! Hi! DEBRA: Hi! Where the fuck have you been? I've been working at the pawnshop. - Ian? - Yeah. You shacking up with him? No. It's not like that. No, it's different. TAMMI: Different how? What is he, a priest? No. I, um... been helping him with his business. Mm-hm. - For real? - DEBRA: Yeah. (laughter) His books were a mess and anyway, I fixed it all so he doesn't have to owe anything. Shit, girl. Okay. How's, um... You know, how's Gus? You know Gus. Yeah. He's an asshole. He's not that bad. What? No. Tammi, shit. Why? It's different for you. You're good at something. Yeah and you can do it, too. Just shut the fuck up, okay. Anyway, it was good to see you. Well, it's good to see you, too. (gentle score) Welcome! SARGE: Deb. - Sarge. - I've missed you. What are you doing here? Babe, I came back for you and-and you were gone. And... You have to leave. You have to leave right now. What're you talking about? I... Who the fuck is this guy? IAN: Debra, are you all good here? - DEBRA: Yeah. - SARGE: Deb. DEBRA: Just stop it. Stop. Stop. SARGE: Look, babe, babe. You-you left but... Daddy! SARGE: Oh, ho. Ho-ho-ho-ho. Daddy. IAN: So, I'm just going to leave you two alone for a little bit. I'll be inside. (laughter) SARGE: Okay. Okay. Okay. (giggling) (Sarge vocalizing) MONA/SARGE: Ta-da! I want cupcakes. SARGE: Yeah. (laughs) SARGE: I'm going to get us a place so we can get out of here. New bedroom. New furniture. Can I get a cat? SARGE: Whatever you want babe. DEBRA: Sarge, where were you? SARGE: What do you mean? Where were you this entire time? I was looking out for us, babe. Don't be like that. I'm here, aren't I? You left us without a warning or a note. He didn't! He had a job! A secret mission! A secret mission? MONA: You weren't supposed to know! It was top secret! He could have died! - A secret mission? - I had a chance to... do something and... I ran into some trouble. Secret mission. It was for us! It's for our family. (gentle score) (doorbell jingling) When are we going home with Daddy? - Be good for Ian. - MONA: No. Listen to your mother. Come on. Why don't I make us some dinner? I, um... I thought I could take you out. Okay. Fine. (indistinct conversations) SARGE: Hey. You're all I've got, Deb. You and Mona. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you. So... you'll be here for Mona tomorrow? How much... How much longer do you want to do this? What are you talking about? This is bullshit! Do you have a job? A place to live? Look, I'm going to take care of you! Ian, he gave me a job! No, I'm not letting you work for that old fuck! No. He's kind and he's... He's caring! Yeah, yeah. Because you're fucking him! I'm not doing this anymore. I-I know about you taking Mona to the club! I could have her taken away. I could have you charged! No! No! You've got to come back to me, Debra! No! Stop it! SARGE: Debra! Debra! Open this fucking door! Debra! Debra, come back! Mona! Mona! Mommy! Daddy! Mona. Mommy, please. Please. DEBRA: Okay. Please? Come on. (gentle score) Are you happy, baby? That's all that matters. We're leaving now. Yeah. Can you manage? I'll get by. I wish I could stay. No. It wouldn't work. - Hey. - Daddy. SARGE: Oh. Come on! Thank you. Yeah. Fresh start. (gentle score) (giggling) So, you'll have to think about getting a job soon. Oh. Uh... Maybe they'll give you another chance back at the club? I'm not going back there. It's a good job. It's something you're good at. DEBRA: Yeah, I don't know if you understand, but I'm never doing that again. Okay. Ah... Well, we're going to need to think about getting some money in soon.

You-you want me to piss that money I saved away on rent? On food? It... It's my money, Deb. I don't know why you gotta be such a princess about it. I already smoothed things over with Gus. You talked to him already? Yeah, I talked to him already. You don't think I plan ahead?
