Captioning made possible by lifetime television He was here, he was here. No one was here. He was, I saw him. Sweetie, he can'tone. Hurt you anymore. He was here. Dirty Ernie was here. If you believed in ghosts, you would've seen him, too. Call me old, call me tired. You forgot mean and ugly. Oh, what gives ? You know, this is a total waste of time. Look, if Taylor thinks his partner is ripping him off and he wants to pay US to prove it, all the better. Well, I turned down a "g.Q." Underwear commercial to be here, and it was a tough choice. And a huge loss to men's fashion, huge. You know what your problem is, old man ? You got no faith in human nature. Check your mic, is it on, test, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three. How many do you see ? Two, you ? Yeah, two. Okay. See you in a minute. Careful. See anything, Jack ? Strippers, supermodels. You know, they look pretty lonely, too. You'd be bored. Just cut it out and stay sharp. That's it. Smile for the camera, boys. Move it. Hey. Put it down, put it down. Oh, oh ! Dylan ! Dylan ! Dylan ! You're a dead man ! Oh, my god. Help's on its way, Jack, okay ? I'm right here. Just be easy, just be easy. Hey, Jack, Jack, can you hear me ? Can you hear me, Jack ? Yes, Harry. I can hear you. Jack, my name is Dr. Locker. There was a gun fight, do you remember ? You've been in a coma for two weeks. The fragment that pierced your skull has lodged in a place where we can't operate. The good news is it's small enough that we can let it remain there without posing any risk. What's the bad news ? Well, the cat scan shows that there is no brain damage, but that fragment partially grazed your optic nerve. Are you saying that I'm gonna be blind, that I can't see anymore ? For now, it appears that... yes, I am sorry. I started working with someone new today. His name is Jack Fletcher. * Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack jump over the candlestick * is he a "bat" ? Bea, I told you not to call them bats, he's a c.V.I. That means... cortical vision impairment. That's right. And guess what he used to do ? I give up. He was a policeman, just like dad. Daddy was the best policeman in the whole world ! Jack reminds me a lot of him... so strong and handsome, and then suddenly so helpless. Please don't die, daddy. Please. Who's there ? Who the hell is there ? My name is Rebecca Rose. I'm from the state department of rehabilitation. I have an appointment. What for ? I work with the vision impaired. Go away, leave me alone. I'm here to help. Why did they send you here ? To tell me that everything is gonna be okay, that I'll adjust ? I'm really very good at what I do, but... If you'd rather, I'll leave. Wait... wait. You don't deserve to be talked to like that. Please just... Come back. I apologize. Apology accepted. Jack. Look, I appreciate what it is that you're trying to do, but do you think maybe we could do this another day ? It's really best if we get to work right away, Jack. Please, Rebecca, I'm just not up to it today all right. Tomorrow then. Tomorrow. * Rebecca loves Jack Rebecca loves the blind man * stop that bea, besides, he might see again one of these days. * hush little baby don't you cry * * mama's gonna sing you a lullaby * you know, bea, I think you might really like that singing class that I told you about. It would be good for you to get out of the house. I don't want to, I don't need to. That's my good little girl, that's my good little bedelia. Please, don't. Don't talk to your uncle that way ! Give me your hand. Rebecca ! Rebecca's not here, now shut up and do what I say ! No ! I wish you could get to know him, dad. You'd really like him. Leave me alone, leave me alone, go away ! Go away ! What am I gonna do about bedelia ? Turns out the vincenzos are wanted in 3 states for larceny. What about Alex, I want his ass in a sling. Yeah, well, there's an all-points, but there's nothing yet. You know, they probably skipped the state by now. Yeah, well, I just wanna be sure. Jesus, this stuff tastes like chalk. I gotta get outta here, Harry. You can't, wait a minute now, you heard what the doctor said. He wants you to hang around here for a few more days. Wants you to stick around and run some more tests on you. You stick around. I feel fine, I wanna go home. Blind and still a pain in the ass, you know ? I got some paperwork to do, so I'm gonna catch up with you a little later. Oh, hi, I'm Harry. Hi, Rebecca Rose. A nurse ? You could say that. Yeah, well, you got your work cut out for you. Don't let old blood and guts here growl at you. Hi, Jack. You're not gonna snap at me today, are you ? At the moment, I'm all snapped out. Good, well, there's a lot I have to teach you. But first I'd like to try something. I don't want you to argue with me or ask me why. I just want you to be still... And listen. I'm listening. For what ? Everything. Everything in the room. You're right. I can hear all sorts of different things. I can even... Hear the light. Whatcha doing ? Nothing. Fibber. You're trying to look pretty for that guy, right ? Bedelia, let's not do this again. It won't work. Don't you remember, the last guy just took off. Thought you were weird. Well, Benjamin didn't understand a lot of things. Anyway, it doesn't matter, he wasn't the one. There is no "one," Rebecca, it's just you and me. We have each other and that's the way things are. Besides, they're all like uncle Ernie, dirty and feely. Bedelia, all men are not like uncle Ernie. You're wrong, dead wrong ! They all want what uncle Ernie wanted and all they do is take, take, take ! Red one makes you look fat. I've had enough of this place, Harry, come on, hurry up. This is crazy. Doctor told you to stay put. You gonna talk me to death or get me outta here ? I feel like a damn guide dog. I suppose you're gonna ask me to bark, huh ? Gee, Harry, would you ? Let's go. I think I can get out of the car, Harry. I'm not a freaking invalid here. You're about to turn me into one. Watch your step. Come on. I'm all right, I just got a headache. You're okay, are you sure ? I'm fine, don't start, Harry. Okay, okay, sit down. Whatever you say. Here, I'm gonna put your pills right here by the telephone. And by the way, you got some messages. I'm sure it's just more pity calls. You know what ? I think it might be a good idea if I just camped here a while. Harry, I'm all right, go home. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm not going anywhere. I may do a little bird watching in the morning, but I'll be here. Okay, you take care. Oh, by the way, I put your bag right there in front of you on the coffee table, okay ? Okay, Fletcher. Here we go. That's okay, I'll get a towel. Where's the towel ? Where's the towel ? Jack, I can't even imagine what you've gone through. Oh, forget it, you don't have to say anything. Okay... I brought you some flowers. Thanks. So how long has it been ? Five months and a few days. But who's counting ? Ah, Amy. Jack ? Listen, I just wanna let you know that I'm back in town for a while. Would you mind ? No, I'll get it. Oh, hello. Hello. Is Jack home ? Yes. Yes, he is. Rebecca ? Rebecca, come in. Hi, Jack, I'm sorry to show up unannounced, but we had an appointment and I pass by this way every day, so I thought I would check in on you. Amy, say hello to Rebecca, she's my new personal trainer. Ah, Amy brannigan. How do you do ? I was surprised that you left the hospital, but we can certainly manage out of your house. Manage what ? Well, everything. As your orientation and mobility teacher, it's very important that I continue working with you every day. I see, so I'm prepared for my new life ofxcitement and adventure and travel, right ? Jack, I want you to meet another friend, one that will help you learn about your new environment. Well... Son of a bitch. We meet at last. Maybe I can do something to help. Oh, I'm sorry. "O and m" is conducted strictly between teacher and pupil. It's a rule. Well, Jack, we'll talk later, it was good seeing you. Thank you for coming by and thank you for the flowers. All right, well, you have me, what now ? The first thing we do is to trace all the rooms in your house by numbered footsteps. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six... this is silly. Seven... All right, I'm at the kitchen, it's eight steps, what now ? Excellent. Now do the same from the kitchen to the bedroom. I want you to memorize all those numbers by tomorrow. I'll see if I can fit it into my busy schedule. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. ... went three for four, including a three-run home run. * does my love have a name * * does she feel the same way inside * * all that I need to know * * only she can show * just give me a sign * * I know that feeling inside * * the first time she comes around * * it might take some time * for our souls to settle down * * with love on our side * I found peace of mind * Hey. Hmm ? Thanks for leaving the door open, Mr. Private eye. Makes my job of wasting you a hell of a lot easier. Son of a bitch. I'm taking you down, my friend. You hear me ? I'm gonna make you pay for killing my brother. An eye for an eye. Speaking of which, heard you're not doing so good. Heard you're blind. Got a newsflash, it's gonna get a lot darker for you. Go to hell. Yeah, I'll think about it. But my guess is you're gonna get there first. Kiss it good-bye. Ah, ah ! Who's there ? We're sorry, your call cannot be completed... * I do the feeding Rebecca ? What happened ? I can't talk about it right now. Not right now. You said last night that all men are like uncle Ernie. Well, you were right, they are... mostly. Mostly. I remember what he did to you, baby, okay. I remember how he hurt you. My friends can stay with you. They'll make you feel better. Thanks, bea. Doesn't have anything to do with that guy, does it ? You really shouldn't get involved with strangers. It always gets you in trouble. Look, Harry, I'm telling you Alex Vincenzo was in this house. He had a gun shoved up against my head. You told me that you took a lot of pills yesterday afternoon. So I'm surprised that you were even awake with all that stuff in you. What about my phone, huh ? What do I know, maybe you left it off the hook. There was someone else in that room with him. Who, hmm, what do you mean, hmm ? Okay, look, just say that I do believe you. Only, I gotta ask you this question now. Why didn't he or they take you out ? I don't know. I don't know. Have you ever heard of phantom vision, Jack ? It's a little-known anomaly that occurs in the brain of certain blind people. It triggers impressions, visions. They can be terrifying and realistic. Are you saying that I imagined last night ? Is that what you're saying ? No, not imagined exactly. It's as if your brain created an image, like if you got hit on the head, you'd see stars. No, that's not what happened, I didn't see anything. I felt helpless. Alex Vincenzo was in this house, he was right in this house. And you know what he said ? He said, "thank you for leaving the door open." When you left last night, did you shut the door behind you ? Did you lock it behind you ? Yes, Jack, I'm sure that I locked it quite securely. You know, I know you've had a lot on your mind, but... Maybe we should work with the cane. We've got a lot to cover. Lunchtime, little fishies. You can't do this to me. You can't. Well, we've mapped out your whole house. Tomorrow we'll start by feeling everything in your environment. Sounds, smells, sensations of hot and cold. These are going to be your new tools. What do you look like, Rebecca ? Are you blonde ? Brunette, redhead ? I think I'm gonna let that be my little secret for the time being. This part of the training is supposed to come later, but I guess it's okay. It's usually reserved for close friends and family. As you become more touch sensitive, you'll be able to form a picture. I guess this is a case where the imagination wins out every time. If you say so. Well... I better get going. I will see you tomorrow. Six, seven, eight, nine... I love you, Jack. I'm gonna see that you're well taken care of. I'll always be here for you, I promise. Jack, hello ? Are you home ? It's me. Are you back there in the bedroom ? Amy ? Hey, sleepyhead. How are you ? Peachy. I still have my old key, I hope you don't mind. I stopped by the store and picked up a few things for you: Cereal, coffee, and juice. You didn't have to do that. Well, I wanted to. You know, I tried to call you a couple of times. Are you not answering your phone ? You got it. Jack, I've been thinking. You know, maybe I should stay here with you for a while. Be like old times. She's right. I can almost see you. She ? Rebecca, it's a little trick that she taught me. Mmm... That feels nice. What is it, Jack ? Ah, nothing, my head hurts like hell. Would you mind getting me some aspirin out of the bathroom ? Sure. Could you do that ? Maybe we should check in with your doctor. No, no more doctors. Here you go. You really shouldn't be alone right now. I finish my last meeting tomorrow at five. I'll be here by seven with the best dinner you ever had. Home cooked. We'll call it an early birthday meal. Ah, you remembered. Unfortunately, Thursday night, I have to catch the redeye to Paris. There's this big trade show. There's no way I could get out of it. So tomorrow night, we'll just have to celebrate a few days early. That's all right. How long did you say you're gonna be gone ? Ten days. Yeah, but when I get back, we are definitely gonna spend more time together. Dinner sounds good. I'll be looking forward to it. Jack, I just saw Rebecca get in her car and drive away. No, you didn't, you couldn't have, she left a while back. Jack, I could've sworn that was her. When did you say she left ? I don't know, a couple hours ago, I guess, but I don't want to talk about Rebecca right now. Jack, she was here. Listen, I've heard what you said. Right now, I just wanna thank you for being a great friend. It's not fair. She's not the woman for you. She can't give you what you need. What is it, bedelia ? You never used to lock your door. Well, maybe I need a little privacy. Having trouble with a friend. You have your friends, I have mine. My friends are just a bunch of stupid fish. She acted bad. Dirty, bad. Dirty, bad. Can I ask you a question, just out of curiosity ? Sure. Why didn't you and Amy... I mean, she still clearly has feelings. Why didn't we ever hook up ? Well, let's just say that we both had careers that interfered with our relationship, and it was just an issue that never went away. But who knows, you know, we might get back together. Well, I didn't mean to pry. Just part of a teacher's job to understand all angles. You don't have to explain and you're not prying, I don't mind. Speaking of Amy, she said she saw your car here last night. My car ? Yeah. No, that's not possible. I was with my sister all night last night. I told her that she was wrong. Listen, I wanna show you what an expert I've become with this damn stick. Are you ready ? The "o and m" instructors are paid through the state and contracted individually, ma'am. They work primarily in the field. I'm looking for information on a particular instructor. I'm not at Liberty to give out any background information on these individuals, I'm sorry. Look I'm really just trying to confirm if one of your people is for real, her name is Rebecca Rose. Yes, Ms. Rose is one of our teachers. I'd like to know how often is she supposed to see her patients ? Our people work with patients once or twice a week. So every day would be unusual ? Would never happen. Amy ? We need to talk. Did you follow me here ? You're damn right I did, Rebecca. I'm gonna make this real short and sweet but crystal clear. I think you should leave. Oh, not until I say what I came to say. Listen, Jack has enough troubles right now. He doesn't need one more. I talked to your boss at state rehab. She tells me your daily visits to Jack are completely inappropriate. You called my boss ? So here's the deal: You stop seeing Jack as of today. I don't know what you're doing or why, and I don't care. Just back off. Coming here was a mistake, Amy. You don't love Jack. Otherwise you would've stayed with him. Why are you trying to weasel your way back into his life ? He doesn't need you. Oh, I should've taken this to Jack in the first place. I'm going to tell him right now. Don't you dare. Watch me. Hey ! Get your hands off me. You leave him alone, he is mine ! You're crazy. I just... I just wanted to talk. You made me do this ! No, Rebecca. The bat made you do this. She was gonna tell him lies. You're gonna be in big trouble, all because of him. She followed me here, I didn't have any choice. It doesn't matter, Rebecca. I don't think the police will see it that way. You have to get him out of your life, now, before something else really bad happens. Jack is none of your business, bedelia. You know what they do to killers, Rebecca ? You know what they would do to you if I turned you in ? You go ahead and tell. You know what'll happen to you ? They'll put US both away because I'll tell them that you helped me, that you were an accomplice. You would never see me again. There will be nobody to take care of you. Besides, if you ever tell anybody about any of the things that I have done, I'll hate you forever. I've got to Bury her far away from here and get rid of the car. This is Amy, leave a name and number, and I'll get back to you shortly. Yeah, Amy, it's me. It's a little after nine. You said that you'd be here by seven and you're not, so I guess you decided to take an early flight to Paris. Seems like old times, huh ? Well, give me a call when you get back or whenever, okay ? Okay, b'bye. I'm going to bed. Can I sleep with you tonight ? Not tonight, I wanna be alone. But I'm scared. Uncle Ernie, he... for god's sake, bedelia, we both know where uncle Ernest is, don't we ? 'Night, Rebecca. Come home soon ? I'll be home when I'm home, dear. Okay. But when ? Just tell me when. I don't have to answer your questions every time I leave the house. Things are gonna have to be different around here. Just tell me what time ! Please. You're doing really well, Jack, just keep finding the curb. Feel the curb, my hand is here anytime you need it. Okay ? You're doing great. That's really... whoa, whoa, whoa. You okay ? You all right ? What's the matter ? Can we go back in now ? Why, you're doing so well. My mind just isn't on this today. What's going on ? God, I feel silly. I don't wanna bother you with this. Amy was supposed to come over last night and she didn't. Early birthday thing she had planned for me and I don't know. I guess I really can't blame her. I mean, who would wanna hang out with a blind guy, right ? No, don't do that to yourself. I'm not gonna let you feel sorry for yourself. And anyway, you're not alone, not as long as you have me. Actually I would rather be alone right now, if that's okay. Is that okay ? Are you sure it's a good idea ? Yes, at this point. But, Jack, maybe you need to talk about... I wanna go back in now, is that all right ? Umm, yeah, sure. You're gonna leave me, aren't you ? Fretting about dead-and-buried Amy isn't what you're supposed to do, Jack. It's only gonna distract you from the happier times ahead. A birthday lunch at "café piccolo". Perfect first date. No, no, no, no, come back, come back. I saw light, it was momentary, but I saw it. And it wasn't that phantom vision stuff. I believe you, Jack. Has it happened again since last night ? No. The photo receptors in your optic nerve are beginning to perceive light. Now, it might take some time, but I think you're finally beginning to heal. Thank you for coming by, Rebecca. I have a surprise for you. A surprise ? I wanna take you to lunch for your birthday next week. I was thinking about café piccolo. Teacher's orders, you can't say no. I won't say no. "When in disgrace with fortune in men's eyes "i, all alone, beweep my outcast state "and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, "and look upon myself and curse my fate, "wishing me light to one more rich in hope, "featured like him. "Like him with friends possessed, "desiring this man's art and that man's scope "with what I most enjoy contented least. "Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, happily I think on thee." "Happily I think on thee," that's nice. Yes, reservation for two people tomorrow. Do you have a table by the window ? Rebecca ? Oh, excellent. All right, we'll see you at 1:00. What is it, sweetie ? One of my friends croaked. Oh, I'm sorry, bea. I'll buy you another fish tomorrow. Wanna help me Bury it ? No, I can't right now, honey, I've got some work to do, but maybe later. Lucky little fishy. Say hi to daddy. Oh, my god, bedelia. You were gonna let me die. No, no, no. Yes, you were. No, bea, I'm so sorry. You're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. Bedelia, never, never do this again. You'll take care of me, right ? Of course I will. Try to get some sleep. * hush little baby don't you cry * * sister's gonna sing you a lullaby * * and when that lullaby is done * * sister's gonna sing you another one * She will have to accept this, that's all there is to it. Here, sweetie. What's this ? Something to help you relax. You're gonna leave me, aren't you ? Sweetheart... I love you. Nothing's ever gonna change that. Even if I were to move in with Jack, you would still live here in this house, and I would come and visit you every day. The only difference is that I would have a husband. This is an opportunity, bea, for both of US, for you to have your own life and for me to be with a man who really loves me. You'll see. Everything's gonna be okay. Now, bottom's up. Good girl. Hey, look at you, you're doing fine. I can do this, as long as you stay close. Think you can get rid of me that easily ? Where did you put it, Rebecca ? Where is it ? This is terrific, Rebecca, I'm having a great time. So am I. So tell me... Do you have a boyfriend ? Uh... no. I guess I just never met the right guy. I take care of my sister, bedelia. You don't talk about her much. What's she like ? * hush little baby it'll be all right * * mama's gonna shoot US a bat tonight * when dad died, mom started to drink. She missed him so much. When she passed away, bedelia and I moved in with our uncle Ernest. Sounds like you two are pretty close. She's the most important thing in the world to me. I mean, she can be a pain sometimes. Little sisters, you know. Right. Bit of a handful. So I worked my way through school, and I've taken care of her ever since our uncle died. Anyway, I guess that's why I never had much time for... for a relationship ? Yeah, that's been my problem my whole life, never enough time. I know that now. But it's all too late. No, Jack. It's never too late. What ? The light. Rebecca, it's happening again, it's happening. God, I can almost see your face, you're beautiful. No, no, no, no, no, come back. It's gone. It's all right. It's okay, that's what's supposed to happen. You're seeing more clearly. That's great. Hey, do you see that down there ? What ? Happy birthday... To a terrific guy. There wasn't a wide selection at the braille card shop. Thank you. Here. What is this ? Open it. You're going way beyond the call here. No, it's not a big deal. It's just something I thought you could use. This is a watch, how am I gonna use this ? It's a very special watch. Listen. It's 2:58 P.M. I love it, thank you. So... This is your precious bat ! Oh, my god. Who's there ? Hey, Jack, why don't you go to hell ! He's made you crazy, Rebecca. No, bedelia, put it down. What is going on ? Shut up ! Stay back, Jack. No, you come and get it, Jack. Come and get it ! Bedelia, I swear to god. That hurts. Let go. Rebecca. I hate you, bat. I hate you, you're ruining everything ! Enough, enough. Rebecca, explain this to me, please. I don't understand what is going on. I have to leave, Jack. My sister, she's not well. I'm going to take her home and take care of her. But I'll be back. Don't worry. It's all gonna be okay. Do you trust me ? Of course I do. Go. I did it for you, Rebecca ! Come on. I did it for US. Be quiet right now. Right now. Come on. Come, come ! For your own good, Rebecca. Just trying to help you the way you helped me with uncle Ernie. You are ruining my life. This has got to stop, bedelia. You're staying put for a while, Rebecca. You've been a very bad sister. Bedelia. First, you kill that Amy person. Then you almost let me die. What am I gonna do with you ? Yes, residential please. I need an address and a phone number for Rebecca Rose. You might as well stop fidgeting, Rebecca. I wrapped you real good. It hurts, bea, untie me, please. Hello. Rebecca, it's Jack. Jack who ? Listen to me, I wanna talk to Rebecca, put her on. My sister is temporarily indisposed. Oh, and she said for you to go away. Did you hear me, bedelia, I want you to put her on right now. Otherwise... otherwise what, Mr. Bat, huh ? You're gonna force me to let you talk to her ? That's all you dirty bats do, force, force, force ! Now, get it through your thick skull... she never wants to talk to you again. * never never never got it ? That was him. He didn't take it very well. The subscriber you called is out of range. Please leave a message. Harry, it's Jack. Listen, something damn strange has happened here with Rebecca. I was hoping that you could come pick me up, take me over to her house. I guess I'll just catch a cab, I'll talk to you later, 'bye. Bedelia, I know you're upset, but unless you start to behave right now... what ? You'll hate me ? I'm sorry that I said that, I could never hate you. Haven't you always been able to depend on me ? Haven't you always trusted me, I'm your sister. Yeah, my dirty, horny sister. Yes, I need a cab right away to 12436 elm drive, please hurry. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. From the angle of the blade, I'd say say it sliced right through his heart. Probably died instantly. Better than he deserved. Tony. Bring the evidence over here. How long you think he's been dead ? From the look of things, few days. Here's the culprit, kitchen knife. What is it, Harry ? I don't know yet. I gotta talk to Jack. Really, Rebecca, hero worship at your age ? Bea, listen to me, I never meant to hurt you. You're the most important thing in the world to me. Oh, yeah ? I'm not gonna let Jack come between US. I just got carried away. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll end it. I'll do that for you. Sure you will. 'Bye, bat, been nice, but I don't love you anymore. You think I'm stupid ? You think I believe you ? I promise you. Fibber. You love him so much, you'd say anything and do anything. I just wanted to make a life for myself, that's all. Can't you understand that ? I understand everything, sis. Allow me, sir. Thank you, I need to go to 901 Crescent. That's the west valley. Sit back and relax, it's a bit of a drive. I guess I'll just catch a cab. All right, I'll talk to you later, 'bye. God, this gets weirder all the time. I need the address for Rebecca Rose. What are you gonna do with me ? I'm gonna keep you here until I take care of something. What do you mean, "take care of something" ? I'm gonna make Jack go away. For your own good. Bedelia, if you hurt him... Golly, saves me another cab fare. Who is it ? Need a hand to the door ? No, I'm okay, thanks. Bedelia. Bat hunt. Rebecca. She doesn't wanna see you, Jack. Don't you get it ? Why didn't you just stay away ? Where's Rebecca ? She's tied up at the moment. Bedelia, I just wanna make sure that she's all right, that's all. You changed her. You turned her into a monster. And you're gonna have to pay for that. You made her wanna leave me. Me for you, Jack ? That's not true. Bedelia, that's not true. Oh, boy, you really are blind. Rebecca's better at doing these kind of things. She knows how to make people go away. Stupid bat. Makes sense, bats like the night. * oh say can you see * when the bat bites the dust * * what so proudly we hail * I know where you are, bat boy. Eee, eee ! Come out, bat, come out. I don't wanna go in there. You're making this very hard, bat. Looks like you found uncle Ernie, huh, Jack ? He was bad, old Ernie. Rebecca had to make him go away, too. Oh, my god. Are you all right ? Go help Jack. All right, I will. We buried him back here 'cause after all, he was family. Still love her Jack ? Still wanna take her away from me ? You have to stay here now with uncle Ernie, because when you're gone, everything will go back to normal. Bedelia, no ! Rebecca ? Let go ! Let go ! Rebecca, oh, no. Rebecca, Rebecca ? It's all your fault, it's all your fault. Drop it. Drop it, or I'll shoot. Bedelia, listen to me. Put the gun down. It doesn't have to end this way. Hurts. Rebecca, it hurts bad. I know, sleep. Just sleep, bedelia. Good night. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Jack ? Hey, Jack, you okay ? Kiss me good-bye. Tell me that i'm... Tell me that I'm beautiful. You are beautiful. * hush little sister don't you cry * * I'll always love you until we die * * and when we die we both will sing * * as we fly together on an angel's wing *
