BELGRADE, SPRING 2000 Doc, where does this blood come from? -Her head. What happened to her? - Load her and be quiet! Come on, wake up! Move! Took a shower, slipped and hit her head on the sink. Eighty years old and having a shower! You don't have to hurry, she doesn't have a chance. Come on, take her head. Let's go! You heard me, dumbo?! Doc, she doesn't have much of a chance, does she, dumbo? No, grannies didn't have much of a chance, anyway. Doc, the granny's bleeding. - I know she is. Her skull is split-open. If you are 80 why taking a shower? You take a shower, dumbo? Say, Tom, will you be taking showers when you're eighty? I've got to get out of this job, I can't work any more... just drive off... get out of here, disappear, man... just sail away... I wish everything would disappear in a big ?ood, and everyone would drown, and me, sail away in this wreck, I'd take nothing with me. Maybe a radio... OK. That's what I like. I'd take a radio to search for a frequency before I go to sleep, that always makes me sleepy. Maybe an alarm clock, so I'd not be late in the morning. And that's all. Shall we go? You know... I'm really in a bad mood... very bad... get it? Please, Kerley, don't... Go on, undress. Hey, ifs even worse when you start like that... Kerley, please, don't, you know how it hurts? I know. It hurts me, too, when you are like this... just take it easy, calm down, don't fight me... don't try to get away... you know it annoys me... you'll be calm, right? Why don't you go back work for your uncle? I can't. Ls there anything else? Why, did he stiff you? - Not for dough... He snitched me to the military police, that's how they got me. If someone shipped me to count 'tomahawks', I'd fuck his fucking mother! Why did he do that, man? I don't know. But I know I spent two months watching the sky and waiting for a bomb to hit me... OK, man, you are alive. Take'Pampers', for instance and go to Hungary and take as much as you can, you'll sell it all. Don't give up now. I'd like not to have to worry, just come here, have a job waiting, and go to work, just that. There's no other way, Nikola, you've got to do a bit of smuggling, cheating... y'know? Either borrow the money and come, or go to your uncle's. I can't go to my uncle's... There's no other way. You've got work, to survive... I'll have to practice breathing deeply... inhale, then exhale... relax my muscles... loosen up... relax my mind... I've got to read ads... I've got to find some kind of a job, I can't do this. I can't settle down here... I can't relax. Would'ya give someone a blowjob for 3000 Deutsche marks? To whom? - Why that amount? For that kind of dough, 100 blowjobs, man. Who messed you up? Your boyfriend? And who to do a blowjob? OK, nobody, I need the dough. I wanna get married. You don't look like you fell. You look like your boyfriend beat the shit out of you. - Listen, I know how I look. I know it doesn't look like I fell, let's leave it that way? I'd tear this wall down, from the ?oor to the ceiling and open a window. Why? - To have a view. So, it wasn't your boyfriend? - No. I think so, too. It's more interesting when you look at the street while you're sitting. If you needed a view, you'd be sitting at a mountain or sea. You need a window, man, to see who passes by. I know them all, everyone passing by, y'know them too. There's no reason to tear down a wall... That's why nobody comes in here and knows what it looks like. There are some places that simply have no luck. You have no luck, 'cause you don't have a window. I had a window broken... my windshield... a missile fell and wrecked the house... I drove like a madman, just to be there in time, and we get there, but no use... No, there's no way out, wherever you turn, you come up against a wall. From all the sides. Wherever you turn, it's solid. I drive like a madman, to give them a chance, but there's no chance for them and for me, either. Let's not be deceived. They sure know how to make those Windshields... it can't fall apart into your face... it can crack up... if it bothers you, you push it out... Come outside so we can talk. No. I want to stay here. Come out to talk, to get things straight. I don't wanna get out, I wanna stay. Let me go. Let's not argue. Come outside. Leave me alone, please, I don't wanna go outside. You wanna go outside? I wanna explain something to you. Listen, I don't want to get involved and I'm not really interested in your love life, but... don't solve your love affairs or any others at my place. That ain't nice. This is a nice place. And I don't like any problems here. I understand everything, arguments and the rest, but if you go on this way, no one will come here. And that means that you're ruining my business And that ain't nice. Now, go on home, when you pull yourself together, come by all means. Feel free to come. You two... come by around closing time, there are some crates to be carried... You can earn a few bucks. - Don't worry, we'll be there. This punk, Kerley, hasn't got a clue about the manners has no respect... not much of the brains, either... looks at me as if I were a street sign, silent... it wasn't like that before, people used to have manners, you can't play it rowdy at somebody ease?s place, there's no respect... that's why my place is empty, because these kids haven't got a clue... about anything. They don't have a life, don't understand a single thing. It's got nothing to do with her being an actress, it's something else, she's the perfect woman. Perfect woman... How do you know that? It's clear, you look at her, listen and it all fits together. Cut the crap, what fits together can come apart. You're a barman, the one who wipes off the counter, empties ashtrays, serves the customers and talk to them. She's an actress, man. It's so far that you can't even imagine. It's got nothing to do with your profession. My uncle is a butcher, my aunt speaks Spanish and Italian. He makes steaks and sausages, she speaks two foreign languages... they live a normal life... Why doesn't she do something? That's got nothing to do with Steva? How is he about to win over his actress? He can write poems or letters. What poems, you're out of your mind, damn it. I do write her poems, that's no big deal... Stop the bullshit, let me see. - No way, man. I can't believe what jerks you are. Poems?! It has to be something enormous, something that'll make her speechless, you get it? What are you talking about, what enormous thing? Buy her a chandelier. Something enormous to make her speechless? The letter? You'd look like a nutcase right off. He should buy her the biggest box of chocolates, and three hundred roses, you get it? Not three hundred roses just like that, but... like it's nothing to him. - What are you talking about? You've got to buy something useful, that can be used. Take her out to dinner or a drink. You've got to approach her completely normally. I went up to her normally? Where did you go up to her? - In the theater bar. Really. I waited for the performance to end then I went inside, she was sitting with some actors, Dragan Nikolic was there, Petar Kralj, Gorica Popover... there were some younger actors... unknown... And then I got in, everybody noticed me; and she of course. Stop the shitting! - And then I turned out gallant. I paid everybody a drink. And then I cheer Dragan Nikolic, Prle and... Excuse me, do you have a few minutes to talk? What's on your mind? And the actress, I blew her mind... Listen, I saw you once, you were walking down Makedonska Street, you had a cool leather jacket, that one, and you were wearing your hair pulled back in a knot. You look great with a knot, I mean it. I haven't seen you act, but I will. I saw you on TV, in a talk show, you were great. Really you were, I was listening. I don't know if you'd like to, maybe, have a drink. We can have a drink or I can go to the bar if you want... I don't really have time now I'm here with some friends, we're supposed to go to dinner. It wouldn't take long. Just one drink, it would mean a lot to me... And it would refresh you, get a load off your mind... I really have no time now. But I've got nothing against... that the two of us have a drink some other time. OK? OK, fine, another time, then. Bye. Y'know, I saw it in her eyes that she wanted to. But she already had plans with some friends, so I left. Everybody said good-bye to me. What's Dragan Nikolic like in private, when you have a drink with him? A nice guy, cool, doesn't show off... talked to me like I was his best friend. What does he drink? - Whiskey. Why'd you buy him a drink? Why not, I paid a round for everyone. Why would you do that. People have their drinks. Why don't you have your drink, pay for it and drink it? Why do you have to pay for actors' drinks? When I get my motorcycle I don't care what kind of chick tries to hitch a ride, I won't take her. I bought my bike, I'm gonna ride it. She can go buy her own bike. Why don't you ride it? I can't register it. I've got to pay 5 grand for the taxes. You know when I'll pay? Never! No way! Duya, have you got the five grand? No, I have three... but I'm not a sucker, I'll give nothing! But, that's a dumb logic you're using. You could die tomorrow without taking a spin. You know when I'll die? Never! No way I'll die for them. I'll take care. I'll wait. I want to ride it legally. I want to have all the papers, and ride it properly. Three years in Canada as a plumber! I earned the money and bought it with it. And they want another five grand! No way! I'm gonna ride it like other normal people. Man, I'd never give every cent for a motorcycle after three years of working my tail oh' in Canada. Now you've got nothing. - Yes, I do. I'll wait, my time will come... I have it all planned out. I'll get on it and head south. I'll take the highway, Skopje, Thessalonica, Halkidiki. Then the ferry to Crete. And on Crete... I'll burn the rubber there. Y'know what ifs like when you sit and start the engine? You lift it up on the back wheel... and take some fifty meters then you slowly press the accelerator more and more... and in ten seconds you get up to 150, man. You can hardly see. Your eyes are full of tears. You wanna have some air, but no way. And it lasts, and it lasts... I'm gonna work. I've got to find a job. You're diving Nikola home? - Yeah. I'm going with you. Because of Kerley? Sure, he'll kill me if I go home now. Let's go. Here we are! What about the two of you earning some serious dough? A hundred marks each? - What do we have to carry? Nothing needs to be carried. You'll steal a bike... it's an easy job, no danger... When? When I tell you. Fuck them all... if I sat down, and calculated how many times I've been fucked... If I could give them some kind of points, and for each fuck... for each mistake to have a point, then I'd get a total of how much I fucked myself, and how much the others fucked me... the fact that I didn't go onto college or learn a trade, that's where others fucked me... but I had something to do with that, too... as for the war, that's the worst to calculate. First, I thought that the others were to blame, my uncle, for example, but now I'm not so sure... my uncle was to blame, but I also fucked up... concerning that... the fact that I can't find a job. The others are to blame, I've got nothing to do with it... or ifs all together one big fuck-up, one big... no, but I'm here now... and this is a fuck... and I'm drunk... ass-drunk... I've got some dolphins, fish, and a beach umbrella. I guess, I may go to the coast... Kerley mistreats me, if I went home now, he'd kill me. Then, when he calms down, he's completely normal, cool, then we get along just great... He ain't that bad, he can be good, he's strong as an ox, when we are out, no one dares approach me. I feel perfectly safe next to him, and he's got money, he takes care of that... of the clothes, food, of everything... The other day he brought my Rastko a toy. You know what... It ain't mistreatment... I don't know, really... Why are you like this... It hurts a bit and then it passes... It ain't like in jail, where they force you... you've gotta do it for me... He can offer me everything I really need to feel good, he takes me out to dinners, I can buy whatever clothes I want, and I can plan a normal life, and that's why I fell in love with him I like how he looks, the fact that he isn't weak, that he takes care of everything by himself, that's the kind of man I need, YOU get it? A sure guy... and I can pick up my kid from my mom's... so he can be a real dad to him, they get along, it'll just take a little time... I don't see anything in your cup. You've only got an animal, like a deer or something, or maybe not a deer, but a kind of animal with horns... How can he live in this room... it's so empty... not even curtains or rugs... he must feel awfully cramped in here, I'd feel cramped in here, I'd be afraid to sleep in a room like this... I have to have lots of things in a room, it's warmer like that, and to have a big bed. I suppose Kerley will want to buy a big bed... I'll talk him into it, he wants everything when I talk him into it. I can get whatever I want... I know he loves me... I could never live like this, like Tom... Tom, my son, why don't you ever call? I cooked some stuffed peppers for you. You just have to buy bread. You have to eat soupy food. Auntie, I'll drop by later, I've just gotten up. You have to come and... don't avoid your aunt, and don't avoid cooked food. The dry food you eat will give you ulcers and hemorrhoids... Do you have piles? - No. You might get them. Your intestines might get knotted. When will you come down? Before I go to work, I'll drop by your place, OK? Fine, great. You can eat at my place, too. We haven't seen each other for some time. I've got something to tell you. I've got some sort of growth under my arm here... I'm scared. Auntie, I'll see you a bit later downstairs. Where is it? Is this for me? Where did you get this? I bought it so you can shine when we go out at night... I bargained with the guy for two hours, first he's selling, then he ain't, I stuck the money in his hand, he thought it over and over... As soon as I saw it in the window I went right in, and said I had to buy that necklace in the window. I and he said: It's not for sale I told him: 'Please, I have to buy it. I'm not getting out! I have a contract to rent this property... Way to go, old man... You're no wimp... someone else would've shit in his pants, I respect that. Who is not a coward? My Dacha? Shut up! They can do nothing to us, we have a contract! Y'see, the man is a character... Just let Dacha go, he's a little bit tired. Hold on, lady, don't move... You can do nothing to me! It ain't worth much... but ifs pretty. It's a heirloom, from my late mother... So, it ain't yours? - Not mine, my mother's. I want all this cleared out by tomorrow... and painted. Clean as a hospital... Understood? Maybe I can open a pizza hut here? Pizza hut? Never! What a day for a ride, man... No one around... I sure would like to take a spin... If I had money I'd head straight for Greece, the roads are good there, dry, empty and sunny... it's warm there... I wouldn't have to wear a jacket, the only thing I'd have to wear is a helmet, because of the flies. It's hot there so there must be a lot of flies... I'd have to wear a helmet... so I'd not get a mouthful of flies. Hi, uncle. You weren't killed? - No. Why did you go there in the first place. I don't know, uncle. Have you brought me anything? What? - An airplane, a missile...? I haven't. So, ... why'd you snitch me to the military police? Let's not argue... You sent me to war to get killed, you fool. You're in one piece. You are an idiot! 'You've got to do, what you've got to do... There's nothing to think about, when you have to... And, no criminal is going to order me... to leave my place never... never... Yes, ifs over your face. You have a job for me? No. And you for me? I don't. Listen to this, this is my favourite. I had a fish when I was a kid... I got it for my birthday... Tom, I'm glad you came, as if you are his dad. It's so nice, gold... Orange... Tom, I've had enough... I've had enough, you understand? I can't be with Kerley any more. He doesn't understand me. I'm not after dinners, outings, money... And the fact that he's good- looking, when he ain't inside, in his soul... you know... a good man. I thought, maybe you and the kid can come on weekends to my place, for a change... I'd put him in the van, drive around, turn the siren on, the kids love that stuff... Sure, great. We'll come for sure... it's like this now, I must keep him at my mother's but... I'm really waiting to fix my life so he can live with me... The three of us could go to picnics, eat sandwiches and cakes... like a normal family, your place could get fixed... some little things we'd buy... I can make pancakes with jam. Y'know what I was thinking? We could organize some kind of a recreation. Recreation?... Yeah, we could play a bit of a soccer, in the schoolyard. Not me, I'm too old. I can't run. You could be a goalkeeper? - Me a goalkeeper? I've held center forward all my life. Where exactly was that? Y'know, when I played, down in the yard, as a kid, I was the attacker, I scored goals, you know why? I hit with my head stronger than the foot, I love the guys who don't play 'cause they're too lazy, but they used to play, and had a feel for it, and had it all, but are lazy now. I'm not lazy, I can't run any more, I could break a leg, I'm just old. I don't like playing in the schoolyard, I could, actually, with small goals, but I can't play with goals that are in the yard... Why not? - Because the goalposts are square. And they aren't goalposts. Goalposts are rounded... Why the hell should it matter? It does, when the goalpost is round the ball brushes the goalpost and goes in. With these square posts, the ball just bounces off anywhere I don't like that, I like it when the ball brushes the goalpost and goes in... it's called an English goal... Hi. These are for you. What are you doing? Doing the make-up? Getting ready for the rehearsal? How much time do you have? Ten more minutes. Go on, you'd better hurry. Thank you for the flowers. They're pretty. I was thinking about a drink downstairs in the bar, and then about going to the dinner to a Mexican Rizzo 'Amigo', have you ever been there? I've got a buddy, Tosha, he's the maitre d' there, he does a bit of waiting, but he's mostly the maitre d'... here's the menu, unbelievable, you must try it. There are some Mexican crabs, breaded cactus... Have you tried Mexican food? You should, I adore it. I really like Mexican food. I read some books about Mexico and about their food... There's one region called Chiapas, only the Indians live there, they can make pasties out of everything, all kinds of plants and animals, they live a completely normal life, making pasties of everything they have, normal people... If you want, I can take you there after the rehearsal. I've got to hurry now. Come to the bar after the rehearsal, we'll talk about it? OK. I'll be waiting. What do you say? What's it like? What's the jeep like? - Nice. So, nice to wet your pants. Kerley, you ain't normal. You are crazy. L gotta go... Thanks for coming... What are you doing here alone? Rehearsing. I have to step in the play as a substitute. I'm so afraid. It's a difficult role. Hey, will you help me? Of course. Tell me how? Come up here... I was afraid that you hated me. Each night I dream how you are looking at me, and you can't recognize me... it's nice in here... Do you hear the wind? There is a place in Turgenev, 'Blessed is he who night like this spends at home, who has his warm corner. I am a seagull I am so tired. I should be killed. Actors, man... such phoneys... Maybe she thinks I'm a shuck... Who cares... Maybe she doesn't think that, maybe she's just putting me on... sure, she's putting me on, she's an actress, that's her job, who cares... I'm happy for her, let her do her job, let her put people on, that's far out, just so she doesn't think I'm a shuck, I wouldn't like her to think that... I'm not a shuck... all of this is normal, everything I did and said... Give me a 'Vodka'... What brings you the biggest profit? I don't make any profit, everything I earn I spend on bills, taxes and the stuff. Then, why do you work? Why do you sit here all day long? Where else should I sit? You could sit at home, or do something else? I can't do anything else. This is the cheapest place for me to be, I don't spend a thing, you spend dough here, I can sit and wait for something to turn up, I can cheat someone here, if I sit at home I can't cheat.. Why'd you have to cheat anyone? Why shouldn't I cheat someone? I get cheated, you get cheated, that's how things work. If you wanna have it good, you've got to cheat someone. That's your story... - That ain't my story. That is your story, you put it together so I get fucked. For me to have it good, I have to fuck someone else? Who says that's right, who says I'll have it good then? Is that the way to function? I don't even have to function, fuck it... No reason to get upset! That's the way the story goes. That's what you have to do, that's what I've learned. Where'd you learn that? I learned... What do you care where I learned it? My old man taught me, and my brother, too. For years and in detail. He was strict and knew that story, you first have to suffer... Why shouldn't I beat them? Why shouldn't I beat them? Beat it! Help yourselves, don't get upset, I'm glad you came. Why, who dares puncture someone's ball, right 'Blindy'? Do they call you 'Blindy' in school? You should let me know if someone touches you. Get down... you hear me!? Don't make me skin you alive! Like a carp... Did your old man work? He was a cop. One day my brother Trifkey and I, he's two years older, we agreed to explain something to our dad. He didn't have to teach us anything any more. We went up to him while he was having lunch... Papa! I don't get it, what did your old man teach you? He didn't teach me a thing I figured it out myself, my brother and I figured it out, that in order to have it good, you have to fuck someone, so I only had it good when I fucked my old man. I got it from my father, that was his school. That ain't school, that's normal... I saw that on TV, on 'Survival', a programme about animals... It was about wild boars, the same thing, about two little brothers. What are you trying to say here? I can't remember exactly... I think one of the wild boars got lost somewhere, and the pack tried to find it, and the lions showed up. Lions chased that pack, they started to run, but the two brothers' father was already old, the kids ran by him, I saw it myself. And then I saw one of those two trip his father... Damn you if you're normal... You saw when the wild boar tripped his father? I saw it, man, it was right there, And the pack ran away, the lions had their lunch, everything was fine. That's normal. It ain't about wild boars, either you stomp or you're stomped on... So, that's why you stomp on us, huh? I just want to be paid by those who owe me. You stomp on others, so that you don't get stomped on. Right, Baney? - Yeah. You got a problem with that? I just wanted to make sure. And if you don't stop looking at me like that, I'll break your.. Why don't you, old man... Why don't you try? Don't be like this, it's nobody's fault. And everybody's... it's all the same, whichever way you look at it. It's important to survive, to settle down. As for who fucked you, and if you fucked yourself... Don't think about it... You can lose your mind. None of it matters, not the goal, the reason, the blame... None of it... You just hide, and watch some strange things go on... You watch how easy it is to bite the dust... how everything gets fucked... the village... the cow, the forest, the mutt, it's all so stupid, man... it's only ten kilometers from Belgrade, but it might be as well as Saigon, and there's no place to take a crap, see, it's dangerous even to shit 'cause of the cluster bombs, the wind carries them like the seeds, get it? Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... seventeen, eighteen, nineteen... Oh, bro, it's like on a 'Fanta' TV commercial... You know what is Ronaldo for Maradona? My ass!- You are my ass, Ronaldo is God, if Maradona was playing now he could only fetch balls for Ronaldo... When he ain't on drugs... You're stupid... You can't understand it, he is on drugs 'cause he is a genius... If I had that kind of money, I would be on drugs, too... I would get stoned, and then go to Kop kabana... Lay in the shade, the drink... the straw, and in front of you, hop, hop, hop... What the fuck's the matter with you?... What hop, hop? Chicks playing beach-volley, you redneck... And then Rio, carnival, samba, rumba, tea-tea-tea. Ma, you've got to keep an eye on his nose, so he doesn't get an infection, you know. That might spread all the way to his brain... The doctor said to take care of his head an weenie, That's the most important. He said he's healthy and developing well... and good-looking, takes after his mother, get it, after me. I mean, I'm not in a position to spend much time with him right now, and... But, when the situation calms down a bit, and I settle down, then everything will be fine. What's important is that he has a home, see? He likes it here fine... I mean, he eats well and plays with toys... and I come, bring what he needs... presents... Who the hell are you? - A buddy, to keep us guard. No way, beat it. -He's OK. I said, beat it. Do the two of you know where Duya lives? Which Duya? The guy who is in my cafe? No, we don't... You know Rasha's junkyard? - Yeah. It's on the same street... well, ifs... the third house on the opposite side of the street... the yard is there and the bike is there. Steal it, and put it in my storeroom. Everything's safe. I'll be with Duya in the cafe? You're gonna swipe your buddy's bike? What did he say? You trust me, don't you? OK, ifs the third house on the left. The very one. Come on. Bye. Vodka and mineral water. - Mixed together? - Yeah. How can you drink Vodka and mineral water together? The bubbles get you in a good mood... I don't need that. I'm in a great mood. Baney, can I just be a customer here tonight, just sit and have a drink? - Sure. Whatsit you have? Tequila, salt and lemon. Cut the crap, you know we don't have that, no one drinks lemon and tequila... Here's some salt, I've got that... grape brandy... Fuck the salt, give me some brandy... What happened with the actress? She's a great girl. Give me one more. She had a tiring rehearsal. Did you pay a round of drinks for the actors again? No, I didn't. Did you talk to the actress? Of course, we talked. And not only that. You watched the rehearsal? I acted with her on the rehearsal. You're lying. - Really! - Bullshit! To help the girl... She has to step in this performance, you don't understand that, you rednecks... I think she's getting hooked, but you know what it means, you have to go slowly. She is a real fine girl, decent The only problem is money. If I had the money I'd take her away somewhere, see... Somewhere far away and we'd be alone, then she'd get used to me... How much do you have? Not a cent. If I had any, I'd give it to you right away... You've got three grand. - That's different. Sell your bike, you can't ride it anyway, and you can't put together the money to ride it... I'm not gonna sell my bike, damn it, I'm gonna ride it... Duya, lend me the three grand, I'll pay you back real soon... You can't get the papers in a month... That's out of the question. Leave him alone. Keep the money, someone might fix you the papers. You should lend him the money... The guy's in love... He's got a chance, Give him the money... and cut the crap. It would mean a lot to me. I can't, man. Try to understand. It's all I've got. This is the third house... This is it. Where's the bike? It must be in the garage. Move, and quiet! Oh, shit... I tore my jeans. Don't worry, you can get a new pair. Give me the flashlight? I didn't bring it, you said you would. How could I bring it when you've got it? Here, I've got a lighter? What should I do with a lighter? Light it if we can't see well enough. That ain't professional, how many times do I have to explain it to you? Where's the bike? We fucked something up... I'll just pick her up one day... Know where I'll take her? To Mexico... Chicks get off on Mexico and South America. I need exactly three grand to buy two tickets to Mexico. Chicks get off on Indians, and I know all about them. The Sioux, Chechens, Wigwams and Squaws, and Firewater, and the Great Manitou... and Sitting Bull... 'Know what his last word were, on his deathbed? The Bull's words... 'No more. G 7 No more And he said it in English... G 5 No more... No more MINORS SHOT IN THE ROBBERY Hi. Where is Kerley? Kerley? At home, watching TV. Listen, I know that he loves me, the fact that he's a bit difficult, doesn't matter He loves me, and I love him, too. Man, I love him. He'll get over that craziness sooner or later. Then it will be a normal life, you see? I can dedicate myself to it. We might even have children. He wants it, too, but needs some time to get used to it. We'll have great time together. Listen, I've got a kid... mother... obligations... I can't live from one day to the next... I have to have security, money, You see? I'm not free, you see? Don't you get it? I love you. You've got to get it into your head, you understand? I love you. I like you, man. You mean so much to me, and when I think of you, I only think about that fact, the fact that you are the only woman I can love, then I wrote some poems about that fact. I don't know if you read them I've sent them to you. But it makes no difference, I wrote poems about that fact. I had to. 'The sky is blue, the sea is deep, the winter is cold. Morning is pretty, you are the prettiest. See... that poem is about that fact, I can do everything because of that, and I can even do some things that aren't important. You see, it's not a problem for me. Don't do that, please. That's stupid. You burst into my dressing room, everything you say to me, all of it is stupid. I don't even know you. - It makes no difference. It makes no difference. We've got to get packed to put together all our money and go to Mexico. Two tickets cost 3000 Deutsche marks... Here it is...

It makes no difference that we don't know each other. What Mexico, man? I have no idea who you are. You are insane. Where are going? Hold on... we've got to get packed. I'm here to give you the facts. To take you to Mexico. I'll have a good time, and you'll have a good time, There's nothing better than that. I'm offering marriage, all you have to do is get packed. Get packed to go where? I'm not going to pack. I'm not going anywhere. There's nothing between us. Let me go. Don't be scared. There's nothing to be scared of, if you don't want to go to Mexico, you don't want to be with me... No problem... I said what I had to, this is your decision. You can go. I appreciate that... And it is very nice of you... But, I'm an actress. Understand? I have to act.
