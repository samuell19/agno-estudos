- The main functions of science can be termed as primarily comprehension and control. The comprehension is sometimes merely that of the physical, but more often it deals with a universal force that affects the lives of each one of us. We know that the vast spaces surrounding our planet are teeming with micro-meteors and radiation that originate from the stars and the distant galaxies. Strange, little-understood phenomena have been observed in the depths of our oceans and deep within the mass that underlies the crust of this globe upon which we live. With the help of instruments and the accepted natural mathematical laws, we have been able to expand our comprehension but to a small degree. Man has learned that life is everywhere, and although we are part of it, it seems the thing we understand the least. The great mysteries we seek to unlock could be no more manifest than within our own being. Actually our quest for comprehension is perhaps most complicated by the failure to discover reality within ourselves. If we're unable to see the woods because of the threes, if we fail first truly to comprehend, then it follows that there can be no chance for any type of control. (suspenseful music) Today we are groping out into space, preparing to invade the incomprehensible universe which has held its many secrets since the beginning. The beginning? We're not at all sure that that term or any other can actually relate to transitions such as gases solidifying to form a planet which would eventually support living inhabitants. What we view as the beginning or the end of something is clouded by the limitations of the mind machine itself. Now if that mind machine had the power to conceive properly of the additional dimension of time, our measurements of it would cease. Man would see the Earth, the stars, the whole cosmic void as timeless. Limitless. When deeper comprehension is brought about by evolutionary processes, man's limitations in space will thus vanish. You will easily be able to travel from one planet to another, from one galaxy to another. The stream of knowledge evolution produces will become a powerful force, one easily able to conquer time itself and the immeasurable distances of space. (eerie music) - [Narrator] Diane Wilson, average American girl living in a suburban community. She had never been known to be mentally ill or behave in the erratic manner in which the police patrol found her. Chief of Police Arnold Johnson had been accustomed to dealing with the many and varied situations that often called for extensive professional assistance. In this case he called upon the best qualified man he knew. Dr. Ian Sabiri, MD and specialist in psychiatry. The doctor had known Miss Wilson throughout most of her years, and was very much disturbed upon hearing of her present condition. It was agreed he would leave at once for an attempt to determine the cause of her unorthodox and very sudden seizure. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Clerk] Miss Wilson, this is the desk clerk. I was told to call if you received a wire from your uncle in Zurich. - That's right. - [Clerk] The telegram just came in, Miss Wilson. It reads "glad you arrived Langsford okay. "Come Zurich to see your favorite uncle "as soon as you can." - Thank you. Goodbye. (light music) - [Narrator] Some miles to the north, another skier was rapidly covering the distance between the frozen wasteland and the nearest spot of civilization, only this excursion was not for pleasure. A mission of desperate urgency was the driving force. The native Laplanders had witnessed something evil in the sky. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) Reaching the desolate communications shack, the messenger hurried to reach the telegraph operator and tell him of what had been seen in the North. A story that was relayed to the city and ultimately the entire world. (typing) In Zurich, Dr. Frederick Wilson, Diane's uncle and world-famous geologist, was summoned from his laboratory to report immediately to a quickly formed group of outstanding personnel presently available to expedite requests by the Air Force command of the local area. The second man called was Dr. Erik Engstrom, also a geologist, and noted throughout Europe as an outstanding leader in the past work of dangerous glacier penetrations. The plan was to investigate the area of the Lap village under controlled conditions 24 hours a day by a team composed of both scientific and military personnel. Doctors Engstrom and Wilson had not previously had occasion to work together, but had for years mutually respected the contributions provided by both. Three would be expected to locate fragments of the meteor, which due to reports of heavy avalanches was assumed to have fallen in the vicinity of the Lap village of Canoerly. A plane was scheduled to take them immediately to Langsford, which would represent their point of embarkation. (airplane engine roaring) - Lucky for us you were in Switzerland, Doctor. - Well, I think I'm the lucky one, Erik. You know I've been chasing these things for 30 years. The thrill of analyzing a fragment from another planet gets more interesting each time. I've been watching those boats down there, what are they? - Ore boats from the Canoerly mine. - You think that the magnetic attraction of the mines could have any bearing on the meteor falling there? - Come on, Doctor. - Who said it had to be a meteor? (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) - Are you the group from the Royal Academy? - That's right. - Colonel Bottiger's been assigned to your party. He and the others are interrogating some Laps. - How soon can we see the colonel? - He asked me to take you directly to the flight office. I have a staff car standing by, sir. - Thank you. (speaking foreign language) - Never has the village lost a larger head of reindeer. He says they ran off as chased by the devil. He is sure something of great size caused the avalanche. - At this time of year, every snow pack in the area is probably cracked. The slightest vibration can start an avalanche. - They know that, but they are convinced this one has some connection with the meteor. - Ask him if he actually witnessed the meteor. (speaking foreign language) - He says it passed right over his village. - How large was it? (speaking foreign language) - He says the object came with a great roar, a fireball as large as a mountain. - Well how accurate would you say his estimate of size is? - He's one of their elders, I'm sure he is trustworthy. - Colonel, the the plane is ready on the lake with all the photographic equipment on board, sir. We can take off anytime. - Very good, Sergeant. I thought we would attempt to locate the site before landing at Rick's Jarvey. We leave as soon as you change your clothes. - Fine. If we can get some good pictures it'll eliminate a lot of guesswork. (suspenseful music) (light music) (applauding) - We'll leave your bags in the lobby and come back here as soon as the pictures have developed. - Fine. I hope you and the Sergeant can join us for dinner. - We'll be glad to. - I think our young geologist has made a discovery. - Yeah. Wait till he finds out his discovery is my niece, Diane. - Now there's championship form, with our without skates. (applauding) - Scientific observation, no doubt. - Hello darling! - She knows me! - That so? - Isn't that funny? Usually I never forget a pretty face. - Or a pair of pretty legs. (laughs) - Scientific observation, no doubt. - Mhmm. - I better hurry, Doctor, if I want to get some skiing before dinner. - Right. Well. - Uncle Fred, gee I'm glad to see you. - Surprised, are you? - As a matter of fact, no. After what's been happening up here, I've been half expecting you. - Oh. - I'm glad too. - He? - Come on, Uncle Fred. - Oh, he. Well, his name is Erik. Erik Engstrom. - What was he doing with you, and why didn't you introduce me? - Wait a minute now, hold it. One, he's a geologist in my party, and two, I didn't want to see my favorite niece get hurt. - Oh, dangerous, huh? - Not dangerous, deadly. You can believe your old uncle, that lad has left a string of broken hearts all over Europe. - Well, maybe an American could (mumbling). Is he coming back? - He said something about going skiing. - See you. - Hey! Remember, I warned you. (light music) (speaking foreign language) - That better be an apology, Mr. Erik Engstrom. - You do know me, don't you? - Huh, know you? Your reputation's the talk of the United States. - It is? - Certainly. They're even thinking of passing a law against you. (chuckles) - Tell me, are all American girls as crazy as you? - Worse. Some of us even like wolves. - Perhaps you'll give this wolf the pleasure of walking back with me. - That'll take longer than skiing. - Exactly. - Well, if you insist. - Hey! (comical music) (light music) - I better have my key. - Certainly sir. - Would you please hurry? We're all waiting dinner for you. - She is crazy. - Sir? - That girl. Who is she? - Why, that's Diane Wilson, the Olympic star. - Huh? - Her uncle, Dr. Wilson, is in your party, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. (playing xylophone) - Too bad you're so tired, Erik. Diane's missing out on a lot of lovely music. - Oh, I see, I should ask her to dance. - Don't force yourself. - Oh no. It's an honor. (jazz music) (singing in foreign language) - What's it called, Erik? - The Midnight Sun. It's based on an old Swedish melody. - About love? - Because I love you, I am alone. No one is there, no one to share, the midnight sun. My arms, waiting patiently, for you to come to me. The night will not be lonely for we will be as one. While sharing love, the beauty of the midnight sun. (suspenseful music) Hey, what's going on? - Come on Erik, we'll tell you on the way. - Good, I'll get my coat. - Well you're not coming. Come on, Hendrik. (engine roaring) - Sorry I had to interrupt your dinner, Doctor, but I thought you should see this at once. - Well I'm very glad you did, Captain. How far away are we? - Less than an hour's ride. - Isn't anyone gonna talk to me? - No. At least we promised not to make you walk home. (wind howling) (speaking foreign language) - This way, sir. - Right. Oh no, young lady. You stay right here. (dramatic music) Good heavens. What kind of animals could have done this? - I'm not sure it's any animal that we've ever seen. Look at this bone. Not broken, it's splintered. - You're right. (bird cawing) (eerie music) - Uncle Fred! There. - Well, whatever creature made this has to be at least 20 feet tall. (airplane engine roaring) (suspenseful music) - That's the Lap village that reported the avalanche. - The meteor should be one of those deep valleys. Let's go down and take a closer look. There it is, Doctor. (suspenseful music) - Yep. Just as the report said. Hit it for miles across the valley floor. - Must be an enormous fragment. An object that side should've stopped where it hit. Magnetic attraction certainly couldn't cause that. - Doing any good back there? - Yes sir, I'm taking a whole role on this run, sir. - After this pass we'll head back. Come here early in the morning. - Well, there seems to be nothing here that we didn't see with our naked eye. Area looks exactly the same as it did when we flew over it this afternoon. Not a footprint in sight. - Why should whatever it is leave footprints near the crater? - She's right. There's no real reason to believe in a connection between this ranger business and what's probably a perfectly ordinary meteor. - I have my doubts about that. Reports of the meteor traveling horizontally. Skidmarks, small size of the crater. All this seems to indicate not so much a normal impact as some kind of a... - Landing. - Don't you think we're letting our imaginations run a little wild? We won't really know anything till we get there, will we? - We? - Well aren't I invited? - Oh no, not this trip. You just stay here and look pretty till we come back. - Colonel, how soon can we take off? - [Colonel] I'd like to get underway as soon as it's light. Let's plan on leaving the airstip no later than 6:00. - Okay. (engine sputtering) (light music) - I'll go get my camera equipment. (suspenseful music) (screams) - Good morning. - What a (audio cuts out) thing to do. - Diane! You shouldn't have done this. We don't know what we're liable to find. - That's just why I came. (suspenseful music) - Look at the steam coming off that thing. - Can we get in close? - Surface down there is full of crevices. We better play it safe. There's a level area back there. We'll be gone most of the morning. Keep in touch with air base, will you? - Yes sir. - This is one place we don't want to be stranded. - All right, let's go. - All right, Professor. (wind howling) (mischievous music) - Now, where do you think you're going? - Please, I'm sorry. But now that I'm here, you know I'm an expert skier, I can handle myself as well as any of you. - Well, she's your niece, Doctor. - Well, it's your expedition. - It was my expedition. (light music) - Still cooling off. - Let's go down and take a closer look. (wind howling) - We'll just make a preliminary investigation of it. You mind staying here with Diane? - No. - He doesn't have to babysit. - We'll be right back. - Are you ready, Doctor? - Let's go. (suspenseful music) (eerie music) - Doctor, do you realize what this has to be? - Colonel, no human technology has produced anything like this. - The outer layer must be a shell of some heat-resistant material. - Don't touch it! - Come on, let's get out of here. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - The fool, he'll start an avalanche. (suspenseful music) - Poor man. He must've been buried alive. - Erik, look! (eerie music) - So that's what he was shooting at. - Erik. - Yeah? - That mapped village between here Rick's Jarvey. Could you and Diane ski there before dark? - Yeah, but how about you? - No no, you two could have help back in before we got halfway. - All right. If we're not back by morning though, you better start following our trail. Come on, Diane. - Calling SR332, aircraft SR332, please come in if you read us, over. - Try it again. - SR332, aircraft SR332, please come in if you read us, over. - How long has it been? - Too long, I'm afraid. We haven't heard a thing since Canoerly. The captain said that Dr. Wilson would call us by radio himself when they reached the site of the meteor. - Is it possible they landed the plane, and with the antenna close to the ground, the signals don't carry? - Not very likely. Do you see that, Tony, that's from 3000 to 5000 feet at the lowest point. Now their antenna has sufficient altitude to carry from 300 to 400 miles, perhaps even farther. - The only thing I can think of is they may have landed the plane, perhaps several miles away from the site because of the snow conditions, and they had to carry on by foot. Now, that would account for a considerable delay in their being in a position to contact us. - Is that the only thing you can think of? - Well look, let's not say it's the only thing I can think of. Let's just say that it's the only explanation I want to consider right now. Time comes to paint a darker picture, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll think of something. But right now it's too early to push the tiny button. All right, go on, keep trying. - Calling SR332, aircraft SR332, please come in, we're standing by waiting for your message, over. (suspenseful music) (chuckles) - Are we almost there? - Are you tired? - A little. - We'll stop soon, I promise. (suspenseful music) (wind howling) - Ow, my knee! - Oh. Do you feel a sharp pain? - Ow, yes. - We're standing by, over. - [Man On Radio] Hello there spotter. I'm afraid I haven't been able to pick up anything from Dr. Wilson. I've been monitoring your call ever since you started, and it looks to me like either a crash landing or a possible freak weather condition. And I'm picking up a strange kind of static intermittently all day. I never heard anything like it before. Over. - Hello Canoerly. Can you tell us your precise weather condition right now? Over. - [Man On Radio] It looks as if we may be in for a storm. But this static I've been hearing doesn't sound in any way like the usual storm interference. Over. - Keep listening and give us a shout if there's any change. This is Langsford out. - Do you know offhand how many planes would be available that can fly at low altitude? - I imagine there's five or six. What about that storm? - I'm hoping it doesn't materialize. If it does we'll just have to wait it out. - Here you go, fellas. - Oh boy, thank you. - Anything come in? - Well, only a report from Canoerly they're expecting a storm. - A big one? - He didn't say. - You know, the more I think about it, the more I'm concerned about that static. He said ti wasn't due to the storm in any way, or any way familiar. Maybe it's some kind of a message from Dr. Wilson. - Sounds feasible. If his radio was out, he would probably try to set up some makeshift static transformer. - Hmm. - What do you think? - It's worth following through. Yeah. Get back to Canoerly. Tell him to make a tape of what he's picking up up there, then feed it into his transmitter so that we can read it here. - Right. (wind howling) - I'll go back to the crater and bring our equipment. - Right. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (wind howling) (light music) - [Narrator] The Laps, being forced to migrate south out of fear of avalanches that had been reported still commencing at points near and around them, were taken to groups covering various routes to the village of Canoerly. Fortunately for Dr. Wilson and the remaining airman, these nomads would provide a welcome escort. (eerie music) (suspenseful music) - Langsford, calling Langsford WJ, Canoerly 97 calling Langsford WJ. Come in Langsford. - [Man On Radio] Canoerly 97, this is Langsford reading you. - Langsford WJ, Canoerly 97. Your plane arrived okay. It's on the landing field now. Over. - [Commander] Hello Canoerly, this is Commander Simpson speaking. I have some thing for Dr. Wilson. Is he there with you at present? Over. - Langsford WJ, Dr. Wilson is outside right now, but-- (crashing) (suspenseful music) - [Commander] Canoerly, hello Canoerly? I don't get your transmission. Is anything wrong? - I don't know. (growling) - [Commander] Hello Canoerly, Canoerly 97, come in please. (suspenseful music) - A rescue cabin. There'll be food and supplies inside. - You were right, I had no business coming along. - Oh come on, forget it. We can rest down there. There should be a lantern. Yeah, here it is. (light music) Ah, let me help you. - Oh, I can take these off. You start a fire. - Okay. You might as well get out of those wet things while you're at it. - Into what? - Oh, there's a blanket on the bar. I want to get some hot compresses on that sprain of yours before I leave. - 10 years on skis, and I have to pick a time like this to wrench my knee. Where shall I change? - Don't worry, I'll keep my back turned. If I make it to the Lap village by dawn, they should have me around to Rick's Jarvey by noon. - [Diane] What about Uncle Fred? - Well, I'll send a search party back to the crater. They'll find 'em. - I hope they're all right. Erik. - [Erik] Yeah. - If that object is like one of our satellites, then couldn't the creature be one of their animals? - Don't worry about the creature. What you need now is some hot compresses on that knee. I'll melt some snow. (wind howling) Now, let me see that knee. (light music) - Ow. - Hurt much? - No, not too bad. - Well. This will do it good. Feel better? - Mhmm. Erik. You better get going. - Yeah. I'll be back first thing in the morning. (suspenseful music) - Erik? Erik, is that you? (dramatic music) (gasps) (screams) (suspenseful music) (whimpering) - What happened? What happened?! - The creature, it's out there! - I'm getting you out of here. Sit down! (crashing) (suspenseful music) Diane, is she all right? - Take it easy, lad. You've had a bad night. - Where is Diane? - Wish we knew. We found a trail leading away from the cabin, but lost it when the wind started. - She's still out there? - Erik, the Laps are looking for her. They'll find her. - How did you get here? - A party of Laps arrived about an hour after you and Diane left. - Where are Hendrik and Bottiger? - Well, Bottiger's plane should be landing in a few minutes. - [Erik] And Hendrik? - Erik, Hendrik met with an accident. - What? - He went back to the crater for the equipment. We found his body at the bottom of the trench. - Creatures. - Yeah, where? - Diane saw him at the cabin. He caused the avalanche. (dramatic music) (wind howling) (eerie music) (screams) (chattering) (light music) (dramatic music) (shouting) (barking) (wind howling) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (steady beeping) (suspenseful music) (screams) (screams) (airplane engine roaring) (speaking foreign language) - They have seen the creature. It invaded their campsite. - What about Diane, have they seen her? (speaking foreign language) - The creature was carrying something in his arms. Could have been a woman. - Uh huh. Think you can fly me to the spot where they were camped? - I could try. - Good. (screams) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (dogs barking) Doctor. That thing must've come from the crater. (gun firing) (dogs barking) (gun firing) Your plane, we've got to get it out. (crashing) (exploding) Come on, Doctor! That's Diane's scarf. Let's get out of here. (crashing) (growling) - Colonel, could you organize a Lap party to help us follow him? - I sent a skier down to Rick's Jarvy. - Well I'm not gonna wait. If Diane's still alive, I want to reach her before he does. (chattering) (growls) (shouting) (growls) (screams) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (shouting) - Doctor, Doctor! Doctor, you've got to stop them! - After what he did to their village, how can I? Look at them! - But he's got Diane! - Colonel, see what you can do. (shouts in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (shouting) (eerie music) - Now I wonder if they found out what they wanted to know. Well, let's hope for better luck when we set foot on some other world. - [Narrator] The time involved in the journey from our world back to theirs could only be known by them. If we searched deeply enough into this, perhaps we'd find an omen. Memories are diminished as the passing of time provides a past. It equally brings to us the future, and without a future, there would be no present. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music)
