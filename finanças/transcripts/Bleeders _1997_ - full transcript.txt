[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: In 1652, the King of Holland forbade intermarriage inside aristocratic families when his doctors discovered the anemia, hemophilia, and the other genetic weaknesses his nobleman were building into their bloodlines. But Eva Van Daam was a narcissist, one of the great ones. Unable to make love to herself, she settled on the closest satisfactory substitution-- her own twin brother. When she heard the King's decree, Eva Van Daam packed up her family-- her brother, cousins, nieces, and nephews-- and transplanted them to the New World. She built a great mansion there. With the passage of time, the doors closed to outsiders, and finally, the Van Daam family disappeared entirely from view. [MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): --stay off shore. However, winds have been increasing dramatically all day from Boston northwards. We expect the tail of Hurricane Adam to pass over the Northeast coastal region tomorrow. Residents in the area should expect high winds and rough seas. Tropical storm warnings have been poseted-- Are you sure you're OK? I've been feeling anxious. I'll be fine. -OK. -What's that over there? -Oh, that? That's the County Cemetery. There's big trouble there. YOUNG WOMAN: Really? Are those women? -I reckon. What are they doing? County caught the owner, Byrde Gordon-- that's her there-- using substandard wood in her coffins. Made a big political stink out of it. Forced her to dig them up, took away her contract. Byrde's always trying to cheat somebody out of something. Coffins are gonna be shipped back to the mainland for reburial. Byrde's mad as hell. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] -Help me. -John? John, oh, my god! Give me my bag-- my bag! I need your help! Come here! Hold his head. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Here you go. No! Get the medicine! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! I'm afraid it's gone, lady. It's OK. Shh, shh. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Shh. Shh. Shh. You low-down thieves! Ain't nothing wrong with them coffins. 'Sides, the only ones that need to be concerned are the ones in 'em. I need a doctor quickly! Well, there's a kink-of-a doctor just arrived. Lives on the other side of the island. Uh, hang on. Alice! We need your boat. It's not the easiest way, but it's quicker. Hey! Hey! Hey! Where do you think you're going, girl? Well, these people need the boat. They need help. Well, get your ass back here fast. You've got work to do. -I'm so hungry. -I know. Help me get him up. Careful. Be careful. Wow. Looks like I may get some guests at the hotel. And with any luck, a burial plot too. Thank you. I'll pay you whatever you want. Oh, no that's not necessary. Don't worry about it. Lazy damn kid. Cruising around in a boat. Guys, I don't like it down here. -Prepare the body for burial. -Lie down, Daisy. Play dead. (LAUGHING) Who are you supposed to be? Byrde Gordon? Formaldehyde, please. Ben, you booger! It's all over me. BYRDE: What are you kids doing down there? Uh, uh, nothing, Mrs. Gordon. Uh-oh, we're in big trouble now. [BARKING] Go on, get out of here. Wait. Someone? [GASP] [SCREAM] Let me out! Help me! Alice, something was after me. There's nothing there. OK. -Something was gonna get me. -Shh. OK. Come on. Alice, something was down there. So much better. You're doing a good job. Come on. Come on. Come on. OK. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Dr. Marlowe! Hold on. Dr. Marlowe? Hello? OK, can you come with me? Hello? Come on. Over here. Over here. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Here, lay on the table. Lay down. OK. OK. OK. Who are you? I'm Kathleen Strauss. Are you Dr. Marlowe? (CLEARS THROAT) Used to be. Not anymore. -Sorry. I don't understand. I was told that Dr. Marlowe lived here. I am Dr. Marlowe. What's with him? He's got blood poisoning. And I need to BAL-- dimercaptopropanol. Do you have that? -Propanol? I need a shot of it, or he'll die. Well, let's just relax. There you go. Are you sure he's not allergic? No, I'm a nurse, and we've treated him with it before. It's all right. It could kill him. It won't kill him. He's starting to seize. Come on! I'll do it. I'll do it. OK. -What are these? Shhh. Shh. He'll sleep for awhile. Let's hope he wakes up. OK. What can you tell me about the disease? It's a degenerative congenital blood disease. That's-- that's all we know. Don't know anything more about it. You're from Paris. He was raised in Paris, yeah, on an anonymous trust fund. It took a lot of digging, but, um-- but we traced the fund back to the bank in Bangor. And this birth certificate, it says he was born here on the island. Strauss-- it doesn't ring a bell. We thought maybe he might have some relatives that lived on the island that knew about the disease or had dealt with it or tried to treat it. Well, it's not impossible. I'd say, good luck. Sign. You know, for a doctor, you're really not very helpful. Who says I'm a good doctor? What about the doctor that signed the birth certificate-- Dr. Asa Peterson? Do you know where I can find him? He drowned on a fishing trip. Look, I've only been here for two months. I can't help you. So you're just filling in here? Yeah, just filling in. I used to have a clinic in Africa-- Johannesburg. Small and simple. (SIGH) I even had my own plane. I didn't know the bosses wanted me out. So one day after I landed a bit rough, they took away my license. Said I had a drinking problem. I wasn't drinking then. OK, ladies, just set it down over here. Jesus. Who'd break into this coffin? What the hell happened to the body? Ah! [GRUNTING] Ah! Mrs. Shea! Hey! Mrs.Shea! Mrs. Shea? Mrs. Shea? Sh. Mrs. Shea. Hang on. Barbara! Barbara, quick, go call Dr. Marlowe right now. Mrs. Shea, don't worry, honey. Hang on. Hang on. (WHISPERING) Help's coming. It's on its way. John? How do you feel? What was that? Oh, the island sometimes has to settle itself. You'll get used to it. Nothing to worry about. Look who'd coming back from the dead. Good. So which color do you prefer? [LAUGHING] How much do we owe you, Dr. Marlowe? That's all right. It's on the house. Thanks. Do you have a place to stay? No, actually, um, can you recommend a place? I'll, uh, drop you off. OK. Come on. It's cold. How old were you when you moved to Paris? I don't know. I was a baby. Oh, that's too bad. It's odd everything seems so familiar. The hotel is right there. It's the only one there is. -OK. Thank you. I don't think I'm gonna like it here. We won't be here long. Oh, they have our bags. John? What is it? Hello. Good to see you looking so much better. Mother figured you'd be staying, so she had your luggage brought over. What is that smell? Oh. Sorry. Uh, we're preparing the mortuary for Reverend Shea's widow. We heard. Hi. Hi. She was a real nice lady. Hey, did you hear about the coffins? Somebody's been breaking into them. Yeah. Aren't there any men on the island? Oh, they're all out with the fishing fleet. Except fro my dad, Hank, because he helps my mother. How about the bridal suite? Thank you. It's strange being here. Well, it's the place where you were born. I know. Makes me anxious. Well, honey, that's completely understandable. How can you not being anxious looking for your family? Stop being so understanding. What are you looking for? Phone book. Maybe the Strausses are listed. There's no phone. Hungry. Well, have a sandwich-- here. Whoa. Whoa. What's the matter? (WHISPERING) I don't know . You keep your filthy eyes off him, Baby Laura. Toot here saw him first. Hi. Could you help us? Do you know if there's anybody named Strauss on the island? My husband's very ill. We're trying to find his family here. He's from the island? The Strauss family? Mm, I don't know anyone named Strauss. I'm John Strauss. I'd really appreciate any help. What's your accent? Is that Italian? Maybe she could help us. Baby Laura? Oh, she doesn't talk. She hasn't she was six. Oh, I'm sorry. It's not your fault, hon. Anyhow, I'm sorry I can help you, but there's no Strauss family here, Let's go. So beautiful. Alice, stop dreaming and get back to work. Those poor people. They have so much trouble. Yeah, well, just make sure they don't leave without paying their bill. Mother, they're not like that. What the hell would you know? People are the same everywhere. I hope not. Well, hop to it. Widow Shea's getting ripe down here. There. That's better. I always really admired your hair, Mrs. Shea. It's always so neat and organized. KATHLEEN: Alice? Are you there? Down here. [COUGHING] I'm sorry. It's embalming fluid. I always smell of it for days after. I was wondering if I could get a ride across to the other side of the cove with you. Um, I'm gonna be here awhile with Mrs. Shea. Do you think you could handle the boat alone? No problem. I grew up on the Vineyard. It was mandatory. The keys are in it. But be careful because the weather changes real fast around here, and there's a storm warning out. -OK. Thank you. Um-- please don't mention this to my mother. -Promise. -OK. Oh, it's coral sunset, so I know it's not your color, but it's-- it's the only one we've got. For Christ sake Alice, quit yakking at the stiffs. It's nuts. Step on it, Hank! You aren't gonna believe this. Hi, Daddy. Hi, sugar. Dorothea tells Hank Mrs. Shea wanted to be buried in her necklace. What neck-- lace? I never saw her wear that before. Shit. Who'd have thought a reverend's widow'd have something like this stashed away. Where the hell she get it? Family heirloom-- must be worth a fortune. Oh, aren't you the observant one. Of course, it's worth a fortune. A fortune that's gonna end up six feet under doing nobody no good. That's what I call waste. And Byrde Gordon don't tolerate waste. Get busy. I want her in the ground before it rains, or bury her at the Van Daam Cemetery. But the Van Daam Cemetery's private property. Well, the Van Daams are dead. So who's gonna stop us? Besides the county's digging up our cemetery, right? And I don't want no more jerk officials nosing around in my coffins. Get back to work. It does seem a shame, don't you think, Daddy? Oh, I don't know, princess. Mother's gonna steal these jewels, isn't she? No, of course she wouldn't do that. Daddy, I couldn't tell this to anyone but you, but I'm going to leave the island. Well, you wouldn't leave your old daddy, would you, Alice? I'd send for you. I couldn't leave your mother. You're just too good, Daddy. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] I knocked. Sorry. No one answered. Oh. How are you? How is John? He's resting. I wondered if I could talk to you? Sure. Sit down, Thanks. I just needed a sounding board, someone just to talk to. Have some tea. Thank you. The level of degeneration of John's blood is increasing, and his seizures are just getting worse. We've been to the best hospitals, and no one has any answers for us. Do you think that what John has is hereditary? What do you know of the Van Daam family? Nothing, why? They came to the island about 300 years ago. They were a rich Dutch family. There's lots of stories about them. I studied Dr. Peterson's files. He was into genetic research. He found some evidence of inbreeding. Inbreeding can cause mutations, genetic changes. One of them, which you may probably know is dissimilar eye coloring, not unlike your husband or like this. Oh, my god. You think John might be a Van Daam? Could be. Well, how can I get in can touch with them? The last of them died 75 years ago. But Dr. Peterson had a nurse. Her name is Lexi Crongold. You may want to talk to her. She still lives here. Thank you. Um, I'm pregnant. Does your husband know? HANK: She was a good neighbor to us. We'll sorely miss her. I remember her as a girl. Ah, ladies, I guess Mrs. Shea's gone to join the old pastor again. May she rest in peace. [SHRIEK] Oh, you scared the life out of me. (LAUGHING) Me too. Uh, I was just coming down to check on some things. Can I get something for you? No, I'm good. Thank you. But thank you very much. Here's the boat keys. Oh, thanks. Have a good night. -Night. Hi. It's just me. Look, I went to Dr. Marlowe's, and he says that he thinks you might be related to the people who first settled on the island. And he gave me the name a woman who knows more information. Her name's Lexi Crongold. We should go see her tomorrow, don't you think? Huh? That's good news, right? Finally we're getting somewhere. (WHISPERING) I'm hungry. For what? Mm, mm, mm. John, no. No. John, no! No. John, no! Not like this. No! (CRYING) Get off me! (CRYING) What the hell's wrong with you? I'm sorry. I was angry. I'm dying. [SCREAM] I'm really sorry, Mrs. Shea. I just need it for me and my dad to get away. [SCREAMING] $2.75? Once again we get the Byrde. ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): --maritime [INAUDIBLE] expect to be rains and winds gusting up to 80 miles per hour. All maritime travel has been given tropical storm warnings. Stay tuned to this station for further updates. Be up here in a couple hours. What's the news from the fishing fleet? Radio's down, and I've been trying morning. Who's there? [SCREAMING] Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Oh, my god. Alice! Alice! You haven't seen Alice this morning, have you? No, actually, we were hoping she could give us a ride to the Crongold place. What the hell for? It's, um-- it's personal. Damn, where's that girl? Well, I've got business out there anyway. I can take you as far as the cliffs in my boat. It's about a half a mile from there. -Thanks. -25 bucks-- take it or leave it. -$25? -We'll take it. That's the Van Daame estate. They were a bunch of Dutch smugglers way back when. Legend has it they used the caves in this place to hide their loot. Nobody ever found any, though. Last of them died in a fire up there in their mansion about 75 years ago. That's where you're going. Up there? Yeah, that's where Lexi lives-- has for years. She was a nurse. Oldens woman on the island. Lord knows what she dies with her self way out there. She's an odd bird, that's for sure. Well, come on. I can take you part of the way. Follow me. There's a shortcut. Subject is male, 33 years old. Blood shows preponderance of acanthocytes indicative of severe hemolysis. It also shows marked similarities to the sample taken from the embryo, suggesting syndrome congenital, possibly inherited. Let's see. Where was I? MAN: Doc! [POUNDING ON DOOR] MAN: Doc! Coming. [POUNDING] -Open up! Hank. Oh, Doc! Doc! I think you better have a look at this. What's that? It's a griffin. This smell, it reminds me of something. (WHISPERING) Alice. Goddammit, Alice! Thought you could beat me to it, did ya? I know you're here. My truck's here, so you're here. [THUMP] [MOANING] What is it, Doc? Appears to be human. Caused of death, severe mutilation. Torso well developed. Testicles fully descended. The damn thing just popped off the pier right into my props, Doc. Wait a minute. Now, superior to the penis in an epidural fold we discover a small fully functional vagina. -You're kidding. -Oh. Seminal fluid present suggests a functioning hermaphrodite capable of having sex with itself. I need a drink. -Make mine a double. Stop! Oh, I-- I've been expecting you. Miss Crongold? You know me? Oh, you're beautiful. Of course, I know you would be a beautiful boy. Come here. Is that really necessary? Yes, it's necessary. Since they burned the estate, there's been all sorts of curiosity-seekers, vandals. I have to protect the place, oh, yeah. That's my job, don't you know. Come on now, boy. Come over here. Ah, yes. Now take off your shirt. Why? Go on. Open it up. I've got to look at that chest. Dr. Marlowe said that you were Dr. Peterson's nurse. Shh! Oh, yes. Yes, very nice. Oh, they're not so bad. Healed real good. But how can you-- Oh, you have every right to know. It's your story. It was the islanders burned down the mansion-- killed off the whole family except for you. Doc Peterson and I had to get you out of here. We had to send you away. Salvaged enough from that fire to set up the trust fund for you. You more than you're telling me. Why am I called Strauss not Van Daam? That's my favorite composer-- Strauss. Now, look here, John-- I saved something for you. See? Look. These were attached to your tiny infant hands. So it was you made them scratches on your chest by clawing at yourself, poor baby. These were attached to my hands? Why? Oh, Van Daams did a lot of strange things. You know-- you know cravings, am I right, boy? Always craving something, but I don't what. Can you explain it? No. If you know about my disease, tell me. No. You-- you better leave now. Tell me what you know. You can help me. No, I can't, boy. I can't. If you know anything about my husband's disease-- No, I told you. Now get the hell aways from here. I can't believe this. Ugh. After puncturing the stomach, pungent odor. Smell it every day. It's embalming fluid, Doc. There's more. It's got three stomachs. Hand me the jar. A live eel. Well, I'll be damned. If he hollers let him go, eeny, meeny, miney mo. My mother said to pick this one. You're it. Ha! Oh, poo, I'm always it. We're playing hide-and-go-seek. Why don't you go hide? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Ready or not, here I come! I'm gonna find you. David? Ben? I'm gonna find you! David? Ben? Come on, guys. Squeakie? Is that you? [SCREAMING] Help me! Ramona! What's happening? Ramona! Ramona! -Hold on! [SCREAMING] -Oh, no! No! No! No, Ramona! Ramona! What are you doing? -I'm going back. -Why, John? They're all dead. There's nothing there for us. It doesn't add up. I thought I told ya's to leave. This is my house. Your house? I'm a Van Daam. There might be something inside to keep me alive. There's nothing in there for you, boy. Then why are you protecting it? (STAMMERING) I told you-- from vandals on account of the fire. Which happened 75 years ago. I'm not 75 years old. You didn't pull me from that fire. Why are you lying? I'm dying. You save-- you saved me as a baby. Why won't you help me now? My boy, go home. If I was born after the fire-- Leave it be. --then all the Van Daams did not die in the fire. Death can be a sweet release. Tell me the truth. I'll show you. I'll show you. Are you kids sure you weren't digging down there? No, honest! They totally caught her! They grabbed her! Are you sure you're not teasing me? There's no time for fooling here. Laura, go take the kids back to town before the storm hits. OK, make sure you keep an eye them. And Squeakie, you behave now. Help Laura, OK? We need help. Let's call the mainland PD. Oh, This house will never burn down. It's made from ships wood, you see-- soaked in brine, permeated with salt. Hey, hmm? There. There. Go on. This way. John. John. The Van Daams still lived here when I was a girl. But nobody ever saw 'em. One day I-- I snuck in here to have a look, and I saw 'em eating. What did you see? It was, uh, the town's folks that flamed the mansion, killing everybody, or thought they did. The truth is some Van Daams escaped into the tunnels below this island. -They're still alive? -Mm-hm. Phone's dead. Phone's dead? Marine radio's down. So we're cut off. [THUNDER] What do you mean they let you save me? Save me from what? From them 'cause you were different. You were normal. I suppose, in a way, they were afraid of you. Still, it was a kindness-- a kindness. -Who is she? -Eva Van Daam. You know what I'm craving, don't you? You have to tell me. I can't. It's a secret-- their great secret. Ah! Over there some light! Open the window! Ah! [INAUDIBLE] Ah. Let's go. [THUNDER] Come on! (WHISPERING) God, this is fascinating. What is it, Doc? It's a red blood cell from the autopsy specimen. It's identical to the blood sample I drew from John Strauss, and the embryo. What's it mean? Trouble. Dr. Marlowe? There's a terrible problem at County Cemetery. Little Ramona got dragged down some strange tunnel. We need all the help we can get. Hank, let's go. Byrde? Ah! -John? Are you OK? You all right? (WHISPERING) Yes. Let's go. OK. John? Come here. The keys are in the ignition. Come on. OK. Can you get the door? OK. OK. OK. All right. [THUNDER] There's a tunnel! Can you see her? I'm going in there? Doc, you better take this. It's all right. It's OK. -Ramona? Ramona? [VOICES] Holy cow. [VOICES] God. Ramona? What's down there, Doc? [THUNDER] What's down there? Doc! Your arm. what happened? Hank? I've got something terrible to tell you. I feel this could be the end. No, it's not, John. Don't talk like that. I think this is it. Uh-oh. Shit. There's Dr. Marlowe's. We have to find a way across. No. Come on! Still down. -Try the phone? -The phones are down. We'll be out of touch till morning for sure. OK so what are we really up against here? There is something. The island is undercut by tunnels, all leading to the cemetery. There are things living in them. They are feeding on corpses. Things? Well, what are they, animals? Mutations-- deformed people, what's left of the Van Daams. They survived the fire. They eat human flesh? Embalmed flesh. By removing the corpses from the island, you've taken away their food supply. Now they're desperate. They're mad. And they're very hungry. They're coming after us. The good news is they're extremely sensitive to light. Let's move to the lighthouss-- everybody. We'll be safe there. [ANXIOUS VOICES] [THUNDER] We need every vehicle in town so we can get folks up to the lighthouse. Come on! Let's go! We need lamps, lanterns, flashlights, flares, you name it. Come on! Let's go. What should I do? Spread the word. We need it all-- flares, flashlights, torches, lanterns. [GRUNTING] I'm gonana get you a shot, OK? -You're on your own. -[INAUDIBLE]. Come with me. Come on. [INAUDIBLE] together. Come on. Don't be scared. John, can you hear me? I know what's wrong with you. I know how you can survive. What is it? How badly do you want to live? It's been soaking in formaldehyde. That's what keeps them alive. I won't leave you. Please don't leave me. Hurry up. Come on. Yes. Yes. We need some more light. Take lights up top. Marlow said to meet him at the lighthouse. John? All right. Look. You [INAUDIBLE] the other side. I'm going around back. What is it? It's as if I had a whole new set of senses. You know when I ate that-- I don't want to talk about it, John. You have to know. No, I don't. Your alive, and that's all that matters to me, so tomorrow we'll go back to Paris and we'll isolate the chemicals that you need. [GASP] [SCREAMING] [CRYING] Get back! Laura? Laura? What is it? What? Toot? Point the light. OK. [INAUDIBLE] more light. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] It's all right. Get inside. Everybody inside! [SCREAMING] We need more lights-- all the lights we've got. [SCREAMING] All right. It's all right. No panic. [SCREAMING] I'll take this-- Calm down. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Good. Shh. [POUNDING] Other side. [SCREAMING] Ben! Let me go! Let me go! Ah! Help! Ah! Hold onto me. We've got to get them. [SCREAMING] Come with me. Up. Up. Grab him. Kathleen! [SOUNDS OF PAIN] Ah! No fucking way! [SCREAMING] (SCREAMING) Help me! No! No! No! No! No. No. [SOBBING] -Get off her. -No! John? Go. I can't leave you here. Please? No, John. [CRYING] Come with me. We'll go home. I am home. [CRYING] I love you. Sh. No! Go. Why? Run! (CRYING) John! [INAUDIBLE] No. No. No. (SOBBING) There's nothing you can do. Kathleen, how are you? -Fine. I'm just-- I'm just tired. That's all. I don't know what to do without John. I don't know what to do. I'm sure you'll do what's best. The baby moved! The baby moved. Come on. NARRATOR: And so it came to pass that John was reunited with the Van Daam family, and he found the he too had a twin. And although his sister could make love to herself, she welcomed her long-lost brother and loved him too.
