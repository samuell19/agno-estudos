We've been in a relationship for six years. Six years. I feel like throwing up. I'm the crazy one. Yeah, she was crazy, so I broke up with her. We were so happy, so we got married right away. Wow, look at you! Congratulations! Our Nara looks gorgeous today! You're so pretty. - When is it our turn? - Seriously! Let's get a picture first. Gone! Nara's gone to get married and I'm... gonna go to hell. Sure. You can go anywhere. Please, just get out of my bar. How could she get married within two months after a blind date? His ex-girlfriend got married today. Apparently he's filthy rich. That asshole Tak-ho. His friend wants to go to hell, and he's gonna stare at his phone all night? Well, he did bet his life on crypto. Even quit his job yesterday. See, I told you to be careful about breaking up! Right? Grown man got cold feet for failing your bar exams! Bro. I did it all for Nara. Stop making excuses, you idiot. That's your insecurity talking. Ma'am, we are ready for you. Gone... Yo. Let's go. To the club, it's on me. - You're a check-n-block, bro. - What's check-n-block? Check your face and blocked. You won't even get in. - Then what do we do? - Buy the whole club. - Buy it? - Let's buy it. I'm going! Where do you wanna keep going?! The wedding. The bride. - Ugh... - To steal the bride. You're too late, dumb-ass. The wedding's over by now! Nara... I can't live without you. - I'll be back. - Hey, hey! - You're too late! - Seriously. - Hey! Dude! - Geez... that dumb brat. Hey, go after him. Whatever. It's raining. Hong... Hong... Hong... Nara... I was just on my way... to steal you... The taxi driver's waiting outside. Go pay him. Oh... Okay. Was he really trying to come get me? Y-Y-Yeah. He wanted to crash the wedding to steal you. - Was just heading out. - Yes, really. What a coincidence. Did you get scared too? Really? Nara. Forgive me. Don't be late next time. Okay. Did I tell you I'm the crazy one? So did your wedding go smoothly? Yeah, I just got here. I'm gonna be okay, right? Of course, stop worrying. Mom is already on our side. I'm not gonna get a face full of water, am I? What are you talking about? My mom is sweet, like a schoolgirl. Like some lady next door. I've never seen a lady like this in my neighborhood. I was curious who made my daughter run away at the altar. Excuse me. In front of all those guests. Humiliating my family like that. I was curious... who he could be. I'm sorry! Drink. You look nervous. Thank you. Let me get straight to the point. Your job? I'm studying for the bar exam. Unemployed. Any money saved up? - Security deposit for my study room... - Enough. I don't need to hear any more. Noh Jung-yeol, you're a smart man. So I'm sure you know what this means. I can't take this money. I beg of you to rethink this. Use this money for your new home. Huh? Put it towards the apartment I've arranged for Nara. Thank you, mother-in-law. Mmm. Unpleasant to my ear, "mother-in-law". Just because I'm allowing it doesn't mean I consider you my son-in-law. I understand. I'll work hard to be accepted as your son-in-law. I'll consider you my son. Just call me "Mom". I have one last question. You're full of twists... You'll have to win over General Hong. Oh, father-in-law... I mean, Dad, right? Die, you bastard! I love Nara! Please allow Hong Nara to marry me! I love her more! I love her more, you filthy fuck! What's your deal? Okay, we get it. Stop. Stop what? I'm not stopping shit! Daddy, stay tough. These idiots put a shit stain on your 40-year military career. You, shut your mouth. You motherfucker! I love Jung-yeol more than you, Dad! Crazy bitch... Get up. Take your mother inside. - I'm gonna kill this dipshit. - Dad, are you crazy?! Dad! You're being crazy! Dad! - Please shoot me! - You asshole! - Just go home! - If you won't approve... - Dad! Dad! - Hey! Don't move, you chump! - Then I'd rather die! - Open your goddamn eyes! - Dad! - Bang! - Release your trigger finger! - Hey! - I'll shoot you! - I'm never giving up! I'll pull the trigger, scumbag! Shoot me! Bang! It's loaded! Just one shot! I'm okay with it! - Nara, I'll be fine! - No, you are not! - Don't move, jackass! - Dad, please! - You don't think I'll shoot you? - Dad, stop it! I'm a three-star general, bitch! - Stop it! - I'll shoot! Dad should've shot him that day. He told me it was a blank. In the end, we got married. Since I blew up one wedding, we had a small one with only family. Is my granddaughter getting remarried? She's not getting remarried, we're just having another ceremony. The groom is different. This guy, that guy, they're all the same. I heard they were rich. Seems like it. Is that a mosquito net on her head? Shush. - That's a mosquito net. - Stop it. Don't shush me. ♫ Congrats ♫ ♫ Only a lil bit ♫ ♫ Don't fight ♫ ♫ Don't get divorced either ♫ ♫ My daddy ♫ ♫ Is a soldier ♫ ♫ You'll die ♫ ♫ You'll get shot ♫ ♫ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♫ ♫ I love you ♫ Alright, here we go. One, two! That really sounds like something out of a movie. It still feels like one. Although the genre turned into a thriller. Ah, almost. You... You just tried to kill me... That's murder. Murder. Attempted murder, dumb-ass. Did you get your lawyer's license from a raffle? So stupid. You freaking... Goddammit... Action! Why are you doing this during work hours?! Sir... You're starting to feel like a man to me. Do you really want unemployment benefits? Choose. Fire me now... Or kiss me. - Cut! - I'm sorry. Cut. Cut. That's a cut. Cut, cut! Sheesh... How many takes do we need? Take 13. I wasn't asking that. These actors can't even kiss properly. That's because you changed the script on the fly. Maybe if you gave them clearer directions. Hey, producer. Are you ignoring me 'cause I'm a rookie? No, it's not like that. Director. Am I really kissing her because I don't wanna give unemployment? That's kinda weird. Why don't you explain it to him? - Explain what? - Your love story. It's well-known in the industry. You know, the kind of romance that you and your husband share. What's so romantic about being with that fool? [Noh Jung-yeol, Lawyer] All our clients keep looking for you. I'm flooded with work. Flooded. Isn't our firm going too far? I need to renegotiate my salary. Ah, I'm so jealous. I want to establish myself and get married too. What do you want? To get married. Just... date. Nevermind, don't date either. You might get married. [Lawyer's License Certificate] [Soju] Hong Nara! Are you kidding me? What is this? Are you crazy? Huh? Is this fridge your alcohol cabinet?! Are you the only one that's busy?! I'm busy too, I work my ass off! You too... I'm sure you know what I mean. What the fuck! He's like a mosquito. I have no clue why they exist, but they keep coming back no matter how many I kill. They say God is fair. And he is fair. He gave me the intelligence and the looks, but he gave me that woman. He said handsome. Hey. If you're handsome, 99% of this country is Timothée Chalamet. Mmm, no idea who that is. He keeps doing this. How am I supposed to live with him? "How am I supposed to live with him?" I told you not to do that! - You always whine, whine, whine, whine. - Stop it. This is a court of law. Your love presented you a movie-like wedding. How did you end up here? Movie-like... You know how it is. Once you hate someone, you can't even stand the sight of them eating. Just wanna plug their nose every time they breathe. Since when did it become like this? When all those hateful feelings started? [Dung-yeol] Since we started preparing for the wedding. Saying the apartment's too big for the two of us, saying a studio is fine. The stinking pride of that man. He insisted he'll handle everything, so he's still paying Mom back. - He reeks of inferiority complex. - Yeah! What a nutjob. "Nutjob" is a bit harsh. He's still Nara's husband. What's wrong, do worse. I'll allow it. Jung-yeol's a fuckhead. That f♫ck. A f♫cking f♫ck of a f♫ckstick. His ID says f♫cktard, that f♫cker. Delightful. I never thought him to be like that. Why not? He always acted so righteous ever since we were dating. The bibimbap he always eats is Korean pride, while my love for pasta is European snobbery. Is he some kind of freedom fighter? Y'all should've been there. He'd mix his bibimbap while saying... Do you know bibimbap? Pulling that kinda bullshit. I think I'm gonna barf. I didn't wanna mention this 'cause it's embarrassing. What is it? The highlight was the honeymoon. So... Just like she begged, we went to Switzerland. Right? We make it to Swiss. Then what are we supposed to do? Go on our honeymoon, no? Sure. Why, you didn't? She wouldn't leave the damn room. Why not? To her, traveling isn't touring. It's for relaxing. Relaxing. She goes all the way to Swiss, and says soaking in the vibes is enough, feels no need to go sightseeing. In freaking Switzerland! Why did we go all the way to Swiss then?! Why?! These are our honeymoon photos. Do these... look like honeymoon photos to you? My mother saw these and said... She thought these were from my father's hiking club. He came to our honeymoon in his father's hiking gear. Who has money for new gear? As a jobless man. Oh, don't start this again. Hold up. Ugh! You're gonna do this again?! Wow! Wow, seriously! - Babe. - Mmm? My classmate has a little sister. She's getting married. Lemme borrow $100, as a cash gift. Why would you take care of a classmate's sister? You're jobless. Haven't you run out of your allowance yet? I don't need it. I'm jobless, where would I spend it? Why are you so late? Is it snowing hard outside? I was studying and didn't realize the buses ended. So I thought about riding a taxi, but I'm jobless. So I walked home. Jobless people don't spend taxi money. What should we do for your mother's birthday? Should we just gift her some cash? You're the one with a salary. Up to you. What do I know? I don't know anything. I'm jobless. Stop that shit! You're insufferable! Jobless! Jobless!! Jobless!!! You're driving me insane! Goddamn lunatic! We shouldn't waste any rice. I'm jobless. She was born with a silver spoon. She lived a plentiful life, she doesn't understand people like us. How can he blame me for that? Is it so hard to accept our differences? Why does he try to force their experiences on me? "Their" experiences? Do you wanna know what I heard the most from my mother-in-law? You've never tried this 'cause... you're born rich, right? Never tried this 'cause you're born rich, huh? Hey! Why are you using so much dish soap? You can wash the entire town's dishes till next year with that. And would you look at that! How can you leave the water running, what's wrong with her?! Mom, stop making things hard for her. Don't say things like that. Dad, I've mentioned it at home too, but habits are hard to break. Whew... expensive habits could be a problem. Is it because she's born rich? Let's see how you guys are living. What the hell is this... Bananas keep longer outside, you can't put this in the fridge and expect to eat it. How frustrating. Look at this chicken. You gotta eat this right away! What will you do with this dry-ass chicken? Boil it so you can finish it, okay? So frustrating. You're buying all these side dishes! It's cheaper to buy them these days, Mother. How is buying cheaper? How in the world can buying be any cheaper? Are you messing with me 'cause I'm uneducated? It must be... 'cause you're born rich, right? Is your family motto "Let's ooze inferiority complex"? What does buying a few side dishes have to do with being born rich? She was just worried for our household. What's so wrong about trying to be frugal? Is that so bad? It's so strange. Why does a man who devotes his life to reducing expenses, dry his privates with a hairdryer? - Hey! - Hmm? Why does that matter right now? Is Jung-yeol still washing? He's trying to be ridiculously clean. Grown man's scared of some spilt wine... You should wash yourself more. You smell. It didn't get on the chair, did it? It's bothering me. Oh geez... Ki-chul, please tell Uncle to hurry up. - Okay. - Okay. Uncle! Auntie's telling you to hurry up. Mom! Uncle's blowing air up his butthole! Ugh, makes me barf just thinking about it. Unbelievable. Your honor. This human... I mean this woman. She doesn't even wash, period. More than you do. I counted every time she washed her hair in a week, but! It was the most futile exercise in human history. Why? Because it never happened once. I wash it at the hair salon because our hairdryer's rotten. I can look past it if she was only dirty. But, whenever she drinks, without ever washing... she asks for the dirty. Hey! Jung-yeol. My baby Jung-yeol is the sexiest when he's studying. I'm studying, so let me study... So I just came from an awards show after-party. And so many people were hitting on me. You know I don't give out my number. But they kept begging me, begging me to take their business cards. [Call Taxi] [Massage] [PC Café] You will never know, how tiring this kind of life can get. I have no clue. What's wrong with your face? What? What about my face? Anxious. You're anxious. Yes, I am anxious. So let's get you to sleep, okay? No, no, no, no, no, no. I can't go to sleep leaving you anxious. You can. You can. I'll make you un-anxious. No thanks... Ew, your mouth smells like ass! Are you okay? I told you, I... As if you're so clean and holy. At least be good at it then. I think I'm better than you. Yeah, yeah, whatever you say. - "Yeah, yeah." - You're sooo amazing. "Sooo amazing." So is that why you cheated on me? - Good morning. - Morning! - Good morning all. - You too. Good morning. I don't like the color of your tie. Sorry? It makes you look old. Oh... does it? You're free for dinner, right? Sure. I mean... Surely not. She's just a junior who has a crush on me. Do I? Why? Just admit you like them young. No need to pretend. I want to pick you a tie. And have dinner together. I can buy dinner. Do you like bibimbap? Feels like a date. If infidelity is the cause, then she'll have the advantage in terms of alimony and property division. Why would something so important be left off the records? Because the one who cheated is actually her. He's the one who shat the bed and got himself fired. Why is he blaming me? Did I fire him? Dumbass director, seriously. You know how directors are. Half are nutjobs, the rest are sleazeballs. So, what kind of director are you? Nutjob? Sleazeball? Me? I'm nuts... for art. I should've knocked his teeth in. Sleazy nutjob. Ah... I think you'd lose. You don't know how to fight. Who hits like that, are you Superman? So fresh, very cool. Hey! Hey! Hey! - Just shut up, okay? - Am I wrong? - You little... - Wanna hit me? Please! We've heard all we needed to hear. Lastly, was there a particular incident that made you first consider divorce? His existence itself is my reason for divorce. I've always had a jinx related to my bar exam. He's a coward, so his stomach gets upset every time. It doesn't just get upset. It's irritable bowel syndrome. It has ruined several of my bar exams. Considering it my last chance, I had just fallen asleep the night before... Well, to be precise, in the early hours of my exam day. Jung-yeol! My baby. Were you sleeping? Oh, cutie. My movie's getting made. I signed the contract! My exam is tomorrow. Oh right. Did you have dinner? I said my exam is in a few hours. Oh right... Shall I order you something? Did you eat? Did you eat... What the hell... Wha...! What is this! What! C'mon! What...! What the fff...! What the... With a severe lack of sleep, along with the fear of irritable bowel syndrome and the pain of hunger looming... I had to take the exam. Well. You did pass. I devoted my entire 20's to studying for the bar. For this woman. But this woman, she only pursues her self-realization by abandoning her household just for her measly... "Measly"?! Measly, that measly moviemaking stuff. I as well, went through hell trying to support this shameful man! I threw away my entire youth! I no longer want to waste my life! So you're both sure that you want this divorce? - Yes. - Yes. What's with the 30-day consideration period? Just kill me when I ask for it. 3,000 days we waited, 3,000. Wow, I actually survived 3,000 days. - What's 30 days more? - Asshole. 30 days. Why, you can't wait 30 days? It's only 30 more! Huh? I'm setting an alert. Stop following me, get lost! Drop me off at my office, I'm in a hurry. Why would I? Hey. Who's making the payments to that car? I am. So what? Get out of my face. Hey. Fine. I'll leave. Hey! You asshole! Stop right there! Back there. You said the first moment you considered divorce was the day of your exam. And? Why did you hold that in till now? You still like me, huh? You're insane. You make me vomit. Asshole. So tell me, I'm asking you. "Tell me, I'm asking you." I told you not to do that. "Told you not to do that." Don't fucking play with me right now. "Don't play with me." Are you mad? I'm sorry then. Stop it. - "Stop it." - Do it one more time! "Do it one more time." I'll do it two more, three more times. Yoouuu... Fuuucking... Assss... Hooole... Where... Am I? Holy crap! Sis! You're awake! Sis! Are you okay? Can you see? Do you recognize me?! Oh my boy! My boy! My Jung-yeol, oh my Jung-yeol! My Jung-yeol! I need to go get your father! Mom! Sister's awake! Keep your eyes open! Keep them open! Jung-yeol's father! Jung-yeol's father! So, how many do you see? Two. Look here. How many do you see? Say three. Three. Shush, seriously. - Four. - You got it, four is right. Yes. Both of them are normal. As a doctor for over 20 years, I've never seen anything like this. It's a miracle, straight out of a medical drama. A miracle, truly. - The car must've been so sturdy, huh? - Yeah. - It's because our boy bought it. - That's right. Look who bought the house... We'll keep our eye on their progress for the next few days. Thank you so much. That's all we need. - Just a few more days to recover. - Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Oh what a handsome fella. Thank you so much. Oh my baby. Met the wrong woman, had to bring you back from the gates of hell. Watch what you say! Look who's struggling because of your bum-like son! "Bum?!" In-law, relax. We didn't say he was a bum. We said he was "bum-like". Watch it. This or that, isn't that the same thing? Stop trying to spin your words. You wanna catch some fists tonight? Huh?! Excuse me. Yes? What is it? I'm sorry as y'all seem busy, but... Who are y'all? What's wrong with him. You got a screw loose? I thought you fixed your accent 'cause you didn't wanna sound like a hick. My child, did you bonk your head too hard? Huh? Hey, is your brain okay? Nara! What's wrong? I don't know, it's just instinct! She ain't right either. It's amnesia, with symptoms of dissociative identity disorder. Amnesia... How do we... Is my son retarded? No, he is not. He won't have any impairment to his everyday behavior, but he did lose memory of himself and the people around him. You know how it is in those soap operas. The protagonist gets in an accident, loses their memory and wanders about, then falls in love only to realize that they were born to a billionaire family, pitting their deathbed-ridden father against the poor lover, stuff like that. Glad they're not long-lost siblings. You must watch a lot of dramas. Yes, I even rewatch the great ones on demand. Imagining that I'm the protagonist. Then how do we treat them? Do they need surgery? Will her memories return? I suppose another car accident or a timely bonk to the head will bring them back. Right, doc? It's possible. Dramas aren't all based on fiction. There was a true case of an American man who recovered after being hit by a baseball. We're married? Married? Yes. They told me you two were married. Oh, hi... Wow, awesome. I married well. What the fuck. Sorry? Huh? Did you just curse at me? I cursed at my past self. Crazy bitch. Seriously, crazy bitch. Wedding picture? We look good together, huh? Hmm? What's this? - Jung-yeol! - Jung-yeol! - Jung-yeol! - Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol, speak to me now. Jung... What the. Oh my gosh! He's bleeding! He's bleeding! See? I told you the rock was too big! I'm your mother, you see? Can you remember me? - You told me you were. - He's not back. Oh no, what do we do... I didn't wanna do it, but your mother kept forcing me to. Want me to call the police? Call what? No need, I'm his mother. We're his parents. Father and mother. Yes. Domestic violence. No worries, doc. I'm alright. No need to call the police. It's nothing like that! - It's just a family tragedy. - Family, we're family. Excuse me. Excuse me. Huh? Do you know what the 15th of next month is supposed to be? If I remembered, I wouldn't be laying here right now. Right. Uh? You fixed your accent. I got hit with a rock and passed out, must've wiped it out of me. There's an alert set for that day, so it must be important. You don't...? Maybe a wedding anniversary or something? Must be your divorce anniversary. What? Y'all are getting divorced. Divorced? We're getting divorced? You know, the court gives you a month to deliberate. To kill each other during that time. You should be relieved for the accident. If not, one of you would've killed the other. No, no way. It's better than both of you dying. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Who in their right mind would tell that to someone who almost died... Why are you speaking down to me? It's been a few days, we're acquainted now. Well, anyways. Live the rest of your lives... repenting. Why? They're free to leave tomorrow. That's great news, I won't need to see her anymore. Please watch over my daughter-in... I mean, this lady's daughter. Take care of her, please. I wish good health for your son as well. Okay. But why are you trying to split up the married couple? I'm just offering my opinion as a doctor. Living in the same environment from before the accident will help greatly in recovering their memories. A new environment will stimulate their brain less, and delay their recovery. Hey, in-law. What? As the doctor suggested, why don't we keep them together until their divorce is final? I don't think so. Our kids can't even remember who they are. Isn't it a parent's duty, to try to help in any way we can? It kills me that they can't even remember their own parents. But what'll we do if they fall in love all over again? If you have any ulterior motives, don't even try me. I can see clearly where my Jung-yeol stands now. I can say the same for you. When the divorce is done, I'm sending Nara to study overseas. That's welcome news. I was worried your daughter might come crying back. Mmm. Sounds like something your son might pull. Never! He's the winner in this. Divorce is but a scratch these days, he'll brush it off and start anew. Then you agree with me on this. Agree on what? To try to recover their memories, but to make sure they get divorced. No way! No way in hell! Am I some servant? Why do I have to watch those idiots?! Because she's your older sister. She's your daughter, you go ahead and do it. I'm not telling you to bathe her. Just stick by her side. Can't we just stick them in an asylum? What if they smear shit on the wall? Hey. I can hear you. Yes, it's a little rude with us sitting right here. Hey lady... I mean, mother. I don't like this either. Do I have to live with this man? He's not my style, and what if he tries to force himself on me? You two are definitely sisters. Both families agreed to this. Just do as you're told. How fortunate that I know the passcode. Is this a home for a human? Oh the smell, it reeks. Is there a dead body somewhere? This can't be a kitchen. Let me take a look. Thank goodness there are no bodies. With the husband drinking this much, no wonder... Mmm, that's all you. How hard did he make my life, causing me to drink this much. Might as well buy a new house. I can feel in these photos... murderous intent. Yup. Sorry. [Wanna watch baseball together next time?] Ah, what the hell is this? Ouch. What do you want? You have to stay vigilant out there. "Vigilant?" Watch over them, so they don't fall back in love. I don't want to! You do it! I can't stay here all day. What about Dad? I don't want to. I can't. I have to start preparing for auditions. Ugh... Are you gonna keep doing that? No, I'm gonna keep doing thiiis! Please, mother. I must've been crazy. Rest up after you finish cleaning. We have an important meeting tomorrow. You two. Don't forget that you're getting divorced. Bye... No. Over here. Not there. Don't you see the dust? No, a little more. No, no, right next to you. Why can't you see it? It's right there. No, the dust is here. Clean this. No, here! Hey! Why aren't you cleaning? I am, with my mouth. Hey! I told you to clean the sofa first. Sheesh... You're back from the dead. Have a drink. Was it you who was hospitalized? What the... Why is the stench of my dad piercing through my pork? Oh. After my shower, I applied a bit of toner. Why do you smell like such an old dude? Didn't it sting? Not my face. How did you live for years with this smell? I mean, I guess you don't even wash. Miss Nara, why did you do that? My hand just did it by itself. Why'd you hit her so hard? Are you alright? What? With the chicken leg, she... I'm used to it. She was being nice on that one. Alright. I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. The only reason you two are here is to remember how horrid your memories were. Every time you see each other, go "ugh!" Uggh! Aaugh! Freak out like that. Okay? Wanna beat her? You already did. Where are you going? Where in the hell are you going? To... To pee. Hurry up. Don't even think about entering my sister's room. Got it. I should get him a pissing pot or something. Really, I'm just going to pee. That's a great idea. The more people that can tell them about their past, the better. Bang. Huh? I think your father really likes me. Miss Nara. Your mother seems to have an extragant side. A bit much. I'll make you remember everything. We will now take the time for all of you to share your memories with Mrs. Hong Nara and Mr. Noh Jung-yeol. Please come sit in the order that we've provided you. Number one! Nara. This is your homeroom teacher from our senior year. Do you remember getting caught smoking in the classroom? Let go of me! I got fired because of you! Don't you remember?! You said your goal in life was... I'm the director! To live alone as a senior citizen. Hello? Pass. - Ki-chul, please. - No! Auntie's waiting. Uncle is there. He's gross. Was I some scumbag child abuser? - I don't like him! - I'm not safe either. - No way, I'm not going! - Hong Ki-chul! Whew, Nara looks fashionable today. She was always pretty. The mystery is why she married this dude. Right, I asked her before they married. Whether idiots are her type. You really don't remember me? Huh? Bro, bro, bro. You remember at your bar, celebrating their 100th day? Nara was so drunk. So cute. I fell in love for this killer smile of yours. Show me more, show me more. - Show me... - Get off me, lil prick. You having fun? Sorry. Why are you leaving? Killer smile... Killer... smile. That's a murderer's smile. You gonna kill somebody? Sir. So we served in the military together? Yup. I was late entering the army, 'cause I'm from overseas. I gave up foreign citizenship for this country. Really? Your citizenship? Where? Foreign. Then you must know how Miss Nara and I met. Of course I do, you ungrateful dick. I'm the one who introduced you to each other. Introduced? Yeah. Before I owned my bar. When I was a businessman in Gangnam. We're leaving, okay? - Huh? - Good luck on your test tomorrow! Okay, I'll see you in class! Study! Study hard! Good luck studying! Got it, thank you. [Businessman] Yeah, what is it? Yeah. Why? You need a lady? Check. Check please. - What? - The check please. Death? Whose death? The check, check, check! Check! Please! Okay I got it, I'm not deaf! Don't worry, what kind of student has any money these days. It's on me. Thanks brother, then I'm off now. Food was great. - Leaving so soon? - I have a test tomorrow. - A test? - Yeah, final exams tomorrow. So you're saying you need a lady quickly! - No, I'm leaving. - Okay, I'm on it! Here, let me help you. You can't woo anyone like this. Okay? No, brother. Stop. I don't need it. Miss. Miss. Seoul National student, Seoul National. Find yourself an intellectual. Move over. Here we go. Have fun, okay? Alcohol. Sorry? - Drinks! - Drinks! Drinks! Okay, one second. You must be pretty frugal. I hear that a lot. You'll be rich one day. Among everyone trying to flaunt, this is much better. Wasn't much of an introduction, if we met at a club. I did introduce you. You said we met for 30 seconds. 30 seconds was plenty. It was the set up to a fateful moment. How many times have I told you not to smile like that? Okay, okay! Go work, brother! Then how am I supposed to smile?! You're so bitter that your smile comes out like that! Just smile sweetly. Or only show your bottom teeth or something like that, okay? There's so many ways to smile. Maybe your eyes can be nicer. Why? - W-Wait! Wait! Wait! - What do we do? - Relax! - What do we do? - Relax! - She can't breathe. I'm gonna squeeze you! I'm gonna squeeze you! What are you doing?! Are you okay? Here, here, sit. Hey. Are you alright? Do you recognize me? Out of the way! I saved her life. Well, a little cliché. But isn't love always so? Love. Like a movie. So that's what brought Miss Nara and I together. No. She dated the ER doctor first. Look at me. How do you feel? I like you. Those two dated for a few months. Sparks flew. They shared a steamy romance. So fierce. One day, she wore just a doctor's coat... Stop. You're not very close to me, are you? Listen till the end. Okay. So a few months go by, but one day... Look over there. She's crazy. [Give her a break. Boyfriend cheated on her.] Eung-gook! Here's the "fuck you" you deserve, asshole! From the club... Here it is, here it is. I'm sorry. Do you recognize me? It's been a while. Jung-yeol. I heard you made the honor roll. At Seoul National University? Wow. That's amazing. You're also planning to go to law school? Wow. Really? Sure. Then I'll soon have a lawyer as a lil bro. Whatever legal troubles we get into, we'll be fine with Jung-yeol by our side. That's right. Noh Jung-yeol the lawyer! [Wanna watch baseball together next time?] Boys like this kind of stuff... Sorry? Unless you wanna meet some auntie at a hiking club, don't do this. Okay. Number. Number. M-Mine? 010... 4428... Four as in foreshadow... Four as in fourth wall... Two as in cut to... I contacted him first? Me? Yes, you crazy bitch. You were blathering on about his killer smile and whatnot. You had the eyes of a lionness who just found food to play with. Right. We should've packed some food and went to stop her that day. Seriously... Where's the soy sauce? I didn't have time to come that day. I was so busy then, remember? Dating that guy. - Full schedule. Back in my prime. - Ask me any and all questions you may have. - Thank you. - Of course. Well, now that I look at him... dressed like this... not bad. You should've called. We could've picked you up at the terminal. No need. Not a problem. I've arranged this today, so just trust me and follow along. You two, keep your minds empty. That way the hypnotism works better, okay? Hypnotism? Trust me. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. You have just lost your memory. Because of a car accident. Yoouuu... Asshole! Who's... the asshole? Me. Why do you think you're an asshole? Nara... hates me... as her husband... Well then, let's visit the moment you felt she hated you the most. Quickly, on three. One, two, three. On the morning of... my bar exam... What the. No! The pot is on fire. And how did that happen? Then what do you see inside the pot? I'm cooking cabbage porridge. Jung-yeol has irritable bowel syndrome. I have to feed him something at least. Today, we recovered pieces of your memory through hypnotic healing. Please tell each other how you felt. Miss Nara, I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't know you were just trying to feed me. I truly am an asshole. Don't say such things about yourself. Mr. Jung-yeol, you're such a sweet and warm-hearted person. Thanks to you, they might have a friendly divorce. Why would they divorce if they were getting along? They'll start to hate each other soon, I'm sure. Jung-yeol, you asshole. Stop it. Okay. Thank you. This doesn't seem right. The attempt itself wasn't bad. [Promising only the best treatment.] The more diverse the stimulation, the more effective it will be. Why are you standing there like that, doc? Why don't you send them to their workplaces? Their workplace? It's their warzones. Their stress from their past might kickstart their recovery. Hello. Oh, gosh... Amnesia. I heard about your accident, but I never thought you'd forget me. I'm sorry for causing you trouble. Not at all. You really can't recognize me? Ah, I'm sorry. That's okay. So how do you plan on completing your work? For the time being... Time to go if you're done cleaning. Oh! Welcome back, sir. Here, let me... You're back early, boss. Over here. Boss. Have a great day. - You have a good one too. - Yep. No rush. As the CEO of our law firm, I believe it'll be tough for you to continue your duties here. It would be best if you resign for health reasons, and return once your memory comes back. Okay. But... Are you the real CEO? So you are real? I'm sorry. Sorry. Can we talk real quick? I'm not religious. Hong Nara! I heard you dropped out of this project. Yeah. So? I've made my decision. Because I'll regret it if I'm too late. Or you can just... keep regretting. It's hard for me to say this to a married woman. Well, you don't have to. I need to clear my name from the rumors. What? You visited my home because we were working on the script, right? All you did was monitor my progress, making sure I was eating and drinking properly. We had nothing sexual going on, right? Ah! Now I understand. No wonder something felt off, I had a strange feeling. It made me anxious that I couldn't remember... But I was just popular is all. Oh sorry. No, thank you. Oh okay. - It was nice meeting you. - Yeah. Let's never meet again. Alright, I'll go knowing that there's no misunderstanding. Good luck on your shoot. Okay, I'm leaving now. No, no, no. ♫ I'll remember you ♫ ♫ Remember... you-u-u-u ♫ I can't understand myself. Why did I want a divorce? You're kinda cute. Sorry? Did you say something? Huh? - What? - Huh? What? I said, you're cu... kinda. W-What? You're cu... a lil bit. What...? What I'm saying is. You're c... alright? ♫ I'll remember the scent of your shampoo ♫ Whoa! Miss Nara. Miss Nara! I... Sister-in-law. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Ahh... I'm just... My head hurts reading up on all these laws. I can imagine. Whoa, what the hell. I remember! Like this. Like this. That's how you fed each other strawberries in bed? Like... Naked. Yes. That's right. Like that. It's just a fragment of your memory, but this is a great sign. It means sexual instinct is stimulating your brain... Why don't you try sleeping together? You mean like... just sleeping, right? No, like sleeping. What's so strange about a married couple doing so? Thanks to your mothers' efforts, we're seeing signs of your recovery. But we're going to need more willpower from the both of you. Miss Nara, are you busy tomorrow? Would you like to watch some baseball? The doctor did ask for more from us. It's definitely not a date so no pressure. No worries if you're busy. [Not busy at all.] You going to an awards show? Where are you going? You don't need to know. Oh, today's trash day. I should take out the trash. Where's the trash? I'm in trouble if I don't. Ah, here's the trash. I thought you're just taking out the trash. Yes. I am. Ah well. Gotta look classy for the neighbors. Isn't that... too much class? This might be overdoing it. What the hell... He's so creepy. Do you remember anything? It does feel familiar... But I can't remember anything. So this is how it feels to lose our memory. We probably didn't hate each other when we were here. What do you think went wrong? I guess some things are better left forgotten. If... our memories don't come back. Maybe, just maybe. Would you... like to start fresh... Oh! Lucky! Oh, wow. Awesome! Hey! I need to get home too. Yes, we're sorry. We're leaving now. Young people these days do whatever they want. Aren't you hungry? Wanna eat something? How about something simple, like pasta? Oh pasta. Pasta, pasta. Pasta isn't bad, but... Do you know bibimbap? We can eat both like this. Seriously. Why didn't I think of this? Cheers. Cheers. You know how in dramas, it suddenly starts to pour. Whoa! Use this. I'll go get it. Oh... Miss Nara. What the hell are you doing? Are you insane? Ouch. Why did you slap me? You're the one who kissed me. No, I never... I did! I'm sorry! Go ahead and slap me too. Why would I? Are you mad? W-W-Why did you slap me? I don't know, I... Suddenly, a nice memory crossed my mind. Well... that's a relief. Here, hold this. Huh? I'll get the other umbrella. Shall we get one more drink? Yeah... I mean... Yes. I didn't slap you on purpose. It kind of hurt, but I'm okay. Whoa. Sorry. - I thought you were making gambas. - Yeah, you were cooking up a storm. I burned it all. The wok is so hard to use. Hey Tak-ho, are you still riding that coin? Go home, dipshit. Get lost. - Go do that at home. - Bro, bro, let him be. He needs alcohol to endure the pain. Wow, it's been years since I saw this group. Oh, Ae-ok is here! Where's Young-ji? She's busy with a fling. A 20-year-old, twenty. Oh, Johnny's hear too. "Johnny?" Why is he Johnny? My English name is Johnny. You better cut it out while I'm still nice to you. Do you know he always texts me late at night? Look. "You asleep?" "You asleep??" "You asleep???" - "Are you asleep?" - Stop drinking so much, you sleazeball. Whatchu gonna do if she's not asleep? To say goodnight. Goodnight my ass. You tryna give her nightmares? Look, look! I told you they walked in with a different energy. Hey. With how things are turning out, just don't get divorced. Well, fine by me... See, look at our hip brother Ki-bae. He almost got divorced twice, but they're still going strong. He's something else. Twice? Divorce turned out to be harder than I thought. With property division, consultations, the consideration period... You guys don't know this. On the 2nd time, we even stamped our papers and went our separate ways. But half a year later, I went for some paperwork And it showed I was still legally married. Hmm? Why? Both my wife and I were so lazy, none of us reported it to the district office. Apparently if you don't report it in 3 months, the divorce is automatically voided. Oh, is that right? It's a hassle going to court again so we're still living together. Isn't breathing a hassle for you too, bro? Lil bastard. It's never a hassle to beat your ass. - Alright, that's enough. - You could kill me with that. "Johnny?" Huh? Wanna sleep? Now that you've made it this far, just stop fighting and make up. Us? - Yeah. - Us? Oh. - How about a love shot? - Love shot? - Love shot is great. - Let's do it. - Ah, we're good. - Let's. Love shot! Love shot! Love shot! Hey! Love shot! There we go! They're doing it! Oh, so sweet! Another love shot and they might have a baby. Ah. I'm so sorry. So sorry. My guy just wouldn't go home. Sorry I'm late. Why are you outside, where's Nara? - She's inside. - Why in my bar of all places... Did y'all drink a lot? How much? We popped nine vodka bottles. Nine? Nine's good, let's open our tenth. Let's go go! Wait, wait, wait. Don't go in yet. - I think it's time to head on home. - Yeah. Why? It's been years since we got together. - No, no! Young-ji! - Young-ji! Go, go! Gosh, what do I do? I'm supposed to be the boss here. Seriously. Why in my bar of all places... Hold up! You frickin... Ugh, why here, in my bar?! Never came home? Yeah. Their phones are off too. Surely they're not together, are they? No clue. But they never came home. They're back! Did you follow the garbage truck all the way to the incinerator?! - What is this. - Hi, Nami. Today I'm... Whoa. Does a bull live in this house? Wow. Feels like a newlywed's home. Nice work. Nice! We were drinking at brother Ki-bae's bar and knocked out altogether. Nobody asked. Where's Sis? Oh, uh. Miss Nara? She's not home? Why is the door open? Oh, Mr. Jung-yeol. Oh, Miss Nara. You must've met your friends too. We spent all night chit-chatting at her place. Ah, sounds like fun. We had a lot to catch up on. Drink up! Drink up! Drink, drink, drink! Alright! One, two, three, go! ♫ What brings you to my home, my home, my home ♫ ♫ I came to bring flowers, flowers, flowers ♫ Yup. They're singing. It feels like a housewarming party. Cutie. Do you remember anything? Nope. Oh. Drop your honorifics. Okay. Why can't we remember... Do you wanna try again? Sorry. That's what I wanted to ask you. Pisses me off the more I think about it. The owner of that small ass club wants to judge me?! What the... What are you doing in my... Sorry. Sorry. Mom! Nara is raping Jung-yeol! No, not Jung-yeol! - Sister is forcing herself on him! - Sister-in-law! Not him, her! Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol! - Jung-yeol! Jung-yeol! - What's wrong? - Oh, Jungyeol! - What's wrong with him?! Oh my gosh! How embarrassing. What the hell did I slip on? So humiliating. Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. I'm alright. Calm down. Geez. Jung-yeol... I mean, brother-in-law. - It's my fault, I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. - Let's visit the hospital. - No, we're really alright. I'm fine. I'm totally fine. Sis-in-law, don't be sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. What you saw earlier, I hope you can gloss it over with your mother. And here, take this. Go buy whatever you want. Okay? Stop it, you're scaring me. Just take it, no need to feel pressured. Here, take it. C'mon. Why won't you take it? When an elder gives you something, you say thank you and take it. C'mon now. It's okay. Do you see someone there? Oh no, he's gone crazy! Oh my god! Sis-in-law, c'mon. Just take it. Take this and go to the mall. Or better yet, the luxury section. And buy yourself one. Or two. Or three... Jung-yeol! Were his eyes always open? - Hey, Jung-yeol! - He opened his eyes! Yo! Noh Jung-yeol! - Are you Jung-yeol or Dung-yeol? - I'm your best friend. - Are you okay? How old are you? - Are you a man or a woman? Tell us. He looks alright. Hey, bring your sister in here. Yeah. - Are you alright? - Jung-yeol. Do you know how much Nara was crying? She stepped outside to calm down. She'll be back soon. Son of a bitch. I cancelled my class and sprinted over here. I'll take liquor as my reward, okay? Are you alright? - Hey. - Speak up. - You okay? - Noh Jung-yeol. I clearly warned you, didn't I? That you and Nara are supposed to get divorced. - I pounced on him... - Shut your mouth. You must not have anywhere to go, so you can stay here until the divorce. I'm also to blame for putting you two in here. You go pack your stuff. It's my problem. Let me handle it. I'm your mother. Unless you want to burn this bridge, do as I say. I've prepared for you to study abroad. Get ready to leave once the divorce is final. Study abroad? So suddenly? It was already decided before your accident. It wasn't supposed to be this soon, was it? You don't have to study. Just go cool your head. Please give me some time. Jung-yeol and I... Don't you dare bring his name up! Even when everyone opposed the wedding, I was always on your side. As long as you were happy, I closed my eyes, blocked my ears, shut my mouth, and accepted it all. You don't remember, but you struggled so much living with him. And it hurt me so much to see you hurting. That's a past I don't even remember. We don't know what the future holds. Nara. You two are already over. What if you start again, but your memories return? What will you do then? Will you stay unhappy all over again? Do you want me to see that again? I can't do it. I refuse to see you in pain. Ever again. Why are you here? Did you leave something? Your memory's back, isn't it? How did you know? I can feel it. Seems like the eyes of someone who hates me. I'm sorry if you felt that way. What are you gonna do? Your mother's right. We're... I'm glad at least you found your memories. They told us to wait 30 days, but... The ruling was so fast. Wasn't it? Have a nice life. If our memories don't come back, do you think we can start fresh? Lucky! I'm glad at least you found your memories. [Hope our memories never come back...] I'm late again... I wanna go to New York too. Just take what you need. We can send you the rest. Ah, I wanna go to New York too. You go ahead and sleep. I'm sleeping with sis tonight. I'm gonna miss her. Yo, Noh Jung-yeol! Hurry, come outside real quick! The owner is here! What? The owner of this house is here! Yes, mother-in-law. What are you doing still here? I'll be out within today. Hurry, please. It makes me unpleasant that you're still here. Yes, I'm sorry. My Nara will be taking the 8:20pm flight from Incheon Airport. But I'm here to tell you this is my house. Understood. Thank you for everything... No need. Just make sure you leave before 8:20pm. You don't have much time. Incheon Airport, Terminal 1. Hey. Why are we eating on the floor? There's a table here. That's not mine either. Mother-in-law bought us that. What time was her flight again? 8:20pm, Incheon Airport. Her enunciation was on point. I think it's time for you to leave... What changes, I can't win her back now. I was just offering you to see her off, but I guess you wanna win her back? Seems like it. It's too late. We stamped the papers already. Did you report it to the district office? No. What the...! I thought you had three months till it's voided. This bastard... had lines too! I'm done with crypto. It's all gone. They gave him lines... Right, your divorce isn't final yet. You still have three months to report it, 90 days. You stupid coward. It's not over yet! Okay? You can turn this around! - Wait! Shhh. - This isn't the time to be slurping noodles... Quiet. This is the climax. What the hell are you talking about. Flashback. Remember the beautiful times you shared with Nara. That's it, reminisce. Get in your feels. Reminisce... Beautiful times... Freaking Dung-yeol! Hey. How many times have I told you? If you can't aim, then sit to pee! I've been saying it all year, haven't I?! Lift the seat, piss, then drop it again! Ew, your mouth smells like ass! C'mon... Good job, DJ. Got em. Oh no. Why is my hand here? Stupid idiot. - Open your eyes! - Please shoot me! Just go home! - Don't you dare move! - Dad! To support this shameful man, I threw away my entire youth! What is this?! What the hell? You know how directors are. - How do you feel? - I like you. Why would you take care of a classmate's sister. You're jobless. You're insufferable! Jobless! Jobless!! Because I'm jobless. Job... Jobless!!! How was it? What was that? Aren't flashbacks supposed to be beautiful? It's fucking infuriating! Oh, uhh... Try not to think post-marriage. Let's try again pre-marriage. Whatever, whatever. I'll think about it on the way. - Alright, let's hurry! - Let's go! Seriously, are you a turtle or what? Forget about the damn brakes, just step on it! Are we on a field trip? Can't you see Jung-yeol's in a hurry? Wow, this bastard. They gave him mad lines. Step on it! We gonna miss the plane! Oh? - Oh? - Yo, yo, step on it! No, the steering wheel, steering wheel! Is this the fastest you can go?! Step on it, there we go! Don't be late next time. Okay. Hurry! Hey, hey, hey! What time is the flight again?! - 8:20pm! - Hurry! Here it is! Hurry! C'mon, hurry! Almost here. Follow me! - No, wait! Wait! - It's almost here! Wait! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! So sorry! - Give that to me! - Oh, I'm so sorry to those people. You're dressed like that? Ah, I feel so sorry to them. See ya. See ya. Take good care of yourself. Nara! Killer timing. Why'd he bring those idiots? So unromantic. Hong Nara! Okay, we're good. That was close. We... watched a movie like this long ago. I'm sorry, Hong Nara. I've always been a little late, haven't I? Even when we first kissed. Even when I almost lost you to another guy. Even going to my bar exam... And even now. I read somewhere, that break ups happen because bad memories start to outweigh the good. I thought that's why we were getting divorced, but I had forgotten how much I loved you, how precious you were to me, because I let the bad memories blind me. Suddenly... I found myself worrying, what if you leave me once your memories return. I don't want to run away as the only one cherishing these memories. All these beautiful moments I remember, I really want... you to have them too. What...? Sorry. You looked so serious, I missed my timing to take them out. I'm sorry, Hong Nara. I've... always been a little late, haven't I? Even when we first kissed... Let's consider it heard. I'm glad to see you smiling again. I'm leaving now. Bye. - No. - Hey... - N-Nara. - You can't just... go. You... You... You should've called her earlier! Don't you have a phone?! You don't?! What are you doing not using your phone?! Is this the Joseon Dynasty? You thought you'd get here just in time to say, "Nara... Please don't go..." And you expected her to come back?! Did you think she would run in for a kiss?! What do we do with him?! Is he stupid?! What an idiot! Let's go. It's kinda awkward. - Let's go. - Wait. - Let's go. - Wait. Stop it. Maybe you should text her. I forgot my phone. Whew, this sucks. No, no, no! Sir, wait! - Sir, wait! - No, no! Slow down! You got taxi fare? That looks dangerous. Noh Jung-yeol. Can you give us a minute? Wanna go look at your phone? Why are you here? Why did you... Why! Did! You! Come! Back?! Oh, sorry. I forgot to report our divorce. You knew. I started to think it was unfair. What about it? You must've divorced me because the bad memories outweighed the good. But I didn't. I only have good memories. That's unfair. You have to wait until my memories come back too. Or, even if they don't come back. Wait out the reporting period. I'll make my decision in three months. No? That's what I was saying earlier. Then... do you wanna kiss? No, why? We have to. Says who? Okay, just a peck. Quick peck. I don't want to. Don't you watch movies? This is when we're supposed to kiss. I haven't watched any. Forget it, I don't want it either. I'm gonna marry him. Approve of us. Huh? General Hong. Relax. When did you two meet? Yesterday. Shoot em both. M-Mother. Mother. I'm sorry, Mother. Babe, run! Look. We hate each other to death when we're together, but miss each other to death when we're apart. Doc, why the hell do our brains work like this? If I knew that, do you think I'd be watching dramas all weekend? Bro, the crypto era is over. It's time for stocks. Everyone is saying no, but this is the perfect buying opportunity. According to the M.o.M. reports, the whole world is buying right now. Lemme tell you again. The crypto era is over. Now is the perfect time. When you're a student, it's natural not to have money. Don't worry. I'm loaded. Drink up. That little fox. [Johnny: You asleep?] Let's start the audition. I wrote this song after being inspired by my sister and her husband.
