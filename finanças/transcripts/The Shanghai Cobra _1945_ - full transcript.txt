I was afraid to talk to you in joe's. We've been followed for days. What I've been trying to tell you is this-- Mr. Black? Mr. Black? What happened? I don't know. He started to say something to me and then he fell down. Try to revive him, please. I'll call a doctor. [crowd chattering] All right, all right. Let's break it up. What's happened here? Where's the girl? Uh-oh, I thought you'd be back for your nickel. Where is she? Where did she go? Oh, you been stood up, pal. She went out the back, fast. Where'd he go? You mean the guy who give me the nickel-- Don't give me that. The fellow killed a man outside and ran in here. Oh, you've been stood up, too, pal. He just breezed through the back, fast. [gunshot] What a day. People run in, nobody eats my beef stew, People run out, nobody pays for their coffee. Hello, babe. Give me a nickel's worth of anything soft and soothing. My head's killing me. (lorraine) joe, who got killed? I don't know, but from the sounds in the alley, A cop's killing my customers. "third cobra killing." [intercom buzzing] Yes? (secretary) mr. Gray. Send him right in. Chief, here's the latest dope on them cobra killings. Uh, washington just got it from scotland yard. There was a man murdered the same way in shanghai in 1937, And a man by the name of van horn was arrested but he escaped. Did they send his description? No, they lost all of his records In the shanghai bombing 8 years ago. There's only one man in the entire country Who can identify this van horn, And I'm afraid we can't get him. Who is he? Charlie chan. Who says I can't get him? George, Please come into my office and take a telegram. (secretary) yes, sir? Will be out of town for several days. Must postpone all business. [traffic humming] Most interesting case. In 4 months, 3 persons are murdered by bite of cobra fangs. Yes. Man named rafferty, and a girl called dunham, And then a man named black. Most curious. All 3 victims work for 6th national bank. Yes, but there's no connection between them, uh, charlie. The men were bank guards and the girl worked in the posting department. 8 years ago in shanghai, china, I arrest a man named jan van horn For bank robbery and murder by cobra bite. It was first day japanese bombers fly over city of shanghai. [bombs whistling] Our prisoner, jan van horn had been injured in bombing, And the inspector was driving me to his office. Van horn badly burned in bombing? Oh, he's pretty badly disfigured on his face and hands. I'm afraid he may be permanently so, Unless he gets immediate plastic surgery. Inspector mainwaring and myself continue on To the british international settlement police headquarters. There I meet jan van horn for the 2nd time. Good morning, mr. Chan. Mr. Corning. Sorry we had to call upon you. Most happy to be of assistance. If you'll sign right here, please. Mr. Hume? May we have your signature on this receipt for the prisoner? We'll turn van horn over to your custody. Let's go. Mr. Chan, I don't care what evidence you've got. I'm being framed, I tell you. Singapore authorities will determine your guilt or innocence. I'm telling you, I'm being railroaded. They'll never let me get to trial. Still a matter for courts to decide. Come along, van horn. You're just like all the rest. But I tell you, I'll even this score with you one day. (chan) special agent hume took van horn to wharf at shanghai, Where they place him aboard ship's launch. He was starting journey to singapore, where he was to stand trial. The launch left the wharf. When launch reach midstream, one of ship's officers went to bow of boat. Van horn ask remaining officer for a light for a cigarette, And when officer reach for a match, Van horn struck him malicious blow on chin And disappear over side of boat. And that was last I hear of jan van horn until now. Could you identify him today? His face badly burned, perhaps greatly changed. But his hair most unusual. Uh, very black with strange streak of white. I see. At any rate, charlie, I want you to know how glad I am The government has let you off to help me. And I want you to feel that you're in full charge. Oh, thank you, thank you. But I am still government agent. Vaults of 6th national bank contain something Very valuable to american government. Oh. What is it? Stores of radium. Radium? That is valuable. Is there much of it? Several million dollars' worth, perhaps. You see, bank is distributing center For hospitals, laboratories and factories In this vicinity. Well, I must be off to bank and afterwards, will visit coffee shop. Want to use a police car? Oh, no, thank you. Uh, With your permission, I will telephone assistants At hotel to meet me with car at the bank. Sure, charlie. Help yourself. Thank you. [people chattering] Birmingham. Doesn't the bank smell nice, huh? Yeah, and that green stuff don't look bad, either. You know what? I bet it would be an easy job to knock off this bank. Wouldn't it? You know what we'd have to do? Is drive our car out front and leave the motor runnin'. Leave the door open, Come in here and take all this money out without firing a shot. That's probably why pop wanted us to meet him here today. Yeah, yeah. You know... Now, like the last-- Hey, what you doing? Wait a minute. Now, if I had a million dollars here-- Now, uh... Hello, pop. Glad to met you, mr. Chan. One moment. One moment.

Mr. Rogers give you address of 1055 harley street. Yes. A rooming house. I was to watch it every night. If the girl, pauline webster, came out, I was to shadow her, But do nothing unless she seemed to be in danger. Did she go back to the harley street address the night black died? Yeah, but by the time I got there, she'd packed and gone. Next day, I got this in the mail. A week's salary from mr. Rogers. Postal money order. Impossible to trace. And this. "payment in full for services to date. Do nothing more about pauline webster." Signed r. Rogers. Man tried to disguise handwriting, But police will learn everything By checking everyone who work at bank. Now are you satisfied I'm in the clear? If we find this girl, your innocence might be established. Perhaps she guilty. Otherwise, she would appear. Oh, no, no. She couldn't. Why not? Well, because she couldn't. She's--she's too nice. She's... Well, she's wonderful. Oh. Inspector, you will please inform newspapers You have arrested ned stewart for murder of samuel black. Arrest me? Why? Wish to learn if strange girl So wonderful as you say. Miss webb, uh, I was wondering If mr. Fletcher had seen these headlines? Thank you, mr. Adams. I'll show the paper to mr. Fletcher. And another thing I don't understand is-- [telephone rings] Pardon me. Inspector davis. Oh. For you, charlie. Me? Excuse, please. Charlie chan speaking. Oh, yes.

Besides, much better for you to have dinner With young detective than with old detective. Good night. Well, I don't know exactly what to say, but thanks. Oh, I know you didn't have anything more to do With mr. Black's death than I did. What did you do that for? Well, now we're even. Well, why? You kissed me, didn't you? Yes, but I did that because I didn't want you to start an argument with mr. Black, And besides, he was beginning to be pretty nasty And I was afraid somebody would make a scene. Well, it certainly was worth it. Wh-what is? Catching up with you. Are you sure you have? Oh, you're not married? No. In love? [sighing] not exactly. You had me pretty scared there for a minute. Why? Well, if you're in love with someone else, You can't very well be in love with me And if I'm in love with you, naturally I-- Just--just--just a minute. What are you trying to say? Well, uh, can't you guess? Oh! [chuckling] oh, no. People don't fall in love that fast, except on the stage. Or do they? Finish in the offices, larkin? No, I have mr. Fletcher's office to do, But he's in there with mr. Harris. They came back after dinner. Davis speaking. Yes, larkin. What'd you see? I can't talk, inspector, I'm being watched. You and mr.

It's the police. Where's larkin? We can't find him, but we found this in mr. Harris's office. [chuckling] well, I haven't even been in my office tonight. Mr. Adams, you bank guard by day, also by night? Uh, double duty today, sir, because I switch over To night duty for the coming month. I can't understand larkin's disappearance, But why are the police looking for him? Because he's a detective. A police detective we put in here 3 months ago. You search entire bank? Thoroughly, sir. Both floors and every room, But somehow larkin managed to get out. I don't understand it because the guards Haven't unlocked the door to let anyone out tonight. But larkin's gone. What's happened to him? Appears to be mystery Which we must solve alone, inspector. Rising generation sit too much. Why you here instead of mailing important letters? I mailed them, pop. But on the way, we got this. You get illegal u-turn ticket? Mr. Chan, I'll tell you just how-- Tommy, you tell it. I warned you, birmingham. I said, "no u-turn here." That's what you said: "no, you turn here." I said, "no u-turn here." That's what I did, "you said no u-turn here!" Pop, I told him. I said, "no u-turn here." That's what you said. "no, you turn here." and I did. You see what I mean? I said, "no u-turn here." Mr. Chan, did you hear? He said-- Please. Please. You turn so many u-turns, You have my head spinning like merry-go-round. You--you remain here until I find doghouse Big enough to hold both of you. Please, please. Oh, mr. Chan, I have something important I'd like to ask you. Do you think, uh, paula will like it? Do not offer ring until case is closed. Hey, now wait a minute. Do you still think paula is connected with these murders? Ancient ancestor once say: "even wise man cannot fathom depth of woman's smile." Any further trace of larkin? (davis) none. My men are making a check Of the entire first floor of the bank building right now. What is below bank? Nothing. Must be service tunnel, sewers. That's right. I never thought of that, charlie. I'll call up the building department And have them send the plans right up. When you receive architect's plan, we take look below bank. And here's another thing, charlie.

Uh, we arrive too late. Taylor, the laundry store. Let's get out of here. (tommy) help! My assistants out of doghouse and in more trouble. (chan) tommy. Birmingham. Pop. Thank goodness. How you get here? Through a laundry, pop. You look wet enough for laundry. We followed those 2 fellows we saw in the pictures this morning. When we got down, they started shooting. After we found a dead man. You find dead man? Where? Down below, in the sewers. Come show me. This way, pop. Quick. Charlie, it is larkin. Now we'll never know what he wanted to tell us. Even in death, mr. Larkin tell us What murderer do not wish police to know. Yes. Yes, thank you, doctor. Mr. Larkin is 4th person to die by fangs of the cobra. At least we had a motive for his murder. He wanted to tell us something. For same reason 3 other people die. Miss paula webb say mr. Black wish to tell something. Therefore, he was killed. Sure, people are always getting in trouble for talking too much, pop. Be sure you remember that. Mr. Larkin's body found on outside of bank, Which prove in reverse there is way of getting into bank Without using doors or windows. Yes, but charlie, the bank plans Show there's only one entrance to the bank. Buildings can be altered without altering plans. What about the maintenance store, pop? Maintenance store not inside of bank. That is outside, in hallway of building. Now, this is bank. Time element prove neither mr. Black, Mr. Rafferty nor miss dunham poisoned inside of bank. Right. Mr. Black's body found there. Rafferty got in the car and died right there. Miss dunham got on the bus And dropped dead right there. There, there and there. Seem logical place where 3 persons poisoned by human cobra? It's the coffee shop. Exactly. Place which need much attention, which we give same tomorrow. But, pop, we found larkin's body down in the sewers. Excellent, excellent, very good. You talk fast. You think fast. Excellent. We go now to laundry with mysterious trapdoor. Come. In here, pop. Pop, the trapdoor's back there. There. Right there. Who are you to come bustin' in here? Police, please. This is the table, pop. We picked it up-- Just like this. What? The trapdoor's gone. Well, don't look at me. I didn't take it. There never was a trapdoor here. I could have told you that. Pop, I want to talk to you as man to man. I am ready, but you still have few years to go. That's right. Well, is that all you gents want? Sorry for intrusion. Forget it. Next time, bring your laundry and I'll call it square. Gee, I'm sorry, pop. I guess we should have our eyes examined. Yeah, mr. Chan, we are mortified. Perhaps you not so dumb as you think. We call police. You want us to watch the laundry, pop? No. Make the occupant suspicious. We learn nothing. [telephone ringing] Hello. Rita? What happened? It worked, jarvis. Yeah, they just left. They couldn't find a thing. Good girl, rita. Now, take it easy, Because they've been completely thrown off the track. You were right but how did you know those 2 kids got in yesterday? The maintenance door. We wired it. Yeah. When it opens, an alarm bell rings down in the tunnels. It didn't ring when those 2 got in, So they must have followed us in through the laundry. Well, we've got work to do. Get these things out. Yeah, that rita's a pretty clever kid. What's the idea of the, uh, rockets now-- Be careful, taylor. You want to blow us to bits? Why are we loadin' these things now? Have you finished those tubes down below the vault? Yeah, they're all set. The boss wants us to get ready to get this radium any night. Maybe tonight. Very clever and unusual. Uh, in-information most interesting. Thank you very much. You're entirely welcome. What did he say, pop? What's up, charlie? Will illustrate. Come with me. (davis) why'd we come here, charlie? My assistants not entirely insane. Huh? "not entirely?" Lawbreakers make first move, so we make 2nd one. Recently has been counter here. Also shelves. My assistants in this room yesterday. Oh, no, pop. We were next door. No. Cannot sell bearskin before shooting bear. Watch the entrance. You not here yesterday? Why, no, pop, we were... Why, yes, we were. Yes, sir, mr. Chan. This is the table right here. It's got to be. See, pop? How did you know this was in here, charlie? Oh, I am very smart detective. I talk with one man who always know what happen in his street: United states letter carrier. He tell me yesterday laundry here. Today, move one door further away. We go down. You two, watch from across street. I see you later. Hurry. Thank you, mr. Chan. Thank you very much. Peculiar arrangement of pipes so close to bank wall. Must study architect's plans to determine purpose of same. Down there is where we found larkin's body. Now, we try to discover how larkin get from inside of bank to here. Someone employed here recently. Look, they work here. Someone has made an opening into the ventilating system. Passageway go upward, but not built far. I'll try it. (ned) I'm making a turn left. There's a light up ahead. Mr. Chan, this seems to open into the bank. Mmm-hmm. I am certain of same. Come, quick. Let us go. Visitors are supposed to be announced. Sorry. Police do not read emily post. Uh, I must offend emily post once more. Your company not desired. This where you came out of the ventilator? Right there. I closed it. This is where mr. Larkin so strangely exit from bank. Oh, this is a surprise. That's what I was going to say. You often work here late at night? No, mr. Fletcher never keeps me after regular hours. Paula, are they questioning you about me? Where'd you come from? I didn't see you come in. You can see us all go out. Miss paula, get your things and come with us. Yeah, yeah, I know you're police, but I ain't done nothin', No matter what my ex-wife says. You own this place? Sure. Is that a crime? Employees of bank come here often? All the time. They are my best customers. Where you obtain music box? Uh, oh, that, I--I got it from a fellow come in one day. I make a big percentage on it. Name of man who put in machine, please. A guy named jan van horn. Jan van horn? Name sound familiar to you, miss webb? I told you, I know no one by that name. Can you describe van horn? Oh, sure. He was a sort of a short, uh, well, not too short. He was a little bit on the heavy, uh, but, uh, but his hair. Oh, he had his hat on. He was just-- j-j-just one of them mediocre guys, like you and me. Oh, thank you so much. Yes, splendid. Uh, you will all remain here, please. We'll see you later. Come.

Your face greatly changed. Plastic surgery. I also dyed my hair. I am jan van horn. Dad. Even humble detective notice affection between you two. Dad never killed anyone or robbed any bank anywhere. Mr. Van horn, after you escape, why you come here? Because one of the men on the boat in which I escaped Had some of the jewels I was accused of stealing in shanghai. Why not inform police? Because he was not the leader. I intended to follow him to get to the man who framed me For robbery and murder. Who was man you follow? Jarvis. Jarvis take offices in bank building, so you get job in bank. Yes. Paula also got a job. She saw black talking to jarvis, So she started following black at night. That's why I hired mr. Stewart to follow her. Only one man ever fully believe you rob bank in shanghai. Man who collect all and only evidence against you. Who was that? Man who disappear when you escape. Special agent hume of shanghai. I have here bag of strange powder Which I find on mr. Jarvis' desk. Mr. Jarvis, you can explain what it is? You should be more careful, sir. Excuse, please. Real explosive in another bag. You are one who stop being careful. For first time, you use left hand. What are you talking about? Special agent hume, killer of shanghai, also left-handed. Are you trying to say that my name is hume? Will prove same when I receive fingerprints from England. All right. You're breaking my arm. Let go. Take them both out. Put them in confinement. At last, inspector davis, we capture the human cobra. 2 buttons, observe: One to open, other for killing detective larkin. I can't tell you how much you've done for me, mr. Chan. Glad to be of service. Perhaps can still be of further service. Some time ago, mr. Stewart purchase this ring In the hope miss paula might wear same With your permission. Excuse, please.
