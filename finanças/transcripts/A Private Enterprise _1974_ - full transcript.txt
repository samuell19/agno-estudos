FOOTSTEPS BIRDSONG DISTANT INDISTINCT CONVERSATION GURU: One might sayit is your own way to find. But once you have entered in the spiritual brotherhood of Manav Dharma, and have partaken... SHE MOUTHS ..if the spiritual wayis truly received, it means it is fromthe will of Param tm . But if it is not yet received, it's from the will ofthe person himself, because the spiritual truth comes essentially from the power of Param tm . Our time is nearly up. Just one more question. I would like to askSwami Jayanti, please, how long must we wait when we have partaken ofspiritual truth before we go out and mix withother people? Swami Jayanticannot lay down rules. Swami Jayanti can only advise. And his advice is this. If, when you mixwith other people, you feel as thoughyou're restrained, then they are the people who have other material thingsin their mind. Their spiritual character, moreover, is deficient. And that must bethe last question. But I think that Swami Jayantihas agreed to do us the honour of leading us in the prayers. We much appreciate this,as his time is very precious. CHANTS: Om shanti shanti shanti ALL REPEAT MANTRA Well? Come on. I want you to meet Swami Jayanti. What for? To get his blessing, of course. Swami Jayanti, I've brought a dear friend to meet you. I hope you'll forgive himfor arriving late. He didn't mean to. Time is maker and breaker of all the things. So little yet so much. Yes. You must have an awful lot of things in common. Where do you come from? Far-moving swami belong everywhere where there exists the spirit of Param tm . Line up on the steps here, will you?
