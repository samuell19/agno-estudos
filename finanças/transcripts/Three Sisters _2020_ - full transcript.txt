You didn't have to bring snacks, you know? I couldn't just come empty-handed. Ms. Jeon! We'll see you at th housewarming. Sure. - Thanks for the snacks. - Ah, yes. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. My husband's a sweet guy, isn't he? Hyo-jeong! - Going back to school? - Yes. Why don't you take my husband's car? Hyo-jeong's heading for school, give her a ride. Okay. The library? - Yes. - Get in. - Good luck with the exam. - Okay. I'll be praying for you, Hyo-jeong. Seung-woo's musical interpretation aptitude... Right. and finger contact's quite sensitive than his peers. - Ah, is it? - Yes. So, though it's totally ok to stick to the cello, I'd... Ma'am, your phone's been ringing for a while. It's ok, I'm listening, go on. But your phone continues to ring. Don't mind me. You should get the call. Uh, it's really okay. Uh, then, if it's ok with you, I'll be quick with this. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Shall we give it a try? Yeah, Mi-ok. What is it? Well. Why aren't you answering your phone? I'm at my kids' music class. I guess I missed your calls cause it was so noisy. What's up? It's no big deal, but Yeah. I suddenly had this burning question. About what? Like what? Remember when you came to Gangneung to see me. and we had sea squirt bibimbap? What, what did we eat? Sea squirt? Yeah, during my first year of university. You came to my dorm after you got the driver's license. Don't you remember? Of course I remember. It was my first visit since you got into university. Why wouldn't I remember? Of course I remember. You were a newbie driver, but drove there to treat me to good food and nearly crashed into the sea and got lost. We finally found a diner in some run-down buildings. I wanted to go inside, but you didn't cause you were scared. Remember? I kind of remember a place like that. Where you could see the sea, right? It was a god awful run-down joint. Right. That's it, right? You had sea squirt bibimbap. I did? You were smiling cause it was so good. Yeah? And I had spicy cold noodles with raw fish. I see. Mi-ok, let me get back to you later... I can't recall the diner's name and it's killing me. Mi-ok, it's no big deal Why should it bother you? That was a long time ago. It's natural to forget. But it's bugging the heck out of me! Why can't I remember? God, I'm such a bonehead. Aw damn... Why does that make you a bonehead? Jeon Mi-ok! Mi-ok! Listen. I'll think about it I... - Yeah, I'll try to... - Don't bother! - I'll try to rememb... - Forget about it! Don't force yourself. No! Wait. It just irritates me more. Mi-ok! Daepohang Diner! That's it, right? It wasn't that kind of name! How I'd love to go there again. Mi-ok, let's go together next time, ok? We can go another time. Right? Mi-ok? - Mom. - I'll call you later, Ma'am. Appreciate your call. What is it, Ha-eun? I'm home! I bought your favorite, spicy chicken feet. - Have you eaten? - Yeah. What you lookin at? Get out. Aren't you hungry? I can tell you haven't eaten anything. What you lookin at? Get out. Huh? I can't help it, you're so pretty. What're you doing? What the heck are you doing?! What the heck, goddam it?! What the heck are you doing?! Go away! What're you doing?! What're you doing?! Ha-eun. Can't say grace again? I know you can do it, Ha-eun. Lord, please give Ha-eun the courage to say grace. - Stop it! - Quiet. But Seung-woo keeps hitting me! I did not?! - I was just nudging you to pray. - Ha Seung-woo. Don't cry, Ha-eun. Is it really difficult for you? But Seung-woo keeps bothering me! But why are you crying? How dare you! How dare you hit me! Why can't you say grace?! - But you don't say it, either! - Quiet. - I do! - One, two, three! Mommy has counted to three! Do you both want to go to your rooms with me?! Mommy will say grace. Lord. Thank you. Not a big fan of him whenever he plays a part. His voice is too small. He needs confidence when he's acting. Awe, scumbag! Gimme $10. You got some change? Just joking. Church and prayers will put your house in order. You understand what I'm saying, right? Yes, Mom. You don't sound well. You need more money? Is your husband asking for more money? Of course not. He's not like that anymore. Mom! I'll see you at dad's birthday. Okay. Talk to you later. Mom, what about Jin-sup? Is Jin-sup okay? Yeah, well. Yeah, of course he's okay. - I'm hanging up. - Okay. You remember our housewarming service today, right? Oh, yeah? What time is it? I've been mentioning it forever. Do you have to be somewhere else? No, not really Here you go. Anything interesting? What are you doing?! It's not like you. You're not supposed to use your mobile at the table, right? - Right. - Right. Ha-eun. Eat up. What? Does it taste better that way? Mind your own business. I... went to the hospital yesterday. What for? Did you catch anything fatal? Jeez... Got something to say? - No. - Where's your father? Did he go to work? Why hasn't he made any soup? Have you eaten? I don't usually eat breakfast. Hey! Get over here. Come here. You're working out to get girls, aren't you? - No. - Are you working out? Hey, say 'good bye' at least. Awe, damn. (HUSBAND: I'M DROPPING BY TODAY) - Anyone there? - Here, welcome. - Hello. - Yes. Can I get a flower basket? Of course, what's it for? - It's my dad's birthday. - Ah, birthday. How much is one like this? I see you have serious cramps. It's not cramps, it's cancer. I'm sorry. What an inappropriate thing to say to a stranger. Uh, this, uh, is... What's your budget? Around $50...ish? Yeah, Mi-ok. I'm trash. Wha...what was that? Mi-ok. I'm a bit busy now. I'll call you when I get home. You need a bag? Sis, I'm a piece of trash. How come you're always so busy when I call? Mi-ok, it's not that. Hey, have you been drinking? Huh? Nope, I'm totally sober I'm a piece of trash. You get what I'm saying? Why would you call yourself a piece of trash? - You want the trash bag one? - Hey, Mi-ok. You know each day, I pray to God for you? You need the trash bag one? Excuse me, can't you see I'm on the phone? What? I'll take it. Whatever. I said, I'll take the trash bag one. Yeah. Huh? Sis. Mi-ok, I wasn't talking to you. Uh, yeah. Soon mommy will...

Honey, I'm a bit busy, - can I call you later? - Everyone's so goddamn busy! Go kill yourself, scumbag! Awe damn! - Hallelujah. - Hello. - Welcome. - Hello, guys. I'm so sorry, Pastor My husband is running late at his school. He's on his way. I'm sorry. It's okay, we can wait. I stepped underneath the cross and unloaded my burdens. Praising the Lord. Well, it's okay. Someone else SOS-ed me for a birthday basket. I can just give it to that customer. Right, right. No, it's fine. Come by next time. (I LOVE YOU DAD HAPPY BIRTHDAY) Here you go. Will Mr. Ha be very late? Pastor, I'm so sorry I feel bad. He texted me that he's almost here. - Everyone must be hungry, right? - No, it's okay. Or why don't we just go ahead and eat? No, no. Even Jesus fasted for 40 days in the desert. He's here. I think he's at the door. Why are you so late? Hurry up! Uh, come in. - Uh, Hyo-jeong. - Hello. - We met at school. - Oh, really? - You're here! - Come in, come in. Hyo-jeong, you're here too! Congratulations, Mr. Ha. Ms. Jeon! Yes? Were you calling for me, Pastor? There's a Jeil Church nearby, isn't there? Yes. Most of the neighbors must be attending services there. - I'm not sure. - Pastor, it's ginger tea, your favorite. Try it, I made it myself. How's the coffee? What's this? It's so pretty. - Is it a gift? - Of course it is. It must be from her boyfriend. - Who is it? - What does he do? - Who is it? - Tell us, now. It's nothing like that. It must be someone we know, right? Of course not! It's nothing like that. What's up? What's so interesting? Hyo-jeong's boyfriend gave her this ring. It's so pretty. It looks quite expensive. Really? You have a boyfriend, Hyo-jeong? No, I bought it off the street. It was pretty and cheap. Come on, show her. - Let me see. - It's just a... What's wrong? Is it something I shouldn't see? No, it's just... Who cares if it's cheap? Let me see. - Wow. It's pretty. - Isn't it? - It looks good on you, - Uh, it's not expensive. Forget that. Frankly speaking, what do they know? How dare those losers touch my work! No, I'll be there in a second. Okay. Hey, have you seen my wallet? Where did it go? Awe, damn, where did I put it?

Who do you think you are? How dare you rewrite my work so easily?! Hey! They're just friends, not our theater people. Get your facts straight before throwing a fit! See you later. - Yeah, see ya. - Sorry guys. I guess we've never met before? What's your husband doing over there? What do you think, damn it? He's waiting for me. Are you satisfied? Marrying a greengrocer like him? He ain't a greengrocer, he's a veggie dealer! How dare you talk about our marriage! Honestly, you don't share the same language or views of life. Didn't you say he voted for the conservative party? There were rumors around the theater scene that you married for his money. Go fool yourself! Hey, what're you doing, with all the lights off? I don't want to run up the electricity bill. And there are so many bills to pay. Hey! Put some makeup on for god's sake! This ain't no woman's face. And you expect customers to come to your flower shop? When the shop owner looks like this? Huh? I do put makeup on. I do put a lot of different stuff on. Shut up. You call that wearing makeup? Honey, stop it. You're drunk. Didn't I tell you to eat a lot when you drink? I'm sorry about this. I did eat a lot. Yeah, yeah, okay. Now put your jacket on. I'm so sorry. We should get going. She's too drunk. Right, see you later. You're not leaving anything behind, are you? I'd appreciate if you could look after her. For what? Why should I look after her? Well, you're a director, so you could give her more chances. - Look. - Yes? Why should I look after her? Why should I do that? What for? - Well... - What do you want from me? Uh, just things. Okay, just go. - I said, go! - Yeah, okay. Hey. Are you still eating goddamn bread at night? Are you? I missed dinner. Come here. Stay still. Hey, what the... What are you gonna do about this, tell me? Planning to take a slice out to cook soup? Meat soup? I am slimming down Ouch, that hurts. Slim down, my ass. Jeez. I'm not kidding. Hey, Hee-sook. How about living a little more decently, okay? Here. That's why the lights are off. Things are so tight these days. Honey, get under the blanket. Okay? Raise your butt. Yeah. What a tough day it's been for you. Sleep. I'm going to work. - Honey - Yeah? Are you in a rush? No, not really. Let's get laid Yeah, why not? - Let's do it. - Yeah, sure. Honey. Awe, wait! I'm gonna throw up! What? You feel like throwing up? - Yeah, and... - Need a plastic bag? Something stinks. What, it stinks? Honey, I'm so sorry, but I can't do it. I'm going to sleep. It must be the crushed persimmons. Awe, just my luck! Lie flat on your back. Put the pillow under your head. - Honey. - Yeah? I never married you for your money. I married you because you're a good guy. Oh! Everyone hand in your offerings as soon as we get to church, alright? You can't forget and bring it all back. like last time, okay? By the way, honey it seems a small amount's missing from your tithe What do you mean? Why's some missing? You always take it directly out of my back account. But weren't you paid for a special lecture last month? Ah... Oh that. Have you spent it on something else? It's fine if you did that. I'm just checking in case you forgot. There was an occasion I had to take care of. Ah... Like what? Hey. If it's hard to explain, then don't. No, I just want to be by your side. Did I beg you to be my boyfriend? I just want to be with you, why aren't you taking my calls? You're with that girl? It's fine! I'll go there. Wait, don't hang up. What? - Uh? - Well... What do you want?! About yesterday, I messed up the living room while I was moving the plants. It's not like you've got the wrong idea, right? Wait, don't hang up. Just wipe the blood off. I'm on my way to your concert, stay right there. Ah, for god's sake! God's words that touch our hearts today are Deut. 6:1-13. Ms. Jeon! Ms. Jeon! Up there. Assuming you've all found the verses, I'll start reading. These are the commands, decrees and laws. the Lord, your God directed me to teach you. Yes. And who are you...? Deaconess Jeon Mi-yeon's younger sister. - Ah, our church conductor. - Yes. - Her real sister? - Yes, the church conductor. I see. I never realized Ms. Jeon had a younger sister. - Nice to meet you. - I see, nice to meet you. - Would you like some? - No, we rarely take salty... I was blessed with God's grace by your sermon today. - You were? - Yes. Sis! See you later. Sis. Sis! Hey! Jeon Mi-yeon! What's your problem? I came here cause I missed you. Are you embarrassed of me? Wow, this is so good. Sis, aren't you eating? Just enjoy your meal. So, did you finally remember the name of that diner? What diner? Sis, do you mind if I skip dad's birthday? What's it this time? Dad was so hurt. when you missed last Thanksgiving gathering. Fine, I'll go then. What about big sis? Is she coming? Who knows, she's always in her own world. Who cares if she's coming or not. She never calls. Why am I always doing all the work for dad's birthday? To be honest, when she got married, she got all her wedding gifts from the department store, while I had to get my things from the outlet discount shop. Everything was a carryover Not even one brand new item. Still, her in-laws were totally dissatisfied. Right! No one forced her. to marry such an awful family! Did big sis pay you back? Why do you ask? Did she pay your husband back? No, but she doesn't owe us that much. Besides, my hubby isn't interested in getting his money back. That's what I mean. I just don't get her. I try not to call her. I don't want her to feel pressured. So she should be the one calling me. She always makes me look like a bad person. To be honest, has she done anything for us? Hey, did you get anything from her? She gave me pocket money a few times. When she used to be working. Did she? I guess I did too... A couple of times? But I feel sorry for big sis. For what? Hey! It was purely her choice, okay? No one forced her to marry a loser. Did we? No, that's not what I mean. Hasn't she gone through the most in the family? Everything's my fault. I messed up as the mediator. I blame myself. Come on, no one's saying it's your fault. How's Jin-sup? Jin-sup's okay. Everything's A-okay with him. When I visited him last time he was eating well. He seems to be okay now. He's much better. I hate seeing him because it drives me mad when I see him like that. The old folks are wasting their golden years on him. Mi-ok. Try to be kinder to them, okay? They won't be living forever, you know? You're such a good daughter, sis. I'm sorry. I'm late. I'm sorry. - Let's start now. - Okay. So... By the way, where's Hyo-jeong? She went to return her choir gown after church service. - Should I call her? - Ah... Is that so? Then, spare me a minute while I run to the church office. I need to copy a music score. Meanwhile, warm up your throats. Okay. Just give me a moment. - I need to go. - Shhhh. Just be still. The Lord has planned this for me. How thankful I am. Ms. Jeon? Let's just call it a day. Thank you. - Thank you. - Why are you late? Where were you? - Hyo-jeong? - Yes? You're coming to the prayer service, aren't you? Of course. - I'll see you then. - Yes. I hate your ugly face. and your ugly. Get rid of it all. Should I just rip it all up? Rip it all up? Just rip it up? Rip it up? Rip it up? Rip it up! Sacred blood has killed the mic. So the concert ends here. Brought to you by Blood Poop. Thank you. See you later. - Hello. - Hello. Are you really - Bo-mi's mother? - Yes. Wow, such a different vibe. Ah, well... Wanna go up for a smoke? I don't smoke. Do you love Bo-mi? Sorry to be so blunt when we've just met. If that's what you're here for, don't worry too much. It's not a sexual relationship. Besides, I don't like jumping into the sack with women. So you're not attracted to Bo-mi? It's not really me being attracted or not, it's just that she's just another girl attracted to me. I'm sorry for being so up front. That must hurt. But it makes you feel better for now, doesn't it? I'm not sure why, but... it's true, isn't it? Uh. Mr. Blood Poop, I know you're a good person. But... Bo-mi needs to be with a better person. I'm sorry. We're total strangers, and this is so inappropriate. I'm so sorry. I really am. I am sure you're a good person Mr. Blood Poop. Of course. But Bo-mi needs to be with a really good person. Oh, Father! Lord! Lord! Lord! Lord! Lord! Help me, Lord! Pull the blanket over your head. Sorry? Pull the blanket over your head. Ah, the blanket... Pull it right over your head. Shhh. Right before breakfast, I want you to return the ring. You hear? I guess I'm the last to be here. - Did you sleep well? - Good morning. Why are you eating so late? I must have been tired. I overslept. - You're all done? - Yes. We're the last ones here. Hyo-jeong seems really sick. Her face is swollen all over. Really? That's too bad. She must have come down with something. I'm driving her to the hospital. Yes, you should take her to the hospital. - Enjoy your meal, Ms. Jeon. - Okay. - Let's go. - See you later. Hyo-jeong, go straight to the hospital. - Take care. - Rest well. Hyo-jeong! Is it that bad? Get enough rest. We can't have a sick soloist. It's your job to be in best condition, okay? Do you understand? Yes. Hyo-jeong, make sure you pray. I'll pray for you as well. Now let's wrap things up and go home. - Yes, ma'am. - Let's go. Lord... Try it. It's really sweet. Maybe later. Why are you still here? Aren't you going to bed? I'm not sleepy. I'm bored. What're you doing? I'm working on something important. Hey, stop studying so hard, okay? Stop acting so snotty cause you get good grades. 'Namaste' Hey, isn't this funny? Is it just me? You're such a bummer. You worry me. Hey, look over here. 'My precious...' Look, I turned you into Golum. Jeez. What will make you laugh? Too bad you haven't got a sense of humor. You'll turn out to be just like your dad. Jeez. Why do you always dye your hair blond? Who me? What about it? Hey. Who says Asians always have to have black hair? Dump those clichés. The world is one. We are the world. We are the children. Too bad. Such a pity. My mother doesn't dye her hair like that. Who? Oh, your mother? Of course your mother and I are totally different. Come on. I need to go to the toilet. (MOM CAN YOU COME FOR SCHOOL COUNSELLING?) (IS YOUR STEPMOM BUSY?) (NO, BUT SHE EMBARRASSES ME) (MY POOR BOY OKAY, SEE YOU AT SCHOOL) Mom. I'll just say grace this time. I'm hungry. No, we can all eat only after Ha-eun says grace. Wait, Ha Seung-woo. Honey, the kids are hungry, let's just eat. Ha-eun, is it still hard for you? Your feelings of fear and reservations are not godly, understand? What's inside your heart? - Is it Satan? - Honey. What message did God give our family at New Year? He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least - is unjust also in much. - Good. - Luke 16:10. - Luke 16:10. - Amen. - Amen. If you can't say grace at the table, how will you do church service? Do you want to go to hell alone? What are you doing? You're frightening her. Go answer the phone, it's yours! Ha-eun, why are you crying? Stop it. Ha-eun, mommy said stop. Okay? - Ha-eun? - Stop crying, Ha-eun! - Come! - Jeez. Stop it! Get in your room! Get on your knees! And pray, you hear? For the strength to say grace! Pray hard! Kneel! Eat. Yeah, what? What's up? Are you angry, sis? No. I'm not angry. So, Did you have dinner? No. Then come over to my place and make me dinner. Mi-ok. From now on, you should cook meals for Sung-woon, okay? He's going to high school. How about being more motherly? Your husband might seem ok, but he could resent you later. Okay? Sis. Then teach me. What does a mom need to do? Sis, for the life of me, I don't know what a mom's supposed to do. No one learns how to be one, Mi-ok. Just treat them with love. They're the gifts of God. All our children are. Mi-ok, Mi-ok? Anyone can be one. Anyone can work at it, okay? Awe... - Sis. - Yeah? It must be nice for Seung-woo and Ha-eun. to have you as their mother. Has Seung-woo lost some weight? Not really. Stop snacking so much, okay? You're not calling cause you've got something to say, are you? - It's just that, sis, I... - Yeah. I've got this burning question. There's this thing that keeps coming up. Like what? What's it about? Sis. I was around five, on this really cold winter's day. We ran barefoot like crazy to the supermarket, right? Do you remember why? Was it to get ice cream? - Uh, we did that? - Yeah. You held my hand tightly as we ran. Yeah, that I remember, but not why. How about you, sis? No, I don't remember I need to go, Mi-ok. Eat a proper meal. You need to eat, you hear? I'll call you later. Call me if you remember. Ah, Lord... (KIM SUNG-WOON) (CRAZY PRICK) I'm really sorry, Ha-eun. I'm sorry. Are you done getting ready? What is this? Ah, that. I just got back what you lost. It's all God's plan, for me to get it back. How fortunate. Thank you Lord. Wear this today. Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Just curse me out. Scream or vent it out for fool's sake. What for? You crazy prick. You'll never change. If God doesn't heal you. You'll never change. For fool's sake...Damn! - What's going on, mommy? - Huh? Where's dad going? It's nothing, just get ready. I sing out loud to praise our precious Lord. Praise the Lord with joy. Praise with joy. I sing out loud to praise our great Lord. Praise the Lord with joy. Our precious Lord. Our precious Lord. Praise our precious Lord. Praise the Lord with joy. Praise with Joy. I praise our great Lord. Praise the Lord with joy. Our Lord's plan for me is such a blessing. - Amen. - Amen! Go to your rooms. - Okay. - Huh? (I WILL STAY AT MY SCHOOL FOR THE TIME BEING) (DON'T CONTACT ME I'LL CONTACT YOU) As you wish. Father! Mommy. Ha-eun, what's the matter? I'm sorry. From now on I'll say grace well. Come here, Ha-eun. Oh, Father. Oh, Lord. It's okay. It's not because of you, Ha-eun. My baby, it's okay. My baby, everything's okay. Yes, Mom. Uh, yes. Ah, no. It's just that Ha-eun was crying. Everything's okay now. Yeah, what's up? Big sis? Why? Is she asking for money again? - Hello there. - Yes, hello. You have such a nice smile. Oh, thank you. You seem to have a pure soul. You've never seen anyone like her, have you? Right, I see you're projecting so much soulful energy. You have such a nice first impression. You hear that a lot, don't you? Ah, yes... I'm sorry, I'm a bit... I have to make this delivery. I'm sorry. Losing sleep over worrying about your kids and husband? There's nothing else but this, you need to cast away the seven evil spirits. (OUT FOR DELIVERY) Uh, Mi-yeon. I'm really sorry, I'm out on a delivery. When am I done? We're just about to begin. Mi-yeon. I'm almost done. Can you wait a little bit? I'm really sorry. Right, I won't take long. Okay! Do you believe in being reborn by casting away the seven evil spirits? Excuse me? Once this is over, will I be done? For a new rebirth, in the name of the Eternal One, I baptize you. Now you may go under. You can go under water, it's okay. Relax, yes. That's it. Right. Yes down further. Good. Now all the way. That's it. All the way. More? You need to go all the way. Mi-yeon. I'm so sorry. Sorry to keep you waiting so long. I'm so sorry. What happened to you? Were you at the bath house? It's cold. It's the first time you're at my shop, isn't it? I know. The shop's so blah. I'm embarrassed. What for? It's a nice place. And so many kinds of flowers. - How's the business? - What do you mean? It's all so boring. I kept you waiting too long, didn't I? I'm so sorry. Sorry the chair's so dirty. Sit here. What're you so sorry and embarrassed for your entire life? You need a new haircut. This place still seems quite hot. Just like it used to be long ago. Did you come here a lot? You know this place? Remember? This place is near the office you used to work at. Right, I came here a lot. Bo-mi's dad loved the black bean noodles here. I see you don't remember. A month after I moved to Seoul, we watched a movie together near this place. Titanic! You cried your eyes out when DiCaprio froze to death. I was embarrassed to death. Don't you remember? So I came here with you. You promised to treat me on your first paycheck day and this is where you brought me. I see. What's wrong? Having another stomachache? Go to the toilet. I'm okay. Sorry. I said sorry again, didn't I? I'm hopeless. It was 'Sunrise'. It was Sunrise Diner. - Huh? What was that? - Nothing. Here's your order. What about your husband? Does he stop by? The private loan he took out, he never paid up, did he? Yeah, I'm really so sorry. I should pay you back right away. I'll start paying you little by little from next month. Sis. It's okay. I shouldn't have brought it up. We're no strangers, you know? We're family. Sometimes you can let it slide. Everyone does it. I... feel bad that you're living like this. If I were rich, I would've already moved you out of here... Do you go to church? You don't, do you? Well I'm planning to. You should start going, okay? You can't live like this forever. I'm planning to go from now on. Everything's okay with you, right? Yeah, well. Anyway! - You should get going. - Right. About Bo-mi, all's well with her, right? She's fine. There's nothing like family It means a lot to me. I'll be going now. I'm serious. Call me, okay? Stop sitting on your problems. I'll try to call you more often from now on. See you. - See you later. - Okay. Okay, see you. Mom, dad, I'm sick. Who do you think you are? What's the matter? I hate this filthy household! Seriously, I'm leaving! I'm not kidding! Bo-mi, I've got cancer. What the heck. Damn. You're happy that mommy won't live long, right? Damn. Goddamn it, you must be out of your mind! Are you nuts? - Let go! - Bo-mi. I'm scared. I'm a little scared. Am I that pathetic to you? What do I have to do to make people not dislike me? You piss me off. Are you off to school? Yes. You seem to be in a good mood today? Just so so. Honey. Are you done with classes? Yes, I'll be out in a minute. I'll wait for you outside. What brings you here? I've got another class to do. Are you slapping me with a divorce? Is my tone bothering you? Anyway, I'm 2 years older than you. So no more good wife, ok? Back off. Would you divorce me if I ask to? Yeah, okay. Let's get a divorce. But first things first, and that's a settlement. The kids and I need to live in the apartment, so pay the mortgage balance. as well as the $50,000 you borrowed from me to buy your professor job here. You were upset at me when I lent my sister the stashed cash behine you. Remember? Who do you think paid your brother's surgery bill? I secretly lent him $30,000. I want you to pay it back. And then we can get a divorce. Don't you know 'competence' is a must when you want a divorce. How dare you mention you want a divorce? Here. You horny scumbag, make sure you call the kids once a day. I'm concerned he's not comfortable articulating feelings or thoughts... - Hello. - Yes. - Hello. - Yes, hello. Did you come together? No, we came separately. Ma'am, can you spare a moment? Uh, yes. I'm sorry. She's Sung-woon's stepmother. There must be a misunderstanding. Why don't we just call it a day. I can always come back later. Sure, sure, sure. - Thank you for your time. - Thank you. This counseling session's done for the day... Excuse me. I'd like to get some counseling. I'm here to get counseling. That's all for today. I have another parent waiting. But I'm a parent too. Kim Sung-woon's mother. Yes, but his biological mother already received counseling. But I'm his mother too. I also want to be a good mother. Stop bothering the teacher and let's go, okay? You can't just come to school drunk like this. Why don't we go? But I'm also a parent, and I want to do well as a mother, you know. You're no mother. You don't deserve it. What about you? Huh? Who gave you the right to be a mother, for fool's sake? What's the matter with you? - Ma'am calm down. - I'm so sorry, ma'am. It's okay, it's time to go. How come you won't give me counseling? What's the goddamn problem?! - Calm down and take it outside. - Huh?! Why won't you give me counseling?! Ma'am, please take it outside. Let go, goddamn it! How come you're refusing to give me counseling, goddamn it?! Not here, let's take it outside, okay? Why do you keep telling me to take it outside? Damn. Kim Sung-woon.

It'll be the day you die. Eat. How's the soup? Tastes great. - It, it's good. - Eat up. You know, my problem is I rarely cook, but when I do, I'm da bomb. - Make sure to chew properly. - Okay. I'll bring you water. - Mi-yeon, we're here! - Yeah, sis! Hi there, Bo-mi. You're prettier than ever. Bo-mi, aren't you happy to see your aunt after so long. Bo-mi, auntie's talking to you. What's the matter? She's not normally like this. - Get in. - It's heavy. Bo-mi. Isn't it a devil worshipping song, is it? Shut up, you goddamn fatty. - Mommy! - Huh? She called me a goddamn fatty! Oh my.. - Did you say that? - Hey, Bo-mi! What's your problem, Bo-mi? I'm so sorry Seung-woo. My apologies for Bo-mi. She's a bit mad at auntie. Sorry, okay? Kids are kids. It's no big deal. Bo-mi? Yes, he is fat, but no need to curse him for it. You know it bums him out enough, already. Bo-mi, auntie's talking to you! - Stop bugging me! - Okay, fine. Now let's pray first and then get going. Lord, we thank you. Our two families are gathered to set out on this long journey. Please Father, keep us safe until the end of our trip. Deliver us safe and sound... I love you. With two hearts intertwined. Whisper words of love to me. Your kind smile tells me that you love me. Your sweet voice. This neighborhood just doesn't change. Kids, we're almost there. Huh? You need to wake up. Sung-woon! You're here. Welcome. - Hello there. - Hi there. - You're early. - Yes, I'll take that. Wow, Bo-mi, you're getting prettier every time. - You lose! - I did not! - You did. - I said, I did not. Hey, Jeon Mi-ok. Get over here. Hey, sis, you lose! Hey, Jeon Jin-sup! - Honey! Honey! - Come out! - Hey, your sisters are here. - Now! - Hey! - Honey! Jeon Jin-sup! Come out, now. Jeon Mi-ok, what's the matter? It's no big deal. She's mad because Jin-sup talked back to her. Come out, now! Stop it. You're causing such a racket. Change your clothes. - Mom, we're here. - Good. Where's Hee-sook? - I'm here, mom. - Uh, good. You must be hungry. No, we had enough at the service area. Mom, where's dad? He went to church for elders' gathering. I'll set the table for dinner. - You're dead meat. - That's enough. Honey, that's enough, okay? Your sisters are here. What do you mean it's enough? How can he say that to me? 'There you go again crazy prick'? Come out, now. He's just happy to see you, right? Your sisters are here, say hi. I'll see you later. Mi-ok. - You've lost weight. - Really? - She's right, sis. - No way. Look how pretty you've gotten? Mi-ok, I've missed you a lot. Sorry for not calling often. Did you come like this? What's wrong? - Is there a problem? - No, you look great! Honey, isn't this you? What? And there're your sisters next to you, right? Hey, my wife's the prettiest. Sis, you should sing. I don't know this song. Then dance at least. The grownups are all waiting for you. You! If you're not gonna do it, then just forget about it! Just come over here, will you? Eat this and go home. Your wife's waiting for you. Just go! Turn the music on! And dance! - What's the problem? - Hey, kids. What's going on? Aren't you cold, little girls? Why aren't you wearing any shoes? What is it? You want something? No. We're not here to buy something. Aren't you Man-sup's girls who live up the road? How come you're running around like that? - Ah, right. - You're gonna catch colds! We're not cold. We're not cold at all cause we've been running. Look how much you've grown. Huh? How old are you? Don't you have an older sister? The one that your dad brought from somewhere else. Right? Yes, you're right. But dad's beating her now. That's why only two of us are here. What? He's doing what? Your dad's drinking again, and beating your mom? No he's not. He doesn't hit mom that much anymore. He just hits big sis and Jin-sup now. Is that so? I guess he feels sorry to your mom. for bringing home a lovechild. Yes. So he's not hitting you two? No. He just hits big sis and Jin-sup. Man-sup won't ever kick his drinking habits. Never, ever. You should have begged your daddy like, 'Stop, you'll beat sis to death'. That's what you should've done. You can't just run away like that. - Right? - Yes, sir. Then can you file a police report for us? File a police report? Can you believe that? Hey you punks. If you do that to your daddy, they'll take him away and handcuff him! He'll then get a criminal record. You want him to become a criminal and ruin his life? Hurry home and beg him. Beg him to forgive you. - Go and beg him! - Okay, okay. - Go beg for his forgiveness. - That's enough. Hey, can you give them each a freezie? Look, I'll buy you freezies. Have one each and run home. Lord this poor father desperately prays to you. The entire family has come to gather at this place. This old, helpless, worthless and poor father's birthday was remembered, and became this congregation because of you Lord. Please bless our children more than ever, and with everything they do, from a place where your grace shines brightly, may their services be used and valued by others. Amen. Our eldest daughter, Jeon Hee-sook runs a flower shop in Seoul. She creates beautiful flower baskets. Oh! - Oh! - Oh my! - Oh! - What are you doing?! Jin-sup! Sang-joon, please hold Jin-sup! - Oh my. - I'm sorry. Forgive me, Pastor. - It's all your goddamn fault! - Mom, take dad out. - You scumbag! - I'm so sorry, Pastor. - Honey, honey? - You scumbag!

Get a grip on yourself, you ass! Hey, stop hitting him. Mi-yeon, it's all my fault. I'm so sorry. Stop being so hard on Jin-sup. Sis, stop blaming yourself. You didn't do anything wrong. So stop saying you're sorry, ok? Right, right. It's all because I'm so pathetic. I'm so sorry. Can't you see Jin-sup's sick? Don't be like that. Move aside, sis. Get out of the way. - I said, get out of the way! - Stop it. This won't solve anything. Step aside, now! Let go! Forget it all, give it a rest for fool's sake! That's enough drinking. Give it back! Who do you think you are?! You think you make the rules in this family? Are you insane? Are you? Do you even remember calling drunk and rambling each night? And your terrific memory won't keep your husband from divorcing you, will it? What did you just say? You thought I didn't know? He said he's so sick of you. Shut up. Your eyes look just like dad's when we were young! I said, shut up! Hey! Don't you feel sorry for your kids! I want you all to stop it, now! Stop it right now! Oh my, what in the world? Are you all out of your minds? I'm sorry. Forgive me. - I'm so sorry. - What the heck is this?! What the heck do you think you're doing?! Dad? Dad, I want you to apologize. What's that? Not to the pastor, but to us. Okay? To Jin-sup, big sis, Mi-ok, all of us! Apologize to us. - We'll take this at home later. - Not later! You need to apologize now. - You need to calm down and... - Pastor. I'm sorry to say this, Okay? But you have no clue. So butt out. My apologies. Mi-yeon! How dare you talk to the pastor like that! Dad? Dad? So you're not really going to apologize to us? Mi-yeon! Not you now, stop it! You want to be the death of me?! Mom. Why would you die? Don't die, Mom. Dad, you know. I said this prayer when I was nine. Father, our Lord, when morning comes may our entire family except for my dad be dead, please. May our family except for my dad live happily, happily ever after in heaven. Please Lord, our Father let us be dead in the morning. I want us all go to heaven except for dad, Father. Your father isn't like that anymore. He's not the father he used to be. Is your stomach upset again? It's okay. Let's go home, now. Damn, why is it so hard for adults to apologize? My mom's got cancer! Apologize now, grandpa! I said my mom's got cancer for fool's sake! What's the matter, Bo-mi. Stop acting like that. She's lived like a loser and now she's dying from cancer! So apologize now! No, stop. What is wrong with her?! Sis! You have cancer? For real? What kind? Tell me! I'm planning to get medical treatment soon. These days you don't die from cancer. Mi-yeon. Hold on. Pastor, I'm so sorry about this. He didn't pee on this side. She booked this place at $500. You might as well just have some food. Look here. There's no pee on this side See, I'm eating! Everyone, come and eat! Mom, come. Dad, let's all just eat. There's no pee on this side. Sis, are you gonna die? I'm not gonna die, no! Wait a sec, Mi-yeon. - Let's just eat. - Hee-sook! - Hee-sook. - Stop it, stop. - Hee-sook, sorry, I'm so sorry. - Hey. I'm so sorry, so sorry. What should we do? My poor baby. This place was booked for $500, so for Christ's sake, stop! Let's eat, for Christ's sake! - I'm so sorry. - I'm not going to die! I'm so sorry.

You definitely take after dad's drinking habits. I can't believe you want a drink again. Hey, I'm not the only one who takes after dad. We all do. Besides, your personality takes after him the most. That wound on his forehead will stand out on his bald head. It's gonna look darn ugly, won't it? Let's go somewhere nice and expensive. - And you pick up the tab, sis. - Oh, alright. Let's go. Sorry girls, can I ask you a favor? Now, where should we take the photo? - This place all looks nice. - Yeah? Where? Sis, let's take it here! Over here, come here. - Right here. - Right. Now, stand close to each other. Ta da. Jeez sis, this isn't a big deal to ask for. Remember the photo we took at the beach when we were young? That's the only one with three of us. - Yeah? - Yeah. Awe, I hate that photo. - Let's take lots from now on. - Yeah. - Now, look at the camera. - Okay. One, two, three! Don't tell me my love isn't love. (Jang Yoon-ju Moon So-ri Kim Sun-young) For me to walk a road that cannot be seen, don't tell me my feelings are just hope I dream of in vain. Please don't mock my reckless desiring to climb a mountain with no peak. (THREE SISTERS) I lost the way when I let go of your two hands. But I cannot stop as this is the way I love you. I lost the way when I let go of your two hands. But I cannot stop as this is the way I love you. Don't tell me my love isn't love. Don't try to persuade me this isn't love because I wish to walk my own path without you. Should I rip it up if that's your wish. Should I rip it up if you are fine with it. All that remains for me is meaningless. Should I rip it up? I hate your ugly face and your ugly family. Even the mouth that spews trash from it. Oh how I wish to rip it all up. Should I rip it all up? Should I rip it all up? Just rip it up? Rip it up? Just rip it up? Rip it up? Just rip it up? Rip it up?
