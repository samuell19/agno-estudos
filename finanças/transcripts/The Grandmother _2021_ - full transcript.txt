Soft charm and placidity From that corner of my childhood THE GRANDMOTHER Heart that beats today In a foreign body Suffocated in a modern hotel Bud green, sweet and good Between the peg and the wall Magical presence of yesterday Love that makes me come back To immerse myself in your spell And stun me again and again Unhappy corner of luxury hotel Happy garden of my childhood Up, up, up... Yes, look at me. You're looking fashionable. Yes. Nana, I've been calling you, but you're not answering. I'm not going to make it to Madrid for our birthdays. I'm sorry. The thing is, I got this great job! It's not confirmed yet, but it would be on the 22nd. I'll try to come home ASAP. I really miss you. Call me when you get this. Love you loads. Take care. - How are you? - Fine and you? - Fine... - Yeah? Have you seen...? Have you seen Elvira? Have you seen Elvira? Yes! On the... There on the stairs... Hey! - Susana! How was the shoot? - Good! - And the test? - Pretty good, let's see what they say. Sorry. I'm so rude! This is Zoe. She's going to be working with us. - Nice to meet you. - Same here. - Is he here? - Don't look now. He's upstairs. Everyone's in love with little girls. They say: "Eric, let me introduce you to a girl", and then it's a 13-year-old kid! What can a 13-year-old know about life? Pass me your mobile. What can a 13-year-old model do? Stand there with her tongue out like some kind of idiot? You have to work with models who are at the end of their career. But what's most important of all is that they know it. There's nothing more powerful than a flame that's about to go out. Everyone ignores me. Then I do a campaign with a woman who's 28, 30, 35... and bang, everyone goes crazy. But the next day... they're saying to me again: "Eric, come meet this girl", and they introduce me to another 13 year old. That's what I do. That's what I'm there for, to tell them over and over again. You know the funniest thing? I always do the same thing and they keep paying me more and more. How old are you? 25. Well, 24 until next Tuesday. See? She's old! So fucking old! - How long you been in Paris? - Six years. - And what have you done? - Well... Shampoo, perfumes... So you've done nothing. Nothing! Come to my studio tomorrow. Talk to my P.A. I want her there at 10. Of course! This is your lucky day. UNKOWN NUMBER SPAIN Answer it! Put it on speaker phone. Hello? - Hello? - Hello. - Susana Lazaro? - Yes, speaking. This is Saint Gabriel's Hospital, in Madrid. Yes? Your grandmother's had an accident. She's here at the hospital. You are her emergency contact. - Yes, OK. One moment. - What's wrong? Is she OK now? She's stable, but still unconscious. We're doing some tests. As you're the only relative we know of, we need you to come as soon as possible. Sure... Sure, of course I will. Thank you. Nana? Nana! Nana? Nana! Welcome to the Airport Adolfo Su√°rez of Madrid. You have landed at Terminal T4S. Here are some simple guidelines to get you to your destination... Hello. - Susana? - Yes. - It's a pleasure, I'm Dr. Romero. - Nice to meet you. I've been taking care of your grandma. Have a seat. Susana... Your grandmother has suffered a brain hemorrhage. This occurs when a blood vessel bursts. The blood spills out and damages the brain tissue. Luckily, your grandmother had left her front door open, probably by accident, and a neighbor found her. If she hadn't, the outcome would probably have been fatal. The hemorrhage has affected a large part of her brain. And that is going to affect her life from now on. From now on... your grandmother will be partially dependent. She will need a lot of help. Her motor skills will be affected, her ability to talk... and it's possible she may not recognize you. Are there any other relatives who can help? No. My parents died in an accident when I was little and... it's always been just the two of us. There's no one else. Do you live with her? I live in Paris. Then I suggest you look for a home, where all your grandmother's needs can be met. If you don't mind, the hospital suggests this center for those relatives with problems like your grandmother's. Thanks, but I think I'll find someone to care for her. I'd like her to be able to stay in the house she's always lived in. - I understand. - It is possible she might get better? No. Fuck... OK... Come on, Nana. - 'S' of Seville. - With 'S' we have... three!" Nana, "The Wheel of Fortune". How's your grandma? Well, I don't know. I don't know if she recognizes me, if she knows what's happened to her... She doesn't talk. They said she can't look after herself anymore. Honestly, she's in a bad way, but at least she's home now. And you? How are you doing? Not good. I feel so sad. I still can't believe it. We talked just a week ago and everything was fine. She'd been to the park and was excited about seeing me on our birthday. Listen, I'm sorry I missed the meeting with the photographer. Don't worry about that. There is no problem. I took Zoe in the end. Zoe who? The girl I introduced you to at the party. I'm sorry, but I have to go now. I'm here if you need anything. A kiss. And another one for your grandmother. That's it! That's it. Come on, just one more. Well done, Nana! Nana? Nana? Nana! Nana, spit it out! Nana, spit it out! Nana! Nana! It's OK, you're fine now. You're OK now. Good night. Nana! Nana, what's wrong? Are you OK? Talk to the patient and inform them of the technique we'll be carrying out. Remove the blanket and the bedspread. Check that the waterproof sheet is fitted. If not, fit it by moving the patient as necessary. Help the patient into a comfortable position. Turn the patient onto their side. Lay the waterproof sheet on the bed, then roll the patient back onto their back, in order to wash their genitals. Their legs should be spread, so that you can see the perineum. Clean the patient with toilet paper or wet wipes. After washing, cream can be applied to the genitals, sacrum and buttocks. Open the new nappy and lay it on the bed. Adjust to fit the waist and then fasten the ties. Make sure it is tight enough. To finish, leave the person in a comfortable position, with the bed made and the room tidy. Good night. Nana. Nana. Nana! Nana, you have to eat. Nana. Nana. Hello? Susana! You gave me such a fright! Sorry, I didn't realize you were home. Sorry, but who are you? I'm Eva. Our grandmas were friends. We met ages ago, I'm not surprised you don't remember. What are you doing here? I visit your grandma from time to time. I help her in the house, run errands for her. We go out to the park. Right, Pilar? How did you get in? Your grandma gave me the key. She wasn't answering, so I just let myself in. I was worried. I hadn't been able to get in touch with her for days. What happened to her? Relax or fruits of the forest? - Fruits of the forest. - OK. This... and the kettle... It's here, look. Let me make it. - Everything's kind of a mess. - Thanks. It's so strange. I just called her last week and... she was fine. And now seeing her like this... It's shaken me up a bit. I'm sorry. Had you been visiting her long? She never mentioned you. Three or four months, more or less. My grandma was sick too, so I had to leave the Canary Islands and come live with her here, in Madrid. It's the least I could do. How is she? She died. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. I mean, it's really sad seeing them like this, but then I think... They're sick because they're old and if they're old, it's because they've had long lives. She's been so excited about celebrating this birthday with you. So, what are you going to do? I'm going to find someone to look after her. I don't want to put her in a home. But you'll be here for your birthdays, won't you? - Well... - I'd love to drop by. I'm not sure yet. Right... I see. I'm sure you're needed in Paris. You know a lot about me. Sorry, I'm so indiscreet sometimes. It's just that your grandma has told me all about you. She's shown me all your photos, the magazines, all the adverts... Susana, she's so proud of you. It's been great to see you again. Good to see you again too. And listen, thanks for looking after my grandma. CARE FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE Yes, in Madrid. I live in France, but I'd be back as often as possible. I'd call every... I understand. I understand, thank you. She's 85... and would need 24-hour care. She needs to be washed, put to bed, moved... Fed. OK, don't worry. Thank you. Yes, in Madrid. Perfect. So you can do it? That's great! When can you meet? The day after tomorrow? Great. HOW ARE YOU? HOW'S YOUR GRANDMA? WHEN ARE YOU BACK? GETTING THINGS SORTED SO I CAN COME BACK ASAP. SHOULD BE SOON. KISSES! Nana? Who are you talking to? Nana? Nana, are you OK? Open up! Nana, what's wrong? Nana! Nana! Nana, what's wrong with you? Fuck! Emergency services from... HEY! HOW'S YOUR GRANDMA? WHEN YOU COMING BACK? I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO BE BACK ASAP. I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE LONG. LOVE YOU! GLAD YOUR GRANDMA'S BETTER. TAKE CARE! What an impressive start! Very good. Hey, look, actually... you could have gone to your own right away, because you sing well. You have managed to dilute very well. Here they are... Hot, hot... The slit in your skirt... Through the slit in your skirt I broke three strings on this guitar Through the slit in your skirt I broke three strings on this guitar Through the slit in your skirt... RETIRO PARK AHUEHUETE I LOVE YOU LOADS, NANA "Today we visited the natural history museum." There were all kinds of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals. My favorite was the dimetrodon, "because it had a fan on its back." BIRTHDAY 22ND MARCH "This year, on our birthday, one of Nana's friends came." Her name's Julita. Nana told me they've been friends for a really long time. She's the first friend of Nana's I've met. Sharing a birthday with your Nana is kind of a pain, but Julita's granddaughter came too. Her name's Eva, and she's my age. Nana made punch and we had so much fun. It tasted funny, but good, and we kept asking for more. BIRTHDAY THEY CUT MY HAIR They cut my hair. "That night I dreamt of Nana and I was really scared." Nana... Nana, I was reading the diary I wrote when I was little. It's funny, because I was... I was reading it, but... I didn't remember any of it. None of what I'd written. There was a bit about a dinosaur I saw on a school trip. It's normal I don't remember that. But I also wrote about one of our birthdays, when a friend of yours came to see us... Julita. I know I was really little, but I don't remember it. I don't remember anything. I wrote about these strange dreams. And I said I was scared... Scared of you. I don't know why I'm telling you this. It doesn't matter what I tell you. I could sing you a song, tell you about a film... I could tell you who I hooked up with on New Year's Eve. You can't hear me. You're not here. There's no one in there, is there? There is the hidden letter. For you who are at home, along with the tip: "With true friends". That's the tip we have. Now... - Susana? - Hi! I was just calling to tell you I've found someone to look after Nana. We're meeting tomorrow, so if all goes well, I'll be back the day after. I can't talk now. I'm at a runway show. - I'll call you tonight, OK? - Sure. I'm glad things are sorting themselves out. Kisses. Kisses! Nana? Nana! She's around five foot four... And her hair is white. Yes. No. She's very slim. Yes. Her clothes? I don't... I don't remember. When I saw her she was in her nightie. I guess... Yes? OK. What hospital? OK, I'll be right there. Nana, where were you? Nana, where were you? Did you leave the house? Nana, just move your head. Shake or nod your head. Did you go out on your own? You scared the life out of me. You mustn't do that. Nana, answer me, please! Nana! Nana, eat. Nana! Clock, do not mark the time Cause I'm going crazy She will be gone forever When it dawns again Clock, stop your way... SEARCHING FOR FLIGHTS TO PARIS ONE MOMENT PLEASE Good morning! - Good morning. - Susana? - Yes. - I'm Adela. - We spoke on the phone. - Sure! Please, come in. No need to be so formal. We're still young! Like I said on the phone, my grandma needs round-the-clock care. I have to leave because of... Pilar? Pilar... Hello, Pilar. Nice to meet you. My name is Adela. A-de-la. I'm going to live here with you. We'll be together while your granddaughter's away. We're going to get on really well, you'll see! When exactly are you going back to Paris? - Tomorrow afternoon, if that's OK. - Of course. No problem at all. Then I'll come by in the morning, around 11. I'd like to have time to get settled in and go over some things - with you before you leave. - Sure, that's fine. - See you tomorrow then, Susana! - See you tomorrow! - Ciao! - Ciao. Nana, I'm just going to pop out for a bit, OK? Adela seems lovely, doesn't she? Sorry, we're closing now. Are you OK? Has something happened? No... I'm just scared to death. Scared? That I'm going crazy. I hope you like it. You're going to be fine here. They're going to look after you. And I'm going to come and visit you. Whenever I can. I'm sorry. Leave your message and I will call you back as soon as possible. Hi, Elvira. How are you? I just wanted to let you know that everything with my grandma's been sorted... and I'm flying back to Paris tonight. I'm arriving pretty late, so... I imagine you'll be busy. I'll call you tomorrow. OK, take care. The devastating fire has destroyed a large part of the building, a nursing home in Madrid. The fire started around seven, when a sofa on the 3rd floor caught fire, causing dense smoke to spread rapidly through the building via the air vents. The emergency services had to act extremely quickly... NO SURVIVORS IN NURSING HOME FIRE NO SURVIVORS IN NURSING HOME FIRE Firefighters had to act quickly to evacuate the building completely. Ten crews of Firefighters from the Madrid City Council have been necessary, and also 30 ambulances... Four. Five. Fuck! NANA'S BIRTHDAY / MY BIRTHDAY Good evening. My grandmother has just passed away at home. She choked while she was having dinner. We were eating and suddenly she couldn't breathe. No, I'm here alone. Yes, she's definitely dead. I've checked. I didn't have a chance to call sooner. It all happened so quickly. Yes. Pilar Novella Espinosa. Alphonse XII Street, at 38. It's the first floor flat. OK. Sorry, but do you know how long they'll be? Can't they get here sooner? I see. OK, OK then. Thank you very much. Yes? Hello? Pilar? - Who is this? - Is that you? - No, this is Susana, her... - Are you sure? My body is yours. Your heart is mine. Clock, do not mark the time Cause I'm going crazy She will be gone forever When it dawns again We only have tonight To live out our love And your tick-tock reminds me My irremediable pain Clock, stop your way Because my life is fading She is the star That illuminates my being Without her love, I am nothing Stop the time in your hands Make this night perpetual So that she never leaves me So that it never dawns We only have tonight To live out our love And your tick-tock reminds me My irremediable pain Clock, stop your way Because my life is fading She is the star That illuminates my being Without her love, I am nothing Stop the time in your hands Make this night perpetual So that she never leaves me So that it never dawns So that it never dawns
