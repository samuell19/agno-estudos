Do you all know that we always run into people who do the same thing? But I want my life to be extraordinary. I'll make everyone see that I'm different from them. I know it. Most people say singing isn't a proper job for a high-school girl like me. But I don't care about what they think. Because I have faith that I, Lao lok Fong, will have a hit song one day. We will see if they can still make fun of me. I just had a wonderful dream. It's the start of another boring day at school. Stay tranquil and focused, Be humble and kind KO. Keep going. I don't have any more money. You don't? How do you like a punch in the face? Calm down, please. Let's be civil. You really don't have any money? Show me your wallet. Be quick. Gosh. You jerk sure don't have any money. Go on, get lost. Bring money next time if you want to play with me. Thank you, Boss Hong. Get lost! Remember Boss Hong's kindness. What a fortune. Come on, let's take a picture. Strike a cool pose. A cooler pose. Boss. Your phone screen is busted. It has nothing to do with me. Go away. Where's that girl with glasses? Where did she go? Is she over there? Hey! You still want to run? Where else can you go? Come here and have a chat. Pay for my phone. No? How about we take a look at your... wallet? Hey! It's you shrew again? You remember last semester... Enough! Let's skip the tough guy routine. What should we do, Boss? - Should we beat her up? - Yes. Go! You'd better surrender! Do you surrender? Screw yourself! Such dirty words. I'll fight you one-on-one if you dare! - What? - Sorry. - Louder. - I'm sorry. - I can't hear you. - I'm sorry! It's just a few days into the semester and you're already making trouble again. This time, you boys fought with a girl? Aren't you embarrassed? I gave you a chance last semester. I must punish you this time. You're all going to be given a major demerit. I don't really care about the major demerit because it wasn't my fault. You got into a fight again? Don't you want to go to school anymore? What's wrong with standing up to bullies? Should I just stand around and watch? You should help yourself before you help others. You never focus on your studies. You always do pointless things. Why does everyone think what the school does and says are always right? I don't think so. This school is full of ridiculous things as well. The teacher is so late. Are we not having music class now? All rise. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. Good morning, everyone. I am your music teacher for this semester, Cheong Chi Ian. You can call me Mr. Cheong. What kinds of music do you know? "Symphony No. 5". "Yellow River Cantata". "Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata". Forget it. You lot wouldn't appreciate high culture. Let's not waste time. Let's sing some pop music. But you should all come to the front and sing one by one. Hey, the chubby at the back is laughing. You, stand up. Let's sing "Even in Death I'll Love". Start from the chorus. Do you know it? Remember the lyrics? Look it up on your cell phone if you don't remember. Even in death, I'll love Not joyful unless totally unrestrained You stand like a giant but sing like a mosquito. Next. Even in death, I'll love Not joyful unless totally unrestrained Only deeper affection can be enough to vindicate Well... Sometimes, we need to show a little restraint. - Tone it down a bit. - A bit? Yes, a bit. Next. Even in death, I'll love Not joyful unless totally unrestrained Only deeper affection can in this way Be enough to vindicate Next. Even in death, I'll love Not joyful unless totally unrestrained Next. The girl with glasses, come forward. Next. Sir, let me sing. A volunteer? Congratulations. Even in death, I'll love Not joyful unless totally unrestrained Only deeper affection... Well, it was okay. But this is a version with a lower key. Try the original version. Even in death, I'll love Not joyful unless totally unrestrained Only deeper... The key is still a bit flat. Let's try again. Even in death, I'll love Not joy... You're straining too much. Let's try again. I'm done. You're playing games with me. Gosh, who taught you manners? Well, that's the end of class. End of my shift. Bye now. Why would the school hire this douchebag? To get rid of these unnecessary things, I have to be on my own. If I can't stand the heat, I should get out of the kitchen. When my opportunity knocks, I will be successful. Iok Fong, it's very difficult to get into a music college. Hundreds of candidates for every place. Talented students with high grades participate in many competitions to win awards. I'm just too lazy to join the competitions. That doesn't mean I'm not talented. I don't need awards to prove myself. Yes, you're right. It's really troublesome to get into the competitions. See for yourself. To enter, you need to be recommended by a qualified musician. There are so many hurdles. Registration Form Lao lok Fong. It's not that we don't want you to participate in the contest. It's just that we think you should focus on your studies. Although your grades aren't too bad, you're now in the 11th grade. Last semester, you had two subjects... Never mind. Thank you, sir. Hey. If you fail two subjects again like last semester, how will you pass through? And if you can't pass, you can't graduate. If you can't graduate, you can't find a job. Speaking of which, I am very worried. Hey, Lao lok Fong. Mr. Cheong. "Lao lok Fong, the Beef Jerky." Are you Lao lok Fong? Tell her to ask me herself. You don't have to be like this. Don't give me that attitude. This is a school. You should always show respect to your teachers. You are nothing like a teacher. Whatever. I'll let the disciplinary department deal with you. Entry to the Teen Original Music Contest is highly sought after. It's not for students who don't show respect and sing out of tune. You'd better not take part. What are you talking about? - Ms. Wong. - Ms. Wong. Iok Fong wants Mr. Cheong to recommend her for the music contest. - Mr. Cheong. - Yes. Iok Fong really likes music. She's really dedicated. I know. I have heard this from many people. Many students tell me that they love to listen to her singing. How about giving her an opportunity? Let me think about it. He's such a pervert around beautiful girls. I think it might be possible. You should thank Mr. Cheong. Say it. Thank you. Iok Fong, we'll be punished if anyone finds out. No worries. This place is supposed to be open for students. We are just putting it to use. It's only natural. Someone is here. Let's hide. You go first. - Thank you. - Sure thing. Mr. Cheong. Watch out. - Ms. Wong? - Where should we put it? Is it heavy? I can manage. Just put it down there. - Okay. - Thank you. - By the way... - Yes? I never thanked you properly. The retirement home that you found for my dad is amazing. I found this job so quickly after I returned to Macau. I'm so grateful for your help. I would never have thought of being a teacher. Thank you again. You shouldn't have. I think you're wasting your talent working here. I don't think so. How is your girlfriend? - It seems they have something. - Well... We broke up a while back. I guess I'm not very good at long-term relationships. Actually, I wanted to say that... It's time. The principal hates people being late. You need to hurry up. Okay, I'll get going. Can you handle these by yourself? No problem. I'll just tidy up a bit. Then I'll go now. Off you go. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Hey! Why are you here? With my teenage girl's instinct, I can tell you two are having something. You're nuts. By the way, did you break into the music room? It's no worse than having an office romance here. Keong, we should report what we saw to the principal. Hey. I will let it pass this time. No. Are you trying to bribe me? Unless you let me continue using the music room. Whatever. Hey! Can you not make so much noise? If you were really focused, you wouldn't be so easily distracted. Or maybe you're just not very good. I don't want to give you a free lesson. I have to go. Where are you going? I am going to the kitchen. The meat will take a while longer before it's done. - Take a seat and wait. - It's not pickled enough. It's too bland. Let me talk to the chef. - Wait. I will talk to the chef. Sit. - No. - Eat. - Let me talk to the chef. - I will talk to the chef. - Let... - Let me in. - I'll do it. Let me handle this. We have extra dishes, Dad. I bought you your favorite roasted pork. Sit down and enjoy your meal. Don't rush. Look. Sleep tight, Dad. Have you washed the bucket, Shing? Yes, I have. You can finish your work now. The truth is, your dad's condition... He is actually doing better than when he first came here. I know. Maybe he's like one of those men in the painting. He doesn't know who he is. He thought I was his employee, but maybe that's not too bad. Even though he doesn't recognize you, what matters most is that he can feel that you care for him. I heard you are a music teacher. The thing is, we are going to have a show here. We are looking for a volunteer singer. I was wondering if you'd be interested... I will pass. I haven't sung for a very long time. What a pity. If you have friends who can sing and might be able to volunteer, please let me know. Sure. I might ask one of my students to sing. What do you think? No problem. "Cheong Chi Ian. He made his debut at 18 years old after he won the interschool singing contest. He released a couple of singles. Then he signed with a record company in Hong Kong and moved there to perform. But things didn't go so well for the past few years and he has been going up and down. So he faded into the background. He was associated with music productions in different places, but he left the business a few years ago. Then he went to Shanghai to study." I don't know. This is what Wikipedia says about him. It's all there. But I was smart enough to check the school website and check out Ms. Wong's profile. I found out she studied in Shanghai too before returning to Macau to teach in the school. So... So they most probably studied in the same college. At least they knew each other then. Then maybe they're old flames. The douchebag must have gotten tired of her and dumped her after graduation. Now, he wants to make up with her. No doubt, these stories are all the same. Here, these are his songs. Take a listen. So tired of lying in this real world I am free to be myself and happy It's nice. My song is filled with wishes Allow me to shout it out clearly Hey, you are in class. Why are you listening to music? I am sorry, Mr. Cheong. Hey. Someone told me you're looking for a gig. Yes, so what? I have a good gig for you. Is that so? What is it about? Singing. Interested or not? Maybe. Where is it? I won't do it in weird places. Retirement home. Is that okay for you? It sounds nice. Is this a paying gig? I knew you'd ask. This is just a booking fee. - Beef Jerky, are you scared? - Thank you, Nathan. - You're nuts. - Do you want to see more? - Stop calling me that. - Next, please welcome Lao lok Fong. - Don't mess up my song. - She will sing an inspirational song. Please welcome her. It's your time. Go. Hi, everyone. My name is lok Fong. I am going to sing a song called "In One Go". Want for my dream, I never back down But there is too much of this and that Lose to cowardice, seek for an antidote Leave, but hear my heart shout What happened in the dream stays the same I want to go my own way I am being asked why I keep dreaming This is called belief Turn back to give up self-control, go all out no matter what Won't be a problem even singing nonsense No one cares what I am singing I am so awful, don't bother to sit down Uncles and aunties are so good They have so many things to do Hey masters You can play chess for your whole lives That was pretty good. You even changed the lyrics a bit. But I don't think the audience was interested. They didn't pay much attention to my song. But did you sing with passion? The audience wasn't obligated to give you applause. If you didn't sing with dedication, why should they focus on you? It's easier said than done. I have to go. Right. What now? Pay me. I told you to concentrate on your studies. Where have you been? Keong wanted to learn guitar, so I gave it to her. Then she said it was hard, so I took it back. Don't lie to me. Your class teacher has told me everything. What's wrong with you? Why are you entering the singing contest? Do you have that much free time? You failed three subjects last semester. You don't want to graduate, do you? Just look at yourself. What can you do in the future? - You'll end up begging on the street. - Enough! I know exactly what I'm doing. Leave me alone! I just want you to live a good life in the future. At least get a decent job. I'm not going to make dinner tonight. Money is on the table. Buy your own food. - San. - Yes? What are you going to do after work? Nothing. Why do you ask? Let's go to the casino. No. It doesn't cost too much. Earn yourself a little shopping money and it's not much even if you lose. No. Let's go. You used to say this to me. Let's go. I'm not going. Let me know if you go next time. Hi, Leo. Let's talk about the coffee. Wait. Are you not awake? Can you try to be a little more alert? I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. By the way, about the coffee... Little girl. Just let him be. This sort of things happen all the time. Don't take it to heart. Just do your job. Everyone. This day of next year, you'll be planning the next stage in your lives. I believe most of you will choose to go to college. So today, I am going to talk to you about your choices to see if I can answer your questions and perhaps give some helpful advice. Everyone, feel free to speak up. Don't worry about your abilities. Just have a little faith in yourselves. Class meeting, Further studies Iok Fong? Can you tell us your plans? I want to study music. I want to be a singer. You can fight so well. How about being a boxer? Don't waste your talent. Shut up, idiot. I'm afraid you'll damage everyone's ears. It's everyone's responsibility to protect the environment. Listen. I will become a singer. I will hold a large concert. Forget it. I'll run naked around the Ruins of Saint Paul's if you become famous. Deal. If I become famous, you will run naked and you will cut... Iok Fong. Cut back on your sarcasm. Hey. Hey. Teach me music. Come to my class on time then. Not like this. I want you to teach me one-on-one. Are you out of your mind? I am sure the principal is interested in office romance... Hey, stop making it up. Mr. Cheong likes... Fine. I'll teach you. You're so scary. Follow me on "Ah." Ah. Ah Ah Ah... Hold on. Can you not sing from your throat? Sing from your diaphragm. I don't get it. When do you learn to sing? Or how do you practice? I've never learned how to sing. I've taught myself since junior high school, then I sing night and day. For example, in karaoke and... - Okay. - I... Don't go to those places from now on. To be honest, your voice is quite good. You have potential. This is your advantage. But you lack professional training. Your singing is all over the place. So what should I do? Take out your phone. Starting tomorrow, record the songs you sing. Analyze any problems in them. What should I sing? Whatever. I have a meeting. Hey. Never mind. Ah Ah To enhance our student's artistic performance, I suggest that we can learn from abroad and organize exchanges between China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Let's start with the nearest spot. We'll take Hong Kong as the first destination. Arrange exchange programs for our students and visit art lessons in other schools. Let's warmly welcome Cheong Chi Ian, a singer from Macau. Ah They don't even pay you, yet you still go to Hong Kong to sign a contract with them. They lied to you. And when all your money is gone, they'll kick your butt back here. Go on. Get lost. Sir, these are the lyrics you wanted me to revise. I have finished them. Take a look. Put it on my desk. I'll take a look when I get back. I know the songs you write are popular, but it will be very hard for my colleagues to arrange. How do you know if you don't even try? Don't take the audience as an idiot. Do as you like. Your songs have to hit the market. Do you understand? Ah From tomorrow onwards, we'll have special practice. Look into the outer space Who is waiting for me outside the cloud I love watching and catching the stars Or love quizzing Who will present me with happiness Set off, explore with my heart I don't fear this adventure My heart will be my guidance With fate, we will meet in the galaxy Will you shine for me? Will you shine, shine for me? Follow you, we will finally meet Will you stay with me? Will you stay, stay with me? Hold me tight, don't say goodbye It's only two months until the contest. From tomorrow onward, after school, besides one-hour basic practice, you'll be giving special performances. Besides field experience, what is more important is to get used to the pressure of performing in front of a crowd. I don't fear this adventure My heart will be my guidance With fate, we will meet in the galaxy Will you shine for me? Will you shine, shine for me? Follow you, we will finally meet Will you stay with me? Will you stay, stay with me? Hold me tight, don't say goodbye Your dad is doing much better now. But his memory is still failing him. There's very little we can do about it. Even if he forgets everything, he still needs my care because I am his son. By the way, I should have told you a long time ago. I'm getting married. This is your invitation to the wedding. Thank you. You will be there, right? Absolutely. I will. Thank you. How about you singing on stage on that day? I'm sure the other guests would love it. You must be kidding. I haven't sung for a long time. How about lok Fong sings? I think she has been making progress recently. Good idea. I should have thought of it. Sure. Why are you laughing? Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing. Why are you looking at me? You look good, douchebag. I thought you would chicken out. Don't say anything stupid. How is your preparation? Today is the big day. Don't embarrass yourself. Rest assured. For both of you, I will do my best. Guests. And now is the most important moment of the night. Let's give a big round of applause to the bride and groom tonight. Let's welcome the newlyweds. Let's applaud. Beef Jerky, are you ready? Not yet. Why don't you sing? Are you kidding? It's not funny. I was just joking. But this guitar is always not tuned well. Let me do it. I just went to the washroom. This newlywed couple is a song composed about love. A special guest tonight will perform this touching love story. Please welcome. I am coughing so bad. It's going to ruin the wedding. What do you want? Are you playing games with me? Hey, you have gone this far. You have the courage to come. Why don't you face it yourself? Hello, everyone. My name is Cheong Chi Ian. I have a song for you. I hope you will like it. Body has been put into the doghouse The clock has stopped rotating In this darkness with no boundary There is no vent hole found in the small room When your gaze overlaps with mine We understand each other The freezing snow Will be melted by the warm winds from the equator Pick a beam of light Allow me to peep at the wish in the dark All the walls in the world Are imitating you and me The light of happiness can be found in the vast universe Accidentally touched the flickering starlight If the never-fading firework still exists in the world Explore it together with me When your gaze overlaps with mine We understand each other The freezing snow Will be melted by the warm winds from the equator Pick a beam of light Allow me to peep at the wish in the dark All the walls in the world Are imitating you and me The light of happiness can be found in the vast universe Accidentally touched the flickering starlight If the never-fading firework still exists in the world Explore it together with me Years ago, the company released my album in Hong Kong. The market response was terrible. And slowly, they arranged for me to support other artists. It's true I have performed in many places. But I felt like I was slowly losing myself. Later, I left the company and went to Shanghai to study. There, I met Wong Hei. In my life, those days were the happiest and most memorable. One year later, the company reached out to me again. They were confident that another album would be successful and that I was going to be famous. I didn't want to give up the opportunity, so I left Shanghai and went back to Hong Kong. You see, it made no difference in the end. So you broke up with her because of this? I think you still care for each other. So what? Get her back. You're crazy. You're too young to understand. You'll see when you grow up. You keep saying that. Can't you say anything else? You're making it up. Mind your own business. Let me tell you. Women are all terrible. You excluded. Boss Hong, this place is very nice. It has nice food and a great environment. It's awesome. Calm down. I already told you guys you should see more of the world. You are right, Boss Hong. But why is lok Fong here? We seem to keep bumping into her recently. Don't mention that shrew again. Let's have a drink. Come on, bottoms up. The boss asked you to drink. Thank you. Are you new here? I've been here a couple of months. You are petite and very pretty. Hey, what are you doing? Sorry, he is drunk. I'm not drunk. Stop acting. You think all she does here is sing? How much are you? Stay with me tonight. Come on. Darn you. Get away from me! Girl, are you messing with me? You splashed water on me? What is it now? I'm sorry, sir. - Please forgive her. - Forgive her? How about I splash on you and ask you to just forgive me? - Please forgive her. - Your girlfriend did this. What now? I'll buy you a drink. What about I splash water on you and buy you drinks? - Are you okay with that? - Calm down. - She hit me. - I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, sir. I apologize to you for her behavior. Who are you, puppy? Drink up first. I'm being splashed. How can I just let it pass? Let's see. Drink up. How can you bully my schoolmate? What the heck are you doing? Is this the Water Festival? What? Do you think I'm scared? You don't need to thank me. I would do the same for any other girl. Congratulations, you have a bright future. - I will beat you up! - I'm not afraid of you! - Come on, beat me! - Hit me! Beat him to death. Come on, let's fight. You're going to graduate next year, and yet you get into this kind of trouble? It's just a little ruckus. Principal, it was us three who were responsible. Don't blame the others. Why are you lying? Principal, I caused this incident. I am responsible. I apologize. - Don't fight me over the apology. - What? - It is true. - Principal, give me the demerit. - Enough. - You had nothing to do with this. Have you ever respected me as your principal? You fought again. Even outside the school this time. It seriously compromised our reputation. Do you know the consequences? Principal, please give them a chance. It's very hard for them to pass the 11th grade. There's only one more year until graduation. Especially lok Fong. She has behaved well lately - and her results improved. - All right. For the sake of Ms. Wong, I will only give each of you a demerit this time. If it happens again, you will most definitely be expelled. Now, go and reflect upon your actions. Okay, you should thank the principal. - Thank you, Principal. - Thank you, Principal. One more thing. You all need to write a 3,000-word essay on repentance. Now, go to class. Mr. Cheong, please stay. Mr. Cheong, I'd like to have your explanation on this. Yes. It was me that had lok Fong sing in the bar. Principal, Mr. Cheong wanted to cultivate student talent. He just rushed to... I have already heard about Lao lok Fong. She is well-known in the school. She performed on our school's anniversary. Mr. Cheong. Just because I understand why you did this doesn't mean you are right. I've been there. Just some advice to a young man like you. As a teacher, being creative is a good thing, but there are lines you must not cross. I am sorry. I don't want this to get out into public. Don't do it again. Of course. I am sorry, miss. I don't really know how to teach her. I don't know why she is getting worse. How many times have I told you? I was just singing. Nothing else. It's a decent part-time job. Will you stop judging with prejudice? Don't get fresh with me. It is the truth. A lot of stars started out as resident singers. You're too old-fashioned. You... You're always daydreaming. How old are you now? You haven't even graduated from high school. You can't even take care of yourself and you're arguing with me. How do you know I can't? I believe I can take care of myself. Iok Fong, please stop it for a minute. Mrs. Lau, please calm down. In fact, lok Fong did this on the spur of the moment. She has already learned her lesson. The principal already gave her a grave warning. She will never do it again. Yes, this time, she... Hey. You're breaking the guitar, big star. Are you going to quit the contest? I am sorry. I acted impulsively and dragged you into this. I never expected you to apologize. Your song. I've finished the lyrics. I hope it will help you win the contest. Thank you. I will win for sure. You're finally smiling. But on one condition. What? Do I need to pay you? Please find the time to study. If you don't graduate because of this contest, your mom will be very sad. Have you ever fallen in love with someone? What? What did you say, Boss? Boss, you don't want a girl like lok Fong. What the heck are you talking about? Did I say I like her? You had it coming. Stop it, Boss. To Beef Jerky, the big star Don't give up and fight back What are you doing, Beef Jerky? It's just an open audition now. No need to make a fuss. This is the battle of superstars. I must make it big. Is it very cool? It's more important to focus on singing. Don't be nervous on the stage. Just sing as usual. Okay, good show. Okay. Wait. I got something to cheer you up. I don't believe it! It's your kind. But after you finish the contest. This is for celebration. Hi, everyone. My name is Lao lok Fong. I am going to sing an original song called "The World of Moron". Remember to be a good girl, accept fate Be ignored ten thousand times Who knows it's like the middle age, the girls lose their names I want to explore the world, to be a girl of pride Wish to change history with my will Willing to accept setbacks, to be myself, I love it What a moron, limitation and rules suck It's hypocritical to say everyone's equal I'm falling, falling, falling down I'm falling, falling, I am used to pressure What a moron, don't complain about how complicated people are Don't give up and fight back I'm falling, falling, falling down I'm falling, falling, have no fear of getting hurt Maybe I mess around, but I am not afraid of death When treated with indifference, I need to believe in myself more Learn how to disclose ruthlessly, understand this world's fallacy What a moron, limitation and rules suck It's hypocritical to say everyone's equal I'm f♪♪♪♪♪♪, f♪♪♪♪♪♪, f♪♪♪♪♪♪ down I'm f♪♪♪♪♪♪, f♪♪♪♪♪♪, I am used to pressure What a moron, don't complain about how complicated people are Don't give up and fight back I'm f♪♪♪♪♪♪, f♪♪♪♪♪♪, f♪♪♪♪♪♪ down I'm f♪♪♪♪♪♪, f♪♪♪♪♪♪, I am used to pressure Well, what an expressive vocabulary! She has a lot of guts to sing such a profane song. But I think it's an interesting piece. This time, I really wish your explanation could convince me. Principal. I wrote the lyrics of this song. I recommended lok Fong to join this contest, so I'm the one to blame. I don't think there is a problem. Music creation should be free. And I didn't sing in school. Principal. I am willing to undertake any disciplinary punishment. Mr. Cheong, do you really want to do this? Remember what I told you last time? I remember. It is really my fault. Miss Lao lok Fong. You swore most profanely in public and gravely compromised the school's reputation. You will have a demerit. In consideration of your previous behavior and conduct, you will be suspended from the school immediately. The school council will decide if you should be expelled. Mr. Cheong Chi Ian. You have violated the school teaching staff's code of conduct again. Acting as the principal of the school, I declare that you are no longer fit to teach in our school. Please pursue another career. I understand. I don't really understand. Stop acting like a hero. I will take responsibility. I rewrote and sang the song. You didn't need to take the blame. Anyway, we didn't do anything wrong. This isn't the school. A lot of singers perform profane songs. The principal doesn't understand music. He's too conservative. Only you understand all this, do you? Have you ever thought about why you were eliminated by the judges? It's because you never think about the consequences. You keep saying freedom of creation. It is a fancy reason, but you're still a student after all. And now, you might be kicked out of school. The principal has gone easy on you. You should reflect on yourself. And if you apologize sincerely to the principal, you may avoid being expelled. Being a teacher is never my long-term plan. I'll leave sooner or later, so I'll take all responsibility. You don't need to sacrifice your career to help me. I never cared about graduating. It's not worth studying in this kind of school. Can you please stop being so headstrong? Think of your mom. If you got kicked out of school... Yes, I am headstrong. You're always right. I'm always wrong! It is my fault that I didn't teach you well. But that all comes to an end today. Take care of yourself. You're finally home? I am talking to you! Do you want to drive me crazy? I told you to stay out of trouble and study. Have you ever listened? How can I worry less about you? Enough! Yes. I am useless. I am trash to you! But what right do you have to scold me? All you do is gamble. Dad left because of you. Since I was little, only he has ever loved me. And you? All you do is scold me. Have you ever cared how I have felt? Do you know what I want? Do you know how to be a mother? Satay Beef Jerky Beef Jerky Hey. I don't get it. Even the person dearest to me doesn't support me. Do you know why? It's because you are stubborn. You always think that people look down on you, that they disagree with you, that even your own mom doesn't understand you. Right? I used to be like that, like you. My dad never liked me being a musician. But I ignored him. I even went to Hong Kong to look for more opportunities. There was a while I had a very bad relationship with my dad. Every year, I'd come back to Macau for work. But I didn't want to go home. So we didn't see each other very often. My mom was stuck in the middle. She didn't even let me know that she was ill. She didn't want me to worry. When she passed away, I was on tour in China. I never knew until I got back. Since then, my dad has been treating me like an enemy. But it doesn't matter anymore. He can't even remember who I am now. I was too selfish. Now, it's an opportunity for me to make amends a bit. So I don't want you to be like me. Do you understand? Come here and grab something to eat. Okay. When you go home, talk to your mom. Can you do that? Okay. Don't be like me. Or you'll never get married. All right. Douchebag. You know very well how difficult you are, Beef Jerky. Have some sausages. Hello. Are you Miss Lao lok Fong? Hello. I am the Artist Director of Starlight Record Company. My name is David. How can I help you? Didn't you know that the swearing song you sang went viral online? You're really something. You dare to sing swear words out loud. You even ignore your school's suppression. Many netizens supported you. You are called the Goddess of Rebellion. What? The Starlight Record Company would like to invite you to join our family. We would like to sign with you to be our singer. Principal, I am begging you. Give lok Fong a chance. Please don't kick her out of school. She is not a bad person in nature. It's my responsibility. I overlooked my daughter because I am too busy at work. Principal, please. Give lok Fong a chance. Principal. Our company will provide singers with necessary protection. Bonuses are guaranteed for any job in addition to 10,000 up basic salary. The most important thing is that we have the most professional planning team and top talents in the industry. With your popularity online and our best promotion, I can guarantee, Miss Lao lok Fong, you're going to be a sensation. I first saw you when you sang in the club. Since that time, I have thought, "This girl is going to make it." My mom will surely be against me if I drop out of school now. She insists on me graduating. Iok Fong, you know what? This is an opportunity that many singers have been waiting for for decades. Do they not have potential? They do. If you don't seize the opportunity when it comes to you, you may regret it for the rest of your life. And you're already suspended from school. You can go back to school in the future, but opportunity only knocks once. The audience is very fickle and no one will remember you this time next year. I am not here to help you. I just don't want to see a rising star miss her chance. Wise choice. Good. The first contest you will be in is Macau Megastar Singing Contest. You will stay with the company before the contest. We will help you prepare. Apologize. Apologize for beating her up. I am sorry. Cut! Well done! Everyone is doing a great job. Hello, everybody. I am Hou Dee. Have you guys heard of the Goddess of Rebellion recently? You are right, this is her, lok Fong. I guess she's more popular than I am now. - Shut up. - Hey! Goddess of Rebellion saves beauty from a violent man It's none of your business. Why are you beating her up? Who are you? I'll beat you too. Fine. Do it if you have the guts. Everyone here is videotaping you. Uses crowd pressure to stop the violent man Apologize. Apologize for beating her up. I am sorry. "Goddess of Rebellion saves beauty from a violent man." Worth hitting the Like, right? By the way, I think you are very brave. I will never stay silent in the face of injustice. That's cool. Just like your original song in the contest. It was written to criticize injustices in the school, right? Because they blindly decide what's right and wrong based on their rules. They don't really see the truth behind things. Yes, it's most important to look at things from more angles. Quite a personality, with your own ideas. From what I have heard, you are going to participate in the Macau Megastar Singing Contest. Right? - By the way, what is the inspiration - I will support her. - She's really amazing. - Behind this song? Sources claim that Lao lok Fong will join a Macau singing contest. She is going to sing the swearing song uncensored in the contest. Will the school expel her or not? Although she has been suspended from the school, she is still our student. The school rules on conduct are still binding for her. The school council will consider all aspects of this case. And I believe they will come to the right decision in the end. Iok Fong. I know you must be here. Why don't you answer my call? I already know what you are going to say anyway. Forget about it. Do you know that your mom keeps pleading with the school for you? The school is really considering expelling you. Don't push me with my mom and school. I know what I am doing. Do you really know what you're doing? You go on singing that song and you'll never go back to school. If that's true, then it's out of my hands. I saw your interview online. I am now asking you as a friend instead of your teacher. What is this Goddess of Rebellion? Do you know what you are doing? I have decided to participate in the contest. Being a singer is always my goal. I will regret it for the rest of my life if I miss this opportunity. My goodness, hey. Aren't you Cheong... Cheong Chi Ian? It has been a while. I used to listen to your songs. But it seems you have changed your career. I am telling you. Iok Fong has huge potential. This is a talent worthy of training. Is it your decision to follow this guy? Iok Fong. We have a tight schedule today. Let's go. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, our long-awaited Macau Megastar Singing Contest now begins. How are the settings, director? Thank you. Hey, Hou Dee. Hey, David. What's up? I just want to say it's all thanks to you last time. Do you know that we have more than two million views? It's nice to have a good response. Speaking of which, I hope it means you'll be settling the payment soon. No problem. That's why I am calling you. I will make the bank transfer tomorrow. We will have many opportunities to work together in the future. Let's make a big success. Thank you in advance. By the way, have you bribed the judges? Bribing the judges? Is it necessary? It won't work. It doesn't matter whether she wins or loses. The most important thing is that after tonight, the audience's attention will be on this girl. Who cares who the champion will be? Nurse, have you seen my dad? No. Chi Yan, Wa isn't here? He said his son will be in the singing contest. He decided to go to the live performance. Did he really sneak out? Birth of Superstars You let me in. - No, you cannot come in. - I am going in. - You cannot go in. - I am going in. - You can't. - I am going in. - Let me in. - Hang on, I know him. Mr. Wa, why are you here? Do you remember me? I'm a student of Cheong Chi Ian. Why are you here? I am looking for Chi Yan to record him. He is not here. You should go back to the retirement home. No, he is here. You cannot go in. I recorded his performance before. Let me in. Listen, you can't go in there. What is going on? It's time for your rehearsal. I want to record him. I'll do it for you, okay? Can you take him to the reception room and call this number? Let the nursing home take him back. - Okay. - Thank you. I'll help you record. This way. This way. Remember, the music needs to match with the lights. The security has to be arranged well. Okay, understood. - This is correct. - I am sorry. The contest begins at 7 p.m. You must come back no later than 6:30 p.m., okay? Have you seen my dad? Yes, he should be in the reception room. I'll take you there. Excuse me, where is the old man just now? I saw him sitting there. But now? I don't know. You don't know? Didn't you help me make the phone call? I am very busy. I don't have time to look after him. - What's wrong with you? - I... Shouldn't you let me know immediately when my dad is here? Hello. I am. Is he all right? Okay, I'll be right there. He is in the hospital. - I'll be back soon. - What? Hey, where are you going? How is Mr. Wa? He is fine now. He was hit by a trolley. Why was he running around? What happened? He said he wanted to watch your performance. What? I told him to find you, but he kept saying he recorded your show before and you must be there. - And I don't know he... - You know his condition. You know that. I know. So I had someone take him to the reception room and call retirement home. What is wrong with you? You left him alone. Have you thought about the consequences? - Okay. - So... Go back. I am sorry. Just go. No matter what you are doing, come back right now. Okay. Nine missed calls - I am sorry. - No need to explain. Sit. Iok Fong. I am your manager after all. Can you show some respect? Don't play games with me, okay? Fine. It's fine. Forget about everything. Don't let it spoil your mood. Break a leg. Have a good show. Put on this costume. The contest begins soon. Hi, everyone. My name is Cheong Chi Ian. Today, I am going to sing my original song. I sing to remember this moment and in the meantime, I hope my future self will keep making music. The song is called "High Sky and Deep Sea". Music can travel through time. No matter how long and how far our memories are long forgotten, music will reemerge the old feelings. Tonight, we have 15 contestants with this kind of power to bring every one of you into the world of music. Here, tonight, you can indulge yourselves at the 17th Macau Megastar Singing Contest. Thank you very much. This is my first performance here. It may also be my last. Because I don't know if I will be back here after graduation. Lao lok Fong, it's your turn. I know I am headstrong. Because of that, I have made many mistakes. But at this moment, I want to be headstrong one final time. So tired of lying in this world I am free to be myself and happy My song is filled with wishes Allow me to shout it out clearly I believe I have a pair of unique hands Rejecting to be a puppet Small potato has the power to walk out Brave to go out and join the combat Don't care how high the sky will be I can spread my wings and fly high Fight against destiny I know how many times I have given up I fear that I will have to mourn one day Let me keep going bravely And I will get there I sing as loudly as I can I don't fear to lose the battle I am stronger than the thunderstorm The song is filled With my undying determination Don't care how high the sky will be I can spread my wings and fly high Fight against destiny My faith is with me on the expedition Confidence can blaze the trail For my dream, I can do it Don't care how deep the sea will be I can submerge into the bottom No matter how dark it is I have made up my mind to sacrifice Will keep forging ahead no matter the pain It's my best times Fear not the ups and downs It's always fine without any recognition I still don't regret, don't regret Don't care how deep the sea will be I can submerge into the bottom No matter how dark it is I have made up my mind to sacrifice Will keep forging ahead no matter the pain It's my best times Fear not the ups and downs - Don't care how high the sky will be - Don't care how high the sky will be - I can spread my wings and fly high - I can spread my wings and fly high - Fight against destiny - Fight against destiny - My faith is with me on the expedition - My faith is with me on the expedition - Confidence can blaze the trail - Confidence can blaze the trail - For my dream, I can do it - For my dream, I can do it Don't care how deep the sea will be I can submerge into the bottom No matter how dark it is I have made up my mind to sacrifice Will keep forging ahead no matter the pain - It's my best times - It's my best times - Fear not the ups and downs - Fear not the ups and downs Thank you very much. This is my first performance here. It may also be my last. I must thank those who support me all the way. Thank you, my dad and mom. They are not here today, but I believe that one day, they will attend my own concert and listen to my songs. No matter how high the sky or how deep the sea will be, I will keep fighting for my dream. You are tired. Go back and get some rest. I am not tired. By the way, Shing. Don't be late for work again tomorrow. Yes, Dad. Come on, eat something first. Silly girl, what are you crying for? Don't cry. You look ugly when you cry. Iok Fong, you were amazing. I know you sang better than anyone else. Yes, I think so. You were better than the winner. It was pretty nice. You performed quite well. The song was nice. I remember what someone said. If I get famous, someone is going to get cut. That's right, Boss. - Cut him. - Cut him. - Cut him. - Come on, Boss. - Wait, hold on. - Cut him. - Cut him. - Come on. - Cut him. - Cut him. - Don't move. - Cut him. Student. You'll be punished for entering the music room without permission. Why are you here? What else can it be? I came to get my salary. Okay. You sang very well that day. Did you watch my performance? You could improve so much in a short time. You were really something. But I am still much better than you, so you didn't win the contest. It didn't matter. Winning or losing is not so important to me. I was happy to sing there anyway. I am destined to be a star in the future. The judges had no taste. Do you have any plans for the future? Me? I thought about opening a musical instrument store to nurture talents. Think about it. Many people dream to be a pop star. I could even fix you, a Beef Jerky. I'm going to be rich. Stop daydreaming. How about being a singer again? Will you write songs for me? Sure, I'll write you one now. What do you want me to write about? Something without too many swear words. No way. All the words I know are swear words. If so, then we start at B flat, minor 7, flat 5. Don't make things complicated. Be simple, okay? That is C, right?
