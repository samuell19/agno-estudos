I really think this is gonna get me promoted from junior to brand. Yeah, that's amazing, babe. It's amazing. Congrats. Hm. Thank you. Hey, can we get one of your sticky toffee figgy puddings, please? Yeah? Thank you. So, what do you think? I think the figgy pudding here is beyond. And I'm so glad it's my cheat day. No, I mean, about my pitch, for the ad. Ah, yeah. No, it's, um, cool, I guess. I just don't know how someone can label somebody else as nice or naughty when they don't really even know them yet. You don't just swipe them naughty or nice right off the bat, that's not how the new interface is gonna work, you still wanna swipe if you're a good match or not, and then you get time to get to know them, at that point, you could choose which category they fit into. Nice or naughty. Here. I'm gonna show you. This is the new interface, you see a mistletoe. ‐How cute is that? Hm? ‐Um‐hmm. And then at the bottom, naughty‐verses‐nice buttons. You know what, let me just see if there's anyone on the app around here. Oh, I think we're good. I think we've seen it. I think may‐‐ No, 'cause then I can show you how it works. Ah... Ooh... ‐Rod? ‐Yup? Please tell me that this is a catfish Rod or a doppelganger, or evil twin I don't know about. I... I don't... I just... Come on, Chelsea, you're kind of on the app, too. Isn't everybody these days? It's my company app. I don't use the app to date. Here, "Just for friends." "Dating a few people?" Oh, you know what, maybe I just got on the app to see what it's all about, so I could get to know you, get to know your work better and stuff like that. You're unbelievable, you know that? Chelsea, come on! I'm serious about you. About us. I just don't know if I can see only you. I think you're a selfish immature child and... Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to think about this. ‐So I'm gonna go now. ‐Chelsea, stay. ‐ Come on! ‐Mm, I'm not gonna stay. Chelsea, come on! I can't cheat this many calories alone, babe! Not even on my cheat day. Right here. Thank you. And thank you for all the tissue. ‐Chels! Hey! ‐Hey, Fisher! Wow, yard's looking good. Ah, thanks. I was just, uh, doing a little pre‐gamin'. ‐Gettin' my decorations up. ‐Wow! Still got to put the lights tonight. Wow, you're still way ahead of us. Keegan promised we'd do it this weekend, but now she's taken on the task of throwing the holiday party, so she is busy freaking out about that. And I'm sure someone is already doing damage control? Always working hard to earn my spot on Santa's nice list. How are things going with the app? Oh, things are going great for Rod since he's made himself a profile. ‐You're serious? ‐Yeah. Aw, Chels, I'm sorry. You know I never really liked that guy. Yeah. You feel like talking about it? No. I'll be fine. I'll tell you what, why don't you get some comfy clothes on, come out here and get in the holiday spirit and help me put some lights up on these houses? ‐What do you say? ‐Oh, I would love to. But I have to finish my pitch for tomorrow. Okay. I'll let you go then. Uh, but let me know if you need anything. Will do. Bye, Fish. And break a leg on that big meeting! Get it? I'm good! Oh, Chelsea, perfect timing. Here. ‐I need your photo expertise. ‐Oh, wow. Keegan, this is all for the party? Yes, it is, but I'm... ‐I'm totally lost right now. ‐Mm‐hmm. I'm creating a backdrop so we can come out with a cute invite for social media, but the party still needs a theme. Can you help? This is the kind of stuff you're good at. Babe, isn't the theme just love? Oh. How about, All I Want For Christmas Is Dot, Dot, Dot, To Be On The Good List? ‐I love it! Yeah, it's great. ‐It's, it's genius. ‐It's so good. And you did it. ‐It's so good. Yeah! ‐Awesome, I love it. ‐Okay. You see, great. So all we need to do is come up with some killer backdrop for this invitation. Keegan, I am sorry. I wanna stay and help you, but I have to finish the actual pitch for the launch tomorrow. No, no, no, Chelsea, please. ‐Just, just for a little bit. ‐I can't. ‐Please! ‐Oh, don't do that face. I mean, you're the one that got me into throwing this launch party. You begged for this job. You begged, you begged me‐‐ I just, I just wanted to prove to Zane that I'm not some silver‐spoon trust‐fund girl by throwing a killer party for your company. Come on, I don't know what I'm doing here. Please, just pretty please, please, just for a little bit. ‐Please! Okay. ‐Okay. Okay. ‐Okay. Okay. Yes. ‐Okay. Yes, yes, okay. ‐Okay. ‐Ooh. How about we start by taking all of this into the garage? Yes? Mm. We? Oh. Come on, you take really great photos of me all the time on my FaceFun stories. You have a photox eye. ‐Thank you. ‐Mm‐hmm. Oh. I think that's our invitation. Ooh, wait. One for my FaceFun story. You put our tree of lights up! Well, how would you have felt if you had to come home from your big promotion tomorrow and see my place looking like absolute Christmas perfection while yours sits here sadly in the dark? I love it! Come in. I'll make a cider. I want to run my pitch by you anyway. ‐Okay. To Fisher's impeccable lights, his tech‐savvy ways and all your help with my holiday interface. ‐And your brand promotion. ‐Oh, yes. Really, it's top notch. You don't think Mrs. Kringle's a little dated for young people? Not the way you have her styled here. Besides, she's Mrs. Kringles, she's timeless. Right? And that interface though... Oh. I actually am happy with how it turned out. Now, really, who doesn't want Santa's job of getting to choose who's naughty or nice around the holidays? Oh. I love that. That's a good line. ‐You can have it free of charge. ‐Thank you. I still don't know what Blythe is gonna come up with for her pitch though, so I'm very nervous. Whatever she chooses, it's not gonna be near as good as you. Like, you got this. I'm telling you, you got it all wrapped up in Santa's big bag. You know that, right? I honestly could not have done it without your help. Even one of the tech guys at work said so. Ah. It's nothin'. ‐'Tis the season of giving. Have you decided what you're doing for the holidays yet? Oh, yeah, mom and dad have decided they're gonna do their annual Christmas‐feasts‐ from‐around‐the‐world party. It's gonna be a lot of foreign fun. Sounds internationally interesting. I'm an excited expatriate. That sounds far more fabulous than my family's annual Christmas in the Caribbean. ‐Oh, again? ‐Yeah. Why? I can't tell you how much I miss snowy, white Christmases back home in Colorado. Are you gonna join them again this year? Yeah. Flying out, Christmas Eve. I'm just terrified I'm gonna miss the magic of Christmas. ‐You know? ‐Ah, but you're Chelsea Simms. You're gonna have Christmas with you wherever you go. Around the clock, I'm telling you. Well, I hope that the seasonal spirit shines through to tomorrow. Yeah, by the magic of Mrs. Kringle. And it is here on our oh‐so‐whimsical holiday interface that we get to choose whether or not we make our match naughty or nice. The chatting window is still 48 hours. Now, if after that you choose naughty, then the user is removed from your matches. And if you choose nice... Her interface looks a lot like yours. It's exactly like mine. And here is our ad banner, which, I'm sure, the agency can help bring to life, so we can watch our hunky Santa spread Christmas cheer. I like it. It's strong. Thank you. Chelsea? Hi... I, um... It would appear that Blythe and I have come up with similar concepts. Um... I would say very similar. Did either of you discuss your pitch with one another? Unh‐unh. Okay, well, we did discuss that a naughty, nice twist could be a cute holiday concept for our app, but this seems to be a bit more than just a coincidence. I hope we don't discover that one of you borrowed the other's pitch. Simone, I would never do something like that. ‐Neither would I. ‐Chelsea, your ad banner? Mrs. Claus. Chelsea, Blythe, can I see you both in my office, please? So I'm going to assume that this was just an accident. Have a seat. That being said, Blythe, since you've been here two years longer than Chelsea, I'm gonna let you take lead on this with Chelsea as your junior on the campaign. Thank you so much, Simone. I promise you, I will not let you down. Okay, but just one thing, um... Does that mean that I am promoted to brand? If you can prove that you can handle the job... ‐Yes. ‐ Great. Uh, oh, just one more thing, though, um, with that being said, does, doesn't it make more sense for Judy to come along as my junior? I mean, technically, she's my assistant and she already knows the ins and outs‐‐ Blythe, Chelsea's pitch had a more detail design... and a fully‐realized appeal. You should feel lucky to have her on your team. Thank you. So, Blythe, where did you come up with your interface? Because my neighbor friend, who's a software genius, he had to help me with mine, and it was not an easy component to add into the app. But my husband, he helped me with it. I thought you said your husband was a yoga instructor. With a degree in computer science. Blythe, I really think you stole my idea, and it was an idea that I worked really hard to put together. I mean, I've been working on it for the past two weeks straight. Chelsea, I cannot believe that you would think I would do something so awful. I mean, after working together for almost a year? Come on. You cannot tell me that our ideas being that similar is just a coincidence. You know, they say, "Great minds think alike." Or maybe you just took her idea. Or maybe she just took Blythe's. Hey, we still need to talk about our brand strategy on this. I can't believe it. Can you believe that she thinks I took her idea? Like, it was so insanely innovative in the first place. Oh? I thought it was. ‐You did? Aww, thanks. ‐Yeah. ‐Yeah, of course. I love you. ‐I love you. Hm. This was supposed to be mine. Keegan, what is going on? Oh, I'm so glad you're home. ‐We really need your help. ‐What? ‐Yeah, Zane and I were... ‐Oh... Yeah, having a Santa's cookies‐and‐pajamas party, and we actually burnt the cookies. Yeah, I mean, these wouldn't even come off with a spatula. ‐Chelsea's a good baker. ‐Oh, no. No, no, no, no. ‐She can make a good batch. No, no, no, no, no, no. I love you, but I had the worst day, so I'm gonna go upstairs. I love you, I love you. ‐I love you. I'm going upstairs. ‐Mm. ♪ Pretty please ♪ ‐One batch, that's it. ‐Yes! ‐Whoa! Yes! Yeah! ‐Whoo! As long as you promise no more singing. ‐Now go get changed. ‐No, I can wear this. ‐No, you cannot. Oh, no, you cannot. ‐ Oh... ‐Mm! These are perfect. Chelsea, you crushed it! ‐Mm, yeah, well... ‐Thank you. Careful, the pan is hot. Oh, now, can you take a picture of me and Zane with our sugar‐cookie masterpiece? I can. Okay. Say, "Let it snow." ‐Let it snow. Merry Christmas! ‐Let it snow. ‐Oh! Oh, Fisher! Hey! Thank you so much for putting lights on the house. You are the sugar on my cookie pan. Yes, please. ‐Mm! ‐ Good? Nice, uh, sartorial choice here. They made me do this. Something about, "Santa won't come if you bake in your business casual," I don't know. It's a Southern thing. You know I have heard that. Anyway, uh, your text said your kitchen was indisposed, so I brought holiday rations. Turkey, cranberry dressing sandwiches from Canterbury's? ‐Mm‐hmm. ‐ Thank you. How else could it be so similar? That's what I can't figure out. She must have stolen it somehow. I mean, that is the only explanation. They were exactly the same. What are you gonna do? Unless I can prove that she took my idea, there's nothing I can do. That doesn't sound like the Chelsea I know. There's nothing I can do, except prove that I, and I alone, can launch this holiday ad campaign up to the tree toppers. That's the Simms holiday spirit we like to see! And I'm gonna need your help, probably now more than ever. Fisher Dougherty at your service. And thanks for the sandwiches. This was so nice. Not as nice as you helping Keegan and Zane with their sugar‐cookie catastrophe. Have you talked to Rod? No. He's texted me a lot, though. He needs this gift I have for his aunt. Why do you have his aunt's gift? Because he picked her name in his family's Secret Santa and he asked me if I could get her a gift. He couldn't get her a gift himself? He said he doesn't know what women want. Clearly. You know, between Keegan bombarding your home life, Blythe stealing your thunder at work and Rod taking whatever's left, it's a wonder you have anything left to give. I know. I know. Sometimes I wish the world wasn't such a selfish place. Well, not everyone out there is so selfish. Okay, Mr. Optimistic. This coming from the same guy who has sworn off love, who won't even try the good list because he says people's profiles are, how did you put it, "Better‐scripted versions of themselves." Hey, I did not swear off love and I don't judge. I'm just making an observation. Altered self‐perception is a real thing. And I'm not saying everyone's guilty of it, but how will I know? ‐ Do you smell that? ‐What? Yeah, that's the smell of your fear. What, you're the worst. You're afraid of falling in love. You're afraid of getting hurt. That's silly. You have nothing to worry about. Well, I am fine right here. Oh, really? Right here? All alone, just looking up at the stars, hoping some silly girl will fall from the sky. ‐Exactly. Some silly, perfect, giving girl will do just fine. Well, I hope the perfect Mrs. Kringle falls from the sky 'cause Santa knows I need a miracle this Christmas. Shooting star! Maybe it's a good sign. If that's what it is, I'll take it. Fish, you really need a new bag. Oh, I know. It plagues me, I promise. But usually I'm working from home. Okay, so... let's swipe Chelsea as a friend here... ‐And there you go. ‐ That's amazing, Fish. I can't wait to show this to Simone. Can't wait to show what to Simone? Right. Blythe. Uh, this is Fisher who's helping me with the app. Fish, this is Blythe. Yeah. Apparently, we think alike. Aww! Well, lovely to meet you. So, what are we workin' on here? So I'm kind of facilitating this whole new brand campaign, so any new app developments go through me. Yeah, of course. We'll‐we'll show you what we're working on. Okay, so here's how the naughty dialogue box works. So you can see it from this side, too. And all the feedback is anonymous with the matches all disappearing after 48 hours. Same deal, only no contact. Well, this is so much fun, right? Let's get the techs on the upgrade as soon as possible. Good job. ‐Oh, thank you. ‐Thank you. Yeah, thank you so much. Blythe, why don't you take the lead with the text? Chelsea, I need that ad banner like yesterday. ‐Is the studio booked? ‐Yes, it's booked for tomorrow. ‐Great. So we have Ms. Kringle. ‐We are casting today. I can't wait to meet her. Oh, yeah. Can't wait to show her to you. Hi there. Can I help you? Why, yes. Hi. I'm looking for Chelsea. Chelsea? Ha‐ha! Hi. I'm Chelsea. Are you... Your Mrs. Kringle. But you can call me Kay. Well, you perfectly look the part, Kay. I just... Did we contact you already or how did we find you? No, actually, dear, I came to find you. Well, you sure sold me a Mrs. Old Saint Nick, Chels. Yeah, good job. In fact, I even brought my big book with my list of who's been naughty... and who's been nice. That's amazing. Yes. The job is yours. Absolutely. Thank you so much for being here. No, no, no, no, no. Please, thank you. You had no idea. I never get to leave the North Pole. Okay. Let's not waste any time. We should set up a fitting. We'll take you to get a fitting. You know, actually, I think it would be great if we started‐‐ That would be lovely. You know, I'm all yours. You kind of remind me of me when I was your age. You have to go home at some point. What are you still doing here? I was with the techs, they needed a little guidance with the interface, plus, I heard there was strawberry‐chocolate cheesecake. ‐You heard right. There is. ‐Ah. Mm. And this cheesecake is giving me new New Year's resolutions. Agreed. Eat more cheesecake. Speaking of New Year's, I was, uh, thinking, maybe we should just go all out and go to one of those ridiculously‐overpriced rooftop dinner things. Huh? ‐What do you think? ‐Yeah. ‐I think that sounds really fun. ‐Sweet. Only, um, I should check with Rod because we're still in limbo and we had had Santa Barbara New Year's plans, so... Cool. Yeah, cool, cool. That's, uh... All good. Just a thought. I wanted to thank you for today and all your hard work. I know I've said this countless times, but I could not have done this without you. It's my pleasure. And you should let me pay you for your time. No. No. Listen... ‐You already paid me in cake. ‐That's true. Well, what if I take you dancing? Sorry, what? What? I know you didn't just say dancing. ‐ No. No. Yes. You have no choice. Fine. ♪ Time to deck the halls... ♪ Oh, the Carlton? ♪ I give you my heart ♪ ♪ Love don't cost a thing ♪ ♪ It's Christmas ♪ ♪ Come clo‐o‐ose ♪ ♪ Got some mistletoe‐o‐o‐o ♪ ♪ If you'll keep me warm my love don't cost a thing ♪ ♪ Let's give it all this Christmas ♪ Keegan? What's wrong? Zane. We broke up. ‐Again? What happened this time? I asked if he could get me some recording time at the studio on his day off, and he said that I'm always asking for stuff, and, and that I'm too needy. I mean, me, needy? That's just ridiculous! Am I needy? No, I'm not needy. No. I can't believe he said that. I know, right? Well, should we find a new venue for the launch party? No. He said we could still have it there. But I joined your app, so I can find myself a new date for the party. I'll show him needy. ‐Can I get you anything? ‐No. I am perfectly perfect because I am not needy at all. ‐Okay. I love you. ‐Okay. ‐Rod? Hi. ‐ Hey, Chels. Hi. Rod, I thought I told you I needed time to think. Oh, yeah. That, no. It's all good. In fact, I think you were right that we ended it. ‐Uh, I'm sorry, come again? ‐Well... You said I was an immature child who didn't treat you right. I didn't mean we should end it. I just thought we should take time... Time to figure everything out. No, I got it. Take all the time you need. I mean, seriously, I'm fine. ‐Oh. You're fine. ‐I'm fine. Hey, I actually just dropped by for my auntie's gift, if you don't mind. Hope it's good. ‐Oh, Max, I'm sorry I'm late. ‐All good. Mrs. Kringle's getting in a wardrobe right now. She's already been through hair and makeup? We're sending her in for final touches after this. Oh, my goodness, you're amazing. I love you. You look amazing, the set looks amazing. And you look divine, Mrs. Kringle. Oh, well, thank you, Chelsea, especially since I hardly got any sleep at all last night. Really? Same here. That's what these are for. I got you one. I must have had a premonition. Oh, thank you. Okay, then. So, uh, shall we have a shoot? Yes, let's. So, why didn't you get any sleep last night? Oh, my roommate's going through a bit of a breakup and wouldn't stop going on about it. She's needy sometimes. Yeah, well, it's nice that you could be there for her, you know, when she's down. Yeah, I guess. Why were you up so late? Would you believe? My husband, Chris, is a worried mess. I could not get him to let me get off of FaceTime. Yeah, he just gets terrified every time I have to travel alone. Oh, that is so sweet. I wish I had someone in my life who was that concerned for my whereabouts. Seems to me you already do. I'm sorry? Oh, never mind, dear. Uh, you were saying... Oh, yeah, I was just saying it must be nice to have so much love in your life. My boyfriend showed up this morning to inform me that he is moving on. Oh, sounds to me like you dodged a falling icicle. You're probably right. I was hoping that we would work through it, but all of a sudden, now I feel like I'm sick of being used. Even here at work, I feel like I'm all give and no take. Oh, so colleague complications as well? If you call someone stealing my ad pitch a complication, then, yeah. Well, that's just awful. And how did that happen? I guess I let it happen. I guess I must be too nice for my own good. Always on the good list, eh? Yeah. And sometimes, it feels like I'm all alone. And I want everyone to be on the good list. I mean, that would make Christmas perfect. You're really easy to talk to. Something about you just has all this truth pour out of me. Well, maybe because I haven't always been on the good list myself. I don't believe you. Really? Hm. Oh, please. Yeah, yes. But, you know, it's just as easy to get back on the good list as it is to find yourself on the naughty list, right? Oh, believe me, I should know. I've watched it play out on the pages of our book for centuries. Oh. Heh. You, you're really good. Method, I love that. ‐Where did we find you? ‐Just lucky, I guess. Sorry. Santa's eyes only. But how, how did you... Oh, just a little Christmas magic. Yeah, that's perfect. Just open it up, pretend it's your personal good list. ‐It'll match the brand. Yes! Oh, yes! Yes! I love it. That's perfect. I think... I think we got it. Yeah. Awesome. Everyone, that's a wrap. You really had me convinced on those last few with the book. This ad is gonna be so great for the good list. Thank you. Oh, and maybe for the naughty list, too. Oh? Well, if people learn their lessons. Well, you know what we do at the North Pole when someone has been nice? ‐Santa gives them a gift? ‐Exactly. And you know what we do when they've been naughty? What's that? Well, we write their name down in the book on the naughty list, and then we write out a separate little life‐lesson experience so they can learn how to be nice again. Sounds genius. Does that always work? Oh, well, you know, it's always up to them to decide if they wanna learn from the lesson, but never hurts to try, you know? If only our app was like your book. There are a few people on my naughty list right now. Well, who says it won't be. I don't know, you may find out sooner than you think that it takes on a life of its own. Huh? Well, you did ask for a little extra help at Christmas this year, didn't you? Just remember what it's for. I wish Rod would see how great I am. By day, I'm a physical therapist and a masseur. On the side, I am a private ladies Pilates instructor. Uh, um, which is actually how I met my girlfriend Chelsea who is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Ugh! Did I do something wrong? I did everything wrong. Chelsea. Chelsea, you better get down here. There's someone here to see you. Coming! ‐Chelsea, hi. ‐Hi. Oh, my goodness, it's, it's so good to see you. I'm sorry? I got you a wreath of roses. What? Rod, thank you. They're beautiful. Uh, is everything okay? Yes. Yes, everything's great. I just wanted to apologize for the way that I've treated you in the past, and I promise that from here on out I'm gonna treat you the best that I can, treat you the way that you deserve to be treated. All right, let me take you out tomorrow night. We can got to dinner anywhere you want. Okay. Yeah. That sounds... That sounds really nice. Great. Man, you are so beautiful. It's like I've never seen you this beautiful before. In fact, it's like I've never seen you at all before. It's good to see you, Chels. It's good to really see you. He sees me now? He sees me? And suddenly, he is in my home this morning doing exactly what I wrote into the app for him to do last night. And you think he came back because of the naughty list? Oh, he didn't just come back, Fisher. He came back with a vengeance. He had a nice sweater on and a rose wreath, and he had all the right words. And trust me, Rod never had the right words. Like, ever. I mean, it was like he became the boyfriend I always wanted him to be. Okay, so let me get this straight, it was Mrs. Kringle who enchanted your phone, so then you could enchant him, is that right? Fisher, I know I sound crazy, but I'm not crazy, okay? I never said you were crazy. When have you known me to say anything so absurd? ‐Well, never. ‐Exactly! But you've had a very stressful week, so... ‐I'm just saying. You're making me very frustrated. Show me your phone. See, look. I said, "I wish Rod could see how great I am." ‐Ah. ‐And that's what he kept saying. How he could see me. I mean, that... That can't be just a coincidence. Okay, so maybe I download the app, you swipe me naughty, and give me a good‐list lesson and we see what happens. No. Fisher, I am freaking out right now. ‐Can't you see that? ‐I can see that. I am trying to tell you that my phone lit up like a Christmas tree when Mrs. Kringle looked at it. Just like this old book that she was holding. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, do you still have the ability to contact her? Yeah. I'm sure we have it somewhere at the office. I mean, we found her through this casting agency we use, I thought, but I don't remember seeing her in any of the submissions. And‐and she came in before we had a chance to contact anyone else. Okay. So maybe she did something to your phone. Or maybe she found Rod and spoke to him directly. You think? I think you gotta talk to her first. You gotta start with her. Yeah. You're right. But what about Rod? Well, isn't that what you've always wanted? For him to see how amazing you are? How can I tell if his feelings are real or if he's just under some spell? If all you've done is open his eyes to the truth, then I guess you just do whatever your heart tells you to. He said he wants to take me to dinner tomorrow. Anywhere I wanna go. It was kind of amazing, Fish. Oh, look, I'm happy for you, Chels. But remember, if you really have been given the power to enchant people using this naughty list, you also just need to remember the power that entails. Of course. But think of all the good I could do with it. You think you could start by making this fake nog taste better? 'Cause I could really go for the real deal right now. Mm‐hmm. Well, I don't need magic for that. I know how to make real eggnog. ‐Because you're perfect. ‐Come on. I'm coming. Fish, please tell me you have whipped cream. We were trying to be healthy, remember? I can't believe it, I'm giving up my Friday night to drink eggnog with no whipped cream? Seriously? You're the worst. I will go out and I will get some right now. You just say the word. I'm only teasing. A, I know how to make whipped cream from scratch. And two, there's nowhere else I'd rather be on a Friday night than here slummin' it with you. Yolks, separate. "Thanks for a wonderful weekend. Love, Rod." Huh. Wow! Who is this from? ‐Rod. ‐What? Yeah, we had dinner Saturday and brunch yesterday, and he's just been like a dream date. So romantic and so sweet‐‐ Oh, are we talking about the same Rod? Ha‐ha‐ha. People change, Maxine. ‐Okay. Hey, I meant to ask you, do you know if we have the contact info for Mrs. Kringle? Accounting would have it since they cut our check. Great. Can you get that for me, please? ‐You got it. ‐Thank you. ‐Chelsea? ‐Oh, Simone. Good morning. ‐Morning. Cute reindeer. ‐Oh. ‐Yup. Thank you. ‐Oh... So I'm guessing Thursday went well? The photos are absolutely amazing. Thank you. Yeah, I really was so happy with them. And it looks like the techs are on track to have the app upgrade ready for implementation by tomorrow. That's amazing! I'm really excited for people to start using it, find their way to the good list. Mm. Well, looks like someone already has. Yes, I have, I guess. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. What do I do with this? So I still think we should go with my slogan, "Download now and Happy Holidays from your good friends at the good list." It just... It‐it sounds way more approachable to our brand. ‐I totally agree. ‐Yeah. I‐I don't know, I feel like it's... Like a yawn? Uh, I was going to say, I feel like it's a little too focused on us as a company rather than the actual brand. Whereas "The good list, download now for your next great holi‐date" is more of a real spin on our brand, but with the holiday twist. Um, I mean... Well, you know, it like, it‐it does have a good ring to it, I guess, yeah. And, you know, since ultimately, we went with my interface... I'll let you have it. You're so sweet. ‐Thank you. ‐Of course. ‐I really appreciate it. ‐Mm‐hmm. Hey, so, strangely, I couldn't find anything on our Mrs. Kringle. Wait, what? Seriously? That's impossible. I know. She wasn't in any of our agency submissions. And Accounting said that she left all the paperwork in her dressing room totally blank. The only thing that she filled out was this talent‐release form so her face could be shown. Here. Did you see that? See what? Oh. Um, nothing. This is it? I think so, but I'll keep trying. By the way, uh, now that things are all peachy between you and Rod again, just curious, your friend Fisher single? Fisher? Yes. ‐Perpetually. ‐Oh. Cute. He's cute, I mean. Oh, Maxine. I say, why not? Go for it. Wait, Maxine. Why did you say it like that, though? "Now that things are peachy with Rod." Oh, I just thought maybe you and Fisher had something, but if not... ‐ Hey! ‐Hey! So, it's holiday speed‐dating tonight at Piper's Pub. ‐Let's go. ‐Absolutely not. And don't you think it's a little too soon for you to be replacing Zane with another‐‐ He who shall not be named shall not be Zane tonight. Now, go get ready. Keeg, I really need to finish this. And I really need you there with me. I thought we were working on not being so needy. I'll work on it tomorrow. Come on! Keegan, I can't.

Chelsea, I wanna be the only person that makes you happy, nobody else. You don't need to talk to all of these guys. It's just, it's just me and you. ‐Right here, babe. ‐Oh, boy. I had a lot of fun with you this weekend. And the reindeer, oh! And the macaroons, oh, that was, that was a sweet gesture. Um, but I think that we should just ease back into us, okay? Is there somebody else? I just think we should take it slow. I don't want either of us making any rash decisions that we wouldn't normally make. Um, I may need some pudding, please? Yeah, I know it's not my cheat day, but I'm really gonna need another pudding, please. Figgy pudding, right away. ‐Is that okay? ‐Yes, of course that's okay. Good morning, Chelsea. Good morning. ‐Hey! Good morning. ‐Hi. ‐Uh, here you go. ‐Oh, thank you. Do you think that maybe we could, uh, work in the open workspace today? It's just feeling a bit stuffy back here. Blythe? Hi! Oh, my goodness! Good morning! Look, look how amazing my new office is. Aah! ‐Yay! Yay! ‐Yay! Oh. I wish Blythe would only tell the truth. Well, team, the upgrade is pending. Our execs are trying it out and they love it! They think it's going to be a holiday hit list. Congratulations to Blythe and Chelsea. You guys killed it! Easy job. And a special thank you to Blythe here, who basically spear‐headed this entire campaign. Well, thank you, Chelsea. I am the best even though I don't really believe that on the inside. Oh, come on, Blythe, don't be humble. Sit up. We all know how much work you put into this. Oh, no, actually, I barely put in any work at all. I found someone's sketches in the recycling bin and did some tweaks and, boom, I won! We did throw some sketches in the recycling bin. Blythe... are you saying you found someone's pitch in the trash and used it as your own? Uh, honestly, I, I did my own pitch, Simone, but I‐I just didn't think it was good enough because I never think anything I do is good enough. Ah, and then when I saw the one in the bin and how amazing it was, I, I just assumed that it had been discarded and wouldn't get used. I didn't realize that Chelsea had actually just upgraded her own idea, and I actually couldn't believe that you chose mine over hers, because hers was clearly better. Aah. Um... but you did, which was amazing, because I wanted this promotion more than anything. Nope, and also my husband just got a major pay cut at the yoga studio. I... Blythe, can I see you in my office, please? Righty‐o. Awful. I knew it. Just awful. ‐Yup. So, what happened then? ‐Oh, I don't know. I didn't see her or Simone before I left the office, and we have tomorrow off for the rest of the weekend. But I'm sure Simone wouldn't fire her over the holidays. I mean, she probably just got demoted or something. And Rod? Keegan? What's happening with them? Oh, everything's great. Rod is a total dream, Keegan has found herself again. Fish, you should've see her pour that drink on Zane. It was a holiday classic. Okay. Just be careful with this thing, all right? Make sure you think before you use it. Oh, please. I totally know what I'm doing. Plus, I'm only giving good lessons out to help people get back on the nice list. In fact, I feel like I kind of deserve an extra‐special spot at the top of the nice list for all the good deeds I've been doing as of late. Well, ahem, here. For your good deeds. ‐What? What is this? ‐Go. Open it. These are from my favorite gift shop back in Colorado. I know. This is so sweet. ‐Thank you so much. Well, I didn't get you anything. ‐Okay. ‐Just kidding. Wha... What? Ah, what is this? Open it. Aw! What? You even got my initials on it? Chels, thank you. This is amazing. Thank you. I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me this year. Honestly, I feel like this isn't enough. Well, if you feel that coming to my parents' annual Christmas‐potluck‐ from‐around‐the‐world party, we could call it even. The present of my presence is yours. I'd love to. Do I get to wear a kilt? Yes, you do. Hey! This spread looks amazing! Oh, hi! Probably not as amazing as whatever you brought. ‐Well, mom, dad, hey! ‐Hey. Oh, my honey. Mm! This is Chelsea. Chelsea, Didi and Danny, the dynamic Dougherty duo. Chelsea, it's so nice to meet you. ‐So nice to meet you. ‐Yes. ‐Thank you for coming. Oh! ‐Thank you for having me. Fisher has told us a lot about you. Yeah, just that I was helping with your app when I was here at Thanksgiving last year. Yeah, and that on 4th of July you moved in next door. And on Christmas, I think you said you're putting up lights together, and I think there was some Easter thing that you do‐‐ Yeah, yeah, mom, yeah. Uh, she gets it. Wait. He didn't tell you that we dressed up as Dorothy and Scarecrow for Halloween this year? ‐Fisher! And did he tell you that he totally saved me last New Year's when my boyfriend didn't wanna leave this stupid party, and I couldn't find a ride before the stroke of midnight? And, thankfully, I am lame. So I was just trying‐‐ No. Your son is anything but lame. I bet he didn't tell you that the app he's helping me with is a huge success. Wow. I am not surprised at all. And what exactly is this app again? Uh, it's one of those swipe dating apps, actually. But it's more geared the old‐school way of matching people based on similar interests and values. Wow! That sounds intriguing. Is that where you met your boyfriend, dear? Uh, no, actually. We met at the gym. Uh, the good list has yet to bring me love. Although, I still believe it can. In fact, I'm hoping it's working its magic as we speak. Well, uh, maybe you should be on that app, hon. I mean, trying to meet all those beautiful women with similar interest and values. I mean, you might be missing out on meeting someone great. ‐Like Chelsea here, huh? ‐Yeah. Fisher's issues with the app are somewhat justified. Oh, yeah? And, uh, what are these issues? Some of the people on the app are only offering a better‐scripted versions of themselves. Precisely. And I'm starting to see that altered self‐perception is something we can all be a little guilty of, at times. Well, I don't think you've ever had an altered perception of yourself yet, son. No. He doesn't, does he? Well, it's gonna be an hour before that turkey is ready. So, who wants to play some games? ‐I do! ‐Yay! ♪ We're laughin' we're laughin' havin' a good time ♪ ♪ I like the way that my breath freezes in the cold ♪ ♪ We're shopping we're dropping under the bell shop ♪ ♪ Oh we could light a fire... ♪ ‐ That was close! ‐Oh, God! ‐Is that it?

Chelsea sure is everything you said she was. Plus, she is the cutest thing ever. ‐Yeah, I know, right? Look, I know you like being the nice guy that Chelsea always comes running to when her boyfriend is not so nice. But where does that leave you, Fish? Mom, w‐we're just friends. That's all. Well, I have been watching you two all afternoon and you sure have an awful lot of chemistry for being just friends. It's just the way we've always been. Well, I think she likes you, Fish. I think she likes her boyfriend. So... Mm, she's here with you, though. Yes, mom, I will pack plenty of kaftans for when it's cold at night. This is not our first Christmas in the Caribbean, you know? Okay, and remember to tell dad he has to promise he'll do Christmas carols in the cabana again or else I'm just not coming. Okay. I love you, too. See you soon. Bye. ‐Cold? ‐Yes. Excited about seeing your family? Yes, I am. Even if it means Christmas with no snow, my family still knows how to make it Christmas. ‐It's still no Colorado, though. ‐Exactly. Oh, I... But this was nice, though, meeting your family. It must be nice to live so close to them. And also terrifying. I really like them. Thank you for inviting me. Thanks for coming. They really liked you, too. Probably more than I do. I'm teasing. Only teasing. Okay. Being here had me remember how much fun we had last New Year's Eve. Just the two of us, driving in your car in traffic. Plus, I kind of owe you for that. And so, I was thinking that we just do the ridiculously‐overpriced downtown New Year's thing that you were suggesting. But what about Rod? Don't you think he's gonna wanna do something with you on New Year's Eve, provided he's still under your mystical, magical Mrs. Claus spell? So, I just tell him that I can't. Honestly, he owes you, too. Well... Definitely don't wanna get in the way of your big holiday plans. You're not. Most of the time, you're the one saving them. Morning, Peggy. ‐Guess what. ‐Thank you. What? The corner office is all yours, Ms. Simms. What about Blythe? Simone fired her, obviously. And she was out this morning with all her stuff. Well, but what about her husband's pay cut? Yeah, but that's on her. She shouldn't have taken your idea. ‐Oh. I like how these look... ‐I know, right? Just... ‐Yeah. ‐Hey, Chels, hey! ‐Oh, hey! Oh, hi, Fisher! How... W‐what are you doing here? I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I would bring over some congratulatory sandwiches. ‐Wasn't it so sweet? ‐Oh, that was so sweet. Wow, that's so great. What are we celebrating? The app upgrade? It went viral. Did you not check your email? Oh, wow. No, I didn't. I didn't see it. That's... Um, I must've been super‐slammed this morning that I just didn't even notice, which is weird. Moving into her fancy new office. ‐No. Chels, that's amazing! ‐Uh‐huh. Congratulations. Okay, can we eat? Yes, let's all, let's all eat. ‐There you go. ‐Thank you. Thank you. Check it. It's you! Uh, right on. I wish Fisher would see me the way I see him. ‐Hey, hey, hey! ‐Hey, hey, hey! How are you enjoying your new office? It's wonderful, really. So you know we launched a new upgrade this morning? We are already getting rave reviews. It's incredible. And... a little holiday bonus for all of your hard work. Wow. I really appreciate it. You don't seem too happy for someone who's just been promoted. No, I'm... I am, I'm so happy. I just am overwhelmed with the launch party coming up. ‐Oh, right. ‐Yeah, it's a lot. Yeah. Listen, don't work too hard. ‐Seriously, okay? ‐Okay. Well, I'm off tomorrow and Wednesday, but I will see you Wednesday evening. ‐Yeah, see you at the party. ‐Yes. You should be proud of yourself. ‐Fisher! Hi! ‐Hey, Chels. Hey. ‐Are you doing all right? ‐Yes. Anything new? Anything at all? No, I was just out doing a little last‐minute shopping for a little thing I'm having at my place tomorrow night. ‐You should come. ‐Oh. Okay. Cool. I'll be there. Wait! Um, can I bring anything? Great. Uh, I don't know. Mm, well, a couple of holiday dips. Uh, a batch of cookies. Mm. Or some of your delicious eggnog. Ah. And a sugar‐free, fresh‐pressed fruit punch. The moms love it. Yeah. Yeah. I can get all of those things and I'll come over, and we can make them together. Oh, ah, ahem... Well, I'm probably gonna be getting ready over at the place, getting the place all set up, so maybe you could just make them all here and then bring them over? Mm‐hmm. That sounds good, too. It's good. Yeah. Great. Thank you so much. You're the best. Hey. Are you sure you're okay? I'm, I'm... good. Great. Awesome. Okay. Have a good night. Do I really ask that much of him? Is that the way I've always seen him? Keegan, can you come out so we can go over this stuff for the launch party? You don't have to shout. I'm right here. What? Oh! What is it? Oh, spider? Where is it? Ooh! I‐I hate spiders! Keegan, what happened to your hair? And you're wearing black. Oh, I cut it off. It was so binding. I just, oh, I just felt, I feel so free now. Like Princess Di, like a real sense of independence. ‐Keegan, you loved your hair. ‐Oh, I still have it. I swept it up, and put it in a box in my shoe closet. Well, so... let's over the party stuff, shall we? I've organized everything in this spreadsheet so we know what's been completed and what needs completion. And I've put all the invoices into a folder for your accounting. Yeah, yeah, that sounds, sounds really great. But maybe you want me to take a super‐cool photo of you, huh? Yes! For your story. Huh? Oh. I had to leave FaceFun. Who needs it? I certainly don't need validation. Now, come on, let's get to work. Your hair... What have I done? ♪ Snow falling shepherds brawling ♪ ♪ Tables set and grandma's calling ♪ ♪ Light the tray wide away ♪ ♪ Hang and watch The Grinch on TV ♪ ♪ But oh babe am I late? ♪ ♪ Gotta get my good deeds in my time... ♪♪ Wow. I didn't know that Fisher had friends. ‐Me neither. ‐Chels, there you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. We need to talk right now. Nothing screams independence like a motorcycle, right? My ex had one, and I'm thinking about maybe getting one. Really? The whole thing is totally weird and I don't even know how to explain it, but, first, Fisher matches me as a friend on the app, which I was kinda bummed about, but then I was like, "Whatever." But then he shows up at the office yesterday after asking me all these questions like, "How do I ask Chelsea out? Do you think that she would say yes?" And telling me that he has been crushing on you for, like, the past year, and demanded me not to tell you. But then tonight, it's as if he has totally flipped his script and is suddenly showing interest in me. A‐and I, so, obviously, I had to tell you. I think the problem is I've been sending Fisher mixed signals. Oh. Okay, but do you actually like him? Because you know if you do, I would never get in the way of that. I do, Max. I really do. It's just taken me some time to realize it. Well, okay. ‐But what are you gonna do? ‐I don't know. But I have to fix this. Happy Holidays. Hey, Chels. Hey. ‐What? ‐I, uh... Um... Oh! Hey! ‐You okay, Chels? ‐Yeah, I‐‐ Chelsea! ‐ Oh! ‐What's going on here? Rod? What are you doing here? Well, I was gonna take you on a big, romantic Christmas date. But, apparently, you had other plans with handsome little neighbor boy. ‐Uh, nope. ‐Uh... I think there's some sort of mistake. Uh, nope, I don't think there is, because you have liked her from the very beginning and you cannot deny that, buddy boy. Okay, seriously, what's he talking about? He's right, Fish. I was just too blind to see it. I was so caught up in my own stuff, trying to be what everyone wanted me to be and... I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? I, uh... I saw you talking to Maxine at the office the other day and I thought you two were flirting, so I put you on my naughty list. I was hoping that it would just have you see me the way that I see you now, only, it just had you take me for granted. Because that's how I've treated you this whole time, and I just, I just didn't see it. I'm sorry. Wait, you put me on a list? I'm sorry, what list? ‐Chelsea? ‐Oh, my God. ‐No, no, no, no. ‐Lynn Simms. ‐Rod, what are you doing? ‐Uh, her middle name is Lane. Shh! Sorry. Chelsea Lane Simms, don't marry him. ‐Uh... ‐Marry me. Seriously, Rod, stop. Can you, can you get up, please? Thank you. We could elope. We could get married right here. ‐Right now. Christmas wedding. ‐Oh! I'll take that. Ugh! Um, look, Rod, I'm not ready to marry anyone yet, okay? There's just been a little bit of a misunderstanding. Can we, can we talk outside, please? That'd be good. Did you really think I would do that to you? No, Maxine, I just‐‐ I would never compete with you over a guy, Chels. You should know that. Maxine... I didn't mean to put a wedge between us. I was just trying to bring us closer together. What exactly did you write? Only that I wished your feelings for me were different. Well, congratulations. It's now there. You all right? Not really. The hair, the makeup, this whole weird feeling, I'm not quite feeling myself. You did this to me, too, huh? Keegan, I'm so sorry. I thought I'd be helping you be a little more independent with Zane‐‐ And from you, too. I assume. Well... I sure hope you can find a way to fix it. A 100 percent naughty. How do I get back on the good list? Mrs. Kringle? I told you, anyone can find themselves on either list. You also told me to remember what the naughty list was for. I completely lost sight of it. Oh, these things happen, dear. I mean, we're all guilty of taking our loved ones for granted sometimes. But... I hurt the one person who has never taken advantage of me. I feel awful. But, see, that's the beautiful thing about people like you and Fisher. You're giving and very forgiving. And he will forgive you... in some time. How do I make this right? How? How do I make all of these people go back to the way they were before? That's all I want for Christmas. No Colorado, no gifts, just everyone I love to turn back into their true, perfectly‐imperfect selves. Well, all you have to do is just write their names back on your good list, dear. And what about me? How do I get back on the good list? Let's see, um... Wishing good things to people you love. I think you already have. For Santa's eyes only. Right. Oh, wait. I can't just put that on my resume. I didn't really do that. And I have to take that off because that's a total exaggeration of my skill set. Thanks, honey. "Blythe, I found your original pitch in the recycle bin, too. It wasn't bad. We could've really competed, you know? And with that being said, you deserve my bonus. Happy Holidays. Chels." "Thank you for always being at the top of my good list. I'm sorry." ‐Hi. ‐Chelsea! ‐Blythe. Hey. ‐Hi. I'm sorry. Uh, wait. What are you sorry for? I just... I felt bad that you lost your job over the whole ordeal. It's the holidays. I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. Chelsea, no, you cannot feel sorry for something that I was totally in the wrong for. You deserved that promotion. And I knew it. But this check... I mean, thank you so much. I‐I can't even tell you how, how much this means to me. But, honestly, I‐I don't really need the money. My husband made a ton of money in tech before he quit to do yoga. So, like, we're, we're good. Your husband actually did web development? Of course. I don't lie about everything. I mean, come on. Well, um, I mean, except for the, the ad pitch. But only because it was really good. I really wish I'd come up with it. And I saw yours, and it was really good, too. Not as good as yours. But thank you, that's... You're too sweet. Um, I mean, honestly, I have been out of the dating game for so long that working brand strategy on a singles' app probably wasn't the best idea. Anyway, here, um, have so much fun at the launch party. ‐Thank you. ‐Um... And good luck. Thank you. Blythe... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you, too. And do something good with that money. No. Do something great. Bye. Okay, wait, can you move it just a little bit, uh, an inch? Yes, perfect. I love it. I didn't see you this morning, but I did see your FaceFun account is back in action. This looks incredible. ‐Oh, yeah? ‐Yeah. Thanks. My parents even stopped by earlier, too. Said they were more than a little impressed. I'm so happy for you. Keegan, I always knew you were more than a silver spoon. Then I suppose I should thank you for helping me see it for myself finally. ‐Wow. I love you. ‐I love you. So you're finally feeling full of yourself. A 110 percent needy at the moment, but I'm working on it. Oh, wait! We need a picture of this now. ‐Yes, I will take your picture. ‐Okay. I would love to, I don't want to do anything more than I want to take your picture. No, silly. I meant together. Hey, can you take a picture of us? ‐Thanks. ‐Thank you. Cheese! Oh, wait, this is my good side. Okay. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! ♪ Fa la la la la la la ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la laa laa... ♪ Hi. Merry Christmas. ♪ Fa la la la la laa laa... ♪ Hey, guys.

So, as I was saying, I just thought, what a great way to keep the twist going into the New Year, right? New Year, new love, swipe for your resolution to love. Isn't that just genius? Yeah, it's, it's cute. It's cute. Maybe you can take that to Chelsea at the office. Wait, to‐to Chelsea? Um‐hmm. Oh, you haven't heard? Maxine was promoted to junior, so you report to her as her assistant from now on. ‐Yay! Will you excuse me for a second? Sure. Who's ready for some Christmas carol‐oke in the snow? ‐ Whoo! ♪ Love's getting so much warmer... ♪ Max, I'm so sorry.

Can you print that out for me? That's good too. Uh, we'll be right back. Okay. How is that here? You know, your homemade nog is giving me new New Year's resolutions, but Santa's totally responsible for eating all those cookies. Wasn't me, seriously. Well, maybe one. Well, I'm just happy you could still fit in that suit because you look really handsome tonight. Well, thank you. You look beautiful. But that's you, like, every night of the year. Fish, I am sorry. I completely just got so caught up in this story of people taking advantage of me, I couldn't see that I was doing the exact same thing to you. Chels, you didn't take advantage of me. With me and you, it's always been a two‐way street. It's honestly what I've always loved about you. That's really sweet. And we both know that my side of the street had a little more traffic on it. ‐Maybe. ‐I messed up. I should have admitted to myself a long time ago that I had feelings for you. Well, it must have been hard having a catch like Rod around all the time. I would've been torn, too, he's... Not funny. I've actually kind of been afraid he might just show up tonight, even though I know the spell's broken. You never know. He, he still might. Okay, then we should leave. ‐We should go. Yeah. ‐Let's go. Just before we go, just... Admittedly, it was a remarkably smooth move. Thank God it was caught on camera. Well, maybe it can be our Christmas card next year. ‐Next year? ‐Oh. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Simms. We haven't even deleted these apps off our phones yet. ‐One. ‐Two. ‐Three. ‐Three. You still have a lot of making up to do before I'm ready to commit to a year with you. Well, you live next door, Fish, so... I think you're committed whether you like it or not. Hmm. Yup. Shooting star! Maybe it's a sign. Well, if it is... we'll take it. Merry Christmas, Chels.
