LITTLE TOKYO, LOS ANGELES Who is your boss? Tell me what I want to know. - May I speak with Mr. Tanaka? - Mr. Tanaka no longer owns this club. Honorable new owner, may we speak with you? We are leaving now. You can't kill two L.A. cops. Too many people saw us come in. I'm sure you will try to kill me again. Is that all? That's not enough? How can we make this right? Bring me the head of the blond cop. That is the only way. Toss the finger in the trash. Hide yourselves. The fun's not over yet. Leave the cop's car. Heavy metal sushi.
