White Badge Hello? Hello... Hello. The next stop is Gwanghwamun. Gwanghwamun! Gwanghwamun! Trying to stop the flow of blood from the wound, He asked the president if he was okay, he said "I'm fine." holding his chest. Even the great President Park got killed, by none other than his right-hand man. 18 years, man. Be quiet. Let's watch the TV. What TV! This is a re-run. It was on last night. Anyway, you guys should be doing something, instead. Go out and get something. - When did you get here? - Now. - This is all useless, amid this mayhem. - Exactly. You should know better. Special news is everywhere now. Reporter Kim, go to Donggyo-dong from today. Stick around until you get an interview. Let's go. Reporter Park, where're you going? If Kim's going to Donggyo, I'm going to Sangdo-dong. Check off all the news that won't make it to the paper. Sniff out the students, the underground organizations, and more. Gi-ju, let's go to my seat. Coffee, Miss Kim. Oh, gosh. This is too much. The script? I can't. Let's write about something else. We're a news magazine. We can't carry a love story. President Park is gone. Perfect timing to delve into the Vietnam War. This is Korea Journal. Ah, Prof. Kim. In our editing meeting... We can't mess with the current military regime... This bastard! We deleted a few lines for his own sake and he's giving me a hard time. He wants me fired? I get pressure from both the right and left wing. You haven't had lunch, right? Let's go day-drinking. You've been drinking, right, dad? Why did I attempt to write a novel about the Vietnam War? The war still keeps haunting me and ravages me mentally. I know you drank, dad but it's okay with me. Can I really turn my nightmare into a novel? Wow. Here, this one, too. I can't see you this vacation. Why? Me, mom and my stepdad will go to America. That's nice. But, if you go, it will be better. I was wrong. That damn war! We put an ad about it in the magazine last month. I won't write it. Can't. Hello. Hello. Hi. Can I speak to Han Gi-ju? This is he. Sergeant Han... Right? Who is this? This is Byeon Jin-su, from the war. Do remember me? Private Byeon! Han, you were alive! Of course. We were on the ship together, coming back to Korea. I saw in a magazine that you were going to write about the war. Good to hear from you. Byeon, how are you doing... Bye. Byeon! Hello! Damn it! What the hell am I doing? Yo! We came all the way here to Vietnam to do this? Some bastards go to combat on a chopper. Yes, the war was disappointing. The fierce battle scene from the movies was not there. We were digging the ground for 2 months. We had mixed feelings, hoping that a year will pass by like that and thinking we were missing out on action. 10 minute break! Is that from Su-jin? Yes! While studying, she looked up and saw the snow falling. And that's why she wrote this letter. Snow? Snowy night. Sergeant Han! This guy got kicked out from a theater. He hugged the picture of the actress and ruined the movie sign he was painting. Stop everything! Stop everything! I can... Yes! Who is this? Your sister, a second year dance major at a university. Voted as Miss Angel unanimously by the 1st Platoon. That's that, sir! Okay. Good news. I delivered your wishes to my lovely sister and she said she wants to exchange letters with one of you. Wanna be candidates? Fall in! - I'm number one! - Number two! Look at you guys! - Hey, Juice. - Yes, private Yun Ju-shik. - Jerk! - Yes, Private Juice. Is your wife dead? A wife and a girlfriend are different. - You're right, jerk! - Ouch. This is not for you! If you have a partner, opt out. If you have a girlfriend, leave. A soldier's weapon is a gun. Sergeant Hong! Yes, Sergeant Hong. - Then what's a man's weapon? - This one. We will conduct a weapon test. When I say "go", you pull down your pants. I say "go" again, pull down your panties. - Panties? - Go! Go! These bastards. Go. Go. These jerks! You've never been to a battle but wearing bullet proof panties? Whose panties? My mother sent these. My sister sent these. My sister sent these. - I... - Did your granny send them? You bitches, take one step back! The rest, go! Go! Is yours fresh? Yes, I checked it at the infirmary yesterday. Bullshit. Your leaky pipe won't work. Pull up your panties. Go! Go. The next is a competence test. - Byeon! - Yes. I will give up the honor for Corporal Kim. Listen to this bastard! What's the reason? Kim and Yeong-ok will be a good match. I've never been to college. - Attention! - Yes. At ease! Attention! At ease! Attention! Private Byeon, after a courageous fight, lost his arm, and couldn't paint movie signs any more. How will you support my sister? Answer in 5 seconds. 5,4,3,2... Ladies and gentlemen on this bus, I joined that infamous Vietnam War and took the grenade to save my comrades and lost my arm. This dirtbag. Are you begging? You didn't lose both legs! Who! Who challenged me! Han Gi-ju, was it you? Who looks down on Vietnam War veterans? Please, buy these pens. Sergeant Kim, coming back from the Vietnam War. This pen is only 5 times more expensive than normal ones. Are you going to buy or what! Wow! Byeon! Byeon! Shut up, you bastards! - Byeon! - Yes. Private Byeon. - Can you make it back alive? - Yes, I'm confident. Byeon. Byeon! This is driving me crazy! This is fun. But can it satisfy our intellectual, snob readers? Except a few lines, it's just cheap comedy. For example, provoke the snobs by saying "At war, intellectuals turn into cowards, and the ignorant are reborn as heroes." You can start like that. Or, now President Park is gone, so how about "At the Vietnam War, I joined as a soldier and came home as a mercenary." You can start like that. Excuse me. I think a Han's fan wants his address. Hello. This is Han. So, Han Gi-ju has fans... Ha! Private Byeon. Last time why did you... There? Yes, I will be there. - What're you doing? - I think it'd be better if you write. I already paid you the advance. Sir. Been waiting long. 1,2. Sergeant Kim, coming back from the Vietnam War. - Hey, veteran! - Yes. You are feeling good today. No, I'm just saying that I like that song. If you won't come home, let me know where you are. I'm heading out. Well. - Go ahead. - Yes, I... I saw Sergeant Han, who's writing about the Vietnam War. He told me I changed. His wife is pretty, of course not as pretty as you. The rice is under the blanket. And I can't come home tonight. - Hello. - This is Private Byeon. Oh, Private Byeon. What happened? So you got it already? I'm sorry. What're you talking about? I thought it might help your writing. I will visit you sometime. Bye. Private Byeon! - Are you Han Gi-ju? - Yes. Your package. Your signature, please. What's this noise? What happened? - Which direction? - There! No enemy movements though. Platoon Commander, it's a misfire. Listening post guys made the mistake. Bastards. I was so ready for some action. - Go back to your positions. - Yes. I woke up for no reason. - Keep watching. - Yes. Why are you so gloomy? Su-jin wants to me to come home to meet in person. She's impatient. And? She's getting nervous and impatient. Ask her to send you her panties. They make you bullet proof. It's not about that. Maybe there's a new guy. She's saying no, in her picture. These Vietnamese mosquitoes are crazy even in the rain! You bastard, you didn't put on anti mosquito cream. I did. I saw you hoarding it in the locker. Why? Are you going to sell it? I will give it as a souvenir so my mom will... You're crazy. You are hoarding empty shells, too? I will give them to the kids in the hood... When I kill Viet Congs, I will collect these rather than their ears, to give them as a souvenir to the village girls. You guys are not dozing, huh? No problem here, sir! Sergeant Kim, will we ever get any action in this war? Dude, you want to die early? Die? Not me. Corporal Cho, I'm not crazy. I can't keep painting an actress's butt. Why do you think I joined this war? I will open a sign shop with the money saved here. I will open a little bar in Seoul. No problem here! Jin-suk, the girl who writes to you, is she a bar girl? - You promised to open a bar with her? - No, sir. - No? - Yes. You're right. - How many letters did you get from Yeong-ok? - Two. - And you wrote back? - Twice. - What did you write? - No, I just drew a picture. What? I never wrote a love letter. Don't know how to. That's no good. Should I change my brother-in-law? Get help from Han and Jeon. Write one by tomorrow. And get it approved by me, okay? Yes. Don't doze off. Hiccup. Hey, Private Byeon! Private Byeon! What's it this time? There. There. There. What! Look over there, bastard! There! What? Look! Viet... Vi, vi, vi, Viet Cong. - Contact! - What the! - Where? - I can't see! There! Call the Company Commander fast! Fox! Fox! Where? Can't see. Sergeant Hong, my gun's not working. Flare! Cease fire! Which bastard said Viet Cong? What is it? Sergeant Han? They want us to pay for the dead bulls and damaged fields. That's what's wrong with this country. Why? Are they doing something wrong? Hey, Sergeant Han. When we fight for them, their fields, mountains, roads and buildings get messed up. We can't help it if we are to get the Viet Congs. But this is different. We are to blame for what happened. What! Are you trying to lecture me? The colonel is already working on compensation in the commander's room with the village elders. The colonel and commander are crazy. The heat got into them. Not only the Viet Congs but the water buffalos are a nuisance. Bug off, rascals! Hey! Gi-ju! Hey, you don't come here. Bug off, you bastards! You come here. - Stop it. - Why? No reason. These are brats! Chocolate! - Damn it. - Eat this! Hey, Han Gi-ju. Why aren't you drinking? Here. Why do you have to be like that at a school reunion? Honestly, how many Vietnamese girls did you bang? I heard they are very tasty. - That's too dirty. - Dirty? As if you guys didn't? Luckily, people haven't changed from when I came back from the war. They were only interested in Vietnamese girls, battle stories or saving money. I bet he didn't kill any Viet Cong. Luckily, they don't ask what I got from there. I didn't defend Vietnam's freedom or peace. I only defended my pathetic life, while getting more confused about human values and history. That's why you got kicked out by your wife. Hey! Be easy on him. Frankly, you got rich thanks to the Vietnam War. While he was risking his life, your family got rich on military supplies. What's wrong with that? We made money thanks to President Park. When President Park died, my dad cried. I will splurge this dirty money. I will pay for all this today! What's wrong with that jerk? Hey, we didn't mean that. Hey, Han! I will treat you to a full course today. You take this. You send him to heaven today. Good for you! Bring more drinks and get the band. Bullshit. What? What did you say? - Calm down. - That crazy little... - I didn't start it! - Are you crazy? Be cool, man. How did I end up here? I've never been rejected like this. How funny! You hurt my pride. Even though you were that drunk... Still... The bill is settled. Hey, this is no fun. You even went to Vietnam. Can you give me another chance to restore my pride? This is my bar. Am I being silly? Maybe I have a crush on a stupid novelist who giggles, while humiliated and drenched in alcohol. Private Byeon? Private Byeon. The door was locked so I was waiting... Thanks, Sergeant Han. - Please leave it. - It's okay. Come on here. Have a drink. It will warm you up. You know I can't drink. I read your novel. I was almost the main character last time. Who will be the main this time? Corporal Cho and Sergeant Kim are there, too. - Private Byeon! - Yes. I have a question. Why did you send this to me? That? Where's your wife? You said I changed a lot. Me? When? I think I did change. I definitely changed. You, too, changed a lot. Look here. Yun, Cho and Corporal Jeon must have changed, too. They died. When? Did you meet them after you came back? They died at the war. Right. I went to Yangpyeong to meet Corporal Cho. - He lives with Ji-ok. - Corporal Cho... I didn't see him but I think of him a lot. He was such a chicken. He'd get scared at the tiniest noise... and got hiccups. He was a good guy. - Did he come back? - Yes. Now that I see you, I remember many things. Private Byeon, please answer me. Where did you get this gun? Okay, why did you send it to me? I thought you'd keep it well. Keep? Okay, I will keep it. - You have to register it. - Yes. I will try one glass. This is good. Like you say, it warms me up. In Vietnam, we only drank canned beer. Everything was American, food, cigarettes, gum... On a rainy day, we'd pile up boxes of beers in the barracks, and had a singing contest, remembering our homes. Tears are pouring, tears like morning dews... Is it still raining a lot? Private Byeon! Private Byeon! Without fierce battles, we got used to the stakeout. Kim's jungle-ravaged face was the only telltale sign of war. Killing and being killed was not our story, yet. 6 months after I came to Vietnam, we were ordered to search a small village. The village was compromised, so it was our duty to find the enemies and take over the village. Sergeant Hong, burn everything down. Commander, there's an underground tunnel. Is it? Kim, take Yun and go on a mole hunt. Yes, sir. Move! Corporal Cho, are you okay? - Cho and Byeon, follow me. - Yes. These damn chickens! Sergeant Han. Should I call the commander? Lift it. Get down! Hey, go in! Well...Sergeant Han, I got cramps on my legs. Get out. Sergeant Han, did you get the Viet Cong? Han, what's wrong? Hey, what's going on? Sergeant Han, are you okay? Commander, we got prisoners. Let's go. Move! This bitch. Commander, we got this from her. Sergeant Kim, interrogate her. Follow me with them. Hurry. Hurry. Sergeant Han, what's wrong? Your Viet Cong was such a mess so I couldn't drag him. So I got his ear. I need proof to get a medal. Sergeant Han. If you don't talk, you will die. Talk! Where? Talk! Talk. You bastard! This bitch. I'm pregnant. I will have a son and will send him to the jungle to fight. You dirty Koreans, leave our land! What is this bitch saying? Sergeant Kim, leave it to me. Stand up! Follow me! Talk! Talk! Hurry. You mean bitch. You want some of this? Right, Viet Cong's face is here. No! Sergeant. Colonel, that's the kind of face I wanted. This is great. The platoon members must be tired. Just one hour, please. If you say no, I will call General Kim. Hey, you can't smile. Act more painful. More. Great! Will this be on the news? Hey! I told you not to look at the camera. We'd have to edit there. Also, Lieutenant Choe, drop a smoke bomb in that cottage. Push it harder. Good. That was good. Look more tired, here. Hey, this way, don't sit. Who smokes during the battle! What the! What the hell are you doing here, reporter? If you want to make a fiction, call real actors. We're not here to help you. - Corporal Jeon. - Get off me. It's either dying here or going to jail. It's cold. What happened to you? You're holed up here, not answering the phone. You want to see me fired? You're not welcoming me here? Hey, give me some coffee. What a pigsty! Anything wrong? Hello. - Private Byeon. - It's you. I tried calling a few times. Why did you leave it here? You have to keep it for a while. Come and get it. Okay, but not now. Bye. Hey! This is it! I knew you could do it. Han Gi-ju! You still got it! Hahaha... It's crazy popular now. It's all the rage. Publishing wants to put it out as a book. I am not writing any more. Gi-ju, you want a quiet hotel? I am not writing. Get that. Don't say that. I will get a hotel room. I told you I'm not writing. You, jerk! I never want to think about the Vietnam War, got it? I know how you feel, but you need to write it. You're finally being recognized as a writer. Money and fame await you. We will pay a special bonus on top of the script fee, so write it! I will come and get the script next week. Rushing it wouldn't work. Jeon, are you really going to do it? Yes, I hope to meet a girl who looks like Su-jin. - Let's just go grab some drinks. - Alright. If I knew this'd happen, I'd have ravaged her when she was visiting me. What? This is her last letter. You should read it. Get lost, you beggars! Hey, here. Come on. Come on. Lalai boom boom(sex). Beaucoup congkai(many girls). You are mine tonight. You're ugly but your hair is like Su-jin's. Oh, this way? Sergeant Han, have a lot of fun. You really don't regret this? - No regrets. - Okay, okay. Did you prepare the rubber? No worries, Sergeant Han. Take it off. Okay. Wide open. Dear Hee-sik, spring is in full bloom here. A week ago, I strolled along the trail alone, where we used to walk. I walked up the creaky steps and had coffee, too. Everything was the same, except that you weren't there. Hee-sik, I'm so sorry. I don't know how to begin. I got married to a friend of my brother's. Someone said, modern people can't hold on to longings forever. He stood by me when you were so far away. I cried a lot on the first night thinking of you. I really want to see your tanned face just once. Hey, what're you doing? Aren't you going in? You good, too. Hey, she's mine, bastard! I paid! Get lost, jerk! Get away! Hey, what the? Get lost, jerk! Hey, man. Get on up. Hey, you. You fucking asshole. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. You know what I'm saying, man. We came here because of you, jerk. Hey, Jeon! I got my cherry popped today. Are you going to do it or what? You are really impotent, huh? Right? Damn. This sucks. Oh, gee. Anyway, I found out that it had nothing to do with me. Oh, gee. A writer? Yeah, right. I shouldn't have written a novel in the first place. That chaotic nightmare was much better. Because of that novel, Byeon showed up. And then, the gun. I need to find him. Oh, honey, tomorrow I'll find out when I'll go back to the states. So, you'll quit your job and tell Byeon that you're leaving. I'll take you back to the states with me. What's in here? There's nothing. Don't hurry and look around. Don't tease me and just tell me. Memories. Memories? We sang, walking hand in hand, don't you remember? When we met a third time, after you came back from Vietnam. Well... In a little hut by the railroad, the baby sleeps well. Choo, choo, choo, the train passes by loudly, but the baby sleeps well. Remember what you said after the song? What? Shall we have a baby? Did I say that? And you proposed to me. Right? You remember? No? Jin-su, are you alright? Yeong-ok, I need to go somewhere. I need to see Corporal Cho. Now? The guys became emotionless. They didn't show their pain or anger. All those feelings were burnt up in the sun. The non-stop operations, deaths and heat beat them up, making them callous. A month before our homecoming, we had to do a 1-week search mission. Our mission was to find the enemy's stronghold deeply hidden in the jungle somewhere. It was scary, but the only solace was it will be our last mission in Vietnam. Five days passed without any lead or result. On the last day. Hey, Yun! - Hey, Yun! - Medic! Hey, Yun! Sergeant Kim, where did I get hit? Am I okay? Yes, you are okay, bastard. Yun, say something! You, bastard! Hey, you need to get your money back from me! Yun! Take his bullets and wrap him up. Damn. Yankees, when killed by bombs, get stitched up, given a makeover and transported in a freezer to their homes. This damn Yun used to send all the battle pay and even C-rations to his wife. Poor bastard. 11 o'clock! Medics! Medics! 10 o'clock! Cease fire! Leave it to me. Sergeant Kim, take our members and the injured to the landing point. I will find the enemies with the other members. We will be there before the sunset. We will leave without making them pay for this? Byeon and Mr. Hiccup, follow me. You guys stay here, without making a sound. These are civilians! There must be guns somewhere. They're civilians. You are Koreans. Why did you shoot us? We are innocent. Take care of one, each. Hurry, bastard. We have to kill them. No choice. I can't. Can't. Don't move. I can't. Can't. - Grab the knife and stand up. - I can't. You jerk! You saw me doing it. What are you waiting for! Hurry, bastard. Now! Cut the ear off. Hurry, jerk. Hurry, jerk. Yes, that's how you do it. Cut everyone's ear off, except the child. Commander, this is Sergeant Kim. What took you so long? We had a situation. We got three Viet Congs. We were engaged in a hand-to-hand combat. Are you still scared of killing Viet Congs? Get ready to sleep and for the night watch. We will sleep in shifts. Hey, Byeon, I'm scared. I got an interesting story. The girl sending me the letter, Jin-suk, is actually Ji-ok. I promised to Ji-ok that I will open up a bar in Seoul. Byeon, I have another story. Earlier, when I was cutting off the ear... Be careful. We killed the enemies. They were Viet Congs. Right, bastard? It will be the same when we return or are discharged. You cut off a Viet Cong's ear. Don't forget. If you say otherwise, you will lose your ear. Tell that to that bastard, too. You fell asleep while on the watch? You dirtbag! If you can't find him, you will go to jail. - Get up! - What? What? Viet Congs cut his ear off as revenge. Viet Congs got his ear? To pay back Sergeant Kim's group for their deed yesterday. - Report death, Corporal Cho. - Yes. Hurry, hurry. Private Byeon started to act strangely from then on. But no one could afford to notice. Everyone was partly losing their minds at that point. The prime minister, depending on student protests, will decide on the emergency martial alert... Our business is ruined due to the martial law. Can I ask something, sir? Sir? Ask away. My ears are open. - This is tired. - Sis, you should look after me. - Who are you? - Well... - No Koreans here. - That girl... I heard that I was very popular among my brother's platoon members. I was supposed to be a dance major in college? We were orphans. It pained my brother to see me working here. Jin-su came to me as soon as he came to Korea. He was disappointed at first but proposed to me on the third date. I was really touched. After he was discharged, I stopped dancing, and he painted portraits for American soldiers. But he became weird when I got pregnant. I didn't think much of it, but one day, he strangled me and kicked my belly. I had a miscarriage. After that, he became really docile. But he'd ramble on and got scared of something. He would leave home and won't come back for days. So, I had to dance for American soldiers again. Then, I met an American officer named Harry. We fell for each other, and decided to go back to America. I can't handle Jin-su. The Vietnam War took everything from me, my brother and Jin-su. Did he say where he was going? He doesn't say such things. But this time, he said he'd meet Corporal Cho. Cho Tae-sam! Yes. If he shows up, tell him I dropped by. Yangpyeongok Poor guys. Welcome. Everyone's coming, now it's time to leave. Everyone's here? Yes, they're waiting. Go into that large room. Here it is. Did you get the pay? Yes, sir! We got all. Let's go in. Commander, bring more drinks and meat. You, Lieutenant... Oh, you came. Corporal Jeon, I hear that Su-jin came to visit you today. Did you give her a farewell ceremony? You respected her all this time, so wait another year. Hey, you are too naive. What if she betrays you? Action first, then report. You don't know that? I planted my flag today. This chick says, "Dae-jin, this may be the last time." "I want to give you everything." So, in the middle of my lunch, I ran to a motel. In broad daylight? See? For reals? Give me one. - This is awesome. - Take them all. Don't move, guys! - Here, here! - It's mine! This is great. So, if I wear a girl's panties, I won't get shot? Wait! How about all the virgins here pop their cherries today? Wow! Sure! - If you're a virgin, raise your hand. - Me, me. They're lying. Cho Tae-sam? Why aren't you raising your hand? From the looks of it, he's surely a virgin. Anyone objects choosing Cho? - Me. - You such a... You bastards won't raise your hands? We decided on Cho. Ji-ok? Guys, let's sing a song first. - Sure. - 1, 2, 3, 4. The Southern Cross is my mother's face Dreaming about her I dream about her You bastards, come on out quickly. He drank so much. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. What's going on? You need to pay, though. This is all our paychecks. That will cover our drinks and Cho's hookup costs. For the remaining money, we will all come back and drink with that. We will come back alive, no matter what. Yes, you will come back no matter what. All attention. Salute to our commander! Salute. Wait. We should take a picture. Sergeant Hong, why are you making the box so big? You want to put a girl in there? Jang, Sergeant Hong is the smartest. He's got everything, a TV, a recorder, a fan... Hey, I went through a lot to get these. I bribed Lee in accounting with so many beers. This sucks. Someone puts treasures in their homecoming box. I feel sorry for the dead. You jerk! Are you saying that to me? - Sir, getting ready for the homecoming? - Homecoming? I only need this. I got a permit from the company commander already. - Don't they check the baggage? - Well, if I get caught, whatever. Damn it. A mssion when the homecoming is so near? The enemy will have a full-on attack tomorrow? No complaints. Tomorrow's operation will be the last in Vietnam. Also, our platoon will be in the rear. Don't lose sleep. Dream about the homecoming. This is a massive operation! But our job is just to defend the village here. This is all useless. Useless. What is he mumbling about? Useless. Useless. What're you saying? Many foreign troops came and left in 70 years that I have lived. First, Chinese, then French, Japanese, American and now you guys. This is all useless, as it has always been. If you really wanted to help us, go back. - What's he saying? - He says we should go back. He says not to meddle with his country and get lost. Can't believe I'm busting my ass just before the homecoming. Without that guy, I can buy another camera. What're you thinking? Su-jin? I don't even think about her now. When you got that breakup letter, it was so bad. Yes. I loved her. I was going to give her this, when I return... Saigon. Saigon must be beautiful. It may be but here... It was a season from hell, like in Rimbaud's poem. Corporal Cho? Hey, bastard. They call me Venereal Disease Cho. I will avenge for your brother-in-law, when Congs show up today. You wanted to go to medical school? I failed twice and joined the army. I will try again, once discharged. If I go back to school, things will be the same? School life will hardly be romantic. I used to join a school protest. We were innocent then. I feel like everything was taken away from me for the past year. Hee-sik, why did you join? I can't remember. Was it a group hypnosis? War! It was vanity. Like, I wanted to experience war. Damn, only two hours left. I'd never even pee towards Vietnam. Hate this place! What's that? It's a Viet Cong! There. Enemy! Commander. - Where? - That direction. About 20. Get ready. Wait for them to get nearer. Shoot the flare! They're coming. Call the company! Jerk, get the Company Commander! We will shoot according to the coordinates. Contact! Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! Cease fire! Is everything okay? We need to move. Cease fire! Damn bastards! - Who got shot? - I think Corporate Seong. I said cease fire, damn it. - You jerk! - What happened to the commander? Get M-60. Medics! Medics! Where did he get shot? - Medic, hurry. - Coming. Damn. He's dead. The second squad is okay. They're pouring in here, commander. Get your ammunition and keep your post. They're coming. - Get your stuff. Stay where you are! - Get down. It's a bomb. Get the grenades ready! They're coming. We need to move. Stay put. The support shooting will not be enough. Si-chan! I told you to wear the helmet! Get this, bastards! There's no cannon support? Shoot everywhere! I don't care if they fall on us. The commander is dead. All of us are dead anyway. Just shoot everywhere! You bastards! Grenade! Get down! Private Byeon! - You the most senior among the survivors? - Yes. Go and do the head count. While your platoon was fending off the main troop, we could take the enemies' stronghold easily. It was like a bait. - I didn't know you'd hold out well. - Yes, General. But our Commander is dead and so are many others. It was sacrifice of few, in terms of the whole military. That's what war is about. But too many people... Captain Park, give awards and medals to all of the platoon members. Yes, General. What head count? Everyone's dead. Where's everyone? What happened to the platoon? We were in ambush, with Corporal Cho. What! Everyone's dead. Dead! Everyone's dead! You son of a dog! Everyone's dead! All of them! You jerk, everyone's dead. The train runs loudly, but the baby sleeps well. The baby, the baby sleeps well. The baby, the baby sleeps well. Vietnam veteran! Sara wanted you to have this. Choo, choo, choo, the train passes by loudly, but the baby sleeps well. Hello. Can I speak to Han Gi-ju? This is he. Who's this? This is a hospital. Do you know Byeon Jin-su? Yes. Why did you do it? Well. After Yeong-ok left, I felt better and felt like cutting my ear off. After cutting it off, I felt great. I feel refreshed. Sergeant Han, it's a Viet Cong! Got to move. Private Byeon. Private Byeon. Private Byeon. Martial Law! Private Byeon. Hey, come on! Hey, Private Byeon, come on! No! - Revoke martial law! - Revoke martial law! We're not students. We're citizens. Get lost, jerk! It's okay. That was it. You knew everything. That's why you followed me. - It's scary! - It's okay. Okay. I'm okay. After I came back from Vietnam, I thought someone was following me. So I was carrying a gun all the time. It's true. Someone was following me. But then, because I was carrying a gun, I felt like shooting myself. But it was scary. Scary. But I want to die. I want to die but it was scary. Then, I saw you. So, I sent you the gun. At first, I thought the follower was Corporal Cho and Sergeant Kim, or even the Commander. But it's good because you were following me all along, right? Oh, you're keeping the gun at home, right? I think everything's been squared away. I will visit you tomorrow, Sergeant Han. Private Byeon is still wondering in the jungle. After 10 years, he's still looking for other members and death in the jungle. Private Byeon! I can't leave him wondering around any more. Can I send him back to where other platoon members are? I need to write a novel, a really good one...
