(silence) - [Voiceover] The origins of Chinese Kung Fu are shrouded in the mists of antiquity as far back as prehistoric man, imitating the movements of animals as he sat around the cave fire. And so the tradition was handed down. But there was no system to it, nor any structure, until the Abbot of Shaolin, concerned for the wellbeing of his monks, refined Kung Fu into 72 basic styles. As a result the monks of Shaolin became the leading exponents of Kung Fu throughout China. (dramatic music) - Mr. Cho. - I suppose you want to be my student. - Yes. I'm Sun Li Ting. I've pledged myself to learn Kung Fu, but I know I'm still ignorant, I have a long way to go. I've been looking for a teacher without success, but I heard you're an expert, so I have come to test you out. - Test me? I thought you wanted to be my student. - I want to have the best teacher, but you can't beat me at Kung Fu, how can I ever expect to learn anything from you? - (laughs) All right. You've got guts, and you're smart. - And if you do beat me, feel free to use this stick to beat me for my insolence, and I promise you my complete loyalty. - All right. And if you beat me, I'll not be your teacher. - I am very grateful. (grunting) - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - Now. (fighting noises) Hmm. The butterfly kick. (fighting noises) Heh. Do you know any other styles? (fighting noises) - I'm sorry. - Were you just using the Wu-Tang School method against me? - I've learned so many styles, forgive me. - The study of Kung Fu fighting is ongoing, don't ever hope to master all of them. So be careful. - Thank you for your advice. (creaking hinges) - Bye. - Goodbye. (clattering coin) (chattering) (explosion) (chattering, yelling) (scuffling, yelling) Mister, don't lose your temper with a boy. Can you tell me what happened here? - He's a theirf! He stole our money. - Who do you say stole your money? It's nothing to do with me if you gamble. (chattering, yelling) - Gentlemen! Can't you see you're way clear to forget it? Whatever you lost, I'll pay. (yelling) - [Hsu] Liar! A pack of lies. I never stole that much! I swear I only took four tails of silver. - Here it is back. (yelling, quarrelling) - All right, I don't want any trouble. Let him go. (yelling, quarrelling) - You're even worse than them. - But it's their money. You should give it back to them. Aren't you grateful to me for saving you? - Why should I be? I didn't need your help, they wouldn't have beaten me to death. - Oh, why not? - So if they kill me, they'd have to pay for my funeral, a waste of money. They wouldn't do that. - Hm. - Hey, where are you off to? - Where I go is none of your business. - Whatever your reason, you did help me. Mother said never forget to repay a favor. If I don't follow, how can I repay you? - Hm. - (laughs) (lively music) - Mister, these are all the dishes you ordered, help yourself. - Want to join me? - You're not such a bad fellow after all. But, here you are again helping me to a big meal. Before you helped me, and now, you help me. You see, I'm helping you help me. (chuckles) First things first, I'm Hsu Shi, but I don't know who you are. What's your name? - Sun Yi Ting. I'm looking for a man who can beat me at Kung Fu, so I can learn from him. - You want to learn? Mmm. That's a laugh. And you haven't found a teacher? - Mm. - Perhaps I can help you. We have a place here called the Victory Gym. (applause) The man who runs it is an expert. - Gentlemen, gentlemen, the most powerful blow of all: (mumbles) - [Hsu] Here it is. (lively music) (thudding) - (laughs) (applause) And there's much more to see now. (fighting noises) (clanging) (cheering, applause) - Thank you, thank you! And now the Iron Captain style is one of the supreme achievements of Kung Fu, it's impossible to hurt me. If you think you can, then register here. Come on, register here, register-- - Master! This man. - Oh, you want to register, do you? Where's your money? (chuckles) - Sun Ting Yu, I like Kung Fu, I want a good teacher. - Oh, you've come to just the right man, I am the best teacher there is. 20 silver tails. - No problem, but before I pay you I'd like to have a fight with you first to test. - (chocking) What's that? You dare to challenge me? - Yes, that's right! If your Kung Fu isn't better than his, what's he going to bother learning from you for? - Eh? What's that? He knows Kung Fu already? - I've done all that much, but no one's beaten me for five years. - What's that? For the past five years, nobody's beaten you? - That's right. Shall we start our (mumbles)? - (mumbles) Hey, hey, heyy, get in there lads. (chuckles) Show him what you're made of, come on, get in. (fighting noises) (chuckles) - Master, please. - Oh, I'll show you how good my Kung Fu is. (fighting noises) (crashing) Oh, goddammit. (fighting noises) (groaning, yelping) (fighting noises) (crying) I'm done for. - I hope it didn't hurt. (fighting noises) (crashing) (applause, cheering) I'm sorry. - Mr. Sun, you were great, really great. - [Voiceover] Eh, I'm not going to stick around here. (chattering, quarrelling) - Hey, come back here! (chattering, yelling) - Why did you lie to me? That fat fool didn't know any Kung Fu at all, you were trying to pull a fast one. - Don't be angry with me, I didn't like the way he treated people, I wanted you to give him a good thrashing. You really sorted him out. (chime) Oh! My God, I forgot what time it was while we were talking. - You're really a monk? - Buddha's name be praised. I'm now called Shao Sher. I'm a Shaolin monk. I have a grandmaster who likes his meat and his wine, he requires me to come to town everyday to buy fresh meat and more wine. - Don't believe you, a monk doesn't eat meat, nor does he drink wine, you're trying to pull a fast one again. - I wouldn't cheat you. Hold this. (fighting noises) Seen that before? - Not bad. - I could show you some other tricks. - Hmm. Hmm. - Would you believe me if I said my grandmaster's an expert? He's better than you. (dramatic music) This is one way to get into the place. Here. Hey, come on. I should let you know my grandmaster has strange habits. I don't know whether he'll take you, that depends on your luck. We just have to go ahead and find him. Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Where are you? - You son of a bitch, stop yelling. Here I am. - Huh? (chuckles) Grandmaster. Ow! - You good for nothing, where have you been all this time? I hope you're not trying to starve me to death, eh? - I'd never do that. You gave me no money, but you wanted fresh meat. What am I supposed to do if I can't pay? - (laughter) I've got faith in you, my lad, you'll make it yet. (laughter) - [Sun] Hold it! (fighting noises) - How's that, you OK? - You stupid bastard. What do you think you're doing? How dare you bring a stranger uninvited? What're you trying to do, to get me killed? - Grandmaster, you shouldn't say things like that, I would never do that. He is Sun Yu Ting, he's a good man, and he wants to learn Kung Fu. So, I brought him along to see if you'd like to have him as a student. - Abbot, I've been looking for a good teacher, he said you're an expert. I'd like to test you. - Hmm. You want to be my student, and also you want to challenge me? Both of you want me to demonstrate my Kung Fu, but it isn't so simple. - Ah? Try again. - I have heard that you are an expert, well my guess is you're afraid to fight me because you're not confident you can win. - Ha! You're a stupid young fool. (fighting noises) I'm going to teach you a lesson. (fighting noises) - Uhg, what, that stinks! Oh! - It stinks? Heh, you're the one doing the smelling. - (grunting, groaning) - Better show me some respect you young pup. - (choking) - (laughs) Or I'll have to punish you. - (groaning, spitting) - [Abbot] (laughing) (fighting noises) Do you still want to fight me, then? - (grunting, groaning) No, I don't. I've seen enough to know you're an expert. Please, let me be your student. Teach me Kung Fu. - No, I don't want you. Why should I? What use are you to me? I don't need to have any students. - Grandmaster, this (yelps). - You said enough. You'd better quickly get this fellow out of here. If your superior finds out he's here, you'll be in deep trouble, my boy. Go! (chuckling) Jack of all trades but master of none. Too bad, too bad. (chuckles) - Ahh! I have an idea. Hey, don't worry, I think I know a way he'll take you on. But you must do what I say. - Hm. (dramatic music) (gonging) (humming, chanting) (fighting noises) - Not bad. This is the style called hungry tiger. - What Kung Fu is that? - It's called Shaolin Tiger Fist. (fighting noises) Watch this: tiger comes out, tiger hiding. Right now, tiger undefeated. (chuckling) How was that? Weren't you impressed? - How much Kung Fu do you know? - (laughs) Not much. - Hm. - Hey, you mustn't give up. Buddha teaches us always to have hope, whatever the situation. - Hey, Buddha never said that. - (chuckles) Does it matter who said it? Hey, the main point is you shouldn't give up so easily. Hey, are you still intent on learning Kung Fu from my master? - Certainly. - Then there's only one alternative. You will have to steal. - What do you mean? - My grandmaster is a good man. If you beg him, he'll give it to you. But if he refuses you, then you attack him. Learn that way. He'll have to fight. It's a simple trick, after all you want to learn his Kung Fu, not just to call him master. - (snoring) Huh? Hmm. Hmm. (sniffing) (lighthearted music) - That smells good. What'd you say we split it 50/50. - (laughs) Split it in three! And give me the possum's nose. (laughs) (scuffling) Come on, where is it? Hmm? Where is it gone? Hey! Give it to me. - Grandmaster. - Easy now, no need for that. Hand it over to me, come on, now. - All right. - Give it to me. Come on! Give it to me! Hey! - Master, let me be your student and I'll give you a chicken. - (mumbles) - Ow! Grandmaster. - You're a disloyal mate. How dare you help him to cheat me, explain it now. - Grandmaster, I wouldn't dare! I'd never do anything against you. - Don't you try to get out of it. I know just what you want me, you want me to teach him Kung Fu. I know what you're up to. I'm warning you, I have basic rules: I drink plenty of wine and I eat red meat, and I take no students. - (chuckles) If you are aren't going to take me as your student, oh, I'll just have to eat all this chicken. - Hold it! (laughing) - Don't try taking it from me. Nuh-uh. I'm not giving it to you. (fighting noises) You can't have it, you can't have it! - Hey, watch out for the chicken. (fighting noises) - Possum's nose. - Oh, mmm! - Hey, quick, watch his moves. (fighting noises) You OK? - I'm all right, I'm all right. - Go on, go on. (fighting noises) - Never mind, go on. - All right. (fighting noises) Why'd you have to keep hitting me there, for? - Because I like to hit you there. (fighting noises) - (moaning, yelping) - Why'd you fall on me? - You lying (mumbles). You use your small Kung Fu against me when I know so much? (laughs) You're a fool. - (groans) - Hey! How was it? How much did you learn? - He hit me so often, I only learned one style. - Huh? Only one style? - Are you ready? (fighting noises) - (chuckles) Fight with both hands. All right, I got it. Ah. Ahh. I'll block it. - Very good. Now we'll see what happens. He won't hit me in the chest again. (birds chirping) - (chuckles) Hey there, I see you're improving. I want you to cook a roast duck for me, and have a (mumbles). - Oh, I'd be happy to do it. - Mmm. Smells good. It looks tasty too, should be nearly done. - Yes, it is done. - Ahh. (yelps) (dramatic music) Oh! When will you ever learn? How dare you play tricks on me? You're asking for it. - Now, grandmaster, easy now. It's all a mistake. - A mistake? (grunts) Come down. - (yelping) (crashing) (moaning, yelping) - (laughs) - Hey, quick. It's a good chance, go on. (fighting noises) - That doesn't work on me. - Doesn't work? Well, you'll see. (fighting noises) - Ahh! - (chuckles) Your basic Kung Fu's no good. You can't move fast enough, and you don't have enough strength. And your body movements are like a street fighter, it's too easy for me to trip you up. (fighting noises) (laughter) (grunting, yelping) How's it feel, eh? - (groans) That's not good. I fear my back's broken. - Yeah, you've still got a lot to learn. (fighting noises) - Grandmaster. - (laughs) You're improving, not too bad now, huh? - Not good enough. Ah! Grandmaster! I don't dare. - I'm sorry. (laughs) (yelping, groaning) (chuckles) Thank you for the chicken. (chuckles) - I'm afraid it's too hard for me to learn Kung Fu. - Don't say that! I'm half dead because of you, I'm the one who's suffered! (fighting noises) - How's that? You giving up? - Brother Sun, I give up. Will you forgive me? It's my back. - You can't give up, on your feet. - I can't stand up. Give me your hand. - How's that? Are you better now? Huh? - I'm all right. You can take that! - Bastard. You were tricking me. - I wasn't, brother Sun. I was testing your reactions. Not bad, you're a born Kung Fu fighter. - Who said that? He just learned a few styles, what's good about that? If you meet a real fighter, you ain't gonna stand a chance. (shuffling) - [Hsu] Master! (shuffling) - He's prepared to let me learn from him, so why does he refuse to take me as a student? - He has his reasons. - You know what they are? - About 10 years ago he had one student who was called Chi Kung. He was an intelligent lad, and he used to practice hard. Grandmaster was devoted to him, he taught him everything he knew. But, he didn't know Chi Kung was a Lama, chief of the Golden Wheel Lamas. Earlier, the former chief Lama had visited Shaolin, and Challenged the Abbot, Jack Yung. (fighting noises) He was seriously injured in the fight. He made his way back west, and before he died he made Chi Kung take a vow to avenge his death. So Chi Kung laid his plans, first of all he came to Shaolin, later he stole the secret Shaolin manual, the book of I-Ching. (dramatic music) (fighting noises) - [Voiceover] Don't let him go! Hold it! (fighting noises) - [Abbot] Hold it. (fighting noises) Huh? Chi Kung. (fighting noises) - Grandmaster started drinking wine from that day to this, he hasn't missed a single day. - Where is Chi Kung? - After he'd escaped from Shaolin, grandmaster sent out many men to look for him. For the past 10 years we haven't found him anywhere. - Hmm. - Hey, there's no need to be upset. I have an idea of how you can learn Kung Fu more quickly. - How's that? (fighting noises) (orchestral music) (fighting noises) - How is that? You think our Shaolin Kun Fu's pretty good? (fighting noises) - (speaks foreign language) - (mumbles) Master. - Master. - What'd you think you're doing? How dare you bring an outsider to watch our practice? - Master, I didn't dare. I didn't dare. - Where are you going? (fighting noises) You're not allowed to leave the Shaolin temple. - First, tell me who you are and what reason you have for coming here. - I am Sun Yu Ting, I like Kung Fu, and I want to be your student. - Rubbish. What is your reason? You must have a reason. If you don't tell me, you'll be severely punished. - [Hsu] Grandmaster, he's telling you the truth. I know he's interested in Kung Fu so that, uh-- - How do you know? Where did you meet this gentleman? - [Hsu] I-- - Master, Hsu Shi met him on the outside, that is the only way. He will have to be punished for breaking the rules. - Listen, Abbot, I want to learn Kung Fu. It was my idea that he should bring me along, you mustn't blame him, please. Punish me instead. - Buddha's name be praised. You are prepared to do that? At least you are loyal. It's just too bad that we take no students, you will have to look elsewhere. Ji Hung, can you show the gentleman out? - [Ji] Yes. (dramatic music) Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. (lighthearted music) (crosstalk) [Master Tsu] Please, help yourselves, help yourselves. - Thank you. Master Tsu, you have entertained me very well, I am very greatful to you. (laughter) - You don't have to mention it. Tibet's so far away, and as a good friend of my assitant, I welcome you as my guests. - Thank you master. Here, let's toast the health of our chief. - Thank you. To your health. (yelping, groaning) - (laughs) - Wang Kang, you double crossed me. And you, you. - Chief, you're just not smart enough, that's all. We've already placed our oath to our new master. (dramatic music) - Huh? You what? You (mumbles) (fighting noises) Run for it! - No, I won't! (fighting noises) Father! (fighting noises) - Run princess, go! (fighting noises) - (groaning) Daughter! - Father! (fighting noises) - Mi Tsu you can't leave. Peddle off to your new master, and we'll spare your life. (blade slicing wind) - How could all of you men be so wicked? My father trusted you, but you've betrayed him and then murdered him. I swear as long as I live, I'll tell everybody I meet about your crimes. I want the whole world to know what plans you have to take over control. - Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you. (fighting noises, metal clashing) - My friend, how dare you take advantage of a defenseless young woman. (blade slicing wind) - We're the Sky Hawk Clan. Stay out of it, if you want to live. - I'm not going to allow it. You leave the girl alone. I can't just pass by and ignore her plight. - (mumbles) I'm going to teach you a lesson. (fighting noises) - Go back and tell your chief I'm Sun Yu Ting, and this lady stays with me. (groaning) - (spits) we won't forget you, we'll be back! Come on. (somber music) - (wincing) - Are you OK? Go over there and take a rest. Sit down. - Thank you for saving me. - I had to help, you were alone. I couldn't permit you to be killed. But you've been badly hurt, I better get some meds. - Thanks a lot. You're too kind, I'm most grateful. - You should be safe here, nobody will come. Wait for me and I'll be back soon. - (yawns) - Hey, Hsu Shi, Hsu Shi. - Huh? - I've got a friend who's badly hurt, can you get some medicine for me? - (mumbles) are healthy, I haven't been hurt. Why do I need medicine? (punch, yelping) - Ow! What did you hit me for? - Well, you've been hurt now, haven't you? So get me some medicine. - Ah! My luck deserted me the day I met you. The Abbot will punish me, he really beats me hard. Uhhg. Buddha's name be praised. (lively music) - Sure this will do? - This is the finest medicine we've got. As long as he's alive, he'll recover. Now go on, go on. - Hey, don't forget (mumbles)-- - I got it, I got it. OK, go. - So Yao Fang Lin is a Tibetan Lama, he's taken over our clan and plans to use the Sky Hawk Clan to control all the other fighting clans. He was afraid I would tell of his plans, so he tried to kill me. - Lady, you take it easy. I'll sort out this Tibetan Lama for you. - Oh, this is Hsu Shi, and he's my best friend. - Buddha's name be praised. This Yao Fang Lin is a wicked man. When people know about his plans they'll stop him. You'd better eat. When you're better, I'll go and have a word to the other Shaolin Monks. They'll know what to do. - (laughter) (dramatic music) Little monk, you've got a big mouth. Sun Ting Yu, I warned you we'd meet again. Our new chief at the Sky Hawk Clan. - You're a filthy traitor, I don't want to be near you. If you didn't come after me, I'd come looking for you. - Bastard. Too bad. Your courage will be the death of you. (fighting noises) Hmm. Who the hell teaches you Kung Fu? You don't know a thing. Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well. - Who said that? So late at night, this hardly the time for such slanderous trash. (dramatic music) - Hm. - [Sun] Grandmaster. - [Hsu] Grandmaster. - Hmm. You're useless. - Old monk, stay out of it. It's nothing to do with you. - Buddha's name be praised. I enjoy good food and wine, and I love a fight. You're the ones who'd better leave, you run a great risk challenging me. (fighting noises) - Huh, tiger. Snake! (fighting noises) - Your Kung Fu is useless against me, now tell who your lousy master is. (fighting noises) Move! You had overlooked, a lousy student may-- - Hey! - A lousy student may... have a good master. (groaning) - Grandmaster, so you've again to take Sun as your student? - What would I want with such a lousy student? He will upset me each time I see him. (chuckles) (dramatic music) - Captain Wang, you mean you were no match for one defenceless girl? I suppose you've got an excuse. - Ah, it's all my fault. I never expected this old monk to show up, he was too good for me, otherwise she'd be dead already. - A monk from Shaolin? What was his name? - I'm sorry, I forgot. - Forgot? (laughs) I can't really blame you, but little wonder we're having trouble with you as captain. (fighting noises) (gasping) - Please forgive us! - Master, shall we attack the Shaolin? - No, not yet. We must kill the girl, we can't have her telling our plans. (fighting noises) - Mi Tsu, be careful. You've only just recovered. - (chuckles) (dramatic music) What a nice young couple, you must really be leading a pleasant life our here. Too bad it's going to end so soon. - This is Yao Fang Lin. - Mi Tsu, don't believe all of the lies an ignorant young pup like that tells you about life, otherwise you'll live to regret it. And now, you're gonna leave with me. - I'm going to take revenge, I'm going to kill you. (fighting noises) - Mi Tsu, Mi Tsu! (fighting noises) (dramatic music) (fighting noises) (intense, suspenseful music) (fighting noises) (suspenseful music) (fighting noises) - Kang! You're a traitor! (lively, dramatic music) - Go after them, and don't bring them back alive. Go after them. (response in foreign language) - This way. - There they go! (energetic dramatic music) - [Hsu] Brother, would you let me through? - My friend, it's a temple rule. No strangers are allowed in. - [Hsu] Brother, they'll be killed. Do me a favor. What's going on? - [Master] Hsu Shi, what is it? - Master, please help me. - Master. - Hsu Shi, how dare you come back here with a woman? You know the temple rules and you have deliberately broken them. I cannot forgive you this time. - Master, their lives are in danger, they're being pursued. I had to give them sanctuary. Master, as a Buddhist I have a duty to others, I cannot let them be killed. (fighting noises) Master, there are the people who've been chasing us, they're the ones. - All right. I better take them into (mumbles). I'll talk to you later. (fighting noises) Buddha's name be praised. This is a temple, so kindly behave and obey our rules, or you risk our wrath. - We're the Sky Hawk Clan. We've come here in pursuit of a traitor, and we demand that you hand them over to us this minute. - Buddha's name be praised. They have sought sanctuary here, they're under the protection of Buddha. You had better turn back, I'll talk to these people later and decide myself if they're traitors. And if they are I'll return them. - If you don't hand them over right now, we'll burn your temple down. - You are a monk yourself, how could you dare say such a thing? - Hm! We Lamas are traditional enemies of the Shaolin, I'll make you eat your words. (fighting noises) - (weeping) - Hey, be patient. The hospital is just over there. - (weeps) (fighting noises) - Buddha's name be praised. The Shaolin temple is holy ground, how dare you fight within these premises? - I assume I'm addressing the Shaolin chief, Yang Zu? - Yes, I am the Shaolin temple chief, Yang Zu. I am responsible for everything that goes on here. - (chuckles) Glad to hear it. Hand over the traitor immediately, otherwise I'm going to fight you, Shaolin monk, to the death. - Your attitude surprises me. If you approach this temple in humility, you will be welcomed as an honored guest. - Old monk, I don't have time to listen to this. Hand over the traitor right now, or else we'll have to take her ourselves. - If you insist on ignoring what I've said to you, you leave us no choice but to use our Kung Fu. (fighting noises) Please gentlemen, turn back now. - Old monk, I swear, we'll meet again. Come on. - Yang Zu. - Where are those two? - I put them in hospital. - Send them up to my chamber, they need to be interviewed. - Yes. - This is a temple for training monks. It is not a refuge. I'm afraid you must leave here immediately, and don't ever come here again. - Abbot, I've been many places for years, looking for a master. Please, take me on as your student. - Buddha's name be praised. I've made my decision. I won't take you on as a student. - Brother, you may refuse but I am more than happy to accept him. - Brother, you really want to be his master? - That's right. He is intelligent, and he is brave, and he was born to be a fighter. - But you know the rules. We don't accept any students at this temple. - I know. Once we have that traitor Chi Kang. But brother, you are aware the new Sky Hawk chief is Chi Kang himself? - Buddha's name be praised. Brother, this man, Chi Kang, has caused us much trouble in the past. We sent monks after him, but I am afraid that we went against the teachings of Buddha. I think we can forget him. Anyway, he will die soon, Buddha will see that he gets his just desserts. - You mean we're going to leave the I-Ching manual in his hands? - (sighs) It is fated. - But, eh-- - [Hsu] Grandmaster, you are wrong. - Hsu Shi, how dare you talk like that? - You've forgotten wher you are? - Ji Ku, let him have his say. - Yeah. - Grandmaster, you who have taught us that in order to help people we have to practice virtue, but you let Chi Kang commit crimes, and he kills innocent people. He's a devil, but you won't interfere. Isn't that against the laws of Buddha? Letting evil thrive? Besides, - Continue, let's hear it. - Besides, this man, Chi Kang, threatened to burn down the Shaolin temple. He's power mad. If you do nothing to stop him, he'll control all the clans, the common people will suffer. And to be sure, so will we suffer, grandmaster. Think again, how can we face our ancestors with this? - Mmm. Buddha's name be praised. For one so young, you're most eloquent. That was very well argued. - Can I take it then that I can take him on as my student? - Buddha does allow us to study Kung Fu to beat evil. But gentlemen, please remember you have to practice mercy. Do not use violence unless you must. Mr. Sun, you understand what I'm saying? - I understand, and I am willing to convert to Buddhism. - That's good. That's good. - Thank you, master. (orchestral music) - Brother, Chi Kang isn't going to rest till he kills her. You had better take her to Phoenix Court, she'll be safe enough under their protection. - Yes, sir. (dramatic music) - [Chief] Kneel down and bare your head. - The ceremony begins. First we cut off all your hair to sever links with the past. From now on, you are a Buddhist monk. Show mercy to all the peoples of the world. (lively music) (groaning) (yelping) (lively music) - (yelps) - (chuckles) (crashing, splashing water) (groaning) (splashing water) (yelping, groaning) (lively, energetic music) (fighting noises) You can never (mumbles) fighting. Each move requires all your strength. Come on! (fighting noises) What have I done to deserve a student like you? Why don't you concentrate? What to make me look a laughing stock? Oh, you're driving me mad. (orchestral music) (fighting noises) (applause) - Look here. Look who's become a monk. Are you ready to die now? - It's you. Why are you here at the temple? - I am only visiting. I used to live here. Tell me, what is your name? - I am the monk Chi Sing. - Hmm. So they changed your name already? The Abbot has been very hospitable to you. Who is your master? - Pu Chi Yuh, before he was known as Yan Lan. - That's good. Who'd have guessed that we'd have the same master. - You are a traitor to the Shaolin, so you can't say we're brothers. - (laughs) It doesn't matter, we still have the same master. Because of that I'd like you to tell me, where is Mi Tsu? - I don't know. I wouldn't tell you, even if I did. - All right. I'll have to put the question another way. (fighting noises) For someone who's a Shaolin monk, your Kung Fu is really lousy. (fighting noises) You don't have any power, let me teach you how to use it. (fighting noises) - [Grandmaster] Yao Fan Lin! (dramatic music) - Master. - I'm not your master. (fighting noises) Why don't you fight back? - Because you're my master, you strike the first blow. - I thought I just told you I'm not your master. (fighting noises) - Then please forgive me. (fighting noises) Allow me demonstrate the skill of Shaolin, the special technique of shadow boxing. (fighting noises) - So you've learned the top Shaolin style. - I have had the I-Ching manual for 12 years, if I'd not mastered it by now, I'd regard myself as an idiot. (fighting noises) - [Hsu] Grandmaster! (lively music) - Master, master! (groaning) Master! Master! Master! - Grandmaster! Master, master. (groaning) (somber music) - Oh, brother. (groaning) Chief, brother, I, I (groans) I. - Master. - Yan Lan easy now. Tell me what you want to say. - He'll (mumbles) Come closer here. (mumbles) (groans, gasps) - Master! Master! - Brother! - Master! - Brother! - Master! - Master! - Buddha's name be praised. - Buddha's name be praised. (somber music) (chanting, humming) - Hey brother, where are you going? - I have to leave, to find Yao Fang Lin. - Hey, you're crazy! Nobody's allowed to leave without the chief's permission. - I don't care about that. I've gotta go! Even if I get killed. - Yu Ting, Yu Ting! Master and Master. - Why aren't you two busy practicing? What are you doing here? - Master, please, allow me to leave. I must take revenge. - Your Kung Fu is not good enough. You can't defeat Yao Fang Lin on your own. Besides, you are a Buddhist monk, remember His teachings. You cannot allow yourself to think of revenge. - My master was so good to me, if I don't avenge him I'll never rest. Please let me have this chance, give me permission to leave. - If you want to leave you'll have to first take me on in combat, after that you may go. - Master, please forgive me. I must try. (fighting noises) - Your Kung Fu's still poor, you won't last long outside. (fighting noises) (groaning) - Stop it! Chi Sing, if you still want to leave despite a good reason, I remind you it's against our rules, you'll be confined to your study and clean floors for six months, and read all the manuals. - Yes. (somber music) (fighting noises) - Don't relax, work harder. You have to read more, or you'll never learn wisdom. - Even if I read all the books, what use it it? It won't help me get revenge. - You have to learn mercy, otherwise you will learn bad ways. Your skill at Kung Fu is minor, compared to the state of your soul. You have been confined here for one month already, but you still haven't grasped this basic principle. I feel sorry for you, my boy. (thudding) Under there too, must be spotless. - (groaning) - Abbot, please teach me Kung Fu. - I may be the person in charge here, but when it comes to Kung Fu, I know very little. But I can teach you a few breathing exercises. Once you have mastered how to breathe, you will find your power increases. - How can I learn? I don't know where to begin. - Let's start with the basics. - The way to control your breathing is to let your strength flow around your body, gradually you find that it picks up speed. Do you really still want to learn? - Yes. (dramatic music) (fighting noises) (fighting noises) - (chuckles) That's good. Now you have mastered breathing, you'll find your strength much increased. - Thank you for teaching me. - Now you have to remember... the principle of mercy. Kung Fu is for killing, there is a contradiction to resolve here. If mercy is in your heart and you truly have faith, you'll find your Kung Fu will improve rapidly. (smashing) When your master died he requested the chief Abbots... to let you stay with me. He wanted you to learn the secret style of the Shaolin Buddha finger, because only that style is capable of defeating Yao Fang. The basic thing is to concentrate all your power into one point. You can imagine the blow, you can easily kill, that's why you use it rarely. Don't forget what I said. (fighting noises) Now you can do it. (fighting noises) Listen, softer the better. You'll find it difficult to break it. If you want to use your finger, you'll have to train hard everyday. All right, try it again. (fighting noises) - [Hsu] (yawning) - [Sun] Hsu Shi? Hsu Shi? - [Hsu] Hmm? - [Sun] Where have you been? Don't you know how late it is? - Well what're you asking me for? Fact is, ever since I met you I've had really terrible luck. - How come? - You were just confined to the study room, but I wasn't as lucky as you. Master made me clean out the toilets for three months. Even now, I can't get a sleep because I can still smell it. - Sorry. It's my fault you have had to suffer. - Ah, forget it. I don't mind having to clean the toilets for you, but it's never very good to let someone else suffer for you. - Who? - Who do you think? You've forgotten the girl? It's Mi Tsu. - How is she? - She now wants to be a nun. (sighs) She was such a beautiful young girl, now she's to be a nun. Buddha's name be praised. May Buddha bless her. Please, let this bad man see the light, and let him be free of sin. (beeping) - Buddha's name be praised, Buddha's name be praised, Buddha's name be praised, Buddha's name be praised. (beeping) (suspenseful music) (fighting noises) - Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. Buddha's name be praised. (dramatic music) - Mi Tsu, do you want to become a nun? Don't you think that's a waste? No wonder I couldn't find you. Yao Fang Lin, you. - (laughs) Nobody is going to save you now. (fighting noises) - (yelping, weeping) - (laughs) (fighting noises) - [Ji] Mi Tsu! - (chuckles) Abbot. Nice to see you. But what are you doing out so late? Enjoying the night air? - Yao Fang Lin, you are a traitor. You've committed far too many crimes, you must return to the temple with me. - (laughs) Only if you can defeat me. Then I will obey you. - How dare you! (fighting noises) Mi Tsu, run away! - (weeping) (fighting noises) - [Yao] Hold it! (fighting noises) (orchestral music) - Buddha's name be praised. Amen, amen. (orchestral music) - [Yao] I'll meet you at Hero Hill, tomorrow afternoon. Yao Fang Lin. - Chi Sing, you have to concentrate. Don't tell me you still haven't grasped the fundamentals. - Yes, sir. (fighting noises) - Yu Ting, if you do not concentrate, you will have no power. And without enough power, you'll never defeat your enemy, even if you're more skilled than me. Understand? - Brother, I'll leave you in charge. I will meet with him. - Brother, you're the chief of the Shaolin, you can't risk it. Please let me go instead. - Buddha's name be praised. If I have to sacrifice myself, so be it. Chi Kang is a traitor. While he still lives, peace will not return to Shaolin. I'll take Chi Kang with me. (dramatic music) - Congratulations on becoming a Lama again. - Hmm. It's been 15 years, and now I finally have the chance to destroy the Shaolin. (dramatic music) Master. Will you please forgive me for having to fight you? - Buddha's name be praised. Mr. Yao, you're not my student anymore. So don't call me master. I don't acknowledge it. The reason I've come here is to return the I-Ching manual to the Shaolin temple. Also, I must ask you, refrain from violence, stop all this fighting. - Abbot, surely you remember the time my master came to you in Shaolin and you killed him. I only pretended to become a monk to steal the book. I only wanted to avenge my master and prove we Lamas are superior. I've worked all my life for this, you can't talk me into giving up no matter what you say. - Bless you, bless you. Shaolin monks and Lamas are both Buddhists. Why do we always have to fight each other? - No more talk. I'm gonna beat you. (fighting noises) (dramatic music) - Chi Sing, Chi Sing! It's terrible news. The chief has gone out to meet with Yao Fang Lin. - Huh? Come on. (fighting noises) (splashing water) (fighting noises) (splashing water) (fighting noises) (lively, dramatic music) (fighting noises) - Grandmaster! - (laughs) A master should be better than his student, how come you Shaolin monks protect your master when you're better? (laughs) (fighting noises) Young man, you've improved. (fighting noises) - Power! - (groans) Huh? Buddha finger. - When facing your enemy, you have to aim for his weakest point. Use the Buddha finger accurately and you'll find you will win, whatever he should try to do. (fighting noises) - His weak point's under the arm, you better tell him. - Right. (fighting noises) Under his arm! - Huh? - I'll go for his (mumbles) (fighting noises) (energetic music) - You thought you were unbeatable. How does it feel to lose? - (spits) You may have overcome one of my styles, but that isn't enough. (fighting noises) - Get him! (fighting noises) (splashing water) (fighting noises) - Chi Sing! It is fated, show him mercy. Let him go in peace. - (groaning) You! You! Why don't you kill me? - I've learned to show mercy to the enemy. Even to wicked men. We don't kill. That is our rule. You may go now. - (groaning) I am the devil, I must die to prove that Buddha exists. (splashing water) (orchestral music)
