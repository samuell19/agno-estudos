(jazzy music) (dramatic music) (explosion blasts) - No, discipline is their problem. The British Army. Now, Trenbow, to another hole. - The men have been here too long to observe the niceties, sir. - Not niceties, Captain, essentials. Discipline at the front is essential if we're going to win this war. (explosions blasting in distance) - Fuck off! Oh, sorry, Skipper, I didn't see you. - I thought so. Officer's Mess, Trenbow. It's not a library, soldier. - [Trenbow] The men need some diversion, sir. (puddles splashing) - Say, you! Smarten yourself up, soldier, and get yourself cleaned up. Standards of hygiene must be maintained, Trenbow. - Probably a sign of fatigue, sir, don't you think? - At the casualty clearing station when you transfer, you'll find I run a tight ship. (puddles splashing) (gentle music) (soldier weeping) - These are all NYD's, sir. - They're what? - NYD's, sir. Nervous cases. Not Yet Diagnosed. Colonel Steele leaves them till last, sir. Cause they piss their pants. - Leave the diagnosis to me, Corporal. (bombs blasting in distance) What happened, Private? - Buried. Can't move. Can't move. (bombs blasting in distance) - Take these notes, Corporal. (bombs blasting in distance) Thighs semi-flexed. (soldier sobs nearby) Shoulder bent forward. (soldier sobbing nearby) Slurred speech. Repetition, muscular rigidity. Pupils dilated. No physical injury evident. Shell-shock. - Can't say that, sir. - Can't say what? - Shell-shock, sir. There's an order out from General Headquarters. - (scoffs) All right, put it down as nervous paralysis. Send him to field hospital. Recommended treatment: heat bath, eastern syrup three times daily. - With respect, sir, they won't take nerve cases at field hospital, unless they're really bonkers, sir. - Colonel Steele wants you to help him with the bandages, sir. - Tell him I'll be there shortly. - Trenbow! Dr. Trenbow, here, please. (bombs blasting in distance) There happens to be men with wounds needing attention. - Well, I have some cases of acute distress, sir. - Dr. Trenbow, those men are at that end because they are not wounded. - They need relief, sir. They're in pain. - Pain, Trenbow? - They need treatment, sir. (bombs blasting in distance) Er, give them some sedative doses. Dress their wounds if any. Paraldehyde, bromides, whatever you've got. - All of them, sir? - All of them. - Trenbow! - You sent for me, sir? - Corporal. And leave the magazine. Trenbow, you're a butcher. You've demonstrated that in the short time you've been with us. - Sir? - Your surgery is close to being downright criminal. - Well, I've never concealed my lack of experience, sir. - You're a butcher. - I've twice asked to be relieved of surgical duties, sir. - Your record shows that you're a medical risk. This is no suburban practice, Trenbow, where you can pass off your difficult cases. Lunatics and malingerers might be better suited to your talents. I'm having you transferred to a convalescent home in Britain where you can nursemaid cowards and other riffraff that want to shirk their responsibilities. Shell-shock. (scoffs) - I'd rather go back to the front, sir. Sir? - Tell the Corporal to come in, will you? (gentle music) (horn honking) (gentle music) - Admission? - Captain Trenbow, Australian Medical Corps. - I'm sorry, sir. We have a lot of officers here as patients and they're bunch of fritz loonies in transit, so you never know. (motorcycle rumbling) (gentle music) - Captain Trenbow. I'm to take up duties here. - Oh, no one takes up duties. - I'm sorry? - Well, how then does one take down duties? How does one take in the washing? - Could you direct me to the superintendent, please? - Sent a fox to keep the geese, eh? Bloody silly, eh? (cuckoo clock chiming) - Sorry, sir, I'll have to see identification. (knocks on door) Captain Trenbow reporting, sir. (door thuds shut) - Glass eye. Now, that's why I have security. Have tight security. Lost an eye once. Patient burst in on me and became violent. Well, I'm security conscious. All officers to carry sidearms in this hospital, standing orders. A few German patients are unpredictable. Oh, yes, er, your file. (clears throat) Er, how are things in France? - Don't know. - Yes. Now, I have Colonel Steele's report in front of me. Er... Won't conceal it from you. He seems to have reservations about your surgical ability. - I did ask to be relieved of surgical duties, sir. - We treat the mind here, not the scalp. Tell me, Trenbow, do you know much of the mind? - Well, frankly, sir, we didn't learn very much. They did show us the classic types of insanity one afternoon. - Ah, yes, the parade. See this, Trenbow? - What is it, sir? - One of the keys, Trenbow. One of the keys to the mind. This is a hookah. And through it, (exhales) you smoke hashish. Oh, well, we should be giving it to our patients, Trenbow! Either this or opium. One day, Trenbow, we may cure patients with a swallow of a tablet. Er, looking at your record, er... Er, you seem to excel at that new game, er, ping pong. Is that the game? Ping pong? - Yes, ping pong, yes. That's correct, sir. Well, there's not much competition at the moment, but I think it could be quite an important game. In my opinion. - Oh, really? - I didn't think it'd be on my record, sir. - University champion, Trenbow. And you'll have plenty of time here for ping pong. We can't do much for them. Any theories, Trenbow, on mental illness? - I suppose, sir, some men are just unsuited for warfare. I did think, from what I saw at the front, there could be, er, a sort of psychological screening of men. I thought-- - Unfortunately, Trenbow, to admit that would be killing off the fittest men, the healthiest. But what the army brass fears, of course, Trenbow, is that if we treat the mentally ill too softly, the whole army could be certified insane. That's what they worry about. - Treatments. There are none. (door thuds shut) Except the old blood and guts routine. Morphine, the old script. Split lone Aramic, three grains morphine, a quarter grain, repeat half hourly and send them back to the front. And so doped up they usually drown in their own vomit. Now, our Major Hook. Met him? Practices what he amusingly calls suggestion. He orders them to recover. - Hmm. I've used suggestion myself in a couple of cases. I think it can work. - There's a difference between a therapeutic suggestion and an order from Hook. He takes it as a personal insult if they don't get well. - What do you do? - I belong to the old-fashioned common sense school, known by Hook as pampering. Abundant diet. This is for shell-shock. Which, as you know, doesn't exist. Exercise, walk them round a bit, you know. Hot baths. Use massage for nervous spasm and rigidity. Struck that yet? - Hmm. - Do you know anything about hypnosis, Trenbow? Damned if I do. - No. No. What about the Super? What's his theory? - His theory is to lock himself in his room. It's Hook who runs the place. I suppose you're here for the same reason I am. Bad surgeon. - No. No, not exactly. Well... Frankly, yes. - (laughing) Good man. Ace ping pong player, though, I hear. Go through. (door thuds shut) - Oh, oh, Trenbow, I want you to meet Dr. Schneider of the German Army. And to take him into your custody. - Custody? - Well, we thought he'd be of more use practicing medicine than, er, sitting in a prison camp. Er, you can explain our program. - Our program, sir? - Well, maybe showing him the ping pong table. Oh, Dr. Schneider will be treated as an officer, a gentleman, and as a member of the medical profession at all times. - Very unusual situation. Drink? Er, are prisoners permitted to drink? - You are the gaoler. - Jailer. (patient shouting outside) Sorry. I'll take this down, I... It's rather poor taste. Just a souvenir. - You don't have to consider my sensibilities. I am the prisoner. Did you kill him? - Kill who? - The owner of the helmet. - Oh, heaven's no. I never fired a shot in anger. No, one of the men gave it to me. It's just a souvenir. - I will have a drink. (drinks pouring) Are you an alienist, doctor of the mind? - No, just an ordinary doctor. Graduated 18 months ago. The only reason I'm here is I'm a hopeless surgeon. - Sounds like the German army. In Berlin I was practicing as an alienist. Or as a psychiatrist, becoming a very, how to say it, fashionable word. In the army, I was treating dysentery. - A psychiatrist, huh? - You have read the works of your fellow Australian, Ellis? Havelock Ellis, the psychologist. - No, his books are banned. A couple of them were passed around the med school. But he's never really mentioned in polite society. Not even in medicine, for that manner. - Are any important ideas ever mentioned in polite society? And can there be polite medicine? (Trenbow chuckles) - Dr. Schneider, you're an older man, you've more experience than I. I don't really see how-- - My name is Karl, please. - Dr. Schnei- Karl, I don't really know how to handle a prisoner of war. I don't care for it either. I mean, I don't know, for instance, whether we should be chatting here as if we were in some club. You're supposed to be the enemy. (Karl chuckles) - Believe me, I am less at ease than you. After all, I'm the prisoner. I'm at a disadvantage. - Can't help feeling I'd be a better prisoner than I am a jailer. - Hey, come on, Gunter. Back to fritz quarters. - Now, look, this is very incomplete. It should say when he last ate, how often he takes solid food, what diet he's been on, it should have all these details. - Can't eat, sir. Hasn't eaten since they brought him in here. (patient retching) Does this all the time. (patient retching) - Tell us what happened. - I was running. (retches) - Go on. (patient retching) - I was running in an advance when they took us. (retching) I was running and I was picked up like a piece of paper. (patient retching) Thrown through the air. (retching) - Captain Avante says they we can start the game. (patient groans) - Go on, then. - I was just landed in the soft mesa. (retches) - Well, tell us, what was it? (patient retching) - Can't go on, sir. Can't go on! (retching) - Come on, Teddy. We can't start the tournament without the champion. - Now, look, Peter, I'm trying to treat this man. I'll be there later. (patient retching) I'm sorry, soldier, go on. - It was the body of a dead German with body blown open. (retching) Sorry, sir, I can't go on. I can't. (retching) (bomb blasts) (soldiers clamoring) (bombs blasting) (soldiers clamoring) (bombs blasting) - Shoot! (artillery blasting) (bomb blasting) - Poor old Jack, but look, that was years ago. - Now, look... - Well, Teddy, at last. How pleasant to see you once in a while. - Oh, yeah? - Karl. - Hello. - Tell the German to leave. He's still a POW. - Is that really necessary? - Captain Trenbow, tell the German to leave. - Oh, Dr. Schneider! A leading psychiatrist in his own country. Ah, gentlemen, Doctor Schneider. Oh, we hoped you'll join us for the, er, frivolity. - I would find it amusing, thank you. - Teddy, meet Captain Faulkner, one of the flying chaps. He says he's in the British Air Force, but he talks American. - I am American, all the way through. Please, call me Bill. Meet Lance Backhouse, correspondent. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Lance is going back to the front tomorrow. - Actually, I'm hoping to write a series of articles on shell-shock. - Mm-mm. Doesn't exist. (gentle music) - It is necessary to separate shock, the trauma, from the basic personality. Many men face mutilation and the horror better and do not break down. Why, then, we must ask, is this man different? Just go back to his childhood, Edward. - Can you really account for everything this way? - Well, clinical psychoanalysis certainly revealed that every time it's childhood and it's genital. - And you claim with this man the war is irrelevant. - The war, how do you say, triggered it. Just treat them as people, as individuals. - You know, frankly, I find these Freud theories perverse. - My friend, my colleague, your anger is also genital. Fear of sexuality. - Don't do that! - You all right, sir? - Yes, of course. Of course, I'm all right. It's quite unnecessary, Corporal. - I heard you shout. I though the Hun, the prisoner was trying something. - Dr. Schneider to you, Corporal. Finish that later. I'm damn sorry, Karl. Sorry about that. - It's understandable. (knocks on door) - Open up. (water running) - We have, then, the basis of Freudian psychology. The preponderant role of sexuality in human psychology including the psychology of the child and its relations to father and mother and to other children in the family. The existence of the unconscious mind which, unknown to us, governs our behaviors. The life of the child determines the life of the adult. (knocking at door) - Open up in there! (knocking at door) Open up or we'll break the door down! I know what's been going on here. Arrest this man. - How can you arrest a man who is already a prisoner? - Well, Teddy, you should realize by now, there's one thing the old medical profession doesn't want to know about. Sex. - I'm sorry now I ever did get mixed up in the damn thing. I don't know how I did. - I have you in my power. You cannot resist my evil influence. You will think of nothing but sex. (gentle music) - Well, Karl, at least we have this in common. - I appreciate you taking the risk. - You shared your knowledge with us. Even if the classes didn't get very far. - You know, Edward, it still comes to me as a shock to learn that men are not interested in truth. That trait, I venture, seems to be beyond belief. - Corporal. What do you think you're doing? - Your prisoner is trying to escape, sir. - You put that gun away, Corporal, and go home. - Stand clear. - Run for it, Karl, run for it. The man's crazy. - Go on, you Hun! Run! (guns firing) (dramatic music) (patients clamoring) - What's happened? - Captain, the war's over! (gentle music) - Hook wanted to court-martial me, but the Super wouldn't hear of it. He said I showed initiative. (Karl chuckles) - So it's back to Australia for you, Edward. - Yes, not immediately. All of the patients can't be moved. I don't think the medical corps will be demobilized for a while yet. - You know, I've got relatives in Australia, at a place called Germantown. - Mm-hm. Now called Holbrook for the patriotic reasons. - Maybe my relatives also changed their origin. But still, you never know. One day I may visit you. - Yes. Do that. - Will you specialize in psychiatry? - Maybe. Not Freudian psychiatry. I'm not convinced Freud's right. (winding gramophone) (bright music) (bell rings) - Never tell a patient the name of his complaint. If you tell him the medical name, he won't let go. Loves the sound of it. Makes him feel too important. - The longer the name of the illness, the bigger the fee. - The patient needs to feel a little self importance. It strengthens the ego. - Yeah, but, well, no one's moody anymore, it's called something fancy these days like clinical depression. - All this talk about ethics, dear. So challenging. - I see they're changing the name of the alienists to, erm, psychiatrists. Longer name, bigger fee principle, I suppose, Quentin. - Well, changing their name won't change the fact that they're all quite mad. Every one of them. - Well, Father, if that's the case, you're going to have a madman for a son-in-law. - I thought you were going to practice with your father, Edward. - Well, actually, I had some experience in France. - Damn it, Edward, that was the war. Hardly a thing for civilian practice. - Someone has to treat the poor devils, but I don't see why it should be you, Edward - You do it, Edward. Don't listen to these pot-stained money-grabbers. - Actually, it's a big field. It may be quite lucrative. I've looked into that. - You're not having another coffee. - No, no, dear, just the port. (woman laughs) - Edward says it's all the rage in America, psychoanalysis. - [Edward] I met a doctor in France who studied under Freud. - Freud? The sex doctor. Read something or other about him in the journal. Sounds a little smelly to me. - I happen to have read about Sigmund Freud. And what he says makes a lot of sense. If you'd paid a little more attention to your own children, Quentin, you might have learned something. - Mother, you amaze me. - Oh, she amazes all of us. She reads those plays by Bernard Shaw, too. And buys modern pictures. - I can't say I care for it all. Still, you won't be short of patients, I know that much. - Tell us about the wedding plans, Deborah. (clears throat) - At the signal, the organist will begin playing and you'll proceed down the aisle. Ready, Mr. Corrigan? (wedding march plays) - You weren't listening, Edward. - Hmm? Oh, I was. Yes, yes. Yes, I was. - After all, this is very important to us. - Very important. A ritual. Been reading about it. - It happens to be important for us, not that way. - Not becoming a swat, are you, Teddy? - Oh, he has his best of breeding. I'd rather he stick with his ping pong. (clears throat) - Shh. - Perhaps we could continue? - When it comes to the I do vow, I bet he'll probably come up with some psychological theory. - When the organist receives the signal, that will be the time for you to take up your positions. (bright music) - From Killary to an asylum. And so soon after the honeymoon. Edward! - It's all right, Deb. Mary's one of the patients. She'll help you around the house. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Trenbow, to scare you like that. - The old man's agreed for me to try out the fever cure. - Rather you than me. - What have I got to lose? - Oh, just a couple of patients. - Marion over in Pathology has lined up some malaria-infected blood. We pump it into a few syphilitics and see what happens. - I thought the old man wanted a quiet life. - Not going on the records, my dear chap. Not going on the records. Unless, of course, it's successful. Then we'll put it in the books. Trip to Edinburgh for me, boyo. Anyway, it's all been done in Europe. (strumming banjo) - Mother's been telling me all about Freud. - Why? - Because you won't. - Well, I'm not a Freudian. (strumming banjo) - What are you, then? (strums banjo) - I'm a banjo player. - You're not that either. Mother says that any modern person must be a Freudian. What are you, then? (knocking at door) Hmm? (knocking at door) (strumming banjo) There's an emergency over at the hospital. - The last time there was an emergency, it was Avante, wanted me to go to the club with him. - Something to do with malaria treatment. ♪ Nothing to do with me ♪ - One patient is dead already. - Well, there's no need to say already, Matron. (patient shuddering) Blanket. (patient shuddering) Did Dr. Avante leave any instructions? - He didn't. He took ill with appendicitis. He's now at RPA. - Well, has the director been informed? - Naturally. - Well, where is he? - He said to call you. I believe he's gone to his house in the Blue Mountains for a few days. - You can't talk to him, he'll be out for a couple of hours. - But, hell, I've got three patients dying and I can't find the reports. - Treat them for malaria, Teddy, that's what I'd do. (papers rustling) - But they are vastly improved from the malaria treatment. - Could relapse. They'll remain in this asylum for the rest of their lives as far as I'm concerned. At least until this matter blows over. You realize that this business will be included in the terms of the Royal Commission on Mental Health. - I didn't initiate the treatment. It was nothing to do with me. - But you will write the report on these experiments. I want them to be presented as scientifically planned and carried out. You alone treated and observed the patients. - It wasn't my idea. It was Avante's. - It has to appear that it was under control at the time. I don't give a damn, Trenbow. As long as the asylum is cleared of culpability. (dramatic music) - Damn it, Peter, I don't want to be lauded as a pioneer. I'm not a pioneer, you're the pioneer. - I'm happy for you to take the credit, Teddy. - You bastard. Did I tell you an old acquaintance of ours is coming home? - What's this old business? - Schneider. - Sigmund Freud himself. What's he coming here for? - Well, they gave him a professorship in Chicago, but there was trouble. They took it away again before it actually started. - You'd better put him under lock and key again, Teddy. It'll stir up a hornets nest in this colonial backwater. - Dr. Trenbow! Dr. Trenbow! Ah, there you are. Why do you do it, Trenbow? Why do you do it? For God's sake, Trenbow, we're not dentists. - There hasn't been a dentist near the place for years. - A century, perhaps. - The director general's been on to me. This is bound to come up with the Royal Commission. - Matron, we are aware that Dr. Trenbow is not a dental practitioner. Is there anything further you wish to tell the commission? - It might interest the commission to know that he, Dr. Trenbow, is a follower of Dr. Freud. I think this should be made pubic knowledge. - Doctor who? - Freud, the sex man. - I fail to see the bearing of that on this commission. - Well, it might interest this commission, but I agree that it hardly seems relevant. - My pardon must then deny it, Your Honor. - Have you yourself used or known of the use of the treatment fever therapy, as administered by Dr. Trenbow? - A little of proven value in the treatment of the mentally ill. A psychiatrist tries to use what he can. Provided it's medically sound, of course. Myself, I'd like to try hashish, marijuana as a treatment. Not possible. Not possible. - If we could return to the point. - Psychiatrist is the new word for those who specialize in treating the insane? - If I may clarify that, Your Honor, I am told by my learned colleagues in the medical profession that it is the new name for what we have previously known as alienists. - I still, er, see myself as an alienist, but yes, that is correct. - A rose by any other name, eh, Colonel? - But this fever therapy is still experimental? - Well, just about everything in this field is experimental. (bright music) - Edward, I want a word with you. What an old reactionary you pretend to be, denying everything in court. - You were the only one with advanced ideas around here, I'm afraid, Mrs. Tunis. - Well, you might be a little more adventurous. If only to humor me. (bright music) - Attention. Excuse me, everybody, attention, please. Attention. Yes, as we all know, a Royal Commission is going on today which concerns all of us here. Now, while I would not like to, er, make any comment on the outcome of this Royal Commission, a young man from the University of Sydney would like to make an announcement, which I feel sure will be of interest to all of us. - Isn't that, er, Dr. Sinclair's son? - Why, so it is. - A meeting of the undergraduate medical students of the University of Sydney last night passed a resolution, which I would like to read to you today. "While we endorse this long-awaited inquiry "into the antiquated treatment of the insane, "we deplore the unnecessary inquisition into the ideas "and methods of Dr. Trenbow. "Such an inquisition will only obstruct "the progress of science. "We wish to put on record our acclaim "of the work of Dr. Trenbow "in pioneering Freudian psychoanalysis in this country." - Three cheers! (all clapping) There you are, Edward. We've made you a Freudian. (all clapping) (wheel spinning) - 26 the winner! - I am sorry, sir, but we've given it to the newspapers, too. - Paul. - Oh, I'm sorry. Marguerite Saunders, Dr. Trenbow. - How do you do? - I wouldn't worry about being called a Freudian. It's bound to become fashionable. - We were told you studied under Dr. Freud in Germany. - Tell them how you shot one of our chaps defending him, Teddy. - Oh, for God's sake, Peter, this is serious. (band playing "Daisy Bell") (gentle piano music) - I arrive here and find you, Edward, spread across the front pages of the newspapers. - [Edward] Well, not by choice, Karl. - And you, a Freudian. Why, Deborah, back in England, he didn't want to accept the word of Freud. Isn't that right, Peter? Just a scientific conservative. - Well, really, Karl, I'm not a Freudian, despite what the papers say. In fact-- - Edward's father wants to sue for libel. - Oh, is it libelous to be a Freudian? - In this country? Decidedly. - Mother's furious. But then, she was a Freudian before Freud. - (laughing) Frankly, Karl, Freud is a dirty word here. - Freud would like that. I mean, you make what you're frightened of into an obscenity. - But surely, Edward, you would wish to associate yourself with progress, wouldn't you? - Look, Karl, I'm not a Freudian. It'll be hard to be thought of as one. All I want is to get out of this blasted Royal Commission without being de-registered. - Perhaps I could appear for you, try and do something to help, huh? - Well, thanks, yes. Eminent doctor, international reputation. Yes, I'm sure it would help. Don't you think so, Dad, Peter? - This blasted commission. It's all your fault, Peter, you know that. - Don't I know it. - You say, Professor, that there are many schools of psychiatry. - I do. - And which school of psychiatry do you follow, Professor? - I object, Your Honor, to the sneer put on the word "professor" by Mr. Sutphin. As he well knows, it is generally accepted, this form of address is rightfully used by a person who, at any time, has been professor, regardless of whether at present they are holding an academic post or not. - Mr. Sutphin, I suggest you address the witness with the respect due to him. - Yes, Your Honor. You seem not to have answered, Professor. Which school of psychiatry do you follow? - I practice psychoanalysis. - Not every psychiatrist practices psychoanalysis, I understand. - That's correct. It's one of many schools and methods of treatment. Although the ascendent one, if I may be permitted to boast. - And psychoanalysis is a form of treatment propounded by Dr. Freud. - Dr. Freud among others, yes. - Professor Schneider, would you say you are a Freudian? - I subscribe to the theories of Dr. Freud, yes. - Would it be true, Professor, to say that one of the teachings of Freud is that what we know as sexual perversions are, in fact, found in normal children? - If you like to put it in that simpler way, yes. - And that children have sexual feelings about their parents. - [Karl] Oh, most definitely. - Dr. Schneider, one last thing. Would you tell this commission your nationality? - German. - No further questions, Your Honor. - Well, that's all we needed. Terribly below the belt. - Sorry, I could see what the barrister was after, but there seemed to be no way of avoiding it. - Well, thanks anyway, Karl. - I wouldn't lose too much sleep. I dined with Judge Burpus last night. We didn't discuss the commission, of course, but he's very strong on protecting the professions from meddling busybodies. - You'll learn, Dr. Schneider, just how much of our British justice is a matter of class. - [Deborah] Mother's a Phoebean socialist this week. (all laugh) - However, I wish to stress that a certain conservatism is required of all professions, but most of all, medicine. A development should be a cautious and painstaking move forward rather than a gamble on bizarre experimental treatments. I find that Dr. Trenbow and Dr. Avante both base their treatments on sound accumulation of evidence from overseas sources and in no way are they guilty of negligence. I find it incumbent upon me to say something in reference to the allegations, or should I say, suggestions, that Dr. Trenbow or staff at the asylum were proponents of the teachings of Dr. Sigmund Freud. This falls outside the terms of this commission. However, I deem it a credit to the asylum that Dr. Trenbow and other staff have resisted these iniquitous teachings. Should they take hold in this country, I shall consider it a catastrophic degeneration of the medical profession. (upbeat jazz music) (glass shatters) (upbeat jazz music) (guests chattering) (upbeat jazz music) - All done with hypnosis. And superior play. Thank you. Thank you, partner. - You were magnificent. - Let's go and listen to the music. - Er, no, I'll go and find Edward. - Better make the most of it. There won't be any jazz bands in that one-horse town you're going to. - And there'll be no scandals, either. (upbeat jazz music) - Very adroit judgment, Your Honor. - Oh, really, dear. - One only followed the logic of the facts, my dear. The facts. (upbeat jazz music) (birds chirping) (upbeat jazz music) - I suppose you think going to the country's running away. - Now, why would I think a thing like that? - You have the wrong son-in-law, unfortunately. - Hardly. But really, psychiatry in the country? - Mother, that's enough. (horse nickers) (music playing nearby) (horse clopping) (brass band playing nearby) (children playing) (brass band playing) (clock ticking) (dart thuds) (telephone rings) - [Barman] Hello? Hang on a minute. Hey, Doc. Nurse Watson. - Tell her I'll finish up the game and come over. - Uh, he'll hurry right over, luv. - And I suggest you call round whenever it gets too bad or if you're feeling low. We know that sometimes the body speaks on behalf of the mind. - Thank you, Doctor. I'll think about what you said. - I'm only sorry there isn't more we can do, Mrs. Riley. - Goodbye. (motorcar rumbling) (Edward sighs) (knocking at door) - Come in. (door thuds shut) - Good afternoon, Dr. Trenbow. - You're not local, are you? - No, I'm from the city. Marguerite Saunders. - Just, er, passing through town, hm? - No. I motored down the coast. To consult you. - Oh, you flatter me. Occupation? Miss Saunders? - Yes, miss. Occupation? Whatever I feel like at the time. - Was I recommended to you? - No, I met you once, about 10 years ago. You were facing the inquiry. I was friendly with a young boy doing med. He read a motion about you at the asylum fete that day. Remember? - Yes. I remember the inquiry. I remember the student resolution and the problems it caused. - I was very much just a face. You were a medical celebrity. - Not really. Notoriety, perhaps. It seems a very long time ago. Anyhow, what can I do for you? - I want to be analyzed. - Psychoanalyzed? - Yes. - Well, I'm just a general practitioner. Leaving aside my qualifications, why do you want to be psychoanalyzed? - Oh... I thought it might be amusing. - I'm not an entertainer, you know. Would you care for a drink? - You're the first doctor ever to offer me a drink. Thank you. (glasses clink) - Have to be from medicine glasses. Nurse Watson disapproves. Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm sick. - Well, you look like a woman well in control of herself. - That's not the way my medical history reads. I drink too much. (sighs) With men, I'm unstable, to say the least. The clinical word is nymphomania, I believe. You understand Freudian theory? - Let's say, I recognize there are personality problems which make people ill. But you must realize I do very little psychiatric work, even though I make it a part of my practice. - I want to know about myself. Away from all the pressures of the city. - (clears throat) I'm just taking Miss Saunders over to casualty, Nurse Watson. - All right, Doctor, I'll close up now. (door thuds shut) - Wake up. - It's all right. We'll look after Doc. Lance! - You don't know who this man is. - I'm Lance Backhouse. I run the local paper. I'm an old friend of the Doc's. I'll see he gets home okay. - And I'm just a rich bitch from the big smoke. We can manage, thank you. - Now, look, I don't want to interfere, but, er... I'm an old pal of Teddy's. All right, thanks, Paddy. That a boy. Come on. Whoa. - Hey, I'll drive. - You point the car, I'll drive.

(Marguerite sobs) - Come on. Come on, come on. (Marguerite crying) She thinks she's in love with me. 'Course, it's nothing to do with me. It's transference. You know, you've read about it. - How long is it going to take? - It's hard to say. It's messier than in the books. - I never thought I'd have to live with it. Is she so excitable? - Well, I didn't want to get involved, but now I am, of course, I have to see it through. There's not only Marguerite, there's Dick Turner and there's the other two. - We wanted a quiet life. - Oh, I do. I do. I want a quiet life. - I just feel it's getting out of hand. - Well, thousands are out of work or can't sell their produce. They don't all take poison. - Maybe they'll end up doing that. - At least I hope I've convinced you. You're not alone in having problems. It hadn't been your fault. - I've always been one of those who feels he should be able to make a go of things, regardless of what's happening. Never had to make excuses. - Look, the depression isn't an excuse. It's a fact, it's reality. Maybe when you say, Marguerite, you're depressed about the sufferings of the unemployed, could it be there's a personal factor involved, rather than a political one? - Are you suggesting I'm not sincere about my political actions? - No, your political beliefs may be entirely justified. Only, they may not belong to you. Your altruism could be a symptom of the problem. - Rubbish! I don't accept that everything is part of the problem. - See, we sometimes involve ourselves in dramatic events such as politics as a way of expressing aggressions, hostilities, which we weren't permitted to express in our childhood. (door creaking) (crowd chattering) Yes. Yes, you would, if you had the money. That's the problem. (Lance laughs) - Er, we'd like to have a word with you, Doctor. - Is this a professional call, gentlemen? - I'd say so. - Oh, don't worry about him. Won't go any further than the front page. - We'd like some publicity for a scheme we've got. - Well, why don't we step into the bar. Would you care to join us, Mr. Backhouse? - Now, what we have in mind, Doc, is a town cooperative, run by the fishermen and the small farmers. - To get us a better price in the city. - I know nothing about these things. - The only answer is to put money into circulation. And that means massive government spending. - But we have to look after ourselves in the meantime. Now, look, you're a doctor and an officer in the war. We need the support of prominent townspeople. We intend to amalgamate our problems. Problems seem to be what we have plenty of. (crowd assenting) We can share cold storage, marketing facilities, transport. And we have plans for a cooperative store, where the townspeople and the unemployed can get food without a middle man taking his profit. (crowd clapping) Now, a couple of prominent townspeople have agreed to act as patrons for this cooperative. The, er, Reverend Lyle Smart of the Methodist Church. (crowd clapping) Physician and surgeon, Dr. Edward Trenbow, who is represented here tonight by his lovely wife Deborah. (crowd clapping) Now, uh, you all know me, Dick Turner, simple fisherman. Doug Wilson, farmer the Commonwealth Bank foreclosed on. And there's Phil Adams, a market gardener from Jericho Creek. Glen Morris, secretary of the Unemployed Relief Committee. Now, look, we're just ordinary people, but we've got to do something on our own because if those bludgers in Canberra just don't have a clue. (crowd clapping) (crowd chattering) - [Reverend] What a pity Teddy couldn't be here. - Oh, well, it was an emergency, it couldn't be helped. - Good evening, Mrs. Trenbow. - It was a good meeting. - It didn't go nearly far enough. - Well, we have to crawl before we can walk. - We should be marching. (drum beating) - Ah, thanks, George. There's the stuff about the march. - Good God, you've got that incident at my place in it. - [Lance] It shows them up for what they are. (Edward sighs) - Well, it's all getting very nasty. - Very nasty times. - Yeah, I thought... In fact, we both thought it would just be a matter of giving moral support. Maybe a bit of money. And I know Marguerite's looking for revolution, but... - Yeah. Look, she won't even talk to me. Yet, I mean, that first night she came here... Christ! Right here. Now she won't even pass me the time of day. - Hmm, well, she's neurotic. I think you'd better leave it alone, Mr. Backhouse. You might just aggravate her symptoms. (birds chirping) (truck rumbling) (festive music) (car door slams) - Need any help? - Oh, no, thanks, Lance, we're quite capable. Oh, we might need help later when the unemployed drift in. - All right. (festive music) (drum beating) (festive music) (drum beating) (festive music) (drum beating) (children playing) (festive music) (drum beating) - You'll have to clear the grounds! We'll give you 15 minutes to disperse. - The cooperative has every right to use the showground. - You have no right to use it for political purposes. - You haven't got any authority around here, Peterson. - I represent the decent people in this town! - Come off it, Peterson, you couldn't even represent the Boy Scouts. - Are you going to move or not? - [Man] If you don't get out of here, we'll move you. - All right, men, clear those tables away. (all chattering) (all clamoring) (festive music) - Better lend a hand, Doc. (all clamoring) (china shattering) (festive music) (motorcar rumbling) (all clamoring) (motorcar rumbling) - Shoo, shoo! (all clamoring) (gun fires) - All right, all right! All right, Sergeant. We were trying to restore order. - [Sergeant] I'll look after law and order in this town. - Very well, Sergeant. We'll leave it in your hands. Fall in, men! (horse nickers) (drum beating) (festive music) (crowd cheering) - Thanks, Harry. - Don't like anyone trying to do my job for me. Anyway, they've cut me pay by 10%. (festive music) (gentle piano music) - You seem distracted. - Oh, I'm sorry. Please go on. - You weren't listening. - Yes. No, I'm sorry, I was distracted. You'll be pleased. I'm being called a Communist now. - They're hysterical. - Oh, yes. Everyone's acutely hysterical. So one must expect irrational behavior. That's interesting. - What's interesting? - You're talking to me as an equal. - Are you criticizing me? - Well, when we first started, you'd have said, "I'm sorry," fuming on the inside. Or you'd have said aggressively, "Why shouldn't I? "You're just a doctor." Or you'd have thrown stones at my house. (Marguerite laughs) - Hadn't really noticed. - Yeah, I think we've progressed. - Yes, I think we have. - Do you really think so? - I do. - Well, what do you know? - It's taken long enough. - Yes, there's a lot of controversy about how long analysis should take. (gentle piano music) - I've been meaning to suggest fewer appointments. (gentle piano music) - Damn it, Trenbow, we don't want to interfere in your practice. But in the medical fraternity, we feel you should stay clear of political controversy. - Unless you're a conservative member of Parliament. - It's unethical, Trenbow. - Well, I can assure you gentlemen it hasn't brought me any financial benefit. - We're willing to overlook the other hocus pocus you go on with. - Psychoanalysis. - But we must insist, Trenbow, that you drop this political business, or we'll have to consider going to the BMA. - If you insist. I'll tender my resignation as patron. - I think that's sensible, Trenbow. - You'll stay and have another drink? No hard feelings. (metal clangs) (insects chirping) - If it's Mother you're worried about, there's no need to be. I finally talked her out of coming. I told her our cooperative couldn't cope with her eccentricities. - I have got to resign as patron of the co-op. - Why? (metal clanks) - The medical fraternity thinks I've gone too far. - In what way? - The psychoanalysis was one thing, but to them, the co-op is dangerous politics. - You'll be letting a lot of people down. - I was only really a figurehead at the co-op. They'll manage without me. - I'd rather not give in. - Well, it's not a question of giving in. Medicine's my real interest, after all. - Psychoanalysis, you mean. - I suppose so. - Well, Mother, at least, will be pleased. (insects chirping) (motorcar rumbling) - [Newsboy] Extra! World War comes to the States! Daily Mirror! Get your Mirror! Extra! - Mrs. Smedley-Jones? - For three quarters of an hour. - Was she hysterical? - I would say violent. - Uh-oh. (gentle music) - I saw the commanding officer about you and I think he'll do his best. Tomorrow I'll see the Minister, go to the BMA. - I seem to remember a similar situation about 20 years ago. Was it 20 years? - I'm not the jailer this time. - I wish you were, Edward. The madness of history makes a joke of our profession. - But you are now in the Minister's personal staff, Marguerite. Why don't you pull a few strings to get him out? - Too risky to be taking up this sort of thing. We could all end up in the internment camp. - It would be politically inadvisable. I hope you can see that. - Well, surely the new Labour government has some sane ideas. - Ha! - You never have acknowledged the logic of situations, Edward. It's not politically prudent. - Now my ex-patients preach to me about prudence. You drummed up the country into an anti-German hysteria. Now you've fallen a victim to your own psychological propaganda. - Keep your equilibrium, Teddy. - The Germans are the enemy, Edward. You should be thankful Schneider is alive. - [Man On Radio] As soon as I heard last night that Japan had attacked the United States... - Naturally, you'll have to do something to help Schneider. - I owe him so much. The rotten thing is they put anyone, anyone who's German into these interment camps. They don't even consider special cases. - Maybe there's nothing you can do. - [Man On Radio] And later on it was announced from Tokyo that the Japanese high command, not the Imperial Japanese Government, the Japanese high command has declared that a state of war existed with Great Britain and the United States. - Hey, Dad. I was listening to that. - Sorry. (radio clicks on) - They are authorized an immediate declaration of war upon Japan.

Okay. - Amazing. - It is. By the way, Teddy, tonight some of the American brass are coming round to my place. Drinks and so on. Why don't you drop in? - I have to do that broadcast for the ABC tonight. - Well, come afterwards. And remember, Teddy, the Germans are the baddies. (xylophone ringing) - This is the Australian Broadcasting Commission. 2FC Sydney. The time is a quarter past seven. Good evening. In the studio this evening, we have Dr. Edward Trenbow, a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and a pioneer in this field in Australia. Dr. Trenbow. - Keep your hand on that switch. He's supposed to be a little unpredictable-- - Before I go on to discuss the brief, but dramatic history of psychiatry in Australia between the wars, I want to raise another issue, to make a protest on behalf of a fellow member of our profession, who is at present in internment. Dr. Schneider is of German birth, however, he has been living and practicing medicine here in Australia for the past 20 years. He is a true man of science. (gentle music playing) - [Man] Well, I suppose I'd better go and tell the nutty professor he's been given the chop. - Better you than me. - Although still subject to hysterical suspicion to conservative members of the medical profession and to the general public... (gentle music playing) - We must apologize, ladies and gentlemen, for this interruption to the talk by Dr. Trenbow. We're trying to find the fault and we'll rectify it as soon as we can. Meantime, we will continue with music. (gentle music playing) (jazz music) - Is it dry? - Oh, dry as dust, Lieutenant. - Lieutenant. - Lieutenant. - That's right. (jazz music) (woman laughing) Fine. - A slice of pineapple's good. (jazz music) If you're from California, Lieutenant, what were you doing there? - Oh, I was in showbiz, as they say. - Were you? - Yes, and then I got fed up with the rat race and decided to serve my country. - Teddy! Good man. Scotch? - Yeah. (jazz music) Nice. (jazz music) (guests laughing) (jazz music) - Put that gut out. Have a real cigarette. - [Man] Why, thank you, mate. Very kind of you. (jazz music) - Hey, Aussie. You and us are gonna win this war. - It's not my war. (jazz music) - What's wrong with your friend? - Teddy's remaining neutral in this war. - I didn't think anyone was allowed to be neutral. - A joke. In poor taste, my dear. (motorcar rumbling) (car doors slamming) ("God Save the King" on piano) - The Attorney General under the National Security Act herewith prohibits this meeting of the Australia First Movement. This meeting is therefore illegal. You two men are under arrest. (blow lands) The rest of you will give your names to my men. - My name is Syme. I'm a barrister at law. This action is entirely illegal. As I understand it, this is a democracy. - I have my instructions. And they come right from the top. - Erm... Edward Trenbow, 14 Everett Crescent, Sandy Bay. - Morning, Doctor. - Morning. - Ha. How do you do it, Teddy? - Rodney severed diplomatic relations with me this morning. - I tell you, Teddy, down at the club they're not laughing at my jokes about you anymore. - If things keep going as they are, I'll end up in prison with Schneider. (knocking at door) - Mrs. Smedley-Jones, Dr. Avante. (door thuds shut) - I hope Edward won't be long. - No use waiting for him. - It's an irony, Deborah. He can help others with their problems, but he never sees his own. - If he doesn't stop, he'll be in prison with Schneider. He's behaving like a traitor. - That's not fair. He's behaving like a friend, Rodney. - The stupid thing is he's never really been the least interested in politics. - I rather admire Edward, in a sad sort of way. At least I take some credit for turning him into a Freudian. - Uh, I'll have one, too, Rodney. (motorcar rumbling) (car doors slamming) (knocking at door) (jazzy music) - What the hell? They can't do this. (jazzy music) You're responsible. (jazzy music) - What's going on in this country? You must have known they were going to raid the house. - I'm sorry, Edward. You shouldn't be here. There's nothing I can do. - [Edward] Even on the basis of friendship? - I find it hard to talk in terms of friendship with someone who is against the war effort. - I'm not against the war effort. It's just I've seen this hysterical anti-German feeling before. I'm not going to turn against Schneider. - You've been drinking. Show Dr. Trenbow out, please. - This way, sir. - I'd rather you didn't try to see me again. There's nothing I can do. (door thuds) (motorcar rumbling) (car door slams) (motorcar rumbling) (fanfare music) (birds calling) (fanfare music) - [Narrator] A Superfortress bomber brings Allied commander of all South Pacific forces, General Douglas MacArthur to Canberra. The General is warmly greeted by Prime Minister Curtin and members of the war cabinet. (dramatic music) In the nation's capital for talks on the war and a dinner in his honor, we recall when the General first visited New Guinea. A Jeep for the General. With him, commander of land forces, General Thomas Blamey. An Australian driver pilots the commanders along the jungle road. A simple soldier's lunch. The General shares a mug of tea with the men. (dramatic music) On his tour, MacArthur inspects frontline troops, sturdy fighters who are repulsing the Nip invaders. (gentle piano music) - He sails on Wednesday. (gentle piano music) (jazzy music)
