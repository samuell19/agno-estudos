Two dozen eggs for 57 cordobas. Get your two dozen eggs for only 57 cordobas. Safe! Now the gang's playing with the police? It's a friendly game. Maybe it'll get the kids off the streets. Smash it! Hit a home run! This is a broadcast by Estrella Eggs. The pitcher's on the mound. The batter steps up to the plate. The pitcher takes aim, throws and... He hits it high into left field! It's coming down, down... The ball hits the ground! There's a run for home base. A run for second. The second baseman catches the ball. But he's safe! The score is now 4 to 5. This broadcast is courtesy of Estrella Eggs. Only 57 cordobas for a crate of two dozen quality eggs. Tension's mounting on the field! Tempers are raging! He's already blind. Now you want a leg? Hey, man! Aim at the catcher, not me! You pitch like shit! You scared? - Get your shit together! Or else! You wanna fight? That uniform don't scare me! I'll kick your ass. All hell's breaking loose. The cops wanna rough the punk up. Once a punk, always a punk! What's your problem? Beat it, asshole! You scumbag! Degenerates! You dumb bastards, quit breaking my eggs! You're strung out. You just get here and already you're on my case. That's my sweatshirt. - Chill out. Take your damn shirt. I couldn't get two cents for it! Mom's not home yet? - Nope. And the kids? Did you eat yet? Not yet. I made beans but we're outta rice and tortillas. Send him to the store. With what? Mom didn't leave any money. Damn. I need money for tortillas. Who do you think I am? Your old man? You're not even my woman. I'd rather rot in hell! We need cash. Let's sell that CD player. Hey, Chino. What's up, babe? Where you been? I thought we were celebrating. I had to go home to check on the kids. You saw us beat the cops! Your little show was really dumb. We almost lost! That was no show. That asshole almost split my head open. Skinny, I need a favor. What do you need? Somebody to buy a CD player. But on the sly. You gotta be kidding. Think it over. You'll get a cut. By when? - Right away. We wanna celebrate. I'm going to the gym. And I'm pissed at Mom's moocher boyfriend. I told you I'd take care of that bastard. Just say the word. I'm outta here. See you later? I'll wait for you tonight. - Okay. Hey, skinny, don't forget our business. How much you want? - Two bills. You know the score. No problem, bro. Do right by us. - Sure, man. Is Yader here? - In there. Yader, you got company! So? I didn't think you'd show today. Are you crazy, man? I'm so bummed out. I gotta get rid of all this fire in my gut. Things are fucked at home. Then you need to work out. I got you a spot with Polvorita at the municipal gym. No kidding? Me and Polvorita? Yup. Yader, you're the coolest. No shit! Okay, go work out. Woah, man, you're a real Charles Atlas! What's up with you? Just stopped to say hi. Long time no see. Now that you're a big shot businessman. You gotta choose a path. That doesn't mean you have to drop out. You don't hang out, you don't party. You don't talk to nobody. You're so full of shit. Aren't we talking? You're just here on your shady business. I stop by, nice and friendly, and you call me shady! I'm cool. You're the one who's touchy. So you know you're still my bro, I brought you a little gift. Slip me twenty pesos. I'm not into that. I don't get it. Okay, we're bros. What's partying got to do with it? Hey, if you need me, you know where to find me. Boy! You're really wired! Take it easy, you'll burn out. Hey, princess, you got a peso? Sorry, man. I'm broke. Okay, then, doll face. Here's the gang chick. Don't start. I'm in no mood. Scarlett says you can start work at the shop tomorrow. I can't tomorrow, I'm busy. Busy doing what? I'm not supporting you forever! How about getting that bum a job? Mind your own business. Tell him that! Alfonso, turn that thing down. I'll tame that wild beast. Not now. I know what this bitch needs. Wow, sexy! Don't mess with me. Your little girl's a woman. Eat shit. If you use water, fill the buckets. What time do I start at Scarlett's? 8:30. Okay, but I'm leaving at 4. I have an appointment. If they haggle, drop the price 2 cordobas. If it's under 50 cordobas, don't even think about offering a discount. These clothes are 100% American. On three pieces, they get a 5-cordoba discount. If you have the slightest doubt, just ask me, okay? Another thing. Watch out for our shoplifter friends. Got it? - Got it. What's with that face? Smile or you'll scare off my customers. Ma'am, I have to leave at 4 today. Where do you get off asking for favors? You just started work. Scarlett? - Yes? Telephone. - Be right there. I'm so embarrassed to bother the neighbors. But they ripped off the phone line. You're in charge. We'll talk more later. Somebody, grab him! Grab him! Can't you see I'm working? I just wanna see something. Shit, they erased the file! What file? These computers are a mess! Perfect timing! I didn't have time to take cover. See you later. - Good luck. It's the working girl! You got mugged? A guy stole my backpack with the disk and all my work. You sound like a peon. They kill off their father, mother, brothers. They claim their kids are sick. They'll make up anything to get out of work. Not me. I'm responsible. Okay. You've got till tomorrow. Use your hook! Come on. Come on! Jab! Defend yourself! Give him a left hook. Keep working, come on. Box. Stay in close. Let's see your left hook. A one-two combo. Time out. How's it going? - Fine. This is the girl I told you about. I trained her, now she needs you. Let's see her stuff. Your name? Yuma. Change and warm up with the girls. Then I'll put you in the ring. Today? - Sure. He says you've got talent. Let's see. She's a little nervous but she's good. She's spunky. They're all like that at first. Leave it to me. Straighten up. Use your hips. Keep your fist up. No, man, I only take cash. Sell it and bring me the bread. Help me out, bro. Three rocks. I'll pay up tomorrow. Tomorrow, without fail. Miss. Do you have this in a smaller size? No, just what you see. Okay, then. You have to be nicer. Talk to the customers, make suggestions. Can't you see how stiff you are? Making a sale takes charm! Hey! Where's your head? You're like a zombie. You act weird. That makes them nervous. I don't know. You should fix yourself up. You're a pretty girl. Wear something sexy. Ma'am, I need a favor. Can I take a break at noon? I have something to take care of. Every day it's a new story! That's two for two. You left early yesterday, and now today. It seems you don't want a job. This can't go on. Just for today. Really. My God, what am I gonna do with this girl? Have it your way. Go work. But forget about this weekend. I'm busy. Samantha, let's go. Are you Ernesto? Yeah, why? My name's Yuma. And so? I have something of yours. Is this a game? Watch out or I'll tell. What's this fucker's problem? Take it easy. So what do you have of mine? I found this in the street. Hey! Where'd you find it? - I just said, in the street. I'm no thief. Toss it if you want. No, that's not it. I'm sorry. Can I buy you a drink? No, thanks. - Don't go. I'd like to thank you. You saved my life. Look, there's a bar. We can sit down, shoo the flies away and share a soda in peace. Okay. Have a seat. I'll get the drinks. We're planning to go today. We can drive there. I'll get the car. Okay, but not the gas. You're like an angel from heaven. How did you find me? All your contact information is on the disk. Yeah, but how did you recognize me? One of your jerky friends said, «Hey, Ernesto.» Otherwise, I was just gonna leave it somewhere. What's so important on it? It's not a music CD. It's used in a computer... Take it easy, boss. You think I'm an idiot? I'm sorry. - It's okay. Like I even care! Look, I study journalism. This is my first newspaper article. My backpack got ripped off and my deadline's tomorrow. I was about to start from scratch. What's it about? - Health workers. Is that a good job? Lots of work, not much money. Why? Are you interested? No, thanks. I've got other plans. Yeah? What do you do? I'm a boxer. - No kidding! When does it come out? - Friday, in El Nuevo Diario. Bye. - Wait. Can I see you again? How can I find you? I train at the municipal gym. Every afternoon. See ya. And here's the little salesgirl! Don't talk like that. She's taking me out on pay day. Right, doll? You're crazy. Get a job. Now she's into USA shit. Used shit's more like it! Use me! Fuck off! I'm just workin' to cover my boxing expenses. You still into that? Women don't box. Yader's just blowin' smoke up your ass! What's it to you? You're so fuckin' yesterday! Hey, go fight at home! Shut up, you! Butt out! Yader just wants to get into her pants. He acts like a saint 'cause he quit drugs but he's just a degenerate. He moonlights as a stripper. The son of a bitch dances naked and drives the women wild! Buck naked! That guy's some kinda queer. No joke! You're a bunch of assholes. - Take it easy. You're gettin' heavy on me. Watch your step. I see you spying on me! Now you guys are gonna get a beating. Come on. Go to bed. You think I'm funny? Use both hands. Faster. Stay in close, keep jabbing. Get inside. Keep working. Use your technique. That's it, girls. Hi. No wonder you were distracted! Is this your boyfriend? What boyfriend? He's a friend. I'll introduce you. Ernesto, nice to meet you. - Guillermo. Ready to defend yourself? I actually came in peace. Don't get caught off guard! What a surprise! I wanted to take you out. Give me a minute to change. Okay. Be right back. Hey, there. Hey, Ernesto! What's up? Come sit with us. Maybe later. We're gonna sit over there. Okay, go for it. The night is young. Your buddies keep you on a short leash. They're just jealous. Two beers. So, it's confirmed. My first article comes out tomorrow. I owe that to you, in part. Don't exaggerate. - No, seriously. I'm grateful. - It was no big deal. Not so much for the CD. But for the opportunity to meet you. Yeah? And what do you see in me? An unusual girl. What do you mean by that? I've never met a girl like you. You're so... - So what? So wired. Why are you so defensive? I asked you out to get to know you. That's all. Look, let me tell you something. It pisses me off when people take me for a fool. What are you after? Your friends make fun of me. Besides, you've got a girl. I saw her on campus. What do you want with me? Then you come out with this «unusual girl» shit. You think I'm gonna melt over that romantic slop? You use more than fists for defense. Forget it. That's okay! You put your cards on the table. I'll be frank with you. You're absolutely right. I am a dumb romantic. And my friends are assholes. And if my girlfriend sees us, she'll scratch my eyes out. But for some reason I'm attracted to you. Thanks for the beer. - You're welcome. Wait. When can I see you again? Now. No way. If that guy comes near me, I'll cut him. This is good shit but we're out. Let's go get some more. I could beat the shit outta him. - Beat the shit... outta him. Hey, bro, where you been? I was doing an... errand. I see you guys are all wasted tonight. You're looking good, Yumita. How about a little toke to get up to our level? I don't do that shit anymore. Don't be puttin' us down. Come with me to buy more. Guapo can go with you. What's the matter with you, sweetie? Forget it, man, she's a saint now. No, I'm an athlete, bro. Leave her alone. Come on, Chino. Hey, Gato, stay with Yuma. You smoking? Your bro's staying. You staying with Yuma? - Yeah! We're high. Yeah, I saw that. Even you're fucked up. One of these days, I'm gettin' outta here. Really? Come on, bastards! What's your problem, shit head? You faggots! Come on, if you got balls! What's going on? - They're messin' with us. Then why are you running away from them? Bastards! They'll pummel the house to bits. Call the police! The cops are our friends! We'll kill you, faggot! They've got a gun! Get in here! Hey, girlfriend! You gone intellectual now? What's up, cutie? I'm just reading my horoscope. It says, «A surprise encounter will change your life.» Careful it's not with the cops! - What? I'm not into that shit anymore. Just a warning. Culebra says you're losing your nerve. Tell him to stop bad-mouthing me. He's still pissed at you. I don't take orders from him. He's hot for you. - That's his problem. What's up with you these days? Are you really training with Polvorita? You bet I am! You're just asking for trouble there. If I had your looks, I'd avoid black eyes. You're just as silly as they are. You crazy girl. That's nasty. Thanks for straightening those. They turned the place upside down yesterday then didn't buy a thing. I was just looking for this. Ma'am, can I borrow it tonight? I'll bring it back Monday. Please. No way. If you want it, buy it. That's the rule. You haven't paid me yet. I'm broke. I was invited to a party and I wanna look sexy, like you said. Good Lord, you look like a girl in love! Okay, just this once. But bring it back on Monday. Laundered. Without fail. What a girl! Ma'am, could you do me a favor? Another one! I'd like an advance on my salary. Control. Find an opening. Precision. Stop. How do you feel? Fine. Take a deep breath. I'm sorry. It's okay. I didn't mean to. It's okay. Put some ice on it so it doesn't swell. Are you alright? I really didn't mean to. It's okay. But why'd it have to be today? I thought you weren't coming. Sorry. I just got through. You look terrific. What happened? - Nothing. Look at me. Who did that to you? Better get used to it! Let go or they'll think you hit me. Man, that's all we need. Hey, Erick. Looks like it's getting serious! Lay off. I'd like you to meet Yuma. Nice to meet you, Yuma. You've got this guy bewitched. I've never seen him like this. Cut it out. - Take it easy. The concert's great. - Aren't you coming? Catch you later. If three's not a crowd! Thank you! And now we have for you... «Nica in Costa Rica.» Why'd you wanna leave? Too many people. I'd rather be with you. Where you taking me? That'll be fifty. Thank you. - You're welcome. So... You gonna tell me how you got that shiner? Listen, there's no reason to hide these things. Women have rights. If somebody hit you, file charges with the women's police. I told you I was a boxer but you never believe me. Now girls are boxing? What'll it be next? What brings you here? What's up? How are you? Fine and you? Fine. I heard you got hit. It was my fault. I wasn't concentrating. Let's see. She got you good. So you really do box? - See? You never believe me. Ask him. He got me started. Are you a boxing coach? I have a gym. It's small but I get by. That's what I figured, with that build of yours. He dances at a club, too. - Really? Yeah. - Interesting. Where's the club? Yuma knows it. Come whenever you like. Really? - I'd be happy to go with you, if it's your treat! No way. It's on me. Let me know, I'll leave tickets at the door. How about this weekend? No, I can't this weekend. I'm going to the beach. Shit! Some adventure! Come in! What's the problem? It scares me. Why? I can't swim. You didn't say you'd never seen the ocean. You never asked. You're so secretive. You never talk about yourself. What do you wanna know? Neither do you. Tell me something. Like what? - I don't know. I guess you have a family. Yeah. I have two younger sisters. We live with my mom. My dad's in Miami. He sends us money for school. In Miami! That's bitchin'! You can get outta here. What do you mean? I like it here. Man, are you weird! I'd give anything for a visa to get away from this shit! What's so great about this place? This is my country. I was born and raised here. My dad took off but my mom stayed. She raised us to feel like we belong to this land. Only you could believe in that. And you? Why do you fight? Why box? Because I like it. Well, I don't. You don't like boxing? I don't like to see you get hurt. Don't get all romantic, man. I don't like being babied. Okay, then, let's fight. You're on! - Okay. Eggs! Two dozen eggs for 58 cordobas. Hey, stuck-up! What's up, girlfriend? Give me a hug. How's tricks? So, so. I won't make a million but it beats a sweatshop. I hear you were gone all weekend. Your mom was pissed. She turned the barrio upside down. My mom? When I'm home, she's always on my case. Now she'll throw a fit. She even went after Culebra. She thought you took off with him. I saw him. He's really jealous. Gimme a break! So where'd you go? I hardly recognize you. I went to the beach. So how was it? The beach? - Not the beach, you ninny! Him! What's he like? To die for. But mum's the word. You know me! My lips are sealed. Just watch your back, girlfriend. Don't worry. I can take care of myself. See ya. It's about time! Where have you been all weekend? That running around's ruining your reputation. Where are the kids? In school. How about handing over your pay? To spend it on that lush? Watch your mouth. I'm your mother! Yuma, you got company. What happened to you? - Nothing. Why? You were gone all weekend. We figured something happened. Nothing happened. What a bunch of lowlifes. You got nothing to say? What do you want me to say? Boy, are you touchy! I don't know what you wanna hear. You want me to say it? Go ahead. Hey, I'm the one who should be pissed off. Oh, yeah? What about? You take off without a word. - I don't have to report to you. You're my woman. Remember? Nobody owns me. I do what I damn well please. They boss me around at home. Then you start in with this shit! Let's not fight. Just tell me the truth. Are you with someone? - None of your business. It's Yader, isn't it? I just want to know. It's not Yader. Who is it? - What's it to you? So you admit there's someone. I'm sick of you all. I'd be better off in hell! If I find out, I'll beat the shit outta him. Let's go, guys! So? What's up? - You alone? Yeah, man. Is Down checkin' things out? Yeah, he'll be back soon. Don't freeze up like Gato. What's with you? No, Gato's checking out something for me. Here I am! Told you he'd be back. So what time does the truck pass by? At 4. Okay, we'll send Down over to distract them. Know what to do? You sure? - Yeah. He'll screw it up. No, he knows what to do. We still need a gun. Chino, swipe your mom's pistol. No way, man. Not my mom's. Another wimp. I'll get the pistol. So, we're on. Cut it out, man. See you later? Okay. Where? - Got enough for a motel? No, come to my house. You're crazy. Why'd you say that? Don't get upset. But you're too romantic. Is that why you're ashamed of me? Don't be silly. It's that fag with the backpack. Backpack? What're you talking about? Pay up, then I'll tell you. What are you doing? Making cutouts? Yeah, right. Go to sleep. So you're back? - What do you want? Lights out. Don't waste electricity. You don't pay for it. Fuck off. Where'd you go? For a glass of water. I'm all alone in bed. I'll give you what you want, bitch. Calm down. I'm here. I wanna die. It's a scorcher! We haven't seen your friend in a while. What friend? That hunk who stopped by the other day. Yader? - Yeah, him. I don't see him much now that I train at the gym. Why? He did invite us to see his show. Business is dead today. We could close up early and drop by. Okay. He does have a show today. Let's go! - You're on. But I should go tell my mom. You know how she is. Good idea. Go tell her so she doesn't worry. You can leave early and I'll meet you there. You know the place? The little chick... The little chick's all gone. It's been sold. All gone? - All gone. Poor little chickie. Where'd you find this retard? Who knows? He's into little chickies. Little chickies? You like chickies? They get gobbled up. We're gonna eat it up. Want some? Poor little chickie! Gimme the cash. What do we do with the chickens? Grab a few? - Forget it! Come on! The cops, man! Quit fucking around! Go, go, go! Faster, man! Move it! Sorry, this seat is taken. How have you been? Fine. Until I ran into you. Fuckin' shit! How close are they? Shut up and drive! Chickens! Chickens! Get your chickens! Chickens! Free chickens! Watch out! Get outta the way! Hey, kids, free chickens! Fuckin' cops! Outta the way! I'm not an idiot. I know you're seeing somebody else. Turn around! Turn your back to me! Drop the gun! Go, handsome! Shake it, baby! Leave him alone! Let me go! Help! Let me go! Help! You idiot! Not the girl. - She was screaming. Let's go! - Wait! How does Yuma's pretty boy look now? Gimme the watch, asshole! Gloria. Sweetheart. It's okay. Cold water! I'll take one. Okay, girls. That's enough for today. That was much better. We're ready for next week. You sure I'll get to fight? - Sure. I always was. Just knuckle down the next few days. Affirmative. How do you feel? - Excited. How's it going? What happened? - Don't you know? Who did that to you? - Look... Stop playing innocent! I see your game now. Did you all have fun? You're really into violence! That's all you know! Out and out violence! Damn it! I was the perfect patsy. You had it all planned. «I happened to find this. A disk with your name on it.» «I just happened to...» You really played me. How many guys have you fucked for a watch, a backpack? But I wasn't enough! You had to beat up Gloria, too. Why? What did we do to you? Now I see who you are. I can't believe I fell for it. Get outta my life. You're worthless. Worthless! You fuckin' troublemaker. You fuckin' make me sick! Stop, he's your brother. This bastard's always made my life hell! I know what you did, asshole. This is Ernesto's watch. You're back. You're crazy. But here you are. You're back. In your dreams. Why'd you do it? Do what? - You know what! I did you a favor. - What the fuck? That guy was cheating on you. He's got another girl. Who do you think you are? - Thief of the year. Don't you read the papers? You're sick. You killed a cop. He had four kids. You'll get 30 years. They'll never catch me. Come with me to Costa Rica. We can start over. How you gonna get there like that? I've got money. Once I get this bullet out... They got Chino. The fucker better not squeal. - How can you talk like that? Do you despise me? Huh, Yumita? Yes. Okay. So it's over. Let's go. Yumita! Here, take this. Give it to Chino's mom. Our next fight is in the women's boxing category. In this corner, making her professional debut, we have Virginia «La Yuma» Roa! And in this corner, the champ, with ten wins and one defeat, Nohemi «La Brava» Reyes! Come to the center. We'll go four rounds. A nice clean fight, all rules apply. Any questions? May the best woman win. To your corners. Ready? Go! Cool her off. You okay? We can't lose. You're throwing some good hooks. But she's tall. Move in closer. You're the champ. Coaches out of the ring! Round over! Yuma, you've got her. Stay with the upper cut combinations. Stay on top of her! Take a deep breath. Let it out. Give to her, Yuma! You can do it! Harder! Keep it up! Ten seconds! Round over! Back to your corners. The results. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner in the female category is... Yuma, «The Wildcat»! Great job, kid! Our next contest... Maria Lourdes «La Tica» Cortes... and Lisseth «The Lioness» Garcia. Congratulations, girl! My heart was in my throat! You were awesome! What about me? Hey, girlie! You whipped her ass! You know about that already? Hey, baby, we're plugged in! You're the pride of the barrio. We're gonna celebrate. How about a few coins for a little rum? You're famous now! - Famous but broke. Next time. What's he doing outside? Where's Marjurie? Inside. And Alfonso? He's in there, too. Is Mom home? - Dunno. Wait here. Stay with him, please. Have you fucking gone crazy? Where's Marjurie? - How do I know? I'm not her father. I'm gonna report you! - Really? I'll report you, too. For aiding and abetting. There's a killer on the loose. You're in cahoots. I'm not scared of you. - Oh, no? You wanna fight? - Drop that shit and let's go. Fuck him! Let's take the kids. What a pair of queers! Faggie pig, Mommy pig and baby piglets! Get the kids ready for bed, honey. The house may be small but nobody sleeps outside. How do I look? Divine! Hello! Is my daughter here? Yuma, it's for you. Where are the kids? At school, of course. Send them home later. No, they're staying with me. - No way. I'm their mother. - Really? They're safer with me. You gonna raise them with that whore? That's no role model. Look who's talking. Don't talk back! I'm your mom. I'm not a kid anymore. You won't last a week. You have no idea what kids are like. You don't know what I've been through, the sacrifices I've made. You can all go to hell. I did what I had to do. I know Alfonso's a no good skirt-chaser. But going from that to... Oh, my God. That's terrible. Are you sure? I'm not doing this for the fun of it. I'm not blind. Would you prefer I did nothing? - Easy. That's for the kids. Put it aside. If what you say is true, you did the right thing. It's just hard to believe your mom... you know... Now what are you gonna do? I need money. Can I have an advance? I already advanced you a month's pay. I know. I have to figure something out. It's an emergency. Okay. But this is the last time. You're a good person. - Don't go soft on me. Speaking of softies! How's it going? How you been, sweetie? So, Yumita? What's new? Not much. Scarlett's a big help. But what will I do with the kids next week? I got you a gig. Really? - Where? That new circus in the barrio... I know the owner. He wants to make some changes in the show. He's looking for new acts. - Do I look like a clown? Of course not. He wants a women's boxing number. He says the crowd will love it. He pays well. How much? - I don't know. You have to talk. Polvorita, when do I get top billing? You just had your first fight! I know, coach, but I have to move up. One step at a time. You've got a lotta work to do. You have to hone your style. You're not ready yet. But I'll train hard! Sure. But what's the hurry? I have to earn a living. I've got responsibilities. I don't know. You'll make a fool of yourself. No, I won't. I'll earn a living. Like a professional. In a circus? They'll laugh at you. I know what it's like. You're worth more than that. No, girlfriend. I'm not ashamed to do this. I wanna make it on my own. And not ask anybody for shit. It's like talking to a wall. You always do what you want. That's right. Listen, if you get the other girl, we can start next week. I'll talk to her and get back to you. But what's the deal? What is it? The stink? - Sort of. Peter, when are you gonna bathe these animals? Mr. Salvador, what about the pay? Let me explain it to you. Here in the circus, we're one big family. Everybody does their part. For example, they work, they eat. The same goes for you. If you fill the tent, you'll make good money. Don't worry. We'll make it work. That's what I like to hear. Deal! Bye, Cassandra! See you later. The moment you've all been waiting for. For the first time in Nicaragua, a Libertad Circus exclusive, Women's Boxing under the big top. You'll see the best female boxers in Nicaragua and all of Central America. Allow me to present a rising star in national boxing. I'm talking about Yuma, «The Wildcat». Today she's pitted against a real spitfire. The terrible, the veteran, «The Lioness.» In three rounds these beauties will demonstrate that nobody messes with them. Let the fight begin! May the best woman win! Rommel! Come on, we're leaving! Hurry!
