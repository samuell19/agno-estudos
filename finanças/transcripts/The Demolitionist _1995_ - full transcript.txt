( music playing ) ( dogs barking ) ( woman screams on TV ) ( both laugh ) THAT MARLIN, MAN, HE IS ONE BAD FISH. ( laughter ) Priest: BOYS, THE HOUR IS DRAWING NEAR. DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD BE MAKING A LITTLE BIT BETTER USE OF THIS TIME? WELL, FILL ME IN ON THE PROTOCOL, PADRE. HOW EXACTLY DO WE DO THAT? WELL, YOU MIGHT CONTEMPLATE THE NATURE OF YOUR CRIMES. REPENT OF YOUR SINS. - YOU HEAR THAT, L.H.? - YEAH. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE BAD, BAD THINGS WE'VE DONE. - OH. -( screaming on TV continues ) ( both laugh ) YOU KNOW WHAT, FATHER? YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA. HEY, HEY, HEY, LOOK! IT'S US! Christy Carruthers: The executioner's song is playing tonight for the bloodthirsty Burne Brothers. The eyes of the nation are on Metro City as these sadistic siblings await side-by-side seats in the electric chair. "Mad Dog" and "Little Henry" Burne were the first criminals to be convicted under the city's controversial anti-firearms amendment for their part in the Metro City Mall robbery two years ago, which ended in the massacre of six bystanders and three Metro police officers. Ironically, the brothers' fates now rest in the hands of the very person who led the crusade to abolish all weapons within the Metro City limits, Mayor Eleanor Grimbaum. Early today, by order of the governor, Grimbaum was given penal jurisdiction in the matter. Only a phone call from her can save the condemned men now. ( TV clicks off ) ( dials ) MR. LEE, IT'S MAYOR GRIMBAUM. IT'S NOT TOO LATE, IS IT? OH, THANK GOD. MM, GOOD. GOOD. UH, ADD A SESAME CHICKEN AND A PORK RICE TO THAT, WOULD YOU? - MM. FRIED. - ( chuckles ) - ( flashbulbs clicking ) - ( hushed whispering ) ( metallic squeaks ) ( yells ) ( chatter ) ( gate creaks ) ONE QUESTION-- HOW SHALL I SERVE YOU? COME AGAIN, WARDEN? AFTER YOU'RE COOKED. SHALL I SERVE YOU WITH POTATOES OR STUFFING? WELL, DON'T GO PREHEATIN' YOUR OVEN JUST YET. THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF DINNER PLANS. ( yells ) ( screaming ) ( yells, laughs ) DAVID COPPERFIELD DOESN'T HAVE SHIT ON ME. SOME LAST-MINUTE SUBSTITUTIONS IN THE CAST TONIGHT, FOLKS. ROLL IT, HENRY. ( screaming ) SORRY, NO REFUNDS. ( screams ) - MOVE IT! - I WANNA SEE THOSE FUCKERS DANCE AROUND AGAIN. COME ON, DROP IT, WE'RE OUT OF HERE. - ONE MORE TIME. - NO! - ( sirens blaring ) - ( music playing ) ( motorcycles revving ) ( chatting, laughing ) - ( gang cheers greetings ) - MAD DOG! HEY! MAD DOG! WHOO! IT'S SHOWTIME. WHAT A SORRY BUNCH OF DRUG ADDICTS, - DEGENERATES, AND WHORES. - Man: YEAH. - DAMN, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK! - ( gang cheers ) I WANT TO THANK SKIN HERE FOR-- WELL, FOR RUNNING THINGS FOR ME WHILE I'VE BEEN ON VACATION. - HE'S DONE A DAMN GOOD JOB. - ( applause ) NOW, SKIN ASSURES ME THAT-- WELL, NOW THAT I'M BACK, THE TRANSITION OF POWER, WELL, WILL BE A SMOOTH ONE. - ( crowd cheers) - ( gags ) LATER, SKINS. ( laughs ) ( gang cheers, laughs ) NOW, IF YOU WANT TO ROB ME AND STEAL FROM ME, GOD BLESS YOU. JUST, UH, WELL, - JUST DON'T GET CAUGHT. - ( crowd laughs ) ALL RIGHT. THIS IS NO TIME FOR CELEBRATION. MY BROTHER IS DEAD. AND HIS BLOOD IS ON THE HANDS OF THAT FUCKING WOMAN WHO PUT US IN THAT HOLE AND TRIED TO SHUT US DOWN. WELL, TONIGHT... WE'RE GOING TO RIP THE TITS OFF THAT FUCKING BITCH - AT CITY HALL! - ( gang cheers ) ( music playing ) Man: GET RID OF HER. -( dispatch chatter ) - You're new. You know what? I'M GONNA ENJOY BREAKING YOU IN. ( gang laughs ) ( dispatch chatter ) THAT SON OF A BITCH LANDED RIGHT IN OUR LAPS! You know, you better warn the mayor because they're coming after her tonight. ( pipe clanging ) I'M TELLING YOU if I can isolate Mad Dog, I'm taking him out. NO, DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. ( sighs ) SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU LIKE THE LEATHER FOR THE WEDDING or you into the traditional white? ALYSSA, NOW DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY. - JUST WAIT, WAIT FOR BACKUP. - I got to go. ALYSSA, WAIT FOR BACK-- SHE NEVER WAITS. IT'S ABOUT FREAKIN' TIME. WHAT WAS YOU DOIN'? CHECKIN' FOR WORMS? DON'T MAKE ME HURT YOU, BOXER. OH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT. WHEN BALLERINAS GROW BALLS, RIGHT? WHEN BALLERINAS GROW BALLS. ( sirens blaring ) ( music playing ) ALL RIGHT, LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE. PRESS IS TRYING TO CRUCIFY ME. HOW DID THEY GET SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE? HOW DID THEY GET FIREARMS PAST THE SCANNERS? ANSWER ME THAT, HIGGINS. UH, WE DON'T KNOW YET, YOUR HONOR. WELL, I'VE GOT SCANNERS EVERYWHERE. I'VE EVEN GOT ONE AT MY GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES. HOW DID THEY GET PAST THE ONES IN METRO PEN? WE BELIEVE IT WAS A PLASTIC WEAPON, MA'AM. OR A RESIN COMPOUND. FROM THE REMAINING TRACES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO-- Grimbaum: YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO FIND MAD DOG? WELL, WE'VE GOT A G6 MO-TECH UNIT ON THE SCENE AT THE PRISON. UH, THEY'RE SEEING WHAT THEY CAN DIG UP AND, UH, WE'VE ALERTED THE U.C.s IN THE FIELD. WHAT THE HELL ARE "U.C.s"? UNDERCOVER OPERATIVES. WOULD YOU CUT THE MATT HELM SHIT, CHIEF? YOU-- HONEY, I AM DOING A PRESS CONFERENCE, NOT "OTHELLO." WOULD YOU BLEND THIS?! NOW LOOK, BOYS, MARK MY WORDS, IF I GO DOWN ON THIS, I SHALL DO SO WITH MY NAILS FIRMLY IMPLANTED INTO YOUR BALLS. HAVE YOU GOT THAT?! THIS IS AN ELECTION YEAR. MY APPROVAL RATING'S AT 33%. OW! AND THAT WAS BEFORE MAD DOG ESCAPED. Man: 31%. I HAVE NO TIME FOR KISS-ASSES, PROFESSOR. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? PERHAPS WE SHOULD DISCUSS HOW I CAN HELP YOU. Higgins: AND WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? LAZARUS. OH, THE PROM IS OVER, JACK. STOP ASKING ME TO DANCE. EVEN IF I TOTALLY APPROVE THE LAZARUS PROJECT, WHICH I DON'T, THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO SUPPORT IT. - SHE'S RIGHT. - I SUGGEST YOU FIND IT. OR ELSE? OR ELSE THE VOTERS WILL LOOK AT YOU AS THE WOMAN WHO GAVE METRO CITY BACK TO THE CRIMINALS. THAT'S HARDLY FAIR. AT THE TIME, WE ALL REACTED FAVORABLY TO THE CIVIL UNREST AMENDMENT. IF OTHER MEASURES WERE TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ABOLISHMENT OF GUNS. LAZARUS WAS ONE OF THOSE MEASURES. YOU HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS, IT'S A MATTER OF SELF-PRESERVATION. ( phone ringing ) YES? YES. THE MAYOR? IS THIS A RELIABLE SOURCE? STRANGE TIME TO BE WASHING WINDOWS. - ( yells ) - ( music playing ) ( screams ) ( screams ) ( groans ) PROFESSOR CROWLEY, PLEASE PUT YOUR GUN ON THE TABLE AND PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK. YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL UNREST AMENDMENT. BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS, HIGGINS! I'M GREEN-LIGHTING LAZARUS AS OF NOW. OTHER THAN A CHECK, WHAT DO YOU NEED? A CANDIDATE. ( music playing ) ( crowd cheering ) ( phone ringing ) HELLO? IT'S OUR FRIEND. YEAH? YEAH, I'M LISTENING. BAD NEWS FROM CITY HALL? SHE'S ALIVE. WHAT HAPPENED? - THERE'S A RAT ON BOARD. - Man: A RAT? - FLUSH IT OUT. - ( gang chatters ) Man: IT'S NOT ME. ARE YOU A RAT? WHAT?

( groans ) Man: SOMEBODY WOKE UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED. ( laughter ) ENOUGH! TAKE A SEAT, PIG! I SMELL BACON. - Mad Dog: PRETTY PLEASE? - ( yells ) SEE THIS GUN? WELL, THIS IS MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION. LITTLE HENRY KNOCKED OFF HIS FIRST LIQUOR STORE WITH THIS BABY. AND, WELL, I ONLY TAKE IT OUT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS. YOU PLAY GAMES? WHY DON'T YOU CUT THE BULLSHIT?! WE HAVE YOU COLD, THIS PLACE IS GOING TO BE CRAWLING-- SAVE IT! SAVE IT! NOW... I'VE BEEN READING POKER FACES SINCE I WAS... EIGHT YEARS OLD.

WELL, I GUESS GOD'S ON MY SIDE, ANGEL. NOW, UH, I'M GONNA THROW IN A WILDCARD HERE, ALL RIGHT? NOW, IF YOU TWO PLAY FAIR, WELL, THE WINNER CAN TAKE MY PERSONAL MESSAGE TO THE MAYOR. WAKE UP! COME ON! NO ONE LIKES A GUY WHO FALLS ASLEEP AT PARTIES. JEEZ. NOW, UH, WHERE WAS I? NOBODY LIKES A GUY WHO FALLS ASLEEP AT PARTIES. THANKS. NOW, IF YOU MOVE THAT PIECE AN INCH, YOU'RE BOTH FUCKIN' DEAD. - LET THE GAMES BEGIN! - ( crowd cheers ) COME ON, MAN. DO IT! ( clicks ) - ( clicks twice, fires ) - OH!

( EKG beeping ) OFFICER LLOYD, CAN YOU HEAR ME? LISTEN TO ME. YOU ARE GOING TO DIE, BUT I CAN OFFER YOU A SECOND CHANCE. DO YOU WANT THAT CHANCE? DO YOU WANT IT?! ( flatlines ) - I UNDERSTAND. - MOVE! WE'RE GOING TO LOSE HER! MOVE! - Nurse: CHARGE 200. - CLEAR. AND AGAIN. - CALL IT. - NO, THERE'S STILL A CHANCE. CALL IT! Nurse: BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE RESULTS. WHO ARE THESE GUYS? THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ROOM. - Man: GET OUT OF THE WAY, PLEASE. - Man #2: EVERYONE OUT. Nurse: GET THESE GUYS OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW. - Man #2: GOOD? LET'S GET HER OUT. - Man: GOT IT. Man #2: MOVE. LET'S GO. ROLL ON, ROLL ON. LET'S GO. Crowley: IT'S BEEN 72 HOURS SINCE THE FUNERAL OF ALYSSA LLOYD. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROCESS HAS MET WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS. ALL LIFE SIGNS APPEAR FUNCTIONAL. THE REST IS UP TO HER. GOOD MORNING, MISS LLOYD. HOW DO YOU FEEL? WHERE AM I? WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? - AM I DEAD? - YOU WERE. MY CONDOLENCES. BREAKFAST? WHERE'S MY PARTNER? SERGEANT DUPRE IS AT CITY GENERAL. HE'S VEGETATIVE. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. WHO ARE YOU? I'M PROFESSOR JACK CROWLEY. I'M IN CHARGE OF THE LAZARUS PROJECT. YEAH? WHAT THE HELL'S THAT? AT THE MOMENT, YOU. LOOK, COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC? ( gasps ) LOOK AT YOUR HAND. IN THIS NEW AGE OF BIO-MOLECULAR MECHANICS, THIS IS GOD. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME? REPLACED YOUR BLOOD WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL PLASMIC SERUM OF ENGINEERED PROTEINS. THINK OF THEM AS MICROSCOPIC MACHINES THAT WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOUR BRAIN TO STIMULATE LIFE FUNCTIONS IN DEAD TISSUE. DEAD TISSUE? SO, WHAT, YOU'RE DR. FRANKENSTEIN? WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MAKE ME? I'M A SCIENTIST, NOT A PHILOSOPHER. I'VE BEEN COMMISSIONED TO CREATE A SOLIDER OF JUSTICE. SOMEONE TO WAGE WAR ON THE CRIMINALS OF THE CITY WITH ABSURDLY EXTREME PREJUDICE. NO. SORRY TO INFORM YOU, PROFESSOR, BUT I RETIRED, OKAY? I THINK THAT THAT OPTION COMES RIGHT ALONG WITH DEATH. NOT ACCORDING TO RIDER 48c OF YOUR CONTRACT. WHAT? THAT'S, LIKE, AN ORGAN DONATION ADDENDUM. YES, EXACTLY. IN THE EVENT OF AN ON-THE-JOB FATALITY, YOUR BODY BELONGS TO THE CITY. IS THAT YOUR SIGNATURE? ( music playing ) WHY? HERE TO CONFESS FOR A LIFETIME OF SINNING? I DON'T THINK I'M QUITE READY TO MEET THE MAKER YET. DESPITE YOUR SURPRISE ATTACK ON CITY HALL. I MEAN, YOU ALMOST DID ME IN. - YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T GET THE NEWSLETTER? - ( scoffs ) VERY FUNNY, ASSHOLE. PLEASE, HIGGS. THE LANGUAGE. THIS IS THE HOUSE OF GOD. LOOK, PAL. IF IT WASN'T FOR ME YOUR ASS WOULD BE FRIED WONTON. - YOU OWE ME. - LITTLE ADAM DOESN'T OWE YOU. HE'S DEAD. GOD REST HIS SOUL. I'M SORRY. BUT THAT WASN'T MY FAULT. I WANT MORE. I WANT A FULL PARTNERSHIP. A FULL PARTNERSHIP? WELL, WELL, WELL. LET ME BRING IN MY BUSINESS NEGOTIATOR. ( dog growls ) NEGOTIATE. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU-- WHAT IS THIS, HUH? HUH? WELL, HIGGS. HE'S WAITIN' TO HEAR YOUR PITCH. OKAY. I-- I GOT-- ACCESS TO GUNS. CONFISCATED GUNS. I GOT THOUSANDS OF GUNS. YOU KNOW WHAT, HIGGS? I'D PICK UP THE PACE. I THINK MY NEGOTIATOR'S GETTING A LITTLE HUNGRY. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN. LISTEN. WE'LL ARM ALL THE CRIMINALS, ALL RIGHT? AND THERE WILL BE TOTAL CHAOS. GRIMBAUM WILL BE DEAD IN THE NEXT ELECTION, I PROMISE. OH, I THINK SHE'LL BE DEAD WAY BEFORE THAT. WE GET A NEW MAYOR. THAT'S IT. WE GET A NEW MAYOR. HE REPEALS THE C.U.A. I TALK TO SOME PEOPLE, WE GOT BACKING. A NEW MAYOR! HUH? YOUR NEW BUSINESS PARTNER. ME?! HUH? DOWN. DOWN, SWEETHEART. DOWN! DON'T WANT TO BITE OUR NEW PARTNER. WHO NEEDS ANOTHER MAYOR WITHOUT BALLS, HUH? PULL IT BACK. ( music playing ) Crowley: PROGRESS REPORT. SUBJECT'S STRENGTH INCREASES EVERY SESSION-- UP 52% SINCE MONDAY. SPEED AND EYE-HAND COORDINATION HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED. - THE SUBJECT GOES THROUGH SPARRING PARTNERS... - ( groans ) ...LIKE HUMAN DOMINOES. SHE'S BECOME A FIERCE PREDATOR. ITHE QUESTION IS, WILL SHE BE ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE MAYOR'S WAR ON CRIME? I UNDERSTAND, MAYOR. YES, I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE. IT WOULDN'T BE WISE TO RUSH THE PROCESS. THERE-- YES. SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, YES, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ( music playing ) TENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WILL COMPROMISE THE SOLUTION. A BOOSTER TO THE JUGULAR WILL TEMPORARILY REVERSE THE PROCESS. FOR HOW LONG? RESULTS VARY DEPENDING ON THE STRESS LEVEL OF THE SUBJECT. YOU KNOW, YOUR SUBJECT HAS A NAME. CLEAR YOUR MIND. ELIMINATE THE PAST. STRONG EMOTIONS WILL COMPROMISE THE SOLUTION. AND I'LL ACCEPT NO COMPROMISES. ( gasps ) Crowley: CONCUSSION GRENADES, 30-METER RANGE. TELESCOPING STAFF WITH TITANIUM CARBIDE ROTATING BLADES. IT WILL CUT THROUGH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. A HIGHLY COMPACT ASSAULT WEAPON. THE SIGNATURE GRIP IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC HEAT PATTERN FROM YOUR HAND. ANYBODY ELSE WHO TRIES TO USE IT IS IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE. INTEGRAL LASER MOUNT, 400 YARDS. YEAH, WELL, DON'T EXPECT PERFECTION ON THE FIRST TIME OUT. I WAS TRAINED IN CLOSE-RANGE TASERS. I EXPECT NOTHING FROM THE OLD YOU. I DEMAND PERFECTION FROM WHAT YOU'VE BECOME. ( music playing ) LET'S MOVE THE TARGET BACK. THE PROCESS HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH DIALYSIS. A SERIES OF NEEDLES PENETRATE MAJOR ARTERIES. BLOOD IS FLUSHED FROM HER BODY AND REPLACED DAILY WITH A SYNTHETIC SOLUTION OF NANO MACHINES. THIS SOLUTION RAPIDLY REGENERATES DAMAGED CELLS OR, WHEN SUFFUSED WITH UNFILTERED BLOOD, RAPIDLY DESTROYS THEM. I'M IMPRESSED, JACK. IT'S GOT MEDIA SAVVY. I THINK SHE'S GOT THIS KIND OF JOAN OF ARC THING. SHE'S REALLY-- - WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? - ( moaning ) UH, I THINK IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF-- NEUROCOGNITIVE RESIDUE. I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. ( gasping, whimpering ) ( music playing ) ( laughing ) ( piano playing ) NO, I'M NOT GETTING BACK IN THAT THING. YOU HAVE TO. WHAT, BECAUSE OF MY CONTRACT? SUE ME. AND HAVE A GOOD TIME TRYING TO SQUEEZE MONEY OUT OF A CORPSE. MISS LLOYD, THE NANO CELLS HAVE A FINITE LIFE SPAN. WITHOUT A DAILY TRANSFUSION IN THE CHAIR, MASSIVE ORGANIC DEGENERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. YOU'LL ROT. YEAH, WELL, IT'S MY CHOICE TO MAKE. YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE? YES. YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE. A CHOICE SERGEANT DUPRE UNFORTUNATELY CAN NO LONGER MAKE FOR HIMSELF, THANKS TO MAD DOG AND HIS COMPANIONS. ( computer beeping ) CAN I EXPECT YOUR COOPERATION? ( machine beeping ) ( piano playing ) -Subject Alyssa Lloyd. - ( computer beeping ) U.C. operative, badge number 751. Current status: deceased. Deceased. Deceased. Deceased. ( keypad beeping ) YOU WALKED OUT ON AN EXPLOSIVES TRAINING THIS AFTERNOON. I'D LIKE AN EXPLANATION. I WONDER IF ANYBODY PUT WHITE ROSES ON MY GRAVE. I LOVE WHITE ROSES. DID YOU KNOW THAT? IS THAT IN YOUR FILE? DAN LOVED MY LIPS. I WONDER IF HE WOULD NOW. I MEAN, WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE TO KISS SOMETHING THAT'S DEAD? I WOULDN'T KNOW. YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE UP YOUR TRAINING TOMORROW. ( crying ) ( clanging ) ( gasping ) - ( laughter ) - ( gunshot ) ( groans ) ( keypad beeping ) ( machine beeping ) IT'S OKAY, BABY. THIS IS ALL OVER FOR BOTH OF US. ( flatlining ) - Lloyd's voice: WE HAVE YOU COLD! - Mad Dog's voice: SAVE IT! Dupre's voice: ALYSSA, WAIT FOR BACKUP! Mad Dog's voice: I'M GONNA ENJOY BREAKING YOU IN. Lloyd's voice: GO FUCK YOURSELF! Crowley's voice: I CAN OFFER YOU A SECOND CHANCE. DO YOU WANT THAT CHANCE? DO YOU WANT IT?! Mad Dog's voice: WHAT A SORRY BUNCH OF DRUG ADDICTS, DEGENERATES, AND WHORES. Crowley's voice: SERGEANT DUPRE IS AT CITY GENERAL. HE'S VEGETATIVE. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO. - Mad Dog's voice: IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK! - ( gang cheers ) Crowley's voice: WITHOUT A DAILY TRANSFUSION IN THE CHAIR, MASSIVE ORGANIC DEGENERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. YOU WILL ROT. Mad Dog's voice: IF GOD IS LISTENING TO YOU, WELL, THEN, CLICK. IF HE'S LISTENING TO YOUR FRIEND OVER HERE... - BAM! - ( Lloyd screams ) Lloyd's voice: IF I CAN ISOLATE MAD DOG, I'M TAKING HIM OUT. TAKING HIM OUT. WHO WAS WATCHING THE MONITOR WHEN SHE WALKED OUT OF HERE?! AS A PRECAUTION FOR THIS, WE HAD HEAT SENSORS, WE HAD ALARMS. - YOU WERE CAUGHT COMPLETELY UNPREPARED. -( door opens ) HELP ME. - NO. - ( gasping ) I'M DYING! HELP ME! WHY? YOU HAVE NO ONE TO LIVE FOR. WHAT'S THE USE? MAD DOG. I WANT MAD DOG! IN YOUR CURRENT STATE, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT, MISS LLOYD. PUT ME IN THAT CHAIR NOW! YOU NEED ME. - GO. - ( music playing ) Crowley: HOOK HER UP! YOUR SUIT AND BODY ARMOR HAVE BEEN REINFORCED WITH BULLETPROOF AND FIREPROOF KEVLAR. THE BUILT-IN TRANSMITTER INSIDE YOUR MASK ALLOWS FOR TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMIZED CYCLE, WHICH HAS AN 11.2-SECOND RESPONSE PER QUARTER MILE. IT TOO IS BULLETPROOF, NATURALLY, WITH AN ONLINE COMPUTER BUILT INTO THE DASH. IT'S BEEN CALIBRATED TO FIT YOUR BODY MASS WITHIN A THREE-POUND VARIABLE. SO WATCH YOUR WEIGHT. THERE'S BEEN A SERIES OF HIJACKINGS AT METRO HARBOR. WORD IS MAD DOG'S STOCKPILING MERCHANDISE FOR CASH. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE IS AT YOUR DISCRETION. Boxer: I SAID SHUT UP! HURRY UP! SHUT UP! HURRY UP! WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? A UNION JOB? DON'T SAY A WORD. DON'T EVEN CRY OUT IN PAIN. - ( groans ) - ( laughing ) ( motorcycle revving ) I BET YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE IN A LONG TIME, HUH? I BET YOU WISH YOU HAD ONE OF THESE INSTEAD OF THAT SORRY-ASS CATTLE PROD. ( laughing ) THAT'S COMING OUT OF YOUR ASSES! NOW PICK IT UP, YOU UGLY FUCKS! OR I'LL PUT SOME REAL LEAD IN YOUR ASSES! ( laughs ) ( music playing ) WHAT? ( screams ) HOLY SHIT! ( groans ) ( groans ) ( blades whirring ) WHAT THE FUCK? FUCK! YES! THIS MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY! ( beeping ) Computer voice: Excess body mass. Access denied. - SHUT DOWN. - Access denied. Boxer: WHAT THE FUCK? WHO'S DENIED? ( brakes screech ) WHOA! SHIT! DAMN! SHIT! WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOXER? NEVER SEEN A BALLERINA WITH BALLS BEFORE? OH, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. IT CAN'T BE YOU 'CAUSE YOU WAS DEAD. WHO WAS DEAD? OH, LORDSY, LORDSY NOW, LADY. YOU WOULDN'T KILL A BOXER, WOULD YA? IN A HEARTBEAT. ( music playing ) CONGRATULATIONS. YOUR APPROVAL RATINGS HAVE RISEN CONSIDERABLY. I SIMPLY RESPONDED TO THE VOTERS' NEEDS. DEMOLITIONIST IS THE PEOPLE'S WEAPON. WELL PUT, YOUR HONOR. ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR PRESS DENIAL? OH, CHRIST. BRING 'EM IN. Reporter: HERE WE GO. LET'S SET UP ON THIS SIDE. Reporter #2: MADAM MAYOR, CAN I HAVE THE FIRST QUESTION? Reporter: A CLEARER SHOT HERE. MADAM MAYOR, SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF THIS MYSTERIOUS PHANTOM IN METRO CITY, CRIME HAS BEEN ON A STEADY DECLINE. COINCIDENTALLY, YOUR APPROVAL RATING HAS SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF. - CARE TO COMMENT? - OH, I'VE NEVER GIVEN TOO MUCH CREDENCE TO THE POLLS, MISS CARRUTHERS. ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT MY CURRENT POSITION IS RATHER FLATTERING. ( laughing ) CRIME IS DOWN. GUN RUNNING IS AT A TWO-YEAR LOW, AS I PREDICTED AND PROMISED. SO THERE. NOW YOU GOT SOME GOOD NEWS TO REPORT, MISS CARRUTHERS. FOR A CHANGE. I'LL SANDWICH IT IN BETWEEN MY COVERAGE ON THE MAYORAL RACE AND THE QUESTION THAT'S ON ALL OUR MINDS, YOUR HONOR. WHICH IS? WHO IS SHE? SHE'S NOT REGULAR POLICE. WHO IS THE DEMOLITIONIST? THAT'S AN INTRIGUING QUESTION. AND THE ANSWER, AS FAR AS THE GOOD PEOPLE OF METRO CITY ARE CONCERNED, IS THAT IT'S COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. GOT TO EXCUSE ME, I'VE GOT A CITY TO RUN. Reporter: MADAM MAYOR, ONE MORE QUESTION. SO THE QUESTION REMAINS. WHO IS THE WOMAN BEHIND THE MASK OF METRO CITY'S CRIME-FIGHTING PHANTOM? WHO IS THE DEMOLITIONIST? VIEWERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO DIAL IN THEIR SUGGESTIONS AT 1-900-555-DEMO. AM I, LIKE, REALLY SHINY? ( sighs, urinating ) ( door closes ) YOU CALL THAT A DICK? IT LOOKS LIKE ONE, ONLY SMALLER. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? ARE YOU CRAZY? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHO OR WHAT IS THAT PSYCHO BITCH IN THE OUTFIT? SHE'S BEEN KNOCKING OFF MY BOYS LEFT AND RIGHT. WHAT? THE DEMOLITIONIST? IT'S A GODDAMN PUBLICITY STUNT. GRIMBAUM'S TICKET TO RE-ELECTION. WELL, SHE'S ONE GODDAMN DETERMINED PUBLICITY STUNT. PULL THE PLUG ON HER, YOU HEAR ME? NOW! NOW! SORRY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE MUSCLE. NOW IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT, I'LL TAKE MY BUSINESS TO SOMEBODY WHO CAN. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE AN EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE, YOU KNOW. YEAH, WE DO. HERE IT IS. YOU SCREW ME, HIGGS, YOU UNDERSTAND? AND THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU PISS STANDING UP, GOT IT? YEAH. - YEAH? - YEAH. NOW YOU GET ME THOSE FUCKING GUNS... AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. OKAY?

( crying, screaming ) ( groans ) ( sirens blaring ) Lloyd's voice: SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU LIKE THE LEATHER FOR THE WEDDING, OR YOU INTO THE TRADITIONAL WHITE? ( alarm sounding ) ( music playing ) ( door opens ) WHAT'S ALL THIS? I THOUGHT WE'D CELEBRATE. I GUESS YOUR CREATION IS THE REAL TALK OF THE TOWN, HUH? WHAT IS IT? NON-ALCOHOLIC? YOU KNOW ALCOHOL DOESN'T MIX WELL WITH BLOOD. WHAT? THESE ROSES AREN'T EVEN REAL? SO IT NEVER DIES. OPEN IT. IT'S FOR YOU. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. RARE. SYMBOL OF OSIRIS. OSIRIS? EGYPTIAN GOD OF THE DEAD. CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS OR YOU'LL COMPROMISE THE SOLUTION. I CAN'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS! I DON'T WANT TO CONTROL THEM! GOD, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE DAY THAT I'M ABLE TO CONTROL HOW I FEEL, THEN I'M REALLY DEAD?! KIND OF LIKE HOW YOU ARE NOW! EGYPTIANS WORSHIP THE DEAD. P.A.: Ho, ho, ho. A Christmas reminder to all of our customers. It's never too early to start thinking about the holidays. With that in mind, Metro City Bank is offering a one-time Christmas bonus. Customers opening a holiday account on Friday will receive a toaster. - MOM. - STOP IT. ...bagels and all your holiday toasting needs. Just our way of saying thank you for using Metro City Bank. ( music playing ) - ( gunshots ) - ( crowd screaming ) WHO DO I SPEAK TO ABOUT MAKING A LARGE CASH WITHDRAWAL? I HOPE IT'S NOT THIS MAN. ( tires screeching ) Computer voice: 211 in progress-- Metro City Bank. ( beeping ) Higgins: STAY DOWN. DO NOT GO IN UNTIL I GIVE THE ORDER. - DO YOU COPY? - ( dispatch chatter ) WE WON'T NEED YOUR HELP ON THIS ONE. WE'VE GOT THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL. UNDER CONTROL? A BANK FULL OF HOSTAGES? THERE ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THERE. AND I WON'T ALLOW A BLOOD-BATH, NOT ON MY WATCH. WE'RE NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE WITH ANIMALS. I'M ORDERING YOU TO STAND DOWN. YEAH, WELL, I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU. FINE. DO IT YOUR WAY. - HOW MANY ARE IN THERE? - FIVE, MAYBE SIX... INCLUDING MAD DOG. YEAH. COME ON! MOVE IT! PUT THE MONEY IN THE BAG! COME ON! PUT SOME COINAGE IN THERE, TOO, ALL RIGHT? I GOT TO DO SOME LAUNDRY. - OH, SHIT! - ( motorcycle engine roars ) WE'LL BE LEAVING NOW. I DON'T THINK SO. YOU'RE KILLING HER. HERE. HERE, TURN AROUND, HONEY. IT'S OKAY. THE BIG BAD BITCH IN BLACK DOESN'T WANT TO HURT US, DOES SHE? ( beeping ) ( beeping ) ( screams ) ( explosion ) Higgins: YOU'RE SURE SHE'S OKAY? BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE A DOCTOR LOOK AT HER IF YOU'D LIKE. ALL RIGHT? ( sirens blaring ) -DAWSON, GET A MEDIC ON THIS. -( radio chatter ) - ( door opens, closes ) - ( whistling ) GOOD WORK, PROFESSOR. CREATED QUITE A MONSTER. YOU'RE OVER-REACTING. NO. I LEFT A LITTLE GIRL TO DIE BECAUSE I WANTED MAD DOG. OKAY, I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, I JUST DID WHAT I WAS CREATED TO DO. I MEAN, I DON'T-- I DON'T EVEN THINK OR FEEL LIKE A HUMAN BEING AT ALL ANYMORE. I'M JUST-- I'M JUST, LIKE, SOME WEIRD KILLING MACHINE. AND YOU BLAME ME? MISS LLOYD, YOUR PASSION FOR VENGEANCE HAS SHAPED WHAT YOU'VE BECOME MUCH MORE THAN LAZARUS EVER DID. AND WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU OBVIOUSLY HARBOR EMOTIONS FROM YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE. FROM THAT NIGHT MAD DOG HAD YOUR LOVER KILLED. MY CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR PSYCHE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT OR THAT UNFORTUNATE BUSINESS WITH THE CHILD. THE CHOICES YOU MAKE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE NOW ARE YOURS. AND YOURS ALONE. EXCELLENT CHOICE. ( music playing ) ( door opens, closes ) Higgins: I AM HOLDING. I HAVE BEEN HOLDING. HIGGINS! WELL, HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT? YEAH, GET ME CHRISTY CARRUTHERS, PLEASE. I HAVE SOMETHING SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN. Has The Demolitionist, Metro City's guardian angel lost her wings? Inside source has obtained exclusive, shocking footage that proved the crime buster's heart may be as black as her wardrobe. Luckily, Metro Police were able to extract the grenades from the crying child and detonate them safely. An inside source at the mayor's office re-- HOW UNFORTUNATE. THAT SHOT WILL MAKE THE COVER OF EVERY PAPER IN THE STATE. CONGRATULATIONS, JACK. WHAT DO WE GET FOR AN ENCORE? I'M SURE IT WAS A BIT OF A POLITICAL SETBACK. YOU CALL LEAVING AN INNOCENT CHILD TO DIE A SETBACK? REGISTERED VOTERS HATE THAT CRAP! IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT. I'M CUTTIN' MY LOSSES RIGHT HERE. SHE'S OFF THE STREETS. I'VE GIVEN ORDERS TO SEE TO IT. IT'S A MATTER OF, HOW DID YOU SAY IT? SELF-PRESERVATION. - YOU CAN'T DO THAT. - NAW, STOP BLEEDING, JACK. LAZARUS IS FINISHED. IL FAIT ACCOMPLI. ALYSSA LLOYD SAVED YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CAREER, MAYOR. YOU PULL THE PLUG ON LAZARUS, IT'S JUST LIKE MURDERING HER. NO, IT ISN'T, JACK. SHE'S ALREADY DEAD. ( music playing ) Officers need assistance. Parking structure, corner of Roosevelt and Fifth. ( tires screeching ) GREAT RESPONSE TIME. SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT EATING DONUTS SOMEWHERE? SHOULDN'T YOU BE DEAD? ( groaning ) THEY PULLED THE PLUG. THERE'S NOTHING I COULD DO. HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE LEFT? ENOUGH TIME TO GET AWAY. THEY'LL BE COMING FOR YOU. AS IF THEY'D STAND A CHANCE. GO. QUICKLY. JACK, THERE'S STILL SOMETHING I GOT TO DO.
