You wanted Venice Beach, I give you Venice Beach. Hey. Hey, how about a thank you and some fucking gas money? I just saved your life. All right, you'll be back. Yeah, buddy. A vision dims and I'm cutting out adrenal glands with a Venice Beach gang. Misirlou is adrenochrome. Convicted snake, Charlie Manson. I remember the war machines and ruined dreams. We used to pump syringes in our asses full of that stuff, turned us into killers. I'm the chief of that shit. Where is my money, Bonnie? I don't know. I never saw any money. She's lying. I will cut your tit completely off. You understand me? Where is my money. I don't know where it is. No, no, no, no, no. You like your fingers, Bonnie? I will cut your fucking finger off. Where is the car parked? It's with Jim Morrison on the street. That a girl, good girl. Give me my fucking keys. I don't, I don't have the keys. I'm' sorry. I don't have... Go get the spare keys, go get the car, okay? Hurry back, 'cause the tsunami's coming. Take her, daddy. Take her. Go, Larry. Come on, go Larry. Come on, cowboy. Oh, yeah. Get it, baby. Ooh, take it to Disneyland. Wanna buy some guns. Hey. I think he wants to buy some guns. Finally, you're speaking my language. What can I do for you? You got an M-27 IAR Mark 153? That's a fucking rocket launcher. What the fuck are you planning on doing with a rocket launcher? Blowing some people up. I don't have any fucking rocket launchers. This is all I got here. What about the AK47? So easy to use, you point it, you shoot... Give me the M16. Now, that's my favorite gun. That's like my favorite gun. I wasn't thinking really on selling it ever. My mother, my mother gave me that gun. It has sentimental value. Okay. Okay, grenades, grenade launcher. I don't have grenades or a grenade launcher. What the fuck do you think I am here? I don't have bazookas. I don't have gatling guns. I don't have torpedoes. I don't have the catapult thing where you hit people's castles. I don't have any of that. I got this. This is all I got. You got any magazines for that? Yeah, I got some magazines. How many you want? As many as you got. Here. Get the fuck outta here. Jesus, man. I know who you are. Oh, fuck. I know what you're on and I know where you get it from. Where's Charlie? That's fucking rude, man. See, I would've just told ya. Now, I want you to know. See, I don't need a machine gun to kill you, motherfucker. I'll cast a spell on you. You're fucking with a heretic. You wanna know where he is? Hmm? Hides in a cave where the eagles crashed, where the dirt forks the road, like the fucking broken wings on a bird of prey. Birds of prey. What the fuck are you talking about? You want me to draw you a map? Yeah. Here. Go up the motherfucking five and then you take the 14 east and you look for the fucking signs, got a V, Vazquez Rocks. Take the fucking map with you. Actually, you can google it. Go get what's coming, Mr. Machine Gun, Mr. All-hopped-up. Why the fuck is everybody crying around here? Let's do some fucking drugs. Yeah. ♪ Ohh Misirlou ♪ The car's not where she said it was. No no no no no. Where is the fucking car, you bitch? I left it there, I left it there, but somebody... She's lying, kill her. Let's cut her adrenal. We gotta get her aroused, makes the gland nice and juicy. No, please, no, please. Yeah. Jesus Christ, we have a fire here, Charlie. Let's get these legs open. Beg some more, beg. Please. Get her juicy, get her juicy. Ooh, yeah. Go see who that is. Go see who the fuck that is. If someone hears and comes, he'll be sorry. Fuck. He's getting close. Shut up. Get up. Please help me. You can't catch me. Your bitch is gonna bleed, motherfucker. You gonna save her, West? Let her go, Charlie. You put that big gun down, Buffalo Bill. You try to hit me, you're gonna kill her. You wanna bet on that. We're all gonna die in the end anyway. And my time is up. You see, god's plan failed. What the fuck are you talking about? Let's make a deal, army boy. You turn in your guns, I'll give you this pretty little girl. You tie your M16 to this. One, two, three. Next time its her throat. All right, take it. Looks like you fell for the ol' American deal. You turn in your fucking gun. Now you're fucked. Please please please, don't shoot me, okay? I'll do whatever you want. I'll tell you where the gold is.

Care to take your medicine? You know what tomorrow is? The fourth of July. It's your favorite holiday. It's summer, it's warm and sunny. You get to see fireworks. Well, you won't. That's okay. You'll see 'em in your mind. Yeah, they go crazy. Say, I love you Charlie. I love you, Charlie. Say it again. I love you, Charlie. Say it a-fucking-gain. I love you, Charlie. Say it one more fucking time. Ha ha, they're in love with me. Whoo. I don't have grenade launchers, I don't have grenades. I don't have torpedoes. I don't have gatling guns. I don't have the catapults that hit people's castles. I don't have any of that. Politician. Poli means people. Tician is the word parasite. So, that's what a politician is, a parasite that sucks the people's blood. If we can spend billions on war, we can give the money to the people. Power to the people. And the government is sucking everyone's blood. I hope we succeeded in bringing you an enjoyable evening of entertainment. Please drive home carefully and come back back again soon. Goodnight.
