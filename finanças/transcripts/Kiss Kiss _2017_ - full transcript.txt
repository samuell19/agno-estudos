You motherfucker. You owe that girl some money. First, lower your voice. Second, I don't owe her shit. She's lucky she's got that much. $500, Sisco. That was the deal. $500. You fucking work for me! Not the other way around. Baby, I'm gonna make this divorce very simple for all of us. We're out. Time to find some new gigs. - Ladies? - Bye. Wait, wait, wait. Kiss? Please. What do you want? I want you to fix the squeaky doors in the dressing room. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Am I? And the light bulbs, they don't even work. We have to do our makeup in the dark, Sisco. Anything else? What's your name again? Tia. Do you wanna make some money tonight? She joins us on stage. - On stage? - On stage. - Fuck no. - Fuck you. - Fuck you! - Fuck you! Everybody in there is there to see us. They're not here to see you. Sisco, you're not treating 'em right. This is some bullshit, and we are out. You don't have anything without us. She fucking works for me, not for you. She does not work for you. You don't even pay her. If I leave, the girls are leaving. This is my fucking place. I don't really work for you. You guys have to remember... Remember Vegas? We don't talk about Vegas anymore. But for now, let's go get food, and the white stuff. You wanna roll with us? So how do you feel? You got cash in your pocket. Yeah. Thank you so much. - You killed it. - Girl, we made our rent tonight. Good. And then some. We had a good day. It was a good-ass night. This guy tipped me with a gift certificate. Okay, let me look at that. - It's a little strange. - It is really strange. A wine tasting? I don't know. That looks sketch. Okay, $500, though. Safaris. Yes. Lions and tigers and llamas. - Llamas? - Yeah, let's do it. - Llamas? - Let's do it. Let's get some food and let's roll out. - You going? - You wanna come? Yes. It's my gift certificate. - Oops. - She bites. Let's do it. We're here. Before noon, trying to get drunk. The fuck outta here. Look at this. That one's so true. So, what does that say, ladies? W-I-N-E spells... - Let's get drunk. - Wine! I'll have a rose wine. What's up, beauty? What's wrong? Uh... I just don't know about what I'm wearing. - I think you look great. - First of all, you're wearing my clothes. Second of all, I think I dress pretty fly. And you look great, so let's go. Once we have wine, no one cares. Wine awaits us, girl. Come on. - What's up, ladies? - Hi. Welcome to Black Horse Wines and Wild Animal Park. What are we drinking today? - What does this get us? - Let me check that out. I've never seen one of these. Let me check with my manager. Hey, ladies, I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news. Um, I don't know where you got this, but I'm sorry. This thing's fake as fuck. Okay, I knew this shit was fake. - We're still gonna drink, though. - Let's drink. Just kidding. Pretty generous for somebody, a $500 gift certificate. You're a jokester. So let's start you out with the house favorite. 2008 Black Horse Cab. You may get ol' cinnamon nutmeg on the nose. What's your name? Gibson. Who are you? - Kiss. - Nice to meet you, Kiss. I'll take some, too. Thank you. Guys, I'm gonna take care of everybody, all right? We like that. There you go. I like this. Let's go through the four S's. We're gonna swirl, smell, sip... Sip. ...and spit. Spit? You know, that's funny. We don't spit. Doesn't make you a bad girl. So, what does the $500 get us? Rico. Hi. It's a wild park. We got antelope, zebra, camel. Can we ride them? Of course, you want to. What about this? Let's slam these two bottles as fast as we can. That sounds like a good plan. It's go time. Welcome to Black Horse Wines... ...and Wild Animal Park. Ladies, here's our number one tour guide. This is my boy, Casey. He enjoys long walks on the beach, sea food and puppies. Not at all. You guys ready for a good tour or what? - Yeah. - Are you coming up? I got you. All right. Let's go. So that's where we prep them. Yeah! All right, ladies, besides exotic animals, we do house a lot of horses. Some are world champions. When they get injured, we nurse them back to health. They're real fighters. We have a little hay if you guys want to feed them. Hey, girl, hay. We keep the ferocious kind in here. Hello, baby. I think he might need some hay. Eric's a good kid. He's 14 years old. Eric, you want some more? You ladies hungry? Come on, I know a place where we can get some great food. - You don't need it. - It doesn't affect us. - Yes, it does. - No, it doesn't. I've already told you this. This is one thing you could do, but... Don't fucking take it. Don't. Don't fucking take it. Fucking serious. Fucking bitch. - Girl! - I know. Where are we? This is just my secret hideaway. Come on, girls. - We know that it's not. - Okay. - Oh, it's so cute. - Nice. Where's the wine? Give me some red. So the pets, right? So, okay, so if somebody's gonna give you a nickname, this is a good question, what would it be? Charles Manson. - What? - Just kidding. Where's my phone? Okay. He's not a bad guy. Don't judge. Okay. All right. So this is, like, the underground hangout? This is like a dream come true. It is like a dream come true. It's pretty dope. Well, excuse me. Where you from? What do you do? Um... I do fun stuff. - What's up with them wings? - Cheers. Too much to drink. Again? Never too much. Why do you do this to yourself? What am I doing? I'm being my fucking self. What do you mean you're being your fucking self? You don't have to fucking drink and do this shit every fucking day. This is what the fuck I do. - If we saw a penguin. - Yes. - Camel, giraffe, zebra. - Zebra. You're gonna do this fucking shit? You're gonna do this fucking shit for what we have? Are you serious? You don't appreciate who the fuck I am now? Do you know what I just said that you were the only reason... Listen to me. - Hey. - Hello there. - Who's back in the party? - I need a drink. You don't have to tell me twice. Thank you. - There you go. - Thank you. It looks like you might need a little more. Hey, hold down the fort. - What's up? Good. - I'm better now. Hi. How are you? I'm good. - You good? - Mm. Parties hard, huh? - Treasure. - What? - Girl. - Come on. What the fuck? You want any? So this is your day job? You have girls come in here and you get them drunk. Is that what you do? I wouldn't say it like that. - You drank the whole vineyard. - The fuck is this? - I drank the whole vineyard? - Yes. You drank some. You definitely drank some. You drank some. You might need to miss some. - Take a break. - You had some. - Chill out. I got it. - You had some. We all had some. I'm not the only one. - I'm not the only one. - I got it. Treasure. What the fuck? I come out here and you're kissing some fucking dick? Come on. Let's chill. Chill? Me, chill? Where's the bottle of fucking wine, Houdini? I'm glad you asked that question, Treasure. My god. Been saving this for a special occasion. I think it's tonight. I've got a special bottle here. Straight from Afghanistan. Aged 25 years. Perfect. Make mine a double, please. Will do. Some for you. So they have vineyards in Afghanistan? Vineyards? Don't forget, ladies. - Swirl... - Some for you. - Some for you? - Swirl and sniff. I would love some. Awesome. That's my girl. Oh, no! Ladies, looks like we got shut out. You know I always come with some extra treats. That's why you're the best in the business. You've been fucking hiding this the whole time? I didn't even feel it there. What is it? You can take this. Better be some strong-ass shit. Give me a hit of that, South Beach. - You like it? - Yup. We need to have a toast. Everybody on your feet. Now I don't know what planet you ladies came from, but it's gotta be damn sexy. Here's to friendship. Oh, wait. Wait, wait. I would like to induct our newest member to our tribe. Our beauty, Promise. And just remember, fortune always follows the sexy. - True that. - To the tribe. - To the tribe. - Let's cheers. So, uh, this is from Afghanistan? Sure is. Tasty. It's really different. Different grapes. Let me try that one. You wanted whiskey, you got whiskey. No, I'm gonna have wine too. I'm a fucking guest here. Give it to me also. You wanna mix your pleasures, Treasure. I can do what I want. I'm a big girl. This time, I want everything. - You're just... - Give me the fucking glass. Fuck you. - Sit down. - Oh, really? Fuck me? She's not even good. You can never just have a conversation with me. What the fuck is going on? What you were doing in there didn't fucking hurt me. Good morning, Kiss. No, no, no. Don't strain your voice. It'll be a minute before it comes back. You're paralyzed. That was some strong wine. One Last Kiss, dangerous. Seriously, Gibson. You're still using that shit? Yes, I am, General. I stockpiled it before you blew it up. Is this torture your idea of amusement? Oh, come on, Senator. This is all just a little foreplay. Ladies, we're all your biggest fans. And those of us who aren't, in 48 hours will be. Now, some of you, eventually all of you, are gonna fight. You're gonna kick some ass for us. Now I'm not gonna sugarcoat this shit. I'm gonna bet some of you won't make it through this alive. Now don't worry. - Rico! - Yes, sir. Give the girls one click each. Just enough so they can eat their dinner. Ladies, command, eat your dinner. Well, holy fucking shit. Impressed now, Senator? Taking an order to eat steak is different from ordering a man to kill someone. I still don't know why on earth we aren't using men to experiment on. If I can take a group of women and turn them into cold-blooded killers, imagine what a seasoned veteran will do. We'll see. Ha-ha! All right, ladies. These are gonna be your VIP rooms for the next few nights. I call this a little slice of heaven. Got spacious areas, good air. Healthy for you. Way to take one for the team. Shit knocked me out. That's what it does. How are our guests? Pumped and ready for action, Chief. Excellent, excellent. That's the beast. A special subject for special circumstances. Ladies, meet your neighbors. This is Fortune and Dream. Girls, don't be rude. Say hello to your new friends. Command. Follow me. Ladies, this way. I've got a special treat for you. And here's my world-class makeup room. Check this out. State-of-the-art gym. That's right. Don't all thank me at once. Come on in, come on in. That's it. Don't get too excited. State-of-the-art makeup station. Beautiful, beautiful. Ladies, why don't we get you ready for the big show? Rico's gonna show you what you girls are gonna be wearing. Command, turn around. Undress. Perfect warriors, just what I wanted. Get 'em dressed. Get 'em working out. Get the makeup on, and let them rock n' roll. - Yes, sir. - All right. Command, ladies. Shadow team, weight room. I need you to work every muscle. Move! Go! Go! Go! Go! Command! Get in a straight line, right behind the others. Go, go! Command. Jog forward. Outside, to the middle of the pit. Let's roll out. Oh, I hope this isn't another colossal waste of my time. Just give him some time. Look. See, look. Master showman. Command. Ghost team on my right. Shadow team on my left. Fall in. I introduce to you, you and your teammate for the weekend. Ghost team! Tia, Fortune, Dream. Shadow team! Treasure, Kiss and Kurious. Six fighters, two teams, two nights, but only one winner. This is a fight to the death. Kill or be killed. Let the dance begin! I think he should just get on with it. There you go. Single file against the gate. Cuff them. Arm up. Arms up. Hello, hello, hello. How are we doing tonight? Just fine, Captain. How are you? - Can you get the show on the road? - So sweet. Heads up. You know better than that. Shame on you. Do I know how to pick 'em or what? Well, that's your gift. He's always had a knack for choosing good stock. Will they actually take the command and fight? In 48 hours, we're gonna make up for the last six years since we pulled out of Afghanistan. We're gonna finish what we started with a small poppy flower in the desert. Senator, will you do the honors? Kiss, Dream. Excellent. $1,000 on Kiss. Grow up, boys. This isn't a sport, this is women. I'll take that bet. Rico? Kiss versus Dream. Copy that, Chief. Command. Follow me. All right, all right, all right. Looks promising. Command. Duel. No combat training, no martial arts? Not these two. Jesus Christ. The serum brings out pure primal instincts. The limits? Endless. Whoa! Literally, I've never seen that before. Did you see that? Boom! Kiss just stompin' on that Dream. Kiss, baby, she is a Dream-killer. I think that's it. Broke her neck. Oh, damn, Captain. All I saw was one woman beating another woman to death. Is this what you dragged me from DC for? Wait for it. Double or nothing? I pick winners, baby. Bring it. Your turn, General. Treasure and Fortune. Ooh, that's an interesting choice. I can't tell you who has the advantage. Come on, not even a little hint? You're a child, General. Rico. Treasure versus Fortune. Let go of me. The fuck is wrong with her? Yo, Gibson, come here. What's the problem? It's Treasure. You sure you don't want me to give her another dose? Everyone has the same two clicks for the first round, Rico. No exceptions. Okay. You good? The bitch just broke my nose! Get out of here, man! Go! Command. Run to the middle of the pit. Fuck! Command. Shit. Hey, she didn't wait for the command. Fuck. Something we don't know about? Treasure does have a little bit of a boxing background. Not a pro or anything, but she knows how to throw a punch or two. I'm not complaining. That's my horse. Kiss. This is too much. You can close your eyes if you want. Holy shit. This is graphic. God. It's another win for my team, Senator. Is she supposed to be doing that? This is warfare. You want soldiers to kill without guilt. This is the perfect fighting machine. The serum works. I'm not looking for senseless, brutal murderers in our military. We have enough of that bullshit going on within our troops without the serum. Hey. Uh, Rico? I think she's dead. Can you clean that shit up, quick? Kids. Copy that, Chief. Promise, can you hear me? Whatever they gave us, it's wearing off. And I think it's gonna get worse. You have a good time, Senator? Actually, no. You have poor taste. You're far from my vote of confidence, and my checkbook. Keep trying. Work with me. Quick, quick, quick. I got her. Shit. Treasure? Treasure. Good God. Brutal. It's just brutal. That girl, you're gonna have to watch out for. You're starting to get it, General. Imagine a special forces SEAL under the same serum, same training. Even an 18-year-old marine, devastating. You need both of our votes for this little enterprise to work. That's $4,000 my way, Gibson. Who's next? General, how about you be the all-time picker? Kurious and Tia. Tia. Is there a problem? I had her saved for something special tomorrow. But maybe it's time to let that idea go. Rico. Kurious versus Tia. You're up next. Let's go. Stop. Command. Sit down. - Stop! - I said sit down! Do it now! Stop! Give it to her. Down, girl! Down! You okay? - You all right? - Shit, man. This shit's getting out of hand, man. Hey, boss, uh, I think we need a wardrobe change. Copy that. Looks like that wraps up tonight's festivities. Things not going to plan? Nope, girls just need a bathroom break. I suggest you get in the game and try to win some money from the general. I got 4,000 in the kitty. Handle your business, Captain. Thank you. Enjoy the pool, jacuzzi and the bar. We'll come back here at 2100 hours. And at that point, you can decide how much you wanna pay me for the serum. Don't waste my time. I didn't come here to watch cockfights. I came here for results. And you'll get those results in 24 hours. Have a little faith. He's your boy. Sort him out. If I recall, this was your idea. Goddamn it, Rico! A wardrobe change? This isn't a fucking beauty pageant! What the fuck happened to your nose? One of the horses got loose. Fucking bitches be crazy. Fuck you. One click an hour. That's the fucking dosage. Chief, everyone except Kurious and Promise has had exactly two clicks from the beginning. Two clicks? 'Cause that looks like you gave her fucking four! Only two, Chief. One an hour. Are you trying to fuck me on this thing, Rico? No, Chief. - And Kiss? - After the fight, she bottomed out. I mean, fast. Can we just keep it together for 48 fucking hours? God! Fuck it. We're done. Clean it up. What about Kiss? Fuck her. If she crashes, I'll just tell them her girlfriend fucking killed her. Treasure? Obviously, it looks like she's a little coked up. Answer: Taker her to the gym and let her pump it out. Yes, sir. Oh... Kiss, hey. We had fun last night, didn't we? Yeah, that's sexy. I love it. Rico, change of plans. Get me Tia. It's time to find out how this serum works personally. All right. Come on. Fuck you. Kiss. Kiss. We're gonna get out of here. I promise. I promise. Are you okay? What? Where are we? Okay. It's gonna be okay. - What's going on, man? - I don't know. I don't know. But when they're on they're not supposed to feel shit. What should we tell the chief? Don't you say a fucking word. Shit. I said just trust me on this, okay? What's going on, boys? - Chief. - Is there a problem, Rico? Not at all, sir. What's up with the ladies? How they doing today? Slept about 18 hours, sir. 18 hours? Looks like we've got ourselves some sleep monsters. Hello, Tia. Or Promise. How are you? You were amazing last night. So sweet. I'm sorry I'm gonna have to kill you and your friends. Best of luck to both of you. Rico, here's the new plan. You're gonna give them two shots. One shot during the gym, another shot right before they go in the ring. But sir, that's two shots in an hour. Are you sure? Yeah, I can do math, Rico. - Sorry, Chief. - You understand me? - Yes, sir. - Shut your fucking mouth. We do this right, boys, we can cash out, we'll be sippin' Mai Tais in Thailand. Yes, sir. Treasure versus Kurious. Fuck! No. - Let's go. - No! - Let's go. - No! No! Command! Kill! Kris, let's be together. We have plans. We have plans. This isn't supposed to be like this. It's not supposed to be like this. No! Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, Kiss. Hurry up, hurry up. I think they're gonna come. Hurry up. - There's not enough time. - Yes, there is. Kiss, Kiss, Kiss. It's not over yet. This is my world! It's just getting started. Wait till you see the second quarter, huh? You think you can escape me? Huh? Huh? Is that what's reminding you? This is my game. My circus. You ingrates! Break them, boys! Get back! Get back! Get 'em in! - Get them in the cage! - Keep going. Get them in the cage. Ah! Guess who's fighting next. Girlfriend versus girlfriend. - No. - Lover versus lover. No, Gibson, no! That's right. Treasure versus Kiss. Yeah, sweet. And now, for the real surprise. Tia, tell 'em who you really are. What? Promise? Go ahead, Tia. Tell 'em. I can't. Yes, you can. - No, I can't. - What did you do? Go ahead. Tell them, Tia. Tia. Tell them, Tia. Tia? - Come on, Tia. - Tell me, Tia. Tia brought you to me. - Tia, tell me. - You fucking bitch! You said you were gonna let me go. We treated you like you were one of us. Why? Why? Why, Promise, why? Kurious is gone because of you! I'm sorry. What's wrong with you? I'm sorry. You think you guys are the first girls we brought and tested this serum on? Do you think anybody's gonna miss a group of fucking strippers? Kiss that, motherfucker! No, we are not strippers, we are fucking ladies! I'm gonna fucking kill you. You hit like a girl. That's probably why you're on your ass, bitch. I'm gonna enjoy watching your girlfriend kick your ass. Casey, Rico, prep 'em. Let's go. And Rico... - Chief. - Two clicks for Treasure. One click for Kiss. Treasure wins, Kiss dies. Just make it happen. - Are you sure? - Goddamn it, Rico. - Just get it done! - Sir. Ah! God. That's my girl. That's my girl. Treasure. Baby. Treasure. Treasure. Baby. I'm right here. I'm right here. Oh, here he is. Jesus, who fucked you up? Go fuck yourself, General. All right. $5,000, two to one odds on Treasure. - Who's gonna take her? - I will. - That Kiss is my stallion. - Yeah. - I'll take your bet. - Even better. Rico, bring 'em in. Command. Go. Command. Go. Go. I can see a strategy. What're you talking about? I'm surprised you can't see it. You're the general. There's no strategy in girls kicking ass. Gibson, if Kiss wins, I'll be truly impressed. What you got? - From the basement. - Oh, wow. That's the old Ali rope-a-dope. She's wearing her down. She's playing possum. That's what I want. Soldiers with intelligence. Fucked you up. - She got me, too. - She got you, too. Man, I told you. She'll be my best friend even more when we play. Shit. - -Yo, Gibson, we got one on the loose. Chief... Now she could be the start of something special. Yeah. Now you know what it feels like to be a winner. Chief... - Chief, can you hear me? - Whatever does she's on, that's the one I want. Chief, Tia's on the run. Gibson, I see her. She's mine. Kiss. Tia. Tia. Tia! Come on now. Let's make this shit easy. Don't make me fucking hurt you, Tia. Rico, five feet back. - Down on your right. - Copy that. - Got her, Chief. - No! No! Come here. Thought you'd get away from me, huh? This is what I do. No! - Come on! Come on. - No! Where do you think you're going, huh? Come on. This is what I do. Come on. - Come on. - No! No! Stop resisting. Stop it. I got her, boss. You sure do, Rico. That's the warm blood going to your bowels, filling your bowels. That's right. Here we go. Here we go. If you breathe, it's better. If you breathe, it's better. You'll go faster. Let it happen. Come on. You got it. You got it. Come on. Just let it happen. Shh. Rico, you hit my girl. Guy's gotta draw the line somewhere. Chief. I did that for you. Chief, what the fuck happened? What happened to Rico? It was an accident. Tia killed him. I hate you! I did that for you. You did this to me! I did that for you. I did that for you. I love you. I did this whole thing for you. Nobody else, all of this shit for you! The whole fucking thing is for fucking you! This whole fucking thing is for you! You're a maniac! I want you. - You want me? - Yes. - You can't handle me. - Yes, I can. And you are not a fucking man. You are not a fucking man. We'll see. Casey. Get 'em in the cage. And when I give you the order, you clean Kiss up, you get her in the ring. It's time for me to show this little bitch what a trained solider can do on the serum. In the cage. In the cage. In the cage. Face the wall. Let's go. Move. This is love. Kiss. Grand champion. That girl can kick some motherfuckin' ass. Gibson, give that serum to a soldier with intelligence, and imagine what we could do out in the field. Imagine the money we're gonna make. I want the dosage that's in Kiss. I'm glad you brought that up. I know you guys traveled a long way to come out here and check this out. I know we got a lot on the line. Casey, prep Kiss. Where are you going now? Daddy's gotta go to work. I'm sorry. Please don't give up on me. It's time. Let's go. Kiss! Kiss! 15 years in the special forces. You don't deserve to fight me. You're just an experiment. I got the champ. Command. Kill them both. Two on one. Ow. Yes! Yes! Way to go, Beast. Kiss. Wanna bring her in, Chief? Stay right there, Casey. You can bring her in after I kill her. You running out of experiments? Want some of this? This woman too much for you, Gibson? Be a fucking man, then! Be a fucking man. - You're gonna OD on that shit, man. - Shut up! Be a fucking man. You lay down. You run when I tell you to run. If Gibson wins, I'll pay for the serum. If Kiss wins, you pay for it. Gibby's my boy. Of course. Deal. Well, that's... Don't be scared now. Don't be scared now. Stay right there, Casey. Don't make a fucking move. You fucking bastard. You can't count Kiss out just yet. Come on, Senator. It's game over. Come on. Get up. Come on, Kiss. Come on. I thought you were bad. I thought you're a badass. Nothing like a little foreplay. Oh, that's right. Yeah, girl. Kiss. You wanna do it the easy way. Right, this is it. Don't cry. Don't cry. Kiss. Badass bitch. Promise, run! Run! Kiss, what about you? - Run! Go, Promise! - Shit. Oh. That count as a win? It's a big win for all of us. I think it's time to take the serum to our partners. You know, for a minute there, I thought you're all about scratching this whole deal over cat fights. Well, looks like the ladies came out on top. It's been fun, General, but I have to fly back for a senate hearing on our new deal with China in the morning. Give Gibson a kiss for me. Is there some replay on this shit? Hey! Hey! Stop, please. Stop, please! Please come back! Please stop. Come on. Thank you. Thank you. It's going to be okay. I promise. This is warfare. You want soldiers to kill without guilt. This is the perfect fighting machine. The serum brings out pure primal instincts. Imagine what the serum can do to a solider who's been properly trained. The limits? Endless. That's what I want. Soldiers with intelligence. Kiss. Now, she could be the start of something special. Badass bitch. Subtitles by explosiveskull
