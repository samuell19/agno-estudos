♪ In a time long past ♪ ♪ A Noh theater troupe took the world by storm ♪ No. Not that theater troupe. This was a long, long, long... long... long time ago. The time of our ancestors, when Noh theater was known as "sarugaku." Japan was divided between two emperors. Each emperor had their own court, and claimed to be the rightful ruler of the entire nation. In the Northern Court, the shogun yearned for three sacred treasures, known as the Imperial Regalia, ownership of which would determine the one true emperor. Ah. If only I just had one of them. Even one sacred treasure! If only... ♪ If only he had one treasure ♪ ♪ If only, if only ♪ ♪ He must have that treasure ♪ ♪ He must have the sacred treasure ♪ A tale that took place in this country 600 years ago. Our story, which was stolen away from us, and forgotten. Huh? Who are those people? What are they here for? Do you know? No. What about you? Have you heard anything? Not from down here. What did you find? Nothing but junk! You've got visitors! Tie it up! Something big must be going on. I just hope they're not here to cause any trouble. Could be good news. We'd appreciate your help. This is the location. Right here. Our family has been diving for Heike treasure here in Dan-no-ura for 60 years. I doubt we're gonna find anything like that still down there. I assure you we will. It's in a bag inside of a box as tall as you or I, covered in clay. It looks nothing like treasure. So, you've seen it? Someone saw it. It came in a dream. Someone from a hidden Heike village? Are you going to help us or not? Hmm. Huh? They're so creepy. Yeah, we have a lot of angry-looking crabs like that one around here. When they're under the water, they hide their faces from you. Sent by the curse of the fallen Heike clan, no doubt. Superstition! The curse only affects things when they come out of the water. Papa! Where'd you go? - Forgive us! - Forgive us! Papa! Papa! I can't see! Where are you? What happened to those two men from Kyoto? They ran off. They just left after all that? Unbelievable. Well, did they at least pay? My husband is dead and my son is blind! How could this have happened?! Who were they? Who were the men who did this? Who? Why? Tell me why! Why?! That's right, Tomona. Find who's responsible. I'm counting on you. You're the only one who can set me free. You must avenge me. You must avenge the whole Io family. Find the bastards who did this to us. And cut them down. The rule of the Heike had come to an end. Flags had been pushed back, by the white flags belonging to the Genji. It was the final battle on the sea of Dan-no-ura. The emperor's grandmother got to her feet. And spoke to the six-year-old that was her grandson. "There is a city beneath the waves. The Palace of the Dragon King." So the young emperor left, carrying the sacred sword of the Imperial Regalia, jumped over the edge of the ship, and plunged into the water below. Never to return. None know if he found the Dragon King's palace. Or if the palace was ever there. Aah! My face! D-Don't touch me! Hey, I know that story. The sword that sank to the bottom of Dan-no-ura. I know it! Well, of course you know it. Everybody knows the story of how the Heike were defeated. It's quite famous. Why are you sitting here singing about it? To bring peace to the fallen warriors. Soothing their souls is the reason my colleagues and I are here. Look. Itsukushima sanctuary's over there. I'm sorry, I can't see it because I'm blind. Is that right? So are we! You're blind, but you know how to play the biwa? Playing the biwa is how we earn a living. Tell me, what's your name? I'm Tomona. I'm looking for the hidden villages of the Heike. I'm from Dan-no-ura. This is my name. Here. "Taniichi." You can read? Of course I can read. Everyone in my family can... Oh, see if you can read that stone marker. You've found your way to Itsukushima! The shrine on the sea built long ago by the Heike commander, Kiyomori. Hard to believe he's blind. I've been traveling with this boy since he left Dan-no-ura two years ago. Oh, you've come a long way, then. Tomona here is searching for the hidden villages of the Heike. He believes there are untold stories to be found there. I wouldn't mind finding them myself, if I can. Best be careful with that. The last biwa priests who uncovered new Heike stories are gone now. Cut down. In the middle of the streets of the capital. Dozens of them. And not one survived. Is that so? Some might call that a bad omen. And the culprit still hasn't been found, either. They say it was some kind of bloodthirsty spirit. Well, we must be careful then. Ah! Stop! That tickles! No, no, no! Can't you get it right?! When I'm gone, you two will inherit leadership of the Hie-za! To do that, you must be the best! Do it again! No! No! From the top! Again! Huh? Huh? Uh, uh, uh... Ah... wow. Huh! Ha ha! Yeah! The hell?! What is that thing? A child? It can't be. - A gourd? - Worn as a mask? Oh, look at all these kids. I-I'm gonna grab 'em, and I'm gonna take 'em with me! Yeah! Whoa! Creepy. What the hell is it? - Goodness me! - It's not human! That smell brings back memories. It's been a long while. Over ten years since - I last came to the capital. - Welcome back. That odor is the smell of constant conflict and arson. Nothing ever seems to change. The Ashikaga Shogun does not have a strong hold - on this region. Ah! - Here ya go. The delightful smell of the capital, I can't get enough! Enjoy. - Get on with it! - Now! Come on. Let's go! - Pull! Pull! Pull! - Go! It's been settled. He may now use "ichi" in his name. Thank you so much, Master. - Hasuichi. - Yes. Every biwa priest that's a member of this guild takes the "ichi" from Master Kakuichi's name. Tomona will now be known as Tomoichi. No, no! You can't do that! Uh, what do you mean I can't? Tomona? Who are you talking to? Uh, no one at all. Okay, what's the problem? If you change your name, I won't be able to find you. Your name is all I can see. The only way I can join the guild is for them to call me Tomoichi. But your name is Tomona! You're Tomona of Dan-no-ura! Who?! Why?! Tell me why! You gotta set us free. Use those arms and legs. Avenge your family! Huh? - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! W-What is that?! A gourd?! It took my sword! Behold the dreadful gourd. It's some kind of monster! I've got your sword! - Get away! - You want it? - Give it back! - Come and get it. It's right here. You monster! I am the invincible gourd. Hey, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move! Hey! You're in the gourd's way! Move! I'm warning you. Don't make me take my mask off. You're wearing a mask? Yeah. What happens when you take it off? You'll see. You're in for a shock! - Well? - Have you taken the mask off? Yeah. This is my face. What do you think? Take a good hard look. I can't see. - Huh? - Yeah, sorry. That means, I didn't need the mask to begin with? Uh, I guess not. Ooh, a biwa! Do you know how to play it? Hmm. Of course. - You're good. - I know. Never heard this one. I just play what I hear. - I love it! - Well, then it's not over. Here. - Got a name? - Yeah, it's called manju. Mmm. Good, right? It is. But I was asking what your name is. Eh, what's yours? - My name is... - Tomona! Your name is Tomona! My name is Tomona. Or, uh, I guess, Tomoichi. Who? Why? Tell me why! Who?! Why?! - Tell me why! - Oh, you're with Kakuichi, huh? He's got ties with the shogun, so that group will just keep growing. So what's your name? - I don't have one. - Huh? You don't have a name? What do they call you? Huh. Nobody calls me anything. See ya around, Tomoichi. Or is it Tomona? Tomoichi, I think. Tomoichi! Because I'm with the Kakuichi guild! H-Hey! Hold on! How do I find you if you don't have a name? What am I supposed to call you?! I've actually picked a name for myself. Huh? You picked your own name? Yeah! I know exactly what I'm going to call myself! And some day the world will know it. 'Cause I'll be the star of the Hie-za! A delightful performance, Teiichi. It pleases me and my late grandfather, as well. Although I'm certain he's getting impatient with my failed efforts to unify the Northern and Southern Courts. I have faith that you'll succeed someday soon, Lord Yoshimitsu. Good of you to come, Kan'ami. Fujiwaka. Thank you, Shogun, for having us. It is our greatest honor and privilege to perform for you and your late grandfather. We cannot express the extent of our joy. Well, then why don't you start the performance? The music is exquisite. And I'm sure the dance is as well. Kan'ami and Fujiwaka are said to be the best sarugaku performers in the entire world. I thought I'd heard that of the Hie-za. Hie-za is for the masses, but Kanze is for those of culture. That much is evident by the shogun's fondness for Fujiwaka's skill and beauty. You look like frogs wrestling! How can you hope to compete with Fujiwaka?! - We're sorry, father! - Sorry! - Forgive us, please! - Apology not accepted! Sorry! So Sorry! You must practice like your lives depend on it! Do it again! It's not enough. It has to be beautiful! The ultimate beauty. - Yes, Father! - Of course, Father! Uh... - Father! - Father! What do you think you're practicing for? You'll never perform on a stage with that unsightly arm of yours! You're a hideous monster! Hmm. I've never understood it. My back is covered in scales. And my mouth isn't where it should be. Neither are my eyes. I can't even see through a normal mask. But check out this arm! Who else can do things like this? But I can't perform with the Hie-za because of the way I look. Oh, stop complaining. Legs. Chest. Belly. Every time I perform a new dance, it seems... another part of my body changes as if it's being set free. What do you suppose that's all about? Hmm. Sounds to me like a curse. - A curse? - Could be the work of spirits. Oh, that may be what it looks like, but I sure don't know any spirits. Of course you don't, neither do I. Wait. Yes, I do! There's one spirit I can talk to. Papa! Are you there? Papa! It's Tomoichi! How've you been?! Hello! Wait? Can you see him or what? Oh, right, he can't find me because of this name. Papa! It's Tomona! Tomona of Dan-no-ura! It's your son! Papa! Are you out there?! Can you hear me?! - Tomona? - Whoa. You're so small. How have you been? I'm a spirit. What kind of question is that? Good point. I told you if you changed your name I couldn't find you. Huh? You are Tomona of Dan-no-ura! You probably don't know but your mother passed away. But she's moved on. She died in peace. She did? I'm glad to hear that. I don't think I can stick around much longer. - So take care of yourself! - Wait just a moment. There's something I need to ask you! Are there any spirits around here? - You're looking at one. - Yeah, I know. Any others? Uh, okay. Hmm. Yes, there are. They're all around us. Are there any around him? There are many. Heike samurai possessing him because they can't rest. Heike spirits? Heike? All right, take care now. I hear them. C-Can you hear them? This is amazing! - Can you see them? - Yeah. In fact, I think I've been hearing their voices ever since the day I was born. So, what's troubling you? Tell me! I'm listening. Huh? Oh-ho-ho. Oh-ho-ho! Ah, ah. Incredible! I know exactly what you're saying. I'll listen to your stories. One at a time. I'll listen to every one of them. Your stories will finally be heard! Bear with me, I have a new tale I'd like to sing for all of you today. - A new tale? - Did he say new? - He's acting strange. - Look at his hair. What's that smell? It's the scent of a prostitute. You're about to hear a story of a man. A man who was searching for buried tales of the Heike. Hmm? Hie-za? - That's what I heard. - Is that true? Does he really have another son? Who is he? I thought Hie-za was at the shrine. Yeah, they are. At least that's where the old man's performing. So who's at this bridge in Rokujo? Someone else? Does the leader have a third son? Competing against his father? - A showdown. - Yeah. Let's go. That's Hie-za's leader. Wrong place. They said it was under the bridge. At the river? Another Hie-za performance. - I-I hear it's really good. - Let's get over there. Hurry up! My name is Inu-oh. "The Burial Mound of Arms." By me. Here we go! In 1184, at the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani. Heike Commander Tadanori's right arm was chopped off below the elbow. As was his head! Ow! Let me see your hands! Put your fists in the air! Hey, hey... Now clap! Huh? - Inu-oh? - Yeah. The guy can move like nothing you've ever seen before. And he has the best voice I've ever heard. He gets the whole audience to clap their hands and move to the beat and sometimes everyone sings along. Hie-za's leader is good but he's no Inu-oh. That's right, the old man is old news. Inu-oh's too exciting. I can't wait to go see Inu-oh. - Truly amazing. - I had a lot of fun. He gets the whole crowd to go wild. He never takes off his mask. From what I hear, you can't find anything like it anywhere else. The spirits of fallen warriors dance and sing along. Spirits? The Heike tell their stories through him and dance with him. Well, that is new. And the music is great. It's got a strong beat, it's so captivating! So good! It really makes you want to dance. It's Inu-oh! We have to go to Kiyomizu! It's Inu-oh! He's from Hie-za, too, and he's performing! Yeah! - Let's go see Inu-oh! - Inu-oh's the best! Ah! Ow! Hey, you. Hey. Are you seeing this? You're watching, aren't you? Yeah. I can see you, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah! Ow! - There you are. - I couldn't wait. - We dance along with him, right? - Rumor has it he's cursed. Look! "The Whale." By Inu-oh. 1185, Dan-no-ura. Heike Chief Commander Munemori sees Genji troops approaching, and calls for a diviner. Inu-oh! Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! Your turn! Yeah! Sing it! Ha ha! Come on! Everybody now! Inu-oh! Inu-oh! - Munemori! - Munemori! Hey! Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Munemori! - Munemori! - Munemori! Mun-e-mori! - Munemori! - Munemori! - Munemori! - Hey! Sing it! Ow! Yeah! Why is he calling himself Inu-oh? And how could he do this?! I'm supposed to be the star of the Hie-za! The whole thing was my creation! All of its accomplishments belong to me! Who told him all these new stories? Where could he have found them?! It's not biwa anymore, he's taken it too far. Tomoichi's getting carried away. And he wears makeup, dresses like a prostitute. He's giving us a bad name. Polluting what we stand for. It's unforgivable! I can't believe he's letting his hair grow so long. It's unbecoming. Biwa priests shave their heads. Have you seen them? - No. But I've heard. - Master Teiichi! I would love to see it. See how far they'll go. I find it very exciting, don't you? You won't even remove your mask at a party? Don't you know Inu-oh's story? Apparently he's hideous. Oh, that's just a publicity stunt, it's all part of the show. You, sir, are correct. W-Wha...? The story of Inu-oh is fiction. In truth, the face hiding under this mask is devastatingly handsome. If that's so, then why hide it under the mask? Why wouldn't I? Because even my handsome face... is just another mask. What does that mean? It means everything is fiction. So are you handsome under there or not? Surely we won't have to wait much longer to find out, will we? What's the rush? Don't you wanna drink? I don't care for parties. You should get a new biwa. How long are you going to keep strumming that old beetle? I happen to like this biwa. You know, I think I finally get it. The Heike spirits aren't a curse. They're not trying to make me suffer. All they want is... to let the world know they were here. I think they just want to be acknowledged. That's all they're after. And we're helping. And I'll keep going. I'll sing their songs, and tell their stories. That's how we honor their memory. It seems like the more hell we raise, the louder they get when they cry out in joy. They're just saying, "We're here." We are here, aren't we? Inu-oh, I've decided. I'll keep singing "The Inu-oh Chapters." I'll spread them everywhere. But I'm going to do it under a new name. Tomoari. Tomo... ari? Yeah. A name that means: "We're here." You and me, we're both right here. Ha. Oh... I like that. Music that will get you on your feet and make your body move! Biwa and taiko like you've never heard! They're the talk of the town: the troupe of Tomoari! Twists and turns galore! These are "The Inu-oh Chapters"! Sit back, and enjoy the show! What's this new biwa music I'm hearing about? That's the Tomoari troupe. He decided to leave our guild and create his own. His innovative music is gaining quite the following all across the country. I wonder how far and wide it will... That's no good. No good at all. We will be unifying the courts very soon. Before long, the Imperial Regalia will finally be ours. And when that happens, the shogunate's power must be undisputably absolute. Master Kakuichi's tale of the Heike will be the only version people hear. Uh... The stories everyone knows already. We'll be just fine without any new ones. Uh... The last thing we need is for a new movement to start up. The people need to put all their faith in the Ashikaga. Is that clear, Teiichi? Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu will be holding a party in Kitayama soon. He's expressed his desire for the Hie-za to perform. I am unworthy of such a great honor. To be invited to perform for the shogun himself, after dedicating so many years to my craft... No, not you. Inu-oh. But, sir. I am the lead performer of the Hie-za. As I understand it, Inu-oh's following has grown much larger than yours. The request for Inu-oh comes from Nariko, the shogun's wife. Otherwise, I'm sure the Kanze troupe would've been invited as usual. Because Kanze is the shogun's favorite style, after all. There's something you must tell me. Rumor has it that hiding under the mask Inu-oh wears is the hideous face of a monster. We'd like to know if that's true. - He's, um... - Because you should know, Lady Nariko is with child right now. And we have to take that into consideration. She's in no condition to see anything disturbing. If anything were to happen to her, the person responsible would have to be executed on the spot. Do we understand each other? Yes, that makes all the sense in the world. - Inu-oh, that's amazing! - The shogun himself. The shogun has made one more demand of you, and it's very important to him. You must perform your final act without the mask. He says he wishes to see the face that's hidden beneath it. He's used to watching Kanze performances, and Fujiwaka is so handsome, he often dances without a mask at all. Yes, but Inu-oh can't! And if I refuse? Then they'll rescind the offer. But if they see how hideous your face is, you may lose your head entirely. Hmm. - You're better off not... - I understand. I'll accept. - And I'll do as he says. - Uh... On one condition. I want a biwa player. Ow! He's taking his mask off at the end. I hear he's quite handsome. He's finally going to show his face. - The mask is coming off. - I hear he's hideous. We're about to find out. All will be revealed. You hear he's taking off his mask in the final act? We're going to see his real face. I can hardly wait. What an honor for a biwa priest to perform at an event like this. It seems Master Teiichi taught his student well. - Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! - Look over here! - Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! Do you think we're going to see the dragon this time? Please don't get so excited, my dear. You're in a delicate condition. But Inu-oh is about to perform for us. How can I sit still? Everybody loves him! From commoners to aristocrats and even the samurai! You should support him more. You want to keep him on our side. Better than obsessing over Fujiwaka. The spirits are more excited than usual. They know it ends here. This is it. Either they finally find their peace, or I lose my head. Either way, it's over. For us, this could be our last show. Come on. We're only just getting started here. The spirits will find peace soon enough, but we've still got a long way to go. Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! - Inu-oh! No matter what happens, you and I are both right here. Everyone put a fist in. Now let's do this! Yeah! "The Dragon Commander." By Inu-oh. The moon's getting close to the sun. We cannot allow you to go out there. This is Hie-za's stage right now. What's wrong? The spirits aren't moving on. - Why? - What are we missing? Why can't they find peace? There's another story. One we still need to find. The stories of the regalia are true. There really is a curse. We'll just have to keep it hidden. This is what the shogun needs. To unify our nation. It's terrifying. But he can't bring the courts together without the regalia. I already know this story. Show me Inu-oh's. No, no, no! It's not enough! This isn't what I want! What is it you do want? What do you desire? I want... I want to be the greatest star alive! If that is your wish... I shall give you special stories to tell. In the secret villages where the last of the Heike survive... they are hidden. Tales of greatness beyond your wildest dreams. Sealed away from the world. The biwa priests have been there, and uncovered these stories. But they can be yours if you so desire. A simple trade: one story for each priest. They're mine. They're all mine! Mine and mine alone! It's not enough. It's still not enough. I need you to give me more stories! I'd be happy to. For a price. Give me the radiant innocence of your unborn child. You can't! That is all I ask of you. No, don't! Go on, take it. You can have whatever you want! Stop! He'll die! Inu-oh will die! How could you do this? Help him! Somebody! Please! Someone help! - We found it. - Yes, we did. Did you see it? Yeah. Everything. No. This isn't right. I should be on that stage! Why? Why not me?! Why that monster?! I'm the star! I should shine the brightest! What's the matter? Are you not the brightest star? I'm not, but I should be! This is all wrong! Then tell me: do you wish for more? Of course I do! Get rid of that monster! Are you referring to the child you gave to me? Yes! Destroy him! Get rid of that monster now! You made a promise to me. Are you taking it back? You're telling me to destroy what you've already given to me. It is you who shall be destroyed instead. - Hurry up, let's go! - This way! Today, by decree of the shogun, Tomoari's troupe is disbanded! These so-called new Heike songs are an affront to his glory! - Master Tomoari! - Move it! Get out of the way! Stand back! Move! Out of the way! - Everyone stand back! - Quiet! Hear this: Kakuichi's troupe is the only guild recognized by the shogun! From now on, only the official songs are permitted to be performed! Please, no! We ask forgiveness! Wha...? Master Teiichi! - Watch it! - Master Teiichi! Master Teiichi! Master Teiichi! Tomoari? It's my troupe. The samurai are after them! Why aren't we allowed to sing our songs anymore? What did we do to deserve this? Master Kakuichi has completed the definitive book of the Heike. From now on, the only stories we can tell are the ones that are written in that book. But what was wrong with our songs? This is the will of the shogunate. No. Those songs are Inu-oh's stories. And my story is singing them; they're ours! How can they just take them away from us?! Tomoari, I understand you're upset, but change your name and come back to us. My name is Tomoari! I chose it for myself for a reason. Because "We are here!" Inu-oh has agreed to this. He will never perform the new Heike, nor will he tell his own story ever again. - Don't fight it. - Liar! I don't believe you. Those are our stories! Those songs belong to us! - Tomo! - He's made his choice. Tomoari! No! - Tomoari! - No! No, no! Your troupe is hereby disbanded. - No, no, no, no, no, no! - And you are under arrest. - Come with us! - No! Let's go! Hurry, tell them. Tell them you're Tomoichi now. Do not resist! This is Tomoichi! Of the Kakuichi guild! Stop the violence. Come now, Master Kakuichi's in charge here. Please stop! He won't perform any music that's not in the book again! My name is Tomoari! And I tell the stories of the lost spirits! Tomoichi! Your name is Tomoichi! You have to tell them! - Hurry! - Just stop! I will not let you take our stories away! - No. - Taniichi? - Taniichi? - Tani... He got in the way. - Taniichi! - Taniichi! Taniichi! My brother! How could you do this? - I am Tomoari! - Stop! Tomoichi! - I won't run away and hide! - Stop. - I decide what my name is! - Stop. Stop this, Tomoichi! No one else! No one! No one can take that away from me! Stop, please! Please! Let me go. Let me go! Let me go! Taniichi! Brothers! We finally have flowers here that dance as beautifully as you do, Inu-oh. My lord. Your performance was incredibly powerful. Truthfully, it was too magnificent for this world. You are most kind, my lord. However, Inu-oh, your Heike stories take too many liberties. No more of that. You my use only Kakuichi's stories from now on. With all due respect, Shogun, the stories I perform are... Tomoari's troupe has been disbanded. The songs of Inu-oh must not be performed. Therefore, the biwa priests who perform them must be stopped. You understand. To attain unity, we must first have order. Do not see that biwa priest again. And what happens if I refuse to surrender the stories that I lived and suffered for? Do you wish to see that priest of yours beheaded? Of course, I'll gladly forget about them all. No one shall hear those stories ever again. As for the priest, he and I are finished, as well. From now on, my lord, I will only perform for you. Inu-oh is yours. I'll dance for your eyes only. Splendid. I'd hate to be deprived of seeing you dance. My lord! Who's out there? I-I don't know, sir. What's that you've got in your hand? Hmm. That biwa priest wants me to take him to the shogun's grave. Hmm? Don't let anyone know you spoke to him. Tomona of Dan-no-ura! ♪ A long, long time ago ♪ ♪ How long has it been? ♪ ♪ So long, longer than we know ♪ I don't know how long it's been. But I'm here, and have been, for so long. I've been looking for you. For 600 years. You're Tomona again. No wonder it was so hard to find you. Here you are. You chose that name for yourself, didn't you? Because we're both here, right? Remember, Tomoari? Inu... You still have that old beetle? Can you play it? Of course I can. - Nice. - I know. Nothing's changed. - Not at all. - This is great. Let's keep it going! Inu-oh! Tomoari! Inu-oh! Tomoari! Inu-oh! Tomoari! Inu-oh! Tomoari!
