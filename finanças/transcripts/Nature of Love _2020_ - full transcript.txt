When I agreed to it, the journalist assured me that it would be about my conservation work, which is why I was doing the hike in the first place, but in the end, he was more interested in plugging the gear I was using, and let's just say it's taught me to be wary of journalists, and to make sure that in future, I keep myself out of the story. Huh. So, what brings you here? Oh, uh, I'm here to widen my horizons. I'm not exactly an outdoorsy type person, unless you count sitting on sidewalk patios. Well, they do call the city a jungle.

Then we'll plan. I can do that. How long do we... Shh... Yeah. Right. Hmm... Wow. Sorry. It's okay. It does take your breath away. Every time. Now, for a plan, how about a horseback ride? Oh, no. Uh, definitely not. I like to keep my feet firmly planted on the ground. When was the last time you did something for the first time? Uh... Last week, I tried the spicy tuna roll instead of the regular tuna roll, so... [laughs] ...but I did go riding once. I begged my parents to send me to horseback-riding camp, and then I...

That was what my first camp counselor used to tell us. He was Navajo, and taught me things I couldn't learn just from books. Hmm. So what about a rookie like me, it doesn't get old? Not at all.

Okay. ♪ ♪ Looking for eagles? I usually see them over those trees, a male and a female. Their nest is just past that tree line. That's where they raise their eaglets. Eaglets? Is that really the name for baby eagles? You've never heard that before? No. That's too adorable. There they are. [Katie] They're amazing. They truly are. They use the same nest every year, and since they mate for life, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. It's like a testament to their commitment for each other It's like the eagle equivalent of those yearly anniversary gifts? My mom's really into those. Like, um, paper for year one, cotton...

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean... That's okay. It's actually a pretty fitting description. I guess, this place offered me the best of both worlds. Here, I get to meet people, like yourself, and educate guests on the importance of conservation, or more importantly, help you love nature so that you want to conserve it, and then, in the off season, I still get to go and... be a journeyman. What about you? What do you do when you're not expanding your horizons? I spend a lot of time in front of a computer. Programming? Uh, no, writing. Like, short, little 20-word blurbs, we call them. It's nothing special. It's a form of advertising. I'm not surprised you're a writer. I read the descriptions you wrote of the birds. I could really see them. Well, I love it, and I'd really love the opportunity to write more than just 20 words. Did you grow up in all this? Doing all this outdoorsy stuff? Believe it or not, I was a city kid. - Really? - Mm-hmm. [in Southern U.S. accent] I figured you were born on the frontier, with your mama making grits on a cast-iron pan. Wow, you really are a storyteller... [laughing] ...but, no. The only thing my parents knew about camping was that it rhymed with bears. That doesn't rhyme. Exactly. They didn't have a clue. Got it. But one year, I went to summer camp, and everything changed. - How old were you? - 11. So it was a few years before I was able to say goodbye to the big city. Eventually I became a camp counselor, spent some time studying birds in different regions, plus a few years on a ranch, my cowboy phase. Of course, of course. I had more of a "watch every episode of Friends"phase. [laughs] My dad was a professor, and my mom was a corporate lawyer, so our weekends were books and fundraisers, and other than my short stint as a cowgirl on that horseback-riding camp, I must admit that this is my second time in the wilderness. How do you like it so far? I think... it's pretty awesome. Wow. [email whooshes] [Penny] So, you caught this fish? I did. Everything turn out okay? Wait, you cooked this? Didn't I tell you I was also the chef? What? I'm kidding. That's a hat Chase wears very well. Enjoy. Oh, Will, um... join us, please. I would love to get some more pointers on how to catch one of these. Okay. Or pointers on any of the other hundred things you seem to do so well. [Olivia] A hundred? That may be an exaggeration. 99 maybe. Hardly. Put me in front of a computer, and tell me how clever I seem then, huh? You did almost wipe out the guest database. [Will] See? It's okay, though, we'll let it slide. There is one thing I would like him to do. I can't imagine he would disappoint. What is it? Ice skating. Really? Well, I could help in that department. Figure skating and ballet were prerequisites in my world. [Olivia] Well, believe me, I am still trying to change his mind. I'm on the rink all winter long. I'm more of a skiing kind of guy. One of these days, we're gonna get you on the ice. Good luck with that. Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies, I have a group scheduled. [Penny] So are all the guides as good as he is? [Olivia] Well, he's by far the best, but the good news is we're going to have him full-time now, instead of just for the summers. Oh? Yeah, we just had plans and funding approved to expand and build a hotel on the grounds, and he's going to come in and help with the project. You know, advising on the environmental impact. Like, an actual hotel? - Mm-hmm. - Wow. It is a big deal, we're very excited. Will is, too? He has strong opinions, but he's going to make sure that we do it the right way. Well, no doubt. Must be hard being apart during the off-season. [Olivia] Winters are long. Well, if you would excuse me, ladies. There's some fresh blueberry pie. Would you like a slice? I am full, thank you. Me, too. Okay, enjoy. Subtle. It was. She had no clue. Well... now we have a clue. That they're together? No, my friend, that was vague at best. Doesn't matter if Will's into it or not. Clearly, Olivia is, and I'm not gonna step in on that. That's... It doesn't matter if it's official or not. [Sabrina] Katie... I love the photos. Do you think this Will would do a cover? Um...

Well, are they gonna remove the tents? No. It'll just be a small hotel, but... different. Right. Well, Olivia seemed really happy about it all, and having you here, and... Yeah, it would mean a lot to her. And... to you? To be honest, I have a hike lined up for later in the year. A hike? The Appalachian Trail. What? Mm-hmm. And I guess Olivia can't come with you because of the hotel, or? That was never a possibility. She has a business to run. Right, so you would have to give up the hike to take the job? Yeah, and I've already got sponsors lined up, so it would be a lot to walk away from. Whew, that is a hard decision. It is. You know, you might not believe this, but my favorite book growing up was about this brother and sister who lived in a magical cabin in the Appalachians... And their dad took them hiking. And taught them to never get lost by looking at the stars? Yeah, and they had a dog. Yeah, I loved that book! Me too. It was one of my favorite adventure stories. What? What was the dog's name?

[Will] So tell me about your writing. [Katie] There's really isn't much more to tell. Where do you get your inspirations from? What are you passionate about writing? Well, I guess when I was younger, I wanted to be a storybook writer, and then I got my degree in English, and got this job writing blurbs, and... honestly, since then, all I've ever thought about was getting to write more than 20 words, so... I guess I should give that some more thought, huh? Can you describe this to me? This moment? Out here? And it can be more than 20 words. Let's see. Mountains made up of... all the shades of the seasons, surround a lake so pristine that it acts as a mirror reflecting the mountain's beautiful face. That was beautiful. You try. All right. I'll give it a try. On a day like this, normally, I would be itching to hit the trails, cut a solitary wake through the lake... that one rhymes... [chuckles] Nice. But in this moment, I'm grateful. Grateful to be able to share all this beauty with someone special. Look, otters. Five months, huh? I am not be that brave. Maybe one day. [Katie] Okay, so this is the best kind of tired, huh? [Will] Yup, "a full, fun day" kind of tired. You should take a break, and I'll see you tonight. There's a great event planned for the meteor shower. Meteor shower? It happens every summer. The whole camp cooks together, we eat, we dance, and then we settle in for some serious stargazing. Back up. You dance? What? Why so surprised? Oh, nothing, I just... I figured a guy who spends so much time on his own hiking and climbing... And what do you think I do when I reach the end of one of those hikes or the top of the mountain? I dance, of course. Really? Mm... No, you don't... Oh, god, why do I keep falling for you? [laughs] ...It. Falling for it, I meant. - I know. - Okay. [laughs] - I'll see you at 7:00. - Okay, yeah. ♪ ♪ [Chase] That's right, we don't ever want to cut into the meat until it's been cooked and well rested, and at this point, we want to gently pat in all of the seasonings, kind of like you're giving it a massage.

[applause] [Chase] Thank you. Thomas, have you up here. Excellent. Now, this time, I want to demonstrate how we get it all the way to the edges... Wow. He's incredible, isn't he? I told you, we are very lucky to have him on our team. Yeah, no, he's absolutely incredible. [Chase] Now let's flip 'em, we'll get the other side, and once that's done, we'll throw 'em on the grill, and that'll be tonight's dinner. You know that was about a 12-ounce steak. Yeah, and I have zero guilt, because I canoed an entire lake and back today. Wish I could say the same, but I only sweat off my pounds in the sauna today. [laughs] Oh, my gosh, look. Pure perfection.

I've never seen anything like it. Hot chocolate? Yes, please. Penny? Actually, I'm going to go talk to Chase, and see what cuts of steak he recommends, but thank you. Bye. See ya. You want to sit? It's so easy to forget about stars when you live in the city. I think I can see, like, three from my apartment. [chuckles] Oh, is this one of those moments, that's best spent in silence? It can be... [chuckling] but when I was at camp, my counselor, Atsa, whose name meant "eagle," he would tell us star stories. Tell me. Well, I'm not as great at telling stories as you or Atsa. I mean, he had a way to make his stories really resonate and stick with you. Don't worry. I think, um... I think I'll remember this. Well, my favorite story was the one about Nanook. It's an Inuit legend. He was a bear. A great big white polar bear, and one day, he was out on the ice, searching for food, when a bunch of dogs started chasing him, and he ran as fast as he could, but they kept chasing him, and he ran, and ran, and ran, and he ran so far, he didn't realize he had reached the edge of the world, and he slid right off into the night sky... and there he is. [Katie] He became a star. That's right. See? There's his tail, and his legs. [Katie] Oh, yeah. I think I can see him. They understood that we just share all of this, this whole universe. When you're out on your long hikes, um... does it ever feel like you're at the edge of the world? Like, does it not get lonely? It does. So does that mean that you have or want somebody to share it with? Like a Jane to your Tarzan? [chuckles] Sure. Really? I always figured you were fine being a lone wolf. Let me put it this way. I'd rather be a lone wolf than share it with the wrong person. Because you're right, sometimes, it does feel like you're at the end of the Earth, and when you're in a place like that, you want to make sure you're there with someone you'd be happy to step off the edge with. [exhales] Those are pretty powerful words. I had a good teacher. So this Appalachian hike, are you gonna alone on that? That was the plan, but things change. Oh? Like this hotel deal or? That, and other things. 'Cause the universe is funny like that. You never know what it's going to bring you. [Olivia] Who's bringing what? Um... Oh, we're just, uh... we're just talking about Will's long hikes, and whether he likes to go solo or with someone. Oh, he goes alone. Well, that's not necessarily true. Well, it doesn't matter anyway, since you canceled that Appalachian Trail one. Well, that's... not actually true. What? You didn't cancel it? [Will] No, I told you I was still deciding. You know what, guys, I think I'm just gonna go, um... I'm gonna... see if they have more hot chocolate. Still deciding? What's there to decide on? It's a great opportunity. It's more than that, and you know it. Look, I know you have reservations about the idea of the hotel, but we can make it work, all of it. The water, the wildlife... everything. Because certainly you wouldn't choose the hike, would you? Go out into the woods again, alone? Over the... job? I'm sorry, Olivia, I honestly don't know. [Katie] "Will is a man looking for someone to step off the edge of the world with." Oh, boy. Sounds like an online dating profile.

So you seemed like you were on quite the mission today. Oh... Yeah, you could say that. I mean, I had to bolster all my courage to do it, but I was motivated. It's amazing what you can accomplish when you put your mind to it. - Like your Appalachian hike? - Exactly. Because when the going gets tough, it has to come from in here. Hmm. I guess you could say that about a lot of things. Like my writing, for example. I was so focused on the word count, I never thought about why I was writing. I just wanted the job. It's led me down a path that I never wanted it to go. I'm working on it. That's great. Yeah, I just hope I can fix it. Okay. Are you ready for this? [Will] Mm-hmm. Ta-dah! [crunching] What do you think? It's really good. Here, you should try it. All right. [crunching] It's really good. You know, this week's been amazing. I mean, every week here is pretty great, but this week... I'm going to remember it... Me too. ...and seeing as tomorrow is your last day, I think we should do something special. I agree. Um, I actually want to try something. I want to get back in the saddle. Really? Don't worry, I'll make sure you're safe. Thank you. - Hey! - Penny, hi. Don't mind me, just walking back to my tent. No, no, no, come sit down. You've got to try some of these s'mores. You actually do, and you can have my spot because I have a ride to plan for tomorrow. Good night, Katie. Good night, Will. Good night, Penny. Sweet dreams. Sorry for interrupting. Oh, no, no, no, you didn't interrupt anything. I mean, he did say he was gonna remember this week. Which means he's gonna miss you when you're gone. [chuckles nervously] So he'll miss me, he'll get over it. You know, he's got all this, he's got his hike, and Olivia's here... Which means nothing because he wants you. Penny, he lives in the woods. I live in a one-bedroom in a concrete jungle. I've seen worse odds. Have you? Because feelings aside, there is still the issue of my article, which I am trying to redirect back to what it was supposed to be, but if my boss doesn't go for it, and publishes it, and it's all about Will, then that's it. It won't matter if I live in a treehouse above his tent. He's not gonna want to have anything to do with me. So then tell him. Tell him the truth about why you're here, and how things have changed. Oh, I don't know. I don't know that he'd understand. Well, he's going to learn the truth at some point, regardless of which article your boss publishes. So don't you want to be the one to tell him? [sighs] The thought of telling him... it's way scarier than anything I've had to do. That, my friend, is love. Katie, I'm sorry, I picked up your message late last night. That's fine, don't worry about it. I'm actually on my way out to go horseback riding. I'm conquering my biggest fear. Doesn't that make for a great story? Ooh... are you going with our hunky guide? I... I am, yeah, yeah, but that's not really the point. The point is that this city girl is crushing it. Well, actually, Will is the point of the story now, and I need you to get a picture of him on that horse, and try to find out more about what makes him tick. Okay, um... Look, here's the deal, Will likes to keep a low profile. Well, you're a journalist, or you want to be, right? Yup. Yeah, I do. Great. Get some answers. Oh, I gotta run. Make your last day count. [Katie] So the article in the Trail Magazine, I know that it wasn't ideal, but wasn't it at least good exposure? [Will] It would have been if it wasn't about me, and more about all the work that needs to be done to protect this place. There they are. Hi, um... Okay, you know what, I don't think I really need to do this... Come on, I promise, they don't bite. Put your trust in them, and they'll trust you.

No, you know what, actually great. Look at me, I'm doing this! Yes, you are, Katie. We'll go on foot from here. [Katie] Okay, where are you taking me? [Will] You'll see. Here we are. Where are we? Are we still on Peaks land? We are, just on the very outskirts. Not too many people know about this part of the property because, thankfully, it's undeveloped. Virtually untouched. As it should be. It's so beautiful. [Will] Welcome to Lavender Grove. And none of the other guests know it's here? No, Olivia's been very diligent about keeping it a secret, because she and I both know that the most beautiful land is also the most vulnerable land. Hmm. Yeah. [whispers] Ah, that scent... gives me a vision of a warm blossom, nestled within the deep, earthy forest, where a breeze blows its wild floral notes on the leaves, and then it's gone. [chuckles] Wow. Your turn. - [stammers awkwardly] - [chuckles] Yeah. Old cowboy legend has it that when a cowboy would head out for a long cattle drive, he'd leave lavender behind for his girl. It meant, "You have my heart," and the lavender was the only flower that could last until he came back. Will, um... Will, I have to tell you something. Um... Wait. What? What are you looking at? It can't be. What is that? It's a marker. Usually left when the land's been surveyed. But I thought nobody really knew this place existed. That's what I thought. We should get back. Yeah. Yes, I-I know it's perfect and it has the flat ground cover that we need, but... Sorry, I'm going to have to call you back. Thank you. Hey, Will, how's your day going? Are you making sure Ms. Ryan's last day is memorable? I just took her out to Lavender Grove. Oh, you did? That's certainly a special treat. Is something going on, Olivia? Because I saw a surveyor's marker out there. [sighs] I did everything I could, Will, to even hide that it was there, but the aerials of the property gave it away. To the investors? I tried everything, every other option of where to build the hotel, but they hold the purse, and this is what they want. Why didn't you tell me? I just found out yesterday, and I wanted to fix it before you knew and find a new investor, but you and I both know we may not get another opportunity, and I want this place to grow. Not in this way, but I don't know any other way... and the worst part, I don't want you to think that I don't care, because I do. I know you do, Olivia. I understand. This place is your dream. So... you do what you have to. Are you saying this may not be your dream? I'm sorry, Olivia. As much as I love it here... I don't think it is. [Will] Hey. [Katie] Hi. Can I join you? Of course. How are you? Did you find out what that marker meant? I did. It seems the investors have decided that's where they'd like the expansion of this place built. Can't Olivia talk to them, or... She's tried, but her hands are tied, and unless I stay here, and help her realize her dream, together, I really don't have a place to say. Right. So are going to stay, and cancel your hike? No. Because my heart isn't here. [cell phone rings] It's reception. Oh, sure. How's it going? I think he just told me his heart isn't with Olivia. Really? So then did you tell him about the article? - Hi. - Article? What article? [Penny] Uh... I should leave you two. Sorry. Bye. If you need to go and deal with something, that's fine. It was just a question about Rainbow Trail. What article was Penny talking about? Um... it's complicated. Okay, um... when I told you I was here to widen my horizons, that was true, but it was because I got the opportunity from my boss to write an article. It was 2,000 words. It was about this city girl who gets to go and conquer all of this, but I had to be undercover. I get it. You couldn't tell anyone in case it altered your experience. Exactly. Well, I can understand that. That's good. Um, but there's more. When my boss found out about you, she wanted to change the focus of the article. She got all caught up in this vision of a mountain man, and adventure, and romance... Wow. You did all this without me knowing. I didn't know what to do, and I... I feel terrible, and I'm so sorry. This day is like deja vu. First, Lavender Grove, and now this. But I think that I can fix it. You know, like, if you tell me what it is that you want in this article, then I can... I can go back to my boss, and I can ask her to change it. You know what, it's okay. Unless there's something else you'd like to know about me. Maybe your boss would like something more on my love life, because there really isn't anything to say about that. Good night, Katie, and I hope you've enjoyed your stay with us. ♪ ♪ Yeah.
