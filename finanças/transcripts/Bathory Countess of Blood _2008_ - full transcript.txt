Behold the castle of Čachtice. An unconquerable stronghold that time will turn into stones and dust. The last witness to the mysterious story of Hungary’s wealthiest noblewoman Countess Erzsébet Báthory. It is here that she is said to have tortured and killed innocent virgins in order to bathe in their blood and remain young and beautiful forever. The fewer the facts, the more plentiful the legends. The truth, alas, will remain buried in this forgotten dungeon from where the Countess’s desperate wailing and sobbing could be heard night after night, until the Devil himself took pity on her and, setting her on his fiery steed, carried her away to the darkest depths of hell. Or was it an Angel? And was the story quite different, perhaps? I pledge the hand of my daughter Erzsébet Báthory in marriage to Ferenc Nádasdy. So that our families may be united. Let them become the wealthiest and most powerful in Hungary! Erzsébet! Look, I’ve got my own horse! Oriás! Now I am a man! Marriage is a duty and love a sin. Ferenc will increase the family fortune. Your job is to manage and preserve it. And look after the serfs. They can’t work if they’re ill. Erzsébet! Cheers! Long live the newlyweds! My dear Countess, we have a duty to our families to conceive a son. Are we going to know how? Don’t worry, my dear. My uncle told me how. For centuries the Turks and the Tartars had been plundering the Hungarian Kingdom, killing and destroying everything that Hungarians held sacred. My Erzsébet. Finally, Protestant lords set aside their disputes with the Catholics and together rose to wage war against the Moslem hordes. The fate of a vast realm of peoples speaking thirteen languages lay in the hands of a few powerful men led by Ferenc Nádasdy. Look at the Habsburgs. Always the first to run away. I like to see the infidels giving the Catholics a good chase. I told you we would not be bored for long. For God and Hungary! Hajrá! Hajrá! For Hungary! Hajrá! Ottoman dogs! Count Nádasdy, a fearless warrior and commander, always stood in the forefront of the brave sons of Hungary. The bleeding Hungarian Kingdom became the last bastion protecting Christian Europe against the heathens. History is written by victors and chronicles by fools like me, a poor friar named Peter. My testimony is not a legend about heroes like Ferenc. It tells of the life and death of his beautiful wife Erzsébet. The three dragon teeth from her family crest are the three names that bit into her life and ultimately fulfilled her destiny. - Countess. - Thurzo? - Where’s Ferenc? - Don’t worry, he’s safe. It was a great victory. This is a list of war loot. And he has sent you a present. Look out of the window. The best present would be to have Ferenc home. He’s an Italian painter, Ferenc stole from the Turks. He was going to paint Venetian roses for the Pasha of Buda. Now, my lady, he’ll paint you. For your portrait, Ferenc has promised him freedom. - I am a protégé of Cardinal del Monte! - Move! Perhaps he’ll manage to capture your beauty. Hurry up, painter! You’re so sweet. Ferenc, my dearest husband. Hajrá! Perhaps you could stop by after Sunday service to sign your agreement with us - for the next half a year. - Do not worry, pastor. - I will sign it in Ferenc’s name. - Stop! Yes, István? Our painter has already used half the forest for his paints, and he still he wants more. - What else does he need? - Give me the paper. - What kind of rose is this? - A Venetian rose. Blue as the Venetian sky. Forgive me, we’ve spent time mourning our dead comrades. We have been living close to death. Thurzo and you got drunk, Ferenc. Tomorrow I’m conquering a fortress near the Eger. Tonight I’m conquering you! Ferenc! Ferenc! No! Ferenc! No! No! My baby! - Love cannot harm the baby! - No! Please! Dusty, down! My baby! This endless war has turned me into a brute. Even when I’m with you I behave like a barbarian. My dear Erzsébet, forgive me the pain I caused you. I’ll never forgive myself for the loss of our unborn son. God damned! Shit! That was close! Cannonballs, arrows, everything misses him! He has the luck of the Devil. God gave Nádasdy courage and strength, that’s all. Yes, Batthányi, and wealth and a beautiful wife. - You envy him? - Of course I envy him. Beautiful women are hard to find. When the masters return from the war, they become as strong as horses. They take what they want, it's better not to defend yourself. The Countess order me to whip. She saw me to enjoy. Very sweet boy. You can have me for nothing! Come on, Merisi, come and take what the masters get. Leave me alone! Get out! Open the door, Merisi! - Who is it for God’s sake? - Why is it locked? I’m mixing paints. Look at this red. It’s the colour of blood. It stands for life and for love. - This is Erika? - I was just drawing from memory. See? Tomorrow, you’ll begin painting me and my daughters. You will preserve what I have left. Poor Countess is well again. The Countess knows the herbs that would raise even our withered dicks. Shut up! It is the only thing you think of. Do you know how many children her herbs have saved! I can’t seem to capture the curves of your body. I need a naked model! A chaste woman shows her body not even her own husband. Look at this! I never paint any creature without knowing its skeleton. In Firenze, painters cut up the dead. Damn it! - What is this place? A torture chamber? - My hospital. I’ll use this to cauterize the bite. This is what I use to let blood when there are no leeches. My God! Oh stop crying or I cut off your leg. - What’s this? - My herbarium. - Oh God. - Medicinal herbs. Please don’t let me die in this horrible place! What’s this? An inventory of your victims? Subjects I have cured. - Now, hold the sinner fast, Dora! - No! - No! - Don’t worry, it’s nothing. This will teach you to paint naked women. Move, Erika! Here is the sinner, milady. No. I didn’t want it. They kicked the door open and raped us all. They were drunk, waving their sabres and shouting. There was nothing we could do! Which one attacked you? It was the officer with the scar on his forehead. Thurzo? István. Every night some man tries to get into my room. Even old István! Hold out your hand! For your protection. There is only one God. But the world stands divided by the ways each of his flocks comes unto him. Hajrá! Why are they running away all of a sudden? They got scared, Moslem cowards! What are they doing? Why aren’t they fighting? There are two harems in the camp. They are celebrating already. They don’t give a shit about your orders. The battle’s not over, you Hapsburg fuckers! Turn back and fight, lazy bastards! We should enjoy the spoils of war as well. It could be a trap! The Turks have given up too easily. They can come back. These Turkish harlots look good! Fuck the harlots, Thurzo. Cut their commander’s head off! Thurzo! Turkish swine! Fight! They won’t get out of this alive! When will you paint my face? I’m waiting to see you smile. Why do you hide what is beautiful about you? Leonardo said that the painting is a poem for the eyes. For me, this land is a poem, Merisi. Hungary stretches from Moravia all the way down to the Adriatic Sea. I own one third of the country, which is more land than the King has. Sixteen castles, thousands of serfs and twenty times as many game. - What about those deer? - They belong to Thurzo. Our nearest neighbour. Ferenc made him a gift of these lands but he always wants more. Now he wants my lakes. A charming man. But he sniffs around my maids like a dog on heat. Our Lord will avenge you, my brave soldiers! For God and Hungary! We’re lucky they have no idea who you are. For God and Hungary! - What is he saying? - That it’ll be our turn tomorrow. Hey! What’s up? A message has arrived from my uncle, the Prince of Transylvania. Bad news? My uncle Zsigmond has invited us to his birthday party. I have work for you. Wait here. It took ten years of marriage before I had my first child. It was a girl. But the one we hoped for most was little András here. I want you to paint him. But you must be quick. - We leave for Transylvania tomorrow. - I cannot do it in one night! Oh, Madonna mía! You have to make it. I want to return him to the earth where he belongs. Use both hands! Careful! We’re almost there, Ferenc. Who is there? Erika? Ma per dio! Cristo! You’ve saved my life. Oriás! I won’t forget it. Your hand. It was an honour, Commander. Friend. Count Nádasdy will be angry. I haven’t finished your painting yet. One painting you haven’t finished, the other you managed to burn. What am I to do with you? I’m going to make a gift of you for my uncle. I’m not your slave to just give away! When will you understand? Your fate is in my hands. You’re the spoils of war. Less than a slave. War loot. War loot! - Erzsébet! Good to see you! - Uncle Zsigmond. - Bethlen, my right hand. - Countess. And you recognize your nephew? Gábor. Gábor! Now that Transylvania has joined the war against the Turks, - we need young blood. - How handsome you’ve become! And you are more beautiful by the day, Aunt Erzsébet. The Báthorys have hot and wild blood running through their veins. That’s Uncle Miklós. When he was a Bishop, he killed more people than all the Turks put together. And Cardinal András Báthory, a true saint of a man. It was a shame uncle had him quartered. Great aunt Arnica Báthory. Like the Vikings, she believed that she would remain forever young and beautiful if her soul passed through fire into another body. And she got what she wanted when she burnt her castle down. And now... the Zsigmond’s most charming niece. A woman whose beauty and youth seem eternal. A woman with more wealth than all of us put together! - Brings us a delightful gift. - Move! A Milanese painter, who will paint the celebrant in a flash. Music! Prince Zsigmond, profile! Yes! Excellent! It’s just perfect! - And it is done! - No, not yet! - King of Transylvania! - Vixen! - Are you bored? - Thurzo! Where’s Ferenc? War is a priority for him as usual. Should we play chess or shall we dance? A battle or an embrace? Definitely a battle. There is no message from Ferenc? Ferenc has sent presents to your uncle and myself for your amusement. Then amuse me. The winner chooses the dance. You don’t like me, Erzsébet, do you? Countess moves the queen. I have always wanted a wife as clever as you. You are the most beautiful woman in the whole of Hungary. A clever wife can be troublesome for a husband. The knight! Watch your King. I can’t concentrate with that Italian clown watching. If I were your husband, I would have him castrated. Clown? Finish the game for me, Merisi. You can’t do that! - Checkmate, Lord Thurzo! - You...! You should spend more time practising your chess than chasing my maids. Wait, Countess! I forgot to tell you something about Ferenc. That swine Thurzo! He has ruined our celebration. - That swine saved Ferenc’s life. - Well, that’s Thurzo’s story. - But I don’t believe him! - Stay a little longer, Erzsébet. If my husband is wounded, then I must be by his side. I am so sorry. Thank you for everything. I must go to Sárvár. We’ll meet at home my little angels. Ferenc is in Pressburg now at the orders of King Rudolf. - How badly injured is he? - His shoulder wound has healed. They haven’t even bothered to tidy the room! Lazy whores! I want every maid in this castle whipped! I am lonely, Merisi. I miss tenderness. Kiss me! It’s an order. I’ve never kissed a woman. Then this shall be your first time. Paint me. You have the eyes and the smile of da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. Have you ever been in love? When I was studying to be a painter, I met a beautiful young man, called Luca. He became my model. It was passion for his physical perfection, it wasn’t love. You must keep this only in your mind. You have the same birthmark as your aunt Arnica. - Are you afraid of growing old? - It is the law of God. - Everything must grow old. - Except for faces in paintings. A painting can preserve what time destroys. People will admire your pale beauty long after you leave this world. There’s something wrong with my blood. That’s why I’m so pale. Sometimes I hear a roaring inside my head. As though the sea were calling to me. I feel death in my bones. Nobody must know! Not even Ferenc. Do you love your husband? Marriage is not about love. Catch him! - Ficzko! What is it? - Man spying but ran away. Hurry, run! When you were gone a vampire was raging here. Those are not teeth marks. Take the body to the castle! - Oh my God! - This is my gift to you. You wished to paint like the masters in Firenze. I can’t do it. You said you wanted to understand the human body. It feels like murder. OK! Let’s murder together. I am scared, Merisi, the Countess is a vampire. If we don’t run away, she will kill us and drink our blood. Come with me! God, I’ll never lie again. How it is when a man loves a man? - The same as when he loves a woman. - Stop! Get out! Come on, Merisi! I want to see if you are at all a man. Capisco, Contessa. - I understand, I’m a handsome man, no? - Go! No, no... - No! - Go! Come back! Wait! Countess! I swear I will only make love to women from now on! Did you know that your behind is prettier than your face? You were running away because of István? Every night that pig tried to get into my room. - So you killed him? - I didn’t kill him. Don’t you dare lie to me! I saw the wounds. From the dagger I gave you to protect yourself. Hold out your hands! Both! Where did you get this ring? Where did you get this ring? Where did you steal it? - Where? - Merisi gave it to me! - Liar! - I’m not lying! He’s obsessed with me! We fornicate every night! He begged me to run away with him! Stop, Erika! No! God, forgive me. Please! I didn’t mean this to happen. Oh God. Ficzko! Leave me alone! Get out! Out! Everyone! I haven’t seen you for five days! Why are you avoiding me? - You have betrayed me. - No! I could never betray you. I love you! You’re a liar! Please, wait! - Wait! - You’re a liar! You’re right! I have lied to you. - I’m not who you think I am. - Go! I am not as innocent as I appear. A year ago I killed a man in a duel. That is why I had to run from my home. The Turks captured me on my way to Vienna. Then your husband. Merisi is my real name. But I sign my paintings Caravaggio. Caravaggio? I used to think that the only thing that mattered to me was painting. But now... the one thing I cannot live without... is you. Quick! Go to your room! Ferenc is back. Quick! - I’m not going anywhere. - Ficzko! Ferenc will not believe in our innocence. He won’t give you freedom. - Ficzko! - Yeah. Where’s my wife? She hasn’t come out of her bedchamber for three days. Three days? Is she sick? My God! Since when does husband enter his wife’s chamber through the window? Since he cannot live without her. - Are you ill? - I have been so lonely, Ferenc. Archduke Matthias, brother to King Rudolf, has honoured us with his visit. He can wait. Why are you crying? Come. Did my painter do that? I want you to send him away. Send him away, Ferenc. Please! I don’t want to see him anymore. Archduke Matthias has a good time. You should be more at his side. Hurry slowly, my throne will wait for me. That’s my philosophy. How does she behave? I don’t know her like that. She’s enjoying herself. There’s nothing sinful about that, is there? That Italian prick is wearing her ring! How did he get it? Did I tell you he went with her on her visit to Transylvania? They spent a night in Sárvár on the way home. Oh my God! I’ll kill him! Wait! In front of the King’s brother? I don’t care! He wants freedom. Why not give it to him? Come here, painter! I have a reward for you. Drink! You’ll be a free man again. To your freedom, painter! To freedom! Freedom! Erzsébet! Don’t touch her! Get out! Water! Now! Send for some healer! Did you hear what I said? They’re witches! I don’t care if they’re the Devil incarnate. I have to save my wife! Open your eyes. Emerge from the darkness. Come into the light. Welcome back to the world, Countess. Who is she? A healer and fortune teller. Darvulia. Caravaggio? Where is he? The Count had him walled in a week ago. Drink this. Merisi? The rats have eaten his bones? No. He’s alive. Do you feel it? A draught. He escaped. He didn’t wait to see if I lived. I know why you hear the roaring of the sea. You are ill. And I’ll cure you. I know the secret of healthy blood. And what’s more, my medicine will keep you as young and beautiful as you are in the painting. But you will have to make a sacrifice. Love. And reputation. You will bear Ferenc’s son and for ten years you will live a happy and full life. And then? See for yourself. I will show you evil that you can’t avoid without my help. A time will come when you must choose for yourself. Who is this man? Your enemy. He’s paving your way to hell. Before I die I will write his name on the wall. In my own blood. There is only one God. Yet, men keep dying in this war against the Moslems. But neither were the Christians at peace with one another. When the Grim Reaper increased his toll off the battlefield, His Eminence Cardinal Forgach sent me on a secret mission to Upper Hungary. Rumours from Čachtice spread throughout the kingdom that its wealthiest noblewoman was under the spell of an old seer named Darvulia and her black magic with blood. Assisted by a young novice named Cyril, I was to find out whether it was true that this stronghold of Protestant belief had become a focus of evil powers. Father Peter, let’s go back! Leave them alone! - Water! - Yes. We must save the inn so we have place where to stay. I can’t believe it. Our own soldiers kidnapping our peasants - and selling them to the Turks as slaves. - Lift me up, Mummy. Robbers! I want to see! We’ll be safe. They won’t dare attack the castle. Why are you postponing our wedding, mother? We’ve been through this many times, Anna. I’m glad Lord Zrinyi’s family will be joining ours but not in this time of war. Thank you. Why you always do what that old hag wants you to? She saved me from death. Darvulia found the cure for my illness. Now that is enough. You’re nothing but a laughing stock! Even if you conspire with the Devil, you won’t stay young forever! Sara! Sara, stop! You’re good with your hands. I used to be a woodcutter before I was a monk. And what about you? When are you going to get married, Lucia? When she’s saved for a good dowry. She’s going into service. - In the castle. - In the castle? Let’s go! This one doesn't marry. - Get to work! - Yes, mother. Christian brethren. I am Father Peter. - This is Cyril, a novice. - My name is Ponický. I’m the new pastor. What brings you here? The Church is making a map of Upper Hungary. You’ll find this is a strange place. Ever since the old hag bewitched Countess Erzsébet, castle maids have been dying one after another. - Is it the plague? - The plague. God save you. God save you! Where the devil can’t go, he sends a Catholic. Out of the way! Another body! We have to send the message to the monastery. The first body. Father, let us hope that next time it is not yours. Careful, father, the spies' eyes are gouged out here. I have two eyes, losing one is worthy of what I see here. Write. The old witch Darvulia buries bodies in the unconsecrated land near the castle. Period. The cause of death not yet determined. - The plague. - The plague with a blade? The Cardinal was right in sending us here. Death and blood surround me. Another of the maids is now gone. It wasn’t a plague but an accident. I’m worried about you, dear Ferenc. Our daughters seem quite eager to marry, soon I will be even more alone. I just praise the Lord that Pál is still too young and that I have my faithful Darvulia by my side. Think of the one you long for. Her potions are a miracle. We pray together calling on the Lord to help you return safely home to us, my dearest Black Bey. This war has been going on for more than ten years now. Only God Almighty will know when it will end. I’m looking forward to Pál growing old enough to end this disaster. Praise be to God that all of you are well and safe. Your Black Bey. Ferenc. For Hungary! Hajrá! For victory! Thurzo! Brother! Watch my back! Black Bey! Save yourselves! Hide the gold! Where’s the gold? Give it to me! For Hungary! What is it? Death... - ...is on the prowl. - My blood. It’s turned black! Go to the Countess, Lucia. Tell her to get ready for a journey to Sárvár. Ferenc! Ferenc! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Ferenc! Ferenc, you’ve frightened us. When I grow up, father, - I’ll to be like you. - If I live to see spring I’ll make you White Bey. Now go. Erzsébet. Yes? Be careful! The Hapsburgs are trying to tear Hungary apart. There will be traitors when the time comes. Protect yourself! Join forces with Batthányi. Why? Because I trust him. Marry Pál into their family. Or get married yourself. Our swords will protect us. Hajrá! Come hither, ye noble lords of this proud land. Part with your peer who so bravely took the stand. He awed the Turks as the feared Black Bey. Battling for Christ till his dying day. His ear is frostbitten. Who knows what the two witches did to him. Message. Cardinal Forgach! Your Eminence, funeral report. Go. Thank you. Erzsébet, we need to talk. I know this is not good time for you, but when I helped Ferenc to escape, he promised to leave me the Lakeland. I want to be sure there won’t be any unpleasantness about this. There is no mention of this in his will. I hope you’re not intending to countermand the word of your husband. Please, Thurzo. I’m only claiming what’s mine. Find another widow to swindle. Don’t think you can fool me like you fooled Ferenc. He never knew, like I did what happened in Sárvár. How often that queer Italian painter had you on your hands and knees - while he was protecting our country? - How dare you!? How dare you? I’ll take that as a little piece of foreplay. You Bastard! You dirty scheming piece of scum! Out, you swine! Run to your friends, the Hapsburgs! She’ll soon give me what’s mine. Don’t worry, I’ll protect you, Aunt Erzsébet. When I become Prince of Transylvania, I’ll be able to crush anyone, even the King. Sir, we have to go. Oh, yes. Here is a letter for you. Thank you, Gábor. Caravaggio. He’s alive. Madam! Let’s go! May I come in, my lord? I can see thinking of her riches strips you of your sleep. She started a game she can’t win. She must give you what’s yours, the bitch! Let me join this game with you. I’ll make myself very useful. I can turn Darvulia. You’re more useful giving birth to my children, my dear. And don’t forget, I know poisons which can turn even the Pope’s soul black. Don’t play with fire! You could lose your head. Don’t worry, no one will suspect you. We found her on the road near the manor house. Some kind of beast beheaded her. And your family crest is carved on her chest. - Are any of your household missing? - Not that I know of, Ponický. Darvulia? Done for today. I want to sin. I want to be consumed by the fiery flames of fornication. I want to be consumed by you. Arnica? I’m Erzsébet. You are Arnica. I don’t want to die in flames like you! You will not feel pain or sinful passion. You should not travel alone, it’s not safe. - Especially during the war. - I have all the protection I need. I’m representing the King’s interests here. - I hope you don’t intend to assault me. - You are lucky. I haven’t the strength for it. Rumours of your healer have reached the court. She’s hurting your reputation. Get rid of her! Darvulia is not your concern. Erzsébet, you should think of Pál’s future. If we both join forces with the Hapsburgs, they’ll win the war and we’ll become fabulously wealthy. The Báthory family will never convert to Catholicism. I’m a Protestant just like you. Why convert? Think about it. If we achieve peace between the Hapsburgs and the Hungarian nobility, - your son could become Emperor. - Is that one of Matthias’s interests? This is what I want. And I want you. What are you doing? - Ferenc would have killed you. - Ferenc is dead. Then I will kill you, you bastard! I’m sorry, milady! My hand slipped. You wanted to kill me. No, you know, milady, I would give my life for you! I know, Sara. I know. I cannot tell dream from reality. I’m so tired I want to die. You can’t leave this world, my dear. The children need you. Especially little Pál. Pál? Yes, your son. I have a son? I don’t understand. The medicine that use to help you, is now working against you. Oh God, another one! Reeve! - Did you notice the coat of arms? - Three dragon’s teeth. Countess’s said to keep virgins’ blood in her wine kegs. Sooner or later, all our blood will be in there. For if you are not to be saved by good works it is a sure and certain thing that you will be damned by evil ones! The Jezebel is still among us! Secreted within her castle walls. Bathing in the blood of innocent virgins! Leave! The truth will follow you! A miracle! God has confirmed my words. - The mail’s arrived! - Yeah. - Hurry up! - Thank you, mother. You'll help me in the kitchen. Margita! Hurry up! Come on, Cyril, read it! Send a proof that Countess is bathing in blood of virgins to be young forever. Cardinal sends us to the castle. Don’t you think it’s strange, she looks twenty years younger than she really is? Father Peter, you really hate her. Protestant Countess is capable of anything. Why isn’t Sara doing my hair? Don’t you remember? Really? What are you drinking all the time? Your potion. Oh God! Black mushrooms! Don’t eat or drink anything I haven’t prepared for you myself! Do you understand me? Take this one. No! I don’t want any more raw liver! - You need it to heal your blood. - Blood! Blood! I want Sara! Where is Sara? Sara is dead. - You killed Sara! - Come, I’ll help you. - Together we can do it. - You killed Sara! - She wanted to poison your soul. - No! Look what these mushrooms made of you! - A murderess! - No! No! I didn’t kill her. You! You’ve been deceiving me for all these years! Ficzko? Ficzko! - Yes, milady. - You take this witch and you chain her to the wall! I’m not your enemy. I would never hurt you. Take your green poison with you! God forgive you, Erzsébet. Quick, father! It works! We are right on time. We’ll be conspicuous in the cassocks. And attackable without them. Monks are welcome everywhere. Go! Lucia, wait for me! Come on! We’ve got to find those kegs of blood. Father Peter! Ponický was right. She’s bathing in blood. Get the apparatus ready! Hurry! What a beautiful picture! Yes. What are you looking at? Give me a coal and a parchment. We’ll have the proof. Spies! We were just looking. What are you? Spies? - Thieves? - We are land surveyors. We are mapping the settlements of Upper Hungary. You’re trespassing on my land. I’ll have you whipped and eyes gouged out. We are under the protection of Cardinal Forgach. Not even the Pope will protect you here, monk. On your knees! Cyril was your serf. Cyril? The boy I healed. You were attacked by wolves. Yes, it’s me. You put me together again and sent me to school. Thank you, milady, I will pray for you. You became a Catholic. Why did you renounce the faith of your forefathers? - I’ve wanted to be a land surveyor. - Mummy! - We’ve found a dead body! - A body? It is Sara. She was buried in the churchyard. - Somebody dug her up. - How did her body get here? We were on guard all night. Nothing went past. Poor girl. A vampire attacked her and sucked her blood out. This is his sign. Her soul will never find peace. This was no vampire. They are trying to trick us. Do you see the bath? Go! Bring Darvulia here. She’s gone! The chain is missing. - Where is she? - She’s gone, the witch! She was chained to the rock! Somebody helped her. The chain has been cut. Have these two spies whipped out of the castle. We are Christians! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No! Thank you! Thank you, Lord, for saving us from the clutches of the blood-beast! One exhumed maid doesn’t make her a murderer or a vampire. - What about the blood in the bath? - Water. - Just red herbs. - Red water. Look. Herbs. Siding with your beloved Countess again. You Lutheran. I believe she’s innocent. You mustn’t believe, you must see! We’re surveyors. She doesn’t bathe in blood! The more plentiful the legends, the fewer the facts. Everything I had believed in ceased to make sense. There were no vampires or bathing in blood. What troubled me was the disappearance of the witch Darvulia. It became a challenge for me, Cardinal Forgach’s spy, to discover who was behind these strange events. Thurzo? Welcome to the first Hungarian library opening! - How could I refuse to come? - You’re nice. Countess has brought you a dancing partner, girls. - Countess is here. - Take Pál to the garden. - Are you well? - Very well, thank you. We have learned tomes in five languages. But I have another book, which I think will interest you more. Aren’t you missing a king? - Everyone is missing something. - My herbarium. - How did you get it? - You draw beautifully. But you realize, if the church ever discovered this, you would be burned at the stake. We have right to punish our serfs, this is the privilege of the nobility. But in the long run it will harm you, Erzsébet. As will the story about stabbing the maid to death with a pair of scissors. How do you know this? Darvulia? The old witch thought that you and Thurzo were enemies. She came crawling here to give him your herbarium. How could you? She can’t answer you anymore. She doesn’t have her tongue. But she still has the black soul. Take her back and treat her as a traitor. I told you to rid yourself of that witch. Imagine if she had gone to someone who wished to harm you. - Who wants to harm me? - The Hapsburgs for instance. They want Hungary to be Catholic. And you, the most powerful protestant in the realm, are standing in their way. I hear you’re about to become the Palatine. I can protect you. In the country where men rule by swords even a powerful widow can lose everything. As I said, I will take care of myself. Mama, the girls are going to Vienna to see King Matthias! - Can we go too? - Please! - Please, mama. - You can’t miss the royal ball. Monteverdi is putting on what he calls an opera. And the painter Caravaggio is exhibiting a large painting in the cathedral. Caravaggio? We are such stuff as dreams are made on. He who yearns for power and wealth would even sell his soul to hell. This was my bitter truth. You still have the eyes and the smile of the Mona Lisa. Merisi! You’d rather watch Signor Monteverdi’s work in progress than see my completed masterpiece? I should’ve painted you. You’re far more beautiful than my Madonna. - And older. - Paintings capture youth for eternity. - I must see your birthmark again. - Not here! It’s a sin! At least we don’t have to go far to confess. You once gave me a ring. I had to sell it to get back home. Here’s one for you. May it bring you luck. Blue like the Venetian rose. I’m offering you my friendship forever. King Matthias wants to see you. You’re beautiful. It’s nice to see you enjoying yourself. I’m glad you took up our suggestion of coming to Vienna. She’s not as clever as you thought. God, have mercy on her! Let her remember my prophecy. Now that she’s passed beyond my protection, let her come under yours. Don’t leave her. Your Majesty. Countess Báthory whose unfading beauty has become legend. - Dear, I wish to know your secret. - What secret? The secret of your eternal youthfulness. If you let the King into your secret, he will let you see into the future. My fortune-teller is blind but she can see the future clearly. You will not be pleased. You’re on a journey and you’re travelling faster and faster. You are hurtling towards the flames. You’ve conspired with the Devil. Your end is surely near. You must take it with a pinch of salt, Countess. You’re the one paving my way to hell. On the contrary, I’m here to guarantee your safety. And yet, you reject me. You’ll see what will happen to you without my protection. - I’ll seek protection from the King. - I only want what Ferenc promised me. Now I want a third of your property or the Gypsy’s prophecy will come true before tomorrow. Oh my God! Not even you would go that far! We could have left the King out of it. If you weren’t so stubborn. This was my last offer. No matter what you do, you’ll never see me on my knees. You’ll see! Perhaps not today but definitely tomorrow. - Soon I’ll be second only to the King. - Bastard! One word and everything can be different. Some day you’ll realise I’m better than your Ferenc was. As you wish, Erzsébet. Cut the maids bellies open so the Countess can have a nice warm bloody bath. When you’ve finished, leave by the back door. Come on, break the door in! Go quick! So, where is the Countess? Since when does a captain enter my chamber without permission? Darvulia! Darvulia. Darvulia. No! No! Forgive me, Darvulia, I will never forget you. From now on, profits from our land will go to my nephew Gábor in Transylvania. Are you sure about this? Gábor is only a distant relative. Gábor is the only one I trust and the only one whose army the King fears. You’re making decisions about money that will eventually be ours. There will be only one heir to the family estate. That is Pál. You will need his protection and he will only be able to give this if he’s strong. And what about the two of us? We married your daughters. What do we get? You will get his protection too. Vivat Palatine! You are a powerful Palatine now. You are the law. I’ll get her next time. Swear that you’re doing this for us and not for her. Get out! Get out! Don’t sleep, Erzsébet! Wake up! Wake up! Rise up! Why can’t you find peace in your grave, Darvulia? Alarm! Alarm! Leave it! Poison! Pál! My son. He tried to kill my son! Thurzo’s assassins. The third one got away! Throw their heads on Thurzo’s doorstep! If he wants to play, we’ll play. Hurry! Thurzo will know this was us and not the Turks, Aunt Erzsébet. That’s what I wanted. He may threaten you. If you need anything, just send a message to me and I’ll bring my entire army. Thank you, Gábor. I have bad news. Your friend, the Italian painter, is dead. - Caravaggio? - God rest his soul. He died of a fever, alone. I had no chance... to say goodbye. A painting can preserve what time destroys. Nothing lasts, Merisi. Not even faces in paintings. Why are all the people I loved leaving me? This is a warning. That Transylvanian swine, Gábor, has burnt your third village. He’s ready to declare war on the King just to protect his aunt. We must bring the bitch to court immediately. We can’t get the Countess to court unless we get six nobles to testify against her. - Why don’t we lay siege to her castle? - It will take months, maybe years. No! The only way to nail her is to catch her in flagrante delicto. In the act of murder! And to arrange witnesses to her abominations. Stop! Father Peter, look! Sometimes you can’t even believe your eyes. The devil is back. I must inform the Palatine. In this letter Pastor Ponický is asking the King and me, in my new role as Palatine, to call a halt to Countess’s murders. As a member of the nobility she is entitled to put her serfs to death. - We’re talking about dozens of murders. - The pastor letter claims, she transforms herself into a black cat! We can make a charge of a witchcraft stick. That won’t work! If she gets burnt as a witch, the Church will confiscate her property. And we’re seeking to further the King’s interests. Are we not? You are very angry when you fight. That’s not such a good thing. Anger is my best weapon, Batthanyi. A message from Čachtice, milady. Since my war is not over, I must return to Čachtice. Thurzo is making his next move. I promised Ferenc I protect you. Čachtice castle is impregnable! It protected me from the Turks, it will protect me from Thurzo. I’ve made up my mind. I’m going. Someone can see us! Margita! You’re kissing a Catholic? - Go and wash your mouth out! - He wants to marry me! - He’ll convert back to our faith for me! - Not only papist but turncoat too! Go! Get your hands off her or you’ll lose more than an ear! Come on, Margita! We’re no longer welcomed here. I’m not going back to the monastery. I’m fed up with being a spy! They will send other spies. Listen. Divine music. We haven’t yet managed to remove Gábor. But the Báthory case is going well. A number of witnesses have signed statements testifying to her crimes. If you manage to achieve this I’ll give you a fat salary for life. - Who is this? - Count Druget. Katalin’s husband. He’s part of the family. I can no longer keep the crimes of Countess Báthory secret. And if she’s arrested, her property will be confiscated by the Crown. But you said it would be divided between all of us. There is a solution. It’s unpleasant but if you are both completely loyal, it will work. You can count on us. In which case her property will goes neither to the King nor to the Church. It will stay within the family, that’s you. And it will be divided equally between you and your protector. - That’s me. - But what if she’s innocent? Now... I want both of you to swear agreement to this plan. Your father protected Hungary with this sword. And before that... his father and his grandfather. Oriás! Hajrá! Hajrá! Uncle Gábor will teach you how to use this. And then you’ll be our protector. The blood of our family. Whatever happens, you remember who you are and where you belong. I promise. Excuse me for arriving unannounced. Anna and I were making plans for Christmas and we thought it appropriate we’d spend the holidays together - as a family. - I’m sorry. - Druget and Katalin agree... - No, Miklós. I already promised Pál we would spend New Year in Transylvania with the family. We must leave before Christmas. But your daughters were so looking forward to your company. - Stay at least for Christmas. - I’d really want to see my sisters, mama. Let’s stay here. A few days won’t make any difference. Go! There must be a traitor amongst your servants. How else would Thurzo know about you getting ready to leave? He’s up to something. They have stationed the Royal Guard patrols around Čachtice. The town has been sealed off. Catch him! Lucia! - Your safety’s at stake, Countess! - Do not worry, Gábor will protect me. I’ll send him a message immediately to come after Christmas with his army. Until then, I will celebrate the birth of our Lord here at the Castle with my family. I promised it to Pál. For your services. - Remember me in your prayers. - Thank you. That pigeon has a message! It’s from the castle! Shoot it down! Quick! Ficzko, this will warm you up. That was wonderful! Give the children their treats. Start packing, we go to the castle. Lucia, come with me. Hurry! It’s a pity I’m not going with you, milady. Especially now, I’ve learned to open my veins all by myself. I know you mean well, but I need nothing more than herbs. I can’t even look at blood anymore. Dorota, what you’re doing here? I forgot to close the window. Be gone! This is your Christmas present from me. Take all the herbs to the castle and help with dinner. Ficzko will take you home. Freedom for me and my family? I don’t deserve this. Yes, you do, Lucia. You are like my own child. May I kiss you good-bye? - Cyril. - It’s nearly dark. I’m worried Lucia’s not home yet. Please meet her. - Ficzko! - What? You are supposed to take me home. Milady has set me free! - Where have you been? - Don’t take another step! Who are you? Did you hear? Someone is calling for help. - Wasn’t that Lucia? - Lucia? - Why would she be in the church? - I don’t know. It must have been somebody. Someone’s definitely here. See the light? Where does this lead? - Shit! - Cyril! God hears you. Don’t get your feet wet, Father! Soldiers! What is the royal guard doing in here? Ficzko is the traitor. It looks like a secret passage. Open the gate! It’s me, Zrinyi. Master Zrinyi. The Countess is expecting you. Father! - Poor girls. - We must help them. - Go hide to the belfry. Go! - Hurry! - Go! - This way! No! No! Leave me alone! Where are the girls? They’ve escaped! You didn’t tie them up properly. - Ficzko! - It’s you, you scum! Tear! Come, Lucia! Who are you? Dora? Don’t kill me, Ficzko! King’s soldiers! I must warn Countess. Thurzo! The Judas! God, give me something to my hand to kill him. Shit! Palatine Thurzo! Out of the way! Quickly, we have to hide. I wasn’t expecting so many guests. Happy Christmas Eve. Happy Christmas Eve to you. I’ve heard a rumour that you are leaving. I couldn’t let you go without saying good bye. Enough of this. Erzsébet Báthory, I arrest you in the name of the King for imprisoning, torturing and killing young girls in the dungeons of your castle. You cannot arrest a noblewoman without witnesses od equal rank. - You’re breaking the law. - The law in this case doesn’t apply because I’ve caught you red-handed. Take her into the dungeons! And find her son! You’re a traitor! Swine! Stop! Untie her! Where are the girls? - Where are they? - They ran away. We did everything as you told us, my lord! - What are you talking about? - I swear. You stupid whore! The monks from the inn released them. - Find them! - Go! They are herbs. In the eyes of most people it’s solid proof. People like legends more than truth. Just one word and everything can be different. Is it going to be stalemate or checkmate? Checkmate! One move! One move and I’ll send you straight to hell where you belong. - Drop your weapons! - Do what she says! Ilona, Katalin, put the soldiers behind bars! Drop your weapons! Move, guys! Do it! Drop your weapons! Open the gate! Do it! Get Pál, Ficzko! - He’s in the secret chamber. - Yes, milady. Put down your weapons! This is an order from Palatin Thurzo! Put down your weapons! - Sit! - Open the gate! Open the gate! Let the countess leave! Put down your weapons! Countess! Traitor! Shut the gate! Free the Palatine! Shut the gate! Mama! Let him be! You beast! - Pál! - Mama, I won’t let them take you! You obey the soldiers or they’ll hurt you. Yes, mummy, and I’ll wait for you. I’ll always be yours and you’ll always be mine. I love you. Pál! Pál! - I love you! - Pál! - I love you! - No! Remember! I’ll always be yours and you’ll always be mine! We’ve found chests full of jewels. Make an inventory and load it into my sleigh. Palatine Thurzo has discovered further evidence. These mutilated bodies of girls found buried in the garden of the manor house. And you were those who mocked me for comparing this heartless beast to a bloodthirsty vampire! Come to the table and sign a statement about what you’ve seen! You! You! And you! Chest number two. One gold necklace. Seven diamonds. An emerald the size of a coin. - Ruby necklace... - Ruby necklace. - ...fixed at the back. - Fixed at the back. - Four diamonds... - Four diamonds. This is... my last dispatch to you, Cardinal. Hajrá! Good God, how diabolically beautiful that Thou gavest angels their wings. Would that Thou hadst given us mortals wings, so we might soar high and see how petty and pitiable we are. - Hey, why have we stopped? - The horses fear the wolves. Catch the whore! Stop, bitch! You idiot! We needed her alive. You’ll pay for this with your head! Dorottya Szemtés, did the Countess keep records of her victims? Yes. - She wrote their names in a herbarium. - How many were they? Shut up! Whores, shut up! Thirty! Only thirty? - Thirty a month! - We want to hear everything. Even if you should make it up. Cyril, we must part now. God bless you. Goodbye, Father. As His Majesty’s Prosecutor I demand the severest punishment for these accomplices who participated in heinous crimes. The court will now pass sentence. János Ujváry, nicknamed Ficzko, will be beheaded. Ilona Jó, Katalin Beniczka and Dorottya Szemtés shall be taken to a place close to this court. Katalin Beniczka is pardoned. Other women will have all their fingers chopped off. Countess Erzsébet Báthory is sentenced to a life in jail, in isolation from the world. A red gallows will be erected at the Čachtice Castle as a symbol of her slow death. Swine! God, thank you! I’m innocent! You have imprisoned Countess Báthory in her Castle against my will. I have statements of hundreds of witnesses. Yes, but they’re all commoners! Their evidence won’t be admissible in court. Are you telling me the political wind shifted? Nobles cannot stand above the law. I, Matthias the Second, will not allow the imprisonment of a noblewoman without substantial proof of guilt. Countess Báthory was sentenced in her absence. She was not summoned and could not defend herself. All the genuine witnesses have been executed with a speed I can only describe as suspicious. There will be new court hearing. If you cannot show that you have been acting in good faith, God have mercy on you. There mustn’t be a court hearing, Cardinal. The case has turned against you. You may have executed her witnesses, but Erzsébet Báthory cannot be imprisoned in her castle forever. Unless... Unless what? Unless, my son, you felt Mother Church could benefit from a share in the property you removed from her castle. Please. For example nine chests of treasure, a necklace with... Alright. I like to win. But... I can be a good loser, too. The one thing I require in exchange is the names of the monks. I’m sorry, they’re both dead. Oh Lord, who else can make that straight which Thou had made crooked? Whose fault is that cruelty rules and justice is reserved only for the most powerful? Excuse me, Countess, a mendicant friar would like you to see him. Your Grace. Peter. No, don’t look at me like that. I know. I’ve aged. What is happening outside? In here I have no news. Thurzo is playing it both ways. But he has only one goal. To dispossess your family. Why isn’t Gábor doing something to help? Gábor is dead. He was killed by his own people. Thurzo is probably behind that. I only have bad news. I’m afraid to ask of my Pál. Zrinyi is now his guardian. He’s under pressure to renounce you. If he does before you die Thurzo and Zrinyi get everything. My son would never renounce me. Give him my will. He will need it. You must not let Thurzo win. If I still believed that God is almighty, I would pray for you. All I have left is faith. I’m not as strong as I thought. Remember me when I’m gone. Oh Lord, the weight of the cross you’ve laid on me is more than I can bear. Please, take me. Erzsébet Báthory will be given a dignified Christian funeral. She begged the Devil for death. She was heard singing hymn, God heard her. She killed others and she killed herself! She cannot be buried in sanctified soil. You small parish busybody! Who gave you the right to judge? She made the bravest move of all. The move I wasn’t expecting. The move which won the game. I loved her.
