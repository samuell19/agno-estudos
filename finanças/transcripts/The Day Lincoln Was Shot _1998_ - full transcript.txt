[ Actors In Play Talking ] [ Woman ] I AM AWARE, MR. TRENCHARD, YOU ARE NOT USED TO THE MANNERS OF GOOD SOCIETY, AND THAT ALONE WILL EXCUSE THE IMPERTINENCE OF WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN GUILTY. [ Trenchard ] DON'T KNOW THE MANNERS OF GOOD SOCIETY, HUH ? WELL, I GUESS I KNOW ENOUGH TO TURN YOU INSIDE OUT, OLD GAL. YOU SOCKDOLOGIZING OLD MANTRAP. [ Audience Laughing ] [ Gun Firing ] [ Crowd Screaming ] [ Woman Shrieks ] [ Man ] THEY SHOT THE PRESIDENT ! [ Man #1 ] STOP THAT MAN ! [ Man #2 ] STOP HIM ! [ Man #3 ] THE SOUTH IS AVENGED ! [ Man ] SMOKE HIM OUT. SMOKE HIM OUT. HE'S TRAPPED. WE NEED HIM ALIVE ! [ Man ] BOOTH! THROW OUT YOUR GUN AND COME OUT! DRAW UP YOUR MEN BEFORE THE DOOR, AND I'LL COME OUT AND FIGHT THE WHOLE COMMAND ! YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY ! YOU'RE SURROUNDED ! WELL, OKAY, BOYS. PREPARE A STRETCHER FOR ME. [ Chattering ] FOR GOD SAKES, BURKE. HOW MUCH LONGER ? I'M READY, MR. BOOTH. READY. JUST ONE MOMENT. I'VE NEVER HAD ONE OF THESE TAKE SO LONG. I WAS A YOUNG MAN WHEN I CAME IN HERE. YOU SURE YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE ? OH, I'VE PHOTOGRAPHED YOUR FATHER, JUNIUS, MR. BOOTH. GREATEST ACTOR I EVER SET EYES ON. THAT WILL WORK WONDERS FOR MY EXPRESSION. THANK YOU. ASIDE FROM YOU, OF COURSE, MR. BOOTH. OF COURSE. I MUST BE SEEING THINGS. THAT CAN'T BE MR. PAINE, HAVING JUST SET FOOT INSIDE OF A THEATER. I WOULD EXPECT YOU TO HAVE SOME SORT OF ALLERGIC REACTION BY NOW. EVERYBODY'S WAITIN' FOR YOU, CAP. WELL, WAITING SEEMS TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY. BURKE, I BEG OF YOU. I'M AGIN' BEFORE YOUR VERY EYES. ANY LONGER, I'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO PLAY CHARACTER PARTS. I APOLOGIZE. BUT I CANNOT RUSH WHEN IT COMES TO SUCH A DISTINGUISHED SUBJECT. DID YOU KNOW, SIR, THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO IS PHOTOGRAPHED MORE THAN YOU ? LET ME GUESS. GOT IT, MR. PRESIDENT. PLEASE, MR. PRESIDENT, JUST ONE MORE. I WOULD THINK THAT GLASS HAD HAD ENOUGH OF THIS FACE. NOT YET, ANYWAY. I WILL BE QUICK. HEY, PA ! [ Grunts ] THAT'S MY BOY. LIGHT AS A FEATHER. LOOK WHAT I FOUND. EXCELLENT. WHY CAN'T MY GENERALS CAPTURE THEM SO EASILY ? A COMMISSION FOR YOUNG TAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ALMOST READY, MR. PRESIDENT. [Photographer] AH! OH! HELLO, TAD. [ Booth ] WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS PROPERTY. SLAVES ARE PROPERTY. VALUABLE. WELL TAKEN CARE OF. A GENTLEMAN TREATS HIS SLAVES THE WAY HE WOULD HIS FINEST TOOLS: WITH CARE AND CONCERN. IT'S IN HIS OWN BEST INTEREST TO DO SO. NOW THIS DICTATOR DECLARES THEY ARE FREE. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE FREE MEN? FREE TO WHAT? FREE TO GO WHERE? WHAT ARE THEY TRAINED FOR? IT'S INSANITY. I MEAN, DOES THIS MAN TRULY BELIEVE... THAT HE CAN OBLITERATE A WAY OF LIFE THAT IS CENTURIES OLD? PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED, JOHN. PRETTY SPEECH, BUT I DON'T SEE YOU DOIN' MUCH ABOUT IT. I BEG YOUR PARDON ? FANCY ACTOR. PRETTY BOY LIKE YOU. OH, YOU TALK TOUGH, BUT ALL YOU DO IS PUT PAINT ON YOUR FACE AND PLAY MAKE-BELIEVE, WHILE REAL MEN ARE FIGHTIN' AND DYIN' FOR YOUR COUNTRY. ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE AN AGENT FOR OUR COUNTRY, THIS HERE'S A SAFE HOUSE, BUT YOU ARE TALKIN'... ABOUT A MAN WHO HAS RISKED HIS LIFE FOR THE SOUTH ALONG WITH THE BEST OF THEM. HE HAS SMUGGLED MEDICINE AND SUPPLIES ACROSS THE POTOMAC FOR OUR TROOPS, HE HAS GIVEN INFORMATION TO OUR FRIENDS IN RICHMOND-- LOUIS ! SO YOU MIND YOUR TONGUE, OR I WILL SURELY RIP IT FROM YOUR MOUTH. LOUIS, THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU WANT ME TO CUT HIM, JOHNNY ? THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, DAVID, BUT NO. AFTER ALL, HIS HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, EVEN IF HIS BRAIN IS NOT. MRS. SURRATT, PUT THIS MAN'S BILL ON MY ACCOUNT. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY AND ANOTHER FINE MEAL. EXCUSE THIS... UNFORTUNATE DISTURBANCE. GENTLEMEN, SHALL WE ADJOURN? OUR FRIENDS IN RICHMOND PUT IT IN MY HANDS. IT WAS GOING TO BE A MILITARY OPERATION, BUT THEY'RE TOO BUSY FIGHTING &quot;USELESS&quot; S. GRANT. I ASSURED THEM I COULD ASSEMBLE THE BEST MEN... IN THE CONFEDERACY TO ACCOMPLISH IT. I HAVE. I MEAN, THESE WALLS HAVE NEVER SEEN A FINER GROUP OF PATRIOTS. YOU KNOW HE'LL BE THERE? A MATINEE AT CAMPBELL HOSPITAL. STILL WATERS RUN DEEP. SOME FRIENDS OF MINE ARE IN IT. THEY WERE TOLD THEY WOULD BE PERFORMING FOR THE PRESIDENT. LIGHTLY GUARDED, AS ALWAYS. INTERCEPT HIM ON THE WAY? ON THE WAY BACK. TAKE HIM THROUGH SOUTHERN MARYLAND. AND NO ONE KNOWS THOSE BACK ROADS BETTER THAN YOU, DAVEY. MR. LLOYD WILL HAVE SUPPLIES WAITING FOR US AT THE TAVERN IN SURRATTSVILLE, AND I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO OUR PEOPLE THERE. MR. ATZERODT... WILL HAVE A BOAT WAITING ON THE POTOMAC, AND HE WILL FERRY US ACROSS THE RIVER TO RICHMOND. THEN WE, UH, WE KILL HIM ? DAVEY, PLEASE. TRY AND PAY ATTENTION. HE'S NO GOOD TO US DEAD. WE HOLD HIM HOSTAGE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL OF OUR PRISONERS. I DON'T THINK LINCOLN'S GONNA GO QUIETLY. NEITHER DO I. TO KIDNAP THE PRESIDENT-- IF YOU GET CAUGHT, THEY HANG YOU, YEAH ? NO, GEORGE, THIS IS NOT A CRIME. WE ARE AT WAR. LINCOLN IS THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND, AS SUCH, IS LIABLE TO CAPTURE LIKE ANY OTHER SOLDIER. THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO SAVE THE SOUTH. ONE BOLD MOVE, WE GET OUR BOYS BACK, AND WE BREAK THE UNION SPIRIT AT THE SAME TIME. WE WILL NOT ONLY BE PART OF HISTORY, WE WILL MAKE HISTORY. WHO WILL STAND WITH ME ? I'LL FOLLOW YOU TO HELL, CAP. YOU KNOW THAT. I-I'M WITH YOU, JOHNNY. YEAH. YEAH. I WILL HELP YOU. WE'LL NEED SOME HORSES. [Chattering] [Chattering Continues] * [Waltz] GOOD EVENING, SIR. EVENING. HAVE YOU SEEN LUCY HALE? YES. BACK THERE. HELLO. HOW DO YOU DO ? SUCH A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. EVENIN'. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, JOHN. GOOD EVENING, SENATOR HALE. GOOD EVENING, LADIES, GENTLEMEN. MAY I SAY YOURS IS A FINE LOOKING TABLE. MY APOLOGIES FOR INTERRUPTING YOUR DINNER, BUT I FIND I MUST HAVE A DANCE WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN... THAT HAS EVER GRACED THIS BALL. MISS HALE IS IN THE MIDDLE OF DINNER, SIR. PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME. MADAM, MAY I ? I'D BE DELIGHTED. EXCUSE ME, FATHER. HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? [ Chuckles ] I'VE GONE MAD FOR YOU. HAVE I CAUSED YOU SOME TROUBLE, MISS LUCY ? SEEING AS HOW MY FATHER'S JAW IS RESTING IN HIS SOUP, I'D HAVE TO SAY YES. I DON'T WANT TO HIDE ANYMORE, LUCY. I'M MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW THAT ? NO, JOHN, I DON'T. AW, DARLIN', IT'S TRUE. I FEEL AS IF I-- I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. ARE YOU ALRIGHT? HAVE YOU HIT YOUR HEAD ON SOMETHING? YES. IN A WAY, I HAVE. ALL OF MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN SO AFRAID... THAT I WOULD NEVER MAKE A MARK IN THIS WORLD, THAT I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT MATTERED. HOW FOOLISH. YOU'RE A BRILLIANT ACTOR. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. NOT AS BRILLIANT AS MY BROTHERS OR MY FATHER. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. NO, THEY WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR THEIR WORK. NOT I. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'LL BE JUDGED, JOHN. OH, I DO. I FOUND MY WAY. IT'S AS CLEAR TO ME AS YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE. [Giggles] I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, JOHN, BUT DON'T DARE STOP. UH-HUH. [Both Chuckling] WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT ? I BELIEVE HE WALKED OVER TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT. HE'S WAITING FOR NEWS ON RICHMOND. DID YOU LET HIM GO ALONE ? NO, MA'AM. MR. CROOK WAS WITH HIM. DID HE PUT HIS GLOVES ON? I DON'T KNOW, MA'AM. WHAT IS THAT? JUST SOME MAIL TO BE SEPARATED. FOR THE PRESIDENT. MAY I SEE IT ? IT'S REALLY NOTHING, MA'AM. REQUESTS FOR POSITIONS AND SUCH. I HAVE ASKED TO PLEASE SEE WHAT YOU ARE HOLDING, MR. NICOLAY. DEAR GOD. MORE DEATH THREATS. YES, MA'AM. MORE COME EVERY WEEK. WHY WAS I NOT SHOWN THESE? THE PRESIDENT HAS INSTRUCTED ME-- THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT DEATH THREATS. NEITHER SHOULD YOU, MOTHER. FATHER, WHY DID YOU NOT SHOW ME THESE ? BECAUSE THEY MEAN NOTHING. YOU MUSTN'T CONCERN YOURSELF WITH THESE. I AM AS SAFE AS I CAN BE. IS THAT SAFE ENOUGH ? PLEASE, MOTHER. THERE ARE JUST AS MANY LETTERS SAYING THAT I AM A SAINT... AND SHALL LIVE FOREVER. I SUSPECT THE TRUTH LIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. MR. NICOLAY, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW THOSE LETTERS TO MOTHER? YES, MR. PRESIDENT. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU KEEP THINGS FROM ME. PLEASE, COME AND TALK TO ME WHEN YOU CAN, FATHER. THERE ARE SOME ENGAGEMENTS WE NEED TO CONFIRM. WE HAVE NO SUCH LETTERS. [Whispering] WRITE SOME. MRS. LINCOLN IS CORRECT TO BE WORRIED. YOU DO NOT EMPLOY SUFFICIENT SECURITY. LOOK AT THAT LINE OF PEOPLE YOU SEE EVERY DAY. ANY ONE OF THEM COULD BE AN ASSASSIN. I'M THEIR PRESIDENT, CROOK. WHAT SHALL I DO? BAR THEM? WE CAN AT LEAST ALLOW MORE GUARDS. YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES. MEN ON HORSEBACK WITH WEAPONS-- IT HAS BEEN MY BELIEF THAT IN A COUNTRY LIKE THIS, ASSASSINATION IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE... WILL COME IF THEY ARE DETERMINED ENOUGH ABOUT IT. WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT EASY. MR. STANTON IS HERE, SIR. TELL HIM HE IS ONLY WELCOME IF HE HAS NEWS OF RICHMOND. BY THE HAND OF A MURDERER, DEAR CROOK, I CAN DIE BUT ONCE, BUT TO GO CONTINUALLY IN FEAR, I WOULD DIE OVER AND OVER. THE ESTEEMED SECRETARY OF WAR. I HOPE YOU'RE HERE TO TAKE MY MIND OFF THE IMPENDING DOOM EVERYONE SEES AROUND ME. YES, SIR. I AM, SIR. RICHMOND HAS FALLEN. THANK GOD. I EXPECTED IT, YET I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ECSTATIC, MR. PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT SO TOO. I AM PLEASED AND RELIEVED, BELIEVE ME. BUT I FEEL-- I DON'T KNOW-- SADDENED BY WHAT IT TOOK US TO GET HERE. SO MUCH LOSS. SURELY, IT WILL BE OVER SOON. I MUST GO TO RICHMOND RIGHT AWAY. MR. PRESIDENT-- IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. OH, GOOD LORD. NOT YOU TOO, STANTON. I HAVE TO GO TO RICHMOND. SEE THE PEOPLE. LET THEM SEE ME. BRING THE CITY BACK INTO THE FOLD. SIR, YOU WILL BE IN GREAT DANGER. WE CANNOT RISK IT. NO. YOU ARE A GOOD MAN, STANTON. I PARTICULARLY ENJOY YOUR WHISKERS. BUT THIS PRESIDENT DECIDES WHAT CAN OR CANNOT BE RISKED, NOT YOU. I WILL GO TO RICHMOND. NICOLAY-- [Mrs. Surratt] JUST BECAUSE RICHMOND HAS FALLEN DOESN'T MEAN... THE CAUSE IS LOST. IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, YOU ALL WOULD BE CONTENT TO SIT IN THE DARK. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? NOTHING TO DO. IT'S OVER. I'M GOIN' BACK TO CANADA MONDAY. NOTHIN' FOR ME TO DO HERE ANYMORE. [Paine] WHAT ABOUT YOU, CAP? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? * GENTLE AS THE TONGUE CAN TELL * * WAS OUR LITTLE LAUGHING DARLING * * SWEET VIRGINIA BELLE * [All Singing] * BRIGHT VIRGINIA BELLE * * OUR DEAR VIRGINIA BELLE * * SHE BEREFT US WHEN SHE LEFT US * * SWEET VIRGINIA BELLE * * BRIGHT VIRGINIA BELLE * * OUR DEAR * [People Cheering] * VIRGINIA BELLE * [Guns Firing] * SHE BEREFT US WHEN SHE LEFT US * * SWEET VIRGINIA BELLE ** MY APOLOGIES FOR... APPEARIN' BEFORE YOU IN THIS DISGRACEFUL CONDITION, BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I'M SURE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. HAVE I MENTIONED HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK THIS EVENIN'? IN FACT, BOTH OF YOU DO. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, JOHN? I WISH I KNEW. SHOOT ME, PERHAPS. I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU ALL DAY. I TRIED TO FIND YOU. I BROUGHT-- I BROUGHT THIS GARDENIA FOR YOU, LUCY. JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND JUST... BREATHE THAT IN. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. SHH. CLOSE YOUR EYES. [Whispering] THAT IS THE SMELL OF SOFT SUMMER NIGHTS. HOT DAYS. COOL EVENINGS. THAT IS THE SMELL OF NOBILITY... AND CIVILITY... AND OF TRADITION. OF EVERYTHING THAT I LOVE. IT'S ALL GONE NOW. DES-- DESTROYED... BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN. HE HAS TAKEN AWAY OUR WAY OF LIFE, OUR DIGNITY. MY GOD. I HAVE NO COUNTRY. IT'S ALRIGHT. NO, DON'T KNEEL. OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU SHOULD KNEEL BEFORE GOD ONLY. GOD BLESS YOU. JESUS BLESS YOU. FATHER. UH, THE PRESIDENT'S HERE. HE'S HERE ? HAVE YOU COME TO CHEER ME UP, MR. PRESIDENT? AND HOW IS OUR PATIENT TODAY? [ Sniffs ] PATRICK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S INJURED MORE, MY BODY OR MY PRIDE. YOUR PRIDE, I'M SURE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULDN'T BE IN THE HABIT OF GETTING THROWN FROM HIS CARRIAGE. CONSIDER IT A HABIT BROKEN. I HEAR YOU WENT TO RICHMOND. DAMN FOOL THING TO DO. I THINK THE WAR IS FINALLY OVER. LEE'S ARMY IS DYING. GOOD. GOOD FOR YOU. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY TOGETHER, SEWARD. FROM THE TIME YOU STOLE THE NOMINATION FROM ME. STOLE IT FAIR AND SQUARE. NOTHING PERSONAL. JUST POLITICS. [Chuckles] I OWE YOU A GREAT DEAL. YOU TURNED A PRAIRIE LAWYER INTO SOMETHING OF A PRESIDENT. IT WAS MY PLEASURE, MR. PRESIDENT. AND MINE. GET ON YOUR FEET, SEWARD. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THE SOUTH EXPECTS US TO PUNISH THEM, BUT WE'RE GOING TO FORGIVE THEM. I'LL NEED YOU. [Heavy Sighing] LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THIS CITY ONLY HURTS YOU. I JUST WANT TO BE WITH YOU. LUCY, DARLING, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT'S BEST NOT TO SPEAK, AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES. [ Fireworks Exploding ] [ Cheering ] [Booth] JIM ! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? LEE SURRENDERED, JOHNNIE. THE WAR'S OVER. THE WAR'S OVER ! [Cheering] FELLOW CITIZENS, I AM VERY GREATLY REJOICED, AND AN OCCASION HAS OCCURRED... THAT IS SO PLEASURABLE THAT THE PEOPLE CANNOT RESTRAIN THEMSELVES. HELL, JOHNNIE, I FEEL FAMOUS MYSELF WHEN I'M WALKIN' WITH YOU. [Lincoln] I SUPPOSE A FORMAL DEMONSTRATION UH, THIS, OR PERHAPS... TOMORROW NIGHT IS PLANNED. [ Lincoln Continues Speaking ] SORRY I'M LATE. WHOEVER PLANNED THIS TOWN IS A DAMNED MORON. NOTHIN' MAKES SENSE. THIS CITY WAS LAID OUT BY A FRENCHMAN. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ? AT LEAST IT-- SHH. KING ABRAHAM SPEAKS. IT IS ALSO UNSATISFACTORY TO SOME THAT THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE... HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO THE COLORED MAN. I WOULD MYSELF PREFER THAT IT WERE NOW CONFERRED ON THE VERY INTELLIGENT, AND THOSE WHO SERVED IN OUR CAUSE AS SOLDIERS. [ Crowd Applauding ] WELL, IF INTELLIGENCE IS A CRITERIA, HE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO VOTE HIMSELF. WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY ELECTIVE FRANCHISE ? NIGGER CITIZENSHIP IS WHAT THAT MEANS. RUBBIN' OUR NOSES IN IT IS WHAT IT MEANS. I KNEW IT. GOD, I SHALL PUT HIM THROUGH. I SEE A BAND. I HAVE A REQUEST. THERE IS A SONG THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW IT IS AGAIN U.S. PROPERTY. WOULD YOU PLEASE PLAY &quot;DIXIE&quot; FOR US? &quot;DIXIE&quot;? ** [&quot;Dixie&quot;] [Man] THERE'S TAD ! [Woman] OH, WHAT A LITTLE RAPSCALLION! [ Cheering ] I'M GONNA BE SICK. THAT IS THE LAST SPEECH YOU WILL EVER MAKE. WHY DON'T YOU ROUND UP OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES? LET'S MEET TONIGHT AT MARY SURRATT'S ABOUT 9:00. ALRIGHT, CAP. SIR ? YES. THANK YOU. LADIES. HE SUSPENDS HABEAS CORPUS, ALLOWIN' MEN TO BE LOCKED UP FOR MONTHS... WITH NO FORMAL CHARGES, SIMPLY FOR SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT? NOW HE'S GONNA GIVE NIGGERS THE VOTE? CITIZENSHIP IS SURE TO BE NEXT. THIS IS NOT A PRESIDENT. THIS IS A DICTATOR. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH A DICTATOR. YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO, CAP. I'M READY. WE WILL ATTACK ALONG CONSTITUTIONAL LINES. PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WE TAKE CARE OF THEM, AND WE THROW THE NORTH INTO TOTAL CHAOS. WHO KNOWS? THERE MIGHT JUST BE ENOUGH CONFUSION FOR JOHNSON TO MOUNT ANOTHER OFFENSIVE. HOW DO WE GET TO LINCOLN ? DON'T KNOW YET. MAYBE IN HIS OFFICE. HE LETS IN ANY DAMN FOOL OFF THE STREET TO SEE HIM. WHAT'S THIS MEAN WHEN YOU SAY &quot;TAKE CARE OF THEM&quot;? I MEAN KILL, OLD SON, KILL. &quot;THROW AWAY RESPECT, TRADITION, FORM AND CEREMONIOUS DUTY, &quot;FOR YOU HAVE MISTOOK ME ALL THIS WHILE. &quot;I LIVE WITH BREAD LIKE YOU, &quot;FEEL WANT, TASTE GRIEF, &quot;NEED FRIENDS. &quot;SUBJECTED THUS, HOW CAN YOU SAY TO ME I AM A KING?&quot; [ All Applauding ] AH, MRS. LINCOLN. DO YOU THINK HE WOULD PREFER YOU ? I BEG YOUR PARDON ? I SUPPOSE YOU THINK YOU'LL GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE YOURSELF. I'M SORRY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND-- I HAVE SEEN THE LIKES OF YOU OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NOW, I NEVER LET MY HUSBAND SEE A WOMAN ALONE. YOU REMEMBER THAT. REMEMBER THAT. YES. I WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND. HENRY, WE SHOULD BE GOING. YES, YOU SHOULD BE. NOW, MOTHER, IT'S BEEN A VERY NICE EVENING. DO YOU THINK I'M BLIND ? THAT I WOULD NOT NOTICE HOW YOU FAVORED HER? LET'S SHOW OUR GUEST TO THE DOOR. I WILL NOT ! SENATOR, I APOLOGIZE. MY WIFE'S NOT-- THINK NOTHING OF IT, MR. PRESIDENT. THEN AGAIN, YOU FOLKS SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAND FOR 20 MINUTES... WHAT I HAVE STOOD FOR OVER 20 YEARS. [ Both Laughing ] [ Woman Sobbing ] [ Sobbing Continues ] [ Woman Whispering ] [ Woman Shuddering ] [ Man Whispering ] [ Man Shouting ] WHO IS DEAD IN THE WHITE HOUSE ? OUR PRESIDENT. HE WAS KILLED BY AN ASSASSIN. [ Gasps ] [ Booth ] RIGHT OR WRONG, GOD JUDGE ME, NOT MAN. FOR BE MY MOTIVE GOOD OR BAD, OF ONE THING I AM SURE: THE LASTING CONDEMNATION OF THE NORTH. I HAVE EVER HELD... THAT THE SOUTH WERE RIGHT. THE VERY NOMINATION... OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN PLAINLY SPOKE WAR, WAR UPON SOUTHERN RIGHTS... AND INSTITUTIONS. HIS ELECTION PROVED IT. I AM A CONFEDERATE... DOING HIS DUTY... UPON HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU, SIR. CAPTAIN LINCOLN. WHAT A NICE SURPRISE. YOUR FATHER WILL BE VERY PLEASED TO SEE YOU. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, CROOK. YOU LOOK WELL. THANK YOU, SIR. HOW IS HE ? HE'S TIRED, BUT HAPPY, AND ABOUT TO BE A LOT HAPPIER, I EXPECT. COME ON IN. ANOTHER REQUEST FOR A PARDON. A NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD BOY. THEY WANT TO SHOOT HIM FOR COWARDICE FOR RUNNING FROM A BATTLE. A VERY SENSIBLE REACTION WHEN SOMEBODY'S SHOOTING A GUN AT YOU. I THINK THIS BOY COULD DO MORE GOOD ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER GROUND. THEY SAY I DESTROY DISCIPLINE, AND I'M CRUEL TO THE ARMY... WHEN I DON'T LET 'EM SHOOT A SOLDIER, BUT I CANNOT SEE IT. IF GOD WANTED ME TO SEE IT, I'LL KNOW, AND UNTIL HE DOES, I SHALL GO ON PARDONING AND BEING CRUEL TO THE END. THERE'S MY BOY, ALL GROWN UP. FATHER. [ Chuckles ] WELCOME BACK, SON. WELCOME BACK. AND THERE SITS GENERAL LEE, WITH HIS WHITE HAIR AND HIS SPOTLESS UNIFORM AND GOLD SPURS, SITTING WITH GENERAL GRANT, ALL STOOPED OVER IN A MUDDY UNIFORM, NO SWORD, WEARING A PRIVATE'S BLOUSE. WELL, NOW THE WAR'S CLOSED. WE'VE TO FIND A WAY TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THOSE WHO FOUGHT AGAINST US. FATHER, I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING. IT'S A GOOD FACE-- THE FACE OF A BRAVE MAN. [ Lincoln ] I'M GLAD THE WAR'S FINALLY OVER FOR HIM TOO. HMM. YOU SHOULD HANG HIM. [ Mrs. Lincoln ] HIM AND DAVIS AND THE LOT OF THEM. TRAITORS. HAS GENERAL GRANT ARRIVED YET? NO, HE'S SUPPOSED TO COME TODAY. PLEASE REMIND HIM THAT HE HAS NOT RESPONDED... TO OUR INVITATION FOR THE THEATER YET. OH, ROBERT. WE'RE GOING TO SEE LAURA KEENE IN OUR AMERICAN COUSIN TONIGHT. PLEASE SAY YOU'LL COME. WELL, I-- OH, YOU MUST. OUR SON HAS NOT SLEPT IN A PROPER BED IN QUITE SOME TIME. LET HIM GET SOME REST. MAY I LET YOU KNOW LATER, MOTHER? YES, OF COURSE, DEAR. IT'S SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU HOME. ALL OF MY MEN HERE WITH ME. [ Whistling ] BOOTH. GOOD TO SEE YOU. MY FRIEND JIM. ANY MAIL FOR ME? I THINK SO. HOLD ON. YOU OUT LATE CELEBRATING THE BIG VICTORY? YEAH. THEY TELL ME I HAD A VERY GOOD TIME. HERE. NED? YEAH ? GET SOME BUNTING TO PUT UP AROUND THE BOX. HAVE GIFFORD TAKE THE PARTITION DOWN BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT. YES, SIR, MR. FORD. NICE DAY, JOHN. NED, OLD BOY. WHAT'S ALL THIS ? GREAT BIT OF LUCK. PRESIDENT ASKED FOR HIS BOX TONIGHT. TONIGHT ? YEAH. GENERAL GRANT TOO. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH, AND DAVIS AND LEE IN THE NEXT BOX. HOLD ON. LINCOLN AND GRANT, TONIGHT. AND THANK GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD FRIDAY'S LIKE. NOW WE'LL HAVE A SELLOUT FOR SURE. GREAT TALKIN' TO YOU, JOHN. BEFORE I SEE THE OLD MAN, I NEED YOUR ADVICE. WELL, GRANT, I'VE BEEN TAKING YOURS ALL MORNING. TELL ME. MRS. LINCOLN HAS INVITED MY WIFE AND ME TO THE THEATER TONIGHT. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT EXPOSE HIMSELF IN THIS WAY. WELL, I'M SURE THE FIRST LADY HAS FORGOTTEN SHE USED TO REFER TO ME AS &quot;THE BUTCHER&quot;, BUT MY WIFE HAS MADE IT PLAIN SHE WON'T SIT IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MRS. LINCOLN. A SENTIMENT SHE IS NOT ALONE WITH. I PROMISED JULIA WE'D VISIT OUR CHILDREN IN BURLINGTON. NOW, I'M NOT A SOCIAL MAN. I-- I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING AWKWARD HERE. WELL, IT'S SIMPLE. TELL THE PRESIDENT YOU REGRET IT, BUT YOU'RE UNABLE TO ATTEND BECAUSE YOU'RE LEAVING FOR NEW JERSEY TO SEE YOUR CHILDREN. MAYBE IT WILL DISCOURAGE HIM FROM GOING TO THE THEATER HIMSELF. HE DOESN'T REALIZE THE KIND OF DANGER HE'S IN. [ Actors Rehearsing Lines ] [ Woman #1 ] WHAT? NO FORTUNE? [ Man ] YOU'RE BARKIN' UP THE WRONG TREE ABOUT THE OLD MAN'S PROPERTY. [ Woman #2 ] WHICH HE LEFT TO YOU. [ Man ] OH, NO. [ Woman #1 ] NOT TO YOU ? [ Man ] NO. HE MEANT TO LEAVE BUT THOUGHT BETTER ON IT HE LEFT IT TO HIS GRANDDAUGHTER MISS MARY ELIZABETH. [ Woman #2 ] MISS MARY ELIZABETH ? OH, I'M DELIGHTED. [ Woman #2 ] DELIGHTED ? [ Man ] YES, I CAN TELL YOU'RE BOTH TICKLED TO DEATH. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS STUFF HERE. [ Woman #2 ] MR. TRENCHARD, I WILL PLEASE ASK YOU TO RECOLLECT... THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING MY DAUGHTER, AND IN MY PRESENCE. [ Trenchard ] I'M ONLY OFFERING HER MY HEART AND HAND, AS SHE WANTS. THERE'S NOTHIN' IN 'EM. [ Daughter ] LUSTY BEAST ! [ Woman #2 ] I AM AWARE, MR. TRENCHARD, THAT YOU ARE NOT USED TO... THE MANNERS OF GOOD SOCIETY, AND THAT ALONE WILL EXCUSE THE IMPERTINENCE... OF WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN GUILTY. DON'T KNOW THE MANNERS OF GOOD SOCIETY, HUH? WELL, I GUESS I KNOW ENOUGH TO TURN YOU INSIDE OUT, OLD, GAL. YOU SOCKDOLOGIZING OLD MANTRAP. [ All Laughing ] WELL, NOW. WHEN I THINK OF WHAT I THROWED AWAY IN HARD CASH TODAY, I AM APT TO CALL MYSELF SOME AWFUL HARD NAMES. $400,000 IN A BIG PILE... [ Dialogue Fades ] THEY ARE TRAITORS: LEE, DAVIS, THE WHOLE LOT. WHETHER OR NOT THEY DESERVE TO HANG IS BESIDE THE POINT. THE PUBLIC WANTS THEM TO HANG. THEY WANT JUSTICE. THEY WANT REVENGE ! YES, PERHAPS THEY DO, AND WHY SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE THAT ? THESE MEN PUT US THROUGH HELL FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS ! MY OPINION, MR. PRESIDENT, IS THAT IT WOULD BE A PUBLIC RELATIONS DISASTER... IF THOSE MEN GO UNPUNISHED. WHICH PUBLIC, MR. SPEED? SOUTHERN OR NORTHERN? MR. PRESIDENT, WE CANNOT REWARD THE SOUTH FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE... BY SHOWING MERCY TO THEIR LEADERS. THEY WILL THINK US FOOLS. WORSE, THEY'LL THINK US SOFT. AS WILL THE WORLD. NO, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS BEYOND MORALITY. THIS IS POLITICS. THIS IS HOW WE ARE TO BE VIEWED ON THE WORLD STAGE. WHAT MY FATHER ASKED ME TO EXPRESS TO YOU HERE, IS THAT THESE MEN FOUGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVED WAS RIGHT. THEY WERE, IN THE MAIN, HONORABLE MEN. HONORABLE MEN WHO KILLED OUR BROTHERS ! YES, AS WE KILLED THEIRS ! I THINK YOUR FATHER MIGHT HAVE HIT HIS HEAD A LITTLE TOO HARD. NOT THAT HARD. THE QUESTION OF POLITICS AND MORALS IS ALWAYS A VEXING ONE. SADLY ENOUGH, WE DON'T USUALLY SEE WHAT ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE OTHER. BUT I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS A BETTER LESSON TO LEARN FROM MERCY, EVEN IF CONSTRUED AS WEAKNESS, THAN FROM CRUELTY, EVEN IF CONSTRUED AS STRENGTH. [ Stanton ] MR. PRESIDENT, WE CANNOT LET THIS OPPORTUNITY GO BY ! THEY'LL BE NO BLOODY WORK, GENTLEMEN. NO PERSECUTION. I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS! TRAITORS TO THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE-- STANTON, THESE ARE MATTERS THE PRESIDENT HOLDS IN HIS HANDS. NO ONE ELSE. THERE WILL BE NO EXECUTIONS. NO HANGINGS. NO SHOOTINGS. BY GOD, HAS ANY MAN IN THIS ROOM NOT HAD ENOUGH BLOOD ? THERE WILL BE NO MORE KILLINGS. NO MORE. HERR BOOTH ? COULD I SEE YOU ONE MINUTE, PLEASE ? OF COURSE, GEORGE. HERR BOOTH, I AM NOT LIKE YOU. I AM NOT AS SMART OR WISE-- OR SOBER. I DON'T KNOW THESE POLITICS. IT IS NOT IN ME TO KILL THESE MEN. I WON'T DO IT. GEORGE. GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF. FIRSTLY, YOU'RE DRUNK. IT'S NO WONDER YOU'RE ALL CONFUSED. AND SECOND, AS I TOLD YOU, THIS IS NOT MURDER, THIS IS AN ACT OF WAR. THE WAR IS OVER. YES, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'D LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE. THERE ARE STILL SOLDIERS IN THE FIELD. GENERAL JOHNSON'S STILL OUT THERE FIGHTING SHERMAN. JEFFERSON DAVIS IS STILL OUT THERE WAITING FOR ANOTHER CHANCE. HERR BOOTH, YOU CAME TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW THE RIVER, AND I TOLD YOU I WOULD HELP YOU CAPTURE THE PRESIDENT. BUT MURDER? NO. GEORGE, THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL DO: YOU PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER AND YOU SOBER UP. WE WILL ALL MEET AT HERNDON HOUSE TONIGHT AND GO OVER THE PLAN. AND GEORGE, YOU'LL KILL WHO I TELL YOU TO KILL, OR, SO HELP ME GOD, I'LL FIND YOU AND I WILL KILL YOU MYSELF. YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH. COME ON, NOW. BOOTH. POSTMASTER GENERAL DENNISON SHOULD REOPEN THE SOUTHERN POST OFFICES... AND REESTABLISH THE MAIL ROUTES. ATTORNEY GENERAL SPEED SHOULD LOOK AFTER THE REESTABLISHMENT OF FEDERAL COURTS: JUDGES, MARSHALS, ATTORNEYS. SECRETARY McCULLOCH, THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT SHOULD PROCEED... IN ITS COLLECTION OF REVENUES. OH, BY THE WAY, MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MORE DRAFTS. GENERAL? YES, SIR. ABSOLUTELY. GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW WHAT HAS TO BE DONE. LET'S MEET AGAIN ON TUESDAY. CONGRATULATIONS, GENERAL. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ATTEND, SIR. IT'S NOT UNLIKE BATTLE, IS IT? EXCEPT IT'S NOT AS CLEAR WHO THE ENEMY IS. MRS. LINCOLN ASKED ME TO REMIND YOU ABOUT OUR THEATER ENGAGEMENT TONIGHT. [ Clears Throat ] YES, UH, WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, I, UH-- I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT MRS. GRANT AND I HAD PLANS TO, UH, TRAVEL TO BURLINGTON TONIGHT TO SEE OUR CHILDREN. SURELY YOU CAN PUT IT OFF FOR A DAY. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE MAN THAT WON THE WAR. WELL, I'D LIKE TO OBLIGE, SIR, BUT, UH, I'M AFRAID JULIA HAS HER HEART SET ON IT. DON'T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT, GRANT. LET'S FACE IT: IT'S WOMEN THAT RUN THE WORLD, AND THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE. TRAVEL SAFELY. THANK YOU, SIR. [ Girls Giggling ] IT MUST BE NICE TO LIVE IN A FANCY HOTEL. STILL, IF YOU EVER MISS A HOME-COOKED MEAL-- I WILL KNOW WHERE TO COME. YOU'RE VERY KIND, MRS. SURRATT, I'VE A DIFFERENT KINDA FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU. A FAVOR? I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT BE... TRAVELING TO SURRATTSVILLE TODAY TO SEE MR. LLOYD. YES. I'M TRYING TO COLLECT A DEBT. I WILL SEE HIM ON THE WAY. I WONDER IF I COULD IMPOSE UPON YOU TO DELIVER THIS PACKAGE FROM ME, AND A MESSAGE. WHAT MESSAGE ? IF YOU'D BE SO KIND, PLEASE TELL HIM... TO HAVE THIS AND THE OTHER THINGS READY, AND LOUIS, DAVEY AND I'LL PICK THEM UP TONIGHT. THAT'S ALL ? YES, MA'AM. I'D BE HAPPY TO, MR. BOOTH. MUCH OBLIGED, MRS. SURRATT. THANK YOU. OH, MR. BOOTH, ARE YOU SURE I CAN'T FIX YOU SOMETHING BEFORE YOU GO ? I AM A FAIR COOK, AS YOU KNOW. DEAR LADY, YOU REMIND ME SO VERY MUCH OF MY MOTHER, ALWAYS TAKING IN STRAYS. IS YOUR MOTHER LONELY? WITH TEN CHILDREN, I'M SURE SHE SOMETIMES LONGED TO BE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE LONGED FOR, REALLY. YES, MA'AM. THANK YOU FOR SEEING TO MY ERRAND. PLEASE TAKE CARE. YOU TOO, SIR. CROOK, DO YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE, THERE ARE MEN WHO WANT TO TAKE MY LIFE, AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL DO IT ? I HOPE YOU'RE MISTAKEN, MR. PRESIDENT. I HAVE PERFECT CONFIDENCE IN EVERYONE AROUND ME, EVERY ONE OF YOU MEN. I KNOW NO ONE CAN DO IT AND ESCAPE ALIVE, BUT IF IT IS TO BE DONE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREVENT. [ Mrs. Lincoln ] FATHER ? AH. I PROMISED MOTHER A CARRIAGE RIDE. MR. PRESIDENT, I'LL GO WITH YOU TO THE THEATER TONIGHT. DON'T BE FOOLISH, CROOK. YOU'VE WORKED ALL DAY. I'LL BE FINE. YOU ARE ALWAYS FORGETTING YOUR GLOVES. MOTHER, IT IS APRIL, NOT DECEMBER. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF WEATHER, IT IS A MATTER OF GENTILITY. DON'T THINK I DON'T NOTICE YOU STUFF THEM IN YOUR POCKETS... WHEN I'M NOT LOOKING. [ Giggling ] STOP IT, PLEASE. WELL, ONE NEVER KNOWS, THAT'S ALL. YOU ARE BEING SO CHILDISH. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SO CHEERFUL IN YEARS. WHY SHOULDN'T I BE? I CONSIDER THIS DAY THAT WAR HAS COME TO A CLOSE. WE MUST BOTH BE MORE CHEERFUL IN THE FUTURE. WITH THE WAR AND WILLIE'S DEATH, WE'VE BOTH BEEN SO MISERABLE. I WANT TO GO ABROAD WHEN THIS TERM IS OVER. ENGLAND, SPAIN. OH ! I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PALESTINE. THEN WE SHALL SEE IT... WHEN ALL THIS IS BEHIND US. MARY, YOU'VE WEATHERED A LOT ON THIS ROAD WITH ME. ANY LIFE BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER IS A DIFFICULT ONE, BUT IN POLITICS, IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED... HOW I SHOULD EVER HAD GONE ON WITHOUT YOU.
