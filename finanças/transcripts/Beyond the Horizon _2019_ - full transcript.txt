It's just me... - Hey, Florin. - Gus. Has the army come by with water? No, not yet. - And the chickens? - They're all dying from the heat. - Anything else? - No, thanks. BEYOND THE HORIZON DIRECTED BY DELPHINE LEHERICEY You're not ready to catch the enemy yet... Captain Stone! - We need you right now. - I know. So what were you up to? Nothing. Have you seen the state you're in? Just look at your shirt... Dad was looking everywhere. I'm not a kid. Let me do it. All right, take it off. But I don't want to... Listen... Gus, just do it for me. There are bodies everywhere. It stinks. Stop sulking. Hurry up and get changed. I'll refill the rabbits' water. Go! Hurry up! - What, Rudy? - I'm making the sun disappear. Can you make the chickens disappear? No. We'll get shouted at. - I don't want to... - Come on, let's go. Hurry on up. All right? Still the same? Oh! You stink! Has the water been fixed? No, I'll call the council tomorrow. Are they waiting for everything to die? The Leroux family got water from the army, but not us. We're close, they can't miss us. There's no point getting angry. They won't come any quicker. Careful, it's hot. Have you seen the time? - Will this go on all summer? - You don't work anyway. Shut it. Sorry. We were kept after school. The Berlin students are here. - Oh? - We had to help them settle in. What are they like? Like us. They're just a little shy. There were issues with the host families. Why don't we have a Kraut? Didn't any of them want to stay with you? Stop that. We'll talk later. Let's eat now. Lord, bless us. And bless the food we have thanks to You. Lord, take pity on us. Christ, take pity on us. - Amen. - Amen. We're losing too many chickens. We're not selling enough. How can we raise them? It's the heat. - Can't you make it cooler? - The fans are at full power. What more can I do? I could take that job in Evaux. Part-time at the post office. Three times a week. That would help. I could talk to the bank and ask for help. Do you think they give a damn? Jean, the heat is hurting everyone. It'll cool off eventually. - Where are you going? - It's my book club tonight. What's this? An Arcadium monster. It's been kidnapped by a ship. Things look happy on your planet. Don't stay up late. Gus. Get the planks. They're in the hangar. Then take care of Bagatelle. Why do I always have to? Rudy can do it. I want you to stay put. No more running off. Your cousin can't do everything, OK? - I did it two days ago! - Enough, Gus. Captain, ready missile three! Hey, how's it going, big guy? Oi! You scared me! You're so immature! Watch your language, kid. Whatever... Why are you in here? - Did you sleep here? - Yeah. It's too hot indoors. How's things at the farm? Fine. Go take him for a long walk. Grandpa, not a long walk. He never listens to me. I said, go on a long walk. Come on. Come on. Come on. GINETTE'S SHOP Come on, come on... Are you Gus? Yeah. I'm Cécile. I'm your mum's friend. OK. She's told me lots about you. Are you curious? No. Don't you care? No, you're a great kid. It was nice meeting you. Bye, Gus. Fuck! Come on, pick them up. All right, Jean? Yeah. You? Yeah. Got a lot? The same as usual. I've had to hire more people. Rudy, don't bite your nails. Come help unload. - You holding up OK? - Yeah, yeah. - Hear about the suicide? - Yeah. It's crazy. I'll leave you to it, Jean. See you tomorrow. All right, Léa? Not too tired? - She never works! - She practises. Sure! I'm off school too! Don't start, Gus. Shit! You boys are so stupid! Do you think we have water to waste? Cut it out! Coming to bed? I'm tired. I can't take them. They're underweight. What if I lower my prices? I'll sell in bulk. With small volumes... - It's complicated. - Yeah, right. I want to raise more, but they won't grow. It isn't easy with the heat, but you'd need a larger farm. Yeah? So what should I do then? Give them to you? I'm already losing money. You'd need to be capable of handling larger volumes. - I need to work with someone else... - Do what you have to. - Say hello to your wife for me. - Yeah... Right, get to work. Hey. Hey, Gus. Hello. I'm Cécile. Sorry about him. He always does this when he sees a girl. Come in. Rudy, hey... She's one of mum's friends, OK? All right? Come on. I won't go into the sea any more! Right at the start! It's horrible. There's this girl going for a midnight swim, she gets eaten, and she just keeps on screaming... But nobody hears her. I'll go see it this week. - I want to see it too. - You can't. Jaws has a 16+ rating. That's just how it is. - You like The Ramones? - Yeah. I saw them in London. At the Roundhouse. Their only gig in Europe. They're not even played on the radio here. Where did you both meet? We met at the post office. I had read a book that Cécile had already read. And we got to chatting. Then she invited me to her book club. A book club? Yes. It's a women's group. We don't just read. We chat, we have a laugh... Is this in your home? My mother's. I've been there since my divorce. Oh? It's all right. There's no big drama behind it. - What? - We stopped getting along. Cécile started studying again. And she travels. Yes, mostly in Germany. Your mum said you play with an East Berlin orchestra? It's just a school exchange. We're doing a concert. Come if you like. I'd love to. So? - Are the German boys cute? - Well, I don't know. They're curious. They ask questions. Well... It's not all just about boys, right? What's his name? Shut up. Come on, Rudy. Let's go. Rudy, come on. Rudy, I'll keep an eye on her. She's not going anywhere. See you later. Promise? No, leave it. No, it's all right. - It's my first time. - It's good. It's really good. Keep going. No, it's OK. I'll practise on my own. - Can I try? - Sure. No, you can't. You can't... Listen to me! Come on, she's earned it. OK, all together... Didn't mean to scare you. Your... Your mum let me sleep over. I had too much to drink. Were you outside? Yeah. It was too hot, so I went out. Don't worry, I won't tell. When I was your age, I'd run off too. I had secret spots. It's all the same during the day... But at night, it changes. Good night. Good night. She's a real character. She doesn't hold back. Why do you say that? Did you hear her? It's no wonder her husband left. It was her who left him. Help me. That's odd. He's never done this before. Bagatelle! Bagatelle! Wait, wait... Where is that damn nag? Go find him. I'll stay here, in case he comes back. - What did they want? - To see my tits! Are you serious? I don't care. What are you up to? Nothing... You're looking for your horse. Do you know where he is? Maybe. Come on then! Just a little tired... OK, let's go. Come on. Let's go. He's tired. He won't move. Leave him alone. Anyway, your horse is old. He'll die, just like the rest. Come on... It's too hot. I'm heading back. Wait, Mado. I want to show you something. You're lucky you have a place you can go to when it's hot. - What do you mean? - Forget it. Your rat's stopped moving. Did you hear about the hanging? The father found him. He was all blue. He couldn't feed his cows, so he killed himself. My mum told me. I wanted to release it... Don't sulk. It's not a big deal. Did you notice how cold it is? Yeah. Are you all right? No... Actually, I will. Come on. Where were you? Haven't you caused us enough trouble? It was the horse. He's in the Pelleaux's field. Yeah, right. You were with Mado... What's with you? Gus, sit down. What's got into you? You scared me. What's going on with the horse? In the Pelleaux's field, I said. Calm down. Is Cécile not coming? Wasn't she meant to come? I don't know. She must have been held up. Dammit! I wanted her to show me something for the BBC. When is she coming next? I have no idea. Jean, people are going to die. Lots of us will have to sell. What if your chickens keep dying? With the debt you have? Best find another trade, kid... Hey, don't tell him that. - It's been tough before. - Not like this. That's why we need to organise. I've got work to do. Say hello to your parents for me. That Leroux kid has a big mouth. He thinks he knows everything. The same people always decide. Bigger farms have more influence. And all the others just keep quiet. Finish up, then we'll get the horse. You can talk to him, he won't move. Did you sleep here? I do what I want. The horse is stubborn. He won't move. - We can't leave him here. - Why not? This was his field, before you sold it. He lived here, so he'll die here. What about Pelleaux? Pelleaux can deal with it. Here, go get another one. Remind Mum about the grain. We need more this week. "I can't imagine life without you Cécile" - Why are you here? - You forgot the grain... - What's with you? - What's with you? Léa? - Where did Mum go? - Are you stupid? She got a job at the post office. Why is she working? What do you mean? We need the money. Maybe she wanted a change. All right? - Do you need a hand? - We'll manage. Are you sure? I can stay. Nice outfit. I got it for my first day. - Did it go well? - It was good. I'm just finding my feet. Rudy! Come get the grain. Look... - That smells nice. - It's for my girlfriend. Very nice, Rudy. Is that my perfume? I thought of you boys. - Shall I buy some magazines? - No. - You sure? - Don't want any. There's more choice in town. - So what? - What do you mean? I don't want any, got it? Do you understand? Gus. Come here. Gus! We haven't finished! Fucking shit! Rudy, that one's alive! Hey, Gus. All right? You could say hello. Are you sulking? Just leave him be. He hasn't got Mum all to himself now. Léa, stop. Staying for dinner? I don't know. One more person is fine. Come on, stay. Great! Hey, Rudy. Rudy. Dinner's ready! Come on, have a seat. Put the news on. - Again? We already know everything's dying. I said, put the news on. Stop... Rudy... Bless us, Lord. And the food we have thanks to You. Lord, take pity on us. Christ, take pity on us. Amen. What is it, Rudy? - Smell... Easy, Rudy. Smell... - OK, we smelled it. - You smell really nice... - It's my cologne. - Rudy! Leave her alone. - Where are you going? - With your Kraut again? - What? - I saw you snogging him. It's none of your business! - Keep your mouth shut. - That's not up to you. - Where's Mum? - How do I know? Hey! Watch your tone! Where were you? Nowhere. I walked the dog. He's been tied up all day. - Did you call about the water? - Yes. - What did the council say? - It's a zoning problem. There was a mix-up. They'll come this week. Why tell me this just now? Isn't it important? What's the difference? They're coming! You think I don't know you run off? That you're not meant to be here? That you want to be elsewhere? It's all right. With the farm, we've never depended on anyone. Everything we need, we grow and raise ourselves. See? That's why I took over from Grandpa. I didn't want to be a worker or an employee. But now... It's all gone. You can't do what you want. You keep chickens this way, you can only sell so many... You have no say in things. You become a slave. So you... Do what you want. Gus, I need a hand. Gus? Gus! All right, Rudy? This is for you. It's very sweet, but... You already gave me one. - Take it. - Rudy, it's yours. Here... Wait, wait... This is for you. Rudy, Rudy... You're hurting me! That's too hard, Rudy. Gus... Gus! Get off her, Rudy! Get off her! Are you all right? Are you hurt? Why didn't you do anything? Come on... He didn't mean anything. Right, Rudy? You didn't see it. It could have been serious. Why was she still here? Is that all? Won't you say anything? Rudy. Next time, don't be stupid. All right? How's that? Can we eat now? I can help you with the chickens. They're all dying, right? Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean I can't help... It's all right. I'm getting by. Where's Léa? She's having dinner with the orchestra. Eat, Gus. Where's the meat? Eating meat every day isn't good for you. - What's this bullshit? - It's not bullshit. Did she tell you that? Where are you going? - The dinner. No, not dressed like that. Mum! You can go, but be back before midnight. Do you think I'm stupid? That I don't know what's going on? Finish your meal, Gus. Did you think you could keep the both of us? One day me, one day her? And that I'd turn a blind eye? Do you think I planned any of this? That I knew it would turn out like this? Stop! Stop treating me like an idiot! Stop it! Why are you doing this? What did I do to deserve this? I put food on the table! I've given you everything! - Jean... - Just tell me. What does she do for you? I don't know! I don't know! Do you think this is easy? I didn't... I'm warning you. I don't want you to see her. Ever. Get over it. Don't talk to her, got it? I don't want her here. - Go to bed, Gus. - You go too. Do you want some coffee? Léa? Do you hear that? Fuck! I don't believe this! Rudy, help me! Help with the ladder. Don't just stand there! What are you doing, Gus? Pick them up! Come on! Come on! Get moving! We need air! We need air! - Hey, Jean. - Hey. What's up? You need to take your horse. It can't stay. What's the harm? I've got enough problems already. - I'll use the tractor to get it out. - Just let it die here. Hold on, Jean. This is my field. If I want it gone, I don't need to explain. You hear me? What's wrong, Jean? Is it... The dyke? Who's with your wife? Is there no room in the bed? Stop, Jean! Calm down! Stop! Oh, shit... All right? - Why is she here? - She's leaving. She came for the books. Jean... Stop! Jean, let go of her! Jean, stop! Let go! Jean, no! Stop, Dad! Let go of her! Are you crazy? You could've killed her! Look at me! Look at me! Are you OK? I'm fine, don't worry. Mum? Will she go to the hospital? She might've done. Go! Go! Come on then. It'd make me happy for once. Mum! Where are you going? Gus... Gus. Come here. This isn't easy. You're a big boy now. Are you OK, Gus? Why are you here? Where'd you find this? Put it down! Is it because of your mum? Everyone says she's sleeping with a girl. But it doesn't bother me. Shut up. She's not sleeping with anyone! Calm down. At least you're not treated as a bastard. You know what? - It's no surprise your mum beats you. - Don't be mean. So I'm the bad guy? - Fuck off! Leave me alone! - Gus, that hurts! - I didn't want this! - You're hurting me! Dad! What happened to you? Léa! Come here! What happened? Sit down. Dad, what happened to you? They were outside the bar... Undress him. I'll get bandages. - Shouldn't we call a doctor? - He's just wasted. Does it hurt? Throw this out. Help me, Gus. It's my field... If Bagatelle wants to die there, he can die there... You should've seen Leroux's face... - Why did she leave? - I don't know, Gus. Maybe she didn't have a choice. No point in sulking. It'll be all right. Jean isn't here. He'll come. No. He's left. Like Nicole. Gus! Stop! You have to put water on first. You do it like this... - What's wrong, Rudy? - The dog is gone. No, Rudy. He's in the shade. Jean wasn't here for the cows this morning. I can't do it all on my own. He's resting. Jean never rests while the sun is up. Is the Sutter family here? Where's your father? He needs to sign for the water. - He's ill. He's sleeping. - Your mother then. She's at work. I can sign for it. You? It's fine. Let him sign. OK, sign here. - Here? - Yeah. Come on, we'll give you a ride. Gus? Gus! It's night. We need to eat. - What? - We need to eat. Rudy, I'll make you some toast. But it's not for the night! Who cares? - Haven't you eaten? - No. I'll cook some eggs. - Is Dad all right? - He's still sleeping. I'll make him something. Rudy. Haven't you got any other shirts? They're all dirty. Nicole washes them. I'll get a new one. - Where's Jean? - He's sick. - He's dead! - Rudy! Stop saying dumb stuff! We told you, he's sick. Wait! Wait, wait... Come on, Rudy. It's all right. It's not all right! - Where was he? - Don't worry about it. Who's a naughty dog? Where were you, boy? Hey, want to see something cool? I don't know. Come on, you'll love it. I'm sorry. What I did to you was horrible. OK, can I show you my amazing thing? OK, I'll get changed. - Do you like it? - Is there anybody here? Not at this time. The guard's sleeping. - There's a guard? - Yeah. Why? You scared? No. Never seen a girl naked before? Imagine everyone else burning up! Burning up! Why are you bright red? Are you cold? No. Where were you? We need to get the chickens! Dad! Take the ones that are alive! Gus, take the ones that are alive! Help us! It's going to be alright! Where's Rudy? Rudy? Rudy! Rudy! No! Rudy! Help me! Get his legs! Rudy! Rudy, don't... Keep fighting! Please! We need to tell Mum. Dad... Tell her he's in a coma. She'll want to go see him. Tell her. I don't want her here. - Give that here... - Don't! They're Rudy's. They're for when he wakes up. It'll be alright, Bagatelle. It'll be alright, big guy. See you later.
