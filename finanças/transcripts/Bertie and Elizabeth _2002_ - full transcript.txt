(poignant music) (sighing) - I don't like your face Bertie. I do not think it's the kind of face that should be seen in society. Hm. (poignant music) - That button should not be undone. I did not create you, Duke of York, for you to walk around with your buttons undone. - S-Sorry, Father. - People who walk around with their buttons undone are cads. Your duty is to set an example. One of the ways you can do this is by doing up your buttons! - Y-Yes, Father. - Bertie, we should be late. Bertie, shoulders. - Hm. (relaxing music) (guests chattering) (guests applauding) - Th-That girl you were dancing with-- - Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, sir, a daughter of the Earl of Strathmore. - I might want you to introduce me to her. - [Man] There's a bit of a queue at the moment, sir. - [Man] May I have this dance please? - It'd be a pleasure. (relaxing music) Weren't you in the Navy during the war? - Yes. I spent most of my time rolling around the deck in agony. - Oh heavens, were you wounded? - Stomach ulcer, actually. - Oh. - There were time when I thought a wound would've been preferable. (chuckling) - I was a nurse. We turned Glamis into a kind of hospital. Those poor young men. And now here we are, all having fun, as if it never happened. - What was it that French chap said? "Never talk about it, always think about it." An extraordinary thing has just happened. - Did I tread on your foot? - I didn't stammer! I, I didn't stammer once! (guns firing) (pleasant music) - I think you may have winged a beater, sir. - What? Oh God, are you sure? - We'd better let him have a fiver, sir. - Elizabeth! I think I may have peppered one of your beaters. - [Elizabeth] Oh Lord. Honestly, Bertie. - I think my son is rather keen on the Strathmore girl. - I formed that impression too. - Well we could do worse than marry Bertie to a member of the British aristocracy. I mean some of them are quite respectable. Well yourself for example. (chuckles) - Has it ever been done? Isn't royal blood supposed to be a unique asset? Surely she'd be the first commoner to marry into the royal family since, um... - Anne Boleyn. - Well that didn't work out, did it? - Well my understanding is that until he had her beheaded, the while thing was a resounding success. (guns firing) - That should make us level! - You're quite competitive underneath all that, aren't you? - Well of course, that's why I like shooting with you. No competition! - But really! (chuckling) - [Announcer] The result of the Princess Mary Silver Cup-- (cork popping) (announcer chattering) - The working man needs to work. If we can't offer the Welsh miners work, then we might as well-- - We should offer them champagne. - I'm serious. There's a strong danger the miners will be tempted by Bolsheviks. - Isn't Lenin the most appalling little man? Well what do you think of Bolshevism, Bertie? - I try not to think about it, actually. - Oh no, my, my brother has a very strong social conscience. He's devised a sort of a residential camp whereby he takes boys from the slums and so on, puts them together with boys from wealthier families, and they all, well what do they do exactly, Bertie? - Well they, you know, play games and... - Have fun. - Yes, yes that's it. - Anyway, take Glasgow for instance, I was up there last week-- - I can't sort of put it into words like him. Don't you think he's marvelous? - Of course he is, he's your brother. And he doesn't mind being noticed, which must have its uses if you're going to be a king. - I hate being noticed. - I shall ignore you then. - Oh no, oh no, don't do that, please. (tender music) (ball thumping) - [Man] You seem troubled, sir. (panting) - Well, I'm in love with a girl. And I, I'm absolutely completely and utterly in love with her, and I want to marry her. And I'm at my wit's end to know what to do about it. - Well you could try asking her, sir. - No that's not really possible, I'm afraid. Ah, if you're me, I mean, if you're a member of the royal family, do you see, you're not supposed to ask people to marry you. - [Man] Why ever not? - Well, Father would never allow it. In case they turned you down, that would never do, do you see? We sent an emissary to see how the land lay. - And what happened? (sighs) - She told him to bugger off. (chuckling) And I really do not know what I should do. I'm so in love with her, you see. - I think you should ask her yourself, sir. (sighs) - Fighting talk, Davidson. - My wife turned me down three times before she said yes. I just had to keep asking her and asking her, and eventually she sort of gave in. - Extraordinary people, women. - You can't expect a high-spirited girl to say yes to an emissary. This is 1922. - Not in Buckingham Palace it isn't. - Have you seen Bertie? - He drops in, I think in the hope of seeing you. - Oh dear. - He's terribly sweet, Elizabeth. I think he's much the nicest of the brothers. - Yes he is. But do I want to be the king's daughter-in-law? (giggling) Oh wouldn't it be rather like winning crafts? - Actually, you wave rather well. And he's only a Duke of York. You don't have to wear a crown or anything. - Mm. - Elizabeth. I've asked you to marry me. - You haven't asked me. You simple put out feelers, like an insect. (chuckling) - What? (buzzing) (giggling) - Bertie, we can't communicate through third parties for the rest of our lives. We'll end up writing notes to each other and passing them down the table. - That would never do, you wouldn't be able to read my handwriting. - Oh, Bertie. (giggling) - I'm asking you to marry me, Elizabeth. Just don't imagine I'm going to ask you again. - You can be quite decisive when you want to be, can't you? - Ah... (pensive music) - Of course I'll marry you. - Yah! (giggling) Ooh! - You're gonna have to stop behaving like that. What on earth are you doing? - It's from Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree. My boys and I do it at camp, go... Ooh! - You're ridiculous. You're quite ridiculous. - Yes, I am, I'm ridiculous, and serious, and decisive, and indecisive, and frightfully humble, and terribly, terribly proud. Hath not the prince arms, hath not the prince eyes, doth not the violet smell as sweet to him as it does to you? - I don't think that's quite how it goes, but you do speak it beautifully. - When I'm with you, I do speak beautifully. (pleasant music) - Oh, Bertie (giggles)! - Elizabeth. - Where have you been, David? - I've been abroad, Father. - Abroad is bloody. Why have you been abroad? Listening to jazz, drinking cocktails? Where will it end? - The train you're lending me for the wedding, ma'am, it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. - It belonged to somebody. Not Anne of Cleves, someone along those lines. Where did that fat woman from Saxe-Coburg go to, my dear? - My feeling, sir, is that the wedding of these two young people, the Duke and Duchess of York, should be filmed, if that is thought appropriate, but not allowed to be recorded over the wireless. People might listen to it in inappropriate places. (chuckles) - What exactly do you mean by that? - Public houses, for example. They might also not remove their hats at solemn moments. - Why this obsession with ritual? - Monarchy is ritual, boy. That's why. Doing things in the prescribed manner. You've read your Badgett. Monarchy is magical. And you can't let daylight in upon a magic. Little by little the newspaper boys, the wireless boys, will be flashing their cameras and poking their microphones under your noses, and one morning you'll wake up, and there won't be any magic. There won't be any monarchy either. (clearing throat) - This is a serious matter David. There was an unfortunate photograph of you in the newspapers the other day, wearing what they referred to as bell-bottoms. (coughs) It won't do. - We thought Bertie might wear his RAF dress uniform. - Thoroughly appropriate, my dear. - We must withdraw, Elizabeth, make plans. There's no fun talking about weddings when there are men present. (clock chimes ringing) - Marriage, my boy. Take a leaf out of Bertie's book. Don't stand around drinking cocktails looking like a wet weekend. Get married. Happy where you are, Bertie? - And where am I? - You're in the middle, of course. Seriously though, first class performance. You, quite superb. Audible, very, very audible. Hear you in China, first class groom. - I'm so happy, Bertie. - What, what? - Happy. You're son, he looked wonderfully happy that he was getting married. - Oh, oh yes, yes. Well you'd better take our picture now instead of lurking around inside that bag. Otherwise, we'll all go off the boil. Try not to look as if this is the Battle of Ushant. (playful music) - Oh, don't you-- - (mumbles) he's taking it now. (shutter clicking) (imperious music) - [Announcer] A foggy day greets the Duke and Duchess of York as they arrive at Wembley for the final day of the British Empire Exhibition. The stadium is full to its utmost capacity and the crowd gives the duke a warm welcome as he inspects the Guard of Honor. (perky ragtime music) - Turn down the music. Your brother is about to make a fool of himself. Not to be missed. (chattering) Turn it down! (laughing) - I'm sure Bertie will do very well. - [Announcer] The royal couple have delighted everyone on their public engagements since the triumph of the wedding. Anticipation-- (static hissing) (static squealing) This truly magnificent stadium has played host to an ex-- (static hissing) Sentiments of the duke would surely echo the feelings in the hearts of many of this happy crowd. It is a long time since-- - Just wait 'til he starts to speak. You mark my words. (sighing) - [Announcer] Now here is His Royal Highness. - All of us here today for the... (stammering) British Empire Exhibition are only too aware that... (stammering) Gr... Great nations have much to learn from each other. They... (stammering) Can profit by each other's example and set the standards and courses of mutual... - He was put in splints as a child to cure his knock-knees. (chuckling) - [Bertie] Benefit. - I do believe I can hear them knocking. (laughing) - I promise you he's terribly good. He's a speech therapist. - Oh, I absolutely refuse to see some quack. The last one was insane. I stammer because it m-m... - Makes you more attractive? - I refuse to see any more quacks. (quacking) (giggling) - He won't stick pins in you. - I really draw the line at talking about potty training. - I'm sure he won't raise the subject unless you do. - Lionel Logue, sir. - Mr. Logue. - I never discuss potty training. - How do you get through the day? - What I want you to start by doing, is lying on the floor. And in case it may be treasonable to stand up while a member of the family's lying down, I'll be happy to join you. - Well, I, I think we should all lie on the floor, and just pray that no reporters have binoculars trained on the windows of Mr. Logue's consulting rooms (chuckles). - [Bertie] Now what? - Now we're on the same level. I'd like you to put your hands on your diaphragm. - Good Lord, I don't think I can find mine. (chuckling) Now what? - We breath. You do breath, do you? (giggling) - This is an original form of treatment, Mr. Logue. Do you charge people for your advice? - We breath, like this. - Good lord. Fascinating. Come on Bertie, breath, like this. - Isn't she lovely? - Mm-hm. (chuckling) - Mary. I'm hopeless with babies. I never know what comes out where. (chuckling) - Good morning, Elizabeth. How are we today? - Oh, she's been a little (mumbles). - She's caught sight of her grandfather, and she's saying to herself, "Can that old fool be King of England? "Is this possible?" (giggling) Or maybe she's caught a glimpse of her uncle. Enough to disillusion the most optimistic infant. - Do hold her. - Hm. - She's so good for you. (chuckling) Mm, mm. - David. - Congratulations to both of you on your daughter. She's quite lovely. - Thank you. - I'm sure it's what he thinks I should be doing. But I don't think I shall ever have children. The thought of him grimacing at them is enough to put one off off entirely. - Well I... - Some day, David, I suppose, well I mean in the family-- - Ah the line of succession, you mean. Why is that all that anyone ever talks about, as one is sort of a prize bull? (chuckling) (clearing throat) - She's beginning to wake. - Thank you. - (sighs) I hear you are going to address the working class in Birmingham. I trust you'll tell them that they should stop trying to run the country and leave that job to people who are more qualified to do so. - Such as yourself, presumably? - I have no pretensions of being able to run anything. But I do know a few fellows who can. I'm a very ordinary sort of chap, as are you, David. The difference between us is that you seem to be unaware of this very important fact. Don't make an ass of yourself talking to the workers. They're not as stupid as they look. - I sometimes think Father, that you have no faith in my political principles. - You think right. You have no political principles. Bertie may be defeated by three or four consonants, But at least shows some traces of character. - Dearly beloved. Shall we begin the ceremony? - [George] Yes, yes, yes. (perky bagpipe music) (chattering) - Extraordinary. (mumbling) - [Man] Well done, David. - What do you think, Thelma? - Marvelous, darling. - It's my own composition, Bertie. I'm thinking of calling it Fort Belvedere, because it was composed here in Fort Belvedere. A man must leave something of himself in this world. (laughing) - Dear me. (bagpipes moaning) - Ooh. I always think it's so clever to have the bagpipes as one's show-off. Because no one has the faintest idea whether you're playing them well or badly. (laughing) - Bravo! - Thank you. Thank you so much. You're too kind. Now, I just got sent these, from America. Apparently, they're unbreakable. Shall we see if they really are? (suspenseful music) (grunting) (gasping) (stirring music) - Right, (mumbles) right! (chattering) (laughing) - I love to see brothers who get on. (shouting) Will they always be this close, do you think? - Oh, I think so. David will become King, and become serious suddenly, like Henry V. And then Bertie will be able to look up to him even more. - And he'll put me away like Falstaff. Darling, don't look so upset. I'm married to someone else already. At least I was last time I looked. (playful energetic music) - Oh really! (laughing) (brothers shouting) - [Woman] Oh, look alive! (shouting) (laughing) - Yes! - Well, well done! - Something about father. The king is not well, again. They keep implying he might die. I really can't believe that. Can you? You know it's funny I feel absolutely nothing at all. It's a matter of entire indifference to me whether our father is well or ill. You know I really couldn't give a damn? (somber music) (laughing) You really have to go? - I'm afraid so. We have two little girls to take care of. They have to be in bed, and so do we. - Simply that my brother and his wife fear the sanctity of their family life will be corrupted if they stay any longer. - Do you see us as the good children, David? - Naturally, and Thelma and myself as terribly wicked. - Evil, David, evil. - Hello! Oh David, we're not too late, are we? - No. - David. This is Mrs. Wallis Simpson. I've asked her to look after you while I'm away. - What an intolerable burden to lay on someone, Thelma. (laughing) Goodbye, darling David. Goodbye, Thelma. - Bye. - Don't neglect us, will you? You know how Bertie loves to see you. - Goodbye, David. - Bertie. - Thelma, many thanks. (tranquil music) - Bye. - Bye. - Hm. - You know why I've called you here. This American woman, this married American woman, Mrs.-- - Simpson. - We've been hearing things. - What things? - That she stays with you at the Fort, overnight. Doubtless her husband is a loyal British subject, despite marrying an American. But I'm sure his loyalty to the crown has its limits. Your mother heard a rumor that this woman was practically selling tickets for a royal function. The queen, do you see, is worried that Mrs. Simpson might expect to be received by her. Is this relationship a clean one? - I swear to you on my honor, sir, that it is. Nothing improper has taken place between us. She's simply a wonderful woman who's company makes me very happy. - Mm... If that is your word of honor, I am prepared to ask her and her husband to the Jubilee Ball, and to Ascot. But if you are lying to me, boy, the lie will poison more things in our family than you could imagine. (tense music) - I'm telling the truth. And I don't want to be a rabbit any more. And that is where we must end. (chuckling) - Can't you finish the story? Please? - I have to go, my dears. But in case you can't be left in suspense, the boy rabbit marries the girl rabbit, and they live happily ever after. I have to meet Wallis at Emerald Cunard's at eight, or I shall be shot. - And she and Mr. Simpson are invited to Ascot, I hear. - Oh yes, that's correct. Father had heard some ridiculous rumors about our relationship. - And you told him what, exactly? - I told the king what he wanted to hear. (clock ticking) - He told Father he wasn't living with her. He lied. She aids and abets that lie. She takes care not to sign the visitor's book at the Fort. She takes money and jewels from him. (sighs) She's a... - She won't last. They never do. - This one's different. None of the others made me feel like this. (somber music) - Am I too late? - God, what on earth is he doing here? - He's here because he was a good friend of Father's, David. He's also the Archbishop of Canterbury. - Before you know it, he'll be standing on the coffin making a speech. - The king's life is moving peacefully towards its close. (sobbing) - I hadn't thought he would be so distressed. - He is frightened. (somber music) - The king is dead. (sniffing) - Long live the king. - I-I, I hope I will make good, as he made good. - It's 11:55. That's 25 past 12 by Sandringham time. - When did this ridiculous notion of keeping the clocks here half an hour fast originate? Why on earth do we do it? My father may have won his private war with the 20th century. I have no quarrel with modernity. - As your majesty pleases. - Perhaps we, we should move on to the design of the new postage stamp, David. (chuckling) - I think I should be depicted smoking a small cheroot. (chuckling softly) - Postage stamps are quite a serious business, David. - Oh God. You really are turning into father, aren't you? - Just before we move on to postage stamps, there is a question that I shall like to raise with his majesty about the order of service for his majesty's coronation next spring. His majesty has not been attending divine service or taking communion. And there have been comments, notably from the Bishop of Birmingham-- - Ha! - To that effect. - Before you start on me, dear chap, I think you should do something about that lunatic. The man's a communist. - Your majesty! - Do I appoint bishops, or do you? - [David] Margaret, Lillibet! - Daddy! - Ah! Come here! You! - They're to go to a swimming pool, I understand, a public swimming pool. We shall need more towels. - No jumping on people's heads. (girls giggling) - Jump on people's heads. - Don't care. - Don't care was made to care, - [Girls] Don't care was hung. Don't care was put in the pot and boiled 'til she was done! - I knew a little girl once who put her legs around her daddy's neck, and she died! (giggling) - (mumbles), for goodness sakes. Well you two, had better behave yourselves. Have a good swim. - Hello, darling. Simpson wishes a word. - Oh. - On behalf of the staff at Sandringham, sir, I'd like to thank you for all you've done, sir. - I understand Sam and the other groom have definitely got to go. I don't like it anymore than you do, Simpson, and I am doing what I can, but if my brother wishes it. - Indeed, sir. We are all aware of the importance of economy. Although in certain instances, his majesty has been extremely generous. I understand from Stevens, the butler at Fort Belvedere, that his majesty sent almost the entire contents of the peach greenhouse to Mrs. Simpson. (sighing) (coughing) Not my wife, you understand, but the, um, married American lady. The gardener had to be taken out in hysterics. - Thank you for telling us this, Simpson. And do give our regards to Mrs. Simpson. Your wife, not the married American lady. - You're most kind, ma'am. - This issue is becoming rather serious. Courtiers are terrible gossips. But... - I understand the American lady lectures him terribly at the dinner table. - Yes thank you, Simpson. This is all her influence. Lying isn't enough, no. Now, she has to get her knife into the servants and dismiss people who've been part of our family for years! And she prevents me from seeing him! And I, I feel I'm losing him, and I... Can't seem to... (stammering) - You're not losing him, darling! (stammering) (gasping) Bertie. You're not losing him. You won't lose him! You can't lose him! You won't let it happen! (panting) He's your brother! Give me your pulse. One, two, three, four, five. (somber music) One, two, three, four... - Who'd want to? (giggling) I would like to. (chattering) (chuckling) - Well. And you are... - Sir Samuel Hall, First Lord of the Admiralty. - Mm, were you Second Lord first? Did you work your way up? (laughing) - Frightfully amusing. Of course, the Sea Lords have never quite recovered from Nelson, have they? - Ooh, Nelson. That name is so familiar, and I don't know why. (laughing) Now, tell me, Sir Samuel, I'm only an American, and I don't understand these things. Has Hitler invaded the Rhineland? Isn't it his anyway? - Herr Hitler is a ghastly little man. - David rather likes him. Isn't he doing great things for the German railway system? - So, Mr. Simpson is not here. - I fear not, ma'am. I also understand the guest list is to be printed in the court circular. - Making it seem as if we condone the occasion. - [Man] Mrs. Simpson is invited everywhere, ma'am. - [Elizabeth] So we notice. Mr. Churchill seems to be making full use of the opportunity. - Madam, all forms of address, rhetorical, as well as geographical, are at the mercy of fashion. - Fascinating. - I told his majesty, whenever speaking in public, always arrange your notes. - [Simpson] Ooh. - Please don't concern yourself with it, ma'am. Most of us feel Winston is not much more than a second-rate wireless personality. (chuckling) - Off hands, straight back, and straight through. Let the club do the work. (whooshing) (thumping) - Oh. - See? You're not gonna make a scene at Balmoral tonight? - I don't think she'd be capable of holding up her end of it, Bertie. But we do have to make our position clear, even at the risk of alienating David. - He won't talk to me about her. You are going to make a scene. - I'm not going to be horrible to David, and he's the one we care about. - And she's the one he cares about. - You leave David to me. I'm good at elder brothers. I have hundreds of them. (thumping) Oh! (giggling) - Well, the Duchess of York displayed her justly famous charm, and all was well. (giggling) She is very Balmoral, don't you think? She really goes with the design of this place. That is if design isn't too ambitious a word for this particular interior. - I do loathe Balmoral. - Who decorated it anyway? That tartan. - Oh, it's got to go. Along with most of the staff. Hm. - [Woman] He can't get them out of kilts! (giggling) - No, no, no, we must be nice to the Duchess, though. She's a good person. Do, do be true to yourself, Bertie, and do be true to England. (giggling) David and I like to call her - David. - the Dowdy Duchess. She's incredibly-- - David! (suspenseful music) (chuckling) - Hello! - We came to dine with the king. (somber music) - Our own press have shown astonishing restraint. These are only Americans. But the implications for the Empire are ominous. Some of these may have been read by Canadians. - So far from God and so close to America. And now, I'm afraid I stopped reading newspapers when I became an object of interest to them. - They get everything wrong. David's not gonna marry this woman. Well, we've had to rather lay it on the line. But he won't cut himself off from his family! - I fear the king may do just that. I understand Mr. Simpson's divorce is set for the 27th of October. - What happens, if he insists on marrying her? - If a king goes against the advice of his ministers... (brooding music) - You mean that he might be, forced off the throne. - Sh! - Mr. Baldwin is immovable on the issue. I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news. - But this is the most wonderful woman in the world, Bertie, the most wonderful woman in the world! Baldwin is underestimating me. Now, if he thinks I will give her up, he's quite wrong! He's threatened me with my cabinet! - S-s-suppose he th-thinks it's his-his-- - I may have to go, Bertie. I may have to resign the throne. I may have to step down. - His cabinet. - What? - W-we don't want that, David. We don't want you to go. - Or there is a morganatic marriage. (phone ringing) I marry Wallis, but she doesn't attend official functions, nor is she by my side. (phone ringing) - David? - (sighs) Darling. (mumbling) It's Wallis. - W-w-would you like me to... - [Wallis] And you mustn't let yourself be bullied by Baldwin. Do not concede a single thing to him! Do you hear me? David? - She's concerned, you see, they're treating her appallingly! Yes I'm here, my darling. (tense music) Yeah. Darling, darling. We can get everything, all right. Queen, Empress of India, the whole bag of tricks. (mumbling) Yes, I know I can, darling. - [Wallis] Oh yes, you can, now-- - With you, I'm confident I can. - [Wallis] Of course, together, together we can come up with anything but-- - Bertie's here. Yeah. All right, darling. Goodbye. Well I (clearing throat)... just wanted you to know that if it comes to it, I might have to go. - "My poor Beauty," he said one day, "My good horse, you've saved "your mistress's life, Beauty, yes. "You saved her life." John told my master he never saw a horse go so fast in his life. - Can't I stay up any longer? - I'm afraid not. No, mummy and I have to... - Talk about Uncle David, I know. How can he stop being king? - Time for bed, Lillibet, run along. - Come on. - She's fast asleep. - [Nanny] Come on. There we go. - I'll be down directly. (clock ticking) (wooden clattering) I can't do this, Elizabeth! I can't step into his shoes! I sim, I simply can't I, I won't! - I'm sure it won't come to that. But we have to consider what to do if it does. (panting) - Horrible loneliness! The speeches, the people looking at your every move! (stammers) The crown, god help us! - He'll understand what you're feeling I'm sure he will and, I'm sure that when it comes to it he won't desert you! Nor the rest of his subjects! (tense forlorn music) - [Announcer] This melancholy crises is reaching its climax. All attention now focuses on the king's brother, His Royal Highness the Duke of York, the heir presumptive to the throne. (journalists chattering) We can only assume that he has been summoned here because (mumbles)... (pensive music) - Cabinet, have decided he must be absent from England for at least a year. - Are they frightened he might try and upstage you? - God alone knows. I shall create him, Duke of Windsor, a royalty (mumbles), he'll have HRH. - What about her? - I can't bear to think about her. He says he has no money. I shall give him an allowance of 25,000 pounds. He seemed pleased enough with that. It was all very civilized I suppose. - It sounds absolutely horrible. Horrible for you. - David seemed to sail through it. - And now? - Now? He abdicates. Simple as that. Mother? Maulton has drawn up this, thing. - What is it? - It's an instrument of abdication. - Has there ever been such a thing? - I think this is the first one, Mother. - You'd better read it to me Bertie. - I, Edward VIII of Great Britain, and the British dominions beyond the seas, King, Emperor of India, do hereby declare my irrevocable determination to renounce the throne, for myself and for my descendants. And, my desire that effect should be given to this instrument of abdication, immediately. - To give up all that, for a woman of no importance. - To turn his back on all of us... The greedy, thoughtless, scheming! C-Cold hearted (stammers)... (poignant music) How, how can he bow down to me as King? How can I receive his homage? How will I ever, be able to do the damn... (sobbing) (sad music) - [David] But you must believe me, when I tell you, that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties of King as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love. My brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities, is well qualified to take my place. (somber music) And he has one matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of you and not bestowed on me, a happy home with his wife and children. And now we all have a new king. I wish him and you his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all, God save the King. - So, you're King? - It rather looks as if I am. - Will we have to move? Will you not be Duke of York anymore? - I'm afraid not. - I'm first in line of succession! - So am I! - No you're not! You're second. - I'm second then. Second isn't bad really, is it? - No. Well, I suppose you'd better get on with it. (clattering) (organ music) - I raise and bless the crown, and then sir, after the blessing, you rise. - Um, I don't think I do, you, you're standing on my cloak. - Oh! Eh, what on Earth is that Rinado? Smaller Bible for knowledge. Would you excuse me a moment sir? I really think not, it's (mumbles)... - I'm terrified I'll put this thing on wrong-way around! - No darling, we had to tell them to put a little piece of red cloth to show which is the front and which is the back. - It seems to have come off. (sighing) - Golly. - Edward the Confessor's crown. The Crown of England. - I suppose it will change you. - (mumbles) kind of chap who does what he's told. You know me better than that. Sometimes I do what I'm told. And sometimes I don't. (imperious music) - And at last we catch a glimpse of the King and Queen, through the glass of the golden state coach as it passes by. We can just make out the monarch and his consort, dressed in their medieval attire. They'll spiel forth as they have done for over 300 years as a monarch approaches the abbey for his coronation. And the king now prepares to make his most reverent vows. - [Bishop] Do you solemnly promise and swear, to govern the peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zeeland and the Union of South Africa, your possessions in the other territories, to them belonging or pertaining, and of your empire of India, according to their respective laws and customs? - I solemnly promise, so to do. (stately organ music) No hesitation there. - (sighs) I can't imagine how he thought he could fill your shoes. - Or wear my crown, as the saying goes. (sighing) - Testing testing, one two, all right. - One minute 45 seconds to go. I have to say, the Battle of Jutland was infinitely preferable to this. (chuckling) - If we had recorded it sir the BBC would have been deceiving the British people. - One minute and 27 seconds. - This one's a piece of cake, I promise you. (sighing) - Mr. Logue and I have taken out all the problem areas. Only, harmless and cooperative consonants have been left in (mumbles). - Logue is a terrible man, you know he tried to get them to alter the coronation service in order to accommodate my (stammers), ridiculous inability to pronounce certain words. - Told him if he gets stuck he should yodel. (laughing) - Better go in with the queen sir. You go into the studio when the national anthem begins. That takes exactly 50 seconds and we have timed your walk into the microphone at precisely 50 seconds. - You chaps leave nothing to chance. - Shall we go then Bertie? (clicking) ("God Save The King") - Will he do it Wood? - Why are you all so down on the bloke? Give him a break can't you? Don't you think he's superb? He tries, that's what I like about him. And for a king he's a remarkably pleasant sort of person, he doesn't carry on like a royal at all! - Although it is his role to do precisely that, Mr. Logue. Or is it Dr. Logue? The music has stopped where is he? Has he run off, like his brother? - The national anthem appears to have shrunk. - It is, with a very full heart, that I speak to you tonight. Never before has a newly crowned king, been able to talk to all his peoples in their own homes, (poignant music) on the day, of his coronation. The queen and I, will always keep in our hearts the inspiration of this day. I have, in your hearing, dedicated myself with the queen at my side, in words of the deepest solemnity. We will, God helping us, faithfully discharge our trust. - [Man] We're off air now. Well done sir. (sighing) - They shouted for you! (distant shouting) They want you again! - Will I do do you think? - Oh I think you'll do very well. Do you hear what they're saying? "We want the king, we want the king!" - Well, the king wants his dinner. (chuckling) - His Royal Highness the Duke of Windsor is on the telephone sir. From Austria sir. Again sir. - I-I thought I said to tell him to call at another time, 10 tomorrow, didn't I say? - I told him that sir. - And what did David say? - He expressed incredulity ma'am, that his majesty was not available to speak to him. - What on Earth does he think Bertie does all day? Make it clear to him that he has things to do. - Being King is rather hard work. Tell him that. - On which subject sir, there are three more boxes to sign. And you have to look at these papers, the chancellor is not very happy about the 25,000 pounds you agreed to pay your brother. - Why is Mr. Chamberlain proposing David takes a job? - I think he's influenced by the fact that your brother was a little less than straight forward when he described the state of his finances. - You're telling me my brother lied to me? I have no secrets from the queen. - I'm afraid he did sir. The Duke of Windsor told you he had nothing. In fact it appears he's accumulated a fortune of around a million pounds sir, and I do not think parliament is going to look kindly on a pension of 25,000 pounds a year for him to (mumbles). - Well he, he can't have it then can he? - There was also the question of what to call, eh... - Mrs. Simpson? - Yeah, or the Duchess of Windsor as she will be, when... - David makes an honest woman of her? They're not married yet. - But they will be. And I understand your brother wants HRH for her. Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Windsor. - I do not think the king is very happy with that. Giving her HRH. Suppose this marriage doesn't last, and it very well may not. Suppose this woman, marries again? It seems to be something she makes quite a habit of doing, doesn't it? - (stammers) Does her, her new chap, Mr. Bert Bloggings then acquire royal status from her? Wouldn't it turn royal rank into a kind of contagious disease? His Royal Highness Mr. Bert Bloggings all bow down! If to be a king is to have meaning in the title itself, it must be a sacred thing, carrying with it duties and responsibilities and, and limitations of an awesome kind. And then there that is what the abdication was about, and I will not have it cheapened! Let him know that. - I'll try sir. (imperious music) (speaking foreign language) German people gave welcome to His Royal Highness the Duke, and the Duchess of Windsor, here to study Reich conditions, and to welcome the Reich Minister Robert (mumbles). He's the hideously ugly one on the left. He's a drunkard who was brought up in a Cologne brothel, now he spends his time persecuting Jews and anyone else who disagrees with him. Hardy welcome royal Britain's, to a new, prosperous Germany. - I was under the impression it was the king who made the state visits. - And the queen. Don't forget the queen. - How could he do this to Bertie? - Oh... - [Man] Oh, subtle, vile gesture. - [Elizabeth] Good god. ("Stars and Stripes Forever") - [Announcer] Here for the first time in America, a British King and Queen on a royal visit! We like the King and Queen even more after seeing them take the hurdles of our hospitality! There have been those who've said King George and Queen Elizabeth are trying to drag us into a World War. We didn't see any sign of that, just a royal couple on the friendliest of terms with our President and his First Lady. (festive ragtime music) - Thank you all so much! (mumbling) And we're off the hook! I think we both know that very soon we shall be involved, in a life or death struggle with Herr Hitler. And you, are our first line of defense. - I can't say how touched and flattered I am you asked us, and, (sighs). Munich, god... Munich was a mistake. - Yes what a pity you couldn't command Mr. Chamberlain to stay away from Herr Hitler. - I can't command, you know I can't command. I'm George VI not Henry VIII, although there are times when I wish I bloody well was Henry VIII, but I'm not. I'm a constitutional monarch, I advise, appeal, counsel, fawn, recommend, suggest, persuade, intimate, plead, wheedle, and generally crawl around on my hands and knees! - Your Majesty is a veritable thesaurus! - It's what I do. - Nobody wants a war. But if the Germans bomb London, America will come in, I think I can promise you that. - I wish my ministers would talk to me the way you do. - Oh perhaps they are restrained by the hereditary nature of your office. In which course I'm not. President to King. It's much more fun than congress. (chuckling) - Then I, I take it I have your permission to communicate your thoughts, in confidence of course, to my government. - Never write down the words of a politician, young man. Time changes all our intentions. - Of course. Read it back again my darling. - For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war. I can't believe it's happening again. I really can't. When my brother died, in the Great War, I... Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies. But it has been in vain. - (sighs) I'll say. - You'll never believe this sir. We can't find the former words we used last time we declared war on Germany. (patriotic music) - [Announcer] War has been declared! But our forces are mobilized, and ready to stand firm against the Nazi aggressor. No one wants to go down this path again, but Britain is ready to dig in for the fight. And our children steadfastly play their part on the road to victory. Godspeed, and you'll soon be back home. - Mr. Churchill. I'm sorry to see that Mr. Chamberlain has lost the confidence of the house. - These are difficult times sir. The Nazi invasion of Holland and the low countries, which commenced at three a.m. this morning on a broad front, proceeding with a ruthless brutality already witnessed in Czechoslovakia and Poland. - Indeed, I read the papers. (sighing) I suppose you don't know why I have sent for you. - Sir, I simply couldn't imagine why. - I want you to form a government. - I will most certainly do so, if you ask me sir. - Preferably without Lord Beaverbrook. Nothing to do with his support for Wallace. And, as your sovereign, I'm well aware that my function is only to advise to counsel into war. - Indeed sir. - So, I'm advising you. - Thank you sir. I take what you say with great seriousness. May I say that all who serve you bear a tremendous debt of gratitude for your high sense of duty to your family, and the manner in which you've shouldered the immense burden you've undertaken. - The immense burden in this case being you. (chuckling) The Beaver is still making trouble with David. But you're going to hire him anyway, aren't you? - I'd rather have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent, pissing in sir. (chuckling) (telephone ringing) - Royal Page's Office Buckingham Palace. Who is speaking please? I'm sorry this line isn't very good, you are... You are the Queen of the Netherlands, right, I'm sure you are, now look, it's five a.m. in the morning I'm not in the mood... You are the Queen of the Netherlands. I must apologize mum. Right. Right. I'll go and get him mum! (footsteps echoing) (knocking) Sir! - What is it? - Sir we have the Queen of the Netherlands on the telephone sir, she says it's urgent! - Oh I'll be right with you! (door clattering) What did she want? - She wants you to send some aircraft sir, for the defense of Holland. She sounds in some distress sir! - Have we got any aircraft to spare? - Isn't that your department rather than mine? (telephone ringing) - Simpson! I'll get it. Yes? Oh hello again, what news? (sighing) She got on board a British destroyer? Well, if it's been ordered back to England I can't very well order it back to Holland now can't I? It's Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, she seems to be at (mumbles). Rather looks as if you'd better come and stay with us. Oh. She hasn't got any luggage. She hasn't got anything to wear. Doesn't even have a hat. - We'll buy her a hat. - You can get a train from there to Liverpool Street, I'll come down and pick you up. Yes, yes, yes do that, goodbye! She isn't very happy about it. She feels she should be with her people. - She's absolutely right Bertie. But if she were to be captured I fear the Germans would make capital out of it. - So where would you propose to go if you were going to be captured? - You're not supposed to go anywhere, you're not supposed to be captured. As monarchs we are symbols, never more so than in time of war. Which is why the children must stay here. Someone had the absurd notion of sending them to Canada. Never heard anything so ridiculous in my life! - You like my new hat? Oh it's a good hat no (chuckles)? Where are the little princesses? - We've sent them to Windsor but they're not leaving the country. Your hat is superb. - I am interested to see the palace defenses. - Oh of course-- - You know, the Germans sent parachutists in to try to capture my person for propaganda purposes? They failed (chuckles)! - Apparently, I just press some uh, one of these buttons here, and men leap out of the shrubbery. Well, eventually. (chuckling) (gun firing) - Oh! - (mumbles), I do not intend to be captured alive! - Oh, fingers! (gun firing) - You know I nearly clipped Lord Halifax the other day. (chuckling) - Oh darling! - Bertie! You are the only man I've yet encountered whose temper was improved by the fall of France! - Oh, we're much better on our own, without all those foreigners to worry about? - Really? - Present, company accepted of course. (chuckling) No, Britain will muddle through, you'll see. Going to shoot again? - Oh! (mumbling) - Ears! (gun firing) (chuckling) - There you are, if there's a German parachutist around he's in for a nasty shock. - But they will come my dears. And when they do, it is frightening. (forlorn music) - [Announcer] London and our great cities have shown steadfast courage in the face of shelling and incendiaries. Each dawn brings fresh stories of heroism and miraculous escapes. According to Goebbels, the people's moral is broken. Well, just look at them! - [Elizabeth] Thank you. - They've gone quiet. Uh, we lost 34 planes, the Nazi's lost 182. 53 almost certainly destroyed! We're not dead yet! (chuckling) - You know I think our friends are losing the taste with daylight raids, the tend not to come back in one piece. - But it's a funny kind of quiet. - [Elizabeth] Hmm... - Is that something? - Is that an airplane do you think? - Just so long as it's one of ours! - Don't think it is sir. It's a bloody hun coming in over the Mall! - Utterly infernal! (dramatic music) (airplane droning) - Run! - [Bertie] Quick darling, quick! - [Elizabeth] Run Tommy! - Hold on! (explosion booming) (Elizabeth screaming) (glass breaking) Hold tight! (sirens howling) (mumbling) (explosions booming) (dramatic music) Quick, quick! (explosion booming) (crashing) In here! Run Tommy! - Are you all right? - It's a direct attack on the palace all right! Some pilot, knew his way around! - (stammers) I do have a relative in the German Air Force, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg's boy, he came to father's funeral, wasn't he? - Maybe David gave him a ground plan. (chuckling) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) - Damn close thing! We could all have been killed! (resolute music) - How do I look? - Dressed for a garden party. (chuckling) - It was Hutton's idea, keep 'em smiling, bright colors. (cheering) (imperious music) Britain can take it. (applauding) (cheering) Thank you. (mumbling) - Blessings. - Thank you, thank you. (camera clacking) Shall we? (mumbling) Morning, morning, morning... - Good morning. Your house still standing? Awful sight! - [Elizabeth] Good morning, good morning! (mumbling) - Good morning. - Thank god for a good king! - Here here! (cheering) - Th-Thank god for a good people! (applauding) - We heard you was bombed! - You can say for that. - Are you're all right then. - I seem to be all here young man (chuckles)! Now look, we have here! Aww... (melancholy music) You do (mumbles). - Thank you. - You do (mumbles), god bless you! Listen now I have to go now, bye bye. Bye bye, bye bye! (chattering) Thank you! (cheering) - You put on your best clothes then didn't you? - Well you'd put on your best clothes if you came to see me wouldn't you? (chuckling) (applauding) - Three cheers for Her Majesty the Queen! Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! (camera clacking) - They talk about moral, all these people have lost their homes, look at them. - I think they're wonderful! (sighing) - My dear President Roosevelt. It is some time since I last wrote to you. - And you still haven't received a reply any more than have I. I only wrote to his wife. I failed to see how politeness would have compromised her. - Politics. - Oh you know I wish you wouldn't work so hard. Drink so much or smoke so much or-- - Care so much? (sighing) - You must do what you have to do my darling but I am allowed to worry about you. - If only he'd answer. We're on the edge of losing the whole damn shoot. - You know I sometimes wonder whether the endless waving and grinning at everyone and everyone might be of use to this country is really any good whatsoever. The only thing the American president will understand is a large bomb personally delivered to the White House lawn by Adolph himself. Or one of his friends. (explosion booming) - [Roosevelt] Yesterday, December 7, 1941, a date that will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked, (poignant music) by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. (imperious music) - With America now on our side, each day sees more and more of their gallant troops arriving on our shores! So we say, welcome boys, glad to have you on board! - Someone has painted a black line around the bath. Now why would they do that? - It's to show how much water you're allowed. - Good lord! And how much are you allowed? - Up to the line. - Well a reasonably substantial person would hardly be covered at all! (chuckling) I shudder to think what your grandfather would have made of it. (sighing) I suppose we must do these things. We've been advised in the country to give lifts to servicemen. I picked up an American, he was delightful. But I don't believe he knew who I was. (cork popping) - Thank you. - Fishcakes ma'am. I'm told they're most nutritious. - They remind me of something I think I'd rather forget. Now, now I rather wish they'd been what they looked like. Rather than what they actually are. (chuckling) Fishcakes. - Well I think there is some cold ham, somewhere. Is there cold ham, Simpson? - I'm assured a small quantity of ham may be available ma'am. - I can't stop for ham. (thumping) In fact I can't stop for fishcakes. Got to work, sorry, no stop at all. Work! - Bertie's been working so hard. - Hmm, he is. You can't stop them, you want to stop them but you can't stop them, and you must not stop them. It's their duty. - Yes. - I'll have a word with him after dinner. (serene music) Working then? - Yes mother. - Late? Well after midnight. Almost one. - Yes Mother. - Well, must be done. (resolute music) - Now. (courageous music) - [Announcer] In North Africa the war continues. Under their leader, General Bernard Montgomery, the British Eighth Army soundly defeated Rommel and his men, capturing 30,000 prisoners, 350 tanks, and 400 guns. (footsteps echoing) (courageous music) - It's General Montgomery! - Is he the El Alamein one? - He is, do you know what they say about him? He's the greatest commander since Nelson! His men love him! - Sir this is the most tremendous honor. - Congratulations. - Frightfully pleased to see you general. - Would you like me to inspect your daughter ma'am? (chuckling) - Oh yes later, I think absolutely. - Tell us how you did it! Rommel was supposed to be unbeatable wasn't he? - Ah, well, may I use the cup here now? - Feel free. - So, we were here, hmm? They were there, and then I moved around here. Then we snogged at 'em for a couple of hours, we came 'round here, after which we had a most witty party! Biff, bang, bang 100% binge, lots of chaps being killed. - I have only one criticism. Are you sure about the hat? - Oh, (chuckles) my beret, is tremendous (mumbles), the Eighth Army depends upon by beret sir! (chuckling) Anyway, after that, I had them penned in, you see, and then I forced him towards the sea, like so. - Alan Brooke told us he was worried you were after his job. - I'm worried you're after mine! (chuckling) - I'm just a simple soldier sir. Anyway, after we totally surrounded their army, I have a dog called Rommel by the way, (chuckling) I smashed him, (clattering) like so! (chuckling) Thousands of men died. Good brave men, (sighs), eh Tommy? I'm their (mumbles). (imperious music) - [Announcer] VE Day, we've been waiting for this for six years, and now London celebrates! From Piccadilly Circus to Trafalgar Square, and right down the Mall, they'll sing and cheer! But the biggest crowds are (cheering) outside Buckingham Palace, where the king and queen and princesses share the celebrations with Mr. Churchill! (patriotic singing) (cheering) - Today we give thanks to Almighty God for a great deliverance. Speaking from our empire's oldest capital city, war battered but never for one moment daunted or dismayed... - Is daddy all right? - He's not well. - Speaking from London, - He's very tired. He's been working - I ask you - very very hard. - to join with me, in an act of thanks giving. (poignant music) Germany, the enemy who drove all Europe into war, has been finally overcome. - Ah here he comes. Your new Prime Minister. - Will I ever get used to Mr. Attlee? - The Labor Party did. (chuckling) - Poor old Winston. When the world no longer makes sense, it means you're getting old. - When your children start to get married. You're unable to read small print. They give you a state funeral. (chuckling) You know Phillip will need to get your permission before he marries your best girl. - No father likes to lose his daughter. She is really very young you know. - Yes she is. Though certain people are very keen that it should happen you know? - Indeed, I noticed something of the kind. - Dickie (mumbles) went down on one knee on his bath. - It seems unbelievable, only yesterday she was my little girl, and now, now somebody wants to take her away from us. And here's Mr. Attlee who in some ways has a similar agenda. - I suppose we'd better let him in. - He comes at my invitation. - Good luck. - Well. - Well. - Did you know... - Sir? - I still have that pipe, the one you like. - Is that so? - With the self cleaning device! - Good lord, and the bowl on the same level? - Yes exactly. Now... It seems you want to nationalize everything. - Yes sir. - And the gas employees are on strike. - Indeed sir. - You and I could easily go on strike. You could send me no papers. And if you did I could refuse to sign them. But we don't do we? - No, sir. - The king must open a hospital. The king must open a hospital, although there are times when he'd rather be in one. - All right. - A better looking (mumbles). - They want, we queue, but however long the queue is we keep smiling don't we? - I think it might be quite fun! And you're not to say you'd rather be in a hospital! Hospitals are awful places, people die in them. Kings have to go on forever and ever. - But if they don't, they have princesses to replace them. (applauding) (cheering) - Thank you so much! - Marvelous. (mumbling) Bye. - You're not waving. - My arm hurts. - I'm waving. I'm doing extra waving, I'm doing at least two waves to a second! This way it's actually done, (mumbles)! (chuckling) You see that man over there with the glasses? This is for him! (cheering) (applauding) - I don't think I quite understand the National Health Service. - It's quite simple, it's so that people who don't have the money don't have to pay for treatments and medicines. - So if a chap wants a pair of false teeth, they just give it to him? (chuckling) And uh, free shoes, huh? - Wave! Look cheerful! Think about free spectacles! I've seen the bright side of the transport and general worker's union. Wave! - It is with the greatest pleasure, that the king and queen announce the betrothal of their dearly beloved daughter, Princess Elizabeth, to Leftenant Philip Mountbatten, son of the late Prince Andrew of Greece. - Not Prince Andrew Schletwig, Holstein Zondeburg Gluksberk? (chuckling) - No sir. - Just of Greece. - Yes (mumbles). - Good. - To this union, the king has gladly given his consent. - After we forced him to the floor and beat him about the head with the leg of a chair. (chuckling) (coughing) Are you all right? - Oh I'll be fine. - Oh you lost weight on that South African tour. (coughing) - Yeah all that waving... - [Elizabeth] People will think him amazingly generous. - [Bertie] King of Swaziland, how exquisite. - Ooh what on Earth is this? Is this one of your wedding presents? - Nylon stockings. I've been given 237 pairs. - No no this! - It's a gift from Mahatma Gandhi. - Oh it's absolutely disgusting. It's his loin cloth or whatever it is he wears. - It's a piece of cloth he wove on his own spinning wheel, at Uncle Dickie's suggestion. Gandhi is a remarkable man. - I don't care what he is, his loin cloth is disgusting! - And we're not asking David. He didn't do too badly in the Bahamas. He didn't start any wars or anything, mind you he came pretty close to it. I was thinking, maybe we should have asked him. It wouldn't be the end of the world if we asked him. - And if he wanted to bring her? She'd never be received. - Well... Just, I feel a little sorry for him, living in Paris with nothing to do and-- - House the size of the British Embassy, and dining in style each night. It wouldn't make sense of the past. We have done what we have done, and we must stand by it. (poignant music) - My darling Lillibet. I was so proud of you and thrilled at having you so close to me on our long walk in Westminster Abbey. But when I handed you to the archbishop I knew I had lost something very precious. I am so glad you went and told mummy that you think the long wait before your engagement was for the best. I was rather afraid you had thought I was being hard hearted about it. Our family, us four, the royal family must remain together with additions of course at suitable moments. I have watched you grow up all these years with pride under the skillful direction of mummy who as you know, is the most marvelous person in the world in my eyes. (laughing) (door clattering) - [David] Thanks. - Well, we meet again. - Eventually. Your time seems fully occupied, yes. You don't look well. - Well, as you may remember, the role of king is an onerous one. - Really? I never found it so. - Perhaps because you never bothered to carry out many of its duties. - Such as marrying a woman who is acceptable to Mr. Baldwin, I must say that uh, I never thought that romance was something that could be dictated to one by politicians. - Or stayed in the job long enough to be qualified to talk about it. - You know what I've come to ask. - To ask us to recognize your wife. And I think you know what my answer will be. - Oh you have grown so hard, Bertie, hard the way they are hard, you've been chanting their lines so long you've come to believe you wrote them. - I don't think you ever really understood what you did when you walked away from the throne of England. Or, what our position would have to be when you did so. What do you do in Paris, David? What have you done since the Bahamas? - I have tried to work for my country and been blocked by you. No that's not right, I've been blocked by your wife and my mother. A couple of ice-veined bitches. - Can I explain this again? You and I are not as other men. Our lives are circumscribed by the office we've both been born, an office, whose existence is at the very heart of what English democracy and English liberty means! We are at the service of our people and our parliament, not the other way around! And if, the cabinet and the dominions of this great nation of ours should choose to tell you you may not marry Mrs. Simpson, who are we to oppose them? - Who's to say who's suitable to be a queen? Is divorce a disqualification? Have we not see royal divorce, and will we not see more? Or are Americans somehow naturally evil? Oh admit it Bertie. The issue is Wallis, and the fact that that, common little wife of yours disliked her. - If you have any inkling of what it is that my wife (stammers) means, what it is that she means to me, what it is that, love, and duty, (stammers) duty, and love, what they mean and you... You... - Feeling better are we? - The interview is over. (Bertie coughing) (door clattering) - The uh, bulletin issued on the 18th, ma'am. It reads, during the king's recent illness a series of examinations was carried out, including radiology and recos-kopy. These investigations now show, structural changes to the lung. - You mean not to say that the tumor's malignant? Or to let him know that? - No ma'am. - I would like a frank and honest assessment of how long you think His Majesty's likely to live. A guess then, you'll be hung, drawn and quartered if you get it wrong. (forlorn music) How long has he got? How long have I got with him? - Sir? (sorrowful music) (stately music) - [Elizabeth Voiceover] It is very difficult to realize the king has left us. He was so much better, and so full of plans for the future. He was so young to die, and was becoming so wise in kingship. As our daughter takes up his task, it is impossible to tell what duties and difficulties lie in wait for the future of this, our ancient English monarchy. But it is impossible to deny, that by his example of courage, modesty, and decency, George VI leaves her a throne more securely established than at any time in this dark and divided century. - [Tommy] The Duke of Windsor, will be attending the funeral. - Indeed. - Our understanding is that the duchess, will not be in attendance. - No. Don't let me keep you Tommy. You have things to do. (poignant music) (pleasant music)
