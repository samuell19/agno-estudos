We should've talked at the boatyard. You don't wanna talk about it here. I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack. How much do you know? Not much. The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago. The second one in Atlanta was all over TV. Did you ever think about giving me a call? - No. - Why not? I quit. Remember? You look all right now. I am... all right. If you can't look anymore, I understand. Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack. If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask. This guy's on a lunar cycle. I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon. We have a better chance to get him fast... if you help. I'll think about it. Stay and eat. Hi, Molly. - Think it'll keep them out, Dad? - Yep. How many turtle eggs think are in here? Huh? In this hatchery? I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them. Crabs get most of the newborns, huh? Yeah, but not now. These are all gonna make it, guaranteed. What about the dogs? - Are they gonna get in here? - No, they can't dig under. You see, that's why we bury the wire down in the sand. We need more staples, pal. You're supposed to be his friend, Jack. Why didn't you leave him alone? If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can. We got it pretty good, don't we? We have it more than good. All that happened to you before lets you know that. If I went back, I'd only look at evidence. I wouldn't get deeply involved. He'd never even see me or know my name. If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me. Whatcha think? I think you've already decided and you're not really asking. If I were asking? Stay here with me, me and Kevin. But it's selfish, and I know it. Come here. I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around. Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but... That's right. There's a... VCR hooked up in your hotel room. They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS. Thanks. Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup. His entry was skillful. All the prints are smooth gloves. Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint. Blood AD positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup. Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass? It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him. Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds. Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation. Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot. All her other injuries were post-mortem. Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray. Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room. Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained, as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem. What'd the killer do with them after they were dead? Hi, this is Valerie Leeds. Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message, please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later. What the? What'd he do in the interval? The smeared bloodstains on the west wall... uh... - Hello? - Molly? - Will, is that you? - Yeah, it's me, honey. Look, I'll call you tomorrow. Go back to sleep. I love you. I love you too, baby. What are you dreaming? That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it? God, she's lovely, isn't she? It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it? They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom. The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her. You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you? Didn't you, you son of a bitch? You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on. But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see ya? Hello? Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints? Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now. What do you got, Will? Get him to Atlanta. Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good. He is good. He's not as good as Price. I'll get him on a plane in the morning. What do you want him to do? Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time. They dusted everything. Your report didn't mention eyes. Why do you think he took his gloves off? Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman. All right, all right. Settle down, now. Sit down, please. After-house interviews will he extended an additional four blocks. RNI's loaned us a couple of clerks to cross-match the airline reservations between Birmingham last month and Atlanta now. Dr. Princi. This is what the subject's teeth looked like. The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month. As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here. All right. Investigator Graham, you've worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything? Could you come up to the front? I don't think he's a drifter, acting upon victims of opportunity. Skillful entry indicates premeditation and planning. Therefore, I believe he's an organized individual who probably lives life competently with little or no leakage. Meaning in appearance he could be absolutely anyone? That's right. Bodies being arranged into an audience and the mirrors make me believe that there's a rich and intense fantasy life going on here. The elevated experience is the fantasy. The act fuels the fantasy. To discover what he thinks he's doing in there, why he picked who he picked, did what he did, to understand his motive, you have to know his illusions, his dreams. Which are? I don't know. What else do you have for us? That's all I have. All right. Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral. The rest of your assignments are on the sheet. Let's go. Oh, well, one more thing. I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy. Yeah. Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda. That's it. I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money. I know his motive, so I go to work on fences. This guy, we don't even have motive. None of us have shit, and we know it. It's in his dreams. - His motive? - Yeah. The commissioner was saying that you're the one who, uh, got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago. Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he? Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. What happened to them? One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver. What the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor? The psychologists call him a psychopath. They don't know what else to call him. I understand he cut you pretty good. What about the dog? It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they? That's right. We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat. Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the backyard. Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. Yeah? This is Jimmy Price, FBI. - Let me put you on speakerphone. - Who am I talking to? Uh, Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford. You got Will Graham here, too. I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb. And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-hall hemorrhage from the gunshot wound. Can we make an identification off of it? Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon. Thanks, Jimmy. No... no comment. If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed. - Hey, Will Graham! - If not, I don't know. Whadda ya hear? Whadda ya say? You remember me? Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback. So, come on, Will, when did they call you in? What do you got? Hey, look, I'm buying lunch, all right? Hey, Lounds, why don't you give it a rest? Hey, he's news. I'm doing my job. So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor? Huh? What does he do to 'em? How's he do 'em? How's he do 'em, Will? Keep the fuck away from me. Will, Will. The son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor. He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures. Yeah, I know. Look, don't expect too much from me, all right? We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot. What, you think I'm gonna see him standing in the street, and say, "There he is"? That's Houdini you're thinking about. The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or we get lucky. - He won't stop. - Why? He's got a genuine taste for it. You do know something about him. Not enough. Think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow. Why? Recover the mindset. - Yeah? - Hey, hotshot. - You doing some good? - Nothing you'd notice. - I miss ya. - Me too. I miss my husband. What's going on? Day-to-day is boring. Tell me what you're doing. I'm eatin' room service. They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough physical evidence, or else I haven't done enough with it yet. Were you gonna be in Atlanta long? I mean, you know, I'm not hugging you about coming home, but I was just wondering. I don't know. I gotta go to Baltimore tomorrow. To do what? Uh, I got to see somebody. I was thinking about, um, painting the kitchen. What color do you like? Will, are you there? Uh, I don't know, paint it... Let's paint it yellow. Yellow's kind of a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast. - Blue, then. - I don't know about blue. Look, paint the damn room battleship grey, what do I care? I'm sorry. Look, when I get back, we'll go to the paint store together, and we'll get some chips, and we'll figure out... Look, Will, I don't know why I'm talking trivia. I called to tell you that I love you and I miss you. And I'm... You're doing the right thing. And it's costing you, too, I know that. I'm here. I'm right here, and I'll be here whenever you come home. I'll meet you if you need me to... Anywhere. Anytime. That's what I called to tell you. Molly... I love you. Goodnight. That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago. Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas. Did you get my card? I got it. Thank you. And how is Officer Stewart? The one who was first to see my basement. Stewart's fine. Emotional problems, I hear. Do you have any problems, Will? No. No, of course you don't. I'm glad you came. My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere. Second-raters, the lot. Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction In the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. - And? - Very interesting. - Even to a layman. - Layman? A layman? An interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say, you're a layman? But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? - Do you know how you did it? - What does it matter now? It doesn't matter to me, Will. I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor. Yes, I thought so. It's about Atlanta and Birmingham. Yes? - You read about it? - In the papers. I don't tear out the articles. I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you? - I thought you might have some ideas. - Why should I tell you? You'd get to see the file on this case. - And there's another reason. - Pray tell. Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for. Then, by implication, you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me. No. I know that I'm not smarter than you. - Then how did you catch me, Will? - You had disadvantages. What disadvantages? You're insane. You are very tan, Will. Your hands are rough. They don't look like cop's hands anymore. And that shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it? Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity. I don't think I'll persuade you at all. You'll either do it or you won't. Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best. - Do you have the file with you? - Yes. - Pictures? - Yes. Let me have them, and I might consider it. No. Dream much, Will? Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You haven't threatened to take away my books yet. Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think. This is a very shy boy, Will. What were their yards like? Big back yards. Fences, hedges. Why? Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it. Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will? Appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing. That's interesting. No, it's not. You thought of it before. I considered it. You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you? I want your opinion. I don't have one right now. Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it. - Can I keep this? - I haven't decided yet. I'll study them. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to leave me your home phone number? No. Do you know how you caught me, Will? Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file. Do you know how you caught me? The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike. Do you understand? Smell yourself. Gotcha. 217 now hoarding at Gate 12. Eastern Airlines, Flight 217 is now ready for boarding at Gate 12. Get up against the bunk and face the wall. Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you in the face. Thank you so much. I'll call you when I'm finished. Are you ready for your call? Yes, thank you. Paltrow, Christiansen & Golub, Law Offices. Excuse me. I must have misdialed. Thank you for using AT&T. This is Operator 24. Operator, I don't have the use of my arms. Would you be so kind as to, uh... dial a number for me, please? Certainly. What's the number? Area code 301, 555-6624. The University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Sidney Bloom, please. He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office. What's his secretary's name again? Uh, Martha King. Just a moment, please. - Martha King's desk. - Hi, Martha. Martha doesn't come in nights. Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards publishing company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone. Martha never sent me the address and phone number. She'll be in in the morning. Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me. I don't see a Rolodex. I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone. - Yeah... - Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G. All right. The name we're looking for, the last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.. Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too. 3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida. Thank you... so very much. I've finished. - Mom! - Oh, my gosh. It's all right. Stewardess! Ladies and gentlemen, We are beginning our descent into Birmingham. Yeah, this couple come down from Duluth. We was talking them down the short-term mortgages. And I'm figuring, "Gee, Andy, you're gonna unload this turkey." Well, and a squad car rolls up, and they start asking questions. Then the good old boys give 'em the whole grand tour... Who was lying where, and what. Terrific. So, they get in their Sedan DeVille and get the hell out of here. Any single men ask to see the house? Haven't asked me. You used a cutting tool on the branch, so that you could see. Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming. When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows. Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one. Then, after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't ya? Didn't you, you son of a bitch? You watched them all goddamned day long! That's why houses with big yards. I need the Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used. And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. - Is it weird? - The mark? Yeah. If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley. Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print? No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet. It's a hand search. He's got half his department on it. Listen Will, have you seen this week's Tattler? It's not on my preferred reading list, Jack. Yeah, well, uh, your picture's all over the front page. Who the hell was it? Lounds? Of course. Who else? God damn it, Jack! I promised Molly! I promised her! Come in. - Dr. Chilton? - Yes? When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book. We got him out of there and dug around. - Is that it? - Yes. Put it down on my desk, Bonner. Has anyone else seen this except you? No. Special Agent Crawford's office. This is Dr. Chilton. I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away. He's not here, he's in Birmingham. Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now. Will you please tell them this is very, very urgent. I'll hold on. Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford. You have Will Graham on the line, too. I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta. Dr. Chilton, where did you get it? In Hannibal Lecktor's cell. It was hidden in a book. Dr. Chilton, don't touch the note. Can you read it to us? It's written on toilet tissue. "My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming. You alone know the people I use to help me in these things are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming, just as the source of light is burning. I have a collection of your press clippings. I think they are absurd, as are mine. 'The Tooth Fairy, ' what could be more inappropriate? Investigator Graham interests me, very purposeful-looking. I hope we can correspond." Mr. Graham, there's a piece missing here. Now I'll read the bottom part. "After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet." Signed "Avid Fan". It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom. Sarah, order a chopper, next thing smoking. I don't care whose it is. Two, call Alabama Air National Guard and tell 'em to get Graham back here right now. Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving five minutes ago. You understand? I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note. Listen, after we've worked the note, I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it. He might try to warn the killer somehow. - Where's Lecktor now? - Holding cell. How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious? Three, four hours. Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority. It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints, and then Documents. Will Graham and I will be walking it through. One hair, Graham. Maybe half an inch. - And a couple of blue grains. - Work the hair. Do we have the negative comparison? Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use. This is, uh, hair from the security guard. How many guys handled this without gloves? The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor. The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers. But the others... One smudge. Those aren't ridges. It's just the texture of the paper. I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out. - Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat? - No. We couldn't wash it after. I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will. - How long do I have? - Twenty minutes, max. The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him? Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says, "I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap. This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away. You're so sly, but so am I. The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't. This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here. At the end is what could be the top of an R. There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler". We know our boy reads it. The article about me and Lecktor. I don't know anybody else that's carried that. Personal ads. We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler. The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads. We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor. If we find Lecktor's reply, we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own. And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read. Bill? "Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage. Ticket number 72663." It's a Secret Service letter drop. We plan to stake it out. When he shows, we'll grab him. Anything from Chicago? - Not yet. - When do they go to press? Thirty-five minutes. - Christ. - Let's get to the physical. There was no print. Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'. That note was written by your man. Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end. The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man. Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type. This is Chester. Who am I talking to? Will Graham, Jack Crawford. Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now. - Read it. - "Dear Avid Fan, You honor me. You're very beautiful." Oh, Christ. "I offer 100 prayers for your safety. Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2, Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7, Jonah 6:8, John 6:22, Luke 1:7." Thanks. Jimmy, did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints? Not yet. Photography at Langley? They got shot a telex. They're on it now. No. And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him. Book code? "100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter. But what book? - Not the Bible? - No. Galatians 15:2. Galatians only has six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8. Jonah only has four chapters. Lecktor was not using the Bible. Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. Right. What about sweating Lecktor? They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. Gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. Wonderful. The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to. He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor. Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place. Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books. - Where? - Library of Congress. Twenty-five minutes. He won't make it in time. Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later. Or... we pull it, figure out the code, and run our own ad next week. And lose a week? We got 17 days till the next full moon. And I don't like Lecktor's ad runnin' without knowing what it says. It's your call, Will. Run it. And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write? We'll all feel sick for a very long time. And if Bowman still can't figure it out? Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler. What, for instance? Me. I don't think that's a very good idea. Why not? Don't you think we can provoke him? Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked. What I was thinking about is you. You're getting deeper and deeper into this. Good night. Sidney. I'll talk to you, Will. Okay? Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape. You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend. Sidney, don't worry about me. I'm working the evidence, making moves. That's all. I'm fine. Bowman just struck out. - It is not books in Lecktor's cell. - Price? He just heard. It's a bust-out. As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy. But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index. We are not gonna identify him off the print. I'll use Lounds. What for? Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the Tattler. What else should we cover? He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay. He's molested all of his male victims. He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex. Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother. So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington? Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy. Can the Tattler rely on gettin' the straight stuff from you? Absolutely. How does working on this case affect your sex life? Mine? It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours. Go fuck yourself. - Look, pal of mine, you're news. - Shoot the pictures. All right, Stimy, let's shoot 'em. I'm in the shots with Graham. - What? - I'm in the shots with you. Come on, you want this to look real or not? Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus. We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious. You make sure that I look excellent. All right, shoot it. One more. - One more. - That's enough. Okay, Graham. Hey, always nice, huh? Let's have lunch, call my service. Crawford, always a thrill. Dr. Bloom. I need them on my desk in two hours. Okay? - Did Bowman break the code yet? - No. Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter. I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley. - The mark you found on the tree? - Yeah? It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling. That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece. It means "Red Dragon". Mean anything to you? No. I'm having the bureau fly Molly up tonight. Huh? Well, she said she can get away for one night. I do something wrong? No, it's just the setting, Jack. - Hm. - Thanks. If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind. - How's your hearing? - It's good. You'll wear a wire, one-way. We'll hear you, you won't hear us. You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog? Yeah. Load these in it. You ever fire 'em? - Glaser Safety Slugs. - Yeah. Number 12 shots. Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Guaranteed one-shot stop. - You got body armor? - Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance. I hope you get one. 'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight out of eleven times? Let's walk the route. United Flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at Gate 7. United Flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at Gate 7. You didn't cancel the food. So, where are things? We got nine days left. We're working on it, doing stuff. You don't want to talk about what you're doing, do you? Hotel rooms... Illicit romance. We have to stop meeting like this. Remember the first time we met? Yeah. When we were alone together in that room. Even though I'd never seen you before, we were sitting there, speaking. And something flickered across your face like a shadow. I said, "What's that?" Mm-hmm. Remember what you said? I said, "This is too good to live." Time is luck, Will. I know the value of every single day. Someone's coming. Go! Don't! Don't move! Take the money! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Clear! - Clear! What you moving in slow motion for, man? I'm being mugged! For real. Can you believe that? Pay up. ...in sports, the Cubs lost again. Hey! You know who I am? Mm-hm. I don't want to know who you are. According to you, I'm a sexual pervert. "An animal," you said. You know who I am now? Yes. Do you feel privileged? I'm very scared. Open your eyes. Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter. Your job is to report. That's why you're here. And if you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead. Well... here I... am. Look at the screen. William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun. - Do you see? - Yes. Mrs. Leeds. Do you see? Yes. Mrs. Jacobi. Do you see? Yes. The next family as they will look when I go to visit them. - Do you see? - Yes. Freddie Lounds, your photograph. - No. - No, what? No. Not me, please. - Please. - Are you a man? Yes. Do you imply that I'm queer? God, no. Before me, you are a slug in the sun. You are privy to a great... becoming, and you recognize nothing. You are an ant in the afterbirth. It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble. But fear is not what you owe me. No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe. We have one more piece of work to do. If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man. Open your eyes. - Open your eyes! - Ah. You will read this... in the tape recorder. Go. "I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him were lies. Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia. Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie. He will be more merciful to me than to you. You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do. I will be a testament to the truth of this." You did very well. Will you let me go now? Please? You will tell the truth? I promise. Good. We'll seal your promise with... We'll seal your promise... ...with a kiss. We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking. Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity to answer that very same question. The team with the most points at the end of three rounds will compete and win... ...will also compete in the right to enter Diamondhead in our fourth and final round. Uh, questions in Round number one are gonna be worth 10 points each. Okay, that means the round is all over. So, Jane we're all ready. Help us with Round One. All right, Bob, the first category today is the Far East. And the choices are Vietnam, Japan, Laos, Thailand, and China. Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay? - Did he try to say anything at all? - No, he sure didn't. He never regained consciousness. - Did you hear the tape? - Yeah. Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad. It was the State of Maryland statutes. You need to know what it said right now. - What? - Listen to me. Everything is okay. I've taken care of it. What is it, Jack? The bastard gave him your home address. It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all." - Get me a plane. - Will! Will. Will. Mom. Huh? What time... What? S-someone's outside. They're noises. - Where? - Outside. Mom... Go back to your room and close the door. - Mom... - Do it, now. Ma'am, are you all right? What? What is it? What is it? What's going on? Ma'am, I think you should come back inside. - What's going on? - Come back inside. Please. I think you should come back inside. I'm sorry, Molly. I'm sorry about all of this. This place is fine. We'll be fine. He's after you now, isn't he? It's just a precaution. Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock? I want to hang around here. - I'm in the kitchen, Mom. - Okay. What is that about? What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now? He saw the article in the Tattler, right? I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face. Good for him. Kevin, come on, help me unpack, will ya? Then we'll go get some groceries. You and Mom are very well-protected, you know. No one's gonna find out where you are. Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? No. This guy is trying to kill us? We don't know that. When are you going to kill him? I'm not. It's only my job to find him. Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you were in a special hospital. Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing. That bothers you, doesn't it? I don't know. Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor? Mm-hm. What happened? Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them. How? In bad ways. He was a psychiatrist. One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her. I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him. When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf. It had pictures of war wounds in it. And I knew it was him. So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police, and that's when he attacked me. You and Mom, came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot. But after my body got okay, I still had his thoughts going around in my head. And I stopped talking to people. And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help. And I did. Then after a while, I felt better, and I was okay again. And the way he thought felt that bad? Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world. So, what kind of coffee do you like? Huh? You like that Folgers stuff, right? Yeah. Mom likes that, too. When can we go home, Dad? I don't know, Kevin. So, where are things? Nowhere. Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired. Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so that we get it fresh. We've got about six more days till the next full moon. Can you quit? No. What's next? - I go to Atlanta. - Crawford? No. I have to be alone. You're talking about doing exactly what you said you... This killing, it's gotta stop. William, you're gonna make yourself sick or get yourself killed. You and Kevin should go to Montana. Go see your dad. He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time. And I'll come up and get you afterwards. Hi, this is Valerie Leeds. Sorry I can't come to the phone right now. - I'm sorry, too. - Excuse me. Coffee. It's just you and me now, sport. I'm gonna find you, God damn it. - Mr. Dollarhyde? - Ah, Eileen. Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three. But he caught it in time. Eileen, uh... Good. Good. - Who's there? - Mr. Dollarhyde. I came about the low-light infrared emulsion. Oh, yeah. Come on in, it's safe. Put your back against the door. And there's a stool just to your right. You're the production controller from Admin, right? Can you give me an idea of the conditions? Um, shooting from maybe eight feet. - I can't use any lights. - Mm-hm. Okay, what's being photographed? The activities of nocturnal animals. When do you need it? Four days. Okay, let me stick this in the black hole. 1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness. Remember to be very careful with it. But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series. It'll be fine. In case you're wondering, I keep the samples straight by touch code. I-I wasn't wondering. Reba, I gotta fly. Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight? No, that's okay. I'll take care of myself. - I can change things around. - No, thanks, go on. Okay. - No, I'll take you. - No, thanks. I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning. - Ride with me. - Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time. Ride with me. It would be because I would like you to. Okay, sure. Let me get my stuff on. How did you come to Gateway? Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract. You worked out well. Yeah, well, everybody they hired did. You know, you speak very well. Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants. At the Riker Institute for the Blind, I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children. I'll probably go back to it someday. Mm-hm. You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay. But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say. May I touch your face? I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning. I guess I... I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not. Take my word for it. I'm smiling. I didn't mean to offend you. On the way, can I take you somewhere? Where? It would be my surprise. Okay, sure. - Are you apprehensive? - No. The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us. No, no, I want to. In about two hours, we're going to cap his tooth. Yeah. It's warm. Back a little bit. There. - You hear it? - Yeah. You... rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do. You think that what you do will make you into something different. You are becoming. What is it you think you're becoming? The answer is in the way you use the mirrors. What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming? A little to your left. Francis, that was a great dinner. Thank you. I made you a gin and tonic. It's right in front of you. Oh. What are you watching? Oh, it's just a little homework. Mmm. You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D. Your heart's loud. If you'll hold me... - Is that you, D? - Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. - Hi. - Hi. - Good morning. - Morning. Well, you know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee. No, no, uh... - Don't go back inside the house. - Why? I left my purse inside. I'll get it. It's okay. I mean, you should stay outside, it's... It's 'cause you look so good in the sun. Okay. Um... When, uh... Reba, when can I see you again? Oh, um... Hey, we could meet at my house. You got the message Lecktor called? Yeah. I arranged for him to have a phone. I gotta call him in a few minutes. Good. Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler. G-7816 Goodyear truck tires. Looks like our boy drives a van. I'm setting up our base in Chicago. When are you coming back? When I'm done, Jack. Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI. Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor. Hello? Hello, Will. I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admire that enormously. Oh, what a cunning boy you are, Will. I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches, Lecktor. You got something to say, say it. I want to help you. You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself. We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs, and pancreas, and everything else. Why fight it? Fight what? Did you realty feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death? I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did. But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it? Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why shouldn't it feel good? It must feel good to God. He does it all the time. God's terrific. He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to His Majesty. Don't you think that felt good? Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor? It feels good, Will, because God has power. And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is. God's a champ. He always stays ahead. He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month. Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring? I enter. The glass cutter. The piece of glass I take out is mine. The house is mine. I walk up these stairs, I pass the children's toys. Children mean nothing to me. They were put here to help me. I move to the door. I step into the room. I see you there. And I see me desired by you. Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes. I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow... Wait a minute. What was it? - Pollen. - Oh. - Thanks for the ride. - See you tomorrow. Yeah. Mr. Dollarhyde. What are you doing here? - Who is it? - It's me. - Who? Who is it? - It's me. Oh. - Francis? - No... Not Francis. Francis is gone. Francis is gone forever. So, what are we doing? The dream. He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him. - Changes? - It's a word. Killing and arranging the people to imitate it. And Lecktor told me something. If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is. You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted, and desired, and accepted. It'll all come true. But he doesn't take anything. There's no souvenirs taken from the houses. He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event. Maybe he records it somehow... so he could see himself accepted over, and over, and over again. VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what? How do I know? How does he find 'em? When we find out how he found them, we'll find him. There is no connection between the two families. We've done a dozen computer runs. Jack, all the women have a bloom on them. He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women. There's selection and design in his choices. Look, admit we struck out this month. The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene will be fresh, fresher than we've ever had it. - It's not over yet. - Oh, for Christ's sake! It's a foregone conclusion. It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight. Give it up! Forget this month, it's too damn late! I gave it up. Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five, and six, right? You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again! Great! But don't talk to me about late, pal. I'll tell you when it's too fucking late! Until then, we go as late as I want to take it! A padlock. That's why the bolt cutter. What's that? He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door? Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed. Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14. Sometime between April 14 and August 1 they changed the lock. But he thought there was a padlock there. From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door. There's a big, high fence there. But he was ready with his glass cutter. So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough, or... - We checked. - Don't talk. Metcalfe, it's Graham. Is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom? Have the guard down there call me. Do it. You know that's the Jacobis' cat. You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock. The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man? See the woman? The bloom on the woman? You can see her again and again anytime you want. Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog. And the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door. And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it? Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing. Reflections, mirrors, images... You've seen these films. Haven't you, my man? It's the guard in the storeroom. - The cans. - What cans? The tapes were transferred from home movies. Where's the packaging the films came in? There's films of the families in the document storage. Find them. You got 'em? Are there any labels? Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label. Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. Who processed the Jacobi film? No. Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham. Stores send them out. Have him peel the top label back. Is there a label underneath? It does, doesn't it? Where are you? Are you here? You're scaring me with this! Will you just stop it? Francis, why are you doing this to me? It's ugly! Are you in this room? Where are you? You answer me! We're looking for a man. We know he works at Gateway. We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van. Under "Employee Facilities," I've got special stickers for vans. Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer. Start feeding me names. Is this Lieutenant Fisk? Will Graham. Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you. The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20 to 40 years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds. - First name? - Alvaro. A-L-V-A-R-O. First name Joseph. Alvaro. A-L-V-A-R-O. First name Joseph. No. Black hair. - No. - Next. Dillon. D-I-L-L-O-N. First name Lincoln. No. Next. Male. Caucasian. Six foot-seven, 217 pounds. Eyes brown, hair blond, 34 years old. Put it through the data-fax. Fast. You guys better buckle up. We're on approach to Lambert Field. Fogel has four more names. He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit. This is our man. Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri. Where is that? From the airport, you're a few minutes closer. We're 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94. Let's go! - Meet point's up ahead. - Go on to the house. - But Lieutenant Fisk said... - Go on to the house. Will? You're not gonna need that. A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us. Will? Will! This ought to be it right here. Kill your lights. - You all right? - I'm okay. Griffin's hurt bad. I'll wait for the backup. Set up a roadblock on Route 3. Graham and I are in the trees west of the house. How far away is the backup unit? I'm going around the back. Stay in the trees. He's in there, Jack. And he's got somebody in there with him. What? Will, what did you say? Will. Wait for the backup, Will. Will! He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack. Will. Stop it. Stop it! It's okay. Who are you? Graham. I'm Will Graham. I'll get it, Ralph. What do you want? My name is Will Graham. I'm with... Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Jesus, right. - Come on in. - Please. No, that's all right. - You okay? - We're fine. We're okay, yeah. Yeah, we're doing all right. Thanks. Listen, um, that guy Crawford called and he was telling me all about... Would you like to come in and have a cup of coffee or a drink? - No, thank you. - Listen, I want... I just stopped by to, uh... Listen, I want... I want to thank you. I-I... I just stopped by... to see you. That's all. Hey, Dad! - Dad! - Hey! Aw, it looks worse than it is, pal. See the turtles? Wow! Hi. It was on the... news. I thought I had to work things out and call you after. I thought I wouldn't wait. How many of them made it? Most of 'em. Most of 'em made it.
