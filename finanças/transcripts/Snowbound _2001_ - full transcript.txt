- I understand that, but... Well, how soon can I expect the order? Yeah, it's a problem. I promised... Fine. Please call me if there are any more changes. Hey. Hey. - I just got off the phone with the buyer from Ramati. He wouldn't crack. - But you got your price? - Of course. - Yeah. I wish I had a fraction of your nerve. - Nerve? Well, you know what I mean. - You didn't get it? - Connors. - Connors? He's been here half the time that you have. What gives them the right to pass you up? - I didn't ask 'em to explain. And why not? - They made their decision. What's the point? Barb, you can't let people just walk all over you. It's not fair. You've invested a lot of years in this company. - Come on. We have reservations for seven o'clock. - What's that? - Surprise for Gunnar. - Well, that's nice. On account of what? On account of I'm crazy about him. Oh. - I'm parked in a lower garage today, so I'll met you there. - All right. - Ow, ow! - Hey! Hey! Liz, open the door. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - What happened? - That guy attacked me. - Oh my God. We have to call the police. Are you sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Gonna need more than a broken foot to make an ID. - Well, next time I'll ask him to pose for a photograph. - We're just doin' our job, ma'am. - I'm sure you are. What is that? - I found it just outside my car door before the guy jumped me. - That's a strange kind of a thing to take to a mugging. Well, we'll check the emergency wards, but aside from that, ma'am, I'm not sure how much more we can do. - Well, that's comforting. - Thank you, officer. We appreciate it. - No problem, ma'am. Have a good evening. - You, too. I don't know about you, but I could use a drink right now. - Yeah, me too. You know what I'm thinking? - Time to get a can of pepper spray? - If that guy really wanted to do something to me, I wouldn't be here right now. - Well then, why would he be... - He was sent to scare me. - Sent? Come on, Liz. - I'm serious. Who would do that? - You know that music box I found by my car? It was a gift from my ex-husband on our wedding day. He knew I loved Mozart. When I walked out on him, I left it behind with everything else. - Honey, that has to be a coincidence. There must be thousands of music boxes just like that one. - Trust me. It's Dale's way of letting me know he knows exactly where I am and how to get to me. - Why? - Because he's nuts. Certifiable. That's why I left him. That's why I got an unlisted number when I moved back here. - Then you shoulda told the police when you had the chance. - Yeah, but I can't prove anything. You never met him, did you? - No. We weren't in touch in those days. - Then you can't possibly know what he's like. - Do you wanna come stay with me for a while? Your boyfriend would really like that. - I'll explain. It'll be fine. - I'm all right. - You know I'm here for you. - I know. What're you gonna do if he comes back? Maybe I'll buy a gun. I'm only kidding. - Now you're scaring me. - Okay. - Take care. - Okay, I will, 'kay. - Promise? - I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. - Promise? - Yes. - Bye. - Son of a bitch. - Hey. - Hi. - Did you have a late dinner? - Something really terrible happened tonight. - What, what happened? - Liz got mugged in the parking lot at work. - Is she all right? - Yeah, she's lucky. - Well, what about you? How 'bout you? - I'm okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. I almost forgot. What is this? - Open it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Oh man. Oh, Barbara. Hey, look at this. Whoa. Barbara, that is, that is very handsome. - Just like you. - Well, I, I don't know what to say, sweetheart. I mean, I think this is, this is way too generous. - I know that we haven't been together that long, but, um, I really love what we have. And I pre-set the alarm, so that every time it rings, you'll think of me. Well, you wanna know something? - What? - I think about you anyway. - You do? - All the time. - Really? - Oh, are you kidding? Hi, You've reached Gunnar and Barbara. We're not in right now, so leave a message. - Hey, Barb, it's Liz. Listen, I'm still pretty shook up about what happened last night. I'm gonna be leaving town. I just need to be by myself for a while. I wanted to let you know in case you tried to call. - Liz, I'm here. - Hey! Um, look I've thought it over, and I'm just gonna make myself scarce for a couple of days. - Honey, if you're that scared, why don't you go to the police? Well, I've already rented this cabin. By yourself? Well, I can't stay here, not after what happened last night. - Would you feel better if I tagged along? - Sure. But what would Gunnar say? - He'll be okay with it. And the office? - Well, it's been a couple years since I've taken any vacation time, and it is only a couple days, right? - Right. Well, how soon can you be ready? I'll start packing now. - Okay, I'll pick you up at noon, then. 'Kay. - Okay. 9-1-1 operator. - Yes, hello. Uh, someone's been following me, and now they're parked outside my window... Watching. I can't believe you're actually thinking about going with her. - Gunnar, she thinks her ex-husband's after her. It sounds like she's being a little paranoid to me. - I still don't want her going by herself. Jealous? - No, I'm not jealous. More like concerned. - About? - About you. - Well, don't be. I can take of myself. - Yeah, that's what I am afraid of. - What's that supposed to mean? - It doesn't mean anything, Barbara, just, you know, I care about you. - Liz is my oldest, dearest friend. She really needs me right now. - Okay. - So you're not mad at me, then? - How could I be mad? I actually love you more you stick by your friends. Wish I had a friend like you. You do. Mm, hey, buddy,. - Can I see you driver's license, please? - You know, in a way, if you gotta go, really isn't a bad time. Why is that? - Well, they called a divisional meeting up north this week, kinda last minute, but I gotta be there. They're, uh, introducing new products. - That was soon. - Yeah, you know how the higher-ups are. But let me tell you what I was thinking. See, I'm not gonna be too far from where you're staying, and what I was thinking, maybe I can come up for a little visit afterwards. - Yeah? - Yeah, get a chance to meet little Ms. Crisis there. - Very funny. - Yeah, let me tell you something. You know, you're gonna miss me up there. - Am I? - Yeah, yeah, it gets, uh, pretty damn cold up on them there mountains. - Well, that's why they have electric blankets. - Anything else electric? - Maybe. - Huh? - What's it to ya? What's it to you? - All right. Do me a favor and call me on my cell phone, okay? - 'Kay. - Leave the number to the cabin. - Soon as I get it from Liz I will. - Hey, but, uh, seriously, have a, have a fun trip. - Good luck with your meetings. - Thank you. I go. - Hey, what happened? You're late. - I know. The car wouldn't start. I had to get a new battery. Took forever, I'm sorry. - Coulda called, you know. - I know. I didn't think it would take that long. - There's a huge storm heading up north. - Yeah, it's all over the radio. We'll just have to drive fast. What are we doing? - I just have to make a quick stop before we leave town. - Okay. - I'll just be a minute. - All right. Sure. - Hello, I'd like to get into my safe deposit box. Uh, here's my ID. - Do you have your key, Ms. Garnett? - I do. - Please sign in. Thank you. - Great, thank you. Please follow me. - Okay. - Hey, what's in the case? - Oh, camera equipment. It's expensive, so I keep it in the safety deposit box. - Oh, that's smart. Cabin, here we come. - I can't wait. So listen to this. Apparently, Elvis has been seen in Atlantic City, renting a house with John F. Kennedy, and they are both in love with an exotic dancer who closely resembles Marilyn Monroe. - They never know when to give up, do they? - Oh my God. Damn! What? Oh, nothing. - Hey, leadfoot, where's the fire? - Sorry. - You all right? - Yeah, why? - Because you're driving like the cops are after us, so slow down! Yeah, sure, I'll be with you in a second, Hank. Now here you go, ladies, just like you ordered. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Are you sure that you don't want anything? - Mm, no, I'm not hungry. - Liz? - Mm? - Relax. - I will, once we get there. - Speaking of which, I don't have an address or a phone number to where we're going. - Well, I didn't tell anyone where we were going. - Gunnar needs to know where I am. - Why? Is he your Svengali? - I want him to know where I am. - Well, don't you have a cell phone? - Yeah, but what if it doesn't work up there? - Okay. The realtor faxed it over this morning. - 'Kay. - There you go. - Thank you. - Mm hm. - You know, I'm so sorry, but we, we should get going. - We just sat down. - I know, but I wanna beat that storm. Really need to relax. - Can you have him fill it up? - Yeah. Hey, it's Gunnar. Leave a message at the beep. - Hey honey, it's me. Uh, we just pulled off the highway, talk about desolate. Anyway, the number where we will be staying is 555-0193. Okay, I gotta go. I love you. - Well, you're about 100 miles south of Marshall Falls right now, but if I were you, I wouldn't stay around here for too long. - Well, don't worry, we've got nice warm cabin waiting for us. - Ah, it's a good thing, 'cause this storm that's comin', it's gonna be a doozie. - So we've heard! - Well, you two be careful. And don't forget your chains, 'cause we'll be ticketing. - Thanks officer, we won't. - Do we have chains? - Of course not. - Great. - Oh, would you pay him for the gas? I'll be right back. - Now where're you going? - Gotta pee. You mind? - How's she look? - Oil looks all right. Might wanna think about replacing that battery, though. - Um, how much for the gas? - $24.50. - Okay, 25. - Thanks, be right back with your change. - 'Kay. Aren't you beat? No, why? You've been doing all the driving. Oh, I don't mind. - Didn't you tell me that you got a new battery this morning? - Yeah, why? - 'Cause I looked under the hood at the gas station when you were in the bathroom. - And it wasn't brand spanking new, right? - Right. - Well, that's easy enough to explain. I, I couldn't afford a new battery, so I just put in an old one. - Oh. How come he scares you so much? - Who, Dale? - No, the Easter bunny. The four years I spent with Dale were the worst years of my life. - Did he abuse you? - Every chance he could. - Why did you stay with him? - Why does any woman stay? Lack of confidence, self-esteem. I was completely dependent. - But you got away. - Only because I finally stood up for myself. - He never came after you? - Oh, he tried, but thankfully, he had this little problem. - What little problem? - Oh, extortion, grand larceny, racketeering. He had warrants out on him in three states. They finally caught up with him. - God, Liz, how did you get caught up in that? - When we first met, he was the most charming, romantic man that I had ever met. But he changed. He became mean, twisted. I could do no right in his eyes. When I met up with you again, it was like starting over. You know, you helped me get my job, my apartment, my self-esteem back. I finally thought that everything was gonna be all right for a change. - So if he's in prison, what's the problem? - Dale was paroled two months ago. I just found out. Don't look back. - What? Why? - I mean it, don't look back. That car's been following us since we left the gas station. - It's probably just somebody else who'd headed up to Marshall Falls. - I know it's him. - See? Nothing to worry about. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna have a great time. Well, here we are. It's great. Just like I pictured it. - Hey! You made it. Mrs. Hotchkiss? - Oh, just call me Sarah. - Hi, I'm Liz Garnett. Hey. - This is Barbara Kates. - Hi, how ya doin'? - Good. - Sarah is the realtor that rented us the cabin. - Oh, great. - So, come on in. - All right. - Watch yourself. Beautiful. - Oh, thanks. You gotta be careful, 'cause these steps are icy. Come on in, girls. I'll show you around. Just set your stuff down anywhere. Kitchen! I left you some breakfast stuff to get you started. Uh, there's phone numbers on the wall there that'll help you out. The market's down the road apiece, about three miles that way. This is a real wood-burning fireplace. You're gonna need wood and matches. Matches are right here, but you gotta use kindling to get it going, okay? No problem. - The study, TV, satellite hookup right there, so you can get all the sex and violence you'll ever possibly need. - Okay. - And before I forget, please, please, the owner was very specific about this, do not go into the gun cabinet. It's in the lease. - What if we're attacked by a moose? - Well, run really fast and don't wear red. Okay. - Um, pick up the phone, call Sam Wattrus. He's the local sheriff. - Well, it's just as nice as you described. - Oh, good. - What about the ski resorts? Are they close by? - About a mile away, but the trick is getting there. - Well, we have four-wheel drive. - That's fine, but if they haven't plowed the roads, uh, your best bet's gonna be that old snowmobile over on the back porch. - You're kidding, right? - Welcome to the mountains, girls. Any questions? - I can't think of anything offhand. - The MacKenzies live across the road, but they're away, and, uh, I'm looking after their dog, Cody, so I'll come by periodically, make sure you two are doing okay. - Well, I don't foresee having any problems. - Oh, you have no idea what these storms can bring. - Well, thank you very much for everything. We appreciate it. Okay, anyhoo, I gotta go, so enjoy, um, and, uh, have a good evening. Bye bye. Thanks. Bye! She's a trip. I liked her. - Yeah, well, you like everyone. - Sue me. - Shit! Good morning, Marshall Falls.

Remember, he told the whole damn school. I was so embarrassed. I didn't speak to anybody for weeks. Except me. - Except you. Liz, is there something that you wanna tell me? - Like what? I don't know. Lately I just get the feeling that you're kinda holding something back from me. - I'm probably just stressed out about Dale and everything. - Yeah. I understand. But you know I'm here if you wanna talk. - Thanks, Barb. - That's what best pals are for. Hardest hit by last night's storm was the pass leading into Marshall Falls, with a pretty good accumulation of snow. Although residential areas were spared, this might not hold true when the second wave of the storm moves in later this afternoon and evening. Gusts up to 50 miles per hour are expected. Transportation authorities have issued a travel advisory. Hey. - Coffee? - Yeah. We'll continue to keep you informed. This has been a storm... Oh boy. - You up for some skiing? - 50-mile-an-hour gusts? I don't think so. - Oh, come on, you're the daredevil. - Daredevil, yes. Stupid, no. - Hello? Hey, it's me. - Hey, sweetie. Get there okay? - Yes, we're here safe. How are things going in Siberia? - You heard about the storm, huh? Oh God, it's all over the news. How's it going out there? Your friend's not wearing a hockey mask and carrying a chainsaw, is she? - Be nice. You know I can rent a car and be there in two hours. - That's assuming the roads stay open. I wouldn't chance it, honey. It's okay. What's that? That was the alarm on my watch. See, I'm thinking of you. - I don't like it when we're apart. Ah, me neither. I love you, baby. I love you, too. Bye. - Who was that? - Gunnar. He was gonna come rescue us from the storm, but I told him that we would tough it out ourselves. - Good for you. - See? - Mm hm. - You could clear something up for me. - Sure. - What's the deal with the battery? - What do you mean? - You know you didn't buy it used. Is this really worth talking about? - Yeah, I think it is. - Look, I don't know why I lie. Sometimes I just do. I was running late at the office, and I didn't want to admit how disorganized I was, so I just made up some stupid story. - Liz, I'm your best friend. You don't have to do that with me. - I know. - 'Kay. - Where're you going? - Town. We need food. You wanna come? - No, I'll just stay here. - Okay. - Oh, but you could do something for me. - Sure. - Could you mail that? What is it? - It's just some paperwork from the office that I forgot to take care of. - Sure. - And first class. - Okay, no problem. - And Barb? I'm sorry. - It's already forgotten. But no more stories, okay? - Okay. - 'Kay. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Ma'am. - Hi, I'm glad you're still open. Yes, ma'am, for about 10 minutes. - Oh, I just have to stock up on a few things. - Good idea. - On days like this, we make like bears and hibernate. - It's not that bad where we are. - Well, maybe so, but the pass is still closed. There's no way in or out unless you've got a snow cat. - 'Till when? Bye, Leo. Couple o' days. - Mm. - Last chance for coffee, folks. What would you like? - Coffee, please. - Great choice. - I'm Barbara Kates. My girlfriend and I are renting the house down the road. - Yeah, the Howard place. Sarah Hotchkiss told me about you two. I'm Sam Wattrus. - Hi. You brought some, uh, pretty interesting weather up here with you. - That we did. - Leo's Market. Sam, Clay's calling for you. - Yeah, go ahead, Clay. Uh huh. Ah, damn. How long ago? How bad is it? Okay, okay, you stay put. I'm on my way. What happened? - Bad accident. Big rig ran into a bus. We can't medevac anyone. The helicopters are all grounded. They've put out a call for all the volunteer deputies. Doesn't look very good. - How long will you be gone? - As long as it takes. Pleasure, ma'am. - See, you get to hurrying in a snowstorm, look what happens. I won't lock up till you get your groceries. - Oh, I'll just be a minute. - Take your time. The second wave of the storm has moved in, causing major accidents on local highways. Police are working closely with the Highway Department to clear the roads, but there is so much work to do that, this reportedly, that there is no chance of the roads being completely clear until tomorrow morning. Prospective travelers are advised to stay indoors until further notice, and to check with the Highway Department for current road conditions. The storm is expected to pass sometime this evening, clearing the way for warmer temperatures. In other news, a woman in New England... - Hi. - Hey. - Just thought I'd, uh, come by and check up on you girls. - Everything's fine. - They're expecting another wave of that storm. - Oh, I heard. - Supposed to be worse than last night. - Well, I'll be building a big fire. - There's a cord of wood out back. - I'm sure I'll find it. - Where's your friend? - She actually went to the market. - Oh, I'll be, uh, taking Cody with me. - Cody? - The neighbor dog. Right. - Well, if there's anything else I can do for you, let me know. - I will, thanks. - See ya. Bye bye. - Some weather, huh? Rice cereal, healthy. You like alphabet soup? - I grew out of it. - Sure picked the last minute to stock up, huh? You and your friend. - That's right. - I grabbed me a room at the hotel. Times like these, they get snapped up quick. Figure if you're gonna get stranded, better go for the free satellite TV, you know what I mean? So what brings you way up here? - Vacation. Some vacation. What with the weather and everything. - It's all part of the adventure. - Cool. I'm into adventure. - Excuse me. Okay. Oh, I almost forgot. Um, do you think you can take care of this for me? Well, the mail probably won't be moving until after the storm. Oh, that's okay. $35.36. - Thanks. - And you better get where you're going, 'cause we're closing up. - I'm on my way. Thanks. - You know, I think I followed you partway last night. That's how I know about your friend. Get away from me. - Oh man, you left your lights on. Hope you got enough juice. - Start. - Hey, you know, they're leaving the lounge open at the hotel. Why don't you come by for a drink later? You and I'd have a lot of fun, I promise you that. - Shit. Come on! - See? What'd I tell ya? Your battery's dead. Pop the hood, I'll give ya a jump Now, I can jump ya now, or you can sleep here in your car all night. It's your choice. - Just go away. - You know, hotel's only a couple miles down the way. - I told you no. - Oh, come on, don't be like that. Roll down the window. Let's talk for a sec. - What part of no don't you understand? - I could even come to you. I know where you and your friend are staying. - Yeah, well maybe I'll think about it, once you start the car first. - Okay, give her some juice. - Come on! Yes! - Hey! Hey! Tell your girlfriend her hubby sends his love! - Hey. What's wrong with you? - I don't know, Liz. You tell me. - What are you talking about? - Last night I saw a car outside of the cabin, and I just saw that same car in town, then some freak starts hassling me. He says he know where we're staying, Liz. - I tried to tell you someone was following us, but you wouldn't listen. - It's Dale, right? - I think so. - What've you gotten me into here? - Oh, look, I didn't invite you. You did that all by yourself. - You also didn't explain the situation. - You can bail anytime, Barb. - No, I can't bail, Liz. The roads are closed. I am stuck here whether I like it or not. - Hey. Can we just try and make the best of this? - What else are you not telling me, Liz? - What do you mean? - I mean, I think it's time that I know exactly what we're dealing with here. - Barb, you and I, we're reasonable people. We know where to draw the line. We get mad, we might get even sometimes, but there are places we won't go, and there are things we won't do. Dale is not like that. - Explain. - When Dale and I were married, we had a cat named Julius. It kept scratching the furniture, so one day Dale grabbed it and took it out to the hot tub. He held it under, and when I asked him why, he said its tags had expired. - That's disgusting. - That's when I knew something was wrong with him. I started to question everything he had ever told me, like what happened to his parents. - What happened to his parents? - He told me they died in a plane crash when he was a senior in high school, but after digging around, I found out different. There wasn't any plane crash. It was a home invasion robbery. - Okay, but why would he lie about that? One guess. - It wasn't a home invasion. - Nothing was missing from the house. Dale was the key suspect. The DA was convinced it was him, but he didn't have enough evidence to prosecute. Dale was completely exonerated. - And you think he killed them? - I know he did. And now he's trying to kill me. - But why? - I don't know, maybe he thinks I abandoned him, and... - And? - I helped send him to prison this last time. - Oh, God, Liz, that's just great. Great. What are you thinking? You have to ask? Damn. - Hey, let me try this. There goes your security deposit. Well, let's see what we got. There's only one thing missing. - What's that? - Ammunition. Check the other cabinets. - Okay, come on, Cody. Oh, come on this way. Cody! Cody, come on! Cody! Ah, brother. Cody! - Who in their right mind would own a gun and not have bullets? Hello? Liz? - Yes. It's Sarah. I just got home, and wouldn't you know it, Cody bolted out of the car, and I have a feeling he's gonna be headed straight back to you guys. If something happens to him, I'll never forgive myself, and anyways, if you see him, can you please give me a call? - If I see him, I'll call you. - Okay, well, you girls bundle up, 'cause this storm is gonna be bad. - Okay, bye, now. Bye. Who was that? - Sarah Hotchkiss. The dog got out. We're supposed to keep an eye out for him. - Oh, 'cause we don't have enough to worry about now. - What are you doing? - What I shoulda done first thing this morning. Sheriff's office. - Hello, may I please speak to Sheriff Sam Wattrus? Ma'am, he's been called away to the scene of an accident and isn't available. - Um, who'm I speaking with? - This is Clay Tomlin. I'm his deputy. - Deputy, hi, uh, my girlfriend and I are renting the Howard place near Marshall Falls. We believe that we are being stalked. We need to get some protection from you. - Well, I can fill out a report, but that's the best I can do right now. - No, you don't understand. We need somebody here right away. It's gonna be dark soon. - Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but everyone's been called away on account of that accident on the highway. Now it's an awful mess. We got a road closed, people killed. They've even had to send for a crane. - Well, what are you doing right now? - Someone's gotta man the phones. There's people having problems over three counties. - Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry about that, but what are we supposed to do? Lock up, stay by the fire, and I'll send somebody when I can. - Thank you, that's very reassuring. - No police? - Not even a forest ranger. You know what? I'm calling Gunnar. Hey, it's Gunnar. Leave a message at the beep. - Gunnar, it's Barbara. Please call me as soon as you get this message. It's very important. Hey, I found some. That's all? - That's all. - We've only got two. - That's if they're even any good. - You get one, I get the other. Do you have a better idea? - Well, yeah, I think the best shot should get both. - Have you ever used one of these before? - No, have you? - Oh, I used to shoot tin cans at Camp Brownlee, but... Well, then, you're elected. - Me? Liz, shooting tin cans and blowing away your husband. - Look, whatever happens, we can say it was self-defense. - It is self-defense. - Exactly. - So that no accidents happen, we will leave these here until we need them. - Stopped snowing. - It's about time. - Do you hear that? - What? Listen. - Sounds like that dog. Yeah, but I don't see him. - He'll come in out of the cold when he gets hungry. - Mm. - I'll get it. Hello? It's Gunnar, I got your message. Are you okay? - No, it's not okay. Uh, Liz's ex-husband has turned into Charles Manson, and he's trying to kill her. Are you kidding me? - Yeah, he followed us up here. I talked to him, I, I saw him, Gunnar. I'm scared. I'm on my way. - I'm sorry, honey. Yeah, okay, I'll see ya soon. - Bye. - Cody! - Cody! - One whiff o' this, and he'll come running. - It smells terrible. Cody, come here. - Where are ya, buddy? - Crummy dog. - Cody! You see that? I think he's over in the trees. Aren't you coming? - I'll just wait here. - What are you, the Cowardly Lion, now? Dale might be out there. Hey Barb, do you wanna take this? - Just watch my back. Cody! Cody, come get your beef stew, ya pain in the ass. Cody, come here, boy. Cody? Cody! Come here, boy. Where are ya, ya mutt? Cody! Cody. Cody, here boy. Where are you? Ah, shit. Cody! Cody, where are you? Cody, come here, boy. Cody, here, boy. Liz! Liz, run! - What? Get in the house! - What? What? What happened? - I found the dog. - And? - He's dead. - Oh my God. - Liz, he was butchered. Oh my God. - What is it you said he did to your cat? - Did you see him? - No, I saw fresh tracks in the snow. He's out there. He's out in the woods. - If he comes through that door, you blast him with this. - It's probably just the trees banging against the house. - Probably. But maybe... - Liz, can you please try not to scare me all the time? - I'm sorry. - Forget it. Gunnar's gonna be here soon anyway. - Well, I doubt it. Well, I mean, just with the weather and everything, it'll take him a while to get here. Just don't worry. - Well, that's easy for you to say, thank you. - Gin. - Again? You know what, Liz, I can't play right now. I can't, I can't think. - Barb? - Uh huh? - For the things I said earlier that weren't exactly true, I'm sorry. - Let's just forget about it, okay? - You're my best friend, you know. You always have been. - I know. - Hey. - Yeah? - There's something else you should know. - Oh, God. - I can't let you go into this without knowing exactly where you stand. - Meaning? - Dale is coming tonight. - How do you know he is? - I know because I planned it. - You planned what, Liz? - We have to kill him. He wants his money. - What money? - The money from his last score. He knows I have it. That's why we're here. - Why doesn't that surprise me? Is that what was really in that silver case? - $2 million. - You stupid bitch! - Barb, I had to! I had to! I had to get something for all those years I was with him. - Cash, maybe. Ambush, definitely not, Liz. - Look, I've thought it all out. - Oh, thank God, 'cause for a minute, I thought we were winging it. - Listen to me, it'll be better if you pull the trigger. Let him get close, and then let him have it. And don't miss. - You are my best friend, but I am not gonna do this for you. - I'll cut you in. - No way! - He's here. - Oh, shit. Okay. - Where are you going? To get some candles. - No, don't go back there! Why not? - I unlocked the door! - You what? God! Oh, shit, okay. It's dead. - He cut the lines. Here, take the gun. - Oh, God. Hurry, hurry. Liz? Liz? Liz! Where are you? Liz! Damn it, where did you go? Liz! ♪ Take me out to the ballgame ♪ You take one more step, and I will shoot you. - You ain't gonna shoot me. - I mean it, don't come any closer. - I think you got a problem. I think you got a big problem. You and your friend are stuck out here all alone, ain't you? No phone, no one to come get you. Now where's the money? - It's in the silver case. Just take it and get outta here. - Case already been dug up. It's empty. Where's the money? - Liz, you wanna help me out here? - I ain't gonna ask you again, now where's the money? - I don't know! - You better start talking, baby, or I'm gonna hit me a home run! - Are you okay? - No, Liz. I'm not okay. I can't believe you did this to me. Damn! What? - This isn't Dale. - What do you mean? No, this is the man I told you about in town this morning that was harassing me. - Wiley H. Prevost. - Oh my God! - Parole card. It's probably one of Dale's prison buddies. This is the guy from the parking garage. - His, his shoes don't match the tracks that I saw in the snow today. - What? That means Dale's out there. Come on, we have, we have to check the doors. - No, no! - Liz? - Hey, wait, stop! Come back! Hey! Hey! Oh, Gunnar. Gunnar. - Hey, hey, what are you doing out here? You're freezing, here. Here. What are you doing out here? - She's dead. - Who? Who, who's dead? - Liz. Dale killed her. - Barbara, what, what're you talking about? - We should've gotten out of that cabin when we had the chance, and we didn't. - Well, I think I should go check. - No, no, I'm not going back there, Gunnar. - Barbara, she could still be alive. - She's not, she's dead. I saw her myself. Please don't make me go back, please. - Oh, man. - I can't. - I should call the police. Hello, police? Yes, uh, I'd like to report a, uh, well, an assault. A possible fatality may be involved here. You're not going out there, are you? - No, no, no, of course not. I'm gonna stay here right here with you until police get here. I'll keep the motor running so we keep the heat on, okay? - 'Kay. - Why don't you close your eyes and rest a while? - Gunnar! Gunnar! Gunnar! Where are you? Gunnar? What is going on? Oh, come on. - Sheriff's office, Deputy Clay Tomlin speaking. - Why aren't you here? Where would that be, ma'am? - The Howard place. My boyfriend called and reported a murder. - Well, no one's reported anything like that, ma'am, and I've been on duty here since 10 o'clock yesterday morning. - I don't understand. Why don't you tell me what happened? - Two people are dead, and now I think maybe something happened to my boyfriend, that's what happened. - Slow down, tell me your name. - Barbara Kates. - I remember you. You stay put. I'll get someone over there right away. - Please hurry. There you are. - You scared me. - Sorry about that. - Where you been? - I've been out here looking around, but, uh, I couldn't find nothing, no bodies, no blood, nothing. What do you think happened? - I don't know. Baby, can we get outta here, please? This place makes me very nervous. - Yeah, sure, come on. What do you think this guy Dale was after, anyway? - Liz stole some money from him. - Any idea where it is? - The money? Yeah. - No, no, she didn't tell me. - Well, you know, you would think that best friends wouldn't keep secrets from each other, you know. - Yeah, well it turns out I didn't know Liz as well as I thought I did. - Funny how that happens. - So, what do you think happened to the police? - I don't know. - Because you called them from the car. - Well, yeah, but, I mean, you know how crazy cell phones can be, you know, I mean, I don't know, I probably had a crazy connection, something like they could hear me, I couldn't hear them, something like that. - That's okay, 'cause I called them, so they're, they're really coming now. - How'd you do that? - Uh, I found Liz's cell phone. - Well, you know, Barbara, sometimes you're a real pain in the as. - Yeah, well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Dale. Dale, no! Let go of me! Get off me! - Come on, honey. Come on, darling. Let go of me. - Unless you tell me where that money is, I'm gonna do a lot more than that. Get in! - No, no! - Ah, don't mind them. They don't talk much anymore. - Why me? - Well, Liz took all my money and cut out on me, went to LA, that much I knew. Rest was a dead end. Until I remembered her lifelong friend, good old Barbara Kates, the one she always talked about. So what'd I do? Changed my name to Gunnar, gave myself a new history, sold you the whole bag of groceries. - You miserable piece of... - Hey, come on, if the shoe fits. - I was in love with you. Well, you are only human, after all. So why the phony mugging? - Well, the trick was to get Liz to cut and run with the money. I couldn't break my cover, so, uh, that's what ol' Wiley was about back there. To keep her scared. - Hey, the blind leading the blind. Don't you even think about running away from me. I'll break one of your legs if I have to. You hear me? Watch your step. All right, here we go. Okay. Start digging. I'm serious, start digging. Start digging. Dig. You know, something's been really bugging me. - Ask me if I care. - Well, you know, I saw you guys at the bank, I saw Liz here walk out with the case, and I followed you guys up here, and I know she didn't stash it in the restaurant or the gas station, because she never took the case out of the car. - So you were too stupid to find it in the cabin. - Yeah, you were too stupid to find it in the cabin. That's impossible, 'cause I tore the whole place apart, and it's not in there. - Then it's outside, you moron! - Nah, I don't know, our little friend Liz there only ventured outside once by herself, the night she buried the case in the snow to goad me on. - God, I wish she'd killed you. - One thing you have to realize, Barbara, is that, uh, luck has always been on my side. - Come on. Come on! - Hey! Open up, you bitch! You ain't getting away from me, baby. Come on! Through playing games, Barbie. Yahoo! - Oh, damn it. I'm coming for ya, Barbara! You hear me? I'm coming for you! I see you! - I just called 9-1-1. They know where we are! - Don't lie to me. You don't even know where we are. Look, Barbara, all I want is my money. - How many times do I have to tell you I don't have it? - Do I look stupid to you, sweetheart? Huh? You were with her the whole time! - Okay, all right, let's say I do know where it is and I tell you, then what? - Well, maybe I'd let ya live. - Oh, go screw yourself, Gunnar, or Dale, whatever your name is. - I'll tell ya what. Don't move. Stay right there. I'll be right back. God. - You wanna play that way with me? All right. Have it your way, honey. Have it your way. Little surprise for ya, Barbara. Little surprise! I love the smell of gasoline in the morning, don't you? All right, Barbara, honey, I'm through playing around with you. Now I'll fry ya if I have to. - Okay, okay. Uh, you win. I'll tell you where the money is, all right? Liz took the stuffing of the car seats out and she replaced it with the money. It's here. It's been here the whole time. - Well, if it's really in there, why don't you throw it out to me? - No, you want it so bad, you come in here and get it yourself. - Okay, all right. All right. - Oh, Gunnar. Missing something? - Man, I am going to kill you. - Then I guess we have nothing left to talk about, do we? - Damn! - This is all of Liz's mail. - Ah, thank you. Hi, I'd like to get into my safe deposit box, please. Here's my ID. - Do you have your key, Miss Garnett? - Yes, I do. - Please follow me.
