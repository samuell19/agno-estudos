"Now it'll be.." "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "Now it'll be.." "IELTS v/s Jatt!" - It was very bad. - It was excellent. I think I will score at least 6. Good. I got confuse. Yes brother.. - How did it go? - Good. 'He is Jaswinder Singh a.k.a. Jassi.' 'He has only one dream.' 'That he should somehow clear IELTS and go to Canada.' 'But the chances of this dream coming true are slim.' 'Because he has already appeared for IELTS, twice.' 'But because he scored less bands, he is trying his luck again today.' - Yes, don't worry. We'll handle it. - How are you doing, bro? - How are you, bro? - Good. Where are you from? Govindgarh. So, Govindgarh. Okay, okay, okay. How did you fare? I think it well quite well. - How about you? - Good. I've done my job, now it's in God's hand. Where did you prepare for the exams? From Grey Matters. - Where? - Grey Matters, bro. Grey Matters. Nice name. Do they coach well? Very well. I am sure to get 7 bands. - Really? - Yeah. I'm confident. That's excellent. May God be with you. - Where do you plan to go? - Canada. Great! I too plan to go to Canada. - Okay. - God willing, see you there. - I need to make a call. - Okay. - I'll talk to you later. - Sure. Let me call Kiran and ask how she fared. - It was good. How did you fare? - Good. I'll score 6 bands at least. - How did you fare? - Last time I scored 5.5. Answer it already. Hello? How are you? How did you fare? How did I fare? It was tough. You know I handed over the written section in 25 minutes. But for the listening section, there was some accented female. I don't know what gibberish she kept saying. I didn't understand anything. I did guesswork and marked the answers. Anyway, forget it. How did you fare? How do you I fared? I did well. I did what I do best. Let it be. Stop bluffing. You had said this last time as well. "I did what I do best." We knew what your best was when the foreigners did what they do best. Stop it and keep put. Don't open old wounds. Okay? I'm sure some illiterate foreigner checked my test back then. He must have not understood what I have written. I will sure score 8 bands. I'll send over sweets to your place. Then you will feel jealous. Oh my! Hear that. See how angry he is. Forget it. Why are you getting angry? I pray that you really manage to get 8 bands. Of course, I will get it. I told you. Fine. God will always do what's best for you. He surely will. By the way, where are you? I.. I am waiting for a bus. These damn buses.. never comes on time. Don't worry. You don't have to travel in buses for much longer. The day I move to Canada, I'll give you a car. Don't worry. Okay, bye. My coffee is getting cold because of you. I have paid 13000 fees here. I should at least enjoy their coffee. Fine, my bus is here. 'And she is Kiranpreet Kaur a.k.a. Kiran.' 'Jassi's childhood from the neighboring village.' 'She too dreams go to Canada just like Jassi.' 'And to fulfill that dream she too appeared for IELTS today.' I seek your blessings, mother. So you are back. - Yes, I am. - God bless you. How did you fare? This time I attempted the whole test. I only fear that once.. ..again some illiterate foreigner might get to check my test. Hey, they won't always make the same mistake. This time they will get it checked by someone sensible. Yes. Shall I make you some tea? This jug is empty. Get me some water. Okay, I'll just get it, son. "Oh Guru Nanak, you work in mysterious ways." "To fulfill their dreams this world prays." I seek your blessing, father. Why bother, why not just hit me? Or even better go for my throat, strangle me or hang me. What have I done now? That's what I am worried about. You don't do anything. You are wasting all the money I have saved so far. I just don't get it. When you aren't any good in Punjabi.. ..how do manage to sit for an English exam? Jassi, get clear your delusions. Tree there too grow only leaves and not dollars. What is wrong? At least let him have some water. You started lashing out on him as soon as you came. It is your love that has spoilt him. - Want some water? - Drink some water. I have already drunk some. When he is saying that he attempted the whole test.. ..then the least you can do is listen to him. Don't be so cruel. You can take it in writing from me.. He won't clear it. And even if he does, he is going just end up cleaning the gutter over there. Father, there are no gutters in Canada. They have sewerage there. It's still a gutter. Same thing. How can it be the same thing? Even if he cleans gutter there, he will earn dollars. Here, he won't even be able to earn 10 bucks. And in the beginning, everyone has to work hard over there. He will surely slowly find good work there. Well done, Punjabis. If all of you keep migrating there.. ..then that day isn't far away when people from UP and Bihar.. ..will be taking over your lands. Tariwal, Grewal, Siddhu, Akrod, Garewal.. They won't be born here anymore. There will be Trivedis, Mishras and Yadavs instead. They are Jatts! Keep your mouth shut if you can't say anything sensible. When is your next exam due, son? On the 28th, mother. When is 28th? Day after tomorrow. It's an English speaking test. - Go, son. Go and prepare for it then. - Okay. By the way, how did Kiran fare? - I spoke to her. - Okay. She got a tough set. She won't get any bands. I hope she clears. You two have always been studying together. We know her family well. We've been friends since past three generations. You are right. She has always cleared along with you. Let's see whether she goes ahead of you or stays behind, this time. Hey, how can she go ahead of Jatt Sahib? - Okay, mother. I'm off to study. - Fine. Jatt Sahib? Mr. Only Good Enough Only To Laze Around. - Jatt Sahib! - Jealous. I seek your blessings, mother. I'm going to attempt the test. God bless you, my son. Score good. How good can I score? They will only score us out of nine. Nine is good enough then. Where's father? He's gone out with the tractor. Don't worry about him. He will only get irritated. Go, son. Do well. Okay, mother. How about some breakfast? I'm making it fresh flatbreads. I'll have pizza in the city. What's that? Something like flatbreads for westerners. They put vegetables on the top. They also give extra peppercorns to sprinkle. Flatbreads are called pizza. - Oh come on, mother. - Strange. Good afternoon, sir. Welcome to the IELTS center. Not from that way, sir. From this way you have to go. This way? So, what is your name? What is your full name? Jaswinder Singh. My name is Jaswinder Singh. Fine, Jaswinder. Can I see your identification please? Yes. - Your passport. - Passport? Passport? I have brought it with me. Passport. Oh, that's wonderful. It is indeed wonderful. So, how many I call you? Call me whenever you want. No, no, no. What name I should call you. Jaswinder Singh. Family affectionately addresses me as Jassi. - Okay. - They love me. - Fine, Mr. Jassi. - Yes. So, you are comfortable? Relaxed? - Yes. - Shall we start with the interview? - You are yet to start it? - Yes. Okay, it will begin now. - Okay. - Okay. This is Sonia Dhawan taking interview of Mr. Jassi. His candidate number is 43210. Let's start with the interview now. Fine? So, where do you live? - Your hometown please? - Hometown? Ma'am, I live in Lachkani village. - It's in Patiala. - Okay. Ma'am, it's very beautiful village. Like it is.. it has so many beautiful things. I mean, ma'am.. It has.. I mean what I want to express cannot be expressed in English. No other place can offer the fun you get while walking.. ..on the paths made between the fields. You feel like dancing. When you see the women cutting greens.. - Okay, fine, fine, Mr. Jassi. - It is a very beautiful sight, I mean.. - My village.. - Okay, Mr. Jassi.. "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "IELTS v/s Jatt!" Fine. So, I think this is fine. - So, this is the end of the speaking test. - Okay. I wish you all the best for your examination. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Have a wonderful weekend. How are you doing, dear? Good. How about you? I am good too. How did your speaking test go? I got stuck at a few places. The rest of it was fine. But that guy kept staring at me. Overall, it went well. They too placed a westerner in front of me. I was so scared of him. If there has been a Punjabi in front of me.. ..then even a simpleton like would have had a good time. Stupid, after clearing IELTS, you will be going to be with westerners. Punjabi professors won't be teaching you out there. Yes, you are right. Forget it. Where are you? I.. I had come to the city with my cousin. Get ready! Our results will be out in 12 days and then we will leave for Canada. Fine. Sister is here. I'll get going. "The handsome has.." Jassi, don't go just yet. My munchkin! Yes, mother? Have something sweet before you leave. Oh come on, mother. Come on, open your mouth. - I don't want it. - Just a little. There you go. My son will get his IELTS score today. Let the results come. I will distribute sweets in the village. Get ready, mother. I'll go and get the results. I'll wait for you right here. Come back soon. Wonderful. Be generous, Lord. Please help him this time. Let me distributes sweets to celebrate. Bye! Hello. Hi. I wanted to see my IELTS result. Sure. Tell me something. Did you do your IELTS through IDB or British? I don't know. But I have a receipt. Here, have a look. - Jaswinder Singh? - Yes. What's the score, bro? I'm checking. Bro.. You scored 5.5 bands. Check again, I should at least get 6 bands. Bro, I am not the one distributing bands here. I can only tell you what you scored. If you don't believe me then here, see it for yourself. Are you happy now? Are you done doing your best? He just wanted to waste 100,000 rupees. I told you that this isn't his cup of tea. But you two wouldn't listen. That's enough. He worked hard. What is his fault if he didn't score? You going soft on him is what has spoilt him. She never stops favoring him. Sit down. Look, we are doing well in farming. You have tried your hand at studying. Get on the tractor and start working in the fields. - Okay, father. - Start farming! You don't talk about anything else. Even the best ones are starving here. He only had 20 acres to work on. Listen to him talk big! Use your brains, dear. Who says you cannot save as a farmer? You just need to be patient. Be patient and you can save good. Take me for example. Look at what I have done after I started farming. I got my sister married. I got myself married. I built myself a house. We have a car and a tractor. We don't owe anyone a single penny. You cannot do farming if you gel your hair.. ..and leave on the bike early in the morning and return at night. You need to toil in the field. You have to work hard for your own good. No one can make it work for you. For a Jatt land is like his mother. And a mother never lets her son go hungry. - Look son.. - Fine. But at least discuss about it. You will never let us talk man-to-man. You interfere even before I start talking. It's okay, mother. Let it be. If I am destined to be a farmer then that's what I'll be. Satisfied? Are you happy now? You are always criticizing him. He got upset. Are you happy now? You wasted 100,000 rupees. First Chandigarh and then Delhi. You don't get visas so easily. She didn't clear it. Tell me which country's visa will she get with 5 bands? She is inauspicious little brat. Roop! Mind your language! You say things without giving it a thought. She is my only daughter. And I have brought her up like a son. The whole village keeps praising her. If you have issues with her then you should have one child of your own. It is my fault that I cannot have children? Did I ask God.. to keep me childless? I always keep questioning Him.. Why didn't have a child of my own? I have to spend my day looking at this cursed girl. You too go to Canada. Try running after the plane. Sit down, my child. Look dear, you don't need to worry because you scored low. This doesn't mean the end of life. Don't be disheartened. I'll find you a job here itself. Whatever you want. Right. That's like a good girl. Dear.. The shopkeeper gave me your result. Don't worry. Hello? Yes, you called? Why didn't you answer? I was being censured by my parents. Scolded? What did you do now? Dad had gone to the city to get my result. I only got five bands. Just five? That's nothing. Yes, it's nothing. How many did you get? I.. I got 5.5 bands. Don't you feel ashamed? This was your third attempt. And you still scored just that much? This was my first attempt. Where's your attitude now? Not you too. Father has already reprimanded me. I am going to till the fields. Oh, Jatt Sahib actually works on the fields too? Fine, bye. I am getting late. I need to go my fields. Fine. Okay. How are you doing, Mr. Canada? How are you doing, uncle? How's your son doing in America? Is he doing farming over there? When Mr. Canada can do farming over here why can't Mr. America do it? Wait there, I am coming. Stop joking. When I go to Canada, I'll put in a word about you. I'll make sure that you get transferred with my reference. I'll get you transferred to Andaman Nicobar islands. You can keep distributing letters over there. It's time for you to get retired. Don't argue like that. Don't feel angry, nephew. I am trying to reason things out with you. Stop dreaming about going abroad. You have land here. Keep harvesting and keep feeding yourself. Or else you will lose both your dream and your home. Forget it, uncle. And keep your advice to yourself. - Got it? - What's this? I just purchased that newspaper for three rupees. I still haven't read it. This is the compensation for wasting my time. You can waste 40,000 on IELTS. But you cannot spend three to buy a newspaper. Dreaming of castles while living in huts. Get going, uncle. Go distribute letters in the village. Go straight to the village. Making noise for no reason. Manjeet Kaur? Yes? Make some tea for me. Hello? Didn't you hear me? I've working on it. Where? Here, on the gas. My dearest wife.. How many times have I told you.. ..that I cannot digest the food cooked on gas and modern utensils. I have built an open kitchen outside such a big house.. ..because I want my food to smell and taste like Punjab. I cannot eat poison like all of you. Both mother and son always troubling me. Welcome, Jatt Sahib. Have a seat. Tell me what's new. I want to talk to you about something. Tell me. - I want to do IELTS. - What? I want to do IELTS. You have already done your best. It's not your cup of tea. Let it be. I want to do it. You are impossible, rigid just like a dog's tail. You are always scolding him . Hear him out at least. What do you want to say, son? Mother, I want to take another attempt at IELTS. Don't make me angry. Don't make me hurt you. I'll turn you black and blue. You have already tried it. You didn't score well. Will you be giving the test in Punjabi this time? Mother, that was different. Here, read this newspaper. Seven bands, guaranteed. It's on the front page. Fine. Do it then. If you are taking the decision then you'll be the one spending the money. - I don't have a single penny. - Why? You don't have money for us? Why don't you just plaster the money you have left to the walls? You don't want to spend any on your son. Who give him money for the previous attempts? I had. She acts smart. This isn't me acting smart. He is our only son. If he can stand on his own two feet by spending some money.. ..then what is wrong with that? Why do you want to disappoint him? Please don't do that. Let him do it. This is your last attempt. - Okay. - Promise? Okay. But on one condition. If you don't score good this time around.. ..then I don't want you come home. I want to see you in the fields. - I accept your condition. - Me too. Yes. Give him the money I gave you last night. Stick to your word now. I will, father. I will. Goodbye, mother. Thank you! Why am I stuck with such stupid people? How are you doing, uncle? I was in the city. I thought I'd take another attempt at IELTS. Yes, in Patiala. No, I won't forget you. Yes, uncle. I am fine. What is your problem, man? No problem. I was hungry, so I thought I should grab a bite. Why? Is eating when hungry an offence in this country? No eating isn't an offence. But stealing sure is. If you are very hungry then you can always beg for some food on the streets. You are a healthy lot. One packet of snacks won't suffice. Oh, I see. So you think that we are beggars? You don't look like kings either. You don't know us. We are the lion of this jungle. Lion? But you all look like monkeys. And you behave like stray dogs. Go away, Mr. Lion. Wait you, Mr. Smartypants. You worthless piece of shit! Thank you, bro. No worries, bro. Who were these lunatics? Forget them, just beggars. - Okay. - Anyway, Jassi. And who are you? Dhanna. Dhanna Dhakkar from Haryana. A land of milk and cream. What are you doing here then? I'm in Patiala for IELTS to get PR for Canada. - Where are you doing it from? - Best IELTS. A famous institute in Patiala. Right! I had read its advertisement in the newspaper. - Right. - How is that place? - Are they any good? - Amazing institute. They prepare you well. Should I join it? - Yes, sure. - We'll study together. Here, my buddy. Let's celebrate our friendship with something sweet. Well done, Dhakkar Singh. - Let's go. - Let's get you admitted. 'That is Lakhwinder Singh a.k.a. Lakha.' 'The managing director of The Best IELTS institute.' 'He could never go abroad because he scored only 3.5 bands in IELTS.' 'So he opened his own IELTS institute and started making money.' Good morning, sir. Someone's coming. Hello, brother. Hello. Hi. - How are you? - Good. Have a seat. How can I help you? My name is Navdeep. I wanted to talk to you about IELTS. We will talk. What else can we do other than talk? Tell me, what will you have first? Tea or coffee? No, thank you, brother. Then I'll order tea for you. No, thank you, brother. Surjan Singh? Get two cups of tea. Spicy tea. I like my talks and my tea to be spicy. So, tell me. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, son. IELTS tests? Don't worry, you will fare well. I have told you want to expect in the test. Give the test. Don't worry. If you still don't score well, I'll talk to the superintendent. I am in direct contact with him. Fine, all the best. I don't let any of my clients misfire. - What did you say your name is? - Navdeep Singh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes. - Where are you from? - Sodhiwala. Get the tea here, Surjan Singh. Keep it here. Sodhiwala, heard it's a beautiful place. Yes, thank you. I think you have named it. Where is it? - It is close to Sumana. - Sumana? Okay. I have sent many people from Sumana abroad. I am the reason behind Sumana being empty. Really? Have your tea. Excuse me. Yes? Yes, Jinder, how are you? Oh really? You got 8 bands? You got 8 bands. That's great. You will soon be listening to the wedding band too. No, I didn't do anything great. It's God's doing. I am just a medium. Anyway, congratulations. I'll come to eat sweets in the evening. Okay. He got eight bands. What information did you want about IELTS? Brother, we have a huge fair in our village. And I am here to collect donation. So tell me, how much would you like to donate? Keep the tea down. - Keep it back! - What? Look at him enjoying the tea. That tea costs us 12 rupees. Stand up. We are not serving free tea here. He is here for donation. Don't get thrashed instead of getting donations. Get lost. Go away. I wonder where do these freeloaders come from! Surjan Singh! Take this tea back. Add some to it and serve it to someone else. Idiots. He is trying to bluff me after drinking my spicy tea. More clients. Get ready. Hello, sir. Hello, hi. Please have a seat. No, wait. Keep standing. How can I help you? We wanted to talk to you about IELTS. Do you want to just talk about it or do you want to do IELTS. Brother, we are here because we want to do it. Have a seat, then you can have a seat. - Okay. - Yes. Have a seat, please. - Is everything alright? - All good. He is my friend, sir. He wants to join your IELTS institute. - Yes. - Oh okay. - He does look like your friend. - Right. That's why I was being strict in the beginning. Kids these days waste a lot of time. Theirs as well as ours. So tell me, what will you drink and eat? Nothing brother, thank you so much. Take whatever he offers. He won't get anything to eat. He will only offer you tea. He's very close to us. He is special. Right. Get us some coffee then, brother. - Yes. - We will have some coffee. - It's not a big deal. - Surjan Singh.. Get three cups of coffee, please. Spicy coffee. - I add spices even in buttermilk. - Okay. - So.. - Yes. Now tell me, where are you from? Lachkani. Now he will get a phone call. Tell him everything. He's very close to us. - It is on Pathshah Road. - Which road? - Pathshah Road. - Okay. - Yes. - Now this is what will happen next. Are you some kind of an oracle? Phone.. - Answer it. - That's great. Yes, Harish? How are you? So you got your IELTS's result? How much did you score? Oh great. 8.5 bands? Did you leave any band for others? Or have you taken all the bands for yourself? No, congratulations to you. Who am I to do anything? It's God who does everything. Fine. No, it's okay. It's just to celebrate the occasion. You can get anything. Yes, okay. Okay, Harish. See you in the office. Here's your coffee. He will get another phone call now. Are you a seer? It was the same trick that was used when I came here for admission. - Oh, I see. - He is a very busy man. He is very famous. Right? Best IELTS, very famous. It's ours. - He knows everything. - Yes, that's true. - Please drink your coffee. - It's with sugar? Please drink your coffee. Oh. It rang. That's great. How did you know? Hello? Who is it? Yes, Parminder. How are you? Have you reached at the test center? What? You think it is tough? Don't worry. Do as much as you can. I will handle the rest. Don't worry. Your superintendent knows me. I will find a solution. You have to do everything for the kids. You cannot help it. Can I make another call? Hello? Coffee. Yes. I have a student. He is at the IELTS test center. You will have to help him. He is finding it difficult. Why do I need to worry when you are here? Here's his number. 749516. Yes, yes, yes. This is his candidate number. Very good. Okay, thank you. So, tell me, what can I do for you? Well, I had seen your advertisement in the newspaper. - Yes. - Yes. These newspaper guys keep printing my advertisements. We don't need to advertise. We already have more students than we can handle. We tell them not to publish any ads. Because newspapers these days run on advertisements. Yes, right. - Anyways, do you wish to do IELTS? - Yes, I do. I have already done it twice. But I don't go beyond 5.5 bands. He is desperate to go abroad. Yes. This is his last chance. - Yes. - Yes. He can go to Canada only if he gets six bands. Canada wants six bands at least. Then you have come to the right place. We will teach you like you teach an illiterate. What? No, don't mind it. You are not illiterate. But we will teach you from the basic level. The way an illiterate is taught. From basic to high levels. - That's how we will teach you. - Yes. We will see what will stop you from being ready for Canada. Brother, what's your fees? How much do I need to pay? That's very important. He is very sharp. We usually charge 8000 rupees per month. If you pay right away, you will get 1000 rupees discount. - You can deposit 7000 rupees right away. - Yes. And it will be 6000 rupees per month henceforth. - Great. - I am not here to make money. I am here to just help the kids. - Thank you, brother. - Thank you, brother. So why delay it. I'll pay the fees right away. - Yes. - And I will start taking the classes from today itself. Great. Very intelligent. - He is very sharp. - Yes, he is. Thank you, brother. Thank you very much, brother. I'm obliged, brother. Stop calling me brother. Look, this is how you say it "Sir". - What? - Sir. - Sir. - Sir. When you go abroad and address a westerner as brother.. ..then he won't understand. - When you will address him as sir, he will be happy. - Great. - How will you say it? - Sir. Look, we have already started teaching him. Do one thing then.. Surjan, take them along and deposit his fees. Give him a book and a pen. He'll start taking classes right away. - Okay. - All the best. - Thank you. - Goodbye. It's very sweet. Now you will enjoy the coffee, Lakhwinder Singh. I am getting a lot of kids because of the newspaper advertisement. That means I need to print more ads. Order away, sir. No orders. I'll be happy if you even just heed to my request. - What is wrong, sir? - What is wrong? I kept pressing the button but the telephone didn't ring. Sir, I checked. Telephone's wires were disconnected. - I have fixed them. - Yes. Fix the wires before I unplug your jobs. Got it? And CCTV is not working either. Camera number three isn't working. I start seeing the client at the last moment. - Fix that. - Yes, sir. Set it right or prepare to set yourself somewhere else. Idiots. Hello, bro. - Al Habibi. - Who? That's hello, in Dubai style, bro. - Okay. - Fine. Thanks for letting us know. Please move a little. Go on, come on. They will teach us now? How are you doing? - Good. - How are you? All good? All good, bro. All good. Wanna go to Canada? Very good, very good, very good. I have to say people from Dubai have a great pull. Take you for example. There were so many empty benches. But you came to me. Please don't mind.. Out of all in the class, we felt you were the only who is rustic. - And one rustic always gets pulled towards another. - Right. That's why we got pulled towards you. What makes you think that I am rustic? I have worn branded clothes, like the citiyites, brought from Dubai. Explain. Don't matter if your clothes are from Dubai. Your face shows that you are a rustic. I mean no matter how expensive our clothes are.. - ..our face shows that we hail from a village. - From a village! You are right. Let's shake hands on that. - Here you go. - We are friends now. Done. - Okay? - I am Jassi. - Missing something? - That's my friend. - Dhanna. Dhanna Dhakkar from Haryana. A land of milk and cream. I am Satnam a.k.a Satta. Satta, you seem mature enough. Why IELTS? I mean you don't look like a student anymore. So what made you go for IELTS? Actually, I used to work as a driver in Dubai. Now I want to be a driver in Canada. I need six bands. And that's why I am here. That's great, Satta. Then you have company. We will book our plane tickets together as well. I am applying for a student visa. You will get PR. This is my third attempt. I hope I make it this time. Then you are my senior. No, bro. I have just given the test twice. But it never made any sense to me. Hello? Greetings, mother. - His mother is calling him. - I am good. I have reached Patiala. I am studying well. Hello to her. - Yes, mother. - It's my friend Jassi. He said hello. - Lord Almighty. Mother, you just sent two knickers. I had asked for three. I have got only two. Now I don't know what to wash and what to wear. Okay, mother. I am attending a lecture at the moment. Send fresh jaggery when father comes. - Sugarcane too. - Send sugarcanes too for Jassi. Okay. Mother, I'll call you after the class. Okay. That was my mother. Why are you so worried, bro? Cat caught your tongue? Did your buffalo run away? Don't say anything about my sister. I don't even let my father curse my sister. Not sister, he meant buffalo. He meant bison. Wife of bull. He is brainless. You look troubled. You should dry your knickers inside. It can rain anytime. You know the weather is bad these days. What? You have come to Punjab from Haryana to do IELTS? No. I have come to dry my knickers. Can only people from Punjab do IELTS? - Can't people from Haryana do it? - They can. They were propagating about this institute so much.. ..that I too decided to do IELTS. Tell me something. You have come from Dubai. Is the Best Institute advertising in Dubai as well? - Yeah? - No, brother. I was a driver over here. Now I have come to India to do IELTS. Okay. So you are driver here as well. - Professor isn't here as yet? - I'll move. - Sir is here. - Hello, students. - Very good, very good. - Good morning, sir. Have a seat, everyone. Very good, very good. Thank you, sir. I am happy to see you having fun here. Now you need to go to Canada and create havoc there. Okay sir. They should know that Punjabis have landed! So students, first of all I wish to congratulate all of you.. ..for taking admission in the Best coaching center in India. No one in India can coach like we do. Let me tell you what IELTS means first. IELTS means English. It has no Hindi or Punjabi, no Maths or Science and no social studies. You need to only learn English. And it is divided into four parts. Writing. Speaking. Reading. - And.. - Listening. Listening! - I think you have attempted before, right? - Yes, sir. Good. These westerners are very clever. They have put it in four parts. They knew that if they kept only one test in English.. ..then Punjabis would clear it easily. Then all of them would migrate to Canada, America, England, Australia. You are right. But we are going clear all the four tests. We will prove it to them that even they have 400 tests.. ..we will still manage to clear them. And that's because you are in the Best coaching center. Great. Look, we aim to build your base in English. - Yes. - Got it? Yes, sir. To build a foundation. Your teacher will come from tomorrow. She will build that foundation brick by brick. As soon as the structure stands, you'll find yourself standing in Canada. - Okay? - Yes, sir. Now if any student has any questions then they can ask me. Yes? Sir, I want to know can we use Punjabi in exam paper? No. Wrong. Today is our Punjabi day. On Mondays, we talk only in Punjab. There are seven days in a week. Sunday is a holiday. Out of the six days left five days we will talk in English. But we have kept one day for our mother tongue, Punjabi. If we don't keep aside even a single day for Punjabi.. ..then tell me, how will Punjabi feel? So on Mondays we will only talk in Punjabi. So tomorrow, if I enter your class, you can ask me questions in English. I will answer them quickly. Today, you will ask everything in Punjabi. - Okay? - Okay, sir. Sir, I asked, can we answer the IELTS paper in Punjabi instead of English? Look, you should answer's IELTS test in English. But if you don't know English.. ..or if you don't understand what they are asking.. ..then you shouldn't leave the test paper empty. Fill all the pages in Punjabi. If you attempt the full test then maybe the examiner might get emotional.. ..over the hard work you have put in and give you more marks. Doesn't that make a difference? - Okay? - Okay, sir. Sit down. Students, if anyone else has a question then they can ask me. Yes, tell me. Sir, my mother had called. She was asking what IELTS is. So sir, what is the full form of IELTS? I can tell you. It's not a big deal. What is the full form of IELTS? But today we are celebrating Punjabi today. - Yes. - Hence, I cannot talk in English. Hence, I cannot let you know. Tomorrow, either I will let you know or the other madam.. ..who is expected to tomorrow will let you know the full form of IELTS. - Okay? - Yes, sir. - You got the answer? Then have a seat. - Yes. Okay then, students. I think it is time for you all to leave now. I'll leave first then you can leave. Bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye, sir. Bye. - Jassi, are you busy? - No. Why? Let's party to celebrate our friendship. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go, hurry up. - Come on, everyone. Go home, people. That's all for today. "Still, keep them coming.." "Still, keep them coming.." "Call all your buddies.." "Get blitzed, without any worries." "Still, keep them coming.." "Call all your buddies.." "Get blitzed, without any worries."

I don't think you want to go home." "He is so useless." "He's lying on the floor, after a drunken stupor." "He'll wake up to a hangover. He has had too much to drink." "They never mend their ways. They never come back." "They aren't good people." "Still, keep them coming.." "Still, keep them coming.." "Wild boys get together every Sunday.." "Still, keep them coming.." I am getting old now. I cannot see clearly either. Find someone who can fix your buttons for you. Okay? How many times have I told you? But you are adamant about going abroad. This is the time when you should get married. Look at the way my mother is glowing. She says she is getting old. It is my father who is old. - He fights with me over everything. - Really? - You are still quite young, mother. - Oh really? And you are just looking for excuses to get out of this work. Naughty. He is joking with his mother. Get lost! Bye, I'll get going then. God bless you, son. I want my son to get married soon. I want him to have 5-7 children. I want them to play in the courtyard. I will sing and dance. "My courtyard is filled with auspicious laughter.." Ouch, the needle pricked me. Keep walking, straight to Canada.. Keep walking.. Your plane is here! - Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. - Your plane is here! Your plane is here! - I will hit all of you! Go away! - Your plane is here! Your plane is here! - Go away! - I'll hit you. - I'll hit you. - Throw it. Let go of the stone. Let go of the stone. These people don't let me go to Canada. Tell them to let me go to Canada. I want to go to Canada. My parents are waiting for me over there. Jassi, I will be able to go to Canada, right? Yes, you will. But they don't let me go. Dogs. You will see, I'll crush them under the plane I travel. You just wait and watch. I'll borrow a westerner's gun. I will shoot all of them. Bang! Bang! Bang! I will shoot all of them. Hey! Jassi.. Are you too going to Canada? We both will go together to Canada. - You will go with me? - Don't worry. We will go to Canada together. Look at that.. It is here, the plane to Canada is here. Hey buddy.. bye. I am coming. Go and land it. I am coming. Jassi, did you get the bands? I didn't get any bands. I am going to directly get the visa. Look at that. It is in that plane. Hello. Hello, Mr. Westerner. Land the plane. I am coming. Jassi too is coming. He's right behind me. You will come after I go, won't you? You will come to meet me, won't you? You will, right? Yes, I surely will, Sehma. Jassi and Sehma, going to Canada. Come on, westerners keep walking forward. Keep walking. Jassi and Sehma, going to Canada. Going to Canada. So? Where is Jatt Sahib going all dressed up? To the IELTS center in the city. Why are you standing here? Father is allowing me another attempt at IELTS. Again? Where are you studying this time? You know the blue-mirrored building? On its other side. Okay. Come, I'll drop you. No, you go. I'll take a bus. Hop on, why suffer is tiresome journey in a bus? Hop on. We both are going to the city. Hop on. - No.. - Come on. Sit. "I have dedicated my life to you." "You are all I got." "I have dedicated my life to you." "You are all I got." "You are my God, my love." "You are the reason I am alive, my love." "I have dedicated my life to you." "You are all I got." "I have dedicated my life to you." "You are all I got." "When you, me and our love come together.."

I don't know English at all. I came here to learn the ABCD. Only Lord Shankar can create a miracle. If I manage to go to Canada then it would be great. If I don't, I have a grocery store in the village. I have a 10X10 plot. I will sell it. I will have fun. Peaceful life. Okay. So you have a shop in the village. - Yes. - Then I am sure girls frequently visit the shop. Very beautiful girls. Then why do you want to go to Canada? You will have to go there and take up a job. Settle down here. And be the owner of your shop. As if you will be a king in Canada. You too have to drive a truck. - You will spend 2.5 million to go there. - Yes. Won't it be better if you spend 2.5 million and buy a truck here. Be its owner and its driver. "When I drive, I miss my bride." I swear upon Sapna Chaudhary, you will have fun. No one can win you in telling jokes. How are you, buddy? Go back to your seat. I am good. What's wrong? Why are you so late today? - Go there. How are you? - I am doing good. Excellent. Amazing. I got late because I met a friend on the way. I went to drop her somewhere. - Dhakkar.. - Yes? - Friend. - Amazing. May I come in, sir? Yeah, come in, come in. Damn you. Sorry, sir. - Have a seat. - Thank you, sir. This word sorry was made people like you. Do you know that? One for you didn't show up yesterday. One for coming late today. And one for sneezing. But sir, I had come here yesterday. But I went back as the main gate was closed. Main gate was closed? How is that possible? At what time did you come here? At 7 in the evening, sir. At 7 in the evening? Why did you show up at 7 in the evening? Do we hold classes during the day or night? Oh no. This is what I wondered at home, sir. I thought Nimmi, it's possible that sir wants you there at 7 in the morning. That's why I came here today. Thank God, you gave it a thought at home. By the way, you aren't on time today either. You are late. Sorry, sir. Actually, you know what happened? I work up really early in the morning, sir. But you know what happened? There was a power cut. And you know how difficult it is to work in a power cut, sir. And then I started cooking breakfast, sir. But the gas got over. And then I had only bread for my breakfast. And then when I came running down the stairs, I took a rickshaw. But the rickshaw got punctured on the way, sir. And then I took another rickshaw. And that driver was so bad, so bad... Wait... wait a minute. Who is working here? You or the rickshaw driver? Tell me. I got late because of the rickshaw driver. Sorry, sir. How many times will you say sorry? For what all will you say sorry? This isn't about saying sorry. You know you just got a job as a teacher. I had to cancel my meetings and teach the students myself yesterday. It was your job and I had to do it. This is not something good you know. Sorry, sir. This will never happen again, sir. Please, sir. I am sorry, sir. This will never happen again, sir. Please, sir. Please! - Please, sir. Please! - Enough! Women always have sorry and please to fall back to. Even if they kill someone, judge too.. ..pardons half their punishment when they say sorry and please. Your sorry and please is making me crazy. Anyways, forget it. I'll take you to your class. Start teaching the students from today. Let's go. - Yes, sir. - And one thing. You have to be affectionate to the students. Our center is running because of them. Okay? - Yes, sir. - Ladies first. Now I know that you will be affectionate to the students. - Sir.. - Yes? - Shall we go to the class? - Yes, of course. Let's go. - Hello, students. - Good morning, sir. Very good morning. Have a seat, everyone. - Thank you, sir. - So 8o8? Yes, sir. I mean everyone's comfortable? 8o8 in English. Come, come, come. Come forward. She is Nimmi ma'am. - Your new teacher. - Hello, ma'am. Hello. She will be teaching you from today. Okay? - Okay? - Okay, sir. So ma'am, take charge. I'll get going now. - Excuse me, sir. - Thank you, sir. Sir, why don't you take today's class? It is easier to understand you. Madam will anyway be teaching us for the rest of the month. Me? How do I tell you that I had only scored 3.5 bands in IELTS? Today it's Monday either. But I will have to teach them as I take fees from them. Okay. I will teach you. Okay? Okay, sir. I'll wait outside then. No, no, no. You don't need to leave. We both will teach them. If two teachers teach them then it will learn twice as much in one class. - Okay, sir. - Double benefit. Yes. Okay, let's talk about English. - English was divided into four segments. - Yes. First two parts is speaking and.. - Reading. - Oh yes. Reading. Speaking and reading... Now I want Nimmi ma'am to tell you about speaking and reading in more detail. All yours. Thank you, sir. - Hello, students. - Hello, ma'am. I am Nimmi. And I am here to teach you all how to clear your IELTS exam. And I know you all must be very scared. Because you do not know English. But don't worry. You don't have to worry about the bands. Forget the bands. What you have to do is, fall in love with English. Because, if you love English then English will also love you. Like Mr. Bachchan said.. You can eat English. You can drink English. You can sleep English, talk English, walk English. But you know what I say? You can also dream English. So don't worry and be happy. We will start our class from tomorrow. - Okay? - Okay, ma'am. - So.. see how good she is? - Yes, sir. Love English. I am sure you know what love means. You guys are very naughty. Fine then if any student has any question then they can ask me. Or I will leave. - Yes, sir. - Oh yes, go ahead. Good morning, sir. First of all my question is.. ..what is the total length of all this testing examination center? What does that mean? That's a tough question. I can answer that. But I won't. I want one of you students to answer that. By the way, that is a very nice question. You will surely get somewhere between 6-8 bands. You can have it in writing from me. If one of you answers it then I will know how good you are. How well did you answer it. So we will guess how many bands will you get. Who will answer it then? Oh yes. Jassi, answer it. Sir, she asked what will be the total time limit to take all the tests. As I have already attempted them, according to me.. ..it take around eight hours or so. 'Okay, so that was the question she asked.' Okay. This is what she has asked. First of all, it was difficult question to understand. - You understood it. Sit. It's okay. - Okay. Okay, sir. Now, I will explain the answer he just gave. You will be giving four tests in all. Three tests of two and a half hours each. And one test of half an hour. - Okay? - Right. - Very intelligent. Have a seat. - Thank you, sir. So does anyone else have any questions? Sir, how many countries you have visited till now? There are many countries in this world. There are so many countries that one never runs out of them. I mean many countries. They are very beautiful countries. Canada too is a very beautiful country. It is like another Punjab. Yes. Sit down. Brother, which countries have you been to? I.. I don't think there is any country I haven't been to. - That's great. - I have filled 4-5 passports so far. My passports have more stamps that people have photos in their wedding album. - Okay? - Okay, sir. - Thank you, students. Take care. - Bye! - Let's go and have coffee in my office? - Sure. Let's go. - Bye-bye. - Bye, sir. Careful. What is happening, bro? - Let her go. - Let her go. She didn't fall as much as you are falling for her. Sit down. - Canada! - Bye! How was the introduction, sir? First of all, change your sandals. It keeps slipping. Why? What happened, sir? Why did you have to be so affectionate towards him? Sir, you only told me that I have to be good to the students, sir. I was just trying to be friendly with them.. ..sir, so that they can understand what I am trying to tell them, teach them. Okay. Wait. We will talk in English only in the class. Here we will only talk in our mother tongue, Punjabi. - Okay? - Okay, sir. I mean, okay sir. Sir, you only told me that I have to be affectionate to the students. I told you to be affectionate, not fall in love. What do you mean, sir? I mean, from tomorrow I will take the class. You may leave. Okay, sir. Can I go, sir? Wait! Hello! Come here. You shouldn't take me so seriously. I didn't say it from my heart. I said it in my anger. Okay, sir. You will take the class. - Okay, sir. - But you should be careful. Especially while slipping. Only slip when I am close by. - What do you mean, sir? - I mean.. - This. - Oh. Okay, sir. Fine, sir. - Can I leave, sir? - Bye. Bye, sir. Thank you, sir. See you, sir. English is troublesome. I would have fired her if I were any good in English. I have another problem about teaching IELTS. I wish I too get a visa of a foreign country. I will go there and do an English-speaking course. Then Lakha won't praise anyone. You are back, son? Yes, mother. I seek your blessings. Should I get you some water? No, you keep doing your stuff. I am not thirsty. Mother, I wanted to talk about something. What is it, son? Tell me. - Mother, I met someone in the city. - Okay. He said he would take me to America illegally. He said I would have his men guiding me all the way. They won't let me face any difficulties. Once I cross the Mexico border then there is nothing to worry about. What do you suggest? No, son. You said this today, but never talk about it again. We are not that greedy for money that we leave our son alone in the sea. This sea of America and Canada has drowned many sons. You should study hard, son. If you get the right score then you can go abroad. And it's okay if you don't score well. We will help you set up a business right here. Whatever my mother says. God bless you. Mother, this is an international number. Answer it. Who knows God is helping us? Hello? God Almighty, have mercy. Please have mercy. Hello, is that Jassi? Yes, it's Jassi. Hello. It's me, Harry. We were together in high school. Harry? In high school? Oh wonderful. What made you think of me today? Well, I was busy working so.. You are calling from an international number. Yes, I am in Canada. Canada? You? You were worse than me. I think you went there illegally. - Well brother, I just got lucky. - How? I got married after high school, to someone known to my family. She was a resident of Canada. We had a quick wedding. I too went to Canada with her. Now both of us go to work and earn in dollars. That's is great, bro. - You should worship your wife. - Right. - You know even Lucky is in Canada. - Lucky? He was worse than all of us. How did he end up in Canada? Yes, he was stupid. He first sent his wife abroad. On study base. And he then followed her. Now both of them go to work.. ..and earn an equivalent of 200,000 rupees per month. Right. - Jassi? - "IELTS v/s Jatt!" - Hello? - "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "IELTS v/s Jatt!" "IELTS v/s Jatt!" What is wrong? Don't you need to go the classes today? - No. - Why? I don't want to do IELTS. What? I will marry a girl who got 6.5 bands.. ..take a spouse visa and go to Canada. Who will let an educated girl marry you, an illiterate? Let me finish. Stop it! Don't make me hit you, Jassi. Behave. Give the test and go wherever you want. Let me finish. Stop it! Don't make me hit you, Jassi. Behave and just do as I say. You start scolding me even before I finish talking. Harry from the neighboring village.. ..married a girl who had 6.5 bands and went abroad. He is making big money there. He called me from Canada yesterday. From Canada! The worse part is that the IELTS test is in English. If it has been in Punjabi then Jassi would have scored well. At least hear him out. Who knows, he might be right. You seem more eager than him. Shouldn't I marry you to a Canadian instead? You can ask your family then to follow you. Stupid, who'll agree to marry their educated daughter to him? He never even passed from the front of a school. Someone will marry their educated daughter to him. There is fat not just on your body but on your brain as well. You won't understand. I was slim when I got married. - He.. - This is what happened to after I got married to you. Because of working. Stupid! Tell your mother.. ..that a woman slims down if she works and does not become fat. Get this straight, Jassi. I won't invest in a stranger. Nor do I have to money to invest. You had to waste a few lakhs and you have already done so. I don't care whether you give the test or you don't. I don't care if you pass or fail. I don't care whether you go abroad or not. But I won't give you a single penny more. - Why was I to get a stupid family? - Father.. - At least finish your food. - Forget the food. Mother, were you really slim and trim? Get lost. You made your father angry. Move aside. I am trapped between you two. I don't care. I want to go to Canada at any cost. He is right as well. Which parent will invest money on a stranger? You study hard. You will get good result. You will see that God will bless you. You too, mother? Don't call out for me. Listen to me. Jassi! Hey Jassi! What are you doing here? I had gone to your house. When did you come back to India? You must be tired. Are you hungry? Here, have a bite. - Take it. - Leave, Sehma. Why are you so angry? I know what are you thinking about. You are thinking about going to Canada, right? You won't be able to go. You know those westerners are very smart. They will send you back. Wait, I'll connect you to them. Wait. See, I have a mobile phone. My mother has sent it. It's an Apple. Hello? How.. No signal. Wait. Found the signal. Hello? Clinton, I want to talk to Bush. Okay. Okay. You are wrong. You sent my friend Jassi back. What? Okay. I'll send you, Jassi. You receive it. Here, talk to him. - Jassi, here, talk to him. - Stop this nonsense, Sehma. Come here. Sit here. Come here, Sehma. Listen to me. Stop doing this. You were with me in school. We have played together. When all the villagers address you as mental, crazy.. I feel very bad. Crazy? Who is crazy? You know who is addressed as crazy? The one who doesn't understand some things. That person is crazy. And the one who doesn't understand anything is called insane. These westerners are insane. I'll shoot everyone with my gun. I feel very scared when I look at you, Sehma. No! Jassi, we won't feel scared. We will fight back. We will get your passport stamped with a visa. Don't you want a visa? You do, don't you? - Yeah? - Yes, I do. - Yes. - But on one condition. What? Tell me. You will behave yourself. You won't act like Sehma anymore. You will behave like my childhood friend Tarseem. You should be like Tarseem Singh for all the villagers. Do you agree? Tarseem? Yes. My friend, Tarseem. Tarseem. These villagers never address me with that name. My mother used to. She used to say, Tarseem.. If you go abroad, we might die waiting for you. Mother is gone too. She left me. I don't have anyone. Don't cry, Sehma. You are making me cry, man. Don't worry, Tarseem. Your friend Jassi is here for you. I am right here. Don't worry. - Tarseem's friend, Jassi? - Yes. - Jassi's friend, Tarseem? - Yes. Tarseem's friend, Jassi! We'll teach these westerners a lesson! The plane is here. Bye, Mr. Westerner! Jassi! I found my childhood friend, Jassi! I won't come with you. Go back. Go back. Stay here. I'll call him. Mr. Westerner, stop. Walk! Go! Go. Go back, go back. Go away. You are great, God. No one knows what You will. Jassi? Jassi! Jassi? Jassi! Jassi.. Got you. Oh God! Jassi! Jassi! Jassi! I am ruined! I am doomed! - Why didn't I die before I saw this! - Mother! - Mother! - Oh God! Is this why I gave birth to you? What is this nonsense, mother? Why did you become so weak? What such happened that you couldn't talk to your mother about? I want to go to Canada. I cannot stay in this village. Now you like Canada more than your mother? It is not so, mother. You should somehow convince father. I won't ask for anything else. I want to go to Canada. Fine. Fine! I'll talk to your father. I'll talk to him. What are you doing here? You are back? I was waiting for you. What do we do about Jassi? What do we have to do about Jassi? If you are talking about that girl then I am not interested. Stop right here. You just say what you have to and leave. You don't have anything else to do. You leave for either the fields or the market. Do you know what happens at home after you leave? Jassi was about drink poison today. He is alive because I was there at the nick of the time. Your son is a great actor. He won't consume poison. You should be happy that he stays at home. He should have been with the theater company. I won't survive if anything happens to him. Get this straight. He is young. He is hot-tempered. He is our only child. We anyway have to get him married, right? What is wrong if we can find a girl who has 6.5 bands? How will we find such a girl? He will find one. Or we can talk to my sister. She has fixed so many marriages. He won't be able to. You can talk to her. You can go meet her if you find someone. I'll go with you when you fix the match. If you say, can I tell Jassi? Tell him. Thank you. Get me some water. - Jassi! - Yes, mother? Jassi, your father agreed.. - What? - ..to get you married to 6.5 bands girl. - Really? Thank you, mother. - Yes. - Are you lying? - No, I am not. Okay, that's enough. I'll talk to your aunt. I'll find you a match. - Hello? - Hello, who is it? It's me, Jassi. You didn't save my number? Okay brother, how are you? You didn't attend the class today. I hope everything is fine. I am good. We will have a party at the pumping station in the evening. I'm very happy today. Tell your parents that you'll be with me tonight. Party? That's great. What's the occasion? No, no, no. I'll tell you the good news at the pumping station. Where are you? I am still at the IELTS center. IELTS center? At this hour? But the class got over long back. No, brother. I had to deposit the fees. That's why I am a little late. Okay fine. Go your thing. Call Dhakkar as well. Both of you can come together in the evening. We will get drunk today. Don't worry, brother. Dhakkar is with me. Get ready. We are coming. Jassi is having a party. We have to go to the pumping station. - Madam is looking so hot! - Hot! - She is your sister-in-law. Look down. - Oh, I see. You will betray your friend for a girl? Everything's fair in love and war for Dhakkar. She is here. - Excuse me? - Yes. You guys are still hanging around? I mean you still haven't left? Your class got over long back. - Madam! - Yes. You are looking very beautiful today. He said so. Mr. Dhakkar. - Thank you. - Yes. But why didn't you leave? Madam, we were waiting to meet you. Now that I have met you, I'll be at peace. Are you kind of trying to flirt with me? What? I mean to say that are you trying to flirt with me? No, I am not flirting. I am just sharing my feelings. Okay. - Madam! - Yes? You spend a lot of time in Mr. Lakha's office. Was it something important? Yeah. Sir started discussion some old issues. That's why it took a long time. 'This old man is a pervert.' Did you say something? No, I said that you are looking very smart. He said so. Why? What is so special about me? Don't say that, madam. My heart races. Everything about you is special. You are looking very smart. That's why didn't wash my knickers.. my clothes. I came to meet you instead. I brought something for you. I hope you won't mind. Oh wow! Chocolate! Thank you. Thank you so much. You don't need to thank me, madam. You should just always be happy. Okay. Fine. Can I go now? Actually, it's time to teach the second batch. Bye. Nice talking to you. - My pleasure. - Yeah. Okay. Bye. - Bye. - See you. - Take care. - Oh my pleasure. Scoundrel! You don't have money to buy new knickers. But you have money to buy expensive chocolates for her. I don't think your intentions are good. Everything's fair in love and war for Dhakkar. Forget it. I am crazy about madam. Bro, we are on to the second bottle. We still don't know what we are celebrating. At least tell us what the good news is. Have another drink first. Then I'll tell you the good news. We are on the second bottle. In some time, we won't know who said what and to whom. Tell us right now. I am going to Canada. On which bus? No bus goes there. How did this happen? Strange. Scoundrel you behave as if I am going to the moon. Going to the moon is okay, but Canada? It is the truth. How did you get this opportunity? Is it not an opportunity, it is a well thought plan. Brother, we are good friends. Tell us your plan. What's your plan? Dhanna Dhakkar from Haryana. A land of milk and cream. I will use Jassi's plan then fly to Canada. All say long live Canada! Live long! You will have milk and cream in Canada too. - Yes. - Then why not have it here? Let Dhanna Dhakkar go to Canada. Then see what I do. There's the plane. I'll be on that plane.. It's Indian. Come back. It's Indian. The plane is here. The plane is here. The plane.. It's him! Jassi, he's the one! He is the westerner who took my passport. - He took my visa. - Tarseem! - Give me my visa. Give it back. - Tarseem! Give it back. Give me my passport. I have just two knickers. You can keep one and leave one for me. Tarseem, we are discussing something important. Please leave. Important? No, these people do dirty things. They steal visas, passports. Give me back my visa. Give me back my passport. - Give it back.. - Brother.. Tarseem, I will get your passport back. Be a good boy and leave. I'll get it back. - You promise? - I do. He has it. He took it. - Leave. - Tarseem! - Give it back! - Tarseem! Bloody thief! Where's my plane? - Wait, I'm coming. - Behave, brother. What was that, brother? Where does he work? Nothing. He was filthy rich. He doesn't own shit now. He fell into the hands of a wrong agent when going abroad. He sent him to some jungle instead of Canada. They made him half-crazy by giving him electric shocks. His parents passed away in the village. When he returned after 5 years.. He lost his mind completely when he saw that he'd lost everything. You were talking about your plan. So what's your plan? So here's my plan. I have found a girl. - She has 6.5 bands. - Okay. Is it a girl or a radio? She is your sister-in-law. Got it? No need to do any IELTS or any other nonsense. I'll go straight to Canada. Jatt Sahib will go straight to.. - Canada. - Amazing. Amazing. Love you, brother. Where have you been? You didn't come home last night. Your phone was also switched off. I was at the pumping station last night. I felt sleepy there. So slept there. Our aunt has found a match. We need to go meet the girl. Hurry up. I have convinced your father with great difficulty. I don't want him to change his mind now. - Get ready. - I'll go and get ready. Hurry up. I will burn his mobile phone some day. Just wait for Diwali. Think about it again. It is odd to meet a girl and leave without saying yes to her. My sister has found the match. She is related to you as well. Sorry. She will show us the girl and you will give your consent. Jassi! Jassi! I'll go and check on him. Where is this idiot? She is educated, brother. She has a degree in arts. She can do all the household work. - Have you done IELTS? - No. - Have you given the English exam? - Yes. - How many bands did you get? - 5.5 bands. - Have you done IELTS? - Yes. What's your marks? Not marks, bands. 6.5 bands. Great. Have some. - Hello, father. - Hello, dear. Hello! You should come home on time for dinner at least. Okay, I am here now. Please eat. I have good news. Good news? What's good in this world anyway? Why are you always so cruel? Roop, tell me, what do you lack in? I lack oxygen. I can't breathe in this house. A house which has a daughter like Kiran is always fragrant. Roop, stop being so rude. Kiran, tell me, how's you preparation for IELTS going? It is going well, daddy. You tell me, what was the good news you wanted to share? Oh yes, dear. You know Jassi, from our neighborhood? He got engaged. But I don't understand one thing. What was the hurry to get him married? I heard that the girl is from a poor family. And that girl is from a different caste. Anyway, it is good. At least he will settle down. But I don't understand. Why do all the kids want to go abroad, to Canada and America? Tell me something, how does it concern us? He can marry anyone he wants. He can go to hell for all I care. You know kids these days will do anything to go abroad. Roop, come to the city with me one day. Stitch a nice dress. We have to attend his wedding. You have never offered to buy me a new dress before. Fine. Keep quiet and finish your dinner. At least finish your dinner, dear. You father and daughter have it. You are always causing trouble. Get lost. This is how they will always be. Who will stay hungry for them? Go. "I think all the stars in the sky have broken." "All those who were close to me are upset." "I think all the stars in the sky have broken." "All those who were close to me are upset." "I keep talking." "I keep sighing." "I keep talking." "I keep sighing." "I am dying out here." "Oh my beloved.." "Why don't you keep your promises?" "I am dying out here." "Oh my beloved.." "Why don't you keep your promises?" "Why don't you keep your promises?" "God should do something such that, the one you like should leave you." "Then I shall ask you." "You too should fight before going to bed." "A few tears you too should shed." "You should get burdened with worries." "Then I shall ask you." "When your dreams will shatter.." "You will taste your tears." "I am dying out here." "Oh my beloved.." "Why don't you keep your promises?" "I am dying out here." "Oh my beloved.." "Why don't you keep your promises?" "Why don't you keep your promises?" "Tell me what crime did my eyes commit by looking at you?" "Once you entered my heart, there wasn't any place left for God either." "Tell me what crime did my eyes commit by looking at you?" "Once you entered my heart, there wasn't any place left for God either." "I cannot tolerate this anymore." "Your memories haunt me." "I am dying out here." "Oh my beloved.." "Why don't you keep your promises?" "I am dying out here." "Oh my beloved.." "Why don't you keep your promises?" "Why don't you keep your promises?" How beautiful is Canada's visa. Excuse me? I mean you look so beautiful. We will soon be sending you to Canada. Don't worry about the money. I'll send you with some money so you can handle a month's expense. You know it gets difficult for the family to help any further. And my father is always scolding me. And yes, I found out that a wife can call her husband after three months. You should call me there after three months. You know no one likes to leave behind their family, their village. They worry who will take care of them there. Right? You can call me there. I'll go to Canada to be with you. You should keep studying hard. - Don't worry about anything. - Okay. I'll work and pay your fees. Okay? And you know, you need to pay in dollars for everything. So try to spend less. Because the more we save the better it will be for our future. Right? My friend Lakha, he is an agent. He will get it done for cheap for us. You should give me your documents in the morning. We will go there together and apply. Okay? Okay? I think you are sleepy. We will go and meet Lakha tomorrow then. Okay? I'll go to sleep now. You too look sleepy. Let's sleep. Okay? Hello? I still need to go to Canada! Hello! She is breathing. I think she's asleep. God, please don't kill her. Or I will get into trouble. Let's go to sleep. Forget the society. Jassi, I hope the plan works. I'll be able to go to Canada. I won't give up. Make me a nice cup of tea now. I am tired clearing the mess caused due to the wedding. I am yet to keep all the beddings aside. Don't worry, sister. Some mess is always expected during a wedding. You got your son married. It is a big deal. Your daughter-in-law will clean everything. You want me to put her to work right away? Let it be. I'll do it. She is going to go to Canada. - Once she goes there, she will invite both you and me. - Yes. I seek your blessings, aunt. God bless you, son. What is wrong? Why are you always in a hurry? - Spend some time with us as well. - Busy with work. - Mother, give me your blessings. - Okay. I'm going to submit your daughter-in-law's file. God bless you, my son. - May God be with you. - Go. Then give me your blessings. Bye, aunt. Continue with conversation then. Make me some tea now. Hello, brother. Hello. How are you, son? - Good. Good. - Have a seat. What is wrong? You left the classes in the middle? What is wrong? - You didn't like our teacher? - No, it is not so. Actually, I changed my plan a little. So I no longer need to do IELTS. Why? What happened? Did you fall in love with your village? Or did you fall in love with someone else? No, I still want to go to Canada. I just used my brains. I got married to a girl who had cleared IELTS. This means you plan to bluff the westerners. No, no bluffing. You just need to help us a little. I need to submit my wife's file. Oh well, you have come to the right place then. I am sure you were very generous in your last birth.. ..because you got to meet Lakhwinder Singh Lakha. Can I see your wife's file? Yes. Here you go. Give it here. Very nice. Wow. Superb. Will it work? Wow! Your wife has scored great marks. Will it work? Consider her visa ready. We just need to collect it. Then collect it. - I am desperate to go to Canada. - I say, we'll go for it. - We'll cause a storm. - There is nothing to worry about. - I just need to confirm it with the embassy first. - Okay. - I need to double check it. - Right. Do one thing. Go out and get these documents scanned. - I'll get it done right away. - Okay. - Please scan these, ma'am. - Okay, sir. Please wait. Mr. Randhawa is the embassy fro me. I don't have any other embassy's number. - Hello? - Hello, brother. Hi! Oh hi! Hello, Lakhwinder Singh! How are you? I needed your little help. No problem, tell me. I am getting a girl's file. She is an art graduate. She scored 70% marks. She has got 6.5 bands in IELTS. There is no gap and she is already married. Should I keep her file? Will she get a visa? Is there a chance? That's great. That's a great file. Such good marks and such great bands. It will work cent percent! 100 percent. That's amazing. Fine then I'll take her file. You get her work done. I'll give you whatever you fees is. I too will be able to make some money out of this. You don't lack of anything, I lack everything. Right? Take her file. 50% from the profit will be yours. And 50% will be mine. That's we will handle. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes! - Here are you copies, sir. - Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. I eat limited stuff so I wonder why there such a high pressure built up. I have to go three times. - I have done it. - Come, come. You are back. - You scanned them? - Yes. Superb. Give that to me, you don't need it anymore. Very nice. Sit down. - I should sit down. - I'll keep these. I have spoken to the guys in the embassy. They said just get the file.. ..and keep your bags ready. They have asked to put some clothes in the bag. Do you know why only some clothes? Because they say you can stop for the rest there. In Canada. Thank you so much, sir. So I'll get the visa after three months? Yes, of course. As soon as your wife reaches there and files the documents.. ..and sends you an invite, you let me know. And then I will start working on your documents. That's great. Thank you so much. Brother, please let me know the expense. We don't want to fight later over money. Everyone fights because of money. There is no other reason to fight. Till the time you don't get visa.. ..you are even ready to sell your house. As soon as you get the visa, it hurts even to tip the postman. Arrange for around 1.5 million rupees. Okay, brother. You submit the file. I'll send the money. Okay. When I leave after three months.. ..I won't have to pay anything then, right? Of course you will have to pay. You'll have to pay to see the fair beauties in the plane. I mean you will only have to pay for the ticket. Okay. You don't have to pay for anything else. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Thank you. - You don't need to thank me. This is your office. You can come here whenever you want. Okay. You just keep the tickets ready. - You can bring along whoever else wants to go abroad. - Okay, sir. - Bye. - Thank you so much, sir. Okay. By the way, you have benefited by attending the classes for IELTS. You have started addressing me as sir instead of brother. Bye. So, where was I playing poker? Your son isn't back yet? He will come. You are still reading the newspaper? - Hello. - There he is. - So what happened to the file? - What else can you expect? Jatt Sahib always gets the work done. You should start packing her back. Father, I met the agent. He said we would need to give 1.5 million. We will have to deposit 750,000 as advance. And the rest can be paid in installments. It's that easy? Why don't you pull up one of your Jatt Sahib tricks? Brother, don't you want to send your son abroad? Do it. Take the half from your aunt. I don't have any money, brother. My children too are sitting idle at home. Here's the name, Lakhwinder Singh. You have to deposit it in this account. I'll deposit it, right. Give it to your mother. Mother, you do something. 1.5 million rupees isn't a small amount. It is very difficult. Anyway, I'll talk to him. - Come in. - Hello, sir. Hello. - How are you? - Very good. - I have brought the documents you had asked for. - Here. Take it. Documents can be handled. We can produce it, if there is any missing. Son, tell me, did you arrange for the money? I have spoken to my father. I'll get the payment cleared by this evening. Yes, get it cleared. - Everything is clear from here. - Okay. I think even before you reach home.. ..I'll give you a call to say that she got the visa. That is great. So, should I leave? - Yes, have fun. Go and start preparing. - Okay. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you, thank you. It's okay. I have the documents. They aren't going anywhere now. Who's next? Oh, Kiranpreet Kaur. How are you? Where are you going? I had some work. You got married and didn't even tell me? I didn't tell you? Why? Didn't you get an invite? I personally gave an invite to your father. - Was the invite enough for me? - Next. Anyway, forget it. I'll get going. I had sent an invite. How are you, boys? What's the progress with your IELTS classes? Jassi, studying isn't my cup of tea. Now I too will marry a girl who has 6.5 bands. And go directly to Canada. Why do I need to worry? My father owns a 10X10 plot. I'll sell it. I'll buy an Enfield motorbike. I swear on Sapna Chaudhary, it will be great fun. Forget it. Why do you want your family to starve? He wants to buy an Enfield.. ..when he doesn't even have the strength to kick-start it. Who will start it for you? - My buddy Atta, I mean Satta.. - Listen! Listen to me, seriously. Don't eye the teacher. Or else Lakha will ban your passports. Do you get it? The high school I was in, I had a classmate. Good for nothing. He flirted with the teacher. He has no standards. What's wrong with that? She is a woman, isn't she? She is a teacher. It doesn't mean she doesn't have any feelings. Actually, she too wants someone to look after her. - Right. - Someone who calls her after every five minutes. - Right. - Shut up. You won't get it. You will learn a lesson when you'll fall in love. Satta, Jatts don't fall in love. And I have already made my move. I just met Lakha. He said Preet's visa is on the way. - And in three months, Jatt Sahib will be in Canada. - Oh great! - We need a party, brother. - This is your party. This is locally distilled. We want the one which is sold at the wine shop. It has pipe on it. I lie to my family that I am watering the fields. And here we are watering our body. You'll get a party in the city too. But you guys will never be satisfied. Hello? Hey! Hello! How are you? Hello brother, how are you? Didn't I tell you that it might take nine months to deliver a child.. ..but it doesn't take us long to deliver a visa. Congratulations. Your wife got a visa. - Really, brother? - Yes. You should send your wife and get ready to follow her soon. I am working on your file. That is great, brother. Book the tickets as well. I'll book the tickets too. It isn't a big deal. You just need to tell me when your wife wishes to leave. And..there was some payment due. Don't worry about the payment at all. Book the earliest ticket possible. It will save us a lot of time. I'll give you the payment in the evening. Okay, I'll book it. Okay, brother. Okay. How are you, Mr. Canada? I am good, uncle. Got the visa. What? Yours? Not mine. My wife's. I will get mine soon. Stop getting me excited then. Why should I dance for a stranger? Son, you shouldn't get so excited for a stranger. I will see when you get a visa. Let my wife leave. Three months after that, I'll too fly away. It's not easy for a blind to ride a horse. Not a horse, I'll fly in an airplane. Nephew, the day you catch a flight.. ..I'll distribute sweets instead of letters. - You will one day. - Fine. It is very beautiful. - This is how it is there. - Nice pictures, aren't they? Yes. So your pictures will also be like this? Yes, it will be just like this. - Great, I'll tell Jassi. - It's beautiful. Yes. - You'll make me see a foreign country. - So.. Oh my! You are looking very happy today. What's the occasion? Guess. How can I guess? - Tell me, what happened? - Try and guess. No, tell me. I cannot guess. She got the visa. What! - It worked out well. - Thank you, God. Manjeet Kaur! I'm going to the city. Do you want something? Come and sit over here. I'll tell you. Have a seat Sit down. - Get a box of sweets. - Why? Why? There's good news. Good news? You? Whenever you open your mouth, I feel that you'll drop a bomb. Not a bomb, an atom bomb. Father.. You should let go of your anger at least sometimes. Preeti got the visa. Don't need to get too excited. Arrange for the rest of the money. We will surely celebrate. Jassi! - Hey! - Let it be. She is here only for a few more days. Let the kids have some fun. You too should have some fun. You are being so romantic today. Ms. Beauty Queen. Hello? It's Lakhwinder. Hi. Hi, Lakhwinder. Hello. Listen, the Canadian visa that we arranged for.. We also need to book a ticket for her. Listen, Mr. Lakhwinder, this is not right. You can use your computer to book it. Take the money from the customer and give the ticket. I cannot wreck my brains over it. I anyway have a small brain. And you know what the problem is? We need to book a ticket for Canada. And I am not so well versed with how to use a computer. I fear that I might book a ticket for Cambodia instead. Okay, okay. No issues. I'll book it and send it to you. No problem. Okay, thank you. - Okay. - Bye. Okay, bye. Bye. Okay, bye. - Take another. - No, thank you. Eat it. Corn bread tastes good greens. Agent called. He has booked the ticket. That's good. God is being kind. Now if you get your visa.. ..your hard work pays off then we too will stop worrying. Don't worry, mother. Pack Preeti's bag. It's my turn next. Tickets are booked for the 15th. Fine. 15th will be here soon. It isn't that far away. - It is close. - Yes. Do you want anything else? I am done. Okay then, I'll wash the utensils. Or else your father will wash me out. He hates dirty utensils. - Come out already. - Coming! There you go. Here dear, take these sweets along. If you feel hungry during the journey. Dear, there are so many restaurants on GT road. There is no shortage of food. If you think, she'll take it in the plane then that seems impossible. Her bags are full. She will have to remove something. They aren't heavy. They will get easily adjusted. She won't find homemade sweets out there. So, are you ready? Have you taken everything? - Yes, mother. I have. - She is ready. - Let's go then. We are getting late. - Bye, auntie. Study well over there, dear. I got you married into an affluent family. And yes, do proper documentation.. ..and keep my honor intact as I had fixed this match. - Bye, father. - God bless you. God bless you, dear. - Girls don't touch feet. - Bye. God bless you. - Bye, mother. - Bye, dear. Goodbye. Let's go now. Make sure she boards safely. Don't worry. If they permit, I'll take her to her seat and also click her picture. Why won't they permit? You tell them that you are her husband. Fine. It's drizzling. And there are dark clouds in the sky. Be careful on the way. Bye, mother. See you. Bye. Bye. - Hold this. Bye, father. - See you. Goodbye. Let's go. We are getting late. Be careful. - Okay, bye. - Bye. Jassi? Yes, mother. How many days has it been since Preeti left for Canada? It's been three months and four days. She hasn't called since quite some time now. You should have called her. I tried, but I couldn't get through. Her Whatsapp is also unavailable. Lift your leg. She must be busy with my documentation. Right. There are so many documents she needs to prepare. Mother, you would've got anything you had asked for today. - Why? - It's your daughter-in-law's call. Oh, I see. Really? Hello? Yes, Preeti? Hello? - Hello? - Hello.. Hello? Good evening, Jassi. How are you, Preeti? It has been so long since you last called. It's not evening. It's morning over here. What's the status of my documents? Things are great here. - Really? - Yes. When should I book the tickets then? Oh my, someone is very happy. Let me finish. I wasn't talking about your tickets. I want you to attempt for IELTS again. Because your dream of coming to Canada with my help.. ..will never get fulfilled. That's because my dear Jassi darling.. ..I am getting married over here. You are getting married? What is this nonsense? Have you lost your mind? We are married. It is not a joke. And my father has spent 1.5 million rupees. Keep your voice down. And the 1.5 million you are talking about.. ..that you spent on me, it wasn't spent on me. You spent it to fulfill your dream of going to Canada. It'd be better to poison myself then to marry into your family. You were thinking only about Canada on our wedding night. I have to work the whole day. Massage aunt's feet, work in the kitchen. You needed a servant and not a daughter-in-law. So, this is my final goodbye to all of you. Bye, Jassi. Preeti! Listen to me! Hello! Hello, Preeti? Wouldn't listen to me! You and your mother ruined me. - Jassi! - Father! - Father! - Jassi! Jassi! Oh, my God! - Father? - What is wrong? Mother! - Father! - Call the doctor, quickly. Call the doctor immediately. Hello? - Doctor? - Hurry up. Yes, take a deep breath. - Lord Almighty. Lord Almighty. - Good. Lord Almighty. Lord Almighty. Once again, a deep breath. I have checked. There is nothing to worry about. He just needs complete rest. - I will go to the clinic and send some medicines. - Okay. - You should start giving him those. - Okay? I have prescribed some medicines. You need to get these from the pharmacy. Okay, doctor. Okay. Get these medicines. You come outside with me. Okay. Come, Chanan Singh. You keep distributing letters all day along. Spend some time with us. Coming. Coming. Let me park the cycle first. Come and sit with us. Coming. Here's my card. - Hello, everyone. - Hello. - Hi! - Sit with us for some time. How is your son? He is good. But man, what happened with Bajjan Singh was wrong. He sold his land to send his daughter-in-law abroad.. ..so that she takes his son with her. She went there and changed. They played their move and she played hers. No, no. Bajjan Singh doesn't play such games. That poor man was helpless. His son was desperate to go abroad. He said he wanted to go to Canada. He wanted to go to Canada at any cost. I heard that last time he had tried to consume poison. I don't know what's wrong with these boys. They all want to go abroad. Punjab is getting ruined because of this. True. Many sons haven't returned home. There is still some hope left. If he learns a lesson, and stays at home.. ..and help his father in farming.. ..then his father will live longer. They should pressurize her family to return the money they had invested. How will they return? They are paupers. She will send them from Canada. She got married in two countries after all. Sister, you? Hello, sister. Hats off to you, mister. What you did with us was not right. I got your daughter married into such an affluent family. And this is how you paid us back? What is wrong? Tell me at least that. What is wrong! As if you don't know. Your daughter remarried in Canada. - What, sister? We don't know anything. - We don't know. This is the first time I am hearing about it from you. She is my daughter. If she has made a mistake then consider her a kid and forgive her. How can we forgive her so easily? What about the money we spent on the money? And those 1.5 million? Pay those 1.5 million rupees and I'll forgive her right away. Sister, we are paupers. We don't have that kind of money. You know about us. Her father passed away after she was born. Her mother passed away when she was nine. We have brought her up after that. But there was no vice in my daughter. She was a very nice girl. She was good in studies. She used to come first in her class. She used to study and teach as well. That's why she had done IELTS. You don't need to do this drama. You thought you would first send your daughter to Canada. And then you will follow her there. You would have fun by spending dollars. I know you are in league with her. Look sister, we sent a decent girl with you. We didn't know she'd change like this after going abroad. Stop this drama. If you had taught her well then she wouldn't have behaved like this. It is all thanks to her corrupted mind. Aunt! Mind your language. If Preeti deceived you, it doesn't mean that all girls are bad. How is it our fault? You send her abroad. You spent money on her. Did you ask us before sending her abroad? And how would we know that she'd change after she goes abroad? Keep quiet, dear. You should behave with manners in front of elders. Sister! We really don't know anything. Still, we apologize to you. Father, why should we apologize to her? If you feel cheated that register a case against her with the police. You don't need to come to our house and trouble us. Otherwise, we might approach the police before you do. We will tell them what all you did to our girl. Fine then. Now police will handle everything. Forget the police..you can even approach the military. Just because father is keeping quiet.. ..it doesn't mean we don't know anything. This is what people like you deserve. Now go look for another girl who had 6.5 bands. Look at the way she argues! Let me tell you one more thing. You shouldn't so greedy that you don't notice your loss. The thief is blaming the cop here? Thief is acting smart here? What.. How did this happen? He is watching all this drama unfold quietly. We brought up your daughter, educated her just so that she ruins our lives? Oh.. oh God! Why are you crying? It's not your fault. Father! "You severed all ties." "Now you don't reply." "My dream was real." "But you weren't considerate." "You severed all ties." "Now you don't reply." "My dream was real." "But you weren't considerate." "I pleaded to you.." "With folded hands." "Tell me, what did you gain?" "What did you gain by breaking my trust?" "Tell me, what did you gain?" "What did you gain by breaking my trust?" "Tell me, what did you gain?" "The fire of separation burnt my heart." "You ruined my life forever." "The fire of separation burnt my heart." "You ruined my life forever." "You broke all the promises you had ever made." "Tell me, what did you gain?" "What did you gain by breaking my trust?" "Tell me, what did you gain?" "What did you gain by breaking my trust?" "Tell me, what did you gain?" "All my dreams shattered like beads." "You have hurt my feelings with your deeds." "You have hurt my feelings with your deeds."

I had come to a Gurudwara. Wonderful. Have you paid your homage already? I did. Then go back inside. Go and thank Lord Almighty. We got a sponsorship for you from Canada. Don't joke. Tell me, how are you doing? Come on now. Joke? I didn't open such a big office to tell jokes. I am not joking, son. We have received a sponsorship for you. My life has already become a joke. Don't joke anymore. Hello? Hello? Stupid boy. Why do you keep calling me and troubling me, brother? My life has become a joke. Please, it's a request. Please don't call me again. Listen to me very carefully. Tell me. I have received a sponsorship for you for Canada. This sponsorship has been sent by a westerner. It has been sent by an old friend of yours, Kiranpreet Kaur. She went to Canada on student visa through me. Take me seriously and prepare to go to Canada, son. Hello? Hello? Jassi? Hello? Hello? How is Jatt Sahib doing? Kiran, you? Yes, you have forgotten me. But I cannot forget my childhood friend now, can I? Is what Lakha said the truth? Yes, it is 100 percent true. Now quickly get ready to come to Canada, Jatt Sahib. Thank you, Lord Almighty. But how did you learn that Preeti cheated me? You know what, when I attempted IELTS for the second time I got 6.5 bands. Lakha I think has contacts in only one college in Canada. He sends all the students to this college. Your wife Preeti too was in this college. I once saw her with another boy. I got a little suspicious. When I started digging for information.. ..I learnt that she got remarried over here. Your wife is very clever. She showed fake documents of divorce to prove that she is divorced. Your wife is indeed very smart. Right. But forget her. But you aren't married to me. How did you manage to sponsor me? Well, you get what you are destined to get. Yes, I couldn't invite you as we aren't married. But my best friend here is a Canadian's son. I told him everything. When I told him about everything his daddy agreed to sponsor you. And I somehow managed to arrange money for your ticket as well. Now you come here quickly. I don't like it here without you. Thank you so much, Kiran. Thank you! Hey, listen! Not don't keep telling about this in the village. Or people will think that we were having an affair. And hence, I invited you as soon as I went there. Did you hear me? Jatt Sahib is coming there. I'll go and give this good news to mother. Fine. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. Stupid girl. Thank you, God. Mother! Oh mother, give me a kiss! Move away! I am going to get a sponsorship letter from Canada. What is that? Visa document. - What? - And a Canadian has sent them! Oh, my God! How do you know him? - Someone asked this Canadian to send them. - Who? - Kiran has sent them through him. - Really? But why did she send them? - Maybe because she likes Jatt Sahib? - Hats off to Jatt Sahib! Hey! Why is Jatt Sahib so happy? I am going to get a sponsorship letter from Canada. Do you know who sent them? A Canadian! A Canadian! I hope you are not high. I too didn't believe it at first. Then Lakha the agent called me. I thought he is lying to me. - Then Kiran called me. - Oh my. - She said come to Canada. - I said, okay. What is it nephew, you sound very happy. - There is a letter for you. - I think I got the visa. - The document to get the visa. - You got the visa? Wait, wait, wait. A Canadian has sent it so it is sealed well. - Read it out aloud for us. - It is in English. - But I'll translate it in Punjabi for you. - Okay. Canadian Government says, dear Mr. Jaswinder a.k.a. Jassi. On behalf of the Canadian Government.. ..we are sending you we are sending you.. ..a sponsorship letter to come to our country. All your lodging boarding and travel expenses.. ..will be borne by the Canadian Government. Please honor us with your presence. I am so happy! - And I will honor them. - I'll get going then. Wait. Wait, uncle. I am sure your blood pressure is fluctuating after reading this letter. Go carefully, uncle. It is in English. Make sure someone who knows English reads it. People like you will even consider a warrant as a visa. Postman! This is what I too felt until now. - Okay. - That he lies. But for the first time I felt as if.. My son got the visa for Canada. "Time to dance and celebrate!" "Invite everyone!" "Time to dance and celebrate! Invite everyone!" I think someone's very romantic today! "It's time to celebrate!" He got the visa! I too will go with Jassi. I want to go to Canada. On a plane! Jassi got the visa! Villagers! There, Sehma has already started broadcasting it. Jassi got the visa! Now Jassi will go there for sure!
