We just got to find out if they're holding him there. Negative, sir. He's not here. Neg--he's not there? No. Okay, how long, um... Is there any--is-- you guys handle Pershing and Pulaski, correct? If he was arrested there? It depends on what side of the street. What side of the street. Tenth district, you might as well check them. With what, ninth? Tenth district. Tenth district? No, sorry, that's the 8th district, sir. You got the first district. No, I don't have anybody by that name. We spend the rest of the day trying to find any info on where Kaspar was being held or what he was arrested for. After a while, we figured he may have given the cops a different name, so the best thing to do was to sit and wait, sit and wait for Kaspar to contact us, only that never happened. ♪ On Friday, April 11th, about 5:00, we got a call. Two beat cops on routine patrol noticed a suspicious-looking car with its doors left open in a lot. Upon further investigation, the officers found what appeared to be blood on the interior of the car, upon which our department was notified. ♪ Hi. Ma'am? Hi, can I help you? Hi, yeah. How are you? You know the gentleman that lives in the back? I'm an old friend of his. I've been back there a couple times looking for him, and... Okay. Yeah, I haven't seen him for about a week. Really? Yeah. All right, um, kind of a strange question, but have the cops been by here or anything? All right, no big deal. Should--should-- No, don't be worried. I'm just an old friend of his. I've just been looking for him. I haven't seen him in, like, a week. Can I pass a message on to him for you? Yeah, just tell him Rob was by looking for him. I'll stop back by in a couple days or something. Okay. All right. I don't get it, man. If that was Kaspar's car that the cops found at the warehouse, then why haven't they been by here? Later we realized the cops really didn't know anything, not even Kaspar's real identity. We were dying to know more, what happened, and did the cops even know he was a burglar? Well, our main concern is not to lose our footage, and we don't want to lose anything that we've already got, but we want to try and cooperate as well. You--you may lose custody of some of the footage, some or all the footage and your notes. There's a privilege in Illinois that's a source privilege, and usually it's applied in someone that's not wanting to divulge their information. That--that privilege is under 735 ILCS 58901. It says, "No court may compel any person to disclose the source of any information obtained by a reporter." How would you describe this case? What's the name of the perpetrator? Kaspar Carr. Kaspar Carr. Yes. This is Moran. Detective Moran, my name is Baron Harmon, and I represent some documentarians who have some information relating to some burglaries that were committed in Chicago, and... Okay, hold on a second, sir. What is your name, Harmon? Wait, I also need to tell you that I'm tape-recording this call. Okay, we're tape-recording this phone call because why? Because this is part of the documentary. That they want to come to you now with the-- with the evidence that they've accumulated. Uh, what--what-- is this in regards to a vehicle that was found in a lot on Pershing? That's the one, Kaspar Carr. Kaspar Carr is--is he-- okay. So we'd like to just set up an appointment with you. Who--who is Kaspar Carr? Well, that--that's the person that we believe is-- his true name-- the individual that was-- The owner of the car? The owner of the car, or that's what they believe. When can these guys come in? I'm at area three. Do--are they familiar with that? You're at area-- Three is on Belmont and Western. Do you know where that is? It's Belmont and Western, right by Lane Tech, isn't it? Our attorney arranged for us to turn over our footage. The sooner detectives could solve the case, the sooner we'd find out what happened to Kaspar. ♪ Hey, detective. Detective. Hey, I've been trying to get ahold of you for a week, man. I just keep getting the runaround. I just called the precinct; they said you weren't in. I just want to talk about the case. So do you mind starting from after Kaspar's car was found? Blood was found in the driver's seat area on the floor and on the inside driver's side door and window. This led us to believe that the victim received injuries to the head or upper-body area, and it was concluded that the victim could not have lost that amount of blood and survived. Over the next few weeks, investigators solved close to 100 open burglary cases, all said to have been the sole work of Kaspar Carr. As for what had happened to Kaspar, it seemed that detectives had a theory, but they certainly weren't sharing it with us. Yeah, Robert, this is Detective Moran. I need to speak with you. Give me a call at 312-744... There was one score that completely didn't fit Kaspar's profile, and investigators wanted to talk to us about it. They want to know how much money we thought he took. They want to know how he found out about it. After reviewing the footage we'd turned in, detectives were surprised to find that one of the burglaries we filmed was never reported. Which one? Slick's. What are you ing doing? Why did Kaspar's plans change that night, and why did he put everything on hold for two months after that score? Detectives thought they had the answer. On May 10, 2003, police brought in Goran Uschev, owner of Slick's Tavern, for questioning in regards to the disappearance of Kaspar Carr. Detectives believe that Mr. Uschev, who has a criminal history, had both the motive and the ability to murder Kaspar Carr. After 36 hours of questioning, police charged Mr. Uschev with an unrelated misdemeanor charge. For lake of evidence, state's attorneys refused to prosecute Uschev for anything related to the murder of Kaspar. Hi, how are you? Is Goran Uschev in? I'm sorry, he's not here tonight. Okay, uh, well, when's he usually in? He's usually here in the day. You'll have to come back tomorrow. Okay, what--what time should I come back? Anytime. Hi, how are you, man? What's up, man? Hi, Rob Rogers. I'm a documentary filmmaker. And can I speak with the manager? I wanted to ask him about a, uh... Okay, great. Can he come out? Yeah, come on. Yeah, Rob Rogers. Nice to meet you. How are you doing? Documentary filmmaker. I'm here to talk to you about the break-in that happened about six months ago? I'm not the owner. There's no owner here, man. I got to ask you to leave, bro. Thank you. I just need to talk to the owner. - There's no owner here. - Get the out of here. We already spoke to the cops about the break-in. We're just trying to get your response on what happened that night. Detectives have yet to find any incriminating evidence against Mr. Uschev, and with no new leads, the investigation into Kaspar's disappearance has been put on hold. ♪ What's up, motherers? Come on, we got to go. I'll get in trouble. So how you doing? Doing all right. How long you been here at work release? Two weeks. Where you working at? Working over there at Lorraine's, the greasy spoon over here. I'm straight and narrow. So what do you think happened to Kaspar? Who? Kaspar Carr, the guy you led us to. I don't know what you're talking about, man. All right. Well, did you hear the story about the burglar who's car was found full of blood? You know that guy? Yeah, I knew Kaspar. Why don't you want to talk about him? 'Cause there's nothing to talk about. The Illinois State Police Crime Lab would not comment directly on Kaspar's case; however, we did manage to obtain an interview with retired forensic pathologist Jim Sherlock, who has investigated Chicago crime scenes for over 25 years. Could it be determined by the amount of blood left at a crime scene if the victim did not survive? I don't believe so. I don't--I don't believe that you could make that determination just based on the volume of blood left at the crime scene. I've been at crime scenes where there's been a teaspoon of blood and the person did not survive. I've been at other crime scenes where there's a large-- large pools of blood, and just by looking at it, you'd say there's no way this individual could survive, and you find out later that they're alive and well. So I don't believe it's possible to tell if a person's dead just by the amount of blood loss at a crime scene. I'd have to see the body. Did investigators have it right? I mean, these are the same guys that for two weeks couldn't figure out Kaspar's identity or his home address. And that night after Slick's, what was really going through Kaspar's mind? He says one thing... You guys are just getting too close. And then comes back two months later and does the exact opposite... Letting us come in and film him taking down his biggest score. $104,100. It just doesn't add up. We have so many questions we'd like to ask, only Kaspar's not here to answer him. What would you do if you weren't a thief? What are you ing talking about? You go too far with your questions. You're not gonna get anywhere. I'm not-- I'm two steps ahead of you. I could have been a ing plumber. I could have been a doctor. I could have been an accountant. I could have been a ing male stripper. I'm a burglar, you know? If I had to tomorrow change my, uh, you know, outlook on life and do something else, I'm ing ready. Just stick to the ing profession. You're not going to get a sob story out of me.
