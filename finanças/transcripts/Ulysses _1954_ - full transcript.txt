I'll be here when I get back. When I return. Many times we saw shooting stars, through the walls of Tr ia he saw everything he loved, on the other side of the sea. He was talking about this house. and the room where he would wait for him. I waited for many years. First it was news of the war. The war lasted for months and months have become years. I spent the years wondering, '' Where is he now? Will you be with the soldiers? '' Maybe she has another woman, beautiful and full of life. Maybe I forgot. But Pen lope remains faithful. It was so easy to be faithful. But one day comes the news that the war is over. Everyone is happy. Kings and soldiers return home. But he is not among the others. The wait resumes. Months and years. From years to a thousand hours, days and nights. The nights, awake in the empty bed. Waiting. You're right. Sometimes it gets too late. Wait, do not go. I spoke bitterly, for tomorrow I will choose a husband, against my will. I must keep the promise ... No one can save me. You can save yourself. I? As? Remember the contest when you and Ulysses got married? Remember how the arrow went through 12 axes? Yes, I was the prize. The bow was heavy, impossible to bend. Only Ulysses could bend it. With the help of the goddess Athens. Thank you, stranger. You go to the kitchen, you will be welcome. Do you need anything else? Not after I saw you and talked to you. You're welcome in my house. Thank you, Pen lope. Argus. You recognized me. Quiet, Argus, quiet. Old man, we both changed. Remember how we mountain all day? You were always the first in the pack. It was fast and fierce. Now it is weak until raise the head. But you recognized me. Yes ... I was well received. He recognized him. Who are you? Tel maco. -My son. -Dad. Father ... Father! Quiet! No one can know that I'm here. I look forward to telling everyone! "I'll make you tremble with fear." "Do not tell anyone." We will not be ready yet. Why these clothes? Why come as a beggar? When I arrived the gods they advised me. They also gave other advice. Mom, she's desperate. -We will say that you came back. -No! Not even she should know. I will not see you tomorrow. I'll know if she still loves Ulysses. How he loved when he left. What you want? How did you get in? Like any beggar, by the port of service. Go or I'll let the dogs go. V ! "Let me speak to the nobles." -No. Tel maco is my friend and will not oppose you. Tel maco do not send me any more, get out! Let him stay. Let it... You! Come here. Come here. Alms for an unfortunate. Noble friend Alms for an unfortunate. Why do not you ask Tel maco? He will not be among us for a long time. Beggars were always welcome in the house of Ulysses. Dirty ... and insolent. He speaks as if he were already master of the house. -We are both guests. - Come on, you filthy bastard! Alms for an unfortunate. On here! Are you thirsty? Drink it! Drink more. Thank you, gentlemen, gods reward them. Here, take, all I can do. You're kinder than the others. Escape as soon as you can or it will be too late. What are you saying? Are you crazy? Skirt! Until the games are over, I I order who leaves this house. He's right, Antinomus. You think too much. Nice to see you. What are the axes for? the queen's desire. She'll explain. " -Where's the queen? "Have patience, Antinomus. You're getting ready as a bride. The heart is full of love, there is no room for patience. -Good, Antinomus ... -You expressed yourself for us all. The Queen. May the gods protect us. His beauty enlightens us, like a divine sun, Pen lope. The day has come to keep my obligation I will marry the winner of the games. We look forward very much and eagerly. I chose a game that been long forgotten. The bow of Ulysses. I will marry the man who bends him and Throw the arrow through the axes. That's not the games of Apollo. If you are afraid you can leave the contest. I'm not afraid, Pen lope. I accept the challenge. I was the first to come here, For many years, ask Pen lope's hand. I'll be the first to bend the bow. You must be the first to leave .... I can not ... I can fold! Let me try. I can not bend at all. You're too fat, Leodes. This bow was cursed. ... let me try, There is something strange. Apollo is offended and takes away the force. As Apollo can take what Never had? Give me the bow. - Come on, Antinomus. -You can. Let's go. "Let him try, he can." -Get it on, let's go ... This time he can do it. Fold! "It does not bend, the strength is superhuman." - It's a trick! -That's a trick. "Pennylope's rug." -Yes. -The carpet. I do not accept it. I demand your promise, Pen lope. Does the queen allow me to pick up the bow? A beggar competing with princes? I can compete. And you? It's incredible that the beggar wants compare your strength to ours. Pen lope, I would like to get married. with the beggar? Do not be afraid, you would not marry, I'm already married.

Tel maco. No, Ulysses. Too late. I told you I do not give a gift. life twice. Athens, thank you. Powerful Goddess. Protector of the house. You too protected Ulysses while I waited. Thanks for your answer. Horrible things happened to me. But nothing worse than bringing death home with my arrival. It's not your fault, Dad. Tell the servants to purify the room with fire. "May the revenge of the dead not strike us." -Yes father. Athens, the revenge was fair but terrible. The Ulysses he brought comes back to an angry man. Forced to kill without mercy. divine Athens. Your long back trail Does it have to be so full of blood? Pen lope! Ulysses. There was no other way to get back to you. He returned ... Finally! So many years of youth wasted by the war. I got lost wandering without imagining -It's solid. -I was alone. Pen lope ... I will repay you quiet years ahead. "Yes, together." -Penlope ... Ulysses ... The centuries did not diminish the glory, the heroic deeds of Ulysses. In the cave of Polyphemus still echo the cries of the son of Neptune ... The suffering face of Pen lope still looking out to sea ... And far away, Circe still did magic. Immortality rejected by Ulysses was given to him by a poet ...
