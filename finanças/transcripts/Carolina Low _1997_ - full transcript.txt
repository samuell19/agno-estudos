- 'Preciate your situation, Louis. I'm sure you understand ours. This is a... national crisis. I mean, that's what it is. -Seem's mighty close to home to me. - Well now, we've been lending you folks... ...right regular. I assume you know that, Louis. It just... ... it can't keep on. - We're not asking for a loan Mr. Gentry. It's the... payin' we're here about. - I know that, son. I'm telling you, it hurts me to call on these payments from friends and neighbors. I've been living in this town going on 20 years now. It's my home. It's the only way we can keep the bank open. We got obligations ourselves. - Maybe I can get a job at the tannery in Seville. I hear there's loggin' work up in Tennessee. - Whoa. - God lord, here comes trouble. - There's a dance over at Bryson tonight. - It ain't but about five. -Well, Oshel likes to be on time. -Yeah, if there ain't work involved he can be right punctual. -How you doin' Mr. Bancroft. - Oshel. -You fellas sure are fond of dirt. -It's called work. -Yeah, I heard of it. -Henry, -I don't wanna hear about you goin' up to Calvin's tonight. -No sir. - Well, it's five o'clock now, dance starts at eight... takes 'bout an hour to get there, so... Gives us two whole hours to get that pig smell off of you. If you weren't so dirty, I'd woop your ass. - Oshel Hooper, you oughta be ashamed of yourself. Your mama must be fit to be tied. -I'm too quick for her now. -Awww, Henry. You look just like Rudolph Valentino. -Yeah, or Pretty Boy Floyd. -Who's that, Mama? -Well let's get goin'. We don't wanna keep those women waitin'. -Miss Bancroft, it was nice visitin' . -Bye, Mama. Bye, Sissy. - Bye. - Why'd you have to say that about me lookin' like an outlaw? -I'm sorry. -Well, you know Mama's touchy about that. - Hey, did you hear they robbed a bank up near Bristol last week? -No. -Kyler Gang robs Tennessee Bank. -I didn't bring my glasses, you read it. -The Sullivan County Bank was robbed of $4000 Tuesday. One of the tellers, J.C. Cox recognized one of the men as Jake Kyler. Burt Kyler was not identified. I don't care a thing about that mess. -Well, they yer cousins ain't they? I should think you'd be a little bit interested. -Well, I'm not. -Oshel! Stop it!! Better stop! -Hey Henry! -Mama had me in the kitchen makin' peach preserves all afternoon. I know I smell just like a peach. -Well, I love peaches. -Come on. -Lookie here. Grade A chalk. -Did you get that from my Uncle Calvin? -Nope. Old Man Wyman. Your uncle costs too much. -So you gonna marry. that girl or what? -I don't have a thing in the world to offer her. 'Cept for myself and I don't know that's worth much. -You gotta point there. -You don't get rich farmin' 'round here. -Day late and a dollar short. - For what? -Go West... Dodge City.... adventure! -Your ol daddy had aventure over there in France, and he didn't come back. -I had a wonderful time, Henry. -Me too. -Well... -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Been thinkin' about Rachel, Daddy. -Yeah... -'Bout askin' her to marry me. -Uh-uh. -She'll be goin' off to college in the fall if I don't stop her. -Well, maybe you oughta let 'er go. -We all know about the Bradley family. They're leavin' for Detriot, Michigan this week. Well, they may have lost their farm... But we don't intend to see them off to Detroit City empty handed. So let's dig deep. Let's find that load. That wellspring... of Christian brotherhood. And make a love offerin' to the Bradley's this mornin'. I must have Jesus, All of my trials. I cannot bare these Burdens they hold In my distress He And He will help me. He ever loves and, cares for His own. I must have Jesus. I cannot bare these, burdens alone. I must have Jesus. -You've got the voice of an angel. -It was so hot up there, I thought I'd melt. -Rachel, it's time for us to go. -Yes, Daddy, I was just talkin' to Henry for a minute. -Judge Smathers. -Henry. -All Daddy's family is havin' dinner at Grandma's It's her birthday. Come see me Saturday. -You tell her I said "Happy Birthday"! -Hey, what you got to eat there? -Didn't you bring nothin'? -I brought food for the mind. -Whatchu readin' on now? -This here is about the James Gang. -Mike wrote it, too. So it's true. It's historical. -Murderers and theives an' you think they gonna tell you the truth in a book? -Yeah, I was just readin' 'bout George Washington the other day. You remember him, don't you? -Yeah, I reckon I know who George Washington is. -The moment the revolutionary war was over, They wanted to make that man a King of America. Just imagine that- the King of America. -Yeah, you'd like that. Sit on yer ass all day an' eat for free. -But instead he went right back home and he picked up a plow. PLOW! -But it's a good life, Oshel. It's an honest life. I like farmin'. I like it. -Whooo. -Henry. I forgot all about it. Henry, This is David Trick. He's comin' to teach at the school next year. David's gonna' teach American History and coach baseball n' basketball. Why don't we all go in and I'll fix some lemonade. -No, I just stopped by to say "hello". Could I talk to you for a minute. -Well, of course you can, Henry. -I'll just go wait up on the porch. -Henry, I'm so sorry. Maybe next Saturday, we can do somethin' real special. -Who is he? -He...I just told you. He's the new... -I know that. -Well, if you wanna know him better why don't you come back and visit with us. -I don't wanna visit with him. -Daddy asked me to entertain him. -Well, you all have a real nice afternoon. -Same to you. Hey, you need a ride anywhere? -I like to walk. But I thank you. -He had a little rag top. Looked brand new! -Hey, I saw that car this mornin'. It was parked at the school. Whooo! A fella could get him some in a car like that! Maybe he's her cousin. A relation. Somethin'. -Yeah, well... whoever he is he's got fancy clothes an' a fancy car, an' she's somewhere havin a time in it! -Buddy, you need a drink! -That was mighty fine, Miss Hooper. -Well, thank you, Henry. You come back for real supper next time. -We're goin' out for a little while, Mama. -Well don't wear that dirty ol' hat! - I'll wear it if I want to! -Well, you all be careful out there on the road! Everybody's out on a Saturday night! - Yes ma'am! - Whooee! Would ya' look at that! Reckon those folks will be spendin' this evenin' at the Balsam Mountain Inn. Probably get there just in time for a late supper. -How do you know? -Was up there once. Jumped a caboose outta Dilport. It's a fine lookin' hotel. It's all lit up in the twilight. There's music playin'- real pretty fiddle music. Whoo. Coupla snorts of this 'n we'll be hearin' music ourselves. -Henry, quit frettin' 'bout Rachel. You know she's crazy 'bout you. -Yeah, well. -Gotta' stop worryin' all the time, son. She thinks that you hung the moon... -Well, I didn't. -I know that. She don't. She thinks... -Shut up! -What's the matter with you? -I've got things on my mind. -What things? I told you, Rachel... -It ain't about Rachel! -Well, what is it? -It's the farm. We might lose it. -I thought your place was clear. -Well... Daddy had to take a loan to pay the taxes. And now we gotta repay the loan. An' they ain't gonna wait till the crops in They ain't gonna take it in corn. So, the bank takes the place, -Bank... we move to town. -Dang. -Yep. -Sons of bitches! -Henry Bancroft. What you need is hard cash. -That's what everybody needs. -People goin' up to Balsam, they got money. You got to have money to go places like that. -That ain't doin' me no good. -I don't see why not. -What are you talkin' 'bout, Oshel? -Robin Hood. -Come again? -Robin Hood. Robbing from the rich. And giving to the poor. We the poor, ain't we? -Oshel, you're crazy. -No, I'm not. -You've been readin' too many of them stupid books. -No, I haven't. -Weʻd get caught. -Not if we were to rob somethin' that nobody'd expect us to rob. -Like what? -The train, Henry. -We could rob the Great Smokey Mountain Railway! -I ain't robbin' a train, Oshel. -An' neither are you. -I could do it! I could see us doin' it! -What you see is Jesse James. -Yeah, and Butch Cassidy, and Black Bart I know how they did it! I read all about it! -Readin' about it, and doin' it is two different things! We could get killed. -Not if we do it right. We got the element of surprise. Ain't nobody gonna expect us to rob a damned train! We know these mountains. -You're drunk. -No I'm not. -Yes you are. -Look. You wanna keep the farm, don't you? You want Rachel Smathers to marry you, don't you? How you gonna do that? They're rich people, Henry. Rich people. I don't know how they got rich... Maybe they robbed people to get their money. That's what the bank's doin' all over this county. Foreclosin' on people. Auctionin' off everthing they got. It's robbery, Henry. The world is full of theives. Who's gonna notice us? -Why'd you saw it off? -'Cuz that's how train robbers do it. -Lot's a famous outlaws and gunfighters used them. Doc Holiday used one to kill Ike Clinton at the Okay Corral. -We ain't gonna kill nobody. -Of course we ain't. We gotta look like we would. They ain't just gonna hand the money over to us, you know? -I reckon not. -Hey, waddaya gonna wear? -I donno. -Well, don't wear that. -Well, what do you want me to wear? -I don't know.

We gotta show 'em who's boss. -Well, you don't have to cuss 'em to death! -Seriously, though. I think this is in there... I'm gonna do it for you, so you won't be scared when I do it. You ready? -Yeah. -Alright, folks. Let's just get them hands up and nobody gets hurt. We come here to rob you, not to kill you. But if you force our hands, we won't hesistate to shoot you like a dog!

He was tryin' to kill us. -Well, I reacon he wouldn'ta been tryin if we weren't -If we weren't robbin' the damned train! -Look, Henry. We're in this together. As far as anybody knows, we both killed that boy. That's what they're gonna think anyway. -But you didn't kill him, Oshel. -I did. Do you hear somethin'? No. Let's get across the river. Oshel, look! - Let's go! Let's go! Right through. -Come on! I got an idea. Come on! Alright. Breathe through this. - Alright? - Okay. -One. Two.... Three! -What's wrong with them dogs? -Looks like they lost the scent. -I guess they're probably down stream by now. Alright! We're goin' down stream! - What are we gonna do now? -Maybe we can go to Tennessee. -We can't walk to Tennessee. -We got this. -I don't see no wheels on it! -We can pawn it in Knoxville or Chattenooga. -How we gonna get there? -We ain't got no car. We ain't got no food. We can only freeze to death. -We gotta find your cousins. - No sir! - YES! - NO! - YES! - NO! - YES! -NO!!! We don't wanna get mixed up with them, we're in enough trouble. -I know we're in trouble. That's why we gotta find them! They'll know what to do! -You don't even know! -I know they ain't been caught. I know that much. -I don't even know where they are. They could be in Chicago for all I know. -No, they don't even go too far from home. They're around here somewhere. -Well I suppose we're just gonna run into a signpost somewhere That says: "This way to the Cuyler Gang" -I bet yer Aunt Josie knows where they are. -Aunt Josie, we got to find Jake and Burt. -Yer breakin' your mother's heart. -I know about that. -Do you know where they are? -You don't want help from them. -Aunt Josie, please just tell us where they are. -Better get you boys something to eat. -Let's just go, she don't know where they are. -She knows. - How do you? - She knows. -Are they up at Toe String? -Boys better be goin'. Whole town's a buzzin'. -Yes ma'am. Thank you. -Well, what do we do now? -I know where they are. -Where? Where are you goin'? -What about that way? -Damnit, Henry! -Hey, uh... -Why aren't there any pictures of him around your house? -Mama put them all away. She hardley even says his name anymore. Aunt Beth gave me this one. -Well, why's your mama like that? I mean, he was a war hero and everything. -Because he didnt' have to go to the war, that's why. He enlisted, right off the bat. Hell, I don't blame him. I'da done the same thing. -Do you remember him? -Yeah, I do. Mama says I couldn't because I was too young, but I do. He come home once when I was about three. Family had a party for him over at Aunt Beth's house. I remember he come in in his uniform. An' somebody said: "Oshel, here's yer daddy." Hell, I knew who he was. Remember he picked me up an' he said: "Hello there, Mister Oshel." That's what he called me too, the whole time. He'd say: "Me and Mister Oshel are gonna have us some cake." "Me an' Mister Oshel are gonna go sit out on the porch for a while." I don't think he put me down all evenin'. -And when he left that time, you remember that? -You know, I tried. -But I just... don't. - You sure you know where we're goin'? -Nope. -Damnit, Henry! -It's on the reservation. I know that much. Grandaddy had a house up there, but I ain't been to it in years. -You think you could find it again? -I reckon we'll see. -Damn! We're gonna get scalped! -I can't believe you can read now. -It keeps me from having to talk to you. -Well, what is it anyway? -Shakespeare -Hamlet, Prince of Demark. -Lord, you need a dictionary to read that. -No, you don't. -You just go on down here to the bottom, an' they tell you what the words mean. Look here. Blaison. You know what that means? "A revelation of eternity". -Why don't they just say that the first time? Instead of usin' words nobody ever heard of? -Because that's the way Englishmen talk. -How many Englishmen have you talked to? -Not any, but Shakespeare was an Englishman, So, I reckon that's how they talk. -Hamlet, Prince of Demark. We're probably in Demark right now, for all you know. -I'm pretty sure this ain't Denmark. -He's tore up because his daddy, King Hamlet's dead, an' his momma's gone and married his brother. -Who's brother? Hamlet's? -She married King Hamlet's brother. -Oh, I was fixin' to say, I hope she didn't marry Hamlet's brother. -What? -Well, I mean I hope she didn't marry her own boy! -That wouldn't be right. -Anyway, so a fellow sees his ghost walking around. - His what?! - If you shut up for a damned minute, I'll explain it to you. Hamlet's daddy was the king. And now he's dead. - Now he's a ghost. -Will you forget about that? Hamlet's daddy is dead. An his momma marries his uncle. A fella named Claudius. - An' Hamlet's all torn up about it? -Right. -I reckon so. -Get into that ghost part. -Well. It's the ghost of his daddy, see? An' he tells Hamlet that he's been murdered. -I should have known that if you was readin' it, there'd be some kinda killin' in it. -Well, at least I read. -I read! -What? -The Bible! -An' I reckon that's got no killins in that?! -Well, of course there's killin' in The Bible. -But it's to show us it's wrong. That's what it's there for. -The Bible don't have all like what you're read. -Henry... Do you recall that the main person in The Bible was nailed to a cross? -Now that, Is completely different! That wasn't no murder. -Well, I bet if we asked Jesus, he'd have another opinion. -Jesus Christ died for your salvation and mine too. Considerin' our situation, you ought not be blasphemin' about it. -I appreciate what Jesus did an' all, All I'm sayin' is you gotta admit there's killin's in The Bible. -Well, maybe. -But it's to teach us somethin'. -How 'bout Moses? -What about him? -He was an outlaw. -He led the people out of bondage! That's what he done. He wasn't that much different from Jesse James. -Oshel, you are crazy! -Jesse James an' all that trash you read about, they were cold-blooded killers. -Listen, if you was to take all the people, that Jesse James, an' Billy the Kid, an' John Dillinger killed, and you's ta' add 'em all up, they wouldn't compare to nothin' to when 'ol Moses waived his arms and had the waters come down on all of them Egyptians. -God told him to do that! -So what? God don't like Egyptians? -I guess he don't. -Oshel, you're crazy. You and yer big ideas. -Just shut up, we got away didn't we? -But that don't make it right, Oshel. -An' who the hell is to decide what's right and what's wrong, Henry? Who told you that? Where'd you get it from? Your momma? All that mess you hear in church? Ain't none of it like they say it is, is it? It ain't right you losin' your farm. It ain't right, my daddy gettin' killed off in the war somewhere. There's nothin' right about any of that. - Henry... Henry... Time to get up. - What? You wanna biskit? - Alright, so... Laertes says: "How 'bout you" 'An he cuts Hamlet on the arm. - With the poison sword? That little bastard! - 'An Hamlet goes after him, alright? But Laertes blocks it! - Alright. - Alright. - But Laertes blocks it... and then Hamlet goes after Laertes. I mean, Laertes goes after Hamlet. - Alright. - So he takes a swing, but Hamlet's too quick for him. - Alright, alright. - He blocks it! Then Hamlet gives him quick as he can, a left hook upside the head. - Alright. - Good. Alright. An' then they drop their swords and they start dukin' it out. - Ow! - You didn't like that, huh? - Well what you gonna do now?! - Hamlet's whoopin' his ass pretty damned good. You stink! Let go of me! - Okay! Then Laertes picks up a sword. - Alright. - But it's the wrong one, see? Hamlet's got the poison sword. - Alright. - An then they go at it some more. Then Hamlet gets his payback and he cuts Laertes on the arm. 'Course he don't know it's the poison sword. - Wait a minute... ... does Hamlet die? - You never let me finish, I'll get to that! - Does Hamlet die?! Yes, or no?! Goddamnit! Does Hamlet die?! - It's just a story, Henry! - Well, I wish you'd never told it to me. - That's why they call it a tragedy, you know? - Aseo chuch! Now, get them goddamned hands up! - You move over there, or I'll blow your head off. Move goddamnit! - Look mister we don't... - Shut up! Get down on your knees. - Mister, we was just... - Get down on your goddamned knees!! Poke them legs out here. Poke yer goddamned legs out! Take them shoes off. Take off the shoes. Toss 'em over here. - Esche! - Oust! - Go on. Keep going. Get your ass on up there. Go on. Now stop right there! Now get down on your knees. Now, you just keep your mouth shut. - That's him. - Oh, thank God. - What you got there, Brownie? - A couple 'a trespassers. - Huh. - They said they were looking for you. - Brownie, I don't know these boys. - You want I should shoot 'em? - Oh shit! - Whatever you think. - Jake!! It's me! It's Henry Bancroft! I'm Lucy's boy! - Cousin Henry? That you? - Yeah, yeah. - Well, I'll swear it! Who you got with you there? - Oshel Hooper, sir. - Hooper? You Sam Hooper's boy? - Yessir, I sure am. - Well, well, well. What brings you boys up to Toestring? - Well, sir we're in a little bit of trouble. - We're in a LOT of trouble. - Is that right? What kind of trouble? - We robbed the Great Smokey Mountain Railway. - Now wait a minute. Now, which one of you is Jesse an' which one is Frank? Damn boys! Trains move! Now you 'oughta start out robbin' somethin' that sets still. - We stopped it. - In a tunnel. Oh, that's good- stoppin' it in a tunnel. I mean, robbin' a train's a lot easier when it's dark. - Damn. boys. What were you thinkin'? - The way we had it figured... - We werenʻt thinkin' much. - Well, I gotta hand it to you. Now, you may be stupid, but you got brass balls. How much you get away with? - We had about- - We lost most of it in the river. - Well, that beats all. Reckon you want somethin' to eat. - Weʻd appreciate it. - Yessir. - Well, come on in the house, Cousin Henry. You too, Hooper. Brownie, you can come in for a while. - What are you doin'? Yer' makin' us look like idiots. - We ARE idiots. - We got some viscious train robbers. Come on in the house, boys. Let me introduce... Clarise! We got company. Boys, this here's Clarise. An' this here's Rodney. This is George back here. An' Red behind him. An' I think you already met Brownie once. Come on back here. Let me show you to Burt. Hey Burt! Hey Burt! Lookie here! Cousin Henry! And this here's.... uh... Oshel Hooper! Yer daddy won a metal in the war didn' he? - Yessir, he sure did. - I remember that. - How you doin', Burt? - Heʻs feelin' poorly these days. You remember Henry, don't you? Lucy's boy. - I remember you. - Well, now this calls for a celebration! Red, get one of them jugs out! Let's have us a litte party! Phew! OSHEL- He says to him... "I got to get back to Atlanta. What is the holdup?" An' I said... ... Well, mister. Yer lookin' at it. - You wanna arm wrestle? - No, not right now. Thank you. - Henry, what's the matter with you? Shhhh! Shut up! I think I hear somethin'! They're out there! Everybody get to a window! - Henry, did you hear somethin'? - They'll never take me alive, boys! - Whoa! Whoa! I think we got em'! - Henry, ain't nobody comin' out here lookin' for you. We got ourselves an arrangement with the sheriff- we don't bother him, he don't bother us. - Damn. You boys are wild! - No George, I do not wanna arm wrestle! - Burt Cuyler! Get up outta that chair an' get a drink. Come on, now! Get up. Get in here an' have a drink! Well, shit. Burt won't do nothin'! Let's go outside for a while. - Hows the family, Henry? - They're fine, Burt. Just fine. - Do you all still live out there by Paradise Falls, in that nice place? - Yessir, we sure do. - You ever see a snake come outta it's skin? 'Can, you know? Just slip right on out. I seen one when I was a boy. I was choppin' wood at the wood pile- an I seen him. A big ol' black snake, just rubbin' his-self against the logs. He just kept rubbin'... An' rubbin' til he... Left that ol' skin behind an' crawled away from it. I'm wonderin' how he knew to do that. Somethin' musta said to him: "Snake, you can do better than this." Jus' rub yourself up against that there log. An' get yerself some new clothes." I wish people could do that. Just change that way. Hell, I wish I could. Just slip right on out of this skin. Come out lookin' all shiny an' new. That sure would be fine. 'Course other than that, I don't believe I'd care to be a snake. - NO BURT! Burt! Burt! Not tonight. Not tonight. Not tonight. Not tonight. Plays that damned song day and night! - Well, I reckon you're the only one who didn't get drunk. - No, I jus'... Smelled breakfast. Um... I wanna thank you for... washin' our clothes. - You gotta girl back home don't you? Polite lil' fella like you. - Yeah, I do.... Well... Did. I don't know. Better watch... watch that one. - You come from a big family, Henry? - Naw, jus' me an' my baby sister. an' mom n' daddy, course. - Me, I'm the oldest of seven. - Where you from? - Weaverville, you ever been there? - No. - Well. You could'a been there an' not even known it, now. It's that little. - You a long way from Weaverville, ain't you? - Yeah. I hated it there. I left home when I was nineteen. My family wanted me to marry Claude Buchanan. I almost did, too. His daddy owned the funeral home, so He made a good livinʻ. - There's no shortage of customers. - Hmmm. - He was a nice man. Not too bad lookin' neither. I reckon he's what you might call ʻquite a catch'. But, handled dead folks for a livin'. Now Momma said, "Now somebody's got to do it." I said, "But not my husband." - Why'd you get up with Jake? - I went to Asheville, got a job in a cafe. Well, one day, Jake comes in. An' he's handsome. Full of himself.... Jokin' an' all. - Mmmhmmm. - Henry... Don't trust them. Now Burt, he's crazy from the syphilis. And Jake... he jus'... - Well, good mornin', Cousin Henry. - Mornin'. - Good mornin', Reverend. Hey, you boys get yerself a little breakfast an' uh.... Let's have a little talk. - Rob a bank?! - Yeah, the bank in Robbinsville. It'll be easy. - Just hear him out, Henry. - I mean, put it this way- I'd rob it myself, but they got my face plastered all over creation. Besides, I promised him I wouldn't rob no places close to home. Mean a... cat don't shit in his own bed does he? - I donno, I.... - Let's do it. - Look, you just take one of the cars, you park it right in front... You walk right in. You don't even need a mask or nothin'. An' they're not gonna be 'spectin' two snot nose youngins to rob a bank. - Uhuh. - Let's do it. - Lets do it, Henry. - Itʻll be like takin' candy from a baby. Jus' bring the money back up here, we'll divide it up... You can lay low for a couple a' days, have a little fun... Then we'll take you up to Cinncinnatti. An' I know someone there who can get you up to Canada. - Let's do it, Henry. - We've got to have money. Whatta we gonna do, get a job? - Hell, I wish I was young, an' just gettin' started. - Well, cousin Henry. Let's get you fixed up. Here you go, Hooper. Sling some lead. - Jake, look. Brownie's got my shoes. I'd really like to have 'em back. - Well, just tell him you want them back. - Let's see here, Henry. You look like a .45 man. - If he's so crazy, why he got all these guns in here? - Makes him feel safe. - Don' it, Burt? You like packin these irons, don't you? Besides he ain't always crazy. Comes an' goes. 'Course it ain't loaded, now. A man would be a fool to give a crazy man a loaded gun. We make it easier on yer brother. - See you later, Burt! - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Uh... What are you aimin' at, son? Is it somethin in particular, or just the shed in general? - Henry here, he's got an eye. - Hell, I coulda' hit it too, if I took five minutes. - No you couldn't. - Hey! You wanna arm wrestle? - Hell yeah, George. Let's arm wrestle. You ready? 1, 2, 3, go... - You didn't even try! - I did my best. Youʻre the strongest man, and you now know it. - He didn't even try! - Alright! Ready, set, go! - One, two, three, GO! - Come on Red! Come on Red! - Come on Red! - George! - Whoa!! - Brownie!!

We was all hopin' that you'd be a boy. An' now look at you. Yer' a man. - You know where the money is? - There's 3700 dollars. - Paper said 5000. - Paper don't always say the truth. You take that. - Why Henry? - You need to go home. - Sissy! - Henry!! - Sissy, I want you to do somethin' for me, okay? - Okay. - I wan' you to give this to Daddy. - What is it, Henry? - Just give it to him, okay? - I'll be right back. If you have friends In Gloryland Who've left because of pain Thank God, up there they'll die no more They'll suffer not again. Then weep not friends, I'm goin' home Up there we'll die no more No cofins will Be made up there No graves on that bright shore The lame will walk in Gloryland The blind up there will see The deaf in Gloryland will hear The dumb will talk to me The doctor will not have to call The undertaker - no There'll be no pain up there to bear Just walk the streets of gold We'll need no sun in Gloryland The moon and stars won't shine For Christ himself is light up there He reigns of love divine Then weep not friends, I'm going home Up there we'll die no more No coffins will be made up there No graves on that bright shore I lost my Daddy, in the war. I lost my home to America I lost my heart to the girl next door I lost my youth where I found my sword My whole life here in this sack Ain't got no clothes but these on my back Ain't got no friends Ain't got no map Can't go on Can't ever go back If you can't go home Where do you go? Where do you go? If you can't go home Where do you go? Carolina home Carolina home See the mountains all around They're in my blood They're my kin, now Carolina took me down I'd change my ways But I don't know how My poor ma stares at the road But she ain't got no place to go She hears the train whistle blow She goes in and she close the door If you can't go home Where do you go Where do you go If you can't go home Where do you go Carolina home Carolina home
