GRANT: Heavenly Father... I have never asked for much. This world... this life... I won't lie. There have been hardships. A harder life than I ever thought any man was able to endure. I have endured. Lord, you know I have endured. But this? This is supposed to be a new beginning! Please. Lord, please... don't let this happen. That woman in there, she needs you! And that child, inside of her... needs you. Please. Francisco. Francisco, what's wrong? You see that old wagon? We've passed that before. Are we lost? No. Everything okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, Mr. Winchester, what are you doing? Why are we goin' in circles? What? Circles, we're not. We are. Hand me that horse whip. No. Will you just let me explain? The horse whip. Now. Get on your knees. Turn around. I won't ask you twice, get on your knees. COLE: Let just, let's just calm down. Mr. Henry who you waitin' for out here? FRANSICO: We've been travelin' in smaller and smaller circles for the last two hours now. Ooh, you're spiralin', aren't you? We're gettin' close to somethin'. Who you meetin' out here and where are they? COLE: I don't know what you're talking about. FRANCISCO: Yeah you do. FRANCISCO: Tell me where they are! Please. Don't look at me, don't look at me! Turn around. Tell me where they are. Tell me where they are. Did you forget how to speak? Obviously we shoot him first. Obviously. My God, what's happening? Shit. God dammit, Emery. Oh my God, what's happening? SCARLET: Oh my God! Oh my God. Oh my God, it's him. MARY: Shh. JACQUELINE: You okay, Cole? COLE: Jacqueline. Emery. It's good to see you. He was gonna kill me. You don't look so good, boy. -COLE: Emery, wait! Scarlet! Mary! Help. Hey, can you help me? COLE: Can you help me? No. EMERY: You can't keep me in here! I'm gonna get outta here! Come on! Let me out! Son of a bitch! I'm gonna get outta here! And when I do I'm gonna come get you! You. You're supposed to be dead! Boo! What are you doin' here? I could ask you the same question. But a better question would be... what are you doin' in here all alone? I don't see anyone here guardin' you, or dare I say, protectin' you. I mean where's the sheriff at? There is a jail. Shouldn't there also be a sheriff? I mean they left you in here like a sittin' duck. Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Ah, good, so she's near. What? Jacqueline, that's your daughter, right? The one you believe to be in earshot? Listen, you said it yourself, this is a jail. There's gotta be someone, there's gotta be a sheriff nearby. And if they get in... how do they get past me? Then, if they get past me and I tell 'em who you were? Any sheriff out here would let me kill you. I'd be doin' 'em a favor. Your wife. We brought her to this town. We saved her. FRANCISCO: I think it's about time we get you out of this cell. What do you think? Ask and you shall receive. But before we dance... I got to tell you a little story. Go on, have a seat there. You ain't goin' anywhere. Back home, you know what they used to call me? They used to call me Blackheart. Over the years... instead of just callin' me Blackheart, they started callin' me somethin' else. They started callin' me the Devil. Do I have your attention? You see, back home... I had a room. It was a room much like this one, in fact. Let me tell you it was a room that you did not ever leave again if you were to enter it. I once kept a man in there for several days. Kept feedin' him, supplyin' him with medical attention, just keepin' him alive. This was over a gamblin' debt... not a man who killed me, robbed me... stole my wife and sister. Your sister? Yes, Mary is also gone. What did you do with him? That colored girl is your sister? I left her with you! Don't you lie to me, boy. Please, stop. I beg you. Please, show me mercy. The way that you showed me mercy? Think about your wife. What do you think I'm doin' here, Emery? Did you think I wasn't gonna ask you where she was? That's why I'm gonna kill you. Stop. You kill me, you'll never find her. I want you to know that you're gonna die. You're gonna die, it's just a matter of time. As much as you like to think, someone will hear your cries for mercy, no one will. It's just you and me for hours and hours and hours, and we're gonna get to know each other real, real well. You're gonna tell me where my wife is, you're gonna tell me where my sister is, and you're gonna tell me where my money is. And before you go die, Emery, you're gonna tell me where your family is. That way you can die knowin' that I killed them too. I been tortured before. You think that scares me? I know men like you. Hell, I am men like you. You, you should be thinkin' about that darlin' little baby of yours. -Huh? Your wife went into labor when we shot you! Think about it, you got a boy... or a girl. Maybe a-- a son... maybe a daughter. Where's your daughter, Emery? How do you know she's my daughter? Well, after you shot me I could hear you. Hear you talkin'. You find my Jackie? She'll kill you. Is she here? Yes. And my money? I presume it's with her? At the brothel. Across the street! Your daughter's at the brothel. Please. Stop. Ask and you shall receive. -JACQUELINE: Hey! -FRANCISCO: Jacqueline! I don't know what you're talking about. FRANCISCO: Tell me where they are. Please. Don't look at me, don't look at me. Turn around. Obviously we shoot him first. Obviously. Oh my God! Oh my God, what's happening? -Shit. -God dammit, Emery! Oh my God, what's happening? SCARLET: Oh my God! SCARLET: Oh my God, Oh my God, it's him. MARY: Shh. JACQUELINE: You okay, Cole? COLE: Jacqueline. Emery. It's good to see you. He was gonna kill me. You don't look so good, boy. -COLE: Emery, wait! The hell, Emery! Cole was with us! He would've bled out anyway in the next hour. EMREY: I mean he would've slowed us down and died anyway! I'm going to get Francisco's gun. That right there, that is a mercy killin'. -Ah, ah, ah! -Where's the gold? -What? The gold, we know you're ridin' with it from New Orleans! Just tell us where it is and we can all be on our way. You don't know what you've done. Come on down. EMERY: Come out of the stagecoach now. Both of you! Let's go! EMERY: All right. Come on now, where is it? Let's go, quick now. In the trunk. The key. Come on, we haven't got all day. EMERY: I'll be damned. -My water just broke! I can take you into town. -EMERY: Dig. -Why? EMERY: Why you think? Are you gonna kill me? Don't you think you've killed enough people for one day? EMERY: Hmm. Dig! God dammit, this is takin' too long! EMERY: What are you diggin' through, granite? Do you wanna help me dig? EMERY: What? I said... you wanna help me dig? EMERY: Huh? Go on, pick up that shovel before she gives birth amongst the rattlesnakes! JACQUELINE: We best be goin', Emery. Put your hands behind your back. -What are you doin'? -SCARLET: No! -This is the only way. -MARY: No. Please. You can't just leave me out here! It's better than dyin'. But you leave me out here and I'm as good as dead! EMERY: Well, that's what we're gonna do, so you best comes to grip with that. SCARLET: I'm sorry. MARY: Scarlet! -MARY: Scarlet! -I'm sorry! SCARLET: I'm so sorry! No, please don't leave, no! How come I got all the drinks? Get this shit in front of ya! -WOMAN: All right! -Let's do it! I got two hands, right. Woo! Okay, here's how we play this game, right. If you can stand up then I take a drink. If I can stand up, I take a drink. CHRISTOPHER: What if I can stand up-- I don't give a shit about you. I don't even know what the hell he's talkin' about. WOMAN: Oh my goodness! CHRISTOPHER: Show us another trick, show us another trick! WOMAN: Queen of hearts! Ready, ready, uh, keep diggin'. JACQUELINE: All right. All right. This is my stop. What do you mean? This is where I'm meetin' my dad. SCARLET: That was your father? Look, uh, there's a mission about two miles up that way. If you hurry you should be able to make it there before you give birth. The Sisters of Mercy will be able to help you. SCARLET: You're just gonna let me go? Like I said, this is my stop. Already drunk? This is my Jackie. -Jackie! -CHRISTOPHER: How you doin' -MAN 1: Hi, Jackie. -MAN 2: Hi, Jackie. Move. What are you doin'? I'm makin' friends, that's what I'm doin'. This is Jackie, hey everybody. CHRISTOPHER: Hey, Jackie. You guys are gonna be our tour guide, for this fine town. Here's to Crow's Landing! JACQUELINE: I brought her here. I brought her here and I let her go. -What? I brought her here and I let her go. -EMERY: Stop. -What, stop your peacock'in! Stop talkin' about it! I am. MAN: That's more like it. That's my girl. That's right. That's more like it. That's my girl. Drinkin' in a brothel. Well, that ain't very ladylike. EMERY: Who said anything about her being ladylike? Well, Mr. Chaplin, what she'll have? She can order her own goddamn drink. Yeah, actually on second thought... I'm not thirsty after all. Oh? Well, what is it I can do for you? Well, this is a brothel, ain't it? It is. I think I'd like to order somethin' off that menu. Well, we have a fine selection of beautiful women. Finest in all the West. You work here, don't you? I do. Well? Well, what? Well, where are the bedrooms? Jackie. Don't. They're upstairs. Well, lead the way then, sir. Chester! Watch the bar for me! CHRISTOPHER: Chester! Watch the bar for me! Believe me... I can't miss at this range. I'm sure it would be messy though, huh brother? Oh, I've cleaned up plenty of messes in here, old timer. It ain't nothin' new. This is a brothel. Put the gun down. EMERY: I ain't doin' anything till I get my daughter. I ain't gonna let that son of a bitch embarrass my little girl like that either. She sounds willing. Okay. Okay, you win. Don't. Don't. I'll kill you. Calm down. No. No, I will not calm down! -Next round's on the house. That was... incredible. I guess you get a lot of practice, runnin' a brothel, huh? Yeah. Sure do! Stay the night? Stay the night? What are you, a girl? Nah, just the night. Then you can be on your way in the mornin'? You're just gonna kick me out so soon, huh? Nah, it ain't like that. I was thinkin' we could do it once or twice more before you leave is all. Is that supposed to be flattering? Well. Coming from a brothel owner who's had a lot of practice, like you said, yeah, yeah it is. Right. This really had nothing to do with you, okay? I was just tryin' to piss off Emery. -Who's Emery? -Does it matter? Guess not. Exactly. 'Cause it had nothin' to do with you. Kinda like to think it did. -It didn't. -It did. Alright, I guess we could do it once more before I go. See, I knew you'd come around. You're an odd duck, aren't you? An odd duck? Yeah. It's okay. I kinda like it. 'Course you do. -Everybody likes me. -That's not what I said. That's what I heard. Look, you seem... -nice. Nice people get hurt around me. Well, you're in luck. I ain't all that nice. -No? -No. As a matter of fact, I just used you for sex. -You used me? -Yep. -That was my intention, as soon as you came in the bar. I tricked you into takin' me upstairs. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah, you think a beautiful girl like you walks into my place and takes me by the hand? You got another thing comin', that's what you think. Okay. Okay, what? Say I spend the night? Yeah? It'd have to be free of charge, of course. Hmm. I'd have to ask the manager. All right, I can wait. Okay, so come on, who's Emery? Is that your husband downstairs, waiting to kill me after all this? Husband, no. Gross, no. It's my father. Oh, even worse. So your father just listened to us havin' sex. It's fine. Really. No, he'll probably be up in a little bit to kill you. Well, shit. Unless you kill him first, of course. You ever kill anybody? You? Yep. All the time. I'm sorry to hear that. Killin' ain't easy. It's not supposed to be. Who'd you kill? Well, we used to have this sheriff in town... one of our regulars used to come in and rough up the girls a little bit... one night it got a little too rough. I had to string him up. You hanged him. Plus side, though, I got my own jail now. That could come in handy, I guess. Yeah. Look, I'm gonna go downstairs and uh, check on the bar. JACQUELINE: Why? I left my brother in charge. Okay. Ah, Chester, what'd you do now? Damn bastard's heavier than I thought! We wouldn't be doin' this if you were doin' your job. CHRISTOPHER: You know I can't resist a fine woman. Sure, we'll just leave him here? Hell yeah. Best place for him. CHRISTOPHER: Let's go. -What can I get you, sir? -Nothing, nothing. Oh, come on, Willy, for three fuckin' minutes and you're already ransackin' the place? I swear to God I'm not in the mood. Get it, go, fine, sorry captain. MAN: We're leavin'. I'm sorry, sorry. Woo-ee! Animals. Chester look at this. -CHESTER: What is it? -CHRISTOPHER: Come here, look! That's a lot of gold. I do believe that's why we moved to the West. Well, brother, I do believe you are right. Francisco... are you alive? Please. Please help me. Can I help you? May I have a glass of water, please? Do you have any money? I'd prefer a glass of water. This will help take the edge off. Drink up. I don't think I want another. That edge ain't off yet. Ah. See? You're feelin' better already. Will you get her a glass of water? Did I tell you to get me a glass of water? Can I ask you somethin'? -You're not a runaway are you? -No. You look like a runaway. That war is over. Still shooting at each other in Louisiana. We're not in Louisiana. Look, it's no big deal. See, everybody in here's runnin' away from somethin'. Now, why don't you tell me where you got all that money. What money? All the money that you're spendin' on this fine, Kentucky Bourbon. But I already told you I don't have any money. You do realize I just cheersed you, right? Now, it's bad luck where I come from when someone doesn't drink up after someone cheerses 'em. I don't know what you're talkin' about. I just clinked your glass with mine, means you drink up. Why? I don't know why, it's what people do. You drink. Doesn't look like you can afford any more bad luck. So, back to payment. You see, the first two were on the house, but the third... well, nothing's free. Not in this lifetime anyway. I can work. Can you now? Here? Yes. Do you know what kind of place this is? -MARY: Yes. -CHESTER: What is it, then? It's a brothel. And do you know what a workin' girl does in a brothel? I have nowhere else to go. -Well, there's always somewhere. -No, there isn't. We've been riding for weeks on end, I've seen what's out there. There's nothin'. Are you sure you're not a runaway? -I already told you. -I know a lot of people that'll pay a lot of money for a runaway. Why don't you go ahead and tell me what happened? Nothin'. You're not suicidal are you? Is this your place, or is there someone else I need to talk to about gettin' hired on? Well, this is Crow's Landing. And I'm Chester Crow. So, can I stay? Well, that depends. Depends on what. How well the interview goes. What kind of an interview? When was the last time you had a nice clean bath and a place to spend the night? Never. Well, let's change that. Come on. Ladies first. We're not gonna fuck. I get that. MARY: Don't take another step towards me. Calm down. I just want a safe place to sleep tonight, and I'll be on my way in the morning. Look, how 'bout we just put that gun down, and discuss this. Look, if you shoot, every man, woman, and child down there is gonna hear that shot and they'll come runnin' up here. Especially, my brother Christopher. He doesn't take these things too lightly. This is a misunderstanding, that's all. I bet that bathwater over there's still warm! You want me to go and find that out for you? You're not gonna take a bath with me. Hey, I'll keep my back turned like a gentleman. Just know, if anything happens, Christopher will be up here and he's not nearly as gentleman-like as I am. I knew it. It's still warm. When was the last time you had a clean bath. Is that water clean? Well, it's not as dirty as it could be. Come on. You look like, you've had a bad day. It's been pretty bad. What's your name? Mary. Mary LaClede. Well, Mary, I tell you what. I'll keep my back turned. You slip out of those dirty rags and, take a nice, refreshing bath. You don't want me to look at you, I won't look at you. Keep the gun pointed at me if you like, but... just know if anything happens you won't make it outta this room alive. That is kinda nice. Told you. All your whores get their own bath? CHESTER: Well, customers like a clean whore. Well, most of 'em. Well, I take that back. Most of the men themselves haven't taken baths for weeks at a time and those are the clean ones. You don't have baths where you come from? I grew up on a plantation in New Orleans. They don't have baths in New Orleans? You never been? Nope. Can't say that I have. MARY: My God, that does feel good. Told ya'. You weren't lyin'. Do you mind if I do somethin' and you won't think it's strange? What? I have to make this bed squeak. What, why? Just stay put. You do this with all the girls? Well... Well... You start a brothel, you think... you think this is gonna be amazing. Then after a while it just... becomes like anything else. You get to know the girls, and... just kinda loses its luster, you know? Just becomes like, a job. It's a lot of work. You try to keep everybody happy. But the truth is... nobody's ever happy. Not in this world, anyway. Sounds like you been doin' this a long time. CHESTER: Yeah, well, we were raised in a brothel back East. Then one day my brother just got up and said, "Hey, we're gettin' outta here, you and me. We're headed West. A place where we can do whatever we want. And a land where we don't have to spend every waking moment of our lives in a stinking brothel." Well, when we headed out West, gold wasn't as easy to find as everyone made it sound. You see that... everyone made it sound like it was as easy as pickin' an apple from a tree. Well, it wasn't. Truth is... it's a lot of hard work... and there's not as much of it as everyone said there was. So, we just decided to take the gold from the people who could find it. They always say do what you know, right? So, lo and behold, here we are. -In another stinking brothel. But... it's easy to do. You keep the girls happy, you keep the patrons happy, and everybody's happy. Instead of diggin' for gold... they just hand it over to you. I thought you said no one's ever happy. Eh, I don't know. Maybe I'm just gettin' too old for the pleasures of this life. You look like just a boy to me. There, I think that's rather believable. So, what now? Well, now you get a good night's rest. I'll leave the back door unlocked, but be out as early as you can. Christopher's an early riser. Where am I gonna go? Well, that's up to you. Go anywhere you want. You're the first person to ever say that to me. Well, Miss Mary... if I don't ever see you again... it has been my pleasure having pretend sex with you. Pleasure was all mine. MARY: If I don't leave in the mornin', what would happen? Well, you'd be put to work... earn your own food and board and anything extra you might earn. Would I have to whore? I'm sorry to say this but... you are far too pretty to be put in the kitchen. Why are you lettin' me leave? Because the good ones get away. I'm not a good person. So, you want to work here? Where am I gonna go? I don't know. Do you mind if I read these? You can read? Mm-hmm. My father owned the plantation, and my mother was one of his slaves. When I was born he could've freed me, but he didn't. He just kept me there. He owned me. He had a legitimate son, a white son, with his wife, by the name of Francisco. He was the only person in this whole world that was ever kind to me. And he taught me to read, even though that was illegal, he would read me books all the time. The books... and stories... to let me escape. What was your favorite one? -You'll laugh. - No, come on. Tell me, what is it? Frankenstein! You ever read it? It's pretty dark. Sounds German. It's English. Franken-stein. It sounds German to me. Oh yes, Frankenstein the name. But the novelist is English. It was my big brother's favorite book, too. It's about life and death... and no matter what's created in this world, we all wanna be loved. MARY: And if that love is not returned... we can do some pretty horrible things. Well... don't be here in the morning. It's a big world out there. JACQUELINE: All right. All right. This is my stop. What do you mean? This is where I'm meetin' my dad. That was your father? Look, there's a mission about two miles up that way, if you hurry, you should be able to make it there before you give birth. The Sisters of Mercy'll be able to help you. You're just gonna let me go? Like I said, this is my stop. God, Mary, I'm so sorry. MAN: What happened? Are you shot? Are you giving birth? She said there would be Sisters of Mercy here. She said two miles out of town there's a mission. That they would help me. But there's no one here. There is a mission about a mile or so back, I saw it comin' in on the train. SCARLET: Can you help me? Please. Of course, of course. Let's take a look at that arm. GRANT: The bullet is still lodged inside. We're gonna have to dig it out. There's no time, -the baby's coming soon. -Okay. Can you walk? Yes. Let's get you up and walkin'. Let's get you to that mission. GRANT: I'll get you there, I promise. SCARLET: In one piece? In one piece. Grace... Please don't let me die. Not today. Not like this. SCARLET: Can we stop for a second? I can barely breathe. GRANT: Just sit down. What's your name? Grant. Grant Morgan. -You? -Scarlet. Scarlet Winchester. GRANT: Where you from, Scarlet Winchester? New Orleans. Well, Mrs. Winchester. We're gonna get you to that mission. Don't you worry for one second, okay? Then we'll get that bullet out of ya', then you're gonna give birth to whatever beautiful baby you're about to give birth to. You hear me? Yes. GRANT: Good. You think it's a girl or a boy? I don't know. I'm bettin' it's a girl. What makes you so sure? Call it father's intuition. You're a father? Yes, Ma'am. SCARLET: How many children do you have? Just the one. Beautiful baby girl. It's okay... I'm not a leper or anything. We don't really do that where I come from. The South. Mm-hmm. That's fine. See? Tastes the same. I guess so. It's kinda weird though, right? Yeah. I guess so. You know, you don't have much of a Southern accent for somebody from New Orleans. That's because my father owned the plantation in New Orleans, but, he also owned factories up in Boston. We spent a lot of time up there. He liked the North. Said it was sophisticated. Always wanted me to marry a gentleman. I was supposed to marry a nice man. Then the war broke out and he headed South. He sent for me since he was worried we may never see each other again. What happened? When I got home... Confederate soldiers had hanged him in the front yard for being a Union sympathizer. Long story short, I don't want a Southern accent. Try to hide it as best I can. Did you fight? I did. Over in Illinois. Just across the Mississippi. Joined the Union. Saw my fair share. Why are you helping me? Most of you Southerners... don't realize that Abraham Lincoln only freed your slaves. I'm from Missouri. He didn't free me. No. He left me in chains. As the Union was breakin' up... a lot of the plantation owners to the North knew that change was comin'. They knew it was only a matter of time until all of the Northern States would outlaw slavery. Including Missouri. So... a lot of them decided to... sell off their slaves so they could make as much money as they could before it was too late. I watched my whole family... torn apart... and sold down the Mississippi. Me? I'm too old. They didn't sell me. My wife... my daughter. She'd be about your age, right now. You could be her... right now. With a bullet in her... on the verge of givin' birth out here in a desert in the middle of nowhere with nobody to help her. I'd like to think that someone would... help her. If she was in your situation. -SCARLET: Cole? -Who's this? Cole Henry. He was our driver. He set us up and got my husband killed. Put the gun... -down. -COLE: Listen, Listen, I know where their gold is. A lot of it. It's more than you can imagine. COLE: You sell her to me right now, and I'll give you half of that gold. -Sell her to you. -COLE: That's right. She's rich. GRANT: That's not gonna happen. You don't, she dies anyway. You sell her to me right now, and I'll give you half of that gold. I'm not sellin' anybody. We need to get going. Baby's coming. I don't wanna give birth out here among the rattlesnakes. Can I help you? GRANT: Yes, you have to. She's been shot. And, she's giving birth. NUN: Yes, of course, come in, come in. SCARLET: Whose room is this? Yours. NUN: Now let's have a look at this shoulder. Is that bullet still inside you? Yes. Well, we're gonna have to get that out, before it gets infected. NUN: Oh my gosh, you're burning up, dear. There's no time. The baby's coming! Right now! NUN: Get her to breathe! Can you breathe for me! Breathe like this, whoof, one, two, three. -NUN: One, two, three. -One, two, three. Strange day, huh? GRANT: Nah. It's just another regular afternoon. Tell me about your husband. Oh, God. Francisco. SCARLET: When they killed my father Francisco stepped in and said he would take care of me. He said if I married him he'd keep the plantation in the family. GRANT: Sounds like a good man. -Yeah. You obviously didn't meet my husband. Most people said he was the devil. -Is everything okay? -NUN: You, out! Something's wrong! NUN: You out. Out now! I'll be right outside if you need me, okay? NUN: Push! I'm just too tired. Ah, I think I've lost too much blood. You can't give up, not now. You're so close, so close! And you are a fighter, I can tell. I've seen my fair share of fighters in this world, so I know when I'm looking at one, and you are a fighter! You're braver than you think you are! Now, push! NUN: You're doing so good, so good! -That's it! Another push! How long was I out? Well, look who it is. What are you doin' here? You must've worn the pretty little thing out. Mary, what are you still doin' here? CHRISTOPHER: She works here now you idiot! Least that's what you told me. -I thought I might stay. -But why? -Is she here? -EMERY: Yes! And my money? I presume it's with her? At the brothel. Across the street. Your daughter's at a brothel. Please, stop. Well, hello! JACQUELINE: So. How much do I owe you? Well. Being that I am the owner of this establishment, I think that makes me the most expensive item on the menu. -You! Ask and you shall receive. MARY: Hey! Jacqueline! -Push! Push! -Push! Fuck! That was unexpected. I'll say. Oh, that really hurts. -Hey. -CHESTER: Yeah? Before we die I just wanted to say-- Shh. -Shh, no. -I just wanted to say-- We're not gonna die. I just wanted to say... I think I really like you. CHESTER: That's nice. I think I really like you, too. I guess it's true what you said. CHESTER: What's that? That only the good ones get away. Do you think we'll get away? MARY: And no matter what's created in this world, we all wanna be loved. And if that love is not returned... we can do some pretty horrible things. GRANT: Heavenly Father... I have never asked for much. This world... this life... I won't lie. There have been hardships. A harder life than I ever thought any man was able to endure. But I have endured, Lord you know I have endured. But this? This is supposed to be a new beginning. Please. Lord, please. Don't let this happen. That woman in there, she needs you.
