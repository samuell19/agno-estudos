It's pouring rain. They have buried you alive. The villain is getting drunk, watching a movie on TV, revelling in confidence that he is the mightiest now. Suddenly, a loud noise! The villain turns back. As he looks around, someone strikes him hard on the head with a heavy object! Blood gushes out from the wound! The glass in his hand falls in high speed and shatters into pieces. A reflection of a face appears on the broken glass piece. And it is yours! You stand there in murderous rage! He turns around to check whose face it is. He's stupefied, wondering how you escaped! At the brink of that suspense, he drops dead, just like that! A close-up shot of the heavy object in your hand. Cut that shot... and straight to your eyes. A raging fire burns fiercely in your eyes! The camera moves into that fire... and you see the title, "The Rain of Fire continues". Then we show the director's name and that's it, sir. Nice. Thank you, sir. But... there's a correction. Tell me, sir. We can change whatever you want. They are burying me alive in the ground, correct? Yes, sir. After they bury me... I rise up, ripping apart the earth! - Argh! - Okay, sir. Like Superman! And with great vigour... I beat the villain to death! I'm angry and violent! I'll smash his head like a fruit... Argh! And I tear his head apart like this! Imagine the fruit pulp coming out.... blood splashing all over, from his eyes, ears and nose! Awesome, sir! - Sir, look here! - What?! I've got goosebumps! - Goosebumps! - Magnificent, isn't it? After all, who cares about the director? The audience only want to watch action heroes like me. Go and meet the producer, tell him you met me. Okay, sir. If he asks, just give him a one liner, not the whole story. - He talks a lot! - Alright, sir. By the way, how's your dad? He's good, sir. I'll ask him to call you. Nah! - Just convey my regards. - Okay, sir. Thank you very much. [Movie running on TV] [Gunshot] 'YUGI' [Guess] 'BEFORE A FEW MONTHS...' [Phone rings] Hello Nandakumar. Purushothaman sir?! Yes. Where are you now, sir? A lion is a king only when he's in the jungle. All those days are over, Nanda. You know what happened, right? Yes, sir. You've helped me a lot while I was in service. Now, once again, I need your help. Tell me, sir. We need to find a girl. I don't know where she has disappeared to or what happened to her. I'm all confused. I got my close circle to investigate. But there’s no information. And now finally, I'm here to seek your help. But Nanda, make sure this stays a secret. Sir, you've huge influence in the police department. You can easily figure this out, right? Why so secretive? Sir? If you can't talk about it, no issues. It's not that I can't talk about it, Nanda. They are trying to finish me off using that girl as a weapon. Which is why I'm seeking your help. You need to save me from a pack of wolves that are eagerly waiting to hunt me down. Understood, sir. You just find the girl. I'll see to the rest. Don't worry, sir. I'll take care. A guy named Rajkumar will bring you her details. Okay, sir. I will compensate you however you wish. It's okay, sir. Rajkumar knows all the details. He's trustworthy. You may keep him for assistance. The matter is really serious, Nanda. Okay, sir. Keep it confidential. Yes, sir. [DEBATE ON TV] The Government only finds ways to harm its people! This Government works against its people! They pretend like they're helping the public and then act like servants of corporate heads. Thrimoorthi sir, wait a second... Let them say whatever they want! Finally, they will have to come to me only! Do you understand? I'll talk to you later. We need to recover our stolen antique idols that are worth millions! Be seated! We have to protect our heritage and culture. Look here! My BP has shot up! Are you listening? Thanks to their performance, even if our party flag isn't flying high in the wind, our dignity is definitely being tossed to the wind! What the hell are they doing? Vomiting out everything that comes in their mouth! Should have kept these guys under control! Look at the consequences! All the ministers are involved in this crime. We'll bring the evidence to prove it! Look how they convince the public by pinning the blame for their wrongdoings on us! We are the ruling party only for namesake! In fact we are scared little puppets! Mr. Narayanan Murthy, executive officer-in-charge of the temple, will give us more information about the stolen idols. As if all this trouble wasn't enough, these guys are poking around, reporting everything! The estimated value is over 16000 million. Are you happy now? Happy?! Listen to me... Before the election announcement, all these people must be behind bars. Otherwise, all of us will be screwed! What the hell is your guy doing? Meditating?! - Om Sri Swami! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! - Om Sri Swami! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! - Om Sri Swami! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! - O Kannimoola Ganapathi! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! - Om Sri Dharma Shastha! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! - Om Sri Ananda Sitare! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! - Om Sri Swami! - I seek refuge in you, Ayyappa! Swamiye Sharanam Ayyappa! Hey Swami... Isn't it wrong to beat up people during fasting? Who punishes the sinners? Swami (God) does. - Who am I? - Swami (pilgrim). - Swami Sharanam! - Swami Sharanam! Excuse me. Who are you here to meet? Nanda sir. Please be seated. Tell him Rajkumar is here. Sir, Rajkumar is here to see you. Okay, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Yes, tell me. Sir, - my wife sleeps with me during the night. - Okay. Suddenly, at midnight, she disappears. And in the morning, she's again sleeping beside me. During this time in between, I've no clue where she goes and when she's back. David, keep the details of that client from T. Nagar ready. Okay, Shalini. It's ready. I borrowed money to whoever know people of me and my wife, sir Sir, this place isn't what you think it is. Please leave. That rat jumped and kept running. Nobody could catch it. Oho! - Hold on, sir. Whom do you want to meet? - The mommy rat followed him... - Sir! - Aha! SI Rajkumar. Thank you. Come in, Sethu. What the hell is going on here?! What happened to your plans? Purushothaman is a mere dummy. This is the person we need, the key to everything! We have no information about this girl or her whereabouts. Purushothaman's business, benami contacts, smuggling, this girl was behind everything. According to what Purushothaman sir said, I asked around the street where that girl was supposedly staying. But no one there has ever seen such a girl. All the information we got about that girl is fake. Including her name. Perfectly planned without leaving any trace of evidence. Even this photo was taken from a selfie. Other than that, I couldn’t get a lot of details. But I feel there’s some big problem. Once she's caught, Purushothaman will automatically fall into our hands. It's my job to catch the girl. And your job is to make sure that this matter doesn't leak. I couldn't make any further movements as the investigation is supposed to be confidential. So, I was asked to handover this file to you. I'll nab that girl, at any cost. But if anyone tries to get in my way... Swami Sharanam! What the hell, man! Why's he talking like this?! Due to a personal reason, this case is very important to me. So... - for now, concentrate only on this case. - Sure, sir. - Okay? - Yes, sir. One more, please. - Swami Sharanam! - Swami Sharanam! Deepak, you said he's some big shot. But he seems like a temple-dweller eating offerings from different temples! Be careful when you talk! He will hear you! Yes, and ask us to investigate which temple is offering what! Shut up, man! Will you have some? No, thanks, sir. Come on, Abdul. Eat it. It's offering from the temple. What's our next plan, Swami? If he is using this woman to conduct such a big deal, either he must be closely related to her or they have some important association with each other. If we can get hold of Purushothaman's best friend, we can easily nab this nameless bestie of his! - So, nab that friend first. - Alright, Swami! Apparently, nobody in this area knows that girl. Yes sir, all of them are parroting the same thing. Sir? Could it be fake news that the girl was staying here? What we need is not news, but evidence! How can everyone say they don't know her? I find it strange. - Enquire properly. - Okay, Shalini. Why? Aren't you sitting idle here?! Can't you get the door? I'm going, honey. Who are you? What do you want? Why is everyone coming here with that photo? Don't you all have any other job? Scram! Now! Wow! Nice! Hello, madam. Are you with them? Look at them! Don't they look like real dimwits?! How can I answer to them? You tell me. Instead, if it was a dashing girl like you who came to question me, there's some logic and kick in it. I can answer to you! - Am I right? - Who's that?! - N... nothing! As usual! That's my maid. - As usual?! - You please carry on, my dear. How many times should we repeat it? Can't you understand? Why are you irritating us like this? Do one thing. Paste her photo on our wall. 'This girl has nothing to do with us. Please stop bothering us about her' We will write a note like this below it! Will that be enough? Look at him! As soon as a girl comes, he's out here giggling and wearing his stupid wig! I was just chit-chatting. Damn your chit-chat! - Hold this! Hold it! - You've embarrassed me! Scram! Come inside! I'll show you! Don't dare come here again searching for any girl! Alright, okay. Hey! Rajkumar! Catch them. Catch him! Go! Go! Fast! Fast! Take a right. Hey! Shit! Why did he go in the other direction?! Pavithra... Pavithra... Let go of me! Leave me! Leave me! - Leave! - It's nothing! Don't worry. Hold me. It's okay. It's okay. Don't touch me. Get your hands off me. Let go of me! Keep you leg here. Here! Sit here. Leave me! Take your hands off me! Sit, dear. Let me check if you are hurt. Hey! Leave me. Hey, don't fall. - It's enough. Leave me. - Alright. Just this one medicine. That's it. It's okay. - Have a little... - Leave me. At least drink this. Sir, why have we come here? This is where we should start. Wait. Come in, sir! Cutting or shaving? Hey! Hello auditor! - It'll be good if you don't move. - Who are you? I'm here to see Purushothaman sir. He's not here. - You are? - My name is Nanda. I wanted to speak to him about a project. I was unable to reach him. He isn't home, but our son is. Please come in. Selvam! Selvam! Someone's here to see Dad. Apparently, an auditor will know all the secrets of his client. Is that true? Not just that, it seems, you threatened my guys? Tell me, where's that girl? If you tell the truth, I will only cut off what's required. Or else I'll cut off whatever I feel like! Oh, Dad is away, travelling on work. You can give me the details, I will call him and tell. Sure. This is my business card. Ask him to contact me on this number. What are you doing? I am a film director. I'm waiting to tell a story to a leading hero. Oh, nice! Have some coffee. I don't know anything about that. She managed all the dealings. We've only met each other three times. That too only to talk about the dealings. I don't know anything-- So why don't we take it all off? Hey! Spit out the truth, man! Each time, we met in a different area. And it was always in a public place. There is no way to contact her. I swear! Nothing else? Service charge! Swami Sharanam! Did we get any clue, sir? I'll tell you. "Sharpen your mind To seize the pulse on his face" "Grab hold of the enemy’s neck Strip away the crime" "So rare, so rare! So rare to see!" "The invisible disappears without a trace!" "Guess who, guess what! Guess it right!" "Let’s solve this mystery! Quick, take a guess!" Brother, have you seen this girl? No, I haven't, dear. "Let’s solve this mystery! Quick, take a guess!" - Have you seen this girl? - No, sir. Hey! Who are you guys?! How did you get in? Bro, he's engrossed in some "very important work"! - Get out! - Seems like! "If truth fails Will morality survive?" "Will virtue stray from its path time after time?" "Will right and wrong become one?" "Will the sin of killing be washed away if it was slaughtered for meat?" "In the nest of crows The cuckoo lays its eggs" "The cripple carries wild honey high up from the mountains" "Souls swapping bodies" "Is there anyone here who has mastered that ruse?" "Nothing can survive" "This blazing fire!" Sir... The call history and data of the mobile number she used has been erased, sir. Okay. If we can find out the relationship between Purushothaman sir and that girl, we can begin an investigation in that angle. Sir, we have checked Government records and social media, there's no information on that girl anywhere. Rajkumar... How did you get involved in this idol smuggling case? I was suspended on the basis of doubt. I have given my explanation letter. Will be back on duty soon. Come, let's go. Come on, blow, man! Blow hard! Here's a red one, blow it up. Blow it up nicely! 54. Bro, give him a big balloon. Here! Blow this one. Didn't Purushothaman and you go cycling together every week? If you spill out all his secrets, you can stop blowing this balloon. On our way from Vadapalani to ECR, he sometimes changes his route. I come back by myself and then we see each other only the week after. He doesn't share any of his secrets with me, sir. Sir. What brings you here, sir? I would have come if you just called me. We were in the area. Why?! Are we not welcome? Nothing like that, sir. Please be seated. My wife's sleeping. Let me wake her up. - No, no! - Pavi... It's okay... let her sleep. Hey, Raghav, no! Hey Scooby! Shush! - You should've warned about the dog! - Sorry, I forgot! He would've snapped my arm off! - Coffee or something to drink, sir? - No, nothing. We've got some work. Come Rajkumar, we can be back soon. Just two minutes. What happened to your wife? Soon after our marriage, she met with a major accident. She was injured in the head. The nerves in her brain are damaged. They said it was impossible to save her. But somehow, she fought and survived. She cannot walk because of the head injury. And she's mentally disturbed too. - Scooby! - Yes, David, tell me. Sir, I'm at the spot. Okay, wait right there. How are you managing all this by yourself? If it was anyone else in your place... there's no way they could do all this. She's my wife. If we had a child I would be doing all these things. I think of her as my child. Why don't you hire someone to help you out? We tried but it wasn't working out. I always feel like no one else can take care of her as well as I do. If it had happened to me, she would've done an even better job of taking care of me! Sorry, I'll be back in two minutes. Let's go? "You are a poem penned by God for me" "I ask myself, what more do I want in life?" "My heart lies asleep, buried in my eyes" "Everyday, I dream of you" "You are the other half to my whole" "O chattering rain!" "Shall I get drenched in you?" "Like flowers, your beautiful lips" "Shall I kiss your petals?" "Like a shadow on the streets" "Shall we drift away?" "Under this evening moon" "Shall we disappear?" "Your glances seek me" "And my steps seek you" "Together we write the story of A never-ending journey" "Like water in the roots" "I become one with you" "It was fate that I lost myself in you" "After ten blissful months" "Sheltered in my mother's womb" "And now, you are my life and my sanctuary!" "That's all..." "That's all I need, my dear" "O chattering rain!" "Shall I get drenched in you?" "Like flowers, your beautiful lips" "Shall I kiss your petals?" "Like a shadow on the streets" "Shall we drift away?" "Under this evening moon" "Shall we disappear?" Shalini? Lost in dreams, huh? Come out. He has left, sir. - Confirmed? - Yes, sir. Forum mall, ten o'clock movie. Sir, that movie is just amazing! Feeling hot hot! You already floored me with your photo! Looks like you'll sweep me away in video call! Come soon! Should I go first or you? Me? Look here! Come on, here you go! - Yuck! - Pathetic! Who the hell are you?! How did you come in here? He's so close to his expiry date and look at him dance! It's a dead lizard! - A lizard? - Yeah, that's what. Leave me! Hey Maarimuthu! You should be playing with your grandkids in this age instead of seeking exotic women. Hey! Who are you guys?! Are you trying to blackmail me? Better stop this and leave! I can easily get you guys locked up! Do you know who I am? Oh, my mother! Lift him up, bro! Get up, get up! What's with the tone, huh?! Do you know who I am? I'll snap your head off! Why is the door open? Did you forget to lock up the house properly in the excitement of going to the movies? - Both of you go freshen up and sleep. - Okay, Mom. - Who are they? - Who are you, sir? How did you break in? Who are they? How did they get in? How will I know? Who are you, sir? Come on, call the cops. Yes, wait... Quick! Call them! - Hey, what! - Hello? Give back the phone. Who are you, huh? - Who are these people? - What's happening here? - Come, we'll tell you. - Where are you taking us? - Come on, kids. - Daddy! - Who are these people? - Hello, let go of the kids! Hey, tell them to leave the kids! Come on, sit down. - Leave me - Hey, just tell them! Sir! Let go of my hand! Who are you guys? He looks like a cop... He has not said a word until now... Why has he come to our house? Hey! The price for keeping one video of yours a secret will cost you two of Purushothaman's secrets. Just don't tell me you don't know anything! Understood? If not, this video will spread like wildfire! Is that okay? Come on, tell! I'll tell... Purushothaman had an affair with a woman called Stella. And suddenly he tells me they got married... HEY! Speak up, man! What the hell! And, one day, suddenly he tells me they were married. A few months back, I heard she passed away. I don't know anything else about Stella. Where did Stella live? Anna Nagar, but I've never been there. He has been staring for so long. Okay, let's go. Sir! Are you playing games? You don't say anything, break into my house and just leave? Tell me what it is, sir! But you already said everything. Me?! I didn't say anything. What did I say?! Don't lie, sir. Tell me before you leave. Do you know what mesmerising means? What's that? You thought he was simply sitting in front of you? Look at his eyes. You have already said whatever you thought you shouldn't say! Without you even knowing! Huh? Me?! I haven't said anything! Tell me what I said! You've told me everything I needed to know! Huh, but I didn't say anything! Listen up, I'm telling you guys! This house I'm staying in, isn't my house! We have rented it. I don't know who the previous tenants were. It's only after we moved here we realised this house is haunted. When we asked the houseowner, he said if you want to live happily, tell everyone this is your own house. Where does this houseowner live? In Tiruvottriyur, his name is Kokki Kumar. He's a big shot, sir. And when did you meet him after that? Purushothaman and I never met that often... If he ever felt like eating non-veg, he would come and take me along. He really loves beef! So, I would go with him. Bro, is this what you call a secret?! Huh? - Looks like we lost the signal! - Swami... How you were dancing before! - Dad... - Tell me, dear. Where did the cat keep the rat, dear? Sir, what did I tell you by looking into your eyes? Please tell me, sir. Otherwise, I feel like my head will blow up! It's already blown up and stuck back together! Stop it, man! Please tell me, sir! Please! You didn't say anything before. But now you have. Huh? Why are you confusing me, sir? If anyone asks you if this is your house, tell them it is. Even if it's the police. Huh! So, you're not the police? When did I tell you I'm from the police? So, why was I blabbering then? Hold this. Here you go. This list has details of people by the name of Stella in our congregation. - Thank you, Father. - God bless. Yes, Swami. We've got it. We are coming. Okay, Swami. What a long list! How to find her in this? - You think we can? - Let's see. Also, it makes no sense to search for a woman from Anna Nagar in ECR! It's hard enough finding someone using a photo, let alone a name! As it is, he spends half the time listening to his daughter's story! He won't do anything without a plan. And don't talk ill about the child. If Swami finds out, he'll rip you apart. That's not his daughter, but his late sister's daughter. And for her, he's her father, remember that. - Everything is the Lord's blessing. - Indeed. Thank you for all the cooperation, Father. - Let me take your leave. - Praise the Lord. Greetings, Swami. I only like people who look me in the face and talk. Damn! I forgot to cut the call! This is a list of women over the age of 40-45 named Stella. And this is a list of women named Stella who have died in the last five years. We have already inquired about half the people on the list. Follow up with everyone on this list. I can't! You want to know what Kokki (loop) Kumar means? Because of the insane electricity bills, I use a loop to steal government electricity! You came this far searching for me thinking I am some rowdy because of my name? Hey George! You screwed me over cos I increased your rent, huh?! I'll show you, man! Who is this? Oh, no! Here they come! I was just climbing down! Now they want me to go up again! I can't do this! Who's that? Hey! Who are you, man? - What are you doing? - I'm breaking the rope of love! It's an ordinary rope, man! Make it fast, man! Look at you giving him directions on how to cut! Listen up, if you cut and I fall, I'll smash into smithereens like a pumpkin! And then you can't get any information from me. Then, tell the truth! Who's this new one? Tell him to stop cutting the rope. He's butchering it like meat! I'm scared, sir. You think this is funny? Tell me the truth! I will, sir. Do I even look like a houseowner? Even if I came to paint that house, people wouldn't believe me! The real owner of that house is in America. He thought I was some big shot rowdy and handed over his house to me and left. I was just guarding the house! Now I'm in trouble because you think it's my house! Hey, cut the rope! No! No! Don't cut the rope! I'll tell you everything. I was the one who gave her the house, sir. She stayed there for four months. She used to pay the rent on time. I don't know what happened or where she disappeared off to after that. She didn't even vacate the house. So many people have come in search of her. Since I didn't have the money to pay back her advance, I kept pretending like I didn't know her. That's all, sir. You idiot! I think I will fall now, man! Who all were staying with her? That... Even the driver is questioning me! Tell me, man! A nurse used to visit her frequently. What? A nurse?! Who else should visit a pregnant woman if not a nurse? Nayantara?! Who are you, ma'am? You look like a grapefruit wearing pants and a shirt! Sir, what the hell, sir? You even brought a girl to beat me up?! Am I that worthless?! Pregnant?! What's so hard to understand? And what about that girl's husband? I have no clue, sir. I heard that her husband was hospitalised after an accident. Let me go, sir. You could have just done a video call with me! I would have told you the whole truth, the absolute truth! Sir, please tell him to stop cutting the rope. Hey, cut the rope! - Okay, sir. - What?! Cut the rope?! Oh, no! Bro, this is the house, I guess. Why did Swami ask us to come here and inquire? Ring the bell. Did you know that she was married? - Did sir mention anything about this? - I don't know, sir. Perhaps Purushothaman sir himself did not know about it. Swami! How did he get inside?! I don't know, man! Who are these three subscribers coming out from that empty house? That's YouTuber 'Saappaadu Nathan'! - Who are you all, Swami? - Is that really him? We're their relatives. Where is the girl who was living here? Aren't you her relatives? Then, why ask me? Do you know this man? Of course! If I know her, I'll know her father too, right? Her father?! Her dad?! She's my daughter from my second wife. At this age, if people find out I have another family... you can imagine the scandal, right? Is there any way to contact Purushothaman sir? No, only if he calls us. You come, enquire and just leave?! Didn't Maarimuthu say that Stella lived in Anna Nagar? Purushothaman lied to Maarimuthu about Stella living in Anna Nagar. He cycles from Vadapalani to ECR along with Michael and avoids him only in one particular area. In this list, all Stellas have their husbands' names next to theirs. Except for this Stella, who only has her father's name. Daughter of Lourdes Periyaswami. Even the address match. Moreover, that YouTuber just connected the dots. Swami, I can give you some extra information. But in return, will you subscribe to my channel and hit the bell icon? Shall we, Swami? Yea, hit it, man! I asked you to hit the bell icon, right? Why are you hitting me instead? Oh, my mother! Where are you taking me? Sir, I need to go home. Can you please stop the jeep? Sir, stop the jeep! We need to contact Purushothaman sir urgently. You have to come with us. Sir, I don't know anything. Stop the jeep now, I need to go. Sir, my wife is not well. I have to go. Please stop. Sir, I asked you to stop! Why are you yelling? We just got an important lead in the case! And in this crucial time, you're behaving like a child throwing tantrums to go home! - I said, stop! - Rajkumar, please! - I said stop. - Take your hand off! Sir! - I said take your hand off! - Sir! - What the! - Take your hand off! - Rajkumar! - What are you doing? Sir, I'm not your servant. I'm assisting you only as per his request. Stop the jeep, sir. Rajkumar, please... Move, Shalini! Sir! - Will you stop or not? - Take off your hands! Let go! Take your hands off! Rajkumar! Hey! No! What the hell! Are you insane?! Make way! Auto... Auto... Let's go, brother. Bro, my money? Here you go. Pavithra... Pavithra... Pavithra... Hey! Shalini, check all the hospitals in this area. - We need more information. Immediately! - Okay. We need details about this girl. Sorry sir, we don't provide patient details to outsiders. Excuse me. Have you seen the girl in this photo? Has this girl come here for treatment? No, madam. She hasn't come here. Hello. We've checked with all the hospitals in this area. No one has ever seen that girl here. Who all did you ask? I enquired with the doctors, nurses, reception and everyone. How would you get details from them? Tell me. You hang up now. I'll call you as soon as we find the girl. - Hang up, man. - Don't run. You'll fall. - Watch out! - Darling! Aha! I'm exhausted trying to get her to eat at least one spoon! - I can't handle her at all! - Are you that naughty? - Give me, I'll feed her, Mom. - You only handle your kid. Daddy, I've made a drawing. Good girl! Good girl! So, what had happened to that rat? Daddy, daddy... The mommy rat was looking for her baby rat, she kept searching and searching everywhere... and went and asked another rat. - That mommy rat... - Superb, my darling! said something without considering her feelings... I'm getting a call. Will listen to the rest after the call. Hey! - Swami. - Yo! What's that buffoon saying? He says that someone came looking for the girl, but he won't say who. Now he's doing a food vlog while eating biriyani as if he's come for a treat! Hi viewers, welcome to our channel. Today our challenge is to see how much I can eat! There's chicken biriyani, eggs, chicken leg pieces... - And chicken 65 too. - Here! Yeah, we've got more biriyani. And then we have onion raita, cucumber and dessert too. Shall we start? One... Two... Three... Start! It may struck in your throat Eat careful man Swami, what do we do now? Do one thing, share and subscribe to his channel right away! And don't forget to hit the bell button. - Okay, Swami. - Hey! Swami! Either he should spit out the truth or the biriyani he just ate! Do you get me? Yes, got it, Swami. Yes, madam? This girl often came here to buy medicines. Do you remember her? No, I haven't seen her. - I don't know her. - Has she come here for treatment? Ask someone else. A girl named Karthika is admitted here. I need to see her. One second, ma'am. Have you seen this girl here? - Nobody by that name is admitted here. - One second. This is the girl. No, I haven't seen her. No, there's no one like that. - Sure? - Sure. Raghav, did you get any clue? I enquired at every hospital here. No clue, Shalini. Alright. Connect the call to David. I've enquired at all the hospitals excluding Bharani, CMAX, Vijaya and Surya hospital. There's no information about the girl. Okay. I'm nearby. I'll go and check in Surya and CMAX hospital. You go to the remaining hospitals and inform us. - Quick! - Okay, Shalini. Have you seen this girl here? So many people come here every day. Who knows, madam! You can try asking that lady cleaning over there. Have you seen this girl around here? Yes, I have. She used to visit Dr. Chandrika. - Yes, ma'am? - I want to meet Dr. Chandrika. Now she must be at her private clinic. Okay. Can I have her number? I can give you the clinic number. Okay. Give me. Sir, the girl has met Dr. Chandrika, at CMAX Hospital several times. When I contacted the clinic, I was told the doctor went home. Her house is in Anna Nagar. Shall I go there? No, wait for me. Don't make any moves until I come. Okay, sir. - Shalini, please... - Rajkumar... We've got an important clue about Karthika. I have forwarded you an address. Come there imme-- My wife is sick. I can't come anywhere now. Please try to understand. Rajkumar, please! - Shalini, please hang up. - I'll manage Nanda sir. Tell me, Shalini. - David. - Tell me. We have got a lead in Karthika case. Okay. You coordinate with Raghav and get here immediately. I've sent you the location. Come soon. Eat this biriyani too! Pour some more curry. - Eat it up. - Here you go. Have the whole thing. Here's your leg piece. Chicken 65. Here's your dessert. And now, what? - The challenge is over! - Why?! - I'll tell you the truth. - Finally. That guy who came that day was of olive complexion. He was tall. He looked like a policeman. I asked him if he was a policeman, but he said no. I told him ten things and he barely said one word in return. He kept looking at me closely and I felt shy. Sorry, sir. I asked him to come here. Doctor's family is in Tambaram. She comes here to rest during her breaktime. Hmm, alright. Just check inside. Doctor... There's no one here, sir. Check if there is any evidence. What? Nothing, sir. There should be no evidence of us coming here. Okay. Okay? Looks like Purushothaman sir has entrusted a thief the keys to his house! - Tell me, Deepak. - Swami... We showed him photos of Purushothaman's family and friends. But he's saying it's none of them. Who was that visitor? Sir... - Clear all the evidence. - Okay, sir. - Including CCTV footage. - Yes, sir. Due to a personal reason, this case is very important to me. Someone had come a while back. And asked about this girl and Chandrika madam. There should be no evidence of us coming here. I heard that her husband was hospitalised after an accident. Wait for me. Don't make any moves until I come. Sister, my husband... I got a call that he is in the ICU after an accident. Wait a minute. Vinu... Hello! Hello ma'am! Please open! Sister, please open... Wait, wait... You cannot come inside. You can't come inside. Who are you? What do you want? - Whom do you want to see? - My husband... My husband is inside. You please wait. Dr. Chandrika will come, and you can see. Hello! Stop! You can't go there. Please understand. I said stop. Wait here. Madam will come. - Any better option? - We can try. You can't go inside. Doctor, what happened to my husband? What is this, sister? - What are you doing? - How is he now? Who are you? That accident case, she didn't listen. Just came inside. - Sorry, madam. - You come here. - I want to see him. - You first come outside, I will tell you. Don't cry. Please madam, tell me how he is. No one else came with you? No madam, it's only us both. Please, madam, you have to save my husband. Ok, dear, I understand. You sit here. Sit here, please. Whatever I am going to say, hear it patiently. Don't panic. Your husband has been seriously injured in the head. Severe bleeding. I have temporarily arrested it. But for further treatment, it will be costly here. If you can't manage, take him to some other hospital. The sooner you transfer him, the better it will be. - Ok? - Oh, no! Ma'am! Please, ma'am. You only have to save my husband, ma'am. We don't have anyone else here. - Please madam, I beg you... - Oh no! Please save my husband Somehow, please! Don't cry dear. I understand your problem. Normally there are so many formalities to even admit cases like these. But it's only cos his condition is critical, I got him admitted to the ICU. I don't have the rights to continue further treatment. My hands are tied. Get your relatives and take him to another hospital. Ma'am! Oh, my dear God! What shall I do? I don't have anyone else, sister. You heard what madam said, right? Please understand. Call someone and ask them to come soon. Sister, ours was a love marriage against the wishes of our family. They don't even know we are here. If they come to know about this, they won't even care. What happened, doctor? Her husband is admitted in our hospital. Road accident, condition is very critical. Poor girl. She has no one else. We can help, doctor. We feel she is a good option. Doctor, can we try speaking to her? Ok, let me try. I will go talk to her. I don't have any idea. - Come... - Ma'am... Sit down. You want water? Don't worry. Stop crying. We can save your husband. You saw the people in there. They have agreed to help you. Thanks a lot, ma'am. I won't forget this favour until I die! I will somehow payback this debt. Hey, that is not needed. But... They will bear the expenses of your husband's treatment, no matter how much it costs. You should do a small favour for them in return. The thing is, they have been married for 15 years and don't have a child. They have tried several treatments. But no use. Madam doesn't have the capacity to carry a child. They are getting trolled in the society for this. Despite having name and fame, he is very upset because of this. Um... that's why now... they have decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. A lot of women were ready for this, but they were not fully satisfied. When they are satisfied, the terms won't align. Ah... So... they are asking whether you can do it. Ma'am, how can I? Madam, I don't even know what it is. No madam, I can't do it. Madam, please. I can talk to them. Sister, what is this? We have not even begun our life together. Please, madam! You should save my husband. I am begging you. Somehow save my husband. Hey, I can't save your husband just because you are begging. Please... They have come, Godsend, saying they will help you, and you say no. See, this is not something that doesn't happen in the world. Anybody else would have snatched this opportunity immediately. Look dear, he is offering you a whole life. In return, you need to work for 8-9 months. That's it. Tell me if you are ready. - Make her understand. - Okay, ma'am. How can I, sister? I don't see any other options for you. His condition is getting critical as time passes. First, you save him. We shall deal with the consequences later. Don't worry about anything. Be strong and take a decision. Where are you from? Our native place is Kamuthi near Ramnad. How did your husband meet with this accident? He had just joined in a company as a technical assistant. He met with the accident on his way back home from office. Actually, let her be my responsibility. It's only because of what you said that I let her stay there. Make sure she doesn't use her phone much. Also, she shouldn't contact anyone else except you. And... cancel her old phone number and get her a new sim. - Okay, sir. - Thank you. "Like a fish washed ashore" You go, I will take care. "Waiting to be send back to sea" - "Like soaking raindrops, they fall" - Madam, come. "Why do these eyes well up with tears?" You stay here? Not seen you before. My husband is admitted here. - Can I see him? - What's the patient's name? There's improvement-- Karthika, why are you here? Come with me. Come. Come. Why did you come here? I told you to keep this matter a secret, right? - No one outside should know. - Good morning, madam. Yes, morning. Especially your husband. He should never know. Because society should think this child was born to Guruprasad and his wife. Understood? Madam herself is not coming outside of her house. You should also do the same. Now, leave. "You’re the only one I wanna talk about" "Till my last breath" "Why does my heart feel so heavy?" "A thousand questions running through my mind" "Until the day our eyes meet" - Come in, sister. - How are you, dear? Are you fine? Yes, I'm okay. "Will my tears run dry?" What happened, doctor? Karthika's husband is conscious. He keeps asking for his wife. What should we do? Until this child is born, they should not see each other. Not only that. You should make sure there are no issues because of her. "Like a fish washed ashore" "Waiting to be send back to sea" "Like soaking raindrops, they fall" Hello? Madam? Karthika, I am a little busy. Contact sister Nancy for anything. Okay? - Sorry. - Hello? Hello? Madam, one minute. "The sky hidden above this umbrella" "O how I long to see you!" "Like a fish washed ashore" "Waiting to be send back to sea" "Like soaking raindrops, they fall" "Why do these eyes well up with tears?" "Like soaking raindrops, they fall" Transfer the patient to the ward, sister. Okay. Please sign here, ma'am. Monitor the sugar level. Thanks, ma'am. - Karthika... - What happened, doctor? Any problem? - Nothing. - Why are you avoiding my calls? Come. I will tell you. What ma'am?. You are awfully silent. I don't know how to say this. Sir and madam had some big issues between them. And they broke up. They are not together now. I am also not able to reach him. I didn't know how to tell you this... Oh, you have stooped to this level! I am not staying with you even for a minute! How are you saying this so lightly? What will I do now? Tell me. I also don't have any idea. Where is my husband? I want to see him. I want to see him immediately. Ok, I will arrange. You go home now. I will take you to see him tomorrow. No. No. I want to see him now. - Take me now. - Karthika... I have one more surgery today. Ok, do one thing. I will take you to see him in the evening. Sister... - Send her home for now. - Okay, ma'am. I am taking her to see her husband in the evening. Ok, leave now. I trusted you as my own sister. Even after knowing the truth, why did you hide this from me? You should have told me. Cheat! It was your problem all along. But you cheated me and you ruined my life all these years. You took some random stranger's sperm, said it was yours and cheated me! Don't even have the ability to have a child and I dreamt of having a family with you-- Who do you think you are, huh? Oh, you have stooped to this level. I am not staying with you even for a minute! Hey! Baby... baby! - Let me go! - No, no, no! - Leave! - Please forgive me. - Let go of my hand! - Please! I made a mistake. For a child. Don't worry. You fear I will publicise it? I won't. Your fame and name won't get affected. But if you disturb me again... that will be it! Hello? Ma'am? You both cheated me, right? Ma'am, I... We are not together anymore. I don't want that child or anything! I have applied for divorce. If he doesn't agree for divorce... I will make sure his status is shredded in society. Hang up the phone! Sir, what will I say to Karthika? Doctor, I don't even have a wife now. Then why a child? Huh? Give her something and settle it. Please forgive me. All of them are cheating you. Your husband is not even under treatment now. Madam has transferred him somewhere so that you don't see him. You contact some press or media, only then can you find him. These people are not good people like you think. Please forgive me. - Where is the doctor? - She is upstairs. Another three months you should keep him there. Not more than that. I will shift him. We will see, sir. Hey! Why did you do this? I agreed to do this because I trusted you! Karthika, what do you mean? So, all of you were cheating me?! Where is my husband? - Um... - What did you do to him? Is he alive or not? Tell me! You are also a woman, right? Why did you do this? He is everything to me. We had dreams to have a family and live happily. I wanted to save him to preserve his dream! Why did you do this to me? Karthika... I want to see my husband right now! Otherwise, I will go to the media and reveal everything about that hero! I don't fear anything now. Please, Karthika, calm down. I told you I will take you to your husband. I want to see him now! Otherwise, I will do what I said! Okay. Okay. You wait outside. I will come now. Wait at the bus stop. I will come behind. Go! I said I will come. Argh! Sir, that girl Karthika came to the hospital and is adamant on seeing her husband. I can't manage anymore. Please tell me what to do. She is also threatening saying press, media, police, etc. Madam... you do this. Tell her you are taking her to meet her husband and come straight to my guest house. I will make her understand. Ok, coming. - Virugampakkam. - Let's go. Get in. Sir, this is what happened. I don't know anything else. I stopped working in that hospital. I will tell this truth anywhere. Thanks for the information. By the way... don't tell anyone else about this. Especially about her husband. - Hello? - Swami... Saappaadu Nathan is saying it was Rajkumar, the suspended SI, who came looking for the girl What shall we do now, Swami? Regarding Dr. Chandrika's suicide, her family commented that there is no chance of her committing suicide, and that the CCTV footage of her house gone missing seems suspicious...' - Tell me, Shalini. - Hello, Rajkumar? I want to meet you immediately. I want to discuss something important about sir. Can you please come to the metro station? - Please? - Ok, I'll be there. Are you sure that he is not at home? Yeah, I'm sure about it. He's gone out for some important work. Please answer the call. Nevermind. Hello? Sir, I've sent you the details of the servant you asked for. Alright. Okay. Here. Right here. Please take the jammer. - Here, hold this. - Give me. Give me the jammer. Oh, no! I have no idea, sir. I haven't seen anything. Trust me. Today, we need to find out who sir really is. Search thoroughly, Rajkumar. One afternoon, a woman came and created a havoc over there. That doctor was also there with her. Well, what will we do if your sir suddenly comes back? What's this? How can a cop himself be so scared? How will you catch a thief then? Yeah, you're right. Well, are you saying that sir himself has done all these things? Yes. Do you think that he wants us to look for that woman's evidence? He's trying to get rid of all the evidence through us. Why are you assuming all this? Not just that. I feel that sir himself is the husband of the woman we're looking for. His wife died in an accident, that's all he's ever told me about her. But there isn't even a photo of hers, here! That raised my suspicion. - Shalini... - Yeah? - Oh, no! - Sit down! - He's back! - You said he won't come! Hey! Shh... One afternoon, a woman came and created a havoc over there. That doctor was also there with her. What's up, doctor ma'am? How are you? Hey, how are you, dear? Did the doctor explain everything? Nothing to worry about! No problems at all! I'm here, right? I'll take care of everything! Where's my husband? I need to see him right away! Tell me! You can see him! Tell her, doctor! You may see him quite well! Wouldn't it be good if he sees you up the duff like this? Deliver a baby in the next 4-5 months. Then you two can stay happy after leaving the baby in some orphanage! - What'd you say, doctor? - I've told her. You don't have to tell me about all that! Are you gonna take me to my husband now, or not? I wanna see him right now! Or else... Why are you screaming? Huh? Do as I say! Got it? - Tell her, doctor! - I've told her already, sir. I listened to your words all this while. You were scheming and cheating me, huh? You think you can do anything because you have the money? If my husband doesn't come here now... I'll make sure the public knows what kind of a person you are! You're talking too much! Stop! Oh, no! Sir! Sir! Hold her, sir! Lift her up, sir! - Karthika! - Stop screaming! What are you doing, sir? Blackmailing me with the press and media? Sir! Leave her, sir! I'll make her understand. Leave her! What are you gonna say? Leave her, sir. You said there won't be any problems because of her! - Yeah, I said so. - I only should have managed her. Why are you mentioning those things now, sir? How would I know that you and ma'am would get separated and not want a baby anymore? What's her mistake in that, sir? Did she come for nothing? No, sir! So what? She's acting up too much! She agreed for everything and came, right? - How much money have I wasted on her? - Get up first, sir! She's pregnant, sir! Something bad might happen! Can I let go of my bigger plans for this small issue? I'll make her understand. Come with me, sir! She's pregnant. Something might happen to her. Get up and come, sir! She agreed to everything to save her husband, right? True, sir! But how can you do like this? - What's this, doctor? - It was settled, sir! Why this, then? I don't know, sir. We'll make her understand. Come. Get up and come, I said! Sir, for God's sake, get up! Can't you understand? I told I'll make her understand. It may cause some complication in her pregnancy. - Make her understand, it seems! - Please come, sir! I'll make her understand. Come here. Move aside! Go! Karthika! Karthika! Get up, dear! Get up! Get up! Why did you do this, sir? - Karthika? - Doctor ma'am... Plan and do something. She died, sir! Everything's over! What do I do now? Doctor ma'am... Did anyone see you when you came here with her? No... - Hello? - Hello, sir... How are you? It's been quite a while since we talked. - I'm fine. - Good, sir. What a surprise? You called me! You said your son had written a script, sir? It's all ready, sir. I thought of giving him some dates soon. So... thought of conveying this to you. I never expected that you'd call and tell me this, sir! Well... There's a small favour I need... Tell me. My housemaid... she stole something from here... I thought of enquiring, and raised my hand on her. She fell and passed away. If you can settle this issue without any problems... It'd be good, if you can take care of this... Hello... Sir? Any problem? No problems as such. There's only three months left for my retirement. I am already accused in the idol smuggling case. That's what I'm thinking. Oh... So... You can't...? Alright, let me see. Sure, thank you! Thank you, sir! Ask your son to call me, sir. I'll help him. - Okay. Sure. - Thank you! Sir... Her husband... One second. - Hello? - Chandrika speaking. - Tell me, ma'am! - I'm sending a patient there. Please create a record such that he is already an inmate there and make him stay there itself. - I'll sign the formalities. - I'll do it, ma'am. Murugan... We can't really keep him there. Neither can we let him go out. Got it? - Okay, ma'am! - I'll compensate you for everything. Okay, ma'am! At that night neelankuppam Kasi and his hench man bring that girl in car But I don't know what happened after that, sir. I stopped working there. Sir... Please spare me, sir... - Tell me! - I don't know anything, sir... I just followed DSP Purushothaman's instructions, sir! Hey, watch out! Hello... What? The death of actor, Guruprasad has shocked fans all around the globe. Our reporter, Devendran will shed more light on the incident. When did you come, sir? Why didn't you inform me? I had informed Rajkumar a week ago that I was coming. I reached last night only. And I'm getting arrested for Guruprasad's murder, in the morning! I can't understand. What the hell is going on? Sir... Please, sir. Sir, what is the connection between the two of you? - Sir? - Go to this place. Okay, sir! Hey, Raghav, no! Hey! Hey, wake up! Open your eyes! - Who are you? - Sir... Aren't you detective Nanda? Yeah. Who are you? - Where is Rajkumar? - Sir... I'm Rajkumar, sir! Give me a bottle of water. Purushothaman sir had asked me to pass this file to you. When I was coming to meet you, I got kidnapped and locked up here. This is the missing daughter of Purushothaman sir. My wife is sleeping. Let me wake her up. Excuse me. Do you know this person? No. [MIRROR IMAGE] TN O7 AH 8000 This is the person we need, the key to everything! - Sir? - Sundar, I've sent you a number. - Track that number. - Okay, sir. Quick! All the details about that guy are in here. Give it to me! Yeah? - That number is moving, sir. - Which area? Towards ECR side, sir. Alright. Okay. "Sharpen your mind To seize the pulse on his face" "Grab hold of the enemy’s neck Strip away the crime" "So rare, so rare! So rare to see!" "The invisible disappears without a trace!" "Guess who, guess what! Guess it right!" "Let’s solve this mystery! Quick, take a guess!" "Guess who, guess what! Guess it right!" "Let’s solve this mystery! Quick, take a guess!" Tell me. A shocking news, sir. I've sent you all the details on WhatsApp. Sir, that girl's husband-- Karthika. My wife. It was her name that kept me alive. We call some incidents in our life as... misfortunes. One such misfortune ruined my entire life. When I opened my eyes after that, I was in a mental hospital. 'Mental Hospital Chennai - 600054' Hey! Why have you tied me up? Hey! Release me! Karthika, for whom I meant the whole world, I don't even know where she is now. So I decided to escape from this place. Hey stop! I went to our house, but she wasn't there. After you met with the accident, she left to Vadapalani, saying that she got a house there. I tried calling her several times after that, but couldn't connect. My daughter's house at Guindy is unoccupied. I'll give you the key, you may stay there if you wish to. In the house where we started our life, she isn't there anymore. Sorry, I don't know. No, I've never seen her. I don't know, brother. No, brother. Karthika didn't come here, buddy. Search thoroughly. Else, lodge a complaint at the police station. I got to know that Karthika didn't go to our hometown either. Please help to find her fast, sir! You just lodged the complaint and you're already impatient? I'll inquire and let you know. You may leave. I already told you that I'd let you know if we get any leads. Get going, before the senior officer arrives. Son... if you trust their words and wait, your wife will be too old by the time you find her! Do you understand? Go and try on social media. Don't you get it? Leave now! Thanks, sir! Even after paying the bribe you are making me wander like this? Finish this off fast. - Shall I go now? - Yeah, sure. Good day, sir. - Isn't this case solved yet? - We're still searching, sir. - How many more days? - Son, you get going. Leave! Only after that, I got to know that the police was looking for me, because I escaped from the mental hospital. Hey, Why don't you answer your phone? What's the matter? Tell me. Remember the assignment we had at Vadapalani? A guy is at the police station, holding that girl's photo. Which girl? Remember Gangai Amman temple? The one we did as per DSP Purushothaman's orders? He's sitting with that girl's photo. Be alert. Catch him! Hey! Please don't! I search about DSP Purushothaman Moron! Screaming like a dog! Leave it! Purushothaman will come to us once we kidnap his daughter! Excuse me, sir? Whom do you want? I want to meet Purushothaman sir. - Which Purushothaman? - The DSP. There's no such person here. Can't you take an appointment when coming to meet a senior auditor? Who let you in here? Get out of here! Out! Now! Swami, the auditor is too arrogant! It's better if you come. No, haven't seen her. Don't know. Don't know, bro. - Never seen her. - I've not seen her. - Never seen her, bro. - Don't know, bro. Never seen her. Why are you carrying this girl's photo? Do you know her? - Do you know her? - Yeah, she used to live in this street. - Which house? - The one with blue color gate. Thanks, brother! Hold tight! Okay, Daddy. - Sir... - Hey! What do you want? They say she used to live in this house. Do you know her, sir? You already came here once, right? I don't know her. Now leave. Please look properly and tell me, sir! I said I don't know her! Now, leave! If you come back again, I'll complain to the police. Even Purushothaman sir's family don't know where he is. Then how would a mere driver like me know? Just now, two guys came looking for his daughter. Look over there. Those guys. Thanks brother... Hey! I noticed that the two guys whom I saw while looking for Purushothaman, were also enquiring something at the places I went, and later, following a red car. That car, right? Maintain a distance. Okay. - I wanna meet Purushothaman sir. - There's no such person here. Just a moment, ma'am. Hey! Who are you? - You leaving or shall I call the cops? - Please, ma'am! - Please listen to me! - Who are you? Get out! - Please don't shout, ma'am! - Just get out! Do what I say! - I wanna see him! - I'm asking you to get out! Just do what I say! Leave! Get out! Or else... To get my Karthika back, I didn't know any other option than holding this girl captive. Who are you? Why have you brought me here? You won't get any information from me. I want my wife back. To know where she is, your dad should come. Till then, it's your wish if you want to be a guest here or a captive. Leave me! Let go of me! I got to know that Purushothaman is looking for his daughter via SI Rajkumar, and that he asked detective Nanda for help. Who are you? I see you often here! Loitering around an empty house? What's the matter? Are you a cop? No. I disguised myself as SI Rajkumar and joined detective Nanda's team. He said she went missing, and he gave me her details and asked me to pass them to detective Nanda. That's why I was searching for that girl. - Rajkumar... - Tell me, sir. - I spoke to Nanda. - Okay, sir. Don't share any further details with him. Whatever he asks, just tell him you don't know. Alright, sir. Nanda is committed towards truth and justice. Be careful. A nurse? Who else should visit a pregnant woman if not a nurse? Nayantara?! When Kokki Kumar said that Karthika was pregnant,' It felt like my life was snatched and thrown away. Leave me! I won't! I've seen her, sir. Why are you standing here? Who are you waiting for? Where is Chandrika ma'am? She'll be at the operation theatre. I wandered around hospitals, looking for Karthika. That's when I got my clue, Dr. Chandrika. - Deepak! - Swami? I've sent you a mobile number. Track it and tell me wherever it goes. Sure, Swami. Actor Guruprasad's death has caused unrest among his fans all over. We are in front of the house where he was shot dead. His death has shocked his fans. We can see thousands of his fans gathering in front of his house. As more fans arrive, the police force is trying to control the mob. The initial inquiries suggest that Guruprasad was murdered. The involvement of Purushothaman in this case can be confirmed only after the inquest. He really tricked us, sir! We can't just let him go, sir! Sorry. I didn't know any other option. Look sir, he's trying to prove that he's mentally unstable. Do something to him, sir! You still don't get it, do you? He implied that we can't do anything to him, without saying it! I did it to save you! Honestly, I didn't expect any of this to happen! Please... Please spare me! Forgive me and let me go! She too would have pleaded the same way... Unintentional mistakes can be forgiven. But the intentional sins you committed? Hello? Tell me. Swami, Vengatesh Nagar! Where exactly from my point, track it and tell me! He is Sethu Manikyam. He's handling Purushothaman sir's case. He's from the CBI. - Get in. - Yes, sir. - Hello. - Swami... - Yes. - Now he's near you. Which area? In Vengatesh Nagar, 20 metres away from you, towards the right. Venga-- Just 20 metres away from you, Swami. Right hand side. Okay, I'll talk to you later. That girl... in that car? - Sir? - No! Just 20 metres away from you, Swami. The cat hid the baby rat in the mommy rat's house itself! No matter where you leave me after this, that gang who's looking for me won't let me live in peace. Sir... The girl we're looking for... No, she's not the one we're looking for! If the seeker is worthy, he has all the right to get what he seeks. There has been progress on actor Guruprasad's murder case. Investigation has revealed that the murder weapon belongs to the ex-DSP, Purushothaman. He is being questioned thoroughly by the police at a secret location. CBI officer Sethu Manikyam has nabbed the young woman, Pavithra, the brain behind the idol smuggling case. Sethu has been conducting an undercover operation for a long time focusing on Purushothaman to catch Pavithra. If child born to us will your family accepted?
