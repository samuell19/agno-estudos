When did you last use it? Ohhh! ¶ FRIDAY ON MY MIND ¶ Monday morning feels so bad ¶ Everybody seems to nag me ¶ Coming Tuesday I feel better ¶ Even my old man looks good ¶ Wednesday just don't go Thursday goes too slow ¶ What's he doing? ¶ I've got Friday on my mind ¶ Gonna have fun in the city ¶ Be with my girl, she's so pretty ¶ She looks fine tonight ¶ She is out of sight to me ¶ Tonight I'll spend my bread ¶ Tonight I'll lose my head ¶ Tonight I got to get toni-i-ight ¶ Monday I have Friday on my mind ¶ Do the five-day grind once more ¶ Dan? Pull me in. ¶ I know of nothin' else that bugs me ¶ More than workin' for the rich man ¶ Hey, I'll change that scene one day ¶ Today I might be mad ¶ Tomorrow I'll be glad ¶ 'Cause I've got Friday on my mind ¶ I'm gonna have fun in the city ¶ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ¶ Be with my girl, she's so pretty ¶ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na ¶ She looks fine tonight ¶ She is out of sight to me ¶ Tonight, I'll spend my bread Tonight... ¶ What ran over you? - Billy, you old bastard. - Too long. - Eva. - Frank. - Dan. - How are ya? Come on. Let's get this party started. Quick. They're here. Hi! Shit. You look beautiful, Mum. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello! - Welcome! Leo! - Alright? Hello. Hi, Bridget. Oh, thanks. Thanks, mate. Bridget! Leave your bags and come in. Let's go out on the terrace. - Billy! - All good? - Billy. Yes, very good. - You look really well. Oh, I don't know if I like the sound of that. Oh, my favourite goddaughter. I'm your only goddaughter. - How's your love life? - Oh. No, no love life. What's wrong with boys these days? I don't know. Have you met my brother? - Get off your phone. - Off your phone. - Dan, off the phone. - Off the phone. You can see the world from here. Wow. It's just so beautiful. Wow. This place is amazing. Frank! Come on! Holly's bringing someone. Are you alright? Bloody speedboat's stuffed so no fun on the doughnut. Refills? Pop! - Oh, yes. - I will. It's so beautiful. I'd forgotten. Don't tell me that's what I think it is. And what do you think it is? I think it's one of your projects which always seems like a good idea and never is. The tree house is still standing, isn't it? - You want to tell us? - We're building a pizza oven. Oh, God, no. Don't tell me I've come all the way from New Zealand to build you a pizza oven. Us. To build us a pizza oven. All of us. It's going to be bonding. No! No! Good luck with that. What was that? Why don't you just go and hand out the oysters instead of sitting on your arse? OK. Oh, hi, Holly. Come on through. - Thanks, Uncle Frankie. - Don't you bloody 'uncle' me. What's that, Uncle Frankie? Holly! - Hello. - Holly. Hello! Nice of you to test drive a new root at my birthday party. You are just jealous. - Everyone, this is Doug. - Welcome, Doug. Frank. - G'day, Frank. - Drink? She'll be right. I've got a beer in my esky, mate. Now a bloke's happy. - Cheers. - Cheers. Lunch is ready. Lunch. ¶ Wild thing ¶ You make my heart sing ¶ You make everything ¶ ¶ Wild thing I think I love you Ho, ho, ho, ho. ¶ But I want to know for sure ¶ Come on and hold me tight ¶ Come on and hold me tight... ¶ I love you! - Good one, Mummy. - You smashed it, Mum. Leo. Um, I just want to say thanks for coming all this way to celebrate my birthday. It means a lot to me. We may not have been the brightest or the best band in the world but we certainly had a lot of fun out there on the road. And you did make Rolling Stone's Most Promising of 1977, as you've never stopped telling us. And we did have a little hit there, for a moment. ¶ Fearless ¶ Fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ And even when the gigs dried up and we lost our creative drive and our bookings, and our voice, Holly's beautiful mum Roxy... Yeah, Mum! ..We found something else. I never found anything. Friendship. I know we don't get to see each other as much as we would like to, um... ..but when we do, I've got to say it's sort of wonderful. - To friendship. - Friendship. - To friendship. - To friendship. - Friendship. - And families. - Prehistoric friendship. - Jurassic friendship. - Friendship. - Alright, pass your plates. ¶ Those days were so sweet ¶ The best days of my life ¶ Yeah ¶ I wanna know, babe I wanna know, babe... ¶ - No, no, it's OK. All good. - Thank you... Ella. Dr Ella. She's the brains of the family. - Dad. - What? - It's embarrassing. - It's the truth. - More coffee, Mum? - Thanks. - How many sheep do you run? - Just over 15,000. I'm only running at half capacity at the moment. Dan. So what happened with art school? Can't draw. And the Communication thing? Can't write. Not good enough, anyway. So what are you good at? Skating. - Well, that's a start. - Yeah. I'm supposed to rev you up about the joys of journalistic life. Don't bother. Yeah. Couple of us actually have an idea for an app. Oh. What's that? It's like a skater hub, kind of thing. It's early days though. Wow. On trend, dude. - You follow your dreams. - Yeah. Dad wants me to follow his dreams. Go and become the great creative he failed to become. Listen, at your age it is your responsibility to ignore your father. In fact, it's pretty much your only responsibility. I'm here for you, dude. Thanks, Leo. Cheers. Ah, wouldn't it be much better over there? That's what I was thinking. It's a much better place for it. Well, it's the more obvious spot, ready-made for shade. It's going over here. Well, if you want to make a big mistake, go right ahead. You know what, it's his oven. If he wants to put it there, we won't give him a hard time. Jesus, can't you just hire someone, Frank? We can, but it's more fun if we do it. Look, this is gonna be a place to gather in a storm, to remember the community of those you love. Let's go surfin'. ¶ You make me feel so young ¶ You make me feel so spring has sprung ¶ We should be at the golf course. That's where the grown-ups are. Golf? I'm not 103, mate. Bloody close to it. Not until tomorrow. Yeah! ¶ I wanna go play hide-and-seek ¶ I wanna go and bounce the moon ¶ Just like a toy balloon ¶ You and I are just like a couple of tots ¶ Running across a meadow ¶ Picking up lots of forget-me-nots ¶ You make me feel so young... ¶ Hey, look at this. - Hey! - Hey! Hey, he's still got it. - Look at that. - Pretty good. Flat as a tack. I look pretty bloody good these days, you know, - for a young bloke. - Yeah, not bad. Look at that. Dunno what you're doing. ¶ When you say that you just can't hang on ¶ ¶ When you're letting go and want to run ¶ ¶ Don't back up all those bumpy roads we nearly chose ¶ It's easy ¶ It's easy ¶ 'Cause you're fearless You're fearless ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ Do you blokes mind? ¶ Fea-ear-less... ¶ Can you take amateur hour somewhere else please? Sorry. Yeah, well, you're scaring the children. - Sorry. - Yeah, sorry. - Who are they, Nana? - Some has-beens. Bloody hell. Doesn't take much to scare kids these days. I'm with her. You were bloody terrifying. That's Uncle Billy and Eva. That must've been when they first met. Leo. Dad's guns. You and your mum again. Oh, my God. Look at that. Remember that was after Mum died and I'd just moved in with you guys. Ouch! Will you stop it with the mosquitos! - What's the matter with you? - Drives me crazy. Didn't you get enough attention as babies or something? With Frank, it's sneezing. When he sneezes it's like a bomb going off. I just want to kill him. What about, 'Bless you. Sorry about your allergies'? You do it on purpose. - Leo... - Don't you dare. Leo's perfect. My thoughts exactly. Thank you, darling. See what you've got to look forward to, Doug? And her mother was a pain in the arse. Well, I know that. She wouldn't put up with your music taste. You know that Dougie's into a bit of Willie Nelson and the Carpenters? Turn it up. You love the Carpenters. Mama was blues, through and through. Yeah, different times. She'd like to be making your sort of money. Mm, and I'd like to be singing in a band instead of, ¶ We're happy little Vegemites ¶ As bright as bright can be... ¶ Hey! Nothing wrong with advertising. Some of us keep off the breadline with it. Actually, Billy just won an advertising prize. Yep. - Best Jingle of the Year. - Ah, it was bullshit. - Why are you denying it? - Let's hear it. Nah, nah, nah. Why do mozzies only love me? Someone has to. Shame about that chimney, Frank. ¶ PRETTY PAPA BLUES - Can I just have a go? - No. He's very serious when he's gaming. This is a very intense moment. See if you can teach him some manners, Caitlyn. It was a very important moment. Yes! I'm coming in. You are just as handsome as ever. How are you? I'm good now. Much better. Looking forward to getting back to work. We missed you. You know... ..I had a bit of a scare too. What? Yeah, it was bloody melanoma but it's fine. - No! - I'm clear. Leo, why didn't you tell us? Well, it's a bastard but we're survivors, you and I. But it changes you, doesn't it? Mm. I call it uninvited clarity. That's right. I don't feel the same about so many things now. No. Some things you think are important that just don't matter at all and other things... much more so. Yeah. What? Our agreement. I've rethought, Lottie. What? - Is that why you came? - No, no, no, wait. - Just hear me out. - You can't rethink, Leo. No, you're right, it's not rethinking, it's-it's what's unresolved. It's not unresolved. We resolved it 20 years ago. - You might have. - We all did. It's not the way I see it. Does Bridget know what you want? No. She'd be appalled. We had an agreement. We made a pact, Leo. And for good reasons. They're still good reasons. Yes, they are. But they're not good enough. - Give it to me! - I want a go! - Come here! - Give it! Give it! - Take it off me. - Give me the... - Take it! - Give me the phone! Give me the phone. Thank you. I'm going to talk to Frank. No, you will not. I'll talk to Frank. You coming, Dad? Yep. In a minute. Hey, we've found it, we've found it. Come and check out Billy's prizewinning baby. - What are you doing? - Don't be so modest, Billy. - Eva... - Come on, come on! Let's see! - You found it! - Come on. - Well done. - Come on. Gather round. - Great! - Alright. ¶ When you say that you just can't hang on ¶ Stop it. ¶ When you're letting go ¶ Shush! What is it? Oh, my God! ¶ Fearless ¶ Hey! Ella, shut up! ¶ Fearless ¶ Fea-ea-ea-ear-less. ¶ - Oh, wow. - Is this a joke, Billy? - Listen, Frank... - Jesus, Billy. - That's our song, you prick. - How could you do that? What's happened? Billy turned Fearless into a diapers ad. Diapers? What the fuck?! That was Mum's song. We sang that at her funeral, for God's sake. Can everyone just calm down? It's just a song. Exactly. The Rolling Stones used Start Me Up to sell Microsoft Windows. I'll bet Keith never sold it behind Mick's back. The Pacific Sideburns go down as the voice of incontinence! - What, ADULT diapers? - Nobody's going to see it. - Where's it playing? - Nowhere important. - Where's it playing, Billy? - Europe. Europe?! I wanted to ask you. I was trying to find the right time. You know there's no bloody right time! If Mum was here she would punch you, you fucker. There... There was a deadline. And we... I-I couldn't lose the gig. I needed something good, and fast. So you stole our only hit? What is the matter with you? Bloody hell, Bill! - I wrote it. - Not on your own, ya wanker! What do you care, Dad? You were just the manager. Hear, hear. Fuck! Good one, Eva. Adult diapers! I'm gonna vomit! ¶ It's a man's world ¶ This is a man's world ¶ It would be nothing ¶ No... ¶ Without a woman or a girl... ¶ I feel like such an idiot. I was just happy he'd won something. I mean, obviously, if I'd known, I... No-one is blaming you, Eva. Billy is just being a dick. You're not his keeper, Eva. It's just the male ego, it's this desperate need to succeed and it corrupts their judgment. I don't know if it's that, exactly. It's about what they've always dreamed of for themselves and... ..what they've turned out to be. Well, isn't that true for all of us? Yes, but we've learnt to keep our expectations in check. Oh, well, stuff that! Oh, I loved Billy's ego. There was something really sexy about his genuine self-confidence. But when they lose it, boy, don't they know it. Why did Frankie sell the business? Like, he lived for Swagger Gear. I-I begged him not to sell it. I mean, I was coping fine. It's... ..just.... you know Frank. There's no telling him. Silly bastard. And I haven't been too much fun myself. I think you've got a good reason not to have been a laugh a minute. Oh, it's those anti-oestrogen drugs. They make you miserable and snappy. And then you dry up like an old prune. Well, crack open the coconut oil. What? It's for more than just cooking. - Get out! - Yeah. It does wonders for the velcro vagina. It's true. I'll show you, if you like. Stop it! Anyway, I'm not on them anymore and I can already feel my whole body waking up. Whoo! - Yeah. - Look out, Frank! Ohhh! Don't even look at that. Why didn't you tell me? Fearless is 40 years old, for Christ's sake. Oh, well, sleep well then. Alright, then. I was ashamed. Look at us. Failed jingle writer and an ageing actress. A what? You're beautiful. You'll always be beautiful. But, come on, the world we live in. It's over for us. Oh, fuck off. No, go on. Fuck off. Where? Oh, I don't care. Just get out. Get out until you grow up. God! And turn the light out. And shut the door. I don't believe it! Oh, my God. Why are you so good to me? 'Cause you deserve it. I don't. And because since the second we met I've spent every waking moment working out how I could win you. Do you have any idea how much energy that takes? I'm sorry. I just had to be sure. So, are you? What? As sure as I am. Have you got any of that energy left? Mm, maybe. Battle Of The Orcs. You awake? Mm-hm. What? I was talking to Leo. - Yeah. - And... - ..well, he says that... - Yeah? - ..That he... - What? ..He... ..had a cancer scare. Melanoma. Christ. Is he alright? Yeah. Why is Billy such an ungrateful bastard? He's resentful. He's broke. I flew them out here business class, didn't I? It was hard for him to accept it. Not so hard he declined the offer. Sometimes... ..you just need to let things go, Frank. And appreciate what's in front of you. You used to be so good at seizing the moment. I used to be good at a lot of things. What's up? Charlotte told me. Oh, geez, Frank. I'm sorry. I really should have told you first. You don't have to be sorry. I understand. You do? That's really good of you. To be honest, I didn't know how you'd react. How I'd react? Come here, you big dope. I love you, mate. I'm just glad you're alright. Oh, Frank, I really... I really appreciate that. You ARE alright? Hm? I mean, everything's good now? Y-yeah, I'm fine. It's fine. - That for me? - Yeah. - You having one? - Right. Yep. It's your handsome prince, rousing you from your slumber. Please don't kiss me. Anything you want to tell me? I'm... an idiot. And? I'm... ..sorry? Argh! Get off me! You have put on so much weight, you fat bastard. OK, girls, let's walk the dog. And breathing, step or jump in the feet towards the hands and roll up through the body into Anjali Mudra. Lift the face and the hands and salute the sun. And fold down the body into the plank. Inhale and exhale, heart over the hands, into Chaturanga. Breathing into upward dog and exhale into downward dog. Centre yourself. Oh, God! Tell yourself, 'I am enough.' - I'm enough. - I am enough. I've had enough! Engage with your deepest and most private place. Pepper! Don't blame Pepper, that was you! Oh, my God, that was really classy, Bridget. What, don't movie stars fart? No, never. Oh! It's not fair. That body at 60. It's not easy. I had to work at it. Well, however you did it, you're every bloke's fantasy. Oh. Well, maybe once. You know I've been... I've been approached to play a grandmother. - Oh, no. - Oh, what? And I have to fight for it. - Rubbish. - What's wrong with that? I think it's really cool to go from sex kitten to granny. She's too young to play a grandmother. Come on! 60's the new 40, you know. Yeah, sure, from behind and in the dark, Mum. Dream on, grannies, I'm done. I need a headache tablet. No! No, don't you dare! You horrible child! ¶ Strolling in the park ¶ Watching winter turn to spring ¶ Walking in the dark ¶ Seeing lovers do their thing ¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh That's the time ¶ I feel like making love to you ¶ That's the time ¶ I feel like making dreams... ¶ So you sold Swagger for a king's ransom but you couldn't stretch to an espresso machine, Frank. Gotta have something to leave the house for, Billy. Shame about that chimney. Just a tiny blip on paradise. How's the Mustang, Billy? Still going? - Sold it. - You sold it? You loved that jalopy. Well, you know, you move on. Your pride and joy. How could you? Well, Frankie, I wouldn't have bloody sold it if I didn't have to. OK. Must be easy to forget what normal life is like, Frank, but some of us still flinch when the bill comes. You're a chippy bastard. I'll buy your Mustang back for you. No. That's not what he wants. Yes, it is. Buy it for me, then. Doesn't mean anything to you, means the world to me. - Alright, I will. - Get stuffed. Listen, you little shit, I apologise for not making it as an artist, who we all know are superior beings. Who knew the world would want my T-shirts, but they did. I got a shitload of money for it and I'm not apologising. Exactly. No big deal. We all know it's more about luck than talent. Oh, shut up, Billy. Frank worked bloody hard to find and support artists. Don't be such a jerk. Lots of people work hard. They don't end up with a house in Palm Beach. Come on, Billy. Let's run off this lunch. - No, thanks. - I'll pay you for it. 'Cause after all, I'm just rolling in it. - You coming, Leo? - Come on, Uncle Billy. No, I'll help with the washing up. Oh, no help required. Did he say he would help with the washing up? I've got a few errands to run in Avalon anyway. - I'll give you a hand. - No! - No, I'm fine. - I insist. I think you need a nap. Do you? Well... Good boy. That's it. In you hop. ¶ LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL ¶ Hey, everybody ¶ Let's have some fun ¶ You only live but once and when you're dead you're done ¶ So let the good times roll ¶ Let the good times roll ¶ Don't care if you're young or old ¶ Get together Let the good times roll ¶ If it's too hot, don't push yourself. Oh, get stuffed. ¶ Yeah, no matter whether it's rainy weather ¶ Birds of a feather gotta stick together ¶ So get yourself under control ¶ Go out and get together and let the good times roll. ¶ I want Dan to do a DNA test. Fuck you, Leo. He deserves the truth. Besides, Frank's had him for 20 years. It's my turn. You've got a daughter. - Stepdaughter. - Pepper, stay. Come on, don't be ridiculous. That's like me saying to you, 'You have Ella and that's enough.' Ella's your flesh and blood. Well, so what? You're Caitlyn's dad in every way that's important. Here. Let me, let me. Look, Leo. Leo. Leo. Don't you remember? On the stairs, back in Newtown, you, me and Frank when I told you that there was just an infinitesimal chance and we all agreed that it wasn't worth losing what we had. And Frank, who, at that moment, had every reason to hate you, he said, 'If we don't know 'then it won't get in the way of any of us loving him.' And you agreed, Leo. You did. We all agreed. Don't you remember? Yes, I remember but this is 20 years later and I'm not who I was. Well, just be who you were! Ooh! - Hi, Charlotte. - Lorna. Leo - Lorna. Lorna - Leo. Hi, Leo. Um... Oh, are you a shrink too? - No. - Oh. Well, I don't mind telling you that this little lady saved my life, no, saved my life and it's not an exaggeration because I don't think I... - Lorna. - Well, I... Would you fuck off, please? Better be going. I think you'd better go too. I think you'd better find any excuse. Just go. I can't. You know that. Where are you going? Home. - What about the shopping? - Oh, fuck the shopping. Caitlyn just adores Leo. He's been a fantastic dad. She was just six years old when my first husband left. It's gonna be far worse when she loses Leo. Well, he hasn't gone yet. I know. I'm sorry. This wine makes me whine. Oh, you whine away, darling. Whine away. - You're so lucky. - Why? Well, Billy still loves you. I don't know where you get that idea. I can tell. The way he looks at you. Oh, he's just too vain to wear his glasses. All he sees is a blur! What happened to you? I'm not a pathological show-off, like some people I know. I'm definitely not 40 anymore. None of us are who we used to be. I used to be a musician. You used to be an unemployed musician. Now, I'm hired to flog nappies. Ah, you're an artist, Billy. I used to be always jealous of you blokes - talented bastards. All hail the conquering heroes. At least you have other things. I've never wanted kids. Now I look at yours. You have bloody great kids, Frank. Sometimes I think the only kids that do any good in life are the ones that have to overcome obstacles. My kids don't have any obstacles to overcome. Frank, you're 80 kilos of obstacle. 85. You know I can't even get it up anymore? Really? Not at all? They say it's not uncommon for blokes our age. Not me, mate. Right as rain. Like a steel rod. You're a bastard. Help! Help! We can't get down! Dougie to the rescue! - Stuck! The ladder... - My God, where's the ladder? - Could you please... - Whoa, whoa, hang on. - You right? - No, we're not alright. - What does it look like? - Watch your foot. Girls, for health and safety reasons I'll have to give you a random breath test. You two. Trouble, huh? - Come here. - Stop, I'm gonna pee. - No, no, no, no, don't. - No! Come back! You ready? Push yourself up, there you go. Yay! Dougie to the rescue! Oh, my God! So, do you think he's the one? I really like him. So do we. I can't see you on a sheep farm, Holly. Oh, I can. - Oh, that's serious. - Mm. Done. It's not lined up properly. Looks pretty good to me. That brick is not in the middle. - Yeah, it bloody is. - It's good enough. - It's good enough? - Yeah, it's good enough. We don't need this micromanaging, Frank. It's not the Opera House. If you're gonna do something, you do it well. Dan does not need encouragement to get sloppy. Frank, enough of the criticism, OK? Get stuffed, Leo. Hey, wasn't this supposed to be bonding? It's hard to bond with the Gestapo here. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know what's pissing you off but don't take it out on us. When do I get my yoga ball back? Tea's up, anyway. Hey, come on. Thanks, love. - Hello, ladies! - Bombs away! No! Wow! Look at that! Even though I say so myself, you've done well, Frank. Real shame about that chimney. Be bloody perfect otherwise. - Ta-da! - Oh, the famous scones. - Beautiful. - Delicious. Charlotte, thank you. Got ya! What the hell's that? Is that Dad? - Bloody hell. - What the hell's he doing? ¶ BORN TO BE WILD ¶ Get your motor running ¶ Head out on the highway ¶ What's going on? Come on, Dad! Frank's gone mad. ¶ And whatever comes our way ¶ Yeah, darlin' go make it happen ¶ Take the world in a love embrace ¶ Fire all of your guns at once ¶ And explode into space ¶ Born to be wild... ¶ Frank! FRANK! What are you doing, Frank? - Dad? - Frank! Come on down, Frank. Frank, get down before you kill yourself. He's gone mad! Frank, get down here! Don't let anyone come near me! Stop being an idiot. Frank, I'm coming up to get you. Billy, help them. It's your fault! - Why's it my fault? - It's always your fault! - Leo, hold the ladder. - You can fuck off! You're all fuckwits. I don't know why I invited you all. I hate you all. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. And I hate you more than anyone. No, you hate me more! - No, I hate him more. - He hates me more. Why'd you come? It's your bloody birthday and we're here to celebrate - the rational... - Mature. ..Mature, wise old bloke you've become. Come on! For God's sake, Frank. What will we say to the owners? We are the owners! What? I bought it yesterday. - Oh. - Did you know about this? Oh, God! Get away, I'm coming down. - Go on, get away! - Rightio. She didn't know about this. Frank. There. Happy now? Frank! Frank! - You bought a house? - So what if I did? Without talking to me! You just think you can fix everything with a chequebook. It bloody helps. You're a lunatic. It's my money! If I want to knock down a chimney, I will. 'My money'? You know I mean our money. Of course it's our money. I didn't buy the house. You didn't buy it? I enquired... about it. Why did you tell everybody you did? I don't know. I'll cancel the dinner tonight. No. No, I'll be fine. I know it means playing a grandmother but it can't hurt playing Nicole's mum, right, and the director's last film made a bomb for his studio. Great. Let's give it a go. - OK, well, we'll talk. - OK, thanks, Harry. She's 50, for Christ's sake. You can't play her mother. Well, apparently I can. It's your career. ¶ I've been loving you ¶ Too long ¶ To stop now ¶ Let's see. - You look so hot. - Let's go. - Give me a kiss. - Five minutes. Alright, everybody, let's go. - Ooh. - Dan's waiting in the boat. Let's go. Where's Frank? I'll go find him. Take that. Want to take this? Dad? Dad! Dad? Come on. You look lovely. Thanks. You OK? Never been better. Just give me a sec. Mum's in the car. ¶ ..Has been so wonderful ¶ I can't stop now ¶ ¶ You were tired ¶ Ahoy! ¶ And your love is growing cold ¶ My love is growing stronger ¶ As our affair, affair grows old ¶ Welcome aboard, sir. ¶ I've been loving you ¶ All too long ¶ You alright, Mum? ¶ To stop now ¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶ I've been loving you ¶ A little too long ¶ I don't want to stop now ¶ Oh, oh ¶ Don't make me stop now... ¶ That's a shame, babe. I was liking the sound of that. Dougie and I are actually quite compatible. We are at it three times a day. What's unusual about that? I can't think of anything worse. Oh, speech. Attention, please. Yes, I just want to say a few words to Dad. Oh, Dad. You are an obstinate, blinkered, anal, obstreperous, control freak. Hear, hear. That's nice. Must be my birthday. Let's not forget your shining moments. Let's see. When you forgot my dance performance, when you forgot my debating final. When you forgot my inter-school Tournament of the Minds Competition, which led to the State championships, which you missed. And then there was the time you told my school principal that she was full of shit. Well, she was. Or when you yelled at me after I missed that goal in the semi and then you got kicked out of the grounds. If you'd listened to me you would've got that goal. I guess that sometimes kids don't realise that their parents - well, you're people too, with hurts and struggles. And I just wanted to say that I wouldn't have got through med school without your support and encouragement and you're a really great father. - To Frank. - To Frank. Happy birthday. - We love you. - To Dad. We love you. Oh, that's nice. - Speech! - Speech! Come on, Frank. Thank you, darling, that was, um... That was beautiful. I'm a, ah, lucky fella. Ahhh... Excuse me, won't you? Dad. - Don't be sad. I love you. - And I love you too. - Will you open your presents? - All good, Dad? - What you got there? - Oh, look at that! - Funny. - What is it? Let me take the ribbon. I need a ribbon. Daniel. - What is that? - What do you reckon? - It's a monkey. - And he plays the drums. Where did you find that? Oh, that is ridiculous! Is it... It's a really old one. Where did you find that? How do you play it? ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ Happy birthday, dear Frank ¶ Happy birthday to you. ¶ - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Hip, hip! - Hooray! - Look at this! - Look at that. - Isn't that good? - Isn't that wonderful? Where's Dan? Oh, I think they went down to the pontoon. Oh! What is that? Who did that? Very good, thanks! Excuse me. I can't see. There we go. ¶ CATCH THE WIND ¶ In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty ¶ I want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind - ¶ To feel you all around me ¶ - Thank you. ¶ And to take your hand along the sand ¶ Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind ¶ When sundown pales the sky... ¶ ¶ I want to hide a while ¶ Behind your smile ¶ And everywhere I look your eyes I'd find ¶ For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing ¶ Would make me sing ¶ Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind. ¶ Shit! I hope our kids have your singing voice. Oops, that just... That popped out of nowhere, didn't it? Wow. I guess I'm asking you to marry me, Holl. You know, there's nothing I want more than to call you 'missus' and live happily ever after. I know that you do, Dougie. I'm sorry. I'm not the right person for you. - I've got the keys. - What did you get from Leo? What did you give me, Leo? What did he give me? He gave you the cognac, didn't he? Did he? It looks like it's between me and one other actress. Whoo-hoo! With a bit of luck, you might get to play a granny. ..Or you want to be a dog for the rest of your life? Hey. Hey. Thanks, Leo, for... for not saying anything. I haven't changed my mind. Frank must wonder himself. - He hasn't wondered. - Oh, that's bullshit. He has a problem with Dan and I'm pretty sure I know why. Lottie... ..nothing will change unless you force him to acknowledge it, just like he was forced to acknowledge what a crap husband he was all those years he was married to his bloody business. Oh, shush. It got better. It got better because one night you and I fell into bed. And Frank realised he had to lift his game, otherwise he'd lose you. It was much more than just a... It was much more than just a fling, Lottie. I was in love with you and you were... Ella! Ella, wait! Ella, wait! I need to talk to you. - Ella, Ella! Listen to me. - Mum, I don't want to hear it. Ella, it was 20 years ago! But you were married to Dad. We were going through something. You don't do that to someone you love. - No wonder he's depressed. - He's not depressed. He's just dealing with a lot of stuff. How often do you prescribe antidepressants to happy people? - I haven't prescribed them. - Well, someone has. What's going on? Eh? What's going on? Leo wants to know. - What? - Dan. I want to know, Frank. You serious? Yes, I am. I'm serious. Have you thought about what this is gonna do to Dan? Dan might be happy to know you're not his father. Did you think of that? Frank! Frank, stop it! - Stop! - You bastard. Stop! Stop it! No, no, no, no, no! Why don't you just talk about it? You treat him like shit! How the hell would you bloody know? Everyone knows. Stop it! He's my son, Frank, and you know it. Fuck you, Frank. Fuck you, Leo. Shut up! Don't get blood on the linen. Do you remember when we first met? What? Do you remember when we first met? Of course I do. It was at the Indiana Teahouse in Cottesloe. Nice try. It was on a plane from Karratha. You were covering a mining story and I was a... a single mum struggling with a very cranky six-year-old and I'd just lost my teaching job and I was transferring... ..back to... back to Perth. So? Sometimes I, ah... ..I think you fell in love with the idea of giving me a... ..a fairytale ending. I was in love with you, Bridget. Are you sure you didn't just want to save me? It's very different, you know. For God's sake, Bridget, what are you talking about? You already have a daughter... ..and a wife... ..who love you and want you. Jesus, Leo. What difference will knowing make? Do you want to talk about it? About what? Well, the pills you're taking, for starters. Talk to me, Frank. I should never have sold the business. Ever since I've sold it I've felt... ..dead. Do you think he's mine? I've always wondered. Billy. Billy. What are you doing? I'm leaving. I've had enough. One day I hope you wake up and realise that your life was pretty bloody good. Hey, hey, Eva, Eva, come on! We've gone through a lot of shit before this. I'm not gonna say goodbye. You tell them when I've left. They'll understand. - Open the window! - No. No. - Just give me 15 seconds. - No, keep going. - Please! - Oh, my God. Keep going. Stop, stop! - Oh, my God! - Eva, give me a chance. Just give me a chance, please. Eva, Eva, Eva... ..I don't know why but I sabotage every good thing and you're the best thing. And you're right. I'm selfish and ungrateful and... and miserably jealous. And all my shit is because I've always believed that I don't deserve you. Please forgive me. Please. - Don't believe him. - Shut up! Thanks. I'll deal with this. I'm not going to get out of this car... ..until you promise me... ..that the next ten years are going to be our best. I promise you. Cross my heart and hope to die. You don't deserve me. Billy. It's alright now, it's alright. Yeah, look, congratulations and everything but can I get a cancellation fee? - Yeah. - Yeah, um... Thanks. 20 bucks? I come from Dee Why, mate. - Oh, thanks, mate! - No, it's alright. - No, don't.... - Ohhh! - Yeah, OK. - Let him go. ¶ PAIN AND MISERY ¶ I've been in love, honey You know it's true ¶ Whoa, since that day I first laid my eyes on you ¶ Love is a crazy game, baby ¶ Is how I feel ¶ ¶ It can make you, oh, so high ¶ But it takes so long to heal ¶ So please, yeah, yeah ¶ Won't you stay with me ¶ 'Cause since you gone ¶ Pain and misery ¶ Honey, please, yeah, yeah ¶ Won't you stay with me ¶ 'Cause since you gone it's pain and misery ¶ Every day is pain ¶ In the end it's hard to see ¶ Every fateful day is oh, so sad ¶ Now that I've lost the best friend that I ever had... ¶ ¶ Seems I've got to have a change of scene ¶ 'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams ¶ Imprisoned by the way I could have been ¶ Left here on my own or so it seems ¶ I got to leave before I start to scream ¶ But someone locked the door ¶ And took the key ¶ You're feelin' alright? ¶ Ah-ha ¶ Not feelin' too good myself ¶ Ah-ha ¶ You're feelin' alright? ¶ Ah-ha ¶ I'm not feelin' too good myself ¶ Ah-ha ¶ You're feelin' alright? ¶ Ah-ha ¶ I'm not feelin' too good myself ¶ Ah-ha ¶ You're feelin' ... ¶ Whoo-hoo! Hey, Cait, come on. Let's go for a burn. 'Dad, can I go for a burn 'in the boat I buggered last time I used it?' Well? Course you can, darling. Do what you like. You always do. - You ready? - Yep. Away you go. ¶ You feelin' alright? ¶ Ah-ha ¶ I'm not feelin' too good myself ¶ Ah-ha - ¶ You feelin' alright? ¶ - Good? - ¶ Ah-ha - Yeah! ¶ I'm not feelin' that good myself ¶ - Whooo! - ¶ Ah-ha ¶ Boy, you sure took me for one big ride ¶ Even now I sit and I wonder why ¶ Mm, and when I think of you ¶ I sit down myself and cry ¶ I just can't waste my time ¶ I must keep dry ¶ Call me... ¶ Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan! Dan! - Frank! - Help! Frank, quick! No! Dougie. Um, do you have to go now? Just go tomorrow or... in the morning. I don't want to get in the way, Holl. You're family, you know? I'm not. Take care. What was that? Nothing to worry about. Why won't they tell us anything? If we lose him... ..I will never forgive myself. Frank. It was an accident. My last words to him, 'Do what you like. You always do.' Why did I say that? It's not the truth. I don't deserve him. - Caitlyn? - She's fine. I'm so sorry, Dad. No, no, no, mate, it's alright. I'm the one who's sorry. You gave us such a fright, darling. I'm sorry, Mum. - Dr Hall. - Frank Lowther. - This is Charlotte, Dan's... - Hello. Hello? OK. Thanks, Dad. He's got a broken shoulder but he's gonna be OK. Oh, darling. Oh. There you are. Oh. Oh, sweetheart. Oh. I love you. Dad! Are you alright? Yes, I am. It's going to be alright. Forgive me, I... I've been an idiot. - Watch your head, darling. - Yep. There. Thanks, Mum. From now on, mate, I'm out of your way. But I'm here whenever you need me. I'm not going to sit on my arse, Dad. I know. Shhh. - Thanks, Billy. - OK. Oh, Ella, he's sleeping now. He's going to be OK. You're right, Leo. - What? - Leo's right. Dan needs to know the truth. We all do. What do you mean? It has to be finished. We should've found out 20 years ago. What's going on? We'll do a DNA test, put it all to rest. Frank, listen, that's not necessary. Let sleeping dogs lie, for heaven's sake. Do it, Leo. Guys, you're all completely mad. Come on. Second-year genetics. Why didn't you just ask me? I've tested Dan's DNA, and mine. We have the same. 99.99 % chance he's my brother. If Leo's Dan's father, he's mine too. Mum? Not a chance. CLOSE TO YOU ¶ Why do birds suddenly appear ¶ And we'll all leave in the morning. ¶ Every time you are near ¶ Just like me they long to be ¶ Close to you ¶ Here comes the cavalry. Oh, you beauty! ¶ ..Fall down from the sky ¶ Every time you walk by Holl. Holl, you hungry? No, I'm fine, thanks. I think you are. ¶ On the day that you were born ¶ The angels got together ¶ And decided to create a dream come true ¶ So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold ¶ And starlight in your eyes of blue... ¶ Achoo! Achoo! Achoo! Achoo! Bless you, darling. I'm so sorry for your allergies. Oh, you are feeling better. Ah, they're quite useful. ¶ SOUL KIND OF FEELING ¶ Ooh ¶ It's just a soul kinda feeling ¶ A-movin' with the beat ¶ It's just a soul kinda feeling ¶ A-soundin' kinda sweet ¶ You might be sittin' alone in your room ¶ Hey, we've started. - Well? - No. Oh, no. Apparently they... They thought I looked too young to play Nicole's mother. - What? - Ohhh! I'm calling those brain-dead casting directors and tell them you'd be perfect. 'Should see her first thing in the morning,' I'll say. Under the right lights, she looks 102! Pizza's up! Oh, it smells fantastic! Congratulations. Absolutely wonderful. ¶ It might take you higher ¶ It might take you higher... ¶ - Look who I've got! - Hey, Pepper! Whoo-hoo! Not until you get off the phone. Wait, wait. Let me just fix the music. Hang on. - Hey, none of that rap crap. - Hang on, hang on. This is for you, Dad. Come on, beautiful. Put that down. We're on, here. We're on. Come on. ¶ When you say that you just can't hang on ¶ When you're letting go and want to run ¶ Don't back up all those bumpy roads we nearly chose ¶ It's easy ¶ It's easy ¶ 'Cause you're fearless You're fearless ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ When you're missing all those friends you made ¶ Friends and foes alike you made in sunshine and in shade ¶ And everything you are ¶ Should make you feel just like a star ¶ It's easy ¶ It's easy ¶ 'Cause you're fearless ¶ Fearless ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ 'Cause you're fearless ¶ You're fearless ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ When you're lying in the gutter ¶ Your life is all a-clutter ¶ You're fearing night and counting all the scars ¶ You'd better start counting stars ¶ 'Cause you're fearless ¶ You're fearless ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ You're fearless ¶ You're fearless ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less ¶ You're fea-ea-ea-ear-less. ¶ ¶ LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL ¶ Hey, everybody, let's have some fun ¶ You only live but once ¶ And when you're dead you're done ¶ So let the good times roll ¶ Let the good times roll ¶ Don't care if you're young or old ¶ Get together Let the good times roll ¶ Don't sit there mumblin' and talkin' trash ¶ If you wanna have a ball ¶ You gotta go out and spend some cash ¶ And let the good times roll ¶ Let the good times roll ¶ Don't care if you're young or old ¶ Get together Let the good times roll ¶ Hey, y'all, tell everybody Mr John's in town ¶ I got a dollar and a quarter ¶ And I'm just rarin' to clown ¶ But don't let nobody play me cheap ¶ I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep ¶ So let the good times roll ¶ Let the good times roll ¶ Don't care if you're young or old ¶ Get together Let the good times roll ¶ Yeah, no matter whether it's rainy weather ¶ Birds of a feather gotta stick together ¶ So get yourself under control ¶ Go out and get together and let the good times roll. ¶ Captions produced by Access Media Pty Ltd
