Heya Heya Heya Heya That's my great Indian word. Lots of people hear it all the time. Heya Heya, but my real name is Ana'oi. I was four years young. When my grandpa called me on Ana'oi it means grizzly spirit Thats why I'm faster that lightning and strong as thunder even though I'm crippled up I'm still the same way. I ran up in Seattle on and off for 10 years. And I was, I ran them streets. Hey, this is my family. Heya heya The river and the river front property our folks are very well versed to respond pretty much daily to that section of the city. That place has been there since 1945. It was hobo beach. Yeah. And I remember I was a teenager when the timber industry crashed and I remember loggers going door to door. And I remember people becoming homeless Finding in consideration of the event The city council finds the river street property in its current condition to be unfit for either human habitation, or open public access. This is purely a safety action. I know from the public hearing that there was a lot of comments about the homeless individuals that are on the property and implications this can have to them. And that's something that I definitely have a place in my heart for. And I definitely want to find better resolutions to help me address homelessness in this County and in this nation. I have worked with several different organizations to those ends. And I think the balance of what is of what is safest for the community and for the public's safety is the closure of the sight All right it is 7:18 call to order council meeting for April 24th. I was not at the at the meeting where the first reading was brought forward and this was brought forward on my behalf. And so I feel like I should provide a little bit of background as to the reasoning behind this. The riverfront property. We respond pretty much daily to that section of the city. Fire department responds there quite frequently as well for a variety of different medical issues, overdose related issues. And that's, unfortunately that occurs quite too often. You know, if this were a property that was safe I would be making a recommendation to council that we create a sanctioned facility there to take what is an ad hoc grouping of homeless individuals and turn into something that mirrors some of the facilities that exist in other parts of the state but it's not a safe property and it's never been a safe property. And there's a lot of data that's been collected over the last year that demonstrates that. We've had individuals who are within the community at the riverfront who have fell victim to crimes whether they're assaults or theft that occur, you know, to themselves we may respond to, it's just a, not a safe location. And then as you're aware, the female who lost both of her legs. You know, we're wrapping up this investigation. I hear what sounds like screaming, blood curdling scream some crazy what's going on. I heard that several blocks away generally towards the train tracks area. And so I saw a lady named Shauna bent down and it looked like a lady laying on the ground and saw that she was missing her leg. Where were her legs severed? Just below the knee, four inches below the knee. Keep her talking, you're going to be okay. You're going to be all right, keep talking keep breathing. on the other side, they're like, what's going on. People approaching. You're trying to get people to back away from the tracks because they're only putting themselves in danger. We were on the tracks at this moment too It's built into you You know, training experience was like by the numbers but it's really a chaotic moment, you know? And I think the balance of what is safest for the community and for the public's safety is, is the closure of the site. So that is why this has come before you and I'll leave it to the, the debate from the council. Is there any other comments? Seeing none all in favor? Aye. All opposed. Alright the aye's have it. We'll move to the third rating of the may eighth meeting. And with that, I believe we'll move to the public comment period. Please limit your comments to three minutes but it can be about anything It's never ending. There's no solution. You're just pushing it from one place to another. That's what we need to know. What is the solution? There still, hasn't been a solution. You guys haven't said anything about a solution. Its not going to be safe for us to walk our grandchildren. I'm not even comfortable walking downtown now to be honest with you. I was homeless for quite a while. Down on the river. Not only people's kids also the homeless people that are going to get into it with shop owners the person that is angry because we're out on the streets coming in the middle of the night and attacking us. As my daughter's case she lives down there full-time I brought her in my own home to help her, but in turn she's stolen from my family. Got herself kicked back out, and it would be great to have something being done. But for myself, I personally don't know what it would be because if they're not willing to help themselves. Then it's not our fault that they're there. It's what they've done. Not us. That's why I look at it. And most of you know my story. I'm a non-active recovered addict because the people that I love decided to choose to not enable me anymore. I hit rock bottom. And when I hit rock bottom I had to come up because there was nowhere else to go. There's beds at the mission open every night there's beds at friendship house open every night you can take a shower every day at the friendship house for free For certain hours of the day. What else are you doing? Okay. This isn't the Arsenio hall show, you're not the dog pound no hooting and hollering while the persons talking clapping afterwards is fine. But please, any comments while someone is testifying it's their turn to speak. You don't depend on a city and other citizens to take care of you. You gotta take care of yourself and you have to want to help yourself. And you gonna have to want to stop numbing yourself and face yourself and look in the mirror and love yourself so you can get better. Thank you. But that doesn't mean that everybody down on the river has denied help or doesn't want to help themselves or is just wanting to mooch off of everybody else because that's not the case. And for you to just to tell me that next week I don't have anywhere to go. Isn't fair. That's right. My name is Tom Davis. - ward or city? Which ward do you belong to? Or which city do you reside in? I'm an Aberdeen Bobcat, sir. I've been here approximate 30 years. And is it a problem to be homeless? Is it a problem of being a drug addict? Is it a problem of just being I have to sabotage myself every time things start going good I'm going to screw it up. Maybe I want to be out there on my own. Maybe this is the best I can do. Maybe I don't have any training maybe jobs aren't available. Maybe I'm not really able to communicate with the city the County so forth but I think it has to do with the perception. I can give you guys one chance just to be out there for a month. That's right preach it. and see how you would like to be looked at. Its KBKW's coffee talk It is now 7:13. And we have in the control room here, not only two of our guests, but also camera's and everything else. So it should be interesting because this broadcast part of it might even show up on the documentary film or the documentary film The River. And with us this morning, we have the producer Heather Pilder Olson and the director, Rick Walters with us. Good morning. Good morning. I was homeless for a couple of years, myself. I'm recovered heroin addict. I've done intravenous drugs and I've smoked other drugs. I have all of the addictive tendencies that some of the folks down here in Aberdeen have. And I'm at the point in my life where, you know finances being what they are. I'm like a stiff breeze from ending up back in a sticky situation like that. No, no, I live on the other side. Oh, your mom lives over here. Yeah. She moved over here while the whole like lawsuit and everything with the court case and the city was going on, they moved over here thinking like They're going to get swept. So they're going to beat, they're going to beat the sweep. Something like that? Right. Yeah. I guess. Where do you think all those folks are going to filter out to? I have no idea. We're all this is going to span out and I'm not sure yet. How do we find Adalley? I hate the sniffles. My allergies are awful. This my friend wrapped like herself for me and gave it to me as a gift. I don't know what kind of crystal just it's just a crystal I guess, but the wrappings on it little like leaves looking parts that are wrapped around it. by my friend are like woven together. Like helix's like DNA. Adalley what's the name of this camp? Oh, this has no name anymore. This is just abandoned now. I haven't really been like sick, like the flu or a cold or anything really, except for a couple of times. But I have had some other issues like infection and such like that. Like abscesses and stuff, which just sound kind of really gross to say so casually like this, I guess. But no, I've, I've gone to the ER, at least four times. I want to say since I've been out here and luckily my parents put me on a good medical plan and luckily the ER has my information for that saved. Cause I don't have my card to remember any of it but they remember it for me. I have a bike that has a 44 CC engine on it. Oh yeah. I call it my car because it has a basket in the back occasional people can fit in it. How's it been for you? Not too bad. Well, its a little shitty. I just moved out recently and there was, you know shit situation and ended up having to resort to this side. Couldn't find the place. All I heard was like, Oh, that's like the Rivertown moseyed around town, ask a couple people around. And they were just like, Oh yeah, it's right over here. So it was a little rough cause coming down and just like, you know, new face and everything just kinda like meeting people and was just like, Hey, like what's going on? Like what do I do? Like, do I set up a tent or do I just like claim a spot? Like how does this all go down? And pretty much they were just like, well it depends on whether or not people like you or not. Because if you're not a good face and you don't have a personality you steal rob and cheat fucking all day long then you're not welcome like it's a really tight community and people around here don't really fuck around like that. But yeah, first night was a little rough because just meeting people and talking to people no one wanted to really like share anything or, you know wanna fuck with me, a couple of people did know little bit further down I met some really nice people and they kind of started to introduce me to others. Well he had no choice. Insight too because I used to do that, that whole house. I planned on doing it anyways. Have you ever heard of who Shawn Vann is? I have heard the name, but I don't really know who he is. Sean was advocate for the homeless, but he was homeless. He lived on this river right here on this side of this river for 30 plus years. I'm telling you he died here a couple years ago. Like everyone looked up to him and everything like he was the fucking head of everything. He controlled everything down here and made sure that everyone was treated fairly out here. That's what really started out all this down here. Being family with him matter of fact his ashes are actually spread down here on this river. We used to have memorial sites down in the middle for him. But with his ashes being spread on this river and he's always had forever be a part of this river and that's what he would've wanted too. He looked at all of us, his own family as if we were blood. Treated us all like that too. To me. It's been my home away from home pretty much. 10, some odd years been here. Yeah. I'm a fire buff I like fire. I always played with matches. I never listened to my mother. Fourth grade was the best three years of my life. It seems like I like that. Lift it up so I can see it from the side. Where's a piece of wood. wheres a piece of wood here? Hey wood. That's me. I live in Northern Idaho. So your name is okay to be in the movie. Name is Benji Stevenson its all right to be in the movie. My names Dirty Dog Dean I drink gasoline a lot of gas I've been high since 1974. It really doesn't matter what I do. Got a good rope ill just hang myself. But anyway, I used to say that shit that's probably why I need treatments, right? I love you do your dance wheres your mama's at? Every single person down here. I consider family because I've been through so much down here with people that I will never ever go through anywhere else. You know, it's a tight knit community. We have a commonality, you know, on being down and out. And the things that, you know, we feel like everybody looks at us like we're just garbage. I became a homeless June of 2017 on December 1st of 2016 I came home from school and I found my mom's body. She had been there for about 12 hours and like, I couldn't I couldn't even sleep in my own bedroom after that day. Like for the last remainder, me being there I had to sleep on the couch. Cause I had, I couldn't walk down past my mom's bedroom doorway to get to my room every night. Like it was. It was fucked And then, um... and so it was, narrowed down to moving up to my dad's like, yeah, I love my dad by all means. And he's always been a great dad for me but he's still learning. And we were just bumping heads in areas that I just couldn't handle at the moment. And so with my search for self-reliance and responsibility and such that I've always kind of wanted to like, well I'm just independence in general. I moved out on my own and I've been out here since then trying to figure it all out and trying to find stability. I know the river it may not be the best place to find stability at but you work with what you got I guess. And that was where my situation has led me at the moment. So who knows? ...teach us your will... We always desire to have a relationship with you, lord we just ask that you make our path straight. So that may be possible bless the hands that prepared this meal Lord. We ask that you would always comfort us and guide us. Always, always love us never forget. Got ruined got wet out here that bummed us out this paper doesn't burn very good though. Its because it got wet. I know it's still. I need some plastic. I actually thought about hopping a train out of here. Huh? Well, we've got a dog now so we won't but we thought about it out hopping out of here Cause we want to do that as a bucket list. Ride a freight train cross states What's your youngest 19. No, no. - and you're 30? He's 17. Yeah. He's 17. Richard just turned 19. I'm a Richard Yeah, my first husband's name was Richard. So was my second. They both beat me I shouldn't have said that. Well, I shot my first husband. wait, what? Oh, I shot him with a 12 gauge he's cheating on me. And he used to beat me all the time. Hardcore. I mean, hold me up by my throat against the wall and just in my stomach and. shut the fuck up Oh no, no, he did not die. I shot him in the shoulder with a 12 gauge. He ran, we had a dog that had our puppies had puppies and they were just little guys, you know. They're just so cute. You know? And he turned around and ran them over. Ran a couple of them over, well, he ended up picking one up and he threw it at me and he hit me in my leg and that just, yeah, I pick him one up and it was just, it was still making noise it was really sad. it was real sad. Is there a lot of people down here who have mental health problems Um. everyone I've talked to or seen What kind of mental health problems They just seem like, I don't know. I don't know if they've done too much dope or or they really let things get to them. living homeless, you know not having the life that they dreamed of. So if, if I'm strung out on a 50 cent Jones and I come up from the river and I can't spell my name or read or communicate with people in a civil way, how, how do I get help? That's difficult. A lot of times you don't. I think there's always been an emergency with homeless people in our town but because of current politics people are just now kind of like opening their eyes and realizing we've been here since 46 doing the same thing that we're doing every day you know, and our numbers haven't gone down. They haven't, you know, it, it it's. So, no, I think it's, it's always, always been here but just people are now kind of waking up to it and, and realizing it. But I was one of those dumb kids that expected the world at right out of high school, you know and I'm the middle of six kids. You start drinking and you start, you know partying and just make some stupid stupid mistakes and you hurt people. And then, you know, then I got a little bit in trouble with the law and I was like, all right, here we go. Here's my life. Here's what we're going to do. And so I came here and I just, I finally, I just shut up and I just watched, I watched people, you know the people that were here and these people all they want to do with their lives was help people. That's it, that's all they wanted. And I was like, that floored me. I was like, you, I, I could do that. You know? And I, and I, I enjoy it. I always bounce them to make sure it gets the bugs off. Or at least some of the bugs I'm not normally really scared of bugs but like earwigs and fucking that one kind of that one kind of spider they have around here are creepy as fuck. I draw mostly I can do other things too. Like I can paint and such too, I can write, I like to sing but probably not right now because my voice is up. Plus I get stage fright. So, but if I don't feel like anyone's paying attention to me, that I'm good. But um- But I mostly draw and I don't really like using pencils. I usually use pen or marker because it helps me when I'm anxious, which I I kind of shut down into myself kind of a little bit and get kind of quiet and draw whenever I'm whenever it's getting a little bit worse and stuff. It helps me a lot with that because it's something else to focus on for a minute. But like sometimes if I don't have anything else I'll just draw on myself like on the arms and stuff or on my pants or whatever, I'll draw. If I'm allowed to I'll draw on people's walls and shit too. But that's only if they say it's okay Um... Just just on whatever I can. If, if I have the means to do so. like, if I have a pen or marker or something I'll find something to draw on Yea like, the lifestyle I came from I lived up on the Hill got my backyard in the city with a hot tub on my deck. And I went to a Christian private school with a uniform. Like I went from there to a small break period to this. Fucking bottom. So... Its not much but this is my home. It's more than what I got right now. I mean, I'm couch surfing in a tree house right now. Like if it wasn't for the homie, like I said I got a couple of homies that are still like, you know like riding with me and shit. Like he was the one that got me all this. Like he got me this tent, like you said, you know, you came you came from like a good fucking family. Like you had it all. Like, you know, like it was the same for me, you know? Like my mom's like, she she got locked up because she fucking, she was hustling. You know, she, she, she was big fucking time. So she got caught up. She fucking doing five years in prison and you know like we had, we had it all, you know, me and my brothers and like, you know, like even after she got locked up like I was doing pretty good for a couple of years and all like I was hustling and I was making good money. Like I was helping my brother and you know like whatever I wanted, I could buy, you know, like and like, I came from all that, to fucking, to this shit. You know what I mean? Even now, you know, like, I'm just trying to keep like the level head, you know, like just like the, like, like just right now, like I was I was chilling with the homie, you know, and like, you know and fucking and, you know, and he has to go to work and shit and. And like, just like the thought, like, you know when I know like, am I have to come back here and just like the thought of coming back here, like it's like this deep depression, like, it just hits me. I mean like such fuck, like, look look where the fuck I'm at. People say they feel lonely, but like they don't really like, get, like, they don't know what the fuck lonely is until, you know what I mean? Like all my family is gone. Like, like most of my brothers, like I had to send out like to Mexico and like, fucking, you know like my mom's just locked up. Like I ain't got no real family left out here. And yeah, like, you know that being lonely is like, it it's a it's a fucked up feeling, especially like out here, you know. Back in the day me and Kurt used to come under here and this was all sticker bushes this was the only way under here. But in here we used to go up t-chr-eh- Chris was up there, king of the hill, and we have come through here we come down here and we'd smoke weed, and worship Satan and uh- and worship Satan and uh- drink piss beer - you didn't worship no Satan. Yea, we called it c- Kurt called it drinking piss beer and worshipping Satan. One night we robbed an old Dad's liqour cabinet had gin. And we went to kurt, me and kurt- Took it to Kurt's house and mixed it with kool-aid and we got hammered Including previously unheard recordings. That's how I knew I was getting paid because I was working at Tacoma and it was like, '03 or '04. And they said, Oh, they're coming out with a box set. And the commercial, I was working graveyard at a lamination mill at the Port of Tacoma. And I'm like, listen to this commercial and and previously never heard uh show or uh recordings of their first or show ever in Raymond Washington. And I went, Whoa, I said that's me. That's me. And I went and I got really excited. You know anybody down at the river. Yeah. I know everybody's down there. Give the city should go in and just put some outhouses out and let the people live there. You know, that are going, like you said, in, in wham pull the bandaid off and bring in the troops or whatever national guard going there, move them screw them out. Boom. That's all you got you go into the sticks, your Batons I can't do it right March. And mow em you get them all out. What are you going to do? Don't just, don't play with them. This is only going to give you another 30 days. Fair. Its like let them stay. Let them stay and let people come in to help them. But you know, that's my in, in my fantasy world thats what... They're gonna basically get the bulldozers out and just bulldoze everything that they can just smash it all down to the ground like they did. But as far as I've heard that what they did last time I heard the rumor, they were going to sweep it. And I also heard that couple people that have been down here for a good three, four years that they do it every fucking year. Once a year, they come down and they try to like clean house. But right now there is an ongoing court case. And there's a few people down here that are representing said case. They actually show up to court and they plead their cases. outside the court house. We'll get there kinda early Parking is... uh. It's a shitty situation. We have parking lots on either side of the court one is like cash only one is cash or a visa. And I don't know if our card is a visa Yes its visa. Some of them are like quarters right? Yeah you can use cash or visa card. Levi Hunt 4th ward I'm a survivor of addiction. I lived here my entire life. I've lived on that river for many, many years out of the 14 people sitting up here right now in your nice dress clothes, paying your taxes. Like we should, you guys are you guys are a wake up away, or step out that door away from losing everything you have Maybe due to a fire, maybe due to um your boss doesn't like what you do. So you're fired now what? I buried 36 people, 38 people, since 2016 not of them are from active addiction. A lot of it's from mental health issues as well. We need to come together and figure it out as adults, instead of fucking Sorry. Instead of uh, uh. pushing people around bullying them because they're less than Misty. It's Levi. It's Levi. It's Levi. Are you coming with us? Sarah wants to know if you were coming. Okay. Yeah. Its all right. I see you'll be back down. This is, this is a lawsuit for you guys. Yep. For coming on a little road trip to Tacoma. We have to go right now. You need a cigarette. Can I have a cigarette? I'm gonna go through a metal detector here but you got valid ID. You are welcome to join us. We'll probably be lunch. Okay. Yeah. Sarah is going to be up there. April's going to be up there. We'll all be up there. A few people from down here will be up there. Probably free lunch... Oh, there is free lunch. Oh, there is free lunch. Where's mugs. He got it. He got accepted by CAP to get his own place. Oh, good. Okay. Good. Oh, fuck yea. You want to come along or you want to stay here. Okay. And we'll keep you updated and let you know how it goes. Yeah for sure do that. To stall them from sweeping the camp until they get serious about offering folks somewhere else to go. So Reverend Sarah is going to be there, April, Obai is going to be there but we will happily give folks there a ride and back. If anybody wants to come on a little road trip to Tacoma. I'm down. You down? Awesome. All right. You can come with us. Anyone else? When? Right now? Oh. I can't. Yeah, no, I can't. We have to-damnit. I wish it was like a little later tomorrow. I would but my car's been breaking into every time I leave. That's a priority. All right. We will report back and let everybody know how it goes. There's a lot of bullshit and drama that goes down on there. And a lot of stupid unnecessary crap. But honestly, we're all kind of like one big like extremely dysfunctional family. I mean, some of us don't like each other but when it really comes down to it if we really need something, we will help each other. Even if we screw each other over right the next day. It's kind of screwed up and kind of confusing but it's just the way it is down there. Like we screw each other over, but we got each other's backs at the same time saying that we're all just messy like drug addict, bums, who just live down there because we want to, or whatever, and just trash the place. That's kind of the big perception that a lot of the towns people have, especially the people up on Belair up on the Hill and the nice neighborhood and stuff. They forget that the view from the bridge isn't the only perspective that there is of the, of my home. And they forget that. Not everyone's the same. I love you. Everybody who showed up wearing a collar. If you could, maybe if you want to, when we go in seat yourself near the front, so that you're nice and visible, just so that, so that you're seen. It's important, I think, for the court to understand that this is a moral issue, as much as it's a legal issue this is about what's right and wrong. What we're at court for today, if you didn't get the message from the Bishop or anywhere else is we have requested a temporary restraining order against the city of Aberdeen, essentially to stall them from sweeping the largest encampment in the County. There's about a hundred people living there right now to stall them until there's an alternative place for people to go. Currently, there is not, not even kind of. The mayor has said that people are welcome to sleep in the sidewalks and public right away but there's several ordinances in town, criminalizing homeless people from doing just that. So that's not even an option. I'm going to start with a quick reading. Why doesn't God set a time for judging a day of justice, for those who serve him people move property lines to get more land. They steal sheep and put them in their own flocks. They take donkeys that belong to orphans and keep a widow's ox till she pays her debts. They prevent the poor from getting their rights and force the needy to run and hide. At night they sleep with nothing to cover them nothing to keep them from the cold they're drenched by the rain that falls on the mountains. And they huddled beside the rocks for shelter. Holy one of many names. We know that you're always closest to those. Who have no shelter over their heads, but heaven. So we're asking for your protection over our plaintiffs. We're asking for your protection over the people living in this encampment. We ask that you shield and defend them in the name of the one who creates redeems and sustains us all. Amen. And they said, well, why listen to them? They would say that, you know because they're there, they're just addicts. They're just liars. They're thieves, you know? And this one sided deal. Yeah, it is a lot of that down here. But then again, this is a, it's a whole other world across the other side from the tracks for the most part. Especially honored to acknowledge our former mayor, Steven Bucksbaum in the back of the room. Thank you for joining us Steven. One thing I can say after having been mayor for three years is I respect you even more each year as it goes by. And that you set a lot of the things in motion that are now coming to fruition. That's one thing that mayors you inherit the previous administration. And so you can't take all the credit for all the good things that happened because a lot of it was set in place before you and so how many of you have had a chance to see that KOMO show? I don't want to call it like a documentary. I don't want to give it that much credibility but it's called Seattle is Dying. You know? So it, it really struck a chord with a lot of people in this community who feel that they haven't had their concerns addressed. And it also, I believe painted a very bleak picture and a wide, broad brush of a problem. That's way more complex than what they presented. But what we're going to talk about today is the complexity of the homeless. There's no one pathway into homelessness and there's no one pathway out of it. So what I'm really proud to go around in our community and elsewhere is tell the story of what Olympia is doing. So how many of you have attended a city council meeting on a Tuesday night and given your three minutes of public comment? Wow, that's great. That's great. But what you're going to get today for those of you that haven't been downtown on a Tuesday night is you're going to get more than three minutes and you're going to get to be sitting around a table with people that you may not have ever met before. And that's what this is about is to share our experiences and learn together. So, you know, a year ago when I would walk this route every doorway would have, you know between one and four people, five people in it. Wow. On fifth. Yeah. And on fourth. Wow. And on Washington and Capitol and Franklin How were you able to stop that from happening? I don't see anybody out here no security guards or anything. How do you literally move people from a street once they're used to hanging out there? So it started with, you know, some businesses were okay. With it, some businesses weren't okay with it. Some businesses would be okay with it as long as people were up and at it by, you know, a reasonable time in the morning so that they could get their business open. Sometimes in the beginning, people would go out from the city and we'd have hot coffee and we would offer them, Hey, here's a cup of coffee. Here is a gift card for McDonald's to get a sandwich. Good morning. Riley is that you, how are you doing? Yeah. Time to kind of get up and get the day going. It is uh... about eight 30. Can you do that for me? Okay. I'll come back and check in a little bit. Okay. All right. Thank you. I was just being out here every morning letting people know Doing what you just did. Yep, exactly. And telling them, this is where you can go. This is, you know this business is not okay with you being in their alcove but here's a spot where you can be. What kid of repercussions did you get other than just, you know, people come and physically moving them. Others can take them to jail for sleeping there. And getting a ticket doesn't do anything. Nope. What's the real leverage you have if it's not the law. It's the relationship. So the site that we're going to eventually go to is the city sanctioned mitigation side is what we refer to it as. ...I think it might be in one of the packets It's a lot of information right there. It helps to explain what we are doing. So this is a great graphic to explain what an unmanaged site looks like the before and after pictures. And then the mitigation site, here's a site that obviously wasn't completely full at that time. But you can see where we were able to take one one of our downtown parking lots move people off temporarily come in re-stripe it. Move in the tents. It seems challenging for some folks to understand why there's even a need for a mitigation site. One of the Olympia city planners asked us before we left would you prefer these individuals? Some of which are strung out on drugs have extensive criminal backgrounds or mental health disorders, and some of which truly are in need and interested in help. Do you want them on your streets? Do you want them near your schools in your parks in front of your businesses downtown? My number one takeaway from Olympia is the amount of highly qualified and extremely passionate people who were troubleshooting this problem every day. The problem is judgment And not realizing that we're all one of same, you know? And that's the whole problem. If there's a lady on the city council said it perfectly if you change the way you see things the things you see will change its like the haves and the have-nots. And they see this distance which creates a conflict and a battle never going to be ended wars and conflicts until I see you as me. She sees me as her, you know, and then we'll come together. When the love is there, then everything will be fixed When the love is there. That's what it is. That's what's needed is a lack of love. And it's a lack of forgiveness. And that's a, it's like the rich people are judging the homeless people the dirty drug addicts the homeless people are judging the rich people You know? They're hoity toity the idea that you're not like me, and I'm not like you that's it that simple to literally be like You can get it that raw. this is my sister. You're my brother it doesn't matter who you are I've never met you before... So being as Mayor Larson is out. I will So the only thing I have to say is yesterday evening or yesterday day council member Rowe and I both attended the Tacoma federal hearing. So I'm going to have some clarification when we get to the actual meeting on that one. But it was an interesting process to go to federal court. That's for sure. It was back and forth between our attorney and the city attorney but the judge and the city attorney were kind of making the argument that folks down at the river they just want to stay there. They don't want to go anywhere else. And our attorney was like, where else will they go? Like, do you have like, Nope, there's nowhere else. The city has identified nowhere else for people to be the judge gave a lot of, it seemed like a lot of openings to the city attorney to just name a an alternative site, any alternative site, any park. And they wouldn't. So then the judge got mad and it was like, Um... and it was like, What'd he say? He said, you need to get an oar, and put it in the water and start working on this thing. He got very kind of like grumpy grandpa about it, the 3rd reading is an adoption of bill number 1905 prohibiting public access to river street properties for life safety public safety and public welfare reasons I moved to. Pass the 3rd reading. 2nd Its been moved and 2nded that we adopt the third reading is there any discussion? I would like to make an amendment to the 3rd reading Uh, amendment would Take the bill 1905 through the third reading and amend only as to the affected day. Is not sooner than June 5th, 2019 That would be the first Monday after the stay on the TRO he did grant the restraining order or the injunction as written, but he said, I'm putting a stay a 30 day, stay on this eviction. And within that time the city has to find a place for people. You need to talk to each other? So um, uh... So the ball's on the city's court at this point in terms of identifying a place. So that's what I heard. No, for the sake of discussion, please bear with me because I am more in favor of an option where we postpone the third reading, but direct staff to prepare to identify an alternative location for our consideration and you have that right to make that amendment. And that's what I, I'm not familiar enough. Robert's rules of order to know how to get that considered. So I'm going to take it as your word and the amendment you'd like to bring forward is that we, u table this and then direct staff- -Not table, postpone the 3rd reading. postponed the 3rd reading until when? Until June 12th. So you'd like to post on the third reading to the June 12 council meeting and direct staff to come up with an alternative location. Would anyone like to 2nd that amendment. Sure I will. It's been moved and seconded all in favor. Aye. All opposed Nay That amendment is failed. What else did other people hear? Well? Yeah. And he said he wanted them to negotiate. The, the two sides needed to negotiate something because he didn't want to see us back for the actual litigation that we filed. He wants something resolved out of court rather than in court, Back to the original amended ordinance Is there any discussion on that original amendment? All right, so it's good. Could you restate the amendment. So the, the amendment was to change the effective date to June 10, 2019 in respect of the which is the Monday after the stay of the temporary restraining order. All right. So this is a roll call vote roll call as amended Alstrom is absent Andrews. Yes. James Cook. Yes. Jeff Cook is absent Gordon is absent. Maki is absent. Prieto Yes. Rodgers. Yes. Rowe. Yes. Schave Yes. Shaw. Yes. Shortt. Yes. Madam Mayor Pro Tem that it has passed unanimously eight to zero. All right. DSHS statistics for December of 2017, was that there were a thousand people homeless in Aberdeen. So about five, roughly 500 people unsheltered and 500 people couch surfing. And that number is constantly revolving and changing all of the time. But that's a lot of people in a town of 16,000. But that's a lot of people in a town of 16,000. Um... That's a lot people to be unhoused. unhoused or very unstabley housed and not a lot of places for them to go. I'm James. I live in Aberdeen, B street. I don't know what ward that is I just want to say, man, one of the things that upsets me the most about our mayor or any of you is when you go to that river you want to just say these people, these river people that's the city of Aberdeen. That's your people. That's ward, whatever you want on here. That's Aberdeen. We just need to sit down and discuss some stuff. I don't care to go to court for anybody. I don't like dressing up, like I'm going to a funeral all the time, but it feels that way. Every time I walk in those doors with you all. I just want I've seen dreams and visions for this town. We should be living in skyscrapers by now. We're still trying to figure out crap out on the ground that's sad. That's pathetic. I mean, in the end, I think the conversation is. I mean the two things that I keep in mind is number one like people are people. Whether they're homeless or drug addicted or any of that, people are people and they deserve dignity and they deserve respect. And they deserve to be treated as people, no matter who they are and no matter what they're dealing with. And if we started the conversation there we would have a lot more productive conversations. But if we start the conversation with this idea that there are respectable people and trash people and trash people don't deserve anything. And we really would rather that they weren't they were either out of town or not alive. Because literally people have come to city council meetings and said that they just wish everyone would die. So, I mean So, I mean So, I mean it's really hard to have a conversation when we don't accept the basic dignity of every person. You know, we just have differences of opinion. We know nothing about each other at this point. There's, there's gotta be some way that each and every one of us has an ideal end goal here. Nobody wants those people to live like that. At the river, nobody hates anybody nobody wishes that they would all just like, Oh, go away. I didn't put them there. I don't want to leave them there because it's a danger. Not only to them at this point, it's it's inhumane to leave them living like that. - It's a danger to our city. You can't provide port-a-potties and accept that that's sanitary. But when we can't even have an interaction When these people are calling us out of Facebook live. Yeah it gets to be a little petty. I've never had a conversation with Ms Obai in real life we've and I don't even think we've had banter on Facebook because I've connected with Shelby. She lumps me in with this. I hate everybody group and she doesn't know how I feel we've never had a conversation. And that's my thing too, is that some people come out here and like, Oh, I feel so bad for them. We can't kick them out of the river but it's not because they care. They don't want them in their neighborhoods. That's the bottom line. There's Oh, there's a whole handful of people that are doing this whole like, Oh the poor homeless people at the river. They don't give a shit. You know? And I don't know what the end result goals is. There's gotta be a way to work together instead of constantly battling on Facebook for Christ sake and a mayor that doesn't even show up. On the count of three. One, two, three, freeze. So plum street village is our first effort in a tiny home approach to the elements of this crisis. It's a high level of management which you'll see when we got there that hand up to the community that holds community with our street outreach try to get them into a managed site. And then once they stabilize in the managed site and show that they can be successful with that level of oversight then they can interview to go into the plum street village. And that's one more level of case management. So right now we have 29 houses after this. We're also going through a tour. We're looking at housing anywhere between 40 and 45 residents here, we currently have one meal a day. That's provided from union gospel mission around five and five 30. And then also we have a local food bank that drops off donations here. And then residents can come here and bring food as they, like. We also have a resource center here. Full bathrooms, three of them. Washer and dryer on the backside smoking area. Of course, cigarettes only because there's no drugs and alcohol. and whatever barrier they come in here with. We do our best to try to make sure we can overcome that barrier. So when we looked for them for permanent supportive housing they can sustain that housing. Cause it's a different thing. We can always find housing but can they sustain that housing is the biggest thing. And we don't want them to fall back into the cycle. And so this is what the village is here for this is that pit stop for us to get them physically, mentally financially stable, to go back and be productive citizens in whatever County they live in. So this is the purpose of the village. We had a local hotel actually bring blankets here that they weren't using anymore. I mean, we've had mothers come here drop off food, Tide pods. And you know we've actually had the St Michael's people that go to their faith organizations come and drop off things. They actually built one of the houses here the blue house they actually built one of the houses here. The person who lives there they always want to meet every time I've heard, Oh can I meet the person in 19? Cause that's our house. Very true and it really took the community of Lacey and it really took the community of Lacey in Olympia coming together and really making this happen. And it's been great. We've been as an agency protecting citizens on riverfront for decades. And you know, I think sometimes we lose sight of that. I think the citizens may lose sight of that because of course what comes to the forefront is the criminal element. Not everybody on the riverfront are criminals. Not everybody on the river, front property are addicted to drugs or have mental health issues are, are alcoholics. Obviously there are those who have a combination of perhaps all three. I think there's a lot of positive interaction that is not really spoke of. I think you're going to get an opportunity when you speak with some of the officers that do frequent the riverfront property and you'll hear that same information Like this sleeping bag right here, you know like this thing saved my fucking life. I remember the first night I was out here like the very first night I had this tent and like I didn't even have a blanket. You know what I mean? And it was cold. It was like cold and windy. And like, it was my first time setting up a tent. So like my dumb ass didn't even put on like the tarp on. Right. You know what I mean? And like Fucking... so like it was a little bit exposed to wind coming in and I was in here like fucking freezing until like about two in the morning. And then fucking... I ended up having to, I was like, dude, I can't do this. I ended up having to, fuck I was like, dude, I can't do this. I got the, I seen this cop drive by and I got the idea, you know, like, you know as much as I fucking hate cops, you know, as much as they ruined my life, you know, like, like I was I was in a tight spot, you know what I mean? And I fucking looked up the police department non emergency number and I, I told them my situation and you know, they fucking hooked me up with this fucking blanket right here. They gave me like a little fucking care package and shit. And I was like, you know like I was like, you know, like, thank you guys. You know? Like I was appreciating like, you know, I don't I usually don't like cops, you know? But like they fucking they saved my life that night What's going on, man? How are you? I can't find my brother. Your brother? Chubby Chubbzzz Isn't he over on Wishkah? Yeah. I want to check on him though. All right. Cool. I'll go check on him too in a little bit. Yea thats all I want to do. Cool. I'll go check on him too in a little bit. Yea let me know. All right. take care. What's wrong with Chubbzzz? I know he, he's probably sitting down to throwing back, but. And that was his that was his way of saying I'm not doing nothing. I'm just trying to check on Chubbzzz here's chubbzzz right here. I'm looking for Ken Pinkernell. Has anyone seen, we're also looking for David gangle. If anyone had seen, how are you doing Ken? I just gotta check on these people. That's a good thing. Hey, Ken, take care of Homer. All right. Awe, cmon. I can't take care of both! I think Dave, I think Dave needs the most help though. I love you, brother Take care. He's always pretty cool. Always, always laughing, joking. Harbor Two Seven Six Two Seven Six, go ahead. I'll be down at the river camps checking on things 276, 1550 as this situation is getting worse and you realize, well, you know, work in these people go. They there isn't somewhere they can go. And there's no single answer. Everyone has a different story to tell. It's not like you can just say this is the way we're going to fix it. And so I'm just trying to do as much as I can to show them it's better for everybody. And it's certainly better for us in our careers. If they can fix their issues, they have and... become uh... uh... happier with their life and, and be in a better situation to where they want to get up in the morning. And they have goals like, hi, what's up out for a little jog going down to get some food getting some food, huh? Oh, it's down at the gate now. right. Oh its down at the gate now. You better get it before everyone else does. Yeah. All right. Good, good. You I'm glad you're looking good and everything. So, all right. You keeping them all in line down here. Oh, you bet. Trying. All right. All right. We'll go grab some of that food. All right. All right. Have a good day. And we just need to do the best we can to help them. They're the ones that decide. If they're going to make those decisions to get back on their feet, you can't arrest the problem. You know, you got to try to get them to take control of their life and try to get out of it. Someone ever help you carry that stuff. Once somebody did last week. Oh Dude, he is very, very, very capable. That man is one of the strongest men. I know. I know he is. I know he is. If you were to ask 30 years ago when I started in this profession and mission statements really weren't a thing. If you were doing choir, I would say, well it's the serve and protect, serve and protect. I think the protect thing is pretty evident that that's what we should be doing. I think the serve thing in some with some agencies has gotten a bit skewed as to what that translates into. What's like the ugly part of relating to folks down here? of relating to folks down here? Ugly... part? Some would say, they're like in the gutter they don't care about it. They don't care about what, what they look like. And we're looking like this is a sad thing and they don't want to change. And you're, they're, trying to like speak some sense into them. And it's it's hard to see that know they're hurting their life and they, they just don't really care about that. What do you tell- - Two PaulThirteen, go ahead. What do you tell Rick Walters when he falls off when he falls off and you find them down there at the river What do I tell Rick? Yeah. I'll go grab him and put him in my uh Chevy express van. And then I'll duct tape him to my tree at home. I'll tell him, honestly, I'll just be there for him. He's my friend. And I would probably go down and visit him and just talk hope into his life, you know because I shouldn't give up on him. That's, that's what it is. You know, I probably want to like punch him a few times but, you better not fall off. But if he does, I'll be there for him. I mean, that's what family that's what brothers do stick together. I got to admit there was some people I was uncomfortable talking to. I met this cat named Samuel and he scared the shit out of me. When I first saw him, I wasn't able to record what he said but I figured I'd tell you anyway because he's pretty much me. I've been on the streets and a lot of different States since I graduated high school. What else there is to say, but being with my friends being outside in nature, I get cabin fever sometimes. And I just want to travel. You got to take care of things and all that bull crap in life. I understand that. I don't even know what to say right now, man. I rather live in a tent in the forest and sleep around the birds and the bees than a than a house full of problems. I love the road. I love the river. I love hopping the trains the streets and all the different places I've been over the years and years. Right now I feel like I'm stagnant having to, Having to... I don't know, flip the page or turn the chapter on life. Sometimes almost all the time. I wish I could find like one solid girl around my age and just travel all over the country with her or something. See this beautiful world. But, that has yet to really happen. I don't know how much more I want to say other than that I don't know how much more I want to say other than that I don't know... I guess thank you for letting me speak. Put a smile on my face. Just... Just stopping and talking to me for a minute. You know the difference between a right hug and a left hug? When you hug someone this way your hearts beat apart. When you hug someone this way they beat together. Not everybody wants to be part of the system. Not everybody wants help but everybody's definitely somebody. I've known since we were little kids. He wasn't always like this. what was he like before? He was a normal bright young man very athletic And what happened? He got a hot dose. He got, a- Somebody shot him up with a hot dose Hot dose what do you mean? Its drug induced schizophrenia. Yeah. And I remember I was a teenager when the timber industry crashed and I remember loggers going door to door and I remember people becoming homeless and I remember all of that happening. And I remember people turning to drugs as an alternative not just as a coping skill but also as an alternative economy. Right. Right. It's an, it's a way to make money, you know? And you know, that's part of the problem. There's not a lot of ways to make money here. And when you're 18, 19 and end up on the street. Yeah. People like pissing and shit into fucking to bottles just to fucking cook with so like like fucking piss into a bottle and like pour under the fucking spoon just to cook with with like dude really you're gonna fucking put that in you. I'm like, man. That's why I only smoke like, That's why I only smoke like, I don't fuck with any-like I don't fucking slam nothing, like... I'll smoke it all. I'll smoke it all. Fucking put it on a foil, put it in the fucking glass pipe. Like I'm down with black. I'm down with white. I'm down with white. Fucking I'll do anything on the fucking face of the earth. I'll take tabs. I'll fucking, I'll do ecstasy. I'll fucking I'll shoot pills fucking all day. Do you have your lighter? Yes I do. Yeah. fucking heroin made me into the person that allowed my boyfriend at the time and a friend of his basically robbed my mom's house. Let them into my mom's house let them take whatever they wanted just so I can get my next fucking get well. Fuck... And realizing that and realizing the person I really am. And that wasn't it. Gave me the... the... confidence to fucking kick it. And I kicked the cold Turkey smoking chronic weed for two weeks. If I get beat up on throw me in that fucking fire. just make sure my mom gets my body don't just pit me in garbage can. I don't like that. I died three times in Seattle. That's how you communicate. Heroine and cocaine, shit. I've had a problem since I was 11 I don't even have anything against needles. Like I'm just like as sketchy, like dude fucking... I died a couple times. Its bad He can be within, you know a normal state of mind when he is sober but it takes a long time months, you know, when they get back and they still it's never the same, but yeah he's lucky to be alive. What is, where is he? Not sure. His mother, family, everything. Everybody has tried, but I don't I don't really know if it can be completely rectified. He lost a lot. When he went, he lost our brother Daniel and him were very best friends and he died right down there is his Memorial. And they both had the same thing. Drug induced schizophrenia. They were very close. And since then he's never really never really tried as hard. You know, he lost a lot when Daniel passed away. You know, he lost a lot when Daniel passed away. He lost is best friend. Yea. Thats why I asked twice You got bad hearing. Hi, my name is Tom Davis, I live in Aberdeen. Third ward. I'd like to share with you, what I consider maybe what sometimes people call it the wrong perception and a little reading here. Bear with me, please. A man once had to leave home for a long time. Before he left home, his wife got pregnant but he didn't know it. When he returned, his wife had given birth to a child. He suspected that little boy was not his and believed that he was the son of the neighbor that he used to come and work for the family, the little boy with suspicion. He looked at the little boy with suspicion. He hated him. He saw the neighbor's face in the little boy's face. And one day. The Man's brother came to visit for the first time when he saw the little boy he said to the father, he looks just like you. He's your exact duplicate. The brothers visit was a happy event because it helped the father get rid Get rid of his wrong perception. But the wrong perception had controlled the man's life for 12 years. It made the fathers suffer deeply. It made his wife suffer deeply. And of course the little boys suffered from that kind of hatred. We act on the basis of wrong perceptions all the time. We should not be sure of any perception we have. When you look at the beautiful sunset, you may be quite sure that you're seeing the sun as it is in that moment. but a scientist will tell you that that image of the sun that you see is an image of the sun from eight minutes ago sunlight takes eight minutes to reach the earth from such a long distance. Also, when you see a star, you think that the star is there but that star may have disappeared already. One, two or 10,000 years before we have to be very careful with our perceptions. Otherwise we will suffer. It is very helpful to write on a piece of paper. Are you sure and hang it up in your room and medical clinics, hospitals, they're beginning to hang up these kinds of signs, even if you are sure. Check again. It is a caution that if disease is not detected early it can be very difficult to heal. Medical doctors are not thinking in terms of mental formations. They are thinking in terms of a hidden disease but we can also make use of this slogan. Even if you are sure, check again we have made ourselves suffer. We made a hell for ourselves. And our beloved ones because of our perceptions. Are you sure of your perception? There are people who suffer from wrong perceptions for 10, 20 years. They are sure as the other person has betrayed them or hates them. And even though the other person has portrayed only good intentions a person who is the victim or wrong perception makes himself and the people around him suffered a lot. When you're angry and you're suffering, please go back and inspect very deeply, the content and the nature of your perception. If you're capable of rebuilding the wrong perception, peace happiness will be restored you and you will be able to, uh... love the other person again. Thank you, Madam Mayor. In Aberdeen, we're kinda in a unique postion, similar to Olympia. There's kind of the elephant in the room. The fact that the city is currently being in a lawsuit and a lot of that has stemmed from, I think, a disconnect between some of the people who were looking to advocate for homeless individuals in our community and the realities of what, what is attainable and also understanding that, you know, ultimately we're government agencies, we, we represent all people. We have to be thoughtful about how we're using the public's money how we manage public spaces for everybody's right. And so it's a very challenging thing because sometimes everybody has different expectations about what the city should do. And as far as they're concerned their expectation is the one that everybody supports. And you always find yourself in the situation of trying to find that common middle ground that you know is going to be sustainable. And then you make everybody mad. I think that's the biggest challenge is that homelessness is a continuum. You know, every program has a discreet population that it that it deals with and you're always going to have gaps. And I think, I think even when you talk about temporary housing, you know, it's really temporary for the individual and not temporary for the community in the sense that it's, it's it's always going to be a need the word temporary applies to the person that you're helping, not not the housing And it's, it's a very difficult thing. Cause people think, Oh, well, we'll do this. And then we'll, we'll get all of these people housed and then there'll be no more homelessness in the city. Good luck with that. The value of the home in general is so depreciated by the need for flood insurance that yes the banks won't lend in many of those homes reviewed do over 50% improvements. You're going to have to raise it up up five base flood elevation. Which more than doubles the cost of any of the models. It's a very delicate situation. We're working on addressing that. We've got a major levy project that's that's in the works that we've gotten significant state funding from working on the federal component to it. And that should take about 3,300 properties out of the flood plan. And it represents about half of the city's real estate. When we build this levy and we and we have all of this growth and we've got to manage all of this. We aren't going to see any increases in funding to do that. So that's, that's the other challenge. So it's, it's, it's, it's always complicated, isn't it? Yes. And like I said, we're all in this together. Really. Hello? Hey, what's what's going on, Barb. Hi. How are you doing Who is this? Dean oh its that long lost idiot son. How are you doing. Oh, I'm doing all right. I'm down on the river. How are you guys doing? Do you still have you apartment there in Aberdeen. Oh, no, no, no, I don't got that either but I am going to treatment there within two weeks. You're going to treatment. Yeah, I got a bed date. I haven't told anybody. You're the first one, so, yeah. So you're camping out too. Hey, I love camping. I should've did this a long time ago. Who needs a truck and shit When I can just live down at the river. What's father doing. sitting at the table he can't hear on this phone. Well, just tell him to say hi to me anyway. Just say, Hey. Oh, Hey, you dumb son. Anything. I met him right here for my first time. Hello? Hey, what are you doing. I can't hear Hey, what are you doing Pops. anyway. Anyway. It's all right. I want to hear his voice. There you go. Can you say anything you want brother. You know, my brother and my friends. What keeps you happy? What keeps me happy? I mean, fucking... society, I guess, fuck. Knowing that there's a fucking possibility of going back. I mean, like this isn't forever, I guess. Like, I don't want to do this. The rest of my life. It's a fucking stepping stone. What, what keeps you happy? I don't know. My son has been teaching me. I don't know the Bible, but even kind of working, you know teaching me the word about God and everything. It keeps my hopes up The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want and makes him lay down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake though, I walked Though I walk through the Valley of shadow and death I shall fear no evil. For his rod, his staff they shall comfort me. He prepares a table before me. He annoys my head with oil. My cup runs way over. I don't want anymore. Surely goodness and mercy will follow the rest of my days in life. And I shall dwell in the house forever in Jesus' Holy name. Amen. And that's Psalm 23. I learned that in jail. and it seems to work sometimes and keep a positive attitude. How do you stay happy? Um... I just go on with my day, do what I, whatever I gotta do. Get my things taken care of that daily like water and getting fed and everything and make sure that dried clean clothes and stuff. It just became a habit, something normal. You know, and you can't help everybody, you know but I can make sure everybody's got coffee. Everybody's got food in their bellies. You know, there's, you know, there's some people that are just so far gone that You really... you try to just make sure that that they're safe at night and that they I've got some, you know they go home or go outside with food in their bellies but that's about all you can do for them. And it it's sad and it's depressing, but you know but, you know we're here every day trying to just make sure that everybody's at least taking care of a little bit and there's no easy or neat solution to it. There's a lot of different cities that are doing a lot of different things, but really, I mean, it's it's not going to be not gonna be easy to fix the homeless problem if you could even fix it. So. But, you know, everybody's got to eat. And there was also what always happens when there's lack is there's always there's always the temptation to fight each other. Do you have any, is it like contested like your relationship with the city or the police department? Or are you guys working together? Well, it's always contested particularly, you know now we're in the middle of I'm, I'm in the middle of litigation with the city, so it's contested but is there anyone that you, I mean do you guys talk sensibly, like when you have phone calls or like in other situations, like, I mean I've had many one-on-one conversations and also group conversations with both the mayor and city officials on numerous occasions. And I'm always open to continuing that. Um... What I would like to see is those conversations move toward you know, actual solutions. You know, I I'm cognizant of the fact that right now there's a large number of people homeless in this area that are trying to find a place to go. And no matter where they go, they, they there there's somebody that doesn't want them there. I get that. And that's something that we're struggling with and we're trying to find solutions. I very much appreciate what people come together and say I understand, I understand both sides of this issue. How do we go from the divisiveness that we're at now and find to find a solution that that might not be everything everybody was looking for but it's better than what we have today. And, you know, that's something that I still am hopeful we'll be able to get to. But a lot of the comments there tonight were not comments that were coming from a place of trying to reach that point. And so, you know, it's something that is frustrating for me but you know, we're we're just going to keep moving forward. on trying to address this issue, like many other areas in this state and this country are trying to do. I think we have the opportunity as a community. We, we either can choose healing. We can choose to invest in solutions or we can self-destruct um... and tear each other apart. um... And I hope we choose healing. I hope we choose solutions. I'm gonna say right now, you don't know me and shit. and I'm... I don't know, probably sound weird. I don't know, fuck. but um... I'm in a similar situation, I guess, but Right. But, um... if you ever need anything and you see me around or anything like holler at me, I do appreciate that. You too. Like, I mean, even somebody to talk to you, you know? And just like I tell people, you know I don't got much, but like, you know like I know how I know what it is, like how it's like when you like feeling like, you know, like, like you wanna you just want to give up, you know? And like, you got nobody to talk to you. You know what I mean? Yea. I'm going to come up. You know what I mean? I still got faith. Good don't let go of that. But you know exactly like, cause if you don't have that then what the fuck do we have? Exactly. Every day- - No matter how hard and fucking fucked up it is at least you have something to learn from it. The only way you can really look at things and keep moving forward. Uh, what's your name, sir? Uh, David. David, okay David. Do you have anyone we can contact for you, David? Get some assistance to help you get moved? Because we have some tent sites set up by city hall... Long as I'm warm middle of the night till I wake up. Ill sleep nice and warm. and that's all I need. The rest... It's love. I'm surrounded by love. Heya, Heya, Heya, That's sort of my old sayings. Actually its a-Actually its a song. Heya, Heya, Heya, can I sing it? Yeah. All right.
