We're here! Look at them all! Whoa! [chuckles] Mummy, Mummy, can I please have one of these? Please? - [kid 1] Aw, baby bilbies! - [purring] Can I take one home? Take my picture! Take my picture! - Oh my gosh! It's Pretty Boy! - [kids screaming excitedly] - [kid 2] Yay! Pretty Boy! - [all cheering] [kids] Aw. - [screams] - [cameras clicking] Okay, folks, just give the little fella some air, would ya? He's a bit tuckered out. But his webcam is on 24-7, so you can see him anytime on the Pretty Boy app. - [kids] Yay! - [whimpering] [kid 3] We love you! - [kids] Bye! - [kid 4] Bye, Pretty Boy! [sighs] I wanna go see the ugly animals. Dolores, you come back here! Those creatures are dangerous. I'm not afraid of some stupid, smelly, ugly... [gasps] [dramatic music playing] [hissing] [snarling] [growling] - [water flowing] - [gasps] [roaring] [screaming] [indistinct chatter on monitor] [crocodile growling] [chittering] What's going on? - Did Jackie scare another kid? - [buzzing] [munches, gulps] Yep. [growling] [laughing] She's such a ham. The show hasn't even started yet. - She didn't bite anyone, did she? - Nah. Just gave some whiny kid a bit of a scare. Probably the first time she's seen a croc close-up. Wait till they get a peep at Maddie. [laughs] - [horn blaring] - Showtime, guys. Do they have to blast that horn? Why can't they play panpipes? You're a deadly scorpion, Nigel. Forget the panpipes. [sighs] I hate showtime. Should we wake Maddie and tell her what it's like out there? Nah. Let the poor thing sleep. She'll know soon enough. [door opens] - Aw, not the pincers! - Ugh! Could they at least warm 'em up? Righto, guys, grab some glass. - Mmm. - [Nigel sighs] Oh, stop. Please! I'm ticklish. Please stop! Hey, hey, hey! Watch the spikes! That's soft tissue! Good luck, Maddie. [ominous music playing] [switch clicks] G'day, gorgeous. [slithering] [hissing] Hi, Chaz. How's my special girl? Ready to get out there and meet your public? Yes. [chuckles] And I know you can't understand me, but I'm gonna make you so proud out there. You call that a smile? Come on, where are those fabulous fangs? [hissing] Maddie, those people are gonna go nuts when they see you. So let's get out there and show the world how beautiful you are. [giggles] - [crowd cheering] - They're horrible. They're disgusting. They're the deadliest creatures on the planet. But have no fear. 'Cause they're guarded by the toughest and bravest hero in the whole world. He puts the Aussie in awesome. The wonder from Down Under. He's my dad, Chaz Hunt. [crowd cheering] [rock music playing] [whistling] - [purring] - [gasps] Thanks, Chazzie. I don't know about being a hero, folks, but the ol' chip off the block's right about one thing. These animals are deadly. Step back, son. Step back. ‘Cause it's time to meet Jackie, the saltwater crocodile. [growling] This beast from the billabong could swallow you whole. But not on my watch! [scattered screams] [snarling] Come and get me, you ugly monster! - [Chaz] Come on. Easy! - [gasps] Papa! - [Chaz] I'll take her from here, son. - [growling] [grunting] Easy. Whew! Crikey! That was tougher than tackling a Tasmanian tiger off a tucker box. It's not just the big critters you gotta look out for. - Chazzie, bring out the creepy crawlies. - Here ya go, Dad! In this box is one of Australia's deadliest creatures. - And he's no bigger than my hand. - [crowd gasps] Sting, sting. Ouch, ouch. Grr. Grr. Not scary enough? How'd you like to hold this hairy little beauty, a venomous funnel web spider! [growls] [Chaz] He's extra toey right now because it's funnel web spider mating season, and he's the only one in captivity. I can't believe he just told them that. You have been a bit tense lately, Frank. Hang about! What's this disgusting thing under my hat? Ugh! Your face? [Chaz] A thorny devil lizard! Ew. But by far, the deadliest creature on this planet is the taipan snake. There is no creature more deadly, more venomous. Now stand back, folks. I trained her myself the moment she came out of the egg. Please let them love me. Oh no, set the bar lower, Maddie. Like. Please like me. Liking would be fine, and like could become love, and like would be terrific. [chuckles] - Break a leg, Maddie! - She doesn't have any legs. She can borrow one of mine. - [Chaz] So prepare to meet... - [crowd gasps] - ...Medusa! - [crowd cheering] [cameras clicking] Oh, the sun! [gasps] Oh my gosh. Thank you. Ah! It's so amazing finally meeting you all. Um, I... I've never even seen the sun before. [chuckles] Now show 'em that beautiful smile. - [hissing] - [crowd gasps] Well, didn't I warn you, folks? She is a cold-blooded killer! Wait, what? - [crowd screaming] - [Chaz] Look at those hideous fangs! "Hideous"? But you... you said... Hear that horrible hiss? That means she's about to attack! - Look at her! - [hissing] [crowd screams] Just one drop from this snake's venom can kill 100 people in less than ten seconds. - [crying] - [hissing] Get that monster away from my son! "Monster"? Righto! Back in your box! - Get in there, you ugly monster! - [Chaz chuckles] Good one, son! But I'm not a monster, am I? [crowd cheering] [Chaz over PA] The park is now closing, folks, but don't forget to tune in to the Pretty Boy app to watch everyone's favorite koala go to bed. Night night, little guy. Sleep tight. ["Zou Bisou Bisou" by Gillian Hills playing] [yawning] Bonne nuit, Pretty Boy. [blows kiss] - [grunts] - [crowd roaring] - Aw. [groans] - [bell dings] [man] This is Mission Control patching you through to Pretty Boy now. Aw. ["Zou Bisou Bisou" continues playing] [song ends] [groaning] Ow! - [Nigel gasps] Oh! - [groans] [grunts] [door closes] - Are you okay, Maddie? - [door opens] Get down, you crazy croc. [snarling] - [blows raspberry, screams] - [laughing] Be careful, Jackie. They don't know you're kidding. Ah! They love it! Besides, keeps me young. And how are my babies tonight? Maddie! I almost forgot. Today was your first show. How'd it go? Aw. That bad, huh? Oh, honey. Look at me. Come on. Show Auntie Jackie that beautiful face. [sniffling] I'm not beautiful. I'm a monster. [laughs] Because a few humans screamed? They were terrified, Jackie. I... I made them cry. So? Have some fun with it. I do. That's not who we really are. Frank, who are you? Australian funnel web, Hadronyche cerberea. [laughs] Not the label on your cage, love. In your heart. What's your true passion? [sighs] Interpretive dance. [laughing] What? Why is that so funny, Zoe? I thought you needed a partner to be a dancer. Don't be mean! It's not Frank's fault that it's mating season, and he can't get a date. Oh my God. Please, can everybody just stop talking about that? I'm single by choice! By choice, people! And Nigel... Nigel just wants everything to be beautiful. I have a horror of beige. [Jackie] And Zoe's so smart, she's always figuring out clever ways to escape. And as for you, you can... - Kill 100 people in ten seconds! - [Zoe] Seriously? Uh, I was just complimenting her ruthless efficiency. Not helping, Frank. You can be whoever you want. So who cares what a bunch of silly humans think? But... but Chaz said that they'd love me. He said I was special. And you are special. No, not in that way, not like him. ["Tous les visages de l'amour (She)" by Charles Aznavour playing] [cooing] - Ugh. Gross. - I hate him. I'd love a snuggle. Uh, I mean, boo. People love him. They line up for hours just to hug him. No one's ever gonna wanna hug me. Unless you threaten them with your insatiable bloodlust. - Frank! - It's just a pitch. Aw. You know what you need? - A nice bedtime story to cheer you up. - Yay! Now you kids were brought here when you were just babies, so you wouldn't remember anything about the outback. Oh, I do, I do. I mean, not much but, uh, just a song my mum used to sing. - Why don't you sing it to us now? - And maybe Frank can dance! [kissing] Uh, maybe Frank needs help. It... it... it's a twig. I know that. But try telling my heart. [Maddie] ♪ Sleep, little one ♪ ♪ Close your eyes ♪ ♪ Your body's cooling with the night ♪ ♪ Let your worries slip away ♪ ♪ Tomorrow is a brand-new day ♪ - [all] Aw. - [Jackie] Aw, that's beautiful, hon. Your mum must've loved you very much. [sighs] I wish I'd known her. Well, can't say I ever met her, but before I came here, I visited a lot of places in the outback. - What was your favorite place? - [Jackie] Oh boy, that's a tough one. - She tells us every night, Nigel. - Shh. I think my favorite place is the mountains where I grew up. - I knew it! I knew she was gonna say that. - She says it every night! [Jackie] They're the most beautiful mountains in the world. Tall as the sky! - [Nigel gasps] What color? - [Jackie] Red as a bushberry. Except at sunset, when they turn the true color of the outback. - [Nigel] Burnt sienna. - [Jackie] That's right. And that's the place where all of you come from. And I know that one day you're gonna find your way back to those mountains and meet your families. Now go to sleep, my babies. [yawning] [Jackie] First show's always the hardest, hon. It gets easier. I promise. [seagulls cawing] [Chazzie] Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

[all gasp] [screams, grunts] Don't worry, love. Your dad's on his way. Ahh! [yelling] Ahh! [siren wailing] What's happening? Why are there sirens? I hate sirens. - Maybe the park's on fire. - [gasps] Maybe Pretty Boy died. Nah. I've seen the plans for his funeral. There's a choir. It's Jackie. They thought she was attacking Chaz's son, but she was just trying to help. [Chaz] Put a muzzle on her! Get her out of here! - [grunting] - Down! Down! - Leave her alone! - [banging on glass] [grunts] She didn't do anything! She was just trying to help! Jackie! - Maddie. - I've gotta get outta here. [pants] - Let me out! - Maddie! [panting] [breathes deeply] I'll take a closer look, okay? [dings] [thunder rumbling] [somber music playing] Oh, Jackie. [door closes] [engine starts] [music continues] [thunder rumbling] [sniffling] [softly] No. [lights shutting down] [panting] - [sniffles, whimpers] - [footsteps approaching] [gasps] It wasn't my fault, Dad! Honest! I was just trying to be like you. Hey. I'm not mad at you, Chazzie. You're... you're not? It's never easy seeing an animal get taken away like that. Look, that croc had it coming. I mean, these creatures are killers, son. Never forget it. I was so proud of you out there. Not every kid can stare down the gullet of a two-ton killing machine and come away with dry daks. That takes guts. Thanks, Dad. Now, how about a bedtime story? Where were we? Chapter four. [clears throat] "How I Fought a Giant Python and Lost Your Mother." "The swamp was steamy with the stench of death as we began our honeymoon." "I paddled the canoe upstream..." [somber music playing] Who's gonna tell us stories now? [Frank] Um, Maddie? Tell us about the mountains. [somber music continues] [Maddie] No. Why not? Because I'm done just talking about them. I say we go out and see them for ourselves. - [all] What? - Break out of here tonight. - [whimpers] - Are you nuts? Those mountains are in the outback! That's 500... 500... 1,500... nine miles away. No, no, no. I can't leave my glass box. The glass box is me. - I'm the box. [hyperventilating] - [Frank] Breathe, Nigel. Breathe. [sighs] Well, we're down to three. Guys, listen to me. I know it's scary, but do you want to end up like Jackie? Spend your whole lives being put on display like freaks? Because that's what we are in here. Monsters. But out there, we're someone's kid, someone's brother, sister... family. [inspirational music playing] - Out there, we can be... - Dancers? Ourselves. Zoe, climb out and unlock our cases. Tonight, we're going back to the outback.

Can't hear you over all this noise! They'll see us! Please! We're just trying to get to the outback so we can find our families. [gasps] Oh. Wow! That is so inspiring. Families are very important to me too. [laughs] You're a snake! You're not gonna get five yards. And anyway, what kind of family is gonna want a bunch of ugly bugs like you?

[all] Yay! - Um, uh, I think that's the city. - [opera music playing] - [sighs] - Sorry, yeah, that makes more sense. [chuckles] It felt too easy, right? But we're on our way. And somewhere beyond those lights is the outback. I hate to break it to you, but there's a lot of water between us and those lights. And none of us know how to swim, so how are we gonna... - What's wrong with Frank? - [Frank grunting] - Frank, what are you doing? - I dunno. [spluttering] It's like now that we're in the wild, some kind of instinct's taken over. [gasps] You mean... Oh! Oh! I think it's a mating dance. [grunting] [disco music playing] Okay, if he's gonna do that the whole way, I'm taking the bus. There's a bus? - Guys, focus. - [Frank blabbering] We need to find a way across the harbor. - Oh! Does anyone know a friendly turtle? - Or we could find a raft. That's exactly what I was gonna say. What's a raft? - Anything made of wood. - [snoring] What do we do with Satan's teddy bear? [Maddie] Ugh, we have to take him with us, or he'll sound the alarm again. We can let him go when we get to the city. I want my snuggly. Mmm. Ugh! He's so furry and hot. Come on. [ship horn blowing] Do you think you could've found a raft that wasn't full of holes? You said "made of wood." Guys, guys, don't argue. Look at us. We're on our way. [chuckles] And check out the sky. I've never seen the sky at night before. - [Nigel] What are all those twinkly dots? - I think they're called dandruff. - "Dandruff"? - Yeah. You know that stuff that comes off humans when they scratch their hair? It floats up into the sky, and it shines at night. [Maddie and Nigel] Wow. Dandruff. Oh, look, what a pretty little sailing boat! That's not a boat, Nigel. That's a... [all] Shark! Paddle! Paddle! It's circling us. [Zoe] Paddle in circles! - [all] Ahh! - [grunting] What? What's going on? Why is my bottom wet? Are we getting colonics? Just grab a leaf and paddle! You koalanapped me, you psycho worm! You snitched on us, you dirty little bear! - Just you wait till... - Bigger problems! - [roaring] - [all] Ahh! [coughing] Oh, sorry to scare you. I get that reaction a lot. It's the smile, isn't it? You know, I took some acting classes, did a few mime workshops. But it's just not me, you know? So I thought, "Hey, stop trying to change who you are." "Just be yourself, the face of death, aka Jacinta." - [mollusks] Hi! - Ahh! [grunts] Hey! Aren't you that snake who can kill 100 people in ten seconds? Oh. No, not really. It's... it's more like 94, 95 tops. But you've probably eaten a lot more people than that, right? Sorry. I don't know why I said that. That was so inappropriate. Nah, sounds about right. Did you guys just escape from the park? Yeah! How'd you know? We get a lot of breakouts. Last month, it was a dung beetle. Duncan? I thought he got released back into the wild. The only place he got released was into the belly of a seagull. - [seagull cawing] - Tragic. The one night I was off sick. Ugh! Could you be any more self-obsessed? Can everyone please focus on me for once? Razor face, take me back to the park, or I'll have your fins made into soup. - "Razor face"? - No, he didn't mean that. And we're not going back to the park. We're on our way to the outback. Then you've come to the right place. For I am... [whispers]...a secret agent. Lethal and deadly. - Designed to strike with stealth and... - [all] Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

That's when the really scary creatures come out. - What are they? - [mollusks] Humans! [man on radio] We need an urgent dispatch, 59372 at the Australian Wildlife Park... Stone the crows, what's happened here? [shoe squeaks] They've gone, sir. And look what they've done to Pretty Boy. [gasps] Crikey! [gasps] What are you gonna do, Dad? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, son. I'm gonna go out there and call Pest Control. Pest Control? - Aren't you gonna hunt 'em down yourself? - Eh? You know, like how you hunted those wolves who ate those orphans? Oh! Right. Yeah, yeah. But well, they ate orphans, you know, so... You said that snake was the deadliest creature on the planet. They're a menace to society, Dad, and you're the only one who can stop 'em. - [stomping feet] - Please? [inspirational music playing] [sighs] Pack your peashooter and some clean undies, son. [Chazzie, guards] Yay! We got some deadly creatures to hunt. Once you're through the city, head for the Blue Mountains. - They sound pretty. What kind of blue? - Uh, kind of a smoky eucalyptus blue. [Nigel] Like a cerulean or... They're mountains, Nigel. I'm sure we'll find them. Thanks, Jacinta! And remember, if you need help, contact... [mollusks] U.S.S. - Aw, what a sweetheart. - [tires screeching] - [horns blaring] - [man] Hey, watch where you're going! - [Zoe] A lot of humans. - [Nigel] Maybe some of them are nice. - They're gonna kill us. - Right. Forgot that. Let's move on. And I'd love to stay, but I'm afraid I'm late for my appointment with the real world. Hey, watch it! By the way, you're never gonna get to the outback. You should quit now before you get your friends killed. [laughs] - Later, losers! - [scoffs] What a jerk! Oh, but look at his cute little bottom. Like it was knitted by angels.

They're getting away! Get up! [panting] I can't. I need a rest. I'm parched. Where's the FIJI Water? We drank it all, but here. [slurping, gulping] - What is it? - My urine. [Chaz spitting] I got the idea from that time you were tracking those lions. - What? - You went ten days without food or water. And you had to lie in manure so the lions couldn't smell you. Hey, maybe we should do that. Maybe... - I never tracked a lion! - [gasps] Or rhinos. Or wolves. Or even a package online! But you grew up in the outback. No, Chazzie. [clears throat] I grew up above my auntie's lingerie store... [in American accent]...in Tampa, Florida. But what happened to your voice? This is my voice. My real voice. Okay? You see, son, when I was a kid, I got picked on a lot by other kids. [indistinct chatter on TV] And then one day, I saw this Australian guy on TV wrestling a crocodile. And he sounded so cool, you know? [Australian hero on TV] Holy smokes! Danger, danger, danger! [Chaz] So I started talking like him, and suddenly, I wasn't nerdy Charlie Huntington anymore. I was... [in Australian accent] Chaz Hunt, you know? Outback legend. People respected me. I grew a mustache. I moved out here and made up all that other stuff. So then Mum... Wasn't swallowed by a giant python. She ran off with a landscape architect called Bret. And all that stuff you say in your show about how bad these animals are? Did you just make all that up too? No, no, no, no. I meant every word of it. These creatures are evil, and I'm glad we're hunting them. I realize that now but... This is my chance to make up for all the lies, to be the hero you deserve. And I'm not gonna let you down again, son! We're gonna finish what we started, no matter how hard it gets. We'll face danger. We'll face death. We'll drink each other's urine. I dunno, Dad. Maybe we should just go home and play some video games. I'll raise an army if I have to! But I'm gonna catch those freaks and show the world who I really am, a rugged, semi-Australian man! Maybe you should put some pants on first.

[grunts] - [gasps] [grunts, growls] [grunts] - Oh, I have to get the key off Chaz. - Maddie, wait! We're sorry. - [Maddie] For what? - Taking you away from your family. Guys, you didn't take me away from my family. You brought me back to them. You're my family. - All of you. - All of us what? What did I miss? - I love you guys. - Aw, that's sweet. [tires screeching] And I'm never leaving you again. [both screaming] She left us again. - [both] Oh! - [grunting] Ugh. Some rescue! Okay, stand back. I'm busting us out. We can't.

[all] Ahh! [Chaz] Closer. Closer. Gotcha. - [croaking] - Huh? G'day, mate. Nice day for it. [hisses] - [gasps] - Red frills, scorpions, attack formation! Ooh! Ahh! [bikers grunting] - Look! - It's them. They made it. [hissing] [chittering] You came. That's what families do, love, help each other out. Hasn't anyone told you that? Besides, beats lying on a rock all day. [laughs] Oh no! It's Skylar. What are they doing here? "...branch will break." And she's like, "At least I don't have nits," and I'm like, "As if!" And then... Wait. This is so not Keisha's birthday party. Anyway... Seriously. I feel sorry for her. She used to be nice, and then we became friends, except... This is gross! I was more like a fashion consultant. Charge! Onwards and upwards! - [squeaking] - Ahh! - Ahh! - Ahh! - [grunting] - [screams] - [growls] - [yelps] [grunting] - [heroic music playing] - [laughing] [giggling] [kissing] Oh, now that's a dancer!

If it wasn't for that treacherous cliff... - [all gasp] - [rumbling] The brakes! [shuddering] - [grunts] - [all squealing] [tires screech] - So unfit. - PB! [panting] I have a newfound respect for hamsters! - You gotta get off! - I can't! - Jump! - I can't. - [Maddie] Jump! - [yelps, grunts] Whoo! Gotcha! [dramatic music playing] [thudding] [tires screeching] [music warping on stereo] [music stops] - Chazzie! You're safe. - [rumbling] [all screaming] [clattering] [dramatic music playing] Chazzie? Uh... Daddy! Hang on, son. I'm coming. [gasps] [all gasp] Okay. Just... just... [whimpering] Quick! Wedge something underneath. [thrilling music playing] [gasps, grunts] Ow. [kissing] Stella! Ahh! [grunts] Don't hurt my son, you monster! - I am the deadliest snake on the planet. - [whimpers] One drop of my venom can kill 100 men.

[grunting] - [gasps] - [Chaz grunting] [continues grunting] - Ahh! - [Chazzie grunts] [thudding] [sobbing] I'm so sorry, son. I thought I'd lost you! It's okay, Dad. We'll be all right. [sentimental music playing] We did it, M. We saved him. Whoo-hoo! Did you just lose some weight? M? M! Ahh! She's empty! My friend's a husk! She's melted from the inside! [Maddie] PB, that's just my old skin! I'm over here! [Pretty Boy] Whoa! Yeah. She does that all the time. Yeah, it's kinda gross if you ask me. Maddie, you're beautiful. [chuckling] Thanks, PB. She's always been beautiful. You just never noticed before. [Chaz sobbing] [all grunt] - Jeez. - You're spiking his eye. - I'm in his ear. - [Pretty Boy] You're kinda choking me now. Oops, I think I bit him. Phew. - There we go. - Well, that was awkward. - [sobbing, blowing nose] - Ugh. - Sorry. - That's okay. It's been that kind of week. [sniffling] [gentle music playing] Thank you. You're welcome. What do we do now? Go home, of course. - Where's that? - [loud cheering] Why don't we ask them? [cheering continues] [uplifting music playing] [blowing kiss] What happened to Twiggy? I don't know. She just snapped. [music continues] [croaking] Blech. [chittering] - Ugh. - Look! It's Doug and Doreen! Hey there! You made it! Well-done. [whistles] [baby toads] Yay! - Who are they? - [Doreen] These are our kids. Since Tuesday? Well, you know Doug. This is Braden, Haden, Jaden... Oh, they're so adorable! Huh? What? Ew! No! Not on me! ...Terry, Tiffany, Tammy, Chevy, Dwayne... Oh, Doug! The head of the Uglies Secret Society wants to congratulate you in person. - The head? - Of course! Who do you think told all those agents to keep an eye on you? [chuckling] Hello, my babies. [all] Jackie! [laughing] But we saw you get taken away. Oh, please! I'm the head of an international rescue team. And I picked up a few clever ways to escape from this one. So you've been watching over us the whole time? Well, that's what mothers do, love. - [baby toads croaking] - Ugh! This toad spit can't be good for my fur. Unless it is. Is toad spit good for my fur? Has anyone seen the research on this? Now let's go home. [uplifting music playing] Ahh! Get away! Argh!
