We celebrate Women's Day once a year. And then we forget about it. Is one day enough to honour all the women? If women are honoured every day, then there's no need to celebrate Women's Day once a year. Because celebrating Women's Day for one day won't change anything. And neither will they develop. From today, if every person vows to honour and protect women, then very soon, women all over the country, all over the world, will feel safe, and they will get their rights. They will feel safe, and they will get their rights! They will feel safe, and they will get their rights! They will feel safe, and they will get their rights! Asha! - Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Mr Dubey is here. Hey... - Greetings, ma'am. Greetings, Mr Dubey. Please come. - Yes. Ma'am, I had to come as it was a bit urgent. I want to meet Rohan. Rohan isn't here. Didn't you meet him in the office? Well, ma'am, I was at the site the entire day. You know the Bhayandar project? - Yes. I have been given its responsibility now. Wow! How is it going? It's going well. Well, the foundation isn't very strong. A 17-floor building on sandy soil! Think about it. Please talk to Rohan about this. I'll talk to him, but he hasn't come home yet. Did he has to go anywhere after the office? Yes. I think he'd have gone to the ministry for the NOC. And then maybe he went to city service office from there. Ma'am! What are you looking for? Did you lose something? - Well... No, Mr Dubey. We're celebrating Women's Day today. And as the club secretary, I have to deliver a speech. Oh, okay. - And I can't find the speech anywhere. It was in my hand a while ago. Asha! Where did you keep it? - Yes, ma'am. I don't know where it is. This paper... Is it important? It's very important. Where was it? It was in the fridge. - What! In the fridge, ma'am? After listening to your speech, all women will go cold, ma'am. Stop it, Mr Dubey. Easy. Careful. Get some water. - Yes. No, I'm fine. - Is your health alright? Yes, ma'am. My health is absolutely fine. But the doctors are saying that to keep my heart beating, they'll have to implant a pacemaker. Now, tell me. Who would spend so much on a pacemaker? What are you saying, Mr Dubey? Seriously! You have been working for us for many years now. I'll talk to Rohan. Don't worry about the money. You are doing a big favour on me, ma'am. As Rohan isn't home, I shall take your leave. - Okay. Okay. By the way, ma'am, I wanted to tell you something about Rohan. Not today, Mr Dubey, please. Look how long this speech is! Maybe some other day. - Okay. Some other day. Okay. - I'll take your leave now. Hey! Greetings, Shashank. Goodbye. Hello, Mr Music Director. What's up? How was the recording? Tell me. Hey! I'm talking to you. What happened? Hello, Mr Music Director. Oh my God! I don't want to work in this music industry. They are third-grade people. They will make me mad. I worked really hard to compose all the songs. You know what? Listen to this. It's very good. But they don't care about anything. I can't do this mediocre thing. I left that film. It's okay. You left one film. Why are you getting so frustrated? It was my first film, Natasha. - You idiot! You sister is telling you this. Remember it! One day, a big producer will hire you for his film. Really. And you will be that producer, right? Look, Natasha. I know. I know that you will always support me. But I want to become successful on my own, with my hard work. If you want to do something on your own, learn to handle rejection. Okay? You are right. One day, I'll teach everyone a lesson. That's the spirit. That's like my brother Shashank. Get it? Do so well that the world will bow before you. Someone is calling... Who is it? Hello. Yes. What? What! Oh my God! Really? No, I... Let me try. Yes. Thank you. And take care, please. What happened? What happened? - Someone named Ramzaan called. He said a slab has collapsed at the Bhayandar site. Three people are injured and one is serious. - What! Rohan isn't answering the calls. Natasha, it's high time now. You have to keep an eye on our business now, please. He is managing it well, Shashank. Why are you criticizing Rohan all the time? Do you remember the disputed property in Vasai? And Rohan got it with his cleverness. Even dad had given up on it. But for that, why did he make the Rodrigues family his partner? And you know it very well that the Rodrigues family had troubled dad a lot. From tomorrow, you manage MCC. I'll ask Rohan to do something else. You... You are getting it all wrong. No, I'm not. But what you are saying is wrong. Don't forget. You were also involved in all of that. Mrs Rodrigues is a widow! She is beautiful! And that's why people tried to link Rohan with her. I'm sorry, it's your personal matter. But the way he's going about illegal constructions, I'll talk to him directly. - You won't talk to anyone. Listen to me. Whatever it is, I'll tell him. Before dying, dad handed over the reins of MCC to Rohan with his own hands. Did you forget that? But you wanted to become a music director, right? You weren't interested in MCC. Now, when he is managing it well, why are you interfering? All I want is for him to manage the work properly. Natasha, it's about the reputation of Malhotra Constructions Company. I don't want to talk to you about this. Please. I'm late. Guddu, I'm late. I'm sorry. You're mad! You're looking so stunning. You too. - Thank you. Mr Bandmaster! Why are you home today? How are you? Did you get the film? He will. Very soon, my brother will get a very big film. Of course, he will. He is very talented. Thanks. - Come on, we're getting late. Yes, yes. Come on. Listen. All the best. - Thanks. You take care. Okay? Asha! Asha? Did you make her a member of the club? No, no. Someone from her village is coming. So, she'll come tomorrow. You're staying at my place tonight. You had promised me. Yes, I know my promise. - Okay. Wow! Thank God, we have got the NOC, darling. Really? - Yes! Finally! Manisha, when did you come? Is this how you treat your guests? Today, there's some Women's Day celebration, right? Yes. - Yes. We're getting late. We have to leave. Hurry up, I'm going. I'll take the car. Come fast. Asha, hurry up! - Yes. What took you so long? Come on. - Yes. Rohan. - Yes? I'll also leave. - Have fun. Okay? - Have fun. Rohan. - Yes? Well... Who is Ramzaan? Ramzaan? He might be some corporator. Why? What did he say? A slab collapsed in Bhayandar. Three people are injured, one is serious. I was scared. In Bhayandar? That Mr Dubey... - He had also come. Baby, that's what I'm trying to tell you. I'm making a tower on our land in Bhayandar. The entire builder lobbies are in shock. They are facing losses because of MCC. Now, tell me. If my family members doubt me, how will I work, baby? Alright, I'll get going. Bye. - Bye. Rohan! - Yes? Won't you be coming? I'm so tired. - It's okay. Bye. Bye! Hey, Ramzaan. What's up? Why did you call my wife? Yes, my phone was switched off. So what? What about the labourers? Yes. Before giving the testimony? That's good. Give his family a few thousand rupees and get them to shut up about it. And listen. Getting the NOC is very important. Got it? Goodbye. What's up, Shashank Malhotra? You're back early today. Was there no recording today? Recording with whom? Let me guess. Uh, Sonu Nigam or was it Shreya Ghoshal? Rohan, I quit that movie. Quit? You quit it, or were you kicked out? I've heard that you've become quite frustrated. Don't worry. Your brother-in-law is alive. I'll produce an album for you. Rohan Tiwari presents Shashank Malhotra Live. How does that sound? No. That's not needed anymore. Yes. I've given up on the dream of becoming a music composer. "Every time I placed a bet, I kept on losing. " Chill! Now, what will you do? Tiwari, you're a sickness ailing this house. Those are not my words. That's what the people say. By the way, from tomorrow, I will be coming to the office to handle my company, Malhotra Constructions. Wow! By all means, welcome. Welcome if you are coming. Good riddance if you are leaving. That's my straight and simple philosophy. The chair opposite me is empty in my cabin. Come and be seated there. Who is this Ramzaan? Ramzaan? He's a bigshot. I've entrusted him with the security of my project in Bhayandar. The project in Bhayandar is totally illegal. I've been working hard to make it legal. No, no... You must stop it right away. Get it? I must stop it? I've invested 30 million in it. - Hey! It's not your money. It belongs to MCC. I can take the loss if you lose it, but an illegal construction project? No, man! Never! This is against the principles of our company. Listen, your ancestors are not running this company anymore. Got it? You're still in your nappies. Until you are ready to grease some palms, the projects don't get approved. You get that? Everyone thinks that builders are gold mines. But only we know how much we have to sacrifice on the way. Hey... - You listen to me. Don't interfere, my dear brother-in-law. Okay. I needed to warn you, and so I did. You will not be able to get anything done as you want. Not get anything done? The bank people checked everything. The work is ongoing... - Then stop it. You can't build a 17-storey building there. Rohan, people are hurt. Don't you care at all? But I'm not going to keep quiet. I'll complain to the police. And by the way, MCC has no interest in developing that Vasai property of Mrs Rodrigues. Okay? You've already threatened my Bhayandar project. Now, go ahead and ruin the Vasai project too. I want to see all the correspondence files for the Bhayanadar project. The files are in the office. You can see them tomorrow. Rohan! I want to see them right now. I said the files are in the office. You can see them tomorrow. Alright then. Let's go to the office. We'll go to the office and see them. Come on, let's go. What's the matter? What's the matter? - I was just joking. But you got all serious. Relax! Come on. Chill out, bro! I'll show you. Oh... They're too heavy. Too much work going on. Yes. Quite heavy! Wasn't the file in the office? You're such a builder! These days, the word 'builder' is used as an abuse. It's okay. Are you trying to scare me? I asked for the file. Not a gun. "The poor thing spoke out of turn. " '3 Months Later... ' Guddu! Guddu, what's wrong? Why are you standing in this darkness? Shash... Shashank... Shashank? I heard the tune he used to sing. Guddu, what are you saying? - Yes. What? Sometimes, I hear the tune he was fond of whistling. That day, Rohan was sitting there. I was in the kitchen. I heard the same tune then. Guddu, calm down. Please calm down. Come with me. Rohan said I've gone mad. Guddu, please. I've gone mad. Guddu, what are you saying? Please relax. Please... What are you saying? It's been three months since Shashank died. How can you hear him in his room? Shashank's soul... - Are you crazy? Is that even possible? Do you believe in such stuff? You're an educated woman. Don't think such nonsense. Guddu, please, get a grip on yourself. Calm down. He could have told me once. 'Sis, I have a problem. ' 'I need a solution. ' If he needed anything, I would have got it for him. - I know. I know. - I would have. I know. But what goes inside an artist's mind, no one can understand. Please try to relax. Calm down, okay? Okay, tell me one thing. After Shashank's death, has the company been affected? Affected in what way? Shashank and I were partners, and now, I am the sole owner. Why? I met Advocate Jain a few days ago. He was asking about it. Did you meet him recently? No. Actually, he was the solicitor representing our company at first. But then he had some issues with Rohan. So he stopped working with us. What did he say? 'How's your friend Natasha?' 'What will become of MCC after Shashank's death?' 'Rohan will do as he pleases. ' - What can he do? Mr Jain is just mad at him. Rohan is here. Hi, Manisha. Take care of yourself. I'll get going. Bye, Rohan. - Bye. You're drunk! Well, I... You know Mrs Rodrigues? She put a bottle on the table before the meeting began. It was the inauguration day and... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, darling. After Shashank's passing, I'm also a bit disturbed. Now... What now? An accident took place. What? No. It's not what you think... - No! Not again, Rohan. No... - Not again! Who is it? Who is it? Whose accident? - Nothing happened. Listen to me. Actually... There was an oil spill on the highway. My car skidded and hit a bus stop. There was a girl standing there... Oh my God! - No, no, no... She's okay. She's not... Did you inform the police? It would become a drink-and-drive case. Oh, crap! Darn it! Oh God! What should I do? What did you do with that girl? She's in the car. - What? No, I mean, I couldn't think of anything. What could I have done? I brought her along with me. I can't believe this. Rohan, go get her! Go, I said. Or someone will find out. But Asha... - Asha isn't here. Go! Get her. Quickly. Be careful. Make her lie down. Yes. Leena. Her name is Leena. Leena! Be careful. - No, please lie down. Where do you stay, Leena? Who are you? What has happened to me? It's nothing. You have a small injury. That's it. I want to go home. Please drop me home. - Okay. We will drop you home. Try to relax. Come on. She fainted again. - Is she okay? Rohan, we have to call a doctor. But... - Inform the doctor. I told Dr Mishra... I called him and told him that it was a serious matter. I didn't tell him about the accident. Oh God! Rohan, now, he will think I am serious. He will ask me a lot of questions. What should I do? Why don't you go to the bedroom and rest? I will handle everything. I will call you if I need your help. Is that okay? Fine. Inform me if you need anything. Just look after her, please. - Yeah. Poor girl. What's happening? Darn it. Darn it! What are you doing? Why? Can't I? Excuse me. - Can't I hug my future husband? Let's go inside. Our house, Rohan. Listen, after we get married, Aman will stay here with us. Yeah. - Together. We will live together. Why don't you... Come here. Hide in the kitchen. Go, go, go! Rohan... - Come in, doctor. Sorry for troubling you at night. Relax. What happened to Natasha? Please. What happened? - Doctor... I can't bear to see her like this, doctor. I don't know what to do. It's been two months for the treatment, but there's no improvement. Rohan, she won't get better if you keep worrying about her. Her treatment is our responsibility, but she has lost Shashank, her only brother. I can't bear to see her like this, doctor. Please do something. You know she... She has these mental episodes. What? - Yes. You know that swimming pool... When I returned home from the office that day, I saw that she was trying to enter the pool. I arrived at the right time. I stopped her. Do you know what she said? Doctor, she said she wants a water burial. She can see Shashank's shadow. We have to stop her from thinking about Shashank, but the connection between suicide and the swimming pool is wrong. You have to give it some time. She will be alright. What do I do, doctor? I don't know what to do. I think she's having a nervous breakdown, doctor. Rohan, what do you want to do? Shall we make her lose her mind by putting her in an asylum? Rohan, I am the doctor here. You know, doctor. She... She has weird dreams, doctor. What do you mean? - She... She said she dreamt that I was driving a car and my car skidded on the highway. I hit a bus stop. There was a girl standing there, and I ran her over. She was even calling out that girl's name. Leena. She said I brought Leena here. Here. - Here? And she also asked me whether Dr Mishra came to examine her. No. Didn't you tell her that it was a dream? I told her. I told her, doctor, but you know she called my secretary in the afternoon and asked her whether Leena was alright. And if you see Rohan, tell him to register a case at the police station. What is happening, doctor? Where is she? I'll go and meet her. - She's inside. She went to sleep after taking your medicines. I don't want to disturb her. But I don't know what to do, doctor. Rohan... If you want to change the treatment, I have no objection. Doctor Dixit... What do you think about him? He's good. - Yeah. You should definitely talk to Dr Dixit. Okay? - Yeah. Okay. I'll let her rest. Take care, Rohan. Thank you, doctor. - Okay? I'll leave now. Take care. Thank you so much for coming, doctor. - Not at all. I'll see you out. Thank you again. Oh, my darling! All this was impossible without you. Wow, Rohan! You are too good. The doctor was sympathising with you. Thanks, darling. Now, Friday night at 10:30 pm... But there's a problem. - What problem? My maid Asha... Her sister is getting married on Friday night. I can't wait for Friday, Rohan. I can't wait. - Me too. But... - But what? Will the police believe Natasha committed suicide? - Of course. What if they suspect us? They won't. How can you say that? We can get caught, Rohan. The background story that I came up with is our foolproof plan. Dr Mishra and Dr Dixit's treatment... Everyone knows that Natasha can hear voices. The police won't suspect us. Tell me something. How long do these medicines work? - For at least five to six hours. That's amazing! Six hours! This means we just have to take her to the swimming pool from the bedroom. Right? - Yes. The police will never suspect us. The police will think she had a nightmare. She left the bed and walked towards the swimming pool. And after that, she... Why do we need to do this? It's needed, darling. It's needed. Friday night 10:30 pm. Wait, my love. Rohan and I were there. And Leena was also there. - No, Natasha. When I came here last night, Rohan was alone, and you were in your room. Doctor, wasn't Leena lying down here? You are complicating this for yourself. That was a dream! It was a dream! Seriously, doctor? Doctor, Leena met with an accident. You came here to treat her. I came here yesterday for you, not for Leena. Okay. - Yes. You came here for me. - Yes. And you left without meeting me! Rohan said... - What did Rohan say? Nothing. Did you take the medicines I gave you? Medicine! - Please get some rest. Asha. - Asha is not here. She will come tomorrow. She is attending a wedding. Who is she? Asha! You? Ma'am, the wedding is in two days. In two days? What's wrong with me? What's happening to me? Leave! Dr Dixit! Hi, Mishra here. Dr Dixit? He is a psychiatrist. So, you are convinced that I am mentally unstable! - No! But you are just a little confused and he will only help. Please! - Stop it! Dr Dixit, we can come on Monday, right? Okay. Yes, I'll also be joining. Thank you. Doctor, what is all this? Natasha, please forget about Rohan and Leena's accident until Monday! I am leaving. Take care. Here... Ma'am. Did Mr Tiwari sleep in the study room last night? Who kept this here? - I don't know. Take it away. - Okay. Oh, God! Natasha ma'am! Ma'am! Sorry to disturb you at this hour! But it's high time now. - What happened, Mr Dubey? Ma'am, I am quitting Malhotra Constructions Company. Why? Ma'am, since the past 35 years, I have been working for this company with utmost loyalty! I was 15 years old when Mr Malhotra took me in. I used to work at a tea stall. He was a kind man. He helped unemployed people like us. But I can't do this anymore! I quit, ma'am! - Wait! Just a second, Mr Dubey! Come here. Have a seat. Sit here. - Okay. Now, tell me. Would you like to have some water? - No, I am good. Now, tell me. What happened? Rohan Tiwari's phone was switched off. So, Ramzaan... - What did you say? Ramzaan! He wrote a letter to him. I thought it could be an urgent message. So, I read the letter. Tell me. Is this a valid reason to sack me? What did you tell his name was? - Ramzaan, ma'am! The one working on Bhayandar and Kashimira Project. You must have heard his name. - Yes! Haven't you? Whatever problems are arising in the Bhayandar Project, Ramzaan is responsible for that. He might get punished. He can be done for! He has messed with many people. Anyway, leave it. He will pay for his actions. But it was my duty to warn you. That's why I told you everything. Yes. And one more thing, ma'am. I have been wanting to tell you something. Can I? Yes, tell me. Ma'am, this happened three months ago when Shashank was alive. One day, I went to a restaurant in Dahisar. I heard Rohan Tiwari's voice there. I sat on the table behind him secretly. I mean, his back was facing me. Was Rohan alone? A young girl was with him, ma'am. I thought I would risk everything to find out the truth. What were they talking about? They were talking about Shashank and MCC. 'Natasha and Shashank are the owners of the company. ' 'I am just a manager. And that's the problem. ' That's what he said. Then what did the girl say? She said, 'Do something and become the owner. ' So, what did Rohan say? Rohan said, 'Everything is planned. ' 'I am just waiting for the right time. ' Mr Dubey, are you sure you heard all this? Ma'am, my eyesight might be weak, but I can hear clearly. Mr Dubey. Was that girl Mrs Rodrigues? - No, ma'am. I know Mrs Rodrigues very well. I even remember that girl's name. Her name is Leena. What? - Leena, ma'am! Leena! - Yes! And I saw her several times after that. With Rohan? - No, not with Rohan! I gathered all the information about her. She works at Bharat Medical Store. Bharat Medical Store. - Yes, ma'am. I am sorry if I said anything wrong. - No! No! Thank you so much for helping me! - I was bound to do that. You are Mr Malhotra's daughter. - Please don't tell this to anyone. Ma'am, everyone knows that you are Mr Malhotra's daughter. Mr Dubey, I meant... - I got it. About Leena. I won't tell anyone. Take care. I shall take your leave now. Bye. Hello. Yes, Mr Jain. Natasha here. Yes. Everything is fine. Actually, I wanted to meet you. No, I can't wait until tomorrow. Let's meet today. How about three in the afternoon? Yes. And please don't tell Rohan about it. No. It's not about the divorce. I want to make some changes in my will. Thank you. Mrs Rodrigues. Yeah, darling. Yeah. I know it's Friday night. And it's 10:30 pm. Tomorrow morning, I will talk to you as the managing director of MCC. Yeah. Tomorrow morning, I will give you the good news. I'll call you back. Darling! You look tired. Yeah. I am exhausted. - I think you need a drink. Yes, I guess. I think I'll also get something to eat. Okay. - I am starving. Listen, Rohan! Yes. Don't add anything to the drink. I mean, ice and all. Oh! Yeah! Darling! Yes! Coming! I got some fruits too. Cheers. - Cheers. Bottoms-up, okay? Oh, God! One more? - That's it. Oh my God! I am really tired today. Hey! What is this? - Can I have a dance with you? Sure! That's great. You seem to be in a good mood today. You didn't tell me about Mr Dubey. Mr Dubey? - Yeah. He is good-for-nothing. I had to throw him out of the company. But he told me that you sacked him because he read Ramzaan's letter. He is good-for-nothing. Why are you arguing with me because of him? He wasn't loyal to us anymore. Are you okay? - Ouch! Ouch! - Come on. I suffered a blackout all of a sudden. Sit, sit. I think I want to sleep. Please take me to the bedroom. Are you okay? I think so. Did Mr Dubey come here? Mr Dubey came here. What did he say? - What did he say? What did he say? He said... What? Yesterday... The day before yesterday... - Yes? I... I think he dislikes your working style. I manage this company. What else did he say? Rohan... - Yes. You won't put me on leave indefinitely, will you? No, darling. I love you so much! I love you too, Rohan! I love you so much! Darling. Hello! Hello, Manisha! Can you hear me? Yes... Her condition is very bad. She is having seizures. Yeah. Can you come? No... Not now. Not now. Actually, I'm heading to Pune. She is sleeping right now. I've given her medication. Can you come tomorrow morning and check on her? Please, Manisha! I need your help. Okay. Thank you! Goodnight! Why hasn't Leena arrived yet? Take photographs. Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! Sir! What is your name? Asha... Asha Solanki. What did you do first thing in the morning? After cleaning the floor, I took the garbage outside. Did you return home immediately after dumping the garbage? Yes, sir. I... I mean, as I was coming toward the house, I noticed that spot. Do you mean the swimming pool? Yes, sir. Then? I thought a piece of clothing had fallen there, so I went there to check. Sir, I got very scared. So, I ran inside. I was very scared. Hmm. What time do you get up every morning? Usually, I get up at 6 am. First, I make tea for the boss. I came late today. I wasn't going to come today. Who opened the door when you came in the morning? No one, sir. Did the door open on its own? No, sir. I have a spare key. Usually, I go in and out of the house several times. So, I keep a spare key. Sir, Ramzaan is here. Did he say something? - Sir, he didn't say anything. Lock him up. - Yes, sir. Move! Sir... What has happened, inspector? What has happened? Your introduction? What should I say about myself? - What? Okay. You want to know my name. It's Dubey. I am Shivshankar Dubey. I have a close relationship with this family. This is terrible. Inspector, this is terrible. I never imagined something like that happening to Natasha. Natasha and suicide! Never! Never! This is not a suicide. She has been killed. It's a murder. Mr Dubey. - Yes. Shivshankar Dubey. - Yes. Have a seat. Please sit down. - Okay. Sit. - Yes. According to you, Natasha Tiwari has been murdered, right? Yes. Is there any specific reason for that speculation? Inspector, we met yesterday afternoon. - Okay. She was full of life at that time. Natasha cannot commit suicide. So, both of you were together yesterday afternoon. Yes. We have tea together. We chatted for around a quarter of an hour. Where? Did you meet her here? Not here. There might be many cameras installed here. Considering that, we met at a hotel in Juhu. Why? Inspector, I was employed by Malhotra Constructions Company up until yesterday as a site supervisor. I worked for 35 years with the utmost loyalty. So, you must be very upset about leaving the job. Well, yes. Who accepted your resignation, Natasha or Rohan Tiwari? Inspector, although Natasha was the owner of the company, the decision-maker was Rohan Tiwari. What do you mean? He is no more. What? - He is no more. I mean, he is no longer my boss. Yes. That's true. Oh, God! Inspector, I don't know who cast an evil eye on this house. Shashank Malhotra passed away three months ago. It is said that he committed suicide. But Shashank was in Rohan's way. They would never get along. So, did Rohan kill Shashank? Okay, leave that. What is your opinion about Natasha Tiwari? If she didn't commit suicide, who could be her murderer? Well... That's your job to figure out. That's right. Mr Dubey. - Yes. Did you leave Malhotra Constructions Company or were you booted? Booted! How could you say that? Rohan and I had our disagreements. So, I... I resigned from my position. Don't ever say that I got booted. - I am just inquiring. Please calm down! - Later, you'd say that I murdered Natasha. I killed Natasha. Natasha was murdered... Natasha! I heard that you committed suicide. We discovered a corpse in the swimming pool this morning. Rohan Tiwari is no more. - What? Someone murdered Rohan by stabbing him in the stomach with a knife. Oh, my God! Ma'am, your suffering knows no bounds. First, Shashank, and now Rohan. But you don't worry. I am with you. Be strong. You have all the responsibilities of the company. Take care of yourself. I'll take your leave now. Natasha, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you're feeling okay. Please ask. As you said... Your husband had a business meeting today in Pune. Who was the meeting scheduled with? I don't know. That's strange. Actually, I don't interfere with the company's work. Hmm. Last night, between 10 and 10:30 pm, you guys met here. What did you guys discuss? Actually... I was resting in my room. I was very sleepy. Rohan came, took the suitcase, and left. He tried to talk to me before leaving. But I don't remember what he said. I was very sleepy. Let's forget what happened last night. Do you remember what happened this morning? At around 7:30 this morning, Asha, my house help, rushed inside the house, panting, as if she saw a ghost. That means Asha informed you about the dead body first. Natasha, the suitcase mentioned by you is in police custody. We've recovered it from the car. I think it's safe to say that Rohan was about to leave for Pune when he saw someone by the pool. So, he went near the swimming pool to find out who the stranger was. And he was attacked there. Who could that be? I don't know, inspector. I am as clueless as you are. Please try to remember what happened in the last 4-5 days. Did he fight with someone? Or was he under any kind of stress? Mr Dubey. He used to have altercations with Mr Dubey over silly things related to work. Silly things? Silly things? When a person has to quit his job out of compulsion after working for 30-35 years, he might alter his mental status. What do you think about Manisha Patel? What do you mean? How was her relationship with Rohan? Cordial. I mean, she is my friend. As per our information, there was a time when Manisha used to hate Rohan. She even cut ties with you. Really? So, you are trying to link Rohan's murder with an accident that occurred four years ago. Inspector, what will Manisha gain by doing all this now? It wasn't an ordinary accident, Natasha. That accident with Rohan's car left Manisha's 12-year-old sister permanently handicapped. Manisha was looking for a golden chance to take revenge on Rohan. Did you never think about that? Look, I am not making an accusation directly. I just want to find out the motive behind this incident. Inspector... - Sir. It's Mr Jain, the advocate. My condolences. You asked your lawyer to come here! Yes, I asked him to meet me two days ago. The situation was different two days ago. I mean, your husband, Rohan, is no more. Despite that, you want to meet the lawyer. Honestly, I don't want to meet anyone. If you want, I won't meet him. - No... You may meet him. After all, he is your legal advisor. Please. I am sorry to hear about Rohan. It's really very sad. Mr Jain, you and Rohan had issues. Any special reason behind this? There are plenty of reasons. But this is not the time to discuss it. Rohan was involved in many illegal activities while keeping you and your brother in the dark. Gradually, everything will be exposed. I didn't want to create bogus and illegal papers for Malhotra Constructions. That's why I was fired. Just one thing, Natasha. This inspector isn't very cordial. Be careful. Why would I be afraid of him? You changed the will in haste. And after that, Rohan was murdered. I took notice of that. So, I am this inspector will notice it too. Please understand. Why did you change the will? Any specific reason, Natasha? Actually, Rohan was having an affair with a girl. Oh! Do you know that girl? Yes. Her name is Leena. Did you inform the inspector about this girl? You are making a mistake by hiding this information from the police, Natasha. You might be the first person to be under suspicion for this murder. This can be a motive for murder. If you think it's awkward, I'll talk to them... - No. I'll talk to the inspector. I'll leave now. What will we do with this will? As it is, we'll have to make a lot of changes to it because of Rohan's death. You may keep it with you for now. Okay. You take care. I'll see you later. Bye. Bye. Inspector. Well, I want to talk to you about yesterday's incident. Go ahead. Actually, my brother, Shashank, passed away three months ago. And I became mentally disturbed. I mean, I felt I lost everything. During that time, I came to know about my husband's affair. I figured it out. That girl's name was Leena. And I thought I'd talk to Rohan about it. But I knew he would call me crazy. That's why I decided I should meet Leena. She used to work in Bharat Medical Store. So, I met her. And after that, it felt great. She was an innocent girl. I wonder how she fell for Rohan. Can you imagine? Rohan promised to marry her. My husband promised another girl to marry. It pulled the rug out from under me. And Leena assured me that she wouldn't tell anyone about it, not even Rohan. And I figured one thing out. That she was scared of Rohan. She was scared of him! Why? I don't know. But she told me everything honestly. You know, inspector, Rohan was about to push me into the swimming pool after giving me an overdose of sleeping pills. He wanted to kill me. He was planning my murder. And later, he would have termed it a suicide. They both hatched this plan together. But thank God Leena met me. And after that, she changed her mind. So, since Leena didn't get involved in the plan, it made Rohan frustrated. So, he stabbed himself to death. Tell me what exactly happened last night. I'll tell you. Rohan came home at around 10:30 last night. And he was making a drink for himself here. He also offered me a drink. I also had a drink. I was hungry. So, I brought something to eat. I don't know. I felt weird after having the drink. And my head started spinning. And I slept off here on the couch. I wasn't asleep. I was pretending to be asleep. After that, Rohan called Manisha. Manisha! Why? He wanted to show people how good a husband he was and how much he loved his wife and cared about her. I was so scared, inspector. He was walking to and fro from here to there. And I was lying on the couch. I knew, inspector. I knew he would carry me and push me into the swimming pool. I was about to die. I was so scared. I couldn't think straight. And at that time... At that time, I played a dangerous game. I killed Rohan before he could kill me. You killed Rohan Tiwari! Yes. By the way, how did you commit this murder, Mrs Tiwari? By stabbing him in his stomach. Oh, you were well-prepared. You brought a weapon to kill him. Obviously, inspector. What else do you expect? I know my husband is about to kill me. Do you think I can't keep a knife for my self-defence? Why didn't you seek help from the police instead of doing all this? You want me to seek help from the police! Seriously! It's been three months since my brother passed away. But we haven't found out if he was murdered or committed suicide. They would have called me crazy. Okay. So, what did you do to the knife, the murder weapon? I washed it, wiped it and kept it in the kitchen. Then? Then I... Then I went to the room upstairs. I took Rohan's suitcase and the car keys. I kept Rohan's suitcase in the car and left the key dangling in the car. I must say you are very smart lady, Mrs Tiwari. Carry on. I was very scared, inspector. I knew if someone found out about it, I'd be in trouble. I dragged Rohan's body from here and took it to the swimming pool there. You dragged such a heavy body by yourself! Inspector, I had so much strength in my arms at that time. And trust me, I have no regrets. I am not sorry for killing my husband and becoming a widow. Yes, Sidhu. Yes. Okay. Yes, okay. I need more information about that knife. Well, it was a sharp knife. After committing the murder, what did you do with it? Inspector, I told you! Tell me again! What did you do with it? I washed that knife properly with detergent. Then I wiped it clean and kept it in the drawer in the kitchen. You are lying. - Why would I lie? You are lying! - Why? What if I tell you, you are making up this story of Rohan's murder? Do you think I'm mad? - Hold on! Sleeping tablets, pretending to be asleep, the clean knife... - Oh God! You dragged the dead body... All of this is a lie. It's nonsense! - Inspector... No. - You haven't committed this murder. You are trying to save someone. Who is it? - Who? Shivshankar Dubey? - No! Manisha Patel? - No! One thing is for sure. You haven't committed this murder. I did it, Inspector! How many times should I tell you that I did it? - Sir. Sir, Rohan Tiwari was attacked by this knife. We found it near the backdoor some 15 minutes ago. It still has bloodstains in it, sir. Do you want to see this knife? You haven't committed this murder. I had told Raghuvanshi... You haven't shown it to me yet! Where is he? - Sir, I'll tell him. The whole... Excuse me, Inspector. One minute, please. Natasha is not feeling well. Dr Mishra gave her some medicines. So, she is resting. No, don't bother her. - Okay. I need you ask you some questions. Me? About what? Rohan Tiwari had accidentally injured your sister, right? She was disabled. So, towards Rohan Tiwari, you... - I had hatred against him. I hated him. And I couldn't think of anything except revenge. But as they say, time is the biggest healer. So, as time went by, I forgot everything. You are very sensible. And Inspector, Natasha has done many things for me. You know, when I was 15, I lost my parents. And Natasha took care of me, supported me. I really don't know how I would repay the favour. So, with whatever happened, I've just... I have moved on. You told me everything openly. I appreciate it. I always say things openly, Inspector. By doing that, the other person doesn't go through any trouble. And sleep... You get a very good sleep. Even you should try it. I would have tried, but as police officers, we have to keep many things secret. And about sleep... Those who disturb our sleep, we don't let them sleep peacefully. Why are you still here? - Why did you get up? Go and rest. Go home. How long have you been here? Yes, I'm going. You take care. Okay? - Come on. Bye. - Bye. Natasha, we found your husband's wallet from the garden behind the swimming pool. You will be surprised to know that his wallet was empty. He was going to Pune with an empty wallet! Don't you find it strange? Actually, I find it very strange. Besides credit cards, Rohan always carried 20000-30000 rupees. Then where is that money? Did someone kill him for the money? I met Leena in the afternoon. She accepted that she was having an affair with Rohan. Without any hesitation. She even told me about how you met her. Everything was fine. I verified everything. Except for one thing. Your husband was planning to give you sleeping pills before pushing you into the swimming pool. Well, that's a lie. You have made up that story. That's what Leena believes. What do you think? I am not judgemental. Natasha, many times, when there are no evidence, the police can't get to the criminal. And we are compelled to close such cases. The unsolved cases. I'm writing a book. 'The Cases That Police Couldn't Solve'. And I try to solve those cases in my way. I mean, I would look at all the possibilities and zero in on the criminal. How is the idea? Sorry. - It's good. Yes. Excuse me. No, that is not the protocol. Listen to me. Once I have made myself very clear... Natasha ma'am... Mr Dubey? You scared the heck out of me! I had to tell you something important, ma'am. I was waiting for the Inspector and Manisha to leave. Why did you want to see me secretly? What is it? Ma'am, you had told me to stay in touch. But today, I have come here with a motive. Well, some things should be told secretly. It can't be said openly, before anyone. That's why I thought of sharing this information with you. And take some information from you. This deal will make us both knowledgeable. We can update our knowledge, ma'am. What is it? Say it clearly. I have come to talk about the swimming pool incident. Yes. What do you want to say? Ma'am, I knew that Rohan Tiwari was going to Pune that night. And that's why, in his absence, I came here to meet you. Did you come here that night? - Yes, ma'am. And as soon as I opened the gate the stepped inside the bungalow, at that time... - What happened at that time? At that time, I saw you outside. Yes... Where did you see me? - Near the swimming pool. What was I doing? You were sitting near Rohan Tiwari's dead body, and you were checking his pockets. What else did you see? - Was this not enough? I didn't have the courage to see anything after that. But I came here the next day to see what's going on here. And I put up such an act in front of the police inspector as if I don't know anything. That means you knew everything beforehand! And you intentionally remained silent before the police. Yes, ma'am. Because I didn't want to create an issue for you. Hmm... Yes. - And now? Now... - Now you want something in return, right? Yes. If I had said it then, I wouldn't have got anything. But now, I'll get something. What? - Rs 30 million. When should I come to take it, ma'am? Rs 30 million? - Yes, ma'am. Rs 30 million! - Yes. Mr Dubey, what are you dreaming of? You know... I want to tell you something. - Go on. You showed me your cards for nothing. Sometimes, you should keep in mind that the other person could have a trump card. And at this time, I have that trump card! What? I don't understand anything. - I'll tell you. Don't I know that you have a weak heart as well as weak eyesight? And that too in darkness. Okay. Tell me something, Mr Dubey. That day, when you saw me, where were you standing? Near the bungalow's gate. That means you were 40-50 feet away from the swimming pool. So, give me 50,000 rupees less. But give me the money. I saw you. Why are you so sure that it was me? It was you. It could be Asha too. - Now, it's Asha! Whatever, forget it, ma'am. Whether it was Asha or you, the fact of the matter is that Rohan Tiwari is dead. A tea stall... - Give me my 30 million. I picked you up from a tea stall. Give me 30 million rupees, ma'am. You said I was like your daughter. - That's all in the past. Mr Malhotra is no more. Give me my 30 million rupees. - Stop, Mr Dubey! Drop it, Mr Dubey. - Otherwise, I... I'll go to the media. - Let it be. No, no... I'll go to the media and say Natasha... Dubey, stop. - That Natasha is such a woman... She's a two-faced woman. - Dubey, enough! Siddhu, collect everything. Doctor, how's Natasha doing? Not good. Actually, her loyal and old employee Shivshankar... - Dubey! She told me on the phone. - Yes. He was a heart patient, right? - Yes. She's in a big shock. What's going on in her mind, I can't figure out. I was seated in front of her, but she was lost in thought. I just hope Dr Dixit can help her. Dr Shyamsundar Dixit? - Yes. The psychiatrist? - Yes. We're meeting him on Monday. I think she really needs him. Doctor, from the outhouse, the police took a high-tech music system in custody. It has a remote and timer facility. Could be Shashank's. He was crazy about sound systems. I know he was a musician, but... But I have a theory that Rohan used this music system to prove Natasha clinically insane. What? But... Natasha. What happened? Doctor, what is this? What do you mean? I just told you. Did you forget again? One tablet before you sleep. Okay? Take care. I'll see you, inspector. Why did you do that? I don't know. I just don't know, inspector. I... I don't know what's happened to me since the morning. Let me tell you about last night... Mr Dubey came here. You know he was blackmailing me. He tried to scare me and threatened me. He came and sat on this couch right next to me. How dare he! And then he scared me. He said that he found out everything about the swimming pool. He said he found out everything about Rohan's murder. He wanted 30 million rupees to keep his mouth shut. And he spoke to me so rudely. To date, no one has ever insulted me like that. I just lost it, inspector. I picked up this bottle and hit him on the head... You killed him? When did this incident happen? Around 11:30 pm. For your information, let me tell you that Mr Dubey died this morning at 7:40 am. At the hospital. He died of a heart attack. - No. No, inspector. I killed Mr Dubey. I remember very clearly. He tried to blackmail me, and I was angry... - He must have come here and threatened you. But his death is not on you, there's no connection. What? Are you... sure? Why would I lie? Oh my God! What's wrong with me? I keep imagining strange things. My head is splitting. I don't know what's happening. Hey, Natasha, you... You... You should rest. I'll get going. Natasha, I feel you should go and meet Dr Dixit. I don't want to meet anyone, inspector. And I won't go alone anyway. If you want, I can come with you. Natasha! Natasha... Leena? - Yes. Weren't you going to your hometown? When did you come back? Leena. - Ma'am. Hi. - Hi. Uh, books? - Yes. You asked for these books, right? - Yes. Thank you. Okay, bye. Books. By the way, I also wanted to give you something to read. Oh, really? - Yes. What is it? The police department is thinking of closing the Rohan Tiwari case. For the first time, I am leaving a case unsolved. I tried my best to solve it, a shot in the dark, but only you can tell me if I've hit the mark or not. So who is the murderer according to you? Read the diary and you'll find out. Guddu, give me the car keys. I'll return it by tomorrow evening. Sure. I'll get it in a sec. Manisha! - What? Why did you pick up the diary? What do you mean? Why can't I pick it up? Give me the diary. - I won't. What will you do? Why did you touch the diary? - What do you mean? Just give it back, man. - I won't. What's the big deal? - Return it or... Or what? Return it, I said. Just give it back. What the hell! Are you crazy? Why are you acting so aggressively? Sorry. Sorry. - What is the big secret in it? Tell me. Tell me. - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Actually, this diary contains Inspector Khanna's solution to the puzzle that is Rohan's murder. And honestly, I don't want anyone to know... No one is going to find out anything. What do you mean? What do you mean? - I mean, the night Rohan was murdered, I had come here. What? You were here? - Yes. And you're telling me now? Actually, Rohan had called me here. But he asked me to come here the next morning, but I was so worried for you. I thought something was fishy, so I came here that night. And what did you see? Guddu, Rohan... To save you from being accused of murdering Rohan, I had to do something. I was the one who took out all the money from his wallet and threw it in the bushes. It was I who put the knife in the post box. I made it look like he was murdered for the money. Oh my God! Oh my God! That means... - What happened? Shivshankar Dubey saw you with Rohan's body on that night. And all the while, he thought it was me. Thank God, Manisha. Thank God. Thank God he was mistaken, or you... Dubey is out of the picture. And the inspector will also not find anything. You need to take care of yourself. You understand? - Okay. Everything is taken care of. Okay. You also calm down, and you should go. You should go. You must be getting late. Please take care of yourself, buddy. Bye. And listen. Thank you. You are my friend, and you will always be. Got it? Bye. 'Darling. ' 'You look tired. I think you need a drink. ' 'Ouch! - Are... Are you okay?' 'I blacked out all of a sudden. ' 'Sit, sit, sit. ' 'Hello! Hello, Manisha. Can you hear me?' 'Yes. Actually, ' 'her condition has gotten worse. She is having a mental breakdown. ' 'Yeah. Can you come?' Natasha! You wanted to kill me by giving me an overdose of sleeping pills, right? - What? You wanted others to think that I committed suicide, right? What nonsense are you talking about? - You killed Shashank too, right? You made it look like he committed suicide too. Leave my hand. - Will you do this to everyone, Rohan? Will you do this to everyone? You wanted people to think I was crazy! - Are you crazy? You wanted to prove to everyone that I was crazy. But I didn't let that happen. Wait, Rohan Tiwari. Wait! Today, I will talk! Where did I go wrong, Rohan? What am I lacking? Answer me! Why did you do this to me? You want my property, right? You want my property, right? Take my property! Will you kill people for the sake of their property? Take every f**king thing! Your girlfriend Leena... You put on an act about her accident. I met her at Bharat Medical Store. She told me everything. Everything. Your game is over, Rohan Tiwari. Your girlfriend from Vasai, Mrs Rodrigues... She is not just your girlfriend, she is also your mistress. She told me that as well. I've warned her to stay away from you. And you, Rohan Tiwari! You! You loser! I gave you everything. You killed my brother. You f**king killed my brother! Shut up! - The house you are living in belongs to me! Just shut up! - Rohan Tiwari, your game is over! Get out! - Shut up! Get out! Get the f**k out! - I said shut up! Get the... Shut up! Ouch! Rohan, stop! Stop! Rohan, stop. Don't do this. You dug your own grave. - No! No! - Leena! What is she doing here? Leena... No! - Stop! No. - Leena, no. No, no, no. - No. Don't give him the knife. No, Rohan. - No. Give me the knife back. - No. Leena, no! - Leena! No, Rohan. - Look at me. Don't be afraid. Give it! - Leena, no! Rohan! - Stop! Rohan! - Stop! Stop! Rohan, stop! Rohan, please stop! Stop! Stop! Rohan... What have I done? Leena... What have I... Rohan... Leena... Leena, wait. No! - Come here. Stop! Stop! Don't make noise, or someone will hear you. Rohan... - Leena, stop! Stop! Stop! Look, had you not come here, one of us would have died. Please understand. You saved my life. Leena, please. Relax! What have I done? - It happened by mistake. It happened in self-defence. We didn't do it on purpose. Leena, listen to me. Someone might come in. Listen. Listen to me. We have to throw him in the swimming pool. We have to make it look like he was attacked outside and died. No! - Please help me, Leena. Leena, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come on. Help me. - No... Come on. Help me, Leena. Come on. Carry him. Drag him out. - I am scared. Leena, come on. Carry him. Okay. Have some water. Drink some water. Relax. And Leena, listen. You were not here. Do you understand? You weren't here. You don't know anything. Listen to me. If anyone questions you, tell them you don't know anything. Okay? You were never here. Okay? - Yes. Okay? - Yes. Yes. Read the diary? Yes. You were right. Natasha, you didn't kill him. But you were a part of this conspiracy. That night if Rohan hadn't died, you would have died. In order to protect Leena, you pretended to have a mental breakdown. Leena saved your life. You wanted to repay her, right? Inspector, to be honest, she was dragged into this mess. It wasn't her fault. I know. You both tried to save each other. I realise that. I went to meet Leena a couple of days ago. She started sweating looking at me. Her behaviour confirmed my doubts. One culprit is in front of you. The truth is that you were victims of circumstance. This murder was an act of self-defence. The court will decide that. Have faith. You will get justice.
