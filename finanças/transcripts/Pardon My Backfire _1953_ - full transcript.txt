But gee, Papa, it costs money to get married. Give the boys a little time. I will. Very little. If they don't marry you this week, you'll marry those three nice plumbers down the street. STOOGES: Oh, no, not that. We'll earn enough money in a week to get married. Yeah, we'll keep our garage open night and day. We'll fix more cars than you ever heard of. See that you do. One week. No more. Okay, Pop, okay. Come on, let's get busy. Hold it, hold it. I'm not going till I get a piece of that cake. Oh, so you want some cake? In the worst way. That's exactly how you're gonna get it. Oh, no, no, Moe. No, no. No, Moe. No, no. GIRLS: Papa, you spoiled our cake. Retreat. [ALL SCREAM] LARRY: Oh, oh, no you don't. SHEMP: Get out of the way. LARRY: I... I was here first. MOE: Come on, get moving. Get around. Now, wait a minute. What's the matter with you? [ALL SCREAM] [AIR HISSING] Hey, fellas, we'd better get busy and make a lot of money if we don't want to lose our girls. Okay, then, get over there and tune up that old car. Shemp, you get the tire patches ready. [SPITS] Mm! [GRUMBLES] Hey, Shemp, come here. See if you can find a leak in this tire. Hey, I can't find any leak. Oh, you're not doing it right. Here. Get over here. Another inch. [CAR HORN HONKING] You did it on purpose. I did not. I did not. Oh! Hey, Larry. Shut that horn off. I can't. It's stuck. Come on. [HORN HONKING CONTINUOUSLY] Hey, Larry, what happened? I'm dying and you're asking me riddles? Quiet. Now, if I can only find the right wire. Larry. Larry. Larry. Look at this wire. It's alive. What wire? Now I don't see it. Well, maybe you can see this. You nincompip. The word is nincompoop. Who asked you? I got a good mind... Ouch! Ouch! Oh, my poor, sweet, dear, cute, beautiful little head. Well, take your dear, sweet, cute, little beautiful head with the ugly kisser and go back there and see if the stoplight's working. Go ahead. Wise guy. The light must be off because it ain't on. I'll check the connection. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [BACKFIRE EXPLODES] Call your shots, will you? Sorry, kid. Pardon my backfire. [HORN HONKING CONTINUOUSLY] Ow. Ouch. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. [GASPING] [GROANS] Oh! Oh! [HORN HONKING WAVERS] Hey, I think I got the right one. What makes you think so? Instinct. [HORN HONKING STOPS] [LOUDLY] Then fix it with your instinct. You probably got the headlight wires. What are you yelling about? So you can hear me over the horn. The horn has stopped. Oh, so it is. [HORN HONKING RESUMES] You imbecile! Never touch nothing with your bare hands. Spread out. Let an expert show you how to disconnect it. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [SCREAMING] [BIG-BAND MUSIC BLASTING OVER CAR RADIO] You stopped the horn but started the radio going. You know, I, uh... ANNOUNCER [OVER RADIO]: We interrupt this program to bring you a newsflash. Three dangerous convicts made a successful break from the San Brandon penitentiary. They commandeered a car which has little gas in it. All gas stations and garages are warned to be on the lookout. What do you know about that? These men are dangerous and may be armed. Be careful. A bulletin just handed me states there will be a reward for their apprehension. I wonder how much. Fifteen-hundred dollars. Thanks. You're welcome. Yes, you're welcome to attend the opening of the White and Gold Market, which sponsors this program. Boy, if we could only capture those guys and get the reward, we'd be a cinch to get married. Yeah. [HORN HONKING RESUMES] [HORN HONKING STOPS] I fixed it. [HORN SPUTTERING] Oh, they got me. [CAR HORN HONKS] That thing is haunted. Yeah. [HONKING PERSISTS] MOE: Hey, hey, customers. Left turn. Right, right. All right, over there, please. That's fine. What can we do for you, sir? Well, you can see that we are out of gas. And this fender has to be repaired and painted. But quickly. If you hurry, I pay you double. We'll hurry and how. We'll be through in a jiffy. Would you step in the office, please? Thank you very much. Thank you. Hey, they're nice guys. Yeah, and that's a slick chick. You know, I think they hit something. Listen, every time you think, you weaken the nation. Go get the tools. Oh... You know, it just occurred to me. If those men recognize us, they will talk. I believe it might be advisable to forestall such an eventuality, don't you? No. Oh, not here. They might see us. Hey, come on, stop stalling, Moe. We got plenty of work to do. Okay. Oh! Hey, are you still sleeping? Come on, we got... We got to finish everything here today, you know. Hey, let me see that rasp. What? Hm. Come here, you. Wait a minute. Ow! Ow! [WHIMPERING] Now, sawdust-head, get that torch and weld the mudguard. Go on. Listen, lamebrain. Let an expert show you how to do this. Never turn your back on people with a hammer in your hand. With you, a hammer is a lethal weapon. Remember that. I'll show you what I mean by an expert. Now look. See what you done? I didn't know there was anybody behind me. [DROPS HAMMER] Oh, boy, you sure broke it. MOE: Yeah, the guy'll be burned up, won't he? Hey, Moe, we're gonna have to replace this windshield. You said it. We sure will. [SNIFFING] Hey, I smell rubbish burning. Yeah, so do I. Oh, it's me! Don't go away, Moe. [WHIMPERING] Hold still, Moe. I'll put it out with this wet lacquer. Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! I'm losing my mind! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho. Turn around, Moe. Okay. Oh, oh, oh. How do you feel, kid? Like a baked potato. [LAUGHS] [GIBBERING] That's a hot one. There. Hot potato, eh? Come on, fellas, we gotta get busy here. Go flirt with those men to make them hurry. But don't overdo it. Remember, you're my girl. You're always jealous. Gentlemen. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh... Would you be darlings and hurry for me? I'm awfully late. [STOOGES BARKING] [HOWLING] Oh, sure, sure. Go on, get busy. Anything for a beautiful chick like you. Come on, sit down. Make yourself at home. We'll show you some real speed. And some sweet music for a sweet thing. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING OVER CAR RADIO] There we are. ANNOUNCER: Here are the latest reports on the three escaped convicts. They are driving an old 1940 black sedan, and are accompanied by a woman. They robbed a clothing store and all are wearing brand-new suits. The leader has a prominent scar on his left cheek. Remember that, fellas, in case we run into such guys. Okay. The woman is wearing a light-gray dress and is of average height. One of the men is short, pudgy. [SNAPS RADIO OFF] You have been a perfect darling to give me so much attention. Oh, I'm always happy to give a lady a helping hand. Don't be so generous. Hey, take it easy, mister. We were just listening to the radio. They were telling about three escaped convicts wearing nice business suits, like you. And one of them had a scar on his face like you. And... Hey, it is you! Call the cops. I'm gonna blast them. No. No shooting. We will kill them silently. Knives are quiet. Very good. Now, wait a minute. I gotta get married next week. I am going to kill you to death. That's too permanent. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. Oh! Baby, I'm sorry, what I do this. I will kill them for this. Darling, speak to me. Talk to me. A couple of syllables. Something. Baby. Hey, buster. My name is not Bu... [SCREAMING] Ow! How do you like that? [DRILL HAMMERING] You like that? Oh! I will kill you! No, no. Put down that toe-stabber. Don't, mister. Remember, your mother and my mother are both mothers. I'll get you this time. Now I'm mad. Why you. I'll fix you. [BIRD SINGING] [MOE SCREAMING] I'm gonna get myself a cheap lawyer. Ow! Oh! Ow! Help! Let me out! Help! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Help! Let me out of here! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Let me out of here. LARRY: Moe! Shemp! I kill them too. Moe! Shemp! THUG: I kill this Moe and the Shrimp and you together, you coward. Come back and die like a man. I'll get you. Who do you think...? [SCREAMING] Pardon my monkey wrench. [GROANING] All right, come on, boys. Tie him up with the other guys. Right. All right. Taking a round corner. MOE: Get the cops. [HORN HONKING] Moe. Shemp. Larry. LARRY: Nettie. SHEMP: Hettie. MOE: Betty. It's the girls. Hiya, girls. And they brought the cops. We brought you some customers. Yeah. They broke down in front of our house. You got here just in time, officers. Yeah, we captured the three escaped convicts and their girlfriend. They're over there. GIRLS: Gee, you're heroes. You're wonderful. And with the reward, we can get married. Give us all a kiss, huh? Yeah. [GIRLS GIGGLING] Mwah. Oh! I'm poisoned. Oh. Get away. [♪♪♪]
