A father has to go to the police. So, now get out. I want myself to talk to Kurt. Urey, well, you will not have you...? Heck, you can not talk to me with his daughter? Get out of here! Villa hugged her. Strangely, I did not understand, it's your Kurt. Listen, and it has already taken to the police? The police because of this did not move. We talked with them yesterday. They do not care that Kurt is sick, she lives with me. They have to make it myself written statement. With cops always the case. And, this villa will be nothing? And how Kurt feels? Cries. And then suddenly, at some point, it do not fucking understand what happened. Hi! Well, you have not planted? Do not sell him. - Do you, Willie, not a drop of shame. Dare here in the village still appear! I'm not selling you. As it is, I'm crying! - I do not need your money. Take the money! - She said she did not sell! Go to hell all! - Take your money!

On the bus I have no more money. So late buses do not go. And went on foot? - So far! Well, yes! You're used to going, of course. Let's buy something with it. Drink? No, please, no. I love these cookies. I have them at home, too, to give their rabbits. What, you feed rabbits cookies? Only on holidays. So, now I like your rabbit? I do not even know who you are. What do I say to a child? I do not know, why should I tell you all this. In the village all the talk about the case with Kurt. And if it is, you fool, she really wanted? It just can not be understood? She did not wanted to go home, when we followed her to the Villa arrived. Its just fooled! Now the whole village knows that it is an idiot. Kurt, I said in the village that you Now you will not deliver the mail. Why? I think it would be better if you're there will not appear for some time. And that, my father was still very angry? - I think he's all right. Can I stay here, in his room? Yes, you can stay. You do not drink? We do not have anything. I said, Why have you got in touch with Kurt? What about her that? It is absolutely normal. It's still not quite normal when adult woman crawls under the bed. I was beginning to think all. About what? I will not tell you. How much do you actually years? Thirty. - What? Do not be! It can. You're just used to not look at me. Wait, wait, let me see. Why are you looking at me? How so? That's so weird. Yes it is your eyes are weird. What? I can not look at them for a long time. I'm tickled! What happened? I'm sorry... I felt dizzy. All right? What happened? I can not move! I have a cramp. Wait, wait... What, what are you laughing at? I feel so good. You know, when you're smiling at you the happiest smile in the world. Good morning! - Hello, hello. Look, who is now almost goes round? Kurt did not appear. Well, yes, it Urey probably drove to the hospital. He did not give a daughter to a psychiatric hospital, too proud. Hello! - Hello, hello. Yuri, did you hear? Villa lost. - How is it? Well, not looking for work anywhere, the store did not come. Most likely, he fled, he has no life here. If the store is more vodka do not sell that he is there to do. Have a nice day! Kurt, what are you doing? God forbid, Kurt, darling! I did not think that to me this is also going to happen. What will happen? Kurt, no one knows in advance. This villa sleeping with all the other women in Ilbo. You do not even need to know said about them. Kurt, he did not deserve, that because of him... Yes, I already knew. Kurt! Now take a deep breath, hold your breath. Now you can breathe. Kurt, my dear... Well, now you're waiting for this Villa? Honey, he does not return. People say it all went, and no one knows where. Listen to my mother and me. He's just using you, because you're sick and do not understand everything. Kurt, honey, look at me. Look, it's me, your daddy. Daddy was so worried about you! If this drunkard again announced promise me you do not go with him. Kurt! Look at me! You can not be with him more to go! Come here! That's it. We have that here and we live here? Do you want to live in a bath? Do not think too much about all this. About what? - The life here in the bath. I tell you that, do not you like me? I'm doomed. Villa, is that you in there? Well go into the house. I'll give you something to eat. I have cancer. Analyses showed that the tumor shrank. Now we have to wait a couple of months, obsleduem again know the final result. In my view, there is hope. You can go home. And with alcohol and smoking - as I said. Well, yes... Villa, I'm not kidding, If you want to drink - remain without a voice. and the treatment here will be useless. So the deal. All right. At the end of a long driveway - Small World And its top I can not see But my little life here - a here all my pain and my last home... Kurt! Kurt! Damn it... See it here. What are you doing here? - I came to see you. How are you doing? I'm a little sick. I had a whole month in Tallinn. I was in the hospital. I was told that I recover, only voice still hoarse. Wait a minute... I have something for you. These are the cookies. Come here! No, I'm not going. What is it? I do not even know What do you think about me. You also sleep with all the women in the village. I now come to you! I misunderstood. You know, I'm a little bit of that... Kurt, I thought about you every single day. You just disappeared! - Kurt! Go away, go away, he'll kill you! - Well, we'll see! Fucking man! What are you doing? Where do you stick your nose? - What, you can not even talk? Heck, with a drunk, like you, No one in the village will not speak. Kurt, you have, what to say to him? Kurt! Kurt... Well, what are you doing with my daddy? No, Daddy, no. This guy wants to see as you love your daddy. Kurt, show him. Now. Well, here you want? You want her more disgrace in front of people? Yes? Drink. I did not drink for a month. Kurt, come hell in the hallway vodka. I do not know where she is. - On a shelf near the door to the pantry. Go-go, run! What did you say to her, her to go with you? What did you do then, tell me? What difference does it make? - Say it! Come on, tell me! I just called her. Come with me! You're lying, you bastard! What happened to your voice, What are you sick? Well, if not fatally, then... Share Kurt, what are you man! Go all in the ass, damn it. Next time, I'll kill you! Gavnyuk! Kurt, you're not sick? No, I'm just bad. Can I get you a glass of water? Yes, thank you. Malle, your villa brawled at the store. Drunk as a skunk. Get out of here! Go sleep it off! - You do not nobody know dick about everything. Get out of here, what are you hanging around here, you bastard! And what do you want this window frame made? I do not remember, I love you so fucked. Let's go home, the Villa! - Do not touch me, damn! What if Kurt in fact pregnant? An abortion and everything. There's nothing to discuss. Yes, you have enlarged uterus. And the analysis is done, but I think - you are pregnant. So - congratulations! You can dress up. And what's the plan? We will bear, right? - No. We want to have an abortion. Kurt, is that true? - It makes no sense to ask her anything. One used it drunk, okay? - You told the police? Stated, but they did nothing. - How so? They want Kurt said to myself, but... Kurt, wait a bit for the door. Kurt, then I'll talk with you individually. You see, how it affected her. And she went to a psychiatrist? - That it is not necessary, it's just a little inhibited. You see, if Kurt does not officially sick, I can not have an abortion optionally mother. You talked to her the most? - You just do not understand. From that moment I realized that it is not quite normal... You can not imagine she is afraid of everything. No, she's not stupid. She's just scared. In the village nobody touches it. She even graduated from 8th grade. It goes round -mail, she copes. But everyone knows that we should not talk to her. She did not respond. Ask anyone - all say that this is a drunkard kill little... In any case, I have to talk to her. I do not understand why you not issued to her disability. You would pay allowance. - We do not need aid. Our family earns enough. We can take care of your child. Kurt, I know what you mean, but you you do not want a sick child. There can be born healthy child. Kurt, I beg you! Be reasonable! You know perfectly well, What will happen now. My father will not let keep the baby. But, Mom, I want this baby! Do you have children, at Kaarin also have children. Kurt, please... You're sick! Kurt... Villa simply not the man. Come on, talk to my dad. And please, be reasonable. Mom! So what did they say? Kurt was pregnant. Talking about abortion? Kurt itself should want it. Kurt! Kurt, listen... You did not tell the doctor? You do not want this baby? I want to. If the baby is born, you fly out of the house faster than a turd. And daddy you no more. All right? Do you hear me? - This is my baby. Heck, Kurt... From this gavnyuka, that you have used and fuck all the women in a row I want a baby! This is my baby! - Damn! Yuri! Stop it! You will do as I say! Damn, where are you, bitch, go? Say you understand me! I can not hear! - Yes... I can not hear, tell me what I knew now! Will you go to the doctor, say what you want to have an abortion! I can not hear you! - Yes! Yes... Get out of here! What are you doing there? I need the money. Well, what do you mean so just surrender? What should I do? You know nothing about Kurt. Well, tell me. Give me the money! - Do not give! Hey, back off! You're not going drunk on the tractor! You do not care about anyone. You can not like this get drunk to death! Did you ever thought about Kurt like that? I leave you this cookie. You did it, too, liked it, huh? - Yes. Where are you this poem to find me? And you liked it? Kurt! Where's Kurt? - And why did you come? Kurt! Kurt! Hello! Hello Kurt, come on, let's go! I wanted to tell you - our Kertu pregnant from your villa... And Yuri forces her to have an abortion. Why are you telling me this? Well, you tell your villa. What are you still doing? So what should he do? Today, it will go... I do not know... I just do not know... You do not say I told you about it. Anu thank you... Yes. If you want, you can go. But I will say that you and I will. This is a Villa will not be able to stop drinking. His father died of vodka and he also died. And a couple of years, he will die from cancer, and you stay alone, because in our house you will not live.

At the end of a long driveway - Small World And its top I can not see But my little life here - one. here all my pain and my last home... Where's Kurt? I asked where Kurt? Where it is probably better... - Oh, my God! What happened? She's alive, do not worry. Mom, you promised. So I believe that one day can see the top of the sky. And when I get big... Damn! I do not need to be any stronger, Neither beautiful and just listen to yourself, Because my heart wants to heat when it beats inside ask, you, the Creator, believe me. I thought it would be good if I had time to see it. Since I live as best I can, sky above me... So I believe that one day can see the top of the sky. And when the beauty of the world all will go down with me, That itself I'll barefoot stand before love... Russian Translator Lyudmila Reimann
