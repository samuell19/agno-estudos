When do you stop looking at each other? Shouldn't there be a warning? Shouldn't somebody say to us, “Hey, watch out. Pay attention. “ Because you can be thinking, “I'm okay. We're okay. We're good. “ Then you turn around and the distance between you... We've got a little job for you. I certainly am. - The Speed Merchants. - I'm sorry. My fault. It's traffic. Yeah, bad traffic for three days, Mac. That's mine. - Hi, Bea. - Hi, Dad. Late, but very exciting. There are more bags. - Okay, Bea? - No, I want it. - Stop with the balloon. No. Stop. Stop. - I want... - Who's that? - That's one of the cleaners. - Yeah? - It's the cleaner, yeah. Yeah. You know her, Erika. She's staggering. Staggering. Why have you got a picture of one of the cleaners on your computer? I was just experimenting with my camera. I was just, you know... "Can I just... Oh, that's good." Come on. It's all right for you, mate. You got a gorgeous Swedish wife. Girlfriend. Half Swedish. You cannot say "girlfriend" after 10 years. You all right? I mean, is that true? You've been there. Are you gassed in Sweden if you're ugly? Or maybe just given a penis? Because some of the men can be very ugly, but I have never seen an ugly Swedish woman. Jesus, look at Liv. I love this space. We do. We think it's a steal. Thanks for coming. That's us. Let's go. - Are we crazy? - No. - About what? - King's Cross. Sandy still thinks we're crazy to move there. It's so... The area. It's a great office, isn't it? And it was a... It's a great project. It was a great night. I don't know. It's all great. Thank you for making an effort tonight at the launch. I know it's not your... But it really helps. It's okay. It's fine. - Was it an effort? - What? - That's her. That's Bea. - No, that's a fox. - No, it's her. I... She was exhausted. - They're taking over London. I hate that noise. It's so late. How can she just not sleep? I don't think going to her always... I don't know if that helps. I know you don't. - Let's go back and see someone. - I've seen too many someones. Sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, what you're doing, the whole project for London, the office, everything, it's wonderful. - I think it can genuinely be something... - Rubbish. - Genuinely... - Terrible. - ...rubbish-like. - Crap. I'll come back. Down. Hold. And one, two... Up. Down. One, two, three. Bea, darling, it's 3:30 in the morning. We have to stop this. Hello? Yeah. Well, no. I mean, I'm his partner, so... Yes, I am. What? Hi. Officer, this place is my business, so... All right. Go on, then. - My partner's in there already. - Okay. I had everything on that laptop. My life is on that laptop. - I'm very sorry, sir. - Will? Will? All the computers. My laptop. The petty cash. - Well, how did they get in? - Through the roof. - What about the alarm? - Turned it off. Well, how did they know the codes, Will? - Listen, I wasn't here. I don't know. - Jesus Christ. - You have cleaners? - It's not the cleaners. - This is covered in glass. - It's not the cleaners. I know it's... I know the cleaners. How can we have a break-in on our first day? Unless the cleaners have turned into a bunch of acrobats. - Who is it? - Zoran and Miro. Hello. - Hey. - Hey. How's my best nephew? See my hands. See his. His dad had the big brains. I had the big hands. Your dad had hands like a girl's, and the girls loved him. It's the same with you, too. My son is the clumsy one. This is for you. Wipe everything. You know how to do that? Erase everything? They'll be delivering new computers, and then you can go back in, my little monkey. Hi, Mum. It was okay. - Lots of homework? - No, not really. Not really? Mirsade, you not been at school for weeks. They sent another letter. It's a mistake. Half the time they don't know who's there and who's not there. Now we have to go back to see people at the social services. We survived. Do you understand? - We survived, and that's not free. - I didn't ask to survive. Imagine your father. If we could offer him just one day, one hour. Imagine! I don't even remember him. I don't remember him. Where do you go? Where do you go every day? - I'm working. I'm earning money. - You have to go to school. That's what we promised, with police and the court. - Otherwise, they'll put you in prison. - I'll be 16 in 3 months. Mirsade, you're clever boy. I have to go. I'm late. If somebody... If one of this family... If any of our people are leading you... I'm telling you, if any one of them is, I'll kill them! And I wouldn't care! I mean, we've never really had a proper diagnosis, but I've always known Bea was special. Yes! She's double happy, double sad, double excited, double awake, double needy. Well, no, triple needy, actually. I know, even... Even when Bea was 10 months old, she was already distressed by noise. She would only sleep with a particular blanket next to her or eat with a particular spoon. And, just lately, it's been getting worse, and she can't sleep at all. She can't manage at school. We're, all of us, just completely at our wit's end. I can't. I'm sorry, I'm late. I'm late! I've got to go. I've got to go. Wei Ping, just make sure they don't move anything any more in this area. I've got to go. - ...eat foods of a certain colour. - Sorry. Sorry. - I'm Rosemary McCloud. - Hi, Rosemary. I'm Will. - Where's Bea? - Oh, no, Bea... No, the structure is that, before I begin any sort of diagnosis, I like to meet the parents first, alone. Right. Great. So I'm just finishing with Liv. Well, I'd like to listen to these documentaries. - I must've heard them in the past. - No, they're mostly World Service. Liv explained that she's gone into semi-retirement until Bea gets... - That's not true. - Effectively. Will. It's either Bea's gymnastics, Bea's art therapy, Bea's music therapy... It's a sacrifice, is all I'm saying. Liv won prizes for the work she did. Did she tell you that? It's a big sacrifice, is all I'm saying. - I was just explaining to Rosemary... - She's up all night. ...that in these past few months, that Bea's gotten worse. Yeah. And she's not sleeping and it's intense. Yes. Have either of you, you know, therapy... Have either of you considered... Ever thought about doing that or... - I did see someone. - When? For a while, 'cause I can get low. Sometimes I just go into low. Wow. My father died, my mother died and my sister died and... It's family with a short life expectancy, I think. - And a grandmother of 93. - And a grandmother of 93. But some days the cup is empty and some days it's 93% full. Were you... Were you brought up in Sweden or... - My father was American. - Right. And I went to university there. Chicago. Addicted to cold. No. Are you concerned about Bea? Sure, you know, but Liv is... Liv worries so much, there's not much room for... You know, but a 13-year-old girl who collects batteries, doesn't sleep, doesn't let us sleep, won't eat anything, spends all day wanting to do somersaults. I mean, yeah, sure, I'm concerned. Of course I'm concerned. Liv says that you're wrapped up in your work. - "Wrapped up." "Wrapped up"? - That's fair. I love how working hard, working really hard, becomes "wrapped up", becomes something selfish. I love that. When you say that you love it, do you mean that you don't love it? Let's just back up. We love Bea. It's not a competition to see who loves her the most. If it were a competition, I would happily let Liv win. You win. And turn. Says here your father died, your husband, your sister. This was where, Sarajevo? Miro and I left with the Red Cross. My husband stayed behind and was... He stayed behind and was murdered. You're Serbs? My husband was Serb. I'm Muslim. It's complicated. We're Bosnian. We're all Bosnian. It's complicated. You have relatives in Britain? My husband's family. His brother, sisters and aunt. There was a time when a smack round the ear or a... My auntie would give me a thump. Matter of fact, she punctured my eardrum at one point. But you knew where you were. Simple. We're all simple. What about you, sonny Jim? What've you been up to while you've not been at school? Back thieving? Stealing again? You see, things are not things. Things are always somebody's things. A car is Jack's car, 'cause he worked for it. Your Prada jacket is little Kevin's Prada jacket. Before it was his, 'cause I can see your little brain ticking over, his Prada jacket belonged to Mr Prada. - What about before that? - Before what? Before it was Mr Prada's, did it belong to the woman who made it? 'Cause my mum does that. Makes clothes for other people. Slaves for other people. Or like when prisoners make trainers. Next time you're going down. We'll catch you, and then you can discuss the wonders of trainers with your cellmates. Back in a minute. Sorry I'm late again, but everything is here. - All the Macs, everything. - It's okay. Excellent. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Excuse me? You dropped this. - Thanks, Erika. Please come up, Erika. It is Erika, isn't it? - Yes, sir. - Sandy. We set the alarm, sir. I did it myself. You have my word. Hold on. I'm not accusing you. The police have already called my mobile phone, asking me questions. - Yeah, that is normal. - About this thing and that thing. - I'm so sorry. - It was like Kafka. "Where did you get your car? Why are you ordering takeaway?" - You know, we try to do a good job, sir. - And you do. You do, do a very good job. Erika, listen. We have to have a new code for the alarm. Now, we're gonna give you your own code. You're gonna choose it, not us, so there's absolutely no way of you being wrongly accused of anything. - Is that a deal? - Okay, thanks. Listen, I had your picture on my computer. - What would the burglar make of that? - My photograph? Yeah, well, from when I was trying my camera out, if you remember. So the burglar, someone who didn't know the context, would think you were a friend or a girlfriend. I mean, someone standing over there, who couldn't hear us, what would he make of this? - Apart from my uniform. - Of course, apart from the uniform. Yeah, but say if we were too far away to see the uniform... You know. And I could give you this book and, you know, for all matey-boy over there knows, that's the collected works - of Franz Kafka. That's your birthday... - Or the Bible. Or the Bible. - The model hasn't changed. - You can't take a fish out of water, though. Why isn't she moving? Of course I know. Because we'd have to plan... - You can't take the fish out of water. - Not one email, mate. Fifty emails. - I know that, but it was stolen. - Why isn't she moving? - She's dead. - You can't take a fish out of water. - Okay, put her down. - Darling, listen to Mummy. - No, you can't take a fish out of water. - Oh, no, don't put it back in. You can't take a fish out of water! She needs... She needs water. - Sandy? No, I can't get to the office. - She needs water. If you can get to the office for me... - Well, I can't because I'm needed here. - You're right. You can't take a fish out. - If you could do that for me, mate. - You can't. But she's dead, see? - You can go? Okay, that's great. - It's okay. We'll bury her. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna put her in a little box. - Oh, don't cry, darling. - Can't take a fish out of water. Don't cry. Come on, we're gonna put her in a box... I have to pick a new code. 2178. It's my date of birth. Please, Lulu, don't tell no one. They think I'm younger. Now what you doing? Let's go! Leave it! Leave it! Get the doors! Jesus Christ! Fucking hell! This is brilliant. You really gonna do all this? I mean, put a canal right through the middle? Yeah. It's brilliant. I'm Bruno Feller, CID. Are you Sandy or Will? - I'm Will. - Hello, Will. - Hi. - You know what? I was born right there. Just about there. - I'd have drowned. - Yeah. I love it. I think it's really nice. - This is Sandy Hoffman. My partner. - Sandy. - Hello. - Detective Bruno Feller, CID. - Hi, Bruno. - I was just saying this is - a fabulous building. I think it's brilliant. - Thank you. Was it you who had the scrape with the villains? No, I wouldn't say it was a scrape, although they scraped my car. No, I was running late for the first break-in. - I wasn't quite prepared for the second. - Well, I get it completely. You know, I completely get it. You know... You're disgruntled. I would be, you know? Putting all that effort into making such a fabulous building, you know, in a hostile community. You know, you don't need the grief, do you? Well, it's no fun, Bruno. You know, financially, it's a disaster. The insurance is gonna be through the roof. You know your problem, Sandy? - What's my problem? - King's Cross is what? What is it? I mean, that's you, there. You got the British Library over there with Eurostar, and bang in the middle you got crack village, with a load of Somalians walking about with machetes. It's an area in flux. They left a computer disc, the burglars. Did you know that? With my photographs. - What do you mean? Where? - No, sorry, they returned it. More than that. They downloaded my personal photographs off my laptop, that they stole the first time, and they brought it back. - Well, can we see it? - Yeah. Lovely. - So, they've got compassion. - Well, I wouldn't go that far. Well, I'm not saying you got to show them compassion. You know, you're just like my girlfriend. My ex-girlfriend. "They're the criminals. They're the bad guys." Can I have a go? Don't you just love a Mac? Sweet, eh? And what do you say to your girlfriend? I'm the old bill, Will. You know, I've been on the beat, undercover, in a suit. You know, it's the law. It's Einstein's law of relativity. What does that mean, exactly? Sorry, relativity? Well, relatively speaking, if me and Sandy, here, break the law, you know, we're gonna get a decent lawyer. Now, these guys who broke in here, they'll go straight to jail. Do not pass go. Yeah. One law for us, one for them. - Except we haven't broken the law. - Everyone's broken the law. Our vision for King's Cross, for the public spaces of King's Cross, starts with the premise that we acknowledge an urban landscape is a built landscape. Starts as an argument with society's phoney love affair with nature. We are against the mistaking of grass for nature, of green for nature. King's Cross is an area of North London associated with poverty, crime, vice and urban decay. Ourjob is to transform the landscape, not decorate it with green. Because how we feel about ourselves, how we behave, is directly affected by the space around us. How we design the outdoors of our city is as important as how we design the indoors. We're going to take the canal and use it like calligraphy, like ink, to write around the development. - We think it's the cleaners. - What about the cleaners? - Breaking in. - They don't even clean properly. It's true. They don't. They never empty the dishwasher, or load it, for that matter. They bring their kids, their boyfriends. - Come on. - They do. And, to be honest, Will, it's getting a little traumatic. I'm staying late at the office and worrying that the place is gonna be ransacked while I'm in it. Look, they're cleaners and they're not clean. Okay. Good. Thanks. Thanks for the tea. Thanks for the theory. No, wait. I'm sorry, but what does that mean? It means your boyfriend's been to the office, Ruby. And yours, Wei Ping. And yours, actually, Joe. So where do the rules say we can have boyfriends but the cleaners can't? Or kids? And explain this to me, please. How are the cleaners getting up onto the roof, then swinging through the roof light, and why they are, when they've already got keys and codes? - All right. - Hi. I've just been trying to defend our cleaners. Well, I've just spoken to the alarm company. Whoever broke in used the cleaners' code. What do we actually do if we see a burglar? Call the police? Kill them? There's a weird ecology, of course, to these break-ins. The new computers, they're upgrades, you know. They're new models. You could argue they'll break in every, say, six months. - Good business, isn't it? - Just not every six days. Exactly. I wish someone would steal this car, for instance. 42,000 miles. I've got the criminal mind. Lots of wanting to be bad. See an ass, want to bite it. I just never do. Good. Good. But what you've done there is you've strayed from the moral to the criminal. You crossed the moral/criminal divide. Wanting to bite an ass is a moral issue, and then only if the ass belongs to someone who objects to the idea. Criminal would be biting the ass without permission. - You're such a lawyer. - Yeah. - Anyway, then what? - "Then what," what? You bite the ass, then what? Well, then they bite yours. It's a theory. It's been so long since I've bitten or been bit. It's good to talk, though, mate. The problem is, you find out we're all so miserable. Hello, hello. Erika, open the door. - He doesn't look happy. - Do you recognise him? No. I don't know. God, I wish I could lip-read. Hang on. I think I can. "I don't like you any more. "I like Sandy. He's everything I want in a man. "And stop burgling his bloody office." God. - Hello. - Got a light? - We don't smoke, sorry. - But there is a car lighter. All right. - So, is it? - Of course it is. - I don't believe it. - Okay. I've got nothing on under my coat. Well, this might warm you up. Christ. Oh, God. Okay? Have a good night. - Oh, Christ. - Can I get inside? It's cold. Sorry. Hey! Come on, this is a car, it's not a community centre. Jesus Christ. Hey, come on. So, what are you guys looking for? Oh, fuck. Fuck. - Are you spying on us? - Not at all. - No. - Who's this? It's insulting. - No, well, no insult intended. - Seriously, we're not... - You do not trust us. - This your girlfriend? - No, she's not my girlfriend. - Trust? If you have to say it, it means there is none. Use a condom. That's my answer to trust. "Sure, I trust you. Use a condom." One minute you're nice to me, the next you're spying on me. No. Erika. Erika, listen. Erika! Please. Please. Can you just listen? Please, just listen. £50. Whatever you want. - What's your name? - Except talk. - What if I wanna talk? - Call the Samaritans. Humans. - We talk. Why? - I don't know. Animals don't talk, because they don't lie. Erika! This was a ridiculous idea. That was good. You really helped. We should... We need... We need to lock up. - You work here? - Yeah. - Yes. - Bad place for an office. What's your project about? I don't really know. A place I'd like to live in, - or run through. - I would love to jump, you know? To jump from building to building. - Is it amazing? - But what? No buts. Is that amazing? - Yeah. - But dangerous. - No buts. - You see the city. What is it like? Better. Did my dad just not want to come with us? He... He loved you, but he was engineer. He was needed. Every bridge was blown up, so, anyway... It's more complicated. No story from Sarajevo is simple. - There's no bread. - No bread, no butter, no flour, no dairy. - Nor last night. You didn't notice? - I did. We're trying a diet. - How's the chicken? - Chicken's good. - Good. - Ice cream's dairy. Ice cream is dairy. - That's right. Sweetie, try the chicken. - Try the chicken first. This is a diet just for you. Bea, put those things back now. Have some chicken. - Rosemary suggested we try this. - Where is it? - Remember her? Therapist Rosemary. - Where is it? What have you done with the ice cream? There's amazing stuff about the effect of food on mood - and the brain. - Rosemary. - I chose it! - She said that? - Wow. - It's not fair! Every time I say something in this house, - it gets repeated back as a question. - You know I like ice cream. I say "good morning," people ask me what makes me think - it's a good morning. - What? No ice cream. I'm trying to hold this family together, all right? - There's no ice cream, Mama. - Who are people? Who are these mysterious people? I feel a fool with my SunBox, I do, but it's the only sun you can rely on in this house. No, Liv. Hey, Liv, come on. What are you talking about? I want the ice cream. Why have you taken it away? - I only wanted a slice of bread. - Why have you taken it away? You know what? Can we just try this? Can we try this as a family, please? Just as a family, for a week? Don't say "try together" if we don't decide together. Well, don't say "decide together" if we don't cook together, or talk together, - or do anything together. - Don't do anything together? - There we are. - "There we are," what? - Exercise. Exercise. - Come, stop now. - "There we are," what? - You don't even hear it, Will. - You don't even hear it. - Exercise. Exercise. - Eat your chicken first! - No! - Will, stop yelling. - Chicken? I'm a vegetarian! - Stop yelling at her. - Eating chicken is disgusting! - You don't eat vegetables. - It's disgusting! Excuse me. Will you stop? Sweetheart, listen to us. You don't even care if she eats her bloody vegetables. - You eat sugar, you get hyper. - No, it's disgusting! - That's why we're not doing sugar. - No! Leave me alone! Now, what we know is if we smash things and we scream and we shout, we get our own way. That's what we know. Or run away! Great. Great. That's great. Liv? Liv, darling. Liv! Or we just say nothing, because God forbid we ever... We ever say what we actually meant! No, just let the shutter come down! Anyway, I really have to get back to the office. Bea? My car keys. Where's the battery? Bea. Hey, I need the battery. Don't... We're human. Don't punish us. - We get fed up. - Fed up? Is that about the diet? No, it means "upset". I don't know why. It's a metaphor. Remember, we spoke about those. "Cried your eyes out" doesn't mean your eyeballs fall out. Metaphors. Fed up. It's nothing to do with food. - Where's my battery, Bea? - It's in my box. - Where's your box? - It's my box. You can't go in my box. - Well, you go get the battery. - Bea? - It's all right, we're working it out. - Bea, go and get Will's battery. - "Will's battery"? - Can you explain to me why you suddenly need to go to the office every night? - You know why. - You're not the police. And the police are not night watchmen. Nor are you. Most wives would worry if their husbands went cruising - in King's Cross every night. - Come on. Hire a security company, Will. Most wives are married to their husbands, as we're being so accurate tonight. Dads, wives, "Will's battery." Thanks for that. Don't think I see the real father around much. I love your SunBox, whatever the fuck it's supposed to do. I keep hoping it'll warm you up. - Skinny cap, extra shot, right? - Great. Thanks. - I brought a CD. - I got some CDs. - No, for dancing. I like to dance. - In cars? Inside, outside, upside down. I can dance on your lap, but it's not for free. Absolutely. I still make you come, but not inside me. Some guys think that's not cheating. I need a man To bring me love To make me sing I sing I need a man To make me feel Like I'm a queen That's good. You are. You're very good. You're great. - That's okay. It's fine. - What do you mean? It's okay. Hi. I'm sorry. You smell of perfume. - Well, I don't know how I do. - Nor do I. - I love you. - Is that an answer? It's the truth. What do you need? What do you want, ever? I feel as if I'm tapping on a window. You're somewhere behind the glass, but you can't hear me, even when you're angry, like now. It's like someone a long, long way away is angry with me. Well, glass is better than ice, which is where we were earlier. Sweden, ice, depression, the high rate of suicide. I never got close to anybody who didn't want to talk about that. - Or free love. - Liv Ullmann. Liv Ullmann. Who's Norwegian, by the way. Wait, there are no other Swedes to talk about. Nobody lives there. You could drive for hours before you pass another Volvo. Abba. But, let's face it, it's a sad old list. What about the English? You brought us, what, sarcasm? And the Beatles. Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah Knowing me, knowing you - Lager louts. - No, you invented lager. - Excuse me, the Danes. - Yeah, same difference. No, no, no. I love your laugh. I love your laugh. I'd like to gather up all your laughs and lock them in a box, like Bea's, and nobody would be allowed the key. - Where are you going? - To shower. Or to kill that fucking fox. Come back here. - Mama? - I'll take you. I'm taking you. Mum takes me. - Oh, no. No, it's okay. It's okay. - I'm taking Bea. I want to. - Go back to sleep. - Mum takes me. Daddy will take you today. - It's fine. It's fine. - See, I'm up. Okay. Seat belt, Bea. - What's that? Is that a CD? - Yeah, it's... Yes, it's a CD. - Is it yours? - No... Yes. Shut up. "Shut up" is good, isn't it? Excellent. I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it! Watch, I'll show you again. Okay? Paul! Paul, are you ready? Are you ready? And now... Sweetie, you're still wet. You're dripping. - Yellow towel. - It's not yellow. Is it yellow? Yellow stitching. - You have to dry yourself. - I did. I used the hair dryer. Well, how about my sweater? It's kind of a towel. Is it a good colour? It's a good colour, and it's a sort of towel. But you'll be cold. No, if I get cold, I'll wear the towel. Bea, look, those guys. They're amazing. - I want a lesson. - Come on. Mum, you okay? Are you okay? - You're soaked. - Excuse me? - We would like to donate our towel. - No, I'm fine. Thanks. - Really. We hate our towel. - We hate our towel. - We do. We hate it. - Yeah, it's looking for a new home. - Thank you. - We hate our towel. Come on, lovely. That was good. You should join the circus. Get off me. - It's cold. - Yeah, it's a bit cold. - Well, why wind down the window? - Get some air. - Why? - You know, quite a strong perfume. - It's my job. - Actually, I got you a present. In return for the CD, the coffees... It's good, I think. My wife uses it. She says it's good. That's fucked up. What man wants to be with a girl that smells like his wife? No, no. I didn't say I wanted to be with a girl. You think I like to smell like this? You think I like to wear panties which cut my pussy in half? - I didn't mention your... - Men are incredible! Thank you. So, what? You clean this area up, is that the plan? Not exactly. If you work with nature, why are you so against nature? Well, A, I'm not. And, B, I'm absolutely not. - The fox in your garden. - What about the fox in my garden? The one wild thing in your life and it makes you crazy. You know, turn the whole world into a park. - That's not what we do. - Like Disneyland. With flowers. That's ironic, because that's the opposite of what we do. Go ahead, clean up, because we will move to another alley, - and we'll take the foxes with us. - Good. Because this is the human heart. This is the world. It's light and dark. They're putting fortune cookies in with the crack now, are they? This is, what, the human heart? This is the world? This is shit. You're talking shit. - I have to charge you. - Huh? No, I have to charge you. You crossed the line. - What do you mean? - We have chitchat, it's free. I keep warm, I buy coffee. It's a trade. - You abuse me, that's business. - How did I abuse you? Men abuse me, I get paid. £50. No way am I giving you £50. - £50! - I'm not giving you £50. - £50! - No. Fuck! - He's like a monkey. - I'm gonna call the police. What? To say what? To say, well, there's a man breaking into my building! It's not a man, it's a boy. I've got a special thing, a code. - Four, three... Oh, no, I'm Hoff... - No police. Yes, I'm Hoff... Ah, well, my partner's Hoffman. Well, where am I? I'm in my car! I'm looking at him! I'm... Four... Hey! Hey! Come here! Bloody hell. Hey! We're getting out of here. - What about Miro? - What about Miro? - What happened to your hand? - Forgot my keys. You're bleeding. No. I didn't fall, Mum. Why can't you do it? You're a tailor. Dad! Dad! - Dad! - I'm too old to chase robbers. - Dad. Dad. - All right. Hey. - Hey. What are you crying about? - Dad. Will, where the hell have you been? We've been worried sick. Hey, why's Mummy crying? Why aren't you in bed? I could've caught him. I nearly caught him. The police weren't gonna get here, so I followed him. - I mean, I imagine... He's just a boy. - We were so... What did the police do with my car? The police? They were here for probably about a minute. So, what are you telling me? Somebody's stolen my car? - My bag's in there. The wallet. - Jesus Christ, Will. - My keys. - You left the car open? Yeah. Well, I was chasing a thief, Liv. Did you get a look at this boy? No, not really. Hey. Hey. It's okay. Reminds me of when I first met you. Driving around, trying to get her to sleep in the back. You in your nightgown. Remember? So beautiful. Will, a boy can still stab, you know. What if you'd caught up with him? I don't know. Anyway, he's not gonna come back. It's probably all over now. Zoran. Zoran, watch. Not bad. Hey, did you see that? - Did you see that? I just landed it. - Yeah, yeah. Nice. You're in the wrong place, mate. I telephoned earlier about my jacket. Yes. This is strange. You probably don't remember. We bumped into each other the other day at the sports centre. - We gave you our towel. - That's right. So, I've torn my jacket. I can't repair that. Well, I can, but... You'd only see the tear... I don't think... The cost, I don't think, is worth to do it. Really? It's a favourite. I'd hate to throw it away. I can try. Come back Friday. Great. Friday. Good. I'll see you on Friday. Friday. Excuse me! Excuse me! Your wallet. It was in your jacket. Thank you. It's new. I already lost one wallet this week. Thank you. I'm... I was rude. I'm sorry. This city, you know. See someone in one place and then another, makes you very... Sure. - I have to get back. - All right. Can you if... If I brought a suit, can... I lost some weight. If I brought it tomorrow, say? I'm out tomorrow. - Friday, then? - Okay. Okay. Thank you for this. Will, she's asleep. It's a miracle. - I can't believe it. - That's great. Are you trying on suits? - Nothing really fits me. - It looks fine. Can I say "Rosemary says"? - Absolutely. What does Rosemary say? - She says... You know, it's... Bea says, "I need." I say, "I'm here." She says, "I need." I say, "I'm here." I'm not talking about going to work tomorrow, I'm just thinking about going back to work. Good. And start thinking about you. About us. Bea can come with me sometimes. She can dig, make a mess. No, that's great, but you're busy and distracted... And? Go on. And she's not my daughter. And right now, when she's such a... She's so... You can't trust me to take care of her. If you were measuring how far away from where we need to be, you and me, is that a long way? I don't think you can ask a question like that. It's not... Put on a suit, sound like a suit. Feels a long, long way, right now, from where it needs to be. I wish we could unsay and unhurt back to wherever that is, and start again. And how far back? I remember you bit me. You were angry with me and you bit me. Don't remember why. I don't know why either, but I remember I bit you. You really bit me. And I thought we were very close. We were. Yeah, but that's just teeth. It's not invisible, but... Well, that's amazing. Astonishing. Great. - Shall I put that on? - Yes. - Is there somewhere... - Yeah, my son's room's just there. - Is he in? - No, no, no. He's at school. Your son, is he studying to be an architect? No, he's only 15. It's a school project. I'm an architect of sorts. Funny. Your son's project... We use those figures. They're scale figures. They're from Japan. Hard to find in London. He must get them from school. Your trousers. You have children? - Oh, you were with a little girl. - My daughter. I remember her. This will take a week at least. - I'll have to remove the lining. - That's fine. I'll write you a bill for the jacket. - Should I just write "repairs"? - Yeah. What's this? Practise keyboard. No space for piano up here. You could play electric or electronic keyboard. No, I'm happy with this. You know, I imagine. You know. So... Not a good place to make noises. You could always use headphones. I'm fixing this, and I should mind my own business. People like me, from my country, we... I'm Bosnian. We think it's dangerous not to be able to hear. Tell your son, if he's interested, he can come and see our office. You know, to look around. We're very close. King's Cross. I might do that. Will Francis is your name? She'll never be his daughter. You wish Bea was Will's daughter? Is that it? I wish she was. I wish she was. Then maybe we could all be happy. I don't want to be cold. I don't want to be sad. I don't want to be angry with him any more. - I have this light box. - What kind of light box? For depression, a doctor prescribed it, and I sit in front of it for hours. It's supposed to stop me from getting down. Give me an image of that change that you hope for in Will. He's looking at me. - Sugar? - No, thank you. I think you'll want sugar. Okay. Are you unhappy? What makes you say that? You always seem, when you come here. I don't know. I'm happy enough. "Happy enough"? So English. I think it was the happiest day, really, when Bea was born. And then, sometimes I think... Sometimes I think Bea was punished because I left my husband and I left Sweden. And then I met Will, and he was kind. And we were happy. We really were. But then I just push him away. I don't know why. I just push him away from me. This is gonna sound really stupid. I forgot the shirt. I was gonna bring a shirt for you to copy, and I forgot it. - All right. - Shall I go back and get it? I can go back and get it now. - And I'd be like two seconds. - Okay. Or perhaps when you come for the suit? It's a bad time. You mean without the shirt? Right. But that doesn't make any sense, does it? I'm going to the supermarket - and I have to go to work. - Right. Okay. - How do you get the shopping home? - Bus. I'm practically driving a bus. My car's stolen, so I have a company van. It's electric. You could probably walk faster. Pedestrians will overtake us. Say yes. What's the worst thing that could happen? - Yes. - Okay. - Tell me about your son. - Mirsade? Mirsade. It's... He hates his name. But it was a name for Sarajevo, not for London. Now his name's Miro. But I think he should love his name. You know, names in my country, they're like flags. You can live or die because of your name. Mirsade, it's a Muslim name. It should be Serbian, because of his father, but, you know, I can be stubborn sometimes. - You what? - Stubborn sometimes. But that name saved his life. When we were getting out of Sarajevo, we came out with Red Cross, leaving the siege. The guards, the Serbs, stopped us at one of the checkpoints and they took him. They took my son and they said, "What's your name?" And he said, "Mirsade. My name is Mirsade." His Muslim name. If he told his family name, the Serbian name, Simic, they might have taken him as a son of a traitor. Anyway, since then, I don't think he's ever really... He gets in trouble. That's another story. I can't talk about siege in supermarket. Sorry. We had a break-in. Several, actually, at our office. Something gets smashed. I mean, not just the windows. But not all breaking's bad, is it? You know, I mean, you break habits. Maybe before you repair the window, you should smash a few more. That's all I do, you see, in my job. I tidy up. There's a mess between buildings, and we come in. Squeeze in bits of green like dressing. Lipstick. Very pretty. Anyway... That's a roundabout way of saying, the shape of your mouth, I could probably draw it by heart. - What are you thinking? - I was thinking... It was a roundabout way of saying you're married, which I know. And I was thinking Bosnian men would say less, but would want more. They love to talk. They love talk, believe me. But talk, for them, is politics. Women, for them, is not talk. That's crushing. I didn't mean it bad. She's going to be disappointed, but okay. - Paul, are you a dad? - Yeah, I love kids. I like to take the boys to cricket. My friend had to sort out his little kids. Here's Mum. Dad can't make it. - But here's what we're gonna do. - No. Why can't Dad come? It's okay. Look, sweet... Because he's working. - He can't make it in time. - He never comes. We have the videos. Video, video, video. Bea! - That stop there's very good. - I know. You noticed. - Again. Again. Again. - Again? - What do you think? She's great, eh? - Great. It's good, too, because the batteries are back in the remote. It's a mystery, how these batteries find their way home just when we need them. Big mystery. Oh, yes. Beautiful. That's lovely. Come on, Liv. Mystery two: How did you video this and be in the picture at the same time? Paul was cameraman. - Paul? - Bea's trainer. You've met him a hundred times. - Paul loves Mum. - No, Paul loves Bea. Amazing! But does Paul love me? If you could do anything right now, what would it be? - I have to work. I have to get back. - Oh, come on. - Anything. I don't know. - Come on. Change everything up until this moment? Not my son. Everything else. I can't do that for you. You didn't say, what could you do. "What would I do" is what you said, not what you could do. What could I do? Why? Why? I don't understand. I don't understand either. If I had a magic wand, I don't know... Persuade my son to come to Sarajevo with me? Start a new life? And you? If you could do anything right now, what would you do? - I'm sorry. Sorry. - I'm sorry. Hi. You waking up? - I've made burek. - I can smell them. It's hot. Careful. You're happy. Not so strange. Put on the telly. It might be on the news. You're not so big I can't sit on you. Miraka. We should go home this summer to Sarajevo. I think you would love it. Tanja says there are flights for a few pounds. Maybe. Maybe. Your grandmother would cry for weeks. Great. What's this? - I forgot. I put it in your room. - Where'd you get it? It's a customer. I sewed his jacket. He's an architect. He said you could go and look at his office. What's the matter? I have to go out. What did you say to him? What do you mean? - Did he go in my room? - No. Just to try some trousers. Why do people have to go into my room? Miro, he's a good person. He's a good man. He was just trying to help. You think everyone's good! No one's good! What are you... - What is it? - I'm in such shit! - She's taken back the laptop. - You what? - She's taken back the laptop. - That is so fucked up. She says they're friends. Yeah, but that's all that, "Hello, my son did it. Lock him up." She says she's gonna talk to him, do some sort of deal. Papa. Papa. - Will! - What? A lady looking for you! - What? - A lady is looking for you! All right. - You okay? - What is it you want from me? - Nothing. - Because you don't... - Well, I don't want anything. - ...just walk into someone's life and knock on their door and kiss them! - You cannot do that! - I know that. What? - What? What's the matter? - And using me to hurt someone else? - What, you mean Liv? - Promise me! - That's the last thing I want... - Promise me! Promise you what? What, promise you I'm not flirting? - I know what that is. - I don't believe you. - I know what that is... - I don't believe you. ...and this is not what... I can't talk any more. I wanna go somewhere and not talk. Not talk. I have a friend, she works. Maybe she would lend her place. - It's close to here, it... - Call her. - It's not hotel. It's not palace, but... - Call her. What's her number? - Yes, please. - When can I come home? The clothes on under my clothes, they're not... I've always wanted to make something in silk. I'm giving myself to you, and I want it to be worth something. Come here. - Hi. - Hi. I never met somebody when I was already in their bed. I'm Will. Thank you for... I'm Tanja. It's good to have a man in my bed. I hope it's contagious. I'll get my... “'Don't kill the boy, ' brave Benoit said. "But Dai replied, 'Why not? "'I come from the Isle of Wight. We eat young boys a lot.' "But secretly Dai had a heart. He kept it in a jar. "He hadn't seen that jar for years. He found it in his car." Great reading. That's not reading, that's knowing by heart. - There's a metaphor. - Where? "To know by heart." "'Forgive, forget and eat more jam,' the jar said on the lid. "Dai ate some jam and thought a lot, and in the end he did. "Go home and be a better boy, although sometimes it's tricky. "There is a moral to this tale. "Jam makes fingers sticky!" - Well done. - Sticky jam. Okay, my sweet. It is now time for you and Bunny to get some sleep. - I'm not a monkey. - Sure. - I don't want you in this house! - Yeah, sure, whatever. - Understand? - Yes. Mirsade. - Why didn't you give it back? - I will, I will. I'll take it back. I don't get it. He knows, doesn't he? Why doesn't he just tell the police? I don't get it. Will. Yeah. - You should come and see this. - What? Come and see. Just left here. Keys are inside. - What does that mean? - I don't know. Will, is there something going on with you? I don't know. Something's going on with me. Erika. Erika forgave me and, well... It's early doors, but, you know... You know... Lattes have been drunk. - That's great. - Yeah. Sandy, can we go somewhere? Can we drive somewhere now? - Will... - Anywhere? Don't tell me you're fooling around, okay? I'm just entering fidelity. Don't exit. - It's not about fooling around. - It's always about fooling around. Fucking hell. Will, I've... I've gotta... And so have you. Oi! Where do you think you're going? Get on the back. - I'm late for school. - Yeah. Two years late. Get on the back. You're in a lot of trouble, son. Put your helmet on. It makes you invisible. And don't stab me while I'm driving, you'll fall off. Everybody's chasing round looking for evidence, fingerprints, DNA. I just look at the buildings and I know it's you. I know. Someone's doing very well, and you're not. I mean, what do you earn, a few quid? Pair of trainers? You're the bit you spit out to your friends, whoever they are. And I know who they are. They're not your friends. How long are we staying? She's lovely. They should tip London on its side and let a few million people slide right off, you see? There's no air. There's no air in a cell. None. And that's where you're going, no question. And that's a tragedy. Which of us is lying the most? About what? It's not even the right question. Which of us is lying to themselves the most? - About? - About this. I'm not lying. I have a photograph. - What photograph? - Of us. It's incriminating. Is this the right word? I don't know if it's the right word unless I know what you're talking about. It took me a little while to make sense of the jacket. You suddenly appearing at my door. That you'd been following my son. You must know about mothers, do anything to protect their children. Why would you take a photograph? Was that when your friend came back? - Why would you do that? - Why would you do this? You steal someone's heart, that's a real crime. And then what? - You call the police? - No. I don't know. No. Do you know how long... Do you know how long since anybody touch me? I should have told you, I know. I should have said something. It wasn't a plan. It wasn't a plan. It was you. That's the truth. I have to get out. And so, what? You come to bed with me for what? A photograph? That's squalid. The water is cold. But what about... It doesn't make any sense. What about today? Now? Look, a lie... That's right. That's my... That's me. I lie. I lie. Can't we draw a line and say no more lies between us? No more lies. No, I have to ask you to lie. To continue to lie. I have to beg you not to report my son. That's what this is? A bribe? If you like. I'm not stopping. Old bill have been at our place. Says they're gonna try and charge my dad. You shouldn't be here. What if they followed you? Then what? So? There's nothing for them to find here, is there? They've been down the car wash as well, making out they got all this evidence. They've got nothing. Trust me, nothing. Zoran! My laptop! They'll find my laptop! Oi! - Up there! - Come on! - Get to the other end! - Come on! Come on! Don't do it! The little bastards are going to Eastern Avenue! Eastern Avenue! They're on their way! The towpath! Miro! - Head him off! Head him off! - Miro! Miro! Come on! We've got one of them! Head him off! I'm sorry. You're gonna be okay. Show Mummy she can go do her work, we can do ours. Yeah. Wei Ping, can you just... Number nine needs to go left. All right, take it back, please. - Yeah, way left. - We're gonna need to go all the way. To the very end. At least three feet to the left. Stop there. Stop there. Stop there. - The model's wrong. Number nine is. - No, the model's not wrong. - Way back! - Will? - Yeah? - Couple of colleagues of mine. This is Erin and Lorna. This is Mr Francis. - Hello. - Hello. It was a fair result all around on the burglary, and the DNA matched and we got most of your stolen goods back. Yeah, Sandy said he's a young boy? Yeah, he's 15. He's been in a lot of trouble. - You know, final warning. - He's going to prison. Well, if he gets convicted, he will, yes. He'll go to a youth detention centre. Is this your computer, Will? - It's got all your files on it. - Well, then, it must be. Great. Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep it, just until the case comes to court. Bea. Bea, no! - Wei Ping, could you just... - Bea. Bea! I'm okay. I'm fine. Darling, stay with Wei Ping. This is a hollow victory for us, isn't it, girls? It is, yeah. I mean, he's just a little runt who done all the dirty work. We can't make a case against the adults. They're the real villains. Yeah, it's hollow. Well, you may find it hollow. We find it whatever is the opposite of hollow. Of course. We understand. Because, actually, it's been like a siege, okay? We have felt under siege. And worse than that, innocent people have been wrongly... Our cleaners. You know, it's very degrading. It's because we know the boy. You know? I mean, there's nothing wrong with him. Nothing? He's a thief. That's what's wrong with him. - Well, there's no question. - Will, all this is about some courts... - It's not a court. - Conciliation court, right. Whereby if we go along to meet the boy... What is it? Explain. It's a Camden thing. He gets let off. Hurray. It's not a court. Me and Lorna, we work on the Youth Offenders Team and we encourage the offenders to face their victims. Right, so we go to the court, arrange to meet... Not a court. - Sorry. Whatever court it is. - Right. - And he might not go to prison. - Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The law is a mess. Look, he's a boy. The last thing he needs is prison. You know, he's a Bosnian boy, and his mum, well... They're refugees, and his mum's in pieces. Mr Francis, what do you think? You've been very quiet. I just want to draw a line under the whole thing. - Bea! Bea! - Quick! - Somebody call an ambulance! - Oh, my God. - Get an ambulance! - I'm sorry! - I don't believe it! - All right, don't move her. - Is she moving? - All right. I'm here. I'm here. Try not to move. It's really, really serious. Try not to move. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi, sweet. My fibula's broken. Two places. And they have to put wires in to fix it. The doctor said... She said what? She said that I'd be up and climbing again in no time. We've got an X-ray. - If you want to see... - Definitely. - Sorry. - Sweetie, don't be sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorriest. - Daddy cried. - I did not. I laughed on the wrong side of my face. - Is it hurting? - It did. We had painkillers. Bea had two, Daddy had four. - You did not. - So, listen, Mummy's gonna stay. Okay? And I brought everything. I brought Stuffy. This hospital's very peculiar. They don't understand colour, do they? - Tried to put us in a yellow room. - I need to speak to Mummy. - Mummy's here. - I need to speak to Mummy by myself. Will. Okay. You have four new messages. Hello, Will, it's Amira. I need to see you. Call me. Thank you. Hello, Will, it's Amira. I'm sorry. Well, first of all, I want to give you this, which are the pictures. I wish they hadn't caught him. I wish I hadn't hurt you. - Truly. - Help me. Help him. I can't. This meeting with Miro and police... - I really can't. - If you came, it would... He'll go to prison. He's agreed, Miro. If you help him, he'll come back with me to Sarajevo. He won't say anything in court except he's sorry. I promise you. You're a good person. I know you. - Don't do that. Don't do that. - Please. - Don't do that. - Please. Amira, I can't. I can't do what you want. How can I? If I meet your son, it will come out that I know you, how I know you. - Please help me. - I can't help you. I can't help you. I can't. - Please. Please. - I can't. I'm sorry. Listen, I already tried to get him out of trouble. They've got too much evidence. - Please. Please. Please. Please. - I can't. I can't. - Please. Please, I beg you. I beg you. - I can't. - I beg you. - Amira, please, don't. I beg you. I beg you. Please. Please. - I can't, darling. I can't. I can't. - Help. Help. I was determined not to blame you, and I know it wasn't your fault. I know it wasn't, this afternoon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, it's me who should be saying sorry. I've been looking for love. Out there. I thought I might've found it. And did you? I think I might've lost the love I did have. The love of my life. Did I? Liv, I need to tell you everything. I need to tell you what I've done. - I thought you were going. - I can't go. I slept with her. It was hard enough to tell you that last night. That was bad enough without saying it in public, without hurting you twice. When you hurt this much, you can't be hurt twice. I was looking at you and I was thinking how long since I'd looked at you. I don't even know how to be honest. Maybe that's why I like metaphors. Because what I want to say is, there's a circle, yours and Bea's, and I'm not in it. But that's just to justify, because there's a part of me, so dark, sees that circle as a cage. - Thanks. - Will. - This is so great. - Good. Thank you. It's great. You know the idea of this. Just have to come in and we'll start. I'm sorry, this is... There's been a big mistake. - Mistake? - Yeah. Yeah, he... This boy's definitely not the burglar. I know him and I know his mother. What do you mean you know them? They came to our office. - They came to the office. - Well, how can that be? You were told the names, yet you never said you recognised them. I don't remember you saying the name Simic. You definitely didn't say Simic. Amira and I know each other. Actually, very well. And Miro's interested in architecture. - Mrs Simic? - He is, yes. No, I'm asking is it true that you and Mister... - Francis. - ...Francis know each other? Mr Francis is... I've done some work for him, adjusting a suit. I think this is... This is... Amira's being discreet. What do you mean, "discreet"? Amira's being discreet about the nature of our relationship, which was not an appropriate one, and I think she's trying to save me from embarrassment, from the embarrassment of myself and my family. And that's why she... That's why she's not saying she came to the office with Miro. I remember it, though. It was the day of the last burglary, and Miro cut his hand, and that's obviously where the... Well, that's where the DNA confusion occurred. - Mr... - Hoffman. Mr Hoffman, do you know anything about this? Nope. No, I can't say I do. Is this some... I mean, are we supposed to believe this? Actually, I've met both of them at the office. Yes. And I dressed the boy's cut, didn't I? Yeah. What? Hang on a minute. We recovered a computer, which you claimed had been stolen. Yeah, I lent... I lent Mrs Simic my laptop sometime when we were together. She takes photographs and I was showing her how to store them, what to do with them, how to delete them. I completely forgot. I was... I was confused. Sorry. I'm really sorry. What you did back there, you gave that boy back his life. Stop the car. What? Liv? What are you doing? You just don't get it, do you? - What? - God! We just go home, right? We just go home. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. - Liv. - Go. Go to Bosnia. - I can't hear you. - Go! - Get back in the car, Liv. - Just go. Go! Why were you looking for love? Ask yourself! Why? Why weren't you looking for me? Liv, get back in the car. No. I don't want you in the house! I don't want you in the house! For God's... God, you drive me out... You marry me, then! No, I don't want a husband! I want a good night's sleep! - No. Marry me. - No. - Marry me! I'm sorry! I want you back! - No! - Then win me back! - How? - I don't know! - How? What would I do? What do I do? - I don't know. - Because I'll do anything. I've been such an idiot. Just tell me what I have to do. I don't know! Look, I love you. I love you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Mirsade. - We never met, did we? I'm Will. - Hi. So, you're off to Sarajevo. You wanted to say something, right? - I just wanted to say that I was sorry. - Wait. Sandy? You got a minute? I just wanted to say that I was sorry, and thanks for what you did. You've given me another chance. Okay. Thanks for coming in. Thank you. This, I think, is the stuff my Mum mended for you. Tell her... Tell her thanks for mending stuff for me. I thought maybe your mother would come with you. Yeah, she was going to, but she's packing. Sure. Thank you. Do you understand... - I'm like the worst person... - I don't have something. - It looks nice. What is it? - I don't understand. I'm a technophobe. I have no way...
