NEWS ANCHOR 1 [ON TV]: Up next, the latest from the town of Slate River, which was rocked again last night by the brutal slaying of one of its own. NEWS ANCHOR 2 [ON TV]: I'm here on the campus of Slate River College, where the body of Laurie Glaser was discovered late last night by the school's janitor. Police are withholding all information as to the cause of death, but all fingers seem to point to the Slate River serial killer. Laurie Glaser would be his fifth known victim. Local authorities have promised the denizens of Slate River that the murderer will soon be apprehended. But till then, the unspoken fear is that the killer's four month reign of terror may well continue. Back to you, Paul. Here you go. Thanks. [music playing] [whistle] All right. Woo. [cheering] [whistle] [cheering] Yeah. [music playing] Go back. Woo. Woo hoo. [phone ringing] [cheering] [phone ringing] Hey, is somebody going to get that phone? What phone?

Maybe it's time we visit it again. Go fuck yourself. [hymn music] [music playing] [police siren] [chatter] Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, get in there. Get in there. Get in there. I want a shot. I want to see him right as he gets out of the car. Sheriff, can we get a statement from you? Sheriff. You're making the mistake of your life, Mr. Stone. You better hope so, Grubeck. Are you involved in the murders? Hold him. [chatter of questions] Jesus Christ, Stoney, that's-- I know who it is. Now, listen to me, Jody. When the wire services find out our prime suspect is the college dean, there's going to be reporters camped out from here to the interstate. I don't want anybody without a badge or an electoral vote inside this building. You understand me? Sheriff Stone-- Uh, what's an electoral vote? Jesus Christ, Taylor, look it up. - Sheriff-- - Sheriff-- - Wait, Sheriff-- - Sheriff Stone, come on. OK, folks. Show's over. Back up, now. Come on. [chatter] Come on, man. Come on. Come on. Get your hands off me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you tell it to the judge. Hey, Teddy. Robin, hi. Hello, you-- wow, ha ha, you look like a million bucks. Thanks, Jody. Hey, what's going on around here? It looks like somebody's invading. We caught the Slate River Killer. You're kidding. Who is it, Jody? I can't tell you that. It's top secret. Unless you want to go to the movies with me, ha ha. I'll I'll ask my dad. No, uh, no one in or out. Stoney's orders, sorry. Whatever, Jody. Hey, Jody. Your, uh, hm, fly's undone. [music playing] [whoosh] [screaming] [whoosh] Robin, Robin, Robin! Jody. Your dad will see you in his office now. You OK? Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine. That was weird. [ding] Mr. Grubeck? Robin, so nice to see you. [zooming sounds] [screaming] [music playing] Robin, Robin, easy, now. Easy now. You took quite a knock there, kiddo. [groaning] So how do you feel, slugger? Like a truck hit me. Huh, pretty close, a floor can pack quite a wallop. Here, drink this. So do you remember anything that happened out there? I think so. I was coming down the hallway to your office. I turned the corner, and-- Mr. Grubeck. Mr. Grubeck was there in handcuffs. [sigh] Yes, was, is, and will be for a very long time. What for? Robin, there is-- oh. There is evidence linking Mr. Grubeck to the death of Laurie Glaser, and maybe all of the Slate River killings. Mr. Grubeck, how could he be the Slate River Killer? There was a witness, Robin. Mr. Grubeck could be the killer. Easy now, easy now. I want you to take it easy. Relax. I just can't believe it, Dad. I used to work in his office. He-- he never did anything to me. He-- he never even raised his voice. I know, honey. It's a shock to all of us. Look, we've all been through a rough couple of months here. But now, thank God, we can all relax again. Hm? Come here. [music playing] TURRELL: You sure he can't see me? TAYLOR: Listen. I told you 100 times. He can't see you. - The hell he can't. Relax. Relax. - He saw me. Hey, listen. Calm down, slick. It's a two-way mirror. I don't give a damn what you call it. He just saw me. - Ah-- He looked right at me. Relax. All right, I've had it with this crap. Are you ready to make a statement? Yes, I am. The cuisine in this establishment tastes like second rate dog food. I hope you're taking this down, young man. Yeah, right. DETECTIVE: Yeah, that's very funny. Now you listen to me, Grubeck. We've got you down for first degree murder, and we've got a reliable witness. I take it you're talking about the drunk on the other side of that mirror. His word will stand up in court. I doubt if his legs would stand up in court. Now, as much as I'm enjoying this pleasant little chat, I believe my lawyer should be here. Don't you? Any way you want. Thank you. Dick. And detective, I do believe you owe me a phone call. Get him the phone. Stone, now. You sure as hell are going to need a miracle. And I don't think God owes you any favors. Maybe God is not the only one who works miracles, sure as hell. Three minutes. [music playing] [ringing] MASTER OF THE DARK [ON PHONE]: Out of the darkness and into the light comes your horrorscope on this dark and stormy night. Push 666 for your horrorscope now. Welcome to the caverns of the unknown. I am the Master of the Dark, the guide to your destiny on September 16. Your powers are strong, as is your will. But there may be another more powerful still. This wasn't supposed to happen. I obeyed you. I served you. I will continue to obey you. Are you going to answer me? I said-- are you going to answer me? Answer me! You will receive the power that you desire to fulfill your purpose and feed your fire. Prayers over, Grubeck. [zap] Ow! Damn, what is with you, Grubeck? They should lock him up and cut off his mouth. Harry said the police aren't letting anyone near the house. He's probably got bones and knives buried in the basement, like the one in Matamorris. Mhm. Anywhere you like, son, long as you've got cash. [chatter] COOK: Andy, order up. Come get it. ANDY: All right. Excuse me. What's the story with this place? What do you mean? Well, I mean, there's hardly anybody here. And in my vast experience, that's usually not a good sign. [laughs] Your vast experience? What are you, the easy rider or the galloping gourmet? Both. Here, try one. Mm, average, very average. Not nearly as tasty as the company. I'm Spike, Spike Jones. I'm Robin, Robin Jamison. I think you're causing quite a stir. Yeah, old habit of mine. [horn honk] Oh, my ride to the gym. Yeah, just when I was on a roll. Nice to meet you, Spike. Hey, you know, I could give you a ride on my bike. I'll take a raincheck. Where does everybody hang out around here? Down Down at the point. Maybe I'll see you. Bye. WAITRESS: Hey, guys. How are you? [music playing] MASTER OF THE DARK [VOICEOVER]: You'll receive the power that you desire to fulfill your needs and feed your fire. Ah! Ah! [music playing] [groaning] [music playing] So come have dinner with us. What's the big deal? - I know. Listen, I promised my dad I'd meet him later for dinner. Was he running another psychological profile or what? I just think he's a little worried about me. BOTH: He's always worried about you. Listen, there's something I've got to tell you guys this afternoon. Can you keep a secret? Of course. Depends. This morning at the police station, I saw Mr. Grubeck. You saw him? Yeah, I went to see my dad, and I ran right into him. Well, what did he look like? Did he have blood and guts all over him or what? Shut up, Keith. And then he, like, reached out and touched me. Ew, he touched you? Oh, what did it feel like? Like, like warm, or was it all cold and squishy? God, stop it. Ow. ROBIN'S FRIEND: Sorry, Robin, you'll have to excuse Mr. Sensitivity here. Look, Robin, I know how you felt about the guy. But he's just a creep. You know, he always was a creep. He's just some horny old pervert who hid in the Dean's Office, checking girls out through the crack of his door. You guys are bad. I gotta get going. I'll see you later, OK? - Bye-bye. - Bye. [music playing] [whoosh] [music playing] I've got to go. Yeah, later. Hey man, nice bike. Hey, I'm looking for a girl named Robin Jamison. She's over there. She's coming this way. Don't even think about it. No problem. Hey, Robin. Hey, easy rider. What are you doing here? Do you have a second? Sure. Your father is the one examining Steven Grubeck, right? I guess so. He usually doesn't talk to me about work, especially not now. Why is that? Well, you know Mr. Grubeck's the dean of my community college. Yeah, I know. I used to work in Mr. Grubeck's office part time. You know, everybody else thought he was kind of scary. But we always kind of got along. Do you recognize this? You left it at the diner. Yeah, it fell out of a magazine I was reading. Did you call the number? Me? No way. I hate this kind of stuff. It's a joke, right? No, Robin, it's no joke. What are you talking about? The horrorscope cards, somehow they get into the hands of people who are in some kind of trouble, who need help. And so they start calling this number, and the line gives them things, like answers to their questions, solutions to their problems. And so they keep calling the number, because all of a sudden, they got some sort of power that they never knew they had. [scoffs] You can't be serious. No, I am. I've tried it, and it works. And somehow, I got away. But this thing, it possesses you. And it starts to take you over and starts to take control. Spike, you're scaring me. Look, I know this sounds crazy. But I've seen things. I've had visions. Spike, those visions, I've had them too. And I saw him kill Laurie. And I'm afraid she's not going to be the last. Mhm, Ojo, and Manny, I also want $2 on Beatlebaum. Well, of course I got the money. I'm doing pretty good these days. [knocking] Just a minute. Oh, hang-- hang on. There's somebody at the door. Oh, hi, Officer Nealon. What'd I tell you, Mr. Turrell? About what? Of About unlocking the door-- you're supposed to ask who it is first. I forgot. Um, excuse me. I got somebody on the phone here. Manny, you have to hang on just a little while longer. I-- I got some business. I'm real sorry, but I-- I never been in this-- what do you call this that I'm in? Protective custody. I've never done it before, you see. Well, after tomorrow, you'll never have to do it again. We want to keep you in one piece, right? Right. I'm going for some food. Would you like me to bring something back for you? That-- that would be nice. I'll just have whatever you're having, except no red meat or fish. I hate fish. Um, I like chicken. Chicken it is. I'm leaving Officer Gross here with you while I'm gone. He'll be right outside. Officer Nealon? A bottle of wine might be nice. White wine goes with chicken. Any particular chateau? No, as long as it's got a picture of that funny looking bird on it, it'll be fine. A regular gourmet, Mr. Turrell. Manny, I'm going to have to call you back. I'm getting ready for dinner. I'm having room service sent up. Fancy hotel room, white wine and chicken, Turrell, you're a slick son of a bitch. [SINGING] She's my little sugar booger. The boys, they all want to hug her, but she'll only pucker up for me. Dee, dee, dee, Dee, dee-dee dee dee-dee. What's the matter, Leonard? You don't look happy to see me. [screams] You son of a bitch! Holy shit! You forgot to flush. [screams]. Help me! Somebody! Officer? [inaudible] [screams] You stay away from me! [laughs] No. L'chaim. No! Let go of me! Make sure you look both ways before you cross, Leonard. Oh my god, please let me go. Please let me go I'm sorry. I told them-- [horn honks] Say cheese, Leonard. [screams] Robin. Robin. Oh, Robin. Hey. Grubeck. Grubeck, you asshole. Wake up! Wake up, you son of a bitch. Well, either you're some kind of magician, or you've got yourself a hell of a partner on the outside. Excuse me? Leonard Turrell is dead. Leonard Turrell. Who is Leonard Turrell? You're not going to get away with this. Get up. Come on! Your sister is a freshman at Slate River College. So what? Be nice to me, or I'll be back in school before you know it. Get out of here. This ain't a joke, Susan, we have this guy dead to rights. Lemmish, I thought you were disbarred last year. Any charges of misconduct on my part were purely circumstantial. The case was acquitted, and my good name was restored. That's a matter for debate. Stephen? Phil? How did you sleep last night? Like a prince. When am I free to leave. Well, I'm having a little difficulty with that, Stephen. Miss Lawler here seems to be having a difficult time absorbing the facts. The fact, Mr. Lemmish, is that your client is a prime suspect in five serial murders. The bottom line, Stephen, is that, under the present circumstances, the prosecution is bereft of any evidence against. Leonard Turrell most unfortunately passed away last evening. The cause of death remains undeterred. He was murdered, Mr. Lemmish. He was run over by a trucker who was so tired he couldn't see straight. That's what we know. That's all we know. Turrell was their only link to implicating him. I've beseeched the judge to set bail, but the judge, however, thanks to Mrs. Lawler's persistent screeching, Mr. Lemmish, please. We have other evidence. Blood and skin samples found in the locker room where Lloyd Glaser was first assaulted. Now I'm not going for life imprisonment here. I'm going straight for the chair, and I will see to it personally that your client's stay on death row is a brief one. Good day, gentlemen. Good day Mrs. Lawler, and do drive safely. [laughs] [phone rings] MAN [ON PHONE]: Out of the darkness and into the light comes your horoscope on this dark and stormy night. Give it a rest, asshole. [windowshade slams] [phone rings] I said enough, asshole. Eh, Spike, watch where you point that thing. [phone rings] Hey, Robin. Hey Spike, what are you doing here? Yeah, if you've got a minute, there's something I've got to show you. Yeah, sure. Follow me. So how have you been? What you think? That good, huh? What's this? Grubeck's phone bill. His phone bill? How did you get this? I broke into his house. Spike, you broke into his house. Isn't that dangerous? Yeah, well it's not half as dangerous as getting out of here. Look at it, Robin. There'll all number from the horoscope card. Yeah, there's more than 100 phone calls in a month. So what are we going to do? I don't know. If we can convince your father that there's something going on here, that there's some connection between the phone calls and the murders? Convince my dad about this? I mean, give me a break here, Spike. All we've got to show people here's a phone number. You said you used to work in Grubeck's office. Yeah, in fact I'm supposed to be there today. Can you get into his desk? I don't know. I can try. Robin, you have to try. What am I looking for? I don't know. All I know is that Turrell was the only guy that can put Grubeck away. He's dead. And there's only one explanation. That Grubeck killed him. Oh wait a minute, Spike, you're forgetting something. Grubeck was in jail. No, you're forgetting something. We're not just dealing with Grubeck anymore. Hi, Mrs. Shickley. Hello, dear. [phone rings] Hello? MAN [ON PHONE]: Out of the darkness and into the light. [screams] Help me! Yes, doctor. Yes, she's here. Robin, why aren't you lying down? I'm fine. Then if you're well enough to walk, you're well enough to go to class. Now, I've got your father on the phone. Why don't you talk to him right now? Here. Better not be contagious. Hello, Dad? Hi, Robin. Nurse tells me you took a little spill. What happened? Robin: Dad, I'm fine. Look, there's something very important I have to tell you. I'm listening. Someone else in Slate River is going to die. What makes you think so? Robin: I was in Mr. Grubeck's office this afternoon. And I reached over to pick up the phone-- I don't know. All of a sudden, I had this flash. Flash, what kind of flash? Robin: I don't know how to explain it. I just saw these things. And there was this woman. She was in a car. And she was in pain. In pain? Like she was being burned by fire or something. And I don't know. Mr. Grubeck was there. And he was watching her. He was laughing at her. It was horrible. Robin. Robin, I know you're fairly close to Mr. Grubeck. But I just, I guess I just didn't realize how badly all this was affecting you. Now that I do, I'd like to help. Dad, you don't understand. I saw this woman. And I saw Grubeck. He's going to kill her. Look, honey, I want you to stay there till I come by and pick you up. You don't have to do that. I'm fine. I'll just talk to you later. [phone rings] [phone rings] Hello? MAN [ON PHONE]: Out of the darkness and into the light to comes your horoscope on this dark and stormy night. Push 666 for your horoscope now. What the hell? MAN [ON PHONE]: A rather apt phrase, I see death on the road ahead. You won't like death, Susan. There's no future in it. Who is this? MAN [ON PHONE]: Your mystery date for this evening. The man you would place on death row. Don't you know it's impolite to hang up on people, Susan? [laughs] If it were that easy to be rid of me, you'd still be alive a minute from now. Where are you? Hey, hey, this is Stabbing Steve, coming to you on K-Hell from beautiful downtown Hades. The temperature is unseasonably warm down here, getting hotter all the time, baby. Now a special dedication. Hope you dig it, Susie because it's your final number. Come on, let's go cruising. [music playing] [screams] Stop! [horn honks] [screams] Help me! Help me! [screams] [screams] Mr. Grubeck? Hello, Robin. Some drivers just shouldn't be on the road. Forgive my appearance, Robin. I've been beside myself lately. I don't understand. Shh. You have a good heart, Robin. You always have. Those afternoons when you worked in the school office, they were the best part of my day. I've dreamt of touching you like this, feeling your skin, so smooth, so beautiful. We're meant to be together. I've always known that. And now it will be, soon, forever. What are you going to do? I'm going to take care of it. [police sirens] You feeling any better? Can't you just check it out, Stony, what's it going to hurt? Robin. Stephen Grubeck is in his cell. That's where he's been. And that's where he's going to stay. I want you to check his cell. Look, I'm having a rough day too, Robin. Don't make it any rougher. I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. I don't know what else I can say to make you believe me. Robin, I'd like to believe you. I really would. That's why I think, at this point in time, an unbiased professional opinion would be more helpful. You want to send me to a shrink. I can't believe this. Dad, I saw the woman who was going to die. I saw it. And I knew it was going to happen. And just because I can't explain it, you think I'm going crazy or something? No, I don't think you're going crazy. I believe you saw something. And you're right, I can't explain it. Not now. But as far as Grubeck getting up out of his cell and committing a murder, Robin, what would you like me to say? Just forget it, Dad. Robin, where are you going? Where am I going? I'm going to go out and play in traffic, talk to some parking meters. You know, some good old loony stuff like that. I'll be sure to tell you all about it. Thanks a lot, Dad. You know, the thing I don't understand is why me? I've never any kind of ESP or anything like that before. I don't know. And all of the sudden, I have this power, and I don't know why. I know the feeling. I guess we're the lucky ones. And Grubeck. You know, I never, in a million years, would've dreamt he felt that way about me. The guy is somehow channeling all his bad energy towards you. But the thing we've got figure out is, how does this guy get to be in two places at the same time? Wait a minute. Take a look at this. I found this in Grubeck's office the other day. Contact L's Astral Research. What do you think? I don't know. It sounds like it has something to do with astrology. What are you doing later? Stay out of my dad's away, for starters. You know, I think I'll go over to Paula's. Her parents are out of town. I'll meet you there at 10 o'clock. Wait a minute. Where are you going? I'm going to go contact L. Excuse me? May I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for a book on out-of-body experiences. There's over 300 such categories. Can you be a bit more specific? Well, you know, something along the lines of the astral category. You mean astral projection? Yeah, exactly. Then please walk this way. Lady, it takes years of training to walk that way. So um, what is it with this place anyway? What do you mean? Well, I mean, you know, the open till midnight, and all this spooky stuff. Is this some kind of joke, or what? We're a specialty shop that deals with delicate matters of the occult. What did you expect, 7-Eleven? So what's your specialty? Do you have a preference? Not at the moment, no. You're very cute. You kind of remind me of a young Freddy Krueger. You kind of remind me of Elvira on steroids. You say the sweetest things. There's two important facts to know when dealing with astral projection. The first is that the astral body is not a mirror image of the physical one. It is rather a reflection of the soul, of either its beauty or depravity. Hey. The devil wins. What's the second fact? That a person may release his astral self during the state of sleep, or under extreme duress or pain. How much does this thing cost? Come here. I'll just do a little browsing. Well, you know, we'll be closing in a couple of minutes. So why don't you stick around and grab something to eat? This is gross. Can't we watch something else? But we're getting to the good part. This is where the zombies break into the house and murder everybody. The last thing I need right now is a horror movie. Hey look, they're showing "It's a Wonderful Life" on PDN. It's just a bunch of dumb angels and stuff. Besides, they run it 236 times every Christmas. I don't think I can take much more of this, Paula. But then we'll miss the scene where they eat the lady's guts-- which reminds me, I'm hungry. I'll make some popcorn-- if we change the channel. Merry Christmas [inaudible] Merry Christmas! Hey that's not fair! Merry Christmas, Daddy. Kids! Pete! Come on, give. [eerie wailing] I say George Bailey. No, zombies. - Bailey. - Zombies. Bailey. Zombies. All right. Besides, I have seen this a few times already. I never would have guessed. You hold down the fort, and I'll grab some corn, OK? Mr. Martini, how about some wine? This is so dumb. Has this ever happened to you? Turn on the television set, darling. OK. What the? That's the VCR remote. This is for the CD player. Garage door opener. Ooh! Oops, vibrator. Sorry about that. Now, say goodbye to those old fashioned, battery-eating remote controls. Introducing Alco's new multifunction Zap-o-Matic. Yes, Zap-o-Matic, the miracle wand that controls every electrical device in your home. With Zap-o-Matic, you need never leave your easy chair again. Mr. Grubeck? Yes, your wish is Zap-o-Matic's command. Simply flick our miraculous Percepto-Switch and Zap-o-Matic actually puts you in the picture, Paula. [christmas caroling] [inaudible] Harry. Harry. I thought we were too late. Harry, I got in here from the airport just as quick as I could. Flew all the way up here in a blizzard. [inaudible] New York? Oh, I left right in the middle, as soon as I got Mary's telegram. Good idea, Ernie. A toast-- to my big brother George, the richest man in town. [cheering] [christmas caroling] Look Daddy, every time you ring a bell a zombie takes a soul to hell. That's right. That's right. Um, that's not in this movie. [zombie noises] [screams] [screams] No, Susie! [screams] I see we're back to the horror movie. [screams] [screams] Hello Robin. Is this a bad time? What do you want from me? Only the important things, Robin. Only your soul. 911. [IN ROBIN'S VOICE] Hello please, my name is Robin Jameson and I'm at 315 Pond Lane. I just killed my best friend. I don't understand. Why are you doing this? It's been a tragic evening, Robin. But who committed the murder? Mr. Grubeck? They'll take one look at this place, and when all is said and done, they'll come up with one answer. You're unstable, Robin. They'll lock you up in your own little cell. And then, every night, I could be there with you, helping you through A your troubled time. No! Stop! He killed her. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. He came to a rather sad end, didn't he. Unimaginative. There are so many more creative ways to handle such matters. For instance, I should be behind bars. And indeed, I am. I'm going to kick your ass, psycho. You can't touch me. But I can touch you. We'll meet again soon. Scout's honor. Let's get out of here. Come on! Hey killer. I've got the skin cream the doc ordered for you. [laughs] Sweet Jesus, your face looks like a map of the moon. Actually it more resembles the biography of hell, [laughs] a region you'll be familiarizing yourself with soon. Now how are you going to chase all them young co-eds looking like that? Crater face! Ooh, I'll dazzle them with my personality. [laughs] WOMAN [ON POLICE RADIO]: 7 Adam 21. 7 Adam 21. Two suspects may be in your vicinity, one in connection with a possible homicide. Spike, where are we going to go? Nowhere. Grubeck wants me, and there's nothing I can do to stop him. Yeah there is-- we kill him. What? We kill him by getting rid of his physical home. The astral body dies when the real one does. But wait a minute, Spike. Grubeck's in jail. Yeah, well as long as we've got him locked up, we've got nothing to worry about. I'm going to lure his spirit away, and you take care of the body. Spike, I don't know if I could do this. Look, as long as he's chasing me, you've got nothing to worry about. Oh Spike, I don't know if I can do this. I just want this to be over. You're the real hero here, kiddo. I'll meet you at the point. Let's go. Hey, Grubeck. Hey Grubeck! Come on out, psycho. Let's have a little fun. Now you can't have Robin, but you sure as hell can have me. All right, if you insist. Time to put the pedal to the metal, as I believe the saying goes. [horn honks] Jody? Jody? Is anybody here? [horn honking] [laugh] [horn honking] Jody? [screams] Come on. Come to Daddy. I've got something for you. [brakes screech] Semper fi, hero. [screams] Now then, I was hoping you'd come to visit. What did you do with Spike? Spike took a vacation from the rest of his life. It's you and me now. Now and forever. No! [crying and weeping] [otherworldly sound] Spike? Spike are you here? Spike? [cries] - Such a nice view. [screams] I've got quite a bit of suffering for you. Stay away. And still I suffer. That's my tragedy, Robin. I could have any woman on Earth, and yet I want you. You want me because you're dead. That's a very good point. And I'm in a position to negotiate. So, I'll make you an offer. Your life for your love. No. I can't and I won't! Reconsider. Tell me you love me, Robin. - No. - I'll never tell anyone. No! I love you, asshole. Huh? [screams] Spike. Dad, it was horrible. Could have killed all of them. I know, sweetheart. Sheriff and I just came from the police station. I just feel so badly. If I'd have just listened to what you were saying, maybe none of this would've happened. I'm just so terribly sorry, sweetheart. Daddy. We just pulled Grubeck's body off the rocks. Robin, do you have any idea how he got there? Spike. He came to rescue me, then he knocked Grubeck over the cliff. Spike is dead. He bought it in a crash off Route 39 over an hour ago. Wait a minute. He lured Grubeck away. Who was luring who, Robin? If Spike is dead, who was it that killed Grubeck? I told you. Don't say anything, Robin. Do you think-- Don't say anything. Dad, do believe I did this? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. Daddy, I didn't kill him. Don't hurt her. Daddy, I didn't kill anybody! Don't let them do this to me. Daddy, Daddy, no! [muffled screaming] [phone ringing] [evil laugh]
