- Open the glove compartment. - Where did you get that? Isn't that Connie's? - I figured she didn't deserve it. It belongs to a real beauty queen. - Wait. What about Connie? - I finished it with her for you. - I really like you Niall. - What was that? - What? - I thought I, I thought I heard something. - Who is that? - What the hell is this? Who is that? Yo. Come on stop this. Let me see. What the fuck did you do? - If you help her this is on you. - What? - Leave her. Come on let's go. - Connie we can't just leave her on the floor. - Go. I'll deal with this. Go! - She's alive! - Jamie. I burnt them again. - How can you be so bad at it? - I don't know. - Give it here. Alright I'll teach you okay? - Okay - Marshmallow on a stick. Hold it there. - I'm watching. - Then you get it out and there we have it. The perfect marshmallow. - You look so good eating those. - Thanks, piss off. - I am freezing. - Well go and turn the heat on - I can't, parents don't know I'm here. - You said they were gone for a few weeks. - Yes, but they didn't give me permission to come here on my own, especially after last time and especially not with you. - Yeah they're never gonna forgive me for that. - They'll get over it. I'm their little girl remember. You gonna thank me for dinner or what? - It was alright. - I'm serious that took me all fucking night. - It was good. - You are gonna thank me properly. - What if he's there? What if it's them? - Well if it was them they wouldn't have to ring the doorbell would they you idiot? - Who do you reckon it is? - I don't know. Hello. - Who was it? - I don't know. But they left this. - Okay, so someone just dropped this off then. - There's not another house in four miles. I highly doubt someone just dropped it off. - You got a secret admirer. - That I can actually believe. - Yeah cause it's you. - Of course it's me - May I? - Yeah - That's you. - Fuck off it's nothing like me - That's you - Well then this is you. - Weston Prep. - Isn't that our year book? - Yeah, so why would anyone send us this? - I hated her. - Yeah. - Aww, look at Niall. - Look look hands off their picture, get off get off! Year eight. The hair - That was cool at the time - It was not cool, it was never cool. - Three other people had it. - Okay the three other people, who were the three? - Um. - Hmmmm, exactly. There were no three, it was just you. - No, no, no, we should go to the police now. - No no one knows it was you. - What? - Nothing. - There must be something, you just went dead cold on me. - I'm just thinking about her. - I thought we weren't gonna talk about it anymore. - I know Jamie but sometimes I do think of Frankie. - Just stop now, just listen right. If she didn't go away for it then you would have. - No one deserved that. And then poor Lorraine. - Just stop! No! Lorraine, I just don't have time for it. She didn't die from it. She's disabled but she didn't die from it. I'm sorry - Fuck Jamie. - Good way to kill the mood. - Yeah, I'm gonna get a drink. - Get me one? - No. Jamie, I'm creeped out, I think someone's here. Okay, stop fucking around now Jamie. Jamie, Jamie look at me, look at me. Jamie please look at me. What the fuck? Don't touch it, don't touch it! No! Let's get out of here, come on, come on. I need you to run, come on. - Stop, stop, stop! - You're okay. - I'm not I'm, bleeding, I'm bleeding. - I promise you, Jamie you're okay. Jamie we need to go please, please. - I can't, I can't! Okay. Okay. - No, no, no. Please no! No! Please no. Please no! - Right before you say it, I'm sorry. I know I'm late but I just didn't wanna forget anything. - Hey hey hey it's fine, calm down and kiss me. See, it's a much better way to start this wonderful and weird journey. - About that. - What? What? No, are you second thinking going? Frankie look we've been through this. It's worth going and seeing them again. - Yeah, seeing them again. Great. I don't know. What If I can't go through with it? What if I get there, I freak out and I want to turn around? - Well then we turn around and we come back. Look Frankie, those girls had you put away for two years of your life for a crime that you didn't even commit and they owe you. - Owe me what? - They owe you at least an apology. So you can get over this and move on with your life. - Dear Frankie, you are invited to a private celebration of close friends from the past. We can't wait to see you once again. Yours truly, Emma. I don't know. I'm just scared you know? - Yeah but you don't have to be alright. I won't let anything bad happen to you, okay? You ready? - I guess. - Good. It's a long drive ahead of us. - This place really is something. - It is indeed. Hello? - In here. Frankie. It's me Dina. It's been so long. Now this is my boyfriend Ray. Ray this is Frankie, she's an old school friend. Hold on. Who is this handsome fella? - I'm Josh, her boyfriend. - Good going Frankie. Another drink anyone? - Oh yeah I'll have whatever is going. - Yeah wine would be great. - When we arrived we couldn't believe Emma actually lived here. - She's not the best host is she really? Leaving the guests to attend to themselves. - Here's yours. I would have done the whole hello blah blah blah but we all know you hate us so why not cut the crap? - So, is anyone else here or are we the first? - Niall's here. - Is he still dating Connie? - God no they broke up before college started. - Well I wouldn't know, I didn't get to go. - Knew it. Told you she hates us. - Ignore Ali, shes been drinking since we got here. Frankie hey, how are you doing? - Yeah good thanks, yourself? - Yeah, things have seen me well luckily. Glad you're doing well though. You deserve it. Niall, nice to meet you. - So, how long's it been huh? Since we were all together like this? Must be what, like eight years or something? Well how about we toast. Nice place huh? Ray stop it - Why? - Wait. Did you hear that? - What? It was probably nothing. - You don't know my friends. - Dina can we stop all this? - What? - We're not at school. If they wanna play around let them. - You really don't like my friends do you? - Well it's all a bit childish isn't it? Silly little girls playing silly little games. - Well you didn't have to come. Ray let's just go downstairs and see if something is there. If nothing's there, nothing's there. No harm done right. Come on. - What's up? - Frankie! - Anna, nice to see you. - Come here. - Josh, Frankie's boyfriend. - Anna, you too. - Nice to meet you. - So I am gonna get some wood for the fire place otherwise it's not gonna last the night so yeah, I'll give you girls some alone time. - Ah damn, Emma? Emma are you down there? - It could be mice? What? It could be? It's an old place? It could very well be mice? - You know I hate mice. - Come on. - Didn't know you had a boyfriend? - There's a lot you don't know. We met while I was away, we connected and he's always been there for me. You know the others are inside, you should go say hi. - Yeah, no I will. Driving for all those hours made me fell kinda sick so the fresh air is good. - Yeah the drive was long right? - Yeah so long! It's good to see you Frankie. Like I mean it. I was kind of worried you weren't gonna turn up. Is she here? Connie? - No, I haven't seen her as of yet. - So tattoo parlor, what's that like? - Yeah its really great actually, it's going really well. - Ali, looking exactly how I remember you last. - Connie. You made it. - I wouldn't miss it. - Um, do you want the usual? - Sure. - Very pretty. - You seen anyone else? - No, I mean it wasn't exactly the first thing on my to-do list after I got released you know? - Yeah I do. - What about you? - Um, yeah, no, I saw Emma last year working in a perfume counter, the others, not so much. I heard Connie's a lawyer now? - Connie is nothing but a fraud. She packed in the lawyer career after just a year of studying. She gave up and went back to live with her mum in Australia. That's the only reason Niall's here. Desperate much. Anna you look better. - Thanks. It's good to see you too Dina. - She's here. Connie. You coming in? - You're gonna need more than that to break the ice in this room. - Connie. It's been a while. - Well it wouldn't have been, had you returned my calls. So Dina, who's this? - This is my boyfriend, Ray. - Nice to meet you. - Well you sure know how to pick them, huh? Is he loaded? He's loaded isn't he? And some things never change? Look at you two back together again, who would have thought? - Connie. - Frankie, how's things? - Yeah, they're good, Connie - Hey guys come check this out. - We've all got one. - What are these? - Presents. - Emma, you shouldn't have. - Open it. - Haha Emma very funny. You can come out now. - I don't think Emma would do something like this. - Oh you've got a note. - Dear Frankie, welcome to our reunion! Pick a room and get ready, but don't be late for dinner. It will be served at eight PM. PS, it's invitation only. Emma. - Jess has a box. - Jess is invited too? This really is a reunion. - Where's Jess' doll? - Hi I'm Jess. This is Emma's house right? - I mean this is obviously some dumb game being played by the girls. They're messing with us. - Someone's here. - Who's car is that? - Game over girls. Come on let's go see what she's playing at. - Excuse me. - Hello? Is anyone there? - Connie don't go out there we don't know who it is. - You guys are such pussies. - Do you see anyone? - No. No one's here. - Is the engine on? - Yeah. - That's weird. - They're down there. I know they are. - Huh? - Babe? Do you hear that? There's something in the walls. - Forget about these noises. Come here. - Hold it. We've got all night. Ray - Yep. - What? It said formal wear. - Yeah it said formal wear as in formal, not like you're being knighted. - Alright. I'll forget about the fucking tie then. - Hey what the fuck is with the attitude Ray? - The attitude is a reaction to the way your friends talk to me. It's a result of your friends being patronizing little shits. - Okay where the fuck did that come from? - I don't know, what Connie said earlier. - What did Connie say earlier? - You were there. That you're only with me because I'm wealthy. - Of course Connie said that. She's a bitch. And she's got no man of her own and shes just jealous. - Well your friends just aren't nice people. And I don't know why you give them the time of day. - Just calm down. I hear you. And that was a shitty thing for Connie to have said earlier. Alright? - Is there any truth in it? - Of course not Ray. That's an incredibly insulting thing to say. Alright? Come here. - Josh do me up. - You look stunning. - Josh. I'm scared. - Of what? Hey Hey hey, of what? - The anger I felt earlier - There's nothing abnormal about that. Obviously you're gonna be angry, they let you take the fall for something that you didn't do. - No but it wasn't just anger though, it was like hatred. - Oh, looks like I have a mystery admirer. She doesn't even look like me. So you like watching do you? Well get a load of this. I don't have time for catch me, rape me. - What are you doing? - Nothing. I was just gonna go have a shower. - Niall I know it's you. - Oh looks like you're sitting next to me. - Where am I sitting? - Oh looks like you weren't invited Joshy boy. Ditto to you my friend. - What? - There are no places set for the uninvited guests. - Yet Emma and Jess have places. - Yeah where exactly are they? - Yeah come on ladies you can come out now. Joke's over. - Pointless, I mean if they've gone this far there must be some grand finale. Let's wait it out. See what they've got planned. - Ray just take Ali's seat, its not like she's turning up anyway. - Why's she not turning up? - She said something earlier about maybe going home and haven't seen her since so take her seat and if she does turn up she can find a spare. - Hey what's inside that? - What the hell is Bluff? - Oh I used to play that when I was little. So you open up a question and you can either tell the truth or you can bluff the answer so make everyone believe your lie. - I guess that's tonight's entertainment then? - Sweet. Pass it here, I mean it could be fun right. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Who wants to go first? No one. Dina? Dina. Let's do this. Okay, I think this is slightly different to how you used to play Anna. - Wait the question cards are handmade? - Yes Emma and Jess got a bit creative over the weekend. Anyway Dina. Is it true, is it true that you set up the prank on Lorraine Mayfield? - You crafty bitch. - Excuse me? - If you wanted answers you should have just asked me. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You know I thought this was a weird set up. We all get invited here for a reunion, what eight years after you were put away? Like what the fuck? Nice going Frankie. No Josh no, keep them out. You want this. Let's play by your rules. - I didn't do this Connie. - Dina, go, answer. Did you set up the prank? - Anna did. - What? - Don't lie Anna. It was your idea to play the prank on Lorraine. - No it wasn't, don't lie, it was you and Connie. - No Anna it was you. You said it when you were drunk and then we just got carried away and went through with it. - She's right Anna. It was you. - Funny that because you didn't seem to remember any of it when the police called you. - You had a choice Frankie. We all had a choice that night. You chose to go down there and help her. Had you stayed with us and stuck to the plan, we would have all gotten away with it. - I was doing the right thing. She could have died. - Doing the right thing ultimately got you sent away for all those years. Next question? - What was the real reason behind the prank on Lorraine Mayfield? - Seriously? Okay fine. She was a retard, she was a nerd. She was uncool. - That's not the real reason. - I can't back you up there Connie. - Well what was the real reason? - It was after one of the house parties. I was drunk and I knew she liked me. I'd had a few and wasn't thinking straight. I had lost Connie somewhere so I decided to go home on my own. And on my way back, I ran into Lorraine at the bus stop. She just had some fight with her step-dad and was talking about leaving town for good. We got talking and what can I say? - What did you do to her? - What the fuck Anna? What did I do to her? She told me she liked me. She said she was cold so I said we can get in my car and if anything she took advantage of me! The fucking state I was in and everything! How was I meant to know Connie was gonna come chasing after me that night? - I came to your place that night because I was worried about you. I didn't think I'd get back there and find you and that spaz getting it on in the car! - Wait so there was a reason for this prank the whole time? - Other than her being a complete reject, I suppose the deeper reason would be that she fucked my boyfriend and the next day at school neither of them knew I'd seen them. And then Anna came up with the idea to play the prank on Lorraine at prom. - I didn't know any of this. We were just talking about pranks, something to make our prom memorable. - Well it sure was memorable. You stabbed your best friend in the back that night. You turned on her like the rest of us. We all had a choice that night and Anna you did that So what kind of a person does that make you? - You're right. And I will never, ever be able to express how sorry I am for what I did to you. What we all did. I wasn't thinking. I was so young and so stupid. And I just jumped to the first chance in that situation. Please believe me when I say I have regretted it every single day. - I believe you. - This is so pathetic. - Fuck you Connie! There's no way they would have put all of us away for that but because of you they didn't see it for the accident that it was. They saw it as a single individual making an attack on a bullied girl. She's alive! - If you help her this is on you. - We can't just leave her! - Leave her. - Come on let's go. - Connie she needs help! - No, no, no, she needs our help come on! - No I cant! Fuck! - Lorraine? - What have you done? Get away from her! - Frankie pushed her! - Not a single one of you backed me up. Oh my god, do you not understand what we actually did? Lorraine fell in such a way that she broke several bones in her back causing her to be paralyzed from the waist down. We disabled a girl over some stupid prank gone wrong. A prank that you pushed on to all of us for some kind of sick and stupid revenge. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. I know what happened Frankie, you don't have to spell it out for me, but let me remind you that Lorraine disabled herself. - Oh my god. - She's the one who ran. - You know what, screw this. Fucking knew you wouldn't have changed. This whole thing has been a complete waste of time. - Hey, hey, hey, it's okay its okay, look at me. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Alright? Shall we? Okay. You wait here, I'll go inside and get our stuff alright. Okay, back in a minute. - Don't look at me like that. - You have absolutely no shame for what we did do you? Not only did we ruin Lorraine's life, we ruined Frankie's as well. Time to grow up now Connie. - Please stay. Look the real reason I came here tonight was to see you. Look I realize how much I fucked up that night And I would do anything to get our friendship back. Come on. - What's Jess' car still doing out by the gate? - Do you think it really is Emma and Jess or do you think that Lorraine girl has got something to do with this? - I don't think Lorraine Mayfield is capable of something like this. Although she would have a damn good reason to mess with us. - Well if I was Emma, I'd avoid showing my face after everything that's kicked off. - Yeah, tonight hasn't exactly gone to plan. - My mum died recently. She had MS. - Anna, I'm so sorry. - Seeing her fade away, it made me think about Lorraine. And what we did to her. We took so much away from Lorraine. We took away her future. And I couldn't live with myself. And that's why I came to see you. And when you rejected my visit I understood. I understood because you were my best friend and I let you take the fall. - What the hell is that? - What the hell is this? - Oh my god these are our dolls. Come on let's go. Let's go! - That crazy bitch is really here isn't she? She's out to get us. - What's going on out there? - Lorraine's here. It has to be her. - Oh no you don't. - Wait, where are you going? - To see who's fucking with us! - Do you really think we should go in there? - Stop being a pussy, Niall. - Who is it? - It's no one. Who ever it is, they're gone. - Belongs to a real beauty queen. - This is the crown you gave Lorraine that night. - Whoa, easy tiger. - Anything? - I have Jess' key, so if she wants it back she'll have to come in and get it. - No one was there? - No, nothing. - This was however left on the seat. Look if this is Lorraine, Emma, or Jess, I no longer care. I'm going to bed. I'll be leaving first thing in the morning. - You going downstairs? - No, why? - Don't you want to go and talk to your mates? - No I wasn't planning on it. - Alright, just fancied a beer. - Go get it yourself. No, I'm done playing games so screw them. We're leaving first thing in the morning. - Hey. - Hey. God I can't get any signal. - You can't sleep? Listen, I know you try to put on a front in front of all the others, trying to pretend you don't care, and everything is fine. But don't forget that I know you. And I know this is all bullshit. - I don't know what to do. - You're better than this. - I was thinking that when we leave here, do you wanna meet up? I know that I've got a lot to make up for and I know that you might never be able to forgive me. - Yeah, I'd like that. - Ray? Oh my god. Ray? - What's that? - Help me, help me! Open the fucking door! Somebody help me please! Help me, help me guys, help me! Anna please. Somebody's in there, somebody killed him, he's dead. - What do you mean there's someone in the room? Dina? Whoa whats going on? - He's killed him, he's dead, he's dead. - What are you talking about? Ssssh, ssssh. - He's dead, he's killed him. - Dina! Dina, what happened? Dina where is he, where is he? - He's in there, he's in there! - Dina he's not there, what happened? - Where is Ray? - Dina tell me what happened! - Calm down. - He's, he was right there. - He's not there! Look! - Oh my god, Josh. - Frankie, stop, Frankie! - He was right there. - Fuck! - It's Lorraine, she's here. - What? Who? - You saw her face? - She wore that mask. That mask we wore that night. It's her. - Lorraine can't walk, it can't be her. - We don't know what state she's in. None of us have seen her for years. Look she could be fine and walking free for all we know. - Does no one have any fucking signal? We need to call the police or something! - There is no signal! There's no signal here. - We need to get the fuck out of here now, come on let's go! - What? No! We need to stay in here! We need to wait it out in here! We don't know what's going on out there or who this is! We need to stick together and find out who the fuck this is together! - This isn't someone, this is fucking her, this is Lorraine I know it is! - I agree with Connie! We need to stay together, we're stronger in a group. We need to stay together. - No you lot are fucking crazy, we need to get out of here now. Come on let's go! - Come on! - No, no, no! - Come on, come on. - Frankie, Frankie. Listen, we're gonna get this son of a bitch okay? Come on. - Keys keys keys. Okay right we're gonna find the nearest house or petrol station and were gonna get the police sent here as soon as possible. - No we can't Niall. - Listen Frankie we'll gonna be fine. Connie. - This is fucking crazy going outside. - Please come with me, I can't leave you. - Please stay with me, please, please. - Okay just stay together okay. Barricade yourselves in the house until we come back with help. Niall, come on! - Be safe. - We'll come back with help. - Fuck. Move, get out the fucking way. - What are you doing? - What the fuck? - Open the door. Open the door. - It's not working. - What? - Come on, come on, come on! - I'm trying! - Okay drive. - Fuck! - What? - I need you to get out and push the car. - You've got to be fucking kidding me? - For fucks sake! Get round here. - I think we should have gone with them. - I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. - Go! Go Dina! Go! Go! - It's fucking stuck! - Do the fucking handbrake! - Fuck I can't see shit from here! Can you? Fucking hell! - Okay now start it up! - It's not working. Niall it's not working. - Keep trying! Keep trying! - Oh my god Niall! - No! - Open the door. - Wait for her. - She's done for, the killer is out there, we're in here, we're safe! - What? - Right, the killer has her, now's our chance, come on, let's go. - What do you mean? Go where? - We head for the fields, we keep running until we get somewhere. - I thought you weren't a complete bitch after all. - Don't go there with me! - You're fucked up! - Fuck you two! - No we have to help her, Connie we have to do something. - No! - No! - Connie's right. Dina's gone. We've got to keep ourselves safe now. - Please no, no, no, please. - Frankie? Do you think it'd be a good place to hide? - More like, where does it lead? Is that? - What? - It's Lorraine. - Holy shit. Lorraine? Lorraine? Lorraine? What's happened? What's going on? Lorraine what's going on? Please tell us what's going on. Lorraine? Lorraine? What is it? - Nothing. Why is she down here? - What have you done? Get away from her! - I think Sandra Johnson was Lorraine's mother. - Our headmistress? - Sandra Johnson. Terrance Mayfield, father to Lorraine Mayfield died of natural causes in 1998. Terrance's sister Sandra took custody of Lorraine in the absence of her father. - So she was Lorraine's aunt? - Sandra Johnson was there that night. The night of the prank. - Call an ambulance now! - Wait, you don't really think Mrs. Johnson is behind this? - Taking revenge for what we did to Lorraine. - Anna? What is this? - I think this is how we die. I'm dead. Sandra Johnson is doing this for you. - No, look I die here just like everyone else. She's doing this for her. - Well we've already broken the plan. Connie and Niall, they didn't die in the barn. Connie survived and I'm still alive. We can do this. - No, no, no! Fucking hell! Oh my god no, no! - Is that Connie? - Is that? - Hide. Hide. Anna, no, Anna! Please don't kill me! - Let go of her! Let her go! - Please I don't wanna die, please! - Anna are you okay? - I'm fine. - Open the door! - I can't it's stuck! Is there like a door or a window or something you can get out of? - Anna go, go and get help now! - I'm gonna come back and try and jam this door open okay? Okay I'll be back. I'm gonna get help, I'm gonna help What no, no. No. No Dina please. No please. Please stop, stop. I can make it okay. Please, no stop, Dina, Dina. Okay, okay Anna. Anna. Anna! Anna! Come and help me! Get it off! Get if off me! - I can't! - Come on! - It's too sharp, I can't do it! Mrs. Johnson? - What? Wait, the headteacher? What do you mean? - Mrs. Johnson was Lorraine's aunt. Mrs. Johnson was there that night, the night of the prank. Why are you doing this? You don't need to do this. She wouldn't have wanted you to do this, and killing us, killing us isn't gonna make her walk again, it's not gonna change the past. You gonna look at me? - Wait no we need to get Frankie! - Whatever let's go! - Who the fuck are you? - I'm the intelligent one, I'm the one thinking through, let's fucking go! - Fuck you, I'm getting Frankie! - Wait wait, where's Anna? - She went to, fuck the killer got her, come on you have to come with me, we have to go. - What? No, no, wait, wait, wait! Stop! We can't leave when there's nowhere to run! - Frankie we have to go please! - Anna's really dead? - Yes, I guess so but please Frankie we have to go. - Wait, wait, wait, look. Connie it's our only chance come on, come on! Please come with me! Connie come on. - What the fuck are we doing out here? - Connie we need to hide. We need to hide. Come on please, come on. Connie please. No let go! Josh! Oh god he's alive. He's alive Connie! Josh, Josh please get up. It's okay, okay, put your arm over me. Connie, Connie give it to me! Please help him please. - Frankie we're running out of time. We've gotta go. Okay you ready? Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Connie? - That bitch got me good with that bottle. - I've wanted to do that for years. - Think straight. Behind you. - Anna it's not what you think. Okay yeah it is. - Where the fuck have you been all night? I was supposed to go upstairs and get our stuff while you took care of your side of things. I've been on my own all fucking night! - I know but the fire distraction didn't do anything. - You were supposed to take care of Connie and Niall in the barn. - Josh I've had this bitch attached to me all night like a fucking tick. None of it went to plan because they didn't stay in the barn long enough. Don't look at me like that. - Are you fucking with me Frankie? - Meaning what? - Meaning as of right now, this all falls on me. Hey literally if the police fucking show up right now this all fucking falls on me. - So you really think I set this all up? My god we had a plan Josh and the plan didn't work so what was I supposed to fucking do? - While you've been running around playing survivor girl all night, I've actually been finishing these fuckers off. - I have blood on my hands Frankie. Fuck! Anna has more blood on her hands than you do at this moment in time! - Alright just calm down. I'll finish the rest of them off okay? - You know she finished Dina off right? - Didn't you get her in the barn? - Well when Connie went darting off into the woods I had to go and deal with that as well didn't I? And I thought Dina was a goner? Hey guess what Frankie? It doesn't even matter cause we're fucked. We're fucked Frankie! Anna went and killed Lorraine. We're fucked! - Wait Josh. Josh come back, stop! Listen to me for a second. Had you just listened to me before I would have explained to you why I had been running around like survivor girl all night because I got inspired. I just say we pin this all on Anna. - How the fuck is that gonna work? We spent this whole time making it look like Lorraine and Mrs. Johnson had been hiding out here for the past week, waiting for people to arrive. Anna was never part of the fucking plan! - Fucking shut up will you? Just think about it for a second okay? Her finger prints are all over the knife used to kill Lorraine. No okay so I don't know, she snapped when her mother died and the guilt of what happened with Lorraine. She was crazed and obsessed with me, would do anything for me and this was her way of making amends. - You're sick. - I'm sick? Fuck you Anna. You come to visit me one fucking time when I'm locked away in that place. And then you moan to me about your mother dying, about feeling all alone. What because you have no one now? You need someone to be there for you? You lost your mum. I lost my entire fucking family because of what happened to me. I cant get a job, my whole life changed, so now so will yours. - You're not gonna get away with it. You're not gonna get away with any of it. - Yeah we will. We will, we will, okay because. You see after you killed all of our friends, you confessed your weird obsession with me. I make a quick dash to the police managing to call them. But just before they arrive I get one quick jab to you with my knife and you are left as the only survivors. Come on Josh, come on. She's already killed Dina and Lorraine. Okay we have Mrs. Johnson here, we kill her as well and we can make this all out to be like it was all Anna's idea of the perfect bloody reunion. We can do this okay, we can do it. Josh I need you. I fucking need you. Please, please. - Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. - Okay right, go and get Mrs. Johnson okay, bring her down here. We blag something about how Anna sees her as the whole reason why this accident got out of hand in the first place okay. - You were dead. - I guess I just cry really well. Oh my god Josh. - You even managed to shed a tear. - Let's just finish this. - You're gonna fuck him over, I can see what's going on. If it doesn't land on me, it lands on him. - You really think I'd do a thing like that to him? - Yeah. - Josh was the only one who was ever there for me and you know what? It was his idea so if he were to take the fall, then I guess he had it coming. I recognized Jamie's car. He was the one that ran over Lorraine. I let Josh take care of Emma. I wanted to watch. Out of everyone, it was her who had the best place to host this event. We knew we could make the whole idea a reality if we set it here. Using her identity to lure you all in. - I am gonna get some wood for the fireplace. - Niall I know it's you. - Josh do me up. - Shall we? Okay, you wait here and I'll go inside and grab our stuff. - And it fucking worked didn't it? It fucking worked Anna. - Wait. Do you hear that? - It could very well be mice. - They're down there. - What have you done? - Well go on then. - No you've done nowhere near as much as me tonight, you do it. - I can't have her blood on me. - Just say you tried to stop the blood, it makes sense, do it! - Frankie, please, no. Frankie listen to me. - Shut up! - No, no! - Frankie listen to me. You don't need to do this. - Call the police. Hey. If you act anything like you did before, we're onto a winner. - Josh, please, please, please, please. - Hello? Police please! Please I need help. My name's Frankie Holingsway, oh god she's killed them, she's killed them all, Anna Nathan. You need to help us, there's only two of us left please! We're at 116 Tollgate Avenue. Please hurry! Okay I'd say we have about 10 minutes. Oh shit, Josh, Josh. Fuck. Where are you? Come on, do it. - What? - Do it. - I'm not gonna do it. - Anna, please do it. - I'm not gonna do it. I can't do it. - Do it Anna. - I'm not gonna do it. I can't do that. - Anna I can't go back there. I can't go back there. Please! I can't! No, no, no, no. - Frankie, no, no, Frankie. Stop it, no, no, Frankie. Frankie you don't need to do that. You don't need to do it Frankie. - Anna why, why did you do this to me? - What have you done to her? - Trust me. - No no! No No! No no! - Police! Police! Put down your weapons. Put the knife down. Put the knife on the ground now! Put it down. It's alright just stay calm. An ambulance is on it's way to help you.
