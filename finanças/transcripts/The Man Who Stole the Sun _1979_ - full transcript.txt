Screenplay by Leonard Schrader and Kazuhiko Hasegawa Director of photography Tatsuo Suzuki Lighting designer Hideo Kumagai Production designer Yoshinaga Yokoo Recorded by Ken-ichi Benitani Edited by Akira Suzuki Music by Takayuki Inoue Directed by Kazuhiko Hasegawa I'm back. Yes? What do you want? "1-3-27 Wakabacho..." Sit down. "Shigeo Sato." Just a minute. Wakabacho... what are you doing? Mosquito. Thanks. Millions of them around here. Come from the open gutters. A handy thing to have. Hey, I ain't no mosquito. "Police officer robbed of gun!" "Thief uses sleeping gas!" He's sleeping again. Everybody here? Not the guide. What the hell! Stay put, or die! All of you! What's so funny? Get going! To the Imperial palace! Tell me... what do you wanna do? Talk to the emperor. I must talk to him! What about? He knows. About my son. Close the gate! Fire! Shoot to kill! We've got you surrounded! Don't be a fool! Release the students this minute! He's got a machine gun. Aimed at the students. Throw out your weapons! Come out with your hands up! Let me. You on the bus! Tell us what you want! The snipers are ready. 20 men are here. 15 back there. Over there? It's a dead angle. Somebody's coming out. Who is he? A teacher. Anybody hurt? What kind of weapons? How are the kids? All safe? What does he want? I'm Yamashita. I'm in charge. What's he after? He wants to see... ...the emperor. He wants to talk with him. Fire when I say. But we might hit you. No other way. To your post. Make sure they're ready. I'll go, too. They're my students. Otherwise he'll get mad. Don't interfere. This is inspector Yamashita. Mr. Kido and I will join you. I'll talk with you. Don't shoot. I'm leaving my gun here. What do you teach? Science. Not much help now, is it? Halt! Stop right there! Hands on your heads! Keep them there! Wait! Not yet. All right. Come in. Squat there! The emperor is ready to see you. It's true. He'll talk with you. Did he really say so? He's very kind. I'm grateful. But first... release the students. The emperor wishes it. Don't move! Stay back! What's that? Open the gate! Don't do anything! Do as we promised! Stand fast! Shut up! Run! Fire! Now! Don't shoot! Stop firing! Ambulance! Get an ambulance! You all right? The old geezer was stone crazy. That is one slick cop. He's crazy, too. Bubble gum was great. I couldn't believe it was him. A lot of guts. He didn't even fall asleep. "Police officer is here!" Atomic energy is as powerful as the sun. Man first controlled atomic power on december 2, 1942 at chicago university. The fusion of neutron and protons creates a tremendous force equivalent to 10 of gravitation. In July, 1945, the first a-bomb test occurred in new mexico. The first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6. The power of a single atom destroyed the city and inhabitants. The Soviets first succeeded in July, 1949. The British tested one in 1952. Your world changes with the power of the sun in your hands. Today anyone can make an a-bomb. Even you. All you need is plutonium 239. "Who are you?" "Who are you?" "I'm..." "I'm..." "What do you want to do?" "What the hell do you want?" That's why atomic power plants are guarded. They take every precaution. Any questions? That's all for today. At dawn yesterday there was an accident at the Tokai atomic power plant in Ibaraki. A steel tower was damaged by the explosion of a homemade bomb. Was it a radical group? We've set up a task force to find the culprit. We don't know who did it. "Danger in atomic power plants." I don't like the theme. I think a radical group stole some plutonium. But we can't say it on the air. Plutonium robbery? That's fine! Good evening, everybody! It's me again - "Zero" Sawai. Somebody robbed the atomic power plant. I think the criminal is a 14 year old girl. She'll make a plutonium pendant for her platonic lover. No good. "Filtration done" Sorry, but it's time to say goodbye now. Thank you. "How to make an a-bomb" so plutonium oxide turns to plutonium metal. Any questions? Teacher! Will this be on the entrance exam? I want to study something else. Only our class studies this weird junk. The other stuff is easy. Study it at home. Stop bothering him. What's the next step? The exact amount of plutonium is difficult. You can't stop that moron. Let him do his thing. Your ID card. 500,000 yen. For three months. I'll pay it back soon. You a teacher? We get lots of teachers. Be careful. Don't waste it gambling. During the rush hour this morning two office workers committed suicide. Referring to the accident at the atomic power plant. The police announced a suspect today: Kunihiko Sakurai, 29. A radical revolutionary. The bomb at the power plant was the same as the one used to blow up the police station last november... "plutonium metal completed" I did it! I did it! I did the little beauty! Everybody have a copy? The answers are on the back. Check them yourselves. Start! Can we peek at them? It's easy! Is it true? Mr. Kido. Are you ill? I'm just fine. Good evening, everybody. It's me again. "Zero" Sawai. I'm sorry to say that there's no interesting crimes today. Why apologize? Listen. I'll soon have a daytime program. It gets too lonely at night all alone in the studio. Let's play something new. That's it. Police headquarters. The commissioner, please. Mr. Zenkichi Tanaka. He's in conference. You can leave a message. I think he'll talk to me now. I robbed the atomic power plant. One moment please! Tanaka speaking. You're a liar. You said the guards didn't carry guns. And I ain't no damn radical, either. Damn bastard! I mean, sir... I'm returning some of the stuff I stole. In a different container. Though. I won't tell you twice. So listen carefully, sweetie. Give me a sheet of paper. Go ahead. It's in the diet. In the diet. What? The diet building! In the ladies lavatory... couldn't be more terrifying. Making the metal is extremely dangerous. A perfect job. Secretary. What'll I tell the prime minister? I want a room facing east 14th or 15th floor. Is one available? I'll take it. My name is Kido... I mean, Kidokoro I look like shit. The most vile thing man ever made. No lectures. How deadly? Scatter just a few grains over Tokyo and countless thousands would die. This capsule shows the precise amount. If this was plutonium. It'd be a perfect a-bomb. With half the power of the Hiroshima bomb. Careful. That's my little baby. I'm Inspector Yamashita. Inspector Yamashita is here, sir. Hello, Mr. Yamashita. This is the prime minister's secretary. This is Dr. Ichikawa. We have a problem. I'll call again at eight o'clock. I want Yamashita to be there them. I won't talk to anybody else. He's a police inspector. What does that mean? I won't talk with bozo liars like you. That's all. Recognize the voice? I have no idea. A fag. That's how fags talk. Whoever it was. The voice isn't normal. He used a voice-scrambler. It changes the sound waves. So we can't get his voiceprint. A voice-scrambler and an a-bomb. Any student can make either one. The information is in any library. All the materials are in a hardware store. Except plutonium. But while making it, he'd probably get a fatal dose of radiation. Individuals don't need a-bombs. Only nations do. It's him. Yamashita. Trace the line. Hello. Mr. Yamashita? Speaking. Good to hear you. I like your voice. Cut it out. Get to the point. Don't get mad, big boy. It takes 1 minute 40 seconds to trace this call. We have plenty of time. Fine! I got lots of questions. Like what? Why me? Why pick me? Afraid to tell me? Because you're famous, big boy. I read about you in the paper. You're a hero. You killed an old man. I've got a little request. You listening? Sure. First. I wanna watch those TV baseball games to the end. Those bastards cut off night games for the 9 o'clock news. It's always the 7th or 8th inning. Just when the game gets good. It really pisses me off. I see. The Giants play the Whales tonight. I wanna see the whole game. To the end. That's up to the TV company. Don't give me that shit. You're the damn government. You can do anything. If not, I'll blow up the Ball Park. Got that, Yamashita? Now do it! The reason is... well. I can't tell you why. I mean, not now. Please understand. You must help us. Hello! No use. They think I'm joking. You don't understand. I want the prime minister. Hurry. Ten minutes to go. You want to see it too, don't you? The Giants have a rally going in the seventh. Unfortunately we have to sign off now. A home run would win it for them. But we have to say goodbye. Thank you, Mr. Aoki. So long, folks. Continue? I wasn't told to. I won't be responsible. Can I go on? By courtesy of the sponsors, folks, we'll continue till the last inning. Sadaharu Oh is at bat. A hard hit ball! A home run! Oh did it again! Me too! I did it too! I won! I won! Makoto Kido is a winner! Yamashita speaking. Nice job, pal. You passed with flying colors. Don't mention it. We're gonna get along just fine. Sure. What'll I call you? You mean my name? Yeah. I'm number nine. What - more baseball? No. Eight nations got a-bombs, see? U.S.A., USSR, China, France, England, India and unofficially Israel and South Africa. I'm the ninth. I'm no. 9. Goodnight. Hold it, nine. We gotta talk. Not now. I gotta watch the game. Goodnight. Any idea? "Second demand" "stop college entrance race" be quiet! Shut up! We got no idea. Then oh hit a home run. Don't be so modest. Speak up. What do you want? "Zero" Sawai's new program! "Telephone talk!" Just dial 03-354-0218. Let's hear some music. Hello. Zero speaking. Hello. What's the matter? I got an a-bomb. What? Speak more slowly. I have an a-bomb. You have what? An atomic bomb. Atomic bomb? You mean a real one? Fantastic. Where did you get it? I made it. I'm listening. I'd like to ask you... I wish you'd ask your audience to... tell me what you want. I can ask for anything. See? But I found out that I don't know what I want. Stupid, ain't it? What do you want? Let me see... all right, I'll ask people. "If you could have anything, what would you want?" Like Aladdin's Lamp. I'm serious. Of course. What's your name? It's a secret, of course! I'll tell you. It's no. 9. which is next to zero. It's your turn. Zero. Double check everything left on the scene. A man with an a-bomb is on radio! Zero. Don't encourage those loonies. But it's interesting. Aladdin's a-bomb. "Zero's new program! Aladdin's a-bomb!" Call me! Hello. This is Zero. I want to live in a house of ice cream and hamburger. Far out. I want the bomb to blow up. Easy, Fella. I want to go to Morocco. What'll you do there? I can't say. I'm too shy. What's this? I'll hang up. Don't you have a better idea? I wanna be the leader of a motorcycle gang. Drive a huge harley. Make the Asahi report Inoki on the first page. I want everyone to be healthy. Have the Japanese army make war on the American army. Make no requests. Just have dreams. Bathe with naked girls and rob a bank. I want a house of my own. I want the police to clean the streets in Tokyo. It'd be nice if all people in the world obeyed me. Are you listening, Mr. 9? Hey, I got an idea. A Rolling Stones concert! At the Budokan hall. How about it? I was all planned six years ago. They sold tickets and everything. But the government banned them. For drugs. As if they were gonna sell drugs in Japan. The Rolling Stones in Tokyo! I think it's great. What do you say, Mr. A-bomb? You sound like the man really made an a-bomb. It's just a prank, but Serious pranks can be a crime. We ain't even free to play pranks? Bomb threats can be dangerous. Am I responsible for that? We need your cooperation. Sure. It's not so easy. Is that a line-tracer? Looks like fun. Just a minute. Submit your request in writing. We did. Why is he such a big deal? I'd like to straighten him out a bit. You're back on Saturday? Two in the afternoon. If he contacts you before then, give me a call. May I have your card? Excuse me. You're from homicide? Appreciate your help. "Masuo Yamashita." Trace the call. I've got my second demand. What is it? You know the Rolling Stones? Yeah. We're studying them. So you heard the radio today? You bet. Noisy bunch. Then you know what I want. I want to see the show in three weeks. That's all. Hold on. It ain't that easy. The government can do anything. Maybe you'll even make some money. Be sure the whole group comes to Japan. If you fail, no telling what'll blow up. I'm counting on you. "Commendation to Mr. Makoto Kido." "For assisting the police to arrest the" "criminal who hijacked a bus at Sakashitamon." "Your bravery and..." has your wound healed? You must be busy. Yeah. Working on a stupid case. Stupid? We never run out of screwballs trying to make trouble. You look tired. Ain't got time for tired. Gotta stay healthy enough to do my job. Same here. About that silly case. Do you... gotta go, professor. You like the soup? Of course. It's good. I want to talk. I'll have soup too. I've been meaning to talk to you. I'm not sure I have any information. They're in Los Angeles. The Rolling Stones. What are you talking about? Stop pretending. We have news source. The foreign ministry is trying. You asked them to. Shall we sit here? No. I know a better place. The soup tastes better here. You're not gonna talk about this on the air, are you? Then I'm right! Mr. a-bomb listened to me. He ordered you bring the Rolling Stones. And you obeyed. That means he exists! He has a real a-bomb! Stop it! You scare me. Zero. You're free to imagine things. I'm not free! You had me tailed. Don't talk like we're enemies. I thought we were friends. Friends? Why? The bomber chose you. He chose me too. You too? I deal with murderers. Not these damn scum bastards. What do we have in common? Like you, he only contacts me on the phone. You want to befriend me? I know you're smart. You're a real pro, ain't you? What do you mean? You want to use me as a decoy. I'll kill any way I can. Don't kill him. Please don't. I'm not your friend. His friend? He gave me a dream. I owe him. Goodbye. "Rolling Stones coming to Japan!" The Rolling Stones are coming. Three cheers for a-bombs! But let's call it quits. I don't like to joke about a-bombs. The victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will get mad. "I made an a-bomb, but I don't know what I want." It was all a bad joke. It's over. Why quit? The a-bomb corner is sensational. Keep after that loony. He'll get mad and call again. You're the loony. Come on, a-bomb! Dial 03-354-0218. Hello! Zero speaking. You're a liar! Who is this? Number nine. It's you! I really got an a-bomb. The government obeys me. That's why the Stones will come. But... no buts! And no more lies. Let's hear some music. What - the restroom? Yeah. Back in a minute. You can manage. What? Zero is gone? Excuse me. It's falling. Let it stand. Take it easy. What do you want? Why follow me? Well... I'm "Zero" Sawai. The disk jockey. No shit. Oh, no. Give me a hand. What're you doing? Is your job interesting? I think so, for a girl's job. Got a man? A lover, a husband, a gigolo. We had a fight and parted last year. He was... a gigolo. I'm free now. And you? Me what? You like your job? Got a girl? So long. Wait. You aren't fair. I don't know you yet. What's your name? I got many names. Occupation? Screwball. Where do you live? Tokyo. Got a family? No. Your parents? Dead. I killed them. Got a sweetheart? I created her. Tastes sweet... chewing gum. You're cruel! Why did you do it? No. This one? No. This one? No! Definitely no! I'm afraid we can't make it. Don't try to help the criminal. Why should I help him? I want to see him again. Bring her a blanket. He had sunglasses. I saw his eyes only a moment. Let's do it again. Is it this hair? Not exactly. But it's okay. Which eyes look like his? None. Let's try the nose and mouth. They look like his. Let's find the eyes. This one? No. This one? This one? No! I said no! This one? No. "... Will die." Mr. Kido. You finally made up your mind. What about? You know what I mean. You're going to get married. I know everything. A man came and asked me about you. A private detective. He looked more like a gangster. Usually electric current doesn't run in air. But when it's pressurized, it will. Mr. Kido. Mr. Kido. Mr. Makoto Kido? Why run? You should pay the interest at least. You failed to pay last month. Look! You surprised me! Why? You really did! You're hurting me. You're the moneylender. Of course, you fool. The moneylender! Yes! I see. Will you pay? I have no money. No money? I'm broke. You look happy. Don't laugh it away. It's not a laughing matter. How long? 55... no, 50 seconds. You can trace the line in 70 seconds? But we can't use that method. No other way. But all the other lines will become dead. Everyone in Tokyo will die, if he detonates the bomb. We don't need your exaggerations. You sent your family to Hokkaido, commissioner. They went on a trip, that's all. They do every year. Can everybody in Tokyo go on a trip? He has a weakness. This! He wants company. He needs to talk. His only weakness. I understand. I'll tell the telephone company. It won't be easy. Do it. Ishikawa here. Go on with the operation. Here's an emergency call. Hello. Yamashita? Speaking. How have you been? Not bad. Hot, ain't it? You bet. Is your room air-conditioned? Yes. I only got a fan here. Too bad. I have an old air-conditioner. Tell me your address. I'll send it. Thanks, but no thanks. I'll buy one. Sure. I recommend a Hitachi. How much? About 300,000 yen. I can afford it. Give me half a billion yen. You want money after all. Why not five billion? The government is used to wasting money. Half a billion now. In used 10,000-yen bills. By noon next Sunday, May 1. No tricks. Damn it! Exactly 1 minute 50 seconds. That's good enough. It's noon. Are you ready? Trace the call. All ready, Yamashita? Yes, as you wanted. Cut the other lines. Two detectives who carry money must have a flag. A big one. You can mark it "police" if you wish. They must be at Jinnan junction in 30 minutes. Jinnan junction? Cut the circuit! Yes... what's the matter? Hello! You must move too. There's a teashop in front of Yoyogi station. The phone number: 379-0951. Wait there. Get it? No, but it's in Shibuya. It's Tadokoro. I'm ready. Do as I say. Is Mizushima ready? Yes. Trace the call. Hello. I want them to walk. With the demonstrators. All right. I want them to run. Run as fast as they can. Cut the fd lines! Run into the Yamate building, up to the roof. I said no tricks. The plainclothesmen and the chopper must leave. Can't you trace the call yet? Can't you read me? Send them away! Or no deal. Got it! It's the Tokyu department store! Can't you hear? Arrest all of them! Stay inside. Show me your bag. Investigation. Your bag! Open it! Dismiss your men. Then I'll tell you where the bomb is. Now I hear your real voice. Release the men! Or the bomb will explode. Tell us where it is first. No. Okay. It's a deal. I'll tell you where the bomb is. Good. Where is it? Under your table. Handle it carefully, if you don't want to get killed. "It'll explode at 4:30. 13'20" to go. Nobody can dismantle the clock. The circuit will close and it will explode. There's only one way. Remove the nails and wait. There are two codes that lead to the inside. One is red, the other black. If you cut the right one, the clock will stop. Red or black. You want to bet? We have to yield. But we got the bomb. We succeeded. The criminal is powerless now. Ten minutes to go. Yes or no? Yes. We'll lift the blockade. I'll tell you red or black when I'm free. You mean it? I don't want to die with you, either. All right. Wait. First, scatter the money. Tell your men on the roof to do it. Why? I want some confusion till I'm free. You can save Tokyo for half a billion yen. You can have some too. Nine minutes to go. Okay. We'll scatter the money. You're smart. Lift the blockade! At last I'm free. We have only 30 seconds, fool. Which code? Take it easy. 5 seconds will be enough. Red or black?! Cut either one. Red or black. Either one. I made it that way. Hurry! 10 seconds to go! You cut it? Can't you recognize that voice? Can you? It sounded familiar to me. I'll report to headquarters. I got you. Mr. a-bomb. I was. It's true. I'm with Mr. a-bomb. Why not? I'll be responsible. Cars can't follow us. Bring a chopper. I thought you ran away. Where did you get it? I stole it. It's fast. I know the room where the bomb is. The far right on the fourth floor. The corridor is... the boss is coming. He's mad. The bomb's still here. But the tools aren't coming until morning. What sound? I imagined it. This is an a-bomb? Director, this is Zero. We're off. Are you ready? This is Asai. We're waiting above Shiba Park. Understood. We'll drive along the course. What's that? Broadcasting. How will Mr. a-bomb escape with the bomb? Not a live show. Though. You're a fool. This is how I participate. Suit yourself. It's coming. Director, stay on course with the police cars. No joking. Duck! Director, we're heading for the designated spot. After a few more shots of the police. Don't hold on them too long. Well done. Our helicopter is coming. You're deeply involved now. I'm okay... maybe not. Who cares? I feel fine. We have the video tape. The police can't push us. Because they have to deny your existence. They're afraid. You're smart. Not as smart as you. Eat it. I have something to tell you. What? No, I guess I won't. It's here. Only I know your face. Live long. I took your hair... they were 36. I counted them. Live. Keep living. Get out of the pool! "Rolling Stones show" Mr. Yamashita. Mr. Kido. I'm surprised. You and the Rolling Stones. I like it for a change. You got a ticket? You can have mine. My girl couldn't come. She died in an accident. A traffic accident. A near-miss with a chopper. How about a walk? Be quiet. The a-bomb is near. It'll explode in 30 minutes. Up. Climb. Drop your gun. Slowly. Kick it. Handcuff yourself. Sit there. You like high places? Yeah. Fools and goats always do. It makes you feel peaceful. Damn. I should've known it was you. What the hell do you want professor? I want to talk. I don't talk to cockroaches. I just step on them. The Stones ain't coming. They'll announce it inside the hall. There'll be a riot. We're expecting it. The riot police will arrest everyone. We thought you'd be among them. Same old lies. Feeling sick? Why'd you do all this? Why pick me? I thought we could talk and fight. Fight? About what? I was wrong. You're a dog. Damn right, punk. A dog who's guarded this city for thirty years. This city is already dead. Killing the dead ain't no crime. Shut up! You got no right to kill anybody! The only person you can kill is yourself. The person you want to kill is yourself. Die! Go to hell! Let's go, you bastard.
