RAAPPAKAL [NIGHT AND DAY] Music MOHAN SITARA. Lord Krishnan! Stop there, you tusker! Kutti Sankaran, stop there. You svelte! Having traveled this far the tusker is not tired. You are tired after travelling in an auto-rickshaw. You are sniffy! The tusker can walk up! It is well fed, stomach full. Where as, I am fed half stomach! What is the fare? The meter charge and double of it. Do you have 3 meters? No jokes! Give me money and go. 50 Rupees in the meter... ...and double of it. That will be 150 Rupees! When you said you have to go to Easwaramangalam... ...from the festival site. I thought it is a quite a ride! I would not have agreed if I had to come after this tusker! Then, we will fit an engine to the tusker with 4 tires! Then it could gain speed. Take this and go. Walk elephant! You shy girl! In the corner of your eyes··· Is it a screw pine flower or the moon? Walk you, buffalo! I am quite done with walking so far! I saw you getting down from the auto-rikshaw! You got tired walking from the gate to here! You look after your cattle! Understand well that, there is a big difference... ...between a tusker and cow. Ofcourse, there is a big difference between a tusker and cow. There is no difference between a mahout and a milk man... ...in the social outlook! He is a real conservative! At this rate, the revolution in India, will be delayed further. You keep quiet! If the tusker is to stamp you... ...your revolutionary juice will come out. The tusker is my friend and my friend is my tusker! Nobody is seen here. Why linger over here? Nobody is seen outside. Why do you expect them to come and see the milk man? You could give the milk there and go! I saw the lady of the house in my dream yesterday! I just wanted to convey that! Nice trick! I know you want to borrow some money from Saraswathyamma. I will make it impossible to you! History has taught us that the universal struggle... ...between the rich and the poor... ...is triggered by the middle men like you! It is Janu Madam! Why don't you come a bit earlier? I am coming here since I am about 16 years old. I can take care of myself here onwards. That's it. The worker should never loose his self prestige. You get away from here. What is it Dassootty? The children are so adamant that they want to... ...go to the Vegaland during their school vacation. The wages for milking cows are not sufficient for me. It would be very helpful for me, if I get a higher wage! Vegaland on one side and revolution on the other. A poor worker like him is being tortured between these two. Tell Krishnan to give you what you want to have. Sankaran kutty Nair has come early today. I came here, when I heard that Kutty Sankaran has come after the festival. It's not only him I Govindan its mahout, is also here. You have to be here. That's why you are paid for! We don't want to let him for any procession any more. We are about to start the relaxation treatment! What do you say? - It is you to decide the elephant's matter. You have to ask Krishnan before that anyway. Where is he? - He fights with his enemy on the roof! By God! I wanted to do a noble thing! I don't want to subdue anyone! I will not subdue myself either. It is either me or you! One of us is enough here! Ok! that should be me. If you have no prestige, what can I do then? How long you have been outsmarting me? Where is it gone? 4 legs, a tail and a needless moustache! Is it gone? It is either in the kitchen or on the roof here. I don't want to kill you and eat you! You have to leave this place. Krishnan! - It's gone! I have come! Your fight with the bandicoot starts early morning! You called me here when I was about to catch it. I will catch it one day! The bandicoot too should agree for that. You have come after working hard. If you like, pour it over the head to cool you down. You are too young to tell big jokes like this! It will do only harm in the future! You are after all a woman! I haven't told any joke for you to laugh! If you tell any joke in future, keep... ...my laughter for that joke! Let it be secure with you till then. I can't take back my laughter what I have spent now. Has Kutty Sankaran come? The mangoes were meant to prepare the pickles. You've plucked them from the tree. Here is the money and the account. That can be seen later. I want to see the elephant first. I have to know if somebody has cast an evil eye on him. Do you think I've not looked after him well? Yes I do. It has happened before. How are you? Was the festival pompous? Are you okay? He was telling me to give relaxation therapy to it. That should not be for him like last year! The treatment should be for the tusker. Govindan do not realize that he is your mahout. You should at least realize that you are the tusker. Take the money and the account. The account for the festival of Kollangode! Unaccounted account of the Kolakedu festival. There is 150 Rupees as an unaccounted amount. It is accounted as the conveyance allowance. That is the usual expense allotted to you. You have exaggerated that expense! You have done some manipulation! Let me think it over! - It's the extra expense which has to be covered. The 150 Rupees may be for the auto-rikshaw! You mean the auto-rikshaw? The tusker, broke the glass window of it. He demanded 500 Rupees. After some bargain, I brought down to 150 Rupees! That 150 Rupees is in Govindan's account. Govindan borrowed 150 Rupees! Govindan has swindled 150 Rupees. Do you mean I've swindled you? You made a mistake. I might have written it wrong but you have to read it correct. You have really borrowed 150 Rupees! It is only a spelling mistake! I was scared. Never mind that. He has come after a lot of traveling. Adjust the expense in some other way! Who are you going to convince afterall? That is ethics! - It is not. There should be an account to kill or to bring up. The seed should have an account so that the crop will have an account. That is the real ethics. - Yes of course. What is the name for it? - It is Sambar(curry)! Do you call it so? Do you call it Sambar by cooking, chopped... ...vegetables of all kind? You should prepare it in the right proportion! Enough water, and enough condiments... for the vegetables and for the said members. You should bear it in mind... ...this has to be tasted by human beings. This isn't the first time I prepare Sambar! This isn't the first time I instruct you. Where is asafetida? - That...? Haven't you heard such a thing? You seem to misplace things! Incomprehensive old woman! I don't like anyone addressing me as old! I will then address you as dear! Dear! You both have started again! The condiments were little in excess, in the curry(Sambar). Then she added more water! When condiments seemed to be more... ...she added more...! Attend the call Krishna! The sound is very irritable in my ears, when touched! Yes, it is Easwaramangalam alright! Should I have to give to Januamma? I will give her. Tell me what? Should I whack her, or hit her? You mean the phone? I will give her. Oldie! - What? Janu dear! Your son is calling, from Persia! Her two sons are in Persia, but she comes here... ...each morning, to muddle up the cooking here! It is me son! - Why do you make her annoyed? I can't walk when I wanted to go some where. My legs are gone limp! If any of your children come, send a mobile phone with him. It'll be easy for me then, to talk to you when do my work. What work you do? The boiling vegetables, in the oven... ...know, how busy you are! You have become fussy, these days! You need only the food from the market... ...instead of the usual hay and grass! I'm going to stop giving you, powder food! Stop there and come here. I want to see your acting! What's the theme of your act? Is it The Elemination of Narakasuran or Keechakan? I told you to come to me. You are Oyoor Kocchu Govindan Pillai... ...and he is Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair, aren't you? I was asking him, why he is standing idle there! He was asking me why I have come without money. Why money? - For the tusker tail! So you are smuggling tusker tail! He told me he would make me a ring... ...with the hair on the tusker tail for me to get thro'the 10th class examination! He said that it'll cost only 25 Rupees! - That's good! You need not have to study then! The ring will see you thro' the 10 th class. These elephants are all passed the 10th class... ...just because, they have enough hair on the tails! Let alone their mahouts! Get away from here. You should not be seen anywhere here. The God has given the poor animal... ...it's tail with a few hairs on it. Why don't you let it go? I have not plucked the tusker's hair and sold it for money. Who shall I ask that to? Can I ask the elephant that? It may not know it, as the tail is at the back of it. The God only can create the tail on its head... ...of the one which belongs to the Koloth. Let it be there, where it belongs! Do a thing. You need an account for everything. Count the hairs on its tail and jot that down! Watch out for any spelling mistakes when you jot it! I tell this to you, because you are uneducated. You can count in the morning, evening and in the night... ...and make sure it is correct. You will get good sleep then and I will be in the clear! You have to die if you want to be in the clear. People will feel pity for the deceased and say good of those who are dead. It will not be in your case! The curse of the dumb animal will be there. Thanks that he stayed in the Koloth! Had he been the prime minister of India... ...I wonder what will be the fate of the mahouts in India! Tell me you tusker! Don't you have anything to say? Are you an elephant? I can't take the concoction any more. This is not a child's play. You have to take this for 41 days according to the doctor! Take it and drink it. It's easier said than done. Will you able to take this bitter drinks? Is it for me, the giddiness, body pain, and lack of appetite? I will give my company for you to drink this. Tastes like Amblapuzha delicacy! Drink it. Take this sugar candy now! If anything happens to you I will be the loser then! It is time for me to depart. The heat has subsided. Go and take it old lady! It could be your son from Muscat! If you had more children for you... ...you could have send them to China, Uganda and Pakistan then! Is it you Sudhi? - Give that to me! When you are only at the calling distance... ...you don't telephone me. You must be busy, is it not Sudhi? We are about to come over there during the children's school vacation! We want to spend our vacation with you! How is that? You have told the same last year also! Then you went to Thailand for luxury stay... ...with Jayasri and your children. - This is different. Urmilachi called from Thrippunithura... ...and told me they want to spend the vacation with mom. We have decided that. - Is it true? We have decided for a grand get together! We will call Devettan in Bombay and uncle from Ahmedabad... ...Sekaran uncle, and other uncles and aunts! You will have no more complaints! What about Malu then? Call her direct and talk to her! If I call her, she will give some excuses! What makes you think this way? I thought it is the right thing to do. Should I need a reason for that, then? It's high time we all been together. I could not just believe that. - You can believe it as well. You can be very sure of that. Shall I stop now? I am a bit busy here. He has disconnected it. Do you know one thing? What is that? - All will gather here, for this vacation! Is it? It is wonderful! It's time they came. When are they expected here? - Has he told that? He didn't say that! You should have asked him that. We have to get ready for that. Let everybody come! Kovilakam will awake then! It's only you, the lady and a few cows... ...live in that palatial house. Have you forgotten KuttySankaran? It is not only him. Me, Govindan its mahout is also there. Krishnan! You are forgetting yourself these days! I have just mentioned that. There will be the mahout in an auto-rikshaw along with the tusker! Those are the matters of the Koloth! The chiefs, elephants and the mahout! Where do a barber like you, com ing in? Mind your own business. He is not even good at that! Get more provisions, and stock them here. You have to get noodles in packets too! It was about 8 to 9 years ago, when I saw them, all together! I haven't seen them together since then! The chief Valliya Varma Thampuran... ...hasn't turned up even then, I gather! You said it right. Valliya Varma has not turned up, then! He knows about that, better than anybody! They are friends afterall. - We are playmates. Is he coming now? Let him come and go. It is their own home and homeland! Is he expected now? Let them all come, so that I can come to Koloth. Yes it is. - When he comes, don't come with the bottle, to greet him! You've muddled up last time with your dance and song! I had to clear it up all! Don't you remember? Will he remember that now when he is going to die? Don't play your dirty tricks on me. Oh gosh It'll be wonderful if all gather here! It'll be wonderful alright! Then it is the children then! The naughty ones! They will spoil all the fauna and flora! They will catch the fish and make the pond dirty! Even a squirrel or a partridge will not turn up that way. We have only those to talk with. The visitors will return back soon. The tusker need to have some palm leaves! The tusker and the palm leaves! You will be stamped with the tusker, you slimy barber! Shall I ask you, something, Krishnan? You can ask me later. Is it the time, to ask me that? Sudhi called me up and said that all are coming! That is the right thing to do. You may not see them, again tomorrow! Your elder brother insisted that all should gather here once. That's true! Everything has come to a stop after his death. It was good that Sudhi has thought about that. When did Sekaran uncle arrive? - I have arrived some time back! It is you, not to be seen! You won't be able to see me so easy! It's the time for the celebration here now. Come here. - Why do we need a light here now? It was lit, because I could not see anything! You are blind alright. Why do you need the light then? You get your eyes operated, or transplant your eyes... ...or put an end to your work and go away. The electricity bill is very high! You have to only fiddle with the switch! The bill is to paid from the Koloth! It is the account of coconuts of Mannissery! I am late by 4 days! Are the coconuts in Palakkad gone cheap now? We are the usual clients in the dealing. The price is very cheap now! The amount for selling coconuts... ...in Mannissery is 8634 Rupees! I have spent that money for some other purpose! It was for a couple of urgent matters. I will give back to you within 10 days! The same happened about 3 or 4 months back! I have heard nothing so far about it. He has some urgent expenses there! He has spent the money for some genuine matter! May be. I want the account to be correct. Sekaran uncle has borrowed the money... ...which is the price of coconuts sold in Mannisserry! It's been a long time, your cooing the same tune! It's time you have changed it. Aren't you listening to the music of these days? You have to change your way of life if you want to survive! You sing the same song! Then you can get along with that. We are the same old creations of here! Krishnan! I was wondering why we need... ...such a vast house just for two of us! If we could clean up the out house... ...I feel that, that would be enough for us! You will feel little relaxed then! It's just like tying the tusker in the cattle shed. Don't do that for my sake! Your hair have turned gray, here and there. Hair can only turn gray if it want to threaten us! It can't pelt bombs, and make others scary! Let it scare us! I have been taking care of all needs of all my children in time. It is only in your case, that I am being hesitant. I wonder what should be my answer... ...if Lord Krishna, tomorrow ask me, that! When you started in my grey hair... ...I knew that, it will end up in my marriage! When it is wife and two kids for me, after my marriage... ...you will build a house for me and tell me to vacate this house. That will never happen! You won't get me for that. I will not move away from your feet! Do you think I will ignore you? Enough of it. They are all coming! The house has to be cleaned for its cobwebs! There are a few lights and fans to be repaired. A few tiles are broken on the eastern side. They are to be replaced. The 3 bathrooms upstairs have to be mended. There is enough work for me! Krishnan! - Did you call me? It's not you, this time. You mean Lord Krishnan! For the marriage? He has married many girls! Come! There is a big tusker there, which keeps quiet! You are after all a cow! You may be the cow of Easwaramangalam... ...but, you need not be so sniff! Who is it? - I am the cow! A cow with 2 legs! - Look! Don't they have four legs? Now, you are on four legs! You have to spend money for that. If you walk with the torch and stick in your hands... ...you will not get this bliss. What is it? - I was asking you, if you are happy... ...with your work, with the torch in your hand? Don't try to give pleasure to me at this small hour! Go and have your dinner which is there for you. I have had my dinner already! Where from? - From the shop! What? - From the tea shop! He has come getting drunk to foul up, the whole place! Why is he with the torch and the stick in this night? Has he gone crazy? When one is not married in time he will get crazy like this. He can not be blamed for that reason! Kutty Sankaran! Your mahout is coming drunk! You have very clean habits! Don't stamp him, when he falls on your feet. He has got drunk heavily! You chew it and eat well, and try to get some sleep! If you listen to him, and do anything to harm me... ...I will hit you, with the gaud in your ear! Man was born from the monkey! What has elephant given birth to? lts bowels! Only bowels! Nothing has created other than that! Tell me something! Didn't you tell me that, the tiles has to be changed? If you telephone him Mayin will send his man from the market. I don't need anybody for that work. He will only break the rest of the tiles! Do you want to climb up the roof? - Nothing will happen to me. Look at this. Allow it to boil a little more. Has it not boiled yet? It's a tricky one! It will look as the normal rice. It will look as if cooked well when actually it is not. It will be hard when tried. So let it get cooked up a little more. Are old news papers, bottles, and tin for sale? Will you buy anything that is old? Of course I do. - She is the one! Will you take her? I will give you money for her! I will not take up anything that is alive! Then come now and then! She is almost ready for that! Mind you! Sankaran Kutty Nair is up to some danger! I have told him to bring! To bring danger? What is it Januamma that noise? A plate fell down and got broken! It has to break! It is him who comes! She is the one I said. When everybody comes, she has to be there to help in the kitchen! I told her dad, to send her to Koloth for help! He immediately agreed to it. I have brought her here. Is it? - Why? That is good! - Isn't it? - You have very prosperous legs. The moment you stepped in, a plate fell down and broke. My bad luck isn't the matter of today or yesterday! What is it to have to do with her? It's him who is to blame. Come in. What is your name? The landlord was very fond of her father! You might have heard of him! His name is Anantha nallore Kunhirama Poduval! He was an expert in drum concert in those times! He's been laid down for the last 5 to 8 years for epilepsy! Her sister's husband is so cruel that he got the house... ...and field in his name by force. His reason for that was he has spent enough money... ...for the treatment of her daddy! Now, the dad and the daughter are at his mercy! He is a lorry driver! A nasty fellow! He don't consider her, as his sister in law! Poduval lamented that it is better she stayed at Koloth. She need not have to be scared of the brother in law... ...when she can have her bread to survive, that way. Selfish! He will taste the good and the bad of what he does. There will be many people in our house enough for a feast from now, onwards! Can you manage them, all alone? So...! - So you have decided on your own! You haven't asked me a word before that. You asked him to bring her here. He has brought her all of a sudden! Don't tell me anything! I thought it will be for your help, that's why! I don't want anybody to help me. I know, you don't need anybody's help. If it is a help for herself? She is very much suffering there. She is willing to take whatever we give her. I took a decision without asking you! It's my fault. We can drop it, if you don't like it. Send her away. I'm not worried that she will go off. I'm worried that... ...you are sulking Come, get up! He finds asylum at the steps of the pond... ...when he is annoyed as the proverbial lizard on the fence. You should bear it in your mind that you have come to work here. Don't behave as if you are the landlady later! Understand? Then take your bath before entering the kitchen! Do you have the habit of getting up early in the morning? My mother have died when I was very young! My dad has brought my sister and me up, in a disciplined way. He used to tell us that, we should finish our kitchen work ...after shower and prayer before the sunset. Just answer me the question I ask you! I don't want any of your stories! I thought you were the master of this household... when I saw you, the first time. Your stance, profundity, and your blush were so impressive! Aren't we of the same department? How big is this house! Who owns all this? Let that be anything! I only have to take care of my work! How many tuskers are in this house hold? It is the only one standing here! Not this one in the shed. I mean those, which are gone out! Are you a fool? - My name is Rajappan! So what? I will call you as Rajappan the fool! Or else, I will call you as Pongappan in short. I am Govindan, the mahout of this household! I heard that you've come! I wanted to get acquainted with you. Hope you are sweeping the floor. Have you thought that I am dancing with the broom stick? I like your joke very much! What's your name, child? I have no child! I'll tell you, when I have one and christen it. It's a joke! You are joking again! You are supposed to do the sweeping! Instead you are telling tales! I can sweep the floor! You don't have to instruct me. What is it? - I didn't say anything. The floor will not get hurt! Don't think, the floor and the broom will get hurt... ...if you press harder, and sweep. Kutty Nair is to be rewarded, to discover you... ...and to send you here. Give me that. Hold the broom like this... ...and sweep like this. Understand? - Give it a clean sweep, Krishnan! Shall I do that on your face? That is not now. - Have you understood? If you do like this, the rubbish will not go. You could have done that yourself. Why do you want to bother others? What is it? - I haven't said anything. You could have kept someone, who knows the work. See how she has done the work! They are youngsters, of this time! Her tongue is like the broom to add to it. Is it the way you wanted? Will you do the same way as I show you up? It is called the monkey's birth. It is that. I've come again. - You mahout?! Do you owe him anything? - He owes me 50 Rupees! Don't try to mingle with him! He is not normal! Don't you have any work other than coming in rounds in cycle? We are undergoing relaxation treatment. Who? - The elephant, and me. You tusker! Are you okay? Let me go for a noon show! Move! Move away! Will you get ticket now? I have no money with me! If you could lend your knife, I can manage myself. What's the use of shaving? The beard will grow again! You, Nair! When did you start this work of yours? What work, do you mean? This shaving job is not mine! It is his job. Are you laughing, you dog? Who did you ask, before getting the girl out with you? I asked Anantha nalloor KunhiRama Poduval... ...who is her dad! Who else, should I ask that you think? Kunhirama Koduval, damn it! It's not the drummer, lying like an old torn cloth... ...it's me, who is the bread winner. You should ask me first. Understand, you ass? Manikandan! Leave that man! You are only a worker at the Koloth! Where do you come in this? Consider this also, as a part of my routine work! You go from here. Leave him and go. Who are you to send me off? We all are born in this land! We know each other very well. Why do we need a tussle then? You can go now. - I have something for you dog! Let that ripen and become fruit! You get away from here, will you? He caught hold of my throat! Have you seen him? It's at his feet that girl is living. We call it in Malayalam as a pain in the neck! Don't you know? - You can say it boldly. Hearing that sage Kouthaka questioned son Sudhan At which ever time on whose so ever instruction ...from which ever place for whatever reason... Said the sage... He reads it now because he was taught when he was very young! I want to hear him, chanting! Don't interrupt me! It's when I chant Bhagavatham, you do your fondling! You can chant now. Sage Aadharayanan scripted Bhagavatham. She says she has learned to dance and sing! Won't you permit me to chant this? Ok, I've stopped. You can go and watch her dance! I can't now. You're inclined to go after her, since she came here. You seem to ignore me! What did you say? You said I ignore you! Tell me that again! Mom doesn't like me. I repeat that thrice. That is like you! I was only joking! Why are you geting annoyed for that? This mom's heart is gold like! Like the Basil of the courtyard! When I come before you ··· I am like a calf. Wearing new dress with folded hands When you give Vishu gift to me... My eyes would well up I would fall at your feet This Mom's heart is gold like! Like the Basil of the courtyard! Like the Basil of the courtyard! When you applied vermillion on your forehead. It was like a sunrise in this face those days! In this loving ocean where affectionate tides rise... ...would yield shells always and would shower benevolent pearls! Are you not the moon of the Onam festival? Are you not the fragrant flower always? Whoever you see are your children! I am also your beloved dear Always your beloved dear! This mom's heart is gold like! Like the Basil of the courtyard! Like the Basil of the courtyard! There is an assuaging smile in dream. There are caressing birds too! There are beloved calves for mom's company! To ferry across the banks is a moonlit boat! All houses and entire village is with you! Although there are many I will also be with you! Day in and day out I am with you as a shadow! I am always with you. This mom's heart is gold like! Like the Basil of the courtyard! When I come before you ··· I am like a calf. Wearing new dress with folded hands When you give Vishu gift to me... My eyes would well up I would fall at your feet This Mom's heart is gold like! Like the Basil of the courtyard! When I come before you ··· I am like a calf. I am like a calf. Take that phone dear! Who is it? - I... - Is it Easwaramangalam? I am Malavika here. It's Maluchechi! She is our new maid girl! Gowri! Why didn't you call me yesterday? I was not here in Delhi yesterday. There was a seminar in Calcutta! I've told you about that. It was late when I came back! Is there any news? There is news here. Didn't Sudhi call you up? Everyone is coming here for the summer vacation. When are you coming? I am not sure about that. I am very much busy here. Enough. You write only in paper about the house hold... ...temple and the pond! You have to come and see once a while and go. I've only that to say to you. Are you annoyed? Let me see mom. Ok, Malu! - Ok. Convey my inquires to all! Shall I disconnect then? When she said that it is Malavika in the phone... ...what shall I say... my whole body was... I have only read her books she wrote in the library. I have not seen her in person. I have only seen her photograph. How is she writing the stories? Will she think about them and write it? She don't write stories before. She wrote them as stories what she heard and saw... ...in the near and around her. That were her stories and her poems! She has aquired everyone's hatred... ...because she has written about the family and the family matters. - Hatred? - Don't ask me. You read these, when you get time. I am leaving the Champak shadow alone... The flowers, grass temple and wind of this place He wanted all these Still listening to the inner voice I am going away alone! Leaving my Kannan alone Do you have your exams tomorrow? Exams are over! Don't you know that? I am checking the answer papers of the students! What? - I didn't say anything! Switch off the light and go to sleep! You! Why do you yell? I have a name I have read that name a number of times in this book. Not only in one, but in many books. I leave my Kannan alone and am going all alone. Krishnan is Kannan. Kannan in this is you. Isn't it? You may look without wounds... ...but that does not mean that you are mentally normal! After reading Ramayanam, you may ask me if I am Lord Raman! The Lord Krishnan in Mahabharatham... ...will seem to you as me, if you read that. It is not about the Lord Krishna in Bhagavatham I asked you. I was asking you, about the Krishnan in this. Will anybody eat the raw jack fruit? It is a treatment! Mom used to say that you will be virtuous if you feed the elephant. You will be virtuous if you feed the mahout too. It may be little more, if it is girls who feed me! This is for the tusker. - It's the same if it is me or the tusker. We are one soul, even if we are two bodies, physically. ...are you not an elephant? I have a craving for something since I came here. You are young and that is natural! Rayappa, Go! Tell me, whatever it is the craving! Tell me. You may be shy to tell that at first. You will get on with it. What if I climb on the back of the tusker? That is a good idea! - Can I climb on it? Why not? The tusker is just for that. You've to offer 101 Rupees! It is for the elephant Gods, and you can climb then! 101 Rupees? - You don't have to give it at once. You can give it instalments, when you get your salary! One more thing! When it is time for food... ...give me food, as much you give to the elephant! The other servants, do that here for me. Look at the scars in the bum of Janamma It's because, she often mounts the elephant! She won't disclose it if you ask It is a secret! Don't tell anyone Especially, our head master Krishnan. He is not to be seen anywhere here. I took the opportunity to come over here. He is of that kind. He appears and disappears at his will. Sometimes, I wonder if there is one like him. It is a an old palace and there will be evil souls like him. This is a good chance for you! Mount it! Don't be scared! Imagine 101 Rupees and the senior mahout in your mind... ...hate your second mahout and close your eyes, and pray! Open up your eyes and watch the scene! Like that. Can I get down now? Don't you feel joyous? This is called joy of the elephant. What nonsense are you doing? Aren't those the chieftains? Get down. How to get down? What is all this? Where are you up to? - I don't know. What is this fool hardiness? Do you promote elephant rides... ...in the premises of the palace? She is a poor girl. Are the poor now on the back of the elephant? She must have somehow got on its top! You mean some how, she got on top of it? Will you get down? This is the gambol of Govindan! Where is he? - He has vanished. Where has he vanished? - I don't know. Climb down, you! Climb down! place your leg on that! She's an ass with no brains! You tusker should've some brains! I did know about that. - I did not say it you. I was saying that, to the tusker! Get down. Get down you ass! - I'm getting down! You've done the mischief and... If I see you again anywhere, other than the kitchen... ...you won't walk on two legs! She is the a maid servant here. She has spoiled the thrill of this occasion... ...when everybody is gathered here. Come It is this place, that suits you well! You have nice breeze and light here... ...the view from the top! This place has high spirits! There's nothing to worry about young children! They won't be able to climb up the steps! Are you telling us, that we have no luck of any issues? I didn't mean to say that! Why don't you pay a visit to Trivandrum? Why don't you come there once? It's not that, I have no craving to visit my hometown! I have the urge to return back soon. I hate the travel. Whether it is the train or the bus! There is a stink in the train! The bus is a bit noisy! It's safe to be here which is comfortable. - Come children! - We could not start in time siter! You've come and that's enough! Deepa and Tarun! Do you know, Krishnan uncle! You know the names of the children... ...who are brought up in America! - Then what? I know by heart, every body's name and birth date... ...of this household. Stop your sweet talk and bring and keep the luggage in. Watch it. There are things which are breakable! Are these bombs to be careful? When you said that there are breakable things... ...he just cracked a joke! Joke? If his face is smashed he will understand. I think Shoba likes America very much. For children's education, future and for everything... ...America is the ideal place. Once we are out of America the children... ...don't like even Ernakulam! Let alone this jungle. We are born and brought up in this jungle, after all! Let the children see these places! Has Sudhi not arrived? - He is the promoter of this gathering. He has not arrived yet. Brother in law! I wanted to contact you as soon as you left Trivandrum! The mobile is switched off, and the land line is fully engaged. What can I do then? When the arrack is banned off... ...the bar has only its name! All shops started selling arrack! I am fed up of this toddy business! He is'nt fed up of liquor business, but counting the money! Have you come sir? - They have come en route Tripunithura! I came along with them. Haven't your eldest son Jithu come? He called us to say that he has arrived in Delhi from Nigeria! He will have to meet some of his friends there. The room upstairs, is arranged for those, from America! Do the children need hot water for bathing? - Who is he? He enquires as if like a cheap employee of a lodge! They certainly it idiot! Won't those heaters work here? They are from America. - We are still in Easwara mangalam! The madam only needs some hot water! We will boil it on the oven! The bill for electricity is heavy! I doubt a couple of heaters are on repair being not in use. Stop your big talk and see if you can find out any technicians. See him? Why do we need him? Looks like a buffalo and eats stomach full! Says he has a doubt! He is scared of me since long time. If you go sight seeing and mount the elephant... ...the rice will be overcooked! Understand? It may be overcooked! - See that it is not. Does any grooms want to see you for marriage? Your face look gloomy! They should have to come together! How can we cook every now and then for one that comes? If anybody comes any more we will have to starve. This is their house and the food is for them! We can have their leftovers! What do you have for the feast? I doubt if she will die before the feast is ready! Do not have any doubts for you. She'll die only after attending the funeral rites of many. The children want Krishnan to be with them. Ofcourse they want somebody of their age! Your joke is not humorous as before. That is what I want to have something now Yes of course, you have to survive! Did those vegetables tell you... ...to cut them softly that they feel painful? Don't look like that! The people will mistake you! Krishnan! We will take care of that. You move away. Is it Urmila? - That's right. You should not muddle up the currys that you cook? Let them be not like the western curries! The men over there would not like them and I will get a bad name for me! We may be coming from the city... ...but we are those from here. Gowri need not have to interfere in this and waste your time. Understand? Your habit is like that. Don't delay the lunch till the supper. Poor girl! She is scared of me. Get some cold water to the room on the North side. Ambika! Can you come here for a moment? Open up the box and get a bottle from that. At this afternoon hour, when all are standing here! Go and ask them to sit somewhere. Go and bring it I said. Here comes an advisor! - Poor Ambika aunty! He treats her as if to a dog! You mind your own business! - That is true! Let them do what they like! - There will be joyful moments in the beginning! - Then it is one's own way. Do you know brother in law? Kutty Sankaran is not up to the mark now a days. Even Rajnikant do not have his name as before! Let alone a tusker. You're wasting money on this elephant. Are there any other benefits from that? There were 5 to 8 tuskers in this courtyard once! Now we have only him and he is a must for us. The tuskers have no resale value now a days! He is gone weak and old! He has no problems as such. If he stands in a gathering he has the same valor! You people eat well and drink well! That is not enough. You have to watch the elephant. The ants are tiny and they need to be watched well. We can see the elephant at the first sight! You have a long tongue for you! My tongue grew up along with me! Would you like to have some? Drinking at the Koloth is sinful! When you the chieftains of this house hold offer me a drink... ...and if I say no, it's another sin. Wonder, which sin I should commit! Commit the second one delightfully and... ...that is your wish in your mind. Pour it now for me. That is for the chieftains of the Koloth. Kutty Nair have some trivial relationship, with them! Don't get greedy and mind your own work! Don't walk before them chest open! They will eat you up with the liquor! Let them finish and leave the place. There are more people to come! You will have to work harder! Let it be. I'm happy to do that. I can sleep well here peacefully... ...after finishing my work without being scared of anyone. My sister's husband is supposed to be my brother! On the other hand he treats me in a malicious way! There's nobody to ask him. That's why. You go and have your sleep, dear. Let me finish this. Keep it and go. Get off. Don't you get me? Go away! It is late night. Januamma will do the rest tomorrow! Haven't you gone for sleep yet? Your legs will go limp, if not. The guests will return to their homes! We will be the one who have to endure that. Have you eaten up? - Not yet. Let me finish it. In the midst of the guests I have a feeling that we are separated. It's only for a few days! We've to see that the guests are taken care of. I wonder if they relish the food and the curries! Won't it be enough if you do the cooking? Mom can go and sleep! Please go now! Elephants are ungrateful! They will stamp the mahout to death at the end. If you do that to me, you tusker... ...I will stab you and kill you. They have come! - Grand ma! Come my dear chidren! come. You could've started a bit earlier. Their sleep has been spoilt. They sleep only late. Is it Jaysri? The city bred children do this! Hello! - Uncle has come earlier than me, is n't it? We were waiting for you till now! You could've called us up when you tend to come late! You uncle, know how busy I am? Let me tell you something! - Don't you want to have food? We have eaten, on our way here. Why did you do that? We have prepared the favourite sweet dessert for Sudhi! You have put us against a wall. Dessert at this small hour? Go away from here. He is like the dog in the cartoon strip "Boban and Moly"! He is seen everywhere! There is no privacy for us here. You come! Has everyone gone to sleep? Who are you all? - Are you servant here? Which is my room? Are you not Chithu, Aniyan uncle's son? I could not recognize you! You have changed a lot after being in abroad for studies! Are they returning without eating anything? They are being fed well. If you like you can have a couple of drinks. I don't need it. Give that bag to me! I will show your room! It's in upstairs, and come with me! It's very much true that the chieftains of Koloth are atrocious. There is a big tusker here which has no work at all. The poor girl has enough work load here. Don't give all this milk to those chieftains here. You can also drink some of it too if you are tired! The employers can thrive only if there are workmen I can take care of me! You can go and mind your work! You have no class awareness! What is it there? I was giving her the milk! Gowri! What is the problem here? Keep the milk inside! Don't act like Krishnan! I will have it later, I had some! Your job is to milk the cow only! Don't milk the workers! We have only talked about the matters of milk and that's all. Talk the matters about milk only, to the cow! I am here to talk to the tusker and the female workers here! Do you understand that? You can go now? Go home and domestic chores! You have no class awareness and you will face the aftermath. You have come so early from Palakkad! Workers work on our fields and we've a lot of problems there! How is your medical college studies? - Isn't it your second year? I'm in the third year! - She studies well alright. I have just enough time to manage the money for the fees! After 5 years when she becomes a doctor you'll have... ...enough money to count! Sekar in law! You are coming late when you are very near! You should have come early! You would have been in good mood then! He will be in good mood anywhere, if there is liquor! Where is Krishnan? These bags should have to be taken in. Is nobody there? - It's better if one takes his own box. You move elephant! The ass of Krishnan is not seen anywhere when needed. Though we are from Koloth we are not that rich. Isn't it dad? We can't expect much! Won't you keep quiet, Renuka? Take these boxes children! Uncle has come only when my husband has died. You are a busy man. Let that be like that. I get all information of you! Have you hinted it out to the mom? If we tell her all of a sudden... Devettan's coming alright! Won't it be fair after he comes? It's likely that Valliattan will also come today! Shall we not, after he has come? I'll manage that. Mom has to know that one day or other! Why do you smoke like this? We are after all your elder sisters! He is annoyed that he has not won any game! It's a hat trick! Have you come here for the vacation... ...to earn money playing cards? What else does she do in America other than playing cards? Please sit Jithu! - No. He is ashamed to get defeated at the ladies hands! He and his muscle! Stop the play! Stop it! Valliattan has come down. How much I owe you? - I told you, that I don't know Hindi! I asked you how much is the fare? - 280 Rupees! It's 280 Rupees! Give that to him! 280 Rupees? My God! In Ahmedabad, it will be only 100 Rupees at the most! We are at loss! Balagopalan! - My dear brother! We have lost our make up box! The dirty train has looted our make up box! I have one with me! If you want it, I will give you mine! What is the matter? - She says that, she has forgotten her... ...make up box in the train! Do you need it, even now? You are still in that mood! Kutty Nair has come at the station! Everybody was worried that you were not to be seen! They have called me from Ahmedabad and asked me if you have come. What happened to you? I fainted when the breeze of Kerala has hit me! I didn't know that you are there to alight! Where is Krishnan? When did you arrive? Leave me uncle. My body is full of mud and sweat. I like the smell of this mud and sweat... ...and I like to walk on this soil... ...bearing the wind, rain and the sun! I have to be virtuous for that! You have that virtue! Who else have come with you? There is my wife. My eldest son Aniyan's daughter Pooja is also there. Dear! I need some hot water to take a bath. Understand? - She said she wanted some hot water to bathe. I can understand Hindi little! What did you tell him? I heard her, say to him to go! I saw him going off then! If we were bit late to come what would have happened which I don't know. What will happen then? I told them, that I know a little Hindi! That's all. You should have told it in Malayalam! Why should you tell that in Hindi? They asked in Hindi I replied in Hindi. That old man had no objection to that. Old man? Is he a young man then? You have a sharp tongue! Who do you think he is? He is the elder brother of the deceased husband of the lady of this household. The elder brother of this household! You won't see a teak wood, in this place as old as him. You should behave very politely and caring to them! You should not call him an old man! Then I have a name for him to call. What is it? The cage in the wind. The other one is Mother cage! When you stamp there do you find any difference in sound? No. Try here! I'm weak. That's why I wanted you to stamp here. What's this? Are you practicing break dance? You can tell that to others. It is a secret not to reveal! What is that? The ancestors used to bury treasures in palaces like this... ...noble houses and large house holds. What is a Nidhi? It means treasure! It has become trouser only now! It was Nidhi when it was buried! Is there treasure, in this house? I've heard it is there when I was young! I'm sure it will be there. I was stamping for long to find out if it is there. I have been stamping the entire house... ...and I feel that, there is a difference in the sound here. The treasure will be here. Why don't we dig here and see? Come there. We have enough fun there. We are on treasure hunting here! We were watching live the Peruchazhi(Bandicoot)hunting there! What is a peruchazhi? The bandicoot is the player of the opposite team of Krishnan uncle! There will be a game between them on the roof now and then. It is long time since your play of yours! It is gone! - It is there for long! If I chase it out, it won't go. I will see that he is chased out from this place. Krishnan! Will you come here for a moment? Devan! You look as if you have become dark! It is not the medicated breeze of Easwaramangalam... ...which is the God's abode that I breathe there. It is not only my color, it is the vigor too... ...that will get perished! The city is meant for people not to survive but to die! It is in the polluted air of Bombay city that my health... He has started it. - It's a surprise, you are here! Kalyani dear! Take up the box. Step into the porch of Easwaramangalam, the God's abode... ...with your right foot. No need of it. Devan! He is Krishnan! He may be Lord Krishnan Lord Vishnu orLord Brahma! I know how to do my things. You have grown up! - Kalyani! Krishna! Hare Krishna! Are you shocked? A shock? I might have vanished! Human beings need no time to change. That's human beings! We are Devan and Lord Krishnan! Why should we change? Weak signals! That's good in a way. It will not disturb me, any more! Lock it in the wooden chest till I go back! Let it be silent hereafter! Mom! Has everyone come? They have gone to Guruvayyoor temple You've come late. For me, Guruvayoor, Banaras, and Rameswaram are here. I want to get rid of these my attires first. We will call Kunjan of New Bombay Saloon! Then I want to fly in these fields... ...as a simple man like you! You got scared? - Here it is. He won't make noise again! I wanted to leave Bombay when Girija died. I stayed back because of my daughter's studies. A good part of my life was spent in this big city. In other words, the city gulped away a major portion of my life. When you have a very good job there why do you...? Even after my death, The Times Of India and my job will be there. Some one will sit in the chair where I was. After 2 to 2 1/2 years, I will leave everything... ...once for all and come back. Then I will lie down watching the moon like this. You should not just watch the moon! You have to say something to it. Where is that folk song heard from? Do you remember Velayuthan? He used to climb trees nobody can, like a monkey. When he was about to climb the tree... ...You attached a tail like thing to the back of his old trousers! Poor thing! He was not aware of that. The kids called him a monkey! He was being called a monkey from then on! Yes! Our Velayuthan! He is mad now, since long time. How does it happen? - Who knows? Why do people get mad, why do people die... ...and why are people born? I have no idea about that! It is that Velayuthan who sings! Leave that matter! Why don't you sing these days? You used to sing songs on occasions like this! It was washed away in the last flood time. You might have preserved a little on the roof of your mind. That bandicoot has eaten it away. A little now from that! - Ok. I'll sing then. I am ready then. Raman is an epitome for battle. Sita is an epitome for family.

There should be grand fire works at the... ...fare well occasion of our guests! Can you tell Devettan Thampuran to get me a job... ...in a big saloon in Bombay? Why do you need that? Does grass grow on head of our people? ...These are the heads of localities. I can cut the hair of Amitabh Bachan if it is there. Do you think, that the hair is original for the actors there? It is all duplicate, man! You can not cut it as you like. It may look like real hair! It is all camera trick! See Krishnan! - It's not C. Krishnan! ...it is just Krishnan! - Just Krishnan! Tell me what do you want? Won't the elder Varma come out? I came up to the gate yesterday! I saw you glancing above the gate! Why didn't you come in then? - You were standing at the courtyard! If not, you would snatch uncle and go. We are friends, aren't we? I am so eager to see him! You come and see him when he is alone, free! I will tell him. - Thank you very much! Just a courtesy call Just two slokas and few steps that is all! No this thing! That won't be there! Krishnettan! - Has Malu come? I thought you will come to receive me at the gate! You are standing here instead. I wanted to keep these things, have a bath and wait for you! I didn't expect you to come so early! The flight do not take 2 days to reach here from Delhi. It is not like your visit to the market. Mayanka! Maruthan uncle! Are you keeping fine? Hasn't he come? This place will lit up... ...only after your arrival! The children told that you have written about us in a book! What else, can I write other than about you? You keep going! I am on my way! He enjoy carrying those, and do hard work. Mangoe has to be eaten with salt. Don't eat all of them, you kids! Dear! Uncle! I've seen your face in the television only! I have forgotten seeing you, in person! You are not on earth since you have come here. I'm enjoying life here for the last few days forgetting everything! I bid goodbye to the phoney literary newspaper business for the time being. Mom! - Malu! Saraswathy madam has grown fat! Isn't it, sister? Do you have only this bag? I don't want to take anything from here when I return back! I leave everything here. When I saw you at the market place... ...I felt you looked a little weak! It may be because I am tired after travel. You came here only in the flight from Delhi instead of walking all the way! There is a lot of people here, with all these children... ...relatives, and others, fit enough for a procession here. Get down here and be happy, and joyful with heart open! You are very greedy! - It's long time, since I had this taste! I haven't eaten anything since morning! I didn't like the food packet given in the flight! I did not even open up the packet. Will anyone feel like having anything in the sky? Won't you be scared? I've never got into a flight. Please see if there is the special pickles... ...which Krishnettan prepared! It is kept in the jar. It'll be ready only tomorrow! When all are waiting here, you are having food... ...with out any manners! Isn't it Malavika? She won't mind about others! She does everything to her accord, and later tell that to everyone! She fondly calls it a story and novel! What happened then? It gained only a bad name for the family. There was an article in a special edition, these days. I do not read all these! - How do you know if they are good or bad... ...if you do not read them? The people know everything! They are only stories, aren't they Renu? It's the writer who says that they are only stories. Those who read them, will take it very seriously! The stories about Easwaramangalam also were taken seriously! How can I be with a man who hates to look at my face? He is educated, having a good job and is from a noble family! Everybody liked that. I thought it was your good fortune! It's now...! - I don't have any regrets for that. I've started to realize now why I should live in an alien place! To hell with my job in the embassy. What if I don't go back, mom? It's too late to tell your stories! Malu can go and sleep now! Some of the kids are sleeping in your room! Should I take them from there? - No need. I am sleeping with my mom tonight! Ok, then. All the rooms are lit up. Nobody switches them off after use. You'll have to manage a heavy electricity bill! Let it be anything. It is only a matter of few days! You don't have to tell anything! I certainly won't tell. It's their property too! Why Janardanan is here, at this time? Haven't you slept yet? Have you come here thinking I am asleep? I need some chilled water to drink! Don't bother to get it, if you are asleep! Won't it be difficult for you? You have more brains than me! You have to only mind your brains. Why do you behave strange to me? I've been seeing your dirty tricks since we were very young! You may go! I will bring the water to you! Buffallo! Can't you close the door and sleep? I got the joker! That is good! If a spark falls some where it would be a catastrophe This will game will mar the house's prosperity This is forbidden in a house... That too in the midnight! Don't you feel sleepy at all? If it is time for you to sleep, you can go ahead! Are we children to make us, go to sleep? Balan uncle! Are you in this crowd? This gets me, in some good mood! There is a temple of Lord Krishna... ...beside this, where we follow up regularly the offerings and prayers. It is the deity who looks after the house hold and us! Why do you want to do things which are forbidden ignoring the glory of the lord? It is the dad's grave nearby, where a lamp is lit each evening! We may not able to see him! He can see us and hear us from there! You are from the city and you may not have belief in this. You should not put those minds to suffer who have belief! Stop your drinks and play and go to sleep. Are you trying to rule us? You are a servant after all. Don't beat children. - How did he raise his hands then? Do you know whom you have hit? Do you know him? - They all know They have hit a servant! Don't he have the right to do it? I deserve this. I should not interfere in matters which have no bearing for me! He has come from very far, by spending a lot for the flight expenses! I am a fool, to explain him how expensive it is to spend the... ...electricity here, which is a petty thing for him! All I have to do is to clean up the leftovers and cigarette butts. I deserve it and I could learn things from them! There was nobody to beat me in my childhood. The father and the mom here thought I have nobody! I understand now! Things will be ok from now on. I need this for me to realize! I can't hear anything. It's the corner there for their mobile coverage! The radio station of the mobile phone receive the sound sends there. Let me get my mobile. I'll phone up from there then! You phone from there all the day! We will send up the food for you there! Give those clothes for washing. Looking for the coverage at this age. We will find out the coverage for the grass! After the treatment our tusker has become better! Is n't it? - You too look better! When the tree is watered the plant near it will also be benefited. After the celebration in Uthrali temple, it is the festival in Perambra! There is a gap of 3 days in between! There is an inauguration of a bridge in Tirur! The minister will come. I have accepted that. Then there is a film shooting. One day is enough for it. It should not be known in Koloth. They told to take the tusker only for the celebration! Who has told you? Did the tusker say that? That is the regular thing! I will get some money from that. You know that? Yes! Who? Is it the elephant? It's me, Sankaran kutty! Govindan! What is your height? Am I not tall enough? No. How long is it under you? Why do you want to know all that? It's not that I ask you! How long is it that you grow below the ground? I will disclose your foul play! I have the account which you cheated them... ...for the treatment of the elephant. I will disclose that to Krishnan then! The whole thing will blow up then... ...like the fire works! Walk up, you tusker! Walk up as if you know nothing of any kind. What is it? - The tusker is better now after the treatment. He needs an allowance! It's not for him, but for you! It includes me when it is for the tusker! Take that account book. What expense we have for the tusker? Does it need petrol? This is for him to drink! We are going to Ernakulam. Hotel business is very sensitive. Shall we leave then, mom? Won't you be here in the evening? I want to talk to you certain things when we are back. Weren't you talking things important, so far? You asked me whether I will be here only! I may shift to there, later. Will you mind that? At Pattambi parden and cokenut!! Are there jokes in the account book to laugh at? Let me see that. At Pattambi parden and cokenut plucking expenses 17825 Rupees and 50 paise! At Manniserry on account of yakking! - I might have written it wrong! You have to read it correct. - How is that? For cultivating yam in Mannisserry... What is this then, in Pattambi... For plucking coconuts from the garden in Pattambi... What is the mistake in it? If there is a mistake it will be only in the words! It will not be in the digits. You can see it for yourself. He was sent to school like me, by my dad... ...who bought him slate, dress and umbrella. When it started raining He cried out that he wanted to see mom! Isn't it mom? when there is thunder and rain! He was worried that I will be all alone here. He has managed to get through 3 classes. He became almost an epileptic after non stop crying! My dad then told him to stop his schooling. I became his tuition master instead. I taught him at the house. I let him learn what he wanted, and leave the rest. He has taught me certain things, you know what? It is the cookery! The real cooking. After her mom's death, it was me who was cooking for her to her liking. It was his classes which helped me in that. I don't think it as shameful. If I were learned, I would have to go for work somewhere. You should have to go. Who will be here then? Who will take care for her then? This, my studies are very much enough to look after her. See him? That is Krishnan! Your hair looks nice! You have to maintain it, more better. I used to care for it once. Did you write book "The lonely cuckoo's song" sitting here? Who told you that? - Who do you think it will be? How do I know that? - You know that. You are not telling it. - Who told you that? It's Krishnettan! You used to talk to yourself... ...sitting under the champaka tree. Who has told you that? - It's Krishnettan only and who else? Weren't you really in love? Gowry, you bullock! - He has started it again! She will allow the cows to starve! What are you doing there? This premises where the Kovilakam stands will be more than 12 acres! The actual cost of the Kovilakam is different. The palm grove in Mannisserry where coconuts are cut is of 17 acres. The rest of the ground would be around 11 acres. 57 acres of land is full of matured teak wood and other trees... ...which was acquired from us after torturing us by... ...filing a case, lying that it is only a forest. When it is the property of all we can cooperate to some extent. We have problems of our own then, to solve! Sekaran uncle is with us now. Of course, I am suffering a little now! It was Rukmani's treatment for about 9 years and her death... ...and later Renuka's husband's death in an accident. Those two children are in my care now. It's the expenses for the younger one for her admission in medical field... ...and the expenses for her studies. I can relax a bit, if I could get some money! We are not telling our woes like you! I am Anil Verma of the reputed Koloth... ...but I live in a rented house that too in Bangalore. All are in need of cash! So what? It is easy to demolish! We can't build a house like this. These are the living examples of this century, and the culture! It is like a historical monument! What are you talking? Mahendran! My son in law! That is an apt talk for the outsiders! The professors like you can teach this as a subject... ...history, monument, and the rubbish. It's true. I am an outsider! If you give away my share to me... ...lt's good only for my one meal, and that's all to it. Don't take things that way! What he said was very correct. What you both said is exactly right! Easwara mangalam is to demolish without any damage. It's to be rebuilt in Ernakulam city in a strategic place, near the lagoon! My idea is to construct a heritage hotel... ...under our partnerships! Those are not interested can get his share and go! When Sudhi's father's these brothers... ...were gone their ways it was his daddy alone... ...who has toiled to bring this house hold and the property to this level! Not only that. Your mom's whole lifetime is here. How can they all of a sudden...? You are interfering us, with your talk! You are only seeing things with your eyes! That's why you have such feeling! Do whatever you want! My wife and me aren't against any decision, you make. Mahi in law, please sit. - No need. You can decide your selves. There can be difference of opinion any time. Let it have its own course. We shall go in our ways! I have heard that those cows in Ambadi had... ...good respect for Lord Krishnan! Why are you cows behave towards me, like this? You don't allow me to do anything When you talk with the trees and animals... ...are they talking back to you? All the animal friends of me, talk to me! I talk to them too! - Isn't it children? Did you hear that? Isn't it time for you to sleep? - Not yet. It was saying that its' time for you to sleep! That old moon light, the whistling of the breeze... ...and the songs of the crickets all looks yesteryears! Does any story getting formed in your mind? When I came here I wanted to continue writing... ...where I have left off some time back. Malu will turn Malavika only when you take up the paper and pen. I like the Malu who is a writer. It is a novel. I gave a title to it in the beginning itself! The good tree in my courtyard! The virtuoso tree in my courtyard! Only the good will be virtuous. So it can be read like that. Which is the virtuoso tree in our court yard? This one! You're that tree! Isn't it enough what you got from me? Do you want to repeat your old dirty tricks you both? Don't talk mean of us. - I should not talk... ...and you can do it, both of you. She is your dad's brother's daughter! She is your sister. - Is she? If you read what she has written so far... ...she should be called a tart. You have asked for it at last what I kept with me so far. I was patient so far as you are the blood of Easwara mangalam! Wash your face well in hot water! I have beaten you, with the hand that washes the dishes... ...of you, masters! Don't tell anyone that. You go and sleep. You haven't told anything so far! What's there for me to tell? - It is not like that. You should not feel otherwise, about our decision! Not at all! I want to die here, and that's all I want. Never mind. Frankly, it is for you too that we took this decision! You are getting old. It is not only your household work you've to care. It is your personal matters you have to take care! We can't come and stay here with you! You should come and stay with one of us. What do you say brother? That is only a reason to convince her... ...and to make the world believe that. Whoever took the decision know the truth, in their minds... ...that the property is to be divided, and the Kovilakam... ...has to be demolished and sell it and take the money. Why are you saying all this? - Things are like that, aren't they? I would not have come here for this, if it was for this! You could have handled the entire thing... ...and give me a call at the end. Without your acceptance, how can it be...? You are forcing me for my acceptance, in the matter I dislike. Do you call it acceptance? There are many claimants for this property! Our dad died in this house an our mom lives here. If it continue like this and when other claimants say tomorrow... ...that we children and our mom have kept these in our custody! We should not give any chance for them to say that. That will not happen in any case. It is the property and the money, uncle! We can't say who, when and what they are saying to us. What? - That's why a decision is to be taken about this! After your decision you just show me, where I have to sign in the paper! Isn't that all, for me to do? What uncle? I can't just believe that. There's nothing wrong in not believing it. Lord Guruvayoorappan! Do you know Malu some thing? It was for the climax scene their play and laughter, so far! Kovilakam will be only in our memory in future! Nobody has mentioned about the food yet! I have some how managed to do something for you. What is this conference all about? Why don't you go out for sometime? When we are talking seriously about our family affairs... ...why does a servant come in between and stare? You can go. What Krishnan? You look like a deflated balloon! You are not the same now, after you went inside. I wonder why I was, in a hurry to go in. Have anybody told you anything? - He did. It's our drunkard uncle! He asked what business I have when there is a family meeting! That's true! I should not have gone there... ...like the proverbial dog! Kutty Nair! What is so important that they discuss there? The matter may be great as the household is so vast! I was also waiting for their decision. Haven't you assumed that? - Assume? You should have assumed that. That is your intelligence. - I've assumed it. That is ethics. Ethics of assumption. This is a vast household with lot of boys and girls. I am sure it is some matter of marriage. You are so intelligent, to live in this small state! If you were in America you would have sent men... ...to the sun, to plant a banana tree using your imagination! You should not praise me so much! I will get sniff and will be spoilt. It will not be in your case! I mean to say you've assumed it wrong. The discussion there is about treasure hunting. You mean treasure? - There is treasure in the Koloth. Really? - Let nobody know about that. You need not ask anyone. When they start digging up you've to only join them in digging it. Is that the matter? Why don't you tell that before? Are these lazy plump guys going to dig up for the treasure? Will they get it? They may not allow me to join them now... ...but I will be the only one to do the digging in the last minute. Even you will be only an observer! Let us see! Our life is coming to an end! They are only children! Life has just started for them! They'll have their own needs and their own grounds! When I come to think of it that, everything is coming to an end... ...I could not bear it any more. My fate will be to end up my life in a crematorium in a distant place. Our nostalgia, smell of the soil, sky of Easwaramangalam... ...the moon light, and the stars! These are things that can not be sold! They are businessmen! What business we have to live in this world... ...when we have nothing to sell or buy? I feel an emptiness, before me when I come to think of it. When I came here my mind got distracted again. I was writing my new novel. I have leave that and go. Don't think that way. You have to write. By absorbing enthusiasm from this emptiness and losses... ...you have to write for me. Our dreams and memories are our own possessions. Nobody can cut and divide it or demolish and sell them! You told you will come early morning, and where were you? It is an elephant only and it has to walk all the way here. I see! It's only an elephant! Didn't you get an auto-rikshaw to come here? You have the same haughtiness as before! I am not plucking anybody's hair! I am sitting on the back of the tusker! The mahout will be little sniff when he passes the market place... ...on the elephant back! Walk elephant! Especially the mahout of Koloth is the real one! We will see how long it will be! It is all over! - Are you going to send away Govindan from Koloth? It is time for everyone to come out of Koloth! Why so? - Don't you know anything then? That is going to get demolished. Demolish it? - Everybody in this place knows about that except you. Who has told this nonsense to you? It was Sankaran kutty Nair who told us that. Kutty Nair! - Yes! Is he mad? - It's not any cheer, laughter or celebration, there as you think! They have come to divide the property and demolish the Kovilakam! You know whatever happens there But you don't know about this ...because they have not told you anything... ...if you are not aware of it. I know that you can't bear it! Why do you listen to those, who tell all these? Kutty Nair! Are you mad? - What Krishna! You go and tell all nonsense in the market. The people make fun of me, later. Are you going to demolish the Kovilakam? You are talking rubbish without any license. Didn't you hear this nonsense? It's because... ...he is a relative of here, and an elderely man that I leave him. If not I would have shown him his cure. He didn't say anything wrong! Who is going to demolish the house now? Let me tell you...! - Tell what? About demolishing Kovilakam? It is that. - My Lord! What is this? What happened to you all? There are too many claimants! Who can say anything against it? You are a learned and knowledgeable man! They will listen, to you if you say them. Once it is demolished, nothing can be done then! I will send your profit to each of you very correct to the penny. I used to do that. Have you accepted this proposal? Can you agree to this, like all others? Can you, Malu? Mom! You could have told them your opinion! They will not neglect, if you tell them! Tell them not to divide the property. It's your false notion that I have to take a decision! I am nobody else other than a claimant among many others! A claimant who have no claims! They have decided it those are eligible. So, it is not for Kutty Nair! It is me who is mad! I am so mad, I can't understand what goes on before my eyes. I know nothing and nobody told me anything! Why do you want to tell me all this? All are here who are the claimants! How do you like our place, sir? I didn't expect it to be this big! This front area is to reproduce in the lagoon shore there! It should have to resemble the Kovilakam! There is plenty of wooden pillars for the interior work. We will have enough wood left to build two more hotels! Come, please. Don't just stand staring us. Get us a few tender coconuts! Elephant is the largest animal on land! So its mahout is supposed to be the largest man in the humanity. Do you get that? That is why it is not the work of a mahout. Still I prefer to do this because I am a broad minded man. Famous people are born like this, modesty! You look fairer than those menial chieftains of here. Do you think you are fairer than this tusker... ...hence precious than him? What has happened to your rule which was very bright as a tubelight? All are coming to an end now! You will have only your torch and a stick in the end. Here we have 4 plus 4... 8 plus 4... 12! Then we have 4 large pillars. In the porch, we have 7 plus 7 plus 6... 20. Then 4 numbers of large pillars! Then the doors, roof, beams and thatch... ...the south and north bungalows and the roof, and pillars of them. All are teak and rose wood, and no other wood! The ancestors built this without any knowledge. It is now difficult to demolish it. It needs a special mood! The watchword is to demolish! Drink everybody! Don't just stand there you idiot. Go and prepare food, for these also. You look like the pole of the mahout of the tusker! Come with me to the kitchen! Those are engineers from Ernakulam and they are... ...the people of Sudhi! There is a prestige for the food of Koloth. I am the reason for that. There are a few mangoe fruits here. We will make curry with them. Those engineers will be surprised. What do you say? This is not fair! Are you staring at my beauty? Why are you pretending to me? We aren't attached to each other, yet we two... ...work together here all the day! I could understand something! Is the Kovilakam going to be demolished? Is that important now? You have learned up to 12th class. I have only the knowledge acquired from newspapers! There was a great wall in Germany that later was demolished! It is after all the debris of this house! Doesn't Kovilakam mean anything more, to you? They are the heirs of this land! They have the right to do it. Let it get demolished. Then there won't be anything here, isn't it? There won't be anything here. Then where will you take shelter? Where will you go? If there is a roof over you stand under it. If it is not there, stand under the sky. No one can demolish the sky! It tastes very sweet! If you want you can have a piece. Even you have no other place to go! No one can demolish the sky! You can have a look! There are so many things here! Let us get the list of everything! Then we can fix the value of these items! Krishnan knows all about these! Krishnan! - I am coming. Explain to them what all these, and how many! The large size lamps are 35 numbers. The smaller ones are 56. The hanging lamps are 28 numbers. The broad lamps are 12 numbers. The lamps with chain are 26. When Janardanan uncle built his house and shifted to there... ...he has taken with him the lamps of large size of 10 numbers. He also took with him the smaller size of 7 numbers. We asked about those only which are here. Don't you need the list of those that are taken from here? The shallow vessels of large and small size are 14 numbers! The brass vessels will account to 208... no 217 numbers! Where is the palanquin gone? - It's on the roof! The wooden chests are 14 numbers! The swings are 8 numbers! The chairs, tables and other items will amount to more than 300. I haven't taken into account which are broken. There is an easy chair in the porch used by our dad. Enough of that. Didn't you get a vague idea about this? I will write that in a paper and give you! - Ok! Please come! There are about 4 lamps in the room where the deity is! That is not accounted for! There will be only a few torn papers... ...at the empty carnival ground after the carnival. ...The business is to carry out when the ground is busy! Didn't you get, what I mean? Just ask me what you want from me! Hope you have a tough time at your house! How can it be? Look at me, so that I can say what I have to. This is not anything strange! There were many servants before in this Koloth. Uncle! Leave her there. Once you have escaped unhurt! Don't you feel sleepy now? Who are you to keep guard for her, and watch me all the time? Are you her would be? Get lost, you bastard! Gowry! You can go in. I am a guard, not only for her, but to the household also. I have been dishonored and insulted by you all since long time. Still I gave respect to you... ...and loved you as an uncle! If you get hit by my fist it's a dishonour for the household. Are you trying to threaten me? You should be afraid. The house is full of people. Do you want me to squeeze and throw you... ...before them, and show them, the real you? They may be servants to cook food for you and clean the leftovers! Does it mean those poor girls will strip their clothing at your will? If you behave mean to her any more... ...I will perform a good thing for this household. I will finish you off! You can go now. Nobody have seen anything or heard anything! Don't cry! When you cry it shows you've failed in this. Aren't you trying hard so as not to get defeated? You should try to laugh when you feel like crying. You have to be like that now on. Wipe your tears off. There is God for those are helpless! You have to call us from the air port. Don't miss the flight when you are with your friends. Keep it there and tie it well. Gowri's dad is very serious! Things seem to be pretty bad. He has become ash now. There will not be any feast here. They can leave now those who wanted to. I need to have some sleep. He gave us problems before he departed. Keep this. He made me to spend a lot for his hospitalization and for medicine. I had to cut the mango tree to use it for his pyre! That used to bear a lot of fruits! Poor girl! She is in a bad shape now! It is difficult for us now to get her back with us. How many more days can we stay in Koloth? Have you thought it over? Everything there is priced now. They started selling them too. Among them, what is your value? Did you think about that? Only valuables can be sold. The others are... Leave that now. Your decision to go back didn't fructify, it seems! Mom has told me. It's not necessary to get a life of your choice. Try to live the life what you have attained without bothering others. Make it joyful and merry if you can! Everyone likes to see you smiling! So let us smile for the sake of others! I need not have to tell this all to you! You know everything! Aren't you a writer? - I wrote everything... ...whatever entered my mind. What if others evoke me what I wrote and for my writing? We are in two different worlds even though we live... ...in the same house, in the same room! You've fulfilled all my wishes when we were young! To get the moon, you climbed on top of the mango tree... ...and pointed the pole towards the sky! You then made me greedy by telling me to extend my hands, and eyes closed... ...to catch the moon, that will fall! When Malu grew up to Malavika and opened her heart... ...You turned away from me telling, you are a worker of Koloth. I've closed my eyes till now, for the moon which I have wished for! You had me in your mind, all these years! Open up your eyes now! The views are changed now! It has to be! You will forget the present now when your mind will be occupied... ...with a lot of things which fill your mind in your future. Let alone the moon! You'll have to cheer up! Bring he tusker to our place! You be with him till he gets along with other mahouts. That is the rule of the land! It's not necessary! He is an obedient tusker! He is rebellious only towards me! We have decided to call him Cherplassery Kannan! Wherever you go and what name they call you... ...you are after all my Kutty Sankaran always! You can go. - Shall we take leave now? Come you tusker! Come, walk you tusker! Easwaramangalam Kutty Sankaran! The ball has gone there! Don't cry my dear! I could not come to your place! You should have come only after the last rites! Can I tell to anybody other than to you? He happens to be the father of my kids. She should not stay there. Here, it is like the hue and cry of the people of a sinking ship! Today or tomorrow, we have to move from here! You talk nonsense sometime! We will move from here when it is time for that. You need not push us out from the sinking ship. Till then she could weep without being afraid of anyone! Gowry can go now. - I have only told you what is in my mind. I am so worried. It's not for making you sorry! Who will care for us, whether we cry or starve? Even God is helpless in the case of poor beings like us! Gowry! Have this! Uncle! There is somebody at the front who abuses us after getting drunk! Nobody in Koloth doesn't know about Manikandan! Ask her to come with me! You should not enter a house and start abuse others! Go away! - You get away oldie from me! You will fly away if I blow you off. Ask those fat and foolish chieftains to come out. I will talk to them! Manikandan! Stop your talk and get away from here! I want to talk to the chieftains! Why do you interfere in this, eunuch? We will decide that if I am a eunuch later. I want you to go from here. - If I won't, what do you think you can do to me? Why do you get into trouble and spoil your wellbeing? You are healthy enough to work hard! Don't threaten me away! - Don't do. Come. Don't try to frighten me! Have you readied her, here to offer her... ...to the chieftains when they pay their visit? Aren't you ashamed to do that at your age? Don't. - You. Krishnan! No! If you dare to step in this court yard again... ...You will not have your two legs in future. Mind it. I had to do that to him It's not a deliberate act. I could not control myself. Can't you mom come and stay with us, in Thripunithura? Sudhi is there in Ernakulam which is near to us! The house need not have to be locked when the children... ...are gone to school and we are off for our work! What do say brother? It's mom's idea that is important! She has no likes and dislikes now! She has only to abide to others' opinions! That's what is going on now! You need not have to go to guard anybody's house. I will take her with me to Bombay. There's nobody there except you and your daughter. It is an alien place, language and distant travel. If she falls ill at this age who can come there and to take care of her? We don't want that. If she is in Ernakulam with us there won't be any such problems! That is the regular practice. Mom will stay with her younger son! How is that Malu? She was quite sure of how to take care of her children! We children now are confused how to take care of her. Isn't it brother? You decide what has to be done! Krishnan and I should not be a burden to anyone! We have a lot of servants there! Why do we need Krishnan then? They can't be equal to my Krishnan! You have always your Krishnan! Do you want people to say things here are in control of servants? This is her unwanted haughtiness! He's allowed to stay here being an old timer here. That does not mean that we should take him with us where ever we go. In that case, there are about 4 cows here. If you think you were nurturing them so long can we take them with us? - He is poking from behind! - You're right! He has no investment in this! Whatever he gets is a profit for him He won't leave it. He will bring trouble to us and our mom for that. We will take care of all your matters now on! It is not a servant to do that. Stop it. It's easy for you to sidestep him as a servant! I can not do that myself. I don't care if you are unwilling, but I am not to anywhere without him. You need not have to take me too. What have you told them? Did you say you will not go anywhere, with anybody? Why did you say that? Who is in your mind? Is it me? For whom? Is it for me? You should be with your children! You have to take care of them, and have to get along with them! That is the usual practice! That is the right thing to do! You have to go and that is a must. You mean ignore you? I need someone's consent for that. Consent of the father of my children! He had been to a carnival once. When he returned in the morning there was a little boy with him. A lost and found child. If there were any claimants for the child, we should have send it with them. That was then! Now, he is not before us to ask him... ...if I should discard you. I came here from nowhere! I can go anywhere tomorrow! What stops me from doing that? I will go! I will vanish overnight someday! That is all to it. I am not to be seen, and it is as simple as that. We have nothing more than that. Son! - Don't call me that. Who am I to you? Did you hear that? I am nobody to you, I am nobody to you I repeat it thrice. That's all. Uncle! Here is your enemy! When we climbed the roof to get the ball it was lying there dead. Don't ever imagine such a thing. He has a sound health after enjoying his life here, eating and sleeping. Let him go and work somewhere for his daily bread. That's all to it. This isn't at all a matter to discuss about. It is. We sat here and imbibed what we can from here. He sent the exact money every month in everybody's bank account. He has taken much pain to do that. He deserve to get some share for his hard work. That is the ethics of the world! What Devettan told is very much right. You started your law. I will tell you something! Don't customize socialism here. If that is so, there'd been a large number of servants here. It would be only enough to give them off then. You don't have to give anybody anything. There need not be any argument on that. It's enough if you give him my share how ever modest it is. No mom. There was no need of a discussion about me here. Devettan should not have triggered this talk. You can divide it, within you! You can demolish everything. You leave the tomb of our dad without demolish it! I only need your permission to light a lamp there, every day. That is the only demand I have for you! The children should not sit on the chairs! The girls there have to come fast. Let the Kovilakam glitter in the back ground! We will not see it in future. Come fast Malu! You in law, can sit beside me. You children can sit on the ground. Krishnan! Wear a shirt and join us here. You can also go and stand with them. You could enjoy watching you later sometime! I am not interested. Forget it then! You buffalo can't understand anything I am there in it. Please wait for me. Why has he come in with us? These children or their children grow up in future. They'll point out him and ask who he is in the photograph. Who will say which uncle he is, to them? Should the heritage of this large family be spoilt by that? We don't need any servants in this! Where is mom going to? Please be seated there. Sit there, will you? Please sit mom! All look here! Get yourselves ready! Can you cover everybody? - Yes, I can. Why do everybody have a gingerly face with serious looks? Why don't you wear a smile? You should not pose for the photograph like this. You should look like this. Hello! Come to the back! Breeze from dry leaf do not go away Do not go away beetle in the sun! Do not go far off temple bird! Do not go away banyan leaf sparrow! Affectionate golden deer! Mom's shower ···. Does it not come to courtyard daily? Is it not the virtuous tree in the courtyard? Breeze from dry leaf do not go away Do not go away you beetle in the sun! Do not go far off temple bird! Do not go away banyan leaf sparrow! For long time··· ···we were together in the snow and rain! For long time··· ···we together have played in the river and sand. The soil will blossom at a touch. Did not the folk song girl call you back? Breeze from dry leaf do not go away, anywhere! Do not go away beetle in the sun! Do not go far off temple bird! Do not go away banyan leaf sparrow! The breeze sings the lullaby ...The moon light would shower milk The pomegranate fruit would caress! . Fingers would point to the green paddy fields! The rafters would sob for consolation... ...when appealing to you not to leave Breeze from dry leaf do not go away, anywhere! Do not go away beetle in the sun! Do not go far off temple bird! Do not go away banyan leaf sparrow! Affectionate golden deer! Mom's shower ···. Does it not come to courtyard daily? Is it not the virtous tree in the courtyard? Breeze from dry leaf do not go away, anywhere! Do not go away beetle in the sun! Do not go far off temple bird! Do not go away banyan leaf sparrow! I abandoned you in the middle of road! That is all I could do. These are the medicines for your mom! This is to take in the morning in empty stomach! This is the concoction. This is the cure for the giddiness! This is the oil to rub on the aching joints! When the details are written on the labels... ...why do you conduct a class, then? It is about your health Even if they default... ...you take medication promptly! The concoction may taste bitter. You will have to endure that and drink. Take some sugar candy after wards. Here is your Bhagavatham! Get into the car, mom! It is time! The engineer and the workers will come tomorrow, from the company. Great care has to be taken while demolishing. If not, everything will be a waste then! You must be here then! Did you tell me, that there is treasure in Koloth? You were right. there was treasure here. There is no use, digging for that now! That is gone. There is no more any treasure here. What can this fool tell you? - You buffalo! - Yes! Virtuous tree in my courtyard! Why have you come here? I couldn't be there. That is why... I wonder how I was able to wait till morning! I was determined not to come here and see her! That was in vain, Sudhi. Mom...? Will you give me some work here? I can take up any work. ...lt can be anything like car washing, gardening... ...caring the children or the kitchen work! You know that, I am capable of taking up any work! You need not pay me anything! Only the food has to be taken care of! I can sleep here in the car shed or some where! I can see mom always, when I am here! You know me well since your childhood! I can hold your feet. Can you tell mom, that I have come? It's a nuisance! He has come so early in the morning! It's your mom who has to be blamed. I am getting very annoyed! What shall I say now? He cannot work here or stay here. Since he came all his way to here let him meet mom and go! Ask him not to repeat this again. Mom! Krishnan has come to see you! Mom! Mom! Jayasri! Where is mom gone? Isn't she here? I didn't see her coming out! Where is she then? Her belongings are also missing! Mom! Mom! Have you seen your grand ma? - No. Where is she gone to bring work for others? What is that? Where is mom? Are you asking me that? She is not to be seen here! - Not to be seen? God! What am I hearing? Call up Urmilachi and ask her! She might have gone to Thripunithura! Mom! If she don't have medicine in the morning she will get giddiness then! Her limbs are weak and she may fall somewhere. God! Where will I go and search for her? You are adding to the problems. Will you get out from here? I was looking after her for all these years, as like gold! You can't do that even for a night! I was swallowing fire! Have you come here? I was searching for you all over! Are you doing foolishness not telling anyone? What are you denied there? It's you, who is not there! I could not get any sleep in the night. When you are not at the porch with the torch... ...and your stick I wouldn't get my sleep! I couldn't and I have come here I only want to live where you are! This stone house is left here. It is enough for us, now on! The holy light! The holy light! The holy light! The holy light! I called Gowri with me to be here! It won't be you alone, helping me in future. Am I right? Come now. You can light the oven with your own hands prosperously!
