There won't be any records, they won't know what the hell we're doing. They ain't gonna catch us. -Yeah, but this is kind of shifty stuff, you know, this could get funny. It sounds like stealing cars or-- -This isn't like stealing, it's repo'ing, it's perfectly legal. -Well you saw that guy, he didn't look good. I mean, you know, the cops will be after us all the time or something like that. Who knows. -So like I say, they're never going to catch us. -Well, lets only take fast cars then. I mean, 'cause they can't catch us if we take a fast car. -That's right, we'll only take fast cars. I'll give him a buzz, see what we can get. -Maybe it won't hurt to talk to the guy, anyway. But that-- just see what-- -Just give it a try, if it works it's good. [PHONE RINGING] -Yeah.

You know your beat up truck just might work in this thing. You could throw a couple old lawn mowers and a garden hoe on the back of that son of gun and nobody would never notice. Cruising through Bellaire, looking just like a gardener. OK, here let me tell you guys real quick, what we gotta do. We're picking up a grey '76 Caddy Seville. Now I do this all the time, so it's easy with me. I just want you guys to watch the operation. This guy's never home. He comes up here once a month to pick up his money though, from his family, so. Just watch me operate. But we always get the key to these cars. General Motors or whoever it is, when they sell a car this expensive, they keep a set of keys, 'cause they look for these kind of things. So just kind of watch me, you understand? Mickey, he already know. All right. -Watch this guy. This guy's as smooth as a baby's ass. -Hey, isn't that your car? -Hey! What do you think you're doing? -Come on, let's move, let's jump in my car. Come on. -Uh, oh, looks like George has got a little company. -Little company? Let's get the hell out of here. -No, no, no problem. No problem. Watch this. [CAR HORN] Excuse me. Excuse me. [CAR HORN] -Do you believe you could roll up the windows? -Certainly, anything you wish. -Shit. -Hey, what I tell you guys, there ain't nothing to this repo stuff. -Could we pull over, Mick, I don't feel so good.

Why don't you take her up on it? -This is ridiculous. [POLICE SIREN] [POLICE SCANNER] -Can I see your license please? Could you take it out of your wallet please? You know this picture really doesn't do you justice, Pokie. -The name's Jordan. -You know it's dangerous to drive that slow on these back roads. -Yeah I noticed. There isn't any law against it is there? -See highway safety is my primary concern so, you know I thought I should tell you about it. -Is that all? -Oh I think that's all, yeah, really. -I'm leaving then. Damn, I'm stuck. -Tell you what, let me put some weight on the back bumper, maybe I can, uh, give you some help here. -You think you can do something? -Well let me, uh, you know, let me try it here. OK. Whoa. Whoa. Try it in reverse this time. -All right. -Wait 'til I get up here now. Oh! -Are you OK? -I think I'm all right. -Your leg! -Think I'm all right. -You think you broke it? -No, no. Just an old football injury. -Oh. Oh. -God, I feel terrible about this whole thing. I'm going to call an ambulance. -Oh no. Oh, no. It's really all been my fault. -Are you kidding? I'm the one who almost ran you over. -Look, I wouldn't of stopped you, this would've never happened. I tell you what. How about if I take you out to dinner tonight? You know, to kind of make it up to you. -No, I couldn't do that. -Look, you can trust me. I'm a highway patrolman. -I can't. I work late. -That's all right. I'll pick you up when you get off work. What time you get off? -10 o'clock. -OK great, I'll pick you up. Where do you work? -At the Journal. -I know where that is. I'll pick you up when I get off. -Sounds good, OK. -OK, great. -You take care of that leg now. -Oh, yeah, I sure will. -See you later. [POLICE SCANNER] -That's got to be their house and that's got to be the car. And, uh, that's all. That's all. I don't like, uh, doing this, but that's it. Yeah. -Are you sure you can handle this? -Why? -Well I mean, we can help [INAUDIBLE]. -For two hours you've been leading all around these streets, I don't think you know what you're doing. -Well I know what I'm doing. And you know, well you know about as much as I do. -I was supposed to pick that girl up two hours ago, you know that? -Well maybe she'll like the car or something. You can't take a girl out in this truck. -You sure you want to do this? -Yeah. No. No. But let's do it real quiet. -All right. -Give me the key. -I don't have the key. -Give me the key. -I don't have the key. -George didn't give me the key. -Let's get out of here. -Wait, no, no, we got to get it. We got to get. -Do something else. -I'll hot wire. [DOG BARKING] -God, there's a dog. That's trouble. -I'm getting out of here. -Get up here. I can't do this. -God dammit, [INAUDIBLE], shut up! -Get up here. -Try this. -There's a wire down there. -Is that it? -No, it's a green wire. It's a green on with this thing on it. -I got it. -Well what about this thing? -That's not it. Try the other one. [HORN] [DOG BARKING] -Watch it. OK, try this. Got it. I got it. -Watch that buzzer! -Shit. Push that. I got it, I got it. -Hey your flash light, dammit. -Hey wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'll take the car back. I'm show some style with this car and pick this chick up. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -I'll bring it back in the morning. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [CAR HORN] [KNOCKING] -It's Smokey, the highway patrolman. -Hi, it's Pokie, the girl you forgot to pick up. -I'm sorry, I was going to be early. -It's after midnight. I've been home for two hours. I waited out in front of the office for half an hour, like a fool. -I was coming down Sunset, I was coming-- I was going to be a half hour early, I stopped to pick up this stuff then I was driving along, and my foot locked up. You know my knee I hurt. -Your foot locked up? -It locked up. It locked up. It locked up down on the clutch and I couldn't shift, I couldn't do anything. I had to jam over the curve and I almost hit a Cadillac. And then I was going to get out call you know, and there wasn't a phone for two or three blocks away. And I walked to the phone, and then I finally called the paramedics. And I call the paramedics and I still couldn't walk and they took me down to UCLA and gave me shot. They gave me a couple shots of cortisone. Put some heat on it. It moves a little better now. It used to happen in high school football all the time. And you know, you can't move. I couldn't do a thing. And I was going to call ya, but I didn't have your number. -That's OK. -But I was lucky, see, I had your address, see because I saw it on your license today. So I thought I'd, you know, stop by anyway. And I brought this stuff. I got,uh, I got the wine here. -What kind of stuff? -I got some candy. I couldn't get some good-- I got some peanut butter cups and I got some flowers. -Ah, that's awfully sweet. Yeah, come on in here.

They all say the same thing. -What? -I don't know, they've been on the hot sheet for a week, George. And we checked. And those cars aren't even financed. Who was it? -All I know the guy's name is Lewis. Hey, come to think of it, I picked up those first two, and then he called me to pick up the Seville. And he left the money underneath the door of my apartment. $500. -Well let's go over and see the guy. Where is he? -I don't know where he live.

You didn't tell me this thing had a motor. -That motor's in here? -What do you mean motor? -You just push the red button. -Ah. I thought it was a sailboat. SCANNER: Looks like we got a little cupcake coming up here. Looks like your Smokey friends is coming back. SCANNER: For real. For real, then, one time, Cool Breeze. I see 'em coming right, Cool Breeze. -All right. Everybody out here. Come on out here. Come on, everybody out. All you guys. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Give us a break. -I know you been doing something illegal. This van is county property. -No vans on the sand. -Where does it say that? -Well that's a rule, you ought to know that. -How about a chitlin sandwich? Would you like one of them? -Now, I can go for that. -I never had one. -All right then. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -We're having a little trouble with a couple guys stealing cars. -Oh yeah? -It's nothing to worry about though. -If you ever need any help, give us an old call on the old CB. -We'll let you know when we need some help. [POLICE SCANNER] -Uh, we got to go. -You know, the public needs us. -Yeah. [LAUGHTER] -They need us. We're important, you know. -Watch your step here. -OK, you guys take it easy. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [PHONE RINGING] -Yeah? Yeah, just, uh, just a minute please. Hang on one second. You'll never, ever guess who this is. It's our pal with the $500. -Oh, that's the guy I want to talk to. -Oh, I imagine you problem want to talk to him. -Yeah, this is George. LEWIS: Yeah, this is Lewis. I have another car for you to pick up, but I got to have it today. -That's awful fast, I don't know if I can do it. LEWIS: Hey, for that kind of money I'm paying you, man, I expect prompt results. Now don't disappoint me. -Well, I, I want the money in advance. I'll deliver the car to you personally, OK? LEWIS: I'll bring you the money in person. Now you get it when I get my car. It's a 'vette, license 881-HRP. And bring it to the old wooden bridge on 6th. -Oh, yeah, yeah I know the place. -We'll be there in two hours. Wait there and we'll find you. -OK, I'll talk to you later. -Yeah. -Bye. -I'm gonna nail him this time. Yeah, I'm really gonna nail him this time. I'm gonna meet these guys upstairs here. -OK. -But you keep an eye down here. I'm gonna keep the keys to the car. -That's a good idea. Hey watch your step. -All right. -Hello, Mr. Daniels. I'd like to introduce myself, I'm Lewis Sloan. -I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Sloan. -See you do fast work. I see you got my car out here. -Oh, yeah, it's now who ya know, it's what you know. -Oh, I see. Well let me pay you. Let me get your money here together. Know you been waiting for that. -Oh, yeah, thank you. -Mmm hmm. By the way you have the keys ready? -I got the keys in my pocket, but I think we better talk a little bit before I give you these keys. -Oh? -You think you're gonna have me going around stealing for you, for $500, you got to be out of your mind. Even for $1,000 I wouldn't steal none. -Mr. Daniels, you're in the repossession business. That's what I call you for. You're not stealing cars for me. You're not stealing cars for me. -But I had my people check with the banks and none of these cars are financed by the bank. -Now we both know that there's other people that handle money. The only thing you're doing now is collecting bad-- a few bad debts for me. That's what it's all about. May I please have the keys? -Well, I'm gonna give you the keys. But something about this I don't quite like, you know. -Quite like.
