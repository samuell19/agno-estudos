Filmimaa presents- A Film by Timo Korhonen 29-year-old farmer, admitted into Military Hospital... Patient recalled an incident that shocked him: During an attack, he dived into a foxhole - on top of a putrid Russian corpse. The patient lost his ability to function for a few days. 38-year-old farmer, admitted into Military Hospital... Enemy patrols had been harrassing them continually - so they couldn't sleep. In another incident, they shot two of their own men by mistake. Both the shooters and the killed were excellent soldiers. He had just lain down in his office, - when an enemy grenade exploded inside dismembering his comrade. 34-year-old cobbler admitted... Had to endure heavy shelling, - during which he saw his brother killed close-by. "It felt very bad." Goes on and on about a blood-soaked road - and his brother, whose "head was blown off." Could not give answers any questions. The Wages of War During the Continuation War 191 men were awarded - the most esteemed Finnish decoration, the Mannerheim Cross. At the same time 15,700 soldiers- were admitted into psychiatric care. The trauma experienced by tens of thousands of men - altered the lives of their families after the war. This picture was out every Sunday morning in a silver frame, - flanked by silver candlesticks and candles. Grandma listened to church service on the wireless - while mother paid her respects to my father with the candles. During demobilization, - after coming back from a night at officer's club- he shot himself. Mother told me that during the last months of the war- dad had already been a broken man. He left a short written message on his desk in his billet saying: - "My dearest Orvokki, I don't have the strength to go on." "I've lost nearly all of my men." He felt that he had lost face. That he was unable to lead his men properly. And that's the reason they had high losses. He was a sensitive person. Unable to carry that burden. "Denied burial at a military cemetery" He wasn't considered a hero. Heroic war service was highly valued at the time. There were a lot of men who panicked - in the Valkeasaari breakthrough. In the Valkeasaari breakthrough. I believe dad was proud of the fact that he wasn't one of them. He was taken to a hospital. So, in a sense he didn't run away - from the barrage that led to the breakthrough. In one of his letters, - father writes that his mother, Aino, - had written a letter to him - to admonish him for being in a hospital. I always wondered why grandmother was angry. I believe she was disappointed, - that his son wasn't able to cope with the war. And as she was widowed in the CivilWar of 1918 - on the losing, Red side, - she considered this another defeat and a shame. If you can not fulfill the expectations- and in a sense, lose your manhood and honor- the feelings of shame can crush you. Shame can literally destroy one's personality. Dad was very concerned about- his girlfriend's attitude towards him. He asked her repeatedly, "Can you still love me?" He also said, "Don't tell anyone where I am." "If you do, tell them only that I'm in a hospital." "You have my permission to lie about the rest." Diagnosis: Reactio psychogenea. The rationale behind the diagnosis is not stated. Luckily my mother was empathetic, listened to him - and continued the relationship. He wanted a family. To live a normal life and work. It gave them hope for the future. What I found surprising, - when I read my father's papers from the military - was that they listed a month long convalescent leave. My father had not been injured or wounded physically. Now I know that they were typical for soldiers - who suffered from psychological trauma. Who became deranged in battle. He told me stories from the front. In fact, he told them for several years. Until about 1949 or 1950. Then he stopped. Altogether. Dad seemed introverted, and you couldn't tell what he was thinking. Sometimes I feared that he's going to hurt me physically. Sometimes they told me:"Hannu, you really shouldn't listen." But they were so engrossed in the stories, - that they didn't notice that I was around. There was one story... He had seen how others had tied a Soviet female soldier to a tree- and cut her breasts out. That's a story he told several times. Another story was of a fight where he was the sole survivor. Through the stories I got the feeling - that I had been at the front. He told a story about soldier- who was trapped under a wall that fell on him. They were not able to get him out. He must have seen it with his own eyes. That's bound to make an impression on you. No one had to be present, not even my mom. He went through the events by himself. He told war stories only when he was drunk. And they were always heroic feats. Everyone was suspicious- of their veracity. Since dad told many stories, - I somehow got the impression - that veterans, who never discussed these matters - were the really tough and good ones. He told of a soldier sitting under a tree. This man had packed his gear and was ready to go - but finally simply said... Or rather my dad heard him say: "I'm not going!" And the man pulled the trigger. This soldier clearly thought that he could not go on. "Dear wife, I'm once again going to scribble- a few of lines for you." "We've been chasing the Russkies as fast as we can." "We got so much materiel yesterday- that the Soviets are not going to be happy." "There are dead bodies everywhere." "Makes one cry." "But It really can't be helped." "I can hear artillery firing on the other side of the lake." "It is a comforting sound since I know that- it is meant to beat the Russkies into submission." "I don't think this war will go on for much longer." "Greater Finland is surely about to be born." "Dearest Miss Hannele, I've been busy." "We've fought hard - and liberated many areas in Karelia, - but paid a heavy price for it." "We have a lot of work to do- until the whole of Karelia, including the Soviet parts- are free of their slave masters." "It won't happen without a fight." One inspiring order has permeated the entire, long front: "Forwards!" It doesn't need to be repeated. Men follow it with abandon - to ensure better life for future generations. The same ideal inspires all the branches of the Armed Forces: "For Greater Finland and free Russian Karelia!" "We have to really fight for each square kilometer." "It's almost as if we have to pluck out every Russkie soldier." "Luckily our boys have innate tenacity." "We're not going to leave this task unfinished." My father took part in the attack phase of the war. The advance was really fast, - and events unfolded quickly. His unit Infantry Regiment 6 captured Enso. Enso is burning in the horizon. It is evidence- the Bolsheviks realize how desperate their fight is. They try to avenge their losses by scorched earth tactics. They try to avenge their losses by scorched earth tactics. But they don't realize that their judgement day has finally come. Finnish men will, for their part, see to that. "Finland" and "Helsinki". Two important words. Students will copy them on paper. Nina, Helena and Nastya are learning Finnish letters - for the first time. The name of the new fatherland is written laboriously. They misspell "Suomi"once, and twice. But third time's the charm. That's the beginning of a new life. The time came for me to apply to secondary school. There was a notice in the newspaper - about when and where the entrance exam was to be held. Dad simply said: "Our boys don't go to secondary school." He blocked that route in my life. Parents can make these decisions on behalf of their children - without thinking how it affects the child. He was being selfish. It would be easier for him if I stayed at home. That I would work like a farmhand for him. He was talented in visual arts and played instruments. I have a picture, where he helps me play the violin. When I was a small girl. The fact that he was dead finally dawned on me- when I was about 12. Our house had a ridge roof and an attic. I rummaged the attic really carefully. I found a blue folder. It was fairly thick. It contained all kinds of papers, - including MD's statements and co-worker's interviews. The concluding statement from the MD said - that "clearly the deceased was schizophrenic." I understood what it meant- only after studying psychology in school. Later, as an adult, I have often wondered how on earth - could the MD reach this diagnosis, - since he never met my father - during his lifetime. For the last few ear rupturing minutes - we have been witnessing the actions of the Finnish army- that led to the taking of Karhumäki - in the morning of 5th of December 1941. The patient has been at the front from the beginning of the war- as a tank driver. In the battle for Karhumäki on the 5th of December 1941- he got out of his tank to warm himself up by jumping around. At that moment, he got shot in the right arm. Diagnosis: Gunshot wound in the right elbow. Bullet fractured the ulna in the same arm. Transferred to the psychiatric ward 17.3. Brave in the beginning, but after the battle in Tuulos - Brave in the beginning, but after the battle in Tuulos - was afraid of keeping his hatch closed. He couldn't stand the idea of a sealed tank. His tank had been hit inTuulos. Two other tankmen were wounded badly- and the tank was flowing with blood. Ever since he has had a tick every now and again, - as if in a fright. He was caught drinking twice last summer. Spent 19 days in confinement. Suffered from delusions in jail. He was afraid and was conviced that he was in a tank. According to him, the jail had evil walls. He could hear them whispering. He maintains that he was put in a jail cell - where the walls were moving in to crush his head. When a doctor checked in on him, the walls didn't move. As soon as the doctor left, they started moving again. Received electroconvulsive therapy seven times. Patient has calmed down and perked up considerably. Memory and free recall normal... Not fit for front line service. To be transferred to the 1st Battalion of Neuropathy Convalescents. Diagnosis: Disease of the mind, a person with a diseased mind. Time in service made the disease worse- but did not cause the disease. Not entitled to compensation. The atmosphere at home was always anticipatory. I remember him telling us about the Battle of Suursaari. He told the same stories over and over again. The stories were a bit jumbled and incoherent. I was about 5 or 7 years old. I remember sitting on the sofa. It had green upholstery. I remember following the patterns with my finger. I can remember the color clearly - and the feel of the upholstery. My father was wounded by shrapnel in his left foot. He was put on a stretcher - and taken to a field dressing station. They were following a sandy path, - when they were attacked by a Soviet fighter plane. Stretcher bearers ran into the woods- and my father and another wounded man - were left in the middle of this sandy road. The gap between the two stretchers was 10 to 12 cm. That was my father's estimate. He saw the bullets hit the ground from the strafing. Dad told me that sand was thrown into the air. The bullets passed right in the middle. The plane leaves and the bearers return from their cover. "Wow, you weren't hit! - Yeah, thanks a lot, guys." My father was taken to the field dressing station - and onwards to military hospital. I'm sure many men felt- that they were safe in the military hospital. But that was the beginning of a second war for my father. One MD said: "He simply lacks moral fibre, - send him back to the front." Father's leg was infected and full of pus. It was extremely painful. The doctor took a look and said: "We're going to amputate, take him into the operating room." That's when dad used all his might to get up- and sent the orderlies on their backsides- and told the doctor: "No way are you going to amputate." The doctor simply said: "Well, you are a spirited little man." "Very well, we won't amputate." Dad told the doctor: "I don't mind being sent to the front" "I'm not a slacker." Why did my father have to go through this in the hospital? He was 19-years-old. What my father experienced after the war- was tough as well. My first memories are from the time I'm about three. An older boy called my father "peg leg" deridingly. I could see the confusion in dad's eyes. I looked up at him and then at the bully. He said:"Come back tomorrow and fight." "We'll see what you're made of!" "I'm going to beat you up, peg leg!" I was shocked, someone was threatening my father. Dad simply said: "Did I fight for these punks?" "Is that what I fought for?" Viipuri, the name that makes every Karelians' heart soar. "I'm rushing full speed with our troops towards Viipuri." "You may expect great news shortly." "We're advancing at a breathtaking pace." "May God grant us strength to fulfill our task." "Neighbors" have arrived in the next village." "It is a couple of kilometers from us." "Machine guns are singing their solemn hymns - and transform Russkies into offal." "But that's just the way it is." "This circus won't end until we run out of Russkies." I think that in order for you to kill a person - and pull the trigger, you have to hate him. You can't have empathy. You have to bury your empathy deep inside. You have to act that way to survive. All he did was criticize. You're lazy and passive, and all sorts of things. He put me down all the time. He couldn't stand that someone had will power. Or that someone did something independently. Later he used say that: - "There is only one me in this house, and it's me." If someone questioned that, he went ballistic. And afterwards he couldn't explain to himself- why he was so enraged. One night, when I was five, we had our customary sauna bath. Dad brought in a few of his friends. I was allowed to go into sauna with the men. Of course I noticed that they began drinking. They put the bottle of hard liquer under the bench - as they typically did. Then they went into the hot room - and I remained in the dressing room. I took the bottle anxiously- and threw it out into the snow bank. I wanted to avoid the consequences of drinking. I was afraid of the consequences. When the men came back to the dressing room, I was still there. They looked for the bottle, but couldn't find it. But they had a second bottle in a suitcase- so they opened that one. When we finished bathing, and left the sauna - the men noticed the half-empty bottle in the snow bank. Of course, they realized I had thrown the bottle away. They laughed and joked about it: "Kauko threw the bottle away!" I was so ashamed and felt bad about it. The shame was transferred to me. I was trying to keep our home intact and safe. I wanted it to be a happy and safe home. The story illustrates the mindset of a child back then. What a child was trying to do and what he wanted. When I was conscripted, I realized - that I had hidden skills and could do many things. It built my self-esteem, which had been non-existant until then. I can do things! I have skills! I can do all kinds of things! Without the national service- I don't know what I would have become. Some kind of a worthless momma's boy. In May I saw an announcement in the newspaper: - "Vacancy for an apprentice gardener." "Seppälä School garden, starting 1st of June 1962." "Seppälä School garden, starting 1st of June 1962." I said nothing about it, - since in our family we spoke about things - only when they were about to happen. I put all of my belongings in a cardboard box. Fixed it to my bike and drove out to the bus stop. That's how I left home. My father Matti said to his neighbour: "Our son took off." "But he'll be back in no time like the prodigal son."* He had tried to save face - by saying that "He won't last long." The prodigal son, so to speak, still hasn't returned. I've enjoyed this journey on my own. More than I expected to. If someone expressed even the slightest interest- or even if they didn't, he was ready to recount his experiences. Especially if the person had been in war themselves. We had the habit of sending one of us- to report what part of the story he was in. "He's inTolvajärvi now." He was quite often near Syväri. "The Russkies are coming hard!" Whoever the scout was, - came and told the rest of us where dad was this time. Here's a picture of all the kids and mom. We were six children, and I'm the youngest. My older brothers, who are almost ten years older - remember that dad was a great father - when we were small. But when the boys started to enter puberty- father became more uptight. He could lose his temper- at the drop of a hat. He shouted and raved. Went around and told everyone off. One time, dad came in... We had this large oven near the front door. Dad stopped next to it- and began arranging all the mittens, socks and hats. That was a clear sign that he was about to go off. Our neighbours never once said to us kids - that our father was somehow abnormal. When we once again apologized - for the ruckus- most said that it's understandable. He had experienced all sorts of terrible things in the war. "My dear, sometimes a man gets so confused out here- that it becomes hard to write anything." "In your last letter, you asked for my dog tag number." "It is 982604." "Listen, I can't be bothered to write long letters." "Take care of yourself." "My heartfelt thanks for your letter." "You're the best possible war time pen pal." "You always inspire me." "One is sometimes in need of encouragement out here." "We captured a fairly large village a few days ago." "We're encamped nearby." "The Soviets were thrown out quickly." "They forgot to burn the village." "We've been once again admiring - the wonders of the Soviet paradise." "This village is a sight to see." "It is so filthy and squalid." "This is the beginning of a new era for this part of the world." "To symbolize it, we had a flag raising ceremony yesterday- accompanied by a Lutheran field service." "A place which has suffered godless heathens for two decades- saw our blue and white flag rise up." "Patriotic hymns were sung." "At that moment, we felt that our work was not for nothing." The town of Aunus gets reason to celebrate- the visit of Field Marshal Mannerheim - who came to see the latest town to join Finland. "Greetings from Aunus." "Forgive me for not writing in a long time." "One loses hope, when the war drags on." "It feels as if the war never ends." "Petroskoi is about "We're going to have to fight hard to conquer it." "The Soviets are tenacious." "They won't surrender- and conquering this foreign land is difficult to me." "You told me that Lauri was wounded. Pity." "It happens in war." "Many boys have left this world." "We don't know who's next." "Forgive me that the paper is so grubby." "Burn the letter after you read it." I was lighting the sauna stove and mom was working the field. My parents had been separated for a couple of years. But they had reconciled. At this stage, father had promised to stop drinking. But he didn't keep his promise. Father was a bit drunk- and he came to ask me if mom had had other men - while they were separated. I was so outraged by this that I took a metallic ladle- and tried to hit him. He lost his temper totally. There was a big vat of water boiling next to me- and father tried to push my head into it. He would have succeeded, but mom hear the commotion - and came over: "What is going on?" That snapped dad out of it. I don't think he had realized what he was doing. Next morning there was a white table cloth on the table. Mom and dad sit on one side of the table, - and my little brother sat next to me. After a long oppressive silence mom asked me: - "Kauko, did you hit father?" That was basically it. We dropped the subject. But afterwards- I would have liked to tell her everything that happened. What dad asked me and what he tried to do to me- after I struck him. Once they fought and turned to me to ask- which one of them had worse marks in their face. Once again I got the sinking feeling in my stomach. I just had to leave. I went into the woods, - sat behind a big rock and wanted to run away. This is not the right place for me. I was not yet in school, but I do remember- that he was drunk and got upset about something. He took the axe and started going around our house. We thought he would break the windows- but he hit the wall under the windows. My eldest brother got a long stick- and was able to hit dad in the hands - and he dropped the axe. Sometimes, when dad lost his temper in the field - he would first beat the horse and then my brother. War is an experience which leaves no one untouched. He told us war stories when he was drunk. He also dove under the table to avoid shrapnel. "I'm scared." "So scared." "My calves, thighs and arms are shaking." "My brains can't stop them." "The planes are back for a second run." "I'm so scared that I can't think straight." "My God, how can it be?" "I'm going to punish..." "I'm going to punish this body for this deceit, this shaking." "The laws of war..." "Cowardice is a deathly sin! Laws of war." "There is no other law of war: Cowardice is bad." "And I'm afraid. How can I get my hands to obey?" "I must get up again." "Body, get up!" "Knees! Bend." "Cursed body. How can it be so scared?" 22-year-old laborer, admitted 5th of July... Patient arrived on stretchers. Didn't move at all. Doesn't react with surroundings. Doesn't answer questions. Whispered a few times in a low voice: "Shoot." Had had no sleep for four days. Received a hot meal only once. Was shocked in Vitele- when he emptied a nearly full submachine gun magazine- at a Russian, who kept coming at him, smiling. Finally the enemy fell, but the patient- was afraid that the enemy has become immortal. "One of the POWs is an actor from theTurkmenistan." "There's also aTatar and still another a Mongol." "We should kill this motley crew right away." "I hope they leave us alone for a hundred years - after this brawl." "They were brown and stank to high heaven." "Now I know what they mean - when they say that the Russkies smell." "They're not human, they're lower animals." Suddenly he hears the click of a gun - and sees a Russian soldier pulling the trigger of a light machine gun. But the gun has jammed. Dad tried to raise his gun, but before he was able to do that- the Russian jumped on him. Jumps from behind the tree. Dad is taken by surprise. They began wrestling. Dad told me that the Russian was about the same size as he was. But clearly stronger. They wrestled on the ground. At times one was on top. At times the other one. It was a fight to the death. The Kirghiz was on his belly. Dad was on top, pushing the man down. Dad was sitting on the small of his back. The Kirghiz was out of breath. The fight was decided in the end by the fact- who got hold of the knife. And was able to silence the opponent. When the Kirghiz was out of breath, father hit him - with his own woodcarving knife that he had brought from home. He hit him in the back. Right between the ribs. That ended the fight. The Kirghiz began spitting blood. There was no fight in him anymore. Other Finns started gathering around. Dad sat on the ground. And he told me that he wept like a child. He had just turned 19. He was crying and his platoon leader said: "Cry away, Huhtala. You'll feel better." Next thing that happens- after the comforting words of the platoon leader- is that one of the men takes the gun from the Kirghiz- and shoots him in the head. With his own personal weapon. The jam had cleared. Dad blamed himself for not taking the man as a prisoner. He spent many years at the front. What kind of thanks did he get? He wasted several years. It was summer and mom was preparing dinner. Dad came in upset about something. To this day, I don't know about what. He swept everything off the table. All the plates and cutlery that mom had put on the table. And then he left. And then he left. Dad disappeared. I asked where did he go. No one knew. For some reason, I decided to go look for him. I believe I was already in school. I saw dad sitting on a cliff- looking at the lake. I didn't dare to go and talk to him. But at home, I told where he was, - and the police picked him up. We went nature hiking with dad. He had a walking stick in his hand. I noticed that when we went on these trips- dad soon became distant. He wasn't present any longer. He lifted his black walking stick this way, - and hid behind a fir tree. He took aim with one eye closed. I told him:"Let's go, dad." And he replied: "Let's keep quiet and listen." "You walk on, daddy stays here for a bit." And he took aim again. The moment was tense and quiet. This happened very often. When we came back from that path - dad would slowly re-enter this world. I believe I was on patrol with my father. That's why I consider myself one of the men of JR6. I think my father's war ended on the 26th of November 1972 - in Kouvola cemetery. He was 46-years-old when he died. He died of chirrosis of the liver. In other words, alcoholism. For the last five years, he was constantly drunk. 37-year-old farmer admitted 1st of July... In his baptism of fire, he was shaken by an explosion. Was left unconcious behind enemy lines with a comrade. When they woke up, they began looking for own troops. Vomited blood. The journey to own lines difficult. His comrade was anguished, - and unexpectedly killed himself with a grenade. Patient calms down with light conversation. But when discussing more personal things he cries a lot. "I can hear music." "Grand and majestic music." "Over us." "On all sides. In front of us." "Countless metallic greetings shriek and whistle past us." "They seem to be racing to the east." "The world has turned into the devil's playground." "It's not going to change, no matter how long we fight." "It might be best to kill oneself, before someone else does." "It is sort of incredible how one feels at home - even in this commotion." "You may find yourself listening to the symphony being played." "You have wholly forgotten what this machinery is for." Dad sits in the corner, smoking in chain. There are flies buzzing around. It is afternoon. The sun shines through the window to highlight the rag rug. I don't understand what my dad is saying. Or why he is talking. And keeps on talking. I wanted to run outside - and knew that I have to go through three doors - before I'm outside. Which moment would be most suitable to get out- so that I won't ruin his story. It seems that the moment never arrives. Today, I believe that it was a sort of therapy for him. He had a real need to tell us what happened. I think it is sad that no one was interested in the end. At one time, I read all the books about the war- that I could lay my hands on. In the end I realized - that perhaps I wanted to read about it- because I had lost my father to the war. I lost a carefree quality in my life- which should be part of every childhood. That I could have gone out to the meadow- and picked flowers for my dad. That wasn't my childhood. I lived in the countryside, - so nature has always been comforting to me. One of the best moments was - when I saw wind move a field of corn - I thought it looked like someone was petting it. My father was 17 when he went to war. By today's standards he was a child. Although he had been in the Civil Guard - since he was 12-years-old. If you're expected to be heroic - already in the Civil Guard when you're 12-years-old. You try to live up to the ideals. But when you actually panic or lose your nerve in war - your reaction becomes crushingly shameful. "Everyone wants to go to the front- and think they're going to bask in glory." "But glory is nowhere to be found." Field Marshal Mannerheim in his Declaration 117: "The enemy has launched an all out offensive against us." "Kannas, the Karelian Isthmus - is once again the primary bloody stage- for the attack of our ancient foe." "Finnish soldiers, - you know that the fate of the Fatherland rests on you." "You won't lose heart in the face of adversity." "You have- as have we all - experienced hard blows together." "And we will face and endure them together again." Today, on the 23rd of September 1944- we will have to write a dark chapter- in the over 600-year-old history of Käkisalmi." This is the last view of the town. Soviets are expected to arrive at any minute. The time is 15:54 hours as we leave Käkisalmi - where we wish to return very soon. Urho, Ilmari, Reino and Arvo. Ilmari fell already in the Winter War. The oldest brother Urho became a pilot. His plane's engine died and he went down with it. Reino was a couple of years older than Arvo. He was a sergeant major in the air force. And he was the only one who survived. They were not able to adjust to civilian life after the war. They were not able to adjust to civilian life after the war. They were not able to give up the anger they felt. That may have been a defense mechanism. Their actions may not have been logical - from the point of view of civilian life after the war. But you have to understand them in the context- of where they were born. In other words, in war. People were miserable behind the facade. Dad slept with an axe under the bed. He was sullen and seemed to be angry all the time. He couldn't stand anything perceived as criticism. Especially if he was felt it was directed at his handicap. He smashed furniture and threatened with weapons. When dad said that he'll kill her, mom replied: "Go on, I'm going to Heaven." Mom shrieked and I turned around to find dad - with a piece of firewood ready to strike me. He was about to split my head open. He went to war to win peace, but in a way- brought the war home with him. He mellowed towards the end, partially because of medication. And we were able to become closer. By then, I was also more interested in his experiences - but we were not able to discuss them before he passed away. He must have buried the matter deep inside- because he never told us about the war. Not even when me and my brother were adults. We never talked about the war. When the final moments were at hand - mother asked dad, whether he'd like to see a pastor. He wanted to see one. So, we asked the chaplain to see him. Later mom asked him what they talked about. Dad said, he told the chaplain about the war. And the time he had spent in a hospital. "I was not a man, since I couldn't hack it." He had been carrying shame around all these years. He underwent some kind of a religious awakening. When I came home on holiday- I found him sitting in a rocking chair. He was sitting and rocking back and forth. As I came in, - he apologized to me. I passed the rocking chair and sat by the table- and wondered if he meant it or not. What was the reason behind it? That he apologized to me. That he apologized to me. He simply said it, he didn't mean it. I didn't react in the way I should have. And I was not given a second chance. The grief is still present. And that's fine. But had he come back alive - in the horrible condition he was in - our life would not have been pleasant. He would not have survived. He looks very tired and miserable. In another picture he looks very sad. I felt empathy towards him. His life had too many hardships. To this day, I sometimes dream that I'm living in a time of war - and that I have to survive somehow. I guess it harkens back to my childhood - and the fact that I'm worried about myself. I'm still fighting a war. I've come to understand the reasons behind his behavior. I understand the reasons why he did what he did. That has been a big deal. It's been important for me. But it has led to some kind of forgiveness. It gives me comfort. It has been immensely important and essential - for my health, state of mind, and even survival. I had to understand what was going on. It is a better option than suffering and destruction. Better to find a way out. A person should live in the moment. And make choices of their own free will, if possible.
