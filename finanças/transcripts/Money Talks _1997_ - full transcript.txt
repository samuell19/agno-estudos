No, not you, you asshole. I'm talking to somebody else. What? Man: Tragedy and terror strike the southland. Good afternoon. A bus delivering prisoners from the men's central lockup to the van nuys courthouse was destroyed just moments ago on the first street bridge in downtown los angeles. 14 prisoners and 2 policemen were killed in what authorities are describing as a commando-style raid. All bodies have been accounted for with the exception of 2 prisoners. Witnesses say they saw 2 men boarding a helicopter shortly after the bus exploded into flames. The 2 fugitives are wanted in connection with the murders. Man, this has got sweeps week written all over it. Yeah. Let me know how it turns out. Apprehending these 2 men. Pictured on the left is a john doe police arrested earlier at l.a.x. For possession of a counterfeit passport. And on the right, franklin maurice hatchett, a local street hustler with suspected gang ties who was en route to van nuys to be arraigned on charges of soliciting goods. The 2 fugitives, john doe and hatchett, are considered dangerous. 14 prisoners due to face a van nuys judge today now face the ultimate judgment day of all. One where sentencing comes with no chance of reversal. Freeze! Come out with your hands above your head. I'm gonna come out, but I didn't do it! Don't shoot! I didn't kill no cops! Hello. Is this james russell? I'm on my way. I cannot wait for you to eat my ass. All right, here it is. Yeah? Good afternoon. I'm detective Pickett, and this is williams here. I wondered if we might have a little chat with you about Franklin Hatchett. Well, franklin's not here, ok? We're dealing with a multiple homicide here. Would you just open the door? Excuse you? I'm sorry. Listen, it would only take a few minutes of your time. We'd really appreciate it. Please. Yeah, all right. Come on. Thank you so much. So, uh, when was the last time you spoke to him? Who, franklin? Yeah. Well, he left on the freak train to atlanta 6 weeks ago. You know, I haven't seen him since. What, do you think this is funny? You think this is a joke? I got a busload of bodies and a couple dead cops because of your gangbanger. Look, franklin ain't no banger, ok? If I find out you're helping him, I'm telling you right now, I swear to god I'm going to make your life miserable. Hey, hey, hey, back off, please. Will you treat the lady with some respect? Thank you. Can you help us out, paula? I swear, I don't know where he is, ok? Oh, this is such bullshit! You know... Hey, it's ok, it's ok. All I'm saying is if he tries to contact you, give me a call, all right? It's so much better for franklin if he turns himself in. He stays out on the street, paula, he's gonna get himself killed. Now, I'm trying to protect him, I really am. This is my card. Will you give me a holler? Yeah, ok. Thank you. Keep it running. Ok. This might be quick. All right. White boy. What the fuck was that for? That's for getting me busted, goddamn it. What you bring a gun down here for? 'cause you're wanted for murder, asshole. I ain't murdered no-goddamn-body. I don't know that. Well, now you know, 'cause if I could, I'd murder your ass right now, coming down here with a gun and shit. You know, guns don't kill people. Stupid motherfuckers with guns kill people. Oh, I'm enlightened. Yeah. Let me enlighten your ass. Bring your monkey ass on up here. Got me running all over goddamn town. People shooting at me and shit. You the one got me in this shit. Ought to kick your ass in the head. Freezing. I know. I was in the motherfucker earlier. Listen to me. I want an exclusive. A what?

Franklin, I will protect you. I'll get you turned in safe and sound, let you tell your side of the story, but I want the exclusive. I'll hide you for the weekend. It'll all be over on monday. First of all, I don't trust your ass, and how the hell I know this exclusive shit gonna clear my name? I guess you don't. But without me, you're probably gonna end up dead. They need someone to blame, and guess what. Right now it's you. What do you say? I ain't staying in this neighborhood, man. I can't stay here for no 2 days. I'm sorry. That's right. You can't stay here for no 2 days. What you talkin' about? You're coming to my wedding. Your wedding? Shit, hell, no. I ain't going nowhere. Po-po looking for me, man. Trying to kill me? Uh-uh.

Come on, dawg, we got time. I need you to take a shower, shave the beard, lose the earring, and please do something about that hair of yours. What you talkin' about? My 'do is tight. Every cop in the city is looking for that tight 'do. Whatever, man. Look, I'll hook up the hair, but I ain't touching the earring, 'cause I'm still a player! That's fine. I'm gonna make a phone call. I don't think there's any hot water left. What? You heard me. What?! Punk-ass white boy. This tub better be clean. Yeah. Who is it? Hey, barclay, it's james. How you doing? Listen to me.

He's at my place right now safe and sound for the moment. Congratulations, you're rehired. I thought I was supposed to clear out my stuff by monday. Didn't you say that? You said that, right? No, but, jimmy, darling, you didn't really take me seriously, did you? You're pulitzer material. I've always said that. I'll send a camera crew down to... What is it...
