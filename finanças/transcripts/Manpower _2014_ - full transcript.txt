But still can't kick with his left. Your meat. Thank you. -You don't have to thank me. Why don't you think it over? leaving in the middle of the school year. Think about the boy. Taking him from his friends. He'll be alone there. There are plenty of Jews there -Not enough Jews here? We don't like it here. You know that. -Yes. See you later. -Say goodbye to Grandpa! Bye, Grandpa. -See you tonight. -See you. "Blessed are You, Lord, King of the universe, "Who commanded us to kindle the Sabbath candles." Smells good. Dad. My house isn't a storeroom.

They don't want to draft me. They say I'm Filipino. I say you're hot. I have to go run. How do we get to the Bahai Kubbo Club? Central Bus Station, Entrance 3, be the shue shop. Manila Avenue, right? Then turn right. -Okay, thanks. Bye. Want to come with us? No, I have to go. Okay. Bye. So, under 8 minutes? Yeah Good for you. You stink So what'? -That's what. So what? That's what Didn't I ask you to clean the back room? The empty room? -I left you a note, right? I think it's more important to clean Yoav's room so it's clean for him, when he returns from the army. Nobody sleeps in the back room. If I wanted my cleaner to run my life I'd live with my mother. I'm going, so clean the back room, okay? Ms. Michal, I have to leave soon too. Where are you going?

But what if home is here? The decision has been made. We're the Immigration Police. Our job is to handle all this immigration. You mean deportation. It's more like returning. -Here Take these forms and get families to sign. Tell them to leave at will. Whose will? -Cut it out, Bamba. This is the Jewish state. V\Je give you a chance and you argue with yourself. Them, the Russians, started out as cleaners, too. Now they're writers, engineers, doctors. You clean for a few years and move ahead. Enough talk, Meir. I want exact names, like in the passport. No "Brother" this or "Pastor" that, or any of that crap. Marital status, children's ages, birth certificates, everything. Why me? -They listen to you. What do I get in return? You decide. We can pick up your wife and kid and drive to the airport right now or you can bring me the names and I'll let you leave at will. We'll tell the boy we're renovating. Yeah, right. -Why not? We deserve to renovate. Take care. ake lots of money. Good luck in Canada. Don't make me wait! -Just a minute. Why's he making me wait?

Leave me alone. -I can't. You're so sexy. -Cut it out! Then tell me! Because I'm a Filipino? Your mother's a Filipina! Erez People say we're like a villa in the jungle and it's very true. We have no future without our army. The Arabs will kill us. That's why I want to go. To a combat unit. I don't want a desk-job. Sorry. Desk-jobs are important too. You keep saying ”us" and "ours"... but you're a Filipino. Like you are a Moroccan. Excuse me? -My mother's a Filipina. How do you define yourself? I don't know. Give it a try. I don't know what you mean. We're checking if you're truly part of our society. that the center of your life is here. I work at "Aroma", I go to high school, like Israeli music... all kinds.

I see your pain, but don't push me around. Okay? Shall we move on? As a police officer you can get a loan to pay your mortgage. That's what everyone does. All right. I'll take it.

And after that I have a union meeting. If you can go out to work, you can take him to the clinic. That's not a fair comparison. A fair comparison is to say I'd rather clean another boy's room than my son's room. No Jewish woman will go back to cleaning her own house. She doesn't care who cleans it. e are migrant workers, not refugees. Committed workers, professionals We are temporary workers. -Can you define time? Can you? I don't have to. I have my watch. I do, too. Then what time is it? I think you're late. Don't worry, honey. It'll blow over soon Okay? -Okay. Sorry about last time, my son forgot... and the teacher didn't remind me. I had a parent-teacher meeting. Okay, but next time let me know and I'll get someone else. Did you see I got the wipes you asked for? The perfumed ones? Didn't you see? I'm talking to you. How can you get someone else? -Pardon me? Who'd clean Yoav's room'? Now he's back from the army. But I asked you not to clean his room! You were wrong! I was right! Now he's sleeping in a clean room. You were wrong, I was right! I don't know what to say. -Don't say anything. Shut up for a change. You smoke here? The Jews took me in the middle of Neve Shanan st. They say there's a place they want me to see with my own eyes. We started driving to the Negev. We passed Netivot, Sderot. Ofakim, you know that road? -Yes. of course. In the middle of nowhere I saw these people building a prison. You know what, my brother? The thing that worries me the most is that they build a seperate side for women and children. With a big yard. The police say: That place is for you, you must go at will or... troubles. They tell me the same thing. What did you do? Nothing. It's all Jewish politics, the Ministry of the Interior. A week or two it'll pass. We'll bend our head and it'll go way. How do you know this prison is meant for us? What do you mean? It could be a regular prison, or for refugees from Sudan. Who cross from Egypt. Or for Arabs. -Exactly. -I hope so. I hope so. -Yeah. You shouldn't have. What is it? You're kidding. That's great Come here. Good luck in the army. - Thanks. -Cheers. To Erez. Let's take a picture. Hey. -Hi. -Hi. Rozi! Let's get out of here. Allright I've had enough Then let's go watch a movie. -A matinee? What are we, pensioners? What do you want to do? Very good. Give it to him. Again. Now you'll taste some good cooking -Veah right. Your house isn't a storeroom. Exactly what I told him. Why don't you get a computer, hookup the internet. talk to your grandson on Skype. There's no room There's plenty of room. What did you write? I'm not writing. I saw you writing. Date and heading: "Employee's letter of explanation." What are you supposed to explain'? Assholes I called Shiomi and Galit. They won't hire me Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all How do you know Yoel? From the Police Academy. He works with you a lot. -Yeah, many cops like us and we like many cops. No mall security here. No lost Ethiopians or drunk Russians. Our jobs are classier. Luxury buildings, villas, VIPs stuff like that Fine. -Great. Next step is an I.Q. test. I place you according to the results. You pay for the test, okay? What do I need a test for? Over 10 years with the police, decorated officer. Sorry, our clients require it and we must provide it, ok? got it? Great You have a firearms license, right? What do you think? You probably do. You do? You do I must ask. -Great. -Great. Driver, stop here please. Who is that? -Sweetie it's me. He can't sleep? I have time before football tomorrow. I'll take him to the doctor. But the clinic is open today. Now. I don't like you going out in daylight. What have we got, if we can't go out in daylight? We don't have nothing. I'm taking him tomorrow. Dad, can I have another donut? No. One's enough. But Mom lets me. -She doesn't. I'll buy you a Ho-Ho after the Promise? -Promise. You should've come earlier, you don't mess with ears. You're right, Doctor. -It's very dangerous. Yes, that's exactly what I told my wife. I just had a case that ended... in a miracle, if you understand me. You live near the Central Station? There's a doctor every day. I volunteer on Tuesdays. t's for refugees -Yes, an open clinic. We aren't refugees! You see? We have health plan cards. We aren't refugees. I understand. Doctor, don't think you do. Daddy, when's the game? -No game today, buddy. We're going on a trip. -Where to? -It's a surprise. 10 Mt. Hermon? Bamba. Come here. Please get in the van. Give me a hand here, Rosa. Fuckers.
