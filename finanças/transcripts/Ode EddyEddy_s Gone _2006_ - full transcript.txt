A few months earlier one friend who actually met him only once, he said that he met him once and concluded, his comics aside, just from his behaviour, that Eddy was a genius. You take that for granted. That's Eddy, he's a genius, okay, now shut up Eddy, you know... We know you're a genius, shut up and work. How stupidly I've drawn this. There goes a hedgehog, after him goes a mouse, after him 10 ants, and nothing else by any chance. EDDY'S GONE 1. Genius Tell us, what are you drawing, Eddy? - What are you drawing? - Leave me be, you're stoned. So what? Go away! Why? He said... So what... And you are...? Cry, cry... I'm drawing a teddy bear. He doesn't know how to draw. Everything had to be his way. If we had agreed to meet here at some specific time, when we had all have to come, everyone would already work at that time, he would come last, of course, he would be extremely nervous, because it was raining, taxi driver was stupid, I don't know, Zagreb is a shitty town, it's too crowded or there's no one in the streets, or whatever. He would come nervous, already broke deadlines, And then he would start: "Move, that's my chair." Everything had to be his way. We had lunchtime when he was hungry. - Give me half of the bread. - You want to share a girl also? - No, no... - Move those cakes. - Jesus, feed us. - Those are old cakes. - I know they are but they look nice. He was grumbling, but when someone would bring to him some drawings to show he would become very serious and objective about it. And very positive because he wanted to encourage you to further work. His grandma died. He's a nice person but he's also very evil in fact. - Yeah? - Yes. How do you mean - evil? - Well, he's corrupted, he likes to shit-talk. Things like that. Okay, joking is something else but he had a really good approach to that. That was great. He was a man you could talk about wallpapers and it would be interesting. He had opinion on everything and it was funny. We were talking about films that we liked. And, when we would talk about some cadre he would say it was this and that cadre and we would all know what he was talking about. Pretty simple. There weren't unknowns. He simply had... a camera in his head. And you could see that in his comics. He was very deep into films. He had a character definitely. Even when he was angry, when we had fights, there were always some misunderstandings. But it was pleasure talking to him. It was impossible not to love him. 2. Lucas Here we are tonight, in the very honorable company of a man to whom we all owe... Mister George Lucas. Mister Lucas, what do you think about your latest work? I like it. Could you explain that a bit? It's complex, it borrows forms from all myths and... transforms them into hamburger. He always yelled he'll drive a rocket. That he'll be a pilot. He liked that. And I was thinking... Drawing, he will draw as a hobby. He wanted applied arts or... one more crazy idea, he'll go to Belgrade, on military academy. And he'll be a pilot. Which I, normally, didn't simply... I said: I have only you, no chance that you'll go to Belgrade. It's not my fault everyone took it so seriously. He had good relationships with classmates. Of course, there were always... But yeah, people liked him because he was a prankster. And I also think... that he was extra popular because of the way he was drawing. Even at school where everyone was drawing this was very attractive. We were from the very beginning very much into comics, for us it was the most important thing in the world. We only wanted to be comic artists when we grow up. I am... this. This. Is me. A brush. Okay, brush, I didn't... - A good brush. - And this... this is everyone else. Just a second. Primitive, plastic... And in fact... they could afford themselves something better but they do not dare so they have to be satisfied with trash. He was stubborn. I was curious and asked him when will know the results. He said after 12. Summer, the weather was nice. I went there earlier, sat on the bench, and waited for the results. This guy brought the list, put it on the notice board. Jesus. I saw it. Six candidates, then red line, my son the seventh. This was very hard for me. Then he came with his classmates which also competed there, and when they saw the list they started laughing. I asked them why they were laughing. They said that on the list were names that didn't even finish high school. Those are nothing but noobs and crybabies, they will never give me an Oscar. I met in Jabuka two girls. (club in Zagreb) They told me their friend worked as a night guard in Zagreb Film and let them in one evening. He showed them the place and they saw for example movie theater, this and that, but all of this was nothing. What stupefied them the most was a room of some pervert who covered the walls from top to bottom with Playboy posters. And I said to them: that's our room. You know how it is. A man is a weak creature... And wants to be persuaded to do something entertaining. So it went like this: - Hey Eddy, let's play pinball. - I can't, I have to work. Then you don't repeat the question but you hear something like Then you know what to say: Eddy, let's play pinball. Okkaayyy. Our meetings in Zagreb Film got us used to drawing together. We enjoyed it very much because it was a mixture. We were drawing and doing our job but also did that which others were doing playing cards or going to football games. That group drawing was usually changing places. When we were kicked out from Zagreb Film we spent most of the time at Talaja's place. - Dzuka, is this... - People are eating from that. - What? - What happened, Eddy? - A little less disgust, please. - Do you want me to cook or not? - I want. Then give me some lifespace and workspace. - Stop bullshiting that I'm disturbing you. - Oh, for fuck's sake... - Yes you are, look at your stupid ass. - Go away. When lunch is cooked, we leave the big table and go to the small one. And then we have a short break from drawing while we eat. We usually watch some trailers, or cartoon or something. We really enjoyed that and then miracle happened. Once, Tico brought a video cassete but didn't want to tell anything he was just winking to me, so I wouldn't say that we'll watch it. So we sat down to eat, and Tico put the videotape. We all reacted, Eddy, of course, reacted last. Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop! -Stop, stop... - Stop, stop! - Stop. - Stop! - And again. -Stop! Namely, what... Phantom Menace Long awaited prequel of Stars Wars finally came on videotape, as a trailer. We watched it like 5, 6 times in a row, screamed out of happiness. When we saw it finally it was the fulfillment of our aspirations, hopings, whishes. Doctor George Lucas finally came back. And now he will show to all amateurs how to film science fiction. I don't know if he fought for for drawing the Star Wars or if they were given to him but in any case it was his dream job. Wait, wait... Fuck it. I've had it.... Yes, I can feel your thoughts, your feelings for your sister. Mister Lucas, how do you comment all this? They are good. I didn't imagine it like that but the Academy will be satisfied. They are very avant-garde and with good CGI we'll have a hit. 3. Grendel Eddy didn't like when they called him an artist. If someone would say that... I screw you, and I screw him, and I screw 5000 years of culture. He was always saying he was a craftsman with a soul. Talaja is a bad motherfucker. The most Croatian comic, probably ever made, is Grendel, by Eddy and Macan. Because it tells about Croats and Croatia and it's written in English. It is a fictional story, futuristic, postapocalyptic, but it's our, domestic story, set in our domestic terrain, and above all it's published in USA, it's recognized everywhere, everyone mentions it as a cult comic in their collections. They did, in this Croatian context, the most you can do it. And it's not... just a story and illustration understandable only to them, but it's univerio.... universio... universal... Eddy found out here he got job on Grendel. He didn't have phone so I chased him through the city and found out he's here, at his friend's boutiqe. I came here and he was climbing the stairs. I asked: what are you doing from 15th January to 15th May next year and he: I'm drawing Grendel? - And I said yes. That's how he found out. - There. Then we started to work but that "start" lasted for months. Eddy was doing sketches, slowing down and I, in one moment, went nuts we had a quarrel, I took a job from him. Faggot! But he always knew how to charm somebody. So he even persuaded awful me to go back to business. The post office didn't let us use scotch tape for package. So the envelope got ruined during the trip to USA, and that attracted attention from the editor She asked aren't we having a war and I said no, it's 100 kilometers further to calm her and she's travelling that distance to her job. And... Nothing, that's how we got the job. His layouts sold us immediately. I'm the man. Eddy worked for 4 months these 2 issues of Grendel most diligently. Once he was super happy because he did 5 pages in one night. I don't know any other way. He never repeated it but okay. In spite of all the evil tongues that said he won't do it. This was that American dream. You go there, make comics, get paid, everyone loves you, admire you. I culminated when he got Russ Manning award for best upcoming cartoonist which is an award that has specific significance because it's given by other cartoonists. Reaction here was... one seizmic wave among authors, who started thinking outside the Croatian box, it can be done, it's not immposible, from normal fans who compliment you to drunk person on some party which tells you: "you showed them!" I don't know to whom did we show something but these were in any case happy times. 4. Little gang This was the standard procedure, knocking on doors. I would then stand here, light a cigarette and wait half an hour whatever he was doing in the meantime. He didn't let us upstairs. And we had to knock so he would know it's us, friends. If we had rung he would have thought he had to pay some bills or such. And then you go nuts. After a year you realize damn, he was never on time. Never. And then we decided to make a joke, Tico, Bob and I. We always waited for Eddy in the car, in the night, half an hour, so we now decided he should be waiting for us. Baba was driver, he parked the car further from Eddy's entrance. So he couldn't see us at first. When he came out we came to him by foot, like: Hi, what's up, we came by foot, Baba's car broke down. It's already 10 PM, we have to catch a tram. Of course, Eddy was furious. And then we set off for the bus station as if. I don't remember it well... But we told him in one moment we were joking. We were joking with him a few minutes, but we were sorry for the man... We won't fool him anymore, ha ha, Baba is just around the corner. Let's go to Baba's car, and he screamed at us, you fools, monkeys... As I was waiting like that in the entrance behind me the light turned on, or not, I don't remember anymore, but some guy came running. And he knocked on my car window. I turned around and saw a guy, he was holding something here. A Sicilian mob guy, totally. A gun on his belt. He said: put down the folders. We all had our own paranoid ideas, what is happening here, someone even Bob or Eddy, saw blood on Baba. Psychedelia... They were cops, both. I was relieved. We asked what was that about, they didn't want to tell us. One guy wanted to search our folders. And that was really bad situation because I had stashed a smaller piece of pot and Eddy had a nice chunk. Luckily, he searched Tico who hadn't anything so we didn't get caught. There was a connection between work and smoking. It's easier to sit and work. It's the fundamental reason... I don't watch football, I don't loiter around, Should I draw him bald? It's good while you're drawing. I don't think it's connected with inspiration or talent. It's different with the work for Americans, on a monthly issue. You have to sit down and work every day. Eddy couldn't do that, he couldn't do a page at a day. How should I not smoke then? It was the third time he was to be taken off job. So he was affraid that maybe he actually wasn't meant to be a cartoonist because if it happens all the time, if he can't finish one project to the end, then why is he doing that? He liked to draw, but more than that he liked to freestyle, He liked to have a feedback. And also, he felt abandoned from me and others while working on Star Wars. Luckily he managed to finish it. We even agreed to support him without his knowing, to talk to him like: you can do it, you're the man. Of course he realized it and got mad like: don't shit to me, what am I a woman? Am I incapable? You're asshole, your comics are shit, you're shit, you're ready for trashcan. You're good for nothing. But he appreciated our engagement, our support and atmosphere we made around him. Look, look, Mike Mignola. I think they sincerely admired him. And Eddy refused to grow up so he tried to find friends on his level, who were child-spirited. Who adored Star Wars and stuff like that, like him. Life wanted him to grow up and he didn't want to surrender. 5. Whooooaaaaa, what a game Eddy liked everything to be a game. I remember some stupid joke he told about Titanic that sinked while they were playing hide and seek and little monkey sqinted his eyes. And monkey opened eyes while on some floating piece of wood in the ocean, Opened his eyes, ocean around him and he says: whoa, what a game! That face of his while telling this joke was a typical Eddy's face for me. Just laugh and fun. As you have less fun with getting older I think this was... Of course, he was killed by cancer but this ended him. We miss Eddy as a friend. - Can I say? - Say it. - Eddy pulled with him this little group of ours. - Yeah. Exactly. Group of authors, cartoonists that wanted to succeed outside Croatia. He pulled it, no doubt. End when he left, this link stopped working. Yeah, this relationship was based around comics since we all drew them. But it wasn't only about comics. There was lots of friendship and having fun, what Esad said. When Eddy was in good mood, he was in the best mood of us all. And he couldn't withstand someone not having fun. - When he wanted to have fun, everyone had to have fun. - Or he'd get angry. It affected me hard. I... He was too joyful person to die... He had lots to say yet to die so soon... I was convinced he'll get well. That he'll get out of the hospital healthy. I was convinced. It seemed possible. And then the worst happened. And no one could take it easily. There was a long period of emptiness. When it happend you could feel vacuum in our group. Which still exists... I don't want to say Eddy was head of this group... But maybe he was... ...I think it's not... ...this is totally... ...if he's sober, if he's sober... ...I don't know its name... ...stupid... ...in English... I remember this photo, do you? What, they've started to work? I'm not finished. Here. You can put him on the toilet wall and then shit on him. This is one of the better... No it's not. This is very authentic. You were doing the best mischiefs. Of course, I'm not finished yet but soon... I did nothing, I'm just shiting around. Every asshole flies to his nest. Whoooaa, what a game. I give you this and you say: but Talaja you love me. C'mon Talaja, why are you such a faggot? Finished.
