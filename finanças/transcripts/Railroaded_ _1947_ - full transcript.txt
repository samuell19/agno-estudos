Clara. I positively feel like a new woman. How do you like it? - Like it? Honey, I just hope you get home safely. Okay. Time to get your money up on the eighth at Tanforan. Call it, Marie. We're closing up. Clara. I just picked me a sure shot. Vera, you can lose your dough just as easy tomorrow. I thought the customer was always right, Clara. Since when? Ain't I got a right to a date once in a while? After all, I run this deal as a convenience to people like you. And believe me, it's a headache. Alright, Clara. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thanks. Did you count the take for the week yet? - Yeah. Almost five thousand. Good. Marie. See they close the front door tight. Yes. Sure. No noise. You understand? No noise. Get back in there. [ Scream! ] Drop it. Kowalski. Listen. This is the Doc's house. I'm going to leave you here, see. He has to turn you in. But don't worry. I'll pull strings and get you off. Cowie. Listen. You don't say anything, see. Just this. The guy who was with you on the job. Is the same guy that owns the truck. Steve Ryan. Steve Ryan. You understand? You just stick to that. If you don't. I'll get to you. Yes, Duke. I understand. I'll do that. [ Car horn ] And that's all, eh? Just the way it happened? Yeah. Now, what about the laundry truck? What color was it? Gray. And the two guys. One was dark. The other had 'sandy hair' you said. No. - Right. They both had dark hair. - How do you know? I know. I was there. - Out like a fish most of the time. Which one had sandy hair? The one who shot the cop. And you say? They both had black hair. Both dark. It seems you were a little upset. You're sure one of them had sandy hair? What do you think I do for a living, Captain? Every day of my life the first thing I do is look at a person's hair. The one who shot the cop had sandy hair. Mickey, will you .. Okay, mind-reader. And you didn't know either one of them? Nobody you'd ever seen before? Golly, no. I got some more dope on that O'Hara thing. The truck was gray. One of the men had sandy hair. Broadcast to all cars. "Car 15." "Car 15." "At the doctor's home." "771 Ellenwood." "A gunshot suspect." Do you remember anything else? No. If that's all then, Captain. - Not quite. Everybody in town seems to think that betting on horses is good clean fun. Except us. We got a different viewpoint. Because we've read a city ordinance that says no to that sort of entertainment. Jim. Take these ladies down to Bunco. Sergeant Keating. I suppose you think iron bars can hold me? They've worked out pretty good so far. "All cars. Additional." "On the beauty shop robbery." "The truck was gray." "One of the suspects has sandy hair. That is all." Alright, Mickey. It's your baby now. I've got some extradition stuff to work out. You know, there may be something in this. A regulation navy scarf. Initials and all. You can pick them up in any surplus store. There were three million guys in the navy including me. It still was a pretty good navy. The shotgun. You can do a lot of damage with a thing like this. That's an FBI matter, isn't it? O'Hara. We were rookies in the old 9th Precinct. Yep. He broke me in. Down on the waterfront. He had a heart as big as a .. House. Could be FBI. But O'Hara was one of us. You're not kidding. Take this stuff down to the lab. Get a receipt for it. Chuck, you'd better work with him. And check that gunshot call. There may be something in it. Ferguson. I don't have to tell you to plug hard on this. No, Mac. You don't have to tell me that. It's too bad. Yes, sir. It's too bad. You had a nice trade worked up. A good spot. A thing like a holdup ruins it. I hate to lose it. Yes. I hate to lose it. 'Women should be struck regularly like gongs'. That is from Oscar Wilde, Wilma. Give it back to him. Okay Calhoun, here it is. You're out on bail. I'll fix the gambling rap. That's a cinch. But you're going to be a witness at a murder trial. I don't want any publicity. If they cross-examine you about your place. It's your own. You're an independent operator. You never heard of Jackland Ainsworth. I can't afford to have my other spots jeopardised. And the club here. I worked hard to get this set up. Okay, Jackland. What happens to me? Take a rest, baby. You are sort-of warm right now anyway. I'll be looking for a new slot for you. What is your side of this? Like every night. I'm coming along to collect the take. See a lot of cops around in prowl cars. I figure it's just after the holdup. So I keep on going. Good. You did right. Duke. You taking me home? Sure. See you later, boss. Jackland ain't so smart. - And he never takes any raps. Give him time. He's crowding his luck. To get us out of this jam you must lay off the bottle. You gotta use your head. I got sense enough to know that. You'd better have. The police calls were okay. It came in that one was sandy-haired. Remind me to give you an ounce of that for your birthday. Marie, the dope, said they were both black-haired. Don't worry. I beat her down. The cops believed me. Marie, huh? Your second mistake for tonight. The screaming. Then that cop pokes his big nose in. It should have been an easy heist. Ainsworth didn't know a thing. Could have knocked off more of his joints. Duke, I didn't think it would be like this. I didn't think anyone would get killed. - I didn't plan it this way either. That Kowalski kid. I should have plugged him. He got soft. Figured he'd go any minute. Somebody found him and called a Doc. He'd better stick to his story about the friend of his he's trying to frame. Duke, honey. I'm holding on to your share for a while too. Don't you trust me? I like you if that's what you mean. Uhuh. That's the house. That's where Steve Ryan lives. And then right at the end of the picture the cops got him. Gee, I felt sorry for him. - A good picture, huh? Yeah. I cried and everything. But they had no right to do that. Just because they had the law on their side. Well, maybe some guys need a going-over. [ Door knocks ] Good evening. I thought the Ryans still lived here. They still do. You are not Rosie, are you? I never thought you would turn out to be so .. Well. Do you remember me? - The moment I opened the door. I thought you were a cop. I am. A full detective now. Who is it? Mickey Ferguson. He used to live up in the next block. Homicide squad. - Very pretty but I'm not interested. It's just procedure. Procedure? - Is Steve here? Steve. If you don't mind, I'll just step inside. Come in. Join the family. Thanks. I will. Hello Steve. - Hello, Mickey. Hello, Mrs Ryan. - Mickey. It's been a long time. - Yep. A long time. I'm here on a little business, Steve. Raise your arms. Is this the guy? - Yep. What's this all about? What did you do tonight, Steve? Worked in my shop in the garage. From when to when? After I got through work. About seven until after nine. When did you leave work? I was late. Had trouble with the truck. Then I parked behind the laundry a little after six. Just like always. I walked home. Worked in my shop. That's all. What's the deal? Were you here tonight? When he was in the shop? We were at the show. Did you ever see this before? Yeah. It's my navy scarf. I stencilled that myself. Here's where the paint run onto the stencil. Where did you get it? I always kept it in the truck. A good actor, ain't he. Hey, what's the score? You'd better get your coat on, Steve. We have a little running around to do. I'd like to know what this is all about. It's about a policeman who was killed tonight in a holdup. Wait a minute. The guy who shot him used this scarf as a mask. Come on, let's go. We have a lot work to do. Let's go, bud. - Take it easy. Take your hands off him. Sorry, sister. I'm the impulsive type. Steve didn't do it. I know he didn't. He couldn't have done it. If he didn't, we'll find it out, Rosie. And if he did we'll find that out too. He was here in his shop. He told you so. You didn't see him. Neither did your mother. Who did? I don't know but I'll find out. Okay. You had nothing to do with it, Steve. I know you didn't. - Sure, mom. Something is all fouled up. Don't you worry. I'll be back soon. I wouldn't wait up for him if I were you. I am sorry, Rosie. Mrs Ryan. Goodnight. Rosa. It's going to be alright, mom. Hi, Sarge. - Hello, Burnsy. How you doing? Lots of latents. But they're all blurred. Is this the other one? Is this your truck? It's the one I drive, yeah. Is it okay to open the door? - Yeah, go ahead. I'm through with it. Your buddy sure bled a lot. My buddy? - Yeah, innocence. I thought you guys had a code and stuck by each other when you got in trouble. But you let your pal bleed to death while you make a getaway. I don't know what you're talking about. Where did you get my truck? - Where you left it. In front of the doctor's house. But I left it in the alley behind the laundry. Sure. We know. Where's the gun, Steve? What gun? The gun you shot O'Hara with. What did you do with it? I had nothing to do with this. He is right. Why don't you just give us your word and we'll let you go home? How soon can I get those prints, Burnsy? Going to work on it all night, Sarge. Anything for a homicide. I thought that's the way you felt about it. Come on. Those monkeys are all alike. The minute they're caught they go yellow. The more I see of them the more I like my dog. At least he's got integrity. Feel that? No. I guess not. Not conclusive, you know. Not too reliable this powder test. If you pick up a suspect right away after he's fired a gun. Before he can wash his hands sometimes you get traces of powder and soot. But then it is only confirmatory. - I see. Just something to hang a few questions on, huh? Yeah. I believe so, more or less. Hold your hand loosely. Relax. Take a look. I don't see a thing. That is right. Nothing to see. I told you it wasn't too reliable. He could have washed his hands. He would have anyway. He probably got blood on his hand when he pushed his pal out. You're crazy. I didn't have anything to do with this. The same old story. Nobody is ever guilty. Have the suspect wait outside, Ferguson. I have a couple of things to show you. Take him out, will you Chubb. The bullet that killed O'Hara. A common type. 0.38 special. Fired from a Dickson revolver. Probably a very short-barrelled gun. A belly gun. Fairly new. In good shape. It's a common type of cartridge. Every cop in town and a lot of other people use them. That isn't all. Sniff that. Well? Perfume. Right. Absolutely. Fastidious, huh? Maybe a woman carries a gun for him until he is ready to use it. It could be. Anyway. Don't lose it, doc. It may be just the thing we need. There's a lot of very nice people running around loose, eh doc? Yes, Mickey. You know. There are only two kinds of animals that make war on their own kind. Rats and men. And men are supposed to be able to think. I think you have something there, doc. How bad is he, doc? I doubt he's going to make it. His lower jaw is shattered. The bullet was deflected upward and lodged at the base of his brain. You could not get it out, huh? - I didn't dare try. Okay to get an identification from him? What is his last temperature, nurse? - Up six-tenths, doctor. Make it awful short. - Okay. You know him? What's his name? - Kowalski. Cowie Kowalski. What happened to him? Watch this closely, Chubb. Was this your sidekick, Kowalski? Now wait. Be sure before you answer. Is this your partner? Listen, Kowalski. Kowalski. If you mean yes just move your right hand. Is this your buddy? Ryan here carried the 0.38. He shot O'Hara. You're a dirty liar. What you trying to do, frame me? Shut up. This is a hospital. Tell them I beat you up for bothering Rosie so now you get even. Go on, tell 'em. Tell them, Cowie. Tell them you lied. Tell them I wasn't the one. Cowie. Cowie. Mrs Wills. - I'm out here, dear. Mrs Wills. Did you see Steve working in his garage last night? No I didn't. We had the Masons in to play bridge and I didn't get a chance. I went to all the neighbors and nobody saw him. Maybe he wasn't in there last night? - He was if he said he was. Of course, dear. Of course. And it must be terrible for you. Just awful but I am baking cookies .. - Thank you, Mrs Wills. Well I never. Well. I think it's enough to have cops outside digging up my flowers .. And poking through Steve's shop without you messing everything up in here. I explained to your mother. This is authorisation. What are you looking for? A gun. And about five thousand in cash. You are mistaken. Because Steve had nothing to do with it. You see, we're not quite as sure about it as you are. Quite the otherwise. Which is Steve's room? Here's Steve's gun if that's what you want. Just .. the other way if you please. Never point a gun at anyone unless you mean to shoot him. Well? - I see what you mean. Ah. Nambu. Japanese. A souvenir? - Uhuh. Not what I am looking for. I want a Dickson belly gun. A 0.38. Oh? That's a shame. I'll go out and buy you one. Look, Rosie. I'm just doing my job. The job the city pays me to do. I'm not paid to persecute people. Also, I'm not paid to let killers get away. Facts. That's all I am interested in. It just happens the facts have led me here to your home. Do you honestly think Steve would .. - I don't know, Rosie. I just don't know but believe me .. I'll work just as hard to free him if I turn up anything in his favor .. As I will to send him up if he's guilty. You know Steve. Do you really think .. Feelings don't count in my racket. Just evidence. Right now the evidence is all against Steve. That's him. That's him alright. He's the one who had the 0.38 and shot the cop. You're crazy. I never saw you before in my life. The other guy pulled the cloth off this fellow's face. I got a good look at him. I'd know him anywhere. He is the one. How did you know it was a 0.38? Well, I .. That's what it said in the papers. What do you say? I'm not sure. I didn't see him without the cloth on his face. I thought he had black hair like the other guy. I'm just not sure. - You're never sure about anything. Thanks a lot. Don't leave town. You'll be needed at the trial. I wouldn't think of it, Captain. Aren't you forgetting I'm out on bail? Okay. Thanks. What did you do with the gun, Ryan? - I don't know anything about any gun. 5,000 bucks is a lot of dough. How did you get rid of it? I spent a thousand on beer. Bought bubble-gum with the rest. Take it easy, Steve. - We're not playing games, kid. Yeah. Not much. You think it's a joke to kill a man? No. Not even a cop. You don't like cops, eh? Oh sure. I'm getting real attached to you guys. How long had you known Kowalski? That guy is lying in his teeth. Was lying. He died? - Yep. Now you'll never know. Now he can never tell you who it was. He told us who it was. - It's a lie. He was lying. Why? Why should he lie? He was badly hurt. You ran out on him. No wonder he squealed. - But I didn't. Go on about Kowalski. I knew Cowie since we were kids. He was always no good. Hanging around. Always hanging around. Then he gets the idea that Rosie is his girl. He keeps bothering her and pestering her. I told him to go away. When was it you saw him last? That is, before you pulled the stickup. I didn't pull any stickup. The night before last. He came around. Asking for Rosie. She told him to stay away. I told him again. He got tough so I laid a couple on him. Fine. I've been waiting for this. We get thousands of suspects in here and every one was framed. According to them. Well, what else? Cowie hated my guts. Holds out well, don't he. Tell us again what you did last night, kid. I got through work shortly after six. I parked the truck in the alley at the back of the laundry. Walked home and went in the house. Mom and Sis were out at a show. I went out and worked in my shop until after nine. Anybody come round while you were in the shop? Any of the neighbors? Yeah. We know. We checked with the neighbors. None of them could say they saw you. Alright. Now I will tell you what happened. You swiped your own truck from behind the laundry. You picked up Kowalski. You pulled the stickup. You didn't figure on a cop butting in. You shot O'Hara. You made your getaway. Your partner was hurt so you left him in the truck outside the doctor's office. You ditched the money and the gun and then you went home. And that was your little program last night. How did you guess it? Don't you think I was awful sharp? I used my own truck and my navy scarf with my initials on it. Then I'm sitting at home eating beans when you guys come in to pick me up. Just how dumb do you think I am? Awful dumb. Or awful smart. So smart you tried to make it so obvious it was you that we'd eliminate you .. Because we could not believe anybody could be so stupid. Look. I want a confession. But I don't want a confession that's thrown out of court .. And fouls up this case and lets this monkey off with a couple of years. Only the gas chamber will satisfy me. And O'Hara. Now. Let's start at the beginning and go all over this. What about the money and the truck? The gun? Duke. Just when you ought to keep your head you start pickling it. Duke, I can't help it. I keep thinking about that cop. Don't think about cops. They ain't people. That kid. That Kowalski. He kicked off and the cops are sold on Ryan. They made a pretzel out of him. We're good if you keep your head and stick to your identification. Look at you. Chasing kites all over the place. [ Door knocks ] Go out there and get rid of them. Hello. Are you Miss Calhoun? I don't believe I've had the honor. I am Steve Ryan's sister. I believe you identified him at the police station. Oh yeah. I guess I did see your picture in the paper. I came here to talk to you and to your friend Miss Weston. She is not here. Well, where can I find her? She's got a new job. A good operator, Marie. The Carlton Hotel. She said both bandits had black hair. She was sure of it. Marie is never sure about anything. Besides, she passed out. But are you sure? I think so. Then you're not? Yes, I am. I saw him. I'd know him anywhere. I know you're wrong. My brother would not do a thing like that. Maybe somebody who looked like him but not my brother. Are you calling me a liar? What do you want to do? Convict an innocent boy? You're making a big mistake, Miss Calhoun. But you haven't got the courage to admit it. Listen you. I know what I'm doing. I saw his face plain and he's the one. Then you are a liar. You get out of here. - You keep your hands off me. Do you hear? And I still say you're a liar. Duke. Knock it off. Did you have to tell her where to find Marie? Did you have to fight her and get her suspicions up? She likely thinks you're covering up something. Now I must sidetrack her. Duke, I didn't give anything away. - Shut up. Pack some things. You're going to hide out for a while. What about the trial? You'll be on hand. Hurry up. Be ready when I get back. Duke. Where are you going? To straighten out Marie. And the DA wants that gun. He says he's got a circle almost clean around the kid. And he only needs the gun to close it. - I can't find the gun. We searched the Ryan house thoroughly. We dug up the back yard. We took the garage apart. There's no gun. Unless you want me to comb every vacant lot in town and drag the river. Well, get it out of Ryan. - Yeah? He sticks to his story. You cannot shake him. You can't prove anything he says is true but he never varies it. I .. I don't know, Mac. I'm beginning to think we've got the wrong suspect. Listen, boy. It is elementary. The scarf. The truck. His pal's dying declaration. That's worth several witnesses in any court. And Clara Calhoun. She is very positive. - Yeah. She's a little too positive. Get this straight, Mickey. I'm not trying to eager-beaver a man into the gas chamber. I knew O'Hara well and so did you. Someone has to pay for him. But that someone has to be the guilty party. Exactly. And I am beginning to get a little shaky on Ryan. To me, he is it. It adds up. What do you want, photographs of the holdup? Why, this .. His sister is pretty, isn't she. That is no lie. Now wait, Mac. Don't jump to conclusions. I just got a feeling something is haywire. You turn over your dope to the DA's office. I need you on that Baxter bombing. That other witness, Marie Weston. She insisted the killer had dark hair. Did you hear me about the Baxter case? Look, Mac. Two days. - No. I need you too bad here. You can work on this when you're off-duty if you want to. Alright. I will. Thanks a lot, Captain. - Don't mention it, Sergeant. And don't foul up the DA's case. He is very anxious to get a quick conviction. Thank you. Are you still here, dear? My, but you are patient. I simply have to see Miss Weston. She didn't impress me as the reliable type when I hired her. Hello Rosie. Are you looking for Marie Weston too? - Yep. Well, she didn't come to work this morning. I waited since the shop opened. That probably means she won't come in at all. Do you know where she lives? - Yes. I've been there. No dice. Drive you home? I don't want to put you to any trouble. It's no trouble. It's on the way. I kinda like this. Glad you decided to let me take you home. You can come and see me any time you want to. Just come out and search our house again. Look, Rosie. I was just doing my job. Yes, I know. Men are so smug about 'duty'. What about Steve? Of course you could plant the gun in our yard and then dig it up again. I don't know what to think now. I'm not so sure that Steve is guilty. Are you serious? I couldn't take a joke at a time like this. I'm not joking, Rosie. Maybe I'll have some news for you soon. Then maybe I'll be glad to see you. Thanks for the lift. Hello Rosa. Hello mom. Anything new? Yes. There was a call. A mister .. Martin. At the Club Bombay wants you to call him. Who's he, Rosa? I never heard of him. Listen to this. 'You are not permitted to kill a woman who has injured you'. 'But nothing forbids you to reflect that she is growing older every minute'. 'You are avenged one thousand four hundred and forty times a day'. That is pretty good, eh Wilma? Pick the book you love best ducky and I'll see it's put in your coffin. How is the roulette going this evening? Crowded. The dame that lost 900 and took the pills came around okay. Good. Give her back a hundred for car fare. I could go to the coast for that. - I don't want any squawks. Did you find Clara Calhoun yet? No. I'm opening a new bookie spot in Brady Heights and I can use Calhoun. She is a good operator. What's the matter, gate-mouth? She give you the brush? The name is Duke. You petrify me. Grow up, sonny-boy. You can't settle everything with a gun, you know. Some people you must get along with. - I thought she was your babyface. Jackland, I don't like dames talking like that. Wilma is not a dame. Wilma is a lady. Aren't you, Wilma? Find Calhoun for me, Duke. I want to open next Monday. Okay. She'll probably show up in time for the trial. Where you going, sonny? - A date with a dish. Certain things give me the creeps. Like snakes and lizards and Duke Martin. Duke is an artist, buttercup. And occasionally. I need an artist. Se?or Martin. I was just going to call you. Miss Rosa Ryan? Mr Martin? What will you have to drink? I don't think I care to .. - Yes you would. Bring the lady a Manhattan. - Si, Se?or Martin. Thank you, Mr Martin. Dance? No. I didn't come here to dance. You said you want to talk .. - This is part of it, baby. You are beautiful, you know. Too beautiful. Is that why you asked me to come? - Don't interrupt. You're too beautiful to have a brother in the spot he's in. What do you know about my brother? How do you know about him? I read the papers. I also have other sources. I also don't like questions. Even from someone as pretty as you. I am sorry. I just .. - Okay. You know. I don't think your brother is guilty. My personal opinion, you understand. I just don't think he is the guy. Everybody else seems to think he is. Except mom and me. And me makes three. You know, in this business .. - Do you own this place? The manager. You know, in this racket you meet a lot of characters. Some are good, some are bad. Some are right guys. Some are wrong. Okay. You learn what they want you to learn. Sometimes you learn what they don't want you to learn. A character pulls a job. A lot of the guys may know about it but the cops may never know about it. It goes around the grapevine, see. But it never gets upstairs. If you know what I mean. Yes. I think I do. And you have no idea where Miss Calhoun went? No. I haven't, sir. She left no forwarding address. She said the holdup distressed her so terribly she had to go away for a rest. She left this box here with me and said she would come back for it later. Now, Mrs Atkins. You won't say a word to anyone about my having been here. No, sir. Not a word to anyone. You know, landladies have to keep secrets too sometimes. Is Mr Martin in? - He is here. But he is busy now, sir. Yeah. Too busy. A cigarette? Not right now. Thanks. I got a tip on the holdup. Please tell me. - Shut up. Did you ever hunt for gophers? Good target practice. They live in a hole in the ground. Very scared. Always hiding out. Okay. If a gopher pokes his head out to nibble some grass. Or make one little step. Or let his shadow fall. Gone. You know what I mean? Okay. The same with this deal. Everything I say keep it very quiet. If you don't .. No gopher. I will, Mr Martin. I am sorry, sir. But I cannot seat you without a reservation. There is my reservation. Hello duke. - Hi. Well, Mr Ferguson. I see you know Mr Martin. - Yeah. Our tracks cross from time to time. Several years ago that was. How are things these days? - On a cloud. What do you mean? Nothing. Mind if I sit down? Thanks. I am sorry, Miss Ryan. But business before pleasure. You know, it's too bad that you cannot arrange a 48-hour day. A friend of yours has disappeared. Yeah? I got a lot of friends. Clara Calhoun. Yeah. I got to find her. She is a witness in her brother's trial. Yeah? Where is she? There's a cop for you. A conversation means a lot of questions. How should I know? I gave her the brush about six months ago. What if I say you are wrong? That is your pitch. Tangle with the cops once and they never forget it. And they never let you forget it. I think you're right, Mr martin. Sure. Everybody is good inside. We have nothing else to do so we go out and find people to frame. It's true. He dug up our yard and searched our house to get something to convict Steve. His scarf, his truck. He did anything he could to put Steve where he is now. Why don't you leave me alone? Haven't you done enough harm? I had no idea you were here. I came here to see your 'friend'. Now, you want me to take you home? What? I should say not. I'm enjoying myself. Why don't you leave the lady alone? She is my guest. Go and peddle your troubles to the fire department. What are you up to, Martin? You see? Okay. Rosie, if you need any rat poison in a hurry let me know. How do you like that guy? You know him well, huh? I ought to. He makes his living searching our house. He kinda goes for you, huh? Does he? You're a dame, aren't you? Please, I do not like that word. Alright. Gal. Maybe he does. That's his business. I'll take that cigarette now. So you hate cops, huh? You bet I do. Maybe you do and maybe you don't. I ain't sure. Look, what do you want me to do? Go and shoot one to prove it to you? Take it easy, butch. That would only annoy them. He said something about Clara Calhoun. Was he right? Did she disappear? - Can't you talk without questions? Sorry. How should I know? About that tip. I think I will leave that up to you. That is the way it's got to be. Waiter. Thanks a lot, Duke. And call me the minute you find out anything. We got a date for tomorrow night? - We have. Wait a minute. Better give me your phone number. Gladstone 8-0-0-1. 8-0-0-1. You'll do your best, won't you Duke. - Sure. For you baby, anything. Oh, Missy. You scared me. That was a good act you put on tonight. It wasn't exactly an act. - No? Well .. partly. I saw Duke hated you and .. I had to keep his confidence. Are you dreaming? His kind never trusts anybody. Not even themselves. He trusts me. - Yeah? You don't know much about this guy. There's your pal. A nice record, huh? Will you stop playing with dynamite? If he ever turns on you .. - He promised he'd help Steve. How is it going to help Steve if we find you in a ditch some night? Look, Rosie. I don't want anything to happen to you. I'd do anything to help Steve. Anything. I don't care what happens to me. Oh. I guess that puts us on opposite sides of the fence. Haven't we always been? Maybe so. I had some news for you tonight but .. Under the circumstances I guess it had better wait. Goodnight, Rosie. Goodnight. She evidently held the purse in front of her. The last gesture of protection. The bullet went through it and through her. Did you get the slug? No. No bullet. No laundry marks on her clothing. No labels. How did you get such a quick identification? The FBI. She worked in a defense plant during the war. Her ankles were deeply creased. A piece of wire around one of them. She was weighted and thrown in the river. A fisherman's anchor broke the wire and up she came. Not much evidence to go on. - No. Did she have a record? No record. She was a witness in the O'Hara case. I guess somebody didn't like her attitude. Put that thing away, Duke. Put it away! Nerves, kid. Nerves. Bad. Duke. You don't love me no more, do you? Yeah, yeah. I love you. Why did you say that? You're giving me a bad time. Cracking up and drinking like a fish. If people give me a bad time I've got an easier way of taking care of them. Duke. Where's Marie? People should not scream. Duke, I cannot stand it here. I'm going nuts. Get me some decent clothes so I can .. So you can go to a bar and shoot your mouth off? I keep looking at these four walls. I keep thinking about that poor kid being framed. Maybe you'd rather I took the rap? No, Duke. No. But you said it would be easy. You said we'd get the money and go to Florida. Look, the kid is set for the gas chamber and his nosy sister's where I want her. And Ferguson is running around in circles like a bloodhound. You got just one job to do. Pull yourself together for the trial so you don't go to pieces on the stand. Look, baby. I'll take you out of here soon. We'll go away together to South America. Just you and me and a wad of dough. You'd like that wouldn't you? - Yeah. I got just one big killing to do first. Jackland has got a bad Saturday night habit. The dough from the bookie shops .. And the gambling take from the club is counted in his office on Saturday night. A happy guy. Thirty, forty grand. It gets on my mind. Think what that means in South America. - Don't Duke. Don't. You don't like this big idea? - It would only mean more trouble. You don't like this big idea. Okay, Duke. Yeah. Here. Food. No liquor. I got to get back to the club. Don't call me there no more. Look what you're doing. Ruining my cake. It isn't for you anyway. Sometimes people put guns in cakes. How stupid. Who could eat a cake with a gun in it? Okay, lady. Hello mum. Hi, Rosie. - Hello Steve. I'll be going, Steve. If you think of anything new, have the jailer call me. Stevie. Are you alright? - Sure. What did he want? He was giving me the old business. About being on my side. I think he is, Steve. - No. It's a trick they use. They play up to you and then try to find out things to use against you. I know. But this time I think he's really on our side. Then he's the only one around here who is. Sis. You aren't falling for that cop, are you? Mickey. Here's the dope you wanted on Clara Calhoun. That is where she is living now. - Thanks, Chubb. That's swell. Look. What's the idea of all this homework? Don't you have any fun? Calhoun told her story. She'll tell it in court. I don't believe her story. Why did she move to a hideout? The poor kid is just shy. She hates publicity. Yeah. I know. That's what she told her landlady. I don't believe that either. Did Duke Martin ever show up at this address? Nobody has ever seen him. What makes you think she's mixed up with Duke? No dame keeps a framed picture of a guy unless she is carrying a torch for him. If that's so, would she tell you what she knows about him? You don't think they trust each other, do you? It's my guess they both know Steve Ryan did not kill O'Hara. Now is the time to turn the heat on. That is elementary. Yeah. 740 Marine Avenue. - Right. Okay. So you gave her the brush-off six months ago, huh? Gave who the brush-off? Clara Calhoun. Make up with her again? I'm still working on that pitch. This is where she lives. You've been here before. I was glad to know she is still alive. If we find her in the river like Marie we'll know who to get in touch with. Alright driver. Let's go. Okay, Hold it, driver. Here. Pull up, will you. Duke. How did that copper find out you were here? What copper? Don't give me that. I met him coming out of the building. What did you tell him? I didn't see anyone. There was no copper here. Haven't you learned not to lie to me? Duke, I swear to you I'm not lying. I don't know who you're talking about. Mickey Ferguson. The guy on the O'Hara case. Why did he come here if it wasn't to see you? But he didn't see me. How did he know you were here if you didn't tip him off? He could have tailed you, couldn't he? Nobody tails me. Not tonight maybe. But some other time. I don't know how he found out. But I know I didn't tell him nothing. How do I know you're telling the truth? I am, Duke. Believe me. I wouldn't cross you. Haven't I proved that? Haven't I shown how much I love you? Don't give me that 'love' stuff. Well, what if he does know where I am? I got to show up at the trial, don't I? Yeah. What can you do about that? I don't know yet. When I make up my mind you'll hear from me. [ Door knocks ] What do you want? Haven't you caused me enough trouble? Get out of here. You'd better listen to me first. I don't want to hear anything you have to say. A lot of crust you've got. Look. I'm sorry if I got you in bad with Duke. But it's my guess all you ever got from that guy is trouble. If you stick to him that is all you ever get. Until the payoff comes. And that won't be pretty. Why don't you mind your own business? I think you've been lying about the guy who shot O'Hara. But I'd rather hear you lie some more at the trial than not to show up at all. What do you mean? You can call me any time you want to. I'm in the phone book. Call you? If you don't get me at the apartment, try this number: Gladstone 8-0-0-1. Keep it. They .. They found Marie in the river. She had been shot. I saw her at the morgue. I'd hate to see that happen to you. Duke, why don't you tell me the surprise? Always got the eagers, ain't you? Ain't those monkeys got a home? You with the fingers. Go home. Mr Martin, I haven't finished playing requests. Go home. Sorry kids. It's after closing. Okay, Wino. Tell the lady. I takes the truck from the alley. Picks up Kowalski. - Name? His Moniker is Cowie. He has the navy scarves. We go to Clara's joint's back door. Cowie has the shotgun. Me the Dickson. A 0.38. We go in. Clara is counting the dough. We draw down our guns on her and the other one. Name? - Marie. Cowie checks the front. I take the bookie dough. Marie screams. I hear the shotgun go off. I poke my head around. There's a copper at the front door. He shoots Cowie. I plugged the cop. Then we make the getaway. Cowie is hurt bad. I ditch him. And the truck in front of a doc's home. The gun? I pitched that in the drink. The dough? - The dough I spent. He is the one. Duke, this is wonderful. He sounds great, don't he? - You don't know what it means to me. Call the police right away. - Wait, baby. This will cost you a little dough. - Why? I'll get it on my insurance. 300 bucks. It took a lot of time and effort to dig him up. Okay. But call the police. Take it easy, baby. Here's the pitch. Meet me here tomorrow night. We pick up Wino. Go to the Daily Star and you turn him in. The paper has got a great Sunday morning spread. 'Accused kid sister finds the real killer'. 'Sets her brother free and makes fools of the cops'. Why can't we call them now? Take it easy, Butch. A few things I must think over first. And keep this to yourself. Or no gopher. Remember? Here. Bring my car around the front. I'll drive you home. Duke. I don't want nothing to go haywire and the cops pin this on me for real. How can they? You were in Kansas City. You got 14-carat proof. Yeah. That's right, Duke. I don't get this whole deal. - You don't have to. Go to the station. Turn yourself in. The cops give you 3 days and set you free. And you get 50 bucks. Enough to buy yourself a car-load of wine. Fifty livres. Don't cross me. I'm playing a joke on the dame. Giving her a fancy run around. Duke. Who pulled the Calhoun heist? The kid the cops got on ice. Her brother, Steve Ryan. Oh. My, don't we look lovely. Thanks. We got your boyfriend in this morning. Mr Martin? - Yeah. Don't worry. We turned him loose again. Couldn't get anything out of him about Clara Calhoun. We did not want to keep you two apart. Thanks. How come he's taken such a sudden interest in you anyway? Is there anything strange in that? - I don't know. Where will you be, dear? Club Bombay. I think. See you later. Who is this Mr Martin? He's the kind they build jails for. Clara. Give me Gladstone 8-0-0-1. "Deposit ten cents for five minutes please." Hello? Hello. This is Clara Calhoun. I've been thinking about what you said the other night at my apartment. I was lying about what happened at the holdup. Marie was right. Both bandits have black hair. Would you sign a statement to that effect? Yeah. I can't let that kid go to the gas chamber. Alright. We'll give you protection then. Where are you now? I'm calling from the drugstore on the corner. Can you meet me at my apartment? Hello? Hello? Operator, I've been cut off. I was talking to Gladstone 8-0-0-1. Hello. We were cut off. Yes I know. Where shall I meet you? Your apartment. Alright. I'll be there as soon as I can make it. Twenty minutes. Okay. Duke. [ Gunshot! ] Duke. Anybody got a phone? - Yes. I have. Duke. - Yeah? Everybody gone home? Yeah. Wilma has gone too, huh? - Yes. Where you been? Folding parachutes. Hmm. A funny man, eh? A big take, huh? The best in weeks. That big handicap was made in heaven. Where's Rosie? She said she would be back in twenty minutes. She said she had a date with you. How long ago did she go? About fifteen minutes. Did I ever tell you about the guy I killed in Detroit? No. I worked for him. He didn't treat me right. We were just talking like this. Like you and me are. You know? Take a look. The bullet on the left killed O'Hara and on the right Calhoun. The same gun. The same perfume. Here. Keep this as evidence. Call MacTaggart, will you Doc? I want a raiding squad, Club Bombay. Duke. Yeah? Oh. Duke. Say, we'd better hurry and pick up that man and get to the newspaper. Where have you been? Home. To get the money in my coat. That's your story. What about Calhoun? She had your phone number. I heard her talking to you. Duke, what's the matter with you? You double-crossed me, huh? Nobody makes a sucker out of me. Okay. That is six. Drop your gun and come on out. [ Gunshot! ] Rosie. Rosie. Ferguson. One of you boys call an ambulance. Hello, Mac. Oh. There's your guy who killed O'Hara. Here he is. Hi, mom. Gee, it's good to be home. Welcome home, Steve. Come on into the kitchen everybody. We're having a party. Isn't it wonderful to have him home again. Well, come on. - Wait a minute. I want to know something first. Have you changed your mind about cops just a little? Well, I suppose you have to make a living somehow. Yes. I think I've changed my mind. ..r-o..
