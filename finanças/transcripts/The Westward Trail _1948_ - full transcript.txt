You're the Howards, I take it? Yes, I'm Ann Howard, and this is my brother Tom. Welcome to prairiesville. My name's taggert, I run the local livery. There's your team and buckboard, I've been takin' care of 'em since you bought the ranch. That's very nice of you. How much do I owe you? Don't worry about that now. Come on, son, I'll help you with the baggage. You must visit US when we're settled. I sure will, miss Howard. Heeyah! Heeyah! Heeyah! Whoa! So this is what you spent our last $1500 for. It's not so bad, Tom. I'll bet his place hasn't been lived since buffalo bill was a kid. I have a feeling we've been followed. What are you talking about? Even in the stage coach I could have sworn somebody was following US. With your imagination, you oughta be writing storybooks. The only thing that's followed US is a cloud of dust, and even that had more sense than to hang around a place like this. Let's get our luggage and see what the rest of this mess looks like. If you want my advice, sell this place as fast as you can and go back east where we belong. When I want your advice, I'll ask for it. You seem to have forgotten why we came out here. I know, I know. You didn't like my friends in Chicago. "Friends"? A few more months with them and you'd have ended up in jail. That's what youthink. [ Singing in distance ] I suppose they threw in a cowboy singer with this place. He must be the caretaker. ♪ Gee, what a wonderful pal ♪ but it so happens ♪ she meant more to me ♪ she used to be ♪ my old gal ♪ and so if ever ♪ you see her ♪ tell her I said hello ♪ and that no matter what happens ♪ ♪ I'm for Cathy ♪ for I love her so ♪ whatever happened to Cathy ♪ gee, what a wonderful pal ♪ but it so happens ♪ she meant more to me ♪ she used to be ♪ my old gal ♪ and so if ever ♪ you see her ♪ tell her I said hello ♪ and that no matter what happens ♪ ♪ I'm for Cathy ♪ for I love her so Ann: That was beautiful. Thank you, ma'am. I didn't know you were listening. Are you the caretaker? No, I'm not. You're trespassing on private property. Get your things and get out. Wait a minute, young fella. I'm Ann Howard and this is my brother, Tom. We bought this property and we've just arrived from Chicago. Are you gonna get out or do I have to throw you out? Big talk from such a small potato. I'm Eddie Dean and this is my pal, soapy Jones. We usually stay here when we're in these parts. No damage done, and we'll get out right away. I'm sure there's been no damage done. And my brother and I will be glad to see you if you stop by this way again. I'm not so sure about that. Don't you like it out here? I just want to get as far away from here as I can. You better change your ways, young fella, this is tough territory. You'll have your hands full takin' care of your sister. Is that a warning? No, just a piece of advice. It's a pleasure to see a lady in these parts. If you ever need any help, don't hesitate to call on me. The only help she'll need is to get rid of this place. I don't think she'll have much trouble with that. In case you do decide to sell, let me know. I'm interested in all the land around here. Selling is Tom's idea, not mind. I started this and I intend to finish it. We won't be far away in case you want anything. Come on, soapy. The sooner you accept the fact that we're here to stay, the better off you'll be. And the sooner you learn you can't tell me what to do, the better off you'llbe. I'll bet that cowboy would've bought this place from you. I'll put up the team. Hello, sheriff. Howdy, Larson. What can I do for you? I just stopped in to get some information. I hear the Smith ranch has been sold. Eastern folk. A girl named Ann Howard and her brother, Tom. Paid $1500 for it and I notarized the deed. Did they get here yet? Got in on the stage this morning. I sure hope they don't have any trouble. They won't. I'll get to the bottom of those threats to the ranchers. You do? I can't figure out why this gang wants to set up the property around here. Just yesterday Benson received a letter warning him to sell his land or else. What do you think? Sounds pretty bad. I hope you get your man. I'll get him -- you can bet on that. Stop by the silver palace and I'll buy you a drink. Hart, you and the boys come over to the palace. We've got some talking to do. You know, Eddie, I sure with those two hadn't decided to come out west. I don't know, she's a pretty nice girl. Aw, I'm not denyin' that she's nice, but if she hadn't come out here, we'd be in there right now instead of under this tree. Ha ha! You must be gettin' old, soapy. [ Gunshots ] Now what?! Those shots are coming from the Benson place! Come on! Sheriff mcneill said he'd be around to help US, and here he is! Do you know who they were? No, but there was five of 'em. The sheriff went after them. Sheriff! Who were they? [ Weakly: ] Same gang that's been causing the trouble. Their leader is... Larson. All we have to do now is round up Larson. How we gonna convict him? You can't get evidence out of a dead man. We'll have to dig it up some other way. I call. Let's see 'em. Four new aces, boys. I'm quitting. You want to sit in? This is a very lucky chair. No, thanks. Been here all afternoon, Larson? Just about. Why? Sheriff mcneill was a good friend of mine. He was a good friend of mine, too. I was at the raid on the Benson place this afternoon. What's that got to do with me? Just before the sheriff died, he mentioned your name. Are you accusing me of shooting the sheriff? What do you think? Are we all through, Eddie? Yeah! Well, let's go! I came out to pay you folks a visit. That's very nice, Mr. Larson. Are you planning on buying cattle? Eventually, yes. The price we paid for the ranch took nearly all our savings. It took allof our savings, and now that we have it, perhaps you can tell US what we're going to do with it. I hope to make the place pay for itself. And in the meantime? I'm going to plant a rock garden and grow cactus. I can't say I blame Tom too much, miss Howard. Raising cattle is a pretty expensive proposition. I didn't expect it to be easy. And there's been a lot of trouble around here lately. Only this afternoon sheriff mcneill was killed in a gunfight. And you said you wanted to leave the east because I was getting into bad company. We ought to pack up and get out of here tomorrow! Your brother may be right. I tell you what I'll do. I'll give you $2000 for this property, and I'll give it to you in cash first thing tomorrow morning. Take it and let's get out of here! That's a profit of $500 right now! I appreciate your offer, but I have no intention of selling. I don't think you realize what you're getting yourself into. I'm quite capable of taking care of myself. If you'll excuse me, Mr. Larson, I have work to do. I'm sorry, miss Howard. Maybe you'll change your mind later. What's wrong with you?! This is probably the last chance we'll have to sell this property! A few more shooting and we won't be able to give it away. You're wasting your breath. Tom: Mr. Larson! Pay no attention to my sister. She's just a headstrong kid who won't admit she's wrong. Then it's up to you to change her mind. Don't worry, I intend to. Now you're talking sense. I knew when I first saw you that you were a young fella with a head on his shoulders. Meet me in town tomorrow. My office is in the silver palace. Bring the deed to the property and I'll have the money. I'll be there. Good. With sheriff mcneill dead, prairieville has no law and order at all. Maybe they'll elect a new sheriff. Nobody'll take the job. It'll make things easy for those landgrabbers. I think sheriff mcneill would have liked for you to take his place. Maybe so, but a man just doesn't appoint himself sheriff. I guess you're right. Look! Miss Howard's in trouble! And with her brother, at that. Come on, let's go! Get out of the buckboard and give me that deed! I'm gonna sell it and you can't stop me! Heeyah! What's wrong, miss Howard? I ought to give your brother a good whoopin'! He's not bad, really. I thought surely if I brought him out west he'd change, but I just can't do it alone. Maybe we can help. Where's he headed? He's gone into prairieville to turn our property deed over to Chuck Larson. Is it in your name? Yes, it is. But I didn't sign it, and Tom said he's going to forge my signature. So that's what Larson came out to see you about. If I turn Tom over to the authorities, he'll be arrested as a forger, and if he isn't stopped, he'll have the property sold to Larson before the day is out. Don't worry, he won't get your property. What are you going to do? Just leave everything to US. Is Mr. Larson in? You Tom Howard? Yes. Right in there. He's expecting you. [ Knocking ] Come in. What can I do for you, Tom? I got my hands on the deed. This deed's in your sister's name and it's not signed. Don't worry about that. I'll sign for her. You're pretty anxious to get your hands on some money. I'm anxious to get out of this hole. There you are, $1250, payment in full. You said you were going to pay me $2000! I changed my mind, it ain't worth that much. You're nothing but a crook! Tom! Tom! Snap out of it! What happened? Larson punched me -- got away with the deed! Did you sign it? Yes. There's one born in every family, and you're both of 'em! Looks like we've lost him. Just disappeared into thin air. Tom, head for your ranch. We'll follow you. I can't go back to the ranch now -- what am I gonna say? You shoulda thought of that -- you're going back if I have to drag you. You and who else? Soapy: Me. Heeyah! Eddie, we shoulda made him walk, he'll never stop that team. I guess you're right. Eddie: Whoa! Whoa! Kinda got away from you, son. Why don't you leave me alone? Because I still think there's hope for you. Soapy, watch my horse. I'll do the driving from now on. Move over. I guess I oughta thank you for stopping the team for me. That's all right. You could be a lot of help to your sister if you wanted to. I don't know anything about this country. You could learn. I think between soapy and me, we could teach you how to handle yourself. That would be great. All right, you and me are gonna have a talk, and we might as well start right now. Soapy, head for the ranch, we'll follow. I've been a fool, Ann. Eddie told me Larson wants this property because they've discovered silver around here. So that's why you came back -- you haven't changed a bit. But we'll be rich! That's true -- I've known about it for a long time. It seems to me that youmade me an offer for this property. I said I was interested in allthe land around here. I can explain that. I'm waiting. You see, I was -- apparently you can't trust anybody around here. You don't understand -- Eddie wants to help US. Larson tried to buy the property for $1250, and I refused to accept the money. Then where's the deed to the property? Larson got away with it. We tried to follow him and lost him. That's a flimsy story -- losing Chuck Larson. He knows this country -- he probably has a hideout. I don't care what he has. All I know is that the deed is gone, you forged my name, and for all I know, you two stood there and watched him do it. Eddie did everything he could to stop it, but we were just too late. I'm sorry you feel the way you do. Larson hasn't heard the last of this, and you can bet your last dollar on that! My last dollar is gone, so if there's any betting to be done, you'd better do it. Eddie. I'm sorry, Ann. Go away and leave me alone. I don't care what happens anymore. Tom:Eddie! I'm...I'm sorry, I tried to explain, but she wouldn't listen. I understand. You can never tell about women. Where you fellas goin'? Back to camp. Could I go along? Sure, come on. I'm sure Dean knows about the silver strike. That means the whole countryside will find out about it. Yeah. I want Benson's place and all the rest of the property around here. How about the Howard ranch? I'll take care of that on my own. Did Tom Howard give you trouble? I'm takin' over the job of sheriff. He gives US trouble, I'll throw him in jail on a forgery charge. That's all, boys, you've got your orders. Wait a minute, Tom, wait a minute. You are not driving a milk wagon, you are riding a horse -- understand? Don't jerk him around like that, give him his head, let him go. All right, I'll race you back to camp. That's a deal. When I count three, take off. Ready? Yup. One, t-t-t- one, t-t-t -- just a minute. One, t-t-t-two, three! How am I doing, Eddie? Great, Tom. In a few days you'll be able to teach soapy how to ride. I'm going into town, I'm expecting some mail. Soapy, give Tom another lesson on how to handle a 6-shooter. It might come in handy the next couple of days. Since no one has volunteered to take the sheriff's place, I feel it's my duty as a law-abiding citizen to see that the people of prairieville have protection. Buck mcneill was my friend, and I aim to bring his murderer to justice. Any of you who have trouble with rustlers, poachers, landgrabbers, come to me. Is that clear? [ All agreeing ] And anybody who's looking for trouble will find it right here in my office. Is that clear, Dean? Very clear, Larson. I'm sure you know exactly what you're doing. That's all, boys. I'm Eddie Dean. Any mail for me? I believe there is one for you. Here you are.Thanks! If you're lookin' for trouble, you've come to the right place. I want the deed to Ann Howard's property. You're out of luck. It'd be easier for you if you just turn it over. You make trouble, and I'll make it tough on the girl. Tom Howard forged his sister's name to that deed, and I'll testify in court to put him behind bars. All right, have it your way for the time being, but remember -- don't make any mistakes. Mr. Benson, all you ranchers have to get together and settle this thing once and for all. Funny thing, Dean -- half an hour ago there was a group of men here sayin' the same thing. None of them spoke very highly about you. You can't think I had anything to do with shooting the sheriff or threatening the ranchers. All we know is that buck mcneill is dead, and we received some more threatening letters. We know you didn't shoot mcneill, but that doesn't mean you weren't involved. You're both on the wrong trail. We'll be the judge of that. You better be gettin' along. Miss Howard, I -- you arrived right on schedule, just the way Mr. Larson' friends said you would. Listen to me -- Larson and his gang are trying to frame me. They told me you'd say that. But Larson's got the deed to your property! Mr. Larson will give me the deed anytime I ask him for it. He's sure got you buffaloed, hasn't he? As a matter of fact, he's coming out here today to talk it over with me. Your brother -- I'm not interested in my brother Tom, or you either, for that matter. Good day! That's the story. Larson has convinced everybody that he's a straight-shooter. He's now sheriff of prairieville. With all the trouble that's been going on, people are willing to believe anything. You just can't sit here and take it, Eddie. I thought that letter I got today would fix things up, but my hands are still tied. I'm going down to see Ann. It won't do any good. Maybe Tom couldn't do any good, but I think I can. She's a mighty proud filly, but I know how to handle her. Don't you fellas do anything until I get back. What was in that letter you received today? I think I can trust you. [ Whistles ] Now you see why my hands are tied. But orders are orders -- we'll just sit tight until soapy gets back. Oh, it's you. Howdy, ma'am. Whatever you want, the answer is no. You got me all wrong, miss Howard, I don't want anything. Fact of the matter is I'm gonna give you something. These were worn by little beaver, she was in Indian Princess of the blackfoot tribe. I've had 'em since I was a boy. Are you trying to bribe me? Who, me? Ha ha ha! I wouldn't think of such a thing. Nobody asked you in! What do you think about these beads? The Indian squaw that wore 'em was a mighty pretty girl. Only trouble was, her husband liked to scalp people. One day, he tried to pick on me, and it was a question of his scalp or mine. So I was a young, strong man with a lot of good years ahead of him, so I had to think fast. Well, we went at it hammer and tongs. I was a lot stronger in them days, so I picked him up, grabbed him by the neck and I twisted his head and twisted again -- so we fought from one tepee to the other, through his wigwam and that wigwam, and then I smashed him like this -- [ grunting ] I was just about ready to break him in two, we fought all over that place for 3 1/2 hours -- how long? 2 1/2 hours. How long? 10 minutes. Anyhow, so I was getting the best of him and his wife is out there and she see what's going on so she rushes up to me and says, "if you'll just let my husband go, "I'll give you anything I got." So I spied the beads around her neck, and so I said to her, "I'd rather have the beads than your husband's scalp," so I took 'em and we shook hands and I went on my way. And I figured that you might like to have 'em. Of all the fantastic stories I've ever heard... All joking aside, you've got Eddie all wrong. You really don't believe he's mixed up in this, do you? I don't want to, but -- Eddie is an honest, square-shootin' cowboy, and he thinks the world of you. He's turned that kid brother of yours from an eastern dude with bad ideas into a right thinking westener. Tom is a changed boy, and you've got Eddie to thank for it. If that were only true. It is true, believe me! Maybe I've been too hard with Eddie. Now you're talkin' sense. [ Knocking ] Hello, miss Howard. You two know each other, I take it. I'll be going now, miss Howard -- remember what I told you. I will, soapy. Just as I was making real progress, in walked Larson. And that ended that, eh, soapy? Just goes to show you can't tell a dad-blamed thing about a woman. Why blame Ann? You gotta blame somebody. As I said before, miss Howard, if you want the deed to this place back, I can bring it out Saturday night. Naturally, I'd like it kept in a safe place. There's no safer place than the sheriff's office. I think it might be better if you brought it back to me. You know I want this place very badly, miss Howard. I think I know why, now. What do you mean? Isn't there a little matter of silver? I don't know what you're talking about. I believe you do. Let's put all the cards on the table -- I've got the deed to this property with your signature forged to it by your brother. Either you see things my way, or he'll end up in jail. Don't threaten me! Now get out of here! You forget -- this is my property now. You've got until Saturday night to think it over. It's a long shot, but it's our only chance. I've got to talk to Ann. Maybe she won't want to talk to you. That's what's got me worried. Hey, I think I got it, just leave it to me. Aren't we coming along with you? No, but you can watch if you want to -- from a distance. This,i gotta see. Come on, Tom!

Why, certainly. You're not planning on leaving prairieville? Yes, I'm going home. Why? It was a mistake to come here in the first place. I'm tired of all this plotting and scheming and never knowing what's going to happen. That doesn't sound like you, I had you figured you as a fighter. Sit down and listen to me for a moment. I've known about Larson and his gang for a long time. Why didn't you warn me? I couldn't. I'm not even supposed to talk about it now, but I can't see you sacrifice everything. I was sent to prairieville for a very special reason. The government has been watching this area for some time, we've known all along that men would try to grab all the land around here in the hope of cashing in before people found out about the silver. That's why I'm here. You can see for yourself how important it was to keep that fact a secret. And all the time I thought you were mixed up with Larson. It's part of my job to keep people guessing. But Larson told me himself he wants this property, and from the looks of things, he won't stop at anything to get it. I think I have a way of stopping Larson, but I need your help. All right, tell me what I can do. Now you're talking. I've given Ann a plan of action. She's going to do her part, and we have to do ours. Soapy, you go see Benson and the people in that section. Tom, you take the opposite direction. I'll take the rest of the territory. And don't come back until your job is done. If you want to get rid of trouble once and for all, you'll stick to Dean and me! Okay, it's a deal. I want to hang onto my land as badly as you do. Either we all stick together, or we lose out. You with me? We're with you. [ Knocking ] Larson: Come in. Well, this is a surprise. I'm sorry I lost my temper the other day. Have you changed your mind about things? Yes, if you come over to the ranch tomorrow we can talk things over. Bring the deed along, and I'm sure we can make a deal. All right, I'll be there. Good night. Soapy, you and Tom stay here and wait for the signal. I'm ridin' down closer. No matter what happens, stay away until I give you the high sign. Right. Good luck, Eddie. More coffee? No thanks. That's the best food I've eaten in a long time. Did you bring the deed? Yes, I brought it. Let's get down to business. You're a rare combination -- brains, beauty, and plenty of fight. You and I could go a long way together. What would you say if I asked you to marry me? Marry you? Yes. We could build an empire out here together. All you have to do is say the word. Eddie must be in trouble, I'm going down there. Wait a minute, Tom, you heard what Eddie said. Just keep your shirt on till he gives US the sign. That's it. Soapy: Let's go, men! Stay where you are, Dean -- get over there! [ Panting ] Now we'll finish what you started, Dean. Yippee! That's the way I like to see 'em, Eddie! Where's the rest of the gang? We got 'em all wrapped up and ready for the hoosegow. Good for you! That's right! Good for me! That was a mighty fine meal and we certainly enjoyed it. It was very poor payment for what you've done for US. It's just part of our job. Soapy, if we're going to get to red rock before sundown we'd better be on our way. Eddie, we thought you'd like some music before you left. Am I supposed to take that as a hint? Please do! Sing US a song before you leave. Soapy, let's give 'em a realshow.
