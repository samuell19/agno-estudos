(gentle music) (door slamming) (gate rattling) - [Boy] Eat my dust! (indistinct radio chatter) - [Radio Announcer] It's springtime. Oh yeah, I can feel it in my bones. So get out there, clean your house, plant your garden, fall in love. Oh yeah, hey, wait. I almost forgot. We're louder, can you tell? We got a new antenna that's taller than the old antenna and that means we're really louder! So loud with our cool new 300 foot antenna that they can out hear us in what, Europe! Oh yeah, so we're gonna play what? Something European, yeah. - [Wayne] Well raise your bow rate. Mystery gadget. Take your time. - [Danny] No, no. I can see it, still low. (gentle radio music) - [Wayne] Would you just shut up? I'm gonna shoot you next. I'm gonna beat you, Danny. - Must have been the Kryptonite in your tomato soup, Clark. Now you're looking at oh, good 20 feet. A wind factor of co... co something. - The only wind around here is coming outta your mouth. (arrow swooshing) Where is it? - Bullseye. Yeah, I think it's just buried deep. I got loins of power wind. - I got your loin hanging. (arrow swooshing) - [Wayne] I don't see any arrows in the bullseye. - [Danny] What are you talking about? Look right through. Watch, I'll do it again. (man coughing) - I don't see it. - I do, it's right in the bullseye. - Bull tweety. - [Danny] Take a deep breath, hold it. (arrow swooshing) (arrow swooshing) (man shouting) - Danny! Stop shooting! - [Danny] Dad, dad! - [Wayne] Mr. Earl! (man groaning) - Get the ladder, boys! - [Danny] Hang on! (man groaning) - Ruth, call a doctor. - Come on Danny, move it! - Okay dad, all right. Wrong way. - [Wayne] What do you think I'm doing? - What's the matter with you son? Weren't you watching your arrows? It went right through Mr. Langer's window. - You killed Papa Langer! - These are to help you sleep. - Ed, get me a shot of Old Crow. - Dad, I really don't think you should have any whiskey. - Get it. - You shouldn't have any spirits in your condition. - What's the difference? I'm as near a spirit as I'm ever gonna get. (glass clinking) - Don't get excited. You'll only start bleeding again. - Out! - I'm very sorry about this, Mr. Langer. I'm sure the boy didn't mean it. - Where is he? - I didn't mean to stick you like that. I'm sorry. - Come here, boy. I was dreaming about Indians. The Joppa Road out there was an Indian trail 200 years ago. Did you know that, boy? - Yes sir, my dad told me. - You ain't a ghost, come back to put me out of my misery are you? - No sir. - Too bad. - Is old man Langer really dying? - Mr. Langer, Danny. Ed says he came home to die. - To die, to sleep, to sleep perchance to dream. Aye, there's the rub. - Why does she keep doing that? - That is Hamlet, snot head. - Stop it. Both of you. - So where'd Mr. Langer come from? - Oh, I don't know, Danny. South America, I think. He used to work on bridges and stuff for the government. - What's he dying of? - Old age, I guess. - Can I go to his funeral? - He isn't dead yet, Danny. - Why do you want to go to his funeral? - I missed mom's. - You were two. Spitting up was one of your hobbies. - Shh, shh, shh. Why do you wanna go to his funeral, bud? - I've never seen anybody dead before. - Grim death. How foul and lonesome is thine image. - I gotta be excused before she makes me puke. - [Dad] Where are you going? - Woods. - [Dad] What about your homework? - Tomorrow's Saturday, dad. - Oh, Danny, I don't want you playing around on that tower, all right? I'm serious. It's, it's coming down soon, so stay away from it. - Okay, dad. There's something wrong. There's nobody here. - [Wayne] Maybe we got the wrong date. - No, it's the 11th. - [Wayne] Is this it? - It looks about right. - You think there'd be blood or something. - Geez, it was three years ago. All the blood and guts would've been washed out by now. - They should have put up a marker or something. - Nobody around here knew him well enough. - Winds out of the Northeast. It ain't good time for it. - There ain't no wind to speak of. Except what's coming outta your mouth. (gentle music) (coughing) (boy laughing) - You jerks! - Shut up! - What's he doing up there? - What do you think he's doing? You blind? - Not tonight. You gotta wait until the 23rd. Get down! (gun clicking) (Danny screaming) - All right, I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! - Stop it, Tommy. They knock it down on the 24th. You try the night of the 23rd at 7:30. That's the rule. - Who made that up? - I did, douche bag. - Yeah, but the last couple of years guys tried the day the kid from Hamilton fell. - Not anymore. Everybody gets one last shot on the day before they tear it down. Don't let me hear you tried before. - He ain't gonna try nothing. He's too scared. Runs in the family, don't it? - Yeah, he's got the same yellow streak as his old man. - Kiss my-- (Danny gasping) - The 23rd, not before. If I catch him up here before the 23rd, I'll kick his butt. - What a child. (Ain't That a Shame) - I've had it! Going after the Schoonis tomorrow. - You got a screw loose. They'll murder you. - Yeah well, if I get back them I'll die happy. - Don't look good. Northeast winds almost all month, especially around the 23rd. Plus you got your thunderstorms to think on this time of year. - Ain't no wind gonna make no difference. - You don't know that. Nobody knows how strong it gets once you're above the tree line. At least nobody alive knows. - I'm climbing it, Wayne. No matter what. How do you know those are your dad's ashes? Couldn't they have gotten mixed up with some other dead guy's? - No way. After he blew up the first commie tank, he started to throw a grenade at another commie tank and a flame thrower got him. Cooked him on the spot. So a friend of his put what was left in his helmet and brought him home. - I thought you said he was shot by a machine gun? - Yeah, that was before the flame thrower got him. - [Danny] For bravery in action. - Don't be a dork. I'd rather have a live coward for a dad than a dead brave one in a jar. Hey, pop. How you doing in there? - Stop that! Your mom will kill you. - She ain't here. Friday's date night. (urn lid rattling) - Careful. I dropped him all over the floor once. He vacuums up real easy. - Right now, let's see what we're having for lunch today. And we're having today for lunch, grilled cheese sandwich. (whistling) - You know, you look just like your mom tonight. - Really? - Yes, you do. Have a good time, sweetheart. - Thanks, dad. - I'll pick you up if you call. - Daddy, I'm only going two blocks. - You smell like Woodside Drugstore. - Can't you ever be civilized? - The Woodside Drugstore smells good. - Danny, Soupy Sales is on. - I'm just gonna go up and listen to the game. - Hey, I'm gonna go to the VFW tomorrow and I'm gonna ask about baseball, okay? - They're not gonna let me play. - Why not? - 'Cause you weren't in the war. - A lot of people weren't in the war, Danny. - Not in this neighborhood. - Come on, bud. I thought you were dying to play ball? - I don't want you to have to beg. - I'm not begging. You petition them it's called. Hey, they're gonna let you play. With your speed they'd be dummies not to. (indistinct television chatter) - [Radio Announcer] One ball, two strike. Kelly's 0 for two to strike out so far tonight. Got him on a nasty slow curve, here's the pitch. Look out! (indistinct radio chatter) (gentle music) (gun firing) (dog barking) (gun firing) - [Man] The war's over Jack! Go to bed! (gun firing) - Get down! (gun firing) (door slamming) Okay, show's over. Go on back to bed. - Daddy, why does he keep doing it? - Honey, I don't know. Hey Danny, where are you going? - Um, hiking. - Listen, stay off the ladder til I get a chance to check it out. I think it dry rotted this winter. - Okay. - Be careful. - Yeah. - [Ed] Earl? - Hey Ed. - Here's the petition. 25 signatures, the whole damn neighborhood. - I still don't get how I got picked. - You're gonna see them anyway. About baseball for Danny, right? Plus you guys got a good chance of catching a stray bullet over there. - You're the ones who took one a couple months ago. - It hit the chimney. I think he and his wife were up 'cause he was passing out. - Ed, you were in the service. I don't know anything about guns. - All you need to know is that Jack McLaskin has got to stop getting drunk and firing his rifle in his front yard. - Come on, be honest. I got picked because I'm a widower. Right. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (fast paced music) - Danny, here they come. (indistinct chatter) - All right, get behind the tree, now! - Might as well give up, hurry up! - What comes up must come down. - Don't seem to be much of a problem. Hell, we can use him. I've seen your boy climbing stuff here in the neighborhood. That boy can move. - If he can go as fast on the horizontal as he can on the vertical, we ought to kick ass this season. (chuckling) - Yeah, he's fast all right, he's... Well he'll do right by the team, you put him anywhere in the outfield. - How's you're heart? - What? - Your heart. - What about it? - You had a heart murmur. Right? Isn't that why you didn't serve? - My heart's fine. - Must be. Can't have a bad ticker and work on them tall buildings, can you? - Jack, what's this got to do with the team? - Nothing much. Except if we got a kid whose old man served his country then that kid is gonna play. And your kid's gonna sit. - Hold on. If we say the boy plays, ain't nobody gonna throw him off if another kid comes out of the woodwork. - That don't seem right. - Well, what's the verdict guys? Does he play or not? - Hell he plays. Come on Jack. We had extra outfielders last year. We need him. - All right, practice starts in a week. First game, Saturday after Memorial day. - Thanks guys. - Earl. - Jack, could I talk to you for a second in, in private? - My pleasure. (paper rustling) No goddamn draft dodger is gonna tell me what to do in my own yard. - Well, your bullets don't stay in your yard, Jack. That's what this is all about. - You got no idea what this is about. Oh, what was that? Is that a heart murmur? Or did you just crap in your pants? (kids shouting) (cheerful music) (boy screaming) (boy groaning) (sighing) - You're dead! (lively music) I'm gonna kill you! (boy grunting) You're not gonna get away with this, Hines! - [Older Boy] I'll get him. (Danny panting) - Yeah! (Danny screaming) - Danny, Danny! Danny. (thunder rumbling) - Over here, dammit. - [Langer] Come on! Come on! Broken arm. - Yes, sir. - Better than a broken head. - I guess. - Thought you were gonna die? - When I fell? Yeah. (slow music) - What was it like? - What do you mean? - Did that stuff happen? Like your whole life flashing by? - No. - I knew that was horse hockey. - But I didn't really die. Maybe that only happens when you really do die. - You must have felt something. - I felt... I don't know. It was kinda sad. - Son. I want you to help me get a gun. (phone ringing) - [Girl] It's for me. - I got it. Hello? Yes, Mr. Langer. No, no, that shouldn't be a problem at all. No, it's the least he can do, sir. I'll send him right over. Okay. Danny? (coughing) - Keep coming. Come on. - What I got ain't catching. Sit down, take a load off. Why'd you run away the first time? - I don't know. - Because I'm dying. - I guess. (coughing) - It hurts, you know. - What, what hurts? - Dying hurts, boy. What do you think I'm talking about? - Why do you need a gun? - You look like a smart kid. Why do you think I need one? Man shouldn't die a piece at a time. Upstairs, Ed's closet. Bottom right corner. There's a shoebox. Inside it is what I need. - I, I can't do that. - Why not? - Well, I don't know. It's against my religion or something. - Then there ain't never been a God died of cancer. Hey, You owe me. - Well, I gotta think about it. - You gotta think about it. Didn't have to think about drilling me with an arrow. - Yeah, I know, but I mean that was an accident. - Hey, get your young ass into the kitchen. Top shelf, above the fridge. Old Crow. Pour three, or four with your fingers, into a warm glass. Do it! (man coughing) - So what kind of cancer you got? - Lung. (man coughing) - When are you gonna die? - Soon enough. You Catholic? - Yes, sir. - Just my luck. You'd have to be a damn macro snapper, wouldn't you? - Sorry. - Look, go on upstairs. See if you can find it. Ain't no sin in that. - But if you want it so bad, why don't you just go get it yourself? - 'Cause getting up there, it would kill me. - Isn't that the whole idea? - You don't get it. You're just a damn kid. - I'm 12 years old. - I wanna die like a man. I'd be embarrassed to die coughing on my own lungs. Ain't seemly. - But maybe it's God's will. (chuckling) - Oh great! Like it's God will you spearing my ass? Like I don't have enough pain just dying. Oh, God figured what the hell? Let's wing the old coup with a god damned hunting arrow. - All right, I'll go upstairs. I'll see if the gun's there, but I am not bringing it down for you. (slow music) - Why don't you get the raspberry ones with the little beans on the top? - Beans? You mean raisins, don't you honey? - Ed, I mean what I mean. And it's your job to figure it out. (door closing) (lively radio music) - [Langer] Well? - It's not there. - Well, damn it all to hell! (coughing) What's wrong? - Miss Ruth's home. - Swell. - She almost caught me in the closet. - Hey, you look like you just saw a ghost. Or maybe your first pair of titties. - Seen 'em in magazines. - But not the real thing. She got a set on her, don't she? Yeah, that whole package is pretty damn sweet. Even the dying man can see that. - Mr. Langer, that's your own daughter-in-law. - Daughter-in-law number two. Only had enough respect for one. Now, Ruth, I wouldn't and poking her for myself. Of course, you'd have to shoot her afterward. So you wouldn't have to talk to her. - I gotta go. - Think about what I was saying. I'm dying like a man. Everybody gotta go sometime. Even you. - You might as well forget it. You ain't climbing anything with that arm. - Hi Earl! - Earl, come here, Earl. - Hi, Mr. Earl. - Hey dad. - Hey boys. Danny, Ruth Langer is gonna be filling in at the rectory for a couple of weeks, answering phones and stuff for the priests. Ed would like to pay you to look in on Mr. Langer after school, okay? - Do I have to? - Come on son. He's talking about paying you a dollar an hour and all you've been doing is moping around here. - Yeah, but Mr. Langer is weird. - Well, he likes you, and Ed says it was his idea. - Oh bad. - I'd do it for a dollar an hour. Even if he upchucked on me once in a while. - Mr. Langer being weird is not a good enough excuse. If you come up with a better one, let me know. Otherwise you start tomorrow. - Come on in, Danny. Lunch is in the fridge under the wax paper. It's cold chicken and dumplings. He won't eat much though. But if you think he has to go, you just get him on down that hallway to the toilet as fast as you can. Thank God he can still do his private business on his own. I just shut it thick. - Yes ma'am. - Now that'll be me answering the phones for the next two weeks with Julia out on vacation and all. Now, Danny, if you think he's gonna go, I want you to baptize him. - What? - He's never been baptized Catholic. Now there's always a glass of water on the nightstand for that purpose. You just take that glass of water, pour it over his head, and you say, "I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost." Okay? - Well, if you wanna baptize him, why don't you just do it yourself? - Are you kidding? He'd never let us. He hates Catholics. We gotta wait until he's practically dead. Danny, don't let him burn in hell forever. I'm counting on you to save his almighty soul. (indistinct radio chatter) - Is she gone? - Yeah. - Whiskey, three fingers. - It's not there. - What? The Old Crow? They must have hid it. May they rot in freaking hell. Ice box, beer. (radio static) Damn, that feels good. I'll miss cold beers when I die. - Maybe they'll have cold beers in heaven. - You really believe that crap, don't you you little Pope pleaser? Like there's a guy named St. Peter who's really up there with a church key and a couple of million bottles of Schlitz. I'll tell you what heaven is. You walk into a little bar, Pico Trencato, Argentina. Middle of nowhere. It's hot, 'cause it's always hot. You've been dynamiting a jungle mountain and you've got a thirst that makes your palms itch. There are big, slow fans in the ceiling, moving the cool breeze. Your best friend's leaning on on the bar at your elbow. And his tall sweet thing, brown as a nut, eyes shut just open enough, slides are cold San Cristobel towards you, and you crack it. You tip it up. Swallow until your throat freezes over. You can have one if you want. - What? - A beer. I don't give a good god damn. - Oh no, it's okay. I don't drink. - You don't drink. You don't screw. Hell, what kind of a man are you? When I was your age I was banging anything that had a pulse, and whacking whiskey into my face at breakfast. - Around here you were doing that? - No. No, I ran from here. I was about your age, probably younger. See, this was all farm. My old man worked my ass off. One day I just got up and walked out. - So why'd you come back? - Well... (gasping) - What's the matter? - Whiskey. - It's gone, they hid it. - No, there's a battle in the trunk of my car. I just remembered from a dream I was having. - You've got a car? - It broke down around the corner. Go fetch the whiskey. - I don't know. - Come on. If you won't shoot me, you can at least keep me drunk. - Hey, douche bag. - What are you doing with whiskey? - Give me that. Want your head stomped in? - Nah, he's a chicken like his old man. (dramatic music) - Bon soire. - Hey bitch, what do you think you're doing? - Perhaps we don't understand French. Perhaps we'd prefer German. - [Boy] Hey, hey-- - Or Spanish. - Ow! - [Boy] Where did she come from? - It's funny, I would've pegged you as a gin and tonic man. - It's not from me. It's for old man Langer. - Where'd you find it? - In a dream. - What? - Thanks a lot. (man laughing) - Nothing like having a tough broad for her sister. - You should have seen the look on Andy Sweeney's face when she hit him. (man laughing) (coughing) You okay? - Help me, boy. Help me handle this. - Hi there. Pa, this is Father Cronin. He gave me a lift home and I just thought maybe you might wanna talk to him for a while. - Talk about what? - Why, anything you want. - Okay. I got a subject, hookers we have known. (gun firing) (gun firing) - [Man] Dammit Ed, I'm calling the cops this time. (gun firing) (thunder rumbling) - I'm sorry, but there's just absolutely no excuse for discharging a firearm in a residential area. - I still don't understand why the police don't do something. - Oh, Jack McLaskin is dumb like a fox. He only does it on nights that his buddy Don Chance is on patrol. - [Man] That's right. - He and Don served on Iwo Jima. No, Donny won't do anything. (dishes clattering) - I'm sorry. - That's okay, Earl. Earl, what should we do? - I tried talking to him. The petition sure didn't work. - Only one thing to you do. Take his damn gun away. - Good luck. You gonna do it, Ed? - I might, if Earl helps me. - I don't want any trouble. - What trouble? I'm talking about taking it away when he's at work. - Breaking in, that's against the law! - So's murder. (thunder rumbling) - [Wayne] Wow. - I asked you a question. - Kill him. - No, he doesn't want me to do it. He wants to shoot himself. - What's the difference? If you got him the gun, it'd be just like you killing him. - How do you figure that? - I saw it on Perry Mason, accessory before the fact. - What? - Look the guy's in pain. It's the same thing when they put Buddy to sleep. - Buddy was a Cocker Spaniel. - So, pain is pain. - It's hard to watch him cough like that. - Listen, after you shoot him, shoot me, would you? I can't stand baseball practice anymore. - Would you just stop saying that? I'm not gonna shoot anybody. - You're lucky you broke your arm. All you do is shag fly balls until you drop. It's a crummy team, too. You wanna know how crummy it is? I'm the center fielder. That's how crummy it is. (cheerful music) - Hi Father. - Don't bump the whiskey. - Maybe I should get you some shade. - Oh to hell with it. Spent all my life in the sun. If I'm lucky, maybe it'll recognize me, burn me up and blow me away. - I'm just curious, but why does it have to be a gun? - 'Cause it's quick, suits me. Do I look like the kind of guy that would hang himself? - No, sir. - You bet your ass. So where do we get one? - Well, if I left you out here one night, maybe Jack McLaskin will shoot you. (laughing) - No such luck, but he's killed before. I know the type. - How? - Because I killed him man. - Really? In the war? Did you shoot him? - No. I wasn't in the war. Happened in a bar. I hit some big sap with a chair. - But you didn't mean to kill him, did you? - Dead is dead. Dreamt about him every night for 10 years. Then one night he stopped haunting me. I guess he finally forgave me for caving his head in. - Did you go to jail? - Nope, it was in Ecuador. Just left and went to Bolivia. Happens all the time down there. Life is cheap. I'll shut up for a while. The sun feels good. I'm gonna nap in it. (whimsical music) (coughing) What are you staring at? - The tower. It's coming down soon. 'Cause of the new houses. You're never gonna get to climb it. - Why the hell do you want to climb it? - Because I can, I can do it. I'm old enough. I'm strong enough. And I ain't afraid to try. I've been staring at that tower my whole life. I've been climbing trees, houses, anything that was taller than me. And just waiting for the right time. Now. And I go and break my stupid arm. - Hey, hey! Put that down. Go in and make some coffee. (coughing) - Three years ago, some kid from Hamilton tried. He fell about 20 feet from the top. Nobody's ever done it. - You wanna be the big man who does it first. So everyone in the neighborhood will kiss your backside. - You don't understand. That is the highest point in all of Baltimore County. I wanna see from up there, I wanna see something that nobody else ever has. - You got a wagon? (Danny panting) - I gotta rest. - Have a drink in the afternoon if you still got work to do. - Yeah, well I didn't think I'd be dragging you around all day. - Before you do a job, you gotta survey it. Know what I'm talking about? Preparation. 30 years of road and bridgework and virgin jungle, that's what you learn. - Yeah, why do you gotta see the tower? My arm's the problem. - Well then go stick your god damn arm in holy water! I only know about the real world, boy. Go someplace else for miracles. Now giddy up! That's a long way up even with two good arms. I'll help you get up there. You think you get down on your own? - What do you mean, help me get up there? - I'm asking you, boy. Could you get down on your own? - Yeah, I guess. My arm doesn't hurt anymore. I just can't pull myself up real well. What are you thinking? - One step at a time. What I need to know first, can you still use that bow and arrow with a cast on your arm? (water rushing) - Sure is nice to have a man around the house. Here you go. - You're gonna need a plumber. That's all I can do. - God bless a man who knows how to use a wrench. - It looked like somebody whacked that valve with a hammer. - I can't imagine anybody doing that. - Yeah well... - Earl, let's see if your shoes will fit under my bed. - Eileen, that was a... That was a mistake what happened. It was Christmas and all, and us being in the state we were, it was... - Do mistakes always feel that good? - I have to go. - Hey, where'd you get that shirt? Hey! Good men died to earn those stripes! Take it off, you god damn coward! (door slamming) - Wayne, go on home. Your mother needs you. - But my mom said I could eat here tonight. - Well, I'm sorry, I'm saying you can't. - This mean we have to salute you from now on? (slow music) (dog barking) - Danny? Take this on over to Miss Eileen. - Oh boy. (phone clicking) - Ed, hi it's Earl. Anytime you want to go in, okay? Well let's just be damn sure he's not home. - Yeah, I'd say 200 yards of... No, hell wait. Make it 450 yards. - Okay, anything else for that, sir? - Yeah, probably. Hey, give me a couple of spools. - Why are you doing this for me? - I ain't doing nothing else but dying, am I? Why not? Besides, maybe you can help do me a favor. - I never said I'd get you the gun. - No, but you may get so close to heaven up there, you know, see people floating around on clouds, drinking cold beers. You might start feeling real good about me blowing my brains out! (chuckling) (slow music) (arrow swooshing) I'd say a maximum angle of 45 degrees. Kick up true transfection at 43. Minus is the drag coefficient from the twine. Divided by... You want to aim three degrees to the left of the tower. - What's a degree? (arrow swooshing) Great, now what? - Well, hell boy. Try it again. This is gonna be a lot harder than sticking an old man. - How come you weren't in the war? - WW Two. Done government work. Too damn valuable to get killed. - My dad wasn't either, in the war. He had a heart murmur, whatever that is. - You think he ain't a man since he didn't fight. You calling me and your father sissies? - No. - Gonna smack you silly. Trouble with his country. Too many damn people think you gotta charge foreigners with a rifle to be a brave man. (grunting) (coughing) - Last one. - Depends how much you want it. Sometimes you think you want something real bad till you get it. Felt that way about a lot of women, but I don't regret nothing. Better keep your eye on the prize, son. And if you're lucky, you just might find your heart's desire. (slow music) (arrow swooshing) (Danny shouting) Gonna have to climb the last two 10 feet or so on your own. - Well, if you get me that far, there ain't nothing that's gonna stop me. But we've only got two days. Sure we're gonna get it all done on time? - Weight and balance's gonna have to be damn near perfect. How much you weigh? - About 80. - Oh, forget this about. You weigh yourself tonight to the ounce. Damn! Gonna need my old slide rule to figure this. - Where is it? - In the closet where the pistol was supposed to be. Hold it! Parachute harness. Pull, pull, not too fast! Hold it! Okay you're five feet away so take it nice and slow. Easy, easy. Little more, you're almost there. - Okay, you're over the beams. So let it go! - Yes! - We're in. (gentle music) - And how do you know Jack's not home? - He's at the VFW. He'll be drinking for hours. Come on, let's go! M one. No wonder why it was so loud. This thing's a cannon. - So this is the rifle? - Well it's disassembled. I'll have to put it back together. - You know how to do that? - Blindfolded, which is how we learned. This here is the standard issue weapon for all GI's. Should take me about two minutes to put it back together. (metal clanging) Come on! - Gonna need a scale. - I can get one from our bathroom. - Uh huh. - Can I ask you something? - What? - Where are they gonna bury you? - Oh, he's got a plot next to his mother. - You mean your wife? - Ex. - I remember her a little. Miss Mary Ann. She was a nice old lady. (laughing) I never thought of her as an old lady. Always just a girl to me. Pretty girl, just a kid really, when I met her. Came home here to bury my father. Poor little Mary Ann. She had no idea what she was getting into marrying me. - I got a friend, they cremated his father. - I wouldn't give a damn. They ought to burn this sick old body. I think Ed wants me next to Mary Ann so he won't have to make two trips to visit his dead parents. - I'll visit you. - Don't waste your time. You got better things to do than stand over old bones. - I will, though. - Ain't you got any friends? - Yeah. - Got any with muscles? - What? - You got a friend with muscles who owes you? - This is the craziest thing you've ever done. - He says it'll work. - Danny, he's a drunk old man who wears pajamas outside. - You don't know him like I do. Okay, ready, one, two, three. - Come on. Grandma was slow, but she was old. - How many do you need? - I figure four at 65 pounds each. - That's 260 pounds. - Hey! Go to the head of the class. Are you an engineer or something? - Hell no. I worked for a living. Damn engineers called me into those cool as ice trailers. Hand me a page full of numbers, then spend the rest of the day looking for women. Now I was the one, turn those numbers into roads and bridges. Ain't no easy thing, I'm telling you. - But if this don't work, he's gonna die. - It'll work. Now pop that boulder on the scale. - Okay. Oh wait, okay ready? One, two, three. Okay, let's go. And nice and easy, nice and easy. Let go, all right. - How much? - 81. - Start chipping. (boys grunting) (gentle music) - Hold it, right there! Tie it to the beam with a half hitch. What is this world coming to? Two boys who can't tie half hitch? (coughing) - He's gonna die and leave us holding this forever. - Come on, come on. Let me have the slide. Okay, let go. - Neat. - So what's so special about a half width? - Half hitch, Porky. It's strong. It has another neat little feature. comes loose real quick. Here. Pull this. (dramatic music) Fire in the hole! (chuckling) Come on. Since you wanted a demonstration, still got four to get up there. - I would've believed you. He didn't have to show me. (engine rattling) - Hey buddy. - Hey. - Now go inside and help your sister with dinner, okay? - Dad, I'm beat. I need to rest a minute. - Just get inside and help your sister with dinner please. (cat squawking) (gentle radio music) - [Danny] Psst. Mr. Langer. - Hey. What do you want? - You're crying. - So? I'm dying. Got a right to. - What happened? - Nothing, just old song. Old song is supposed to make you cry. What's up? - I'm scared. (coughing) - Join the club. - No, I mean, I'm never scared about climbing myself, but tomorrow night I'm not gonna be doing it with my own two hands and feet. It's just, it's kind of scary. - So what do you want, a written guarantee? There ain't none in life, boy. Hey, hey I couldn't let anything happen to you. You my ticket to the hereafter. Whatever the hell that is. - Come on. I never said I'd get you the gun. - No, not in so many words. I can say one thing for sure. You are gonna have one hell of a ride. - You think so? (chuckling) - I'd skip supper. - Any action? - Ed, don't scare me like that. - He's gotta know it's gone by now, right? - Ed, there were two things in that house. A bed and a gun. Now he knows it's gone. - Maybe he'll just drop the whole thing. - Maybe, maybe not. I don't know, I think there's something wrong with Jack. Something real wrong. - I'll be in the house if you need me. - [Eileen] Yoohoo, Earl. - [Earl] Eileen, what are you doing here? - Here's hot. - Do you know what time it is? - [Eileen] 11. - Okay, you should not be here. This is when he usually starts. - What are you trying to prove here? - No, I mean it. He could start shooting any minute. It's not safe. - Oh, you've got his gun, so why are you holding a vigil? - Eileen, I think he's a very sick man. - Then why are you sticking your ass out? Pardon my French. I don't see any of this neighborhood's brave vets sitting out here. - 'Cause I think I can help him. Oh damn, there it is. (door slamming) (engine revving) (tires screeching) - What is it with you and floors? - You should go home. - Moves like that. You should go into wrestling. - Hey Danny. Have you seen the-- scale. Danny! - You said you'd help. We've only got one more to get up there. - But I promised my mom two days ago. I just forgot. Come on, she can't fertilize the whole lawn by herself. I'm the man of the house now. I gotta help her. - If he wants to fool around with women and horse manure, let him. We'll finish up ourselves. - I'll be there tonight, I swear. - [Langer] Come on. (coughing) - I don't think this is such a good idea. - Shut up, pull. Now hold it. Take a look. - You gonna be okay? - You do it. (coughing) - It's okay. Tie it off. - All right. (grunting) Whiskey. (coughing) (coughing) Give me the harness. - Wait, rest a minute. - Come on, we're almost done. (coughing) A man works, a man sweats, a man dies. And he's forgotten almost as quick as the sweat dries. - Is that a poem? - No, it's an old working man's toast. The last time I heard it I wasn't dying. - Yeah, but all those roads and bridges you built. They'll always be there. - You're right, Danny. You're right. Go on, hide this in the shed. Nobody will see it. (coughing) - Mr. Langer, Mr. Langer! (dramatic music) I better call Miss Ruth. - No, forget her. I don't want her voice to be the last one I ever hear. (panting) And if you go for that god damn water and try and baptize me I'll strangle you with my last breath. (groaning) I don't believe I can take too many more of those. (groaning) - Oh my, Father Cronin! What are you doing, I told you to stop it! - This is not what it seems. - Oh my God, Danny, no! No, he was just looking. - Bless me Father for I have sinned. It's been a week since my last confession. (slow music) - Go climb stuff. - Did you give him that gun? He is gonna shoot himself. - That's the idea. - Don't you get smart with me. Who do you think you are, God? You have no right to help him burn in hell forever. Papa, you give me that gun right now! There will be no suicides in my family. (indistinct mumbling) (gun firing) (shouting) - I still think we should call the police. - What kind of priest are you anyway? You're trained to talk people down off buildings. We don't need the police. - Whoa, he's got a loaded gun in there! - And we've got a loaded gun out here. Now let's try this again. You go talk to Papa, and Danny and I are gonna go have a little chat over some ice water. Aren't we, Danny? (indistinct shouting) (loud popping) Father Cronin! - [Cronin] I'm okay. - Now Danny, I think you know how wrong it was to give Papa Langer that gun. And I think you know that if he shoots himself you are going to have a mortal sin on your soul. - [Danny] He suffered enough. - It is not your place to decide that. It is up to the almighty God to decide how much we should hurt. - Did God decide for you to show your boobs to Father Cronin? - Young man, you are in big trouble with your family and the church. Talk like that will only get you in deeper. But, I am glad that you asked about what you saw upstairs. There's a very simple reason why I revealed myself to him. He has taken a vow of celibacy. Father Cronin has never seen the breasts of a full grown woman. And he was very curious, and I was merely showing him that which he has never seen. And there is no sin in that. - Great. So maybe you wouldn't mind coming and showing them babies to my entire sixth grade class. - Danny, please, don't tell Ed! Oh, Eddie, it's terrible. - What's wrong? Hey Father Cronin, what are you doing here? - It's Papa. Danny went and got him your gun from upstairs and Papa's gonna kill himself. - You got him my gun? How did you know where it was? - Eddie, it's just awful. We've been sitting out here for hours. So I called father Cronin and he came right over to try to talk him out of it. Eddie, Papa took a shot at me. - Father, I appreciate you coming over. I know you're a very busy man. Thank... Wait, he took a shot at you? - Yes, honey. The bullet went right by my ear and stuck in the wall. - Well, hell I mean, excuse me, Father. I only keep one bullet in that gun. - Thanks anyway, boy, What kind of idiot keeps one bullet in a six shooter? - I won't have a gun in this house. And here you are sneaking around other people's closets stealing them! - He asked me to get it! I mean, he's not afraid. He wants to end it. - Daniel, it is not your place to help him. - Why not? I mean, it's not like you know anything more about death than I do. You weren't in the war. - Go to your room right now! - No, I have to get out tonight. - This is not like forgetting to take out the trash, young man. You have just given somebody a gun to kill himself. If Ed here pressed charges, your young ass could spend time in a reform school. Go to your room. (thunder rumbling) (slow music) - Leslie. - [Leslie] Dammit! You know, blackmail is punishable by death in some countries. - Come on, faster. - You weigh more than I remember. I don't even know if hold you. - You can do it. Put your feet against the wall. - They are. - Good, keep going. - I can't. You grew up Danny. You're too damn heavy. - All right, let go. - Are you bleeding? - Thanks a lot. I really mean it. - Send up Troy Donahue and we'll be even. - [Danny] You're the best sister in the world! (gentle music) (indistinct chatter) (indistinct shouting) - [Wayne] Danny! - Get the harness! - [Wayne] Where the hell have you been? - Help me, Andy. - [Boy] Himes is here. Keep going, Andy! - Wind's picking up. - [Boy] I'm right behind you. - Let's go! - Danny, it's too windy. - Come on! - Looks like a parachute. - [Boy] That kid's nuts. - One, two, three! (dramatic music) - [Boy] It's like Superman! - Wow! - Look! (Danny shouting) - [Girl] What happened? - [Boy] Why doesn't he go to the top? - Tommy? - Yeah? - Get help. I'm coming down. - [Boy] Hang on Danny, I'm coming. - Look at that. - [Danny] Oh no. (Danny panting) (lightening crackling) (rain splattering) - I'm getting wet. I gotta go home. - Me too. - He's stuck! You better get somebody to help! - [Boy] I can't go any higher, I'm coming down. - Where is he? Danny? (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) (lightening crashing) - [Earl] Danny! Danny! - Dad! - Danny, hold on son. I'll be right there. - I can't get a grip. It's too windy. (Danny whimpering) Dad! - It's all right son, hold on! - Dad! - Come on. It's okay Danny, I'm coming. Danny. How many pounds do you have on the end of those ropes? - 260. - All right, this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna jump on and grab onto you. And then we're gonna ride it down, all right? - Yeah. (grunting) - All right. Okay pal. Ready, look at me, look right at me! All right son. One, two, three! Hold on Danny. - [Danny] I ain't going anyplace. - Danny! The knife, in my pocket. You got it? - Oh no! (screaming) - Oh no! - Danny, when we hit, don't let go. - [Boy] Yeah, that was like so cool! - [Earl] Oh my God! - [Boy] Watch out! (dramatic music) (siren blaring) - [Boy] Hey look, there's Wayne. (horn honking) (gentle radio music) - Psst. - What happened. - I didn't make it to the top. - You tried, during a thunderstorm? - Yeah, got stuck up there. But I was so close. - It's all right. You can only go as far as your own sleeve lengths. That's all you can do. At least you tried. - Yeah. My dad had to come up and get me. - Oops. - Yep, he is not too happy. - I reckon he's pissed at me too. One good thing about dying, I don't give a damn. He was a brave man to climb up there, save your silly ass. - Yeah, I know. - So you learn something every day. How was the ride? - Unbelievable. (chuckling) Ah, there ain't nothing like it in any amusement park. (laughing) - Well maybe I should patent it. Sell it to crazy 12 year olds. (laughing) (gun firing) (gun firing) (indistinct mumbling) - I didn't have a hard murmur, Jack. I had a breakdown when I was 17, but when the war broke out the Army wouldn't take me. I wanted to go like everybody else, but they don't take head cases. I know what you're going through. I do. Who are you pissed at, Jack? Come on, who are you shooting at? - God. - Who? - Because of the way he let them die. They were just kids playing war in the jungle. Crying for their mommies. Spilling their guts. Dying in your arms. Can't forgive. Can't forget. - You got any coffee in the house? - Beer. Why? - Why don't you give me one and tell me what it was like. (slow music) - Earl, you okay? - Would you like to go to a drive-in movie tonight? - What's playing? - Who gives a damn. (somber music) Danny? Hey Danny. Mr. Langer passed away last night. (somber music) - Dad, I don't wanna go to the funeral. I'll just visit the grave later. - Okay. You know, Danny, your mother once told me something. Something I think about every day of my life. She said, "A really brave person doesn't ever have to prove it anybody." Well, right there would be a pretty good place for a house. - You'd have a great view. (slow music)
