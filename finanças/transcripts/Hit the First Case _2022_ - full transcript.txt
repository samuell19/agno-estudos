Sushmi! Sushmi! Vikram! Over here, Vikram! Vikram! Over here, Vikram! Please help me out, Vikram! I am over here. -Vikram! -Sushmi! -Sushmi! Let go of her! -Get me out of here, Vikram! -Leave her right now! -Vikram! -Sushmi! -Please get me out of here. -Untie her! Let her go! -Vikram! No! -Sushmi! -Vikram! -Sushmi! -Please get me out of here, Vikram. -Open the gate! -Please don't do this to me! -Sushmi! -Please get me out of here. Let me go. Please, Vikram. Please get me out of here. -Open up! Let her go. -Please don't do this to me. Please… -Sushmi! -Vikram! -Vikram! -Unlock the gate! Let her go! No… No! -No! -Vikram! Please… No! I'm advising you as a friend, not as a doctor. You need to quit this job. It's because you can't treat me, right? Both, the advice and the treatment will do you good. I cannot quit the department. Why don't you understand, Vikram? You're a classic case of post-traumatic stress. Your vitals are being affected. Your blood pressure has gone through the roof. -If this isn't treated urgently-- -It'll give me a stroke, right? I know. Prescribe me some Valium, and let me go back to work. You must be the only patient in the world to tell a doctor what medicine has to prescribed. I thought I was talking to a friend. That's why I am trying to reason with you. Your current job scenario keeps triggering memories from your past. And that's why you get these panic attacks. If you can't quit the force, get yourself transferred to a desk job. Vikram… I hope this stays confidential. RAJASTHAN POLICE Scrutinize that area as well. Hey, Vikram. Sir, good morning. Ask him to shut the machine down. Hello! Hey, stop that! We have information that the dead body is somewhere here. Has Akshay still not been able to find it? We don't need you here. -Leave. -I only take orders from Shekhawat sir. Mr. Shekhawat? Sir. Yes, sir, but… I know, sir. But I can handle this. Call for some tea. We've been looking around for the past six hours, sir. Even our sniffer dogs are tired now. Thank God you're here! It's this way, sir. Why is he picking wild shrubs? -He's just putting up an act. -Sir. He should have been a theater actor. He doesn't shave. Moreover, he dresses shabbily. Does he even look like a policeman? Perhaps that is what he wants. I mean to say… the people from your department keep meeting in disguise. Take a good look at these wild shrubs. These are of three different types. Do you guys see it? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. I want you guys to spread out. Inform me if you see these three wild shrubs growing together at one place. You heard the man. Spread around! Excuse me, Shiv. Sir, here's your tea. What is your name? Sheru. Do you go to school? Tell me the truth or I will put you behind bars. Do you go to school? Ask your boss to meet me. Go. Sir! -Dig right here. -Okay, sir. Hey! -Go easy. -Okay. Who is here from the forensics? Sir. Are you okay? Vikram… how did you know where the body was? Do you know why farmers remove wild shrubs from the fields? No. These wild shrubs release certain bio-chemicals into the soil, so that no other plants grow in their vicinity. So? If we dig a place where these wild shrubs grow, the bio-chemicals in the soil get disturbed. This facilitates other wild shrubs to grow together at that place. So three different wild shrubs won't grow together until someone digs the ground. Try and depixelate the picture a little more. The police wants a clean image. Give it your best shot. She throws orders like she's the boss. Excuse me? Did you say something? No, ma'am. Go home if you have a problem taking orders from a woman. We don't just need men here. We need men who can work. Sorry, ma'am. How's your mom doing? Her condition is getting worse. The cardiologist has advised to shift her to AIIMS, Delhi. That's good. Your brother stays there, right? Yes, I have to take Mom there, but it doesn't seem possible now. Don't stress over it. -And don't hesitate to ask for help. -Thanks. How is Sapna? Doing good? She is fine. She keeps checking up on you. You should come over someday. You haven't seen the new house yet. Sure. Soon. What's the status on DNA validation? We've validated a technique which can match DNA results in two hours. That's still long. We need to validate a technique to match the DNA in an hour. -We are trying. -Okay, keep me posted. Sure. Sir, how are you? Running late. My wife is waiting. Is Neha making you wait as usual? No, she'll be here soon. -Sorry. Come, let's go. -Let's go. Mr. Saxena, why don't you also join us for coffee? My wife will never make me tea again if I join you for coffee today. -Bye. -Bye. -Let's go. -See you guys. I too should get going. You guys carry on. Why? Is your wife waiting for you? Let him go, Vikram. They are a newlywed couple. Let them enjoy. -Bye, Rohit. -Bye. -See you. -See you. Don't you like my company that you were asking him to be the third wheel? Hey, he's a friend. You too asked Mr. Saxena to join us for coffee. But I know he prefers tea. Do you like this place? It's nice. The view is good. And so is my company. Once a student asked his teacher, what is more important… the journey or the destination. Do you know what the teacher said? The company. That means I should be content with your company. Right? And that I shouldn't wait for a destination, right? -I'm not-- -Two minutes, please. We have what matters the most. Trust is what matters the most. And you don't trust me. Why would you say that? You haven't told me anything about your past yet. See… Neha, I am a very simple man. I cannot lie to you and I don't have the courage to tell you the truth. I really don't know when I'll be able to open up. But if I ever open up… it'll be only to you. That's okay. Take your time. I am not forcing you. Tell me whenever you're ready. I am ready to order. Sometimes there will be a smile And sometimes the eyes will be moist The more the sorrows are The more happier the days will be We will go through everything together Without any regret With you by my side Every phase of life will be beautiful Life will be beautiful My heart has attained solace And rues are now at ease Ever since you've stepped into my life And become a part of it To my lonely nights And my lifeless eyes You've shown some dreams Once again There will be a smile on my lips Everything will shine bright This world will be as beautiful As the sky With you by my side Every phase of life will be beautiful Life will be beautiful He doesn't listen to me, Neha. He might listen to you. All that stress is affecting his heart. My serious professional advice is that he needs to quit his job. If he doesn't quit, I'll be forced to certify him as unfit. Please talk to him. Neha, please understand. My work is what is keeping me sane. I'll lose my mind if I quit. Why won't you take the doctor's advice seriously? Do you want me to lose my sanity? You're blowing this out of proportion. Please just relax. Vikram, I would do the same if it was Rohit in your place. Let's take a second opinion. I don't want any opinion. I won't quit the force. End of story. You'll be fired if you don't quit. What do you mean I'll be fired? Ritika will certify you as unfit. So you guys are here to blackmail me. You guys are fucking blackmailing me now! She doesn't want to do that. We just care for you! That's all! Yeah. Vicky, please sit. Look at me. Look at me. Can you at least take a few weeks off? Let's go away for a while. Let's visit your hometown. Please allow yourself to heal. You can get back after that. That's the least you can do. Please say something, Vicky. Say something, I'm trying to help you. And you never share anything with me. You neither express yourself nor do you listen to me. I don't understand what's the point of us being to… Fine. If you want me to leave… I will! But nothing's going to change. Vikram! Listen! Leave me alone, Rohit, please. Jai hind,sir. Good morning, sir. Jai hind, sir. Vishnu! Stop watching videos and focus on your job. Three months? Do you really want to exhaust all your leaves at one go? I don't have a choice, sir. How will the department run in the absence of its officer in charge? Rohit will take charge. Why all of a sudden? Personal reasons, sir. I don't remember the last time you took a leave. You deserve the break. Thank you, sir. I am granting you this leave because you've mentioned that you will be available over the phone. -Yes, 24-7. -Good. You may go. -Thank you, sir. -And take care. Excuse me, sir. Hello? How many times do I have to ask you to not call me? Look, I am not interested in talking to you. Where are you going? Preeti! Where did she go? Let her be independent. You cannot keep her on a short leash forever. Once she is back, she's had it. JAGATPURA Hey, Siri… Hey, Siri! Crap! DAULATNAGAR EXIT DAULATNAGAR DAULATNAGAR DAULATNAGAR ENTRY Oh, no! Is this happening for real? Please! No! Shit! Any problem, madam? My car broke down. Yeah? Damn! -It's scorching hot. -Sorry? Madam, did you call the company helpline? I couldn't. I forgot my phone back home. I was going back to get it, but the car broke down. Looks like you are having a bad day. Where do you stay? I stay nearby, in Jagatpura. Come with me. I'll drop you. You can have the car towed later. No. Sorry, sir. My mom will go ballistic if she sees me in a police jeep. Moreover, you don't have a lady constable accompanying you. May I use your phone to call my dad though? Hello, Dad? I'm calling from a police inspector's phone. Actually, my car broke down and he was just passing by. I forgot my phone at home. Dad, can you just come and pick me up? Not on the road to Jaipur. I'm on the road towards our home. Okay. Bye. Dad will be here. I'll get going then. Sure. Thank you. JAGATPURA POLICE STATION RAJASTHAN Mr. Sharma, here's the file sir asked for. Stop. The world is going to the dogs. People don't trust the police anymore. -A girl-- -Come on, Ibrahim! This is Mr. Maangi Lal's file. So? What's wrong? Sir had asked for Mr. Maangi Chand's file. What the hell! Ask sir to wait. I'll be back in 15 minutes. JAGATPURA ENTRY DAULATNAGAR EXIT DAULATNAGAR POLICE STATION JAIPUR RURAL -Laaduram! -Yes, sir? You need to get your eyes checked. Why, sir? My eyesight is fine. You really think so?! Which file did you hand over to me? I'll get the right one, sir. -Laaduram! -Here you go, sir. You'll cost me my job someday. Sir… DAULATNAGAR ENTRY POLICE Is something wrong? I am looking for my daughter. She was supposed to meet me here. Yes, she called from my phone. Where is she? On my way back, I saw her talking to someone in a blue car. I thought it must be you. Blue car? No, that wasn't me. It wasn't you? Then it must be a friend of hers. She must have reached home by now. Lakshmi, did Preeti get back home? No? No, it's nothing. Sir, she's not home yet. She must have gone out with her friends. You should go home. You can call me if she does not return by evening. I'm Ibrahim, SI at Daulatnagar Police Station. Preeti isn't home yet. IBRAHIM SHAIKH POLICE SUB-INSPECTOR Why didn't you call me yesterday? I had asked you to, right? Why didn't you wait till I got there? Excuse me, sir! Please watch your tone. I had offered to drop her home. -You weren't doing her a favor. -You're right. I was wrong. I shouldn't have offered help. I should have just checked the papers of the vehicle and left. You have made a mistake. Now go and find her! Hey, don't you dare throw orders at me! I'm not your servant. Well, you are a public servant! Her safety is your responsibility. Keep quiet or someone else will have to burden your responsibility for life! Sir, please. Go register a missing complaint. We'll see what needs to be done. Is the car still lying there or did you bring it back home? We were looking for Preeti all night. The car was the last thing on our mind. Laaduram. Ma'am. Please hold the traffic. I need to ask you a few questions. -What is your name? -Veena. Veena, how many CCTV cameras does this tollgate have? Two, sir. One towards the road, and the other towards the tollgate. I need to see yesterday's footage, from 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. From both the cameras. There is no blue car that can be seen passing between 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., sir. I saw 20 blue cars on the road in the last 15 minutes, and you couldn't even find one blue car in that two-hour time frame? You can check it for yourself, sir. Where did that car disappear? I saw her talking to someone in a blue car. One cannot turn the car around and drive for long. -Do one thing. -Yes, sir. Get me the CCTV footage from all the four tollgates before Jagatpura. We will see if there is any blue car entering the highway. I have received a complaint against you, Ibrahim. It is not my fault, sir. Apologize to Mr. Mohan immediately. -I am sorry, sir. -Not me, Ibrahim. Apologize to him. I cannot do that, sir. Where is your weapon? Laaduram? You are suspended for insubordination. You were the last person to talk to the missing person. Your actions will be investigated. And you know what will happen if you don't cooperate. Now get out. If you want to get out of the city… you can inform Laaduram. I'm sorry, Mohan. I wish things would have turned out differently. Just find Preeti, Ajit. Don't worry. I'll look into this personally. And I will also deploy my best officer. Mr. Saxena, how are you? Vikram, Neha is nowhere to be found. She has gone missing. Missing? Since when? Sir, please give me all the details of Neha's case. Sit down. I'm fine, sir. Neha's profile has already been sent to the mobile units. Let's not waste time, sir. Just give me the details. Vikram… this case is being handled by someone else. Who? May I come in, sir? -Sir, transfer this case to me. -No chance. You are on the suspect list. I spoke to Rohit regarding this. Right before he left for his vacation… he had a fight with Neha. He told you that? Yes. Neha's call records prove the same. She called him a number of times… but he didn't take her calls. Because I was mad. He was mad at her, sir. He takes a sabbatical, and there she goes missing. Neha's mother doesn't like him either. Why does everyone have a problem with you? Sir, we need to interrogate him. Are you drunk? You're talking to a police officer. Then talk like a police officer. Don't forget that you are working because I had taken a sabbatical. Sir, are you handing over this case to me or not? If you try to get yourself involved in my case, I swear I will-- Hey! Sorry, sir. Sir, I should have been the first person to know this. You cannot handle your girlfriend's case without getting emotional. Don't you know me, sir? Enough. I am not saying you did it, but the investigating officer is suspecting you. You have to cooperate. How will that idiot find Neha when he cannot even find himself in a mirror? -Vikram! -We're wasting our time. Vikram! This conversation is over. Okay, sir. You can do what you feel is right. I'll do what I feel is right. Are you sure Neha's last known location is her home? That's what Akshay's report states. I need to go into Neha's house, Rohit. Are you sure? If Akshay finds out, he will zero in on you for sure. My statement has already put you in a tight spot. The only thing I care about right now is Neha and not him. So boys, did anyone come here? -All good? -Yes, sir. All good. Not much activity here, sir. -We've been here for a couple of nights. -Give me the keys. Give me the keys. What happened? Is everything alright? Yes, sir. There seems to be some loose connection. Something's definitely happened in the house. She came home from office just like any other day. She parked her car as usual. There is no sign of forcible entry. All the doors and windows are intact. But Neha has disappeared. And I could smell a strong attar in the house. Attar? But that could be from any of the constables or police officers. Get me the data of Neha's call records and messages. It'll take some time. I have to do it discreetly… or Akshay will find out. I should have talked to her. She called me so many times. She might have called to seek help. -We are trying our best. -Vikram, Neha's mom. Auntie. Auntie, I know you don't like me, but I promise I will find Neha. Auntie? Come. As per your request, here are the records of all the cases Neha dealt with in the last three months. Make sure these records are not disclosed. Rohit. Preeti Mathur went missing on August 13th. An eighteen-year-old who went missing from a highway two months ago. So? Neha and Preeti, both go missing. The same gender and the same city. Neha was handling Preeti's case. Too much of a coincidence. But Neha went missing from her house, whereas Preeti went missing from the highway. The MO isn't the same either. Look at the footnote. All the other cases that Neha handled were also studied by her assistants, but this was the only case she was studying herself. Let's find out who is handling Preeti's case. Inspector Saini is handling this case. When was the last time you spoke to Neha? We spoke over the call a couple of days ago. What did she say? I wanted a forensic update on Preeti's case. She told me she had a breakthrough, and that she'd meet me after she confirms it. I'd like to see all the evidence collected in Preeti's case. There isn't much. Give me a minute. This piece of cotton was found in Preeti's car. And an injection needle was found on the roadside. But it's contaminated. I have gone through all her call records as well. They're totally clean. Sir. Sir, please hand over Preeti's case to me. -Why? -I'm following a hunch. Please, trust me. But I've already assigned this case to Saini. I will talk to him. Alright, Vikram. Just find the girl. -Preeti's dad is a close friend of mine. -Sure, sir. The same guy who kidnapped Preeti had been to Neha's house as well. I smelled exactly the same attar in the car as well as the house. Where do we start? -I want Preeti's case files… -Yes. the tollgate CCTV footage of the entry and exit points, forensics files and everything related to this case. Okay. Also find out if Neha had updated anybody about Preeti's case. Okay. And Rohit… get the court's permissions to obtain DNA samples from Preeti's family and friends. Okay. I'm guessing you haven't had dinner yet. Vikram… You did the right thing by not apologizing. Being a public servant doesn't make you're his slave. What kind of a friend are you? A true friend would have advised me to apologize to the girl's father, and get back to the case. The issue is not whether I am right or not, the issue here is that the girl is still missing. You are right, Ibrahim. But it's too late now. Who are you? He's taken over Preeti's case. Sit. -It's okay, sir. -Sit down. Get going. He'll see you guys in the evening. Let's go to your place? I need to ask you a few questions. -Sure, sir. -Finish your tea first. Sir, my scooter is at the mechanic shop for a repair. Can I pick it up? -Fahad… -Yes? -is my scooter repaired? -Yes, sir. -Can I take it? -Yes, you can. Then they had me suspended. I was doing my duty diligently, sir. Trust me. See, Ibrahim, I need you to give me proper details. Are you sure you didn't miss out on anything? No, sir. I have provided every little detail. Can I look around your house? Look, I trust everything that you've said. Now, you too need to trust me on this. -Let me show you around. -Please, sit. I don't think I will trouble you anymore, but you have to be there when I need you. Anytime, sir. Keep an eye on him. Did you find anything suspicious? We have spoken to every driver who has passed that area, but no one has seen the blue color car except him. Even the CCTV footage didn't show any such car. Manjit, this contains his fingerprints. Collect them carefully. Okay, sir. Collect the cigarette bud as well, for his DNA sample. What's happening? Is there any update on Neha's case? Neha's boyfriend is suspected all the more. Because he secretly entered into the investigating officer's cabin and is caught checking evidences. I don't want to fight. Let's find Neha together. Get out! Is there any other route to the highway from Preeti's house? No. A lot of trucks pass through this route. Ask the drivers if anybody had noticed anything. Okay. It's been two months since the investigation started. Officers have visited us even in the past. We've cooperated with them as well. The case is transferred from officer to officer but the result is zero. Do you even care of her whereabouts? What is your department up to? As per her bank statement a fixed amount was transferred to the Saraswati orphanage every month. Do you have any idea about it? Yes. After her parent's died, her account-- Wait a second. So, you guys aren't her real parents? Preeti is an orphan. My husband's elder brother-in-law and sister-in-law had adopted her and took her to America along with them. But both of them died in a plane crash. Later, we brought her back to India. And now we are her guardians. SARASWATI ORPHANAGE She has been through a rough childhood. But despite that she's always been a happy and lovable child. Mohan and Lakshmi loved her a lot. I believe the adoption process was done through you. Yes. Preeti is a kindhearted girl, sir. I wonder why all of this happens with her. I wonder why bad things happen to good people. Please find her as quickly as possible. Why did she send a fixed amount to the orphanage every month? My brother used to donate an amount every month to support the orphanage. After his death, we took up that responsibility. And Preeti has taken up that responsibility since she's turned 18. What did you do of the amount Preeti donated every month? Her donation would provide education and food to at least ten kids. Is anybody here who knows Preeti? No. How was her relation with her neighbors? Everybody lives in their own world in the colony. She was still good friends with Sheela. How was your equation with Preeti? We are good friends, sir. We like spending time with each other. She comes here often. When was the last time you spoke to her? On the 12th of August. I guess. -A day before Preeti went missing. -Yes, sir. Actually, she was here to invite me for a party at Chemistry. But I had severe headache, so I couldn't go. Where were you on 13th August? I was out visiting my daughter. We spent half of our day together in a park then I dropped her home and returned. Doesn't your daughter stay with you? No, sir. She lives with her father. We are divorced. Everyone in the society avoids me but Preeti never judged me. She is a good girl, sir. Can I talk to your husband? -You mean my ex-husband. -Yes, ex-husband. -Can I call him? -Of course sir, but… Don't worry, ma'am. It's a routine call. We are just verifying statements of Preeti's friends and relatives' . Right, sir. Tell me one thing. The property that your brother and sister-in-law owned in America… Yes? -It belonged to them, right? -Yes. What happened to that? It's registered under Preeti's name. Has it always been registered under Preeti's name? We used to be the trustees. But after Preeti turned 18, the property was transferred to her. -Rohit! -Preeti's parents, right? I've added them in the suspect list. Bring back Preeti! -We want justice. -We want justice. Bring back Preeti! -We want justice. -We want justice. Bring back Preeti! -We want justice. -We want justice. How close are Preeti and you? She is my best friend, sir. Sir, I'm Ekta. Preeti is my best friend. -Ekta Chauhan? -Yes, sir. I was anyway going to call you. When did you last speak to her? On 12th August. All of us were at Chemistry that day. As per our call records, you were the last person to talk to Preeti. Sir, we were supposed to catch up that day and hence I called her up to confirm the time. But she seemed drowsy on the call so I couldn't speak to her. You mean she was unable to speak? No, she was sleepy. She woke up late that morning. -Does she drink? -No, sir. Are Ajay and Preeti dating? No, sir. They are just friends. Where were you on the 13th? Sambhar. At my grandma's place. It's just a one and a half hour drive from Jaipur. I know that. Should I call and confirm the same with your grandma? Yes, you can. Do any of you guys own a blue colored sedan car? No, sir. I don't think so. I need a proper answer. Nobody owns a blue sedan. Did anyone have any grudges against Preeti? Preeti is a really sweet person. She was friends with everyone around here. But, there has been a tiff going on between Professor Chandra Shekhar and Preeti. I couldn't let a bright student ruin her career in my presence. What was she into? Look at the kind of clothes she wears. Short skirts, tight jeans, crop tops. She exposes her waist. A girl's waist is exposed even in a sari. Have you seen the kind of people she's with these days? She keeps hanging around with Ajay who's always high. He smokes cigarette, weed and he drinks as well. What is it that you don't like about Preeti? This is damn serious. Girls like her are the reason our culture is getting ruined. When did you last talk to Preeti? -I do not remember. -So, recall it. I said I don't remember. How do you travel to college? -Why? -You need to answer me. How do you travel to college? -On a bike. -Don't you have car? -Why? -Hey! Note down every single thing! And ask him if you don't understand. He will answer. I can't drive. Sorry? I can't drive! Okay. That's Manjeet. He will be collecting some fluids and hair samples. Please cooperate. What samples? Do you have court orders to procure the same? This is for the DNA sample, right? On what basis are you here to collect these samples? I know what my rights are as a citizen. Go, get the permission. -Don't you take classes these days? -Why? Talking to you made me feel so. What? It seems you've lots of spare time. What do you think? I doubt Ibrahim, Ajay and Chandrashekhar? You can avoid Chandrashekhar. But he was the one resisting to give us samples. He was just threatening us. We have two types of police, Rohit. I'm assuming one of them is us. We stop people from committing crimes. What about the other? Moral police. They stop people from doing things, that they couldn't do in their life. Don't let Ekta and Ajay out of your sight. Why is she sitting there crying? She's nervous because she's going to be adopted today. Thank you, Uncle. Please, find her. I will. We are not supposed to get emotionally attached to our cases. I am worried for you. You took over the case for Neha, but now I feel you're getting yourself attached to Preeti's case. Please don't let that happen. -Manjeet. -Sir. The chain of custody is in Rohit's dairy. -Collect it from him. -Yes, sir. I shall leave. My car is here. Book a table for dinner tonight. At the Chemistry night club. Get Sapna along, so that we can blend easily with the crowd. Okay. I will see you there. Shall I ask you something? Do you remember our first kiss? Is this an interrogation? Please tell me. The first time… do you remember? Yes, I also remember what you were wearing. Look, I might not remember the date and the time -but-- -I knew it. But I very well remember what I felt. That's important. Date and time do not matter. Oh shit! What is it? Vikram! Switch off the mainline quickly. Go. And bring a piece of cloth. Do you hear me, Vikram? -Hi! -Hey! -Hey! -Hi! -Thanks for coming. -How are you doing? Observe everybody carefully. Customers, manager, bartenders, each and everybody present here. Okay. Note down every little thing that you find suspicious. Okay. I would need the CCTV footage of 12th from every camera. Will do. Do you remember the Kishangarh kidnapping case? Yes, the twin brothers were kidnapped, right? Bartender, 9 o'clock. If he grows some beard and hair, he will look like that kidnapper. Quite possible. -Hello! -Yeah, sir. Come. Yes, sir. -Bunty? -Yeah, sir. Do you know a place where youngsters can have fun? I'm new to the city and looking for some fun. You get it, right? Yes, I do. You could go to the housing colony. I could guarantee you satisfaction. Really? I came from Kishangarh last night. Have you ever been there? Criminals can never escape from the police. Now quickly answer my question or else I will use third degree in jail. On 12th night… Shall I shoot? No. Boss! Who are you? Hey! Where are they? Tell me! -In my pocket. -What? I have cocaine and heroine. Did you run for this? -Have you seen her? -No. Look at her closely. Or else I will thrash you again. Have you seen her? I have seen her a couple of times in the club. -With Ajay. -And? I don't know anything else, sir. Hawa Singh, we accidentally busted a drug dealer in the old city. We are behind the clock tower. Get here and arrest him. It happened by accident. If you are not interested, I'll let him go. Stay down! Okay. You guys should arrange a puja at your place. A puja? What for? For Preeti's safety. Why don't you accept that you've given up on this case? It's a part of my investigation, sir. And it has to happen tomorrow itself. Ask every relative and all of Preeti's friends to attend the puja. And make sure you handover the list of all the guests. What are you trying to do, sir? Trust me, sir. Vikram, what kind of investigation is this? Tell me? What do you think, Rohit? Will the kidnapper attend the puja if invited? -I don't think so. -That is what I want. Make a list of all the people who do not attend this event. What if the kidnapper does attend? That'll be great. If the kidnapper attends this, I am sure he will leave a clue behind for me to trace. Along with us, the best profiles of the department will attend this puja. They will keep a close watch on every guest that comes in. In cases like these, culprits are usually in the family circle. The puja ceremony is a good opportunity for us to observe our current suspects and also find new suspects. Got it. What about the CCT-- What about Neha's call records? They'll come in by tomorrow evening. And the CCTV footage of the Chemistry club? The forensics have it. They'll analyze it by tomorrow. Hurry up, Rohit. I am trying. Mr. Mohan! Mr. Mohan! -Could you please come along? -What's wrong? -Please come along! -What happened? Sir, it's very urgent. Please come with me once. Please, sir. This way, sir. Sir… Sir… I was on my way to attend the puja… -What's the matter? -What's the note for? Don't be scared. -Lakshmi, keep quiet. Let her speak. -When I came out… No, it can't be Preeti. I don't know, sir… They have mentioned a dead body. What are you doing out here? Let me hold him. Did you have your breakfast? Shall we? I saw them again. I saw them after you left this morning. They were standing out there. They were keeping an eye on me. Ramesh. Yes, sir? Did you see anyone around after I had left? No, sir. -You sure? -Yes, sir. Okay. Sushmi. Here, have your medicines. Why don't you get it? These tablets are the real problem. Sushmi, the doctor has prescribed this medicine. No! Where are you going? I want to interrogate you. Are you out of your mind? Neha is my girlfriend. Why would I harm her? You could explain that better. Fucking moron! Hey! Bloody idiots! You're none less than hooligans on the street. -Sir, this guy-- -Enough, Akshay! You can leave. Vikram… Rohit is leading a search party behind Raja godown. You should go. This isn't fair, sir. Don't say a word, Akshay. You're obsessed with Vikram. If you really focused on the case, you'd have been searching the dead body now instead of standing here. Sir, Vikram's name was mentioned on the note. -We can't ignore it. -That's enough. I will handover Neha's case to Vikram. You're off this case. Come on, sir. You can't do this. What? Are you questioning my authority? No, sir. Vikram. How are you coping up? I was admitted in the hospital. What do you think? I am sorry. I had informed Neha for your betterment. Stop thinking about my betterment. How do you feel now? Did you find anything? Not yet. We're searching for the past five hours. Even the cadaver dogs are working. I wonder where the body is hidden. Wild shrub? We are trying but this is a wide area. We are searching. How much longer? We've called for one more team. But it's still going to take a couple of days. A couple days? Compare the mud samples from the cars tires, bike tires, and shoes of the people in our suspect list with the mud samples of this place. Okay. Rohit. Track everybody's phone location. -Find out who was the last person here. -Okay. And call me immediately if you find something. -Will do. -Vikram, this is Anirudh. He is a handwriting analyst. -Hello, sir. -Tell me. Could this be anyone from my suspect list? Here's the problem. Whoever has written this has purposely written it in small strokes. Had it been normal handwriting, we could have easily compared it. Sorry, sir. I can't analyze this. Did you find any fingerprints on the note? Sheela, Mohan, Lakshmi and your fingerprints have been detected. Neha's call records. There's nothing suspicious till the date she went missing. Any witness on the highway who saw that blue car? I questioned around 50 truck drivers who passed from there. Some mentioned about seeing Preeti's car but nobody spoke of a blue car. I'll call you back in sometime. Sir. How did you find that note? I was on my way to attend the puja and that's when I saw the note lying at the main door. Initially I thought it was a sales flyer, so I completely ignored it. But I noticed that the note was white and was an A4 size sheet, it caught my attention. I lost it when I read that note. And I came running to Mr. Mohan to tell him about this. Did you paint this? Yes, sir. It's really good. Can you compare the strokes of this painting with the note and confirm if the same person has drawn it? -I can, but… -But what? I could confirm it if I had the original painting. That's not possible. This is all I can give you. Sure, sir. No problem. All I am saying is, that I cannot tell you concretely. I can tell you for sure if they don't match. But if they match, it's just the guess work. Guess work is good. If they don't match, at least we can rule out Sheela. High possibility, sir. This note could have been written by Sheela. See this, sir. There is a slight difference between both the images. Observe the individual stroke length and the gap between them. It's almost the same. So, it is Sheela then. Maybe. But we cannot vouch for it. Vikram, should I apply for a search warrant? We could possibly find a clue in her house. Sir, is looking around my house necessary? It's a regular procedure. Preeti spent a lot of time here, right? So maybe we can find some clues. Okay, sir. You will have to come to our branch office once. -To record your statement. -Right, sir. Where's the key to this car? Rohit will coordinate the meeting time with you. -Whose car is this? -It's mine, sir. Why haven't I seen it before? It was under servicing. I received it today. Get the cover off. POLICE Get the keys to this car as well. Practice notes. -Arrest her. -Sir. Sir, let me explain. I will explain it to you, sir. Please, give me a chance. Sir, please listen to me. No. Leave me. Where are Neha and Preeti? Who is Neha, sir? I will not ask you again. Where are they? Who was the note about? I don't know, sir. Sir, I am really very scared. This… Whose body was mentioned in the note? Sir… I did write the note. But I have absolutely no connection with Preeti going missing. Then why did you write the note? Sir, I am a divorcee. You don't know how big of a stigma it is. Except for Preeti, no one even talks to me properly. So… I thought I would gain some attention in the colony… if I provided some clue and become a prime witness in your investigation. Do you think we are cunts? Do you think you'll get sympathy after hearing all this crap? It's the truth, sir. Don't waste my time, Sheela. Think about your daughter. Do you want to meet her again? Do you? So, tell me where are they? I swear on my child, sir. I don't know. You want attention, right? -Give her some attention. -Sir?! Sir! Sir. Sheela. Vikram plays a fair game. He doesn't differentiate between male and female. You would get the same treatment as any other male criminal. I can help you. Tell me the truth. I'll get you a fair trial. -Did she tell you anything? -No. If she really has attention seeking disorder, then there are chances that Preeti and Neha are safe. I think she's lying. Arrange for a polygraph test. We need her consent for it. I know. Even I won't go ahead without her consent. By the way, we tried to match the mud samples from Raja godown with those of the suspects. But there's no match. Same with maps data as well. Sheela was not in our suspect list back then, right? Anyway, take samples from Sheela's shoes and see if they match. Also call the forensics to comb her cars for trace evidence. Okay. Vikram. Sir. Did Sheela confess? Not yet, sir. I've arranged for a polygraph test. What about the consent? I'll get it. Give it your best shot. And remember… everything by the book. Sheela, this is a polygraph. It's also called a lie detector test. If you want me to trust you, then you have to get this test done. A mother would never swear on her child if she's a liar. We've come across many women like you. So, dialogues like these won't work on me. This is the only way to prove your innocence. Do I have your permission? How long you will refuse? I will get the court's permission and test you. There's no other alternative. Okay, sir. Take her signature on the consent form and start the procedure. Please advice her to relax. Take a deep breath and relax. Is your name Sheela? Yes, sir. Are you 38 years old? Yes, sir. Is Vijay your ex-husband? Yes. Did you kidnap Preeti? Did you kidnap Preeti? I am asking you one last time. Did you kidnap Preeti? No, sir. Do you know Neha? Sheela, is Neha still alive? Who's Neha? She is not lying, sir. But clearly her heart rate fluctuated when she was asked about Preeti and Neha. It's normal, sir. That's because she knows that those questions were very important. And the subject usually gets nervous at such questions. But most importantly, when she answered the questions, her pulse stabilized and so was her GSR and respiration. And according to my analysis, she is not lying, sir. According to your analysis, can the polygraph test be cheated? Sir… It's quite possible to cheat the polygraph test. If a person has the ability to control his breathing and heart rate. And it's not really difficult for a hardcore criminal. But I don't think she's that smart. Let me decide that. I am sorry, sir. Thank you. Arrange for a narco test. -Are you serious? -We don't have a choice. You know that it takes a long time to get permissions. I will speak to Justice Rathore. You go and collect the papers. He won't refuse me. Now you're getting personal. My name was written on the note, Rohit. That's when I knew my duty is over. Now everything is personal. Sheela. Sheela. She is fighting it. Sheela, don't fight. Let it happen. Sheela. Sheela. Sheela, can you hear me? Wake her up. -Sheela. -I'm list-- Sheela. -Did you kidnap Preeti? -Sir… Come here. Preeti! Yes. I don't think she can handle the dosage. She may not respond. Neha. Neha… Sheela, where's Neha? -Sheela, where's Neha? -Stop, just a second. -Sheela, where's Neha? -Vikram, stop! Sheela! -Sheela, what did you do with Neha? -Stop it. Sheela, please! Tell me! Where is Neha? Sheela, what did you do with her? Doctor one second. Sheela, where's Neha? Sheela. Where's Neha? Sheela, please. Sheela, Neha! -Where's Neha? -Vikram. INTERROGATION ROOM Neha. Have you lost it? Did you hear that? She spoke about Neha even without asking. I am sure she knows her whereabouts. Vikram! Stop it. Sit here. Sit. Sit. No matter whose permission you have the next time, but I am definitely not coming for the narco test. Bloody idiots. The department is full of hooligans. He should've asked you. I think you should speak to him. Vikram. Sir. Did you conduct a narco test? Yes, sir. But everything by the books, sir, as you asked. The book you're talking about has been written by officers like me. So don't you try and get smart with me. I know what had happened at the narco test. It won't take me that long to suspend you. Now get out. Get some tea for me. Look, my tea's gone cold. Get me also some. Ibrahim. Tell me, Ibrahim. I just saw Sheela's blue color car. The shade of the car that I saw was different than this. -Are you sure? -Yes. I just got a call from Mr. Saxena. We did not find any trace evidence related to Preeti and Neha from Sheela's car. Hello! What? They've found an unidentifiable dead body behind Raja godown. Vikram. Leave me! Who are you? Vikram! Let go off. Vikram! Vikram! -Vikram, get me out of here! -Sushmi. Let her go! -Let her go! -Vikram! -Get off her! -Please help me get out of here. -Sushmi! -Leave me! -No! -Vikram! Please help me get out of here. Hey, no! Please! Please. -Vikram. -Sushmi! Vikram! Vikram! Vikram. Vikram. Vikram. Neha is… The body… Send it to the forensics… and find out whether it's Preeti or Neha. Okay. Hello! Are you sure? Okay. The mud samples from Sheela's car match with the mud here. She was here. Whose dead body is it? Is it Preeti's? Or Neha's? What dead body are you talking about, sir? Don't fuck with me, Sheela! We found a dead body in the exact location you told us about. So, just bloody tell me! Who did you kill and bury behind the godown? No, sir. Sir, I promise. -I didn't do it, sir. -Sheela, I will kill you, I swear! -Tell me! -No, sir. Please, sir. I didn't do it. I promise I didn't do it. Sir, please. -Constables. -Sir. Constables! Sir. Give her third-degree until she gives us the details. Vikram. Vikram… it's Preeti's body! Preeti was a good friend of yours. Why did you kill her? Sir, I did not kill her. I want your confession. Where's Neha? Sir, I don't know who Neha is. Please let me go. No! Where's Neha? Just a minute. Vikram, there's a call from the forensic. -Hello. -We've analyzed Preeti's body for trace evidence. We've found a DNA from her fingernails. Is it Sheela's? No. It's Ajay's! Ajay? Any sign of rape or semen traces? No, nothing. Go and get Ajay immediately. If you want all of this to stop, then tell us the truth. We are anyway arresting Ajay. He will spill the beans. Why don't you question him if you have your doubts on him? Why are you torturing me? INTERROGATION ROOM Vikram… Ajay is missing. What?! I asked you to keep an eye on him. You had one job! I am given a lot of work! I have my informer who is tracking him. His phone is not reachable either. We will know once he contacts me. I will be back. -Hello! -We found one more DNA on Preeti's tooth. -Whose is it? -Mohan, Preeti's father. And one more thing. We spotted a gray hair on Preeti's thigh. It matches with Saraswati. We found one more DNA that's all over her body. It doesn't match with anybody from your suspect list. What's wrong? Mohan's DNA has been found on Preeti's tooth. And a strand of Sarawati's hair on her thigh. One more unidentified DNA is found. It's all a collusion, Rohit. Seems like they formed a syndicate to kill her. Call them. Tell them that it's a routine investigation. Did you find Ajay? I didn't get any message from the informer. He told us about his granny's place. -Sambar. -Okay. Send in some constables and get him here. Okay. Vikram… Mohan, Lakshmi and Sarawati are kept in holding cells. -Did they resist? -No. Everyone came without questioning. My informer has messaged. You were right. Ajay is in Sambar. When did he come here? Since this morning. I tailed him with great effort. He seems to be disturbed. Is anybody inside the hut? No, I don't think so. We have to get into that hut, Rohit. Now is the right time to get in. What's up? What is this? It's the fresh stock. Bunty! Bunty! -Bunty! -Catch him. Fuck! So, this is your granny's house. And he's your granny? Why are you chasing me, sir? You have no idea about the mess you're into. Now tell me why were you hiding here? Or else you will be beaten to death. I lied to you. Preeti was my girlfriend. I miss her a lot. After I heard about her death, I wanted to forget everything. And that's why I came here. Wanted to be high? And you… you didn't mend even after getting arrested. Remove your shirt. Sir? -Remove your shirt. -I've told you the truth, sir. What are you staring at? What are you staring at? What are you staring at? Stand up. What is this mark? I don't remember. Maybe I got hurt when I was a kid. Rohit… arrest them. And send his DNA to the forensic. -You mean, of Bunty? -Yes. Tell them to compare it with the unidentified DNA found on the dead body. Okay. Come on. Preeti is no more. Lakshmi. We found your DNA on Preeti's teeth. How did it come there? Do you think we are cunts? Are you trying to mislead us? Alright. Bunty is clear. His DNA didn't match. Where's Sapna? With your mother? Yes. I told her that I might return by morning. I asked her to not wait for me. Are you sure she is at the hospital? Yes, why? What happened? Bring her. What's happening, Vikram? Rohit, what's happening? I don't know either. You never told me that you knew Preeti. Who is Preeti? The one you grew up with in Saraswati's orphanage. How do you know Saraswati? She told me that one more girl was shortlisted along with Preeti at the time of adoption. But that family wanted only one girl and they chose Preeti. And that the other girl was very angry about this. Do you know who the other girl was? It was me, Vikram. Why didn't you tell me that you knew Preeti? Because I didn't know that she was the same Preeti who had gone missing. She went to America after she was adopted. I had no clue that she had come back to India. Rohit doesn't tell me anything about his cases. Rohit, tell him. Hey! Just relax and answer his questions. You think I am still mad at Preeti? And that's the reason I… You will stay here… till we get the DNA results. Vikram. I didn't know that Sapna and Preeti are from the same orphanage. Or I would've have asked her. Her childhood was really tough. We don't really talk about it. You always advise me to not get emotionally attached to my cases. Yeah. Do what you need to do. Mr. Saxena, I want these reports urgently. And let me know if this is our fourth unidentified DNA. Hello! Sir, a girl is here at the police station. I think she has some information regarding your case. Tell her to wait. I am coming. Yes. What's the matter? Actually, I was on the highway and I pulled over when I got a phone call. Suddenly another car came and stopped right beside my car. The driver signaled me to roll down my car window. I got scared and started driving. He followed me for some distance. I took the next exit for Daulatnagar and headed here directly. -Which car was it? -Ambassador. Are you sure it was ambassador? I am sure, sir. It was a white ambassador. How did he look like? He had a wheatish complexion and had beard as well. He was wearing a black cap and sunglasses. Can you come to our head office? -Right now? -You need to help with his sketch. It will just take half an hour. I need the CCTV footage. Really? Who are you? Police. Sorry, sir. Give me the date and time. From 9:00 a.m. onward. He chased you for some time, right? It's possible that he exited from Daulatnagar. Eesha, are you sure that it was a white ambassador? Yes, sir. He asked me first and now you're asking the same question. I'm done, sir. -Was it him? -No, sir. Nothing matches except for the cap and the sunglasses. Can you stay a bit longer? It is already late, sir. My mother is calling me continuously. I've to go, sir. Can we do this tomorrow? Okay. Mansingh. Yes, sir. Drop her her home. And be on guard outside her house. Sure, sir. -And get him trained to draw well. -Yes, sir. Please come, ma'am. The car is nowhere to be seen on the CCTV. Pause. Rewind. Pause. Sir. MAHAVIR COURIER SERVICE What happened? Sir, here are the reports. What happened, Vikram? Play the footage of the day when Preeti went missing. MAHAVIR COURIER SERVICE Pause. As per the reports, when did Ibrahim see Preeti for the last time? -Around 6:00 p.m. -Right, 6:00 p.m. Check the exit time of this truck. Half an hour after Ibrahim saw Preeti. Play today's footage. MAHAVIR COURIER SERVICE Pause. Eesha exited at 9:30 a.m. And this truck exited at 10:00 a.m. Exactly after half an hour. Though the number plates vary, the truck and driver are the same. See this. Black cap and goggles. Do me a favor. Check the transport divisions' database. -Yes, what's it? -Sir, here's Sapna's DNA Reports. It's negative, right? Both the number plates are fake. We have our guy. He's our fourth unidentified DNA. Zoom in. Call Mr. Saxena and ask him to depixelate the photo. And send the screenshot to me. I am sorry, Vikram. He has a cap in both the pictures which puts the face in an underexposed area. It is not possible to depixelate it. What wrong? Nothing, sir. Are you stuck somewhere? I'm scared. What happened with Sushmi, shouldn't happen with Neha. Vikram. Let bygones be bygones. You can't drive looking into the rare view mirror. Take it as a minor speed breaker. I'm confident that you will catch this son of a bitch. DAULATNAGAR POLICE STATION JAIPUR RURAL -Constable. -Yes, sir. I need the profile of every criminal in this area. Sure, sir. Rohit, come to the Daulatnagar police station. Right now. Here you go, sir. I'll get you the rest of the files as well. CASE FILE What happening, constable? Mr. Vikram asked for the criminals list. His name should be on the list as well. He's a dacoit in the name of police. Just that his name means "brave and strong." But in reality, he's a demon. Enough is enough. I will teach you a lesson. Hello. Connect me to Mr. Shekhawat. I know he isn't in the office. That's why I called you. Where's he? Try it again. Try it from the home. Try it now. Keep trying. Hello! Yes, sir. Sir, I am sorry, I'm calling so late. Sir, Vikram just brought me to the police station in front of everyone. Yes, in front of everyone! Sir, not me. I can't wait till tomorrow. Sir, you need to take an action. This is not done, sir. You must suspend him. POLICE FAHAD SERVICE SCOOTER Sir, I don't know. Hello! Where is this mechanic? We haven't seen him for the past couple of days. Do you know where he lives? I have no idea. Ibrahim! Is Ibrahim home? -Yes, sir. -Ibrahim. Do you remember your scooter mechanic's house? Are you talking about Fahad? His shop is nearby. But he lives in the outskirts. Take me there. Don't bother. I will bring him. Do as I say. Come on. Okay, I'll just change and come. Hurry up. Let's go, sir. Can I say something if you're not offended? I know you will always doubt me. I said I trust you. No, you don't. But try and trust me, sir. Sir, that is where he lives. That's the blue car I saw. Where is Neha? Where is Neha? Where is Neha? Where is Neha? Where is Neha? Fahad! Sir. Sir. What happened, sir? What's wrong, sir? What happened? Sir… Ibrahim… Where is Neha? Where is Neha?! I have no idea, sir. I was hired to do this. Who hired you? I'll take you along. That's where he stays. Let me come with you. No. Call for back up. Tell them to come without a siren. Meanwhile, if something goes wrong, kill this idiot. Hey! What are you doing here? -You're finally home. -What do you mean? Come, sit. Sit. Have you done all this? Why? Where's Neha, Rohit? Rohit! Don't move! Just relax! Breath! Everything is over now. I've been wanting to confess this to you for a long time now. But the truth can never be hidden from you. -Rohit! -But I can't even tell you the truth. There… I thought I would never know why Rohit did all this. But Rohit always said… no one can ever keep the truth hidden from you. Why did you do all this, Sapna? It all started at Saraswati ma'am's orphanage. Preeti and I grew up together at the orphanage. We were best friends. SARASWATI ORPHANAGE I was around 14, when I realized that… our feelings meant more than friendship. My feelings towards her were pure. I never thought that I was doing something wrong. But for some reason… Ms. Saraswati didn't like it. -And she separated us. -What are you doing? Preeti, let's go. She somehow managed to tear us apart. Back then, Mohan's brother and his wife were there to adopt a girl. They liked two girls. One of them was Preeti… and the second one was me. They chose Preeti over me. But Preeti also… chose them over me. I used to miss Preeti a lot. My feelings for her grew stronger with time. Ms. Saraswati persuaded me that this was just a phase. And that with time I'll learn to get on with it. And so, I buried my feelings deep inside. When I grew up, I befriended Rohit. I never realized that Rohit was falling in love with me. He waited two years for me. I couldn't break his heart. So, I agreed to get married. But there was awkwardness in our relationship. Rohit never understood what was wrong, nor could I muster the courage to explain him. Hey, give it to me. -Yeah. What is it? -Here hold this. Target the middle one. Preeti! Come here. You're Preeti from Saraswati's orphanage, right? Yeah, but how do you know? Didn't you recognize me, Preeti? Sapna. Oh, Sapna! Oh my God! I can't believe this. How are you? I can't believe it either. I missed you so much. -Preeti! Come here. -Hey, listen! We'll catch up later. Message me on the gram. Preeti Mathur. Bye. Looking at her after all these years brought back all the feelings that I had kept buried inside of me. I couldn't control my emotions. I love you, Preeti. Sorry! What? I always been wanting to tell you this but I couldn't muster courage to speak up. Hey, no! Listen. I guess there's a huge misunderstanding, Sapna. I'm straight, okay? No offense. But, I don't love you. I was in depression for a long time. I was confident that Preeti had also buried her feelings for me. She was forced to stay quiet. My depression worsened with time and it turned into madness. I had to talk to her at any cost. I didn't realize that what I was doing was wrong. We used to get our car serviced from Fahad. One day he needed some money so he asked for it. You will get the money. But you will have to do me a favor. Tell me, how did you manage to do this? Ma'am provoked me to do it. I was just doing as told. It was Sapna who planned it all. I wanted to meet Preeti before taking any further steps. Hello, Preeti. I've asked you several times to not call me. Look, I am not interested in talking to you. It triggered my anger even more. And hence, I gave Fahad a go ahead for the plan. MAHAVIR COURIER SERVICE It's just the two of us. You don't have to be scared. I just… I just want to talk. You've lost your mind. I just want to talk to you. -Please… -Listen to me. Don't you get it? I love you. Sapna, are you hurt? Sapna! Sapna! What happened? Are you okay? I am so sorry, Rohit. It was an accident. Why would I kill her? I loved her. I am sorry, Rohit. I told her everything. Rohit! I want to surrender. Let's go to the police station. Let's go. Get me arrested. After some days, Preeti's case was transferred in HIT. Neha started analyzing the evidences. The needle found at Preeti's crime scene was sent for analysis. No blood or DNA is traced. But we found this partial finger print. And it is of one of these three people. Can you help me narrow it down? Yes, get me the printout. I will speak with the fingerprint bureau. Cool. But Rohit was scared that Neha will pass this information to Saini once he returned. We kept Neha in our house. We never intended to kill her. We were going to shift to South Africa. But we couldn't leave from India until we sent Rohit's mom to Delhi. Then we'd have released Neha. What about Fahad? Would he have let go Neha? Sheela actually wrote that note for the attention. We got a chance to divert the case. Rohit dug out Preeti's body again. He collected the DNA samples of all the suspects without your knowledge to divert you. He implanted those evidences on Preeti's body. And buried her back behind Raja Godown. In the same way, he contaminated the mud samples of Sheela's car tires and shoes. Rohit did not try to frame anyone. He was just trying to buy some more time. What about Eesha? Why did you want to kidnap her? Who's Eesha? It's all about money, sir! So I tried to kidnap Eesha. Rohit was protecting me. That's all. I am sorry. Had I not stopped Sapna in childhood… Preeti would be alive. There's no excuse for murder. You're not responsible for Sapna's crime. Sapna's feelings for Preeti was also not a crime. Everyone has to die someday. But what hurts the most is that death knocks on your door when you least expect it to. If not for you, my daughter's soul wouldn't rest in peace. Thanks to you… we can at least give her a respectful funeral. The unidentified DNA found on Preeti's body matches Rohit's DNA. Dear Vikram, I know that you will solve this case and find me. And when you come for me, I will try shoot you with my gun. But my gun won't have any bullets. Only your bullet can give me an honorable death. It was nice working with you. Your friend forever, Rohit. Tell me what happened, Vicky. Some other time. Let's go. Come. SARASWATI ORPHANAGE Vikram!
