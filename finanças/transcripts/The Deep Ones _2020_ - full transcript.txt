Well howdy there, folks. You going to Solar Beach Colony? Yes. Free shuttle! Where'd you two meet? The airport. The bar in the airport. All right, we're getting close, folks. What did you do? You pressed your nose against the glass? No, it was one-way glass, I didn't know this and... there she is on the other side making fun of me because my nose is... - He was like pressed... - Pressed... - Up against the glass. - Against the glass. It was so cute, he was checking me out. He didn't know that I could see him. Wow. Where's the box? He said it was gonna be on the door. Surprise! Mr. Marsh! Not so formal, call me Russel. Hi. And this is my better half, Ingrid. Hi, hello. - Hello. - Hi. And this is my lesser half, Petri. Fine Finnish name and what a grip. You too. - Thank you. - You've been to Finland? In my youth. Port of Helsingin Satama, beautiful women. Beautiful women. Well, come on, let me help you with these. Right this way. - Thank you. - Don't be shy. - Right this way. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you, yes. Hello. Is that a view or what? Wow. That's amazing! You must be thirsty after your long trip. Ingrid! Yes, dear? Fetch us some wine, please. Wow. Let me give you the 10 cent tour. Mr. Marsh, do you rent this place often? Once or twice a year, and please call me Russel. None of that. None of that. Thank you. Just one is fine. They say more than one glass can harm the baby, so... Actually, new studies have shown that even one glass can be harmful. Do you have children? I, well we were... We recently had a miscarriage. My God, I'm... What do those supposed experts know anyway, right? Every woman's body is different. You're going to make a wonderful mother. I can see it in your eyes. You have really good energy. Really good. Both of you. Yeah, yeah, good. Good energy. This... wine is marvelous. Where is it from? Russel makes it. Really? Well, the community and I do. But don't worry, my stinky feet didn't stomp on the grapes. At this point, I wouldn't mind. Community, you say? Well, the Solar Beach Colony, yeah. The neighbors around here, we're part of a seaside commune. We grow our own organic vegetables, makes our own wine, raise chickens. You know, bee keeping for honey. We even have our own bakery. You name it, someone in our kooky group is into it. That's amazing. A lot of people in Finland are also going back to this old world way of doing things. It's really refreshing in today's age of this technological... Infection. Yes. Yeah. Yes. It's as if we're addicted to our phones and our gadgets and social media. It's like a transmittable disease. Yeah. How long have you two been married? Three years. 20 minutes ago. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. This is sort of our second honeymoon. Very romantic. Yes. Ingrid, I think we should go, yes, and... Leave these lovebirds alone. Yes, thank you. Thank you, dear. Yes. Okay. I feel a bit weird that you guys are leaving your own house. No, no, not at all, not at all. We did the rental because we didn't want the house sitting around empty. But I make a few bucks, right? Where do you guys go? - If you don't mind me asking. - Well, since the pregnancy we've been living on the boat, you know? - Yeah. - The waves help to calm the little booger. - Really? - Yeah, calm the little baby. Yeah, hey, mother happy. The ocean is the mother of us all. I mean, it provides everything we need. Speaking of provides, Petri, there's more wine underneath - the kitchen cabinet. - No. Along with two sets of keys. Thank you, Russel. And if you need anything, please, - just call Russel's cellphone. - Just call us. That's right. We'll be here in a jiffy. Thank you. - Okay. - Two miles away. - That's a strong handshake. - And you're welcome on - the boat any time. - It was so nice to meet you. Okay? - I love boats. - All right, have fun, kids. - I love boats. - See you around. - Goodnight. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. That woman, it's terrible. Well, she's probably homeless. I don't know. It's okay. She'll be okay. Let's go back inside. Wow, I thought they would never leave. Baby. yeah. Fuck me. Fuck me. Yeah. Yeah. Where's my baby? Where's my baby? Where's my baby? Petri. He's dead. No. No! He's dead. God. Gross. God. Jesus! Fuck. Petri? Baby? Petri. Fuck. Petri. Baby. Morning run, butterfly. - God morgon. - Ingrid! What is the secret of these eggs‚Äù? It's clam juice. - Clam juice. - Fresh clams! There we go. I'm so sorry for showing up - unannounced but... - Good morning, sleepyhead. We realized we didn't stock up food for you two and so Russel thought, hey, let's go over, - make them some breakfast! - You have to try these eggs. Make them feel at home. They are incredible! Perfect! Ingrid. The clam juice. - You've got to try it! - I'm not feeling well. Russel thought we'd come make you breakfast. It's probably jet lag. I'm making her - a portion too. - I'll go check on her. - Yeah. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - She'll feel good if I make a little breakfast for her. God. Lexi, you okay? Yeah. It's just my stomach is upset is all. Can I get you anything? Maybe. He saw me naked. What? Yeah. From the window. Mr. Furley was out there clamming. Mr. Furley. And he saw your clam? Knock it off, that's not funny. I know. It's not. You know the position of the sun and the window... There is no way he saw anything. Glare and all. Bull, he saw everything. What time did they show up? Around six, I think. Great. Early birds who like to pop in. They wanted to know if we wanted to go out on their boat. Today? I will tell them no. We'll do it another day - when you feel better. - You know what, no, I'm just gonna end up sleeping it off all day. You go, have a good time. But you're sick. Baby, it's just my stomach combined with the flight is all. Go. You know how much you like boats. Go hang out with your newfound weirdos. Weirdos? You noticed the mirror? Yeah. Bow-chicka-bow-bow. You call me if you need anything. I will. Over and out. Finn. I'm sorry it took so long. After we lost him. It just didn't feel right to try, you know? I know. It feels right now. Yes it does. I love you. I love you. Tummy, feel better. Yeah, this is Finley. Is the doctor in? Gene. Yeah, it's time to make the house call. At Russel's place and she'll be sleeping. Beautiful day. Beautiful. That's an interesting tattoo. It's a symbol that an old world is dying and a new world is about to be born. The three prongs. And old adage of Templar meaning, one can not retreat in battle until you are faced with numbers of three to one. And the group mind expects the last to be worst than the first. The group mind? Who's thirsty? We are. Perfect timing. Coming right up. A wonderful wine in spritzer form. Thank you. Lovely, lovely. Kippis. That's what we say in Finland. Kippis. - Kippis. - Kippis. I like that, I like that. - Kippis. - Yeah. She's something, isn't she? Excuse me? The boat. Yes, yes, it's very big. Big, small. Very big. I went around the world in a sailboat once. Really? Yes. When I first saw the light. Cthulhu. - Cthulhu? - Yeah. What, the light, what does that mean? You smoke? Marijuana? Marijuana. Sure. We grow it ourselves. The commune. Yes. Okay. Very potent. Okay. Well, I have to warn you. I get a little loopy when I smoke. We don't mind loopy, do we, dear? No. Okay. I told you. This is strong. Yes. It'll help you focus for your journey. Journey? Yes. Is there... What was the word you said before, it was ca-ca-catoohoo? Cthulhu. See the light? Focus. Focus. Yes. Look at the light. Smaller and smaller, until you see yourself at the edge of the world. Do not fear this awakened state. Petri? You see the light? I see the light. Nothing but the light. Nothing but the light. Get down on your knees. Reeves. Close your eyes. That's good boy. That's good, now listen. That's good. Let itin. Perfect body, perfect mind. Open your heart. Yes. Yes. No! Let me die, let me die! Let me die! Dagon, come! No! No! No! Do you see the light? No! Open your eyes. What's in the way is the way. Relax. Relax. Reeves, get him up. That's it. You all right? Did he speak to you? Yes. Good. Good, good! Reeves, tell the others. We are so happy for you, Petri! It's a great honor for the Old One to choose you. You will remember none of this when you awaken. Just a feeling of joy and gratitude towards Ingrid and myself. Do you understand? Yes. When you hear the click of the lighter, you'll be awake. I told you that was strong shit. Here. You're thirsty. Throat burns. Real OG kush, as they say. I don't think I've ever had marijuana affect me like that. I think I blacked out. There's nothing in the world like what we grow. Does have the same end result. What's that? I'm starving. Well let's eat. Okay, I'll get the clams, coming right up. I'll help. No, no, no, your stay put. Ingrid and I will get it together and we'll bring it up to you. You just sit back and soak up the rays. Good. Good. The Deep One leads. It's all above. Coming! Hello. You must be Alexandria. Yes. I am Dr. Gene Rayburn. Heard weren't feeling well, so Russel sent me over to see if I could be of any assistance. You shouldn't have come all that way. Dear, it's no trouble at all. I live just up the road. Besides, Russel would never forgive me if I didn't make house calls to all and everyone in our little community. Well, in that case, please come in. Thank you. Would you like some coffee? That would be wonderful. Lovely. Tell me what's ailing you. Honestly, I really feel like it's just jet lag. Let me be the judge of that. One, two. Your pulse is fantastic. Good. On any medications? No. Any family medical issues? No, actually my... My grandparent... My grandparents are... Breathe. 96 and 98. My parents are the pillar of health. Impressive. Yeah, we're lucky. Breathe. Okay, now say, aw. Aw. Aw. Aw. Okay, very good. Um... Actually, about four months ago I did have a miscarriage. But my doctor back home said that everything is in great working order and... How old are you? 41. That's how old I was when I had my child. - Really? - Yes. You are the perfect age. My little girl is an excellent specimen. That's really comforting because we want children so much. Of course you do. A child completes a woman. Motherhood just brings us full circle. I guess. Wow, that's really relaxing. What is that? Vista valley point. Acupressure. Wonderful for anxiety. Yeah, I feel like taking a nap. Acupressure? As old as time. Would you mind giving me some samples? Um... Is that necessary? With your miscarriage, I feel it's best not to take any chances. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. But, of course, if you're uncomfortable, we don't have to... No, no, no, I want... I would like to. If you would be so kind, give me a little but of pittle. You got it. Thank you. Yes. I'll be right back. Here you are. Fantastic. Is this the way? - Yes. - Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm feeling better already. I should have your test results by this evening. Great. I'm having a little get-together at my home. I would really love it if you and your husband would attend. I don't... Come on. Russel and Ingrid will be there. Can I bring a friend? Yes. Sure. Fun sort of date. Russel will give you directions. Thank you so much. Bye, thank you. Have you seen my Jasmine? No, let me see... You're in danger. They're watching all of us. They took my Jasmine. I don't understand. I see them. I see them for what they are. Lurking inside. Chanting at night. They need a woman. Trust no one! Leave here! Leave here before they get you! There's one! There! Hi there. I see you've met our Miss Zadok. I don't know, she seems really upset. No, she's quite harmless. She had a daughter just ran off and then the bank repoed her house and just kinda set her over the edge. So now she goes around setting up those flier, saying how everybody's out to get her. I guess stress can do crazy things. Yeah, it sure can. I'm Constable Legrasse. I am Solar's top cop. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. Actually, I'm their only cop. You see, crime is pretty non-existent around this beautiful paradise, here. I don't even wear a gun. Like Andy Griffith. It's from "The Andy Griffith Show." Television. Yeah. Yeah. I don't own one. Interesting. Well, I just want to stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood and make sure everything was all right. Well, thank you. You're welcome. Could you just check her out, make sure she's okay? Yeah, will do. All right. - Thanks so much. - Goodnight, ma'am. Goodnight. That was fun. - Here we go. - That was really fun, yes. Here we are. You okay? Thank you both so much. I had a great time. It was our pleasure. Will you come to the party? If my little butterfly is feeling better. I'm sure she'll be fine. It's the third house down on the right. Eight o'clock. Third house down on the right, eight o'clock. - Yep. - Got it. We'll see you there, buddy. - Okay. - Bye. - Okay, bye. - Chow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. And, baby, how you doing? I'm doing good. I miss it, it's like your answering machine. I know, I've gotta change that. Whatever. Lucy, I'm home. Ricky! Waaaa. Hil Deb! Hey. Longtime no see. Not since the wedding. Mwuah. Mwuah. You look great. Well you're not so shabby yourself. Hey, watch it! - Come on. - You look great too. - Hi. - I see... I have to stand up here, you tall man. Someone is feeling better. Much... better, fishy. Nice. You were on a boat. Hi. Not drinking Russel's wine I see. No. Deb brought the good old-fashion, non-organic - chemical infused kind. - The best kind. How was the boat? It was such great fun. Yeah? Yeah, did those weirdos adopt you yet? I see you told her about our friendly innkeepers and their mirror. Of course. Did they tell you that they sent over their doctor friend to check me out? Yes, yes. How was that? She was... She was an interesting character. She invited us over to her commune get-together party tonight. And the constable stopped over to welcome us too. Constable. Yeah, the police man. Solar's top cop. Fighting crime without a gun. Was he nice? Yeah, he was fine. He stopped that crazy house watcher. You gotta tell him how the old doctor made her pee in a cup. Weird. - You know what... - They're good people. They're just concerned is all. I think in today's world that's pretty amazing. What's so weird about it? I'm kidding. Baby. Sure you were. - Yeah, okay. - Baby? It's okay, I'm gonna go take a shower. I'll see you guys at the party. You're coming, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. We're coming. Boy. I gotta meet these people now. They really have him on a hook, hey? You know, I think he just see Russel as some sort of father figure, you know, after he lost his dad. And what about the pregnant chick? He probably just wants to fuck her. What? Yeah. You know some guys are into that. No. My God, when I was showing, he wanted it everywhere, every minute. On the floor, in the bathroom... Okay, I got it. - Bedroom floor. - That's enough. - In the den. - Got it, okay, I miss you. I miss you too. I check my nails... What about the friend? Wait till you go through menopause, then you'll see bloating. We'll take care of her if need be. Splendid. We're going to a clam bake. Do you have her results? And the best part, she's ovulating. Madness rides the star-wind. Yes. Claws and teeth sharpened on century of corpses. Dripping death astride a bacchanal of bats from night-dark ruins of buried temples of Belia. Glorious! Glorious. Yes! No! I didn't tell anyone. Look away. I did not see. Merciful gods of earth, I am falling into the sky. You remember his writings, don't you. Such madness. What do you want of me then? Everything. What have they done to my Jasmine? You brought her to us. You gave her to him willingly. No, I didn't take her away. You knew. You made your choice. What was that? Listen. God. Bring her home. He already has. Beyond the bounds of man and beast and all eternity. Don't you hear? Listen. He comes to you, like in a bad dream. What was that? Stop it! What is out there? Open the door. Don't be afraid. Jasmine awaits. That can't be. Let her in. Let her in. Look at the sacrificial lamb. Lie! They lie! They took her to the seal Yes. And she returns, reborn, more radiant. God, keep me from the chasm of sleep. Death is merciful, for there is no return there from but with Him, peace rests evermore. That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die. Stop it! What is that? Open the door. Mother? Jasmine! Mother. Jasmine! No! Get off! Take her home, Jasmine. Take her home. Alexandria. You came. Are you feeling better? Yes, this is for you. Thank you. This is my husband, Obed. Obed, that's an interesting name. Family name. Pleasure is mine. I can assure you. Such beautiful people. Thank you, this is my husband, Petri. - Petri? - And our friend, Debbie. It's a family name from Finland. and what a fine specimen you are. My compliments, Alexandria. Come, come. Nice people, right? Okay. Lovely dress. Thank you. Is that from Target? Tarjay. Beautiful home. Come, children. Meet the Solar Beach colony. Welcome Petri, Alexandria and Debbie. So happy you made it. Please, make yourselves at home. Come, Petri. I'll introduce you to our group. Excuse me, ladies. Hi. Would you like some of our homemade wine? Do you have tequila? Straight? Yeah, I'm gonna have the same. Thank you, Ingrid. Okay, good, I'll get it. You're in for a life check. So wonderful. Yes. Lovely. - Yeah. - Yeah. I have seen the universe through his eyes. And even the skies of spring and flowers of summer be poison to me. Thou has come. - Petri, welcome. - Welcome. He's such a wonderful man. I know. Anything you want. I'm here to serve you. Welcome. We move as one. As one! - As one. - As one. Hi. Welcome, I am Hodges. Welcome. - He's the one. - Yes.

You've already met Obed. - Very nice. - This is his home. Beautiful house. Good. Do you all approve? Yes. No. Yeah. - How could they... - Your test results came in. Perfect bill of health. What a relief. - Yes. - Thank you so much. Do you often do house calls, Doctor? Yes. To everyone in our community, especially if they are friends of Russel's. Well do you have any rentals available? You would have to talk to our local realtor, Finely. Yeah, I was just kidding. Of course you were. If you'll excuse me, I must attend to our other guests. Sure. That is one strange bitch. I don't think she enjoys your sarcasm either. Obviously. You know, I think this whole Solar Beach community is a little Stepford-like, right? Well, Petri seems to fit in real well. You know, I always thought of him as more of an introvert. He is. Well, not here. Tell me about it. Your libations have arrived. Finally. Thank you so much, Ingrid, thank you. That's strong. Is it too much? - No. - No. It's great. - Let it. - Let's, yeah. Thank you. Tell me, Ing, how long have you been with Russel? Nine months today. Nice, nice. So you must be due any day now. Yeah. It's about to pop out. I can tell. Okay. Okay, I'll be back. Okay. Try not to break your water. - Quit. - What? - What? - You're terrible. Having fun? You know, just a couple more of these and I'll be fine. She's a pistol. Finley, refills over here. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. How are you doing, butterfly? I'm fine. What were you fellas talking about? Moving here. What? Yes. Russel said that he could possibly line up a job for me. Are you married? No, divorced. Children? I have one. So that was the best thing out of that guy? Yes. You really are lovely. Yeah, well, thank you. I hope you're able to kinda stay with us for awhile. You know, I am gonna try. I've got like some other things, like... I have to... - Yeah? - Something, I forgot. I gotta work or something. - Seriously? - I have my kid, you know. This is crazy. Petri, Petri? Cuban time!

No problem, it wasn't important or anything. Excuse me, here I am with the refill. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Finley. Excuse me. It's Cuban time. How old do you think that man is? I just can't even believe he said that right now. - Something's going on. - Said what? - Something really weird... - Ladies! - Is going on. - Ladies! Such sights, such sights. We have a wonderful fire show. It's known to make women fertile just at the sight of it. Please, please. - Come, come, come, come. - Let's go. You too. - Thank you. - Strap yourselves in and enjoy. She's really good. Thank you for making me laugh right now. God knows I need it. I just love hanging out with you. I missed you. I missed you too. What is that? I like your mask. Children can be such a handful sometimes. Excuse us, ladies. Abgal, we best be going. It's been quite a long day for all of us. Excuse us. My baby likes you. I know her father will like you too. Excuse me? Father will like me too? What kind of language was that? Like, I don't... That was quite the show! Here. Look at the light, Petri. Petri, you see the light? Look into the light. Look into the light. There it is. Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful. Look at your wife. Let's grab the life of the party before he buys a house boat. Poor doctor's feelings. I don't care. Petri. Petri. Let's go. I think Petri's gonna stay with us a little longer if you don't mind. Petri? I'd like to stay with them a little bit longer if you don't mind. Don't worry. We'll take good care of him. Is this the way home? Yes, that way. Don't worry, they'll take good care of me. Bye, Alex. Bye. Bye, Debbie. So freaking weirded out. This is a creepy staircase. Jesus. That was the most bizarre bunch of people I've ever met. Okay, and I have been to Burning Man twice but these people go way beyond. My God, Deb, don't you think that I should've dragged Petri out of there? I mean, we still have six days left on this house. What is that? Is that a little girl on the porch? Alone? At this time of night? Wow. Okay, let's do it. Hello. Hi. Hi, are you friends with my mommy? I don't know, who's your mommy? She has pretty hair like you. Thank you. Look at her fingers. They're webbed. Soft. Where is your mommy? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. We're not strangers. Can I see? Don't touch me! Don't worry, okay, we're not gonna hurt you. They'll hurt you. Shit. Jesus. Let's get the hell out of here. My God, Halloween in June. My God, what was that? Creepy as fuck. What is going on? I don't know. I think everyone is fucking with everyone. My God. Do you need a drink? Are you kidding me? After that, what do you think? A double. Make mine a triple. You got it. At least we're away from the weirdos. My gosh, okay, we're doing a shot. This one is down the hatch. Till we get the other one. To us. Salute. This is an interesting collection. They're really into Lovecraft. Look at this. What is that? Looks like some old photos or something. Whoa. Here's a letter. These are really old. Yeah. So many women. From Ingrid Krauer. Ingrid? Ingrid. Yeah. To Rosa and Max Krauer in Switzerland. Maybe that's their last name. Yeah. Should I open it? No. Too late. Deb! Come on. Let's see. My God, girl, look. This is dated like almost 10 months from today. Is that in German? Okay. My high school kraut is a little rusty but I think I can probably make out some bits of this. Wow. This is weird. It says I've lost my phone and my passport. "And I am feeling a profound sense of dread." You're making this up. No! No, I'm not. I mean, I know it's not like spot on but I'm getting the gist of it. "I feel like the end is near. "I'm gonna run tonight, if you don't hear from me "before you get this. - "I pray that I see you again." - Wow. That's really creepy. Yeah. That's gotta be a joke, right? No, you know what, listen, I've heard about some of these cults, all right? Cult? And they're into all this Necronomicon stuff. Maybe Russel and that colony is into weird shit like that. Sorry. It's the sitter, hang on. Hello? Is everything okay? Bye. Honey, I'm so sorry, the sitter has to leave. No. I know, you know how these teenagers are these days. You know, probably has a boyfriend or something. I get it. I know this is the worst time to leave you. Are you okay? Yeah, it's fine. I'm just, yeah, this has got to be a joke. Right, it's... I just, she's pregnant with his baby. So I don't exactly think she's being held against her will. So... Unless they brainwashed her. Come on, Deb. Don't creep me out. Okay, I am just kidding, okay? Just when you're gonna leave, - I mean... - I'm sorry, baby. Listen, you know what, just give me the letter, okay? For what? I am gonna contact Morticia's parents. It's easy enough, - here's the address. - And say what to them? I'm gonna tell them that we found a letter addressed to them from her. And then we'll go from there. Right? - I mean... - Okay. If they say that she's been missing or something, then we know that we've got some weird Jim Jones things. Very funny. Okay, I'm kidding. I'm sure it's nothing. Please. Do you and Petri just wanna come stay with me? Thank you, no, I'm gonna text him and get his butt back over here and figure out what the heck is going on. Okay, yeah. This is so creepy, are you okay to drive? Mmmmm. I'm fine. You sure, please call me... - I love you. - When you get home. You know I would never not. Walk me out? Yes. Love you, I'll call you after. Okay. This is so fucking... Where's my phone? My God. My phone. What the? My God! What are you doing out here? You could've been killed. Do you understand me? Do you? Debbie, Debbie. Please, help me. Russel. Debbie, there's been a rash of hit and runs in this area. So tragic. I was hit? How was I hit? What a shame. Without a mother. Who knows how it'll turn out? No. Please, I... Help. Stop! Where the fuck is my phone? I fucking do? Jesus fuck! Where the fuck is my... Fuck, where's my phone? God. Petri. God. God. Petri. You fucking perverts. My God. Fucker. Motherfucker.

Please, Petri, please. - The light is here. - Please. Hello, Alex. Found your little spy camera. That's too bad. I didn't want this to be a frightening experience for you. Conception should be a joyous occasion. Fuck you, you crazy bitch. It is not I who is to lay with you. You've been chosen by Dagon, to bear his children. You'll soon be free from the shackles of humanity. You'll be like me. A mother to the deep ones. Don't come near me. Stay back. Petri. What did you do to him? We showed him the light. Come. Come, I'll show you. Fuck you. Alex. Let me show you the way, Alex. Back up! Look upon the light. Back! Careful with my talisman. It's very old, like me. Yeah, and I'll run it through your goddamn heart. I mean it! Look at the light. Keep looking at the light. There's nothing to fear. Look at the light, look at the light. Relax. Relax, child. Yes.
