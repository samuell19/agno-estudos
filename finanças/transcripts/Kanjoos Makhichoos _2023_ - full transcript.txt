I've to use this small incense stick for whole month... and that packet for whole year. Please forgive me! What happened? Why're you being angry in early morning? You save money by extinguishing that incense stick. But you haven? t paid my salary since last two months. What? I should give you work and then I should also pay you! Wow! You used to roam here and there. I gave you a place to stay. I pay for you lodging and food. I also got a book for you to learn English. You got that book from waste. You also take this electricity fuse with you in night. Without a fan, mosquitoes bite me in night. I brought that China fan for you. Where is that? This one! It doesn't give any air. Now you need air too! This is Chinese fan. Hold it and move your head like this. It will give air. Focus on the job now. - Take this, Jamna! Shivhari, have you started distributing posters now? Yes! I wanted to collect some purities by serving society. Give me some more then! I'll also give them to my friends and gather some purities. Okay then! Greetings! - Greetings! Chotu! - Yes, brother! Take them all. We can use them to pack things. "Place me in your heart's mobile... "like a sim, darling." "Place me in you heart's mobile, like a sim, darling." What are you playing? What happened? Play songs according to your age. Try singing some holy songs sometime. These are holy songs of this time. If you want to send a message to God... use mobile instead of a temple... and use hashtag instead of forehead mark. My every holy song is generally... trending in whole Lucknow. I have 10, 000 followers. - Is it? Oh god! I remembered something by this. You all should start following Jamna now. Why? - He went somewhere at 2:30 am in night. What, aunt! You're talking nonsense. - We don't believe you. I swear on Facebook. My account should get hacked if I lie. I've seen him sometimes going out at 2:30 am in night... using torch light. Ganga! Is it some matter of girl? What if he runs away like your brother in law? Oh God! Mom, look what she is saying! Madhuri, you'll also become like me then and be confused... if you're married or a widow. Sister! - What sister? That's why I stay online all the time. If I find your brother in law online some time... I go and poke him so much... that he gets offline permanently. No! Please don't say things like this. Where will I find him online? He always keeps his data turned off. I'll call him and ask about yesterday night. Wait! Don't ask him anything for now. Yes. She is right. No one will ask him anything for now. We'll follow him when he'll go out in night. Look, brother! I am telling you that... if something like this happens... I will beat him so much that... he will throw out everything from mouth. That will hurt him so much, aunt. - Hey! He is calling. I'll ask him now. - Hey! Don't say anything. Hello! - 'What's going on Madhuri? ' You tell me! - 'Listen! ' Don't cook dinner at home tonight. Bring everyone near the old temple. There is a party. What? Really? We have to attend a party! Yes! Listen! Wear old clothes and... don't use makeup. Why? Are we going at a food offering done for dead or a party? The person who is giving a party is a very poor fellow. He might feel bad if we go wearing good clothes there. Oh! Why? What why? You ask so many questions. I feel as if I am sitting in a court when I talk to you. 'Listen to me! Bring two empty tiffing with you. ' Why do you need tiffins? - Again! Why do you behave as Rajat Sharma? Do what I'm saying. I am hanging up. - But... That party? Yes. That party. Go and get my those clothes out. Mr Pandey! - Yes! Wow! You've worn... all the old clothes. Jamna, who is that poor who is giving this party? Here, mom! Here! - What? Will you make us eat in a feast for all? - Yes. Poor and homeless people eat here. Mr Pandey, are we poor and homeless? Everyone is poor in front of God. This poor will save 500 bucks today. Did you get the tiffin? Yes. - Great! Jamna, poor and beggars eat here. We won't eat here. Let's go! Anyone who leaves, will eat offering after my death. Jamna! Let's go! Come! Let's eat 'Halwa-Puri'. My bad luck! What are you doing? Dad, everyone is looking at you. Why are you covering your face? Because of your nonsense. - What are you saying, dad? What else should I say? Your miser attitude has crossed all boundations of shame. Of someone recognizes us eating here, they will look... at us how they look at these poors. Open your mouth, son! Leave all that! Where is tiffin? Excuse me, brother! Listen to me! We have some handicapped people at our home. They couldn't come here. It would be nice of you if you could fill this box for them. Yes. - Fill this up to the brim. - Okay. Thanks a lot! You're really a nice person. Oh God! Arrangements are done for tomorrow's breakfast and food. What are you doing? You know that I get gastric issues when I eat grams. Mom, eat potato. Leave the grams. "Everywhere is just happiness." "Everywhere is just happiness." "Everywhere is just happiness." Oh God! he really left at 2:30 am. Mom! Dad! You son is sleeping alone. My son won't even move until morning. Hide! Hide! Hide! His walking style tells me... that he is definitely hiding something. What if aunt's prediction about a girl comes true? Silent! Let's go and find out. Be careful! Slowly! Hide! This police station is closed since many years. What is he doing here? Has he killed someone? - Hey! He might've hidden the corpse here like a movie. - Shut up! Stop watching movies at Jumri's place. Let's see what he is doing. I didn? t do anything. I am innocent. Mom! - It's not just mom. Your dad is also here. And your son's mom is also here. - yes. Tell us, what are you doing here? So much money! From where did you get this money? Did you steal it? - Did you loot it? No, mom! I did nothing of such sort. I swear... I hid it here to save it from being looted. That's all! Is it? You could've also kept it at bank. - Yes. Dad, how can I trust a bank? What if some Malya comes and steal my money? Tell me whose money is this and how much is this? It's 80, 253 bucks, dad. You've saved 80 thousand and you become a miser even for a penny. I will beat you. - No, dad! I am saying since last 7 years... that the walls have got spots. We need to color them. We need new furniture, new curtains, new floor. And your dad is asking from so long to make a... place for birds outside. You will keep 80, 000 hidden... but you won't fulfill your family's wishes. My sister's son... his name is Satynanad but he studies in Saint Paris. What about or Krish? He studies in Hindi medium Chedilal school. I also want our Krish to study in an English medium school. What happened to all of you? Hindi is our national language, mom. Don't try to make excuses. You have saved so much money but never got a... dress for me. - Mom, she is lying. I got a dress for you six months back. Am I lying? Mom, I'll show you that dress. Why are you fighting at this time in night? Fight will start now, mom. Look at this. It was a bed-sheet sale. He combined three bedsheets to make a... 'Saree' for me. And what did he tell me? Take it, it's a designer 'saree'. It's two in one. You can wear in day and I can use it as a bed-sheet in night. Shut up! Till today... you never got me an apple. Eat according to your standards. You can eat another fruit. All are some. I am not talking about fruit... I am talking about a phone. - Iphone? What can I say, daughter? He was not like this before. He became like this after getting married to you. That's nice. mom! Put all of your son's fault on me. Shut up you both! Won't you tell us now? Why did you save this money? Tell me! I saved it for you and mom. What? Liar! I am not lying, dad. You can hit me if you want. But I am telling truth. I saved this money for both of you so that... I can send you both on a trip to four places of pilgrimages. You don't know this dad, but on the day of my wedding... before going to the marriage place... I heard you talking with grand dad's picture. Dad! I will be free of responsibilities today after marrying my son. I have one regret that... I couldn't send you on trip to four places of pilgrimages. I also want to go but I won't say this to Jamna. Because I know well about the pain of not fulfilling a dad's dream. I just wish that God keeps Jamna and my daughter in law happy. Please bless me, dad! This son felt the pain of a son that day. I also heard my dad's unsaid wish. So... I decided that day that... I would save money and send you both on that trip. And... they say that the one... who get to see four places of pilgrimages in their... life, he gets liberation while living. So, isn't it good to get someone liberation in their life... instead of spending after their death. Stop it now! Will you make me cry? God bless you with all happiness! I did this for you. Did I do something wrong? No, son! You're not wrong. I though that you were Prem Chopra. But you are Neeraj Chopra. Neeraj Chopra! The gold medalist! - Yes! Dad! Get some tea! So, you want to visit 3 - 4 places of pilgrimages? - Yes. It's 4 places of pilgrimages. What's this 3-4 places of pilgrimages? I mean that three of you... want to go to four places of pilgrimages. No! It's not three. Both of them will go. My mom and dad will go. When? As soon as they can go. - What's the issue with that? Next Tuesday, a tour vehicle is leaving. I will book a ticket in urgency. Tuesday is just after five days. That's great. - Okay. Money? - Yes. We have got the money. You don't need to count. Look at this. So much! - Be careful! What's all this? - It's cash. Total 80, 000 in cash. It's my earning of many years that I collected with hard work. Will you send my parents in a helicopter? That's why I am charging 80, 000. Will you send us by a helicopter? Don't get emotional dad. It's just to Kedarnath. I am not buying a helicopter. Give a receipt on uncle? s name. Hello! Book two tickets in urgency. One is for Mr ganga Prasad and one is for...

You can't make it that good. Man, what happened? His parents have gone on a picnic without him for the first time. Such grudging kids should not be brought out of the house. Your dad must be the one who is grudging, you moron! My parents went on a pilgrimage. I'll get you cursed. He is calling me grudging. - That's okay. Dad would have hit him. Listen to me! - Go ahead! Leave this boring Pandey behind and become Chulbul Pandey today. What're you doing? Did you lit a candle? Why at night? It's not a candle. I've put some perfume. Why did you waste perfume? You could've put on new clothes for someone's marriage. Don't convert this romance into mud in this rainy season. Listen to me! - You listen to me! Look at this. I am really worried. Did mom and dad get a lower birth or not? That TC told me that it was hard. Their phone is out of reach. Dad will take care of that. You take care of me. Krish is at lower birth. We are at upper birth. Let's plan for birth of Krish 2. - Krish 2? You will hike my expenses. "My duty, my religion." "You are my everything." "You're a thread, I'm a kite."

' Someone, please tell us something. Tell us! Why are you not answering? How will we know if you don't tell us? - One minute! Please stop! How will I understand if you all shout at a time? Will I be able to tell anything? You took them there. It's your responsibility to find out about their whereabouts. You took them via a helicopter. Can't you go and find them with a helicopter? How can I tell you? Helicopter service is closed. Walk and go then! Have you gone crazy? I am telling you that the way there is closed. I won't be able to do anything now. Army will do everything. Then call army. - What? You must have that vehicle's number in which they went! Call that vehicle's driver. I am unable to connect to anyone. Shall I talk directly to the clouds in Kedarnath now? I am trying to make you understand since last an hour. But no one is listening. Did I ask the cloud to burst? My dad is also trapped there. I am unable to connect to anyone since yesterday. Listen everyone! Uttarakhand Govt. has launched a helpline number on television. They've given the number. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go home and call them. Hello, dad! - 'Tell me!

When will it connect? It's switched off. Jamna, my son! Many sons like you are searching their parents. Whole Kedarnath is destroyed. 23 - 24 villages have been swiped off in flood. We are sitting here. But many have been separated from their family... I am praying that at least... mom and dad stay together. Mom has never gone out of Lucknow alone. 'The number dialed by you is... Enough! I'll go there myself. Where? This helpline is helpless. I'll go to Kedarnath myself. I will search for my mom and dad myself. Wait! I'll search for them. Listen! You can't go further! There is a landslide. All ways are closed. It's not possible to go further. Move back! - What about people who are trapped there? Move back! Move back! 'Angels, where are you? ' 'Why're you far from eyes? ' 'I am anxious and unknown here' 'River streams are calling for banks' 'I am calling you. Please hear me' "Where are you lost?"

' They must've found something about mom and dad. 'Listen! Ask harish to come to Thali society's interchange. ' It'll be helpful if he'll be with me. 'Okay. I am sending him. ' - Okay. Birju, go home! I have to visit a government office. Okay. - Harish is coming with me. Are they your parents? Yes. They are my mom and dad. Ganga Prasad and Saraswati Pandey. - yes. According to the list of tours and travels, they went on... trip to four places of pilgrimages. - Yes. Did you receive any call? - No. Were you able to connect through any other medium? - No. Sir, I went there myself to search for them. I've searched every mountain and camp but they're nowhere. No connection from last 25 days? - No! Not at all! Oh! What can we do now? Fill this form and... sign on it. What kind of form is this? In such situations... when a person is missing since last 25 days... and can't be connected... we should accept that they went to meet God. Government declare them dead. What are you saying? How dare you say that? Who are you to declare them dad? Crazy! Have you gone crazy! - Please be patient. Crazy man! - I am not crazy! How dare you hit me so hard! I am just telling him the rule. I am telling you what my senior asked me to tell. I didn't make this rule in my house. Look here! Look at the policy. Family of the dead person will receive... seven lakhs per death. - What? Man! One dead person will receive 7 lakhs. His both parents are gone, so it will be 14 lakhs. So he will receive a compensation of 14 lakhs. You'll receive 14 lakhs. You didn't listen to me and hit me. 14 lakhs! What? - That's what I said. What are you saying? I am saying that even my parents never hit me so hard. You hit me without any reason. If you want to complain so much... go and complain to the senior officer. What are you trying to show here? Brother! - Hey! I am going home. Let's go! Yes, take him. What are you looking at? Do your work! We have so much work today. I am telling you this as a friend that... you should not hit a government officer like this. Jamna, please try to understand. We should close our doors when 'Laxmi' comes. What are you saying, aunt Jhumari? What Laxmi? They are comparing my parent's life with money. The breaths that I am taking... are given by my parents. My name has their name after it. We break relation with someone only after their last rites. But you want me to do last rites of my learning and take the money. I am really hoping that my parents will come back alive. And they have already decided value of their death. Shall I write dead in front of their name after taking this money? I don't need this kind of money. So what if he is an officer! He can't say whatever he wants! What wrong did he say? It's been 25 days since we have started searching for them. You have also been there. Nothing will happen with our opinion. Govt. have declared the dead on documents. Jamna, accept the truth. If uncle and aunt would have been alive... they would've let us know one or another way. I've also uploaded posts on Facebook and insta. Everyone has started commenting, RIP. Listen, Jamna! Ganga is my Facebook friend. We have chatted on messenger few times. If he would have been alive, he would have replied. There is no reply. So take the money, son. Aunt, how can I take money like this for my parents? Okay then! Don't take the money. Sister in law, make him understand. If he won't take the money, Govt. Officers will take it themselves. No! It would be better if we could fulfill... Ganga and Saraswati's wishes with that money. Take it, brother. Take it as a blessing from your parents. Take it, son. Everyone is saying. So, take it. Yes, son! What should we do now? What are you thinking, Mr Pandey? I don't know Madhuri. What should I do? I have always taken all decisions after consulting my parents. What should I do now? Everyone faces these hard times in their lives when... they have to take decisions on their own. Okay? I understand. But you also know. I only know that you might be a miser but... you spend your feelings with open heart in relationships. All of them think with their mind. But you... you think with your heart. And one thing is decided in life... that nothing is decided. So whatever decision you take... take it with both your heart and mind. 1.25 to color... 45 for furniture... and now the only things left are... a place for birds for dad... that's for 90, 000. Krish's fees and donation... for English medium school... can be given in advance for next three years. Three lakhs. See mom, your wish is fulfilled. Your grand son will study in an English medium school. A 60, 000 apple... for Madhuri. 60, 000! Brother, are you buying lifestyle supply of apples? Apple for 60, 000! You dumb! I am buying an apple iphone for her. Is it? Brother, won't you take anything for yourself? I don't need anything. My parents blessings are enough. Then please get something for me. My blessings are enough for you. Yes, Madhuri! - 'That govt. officer has... come to our home. ' I will come. - 'I will get him some tea. ' Okay! I am coming. Chotu! - Yes! Chotu, look after the shop. I will go to home. A govt. officer has arrived. Give me that, Yadav. Take this, Pandey. Handle you fidelity and... free me from this burden. Take this. I've already counted the notes. You can count them again. They are total 10 lakhs. Ten lakhs? But you told us that it would be 14 lakhs. Sister in law, compensation is of 14 lakhs. But to get this relief fund to you in such a speedy manner... we need to get signature of 25 people. We need other ten thumb prints and... at least ten commendations. But, all of our officers... have come together and... taken this pressure from the Govt. And worked overtime just for you. Obviously, govt. Won't pay for their overtime. Overtime? It's a system. Let me tell you. The money declared by the Govt. First goes to the state. Then it goes to districts. Then it goes to collector office... and then it comes to you finally. Now... money will be spent... for them to sign. Sir! This is a complete fraud. Brother! - Fraud exists because of faith. You've also done fraud for so many years. Your dad paid tax for so many years. It's already been 5 years since your dad retired. Every year after that, you showed loss and never paid tax. You showed loss and didn't pay a single penny towards tax. Think that these 4 lakhs are for that. How do you know all that? - How do I know? Is that the question? The government collects full detail of every person... who receives money from it. Whatever that is! I won't take money like this. - Okay. We will take it that way. We'll also forge your signature. Think about it. You're in loss from all sides. Tell me, what should be done? You can decide. Mr Yadav! - Yes! - Have some tea. Hello! - 'Yes, brother! ' 'I've sent that bird's place. Take the delivery and send money. Send it in cash. - Okay. I am hanging up. Mr Pandy! Color boxes are here and they've sent the bill too. Yadav! Do you have a pen? - No. "Caretaker should never go away." Turn it. "Stars of eyes should never be separated." "My heart isn't convinced. My soul doesn't agree" "Even if all the happiness comes your way." "Your name flows in my veins." "Come back when I call for you, I force you to." "Streams from rivers are calling fro banks." "I am calling for you, please listen." "Where are you lost?" "Lost! Lost! Where are you lost?" "Why are you so angry?" "Why are you so annoyed?" "My world is empty." "Please fill life in me again." "Where are you lost?" "Man, where are you lost?" All of you, please pray that my parents rest in peace. From that 10 lakhs rupees that we received... - 14! That 14 lakhs rupees that we received... only 51, 000 is remaining. I want to donate them in other areas. I want today to be considered as death anniversary... of my parents and a feast for all... is arranged for poors on this day every year. I request you for this. Please take this. Bless us, god! Look at this! I already knew this. What have you done Madhuri? What have I done? - You've left all the lights turned on. It was mom and dad's death anniversary, not 'Diwali'. I turned off all the lights. Since I got you that iphone... your focus is on that, not on the house. I... See Mr Pandey, someone is there in the washroom. After I installed that English toilet seat, all kids use that. Let me take care of them. - Dad! Yes, son! Get your slipper and come. Listen! Whoever that is, please hit slowly. What slowly? Who is there? Hey! You guys are here. From where are you coming? Grandpa! - Dad! The whole society was empty. Where was everyone? Grandma! - Oh, god! That's your mom! Jamna! - Mr Pandey! Mr Pandey! - Dad, what happened? - Wake up! What happened to him? Mr Pandey! Mr Pandey! Madhuri! - Yes. I saw that... Mom! Dad! It's real! It's real! Mom! Where were you, mom? - What happened, son? Dad! - What happened? - Where were you, dad? It's real. Come! Come here and sit. My mom! My dad! Mom! Mom! Mom! Dad! - What happened? Mom! - You're looking at us with your eyes bulging out... as if we are dead and... you're returning from our death anniversary. Grandpa! What are you saying? Why will they do that? Wow! How nice, Jamna! You have got the whole house colored. It's my favourite, blue. - Nice! New curtains! New furniture! My daughter in law has a new iphone. New tiles! How nice! Wow! And who got that bird's place outside? Dad, leave all about that. Tell me, where were you and what happened with you? He went to Guptakashi in your search. But you were nowhere to be found. What should I tell you, son? It was all fucked up. What? What is fucked up? Situations were playing with us. Dad, it's an English slang. Everyone speak like this in our English medium school. When did you start sending him to an English medium school? Dad, leave all about that. You are not telling me... what happened with you? What happened was that... flood came after that. It was water all around us. We both were hanging on a tree. And after that... you remember that Suzee! - Yes. He saw that she was drowning in the water. He didn't think and jumped in the water. What are you saying? After that? - I jumped in the water... but I remembered after that I didn't know how to swim. - Shit! What did you do after that? I kept on hanging on that tree. Mom! - What about you, dad? I should be thankful to Suzee that... she pulled me towards the bank and saved me too. Everything got back to normal after four days. Four days? Were you both separated? - Yes! - Yes, son! We were separated. They took us to Rishikesh then. Then I started searching for him. I lost my senses. He was nowhere to be found. I was also searching for... Sareswati in Rishikesh. I was searching for Saraswati from one to another camp. I searched for him for 14 days. But your mom was nowhere to be found. I started feeling scared... What if I lost him? Then I went to another camp one day. I sat there for food and saw... that they were serving gram curry. I started missing your mom. Where would she be? How would she be? And suddenly... Saraswati! Like this, Ganga and Saraswati met again. And today, by god's grace... all Ganga, Jamna and Saraswati are together again. Isn't it? This was our story, bro! Why are you looking up and down? I was thinking that so much happened but why didn? t you call me? How could I call you? Both of your contact numbers were in the phone. Phone was in the box. The box swept away in water. You disconnected landlines long back. No one in neighbourhood have that. So it will be impossible to contact. What do you know? I mean... - But why are you speaking English so much? English... - Son, those 4 foreigners left... and left their souvenir. Go and sleep. You can continue in morning. Okay. Man! It's not fart, it's just a burp. Dad, go and sleep. Mom, you should also sleep. You're so tired. I'll wash them. Go and sleep. Get up! Go and sleep. Good night, mom! - Okay. Close all the windows and doors. There are too many mosquitoes. Turn on the fan. - Okay, son. Don't worry about electricity bill. I will pay it. And if someone sees, they will put me in the jail. Are you thinking the same what I am thinking? I can't think what to think about. I don't know... if I should laugh that mom and dad are alive or... should I cry that they are back. I am only worried about one thing now. That is... how to tell them that they're dead for the world? What! What are you talking? We both are dead. Yes! - You signed for 14 and got only 10. It wasn't like that but it was like that. Govt's all work is bullish. You... Please don't talk so loudly. - I'm not talking loudly. Don't start your English engine. You're not getting it. Madhuri, you were there. Tell them! What are you thinking? If mom and dad are alive, who were those crows that... eat all the pudding after performing last rites? My mind is frozen and you're worrying about pudding. Mom and dad! Please try to understand. Don't go out from the house. Keep all windows and doors closed. What are you saying? If someone sees you... I won't be able to show my face to anyone. - Calm down! Dad, you should calm down. Calm down! - Please speak slowly. I am saying you! Shut up! That's why I never used to come out. I think that there is only one way out. - What? "You use lipstick..." "The whole district moves." "You look most beautiful in the whole district." How are you, Mr Choubey? Mr Yadav! - Hello! Don't be like this. I am Jamna Prasad. I hit you by mistake that day. You can hit me if you want. Leave me! Leave me! What do you want now? We've given you the money. - I have even spent that. Are you here to get invoice? - I'm not here to get invoice. Listen to me! You gave me that money because my parents died. Why are you wasting my time? I am not wasting time. You think that... What should I think and why should I think? Think that... I am only thinking one thing while looking at you... what to think? No! I am going to tell you what to think. Think that... if my mom and dad... becomes alive, then? - Alive? No! You mean... are they really alive? Tell me, yes or no? Yes! Oh! But I took the money... and they came back after that. So I got confused. But what I am saying now is that... if I return the whole amount... will this matter be settled? But you just told me that you spent the whole money. Yes, I have spent that. Oh! - Why are you getting scared? What I am saying is... if I somehow... arrange the money by selling the house or... some other way... will this matter be settled? Mr Chaturvedi will tell about that. Then call Mr Chaturvedi. You're not getting it. - Listen, Mr Yadav. Where are you going? Let's talk to Mr Chaturvedi and sort out the matter. How can we meet him now? Mr Chaturvedi has gone to Agra since last week... to get operated for piles. He will come after 2-3 days. Listen! Take my advise and... keep your parents inside the house. Don't let them get out. No one should know that they are alive. Listen! You should also get isolated for 2-3 days. I'll become late in getting money if I isolate myself. How will I arrange the money? Mr Yadav! Mr Yadav, where are you? Mr Yadav! He didn't reply straightforward... and then he went missing like Mr India. Looks like he is scared after listening about mom and dad. Mr Chaturvedi is already scared. He is getting operated for piles. Once he comes back... Jamna Prasad Pandey! Sister in law, tell me what you want to see? I just wanted to return this phone. Tell me how much will I get? You'll get 10k for this. 10 from 60? We only bought it before 4 days. It doesn't have any resell value. And since you've used it, it's second hand now. How is that? Brother, it's... Assume sister in law dies... - What? I only asked you to assume. You'll be second hand item... for the next one. No one will give you your cover price now. Are you crazy? Is there no difference between a human and phone? It is. Mobiles are more costly that human today. Don't try to be over smart. Let's go! He has gone crazy. What? In between the year, we don't take any admissions. Yet you insisted on... your dead father's wish. So we gave him admission in the middle of the year. Now you want me to talk... and fight with trustees to give your fees back. How is that possible, Mr Jamna Jamna Prasad Pandey? Madam! What is she saying? How would I know? - You don't know! Why did I give you that English book then? Brother, I haven't studied till that chapter. Dad, she is saying that... fees won't be returned. Let's get out from here. - Exactly! You want to sell these benches back! You'll be cursed by your parents. Okay. Leave these benches here. But take that bird's place back. Brother, how can that bird's place be taken back on which... pigeons have pooped to their heart's content? Why are you pooping more than a pigeon? That kid is right. I won't take anything back. - Go away! - hey! He asked me to leave and left himself. Child? You are a black spot. I will make you lick that bird's place now. All of the money is spent. There is nothing! Nothing! No one is ready to return a single rupee. I told you before to not take that money. But no one listened to me at that point. They asked me to take it as... the money was mom and dad's right. That is also right. Jhumri aunt asked me to fulfill mom and dad's wishes with that... and I did that. I painted the whole house, fulfilled their wishes. I put that bird's place there. People dry their clothes on that and... dog pees near that. I put benches in the part with your name. I thought that... elders would come, sit there and I would feel good. No one sits on that. People sit behind them and make out. Dad, does that mean kissing? Hey, shut up you English medium! I paid his whole fees for that English medium school. Dad, mom's apple phone. - Yes, apple! Apple's phone which went from 60 to 10. I went into minus because of that iphone. Cool down! Cool down, Jamna! - Leave it! What cool down? Why are you taking releasing frustration on daughter in law? Have that officer done something in your bum? In what? - In your bum. Bum! - Bum! Dad, in Hindi, bum is what we blast on Diwali. In English, this is called bum. Hey Krish, take this and go inside. It's better that I go outside and play. You are so boring. Look! Since he is going to that school, he is behaving like this. He wasn't like that before. I don't know who cursed me. I know. You ate food of 5 poors in that feast for all. That was 10. He also got food packed for 5 people. Yes. You remember all these things really well. And I am the bad one. I have done everything. I made a mistake even by taking birth. Stop talking nonsense with family. What home? I can't even take a loan on this. Grandpa already took a loan on it in you marriage. I found this information after my marriage. You have done fraud with me by hiding this. Fraud! What about the fraud your parents did with me? They told me that girl was like a cow... would always stay on a picket. No one told me that picket would be hammered in me and... I would have to bear everything. Oh God! Have you gone crazy? - Madhuri! How can you say anything you like? Think how will you return that money to that officer. That's what I am thinking. - Think about that only. What should I think? How will I get those 10 Lakhs? There is only one way, Jamna. Saraswati Worship items shop! I've only gathered this much in my life. I was thinking that... - Nothing is greater than parents. I have learnt this from you. Take a loan on the shop and return the money. And will you tell my parents? - No, I won't. And... Sorry! For what? I forced you to get me that apple iphone. Woah! - Mr Pandey! Discount on a bier? I can't do that. Please try to understand. Please give me a discount. You can cut the bier and... the money will reduce. What happened? Brother, he wants to get a discount on a bier. What should I do if his father was only 4 feet tall? A bier is a bier. Look, I can't give you a discount. Give him the bier. - What? Yes! Give it to him free of cost. And you should also be careful. Get a checkup done on your father before his last rites. What if he wakes up on the bier! What are you saying? You won't get it. Take it and go. - Okay. Brother, give me the bier. What's the matter, brother? You gave the bier free of cost! Incense stick is also lit. The fan is also turned on. Is your health okay? Chotu, turn on the fan. - It's already turned on. Then increase its speed. It can't move faster than this. You have done some setting in the switch board. Mr Chaturvedi! Mr Chaturvedi, greetings! Greetings! Sit down! - No, sir! You should sit down. Sit! Yes. Chotu, listen! Go and get special tea for sir. Brother, shall I get some for us too? Yes. Do that. Okay. Sir, how was your operation? Did you face any pain? Listen, you will face the pain now. But people around should feel that we're chatting happily. Talking about operation, you'll be operated now. You ate money from govt's relief fund. You declared your living parents dead. How great! You tried to fool the government. How great! Laugh! No, sir! It's nothing like that. - It is exactly like that. You have done a fraud. You have to face a police case now. Police case? Police case! Police case! I want to make you understand something. Go ahead! I told Mr Yadav that I would return the money. I would take a loan on the shop and return your money. I would pay the remaining amount in installments. Will that work? No! It won't. If you return the money, I would have to return my job too. So leave this honesty aside. What do you mean? - I mean, instead of pointing finger towards me... put that finger on your mouth and go on silent mode. Or else I would gift this bier material of yours... in your last rites. Mr Yadav, let's go! Let's go! Brother, did the guests left? What about this tea? Add some poison in it and drink it... and give some to me too. Open the closed doors, Ganga. Open the closed doors. There was a time when Jamna used to go out at 2:30 in night. And I have to go out today. It's good that the society sleeps at 11:00 pm. Let's take fresh air, Ganga. Let's take fresh air. Jhumari, my favourite sister, missing you abuses. And you drunkard! You're having fun in this bird's place that is on my name. Hey Birju, you asshole! How many times have I told you to not pee on the way. If I catch you next time, I will not leave that thing to catch. Ghost of Ganga uncle! Ghost of Ganga uncle! Oh shit! - Ghost of Ganga uncle! Ghost! Ghost of Ganga uncle! Ghost of Ganga uncle! People, I saw a ghost. Ghost of Ganga uncle! Mr Pandey! Mr Pandey! Mr Pandey! - I am innocent, your honor! I don't know anything. - Mr Pandey! What happened? What happened to you? - Something is going on outside. Let's go and see! - What! What happened now? Ghost! Ghost of Ganga uncle! - Oh shit! Oh shit! Why is so much noise outside? - I went outside... and Birju saw me. What? - He was peeing. I couldn't control myself and I shouted at him. What now? - He has created the problem and I would sort it out. Move aside. Go and hide. Come with me. Go! What happened? Why are you shouting? Why is this drunkard shouting? What happened Birju? Ghost of Ganga uncle! What? - I was peeing near that bush. He came and shouted at me as usual. He told me that he would cut... What? You? - No, that! What are you saying? Shut up! You have created ruckus. Jamna, Birju just saw Ganga's ghost. Dad's ghost! What are you saying, aunt? Don't listen to this drunkard. Hey drunkard, dink less from now on. I am telling the truth. - Shut up, you drunkard. I will beat you so hard... that you'll loose your consciousness. Yes. - No, listen to me. A person always speaks truth when intoxicated. Ganga's soul must be roaming here. Ganga! Ganga! Come here! Give me a signal. Mom, it's me. I was just giving you some support. Hey! Who gives support like this? I would have died just now. He is crazy. Leave it. - No! Look! Look! Some of Ganga's wishes must be incomplete. That's why he is roaming here and giving a signal. We don't even get phone's signal here... and you're talking about dad's signal. Let's go! Leave all that. - Aunt... if you have some doubt, we'll go and meet the priest tomorrow. Yes. We'll call the priest tomorrow. For now... everyone go their houses and sleep. Let's go! Let's go! Come, uncle! Everyone, move! Sleep is really important. Leave me! Is anyone there? Mom, no one is here. Come fast. - Let's go! Curtain! - Let's go! Take me to that side. But Mr Pandey is there. Go to this side and finish your program. Okay. - Come! Madhuri, get me shampoo. - I'll get it. Close the door. Oh God! We have to do so much for this. Madhuri! Aunt! How are you coming from this side? From where else will I enter then? You've closed the front door. And you haven't opened your windows since many days. You've also put curtain on the door. Is there some secret mission? - No, aunt. We'll do nothing without telling you. But... why are you here? - I came to take a bath. What? You! Aunt is here to take a bath. Why are you shouting? Listen, take bath at Birju's place. Why? Why would I go to Birju's place. It's my brother Ganga's house. I'll take bath and wash clothes here. But... that... - Hey! Why is this door not opening, Madhuri? Is there someone inside? That's what I was saying. This is jammed because of rain. How will it not open? I've seen CID's Daya breaking doors in one motion. I will open it. - No, aunt. I'll not let you break this door. I'll never let you. - Aunt, what happened? This door is jammed. It's not opening. How is it not opening? It was working fine in the morning. Yes. But it's not opening now. Shall I call a carpenter? Why are you putting more expenses on me? Push it and the door will open. - Okay. No, aunt. You won't touch it. Move back. Mr Pandey, please try to understand. What understand? The carpenter will charge a lot. Don't touch it. Push it with your shoulder. Okay. - No Mr Pandey! - Push it. Mr Pandey! - Yeah! Stop, Mr Pandey! - Yeah! What happened? Saraswati's ghost! Mom was inside! - That's what I was trying to tell you. What? I am not Saraswati! I am not Saraswati! I am not! I am not! Move back! Mom, are you alright? It's hurting. It's not ghost, Jhumari aunt. It's my mom. She is alive. Me too! Oh God! Ghost! Hey! You are alive! - So what? What could I do, uncle? My life has been ruined since that night. I can't go and pee in night time. I take people with me in day time when I go to pee. I remembered the whole prayer against ghosts. How will I use it now? I used to get scared with every gust of wind. All of us were sleeping with lemons and knives under our pillows. Bastard! What did you say? - Aunt! I can't use slang in front of everyone. But I heard a slang. - Take it as a slang only. Tell me, why didn't you tell us? That Govt. officer asked me not to tell. He threatened me. He asked me to let mom and dad stay declared dead and... keep them locked in the house. What could I do? Jamna, this is wrong. Govt. should solve our problem, not increase it. Tell me! - We should revert back in Govt's language. We should send a notice. - Notice? He is saying the truth. Send the notice, son. Harish! - Yes, brother! If you feel that my matter will be noticed because of sending a... notice, then send the notice. Okay, brother. I'll do that. Send it today itself. Hail to God! Sir! Sir! Jamna Prasad has sent a notice. Notice? - Yes. He has also sent a letter mentioning that... if you get loose motion after seeing the notice, take this tablet. This Ganga Prasad has gone crazy! What should I do with this tablet? Where is Krish? - He is playing outside. Why is he playing? Doesn't he has school tomorrow? - He'll come. Ganga Prasad pandey! Yes! What's your problem? You'll play notice notice with me now! Hey! - What did you think? Your notice would scare me! You moron! - What are you doing? Sister in law, move aside! Move! Move! What? Do you have dirt filled in your mind? Your intentions are dirty. - Is it? We wanted to return the money respectfully. - Return the money? Okay. Yadav! - Yes. - Give him the refund form and... take 14 lakhs back. - Okay, sir. 14 lakhs? Why? I only received 10 lakhs. But it's written 14 lakhs on the paper which you signed. You will have to return it now. You're really a worst kind of human being. Look! You gave me 10 lakhs and... I will only return 10 lakhs. You must declare my mom and dad... alive on the record. - As if! Uncle! When God was giving brains, did you send him somewhere else? You are alive and well. What's the problem if you stay dead on a small piece of paper? By the way, uncle, what's your age? I am 65 and she is 62. - 60. How funny! You don't leave your youth even in the age of retirement. And your son has retired even in his youth. Make him understand. Listen, there is no guarantee that the matter will be sorted... after returning the money. Why? Ask me why? Many high rank Govt. Officers are involved in this. Did you get it? If you tried to act smart now, I swear to God... I would press the trigger on your brain. Mr Chaturvedi! Please keep your gun down. Sister in law, try to make him understand. Ask him to take the notice back. Okay. - Simple! Good. Uncle, tell him to understand. Or else I am telling you that... your shoulders are not strong enough to hold your son? s bier. What? I will take my leave now. Let's go! We'll eat ice-cream on the way. They's blown my mind. Listen buddies, I though a lot. I've decided that it would only... be good if we leave this place. Let's go to Rishikesh. You should come and meet us there. Listen, we will leave but what if... someone else from Lucknow, other than people from this society... comes there and catches us? I'll grow my beard and... you can get a bald head. - What? I will get a bald head and... you can grow the beard. - What nonsense are you saying? Hey, it is all fucked up in mind. How will you pay 14 lakhs, Jamna? Why did we come back? It would've been better if we would have drowned. Dad, what are you saying? - He is right. Why should our son pay the price of us being alive? Where will you run from your family? And running like this is not a solution. Daughter in law - Madhuri is right. It's not the time to run, it's time to fight. I may be high school drop out, but I know that... a spring jump as high as much you push it down. And this Chaturvedi has pushed me enough. He must've fooled the world but never touched a miser's pocket. He is asking for 14 lakhs! That too from me! He must not know my reputation, dad. I became a bit charitable and he made my life a charity. I bent a bit with politeness... and he hit me in the back. Watch now, dad. If I don't make him remember his ancestors for 14 lakhs... I won't be true to may name, miser Jamna Prasad Pandey. Harish, I need some press. But you press you clothes by putting them under the mattress. Are you dumb? I am talking about media, reporters. Son, why're you talking to the wrong person? Talk to me. All press reporters follow me. Tell me what you want. I'll DM everyone right away. Okay aunt, call everyone. And watch! This Chaturvedi became a brute and put his gun on my head. I will become an innocent person... and shoot him without a gun. Shoot! "Power drum..." No, Mr Yadav! - Greetings from my side. Mr Chaturvedi, greetings! Hey, what are you doing here? Come down! I'll tell you. I've brought the whole party here. Looks like he didn't get it yesterday. Come fast! You should also come fast. Greetings sir! I am from Swadesh news channel! I am from "My news". From 'Your news' - From 'Everyone's news'. What are you doing here? - To take you news. What news? - That... In Kedarnath's floods... my mom and dad died. He didn't give me any compensation for that. When I asked for it, he declined me. He gives money to everyone, but scolds me when I ask for it. What nonsense are you talking! You took 14 lakhs rupees and signed on the paper for it. Yadav, go and get that paper. Jamna, you may face jail if they find the paper. They won't find it. Stay at back. Why did you turn off the light? So that CCTV doesn't work. - Wow! You're drunkard but you've used you mind perfectly. Hey! I got it! I got it! Who? - The paper! - You got it! Everyone is shouting that Chaturvedi is a thief. Sachin Tendulakr played well... and Chaturvedi ate money well. Wait! The paper will be here. - Sir! The paper is not there in the file. No paper? - Paper is not there. Where is the paper? Answer me. Yadav! - Where is that paper? I don't know - He is taking my anger out on a poor man. - Shut up! Shut Up! I will prove that this... Jamna Prasad is a fraud. And watch when everything gets clear. Hey! Police! Go in both the directions. You should stand outside. - Okay, sir. Let's go! Come! Come! Is this Jamna Prasad Pandey's house? Yes. Call him! Why? - Call him first. Mr Pandey! Tell me! - Police is here. Who is there? Police! What happened, sir? Police has never come to our house. We've search warrant for your house and society. Search warrant? They'll search our house. I know that. But why? Search everything in their house... and society. Go! Sir! - Mr Pandey, hold this. Today's latest news is that... Jamna Prasad Pandey's parents are alive. What? - And they are also ashamed. Because their son has declared them dead... and have taken 14 lakhs from Govt. He wants to take 14 lakhs again by hiding them. Is this true? - Yes, it's true. He wants to play free fire by keeping gun on my shoulder. Look! Look at his face. Everything will be revealed soon. It is true that the paper... signed by him has gone missing. But his dead parents will come out alive now. What are you saying? You've to give a statement. Sir, why are you doing all this? Please come inside. We'll sit and talk. That time is over now. I'll make you pay by standing here... that too in front of media. Hey, Ganga! Where did you go after living your sister alone? Take me with you! - Don't say like this, aunt. Take the person who picked up the picture. Run along! He is calling me aunt. Wow! A picture is also placed here. Their pics are in your notebooks, on bedsheets and pillows and... even on the walls. Tea? - A photo on the cup! Parents's blessings should be everywhere. Isn't it? - A photo in reverse! We really miss them a lot. Sir, both of them have become ghost. If you want to see, get drunk and come to pee there at 2:30 am. You'll see them. - Go away. Sir! We've searched the whole house. No one is there. His parents are nowhere to be found in the whole society. Their pictures are everywhere. What? We've also checked the booking lists of buses and railway station. We've also sent their picture everywhere. All CCTV footage since yesterday night have been checked. But their parents are nowhere to be found. I'll be back. No! Are you satisfied now? Did you find my parents? Have you got the truth exposed now? All of you saw that... he got such a huge police force. They could've caught some criminals now. He wasted their time, wasted your time. Ask him, what else does he want? What do you want? Ask him! Sir, tell us! Answer us! Close it! Close the door! Sir won't talk to media. Come! - Yadav, this matter has backfired on us. This media will won't let me live now. I will handle that. I am here. Move back! Move back! Sorry! - Why are you shouting? Sir, I can't understand that... his parents were neither on bus stop nor on railway station... nor on any toll nor in their society. Where did he hide his parents? Oh God! Hello! - Greetings, sir! How did you reach here? - Just like that. They are here since morning. They told me that they're your relatives from far. I asked them to call you. But they wanted to give you a surprise. - Surprise! Sir, your wife makes delicious food. Marvelous! How did you reach here? I brought them here. You! - Greetings! Awesome! This is called having a light in your hand in the dark night. What are you saying? I mean you searched for my parents everywhere... but not in your own home. So the latest news is that... Mr Alok Chaturvedi... kidnapped my parents to... eat my 14 lakhs and... locked them in his house. Let me make a video. - Hey! Don't do that. I am locked here, my son. Mr Chaturvedi hit us so much that my back is swollen. He didn't even give us anything to eat. Son, empty stomach gets gas problem. Good shot! Mr Chaturvedi! Think what I can do with you... with this recording. Dad! I'll take my leave. Live long! I'll rake my leave, mom. - Okay. Don't worry about us. We'll eat and have fun. We've given the menu for this week to daughter in law. And we are already dead on the records. So it's Govt's responsibility to keep us alive. That's all. - Hey! Will these old hags stay here now? - Yes. Yes! Hey, Jamna! What drama is this? - Why are you getting angry? "It's just the beginning of love. Are you already crying?" "Just watch what happens next!" Close your mouth or a fly will enter. That... that... That... this... Half of the weight is of peel and seed in a fruit. I don't know why do they charge so much. Dad is calling at such late night. Dad, is everything alright? Jamna, some minister gave a call to Chaturvedi. He became so tensed. A minister? Dad, I am bit scared now. What's this matter with a minister? Minister has asked Chaturvedi to come and meet him tomorrow. He should be scared. Why are you worried? You just keep you spirits up. Don't worry! I'll keep fighting even if I'm scared. Awesome! That's great! Very good, son! But, what happened? Dad, I am hanging up the call. Why do you disturb me while I am talking? Ask me now. - I'll ask to dad. Chaturvedi! - Greetings, sir! Look here! - Yes, sir! Fight between the Govt. And a common man! - Yes. Take this. - Yes, sir! Look here! Who is honest and who is a liar? And look at this! Here. Did Govt. really eat a common man's lakhs of money? What's all this, Chaturvedi? Sir! Since how many years are you doing a Govt. job? Many years. How many times will I tell you one thing? Govt. schemes are like a pumpkin. If a pumpkin is cut, it's shared among all. Who was supposed to keep persons like Jamna Prasad away? It was me. - Okay. Get one thing straight. - Yes, sir! You won't even know when... your bum can be divided in two parts. - Sir! Yes. If this news gets out from Lucknow... we all will face the consequences. And this will start from you. This fat that you've gathered by licking cream... will go away within a day like this. - Sir! Get one thing straight. - Yes, sir! Search that Jamna Prasad... as soon as you can. Who is responsible for searching for him? Mine. - Okay. Go away fast. Fast! - Yes, sir! Oh man! This Jamna is really a deep person. I'll sort him out tonight after calling him to Bablu's restaurant. They are drinking alcohol and have guns too. Hey Uncle... you're having a lot of fun. Does your machine still works? Hey, mind your own business. Beauties are dancing here. I read in newspaper that this place is famous for encounter. Here, people die... even before 11:00 pm. Chaturvedi is here. Mom, are you ready? - Don't worry Harish. I'll kill him if needed. Hey, Jamna! Keep your phone turned on. I am listening and recording everything. Okay, aunt. Don't worry! I also don't want to stretch this matter. I'll clear the matter by offering him to pay 10 lakhs. I am pulling out the earphone. My phone is still on. Let him take the gun out. I'll handle everything. You? - Yes. Greetings, Mr Chaturvedi! Greetings! Greetings! Listen, whatever happened is in the past. I don't want to drag this matter more. - Okay. Tell him. We also want to sort this out in 14. You are saying the same thing again. It can't be done in 14. What about 28? I am saying no for 14 and... you're telling me the table of 14. It can't be done in 28. Listen! Don't try to jump high. Or else my boss will give such a shock that you'll be done for. Let's take a mid way. Let's settle it in 50. How much? - 50! 50 lakh? - Yes. Have you gone crazy? Listen, I can't sell my house. If I'll sell my shop, myself and even Chotu, I'll get 10 lakhs. How will I pay 50 lakhs. You're crazy. Let's go, Chotu! Did you miss some injection in childhood or are you dumb by birth? We're not talking about receiving, we're talking about giving. We're talking about giving 50 lakhs. You want to give that money to me! Yes! - Chotu, sit! Take 50 lakhs and settle the matter. We'll handle the Lucknow press. Get rid of your parents' weight from my chest and... go away from Lucknow with your family. Come after 3 days and collect the money. Okay! Yadav! Brother! Chotu, tweak me. Hey! Was he telling the truth? - Yes! He will give me money. Hey Harish, he will give me money. Aunt, he is talking about paying me. Let's go! 50 lakhs! Yes! - Will they pay us? Yes! Think about number of zeros in 50 lakhs. How will I know? Total six. - Six. Mr Pandey! We got such a sweet surprise. Thank god! - 50 lakhs! Now, not only Ganga and Saraswati... I can also go on a world tour. - Yes. I'll also pay your salary. He was talking about gun! What happened, brother? Why are you staring at me? I thought that you were out to hunt the system. But I can see that you've been hunted down by the system. No worries! May God brings you all the happiness! Hey! Hey, brother! Listen to me! What do you mean? Dad, is my decision correct? You are absolutely correct, my son. Son, always remember on thing. Like how winds change direction, of weathers... blessings change moments of hardships. Go! Just screw him! That's all! Okay, dad! I'll pull his screws well. Okay, we're hanging up. Hey, Madhuri! I am feeling a bit confident now. Madhuri! Hey! Why are you sad now? I've talked to dad. He also thinks that what I'm doing is right. What you're doing is absolutely right. And I like all of your miser moments. But my heart doesn't stop from... beating for you and worrying about you. You just have to keep your back strong because... praises and cheating, both are given behind the back. Mrs Madhuri Pandey... you have said a heavy line... but its' actually correct. When I felt that my parents were not there with me anymore... I started feeling really alone. But when you held my hand at that time... I understood that... I would never be alone in my all life. You may only be my wife for world... but you are my life. You're like a small machine gun. And till I have this machine-gun with me... I can shoot all of my enemies. You must stay strong or else I won't be able to stand. Dad, stop romancing and do some work. You have to do blast like a bomb. You wait and watch! Your dad will make a blast and scare others now. My social media queen, are you ready? Yes! ready! - Let's go then! Lights! Camera! - One second! Don? t say action. - What happened? Do I look good? All the best, Mr Pandey! Action! - Daughter in law... you didn't give us catchup too. There is also no sugar in it. Hey, Mr Pandey! Stop having this breakfast. Your son will come now. I'll throw this 50 lakhs on his face. We will be strangers then. Pack your luggage now. - Our son won't come. Why? - Hold this. Looks like you didn't scroll any social media since morning... or else you would have found the reason behind it. My son has also put you in hashtages. Watch! Watch! Watch! Greetings! My name is Jamna Prasad Pandey. On video has really become famous... on social media since last evening... on instagram and Facebook page of Jhumari Lakhveer. Lucknow's Jamna Prasad Pandey has directly... attached the current Govt. Everyone knows that corruption is injustice. But some... Govt. officers have made this injustice as a source of income. Isn't he Jamna Prasad panday? - Yes! There are some officers in this system... who have ruined the reputation of whole system. I request you all to support me. So that I can fight against these officers. People are really angry. People are demonstrating at many places in the country for this. This matter is spreading like a fire. The Central minister has also made a special committee for this. Alok Chaturvedi and Jamna Prasad Pandey will be presented before... this committee on Monday... and truth of this matter will be revealed. Today, Jamna Prasad Pandey and Alok Chaturvedi have reached... to the office of Fraud Committee. Along with the minister from ministry of Home Affairs... officers from National Disaster management are also here. Let's go inside and watch what's happening. Mr Chaturvedi! All the best! Jamna Prasad Pandey! Greetings! You are saying that Chaturvedi offered you 50 lakhs. - Yes. He asked to get the matter sorted. - yes. 50 Lakhs? - Total 50 lakhs. My face also became like yours after hearing that. I also started killing my honesty inside after hearing that. But by God's grace... Mr. Jagat Narayan came and met me at that moment. He changed my decision. Who is Jagat Narayan? He is also a fraud victim like me. My son, daughter in law and grand son, all swept away in flood. They told me that I would get 21 lakhs. I thought that my son made arrangements for my old age... even with his death. But what did I get? 7 lakhs instead of 21 lakhs. I had thought that I would save 21 lakhs in bank and... my old age would go smoothly with the interest money. But I didn't get anything. Nothing! But that's alright, my son. I am happy that you will be able to change... your old age with 50 lakhs. His tears worked as a support to my stumbling honesty. I thought that... my 14 became 10, his 21 became 7. There must be many others whose money was taken by Govt. My society gang started working on this. Then I found that... 3700 people died in this tragedy. My calculator started going wrong... with the calculations I was doing... about the money taken from all people. My mind blew away. Because it's a fraud of almost 150 - 200 crores. Lucknow is just a small part. So many such officers in all cities have taken so much money. This made me feel so bad. Then I made that video. You know the result of everything that happened later on. One more thing, sir! Harish! - Yes, brother! What is this? Applications... from all these peoples... whose money was grabbed by Govt. Have you become everyone's contractor? No, sir! I have only taken contract for my parents. Sir, I am really an ill fated son... because when my parents return back alive... I became tensed instead of becoming happy. I am a bier merchant. But they became merchants of dead. They made a sale of family emotions with... last rites of parents and children. But I still want to thank Mr Chaturvedi. Because if he hadn't troubled a miser like me for 14... how would I have revealed his deeds? Mr, Chaturvedi, thank you! But you took me as a weakling. I am a middle class man from Uttar Pradesh and... I am also a 'Brahamin'. We follow religion and work, and play with frauds like you. Mom and dad, please stand up once. Aunt, sit down! Why are you confusing us? Sir, these are my mom and dad. Ganga Prasad Pandey was a teacher in school. My mom... what they call it these days... she was and is a home maker. Both of them are my life. I never grew a Neem tree in my house. Because parents' shade is enough to protect from any sunlight. I only want that 'late' gets removed... from my mom and dad's names... and they become alive again in Govt. Documents. Saraswati, did you see that? People give birth to their kids. But our son is giving birth to us. Love you, son! Rock-star! Rock-star! Love you, Mr Pandey! Sir! My dad only taught me one thing... that you can eat one morsel of food less... but never keep someone's borrowed money. So I want to return the money that... I got from the Govt. I only want some time for that. People who were cheated... should get their money back. This Jamna Prasad Pandey, Ganga Prasad Pandey... is only requesting for that. Honest Jamna Prasad Pandey has made his dead parents alive... in front of whole country and... he has made corrupt officers feel ashamed. - Govt. is... - taking legal actions against... all officers who have been caught in compensation fraud. People are getting their full amounts back which was taken. There is an ambiance of happiness in whole country because... this is not just a win of a common man like Jamna Prasad Pandey... it's win of whole country. You're in a good mood, Mr Pandey. But why are we going towards that closed police station? I am taking you to show it, why must I waste time in telling you? What? - It's a surprise. Great! Look at this? - What is this? So much money? - Yes! It's total 11, 000 rupees. I saved 11, 000 rupees... from that 10 lakhs I got. What can I do? I am miser by blood. I will pay my first installment with this. Only 9 lakhs, 89K will remain. How great, Mr Pandey! I am very proud of you. Why're you pressing it? It's finished. Grandma, it can still be used for more seven days. Listen, I have taken a bath. There is some water in the tub, use it for cleaning. - Okay. Where did you go? I went to market. I got 10 ladyfingers. I'll add two potatoes and make curry for us. Wow! - We'll eat remaining in the evening. Very good! And we'll pay everything to Govt. Like this. All of you, come here. After listening to all pf you... I feel like crying. - Why? My whole family has become misers now. Don't call that. It's called miser! What do you mean? Hi-five!
