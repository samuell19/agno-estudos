I was way too sloppy and they hated me. Is that what they said, that they hated you? They didn't have to. Then you don't know what they were thinking. Look, no matter what happens, you got really close. Little better? It's just so frustrating. It would be better if they rejected me day one. Otherwise I get my hopes up on these callbacks and... It was dumb to think I had a shot. That is not true. You know what the real problem is? I spent all last week writing a term paper. When I should've been rehearsing. I'm not gonna be a geologist. I don't have a passion for rocks. Don't start this again, Emma. You know the rules. You live in my house, you go to school. What if I just take a semester or two off and focus. Absolutely not. I don't want you limiting yourself. Because you think things will be easier. How is following my dreams limiting myself? Aren't you the one who told me to do that? [scoffs] honey, you can dance and go to school. It's not one or the other. I'm not saying I wanna give up on school forever. I'm just I'm just saying I wanna take a year off and focus on my career. What career? I meant... You don't believe in me. Emma... Just say it. Of course I believe in you. I just want you to take advantage. Of all the opportunities that you have. As long as you approve of them. I didn't have half the options that you have, honey. College was not an option for me. And I regret that every day because life was so much harder. Especially when your father left. When I finally had a chance to go back to school. It was practically impossible. Sometimes I would just, I would cry on my drive home because I was so tired. And then I had to come home and try to parent. I'm sorry I was such a burden. You know that's not what I meant. Honey, look at me. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. Always. [dance music] ♪ [indistinct conversation] ♪ ♪ What? [machine trills] - Yeah, sorry man. - It's not working. You've gotta be kidding. Here. Try this one.

Well a couple of my credit cards seem to be having an issue. Um... Did you guys get a fraud alert or something like that? Nope. Nothing like that. So, do you know what's going on? I've tried every card. I really can't deal with this right now, rick. Figure it out. Alright. I'm sorry, dad. I... I don't mean to call so late. Um... How's everything going for you otherwise? Let's talk tomorrow, rick. [keypad beeps] - Um... - [call disconnects] So... It's four days a week. Mmhmm. And it's gonna take up a lot of time. Hmm. I have to withdraw from school for this semester. Emma... It's just one semester. This is what I wanna do with my life. It's all I've ever wanted to do. Why can't you understand that? I'm sorry, but no. As long as you live in this house you have to go to school. That's the deal. So... Let's figure out a way that you can do both. - Fine, you're right. - I don't have to be here then. Emma. I can stay with Katy until I can get my own place. - On your barista money? - Do you know how much rent costs? I'll figure it out. Honey, I know this is the most important thing to you right now. But you can't make it the only thing. It might be difficult to strike the balance between the two. But I know that you can do it. You are so talented and so smart... Then why don't you trust me to make my own decisions? [ominous music] - Hey! Hi. - Hi. Welcome to your new home. Oh, thanks babe. Temporary home, I'll be out of your hair. As soon as I can find my own place. - Are you kidding me? - It's gonna be so fun. You should just stay forever. Oh, you'll get sick of me eventually. Yeah, maybe but I think it'll be good for you. Spread your wings a little bit. - Hi rick. - Hey Katy. - Hello. - Hi. This is Emma. She's gonna be staying with me for a little bit. It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you too. So what are you guys doing this weekend? - Oh, uh... I don't know. - It all depends. Well I just talked with a few friends. About taking my dad's boat out this weekend and, uh... You both should totally come. Oh. Yeah, that sounds like fun. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. See you guys. His dad owns the whole building. Oh. - Yeah, he's totally loaded. - Well, his family is loaded. Sounds nice. Yeah, I saw a picture of the boat. Uh... It's more like a ship. You mean like a yacht? Oh... Yeah. That's definitely what I meant. Wow. I think he likes you. Oh, shut up.

Dad, you can't do this to me. - I can do whatever I want. - It's my money. - What am I supposed to do? - I mean, I can't just... What, what, what? I can't... Can't get a job, I can't be stable. I can't... Oh look, Linda. Little ricky's gonna cry because he's not getting what he wants. My son. Unable to stand on his own two feet. I'm glad your mother isn't here to see what you turned into.

You squander every poss... Oh yeah? Yeah, I didn't think so. Weakling. [yells] [thud] [panting] Dad? No, no, no. Oh. It was an accident, Linda. Okay. Wait Linda. Give me your phone. It was an accident, I swear. We need to call... Give me. No, give me your phone. - Linda. Wait. - Stop. Give me your phone. Stop it! [both grunting] Linda! Stop it! Come here. [suspenseful music] Linda! Linda! Hey! [knocking on door] Linda. We have to get him to the hospital. Let me in. My stepson just attacked my husband. I think... I think he's dead. There's blood everywhere. You need to come quick. Send someone now, please. Please. Oh, my god. [dramatic music] [crying] I'm so sorry, dad. [phone vibrates] [keyboard clacking] [groaning] [panting] [ominous music] Come on. Come on. Hello neighbor. Hi. Uh... Emma, right? - Uh, hi. - Hi. Listen, I'm so sorry to ask you this. But I'm running late to a flight. And my ride share just cancelled on me. Is there any way that you could take me to the airport? Uh I'd be happy to pay you and everything. It's just, it's a bit of an emergency. - Uh... No, no it's okay. - I'm not busy right now. Really? - Yeah, get in. - Awesome. Wow. Thank you so much. I mean, you really are such a help. - Happy to do it. - I could use someone to talk to. Well, happy to talk. [police sirens] [dramatic music] You need to get out of here now. I wonder what that was all about. Guess we'll never know. [ominous music] It's a mess. Yup. All amateur hour. So you don't think he meant to kill dear old dad? It feels spur of the moment but intentional. Stepmom said as much. Hmm? They were cutting him off, out of the will. Things escalated from there. Come with me. This would've been hard to break down. But not that hard. He could've gotten in if he wanted. Lucky for her. He probably heard her calling the police. And that's when he decided to run. He still had time to break into the safe. I didn't say he was a boy scout, And whatever he is, he doesn't have a plan. That makes it easier on us. [dramatic music] [keyboard clacking] [sighs] Boyfriend trouble? [laughs] no. He'd have to exist to give me trouble. So... Is that so? Yeah, it's my mom. She's probably hoping that I'll beg to come home. What does that mean? Um... She gave me an ultimatum. I don't think she expected me to take her up on it. Over what? I got a part in a show. Oh, you're an actress. Uh, no. I'm a dancer. Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, you got a great body and you're in great shape, so... [chuckles] I mean, you know I mean... Not like I've been looking, it's just... Anyways I had to take a break from school and she wasn't having it. So you left. So I left. Wow. What? It's just really impressive. I mean, clearly you believe in yourself. Um... Yeah. I do. I didn't always, but... What changed? Uh, I put in the work every day whether I felt like it or not. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was not always easy. Like today. My mom helped me a lot too. I mean, she probably regrets that now. I don't know. I think that sometimes our parents are fearful. That we'll make the same mistakes that they did. So they... They push us to do something safe but boring. And sometimes we push back or we fall in line. But I think the question is, Figuring out whether you're gonna be a person. Who's gonna fall in line or not. Emm? Emm, are you home? That's weird. [keypad clacking] Where are you? Huh. [chuckles] [keypad clacking] [sighs] You're very popular. Oh, it's just Katy. Oh. So, uh... What about you? [chuckles] what about me? Uh, what do you wanna be when you grow up? [chuckles] I don't know. Uh I used to wanna be a pilot when I was younger, but... Colorblind? No, not colorblind. It, uh... Just wasn't in the cards. Why not? Well, my dad... He used to say to me, Son... We sit in the back of jets, we don't fly them. End of story. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, he wanted me to fall in line. Become a lawyer like his dad and himself. Well, when I showed no interest in that he, uh... He stopped being a dad. So. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. - Oh, no. No, no, no. - It's totally fine. I just... I don't usually talk about this stuff but, uh I'm glad you asked. We're almost there. Do you know what terminal we're going to? Uh... Yeah, just, uh, let me I need to look up the reservation real quick. [phone ringing] Everything alright? - Rick? - Huh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Just give me a second to [voice on phone] I don't know what happened, And to be honest, I don't care. I never liked that man, don't know what my sister saw in him. But listen to me. The police are looking for you everywhere. So consider your next move very wisely. Just be careful. Uh, did you find out the terminal we're...? We need to leave. What? Uh, we... We can't be here right now. Uh... What are you talking about? Look, I can't get on a friggin' plane right now. Okay? I just... I need you to drive us out of here. Now. - Now! - Yeah. Okay. [suspenseful music] Wait, what are you doing? Look, I don't know what your deal is. Or what's going on with you. But I think you need to get out and call a taxi or something. When you figure out what it is you wanna do. Look, I'm really sorry that I yelled at you. I am. I don't know what happened. Maybe I think I had a panic attack or something. I'm telling you I want you out of my car. If I could just have a moment to kinda... No. Come on. You can't just abandon me in a random parking lot. I can't help you. Stop. Don't! Let go of me! No. Don't. Stop. Stop! - [yells] - let go! Okay! Now listen. I don't wanna hurt you. Okay? I... I don't wanna do anything to you. But you gotta promise me that you'll do everything. That I ask you to from here on out. Okay? [breathing shakily] okay. [phone vibrating] I won't. Okay. Let's go. [car engine starts] [sentimental music] - [voicemail] hey, it's Emma. - Leave a message or don't. Bye. - Emma. - I know you're still mad at me. And you don't wanna talk but, uh... We don't have to speak if you're not ready. But I need to know where you are and that you're safe. Alright? Text me back. I love you. [phone beeps] [phone dialing] - [voicemail] hey, it's Emma. - Leave a message or don't. Bye. [phone beeps] [speaking Spanish] Mommy loves you too, baby. Alright. Bye-bye. [phone beeps] You'd think he could afford a maid service. Looks like he didn't take much. No. He wouldn't. Trying to leave as quickly as he can. Where would he go? An airport? Family yacht? A friend? Does a guy like this seem like he has friends he can turn to? Okay. Let's take this back, see if we can't get in. Let's go interview the neighbors. [dramatic music] Would you stop doing that? What? Stop looking at me. Here. Just listen to the radio or something. - [reporter on radio] - still following. This developing story. Prominent attorney Charles frye was found dead in his home. In bay palms estates today, murdered in a brutal fashion. The police aren't providing any details. Saying that they are still in an initial stage. Of their investigation. But knz reporter Tamara lap in sky tells us. That when she visited the crime scene, She talked to a neighbor who claims to have seen. Frye's eldest son Richard, or rick as he's known, Fleeing from the home after having heard. What he describes as a loud disturbance. [sniffing] I won't tell anyone what happened. I swear. I... I don't care what you did. I don't care about the cops, I just don't... Please. You know, you can take the car. I won't say anything. I can't risk that. - I swear to god. - You know, I won't. No, no, no, no. Look, alright, this is not a negotiation. They're gonna be looking for someone traveling solo. Okay? So I need you with me for now at least. Here, take the highway. [knocking] Miss more no. Hi Katy. Is Emma home? No. Um, she should be back soon though. So she is staying here? Yeah. Do you know when she'll be back? Um I don't wanna convince her of anything, I just wanna talk. - Um... - She should be back already. Do you know where she went? She took my friend to the airport. But that was a while ago now. [clears throat] Excuse me, ladies. Do you live here? I do. - Have you, um... - Have you seen this man today? Um. I'm sorry. I didn't plan on any of this, you know. [sighs] I wouldn't have taken you if I'd had any other options. You hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Look, I just need to get to the border. If you get me to the border I swear I will not hurt you. How can I trust you? Well, it doesn't look like. You have too many other options, does it? I'm sorry. I promise. Okay? I'm not... I'm not a monster. Uh... I just need to get outta here. [car screeches] Whoa... Steady. I'm just checking the gas. Easy. Are you hungry? Pull over at that rest stop and, uh... We'll get something and, uh... I'll fill up on gas. Okay. How long has she been out of the house? Two days. Okay. Any contact with her? Idea where she might be? No. We had a disagreement and she left. I tried texting and calling and she hasn't responded. Probably still mad at me. Do you have access to her social media? Maybe she's posted something. Geolocations, that kind of thing. She hasn't posted anything. Do you have any way of monitoring her spending? Maybe she charged a credit card somewhere this morning. I checked already. Okay. What about, uh... Her phone. Is her phone on your account? Do you have one of those “find my device” apps? Yes, I do. Okay. Let's start there. Okay. Let's just look over here. Alright. Take these. Let's go. ♪ [ominous music] I know you must hate me. Well, the good news is, Once we get to the border you'll never see me again. No one will. It's gonna be hard. What? Leaving everything behind. It's not like I have any other choice. - Did he, uh... - Did he deserve it? Your dad. I mean, no. Look... I would never. I just lost control. I just figured it didn't happen for no reason. - My dad, I mean, he... - He always hated me. [chuckles] When my mom was alive he would pretend. That he could tolerate me. Well, once mom died he, uh... Stopped pretending. So... But, uh... I always knew. You know? Even when I was little. But none of that matters. Yeah. I understand. You understand? Yeah. I do. Did you know your dad? I'm sorry. I don't mean to press. He didn't, um... He didn't stick around long enough for me. To get to know him. You know, or for him to want to know me. I don't know what's worse. A dad who is there but doesn't care. Or one who doesn't care enough to stick around. But, um. I don't think he treated my mom very nice anyway. So... You know... Alright. It's okay, we don't need to talk about this. It's okay, I don't mind. Let's close the door. Hey, uh... Can we switch for a while? I just... I'm losing focus. And I don't think this is gonna cut it. Yeah, okay. Ah... Go the other way. You know, it's still very early ms. Moreno, And we have a good lead. This is it. I'll find security footage. Ramirez? Hey. Okay, okay, okay. It's hers. Alright.

I can keep driving. You honestly think that I still trust you? Take the exit. Are you sure you're gonna be okay on your own? Mmhmm. Yeah. Mmhmm. If anything comes up, call me immediately, No matter how small. I will. - Okay. - I will. I'm gonna find your daughter, Hillary. Thank you. Get some rest and we'll talk first thing in the morning.

The suspect is armed and dangerous and has a hostage. Do not approach until we get there. You know, according to regulations, I'm supposed to take you back to the local precinct. So you can wait for updates. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't think so. - [police radio] - attention all units. The suspect is at the star lane lodge on sunrise avenue.

Uh... Continental breakfast is only on the weekends now, sir. Sorry. [laughs] only on the weekends. Terribly sorry. Uh... Could you just give us a couple muffins or something? We could really use it. Well that's very unfortunate because I don't have the key. To the pantry so I can't help you. Does... Does someone have a key? I mean, anybody have a key to the pantry? They come in on the weekends. Ah. Makes sense. Um... Are you sure that you can't find an extra key. Just to help out a couple of your special customers? All of our customers are special, sir. So if you're feeling groggy, why don't you pick up that cash. And go on over and have some complimentary coffee. You should get that cleaned. [ominous music] [coffee pouring] Alright. Drink up. We got a long road ahead of us. Let's go. Come on. - Wait! - Yeah? - I apologize. - I was rude earlier. Uh... Let me get you a free breakfast. Yeah right. I actually do have the key to the pantry so wait here, Let me just go get a couple of muffins. Stay right here. For the road. No thanks. Let's go. Come on. Did you say something to her? What? No. Then what the hell was that about? You were standing right next to me, I didn't say anything. Sir! Just let me put something together really quick. We're not interested. But it'll just... I... Get the hell away from us! [gasps] [car engine starts] - [operator] 911. - What's your emergency? Um... Yes, I'm at the star lane lodge on sunrise. And I'm calling to report, like, a domestic violence. It could even be a kidnapping, I don't know. [tires squeal] No, no, no! Oh my god! Oh my god! What are you doing? - [operator] hello? Ma'am? - Are you still there? [police sirens] [groaning] What was that nosy bitch doing?! I don't know, I told you. What did you say to her?! Nothing! It doesn't matter now. You almost killed her! Would you stop that?! [breathing heavily] She saw the license plate. No way, you almost ran her over. I have to get another car. [gasping] Think, think, think. Think, think, think. Think, think, think. Oh god. Come on, come on, come on. I need to dump this car. [tires squealing] - She wasn't hurt. - She was just scared. After they took off, which direction did they go? North. Really? Yeah, north. Thanks for trying to help. He's zig-zagging. Is that bad? No. [chuckles] It means he doesn't know what he's doing. That's good for us. If he wanted to hurt your daughter. He would've done it already. Why doesn't he just let her go? Okay. I was chasing this murderer once. And he was a really bad dude, he did things to people... Uh... He ransacks a house after a spree. Ends up stealing a cat. [chuckles] Why would you steal a cat? I don't know. Neither did he. He takes this cat with him across three states. Do you know how we caught him? He kept stopping to steal cat food. An 80-year-old security guard at a pet shop takes down his. License plate and description for shoplifting salmon in a can. We had him an hour later. Some people, once they're in a storm, They just keep sailing right on into the waves. They can't help themselves. A lot of them, They're not monsters, they're just... Screw-ups. Do you have kids, detective? Call me Lisa. Do you have kids, Lisa? - Yeah, a little girl. - She's seven. Would you rather that screw-up. Ran away with your little girl or your cat? The last thing I wanna do is make light of this. We're gonna get your daughter back. I promise you. Let's move. What are we gonna do, walk? We're gonna find another car. [fabric rips] [dramatic music] Give me your wrists. Do it! Come on. You're gonna March me around with my hands tied up? That's a great way to call attention to yourself. Ah! Wrap my hand. Just use that, go on. Come here. Argh! Over there, let's go. Come on. Call out to her. No. - Pretend like we're stranded. - I'm not joking! Go. Excuse me? Excuse me, ma'am. Our car is dead and we don't have aaa. - I'm sorry, honey. - I can't help you. That's it. Come here. Give me your car. What are you doing?! Get in. Move over. Stay there. - Wait! - Back up! I'll do it. [car engine starts] [tires squealing] [phone vibrating] Hello? Yeah, okay. What road was that? Copy. They found them? We're closing in. [indistinct conversation] She said... It's getting a little more clear already. That's good. Blood. - Okay. - Emma was definitely with him. Hillary? Hey. Hillary, Hillary! Whoa. Hillary. Okay. Okay. They're close. - Huh? - They're close. Graves. Get someone on this car and I want us all to fan out. I need every motel, convenience store, clothing store. And abandoned building in this area covered. You got it? Hillary, come on. Come with me. Are you kidding me? Nope. Yeah. Okay. I'll coordinate it with local police. And we're checking all local businesses. He left everything in the car. Okay. And one of them is injured. They'll need new clothes and medical supplies. Copy. [phone beeps] - What are you doing? - Come on, get changed. Are you gonna watch me? I don't care if you put it over your clothes, just do it. Wig too. Excuse me. Come on. - Have you seen this man? - Yes. What? Shh. Come here. In the back. Thank you. We have a possible sighting of the suspect. - [door shuts] - rick! [car engine starts] Hey! Stop! Ma'am, I let him slip through my fingers. It's alright. But they... They must be headed towards route 73. Okay. Okay. They can't get far now so get in touch with the troopers, Tell them to block all the route exits. We'll close the noose around him. Alright. [engine revving] We're gonna get him. I think we're good for now at least. Just stop. [chuckles] Are you stupid? They're gonna catch us eventually. How long do you think you can keep almost getting away? That woman is gonna call. And report this car stolen any minute now. And you think this is gonna throw us off their track? Look... They will kill me where I stand if I stop now. And that was clean back there. And I'll find us a new car soon enough. This isn't you. You think you know me? I think I've gotten to know a little bit about you. [laughing] Then who am I then?! Huh?! I know that killing your dad was an accident. And you didn't want to kidnap me. And you obviously don't wanna die. And you can end this now. See? You don't know me. [suspenseful music] Was that them? Oh no, no! Just pull over. Rick. [engine revving] [tires squealing] No, no, no, no, no! [tires squealing] [grunting] Where are they going? [tires squealing] Go, go, go! Left, left, left! Hold on, Hillary. Rick. Rick, rick, stop! Stop! - Are you crazy? - Ahhhhh!!!!! No! [air hissing] Argh! No, no, no! [dramatic music] Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Hey! Emma! Hey! [grunts] - [operator] 911. - What's your emergency? [grunts] I was kidnapped yesterday and, uh I'm on the side of the road. We... We were on route 73. [operator] okay. Where on 73, ma'am? Uh... I don't know. [operator] is there a landmark around you that you could use. To help me locate you? Ma'am? Emma! That's the car. - Whoa! Hold up! - Wait, wait, wait! That's the way. Emma. You can't hide forever, Emma. It's awfully quiet out here. [sobbing sounds] Really? You're gonna make this that easy on me. [sobbing sounds] [thud] [grunts] come here! [both grunting] [dramatic music heightens] Stop! Get off! - Rick. Freeze! - Lower your weapon, rick. Get back! I said get back, lady! I mean it! [Emma crying] Please don't hurt her. Hillary. What, you don't care about her. - Emma is all I care about. - You don't wanna hurt her. You guys make an awful lot of assumptions about me. You know that? - You're right. - No one was listening to you. Right? To what you wanted, what you needed. No one gave a damn about me. Nobody! That must've been awful. It's terrible not to feel heard, listened to. [crying] mom, mom, mom. It's not too late, rick. I think it is. No, it isn't. Alright? You have a chance to not make this any worse. You don't have to do this. You don't wanna hurt her, rick. I didn't... I. I didn't mean for this to happen. You made a terrible mistake. You don't have to keep fighting though. Just let my daughter go. Let her go. [crying] oh, my god. Drop the knife. It's over. It's over.
