THE FAMILY AND AN EXTRA ONE Do you remember them? This was the big family. A family whose feeding required a lot of arithmetic and overtime. But they coped with all the problems because they were always like this, in this photo, very close. Some years went by and some of them are not around anymore. Grandpa is missing, who went fishing one day and a double pneumonia took him to heaven. He modestly called it "a cold". The mother is also missing. She passed away, but she left someone else in the family. It was to be called Jesus, but, as it was a girl, she was named María. Today she's crying her eyes out because no one pays her any attention. But today is a very important day for the whole family. And your father? Where's your father? - Your father... - Get in and I'll take you to hospital. Very funny. Where's your father? Probably in the office. What's wrong with this beautiful baby? Why is she crying? Come on, cute little thing. Tell your sister, who loves you so much. Give her a lollipop and see if she calms down. Go with Chencho and blow the horn. - It's my horn! - Chencho, don't be grumpy. ... Russian try and now it's Emiliano who counterattacks - and scores wonderfully. - Lifts, scores. Turn it up, Juanito. I can't hear it. - Spain has sped up its rhythm. - And what about me? - Phillip IV. - Phillip IV succeeded Phillip III in 1621. He moved his court from Valladolid to Madrid and appointed Count Duke of Olivares as his favorite. I don't know what that is. Mrs. Consuelo, what is a favorite? - Somebody who does favors. - Another present! I bet it's a lamp. It will be the 15th lamp. Let's see who sends it. - Now. - She doesn't stop moving. I figured it. From the Martínez. How cheeky! They're probably broke after buying this rubbish! I think it's very nice. It's awful and indecent. God knows who that woman is - She's Paulina Bonaparte. - Bona what? Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister. She was the model for Canova's Venus. A model? The things they teach at school nowadays... Hurry up or she'll get away! - Red Crow never fails. - Now! Críspulo! You, brute! Vandal! When your dad comes I'm gonna tell him. Here we are. Leave the horn alone. Get down! - Horn mine. - Come on, Chencho! You're such an ass! Why don't you let her blow the horn? Poor thing, I'll give you supper in a second. - Sabina, come over with me. - I'm studying. Come over or the girl won't eat a thing. Let her listen to the radio! Do what your sister says. And why won't she eat unless I play the guitar? - Because she likes flamenco. - Please be quiet, I can't hear a thing. Hello? It's you. Yeah, I'll get her on the phone. Mercedes, it's your bugging boyfriend! Hi, love! Yes, your mother's here. Alright, but hurry up. - Who was that? - Your brother in law. Why are you staying at home all afternoon? You haven't noticed until now? Yes, that's why I ask. Are you sick? I'm waiting for a long-distance call. Yeah, Piluca's. You still got that fever? Piluca? Don't be ridiculous! That's over. It's something much more important, but I'm not telling you anything. I won't be able to live with that suspense. - Who's in there? - Me. - What are you doing? - I'm doing myself up. Come out now! When I'm finished. How annoying, they don't leave you alone! That's right, see how my baby eats! Another one for you. That's right. That's right. And another one for you. - Okay, that's it! - More, more! My fingers are hurting. Play, otherwise they won't eat and dad will tell us off. What a drag! Okay. Here is a spoonful for you. That's right. Another one for you. Another one for you. - Hi, godparents! - Hi, Pedro! Where's the family? - Here we go again! - Críspulo, it's our godfather. - We thought you were the janitor. - Red Crow apologize. Red Crow is being a pain this afternoon. Godfather's here! - Go on and laugh! - He didn't do it on purpose. Hello, my dear ones! Candy? Candy after that arrow prank? - Don't be like that. - I'd rather give you a... Don't tease them. - Very nervous? - Shaking like jelly. That's normal. We all go through the same. Hi! - Thanks for the fridge, it's beautiful. - And very big! Last model, with a double freezing system and a silent operation! - You are so good! - Where are the girls? - Dining in the kitchen. - I'm going to see them. Let me take off my coat, you savages! Later! Where is your father? - We'd like to know it. - Hasn't he arrived yet? No, he hasn't and we don't know anything about him - since 15:00. - He must be in the Ministry. In the Ministry... He's probably celebrating with his buddies. What are you looking for? The engine is there. - Nothing's fallen down! - My glasses. - Are these ones? - Look! Thank you! What shall we do now? - I have to go to the mountains. - And I have to go home. It's not the same. If I'm the last to get there I'll have to pay for everybody's gin. - You can't drive me there, can you? - Me? Of course not. With that heap of scrap we wouldn't get there until Monday. That's for sure, because if the road gets steep... it won't even move. - Then do something! - Yes. I will write it down for the insurance company. If I can... but I can't. Take these. See if mine do. - Oh, so you too... - Yes, sir. Me too, but I don't need them. I have them because they look nice. I see. Now I know why you didn't see the car. - What do you mean? - That you look very nice with them on. I didn't know older could be so tricky. Maybe you caused the accident on purpose to see if you could hit on some girl. Well, not with me. I'm old enough. Yes, you're 18 at least. 19, so you could almost be my father. Skip the "almost", have a daughter of your age. - You're kidding me! - And 15 more of all sizes. What about grandchildren? Don't you have any? Not yet, but... Well, that's it. I admit you're very original, but you won't put me on. Let's see the registration number of your car. Speak louder, please. Will you please be quiet? Then it's 8000 plus allowances. And the trips, of course. I'll go and see you tomorrow. Well, the day after tomorrow. Yes sir, 12 o'clock, thank you very much. Sister, today is a great day! Hurray! Kill the paleface! Finish him off! - What the? - Good night, dad. - Hello, dad. - We're playing with godfather. Can't you play without making such a racket? Godfather buffalo. And you should behave yourself, they are only children but you... Well, if you enjoy that go on, go on. Then the neighbors have good reason to complain! - Hi, family! - Hi, dad. - Hi, dad. - Hi, dad. And about time too! It seems nobody is getting married here. Well, somebody is: My son. And he's going to have the most beautiful bride in the world. - Aren't you boy? - I'm a lucky man. - Don't doubt it. - Daddy, up. What's the little one doing here? - My dolly, my treasure. - Daddy, TV. - How is it rated? - I didn't notice. - Adults only, dad. - Very nice, and the girl is watching an adults only? And you? - Are you over 18? - Not yet. All right then, the show is over. Come on, we won't know who the murderer is. The gardener, as usual. You go to bed. Let's go to bed and have some rest... We have to talk. We've been after you all afternoon. I guess you settled the car business. - Yes, madam. I took it to the garage. - To the garage? I don't suppose you want us to go to church in that jalopy. Dad, godfather. Yes, love. Acting like a hooligan. Another present, Mr. Carlos. You get a lot of the aforementioned, - if you'll excuse the metamorphosis. - Did they give you a tip? The usual and meager one, madam. Did you hire an orchestra? - Yes, madam. - And the carpet? - That's out of fashion. - Having some fun... Listen, you didn't answer to the orchestra thing! And the carpet! Answer me, please! Oh my god! I'm going nuts! - Shall we scalp him? - He doesn't have any hair. Godfather buffalo. Let go of me, barbarians! Savages! Let go of me! We have to torture him first! Let's get the torches and the firewood! Pretty little angels... Let go of me, darlings. I'll give you sweets and chocolates, whatever you want. Don't be afraid. In the end the federals will arrive save Buffalo Bill. Fine, I hope they do. Where are the federals? - Right, see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow, godmother. - Hi, Paula. - I'll take her to bed. - But you were just visiting! - We are family anyway. Let her, daddy. She has no practice, but then she'll learn. - Did you have a good supper? - Yes, dad. They both dined to my music. I'm worn out. - Now let's pray, my beauty? - No, but give me a comic. Tomorrow. Now you have to pray. My dear Jesus... I want a comic. If you're not good I'll go home. - My dear Jesus... - Right. You're a child like me. - Sit down here. - I'm not going anywhere. - You'd make such a good mother! - I'd love to be one! But life is unfair. You have so many and I... I would be happy with just one doll like this. - Something's burning! - Help! - I'm coming! - They want to burn me to a cinder! Do you mean to burn the house down? What an ordeal! But there's no danger. I have a bucket full of water ready. And I know the fire department number by heart. It's your fault for bringing the feathers and the arrows. It's that child's and Bonanza's fault. They tell me "to close my eyes and open the mouth,", and they fill it with shavings and gag me. - These children of yours... - They need a firm hand. If they were with me... Good idea. I'll send them to you when they are on holiday. But what's this? We nearly have roasted godfather for lunch. - What a shame! - Supper, supper, supper! Mi coat, Paula. Stay a while so we'll be able to talk peacefully. Peacefully? Who says these monsters - are not going to poison me? - You're not having dinner? I'll have dinner at my own place. Me too, pretty godfather. No way! You stay here with the tribe! Godfather buffalo! Very nice! That's good! You can laugh! Don't get mad. You come home with us - and stay the night. - No, Paula. - Your husband is right. - Of course! Besides, I don't like them to sleep out. Do you think we're taking him to a pigsty? Now we're taking him with us. - That's it! The coat! - Pretty godfather. Take me with you too. It's best if we don't see each other for a while. Good night! - Godfather! What a surprise! - A kiss, daddy. Behave yourself and remember to pray for mummy, grandpa, - and all your brothers and sisters. - Sure! And also for Auntie Enriqueta and uncle Eduardo and the janitor and the Teddy bear, and we pray the whole night away. - Alright, let's go! - You're leaving so soon? - Yes. - Bye. Why are you so late? Mr. Ramón is a pain in the neck. In the last minute insisted on dictating some letters in English, which I can't stand. Then I won't pay me overtime! What a slave driver! You should see how he went when I told him that I'm going to a wedding tomorrow. Did I received any letters today? - No. - 9 days already! He's going to get it! Okay, let's go and have dinner. Madam. Can you tell me when we'll be able to talk? Because you look very calm, but I'm very nervous. - Calm down future mother-in-law. - Don't call me that! Tomorrow everything will be fine. The bouquet! Who's got the bride's bouquet? - They'll bring it tomorrow at 9. - The soup! Behave yourselves, children. - Where are we going to sleep? - You in your place and I in mine. We'll have to move him, because there's no room. Don't touch him! Godfather. Godfather! What do you want? We've already prayed for everyone, even the Flintstones and the yoghurt girl. I want some custard. - What does he say? - He wants some custard. No, you've already eaten a lot. Now good little Chencho is going to sleep. - I want some custard. - No custard! Just sleep! Don't make him cry! And now it's my fault! - Godfather buffalo. - You little... Come on, he doesn't know what he's saying. He doesn't? What do you want, son? Custard! Godfather buffalo! He couldn't make it clearer, "buffalo"! Calm down. Your godmother will give you more custard, but just a little bit. - Godfather! - What? Tell me a story. Let's see. Once upon a time there was a very, very big dwarf. And a very, very small giant. And as the dwarf was so big and the giant was so small, nobody knew who the dwarf was, if the big, big one or the small, small one... There's no milk. - A miracle! He's fallen asleep! - Thank goodness. - Custard! - He's out of control tonight! - And what shall we do? - I'll take charge of this! You're gonna go to sleep at once because there's no milk and so there's no custard, understand? Paula, custard! I told you there's no milk. Then go to the dairy and milk a cow. That's nonsense. - Don't you hear him? Go to the dairy! - Go there yourself if you want to! Do you think that a serious man like me can milk a cow? That's women's stuff! But I don't know how to... so that... Then learn how to! Go, please. He's gonna wake up the neighbors! Me? No way! What shall I bring with me, a jar or a bucket? Dad, are you gonna stay up working tonight again? No, I'll finish in a minute. Why don't you go to bed? I want to leave all the shirts ironed. Luisita is not very good at it. - Now she'll have to learn. - Besides, I couldn't sleep. You have to rest so you can look beautiful tomorrow, although that won't take you any effort. I prefer to stay here with you. It's... It's the last night I'm going to spend here at home. Come on, you're not going to the end of the world. You're getting married and that's very important. We're gonna miss you a lot... All of us. - Dad! - Come on, love. Crying is not allowed in this house. You can't imagine how often I remember mom. I'm getting married and she's not here. We could have made her so happy! Now I really miss her. - Don't I look nice in it? - What a crazy idea! What are you doing? Take it off! It brings bad luck. That's if you had put it on. Dad, do you think I'll ever get married? I'm so short. - Do you want to leave me too? - No, we'll live here. - There's no room here. - We'll pull down some walls. There's plenty of time. Jorge still has five subjects to pass... and he might just be flunked. Take my dress off or you'll make a mess of it. Come on! - Who can it be this late? - Another present. Godfather! I come to give you this lunatic back. What are you doing here at 2 in the morning, you poor wretch. That's it, poor wretch. You just said it. Here. You keep him for good. What an ordeal he's put us through! Don't shout or you'll wake him up! He's asleep. Carlos, I swear that when I rang the bell he was wide awake. He's a cynic! I'll take him to bed, dad. Aren't you going to say anything to me? I thought it was the other one who was getting married. No, man. This is the one who's getting married. How can they be so late? Maybe they went to the wrong church. - Calm down, mom. - Alright. - Look, there they come! - There they are! What was that? - Of course, it had to be you! - It's your fault. - You didn't use your indicator. - Hey you, lady! No, don't bother, it's our fault. Of course it's your fault, like last night. Your glasses. Wear your glasses! How cheeky to get married at his age! He looks like her father! He is her father, and mine, and all those guys. Mercedes Alonso Cebrián, do you take Alberto Muñoz Aguilar as your lawful husband following the teachings of the Holy Roman Catholic Church? Yes, I do. Do you accept to be his faithful wife? Yes, I do. Do you accept him as your husband? Yes, I do. Alberto Muñoz Aguilar, do you take Mercedes Alonso Cebrián as your lawful wife, following the teachings of the Holy Roman - Catholic Church? - Yes, I do. Do you accept to be her faithful husband? Yes, I do. Do you accept her as your wife? - Yes, I do. - Hold your hands. On behalf of God Almighty and blessed Saint Peter, Saint Paul and the Holy Church I declare you husband and wife in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit Amen Come on, dad. Dance with the bride! Other than paso doble I'm pretty useless at dancing. - Come on! - Go out and dance! - Are you happy? - As much as you are. I'd like to be as happy as you and mom were. - And also have so many children? - Maybe it's hereditary! You two should leave in a while, with no farewells. There're too many people and you mustn't miss the train. It's a trip you only take once in a lifetime. Weddings always move me. - Do you remember ours? - How could I forget it! Those damn shoes, my feet are still killing me! You just remember the shoes? Nobody asks us to dance. That's because all the boys are very old. What a waste of a day! - What are you looking at? - Look at that chick! - Here's some ice-cream. - Bring champagne! Later... This ice-cream delicious! So much that I ate it up without realizing. Nothing compares to Majorcan buns! I went to Palma de Majorca on my honeymoon. Yeah, Majorca is a very nice place but... very humid... and very cold... This year we'll sure win the basketball championship. - What sport do you do? - Me? Gum chewing. That's why we always do so badly in the Olympic Games. Forget about the Olympic Games and move on. Hey, what would happen if we put a firecracker in there? That even the waiters would eat some cake. Mercedes! - Are you leaving already? - Yes, but don't say anything. If my mother sees us leaving she'll start crying again... Have fun. Look after dad. Now he needs you more than ever. You gotta be the woman of the house. You know, little salt in his meals. Salt's not good for him. And don't put butter on his toasts. If he doesn't see it he doesn't ask for it. And don't tease him, right? - Come on! - Bye! Write soon. - A double brandy. - Right, sir. What are you doing here? Why aren't you dancing? - There are a lot of pretty girls around. - I'm not in the mood. What's up? Are you okay? Dad, I want to talk to you man to man. - Your brandy, sir. - You're wrong! This is not my order. I asked for a lemonade. Take it. If we're gonna talk man to man you might need it. Well, what is it you have to say? I think you're right. I'm not good at studying. I do my best, but it just doesn't get into my head. I've thought that... it would be best if I started to work. Doing what? There's a factory of farm machinery that needs traveling salesmen. At least those three subjects I passed will be good for something. They pay 8.000 pesetas plus allowances! I see. Of course, I'll carry on studying if you want me to, but it'll be no use. I won't get my degree. I don't wanna be a failure, nor that you spend more money on me. It's about time we helped you a little. Let me help you, dad! - When are you starting? - Then can I accept the job? You've already done, haven't you? Now it's I who needs a brandy? Can I invite you? What happened? We're having fun, but I miss you a lot. Kisses for everybody from Mercedes and Alberto. Hey, I'm here! - Still working? - I have no choice! Leave it for tomorrow. You've already earned your wages. Majorca? This is what you need. A good holiday. Holidays! You know what I have at home? Yes, 16 kids. Well, now they're 15. 14, Carlitos has left too. He's started to work. Good boy! At this rate they'll soon leave you alone. I'm afraid so. Then it'll really be very sad to go home. I enjoy a lot getting there and finding them all together screaming, breaking things, making noises. I couldn't stand an empty house. What you need is a woman. You're still young. - I'm already 46, Julia. - 47, don't be so vain. - How do you know? - Remember, I manage the staff files. I know a lot about you, more than you can imagine. 47 is quite an age. It doesn't show on you. You're very good looking. There are many in department who would like to keep like you do. - Take Mr. Conesa. - Where to? I mean as an example. He's just 32 and there's no comparison. And what do you say about Mr. Cifuentes. Right, come on, I'll drive you home. You've earned it You leave Majorca behind! It must be really beautiful. Yes, but just for lovers. I can hardly remember. I've never seen it. Thank you for the ride. To be honest, it's been a long time since a man last took me home. I can't see why. Outside the ministry you look very pretty. It's the first time you pay me a compliment. - Good night, Carlos. - See you tomorrow, Julia. Hello? Hold on, please. Luisi, your boss is on the phone. He's such a drag! Be quiet, you little brat! Hello, Mr. Ramón? Yes, I'm finishing the letters, they can come and get them in half an hour. One more. Just a second, Mr. Ramón. Add some water to the lentils or they'll get burned. Yes, I'm ready: "According to your letter dated the 13th of this month, we're pleased to enclose an order note that you'll have to pay COD". What? No, I can hear you perfectly well. Will you be quiet! I can't hear a thing! Excuse me, Mr. Ramón, it's the kids. The kids! What do I care about the kids? The office is here, not in your place. No, no, no, you have to send the bills - to Iruretagoyena Bros. - Yes, sir. That's all very clear. Don't cry, my little one. Don't worry, Mr. Ramón. Do you think I can do with a remote secretary? Listen, girl. You'd better solve your problems at home or get your resume ready to look for another job. Oh, Mr. Ramón! Once again I get told off because of you! The Iruretagoyena Bros. Letter! It was the only way to cheer her up. What can I do now!? Get out of my sight! - Lunch time! - I'm starving... Isn't there anywhere else to leave your satchels? And why don't you type in the office? I have to look after you! What a disgrace! - Where's the chocolate? - Can I have some bologna sausage? - I want both! - No way. You'll have to do with just chocolate. And get out of here, I've got some work to do! Luisi, there's a very strange lady at the door. She must be the new maid. I've been sent from Domestic Agency. Are you the lady of the house? Sort of! I guess these children are just visitors. - No, they live here. - Then how many of you are there? Lots! But just seven small ones. And do I have to take care of them all? No, they take care of themselves. They go to school and they are very good. Aren't you? What are your working conditions? - Do you like? - No. - Shoot! - Wait until get her within my range. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays I need all the afternoon off, because I have to go to the hospital to see my cousin. He's been operated on because he had a hernia. - What about Sundays? - I go out with my boyfriend who comes to see me from Navalcarnero. You have a TV set, don't you? Because I love TV: "Jump to fame" and "The Untouchables", I don't miss them. - Don't you want a piano? - What for? To play "La verbena de la Paloma" in your spare time. Hey, are you kidding me? No, but you rather go and jump in a lake. Yes, madam. I'll go, and I'm glad to do so, because this house is as crowded as the subway. Shoot, or she'll get away alive! Stop! - Who was that? - A housemaid. - Hi, Dad. Give me a kiss. - Another one for me. I thought we could pay her off my salary, but she intended to earn more than I do! - Sure, you can't cope with everything. - Luisita, the lentils have stuck. My little one! - Don't worry, you can mash them. - Nothing is working out! On the contrary, you are doing very well. I try my best, but I can't cope with everything. - You'll get used to it. - Come on! And you two? Are you studying or playing Indians? - We are studying. - All afternoon. He can tell you. You have my word. Hello? Jorge! I should hang up on you! Are you proud of yourself? 15 days without hearing from you! You're not in Barcelona? Where are you then? In Madrid. We play on Sunday, aren't you happy? I wanted to give you a surprise. Yeah, we arrived half an hour ago. I'm looking forward to see you. No, the coach won't let us out, he's very strict. Tell your brother to get ready, we're gonna score over 80! Very good, Jorge! Very good! Bravo! Why do you celebrate if it was the other team who scored? Let her do what she likes. - Come on, Juanito! - Let's go and get them! - When will I see you next? - Lf we win in Saragossa we'll come to play the finals next month, and then... I'll just see you but from a distance. - Now, we are together. - A very short time. And in summer I'll see you every day. - And what until summer? - I'll write and call you up. I want to be with you and see you. I'm fed up with having a pen boyfriend. Don't get mad, Luisa. You go very ugly. So much the better! If you don't like me I'll find another boyfriend. There're so many after me. What are you doing here? I've looked for you all over the hotel. Excuse me, miss, but we have to go. Let's get on the bus. Jorge! Jorge! - Hello, sweetie! - Gorgeous! - Jorge. - Luisa. I was only joking before. I'll wait for you until I'm old and decrepit. And I will remember you every day. - We will all remember you. - And we'll cry a lot! - Shut up! Bye! - Bye! Good luck in Saragossa! GOD BLESS CATALONIA Excuse me, does it always take so long? Yes, sir. Mr. Servando lets them talk and talk and then he flunks them all. Well, you're cheering me up! - Are you taking the exam too? - Worse than that, my son is. - Has he crammed or just waits to get lucky? - He has crammed, but... Then go in. You'll be less nervous in there. Thank you. ...it is a surface of revolution, which is the same concept as those domes made up by flat and curve surfaces leaning on their whole outline to be able absorb the push of the pressure lines... ...of the pressure lines, that is intersections... - How is he doing? - At least he answers, a big deal. For example, polygonal domes are those made up of several prismatic spindles... There he was wrong! Excuse me, I mean cylindrical. - Thank God! - What? He's amended it in time. Do you also? After that one, but it will be no good. He's flunking everybody. Everybody? ...that could prove detrimental to the shape integrity, creating efforts ...creating completely harmful to its stability. This all refers to surface of revolution domes, even when... - More relaxed now? - No, sir. More nervous! - Would you like a glass of water? - Lf you were so kind... I'll be right back. Go back to your seat. Mr. Moisés Balaguer Montero. Draw section, ground plan and elevation of St. Pietro's dome. St. Pietro's dome? Mr. Servando, don't you prefer anything about Benidorm? Have fun! See you in September. Dad, I'm an architect! Architect! That sounds good! Your mother used to say "We'd have an architect in the family". We already do. - What I did not achieve... - Now we'll work together. Yes, and we'll make big things: Houses, hotels, theatres, cathedrals... I already can see the advertisements: "Carlos Alonso, quantity surveyor. Antonio Alonso, architect". The other way round, architect comes first. Give me a hug! - Here is your water. - Water? That's for frogs, we're gonna drink champagne. You promised me a straight A! Because you easily promise... and what did you get? - What's this? - Sofia Loren's autograph. Very nice! Sofia Loren's autograph and 6 flunked subjects out of 7. It's just that brother Esteban has taken against me. - And you against me! - It's Spid's fault. He put the ants in the inkwell, but as he has a recommendation... You spend all the day in the amusement arcade with that Horseface and Spid, and smoking too! It's Horse face who smokes. I have noticed you steal 3 cigarettes from me everyday. - Críspulo, you smoke! - No, I always choke... - What are you doing there? - We want to show you our grades? Let the first one come in! - It's my turn. No, me first! - I was first! - One by one! - Look, dad, they are blue! "Application: Fine. Behavior: Regular. Order and cleanliness: Very good. Punctuality: Very good." Learn from your sister! Go to the bathroom! And don't move until I tell you! And there will be no TV in one week or pool on Sunday! Come on, dad, we got good grades. - Me too! - Mine are better! I said no pool on Sunday! - Tomás, can you fix it? - No, sir. The carburetor is dirty and it floods. Do whatever you can. See if you can have it ready by noon. Oh, my God! There are 450.000 cars in Madrid, and it had to be yours! Poor thing! What a state! You won't say it's my fault this time! It's the City's. Look at the pavement! Then you should have taken revenge on a councilman! - I'll clean you up! - You're making it worse! We'd better take it to the dry cleaner's. What an ordeal! You're mad at me, aren't you? I decided long ago never to get mad. You're a great guy. I'm sorry about what happened, but I'm happy too, so I can congratulate you. - Congratulate me? - For your daughter's wedding. She's very pretty. Nobody would say your her father! - Is that a compliment? - You're still in good shape. - But girl, I could be... - My father, I know, or my grandfather... - I'm not that old. - Don't boast about your age just because you have some gray hairs and a few wrinkles... Come on, put your glasses on! What? You men know you look more interesting this way, and you exploit it! Of course, then you and I could have a date! - Why not? - And go out dancing, like two youngsters. Dare to! My friends would be green with envy! - What time is it? - At 10:40 - And why is it 10:40? - Because it's 10:40. I've missed half an hour of my English class! And they are very strict about English at home. I have to go! See you! Your suit is ready. This is what you had in your pockets. - Thank you. And the plans? - What plans? My plans! I left them in that girl's car! She's gone! I'll have to wait until she runs me over again. I wouldn't mind an accident like that every Saturday. Morning! I know the boss asked for me twice. - Are you wearing you son's suit? - It shrunk at the dry cleaner's. - Is it too obvious? - A little bit. That guy from the dry cleaner's? What mood is he in today? His usual. Then it's going to be a nice scolding. Come in! Good morning, Mr. Andrés. - Where on earth have you been? - I... I've been to the building site. It's going on pretty well. We'll soon put the roof on. I'm glad to hear that. - I have some good news. - Are you gonna raise my salary? It might be better. There's a international tender for building a church in Brasilia. The prize it's worthy... - What does that have to do with me? - Not with you, but with your son. It's an excellent opportunity for him. - Do you really think my boy? - Of course! At least he should try. If his project got mentioned that would already be a victory. That's very true. You should see his enthusiasm in everything he does. Here are the rules. Take it! Thanks, Mr. Andrés. This will cheer him up. He said he's bored since he finished his studies. We've all gone through that. Beginnings are always difficult. - Yes, sir. That's true. - All right. Good luck! Thank you. - Luisa, open the door. - She's not in. - Tell Carlota to open. - She's out with the little ones. - You go and open, then. - I'm sick. I have sore throat. I told you to open the door! I can't! I may drop the thermometer! Then I'll call the nurse to come and give you an injection. No, don't call her. I'm okay. It's just 35 degrees. - Hello, is your father in? - No. I bring this for him. He left it in my car. - He might need it. - Come in, please, madam. Are you gonna address me so formally? Don't you remember me? I think I saw you once, but I can't remember where. The important thing is that you do remember me. Your father talks a lot about all of you. - You are the eldest, aren't you? - Yes. - And your name is Carlos too? - No, Antonio. - Are you a quantity surveyor like him? - No, I'm an architect. How strange! I always thought architects were very old men. What are you working on? A theater. The most modern in the world. That's great! Where are you gonna build it? Nowhere. I do it just for fun. And what's this beautiful thing? My house. Actually our house. My father must have told you that we are very crowded at home but here there's a bedroom for each one of us, and enough bathrooms and a garden and a pool... You lack nothing. My mother always wished to live in a place like this, in the country with chicken and flowers everywhere. I'll build this some day. You're amazing. I'll ask you to design my house. But don't build your hopes up. First I'd have to win the lottery and I never get the right numbers. - What time is it? - Five past twelve. I missed my physics class! What a day! I must go. Don't forget to give those rolls to your father. - He must be cursing me. - Don't you worry. - Goodbye, Mr. Architect. - Bye. - My name's Patricia. - Bye, Patricia. Alonso, it's your son. - Come in. Is everything alright? - I just came to bring you this. - This? And what's this? - Your plans. Oh yes! My plans! Where were they? You left them in Patricia's car. - Whose car? - Patricia's. - I don't know any Patricia. - You don't need to lie to me. - Don't think that woman and I... - Don't give me any explanations. - But I want to! - Okay... There's been nothing but crashes between that woman and me. She didn't tell you otherwise, did she? - No, she's been very nice. - Don't trust her. - And she's very pretty. - She's a monster! - Don't you think she's pretty? - I didn't even notice. Come on, you've always had a good taste. Hello? I'm not here. I tell you I'm not here. Make something up. Tell him I've gone to Logroño. Did you finish the theater? - No. I have to finish up the last details. - Then forget about it. Here you have your new project and it's a big one this time. BONANZA We have to save your brother from the Apaches. Give me the gun. You go to jail. We'll free you. Is it OK like this or shall I put more butter? - That's too much. - It smells great! What has my little lady prepared for dinner? Something that'll make your mouth water. - Chicken with tomato. - Better than that! - Daddy, poo. - Oh, my god! Yes, baby, I'll take you right away. Leave that, your husband must be waiting for you. No, he's coming to pick me up. You're so good a it! Those collars, those cuffs... I don't like you to go like this. You are a gentleman! - It doesn't matter. - I won't tolerate it as long as I can help it. You know what I'm going to do? Dye your hair. - Daddy, poo. - Yes, sweetie. - In the duck, dad, in the duck. - Yes, in the duck. Very good. Be careful! - Don't be long. I'm bored. - In jail again? - Yes, dad. - Take this, get away. - Eight times eight is 48. - Babes, it's sixty four. Whatever I say the teacher just gives me a C. The teacher's got it in for me. You're lucky if she gives you a C when you multiply like that. Has Juanito arrived yet? He's working out. He takes it very seriously. He intends to go to the Mexico Olympic Games and he will! Sabina, are you still stuck there? Don't interrupt me. I'm getting it right. I'm finished, daddy. I'm finished. - Where's dad? - Over there! - How come you're back so soon? - I got fired. What? Mr. Ramón got mad and said: "I can't stand it any longer". My salary and my pay-off. I'm sorry about the 2500 that came in so handy. It's okay, we'll just have to tighten our belts. It bugs me because it's too much for you alone. Some you lose, some you win. - Aren't you angry then? - Why should I? There are plenty of jobs but very few intelligent secretaries. - And you are one of them! - You're great, dad! Why do you let her spend the whole day here. - They are her family! - And you are her husband! But I'll put an end to this at once! Mom, don't raise hell over this! We can't let her get upstairs. Watch out for Eulogio. "Wrongfunctioning" again. Was repaired and It greased yesterday and it's "brokenized" already. Help... Somebody let me out! Which "aforementioned" floor are you in? - How can I know! It's dark! - Oh, gee! Help! Help, Help! Come soon or I'm going to die! Those from the third left must have buttoned it up. - I'm coming, I'm coming! - Help! Help! What's up, Eulogio? It's okay, Mr. Carlos, the possibility just "schematized". Minors keep back. Give me a hand, Mr. Carlos, we have to "violate" the door. - Oh, god, I'm fainting! - That's my daughter's mother-in-law. Alberto, what are you doing there? The young man first. The young man first. Come on up, boy! - Are you hurt? - Now the "elderly". When I get out I'm gonna tell you a few home truths. - I can let go of you! - Hold on tight, madam! - Dear, hold me. I'm a bit dizzy. - What's up? - Did you get frightened, my love? - Alberto... What's up, love? She got "plastified". - Get back, let her breathe. - Oh my God. Get away from here. I don't know what's wrong. Everything is spinning around. Didn't you hear me? Everybody to the hall! Give her some water and a bit of brandy for me. She's so pale... There's nothing to worry about. It's something quite usual, - isn't it, Mercedes? - Dad... - Shall I go and get the doctor? - What you should get is a dummy. Yes, sir, at once. A dummy? Is that possible? My love! Dad, I wanna play here. Behave yourself, girl. You're gonna become an aunt. Thank you, Mr. Andrés. - What did he say? - He asked if I know La Coruña. - What else? - And if I wanna earn 50000 pesetas. - And you said yes, of course. - Certainly. Congratulations. When are you leaving? That's the problem, I'll have to be out for a couple of weeks. Julia, deal with Mr. Alonso's ticket. - Yes, sir. - Good afternoon and have a good trip. Thank you. Don't make any reservations yet. But why? It means pts. 50000 and a holiday First I need some advice from you. - From me? - Are you very busy now? - No. - Then come with me, I need a drink. - I think that's your father. - Yes, it's him. What a surprise! Whenever we meet you get hurt. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm alright, but put on your glasses, you look prettier with them on. Julia, a workmate of mine. - Good afternoon! - Hi Julia. We're going dancing. Why don't you come with us? - I have the car right there. - No. No car. We're going to talk about work. Oh, I see. Beware of him. He's irresistible. What do we drink to, your holidays in La Coruña? And the fact that my architect's got a girlfriend at last! - I'm going to miss you, Carlos. - I haven't gone yet. And I have to solve the problem with the children. That is worrying you so much? What shall I do with them, send them to the orphanage? Nonsense! We've never been apart... and 15 days is a long time. I'll look after them! You? Obviously you don't know them... I like children very much. Had I got married, I'd have loved to have as many as you do. - I give them all to you. - Are you sure? No. They need me, but I think I need them even more. I can't go away. You're very kind, but I can't accept your offer. The thing is that I have no one to leave that troop with. Wait, there's someone who can't say no. He'll accept as soon as I ask him. - No way! - It's just 15 days. You're a hopeless fool. I'm not gonna leave everything to go and deal with those monsters? - But it's not gonna be forever. - Not even for a short while. Then what am I supposed to do with the children? Put them to beg. Have a good day, Mrs. Rosario. I'd rather give you that 50000 than put up with those kids. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - He won't do me a little favor. - Little favor... Look, I was at the battle of Brunete and I swear it was a children's play compared to your house. - But let's... - Don't say a word. Can't you see that I need a person - with authority for my children? - Of course. You're morally obliged. - Me? - The godfather substitutes the father. That's if the father dies. Die and we'll see... The priest said that it's your obligation to take the place of the father when he's not around, and I'm gonna be away for a few days. Let the priest take your place, God helps him if he has cope with your children! - I think that if we try... - You don't try anything! They'll burn me alive and call me a buffalo. Come on, Buffalo Bill was a hero in the West! To hell with heroes! I said I'm not going! - Welcome, sir. Good morning. - Good morning. I have a reservation. - Alonso, Carlos Alonso. - Okay, here you are. Can you tell us something in advance? Could you just give us a hint? - We'll talk tomorrow, I'm very tired. - What time? Call me up, but not all at once. - Alright! See you tomorrow! - Good morning! Excuse me, but no one can give you a better offer than mine. I said tomorrow! Now those jerks are gone, we could get to an agreement. I'll pay more than anybody else! - Tomorrow, please. - Take my card. I'll be the first one here. - And what do you want? - Me? Well... - Didn't you hear me? - No. - Please go away with the others. - I meant to stay... Not today, come back tomorrow and bring with you a written offer. A what? Look, don't waste my time! My key! - Yes, madam. - And nothing less than 6 millions. Six millions? I just want a room! - 314, sir. - Thank you. - What does that lady sell? - Lots. - Lots of things? - No, no, sites. She's come from Mexico to do that. Hello? Hi, yes, it was about time! Yes, put me through. This is dad! I'm sorry, sir, but the line is still engaged. And you call me to say that? Maybe you didn't plug the pin as you should. Okay, let's see if I can talk at 8 o'clock in the morning. I'm sure it's you, Luisita. Or one of Críspulo's misdeeds! Good night, kids! But Eliot Ness and his seven good men, the Untouchables, made up their mind to finish Frank Nitty and his henchmen off. And that night, in a brewery outside Chicago... Let's go for the second one! You've already eaten enough. These are for tomorrow. Stop! Just the chocolate one. Look, Godmother. Chencho! Girl! - Get out of my way, you moron! - Shut up! Sure, Jorge. So early next month? But will you stay longer? Don't be silly, I'm stuck here at home! I never go out... Let's go to bed. Everybody off to sleep! Why don't we play a bit longer? Do as godfather says or there will be no candy tomorrow. Off to bed... Let's go to bed. Stop talking on the phone. It's over midnight! As you please, but write to me! And behave yourself over there, because you try to control me but nobody is watching you! Let's go to bed, let's go to bed... - Where is he? - He's hidden. He's playing hide and seek! - Did dad called? - No, where have you been? - At the movies. - With that blonde! - I'm gonna... - Show some respect. - The telephone bill is going to ruin us... - He's paying, you know? No, it was the big one. - Go on, never mind. - What are you doing here? - We're playing with the godfather - He doesn't get out. Godfather! What are you doing in there? Don't ask and get me out of here! - Where I am? - Can't you play a different game? Taxi! Taxi! Good morning, Mr. Alonso. Good morning. Now you know who I am? Excuse me, I'm so ashamed of myself... I don't know how to apologize. I thought you were with those annoying men... - I don't know anybody here... - It doesn't matter. - I'm also terribly absent-minded - Will you forgive me? - There's nothing to forgive. - Thank you. Can I give you a ride? Don't bother, I'm going pretty far. - It doesn't matter! - Lf you'd be kind as to take me to the south area. Do you know it? - I've never been in La Coruña. - Neither have I. We should reduce the kitchens and enlarge the bathrooms. - We can get an extra 20 cm. - That's right. Women need more space to do themselves up - than to cook. - Yes, sir. - See you tomorrow! - Bye. - What are you doing here? - I'm waiting for you. I can't believe you've been waiting one hour and a half. There aren't many cabs around and I have nothing to do. I would like to ask you a favor. You are the building contractor, aren't you? - No. - The architect. No. Just the quantity surveyor. I'm just visiting. Anyway, I've come to sell some building lots, but I don't understand anything about it. I need some advice to know their real value. Would you mind coming along with me? Don't rely on me too much because I can only draw lines. Anyway I think it's worth a lot more than what they offer. The place is very good and there's enough room to build a large tourist center. But I don't want to build anything. I live in Mexico. My parents left me this place, but I just want to sell it and go back there. It's a pity. My son and I would do wonders with this place. - Did I tell you he's an architect? - Your son? Yes, the eldest. A great boy! But the other one... He's also good, but he doesn't aim so high. The twins, they'll be true professors, and Federico Guillermo will be a great doctor, and Críspulo... I don't know what he will be, but he'll be very important. As for the girls, you know. Luisita is the best secretary you can get, - and Luzgarda a soprano, and... - But, are there more still? Sure. There's still Chencho, Sabina, María, Mónica... sometimes I lose count. - How many children do you have? - Sixteen! I'm sorry for your wife, poor thing! You should put her up in a pedestal. We should somehow. She died three years ago, when the youngest was born. I've felt so alone since then... You see, and with so many children! Of course I can't tell them, but I still need her. I haven't got used to living without her yet. Excuse me. I always put my foot in it. Hello? Carlos! How are you? I'm so happy to hear you... - How are you doing there? - Very good. No, no swimming, that's for the young. Julia, what mood is the boss in today? No mood. He hasn't come in yet. Yes, I'll tell him whatever you say. I'll write it down. Yes, alright. What? You're not coming back on Tuesday? - I see... - It's just a few more days. No, no problems, but I want to leave everything ready. Could you please call my family and tell them that I'm alright? And ask them to hang up the phone. I can never get through! Sure, don't worry. You're welcome. Bye, Carlos. Let's go and check it. - 1.50. - You see? As I had it on the map. If you don't talk with the architect we won't get anywhere. Okay. Leave it until I talk to him. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. I've tried to reach you several times, - but you get up so early... - Are you okay? Yes, I have some good news to tell you: I've sold all the lots and I've got plenty more - than I expected. - I'm glad for you! I owe it all to you. I did as you said and it worked out. Now I would like to ask you another favor. - Do you have more land to sell? - No. No, but I have no one to dine with tonight. - May I invite you? - No way. I'll invite you. We'll discuss that on our way. I was born in Tasco, a very Spanish village. Actually the whole of Mexico is very Spanish but our own way. We have a lot of things in common, but also our own heritage. For instance, the mariachis. Have you ever heard them singing? And you? Have you ever seen the sevillanas dancing? And what about Zócalo Square and Insurgentes Avenue? And what about Gran Vía, Cibeles and Puerta del Sol? - And Acapulco? - And the Costa Brava? - And tequila? - Have you ever tried the Chinchón wine? - And you the chili? - Here we have hot peppers... - What are they talking about? - Hot peppers! I wish you knew Mexico. And I wish you knew Madrid. Why don't you stay for a while? You would enjoy it very much. I'm sure of that. I would show you the Prado Museum, El Escorial, Luis Candelas caves, all the tourist things. - And would you have enough time? - I would arrange it. It would be good for me too. Honestly, I've never seen them either. Actually there are a lot of things I haven't seen. You just live for your work and for your children. You can't imagine how much they eat! Can I ask you a quite indiscreet question? Go ahead! Have you ever though of getting married again? Nonsense! Why does everybody ask the same? - Even you... - You're still young. Who was going to put up with me and my sixteen children? - Any woman who loved you. - And where's that woman? Have you taken the trouble to search for her? To be honest I haven't. I never had time for that. That's a fib! You just sacrifice your happiness for your children, because they are the only thing that matters to you. Maybe you're right. CALL JUANITO AT 8:00 - Come on! - Are they all asleep? Are you sure they all drank water and had a pee? - Yes, come on. - I'm pooped, Paula. We can still sleep for a while. - What shall I do? - Pick up the phone. They may hear it! Hello? Yes, speaking. It had to be you! - Just when I was going to bed! - Quiet! So late? Have you been partying? Yes, with your children. I haven't slept a wink! Neither have I! I don't care whether you've slept or not. Look at the bags under my eyes! No, you can't talk to them now, they're asleep! Daddy, it's daddy! - It's daddy! - Daddy! - Wait. - Daddy! One moment! They all want to speak at the same time. Wait a second. I want to speak to daddy... Calm down! Calm down! And I'm going to join the Foreign Legion! One by one. Hi, Sabina! Oh, you're Victoria Eugenia. You got a C plus in Geography? Congratulations. Mónica, dear! You have toothache? I bet it feels better now. Chencho! How are you, man? When am I coming back? Soon. One day less now! - My gorgeous! - Daddy I've eaten cakes! Hi, Carlos! Yes, don't worry, they're all very well. Daddy, kisses. No, not at all, I'm playing the mother part, and I love it. Don't pay him any attention. He's enjoying it even more than I do although he won't admit it. He's such a grumbler! Yes, very well. The little ones are very well. Why didn't you tell me? Don't be mad at me, but I preferred to leave without seeing you. Farewells make me feel very sad. I had got used to the idea that you would stay. - There's nothing for me to do here. - Is somebody waiting for you there? No, nobody important! I'm not so lucky. You have your kids waiting for you. Yes, they're counting the hours. And so are you, aren't you? I've already told you I feel lost without them. They must love you a lot. I envy you, Carlos. Deep down you're a happy man! Wait! I'd like to be with you until the ship sets sail. No, let's say goodbye here, Carlos. Thanks for everything. I'd love to build a house in Mexico designed by you and your son. Goodbye, Ana. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Welcome, Mr. Carlos. Did you have a nice trip? Yes, my children didn't get the telegram? Yes sir, I handed it in with the rest of the "mailment". But they haven't come to the station... I can't "aprise" you on that, because as they come and go and never stop and this is a retirement. You'll have to use the stairs, because Críspulo and the machinery aberrations have turned it out of order. - I can't believe it! - I'll take your baggage upstairs later. Children! Family! Isn't anybody at home? - Congratulations, daddy! - Congratulations! - Hello! - Congratulations! But what day is today? Your birthday! You've turned 50! - 48, if you don't mind. - It doesn't matter. Enough for you to settle down. - You feel like quarreling again? - I just feel like going home! Are you going on again? Happy birthday, Carlos. Thank you, Paula, - How are you? - As if in heaven. - Do you treat her well? - Like a museum piece. - I didn't expect to see you here. - I wanted to give you a hug... - And this. This is what I've earned. - Money! But... it's yours. No, dad. It's about time we help you a bit. You make me very happy, because it reminds me that some of my kids don't need me anymore. Daddy, daddy. You half-tongue! I was looking forward to seeing you. Well, to seeing you all. And Juanito? He's training, of course. Basketball is his whole life. - No, dad, he's gone. - Gone? Where to? - Italy. - Italy! He's in the national team, and so is Jorge! His photo is in the paper. Read it: "Juanito Alonso, the big promise of the Spanish basketball, has been chosen for the junior games to be played in Italy, France and Switzerland". So I have to learn from the papers that my son is in the national team! Don't look at me, I told them... - It was me, dad. - It was all of us. We were afraid that you wouldn't let him go and he looked so excited... And so am I. Of course I'm very happy that my son is playing in Italy. But you could have told me before. - I'll give it to him! - No, I'll do! - It's my turn! - It's mine! Be careful. - Daddy, it's our present. - We all bought it for you. - I took the money out of my piggybank. - What's this? Open it! Open it! What beautiful ties! Made of natural silk. They must have cost you a lot. You needed them. The black one makes you look older! Sweetie, it's so colorful... It's the latest fashion. I chose them myself. - They look better. - Sure. Doesn't he look better? Daddy, handsome. We also have some good news for you. - Octavio Augusto and Julio César. - You always get mixed up. That's true, you are the one with the moustache. You should shave... Tell me the news. - The grant. - The grants. - Both? - Yes, dad. "Gijón University"... So you also leave? I'm happy for you. There you'll become grown-up men. We have to go next week. On Monday. If I stay away a bit longer... you leave me alone. Will you blow out the candles or not? The cake is melting and it's my present for you. You're so generous. Maybe you put some dynamite in it. - Maybe! - Come on everybody blow with me! Ready? One, two, three! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DADDY HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DADDY Happy birthday! - 48, 49, and 50. - Grands! - The wages. - That's already spent. - And the bonus. - Not too bad this month! Bad? You get what I make in two years! But you're single, Ramírez. Get married and have children. I prefer to earn less. BIG SALES Shall I put the pajamas in the case too? - Yes, two in each. - And the panties? No, leave the panties apart. How many are there? - Two dozens. - Different sizes? Yes, sir. Two, three, four and five. Carlota, size five is for you? - Dad! - I have another lady at home. Dad, do you like it? How do I look? - It seems tailor-made! - Then I'll keep it. Sure! That's why I have this fresh money! - We could shorten the sleeves a bit. - No, I like it like this. I'll go if you don't mind, I have a date with Patricia. Then change your clothes and don't keep her waiting! - Well, as I have it on already. - Sure, keep it on! - See you! - But remove the labels at least! Here you have the shirts, the underpants and the towels. - What about the socks? - Three dozens. - How do you like it? - Why different? Because we always look alike. As it should be, you're twins! But this one's always takes advantage. He's the eldest. He's 20 minutes older than you. I'm the one who's 20 minutes older. Where shall I put the raincoats? In the cases, and the jumpers too. Are they warm? We're not going to the North Pole! Gijón is very nice, but it's always raining there! - May I come in? - No, you don't fit in there. Yes, I do! - Your pills. You always forget! - Thank you! - I need some money. - Again? It's the beginning of the month. It's going to be the end of my savings. I have to do the shopping for 3 days. Here. Is it enough? Everything is so expensive... I'll manage with this. What do you want for lunch? I thought of asparagus as a first course. To have asparagus here we'd need the whole year's harvest and some imported ones. Artichokes then. They are boring. One leaf, another one... - You see one, you've seen them all. - Potatoes were made for us! And cod! Alright, I'll fix cod and potatoes today then. Good! Nutritious food. A bit of skin here, a bone there. It's great fun. - A telegram! - It must be from your brothers. "We arrived safe. Kisses. Twins". They are thrifty too. They could have mentioned the weather in Gijón. What's your brother doing? Chencho! - Chencho! - I'm here! - Doesn't he look great? - Like a proper little man! Come on! What's up? Aren't you happy? It's your first day of school. Yes, but it's Críspulo's bag and it's broken. - Daddy will buy you a new one. - I have no pencil box. - I'll buy you one too. - And a pencil sharpener! Yes, but let's go. It's getting late. - Goodbye. - See you. - Bye, dad. - Bye. - Good morning, Mr. Carlos. - Hi! Chencho, going to school already? He must become a man. Yes, sir. He doesn't look like a boy, he looks like a person, and forgive my bragging. - The milkman has given me the bill. - 1,700 pesetas? Excuse my "discretion", monthly payments feel more expensive. The important thing is that the milk is not "adulterous". This is unbelievable! Then get ready for when we buy coal for the heater. I've got the "suppository" that they're going to raise it too! I wouldn't be surprised. See you! Bye. I hope the "scholastic" has a good start at the academy! Gosh! How can you get up so early to run over people? Does your insurance company still pay the bills? I have my glasses on, and it's your son's fault! - My son's? - Yes, sir. He asked me to bring him these books. You have "demobilize" it! That jalopy was bad enough, but now you've given it the coup de grâce... Mind your own business. Will you give this to Mr. Antonio? To me it's indifferent, "implausible". - Aren't we going to school? - Yes, but on foot. I can't have my brother in law - walk to school! - Hey! Chencho, not in her car! Chencho! I'm so happy to have another Alonso at school. It seems like yesterday when you brought Antonio! - That was 20 years ago. - 21. I remember it very well. I always said he'd be very successful. And you look very smart too. - But I have no pencil box. - I'll give you one. Come on, give dad a kiss and come with me. Bye, son! I want a pencil box! Mr. Alonso wants a pencil box... - And a pencil sharpener. - Of course! A pencil, a book and a rubber... You'll have all that, don't worry. See you tomorrow, slave. You'll never learn! Do you know what the time is? - Hi, Julia! Are you going home? - Yes, and you should go too. - I wanted to finish this. - Leave it for tomorrow! - You look very tired. - Yes, I'm worn out! Then go out for a walk. Get some fresh air! - Speak to yourself, if you please. - Speak to myself? - Sometimes it works! - Wait! I guess you don't go about speaking to yourself! - Maybe. - No. So you'd be speaking to yourself and I to myself? - Why don't we go together? - You and me? Why not? Is there something wrong? No, it's just taken me by surprise. Why? It had to happen sooner or later. What about your kids? I don't think they'll tell me off if I arrive a bit later. I'll be back in a minute! Hurry up! I don't want the boss to spoil our walk. There's no one here! I'm the cleaning woman. Excuse me, Mr. Andrés. I was joking. Yes, I'm coming right away! I'm ready. What are you doing here? I'm waiting for Mr. Alonso. Mr. Alonso? But he's taken off! - Anything happened? - Certainly! They have chosen his son's pre-project in Brasilia. He's gone nuts! No wonder. He wouldn't be so happy if he had got the prize himself. That man just lives for his kids! Good night, Julia. Good night. - Hi, daddy. - Hi, daddy. - Hi! - They want to cut my hair. - Where's Antonio? - In his bedroom. He's going out with the blonde! Antonio, my son. I'm the happiest father in the world! As soon as I found out I rushed here to tell you! I already know. - How? Who told you? - I received this cable. And how can you be so unfazed? Do you know what this means to you? You've become an important man. You've succeeded! Daddy, come to play! Daddy, come to play! Baby, say "hello" to the most important architect in Spain. And the son who's made me so proud! You're going to make me cry! Cry then! We're all very happy! Yes, so happy that I can hardly believe it. Mr. Andrés told me, and the cable is very clear. Where are my glasses? "We are pleased to tell you your pre-project was given the first prize". You see? First prize! "Your presence is required in Brasilia to prepare execution of project". Don't worry. I'll just go to pick up the prize and tell them that I can't stay, that I've got too much to do here... Why? Because two years is a long time and we couldn't do all we had planned. To work together, to see our names in the facade, as you've always said. This would have been our first job. That doesn't matter. All that matters is you, your future. We'll have time to work together. After all, you're not leaving forever! You've sacrificed so many things for me, to give me an education. And now, when success comes, it's just for me. Your success is my success. This will make up for everything, even not having you with me and not seeing you. Come on! Cheer up and tell Patricia. So, aren't you sad? Sad? I only have reasons to be very happy. And to thank God. - I'm very proud of you! - And I'm very proud of you. This morning took a plane to Brazil the young Spanish architect Antonio Alonso, the winner of the international contest of pre-projects for a church in Brasilia. The General Manager of Architecture and other authorities saw him off at the airport. His family and classmates were also there to give him an enthusiastic farewell. Good luck, son! Foreign news. The Vietnam situation has gone worse since Vietcong guerillas have in the last 24 hours... Daddy, pee... Daddy, water... I can't hear you, dad, come... I'm coming, children. - I'm frightened. - Quiet. Light, light. - Dad, water. - I'm coming. Dad, pee. Yes, come on, baby. Daddy, tell me a story. No, it's too late. Go to sleep. - Come on. - Daddy, sit down. Close your eyes. Go to sleep, my baby. The Lord looks after you. - Daddy, I love you very much. - And I love you. Go to sleep, my baby. Daddy looks after you. And your little eyes look like stars. My little baby has a wooden cradle and two little angels that take care of her. We'll grow old, my dear, without realizing. And some day they'll leave us all alone. And we'll be again like in the beginning, just you and me. But when they come to visit, they'll tell us their things and we'll be happy again. Even though they leave, they'll always be in our hearts. Hello? Yes, it's me. What? Where is she? So tiny... Did you want him to be already graduated? - He's beautiful, he has taken after me! - No, madam. That is my nose. And those eyes and the chin. My son hasn't contributed at all? - My sweet! - He's very cute, isn't he? Just like you. Can we come in? Congratulations! Be careful, kids. One by one. I can't believe you're a mom. - What an invasion! - This is a large family, madam. - Grandfather! - Godfather! Let me see him. He's beautiful! Hi, buddy! I'm your uncle Críspulo. I am his uncle! - You're gonna break him! - Come on, do as grandma says! What are you doing? Madam, I have some experience in this. - My first grandson! - Here is your chocolate bar. Are you giving the baby chocolate? Yes, madam! That's how I fed them all and you see how healthy they are. We're not alone, Mercedes. You can see it. They leave, but then others arrive. There's one more member in the big family! THE END
