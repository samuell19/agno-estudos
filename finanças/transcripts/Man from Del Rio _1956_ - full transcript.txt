The town's still asleep. Like we should be. There's Bannister's place. Who is the man in front of the saloon? Just a man in front of a saloon. Who cares? Ritchy? Mr. Dan Ritchy? That's right. I... I've been waiting for you. You live around here? No. But you're waiting for me. I was in Ellsworth. I heard you was coming to Mesa. Why should that interest you? My name is Robles. David Robles. You remember the name? I heard the name. Every year there are at least five loudmouths with a few notches on their guns... You hear their names. Most of them die before you get to meet 'em. Go on back to Ellsworth, Robles... I don't want to kill you. Go and show glory some place else. Mr. Dan Ritchy... Got to force it? You remember Del Rio five years ago? I remember Del Rio, not you. Oh, I was there. So was you. So was Thomas, Tharp... and Bentley. They're dead. Yeah, I know. You... waited a long time for this, didn't you? It took me five years to learn to use a gun. All right. Count to three. One... Two... Three. You... Before you say anything, mister, think it over. That's Dan Ritchy. Is there a doctor in town? You outdrew Ritchy? I don't believe it. Would you like to go to hell and ask himself? Well, I... If you don't mind there's a... I should make a report. Your name is... Robles. David Robles. This boy needs a doctor. Quit playing like a sheriff, Tillman. - Go on. Vamoose. - Well... Name's Ed Bannister, son. Are you a doctor? No, but I'll be glad to show you where the doc lives. You know, any man who could outdraw Dan Ritchy, I got a lot of respect for. I sent for him. Come up here for a little talk couple of weeks ago. And you had to go kill him as soon as he gets into town. I ought to be mad at you. But like I say, you got my respect. I can't be mad at a man I respect. He must have been quite a friend. Oh, gun fighters got no friends except other gun fighters. You mean you've never heard of me? Ed Bannister? - No. - That's strange. Why, boy, when I hung up my Colt, there was 14 cuts on the handle. Yes, sir. First time I ever drew on a man, I was only 16. Right in there, boy. Oh, Doc! Hey, Doc! You got business. I'm not deaf. I heard the shots. What am I today, doctor or mortician? Both. You patch up this wound and you bury the other one. Thanks for the trade, Bannister. Both friends of yours, I take it. You two gonna talk while I bleed to death? Get up. Up. Over here. Sit down. That's it. Unbutton the shirt. How is it, Doc? Too bad. It's only a scratch. Well, Davey boy... Why don't you come up to my place after Doc fixes you up? All you want to drink, on the house. - Yeah, I might do that. - Fine. Take good care of him, Doc. Who'd you kill? - Dan Ritchy. - Oh, him. Who are you? Dave. Robles. It's fine. I'll remember the name. And when somebody kittles you, I can also say, "Oh, him." Hold still. Good morning, Estella. Good morning, Doc. This one's ready for bandaging, and the other one's ready for burying. It's only a flesh wound. Put some carbolic acid on it and a nice bandage. Will it hurt much, Doc? Not as much as a rope around your neck. - He's very funny. - Take off your coat. Why doesn't he stay and take care of me? Take off your coat, I said. Well, I'm not used to woman doctors. Did you ever hear about soap? Yeah, you're very funny, too. This whole town's funny. If you'd rather see tears, why don't you ride and find the family of the man you just killed? What do you know about the man I killed? Just that he was a man who was killed. Is there more to know? You ride to Del Rio, see how many people are crying because Dan Ritchy is dead. But I do not live in Del Rio. I live here in Mesa. And I charge $1. I'll have to owe you. You don't believe I'll pay you? Yes, I believe you. Ed? Let's get a box ready for Ritchy. I'll give you a hand. Breezy, come back here. Oh. Later, Doc. Hey! Mr. Robles. Mr. Robles. Mr. Robles, I took care of your horse. I... I'm the one who took care of your horse. Got him all rubbed down and fed, even before you took care of Ritchy. Much obliged. Well, anything I can do for you, Mr. Robles. Just say the word. Thanks. Oh, thank you. Anything... Any... Oh. Anything at all. Mr. Robles, folks around here call me Breezy. Breezy Morgan. Hi, Breezy. Well... Good to see you're all patched up. Yeah. Guess I was pretty lucky at that? Welcome to the friendliest spot in Mesa. What's your pleasure? I'll have whiskey, I guess. Make it two, will ya? - On your way, Breezy. - Oh, no, Ed... I catch you bothering Mr. Robles here, I'll twist your nose off. Give him a drink. He took care of my horse. Well, keep an eye on him, Davey. Sure, he'll do you a favor if there's anything in it for him. Oh, no, Ed. Trouble is, he'll do anything against you for the same reason. Here's your drink, Breezy. Drink it and scat. Much obliged, Ed. You, too, Mr. Robles. You know... one of these days I'm gonna treat you to a drink. Yeah, I will. Look. I got a claim staked out in the west. You know, me and a friend. One day it's gonna pay off. He's been mooching drinks with that story from everyone in town. You believe me. Don't you, Mr. Robles? Oh, I believe you, Breezy. Drink up, Davey boy, to a pleasant stay in Mesa. You're gonna like it here, boy. Nice place to come to and take it easy. You had your drink. Get out. Go on, get out! You'll be in good company soon enough, Davey. Some friends of mine ought to drop in any minute. Fred Jasper and the Dawson brothers. Names familiar? Oh, I heard of 'em. Why're they coming here? 'Cause I asked 'em to, like I did Ritchy. They all like it here. Hard to see why. It's a pretty dull town. Davey boy, a gun fighter is not very welcome most places. He's got to keep one eye on the law and one on the vigilantes. But here a man can relax, drink all he wants to, see old friends, and not worry about the law. Here. Your card. Dave... Robles. There. Right. Now you're one of the boys. There's quite a few cards up there. You bet. You should see the names on those cards. Some of the fastest guns this side of San Luis. Go on, put your mark on it. Oh, wait. Use my gun. Go on, try it. It's quite a gun. That gun, in its time, commanded a lot of respect. Yeah. It's pretty good. Yippee! That's Fred Jasper. Fred can't just ride into town, he's gotta crash into it. Come on in, you old weasel! George, Bill, you boys are looking great. We'll feel great after a drink. You been in Wichita forever? Couple of days only. It's too quiet around there. Marshal's locked up half the town. Well, you won't find any prodding lawman around here. Hey, can you remember when the cowherds came up this way? It was quite a town. I can't figure a man like you in a dead town like Mesa. Well, maybe I mean to bring it to life. Let's have a little fun first. Then we can sit down and have a long talk. I got an idea you boys might really go for. Well, Dave, come on over here and meet my friends. Boys, this here is Dave Robles. This is George Dawson, his brother, Billy, and this ugly old cousin is Fred Jasper. Hi. Robles? Didn't you have a run in with Bob Tharp last month? Just outside of Dodge. Who cares about Tharp? Dave here got himself one of the best this morning. Dan Ritchy. You got Dan Ritchy? I... Mister... I drink this one to you. I've seen Ritchy draw before. Fast as a cat. Hope you can stick around for a while, Dave. I got no reason to stick around. Well, you're among friends, boy. Any man who can gun down Ritchy. Fred? You bet. You won't want for friends around here, Robles. When word spreads that you got Ritchy, you just watch at how the folks smile on you. But keep to your own kind, boy, like us. That's right. Drink up, Dave. Where else can you find free drinks and a friendly bunch like this? You keep pouring, I'll keep drinking. Think that looks tight enough, Doc? I guess so, Ken. You feel like doin' some digging? I'm sorry, Doc. Old man Logan needs his horse showered by noon. I promised. You know, I'm sorry. Well, is Breezy around? Ain't seen him. Never do when you need him. He promised to help me with the diggin'. All right, Ken, let's load him up. All right. Doc, you got a minute? Hello, Ken. We have to talk to you, Doc. If you got a few spare muscles, give us a hand. - Sure. - Nice box, Ken. Thanks. Ken, you better get busy with old man Logan's horse if you're gonna make any money. I'll help you with the box and I'll sell Ritchy's pony and saddle, and I'll split it with you, Doc. Well, that's fair enough. Let's lift. Doc, about this trouble... - Now, come on, Tom, let's get to work. - Oh, yeah. What's on your mind, Roy? Bannister. And this. We've let it far enough, Doc. When Bannister rode in here a month ago and opened that place up, I said right off, "We're in for trouble." You remember that? Exactly what I said, "We're in for trouble." Tom, you are a living prophet. You really are a living prophet. But you talk too much. Put your end in first. See you later, boys. You gotta be serious, Doc. All Bannister's done for the past month is liquor up any riff-raff gunman he can get to pass this way. No man opens a saloon and spends his time givin' away his stock. I'll be darned if I can figure it out either. And until I can, I don't aim to kill myself worrying about it. You boys want to come along to the funeral? No, thanks. Let's force Jack Tillman to do his duty as sheriff. It's gettin' hot, boys, and I got some diggin' to do. Let's talk about it again? Breezy! Where have you been? - Oh... - Come on! Comin', Doc. Comin'. We'll see you later, boys. Let's find Tillman. - Get me the... - you big sissy! Come on and play, Jasper. Get with it, you big sissy! Mr. Jasper. Do you mind? One of you boys better miss it, or we'll be drinking out of tin cups. - You made me miss. - $5. - You... - Come on, give me my $5 first. Good thing I won. Man, I was broke. Broke? Well, how'd you aim to pay if you was broke? - Well? - -What is it you want, Tillman? Well, it's not really me, Ed. It's... The folks, you know. I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Hey, Fred. I'll be damned... if he don't have one of those pretty tin stars just like the one we took off that nice man in Silver City. Remember? Do you think we ought to make it a pair? Let's have a drink. Over here. Hey, Fred, he can't drink. He's on duty. Yeah, duty. You're on duty? You come in here and do your duty. Well, boys, I... Come on, pals, we was having fun before. - Yeah. - -We can have fun with Jack here. Come here, Jack. Come... Well, I'll come back later. I got somethin' else to do. Why don't you stick around here with us? Sure, Dave. Fun's just gettin' started. Yeah. I... I want to go and see a girl. A girl? Oh, Davey, you've come to the wrong town. You got to go to Dodge or Wichita. - No... - He is right, Davey. You're wastin' your time. There isn't a decent white woman within... Yeah. Oh, come on, Davey. You're not leavin' town, are you? Look, if I wanna go, I go. I wanna stay, I stay. - Didn't I tell you? - Well, I'm your friend, boy. Like you was Ritchy's friend. That's a type who should never drink. Are you in a bad mood, Mr. Higgens? - That Jack Tillman... - Oh. Send him into that rathole across the street, and he stays there. Probably tellin' those saddle tramps how nice they are. What we need in this town is some force. We can't just go on and on. Oh, I like this. But I don't think red is good for her. Do you have the same size in other color? Blue dots. Oh, blue is good. I think she's going to look so beautiful in blue. Do you have a ribbon to match? I'll get the ribbon. Here's the ribbon. You see if they match. So nice. She'll be the best-dressed little girl in Kansas City. Would you wrap this in a nice box and send it for me? Of course. Like to send a letter along? Oh, yes, a letter. But you have to wait until tomorrow. And I will have the letter ready for you. All right? I'll have it packed real nice. That's good. Well, goodbye, Mr. Higgens. Oh. I... I came to settle up. Thank you. Oh, I... I thought I'd like to have another treatment, ma'am. Does your side still bother you, Mr. Robles? Well, I'd like to have you look at it. Why don't you sit down and wait for the doctor? He should be back soon. Is... Is the doc your man? - I work for him. - Oh. Right now I'm going to make his dinner. Excuse me. Oh, are these your living quarters? The patients are treated out here. Well... here I am. All right. Take off your shirt. Yes, ma'am. - Sit down. - Oh. Let me see. You're quite a man. - Thank you, ma'am. - Oh, yes. Any man who can kill in the morning and still think of love, that is quite a man. That's very nice of you. But I would have to do one or the other, kill or love. Love. And I do not feel in the mood for love! You walk out of the room. And then we both laugh. All right. All right, boys, the sheriff wants to go to his office. - All right, sheriff. - All right, sheriff. Come here, Sheriff! - You're my meat, boy! Come on! - This way! Come on, Bannister, join in the fun! No, I don't want to. Bannister, can't you stop those rowdies? What can I do? You stop 'em. No, please... Sheriff, you look good up there. Is that what your friends call sport? I've seen it before. All right, Billy, it's your first shot. Just a nick, no head. Oh, that's too easy. Too easy? Maybe it is. Please let me down! Let me down, Fred! Now you've got a swinging target. You missed the head! Stop it! Just stop it! Cowards! What happened with you people in this town? Let go! Let go! Guys, look what I found. Hey! Chiquita? Let me go! Hey, George, what do you say we take her with us? - She's a wild cat! - Yeah! Hold her, Billy! Let me go! Let me go! Hey, Billy. Hey, Billy, come on. Come on, Billy. - Get her out of here. - Come on. Let's go and get some more whiskey. I'll give you a chance to win your $5 back. I don't want them. I'd rather have that girl. Come on, Billy, put her down. - Let go and drink some more. - Get out of here! Come on, Billy, put her down. Poncho said put her down! Billy, I said put her down. I put her down, senor, so my gun arm is free. You... You wanna draw, George? Be careful! Pull him down. Jack! Oh, Jack, what have they done to you? What have they done to you? Oh, what kind of man are you? How can you do this to a human being? Jack! Please help me to take him to the doc office. Do you have any more games we can play, Bannister? She didn't even thank you, did she? Come on inside, have another drink. Can't have everything, boy. I've got a lot to offer you, boy. What, some more fellas to shoot? Look, you've had a big day. Dan Ritchy. Fred Jasper. Billy Dawson. Yes, sir, a big day. Two more, I'd have a poker hand. Robles, you killed three men today. Three I was planning to use here in Mesa, but I don't care. You killed them, that makes you better. What I do care about is getting you to throw in with me. Davey... I was a gunfighter long enough to learn one thing. Either you die young, or you grow old and end up broke. But not me. I plan to wind up alive and rich. Are you listening? Oh, yeah. Yeah. You've seen the town, Davey. It was a big one, once. All the cowherds came here from Texas. And they started going west, to Ellsworth, and east, to Wichita. Mesa wound up in the middle, with no trade. You think this town's finished? Just a few ranches around, just a few stores in town. Well, it's not finished. Not after I take it over. Do you hear me, boy? Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. You talk loud. In Ellsworth and Wichita, they got the law. They made those Texas cowhands walk a straight line. But there's no law here. A man could take all those closed-up buildings, put a saloon, or a dance hall in every one of them. I'd get that Texas trade from Ellsworth and Wichita. They'd all come to a wide open town, their pockets full of trail money. But I'm old. I need a fast gun to back me up. Like Richie's, or Dawson's. - Or yours, Davey boy. Why, we could... Come on, Davey. Wake up, boy. Wake up, Davey boy. Come on, wake up. Fixed you some good eggs. I don't like the way my stomach feels. You had a nice nap. Now for some nice food. You know, Ed, you should have been a mother. Well, you got to eat something, boy. I... I think I'm gonna need me some fresh air. What about my offer? What? About throwing in with me. Oh. You know, I like your whiskey... I'm not so sure I like you. Go ahead. Go find some more big names to kill! And if you don't get gunned down, you're gonna grow old, and see how glory tastes when you're hungry. I could make you a fortune, you fool. I could set you up for life! Well, thanks for letting me bunk here. Wait till you grow old. Wait till you're slowed down just a fraction of a second. Then you'll wish you'd used your head to make your speed pay off when you had it. Evening, Breezy. Is the town always this dead at night? Oh! Oh, Mr. Robles. Oh, no, no. Not like this. Most everybody's down at the town hall. Higgens called a meeting. Say... Doc's housekeeper, what's her name? Estella. Estella? She gone to the town meeting, too? No. No, no, no. She's probably down at the doc's. Mr. Robles, is there anything I can do for you? Anything at all? I got your horse all saddled up and ready for you over at the stable, just in case you want to... Thanks, Breezy. - Easy, Jack. - I'll be all right. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye. We're leaving Mesa as soon as we can pack our things. I weigh this as a blessing, trying to get Jack out of here alive. Bye, Estella. Goodbye, Mrs. Tillman. Thank you so much for your help. Goodbye. Doc, can I fix your supper? I've lost my appetite. I'd better get over to the town meeting and listen to Roy Higgens spout off about law and order. - You wanna listen? - No, Doc. I'm going to clean the office. You go get the scissors, I'll wait for you. Ain't you invited to their meetings? Their meetings are my meetings. If I want to go, I go. I don't want to go. Okay. I'm surprised you're still in town. Oh, I'm just staying around to keep you from getting lonesome. I thank you for what you did this afternoon. I thank you for helping me and helping Mr. Tillman. But do not expect more than that. Estella. I came to say goodbye. Goodbye. Let me give you a hand. How long have you been here? Four years. - Why? - Why not? I don't know. Why should a deer wanna join a herd of buffalo? I like it here. I belong here. I have chosen Mesa. Fine choice. And where do you belong? Oh, I belonged once in Del Rio. Until four men with four guns taught me you can't be safe anywhere. As long as you're weak. And now you're strong? And with this, I'm the strongest. I paid them back. With this, I can belong anywhere. With this, I could make a life for you. For me? A woman like you doesn't belong in a dead place like this. I could take you to Dodge, Wichita... Even Kansas City. And that gun would make us both belong? No, thank you. I have been to those places. I have had excitement you're speaking of. You're just scared of a little fun, that's all. Yes. Yes! I am plenty scared of your kind, Mr. Robles. Four years ago, I was married to a man like you. A man with a gun. We have a child in Wichita. And then one day, my husband was killed by a gun. Justice? For him, maybe. But what about us? We were left without a gun to protect us. So you ride on, Mr. Robles. But you ride on alone. And if you have any decency, you stay alone. You have a kid? Yes. In Kansas City. With her father's brother and his wife. They are very nice people. She will be here one day. I earn money. Soon, I can buy a place. But more important, I earn a place here. I earn respect. Well... Adios, Linda. Mr. Robles. Mr. Robles. Oh, Breezy. Here. Here, for the horse. Oh, much obliged. But I've come to get you for them at the town hall. What? Yeah, they asked me if you were still in town, I said yes. They asked me to ask you to come to meet them. - Are you sure they want me? - That's what they said. You... You gonna go and see what they want? Well, why not? Sure, why not? Look, if you're tired and you wanna stay overnight, I can get you a room at the hotel. And unless you keep your wits and figure everything out with some logic, then you might as well blow up the whole town! I agree with that, Doc. It's a bad decision, I don't like it, - ballot or no ballot! - May I say something? Let Mrs. Higgens talk. Maybe I shouldn't say anything, but I don't think we should have a man like this in our community. Mrs. Higgens is right! Don't argue. Don't argue. Let's decide it via vote. Quiet! Quiet, please! I'm very sorry my wife doesn't agree with me, but we've taken a vote. No matter what Doc thinks, we've got to... Come on, Sue. I, I understand you want to talk to me. Indeed we do, Mr. Robles. Won't you come up here, please? Mr. Robles, we'd like to persuade you to stay on here in Mesa. As a town official. - Town official? - That's right. It takes fire to fight fire. And, since you've proved you can handle Bannister and his friends, you are the man we want. Am I right? Isn't he? We'd like to offer you the job of sheriff. We'll pay $100 a month. And the use of the living quarters back at the jail. Now, how does that sound? Well, it sounds fine. Except that jail part. Then, you'll accept? Why not? It's a... It's quite an honor. I mean, a fella like me doesn't usually expect an honor like this. It's... Congratulations, Sheriff. - Yeah. - Congratulations, Sheriff. Here's your badge. Oh. Wh... Where does it go? Over the heart, Mr. Robles. On the left. Here? How's it look? Mighty fine, Sheriff. Now, let's see, you'll need an outfit to go with that. Yeah, something fancy? Yes. Pants, vest and, coat. How's this? Yeah, that's fine. Now, how can I write if you pace around like that? What are you putting down? Just what you said. But either I write slow, or no one can read it. Oh, if I can only write in English. You'd save me a lot of time. "I hope the dress fits you, and I know how lovely you will look." What's next, my dear? Is that good? I mean, "lovely"? Maybe it should be "beautiful." No, I think lovely's all right. And, "All my love for you, my darling." - And... - No, wait. Wait. Please. And? And "God bless you." "God bless you." - There. - Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Good morning, Breezy. Oh. Morning. Good morning. Doc. Doc... It's my heart. I felt a little shaky when I woke up this morning. You know... they say whiskey can help a man's heart. So you want to drink? Well... Well, what do you think? I think it would help my heart. Yes, sir, I truly do. - This kind? - Yeah, that's the kind. Breezy, stay out of my desk. And out of my liquor closet. Two days ago, this bottle was half-full. Now it's only a quarter. I found it and hid it in my office. You sneaked into my house yesterday, didn't you? Oh, no, Doctor. No. No, I wouldn't do a thing like that. - While I was here, you wouldn't. - No. But I'm here now. That's why you had to ask me. Well, you asked. Now get out. Oh, now, Doc... - You got me... - Out, Breezy, and stay out. Oh, Doc... You know, they... They pinch a little. They'll loosen up. No, this gets in the way. How does it look? It's the latest style. Those sleeves could be a little longer. Yeah. How about some hats? Yeah. Right over there. Help yourself. I'll alter this vest. - Mr. Higgens. - Hey. How do I look? Like a gambler. All you need is a pack of cards. Yeah? How do you like this one? Much better. Are you always this happy in the morning? Why not? I have a new job, I make a lot of money. You have a new job? Hey, why didn't you stay at the meeting last night? I kind of expected your congratulations. Congratulations. Mr. Higgens, here's the letter. Now you can send the dress. I'll put this with it and get it off right away. Thank you very much. Good day, Mr. Sheriff. Here, I'll take this one. - You want to pay for it? - Put it on the books? Hey, Estella! Hey. Is that a nice way to treat the new sheriff? How about you walk me to my office? I think you'll be able to find it alone. You are a man who can do anything, as long as you have a gun. Hey, are you mad because I took the job, No, I don't feel angry, Mr. Robles. I just feel sorry for you. Maybe I want some respect, too. You know, it took you four years. It only took me one day. - Do you really think you have respect? - Well... Only because you get $100 a month? Your gun has respect, not you. But for how long? Oh, I don't know, as long as Ed Bannister's around. That is right. Until you clean this town up. Did you ever clean a house of rats? What's that? You throw a snake inside and you shut the door. But when the rats are gone, you don't keep the snake around for company. Hey! Hey, Estella! Morning, Sheriff. Hi, Ed. Oh, come on, Ed, you're gonna scratch the furniture. I can't figure you out, Robles. Either you're a fool, like I said, or a very clever man. You take one, I'll take the other? I was kind of surprised to hear that you'd taken this job. Then I began to wonder, it would be a good deal for both of us. Yeah, you've been doing a lot of thinking? You know what, Ed? I think you're crazy. Why did you take it? Oh, I don't know, I'm a sort of devoted man. You know, law and order. What do you plan to do? I don't know. I had a shave, bought me some new clothes. Well, I guess I'll get me some breakfast. You know a good place? I mean, about me. You know they're all waiting for you to run me out of town. Yeah. Are you gonna try? No, Ed. I wouldn't try it. If I wanted to, I would. You couldn't have shined my boots ten years ago. Yeah, I know. You were a tiger. Ed, you tell your friends they can come to town, drink all they want? But tell them to stay off the streets. I'll tell them. But I'll let them give you their answers. Howdy. Afternoon. What's all the trimmings for? Big dance tonight, about the only one we have all year. Should be real nice. Mr. Robles. You must have left early. We went by to see you. I, guess you're taking a little time, getting used to your job. Well, I rode out to the neighboring ranches, thought I'd better let them know who I am. Well, of course. That's fine, but... What about Bannister? Well, what about him? Well, he is still over there. Now, you hired me to be Sheriff, right? That's right. Well, I'm gonna do the best job I can. Now, I don't think it's smart to get rid of Ed Bannister right away. You see, I... I have an idea... But that's silly. I mean, when Bannister leaves, so does trouble. All right. I say it's dangerous to have him around. Well, now, the only thing you have to worry about is Ed Bannister's friends. Now, as long as I'm around, they won't bother you. See? Well, I'll see you at the dance tonight, gentlemen. Leave your hats and wraps on the table. They'll be safe. Thank you. Good evening, Sheriff. Sheriff... Town rule, no guns allowed at the dance. Oh. Well, I wouldn't want to break the town rule. Thanks. Sheriff, the hat. If you just follow my instructions, I'm sure your daughter will be all right, Mrs. Jones. - Hi, Doc. - Good evening, Robles. - She's a fine girl. - Nice crowd? I've never figured a crowd to be nice. Just big. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Whoever made this punch should be shot. Is it bad? Well, it ain't good. - Excuse me. - Certainly. Oh, look, I ain't danced in a long time. Would you like to take a chance? I'm sorry, I have promised this dance. Next one? It's taken, too. Well, the same fella? No, I have many friends. Maybe later. Now. I say later. Mr. Brown, this is Mr. Robles. - Oh, how do you do? - Hi. I understand you were by our ranch this afternoon. I'm sorry I missed you. You should have stayed home. Mr. Brown, this is your dance. Oh, evening, Mr. Higgens. Evening, Sheriff. Oh, this little woman? Yes, it is. You mind if we dance? I'm sorry, but I promised my wife some punch. - Excuse me. - Certainly. Well, I see Mr. Robles realized he wasn't welcome. He'd have to be blind not to have seen it. Just because we hired him as Sheriff, doesn't mean we have to accept him socially, Doctor. Oh, I see. He's good enough to do your killing for you, but it has to be on the other side of the street. You leaving so soon, Sheriff? Yeah, I think I'll go and get me some fresh air. Evening, Breezy. Oh! Good evening, Sheriff. - Nice crowd in there? - Yeah. Nice crowd. You got a drink, Breezy? Me? No. Yeah, label looks familiar. Oh, you know... Well, the truth is, that's really mine to share. I left it with Tillman, you know, to take care of it for me. I wouldn't take anything if it wasn't mine. It's all right, Breezy, share and share alike. You're a very understanding man. Sure. Was you in the army, Breezy? Cavalry. You know, I once had 50 men under my command. I bet you don't even believe in my plan, do you? Oh, I believe you, Breezy. Why aren't you inside, dancing, Sheriff? I don't like the refreshments, Breezy. Yeah. Breezy. Thank you, Sheriff. Hey... Well, you know, as my daddy always used to say... "When a bottle's dead, go to bed." Yeah. Will you play something lively, please? Davey. Why do you insist on staying in Mesa? They begged me to stay, remember? Don't you have any pride? Can't you see they don't want you? Oh, we're even. I don't want them. They can keep their watered-down lemonades and their fat wives. Davey, I understand your feelings... No, you don't. No, you don't. You eat dirt, you bounce great. You see, I don't care whether they want me or not. I'm staying. I'm staying 'til I'm ready to go. All right! Stay here! Wait for more of Bannister's friends. Kill them, one at a time. Then we can thank you in our evening prayers. We can thank David Robles, our killer who kills for us. You... You really want me to go, don't you? - Yes. - Why? You think I'm not good enough for this town? Yes, I like Mesa the way it was. Before you and your gun changed it. Because you felt pure. And I come along, you don't feel so pure anymore. You know what? You're just afraid of being a woman. I want you? Don't you? Do you think I want a man who is proud to be a killer? I was married to a man like you. Wh... What do you know about me? Wh... Why do you think I'm staying here? Why do you think I took the job? For a tin badge? For a lousy $100? Estella... Estella, I'm staying here because of you. And what will I be? Another notch on your gun? Something you can brag about in the saloon when you get drunk? You're blind. Go on. Go on back in there and try to forget how you feel. Only remember one thing, I know. Bannister! Mr. Bannister! Well... I wanna buy a bottle. - What are you looking at? - You. You're drunk. So? I'm a little old, and you're a little drunk. So I am drunk. I'm just wondering, maybe that whiskey slowed you down a bit. Why don't you just drag the gun out and find out, Ed? You know, I could be half-dead and still take you. Why don't you take your gun off? I'd like to kill you with my bare hands. Are you man enough to fight that way? I always said you was a little crazy. Just... Come on around here. All right, get it over with. Oh, you're right, Ed. Maybe it's more fun with your fists. Only, I mean it. - Good night, Doc. - Thanks, Ken, you did a good job. - Good night, Doc. - Night, folks. Just take it easy, Robles. What are you doing? I said take it easy. I just set your wrist. You're lucky you're out. You set my wrist? That's right. It was broken. Doc. Doc, I can't move my fingers. Doc, what does it mean? What do you mean? My wrist... Will I be able to... Can you draw a gun and shoot a man? You know the answer. But, Doc, I... I got... You're no longer a gun fighter, Robles. You're just a cripple cowboy, and the sooner you realize it, the better off you'll be. Don't wrap around the hand. Suppose you keep out of my business. I want that bandage to stay tight. I don't want it to show. Just wrap around the wrist. You're hoping with your shirt sleeve button nobody can tell your wrist is bandaged, right? Not unless you tell them. Doc, you won't tell them, will you? I've got no reason to do that. Since you'll be leaving town tomorrow morning. Maybe this was for the best. The very best, Robles. For you and Mesa. - Morning, Sheriff. - Morning, Breezy. I... was thinking, Sheriff, I'd like to do you a favor. - Yeah? - I... I heard Bannister talking. Oh, he's plenty sore about that beating you gave him last night. But he's expecting more friends of his in town tomorrow. More than you can handle. This information free, Breezy? Well, I... I thought you'd appreciate it. You know, any consideration you wanna make. Say, a dollar? What about that bottle last night? Oh, yeah. Well, let's just call it a favor, then. Well, order some more of your brand, Doc. At least it'll last me for a while, Roy. Yes, sir. Fourteen men. Why, in my day, no matter where I rolled, there was a... - Friend of yours? - A new one. Just rode in this morning. It's a nice, friendly little town. Yes, very friendly. Where you headed for, kid? Anywhere. Took up a room at a hotel for a day or two of rest. You are... Must be Dave Robles. That's right. Get out, kid. I said get out. Well, thanks for the drink. It's 9:30, Ed. I can tell time. That's good. 'Cause I want him to leave town by noon. You know, Ed, someday you're gonna make the mistake and draw on me. That's a single-action gun, Ed. I hear it click, you're a dead man. - Doc. - Dave. What are you doing in there? I'm gonna carry you out in a box if you don't leave town. You know that boy? I know what's on his mind. - What's your name, kid? - Danny Sheridan. You a southpaw? How many men have you killed? Two. Well, then you're ready for the big time. You know, you kill a big name, then you're a big name yourself. That's what you want, isn't it, kid? Yeah. Draw. - You're kidding. - Oh, come on. I'm giving you a chance to take my name. There. - Listen, now... - Come on, draw. Look, I don't want you hanging around, wondering... Stop! You shouldn't have tried that. It had to be done. I might have to reset the wrist. Let's go to my office. Let me see that. That hurt? Not as much now. Well, I don't think we'll have to reset it. But you'd better wake up, man. You can't stay around like this with a broken wrist. After Bannister leaves... then I can leave. Who said Bannister was leaving? I told him to. Dave, why don't you stop fooling yourself? When word gets out about this, you're gonna be the target for every gun-happy kid in the country. - Yep. - Dave, you... Well, it's your own life. Don't worry, Doc. I'm going to live it as long as I can. Breezy. Oh. Hi, Doc. You always come in the door backwards? Oh! No, I... I changed my mind. I don't know, I don't feel sick. You're pretty good, as a matter of fact. So long, Doc. You think he was here all the time? I'm afraid so. Some whiskey was missing, and knowing Breezy, I... Yeah. I thought I'd better come over and tell you so you could do something about it. Oh, Doc, I didn't know you was here. - Oh, hello, Sheriff. - Hiya, Breezy. I... I... Oh, excuse me, I... I brought you word from Ed Bannister. What kind of word, Breezy? Well, Ed says that he ain't gonna leave town like you told him to. Instead, he says you better leave town. That if you can't argue the point with him, he says he'll meet you in the street in ten minutes. I thought you'd wanna know what he said, Sheriff. Breezy, last night we drank together. You know, I thought we was friends. Well... I don't take sides, you understand. It's just, I gotta make a living. And Ed, he can take care of me. Well, at least he gave you a break. You've got plenty of time to leave town. I'll see that Ken has your horse saddled. Never mind. You are leaving? - Get out, Doc. - But, Dave, I... Leave me alone, Doc. Hey, Breezy. Look at that old barrel shine. - There's a real gun. - That it is, Ed. Sure you told everybody to be there? Yeah, I... I told Higgens, Smithy, everyone I saw. Some of them just left. Yeah? Well, they won't be laughing after 10:00. What do you mean? Oh, you wouldn't shoot Robles down in cold blood, would you? He won't be fool enough to show up. I wanna show this town who's top man. That's me from now on. Yeah, well, whatever you say, Ed. What do you want? Another slap in the face? With your broken wrist? Dave, Doc told me. This one isn't broken. David, last night you told me you love me in your way. Now I tell you my way. Why did you walk away, then? I don't want to share you with a gun. David, I want you. A man who can't defend himself? You can leave with the pride in yourself, not a gun. Please, David, come with me. They paid me to do a job. I didn't do it. They hired a gun, and the gun is dead. $100 is not worth dying with. You can't make a life by... By running away. Yes. Let me show you, David. Please give me a chance. I already told Ken to saddle your horse, and one for me. We can go to a place. Any place. And we can make a good place for you, for me and for my daughter. Please, David, come with me. Hurry up, David, please. Come, David. - Do they know I'm running? - It is not important they know. Good morning, Sheriff. I guess you're gonna take a little ride. Don't listen, David. Come on, David. Please! Go on, clear out! One of us has to leave. I plan on staying. Go, get the horses. I'll wait here. You wait here. Right here. Where are you sending her, Robles? To get more help? Don't pay attention, David. Don't pay attention to him, David. Please. You're through ordering men around. From now on, you can give your orders to women. David! No! - No! - Estella! - Let me go! - Estella! Did you lie to me, you scoundrel? I told you you'd make a mistake, Ed. - Come on, draw. - You paid him. You paid him to get me into this. You'd never walk down here if... Come on, Ed, draw. It's not fair. You know you can beat me. It's not fair. It was fair as long as you thought I was crippled, Come on, Ed. Draw. No. No, you don't wanna kill me, Davey. Please. You better go, Ed. You bet on the wrong man, Breezy.
