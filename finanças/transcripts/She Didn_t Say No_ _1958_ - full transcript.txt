SCOIL NÁISIÚNTA, DÚN DOON NATIONAL SCHOOL 1882 "Such harmonious madness from my lips would flow. The world would listen then, as I am listening now". Very nice. Poppy Monaghan. We Are Seven by William Wordsworth. Go on, Poppy. "I met a little cottage girl and she was eight years old, she said. Her hair was thick with... with... With many a curl... That clustered round her head. 'Sisters and brothers, little maid, how many may you be?' 'How many? Seven in all', she said..." That's us! Oh? The rest of us, like the ones in the poem. - We are seven. - I see, there's six more like you? Not like me, but more. There's Mary, she's done school. Tommy too. That's Betty and Bridie. Ah twins, I see. That's very nice. Yes, we've got the only twins in the village. But that only makes six, including Poppy and yourself. It's seven, I counted! Seven with Mummy! - Oh yes, yes, of course. - Sit down, Daniel. My name's Toughy. Toughy Monaghan. She doesn't never call me Daniel neither, only in front of you. Everyone calls me Toughy because I'm tough. Sit down, Toughy. He's not my brother, he's only my half-brother. It counts! Tell her it counts! So you're a sister to the twins, Poppy? No, I'm not, I'm only half-sister to them. And to Mary and to Tommy. We're all only half, except the twins. Oh, but surely you have-- You can have your break now, children. Poppy was quite right. They've all got the same mother. - Ah, they're nice children. - Yes. The only thing against them is that they shouldn't be there at all. Oh, I see. I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong about Bridget Monaghan. I remember her at school here. She was a gentle, pretty girl, but a dreamer. She lived in a world away from Doon, a world of her own that was full of romance. And she never came out of it? She still thought that every man was a knight in shining armour. But they're not. I'm afraid not. Are they local men? Not Mary's father, she's the eldest. Bridget met him in Waterford during the war, it seems. But all the others belong to Doon. None of them has ever admitted it, of course, but it's well known. In a place like this, everything's known. - How's the wife, William? - Oh, nothing yet. But the midwife sent for the doctor half an hour ago. He's upstairs now. It's a boy you'll be wanting, I suppose, to help you with the round? I'll be well content with whatever providence He's fit to send. I never got such a shock in my life, Doctor. But it's nothing to what William Bates'll get when you tell him. I'll be lucky if I don't have the father on my hands as well as the mother. If you paid more attention to your own business and less to everyone else's, you'd be a better nurse. Thirteen and four pence, like I said. I thought you might be giving a discount, a great day like today. I might have a family to be looking after now, Jamesy. Well, William. You're a proud father. Thank you, Doctor. Thanks for everything. Why don't you come to Dermody's later to wet the baby's head? The wife wanted a girl. Is it a boy? Well, er... Ah, it's a girl, so. Her mother had her own way in the end. Well, not exactly... In the name of goodness, Doctor, what have we got? Twins. "No, Doctor, not twins!" says William, going white as a sheet! But sure the whole village knew already that William Bates was the father of the Monaghan twins. His wife didn't, Sergeant Dempsey, but she knows now! Ach, isn't he the unfortunate, poor man? Your cousin William, Sergeant, is doing his best for his sadly underpopulated country. You're in no position to be cracking that kind of joke, Jamesy Casey! Easy now, ma'am, we can all make mistakes. There's living proof that some of us can, anyway. 'Tis easy for a bachelor to keep a grin on his face. Make mine a pint, Mick. I'm all keeled out. You're right. William should be here now, standing to us all like a lord. Aye, and doubles at that. I knew we were in for trouble the moment I set eyes on the new young Bateses. Two fine little girls, just like Bridget Monaghan's. The school inspector couldn't know me from her. Or her from me. - But he liked us both! - But he liked us both! I'm sure you all did very well. I did very well. - Him, Mammy, he just talked-- - And talked. I talked very well. Of course you did, pet. Now drink up all your milk so you grow up to be a fine, strong man. Poppy, dear, you've hardly eaten a thing. I must think of my figure. - Why? - All film stars do. - You're not a film star. - Not yet. You'd be a funny-looking film star. They're sort of... Sort of bigger. Different faces too, Poppy, my girl. You only think that because you're used to mine. Some day, you'll be reading all about me in the papers. Then you'll be going round saying to everyone, "That's Poppy, our Poppy". Well, I'll be getting back to the digging before it rains. If I get a job with a farmer, I won't have time to do much here. I was thinking maybe I'd try a winter crop of beans. Beans would be lovely, Tommy. I could try a lot of things, if only we had a decent-sized bit of land. Your new potatoes were wonderful this year, Tommy. Mother... Ah, sure they're only very small spoonfuls, Mary. I know, Mother. Well, we'll settle the grocer's bill at the end of the week maybe. And how in the world are my two little piggies? Here comes Maggie Murphy. She can't be wanting a new dress already. The last one you made fitted beautifully, Mother. Yes, I know, dear. But somehow when I'm working for her, my heart isn't in it. Come in, Maggie. Good day to you both. Would you mind running your tape measure over me, Bridget? I have your measurements, Maggie. Maybe I've got slimmer. I suppose you've heard the great news about William Bates. - You mean the baby's arrived? - That's only half the story. It's twins. The moment I saw the two little darlings, I thought of you, Bridget. I knew you'd be interested. So you didn't come for a new dress after all. And we're not interested. Strange, now. I thought you would be. Never mind, Mother. But that was years ago, Martha, long before I met you. Everyone's forgotten now. With this day's work, the whole world'll remember. But they're very nice babies. They're lovely babies. Now look what you've done! They do cry rather a lot, don't they? Well might they cry for the shame that lies before them. Growing up to be the butt and joke of every corner boy in Doon. Half-sisters to the children of that... That... Something will have to be done. But it's rather late now, Martha. Besides, I don't see what I can do. I tell you, something will have to be done. That woman and her tribe must be cleared out of the place. It should've been done long since. I'm not going to have my children to be growing up to be encountering these Monaghans wherever they walk: in the church, in the street, in the schoolroom. But those two will've left school before our two start going there. Don't argue with me. I don't care how you do it, - but get rid of them you will. - But how, Martha? If you're not man enough to do it yourself, go and get that cousin of yours to help you. - Which one? - The sergeant, the civic guard you're always blowing about, of course. And don't take all night about it either! I'm sorry I couldn't come yesterday, Mrs Power, but William Bates being the father of twins kept me pretty busy. It doesn't matter. I said it wasn't urgent. What did you want to see me about? You ought to have told me the truth long ago, Doctor. The truth about what? I went to the clinic in Dublin last week. The doctor there told me I could never have a child. It's a pity you had to hear it from anyone. You ought to have told me, Dr Cassidy, saved me hearing it from a stranger. Since nothing could be done, there was no point in talking about it. The whole town knows about Jim. Mrs Power, there's always gossip in a place like this. Sometimes it's true, more often it isn't. It's true enough the man I married's the father of Bridget Monaghan's youngest. I hoped that as soon as we had children of our own, he'd forget. Now I... Hello, boy! Come here. Come on. That's a good boy. Yippee! Toughy is the cowboy king! Come on! Come on and have a bite! Come on! Come on! Come on and have a bite! I hope your father gives you the worst whipping of your life for this! - He won't. - Why not? Because I haven't got a father. Look, blood! Ah, she's all right. No bones broken. She's a good dog, I'll give her my apple. She doesn't eat apples. Here, you'd better take yourself off home. Maybe this'll teach you not to go into a field with a bull again. I only wanted to pat the bull's head. He's a very stupid bull. I wouldn't make a habit of patting bulls on the head. Even at your age you ought to have more sense. I have a lot of sense, but I'm tough. - I chase bulls. - Well, that bull chased you. He chased you too. It's not a disgrace to be chased by a bull, is it? It's a disgrace to annoy any animal. That's not tough, it's just plain silly. Here, you'd better come on to my house and have a wash before you go home. I don't want to wash, but I'd like to see your house. All right, come on. - Hungry? - Yes. Well, we'll see if we can get you a bite to eat. Thanks. - Where do you live? - Along the road. A long way along. You're small to be out on your own. - What's your name? - Toughy Monaghan. Well! Well, you've grown! The last time I saw you, - you were just a little-- - Jim! Jim! Here. Here, take that and be off. But I'm going to your house. Go on! Take your shilling an be off! And don't come round here again, or I'll set the dog on you. That's what I do to boys that interfere with my animals. I didn't mean to make your bull cross. Take your shilling and clear off. And don't let me catch you round here again. All right, but if I was a farmer, I wouldn't keep a bad bull. And I don't want your shilling! Mother won't let us take money, but anyway I wouldn't have it. Now be sure and save a nice, big piece for Toughy, darling. Wonder where he's got to? You didn't seem to enjoy your birthday party, Poppy. Didn't you like your cake, dear? It's a very nice cake, Mammy. But I've something on my mind. Oh dear, you're not in trouble at school again now are you? It's something more important than school. Mammy, I'm grown up now. I should be told the truth. - Am I a foundling? - A what, dear? Did you find me abandoned somewhere? Maybe with a gold locket around my neck? - Maybe with diamond initials on it. - Well, not exactly, dear, no. Mary knows her father was killed in the war, and Tommy knows his is old Jamesy Casey. Today I should be told the truth about myself. Now Mary and Tommy are older than you are, Poppy. Mammy, tell me, don't be afraid. I've always guessed I couldn't just have an ordinary father like the others. Well, he's fairly ordinary, dear. Who is he? If you won't tell me, I'll find out for myself. I'll go round the whole village asking everyone I meet. It'll take a long time, but somebody's bound to say yes in the end. Now that wouldn't be at all the polite thing to do, Poppy. I'll have to do it if you drive me to it. I didn't know this was worrying you so much. All right, I'll tell you now and we'll never talk about it again. It's... It's Mr Hogan at the newspaper shop. Him? I'd much rather be a foundling. Where are you going, Poppy? Oh, just for a walk. "To be or not to be, - that is the question". - Matthew. "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of..." Matthew, you're wanted. Must you interrupt me at such a moment? I think you'd better come. Can you never understand how it feels to be dragged into the petty commerce of everyday life? Well it's not exactly commerce at the moment, Matthew, it's Poppy Monaghan. What do you want, child? Don't you know me, Daddy? I'm Poppy, your long-lost daughter. - Who sent you here? - No one. I thought you'd like to see me, Daddy. I thought you'd be lonely for me. Oh Daddy, can't we all be happy together? Mammy's heart is breaking, her cheeks are growing pale. She gets thinner every day. She's waiting. She never tells me what she's waiting for, but I know. She sits by the window all day, waiting for you. Or could it be to catch the light for her sewing, Poppy? If you don't come soon, she'll be lying cold and dead, Daddy. Stop calling me that ridiculous name! "Daddy"? Is it so absurd, Matthew? Here... - That's what you were sent for. - You're a fool, Matthew. You must be quite well off. I suppose I'm your heir. Goodbye, Auntie. My name is Miss Hogan. - But I'm your niece. - I can't help that. For poor little Toughy. That'll be two and three. - Would Daddy really want me to pay? - Two and three, please. One and eleven pence, Miss Hogan. - Has that horrible child gone? - Matthew, she's your daughter. It was all Bridget Monaghan's doing. Oh? She must be a most unusual woman. How can you sit there calmly joking and knitting like Madame Defarge at the guillotine? Well, you certainly lost your head when you gave that pound to your daughter. She'll be back for more before the week's out. I know. I know all too well: that woman means to bleed me white. You know quite well Bridget Monaghan's not that sort of a woman. She wouldn't have waited 12 years if she were. I've always admired her pride and independence. Oh, that child, that terrible child. What have I done to deserve this? - You should know. - Oh! Yahoo! You're dead for the rest of your life! I hope you've got a licence for that gun you're after killing me with. - Is your mother in? - Yes. Come in. - Ah, good day to you, Sergeant. - Good day, ma'am. I'm afraid I'm here on a bit of official business. Oh? It's my duty to serve you personally with this summons, which I now have done. Oh dear, has the goat been straying again? I'd advise you to read it, ma'am. Oh no! What does it mean, Sergeant? It's an order for one Bridget Monaghan, spinster of Doon parish in the County Wexford, to appear at the next sitting of Doon Court to determine whether or not she is a fit and proper person to have custody of her children. - But... - I'm sorry, ma'am. How could you do this terrible thing to us, Sergeant? You've known us all our lives. It's not me, it's the law. At this moment, you could say that in a personal capacity, I don't really exist at all. But... Oh, you're white. I thought you were a red Indian. Their tents are different: wigwams. Think I could get a little water at your house? A trapper should be able to find his own. I'm only a painter. Pictures? That's bad. We've got water. Come on, I'll show you the trail. Come on. He's from the tent. He wants water. - I'll fill it for you. - I don't want to bother you. If you show me where the well is, I won't need to trouble you again. It's all right, it's just here. Would you like me to boil the kettle for you? Oh, thank you very much. My oil stove was all right when I bought it yesterday, now it just roars and turns red. I can show you how to manage it. I'm sorry for coming to your house in that moment. No, no, please let me say what I wanted to say. I heard the talk in Darmody's pub last night, so I guessed what was happening here when I saw the Sergeant leaving. I'd rather not talk about it. Don't you think it helps sometimes? I don't know, I've never tried. Try now. I'll be here only for a few weeks and then you'll never see me again, so you won't be looking at me in the future and wishing you'd kept quiet. Thank you, but I simply can't talk about it. Can't you find the words? We're friends? - I'm Peter Howard. - I'm Mary Monaghan. Mary Monaghan. This is a very gaudy looking tree here. It's a wishing well. It's called the Rag Well. You tie a rag to the thorn and your wish comes true within a year. Well, here's our chance. It's only paint. You mustn't tell your wish, you know. I wasn't going to yet. I can guess yours. Do you think they can take the children away? I haven't much respect for the law, but it can hardly be as bad as that. I hope not. But I'm afraid. - Good morning, Bridget. - Good morning, Jamesy. I'm sorry to hear about your trouble. Ah sure, I knew you would have nothing to do with it, Jamesy. I wouldn't lend myself to persecuting a widow and the orphan, in a manner of speaking. Indeed I want to lighten the load for you. It's late in the day for you or any of your kind to think of doing that. Why sure isn't it better late than never? - I hear Tommy's looking for a job. - Yes, he is. Well, I might have an opening for him. Mother, it wouldn't be suitable. Shall we go a little apart and talk about it? Here, wait a minute. - There you are. - Thank you, Jamesy. Well, what do you say? Well, I was told you couldn't get a boy anywhere. You've had five in the past year. It's supposed to be a very hard place, yours. You're not afraid of hard work, are you? No, not when there's something to show for it, but yours is bad land. Now if those marshy fields were to get a new layout of drainage, and the three-acre field was to-- Look, I'm not asking you to run my farm for me, only to work on it. Tommy's a good boy. You pay poor wages. Small wages, for a start. It's my way. It wouldn't be suitable at any wage. Now you're very set against us, aren't you? There's good reason. There are people who might've been expected to help us and they never did. I'm glad they didn't. I'd sooner take a penny off the poorest beggar on the road than have anything to do with one of those people. Mary, love... Ah, well lately there's been thoughts coming into my head that never bothered me before. Maybe it is the years starting to tell. Sure, you're only in your prime, Jamesy. Ah, there's times, though, I say to myself, "Jamesy Casey," I say, "what are you slaving away for day after day, trying to hold your few acres together? And you without either kith or kin to carry on after you're gone?" "Without kith or kin" in a manner of speaking, you know, huh? You wouldn't want to stand in his light now, would you? It's for Tommy to say. You know, it's a strange thing now, your mentioning that three-acre field. I was just considering that field a while back. Manuring the topsoil would put the heart back in it two years. Well, we'll think about it... You'll be along to my place then in the morning, seven o'clock? Right. Ah, thanks. Well good day to you, Bridget Monaghan. Good day to you, Jamesy. Er, you forgot to settle my wages. We'll talk about that after your first week. - Can't we have a candle? - All right. I wouldn't think you'd need a blaze of light to see the road to your mouth. - It's Saturday. - Is it now? What about my wages? Here... There you are. I want my full wage. What'd a scrap of a lad like you be doing with a full wage? - The government thinks I earn it. - Ah, the government! I'll tell you what, though... We'll split the difference, huh? Or your high notions will be having me in the poorhouse. No they won't! I'm giving notice! A man can't do a full day's work on the food you have. What's wrong with it? Well, there's nothing wrong with sausages once in a while, but we shouldn't have them morning, noon and night, every day of the week. - Why don't you kill a pig? - What, for ourselves? That sow is past her prime, and she's uneconomical. She's a fine, healthy pig. Well, I'll think about it. - Remind me on Monday. - I'll do that. Oh, there's some skimmed milk there you might take home. We don't take charity. It's that sister of yours gives you them ideas. I think the same as Mary does. The sergeant says it's an open-and-shut case. It's high time for that wonderful cousin of yours to show some return for all the fine Christmas boxes you've given him. The justice knows him well and won't give any trouble. Ha, he'd better not! Come, William, "Let justice be done though the heavens fall". It'll be a mercy for the children themselves to be taken from that mother and sent to industrial schools. It's no proper home for the poor little innocents. Isn't that so, Jamesy Casey? I'm not so sure about that at all, at all. - I'm just filling in time. - What brought you to Doon? I wanted Phil Donahue to give me a hand killing the pig, but he's to court with the rest of them. You, killing a pig? I am that. She's past her prime. She's... uneconomical. Gentlemen, this is no time to be discussing bacon. Let us be on our way. Sergeant Dempsey versus Bridget Monaghan, sir. Clear the court. Clear the court! - "In need of care and protection"? - Yes, sir. Oh no, no, no. You can't go in. No, no, no, no. Nobody's allowed. No, nobody's allowed in there. Come on. Get along, Maggie Murphy, you know you can't stay for the children's court. If I help some into the world, Billy Dempsey, there's one I wouldn't mind helping out. - Here, come on, come on... - Will you take your hands off me? Who do you think you're shoving? Let me go, Billy Dempsey! The cheek of you, anyway! - Six children and no father? - No, sir. - Is the widow in court? - No, Your Worship. Where is she, then? She isn't, Your Worship. What do you mean, man? She isn't what? She isn't a widow, Your Worship. - Never mind that. Is she in court? - Yes, Your Worship, yes. Bridget Monaghan. These the children in the case, Sergeant? Yes, Your Worship. Five of them, that is. The eldest boy has left school and is working for his fath... for a farmer - and couldn't get away. - They look well-nourished. They look well-nourished, Your Worship, but their income is very small, only what the woman earns with her dressmaking. But I'm the only dressmaker in Doon, Your Worship, so there's plenty to do, we... - We've never wanted for anything. - I see. And Tommy's earning now too, sir. Yes, that's my eldest boy, and he's a good boy. He'll be bringing home his wages now. We can only go on the evidence before us, Sergeant. - Are you children well-fed? - Oh yes, Your Worship. No! Now, now, you mustn't intimidate a witness. Come along up here. Come on. Come along, speak up. I get one spoon of jam. That's fed, but not well-fed. The court agrees. Have you any evidence, Sergeant, that the home is not kept clean and neat? Well, er... No. They certainly look clean. I'm not always as clean as this. She will keep on washing me. Even Poppy gets her face dirty sometimes. I do not! Of course you do. Why would you ever have to wash if you didn't? Are you happy and contented in your home, children? Oh yes, Your Worship, very, very happy. - No! - No? We could be a lot happier if you could stop Mary washing us and fussing if clothes get torn. - Clothes can't help getting torn. - Of course they can't. And stop her sending us too early to bed. - This is serious. - Don't send Mary to prison, though. She only does all those things because she thinks they're good for us. Just stop her. - Anything else you want? - Yes, a horse for me. Oh, I'm afraid I can't manage a horse. But there'll be no more washing today. Now that's an order of the court. But the point in this case, Your Worship, it's not so much the children's bodily well-being, it's their moral welfare. Anything known against the character of the mother? Within recent years? Well, we feel the atmosphere of their home is not morally sound. That's why we're applying for the children to be sent away. Oh, Your Excellency! Just a moment. Can you offer any evidence to the effect that their home is not morally sound? But how could I get that kind of evidence, Your Worship? Well? You're not going to send us away, Your Excellency. If you do, Mammy's heart'll break. We may be poor, but our home is a nest of love. That's what you couldn't prove. Eh, Sergeant? I see no point in continuing. Case dismissed. My cousin did his best, but the justice wouldn't listen. He was cracking jokes with the children the whole time. Cracking jokes, were you? Well, you can laugh this one off. Until that woman and her children are moved out of the district, William Bates, all is over between us. - What do you mean, Martha? - I mean what I say. How do I know it'd stop at twins? How do I know it wouldn't be triplets? Or four, or five? Me with rows of babies, and the papers writing about me, and pictures! Ah, now Martha, you can't do this to me! Martha! - All right, Mick? - All right. - Usual, please. - Right you are now. I always say, "What's good for the nursing mother is good for the nurse". You're holding your own on it, anyway. There's no sociability in this place tonight. Would you ever guess by the look of him now, Doctor, that William Bates is the grand, manly man he's proved himself to be? What's really wrong with this country is too many Maggie Murphys, male and female. Doctor, would you come over and see if you can get a bit of sense out of William Bates for us? - What's wrong now, William? - It's the wife, Doctor. She's a fine woman, but she says the Monaghans must go. Wasn't that all thrashed out in court this morning? Case dismissed. Serves you right for persecuting the poor woman. Actually, this matter hardly concerns me very deeply. I have no matrimonial entanglements. No what? - No wife, William. - You have a daughter. Now, now, now! Order, order. If none of you have a decent, Christian idea of your duty to the Monaghans, you should keep quiet about them. That's just what I said to myself. But there's one decent way of getting Bridget Monaghan and her family out of the district. What's that Jamesy? Speak up, man, speak up now. Entice her. Lure her. Ah, you're drunk, Jamesy Casey, I'm going home. Now quiet, Jim, quiet. Let's here what Jamesy has to say. Well, it seems to me the only thing to do is to get a nice, neat, little farm for her, at least a hundred miles away, and stock it. Sure, that'd cost 1,000 pounds, at least. And the stock another 500. - I'm a poor man. - That'd cost a fortune... Now, now, now. Quiet, the lot of you. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Whose fault is it that there's so many Monaghans in the district? Hers, surely. Was it Bridget Monaghan's fault that Mary's father went and got himself killed before he'd time to marry her? No, no, not quite, but that was only the beginning. And then what did the poor woman try to do? Provide a father's care and protection for her child. - And what did she get? - Tommy. And seeking a father for Mary and Tommy, what did she get? - Poppy. - Thank you. And then what happened? The twins. And let's not forget Toughy. I'm not forgetting Toughy. Maybe Jamesy's on the right track. I'll tell you what I'll do. If you find half between you, I'll find the other half. That's generous, Jim, very generous. What about you, Jamesy? Ah, well I'm a poor man, Doctor, but I could scrape up 50 pounds. 50 pounds? It's an insult! But you must all of you admit that having the Monaghans around never worried me any. Sure, it's only out of consideration for the three of you that I'm joining in at all. Is 50 the most you can manage, Jamesy? It's more than the most, Doctor. You see, it's like this: I have Tommy working for me, and he's a likely lad, the best I ever had. So I stand to lose manpower as well as money by the transaction. I'll give 500 pounds. My wife's a fine woman, but if she ever hears I've spent all this... It is a far, far better thing you do, William, than you have ever done. Very nice, Matthew. And what about yourself? - I shall contribute my might. - Might? Oh yeah. Are you or are you not going to pay your share? I'll pay. But 200 pounds is a cruel price. All right then, that's settled. Now, who'll take on the job of looking for a likely farm? Well, as I found the lease money, I will. And for nothing, just my bare expenses. Come on, drink up, boys. The next round's on me. I've never known you so generous before, Jamesy. I've never had an expense allowance before. Moira always has her calves in the middle of the night. So I'll be wanting you to sleep at the farm for a little bit, starting tomorrow. I'm going away myself on business. I could be giving the house some whitewash while you're away. It needs it. Ah, it can go on needing it, we've enough else to do. The walls are bad, but the roof's worse. And how do you propose to improve that? Paint it. Red, I think. Red would look nice with white. I'm not living in a doll's house for you or anybody else. Well maybe red might be a little bright, but black wouldn't be bad. You wouldn't mind black, would you? No. No, it would be cheaper. We could use tar. We could use brown for the door and windows. That'd look nice, but still a bit bare. I could make a flowerbed all along the front. I'll plant flowers. And how much is that going to cost me? Nothing. We've plenty to spare at home. Ah, Mary won't take nothing for nothing from me. I'm not taking charity from her either. Flowers is different. Flowers and skimmed milk, 'tis all the same thing. Pity. Well I... I could pay for them flowers with eggs. You could do that, couldn't you? Mind you, it'd take a hell of a lot of flowers to pay for a dozen good eggs. Now be quiet, children. And pay attention. A film company is coming to Ireland to make a picture called-- Isle of Dreams, Miss Kelly, featuring Maybella Merton, the child star. "This picture is designed to put the Emerald Isle on the screen in all the green glory of her natural splendour". How do you know all this? It was in all the fan papers weeks ago. Oh, was it? Well, anyway, they're coming to Doon. - Doon, Miss? - Miss! Quiet, children! They're arriving today. Later on, children may be required for some scenes. And I've said that it can be arranged, if it doesn't interfere with school. Can I, Miss? You'll have to get your parents' consent, of course. You can ask that when you're home to dinner. What about you, Poppy. I don't want to go with "children". You would expect to be offered the leading part, I suppose? Very well, Poppy. Now, children, let's get on with the lessons. - Well, Poppy? - I want to see my daddy. Well you can't, he's busy. What do you want? Can't a daughter just want to see her daddy? You are not just any daughter. What do you want from him? Well, as a matter of fact, I'd like that box of chocolates in the window, the ten-shilling one. Well, that's quite simple: give me the ten shillings and I'll get it for you. But I haven't got ten shillings. I wouldn't ask it for myself, but it's a present. If you haven't got ten shillings, you can't have the big box. You'd better take a smaller one. No, it must be that one. I don't suppose I could owe you a bit on it? No. Take my very last penny. When you give a present, you shouldn't count the cost. Look, Sir Humphrey Watkins warned me that a wetting is fatal to Maybella. All right. All right, all right, I'll see the director. You stay here quietly till I come back. Yes, Mummy. - Hello. - What are you doing here? I came to look on. - You can't stay, not here. - You're here. I'm Maybella Merton, don't you know me? Not the Maybella Merton? - May I sit beside you for a while? - Certainly. Thank you. - Would you like a chocolate? - Choose soft ones. That's one, I think. I'll leave it there and then you can take one when you want. It's wonderful to meet you, Miss Merton. I suppose anything unusual is exciting in a place like this. Oh no, not just anything. But meeting you is, meeting a famous film star. I'll give you a signed photograph of myself, if you like. That'd be wonderful. Would there be a place for another girl like you in this film? Of course not. I'm the only child star in it. Is that the film script? Would you mind if I had a look at it? Do. - Shall I hear your lines? - No. I know them. I've only got to read them once. - Practice, you know. - Please let me hear you say them. Oh, all right. Page 12, scene 18, give me my cue. Little Bridie runs up to the priest and slips her hand into his. Priest: "It's all the troubles of the whole world you seem to be carrying on your little shoulders, my darling". "Och, Your Reverence, that's how I'm sad..." Why do you call the priest "Your Reverence"? That's Irish. What's after "it's how I'm sad, to think..." "that maybe one day I'll not be wanting..." "that's how I'm sad, to think that maybe one day I'll not be wanting to run and play, - maybe poor and..." - "Wuite like an old..." Don't interrupt. But it says "quite like" comes first here. I improve my dialogue as I go along. Now how does it go on? Then you dance down to the water's edge... That's enough, I know all the rest. - What are you doing here? - Looking in. You wait there. - What's your name? - Toughy. - And your other name? - Toughy Monaghan. Everyone knows me. I've no doubt. What brings you here? I came to have a look at the house. Who told you to come, your mother? Nobody tells me to do things, I just do them. Have you ever been here before? Yes, over there. Me and the man saved the dog from a bull. What man? He said he lived in this house. Then he suddenly got angry with me and told me to go away. Well, he was quite right. You keep away from this house. All right, I'll go. I don't want to stay here. Mostly people like me. Are you hurt? No. Well, why didn't you open the gate? You're a very stupid little boy. I never open gates. Well, you... You'd better come in and wash your hands and knees. No, I like dirt. Blood too. Well, you can't walk home like that. I can. Go away. I can't walk home with you watching me. You know, when men get themselves hurt, they get themselves cleaned up straight off. Even if they're only a little hurt, not half as bad as you. Because it's sensible. You mean like not annoying bulls. Yes, like that. I've got some honeycomb. Just as the bees made it. Come on, then. I'm not crying. Of course not. I don't suppose you ever cry. Not since I was young. I might've cried then. Young children usually do. But it's instead of talking, so it doesn't count. This, er... may sting a bit. I'm not crying. I expected that stinging stuff in the bottle. Not that I minded the stinging, but I expect it's like onions. Yes, I expect it is like onions. Oh Peter, you really ought to be able to manage this yourself by now. I do, until it gets temperamental. Peter, you must come down to earth. Why don't you try to do some work? I am working. I've been painting roofs in Edinburgh for the past year, and in Paris roofs for six months before that. You must be very tired of roofs. No, I wanted to go on painting them for ever. So I knew I had to break away. That's why I came to the quiet backwaters of dreamy Doon. - To look for inspiration. - Didn't people like? - Didn't they buy? - Oh, they liked them. Of course they didn't buy them. Maybe they will in 100 years' time. Oh dear, that won't be much use to you. No, but maybe posterity will say, "That's a Peter Howard". I suppose there'll be some satisfaction in that. Are you sure they will? Heavens, girl! Sometimes I'm sure. You've a very practical mind, haven't you? I suppose so. You can't help it, it's because you're a family. It's a very nice family, but it's fatal to have attachments. But no one is without some attachments. I am. I'm lucky, of course, to start off in an orphanage. And I intend to stay lucky. No ties, no worries. Always free to go where I want, when I want. I'll never marry. I don't think I will either. You may some time, you know? I think most women need a home and children eventually. The girl who knows that love and marriage are very different things - can live her own life fully first. - Peter, I didn't mean... You know, the world's afraid of love. It tries to make it small and safe and tame. A woman wants a house and a husband to pay the bills. And she calls that love. A man wants a comfortable home and a wife to run it. And he calls that love. They let themselves be cheated by ridiculous conventions. And you and I belong to the people who won't be cheated. Did you bring me back those grey socks? Yes. I wish you wouldn't try to sew the holes yourself, I only have to pick the stitches out again. You should be asleep long ago, Poppy. But I must finish my sewing, Mammy, I need it for the morning. If you take the candle away, I'll do it by the light of the moon, even if it means I go blind. There's no moon tonight. Then I'll go blind all the quicker. - What's it meant to be? - A dress. - But it's full of holes. - It's meant to be. Oh dear, what terrible stitches. You'll never make a dressmaker. I don't want to be a dressmaker, I'm going to be a film star. We all have our dreams when we're young, Poppy. But you mustn't expect them all to come true. Please let me finish it, Mammy. I've never, never wanted anything so much in all my life before. - Well, I'd finish it for you-- - Mammy, would you really? But I can't make head or tail of what it's meant to be. Haven't you got a picture or a pattern or something? Yes, like that. Are you sure you want a new dress full of holes and ragged at the hem? Yes, just like that. Well now, you go to sleep. And when you waken up in the morning, it'll be all finished beside your bed. - Good night, darling, sleep well. - Good night. Miss Merton! - I've got something to show you. - Have you? There's a pool over there with very peculiar fish. Oh, fish. Yes, but these are green and red and, well, very peculiar fish. Oh, all right. Come on, I'll help you over the slippery bits. In there. I don't see any fish. There, hidden by the seaweed. You lean over and I'll throw a stone in. Help! Mummy, help! - Help! - Maybella! Maybella! I was drowning, Mummy! She tried to drown me! I pulled her out! You pushed me in! I tried to save her falling, but it was too late. The rocks are terribly slippery and she would come. She said something about coloured fish. I'm taking her straight home, we'll get a plane from Dublin. You can't do that. But she's feeling better already, aren't you, Maybella? She must be under Sir Humphrey's care immediately. Don't fuss, woman, you can get a doctor here. She'll be all right tomorrow. We can take the funeral shots today. It'll be at least two weeks before the child is able to work again, - if she escapes pneumonia. - Look here, Mrs Merton! If you're worried about your picture, it couldn't be worse than it is. It certainly would've added nothing to Maybella's reputation. But your contract! Act of God. Now come on, darling. We'll get some hot soup. Now what can we do? Pack up and go home, I suppose. I knew this place was unlucky. The moment I saw it, I felt it: the aura. I could try the agencies for another child. Well anything would be better than that brat. Are we supposed to hang on in this God-forsaken hole while you dredge the agencies? Aren't you December, Alan? "This week, Sagittarius will meet difficulties". All right, pack it in and we'll wire London. - Wrap it up, boys... - You needn't pack it in, Mr Horton. I've stood all I can stand for today. Will you kindly keep the populace away from me? Run away, there's a good girl. - No autographs today. - I can act! I can do everything that Maybella does, only better. No. "Och, Your Reverence, it's how I'm sad, to think that maybe one day, I'll not be wanting to run and play no more, but maybe be old and quiet, like". Go on, go on. "Would you say that the angels are quiet, like? Or would they be small ones like me that might be after wanting to play too?" Come on, Harry. What's the matter with you? "But sure, my darling, and heaven's full of angels of all shapes and sizes". I can't see that she's any worse than the other. - Definite possibilities here. - The other one was a brute. You could make something of her, Alan, you're so wonderful with children. - I like the eyes. - Appealing expression. And the bone structure. - Yes, there's something. - Yes, there's something. - Pretty kid, too. - She's not bad. She doesn't sound as Irish as Maybella, though. Remember how you got that Greek girl talking Scots? I wonder? I wonder? Let's try something. Listen, I want you to imagine that you're the daughter of a poor fisherman and you've just heard that your daddy has been drowned. I know the scene, Mr Horton. I run down to the water's edge and call out, "Daddy, Daddy, come back! For it's the heart inside of me that's after breaking". No, I don't want you to say anything. Just run down to the water's edge and look at the sea as... As if your heart was broken. - I see, no dialogue, Mr Horton. - I know it's difficult, but try it. That was something! Conditions will improve later for Sagittarius. Not for me, though: I'm Virgo. We'll shoot it as a test. Get the camera over there. Right, stand by, cameras. That was good. I'd like you to get made up, and we'll take a picture of you doing it. - Right, make-up. - Thank you, Mr Horton. Now it's just a test. I can't say anything till I've seen you on the screen. - Oh, I understand that. - Run along, then. - Mr Horton? - Yes? There's something I'd like to ask you. Go ahead. Don't you think I ought to have a close-up when I'm being told about my father? Now listen. You leave script, direction, wardrobe, make-up, photography, publicity, sound recording and finance alone. All you have to worry about is doing as you're told. Got it? I was only thinking of the good of the picture. - I thought you were never coming. - I said I'd come. Yes, but you might have changed your mind. I had to make sure the hens were fed here. Well, I'm glad you came. Now that turkey cock frightens me to death. I'll see to him after tea. Oh, I don't really think he means any harm. He'd better not. You'll have to go, Toughy, the back way. - Is it that man coming? - Yes. I don't see why I need to go. I'm not frightened of him. Well, perhaps you're not, but I am. Please hurry, Toughy. All right, but I'll be back tomorrow. Yes, all right. Ellen! Ellen? I've got to go down to the village. How about a cup of tea before I go? - All right, I'll get it now. - Ellen? Maybe it's a bit small to pickle out, but it's the first rose for all that. So, another summer's properly begun for us. It's kind of you to remember the same as ever, Jim. Let the summers come and go from now on. There's no use in pretending any longer. I'll get the tea. What's wrong with you at all lately? I told you. It's a great pity you ever went near Dublin. What does it matter if we don't have a family? I married you for yourself. That's all you'll get. I never thought I'd hear a bitter word from your mouth. Weren't we happy the way we were? We didn't know then. What difference need that make? All the difference in the world. Oh, it all seems... It all seems only a mockery now. We were enough for each other before, we're enough for each other still. This farm's been handed down from father to son for generations. It was unlucky the day I came into it. We're half an hour waiting for you. Yes, Jamesy, in a state of considerable tension. You can tell that to the railway company. Did you find a place? Well... Well, Jamesy, you're back from your travels. I am that. Speak up now, Jamesy, we're becoming impatient. I found the very thing in the County Kildare. 36 acres of arable and a nice farm. All at the right price and a good 100 miles from here. Tell me, is there a good school there, now, for the twins? Oh, there's a nice big one with all the contraptions known to modern science. Have you fixed it finally, Jamesy? I didn't sign anything yet, but I told the agent I'd give him a ring in the morning. Well, are we all agreed to buy the place? - Aye. - All right. Well, that's grand. I'll be off home, so. Tell me, could you give me a lift to Bridget Monaghan's? Why, may I ask? Well, someone's got to tell her to pack her traps for the County Kildare. But sure, I brought them up without help from any of you up till now. I know, Bridget, I know. Sure, you never took a penny piece from anybody and we respect you for it. Then what's making the four of you suddenly decide to give me all this? Well, you might call it conscience in a way: we're none of us getting any younger. Jamesy, I wouldn't be exchanging the sight of that hawthorn in bloom for all the broad acres of Ireland. Ah sure, if it wasn't for the children, we wouldn't be asking you. They might be better off away from neighbours with long memories. Bridget, there's a grand, big school next door for the twins. And a fine little farm for Tommy, a kitchen for Mary, and acres and acres of room for Toughy to play around in. And I didn't forget you either, Bridget. Ah sure, 'tis well I remember how we used to talk of the joy of the hawthorn in bloom in the spring. When we were both... Well, when we were a deal younger, huh? Did you, Jamesy? I did. And that's the first thing I looked for was a farm with a grand crop of hawthorns. Up and down the country I was tramping, till I found the very place in Kildare. Well, now... Maybe for the sake of the children... Ah, but I'd be sad to leave this. Now, that's right. That's right, Bridget, now wait. Now look, just you leave everything to me, huh? Well, I'll bid you good afternoon, Bridget Monaghan. Hi, boy! Boy! Hey! Hey, where the devil are you? Hah! That's a nice kind of welcome you have for me, I must say. Ah, finish your little snooze and I'll go and light the fire, get myself a bite to eat after my long journey. I'm sorry, I meant to have the kitchen tidied and a meal ready for you. - But the animals are all right. - What's the matter with you? I'm not feeling very well. - Did you hurt yourself? - No. Just a pain... Here. Where? Huh? Oh, that's a damned bad spot. Here! If I give you a hand, do you think you can get over to the house? Yes, I think so. It's a fine little calf Moira's got. Well, to hell with the calf, come on now! When did it start? Yesterday morning, but it's worse today. I've been able to get around, though. Did nobody come near you? No, why should there be? Because it's supposed to be a Christian country, that's why. You might've been dead and buried and nobody known or cared. Not buried, whoever buried me'd have to know. Now stop arguing with me. They'll be expecting me at home, now you're back. Now you've got to lie quiet till I get Dr Cassidy for you. - I must go home! - You'll do what I tell you. I'm your father. My name's Monaghan! Whatever the hell your name is, I'm still your father. Bridget Monaghan! You'd better get across to my place, Tommy's sick. I'm going to fetch the doctor. He has an appendix. I'm afraid there's grave danger of perforation. We must have him operated on at once. Well who's the best surgeon? Now look, what about that chap at the nursing home that made such a good job of Mrs Fruin when her insides was all twisted up? Ah, yes. But Tommy'll be going to hospital. There are good men there too, you know. I want the nursing home, I want Mrs Fruin's surgeon. It'll cost you a lot of money, Jamesy. Well I can pay for what I want, Doctor. He's a good boy to work. Well, as good as they come these days, which isn't saying much. All right, we'll get him to the nursing home as quickly as possible. Now we need a parent's consent before we operate. Lucky you got Bridget here. I gave my consent, didn't I? Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. Bridget. - We just got him in time. - Thank God. Don't worry, he's going to be all right. It's only a faint. But you're to keep your mouth shut, mind. You're the only one that knows except your mother. The others'll have to know sometime. You can't just pack them off to County Kildare and them not knowing where they are till they get there. Ah sure, we'll tell them the night before they leave. Sure, Poppy'll be spreading it all over the neighbourhood as though she was Columbus taking off for America. Why, you're not looking very pleased with the nice, new farm that we bought you. Pleased enough, but I'm worried about our place. I mean... your place, after I'm gone. Who's the new boy? Oh no, him? I didn't do anything about that yet. We'll have to see he prunes the roses in the autumn. I'd be kind of interested to hear how the three-acre field does in the spring. Ah sure, the three-acre field won't be worrying you on your nice, new farm. It might. I've always been interested in that field. You mustn't go back to nothing but sausages. What, are you afraid I might be stepping back into my old bad habits, huh, with you leaving me? You might. Now well, I sure I can't be wasting time, sitting around talking here. Oh, they said you could have a wireless. Well there's one coming. But it's hired. So be careful now. If you break it, you'll have to pay for it. I won't break it. Well, goodbye now. If I'm passing this way, I'll look in again, huh? How's the calf? Oh, oh, she's all right, she's all right. Oh, don't forget the grit for the chickens and the-- Poppy's done so well in her test, we want to put her under a long-term contract. How would you feel about letting her come to London? We think she's got a great future. No, I can't let her go off alone to a strange country. I wouldn't mind being alone in a strange country. Poppy, love, you don't know what you're saying. We could arrange for a suitable guardian in England. No, I can't let her be brought up by someone we know nothing about. Even if she'd everything that I can't give her, she'd be unhappy there with no one belonging to her. I don't think I'm the lonely type, Mammy. I can't let you go from me, Poppy, with no one to turn to. It wouldn't be right. Well, we're not leaving till tomorrow. Think it over in the meantime. I'm afraid my mind is made up once and for all. It's a great pity. I hope you won't regret it for her later on. Poppy, love, you're too young to understand, but I am doing the best for you. Yes, Mammy. I'll go to the gate and say goodbye to Mr Horton. Goodbye. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. You needn't be sorry yet, Mr Horton. There's one chance left, come on. What made you think you'd like to have me in charge of you? We've never been friends. I know, but there's no one else, and you're a most respectable woman. You'll be old and you'll be dead soon, and if you don't come to London with me, you'll never have nice things. Only dull things always. If it was me I'd come. And I thought you might be like me. Well, I'm not like you. You'd think that if a person had a brother that left people deserted, they'd want to atone to one of those deserted people. But sometimes a person is very cruel. It's sad to have only one aunt and not even be allowed to call her it. I must have her. You see, she has everything. I see I'd be mad to think of tying myself up in any way with this child. But why should it be mad to do something vital, something new? Poppy has said all that, much more effectively. This is Mr Alan Horton, a famous film director. - This is my... my... - My brother. Oh, how do you do, sir? I myself have trodden the boards, er... in my youth. Only in amateur productions, but still I believe not unworthily. He wants to make me a star. I told him about you treading the boards, you know. And he said, "Yes, that must be where I got my... my talent". And when they'll be writing about me in the papers, they'll be writing about you too, of course. Because you're my... my father. We think Poppy may have a wonderful future, Mr Hogan. Only I can't go to London. I must have a guardian and there's no one to take me. Oh Daddy, I know how disappointed you'll be. Child, I shall take you. Poppy is so young, it must be a woman. We asked Aunt... We asked her, but I think she doesn't like to leave you alone, Daddy dear. Joanna... Take this child and forget you have a brother. But I don't feel like uprooting myself for a niece... of sorts. Give me the consolation of knowing that, although the fire within this breast was hidden, I have handed on the torch to my daughter. Possibly it would be wrong for me to allow this torch to splutter out in Doon. Then, Miss Hogan, you... Art is long, Joanna, life is short. Will you take me? Very well. I will. - Oh Aunt... - But I warn you, you may find being in my charge more than you bargained for, my dear Poppy. Yes, Auntie dear. Steady now, keep still. Do you never let people see their portraits until they're finished, Peter? Never. It disturbs me and them. Now you can look. It's not very like me, is it? It is you for me. It's what I feel when I look at you. It's... Well, it's you. You mean it's the inner me? It's how I see you. Mary... Mary, there's something I've been wanting to tell you all day. But I didn't want you to lose your expression. If you'd suddenly looked too happy, I might have wanted to paint you all over again. Yes, Peter. My second-best roofs have won a travelling scholarship to Italy. Is that what...? I mean, what about your best roofs? The judges passed over those. What can you expect of academicians any...? Mary... A year in Florence! Isn't it wonderful? I'm leaving Doon tomorrow. Tomorrow... It... It's wonderful. I'm so glad for you, Peter. I knew you'd be as glad as I am myself. But I... I didn't mean to leave so soon, though. I thought all the summer was before us. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. Our days together seem to have gone so quickly. This cursed job, it takes hold of your body and soul. So this is goodbye? Don't let's say it before we must. Come and say goodbye to me tonight. Of course, Peter. Come down to the bay. There'll be a moon tonight. It'll all be as pretty as a picture postcard. You'll hate that. I'll only be looking at you. I wonder if any face in paint or stone in Florence will mean as much to me as yours. You'll find other faces, Peter. I'll be waiting tonight. I'll come. All alone in the dark? Ah, I'm dreaming away to myself. I've been watching the moonlight and the firelight flowing together like two tides. It's seldom you have time for dreaming, Mother. Maybe it's just as well. I like to see you doing nothing for a change. You're a good daughter to me, Mary. Why wouldn't I be? Well... Sometimes I think a daughter might... - Might feel annoyed with me. - Oh, don't say that, Mother! It was never true, not ever. I'm going out for a while to say goodbye to Peter. He's leaving tomorrow. You look lovely in that dress. Your eyes are like two shining stars. I'm afraid you're going to miss him when he's gone. You've grown very fond of him. Yes. Mary... Yes, Mother? Nothing. Will you... Will you be quiet. I thought you were never coming, Doctor. I'm out of my mind with these lads. What's the trouble? Jamesy's losing his senses. - What are his symptoms? - He wants... He wants a pedigree bull for Bridget Monaghan's farm. And the company's water laid on for a bathroom. Not to mention electric light and power. Have you the money to pay for all this, Jamesy? Not yet, Doctor. I was hoping you'd persuade these flint-hearted men to do the right thing by Bridget Monaghan and her herd of poor, innocent children. Now there's no need for a pedigree bull on a small farm. Well, I'll meet them halfway there. 'Tis the water and electricity that's important. Sure enough, it wouldn't be right to leave them dirty and in the dark. Come on, men: give the woman her bath between you. - But not electricity. - That too, in the name of progress. Fine, then. Sign here. Well, I... I imagine a gentlemen's agreement would have been sufficient. - Oh, I don't think much of them. - Thank you. Well now, here's the deeds to the farm. So everything's above board, I think. Well, that's that, gentlemen. Congratulations to you all. Now friends, I ask you to drink a hearty vote of thanks to Jamesy Casey for his wholehearted devotion to our common weal. Here, here! - I'll second that. - Sláinte, Jamesy. May your shadow never grow less. Well now, all that remains to be done is to hand over the deeds to Bridget. - Oh, I'll do that. - Better make it today. She'll be leaving in the morning. We don't want the neighbours to know she's gone until after they've left. Right. Well, I'd better be off and meet my client. Good day to you, Doctor. - Good day. - All the best. Good luck, now. Sergeant, I want a quiet word in the doctor's ear. Right, I'll be near if you need me. You did take the hypocritical oath, didn't you? "Hippocratic", Jamesy. That's what I said, Doctor, now look... Here's a lovely brown one. Oh! You can have that for your tea. You wait here and slip off when we go into the house. No, I'm not afraid of him! Hey! - Hey, what are you doing here? - Oh, I didn't recognise you. Maybe you'd recognise my bull. I wouldn't recognise any of you, I've forgotten you. Now you keep... Ellen! Ellen! I was hoping to spare you the hurt of ever seeing him. Nothing hurts me any more. Talking to you is like talking to a statue. Can't you be human for once? I warned him to keep away from here. But you'll never have to see him again. The Monaghans are leaving tomorrow for County Kildare. Kildare? Myself and... three others that are like me bought a farm to settle them, 100 miles from here. We want to live without the past tripping us up everywhere we move. So... You've been planning this all along. Yeah. Toughy's going away for ever? Yeah. You're sending Toughy away. You want to pretend he doesn't exist. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about your son. You'd be more careful with one of your yearlings, wouldn't you, than your own child? Now look! Whatever I've done, I've done for you. Huh, for me! But don't you see? I thought it was the one last hope for you and me. All right, I'll tell you... Toughy comes here often. Well, he has a perfect right to come here, hasn't he? He helps me, comes in and out by that window. He isn't afraid of anyone, not even you. Now he won't be coming any more. Oh love, I... How could I know that? You and I, we're so full of our own stupid pride, we haven't bothered about Toughy at all. There he is, stalking round, thinking how great he is. Never guessing that everyone's ashamed of him. Imagine anyone being ashamed of Toughy. Well, I'm not ashamed of him. He's my son. Jim... I want Toughy. Go and get him. You mean to live here? Yes. Always? You... You do want him, don't you? - I want you. - But him? I want you. You first. And him too. Yes, but... but... I... I must tell Mary and Tommy. The boy won't mind, but I'm not so sure about Mary. Well, I'll say goodbye to you, Bridget Monaghan, for I'll be busy on my farm in the morning when you're leaving. Bridget Monaghan, I must speak to you. Why yes, Ellen dear, come on in. I just handed over the deeds, like the doctor ordered. You took plenty of time about it, didn't you? Ah, there's a lot to explain to a poor, simple woman, you know. - And what are you doing here? - We want to adopt Toughy. But sure you just paid nearly 1,000 pounds to get rid of him! No, I can't give Toughy to you. Oh, Jim... Please help me to make her understand. I want him, Bridget. I know that I've got less right than anybody else in the world to ask him of you. It's Ellen who's asking you. I... I won't give away my son. You're not a hard woman. You have so much. I have nothing. Oh Bridget, don't you see? We've no life at all unless we have Toughy. All that's mine will be his. Even if he refuses, I promise that. It's his right. Bridget cares nothing for your 300 acres, Jim. She wants more than that for Toughy. If you could be sure that... that we'd try to give him everything that you give him. Would you change your mind? We love Toughy. I love Toughy. Listen, Bridget... If I knew that by never seeing Toughy again... I could have a child of my own... Do you hear me? Yes. I swear to you, I'd choose Toughy. Do you believe me? You've said a strange thing, Ellen Power, but... I believe you. What are you doing in my house? Don't be afraid, I'll mind you. Oh, he's not angry any more. It was a mistake. Er yes, there was a boy hanging around the place who was chasing the chickens. I thought you were him. A boy like me doesn't chase small things like chickens. No. No, of course not. It... It was a very stupid mistake. - That's all right, how's the bull? - Well, he's fine. I could do with a bit of help with him, though. Me and her are busy with the hens and that, but I expect I could give you a hand with them sometimes. Toughy. Toughy, would you like to go and stay with Mr and Mrs Power on their farm? That'd be nice for them, I'm very useful. She doesn't never want to let me go when I'm with her. Now we could do all the things we haven't had time to do. Can I ride the horses in from the fields? Every day. It's an awful big farm, they'll need me for a very long time. They can have you just as long as you want to stay. Now, will you go and get me some water and we'll all have a pot of tea together? I'll fix that bull. All right, take it easy till I've finished my business! - Well, can't you read? - It's plain enough. It'll be strange to be without you, Mary. It's better for you, Mother. - I wouldn't fit in there. - Maybe not. But I don't like to think of you coming home alone to this empty house. I won't have time to be lonely. I'll be too busy trying to be as good a dressmaker as you were. Here's the car! Where would the Monaghans be off to, all dressed up like for a funeral in Tim Hurley's hired car? And it's piled to the sky with luggage! A happier place the world would be, were all of us to attend only to our own affairs. And whose affairs will Jamesy Casey be attending to? Woman? What's he got to do with the Monaghans? Who are you calling "woman"? Isn't he in the front seat of the car with a flower as big as a saucer in his coat! Peddle off like the wind and rouse up Dr Cassidy. But what about my paper round? In times of crisis, first things first. Hurry, boy. Hurry. Ah, that's neat, now that's artistic. You're in great good humour all together this morning, aren't you? Am I, my dear? - Hello, Maggie, fine day. - And fine goings on in it too. There's the Monaghans all gone flaunting off in a car. - No! - And Jamesy Casey as large as life in the middle of them. Well, there's no decency left in men. There never was much. And Matthew Hogan's carrying on like a lunatic at the news, sending left, right and centre for the doctor. And looking as if he'll be needing the priest itself before long. What's Jamesy Casey up to? I don't know, but whatever it is, the doctor's in it. Jamesy was whispering away in his ear the other day. But where's the doctor? I've already summoned him here, doubtless he's in transit at the moment... The doctor isn't at home. - Well, where is he? - He's gone to Wexford. Himself and Jamesy were so deep in their business that day, they never thought of asking me if I'd a mouth on me. Our only hope is to follow the doctor. I'm with you, William. Every foot of the way. - There's Tim Hurley's car! - And the doctor's. Whoa! Whoa! Well, boys. How do you feel about giving Jamesy Casey such a grand wedding gift? - A 1,000-pounds' farm. - 500 pounds to stock it with. And don't forget, we laid on water and electricity into the bargain. Ah well, even if you're lighter in your pockets, you're lighter in your consciences too. Come on, boys. We'll drink a health this day to all the little Monaghans, God bless them. I won't be forgetting your birthday next week, love. He promised to let me drive the tractor that day! - I'll miss you, darling. - Don't, Mother. Just be happy. I'll see to that. And don't forget there's a place for you if you want to stay. Good luck! Good luck! Mary! When I was gone from you I wanted to paint you again! I came straight back from Dublin. Your house was shut and I couldn't find you. Oh, and thank heaven for Maggie Murphy. Mary, I want to go on painting you always. But I don't even like your painting. You like me. Oh Peter, you know I love you, but I... Come on, let's see the priest.
