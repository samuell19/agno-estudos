June, 1941. The German eagle has closed its claws on the France of Ambroise Paré. France that lived in the sunny memory of Austerlitz, It comes into contact with Waterloo. The French, generally so jovial, is mortified and suffers. Of course, some get used to it well. But others have happily kept their pride. My dear friend, at least you don't hide your sympathies. The former janitor was less sincere. Are you the one who supplies the paint, Mr. Ramirez? From de Gaulle. Excuse me, when one is nervous this reassures. Shut up, Miss Bourdelle! And get out, virtuous ones! And long live Petain! I am with the great Germany! Europe, the great Europe! Heil Hitler! You bitches! A kind of great bourgeois! And who are you with? Distrust! We'll see. Jean, don't insist. No, André will not conduct an orchestra as long as there is only one German on French soil. It is clear, right? Yes, Jean, you are a good businessman. That's not the question. It is a question of patriotism. Is it tough or what? No. Listen, already in the year 34, in Milan, we refused to play before the fascists And if Count Ciano hadn't crawled to our feet at that reception ... Don't beat us up with your memories. Tell him no and that's it. We will play within 6 months. No, money is not everything. We will fix it. We will rent the rooms! This is huge. And if we sell the Rolls, we have Papy's Talbot. Goodbye! - Have you taken it the wrong way? - Put yourself in his place! You lose your commission! It is not to make concessions. Indeed, concessions. André Bourdelle no longer does them. For a year now, behind the back of his family, he has led a resistance network. In hiding, he's only Captain Remon. What's up, André? Let's go, let's respect the schedule. It's blocked, right! Today we are not lucky. Gives back, we will see in the presbytery. Oh, very good, my general! And says it's the first time who takes a racket ... But he does some dunks like nobody else! Yes, his style resembles Borotra's. Do you know Borotra? - The alpinist? - Well ... a great athlete. - Good morning sir. - Good Morning. Shit! - It's good wine. - Thank you. Help! - Father! - I'll be right back! Quita, pooch! It's playful, huh? The weapons are there, they have been dropped tonight. It's not too soon, we can finally work. Magnificent! Tell me, Remon, are you still looking for a tenant? There is a boy here next door, protected from Mrs. Norvil looking for accommodation in Paris. He doesn't look wise, but he does Latin license and has found a vigilante position at Jeanson de Sailly. Stay here, father, I'm on a mission. Quick, guys! Sorry to insist Remon, but Mrs. Norvil does us a lot of favors for landings, ... I'm afraid if I say no ... - Well, I'll go see him, but I shouldn't. It will be fixed. - Good Morning. I appreciate it infinite. It is a great honor to stay with great artists like you. - It is wonderful. "They are 350 francs a month, and a two-month deposit." Ah, don't tell me ... A few words of introduction for my wife. - Thank you. - I leave you alone. Sacred work that de Gaulle does. I admire the Resistance, I have tried to participate myself ... but it is very closed. It is normal because it is secret, and I understand that it is not spoken ... of it to anyone. - If that is. And don't express your opinions to everyone. It's very dangerous. - He'll be in Paris tomorrow. - Can't you take me? Not going to the station? No thanks! Here, it's the new grenades. It's the latest in America! Watch out captain, he's very sensitive. You are right, you are. Grab it, grab it! It seems! It seems! Doesn't it explode? André Bourdelle was gone. Two years later, his house still kept his memory when she was brutally assaulted by the Germans. Stop! Documents, please. - Michel Taupin, I live here. - Ja. Is there someone? Darling, it's me! Get up quickly. I'm in his room. The Germans settle here. They send us a general. The letter is on the bedside table . - Well, they just requisition a room. - Yes, and we have chosen yours. You have to know how to bite the bullet. It is war. But why my room in particular? Darling, I ... In two years I have changed rooms three times . To greater knowledge, greatest darling. Also, getting smaller. I can't accept sleeping anywhere. Michel, this room is not just any place. And look at this. So you don't get up at night. Thanks, but I find it too precarious. No way! The servants have lived here until last year and they were delighted. It's painful enough to receive those dirty Germans at home, ... don't load the inks, Michel. - Michel, it's painful. What if we shared his room? We are engaged. - But Michel, are you delirious? - It's not worth getting tired, a general will not stay in a room without a bathroom. The winners are the Germans, I remind you. What you have to do is remove Michel's clothes. Yes darling. There is no other place. No one will sleep in your father's room! - And don't wink your eyes! - It's very vulgar! If you want to accommodate the Germans, all you have to do is offer them your room. - Michel will give you his place in the attic. - With pleasure. And I remind you that my rent has gone up to 1200 francs a month, ... that's too much for a hovel! - You cretin! And he throws his francs in our faces! Do you think that with that he can live the family for a whole month? Live by the sweat of your hands. You know, I pass your advice here. Guys, we are not going to argue over such a small thing. Calm. It is clear that we have no place, I do not dispute it. I am going to go see the Germans and explain that we cannot receive to that general because this is small, and that's it. Good for the statue, bravo! What happiness! It is a dialect that breaks! It's Beethoven! - You are an ax! - Papy, let me explain it nicely. - Yes, Papy! - Be polite, or we will have problems! Colonel, have you read the requisition order correctly ? Let's take care of the old man! What did you say? Come up, mom. I will kindly explain it to you. You will find out about these slogans! Light, Papy! You can't be ordering with a candle! If we turn on all the lamps at the same time it is normal for this to pop. Silence! It's a cut. This does not come from here. With my little "bricolage" I hope to illuminate the whole neighborhood, shut your mouth, you band of useless people. If you hadn't insulted them, we wouldn't be in this situation. - Save your outbursts. - Okay... Michel don't smoke, please. If we want the air to be breathable, we have to do our part. He's right, Mamina. Living together requires discipline. - Where are the owners? - We have preferred to install them in another area of ​​the house, without discomfort. With this humidity the sheets are moldy. You dirty Germans! Mom, they broke the gramophone. That is not what you expected. I know, inattentions have been committed and we will find the culprits. I will communicate it to the 1st officer to appear. And that sergeant is going to find out. Surely there will be compensation provided. But mom, it's not about moving, it 's the Reich army! They are invaders! Attila never returned a penny. - And they have all the rights! - Shut up, we are ashamed! You speak like German radio. But German radio says true things. And he puts on good records. You disgust me! Son of resistant and talk like that! If he was here, you'd find out! - What is Papy doing? - Saw the device in two. Half for men, the other half for women. It must be programmed. But hey, you're not going to saw all the furniture in two! Warning, I don't sleep in the middle of a bed! Silence, collaborator! I have said the men there, and the women there, ... and you here. - All this oozes. Do you think we are going to spend a long time in this cave? Michel, at this moment nothing is certain. Well, I disagree. We will not accept the impositions of the Germans without question. Never at the Bourdelle's! What is that? I'm afraid it's the Marseillaise. It is shameful! I do not agree. I don't want to pay the duck for you. We are going to end our days in a German mission guarded by French. Papy! I fear nothing! The Germans bring me cool. Now it is OK! I get the impression that they are coming. Silence please! Herr General Spontz! Excellent, Mrs. Bourdelle. However, I prefer them with another repertoire. I have been extremely lucky to hear from you in Bayreuth in '34. Your interpretation of Carmen touched me. What a success that night. Of course it's war, and I respect your patriotism, ma'am. - Goethe. - Well, young man, congratulations. What culture. Thanks, general. His house is superb. I hope I don't disturb you too much. No whatsoever, we're in the cave. I can see that. It is inadmissible. We can share. We prefer to stay here. We already knew the humidity in the Great War. One gets used. Very well. Whatever. In the bathroom there are clothes that ... It bothers? It's mine. I'll go get it when it's dry. - It's dry, Mr. Bourdelle. - Then leave her on the landing, ... I'll go find her right away. - They are in their house. My respects dear lady. Don't worry, I'll be discreet as a hyena. Thanks for your help, Hubert. Now you just have to join the German army. - What happens? - Goethe! Traitor! Single! What do those want? They are complaining about the cave ... They say they are expelled I don't know if we were right to come. We have waited two hours. - They don't want to receive us. - We are in our right, the circular requires a room, not the whole house. They have to receive us. Lieutenant, could you tell the person who is to receive us that we are waiting? - What did you say? -I don't know if they will cooperate as you thought, Mamina. But it is no reason to quit. - What does he want? - Por favor! The bayonet. Don't be an idiot, Michel. It's dangerous, they're going to arrest us. - There are sentries everywhere. - They're from behind, don't be a coward. - Darling, it's not really about that. - Stop calling me "dear", it is too premature. And I'm not marrying a coward. - Bernadette, don't mix things up. - Leave it Mamina, I'll do it. Mr. Mira is going to greet you. Hurry up. Good luck! It is written here: a room. I have made a list of damaged objects , and even stolen. You have done very well. You would be surprised to see how sensitive the Wehrmacht is ... to the claims that come from here. - Even better. They have put a telephone switchboard in the music room And we can't rehearse And for musicians not to rehearse ... it's dramatic. - Listen, I'm first of all French, and I see things as a French. They speak ill of the Germans, but they make efforts, and they are not forced. Here for example, we are fed, warm, perhaps too hot. I've caught a cold. It seems that they are offering us a good opportunity, reflect. And meanwhile, France is rising little by little. And also, as I always say, those who do not share my opinion, that they would have won the war. Well, no kidding ... that's the truth. - What rank does that officer have? - General. Aha ... he's my first general, I'm not hiding it from him. Anyway, you need to rehearse, that's true. It is normal, of course. Tell me... Isn't there by chance a Jew in your family? - How? - Jew ... Don't kill me, I'm just an official! Your coat, quick! Go fast. - What happened? - I saved the situation, I have gone to retrieve the papers, on them is your name and address. - Did three come in? -Yes. - Three have to come out. - Sure, it's normal. You stay behind. Give us two minutes. - And why me? - You're not going to sacrifice Michel? We cannot leave him. If they discover the dead man, they will hang him! All he will do is let us go first. You will pass the control later, at the least inconvenience I cover you. Leave for at least a minute. Good luck. - Documents. - We came from coming to Mr. Mira. I accompany those ladies. Wait for me on the street. - Wass? Has English gotten away? - Eh? Shit! Escape, we are lost! Here we go. It's very calm. - What are you doing? - he trembles from head to toe, ... he has 40d fever! - He's going to faint! Look for salts, Melissa water! - And where do I get it? - In a pharmacy, asshole! - What is Melisa's water for? - It works for everything. In Buenos Aires, in the middle of the opera, the baritone Zofroua Poulain cut his finger. Okay, Mamina, but it's risky. It would be better to hide ... and quietly wait for the night. - Don't be afraid, Michel! I'm not going to go around the shops screaming that I have an Englishman in my arms. - Either follow my plan or I go! - You want a couple of slaps? Of course! - Hey, worm! Do you think you are just going to leave ? -How? Look what you've done with the car. If it wasn't fixed, I barely touched the showcase ... Do you take me for an idiot? You have thrown it away. Listen, the car has nothing, it is intact. Let's have the party in peace. You scoundrel! He did it on purpose! Ms. Piccard! This is at least 200 francs of expenses! Ms. Gomez! No way, it's too much. I'm the one who should complain your sign may have hurt me. Do you realize you could have killed me? Come on, shut up, bug! Alt, sir! - Do we have problems with education? - Beat him up Ralph, don't argue. - You broke Mrs. Gomez's stroller, huh? - It's at least 200 francs. Wow, he's not so cocky now. The fumes have been lowered. What is this to insult honest people? That's very easy, right? - Now it will teach. - It's ridiculous... What a gang of scoundrels. They arrest me being the one who should complain. It's really not my day. - Why are you here? - I killed three Germans. Oh yeah? It's a shit, yes. People are not left like that. It would be the nerves. It happens to anyone, or you haven't found a pharmacy. You're kidding ... he's threatened to leave us and he's done it, he's a coward. - And to think that I was going to marry him. - Yes, disappointing. - Light, please. - How? - Ah, excuse me. - Thank you. - You are not very emotional. - When I start a book I have to know how it ends. Do you think we'll go by train? I would be surprised. Look at the signs on the wall. Shit... There are only two. I'ma pretend to stumble, like the queen mother ... before the tomb of Abdullah when he wants to draw the king's attention. -Yes. Come on, Hans. The old woman has screwed up her knee. I screwed up my kneecap! - Do you have the keys? - Mom has gone looking for them. Is it better? - Is it better, sir? - Yes, I'm fine now, thanks. Get in! But it is very small, I will never be able to get inside. You're starting to get heavy! It is not us who have gone to look for him! You are the one who got us into this mess! And it's going to get in the trunk! From there it does not happen! Ah, that's it, Gustav! You had good trip? - Have you had a good trip? - Ha woll, Herr General! We are going to unpack. We have many things to tell each other. It's bleeding. I'm going to get some cotton. Miss Bourdelle, may I introduce you to a friend? I do not have much time. He is the most gifted character of his generation. We can enter? Nerd! I will not let a woman drive my car! The last time I broke the door. Papy, it was 4 years ago. - Papy, she's vanished. - What a bundle, let's put it in the basket. This is the assistant chief, Gustav. Found it in Russia, thin as a noodle. The only survivor of a dead city. Then we rejoice ... - Is it a gentleman or a lady? - He's a grandpa. - He's fat. - Gustav ... He's a bit agitated since the Führer decorated him ... He has a good head! C'mon C'mon! It's clothing, it's heavy. - Push, push, Papy! - But what do you think I'm doing? Stocking? It would be said. But what is he doing with that rope? - It's to help you. - Is he bad in the head or what? Help no more! Go find Bernadette. - Danke. - Do not move. ¡Bernadette! Ah Mrs Bourdelle, what a pleasure! He had had the honor of receiving the daughter, and now the mother. Two at once. I offer you a drink. No, I went up to look for Bernadette. We have to take clothes to the laundry. Ah, the delicate clothes. That is Paris. Mr. Bourdelle, do you want to come this way, bitte? What's this? - They're potatoes, it's obvious. - It's tobacco! Do you take me for an idiot? - Is prohibited! - It's for my personal use. - What is it, Klougklicht? - Ah, General, be on time. The man is trampling my tomatoes. It's tobacco, Herr General! Too much zeal, asshole! Go smoke on the patio! Look, you've made me nervous about the responsibilities you have. You Germans are not delicate. And I'm not saying that for you, General. Wait a minute, excuse me. What happens? An attempt has been made on General Muller's life . - He has dropped the Englishman, he is foolish. - Today everything goes wrong. Ladies, sorry, a setback. We'll see you later. It's not my fault. That, or no tobacco for a year. Oh it is, kaput el baúl. - It's nothing, just clothes. - It's very heavy, old rags. English embroidery. At last! A good moment. Here, my dear successor. I wish you a lot of happiness. No thanks! My bags were packed. I was going to go out, and I wanted to take a nap. The bomb was on the pillow. That Super Resistant, who is he? You will know him. Without him, Paris would be a paradise. That mask ... It looks like a puppet! Here it is! From the first day it attacks you, it is a sign. Welcome to Paris, General Spontz! In full front! It's provocative, isn't it? Stop laughing like a fool! I'll lock up that Super Resistant within 15 days! Museum of Gothic Art Closed Because Dunkirk ... excuse me, I don't want to speak ill of the English, but they are run like cowards. And Mers El Kebir, wasn't it treason? Are you able to remove the bullet from the foot? Papy was a vet. It will be right. And yet I like England, I used to play rugby. I even had a relationship with a cousin of the royal family ... I'm saying no more, French prudence. I had a comrade in Tobruk, they gave him a bad cure, gangrene, ... they cut off his leg. - Yes, sometimes it happens. But what is the diva doing with the instruments now? - Mom? - Fool! You scared me. But what are you doing here? - Papy is operating on an Englishman in the cave. -That? - Thanks for your speed, mamina. Has died. -That? It is not a joke. You will need to hold him. Let's cut the steak. It's Sunday. Papy, what things have ... - That's right Papy, you're exaggerating. - But I'm dreaming! Have you brought an Englishman? Do you know how many Germans are in this house? Enough, Guy-Hubert! If you are afraid, you can go! - How did you get here? - Mom and I have brought it. - A collaborator was uploaded. - That? That's too much! A criminal! And they bring it to you! You don't say "she" when she is the mother. - And you only whistle in the stables. - The age of private classes is over. - Now we talk about more important things. - Silence! I am going to operate. Put this in your mouth so you don't scream. Wait. Wouldn't you have a glass of alcohol? That would help me. I'm sorry. Since 40 we have nothing. - Yes, I know where it is. - You will not operate on this one! We'd be in big trouble! Bernadette, come back immediately! Are you crazy or what? Spontz has a bottle of snaps. What we have to do is find a doctor. Where's Colette? He's at Jean's house. It is more prudent. Bernadette, you can't go in where Spontz. Help me search, Guy-Hubert! It is a leather bottle. No! I won't touch anything! You will have us shot like spies. What a coward! Coward, and proud to be! - Let's go! -Let me! - You hurt my shoulder! Kind of blond cow! Tomorrow at six. And not one more noise. I don't want to hear a fly fly! - What's going on? - It's me, General. Mom has gotten cold and was looking for some alcohol to make her a punch. You have done well. It would have been better to turn on the light. The bottle is there. As you had offered me a moment ago, with all the kindness, ... I have abused, I confess. - Nothing happens. A beautiful woman is allowed everything. Also, Parisians have a kind of indefinable charm. Who has rummaged my suitcase? Sorry, General, I must have scrambled everything. Bernadette... Bernadette ... do you want to answer me honestly? How about my pajamas? - I beg your pardon, General. - Horrible, huh? They force us to buy them in greenish or burgundy brown. - What a horor! - Yeah, I guess, those are ... But you know, general, what is worth in man is man. Not the dress. Thank you. Gustav, I think I've been ripped off. Anyway! You are in the same situation as I am. What, Gustav? Do you fight alone? Has the cat scratched you? I had to defend myself, he was not going to leave me! Daddy, don't be sadistic! Wait for him to drink a glass of alcohol. She is a little woman. On the 14th I operated on a Romanian's eye with a spoon. The guy was delighted. It always corresponds. And don't blow my head, please! - Hush Papy, Spontz is back! - I'll make Easter for that one! - On foot, on horseback, and by car. - Listen, I'm going to make noise ... ... so the moans will not be heard. - That's. Close your cuffs. I'm not sure that will do much good, Héléna. It makes the sick man nervous and will bring down the Germans. Enough, it's hateful! Jean-Robert ... flute ... What are these childish things about? Here, drink. Give it to me. I will do. Useless! If you want to make a butcher shop, it's up to you. That is precisely why. I'm going to get the bullet out at once. It is better for women to turn. If I'm not mistaken, I have brought the alcohol for nothing. It is the third bullet that I take out. It is getting more and more painful. - Open, open! - Hurry up, English! I was at the Taboo with Jean and a nice guy with a mustache has offered me a pins. He has asked us a lot of questions. Liar, you told me you'd go to Jean's house. I think it was the Gestapo! Take it easy, Mrs Bourdelle, it's the French police. Now "ausweis", documents, please. Hurry! - What's wrong, I don't understand ... - It's useless to care ... I said: "ausweis"! While you're there, add the bread tickets . Let them gently drop to the ground. Catch them, they're on the table ... Don't you remember me, chick? The opera in 41 ... Do you remember the Soisson vase? Excuse me, but when you are nervous, this calms down. No longer mistreating janitors? Ramirez has moved up through graduation. I have waited for this moment! Now they will find out! There is a small error. We have always recognized your many successes, Rami. Mr. Ramirez! It's over! Rami doesn't exist! Where is the guy they hide? - What type, Mr. Ramirez? - Shut your mouth! The brat began to tell us a very interesting story. - But he left us at the best time. - What does it mean? I would like to know the end. You know what I mean? - Leave my mother! - You have won, you whore! It is you I want to question. Do you speak or do I prepare a bath for you? What happens? Who is tortured here? Shut your mouth! Hands on your head! Tell me your name! Spontz. General Spontz. Forgive me, my general, I took you for another. - Who are you? - Adolfo Ramirez, Gestapo. Listen, my general, I don't quite understand ... don't you know each other? You said it was your order. - Did you say that, toad? - No, my general, lie how you breathe! - What am I lying? All are witnesses! - We've all heard it. Oh I see. Mr. fantastic. How dare you come here with your horde of filthy rats? My general, I'm from the Gestapo. I'm doing an investigation, I'm just doing my duty. And I don't know if you meet yours. And he gives me advice ... Very good. Bring your cheek closer, I'm going to give you a lesson for memory. Repeat with me: "I am a donkey." I am a donkey! "I think all the terrorists are found in the German generals." - It's that girl ... - Shut up! The bread tickets, my general. - Yes, he stole our bread tickets. - Oh, also a thief, huh? - Give them back! - Are here. The Gestapo is not easily fooled. I'm going to make a report! Don' trust him! He does not know who I am! I can do everything! How scary! I can do everything! Tomorrow the commendation will call my office. Poor fool! You don't have an office! I will have one! And he's pointing his gun at me! I'm sorry for this unfortunate incident. I hate people who betray their country. - Thank you, General Ponche. - Spontz. General Spontz. Well, I'm going to leave you. - Goethe! - no! Corneieu. Great, general! Good afternoon. Okay Bernadette, you gave it to Spontz. If giving it to her means being polite to someone who just saved us ...! The color of pajamas is what saves us. It's English, get it out of there! It's okay? I prohibited a search for me at my home. I know, boss, but there's a ruckus. 50 hostages have been taken. - They're going to kill them at dawn. - Dogs, cowards ... - Is trembling. He is cold? - I'm not afraid. Me too, but I don't show it. It would give them great pleasure. Think of France. It will make you swallow the pill. I'm wrecked, and the pill doesn't pass. What bothers me is that I had a row with Mireille. Who is Mireille? His wife? He is my boss in the network. I only have her. I was hoping to make up tonight. I'm going to die being angry. It's stupid. It won't be any consolation, but I'm going to clap her for a badly placed sign. - A what? - A pharmacy sign. I can't explain it to you. Here's the job! And don't forget that your deliverer is Super Resistant. Now a hat is going to pass before you . Be generous and think of your less fortunate comrades . For France, and thanks in advance. - Come on, give me the hats. - There is not. - What do you mean there are no hats? - But there are piggy banks. There you go, when you talk about pasta, you are not a person. I'm going home. Let me join your network, I have always wanted to participate in the Resistance. - Do I have to ask you on my knees? - Close the spout. It's a cover. Is he irresponsible or what? - Excuse me, I won't do it anymore, Fremontel. - No names! Don't you understand anything? I told him who it was because we were lost. But now I regret it! Nobody knows my true identity. My battle name is Felix, forget my real name and forget everything. Leave me alone! - You are very tough. - Hide. - That light! - It's amazing, every time I want serve the country, I am rebuked. It is systematic. Two years ago in Dreux it is impossible to find anyone. Felix? Felix? Wake up It's me, come on. I know a shortcut, follow me. - I'm wrong. - It's over. - What are you doing here? - I? Nothing, he took the air. - What's going on? - I don't know, Mamina. - Guy-Hubert was at the door. - I'm beginning to understand, Mom. Guy-Hubert was kicking out the Englishman. I'm doing it so as not to spoil your love affair with General Spontz, single. - What idyll? - Harry broke a tooth. Did you bring English here with Spontz on top? Please Michel, if you've come back to talk nonsense, it's not worth it. But mum, do you know where I come from? We don't want to know, Michel. Cowards have no voice. So is. Listen? Put me on Mr. Fremontel. - Do not hang up. - Yes thanks. - Hey, Fremontel? - Say, this is Fremontel. The cook shakes the noodles. I repeat: the cook shakes the noodles. And the Japanese are the cause of the rise of China. Are you already in Paris, Colonel? Yes, but I'm going back to London tonight . The Gestapo follows me closely. You have to advance the meeting of which I speak. - No way, this is full of Germans! - No choice. Until now. Go find Mireille. It was Colonel Vincent. So fat Churchill put a cigar in his beak he walks into de Gaulle's office and yells "pui pui". It is evil for the English. Excuse me, I'll be right back. - What are you doing here? - Colonel Vincent wants to see you. It is in Meudon. You have to come right away. He had told Felix he couldn't before 4 hours. You know I have work on Tuesdays. The colonel wants to see you before he goes to London, it is necessary. Necessary? I am in the middle of work, I am not going to leave my client halfway. - Mr. Hubert ... Finish. - Yes I'm going! Well, tell him I'll go when I can. But don't let me get mad. Problems! He can't come, he has people in his hair salon But who does he think is the Super Resistant? Put this on. - This? -No choice. General von Krapp has just arrived. I have assured you that I would be the only customer today, and with this he will take him for a servant. - Michel! Fast! - Wait for me. Fremontel, is that the resistant you told me about? The one who was to be shot with you. - Yes it's him. -He is the owner of a club in Meudon, "Le Marquis". We're going to take Harry to him, and if he's tough he'll handle it. Don't even think about it. That guy is a top dog, he can't be bothered. - We can compromise. - He's a professional, he has a habit. Plus we can't have Harry here. No, but listen Mamina ... - I don't have much confidence with him ... - You said you knew him ... ... since the beginning of the war. - Yes, but it was a saying. - Hey, that's my suit. - Very good, Michel, from time to time you do some service. We will go through the garden. I have found the key. - Well, it's here. - I repeat, I risk not being well received, Because this guy is charming, but he makes me nervous What's up, Michel? Are you scared? Do you want me to go? No, what's up. I'm coming. I'll tell him. Hey, open up! I have a cramp! - Mom, Harry is going to suffocate! - Shut, the baritone Poulac spent two hours in his trunk before singing Wonderfully, and believe me, asking for your money was not breathless. It's not that he has bad will, but I can't go in there, he's in disguise. But what story is that? - He's right, he's in disguise. - You see, he was annoyed. Let's go. Michel! There will be a solution. Mireille, there's a guy asking about Felix. If you saw his pint ... I am coming right away. Come this way, asshole. I have a feeling I was wrong. Isn't it a costume ball? - Of course not. - Well, it's really me. I absolutely must see Felix. - No, you have to go. - Last night we were together, ... it was not long before they shot us. - Between. - At least you can see me. - I will see what I can do. - And take that off. It's ridiculous! - The mustache too? Well of course. Thanks for your show. I have nothing else to do. This is Colonel Vincent. Super Resistant. - Should I call him Super or Resistant? - Call me Super. Nothing else. There is not a minute to waste. We are sitting on a powder keg. Do you know that we are gathering all the networks? Are you ready to join? - Yes, if you ask politely. - Please! But there's a little problem. The general appreciates your action, but has seen your photo with his costume, and I'm not going to lie to him ... He said "how crappy". - Mr. Felix, excuse me ... - Get out of here! I have to deliver an Englishman! We can't hide anymore! - An English? - Let him go! - Who? Can not be! I live with Spontz, we can't hide it any longer! Spontz? Do you live with Spotz? Well, to tell the truth he lives with us. - Abbreviate! -It is not interesting. - It has no interest. - Get him out, fuck Spontz! - Nothing about that. We totally disagree. There we have a major stumbling block. Get that guy out, he's an asshole. - Hey, what lets you say that? - Do you know this man? No, and I have no interest in meeting you. You make judgments too hasty, Mr. Super Resistant. - Super Resistant! - Good for the discretion! Vincent, professional, thank you. - Ah, Super Resistant, you are like a mouse! -That will be you! Cover me! Call the Germans! They are there! - Disarm the French! - This guy is an asshole! You kill yourself for stopping the terrorists, and he shoots me in the leg! Do you have shit in your eyes, asshole? I'll be right back. The brakes are on. Come on, hurry! - Michel, Michel! - But what is he doing there? Quick, over here. I have come to find you. Do not touch me! Quick boss, there's an open car! - And Fremontel? - Know the site, it will be fixed. What does Super do, is he babia? Sorry for taking your car and at such a favorable time. Do not trust the appearance. I was taking care of him. Are they chased? Are you English? What are you doing here? - Will you marry her? - How? Now that you have stained your honor, I hope you repair it. What's the matter, Super? It has gone mad? Answer me, you kind of vicious! Filthy filthy! Nerve! Pig, you dirty traitor! Vicious! He has vice on his face! No more fussiness, in the name of France! In London we thought his costume was grotesque. But now I know that you are the grotesque . In addition to ineffective, and dangerous. I leave you alone, fix them as you can. Colonel, don't leave! It's crazy! - You can't go looking that way. - Do not advise on dresses! Better, we don't need him. - It's a connecting rod, boss! - What a mess! Well. Take this young woman home and bring English to safety. I'm going. At last I am in the service of Germany! And we at the service of England as our uniforms show. And what is this, Lorraine's cross? You're doing a fool! I'm going to take the license plates! There will be a report of aúpa! Oh, it hurts my leg! You will find out! I will not disturb? Not at all. Today I cannot catch Radio Paris. I take a quiet time to hear a little music. music. I know you think that the habit does not make the monk, but ... makes you younger, doesn't it? Smile! I like his smile. - It bothers me, General. - You are very beautiful. I beg you... Bernadette, there is no need to be ashamed to be cheerful. - I don't know anything, I don't know. - Come on, you have to laugh, have fun. Look, a good joke for you: He was a madman painting the ceiling, Another madman arrives and says: "Hold on to the brush that will take me up the ladder." What happens? Have I hurt her? No, general, it is not about you. It was my father's favorite joke. Sorry, I did not know. I've spoiled the weather. Listen to Strauss the waltz. Do you want to dance to make me forgive? - I dance very badly. - "Bitte!" Between two waltzes, I would like to say a few words to you, Herr General Spontz. Do you know "Mombambre"? - "Bitte?" - The castle "Momembre". - Oh yeah, Montbreuse. Excellent. "Yes," Montbreuse. Absolute security. - In the countryside. - Yes, in the countryside. He asked me to summon Von Klount ... and Von Rountzek as well ... He has asked me to summon all the generals. - Yeah, I won't. - Is he coming personally? Hitler has given him all the powers. He has named him "Reichminister" and also shows too much zeal. He has gone into a rage because of you. He says you are inept. And talk about demoting him in the next session. You don't realize, Herr Haufmann, I do my best! This Super Resistant is inaccessible! You will tell him personally tonight. You will surely appreciate it. Reassure yourself. He will not be the only one punished. There are going to be changes on the Eastern front . Perhaps worse ... No more fighting in Paris. - Klougklicht! Does this make you laugh? - "No, general!" I'm done... - If I may, General. - That? My brother-in-law works as a chauffeur with Marshal Goering. Klougklicht, I don't give a damn. Göring was also going to have problems. You know, because of that troop train. Well, he has received it in an extraordinary way , with music, women and everything. In the end they were drunk and colleagues like pigs. Not only did he avoid the fight but he has got two additional trains. Klougklicht, you gave me an idea. Find right away a list of the best shows in Paris, let's go! - "Ja, herr general!" - Klougklicht... -"Ja!" I need a hairdresser. Bring up Madame's son. - The one who works with the comb. - Here I am, my general. All right, at least it's fast. - How should I cut it, General? - Short, very short. I want to be very clean. Sorry, this is a horrible mistake. A mistake ... It is a great bullshit! Yes, sir, there are French and French. One kills himself for getting reports and is shot in the leg. - Shit! - Mr. Ramirez. What do you tell me? Here it is! Quick, for the shovels and picks! I have you! It is done! It has rejuvenated him a lot, he seems his son. - But I don't have children. - It's a saying. Today is going to turn a lot of people. Avoid talking heads at this time. That? An excellent Belgian magician: Mandragón. - Read the future in the foam of the beer. - Ah, very funny. - Shall I leave the dye, General? - Yes, leave it there. Here on the dresser. - It's impeccable, General! - Instead of doing the monosabio, Take care to find me the best Bordeaux bottles. General, the iron is on your clothes, if you like I'll take it off. Yes thanks. - Goodbye! - Super! He's gone! There has to be a trigger ... Don't come back, mum! I'm as sorry as you are about what happened to Colette, but ... that won't change anything. - Do not remove the knife on the sore. - Nothing proves they were arrested. - But the car is gone. Please! If the family is in danger, our duty is to be with it. But that is very easy. When you are interested I am one of the family, ... but I'm usually the last monkey. - I believe you are Bernadette's boyfriend. Yes, Bernadette ... She has been making me wait for two years , he loved Colette. - I beg your pardon, mamina. - At last, we were restless. - You gave us a hard time! - Oh mom, you are here! What a fear I was! Colette couldn't find anything better than to drive off without warning. - But mom ... - I've told you a hundred times: ... I don't want you to drive without a license. - Michel, there is a message for you. From a certain Colonel Vincent. He waits for you at the church on Montand Street. He seemed to be very scared. Colonel Vincent! - Shut up! Are you crazy? - It's me, Taupin! I've ended up hiding here. They all bothered me. Ready to help France? Have you crossed Paris looking like that? That Super Resistant pig dumped me like a rude. I'll talk about him in London. You are going to find out what a comb is worth. It is criminal. They could have arrested him. I brought you a time bomb, it 's for Spontz. Latest discovery of the intelligence service , reduced to the maximum. The minute hand ... ...light. An hour late at the most. - Understood. - Tell me ... what size do you wear? - How? - What size pants? - Ah no, you are too big. Courage, my friend, and good food. I will speak of you to de Gaulle personally. - Thank you. - And don't show yourself around looking like that. What you need to hear! Did you call us, General? Ladies, what are you going to do tonight? Bluntly. I'm soldier. I have a small favor to ask of you. I am sorry for you, General, but it is a matter of honor. I swore on my husband's grave that I would not sing for the Germans. Thank you very much, Mrs. Bourdelle. I'll probably end up in Irkutsk ... with frozen feet. - I did not force you to wage war, General. The one who sows winds, reaps storms. That's the truth, general. What a mess of a Latin country! You do a favor and get spit in your face! And this griffin that resists me, is going to find out! - General? - What's going on? - Ah, it's you. - General... I have made a very painful decision. But I can't tell you anything before the war is over. I appreciate you coming up to tell me that. That does not detract from affection between you and me. Between enemies there may be affection. I'm glad you understood me. - What does it mean? - Your burning neck drives me crazy ... the blood hits my temples. What's going on! - Excuse me, General! "My God, he saw us!" - What are you doing there, spying? - I have not seen anything! Open up! I was passing by ... Open up! Excuse me, general! I'm following Super Resistant since this morning, ... I have discovered a passage with a train! - What train, you filthy peeping Tom? There is a train! And a secret passage that leads to the museum of Gothic art! This revolves, I'm going to show you. It is true! This turns! They are behind there! Open up! - General, you have dirty your uniform! - You'll pay me, bitch! Threats, asshole? I'm going to calm you down! General, it's too much. It's going to drown him. I'll dry it! - I have found a beautiful dryer! - I beg you, you are going to burn him! You're wrong, Spontz, I'll tear it apart! - Get out of here! - You scoundrel! I'm going to leave you, general. Would you like me to find some mineral to clean your suit? That's! Outside! I'm sorry, Bernadette, I think I'm forced to do a little blackmail. I'm afraid this impromptu discovery is going to force your mother to go sing to Mombreuse. Depart in an hour! - But what are they doing here? -The Gestapo found a subway in the baths. - You have to flee. - Come at a good time. You are an ace! What are those clothes? Is it Ash Tuesday? - You're going to have us all arrested. - We cannot walk away like thieves, We owe Hermann an explanation. That hideous German? Are you kidding! He is a good man. Not everything is black or white. Let's go quickly! I have to blow up the barrack. Ms. Bourdelle, aren't you ready? The car waits. Yes, we are coming, General. Bernadette, now I'm sending for your cello. Mr. Taupin, what is that costume? - It's for classical music. - Oh, I understand. Come on, Mrs. Bourdelle. Ma'am, do you want to follow me? - Bernadette! - "You're welcome". No, thanks, I'm wearing it. - Michel, is he there? - Leave me alone. They will notice me! He cannot explode the bomb, there are many innocents. Everything is planned, my dear. At 10 the show is over and they leave. Mamina asked Spontz. Only the generals will stay in the room. And at 10:15, fireworks, signed Michel Taupin. - I have an appointment with history. - What if there is a delay? We will all die. You are very childish, Michel. Of course, he tries to save his little friend Spontz. Do you think I haven't seen your affairs with the general? Michel, I have the solution. He's going to put the bomb under the table. Look, the little door down there, down the corridor that leads to the toilets. In a minute I will try to entertain you. You have 30 seconds ... to slide under the tablecloth. Good luck. -Thank you. His insinuations are degrading. It's all over between us, Michel. I am sorry that I suffer. Very good! Very good music! What fun. How nice! Very clever! We like! Ma'am, will you come to the podium, please? Lovely, everything perfect. - I want a coffee. - "Ha, Herr General!" Beautiful animal. - General, do you have a moment to choose the pieces? -Sure. We plan to start with the Ave Maria de Gounod. It is simple to center, ... is solemn, without being heavy. - Yeah, but wouldn't it have a waltz like the Blue Danube or Lili Marleen? - Well, I can sing "Le petit vin blanc". - Ah, don't be offended ma'am, I wanted something simply animated. Would you like a glass of champagne ... "from before the war", to forgive me? -No thanks. Admirable. His voice is crystal clear . He has broken glasses. - The Gestapo is in the air. - Mercy. Spontz took your mother and Bernadette to Mombreuse. They were waiting for you. It seems worried. Is it the tunnel that worries you? Not at all, general. I think of something else, sad things. Come on, don't be ashamed of your feelings. - One day, the war will end. - Street. Unfortunately, some destinations do not cross. Bernadette, you confuse honor with puritanism. It can be both modern and decent. One little kiss, he has never killed anyone. - Hermann! -Klougklicht! Why do you make it so familiar? He is there! Come on, to your instruments! And play loud! Reichminister von Apfelstrudel is here! Sorry, general. I mean it's there in the garden behind. This flat view is depressing. No? I've had a dreadful journey. Especially my leg. - Aftermath of his attack ... - Shut up, Spontz! That is the past. - The traitors have paid. - Excuse me! - How is the Führer? - Busted like me, and he is not very friendly to you. Come on, to work, Spontz. Leave me! I can fix myself. It has made amazing progress. Intensive education, fierce will and look at the result ... Don't you prefer the front door? The ladder is smoother. It doesn't matter, I like exercise. What is this? - Well, I mean ... it's champagne. - Made in Reims. Whoops. They didn't have a party for me, did they? - No ... - You're not as stupid as Göring. He tried to cajole me with a grotesque party last week. He still remembers my reprimands. Only the friendship that he dispenses our Führer has saved him. Let your brother-in-law come! What a tough ladder. What a joke, and I climb it like a kid. ¡Spontz, Spontz! This is a disaster. You can't hear anything! Am I speaking for the deaf? Stop that music! I can't take that infectious cacophony anymore ! I'm going to end up distributing cyanide bonbons to everyone and so there will be less noise. Bernadette, we're leaving. They have never spoken to me like this. What happened? This is the first time I've been interrupted. Even his Führer in 33 stood in line to hear me. It will not be a subordinate like you who gives me lessons. - Who is that fat woman? - It's Madame Bourdelle, the famous opera singer. La Bourdelle as it is called here. Reich Minister Ludwig von Apfelstrudel. I like your frankness, ma'am. It's been ten years since nobody dares to be natural with me. It's different from all these crawling dwarves. Let me invite you to my table. Food threatens to be moved. It's not possible. The pump is ready. What, don't you eat? No appetite? Depression does not solve problems. You have to be optimistic. Not so, Ms. Bidelle? - Bourdelle. Elena Bourdelle, please. - Excuse me. I'm going to call him Bu-Bu. This way I will avoid regrettable mistakes. I hate to mess up names. On the other hand, I hate everything, Ms. Bu. When he has come out of 28 attacks like me, he becomes a bit harsh. You can't be bitter all your life, Marshal. You have to be distracted. Exactly what he told our Führer the day before yesterday : "Comrade, you will have to smile one day." By dint of pouting you will end up in a bunker flamed like a frankfurter . All the musicians are gone, Michel. All arranged with the music. - What's wrong, you don't like music, miss? -Yes. No, she is surprised. Well, nice to have dinner with German generals. Especially with someone close to Hitler. Have you known him for a long time? Who, Adolf? He is my half brother. At first he tried to kidnap me as in "The Iron Mask", but as an old man he has become more accommodating. On the other hand, Ms. Bu, it is I who wrote "Mein Kampf". Wait for me here. I am proud of my grandson. Wait for me here. If something happens, get out. I'm going with you, I won't leave you. Even as a quarterback, I have no right but to the 25% supplement, also of course, 10% ... and 20% to which every wage earner is entitled ... And that idiot Von Riventrop, he wanted to put the professional expenses ... at 5,000 marks per year. What do you think, Ms. Bu? At this time I am no longer standing. With the curfew we don't have the habit of going to bed so late. You don't like the company of the Germans? Give me another hour to convince you that we are civilized people. Bravo Papy, flexible as a reed. Ah well, come over, Mrs Pourtelle. Do not be afraid. Did you want to speak to me in private? Yes ... Sit down ... I hate being alone. It gives me a certain longing. Yes, okay, but just a minute, because I think we have to go. What is going to happen? We are lost. You say "lost", Mr. Taupin? - No, I mean, the partridge is delicious. - Ah, partridge, yes. You remind me of a little Bavarian woman I knew very well. Frida. Oh beautiful woman. Now he's doing a sexy-comedic number in Munich. It's not very delicate ... Ride a rubber banana ... and bounces all over the cabaret scene. All accompanied by harps. It is a bit vulgar but you have fun. One is puffed up with bacon and ham and drunk from beer mugs. And it ends in a screaming spree at the zip lines or vomiting all over the place. The evening is not wasted. It must be charming. Those evenings drive me crazy. Well, it's over. "Fertig, kaputt" ... She is with another ... and I languish in the sad autumn. Is it said like this? When you are sad, you allow everything. You know, a great conqueror is a lonely man, always. Look at your Napoleon who wrote exciting letters to Josefina, while Moscow burned. And I sometimes feel like a foreigner who is far from home and wants to yell at a woman ... "I haven't changed" by Julio Iglesias Herr Reichminister, here are the eggs if you want to eat them hot. They are ostrich eggs, fresh from this morning. - I think you'll like them. - Sure, but fast, we're in a hurry. Yes quickly. 1,2,3,4,5 ... The egg is the apple of the cock. Excuse the question, Reichminister, how do you get wet in them? It is very clear: you take a whole bar , spread it at will ... y se mine. My slice has fallen off. I'm going to get it. He finally likes this. With you, marshal, it has to be that way. Come on, Mrs Bourdelle, the evening went perfectly until now. Don't spoil it with your bad mood. Stand back! I have an "ausweis"! Come on guys, to your posts! I'm not in a bad mood. It's a dash of humor, that is. Ah, humor ... It's what I prefer ... along with the infantry and the heavy men. Get up from there, Mr. Terrorist! I am responsible. Excuse me, Mamina. I have a special nose for discovering terrorists. It will be a lesson for some. Let me pass! "Heil"! I have discovered who is Super Resistant. Look, it's him! It's ridiculous. I am Michel Taupin, a Latin teacher. - None of that, it's him! Look! - Who is this new attraction? Adolfo Ramirez, French Gestapo. Heil Hitler! I have dismantled the entire Super Resistant network . His hiding place, the little train ... Are you going to decorate me? Stop him! Let them shoot him with the other French! Don't make me stop, I'm a traitor! I asked for! I'm on your side! I have given up almost everyone! I'm barely French! Reichminister, you cannot convict without studying the report. You have to make a judgment in order! Agree. Because it's about you. Stop Spontz! He will be shot with the other French! Well done! He burned my neck with an iron. He is a traitor! - Lie! - There is only one traitor in this room! - And it's you, Ramirez! - Super Resistant! They want to know my name, see my face ... I am the devil! Is he! The one I said! Super Resistant! Surprised, Apfel? Did you know the judgment of God, wretch? It is a man-to-man combat. I am amused a lot. I have been a weapons master. They called me the d'Artagnan of Cologne. Well, d'Artagnan, let's both go! My leg! - Coward, run away! - Nothing about that! Guards, seize him! Too late, we have won! Well done, Papy! - My son! - It's Guy-Hubert! - Please don't shoot! I'm a hostage! -I also! Adolfo Ramirez and von Apfelstrudel were run over hours later ... by a German truck, as they tried to free each other from their bonds, writhing in the road. The driver stated: "I thought it was an animal. It scared me and I stepped on the gas." The Bourdelle family returned to the Resistance and ended the war brilliantly with weapons in hand. In August '44, next to General Leclerc, Super Resistant and Michel Taupin, participated in the liberation of Paris. I have to tell you, that we have all seen here on set and with great attention this movie that describes one of the most difficult and painful times in our history. And if we have, it is because everyone around me They are the main actors of the drama that we have just experienced on the screen. And I'd like to introduce them to you again before I give you the floor. I will start with Mrs. Bernadette Bourdelle, daughter of the famous singer Héléna Bourdelle. His brother, Guy-Hubert Bourdelle, who we will know about immediately whether or not it was Super Resistant. Mr. Ramirez Jr., son of Adolfo Ramirez and that he has come especially from Bolivia to participate in this debate. General Spontz who resided at the Bourdelle's in Paris ... and Michel Taupin, minister of former combatants, and that he has seen fit to accept participation in this great broadcast. It is a pleasure for me to come simply, without stories, ... with my dear comrades. - Do you have any comments? - I wanted to say ... - Wait, everyone their turn. - First, Mr. Minister. - I'm totally shocked. Reality has been presented to us in a hideously caricatured way, not to mention grotesque. I pass over the story of Hitler's half brother, in very bad taste, to go straight to my character. Who is presented as a fickle man on the edge of disability. Let's be serious, even if it is only out of respect for those who see us, If I have been appointed minister of the former combatants, it is not by chance. As for the Bourdelle family, I had the great privilege of rubbing shoulders with them. And when one knows what the work of this family has really meant during the war and the difficulty of living at this time, one finds that this movie is nothing but a birria, And I'm surprised, Mr. Jerome, that TV has chosen ... ...this movie. - Everything is false, from A to Z! The characters are ridiculous. The minister complains, and what should I say? Anyway, what is that puppet that is sometimes soft, other times provocative, and others do not know well? The costume that has been attributed to me is delightful ...! Mr. Ramirez, do you want to intervene? Mr. Ramirez, one question: do you speak French? - Yes why? - If so, the debate will gain in clarity. - Well, I'll speak in French. - What is this masquerade? I want to remember that my father had not joined the Gestapo, but to infiltrate inside. He was a double agent. Mr. Ramirez, if you were a double agent, then I am a KGB agent. Please, were you Super Resistant or not ? I have nothing to do with that operetta superman. I was a trainee hairdresser at Madeleine, I had a lot of work, and I had to carry two or three messages for the Resistance, that was it. - We're not going to make a world of it. - No, Mr. Bourdelle is much more modest and that honors him, but it is true that he was a member of an active network, of course no mask, but he was well known in the Resistance ... with the name of Esparadrapo. - Sticking plaster? That is past history. It no longer interests the young, what they need now is muscular and virile heroes, like Rocky. "Esparadrapo" ... why in Roudoudou Raplaplá? When the painful hours of France have been lived , from Montoir to Omaha Beach, - Believe me ... - Please, Mr. Ramirez. It seems that you have to be a minister to have the floor in this debate! If that bothers you, what you have to do is be a minister! - How vulgar! - Please calm down. - "Bitte" ... I never participated in this meeting of the SS in the castle of Montbreuse. And on the other hand, I was part of the Wehrmacht, I remember, and around that time I was doing a liver cure in Louchon. My general, you have listened to the questions of the spectators, they would want to know whether or not he married Bernadette Bourdelle after the war. I personally don't like this question . I'd rather have it done on my wife. Mrs. Bourdelle, do you want to answer this question? What does this have to do with the debate on the Resistance? Sorry, it's private. It is private! I'm sorry, but you have heard it, there are many who want to know if you married General Spontz. The general and I were married in May '52, in Vienna. And I must say that I do not understand all this well , because the film confuses my story and that of my sister Colette, who indeed ... married Mr. McBarrett. - The English aviator? They currently live very happily in Sussex, where they have a breeding of 20 thousand pigs, and if they are not present here it is because animals require, Mr. Ramirez, very careful. You have to scratch their skin every day, and in this trade they have no holidays. In any case, there they are on the screen. Harry the English aviator, and Colette McBarrett. There was talk a moment ago of a wedding held in May 52 ... Exactly, Mr. Ramirez. It is that this marriage had been consummated long ago ... I remember how my father told us laughing, how he had surprised Spontz and Mrs. Bourdelle in the kitchen in a somewhat compromised posture. You weren't very dressed ... You disgust me, you dirty liar! Make up something else! I have no need. Everything is made up. Let's look at La Bourdelle, the fat woman ... ... the singer. In the film she is presented with the features of a great singer international, a diva, who refuses to sing for the SS. He worked six nightclubs in Pigalle to end up at the One-Two-Two at 6 with the nose hanging. So far we have come! I leave! - Enough, gentlemen! - My general ... I also affirm that the minister present here put himself in his pocket two million francs in gold that André Legouen had given to the Resistance. Watch out Ramirez, don't go too far! Let's get out of this masquerade! What a job you have! - It's a mistake for you to leave. - The press is rotten! - Give me the keys to the Audi! - You have them. - No, you have them, cretin! - Mr. Jerome, I have been called into question, ... I demand the right to respond! - Stop it, Mr. Ramirez! You've been looking down on everyone for a long time ! I wonder what I'm doing here! And watch out, because I'm going to scream really loud! Gentlemen, could you not continue this debate calmly and with dignity? And I haven't said everything! I know it was Super Resistant, who coldly strangled Enrique with his bare hands because he was sleeping with his sister Colette! Enough, enough! It is a shame! There are no words to say what you are, Ramirez! There is only one word: fag! - No, Mr. Bourdelle, be correct. - Nothing else has occurred to me. - Take back what you just said! - Now you're going to find out, pig! Gentlemen, please! Take, disgusting, from the Government! This is the end, this is how this broadcast ends.
