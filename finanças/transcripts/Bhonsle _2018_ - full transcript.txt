Bhonsle saheb. Bhonsle saheb... - Saheb... Leaving? - Saheb... about my extension - Bhonsle Saheb... You know these things take time... But don't you worry... I'll harass Tawde sir everyday till he does something about it... Ok saheb. See you. Saheb, please... Bhonsle kaka... namaskar. Enough now! It's time to take things into our own hands. We Marathis need to celebrate our Ganpati festival separately this year Only Marathis will bring in the Ganpati idol this year. Biharis not allowed. Speak of the devil. I'll get rid of these Biharis from Churchill chawl once and for all. Our real work starts tomorrow. We'll go from house to house collecting donations. Now go sleep. Religious song on radio Religious song on radio "The Municipality can supply water to 9 million people... But Mumbai has 20 million now. Most of them are Bihari outsiders. Now because of them our Marathi brothers are going thirsty." Religious song on radio What's Bhonsle doing at home? Looks like they retired him. (Police wireless crackle) Sawant, take your cup. Sawant, this is Bhonsle saheb. Sawant's the newbie. Saheb, I really missed your tea. I tried to speak to Tawde sir today... Got another lecture. Your chai packs some punch saheb. Don't worry saheb... Tawde Sir's asked me to call him again in a couple of days... I'll let you know. See you soon. Let's go. That was the last bag. Pay up please. - What? That'll be a hundred. - What?! I'd said fifty. That's a lot of luggage you made us lug ma'am. - No no no... hundred's too much. What a pain! Make it eighty then. - No no. I don't have more than seventy. Here! God help us from these stingy outsiders. Hello... My name is Sita Prasad. We've just moved in next door... Thought I'd come and say hello. Okay. She went to say hello... to Bhonsle! Should've warned her! Namaskar kaka. What do you want? Our Ganpati festival's round the corner, so we wanted your support... I've done my bit. Ya, Kaka, you always do... It's just that this year we want only Marathis to celebrate Ganpati... Kaka you've served us Marathis all your life. It's time to stand together now - Dada! That Rajender - ! Aye... Bihari bastard! You Bihari scum! Don't you get it? We Marathis aren't celebrating with you people anymore... I heard you... we're organizing our own separate festival, so cool it. Do it where you come from, not here. - This is my home too - No it's not you Bihari fuck I'd warned you. I'd warned all of you! This... is... not... your... home. Lock the bastard up. This chawl belongs to us Marathis These fuckers think they can get away with this... You Biharis want a separate Ganpati this year? What's wrong with you Mhatre? When have we ever done that? Then beat some sense into your boy Rajender! You piece of shit, come here. I'll beat the hell out of you. Here I am slogging my ass off driving a cab all night and you want to play politics. For the first time in 25 years... I was made to feel like an outsider to this place yesterday... This Marathi-migrant nonsense will tear Mumbai apart, is that what you want? Why don't you ask Vilas that? No one questioned him when he went from house to house spouting his hateful crap Vilas is a thug. We don't waste our breath on thugs. Listen to me! We are decent folk in this chawl. But you seem to lack decency lately... Go do your thuggish shit elsewhere. Don't drag my name into the dirt. God bless you Bhau? Wait outside. We'll call you... Let him come... Bhau. You got arrested again? How do you expect me to trust you if you keep landing in jail? Sorry bhau. That Bihari dog Rajender really fucked my head up You need to win each Marathi heart in Churchill chawl... I'll show them bhau, I promise... They need to see that it's those Biharis who are the thugs, not you... I will... promise. Jobs, houses, even the food in Mumbai belong to our Marathi brothers... but guess who's hogging all of it? Those Bihari bastards... Now that's what you need to drill into each Marathi head I'll do just that bhau... you wait and watch. I'll change everything bhau, everything. Everything has already changed Vilas. Except you. Now get with the program... or get out. Go now. I'll wait outside... - Hurry up man. - Just a minute. Buddy? Take us to the mall? (giggles and whispers) (more giggling) "No jobs to migrants in Maharashtra state services! The Marathi Morcha Party threatens..." Sons of bitches. There isn't a single newspaper in our language there... only Marathi ones! That Shinde hasn't spent a rupee on newspapers all his life... but my old man Mishra pays a 110 bucks each month for his papers... ... and who to? To Shinde's bloody boy Amol! They put up things like this public library just to fuck with us. What do you want? Only the Vada? Yes. You're Lulloo no? Lalu... You're the new one right? Made any friends yet? No? Come here. You need friends to survive this city... - My sister will scold me - - I'll take care of it. Ismail... Govind... Pandey... and myself - Rajender. Let's solemnize this by gifting Lulloo Bihari a 'cutting'. I'll talk to your sister, don't worry. Aye Pandey, Lulloo's part of the Bihari Brigade now, no one touches him ok? You play carrom? No? Football? Cricket at least? Don't be scared, we're a team now. Didi's really going to scold me now Don't worry, you look pretty cool. I'll take care of it. What happened to you?! Everyone in the Bihari Brigade does this. Your brother is one of us now. I run the Brigade, on behalf of all the Biharis in the chawl. Hello. Er... Thank you. We're here to keep you safe in these treacherous times... If there's any problem, we'll help you... Okay then. Lulloo... See you later... The hospital's called me in urgently... they're short on nurses tonight. If you need me, just find Mishra uncle... and get him to call me on my cellphone. I've made you some porridge... And remember to fill water at 5 a.m. Didi...?! Lulloo... Come downstairs... Rajender bhaiya is calling you. Come no...! - I can't leave the house like this. - Don't worry, come. It's more fun at night... Mr. Lulloo, not hanging with your new buddies? Aye? Aren't we playing Carrom? As soon as we're done initiating you into the Brigade! A small job and then we will start. Hold this. Hold this! Do as I say! - Go on, throw it. - No. Please! Throw it... or I'll tell everyone you did this! Throw it Aye! What's going on there?! Run...! Look at what these rats have done now! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Not just our little library, they've sullied every Marathi's face! These fucking Biharis eat, fuck, earn all their money here... ...but send it back to their homes in Bihar! Before you know it all of Bihar will be here in Maharashtra... making babies and taking away everything that belongs to us! Jobs... shelter... food... Is there anything we haven't given them? But what have they given us in return?! JACKSHIT! Should we call the police? Police? What will the police do? The Police can't be everywhere Kaka. This is not their problem. I'll tell you who's done this. We can take care of this without the police. This is our problem. Yours... mine... this is his problem too... These outsiders get away with their bullshit because we Marathis are not united... I, Vilas Dhavle... swear before Churchill chawl today... ...the hand that dared to do this I will chop that hand into little bits... ...and offer it up to our lord here. Aye you Bihari fucks, I'm talking to you We'll toss each and every one of you back to where you came from... Only then will you guys understand, that this is our land... ...not your's. And I don't doubt we can achieve this... Because we have the support of Bhonsle Kaka... We don't need to fear these fucking rats... Bhonsle Kaka - our Marathi warrior...! We are proud to have you with us Bhonsle Kaka. Let go. - Sorry Kaka? - Let go. Kaka, we need you to show us the way Let go. Kaka, we need you to show us the way You must help your fellow Marathis. Just say the word kaka... ...and I swear, whatever you say will be done! This gutter's been lying uncovered for two years now, do something about it. He's right... My little one got dengue fever last month... - This gutter is a mosquito magnet - You're right kaka... I'll do something about it. There are rats also! You Biharis are the rats... I'll clean this chawl of all of you vermin once and for all! Come boys, let's clean it up... Aunty, you have to walk miles to the market no? I'll bring it to your doorstep, you watch. Granny your knees give you trouble no? I'll get those western commodes made in your loos here. So you can shit like a queen. Kaka trust me, I won't let you down. Bhau, I did exactly as you said, but they're dumb fucks in that chawl... ...they just don't get it. Vilas... I asked you to win them over, not go around bullying them. I have an even better idea bhau... ...we'll repaint that little public library? Just like your office... ...we'll write your name on top, in big bold letters... ...even stick a big photo of yours on it, what do you think? Wow! Vilas... That has to be your dumbest idea yet! I - I didn't understand bhau...! If you paint that library will anyone even remember that it had been blackened? They will forget... the event... and then you too. I don't see you changing at all. You need some brains to win hearts... but you seem to be seriously lacking... Politics is not your cup of tea. I strongly recommend you stick with that taxi. Jai Maharashtra. Got it bhau, just leave it to me now. You have Vilas Dhavle's word... I'll be there in a jiffy... yeah, leaving right away Jai Maharashtra. What happened bhau? I have to rush now... bhau needs me. You guys get going now... They forced me... What? That library... I didn't want to do it... I swear... I tried to stop them... But Rajender bhaiya forced me - Please... No! He'll throw me in jail...! He has something to tell you... That library - I-was-there-last-night - ! You did that? N-No - Then what were you doing there? Look, he's really sorry... ...he didn't mean to do it... they forced him... Don't do it again... or I'll have you arrested. (Police wireless crackle) Tawde sir's gone to Pune... He asked me to call again in a day or two. Any idea who did this? No. Should I go meet Tawde sir? No saheb. He might get annoyed... you won't like it. Sir there's some chaos at the Parel Ganpati. Bhonsle saheb, gotto go, duty calls. Oye! Bhonsle-ji! Bhonsle-ji! Bhonsle-ji! Come Mishra. (nervous chatter) Mhatre... get your taxi out. I've called Sita... she's on night duty...
