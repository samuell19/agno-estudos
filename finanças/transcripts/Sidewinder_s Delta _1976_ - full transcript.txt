Brianna and I can’t go back until we know whether Jemmy can hear those stones. As soon as we know if Jemmy can travel, we’ll use Bonnet’s gem to leave. As you said, it’s our ticket home. So if you have come recruitin’, you could not have found any better men in all the Carolinas. We’ll ride to Hillsborough with you. I hope you didn’t waste any good medicine on that coward. Powder burns were on his back. So whoever shot him, shot him at close range. No woman speaks to me like that. You can’t give away my money! What’s in those burlap bags? I dinna recall buying those in Woolam’s Creek. Peanuts. ‐ Peanuts? ‐ ‐ Why? The pigs dinna want for slops. Or do you, mean to make medicine out of them, Sassenach? No, sandwiches. Haven’t quite mastered ice cream yet, but I’ll be damned if Jemmy grows up without tasting peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. - ‐ Claire? - ‐ ‐ Dead. ‐ Aye, they all are. Why are they all in the house? Why didn’t they run outside when the fire started? It’s a bit strange. Because they were all dead before the fire started. I canna tell what killed them. There’s another one over here. I can tell you how this one died. - Indians? - Yeah, could be. Seems unusual. There’s only one arrow. Let’s all take a look about. See if anyone got away or is hidin’ in the woods. Anyone there? ‐ Is there anybody out there? - ‐ God. - Hello? Is anyone there? Dinna be afraid. Is there anybody out there? It’s safe now. - We’re here to help. - Jamie. Anyone? Is there? No. I’ll do it. It’s gonna be all right, sweetheart. Thou goest home this night to thy home of autumn, and of spring and of summer. Thou goest home this night to thy perpetual home, to thine eternal bed. To thine eternal slumber. Do you remember when I left to go back through the stones? You made me peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to sustain me on my travels. ‐ just wanted to make sure you had one last piece of home wherever you ended up. Can you take it? I bet you can take it. I bet you can. ‐ ‐ha! ‐ They were the most delicious things I’ve ever tasted. - ‐ I’m glad. - Ouch! It’s hot. - ‐ It’s hot? - ‐ ‐ Do you want it? ‐ No! No? But you wanted it a moment ago. I don’t want it anymore. He’s saying it’s hot? ‐ It is really warm. ‐ No, it’s not. Yer as daft as your wee lad. Ooh. Well, if it’s hot, give it back, baby. It’s broken. Jemmy. Can anyone else hear that? I can hear it! Dinna hear anything. Let me see this. That’s warm. It’s very warm. And a second ago, it was hot enough to crack. Cold as stone to me. Roger. He can travel. And will ya? Yeah. Come on, Jem. Come with me. All right, baby, just wait here for one second. Good boy. Well met, Mr. Fraser. Aye, I hope so, Mr. Brown. See you brought company. Mr. Fraser, you came to me for help. Now I have come to you. Now since the crown is no longer able to assure the safety of its colonists, we must take matters into our own hands. Now we have taken it upon ourselves to form a Committee of Safety to protect the good folk of Rowan County. Does the new governor ken about this? Governor Martin can’t officially sanction it. But he knows, and he certainly don’t want another uprising on his hands. You know, we’ve had word of violent attacks. Cabins burned, families killed. You have any news of such goings‐on here at the Ridge? Aye, we have. Came across a freshly burned cabin a few days ago. Maybe ten miles from Woolam’s Creek. The dead appeared to be a Dutch family. We laid their bodies to rest. That wound. Looks like it needs attending to. Come with me into my surgery. I’ll find some clean bandages to put on it. Well, that ain’t nothing. You go with her, brother. That wound’s festering by the smell of it. How’s little Bonnie doing? I trust she’s thriving with your niece’s family. She’s well enough. You have a nasty infection. How long ago did you do this? A few days. I know what you think of me, Mistress Fraser. You think I shot Morton. I’m not saying I had a hand in that. You’re not saying you didn’t either. You think a father’s got no right to seek justice for his daughter who’s been dishonored? It’s gotta be the work of the savages. We saw half a dozen cabins burned this month. It wasna Indians. And what makes you so sure? For one thing, no one was scalped. Even if they had been, the Indians aren’t the only ones who take scalps. True. The white man’s learned to take them too. Whoever it was, maybe something scared them off. You have men that answer to you. Will you and your son‐in‐law join us? We have enough men for two or three patrols. Corporal Hodgepile there commands one group. You and your men could form another. I appreciate the offer, but there’s a great deal to do here. I’ll need time to consider. You might recall, Colonel, when you came to me for men for your militia, I did not pause to consider. No, not for long. And Governor Tryon was grateful for your timely assistance. But fighting a war and maintaining law and order are two different things. Your famous whiskey still needs your constant attention, I suppose. Very well, Mr. Fraser. You think on it. You all best be vigilant. We can protect ourselves. Like I said, Mr. Brown, I’ll consider it. Mount up! Do ye really think they’ll go then? Brianna promised Roger as soon as they knew if Jemmy could travel. Are we going to talk about what happened? There’s not much we can say about the Browns. They, ‐‐ they do as they please. Not the Browns, Uncle. The opal. The Mohawk told us that Otter Tooth’s ghost appears to the one who has the stone. You found the opal. You said he appeared to you? Yes. But I‐‐ The Mohawk think that the one who has the stone has the power to see what will come to pass. They asked about you. After ye left. What did ye tell them? The truth. There isna anyone like my Auntie Claire. And ’tis true, the way ye speak and medicines, that you came to Uncle Jamie so suddenly after 20 years apart. And then there’s Brianna and Roger, who came from... I dinna ken where. As I told you once, I learned not to ask questions, but I have some for ye now. The Mohawk said that this belonged to Otter Tooth. I can understand some, but it’s in Latin. Does it mean anything to you? "I am. "I still exist. "Did I in that place between? "I do not know exactly when I am, "nor can I find out. "These people do not measure time "by any scale I know, "nor do I have the tongue to find out. But I know I am too late." My God. He wrote with a ballpoint pen. What’s a ballpoint pen? Who or... or what are ye? Ian... I come from another time. I come from the future. 200 years from now. I‐‐ I knew you were a fairy, Auntie. I’m not a fairy. Then you, Roger and Brianna‐‐ It’s all of ye. And you, you ken all this time, Uncle? Not many people would understand, so we kept it between ourselves. Did Murtagh ken? Aye. Aye, he did. Now so do you. You can come out. Mistress. Sir. Ulysses, how are you? I am well. Thank you, Mistress. My only complaint is boredom. Well, we brought you some food. I thought ye might find a use for this as well. I’ve been in places with naught but my own thoughts for company. It may distract you for a bit. Thank you, sir. My own thoughts are but... poor company. There’s a, Committee of Safety roaming about. At first I was afraid they might come looking for you, but I dinna think they heard about what happened at River Run. Now that I’m a murderer. You had no choice but to stop Mr. Forbes. You saved my auntie’s life. We’re verra grateful. No one will pardon me for killing a white man, even to save Mistress Cameron. Even so, I would do the same again given the chance. Have you given any thought to where you might go next? Yeah, it would be wise to leave North Carolina. Philadelphia maybe. Quakers dinna hold wi’ slavery In fact, sir, I‐‐ I’m not... exactly a‐‐a slave. What do you mean? It’s a document of manumission. Signed by Jocasta Cameron and... witnessed by Gerald Forbes? Ha. Yes. That was rather ironic, I suppose. So you’ve been a free man all this time. Yet‐‐ My mistress insisted upon manumitting me as soon as Mr. Cameron died. I chose not to leave her. Well, he’s finally... Asleep. Sorry. What do you think caused the opal to break when Jemmy held it? There must be something about time traveling or time travelers that triggers that energy. But it didn’t break with any of us. Maybe Jem is extra sensitive because both of his parents are time travelers. It might be proof that he is your biological son. All I’ve ever wanted was for us to be a family. And for us all to be safe. And we will be. Safer at least. We don’t need the opal. I have the rubies and the gem that Bonnet gave you. Bree... See, it’s not just the dangers. It’s living a life we were never meant to. I know. All right. Well, I guess we need to figure out what we’re gonna tell people. We can’t just go "poof." That’s exactly what we will do, isn’t it? If things go right. Yes. But I‐I don’t just wanna leave my parents to explain what’s happened to us. And I wanna be able to say bye to everyone. Aye, of course. I was thinking, we tell people I’ve got a job that doesn’t require shooting or stabbing. You know, north somewhere. Boston. New York. Boston would be best. People know I grew up there. We could tell them you’ll be a university professor. Which is the truth, just in a different century. Right. Best to stay as close to the truth as possible. Yeah. Leave within the month? You, have a visitor, sir. John? I wasn’t expecting you. ‐ Is everything all right? ‐ Quite all right. And William? He’s well. Still at school in London. Well, come, tell me more, but‐‐ Have Mr. Bug take his lordship’s baggage up to the guest chamber. ‐ Guest chamber? ‐ Aye. Yeah, we just finished the upstairs. Ye’ll be our first guest. ‐ I’m honored. ‐. I heard justice was served to Mr. Bonnet after all. It was. But, not by my hand. It was Brianna’s wish. He was sentenced, and the river took him. I’m sure she will rest easy now knowing she’ll never see his face again. So ye’re really leaving then, Cousin? Yes. I wish things were different, but they aren’t. Things are going to get worse here soon. There’s a war coming. Ye dinna have to be a‐‐ whatever you are‐‐to tell that. Anyone wi’ half an eye sees it. I’m happy for you. If it’s truly what you wish. But have you thought that maybe if you stayed, you could change things? I’m afraid what’s coming is a lot bigger than us. Auntie. You told me that you and Uncle Jamie thought you might stop Charles Stuart. Stop what you ken would be a terrible slaughter in the highlands. Well, we were able to prevent some of the men from Lallybroch dying at Culloden, but we weren’t able to stop the course of events, and the battle itself. Ian... it’s complicated. But there are things, smaller things that someone might be able to change. Something much smaller than a war, say... something between a man and his wife. I want to travel through the stones. I’m sorry. That won’t work. Well, why not? We think it’s something you’re born with. The opal, it didn’t feel hot to you. And that’s one of the signs. And you didn’t hear the buzzing. Then you take me. You can travel, Auntie. Take me with you, and then you can return here. I’m sorry. It’s impossible. Ian, is this something to do with why you left the Mohawk? You want to go back in time because... Ye say I can’t go. What difference does it make? Seems the time has come for me now to return to England. To Helwater. Helwater? It’s been a while since I heard that name. There’s some news, I’m afraid. Lord Dunsany has died. I must return to make arrangements for the care of the estate, which is now William’s, and the care of Lady Dunsany. She has no one else. Will you send her my condolences, John, if you think she will value them? I know she would. And I shall tell her when I return. But having never expected to be here in the first place, I’m finding it surprisingly difficult to leave. Mt. Josiah has been an escape of sorts from the outside world and its complications. I rather enjoyed working the land. Good to get dirt under your fingernails. Yeah, no doubt you’ll miss it. No doubt there are a great many things I shall miss about being here. But William is the ninth earl of Ellesmere, and when he attains his majority, he’ll be entirely responsible for his estates. He must learn how to be an earl. And it is my duty to prepare him for it. Do ye think you’ll return to Virginia? Eventually? I believe, in time, we will. I can’t imagine William never seeing you again. But it is evident that the mood in the American colonies grows darker by the day. I hope I’m wrong, but... I feel a storm coming. I dinna think you’re wrong. I brought something for you. Such a handsome lad. The older he gets, the more he looks like his father. I’ve asked Brianna to draw some portraits for us. Of all of them, especially Jemmy. Something to remember them by. That’s a braw notion, Sassenach. I remembered you for 20 years, mo chridhe. No pictures at all. But it does help. Claire? Skin’s salty. Ye been crying, lass? No. It’s just so hot, I’ve been sweating. I must smell like the White Sow. Let me see. ‐ ‐ Onions. Garlic. Something hot. - ‐ Peppercorns, aye. - ‐ Cloves. Something woody. Toadstools. That’s not fair. You know exactly what we had for dinner. Vinegar, dill, and pickling cucumbers again. It’s good. I like those. Eau de femme. Ma petite fleur. Let me see. ‐ Gunpowder. ‐ ‐ Hay. And... the faintest whiff of manure. ‐ ‐ It’s very manly. Your special perfume. Ye wanted me, and I fell asleep without touching ye. I’m sorry, Sassenach. It’s all right. You were tired. You could have raised me from the dead for this. What on earth are you doing? Parfum d’amour. Trust me, mo graidh. What are you doing, Sassenach? I’m checking the resolution on this new lens Lord John brought me. Here, have a look. I see ’em. ‐ Wee things with tails, all swimming about. ‐ Aren’t they marvelous? ‐. Aye, marvelous. Busy wee strivers, pushing and writhing. So many of them. You know, when you told me about germs, I thought they’d have wee teeth, but these don’t. Never ken they’d have such handsomely thrashing tails. Well, these particular little beasts aren’t germs. They’re sperms. What’s that? Male reproductive cells. The thing that makes babies. ‐ You mean seed? ‐ ‐ Well, whose are they? They’re yours, of course. Who else’s would they be? Well‐‐how did you get them? I woke up in custody of them this morning. You know they can live for up to one week when they are released into the proper habitat. I, was coming to see you. Who’s this? It’s your brother. I... told you I was a prisoner of war. And I worked as a groom on an English estate called Helwater. Well, that’s where he was born. His name is William, and, aye, your, ‐‐ your mother kens all about him. And who is his mother? If you don’t mind telling me, I mean. Aye, I do, but... I’ll tell you anyway. She was a... a daughter of the estate. Her name was Geneva Dunsany. And it wasn’t a matter of love between us, but it was her choice, and that’s all I’ll say about it. He looks like you. Aye. And very much like you. Where is he now? I mean, can I see him? No, he’s in London. He does not ken I’m his father, and he never will. He is the ninth earl of Ellesmere. If the truth were ever found out, his life would be ruined. The eighth earl of Ellesmere, who’s the‐ the man who supposedly sired him, died when William was born. As did his mother. So old Lord John married her sister, and they became Willy’s parents. So that’s the son Lord John has told me about. ‐ Aye. ‐ Wow. Right, well, Lord John has been a father to William since the lad was six years old. I don’t know what to say. ‐ A brother. ‐ Aye. Aye, I wanted you to ken there was more of your blood in the world than me and your mother. Maybe you could look for him. In books, I mean. He’d be an earl. Might be easy to find. Yeah, I will. When will you leave? We leave in a week. After your mother left me wi’ you in her belly... I never thought I’d see you. But I kent you were there. I was a husband and a father, and now I’m a grandsire. And even though I may never see any of you again... you have made my life whole. Leaving? Roger’s been offered a teaching position. Up north in Boston. Boston? That’s so far away. What are your parents gonna do without you? What am I gonna do without you with another bairn comin’? You’ve become like a sister to me. I know. Leaving everyone is going to be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Aye. We’ll miss you both. Come here. Me either. I know. I’m gonna miss you. - I know, I’m sorry. - Be good. ‐ Miss you. ‐ Bye. I suppose I should start saying my good‐byes to everyone as well while they’re all gathered. I’ll miss them and their wee puddin’ faces. Dinna ken how I’ll bear it. Germain has been a wee angel of late. Joanie too. Bless them. Lizzie‐‐ Of course I’m looking forward to it. Although it will be colder in Boston, will it not? Lizzie. We can’t take you with us. You’ll send for me in a few weeks then. No. You’ll have to stay here at Fraser’s Ridge. Why? I was with you in your darkest time, when that beast attacked you and‐‐ and the good times as well, on your wedding day and when Jemmy was born. You’re the one that saved me. I’m meant to be with you, always. Lizzie, you have always been there for me, and I am so grateful. But I need someone to stay here and look out for my parents for me. They need someone like you to take care of them. Of course, I will if that’s what you wish. Lizzie, please‐‐ please, don’t cry. I am really trying to be brave. You are brave. You’re one of the bravest I know. I’ll never forget you. I’ll never forget you either. Fraser! Mr. Brown. My brother sent me to tell you, the Committee of Safety are gathering in a week. He wants an answer. Are you and your men with us? Tell your brother I’ve considered. With respect, I have to decline his invitation. I’ve spent the last year serving the crown. It’s time to serve my family. I wish ye the best of luck, Mr. Brown. Richard will not be best pleased to hear that, Mr. Fraser. I’m sorry. It’s my final word. I, ‐‐ my wife‐‐I brought my wife to see Mistress Fraser. She’s, in need of a healer. Of course. She’s in her surgery. Please. How long have you two been married? Almost a year now. Your wrist is broken. Now how did this happen? These kind of injuries usually happen with a fall, or if the wrist has been twisted. Just mend it, like you mended me. Marsali, can you get me the splints and some strips of bandage and the balm of Gilead? I’m going to wrap the wrist so the bone can’t move. Now, you have to try not to use your arm too much. Lionel, could you ask my husband for some whiskey? I need to make a tonic for your wife. For the pain. Don’t know how I’ll chop wood and do the washing with one hand. My husband expects the chores to be done. Well, maybe your husband could help you with the chores. Does he get very angry if they’re not done? Of course. What husband wouldn’t? I have seen your husband’s anger. Be quite frightening. He hasn’t been himself since his Alicia’s gone off. He gets sad and he drinks. He wants another babe to raise. And do you? Do you want children, Rose? That’s my duty, isn’t it? He’s a good man. A good man wouldn’t hurt you. It was my own fault, you see, because I wouldn’t‐‐ I wouldn’t lie with him. I don’t mind what he does to me, but if he was cruel to a babe... Dr. Rawlings says that if you don’t lie with a man two weeks before your courses, then you won’t come to be with child. Said so in the newspaper. My mother taught me to read. Everything well in here? Very well indeed. Mistress Fraser’s almost finished. ‐ All right, come on. I’m obliged to you. You needn’t bother with your tonic. ‐ ‐ You take care, Rose. I want to, ‐‐ well, Brianna and I want to ask a favor of you. Aye. Of course. Whatever it is. Will ye come with us? To the stone circle, I mean. Someone will need to bring the wagon and horses home, and we‐‐we don’t want Jamie and Claire to do it. Why not? Brianna’s afraid that if her parents are there she might not find the courage to leave them. I’ll come with you. Thank you. I want you to have this. For everything that you’ve done to help us. Can’t except your land. Then look after it for me. And do with it what you will. I hope you find happiness. Your father tells me you and Roger are going to Boston. Yes. And I’ve just learned something that’s gonna make it even harder to leave. I have a brother. Yeah. So he’s told you. I’m glad. He’s very much like you. And both of you are very much like your father. Both in appearance and disposition. So William has a temper too then? Yes. Yes, he does. He possesses your kindness and courage. Jamie’s as well. I can never tell him about you. Though I wish I could. But... I know. ‐ ‐ My father explained. Well, life is long. Perhaps someday. Perhaps. I’ll be leaving myself in two days’ time. With my new manservant. ‐ Your manservant. ‐ Ulysses. Taking him to England with you? He can travel safely in the guise of my servant. When he sets foot on a British ship, he’ll be a free man. That’s a good idea. Your father thought of it. He reminded me that I might need someone to play chess with on the long voyage to London. I have heard that you’re quite the master at chess. And a wonderful father. My brother’s lucky to have you in his life. And so am I. You really are impossible not to like. I never had grandparents. Neither did I. Not even parents to begin with. Mama. Now, I thought before dinner, we could have the future’s answer to journey cake, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Very tasty, but... are you sure it’s to be eaten? Ye could seal letters or mend your boots wi’ it as well. To home. To family. Great health. Slàinte mhath. ‐ Slàinte mhath. Slàinte mhath. Up here, Dad. Are we going for a walk? Mommy,. Thought I might find you here. It’s only been two weeks. Feels like they’ve been gone for an eternity. Yeah. And if Roger was right, they should be reaching the stone circle right about now. We started our life on the Ridge in this cabin. And now it’s just you and me again. We’re not alone, Sassenach. She’s so talented. Aye. Maybe in the future she can finally be an engineer. Are ye ready? ‐ ‐ - ‐ As we’ll ever be. - ‐ Each strand of this rope is delicate and fragile. But braided together, it’s strong, and it’ll hold us. Let’s hope so. Ian. Thank you for everything you’ve done for us. Take care of my parents. I love you. I love you too, cousin. Ooh. Here. Jem, baby, take that one. Hold it tight, okay? ‐ I will. ‐ Hold it tight. ‐ I’m holding it tight. ‐ Yeah, good boy. I’m okay! Are you all right? I just feel like I’ve been turned inside out. ‐ Mommy. ‐ Jem. ‐ ‐ We made it. Aye. What the devil? What do you think? What a privilege to help with such a task. Aye. You may laugh, but there’s an art to it. Voltaire says the perfect is the enemy of the good. I’m sure Voltaire never dug a privy in his life. Fire? The still. What was that? ‐ The still. Well, I’m coming with you. No, no, no, you have patients to attend to. We’ll see to them. The trick is to get the humerus bone, which is the upper arm bone, ‐ into the right angle... ‐ So that when you apply force, the head of the bone will‐‐ Back into the shoulder joint. Aye, sort of like the opposite of what you do when ya joint a hog. Yes, well, in that case you’re cutting everything apart. Here, we’re putting it back together. Well, thank God for small mercies? ‐ ‐ What on earth? What’s the meaning of this? No! Hide, stay there no matter what happens. No! Get off of me! Let her go, you bastards‐‐ Get outta here! Let go of me! - Marsali! - ‐ No! ‐ ‐ No! Jamie! No! Jamie! Germain. It’s nearly dark. What‐what are you doing? What are you doing out here by yourself, p’tit garçon? ‐ Where’s Mama? ‐ Mama won’t wake up, Papa. Where’s your grannie? The bad men took Grandmama. Sh‐she’s breathing. Claire? Claire? Claire?
