But, you know, if, uh... You get involved in something that was... Anti-sociable. duke, what’s the term i’m looking for? Ah... Immoral? Exactly. immoral. So, uh...

Eric: listen, thank you very much for taking the time to come out here. Ms. park: i appreciate your call. So, understand i can’t leave you with any of these materials just yet And i’m speaking for background only. Okay, i understand. let’s see. Here we have the original, this is the ’97 estimates... Sean: yeah, it was that chinese chick from the 11:00 news. - Duke: you sure it was her? - yeah, positive. gatley had this file. Sean: he was showing her stuff. papers and shit. Duke: jesus. jesus fucking christ. All right, i’ll tell matthews. You stay on the job, okay? it’s more important now than ever. - Hey sean, you didn’t do so bad, huh? - thank you. Yeah, you may not be a professional, but you did a nice job. Hey, crawley, Nice fucking neighborhood you live in. You know how long i’ve been fucking sitting here waiting for you? About that long. ( laughs ) Don’t fucking stare at me, get in. You know you-- You’ve been really good for me, crawley. Well, i get the job done. Let me tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was this girl-- samantha. She was, uh-- She was my secretary. She was 18 years old. She looked like she was 13, you know what i mean? ( Laughs ) yeah. I was, uh-- I was head over heels in love with this girl. I mean stupid, you know? Like some teenage pussy. ( Laughs ) I’d a done anything for this girl. But it wasn’t-- it really wasn’t all that easy. I mean, samantha lived with her family and-- And i was-- fuck, i was married. Anyway, i had this guy i worked with, He had an apartment that was close by the office. So i worked something out with him where he would give me the keys, He’d disappear for a little while and i could Go up there with samantha. The first time i ever take her up there-- And i tell you what, i wanted this pussy bad-- We get in there and the guy’s got a little fucking dog. Right away, she grabs the dog, And i’m going, "samantha, leave the dog. let’s go back here." I get her in the fucking bedroom. Things are, you know, they’re leaning towards, Where i wanna go, you know? Suddenly the dog starts scratchin’ at the door. ( Whimpering ) She’s looking at the door and she’s laughing, you know? Paying more attention to the fucking dog than me. "sam, sam, excuse me a minute." I walk out the door and i boot this fucking dog right across the room, Like a fucking field goal. It shuts him right up, i get in the fucking room, And the next thing you know, i got the blouse is coming open and it’s all good. And i know that fucking clam is shaved. You know what i mean? i gotta see it. And the fucking dog starts scratching at the door again, Yelping-- and now she’s looking at the fucking door and she’s losing-- She’s losing her concentration. she isn’t in the fucking moment anymore. "Excuse me, sam." i walk out the fucking door And i grab the fucking dog, And i snap it’s fucking neck like a twig. I take the fucking little cocksucker and i throw him down the laundry shoot. And i go back in the room... It turns out little ol’ sammy fucks like a bunny. ( Chuckles ) There’s a point to the story, crawl. Sometimes you gotta be a little bit ruthless. Something gets in your way, you eliminate it. You know what i mean? So the question really is... How far are you willing to go, crawl? ( Dog barking ) To get rid of a barking dog? Well, i mean... ( Clears throat ) The conditions would have to be right. What would these conditions be? Okay, um... Well, one-- there would have to be No possible way of my getting caught or even suspected. That’s a given. Right. And then, i’d have to be sure i was physically safe. You know, i wouldn’t want to put myself in danger from The victim or anyone else who might be around, so i-- I’d have to be in a guaranteed superior position. You mean stronger? Yeah, i mean one way or another, with better weapons or surprise or whatever. Makes sense. Okay. four-- Whoa, what happened to three? - We just did three. - what was it? It doesn’t matter. fine, this is three then. Which is-- it’s actually part of two. Anyway, it’s-- I’d have to be 100% sure that i could pull it off. - You shoot the fucking guy. - no, no, no. you see, i can’t-- That doesn’t-- that comes back to the point-- to number-- The point about safety. where it can’t be a weapon that could ever be traced. - That’s-- that’s good thinking. - yeah. Okay... what number are we at? Who the fuck knows? you lost me back at three! You know what? it doesn’t matter. Five then, point five-- A reason. I’d need a reason why i was gonna do it. Such as? Such as a... reward. Reward? Yeah, you know... If there was a big enough reward for doing it. How’s five grand sound? Sounds like nothing. 15 has a better ring to it. 10. 13. How’s 13 grand sound? That’s my lucky number. I’m sorry. ( Doorbell rings ) Don’t answer the door. Don’t answer the door, you fucker. Don’t be stupid all your life. Hi, mr. gatley. Is susan home? No, she took our daughter to ballet. Oh, shoot, i thought she’d be here on a saturday. Yeah, no, i’m sorry. - I’m from the midnight mission. can i leave a message? - oh. Sure. I don’t have a pen and paper. Uh... oh, Yeah, hang on, sorry. i’m in the garden, i’ll just... Thank you. Eric: okay, let’s see... This place is such a mess. ( Rustling ) Oh. Yeah, you know what? that’s actually kind of somewhat valuable. I’d rather that you didn’t handle that. thank you. What are you doing? ( Mumbling ) Shh. just be quiet, man. Don’t worry. Just lie down. Just lie down. Where’s your hat? Go to sleep. ( Mumbling continues ) Bye, mr. gatley. I’ll call later this week. ( Honking ) Fucking asshole! I’m sorry! ( Crashing ) Sean: come on, duke. Come on, you fat fuck! answer the phone! Answer the fucking phone! Ms. park: eric gatley’s wife, susan, has no idea Why her husband was murdered. Police have no new leads in the case, but... I could reveal exclusively that i spoke To the murdered city hall accountant just days before he was killed. Eric gatley had been investigating corruption in city hall... Shit, guy wears a hat like that deserves to die. ...He had been looking into the activities of this man, Local building contractor, ray matthews. It’s your shot. sean, it’s your turn. - ...The work of a professional hit man d - yeah... ...Made to look like a casual robbery gone wrong. I’m sorry, i gotta go, george. What? We’re in the middle of a game here-- sean! ( Phone ringing ) - Hello. - duke: sean. Duke! oh, for christ’s sakes! - Look, where-- - shut up and listen! Tomorrow morning. the zoo. first thing. You got some talking to do. Me?! i’ve got some talking to do?! - ( Dial tone ) - duke! duke! ( Trolley bell ringing ) ( Animal moaning ) What’s going on here, duke? what are we doing at the zoo? You know anybody that ever goes to the zoo? - No. - no, well, me neither. This way no one will recognize us. Besides... I kinda like it. it’s nice. - So you got my money? - what fucking money? - Matthews owes me. - oh, fuck. Come on, will ya? Sean, you know what people do when the go to the zoo? What? They try to figure out what animals their friends look like. Duke. duke! You never played this game before? Of course, usually, it’s monkeys, i’ll grant you that, but i think we can do better. - Duke-- - and no fair are the obvious stuff, Like calling me a fucking elephant or a warthog or something. You gotta use the imagination. As for you... Clearly we have to go to the reptile house. Duke! Duke: yeah, there’s a bit of a lizard about you, you know? A little bit slimy, Watchful, waiting. - A little bit of camouflage. - quit fucking around, duke! ( Laughing ) - What’s so fucking funny? - you are! you’re fucking hilarious. You come on the big tough detective. You think you got it all figured out, But you’re fucking pitiful. why do you think we hired you in the first place? I don’t know, because if anything happened i can’t be connected to you. Yeah, and...? And i guess, because you thought i’d be good at it. You? what good are you at following people? Figuring things out? You’re a clueless little turd who’s about a good a detective As i am a fucking ballerina. You don’t even have a car, for christ’s sakes! No, you’re useless. that’s why we hired you, because you’re useless. Why? fuck it, duke, why? We wanted to rattle the guy, shake him up. He’d had his dick out for so long we wanted to know If he was going to fuck or fuck up. So, i think of you. you’ll follow the guy. He’s gonna see you, maybe get all shook up, Freak out. then he makes a move and we haven’t touched him. And then you go and kill the guy? - That was your plan. - oh, no, that was never my plan. That was ray’s brilliant idea. Fucking ray. Duke: the only way for you to be completely safe is to disappear. Sean: i did a job and i want to be paid. Why would anybody give you 13 grand to do anything? But i did it, and i want my money, And i’m not leaving town until i get it. And if i have to make it difficult for you, i-- ( Choking ) You’re nothing. you’re a worthless piece of shit Who got involved in something you should have left alone. You don’t tell me to do anything! All right, you’re gonna get no more money, And you will disappear, you understand? I don’t want to ever see you again. And if i do... I’ll can kill you. I can kill you and i wouldn’t even break into a sweat. I could just crush you and then it would be over. Like you said, nothing could tie us to you. So go away now. go. ( Coughing ) Oh, look. i think i found you. Yeah, there you are. Look, sean. look, look, i found you. I found you, right there! You’re an insect. a fucking ant. Look, that one there-- he looks just like you. - Thank you. - mm-hmm. ( Dogs barking ) Hey. You okay? you sounded pretty pissed off on the phone. Yeah, i know. Well, what’s up? You know those guys i told you about? Yeah, the ones who won’t pay you? Yeah, well... It’s getting pretty scary, actually. They’re trying to frighten me off, make me leave town. If i were you, i’d just do what they say. They owe me, george. Yeah, but these guys get pretty serious. I’d just do what they want, get out of town. You know, there’s nothing keeping you here. No, i’m not leaving. I need you to do something for me. What? I need you to keep this for me. - I don’t think so-- - it’s just contracts and shit. It’s just proof i did the work. just keep it till i figure out what i’m going to do. - I don’t know, man. - george, they don’t know you. All right? keep it safe. - Sean. - shit. Where did you go? hey! Get back here! hey, come on now! What are you-- don’t make me run after you! Sorry, george. Come on, now. Wow! Ow! Shit! - He’s clean. - carl, let’s go. Sean: what the fuck, duke? what do you want? Duke: i told you, i want you to fuck off. why are you still here? All right, look, i got something for you. - What’s that? - train ticket to chicago. There is a guy who’s gonna meet you at the station, all right? - He’ll have your money. - chicago?! - We want you outta here. - how do i know the guy’ll be there? - How can i trust you? - you don’t have a choice. ( Train horn blaring ) So long. - I’ve got his file, duke. - huh? Gatley’s file. all the evidence he was compiling against matthews. I’ve got it. Yeah, it’s evidence of a different kind now. Some personal notes of my own in it. In fact, i think you’re name is mentioned once or twice. What are you saying? Come on, duke. you’ve seen enough movies, you know the line. Anything happens to me and that file shows up. Where’s the file, sean? Let’s forget about this whole chicago thing, huh? what do you say? We both know there’s no guy in chicago. Take me back to town. - ( Laughing ) - stay down! - Carl: what’s up? uh? - give me the fucking phone. Kid’s got a file on gatley. I want you to tell matthews-- Tell him to send someone around to his apartment, all right? Search the place. Where is the file, sean? What if i don’t tell you? What are you gonna do, kill me? i don’t think so. - ( Clangs ) - oh! So... You’re just gonna beat me up, huh? Where is the file? My lips are sealed. So, if you’re gonna beat me up later, you might as well beat me up now. - Yeah, you’d like that, huh? - come on, do it. Do it now, it’s all the same to me. You don’t care if i beat you up, huh? I’ll still be alive, So it doesn’t scare me. Shit, you could spend the rest of the year just beating the shit out of me, And at the end of it, i’ll still be alive, And you still wouldn’t know where the file is. So you see, unless you’re gonna kill me... I can deal with it. How about i cut your balls off? Well, i’m sure a person can get used to it. You would know. - What did he say? - he wants us to go to his place out in the desert. - The fucking ranch? - hey, that’s what he said. - Oh, fuck that. - if that’s what the man says... Carl, put on some music. It’s gonna be a long fucking day. - ♪ What’s up? ♪ his - ♪ to the hot boys that party where you’re at ♪ ♪ What’s up? ♪ - ♪ What’s up? ♪ s - ♪ on the dance floor making you bounce ♪ ♪ Drinking bud and 40’s while i buy ’em by the ounce ♪ - ♪ What’s up? ♪ e floor - ♪ if you’re freaky... ♪ Duke: all right.

Yeah, that’s right. Tie him up. Duke here is very proficient with knots. aren’t you, duke? Used to be in the boy scouts, mr. matthews. Ow. Where’s the file, sean? Come on, you know i’m not going to tell you. You know what i’d like, sean? i’d like for you to vanish. Vanish off the face of the earth, that’s what i’d like. But you hired me. i did exactly what you told me to do. What are you talking about, i was drunk. ( All laugh ) You shouldn’t listen to me. - This is crazy. - yeah, tell me about it. See, i got a problem here. i’m in a lot of shit. cops are getting real close to me. Well, i’m the last person who’s gonna go to the cops. can’t you see that? Sooner or later the cops are going to come to you. Okay? but without you around, They can’t prove a thing. Don’t you think killing me is gonna make things a little more complicated?

See you, my friend, are the only killer in this room. my hands are clean. And i would like to keep it that way.

( Coughing ) You gotta be careful with whiskey, crawley. Deadens the pain, but fucks the brain. See, what i really need you to do is disappear. You know, poof, gone, nobody, nothin’. Then i had an idea. You really don’t need to kill a guy to make him disappear, right? ( Screaming ) Let me tell you a little story. There was a guy who used to work for me, dino scarbor. - Remember dino, duke? - yeah, poor bastard. Now, listen. great guy, good looking, sharp dresser. Could kill the ladies, i mean, just a joy to have around. Yeah, could talk the panties off a nun, couldn’t he? ( All laugh ) So i got dino on this construction site, we’re working together. A crane with a big, big block of cement comes over And whacks dino right in the side of the head. Didn’t kill him, trust me he wished it had. - We don’t call him dino no more. - we call him dumbo. - ( Laughs ) - guy’s a vegetable, can’t understand a word he’s saying. Believe me, i don’t think he can understand most of it. He just sits there staring at the wall. ( Mumbling ) It’s pitiful. drooling all over himself. You know it’s really, really, scary What a single blow to the head can do. Really scary. You know, it feels like about a three wood. I think i got the wrong club. Come on, matthews. you’re not serious, are you? You know... Maybe you hid the file someplace, maybe you didn’t. The way i figure it, i can make you forget where you put it. I can make you forget everything. - The stupidest thing i ever heard. - come on, crawley. Who’s gonna pay any attention to a shuffling Juiced up head case like yourself, huh? You can’t just make somebody a vegetable, you can’t. Oh, no? - Tell that to dumbo. - ( all laugh ) Hey, carl. don’t want to leave any marks, So cut off a piece of that mattress, wrap it around his head. Matthews... Ray: sean crawley on the outside. Dumbo dino on the inside. It’s gonna be fun. No. ( Grunts ) Let’s go. Alrighty, i’m figuring right about there. You ready, crawl? ho-ho! Okay. ( Bones crack ) Step back, boys. You ready?

I hardly recognize you from the guy we brought in three of four weeks ago. Couldn’t have done it without you. Well, it’s been really good for me too, Being given the chance to... - ( Sean grunts ) - james, you all right? No, i’m fine. i just-- Just the mother of all headaches. it’s okay. It’s all right. it’ll go away. Like pain always does. So, james... You can’t stay in the shelter for much longer. It’s really only meant for temporary accommodation. We need the bed. So, do you have somewhere to go Or will you just go back on the streets? No, no, i have somewhere to go. Come on, you can’t stay here. ( Police siren blares ) ...It’s just that you don’t know anything about him.

It’s not healthy. I don’t know what i’m saying. it’s just... Being in this room, Where it all-- There’s just lots of things to remind me. You got a new fridge. What? I mean, that can’t be the one.

The ants will keep on doing what they do And we just keep on doing what we do. In a few minutes you’ll be dead. And there’s nothing any of us can do about that. I never did anything wrong. It doesn’t work like that, becket. ( Heavy breathing ) Please, i never beat you. I looked after you, please. Nothing matters anymore, becket, ’Cause you’re dead. You-- you’re going to kill us then?
