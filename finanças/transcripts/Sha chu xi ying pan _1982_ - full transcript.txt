Mr. Choi I came to ask you some question I have left your gang for many years. Never asked the resentment. But I received an order. That wanted me to kill you. Why? Mr. Choi, someone wanted to make fun I refused that order one hour. Suddenly my men were killed. Then they're making fun with you I think there's internal conflict in Wa-Hing I didn't listen to him. He tried to kill me. You're still alive. Ko, we're Wa-Hing bosses. Why didn't date us? Don't spread rumor behind us. Let's play snooker tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll jog. How about tonight. Gor, don't you fear to lose again? Don't mention last time I haven't practiced for 2 weeks. We'll see later. Hor, how about your new boat. There's something, don't forget us. You killed our client Mr. Pan. We still have to play snooker. This time ifs for Gods face. Next time you won't get easily. What have Ko got to do with you? He was my customer. What kind of customer? Fortunate? Massage? Or patroness... Well, what kind? Don't stimulate the old lady. Why does Go deposit money to your account? Is that illegal? Where are the receipt?

His place was ruined. Could he be killed by murderers. “Disappeared“ settles this? What've you done for weeks? What are you doing? I've some news. Ko's got a shipping firm. Has been in the business for five years. The four passport hasn't been used. He hasn't left Hong kong a few years. What did he kill people? That's his secret I have investigated him 10 years ago. But nothing can be got. And he's also a righteous man. Don't care he is righteous man. You're not his lawyer. Jap Interpol want to do Pan's case. They said H.K.overseas killer committed. What's your opinion? Probably Ko's men killed Mr. Pun 4 men were killed that night I think those 4 men were Ko's men. Any evidence? Those 4 bodies are almost with callus here. They were all coolies. It's different. Look at here. What are you doing? Sorry... The experts said the body shaped callus here. It is because using gun often. The test results tell that. There were dynamite in the nail. Then who hired Ko? How did Ko get the order? This... Something wrong, you'd be responsible. Someone saw Ko came here that night. That's right. What did he say to you? I told him his fortunate. Did you massage him? Your job like those days in the massage room. Enough. Can I leave? They said you're his mistress. You can leave. Your man's waiting in the hotel. Stop. Stop. Please... Sorry... Tell the truth, don't act like... I fell so good today, if... What happen. What're you trying to said? Ko... Say... Ko..Da... Fu... What're you trying to said? Ko... Da... Fu... Ko Da-Fu what? Hey, Wait-' - Stop. Well, not satisfied. What is it? Nothing"- You bastard. A female suspect was brought to police station for investigation. She tried to commit suicide.

Yes, Sir. Has Mr. Ko come back? I told you last night. Why did he suddenly come back? He can come back home any times. Hope he's alright. He used to come back once per year. But this is the 2nd time.

Go to find them for any information I come to visit friend, not on duty. Mr. Hor needs rest. Let him in. Mr. Hor I am responsible for this case I want to know if Ko did it.

No. Where is he? It's hot. Will you say or not? Okay. I'll tell you. He has gone back to Sal Ying Peon. What's the address? I don't know. Here is your soup. Maybe Mr. Ko ran into the trouble. What shall we do? Don't ask. Be a good woman. Push harder. Almost. Push. Okay. Push. Push. No bad. Let me do it. Young people play everything. They fear nothing. Why don't you talk to me? Your name is Ton Ke Yee I remembered you're Yee 5 seconds. Come here for dinner with me. Where the letters will be sent to? To the police 2 dollars. Thank you. Your umbrella. May I help you? I'm so glad. You take my umbrella for me I like to be with you. Do you know cooking? I can only make the soup. You make the soup, I do the other. Who are you? You don't know me I investigated you 10 years ago. Go away. Listen to me first. Kum called your name before her dying. Come in I had no evidence to arrest you. You haven't now. Just like 10 years ago. In Tokyo, Amsterdam San Francisco's lnterpolice. They think these cases are committed by H.K. killer I received Tokyo's telephone. They thought those H.K.killer were more popular than Garments, toys. Those Japs are very upset. Do you related to the death of the man Pan? Of course you didn't do it in the scene. Did your men do that? In this picture, one of them betrayed you. They're my friends. Did you betray your friends? The dead bodies were found in the scene. Their features were ruined. They tried to cover their identity I think you know why. Your 4 friends all dead? You have no evidence. Go. If I found out who tried to conspire you. Shall you go to the police? You want to arrest me and Wa-hing's men. Then you'll be great. It is satisfactory feeling. Well, what do you said? This is my business I am sorry about Kum's dead. She called your name before dying. People like us shouldn't have girlfriend. You brought him here? Yee, go back to your room. Gasoline? Uncle I trust you. What are you doing? Fuck you. Catch it. Ko Do-Fu... You're not trustworthy. Ko Do-Fu, I thought you're shit I don't let you get away next time. Move. Ko Da-Fu... Ko Da-Fu, don't move I starting my eliminating. You're an expert. Mr. Chung came. Mr. Ting, Mr. Choi, sorry for late. Sorry. Your partners were shoot. What do you have in mind? You should know better than us I don't think Ko Da-Fu do it I don't know Ko Da-Fu. No reason you don't know Ko Da-Fu. He met you last month 20th I am sure you remember I'm not interested I did not carry recorder with bug. Let's be honest. Talk to my lawyer I'm trying to help you. You're not leaving? I'll talk to your boss. Hor, you should rest more you are hoping I'll rest forever. How can you say this? I planned not to say. Mr Chung is here, I feel safe I only want to know who make trouble. How can you suspect your men? Anybody shouldn't suspect if I dead I saw the gunner wasn't Ko Da-Fu. It's a set up. You inviting me and Gor to look for Ko is a trick. You forget Gou invited us. Gou has already been killed I want to know who did it I don't force anyone to be cooperated. Just tell me and I'll give up. Who made this set? There is one thing we'll be interested in I received a telegram from Japan Police. They said Pan's heir has been friends with a H.K. big wig. It means the business in South East Asia is wholly being controlled by the big wig. That boss is right here. Look at it, whoever is in here. You don't need to see it. It's me. Don't go, our boss asks you staying here. This your elimination action? Did you hire Ko to kill Pan? I hired Ko to kill Choi and me. So no one would suspect me. You knew Ko wouldn't accept this deal. And you killed Ko's 4 brother. You let Ko to kill your partner. You're an expert, but it can't work me I didn't get any telegram. Next time I'll get you I am glad you're so honest I'll talk to Ko about my next action. Who's Kum? A woman. She called your name before dying. She must be very heart broken. So bad I couldn't drink your soup. At 1:00 am in Sai Yin Poon waterfront I will tell you a story. Well, how there going on? Nothing, haven't seen that guy. Must be careful. So cold. It's so silent here. Look. He is sending the refreshment. Have some refreshment. Quiet good. Ding. Ding! Get out. Over there. You watch here. Hold on. Hold on. Over there. No one answer it? Ho, Zai-Kong, over. Ho, Zai-Kong, over. Try again. Ho, Zai-Kong, over... No one reads me. Boss, we lost our contact. Okay, we've got enough men. What are you doing here? I... Don't move. Get lost. Ding, dogs are useless. You really have gun. How many bullets do you have? You shoot, they'll shoot you. Shut up. Have you decided? You've got nothing to say, shoot. Wor only hid his gun under table. But you hid yours in your heart. You didn't ask why I did like this I should've figured that is you. You didn't die in the accident. You are out date. Opportunity is hard to get. Really? You lost the game. No, Siu, I didn't. You should not shoot at my hand. You should've shot at my heart
