Saturday, 10:50 a.m. Good morning. I didn't know what he was going though, that Saturday morning. Get up, we're going home. If only I had a clue... Did you sleep well? ...everything could have been different. How was the disco last night? It was great. We ruled the floor. Okay. Come on, up. Gili, a word with you. If I had known about the tape he put in my bag, if I had known what was on it. Wow, look at the view. -How did you sleep? -Great. I wouldn't have let him leave like that. Don't wait for me. I'll meet you in Tel-Aviv. What's up? -I've got some things to do. Call me when you get back? We'll go for a drink. I keep watching the last video, over and over again, trying to understand what he went through. The last meal, ladies and gentlemen, the last coffee. Awesome food, we had here. I'm going back home. I'm going to ask my parents to... Oops, I spilled the coffee... But he was good at hiding his feelings, even on video. But this story should be told from the beginning... starting a few years back. I'm so excited! Yesterday I saw the most amazing thing. Tel-Aviv. Three years before. She looked at me as though I was air. Her gaze went right through me. I was shocked! I'm sure she thinks I'm a moron, who's scared of his own shadow. I know I'm going to dedicate weeks and months just to try to get near her. I must get close to her. She lives in my building! It's like, what I see on MTV, all I ever wanted... Here in my building! "The woman in dreams "that won't come true without you. "Looking for a place "To stop thinking about you. "If you're going away, take me with you. "Do you hear? It's me. "Singing to you. "If you're going away, take me with you. "Do you hear? It's me. "Singing to you. "Who told you there's no choice?" It was after one of our endless running contests, in which, of course, I always won, that Gili told me about Tal. It's true, I did advise him what to do. Gili, where are you going? He just rushed out the door. So? When are you coming? "If you're going away, take me with you. "Do you hear? It's me. "Singing to you." Do you know them? They're great! By the way, I'm Gili. You live here? -Yes. You didn't tell me your name. -Tal. I'm on the 8th floor. And you? -7th. We can talk to each other from the balconies. About what? -Whatever, we'll find something. It's amazing! You also like The Jews (rock band). No one really understands their music? I mean, they're not too popular. How can you explain that? They're ahead of their time, they don't give a damn, they go all the way, without any boundaries. A sure recipe for failure. Yeah... I agree... I heard they made a helluva video clip of this song, and I set the video, to record it and all, but it was the wrong channel and I recorded Bloopers. And nobody has it, I'm crazy about it. I was trying to get it... I think I have it somewhere. Really?! Could I borrow it? I'll return it. -Okay. Great! I heard there's an awesome part where she... Good evening, Gili Hiya. Are you alright? -Yes. Where did you rush off to? -Mom, I love you! I'm going to pack for Eilat. They say there's love in the world. Senior class, what is love? Liz always stole the show at the end of the year play. Funny, huh? Go ahead laugh. Okay, students, stay here, and I'm going to the principal, you'll wait for me like lambs. I spat on you. What happens when two protons meet? An explosion! Liz! Liz! She's great! She's great! One, Two, Three, Four. Sleeping on the shore and more. "When will you see with your own eyes. "Touch with your own hands, know in your thoughts. "That the road to you passes through my heart." He's gaining, he's gaining. Hi, girls. Put the bike in the trunk, come with us, bro! I filmed you. -I'm going with him. Actually we had fun, horsing around. Want to come with me? Yes, I want to feel nature on my flesh. Are you shooting? We got here yesterday. Danny wanted to sleep on the beach. I already fantasized about tents, campfire, blondes... Guess what came out of it? You call this a beach? This is Danny's beach! Do you get it? At night it was freezing, like the north pole. Liz caught a cold, Mili never quit whining... We woke up at dawn and there it was, the real thing! Shachar already had a knack for making deals. May I help? -No, it's okay. He collected all our money, left us broke, just to spend a night at a luxury hotel. Hello. -Hello. Do you have a suite for tonight? -Yes. How many are you? -Just me. The Russian suite is available. 1,100 shekels. No problem. How are you paying? Here you are. Have a pleasant stay. -Thank you. Shachar, sorry we didn't help you. We didn't know if it would be alright. Yes, what did you want? -Shachar, what's wrong? Look at this place. Don't touch the minibar. Where's the balcony? Hey, man, this is... Man, you're great. Look at the view! Danny, get down, please. Shachar, I'm hungry. All we can do is wait for breakfast tomorrow. I'm willing to give up this luxurious suite of yours for a warm baguette with butter. Why does such a little boy need so much food? Who's there? -Room service. Yes? -You ordered lemons. -Yes sir, thank you. Do I have to sign anything? -No. Thanks. Anything else? Thank you, sir. Shachar, I hope this is what you'll eat at your wedding. Good morning. -Good morning. Room number? 1619. I'll just have coffee and then I'll leave. I'll come back to eat later then you'll remember me. Excuse me. -Can't you see you're in the way? I'm going and I'll be back. Good morning. I was here and I'm back to eat. Coffee? Room number? -1619. It's the suite. 1619 was here already. That's what I'm saying. It's me. I'm back. You keep asking me. Hello, are you with me? It's me, from the suite. -What do you want now? To eat, if I may. May I? Why aren't you eating? How long will it take? Shachar's waiting for the shirt. An hour and a half and I'm all set. Take it off. I'll take it to him. He must be dying. No! Like I said, Shachar was the king of deals. It's labelled "Clips". Which cassette exactly? Try this one first. I heard that your river is nice, and that lovely animals come to drink its water. Is that you in the? -No... not here. Try the other one. It's not here either. That's not it. Give me the remote. Wow! That's... What is that picture? -What does it look like? It looks like an accident. -You're not very far off. I wanted you to wish me good luck for something. I have the feeling that you'll bring me luck. Good luck. -I have this driving test tomorrow... Test? You don't have a license? I might have one tomorrow, and if I do, I'll take my dad's car for a spin. I was thinking, I thought you might come along with me. I can't. Too bad. I thought you might motivate me to pass. Okay, bye. -Didn't you forget something? How stupid of me. That's what I came for. She's got those eyes, you know those girls... -Come on, play. But I think I screwed up. Like a jerk I told her that I have a test coming up. She made a face. She was shocked that I don't have my license yet. What's the story. You'll have it tomorrow. Yeah. Who says I'll pass? -If Liz did, so will you. I doubt I'll pass. -Want to see that you will? Gili Damti passes the test! Congratulations! No way. -Why not? -The reverse... What about it? -I have a problem with it. What kind of problem? -I can't manage reverse. Your reverse is fine. -No. Just for my peace of mind let's go over it again. I feel uncomfortable. -Know what? Drive. Drive in reverse! You can do it! Hey Mister! Don't you have eyes? You think you own the road? Look, in real time it'll come to you. Gili, listen, it's your moment of truth. You have to show everything you learned. You can do it. Don't worry. You can pass the test! It's just the reverse... Don't worry. The reverse will be okay. You'll see, everything will be fine. I see the tester coming. Man, you're lucky. You got a good tester. Don't worry. You'll pass. You'll pass if you do everything right. No problem. Good luck. I already did my test. Get behind the wheel. Drive! You think you're a hero, driving 90 in the city? Some people should take the bus. Reverse? -I said that some people should take a bus. Sir! This isn't a think tank. You didn't buy this spot. It's for temporary use. You cross and go on. When are you are beginning military service? -Reverse? Military service, when? In two months. -Which unit? -Paratroopers. Stop here. Drive in reverse. "You don't have a license yet?" Gili, how did it go? -Not good. What went wrong? What happened? I did the reverse fine, but everything else stunk. Did he touch the wheel? -No. No? Did he say anything? He asked where I'm being posted in the army. You failed. Are you kidding me? That's great. I have a license? Yeh! Thanks! Bro, you're the best. Yes! Where to, bro? -Nowhere. Did you pass? With flying colors. You wouldn't believe it. I really drove good. The reverse was perfect. The tester guy was in shock. -Man... you did it. What am I saying, people in the street saluted. You wouldn't believe how great it was. You made fun of me. They don't want me. -Who? They're not drafting me. Nonsense, I'll show them. I'll prove what I'm worth. You can appeal. -It won't do any good, Gili. Okay, come on. Forget it. Think about it for a minute. I'll be on the hills, in the gutter and you'll be at parties. What are you talking about? Smile, bro, life is great. Right. How are we going to celebrate your license? Breaking news... You made it. What about respect? I passed the first time. Great. I wasn't sure that I would pass. Because my teacher would insinuate stuff like: He's not sure, he didn't have a good feeling, stuff like that. Am I interrupting? -No. I wanted to ask you... I've been saving this question for years. Ask. There's this white BMW downstairs. I thought I might take it out tonight. So I have to accept that I have a partner? I think it's great. -No problem. Really? You're great. My friends are waiting. They want to see me driving for the first time. When can I have it? -Any time you want. Just let me know half a hour in advance, so I can get ready. I didn't... understand. -Understand what? Get ready for what? -We'll drive together, no? Why do you want to come with me? It's your first time on the road. I want to come. Don't you trust me? -Gili, it's not that. I just want to see how you drive. So let me go alone. -Sit, sit for a minute. Look, Gili. It's not that I don't trust you. But on your first evening on the road I want to be with you. -But I have a date. Okay. I didn't take that into consideration. Fine. So it's settled! Yes. I'll sit in the back. -Are you kidding me? Gili, I can't let you drive alone your first time. Don't you get it? -I don't believe this. I thought that if you gave me the car, I'd be going alone. Now you say you're coming. What was I so happy about? I don't believe this. What don't you believe? -I simply don't. Really. Well start believing or take a taxi. Great. Thanks, Dad. This is just great. Reli, I'm going crazy. Your son got his license today. You know very well what happens on the roads. And you just go on, business as usual. What do you want to do? The proper authorities say that he can drive. Stop it, what does this have to do with authorities? Look, Reli, it's not that I don't trust him. I'm sure that he's a fine driver. But one little mistake is enough... You know what one mistake means on the road. Can you guarantee that you won't make a mistake? Come on, how can you compare? I don't understand it. For giving them guns and serving in the army, they're fine? I never heard you complain about that. In the army commanders watch over them. Who will watch over him on the road? I'm sure you'll forgive me. I brought a joint so... Tal, this is my dad. -Good evening. Is this a PTA meeting? -Not exactly. He needed a ride, so I thought... Which way? -A surprise. Good. "The boy who was put in the corner has grown. "He's grown and remembers every blow, every word "Look at me down there, standing and singing. "Look at me, not happy yet. "This is for you, so now you'll know. "Sending my voice up, so you'll hear..." Go, go, don't stop on green! Gili, pull over. What? -One more stunt like that, and you and your girlfriend are in the back seat, heading strait home. Dad, you're embarrassing me. You're embarrassing me. Drive like a human being. Hear? I don't care who you're with. It's you, you make me nervous. Can't you see? I make you nervous? I'm sitting in the back, not saying a word, while you made five violations. What five violations? What did I do? Gili, you don't drive well. -Dad, do me a favor. Leave me alone. Don't you understand? She'll leave. I don't care. The only thing you care about is not getting your paint job scratched... Don't talk that way to me! I'm sorry, Gili. I didn't mean... Gili, just yesterday, you used a plate as a wheel, and went bam bam... Now you want to fly on the road like... Okay, I'll leave you alone. Just take care. Your friend is gaining! You drive too fast. -Look who's talking. Don't ever try to compete with me. A car can't compete with a motorcycle. Who was competing? I was just driving... Never drive the way other people feel. Drive the way you feel. Otherwise, you'll find yourself splattered on the road. It's strange hearing that from you of all people. Yes, me of all people. Watch the bag for a minute. When I first saw Tal, it was after I heard Gili's stories about her. I admit, her immense love for herself infected me too. Say, where's the guy who was sitting here? What? -The guy with the leather jacket. I have no idea. Giloush, what's up? -I'll be right back. Okay. We'll be downstairs. I was looking for you! -I was looking for you. Thanks... I made a phone call... My girlfriend is back from New York. I haven't seen her in two years. I though I'd visit her if you don't mind. I wanted to say that... You danced really good. Everyone was watching. -Thanks. So... Do you mind if I go? -I can take you. I have a rlde. I had a good time. Tal! -What? Is it because of my dad? -What about your dad? I saw you laughing in the pub... -You're cute. Gili! -Hey, where've you been? I was... Over there. -Where's Tal? A friend of hers came. It's a long story. "The whole way "I felt so bad. "I knew what was going to happen. "I couldn't do anything." I wanted to say goodbye. You're going into the army tomorrow. How did you know? -I know. I'm also leaving. When? -Tomorrow. -Where to? A farm near Jerusalem. -Is your lease up or... I have 4 months left. -Then why? I don't manage my life according to contracts. Do you have someone to help you move? -Yes. Someone with a red Alpha Romeo perhaps? No, no more Alpha Romeo. -Oh, someone new then. A moving company. Tal, I wanted to say... From the first time that I saw you, you've been on my mind. I keep thinking about you. And I love you. Let's get out of here. No, don't let him do push-ups, I'm too weak. Don't let them make you a driver. Yeah, my dad will come and sit in the back. I made you a present. -What is it? A puzzle. 36 pieces. At the end of every month scratch off the number. Until you're discharged. -And what then? Wait and see! -It's a great timetable. Cool. Thanks. Gili, that's unnecessary. -What is? Physical contact. It's unnecessary. Nothing. Why is it nothing? -Come here! Come closer... Move your hands over my body. No! No touching. As close as you can get without touching. You're touching! Don't let physical contact destroy what we have. Why would it destroy? -It should come at the end. At the end of what? -At the end... When will the end come? You'll be the first to know. Platoon 2! You're not soldiers. Timetables mean nothing to you. Your weapons are filthy. Your tents are filthy. I've told you several times. Your attitude determines mine. The entire company stays for the weekend. Is that clear? -Yes sir, commander sir! "Let's dive, "Let's fly far away. "Even for one night." What? Hello. I know exactly what you're thinking, buddy. Do you have a problem with that? Making money? You're in the army and I'm making big bucks. You might say that I'm a mean money-making machine. All the dealers think they can trick the kid. But I show hem when's what. Good for you, bro, great. -The king, that's it. No, not a king. You know what? I'd trade it all, everything I have, just to hear: "You have 30 seconds!" Cut it out, that's peanuts for you. -Come on. Bro, why don't you catch a cab? Why, what's wrong? -You sang really nice. Didn't she sing nice? -Yeah, wonderful. Thank you. She sang nice. -And my taxi is waiting... Do you happen to have... a driver's license? Yes, why? -I've been drinking. I need someone to drive me home, in my car. Doesn't your friend have a license? No I don't. Eight tests but... In the end I'll get it. I'm sure I will. So how do I get home? -We can start at your place. Okay, I'm... Where did he go? -He took your taxi. The girl you were talking about, the one you love... Does she love you? That's it, I don't know. -So she doesn't. I'll be right back. Well... You can congratulate me! We're here today to celebrate. I got a car as my discharge present. Peugeot 205, 4 owners, but in great condition. Isn't it, bro? Great condition! My dad probably realized. Really, since the slap... that I've calmed down. I mean, he knows I'm a bit crazy. But I've been a good boy concerning driving. I've been a real good boy, I drive well. So he took responsibility and went all the way. Now we're taking the Peugeot out for a ride on the Arava road. Mili, Liz and I are coming full circle. A kind of class reunion. Danny is coming on his motorcycle and... Only you, geek, are coming on a plane. Only that's good enough for you, you s.o.b. You can't come with us in the car. You see, he goes 1st class. He has the money, so it's a waste of time. I hope it'll be as good as it was then, cool. Only one thing is missing for everything to be perfect. Hello? -Hello, Tal? What's up? It's Gili. Hi. -How are you? -Okay. That's it, the picture is complete. Hello! How is it? It's great... beautiful It means I'm discharged. Congratulations. -Thanks. We're celebrating, apparently in Eilat. Shachar, do you remember him, he invited us all over to his suite in Eilat. At his expense. I thought that you might want to join us. No, I don't think I can. -Too bad. Are you sure? Because it will be really awesome. Well, I might surprise you. We'll see. I'll be happy. I love surprises. "When will you see with your own eyes. "Touch with your own hands. The road to you. "When will you see with your own eyes. "Touch with your own hands. The road to you. "When will you see with your own eyes. "Touch with your own hands. Know in your thoughts, "That the road to you passes through my heart." Eilat. Friday, 11:30 a.m. Hello. Koren. I reserved the Russian Suite. Yes. Please fill out the form. How are you paying? -What do you prefer? Tell me that it wasn't worth it. It was worth it. This definitely is the same suite. Worth every penny, right? -Brings back memories. What a trip! It's so lovely here. Shachar, the luggage is here. Here you are. -Thank you. Hey, Mili, the same chocolates. -Don't you dare eat them. Here you are. -That's all, sir. This is for you. -Thank you very much, sir. Just a minute. -And this is for the lemons. Thank you very much, sir. The night with the lemons was unforgettable. I can still taste them. Wine, anyone? -Yes! Eilat. Friday, 3:20 p.m. What's wrong? -Nothing. Everything's fine. Danny, is your head better? -Yeah, a little. So, come with us. -No, I'd rather not. Take a pill. It'll help. No, I'll go to sleep. When will you be back? Around 9:00. -Get better, buddy. Eilat. Friday, 7:10 p.m. I'm in the middle, I'm in the middle. When did he say he was coming? 15 minutes. First of all, cheers for Shachar. You s.o.b.! Give it to her! Eilat -Friday 10:30 p.m. Look, I don't believe it. -Shachar, it was worth it. The bastard has a headache. He took a lot of aspirin. -Go for it, go for it! I don't believe this. Give it to her, bro! That's it. Now you got to Tel-Aviv. You found a cassette in your bag. You didn't know what it was. You put it on 'play'. You saw me and you didn't have a clue. Eilat, Saturday night, 12:30 a.m. Look, I don't know why I'm talking to the camera. Maybe because I don't feel like seeing your face. Or maybe the camera is my best friend, because you're not my friend, that's for sure. You see. I once loved someone. You know I did. I told you about her and introduced you to her. You even advised me on how to get her, and how not be nervous. Then you went and fucked her. You could have had anyone you wanted. Every girl you looked at, you just had to look in her eyes, and she would want to fuck you. But you had to have her. Why? So your best friend Gili, your poor, shy friend, wouldn't have someone better than you. You had to because you're the coolest. You're number one, the best in everything. You know I loved her. Do you know what love is? You knew I spent three years in the army. When I was in the mud, in shit, on marches... I'd take out her picture, the one she gave me. Get it, she gave me a picture of her. I'd look at the picture. I thought about her smell, her voice, her laughter, and everything would fade. You turned out to be some bastard. You don't know how much I loved her. And you don't know how much you hurt me. Gili, I'm sorry. I didn't know. -You didn't know. You had every reason to know. -I didn't know. Gili you were in the army. 3 years. You had girls. Nothing. Air. No body, no face. Just you. And me, like an idiot, with your picture... Thinking that you were waiting for me. I thought about you a lot. Really? You're touching. Don't let physical contact destroy what we have. Eilat, Saturday, 12:55 p.m. Gili, Gili, Gili... Turn around, Gili. Come on, smile. We're going home. There's nothing else to do. Girls, and a skip to the car. Come on, Shachar. Okay, guys. Our last time in Eilat. They have no manners even in a gas station. Here, bro. -Is that for me? I'll give you mine. We won't have money for gas. "Maybe God is trying to leave." We were in Eilat. We played on the beach. We looked and refreshed our eyes. Gili, I can't feel the wind! Faster! Do 100. "And if there is some God" I had no idea what he was going through, that Saturday morning. If I had known, maybe everything would have been different. Subtitle production: Elrom Studios
