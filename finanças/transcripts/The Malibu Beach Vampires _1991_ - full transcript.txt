(thunder sounds) (eerie sounds) - I am Bruton Contra Double. Star of marine and material obscene. Gull of goats and slips of you. Boat of mischief and monkey business. But in a minister to all that is sinister. Enchanting you what you put in. - Boil, boil, toil and trouble. Fire burn and marine bubble. Bag of loot and I mandate. This Marine will meet his fate. By the pricking of my thumb something wicked this way comes. (thunder sounds) - Boil, boil toil and trouble. Fire burn and ocean bubble. But in a minister to all that is sinister. Enchanting all that he puts in. By the pricking of my thumbs something wicked this way comes. (upbeat music) - Uh congressman, now that you have lost presidency and will be soon be voted out of office. Was it worth the few moments of pleasure? - Well, I have to say in all honesty, I had a helluva good time. (upbeat jazz music) Oh boy, I'll tell ya. If the taxpayers could have seen how gorgeous those gals are. They would know their money is well spent. (chocking gagging sound) (jazz music) - Who could have believed. It seemed it was yesterday I was standing in line to take a bath. In a little tin barrel outside of our shack. (reminiscent orchestral music) - Let the heavens open and send force down to this poor sinner. (Heavenly music playing) Rise and walk again. - Mr Fargo, my English in high school. He inspired me to be the actress I am today because he failed me in English. (laughs) (upbeat music) (sighs deeply) - Well call me the Rocket Scientist. (jazz music plays slowly) - And now what? - Colonel West, What exactly is your relationship with your secretary? - Yes Colonel West, just what is your relationship with your secretary? - For your information, there is nothing going on there. God made my secretary beautiful because of that people may snicker and say, " Oh, there must be some sort of hanky-panky going on there." Because of that. - Colonel, what about this bikini that was bought with CIA money? - Yes Colonel, what about the bikinis bought with the CIA money? - (chuckles) I had forgot about that bikini. Until the other day my wife had said to me, "Hey ya knucklehead, don't you remember you bought it for me for our 15th wedding anniversary? - Now tell me Colonel, have you ever had a love affair? - Yes Colonel, have you ever had a love affair? - Is there a goddam echo in here or something? - Yes I have. I have a had a love affair, for 15 wonderful years. And I've had this wonderful affair with my beautiful wife. The mother of my children. (Heavenly calm music playing) - This is Reverend Fakker saying, "Give, so that the little orphan girls can live." - My campaign theme is, We need a Harmonizer, not a Womanizer. - Why you. Ladies and gentleman, I'm in this campaign not to for any other reason but than to make a meaningful exchange on the issues in society. I'm not a womanizer, and for once and for all, we're going to set those issues aside. I challenge every one of you reporters to follow me around. See what I'm up to and I guarantee it.

I need to go. - I'm enchanted by you. Is that your house? - Yeah, we timeshare. - What do you say I take you out and teach you how to surf. - I've heard that line before. No thanks. - Why not? It's a great day. The waves are perfect. - No. - Why? - I said no. - Please. - Don't beg. - Why then? - I have to go. - Wait, why? - You're keeping me against my will. Leave me alone. - Just tell me. - You really wanna know. - Yeah, I really wanna know. - I'm from another world. - Come on. Are you serious. All right, let's hear it. (eerie music) - I'm from the underworld. From time to time we surface. To expose the evil in the world. Those who expose others for profit and seek gratification. In our way, we provide retribution. And we punish those who rob and lie and exploit others for their evil means. We bite into them, we don't suck their blood but we inject a truth serum. And our victim must tell the truth or die. - I don't believe a word of that. Okay, all right! - You think I like being this way? - All right. I'll try to help you. You gotta promise not to bite me. (girl chuckles) - I just wanted to tell everybody out in TV land how wonderful my team is. Who could have believed. Seemed like yesterday that I was standing in line to take a bath in a little tin barrel outside of our shack. I had no where to go, I one of 14. But you rescued me. You're my prince charming. I love you. (romantic soft music) - Oh don't be picky on TV, Please, please don't. (band music playing) (tap dancing heels clicking) - Welcome sinners. Let's have a big hand for the Tim and Pammy dancers. (applauds) We are honoring today, our armed forces in Saudi Arabia. Bless their little hearts. They are the ones who keep our oil flowing. - Yes, amen. You know Pammy people often accuse us of being carpetbaggers. Well, we may be from Michigan and Minnesota. But our hearts in the country.

(rejoicing) (folk music playing) (tap dancing shoes clicking) (door closes) - Come along girls, I want to show a little tour of the house. We have the family room through that hall. And that's where the TV is. And here we have stereo. I hope you bought some tunes to boogie down to, I know you girls love to dance. And the kitchen is right through that other hallway. I stocked the refrigerator with plenty of yummies. But anyway. My hubby and I won't be around to distract y'all. We're just going to go along to the store and we'll be back in about an hour. Anyway, enjoy. Bye. Make yourself at home (laughter) - [Group] Party! (giggles) - Oh this is so great! Look at this furniture. - You know I can even hear the ocean. - I have got dibs on this down stuffed couch. - I don't mind the floor. - Oh god. How you do get any guys all the way hell out here. - God Dottie, do you have to start every sentence with god? - Maybe. - Do you think we really need guys. They're such a pain. - No guys? No way. I mean are you crazy? - Dottie maybe Morgan's right. Why don't we sit here and do each other's make up. See which one of us looks more like Christie Brinkley. - Oh Morgan, wouldn't you just love to look like Christie Brinkley. - I already do. - Ladies, ladies. Have you not learned a thing from me? I mean Malibu, stars, white sands. A totally radical beach house, and a killer bikini! (giggles) - Stop. - Dottie! Dottie! Tonight we are taking no victims, anyway you're engaged again. So why make any post puberty admirers suffer at your feet. - All right. I get the visuals loudly. No boys. Anyway, you need some help with your make up. - I don't wear that mucky, unnatural slop. - My point exactly. Your problem is that you look too much like you. You're not supposed to recognize a shred of your former self. - I think you've been in for too many shock treatments. - No, but your hair looks like somebody after shock treatment. Trust me. I can transform you. - I wonder if your think abour normal things, like college. - Ladies, ladies. Come on. Christie, why don't you go and scope things out, all right. and I'll get ready for Morgan's makeover. (Dottie chuckles lightly) - Oh, how that bathroom looks exactly like a Turkish bath. - You guys don't even know what that means. If it were a Turkish bath. It would be filled with men. - Look down, we're on sun up. - Fat old men with bad breath. - My name is Bond. James Bond. (girls squealing) There is a walk-in closet back there, that is just stuffed with evening gowns, cashmere sweaters. I'm talking Albert Nipon, Donna Karan. I am talking heaven. Come on - [Group] Oh my god! - Take this, take this. - Oh my God! It's a wedding gown. I just hope it can fit. - Dottie! It looks really tiny like a size three! Thought you were a five. We were always taking in your stuff. - Well I'll just act like a size three. - Dottie, Dottie! You're gonna make it rip. - Oh! - Dottie! Every time you get us into some kind of trouble. - Like that time you tried to pick up that guy in the front house. It turned out to be her father. - Yes. And what happened to us at St Patrick's Day when you promised that green stuff was just a temporary hair rinse. - Right. - Well I don't know. - Oh and she takes my father's car, that's is a convertible, down to the auto wash, with the top down! - Yeah! Or, or. What about when we snuck into the driveway in the trunk of that car. - Oh my god. And she drops the keys down at the storm parade. - It could have happened to anybody. - Ladies, we're back! Let us know if you need anything. Oh! And just one thing. Don't touch any of those costumes. It's a practically a priceless collection worn in famous movie scenes. Reverend Fakker is quiet a movie aficionado. - Aficionado? - Like how Chuck feels with you? - I think she worships him - For what? - It's a good thing we were forced into Mr Estee's advanced sewing class after Miss Higgins cracked up the Calculus last year. Even you can do it. Sew it Dottie. - Yeah, I'll fix it. There you go. I told you I could transform you. You look so pretty. - Thanks. - Oh my rings. - Oh god, not the rings again Dottie, please. - See, Morg has never seen them once. - No, ts her sicko trophy collection. You know guys that yearn and then got spurn. - [Group] Laughing. - Look, I can't find the diamond. - It's right the in the center. - Next to that bit of fuzz stuck to the. - That's a pearl! - Come on Dottie. Their love ran about as deep as those diamonds. - No, I mean I didn't show her when they was engraved yet. I mean look. - To my Shiela, all my love forever. Reverend Fakker. - Sheila? - Hmm. - Sheila was the girl who should have got the ring but Dottie elbowed in there and of course put a stop to it. - So he turned around and gave it to Dottie and she took it? - No, no. Far more complicated than. You see Sheila threw it at Dottie in a rage and it actually stuck in Dottie's hair mousse. - [Group] Laughing. - Well my daddy's an attorney and he said the possession is not his in the law. So, it's mine now. - Oh where would we be as children without fathers to mold our budding morality. What's this? It looks just like you. But it isn't. Is this your mother? - My father still talks about her. - What's wrong? - You know Morgan, its okay if yo don't like how you look. I understand. - I'm really nothing but good grades, perfect grammar. Everything I do is planned. From Stanford, to the way I picked my wedding engagement. The beach. (sobs) - I am so sick of you. Its always Morgan, Morgans mother, Morgans problems. You think that because you are so perfect, that we have to be your servants and your slaves to your beauty. Your mother is dead. - Stop it. Stop it. - Well look at me. I am fat, I am gross. I'm unpopular. I'm totally pregnant. (Sobs) - Don't cry. - Lets talk about Mr Fargo Yeah (chuckles) - Mr Fargo. He is such a babe. - Yes, there you go. - Right - Janet Jasper sits in the front row of Family Psychology. And she can actually see him flexing his butt muscles during class. - All right, that's wild. - That's obscene. - There's nothing obscene about those great little butts. - Yeah, well Dottie should know. She's the one who has lots of pictures. - Yes, those bend over pick up and throw on the waist band. Well they call me the little rocket scientist. - Give me a break. Yeah I do have a dream. - Tell us - A real dream. - What? - I can see it like if it was really happening. I'm up on this stage, And there's this huge crowd below me. And everyone is dressed to the nines in minks and diamonds. (chuckles) - Who are you, Joan Collins or the Queen of England. - I'm someone whose just like Cher. (Giggles) - And the award goes to. Christie Shannon. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. Oh god, I'm totally speechless. But, it wouldn't be right unless I thanked everybody in my life that has made this possible. Starting with Dr Osborne, who helped turn me around while I was still in my mothers womb. And Mr Ramer, who helped fix my teeth and let's see. Mr Fargo, my English teacher in high school he inspired me to be the actress I am today because he failed me in English. And Mr Bob, who made me what I am today. Totally blond. Oh my god thank you so much. And my two bestest friends in the whole world. Dottie and Morgan. Thank you so much. (squeals) What are you doing? You're just mad because you weren't even nominated. Get away from me. Stop it! Stop! Get away What are you doing, I'm pregnant! (screams) (gunshot) - Oh girls look at these hunks I found on the beach. Aren't they wonderful? (singing soprano opera music) (dreamy orchestra music playing) - Who knew about this weapon exchange with so-called freedom fighters? Did your superiors know? - Sure did. You bet. - And what about the money for those bikinis? (Colonel West chuckles) - I'd forgot. Whoops. Oh yeah the bikinis. (chuckles) Ah, those went to the best set of mistresses this side of heaven. Oh boy. I'll tell you, if the taxpayers could have seen how gorgeous those girls are, they would know their money is well-spent. (choking gagging sound) - Not going to take the fall for you or for anyone. I'm not going to be your mousey bimbo slave anymore. Its time for the secretaries of the world to stand up for themselves and not cover up of their bosses anymore. Just tell the truth. - All right. I will. I'll tell the truth okay? - Don't you think its a tragic waste of lives of men. Lives of women. Lives of innocent children by giving weapons to the Contras. In spite of the fact that the people of this small, central American country have voted in democracy on their own without our interference? Don't you think its wrong to avoid our legally elected congressional representatives wishes when they said no to any weapons in the Contras. Who made you god? You have blood on your hands Colonel West. - Forget it! I can help tell the truth. (chocking) (pensive music) (silently shouting) - [Invisible Voice] Hey Joe. - They call him Joesph! (invisible voices whispering "Peace Now") (Colonel West panting) - What are we fighting for? - This! - [Invisible Voice] You're using DDT! - [Invisible Voice] You're killing innocent insects. - DDT is good for you and me will set us free! - [Invisible Voice] Your mother wears army boots! - So what if she does? I love her anyway. - [Invisible Voice] Burn the flag, burn the flag! - Don't you touch this flag! Don't you touch this flag! (invisible voices whispering "Peace Now") (dramatic music) - Colonel, who was responsible? I mean, who gave the orders? I mean, who decided to give money to the Contras? I mean, who was calling he shots son? - Yes Colonel, who was calling the shots? - I did. - By yourself? You mean you took it all on yourself? - You did it by yourself? - I take a lot of initiative. - I mean, how could just a few Marines create such a mess? - Yes Colonel, how could a few Marines create such havoc? - Never underestimate the Marine Corp. You see these ribbons? Each ribbon us for a Marine who gave his life for his country. They never ask what the Vietnam War was about. - Yeah son, I've been asking myself that for years. - Yes, I've been asking myself that for years. - And I can answer that with an emphatic, "I don't know!" But what I do know sir, is that once the Marine Corps left South-east Asia four million people were killed in Cambodia. You see those Marines, they never questioned why or what their duty was. There was no college deferment for them they died. They died proudly, I know, I was there. You see we're looked at as your white trash sir. Your white trash that fights your wars. You white trash that you use on your personal chessboard. But tomorrow will be a better day for America because we have the Marine Corps. I delivered the weapons sir. I initiated everything for the Contras. I planned the whole damned thing. If my president says stand on my head. I'll do it sir. And I'll do it proudly. (sighs) I only ask that innocent people are not indiscriminately killed. We will be beat the foe, no matter how powerful or insidious he may be. Semper Fi! (soft electric music playing) - I don't know where I'll be in the event that I am assassinated as was Dr. Martin Luther King, Harvey Milk and John Kennedy is my duty. Yes, my obligation to reveal these following facts. This congressman Terry Upstart is a womanizer and not just with wine and ice. With a famous soap opera star who has her own soap brand. And with a movie star who not only has her own perfume but her own chain of malt shops. When he said he was going to Nicaragua, he was really going to Puerto Vallarta with these women. Now there's this old chap, Colonel West. He used CIA monies to purchase a Land rover, women's underwear and when he hit the beach. It wasn't in Grenada, it was on the French Riviera. Yeah, there's this poor old soul Reverend Fakker, says that his flock should take care of their shepard. Boy believe me, they sure did. When I'm gone, perhaps Bill should lead the movement. Well, he sleeps around. Could be Cynthia, she's a jerk. Or could be Juliet, whose a chaser of lost causes. Anyhow, the movement will no die with me. So rise you, poor and underprivileged. Disenfranchised of America. Rise you the unwanted lowest of low. Tomorrow will be a better day because of you. (soft electric music) - I don't know where you'll be when you get this tape. You may be in the shower. You may be in the bedroom with nothing on but a towel. With your body wet and your hair wet and wild. Then you'll have nothing on except the radio. You may hear my voice and it may inspire you to. (inhales and exhales deeply) (soft electric music) (fireworks sound) - Brothers and sisters Tammy and I have just thought of the ultimate evil. An evil that is sweeping across the country and possess the very souls of our young people. It is an evil and a corruption that is so great that doctors even say that the hearts, the hearts of our young people are beating faster because of its influence. Well we know what that evil is. Ladies and gentlemen that evil is Rock n Roll. And here to sing a song about a music form that is pure and wonderful and will last forever is our own sister Sue and our brother Steven. Let's welcome them all here ladies and gentlemen. (applause) Hallelujah! (Sues sings folk song) - Rock n Roll has had its day! (Steven sings) Come on America, Let's start having fun! Hallelujah! Rock n roll is dead and gone and disco's faded away. - Amen Hallelujah. - Thank you. - Thank you brother Steve and you brother, sister! (Reverend Fakker laughs) Thank you very much. God bless you. (Sister Sue sings and plays guitar) (upbeat music) - Ladies and gentlemen across our studios here today we have clotheslines and clothespins and bedsheets. And I, I wanna hear the rattling of dollars and not the jingle of coins. So place your money up on clotheslines and bedsheets now. Oh thank you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. I thank you and the little orphan girls thank you. Now is there anyone here in our audience today that is in need of special healing? - I wanna be healed brother Fakker. And so you shall. Come down, come down. The lord will show you favor because he loves you. And he will heal you. As I have the spirit and the spirit is in me. And it shall be in you. And if you truly and honestly believe then god will heal you. - I believe, I believe! - Then let us join in prayer and by the power vested in me. Can the heavens open and send forth down to this poor sinner. Let them heal because he believes and he wants to walk again. He's going to walk again. And as I believes, he believes. And the spirit in me is now in him. By the power vested in me, with the help of the lord. - Heal him! Heal him! Heal! Now, rise! Rise and walk again! He did it! Ah, musical number please, fast. Fast, musical number! (Sister singing gospel guitar music) (fireworks cracking) - Ladies and gentlemen, campaign supporters. Today I have an announcement to make. I will occasionally glancing at my notes but I can assure you. Ladies and gentlemen, campaign supporters, friends and members of my family. Today I have a major announcement to make. I will be glancing at my notes but I can assure you I say this with all sincerity from the bottom of my heart. I am a fraud, a phony and a fake. I was not in this campaign for the good of my country. I was in this campaign for the good of my own ego. My own self aggrandizement. I don't want to know people. I don't want to represent others. I don't care what they think. I just want to quickly dazzle them with my superficial clean-cut image and hope to hell they get away. And if they don't get away from me, I'm going to get away from them, I assure you. Everything about me is phony, all the way down to my name. My real name is Manny Zapowitz. I changed my name because I wanted to get into one of those clubs that I thought were important to get into in order to facilitate my entrance into the social league in America. Clubs that exclude people. I now know that clubs that exclude people aren't worth joining. (soft piano music playing) Mother, today I am a man. I am proud of my heritage and I am proud of my faith. I'm the son of a European lawyer. My mother is a professor. During the war, the Nazi's had taken everything from her. Everything but her mind. Her education. When she came to America, she was able to come with the only thing she had left. Her education. She obtained her position in one of the greatest universities in this country. The University of Southern California. Ladies and gentlemen, I am what I am, I am just an ordinary man. I come to you with faults, I come to you with talents. I've come with ambitions, great ambitions and failures. I am what I am and I am just an ordinary man. (audience boos and chants turn to applause) - Congressman, do you intend to go back to politics? - Oh god no, I believe the people have spoken. - Congressman, now that you've lost presidency and will soon be voted out of office. Was it worth the few moments of pleasure? - I have to say with all honesty, I had a helluva good time. (fireworks exploding) (celebratory band music playing) - And my two bestest friends in the whole world. Dottie and Morgan, thank you so much! What are you doing? Get away from me. Stop it. Stop! Get away! (screams) - (sighs) See that outfit you've got on. All the way around? Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think we're ready to begin. As you know, I've been making a few changes around here. And some of you, in fact most of you won't be here by this time tomorrow. (popping sound) To a month. (popping sound) (sighs) - Kate? - To women's lib! - Yes. - We'll go get them. - Superiority. - Peace. Stanford. - Well, hello there. (laughs) What a delightful and delicious surprise. You know Pammy and me, we started out as puppeteers. - I didn't make Stanford. Percent changes wasn't high enough. I had everything perfectly planned. My whole life was planned. It was ruined with one stupid damned test. Its ruined. I have nothing. - Nothing? Oh come on, there's more to life than Stanford University. Why there's, there's me. There's my ministry. Our ministry. - Well? - Well. - Well? (laughs) - Well, commitment. - You know my friend Colonel West he's very fond of that word. - Are you going to divorce that walking mascara commercial or not? - Oh let me tell you about my day.(laughs) Oh it was a doozy as usual I was in need of funding to expand my empire into Korea this time. So I looked out into the crowd and did the oldie but goodie faith healing. I knew this would get the money rolling in. I said, "Who in this crowd needs to be healed?" And from a far I heard a voice. And it was the voice of sister Smith and she said "Reverend Fakker, Reverend Fakker. Heal me I cannot walk and I've been on crutches all of my life." I said, "Sister Smith do you believe?" And she says, "I believe." Then go behind the curtain. Then I heard another voice. It was the voice of brother Jones and brother Jones said, "Reverend Fakker, I've had this lisp all entire life, could you heal me?" I said, " Brother Jones, do you believe?" "I believe Reverend Fakker." Then go behind the curtain. "Brother Jones. Sister Smith, do you believe?" "I believe." "Brother Jones do you believe?" "I believe Reverend Fakker." "Then sister Smith throw away the first crutch." And she throws away the first crutch. "Now sister Smith throw away the second crutch." And she throws away the second crutch. "And now brother Jones speak." "Reverend Fakker sister smith fell on her ass." - And what'd you do? - Well I had to revert back to a standard old routine burglary. The old cripple child in a wheelchair routine. "Son, do I exploit you?" - No Reverend Fakker "Do I use you for my own self promotion son?" - No Reverend Fakker "Do I use you just to get contributions? - No Reverend Fakker "Do I use you for my own self promotion and self aggrandizement?" - No Reverend Fakker, I love you. - "I love you too, son." And with that the money came pouring in. Shout hallelujah. - Are you going to divorce her or what? - This lifestyle you enjoy requires a certain, a certain. - What? - Image of marriage stability, a wholesome all-American family life. That image that ideal. That vision. That makes all those who believe want to contribute. - I don't give a damn about anybody who wants to contribute or those who believe in you. - Well are you sure, they make all this possible. - What? - The house, the boat, the Jaguar, a decent seat at Spargo's restaurant. Do you want us to sit out there in Siberia? By the waiters quarters? And yes, yes it even contributes to little Fluffy's air conditioned doghouse. - I don't give a shit about any of this or this air conditioned doghouse. - Don't do that to Fluffy, he can only take 72 degrees fahrenheit. Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! - You can go chase after that damned dog! You love that dog more than you love me! - Oh that's not true. I love both of you, equally. All right, I'll do it. I'll divorce her and marry you that's what I'll do. No, no! (screams in pain) - And here we have Reverend Fakker sneaking out of the house. Reverend Fakker is it true you have a girlfriend in your life? - You mean girlfriends? (chocking sounds) I can't stop but to tell the truth. - Well you heard it first on WKBW Malibu. Back to you Jack. (dramatic music) - You been messing around with that woman? - Women. - Women? (Reverend Fakker screams) (snaps fingers) (Reverend Fakker screams) (snaps fingers) Thank you, praise god. I was naked and you clothed me. I was hungry and you fed me. I was lost and now I'm found. (thunder sounds) (screams) Hallelujah! I'm saved. Hey everybody, Let's dance. (upbeat music)
