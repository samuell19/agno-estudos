Speaking of, I've now put in my third formal request For a proper coffee machine at work and... I'm still waiting. - I feel so sorry for you. Not being able to drink what you want, when you want. - You really should, it's terrible. - Yeah. - You have no idea. You wouldn't understand. Does that feel better? - Mm-hmm. Now if you could get rid of the constant nausea. - Well, here's an idea. You could stay home, can relax in bed, Watching your favorite reality shows back to back. - Ah-ah-ah, no judgment. You love them just as much as me. No, I gotta go to the store and check in on Lisa. - Baby, she knows what she's doing, all right? She's a great friend. You can trust her. - Yeah, you're right. I'm just a little nervous passing my first baby over. - Well, you're gonna have to do it soon Because this baby is more important. - Okay. I will take it easy. - Okay, I gotta go. - I love you. - Rest. - Okay. Oo, oo, oo. - Do not eat that. It's not worth it. Oh. Good. - Yeah, I did that. - Great. I love you. - Still? Still.

Feeling any better? - Yeah, thanks. I took a walk and the fresh air helped so much. As I was in the area, I thought I'd drop by. - Well, sugar is literally the best medicine. I'm practically a doctor now, So I would know. - You were a dental assistant. Thanks, this is exactly what I need. Mm. Mm! Really good! - Told you. how's it going? - Good, I signed off all the deliveries this morning, Tidied the backroom, And now unpacking and writing up inventory. - I think I should come in late more often. - Well, you know you don't need to come in at all. I've got this! - I never doubted you for a second. - And I can't wait 'til you're officially on maternity So you're out of my hair. - Ha! The boss from hell. Thanks. - So proud of you, Hailey. And I'm loving these dresses, they're so cute. - I just hope you use the time To find out what you wanna do. - A store like this. My own personal wardrobe each day. Mm, you wanna go into competition. Lisa, did you check the order when you signed off delivery? - Yeah. - Well, there must be some mistake Because all the stock's in one size. - What? No, no, no-no-no, I checked it. It can't be. - It's okay, these things happen. Why don't I get on the phone to the supplier And I'll fix it? - Sorry, can I see this? - It's okay, these things happen. You're doing great. ♪ into the great unknown ♪ - Oh, come on, ref! That's offside! Who trained this guy? - Clearly biased. I wonder what he has against Springfield school. - Hey, did you ever try that ginger root tea I told you about? - Not making any difference. I thought pregnancy was this blossoming, beautiful time Of your life and I've never felt worse. - Hey, Tyler's free, he's wide open! Sorry, sis, but this one's all your own fault. - Nicole! - What? Look at you! You're eight months pregnant And you still have so much left to plan for this birth. That baby is coming whether you're ready for it or not. - Well, it's not like this is what I wanted. After this year, it's just- - no, I know. - And I had to get Lisa up to speed, And she's getting there. - Lisa? I mean, come on, I love her, but four jobs in four years? That girl is flaky. - She needed a job And I needed someone I could trust To look after the store whilst I'm on maternity. Why are you stressing me out even more? I would love to take it easy And prepare for the biggest moment of my life. It's just not working out that way. - Come on, Tyler! - Good job! - Oh, you're doing so well. I'm so proud of you. Look, mom would want you to be excited And putting your baby first. And I keep telling you, just do it my way, all right? Have the home birth. It is honestly the best thing I ever did. What's better than the comfort of our family home? All right, just do it, Hailey. Mom went in for foot surgery And she died from the anesthetic. So if you can avoid hospitals, you should. You can even use the same doula that I had. Oh, that would be so beautiful! Hey, ref, come on! Are you seeing all of this?! Her name is Riley. Her company's called heavenly sent. Just meet with her and then decide. Yes, go Tyler! all right, here we go. - What does it say? - All right, hold on, hold on. "it's better to be the head of a chicken "than the tail of an ox." Oh! - I don't know what that means. - I have no idea. - My sexy chicken. - I would be a sexy chicken. All right, your turn. - Okay. My turn. "nothing in the world is more dangerous "than sincere ignorance." - Hmm. - Maybe it's a sign I should call Riley. - It's not a sign, it's a cookie. - A fortune cookie. You know, my mom won't be there, And she'll be like my support? - Well, haven't I been there enough? - You're a great husband. - Uh-oh. There's a but. there's no but. Okay, but it's different. - Ah. - This is an experience only women understand. - Yeah, but a home birth? my sister did it. - Well, you're less than two months away, baby. I mean, is that even enough time To find a doula and prepare? - I don't know. But I don't want a labor That's gonna put me off having more kids. And mom's home makes me feel safe, even if she's not here. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Fine. Get a doula. Whatever it takes to start filling this home With as many little Joes and little Haileys as possible, Mainly little Haileys. And make this home ours, you know? New memories. I'm looking for a certain spot. Where is it? - No! - I think I found it. - Stop! - Yeah, that's it. - Stop! that's it. - Hi there, it's Hailey kendricks. I wanted to ask about your doula, Riley, And her availability please. If you could please give me a call back. I will also send an email. Thanks. "out of office until may 22nd." Great. - Breathing in. And exhale out. Again, breathing in. And exhale out. Placing one hand on your knee and one hand behind you. - Hi, sorry I'm late. The traffic is a nightmare. ladies. - Sorry. This feels so good on my back. Baby's getting heavy. - Yeah, it's getting pretty uncomfortable now. - How far along are you? - 33 weeks. - My due date's August 4th. - Shh! - Congratulations. - Boy or girl? - Girl. - Same. Congratulations. I'm jade. - Hailey. - Great to meet you. - Oh, you too! I saw it in the yoga studio And it just really stood out to me. Labor coaching? I didn't even know that existed. So, glad you found the house okay. I'm quite nervous about this, So thank you for coming at such short notice. - This is a first for me. Normally expectant mothers are- - More prepared? - No, just earlier. Well, it's been the shortest months of my life. It was my sister who thought maybe I need more support... And a fortune cookie. - My job is to make you feel comfortable. It's the most natural thing on earth. I respect your birth plan and- - A birth plan? - Have you thought about it? To have a baby? - There are lots of other factors to consider Like pain medication and what music you want playing. - Oh, a playlist. Okay. Well, I want to avoid pain medication. No epidural. Also, I have a deep fear of hospitals. - Birth is a physiological process, not a medical one. There are fewer c-sections and medical interventions With home births because you and the baby are less stressed. And it's not without risk. But if anything goes wrong, You can be in a hospital within minutes. I can massage your shoulders, We can set up some music, scented candles. - Sounds more like a day at the spa. - I'm not saying it won't be painful, But we can take away the fear. Water births are increasingly popular. The warm water's great for contractions. I wish I'd met you earlier. My husband asked if you had any references. - Out of respect to my clients, I don't like to share personal information. - Would it be possible to ask a couple for me please? I'd love to hear about their experiences. Oh, but this is great. You know, I'm excited. - Yes, well, usually I'd like many more sessions For pain management training. - Training? - And bonding time, breastfeeding, Creating an exercise regiment. There's a lot to get through. - Yeah. - Plus, due to the reduced amount of sessions, I will drop my fee by half while still making up As many sessions as possible, of course. - How about Friday afternoon? Hey. Good, yeah. Just the heartburn now. I don't know why they call it that. It's nowhere- I think someone's upstairs. - Are you serious? Baby, if you're serious, get out of there now. Call the police, okay? I mean it. Hailey. Hailey, please answer me. Hailey. Say something. - I musta left the door open. I feel so stupid. - Are you sure? - I'm fine, I'm just... Just a little jumpy. - Be careful, I love you. - Bye. It's amazing. Isn't it? A miracle. - I can't really believe she is in here. the nursery looks great. - I can't wait to be a mom. Just the birth I'm afraid of. - That's normal. How long have you wanted a baby for? - Ever since we got married, We talked about starting a family. - And your husband's supportive? He'll help with the baby? - Yeah. Yeah, he's excited. - Anxiety is the biggest cause of postpartum depression. It's a big change in your life. You're gonna need your husband by your side as a team. - Yeah. - My job is to make transition as easy as possible, But I'm not here forever. Now, for the fun part. If you take a seat. - Okay. - Deep breaths in and out. You'll be familiar from yoga. - What are you doing? - When the pain threshold hits the next level, Short shallow breaths in your nose, Out your mouth like this. - Ow! - Focus. Breathe through the pain. Harder. - Stop. - Harder. - Stop. - Harder. - Stop! - That's okay, we'll just do it again. - What? - Here's a list of items that you'll need Before the baby arrives. - Hey! Jade! It's Hailey, from yoga. - Hi! How are you? - Good, how are you? - Ugh, the back pain is something else, isn't it? - I know. - Nearly there, though. - Yeah, time has gone by so fast. Have you gotten everything ready? - I think so. - Well, I'm out on strict orders today. - I found this. Isn't it so cute? Oh, that is adorable! Did you go to fenton state? - I didn't, my partner. - My husband, Joe, he did too. - Oh! Well, I better get outta here before I max out my card. Baby stuff is so expensive, yet I want it all. I was thinking of grabbing a smoothie. Do you wanna join me? - Well, I'd love to, but I've got all this- - Oh, just a quick drink. It's important to stay hydrated. - Okay, yeah. I mean, they do not tell you half the information you need. The smoothie tasted like shoe polish. The doctor two weeks later told me it was a symptom. I had no idea. I feel like I have to apologize to this poor guy. Thank you. - Pregnancy's rough. Honestly, guys have no idea what we go through. - No idea. So, your husband, how's he coping With all your crazy symptoms? - The father isn't in the picture. But I am hoping he'll step up when the time comes. - Oh. Sorry, I feel like such an idiot now. - No! - No, that was so insensitive. I don't know why I even asked that. Do not worry. Your husband must be so pumped. - Yeah, yeah, he is. He's still getting used to the whole doula home birth thing. - That is exactly what I want! A home birth. I just haven't found the right midwife yet. - Well, I could give you her details Bea Wexford. She's great. - That would be great! - Sure! - Thank you. A natural birth is just so beautiful, When you see new life enter this world. - You haven't, have you? - Oh yeah, a ton. I've even delivered quintuplets. - You're kidding. Please tell me you're kidding. Oh, wait. Wait, so you're a midwife. - No, I deliver kittens and puppies. - Oh! - I'm a vet. But delivering babies isn't so different. - That is so cool. Okay, so you're a doctor and you... You don't want a hospital birth? - I've just seen what goes on behind the scenes, The amount of times patients get sicker After they're admitted. But I'm already on maternity leave. The second the smell of blood made me nauseous, I knew I was not a lotta use at work. - Oh, I am sorry. My meeting overran. This client is a nightmare. - Sorry, I couldn't wait. - That's all right. - I was starving. - How'd it go with the doula today? - Good! - Yeah? - Yeah. We did some more breathing exercises. - Is that normal? - Uh-huh. I lasted an entire 45 seconds without losing it. I think if I just stay in my head, it might just work. Baby, I do not envy you. I swear, if men had to give birth, There would be a lot more drugs and surrogacy. - Well, as much as I would love to switch places, we can't. So, I guess it's only fair, one year on diaper duty? - Oh, an entire year? Okay, you're right, two. Oh, now it's gone up to two. hi! you found the house okay? - Great, yeah. Yeah. Nice place! - Thanks. How are you feeling today? - Better. Just wish I could get a good night's sleep. - I have an amazing tip to help you sleep. - It's not more pinching, is it? no. It's all about pillows, lots of them. Take a seat. Can I have your jacket? ah, thanks. - Would you like some water? - Oh, yes please. - That's today's itinerary, Which is going to focus on breastfeeding. First off, your phone. - My phone? - I just need to install an app. While your due date is five weeks away, She could arrive any day now. - Really? - Okay, it's called get here now. It sends me your exact location. You just press this button here. - See? It's that simple. - Okay. - It opens up a map and you can track me live. I will come no matter where I am or what I'm doing. So, don't be shy. As soon as you feel a twinge Or anything you're concerned about, Press it. - Okay. - You can have many false starts, But eventually it'll be the real thing. - Okay, but... What if you're with another client? - I'm very particular about who I take on So the due dates don't clash. - Oh, yeah, those references. Did you get a chance? - I'm still waiting to hear back, but I'll let you know. oh, one moment. - Hi. - Hi. I'm jade, sorry I'm a bit early. Hailey! - Jade, hey! Hi! - Sorry, I'm early. I got my timing wrong. - No, no, you're fine. You're so big. - Have we met before? I feel like I know you from somewhere. - No, I don't think so. As you can see, I followed up on your recommendation And got in touch with bea. - Yes. Well, we are in the middle of a session, so maybe- - No, no, it's not a problem, really. I've gotta get back to the store anyway, So I'll just leave you guys to it. - No, no, don't go yet. I feel bad. - Really, it's fine. Would you mind getting my jacket? Sorry, I've got so much to do anyway. Plus, you need a doula as much as me. - Well, let me take you out for some decaf And thank you sometime. After yoga tomorrow? - Decaf? Oh, the sacrifices we make for our babies. Sounds great, thanks. - Can we meet up Friday then? actually, I'm meeting my sister. How about Saturday? Lisa! - Oh, I didn't mean to bother you, But I didn't know what to do. - You had to text, otherwise you couldn't lock up. - I put them down somewhere, But I just don't know where it went. - They'll show up when you least expect it. - I'm gonna put these with my house keys So they'll be harder to lose. Now go home and put your feet up. - You know what? I think I'm gonna stick around a bit longer. - Great class today. - Yeah, it was! How'd it go with bea? - Uh... - Not for you? Oh, I'm sorry. - No, don't be. I just wouldn't trust her with my baby. She's so young and inexperienced. You're very brave to be her first client. She did tell you that, right? No one's ever hired her. - Actually, no, she didn't. - She should've told you. Us moms need to stick together. Why don't we go out for lunch And we can look through a list of respected doulas? - I can't. Gotta head back to the store. - Still haven't switch off, huh? - Hailey, thank you so much for the invitation. I'd love to come. - Great, see you there! You should come. My baby shower, this Saturday. - No, don't feel you have to invite me. - No, I don't, you're very welcome. Us moms need to stick together. - Hey, honey, I'm just heading back for my laptop. I'll see you soon, okay? Love you, bye. ♪ losing my cool ♪ ♪ breaking my rules ♪ ♪ I don't usually get so ♪ - Are you waving? Say hi! Hi! happy baby shower, Hailey. - Oh, Lisa, thank you! That is amazing! this is Cole. - Oh, look at him! Oh. - I'm just gonna be one second, thanks. - Hey, buddy! - How are you? - Thanks for coming. - Thank you for inviting me. - I wanted to ask you something. Apparently, I'm your first client? - Um... Who said that? - That doesn't matter. Okay, you are my first, But for my business. I graduated top of my class in nursing and midwifery. And I promise you, I'm the best person for this job. - Why didn't you tell me? - Who wants to be a doula's first? - Me. Everyone has their first. I think it might be kinda special. You'll never forget my little girl, will you? - No. I really won't. - I bet Joe is hating missing out on all of this. Let's make him jealous, shall we? Come on. Big smiles. - Jade! Come here! Put it higher. Oh, there we go. - Oh, okay. Hi, it's Hailey. Are you sure this is for me? - I'm sure it's all a mistake. Lisa. - One second, okay? Yeah? - I just got off the phone with our insurance company About a claim for smoke damage. Do you know anything about this? - I told them to call me. I didn't want them to bother you with it. - Wait, I'm confused. There's smoke damage? - No. Okay, I handled it. There was just a small incident, But I took care of it, I promise, So don't worry. - Lisa. - I don't know, I musta left the iron on or something. There was just like... A small fire. - Okay, so now I gotta go back to the store. - No, Hailey, this is your baby shower. - You know what, Lisa? You should have told me. We gotta wrap this up. You know I'm not gonna enjoy myself until I check it out. - No. Everything's fine, really! - Sorry, ladies. - Where are you? I've been waiting for hours. I can't make it tonight. It's not a good time. - When then? soon. Soon. - It was my baby shower! I was supposed to switch off from work. Do I look switched off?! no. - Honey, have you seen my mom's earrings? I mean, I always keep them here. I just... I can't lose them. I mean, I must be going crazy. - Hey, all right, hey. - I'm losing my mind! - Take a breath. This is a clearly a sign that you've taken on way too much. What you need to do is stay home, take care of yourself. - Why is everyone telling me what I should and shouldn't do? Lisa should've told me. I would've sorted it there and then. - If you don't want me to go on this site visit, just say. - It's not like you have a choice. - Soon, I am going to be spending all of my time Making this our family home. - This is our home. - You know what I mean. Adding some Kendrick touches to it. Make it ours. - I couldn't sell mom's house. - All right, you know what? I'm gonna call up ted. I'm gonna tell him to take my spot because clearly- - No, don't, you know you've gotta go. I'm fine. Really, I mean it. - So... You are not going to miss your husband, hmm? - A little bit. - A little bit? - Yeah. Are you gonna miss your big fat wife? - This machine's fantastic, isn't it? Women use it right through to pushing. Completely natural, doesn't harm you or the baby. Okay, here's the first setting. Should feel that twitching sensation. You feel that? - Yep, yep, I'm feeling that. - So, you can keep turning it up as the labor progresses. - Okay. your back pain should be easing now. - Yeah. - And then you have this. It gives you a sudden electric surge When you have a bad contraction. - Okay. - Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. Higher. oh! Are you okay?! - Ow! What happened?! - Oh my god. I don't know, this has never happened to me before! One second! - Okay. I think I'm just gonna use your restroom. - One of them is gonna be my baby. oh. - I'm adopting. - Congratulations. - I can't have children; well, in the traditional sense, So I'm gonna give a child a loving home. It's a genetic condition. I've known since I was little. I'm fine with it, though. That's why I love this job. To be part of someone's pregnancy In some way is really special. To be the first one to hold that baby When they leave their mother And start the rest of their lives. I can catch the next flight out. I can be home by tonight. - No, baby, I'm fine. - All right, well I hope you're not thinking of jumping Because I don't want you getting a head start On labor without me. - Maybe. I'll see you tomorrow. Nicole! Looks like you're having more fun than Tyler. - Is Joe okay? - Joe's still pushing me to ditch that doula. - It's not too late. - You've had a change of heart. I thought you were all, "natural is beautiful." - No, I am, but not if she's a psycho. - I like her. - Hey, you okay? Sit down. - Just a little Braxton hicks. - You're making me nervous. - Okay. - Still can't find mom's earrings? - My head's all over the place since the shop nearly burned. - You try so hard to see the good in people And you keep digging deeper and deeper, And with some people it's just not there. I just don't trust bea. Look, just be careful, okay? I don't wanna lose you too. - I can't have children. I'm gonna give a child a loving home. To be the first one to hold a baby When they leave their mother's arms And start the rest of their lives. One of them is gonna be my baby. Good job, Hailey! You lasted an entire minute! You're gonna ace this. Is everything okay? - Just overtired. - If this is about yesterday, I'm so sorry. The machine- - no, you're fine. - I was hoping I might be able to meet Joe soon. - I know. I know, he's just overloaded with work. - Yeah, he seems to be. Hailey, I think I know what's going on. - What? - Joe's left you. You're scared and afraid, and that's okay. I'm here. - No! He's just out of town returning late. What, no! - Okay. I hope to meet him soon. And the sooner the better. No time for small talk during labor. Just gonna go get some swaddling blankets from the car. what were these doing in your purse? - I have no idea. - My mom's earrings, Bracelet, my jewelry! - I have no idea. - Bea, you need to leave. - Okay, I'll just come back later. - No, don't come back. I don't wanna see you again! - You're weeks away and we have so many more sessions. - Bea, you're fired! - Hi. - Hi. - How you doing? - Not bad. I mean, the kicks are more like complete rolls now. I think she takes after you. Future soccer player. Here. - Wha? Wow! Look at her little hands! - Isn't it amazing? - You need anything? Money or, I don't know, diapers? - Just more time with you. - Jade, I... - We're having a baby. - I know, and I'm gonna be there, but just for her, okay? There's no "we". - Why, you haven't even given us a chance. - Jade. I'm trying to be sensitive here, But it was a one-time thing, okay? Nothing more. I've told you, I love my wife. - You treat me like I'm some sort of filthy... I'm the mother of your child. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, don't get upset. - You can't keep your life separate, Caleb. That night, you made a decision to be with me And now our lives are bound together forever. We're gonna be parents! - Just... Just call me when the baby arrives, all right? take care of yourself, jade. - Baby... I'm so sorry. - You said you'd be home by lunch. Where were you? - I had to swing by the office first. - Instead of seeing your wife? Your pregnant wife? - No, I am sorry. I trusted her. - Look. Maybe this is for the best, you know? - How?! I'm due in a month! I have no one! I can't do this. - Hey. - I can't do this. yes you can, you have me. - That's the one thing she did get right. You're never here. I share you with work. - Look, you are obsessed with your work too, baby. I mean, that's just what we do. - But I can't anymore! My life's changing so much and yours isn't. - You're right. You're right. Look, from now on, I am going to be here for you. You are the most important thing in my life And you aren't doing this alone. Hey, look at me. We're gonna be okay. - I'm scared. - I know. your baby looks very healthy. You're doing a great job, mommy. - Wow. That's the head. Wow. - I'm going to let you clean up And I'll see you at the front desk for copies of your scans. - Thank you. - Thank you. See, I told you, everything's fine. - Good. - She's perfect. - Joe. I want the home birth. I know it didn't work out with bea, But I don't wanna go into a hospital Unless it's an emergency. It's what my mom would want. - Okay. Whatever you want. - Hailey, what are you doing here? - Well, at least somebody was. If you need to head out, You gotta tell me so I can get cover. - Well, you're not even supposed to be working. You're supposed to relax. - Excuse me for not finding any of this relaxing. Missing keys, the shop nearly burning down, Finding it shut during in the busiest time of the day. - Well, I'm sorry I'm not as perfect as you, Hailey. - That's not fair. I gave you a chance when others said I shouldn't Because I believed in you. And now, this is how you repay me. - Wow. Wow. it's a perfect sunny Sunday In California. In your car, home, or at work, Thanks for choosing us to join you on pulse 73. - Hailey. - Huh? - That better be for Joe. You know Camembert isn't good for the baby. - Oh! Oh, yeah. Yeah it is. How are you doing? - Partly counting down the days And partly wishing the day never comes. - Oh, yeah, I know. - How's Joe? - He's good. He's good, yeah. How are things with the boyfriend? Any better? - He's really busy with work, Which is tough. You know, being on your own. Late nights, work trips. I'm sure you know what that's like. - Yeah. - What does Joe do again? - He's an architect at Lodwell's. - Oh. - I'm sorry, I think you told me, but- - An engineer. Don't ask me exactly what he engineers, But gives him a good excuse not to be home much, Which is why us ladies have to stick together. How's that girl anyway, bea? - It didn't work out. - Do you still want a home birth? - Well, I'd like to, but I'm running outta time. - Let me do it. I've delivered hundreds of babies. - Well, you know, it's probably at this stage Not even worth it anymore. - I'm joking. Your face! - This just isn't exactly how I envisioned my pregnancy. - I say good riddance. She stole really personal things for quick cash. I mean, your mom's earrings? She's a monster. - It just doesn't make any sense. Why? She's been calling me, telling me I've got it wrong. I don't know, maybe I should give her a chance to explain. - As a medical professional, my advice: Isn't it time to stop with these witch doctors? - That's a bit unfair. - I mean, a doula's what? Two hours online for a certificate? - Bea's a qualified midwife. Many are. - My point is let's be each other's support. I mean, who knows better what you're going through With the pregnancy than me, right? - Yeah. - When the time comes, let a doctor step in and do the rest, But you don't need to hire someone To help you with the pregnancy. That's what I'm here for. Why don't we go for a walk after work tomorrow? Obviously, broken up with breaks every five minutes. Yeah. Sorry, would you mind? It's my sister. I gotta take this. I'll be one second, sorry. - Please. - Sorry, sorry. Hey, Nicole? - If you had just listened to your sister from the start, You wouldn't have wasted all this time. I don't know why Riley's not getting back to me. Maybe she's on sabbatical? I mean, we talked about her dreams of traveling around Asia, But that's going back seven years now. Oh my god, how do I have a seven-year-old? - Good afternoon. Are you here for an ultrasound? - Hi, Lionel. It's me, it's Nicole. I don't know if you remember. - How's Tyler doing? - Oh, he's good! He's so big now. He's not my little baby anymore. - Any brothers and sisters? - Of course not. I would've come to see Riley, which is why I'm here. Not for me, obviously, But my sister is in urgent need of a doula And I want her to have the best. - I guess you haven't heard? I thought she was getting better. She was taking time out to mourn. mourn? - A client. Her baby died. She went into labor early And Riley couldn't make it in time. She blamed herself. I knew she was struggling, but I never thought- - Riley always treated me like I was family, So she must've mourned like it was her own. - She called me minutes before to leave a voicemail. - I don't deserve you. I love you. - She sounded fine. Said I didn't deserve her. I'm not sure what I did, but minutes later... I'm sorry. So, you need a doula? - I had one, but it didn't work out. - Anyone I'd know? - Bea? Bea Wexford? - Bea Wexford! How's she doing? - You know her? - Know her? She was my wife's prodigy. I haven't seen her since the funeral, But I always really liked her. Riley trained her up, Had nothing but good words to say about bea. She stole from me. - Thank you, that's the first laugh I've had in weeks. Bea inherited a fortune. She doesn't need to work, but she chose this career To make a difference, just like my wife did. - There you are. Can you get the drinks? - We need to talk. - Not tonight, I'm not in the mood. Let's just eat and watch Netflix, okay? - It can't wait. - Unless you're telling me we've won the lottery, I don't wanna hear it. Let's just save it for the counselors next week. I can't. I don't know how to say this. - Did you sleep with someone? - Oh my god. Oh my god, I knew it! I knew it! Ugh! - It was a one-night stand, okay? Just the once. It was while we were on our break. It was a big mistake, okay? I regretted it instantly. I love you with all of my heart! - You lied to me! - I know. - You lied to our counselor! - I know. - You lied to everyone! What's the point of any of it, huh?! - Just didn't wanna lose you. - Yeah right, whatever. - There's more. - What? - The woman... It's mine. - What? - It happened only once, I swear! If you let me, we can work on this. Okay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll do whatever it takes, just give me a chance! why didn't you tell me? - I'm so, so angry with him. - But you love him. - I do. For my sins. - Do you know who? - No. He won't say. But I have a right to know, right? I mean, I'm gonna be a stepmom. - Do you need a couple of days to figure it out with Caleb? I feel good. I can manage. Please. - Thanks. - I just cannot believe Caleb, you know? I never thought he would do something like this. - Maybe they can work it out. - Well, what about us? Have we worked things out? - I think you still have some making up to do. - Oh, I do? Okay. what's that? Honey, what is that? - Stay here, okay? Stay right there. I'm just gonna go try this on. - Okay, great. Right over there. - Your pick-me-up. ah, thanks. - You really shouldn't be on your feet, okay? - I just can't stop thinking about it. - I followed up with the police. They said they're checking the cameras for prints, But it's gonna take a while. You know, bea has been in our house a lot. - No. - And with the jewelry- - No, no, why would she? - Will you promise me You will let me take care of this, okay? I will find out who's responsible. - Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! You can't face me?! Are you a coward?! - I don't have to talk to you! - If that's my husband's baby, We're gonna be seeing a whole lot more of each other. - I doubt that. He's been desperate to leave you for months. He loves me. - We're not letting some loose tramp ruin our marriage. - You're pathetic. He doesn't want anything to do with you! - Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Here, let me help you. What's that? - Don't apologize, sweetheart. - Hailey! - Jade, hey. - Hailey. - How are you? - Good, are you okay? I didn't hear back about getting together. Thought we were supposed to be each other's support system. - Oh, yeah, sorry, I meant to respond, But I've just not been feeling up to it. - Well, then you need me now more than ever, With the birth in a month, your hospital date so close, Overcoming your fear after what happened to your mom. You can't go through this alone. Bea stealing from you and putting cameras around your house. - Were you after anything in particular? - Yes, something light and flowy If you have anything that'd go over this big thing. Oh, that is perfect. - Sure. Here you go. I'll take it. - You don't wanna try it on? - No, it's great. - That'll be $65 please. - Are you okay, Hailey? - Yeah, it's just Braxton hicks. - And you're still working? - I'm fine. Really. - I hope so. Us moms need to stick together. Thanks. - Nicole, she knew about mom, about my fear of hospitals. Dr. Jade Goddard. - Your bouquet is ready. - And that it was mom's earrings that were stolen. I never told her any of that. She could only know through the cameras. - Good afternoon, can I help you? - I'd like to drop off flowers for my friend. Is jade Goddard working at the moment? - Oh, unfortunately no. She's on maternity leave still. - Actually, do you know When she'll be returning back to work? - It's all a bit up in the air right now, As she didn't intend to leave so suddenly a month ago. It depends on how her daughter progresses. Have you met her little girl yet? - No. - Poor thing. I don't even know if she's outta the preemie ward yet. Well, thank god for her doula Standing by her every step of the way. - I'll drop by her house later. Thank you. - Your flowers! - Lionel, I need to know if that was your wife's patient. - It's her. - She has a bump, a very big bump, And she's been showing up at my yoga class And she was at this- - that's not possible. - Do you know who the father was Or any way to contact him, any family? I think she needs help. "depression. "vulnerable patient. "fostered. "no relationship with foster family. "highly abusive upbringing. "possible PTSD. "likely candidate for postpartum.

There we go. Hello? Caleb? oh my god! Caleb, what's wrong? It's Lisa, she's dead! The police rang and they want me to come and identify her!

It was a miscarriage. Killing me won't bring your girl back and you know that. - She was my entire world. The one chance at the family I never had. I just had to kill bea and Joe And it just all woulda been easy. - You were fostered, right? I know you're gonna make a great mom. I know because you're never gonna let your child Suffer like you did. Jade. Why don't we find someone who can help you, you know? You don't have to go through this alone. - I am not alone.

What has she done to you? Caleb, come on. - As if a mother would give up on her family that easily. - Don't do this. - You. I didn't want it to end like this. Well, maybe I did. - They'll lock you up. You'll never see your baby. - No one will find us and dawn will have a loving home. - She's my baby! I'm mia's mom! - You are not a mom! You put my baby in so much danger With that stupid pubescent doula. They're not to be trusted, And you kept working and putting stress on my baby. My baby! Not even a fire would stop you. You never put dawn first! - And a good mom wouldn't keep a gun in the house. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Hey. Hi. Baby mia. Isn't she beautiful? - I shoulda been there. - You were there. All I saw was you there with me, by my mom. - Mr. And Mrs. Kendricks.
