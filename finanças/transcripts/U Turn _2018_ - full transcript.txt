Your brother has some visa issue. He says he’s not sure if he can make it. Even if he managed to come, he can’t possibly return. I don’t know what to do. He’ll definitely come if your wedding date is fixed. Mom! Stop asking the same thing. I’ll leave if you irritate me. I knew you’d say that, You yell at me no matter what I say. Mom, why do you get into an argument and spoil my mood? I have to get you on the bus and go to work. Your dad toiled hard and took debt to fund your engineering course. You could go for a better paid job. Why’d you take up this shitty job? Mom, no matter how hard you try, my decision will not change. Why would you change? Of course, you wouldn’t. Our neighbour Swetha is younger to you... She got married last month... She is happily settled in Washing Machine. Mom! It’s not Washing Machine. It’s Washington. - Whatever! - Washing Machine? Do you have any idea how happy she is? Your dad recently saw her pictures on Facebook and got upset... Poor guy! He was really sad. Tell me this. What haven’t we done for you? Why are you punishing us? Mom... Getting married, going abroad on honeymoon and they post pictures on Facebook... It’s not a big achievement. It's not a very big deal! Do you guys need Whatsapp and Facebook at this age? Yeah, right. If you want us to respect our age, we should be having grandchildren to play with. Bah! You don’t spare us the luck. you are back to square one. It’s all about marriage. Driver, are you married? - No, ma’am. I’m a bachelor. - Look at me. Am I beautiful? - Madam... - What are you talking? Stop near a temple on our way. We’ll get married. Only that will bring her peace. Shut up! You drive, boy. Don’t worry, madam... I’ll not marry her. I know of a lady constable in the Paradise Police Station. She’s way softer than your daughter. Listen, Rachu... I’m saying this for your own good... Quit being a reporter and take up a software job. You know marriage broker Ganesh, right? He’s in search of a nice guy with foreign green card for you... I swearing on this auto driver... If you bring up marriage one more time, I’ll jump out of the auto and run. Sure, dear. Run away... Who’s stopping you? Flee wherever you want once you’re married. Mom, do I have to recharge your phone? No need, I have balance. Hey! Why are you diverting the topic? You’ll be boarding a non-stop bus... Use the loo at the bus station. What am I saying and what are you talking about? Ask dad to use less sugar in coffee... He’s the only one to look after you. I have you, right? You promised to stay with us all your life. I’m here for you. What if I got married? Rachu... Did I just hear you mention marriage? I must be really lucky. Mom, first you need to stop watching these soap operas. You’re acting really dramatic. Oh no! I wonder if the bus already left. Mom, don’t worry unnecessarily. Look... You left the mobile back there. Maa! I know. Check again, we must’ve forgotten something. We just have two bags, maa. How much is the fare? - 70 rupees, madam... Pay me 100 bucks. - And why should I do that? You have luggage, madam... And I’ll have no passengers on my way back. Did you carry the bags on your head? I asked for 30 rupees extra. I didn’t demand dowry. One tight slap! Rachu, why are you getting into a brawl with him? Look, boy... I sent 70 rupees via paytm. Check it. - Please leave, madam. Get your daughter’s horoscope checked with those 30 bucks. Just leave! Go madam... Have you got any issues with men? You’re always fighting them. - You go first. Hey... Hi, Divya... Hi... Everyone’s about to head home, why did you come now? Did you have a long lunch in the afternoon? Forget lunch, I haven’t eaten anything. I’m really hungry. I dropped mom at the bus station and came. This Friday... You’re coming, right? Of course, no. I hate lights and noise... I’ll happily go home and doze off. - Really? Oh... Madam, Editor is calling you. It's urgent. Hello... Sir, it’s Sunder. Calling from CEO’s office... Sir, your work is complete... I also filed the returns, sir. Sorry sir! I forgot about that, sir. Can I do it in the morning tomorrow? I'm on velacheri fly over. Sir... It's not like that. Okay, sir. I’ll go back. I’ll finish it tonight. Ok sir. Bloody life! Nobody cares about what I say. Sir, one moment. You got a courier. Oh... Sorry, sir. Practice it. Yay! Dad’s home! Karthi... Hey... Hi daddy!... - Hey sweetheart... Karthi, what’d you do at school? We had a running race today. Wow! Running race, is it? Did you come second or third? I came first, dad. You came first? What was the prize? They didn’t give any prize, dad. - Are you lying because you finished last? Hey... serve dinner. Did you eat? - No, dad. - Why? I'll eat with you... Ok, let's eat. Karthi, put your slate away and finish your food first. No... No... No... I’ve found a good day care centre for Karthi. Let’s join him next week. Didn’t we discuss this already? We are not putting him in day care. What’s your problem with that? How long do I have to quit my job and stay home for him? You have me to earn a living for us. You don’t have to get a job. Before Karthi was born, I had a career for myself. I can’t give up everything and sit ideally at home. Instead, you could quit your job and stay home to look after your son. I’m already tensed. Will you let me eat in peace? If career was your priority, why’d you get married and have a kid? Hey, Karthi... It’s your friend. He went on a tour with his parents... He posted pictures on Facebook. Hey! Stop laughing. Let’s go. - Come on, move! - Dad, look! Akhila! Akhila! Akhila, open the door! Aren’t you going to open it? You’ll come out in the morning, right? Let me deal with you then. I heard the climate is cool back there. And you’re by yourself. Having a blast, huh? Yeah, right. You boyfriends are here. - My boyfriends? I’m having a gala time with them. Didn’t they tell you? You’re enjoying your time, eh? I don’t think so. By the way, what about your office crush? Any further development? No change. - Really? He’s really scared to even start a conversation. I wonder how he’d do as a crime reporter. Oh... You didn't find any other guy? Okay. Do something. - What now? - Let me finish. There’s a red colour top in my room. Lucky top... Wear that to work. You’ll succeed for sure. Succeed? How? Shall I make it simple? Let loose and you’ll have kids soon. What? Why are you silent? I was thinking of names for a baby boy and baby girl. I thought I was so bold but you’re shameless. I’ll try and let you know. - Okay bye. Hey one moment... My earrings are in the drawer... Hey! Don’t forget to clean the room. Hmmm. Ok, bye. Brother... Brother... Have we got anything today? Here you go. Hi, Rachana... - Hi... - How come you’re so early? - Are you off to a Fancy Dress Competition? Really? It’s bad? Idiots! Hello... - Hey! Yeah, tell me. Hello... Note down the number quickly. Okay, tell me. - TN 21... - TN 21... CD 7785... CD 7785... Okay. Hang up. - When will you give me the address? I'll give you... What? Are you that busy? - Yeah. Really busy... I'm struggling here... Everyone is screwing me up. Okay, I’ll call you later. Bye. Hang up. - Okay bye. Hi... You’re busy? Hey, hi... Yeah, come in. Grab a chair. Come, come sir. What else? How’s your work going on? No, not at all... Same theft and murder... Nothing new in crime. Hey, you asked for that material, right? I had it somewhere over here. I kept it here. I know I have it around here... I’ll give it to you later? It’s okay. It’s okay. By the way, are my articles of any use to you? - Of course... - Really? I read all your articles. I compare them with my notes later... It really helps me a lot. - Not bad. I just got to know someone reads my articles as well. Aditya, actually... I need another favour from you. - Yeah, tell me. Can you get me the records regarding the accident on Velacheri flyover? I take the Velacheri flyover route every day. - Oh... - But, why do you need them? I’m preparing a story about that flyover. - Ok... Umm.. I have to get the details from database once I’m free. I’ll need a couple of days’ time. Is it okay? - It’s okay. - Done. Okay. I’ll see you. Yeah. Bye. Ra... Rachana... Rachana... Rachana... Rachana...! One second... You left it back there. Your phone... It was on my table. I’m so silly. I keep forgetting. Sorry. Shall we grab a coffee? - Nah. I’ve got loads of work. I’ve to finish the article. - Of course... Of course... Of course... I’m sorry. Ofcourse I'll see you Thank you. Sir, coffee... Thanks. Here you go. - Thank you. You will like only this coffee... So... Are you from Chennai? - No. I’m from Coimbatore. Oh... We’ve shifted here just before 6 months. Okay... Okay... What does your husband do? What?! Really? Do I look like a married woman to you? I mean... You said you guys shifted before 6 months. So, you know... You can ask me directly if you want to know I’m married or not. No... No... That wasn’t my intention. You know just... Which school does your third kid go to? Do I look like a father of three kids to you? - Yes. Whoa! My third son is really young... So, I let him stay with my first wife. So, are you living with your second wife now? No, I just divorced her yesterday. Oh... - Yep. So, I’m back to ‘Single and ready to mingle’ status. Interesting... So, why’d you kill your ex-boyfriend? What’s with that look? I went to kill him. But he dumped me and left. He dumped you and left? What more was he looking for in you? I’m not stupid to market myself badly. Yes... Everyone in the office calls you a tomboy. Isn’t that enough bad marketing? Really? You’re serious? - Yep. It’s for my own good. At least the flirts will stay away. That's correct. Oh... My Editor... I just have a lot of work. Can I meet you later? Yeah, sure. See you. Rachana... Hang on. Our Editor gave me two tickets to review a movie. If any friend of yours is free, she can join me. You’re from the Crime Department, right? What do you have anything to do with movies? It’s a crime thriller. Really? A tomboy... Will be waiting for you in the parking lot, Take her along if you like her. Okay, bye. ‘Thank you for the dress.’ Hello... Note it down quickly. Name Sunder Bike red glamour, address 316. - Tell me... Rainbow apartment. What time is it? 11:30, madam... How do I go to Sunder’s house? Go straight and you’ll find a garden. Turn right from there. Your phone? Hmm... Oh, shit! Sorry. Aditya... - Hmm? Take me to a nice film next time. It’s good for the both of us. I know. I was waiting for it to end. You told me it was a crime thriller. It neither had crime nor any thrill. And it was the horror genre. I hate horror stories. Don’t you believe in spirits and ghosts? Of course, no! Why? Do you believe in them? Umm... I don’t know. - You don’t know? Isn’t that weird? I mean... There are many things we don’t know about. Ghosts, spirits, souls... They might exist. Who knows? Spirits and souls... Oh, my god! This is all rubbish. They sound good in films, stories and news articles. People like my mom believe in this stuff. It makes me angry. Forget it... Everyone has their own beliefs and likes. So, this means you believe in spirits and ghosts. I mean... I’m not saying I believe in them. But I’m saying there’s a possibility. Look over there. - Where? - A lady is draped in a white saree... With her tresses down, holding a candle. Yeah, right. She’s way more beautiful than you. Will you get down my bike, please? - Hey! Aditya, are you just like every other guy out there? What do you mean? Seeing your bike, I can say your brakes won’t function if a girl is in the back. Hey! Hello... I’m not that kind of a guy. And first of all, this isn’t my bike, it’s my brother’s... I’m using it for now. Oh... Inherited property... What’d you just say? Thanks, Aditya. I had a really boring time. Yeah. I wanted to know... Is it your birthday today? No. Why did you ask? I mean... You’re all dolled up. You seem to have taken a shower as well. - So you think I don't take a shower daily? But you really do look nice today. So, you have been observing me lately? I can’t help it, ma’am. My job compels me I’m a crime reporter, you see. - Oh... Have you been observing others as well? - No. I only observe those I have to. Oh, is it? I’ll get going, Rachana. See you in the office tomorrow. - Bye... - Bye... Hello... Wait... Come here. In here... Where’s B2 in the A block? That’s my flat. Give me a minute. Sir... She’s the girl we’re looking for. Hmm... Are you Rachana? Yeah. What happened? - I called your mobile an hour ago. Why didn’t you answer? - Oh... That's you? Why didn’t you answer my call? I... I was in a theatre, sir. Cinema, huh? The guy who just dropped you... Who is he? Sir, what do you want? Why are you asking me all this? Who is he? My friend... - Friend or boyfriend? - Sir, why do you care about that? What’s happening here? - Get into the jeep. I’ll explain everything in the station. Sir, why should I come with you? You’re at the wrong address. Check again. We’re mistaken, huh? Is this your number? Yeah. Get into the jeep silently. If you create a scene here... Public will record it and post the video on social media. Is that fine with you? We can discuss the rest in the station. Get in. Saroja, get her in! - Yes, sir! Come on, girl... Come on... Move... Sir! Sir, listen to me. Sir! Sir, listen to me. - Sir, please listen to me. - You’ll be fine. Sit down. Tell them we found the girl. We’re coming to the station. Saroja, grab her phone. - Sir... Sir... Please... - Aditya Office... He's your boyfriend? - Sir, just one call... Please... There's a tussle going on at Madipaka Junction. Send the patrolling vehicles. That night... He and I had a fight, sir. A fight? What was it about? Do you fight every day? Does your husband come home drunk and abuse you physically or verbally? No sir... That's never the case, sir. - Then? After he came home that day, while he was having dinner... I told him I'd apply for a new job... He said I don't have to do that. I got furious. I went into my room and locked the door. What job? Where did you apply? I didn't plan anything yet, sir. I just told him I'd apply. Meanwhile... Meanwhile, all of this happened. Hey, Kamala... Get her some water. Ok sir. Here you go. - Have it. Go inside. This way... Come on... Move... Narayana, is he available? - Yes, sir. Get me those files. Drink some water. Sir, she is Rachana. She was at the apartment. What's happening here? Why'd you bring me here? Sir, she's the girl who came to the flats this afternoon. Please don't mind me asking... Did your husband have an affair? Do you know of anything? Why are you asking, sir? Have you seen this girl before? Do you know her personally? Take a closer look and tell us. No, sir. This girl went to your flat this afternoon, we don't know the reason. Who are you? Why did you go to my flat? Who is she? What's the problem, sir? I don't understand what's happening. - Sir. Did you mean this girl... Look, ma'am... You can go home now. We'll have all the details by morning. Hey... Drop her home. - Okay, sir. Prabha, take her inside. Come on... Come on. Go there. Not over there. Sit here. Prabha... - Sir... Who is she? - The suspect in Sunder's case... Oh... Sir... - What are you doing? I'm preparing the case files, sir. You can do that later. Come with me. Sir... There has been a misunderstanding. Sit down! Why'd you go to Sunder's place? Which Sunder, sir? - Give me that register. Is this your name and contact? Yes, sir. You went to his place at 11:30 in the noon. - Sir, it's true that I went to his place. But I don't know him. Why are you asking me about it? You did everything you had to. And now, you're questioning us back. You think we aren't aware? Give me that photo. Look... When we reached his place this evening... He was found like this. Now tell me... Why'd you kill him? - Sir! I didn't kill him! I went to his place and rang the door bell. There was no response and so, I came back. That was it, sir. So, you didn't kill him. Am I right? Why would I kill him, sir? - That's what I'm asking you. Why'd you kill him? - Sir... Sir... I didn't do anything. You're asking me the same question on loop. Why'd you go there? Sir, I'm working as an intern in 'The Times of India'. As a part of a story for my job... I went to Sunder regarding an article... What's that story? How is Sunder related to it? It's about... - Tell me! Sir, I'm writing an article on Velacheri flyover. There are divider blocks on the flyover. Isn't that obvious? To avoid traffic jam, people move the divider blocks and take a U-turn from there. And once they leave, the divider blocks are left intact. They pose danger to people coming in the opposite direction. How is Sunder connected to this? For my story I was thinking... I trace people who move the divider block to take a U-turn and interview them. That's all, sir. So, Sunder moved the divider block... Is that why you went to interview him? Yes, sir. How do you know that Sunder moved the divider block? There's an old man sitting by the flyover. He informs me the vehicle numbers of people moving the divider blocks. He only gave me Sunder's number, sir. You better make your stories a bit believable, girl. These silly stories will get you into trouble. This is not silly, sir. - What do you call it otherwise? Let's assume Sunder moved the divider blocks. You killed him for that. Am I right? Sir, I went to his place just to interview him. That's all. Is it a great feat to move divider blocks that you interview him? Sir, they stop their vehicles in the middle of the road... And displace the divider blocks with no care for the world. Ever wonder how their thinking must be? Civic Sense and Traffic Rules... Aren't they important? To analyze their mentalities, I wanted to interview them. Hello... Sir, we're investigating that case... You might be having political pressure... But we need time to take further action... Give us time until tomorrow morning. We'll do something about it. Nayak, come with me. - Sir... Saroja, you stay here. - Okay, sir. Sit down girl... Sit down. Kasi, get the car. Hey, put my bag in the vehicle. Nayak... It's already too late. Looks like it'll pour heavily tonight. Send her to the remand home immediately. Let's investigate her once we have the post-mortem report. Why a remand home, sir? Let's send her home. We could do that if this was any other case. But the victim Sunder is Corporate CI office worker. He handles all the Corporator's accounts. That is why everyone's giving us a hard time. Prabhakar, you do something. Collect the apartment's CCTV footage... And also get his entire calls data. - Okay sir. Have them ready by morning. - I'll do that, sir. I've been getting calls from home. I have to go. - Don't worry, sir. Come on... Why are you calling me on repeat? I told you I'm on my way. Just a minute, sir. I have nothing to do with this. I'm telling the truth, sir. - Ok... Okay. Nayak... - Sir... What do you think of what she said? I feel she's telling us the truth, sir. She went to Sunder's place and Sunder died around the same time. It might be coincidence sir... We can't be the judge of that... No matter what, this case can't go to CBCID. We have direct orders from the Minister. Okay? I'll see you in the morning. - Ok. Good night sir. Saroja... - Sir... Call the remand home and ask them to get the paperwork ready. She'll be staying there for the night. - Sir! - Sir, actually... Why should I stay there? At least you tell me, sir. - You sit down! You go... Sir, it's very late... It's too late already and it's pouring outside. I know. But there's nothing we can do. Go - Okay, sir. Sir, why are you doing this to me? I answered all your questions. - Sit. We have many more questions to ask you. Over the night by the rules, - Sir. - we can't have you here. If I was the reason behind his death... Why would I mention my original phone number and address in the register? Under the circumstances, you're a suspect. You better cooperate with us. There's been some misunderstanding, sir. I have 10 other addresses along with Sunder's. What do you mean? Take a look at this. Here are the addresses of those 10 people. Take a look. The old man on the flyover gave me all these addresses. All of them moved the divider block and took a U-turn. Sunder is just one of them. He's just one of them. Wait... Wait... Let's back up for a second. You mentioned an old man on the flyover... Who is he? Why is he feeding you numbers? Er... Every time I go there, he's there. If he notes the vehicle numbers for me... I promised to pay him 100 bucks. That is it, sir. So, he gave you these 10 numbers? Have you interviewed all of them? No sir. I went to interview Sunder first. The guy Rajesh's address was taken last month... I mean, why Sunder? It's.... - Tell me... Last month, my mom came to visit me. I couldn't make time to follow anyone. Could you show me the man if we go to the flyover? Of course, I can take you. He's always sitting at the flyover steps. Okay. Wait here. Sami... Sir, you asked for me? - Yes. Go to the police stations pertaining to these addresses. Find out if there are any complaints registered on these vehicles. Do it fast. - Okay, sir. Chakri... - Sir... Call the mortuary regarding Sunder's post-mortem report. Make it quick. - Okay, sir. Prabha... Sir... Take Rachana and go to the Velacheri flyover. She'll show you an old man over there. Just go bring him now. Sir... it's pouring heavily. Let's leave her in the remand home like sir said. Prabha, you know how a remand home is. Poor girl! Let's help her out. We don't have time. Make it fast. - Okay, sir. Narayana... - Sir.. Get the vehicle. - Ok sir. Let's go. Come on... TN 05 EA 2162 Can you name the cases registered on this vehicle number? I know you need time to write an official report, doctor. Doctor, quickly do as you're told. Kasi, stop the vehicle. Thank you, sir. Where is he? - Over there... Near the steps... Kashi, go look... Where is he? You said he'll be here. This is where I see him all the time, sir. Hello... Sir, we're here. There's nobody on the flyover. This girl has been lying since the beginning. Prabha, be more patient. Look around. Okay, sir. I'll check. Sir! Hey, stop. Did it seem like a suicide or a murder? Go... Go sit over there. Saroja... Sir... What is it, Prabha? - We found him, sir. Look... He's the man who helped her. Rachana, did he give you the numbers? Yes, sir. Prabha, take him to the interrogation room. - Let's go. - Rachana, you can go with him. What's the update, Chakri? Sir, I spoke to the duty doctor. According to what he said... There are no scratches or attacking marks on Sunder's body. Have they analyzed the time of death? Estimated death time is around 2 AM. But, they didn't confirm it. 2 am... Okay, Chakri. You may go. Thank you. Okay, sir. Chakri, get me a coffee. - Sure, sir Sir, according to the clues team report... Going by the apartment's CCTV footage... After Sunder's wife left home, she was the only girl who visited the house. So in between Sunder's time of death and Rachana's time of visit. Approxiamtely 12 hours gap... Correct sir. And... Do they have any connections? - That is what I don't get, sir. To claim Sunder and Rachana have a connection... We haven't found a single clue or evidence whatsoever. In that case, she's telling the truth, Prabha. She is innocent. What kind of story is this, sir? Some random guy takes a U-turn. This mad man notes his vehicle number. And this girl collects those numbers from him. Do we look like fools to the youngsters? Come in. Sir, in concern with the vehicle numbers you gave me... I've collected all the details from the police stations. Prabha, check these out. Hey! Get up! Sir, where are you taking him? - You sit down, girl. - Come on… - Take her… Sir, he’s innocent. Please, sir… Sit down... Sit down... Did he give you the ten vehicle numbers? Yes, sir. Have you shared these numbers with anyone else? No, sir. He gave you the numbers. Who gave you their addresses? Sir, one of my friends is working in RTO. I gave him the numbers and he shared the addresses. That's all. What happened, sir? The ten people in your diary are dead. They're all dead! Reports suggest all of them committed suicide. you're hiding something from me. I'm trying to help you out. Don't lie to me, damn it! I don't get what's happening here, sir. Except for these addresses and numbers... I don't know anything. What about the dates above the addresses? The dates... when they moved the divider blocks and took an u-turn... That's it, sir. The dates they committed suicide on... The dates mentioned in the police reports... The dates noted in your diary... Same dates in all the ten cases... How do you explain this? Look… The date Sunder died on and the date in your diary are the same. How do you justify this? He doesn't say a word no matter how hard we thrash him. He must be dumb. We can't possibly get any information from him. What do we do, sir? He's the only link, Prabha. I checked his pockets and found this notepad. There's a vehicle number noted in it. Rachana... Whose number is this? I don't know, sir. Rachana, look again and tell me whose number it is. It must be the vehicle number of the guy who moved the divider block today. He must've noted it to inform me. He usually gives it on my way to the office the next day. But I don't know what's happening sir... In case he gives you the information tomorrow... Do you mention the date in the diary? Which date do you mention? Today's date, sir. Prabha... Swami, get me a pen. Take it sir... Trace this vehicle's address and inform me right away. - Okay, sir. - Make it fast. Sure, sir. Chakri, open the cell. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir. - Try again. Why'd you put this mad man in my cell? Sir! Sir! - Can you see? I'm talking to you. - Why are you noting the numbers? Why are you noting these numbers? - Okay, Prabha. Come with me. Chakri, go handle him. - Okay, sir. Prabha, go to the traffic control room and check the vehicles that took a U-Turn. - Ok sir. Make it as soon as possible. - Sure sir. Sir... The vehicle number address you asked for is nearby. Get the car. - Okay, sir. Rachana, please come. I've fallen sick, sir. Shall I go home? No. Please stay here. Did Swami go? Yes sir. Sir, do you want me to come? - No need. Come, Rachana... Call me if it's anything urgent. - Okay, sir. Drive... Who's Malik here? - That's him, sir. Ok. Malik... Yes, sir? Tell me. Nayak asked me to meet you. Yeah. He called me. What information do you need? Malik... - Yeah? Could you tell me if this vehicle took a u-turn on velacheri flyover? Sure. I'll check and let you know. You please be seated. Thank you. Rachana... Flat number? - 1504, sir... Mr. Swami... - Sir. Why did you knock so many times? You see the board? Sorry, sir. I didn't see. Who are you here for? Are you Mr. Sarath Kumar? Who was it? Who rang the door bell? Baby was asleep. You woke her up. Don't you have any sense? Look how the baby's crying. Is that your vehicle downstairs? TN 21 BC 2120... Why should I answer you? What's the matter? He asked if that was your vehicle. Yes. So what? Have you ever seen her before? Who is she? Who is she? Rachana... Have you ever seen him before? No, sir. Have you taken a U-turn on Velachri flyover? Why? Did somebody complain? Did she file a complaint? What did the complaint say? What happened? Any problem? - It's nothing. You go inside and sleep. Go! - Okay. Who else is home? Why do you care about that? What's the complaint about? Have you got a warrant? Hello... I'm an advocate. You can't talk to me the way you do with everyone else. Have you got a warrant? Hello... Hello... Hey! I'm talking to you. Where are you going? Do you have a search warrant? Who is she? Can't you hear me? Ask him to come out first. I'm talking to you. Hello... I'm talking to you. Hey! I'm talking to you. Don't you undrstand? Come out! I'm sorry. Hello! Hey! What are you doing in there? Come out. Did you find anything, huh? Come to the station tomorrow. Let's file a complaint. Shut the door and stay safe. Come, Rachana... Yeah, sure. I'll come tomorrow morning. I'll file a case on you and put you in the court room. I'll show you the power of an advocate tomorrow. Hey... - Sir... Do something. Stay here till morning... - Sir... Here? Yeah. Any problem? Er... Nothing, sir. Call me if anything urgent. - No problem sir. Just for precaution... Why'd they come at this hour? It's nothing. Go to sleep. Hey! shut her mouth. Sit in the front. A police's life has become piteous. Damn! Prabha... The vehicle you mentioned took a U-turn, sir. It's captured in the cameras on the flyover. Is he an advocate? - Yes, sir. The guy in the driver's seat was wearing a lawyer's coat. Have you cross checked all the vehicle numbers in the diary? We are working on it, sir. It'll take some time. Okay. Keep me posted. Sure, sir. Malik, let's check the other numbers as well. This advocate took a U-turn on the flyover. It's recorded in the CCTV footage. The old man noted his number to inform you. The u-turn, Sunder's death and the remaining deaths... I'm sure there's some kind of a connect. Rachana, is there anything you've missed? Just try to remember. I told you everything, sir. Oh, shit! Don't come out. Sarath! Sir... Sir... Huh? Did you find all the details? - Yes, sir. We did. The remaining numbers in the diary? - We've got all the details, sir. Here is the printout. Okay, thank you. - Thank you, sir. I was occupied with Minister's case and this happened. No, sir. Listen to me. Yes sir... It's a complicated situation. Morning, sir... In your Jurisdiction, an advocate fell on our station vehicle and died. It's not that easy... I need some time. Please delay the lawyer's press conference. Please do it for my sake. Okay sir. Thank you. What have I told you and what have you done? Sir, I am investigating. I told you to send her to the remand home. Yes, sir. But the case... - Nayak... I've been embarrassed in front of the Commissioner and Press because of you. Sir, Rachana had 10 other vehicle numbers along with Sunder's. What does that have anything to do with following my orders? Sir, all the 10 vehicles took a U-turn on the flyover. Look at this. And all the ten are dead. What are you saying, Nayak? - Yes, sir. Every case was closed considering it an apparent suicide. Sir, I think we need to further enquire on this. Do you think the girl did all of this? No way, sir. I enquired the girl the whole night. And she's nowhere connected to this. I think she is innocent, sir. Hmm... Look at this. Sunder's post-mortem report... Clear suicide... Close the case now. There is something fishy, sir. With your permission, I'll carry out further investigation. No, Nayak. Don't do anything. Just close Sunder's case. That's enough. The other cases are not linked to our station anyways. Forget it. So, where's the girl? She's in the interrogation room. Let's go. Call her. Rachana... Rachana... Rachana...! Come... We're enquiring your friend from RTO. Don't worry. He's not in trouble. We got the post-mortem report. To prove Sunder was murdered with your involvement... We've got no evidence in hand. You may go. You're free to go now. If these vehicle numbers and addresses leaks... If this news leaks... Your life will become hell. I'm saying this for your own good. Forget everything right here. Do you understand? Nayak... - Sir... Drop her home. Yes, sir. We have the post-mortem report, sir. We're closing the case as it's a suicide. Yes sir... Tell your corporate friend... He's not in trouble. Okay, sir. Thank you. Rachana... Rachana... We reached your home. Sir... You must be really tired. Go and rest. At least do you believe me? - I trust you Rachana... I'll make sure you have no issues regarding this case. Don't worry. - Thank you. Prabha... I sent you a message. What happened to the reports that I asked you for? Yeah. Send them to my table. Go fast. We've been waiting for a really long time now. Have you seen all the post-mortem reports? We have prepared them ourselves, sir. No, I mean... All the reports state suicide. Sir, we reported the cause of death. But, the police should decide if it's suicide or murder. I was actually looking for a common link in all these cases. Maybe... The time of death or weapons used or the wounds inflicted... Anything unique or.... Unusual. In the cases I handled, I haven't found anything strange, sir. Even I didn't notice anything fishy, sir. It's 100 percent suicide. - Sir... Kumar, please come. Sir, Mr. Prabhakar sent these papers for you. Ok... Thank you. - Thank you sir. You can leave now. If there's anything, I'll give you a call. And, thanks for your cooperation. Welcome sir. - Thank you, sir. Hey, hi... This is Rachana's desk, right? - Yes. But she hasn't come yet. Oh... Okay, thanks. Hey, Rachana... Hi... I was looking for you. How come you're late today? All okay? Umm... No. What's wrong, Rachana? I slept late last night. Hmm... Coffee? It's the editor... Okay, no problem. You carry on. We'll talk later... - Ok. Bye. Excuse me, sir... Are you busy? It's ok. Tell me. Sir, I handled one of the cases. It seemed unusual to me. Please come. - Thank you sir. Sir, can I see the report once? This one? Not that one, sir. This one... Yes, t his is the report I filed, sir. In this particular case, death was caused by the slit of wrist vein. Normally they only make one slit. In very rare case they will slit 2 or 3 times... But in this particular case, the cut was curve shaped. Look... Umm... Isn't that common? No, sir. People prone to suicide are usually depressed. They use a blade or a knife to cut at one go. That's normal. They wouldn't curve the blade in a... Er... How do I explain? Umm... In a 'u' shape? - Yes. Yes sir, that seemed strange to me. Okay, sir. I came back to tell you about this. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir. It's purely coincidental. I've already released a statement to the Press. I have nothing else to add. Please... Thank you. Sir, actually... - Nayak... This case was supposed to be closed simply. You complicated it unnecessarily. When an advocate falls on to a police jeep and dies... What does that mean? It's a national level breaking news, you know? Sir, I went there to save him. I didn't... - Nayak! Don't say this out in the public. The advocate's wife gave a statement. 'The advocate took debts from several loan sharks' 'Knowing his house and property will be seized...' 'He jumped off a building to avoid the consequences.' Sir? This is what you should tell everyone. - Sir, no... Got it? Yes, sir. What's that? Sir, didn't I tell you already? Sunder's case and the U-turn case have a common link. I just wanted to show you... - Nayak! We discussed this already. Sunder's case is closed. There are no U-turn cases. Go... There are many cases pending. Go deal with them. - Yes, sir. Nayak... Do you have Rachana's contact? Yes, sir. If you could talk to her... - First... Delete it. Go. Yes, sir. Brother... Brother... Sorry. I didn't expect for this to happen. Keep this. Take it. Hello... Hello... Can you hear me? - Are you okay? Is there a problem? - No... No... Nothing like that. It's just work stress. Rachana... Tell me something honestly. Yeah? After I dropped you last night, did I say something wrong? No... No, Aditya. You're just really thinking too much. How about dinner? Shall we meet if you're free? Aditya, I'll just call you back. Hello... Hello, Rachana! Hello... He doesn't know anything, sir. He's a really good guy. His friends influence him. You never listened to me. Look we ended up in a police station finally. Sir... Sir, please... You have to save them both. Please come fast. Ask Prabhakar to attend them. Let's go. Come out. What happened? Sir, actually, I was on the Velicheri flyover a while ago. And then... 'Aditya, I'll just call you back.' You're struggling to move one block. It's damn heavy, man. Sir, sir stop! You're not supposed to take a u-turn here. Please go straight. As if you can speak... You can't speak Tamil? Keep watching... Yes, sir. Sir, You can't take a U turn here, it's wrong. What? Wrong? Who are you to tell me? Sir, it's not right. Who are you to tell me what's right and wrong? She is like a Traffic Priest, dude. What the hell is an Traffic Priest? You know... They stand at the signals and preach morals to the public. You'll have a problem if you take a u-turn here. Problem? What problem, huh? You can't take a u-turn here. I won't allow you, sir. Do you own the flyover that you won't allow us? - Dude... Dude, you will scare her... - Ya she'll get scared... Fine, We'll not take a u-turn. We'll go straight... Will you join us? Hello! Get the hell out of here! Go teach kids about all your rules. Not us. She looks damn hot even when she's angry, bro. Hey, she's not our type. Hey.. . Care to join us? Bro, she's clicking our picture. Really? Post it on Facebook. You'll get likes. Sir, you have to save them at any cost. Please... Here, sir... I took a picture of their vehicle number. Why are you interfering in these issues? Sir... What are you saying, sir? Whoever takes a u-turn on the flyover gets killed accordingly. Even they will... Do you think you're some detective or from CID? I told you already. If you get into this mess, you'll be in trouble. I didn't do anything, sir. Those guys ignored my warning and took a u-turn and left. Sir, please... You have to save them. Please... It's not our duty to watch people pass by on the flyover. Get out! Go. Go advise your friend. - Sir. Rachana... Rachana... Don't be angry, Rachana. I'm saying this for your own good. How can you not care about this? Their lives are in danger, sir. They'll be fine, Rachana. Believe me. Sir, the advocate fell on the jeep and died while you were watching. Having witnessed that, how could you still say this? I also have to follow my senior's orders, Rachana. Try to understand. Okay, sir. You follow your senior's orders. But if something happens to them tomorrow... I'm not going to stay silent. Drive... Shame on your part! Instead of taking drugs and lying down like a dead person... Why don't you take your own life? Dude... Raju, wake up. You had marijuana without telling me, didn't you? My bad fate! You bloody scoundrel! Sir... He's looking at us, trying to tell us something. Do you get it? Sir, what place is this? It's safe, right? It's the old cell in the basement. There's nothing to worry. They're safe out there. They'll be staying there for the night. Kumar... - Sir... Go turn the lights off. They'll go to sleep. - Okay, sir. Rachana... - Hmm? Have it. - No sir. - It's okay. Please have it. Thank you for believing in me. Thanks for bringing them to a safe place. It's my duty, Rachana. Moreover, after the advocate's case... I don't want to take any chances. Sir, is there any progress in the advocate's death case? Investigation is still going on. He had a lot of debts and he'd be in fear all the time. This was his wife's statement. Do the u-turn and all these deaths hold a connection? Investigation is going on... It will take some time. - Sir... Sir... Sir... Please come urgently. What is it now? Hold this. - Sir... Give me that, ma'am. Sir... Look, sir... Sir... He stood up suddenly a while ago. Since then, he's been walking back and forth. I'm really scared. What do you want us to do, sir? Kumar... Turn the lights on. Sir. Umm... Call Chakri. Sure, sir. Hey, Raju! Why are you hitting me? Sir, you asked for me? Chakri, they're having a brawl. Go control them. - Okay, sir. - Go fast. What's wrong with you? Hey, Raju! Sir, why are they fighting? No! I'm warning you not to do it. No! Sir, these key are useless... I can't open it... Come in... Sir, Did you get another pair of keys? I can't open the lock with these. Look... - Give him the keys, sir. What's all this, sir? What's happening? You stay here. I'll go check and come. You don't have to go, sir. I'll handle it. Are you sure? - Sure sir. How dare you! Prabha, do something and stop them now. Sir. Do it fast! What happened? - Door is not opening... Open it quick! - I'm trying... Don't do it. What are you looking at? Break it down! Sir. Sir. Help! Sir help! Can you hear me? Sir. Sir, the door is jammed. We can't open it no matter what. Sir, please help me. Sir. Leave me! Sir...! Sir! Rachana, you stay right here. I'll be back. Prabha move... Break the door. Just move! - Yes sir. Ok sir. Chakri, open quickly... Come, come open it quick! Come on hurry up! Come on... fast! Kumar make it quick! Sir, we tried many keys but we can't open the door. What is this sir? we can't open the door. Prabha, give me the walkie. Rachana can you hear me? Come in. Can you hear me? Rachana reaspond! Can you hear me? Hello... Hello sir. Rachana can you hear me? Sir, he is looking at me... I'm scared! Rachana come again! Sir! Sir! Sir please save me... - How long will it take? Sir, save me... Quick! Hold on... - Sir move... move. Just hold on. - Sir, save me... Make it fast. Prabha quick! Shit! Leave... Chakri leave... Leave. Sir, please save me... Prabha...!! Quick! Leave him... Hey! Leave him! Sir, what's happening? Prabha quick!! What do we do? What's wrong? - I don't know sir... Prabha... Prabha... speak! Sir! Sir this door is open. Sir the lock is open. What's taking so long? Open the gate... I'm trying sir... Open the gate... Open! When will this door open? Sir it's not opening sir... Sir... I'm very scared... Sir, let's go... I'm very scared... - Shut up Shut your mouth! Let's leave sir. Let's leave this place. There is something here... Sir, please listen to me... Sir quick... let's leave... Sir quick! Sir! Sir! - Let's go - Prabha! Sir! - Sir! Sir... quick! Sir there is something inside.. Sir, listen to me. Don't go sir... Please listen to me... No sir... Don't go close... Don't go close... No sir... I'm really scared... Don't go sir.... Careful! - Sir... Prabha... - Sir! Sir! Listen to me... Leave! Hi... I tried calling you but you didn't respond... Rachana... Guys... - Sir? Can you please...? - Okay, sir. Thanks. Rachana... Hey... What happened? What happened, huh? It's okay. I'm sorry, Aditya. Why? I haven't been myself for the past few days.. Since three days... You were fine the first day. Rachana, you're hiding something from me. I'll not ask you about it. When you feel like it's time, I know you'll tell me. But... I'm really worried about you. Is someone bothering you? Are you okay? No, I'm fine... No one's bothering me. It's just work pressure. That's all. Okay, forget all that. To relieve all your work pressure, I have a gift for you. Take it. You asked for details regarding the accidents on Velacheri flyover. To develop your story... There are a few details in these... If this is of any help to you, I'll be happy. Ugh! I've got to take this, Rachana I've got to go. Work call... Sorry. You take care, okay? Yeah, hello... I'll mail you in two minutes. Yeah, okay. Pause. Play camera 2 now. Hey! Hey! Sir... He fought right in front of you and shot himself to death with your gun. Three people died in a span of just two days. And they died in front of cops. I warned you yesterday itself... You don't follow senior’s orders? Have you got no respect for seniors? I’m sorry, sir. But, something is happening here. These three cases are linked, sir. Stop it, Nayak! Three people died... and there's only one interconnection. One, it’s you. Two, your friend, Rachana... What were you guys doing? Were you watching the show? There’s an enquiry commission on three of you as well. It's not their fault, sir. I take the responsibility. Sir. Hmm... Go. - Yes, sir. Until the enquiry is complete, You are under suspension. Yes? Ritesh... Yes... Tell me. I’m Rachana... I work for Times of India. I need to speak with you. Regarding? I’m writing a story about the accidents on Velacheri flyover... - Ok. I have a few questions to ask you. Maya and I fell in love and got married. Arna was my daughter's name. She was in second grade. My wife was a working woman. I had to come home from work every evening... Play with Arna, talk with her and feed her. It was going great. Arna was both our life and world... Our life... Was a joyous one. I’m sorry, sir. That day was Arna’s friend’s birthday. I told my wife to hire an auto or take our car. But, Arna wants bike... She wanted to go on a bike... Sir, what do you think about this accident? What do you think happened? Police closed the case stating it was rash driving. Maya would drive real safe. I know. But on the night of the accident... A car passed by on that flyover... That car caused the accident. The car was recorded in the traffic cameras. But police... Didn’t hold an investigation. In just one night... One night, I lost my whole family. I’m really sorry... I shouldn’t have reminded you of all this. They are dead... but I still don't know who did it. Hi, Rachana... I found out when I went to the station. I’m sorry. Your job is at stakes because of me. Nothing like that. The case is still going on and it’ll be fine. But still I feel guilty. Don't worry, It’s just temporary... Why did that happen last night? Case report suggests he was on drugs. Maybe that is why he reacted like that. Sir, I met the families of victims injured on the flyover. You are still hanging on the flyover incident? Sir... Sir, I met a guy Ritesh. His wife and daughter died on the flyover. He lives alone.I feel there’s something very strange about him. I think you should investigate further. Rachana, can you just stop it? You’re being really absurd about this case. just let go of it. Sir, all these deaths are linked. You know that. Those 10 deaths, Sunder’s death and the biker’s brawl... You’re the prime suspect in all of them. I didn’t do anything, sir. I know, Rachana. Everyone else should know too. This will be a problem to you. You’d have to attend the police stations and courts for years. Sir, everyone who takes a U-turn on the flyover is dying. And you’re saying we should do nothing about that? Rachana, I’ve witnessed several murders in my career... I’ve learnt one thing from them... I think you should also follow that. Hello, Prabha... Few questions are better not asked. Then you wouldn’t have the guilt of not finding the answers. And I’m done with this case, Rachana. I can’t help you anymore. Sir... The complete file regarding the u-turn. I appreciate it, Prabha. I know you ae doing the right thing, sir. Thanks for believing in me. Hello... Rachu, why'd you call at this hour? What's wrong? I can't call? - When did you call? We call you all the time. Stop being so dramatic, mom. Had your dinner? Long back... Did you eat? How's dad doing? How come you thought of us tonight? Just answer me. Or else, I'll hang up. Dad is fine. I'm fine. And so is the dog. Mom, I'm really scared. Rachu, you're fine, right? Do you want me to come there? No... I just wanted to talk to you. That is why I called. This is why I ask you to get married... Then you will have a guy beside you. You wouldn't have to call me when you are scared. Actually, there's a guy at work. I'll come there tomorrow itself. Share his parent's phone numbers with me. I'll talk to them right away. - Mom... Mom... Things didn't go that far... I like him... I wonder if he... How could he say no to a girl like you? It's just that you're a bit short tempered. You don't get along with elders. And you don't believe in God. - Mom, mom stop it! I'm out of my mind to have called you. Bye, good night. - Hey, Rachu! Arna... No Mom... Eat it... - No. Stop playing... Please... You didn't eat anything from last evening. Mom, I don't want an apple. I want an orange. You don't get oranges here. Eat this. I don't want it. - It's good for your body. Eat it... I don't want now mom... Have it. Just one piece... It tastes bad, mom. I don't want it. Just one piece, dear... No, mom. - Mom will be angry if you say no. Please mom... Where's the balloon? It must be somewhere around. Go look for it. - Ok mom. You always play with balloon.... You should come back and finish it. Okay, mom. - Careful, Arna. You're responsible for my daughter's death, right? It's not me. You only moved the divider block on the flyover today. Why did you do it? I don't know anything... One... Two... Jump. Why did you kill my daughter? I didn't kill her. Don't lie to me. It's true that I moved the divider block to find out what's happening there. But, on the day of the accident, I didn't move the divider block. Everyone is saying the same thing. That night, Arna and I were driving slow on the flyover. Arna are you feeling sleepy, sweetheart? No, mom. Because you moved the block, we crashed. I didn't move it. I don't know what happened later... Looks like she lost a lot of blood. No one noticed them until long after the accident, ma'am. I was told there was a little girl. Where is she? We've received numerous complaints about accidents on this flyover, sir. Send the body for post-mortem. She's a little girl, ma'am. Poor one! Bye mom. Arna... Mom... My sweetheart... She was five years old. She doesn't even know what death means. Her birthday was in 2 months... We were waiting for... - Mom... Are you crying, mom? Hey! Why are you making mom cry? No... No... Auntie didn't do anything, love. I got something in my eye. That's all. Mom, will you read me a story? Ok... You go to sleep first. I'll read you a story. - Okay, mom. Good night, Arna. - Good night, mom. Please... I didn't do anything Please leave me. Please... Please... Please leave me. I didn't do anything. I'll find out who moved the divider block and took a u-turn. I'll find out and tell you... Please believe me. Please... Ok... I'm giving you a chance. By tomorrow, I should know who killed my daughter. For a week, if we investigate at the ground... Sorry. Just a second... Hello, Aditya... I'm in a meeting. I'll call you later. Aditya...! - Let me call you back. I can't talk right now. Okay? 'I giving you a chance.' 'By tomorrow, I should know who killed my daughter.' I saw it.. Rachana! I saw her cut the apple for her daughter. Enough already! Listen, I'm serious... You'll have to stop thinking about this. No... No... No sir. We need to find out who moved the divider block. Please... - Just listen to me. - Sir! Will you help me or not? If not, forget it. I'll take care. Did you eat anything? Come, sit... Eat something first. Don't worry. We'll sort this out. Krishna, I'll go freshen up while you eat. When you don't believe me, why are you doing all this, sir? This material has the 10 names in your diary and their photos All of these have a common link. All the cases have a 'u' shape reference. Sunder's case, Srinivas's case and the advocate's case... The guys who died in the cell the other night... Just look at this. And it's not a coincidence. Rachana... Rachana, did you see anything like this last night? I don't remember, sir. No. Think about it. Any kind of pattern, object... Something related to this? I didn't notice any such thing, sir. Okay. Let's go. Hi, Malik... - Oh... Hello, sir... How come you're here all of a sudden? Anything urgent? Nothing, Malik. There was an accident on Velachery flyover on March 9th. I need to see that footage. - Yes, sir. Just a minute... Make it fast, please. Sir... By any chance, is it of a mother and a child? Yes, sir. The girl fell on the railway track from her car. It's that case. - Sorry sir. Sorry, sir. Up until then, there were no cameras on the flyover. Aren't there any cameras? Post accident, the cameras were fixed. Sir, the accident occurred because the divider block was moved. We need to find out who moved it. Like I told you, there are no cameras, ma'am. How will we find out? Are there cameras at the flyover's entry and exit? Yes, sir. - Can you play the footage? This is the March 9th flyover traffic footage, sir. Can you give me the vehicle number? We can check if it passed by the flyover. That's what we need to find out. It's really hard to find if you don't have the vehicle number. If someone enters the flyover and returns immediately... It means they've taken the wrong u-turn, correct? - Yes, sir. That's the only possibility. Once you get on the flyover, you'll need a minimum of 15 minutes to return. So, the first one to return have moved the blocks. Am I right? You're right, sir. If we check the flyover entry footage, we can find out who moved the block. - Malik Can I see that footage? Sure. I'll play it right now, sir. Sir, on this side of the screen, you can see the traffic going towards the flyover. The first one to move the block and take a u-turn will be seen on both sides of the screen. That's good, Malik. Just play the footage now. You also watch closely, sir. Let me know if you notice anything. Sir... Sir... Sir...! That red jacket... Rewind a little. Right there. Pause it, Malik. It looks like him sir. There's no chance he'd exit so quickly without taking a u-turn. Malik, trace that vehicle number. I want all the information fast. - Ok sir. Rachana, you wait outside I'll come. Sir, the bike doesn't have a number plate in the front. Look... - We got the back number plate, right? Zoom in to that. - I'm on it, sir. Rachana... the vehicle number and the address... What happened? Is everything okay? Rachana! Hey, Rachana! Mom, balloon... Hello... Hello, Ramesh... - No, this is his brother. Who's this? Wait. Rachana? Is that you? Why did you call my brother's phone? How did you get this number anyways? Hello... Hello, Rachana... Are you there? Is this your brother's number? - Yeah. He shifted to US before 2 years. He asked me to keep the number as it's lucky for him. But, how did you get this number? Rachana... Hello... 'My brother's bike... I'm just using it.' 'I take the Velichery flyover route every day.' Malik... - Sir... What happened? I've got something to show you. - Why? What happened? Rachana, you're acting strange. What's happening? Where are you? You killed her, Aditya. What?! You moved the block on Velachery flyover and took a u-turn. That kid died because of you. You killed her. Which accident? Which girl? What are you talking about? You passed by the flyover in a red jacket on your brother's bike. I saw it on the traffic cameras. never thought it'd be you. - Listen, I take that flyover every day. But I've never moved a divider block. Sir, this vehicle went on the flyover. Yeah. The guy in the red jacket... And this is the vehicle in the opposite lane after a minute. Have you seen me move the divider block? I didn't but... - Then? You just assumed. Is that right? Do you know what happened that day? The vehicle that entered and the exited are different. How is it possible! I had to give my brother's bike for servicing. I didn't have the time to take it to the garage. And the mechanic was my friend. So, both of us met on the flyover. When I checked the other side's footage on the flyover...I noticed this. It's the same vehicle, same color and same model. But, the registration number is different. Bala, I think the engine is broken. Fix it. I'll collect the bike tomorrow. - Okay! We just exchanged our bikes. He took my bike and I returned on his bike. This was what happened. So, you didn't move the divider block? No, Rachana. I'm not the kind who'd take u-turns in shortcuts. Trust me. 'By tomorrow, you should find out who killed my daughter.' Sir... Sir... Sir...! That red jacket... Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Hello... Rachana, are you there? - Oh, my god! Aditya, where are you? - I'm in my flat. Why? Just hold on one second, Rachana. Hold on... Aditya! Aditya, don't go! Aditya! Aditya, don't go! Aditya! Who is it? Auto... Auto... Brother, drive to Velacheryi quickly. Hello... Hello, Rachana... Hello... Hello... Hello... - Rachana... The address I gave you is wrong. There's something wrong in it. The red jacket guy didn't move the block. Sir, I know it's not him. - How do you know? The red jacket guy is my friend. He works in my office. That's strange. - Sir, I really need your help. What's wrong, Rachana? Where are you? Sir, I know you'll not believe me. But my friend's life is in danger. She'll kill him, sir. I really need your help. Tell me. What do I have to do? Go fast. Umm... Ritesh... Yes! Who is it? Brother, turn left here. Hello... Who's there? Who is it? Rachana, Ritesh is with me. We are also headed there. Bye. Can you tell me what's happening? The day your wife and daughter died... A biker moved the divider blocks on the flyover. What are you saying, sir? Because the biker moved the blocks and left them in the middle of the road.. We assume your wife and daughter met with an accident. This is just a speculation, Ritesh. Hello... Tell me, Malik. Sir... I found the number of the guy who moved the block and took a u-turn. It's him? Are you sure? Yes, sir. 100 percent. Forward me his name and address details. I'll do it right now, sir. - Ritesh... I think we got him. Ritesh, come... Which floor? - 13th Ritesh... I saw your wife and daughter at my place last night. Aditya! Aditya! Sir... Aditya! Ritesh.
