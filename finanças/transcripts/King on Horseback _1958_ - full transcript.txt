Once upon a time, during the reign of Louis the Beloved, a French army was camped in a German town called Dreimahl. Their famous allies included the Prussians and their king Frederick, a man who spoke French without an accent. Despite appearances, this time we were not fighting for the King of Prussia but for the Prince-elector of Bavaria, Charles Albert. Why were we fighting? Over an obscure succession matter. But mostly to wage war. At that time, a year without war was a year without sunshine. HONOR TO THE KING That day, the French, Prussians, and Bavarians were parading in honor of King Louis XV whom we were expecting at any minute. His very Christian Majesty came to congratulate his troops and their leader, Noailles, the world's greatest marshal, for a victory won the day before. A victory known by French schoolchildren as the French Victory of Dreimahl. Thank you. "Sire, your troops' morale is in harmony with its leaders." "Well done. Victory is near. Very well done." "Your enemies lack troops and equipment, food and ammunition, and defeatism reigns in Empress Maria Theresa of Austria's camp. Bravo." Opposite, in the plains, the Austrian Army was encamped with arms drawn. To wage war against the Prussians and Bavarians, the Austrians had the best reasons in the world: the same language, the same race, and the same taste for foamy beer. It's leader, a graceful valkyrie, the Empress Maria Theresa. Their English allies did not ask why they were fighting. And the Turks were ready to die with gusto - for the Holy Roman- - German Empire in the name of Allah. That day, like those across from them, the Austrians, English, and Turks were celebrating my victory won the day before. A victory known by Austrian schoolchildren as the Austrian Victory of Dreimahl. And now, on to the theater. The Little Theater of the King's Armies. Heya! Another move like that and we'll edge them out. Heya! Musket loaded! Oh, a thing like that makes more noise than it does harm. I think we could defend ourselves with it. Uncle! We're almost to the battlefields. Mamma mia, I can already hear the sound of cannons. Shut up, Bravaccio! The slightest emotion could kill me. - I have a heart murmur. - We're all going to die. Nothing like a bottle of wine to help me recover. Bunch of cowards. All is calm in my beautiful Baden countryside. You lost. Surrender! Never! I'll kill the first man who touches me with this pistol. And I'll kill myself with this one. Then, it's time to die. Whoa! - You saved my life, sir. - It's the least I could do. My people ran away like rabbits when they saw the Turks. They are cowards. - So you speak Italian? - Neapolitan. - I’m the countess of Amalfi. - Your Excellency. - Thank you. - Thank you, Your Excellency. Hey, heroic Bravaccio, ask the lady where we're dropping her off. - I'm going to Dreimahl. - Come, that's our destination. Come on, let's go! Let's go! DREIMAHL ALLIED HEADQUARTERS The king! The king! The king! Gather! HONOR TO THE KING Attention! Attention! Perfect order, Marshal. The king will be happy. It's a shame being gout-ridden on a day like this. It's infantrymen who fight wars on their feet, not marshals. Nor electors. Isn't that so, Your Highness? Present arms! Present arms! HONOR TO THE KING Please accept my regards, Monseigneur. What a strange crew, Countess. These actors saved my life. Ah, another victory. You hear that? This time it's the king! Her Majesty will think he's in a carnival. Poor me, I'm dishonored. But Marshal, these are times of war. Gentlemen, the king! Well, Malvina. It seems you escaped the Turks? I was nearly taken to Constantinople. You would have been the flower of the sultan's harem. - Like you are the flower of-- - The royal harem. You can say it. This way! The Little Theater of the King's Armies welcomes the company! If you want to see mountains and wonders. The moon in broad daylight, the sun at midnight. If you want to laugh until you cry and chuckle like geese. See policemen spanked and the bourgeois tossed around. Come to the Esplanade this evening, at eight o'clock, with a pistole. - A thaler. - A ducat. - A sequin. - Or pagan money. Any money will do. You'll see the pretty Rosita, high-rope dancer in Calcutta and at the Grand Theater in Bregenz. The funniest Harlequins. Pierrot and his antics! The beautiful Mirabelle, favorite of all the Tsars of Russia! An excellent Punchinello, your servant at your service. And a charming weakling, the so-called Needle. And finally, La Tour, rhymer and troubadour. The bravest of all songwriters, who wields a cape as well as a sword. Long live the king! Without these actors, you wouldn't have had the pleasure or displeasure of seeing me. The pleasure, Malvina. And you risked a thousand deaths to join me. I adore you. François, let me introduce you. I present to you my cousin Marmande, lieutenant-colonel of my cavalry regiment. - A real hero. - You exaggerate. Hardly! You're showered in glory, while I follow the Court at Versailles or Metz. To each his own conquest. I'm very happy to serve my king and the head of my family. I'm very happy with you, François. I've decided to show you how much. - Did Pérouge say anything? - No. Go see him. He will give you a little surprise from me. You bring me joy. - Pretty woman. - But expensive. The duke has cared for her for a year. It's costing him more than the entire regiment. He gave you something for me? Yes, a purse of ten thousand pounds. A tip? Attention! Pass me your spyglass, Marshal. Oh, excuse me. My cavalry's flag? What does it mean? Sire, it's an unfortunate coincidence. We must have lost it yesterday in battle. - Lost my standard? - Yes, Sire. Maria Theresa will die of laughter. I'm dying with rage. Colonel, what do you make of the cavalry - of the Guard of Saint- - Sever? - I didn't go to the battle, Sire... - You should have. I appreciate your company, but there are times you don't belong by my side. Being France's first blade is great, but you have to use it outside of Versailles. The standard will be back tomorrow or the cavalry will be no more. I'm counting on it, sir. There you go. He's going to bring back the flag I let them capture. - Shame for me. - Honor for him. As for you, Marshal, I relieve you of your command. Am I a disgrace, Sire? Judge for yourself. I appoint you Director of the School of War. Look at that La Tour fellow. What a handsome man. This noise is obnoxious. Marmande, tell Maria Theresa to be quiet. I didn't expect so much art from traveling actors. Only the men are dancing. I find the women to be very talented. Bravo! The King of France asks his cousin Maria Theresa to stop her cannons for two hours. They are a disturbance to the theatrical performance. His Majesty the King of France - asks his cousin Marie- - Thérèse to stop the cannon fire after two hours. I have enough! A victory here a defeat there. A victory there, a defeat here. This can't go on much longer. Your Majesty, everyone is exhausted. Let's make peace. Peace? No, ceasefire. We will rest and then continue the war. But with a young general and new allies. Tell the gunners to go to sleep. Yes, Your Majesty. Of course, the French are amused. I've had enough. My next allies will be the French. Paris. Jolly Paris. - Isn't that so? - Yes, Your Majesty. All animals end up in armies Who gets killed? Châteauroux! Châteauroux! Châteauroux! Châteauroux! Noailles! Noailles! Noailles! Noailles! - And Saint- - Sever! - Saint-Sever! Saint- - Sever! - Saint-Sever! Saint- - Sever! Sire... Sire, punish this hooligan as he deserves. Right away. Don't make that face Philippe. After all, it was just an opportunity to laugh. I'll shove laughter down that mutt's throat. Sire, please forgive me. For what? Telling the truth? Actor, what is your name? La Tour, Sire. You will go far. You have as much wit as you do courage. Bravaccio, he was perfect. - The king? - No, La Tour. I'll leave you for a moment. A walk will do me good. It's excellent for your health. See you soon. I'm going to dream of the stars alone. The stars of the troupe. Rising stars, who, unlike you, don't have the privilege of coming back every night. You know, nothing scares me in life, but you went too hard tonight. Careful, big guy, he could cook you up. The king is with me. But Châteauroux is against you. And you know women are always right. Good boy. Pérouge. Punish this funnyman like he deserves. Consider it done, Duke. Well, don't just stand there. Who are you? The king. - I've heard that many times. - But this time, it's true. Sire. Sire, for a king you're not too bad. And for an actress, you're better up close than from afar. Not too close. If you want me to step aside, just say the word. Stay. Two steps forward, march! Turn to the right, right! Ramrods out! You have no right to treat a man like this. I'll get even. If you want to die, don't be shy. It's shameful. Yes, it doesn't look very graceful to me. Then, do something. The duke is within his rights. The king can't help. Then, what can he do? Be proud to have subjects like mr. La Tour. I like when you speak like that. THE LITTLE THEATER OF THE KING'S ARMIES PRESENTS THE RUINED ARMY STARRING FAMOUS TROUBADOUR LA TOUR Riquet! Yes. - Where are you going? - Wherever I want. - Don't be silly, Riquet. Stay. - -No, I have to get even with Saint- - Sever. - Like this, in the middle of the night? - It's now or never. But think about it! He has guards and hired killers. Before you even get to his bed, you'll be larded like beef stew. You think I'm cowardly enough - to kill Saint- - Sever in his bed? Then, where are you going? To the other side of the wall with the Austrians. - You're going to join the enemy? - No, you fool. I'm just visiting Maria Theresa tonight in her tent. Do you want to win the Empress's heart? No, not her heart. Her flag. - Well... Saint- - Sever's flag. I will bring it back to the king, by cutting the grass under the noble duke's feet. Not a bad idea, huh? Seriously, you're not on Pont Neuf playing Matamor with theater soldiers. It's a real army! You don't stand a chance of making it back. Don't worry about it. I have a plan. - I coming with you, Riquet. - No, I'm going alone. Together, we'll be killed. Farewell, old friend. Riquet... Riquet! What is this? IN CASE OF MISFORTUNE, I LEAVE ALL MY MONEY TO THE TROUPE. I LEAVE MY COSTUMES, MAKEUP, AND PERSONAL EFFECTS TO PIERROT. Halt! Sergeant. Didn't you hear me? Come see. I don't have any orders. Let him run. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Enemy! Get up! Get up! Fire! Get back! What is this? An attack? No, fire, Your Majesty. Attack! Damn it... Jesus, I can forget about my vacation tomorrow. I'm tired of it. Hopefully there will be peace soon. Guard! A soldier in my bed! A soldier! Schwarzenbach! Lord, we are at your command. Sire, in a few hours, those of us who are alive will place your standard at your feet. Sire, I have avenged you. You have as much courage as you do wit. My poor cousin will die of anger. - You couldn't have made me happier. - My pleasure. - Give him two thousand louis. - No Sire, I don't want any money. I owe you a reward. What do you want? To defend my honor, arms in hand. Instead of being beaten like a lackey. - I would have to give you a title. - Make him a knight, Sire, I beg of you. Do you swear to be a good, wise, virtuous, and valiant knight? I swear. In the name of Saint Louis, I dub you a knight. You made fun of me and I made you a knight. We're even. If I'm not below your rank, I'm at your disposal. Name the time and place. Beware, La Tour! Colonel, the standard has been retrieved. Let your troops return to their quarters. You can be showered in glory some other time. Row by three, trot, march! Two Frenchmen. Come on! Follow me! - Watch out, Monsignor! - The Austrians! We will kill you. Stay here. This way, Monsignor. Help! La Tour! Help me! La Tour, help me! Monsignor! Listen, Monsignor. I have a secret to tell you. I have a daughter, Antoinette. I loved her mother. She's sixteen years old. She lives in Paris, with Taupin. In Estrapade Square. You have to find her. Count on me. I leave all my possessions to her. Everything. JUDGMENT RENDERED IN ABSENTIA: KNIGHT LA TOUR WAS FOUND GUILTY OF TREACHEROUSLY MURDERING THE DUKE OF SAINT-SEVER AND IS SENTENCED TO BE HANGED UNTIL DEAD. Share this judgment with all police outposts along the road. Right away, Provost. Travel safely, Barberin. Give my regards to our Parisian colleagues and their ladies. I shall be delighted to see them. How silent it is. Dead silent. It seems even the canons are paying homage to Philippe by keeping quiet. But it's only because of the armistice. The war is over. The man I hated is six feet underground. I should be delighted. Well, yes. But I'm not. It's too dreadful, that actor who stabbed him in the back. - All deaths are the same. - I can no longer sleep. I feel as if it were me who stabbed him. It's not your fault. I'm a criminal. At least by intent. You are a duke. The last Duke - of Saint- - Sever. - Be quiet! - You need to get used to it. It all belongs to you now. The name, the fortune, the land... And even... My lady. - So? - Bad. Everyone has taken off. I'll prove my innocence, but first I must go to Paris. Us too. We'll hide you in the wagon, Riquet. No, it's too dangerous for you. I'll manage on my own. - Be careful. They have your description. - Hold it! Look here. They won't get me. Hey, Riquet. See you in Paris on the evening of Saint Henri. It's your saint day. Go hide. This is the entrance to Paris. KNIGHT LA TOUR WAS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDERING THE DUKE OF SAINT-SEVER AND IS TO BE HANGED UNTIL DEAD. - Halt. - What is that? It's fodder for the royal stables. I come every week. Go on, country bumpkin. - Stop! - Hmm? Saber this hay. Come on, that's good. Get out of here. Good God, there's someone in there. Get that wagon. Get going, you lazy bunch! The Saint Henri celebrations are over! Lafleur, are you sleeping? Come on, hurry up! Catch them! Come on! Tell me who it is or I'll take you away. I'm innocent. I swear. I simply took pity on a poor beggar from Germany. That fellow there, a beggar? Ye gods! What if it's La Tour? Guards! Dead or alive, just bring him back! Use your intuition and be subtle! He's a dangerous man! No tomfoolery amongst yourselves! All for one and one for all. Either way, the bounty will go into my pocket. Dismount. Hurry up. Let's go! Again, again! HORTENSE TAUPIN RETAIL TRADE FOR LADIES Two men with me. And you, Pichon, go tell the chief. That's not true. This is our drink break. It will whet our appetites. Impossible, my dear Taupin. We're all going to die. After the paté, oysters, kidneys, and brains. Go on, Aristide, take some beef stew and pour some calvados over it. A double serving for the gentleman. She's cute. We could eat her too. - Please. - Come on! He's right. You have to enjoy everything in life. Such behavior is unacceptable coming from an associate. Yes, think of me, please! After twelve wines, we no longer know what we're doing. Yes, he thought he was pinching you, Mme Cornillon Jeune. If we ourselves, licensed traders, do not set an example, - France is lost! - And the revolution is upon us. Hurry up and eat before it gets here! Toinon! Sir? Don't forget to serve the poultry over a bed of morels. Drink, drink, drink - What is it? - Is your name Toinon? - You have nerve. - I'm looking for a girl named Antoinette. - Is that you? - Yes. What do you want? I have important things to tell you. - Tell it to someone else, Mr. La Tour. - You recognize me? I've seen you act at the Court of the Marais. Then, listen to me. I'm being pursued and hunted because of you. You exaggerate. I'm just a servant. No! You're the daughter of a duke. - You're putting on a show. - Please, you have to believe me. Do you make up stories to get with girls? It won't work with me. I'm serious. Listen, they're coming! They're coming to the house. Hide me! - Then, it's all true? - Yes, it's true. Quick, come to the front door. From suckling pig to Mirabelle plums... - Thank you. - Are you injured? - No, it's nothing. - Come on, quickly. Me, a merchant of tricorn hats. I was accosted in the street by one of these women. I had to chase the beggar with a parasol. They have no pride. If you saw the dresses these harlots are buying. - Duchess hand-me-downs. - How shameful. They even attack newlyweds. Right, Aristide? Fortunately, we have decency. There's no way to put these tramps in their place. - There is a way, Mrs. Cornillon. - Are you kidding? My husband never kids, Mr. Cornillon Jeune. He's a serious, well-informed man. If you're approached by one of these girls, lead her by the ear to the nearest police station. - You'll get a pistole. - A pistole would be nice. - She'll be sent to the Americas. - Into the wild. It's what the tarts deserve. While dying, he told me the secret of your birth. His last words were for you. His daughter. My father. I'm learning of his existence and death at the same time. - You are now Duchess of Saint- - Sever. I can't believe it. This marrow salpicon with morels is my recipe. Listen to this. A layer of poached bone marrow. A layer of morels. A layer of foie gras. That's it! All spread on fried canapés, sprinkled with ground pepper. Excellent for the liver. You, there. We're going to have a chat with the howlers. Toinon, the chickens! Come on, shout with me. It will make them come faster. The chickens! My God... Who's there! The King's Police, open up! I like that better! We will explain ourselves. Toinon, get the door! Come. What did you do? I'm accused of murdering your father. Anybody coming? - Toinon! - Yes? Are you deaf? We're looking for a killer who may have broken into your home. A killer? Heavens, that's terrible. Inspector, you can count on my help. I don't doubt it. Nicolas Taupin, civilian collaborator to Commissioner Podevin of the Val de Grâce station. My colleagues' associates are my associates. Thank you. Welcome to my humble abode. Our search may be dangerous. Return to your guests. If that's an order, I shall obey. Search the house! Chamonot! The kitchen is mine. Don't be afraid my child. I'm not unkind. Quite the contrary. And that's it. I came searching for a scoundrel, and what did I find? A pretty little girl. Police inspectors aren't millionaires. They are honest, poorly paid workers. We don't know how to give credit where credit is due. Although the police can do without honest people, honest people cannot do without the police. However, I have a few louis I've been saving. They are yours, lovely girl, if you let me kiss you. Not with everyone else around. I wouldn't dare. Oh, you bring me joy. I will prove my gratitude one hundred times over. - Go ahead, honey. - After you. You're my guest. - I'll be there very soon. - Hurry. My colleagues say I'm a flirt. We're going on the roof. - I won't be able to get down. - It's a piece of cake. Come on. - What are you doing? - Making an English stir-fry! Leave your sauces. Come, now. Let me out, you tramp. Chamonot! Chamonot! Let me out, you bastards. - Where is the maid? - I don't know. Gone with the killer. Sound the alert! Calling all sections of the Guard. Comb the area! Catch the runaway! - Run to the Saint- - Sever mansion. Rue de la Verrerie. Ask your cousin for protection for you and for me. - I'll never get through. - Hide over there. Leave it to me. Come on, let's go. Hold him tight. He's cornered. Take care of the Knight of Saint Louis's lodgings. And be respectful. He'll have the best dungeon in the Petit Châtelet. Goodbye, gentlemen. My pleasure. - Did they catch Toinon? - No, the tramp took off. With our hundred-pound savings. Yes, there's something fishy going on. I'll notify the authorities. - What do you want? - -To see the Duke of Saint- - Sever. - What about? - It's personal. Come in. Follow me. I'm the duke's private secretary. You can speak in complete confidence. - -Philippe of Saint- - Sever was my father. - Really? That's impossible. Before he died, he told the secret of my birth to Knight La Tour. What you're telling me is very interesting. - Come this way. - My cousin must intervene. La Tour has been arrested for murder, and he's surely innocent. It's a scandal. A miscarriage of justice that the duke shall correct. Right this way. Have fun, bastard child! François? - Did you hear that? - No. I'm frightened. It wasn't a human cry. You have too much imagination. Not imagination, memories. - Do you miss your Don Juan? - You know very well that I don't. I lived in this house for a year with Philippe. I beg of you, François, take me to my country, where we can be alone, without a ghost between us. It would be too easy. I want you to love me here, in this mansion of his. - But why? - Because I was jealous of Philippe and everything he had. François, swear to me that you had nothing to do with Philippe's death. I'm not a man who would stab another in the back. His murder disgusts me. If I had the killer, - I'd shoot him like a dog. - Enough bloodshed. Oh, François, let me love you. You said that to Philippe before me. You went from his arms to mine. In your arms, I learned how to truly love. Please, get me out of this pit! You are where you belong, - Miss Saint- - Sever. There you shall stay. Pity. She was a very hardworking and very clean servant. Sorry to deprive you. You should have watched her better. It's that scoundrel La Tour's fault. I'd like to attend his funeral. I'm sure you will soon have the pleasure. As soon as justice is served, you shall rid me of Toinon for good. Count on me to expedite it. You will continue to receive your pension each month in exchange for your silence. It shall reflect your generosity. It's a breath of fresh air here. The air of freedom, which one only experiences when one has seen others rotting on straw in a dungeon. It's hot, huh? Cheers, handsome man. You're a real bastard. I hope you die swiftly. Oh, you're not very polite. You're not thirsty in your hole. It's cool down there. The walls are always damp. One day you'll be down there for good! You can be so discouraging when you want to be. I came to talk, but it's impossible to converse with you. Well... I'm going to have a bite to eat, although I'm not hungry. You're not ashamed to stuff yourself in front of me? That's up to you. Just one small gesture and we'll both fill up. Excuse me, Inspector. It will only take a few minutes. Go on, hustle. So, will you sign your initials? No, I wasn't the one who killed him. Sure, it was the imperial soldiers. Take a look at this! That's not possible! Hello! Don't deny the obvious, you planted this dagger in his back. "Hello!" Would you quit the ruckus? Get out of here. - And my work? - You can finish it when I call you. Hey! Leave it, I'll be back! Out you go! You see, everything comes out in the end. - Now, sign. - No. Listen, it would be in your interest to make my job easier. I'm a policeman with modern ideas. A father who hates violence. I saw you in action. Especially with little Toinon. Whom you stole from me, by the way. Come on, we were made to get along with one another. You have one advantage over me: you're handsome. When I think of what some of my colleagues, men who are two centuries behind the times, would do to your handsome face. Oh, it hurts my heart. If I sign, can I count on you? Of course, a policeman is a man of his word. Then, give me the paper. Finally, you're being reasonable. How do you expect me to sign wearing all this metal? - I'm thirsty. - Sure, now that you're being good! Where do I... - Where do I have to sign? - There. Hey, Dad is coming up. About time. It's his turn to be in the sun. Come look at this. Guards! Hey, I think you should take the same way down. Somersaults are my specialty. Catch that scoundrel, dead or alive! Where did you come from? Look! He swimming toward the Grands Augustins dock. Without warning! On my command! Fire. MIMES OF THE ITALIAN THEATER TO OUR DEARLY DECEASED LA TOUR Countess. The troupe thanks you for obtaining authorization from the archbishop. If I had known of his arrest, it's the King's Police lieutenant I would have gone to find. If La Tour could hear you, he would be happy. But he can't hear you anymore. This death has devastated me. Go ahead, Mirabelle... Go. Here, take care of this toy. The Armorers Corporation gave me the list. There are seventy-nine of them. Well, it's worth it. What about me? Do I have anything to do? You're my liaison. Come on, Alexandre! Oh, he's handsome! Clothes collecting. Do you have clothes to sell? Do you have clothes to sell? - So? - It was his funeral. His body was fished out the day before last. Now that La Tour is dead, rid me of the heiress. - This very evening. I like to act quickly. - Me too... Eustace! Well, here you are, Mr. Taupin. Well, Miss Mirabelle. I thought you were still in Bavaria. I apologize for appearing so disheveled in front of a beauty like you. It doesn't matter. Are you a clothing salesman? That's Mrs. Taupin. I have a private practice. Which, if I understand correctly, gives you complete freedom. To invite you to dine at Petit Bouillon du Calvaire. - That would be an extravagance. - They give me a discount. This afternoon, I have free tickets to the Chinese Cabaret. - You'll fall into ruin! - No. Winter stinky cheese, summer cottage cheese. Lost the strength to shout? Are you sleeping? Here's something that will wake you up! It's good news, don't you think? OUR DEARLY DECEASED LA TOUR God, we're high up. What floor are we on? - Seventh heaven. - Ah, what a morning! There are more luxurious inns, but it's not the setting that counts, it's the man. And do you like the man? Maybe a little. Maybe a lot. Passionately. Madly. Stop. If you remove anything else, it won't happen at all. Forgive my impatience, Mirabelle. I feel twenty. - You're more than twice that. - I'm in the prime of life. Ah, my friend. You must have had some adventures in life. So many I've lost count. - What a charmer. - I can't help it. I was born this way. - You are adorably modest. - It's my gift. - Right down to your fingers. - Your swats are like caresses. Come tell me over here. You don't have to tell me twice, dear. Let's get down to business. - Dirty tramp! - Snitch. It's an ambush! Oh! It's an ambush. Leave me alone. Get off me, scoundrels! Please, let me go! Is it money you want? - No, information! - Go ahead, it's my job. Tell us what you know about Toinon, - the Duke of Saint- - Sever's daughter. - Never! - We'll see about that! Clothes collecting Do you have clothes to sell? That's the name, Pierrot. That's Mr. Pérouge, - the Duke of Saint- - Sever's secretary. He bought the dagger here, six months ago. - You did a good job, Uncle. - I knew the fortieth try would be the one. - I turned forty yesterday. - Hurry! - We're meeting the others at the wagon. - Right. ROOMS FOR RENT La Tour will be pleased with us. He'll be able to pull out all the stops tonight. We must go tell Pierrot. THE BOUQUET OF VIRTUES Thank you, Pierrot. We're here thanks to you. - The snitch said she's in a dungeon. - I'll get her out of there. Come here. I found the hatch. There, look. Go down the rope. Wait for me in the street. - I can't go with you to the mansion? - No, Pérouge is there. It's too dangerous. Alright, fine. I'll keep watch. Help me! Be quiet. It's me, La Tour. Don't be afraid, I'm not a ghost. - Why did you break into my home? - See this dagger? - Yes. - It belongs to Pérouge. I have proof. - I don't see... - -Saint- - Sever was killed with this weapon. Pérouge? No, that's impossible. And he locked Philippe's daughter in a dungeon. I don't believe it. Show me the way to the cellar and I'll prove it. Come. - The carriage is waiting. - Good, let's go. - Hear that? - Quick, open the door! Let me go! Let me go! Hurry, to the police station. - I owe you a thousand thanks, my dear. - You owe me a thousand crowns. Well worth it. Let's go! Did you see it yourself? I saw a carriage, that's all. I can show you the cellar where Philippe's daughter was held captive. - All of this is absurd. - No, François. You have to believe me. Come. - Pérouge, what is all of this? - Let me go. I can't breathe! Admit that you were the one - who killed Philippe of Saint- - Sever. Speak! You sent Philippe's daughter away with Taupin. Yes. Do you believe it now? I regret nothing! Philippe stole my wife. I took revenge on him and his daughter, whom you will never find. Never! Knight La Tour, if you need a lawyer from the King... What torture! My feet are bleeding. Stay strong, Margot. We're almost there. La Rochelle is only 20 leagues away. It was written on the last sign. You know how to read, yet they're sending you to the Americas. Hey, keep walking! Poor Margot. Let's keep going. Let's give the tramps some water! I've never drank anything so good. Hurry up, girls, or you'll get the whip! - All there's left to do is keep going. - We have to get out of the water first. Hey, what's your name? - Miss Saint- - Sever. No kidding? So, Duchess, did you have a musk bath? You'll pay for that, braggart! - Come on! - Let's go! - Heya! - Come on! - Go on! - Hey! - Heya! - Hey! Let's go! This meat will never be cooked. You should have told me sooner. Don't worry. It'll be fine for these filthy girls. Quick! Time to eat! This pineau is surprisingly elegant. - Hey, Saint- - Sever! You're on water duty! Mouronval! Escort the duchess and her maids to the well. Have them draw fifty buckets each. That will calm their tempers. You two, go with her! They have some audacity. Oh, hey! Over here! Sir, your little guitar! Hey! Colonel, we request the honor of entertaining your staff. Come on! Watch out. Hello there, gentlemen. You're about to witness some magic. My right hand is empty, my left hand is empty. Oh, what do I see there? A fresh egg, from today. Well, gentlemen, I'm going to make it disappear. It disappeared. Where is it? There it is! Yes, there's that egg. Watch carefully, I'm going to make it disappear. Where is it now? Ah... there! There it is! Ah... - Hurry up, tramps. I'm hungry! - We're starving too. Are you going to take all day? No, we're finished now! That way, quickly! Toinon. - Thank you, Henri. - It's my fault you're here. I owed you this. Quickly, now. Let's go! How about you? Do you dance? What fun! A show like that, and for free! We were in luck. It's not hard. They're phonies! - Let me out! - What's going on? Open up! Come on, men! Follow me! To arms! The girls have escaped! An actor cornered me. Bring them back! Go after them! Show them no mercy! Bring them back! Dead or alive! Make those harlots and scoundrels pay! No need to worry! The police are going to catch us. We got them! - Keep me with you in the troupe. - It's out of the question. - Miss Saint- - Sever. - I'll give up all my rights. - No way. I gave your father my word. But I don't want to leave. I love you. Toinon. You're the daughter of a duke. You're a knight. Henri, my love. Where are we headed now? - To Versailles, the king's palace! - Oh, goody! Let's go!
