NETFLIX PRESENTS News in Andalusia. Good afternoon. Construction companies warn of a lack of workers in the sector, causing unrest among unions. What I want to know is where are the companies and where is the work. There are hundreds of people who want to work in these sectors. Don't say these things to me because it sounds like, once again, the people of Cádiz don't want to work. What they need to do say where the work is... People are lining up... - Good evening. - Evening. How is everything? I can't complain. I thought you were going to Córdoba. I ended up changing it. And Lorena? I'm right here, doctor. Working my shift. - How old is the boy? - Eight years old. My son... Thank you, doctor. Honey, it's good news. Weren't you listening? But keep in mind that he has to remain in observation because it was a delicate operation. No, but we're optimistic, María José. - We have to be. - You hear that? He'll be fine. Fran, bring some Kleenex. Doctor, anything you need, let me know. - No, that's okay, Juan. - Yes, I insist. Anything. DVD, Blu-ray, TV, soccer tickets... Anything. Hey, Dad, if you stand me up today, I swear I'll find myself another running partner. Okay, see you later. ...work and they say the bank promised them rent control. We ask for rent like we have all along. And we feel tricked because they made an estimate, they came to remodel... If they don't reach a deal, tomorrow they'll have to move out.

When you started going out you were inseparable, Marcos. Marcos, stop. - Cramp. - That's what you get for smoking. - I stopped. - Bullshit. Alberto told me you go up to the roof to smoke. Seriously, you have to quit. Very funny, Alberto. Did you cut yourself shaving? Maybe. Come on, let's go. Marcos, I said no. I have a cramp, man. And these tennis shoes are killing me. - Tennis shoes. - Yeah, what? No one calls them that. - No? What do they call them? - Boots. Boots? What bullshit. Don't make excuses. - Give me a second. - It's from smoking. Give me a second! You're getting old! No, you're the one getting old. I'm already old. Let's go. Bastard! - Where did you buy these sneakers? - These? On-line. On-line? Didn't you have some Asics too? Who knows where your mother put them. Is your arch pronation or supination? - Are you shitting me? - No. - Hi. - Good morning. - Can you take me? - Fly, Marcos, fly. Okay, I'll jump in the shower. - How are you? - Exhausted. Well, you can sleep now. You shouldn't have to take him every day. What? He's old enough to have a car, Carmen. Not again with the car... Nothing out of this world. A Polo, a Yaris... I don't see it. He's working, he deserves it. If you're sure... I am. A hybrid. She was a runner up in the contest. - What contest? - Photography. Oh, that's great. She's in her room. Can I come in? I have to go to class, what's up? I wanted to congratulate you. - What for? - The photography contest you won. Well, runner up. Well, runner up. Congratulations.

Come on, hurry up. Marcos! Okay, Dad. I'm going to class. - Have a good day. - Bye. - Marcos? - Wait for me. - Get some rest. Love you. - Me too. Come on, don't forget anything. Let's go, sweetie. Two o'clock. Hello, good afternoon. News about the alleged sexual attack on a female soldier at the Bobadilla base who reported a gang rape. Biological tests taken on the soldier... - Here you go, Rebeca. - Thank you. What's up, doctor? Going home? We all have to sleep sometimes, yeah. Look at her, sleeping it off. - Honey, the doctor's here! - No, let her sleep, please. Why don't you go home, Juan? Your son is progressing well. If there's any change, we'll call your cell. There's nothing you can do here. Thanks. Do you have children? Then you know that's impossible. Doing nothing. They're inflating the prices of certain medications, for example, cancer, even though most of the research was paid for with public money. The PP in Murcia demands the resignation of the ex-mayor of Cartagena for sexist comments he made about their candidate and regional spokesperson, Noelia Arroyo. It's 7:50, in the Canary Islands. "Today," with Natalia Perales. Good morning, Susana Díaz... Don't touch me, he's my son! Sir, outside. Hey, calm down. Calm down. I thought you said he was fine! Let go of me, damn it! Hey, take it easy. Please, let us work. Trust us. Okay? Víctor... - What happened? - He had a seizure. - Don't touch me! He's my son! - Calm down. - Sudden? - Yes. - 50 milligrams of propanolol. - Don't touch me, damn it! Get his parents out of there. It's okay, Salva. Are you okay? Salva, look at me. Salva, look at me. Salva, look at me. Look at me. And this line here, you know what it's for? To indicate that everything is fine. Look. It's perfect. You can make music too, look. What happened, Salvador? Yeah, what happened? We were sending you home already. You might have to stay with us for a few more days. Until we know what happened. You understand, right? Even better. You get to skip more days of school. You want to go home, right, Salva? Home with your mommy and daddy? Jaime. Daddy behaves badly with Mommy, doesn't he? And with you? Okay, let's relax a little now and try to get some sleep. Go on, get some rest. Sleep. Paula, can you give us a second? Thanks. Get some rest, champ, okay? Drop it, Jaime. Let the psychologist determine any actions necessary. Remember the last time. We can't meddle in these things, you know that. Doctor Jiménez. We need to avoid any contact with the parents. That's not up to us, Jaime. - Doctor Jiménez! - Not now. Talk to Sánchez Monte. See how we proceed with the report. - I think you're exaggerating. - I'm not, Alberto. - I think so. - You saw the dad... Doctor Jiménez, please. I need you to come with me. Can't you see I'm busy? Call someone else! What is he doing in here? Get him out. Jaime, you can't. - Let me help. - There's nothing you can do, Jaime. Leave it to us. Get him out of here. Come on, let's go. But he's my son. Jaime. He'll be okay, you'll see. It's okay. Take it easy. This is the last image we have of Marcos before the beating. His attacker or attackers didn't take his wallet or money and his moped is still in the parking lot, so we've ruled out a robbery. Then why? We haven't found your son's cell phone or his house keys, so I suggest you change the locks. Do you recognize anyone? A friend or acquaintance of Marcos? This is Pedro, they've been friends since school. And Salva, the other one is Salva. And Luis. Pedro Pimentel, Luis Laseca and Salvador Gordillo. Yes, we've spoken with all three. This is Andrea, his girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. They broke up. How well do you know - Pedro Pimentel? - Pedro... and Marcos have been friends since they were little. He's like family. Why? He's retracted a couple times, but he might just be nervous. Well, that's all for now. If there's any news, we'll let you know. What happened? What did she want? She wanted to ask more questions. What questions? About Marcos and his friends. If they took drugs, stuff like that. - Yes? - Andrea, it's... Marcos' father. I suppose you've heard. Yeah, I know. I'd like you to come see him. It would do him good, I'm sure of it. Andrea, are you still there? Dad. Dinner is ready. I'm not hungry. News on Radio Andalusia. Lorenzo Romero producing music this whole time. Greetings from Juan Antonio Jurado, starting with a memory, a hit in the seventies called: "I'm Sorry"... I only want to speak to him for a moment, please. I can't give you that information. Mr. Jiménez? Mr. Jiménez? Yes. I'm Manuel Barrero, the owner of the AP3. The nightclub where... Well... I've very sorry about what happened to your son. Thank you. We put surveillance cameras in the parking lot. We have a kid watching as well. I know that doesn't undo what happened... That's why we'd like to do more. Do what? I don't know, help with the medical expenses. - No, that's okay, thank you. - Right. This really sucks. I know it sucks for you, but... it sucks for us too. For business. It's bad publicity for... I understand what you must be going through. I'm a father, and if anything happened to my son... That's why I really want to help you. Thank you very much. Look, I'm going to ask... If you have a chance to talk to the press or the police, please tell them we had nothing to do with it. We're victims. We're victims just like you. Good night. Jesus, Dad! I'm exhausted! Three hours, 59:30. I beat the shit out of you. If only you didn't work so much. I love you. - Girls, I'm off. - Okay. See you later. Jaime. - How are you, Pedro? - Well, okay. Okay. - I ordered you a beer. - Thanks. Hey, boss. Thanks. How is Marcos? The same. Right. Pedro. I need you to tell me what happened that night. It was Salva, Cate and me. Cate wanted to go to the Cartuja and Marcos said he wanted to stay. I think he saw a girl he liked and didn't want us to see him hit on her in case he got rejected. The police say you told different versions. Why? No, that's not true. Pedro... I went back to the club... to get Marcos. Marcos was already on the ground. I was scared, Jaime. I'm really sorry, and... Then you saw his face. - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell the police? Because they saw me. - They saw you. - Yeah. There were several? Yeah, there were several. You have to tell the police. No, no... - Yes. - I can't do that, Jaime. They'd be out the next day and come after me. You have to tell the police. I can't. They know me, they saw my face. Sorry. Sorry. There were four of them. They go there a lot. One of them recorded everything. He recorded it? Yeah. He recorded the beating with his cell phone. Who? I don't know. I don't know his name. He's not really tall and... his hair is dyed white. - See you later. - Bye, have a good one. He works in a gas station near the nightclub. Need any help? No, thank you. Nice car... How much was it? What's up? - Champ! - Where have you been? Hanging out, where were you? - Who's that, your grandpa? - What? I don't know, some old guy. No way, he would have gotten out. Hey, let me in. Let me go for a ride. Dickhead. Hey, let me go for a ride! Come on! Just around the block. He's a douchebag. He's going to jerk off. Hey, you might be right. Came here to jerk off, huh? What a douchebag. My friend says you're a douchebag. You jerking off or what? What a pussy. What's up? He asked you a question, damn it! He's a douchebag, see? He's jerking off right in front of us. Want me to show you my tits? Where are you going? Come back, you fucking coward! - Douchebag! - Fuck off! Come back, you coward! Dad? What are you doing here? Get in, I'll take you home. I'm with a friend. What were you doing there? And you? What were you doing there? Dad? Dad? None of your business. What? I hear Mom crying every night. Of course. - This isn't easy for anyone. - Yeah. She's devastated, Sara. No, Dad. She's not the one I'm worried about. I still haven't seen you cry. Dad. Dad! Please, stop.

Look, I'm sorry, but I can't help thinking about what we had. Andrea, I've done things for you I haven't done for anyone. I didn't want to study abroad to be with you. What about what we had? I don't want this to end. - I'm sorry, but it can't go on. - I know I screwed up a lot. But I think about you every night. Who made the first move? You or him? If it was him, I can understand, but if it was you, it's disappointing... Are you really...? What's up? Holy shit, you're back together? We're talking. Oh, then you're still free, eh? - What are you talking about? - Marcos, I have to go. Slow down, I like seeing you two together, damn it. Hold on a second. Let's see... Look. Here. I don't want any. - Just one and we'll leave. - I said no. Fine, more for me, no problem. Damn! Here, here. Marcos, here. Hey, Andrea, what was I going to say? Seriously. Are you really with that dickhead now? What do you care? And he's not a dickhead, okay? That's a yes, that's a yes. Sure, since his dad owns the AP3, right? Free drinks, VIP passes, you can do whatever you want. - What the fuck are you saying? - Okay, be nice. I'm joking, damn it. Take it easy. Come on, Andrea. - Do a line. - I don't want to, damn it. - Just one. - I said no. Don't insist. She's not your girlfriend anymore, right? Let her defend herself, okay? Come on, do one. Go on. That's it. - Happy? - Very happy. Then start the fucking car already. It's Luis. He says he's coming. We should wait for him, right? Give me your cell phone for a second. Hi! What's up?
