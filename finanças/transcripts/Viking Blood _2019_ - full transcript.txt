Take her alive. Stop. Now, who might you be? Who's asking? I'm the one who's asking. Are you a Christian? My sword is my god. What do you have there? Bastard! We'll kill you, bastard! What's wrong with you? I don't want that here. It's a woman? No, you should not have come. This village is full of only death and horrors. Oh, my. How did this happen? Who is she? It's a warning, no doubt. This is Freya. Her sister's Gudrun the Fearless, who's said to be the daughter of a Valkyrie for real, and in battle. She is a fierce shield-maiden who brought the Christian god to our village. So why this? Oh, no, you should not have come. You should leave as soon as possible. I urge you. No, no, no, no, no, no! Tell me the story, old man, and get me some mead and food. I'm parched and starving. Yes, of course. Something to drink. Something to eat. It all began when Gudrun and the earl went to raid in England. The earl? Yes, yeah. In this town, the earl and the Lord is the same person. His name is Odinsson. Yes, he's true to the old godsend, despises the Christians. Gudrun and the earl, they stayed in England for many years. Gudrun fell in love with a Christian man. Yeah, she began to replace Odin the Allfather, and the other gods, with the one Christian god. Odinsson was not pleased, so he killed Gudrun's Christian man. Yes. On her return, she gathered all her followers and established a Christian church on the other side of town. There have been a war ever since. Is this Gudrun wealthy? Ah, it's said she brought with her much wealth from the churches in England. Yes. But most of it was confiscated by Odinsson. I think I shall go and see her. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, you should leave at sunset. No, no, they will kill you. I think I'll stay. Sounds like a profitable place to be. Keep her safe. Are you Christian? I am whatever you want me to be. Why are you here? I found a woman tied to a cross in the forest. I'm told she's your sister. Freya? Where is she? Safe. For now. And the priests? I don't know about any priests. I demand that you bring her back immediately. Easy. Easy. I will. But she will cost you 30 pieces of silver. I will not pay you that. I'm sure the earl will be happy to pay me. Bastard. If you don't want your sister back... Pay him. This better not be deceit. It's not. Helga. Profitable town. You're a heartless mongrel. Careful what you say, Agnir, or I'll have your tongue. Tell me about Odinsson. Sounds like someone I should meet. He's not someone you should be playing with. His hound, Tor, will certainly kill you. I don't ask much of you. Maiden. I am no maiden. I am Astrid, and I, too, am the sister of Gudrun. She wishes to speak with you. If she has silver, I have a sword. Then come now. I would like to thank you personally again for my sister. It is truly horrible what those heathens did to her. I would like to make a proposal. What kind of proposal? Join with the side of God, and revenge her. And help us drive the heathen off this land. Sounds reasonable. What would you say that's worth to you? I can offer you 20 pieces of silver. I'll do it for 80. 80? Half now and half when the deed is done. That's too much. - I just paid you for... - For your sister's life. 30, then. With room and board. 40. 60! 60 pieces of silver. And I'll take a room. Who tied up the pretty girl in the forest? Must have been you and you. And me! 30 silver pieces. Swift work. You have revenged Freya's dignity, and have earned my trust. Helga? Show him to his room. Is he in his room? Yes. What makes you think he's not the devil in disguise? I don't think we can trust the stranger. We don't even know his name. Did you see his ring? Yes. Probably stolen or ill-gotten. We cannot risk everything we fought for. We should kill him in his sleep. Astrid! God brought him to us for a reason. Would that reason be to kill him? Where are the priests, then? Who's to say he did not kill them? As well as take our sister for ransom. We shall wait until Freya's awake before making any rash decisions. He is of use to us for now. Of course, my hope is that the word of our plight reach our brothers across the sea. What about the 60 pieces of silver? You've already paid him. We could get that back. Come on, Gudrun. Let me kill him. Fine. Fine. The warrior will disturb the balance of the gods. I see a man from far away lands with no faith. He's not the common man. What do you mean? I can only tell you what I see. I cannot decipher its meaning. Many will die. Be warned, you must kill him. If not, you yourself will die. Many will die. Leaving us already? I told you he couldn't be trusted. I will not be stabbed in the back as I sleep. I'll keep the 30 pieces for your sister. How did you... Coward! Fine work, Astrid. This is not a warrior we want roaming around causing trouble. Odinsson will come down hard on us for the killings. You're not my sister. We will learn the truth from Freya when she's awake. We still have the support of the blacksmith. There can be no war without good weapons. Keep that information between us. Must not be openly known. His support depends on it. You? I thought you had been killed. I would let you know. I need some food and mead. It's been a long day. Yes, of course. Will you be resting here tonight? I might. Yes. What is your experience with these Christians? Oof. I think they would prefer to live their lives in peace, 'cause they were, of course, all followers of the old gods before. But I don't think you can change faith so easily. I saw Astrid speaking to the seer today. I don't think Odin would look kindly on a Christian using his gifts. She's certainly doesn't seem very Christian to me. But then again, it seems this god is no different than the others. They make believers do bad deeds in their name. Perhaps it's just an excuse? I tell you this, Agnir, this village will much better off with these gods gone. It shall be my gift to you, to get rid of them all. You're a crazy bastard. And I'm certain you will be killed. But you should get a better sword. The blacksmith here in town is the most skilled in the whole kingdom. His work is praised even by the king himself. Is that so? to that. A good morning to you. How was your rest? Sound. Ah, today's gonna be a busy day, then, huh? Here, my friend, a warm drink to get you on your way. Good man. Lock in the light. Much work to be done here. A storm is coming. Agnir told me you're the finest craftsman in the kingdom. Your fame precedes you. It usually does. People have been talking, the way that you killed Odinsson's men made them look weak. Why are you here? I'm just here to make a few coins like everyone else. But I need an upgrade. Fine work. Almost looks like one of my own. It's seen some action, though. It's an old sword. Was my father's before me. Mm. I might have something for you. What do you mean by "a storm is coming"? One will have to choose sides. Which side do you choose? War's good for me. Whichever side ultimately wins. I just make the weapons. Now, that is a sword. Her name is Grim. She was forged of iron not of this world. Only the fires of hell were hot enough to melt it. How much do you want for it? It is a sword for the worthy. Any payment is purely a gesture of respect. Blacksmith? Yes, Olav? And the sword? 100 pieces of silver. Stranger. The earl wants to see you in his hole. Let's go. Great. Leave the sword here. Take care of it for me. I shall be back to get her. My lord, this is the stranger that killed three of our men. So you are the famous stranger. It seems you have already caused quite the stir in my town. He killed three of our men at the front gates. So in the tower, was that you too? I should really kill you for that. They insulted me when I arrived to this town. It is my right to defend myself. It's not my fault that your men cannot fight. Listen to him. What do you want? 500 pieces of silver for the information I'm about to give you. You better bring me Gudrun's head for that price. There are ships arriving. Let him pass. What ships? The king's ships. If this turns out to be false, I will have you fileted like a bloody cod. Feels a bit light. It is 50. You can come back for the rest. Very well. I'll be going, then. We confiscated your horse so you don't run off. My lord. We will have to make use of this information. Inform Tor to take a troop of his best warriors to the beach. It's the only place they can possibly land close by. And get someone back in the tower. My lord, it's done. Our situation has changed. Go and invite Gudrun and her closest flank for a feast tonight. We shall make peace with the Christians. Peace? After what she's done to this town? We must run them out, and kill them. In due time, my wife. A plan is underway. Just do as I ask. I will trust that. It's a small garden. They must have split up the troops to protect the ships. Mm-hm. Valuable information indeed. I've changed my mind about you, Stranger. I will pay you to work for me. That's very good and well, but you're in a truce, are you not? What will you have me do? There shall be bloodshed soon enough, and I will need your sword. Here are 50 gold pieces. That should suffice and cover the rest of the payment. Very generous. I shall need my horse back as well. Get him his horse. Much obliged. I'm at your service. Don't stray too far. My lady. We're saved. Good to see you finally awake, my sister. The bishop has come across the narrow sea at my invitation. The king has agreed to dispatch an escort. They come in force. Bless you, my child, for having suffered the pain of our savior. Thank you, Father. We have to know what happened to our brothers when you left England. We haven't heard a word, and after seeing you like this, I do fear the worst. I tried to protect them, but there were just too many. Who were they? They must have been the earl's men. I saw the devil's face. Tell us what happened, my child. Brother Richard was hit. Edwin and I, we tried to hide in the woods. And I managed to kill one of them, but as Edwyn ran off, he took an arrow, so... I could still hear him screaming as I was knocked out. So he may still be alive. Do you know where they took him? No, I don't, but maybe the man who saved me? There might be hope yet. Rest now, Freya. Get well. Peace be with you. Thank you. We will pray for your speedy recover. There must be a reckoning. We must find our brother and avenge the death of Richard in the name of God. This blasphemy cannot go unpunished. My dearest bishop, we are all outraged and agree that this is a delicate matter. We have just made peace with Odinsson, and we cannot just break that peace without a cause. Without a cause? Have you seen what they did to Freya? Let me try and find out where Brother Edwyn is, and we shall take action based upon that information. This is Denmark, not England. The old gods still reside here. We must tread with cunning. I hope you're right. Show restraint. Gudrun, this is good. We can finally take what's ours. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the old ways. We're at peace with Odinsson, and so it shall remain. But we now have enough men to rid the town of the earl and his old gods. It is not the Christian way. We cannot ask the king's escort to fight against Odinsson. He's the earl, and pays tribute to the king. I shall see him converted. It is a dream, Gudrun, nothing more. The sooner you come to accept that, the greater the chance that we will survive this. We must destroy them. We shall pray and feast tonight, for we're together. And the good men who have come must be thirsty. God will reveal his wishes in due time. Meanwhile, go find the stranger and invite him here. We must find out what he knows. The wife! Oh, he knows more about that than I do! To the king! I don't spend so much time home with the wife. He spends more time with ours than I do! Not even an invitation. We should go there right now and make Gudrun pay for her insolence. We shall not partake in their premature celebration. It is sure to be short-lived. This shall be the last supper. May Odin prove you right. It has been foretold. Mm. Wait here. I'll get Gudrun. He's here. It's not poisoned. How's your sister? Walk with me. Freya's recovering, thanks to you. She was worth the effort. You are perhaps more than just a sword? Perhaps I'm just the answer to your prayers. The Lord delivers. And if he doesn't? It's his will? There were priests traveling with Freya from England. We have reason to believe that one of them is still alive. I would like for you to go find him. What makes you think I would be interested? There would, of course, be a generous bounty for you should you succeed. He is of utmost importance. He carries knowledge about the faith. It needs to be written down. I'll go and have a look. You are a very expensive bread knife. You may still live. Five days gone and the peace holds. It is a false peace. Don't be so down just because your plan didn't work. Be happy. You still have your life. It won't be long now! Freya, my dear. It's good to see you up and about. You have recovered fast. It must have been your prayers, Sister. Where's the man who saved me? I want to thank him properly. He's here, in the village. And this peace that you make with the earl, do you think it will last? God wills it, and the bishop commends it. Is it God who wills it, or someone else? They're treacherous. We must see it through. To what end? I must see the bishop! What's happened? We were attacked at night. A few men are still protecting the ships, but it will not be long before they will overpower us. You must release the king's guard. Thorkil, with haste! Of course. Heathens. When the king hears this, he will send an army. We are under his protection. I told you! This is Odinsson's doing! Bastard. Shh, shh. Shh, I need to talk to you. You, it was you. Listen. Wait, I wanted to thank you for saving me. That was a noble act. We don't have much time. Gudrun told me about the two priests who were with you in the forest. You didn't know about them? One dead, and one you last saw alive. Yeah. I think I know where he is. Edwyn. - Shh. - Is Edwyn still alive? Maybe, maybe not. When I saw the silver cross on the bishop, I knew I'd seen the same cross before. We need to tell my sisters. If I find him, meet me at the trading post at sundown. Who are you? We don't have time for questions. - Thank you. - Come. Thank you. Who is it? It's me. Open up. What have you done? He saved my life. He's a messenger from God. Enough of that. Give this man a drink and some food. Of course. Freya's coming soon. I'll be back. Freya, she still alive? Yes. Oh, thank you. Thank you. You look like you haven't eaten for days. Edwyn. You're alive. And you. What happened to you? Here, have a seat. After they shot me, I was sure they were going to kill me, but a stranger saved me from my prison. Seems we have the same savior. We don't have much time. Here, take this. What is that? I cannot take this. This belongs to the bishop to the church. You have to take it, and you have to leave now. This is a tribute to Odinsson to keep the peace, but he has betrayed your faith. But what about Gudrun? Freya, listen, they realize he's gone. You're not safe here. The king's men will protect us. The king's men are dead. They're not coming back. We must leave now. God bless you. Go north and stay in the forest. Keep off the path, and do not stop in the camp with your sister. I will let her know. There must be no sign of them here. What have you done? What any decent man would do. Since when were you decent? Gudrun! I found the priest. Lord be praised. The Lord had nothing to do with it. I sent him with your sister. They're going north. When Odinsson finds out the priest is missing, he will surely come here. What have you done? A good deed. But at what cost? Odinsson! Where's the earl? Find out. Stranger, good you're here. Are you back already? There's been a terrible slaughter. What happened here? A raiding party? How many men are dead? Three, and the priest is gone. How did Gudrun find out - that the priest was here? - Where is Tor and the rest of our men? They rode ahead. What do you mean by that? Did we rout the king's men? Wife, quiet. Do not be ashamed to rout with the weak. They sailed back. The king's men sailed back. But I saw the ships burn. I saw the glow from the tower myself. Tell me, stranger, what is happening here? Seize him! So, where were you? Was it you who killed our guards?! Where is the priest?! Enough! Leave him. He's not gonna talk right now. Let him think about his answers. He will talk eventually. He is nothing more than a cowardly bastard, sneaking around like the trickster himself. Look at this. Don't honor him by comparing him to one of the gods. Take it to the earl. Think well, Stranger, or you will have a painful death. My lord. We retrieved this ring from the hand of the stranger. Combs, raven insignia. How did a mercenary end up with something this precious? Deceit and murder, no doubt. It's made for me. Thank you. Okay. Go. He must talk now. He is here, somewhere in this village. And if you find out that someone is hiding him, kill them! Stranger, I know you're here. Stranger! Come out, you little rat. You. Get in here, quick. I haven't seen him, yes, I swear! You're lying! The man who lives by the sword does not leave gold behind! I'm a trader! Many strangers pass through those doors. Many strangers pay for lodging! Yeah, and how many strangers have been coming through those doors lately? I don't take sides! I will feed and sell to anyone who pays, who prays to any god. It's all your killing that hurts my business! You listen here, if you see your little friend again, or I find out that you've been hiding him, I swear by the gods, I will skin you alive! Little rat. Blacksmith. Have you seen the stranger? The stranger? I haven't seen him since he came by to look at a sword. You mean this sword. She was stolen from me. It's nice to see her again. You can keep the sword. And if the stranger turns up, come and find me. Of course, Tor, I will. We must still maintain a certain order here. We're starting the war because of a stranger's action can... He cannot have acted alone and killed all our men. They were clearly not as good as... Why did he take the priest? What did he do with him? Think about it! He must have had help from the Christians. Why would he go through the trouble of freeing a priest?! Olav, good, you're here. Did you find him? No, my lord. I think you're right. He must have had help from the Christians. Yes, my lord. It's about time that we rout these Christians out of this town. Hear, hear! Gather the men. We do this now. It's already done, my lord. Let's go. I'll get you somewhere safe. Heavenly Father give us strength in our faith to overcome the heathens. Your god has abandoned us. My god? It is the only god. Have you lost your faith? Why should one god be better than many, when clearly he is not? Gudrun, you traded your spirit for falsehoods. When Odinsson killed your husband, he was only trying to protect you. What are you saying? How could you be so heartless? Where is your godliness? You made me choose, between my love of the gods and my love for you. You must see now that you chose to follow the wrong god. He is brought us nothing but fear, loss, and sadness. What of our sister? She's safe now, with the priest. Where is Freya? Escaped? The stranger. He may have saved Freya, but he doomed the rest of us. He was sent by God! He was sent by Loki! We have to let them know. You have to give Freya and the priest time to get further away. We should sacrifice ourselves for them? She has always been your weakness. The faith must survive. Where is he? You said he would be here. No doubt he has run off like a coward. He couldn't even move. Maybe it was a trick. He couldn't have gone far. Let's find him! Heavenly Father give us strength in our faith to overcome the heathens. Heavenly Father give us strength in our faith to overcome the heathens. Bishop! Where are you hiding him?! Heavenly Father give us strength in our faith - to overcome the heathens. - Gudrun! Are you in there?! Heavenly Father give us faith. Heavenly Father give us faith. - Heavenly Father give us... - Bishop! Send him out, or I burn your church to the ground! Cowards! Turn and face us! Run! Run! Get him! What are you waiting for? Where's your god now, witch?! I know this place. You will be safe here until you recover. Agnir will bring you food and water. She will heal you. Rest. Drink, drink. Drink, drink. Drink. My lord, what have I done? You lied to my face, Agnir. You have betrayed the earl. You will have to be punished. No, no, no, I've done nothing. Agnir, you can save yourself from a painful death. I don't like to do this, but we must bring the stranger to pay for what he has done here. So tell me where he is, then all of this will be over. Olav, cut his flesh, and make him talk. Blacksmith. They found out that Agnir was helping you. They have him tied up at the village square. And they took your gold. That is unfortunate. I thought you might need this. Ah, Grim, I missed you. You've been a busy little man, Blacksmith. The life of a blacksmith is always busy. Where have you been? Delivering axes. To who? There's nobody down there in that part of town, Blacksmith. Do you want to be hanging there next to your friend? You've been delivering weapons to ghosts. Don't take the earl for a fool. Where is the stranger? Stranger. You work for the earl. Remember? That's where you're wrong. You are a fool. Just give up, Stranger. Blacksmith! I will have your head on a spike! You snake. You wouldn't kill an unarmed man, would you? Odinsson! A lot of death has been seen through these eyes. Let's make a deal. I have silver, gold. I have lands. I will grant you a homestead. You have something that belongs to me. Yes. I'll give you everything you want. Why is it that when cowards face certain death, they grovel and become less than a knave? You will not be going to Valhalla, and you will not be feasting with Odin any time soon. This is for my father you killed! I may have overstayed my welcome. The town is yours. Belongs to no god. Thank you, my prince. I knew it. I knew you weren't just a stranger.
