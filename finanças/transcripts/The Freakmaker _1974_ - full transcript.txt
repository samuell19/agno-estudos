(Ominous rumbling) (eerie music) (jazz music) (ominous soundscapes) this is not a flower, however much it may resemble one It is an animal...with several characteristics that normally one would expect to see only in plants and we all know how carnivorous plants that behave like animals... such as this insect eating specimen, the Sundew plant the leaves of this remarkable plant are covered with numerous hairs, tipped with sticky glands leaves bend and curl around the insect caught on the sticky tips, completing it's entanglement then the glands exude a digestive substance, enabling the plant actually to absorb material from the insects body The Venus Fly Trap is an extraordinary example of predatory plant it's leaves fold rapidly when hairs of the inner surface are touched by an intruding insect many small digestive glands are scattered on the inner surface of each jaw the jaws of the leaf are edged with interlocking teeth, which form a cage when closed, to prevent the insect from escaping once triggered by the tension in the leaf tissue, the glands begin to work, causing the insect to be ingested, and absorbed The Cobra Plant is another unique example of natural mutation Small insects are lured into the mouth of the plant by the secretions of nectar glands on the surface of the leaf the captive continues through a glassy zone finally to become enmeshed in a area of downward pointing hairs, which serve to complete the entrapment of the lured creature subsequent digestion occurs from the simultaneous action of bacteria, living within the plant, and juices secreted by the inner walls of the leaf give me some lights, please You may think you are normal, but you are all the product of mutations Your ancestors our ancestors were freaks! Who only survived because they were stronger than the other forms of life around them We don't know yet, how these mutations happen, but we do know that mutations can be... induced So that instead of endless accidental changes we may be able to create the mutations of our choice and change our species... or improve it -do the accidental changes you mentioned include fetally deformed babies? - The tragedy of fetally deformed babies should show you... what can happen when mutations are uncontrolled but think of the glorious creatures of the future to be induced by genetic manipulation The mysterious essence called Nucleic Acid theoretically can be blended to create new strains, new forms of life, or to recreate extinct forms of life within 10 years it is safe to say we shall be able to recreate through time frozen amino acid strains a living dinosaur! To walk the earth just as it did a million years ago Already, through cloning, we will soon be able to take one cell, from an individual, and from it produce 100 individuals! Identical with the cell's donor just think of having a... a hundred Einsteins! - Or Hitlers -or worse imagine having hundreds of him running around -we are interested in cloning, not in clowning aright that's all for the day, thank you (classroom chatter) "Living dinosaur"? the man ought to be writing science fiction - I think he's sexy -you're mad. totally flipped out -anyway who's coming to the airport with me tomorrow? They've asked me to pick up that full bright scholar guy from America - I can't make it -come afterwards tea, records, good stuff! - Super! what kind of tea are you talking about? You drink or whatever you want or whatever (laughing) -you wanna come? Well, we'll be there hey, maybe we can get high on his nucleic acids and there might be a hundred more like you -bye -see you later, bye -bye bye then -bye bye (footsteps) (crunching leaves) (ominous music) (mysterious music) (tense music) (woman screaming) (dogs barking) you said that you could help me when will you make me better, professor? I took my part of the bargain -have you? - Always! I've got something new for you professor so that you can prove what a great man you are (dogs barking) (car door closing) tell you what, I dunno we gotta buy some brand new...they gotta get some new bags for these things. Hey if we... Lynch: (yelling) get away from that! BURNS! Why won't you keep everyone away from my wagon?! Now watch that menagerie! Or I'll put you in an institution where you belong! Eh...My money, my show, my brains! What did you say Burns? Nothing! Ugly bastard! Now stay away from that wagon! (spooky music) (squealing and monstrous sounds) (calm soundscapes) (blood squirting) (engine revving) (ominous music) Lynch: professor (door opening) professor! Oh she's a fine specimen, Lynch I've seen her somewhere before... go on let's get her to the operating table (spooky music) nobody believes such things aren't possible in her vital cells, lies the mystery of all life and a solution to that mystery here...put this on (machine clicking) she's coming out of it if only you understood what this means what she represents you and I together we could accomplish...a miracle (screaming) (airplane engine humming) how will we recognize him? - Oh I bet on this one Brian Redford, United States Army Major forsakes full on military career to pursue biochemistry ...scholarship for post-graduate research with famous biochemist Professor Nolter -well you certainly seem to be following the career of our friend with more attention than you pay to your studies - look who's talking, you almost fell asleep in biochem yesterday afternoon -thank you where'd you get all this stuff anyway? I've read it in Times Magazine -and look -you're Brian Redford -right -hi, I'm Tony - Tony -and, uh, this is Lauren Bates -how are ya Lauren? Hedi Jensen -hello -how do you do? - Hi Hedi -we're your welcoming committee alright, car's outside how does it feel to be a celebrity? we even read about you in Time -yeah, well, that's yesterday's news cigarette? - No thank you -no small vices? - No, nothing small... (car engine revving) (ominous music) now... let's see if we can reverse the process of fungus putrefaction with this orange (oscillating sound) so you see how our little experiment has worked result of an intense bombardment of rays from this newly developed form of psychotron and truly remarkable metamorphosis don't you agree, Mr. Redford? - Oh yes, I quite agree in fact I think the possibilities are fantastic - I assure you there is nothing of fancy in this the possibilities inherent in what you have just witnessed confound and surpass the most fecund fantasy my theory of total genetic is all embracing all living things are closely related and, uh, all matter is related isn't that right? - Yes sir I believe Einstein demonstrated something of the sort some time ago he did indeed advance that theory it was left to others to demonstrate it for instance imagine a new species composed of the characteristics of plants and animals use your imagination plants able to move in search of better conditions of light, soil, water animals able to harness the rays of the sun directly through photosynthesis absorbing nourishment through exposure to light a world without hunger a world left for peace and tranquility with time to develop our true human potential even though outwardly we might look like plants alright that's all for today thank you what you were saying in class you really believe that such a new species of plant-animal could come about? - Oh yes I'm convinced of it Lysenko believed that heredity could be changed in one generation I believe it can be changed in one day -a day? The secret lies in the DNA the amino acid which is the foundation of the all life forms look... why don't you come with me to my house, eh? I uh, I think that you will be interested Nolter: ...and all these protests, eh? Redford: especially the young people, there seems to be a general breakdown in respect for authority of course the young people are confused and angry food famine, population explosion they're facing extinction we scientists have an obligation to do something about it some of us are doing something not tomorrow but today! - Surely developing a species of plant-animal can only be in the distant future -that's not so distant as you imagine (laboratory equipment humming) (pulsating sound) it's enormous can hardly believe it they're the only ones in the world it's taken me years to develop them to this size as yet I haven't been able to get them to reproduce (laughing) -but it's still a long way from the idea of fusion of plant and animal I achieved this...10 years ago (pulsating sound) that's incredible (clicking tongue) regrettably (growling) this is necessary (screaming rabbit) (growling) -but isn't the feeding of a plant with animal protein contrary to your concept of it's getting it's nourishment from the atmosphere? - Yes, yes of course and that has to be the next step I have spent my life trying to achieve the synthesis of two life forms, Mr. Redford the creation of a new race of man with all the miraculous properties of a plant -create a new race of men, Professor? Uh ha, all in theory of course, it would take place through evolution -and you believe evolution can occur through a series of discontinuous jumps -oh, yes, yes of course by mutations also through a...creative process but we are on the verge of being able to accelerate the process of self-evolution -how? - By inducing such mutations what some people would to refer to as a... freak type (inside wagon) he's a freak too, he used to be in a show just like us had an act of his own they called him the "ugliest man in the world" well he's just as ugly inside as what he is outside -how did him and Burns even get together? Seems an unlikely team -some carnival they worked in together Burns had a bit of savings and put up the money -hmm, I suppose Lynch took over? He's giving the orders now I reckon him and Burns are up to something really nasty -well you helped him chase that girl the other day -you ought to be ashamed of yourself! - I told you, we did it for a laugh Burns said "we'll have some fun, we'll just scare her" like Big Pete would scare us sometimes just having some fun but it wasn't any fun watching Lynch grab her I didn't know he was going to be there really scared me! - I doubt these wild birds is a party to that sort of thing -maybe Lynch has got some holding room -what do you suppose Lynch did with that girl? - What do you think? No normal girl would give him the time of day so he catches one does what he wants when he's through she's too dead scared to tell anyone well he's making it dangerous for the rest of us he treats us bad enough anyway well I'm not getting into trouble working for somebody who does things like that and that new act he brought in, The Lizard Woman where did she come from? - I don't know but then she's not the first, is she? There were two others about a year ago in the show for a few weeks and then suddenly disappeared Burns said their family wanted 'em back didn't want 'em in a show like this after all -what new one? I saw her...when they brought her in she looked really bad real sickly he keeps them locked up too, away from the rest of us he shouldn't lock people up like that - I dunno, you shouldn't treat people the way he does anyway maybe we ought to have a talk with Burns about it -no use talking to Burns he'll close up, easier this will whatever it is (car whirring) that's something for Dr. Nolter -no, she'd be too young for him - I didn't even know those shows still existed anyway, it's probably a fake I don't know, it may be one of these mutations we were talking about -if he had his way, we'd all look like monkeys -stop it,Tony -wonder where Bridget can be? Yes, you invited her for tea and doesn't even turn up herself -wasn't at any of her classes today either maybe Dr. Nolter's theories have frightened her away? - Huh, I wouldn't put anything could frighten Bridget -no, I couldn't agree more -probably gone off for the weekend with some guy and forgotten all about you "tea party" (laughing) he's a brilliant man -who is? - Dr. Nolter he's a leading scientist in his field today - If we both mean the same Dr. Nolter, I think he's slightly barmy -people are always saying that about someone they don't understand -well, you don't really believe all that stuff about potent genetics he makes it sound like bad science fiction -what science can, and is doing today was once science fiction you're supposed to be a scientist yourself Tony why don't you act like one? - Look, as far as I'm concerned, to act like a scientist is to try to change for the better, the lot of mankind and not man himself I don't know whether Nolter is a madman or a genius or both but I think that ultimately he is wrong and he's dangerous (scoffs) anyway... I don't want to be turned into a vegetable (laughing) -there will always be Cabbages and Kings not several freaks anywhere guess he's right -actually a friend of mine told me that after being on an acid trip he said every bodies great big characters babe his face is gone -you're kidding -no (laughing) -yeah I know a guy who thought he was a a wild dog! A sort of animaloid human! - Born out of the unconscious racial genetic memory -(both) Carl Jung! - Said, heh, 30 years ago -what your professor Timothy Leary called the "wolf image"! (mallet hitting metal) (everyone) - awwwwwwww! Not bad for a limey -wooo! (mallet hitting, bell ringing, & yelling) -yay! - Good luck -well? - Right! - One...two... (mallet hitting metal) (bell rings) -wow, haha who said girls are the weaker sex? (laughing) -well I never said it -that's a rub for women's lib (indistinguishable chatter) -come on (carnival music) -see the never to be forgotten Alligator Girl! With scales all over her body! See the Monkey Woman! The missing link that survived from millions of years ago see her now right inside folks this way for your tickets see the Fire Eater from Borneo! See the incredible Popeye! The man who actually pops his own eyes right out of his skull! And the feature attraction of our show all the way from the roof of the world from the snow-capped Himalayas the Lizard Woman of Tibet! - You sure you want to see that stuff? - Oh yes, it'd be fun -well if it's half as good as he makes out, it'll be worth all of Brian's money -now wait a minute... welcome to the Burns and Lynch famous royal family of strange people this collection of human oddities and freaks is the greatest attraction of it's kind in the world now, without further ado here is our first unusual curiosity 35 years ago Dianne was born a normal girl at the age of twelve, a strange transformation began to take place after consultation with several specialists it was discovered the she was developing the characteristics of both sexes instead of becoming a normal young woman she was becoming virtually a brother and sister in the same body the Bearded Lady! (nervous laughter) thank you Dianne (clapping) this is Mary-Louise the world renowned Monkey Woman covered with long shaggy hair from head to foot and with three rows of teeth she is the foremost example of Darwin's Missing Link between ape and man her earliest anthropoid ancestor the unforgettable Mary-Louise the Monkey Woman! Sounds pretty hairy to me now another of our lovely assistants, Ms. Kathy Kitchen is bringing in Mr. George, the Human Pin Cushion 32 years old and never known a day's illness right? - That's right Mr. Burns I always feel fine what he means is he doesn't feel, full stop I noticed this ability as a very small child when my mother stuck me accidentally with a safety pin suddenly he got the point here is... the Frog Boy or the upside down man, depending on which way you look at him born with no calcium on his lower extremities he learned to get around like this, upside down here's how he met his girlfriend she dropped her handkerchief and he picked it up beginning of a new romance he even won a dance contest, hands down thank you (clapping) here he goes again, showing off (clapping) now it's time to present Ester Blackman known as the Alligator Skin Girl -well I was born in the state of North Carolina, born of normal parents I have one sister, three brothers born perfectly normal one brother which has passed away that was born in the same condition as I am with a very dry rough skin, covering the whole body which is known to medical doctors as ichthyosis skin but known now through the show world as The Alligator Skin Girl also known as the World's Strangest Mother yes I have been married and the mother of seven normal children now as well of being misfortunately not to have a clearer skin also not to have hair to grow upon the head yes ladies and gentleman, a truly remarkable human curiosity! (clapping) just one year ago Leslie was a voluptuous and beautiful airline hostess then she went on a crash diet and she never recovered today... she is the worlds only living example of a human skeleton (crowd gasping) and now our lovely assistant, Dolly! Bringing in our next attraction Mr. Hugh Bailey, The Pretzel Man Bailey will speak for himself -thank you ladies and gentleman, I don't sing or dance or do flip flops or anything like that I'm here because of the unusual condition, in which I was born now this is the shin bone bent like that both legs the same the knees are up here but they work alright -thank you Mr. Bailey now ladies and gentleman, we take great pleasure in presenting, the extraordinary, truly incredible, unduplicatable, the one and only attraction, known as: Popeye! (audience gasping) (nervous laughter) and it goes something, like this ...alright (screaming) ...that I recently invented back home in Chicago, sittin' all alone one day in my bedroom, you know, nothing to do, daydreaming, thinking of you of course eyeball twists in the last of the final portion ladies and gentleman goes like... (loud bang, screaming) (applause) thank you, Popeye! That concludes the main portion of our show ladies and gentleman, but now here is that, extra, added attraction you've all been waiting for from the refuse heap of evolution, the principle attraction of our show, The Lizard Woman of Tibet! Due to the high cost of bringing her to you, and because of the special care and feeding required, for this delicate creature, we're forced to impose a small extra charge ten pence only, for this particular exhibit and for those of you who have weak stomachs, our nurse, is again in attendance should you require any assistance - let's go before they con us on anything else -oh come on Tony, even if it's fake, let's look at it anyway -just look at them, they must have seen something horrible! - Come on -alright, if you want to be sick, let's go three and one half please hey isn't that the same medallion that Bridget was wearing? - Looks like it -there must be thousands of them where did you get that medallion? I would like to have one too - I manufacture them myself, lady um, sorry all sold out -what do you mean you're all sold out, you got a whole roll of tickets there - I know there are a lot of tickets left sir, ...but...there's, no more room in the house, sorry (scoffs) ...balls...come on (carnival music) you bloody fool -the little crook - I wonder why he wouldn't sell us any tickets -maybe there isn't any real Lizard Woman -anyway Dr. Nolter would find some of those people interesting examples of his theory -medallion still worries me it's the same as Bridget's! She's still missing ya know -don't worry, she's probably some place having a ball what are you doing here? - You must find me another subject -it's not that easy we have the show to take care of - let Burns look after that, you've got your own work to do that is if our agreement still stands -does it have to be another female? - No at this stage of the work, a man would do us well, or perhaps even better, but it must be, strong, healthy, good looking specimen -not like me, eh, professor? But you'll fix that, won't you? - Oh yes, Lynch yes, yes -what about the girl? Police might track them here - let her stay in the show It'll be less dangerous I promise you, nobody would recognize her now it's too bad we missed that phony Lizard Lady -you mean the Monkey Lady isn't real either? - Sure, she just doesn't shave for a while (laughing) -you're impossible, come on -goodnight -goodnight -bye (somber music) so now I'm going to dream about freaks tonight - like me for instance? - Of course (door unlocks) (relaxing music) (car engine revving) (spooky music) (light footsteps) (light footsteps) (flicking lighter) (creepy breathing) (scary demented music) (footsteps) (clicking) (faster footsteps) (running footsteps) (door opening) (carnival music) (demented music intensifies) (screaming) (calm music) (footsteps crunching) (tense music) (spooky jazz music) (door slams open) (striking sound) (demented music) (laboratory sounds) his cells and also my plants a new species at last an... an influenced mutation it's going to work this time it has to it has to work -and then you'll keep your promise and make it work for me? - Assuming neither human being nor plant but with the characteristics and advantages of both a plant that can move and think a man who can set down roots yes...that's all we can do for now we have to wait -for the right breed, how long do I have to wait? - I've told you when I... - I can't wait! Maybe there's no way to cure me and you just said that to keep me working for you -come with me, I have something to show you this is a new virus, I'm developing a mutation I hope it will, eh reverse the effects of your deformity yes, take a look your, eh, glandular disease (pulsating sound) (background chatter and music) (applause) - Mr. Burns... come on, next show (applause and cheering) (clapping) (laughing) (clapping) come on Kathy, light the candle oh uh, here you are I understand you're... (everyone singing "happy birthday to you") Mr. Lynch! Aren't you going to have a drink with us to help celebrate Kathy's birthday? - You expect me to sit down with a bunch of freaks? (record player stopping) -you won't have to sit, Mr. Lynch you may stand -yes, we don't mind if you celebrate with us, Mr. Lynch, do we? - No! he's one of us -yes, let's toast with that here's to Mr. Lynch! - We accept him -he's one of us! - Yes -our brother -shut up! - Our loving father - I'll make you sorry you were ever born! - Make us sorry we were ever born?

(glass breaking) (screaming) (yelling) (glass breaking - screaming) (obscured yelling) (tense silence) everything is ruined, ruined! - Never mind that dear, we'll have another party someday (in Lynch's head: "aren't you gonna have a drink with us to help celebrate Kathy's birthday?") (in Lynch's head: "Yes, we don't mind if you celebrate with us, Mr. Lynch?" ...) (in Lynch's head: "he's one of us!") (in Lynch's head: "yes, he's one of us") (in Lynch's head: "a loving father who looks after us") (in Lynch's head: "we accept him") (in Lynch's head: "and now presenting...") (in Lynch's head: "Mr. Lynch, the Ugliest Man in the World!") (in Lynch's head: "he's one of us") (in Lynch's head: "make us sorry that we were ever born?") (laughing) (in Lynch's head: "he's one of us") (in Lynch's head: laughing, repeating: "he's one of us") (footsteps) (door buzzer) (behind door: "who is it?") -you give dancing lessons -yeah come in (door creaking) so you're looking for some fun this evening? - You know why I'm here -well why don't you take off your hat and coat? Let's see what you look like underneath that hat of yours -no! I told you not -oh, don't worry you can stay I've seen all kind of things in this game you're a pretty one there, aren't you? Look, spend a little extra... and I'll be extra nice to you or shall I give it to you straight? Short and sweet... 2 pounds - I want you to say things to me -oh, I've got a nice selection of obscenities if that's what you want -no, nothing like that just tell me... just say... -oh come on love, I haven't got all night... What? - Just say... "I love you" -oh yeah... that'll be a pound extra "I love you" yes I know, but try not to worry bye now still no news of Tony, and Lauren has been calling his flat all day there's no answer! She even went around there -there's no need to panic he's only been gone for a day -but they always together and he would have called she hasn't heard a thing! It's so strange and Bridget it's over a week now since she disappeared - I never met her but I understand she wasn't exactly the disappearing type -right! something is wrong! I know it! - Look...I'm sure there's a logical explanation tell you what if Tony doesn't turn up by tomorrow then we'll notify the police Ok? How did she die? - Just died - like the others nah, she was breathing strangely and now all of a sudden she... anyway we've got to get rid of her - I'll take care of it (creepy music) (calm music) (body splash in the water) (pulsating sounds) (phone ringing) hello? (Tony on phone) -hello -who is it? (Tony on phone) Tony (Tony on phone) have to talk to you - Tony, I've been so worried about you why didn't you call? (Tony on phone) I have to talk to you (Tony on phone) see... -as fast as you can I can't wait to see you hurry darling! (phone ringing) (footsteps running down stairs) yes (Lynch on phone) Professor, the girl died (Lynch on phone) I dumped her in the river Lynch, I think I have succeeded but, he got away and there was a struggle you've got to find him, Lynch or bring me someone else (breathing heavily) (door buzzing) Tony? (muffled voice behind door) -yes, let me in (button clicking) (door unlocking) (footsteps approaching) darling? (screaming) (long terrifying scream) (short scream) (dog barking) (running footsteps approaching) (police knocking on door) (police) open up, open up! (police banging on door) (from behind door) police! (banging on door) I'm at 53 Lingley St. There's a woman here who's been screaming her head off she's now unconscious and could have been attacked, better get a doctor I'm going to search the flat, over and out -is there anything we can do? - Oh no thank you sir if you could just stay outside -sure thing it was some kind of a shock this sort of thing takes a very long time to come out of give her one of these every three hours and call me if there's any change -yes doctor -call back again later goodbye Mr. Redford -well goodbye doctor, thank you -she's just laying there like a zombie, look at her -you look as if you could do with a rest yourself it seems - I'm alright, but if there's any change please call the number I gave you - I will -take me home, Brian -goodnight nurse, see you in the morning poor child whatever she saw was real she wasn't dreaming and so terrifying that she closed her mind retreating from it -oh Brian, it's awful and she'd been so worried about Tony -that could have something to do with it -maybe something happened to him and she found out about it? Darling we have to find him, he's the only one who can help -well we can't do anymore tonight get some rest, I'll come around later (car engine revving) (spooky music) (creepy voices echoing) get back to your wagons I mean your cages! (switchblade clicking) what do you want, more money? Time to go on strike, eh? (laughing) he's no right to talk to us like that he treats us like animals -he's not better than we are -all right, stop all your grumbling now you've all got good homes here, you know it we're all family, one big happy family let's keep it that way! - Look Mr. Burns you're a decent man, you're not like him Lynch is the one we're after ticking off he's a cruel man he is -we've been treated poorly by the outside world we thought we'd have some kind of home here but we're still hated and we're still afraid -just remember, he's on our side really it's just us against all the rest of the world let's not fight among ourselves -then why do you hate him so much? (abrupt eerie music) I'm finished with it, finished with the whole business! - Not too loud - I don't care who hears! - You're in this as much as I am, or Nolter and don't you forget it! - Prove it! Now look...Lynch, we've had a good run in this place we've got a bit of money saved now or less get out while we can -we've been partners in every kind of thing, Burns come on Burns just this one last time Nolter said just one more and then it will be our turns -your turn! - He can make our glands work right make us normal! Don't you want to be normal Burns? - I don't want any trouble with the police! Now they must be investigating already first that young girl and then the young man both from the same university, both in the same week! - We've got to go, Burns they're easy and pretty -not after he gets through with them no, not this time! I... AM... LEAVING! Come along with the carnival if you want to, or you can stay here with Nolter (grunting) alright I'll go alone if you have the wagon leave it at Nolter's, pick me up or I'll kill you! (stomps floor) (monstrous sounds) (drunk incoherent singing) (seagulls singing overhead) (ominous sounds) (screaming) no!! (agonizing screams) Brian, I'm scared! I can't sleep! (Brian on phone) That's not like you - I don't feel like me everything's unreal, it's like I'm on a bad trip or something (Brian on phone) alright, try and relax (Brian on phone) I'll be right over, ok? - Please...and hurry! (monstrous sounds) (splashing water) (monstrous sounds) (banging sounds) Hedi, it's me, Tony - Tony... -don't come any closer! I've changed you mustn't see! - Tony... (grunting) no control! (heavy breathing) ...my brain write down what I say Nolter... experimenting... human beings and... not human must...get Nolter (door buzzer) (grunting) Tony! (door buzzing) Brian? (intense music and screaming) (calm creepy music) (intense creepy music) (car skidding) (creepy music) Hedi? Hedi? (monstrous breathing sounds) they'll be looking for her in the morning -they won't find her I'm almost there and this one, won't get away (tires screeching) (dogs barking) (dog barking intensifies) go see who it is, go on get rid of them we don't want to take any chances of being interrupted not now... (vicious dog barking) (gate slams) why didn't you ring the bell? It would have been much easier, don't you think? - Where is she? - Who? - You know damn well who (dogs barking - kicks and punches landing) (punching and grunting) (knife sticking) (scary music) Lynch: get back! Get back!! Stay away from me! Get back... you freaks! Get back you freaks!! Don't you hear me?! Get back! - No! Don't you hear me?! Why don't you get away? Get away! Ugh! Don't you understand I want to... don't you understand I want to live?! (indecipherable screaming) (knife sticking) (dogs barking) (dogs mauling - Lynch screaming) Mr. Bur... (grunting and screaming) (deathlike screams) (dogs barking, screaming) (laboratory sounds) (creepy music) (glass shattering) (intense music) (screaming) (fire blazing) (creepy music) (fire burning and dogs barking) (tense music) (fire rumbling) (crackling mutant skin) (metal clanking) (sparking sounds) (mutant-plant shrieking) (lumber falling) (coughing) (dogs barking) Brian... -it's ok, it's ok, shhhh it's all over now (uplifting music) you know something?
