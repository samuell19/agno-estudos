The Master of Dance based upon the story by Jozef Korzeniowski Yes. It's the same tenement. Please forgive me, for arriving in such a manner, but there... you must learn not such distinct manners. I think that... Naturally, I’m accustomed to that. Please, come. Please... Maybe you would like to sit? Then, it was a similar evening, like today, but... No, please, I’m sure. it’s very interesting story. Would you like to smoke? - Oh, so that’s what you smoke today. Maybe you’d prefer a cigar? - No, no, thanks, I’ll try this new one. I’ve heard about your interests... there... Among us. They talk well of you. So if you want... So... It was in October... In the year... never mind. The evening was awfully windy, like today. Gosia, please take these glasses. Gentleman! Cheers for the poet! Viva, poet of the poets! Viva! Bravo! Thank you, brothers! Thank you, children of art and poetry! Darlings of glory! By the grace of glory, which will pour upon me, all the majesties will fade away! Let us drink to my name! Until my hairline recedes, until my hair becomes grey! Get him up! Let’s go. Look. How carefully she listens to him, how cheerfully she looks upon him. You’re charming! Charming! It was only a month ago, when she said to me that fortune and glory are a peak, which won’t mislead her. I thought she loved me. And then the old man came with his titles and fortune. And she turned her back on me, because I had for her only my heart and fidelity. She promised me! Forgive me. I have to say goodbye now. It’s time for me. Can you see? Such a good man. But what will happen to those poor children? She’ll marry another and... God had mercy upon my soul and sent an illness to the old man. Don’t say it, because it’s a sinful thought. I don’t know what to wish for, and what to desire. You’ll be mine at last! His pulse is stronger! It’s a good sign. Enough! Don’t you want to go ahead? I don’t want to! And I won’t go! It’s not the time. - The time, for what? Strange. Once again too late. Yes. So young! The attack lasted only a few minutes, and she was gone. I’m curious about the reason. Her family never said she was ill. What a day. In the same tenement. We all have to die. I was so often... He came here every day. Maybe he was ill? You know, how these students are: they don’t eat, but drink too much, and there’s a tragedy... No excuses! These students... I've sent for a carriage. Sir, come to your senses, we’ve got to take the body! Such a scandal in my shop, such a scandal! You’re only talking about your shop, and I’ve lost my lovely wife! Sir, maybe it will hurt you, but I’ll tell the truth: your wife brought you nothing but misery! Just look at you! Those patches on your rags! I’m the one who should cry, Sir, I’ve lost my best client! Yes? So it's like that? Sir, what are you doing? Calm down! I’ll strangle you! Help me! Now, go to sleep. I’ll come for you later. Who are you? Don’t you see? I’m the Master of Dance! The Dance, which everyone has to dance! I come for you when you expect it least. And when you least give it thought. Don’t do as they have done, so I’ll come when you are prepared. Good night, Sir. From that day on... it was many years until I... What? You know what. Through all those years, when I passed by a tenement, which so much resembled the one where I came with that stranger... Each time I relived that experience. Each time I asked myself: am I prepared. To dance. It could happen... any day. And eventually... he called me. But that tenement... It disappeared. Yes. Another building stands there now. A new one. I’ll show you. In a moment. It is... What's wrong? My time is up. Forgive me. My hat. Upon Wisla river the Warsaw day is dawning, And through the streets it’s Warsaw day dawning! Once again let’s go to school, Once again let’s go to office, It’s Warsaw day which hurries to work! To hare away, Until your last breath, For your capital city which is first in your heart! Yet once more singing Warsaw day dawning, Our hard-working Warsaw day dawning!
