FAMOUS MUSIC CONDUCTOR, KU SHU LAM, IS COMING TO HONG KONG Hey, it's time to go to the airport! What are you holding? Time to go to the airport! Yes, let's go! Is she crazy or what? The poster is ruined. The word "Ku" still visible though. Why isn't Syun Suk Ping here? That... Toothpick is busy arranging for your press conference. How do you know his nickname? Your nickname is Chopsticks. Because chopsticks are made of wood and your name literally means jungle. What else do you know? I know that chopsticks are used to pick up food while toothpicks are used to pick out the food remains. Stop! Don't touch my precious sword! All right. You're a music conductor. Why do you own a sword? I'm good at using both the baton and the sword. You're a famous conductor. I bet your baton must be very outstanding. Show it to me! I only show it when I perform. Actually, I admire you very much. I have your poster. The one which you're holding a baton. You look so majestic in it. Can you please sign it for me? Driver, pull over! We haven't reached the destination. Mr. Ku, what are you doing? I'm going there by myself. Can I hitch a ride? Sorry, there's no spare room! Excuse me. See you later. Mr. Ku! You stop walking after every few steps. Of course, I'm pregnant! With this pace, we can never get home. What are you laughing at? Haven't you seen a pregnant lady? -I'll slap you, you little rascal. -I'll leave now. Please don't do that. He's looking at you! We need this. Let's buy a karaoke machine. What's wrong? -It hurts. -What's wrong? -It hurts so much. -Are you giving birth now? -Yes! -What should I do now? Help! She's giving birth. -Help me! -Bring some hot water please. -Hey. -Don't touch my stomach. I'm one touch away from delivering the baby! Help! She's giving birth. Don't just stand there! Hurry up! She's giving birth! -Hurry up! -Hurry up! What are you looking at? You are so inhumane. Don't just stand there. Help us! All of you are so inhumane! Darling, are you okay? -It hurts so much. -Really? -Yes. -Do you feel better? -Hurry up! -Hurry up! Excuse me. Step aside. -She's giving birth. -Really? Call the ambulance! No need. It's just a false alarm. You told me you were going to give birth. -It's just a false alarm. -Are you serious? Of course, we are serious! I wouldn't want her to give birth in public. How about I ask your wife to give birth in public? Let's go. You're insane. -Nothing to see here. -Please leave the scene. Hurry up. Get down the car. -It's mine! -It's mine! -Stop fighting! -Stop standing in my way! Let's go. Zong Yok! Zong Yok! -Zong Yok. -Are you here for money again? Of course not! I brought you something good. -That's too good to be true. -Yes. Fellow colleagues, I have some good stuff for you. If you want something cheap yet good, follow me. -Come on, you won't regret it. -Come on! -What's so good? -Of course! The original price is 100 dollars. I'm selling it for 80 dollars now. I owe you 500 dollars, right? This CD player is worth more than 1,000 dollars. It's definitely a deal! -Did you steal it? -Don't defame me! My friend sold them to me cheaply because he's quitting his job. And I'm selling them to your colleagues at a fair price. Hey, please... Please take care of my sister. I'll give you a discount. Look at this. -Big sister, this one. -Who's your sister? You are my sister. -Look at this-- -Does your mom know you're outside? Yes. She knows about it. From 100 dollars to only 30! It's definitely a good deal! Have a look. Dear fellow colleagues, it's unbelievable that we are selling these stuff cheaply! Check it out even if you don't plan to buy anything. What's so good? We have many kinds of goods. They are all cheap and durable! -Let's go see. -Can I come too? Of course! It's for everyone. Hurry up! -Over there! -Over there. Here, this way. Hurry up before they're sold out! You can request for a new room if you don't like it. I don't have to pay for it anyway. Come over here. This is the study room. The kitchen and dining room are over there. The bedroom is across the hall. Give room service a call when you're hungry. I don't have to pay for them as well. I'll have to pay for this though. -Thank you. -Thank you. I'm sorry. I gave you an extra note by mistake. This bed is big enough for you to do anything you wish! It has been ten years since you came back here. Do you need any special services? I'm a vegetarian now. Even though you're a vegetarian, you'd still need it. Do you like this room? The room is kind of nice. It's very quiet here. I'll go get the door. Hello! Hello! Do you recognize him? -Yip, long time no see. -Indeed. -Is this your younger brother? -I'm his wife. She's a woman. I've totally forgotten about Blind-man. Hello, Chopsticks! Long time no see. How do you do? -Hey, Blind-man! -Hello! Has Blind-man become completely blind? Somehow, he doesn't see himself as a blind man. You seem better after shaving. I'm Toothpick. Chopsticks is over there. Hello, Chopsticks! How are you? You look great! The girls are here. I'll go get the door. Your help is not needed. Don't you remember that you're blind? -Hey, Jumbo! -Hey. I'm coming in. Hello, Chopsticks! I haven't seen you for over a decade! You're in good shape! You were talking about chickens? Yes, I brought these chickens just for you. That's great! It's very hard to find home-bred chickens in Hong Kong nowadays. We have another guest. Let me open the door. You're a blind man. Stop wandering around. Have a seat. Sit still. Chewing Gum. How are you? Long time no see! Are you alone? Hurry up! -This is my wife, Jenny. -Hello. This is my sister-in-law, Jacky, my younger son, Jimmy and my eldest son, Johnny. This is my youngest son, Joey. This is my mother-in-law, Judy. This is my dog, Bobby. This is my brother-in-law also called Bobby. -Hello. -This is his girlfriend. What's your name again? -Jody. -Jody. -I told you to stop doing that. -You're known as a playboy. What happened to you? He accidentally swallowed the gum. Now it's inside his intestines. Dad, the baby's hungry. -Where's the milk? -I'm coming. -Seriously? -Beware of the chicken! Beware! I can't handle it. -Oh no! -It made my shirt dirty! -Watch out of the chicken! -Got it! Please take care of my baby. I'll get the milk for him. Let's play a round! Since everyone is here. Let's play mahjong. -I want to join the game. -You're blind. How do you play? I can feel it with my fingers. -Hey, you! -I can play better than you. -Someone look after my dog, please. -Count me in for mahjong! Can someone please take care of the chicken? -Please look after the dog. -Hey! Hold the chicken! I've never been so happy for a decade. How long will you be here? For a month? -Yes. -That's great! We can party every night. No! We'll party once in two days. Hold it. It's a gift for you. I'll go play mahjong. We have to attend a press conference soon. I'll just play for two rounds. I'm coming! FAMOUS MUSIC CONDUCTOR, KU SHU LAM, IS COMING TO HONG KONG Miss, what are you doing here? I'm waiting for someone. Are you kidding me? What are these? Where are the pastries? Sorry, sir. We don't serve pastries in cocktails. I love pastries. I told you to prepare pastries. I'll order some pastries for you. -Excuse me, sir. -Well, for about a month... -Excuse me, thanks. -You can't choose. -Mr. Ku, I would like to ask about-- -Excuse me. Please queue up. Excuse me, Mr. Ku. I told you to queue up! Mr. Ku, you've been to so many places. Which place do you like the most? -Let me fix my shoelaces. -I think it's India. What makes India so interesting? I like the food. Mr. Ku, where will your next stop be? I'll go to Australia -and Japan. -Fellow reporters, are you done asking questions? -Not yet. -There is a guy with glasses. Do you mean me? It's your turn to ask. Ask now. -It's my turn? -Yes. Mr. Ku, have you eaten? Not yet. I see. What a brilliant answer. Thank you. What's wrong? I was concerned about him. You all keep asking him questions, don't you think he'd be hungry? Right? Let's have some snacks. -Let's go. -I'm waiting for my pastries. Mr. Ku. I have one more question. What happened to your trousers? Oh no! What did you eat? Why is it black? Black-bone chicken. Mr. Ku, I suggest that you go back to your room to clean it up. I'm volunteering to clean it for you. No need. Don't just hold his sword. Hold on! Can you help me? Someone is after me. Can I hide in your room? Why don't you call the police? Looks like you haven't visited Hong Kong for a long time. Even the Chief Commissioner got robbed. Please, I'm begging you. Otherwise, I'll be in big trouble. Please. You live alone, right? Yes but most of my friends are here. -What should I do? -What do you mean? What a mess. Come in. Blind-man? Yip? Blind-man? Where did all of them go? Is anyone home? Is everyone gone? Have a seat. I need to change my trousers. Sure. What are you doing? Thank you for your help. You deserve a reward. The reward is me. See! -Hey! -Are you crazy? -Hurry up! Take a photo! -What are you doing? What are you doing? -Stop it! -Hold his leg! Hey! -Stop it! -Hold him tight! -Hurry up! -Stop taking photos! Don't let him touch you! -Why are you taking photos? -What are you doing? You are being framed. If you want the photos, you need to pay 30,000 dollars. It's 30,000 dollars. Are they going to capture me? They have us in the photos. Stop running! Don't let them escape! They took my photos! Go away! They've taken my photos. We'll take photos for you too. Go away! You are hopelessly poor, so work harder! Harder! Why bother fixing an old car? Just blow it up! I'll work hard! I'll work until I stop breathing. I'm dying. Over here! -Where is Zi Git? -He's inside. Take it. It's not enough. -Not enough? -No. Go away! Your sister is here. I don't care. Send her away! You rascal! Shut up, bitch. Come out! No way! Come out now! -Are you okay, Zi Git? -You're murdering me. -I'm as good as dead. -Are you okay? Zi Git. -How do I lift it? -It hurts. Hang on there! Let me pull you out. What's going on? My leg is broken. It hurts! You rascal! You always locked me up, you bitch. -Now it's payback time. -Let me out. -It's done. What should we do now? -Open up! -You fool! Let's go have fun. -Do you want to die? -Let's go! -Open the door! Open the door! Last night, I dreamt about a strange guy. He taught me a movement called Speedy Hands. This only happened in a second. Opening the pocket, grabbing the wallet, then closing the pocket. -Do you know how long is a second? -Tick-tock! Hilarious! See, it's gone! You fool! Teach us! -I don't teach, we'll just try it. -Okay. Remember the guy with a mustache? What now? Let me demonstrate it to you. Pretend that you tripped. Tripped? No, it's not pretty at all. You'll look pretty if you fall down with your lipstick on. -Really? -He'll move aside, then I can... -He's right. -All right. I'll time it for you. No need! It only takes a split second! You're getting the hang of it. -Let's do it. -Okay. Do it now! Stop using the lipstick. You're pretty enough. Hurry up! Sorry, it's too crowded over here. Please go to the other side. Goodness! She fell down because of you. How can you leave just like that? -It hurts. -How could you do that? It's all your fault. You didn't fall properly. Go home and sleep! He didn't move at all. -You! -Yes? Go there and flirt with him. -It's so embarrassing. -Go! -You can do it! -Do it! -Hurry up! -Okay. Mr. Mustache, how do you read this? Big boobs. Hey! -What are you doing? -Help! -Stop it! -Stop him! -Quick, run! -Run! -Run for your life! -Don't let him run! -Don't let him escape! -Don't let him escape! -Come over here. -Here. -Come over here. -Come get it. -It's you again. -Go get it. -Give my wallet back! -Come on. -Aren't you the reporter? -Come on! -Give me the pictures! -Come on! Don't you want your wallet back? It's not fun at all. What pictures? What can you do to me? -Will you give them or not? -Mr. Mustache. -Give them to me. -Sorry, it's not with me. Good morning, Zong Yok. Let me introduce you to someone. Run for your life! -Hey! -Let's go. Catch! Wait for me, Zi Git! I'm still here! Enough. Give me back my wallet. Take it. If you lay a finger on me, I'll scream for help. Go after her! Come over here! You're dead anyway. Come over here if you dare. There's a junction in front. Let's trap her. Hey, pretty girl. -Don't come any closer. -I just want my wallet. -Help! He's molesting me! -Give back my wallet! -Get over here now! -Give back my wallet! -Help! -Give back my wallet! Help, Zi Git! Stop! Freeze! Stop the engine, step down and show me your license. Are you kidding me? Why is the fare so expensive? It wasn't that far. Exactly. Why is it so expensive? -I'll go in first. -Okay. Miss. It's calculated with the meter. I don't know if you had adjusted the meter! Hello, sir! My name is Madonna. I'm looking for my daughter, Philadonna. -Please have some tea. -Can I have these? Hello, sir! -Please have some tea. -I'm looking for someone. Forget about it then. Hey. Can I have some? What? Hello, everyone! You all must have been working hard. -Let's have some tea and cookies. -There's tea. -Make yourselves at home. -Mom. I'm here. -Mom. -Don't worry. I'll handle it from here. Sir, don't charge her. She's not a runaway child. Sir, have some tea. -Have some cookies. -Have some tea. Is your mom a baker? Yes, I'm the boss of St. Madonna Cake Shop. We have over a hundred branches located at Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, USA, Canada, and Europe. As for your daughter-- What happened to my daughter? This man claimed that your daughter stole his wallet. What? Mr. Mustache. My daughter would never steal your wallet. -Help yourself. -Don't let her have it. It must be your brother. Her brother is a bad influence. -That's right! Sue her! -Hey! Please get the facts right! Your daughter is a bad influence to my brother. -What? -That's a fact! Can you believe it? My daughter is like a princess. It's impossible that she's a bad influence. Show some respect. Money is not everything. -So, you're going to flip the table? -Yes! Please calm down. Let us handle this. Chopsticks! What's going on? -You're just in time. -What did you do? Molesting? Which girl? He claims that my daughter has stolen his wallet. How is that possible? Mom, I was just playing with him. She's still young and it's just a joke. You have daughters too, right? Yes, he's got a bunch of girls. Just like his name, Chopsticks. He's born to pick up girls! I'm not married. However, his "little brother" is very naughty. Your daughter ought to be more careful. Who are you? I'm the manager of HK Art Group. This is my name card. I'm his manager. I'm glad you're here. The little girl claims that your friend molested her. Molest? Why did you molest my daughter? She stole my wallet. She said I molested her when I tried to take it back. Mom, it's just a joke. This is more than just a joke. If you want to have fun, just tell me. I have so many department stores and bakeries. I can make an arrangement for you to shoplift in our own stores. That won't be fun! My baby... How do you teach your daughter? -John! -Hello, Madonna. What's going on? It's just a joke. It's not true. Your daughter stole someone's wallet. That's impossible. My daughter is not a thief. Do me a favor. I'll return the pictures to you. Whose wallet did she steal? Nothing happened. It was just a joke. Why are you defending her? Although her mom is bad at teaching her, she deserves a second chance. Everything is fine. Madonna, you can bring your daughter home now. Let's go home. Thank you for the help. Bye. -Can we leave now? -Yes. Ms. Kam. What is it? Can you ask your brother to return the pictures to me? What pictures? Well, the other day, he and his friends set me up. They even took my photos. What a rascal! I'll try my best. Isn't she gorgeous? You're a vegetarian, right? I don't think you're interested in her. She's mine now. Yes, I remembered. -Both of you go home first. I need to go. -Take care. Let's go. Ms. Kam, where are you going? I can send you. I'm good. I have my own ride. That's great. I don't have a car. Please let me hitch a ride. Boss, are you okay? Why don't you give it a try? I told you not to take the risk. See what happened to you? I didn't expect her to be so fierce. Who's fierce? -I-- -Nothing. Let's go. Did you hurt yourself? He's fine. Let's go. What a pervert. You deserve to be blackmailed. Did you just call me a pervert? Hey! Don't you know what your brother did? Enough. You don't have to say it out. I'll get the pictures. She's too tough to handle. You want to try her? She'll choke you to death. Let's go! Hello? Hello? Is this Mr. Ku? You don't have to know my identity. You're a public figure. Of course you don't wish to see the photos being spread. Give me 30,000 dollars then. What? You don't get it? It means 30,000 dollars in cash. You fool! Right now, you-- Zong Yok! -What a rascal! -Zong Yok! -Trying to blackmail people? -Hey! -Stop it! -Are you asking for a death wish? It's so embarrassing. You would feel embarrassed? Hey. He's cool, isn't he? Okay, we're done with this. Today, you'll have your meal. Let's move on to section 39. Hey! Hey! How long will it take? I'm in a rush. Don't make a noise. The pictures are here. Want it or not, it's up to you. Ms. Kam. What is it? Thank you. Be careful next time. I won't let history repeat itself. How do I know? Are you free next Saturday? Would you like to come to my concert? You call that music? It's awful. You don't have to listen to it, just watch me perform. It's not good either! Why don't we go to karaoke tomorrow? Sure. Hey, Specky! How can I reach you? Write down my hotel's phone number. It's 524... Help! He robbed me! Robbery! -Stop! -Don't move! Thank you so much! -Robbery! -Stop! -Robbery! -Stop! Hey! Are you okay? -It hurts. -What? -It hurts. -Where? You're stepping on me. It hurts! It hurts! You should have told me earlier. Please close the door. Have a seat. I need to cook for my brother. You treat your brother so well. Hey, do you want coffee? Sure. Thank you. -Ju Lam, don't call-- -It's not much. -Close the door! -Fire! -How to-- -Here comes the fortune. Here to report I have found an army! Enjoy the coffee. The TV is on the blink. Zi Git broke it. Excuse me, Mr. Mustache! Move aside! Move aside, Mr. Mustache! Hey, move aside! I want to watch TV, not you. Hey, move to the other side. That side. Mr. Mustache. Do me a favor. That's not the right way. Bring me a spoon. A spoon. Hurry up! Hurry up! -Thanks! -Time to eat. Rice with roasted goose and barbecue pork. Thank you Zong Yok. What's wrong with you? Why do you lock your brother up? You won't understand. He always messes things up. He would be arrested soon or later. It's better for me to lock him up, instead of the police. My sister treats me well. She lets me watch TV and listen to music. She also gives me some candies at times. -You talk too much. -Right, Zong Yok? Drink your water! He's a cunning person. He could run away if I didn't watch over him! He's behind bars now. There's no way he can escape. You're wrong. If you give him a spoon, he can dig a hole and escape. That's why we had to use plastic spoons now. Get back there. His clothes were so dirty and I had to wash it! You're so strange. Sometimes you treat him so well and sometimes you scold him badly. You won't understand because you don't have a younger brother. He's been naughty since young. He refuses to study. He always hangs out with the other naughty kids. I didn't even have the chance to study. Why? Forget about it. I'm his sister after all. Actually he's not that bad. He's just playful. You need to teach him patiently. Do you think I don't have to work? I work from morning till night. I don't have the time to teach him. Unlike you, I don't earn big money just by performing. I'm not that lucky. Help me. It's not that dirty. Baby, you always complain that I don't spend enough time with you. I have a good idea. I have found a way to talk to you all the time. Mom, will you stop playing mahjong? I need entertainment at times. Time for mahjong. Are you ready? I'm coming! Mom, you said you'd spend time with me. Watch TV if you're bored. Be good. I love you. -What took you so long? -Hurry up! I was busy with my baby. -Have you rolled the dice? -Yes, we got nine. I see. Take a card. Let's play. Hello, my baby! We can see each other now. You can call me if there's anything. You know right, my baby is very clingy. She wants to see me all the time. Your daughter is so pretty. Of course, like mother like daughter. -Miss, where are you going? -Why are you here? I'm here to guard you. Why are you following me? This is my home, not a prison. Please don't run! Miss, please don't run. I can't catch up with your pace. Mom! Baby, what's wrong? I'm here. Baby, why did you call me? What is it? -What's wrong? -Nothing's wrong. Where are you going, baby? I'm going back to prison. After this game, it will be 24 rounds. Do you still want to continue? Of course! I'll play until morning comes. That's great! -Ma'am. -What's wrong? Your daughter is missing. I've looked for her, but she's nowhere to be seen. What? -Wait for me. -Okay. Hey, where did you keep my daughter? Your daughter is not with us. It's all your brother's fault. He is a bad influence to my daughter. -Please step aside. -Hey, I will report this to the police. -Don't stand in my way, Fatty. -I'm here to look for my daughter. I went to your brother's workplace. I was told that he's absent today. You surely know where he is as you're his sister. Hey, do you hear me? Are you pretending to be deaf? You're just like your brother. Both of you are bad people. I'll sue you. Where are you going? I'm talking to you. Why are you lifting me? Let me down! Hey! Help! Let me down! -What's wrong? -Help! -A fatty is singing up there. -Did she ask for it? -Yes. -Help! Follow me. He's up there. Hey! Where are there so many stairs? Walk faster! Please close the door. I have locked up my brother. It's impossible for him to kidnap your daughter. Zi Git! Goodness! -Rascal! -He must have had kidnapped my daughter! Zi Git! Zi Git! Zi Git! You didn't put the phone down properly. That's why I couldn't reach you. -It's you. -Where is Zi Git? How do I know? -What are you looking at? -It's not your kind of thing. Let me have a look. It's not for you. It's perverted stuff. -Let me have a look. -It's not for you. -Where is it? -It's there. -I see nothing. -It's there. I see it! I see it as well. -What are you looking at? -The same thing as you are. Pervert! Then why are you looking? I'm only peeking on women. Her figure is bad. I'm not interested. Take it. -What are you reading? -It's just a comic. Let me have a look. You're a grown-up yet you're still reading a pornographic comic. You're right. That doesn't make sense since there is a woman in front of me. -What are you doing? -I'm about to do many things. -Someone is trying to molest me! -I'm just kidding. Stop shouting! Shut up! Otherwise, I will rape you. Someone is trying to rape me! Hey! -Stop it! -Let me go! -Help! -Stop it! Don't do that! -Help! -Stop it! -Stop beating me! -Help! I was just kidding. Go away! -Go away -Stop beating me! -Help! -Please stop! What happened? Zi Git! -What's wrong? -He tried to rape me. He what? Glad that you're back. Glad? Go to hell! -I won't do that again. -How dare you... You rascal! Let me hit you to death. Let me hit you to death. Why don't you rape the oven? Philadonna, let's go. What are you doing? Hush now! We're here for revenge! You scolded my mom at the police station and she scolded me in return. You gave me a spoon and I ran away from home. You knew that I would run away from home if I get scolded by my mom. You knew I'd be homeless after running away from home. You knew that I would be helpless without my mom. You said that she deserved a second chance. We're giving you a chance to give us a second chance. -You have to take care of us. -Let's start with ten dollars. Sure! It's more than ten. You better leave before I call the police. -Beat him! -I can't reach him. How dare you? -Cover me! -Hang in there! We're rich! Go to hell! The Buddha's Palm? That's considered molesting! You little-- I'm scared! That's cool! What swordsmanship is that? The Lady's Sword. Go away! -Master. -Master. We're willing to do anything for you. However, the accommodation is on you. It's you. Why are you here? Do you know that your brother has escaped? I know. He won't be this lucky next time. What are you doing? I'm making a cage to lock him up, so that he can't escape next time. Are you serious? Hey. Do you know that it's illegal to lock up a person? If I don't lock him up, he will commit a crime someday. How do you know that my brother has escaped? He came to me just now. Really? Where is he now? I'll capture him. He left. Rascal! Please tell me the next time you see him. Sure. I have to go. Please close the door. I told you to lock the front door, not this door. Please open the door for me. The key is on the side table. Okay? -That is the key. -See you tomorrow. What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Where are you going? You always lock up your brother. You should have a taste of it. Hey, come back! You're crazy! Don't think that you can lock me up. I can burn the bars down. Hey, let me out! Hey! Hey. Eat up. I don't want to eat! Why are you so fierce? Imagine if you're locked up. Now you know the feeling. Then why did you lock your brother up? Your brother needs to be taught with patience and love. Being fierce alone doesn't work. It's none of your business. Since it's none of my business, I'll leave now. Please don't go. Let me out. With a condition. Promise me that you won't lock your brother up anymore. Okay. Let me out. A deal is a deal. Hurry up. -Where is the key? -Take it. Promise me that you won't lock your brother up anymore. Got it. Hey! It's your turn now. Sorry, I gave you the wrong key. I think this is the right key. Stop messing around. Mr. Ku, your friends are having a party inside. They're also performing an opera. The Lady's Sword. -Strike! -Strike! Stop messing with my sword. We're practicing The Lady's Sword. It's a real sword. You might get yourself killed. -Where is Zi Git? -He's inside. Call him Master. -Master. -Master. Don't mess with my flute. I don't know that it's a flute. Raise your hand. I learn it from my Master. It's called Dancing Dragons. Let me show you another one. It's called Follow the Flow. Don't get any closer. -You rascal, what did you do? -Stop beating me! -Look at you! -It's not my fault! -How is that not your fault? -Hey! -Can you both stop fighting for once? -She beat me, Master. Hey! What's wrong with you? Isn't it nice? It's quite nice. I drew it. Does it look similar to me? You rascal! Master, help me! Get out now. I'm playing the Dreadful Melody. You'll get injured by the melody. Hey! Stop messing with my zither. It's an antique. No wonder it looks so old. The music scores are useful! Get out! Go. Get out! Hurry up. Leave now! Come here. -We're not that close. -Am I right? I tried to teach him with love and patience, but he still messes things up at the end. You can't treat them any nicer. -Are you referring to me? -Shut up! Come with me. Enough! -Master. -Master. We're playful. We're sorry. Please give us another chance. -Please give us a chance. -Please give us a chance. Master! -Master! -Master! -Please give us a chance. -Please give us a chance. There will be no next time. Next time? You're letting them stay? -It's none of your business. -Shut up. They're still young and playful. They will get better as time passes. I'll find something for all of you to do tomorrow. We should thank our master. -Thank you, master. -Thank you, master. Dying branch, don't worry. I'm an old tree that has lived for a thousand years. I'm not afraid of wind and storm. Crawl up to me. Be quick! Where is the crow? It's your cue! Why are you making that noise? You're a crow. Now you look like a black chicken. Crows can fly. You should jump higher. Like this. Then you'll look like a crow. So this is how you teach them? Art can tone down one's temper. Art in the form of torn tires and exhausted pipes? I have lots of them in my garage. It's so boring. I'll pass. I have to work overtime today. I have to go. -Let me send you. -Sure. By the way, the rehearsal that you told me to come, is it artistic? Of course! But it won't be boring. Let's wait and see. You were completely into it. It's amazing. You really don't enjoy music? Not really. I just don't appreciate your music. You'll appreciate it if you listen to it more frequently. What kind of music do you like? Just hug each other And kiss each other nonstop We don't have to breathe We don't have to stay away from others Some cars passed by us in the rain Some pedestrians passed by us On the street We've skipped the traffic lights It's only you and I You know about the charity dinner, right? Who will you invite as your partner? In the name list, we have Baron Chan's daughter, Chairman Ho's sister-in-law -and-- -Enough. I've got myself a date. A new girl again? Stop bringing up the past. It's for you. I bought a new dress for tomorrow's dinner. If you think it's not suitable, I can change it. Let me show it to you. She's your date? -She will be your date. -Me? I got it. No wonder you always smell like petroleum lately. Does that mean you have tamed the garage girl? Show some respect. You're being serious. You told me before that she's too tough to handle. She's so fierce. Exactly, but I like it. You look gorgeous! You're on time. I'm a punctual person. It's hard to get a taxi over here. Mind riding on my bike? I don't think it's a good idea. -I have my own transport. -Really? Please park my bicycle. Why are you late? Excuse me. Let me introduce you to two persons. They are our sponsors. Mr. Jim, don't drink too much! Just a little. Just a little bit more. A little bit more. Mr. Chan is very helpful. Thank you. Mr. Chan, there's a call for you. See you. Am I pretty? You look like a turkey. -Turkey? -Do you plan to try out a turkey after tasting black chicken? -What are you talking about? -I'm talking about chicken. -Chicken? -Yes. Shu Lam, come here. Let me introduce you to someone. Here. You smell like petroleum. Now I remember. You're the girl from the garage. You repaired my car once. -Did I? -Yes. Hey! You're usually fully covered. I didn't realize that your figure is so good. Please show some respect. Don't keep it to yourself. You're very fit. Are you okay? Do you need a little bit more? Why did you beat him? Do you believe that I will beat you up? Mr. Jim, you're drunk. I only drank a little bit. Yes, bit by bit. -Mr. Ku. -Don't be a busybody. Yes. It's quite lovely. It suits me and Philadonna well. You'll be mine soon. Do you think that I'm rude? No. I like your attitude. My boyfriends ran away because I beat them up. You're no match for me. I'm good at fighting. What's so great about it? You must be scared of being tickled. No, I'm not afraid of it. Really? -Really. -Stand still and don't move. -Why? -Open up your hands. -What are you doing? -I'm going to tickle you. -Stop it! -You're scared of tickle! -How about you? -No, I'm not afraid of it. -Are you sure? -Yes. -I'll tickle you. -Sure. -Don't move. -Okay. Here I come. Lift your arms. You're really not scared of tickles. Come closer. Ears are more sensitive. How about your nose? -What's wrong? -My lips can't take it. Your mustache is too harsh for my lips. Let's try it again. -Stop laughing. -Hurry up. Hey! Why are you blinking your eyes whilst kissing? You're not paying attention, Master. Got it. Sorry for interrupting. Please go on. It's getting late. I have to go. Come on, kiss her! Feel free to come back for more kisses. Rascal! Why did you come home? Hey. I want to come back. You can come back anytime, but you don't have to peek at us. Since you're so generous, I'll give you a tip in return. Kiss as much as you want whilst you can. My master is leaving soon. Fly away! My baby, come here. Come here. Yes? As promised, I've removed all the CCTVs and you're no longer being supervised. -Why? -You'll know later. Look who is here. Cousin! What brings you here? I'm here to take you to England. I asked her to bring you to England to further your studies. -Why? -I can't take care of you. Do you know that she's a police officer in England? If she can take care of the criminals, no doubt she can also take care of you. Don't worry, I'll take care of her. If I'm not free, our cousin can help. He's a warden. Mom, I don't want to go. LEVEL THREE Rascal! You still came back? You're inhumane. You attempted to rape your sister-in-law. Listen carefully. I'm moving back to my sister's place. Don't say I'm not generous. I'll leave the place to you. Are you asking for another fight? -Who are you looking for? -Are you Kam Zi Git? I am. I'm in big trouble. Hey. Don't beat me, please. I'll die if you beat me. I have a serious cough. Fine. Hey! I'm all right. I've fully recovered. You can beat me up now. -Beat him up! -Beat him up! -Beat him up! -Help! -Please. -Beat him up! Beat him up! Die! Though I'm severely injured, I managed to keep my dignity. Kneel. Within seven days, pay him 99,999 dollars as medical fee. Then you're still our brother. If you fail to pay, prepare to be our "sister"! Got it. That's not right. You need to act like you're in great pain. Why can't you do that? -What happened? -Are you okay? -What happened? -Well done! Look at him! He looks like he's in great pain. Both his body and spirit show that he's in great pain. My fellow students. As a good actor, when you're acting as an injured person, you must be completely into the role. You must continue acting until you're asked to stop. The makeup looks so real. -Where did you learn to use makeup? -Hey! Enough. You can stop acting now. Get up. -Fellow students, let's start practicing. -Hey! Look how real his acting is! I'm really in pain. Can someone help me up? You're not talented. Let Zi Git do this. Zi Git. Where are you? I'm here. I'm injured for real. -Let's help him up. -Come. Are you okay? No wonder your acting looks so real. Zi Git, did you fight with someone? -Was it a great fight? -Why did you go alone? -Why didn't you bring us along? -Be serious! Relax. At this stage, I can't hide it anymore. I just did something that I think all of you should take note. On my way here, there was this kid, about a year old. He suddenly ran across the road. The situation was critical. Without hesitance, I went up and... You didn't hold me. Why didn't you hold me? I can't tell if you're just acting. What happened next? I was carrying that kid. There was a... There was a truck coming. It was a truck that carries a lot of goods. It was approaching our direction. Then I... I was hit by the truck and I rolled. -That's amazing. -That's amazing! And I rolled this way. The kid was safe. That was how I got injured. Bring me the medicated oil and get him up. -Be gentle. -Be careful! Hey! Are you all right? -Here, the medicated oil. -Bring it. -Put it on him! -Quick. -Hey! Stop rubbing. -Rub it on his left hand. Give us a hand. -Let me do it. -How can you do that? -What do you know? -Stop rubbing. -You wouldn't know how to do this. -I'm seriously injured! Stop screaming. -Of course you would feel pain. -It's bruising there. You won't get better if we don't do this. Don't interrupt me. You rub the lower part. My lower part is fine! Goodness! Save me! Be honest. What happened to you? Like what I told you, I sacrificed myself to save a kid. Really? Each of you, get the medicated oil and rub on his wound. -Sure! -Please don't. Will all of you help me if I speak the truth? We would help you no matter what. -Of course we would help! -Yes. All right. I'll be honest. Actually, I was threatened by gangsters, but I refused to give in. That's why I was beaten up by them. They had also forced me to pay them 99,999 dollars within a week. Otherwise, they will beat me up again. I believe that in order to protect justice, each of you will donate money to me. I... I know every one of you has left. After filling up this hole, please help me replace the iron door with a wooden door. Zi Git, you're back. What's wrong? What happened to you? I was hit by a truck when I was trying to save a kid. You must be lying. -Be honest! -No! The phone is ringing. Stand still. Don't move. Hello? Yes. Hey. What happened to you? I should be asking that question. -Why did you bring so many luggage? -Okay, I'll be back right away. My mom forced me to go to England with my cousin. That's why I decided to come here. I'm not leaving. I'll stay here. What's wrong with both of you? I'm going back to work. I'll deal with you when I come back. Zong Yok. Can I have some money? There's no way I'm giving you money. It's urgent. What's so urgent? You only bring troubles to me. I only have 200 dollars. Share it with her. I'll be going. You better behave yourself! Zong Yok! Hey! Do you know that I'm in big trouble now? I can't even protect myself. So? Are you dumping me? Well, I... Fine, I'll leave then. Hey, visit us when you're free. Aren't you supposed to persuade me to stay? Don't stay for too long. You're not making me stay at all? Why should I put in effort when I know you're not leaving? -You're such a bad guy. -Hey. You still beat me when I'm badly injured. You don't love me anymore. You don't love me anymore, do you? I know that you still love me. No! -Ma'am. -You rascal! Where are you keeping my baby? You don't have to scold me. I won't just scold you, I'd beat you up too. -Tell me where she is! -Hey! That's enough! You're just like your daughter. Both of you like to beat people up. So what? Tell me where she is! I was about to tell you where she is. -But I don't feel like telling you now. -What? Please forgive me. I've misunderstood you. I'm sorry. Please tell me where is she. -Your daughter, -Yes? -she was planning to run away with me. -What? But I didn't agree to it. If you treat her like a prisoner, she'll run away with other guys, and it'll be too late. All right. I promise not to lock her up from now on. Please tell me where she is. She can only be at my place. There she is. My baby. Quen, please take the luggage. My baby, please tell me if you're not happy. You don't have to run away. I won't treat you like a prisoner from now on. Mom, I don't want to go to England. No problem. Let's go home. Get in the car. Come on. You still can't let go of him? Mom, he is not a bad guy. He persuaded me to go home. Mom, Zi Git is in trouble. He needs a hundred thousand dollars. Hey Zi Git, don't leave. Where are you going? I said I won't borrow from your mom. Why do you need so much money? -He's being blackmailed. -Stop talking about it. It's my own fault for hanging out with the wrong people. Zi Git, don't leave. -I'll follow you. -I can lend you the money. He won't be able to pay back because he just got fired from his job. Now, are you lending or taking from me? It's just the same. Mr. Ku's flight ticket has been confirmed. -Thank you. -You're welcome. It's your flight ticket. Are you not willing to leave? Stay then. Hong Kong is a good place. Let's go. -Master. -Hey. Why are you here? This bakery belongs to my mom. Aren't you working in a garage? Did you change your job? No. Her mom gave me a new name, Mou. And she asked me to work here. Hey. -Try these, I made them. -Sure. It smells like petroleum. It's true. Master, you're the best! I'll send you home. It's all right. I can go home by bus. Baby, get in the car. Mom, I want to go back by bus too. All right. Come home early. -Bye, Mom. -Bye. Zi Git, wait for me. Let's go back by bus together. Why did you choose the bus over Rolls Royce? -Which is more expensive? -Well-- -Of course the bus is more expensive! -Funny. Then we can meet up with my friends to work on our kung fu. Mom wants to me to come home early. -It'll be quick. I'll take you home later. -Okay. -Wait for me. -Hurry up! We're running out of time. Let's go home. Excuse us. -He'll answer your questions later. -Mr. Ku... -Excuse us. -Mr. Ku, I heard that... -Be careful. -Mr. Ku... -Be careful. -Please excuse us. Excuse us. Your questions will be answered later. -Please come this way. Excuse us. -Mr. Ku... -Excuse us. -There'll be a press conference later. -This way, please. -Excuse us. Hey kid, look over here and smile. Smile. Thank you so much. Hey, everyone. There will be a press conference later on the third floor at the hotel. Please let Mr. Ku change his attire. Many guests are waiting for him. We'll answer the questions later. Excuse us. Thank you. Excuse us. Thank you. -Please leave the place. -All right. -Please leave now. -I'll be leaving. Please leave now. Excuse me, can I see Mr. Ku? I'm afraid Mr. Ku is not free to see anyone now. Okay. By the way, Zong Yok is here. -Mr. Ku. -Did you see a girl with long hair? Yes, but she left. -Hey. -What are you doing? Zong Yok. The concert was a huge success. Thank you so much. -How are you doing? -Thank you. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Why isn't Mr. Ku around? Yes. He's currently busy. He'll join us later. -Don't be shy. Make yourself at home. -Sure. -Cheers. -Cheers. What are you waiting for? He's going back tomorrow. We're here. -Let me press the doorbell. -But you're blind. -Chopsticks. -Chopsticks. Open the door. -We are here. -Hurry up. We've brought a bottle of champagne. Chopsticks, open the door. -Open the door. -We're here to celebrate for you. -Fellow friends. -What is it? We shouldn't disturb him at the moment. He has important things do to. -What's so important? -Really? -It's about love. -Goodness. -Open the door. -Please do me a favor. -We're here to do him a favor. -Exactly. We can't help him with this. Please do not disturb. Let's go. -We only see him once in a decade. -That's right. You'll see him again soon. -I'm blind. Let me help him out. -Don't disturb. -You're just pretending to be blind. -No way. In March next year, I'm going to have a concert in Hong Kong. That's great. I'll train myself not to doze off using this one year. Mr. Ku, your luggage is already in the car. It's time to depart for the airport. Okay, thank you. You may leave first. Let me send you home. No need. You will still leave after that. Just let me stay here. No point talking so much. You still have to leave anyway. Take back your sword. You can cut the ties with that. Don't tell me you've become a clingy person. -Who are you looking for? -Are you Ms. Kam? -Yes. -You've got a parcel from Mr. Ku. Please sign here. Hey, Zong Yok. -What? -I have a good deal for you. What is it? Just follow me. What is it? I won't fool you this time. Come on. It's a really good deal. Go! What are you waiting for? Give her the ring. Hey! Someone wants to marry you even though you are so fierce. Don't talk nonsense. I haven't accepted him. You don't want the ring? Give it to me! No way. I knew it! Bravo! -Congratulations! -Congratulations! Subtitle translation by Jia Yuan
