(traffic rumbles) (man coughs and sniffs) - You just littered the street. - Hey man, it was empty. - Well, I want you to go back and pick it up. - What? - I said, I want you to go back and pick it up. - Like hell I will. - It's people like you who make our world filthy, my friend. You're a pig. Did you hear what I said? - Yeah. - Tell me. - It's people like me who make our world filthy. I'm a pig. - Now, go back and pick up your trash. Put it in your pocket. Now, don't you feel better? (clocks ticking) (door slams) (clock ticks) (coffee trickles) (whimsical mysterious music) (clock ticks) (metal scrapes) (whimsical mysterious music) - [Girl] George's house. He lives over about, oh, about a mile from school. - [Girl] Wow. Better not, I haven't heard from Ron, so I don't know what's happening. Yeah. - [Girl] Judy thinks she's pregnant. - [Girl] Oh wow. - [Girl] I feel really suck for her. She thinks it's by Mike, you know, she hasn't said anything to anybody, you know, yet. - [Girl] What's she gonna do about it? - [Girl] I don't know, she's not even sure yet, you know, but she probably is, it's been about two months, you know? - [Girl] Two months, I told her to go on the pill. - [Girl] Yeah. She's gonna tell him this weekend, I think, you know? See what he does, you know? - [Girl] I wouldn't, I don't know. - [Girl] She hasn't told her mom or anybody. - [Girl] Think her mom would know? - [Girl] Yeah, for sure. (uneasy music) - [Girl] What are we gonna do after school today? - [Boy] I don't know, I think I might go to Jeff's house. - [Girl] Come on, let's go in. - [Boy] They have a pool. Jeff's parents put a new pool in outside. - [Girl] That sounds like fun. (students conversing) (tense music) (explosion booms) (flames hiss) (explosion booms) (explosion booms) (mysterious music) (sinister harpsichord music) (mysterious music) (whimsical playful music) (dramatic music) (eerie music) (explosion booms) - We got a break, there's a witness. The bomber raped the patient after he set the bomb. - Why did the victim take so long to report it? - She's a mute. - How can I talk to her? - Well, it's only her speech that's impaired, she can hear. - Can you tell me what happened last night, miss? Please, can you give me a description of the man who attacked you? Can you tell me what he looked like? - No. I'm too ashamed. - We've got to find him before he hurts somebody else. Can you tell me what he did before he attacked you? Did he hit you? - [Woman] He grabbed me from behind, put tape on my mouth, and ripped my sleeping gown. I want to die. - Well, if I find him, he's gonna beg to die. - [Hospital PA] Miss Barron, dial 1-4-7. Miss Barron, dial 4-1-7. Miss Barron, dial 4-1-7. - This is the room. That's the door the bomber came in. - It's locked. - A patient had died that night. It was left unlocked for delivery of a coffin. - Well, somehow it wasn't locked again. - Probably. - He could have waited outside, saw the coffin being delivered, and then he sneaked in, came through this door into this room. Through this door, the only way to the basement, to plant his bomb. Then he must have come back here to wait for somebody to attack. Oh, but it doesn't make any sense, does it? Knowing there's a bomb ready to go off that he'd stick around here. - Well, then who attacked Martha? - There were two men who broke into the mental hospital, a bomber and a rapist. The rapist came first, and he hid in the supply room. When the bomber came to plant his bomb in the basement, he had to go through the supply room and return the same way to get out. Now this means the rapist's got two good looks at the bomber. Now to find our bomber without any identification in Los Angeles County, over 4,000 square miles with over seven million people is, is pretty hopeless. But there was an eyewitness, the rapist. The rapist can tell us what the bomber looks like. (car horn blares) - I've got the green light. - I can turn right on red, man. - No, no, not when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk. - Wouldn't hurt you to walk a little faster, would it, buddy? - People like you are what's wrong with the world today. - What the hell are you talkin' about, man? - You have no respect for the rights of others. - Turn it off, huh? - But because you have a nice car and I have to walk, that means you own the sidewalk? - Look, I'm kind of in a hurry so why don't you get your hand off my car? - That's another thing about people like you. You sit behind the wheel of a fancy car and that makes you privileged. - Now look man, I told you to get your hand off my car. (mysterious music) - What the hell you doin'? (keys jangle) (nerve-jangling music) Hey man, give me those keys! - [Newsreader] The bombing of the Northridge Mental Hospital took an interesting turn today when this station received a tape recording from the man who claims to be the bomber. Here is his voice. - [Bomber] The police are failing in their duty to protect the rights of the common citizen. There shall be more bombs until justice is served. God is with me. - I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. Pull over here! (car horn blares) - You're not bustin' me on any phony rap today, Mr. Policeman. I'm running a kiddie show. Hey, hey! Hey! What the hell you think you're doing? - I'm giving you a citation. - What for? - Your easel protrudes three feet on a public sidewalk. Miss, I'd like the cards on every female assault case in the last four weeks with the following MO. Victim grabbed from behind with a mouth tape with the clothes ripped off the body. (computer buzzing) (lively drumming) - [Girl] Yeah, that's the way it is, and I know it. Guys get ideas, you know, about girls who work in a place where there's nudity. It's probably what gave the guy the idea he'd get away with raping me the way he did. - [Geronimo] I don't think he cared what your profession is. - I want you to check out every discharged serviceman in the LA area with a demolition specialty, and look for haters, guys with a personal gripe, construction workers who work with dynamite. If somebody buys more than five dollars worth of firecrackers on the Fourth of July, I want to know why! All right, Devincy, what's going on inside his head? Why is he bombing? - There's not enough to go on yet. Are we certain that both bombs were set by the same man? - The lab says yes. The fragments from both bombs were identical. - Each bombing will give us new insights into the man's psychological problems. I may be able to figure out a pattern after the next bombing. - I want to get him now, now before he bombs again! - I'm a psychologist. I don't read tea leaves! - You know, every man in the department's busting his butt trying to find this bomber and you, you're out interviewing some broad. - I'm looking for a rapist. - Since when did you get transferred to the vice squad, Geronimo? - Count the number of bombers we've had in LA in the last five years. Now, how many have we caught? - Now what's that supposed to mean? - It means without knowing the reason for their bombs there's no way of knowing where to look for them. There's no MO, no pattern. How do you catch a guy who wakes up one morning, decides he's gonna change the world with dynamite? - How do you catch a rapist? - He's got an MO, a pattern. - Yeah, he tapes the victim's mouth shut, he rips off her clothes and he attacks her. I read your report. - Chief, we can find him. Now let me blanket the city with police women just asking to be raped. I'll bring him in! - And I cannot send my men in two directions at the same time. Now we're going to all concentrate on the bomber! Now look, I know I'm giving you people heat but that's what I'm getting and plenty of it! I don't give a damn about your pet theories or your intuition, or what your girlfriends or your wives think. Now please help me find the bomber! Not rapists, not hookers, not pushers, just the bomber, all right? (intercom buzzes) Yeah? - [Secretary] Burglary in progress at Culver Industrial. Dynamite involved. Only information on suspect, he is armed. - So we won't find our bomber, huh? (sirens wailing) (shot cracks) (shots crack) - Listen, man! Hey, listen! I've got dynamite and blasting caps tucked all over me! You come out of there, man. Do you know what'll happen if your bullet hits one of these blasting caps? Huh? Hey (laughs) hey, this whole block will go up! (laughs) Come on out of there, man, come on! Hey! (shot cracks) Hey, I don't dig livin' that much! (shots crack) (empty barrel clicks) (shot cracks) - [Control] Control to Officer 9A8. Bomb reported in girls' dormitory across from university. 5843 Daley, fire department is en route.

Every week ends on Saturday. - Sondra, charge the man 48 cents. (register chatters) (ticking) (footsteps patting) (doorbell rings) - [Woman] Laura. They're gonna be late.

It's forgotten these days. I'll have a cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee. - Yes sir. (whimsical harpsichord music) (people murmuring) (elevator door clatters) (whimsical mysterious music) - The day of the male chauvinist is gone. Women are no longer second class citizens to be looked upon as love objects of men, utilized as receptacles for the germ of their masculine insecurities. Women have been used and abused long enough. We are free at last, free of male domination, free to work under equal conditions, free to make love as equal partners. Think about it. Women outnumber men so we can outvote them. The wealth of the world is in the hands of women! So we can control industry. How many men do we know who can get pregnant and give birth? Not very many. We're not the weaker sex. We're the stronger. We outlive men, we outlove men, we outthink men. Until now, women have made the major decisions that have shaped the world by influencing their men. Enough of that! We don't have to pamper the male ego any longer. Now is the time to stand up and be counted! (clapping) Thank you! (explosion booms) (women screaming) (sinister mysterious music) - [William] Again I have been forced to bomb in order to punish the people who have wronged me. They must pay for their crimes and must learn it is I who am the superior one.

(dark sinister tones) (computer buzzing and whirring) (bass-heavy funky soul music) - Hey baby, want a ride? Come on. Come on, hey, I'm not gonna hurt you. Hey come on, you'll enjoy it, come on! - [Girl] Let go! - Hey, what's going on? Hey come on, you pig, get your hands off! I didn't do nothin'! - No! (raunchy saxophone music) - [Girl] Help! Stop! Let me go! - [Attacker] Get your hands off me! Argh! (men conversing) - Any luck? - No. - You can't touch me! I plead the Fifth Amendment. - What did you say? - I plead the Fifth Amendment! - Now just what's the Fifth Amendment? - I don't know, but it protects me from guys like you. (choking) - None of them used the MO of the rapist we're looking for. - Well, maybe it's just possible he changed his technique. (gagging) (mysterious music) (bass-heavy funky soul music) (raunchy saxophone music) (groans) (cries out) (cuffs rattle) - Ooh!

The machine's outside. - [Offender] No. - [Geronimo] What's your name? - Fromley. - Would you speak louder please? - Do you have to record everything I say? - Yeah. - My lawyer said I don't have to answer your questions. - I don't care what your lawyer said. - He's arranging my bail. - Well, do you think we can continue until you hear from him? - I don't have to tell you anything except my name. - Turn around. - So you can hit me in the back of the head? - Mr. Fromley, if I've got to look at your face for 10 continuous seconds, I'll blow your brains out. Now turn around. You were arrested last night for attempted rape. You got anything to say about that? - My name is George Fromley. - Have you ever been arrested before? - My name is George Fromley. - The record's got you down for at least eight assaults. - George Fromley. - Mr. Fromley, now what do you think of a man that bombs a state mental hospital and a high school? - He's sick, he oughta be locked up. - Then will you help us identify the bomber? - Me, how can I? - You saw him. - Can I check and see what happened to my lawyer? - You can check your memory and tell me what the man who bombed the Northridge asylum looked like. - My name is George Fromley. - You were there-- - George Fromley! - All right, George Fromley. The girl you raped at the hospital will identify you. Let's go! (mysterious music) - Lieutenant, call's for you. - Now you stay put! Hello! - I want you to see our three children. A man who loves his children as much as George does couldn't do the thing you people say he has done. - Your husband could help us catch the bomber, Mrs. Fromley. - Well, those bombings are terrible. - What's that? - That's George's room. (mysterious music) When George called last night, he said you people made a big mistake. - You have a key? - Oh no, George doesn't let anyone go in there. - Well, I can fix that. Mrs Fromley, do you mind if I ask you an extremely personal question? - What do you want to ask me? - Well, is he normal? I mean, sexually? - Of course he's normal. What do you mean? You have no right to invade a person's privacy like this. (sinister music) George took them of me, by himself. Photography is his hobby. George could never attack women like you say he did. He's a fine husband. Besides, he was home with me the night of the bombing. He was here all the time. - How about last night, when he was arrested for attempted rape? Was he home then? - Lieutenant? - Release Fromley. - He's not the guy? - He's guilty as hell. - This is Investigator Blake. Release George Fromley. Uh, no charge. I'll make out the necessary papers and send them down to you in the tube. All right. (paper crinkles) Hey, what's wrong? - My wife, she's getting married again. - Do you care? - Who cares? We're strangers. - What about your boy? - I hope that bomber doesn't blow himself up before I get to him. - [William Voiceover] Open letter to the Bomber. We ask you to give yourself up so that your complaints may be attended to. This newspaper will guarantee that you will be treated fairly. (tense music) (typewriter platen ratcheting) (keys tapping) - Mr. Editor, society has had its chance to treat me fairly. It is too late. Now is the time for punishment and retribution. I am watching the police as they foolishly try to catch me. They should be spending their time punishing the evil ones rather than oppressing and persecuting me. Warning: the police too will suffer my justice. (tense music) Why are you bothering me? - What's that, buddy? - I said why are you harassing me? If you policemen would spend your time searching out criminals instead of burning up gasoline, you'd provide the community with a real service. - Are you looking for trouble, mister? - Don't intimidate me. I know more about the law than you'll ever know. - Shall we uh, split? (birds tweeting) (knocker rapping) - What do you want? - We have a warrant for your arrest. - What for? - Failure to appear in a municipal court with regard to a traffic citation. - Are you kiddin', a traffic ticket? What's that guy trying to do? - You'll have to come with us. - At 6:00 in the morning? For a lousy traffic ticket? Like hell I will! (shots crack) You've got no right dragging me down here at this hour. - Sit down. - I want to talk to my lawyer. I know my civil rights. - What do you think you are, black? No, in this room, Mister, you've got no civil rights. Not till 10 o'clock in the morning when court convenes. You're nothing but a rapist, Fromley. A no-good degenerate. I don't care who you raped, that's for the vice squad, but I want to know who the bomber is. You're gonna tell me what he looks like. I'm gonna blow your brains out, Fromley, unless you tell me what I want to know. - You wouldn't shoot. - Wouldn't I? No, the most they'd give me is a 90-day suspension then I'd be right back here as if nothing happened. But you (chuckles), you'd be buried in a hole with your brains blown out. - You're bluffin'. (safety clicks) - Am I? - I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Sergeant Quinn is going to help you remember what the bomber looked like. - [Quinn] Okay, Mr. Fromley. I want you to take your time and look at these facial contours, and tell me if you see any of them there that remind you of the man you saw that night. - That one right there, something like that one. - Is his hair right? - Yeah. - How about the chin? - Uh-huh. - Sit down, Fromley. - Well I don't know whether I can remember too much-- - You'll remember. Now what about his eyes? Were they deep-set? What did they look like? Where they round? Where they elongated? - Well, how do you expect me to remember something like that? I only saw him for a second. It was dark. Well, kind of wide eyes, bushy eyebrows, I think. - You see them on the sheet here? - I can't see nothing here. - Look at the sheet, Fromley! - Well, something like those, right there. - Are you sure? - Yeah. E-41, now what about his mouth? Was it a full mouth, straight mouth? - Kind of thin mouth, thin. - Look at every one of those, see if you can spot it. - Well, uh, this one, right here. M-7-8. Let's see some noses. Did he have a long nose? Was it bulbous, upturned, hooked? - Kind of long, long nose, yeah. - Well uh, yeah, here, that one. N-2-2. Let's put them all together. You're doing real fine, Fromley. You just keep on remembering. You keep on remembering like this and pretty soon we can let you go home. You'll be able to go back into your room and look at those porno films of your wife. - No, that ain't him. I can't remember what he looked like. It was dark! - Now you listen to me, Fromley. You're gonna look at this thing until you do remember, or you gonna go blind in the process. Do you understand? Now put these on projection, Sergeant. Come on, get up. Sit down. All right, Sergeant. - No, it's a longer face, more hair too. Yeah, that's better. That looks more like it. No, they were narrower, narrower on the eyes. Those are too wide. Yeah, yeah all right. (projector clicking) Yeah. Yeah, that's him, that's him right there. - You sure that's him, George? - Yeah, yeah, that's the man all right. - You positive? - I just told you that's him. - Well, tell me again, George. - You know, maybe I better look at some more pictures. Maybe I didn't seem from the front. - Let's see the profiles, Sergeant. (projector clicking) - Yeah! Little longer on the nose. Little well... It's a little further out, the nose is too close into the face. - Yeah, that's better. (projector clicking) Eyes are fine, hair's all right. (projector clicking) That's him! That's him! (projector clicking) Yeah, that's him. That is him! - George. Are you sure, George? - Yeah, that's the guy all right, that's him! - Well George, you better be damn sure. Because we'll find him, we'll pick him up. If you're wrong, George, I'm gonna come and getcha. (mysterious music) Miss Roman? Miss Roman, do you recognize this man? - Looks like Mr. Dorn. It was his daughter who died the night before the bombing. - Was she a patient in the hospital? - Yes, she was admitted about nine months ago. - What was wrong with her? - Drugs, heroin addict. - You know her father's first name? - William. - Do you think you have his address? - Yes, I'm sure I do. (upbeat music) (engine rumbling) (tires screech) (dramatic music) (door handle rattles) (kick thuds) (door slams) - It is imperative that the public listens to these messages so they will know why they're being punished. (dramatic music) - I haven't seen him since our daughter's funeral. - Do you know where I can find him? - No. - Usually, when people like him are on the run they hide in a place that they know. - He wouldn't come here. - Did you have a rough marriage? - The only time he wasn't uptight was when he was with his daughter. - Were they close? - That's what blew his mind. When he found out she was taking drugs. Sometimes I think if we'd never had a daughter, things would have been different. - Same thing, people never change. - [Reporter] Mr. Fromley, is it true that the District Attorney has dropped the criminal charges pending against you because you cooperated in identifying the Mad Bomber? - [George] Ask my counselor. - [Counselor] You'll have to ask the District Attorney about that. - [Reporter] But you are a free man today? - [George] Free as a bird. - Did you know that William Dorn was the bomber when you first saw him? - No comment. - What were you doing at the Northridge State Hospital the night of the bombing, Mr. Fromley? - No comment! - [Reporter] Well, Mr. Fromley, do you deny that you were arrested for attempted rape? - [Counselor] Gentlemen please, my client has absolutely nothing to say at this time! - [Reporter] Is this the picture of the Mad Bomber, Mr. Fromley? - [Counsel] You'll have to get a statement from the DA's office about that. - [Reporter] What do you think of the man who's been setting off all those bombs? - The Mad Bomber's sick, he should be locked up.

Why don't you look through these? Maybe you can find something about Dorn. (newspapers rustle) - Here it is. High school student Anne Dorn was arrested yesterday at Lincoln High School for possession of drugs. His first bombing, the high school. - This one is a month after that. August 14. - Man attacks hotel manager. William Dorn was arraigned today in Municipal Court on the criminal assault charge resulting from an episode occurring in the lobby of the Sheraton Plaza. Bombing number three. - This last one's 18 months old. Dorn didn't have to keep a diary. The newspapers did it for him. Well, he's in here somewhere. Find it, and we'll have his next bombing before he does it. (paper rustles) Bus crash kills three. A bus carrying the employees baseball team of the Harvester Tool and Die Company crashed last night en route to a game. Two members of the team died, five others are still hospitalized in critical condition. - William Dorn was definitely a member of our employees baseball team 18 months ago. He was on the bus on the day of the accident and he never let us forget it. - What did he do? - Well, he claimed his back was permanently injured and was unable to work. He demanded an enormous financial settlement. - How much did he get? - Well, we offered him a small settlement, but he refused it. Not one doctor substantiated his claim The man was unquestionably lying or was a hypochondriac. In either event, our insurance didn't cover it. - Was it ever resolved? - Well, he threatened us for a while. His letters are in his file and they're really hateful letters. - Was that the end of it? - Yeah, he finally stopped writing. - How long ago was that? - Well, it's been almost a year now since Dorn's last letter and that one was the meanest of the lot. Would you like to read it? - Yeah. ♪ You were the only man ♪ Passing through my life ♪ Tell me why the sun shines ♪ And gives me light ♪ But I didn't listen ♪ Thinking I knew more (machinery whirs and squeals) - Paterson?

(machinery whirs and squeals) (motorcycle engine throbs) Here he comes! - Dorn is on a motorcycle approaching from the east. (dramatic music) - Come on! Come on! - He's gone around the building. - Hold your fire till he comes past us. (engine revving) (dramatic music) (rifle shots crack) (barrels rumble) (explosion booms) (flames crackling) - [William Voice Recording] Today you police have prevented me from setting off what was to have been my last bomb. Now, because of what you have done, it is necessary for me to punish all of society. At this very moment, I am driving through the streets of our city in a red van with enough dynamite in the back to level a city block. Very shortly, I will push the detonator switch next to me to set off the explosion. There is nothing you can do to stop me. You are just as helpless as with my other bombings, and the only thing you can do is wait until it happens. In the event I fail to activate the switch, it will all happen just the same. I intend to drive through the most populated areas of our city until I decide where to die, taking with me the greatest number of people, then everything will be all right again. (switch clicks) - Patch me into radio. Emergency, all units. This is Chief Forester. Be on the lookout for a red panel truck. Stake and notify, do not intercept. Driver is bomber with explosives. I repeat, do not intercept. - That psycho isn't bluffing. When he says something, he means it! - [Control] Suspect's red van observed eastbound on Wilshire. Man identified as the Mad Bomber is driving. - I can pick him off with my rifle. - You are going to do nothing, understand? I don't want any shooting as long as he's in that truck. We've got to get him out. Geronimo, did you understand what I said? - What do you want me to do? Take the day off until he blows up a couple of hundred people? - [Patrol] N-L-5 through to Control. Suspect is in the downtown area, northbound on Grant from 7th Street. - [Patrol Officer] 7-A-5-5 to Control. Bomber suspect in the red van has just passed our location at 5th and Flowers. (tense music) - [Patrol Officer] 2-A-12 to Control. The suspect in the red van observed traveling southbound on the San Diego Freeway. I'm following the suspect and request further instruction. - [Control] Control One to 2-A-12, do not approach suspect unless he leaves the red van. Repeating, do not approach suspect unless he leaves red van. (tense music) - [Patrol Officer] 8-A-15 to Control. The red van is on Robertson, southbound toward Wilshire. - [Patrol Officer] 8-A-22 to Control. The red van with the bomber suspect is now crossing Olympic, southbound on Robertson. - [Patrol Officer] 8-A-19 to Control. Bomber suspect observed approaching Pico.
