-Run... -Catch me... (indistinct chatter continues) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Meesha ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Thank you. So cute, right? Then... this is me. It's a cloud. -Bye. -Bye. Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Greetings, Princess. Pardon me, I... Don't blame yourself. It's the train. It was running at its own sweet time. And you must have arrived early as always, Padam kaka. Even after all these years, you still remember my name? Even the stories you told me. The young queen awaits your arrival at the palace. MY DEAR MISHRI, I WROTE MANY LETTERS TO YOU BEFORE THIS ONE, BUT I NEVER HAD THE COURAGE TO SEND THEM. I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER FORGIVE ME... So good to see you, Meesha. Welcome. Welcome home. Hi, Rukmani. Look at you, all grown up. I was worried when your train was delayed. I wanted to receive you personally. Anyway. I hope Padam was on time. A match made in heaven. Ratan and Commander. Like a dog's tail. He sits at the gate, waiting for him, before his car arrives. Rukmani. Where is Daata? Don't chop his head off for this. The workers at our salt farms went on strike, so he had to leave immediately. But, to be fair, he tried really hard to be here. But don't worry, he will return in a few days. Until then, I will keep you company. Come. Let me show you your room. No one is allowed to touch a single thing. Ratan is very particular about this. Everything is just the way you... Okay. I'll see you for dinner. I have a confession to make. I was very curious about you. So I looked you up online. But... you are a ghost. I mean a zero digital footprint. In this day and age, it's very strange. Actually, I had nothing to share. After Mom's death and my accident, I was only filled with hatred. For Daata. For you. I blamed you for everything. Look, I am sorry. I didn't intend to split up your family. That's not what I wanted. Come. I have something to show you. All that Ratan had were these memories of you. He would keep watching these videos on a loop. Since the day you left, time had stood still for Ratan. He kept blaming himself. For Gayatri's suicide. Then your accident. He wrote dozens of letters. He tried calling you many times, but... your hatred prevented him. And then he began devoting all his time to the Meesha Foundation. He is delighted that you are returning home. Then why isn't he here? Hi. You've reached Ratan Singh Gaikwad. I am unable to take your call right now. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Daata? Daata? Daata? Daata? Meesha. Meesha. Meesha, can you hear me? Meesha. Welcome back to the world of the living. No, no, don't get up. Don't get up. You could have a slight concussion. Thank God you are all right, Meesha. But it could have been worse. You had us so worried. All alone, at this late hour... What were you thinking? I saw Daata. But isn't Ratan on a business trip? Isn't he, Rukmani? Yes. Are you sure, Meesha? He had the same coat on, of a magician. The magician's hat. Then I followed him till the wharf. So, you mean to say that Ratan is back and he is playing hide and seek with us. I know what I saw. Meesha, you must have seen Kapil. He is our estate manager. He came back this evening. We heard your scream all the way to our living quarters. The three of us rushed immediately and found you unconscious. Did you see anyone else there? -No, Your Highness-- -Why don't you understand? I know he is here. Okay. Okay. Calm down. Rukmani, there is no harm in taking a look for Meesha's reassurance. I checked everywhere, Your Highness. There is no one here. Fine. There. I saw his reflection in the water. Fine, if you say so-- No, that's enough. Let's go. We shouldn't be near the wharf at midnight. Ghosts and spirits come here to sip water. You think this is a joke. No, I don't. You may have seen your own reflection. Dr. Shekhawat, I am sorry. -We troubled you at this hour-- -Rukmani-ji. What's the point of saying sorry after troubling me? Don't forget her medicines. She needs a good night's sleep. -Padam Singh-- -No, it's okay. It's okay. I'll walk home. But... Come. Do you take sugar, Princess? Lajjo. Do you know where Daata is? Ma'am, I... I work in the kitchen. Maybe Kapil would know. After all, he looks after the estate. Meesha. How are you? You look better. You are not ready yet. What for? Skeet shooting. Your dad's favourite sport. It used to be polo. Used to be. But after the riding injury when he fell off the horse, he stopped riding entirely. Skeet shooting became his new favourite. Boys and their toys, you know. Not that I understand. Wow. You were perfect, RJ. I could have done that with my blindfold on. Always a pleasure, Your Highness. The real queen of Mayagarh has returned. The news did reach me. Man, you're gorgeous. Rana Jai Singh. -Your cousin. -Distant cousin. Very distant. I don't see His Majesty today, so who will be facing off against me? One of you, I assume. Kapil. Yes? He will represent us today. So, Kapil, can you save the king's honour? I will try. But I am a bit nervous since I'll be facing you. That's how you learn, right? -Yes. -All the best, lad. By the way, I am hosting a small party on Friday. You two should come. -Really? -Yeah. What's the occasion? My victory, of course. Lost your empire, but not your arrogance. Right? Welcome, Ashok-ji. Welcome. Come, sit. You are all that was missing here. -How are you, Rukmani? -I am good. Sit. Oh, by the way, Meesha. Ratan's daughter. Saw you as a kid. And this is SP Ashok Tanvar. But not for very long, right? He's going to be promoted soon. Wow! Top cop of the city. How lucky, SP sir? Unfortunately, guys like us have to work hard, Rana-ji. Not everything is handed down to us. I was only joking, SP sir. Don't arrest me. And even if this legacy was handed down to me, so what? Might as well take advantage of the privileges. Right, my queen? Now, if you ladies excuse me, I gotta show you how it's done. Fuck! Mr. Rana. Guess you will lose to the king's vizier today. You should see a doctor. Princess! It's not as bad as it looks. I was lucky that skeet shooting uses blanks. Not real bullets. What happened to your rifle all of a sudden? Courtesy of Mr. Rana. He slid this into the barrel so the gun would backfire. I should blame myself. People like Rana cannot tolerate people like me on the same level as them. Although the king isn't like him at all. Then what is he like? He always says, "No good deed ever goes to waste. -"It always--" -"Makes a difference somewhere." Yes. Although I have a pretty old connection with your family. Come. I was 10 years old when I came to steal in the palace. I got caught. But do you know what His Majesty did? He didn't yell or call the police. He kept his hand on my head and gave me another chance. In fact, your foundation sponsored my entire education. -Here. -What? Give me your hand. Ma'am, please... Then you must know... where Daata is. Actually, I was representing the king in the court for a property dispute. I returned just recently, so... Kapil. Yes? Is everything okay between Daata and Rukmani? Well, ma'am... From here, the royal palace seems pretty close. But the distance is too great. Even though I am pretty close to His Majesty, I am clueless about his personal life. Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to your question. Shall we? It's my turn now. Of course, my darling. Come, join me. Join me. She's kept the entire house awake since last night. I am done trying to explain to her. Why doesn't anyone get it? Things are happening in this house that no one can explain. I fear something has happened to Daata. Meesha-ji, I just checked the entire palace. I found nothing. And no one saw anything. I did. Isn't that enough? That's not what I meant. But listen to yourself. First, you claim to see the king at the wharf. If you did, then how could he be missing? And, if he is missing, then who did you see? Fine. Then tell me where he is. And why is his phone switched off? It could be any number of reasons. And maybe I shouldn't be saying this in front of Rukmani-ji. But you don't know your father too well. I do. His antics are quite infamous. You may ask him. Let it go, sir. Please tell me. Why don't you be more specific? Honestly, we have had such false alarms before. "Where is the king?" "His Majesty is missing. His phone is switched off." Et cetera, et cetera. Later, we'd find he's at a resort with a new lady friend. Ashok. Please don't. Look, all I know is Daata called me here and now he's gone missing. Okay? So, register a missing person's complaint. Do it now! Sure. But, for that, you must come to the police station, Meesha-ji. No one seems to care anymore. At least you help me out here. I am not refusing you. But there are some rules. Come down to the station, and we'll register your complaint. See you. Ratan and I visit this temple every week. Meesha. You have even registered a missing person's FIR. Stop worrying now. Fine. Wait here. I'll be right back. Padam, wait here. Yes, Your Highness. His spirit is calling you! He's trying to reach you from the other world. His life is over. But his wait isn't over yet. -What are you doing? Let go. -Remember. -What are you doing? -Try to hear his voice. Let her go! Get away. Mishri. He is calling out to his Mishri. His Mishri. Mishri! "Calling from the other world." "Calling from the other world." "Calling from the other world." "Calling from the other world." Princess Meesha. "Calling his Mishri." "Calling his Mishri." "Calling from the other world." "Calling from the other world." Ma'am, the queen just stepped out. She sent these offerings for you. Are... you okay? -Kapil. -Yes? I met a woman at the temple today. A Rabari woman. Dressed in black. A blind woman. She was saying something about Daata. I want to meet her, Kapil. Bring her here. Here? If the queen finds out, she will be furious. His spirit is right here. Wandering. Still here. A daughter searching for her father. Show yourself. Talk to her. Call him. Call him. He is right here. Call out to him. Are you... really here? Childhood memories. Mishri's childhood memories. The fourth book. Get it. I will get it. Quickly. These pages are filled with hatred. With pain. Open and see those pages. See. What happened to Daata? Why? Daata, what's wrong with you? Please talk to me. I want to help you. Daata, can you hear me? Daata, please. Talk to me-- (murmuring) Run away, child. Run away. (continues murmuring) -Daata? -Yes, my child. What the hell is going on? -Help me. -What is this woman doing here? Who brought her here? I did, Your Highness. Did you forget your place? Please... The king has given you too much freedom. Please... Don't forget you are just a servant. -Get this woman out of here-- -Stop it! She was trying to help me. She isn't going anywhere. You get out. Get out. Don't forget this is Mishri's house. You already split this family once. I won't let it happen again. Do you understand? Get out of my room. Get out of my room. Get out of my room! I can't believe you can be so stupid, Meesha. And just because I'm being nice to you, doesn't mean you can exceed your limits. Please... -Didn't you hear me? -Yes, Your Highness. -Talk to me. Please... -Come, please. I must speak with Daata. Please, please, please. Mishri, tonight at 12:00. He will reach out to you. Wait for him. Let's go. Daata. Daata, please talk to me. Daata... Daata, I want to help. Please... Please talk to-- Daata. Daata. Daata. Daata. Daata, Daata. Daata, Daata. Anybody there? Daata. Anybody there? Anybody there? There. In the car. -Check. -Yes. There is no one here, my queen. That's not possible. I saw him with my own eyes. I checked myself. He was inside. I saw him. He was right here. Princess. Prin... Come quickly. There is a call for you. Princess. His Majesty is on the line for you. Oh, look. Your Mishri is here. Meesha, your dad. Talk to him. Say hi. Mishri. How long have I waited for this. I had lost all hope. -Your voice-- -Daata? Your voice isn't clear, child. The network out here is poor. Hello. Hello. Mishri... I am so happy I sent that letter to you. I won't let you go anywhere this time. I will be back soon. Then we'll have dinner together. Love you. I love you, child. Okay? Happy? You even had me worried for a while. What happened? Why aren't you happy? Your father is okay. Anyone can have misconceptions, Meesha-ji. But the important thing is that His Majesty is safe and sound. That wasn't Daata. But you spoke to him. At first, even I thought it was Daata. But then he... The truth is I haven't heard his voice for many years. So, how could I tell? It could be anyone. But why would anyone do such a thing? I don't know. All I know is I want to get out of this maze. The first thing they teach us in therapy is to get to the root of your fear. The answers lie in everything that tried to scare me since I got here. Meesha-ji, what are we looking for? I am sorry, but I don't understand. Kapil! Yes? That belongs to His Majesty. But, Meesha-ji, he often drove this car. How could we know when this cufflink got here? He had this on his arm yesterday. Daata has been murdered, Kapil. Meesha-ji. It all makes sense. Scaring me. Confusing me. This is just what Rukmani wants. That I start doubting myself and everyone thinks I am mentally unstable. This is what she wants. Why would the queen do such a thing? Maybe for the estate. Kapil, Daata's body was here yesterday. It must be somewhere around. But, if that was the case, Commander would have sniffed him out. You know that. Someone is assisting Rukmani. She cannot do this alone. There is one thing we can do. There is a party at Rana's house tonight. Everyone is going to be there. You should go too. We should go. Kapil. What business did Rana and Daata do together? Since Rana had to sell his palace, he's had his eyes on Daata's property. As does Rukmani. I wouldn't know that. But I do know that the queen doesn't like Rana at all. She could be faking it. The other day at skeet shooting, I definitely noticed something between Ashok and Rukmani. People say... there was a time when SP Ashok was head over heels in love with the queen. In fact, some even believe he still does, which is why he never got married. And that's Dr. Shekhawat. A relative of yours, but he's more inclined towards the queen. Maybe for the wealth. In fact, since the time you got here, people have been raising questions about you. Don't you think so? What are you doing here? Well, I... It was a mistake. I'll take your leave. You are not going anywhere. He is with me. Rukmani, Rukmani, Rukmani. You know, you really disappoint me. I think you need to be a bit more open-minded. So old-fashioned, you know. You should be like me. I always say, "Tradition, culture, royalty have their importance. "But everyone is welcome in my home." Even your staff. -What's your name? -Kapil. Kapil. Surely you remember the guy you lost to. Right? Cheers. I need to introduce you to somebody really important. -Actually, I am leaving. -No, no. No, you are not. You are coming with me. Will you excuse us, please? Thanks. Come, let's go. Come on. I am in deep fucking shit! -You even understand-- -Keep your voice down. What do you mean "keep your voice down"? You said you will handle this. This has gone way too far. This was your idea, okay? Don't blame it on me. You have until tomorrow. If I get exposed, I will disclose all your secrets. And I mean it. No, man. It's that fraud queen. She's made my life hell. I want to slit her throat... What the fuck? I'll call you back. Hey... are you two following me? Go on, get lost. We just came here to say we know all about your deal. And now we're going to the police. -Police? -Yes. That is a fantastic idea, my friend. I'll come along as well. Come on, let's go. What? You two know shit about the deal. You know... I was doing your dad a favour. It was my idea to turn that wreck into a boutique hotel. First, he said yes, and then he disappeared. And now I am screwed. Look at me. Just... look at me. Look at my million-dollar face. Just look at it. Daata didn't disappear. He is dead. That old man won't die so easily. He will take a few people along with him. I know you and Rukmani together killed him. Have you lost your mind? I borrowed Rs. 500 million for the hotel. Do you get that? If that old man is dead-- Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck, I am dead. Breathe, breathe, breathe. There is still time. Breathe, breathe, breathe. It's just an act. I know him too well. Wait a minute. You! You can sign those papers. What? Do you think we are stupid? You need Rukmani's signatures, not Meesha's. I don't want that fraud queen's signatures. If His Majesty is actually... then you are the majority holder of the estate. Right? Won't you help your cousin? Huh? For old-time's sake. Please. I am not so distantly related. How many more stories do you have up your sleeve? No stories, cousin. God promise, I swear. His Majesty has had many single malts at my place. I know everything about his will. And that's what you were discussing with the queen at the party. No. Rumour has it... your queen is pregnant. And the child doesn't belong to His Majesty. Do you think we will believe any bullshit you tell us? God. If the child belonged to the king, Rukmani would be announcing it to the world. His Majesty is too proud of his royal blood. Who is it? Who's there? No! No! No! No! No! No! It's nothing. It's nothing. Nothing. Where is it? His Majesty... always suspected the queen and Ashok. Makes sense. Who would suspect an SP? Kapil? This suit... was gifted to me by His Majesty. There is an exclusive tailor in Jaipur, who stitches his suits. One day I was standing there watching him. His style, his personality. He suddenly beckoned me and said to the tailor, "Listen, "stitch a suit for Kapil just like mine." I am sorry. I forgot... I am not the only one who grieves him. Meesha. Yeah, sweetie. What? Oh, baby. Baby, will you calm down? I am at the factory. I will be home soon. What? The king and queen's royal bed. I am trying to guess who else has slept on this bed. You have so many admirers. Ready to do your bidding. So, I am wondering... whose child it is. What did you say? I said whose child it is that you are trying to hide. Not my Daata's, I know. Stay away from matters that don't concern you. There is still time. Go away! That time is gone. -Meesha-- -Your Highness. Ashok-ji is on the line. He says it's urgent. Hello. Yes, I will be there. -Get the car. -Yes. Go. Go. Please. Meesha. Rana is dead. He is fucking dead. Take it, Commander. Why don't you eat, Commander? Take it, Commander. Eat it. Why don't you eat, Commander? I guess you are missing the king. It's all right. He will be back soon, son. Now eat. Ratan and Commander. Like a dog's tail. He sits at the gate, waiting for him, before his car arrives. Let's assume you are right. But, if that was the case, Commander would have sniffed him out. You know that. Greetings, Princess. He isn't eating. Commander. Padam kaka, untie him. Please untie him. Commander. Padam kaka. -Yes, Princess? -There is something in the wharf. In there? But... this wharf has been closed for many years. Please check. -But no one ever-- -Padam kaka, please. Fine. Hello. Kapil, where are you? I am driving. Why? I think I have found Daata's body. Make some excuse and come back. Where? The wharf. Okay. There is nothing here, Princess. Check again, Padam kaka. Dive a little deeper. Must be something there. Padam kaka. Padam kaka. Someone's assisting Rukmani. She cannot do it all by herself. Scaring me. Confusing me. It all makes sense. This is just what Rukmani wants. That I start doubting myself and everyone thinks I am mentally unstable. But why would the queen do such a thing? Maybe for the estate. It's done. It was a mistake, Your Majesty. Your Majesty... Motherfucker! -Let her go... -Why, you... Rukmani. Rukmani! Rukmani, spit it out. Spit it out. Spit it. Spit it out. What are you doing, Rukmani? Have you lost your mind? Stop. Control yourself. Snap out of it. What are you doing? I can't do it. I can't do it anymore, Kapil. You can, Rukmani. You can. Think about us. Think about our future. Think about our child. Can you? Can you do it? Yes. This is not the time to break down. Just handle Ashok. Everything will be okay. I love you. Come here. Come. Sorry. I am sorry. -I am sorry. I am sorry. -Stop it. Stop. Stop it, Rukmani. Rukmani. Since she got here, her condition was deteriorating. You know that. I tried to stop her, but she insisted on going back. And when Padam didn't come back, I got worried. Then I sent Kapil to find her. At the railway station, I got to know that she never made it there. What time did she leave for the station? Around 11:00 p.m. The last train from Morbi leaves at 11:30. And the drive to the station is two hours. I... No, sir. She left around 9:00-ish. I remember clearly because I kept her luggage in the car. He is right. Actually, Ashok, I've had a lot on my mind recently, which is why I don't remember clearly. Wait in the car. Yes. Yes. You were trying to say something. The truth, I presume. Rukmani, you can trust me. Ashok... I am scared. Find Meesha. -Jai Hind, sir. -Jai Hind. How tragic. Years later, Meesha returns to meet her father. But they couldn't meet. Fate. Sir. What's the update, Bhavesh? We recovered only one body from the car. QUEEN This could take a while. You may leave. We'll inform you as soon as we find the body. Okay. -Bhavesh. -Yes? Send the body for post-mortem. Yes, sir. And instruct the team to scour every inch of the lake. Yes, sir. Where could the girl go? What happened, Kapil? Why weren't you picking up your phone? I've been calling for so long. Relax, Rukmani. Ashok was watching me. The police found the car. But they have only recovered one body. Padam. -Just Padam? -Yes. And Meesha? Meesha's body? Meesha's body will be found too. Where can she go? Listen, I am going to the police station to record my statement. -Okay? -No, tell me right now. Tell me... Hello? -Hello, Rukmani? -Kapil. Hello? I am scared. Please come soon. Please. Everything will be okay. I am coming. There you are. I tried calling you. Where is everyone? There has been an accident. The entire staff is at the police station, recording their statements. What? Last night, Meesha... She wanted to go back, but... Padam's body has been found. Meesha... Meesha's body is still missing. Rukmani. A dead girl cannot die again. What? Dead girl? Meesha committed suicide a week ago. Her body was recovered from the lake along with the car. I just returned from Mumbai. I personally saw her body at the morgue. Suicide? Yes, Rukmani. That's not possible. She was right here. You saw her yourself. I have no clue. I am confused. This has to be a mistake. It's not possible. -Please believe me. -That's impossible. -Rukmani-- -No! No. That's not possible. That's impossible. Rukmani, please. No. Suicide? Rukmani? Meesha? Meesha. I am not Meesha. Who are you? What's your name, child? Fatima. Always remember. No good deed ever goes to waste. Fatima. I could never forget what he said. Years later, fate made me cross paths with Daata's daughter again. He had changed my life. But his own daughter's life was completely fragmented. There was only one connection between Meesha and Daata. Dr. Shekhawat. He wanted to help Meesha, but he had run out of ideas. Meesha getting admitted to the hospital, running into me... There had to be a reason. Fatima? Maybe life was giving me an opportunity to help the family I owed so much to. But it wasn't that easy. Meesha's heart was filled with pain and hatred. She would feel lonely. But she was ready to break free from the cage she had locked herself in. But, eventually, Meesha and I became friends. And our friendship deepened. She began trusting me. She began seeing her Daata from my perspective. And she was ready to give him another chance. Hello. Daata? Meesha. Years later, Daata and Meesha were going to reunite. It seemed like they were finally going to patch up. The number you are calling is out of network... But fate had other plans. Meesha kept waiting for him, but he didn't show up. A daughter whose trust was broken again took her life because she thought her Daata didn't love her. Then you sent that letter, saying, "Come back home." And when Ratan's number was unreachable, I knew something was wrong. I didn't trust anyone here. And we made a plan. And I came here as Meesha so we could find out the truth. What... What I did was wrong. We were wrong. We shouldn't have done it. Never. Sorry. I am sorry. I shouldn't have done it. I was wrong. I am guilty. I am guilty. Please save my child. No, Kapil. Kapil, stop. Please. Please. -Doctor, get up. -Think about your child. As you said. Think about us. We don't want any of this. -We will leave-- -All this is mine! Mine! Rukmani! Kapil. You want to kill me? You? I should have done this long ago. Rukmani! What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Let me go. All this can be ours. Not us. You. You did it for yourself. Just yourself! Rukmani. Rukmani. Rukmani. Rukmani! Rukmani. Rukmani! Rukmani! Rukmani. Stop! So, finally, you picked up a weapon. We are alike, Fatima. We both grew up on the king's generosity. Right? Let me tell you a story. Don't come any closer. There was a 20-year-old boy. One day he dared to wear the king's expensive suit. Do you know what the king did? He had him stripped naked publicly. -Stop. -Humiliated him. I said stop! He said, "You are not even worth the threads used in this suit." That day I realised it was charity, not generosity. And I also realised we will never get what we deserve if we don't snatch it. And what did you get? What did you gain from all this? You lost everything. You are forgetting, Kapil. Every good or bad decision you make... can have consequences for you someday. Courtesy of Mr. Rana. He slid this into the barrel so the gun would backfire. That night I wondered whether it was wrong for me to come here. What was the point of all this? Several lives were lost, and for what? For a few pieces of land and a little wealth? Then dawn came, and Dr. Shekhawat and I returned to the palace with the children from the Meesha Foundation. That day I realised I wasn't wrong in coming here. This forsaken palace now belongs to these children. Meesha and Daata must be happy wherever they are. NO GOOD DEED EVER GOES TO WASTE. IT ALWAYS MAKES A DIFFERENCE SOMEWHERE.
