WE'RE ALWAYS CONSUMED BY HUNGER. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. THE SECOND AWAKENING OF CHRISTA KLAGES I had to create my own jail before I realised what had happened to me. I had never thought very much about myself, especially not in the last few days. Give me a tenner. I don't have any more. - Where are you going? - You can't ask that. Why not? I'm going to see a friend. She's terribly nosy. I don't know what to do about it. - Is he your friend? - Yes, he's my friend, too. Stop bothering the nice lady. Mummy, listen. These are the most expensive cars in the world. Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, 123,987 DM. Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible, 177,522 DM. Stutz Blackhawk, 150,880 DM. Lincoln Continental Mark Ill, 2 million DM. 2 million? Yeah, the one that was custom-made for the U.S. President. There were three of us - Werner, Wolfgang and me. Wolfgang was the youngest. Please don't get excited, Director. I won't. I'm perfectly calm. The other two got away, but we'll catch them soon. You always used to cry when you were at the station. And do you really think that's going to happen again? You'll send us your sermon as usual, won't you? Yes. I think the taxi's here already. I'm ready. I've put everything in order. Try not to mess it up again. You'll see, it'll be much easier to find things. You could cut your hair a little shorter in the summer, couldn't you? - No. - Do it for me. Thanks, I can manage. - See you in four weeks. - Bye. - Can I give you a hand? - Oh, that's very kind, thanks. You might have thought of that. It wouldn't have hurt. Do you think they got Wolf? No way. He was ahead of me. At his age, I could run 100 metres in 11 seconds. I'll wait here at the pub. If it doesn't come off, I won't have far to walk back. HANS GRAWE - PRIEST - Hello. Are you Mr Grawe? - Yes. I'm Christa Klages, a friend of Wolfgang Prinz... A friend of Wolfgang's? How is he? Come in. Tell me about Wolfgang. Did he find a job? His parents said he was just bumming around. Yes, he's found a job. Mr Grawe, I wanted to ask if my friend and I could stay here tonight. His parents only live 200 metres from here. I'm not here with Wolf. And I've already asked his parents. They turned us down. No, no, I don't have enough room. That doesn't matter. We can sleep on the floor. No, that's my office! I could get you a hotel room. I'd even pay for it. - I sang that cantata once. - Yeah? Not as well, though. We're here for a specific reason. There's something we'd like to discuss with you. The part that's coming up is especially pretty, I think. Yeah? I like it, too. Just one night, OK? All right. I'm teaching a confirmation class. You can come afterwards. That's very nice of you. Because you like the cantata. Don't you have any Italian spices? - On the top shelf. - No, there aren't any. I already checked. My mother was here. It's impossible to find anything afterwards. Could you make room for this? Hang on, hang on. I'm sorry. What's wrong? Aren't you hungry? We thought you would pray first. I don't insist on it. Is it important to you? No, I don't have to pray before I eat. The nuns at boarding school put me off praying. We had to pray around the clock. I'm sure you're exaggerating. No, it's true. It started when they came in to wake us up. A nun came in screaming, "Praise the Lord." We had to get up and answer, "Forever and ever, Amen." And that's how it continued until dinner. "Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest and let these gifts to us be blest." Even Christians jabber like heathens sometimes. So, you're friends with Wolfgang? The Japanese also eat spaghetti, but theirs is slippery and translucent. And what's more, they eat it with chopsticks. He went to Japan as a sailor. Try! You won't be able to do it. That's why I never got enough to eat. Cut them up. - Or you won't get enough tonight, either. - Typical nursery school teacher. - You're a nursery school teacher? - She wants to cut everything up for you. And you're a sailor? - A former sailor. I'm a "former" everything. - And what do you do now? We need your help. We run a day-care centre, you know? We started it three years ago because our ideas about how children should be raised differ from how it's done in most nursery schools. My daughter's in it, too. At first we only had the kids of the people who co-founded the centre. That worked pretty well. But then word got around. Now we have foreign children, which is great, as well as children whose parents can't take care of them, children who would've ended up on the street if it weren't for us. - Welfare children... - I'm afraid I have to go. I almost forgot. I'll be back in an hour. We'll talk about it then, OK? It all sounds very interesting. We don't have those kinds of experiments in the countryside. I'm going out for a drink. Do you think that's a good idea? You shouldn't draw attention to yourself. You just don't want me to go out. - Just say so. Or come with me. - Do what you want. Have you been looking at me long? I'm sorry, Christa, that I got back so late. Where is Werner? Has he gone to sleep? He wanted to go out. I thought you were friends. We are. In what way? I mean, what kind of relationship do you have? You want to know whether we sleep with each other? Yeah, sometimes. That sounds uncomplicated. I envy you. Do you want me to put on a cantata? If you want to. What you said about praying gave me an idea. Read it to me. If you want to hear it, you can come to church tomorrow. At boarding school, I used to masturbate during the sermon. Do you still do that? I don't go to church anymore. What would you do if you no longer got any money for your youth work? Ask the District Board. And if they turned you down? I'd ask the city. What if the city didn't pay up, either? I'd ask the parents. - If they didn't have any money? - I'd think of something. Now I get it. You need money for your nursery school and you want me to help you. Would you be prepared to do that? Of course. I always am, if it's for a good cause. Hey, Wake up! Christa! Where did you get this money from? What are you snooping around for? - We robbed a bank. - Are you serious? Yes, Hans. - Get dressed and leave. - Don't worry, we will. I didn't expect anything else. But first, you need to sign a money order so the money goes where it's supposed to go. Listen, you have to transfer the money to the nursery as an official church contribution or they'll chuck us out. We can't take the money there ourselves. It would be too conspicuous. So you didn't come because you need money, you came because you want me to pretend that I raised it. - The money is needed urgently! - How much money is it, anyway? We haven't counted it. It's not for us. I don't want to see it. It's wrong. And need doesn't make it right. Don't tell us what's right and what's wrong. Just send the money immediately! Otherwise the kids will end up in a home. And you can ask Werner what it's like there. Don't tell him about my life, OK? Well? Are you going to do it? Of course not! If you'd thought about it for one minute, you would have known that. It would take me years to raise that much. Even privately? Christa, the church is like a corporation. I'm only an employee. I have to account for every penny. The only thing I can do is turn the money over to the police, invoking the seal of confession. I'd advise you to return the money, especially if you're worried about the children's well-being. If the situation is that dire, there must be other ways. Forget it. We don't need your sermon. Let's scram. Typical! One of Wolf's ideas... Yes, Wolf was convinced you'd help us. You got Wolf involved in this? You really are a bunch of crooks! Wolf is a dreamer, a naive, loveable kid. You don't know the first thing about Wolf! You always led him around by the nose. So did you! Don't you realise what you've done to Wolf and to yourselves? It was his decision. He was sick of being promised jam tomorrow. By People like you! I want you gone by the time I get back. You're not leaving here. I have to go to mass. - He could report us. - Nonsense! It would be the most sensible thing to do. Dear congregation, must prayer be a meaningless ritual with no substance and with no real hope of what you pray for coming true? Or is prayer just an alibi for one's inaction, a way to avoid one's duties? Rather than doing good, do people turn to prayer? This alternative is described in detail in the famous scene in "Mother Courage" where the peasants' prayer contrasts with Kathrin's drumming. In January 1636, the Protestant city Halle was besieged by the Kaiser's troops and was in great danger. Just outside the city, Mother Courage gathered with her dumb daughter Kathrin and a group of peasants. They await the looming catastrophe. It is night time. The residents of the city are asleep, blissfully unaware. A peasant says to Kathrin, who's without speech: "Pray, poor child, pray. "We cannot stop the bloodshed. "But if you cannot speak, then you can pray." Kathrin climbs up on the roof of a house with her drum. She begins to beat the drum and wakes the town. However, she's shot dead by an approaching soldier. She pays for her drumming, that represents a prayer, with her life. Brecht leaves no doubt as to what the alternatives are. On the one hand, there's the peasant who prays naively to a God who doesn't exist and therefore cannot save the town. On the other hand, there's dumb Kathrin, who doesn't pray but saves the city by beating her drum. But isn't this a contradiction that Christians can resolve? Shouldn't the words of St. Augustine apply, who said, "He who prays well knows how to live well"? For Christians know that this world offers the possibility of salvation, and that we are called to put our faith in its coming to pass. It's more than usual, Father. Your sermon was very good. Truly inspiring. Could you give me a hand? Thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll lock up. You may go now. What have you been doing the last six years? I was a priest. Here. Has anything significant changed in your life in that time? Time doesn't pass very fast in the countryside. It passes very fast for children. Do you know what six years mean to a child? Their entire childhood! You can never make up for what you miss during that time. There are kids for whom we are the only positive thing they've ever experienced. Please don't try to change my mind. And what's gonna happen to me? I've set up this place - I invested all my strength, all my energy. All my ideas. I won't let anyone take it away from me. PHARMACY ON MARKET SQUARE - Hello, Mr Grawe! - Hello. - I need some more aspirin. - OK. - And do you have any hair dye? - Yes. - Blond, two bottles. Something subtle. - Yes. It's for my mother. She's started dying her hair. That's not unusual. I'm 20 and I dye mine, as well. - I'll cut yours afterwards. - No, no. Thanks. Why not? I always cut my husband's. - Your husband's? - Mm. Most girls get married before they see through things. Looks awful! I'm sorry, I don't think I'm very good at this. Have you never had any doubts? There are things that you just don't doubt. It's a very powerful thing to carry on with a tradition. My father's a pastor, as was my grandfather. I see. So you followed the family tradition. Some things only gain meaning when you carry on with them. What my grandfather did gains meaning because I've become a pastor, as well. Doubts and all. If I thought like you, I'd still be a housewife. Like my grandmother and my mother. Doubts and all. There! Clergymen used to be respected. Now people make fun of us. But for me, that's just another reason to remain a pastor. You're a martyr? Playing a martyr can be quite nice, can't it? Why aren't you married? I mean, a pastor needs a pastor's wife. The women I like can't imagine being married to a pastor. Like you. I like you. You can still go back. Both of you can still go back. There are people who need to be given wings. Others need lead in their boots. I wrote something in it for you. I'm sure we'll see each other again. Interesting job, being a pastor. Carries a lot of prestige, too. Statistically, it's the third most prestigious job. Right after professor and doctor. Just admit that you enjoyed talking to him. You always say I talk too much, but you talked with him for hours. "Sleep, dim eyes..." Have you ever talked to me about that stuff? We talk about other stuff. You got your A levels and he went to uni. That's quite a match! You can say farewell with a poem. Don't be stupid. I haven't read any poems for ages. But these are really beautiful. Do you want me to read one to you? No, thanks. I don't need any pastoral care. When I say "get down", you have to get down immediately. Are you crazy? They don't need to see that there's two of us. "They"? There's nobody behind us. Don't turn around! Never turn around. The police drove me to the station once and we were following another car in the police car. The guy in front of us kept turning around. So one of the cops said, "That guy has turned around twice now. Let's take him to task." So they checked his car out. You'd better think about where we're going. To the next good Samaritan. Miss Seidlhofer, would you come here, please? Miss Seidlhofer, was that the woman? People always look different in pictures. Do you think it could be her? Is there a resemblance? Yes, there is a resemblance. But some people look good in pictures and others look awful. I always look awful in pictures because I just don't photograph well. Miss Seidlhofer, how photogenic you are is not the issue here. Please concentrate. She has nice hair. - What's her name? - Christa Klages. What does she do for a living? She worked in a nursery school up to the day of the robbery. It might've been a front, though. There is a certain resemblance. It must be her if, as you say, she's friends with the other two. I can't be sure until I see her. We have to catch her first. The bonus number is 30. SCANDAL: BANK ROBBER IS CHILDCARE WORKER - I can't... - Oh, come on. Werner... You must feel the same way. You know, sometimes I could cry. Not because of me or because of you. Just because of everything. But you're right, there's no use. In the meantime, the second man has been identified. According to the confession of Wolfgang P., it is 28-year-old Werner Wiedemann, presently unemployed, from ltzehoe. Goddammit, why did Wolf squeal on me right away? He's only 19. So what? I was 14 when they got me and I didn't squeal. He's jealous of you because he thinks you're good at everything and he always fails. Nonsense. He was jealous of you. You were the mother he couldn't get close to and you don't rat on your mother. That's why he kept you out of it. I won't score looking like this. I liked you better with dark hair. We'll split up. Without me, you've got a chance. If they catch us together, the game's up. We did the job together, so we'll have to get through this together. Just think! You've got a kid! They can only tie you to it through me. Do you think I'm going to buy myself a Porsche with this? I want us to stay together. Excuse me a minute, please. Nothing my husband does lasts very long. If we weren't married, we'd have split up a long time ago. I'll be right back. Hello, Flo. How did you find me? You're in the directory. Is your husband at home? - No, but I've got a customer. - A customer for what? Beauty treatment. Do you want us to come back in half an hour? - Are they after you? - We're not criminals. Mrs Häkele! Yes, I'm coming. Come on in. This is Werner Wiedemann. This is Ingrid, aka Flo. Take a seat in there. Do you really think that witch is gonna help us? - I'm not staying here. - Where else can we go? I don't care, anywhere. Did you know there were so many different kinds of bat? Look at them, they're all different. Is her husband a taxidermist by profession? No, he's an army officer. Are you crazy? You take me here of all places? - He'll recognise us! - Shh! You really don't need to be afraid, Flo. Did you really do what it says in the papers? Yes, but there's no witness who can identify me, just Werner. You're doing beauty treatments now? Why? Your A levels are useless if you don't go to university. I took this course two years ago and now I can work at home. At home? Why? Do you have children? No, not yet. - And Mischa? How old is she now? - Five. She starts school in autumn. It's great to see you again. How stupid of me to have not been in touch sooner. Just ask her if she's gonna do it or not. I don't wanna stay here another two days. Do what? Just leave us alone, please. Can we use your toilet? First door on the left. Thank you. Werner's reached the end of his tether, you know? There's a bat above the loo. Can't you remove it? Just get lost! I'm sorry, Chris. I've thought about you so often and... I was looking forward to seeing you again. But now that you're here... If Heinz finds out... When does your husband come home? Only at weekends. He lives in the barracks. So we can sleep here tonight? - Don't you want to come along? - No, I'm busy. As usual. Bye. From that day on, Lena Seidlhofer, the bank clerk, began looking for me. Who do you want to see? - I wanted to see Christa Klages. - She's not here. Christa's gone to her mother's and can't be reached. She's going to bring me a present. - Me, too. - Me, too. - She's gonna bring me a big present. - A little one for me. A big one for me. Would you like to eat with us? No, thanks. I'll eat at home. - How many people live here? - Eight. - Ten! - Seven. No, it's eight. Five grown-ups and three children. What about you? Do you live by yourself? It's all right. It's all right... There. I'm fine. I've started buying furniture for the new flat. Of course, we have to put money aside for that. - How much did this place cost? - 300,000. You'll be paying off the mortgage for the rest of your lives! Heinz's job is guaranteed for life. You screamed in your sleep last night. That happens a lot. Sometimes I scream so loud, I wake myself up. You're alone a lot, aren't you? Yes, Heinz only comes home at weekends. And then he goes hunting for bats. - But I've got my customers. - And what about friends? I haven't had a real friend since we lost touch. I've had a lot of acquaintances, but I lost touch with them when we moved. - But once we have children... - Why haven't you had any yet? Heinz wants to wait until he's been promoted. He's right, don't you think? No, I don't. Not if you want to have children. I gave this to Heinz for his birthday. It says, "Please fertilise." I went to see Frieda today I'll go back there tomorrow For there is no one... Quite like Frieda - Oh, I'm sorry. - Come on in! How did you recognise Christa despite the blonde hair? It was the way she laughs. Ah, her laugh... She always laughed like that when the teachers scolded her. She wasn't afraid of them. I was. I wanted to be like her. Can't you give me one of your treatments? It doesn't work without creams. I think I could do with a rejuvenating treatment. Can't you do it from the front? No, not really... It's Ms Wurm. Could you go to the living room, please? You're beautiful. Just look at my thighs. So what? Mine are like that, too. Why did you marry Heinz? He always knows what he wants. And he wanted me. You're a type of woman a lot of men desire. - You are, but I'm not. - I'm too headstrong. I always envied you for that at school. And now? Why did you get married? Hannes and I just got married for fun, really. We didn't want anything to change. But then I realised that all I was doing was copying recipes. YOU? Just like we used to copy poems, do you remember? "Life is building bridges over dying torrents..." "We are nothing. What we're looking for is everything." "Flee disappointment and you flee fulfillment." It's not fair. You get to sleep together and I have to sleep alone with the bats. Would you start all over again? With another man, I mean? Sure. But I wouldn't get married again. Especially not to him. - Hello. - Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you. Are you Christa Klages' mother? Yes, why? I thought I might find her here. No, she's not here. I don't know where she is, either. The police have been looking for her, too, but... You're not from the police, are you? No, I'm a friend of hers. I see. I was just asking because I don't know you. Do come in. Because of the neighbours, you know? Please excuse the way I look. I'm doing amateur dramatics tonight. I'm playing a knight's lady. I'm an ordinary person, really. I'm a public servant, you know? - Do take a seat. - Thank you. I haven't had any peace and quiet since the day it happened. My colleagues have been tearing into my children. I sometimes ask myself, "Why they're so... different?" I have another daughter, as well. She lives in Berlin. Maybe it's because deep inside I'm like them. I don't take things lying down. What kind of life would it be if I did? Yes, Christa really felt cooped up here. That's why she went off to London when she was 19. She took care of other people's children, and she liked it so much that she got a job in a nursery school. It's not for me, though. I want to enjoy life. Raising my own two children was quite enough for me. So now I do amateur dramatics. Don't you wanna come tonight? No, I have to get up early tomorrow. - Do you work in an office? - No, I'm a sales clerk. Oh, won't you come along? You should be having fun. It's a great play. Listen: "O prithee, let thy gracious heart hear my lament "and help me fight the terrible injustice "they have done to me." Since when have you been late for work? Don't tell me, your alarm clock didn't go off. And besides, you've been wearing the same clothes for three days now. It said in the memo that we're supposed to wear different clothes every day. Like the newscasters on TV. I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow. Here, at least put on this cardigan so nobody will notice. Do you finally have a boyfriend? Leave me alone. Miss Seidlhofer, could you bring me the insurance files? Thanks. Sit down, please. What foreign currency did they take and how much? It was $4,000, 5,000 French francs, 5,000 Swiss francs and 1,300,000 Lire. What exchange rate did you use? The rates from the 27th. Let's use the rates from the 25th. But the robbery was on the 27th. We'll use the exchange rate from the 25th. When they catch that woman, we'll get the money back. Won't there be a guaranteed pay-out from the insurance company? Of course, but they'll pay faster if they know who to charge it to. I see, Mr Schlei. Try to get Mischa to come outside so I can at least see her from a distance. Was it because she liked Werner, or was it because of our friendship? Anyway, Ingrid agreed to take the money to the nursery school. We couldn't wait any longer... if it wasn't too late already. - Did you see that woman? - Reingard? Yes. No, the one who came out just after you. What did she want? She came out when I went in. I hardly noticed her. Flo, that was my hostage at the bank! You're staring at me now just like she did during the robbery. Maybe that's why they didn't want the money. What? They didn't want the money? You brought the money back? But why? They need it so badly! They're afraid because you acted on your own. What do you mean, "on my own"? Should I have taken the kids along? Why did we do it in the first place? It can't all have been for nothing! I thought you were coming back tomorrow. Does my flat always look like this when I'm away? I'm sorry, I didn't get round to tidying up. I thought your friends only wanted to stay for two days. Instead, you seem to be catering for them, at my expense. Quite the opposite. They've been catering for me. They even bought you a case of wine. That doesn't give them the right to stay forever. Who slept in my bed? A friend of mine. I want them out of here by tomorrow. What a bastard! Don't interfere! There's a bakery. I'll buy us a few rolls. - Will you get something sweet for me? - Yes. BAKERY / CONFECTIONERY Good bye. What would you like? A loaf of bread and three rolls, please. - You can't park here. - It's not my car. - Not your car? But you were sitting in it. - I have a bicycle. Your ID, please. Halt! Stop! Stop! Stay where you are! Drop that gun! What's the matter? Yes? Would you like some milk? That's very nice of you. - I'll pay for it. - There's no rush. Why don't you come over? It's nice at my place. Is it always the same city? Yes, that's Riga. - My hometown. - Have you lived here long? Oh, a long time. I don't know exactly how long. My memory isn't as good as it used to be. It's nicer here in the summer. Lots of people come out and the place comes to life! But during the winter, I'm almost always alone. You ran away, didn't you? I did that in Riga, too. My parents looked everywhere for me. They were very strict. Please eat. My mother always made vegetable soup for me when I was sick. I still have so much to embroider. So much to embroider... Look at these. I still have all these postcards to embroider. Sometimes I even have to work at night, when I can't sleep. I wasn't sure whether you'd come. - Have you got a gun, too? - Why? Because I don't feel like talking to you if I think you're walking around with a gun after all that's happened. I don't have one. I shouldn't have let you leave like that. - And the money? - You want me to turn it in? I tried to help you, to make you see sense. But apparently you didn't get that. What are you going to do now, Christa? - Keep on hiding forever? - I don't know. I really don't know. I only know that I'm not going to turn myself in. You told me yourself how fast children grow up. If I were in jail, my daughter wouldn't see me very often, either. Then I don't know why you've asked me to come. I don't understand how you found me. You're an old school friend of Christa Klages, aren't you? They killed her friend, that guy called Wiedemann. And how do you know that? Her mother told me. You went to see her? Yes, and her ex-husband, too. Why are you doing this? I have a responsibility towards the insurance company. Why don't you leave the investigation to the police? I won't tell you. You wouldn't understand, anyway. Do you really think you'll be able to find her? Your problem is that you don't think enough about yourself, Christa. Call Erich. Either he'll pick you up or he'll tell you how to get there. I told him that you need help. I didn't tell him why. I just want to stay here with Mischa. You have to go, Christa. Hans is going to take you to the other kids. I have to go now, but I'll be back. You know when I say that I'll be back, I will be back. Take care of yourselves. For the first time, I'm thinking of myself by thinking of you. You'll look just like me, Chris. This is my line of work, after all. If they catch me, just say I stole your passport. Hold still. I won't do that. I was my idea, after all. Promise. There. Now go and get dressed. Hans helped me a second time. He sent me to Portugal, where his younger brother taught at a German school. Tell him I'm very grateful to them for having me. Dear Hans. This is to show I'm really working. I've been here for two months and I still feel like a stranger, yet I feel welcome. Your brother helped me a lot. He comes here from Lisbon once a week and then I can talk to the people. They're friendly towards me, but I don't speak their language. I see how important being able to talk to people really is. They want you to sing a German song. But I can't sing. - Don't insult them. - I can't think of any. Oh, just sing "Am Brunnen vor dem Tore" or "Die Gedanken sind frei" or "Sah ein Knab' ein Röslein stehn". Never! Oh, I think I remember one. Where is Little Jacob? He drove the cows into the woods And never came back again His sister and brother Went to the woods to look for him Calling Little Jacob Little Jacob Come home - Did you have to wait long? - Yes, forever. - It's good to see you. - Yes. Let's have something to eat. I'm surprised Heinz let you go! I'm sure he wouldn't have. I just told him I was going to my mother's. I bought a ticket to Zurich, and from thereto Lisbon. Good thinking. I had trouble at customs, though. The customs official thought I had the stolen passport. But then I explained to him that it had been stolen from me. Did that woman from the bank make contact with you again? Not with me, but apparently she sits around the nursery school after work. She won't give up. Weird! The main thing is you came through for me. - Can you get my jacket? - Yes. We helped the farmers peel cork trees. We did the women's work and picked up all the little pieces of bark. Oh, my back. Mine hurt at first, too. It would be great if Mischa could be here with us. - Do you really want to stay here? - Yes, I like it here. You haven't been screaming in your sleep since you've been here. So it was Heinz after all. You're not scared of him anymore, are you? Since I've been here, I've almost felt sorry for him. I'm touched. You liked Werner a lot, didn't you? As much as you. Werner and I... we were always bickering. We always tore into each other for no reason. And when we got tired of that, we robbed the bank. So it wasn't just for the money? Sure, it was mostly for the money. But maybe if we'd really loved each other, we wouldn't have needed it. Let's go. Look at my hands. All these cracks! I can't massage anybody like that. You should see my knees. If Heinz could only see me now. Christa, I've come here to talk to you. You can't stay here. - Why not? - Manuel heard about the robbery. You didn't tell me about it, either. Hans didn't mention it. That doesn't have anything to do with our work here. Manuel says it's a difficult situation for them. They're closing down some cooperatives and they can't afford to risk anything. - And besides... - What? There's something between you and Ingrid. Manuel didn't want to elaborate. Well, you must try and understand them. The women here think about things differently. They're very old-fashioned. You have to respect that, don't you think? The money and the thought of being able to do something useful with it had kept me going. After I left it in Portugal, I felt paralysed. The former tenant left those curtains here. You can keep them for 100 DM, and that money is payable to me. The tap is leaking, but it will be fixed. - When does your furniture arrive? - It'll be delivered in a few days. I'll fix the tap myself. You're staying here now? I had always tried to take immediate action if things didn't go according to my wishes or plans. I thought I could help myself and others. I didn't think that anymore. WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO GO. WE WANT TO STAY. This one's heavy. You've got to help me. I can't do it by myself. Wow! You're gonna help, aren't you? COMING SOON: FILMS FOR INTIMATE MOMENTS We can put that over there. - Why are you moving out? - Ask him. He's the one who threw us out. Are you the owner? Yes, I am. What were you thinking, evicting these children? Is it any of your business, Miss? They've been in there for three months and no one's paid their rent. But they've made a mess of the place. Just look at it before you make a speech! They are leaving behind a pigsty! But a sex shop is nice and clean, is it? At least they pay their rent on time and they're quiet. They don't scream and shout all day long. Very clean. BEING ABLE TO WAIT Could I speak to Ingrid, please? When can I reach her? I had tried to reach Ingrid several times, but either there was no answer, or her husband picked up the phone and he didn't want to talk to me. I didn't know that he'd thrown her out. Christa, what are you doing here? I thought you were long gone. Are you crazy? What if somebody sees us. I was gone. Where are you now? What are you doing? - All right, don't tell me. - How is Mischa? I haven't seen her since they closed the nursery school. So they threw them out after all? Reingard's trying to continue at your place but there are only a few kids left. - What about Eyip? - I'm not sure. You'd better go. Give Mischa a kiss from me. Take care. Is there nothing I can do for you? "When you are old and grey and full of sleep, "and nodding by the fire, "take down this book, and slowly read, "and dream of the soft look "your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep. "How many loved your moment of glad grace, "and loved your beauty with love false or true, "but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you "and loved the sorrows of your changing face." Why don't you open the door? I'm sick. Go away. I'm responsible here. There's something that has to be fixed. The tap's leaky. And when you move out, you'll have to repaint the walls. You can't leave them like this. They look horrible. Would you like a beer? I can go and buy you one. No, thanks, I don't drink. Are you alone here? Sick? I'm not really alone. I have a daughter. She's five. Haven't seen her for a long time. She needs me. She's starting school in autumn. It won't be long before I move out of here. I was abroad for a long time, you know? And I didn't know where to go when I got back. That's why I couldn't see my daughter. But I'm not really sick. I'm feeling much better. I know where I'm going. You can't live in this place. There was just nowhere for me to go. I'd never had to spend that much time in my own company. I couldn't even get up anymore. It felt like I was never going to get out of that room again. Then I wanted to put an end to the loneliness. I think about Werner a lot and about why it had to end the way it did. I still can't believe it. It's all my fault. No. - You shouldn't say that. - But it's true. We've received two cheques for 1,000 DM with the message, "Even utopias have timetables." Do you know who they're from? That's nice. Hello. Excuse the disturbance, but your neighbour has called again. Your kids are just too loud. You should make sure they're not too wild. It doesn't bother us, but when people complain, we have to come. Be a bit quieter! You can go now. What if they recognised you? I've been hiding long enough. - Christa Klages? - Yes? You're under arrest. Miss Seidlhofer, try to remember. Take a good look at this woman. Could she take off the glasses and stocking? Was that the woman? No, it's definitely not her. THE SECOND AWAKENING
