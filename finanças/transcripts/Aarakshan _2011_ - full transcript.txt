Deepak... Kumar. What is your full name? Deepak Kumar. That's it. Family background? Tell us about your father. I never met my father, Sir. My mother raised me. I see. What does she do? She used to work as a domestic maid, Sir. Now she irons neighbours' clothes. You seem to have scored 58% in 10th grade and 61% in the 12th. But, after joining S.T.M., I topped the B. Sc. Stream with 76%. And in M. Sc., I stood first in the university's merit list. Well... we can see that. But, Mr. Deepak... Kumar, ours will be the most expensive institute in Central India. Children of politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and other VIPs will study here. Our aim isn't merely to provide top class education... but also ensure their overall development. Manners, etiquette, communication skills, body language... Y'know, almost like a... finishing school. You do know what a finishing school is, don't you? No. In fact, this is the first time I've heard of it. I can understand. After all, given your mother's background... Sir, please! You aren't even capable of understanding my mother's background. And, as for manners and etiquette? You can't find a better example of that than me. You've been repeatedly mocking my caste and status... and yet, this paperweight continues to remain here. If it weren't for manners... I'd have branded your institute's name on your foreheads. Thank you, gentlemen. Had you asked me a single question about my subject, you would've realised that... a person's intelligence and performance do not depend on his background. You have obviously forgotten that, given the opportunity... it was a backward caste person who drafted our country's Constitution. It's precisely this despicable mentality that is ruining our country. I can't believe that they studied in this very college. And this is their mindset! I have obviously failed as their teacher. Sir... it's okay. No! It's not okay! I'm sorry that by sending you there I caused you to suffer humiliation. I thought that until your doctorate begins, you could gain some experience. And, it would also reduce your mother's burden. How's her backache now? She's much better, Sir. Do look after her well. Have you mailed your papers to Cornell University? Sir, actually I'd like to do my doctorate under you. Absolutely not! Whatever you needed to learn from me, you have. Time you moved ahead. Yes, Sir. But until you leave for the US, why can't the principal give you a job at his college? Mother... Sir has already helped me so much. Now, if he also hires me, won't people accuse him of favouritism? You're back early, Hariya? Must've sneaked out of the evening class. Isn't it? The teacher himself didn't show up. Don't tell me his goat was stolen again. No, not the goat. This time they say his wife ran away in sheer frustration. Shut up, silly boy! Won't you play the computer game today? No, got to work on important stuff. Don't disturb me. Why, haven't you finished your homework yet? No, I have to submit this today. Go now! Deepu... admit it. You're scared of losing. So, suppose A plus B plus... Panditji, there you go again taking the longer route! Obviously! After all, he is from the intellectual caste of our society. How will he prove that unless he exhibits his extra intelligence? But Sir, my answer is the same as that! Sure. But, why did you need these extra four steps? Sir, but I've memorized every answer. Now, if I try the shorter route, I could lose direction. Ok. Congratulations, Principal Sir. Both Ganesh and Raghav have been accepted into IIT Kanpur. Wow! Well done, well done! However... your real struggle begins now. Have some sweets, Shambhu kaka. To celebrate whose success? Their success. They've got into the Engineering stream. Wow! Whoever studies here is bound to succeed anywhere. So, shall we enroll you too? Come on, what'll I do here? But, you know my daughter Muniya... she is in the tenth grade. As soon as she clears that... I'll plonk her in front of guruji. She will work hard, you'll see... Mark my words, she will become... how d'you say it... a collector! Dad, you aren't allowed. Surely, just one... Ever since the results were declared last week, you've been gorging on sweets. Now no more. You're becoming exactly like your mother, you know that? You said something? Last one! Suppose, A+B+C+D by 2 is greater than or equal to under root A+B... +C+D Did you send your papers to Cornell? Yes. But I won't be going. You will have to, junior professor. Because, you see, I am going to follow you there. Quit dreaming. I'm not going. Alright, don't go to Cornell. But, surely you can come for a movie. What? You're gawking like I tried to molest you. When you ruffle your wet hair and shower droplets all around It feels so good When you part your lips and softly whisper sweet nothings It feels so good Don't float around like a fragrance, just get to the point. Look into my eyes and say it Don't make me wander in dreams In short, just say it Just get to the point Just get to the point It's another feeling When you are around When you turn around and smile in your endearing style It feels so good Don't play around with words, don't fool me with your act Take my hand in yours, come out with those three little words In short, just say it Just get to the point Just get to the point Say something... The weather is great... the lake is beautiful... and so are you... Can't you just get to the point? It's not as bad as it seems. You're looking fit. How about a game of badminton? You've obviously forgotten... that I beat you 21-15 the last time. I suggest you practice some more before challenging me. The moment you come everything seems fine. I am worried about them. Nothing seems to have worked out. They want to start computer classes... but the bank isn't sanctioning their loan. They need a guarantor. The house hasn't been built completely. Listen... If the bank agrees... I'll sign as a guarantor. As for the house, right now they're staying in our new house. But for how long can we pile on to you? They were supposed to be there just for two months... it's already four! Papa, the builder said we'll get possession in three-four months. That's perfect. I don't need the house immediately. The college is giving me a two-year extension. I don't want you to worry. You're the only one I have. But, I can't play badminton today. Tomorrow, definitely tomorrow. I'll be here. - I'll only be a minute. - Make it quick. Guruji? Guruji, guruji... Greetings to you. You can't leave unless you have some tea. Shambhu, some other day. I'm in a rush today. It'll only take a minute. Listen... make some tea. She works very hard. And, all on her own. - Greetings guruji. - Bless you. What's going on here? - Greetings guruji. - Bless you. Oh my God! What is this high-sounding formula? - What is this? - It's Bernoulli's equation. I know, but what exactly does Bernoulli's equation mean? - Make sure you keep the house clean. - Yes. - You do light A lamp at the altar, right? - Yes, everyday. - Namaste. - Namaste. - Take care. - Ok. So, What did we learn? When air passes between two strips of paper at high speed... like this... the pressure between them decreases and... they fall in love. That means, even aeroplanes fly using Bernoulli's principle. Absolutely... Q.E.D. Oh yes, Q.E. D is Quod Erat Demonstrandum. Oh no, no, Q.E.D. Means... Quite Easily Done! Well, that was quite easily done. Absolutely! I'm Sanjay, Sir. Commerce, 2002 batch. Sanjay... Sanjay Tandon! Banking Services. I'm a senior manager here, come in, please. Please sit. Indradev, please call for some tea and get their papers. The papers? Sir, I am so happy you've come here. Sir, even I tried to get into S.T.M. I wanted to become a scientist. But I didn't score enough at the state level exams. I worked hard in college and scored well in the B. Com. Exams. And I got a job here, in the reserved category. I see. It's only through hard work that we win respect. Yes, Sir. It was my good fortune that I got to meet you today. It was a pleasure meeting you too, Indradev. Ram, Sir. Indradev Ram. Thank you, Sir. - Thank you. - Thank you. If there is any problem, let me know. Now work sincerely. I want to see my friend happy. Yes, uncle. Sushant, can't you wait? But, I'm starving! Wait for Deepak to come. He'll eat when he gets here. Why should I starve to death? The parathas will go cold if you open the container. Oh I see... such glorious love! Now that he is going to the US... for whom will you bring hot parathas? That leaves only... me! Then the parathas are mine and so are... You wish! Take a look in the mirror! Why? Is it worse than Deepak's? Deepak Kumar, I'm extremely pleased to appoint you as a Junior Lecturer at S.T.M. Congratulations. Thank you, Sir. I'm proud of you. Come on. This is where Deepak lives? Why didn't you tell me you live in such a narrow lane? I could barely get my car in! But I had built a special helipad for you on the roof. Little did I know that you'd come by road. I would've happily come but your Poorbi is scared of flying with me. Sushant! You can't even walk properly... and you're talking of flying. Oh yeah? Make it fast, ok? Shanti... how are you? I'm good. When it comes to a party, you conveniently forget your leader. Just some snacks for the kids. - Namaste, aunty. - Hello. Deepak got a job. Oh, this is just a temporary job, aunty. Once he completes his doctorate in the US, he'll get his real job. All of us are in for great jobs soon. No one can stop the Supreme Court from... granting 27% reservation for seats in higher education. 27% reservation for whom? And, where will it come from? Greetings Sir, please have a seat. It is I who should be greeting you. You are a model for the backward castes... and great is your principal... for going out of his way to help backward caste kids. It's not like that. He helps everyone. That's indeed the highest of truths, Deepak. Our principal's heart overflows with kindness for one and all. And his perennial intention is to furnish each individual with a modicum of opportunity. Modicum of opportunity? Meaning that he gives everyone a chance. Then why don't you say chance? That's exactly what I indicated. Did you guys hear what Pandit here just indicated? Chance! Spread your wings and you'll take flight Give me a chance and you'll have the sky in sight Spread your wings and you'll take flight Give me a chance and you'll have the sky in sight Draw a starting line, one for all Draw a starting line, one for all And you'll know if courage or God is above all Just give me a chance Just give me one chance, my dear, oh my dear And watch me take flight Just give me one chance, my dear, oh my dear And watch me take flight Just give me one chance, my dear, oh my dear And watch me take flight Give me a chance, please Give me a chance, please Chance Just give me a chance It showers it's glow with every step Let me see your moves My sweet darling Take it, take it all Just one chance The one who owns the bat and the ball He writes the rules and wins it all How long will you keep this up this game? Why don't you set up a stadium of hope? Just one chance Watch me as I step on the field Watch me as I step on the field You will see my aspirations flying high Just give me a chance Just give me one chance, my dear, oh my dear And watch me take flight Just give me one chance, my dear, oh my dear And watch me take flight Just give me one chance, my dear, oh my dear And watch me take flight Watch me take flight Watch me take flight Just one chance Panditji? What have you scored? 85.3%, Poorbi. Wow! That means you are definitely getting into Engineering. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Glory to K.K.! Congratulations, Sir. Three new courses this year! - Namaskar. - Namaste. You are God, sir. My son had flunked twice but with your help he cleared the exam. We feel blessed, Sir. Now your brother, the minister, will take care of things. I won't go to any college but S.T.M. Sir, but you're a professor at S.T.M. Please use your clout. We'll pay any amount. There's nothing I can do! Without S.T.M. Life is meaningless. He will commit suicide, Sir. Only the Minister can save him then. Come, please come... Hello... Please sit. Deepak Kumar and Kamlesh Narayan. It's my pleasure to introduce these two new junior lecturers. Go, meet them. Welcome... Why are you wasting your time here, Mr. Deepak Kumar? Make use of the reservation rule. The government is doling out jobs to you people in charity. It's you people who've been living on charity, Sir. By snatching from us what is rightfully ours. But now, when you have to give it back, it hurts, doesn't it? You are the Minister for Education, you practically run the government. But you can't get admission for your only nephew? Oh stop crying, please! I'm getting it done. Sir, it's impossible at S.T.M. No one can do that. Why is it so difficult, Verma? Sir, over the past 35 years, Principal Prabhakar Anand has... nurtured the college in every way on his own. Even the government can't interfere. Last year, he refused admission to the Home Secretary's daughter. Really?! In that case, I have to meet this principal. Aniruddha Prasad is the Secretary of the S.T.M. Trust. Let's have a word with him. Yes, please do. We've got more than 10,000 applications this time. Hello... The first cut off list is 94%. Your daughter has scored 76%. It's impossible, Navneetji. You've made millions as a Secretary in the government. Time to put it to use. You can buy a seat in any college for your daughter! Aniruddha has come with the Minister for Education. Baburam Chaudhary, the Minister for Education. Namaskar. It's great to see that you go for a run in the morning, Sir. No wonder that even the college is in such terrific shape. What has your nephew scored? His score is low. But, in any case, no one in our family ever managed to score above 40%. But all thanks to K.K. Coaching... they made him slog at memorising everything... and he scored 52.07%. I'm sorry but I can't help you. Don't say that, Sir. Please don't say that. He is my sister's only son. He doesn't want anything except S.T.M. If you'll kindly excuse me... I have some things to take care of. Aniruddha, please look after him. Sir, just listen to me. Oh! So this is where you run your private coaching. But why are you taking classes in your backyard? I have lots of space in my commercial complex. You can hold your classes there. Your name will attract the students. You can mint money. Mr. Minister, our college pays good salaries. Moreover, we are not allowed to give private tuitions outside. You mean all this is for free? Please come... Have I upset him? Don't worry, Sir. I'll speak with him. You advise people to pay for admission outside. Why not have that system in your college? Mr. Minister, you? You should've sent for me. Damodar Seth... you are a Senior Trustee at S.T.M. For years, I have got you contracts worth millions... from the Education Department. And yet, you can't get my nephew admitted? That's precisely the problem. The principal controls the admissions completely. So that's a 'no'? If the boy's grade is low, take money for the admission. Why are you ruining his career? Moreover, the college is losing millions. What sort of education is this? Don't worry. How can I not? My nephew's career is at stake. I'll have the Chief Minister call the founder member Shakuntala Thakralji. The Chief Minister began his political career through her party. Your principal won't be able to refuse her. Sir, Shakuntala quit everything worldly 32 years ago... to live in an ashram in Hrishikesh. There's no way to contact her. Listen, don't worry. I'll take care of your nephew's admission. I just had a word with the Chairman. At the next board meeting, we'll cut the principal down to size. Appoint your own man there, Damodar Seth. It will work wonders. There's no business like education! Paid service - without guarantee. Students will pay the fees through their noses and then be responsible for their own results. You've reduced the Trustees to nothing more than a rubber-stamp, Principal Sir. Damodarji, the agenda... You have admitted 11 students with 52-55%, just because they are "underprivileged". But, you won't accept a single recommendation of ours. Damodarji, no one is rejected. All applications are still under consideration. According to me, they should be rejected. Will you kindly enlighten us, why? The 11 students you mention have studied under very difficult circumstances... without any facilities or coaching classes and yet managed to get those scores. If you compare them to the children of ministers, bureaucrats and rich families... who have access to good teachers, schools, facilities and coaching classes... and yet score only 52.07%... pray tell, how I can consider them as deserving. Should you ever recommend a weak but deserving student... I shall never disappoint you. That was one fine speech, Principal Sir. But S.T. M belongs to a private trust created to... help the children of our caste come up in life. For the poor and the backward castes there's the government. Forgive me, Damodarji. Your views are fatal for the principles of S.T.M. S.T.M. Was established with the sole purpose to offer... the best possible education to every deserving student... regardless of caste, religion, class or community. But, if you people have decided to go against that purpose... I regret to say, I can't be with you anymore. Prabhakarji, our views are no different from yours. Damodar is merely saying that the Trustee quota should be respected. Noted. The next proposal is to... appoint a permanent Vice Principal to replace Kamta Prasad. Excuse me, but why do we have to decide on this now? Kamta Prasad is still there. Moreover, Dinkar Paswan is doing that job. Prabhakarji... surely you don't intend to... appoint Dinkar Paswan as the permanent Vice Principal? There are other teachers more senior and more qualified than him. I propose that Dr. Mithilesh Singh will be most suitable as the Vice Principal. Highly qualified and dedicated. I support the recommendation fully. Please call him in here. Ok. Come in, Mithileshji. It's our pleasure to appoint you as the new Vice Principal of S.T.M. I... will try my best to not disappoint you. Congratulations. I'm certain that I will continue to receive your co-operation. Trust me. Thank you very much for my nephew's admission Mr. Vice Principal. All I want is your blessings. Now you just watch how we take you to great heights. How many coaching centres do you operate currently, Mithilesh? Seven, sir. What if we raise that to 27? Excuse me? The Minister will set up K.K. Coaching centers in all his commercial complexes. And then in every district. I already have a plan for a University on my 110 acres on Agra road. This is the Saraswati Centre of Education! World Class - Medical, Commerce, Engineering, I.T. Every bloody subject! The investment will be to the tune of 12 billion rupees. Time for you to establish a business empire of education. Consider it done. By God's grace. Within a year we'll list it on the stock market. And then get at least 50 billion from the public! God is great! What are you doing here? I'm asking you! I am putting my knowledge of science to good use. And who will attend the Engineering college classes? I missed out on the admission by a mere 1%. But your name was in the merit list! Yes, I was the last one in the merit list. But the complicated policy of reservation denied me my rightful seat. My life is ruined. Relax, Pandit. Even if you didn't get admission into Engineering... Life is meaningless! It's either Engineering or I'll sweep the streets! No, but... Where did you get these? Sleeping pills? Are you planning to commit suicide? This guy is dangerous! He'll send us to prison. Don't let him get away. What's the meaning of this? You can?t just barge in like that. Sorry sir, but this is urgent. We are students of S.T.M. I am principal Prabhakar's daughter. Oh. How can I help you? Injustice! I mean, you can stop this injustice. He had the last spot on the admission list. However, since a backward caste candidate scored higher... he was bumped off the list. I can't do anything about it. It's just bad luck. Bad luck? Sir, his life will be destroyed. He is contemplating suicide. Sorry, the rule is that if a backward caste student scores... enough to compete in the open category... then he gets admission through that category. Even if that means a wasted seat in the reserved category? Those are the rules. I can do nothing about them. Sir, his father is a janitor in our college. He has studied against very difficult odds. I do understand... but this is the system. To hell with the system, Sir! What? Nothing. Thank you. See, don't lose heart. Apply to the Padmavati Institute of Engineering. Sir, but the fees... are 500,000 rupees. Payable in advance. Even my retirement fund... Don't worry. Just apply. You will get a scholarship. I... I will personally recommend your case to the Dwarka Das Foundation. Sir... Don't do that, please... You are God for us. Sushant? Son, what have you done? You've changed your stream once again? Dad, how does it matter? I want to go to Jamia University. I have already appeared for the entrance test. And you think you will get admission there? Of course, dad. Listen, forget about Jamia and study commerce. It's business that is - Dad, I don't want business. I want to do Mass Comm, and that's it! In that case, you can forget about Jamia. This is their admission list... and your name doesn't feature in it. 51.5% seats are reserved at Jamia. And, you thought admission would be easy there? But dad, I put in a lot of effort. Even the personal interview went well. Son, you can forget about government-supported institutes. Reservations reign supreme over there. Let's make it quick. I've three more lectures to go. You're late again! Sharma Sir gave notes on Quantum today. Check the Sachchar and Sachchar text. They have the best notes on Quantum. What's wrong? Here, you take half. 50-50. Why are you letting go even 50%? Why don't you people keep it all? 100%. What did you say? You heard me. Finally, the historic ruling that everyone was impatiently waiting for has been arrived. For 60 years, we have had 22.5% reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. However, the recommendation of the Mandal Commission that... the Other Backward Castes be given another 27% reservation, was under a cloud. Now, the Supreme Court has cleared that too. So, now the reservation in higher education and government jobs will be 49.5%. These caste-based reservations have caused... deep satisfaction as well as severe discontent in the country. The so-called upper castes are perturbed by the developments. This is Abhay Raichand with cameraman Akhilesh Singh. What do you think will happen? If they do our work, we'll have to do what they were doing. We'll have to leave our studies and take up shoe-polishing now! What else can we do? These are dark days. And so it shall be that... the swan will get discarded grain... while the crow will be fed pearls. In this democracy, everyone is meant to have equal rights. We believe in merit... not in reservation. We're for merit... against reservation! Brothers, these are those very people... who never allowed us to even sit beside them. But, now that the Supreme Court's decision has arrived... they're screaming their lungs out that everyone has equal rights in a democracy. Don't fall into their trap. If they had their way, they would never allow any change whatsoever. Glory to the Supreme Court! Hail, Lord Mandal! Time to pack our bags and leave. Now these people will rule. Security... shut the gate and lock it. Lock it. Now! This is the problem with our country. Everyone has the freedom to stage his own circus. They are deliberately dancing outside our gate. Disgusting. What are they doing? Close the gates. Throw them out. Immediately send the police to S.T.M. Thousands of rioters have gathered here. Yes... hurry! What is the need to call the police, Sir? They will leave now. Of course, they'll leave. Either on their own or by getting kicked out. You guys don't know any other language, anyway. Whoever's gone out should not come back in. Sushant, what are you doing?! Let them back in. You also go out... go dance with them. Have you lost it? No, I haven't. In fact, I've finally realised that... For Merit... against Reservation! Hold on. What's happening? Stop it. Sushant, have you gone mad? You shut up! And get out of here!! Don't even think about it. We haven't forgotten how to drive cattle! You will regret it. Stop it! Stop it! For Merit... against Reservation! Stop it! I said, shut up! For Merit... against Reservation! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! It's okay, officer. You may leave. Thank you very much. Bring our students in. Come on in. Get inside! Everyone! Gather at the assembly... now! Who called the police? Who called the police? The manner in which a riot was breaking out, I... We have never needed to call the police in this college. And, without my permission you will never do so again. The situation was... Never! Never again! Am I understood? Yes... Sir. I will never tolerate anyone who breaks discipline. I want the names of all those students who were at the gate. You will never do this again! Today you have brought disrepute to this institution. Sushant Seth... Deepak Kumar. Your irresponsible conduct has shamed this college. Sir, the fault is theirs. Just a minute. Listen to me! Sir, I... Listen... listen to me! And listen carefully. This is my last warning to you... and to those with you. I will not tolerate this hooliganism! I won't hesitate to expel you two from this college. What is this? Tickets for Yoga classes. I'm busy. But, it's an evening show. Please... Can't you forget what happened? It's a 1000-year old story, Poorbi. Repeated everyday - a million times! Even if I want to, I'm not allowed to forget. Hey! An email from Cornell! Your paper's been accepted! You're going to America! Congratulations. Thanks. Don't we even have the freedom to celebrate openly? Shame on us! It's shameful that Sushant was let off! But we won't tolerate it anymore... no matter who it is. Shut up! What are you crying revolution now for? The Supreme Court has already created history. No matter how much the upper castes jump and dance now... no one can erase the stamp of 27%! It's sealed now! They'll know tomorrow morning. Just watch! RESERVATION IS OUR BIRTHRIGHT! Oh God! Who has done this? Who has written this? Who has written this?! If you have the guts, step forward! These people will never get it. They're like cowardly snakes... strike and scurry back into the burrow. Something will have to be done about them. Whoever has done this, it's not right. Chhotu, get me a bucket of water. Where's the need to erase this, Mr. Deepak Kumar? Just tweak it a little bit. Instead of 'reservation', write 'charity'. 'Charity is our birthright.' For 60 years, we've suffered the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe reservation. And now, the Other Backward Castes! Our children slog throughout the year... but when it comes to admissions, you just rake in the loot! Scared of working hard, aren't you? Really?! You'll teach us hard work, will you? What else have we done until now? If you've forgotten, go read your history again. Then you'll know who slogged... and who looted it like it was their birthright. For centuries you people filled up your coffers with handouts... and you accuse us of living on charity? We ploughed your fields... we reaped your corn, grazed your cattle... we carried your daughters and wives' palanquins... we cremated your corpses... stitched your shoes, drove your oxen, rowed your boats... cleaned your filthy drains... and we even carried your shit on our heads. And you're going to teach us hard work? You're absolutely right. That's all that you're good for! That is all you're worth. And you deserve to be like that. Here, we're talking about building our nations' future. And only the deserving will get a position. But you guys want everything free of cost. The truth is that you are scared of competition. Which competition are you talking about? The one that you never let us participate in? The door of every school was closed for us. And, if we got in somehow, we were relegated to the back benches. You controlled all the schools... the hospitals... police stations... every support system belonged to you! Do you know why you never let us compete? Because you were afraid of a level competition... not us. Don't use history to hide your weaknesses. Nothing of this sort happens in our generation. If you have the guts, accept the challenge and fight. But you won't do that. Because, for that you need merit - which you clearly don't have! We're ready to compete with you on merit. But the starting line for the race should be the same for everyone. First, tell your pop to vacate his ancestral mansion and live in our slums. Ask him to wear a company uniform and go to work as a driver, a doorman or a cleaner. Tell your mother to leave her air-conditioned house and... accompany our mothers to clean other people's homes. Tell your sister that, as soon as she wakes up every morning... to fetch water from the municipal tap in the neighbourhood. Come with us! Sample our lives. And then lecture us! We will compete with you on merit too. But until you do all that... keep your ridiculous hogwash to yourself! In spite of the severe last warning yesterday... you were misbehaving again toay. It's obvious that you don't respect the code of conduct of this college. Sushant Seth, for your unruly conduct... I hereby rusticate you from S.T.M. Sir, you can't do this! I haven't misbehaved in any way. In fact, yesterday I was just trying to stop them. And I was doing the same, today. They create a ruckus, damage college property... they abuse us... they openly destroy S.T.M.'s reputation... I will not be a mute spectator in all this! And, since when have you been appointed the security chief and moral guardian here? If you had any complaint, why didn't you come to me? That would have made no difference, Sir. You would never have taken any action against Deepak Kumar. Everyone knows that! What?! Out! Get out of here! Now!! Sir, even you are supporting those people who are ruining our lives. Sushant, what...? Sushant, what happened? Get lost! Sir, I had no intention of getting into an argument with anyone. Least of all with the Vice Principal. But, given the kind of remarks that were made there... it became impossible for me to remain silent. Can I know what your compulsion was? My identity, Sir. Sushant and Mithileshji were repeatedly insulting our caste... our people... Your people?! Since when did you begin speaking this language of caste politics? You are a teacher... who should be above such things. It's easy for you to say that, Sir. But, my birth leaves me no choice. For centuries, we have endured abuses and insults. Now, we will not tolerate it anymore, Sir! It is incredible that a teacher is using such language. You're repeatedly violating the discipline of S.T. M.... Discipline? Sir, our entire society is struggling with a historic upheaval outside... and all you can think of is discipline?! You will not speak to me like this! Alright, Sir. But, just answer one question of mine. What is your stand on the Supreme Court's verdict? I haven't called you here to debate... Sir, you can't ignore this question anymore. If you're not for reservation, then you're against it. There is no safe middle ground left. What is your position? I do not have to explain my position to you. And for this misconduct, I will take disciplinary... What else can I expect from a place like this, Sir? Here, I will be punished for telling the truth. But, no action will be taken against those... who flagrantly violate the rules of S.T.M.! Look. Your Vice Principal. He openly runs K.K. Coaching Classes. He earns millions but all his sins are forgiven, Sir. After all, his identity is different from mine! Are you making an allegation of casteism against me? Are you trying to accuse me... of being a casteist? Thank you... for holding such an opinion of me. Thank you... very very much. Now you may leave. And, never try to come before me again. Ever! So... leave. Leave! Why aren't you answering my calls? You'll have to apologise to my dad! Have you come here in this rain only to tell me this? Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you talk to my dad like that? I will not tolerate anyone hurting my dad. Even if it is you! Do you know what it means to be hurt? Or, do you follow the same system: First inflict hurt. And, then get the victim to apologise? I can't believe that you are talking like this. Deepak Kumar, whatever you are today is because of my dad. You owe everything to him! That's true. I am who I am because of him. And no matter what I do, I can never repay him. But, today I realized what a great burden that is. So, whatever my dad did for you has now become a burden?! Have you forgotten those years when he stayed up full nights preparing you for your exams? I haven't forgotten anything. But, I feel that he does all that as charity. And charity can't bring real change in society. Poorbi... by giving a blanket to a poor man, you might remove the poverty that is inside you. But, not his. I haven't come here to listen to your arguments. Will you apologise to my dad or not? I'm asking you... Will you apologise or not? Fine. Then, understand this clearly. I never want to see you again. Ever. Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Which cord do you lean on, which cord do you sever This beautiful life says why do you share me Which cord do you lean on, which cord do you sever We sowed crops with lot of effort We picked the best seeds of the lot Watered the soil with a lot of care And that's when the sprouts smiled Fate can very cruel Fate can very cruel But who can scold it But who can scold it Which cord do you lean on, which cord do you sever Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life The mind seems lost in the wilderness Leaves scattered all around The river is lashing against its banks The heart awakens from its slumber Storms may come and go Storms may come and go Silence alone is eternal Silence alone is eternal Which cord do you lean on, which cord do you sever... Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Oh beautiful life Namaste Sir. Good morning, Sir. Whose class is this? Sir, the Vice Principal's. He must be on his way. You people read your notes until then. He won't come, Sir. Sir, he rarely comes to class. For the last three weeks, not even once. Excuse me... Yes, sir? Where can I find Mithilesh Singh? Sir, in the classroom... There? Yes, Sir. ...by 12 n is equal to 416.6 mn. Right? Please look up the answer in your 'guess' paper. Sir, it's actually my brother's class... but he is ill, you see... I was only... tr... trying to help... You can ask the students. Please report at the college. And come to the principal's office. Sir, you... Come to the principal's office. Prabhakar, please think calmly before you take any action. In brazen violation of the rules of this college... you are running a commercial coaching institute, Mithilesh Singh. You're the victim of a misunderstanding, Sir. First of all, K.K. Coaching which you visited this morning... doesn't belong to me. It belongs to my cousin... Krishna Kumar... K. K. And, second... even you run a coaching class in your back verandah. People like you won't understand the difference. I run classes in my verandah because... in our college, we are unable to offer special help to our weak students. Whereas teachers like you... deliberately miss lectures and thereby... force students to take private commercial coaching for your profit. And that, Mr. Mithilesh Singh, is the difference! I work FOR the college. Whereas you... work AGAINST it. You are being served with a 'show-cause' notice. In seven days, explain why you shouldn't be suspended from the college. Prabhakar... Seven days! In seven days, I want an answer. You will get your answer. Most certainly. Dr. Prabhakar Anand... Sir. Prabhakar, what are you doing? That, which your Board hasn't for the last 11 years. If you people had approved my proposal for remedial classes... and had organized free coaching for our weaker students... we wouldn't have had monsters like K.K. Coaching! You're well aware of how these people are swallowing up our entire education system. But, what you propose is not feasible either, Prabhakar. And, you know it. Morever, S.T.M. Is a private college. Why, even the government doesn't do that! Then why doesn't it?! Why isn't it investing most on its most valuable asset... education? In this country, we make the I.A.S., Indian Foreign Service... medical, management, engineering and every such career so attractive! But, that which prepares students for all these, is totally neglected! Like I.F. S and I.A. S... why don't we have an I.T.S. - INDIAN TEACHING SERVICES... to attract the best talent for the job! Aniruddha, this parallel education system... which thrives on capitation and private coaching... will destroy everything! Sir, first you rusticated Sushant Seth, and now Vice Principal Mithilesh Singh. He has alleged that you... Dad, Mithilesh Sir had called a press conference... where he said some very nasty things against you. I think that is why the editor of Dainik Bhaskar, Arvind Kamal is here. He's inside. Your Vice Principal Mithilesh Singh has accused you of being autocratic. And alleged that when he opposed this, you suspended him. He's lying! Please, my dear... I haven't suspended him yet. For regularly breaking the college's rules, I've issued him a show-cause notice. Which rules has he broken? Mr. Arvind Kamal, I don't consider it appropriate to explain my disciplinary actions... through a newspaper. But, his allegation is very serious, Prabhakar Sir. S.T.M. Is a private college where the rule of reservation doesn't apply. But, according to him... your admission policy is doing precisely that. You declare a high cut-off percentage but... admit backward caste students through the backdoor, so to say. See, I am a teacher. My responsibility towards each child is the same. Proud as I am of my successful and privileged students... I am equally concerned about the weaker and... poor students of our society. Two Indias co-exist in our country... Mr. Arvind Kamal. And, if we want our country to genuinely progress, then... we shall have to eliminate the gap between the two. But, is caste-based reservation the only way to do so? Well, if we believe that, for centuries... injustice has been caused because of caste-discrimination... then justice should also be served bearing caste in mind. But what about those children who have never believed in casteism? Who have achieved good results through hard work? But, who now may not get admission because of this new reservation policy! Today, every teacher, every college... as well as the government is facing a big challenge. On the one hand, they have to give due opportunities to the... backward castes, and encourage their talent. But, on the other hand, they have to be sensitive to the plight of those students... who feel they are at a disadvantage in this new scenario. It is evident that you support the Supreme Court's ruling. I cannot answer that question in the words... that you expect me to! However, I will say that if... we accept this decision in all honesty, without making a political issue of it... then it will benefit our society. So, would you want this reservation policy to be implemented in... private colleges and institutions as well? Like S.T.M., for instance? I don't have the right to comment on this. Thank you. Dad, don't you feel that this reservation policy will prove harmful? What're you trying to say? You say that the backward castes will get a chance to improve their lot... That it'll reduce the gap between us... It'll create equality... But, the fact is that distances are increasing. People are becoming enemies of one another. That is indeed unfortunate, my dear... but it's bound to happen, I'm afraid. Whenever change has come about in a society... a price has had to be paid for it. How can you be so sure that you are right? What could be wrong about providing equal opportunity to everyone? It is wrong! Your method is wrong. Meaning? If you really want the backward castes to progress... then give them the best possible primary education. Build special schools for them... big hostels... offer scholarships... Provide them every facility and train them to compete! Why have this... policy of reservation?! What you're recommending should be done in any case. But, that is precisely what we haven't done in 60 years. Hence, reservation becomes even more essential. That section of our population, which is backward simply because of their caste... must surely be given a small window of opportunity! Look here, I'm a mother. Not Mother India! So, first and foremost I will be concerned about my own child. That is my duty! For me, if a rule threatens her future, then it is just plain wrong. That's it! Is that so? Thank you! The ploy worked perfectly, Mithilesh. The Principal made a statement in support of reservation. Now you just watch. If he is not reduced to begging on the streets, you can change my name! But, I don't think you should take this reservation policy lightly. Baburam Sir, it won't make a jot of a difference. When seats in the open category decrease, competition will increase. And, that is when people will turn to coaching and private colleges. This is 'shining' India! Here people of high society... are willing to pay any high cost... for higher education! Moreover, the reservation rule may get these people admission. But, to move ahead in that too they'll need to spend big money! Cheers! What is this? S.T.M. SHOULD HAVE RESERVATION: DR. PRABHAKAR ANAND Those words aren't mine. You mean you didn't say that you support reservation? As a teacher, I did express my personal opinion. But S.T. M... Personal?! Your opinions are personal as long as you don't speak. You're the voice of S.T.M. Whatever you say will be taken as S.T.M.'s policy! You'll have to retract this statement, Prabhakar. That you support reservation - you'll have to withdraw that opinion. I don't consider it necessary to do any such thing, Aniruddha. Whatever I said... has deep thought and my conviction. You are misunderstanding this. Oh, we've misunderstood him alright all this while. But tell him... politics won't be allowed in this college. I was thrown out of college, I kept quiet. But this deceit won't be tolerated. They'll cancel our seats and insert a quota system here too. I think we should speak with Prabhakarji once. Chairman Sir, what is left to be discussed? Call for an emergency meeting of the trust and get rid of this arrogant fellow! We've had enough! Damodarji, a big action like this will impact S.T.M.'s reputation too. Why can't you people see that he is playing politics? Damodarji... Listen, let me try to speak with him one more time. Yes, that'll be best. Yes, Sunny? When did this happen? Take care of your mother. I'm coming across. Not as a trustee today... but I'm speaking as a friend. Till date, I've never insisted on anything with you. But, today for once... just for once, please do what I ask. On Monday, there's an emergency meeting of trustees at 10 A.M. I've drafted a brief clarification on your behalf. Please sign it. Please! Prabhakarji, this statement of yours has put our college in a serious situation. What is your agenda? To support reservations? The newspaper printed that statement out of context. The principal is retracting his statement. It is my good fortune that I had the opportunity to... serve Shakuntala Thakral College for 35 years. However, it is clear now that... your love... and your trust... is no longer available to me. It is time for me to move on now. Thank you and... my best wishes. Prabhakar... The Board has appointed Mithilesh Singh as the principal, Sir. He will destroy everything, Sir. Sir! Please don't go. Please come, Mithileshji. You've come at the right time. I personally wanted to welcome you to the principal's chair. Thank you. Thank you. But this chair's tenure has ended with yours, Dr. Prabhakar Anand. I'm calling for a new chair! Sure... whatever. I hope that you'll take S.T.M. To even greater heights. My best wishes are with you. Certainly! And it is also certain that I'll never let it fall from those heights. Neither of them is answering their phone. We can?t just suddenly ask them to vacate the house. But, surely they can arrange an alternative in a week or so. Dad, this is the street. Look, there's Shambhu's stable! Greetings, Guruji. Yes, greetings... Guruji, what's the matter? All this luggage...? Yes, we had to come to our house all of a sudden... but... That is your house! B 47. But some people put up these signboards last night.
