Daddy got what you need right here, come on. Woo! That's right, go on, get down. Uh, you know that's the best, right? Look, ladies, look what the cat drug in. Get outta here. Hey, hey, hey! My money. You guys a day late and a dollar short. - Yeah, we got a proposition for you, Ringman. - Neither of you guys cute enough to give me a proposition. (laughs) - No, I'm talkin' about a business proposition. - What, which one of you paranoid motherfuckers is gonna get shot first, how's that for a fuckin' proposition? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - You've been owing me money for a long time, and I'm gettin' fuckin' tired of waitin' on it. - I know, I know. Show him, man. - When'd you guys get into export? - We got our hands in a whole bunch of businesses, man. You interested? - How much of this shit you got? - We got two and a half kilos. - Those are some large numbers. Oh, I know you guys ain't bullshittin'. - Come on, man, I'm not gonna play games with you. - Well, I'm a business man, and I'm willin' to let bygones be bygones. But this is some real shit you talkin' about. It's not the kinda shit you wanna fuck around with. See, there's somethin' maybe you don't know about me. I'm one of them motherfuckers that don't give a fuck. 'Cause I got no pain threshold. The word mercy ain't in my motherfuckin' vocabulary. Death really fuckin' amuses me. - We get the picture. - Do you? Then call me when you get the shit. - Alright. (sighs) So what do you think, think we can pull this shit off, man? - Relax, the stuff's at the clubhouse, I'll call Blackie. Just do me a favor, give me some of the good stuff. - Alright. Just don't do all of it, alright, man? It makes you weird when you do it. - We're rippin' off our own brothers, I need this shit. - Alright, but no killin', okay? - Yeah, okay. - Don't go "yeah, yeah." You don't kill our brothers, alright? - Okay, no killing.

Impossible. (muffled radio chatter) (sirens wail) - [Bald Man] What the fuck is goin' on here? - We got burned, Tiny, six of our brothers were gunned down. - Where's the stuff? - I don't know, it's not here. - Where's Blackie? - [Man] Tiny, what the fuck is goin' on here? - Where the fuck were you? You were supposed to be watchin' the stuff! - I went down to Frankie's to have a beer, and I ain't babysittin' those idiots. - Alright, cool. We got a meeting in two hours, everybody is there. Everybody. Let's go. - (sighs) Fuck. - Think we got a little carried away in there or what? - (chuckles) Didn't we? Are you fuckin' stupid, huh? - Fuck! - What the fuck are you doin'? Are you stupid or somethin'? - What the fuck did I do? Chill out, man, come on, relax, man. - You gotta be the stupidest person I ever fuckin' met. Speedy. - Yeah? - Today. Get the fuck outta here. - Serge, can I get a strawberry shake? - Got it. - Thanks. - You, uh, should try the chocolate. - Excuse me? - No, the chocolate shakes are, they're great. - Have we met? - Yeah, remember, at the club tonight? - Oh, yeah, the talent agent. - Yeah. - Thanks, Serge. - So, uh, you mind if I join you? - Kinda looks like you already have. - I couldn't help noticing how, well, how down you looked. I mean, what could a beautiful girl like you be depressed about? - Oh, god. You're one of those types. - One of those? - Yeah, one of those Hollywood types that only cares about what a girl looks like. I'm so tired of guys like that in this town. - No, see, you got me all wrong. See, I'm in the talent business, I get paid to be vain. (Stephanie laughs) See, see? You laughed, you look great when you laugh. You should do that more often. - Oh, god, I've gotta go. My partner's supposed to be here to pick me up any minute. - Listen, Stephanie, I want you to come in and read for me. I'm really interested in representing you. - I don't know, it sounds like a pickup line. - Come on, do I look like a conman? - Look, you better take off before my boyfriend gets here. He gets real jealous when he sees me talking to another guy. - I'm not gonna leave, until you promise me you're gonna call. - You don't give up, do you? - Nope, that's why I'm successful. - Yeah, I'll call you. Serge, put it on my tab. (melancholic acoustic guitar music) - Stephanie, come here. - Blackie, come on. - Look, I'm sorry I snapped back there. You know how much I hate you workin' at that place. All those sleazy guys in there. - You know why I've gotta do this! I have to support my sister and I. Blackie, come on, I'm waitressing, I'm not stripping. - I know, I just hate the idea of those guys hitting on you. Come on, that's just how I am, you know that. I love you, baby. - What am I gonna do with you? Huh? Come on. - [Blackie] I got a couple ideas. (chuckles) - Hey, Jess. - Hey, Stephanie. - How was your night, baby? - Pretty good. - Did you take your medicine? - Mm, mm-mm. - Honey, can you get me a beer? - Open your mouth. (Jess chuckles) Open your mouth. - I have food in my mouth. - Alright. Here you go, baby. - Thank you. (sniffs) - Blackie, why do you always have to do that stuff? Especially around my sister, you know how I feel about that. - She's got her medicine, I've got mine. - You know why she takes her medicine. You never started doing that stuff until you started hanging around with your biker friends. - You know, I am in the room. - I noticed. Listen, forget that, listen. I got a deal goin' down with a couple of the other guys. If things go down on this, I'll have enough money, listen, so we can both leave, we can just leave all this fuckin' shit behind. We can just get away. - Yeah, right. - What is her fuckin' problem? - Why can't you just be nice to her? - I was nice. (Stephanie sighs) - She never does anything to you, I'm gonna go check on her. - Honey? Could I have the clicker? (Stephanie sighs) Thank you. - [Rick] Alright, your appointment's at 11AM. Now you go see Rex Harris and he's the casting director. - I got some more submissions for you, Rick. - Great. (sighs) Do I have any phone calls? - No. - Now, you're sure a girl named Stephanie didn't call today? - I was sure at nine o'clock. I was sure again at 10 o'clock. Trust me, Rick, there's no calls. - Are we a little testy today? I mean, did we miss our cup of java this morning? Alright, alright. - There's still five girls out there waitin' to see you, Rick. - Shit. Alright listen, do me a favor. Call Frankie, tell him I'll be late for lunch, thanks. - Alright. (Rick sighs) (Rick sighs) - Hey, sunshine. - Hi, baby! - How's my little girl? - Daddy! - How are ya, baby? - (moans) Good now. - Missed you. - Yeah. - Hey, I need you to do a favor for me. - [Stephanie] Okay, what? - I need you to keep an eye on this bag. Put it somewhere safe. - What's in it? Let me see what's in it! - No, trust me. It's better if you don't know. Just think of it as our future. (suspenseful music) (heavy knocks) (heavy knocks) Hold on! (thud) (groans) - Where the fuck have you been? And where is the share of the goods? - What the fuck is goin' on? - It's just a friendly reminder of what you get when you fuck with me, motherfucker. - Where the fuck's the stuff, man? - Hey, nobody's fuckin' with anybody! I got the stuff, it's safe. - Oh, it's safe, good. That's good, that's good, because you know what? Me and Speed were thinkin' that maybe you were thinkin' of maybe makin' this more kinda like a one-way split? (Blackie laughs) - Man, I think he's fuckin' holdin' out on us. Where the fuck's the stuff? - Hey, hey, hey, easy! We're all friends here! - [Speed] I say we fuckin' waste him, right fuckin' now! - Listen, listen, listen. - Come on! - He's the only one who knows where the stuff is, okay? Alright? So I'll tell you what's gonna happen. I'll tell you what's gonna happen, we are gonna go... (Blackie laughs) Right now. And we're gonna go get the stuff, or else Speed is going to blast your brains from Tokyo to Timbuktu. (Blackie chuckles) - I gotta make a phone call. - Let's make your fuckin' call. - Don't fuckin' try anything, man, I'll fuckin' pop you! Come on, man, I ain't got all fuckin' day. Come on, hurry the fuck up! - I'm fuckin' dialin', alright? Ah, fuck. - What? - It's busy. (thuds) (Speed groans) Ah, I don't think so. You little fuck head. (gun fires) (chuckles) (suspenseful music) Now what the fuck are you gonna do, huh, bitch? Come here. No, no, no, no, come here, bitch. Come on, come here. You know what? You fuckin' look like a bitch. Maybe I'll just make you bitch, huh? (gun clicks) Fuck. (grunts) (thuds) (tires screech) (tires screech) (tires screech) (tires screech) (tires screech) (tires screech) (tires screech) (explosion booms) (glass smashes) (biker screams) (flames roar) (laughs) Fuck these bitches. - So, what's your problem? - I don't have any problem. I just like to see some new talent around here. - Yeah, is that what you'd like? - Yeah. - Then why don't you do yourself a favor? Go find another fuckin' club to jerk off in. Get the fuck outta here. - Come on, Frankie! - Come on, take it easy, take it easy. - I'm alright, what took you so long? I thought you were gonna stand me up. - No, that only happens to me with gorgeous women. - You know, what is matter with you? Are you workin' too hard? Do you need a vacation, is that the problem? - Well, it gets kind of frustrating looking at beautiful women all day that you can't have. - What are you, a girl or somethin'? You sound desperate, I mean, play the field a little. what is the matter with you already? - Look, I'm not like you, alright? Maybe I wanna find one girl, you know, have a family, you know, have a kid, you know? - Family? - Yeah. - There's my family. (speaks Italian) - Listen, listen. I wanna ask you about that girl last night, Stephanie. - Yeah. - Well, there's just somethin' about her. - Yeah, the g-string goin' up her ass. - No, it's not the g-string goin' up her butt. It's just somethin' about her that intrigued me. - Look at me. Look at me! - What am I doin'? I'm lookin' at you. - You don't need this girl, you got that? This girl has problems, okay? Forget her. - Yeah, so what, we all got problems. - Oh, no, she's got a boyfriend. - Yeah, but she didn't look too happy last night. Maybe she's not gettin' along with her boyfriend. - You don't understand, her boyfriend is in this, uh, this motorcycle gang, the Satan Slaves, you know? You wanna wake up one day with a stick of dynamite in your ear? You don't need that, forget her! You always gotta pick the impossible ones. - Well, that's my luck. - Look at this. Sweetheart, come with me, come with me. Come here, yeah, go get married, that's smart. (phone keypad bleeps) - Hi, honey. - Hi, baby. What're you doin' here? - Who was that? - Nobody, it was the wrong number. - I just came by to see you, how are ya? - I'm good, (laughs) how are you? - Real good. (chuckles) - What'd you do today? - Oh, I was just playin' with a couple of the guys. - Mm, as usual. - Nothing much. And then I thought I'd come by and see my girl. - Baby, what is wrong with you? Stop it, come on! - I missed you, that's all. - Jessica's in the other room, she's sleeping. - Yeah? Tell her to come out. (chuckles) - That's not funny. - I'm kidding. Oh, come on, just... - No. - Come on. - (chuckles) Stop. Sit back, I'll get you a beer. - Party pooper. (sighs) Hey, grab me an ashtray too, will ya? Oh, man. - Here you go. (Blackie chuckles) Not funny. (Blackie coughs) Again. - Hey, just checkin'. Who the fuck is this? (Stephanie gasps) - Blackie, come on, stop it. - What is this? - Let go, let go of my hair. - Rick Hansen, talent agent? - [Stephanie] It's not what you think it is. - Oh, no? What's he gonna make you, a big fuckin' star, huh, huh? Are you fuckin' this guy? - Blackie, come on, stop it. - Are you fuckin' this guy? - No, give me a break! I'm not... - Did you call him? (Stephanie screams) Did you call him, huh? - Blackie, come on. - Was that who you were callin' on the fuckin' phone? - No! - If I find out you are fuckin' this guy, I swear to god... - Stop it! (Stephanie chokes and groans) - Shut up. - Leave my sister alone, stop doing that! Leave her alone. - I'm sick of your fuckin' mouth, you know that? - [Stephanie] Jessica, leave her alone! Jess, Jess, Jessica! (coughs) - I don't need any of this shit. - Jessica! It's okay, it's okay. Good. There you go, there you go. It's okay, baby, I'm right here. Here you go, baby. - Thanks. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I mean, look what he's done to your face. I mean, look at what he's done to both of us for that matter. - Jessica. I wanna tell you something right now, okay? This is never gonna happen again, it's over between us. I promise. - Well, I just hope that you mean it this time. Because, I would never want anything to happen to you. (melancholic acoustic guitar music) - Are you ready to order yet, sir? - Actually, I'm waiting for somebody. They should be here any minute. - Well, I can let you wait at the table for another minute but then I'm gonna have to please ask you to wait in the bar. - Oh, there she is right now. Why don't you give us a few minutes, alright? Hey. - Hi. - You made it. For a minute there, I thought you were gonna stand me up. - I just ran into some traffic, that's all. - What's with the shades? - Oh, (chuckles) I just had a little accident. - What happened? - (sighs) Nothing. (sighs) - Oh, my god. He did this to you. (Stephanie sobs) No, hey, hey, listen. It's okay. - I've gotta get away from this guy, he's gonna kill me. - Just calm down, alright, just calm down. I'm gonna help you with this. - You will? - Yeah, I will. You just gotta stay away from this guy for a while. I have a little place down on the beach. You could stay there for a couple of days till this whole thing blows over. - Rick, I can't, you don't understand, I can't miss work. - That's the first place he's gonna look for you. - I need the money. - I can loan you some money. Just until you get back on your feet. - Why are you doing this? You don't even know me. - I just see somethin' in you. (sighs) I wanna help you. I know it sounds crazy, but, but the first time I laid eyes on you... I had this... I just had this feeling about you. (heavy rock music) - Marty, take the bikes out, run around the neighborhood a few times, see if somethin' comes up. - Hey, it's all good, bro. Put the word out on the street. We're gonna nail these cock suckers. - Slim was onto somethin' before he got snuffed out. He was involved somehow, I just know that. I don't get it, who would have the balls to do this to us? Had to be someone who knew the deal was goin' down. - Shit, that could be anybody. - Even one of our own brothers. (Blackie chuckles) - You're funny, man. - Hey. - Hey, Blackie, what's up? - Where the hell have you been? - Been down in the Playpen, have a few laughs with Frankie. Hey, beat it. - Look, I got an informant workin' on some information out on the streets for me. - Yeah? - He's gonna have a couple names for me real soon. - Anything yet? - I want you to get ready for a war. (Blackie chuckles) - You know I'm down with that. I wanna get those cock suckers just as bad as you do. You want a drink? - Nah. - Whisky! Let me know. - It's gettin' way outta hand, bro. I didn't know you were gonna blow people away. - It's a little fuckin' late for that now, isn't it? - I think he knows, Blackie. (chuckles) - Fuck Tiny, I'll take care of Tiny. You just stay outta his fuckin' way. - If he finds out, man, he's gonna fuckin' kill us. - Shut up. Let's get outta here, have more of coke. Don't go soft on me, Spider. - So, we got a deal or what? - I don't know, do we? How much of that shit you say you got? - I told you, man, I got 30 keys. - Give you 200,000. - Don't you mean at least 300,000? - 200,000, you forgot you owe me 50k. - So what happened to the other 50k? - That's the interest. - So wait a second, you're gonna charge me 100% interest because I'm a couple of weeks late, what kinda shit is that? - You're playin' my game, I'm makin' the fuckin' rules. What do I look like, the fuckin' Bank of America? - I thought we were cool, man. - See, that's your problem, Spider, you got shit twisted. We ain't fuckin' cool, we're just associates. Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna sell me this god damn dope for 200 thou, or you're gonna bring me 100 thou of my money in fucking cash, Friday, or shit's gonna get real fucked up for you, Spider. It's gonna be real fucked up. (phone keypad bleeps) (phone rings) - Hey, Tiny. Yeah, it's Spider. I think I know who ripped us off, man. - What you doin'? - We're goin' away for a couple of days Jess, go pack a bag. - I don't wanna go. - Jess, we're just gonna get away for a little while, okay? I'm serious, go pack a bag, this is the only way I'm gonna be able to break away from him. - No, you need to get away. You need to do something for yourself. (distant engine revs) Is that him? - Yeah, that's him. - Oh! - Stop it, go pack a bag, I'm serious. - I'm not going, I'm a big girl, I can take care of myself. - Jessica, I don't feel comfortable leaving you here alone. What if he comes back here looking for me? - Well, then I'll tell him that you're not here, and if he tries to get in, I'll call the police. Go and have a good time, please. - Jess, come on! - I can take care of myself. Go and have a good time. You go get him. (Stephanie sighs) Go get him, I'll take your bags out. - Hey. - Hi. Mm, I want you to meet somebody. - Hi. - Hey. - Jessica, this is Rick. Rick, Jessica. - Hi. - Pleasure, I'll put these in the trunk, alright? - Okay. - It was nice meetin' ya. - You too. He's cute. (Stephanie giggles) - Are you sure you're gonna be alright? - I'm gonna be fine, you have fun. - [Stephanie] Okay. Mm, bye. - I'm happy for you. (engine revs) - How's business, Ringman? - Tiny, long time no see. - You takin' a little trip? - I'm just handlin' my business. - You don't mind if I take a peek inside your car now, would you? - What the fuck are you talkin' about? Hell no, you can't look in my car. - Oh, I'm sorry, maybe you haven't heard. We got ripped off recently, six of the brothers are dead. - Well, I'm really sorry about that, but I don't know shit about it, what're you tryin' to say, I had somethin' to do with it? - Got a tip. - Fuck your tip. Tiny, how long have you known me, man, what, 15, 20 years? What is this shit? These motherfuckers. You know what? You're a fuckin' pussy and you always been a pussy, man. Wearin' a jacket and rollin' with a bunch of tough guys, that don't make you tough, this makes you tough, and you ain't tough. Fuckin' Spider, you ain't shit, you set me up! - Shut your hole, Ring, but answer a few questions! - I ain't gotta answer shit to you, I ain't afraid of you or none of these punk motherfuckers, and you know that. (guns fire) (guns click) (gun fires) (guns fire) (dark atmospheric tones) - Give me the bag. Damn it! We got the wrong guy. - [Rick] How did you end up with Blackie anyways? - Well, when my sister and I first moved out here from Phoenix, god, I got hit on by every con artist, shark and scumbag imaginable. - That doesn't surprise me, you're a beautiful girl. - Yeah, well, I got sick of it. Then I met Blackie. He was so different. Genuine, if you can believe that. And then he hooked up with his motorcycle friends, started doing drugs and drinking. Just hasn't been the same since then. - You know, I like your sister, she's real nice. - Thanks. I love her so much. I'm a little worried though, leaving her home alone. - Ah, she'll be fine, we'll call her from the beach house. (melancholic acoustic guitar music) - My mom, we don't talk about her much. - No? - She left when I was five. But my dad has always been very supportive and there for us. My sister has epilepsy. - Sorry to hear about that. - You see, I'm all she's got out here, so I've been taking care of her ever since we moved to LA. - Quit it! - Turn. - Quit it, no! - Wanna get your hands off the girl? - What's your problem? - Blackie, you know me, I don't like anybody comin' in here and messin' with my girls. - I wasn't messin' with her. - Am I talkin' to you? - Excuse me? - Ah, relax, Johnny. - Where's Stephanie? - She didn't come in tonight. - Where the fuck is she? - I think it's time you guys go. - Come on. I'll be back. Tell Stephanie to call me. - Yeah, I'll write it down, it's a priority. - You live here? - Yeah, why, are you surprised? - No. It's just, I've never knew anybody who lived in a place like this. - Well, people do, you know, it's a nice place, it's home. Come on. (heavy metal music) ♪ Yeah, I penetrate the demons ♪ Their teardrops burn away - Look at what we got here.

I've gotta go get my stuff, but you've gotta help me up. - Oh yeah, this couch is a little awkward. - Two, three! - There you go. - Thanks. (Rick sighs) - Well, uh... Here you go. (Stephanie chuckles) Listen, if you need anything, I'll just, well, be downstairs, alright? You get some sleep, okay? - Okay. (melancholic acoustic guitar music) (hairdryer blows) (suspenseful music) - I can't believe it, it's not here! Fuck! - Check the other fuckin' room. (Jess yelps) - What are you doing here? - None of your fuckin' business. Where's Stephanie? - I don't know where Stephanie is, Blackie. - You have no fuckin' idea where she is? - Well, maybe she's at work. - (chuckles) She's at work, huh? You know, funny thing is, I went by there last night, and they said she never came in, and I know she's not there tonight. So where the fuck is she? - I don't know. - You know, I hate it when people lie to me. Spider. She lied to me. (glass smashes) (Jess groans) (Jess groans) (melancholic music) (Spider grunts) How's your memory now? Let's take her with us. (Jess groans) - What's the matter? - I've gotta call my sister. - Why, did she page you? - No, I've just got a really bad feeling. - Alright. (phone rings) - Jessica? - It's so nice of you to call. - Oh, my god. (suspenseful music) - Now, I want you to listen, and listen close. You know what I want, I want the bag. I want you to go to the Playpen and I'll call you there. - What? - You heard me. If you ever wanna see your sister again, I suggest you be there. Oh, and by the way, Stephanie, I'm lookin' forward to meeting your friend. - Oh, my god. - What, what, what's goin' on? - We've gotta get back to the apartment. - Wait, don't panic, don't panic, alright? - Rick, you don't understand. That was Blackie, he's got my sister. We've gotta get back to the apartment right now. Jessica, Jessica! Oh, god. Oh, my god, Rick. Oh, no. - Look, uh, let's not jump to conclusions here, alright? - The bag. - What bag? - The bag that Blackie gave me. It's not there. Jessica must've given it to me when she loaded the luggage! That's Blackie's bag. Oh, my god. - There must be about $200,000 in here and a lot of coke. What are you doin' with it? - Blackie gave it to me to hold onto. He told me not to look at it. Rick, he's got Jessica, do you know what he could do to... - Listen, he's not gonna do anything to Jessica, I promise. We'll handle this, alright? We'll handle it. - Okay. - Come on. We don't have a lot of time. (moody rock music) - [Blackie] So, you saw Rick the other night, huh? - [Spider] Yeah, he threw a party up at the clubhouse. - Who was there? - A pretty good crowd. A lot of girls, you know? A lot of really, just good-lookin' chicks. - The same hookers or... - The same fuckin' hookers. - [Blackie] Any new ones? - [Spider] Well, that girl Enga got like a new tit job. It was awesome. - Shut up. - They were bigger. - She was big already! - [Spider] I know, and now they're like double-Ds. - [Blackie] Christ, Jesus. - [Spider] Was like a little ass in her bra. (Blackie laughs) - [Blackie] You're funny, man. Alright, come on, grab her. - [Spider] Come on. Come on! - [Blackie] I think you'll kind of like it. It's a little homey. - [Spider] Get in. - Get in there! (Jess yelps) Well, make yourself comfortable. - Give me your fuckin' hands. Give me 'em! - You know, Spider. I got feelin' Stephanie's got herself a new boyfriend. - Oh, yeah? - I'm really looking forward to meeting him. - I bet you are. - [Blackie] She looks kinda good like that, huh, Spider? - Yeah, she does. She looks real good. (Blackie chuckles) - [Blackie] I think he likes you. - Frankie, what the hell happened? - I don't know. One of my dancers did one lap dance too many. What do you think happened? Her boyfriend came in here with his gang and went berserk, okay? Didn't I tell you not to get involved with them, or her? - No, Frankie... - Shut your fuckin' mouth, do you hear me? Shut your fuckin' mouth! - Can we stop pointin' fingers here? We got a bigger problem. We think Blackie's kidnapped her sister. - Oh, that's it, I'm callin' the cops. - No, listen, Frankie, I don't think that's a good idea. - Oh, you don't? - No. - Her boyfriend comes in, wrecks the club, kidnaps her sister, but you don't think it's a good idea. You are a stupid son of a bitch. - Look, we're gonna put her sister's life in danger. Besides, I think I know what he wants. - Spider, go outside. - Why? - 'Cause I don't wanna be surprised by any campers, alright? Relax. You know, Jessica, I think you're holding out on me. I think you know where Stephanie is and I think you know who she's with. - I don't know where Stephanie is, Blackie. Just leave me alone. - You know, uh, Spider, he kinda likes you. If I was to go outside and tell him that, well, you kinda like him. - [Jess] Fuck you. - I think he'd like that. - Fuck you. - Let me ask you again. Where's Stephanie, and who is she with? How fond are you of keeping this ear? Because if you don't tell me what I wanna hear, I'm gonna rip it off your fuckin' head. - She's with some guy. - What guy? - I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't. I don't. (Blackie sighs) - Were you listening? - No. - I'm gonna call the Playpen. - Alright. - Keep a fuckin' eye on her. - Okay. - And don't touch her. - I'm not gonna! (phone rings) (suspenseful music) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hello. - [Blackie] Hey, sunshine. Guess who. - Yeah. I've got it. What do you want me to do? (sighs) That was Blackie. - This thing just keeps gettin' worse every minute. - Look I'm sure he wants to trade Jessica for his briefcase. - You don't get it, do you? You guys are in over your heads, we gotta call the cops. - No! - We can't take that chance, Frankie. Besides, I think if we give him the stuff back, he'll let go of Jessica. - You think. And what if he doesn't, huh? These guys are not humans, these guys are animals. These guys will kill you. - I've gotta use the restroom. - Well, what do you want me to do, huh? - I'm tellin' you somethin'. They will kill all of us. Do you understand that? This is no joke. - Point of no return. - Mm, mm, mm. Rise and shine, baby. So, uh, Blackie says you kinda dig me, huh. - Yeah, right. - Yeah. I gotta admit, you're not bad lookin'. Why don't we kill a little time, huh, what do you say? - Get off of me! (grunts) (yelps) - Come on. Come on, baby. (Jess yelps) Alright. Alright, fine, you wanna do it the hard way? (glass smashes) (Spider groans) God damn it! Fuck! - What the fuck is goin' on? - She got away! - Well, go fuckin' get her! What the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus fuckin' Christ! She went that way. Motherfucker. - I'm gonna go down and see Blackie and handle this myself. - Are you outta your mind? This guy's gonna cut us up into little pieces. What's the matter with you? - Alright, alright, I'm gonna go check on Stephanie. - Yeah, you check on her. - She's cute, ain't she? - Yeah, adorable, go ahead. I hate this. This is my life. - Hey, Frankie, she's gone. - Ah, fuck, come on! (suspenseful music) (engine revs) - Got ya. What do you wanna do with her? - Take her back to the shack. - Come on. Come on! - God. (sighs) (punk rock music) - Long time no see, little girl. Where's your old man? - [Stephanie] I know who ripped you guys off. - What the fuck you talkin' about? - [Stephanie] Does this look familiar? (gasps) - You got two minutes to tell me where you got this stuff. (phone keypad bleeps) - Aw, geez. Promise me you'll never do that again, okay? Promise me that. - I talked to him, he wants to see me alone. - You're not gonna see him by yourself. - He said he'll let my sister go. He just wants his stuff back. - When? - Tonight, 3AM. - Where? - Point Doom. - I'm goin' with you, it's too dangerous. - He's not gonna hurt me, at least, I don't think he will. - Yeah, but Stephanie, you don't know that. - Rick, let me do this alone. I've got you too involved in this already. I don't have a choice. - No. You see, I wanna be involved. I am involved. Remember that time I said to you there was something different about you, huh? (Stephanie chuckles) I don't wanna lose you, ever. Let's, let's do this together, okay? Okay? - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Get her in there, will you? - Sit down, damn it! Don't move. - [Jess] Oh, god. What's that? - [Spider] Oh, you're gonna like it. Stop it or I'll break your fuckin' neck. Yeah, you're gonna feel real good now. - No, no. (Spider chuckles) No, no. No, Blackie, no. - Hold her. - Oh, god. (grunts) - There's a good one right there. (Jess groans and sobs) You know, I hate doin' this because, I really don't know how much to give. So, I'll just guess. (chuckles) Does it feel good? (dark atmospheric tones) (men laugh) - Jessica. (Blackie laughs) Hey. Jessica. - [Blackie] Look at her fuckin' eyes. (laughs) - Jessica. (Blackie laughs) Jessica. (Blackie laughs) Jessica. - Hey, Jess. (chuckles) - [Spider] Hey, Jessica. Jessica. (Blackie laughs) Jessica. (Blackie laughs) (Blackie coughs and laughs) (men laugh) Jessica, come on, girl. (Blackie laughs) (Stephanie sighs) - Do you actually think that's a good idea? - Look, we gotta have some sort of backup, alright? This guy Blackie is not gonna show up unarmed. - Rick, the last thing I wanna do is get into a shooting match with him. - Look, you're the one who didn't wanna call the police. Alright? Blackie's already killed six of his own gang members. He's not gonna think twice about killin' us. - I guess I just knew him different, that's all. - Yeah. - Rick? - Yeah. - There's something I need to tell you. If anything should happen to me tonight, I mean, if anything bad should hap... - Look, this guy Blackie is about as low as they come. And I guarantee you, he's not gonna make it out in the end. He's not. (Stephanie sighs) - What time is it? - It's, uh, it's midnight. (Stephanie sighs) Look, why don't you go get some sleep, alright? Go upstairs and rest a little bit. I'll stay down here and I'll set the alarm, okay? (dark atmospheric tones) (suspenseful music) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Hey, Frankie, are you ready? Alright, I'll meet you out front. There she is. I gotta go down there. They said, uh, they said no guns. (Frankie sighs) Frankie? You gotta back me up on this one. Frankie. - [Frankie] I got you. - Alright. (dark atmospheric music) (steel scrapes) (Stephanie gasps) (suspenseful music) - [Stephanie] Damn it! (engine revs) (Frankie groans) - Hey, hey, hey. (Jess moans) - Well, if it isn't Stephanie's knight in shining armor. - I don't want any trouble with you, alright? I brought what you wanted. - Where's Stephanie? - Let's leave Stephanie out of this. You and I can handle this by ourselves no problem. - Did you honestly think that you were gonna fuck my woman and get away with it? Huh? - Look, I brought what you wanted, alright? I mean, you got what you wanted. - I call the shots here. (Jess yelps) Rick, meet Spider. Spider, this is Rick. (suspenseful music) (thud) Get the bag. - [Spider] It's all here, baby, let's move. - Come on, bitch, get the fuck up, just get the fuck up. Come on! - Come on, man, let's go. - [Blackie] We're takin' her with us. - What the fuck do we need her for? - I need her to get to Stephanie! - Are you outta your fuckin' mind? - Yeah, I'm outta my fuckin' mind. - We got what we came for, man, you wanna stay here all night and play with these fuckin' chicks, go ahead. I'm takin' off. (gun fires) (Jess yelps) - [Blackie] One down, one to go. - No, no! (gun fires) - So you decided to come? - Jessica, run! Run! Don't you move, you piece of shit! - You're gonna shoot me? - I swear to god, Blackie, don't, don't make me do this! - Stephanie, are you gonna shoot me? - [Stephanie] Blackie don't come any closer, I swear to god! I swear to god! - Go ahead. Put me out of my fuckin' misery. Go ahead, do it! (Stephanie sobs) I did this for you. I did all of this for you, so we could get away. This is for us. Calm down, stop, stop. I love you, Stephanie, I love you, Stephanie. Tell me you love me, come on, tell me you love me. Tell me, tell me... - No, I can't. - Listen to me. - Please, stop it. Don't do this. (dark atmospheric music) - Okay, we can do this the fuckin' hard way. (groans) (thuds) (groans and grunts) - No! - You wanna fuck with me? (thuds) (groans) Huh, you wanna? (thuds) (groans) (thuds) (groans) (thud) (groans) You think you can fuck my woman? (thud) (groans) Motherfucker. - [Stephanie] Leave him alone, please! (thuds) (groans) (gun fires) (sobs) (somber orchestral music) (sobs) - It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. (Stephanie sobs) Shh, shh, shh, shh. (Stephanie sobs) - Let's go now, baby, come on. Come on, it's okay. - [Frankie] (groans) My head. - [Rick] Shit. (Frankie groans) - My fuckin' head. (groans) My fuckin' head. My fuckin' head. My fuckin' head. (engine revs) (Stephanie screams) (intense music) - Come on, come on, get outta the fuckin' car! You goin' somewhere? Get outta the fuckin' car. You shoot me, motherfucker? Stop the car, motherfucker, stop the car! (tires screech) (groans) (tires screech) (tires screech) (somber orchestral music) (tires screech) (waves crash) (motorcycle approaches) (groans) - I wouldn't have believed it, if I didn't see it with my own eyes. You robbed and murdered your own brothers. And for what? Drugs? Money? The Satan Slaves is a brotherhood, you fucking asshole! - You know what, Tiny? I've had a pretty fucked up day. It doesn't have to end that way. There's enough here, we could split it, huh? Walk away. - So I should just forget about what you've done, huh? - At this point, I couldn't really give a flying fuck. It's your move, bro. (laughs) (spits) (tense atmospheric tones) (gun fires) (guns fire) (waves crash) - Hey, Frankie. What you doin'? - What do mean, what am I doin'? - Why didn't you go home and change? - What's there to change? Our whole lives changed, we killed like half a dozen people, my club's in friggin', I gotta worry about my wardrobe? Hey, Jessica, how you doin'? - I'm okay. - Yeah, you hungry? - Yeah. - I'll buy you some bread, you like eggs? Yeah? You come with me, she'll be with me, alright? - Okay. - Everything will be good. - Alright. - I'll buy her an omelet or somethin'. - I think he's got a few issues or somethin' to deal with. I still can't have a normal conversation with that guy. Come here. I'm so glad you came into my life. I'm so glad.
