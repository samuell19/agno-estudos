She got me really pissed. I mean, for her, it was just a one-nighter. Like she just wanted to screw me. So, I think I got a little bit angry, and I lost control. SO YOU BEAT HER UP? THAT WAS A MISTAKE. BUT YOU SOUND LIKE A NICE GUY. IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, RIGHT? No, I didn't beat her. It actually went a little further than that. I kind of hurt her bad. HOW BAD?

OH, IT'S AMAZING. IN THE 20 YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN BETTER DEMOS DELIVERED FASTER. EVERYBODY IN THIS TOWN WITH A RADIO WAS LISTENING LAST NIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS, BOYS. I'M GOING TO CALL UP BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HAVE THEM STRIKE UP YOUR NEW CONTRACTS RIGHT NOW. HARRIS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT ON THAT. WHAT? WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE BUMP IN THE OLD ROAD. TELL HIM, JON. HARRIS, I WANT MY OWN SHOW. WHAT? AND WE'RE NOT TALKING GRAVEYARD SHIFT, EITHER. I WANT HIM AS LEAD-IN TO MY SHOW, PLUS I WANT HIM WITH ME FOR AN HOUR. YOU MEAN BUMPING DeSANTOS? NO BIG LOSS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I'M PAYING DeSANTOS? $245,000. DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO FLUSH THAT MONEY DOWN THE TOILET? WE'RE GETTING OFFERS, HARRIS -- BIG OFFERS. KROV, KHOK, UNITED SYNDICATION. THIS IS NOT AN OPTION, HARRIS. THIS A DEAL-BREAKER. YOU TWO ARE LITTLE SHITS. YEAH. BUT AT LEAST WE'RE STILL YOUR LITTLE SHITS. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S US. AND TOMORROW THERE WILL BE 15 MORE OF THOSE AROUND THE CITY. YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD. PRETTY GOOD? TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING TO BE SIGNING A CONTRACT FOR YOUR OWN SHOW, MAKING 10 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU HAVE EVER MADE, AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT'S PRETTY GOOD? YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S GREAT. IT'S... IT'S FANTASTIC. DID I KEEP MY PROMISE TO YOU? DID I GET YOU THERE? YOU DID, BUT WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT MY STAYING ON YOUR SHOW FOR AN HOUR? I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO BE ON MY OWN. JON, I NEED YOU ON MY SHOW JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. I THINK I'M MISSING SOMETHING HERE, LIKE A LITTLE GRATITUDE. LOOK, I WANT TO RIDE THIS BABY JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND MAKE SURE THE SHOW'S IN A SOLID POSITION. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? ALL RIGHT. THEN I'M ON MY OWN? YES, JON. ALL RIGHT, THEN. YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S US. SHARON, ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL? HAVE YOU COMPLETELY LOST YOUR MIND? WHAT THE HELL'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN YOUR FIRST PAYCHECK. COULD YOU SPEND WHAT LITTLE MONEY WE HAVE IN A STUPIDER WAY? I DON'T NEED THIS. JON, WAIT. CYNTHIA... JON PRICE. YEAH, I WAS WONDERING ABOUT YOU, TOO. I WAS JUST DRIVING AROUND AND THINKING ABOUT THAT OFFER TO HAVE SOME WINE AND TALK. WERE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THAT? RIGHT NOW? UH, YEAH...YEAH, SURE. OKAY. WHERE AM I GOING? HI. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M HERE. OH, HI, SHARON. I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE. YOU GOT A CALL-IN FROM CYNTHIA. CYNTHIA? SHE SAYS PICK UP THE JACKET YOU LEFT AT HER PLACE ANYTIME, PREFERABLY AT NIGHT, WHEN YOU CAN TUCK HER IN. SHARON, SHE'S JUST PLAYING WITH YOU. IS SHE THE FIRST, OR HAVE THERE BEEN OTHERS? SHE'S PROBABLY A FAN. I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT, JON? DON'T LIE TO ME, BECAUSE I AM NOT AN IDIOT. I CAN SMELL HER ALL OVER YOU. OKAY, UH... OKAY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS? NO. I'M TOO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING. I'LL HAVE SOMEBODY COME OVER AND GET THE REST OF MY THINGS TOMORROW. OH, OKAY, THAT'S IT? YOU'RE JUST GOING TO PACK UP AND LEAVE ME JUST LIKE THAT? THAT'S RIGHT, I'M PACKING UP, AND I'M LEAVING. LOOK AT YOU. YOU DON'T EVEN DRESS THE SAME ANYMORE. YOU LOOK LIKE HIM. YOU LOOK LIKE KARLIN. IT'S THAT YOU'VE CHANGED. YOU SOLD YOURSELF OUT TO GET WHAT YOU WANTED. MAYBE IT TOOK THIS OTHER WOMAN TO MAKE ME SEE IT. I DON'T KNOW. I'M OUT OF HERE. OKAY, FINE. I'M NOT GOING TO STOP YOU. YOU WANT TO END IT THIS WAY, THEN GO, LEAVE. I DON'T NEED YOU, SHARON! I AM SUCH AN IDIOT. Karlin: Hey, Jon, how's it going? YOU GAVE CYNTHIA MY NUMBER, DIDN'T YOU? You don't sound too happy. THAT'S RIGHT, KARLIN. I DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT. NEITHER DID SHARON. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE STILL SEEING EACH OTHER. YEAH, RIGHT. NOT ANYMORE. You can have any woman you want now. AND BELIEVE ME, THERE'S A MILLION OF THEM. JON PRICE, I'M DETECTIVE WILKINSON. THIS IS DETECTIVE DURRANO. IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? MIND IF WE ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MAN WHO CALLED YOUR SHOW LAST WEEK? THE ONE WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE COMMITTED A HOMICIDE? YOU MIND COMING WITH US? SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG. COFFEE? NO, THANKS. I DON'T BLAME YOU. EVERYBODY THINKS THAT COPS DRINK COFFEE. ME, I LIKE TEA. DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE PIPES AS FAST. YOU WANT SOME TEA? THAT'S FINE. YEAH, I WANT TO TELL YOU, I REALLY LIKE YOUR SHOW, MAN. ME AND MY PARTNER, WE LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME. YOU GUYS DO SOME SICK STUFF. THAT "RATE THE BUTT" SEQUENCE KILLED ME. THANKS. HERE YOU GO. JON... CAN I CALL YOU JON? YEAH, SURE. JON, WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE GUY WHO CALLED UP, THE ONE WHO CLAIMED TO KILL THE WOMAN HE PICKED UP? YOU THINK HE'LL CALL BACK? HE SAID HE WOULD. MAYBE IT WAS JUST A CRANK CALL. THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED. WE KNOW IT WASN'T A CRANK CALL. I ASKED YOU IF YOU THOUGHT HE MIGHT CALL BACK AGAIN. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THERE REALLY WAS A MURDER? YEAH, JON. THE GUY WAS FOR REAL. YOU SEEM SURPRISED. YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE LEGIT. YEAH, IT'S JUST KIND OF A SHOCK TO THINK HE WAS DESCRIBING A REAL MURDER. WE KNOW HE KILLED THIS WOMAN THREE MONTHS AGO. VIVIAN PORTER'S HER NAME. SHE WAS PUSHED OFF A WAREHOUSE FIRE ESCAPE, JUST LIKE THE CALLER DESCRIBED. SEVEN STORIES, STRAIGHT DOWN. OH... GOD. OH, JESUS. WE DON'T HAVE A MOTIVE YET. NOT A STRONG ONE, ANYWAY. WE FIGURE IT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT HE SAID IT WAS -- A ONE-NIGHT STAND GONE BAD. AND NOW HE'S GETTING HIS ROCKS OFF CALLING YOUR SHOW TELLING THE WORLD WHAT HE DID. JON, I'M GOING TO BE DIRECT WITH YOU. WE BROUGHT YOU DOWN HERE TO ASK YOU ONE SIMPLE QUESTION. YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CALLER? LIKE WHO HE IS, FOR EXAMPLE? NO. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, I'M POSITIVE. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE FIGURED. WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO YOUR PARTNER, KARLIN PICKETT. SEE WHAT HE KNOWS. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO MONITOR THE RADIO STATION, YOUR SHOW ESPECIALLY. IF THE CREEP CALLS, WE'D LIKE TO BE THERE. IT ONLY TAKES 10 SECONDS TO TRACE A CALL. FIVE MINUTES TO GET THE BLACK-AND-WHITES THE LOCATION OF THE CALL. SO IF HE CALLS AGAIN, YOU KEEP HIM TALKING, OKAY? OKAY. WE HAVE NOTHING MORE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, JON. OKAY, THANKS. HEY, THIS IS OUR PHONE NUMBER IN CASE YOU WANT TO CALL US ABOUT ANYTHING -- A HUNCH, A LEAD, WHATEVER. OKAY, THANKS. BOY'S IN A HURRY. JON. WHO'S THE GUY THAT'S CALLED THE SHOW? WHO IS HE, KARLIN? HOW COME YOU'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHO HE IS? A COUPLE COPS WE'RE AT MY HOME THIS MORNING. THEY TOLD ME YOUR FRIEND REALLY KILLED A WOMAN. ARE YOU KIDDING? NO, I'M NOT. IT ALL HAPPENED EXACTLY THE WAY HE DESCRIBED IT. YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING, DID YOU? NO, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU FIRST. WE GOT TO TELL THEM WHO THIS GUY IS. NO, WE CAN'T DO THAT. WE HAVE TO. NO, WE DON'T. EDDIE -- EDDIE DIDN'T DO THIS. EDDIE? EDDIE WHAT? HE'S PROBABLY TAKING CREDIT FOR SOMETHING HE SAW ON THE NEWS. I'M GOING TO TELL THE COPS WHAT'S GOING ON, THAT YOU KNOW THE CALLER'S THIS EDDIE GUY. YOU CAN'T. WE GOT THE TOP-RATED SHOW. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT. YOU TELL THEM ABOUT EDDIE, THEY'LL TAKE US OFF THE AIR. SCREW THE SHOW. THIS GUY KILLED A WOMAN. HE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. LET'S SAY BY SOME COINCIDENCE, THEY TIE HIM TO A MURDER. THE COPS WILL MAKE YOU AND ME ACCOMPLICES TO IT. THAT MEANS JAIL TIME FOR BOTH OF US. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH EDDIE. JON... YES, YOU DID. IF YOU WERE TO PHONE THE COPS, I WOULD FUCK YOU OVER ROYALLY. I AM NOT SUFFERING THIS ALONE. I'LL SAY YOU KNEW AS MUCH ABOUT EDDIE AS I DID. YOU WANTED WOMEN, YOU WANTED SUCCESS, WELL... BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, LITTLE BROTHER. IT ISN'T FREE. GOODBYE, HONEY. PLEASANT DREAMS. I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN RIGHT NOW. I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN RIGHT NOW. I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN RIGHT NOW. I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN RIGHT NOW. PAIR OF 2's. I'M OUT. AH, TOO BAD, JON. I GUESS YOU'RE NOT THE CARD PLAYER I AM. YEAH, I GUESS NOT. CLAIRE, WHAT YOU GOT? STRAIGHT, 10 HIGH. STRAIGHT, 10 HIGH! SUSAN, CAN YOU BEAT IT? MNH-MNH. SUSAN'S GOT A...PAIR, BUT WHAT A PAIR, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT BIG BROTHER KARLIN HAS. FOUR OF A KIND -- JACKS. LOOKS LIKE MY HAND. OKAY, SOMETHING HAS GOT TO COME OFF, LADIES. ALL RIGHT. WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR OUR NEXT CRIMINAL TO CALL, LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS HERE. CALLER NUMBER 1, WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST? Man's voice: WELL, ARE THEY WEARING BRAS? YEP, AND NOT MUCH ELSE. WELL, TAKE THEM OFF! Karlin: MM... CALLER NUMBER 2, WHAT DO YOU SAY? Man's voice: JON? KARLIN? YEAH, WHAT'S YOUR SUGGESTION? UH, I'M SORRY, BUT I HAD TO CALL AGAIN. OKAY, WE'RE LISTENING. I GUESS YOU KNOW BY NOW THAT I WASN'T JOKING ABOUT VIVIAN, WAS I? I REALLY PUSHED HER OFF THAT BUILDING. I'VE GOT TO GET THIS STUFF OFF MY CHEST, YOU KNOW? I MET ANOTHER WOMAN LAST NIGHT. I MEAN, I ACTUALLY LIKED HER, YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO HER, BUT SHE STARTED TO LAUGH AT ME WHEN WE DID IT. I'M IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN RIGHT NOW. THIS WOMAN, SHE WENT HOME WITH YOU? YEAH -- NO, NO, I WENT TO HER HOUSE. IS SHE OKAY? NO. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? I KILLED HER... WITH CYANIDE. GET ME THE LOCATION OF 555-7620. OKAY, KEEP TALKING. TELL US MORE ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW HER NAME? YEAH. YEAH, WE'RE HERE. WE GOT AN E.S.U. AND SIX BLACK-AND-WHITES HEADED FOR THE SOURCE OF THE CALL. UM, I'VE SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY. I...I REALLY... I GOT TO GO. Jon: NO, NO, NO, TALK TO US. COME ON, WE'RE LISTENING. I'LL CALL AGAIN. [ DIAL TONE ] DAMN IT. WHAT IS GOING ON? I DON'T KNOW. EDDIE CALLED ON HIS OWN THIS TIME. GET HIM TO STOP, UNDERSTAND? YOU CAN'T BUY P.R. LIKE THIS. I BET WE MAKE IT TO THE NATIONAL NEWS. I CAN'T DO THIS. THIS IS INSANE. WE GOT THE SYNDICATORS BY THE BALLS. IF EDDIE KEEPS CALLING, THEY'LL BE BEGGING US TO DO A NATIONWIDE SHOW. NOW GET WITH THE PROGRAM. Wilkinson: GENTLEMEN. WE GOT AN ADDRESS, BUT IT'S WRONG. LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOT A SCRAMBLER ON THE LINE. AH, WHAT A DRAG. YEAH, HE'S A SMART ONE. CALLED IN TO HEADQUARTERS AND GOT A CONFIRMATION. ABOUT THE CALLER? YEAH. ANOTHER WOMAN WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT. THE CORONER'S MAKING AN AUTOPSY NOW, BUT THE CALLER PROBABLY KILLED HER THE WAY HE DESCRIBED. CYANIDE POISONING THIS TIME. THE STUFF'S EASY ENOUGH TO GET, AND YOU CAN MIX IT WITH ANYTHING. YOU'D NEVER KNOW. EXCEPT THAT IT SMELLS LIKE BURNT ALMONDS. JESUS. THAT'S TWO IN A ROW. LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT YOURSELVES A GENUINE SERIAL KILLER CALLING IN TO YOUR SHOW. WE GOT TO GET DOWNTOWN. YOU READY? YEAH. THANKS, GUYS. Wilkinson: YOU TRIED. WE'LL KEEP MONITORING. THIS GUY'S REALLY KILLING PEOPLE. I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WOULD GO THIS FAR, MAN. YOU'RE IN ON THIS, AREN'T YOU? WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? THIS IS A TOTAL FUCKING SURPRISE TO ME, JON. LOOK, I KNEW EDDIE WAS WHACKED, BUT NEVER LIKE THIS. THIS SCARES ME. I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. EDDIE OWED ME A FAVOR. I SAVED HIS ASS FROM A LOAN SHARK ONCE, BUT I HAD NO IDEA THIS ASSHOLE MIGHT BE KILLING WOMEN. WELL, THAT'S IT. I'M TELLING THE COPS. YOU CAN'T. EDDIE MIGHT KILL US IF HE THINKS WE WENT TO THE COPS. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? LET HIM KEEP KILLING WOMEN? JON... YOU LET ME HANDLE THIS MY OWN WAY, YOU UNDERSTAND? COPS ARE FUCKING IDIOTS. THEY WOULDN'T BE COPS. YOU DON'T TELL THEM NOTHING. NOW, I'LL GO TO EDDIE. I'LL GET HIM TO STOP. YOU LET ME DO IT MY OWN WAY. HEY. TOUGH DAY, HUH? YEAH. IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN. THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY. JESUS, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. HE KILLED HER. THIS BASTARD'S FOLLOWING ME. CAN I SPEAK WITH DETECTIVE WILKINSON, PLEASE? [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] YOU'VE GOT A CALL ON LINE THREE. I CAN'T TAKE IT. HE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT. TAKE A MESSAGE. HE SAID TO TELL YOU EDDIE'S ON THE PHONE. WHICH LINE? THREE. HELLO? I finally get to speak to you in person. Hello? YEAH, I'M HERE. I really liked talking to you on the radio. It made me feel better. I left a little souvenir in your apartment. Remember Cynthia? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? If I were you, I'd go home before the police do. They might get the wrong idea when they find Cynthia's wallet and clothing not so well hidden in your bedroom. [ CLICK ] [ SIREN ] [ HELICOPTER WHIRRING ] SIR, WE JUST BAGGED THIS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK. BETSY, IT'S JON. WHERE'S KARLIN? I GOT TO TALK TO HIM. I don't know. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF HIM. Ah, Christ. THE COPS WERE HERE. THERE'S A WARRANT OUT FOR YOUR ARREST. I don't understand what's going on here, Jon. I'M BEING FRAMED FOR A MURDER. WELL, YOU'RE IN A PILE OF SHIT. THANKS. I KNOW. I'VE GOT TO GO. Wait, hold on, Jon. [ DING DONG ] KARLIN! KARLIN! EDDIE. EDDIE, EDDIE, EDDIE, WHERE ARE YOU? HERE YOU ARE. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] ENGINEERING. Roger. JON, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR YOU. ROGER, I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. SURE, WHATEVER YOU WANT. I WANT YOU TO TAKE AN ADDRESS THAT'S NEAR THE STATION. I want you to meet me at that gas station. I need you to bring a few things. WHAT KIND OF THINGS? EDDIE? EDDIE? JON? KARLIN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I CAME TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH EDDIE. I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. YEAH. I GUESS WE BOTH HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT. IS THAT MY GUN? YEAH. YOU GOT BALLS, JON. I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE. YOU KNOW EDDIE KILLED ANOTHER WOMAN LAST NIGHT? CYNTHIA. THE WOMAN FROM THE NIGHTCLUB THAT WANTED TO GO HOME WITH YOU? YEP. HE PLANTED HER CLOTHING AND HER WALLET IN MY HOUSE. THE POLICE THINK I KILLED HER. THERE'S A WARRANT OUR FOR MY ARREST. EDDIE. GODDAMN IT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE HIM TO THE COPS. YEAH, WE DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS. WHILE WE'RE WAITING, DO YOU WANT A DRINK? SURE. WHAT HAS HE GOT? LET ME LOOK. HE'S GOT SOME BOURBON, OKAY? YEAH. WHATEVER. ALL RIGHT. HERE YOU GO, LITTLE BROTHER. DOES HE HAVE ANY ICE? WHY DON'T YOU GO LOOK? IT'S A WILD PLACE, HUH? HE'S BEEN A SQUATTER HERE EVER SINCE I MET HIM. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE, JON. OH, YEAH? ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE KIND OF PISSED. PLEASE. DRINK OKAY? YEAH. BY THE WAY, THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO CONFESS TO YOU. THAT IS THAT, UH, THERE IS NO EDDIE. I MEAN... I'M EDDIE. SEE, WITH THIS EQUIPMENT HERE, THIS IS A SOUND PROCESSOR AND A SYNTHESIZER. I CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF MY VOICE. I BECAME EDDIE. OH, MY GOD. YEAH. I GOT ALL THE REGULAR SUPPLIES. SEE, HERE'S THE SCRAMBLER, FOR THROWING OFF THE POLICE TRACING DEVICES, AND A DIALING MECHANISM. I PRERECORDED EDDIE'S VOICE ON THIS TAPE MACHINE, AND I SENT IT TO OUR SHOW BY WAY OF THIS AUTOMATIC TIMER. ALL I HAD TO DO WAS STICK TO A SCRIPT. I MADE IT SOUND REAL AUTHENTIC, EVEN FOOLED YOU, LITTLE BROTHER. OH. AH. WHAT'S THE MATTER, JON? I FEEL A LITTLE DIZZY. VIVIAN AND CYNTHIA -- GOD, THEY WERE HOT, ESPECIALLY VIVIAN. I KILLED THEM BOTH, YOU KNOW. [ RETCHING NOISES ] I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL VIVIAN. WE WERE GETTING IT ON ONE NIGHT ON THE RAILING OF THIS FIRE ESCAPE. OH, GOD. SHE WAS SWEET. ANYWAY, WE JUST GOTTEN THROUGH AND SHE STARTS TO MEALY-MOUTH ALL THIS, "I WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN," YOU KNOW, RELATIONSHIP JARGON. I SUPPOSE SHE DIDN'T LIKE MY RESPONSE BECAUSE SHE GOES TO SLAP ME, I STEP BACK, THE BITCH GOES OVER THE SIDE OF THE FIRE ESCAPE AND FALLS SEVEN STORIES TO THE CONCRETE. SMACK. IT FREAKED ME OUT, BUT THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I WOULD USE HER DEATH TO HELP ME. I WOULD INVENT A KILLER WHO WOULD CALL INTO OUR SHOW AND CONFESS TO THE MURDER. IT WAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. WHY CYNTHIA? WHY DID YOU KILL HER? OUR AUDIENCE DEMANDED IT, THAT'S WHY. THEY WANTED A SERIAL KILLER. SO I GAVE THEM ONE. I EVEN GAVE THEM A DEAD WOMAN HE COULD CALL IN AND CLAIM TO HAVE KILLED, BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. [ RETCHING NOISES ] DO YOU KNOW THAT OUR RATINGS WERE AT THEIR HIGHEST AFTER THAT FIRST CALL FROM EDDIE? A 42 SHARE. BUT ONE WEEK LATER THEY WERE FALLING OFF. ALL OUR NUMBERS WERE BAD. SO THE PEOPLE WANTED MORE, MORE DEATH. SO I GAVE IT TO THEM. I GAVE IT TO THEM, AND FRANKLY, JON, KILLING SOMEONE ISN'T AS HARD AS IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A GOOD CAREER MOVE. YOU BASTARD. YOU POISONED ME, TOO, DIDN'T YOU? YEAH. JON, THEY'RE GOING TO FIND YOU HERE DEAD, AND BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE I PLANTED AT YOUR HOUSE -- CYNTHIA'S DRESS AND HER WALLET -- AND BECAUSE OF ALL THIS EQUIPMENT, THEY'RE GOING TO THINK YOU WERE EDDIE. THEY'RE GOING TO THINK YOU KILLED CYNTHIA. NICE AND NEAT, HUH? AND YOU COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE YOU JUST COULDN'T LIVE WITH YOURSELF ANY LONGER. SO CYANIDE POISONING -- VERY SAD, BUT VERY POETIC. VICTIMIZER DIES THE SAME WAY AS ONE OF HIS VICTIMS. THE REAL BEAUTY OF IT IS, COUPLE DAYS AFTER YOU'RE DEAD, I CAN GO BACK AND HAVE THE MOST TALKED ABOUT RADIO SHOW IN THE COUNTRY ALL TO MYSELF. I'LL BECOME A MEDIA KING. EVEN OPRAH WILL WANT TO DO A SPECIAL ON ME. HIS CO-WORKER WAS A HOMICIDAL MANIAC. SO YOU JUST HAVE BEEN USING ME ALL THE TIME. OH, YEAH. I HAD IT FIGURED OUT MONTHS AGO AND YOU WERE JUST THE RIGHT SUCKER AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. I'M SORRY, JON, BUT I TOLD YOU I HAD BIG PLANS, AND NONE OF THEM INCLUDED YOU. YOU ARE SUCH A BASTARD, KARLIN. YOU MANIPULATED ME INTO DOING ONE SICK THING AFTER ANOTHER UNTIL MY LIFE WAS A WRECK. YOU DIDN'T DRINK YOUR BOURBON. I DIDN'T DRINK THE BOURBON, KARLIN. I SMELLED CYANIDE IN THE BOURBON. COPS TOLD ME CYANIDE SMELLS LIKE BURNT ALMONDS. SO I SWITCHED THE BOURBON FOR SOME COLA AND WATER IN THE KITCHEN. EVEN YOU WERE FOOLED, LITTLE BROTHER. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? YOU GOING TO SHOOT ME? YOU SHOULD HAVE SHOT ME, JON. YOU'RE IN SOME VERY DEEP SHIT NOW. NO, I'M NOT. NO ONE CAN TIE ME INTO ANY OF THIS. OH, YEAH? I'M WIRED, KARLIN. I'M WIRED, YOU SON OF A BITCH. THIS PHONE IS BEING PIPED INTO THE STATION, AND THEY'RE USING THEIR 55,000 WATTS OF POWER TO SPREAD IT TO EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF TOWN. THE WHOLE CITY'S BEEN LISTENING TO YOU. EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME IS GOING OUT ON POWER 98. THAT'S RIGHT, KARLIN. AREN'T YOU THE ONE THAT SAID THERE'S A WHOLE CITY OF PERVERSION OUT THERE FULL OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AFRAID TO TAP INTO THE DARK SIDE OF THEMSELVES? OR MAYBE YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOURSELF. HEY, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS STUFF? TELL ME SOMETHING, KARLIN. HOW DOES IT FEEL KNOWING YOU JUST EXPOSED YOURSELF TO A MILLION PEOPLE? JESUS. THEY HAVE GUNS? QUIET. CONFESSING IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL, ISN'T IT, KARLIN? AND JUST THINK WHAT OUR NUMBERS WILL BE LIKE TOMORROW. Detective: OPEN UP. POLICE! Detective #2: THE POLICE! OPEN UP. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE IS LISTENING TO THE RADIO TONIGHT. Detective: WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! JON... DON'T SHOOT ME. Detective: OPEN UP, KARLIN! IT'S MY PLEASURE TO FUCK YOU OVER. DON'T MOVE! Detective #2: PUT IT DOWN. FREEZE! PUT THE GUN DOWN, KARLIN. Jon: OW. AH. OH, JESUS. GUN. WHOA. WHOA. Paramedic: WATCH YOUR BACKS. WE'RE COMING THROUGH HERE. Man #2: WE RAN IN THE SECOND WE HEARD YOU GUYS ON THE AIR. YOU DID GOOD, KID, BUT THANK GOD WE WERE FOLLOWING KARLIN. IT KEPT US NEARBY. SO I THINK HARRISON FORD OUGHT TO PLAY YOU IN THE MOVIE VERSION OF ALL THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH. GET HIM OUT OF HERE. Woman: MORE COFFEE? SO YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO SHARON YET? NOPE. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT GOING OVER TO HER PLACE, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'D REACT. MAYBE IF YOU APOLOGIZE... GROVEL. IF YOU GET ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AND BEG FOR HER FORGIVENESS LIKE A DOG, MAYBE SHE'LL COME AROUND. I MEAN, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE? YEAH. NO, NO. IT'S ON ME. YOU EARNED IT. HEY, THANKS. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME ANYMORE WITHOUT YOU AT THE STATION. YEAH. WELL, THANKS, ROGER, BUT I THINK I NEED A BREAK FROM RADIO FOR A WHILE. YEAH. DON'T BLAME YOU. HEY, GOOD LUCK. TAKE IT EASY. HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW'S YOUR HAND? DOCTOR SAYS IT'LL BE FINE IN A COUPLE WEEKS. SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? GOOD. I HAVE CALLS TO MAKE. SHARON, LOOK. I'M SORRY. I KNOW WHAT I DID WAS WRONG, YOU KNOW, AND... IT WAS LIKE I WAS POSSESSED. NO ONE FORCED YOU TO DO ANYTHING. YEAH, I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT, SHARON. YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU KNOW, NO ONE FORCED ME. I WANTED ALL THE WRONG THINGS -- THINGS THAT IN THE END DIDN'T WIND UP MEANING ANYTHING. YOU DO. THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY FOR ME. YEAH, I KNOW. I CAN'T PROMISE YOU ANYTHING. WE'LL TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME, OKAY? ONE DAY AT A TIME. WANT TO GRAB A BITE? YEAH. HI, LOS ANGELES, IT'S ME, CHUCK GELSON, ON THE BRAND-NEW POWER 98, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ON MY ALL-NEW AFTERNOON DRIVE-TIME SHOW THERE WILL BE NO FORBIDDEN TOPICS. SO GET READY TO RID YOURSELF OF HANG-UPS. GET READY TO BE SET FREE. SO DON'T BE SCARED. DON'T BE SHY. WHAT DO YOU SAY, CALLER NUMBER ONE?
