(woman breathing faintly) - [Man] It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Don't be sad. I don't want it to be, I don't want it to end sad, okay? You're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. (cosmic synth music) (banging on door) - Hello? (door banging continues) Delivery! Hello? Uncle Bow! (banging on door) - Yeah. Hi, sorry, I wasn't sure I was gonna answer. Do you see a rock at your feet? Underneath it's a 20. I want you to take the money, leave the food, and then go to your car and honk. So I know you're gone. - (scoffs) Are you serious? - [Aimee] Sadly, I am. Fine, then you don't get a tip, except I already left more than enough for the tip, and I'm not really in a position to come out and get it. So please just leave the food. (horn honks) (Aimee sigh) Only for you, General Chow. (distant police sirens) (breathing faintly) (breathing continues) (distorted pop music) (distorted music continues) (somber piano music) You can do this. - [Automated Voice] Floor LL. (boss speaking muffled) (heartbeat pounding) - Are you listening to anything that I have to say? - Hm? - I was. Are you one of those different ones? - I don't know what that means. - Ms. Andrews, are you okay? - Definitely not. - If you have any questions, my office is that way, but Ms. Andrews don't have any questions. (indistinct office chatter) (phone rings) (ringing continues) - [Woman On Phone] Hello? - Hello? I mean, hello. - [Woman On Phone] It's about time, I've been on hold for 10 goddamn minutes, so I'm getting around real. (phone slams) (phone rings) (phone slams) (phone rings) - That's too bad. This job isn't that hard. - It's just not what I'm looking for right now. - What are you looking for? - I don't know. (somber bell music) (breathing heavily) - How's it going? How's your Monday going? - I had a panic attack and then quit my job. So Garfield was super right. - Yeah, he's a prophet. I'm Mel. - Aimee. - Think about it, okay? It helps. (somber music) - All right, everybody, let's, let's go ahead and get started. Martha, how about you start us off? -No. - Damn. Dude, give me a week and I'll be hitting that. - [Jamie] Didn't even talk to her. - Alright, give me two then. - Hey, idiots. I don't know if you know this, but you're both adults, like full grown adults. - Uh, that's debatable. - Right. - Since you're feeling so chatty, then James, why don't you get us started today. - Oo-wee. (sighs) - Hey guys, I'm James. Everybody calls me Jamie. - Hi, Jamie. (group laughs) - Hey, we don't do that here. That's okay. It's okay. I really, I appreciate your enthusiasm. - Yeah, right. I'm still having trouble leaving the house. - Are you still smoking? - Fuck yeah. - Hell yeah. - Is it helping? - It is a bit, but I really have to talk myself into leaving the house. You know, when I finally do, I can't breathe. The, I feel like the air gets tighter around me and it makes me realize how broken I still am. - Holy shit, yes. You see people following you too. I mean, like, hallucinations, figures in the dark, when you try to leave or at night or when you try to go out. It's not important. - So you are like, for real crazy, huh? (laughs) - James, why don't you go ahead and take a seat. I, I think what James is talking about, and, and to a certain extent, our new friend is choice. Hm? Or the fear of choice. Hm? We ask ourselves, what have I done? We, we blame ourselves. What have I done wrong? And these choices, they can haunt us. But I choose to move forward. I choose to keep going. I, I choose to. - To be afraid. - So long as it's your choice. - Glad you came out. - Yeah but I already messed it up. - You made the first step. - [Counselor] All right everybody, let's go ahead and let's get started. - Back to it. (repeated shushing) (group laughing) - Open your eyes in. - Oh god, this nightmare. You know that right? - Hold on, you'll never guess. (sighs) - I really hope this isn't a- - [All] Surprise! Oh my- - Woo! - Yeah - God. Wow. - Are you surprised? - Yeah, it's almost as if I said I hated surprise parties. - Well, that's what makes it surprising. - Oh my God. (friends celebrating) Thank you so much. Man, what's up, dude? - Happy birthday, dude. - How are you? My god, I can't believe this. (upbeat pop music) - [Friend 2] Happy birthday. (indistinct group chatter) (pop music continues) ♪ Stealing glances from beyond the door ♪ ♪ I hope that your eyes stich mine ♪ ♪ The sudden romance that I can't ignore ♪ ♪ Your on my mind all the time ♪ - I have something for you. - Okay. ♪ The way you say my name send chills right down my ♪ (unseen man breathing heavily) (door knocking) - Whoever that is is late as fuck. - Come in! Do we know you? (dark synth music) (heavy breathing continues) (gun fires) - Aimee. - Hey, can I sit here? - Hey, what are you doing here? - Try to go grocery shopping but had to find a place to hide. - Well, you've certainly picked the perfect place because no one ever reads. (chuckles) No, but this place is cool. I live in the house next door and they just let me come here and chill so I don't have to pay for anything. - Nice. - You cold? - Not really, why? Oh, no, I just like it. - Hmm. - So are you a witch or something? - Yeah, something like that. - Always kind of wanted to read books like this. - Oh. - But I don't know. Well, let me take you down this rabbit hole. - [Aimee] Okay. - [Mel] Yep, start with this one. It's. Okay. Psychic Perception by David Wheeler is a must read. But please tell me, am I boring you yet? - Do any of these talk about why we're here? - Sure. There is an answer for everything in these books. You just can't look for specifics. I'd like to say that everything is connected, and this is all just a way for us to find the person we're meant to be. But it seems the most logical answers, that shit just happens. Take a look at the Christ story. God sends down his only son to save us all. He gets here, meets us, and. - Shit happens. - Shit happening. It's the downfall of our society. That's my favorite. Talks about the brain, how the brain is our most powerful tool, and how our perception dictates our life. - That sounds terrifying. - (chuckles) No. No, see, I like to think that we have this whole universe and everything in it, but without our brains, without the power to perceive, it's all just meaningless. - And you believe all this? - Probably not if I, I really thought about it. It's, it's just nice to believe there's more to all this. I wanna believe. - You okay? - I just, do you know why I'm in group. The first day I got my license, I got into a really bad car accident. The very first day. And I couldn't walk. They weren't sure I was ever gonna be able to again. And then one day my friend brought me all these new age books. It was a joke. - How long did it take you to walk? - Learning how to walk again is something. It just, it takes so long. And people forgot and just got on with their lives and meanwhile I was stuck in bed. So all I could do was just get lost in my head and read fucking these books. - All I've been trying to do is find a purpose. What happened for me? For something. - Yeah, I did that. Now I'm just trying to find the strength to get back in the goddamn car. It just, it makes believing in all this not seem so crazy when the real world is just total bullshit. - Earth, fucking hate it here. (both laughing) - Oh, Ms. Andrews, wait up. I, I'm glad you're coming around. How, how are you doing? - Anxiety attacks. No sleep, depression. Hitting all the cliches. Sometimes it just feels like. - You're getting lost up there. - Yeah. - Are you on anything? - Anxiety meds. I'm running out. - How does that make you feel? - Like security blankets only work if you have the insurance to keep buying them. - (laughs) Well, you're funny. That helps. Have you tried counting your breaths? - Does that really work? - Staples are there for a reason. I want, I want you to try it. Close your eyes. - Mm-hmm. - Take a deep breath and just count to five. - And if that doesn't work. - Count to 10? (chuckles) - It doesn't have to be like this. You don't wanna hurt anyone. (robber breathing) - [Mel] So you really wanna know? - Of course I do. - Fine. You're not all that bad. You're kind of funny and semi cute. Super semi. - Thank you. - These moments don't want us, do they? Because as soon as he comes out, you just go back to being mini Brad. - I don't have to be Brad. - Sure. I just don't have the time or the interest to find out. - So are you saying the only way that this would work is if he didn't exist? - Pretty much. (Aimee chuckles) What's up, butter cup? - I got your own copy in case you wanna be an X-Man. - Oh my God. Thank you. I thought we settled on witch. You take a look at it yet. - Started it. And then it got to the part about preexistence beings who can alter perception and they failed as creatures or something. - Base angel thing? - Yeah. I took a break at those guys. - You're gonna give up when things get extraterrestrially weird. You're never gonna finish these books. They're written by crazies. - Then what does that make the readers? - Enlightened. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. Hello. - Whatever. I can still laugh. Smile. It's like I'm standing still. Like I'm trying to fix something that isn't even there anymore. An empty space. - Just, just because we can't see purpose doesn't mean that it's not there. Uh, space is meant to be empty so that we can fill it. - Noah could have gotten past this. He could have moved on. I didn't even get to say goodbye. It's all just bad memories that I can't get past. Maybe I don't want to. What if it's all I have left? The empty space. - [Man] It's okay. Everything's gonna be. - Everything's gonna be okay. (somber music) (robber breathing heavily) - Yeah, I was reading this book. It's super good, you have to read it. Woo. - Given it back. - No, let me try it on real fast. No, no, no, lemme just try it on. (laughs) No, no, no. - Come on now. - You know, this thing is pretty ugly. - It was a gift. - Who gave it to you? Some thrift shop? Some boy gave it to you? Oh. - You know I, oh, I really. - Fuck you. Fuck you. You act like a dick all you want but everyone can see right through you. Just makes you fake and sad. Even your friends have to pretend to like you. - I'm, I'm sorry? - (laughs) You're such an asshole. (Aimee breathing heavily) - It's okay. You're okay. It's okay. Okay, you're okay. (dark synth music) (Aimee shrieks) - I have something for you. - Okay. - You know, actually I was looking for that. - Really? - Yeah. - That's funny because I actually found it way in the back of the closet. By the Christmas stuff. - Well, I thought I looked Christmasy. - Uh-huh. - And so I put it back there. I don't know. - Okay. You know if I'm gonna have fun at this party. - Which you already are. - Which I already am, I'm gonna need you to have fun as well. - Mm-hmm. (pop music) - It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. - [Robber] Get up against the fucking wall! - It doesn't have to be like this. - You're lying. You're fucking lying. - You don't wanna hurt anyone. (gun fires) - It's okay. Aimee. (dark synth music) - Don't go with him. Don't go with him. - Morning. Come on. - Is this a dream? - I hope not. Come on now. How do you like your eggs? Oh, that's right. Scrambled. - What's happening here? Noah! - I'm cooking you breakfast. - You're dead. Breakfast is the least of my worries. Am I dead too? Am I in heaven? Is this heaven right now? Heaven sucks. - You're not dead. And this isn't heaven. - If you're a figment in my imagination, I demand you stop existing. Like right now. - Hey. You should eat. - I don't want fucking breakfast. Go back to being dead this instant. - I can't. I don't know if it's just some cosmic mistake or if it's a miracle, but I'm here. I'm real. - I really hope I'm not just talking to myself right now. I can't. - Oh my gosh. To have fun as well. - Mm-hmm. It's okay. - Everything's gonna be okay. - (breathing heavily) One, two, three, four, five. - Hey, Aimee, you're early. - Breathing thing. It does not work. - Everything okay? - Crap, you're a priest. - Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. - I'm not really religious. Is that okay? - Yeah, I'll be, I'll be religious enough for the both of us, huh. - Can I talk to you? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a, I got a little bit of time. Sure. - So you think I'm crazy? - I think everyone needs some help. (chuckles) am I wrong? - Jury's still out. - You know that there are places that you can go and. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Let's say something happens and all your problems are suddenly gone. How do you know it's real? How do you believe in something again? - (chuckles) Like what? - It's hard to explain. - Wait. You're not asking me permission to do drugs or anything? - I wish I was still on drugs. No, I'm saying no to drugs. Let's say it's a person that I think can help. - Oh, I think in that case, there's no definite answer. (chuckles) You just, you trust yourself to make the right choice and, and when you don't, you have the courage to change it. - Are you sure you're a priest? - The only faith that you need is the faith in yourself. - Faith, huh? - I'm pretty big on it. (bell rings) I got, I've got it. - Yeah, yeah. - Running a little late. - Yeah, okay. (bell rings) Okay. I just want the record to show that if I'm crazy, I'm very aware of it. - And? - Fuck it. - I think I'm doing pretty good. I think I'm getting better. (Aimee whistling) - Sorry. (laughs) I've been so scared of everything. Even if this isn't real. - You don't have to worry anymore. Everything you ever wanted is right here in front of you. Goodnight, Aimee Andrews. (Noah laughing) - And then Kim threw up on Archie because she was so hammered. - I thought you were passed out by then. - No, no, no. I, I remembered. - Oh my gosh. So what happened to you? I mean, you're pretty much a superhero. - Thought you didn't care about that. - I don't. It's just, aren't you a little curious? - Well, this isn't heaven and we're not in a dream, if that's what you're thinking. - Yeah, we covered that part. But didn't you try to? - What? - I don't know. Find God? Meet John Lennon, Tupac? All I've been trying to do is find something, anything. - When you're out there, all you can do is watch. Just stare into the darkness and hope you see anything. If you found out God could only lead you, us. Would he still matter? - So he saw God? - Saw, but never heard. Wasn't able to feel, touch, love. It was you. Your warmth. That carried me out of the darkness. Out of the void. Even in your darkest moments, you lifted me up. You helped me more than you could ever know. - Noah. (ominous music) (door knocks) - Hey. I tried to catch you at the meeting, but. - Yeah, sorry. Things have been a little, lately. - Right. New boy? Is he here? Can I meet him? - Um, not right now. - [Noah] It's your birthday. - It's your birthday? - Wow, yeah. How did you know that? - Lucky guess. - Well, can you guess that I'm having a party tonight at Hope and Anchor? You need to come. - I'm not sure, I might have plans. - Well, you can bring plans if you want. - She's smiling. She's worried about you. - Why? - Because I feel like I haven't seen you. - Right. I'll try to go. Really, I will. - You promise? - Of course. Look, I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon, okay? How come you didn't come out? - I didn't want her to see me. - Why? How'd you know it was her birthday? - She kept thinking about it. I could hear it. - Hear her thoughts. - It's not a big deal. It's all out there. And since I've come back. - So can you? - Sure. Sure. It's not scary. It's just different. - Holy shit. Stop reading my thoughts. - You don't like it? - Hell no. - Oh, I, I didn't think it would matter. - Let's just keep all our conversations on the outside of our bodies, at least until I get used to your new ghost powers. Okay? - I'm not a ghost. - All of this is just a lot to process. I need a minute to handle how I've changed. - It's just me. I told you there's nothing to be afraid of. And nightmares don't mean anything, no matter what happens in them. - I told you to stop. This is all just a little- - [Together] Unexpected. - Don't look at me like that. Don't look at me like that. Please. (dark synth music begins) - Ah! What the fuck? - Sorry, are you okay? - Shit. No. I just got punched. - Can I help? It's been kind of a creepy day. - Ah, I guess I kind of, kind of deserve that. - No, not you. Well, not today. Why are you following me? - Oh, I was coming to tell you, I'm sorry. And then, and then you cold cocked me. - Oh, well, sorry again. And thanks? - Yeah. I dunno, I just, I really am sorry. Sometimes I see myself acting the way I act and I can't stop myself sometimes. I just, I'm scared of not knowing what's next. I just, I can't lose everything again. But if I can kind of control what happens, maybe make people feel the way I want them to feel. Even if it's not great. I, I don't know. You try to be a cool dick for so long and then suddenly, suddenly you are. - You don't get to get away with that just cause you're having a hard time. We all are. - I know, I know. That's why I was trying to say, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like a. - Okay. I accept. Just remember, dicks aren't cool. They're gross. - (laughs) Yeah, well. (Aimee sighs) So are we vibing now? - Wow. Not even a little bit. - Sure? Okay. Too fast. (phone vibrating) Hello? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I did talk to her. I did. No, no, no. Check this out, bro. She's totally into me. I told you. Nah, nah, nah. Dude, it's gonna happen. It's all about being patient. So, hello? Hey, hey. It's that downtown reception, man. It sucks. Let me call you back. All right. (Brad choking) - [Noah] You're having a bad dream. It's just a bad dream. A nightmare. You're okay. It was just a nightmare. It's okay. You're just having a nightmare. You're gonna be okay. It was just a nightmare. Hey, are you okay? You were having a nightmare. - Yeah, something like that. - Your head is a real mess. I can get lost up there. - Hey, you're not supposed to be up there. Remember? Sorry, I just don't like the idea of you up in my head. - How would you even know? - What? - How would you know? How do you know we're not there right now? (somber piano music) - Oh no. - You're fighting me. - This is wrong. It's all wrong. (dark synth music) - Let me in. - No. - All right. All right, everybody, let's get back to work. Jamie, have you seen Brad? - No. - Hey, have you seen Brad? - Jesus, Aimee. - Sorry but have you seen him? - No, why? - What do you think dreams mean? - What? - Dreams, could they mean something more? - I read somewhere that dreams are just our unconscious mind tapping into that power. - Power of our mind? - Yeah. It frees us to run wild and see the future and the past. - How do you know which is which? - Yeah, you don't. Not consciously, anyway. - [Aimee] Damn. - Yeah. That's astrology, babe. It's all theory and no answers. Why, have you been having weird dreams? Is that what's going on? - You could say that. - I might not have all the best answers. I'm not even sure this is all real. Isn't there someone else you can ask? - The Priest. - Aimee, what's going on? - Nothing. I'm okay. - You don't look okay. - Can I borrow those books? - Sure. I've been kind of checking them out. Hey, remember, your brain is your most powerful tool. Don't sell it short. - What if I'm not in control of my brain? - It's your brain. You have all the power. - Thanks. There's gotta be something. What is happening to me? - [Noah] You're just dreaming. Just dreaming. You're just dreaming. I have everything you want. I can give you everything you need. I can give you the answer. I have, I have answers. But you have to come home. But you need to come home. Come home. But you have to come home. Come home. Come home! We should go inside. What's wrong? - Nothing. You just scared me. - Scared or scaring? - You're so different now. - My eyes are open now, Aimee. I've seen so many things. I, I just wanna share 'em with you. - I don't know. I don't think I can trust you. - Why? - What if you're not who you say you are. - Of course I am. Look, the way I see it, there's two options. A: you're crazy. And this is all just in your head. - Or. - Or B: This is real. I'm real. And you just refuse to accept it. Which do you think it is? - I need to go. - You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. - No, I need to. - Okay. If you have to go, then go. (door knocking) - Whoa. Dude. Hey. - I had to knock on so many doors to find you. - You know phones exist. - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. - Holy shit, Aimee, you look like. - Have you seen Brad? - Who? - Brad, you know Brad? - I don't remember Brad. I remember Paul. - He's like your best friend. - Brad, Brad, what's up, Brad? - Come on, Jamie. - Does he smoke? - Mel, what about you? No, the older guy. That's Paul. - Not Paul. I'm talking about Brad. - Sorry, pal. I'm drawing a blank. Look at this rat giving himself a bath. (both laughing) Look at him just. (speaking faintly) - You guys are together? Since when? - [Jamie] Uh. - You better know the answer to this. - Oh shit. - Were you that high? - Yeah. (Mel scoffs) - Okay, no, I know. It was summer. Or was it fall? - Are we that bad? - Brad's gone. He's really gone. - Oh, no, Aimee, maybe we just didn't meet him. It must have been. Had to be real. It's almost like he never existed. - Hey, whatever it is, it's gonna be okay. - Don't say that. Don't ever say that to me. - Aimee. - What the fuck? - Is he really dead? Or was he never dead? And now he's back and two choices. It's just two. Is he in my mind, figment of my broken brain? Or if it is Noah, something's missing. Something. - What? Missing something. - Human. Missing something human. - So why don't you get rid of him? - What if I'm wrong? What if he's everything I want? - I, I think one of the mistakes that, that we make, we all make is that we think that what we have, what we have is what we want. - What kind of mistake is it if you had a demon in your house? Alien or whatever? - I, I, I. - Aimee, what the fuck are you talking about? - Martha, Martha. - No, I, I mean, you show up here, you look like shit, and you sound like a crazy person. - That's what you decided to say is your first words. I'm trying to figure this out. So either help or shut up. - Aimee, I'm sorry. It's just, I'm worried we're all just worried. - What's happening to me? (somber bell music) Oh, sorry. - It's okay. - Brad. Brad, where have you been? - Just a little sick. - Oh, I thought. - Is something wrong? You seem a little tired. - No, I'm fine. I just have a lot on my mind. - You should go home, get some rest. - No, I'm okay. - I still think you should go home. It'll be safe there. - Hey, how come you never called me after our date? - Oh. That. You still seem hung up on your ex. I didn't want to get in the way. - My ex is dead. And you know that. - Noah's waiting for you. - What did he do to you? - Time to go home. - Let me go! - Where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide? - I decided to try, try to get out of the house. I ended up at McDonald's. (laughs) I wasn't even hungry, but I went in and McRibs taste bad. Like really bad. - I need to talk to you. It's an emergency. - Yeah, okay. Yeah, give us one minute everybody. Huh? Let's, let's go outside. - I'm sorry for interrupting, guys and for being a bitch. You're doing great, Martha. I'm really proud of you but your grays rock. - You can beat it, Aimee. - So I went to the park and there's this guy, Brad, who you don't even remember because no one remembers him. And then he was like, Noah's waiting for you and Noah's at my house. So then Noah's there and he is dead. And I know you don't believe me. Is there something like this in the Bible? Like in the end part? - Not in the Catholic version. - I need your help. - Okay, Aimee, okay. Okay. - I know how it sounds. What if it's real? I mean, he's there. He's right in front of me. - Like, like I right now. - No, obviously not right now. Please, I just need you to believe me. I need somebody to believe me. - I just, I don't see the purpose. - Just because we can't see the purpose doesn't mean it's not there. - (laughs) Look, grief it does funny things. Especially when there's no closure. - No, this is something different. Something evil. - Aimee, let me get you. - Do you believe me? - Aimee, I. - Then how can you help me? - Wait, wait. Aimee! Oh wait. - [Noah] What if you found out God had abandoned you? Who's that? Come into the light? No Heaven, no Hell, just eternity. - This isn't really a religious group. If you want. - Would his absence inspire you to search for his love? Or would it make you hate him? - All right. I, I, I think you need to leave. - You people's lives mean so little and you do so little with them, and yet you get all his attention. Hell is too good for you. And yet you get all his attention. - What are you doing? - I'm erasing you. I have to know. Would you do it again knowing that you'd be forgotten? Would you still help people? Would it even matter? - It'll be the only thing that matters. - If he's not coming back, I'm gonna eat those cookies. (static sparks) - Basically, that's where we're at. - So Noah came back. - And killed my best friend. - Not killed, exactly, maybe, but yeah, he's gone. - So you're saying that's why we can't remember when we got together? - Yeah, because Mel hated Brad and you were always around him. And so if he's gone, there's nothing getting in the way of you two. - But why though? (laughs) - Who knows? - Well, maybe it's, if it got us together, it's not that bad of a thing. It, it's a good thing. - I mean, maybe, maybe. But let's not go with the something good scenario just yet, dude. - So what do you plan to do? - I don't know. - Can I talk to you in the kitchen? - Yeah, sure. - I have to do something. I have to stop him. I have to. I dunno. Tomorrow you don't remember me, I want you to know that I kept trying. I didn't stop fighting, okay? I wish there was something that I could do, think I could give you to prove that I was here. That I was real. - Aimee, I'm not gonna forget you. - Just remember that tonight you had your first kiss with a girl, if nothing else. - Okay? - [Aimee] It's like I'm standing still. - How come she didn't just take a picture of you guys? Wouldn't that last longer? - Oh yeah. Kind of wish she had been the first girl I kissed. - [Aimee] Trying to fix something that isn't there. - Doesn't seem okay. We should do something about her. - I know. - Let's keep an eye on her. - Okay. - [Aimee] The empty space. - [Noah] Why don't you come in? It's not like you got anywhere else to go. (indistinct TV chatter) - Why are you hiding from me? - I'm not. I'm just clearing my mind. - When you left, I had no idea what to do. It wasn't like I was gonna chase after you. I knew you'd come back but it just took so long and I got bored. And then I thought, I know what it is. I know what she wants. Grand gestures. That's what you want. - No, you're wrong. - Stop it, Aimee. Stop. You're confused. And now you're confusing me. Look at him. He doesn't even know we're here. Look at him. You recognize him? - No. No. - I need you to move on. - I won't be a part of this. - I need you to stop living this life to be grand. Can't you see what I want? - I don't want it. - What do you want? You want reality? You want the real world? Fine. (snaps fingers) - What the fuck? - Get out of here. - What? - You need to get out of here now. - It's you. - I don't want anyone to get hurt. - Just tell me what I did. - Please don't. - I was high. I saw what happened. - You don't remember? - I was high. - I don't care. You don't get to forget what you did. - We can go to the cops. I'll turn myself in. - Enough. - It, it can't be. - Get out of here. - What's happening? - Noah, stop. (robber struggling) - His life is over. - I'm sorry. (robber groans) (static sparks) - What did you do? - He's gone. Pretty soon he'll be just another faded face, gone from your memory. - You're not Noah. - Of course not. (laughs) Noah's dead. And I wonder how long have you known? Maybe since the beginning. I guess I couldn't really pull him off. Could I? But you chose to believe anyways. - What do you want? - Love, I told you from the beginning. - This isn't love. This is manipulation. A lie. - A lie you chose to believe because of love. You need me. Even if it's just me. Aimee! Aimee, how could you? (breathing heavily) Come over here? It's beautiful. Most humans can't appreciate beauty like this. I wanted you to appreciate it but your mind kept taking us back to that house. I don't know why. - Where are we? - Just then when you touched me, when you pushed me without me allowing it, no one has ever touched me like that. I guess I'm rubbing off on you. - I don't want that. - Well, it's happening. This is happening. We're happening. Can't you see? We're meant to be together. - What do you want? - This, this emotion that I'm having, this love that I'm giving to you. We're becoming one. This is what it's all about. - You don't know what love is. - Then show me. Show me more. Be with me. While you still have a choice. - She's still answering. - Mel, let's go, it's the fastest way. - Fuck. - I want us to be one. One mind, one being. One everything. You want answers? We can find them. We can shout at God until he opens his door. We'll show him real power. - Power. - That's right. - I want something first. What? - Close your eyes. (somber music) - Why are we here? - It's time to say goodbye. - You're doing the right thing. - Everything's gonna be okay. - No. - We're here. - For real? - Yeah. - Turn off the engine. Holy shit. I rode in the car. - Fuck yeah, dude. - Okay. Let's get Aimee. - I'm sorry, Noah. I miss you so much. But I can't give up. But you're not Noah. You're a collection of thoughts made in his image. He was more than that. He could be a real dick. - Dude, your family is fucking weird. - You. - What are you talking about? She is mean to me. - And tries! He was also the sweetest guy I ever met. Well, it's kinda. Shut up. (Noah laughs) He was more than just memories. He was something I could feel. Something you could never understand. Wait, something isn't right. - Something human. - Stop it. Stop. Stop. - I'm ready to let go. - Get out of my mind. - We're not in your mind, Noah. We're in mine. - Aimee, don't. - I always hated this thing. - Aimee, Aimee! - Aimee! - Aimee. No. Don't. (gun fires) - [Both] Aimee, Aimee. (gun fires) (energy surging) (door pounding) - [Mel] Aimee! (door pounding continues) - Aimee. What's going on? - Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. I'm gonna be okay. (somber music)
