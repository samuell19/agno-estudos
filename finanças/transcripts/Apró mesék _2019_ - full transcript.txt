He Was the best shooter in the company. After your husband. Are you good for music? What? We gave him? Your first deer. You did before? What?

His mustache was pointed. What does it say? Vince... "All against everything, and God against all." HAPPY CHRISTMAS HAPPY CHRISTMAS Where do you think it is now? In a good place. In the sky?

I Won't deny that you're still in my mind I will not deny... Vince told me how good mother you are. What else did he say? That you are a very good wife. You can stop now. Vince has never been to Russia. He served near Belgrade, guarding a copper mine. At least he wrote. Yes. And then they transferred it. As I said, you can stop. Your husband saved my life. My husband is a monster. If he returns home, I will kill him. If you knew him, you wouldn't be proud of your friend. I Don't understand why you lied about him. Excuse me. You caught me. And... does it feel bad? Will I feel bad. I answered an ad. In honor of a guy I met in Kursk. In Return, his parents gave me a coat. Without that coat, I could freeze that winter. Some give me money, others food, sometimes I stay. But everyone does it with pleasure. Of course, because everyone gets what they want most. A huge lie. You give them hope. Is the same. Need help?

We were supposed to sleep tonight. Svetlana Virgil! Virgil! Can you hear me? Virgil! Virgil! Virgil! Virgil! Virgil! Virgil! Virgil! Virgil! Balázs... My friend. I was barely alive when I arrived in Dubovoy. Then the Russians arrived. I fell to my knees and begged the lieutenant, a young man. Doctor... Find a doctor. A Russian boy, I said. Please help. I was frozen, they could barely take it off. Where did they take her? They took Svetlana to a place, and me to another. To the copper mine of Dobovoy. I was a slave for two years. Everyday. From morning to night. Pushing the mining truck, extracting copper. And, if not for you, if thinking of you would not have kept me alive, I swear to God, I would have fallen dead right there. Did you listen to music? We dance tango with Mama. T-A-N-G-0. Tango! You can read? Uncle Balázs taught me. Is that my shirt? I borrowed it, if you don't mind. Balázs helped in the house. Who knows what I would have done without him. When you came? A few weeks ago. - We hunt a deer! - Do not! Uncle Balázs blew the horn. You ate it? We sold it. Come, I'll show you my hat! I wanted to talk to Uncle Balázs. It's late. I will go to bed. You still don't tell me anything about yourself. I will do it in the morning. Father! Goodnight friend. Belgrade... Your letter said you were in Belgrade. It Is true. Then they transferred me. Truth? Yes. You said they didn't know each other. - It is not true. - How do you know about Svetlana? By Virgil. He had time to question it. Why does he pretend to meet you? I don't know. You are his wife. Judit! Will you come to bed? I'm going! If he touches me, I will kill him. If you lied to me, I will kill you too. Good Morning. Are you hungry? No thanks, not yet. But it's good. I did gánico. You did it? You only need potatoes, flour, onion. Gany for breakfast? Do you know how much I wanted to eat it in the mine? Tell me, what happened to you later? After what? After finding Svetlana. I went to Budapest. They caught me two days later. Did they let you go? Escape. When did you get home? In January. God was pious in letting us return home safely. You pushed me. I'm sorry. I will go for firewood. You said you would Kill him if he touched you. You love Me? You know I love you. Then go hunting and come back alone. We will tell Virgil that it was an accident. I will not Kill your son's father. Will you expect me to hit it again? I can go? Stay to peel potatoes. Listen to your mother. I still don't thank you. You took care of him. Why did you say we knew each other? Why did you say it? You lied to them. I am not a hero. I did bad things in the war. But I returned home determined... ...that things were different. That's why I said I knew you. Because I want to be the man... You understand? The man you told them he was. I want to be worthy of my family. That is why fate brought us together. Not to forget the man he used to be. And the man I want to be. Do you like mushroom stew? I will make it good and spicy. We don't shoot at anything. I Won't deny that you're still in my mind. I will not deny that your mouth still burns in mine. I will not deny that my dreams belong to you. I won't deny that I'm still waiting for you. I Won't deny I'm still in love with you. I would like to see the notary. Tell him I came back. To avoid problems. Do not need papers? They know me I can enter? Ahead. I thought you were selfish, but you are worse. You are a coward. Uncle Balázs! They have dad. - Where? - In the city Hall. He said to go find you. Will they hang dad? They will not hang it. Go tell your mother that everything will be fine. Márton, tell Vince Berces what he told us. - He knows everything. - Tell it to your face. You killed my son. You took your Luger and shot him at close range. I have three bullets. Here, here and here. You abandoned us on the road. When and where did this happen? In Öttevény, last October. I don't even know where it is. They took us to forced labor. To the Belgrade copper mine. Private Berces was the cruellest of all. He whipped us like galley slaves. We Prayed that they would transfer it. - But we had no luck. - How did you get to Öttevény? When the Russians arrived, we went from Serbia to Germany. Walking? If someone couldn't do more, they would take them out and kill them. My son was thin and weak, that was his crime. And mine was to see what happened to him. My son... ...was 28 years old. Did you see similar incidents? We hear shots. Those who took out did not appear again. Did you know if Vince Berces participated in the executions? I'm sure. But he didn't see or hear it. He killed my son! Do you have proof? What did he say? The people here know me. They know that I am an honest and hard working man. They recruited me. Fight for our country. I even killed. But only enemies, by obligation. I suffered enough. I'm finally at home. All want is to live in peace. - Do not believe anything. - I'm sorry. I feel what happened to you. You need a scapegoat, but it's not me. You confuse me with someone. - Can you tell me rat? - Silence please! Balázs Hankó, do you know this man? Vince Berces. We serve together. Where? In Belgrade on 41, Then in Dubovoy on 42 and in Schuchye in Don Bend. - Lies! - If you interrupt me, I'll kick it out. - To me? - Yes. Where did you serve next? We both deserted. They caught us separately Vince Berces, what happened to your service records? The Russians took them and forgot to return them. You burned them! Hankó, do you know this man? Of course not. I wasn't there. Did you see them together? Do not. Did you see Vince Berces committing a war crime? Do not. Do you put your hands to the fire for Vince Bérces? Yes. How could he do that to my son? Take it out! Berces lies! But why? You two stay here. Remains...? Is there deer meat left? Yes. Fifty kilos for 50 weeks. If you do not comply, forced labor. I will comply. You always need a good hunter. Thank you. He called me rat... He Killed my son in front of my own eyes... That rat. I swear to God... I don't want to keep fighting. But if I see you near my family, I kill you. Stay here and translate the report. - I'm in a hurry. - Then do it immediately. Thank the commander for letting go. Father! Did they let you go? Yes son. Where is Uncle Balázs? He returned to Budapest. I had things to do. Will not return? Do not. "Tell Vince Bérces what he told us." "He knows everything." "You killed my son.” "My son was thin and weak." "You want a scapegoat.” "He whipped us like slaves..." "But that's not me." "Do you know this person?" "We serve together." "Lies" "If you interrupt me..." "You told me rat." "Did you see them together?" "Do you put your hands to the fire for Vince Bérces?" "Yes". Why? What did you expect? What will let me ruin my family? You ruined it. I changed. I survived the war for you. Unfortunately. I'm sorry. Virgil! Come! We are going. Go back to your room. Your mother and I are just talking. - Truth? - Come. Stay there until we finish. That was the last time I hit you. I promise. Stay here. Son... Go to your room. Stay there or I'll give you too! Why don't you let me love you? Virgil! Don't hurt mom. Let it go. Virgil, do you listen? Why the fuck did you come? Why do not you leave me alone? Where are they? Not even for a moment... What do you all want from me? What did you do to them? The knife. In the boat. Look there. Virgil, do you listen? Do you point to your own father? Don't hurt mom. I will not do it. Run! Run! Help me! Strip! Judit! Virgil! Judit! Virgil! Judit! Damn bitch! Virgil... In the boat. Look there. Feledi. It didn't leave me alone. I will declare that it was in self-defense. It was. Followed me. Up to this point. - I was going to do? - Where is Judit and the boy? I threw them into the water. In water. You too! Enters. Did you hurt them? What did I do to you? It was you who took my wife! Vince... Ahead! Let her go! Virgil... Stay here. I will send help. That was the last time I saw Balázs. Any idea where it went? I wanted to disappear. Depressives are told that they smile since morning. Because, if they pretend to be happy, then they will be. But I never heard of someone pretending to be a hero... ...and that it became one. I did not pretend. A small clear autumn. A poem that brings your voice closer. The past comes back for a minute. The old melodies disappeared long ago. Go back beyond hundreds of memories. For many years A lifetime away. END
