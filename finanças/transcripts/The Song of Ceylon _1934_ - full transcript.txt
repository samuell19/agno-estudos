In ancient times, all the low pads of this land were covered with dark and monstrous forests, through which no man might pass without peril. In those days, the primitives did prostrate themselves by night to the honour and service of the devil. These rites they celebrated until the coming of a great god whom they call Buddha And to whom the salvation of souls belongs. Him they believed once to have come upon the earth, whence he departed from the top of the highest mountain on the island, called in the Chingulay language, Hamalell. But by the Portuguese and the European nations, Adam's Peak. It is sharp like a sugar loaf. On the top, a flat stone with a print of a foot like a man's on it but far bigger, being about 2ft long. it is the footprint of the Buddha. The people of this land count it meritorious to go and worship this impression and generally about Meir new year, which is in March, they, men, women and children, go up this vast and high mountain to worship. Up this vast and high mountain to worship. Our Buddha, who acquired nirvana, who came into the world like other Buddhas, from whom is derived the food of life. Who is celebrated for his 32 great manly beauties. And for the 82 signs connected with them. And for the light which shines a fathom round his body. And for the beams of light that dart from the top of his head. Who is the preceptor of three worlds. Who is acquainted with the past, present and future. Who during four asankya kalpas so conducted himself as to be an example of the 30 great qualities. Who subdued Mara and his attendants and became Buddha. In the eighth year from that event, he rose into the air, spread beams of light of six different colours round his person and stamped the impression of his foot, bearing the noble marks, chakralakshana, and the 108 auspicious tokens on the rock, Samantakuta Parvathi, which is celebrated for the cold and lovely waters of its rivers, for its mountain torrents and for its flowery groves spreading in the air their sweet-scented pollen, which is the crown of the Virgin Island, rich in mines of all kinds of precious stone... ...like a maid decked with jewels. At sunrise, a great shadow is cast from this mountain for a space of 70 miles, formed, as it seems, of strange vapours. For it lieth not on the land but a little above it so that the hills and the valleys appear veiled beneath. It belongeth only to the women to fetch both wood and water. Their priests are debarred from laying their hands to any manner of work. Nor may they eat but one meal a day, which meal they must make with the people, who willingly give out of their store for the merit they gain thereby. But husbandry is the great employment of the country. In this the best men labour. Nor is it held any disgrace for men of the greatest quality to do any work either at home or in the field, if it be for themselves. But to work for hire with them is reckoned for a great shame and very few are here to be found that will work so. They are very active and nimble in their limbs and very ingenious. For except ironwork or other things they have need of, they make and do themselves, in so much that they all build their own houses. Rice is the choice and flour of all their corn, at reaping they are excellent, good, just after the English manner. As they join together in tilling, so in their harvest, also. For all fall in together in reaping one man's field and so to the next, until every man's crops are down. The women beat the rice out of the husk, which they do with an ebony pestle in a wooden mortar. In those villages where dancers have their dwelling, the children must come each day to the house of their dancing master, there to practice themselves in their art. Or if they be not exercised from childhood in this manner, their limbs have no skill in the postures of their dance.
