I MARRIED A SHADOW Damn it... Not qualified, they said. What do you think? Am I qualified? It's no use asking me. Well, they know where they can stick their plant. Who wants a job like this anyway, huh? Can we go somewhere else and have a rest? Yeah, great, you go have another rest. I'm tired! I'm sick of you nagging me. I'm pregnant, you shit! Why not just go and have it in the woods? Like the Indians did. No problem. You can make like a squaw. What are you doing? You can't just pack up and go. Is it work? There's no more work. What? I don't understand. I've had enough, enough of you, enough of the baby, I'm going. Understand now? Get off! I'm through with you. Frank! You'd leave the baby? And you. I don't feel well. Was it work? Is that it? Did you get fired? Get out! Out! How long now? Pardon? I'm expecting too. Eight months. Eight months, two weeks. Me too. Do you want a boy or a girl? I don't care. I want a boy with blue eyes and blond hair. You think it's possible? That's his dad. I'm Patricia. Patricia Meyrand. And this is Bertrand. Are you going to see your family? Yes. You're travelling alone? Isn't your husband here? You should give him an earful. He has a lot of work to do. So what? He can't just leave you on the train. Don't worry about her, these train trips get her worked up. Rubbish. He thinks every time I'm in a good mood, I'm worked up. Listen, when I was in America all the women I saw stood up for themselves. You lived in America? Yes. Got some money, got married. What about you? Helene. Helene Georges. Helene, have you ever been to California? No? Doesn't matter, it's all mountains and deserts, if you like that stuff. One time I was perched out over a ravine, mesmerised. I was above a sheer drop, staring into the void. My life was over, my boyfriend had left me. Suddenly, I felt this enormous presence. This hand touched my shoulder. It was him! And from then on, I was his! Settle down a bit. It's not good for the baby. Is that really how you met? You want to hear the real story? Here it is. It's a beautiful day and I'm walking along past a gallery I went in and saw this man looking at a painting. I went up and asked him if he was an art expert. And this strong voice replies No, my business is grapes. And there it is. That's how our big romance got started. Is that true? It's not exactly how I remember it. It's all true, and then after that we made a baby and got married. Or the other way around, I can't remember. Watch what you're doing! Oh, look at your dress. For heaven's sake! Sorry about that. I don't know how that happened. You knocked her when you got up. Do you want to change in my compartment? No, it's all right. You can slip it off and I'll wash it for you. You can't wear it like this. Let's go. Back in a minute. Here we are. Take it off and I'll give you one of mine. It's okay, I can get my bag. It's no problem, it doesn't matter about these dresses. I won't need them in a couple of weeks anyway. I hope it fits, I'm a bit bigger in the middle than you. I bet trains are like hotels. No washing clothes in the sink. It's nice. Can you hold this for me, I've already lost one of them. Here, give me that. I'll wash it. No, no, it's my pleasure. Put it on if you want. Go on. Taking it off is supposed to be bad luck. I don't believe in bad luck. Are you feeling all right? There. - Is that better? - Yes. Where are you headed to? To Bordeaux, to his parents. I've never met them so I'm a bit nervous. Maybe that's why I can't keep my mouth shut. They know about you? Well, they know I married Bertrand and we're having a baby. That's it. For all they know, I'm a brunette. Will you go back to the States? No, Bertrand was only there to do some research on California wines. And to marry me, of course. He works in the vineyards on his family estate. Where's your compartment? I don't have a compartment. You were going to sit the whole way? Everything was all booked out. Well, you stretch out here and get some rest, I'll be back in a bit. Okay? Why are you doing this for me? It's nothing. Go on, get some sleep. Shh, it's all right, just sleep. Congratulations, madame. You've had your baby. Everything's fine. It's a boy. The nurse will bring him here. But now you need to be strong. For you and your baby. I'll see that you're given a sedative so you can sleep. Here he is. You want to hold him? Here, he's yours. Go ahead. He won't break. What is it? Can't you sleep? My god, you're so tiny. Listen. Listen, it's your mother. I'm not doing so great as a mama, huh? My name's Helene. Helene Georges. And you're my darling. We'll be happy together. All right? That's fine. I'm happy too, little one. My dear. My love. You can't stay too long, she's still quite weak. Is she sleeping? We've got her on sedatives. Patricia, I'm Mr Meyrand. Bertrand's father. And that's my oldest, Pierre. My wife wanted to come, but... the doctor said that she shouldn't. She's too distraught. No, no... Don't try to talk. Don't talk. They showed us the baby, he's a fine boy. A wonderful baby. It's a tragedy, isn't it? Patricia, I want you to know that we're ready for you to come to us. That's if you want to come, of course. I know that you don't have any family... so we're offering you ours. It's not perfect. We have our faults, eh, Pierre? But, ah... We all get along together well. With you and your child there... I'm sure you'd fit in very well with us. After all, you're my son's wife, aren't you? Now that he's dead, as far as we're concerned you're our daughter. But sir... No, no, I realise that we don't even know each other... but we will. Anyway, it's something to think about. I shouldn't mention this, but... I know my wife is looking forward to seeing you... and your baby... It'd give her a new lease of life. It's been hard for her. Yes, terrible. I think Patricia's feeling tired now. Yes, yes, my boy's right. I hope you'll live with us. With all my heart. And if you need anything at all, for you, or your baby... It was good to see you. Bye. What are you doing? The other woman...there was another pregant woman on the train. Go back and lie down - she was killed, you're lucky to be alive. But I was in her compartment, it should have been me, not her. - Now look, Mrs Meyrand - - I'm not Mrs Meyrand! All right, you're not Mrs Meyrand, and that wasn't your family that... That wasn't my family, I'm not married, my name is Georges! Helene Georges! Everything you're doing is wrong, you don't understand. See now, you've gotten yourself all worked up. But I'm telling you that you've got it all wrong I'm not married and he wasn't my husband. A man spilled something on my dress so I wore one of hers. All right, just lie down and I'll go and get the doctor. All right? You're just going to sit quietly, okay? Hello, Patricia? This is Madame Meyrand. I just - It's all right... What's going on here? Shouldn't you be in bed? I'm going now. You can't just walk out, this isn't a hotel. Please go back to your room, Mrs Meyrand. But I'm not Mrs Meyrand. And I'm not a nurse. Now will you go back to your room and stay there. No, just listen to me - I'm not married and I don't have a family. Well, you can stay here then. Where else are you going to go? Where? - Somewhere. - Nowhere. And what about your baby, have you thought about that? If you've got no family and no husband what's going to happen to him? Now go and lie down, you can both stay here but no more running around, huh? No need for it. Patricia Meyrand. Maiden name Fortin. 27 July 1949. Thonon-Les-Bains. Patricia Meyrand. Bertrand Meyrand. So...what's all this about? You're not Mrs Meyrand? Who are you then? Pardon? Patricia Meyrand. All right then. Now how about going back to sleep? Forget about it. Hello, my daughter. Hello, Madame. My name's Lena, just call me that. Only strangers call me madame. You can just call me Papa. If you like. And that's Nellie. The commander-in-chief. Maybe you'd like to go up now, huh? Don't worry, you'll get used to her. Nellie's right though - you go on up. Do you want to hold him? No, no, later, thank you. Has Bertrand eaten? Are you breastfeeding him? I don't have enough milk. Would you like something to drink? Lena, why don't you show Patricia her room? You get a bit lost at first. But you'll get the hang of the place. That's the drawing room and that's Pierre's room. He wanted to bring you here himself but he couldn't make it. There you are. You can arrange everything here how you like. It's yours, so do whatever you want. It's wonderful. The bathroom is right over here. And in here... a few things for the baby. And over here... there's a few bits and pieces. I got these while we were waiting for you. I hope the clinic didn't give me the wrong size. That looks about right. You didn't need to, madame. It's nothing, and don't call me madame. I know how you must be feeling. But don't worry. Will you try? Do I serve dinner now, madame? Not just yet Nellie, I'll tell you. I'm very glad you're here, Patricia. ...you'd better get that tractor to the garage. I've told you already I'll do it. All right, take it easy. I'll take care of the tractor. Patricia's probably asleep. I'll go up and see. Now quit worrying about the tractor. Good evening. I was just going to go up and check on you. I was in the bath. Come sit down. - Baby asleep? - Yes. Sorry I'm late. Don't worry about it, you don't need to apologise. Excuse me, I raised my mother very badly. Yes, I tried to help him but it didn't do any good. Are you two finished now? Don't listen to anything those two say Patricia, they act like I've no idea. As you can see I'm just an old woman. Go on, try some. I know Mr Pessac must have seemed strange when he brought you here. He's just a bit quiet, that's all. No, he was all right. He lives here. He's our estate manager. Bit rough around the edges, but okay. Where are you from, Patricia? I was born in Thonon-Les-Bains, July 27, 1949. My name was Fortin. It's not an interrogation, Patricia. All our son wrote was that he'd married a beautiful French girl... with no family, that's all. You don't have to say anything you don't want. It's hard to talk about myself. You don't need to apologise, only a loudmouth likes talking about themselves. Do you know anything about wine? Bertrand didn't take you to the vineyards? Try some of this, Patricia. It's our own. - It's good. - Not bad, eh? We sell 30,000 bottles every year all over the world. Well, not exactly the whole world. That's an understatement. It's strange he didn't take you. He never talked about his work? I don't know. I can't remember. He didn't talk about it. I suppose I'm not surprised. - But... - You're looking tired, Patricia. You can go to bed if you want to. Yes, Pierre's right, you go ahead. Patricia. How did you meet my son? How did it happen? It was at the Grand Canyon. Looking over the edge. And Bertrand said... We were looking at paintings. That's it, an art gallery, paintings. But the paintings, he didn't... Don't ask me, madame. I don't want to talk. I should go. Excuse me. Lena...you shouldn't have. I know. I know, I'm an idiot. I was just getting the baby's bottle. Patricia, this house is yours. It's your home. You need to get that into your head. Will you try? - Yes, madame. - Lena. "Yes, Lena." Would you like to sit down? I hope you'll forgive my nosiness. I know it was stupid. Bertrand's death was like the end of the world. I won't talk about it any more. I never depended on anyone, not ever, Patricia. I never asked anything from anybody. It's not that I'm proud, that's just the way it is. But now I'm asking you to stay. With your son. - Madame, I have to tell you... - No, wait I have to finish, I'm not much good at talking about myself either. But that's not important. Pierre's a good boy. Maybe he's a little...well, he keeps things to himself and I don't always understand him, but he's good. My husband, Matthieu, nobody in the world can compare to him. I didn't love him enough. And now it's too late. It's a terrible thing to say. "Too late". Well, we can't do anything about that. I've never talked to anyone like this before. And I don't know you. All I know is you loved my son, and that's enough. I'm very ill, Patricia. It won't be long now. So I'm asking you to stay. That's it. I need you. I'll stay, madame. We should live and be happy. Then we're all better off. Well, that's it, Patricia. When I was your age I wanted sons, not daughters. Now I wish I'd had a daughter. Is that okay? Yes, that's fine. You better turn off the gas, the water's boiled away. Shit! How much of this is yours? There...there... The forest there, and a bit farther. There's a cabin in that forest. Bertrand and I built it one year. Did he ever tell you about that cabin? He probably didn't want to you to find out, we used to take girls there. Do you want to drive? Is it difficult? Have a try, come on. Hold the wheel! Good, straight ahead. You're a natural. Patricia, this is Fifo. She's the house cat. She slips in and out like a cat. Hello. - Fifo, this is... - I know who she is. Fifo's father is our estate manager. Pierre let me drive the tractor here. Pierre. Pierre. Come on, Pierre. Dear friends, you have heard the message of the lord, which has prepared our souls and prepared our hearts, to comprehend the holy sacrament of baptism, and do you truly desire that this child recieve this holy sacrament? We do desire it. Bertrand Matthieu, I baptise you in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. Get in closer together. Okay, everybody looking here. Smiling now. Smile a bit, please. Here, take my arm. Tightly. Helene! That's enough now, stop it! Ready? All set. Let's go. Hey! Toro! Toro! Come over here, it's all right. Whoa, bossy! Go on! Go on, get. There we are. Almost done. THE AMERICAN FRIEND You have any friends in America? What? Any friends in America? You lived in America, right? Yes. Ah, not now! Don't get wet, Patricia. Go on, get out of the rain. Great, that's all we needed. Do you like fountain pens? Really? You want one? Let's go in then. We'd like to look at some pens. Of course. The fountain pens. Quite a few. How do you choose? Don't ask me. I guess they're all pretty much the same. This one. - Can I write something? - That's what it's for. "Pierre Meyrand" That's not bad. Is it a good pen? Well...I guess so. You try it. All right. Do you have any envelopes? Works okay? Yes. Good. We'll have this one. And the envelopes. - How much? - 110. Patricia! Maybe you hadn't noticed. But we've got showers at the house. I like the rain. You've hardly eaten a thing, Patricia. I'm not hungry. I know, Patricia... This must all seem pretty small after the wide-open spaces in America. But I find it has a charm. Don't you think so? Yes, it's nice. I know it's not grandiose, I mean, not like Colorado... Did you ever go to Colorado? No. I'd really like to go there one day. And the great plains of Texas. It'd be great to see them. You only stayed in California, then? No, I sort of moved around. Were you studying there or on holiday? Just travelling. And Hollywood. The stars. You must've visited the movie studios. - No. - No? Never?? Well, you really missed something there. What about New York? Did you see New York, the Statue of Liberty... Please don't keep bringing up my past. My past is gone. Looks like I'm an idiot too. My god, my god, what a fool. Oh, Bertrand...I'll never get through this. Never make it. And you weren't sleeping. Why aren't you sleepy? Am I intruding? Do you want some wine, Patricia? I wouldn't mind, thanks. - Take me home. - Wait a minute. Is it because of me? I want to go now. What's the rush? Patricia, you're supposed to be resting. Why? Why? Because it's late, that's why. Well, I don't want to have a rest. Don't do anything, then. Don't you like me? Do you really want to know? I'm talking to you. Don't you like me? Patricia, just take off. Do you even know me? Anything to say about that? Well, go ahead. Tell me. I've got no idea who you are. Apparently you were married to my brother. Maybe, so what? My brother was my brother. But I'm me, and I don't have to to look out for my brother's wife. I never said you had to. No, nobody did, just forget it, I came here to listen to music, not you. I'm not going to argue with you. Maybe you shouldn't like me. Madame Patricia. Madame Patricia, wake up. What is it? You have to get dressed, they're all waiting for you in the drawing room. Waiting for me? Why? I don't know, a lawyer's there. You're not going to go back to sleep, right? Good morning, dear. Over here. This is Mr Basseau, our attorney. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, madame. - Good morning, Patricia. - Oh, excuse me. Good morning. Patricia, Mr Basseau has to tell you something, so listen carefully. Go on, Jacques. Yes, well, if I could sum it up in a few words... Your mother-in-law has just revised a condition in her will. Whereas originally, upon her demise as well as the demise of her husband, an equal distribution was legated to the two brothers, at present... well, at present one third of the inheritance goes to her son Pierre... the rest reverts to you and your son Bertrand. But I don't want it. You mustn't do this. It's already done, madame. It's not possible. Why not, Patricia? What is it? Is it because of Pierre? He suggested it. But you can't. You can't do this. Give me my son. Is something wrong? Don't, Bertrand, don't cry. I'm sorry about last night. I was drinking. It happens sometimes, I don't know why. I even pass out. Are you hungry? Forget anything I said last night, Patricia. Maybe I'm just not at ease with you. It'll change. It's nothing. I guess you don't feel like talking. You never do. Do you want anything? Talk to me. Should I beg you? Why did you do it? Do what? Change the will. Well, let's see... Let's say I did it for... for Bertrand. And maybe my parents. That's what they wanted. I suppose it was for you, too. I won't accept it. Why not? Because it's from me? Then accept it from my parents. Accept it for him. Want to know something? Look at me. If you'd accept it I'd be very happy. Well. It's up to you. Good morning, goodbye, love you, love you, love you. - Where are you going? - Fishing with Pierre. I think your mother's gone crazy, my dear. Can you grab some oars and that jerry-can? That's the boat. Not exactly a luxury yacht. It's very cute. - Patrica... - Yes..? Do you really think we can row with those? Oh, I got the wrong ones. I'll get them. Want to take a swim? Didn't bring anything. Doesn't matter. Aren't you coming in? - Is it good? - Great! What, in your clothes? Battery's dead. What happened? The jeep battery's dead. You could have phoned, you knew I'd be worried. - Look... - When did you get back? You know when we got in, you didn't sleep till you heard us. 2 a.m., you mean. Nellie, what's up with you today? I'm OK. Good morning, dear. How's Bertrand? Fine, he's asleep. - Morning. - Morning. Oh, the mail. Nellie, will you take the newspaper up to - Of course, off to the Master of the House. Give me the paper, Nellie. - No, I'll get the blame. - It's all right, I'll take it up. Okay, if you want. There's a letter for you, Patricia. For me? Patricia Meyrand, that's you. WHO ARE YOU? What is it? Is it bad news? An old friend. It's long ago now. It's good to have friends. You can never have enough. I better feed Bertrand. You have to be careful with her, Pierre, she needs our help. Tell me what's going on. - How's it going? - All good. WHAT DO YOU WANT? Another letter this morning? Yes, nothing important. It doesn't look like nothing. Oh, what's your hurry? Good morning, Madame Meyrand. Do you know where Pierre is? He's gone into town, but he won't be long. Okay, bye. That Fifo, always rushing about. She's jealous of you, Patricia. You must have noticed it. Maybe. Not maybe, definitely. See you later. Here. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. There's nothing to say. Have you been sending me letters? Me? Write letters to you? What the hell would I write? I don't need to write anything. I'll just say it. And do you have anything to say? Yeah. I know what you want. And let me tell you, you're not going to get it. - Want what? - Oh, don't play dumb with me. You want Pierre. We can all see it. It's all over town. You wanna know what they're saying? Yeah, tell me. Okay, then. You'll never be satisfied with just the inheritance. You married one brother first but now you want it all. I know you're after Pierre, he told me. He said that? Yep, that's what he said. Go and ask him. "She's crazy about me, I wish she wouldn't be so obvious." He's always talking about it, he thinks it's funny. That's right, just a joke. It's me he loves, Madame Meyrand. Go ahead, tell him. Get me fired. It's so stupid. What the hell are you doing? So I'm just in it for the money? I married one brother and now I'm trying to hook you too? Then you just tell everyone I'm in love with you. You think that's funny? Did Fifo tell you that? Who do you think you are? Just get lost, I'm sick of you. Don't touch me. I'm not in love with you. - But I love you. - Leave me alone. - Did you hear what I said? - No, I didn't. - I'll say it again then: I love you. - Just stop it! Quiet! Quiet! I love you! I'm in love with you. Me too, Pierre, it's true... Oh, Bertrand. What am I going to do? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? Pierre! What is it? I just wanted to see you. Sorry. I'll see you later. What's going on? Let go of my wrist. Let go. See you later. Hello there, darling. I see you got my love letters. Pretty funny, huh? What, not happy to see me? You couldn't have forgotten me already. Frank. Frankie? Your sweetheart? It's unbelievable, I came all this way to see you and when I come to the door, there you are. Must be mental telepathy. That's it. How about a kiss? It's great to see you after all this time..how long is it now? Two years? Three years? Four? Time flies, huh? Seems like it was just yesterday. Going to ask me in? This must be your mother-in-law. Hello, Madame. I hope not not intruding. I'm Frank, an old friend of Patricia's. - Eh, Pat? - That's right. I think she got a shock seeing me, it's been a long time now. I was about to knock and then she suddenly opened the door. Pretty amazing, huh? Are you passing through here? Oh yeah, yeah, just passing through, I didn't want to miss the chance to drop in on Pat. She hasn't changed a bit. Still looks great. Looks a bit edgy though. Hey, Pat, it's just me. Who's this, Patricia? He's an old friend. Well, any friend of Patricia's is welcome here anytime. Frank Balit, good to meet you. I was in the area, so I took a chance. You were lucky, then. Did you know our son Bertrand? Bertrand? No. But of course, I... I heard all about what happened. It was in the news. I heard he was quite a guy. I'd like to have known him. Fortunately, we have Patricia and their baby. It's a miracle. Yes, life is a mystery, huh? There's a god up there. But life can drive us mad. Crazy. Would you like something to drink? No, I have to get to Bordeaux. But I'll be back. I'll be back. Are you planning to live around here? Well, that depends. I'm not sure yet. I'll be sticking around, anyway. Call you tomorrow, all right? All right. Who was that guy? Just a friend. That's all, a friend. Don't give me that crap, who was he? Someone I knew before. And this? Pierre, don't ask me. Fine. Are you okay? It's nothing, dear. It'll go in a minute. You're not in bed? Could you go and get my medicine over there? That round box, see it? Do you think we should call the doctor? No, no, it'll pass. I'm so lucky you're here. You wouldn't leave, would you? No matter what? Don't worry, nothing's going to happen. I know. My little pigeon! My darling! I'm all choked up at seeing you again. I thought I'd lost you forever. Lemme look at you. You didn't bring my kid? No, you're right. Too dangerous on a bicycle. Here. See this? I bought him a present. And you. Open it. What do you want? Aw, don't be like that. Look. Nice, huh? He'll have fun with this. Look at the bubbles. There's Helene, Helene, pop! Goodbye Helene, hello Patricia. What is it? Kinda snappy today, aren't you? Just tell me what we're doing here. You wanna know how I found you? I read it in the news. I always think it's important to stay abreast of the times. What? You think you can walk away from this? There, look at that. You should read the whole thing. Patricia Meyrand, rich heiress returns from America, husband doesn't survive train wreck. Et cetera, et cetera. That's gotta be a mistake, I thought, because it was your picture there. It didn't click for a couple of days. Because I was so broken up with worry, I called the clinic. Just leave me alone, Frank. Asked a couple of questions, and what did I hear? Madame Meyrand has gone to her family's estate in Bordeaux. And then I got it. And you know what I thought? Helene - or Patricia - Praise the lord because you just hit the jackpot. What do you want? What do you want? Want? Me? You, my pigeon. You. You're crazy. Yeah? Tell me why. You're the one who ran out with our kid. Okay, so I got a little pissed off, fair enough. But I'm here. You were the one who walked out on me! You want to know the truth? I came here for my boy. That's what I want. I need him. - I need him. - You're crazy. You've gone crazy. He's my boy, my dear. My little boy. It's my right to take him. My son, Helene. My son. I want cash. A lot of it. You'd better get it, I don't care how. I've been watching you for two weeks. I've learned things. I know... you're going to inherit the estate. And you're married, right? That's how it is. Now you're going to help me. You're not going to share? Not anything? Then I'll do something. No Patricia Meyrand. You'll go to jail and your kid will end up in foster care. When you get out you'll have nothing. No home. Just the street. Sure you don't want to help? You know how easy it was to find you? I was at a restaurant in Bordeaux. Had some Pontet-Canet: "Property of Meyrand". There is a god after all. Or we'd all go crazy. I'll go straight to the press. And then the police. It'll be everywhere. Everybody will know. Your boy won't escape it. Or your business. And it'll hurt you too. You don't want that. I have an acute sense of human psychology. After the scandal you won't be able to look at anyone in the village in the eye. You don't deserve to live. They say we all live in fantasy. Not true. Isn't it fair for me to get a cut? All that money. How couldn't you afford it? Think about it. Do you know, Helene...or, if you prefer, Patricia? You understand her? She likes you a lot. What has she told you? She's suffered. What can you do? Nothing. Get out. Life is complicated. Pay me off and I'm gone. That's it. Simple as that. Stay right there. Why did you do this? Why did you do this to us? No, Madame! Patricia! Patricia! Come back here! Tell me, why...why... Patricia... Lena. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Don't go. You can't go away. I need you. Nellie! Nellie, come here! Nellie! I can't tell you anything right now, we should let her sleep. That's all we can do. When are Pierre and Matthieu getting back? I'm not sure, they're in Bordeaux today. Tell them to get in touch with me when they're back. - You're not staying? - No, I have another patient. I'll come back when I can, Patricia. Hello, Pierre? No, this isn't Pierre. Frank, I've got to see you. Right now. It's important. What's up? You don't know how to blow bubbles? There's a forest near the house. I'll explain later. I'll see you there. Middle of the night, huh? So? Patricia. Patricia! My name is Helene Georges. That man was my son's father. I'm not your sister-in-law. I'm not your brother's wife. My name's Helene. Helene Georges. I tried to tell them at the hospital. Then I started to pretend... that I was Patricia Meyrand. I liked the idea. Now it's sad. When I first saw you... You and your father... You were all so happy for us to live with you. Living out a dream. It made Lena happy. It was all so good. So good. We were all happy together. Pierre... Weren't we? Your name's not important. I love you. I love you. I love you. Pierre, go and see your mother. Make sure she's OK, Nellie. Come here, dear. Did you find her? Yes, mama. How is she? Okay. I don't want anyone to hurt her. It's over. That's good. I would've done the same thing. Bring me a pen and paper from the desk. I want you do to something. You're so tall, my dear. Take this down. "I, the undersigned..." Madame Patricia. Madame Lena wants you. I'm coming. - Lena.. - You don't need to say anything. Read it, Jacques. Good evening, Patricia. Every time we meet I have to read you something. Read it. "I, the undersigned, Marie Louise Agnes Charlotte Meyrand, spouse of Louis Matthieu Meyrand, in the presence of Jacques Basseau my attorney, serving as witness, before any legal authority requiring it, here and now avow having killed Frank Balit on the night of 16 October 1982." That isn't true. Keep going. "I killed him because he was menacing my family, my act was deliberate, I alone stabbed him, not possessing the physical strength required, I instructed my son Pierre to dispose of the body. Being in ill health but in full awareness of the seriousness of this act, it is my wish to declare what I have done so that it is brought to the attention of the authorities, in the event of any innocent person or persons being accused of the murder." Leave me now. Stay a moment, Patricia. Come here. Don't tell me anything. I just want you to listen to me. Pierre loves you. He doesn't get close to many people but when he does, it's deep. You'll marry and live here. I knew you were in love with him before you did. Life will go on. I know you'll think of me sometimes. I'm sure. I didn't want to... I didn't mean to... I know, Patricia. You never wanted to hurt me. I may have lost a son, but I found a daughter. Her name might not be Patricia. It's just a name. It's you, that's all. I'm feeling very tired right now. Oh, Lena. I love you. Is Bertrand asleep? Go and look after him. I need to get some sleep now, okay? I think you're going to like it here. Subbed by Badge
