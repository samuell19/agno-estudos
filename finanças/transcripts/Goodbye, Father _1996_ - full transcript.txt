GOODBYE, DAD. This year, my vacation was a bit different from other years. For the first time in my life, I spent time with my father. Every other year, I've just gone to Sintra, with my mother and grandmother. We stayed at a huge, old house that belonged to my grandfather, and spent the entire summer there. But this year was different: what I've always dreamed to happen: I spent the vacation with my father. I've never been much with my father. At our house, I never see him because he always arrives late, when I'm sleeping. He spends his life in reunions and travelling, or stuck to his laptop or mobile, and never has time to be with me. Every night, I'd stay in my bedroom waiting for him to come to see me, but my father never once came to my room. He never cared about me. But this vacation, one night, my father arrived earlier, he got changed, grabbed his travelling bag, walked into my room, sat on my bed and said: Filipe, this year we'll be spending the vacation together! Us both, together! I was overwhelmed and so glad, that I didn't say anything. Do you want it or not? Yeah... - We're going by plane? - Yeah... I'll show you the most beautiful place I have ever seen! It was the first time I ever went on a plane, and I wasn't scared. We flew above the clouds, as if we were crossing a sea of cotton. The place that my dad wanted to show me was the Azores. Only later I remembered that I've heard my mother talking about these islands. My dad slept the entire trip. He looked very tired. I wondered if he meant to spend his vacation sleeping. Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent. Please fasten your safety belts. Wanna hold my hand during landing? I was in the middle of the clouds, with my hand in my dad's for the first time. I thought if it might be better to pinch myself, just to be sure I wasn't dreaming. When we arrived at the Azores, the first thing my dad did was buy some newspapers. At the store, I asked him if he could buy me some crayons and a notepad, so I could draw. Why haven't you brought some pencils and paper with you? Because I didn't know if I wanted to draw something... - When did you know? - When I saw you buy those newspapers! The taxi driver was a very tall African with very gentle eyes. When we looked at him, we felt he was going to hug us. Would you have liked to go to Sintra instead? No... Won't you miss your grandmother and mother? Why? I spend all year just with them! We stayed at a lady's house, whose name was D. Paula who always walked around with her pockets full of little birds... D. Paula was lame, and once in a while, when she held her glasses to ask questions, she reminded me of my teacher. The house was smaller and poorer than ours. It was a simple house, cheered with little furniture, but all quite pretty. In one of the rooms, there was a painting with a face of a sailor... It's my dad. He was a sailor and a republican. He died in the Spanish war... When my father died, I was three years old. I don't remember him, nor being on his lap, nor holding him or listening to his stories. It's been sixty years, that I've been looking at this portrait and I think of what my father's voice would sound like and his smell. You know your father's smell? Want a little bird? Thank you, D. Paula. We like this house very much and we're going to stay here. Come on, Filipe, let's pick your bedroom. You like this house? Don't you feel like chatting? What D. Paula said about her father is sad... What? That she doesn't remember about her father? No, not that. If she was a little girl when he died, and couldn't remember him... So what do you think is sad? That he never told her stories? Didn't your father tell you stories when you were a little boy? Yes... - Were they good? - Yes... My dad enjoyed telling stories very much, and listening also... He said that life without storytellers couldn't be good. My teacher said that when we tell a story, we're saying who we are and what we like... Why did you want to come here with me? Because we've never been together... I know that! But why did you want to be with me all of a sudden? Because I suddenly realized that I had a 13-year-old son whom I didn't know, that doesn't know me, and maybe in need of a father... Right? Filipe, I never told you stories, because I don't know how. Everybody knows storytelling... There are plenty of things I haven't done with you, but this vacation, you'll have me by your side every day and night, ok? What do you want to do tomorrow? I don't know... Wanna go fishing? Ok... You know how to fish? - No... - That's ok, I'll teach you! What are you reading? You like to read? And writing, too? Sometimes... Don't you have a diary? No... I had one when I was your age, Where I wrote everything that happened to me... I started writing it when my father died... Well... see you tomorrow... See you tomorrow. Sleep well. Are you happy to be here with me? I was glad my father was with me for the first time, but I also felt he wasn't as happy as he tried to look. And I thought it was very strange to be with him in that house on that island, the both of us alone... Give me the hook and bait please. Give me the hook. Pull there. Yeah. Go on, keep pulling, slowly, slowly, this is done slowly. Yeah, that's right. Done. Dad! I'm glad you've got a hold on your fishing rod. You don't have a high fever... Here, drink. Shit! It's boiling! It's bitter! That's because it's good for you. Want me to bring your magazines? My head hurts... The best you can do is try to sleep. If you want to pee, do it here. Don't go to the bathroom, so you won't get a cold. Think you'll do a poo? So you don't need any toilet paper. Want something else? What are you going to do? I'm just going for a walk: don't be afraid - I won't get lost. Close the curtains a bit, if you please... Have you ever gone fishing? Was it because of me you went? You don't need to do stuff you don't know, just to please me. The first time I saw Joana, she had her back to me, in the middle of the room, playing a violin. And looked like a vision. I was so stunned, that I totally forgot my dad and understood what love at first sight really meant. Who are you? I'm Filipe... I'm Pedro... How old are you? Thirteen... I'm fourteen already. What's your shoe size? 37... Mine is 42. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No... Never had one? - So... never touched a girl?! - No... Never kissed? I'm gonna have to teach you everything. You're here on vacation with your family? I'm alone with my dad. And you guys? We're alone without our dad! Did he die? No... two years ago, he went to America to work... never came back, and now he wants a divorce from our mother. - Why? - Because he met another woman! Our father fell in love with an American woman, and wants to get married to her... - And what are you going to do? - We're going to get him! - You're going to America? We are. If your father left, wouldn't you go and get him? I don't know... Joana, is it hard to live without a dad? Hard enough, if he leaves and doesn't care about us. And when we live with him, but he doesn't care about us? I don't know, Filipe, but that is probably worst... Why don't we get used to life without a dad? If he dies, we have to adjust, right?! yes... if he dies, we have to get used to it... I was chatting with Joana about my dad, but what I really wanted was to ask her: Joana, now that I know you, please don't go. What are you drawing? - My father... - Your father? Doing what? That's my father when he was a baby, with his mother changing his diapers... Who's that man in uniform looking at the baby? He is a sailor... It's my father's father, who is shouting at him. Why shouting? My father's father was a sailor, like yours, and when he came home from sea, shouted at my father, because he didn't like him, and started saying that my father wasn't his son... Oh, Filipe! What nonsense is that?! Mr.- Dr., your father was a sailor too? No, D. Paula, my father was a high school teacher; he didn't know how to swim and hated being on a boat! Why do you do this to your father? D. Paula didn't know us and didn't know anything about our lives. That's why she didn't know what I was doing. I wanted to set things straight with my dad. And the light that the sun gives me isn't enough to warm me. The love that the world has doesn't come to say, that it's all ok. You are never with me. And I grow up here behind you Without seeing your eyes. To the mirror I call someone, Hoping to find you here. I am never with you. I can't change the past, Filipe... I'm very sorry, but I can't. I would like this holiday helps you to forget it... I know that you've suffered much because I've never had time to be with you, but now we are here, the two of us together, and we can do all we wanted. What we never did... Why hadn't you any time to be with me? Because my work and my success... were more important than you. And I was afraid of becoming tied to you... You've never played ball with me... You have never come in my room, not when I was sick... You never wanted to know about my school... You have never asked me if I had a girlfriend... Do you have a girlfriend? Father, didn't you want me to be born? Did you or not? No, Filipe, I didn't... I always told your mother that I didn't want to have any children! Why? Because I always thought that kids tie us. They make us become dependent on them. Don't let us have the life that we want! Then why was I born? Because your mother wanted it. Filipe, I like you very much. Why have we come here? Because I have very little time to live. - Are you sick? - Yes. Do you have AIDS? No... I have a cancer in my lungs. And it has no cure? No... No it was discovered too late. When you are going to die? In a few months... Once I heard Mama telling Grandma, that you had the idea, that you were going to die in the Azores... - That's why we came here? - Yes... When I first saw these islands, you were not yet born, I wrote to your mother telling her that when I was old, I would like to come and die here. When the holidays are over, I'll be going back home alone? You will... Inside my chest, it hurt, as if they were sticking an iron into me. But because I didn't want my father to watch me crying, I swallowed the tears and said nothing else. Are the oxen going to be killed now? No - tomorrow. Today, they are introduced to the people that are going to eat them, to see how fat they are. And the holy spirit approves that these oxen are killed? For what it seems, he does. - Have you ever seen them killed? - Yes. They're given machete blows to the head. Then they open their chest and let the blood drain into some earthenware bowls. What a horror... That's the way. Are we going to have a snack? When I was in the war in Angola, I killed many black people! Old, young, men, women: everyone that crossed my path. one day, I had killed more than 20 blacks, when suddenly... Boom!!! My feet landed on a mine and I flew more than 20 meters high! When I fell, I didn't have legs and I was almost dead. And do you know who carried me on his back, during 2 days and nights, through the bush? A black! Yes, sir, a black!!! I had been enjoying myself by killing blacks and it was one of them that came to save my life! Two days and two nights, while raining, with me on his back, to the encampment! One black!... Big bastard. Do you know what he said when I thanked him? "Don't thank me at all, because the guilt and the sadness "that you'll feel for the rest of your life, "will be worse than if you had died!" And you, will you pay for a beer for Rodinhas? We'll pay! Father, Have you killed blacks in Africa, too? Yes... With a machine-gun? Yes... Wasn't it hard, to kill them? Yes, Filipe, it was very hard... If it wasn't to defend myself, I would never have killed anyone. Did you suffer a lot in Africa? A little bit... I saw some of my friends die... others became like Rodinhas. It was the war that changed you? Why do you ask that? Because of your old photos. Before, you had long hair - you never used a tie. You were always with men and women friends.You hugged mother a lot... It wasn't only the war... When the war ended, there was a big party in our country, and with much joy, many people thought that their lives... and the world and other people could change. But when the party was over, we realized none of it was changing, will never change, the world is what it is now, what it was yesterday and will be tomorrow. It's us that change, Filipe, When we grow up and stop dreaming. Did you stop dreaming? I like you too, dad. When I knew my father and his life, I understood mine better - and the world around me. And when we understand such things, we can start accepting them. Do you like the Portuguese people? Oh yes... It's a wonderful people - very kind... I like very much the American women... Oh yeah?! Why? Because they are special! - Do you have a boyfriend? - No... Has a boy never asked to be your boyfriend? Yes, but I didn't want it. Why didn't you want it? Because I didn't like them. They were younger than you? Some were, others not. I've never imagined that I would see the sunrise with you... Dad, what was your age when your father died? - I was your age... - How did he die? - He killed himself... - Why? - Because he was displeased with life... - Did you miss him a lot? I did... My father was a very good man, had a lot of patience with me. We were great friends... If he liked you that much, how could he have left you? I never knew why my father committed suicide, and my mother never wanted to talk about it, but must have suffered a lot... People kill themselves because they suffer a lot. You and grandmother became poor? We did... Why do you ask that? Did you marry mom to become rich? No, Filipe, when I married your mom, I was already a lawyer! - In her father's office... - Who told you? I always heard grandma Mariana telling mom that you married her to keep grandfather's office... Your grandma Mariana never liked me... Why did you marry her? When your mother got pregnant, your grandfather became furious when he knew. I was a simple trainee in his office... He demanded that your mother didn't have the child, but she wanted you... Then your grandfather made us marry... and made me his partner. - You could have married, couldn't you? - I could... And if you hadn't married, maybe I wouldn't have been born... Dad, do you regret you're dying? I do... For leaving me or for leaving your office and your success? For leaving you, Filipe. Eh! Eh, you there! You can't swim naked! I'm sorry, But we didn't know... This is not France here! In France, people swim naked! Not here! And if a lady or a girl walked by, and saw you that way? You think that's good? Do you? But we thought that no one walked by here at this time of the day... Ah you thought! But you thought wrong, because you didn't think of me... And if I took your clothes? Huh? How would you get out of there? But what do you want?! You want me to go there to talk to you, is that it?! That's what I'd like to see! Are you stupid or what? Ungrateful... One day you'll miss me... When I won't be here to look for you, you'll be sorry... And you, my boy, don't worry, you'll have it... Ungrateful... Bunch of ingrates... Were you born in Africa? Yes... - And what did you do in Africa? - I tamed elephants. - The big ones?! - The big ones and small ones. - How did you do that? - I talked with them, I gave them a bath, walked with them, played hide and seek, and at night told them stories. - That's true? - That's true! They never stepped on you? No. Elephants are very carefull with people that they like. Do you miss them? I do. Why don't you go back there? Because in Africa, there's much war and famine. And the elephants are all dying. Girls are like us: only think of sex! Maybe they think more than we do, there! They all want what we want: Bullfight! Do you know Paula from the pharmacy? Never been invited to go and weigh yourself, when her father isn't there? Yes, you're still a fledgling... With people like me, she takes them inside to weigh us and then it's a great bullfight. - Why? - What really takes your weight is the table. - What does she do? Everything! Everything goes! Only we can't end her virginity. The rest is what they want! Pedro... ...do you think your sister is like all the others? The hell she isn't! I haven't caught her, until now. But I bet that she and her teacher don't only play the violin! How old is her teacher? The hell do I know! About you dad's age! Sometimes younger girls prefer older men... They have a crazy notion that they have more experience than us. One more beer please! You are very quiet... - It's because of Joana? - Yes... - Are you in love with her? - I think so... - How long? - Since I first saw her... - And does she know? - No...! - Aren't you thinking of telling her? - I don't know... What do we do when we like a woman? We tell her... - Or we show her... - How do you show her? By being all over her; giving her attention; offering her presents; covering her in affection and kindness; becoming interested in her life; and her family... Does her brother know you are in love with her? He realized... When he taught me masturbation, he told me to think of his sister! Do you masturbate? No. But I tell Pedro so, not to upset him! What else did Pedro teach you? Everything!... - Everything!... - Yes, Everything!... Dad... Yes? What if I go to America with them? Would you leave your mother that way? No... I would go with them to America, and I would get a job there... Marry Joana. Then I would come and get mom. See, in America, people earn a lot of money! It doesn't seem bad to me... but I think you should consider it better. It's a serious decision... Why? Because it's always risky to leave people that we love. We can lose them. But then I'll lose Joana... It's a choice that you must make. Do we always have to choose? One of the most bitter things in life... are the choices we must take... Sometimes we fear growing up... And where is this boy going at this time of the night? - Nowhere... - Nowhere? So father knows where this boy is going this time of night, does he? So are we going to ask your dad? Where the boy is going this time of the night? - Nowhere! Get off me! - Let's ask your dad. Filipe! Filipe! Come here Filipe! Ungrateful. Bunch of ingrates. Are you really going to America? Yes... - Can I go with you? - You can... and your father? My father isn't everything to me! Your father will die soon... Why do you want to come with me to America? Because I like you. I like you too, but it's too soon for you to leave your family. You are more important than my family. When you're older, if you still like me, you will meet me... You'll get a boyfriend before I grow up. No. I promise not. Take that, for you to remember your promise. Did you leave here yesterday? Yes. Did you go to meet with Joana? I did... Did you tell her you were in love with her? No. - You didn't kiss her either? - No. Why do you and mom only make love when you go out at night, or on Sunday mornings? What?! How do you know that?! Because I was at the door of your room many times, listening to you and Mom making love. - Have you got up to go to our room? Only to the door... Have you never entered? No... I was always afraid to see... Why? At first, I didn't know what it was, I thought that you were hurting mom. Later, when I knew what you were doing, I was afraid to see... Please... - What do you want? - One gin and tonic... One gin and tonic?! Are you used to drinking gin and tonic? No... I was joking. I want a Coca Cola. One Coca Cola, a coffee and a sparkling water, please. Do you want a newspaper? No... Don't worry about me, you can read it all, I'm not bothered. Have you ever spoken to mom about your trips to our room? Are you crazy?! That isn't a talk to have with your mother! You don't... I didn't speak with mom, but with grandma Mariana... You spoke to grandma Mariana?! Yes. Who did you want me to talk to? With the neighbours? No... No, I didn't want you to talk with the neighbours... And what did she tell you? If I hear you and mother in bed... she'd make good company in hell! - It had to be! - Excuse me... Have you made love with other women, besides mom? - I did... - Are they all the same? - How the same? - When making love. Are they all the same? They are... well, they aren't... - I don't know! I don't know... - Don't you?! What a hellish conversation! Who do you want me to talk to about this? With grandma Mariana? No, I don't want you to speak with grandma Mariana... I want you to speak with me... Then tell me if women are all the same when making love! yes... all the same... Basically, women and men are the same... Like animals, like dogs, like cats... Now there are differences... People are different from each other... from each other... There are some more interesting... more interested... more lively... more... Damn! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know, there! When you grow up, you'll see! What age were you when you made love for the first time? Sixteen years old... Only then?! Can't we make love earlier? You can, of course you can... Then why didn't you do it ? I didn't do it because the opportunity didn't show up! What a conversation! Don't you like to talk about women? I do... What do you think of Joana? She is funny... Do you think I can ask her to make love with me? I don't know... well... maybe it's better... What?... Maybe you shouldn't ask her... - She's too old for me? - Well... Alright... I wont ask her. Poor father. He became so worried with my questions, that he didn't notice that it was one of the most beautiful days of the holidays. Finally, I could talk to him. Man to man, about the subject that every man likes. Women. Do you see, branco? Your father married Joana! And you? Don't you want to marry me? Heh? Don't you? Catch the branco, catch him! Catch the branco so that he's going to marry me, catch him! Catch the branco! Catch the branco so that he's going to marry me, catch him! Catch the branco so that he's going to marry me, catch him! Catch him! Catch the branco so that he's going to marry me! Catch the branco so that he's going to marry me! Catch him! You shouldn't have left your mother! It's your fault! We must never leave our mother! Mother... Mother... Mother... Wake up Filipe! There son, wake up! Wake up son! It's over, it's over... There... There, it was just a dream... I knew it had been a bad dream, but the pain in my chest was very bad. In dreams, it's harder to run away from the things that make us suffer, because they are inside us: in our heads. Come on, calm down, I'm going to get some water. Filipe, you have a visitor. Can I come in? You can!... - How do you feel? - Well... Do you still have a fever? I think so... Who told you that I was sick? - Your father... - My father?! Yes... - Are you leaving tomorrow? - Yes... Filipe... I like you very much. And I will never forget you. It was my first passion kiss... Until it got dark, I didn't open my eyes or move my mouth, not to let that hot, permfumed smell escape. The day that Joana and Pedro left, I realized that the holidays had come to an end, and then it was me who had to leave. Do you miss your mother and grandmother? No... - Is it hard to live with them? - Sometimes... The scary empire of women! Did you enjoy these holidays? Have you got everything right with me? Don't be sad. You will always remember me and these holidays! A gift for you. I'd like that the first thing you write in that diary will be a story told by me. Do you want it? Okay, so come and sit here next to me... On your lap? The music I'm always listening to is from a man whose name was Bach. He was a great composer, a splendid organist, and, above all, a great man and a friend to everyone: wife, sons, and all men. One day, he made a big trip and when he returned home, he found his wife and two of their children had died. He went to the graveyard, prayed for them, and when he went home he wrote in his diary: "My god, please make it so, that I don't lose the happiness inside me." My father didn't want to go to the airport. He told me that leaving in a taxi isn't the same as leaving in a plane. When someone gets in a taxi no one says to him goodbye forever... Suddenly, my father started dancing. I wanted my last image of him, to be a picture of love and joy for me. When I arrived in Lisbon, I had my father's smell stuck in my clothes. I will never forget him. Have you finished your essay, Filipe? Yes, teacher.. You can leave it here on the desk... What's going on? "Bye bye, father"?... - Your father left, Filipe? - No, teacher... So you left him? No, teacher... my father died... What?! Filipe!... Filipe!... Where are you going at this time? What?! Nowhere! I'm going home, let me go home. And who authorized you, boy to be going home? Let me go! Let me go! Filipe! Filipe! Come here Filipe! Filipe, come here! Ungratefull!... Hello Filipe... Hi. Your magazines haven't arrived yet. - I want to buy this diary. - Is it for you, or a gift? - It's for me. - So I'll give it to you. Thank you very much. - Hello. - Hi... - Do you want to go for a walk? - No... What's bugging you? You messed up in school? No... My parents sign the divorce today. Is your father here? No... It's his lawyer who signs it. Me and Joana: we're going to spend the Christmas holidays with him. I've already found whom my sister is dating with! - With whom?... - With Bruno from the fifth floor! I saw them in the garden, hand in hand, hugging and kissing each other... He rubbed her breasts and put his hand under her skirt... A couple of goes, and my sister's virginity is gone! Who's there? Is Pedro at home? No. He must be down there riding his bike. Are you Filipe? Yes... Do you want to leave a message? For my brother. No. Sorry, I'm in the middle of a violin class. Bye. Maria Helena had already come from London. She brought some beautiful suits. A little unusual for my taste. You should go there and do some shopping. That way you would rest. - I don't need to go out, Mamma. - Yes you do, get out of here, take a trip, do some shopping, meet interesting people. It's what I did when your father went out of the country. You're very quiet... Was the day at school nice? Yes, it was... What have you done? The same as yesterday... Haven't you done anything new, today? - I've done an essay... - About what? The last holidays... What have you told? Did you say about our trip to Sintra, and about Grandma Mariana's fall? And the way you laughed at me, and didn't help me? May I come in, Madam? Yes. The doctor's driver brought the goods. - Do you want anything from him? - Yes, I do. Ask him to come here. Filipe, do you know why your teacher wants to talk with me? No... She called this afternoon and asked me to call at the school tomorrow. Have you done something wrong? Good afternoon, Madam. Mrs. Mariana... Hello... - Good afternoon, little Filipe. - Good afternoon. Mr. Amadeu. Tomorrow afternoon I need you to collect me. To go to the school with the boy, Filipe. - What time, Madam? - About 3 o'clock. Okay? Alright, Madam. The Doctor's already told me that tomorrow he doesn't need me all day... Finally, on Sunday, you want to take little Filipe to the football, or not? Yes I want to, my lady! It'll be a great game! - You know if the doctor's coming this afternoon? - No, I don't, Madam. The Doctor said to bring the shopping and return for him, but he didn't say what time he's going back home... Okay, Mr. Amadeu, thank you very much... See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Madam. Madam Mariana... Good afternoon, little Filipe. See you on Sunday. Good afternoon. You only go to the football, if you go to church with me! For more than a month, you give me excuses not to go with me! - Mother... - What? You'd rather he goes to the football with that beggar instead of to church with me? Who knows what that man teaches him! Mother, can I go to my room? Yes... Mom, why haven't you done what my father wanted? Your father?... - What did your father want? - He wanted you not to allow me be born! Let him see what he can get, if he needs, tell him to use diferent names. For a lot of small investors, as usual. Ok, we'll go in now... About the one outside, speak with Sharon. And tell her to buy some kilograms of gold, through the offshore at Gibraltar... No, no, just the 2 million dollars we set free last week. This is getting pretty difficult with that Yeltsin. If the guy goes crazy, it'll be a big mess... yes, indeed, it's better jumping now... Fine, that's all for now. I'll call him tomorrow from Paris. Ok... See you tomorrow. Thanks... Hi? Carmo? Is everything alright? Is Jo?o at home? Are the kids good? Yes he is, should be alright; must be asleep, I haven't seen him today yet. Kisses. Jo?o? How did that happen? Good, congratulations! Our friend Jardim must be dying, no? Listen one thing, our first one will stretch the rope, right? Look, for me that's totally irrelevant. No, that's not the problem. If somehow, he falls, I will go down completely. No, it isn't just the bag. The question is that I have guys stuck in a bunch of constructions, in "Expo" and "Nova Ponte". If this changes... I'm completely screwed up. I can't, I'm going to Paris, the Nautic Saloon and see if I can replace the little boat. Ok, we'll have lunch next week. Deal. Bye, take care.
