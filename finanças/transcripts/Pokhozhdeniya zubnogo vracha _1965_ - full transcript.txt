THE THIRD CREATIVE UNIT Every night without trouble the moon rises like it's wound. It looks like someone visits it, lights it up, and then blows it out. It looks like someone visits it, lights it up, and then blows it out. You, ebbs and tides, you're subordinate to this moon in the sky. And no matter how impatient you are, ebbs and tides, you are ruled by the moon. But if the moon gets distracted for a moment, the waves go singing and dancing and go into hiding. And you?ll never know where they are gone: the sixth wave, the seventh wave the eighth wave. And now again, flying in the sky, the moon shines counting the waves. And now again, it can't tell how many waves were in the sea and how many are left. It looks like the wave has become itself - just a wave in the sea. just a wave in the sea. THE ADVENTURES OF A DENTIST Hello, I'm Chesnokov. At last! What happened to you? I got delayed. Hi Tanya! So I've arrived here. It's time to go to work but I can't bring myself. THE TOWN CLINIC Be patient a little bit. Hello, come in, please. - Me? - Yes. I'm Rubakhin. You must be mistaken... No. Get used to the fact that everybody knows everything in our town. Come in. Do come in. This is your workplace. Your instruments, your notebook, your robe. Get settled and begin to work. I will. You two, please come in. Sit down. Well, what's the problem? Let's take a look. Please. Here it is. Let's pull you up a bit. Put your head in there. Like this. Good. Does it hurt badly? Why don't you answer me? Don't turn away from me. Where does it hurt? Hello. How gloomy you are. Please, open your mouth. Do me a favor. It's clear. We have to pull it. Let me see your other teeth. Good teeth. But this one we have to pull. Doctor, don't anesthetize me. I don't like it. Why? It's better with an anesthetic. I'd rather suffer now but it'll quickly go away later. Well... If the patient doesn't want it, you don't have to use it. - Really? - Really. Go ahead. Excuse me... We'll pull it for now and later... It's done. Already? Yes. - What? - I didn't even feel anything. - It's impossible! - Doctor, I honestly didn't feel it. It's alright then. Well done. - Excuse me... - Yes? - You really didn't feel anything? - Absolutely. I'm asking because it's very strange. - It's impossible! - It's the medical science. You don't even need an anesthetic. Up and you're done. You really felt nothing? Absolutely. Thank you. Sergei Petrovich, people are waiting! Excuse me. Open your mouth. It's OK. Doctor, maybe I don't need a shot either? I'm scared of it. Maybe it's better to anesthetize? After all... Done. - What about my tooth? - Here it is. Why did I suffer earlier? Next. Did you see it? I was Chesnokov's next patient. Done. Already? Next. Let's see. Now go back to your mom. This is our teacher. And this is our new dentist. I've never seen a dentist like him before. Stop it, please! You don't have to tell me - I was there. Here. Yes, I remember. I should have preserved that tooth as a keepsake. You really didn't feel any pain, did you? Absolutely. If you knew in what awful mood I was coming here... It's OK to tell now. I'm an impressionable person. At the exam in the medical school, I broke a patient's tooth, and my professor had to extract the root before my very eyes. - Here's our Lastochkina! She's also a dentist. - Hello! Our whole team is here now. We've been waiting for you! I've been telling them how I broke the root. It was a young girl and she didn't dare to cry, her tears were rolling down but she kept quiet. I should've forgotten all this and just try to be more careful. But I couldn't forget and I was afraid to appoach the dentist's chair, I was afraid to cause pain or even to watch teeth being pulled. This is our Masha, She writes poetry, puts it to music she plays guitar and sings. Let Mom ban us from dinner, let a new movie come to the theaters, let it be Torpedo, let it be Dynamo we don?t care which Dynamo it is. Fly, fly away never mind the ravine on your way your car has an engine and wings Fly! 4 ditches, 33 holes, 48,000 scared dogs we need to turn right but we rush ahead we rush ahead into a ditch Fly, fly away never mind the ravine on your way your car has an engine and wings Fly! If you?re happy or unhappy if you look gloomily through the window if you?re restless there?s only thing for you to do Fly, fly away never mind the ravine on your way your car has an engine and wings Fly! What kind of songs my daughter sings? How can I explain it? If a stranger sang them in a strange company I'd have been listening again and again I'd have been recalling my life one more line, one more memory and all they say "Live it up!" and try to be happy because you only live once. This is our new dentist! - Dad told me about you. Once I feel brave I'll come over. - I'll be glad. At my graduation, I felt I'd be unable to work. Today I didn't want to go to work. Friends! Wait for us! GREETINGS TO AMATEUR PERFORMERS! We are happy to have teeth! He started to like parties. Someone would inevitably toast to him, he'd get embarrassed but would drink up anyway. Like so many happy people he became absent-minded. He didn't notice that Rubakhin decided to leave the town. Yakov Vasilievich, I'm so glad you've come. Do come in. Yakov Vasilievich, I need your advice. I'm going crazy around so many people. I keep mixing them up. Today I asked one about his apartment, and he turns out to be not the one with the apartment but the one with twins. People love you and this is natural. And you have to value it. But I do! I'm just not used to it. You see, when people tell compliments right in your face, I don't know what to do - to keep silent and to smile? You should get married, and submit an application for a new apartment. If you don't, it means you don't need it. An apartment would be nice. You should write an application now, while I'm here. Here's a pen, get a piece of paper... It should be addressed to the Chairman of the Town Council Is it true that you're leaving? Didn't I tell you? Keep on writing. Why are you leaving? Is it really better in Kineshma? Yes. Well, what were you going to write? "I'm asking you to give me an apartment in your town because I need to..." Now Rubakhin is gone... He left at night without telling anyone. He'd lived in this town for 40 years. The poor old man was forced to leave. What happened? Who forced him? Don't you know? How wonderful... Honestly, I don't know. I thought that it was more convenient for him. Why shouldn't I believe him? Then it's alright. You're a smart one. What's the matter? Really, it's OK to do something despicable, but it's not OK to tell someone like it is. Let's start working. Who's next? I'm waiting for Dr. Chesnokov. Who's next? I'm also waiting for him. There's a line outside. We have to do something. Sure. I'm shivering, I must be getting sick. Please. I didn't feel anything. For two months... Thank you. How is it going, Lyudmila Ivanovna? Maybe I'm being unfair. I'm probably going to leave the town like Rubakhin did. Why do you say this? We won't be able to work together. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, Sergei Petrovich. Hi, Sergei Petrovich. Lyudmila Ivanovna, is it true that you're leaving? I heard the rumors that you're leaving. Hi. - Can I have the hammer? - Sorry. You shouldn't be leaving... What does it matter? Lyudmila Ivanovna! I'm begging you, please, don't leave. Why are you following me? I know you don't like me. Keep your voice down. People will hear you. You think I'm smug but it's not true. You think I took this whole Rubakhin thing easily? I just decided not to dwell on it. Otherwise I'd have eaten myself alive. Bon appetit! Hi, Sergei Petrovich! Why do you care if I don't like you? So many people like you, one person doesn't matter. Tell me why, I want to deal with my shortcomings. I don't like people who stir bad feelings in me. Lastochkina is a dangerous lady. She's a schemer. We need to neutralize her. Lyudmila Ivanovna, Kotikov's here. Greetings! Do you know who asked me to call you? Take a guess. No, it was Sergei Petrovich. He's standing on his knees in front of me, and begging me to convince you to stay. What? She's hung up. Damn her. You have to learn not to pay attention to your enemies. Yes. This is Kotikov. We did request it. Lastochkina is leaving us. Why? It didn't work out between her and Chesnokov. It happens. Whose fault is it? It's not Chesnokov's fault, he's a quiet man. What? Why did Rubakhin leave? He had his own reasons. There was something. What? I'll talk to him. He has something to think about until he scares everyone away. What? This makes sense. We're also concerned about it. It's a strange situation... everyone goes to Chesnokov to pull their teeth and ignores other dentists. You know what it leads to? The percentage of existing teeth has been decreasing lately, and not just in our town but in some other towns in the region. We have to think about that. What? It's true. It creates an unnecessary publicity for us. That's it. Agreed. - May I come in? - Masha! Come in. At last, I'm here. Let's see what's wrong. Open. I see. Well, now we're going to... This is a regional commission, they wanted to meet you. Lipkin. Serova. Rudenko. Nikonov. Go on, we don't want to interrupt. Well, Which tooth is bothering you, this one? Periostitis retromolaris. It's nothing serious but you'd better go to the regional clinic. I can't go there now. I'd rather have it pulled now. It's an unnecessary risk. You'd better have an X-ray and surgery over there. Sergei Petrovich, my personal life depends on it. I can't. Sergei Petrovich, I beg you. Please. Masha, I can't do it here. I can't. Ask them. May I take a look? Periostitis retromolaris. May I? Yes, Periostitis retromolaris. Young lady, you can't blame the dentist, his diagnosis is right. Go there for one day. You'll be back in no time and will be able to crack nuts. Very glad to have met you. Goodbye. All the best. Goodbye. - All the best. - Thank you. How did we do? Congratulations! You made a good impression. It's strange, our Sergei chickened out. He didn't dare to pull the tooth. It's wasn't a diffucult case. It's strange. What happened? We all look up to Chesnokov but he has his limits too. What is it? We'll leave Chesnokov for now and will go back two weeks ago. because this case not only affected him but also my daughter Masha. Long live May Day! Who's your date? Vera? No. Katya? No. Are you in a bad mood? It'll pass. I thought that men can't be unhappy. I thought it was women's thing. Not really. How nice it is! Then sing I?m so merry, I?m so cute, I?m so merry There?s no particular reason, the world without songs is bland Don?t be sad, my dear friend, you'd better sing along with me, come on, don?t be sad, forget your worries, just sing and all is gone. My wife tells me all day long: ?Why are you so merry, my dear, why are you so merry?? She always interrups my singing: "Is the world really bland without songs?" Don?t be sad, my dear friend, you'd better sing along with me, come on, don?t be sad, forget your worries, just sing and all is gone. A donkey, a rooster, everyone sings: "The world is bland without songs!" And I'm singing for two, I'm so merry, I'm so cute, Don't be sad, my dear friend, you'd better sing along with me, come on, don?t be sad, forget your worries, just sing and all is gone. Sing even if you got no talent, no voice, and until they?ve figured it out, all the neighbors will run away, only the cats will be listening by the window. just sing the best you can. Amazing! It's really amazing. I can imitate any animal. Which one do you want? A marabou. Perfect. I can do inanimate objects, too. Name it. A toll bar. I'll be damned! And he told her about his trouble. He had a girlfriend and they went to the marriage bureau and submitted the application forms. And a week later, his fiancee realized that she was in love with someone else. On the day of the wedding ceremony, she didn't show up. Dad! I'm getting married. Hello. We want to get married. Very good. Do you have your passports with you? Yes. Fill in the application forms next door. Very good. We give you time to ponder your decision. Come on Wednesday, the 17th. You have to see Chesnokov. Where's Masha? She isn't in. She had a toothache and Chesnokov sent her to the regional clinic. - What happened? - Nothing, it was just a toothache. - Today's Wednesday. - What about it? Today we're supposed to get married. It's Wednesday. Thursday would be just as good. Thursday? Oh, I get it... After the rain on Thursday meaning "never"? Hi. I'm your longtime fan. But it's not why I came. - What are these bastards cooking up? - What bastards? - Don't you know? - No. They spread the rumor you got scared and refused to pull a tooth. It figures. I'm surprised they didn't act earlier. How could they tolerate anything out of ordinary in our town? Don't worry. Don't worry. Tomorrow I'll send you a man with a toothache. I'll come with him. We need witnesses. Have a good rest. We need to end those rumors! Hi, we're going to see Chesnokov. Some bastards are spreading rumors about him. We have to fight back. It's a tough case. Come with us, we need witnesses. We're late for school. You'll make it. Over here. Hi. Here's the man I told you about. Come in. Cloose the door. Sure. That tooth is obsolete. Let's deal with it... What's going on? Chesnokov's at work. It's a tough case. Quiet! - It hurts! - No, it doesn't. It's over. How are you? Everything's fine? There are no miracles. You see what they're doing? They exploit the situation. His gum ached so he went the clinic. I advised him not to go but he did. So he ended up with Lastochkina. She promptly called an outside expert, supposedly for an advice. But, in fact, she denounced you. You see what they're doing? Yes. But we decided that he'd say that your surgery was fine and he has nothing against you. Right? Sergei Petrovich, you'll have to fix his dental problem. We have no time to lose. Get up! I'm sick, I can't. What is it? It's our ruse. What ruse? Leave me alone. I'm sick. What is it? Are you surrendering? You want to keep low profile. So they've tamed you too. So they've won again. I'm not at war with anyone, only with myself. OK. I wouldn't go on a secret mission with you. I wouldn't go with you either. What is it? Did you complain about two teeth? No, one. What was he thinking? I wonder what he recorded. He pulled the 6th instead of the 7th. And his record says the 5th. So, shall we begin? Don't get up, Seryozha. It's a funny situation. Some want me to work miracles, others try to get me for this, they set traps... You're exaggerating. My high spirit is gone. I need to be in a good mood, otherwise I can't do anything. Remake me, change all inside me, I'd be grateful. You're a lucky man. You can do something that nobody else can. Isn't it enough for you? I can't. Seryozha, imagine someone has a toothache, spends sleepless nights, and you can't help him... You can't because you don't want to, or you don't want to because you can't. Let's figure it out. Meanwhile that poor soul would still have a toothache and keep on waiting. Hello! What's going on? Seryozha! You've really come here! Why? Tanya decided to visit you, I decided to go with her, Mom decided to join me, and Kolya had nothing left but to join Mom. That's wonderful... Hi Tanya. So you're here too? I won't be long. I just got a stipend and decided to use it. I'll stay at the Farmers Hostel. Well, how are you? Bad. I'll make it good. Do you have glasses? Glasses? I have two. - I don't drink. - Here. Me neither. Good... Pyotr! He needs a drink. Alcohol is poison. - Keep quiet. - We have to fight that vice. Of course, drinking is bad and Dad doesn't like it himself. But Seryozha needs a drink just to cheer him up. Everyone has an excuse. Seryozha, We know about all your details, and your bad mood... How do you know? You scared me and I went for an advice. You're confused. It's irrelevant. Why are you that impressionable? Look at Mother, she went through the war, gave birth twice, travels with me around the country. Look at her, she ought to be in movies. That's who you should learn from. You lack optimism. Here's to you. Drink up! - Enough! - Does he have to drink it all? Drink up! Everyone faces difficulties, you have to overcome them. Look at Father. No matter how hard it was, he never gave in. You should follow his example. Seryozha, forgive me. If you don't, I'll leave right now. Do you want me to leave? Seryozha... He's asleep. Oh, my God... Wartime childhood is the cause of it. He's unhappy because I came. I shouldn't have shown his letters. What? Sleepyhead! Rise up, all the people of good will... Are you angry at me? You're right. Let's play. Let's play. - Your queen is under threat. - Don't tip him! - It doesn't count. - New rules? He didn't notice. I surrender. Maybe you want to go for a walk? It will do you good. And take Tanya along. Maybe he wants to go alone... I'll be a burden. What do you mean? Go with him, it's more fun. I know I shouldn't have come. When we're apart, you imagine that you really love me. And when I'm here, you're disappointed. Please, don't accuse me of anything now. I don't. You look like I've offended you. No. You're in a bad mood. And you? I have my reasons. I have my reasons too. I'm always dependent on your mood, and your mood is tied to your work. And I don't matter. So I'm supposed to be cheerful? OK, ha ha ha. - You don't have to be. - Then I don't understand what you want. - Nothing. - It's not true. Don't yell. I see you're in a mood for a fight. Let's not do it now, some other time. What's the matter? I can't hear you. Seryozha, do something to make us happy, please. We overpraised Chesnokov, we have to admit it. The man himself! Come in to find out what people are saying about you. Now he allows himself to leave in the middle of the day. Now imagine what would happen if any of us would do it, especially the newcomers. The result of it is obvious - He pulled the wrong tooth and didn't even record it properly. Excuse me... How did you get in here? I've come to say that I personally have nothing against Chesnokov. I'd also like to thank Dr. Lastochkina for the excellent job she did on me. Don't mention it. Maybe we should give a word to our celebrity? Maybe he'd like to answer to some of our criticism? Let him tell us how he's come to all this? Sergei Petrovich! How did you manage to do it? The wrong tooth is a scandal... At least, you could have recorded one or the other, we could have explained it... but you recorded a totally different one I'm asking for an unpaid vacation. A vacation? It might be a good idea. I think you're overstressed. Have a rest and everything will be OK. Back then I lived close to him, witnessed his ups and downs and now I get to the pages of his life that I don't like to recall. He quit the clinic. - Dorodny. - Here. - Zavalnyuk. - Here. - Karpova. - Here. Linkova. - Chernousova. - Here. Stand up when you answer. - Chushko. - Here. Close the door. Let her in. She's a YCL organizer. She has to come on time. Please, Zavalnyuk... Close your notebooks. Teething. We talked about the anomalies of teething. Close the door. He lives out of town. He has to allow more time to travel. OK, Zavalnyuk. Sit down. Where did we stop last time? We stopped at the phrase "radical surgical." OK, continue writing: "Surgical interference... in this case... in this case... is only applied when..." When? Let's finish the sentence! It's a long sentence. We'll finish it tomorrow. My respects. - How are you? - Fine. - How is work? - Great. That's it. The horse got tired of the steep hills. Seryozha! - Are you OK? - I'm fine. - Where are you going? - Let's go sunbathing to the riverside. - I have no time. - You have to take a break. Let's go skiing. - Some other time. It might be too late then. Such days are few. Sergei Petrovich! Behave yourself. The main thing is not to depend on what people say. If you depend on it too much get away from these people as quickly as you can. Are you talking to me? I'm speaking in general. But if you want to use it, help yourself. Hi. It's been a while. At the time, we rarely met. He preferred casual acquaintances because friendship implies obligations. Why has he come tonight? How have you been? Not bad. How about you? I'm fine. If you wanted to see a happy man, here I am. I've decided to write a "how to" guide. Keep your voice down. Masha is sleeping. First, I stopped fretting, I used to pay attention to every worry, and now I don't have them anymore. I envy you. You want to learn how? I'd be glad. Only keep your voice down. There are many ways, it's all inside of us. For example, look at the street... I'm looking. Imagine this is another town, and the people there don't know you... It changes everything. You've left all your worries in the previous town, it's all forgotten. If it really makes you happy... I'm glad. I'm really happy. Masha! You're looking at me as if you're deciding if you should roast me alive or chop me and put me into a salad. OK, let's not dwell on it. What about your songs, have you written anything lately? No. Why? People want songs. There won't be any more songs. No, Masha! I need to talk to you. Don't bother, let her go. She's in a bad mood. That's my specialty, I'll take care of it. Do you want to talk to me? OK. My merry man, I'd like to remind you of a case from your practice. You remember how you refused to pull my tooth and sent me away? It was complicated - a commission was there. A commission? That explains it. Where is it located? It was a temporary commission. It's not located anywhere. Where should I address my complaint? What complaint? It's about two lives having been ruined as the result of all this. It just happened that way. Two human lives. I don't get it. And it was just a temporary commission. At least, it could have been a permanent one. Masha! Calm down. What's the matter? I can't be responsible for all the teeth in the world. I want to sleep. Wait! You're accusing me for no reason. I need to explain. - Later. Later, Sergei Petrovich. We'll talk about it separately. I didn't warn you. I just received my paycheck and decided to come. Something's happened? Yes. You don't want to talk about it? Did someone hurt you? No. Did you hurt someone? Yes. I'm sinking. I'm sinking. Let's not stay here. Let's go home. Where's the register? I forgot it. It's OK. Name all the kinds of toothache. Neuralgic pain, pain caused by pulpitis Pulpitis causes an awful pain... It lasts few minutes but occurs every 2 or 3 hours. It's especially strong at night when one lies down. Sit down. Don't write down anything. What other kinds of toothache you know? Permanent pain, nagging pain, throbbing pain, Toothache causes both physical and mental suffering. When one has a toothache, it seems like something mysterious and dreadful. If you complain to someone about your toothache, that person will likely tell you that he had a much stronger ache than yours. "When fevers burn, or ague freezes, Rheumatics gnaw, or colic squeezes, Our neighbor's sympathy can ease us, Wi' pitying moan; But thee - thou hell o' a' diseases, Aye mocks our groan." It's a humorous poem... but the ancient Romans wrote their scientific treatises in verse because they understood that science and art are inseparable. Are you bored? No. Wait. We could have ended our story here if it weren't complicated by a dramatic event. One of my students fell from a tree and broke his teeth. The only person able to do a quick and painless surgery was Chesnokov. I can't. I don't practice anymore. Don't worry, Sergei Petrovich. Why would you risk your reputation? I'm not worried about that. I really can't. You can't take revenge on the whole medical science. It's not a revenge. I just can't. I can't. How do you teach students then? If you can't do it yourself, what can you teach them? I'm a bad teacher. Don't jump to conclusions. He has his reasons. I can't forgive a man who refuses to perform his medical duty. What if he really can't? If he forgot how to do it? In that case, how can he teach others? It's a regional commission. They'd like to get to know you better. Get the fence up. We'll have a break. What do you have here? Plasticine. Plasticine? What for? To sculpt. To sculpt? Do you have classes today? I have a practical class. It sounds very interesting. Why are you so interested in me? What's the matter? Our working conditions are poor. I want to mention it. We can't get any patients unless we have an agreement with the clinic. One of our students needs her tooth to be pulled so we'll use her but it's not the solution. Let's get to it. The classes started 10 minutes ago. Let's go. Did you anesthetize her? Yes. It's a clear case - extraction of a lower right molar. It's more difficult comparing to the other teeth. What's the dentist's position? Zavalnyuk? The dentist? The dentist is positioned on the right, slightly behind the patient. Proceed, Zavalnyuk. It's a difficult tooth. It doesn't move. What do you mean? Apply the pliers. - Done. - Move it forward. - Done. - Now squeeze. Look! It's maddening. Zavalnyuk, concentrate. Don't yell. What are you doing? Help her. Don't just stand by. She has to do it herself. Sergei Petrovich. Stop it. You're a doctor. I can't. I don't practice anymore. Are you worried about your reputation? No, I'm not. I really can't. How can you teach students then? Let me. She needs more novocaine. You think so? Hello? Tosya? Run to Grandma, tell her to come to our medical school. Chesnokov is pulling teeth here. Leave the room, please! Leave the room! I see. Rise the chair so the patient's tooth would be leveled with your shoulder. Keep you fingers like this. It makes it more convenient to move the pliers. Sergei Petrovich, may I? What is it? Just once, please. OK, Karpova. What about you? I'll be right here. That's it. What about my tooth? Here it is. Someone managed to capture that scene, and luckily I still have that photo. You can clearly see Karpova, shouting "Here it is!" You can see Lastochkina looking at Karpova with a forced smile, and Chesnokov, who was also looking at Karpova with awe and pride, and also with premonition of what she might face in her future life. And now again, flying in the sky, the moon shines counting the waves. And now again, it can?t tell how many waves were in the sea and how many are left. It looks like the wave has become itself again - just a wave in the sea.
