14 years had passed since my adventures on the notorious Treasure Island and since I last clapped eyes on Long John Silver. Where he wound up after escaping from the Hispaniola, I never did hear. Wherever it was, I'm sure he's still up to his old tricks. As for me, I struck out for a British colony in America to make my fortune, little knowing what fate had in store for a one-time cabin boy turned merchant adventurer. Come on boy, come on! Hey, come on! Walk on, boy. Good boy, walk on, boy. Good boy, walk on. He's getting away, he's getting away! Whoa, Tom, whoa! What is it, Patch? What is it, boy? Stand. All right, come out, real slow. Please, master, have mercy, master, they'll kill me! They'll kill me! All right, get down, get down! No, no, no, get down! Good day to you, sirs. Have you seen a runaway slave boy? Well, plenty in my time but none today. If I see him, would you like me to use this? Or would you like him alive? It makes no difference, we'll string him up anyhow. The Lord bless you, master. It'd be the first time in years. Come on, get yourself down. I'd be grateful if I could hitch a ride for a little while, master. You want me swinging from a rope as well? No, master, but... - Damn it, boy, you know helping a runaway slave is a hanging offense! And I'm in too much debt to die. So you get yourself away. Uh, and you better wash that cut before it goes bad. Thank you, master, thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Christmas was the last thing on my mind. I'd come a long way since making my home in South Carolina. I missed old England and I knew one day I'd return there, to my own country. But the rumblings of the trade dispute between Britain and its richest colony America was to bring an unexpected turn to my ambitions and set me on a course of events that threatened an end to all my dreams. Heave! Heave! That's it. Good boy, walk on. Good boy. Good boy, Tom, walk on. Whoa! Whoa. Walk on, Tom. Good boy, good boy, Tom. Walk on, Tom. Here, come on. Come on. Whoa, boy, good boy. Jenkins? Aye, sir. What happened? Sit down, man! Sit down. You should be halfway to Spain. Tell that to the British, Mr. Hawkins. They took the ship, Jim. The Hawk? Gone? Seized, five days since. British man-of-war. The Sea Wolf, sir. Hey now! - All right. Heave! They put us in a longboat, said row. Why? Proclamation from King George. All American ships are forfeit. But we're British! I told that to the officer. Said my master's no rebel, he's loyal to the king. He laughed, said that he won't mind giving His Majesty the ship then, will he? You're done here, man, go get some food, get some rest. Aye, sir, thank you, sir. I'm sorry, sir, she was just too fast for us. Whoa there, sir! Three ships in a year. There's talk of a blockade. Where? Every harbor. Then we must sail tonight. Tonight? It's Christmas Eve, Jim, we've only half a crew! Tom, this ship and its cargo stand between me and the poorhouse. We sail on the midnight tide, crew or no crew. Catch me! - I'll get you, I'll get you! Mind he don't take your fingers. The cargo is in your warehouse. I must return to my ship. To rob some more unsuspecting traders, Mr. Savage? At the command of my king, sir. I'm not a pirate. Well, thank King George for me when you sees him. Always a pleasure to do business with a gentleman. I'll wager not a silver reaches King George's sticky hands, pirate or not. Miss Silver! Mr. Savage, I had no idea you were here. I had business with your father. Are you not staying for tea? Alas no, duty calls. I wish I could go to sea. Rose, run along and fetch Mr. Savage a bottle of our Chirstmas wine. I'm sure Father didn't think to offer. I wish I could fight those American rebels. I, on the other hand, would much rather stay here and to play games with you. My cousin Rose likes company of her own age. Tell me, Miss Silver, would you run as fast if I was chasing you? Only 'til I had caught you, Mr. Savage. I see, you are your father's daughter. Yes, and my mother's sir. And indeed your mother's, she, too, was very beautiful. It's not fair! Why can't girls drink and fight? Thank you. With this wind, we should be clear of the Indies by nightfall. We need to be, the sea's crawling with British. We're flying the Jack. So was the Hawk, Tom. Aye, lads. You always feel like sailing after a drop of this. Down the hatch! That's sweet as mother's milk! Isn't it, lads? - Aye! Help! Patch! No, no! - Let go! Let go! What the devil? Why, it is a devil, sir, he stowed away on board! Hold! Release him, Mr. Pearce. Please, master, have mercy, master! You! I told you, didn't I? I don't harbor slaves. Yes, master, but... - I have a good mind to let them feed you to the sharks! I can work, master, I'm strong. I know you're shorthanded. Please, master, I'm a good sailor! You can work 'til we reach our destination, but as a slave, mind, there's no pay. Yes, master, thank you, master! Don't thank me! As soon as we reach land, I'll hand you over to the law. I don't steal slaves. What's your name, lad? Jonah. You best not let the rest of the crew know that. You know what happened to the real Jonah? Coral? Mm-hmm? Why did you show Mr. Savage Aunt Cleo's picture? Because he wanted to see it. Can I? Oh, Rose, you've seen it a hundred times. I like to look. I don't remember her. Coral. Yes, Rose? Would you do what Aunt Cleo did to marry Mr. Savage? Rose! Hold that mast aloft! She's a rebel trader, all right. Put on full sail, Mr. Lamb, we'll intercept and board her. Aye-aye, sir! Hoist the main sail, all hands on deck, on the double! Heave! Heave! Heave! There she is, Mr. Hawkins, the Sea Wolf. The same blackguard that seized the Hawk. Can we out run her, Tom? If the Hawk couldn't, we have no chance, Jim. She's trying to outrun us. Aye, but we're reeling her in. I think she suspects who we are. Then put a shot across her bow, Mr. Lamb, and leave her in no doubt. Aye, sir. Mr. Ingram, Mr. Bates, load swivel gun. - Ready! - Aim! She's firing! Take cover! Fire! All right, all hands back on deck again, lads. Aye, sir. Go on, look sharp! We're gonna shift the sail, come on. It's just a warning shot. But if we don't heave to, the next one won't be, Mr. Hawkins. Do we fight them? No, Tom, they outgun us. That's a lively squall ahead, Jim. Then let's see what they're made of! Hard a-starboard, Mr. Gavor! Hard a-starboard is it, sir! She's getting into the storm with full sails, sir! Then her master's either a fool or a madman, mister. Veer away! Aye, sir! We'll let the store deal with them. I have you, John Silver! After all these years, I have you at last! Maybe you has, Jack Feathers. Oh yes, I have this time! This time! And maybe you ain't. You damned and blasted cheating devil! You owe me, you own me, John Silver and by thunder I'll get it! Hold, Jack, hold! Get off me, get off me! Father, let him go! It was just a lark. It was all fun, eh? You get out of this house and never come back! Now hold, hold, girl, hold! Out! And take your lackeys here with you. He be shipmates, John Silver's right hand! He is a drunken, vulgar beast! Now, hold girl! No, he be the beast! Leaving me to rot on that island. Me hands was tied, matey, I was a prisoner meself! No! 'Twas you who betrayed us and left good men dead and rotting where they fell! A curse on you, John Silver! A curse on you! He be a shipmate, girl, the last of me crew! Father, he is a drunken, lying thief! You be too harsh at times, girl. Takes after me, not your poor mother, God rest her soul. Get below! Mr. McNab! There's nothing we can do, Jim, get below! You raise that anchor, Mr. Deckard! The storm could've blown us anywhere. We need to rest up, repair the damage. I'll go ashore and see if I can get our bearings. Be careful, Jim. Wherever we are, it'll be British. So am I, Tom, so am I. Having survived the storm, here was I, a loyal English trader, chased and harried on the high seas by a British man-of-war. No one knew when the conflict would end, but I was determined to save the Eagle, the sole survivor of the fleet I had worked so hard to build. Few could have foreseen the events which lay ahead and which were destined to change the course of my life forever. Coral! Look, you can hear the sea! Can you? Let me hear. You can! I think I hear something else, listen! Go, boy! Ben, get the bracelet! Unhand them, scum! No! Are you all right? Are you hurt, mistress? No, sir. Thanks to you. Thank you. Oh, look! What have you got, Patch? What is it, boy? Well, that rogue shouldn't be hard to find, provided he's standing up. I don't know how to thank you, sir. By letting me see you both safely home. Uncle John! Father! - Uncle John! We were on the beach and these men and Jack Feathers and they were trying to steal our jewelry! What is it? What's the matter? Looks like you've seen the devil himself, matey. Well, perhaps I have, sir, for only the devil could grow another leg when one was lost. Now who be you, who'd be just a sprat when Long John had but one leg to make his way? John Silver. Long John Silver, as I live and breathe. Never thought I'd see your ugly face again. Coral. You don't recognize me? Your old shipmate from the Hispaniola? What? Jim? Little, little Jim Hawkins? Aye. A trite taller, a little more filled out, but Jim Hawkins just the same. Jim! But how? Oh, had a new leg carved in Kingston, by a master craftsman! No aches or pains, better than the real thing! Hear, if you're after them gold sovereigns I took, they be spent long since! What strange twist of fate was this? To meet the most beautiful creature I'd ever seen, only to find her the daughter of my old enemy, one of the most feared men who ever roamed the Spanish Main. Old Long John Silver. Now a gentleman with servants and a country estate! Well, they'll not get far and when I catches that Jack Feathers, I'll have his eye for that there chair! How fortunes change, but had he? Ah, Captain Flint! Aye, the very same. Outlive us all, old Flint. A drink, Jim! You've invested your gold sovereigns well it seems, Long John. Aye, them and others. But I be a respectable gent now, Jim, there's talk of making me a magistrate. You? You must still be wanted in England for mutiny! Mutiny, Uncle John? Oh, a little misunderstanding, Rose, that's all that be. A toast, Jim, to old shipmates, well-met and hardy yet! And to new acquaintances. Aye. Mm, I must reward you handsome for saving me Coral and little Rose! Oh, there's no question of reward, sir. Oh, but Jim... I merely did what any gentleman would do. Would've done twice as much for someone half as fair. They be all I got since my Cleo passed away. She was my mother. Aunt Cleo was named after an Egyptian queen. Aye. And queen she was. My wife Cleo was a slave, Jim. She was a queen, a queen in her own country far off, like Cleopatra in Egypt! 'Til they ripped her away and locked her in chains. My Egypt. Dark and mysterious Cleopatra. I called her that, Cleopatra. Couldn't pronounce her real name. I always knew you'd make a fine gentleman one day, Jim. What line you in? Mr. Hawkins has a ship! A ship, you say? Aye, a trader, the Eagle. And, um, I must get back to her. Nay, you'll stay for dinner, Jim! I can't, alas, my friends'll be anxious for me! Then we'll take you to her and we'll invite 'em all to sup! To you, Jim. It's the Sea Wolf. She hasn't spotted us yet. We hang around until she does, it'll be too late. Weigh anchor, Mr. Jenkins. We can't leave Mr. Hawkins. He wouldn't thank us for handing his last ship to the British on a plate. Boy! Yes, master? Can I trust you? Yes, Captain. So when my mother died I sold the inn and I... Made your fortune in America! Aye, I will yet, Long John, when this silly squabble with King George is over. What is America like, Mr. Hawkins? America is a land of infinite variety and opportunity, the jewel in England's crown. You must visit, Miss Silver. You must invite me, Mr. Hawkins. She's gone! You sure this be the bay? Aye, positive. It looks like you've lost a ship, matey. Master, master! Jonah, where's the Eagle? She had to run from a British ship, master. Mr. Thomas say to give you this. Run from the British? We sailed out of America, Long John. Oh. You best come home with me, you'll be safe there until you're reunited with your ship. Jonah, keep an eye on Patch. Yes, master. Patch, come on! Hello. Mistress? Are you a friend of Mr. Hawkins? A friend? No, I'm his cabin boy, mistress. That's exciting, I want to go to sea. What's your name? Jonah, mistress. Don't call me a mistress. I'm Rose. How do you do, Jonah? But you're not a rebel are you, Mr. Hawkins? No, I'm a loyal subject of King George. Then you have nothing to fear. Mistress Coral, the British attack every boat out of America, loyal or not. Surely not! I've had three cargoes seized in the past 18 months. Three? Aye. Then we must talk to Mr. Savage. Father? Ah, well... Who is Mr. Savage? He's a friend, a British naval officer. I'm sure he'll help you when he returns. Oh, where is he now? On his ship, the Sea Wolf. It felt like I had walked straight into the lion's den, but what a change the love of a woman can wrought in old John Silver. Who'd have thought a slave would teach this ruffian gentleness and affection? Or so it seemed the way he stroked the urn that held her ashes, the last surviving relic of his departed love. But if she gave birth and raised the gentle Coral, then surely she must've been a queen, be her black or no. He saved your life? Aye, on Treasure Island. Jack Feathers and the rest were gonna string me up. Has he never told you that? He never talks about his past, except about my mother. She died five years ago of a fever. I sometimes think my father will never get over it. Do you think that's possible, Mr. Hawkins? To love someone so much as to never recover from losing them? Oh yes, I believe that. Absolutely. Poor Father. Ah, two up and across. Mr. Hawkins, why do the American rebels fight the British? They don't like British taxes, they don't like the goods and their ships being seized. But your ships are being seized and you're not a rebel, are you? No, I don't think brother should fight brother, I think we should talk. I think you should talk to Mr. Savage. No, that wouldn't be any use. You're contradicting yourself! I'm sure he would help you, I know he would for me. So would any man. I mean especially for me. I see. Good dog, Patch! Jonah, what's it like being a slave? Like? Well, you ain't free. But what does it feel like? Like being an animal, I guess. Are yourmother and father slaves? They're dead. You're an orphan, like me. Not quite like you. Mr. Savage, how fortune. Miss Silver, please excuse my interruption but I have an urgent message for you father. He's not here at present, but this is Mr. Jim Hawkins. Pleased to meet you sir. Mr. Hawkins just sailed his ship from America. Uh, Miss Silver, it is imperative that I speak to your father immediately. He's not here, he's shooting in the woods. Then I shall have to go and find him. Miss Silver, when next we meet I do hope it is under better circumstances. Good day to you both. What can he mean by under better circumstances? Good day, Mr. Silver. Top of the mornin' to ya. A word, if I may. Off you go, lad. My congratulations, sir. For what? Come Silver, modesty's not your style. You have the advantage of me, Mr. Savage. Luring a rebel shipowner to your very home. He's an old friend of mine, a shipmate from way back. I heard John Silver would sell his mother for the right price. Nay, not this time, not Jim Hawkins. He saved my Coral's life not two days since! I need only to know when the ship is due to pick him up. There's money and the right to buy his forfeit cargo, as usual. I take that right friendly, Mr. Savage, but not this time, thank you very much, not Jim Hawkins. I gave him my word. The word of a murdering pirate who still keeps half the buccaneers in the Indies supplied with money? Aye, including your good self, Mr. Savage. And who do you think a British court will choose to believe, Mr. Silver? The word of a British officer and a gentleman or the lies of a villain who's still wanted in England for mutiny and for murder? You will help me in this, John Silver, or by heaven your daughter and your niece will be orphans before this month is out! Coral! Coral! Father? Father, whatever is the matter? Mr. Savage was here looking for you! Oh, he found me, by thunder! What is it? You look pale. It's all up, lass, it's all up with Long John. What? The British have issued a warrant for my arrest! A warrant, what for? Piracy, mutiny, murder! But that's ridiculous, they can't do that! They can and they have! Savage is tryin' to stall them as long as he can but if I don't get off this island soon... What, leave? Aye, before the dragoons arrive! But Father, you can't leave without us! I'll find a safe haven and I'll send for ya! No! If you're going, Rose and I are coming with you. I won't leave you to fight this alone. You can only take what you's stands up in. no trunks full of fancy dresses. They've got spies out watchin' our every move! Then how are we to escape? If we got to the harbor... No, we can't go to the harbor, we need to find a ship somehow! Mr. Hawkins, you have a ship. You can't ask Jim to help a fugitive from the king, that be treason. Mr. Hawkins? He's in enough trouble without taking pity on three poor runaways, ain't that right? Aye, that's very true. So a little more trouble will hardly be noticed, will it? All shipshape? We must hurry. Then let's go, shipmates. - Jim... - I'll explain later, Tom! Get ready to make weigh. What the blazes? Ahoy, the Eagle, this is His Majesty's Ship the Sea Wolf! You are under arrest! Make weigh, Tom! Weigh anchor. No, stop, it's Captain Savage, he won't hurt you. Ahoy, the Eagle, heave to! Pearce, get these people below! Aye, sir! Jim, wait! There's no need to run. Get her below, Mr. Pearce. This way, miss. Coral, come. We'll never make it, Jim. Head for the sandbar. What? The tide's near full, we must draw less than the Sea Wolf. But if we get stuck... Then we're no worse off! Get ready to make headway, Tom. She's running, sir. Shall I put a ball into her? No, Mr. Lamb, Silver and his daughter are still on board. Run her down. Aye, sir. Steady she goes. Approaching the sandbar now, sir! Hold her steady. Fools, they can't escape us! We've grounded! She's free, Mr. Hawkins! She's free! Sir! Hard a-bow, Mr. Lamb! The Sea Wolf's grounded! We made it! We made it. As morning came, we were sailing fast and free but we had escaped more by luck than judgment and it was by no means certain that we were out of danger yet. I spent a troubled night plagued by old thoughts about John Silver, his trickery, his lies, his ruthlessness. How did the Sea Wolf come upon us in the dark? Was that their good luck or had they had a helping hand? Me? Tip off the British? Betray me old shipmate? Jim Hawkins... The old Silver wouldn't have thought twice. I be hurt. I be truly hurt. You thinks that badly of old Long John. You foolish man! Mr. Savage would've protected us all. Why did you run? Now you are a rebel and you deserve to be caught. I demand to be put off at the nearest port. Well, you're free to leave whenever you please, provided you can swim. Jim. I thanks you. For saving old Long John's hide. I owe you again. John, I've known you play both sides against the middle before, I'll be watching you. Jonah, I'm bored, come and play! I can't, Miss Rose, I've got to work. We've only an hour's start of them at most, we can't outrun 'em. No, but we could change course. Where to? There's no friendly port within days. Go about, straight into the wind and current. Turn back? Aye, they wouldn't be expecting that, won't be looking where we are. How can he be so stupid? How dare he abduct us! Oh, hold, girl. We did ask Jim for his help. Not to run away from Mr. Savage, Father. He's a friend. Well, we can all make mistakes knowing who your friends be. I hope he does get caught. I hope Mr. Savage catches us and claps him in irons. He won't we've changed course. What? We're going against the current he said. Against it? Hey, Patch, come back, Patch! Oy, missy, no running! No running, missy! Rose, Rose, not on the bridge, leave him! I hope you took the jewels out first. Jonah! Yes, Miss Rose? What are those huge fish? Porpoises! Are they dangerous? No, they say they're quite friendly. Been known to save men from drowning. Don't! Oh, I'm telling he dived down! Stop that! - Hey! Stop that you horrid man! - Hey! Hey! Let go of me! You've not to shoot them, you've not to! Aye? Who says, young missy? I do! You get your hands off her! Rose. Oh, Mr. Pearce. If you so much as even look at her again or even think about shooting a porpoise, I'll have you keelhauled. If she was on this course we would've sighted her by now. If Silver's on their side, watch out for trickery, Mr. Savage. Ahoy, object on starboard bow, quarter mile starboard. He was very kind, he stopped that horrid man and scolded him. I like him, I don't think he's a rebel. What would you know? You liked him once, better than Mr. Savage. I did not! You did! You're being foolish! Oh, good girl. I tell ya, that'd never happened with old Flint. Nor Billy Bones, neither, damned his soul. Humiliate you afore your shipmates. You sailed with Flint? As quartermaster. You be Long John Silver? Your deadlights are lookin' straight at 'im. And I'll tell you straight, you wouldn't have been made a fool of on my ship. By a sprat of a girl, too, I bargain. I heard tell she was your niece. Niece of no, he had no right to treat a grown man like a baby. Terrible, terrible thing to see. I was within half an inch... Of what? Hear, you best not strike the captain unless... Unless you know the others stands behind you. Oh, well I reckon... Aye? They're not his regular crew. Aye? Well, if the time comes. When. Sail ho, sail ho! Maybe sooner than you think, shipmate. Maybe sooner than you think. The Sea Wolf. How? How, Tom? I thought we'd given her the slip! It was me. I dropped a marker with a message. You still have time to turn around and give yourself up as a loyal subject. I'm sure Mr. Savage... Clap her in irons! You'll have her boarded before dinner, sir. We're outgunned and we're outmanned, Tom. I don't know how many of the crew have the stomach for a fight. We'll not fight! We're a lost. God. You've come to crow, Silver? You put her up to that, I'll wager. Nah, she done that of her own accord. Takes after her mother, God rest her soul. What do you want? Beggin' your pardon, sir, but I sees you two gentlemen in a brown study, so to speak, hangdog like a couple of beaten curs. By heaven, I will strike you where you stand! Hold, hold Jim, lad, your old shipmate's come to help you out, if you've a mind to listen. Well? They're too fast and they outgun us, so we can't fight 'em at sea, that's plain. So where do you suggest, Silver? A mountaintop? Aye! Aye, if you've a mind. A mountaintop and a safe haven to be, right here. But there's nothing! Aye, Jim, lad, Treasure Island. Treasure Island, the very name still threw shivers down my spine. What dreadful deeds had happened there, what men has perished. The sights I'd seen, enough to make a grown man tremble, and give me nightmares until I became a man. Had that nightmare now come back to haunt me? Would that devil's island still claim my life as it had so nearly done many years ago? And what part would Silver and his daughter Coral play? I brought you some food, mistress Coral. I'm not hungry. Mr. Hawkins' orders, miss. Well, you tell Mr. Hawkins if he doesn't release me this minute, I shall have him horsewhipped. Well, go and tell him! Horsewhip is very bad, mistress, very, very bad. Why are you staring? I've never seen a woman in chains before, mistress. At least not a white one. There she be, Jim! As old and ugly as ever. I vowed I'd never set foot on that accursed place again. Aye, Jim, but there's a channel to a safe port and we know every inch of her mangy slopes, Savage don't! Steady she goes, Mr. Gavor. I see no channel! Silver, if you're making sport with us... It's there, matey, trust ol' Long John! Jim! Hard a-port! Hard a-port! Hard a-port, Mr. Gavor! There she goes! Steady as she goes! We made it. We made it! We'll post a double watch all night. Armed? Aye. What about Silver? Confine him to his cabin. And the girl in the hold? Leave her where she is. My mother shot the man who chained her and fed his pieces to his dogs! Patch will keep you company and see after the rats. It wasn't Long John Silver's accordion that kept me awake that night, but thoughts of the woman I had chained like a slave below, the one my soul reached out to while my head yet drove me away. I longed to trust he and win her heart, yet she was her father's daughter, that was sure, and I couldn't trust either of them out of my sight. Alas my love Well, here we be, my lovely, Treasure Island. Not a place I'd bring you willingly. Things happened here I never even told you. Aye, but ye knows, don't ya matey? You knows the tales all right. They're behind that headland, sir, but I can't see a passage through. Heave! Mr. Hawkins, this is futile. You can't win, Mr. Savage will kill you. Not while I have hostages, if he cares for you as much as you say. Mr. Silver. Your leg, sir. Your craftsman-carved leg. I'll have it. But... - In case you've a venture to take a walk. I can take it from you, John. Tom. May God forgive you. Cut him a crutch. Anchor in the lee of those hills, Mr. Lamb. We'll never get a shot at them from out here, sir. But they're trapped. They can't escape us now. Come on, lads! There it is! Ah, there be memories here, eh, Jim lad? Ol' Long John saved your hide on this very spot! Tie him up, Mr. Pearce. Mr. McNab and I will spy out the Sea Wolf. There's no cause of fighting, Jim, we're in this together, side-by-side, like, like old times! Tie him, Mr. Pearce, and watch him. Aye, sir. If he cannot sink us from sea, he means to do it by land. Come on, put some back into it, get going! The way I sees it, shipmates, is there's only one side of this gonna come out the victors, and Long John always likes to be on the winning side. What say you? Aye, I don't know. It's not our ship, we're not rebels! Ah, no more you be, and Mr. Savage, he be a great friend of mine, I'm sure ol' Long John could persuade him to, uh, reward for them that helps take young Hawkins. A reward? Mr. Pearce, the rest of you, we need you! At the double! Jonah. Guard the others. Keep them moving, Mr. Lamb. Heave! Come on, men, put your backs into it! Just down there! Ease it down, men. Keep it moving. Come on! You has a way with you there, Jonah. You could go far! If you weren't a slave, lad. You know what it's like to be chained and tied, eh, Jonah? Aye, but you could be free. Free as that there bird, free to come and go as you please! Aye, free! Long John could buy your freedom if you'd lend him a hand. Jonah, listen to Uncle John, he can free you. You don't have to be a slave anymore! Think about it, Jonah, shouldn't you be free? Mr. Hawkins said to guard you. Make ready to fire! Pack it! Ram it! Ball! Ready? Taper! Hawkins! The wig, Mr. Lamb. The wig! Get them on their feet! Untie him and give him his crutch. Where are you taking us? Though it was 15 years since I last set foot there, the island unfolded before me like the palm of my hand. The memories of my escape, my pursuit by murderous pirates, and my meeting with poor old Ben Gunn were as vivid as if they had been yesterday as was the fear that gripped my very soul. Ben Gunn's old home. Feels like his ghost come back. Or maybe it's you, Jim Hawkins, gone mad as him! Rose. Mr. Jenkins! Mr. Pearce, bring out some food and feed our guests. Aye-aye! Tom, a word. Savage won't be stalled for long, we've got to strike first this time. Where? How? In his heart, the Sea Wolf. They've been here! Mr. Feathers, you know the island, where would they hide? Ah, there's a score of places. Spread out and search. There's 20 gold pieces for the man who finds me Jim Hawkins, dead or alive. Come here! Come here, boy! Here! Fixin' to blow someone up, me hearty? Aye, something. The Sea Wolf. No, is that a fact? I reckon our Mr. Savage would pay handsome to be apprised of that there information and if I were he I'd pitch my headquarters in the Stockade. Here you are. I have you, boy! He's not in there, Jim. He went off after that parrot, Mr. Hawkins. Shall I go find him? Mm-hmm. You will tell me where they are hiding, boy! Tie him up and throw him outside, he'll not talk. Ahoy, ahoy Mr. Savage! No, no! Don't shoot, sir. I be a friend. We'll have to go without them. Jenkins, go to the cave! Let's go. Don't worry, Patch, your master will be back soon. Maybe. Maybe not. Gunpowder be a treacherous friend at times, eh shipmate? If only he hadn't run from Mr. Savage. The black lad run soon enough, didn't expect that. No! Now! Up! Look out, Tom! Damn your eyes! That weren't the ship, must be all up with Hawkins! Won't be long afore Savage blows up the Eagle as well, I reckon! Untie me! Rose, we need help and fast! They may be back and there's no tellin' what they'll do if young Hawkins is gone but you're the only one who's properly mobile, Rose. Are you brave enough to find Mr. Savage if I point you the way? Yes, Uncle John, if I can take Patch with me. Good girl! We'll come on best we can. Down here! Thank God! I thought we were goners! Where's Silver? Patch, Miss Rose! Jonah! What happened? Savage's men caught me, but I didn't tell him where Mr. Hawkins was. Untie me, Miss Rose, please. Um... You're a rebel. No I'm not! But you're on Mr. Hawkins' side! That don't make me a rebel. Yes it does or Mr. Savage wouldn't have tied you up. I can't untie you, Jonah, I'm sorry. But Miss Rose, please! Well, well, well, what have we here? Mr. Savage, I have a message from Uncle John. A likely story. Hold, girl. More haste, less speed. Come on, Father, there's not far to go. Jim, you're alive. Sorry to disappoint you, Miss Silver. What do you think of our guest, Tom? Quitting our hospitality without saying goodbye. Downright discourteous, I'd say! Let's go! Oh, aye, brought me breakfast have ya? They're not for you! Hand 'em over. They're for Jonah! Get your own! What, you'd feed that black swab before me? He isn't a swab and if you don't leave me alone, I'll tell Mr. Savage! And my Uncle John! I've brought you these, you must be hungry. Jonah, Jonah, I'm sorry! But if you'd only... What? Betray Mr. Hawkins? I think, I think he's dead, Jonah. The explosion... He ain't dead, he ain't. Oh, he'll wish he was when Savage catches him! Well, if his lordship won't have 'em. I don't like it, Mr. Savage, we should've met up with them by now. Oh, Mr. Savage, sir, what's that? There's only one man on this island who needs a crutch to walk. Well, come on! The Eagle should be in the next bay, Jim, we're nearly there. Let's go. Get up. Get up! I won't move another step until you take off these irons! And have you run off to your British hero? Get up! Or what, you'll shoot me? Get up! Damn you, get up! Leave her alone or by thunder! No, Father! No one touches my daughter! No! No! She'll be gone! She'll be gone! Help me! Cleo! This way! Hold! Hold him! Father! Damn you! No harm done. Oh, Jim. It's Savage! There's a cave at the bottom of the cliff! No, it's too late, he'll see us! Tom, you'll have to jump. What? - Tom, jump! Come on, men! Silver! - No! Father! - No! Coral! No. And I say yes, madam. There's the cave. Come on, men! What's that? Ah, if they try to follow us at least we can defend ourselves in here! They've no need, once Silver's told them where we are, they can just wait to pick us off. So what do we do? Wait until night and how to slip back to the Eagle. Silver. I told you, I don't know where he is for sure, Mr. Savage. Not exactly. Where might they be? Go out and see your friend Jonah. Now. As I see it, it's stalemate. Hawkins has got my daughter, we've got his boat in irons. Now we could hunt each other down like rats and who knows where that'd end, or we could take the long view and declare a truce like and parlay. Just tell me where Hawkins is hiding. Why, man? I owes him. I owes him that. I cannot betray Jim Hawkins. No! Mr. Silver, I'm an officer in the king's navy. No matter what compassion I feel for any fellow man, I have a duty to perform. And that duty is to take Hawkins and his damn ship back to England! Now you tell me where he is or so help me, I'll scatter these ashes to the four winds! You wouldn't do that! It's your choice, Silver! Please! Please! For God's sake, Mr. Savage! Hawkins, Silver, I want Hawkins! I can't, man! I owes him, I owes him thanks! Then thank him for this. What, no, no! No, no, no! No, no! You will give me Hawkins before nightfall or I'll hang you like a dog from the nearest tree! Tie him up! Oh no! The salt will help the soreness. Sorry. Thank you. Her ashes. If you'd only let my father and I talk to Mr. Savage... Savage was the one who stole my ship, the Hawk. No, that can't be. He is responsible for bringing me and no doubt many other good, honest merchants to the brink of ruin and may yet push me over. No, there must be some mistake, Mr. Savage is honorable. How can you be John Silver's daughter and yet be so innocent? It's up to you now, Rose. When you finds Jim Hawkins, you knows what to say. Only that, mind, what John Silver says. Pretend to drink. I need you help. 15 men on the deadman's chest Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum Drink and the devil had done for the rest Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum Come on! - Shut up! Shut your mouth! Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum Drink and the devil had done for the rest Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum If this tide goes out much further, they'll be able to bring a cannon in here. Jim! Jim! Mr. Hawkins! Mr. Hawkins! It's Jonah! Jim, could be a trap! Jonah wouldn't do that. What message did they take to Hawkins? That's for me to know and you to learn of, Mr. Savage. Go ahead and do your worst, you can't hurt me no more! Not now! What would you do, Mr. Savage, in Jim Hawkins' place? Sail off on the Eagle? Take the Sea Wolf while she's shorthanded? Or get killed trying a foolhardy rescue of a worthless old man? You can't fool me, Silver. Making the right choice, that's what marks out a great leader from the boys. Uncle John said you can escape on the Eagle while Savage is at the Stockade. He'll try and keep him there! We can't leave him, they will hang him. We can't save him, miss, we're outnumbered. You can get your men from the ship. We've got to try, Jim, he didn't betray you! It could be a trap, Jim, he's tried it before, why trust Silver now when we've got a chance to get away? Tom, take your men back to the Eagle, make sail to attack the Sea Wolf. What? If Savage is expecting an attack on the Stockade, the ship will be undermanned and that is our chance. Where are you going? Savage won't expect one man to attempt a rescue, will he? Ah, Jim, you're crazy! Tom, destroy the Sea Wolf or he'll destroy us! I'm coming with you. Tom, take her with you, in irons if you have to. Hard a-prow side, half prow! All set, Mr. Pearce? Oh, aye-aye, sir. Then let Hawkins come, Silver, let him come! And you'll be scattered all over the island like your wife before you. Where's Miss Silver? Her ankles were hurting. Coral, Coral! Miss Silver! Why was I risking my own life to save a man I still wasn't sure I could trust? Had he broken away to leave Savage from us? And was he really holding Savage at the Stockade so we could make good our escape? Or was he guiding me, once again, towards my doom? With John Silver, you could never know, but somehow I had to find out, once and for all, and finish this. Jim? Coral! Jim? No, stop! Jim! Jim! Hawkins, Jim Hawkins! Surrender or Silver will be blown to the devil where he belongs! I'll count to 10, Hawkins. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Ready, Mr. Feathers? Aye, sir! Six! Seven! Eight! Hold, Savage, hold! Pearce! Mr. Hawkins! Mr. Hawkins. Oh, Mr. Savage, thank God, thank God! There, there, Miss Silver, you're safe now. But where are the rest of your men? They're on the Sea Wolf, in case Mr. Hawkins here tried his luck. Then my father warned you. Warned me? Of the attack on your ship. On the contrary, he tried to persuade me of an attack on the Stockade, or so it seemed. Then why are you men not here? What did my father say? That Hawkins would not try to rescue him. Then he did warn you. Mr. Hawkins has sent his men to your ship and you have my father tied in great danger! Sir, how could you? Mr. Savage, my father is as true an Englishman as ever lived. There are no more of Hawkins' men out there. No, on my word you must believe me. Release him. Release him! Look! Thank you, Lord. Father! Father! So, Mr. Hawkins, the game is finally won. It seems you as as poor a judge of your friends as you are of your country, to trust your life and your ship to this rogue! Now hold it tight and squeeze the trigger, can you manage that? I reckon so, Master Tom. Wait for the signal when I get in position. Yes, master. Good luck. You're beaten, sir. Your ship is no match for the Sea Wolf. Surrender your vessel to me! Go hang. No, sir, it is you who will hang, from the yardarm! You see now? You see the flag you wrap yourself in? It is flown by thieves and murders and cowards! Take that back, sir! Never! That's it, that's the signal, fire! I can't, look! Oh no, Captain Flint! Seize him, Patch, seize him! Hold, Mr. Savage, he deserves a fair trial! He's had his trial, Silver! You all saw, he's guilty of treason! No! Fire! Jim! We're under attack, we're under attack! Hawkins! - No! Jim, Jim. Silver! I'll see you in hell, McNab! Drop it, McNab! Drop it! Hawkins! Hear! Come along! Oh yeah? Come on! You haven't won, Hawkins! Save your breath. Father! Jim. How are you, Long John? Not good, matey. Not good. Long John's made his last voyage, I reckon. Take more than a musket ball to finish old Long John Silver. Aye, it's not that that's finished him, matey. I can't leave her here, can I? I can't leave my Cleo on her own. Father! - Shh! But I ain't finished. I have to put young Hawkins here straight. Can't have my daughter marryin' no man who tolerates slavery. Tell him, Jim. Tell him. For my Cleo. You're free, Jonah, you're a free man. And so be I. And so the long nightmare of Treasure Island had ended, perhaps at last the place had find a kind of peace. The peace of John Silver, laid to rest on the island where his beloved wife's ashes mingled with the earth, together again at last. What course shall I set, Mr. Hawkins? For America, Tom, there's a new country to be won!
