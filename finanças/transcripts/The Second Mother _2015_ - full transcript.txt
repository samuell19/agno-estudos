He put our minds to work, putting together a theater group... -And why architecture? -Why did you choose Architecture? -Ah, there are many things, I think.

I made a floor plan of a house there, a townhouse that they even ended up building, -Look at that. -I think it's important I have a diploma, -Of course. -And I believe that architecture is an instrument for social change -You see? The country is really changing. -Would you look at that? -Awesome. -Very good. -Very good. Good luck. -The house is a bit modernist, right?

It's very good. -Very good. -Thank you Val. Oh, Val, it's not this one. It's that one, the one that's almond chocolate. -Fabinho's? -It's not Fabinho's. It's ours, it's Jessica's, the other one. Almond chocolate. -Fabinho's ice cream? -The almond chocolate ice cream. -Have you been there? Brasilia. -Yes, Brasilia is very nice. -Now when Fabinho wants the ice cream, -The bean broth was excellent. -There's no way to eat without beans. -Let me serve, Val. -Look how beautiful. It looks tasty. -This is mine. -Thank you. -Is it this one? -No, let me serve. -Did you ever eat this before? -Never. not in this little container. -Are there no sweets? She asked "Are there no sweets?" Are there no sweets? -She doesn't even get up when you go in the kitchen. -Edna. Please. I'm the one talking about Jessica. It's not for you to talk about Jessica, I'm talking about Jessica. "Are there no sweets?" And bla bla bla. Nobody deserves that. Visit I don't know what, I don't know what else, with Dr.Carlos. It's like she doesn't... ...have any notion about anything in this life. Gosh! Gosh! Edna! Look at that. I went with so much force that -You're very nervous. Let me fix it. -These old stuff. -The hallway...there's the dining room, the bigger room, you see? The things here of this floor. Over here. And down over here, in the inferior is your room, -And why is this called a plant? -Good question. I don't know. -You don't know? -No. -But is that what you want to do? -Yeah, more or less. -Val? -It's not just this. -Val? -I'm going. -Will you clean the table, please? -Val, will you bring the ice cream, please? -Can you give me a little bit, Val? -This ice cream is Fabinho's. -But he said I could have some. -When they say that, when they offer something that is theirs, it's out of politeness. It's because they're sure that we're going to say no. -Thank you. -Do you want mine? -No. -If you're going to have ice cream, eat this one, that's ours. -It's very impressive, isn't it? it seems like the buildings don't end. We keep looking there, But there is something that I am thinking that I found very awesome in the television, It was a show that talked about the possibility of us not existing anymore. And then it said that in one-hundred years everything would be taken over by jungles. Everything would be back and I keep thinking about it. I think that's interesting. -One-hundred years? -It's a small amount of time, isn't it? I don't know if it was one-hundred. I don't remember. Thank you for the trip. I really liked it. -No problem. -I'm sorry, Jose Carlos. -I'm sorry. Hello? Hi. Hi Janaina. What? But what...is it serious? But what happened? Ok. Is she alright? Ok. I'll be right there. Barbara had an accident. -Was it serious? -It doesn't seem so. It seems she's Ok. -No, we're going. Of course. - I have to go there -Barbara hit her head. -She hurt her forehead? -Holy Mary. -And her shoulder? -She hurt her forehead. -Her forehead and her shoulder, and they said she was nervous... -Mrs. Barbara is nervous? -Yeah, she hit her car, right? It scared her. -What a scare, oh, my god. -What do they do to keep the water so clean, Val? -Don't keep looking at that pool, Jessica. That's not for you. -I didn't say anything. -You didn't say anything but you thought something, I know. You hear me? -You never swam here before? -I am going to swim at someone else's pool in someone else's house? -Never? -Never. And if one day the ask you to swim in this pool you'll say "I have no bathing suit, I can't." Understand? -I understand. -Hey, val. -Val! -Don't do that, Skull. Ow, Skull Get out of there with that hair! That hairy dude is Skull. Go comb your hair to talk to my daughter. -How are you? -It's Jessica. -Nice to meet you. -Are we going to swim or what? -That boy's got nothing in his head. -How about you, Jessica? You're not going in? -It's very good. -I have no bathing suit. -Come in with those clothes, Jessica. -No, I'm wearing clothes. -I think your mom is coming. It's Mrs. Barbara. -Go away! Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, no. No! Stop! -You want to sit up a bit more, right? -Yes. -Who's in the pool? Fabinho? -Fabinho and Skull. -Oh, Ok. -Them both, the both of them. -But there is someone else; who is it? Jessica? -No, Jessica is only there waiting for me. She was just looking. But...I'm going to see what this racket is. Excuse me. -Go away! No! Stop that! -Jessica! Get out of there, Jessica! Jessica, get out of there, now. Dr. Carlos is here, Jessica. -Fabinho! -Jessica. I don't know what she's thinking. to go in... I'm going there, Dr.Carlos. -Look at the contractors there looking. Fabinho! -Carlos? Carlos, help me. Jose Carlos, help me! Oh, Fabinho! What a stupid prank, Fabinho. Take her out of there. -Jessica, get out of there! Get out of there! -I'm going! -Get out, Jessica! -Can you obey your mother? She's talking to you. -Get out if that water! -Obey your mother. -She's going to catch a cold. -Obey Dr.Carlos, Mrs.Barbara. -I'm going. -Have you lost your mind? Get out of that pool. -Jessica! Look. -I'm going, Val. -You are taking too long. Come, come...come! -You don't need to grab me like that. -Come, Jessica! I'm going to get the towel. Where's the towel? Wait, you're naked. Are you crazy? -Fabinho? Fabinho! Get out of there, I want to talk to you. Mom, you're humiliating me. -Now, Fabinho. -Dad, look... -Now, Fabinho! -Listen to your mother, Fabinho. -I'm going. Are you drugged? Did you smoke today? Drugged? What are you taking about? -What am I talking about? Fabinho, I was in an accident. Did you know that? That I was unconscious? That the ambulance took me to the hospital? I'm all busted? -but the doctor said that everything's OK. -Is that why you don't even come to see me, Fabinho? You don't even come to see me, man. You don't care one bit about me. You don't even come see me. -Calm down, mom. -Calm down? Calm down is great. It's terrible. -May I go? -yes, you can. -Ok, bye. -Do you have Carlos from the pool's phone number there? Call him, please. Do you have it in your phone? -Yes. Give it to me. I'm going to talk to him. Press Talk. -Claudio? Hi, it's Barbara from the Morumbi. I know. But I need you to come tomorrow. Can you? -Yeah, something went wrong here. -Go on, Maggie. Stop with that sniffing. Poop quicker, Maggie. Today, I don't have any patience even for you, you hear? But you did everything to make him throw you in the pool. -You weren't even looking, Val. You don't know what you're saying. -I'm telling you I want to leave this place, you understand? -it is better if you do. -Didn't I say that since the beginning? -This is not working. -It really isn't. -And I told you so. I don't know where you learned these things. You keep saying "You can't this, you can't that" Was it ever written in a book or something? How is it? Who taught you? When you arrived here were they explaining these things to you? -Those things people don't need to explain. People are born knowing it. What you can do and what you can't. You seem like you're from another planet. -I know. We are born knowing it. -How are you? -I'm good, dear. -What's up? -So, did you find out the price of that room in Campo Limpo? -I already talked to them, Ok? I talked to Adneia, and everything is alright. Isn't the price good? -400. -It's great. We're going now, right Val? -Ok. It's actually better. Tomorrow I'm coming. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah, because things aren't working out there. -Why? Want happened? -You can't imagine. -Nothing. -I'll tell you later. She went to the pool... -Let's go, Val. -Holy moly. -At Mrs. Barbara's pool? Later you come here, Val. For us to talk. -Raimunda I'm almost going crazy. Ok, Bye. -So let's do this: I'll take the pictures, I'll choose the best ones -Ok. -Because I don't want you tiring yourself now. You have to look beautiful and marvelous. -Ok. -Mrs. Barbara, we're leaving. -Ok. You decided to find your own place to stay. -Technically. -Ok. Did you leave the pie? -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you very much, Ok? -You're welcome. -So we're leaving. Excuse me. -Good luck on the college admission test. -So, let's continue. -Dr. Carlos... -Hi. -Thank you. -Good luck. It was a pleasure. -Pleasure. -Ok let me... -No, Dr. Carlos, for the love of God. -No, have a little treat.

It is more like a parlor. -Yeah, it used to be a parlor before, but the person who lived here made a little parlor. There's even this huge mirror. -Raimunda, I think these walls are too red. Don't you think it's a bit showy? -It's not. That's what makes it pretty. -Just paint it, Val. -You think so, Jessica? -Yes, you can paint it. -Look here. There is this window that brings this fresh air every afternoon, And it's also gated. It is totally secured. The shower is brand new, and it's also very good. -Yeah, we're going to stay. -Ok. -Did you like it? -It's good, Val. We'll make do. -Let's talk to Pedro downstairs. Talk nicely, and I think it will work out. Let's go talk to him. We'll talk nicely to him. -I said that I wanted... Just a moment, Raimunda, didn't you tell him that I was working it out? -I thought everything had worked out. Raimunda, look. -The problem is that there was no deposit, understand? -Deposit for what if I didn't see the house? -How is someone going to deposit money if there is no one home? -Ok, let's do this: I'm going to turn things around -I am going to find you a house. -Is there something to see today? -Not today, but... -I waned to stay here already. Let me stay at your house today, Bruna. -But this week? This week? Edimilson is coming today. -It's only for tonight that I'm asking. -I can't. -Edmilson only has one free day each week, it's just for tonight. -He only has one free day. He's arriving. Calm down, Jessica. -I didn't want to go back there. It's only for one week, Jessica. -We had agreed to stay here already. -It will be over soon. -Are they treating you bad? -No, it's not this. -Dr. Carlos? Fabinho? Do you have a crush on Fabinho? -I'm not saying that. -Dr. Carlos is even cherishing her. -Carlos? José Carlos! -Yes? -Her gracious little daughter is back. -Right, Val? -Yes, Uh, Dr. Carlos? it's only for one week. -Val, there's no problem at all. -I thank you so much, but I gave my word. -You stay as long as you need, no problem. -Thank you. -It won't be for long, Mrs. Barbara. -Oh, Ok. Hey, you know what I saw in the pool? A rat, Val. -No -Can you believe it? -Really, Mrs. Barbara? -A rat. I screamed from up here. -You came back. The room didn't work out? -No, it didn't. -Do you want one? -I have one here already. -You know this house here is almost as if it were yours Anything that you'll need The house even got a bit empty, you know? -Thank you. -Do you believe in reincarnation? -I don't know. I never thought much about it. -I don't believe it, I don't believe it because It think it's only this time, you know? So... sometimes we say things that may seem crazy, you know? But if I don't say it, Maybe it is crazy if we only have this one time. You know? Uh... Do you want to marry me? Marry me. I'll take you anywhere you want. -Uh... -It's hot, isn't it? -Sorry, José Carlos. -No, I'm sorry. -I don't know what to say. -It's yes. Say yes. Say yes. Marry me. -No, -Sorry. I am... -I don't... I don't understand. -I'm sorry, it's... I was just kidding. I was kidding. -You were kidding? -I was kidding. It was a joke. -Wow, you scared me. -I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -She's coming to São Paulo, she never comes, and since Jessica has vacated the guest room, I told her she could stay here in my house, so she is coming and I will need you to help Jessica move to your room. -Of course. -Ok? -She will go to my room -Great.

But tell her to leave the room today, Ok? -Ok, yes ma'am. -Alright, thank you. -Let me go, because I've got a pot on the range. -Can't you open the window, Val? -If I open the window, It'll be as hot, the only thing that it'll do is bring in more mosquitoes. -Sincerely, Val, I don't know how you can stand it. -How I stand what? -To be treated this way, like a second-class citizen. This is worse than India. -Don't go talking this difficult subject of India, because you are snobby, that's what you are. -This is all too shitty, that's what it is. -Stop swearing. Because I don't like swearing. -You think you're all that. You think you're better than everyone, you are superior to everyone. -I don't think I'm superior, Val, I just don't think I'm inferior, understand? It's different. -You are going to make me lose this job. -Oh, fuck it. -Watch your language. Go wash your mouth with soap. Respect me because I'm your mother. -Oh, no, you're not my mom. -Sandra is the one who raised me. You have nothing to do with this. Look down. Sandra raised you with the money I sent her every month to pay for your school, pay for your dentist... Sandra got the easy part. Sandra was with you, and I was here, only working, working hard. Sandra is your mom, Sandra is...Sandra's bill, you know who sent her money every month. I'm tired, you know? Of hearing this kind of thing. Tired. Tired. -No, everything's alright. I'm studying...

You have to understand my side of the story, my daughter. -And you should have defended me. -Didn't I defend you? -I'm not going to talk about this because I don't want to fight again. -Mother of God. -They thought you were so pretty. All rich, full of things, when you used to go by and visit. They don't know how much I suffered because of you. -You don't know how much I suffered because of you. -You suffered because you wanted to. You always went there carrying many presents telling me this, telling me that, and then leaving me there like an idiot asking "When does my mommy return" "What time does she return?" -You don't know half of it. One day I asked your dad. -Fuck that, Val. Ten years! Why didn't you come back? -You don't know what I went through. The longer I stayed the more I wanted to go back, but the time passed and I didn't go back, but even if I didn't go back... I'm going to tell you something: one day God forbid, God forbid, but one day you will understand your mother very much. Who is this boy? Jessica, I am asking you who this boy is. Jessica, why doesn't your father speak to you? I don't understand why your father doesn't speak to you. Jessica, I'm asking you. Who is this boy, Jessica? It's Jorge. -I don't know who Jorge is -He's my son. -Oh, my God. -Jessica, I can't believe it, Jessica. And why didn't you ever tell me, Jessica? -Because we weren't even talking. How would I tell you something like that? -And you left the boy there? You left the boy there? -I did, Val. How was I going to study, do the exam? Would I bring the boy with me? -Oh, my God. And you won't bring the boy? -Yes, I will. As soon as I can I will. -So cute. -When? -When I can, Val. -Oh, Thank you, Val. it's alright. -Oh, my god, send a a man like this to that end of the world/ My little boy, my precious. Love of mine.
