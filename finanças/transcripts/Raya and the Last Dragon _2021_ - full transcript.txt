I know what you're thinking. A lone rider. A dystopian world. A land that's gone to waste. How did this world getso broken? Well, that all began 500 years ago. Kumandra. This is what we used to be. When our land was whole, and we lived harmoniously alongside... dragons. Magical creatures who brought us waterand rain and peace. It was paradise. But then, the Druun came. A mindless plague that spread like wildfire, multiplying as they consumed life and turned everyone they touched into stone. The dragons fought for us the best they could, but it wasn't enough. That's when the Mighty Sisudatu, the last dragon, concentrated all her magic into a gem and... ...blasted the Druun away. Everyone that was turned to stone came back. Except the dragons. All that was left of Sisu was her gem. It should have been this big inspirational moment, where humanity united over her sacrifice. But instead, people being people, they all fought to possess the last remnant of dragon magic. Borders were drawn, Kumandra divided. We all became enemies, and the gem had to be hidden. But that's not how the world broke. That didn't truly happen until 500 years later, when I came into the story. Hmm. Huh. Looks like someone's trying to be clever. All right, Tuk Tuk, let's show 'em what clever really looks like. Tuk Tuk! Come on! Focus! Thank you. Hey, bud, that was awesome. Give me some shell. I got ya. Whoa. Wait a second. This feels too easy. Chief Benja. I know it's your job to try and stop me, but you won't. Don't mistake spirit for skill, young one. I promise you will not set foot on the Dragon Gem's inner circle. Not even a toe. You might wanna take out that blade. You're gonna need it. Not today. Boop. Like I said, not one foot on the inner circle. You lost, Raya. Did I? Raya... I probably should have said two feet. Hey, don't beat yourself up too much, Chief Benja. You gave it your best. I won't. And it's either "Father" or "Ba" to you. You did good, dewdrop. You passed the test. Wow. The spirit of Sisu. For generations, our family has sworn to protect the gem. Today, you will join that legacy. Raya, Princess of Heart, my daughter, you are now a Guardian of the Dragon Gem. Whoa. Ah... Well, someone's excited. Well, yeah! I mean, anyone hoping to steal the Dragon Gem now has to face the fury of the two baddest blades in all the lands. I'm glad you feel prepared, dewdrop, because I have something important to tell you. The other lands, they're on their way here, as we speak. They are? Uh... Okay. Okay, no, we can do this. I'm ready. I know exactly how we'll stop them. Really? Tell me what you know about the other lands. First... Tail. A sweltering desert with sneaky mercenaries who fight dirty. Second, Talon. A floating market famous for fast deals and fighters with even faster hands. Third, Spine. A frigid bamboo forest guarded by exceptionally large warriors, and their giant axes. Fourth, Fang. Our fiercest enemy. A nation protected by angry assassins, and their even angrier cats. Okay, so we're gonna need some crossbows and catapults and... Ooh! What about flaming catapults? Or, how about shrimp paste from Tail. lemongrass from Talon, bamboo shoots from Spine, chilis from Fang and palm sugar from Heart? We'll poison them? No, we're not going to poison them and we're not going to fight them. We're going to share a meal with them. - Wait, what? - I invited them. But they're our enemies. They're only our enemies because they think the Dragon Gem magically brings us prosperity. That's ridiculous. It doesn't do that. They assume it does, just like we assume things about them. Raya, there's a reason why each land is named after a part of the dragon. We were once unified. Harmoniously as one. Kumandra. That's ancient history, Ba. But it doesn't have to be. Listen, if we don't stop and learn to trust one another again, it's only a matter of time before we tear each other apart. This isn't the world I want you to live in. I believe that we can be Kumandra again. But someone has to take the first step. Trust me. Things look a little tense, Ba. Don't worry, I'm gonna open with a joke. Please don't. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. People of Tail, Talon, Spine, and Fang, welcome to Heart. For far too long, we have been enemies, but today is a new day. Today, we can be Kumandra once more. Nice speech, Chief Benja. But why'd you really bring us here? Are you gonna rob us? Why would he need to rob us? The land of Heart already has everything. Oh, it's easy to pontificate on Kumandra when you hold the mightiest weapon in all the lands. The gem's not a weapon. It's a sacred relic. Kumandra! Kumandra's a joke! He brought us all this way to talk about fairy tales. This is pointless! I have something to say. Who's hungry? Oh. Go ahead. It's all right. I'm Namaari, of Fang. Hi, Namaari. I'm Raya. Is that Sisu? Sorry, um, yeah, I might be a little bit of a dragon nerd. Hey, I'm the one wearing the Sisu fan necklace. Come on. Have you eaten yet? Seriously? Your mom actually said that? Awkward. Okay, next question. Hand-to-hand or swords? - Blades all day. - Right? Okay, dressy or casual? Only a monster would choose to wear this outfit on the regular. Uh, rice or stew? I didn't think that'd stump you. Uh... This is actually one of the first times I've had rice in awhile. Really? Fang may look nice on the outside, but we have some pretty big holes on the inside. Oh. Sorry. Didn't mean to bring it down. So, where were we? We both have single parents who are terrible at telling jokes. We're both warrior women who despise uncomfortable formal wear. And we're both Sisu superfans. Yeah. You know, Fang legend says she's still out there. Sisu? You're kidding, right? Wanna see something? Are you supposed to have that? No. According to this, after the Mighty Sisu blasted away all the Druun, she fell into the water and floated downstream. Legends say she's now sleeping at the river's end. But which river? There's, like, hundreds. I don't know. But if we could find it, could you imagine? A dragon back in the world. Things could be so much better. Yeah. Maybe we really could be Kumandra again. Here. Whoa. Really? From one dragon nerd to another. Hmm. Hey. Come with me, dep la. I wanna show you something. The spirit of Sisu. I can feel it. It's the last bit of dragon magic left in the whole world. I see why Heart guards it so closely. Thank you, dep la. You've been very helpful. In a different world, maybe we could have been friends, but I have to do what's right for Fang. Chief Virana, I'm so glad Fang accepted our invitation. Huh? There is no way you're taking Sisu's gem. Sorry. It's Fang's now. You will not set foot on the Dragon Gem's inner circle. What's going on? What is this? Fang's making a play for the gem! No! Spine should have the gem! Not if we get to it first! Our blades say different. Listen to me! We have a choice. We can tear each other apart, or we can come together and build a better world. It's not too late. I still believe we can be Kumandra again. Ba! Out of my way! The gem belongs to Spine! Give me the gem! No... No... Druun. There's still magic in them! - Get the pieces! - No! Ba! Come on, we have to go! They're repelled by water. Hurry! Get to the river! Ba, get up! Come on! Please, we have to keep moving. Get up! Ba! We don't have time! Stand up! I'll help... Raya, you have to listen. You are the Guardian of the Dragon Gem. Ba, why are you saying this? There's still light in this. There's still hope. No! We can make it together. You're okay. Raya. Don't give up on them. I love you, my dewdrop. Ba? No! Ba! Ba. Please let this be it. Whoa! What are you doing, you big fur bug? Hey, buddy, focus. Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk. Good boy. You're so easily distracted. You're getting a little too big for this, bud. Six years of searching and we end up at a literal shipwreck. That's not a bad sign, is it? Sisudatu... Um... I don't know if you're listening. I've searched every river to find you, and now I'm here at the very last one. Look, there's not a lot of us left, and we really... We really need your help. If I can be honest, I really need your help. I made a mistake. I trusted someone I shouldn't have, and... ...now the world's broken. Sisudatu... I just really, really want my ba back. Please. Okay... Here goes everything. Suvaa de draa sim Mandra de draa lim Bavaa de draa Tomben I know, buddy, I haven't forgot... Oh, my... Where am I? Pengu? Amba? Pranee? Are you here? Oh, Mighty Sisu. Who said that? Hello? Hello? Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. Not too bad. Just a little dusty. Let me get that for ya. Sisu? You are Sisu? And you're people. What's your name? Raya. I'm Raya. And you're not made of stone, which means... It worked! We did it! You hear that, Pengu? It worked! I didn't mess it up! Is that food? I was so focused on saving the world, I forgot to have breakfast today. Today? When exactly do you think today is? Tuesday. I mean... Mmm. What is this delightful culinary treat? It's jackfruit jerky. I dried it myself. Well, compliments to the chef. Wanna finish this, Skippy? Uh... Sisu, there are a few things I need to catch you up on. Oh, yeah? You broke it? Oh, oh. Oh, my. This is bad. This is bad. I've been asleep for 500 years, you brought back the Druun, and none of my brothers and sisters came back. Why didn't they come back? I don't know. Also, you broke the gem! But I still have a big chunk of it, though. Is that supposed to make me feel better? If you lost a puppy, and I said... "Well, we still have a big chunk of it!" Would that make you feel better? Can't you just make another one? No, I can't just "make another one." But you're a dragon. I'm gonna be real with you, all right? I'm not, like, the best dragon, ya know? But you saved the world. I did do that. That's true. But have you ever done like a group project, but there's, like, that one kid who didn't pitch in as much, but still ended up with the same grade? Yeah, I wasn't the one who actually made the gem. I just turned it in. Whoa. Uh... You're glowing. Oh, thank you. I use aloe and river slime to maintain my... No, no. Look! Oh! This is my little sister Amba's magic. I got the glow! Your little sister's magic? Yeah, every dragon has a unique magic. Okay, what's yours? I'm a really strong swimmer. Wait, wait, wait, you touched this gem piece and it gave you powers. You know what this means, right? I no longer need a night light? What? No! You're still connected to the gem's magic, and that means you can still use it to save the world. If we can get all the other gem pieces... - I can reassemble it... - ...you can reassemble it... ...and boom the Druun away! And bring my ba back? And bring all of Kumandra back. Princess Namaari, the Tail lands are infested with Druun. Benja's daughter is as good as stone out here. Retrieving some useless dragon scroll isn't worth the risk. Anyone else wanna question why we're out here? Okay, so here's the sitch. After the gem broke, each piece was taken by one of the chiefs of the five lands, Fang, Heart, Spine, Talon, and Tail. Where we are now. Wow. So many questions. First one, why am I wearing this? Well, we don't want to attract attention. Oh, you definitely chose the right hat for that. So, what makes you think the Tail chief's here? Because this place didn't just booby-trap itself. This doesn't make sense. None of this would stop a Druun. It's not to stop Druun. It's to stop people. Hmm. What? Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing. I'm just not used to seeing dragons. Impressed, huh? Wait until you see my backstroke. I'm wicked when I hit that liquid. I got water skills that kill. I slaughter when I hit the water. I'm, like, really good at swimming, through rhyme. I was trying to make that... That I'm really good at swim... I'm a good swimmer, is basically what I'm... Okay, um, we need to keep going. - Oh, no! - What? What is it? We forgot to bring a gift for the Tail chief. I'm sorry. A gift? Yeah. A gift says, "You can trust me, can I trust you?" Aw. Hey there, little fella. This beetle's got a booty. Uh... Careful. It's a Toot N Boom. Why is it called a... Got it. Noted. Makes sense. Uh... You have to admit though, these bug booties are kind of cute. I'd say we found the Tail chief. What happened to her? From the looks of it, she was hoarding the gem and became a victim of her own traps. Well, you gotta admire her commitment. Okay. Hold on. Oh, we were doing a jumpy thing! So sorry. My bad. I get it now. I'm with it. Sisu... don't. Two down, three to go. I just shapechanged! Into people! Dragons can do that? This was my sister Pranee's thing. Look at my people arms and my people face. Look how close my butt is to my head. Now that you don't have to hide me, getting the rest of the gems is gonna be a breeze. Yeah, well, this one was easy, but the rest of them are being held by a bunch of no-good binturis. Binturi? That's not a very nice way to describe an old friend. Namaari. What's drippin', dep la? Oh, I see you've finally made a new friend. And here I was worried you were gonna end up becoming a cat lady like me. Something tells me you're not besties. Stealing Dragon Gem pieces, are we? Why? What can I say? Bling is my thing. Hmm. I gotta admit, Raya, until a few months ago, I thought you were stone. But then, someone stole Fang's dragon scroll. Oh, is that why you're chasing me? And here I thought it was because you missed me. Are you really looking for Sisu? What are you, 12? Yeah, I actually was looking for Sisu. Oh, and guess what? I found her. Say hi, Sisu. Hi! It's very nice to meet you, and I love your hair and your cats' hair. Take them. Run! Not like that! Two legs! Right! Tuk Tuk! Roll! Whoa! Jump! Who was that girl? That's Namaari. She's the backstabbing binturi that broke the world. Wow, those cats are really fast, huh? What do cats and Druun have in common? Um... They have no souls? And they both hate water. - Oh. - Hold on! Hello? Is anybody here? Welcome to the world-famous Shrimp-orium. My name is Boun. I'll be your server today. Would you like to hear our daily specials? Yes, please! We got shrimp, we got congee. We got a shrimp congee that won't quit. The captain, where is the captain? Let me go get him. What's up, my new customers? I'm Captain Boun, the owner, chef, and chief financial officer of the Shrimp-orium. How can I help you? Well, I'm Sisu and... And we need to get to Talon now. I'm sorry. The Shrimp-orium is not a water taxi. Toi, that's a lot of jade! Half now, half when we arrive in Talon. Deal? Clasp onto your congee. Today's special is to go. Uh, Captain Boun? Does this thing go any faster? Whoa! You didn't tell me Fang was after you! This is gonna cost you extra! Don't worry, I got it. What is she doing? What is happening? My friend's a really strong swimmer. Bye-bye, binturi. Princess Namaari, if they're after gem pieces, their next stop would be Talon. We're not following them to Talon. We're going back to Fang. I need to speak with Chief Virana. Sisu? Sisu? Ah! Please get out of there. I'm a water dragon. This is water. It's sort of my thing. You wanna come in? Someone could see you. Oh. Do you mean Captain Pop and Lock over there? What, are you scared he's gonna challenge me to a dance battle? Sisu, I saw people lose their minds over a Dragon Gem. Can you imagine what they'd do over an actual dragon? Look, we need you to make this all work. Until we have all the gems, you have to stay human. Please. Wow, you really got some trust issues. Look, my father blindly trusted people, and now, he's stone. Hey, we'll get your ba back. I got you, girl. Come on, who's your dragon? I mean, human. Because I'm gonna be a human until... Yeah, you... You get it. Okay, who's hungry? Oh, I am. Two house specials. How spicy would you like it? Hot, hotter, or Boun-goes-the-dynamite? - Bring on the heat! - Yeah, no. No, I don't think so. Uh, what are you doing? We don't know him. It could be poison. Why would he poison us? Yeah, why would I poison you? First, to get my jade purse, second, to steal my sword, and third, I don't know, to kidnap my Tuk Tuk. All good points, but if this is poison... Mmm! ...you're gonna die happy. Yeah, thanks, but we got our own eats. This is delicious. By the way, not poison. But it's... It's hot. Ooh, it's hot! It's hot! It's really hot! Oh, my! Oh! Water! Boun? Captain Boun? We need water on deck! I know, buddy. You know, during the day, you can almost forget they're here, but at night... This is why I never leave the boat. You're a smart kid. What are Druun, anyways? A plague. Born from human discord. They've always been here. Waiting for a moment of weakness to attack. They're like the opposite of dragons. Instead of bringing water and life to the world, they're like a relentless fire that consumes everything in its wake until there's nothing left except ash and stone. They took my family. They took mine, too. Looks like we're here. So, where are you guys heading after Talon? I might be heading there, too. I mean, for a fee, of course. Of course. Wow! What a smart way to Druun-proof your house. Build right on the water. People of Talon are geniuses. Yeah. Talon may look nice, but it's a hotspot for pickpockets and con artists. Lucky for me. Empty pockets! Okay, so here's the good news. I know where the gem piece is. The bad news? It's being held by the notorious Chief of Talon, Dang Hai. What Dang Hai lacks in style, he makes up in mean. Hmm. Gotcha. Now, we're just gonna have to turn up the charm. Let's go get him a gift. Sisu, I think maybe it's safer for you to stay here on the boat. What? Without you, we can't put the gem back together. But I wanna help. I know, and you will. By staying safe. I'll be back before you know it. If you see any hungry faces, send 'em my way. You got it, Captain. All right, there's Dang Hai's house. No detours till we score that Dragon Gem. Whoa. What in the... Uh... Okay. Hey, baby, toddler, thing... ...whatever you're called. It's really late. What are you doing out here? Where are your parents? Hey, uh, whose baby... What? Ongis? Drop 'em! Ow! Really? A con-baby? Ah, this is giving me bad feels. Chief Dang Hai does not sound like someone you could smooth talk. And Raya didn't even bring a gift. That's it. I'm going shopping. Oh, wait. I don't have any money. You're an adult. You could just put it on credit. Oh... Uh, what's credit? It's kinda like a promise. You take what you want now, and you promise you'll pay it back later. Pay it back later? Huh! What an amazing concept. Thanks, Captain Boun. I'll be buying this with credit. Oh, Dang Hai's gonna love this! Credit, please. Oh, I like that. Uh, yeah, I'll be using credit, yes. I love credit! Hey, you! Are you going to pay for any of that? Oh! Right, right. No, this is on credit. Yeah, I'm gonna pay it back later. Pay us back later? We don't know you. You have no credit here. - Pay us right now. - Now? I don't have anything, but if I could just find my girl Raya, she has a sword, dried eats, two Dragon Gem pieces. No, we don't! What? Who said that? You better pay up, binturi. This isn't a charity. Who do you think you're stealing from? Get away from her! Can't you see she's new in town? Come, dear. Don't be afraid. It's okay. Hey, watch out! Bye! Diaper! Thanks. So, it's none of my business, but using your baby charm to rip people off... ...is super sketchy. All right, where is your family? Mm. Oh... Right. Hey. How would you like to earn some honest loot? Gah? All right, Dang Hai, I'll take that Dragon Gem piece. Whoa! I'm not Dang Hai. I'm Chai, the flower guy. Where is Dang Hai? He's right over there. What? Who has his gem piece? The most vicious chief Talon has ever seen. Those folks were, like, crazy mad. I just wanted to bring some gifts to the Talon chief Dang Hai. Is that who you're looking for, dear? I know exactly where he is. You do? Mm-hmm. I will take you there. See? That's what I've been trying to tell my girl Raya. And she's all like, "You can't trust people." "Don't talk to anyone." "I only eat terrible foods I dried myself." Come, dear. Chief Dang Hai is just outside the city, beyond the gates. Away from the water, huh? Wow. He really likes living on the edge. Hi there, Dang Hai. Um, I'm Sisu, and I've come here to offer you some... Uh... Now, you're gonna tell me where I can find those other Dragon Gem pieces, or I'll have to leave you outside with that thing. Take your pick. But I... I trusted you. Big mistake. You better talk fast. It looks hungry. No. No, no. No, no, no! Raya! Stop her! Sisu, I told you to stay on the boat. Sorry! Hold on to this for me, will ya? Fog? Yeah. That was my brother Jagan's magic. Okay. Three down, two to go. All right, Captain Boun, next stop, Spine... Aah! Thanks for the new customers! Yeah, I sort of promised to buy them all the congee they could eat. Well, we're stuck with them for a while 'cause ongis have nine stomachs. Oh, toi. I can't believe it. That old lady was really gonna hurt me. Well, I'm sorry, Sisu, but that's what the world is now. You can't trust anyone. Does that include babies? - Uh, well... - She's so cute. I mean, look at those cheeks. Hi, I'm Sisu. She loves my face. Yeah, watch out she doesn't steal your teeth. Here, let me help you. Oh, that's so sweet. Okay, that's, uh... That's too much sweet... Too much sweetness. It's too much! Chief Virana, we're running out of room. We need to expand to the mainland. And how do you propose we handle the Druun, General Atitāya? Without proper protection, it would be a death sentence for our people. I might have a solution for that, Mother. My little morning mist... Oh, it's good to see you home. I located Raya. She's out stealing gem pieces. What? I'd like to take the royal army and intercept her in Spine. Well, if she's going into Spine, I doubt there'll be much left of her to intercept. She's more capable than you realize. We have to stop her. Walk with me. Look around. We made all this by making smart decisions, not emotional ones. We are safe. Our canal protects us from those monsters. I don't think it's wise to risk yourself when you don't have to. But you heard the general. We're running out of space. We need to expand. If we had all the gem pieces, we could do that safely. You're right. This isn't an emotional decision. It's the only decision we can make to secure Fang's future. Namaari, you're truly growing into the leader I raised you to be. General Atitāya, ready the royal army for my daughter's command. Thank you, Mother. I won't let you down. Hey! Stop eating! Whoa! Sorry, buddy, I got this. Did you just throw a shrimp at me? That's not even edible! - Hey! - Don't look at me... Uh... Hey, guys? ...like that, you fuzzy garbage can! Do you wanna play hide-and-seek? All right. Ready? One. Two. - Thanks. - Two and a half. Three. Remind me to never have kids. Being people is hard. Yep. Six. Seven. You have small heads. No tails. You lie to get what you want, like the Talon chief back there. Yeah, well, the world's broken. You can't trust anyone. Or maybe the world's broken because you don't trust anyone. You sound just like my ba. Well, he sounds like a smart man. Yeah, he was. I really wanted to believe him. I really wanted to believe that we could be Kumandra again. And we can. Literally thousands of people turned to stone would argue otherwise. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try. And I did. And you know what happened? I got kicked in the back by someone who gave me a gift. Look around. We're a world of orphans because people couldn't stop fighting over a gem. Wanna know why other dragons didn't come back? It's because people don't deserve them. But you can change that. No, Sisu, I am done trying. Kumandra is a fairy tale. The only thing important to me now is bringing my ba back. Um... I think we're in Spine. Sisu! Hey, my congee! Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. Sisu! Come back! Please! What... What are you doing? I'm going to show you that you're wrong! How? By getting squashed by a bunch of Spine rage-heads? No. By proving to you that if you wanna get someone's trust, you have to give a little trust first. Wait, Sisu, don't... In hindsight, maybe I was a little hasty, but, uh, who's hungry? No? I'll leave you alone. Okay, where are we? Interesting choice of digs. You two must be dung of brain to think you could steal Spine's Dragon Gem. Gem? Who said anything about gems? We have no interest in gems. Okay, yeah, I can see how that makes me look like a liar. Actually, I think it was the lying that made you look like a liar. I'm not sure what's funny. Your fear is like delectable nectar feeding the tum-tum of my soul. It's good. Tastes like... mango. Oh. I love mango. Of course you love mango! Only a tongue-less cretin wouldn't. Oh, toi! It's been such a long time since I've last peered into the eyes of a trembling enemy. Where has the time gone? It's been so long. He seems lonely. No! I'm not lonely. I'm a Spine warrior. I was born and bred to do only one thing. To invoke fear and to crush the skulls of my enemies! That's actually two things. Look at your face. Hey. What do you plan on doing with us? Oh, it's gonna be bad. Horrifying! It'll take me two weeks to clean up! You have no idea, do you? Yes, I do. I'm formulating this gruesome plan in my head... Makes me sick just thinking about it. You... You just wait. Until then, why don't you just hang around? Good one, huh? Huh? A little one? All right! Phew! Good work, Captain Boun! - Fang's here! - What? People of Spine, we are hunting for Raya, a fugitive from Heart! Send her out, or we're coming in! You're the only one here? My people battled the Druun with much valor, but lost. Okay. But the Fang gang's here for me, not for you, so, um, if I can distract them, then you guys can get out of here. You're gonna fight an entire army? No, I'm just gonna stall them. Look, I know how to push Namaari's buttons. And once you guys are clear, I'm out of there. What's your name? The moniker given to me is Tong. Okay, Tong, look, you don't know me, and I don't know you, but I'm sure that you know a back door or a way outta here, and it's really important that my friends stay safe, okay? So, I am sincerely asking you, will you help us? Please. Okay. Note to self, don't die. Burn them out. Hey there, Princess Undercut. Fancy meeting you here. You and the Dragon Gem pieces are coming with me. Hmm. My sword here says we're not. Yeah, I knew you couldn't handle rolling solo. You're nothing without your band. Stand down. This shouldn't take long. Did you need that, dep la? Nah. Looks like somebody's been taking classes. Why are you stealing gem pieces? Oh, I'm just trying to get a matching set. You didn't happen to bring Fang's gem, did you? No? Never mind. I'll just swing by and grab it later. Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this. Yep, she's a dragon. Let's go. Come on! Did you just hit me with a shrimp tail? When were you gonna tell us she was Sisu? Well, technically, you always knew she was Sisu. Seriously? Why are you here, divine water dragon? Isn't that obvious, big guy? My girl Raya and I are gonna fix the world. Bring everyone back. You're gonna bring everyone back? I wanna help. I'm sorry, I can't let you do that. It's too dangerous. You're not the only one who lost family to the Druun. Please. Let me help you. I too wish to join this fellowship of Druun butt-kickery! My big brother Pengu's magic. All right, Captain Boun. To Fang. You got it! All right, everyone, here's the plan. The last gem piece is in Fang, the most heavily guarded of the five lands. Now, they're protected by an artificial canal that separates them from the rest of the world. The only way in or out is by water. Luckily for us, we have a magic water dragon. Now, the palace will be swarmingwith Fang soldiers. To sneak past them, we'll need to... I got this, guys. I'll take care of the first wave. Tong will follow up with hisgiant axe of bad-axery. And then come the ongis and that crazy con-baby... ...who will toss the gem to the Mighty Sisudatu. And then, bye-bye, binturis. Super flow plan, am I right? Uh, no. Yeah, that's not flow. That's a clog. I agree. Here's my plan. We infiltrate Fang, confront Namaari, and offer her something nice and go... Hey! Wanna help us save the world? Because all it takes is one gem piece. Yes! I've been waiting for someone to ask me! Here you go! Best friends forever! Yeah, I think I'd rather go with Boun's plan. What? Yes! What, why? Because it's Fang. Their blades are specially designed for the stabbing of backs. If it weren't for them, none of this would have happened. They're the worst. If we're just honest with her, deep down, I got a feeling she wants to fix the world as much as we do. You weren't there when Namaari betrayed me. We're sticking with my plan. Whoa. Uh... What's with the downpour? Come on! I need to show you something. So, what do we do now? I don't know. Where are you taking me? Sisu, why did you bring me here? This is where it all happened. Yeah, I know. - I was there. - No. This is where it all happened 500 years ago. I want you to meet my brothers and sisters. The real mighty ones. I miss them. I never knew they were here. See that classy-looking one over there? That's Amba. I get my glow from her. And that's Pranee. She's a shapeshifter. Jagan, fog. And Pengu. He's our big brother. He brings the rain. We were the last dragons. All the other dragons had been turned to stone. We were drowning in a sea of Druun. But my oldest brother Pengu refused to accept defeat. This is where we'd make our last stand... united. So, one by one, they combined all their magic, creating the Dragon Gem. I don't know why they chose me. It could have been any of us. All I know is I trusted them... ...and they trusted me. And so... When they put their faith in me, it empowered me beyond anything I could imagine. The same can happen with Namaari. I really wish I could believe that. I once thought that we could be friends. After all this, maybe you can be. Even if she wanted to help us, how could I possibly trust her? But if somehow you could, you wouldn't just bring your ba back. You'd also bring back his dream. Kumandra. Do you think he would even recognize me? So much has changed. Of course he will. You remind me of him. Oh, yeah? Strong? Good-looking with impeccable hair? Hopeful. How would I even approach Namaari after all that's happened? It may feel impossible, but sometimes, you just have to take the first step, even before you're ready. Trust me. Okay. We'll go with your plan. What? My plan? You're gonna go with my plan? - Yeah. - All right! You're not gonna regret this. But we're gonna need a really good gift. What do you think she's into? Cats? Knives? Cats with knives? Knives with little cats on them? Actually, I know exactly what to give her. And that is how the land of Fang rose in spite of all the monsters that wanted to destroy us. Because we're smart, resilient, and we take care of one another. Mother! We need to talk. It's Princess Namaari! All right, all right, now, run along, kittens. I have to speak with the princess. Mother, you won't believe what I saw. You saw a dragon. General Atitāya informed me that you'd be returning home without the gem pieces. It was Sisu. She can fix what we broke. She can bring everyone back. And that's what scares me. When everyone comes back, who do you think they'll come for? You forget. The other lands blame us for what's happened. But we... We never meant for anyone to get hurt. Yes, but if we had the dragon and the gem pieces, we would be forgiven. We could save the world. But more importantly, our people would remain safe. But Raya isn't just gonna give Sisu to us. We're not going to give her a choice. What are you going to do? That's no longer your concern, my love. You've done enough. If she refuses to help, we've just flushed our tactical advantage - into the dung pot. - I know. Yeah. She really has no reason to help us. I know! This jerky's terrible. I know! Are you sure those four miniature menaces will be successful? I don't know. Huh? Hmm? Huh? There's too much spice. Uh, no. There's too much bamboo. What do you know? You have the taste buds of a tall baby. Well, you dress like a tall baby. Give me the spoon! I'm taking over! Back off, tidal wave. I'm the professional here. May I? Whoa! That's good. It's just a little something my ba showed me. Aw. Did he also show you how to make that delicious jerky? No, that was all me. It'll be nice to share a meal with him again. I know what you mean. I have this really obnoxious sister who always tousles my hair. I can't wait to see her the most. After we win the day, I look forward to filling my eyeball with the joytastic image of my village full again. And you will be reunited with your family, Noi. Uh, what did you just call her? Noi. It's her name. It's written on her collar. Have none of you ever checked? And they think of me as the ruffian. What's that mean? It means we're on. Sisu, until we get that gem and confirm Namaari's actually on our side, promise me you'll stay hidden. I see you got my gift. I never thought I'd see this again. Well, uh... I tried to take good care of it. You're not the only dragon nerd here. The final piece. Time to bring everyone back. Sisu and the gem pieces are coming with me. - Sisu! - Stay back! It was foolish to trust someone from Fang! Don't come any closer! Namaari, it doesn't have to be like this. I don't have any other choice. Hey. I got this. I know you don't wanna hurt anybody. What are you doing? You just want a better world. Like we all do. Sisu... I trust you, Namaari. No! Sisu! No... What's happening? I don't know. It appears that with the last dragon gone, so too goes the water. Now there is nothing to stop the Druun. Nothing. Raya? Where's Raya? Namaari! Let's finish this, binturi. Raya! She cannot see us. Raya's blinded by her own rage. The gem's powers are fading! All these people are Druun food if we don't get them out. Come on! Trust me, it's gonna be okay. Stupid Druun! Out of my way! Go, go, go! Up we go! Yep! Go, go! Hurry! Get to the water! Keep going! Keep going! Come on! Come on! I never meant for any of this to happen. Liar! I don't care if you believe me. Sisu did. But you didn't trust her. That's why we're here. Do whatever you want. But you're as much to blame for Sisu's death as I am. Tong, there's still people back there! Hurry! We're running out of time! Got it! Everyone, out! Come with me! Okay, Tuk, these are the last of 'em. Go! We're right behind you. Tuk Tuk! What are you waiting for? Go! Raya! It's the one who slayed Sisu! Raya! Raya! The gem's magic, it's almost gone! They aren't backing off! They're everywhere! I don't know why they chose me. It could have been any of us. All I know is I trusted them, and they trusted me. And so... Everyone, give me your gems. We can still put it together. It can still work. Sisu's gone, Raya! We don't have her magic! It's not about her magic. It's about trust. What? That's why it worked. That's why we can do it, too. By doing the one thing Sisu wanted us to do. What my ba wanted us to do. To finally trust each other and fix this. But we have to come together. Please. After what she's done? We'll never trust her! Then let me take the first step. Raya! No! It worked! It worked! Tuk Tuk! Oh! Pranee! Amba! Jagan! Pengu! Yeah! Raya. Sisu. I am so hungry. I got some jerky. Not that hungry. Sisu! Aw, it's good to breathe in your glorious dragon stench again. Okay, I take that as a compliment. Momma! My baby! Mom, look, it's Boun! It's Boun! Ba? Dewdrop? Ba! Is that really her? Chief Benja, your daughter did you proud. Hope you don't mind, she brought some friends. Ba? Welcome to Kumandra.
