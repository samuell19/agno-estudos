(journalist): A movie actress and four of her friends were murdered. The circumstances were lurid. - The lawyer Paul Caruso said five people dressed in black entered Ms. Tate's home after cutting the power and telephone lines, and went methodically about the business of killing five people. Caruso represents Susan Atkins, a member of the gang or commune. He said she and the others were completely under what he called: "The insane influence of Charles Manson." (woman): You consider yourself a member of a religious order? - In a sense. Mm-hmm. (Manson): Believe me, if I started murdering people... ...there'd be none of you left. The mind that you live in, the thought that you live in... is a family. - You scared to die? - Sometimes I feel I'm scared to live. Living's what scares me. Dying is easy. (eerie music) - Oh, sh... - Whoa! Do not hurt him. Come on back, man! (shouting) - We just want to talk, man! - Come on! - Come on, man! (exclaiming and panting) - Ah! - That all you got? - It's not gonna hurt you. - No! No! No! (screaming) (shouting) - Come on! - Look at me! Look at me! (screaming) (screaming and shouting) - Charlie, you can't leave your sheep behind. You're the shepherd, you have to herd. You created this movement. You can't go. I don't want you to go. (thumping) Oh, my God, I'm gonna fucking kill this guy. Can you just cut the camera? - Yeah. Alright. (sighing) Should I call the landlord? - No, I've already called him, like, 20 times. - Okay. Do you want me to, like, go over there and talk to him? - No, Mitch. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. It's just... it's a really big callback. - I know. (thumping) - Fuck it. I'm gonna book a place. - Tiana, you really think the background's gonna make that big of a difference? - Baby, casting these days... I have friends who literally shoot on location and they book. I guarantee you if we shoot in the desert, it's gonna look that much better. Look. This place is perfect. It's 70 bucks. Give me half the day to shoot and I'm yours the rest of the weekend. - I still don't really get it, to be honest with you. - You don't get it 'cause it's arthouse. - Arthouse. Please. They're making Charles Manson look like a good guy. Don't see how that's arthouse. - No, I think the director's vision is he's trying to make him look like a prophet or something. You know, he's trying to show how his followers saw him before he died. - A prophet? - Yeah. Historically, they thought he was the second coming of Jesus. - Does the director have him walking on water too? Coming out of the grave? (laughing) (up-tempo music) (eerie music) - I lost my fiancé... Ben. It was last November. It was cancer. I know sometimes I feel like... I feel like it was my fault. You know, I feel like... I feel like I really could've just... - Could've what, Tiana? - I don't know. - It's natural to feel a sense of responsibility for the ones we lost. But the reality is... ...you don't control cancer. There's nothing you could do. - Mm, uh... (muttering) Nice little store you got here, my friend. Yeah, this is it for me, I... You got sunblock? - Yeah. And you know what? Ahem. This here's on the house. Gets real hot out there. And you need to protect that skin of yours. Keep that colour. Just about perfect. Hey, no drinks, but, uh... ...the locals are pleasant. (chuckling) You good? - Yeah. - You got the address? - Yeah. - Okay, that's where it is. Definitely seeing some drunk bowling tonight. What, just right here? - Yeah. - Fucking awesome. There's no service. I thought the ad said there would be internet. - Uh, would you hand me mine, actually? - What? - Nothing. Grace just wanted me to call her. I'm gonna have to head back into town and grab service. May as well grab us some drinks while I'm out? Actually, uh, you want to just come with? You know I suck at picking mixers anyways. - I'll be fine. Seriously, Mitch. (Mitch chuckling) - Well... groovy. - Thanks. - Alright. Everything's in the room. Last chance. - Strawberry. - Whatever. Alright, I'll be right back. (eerie music) I got your text earlier. What's going on? (Grace): Okay, don't freak out, but I can't come tonight. Judge finally granted us that warrant. - Grace. - Mitch, I'm sorry. I really am. It's just... Can I at least come tomorrow night or the night after instead? - Yeah. Yeah, look, just... just come tomorrow, alright? Fuck I... I forgot to leave your camera out for you. Look, the camera, it's in Tiana's desk, in her bedroom somewhere. Just grab it on your way. Her key's under the mat. (laughing) - You forget everything, you know that, right? - Grace, I... Have you ever heard of a... a snake eating itself... as a symbol or a tattoo, something? (chuckling) - Mitch, how about you just focus on your lady, okay? - Yeah. Thanks. (faint sound) - Mitch? Mitch?

T? - I heard you, Mitch. - Right, right, um... Okay. Uh... I mean, yeah, it's cool. I get it. Especially... everything that happened with Ben and... (country music playing) (hissing) (rattling) (country music playing) - Hey! Hey. What? You're gonna crush this, okay? I'm serious. No one deserves it more. Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Why do you want this one so bad? (fly buzzing) - In the script, Annie loses her family before she meets Manson. And it hurts her so bad, uh, she starts hurting herself. I know the script is silly, but I just... this role... ...it's me. - Well, I think that they would be fucking lucky to have you. Hey, uh, I'm gonna... gonna take a walk. You want to take a little break? - Sooner I get this done, the sooner I can kick your ass in bowling. - Good luck. I love you. - Love you. (soft music) - Maybe this could work. Yeah... What would you say? You just... Tiana Williams... ...will you... No, that's fucking lame. Well, uh... - Howdy. - Hey. What's up, man? - Just taking care of business. They're for a... rattle roundup. We sell the skins down in Indio. - That's cool. - You? - Uh, just a vacation. - Vacation. Vacation! Come on, man! I saw you up there practicing. (chuckling) Come on, let's see it. - You want to see the ring? - Today, junior. Come on. Damn... That's a nice rock. You must really love her, huh? - Thank you. I... I do. (chuckling) - She have any idea? - I don't know, man. I hope not. - I hope not! (laughing) I hope not. (laughing) (clearing throat) - What's in the jar? - Uh... ashes. Relative died recently. (hocking) - Oh, I'm sorry, man. That... Is that gravestone yours too? - Mm-hmm. Travis. - Yeah. - Yeah. Good pup, he was. Good pup. - Um... sorry to hear that. I hope you, uh, you find a good spot or... or... whatever, you know? - Hey! You ought to wear a hat around here. The sun, it'll, uh, darken up your face. A man only gets to propose once. - You know it, brother. Yeah. (chuckling) Hey, it was nice to meet you. - You take care now! - Yeah, you too, man. You too. (interviewer): Even though they have rebelled against that society? (Manson): Well, uh, who... They weren't born rebelling. They weren't born with, uh... The mind that you live in, the thought that you live in... ...is a family. Uh, uh, the anger and frustration that they have, that had to be put on them by somebody. Somebody created them. Uh, it's as if... if you're outside... ...and you live a life... ...on the outside. (eerie music) (Manson): He's lost sight of his children. He doesn't see in the back. He doesn't see in the shadows. - What are you watching? (interviewer): Do guys belong on a death row or a condemned row if there is such a row? - T? - I found it. - You found what? - I found a way in. Like, I already knew it, but to connect Annie, I... It's fire monk. - Hmm. Fire monk? - Ready to shoot? - Yeah, definitely. I just... want to get cleaned up first. - You have my permission. - Whatever. - Can you turn the AC on? It's fucking hot. - Yeah, one sec. Tiana... ...first time I saw you, I knew that I loved... No. Jesus, why is this so fucking hard? When I used to think about my wedding... ...well, I'd just get sad, because... ...all I could think about was how my dad wasn't gonna be there to enjoy it with me. But now all I see is... you walking down the aisle. (faint thumping) (rock music playing) Damn. - Have you ever heard of this? There's a monk from the '60s, he set himself on fire. He was protesting the corrupt government in Vietnam, and just a mere photo of the act revolutionized the world. - I'm sorry. Wait. Am I the fire monk here? - So... when are you actually gonna tell me your story? - I don't know. Haven't decided. - You're not comfortable yet? - No. Not really, no. That was just my first meeting. - I meant right now. - My dad... ...he was off-duty, driving me and my sister home in Virginia. We pull into the gas station. A couple kids run out, masked up. Dad tried to stop 'em. One of 'em had a Glock. What? - Thank you. - Thank you. Cheers. Mind if I sip on this one? I'd actually like to remember tonight. - Why is that? - Because I find you interesting. Yeah, and you have this, uh... fuck-off mentality, but once you get past that, you're really quite a charming person. - Are you flirting with me? - You want me to? (rattling) Holy shit! You actually pull it off, no lie. - You look handsome. - Mm. - Not a lot of fancy restaurants around here, though. - Yeah, just you. - You ready to do this? - Oh, yeah. I'll be out front. You really do look awesome. - Big black bug bit a big black bear, and the big black bear bleed blood. Big black bug bit a big black bear, and a big black bear bleed blood. Big black bear bit a big black bug and... - Fucking actors, man. - Big black bug bit a big black bear, and the big black bear bleed blood. This is my mark? - Yeah. Alright. Damn, you went in with the character prep. - Yeah, it was hard getting inside of Annie's head. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. - Alright. We are... rolling. - I'm getting tired, Charlie! - You can do it, Annie. Find your inner power. Robert, dump the body. Don't get queasy on me now, Annie. These politicians, they don't care. They don't care about you. - You care. - Amen. - What will do in the new world? - There's so much anger in this world, Annie, so much hate. The new world is all chill all day. The white way. Grass and ass, you dig? - Messiah. - Let me tell y'all, I'll be long gone before the new world, and it's up to you to complete the circle of life. Charlie's will is Man's son. - Charlie's will is Man's son. - Charlie's will is Man's son. - Charlie's will is Man's son! - Boom. Got it. - That felt good. - Yeah. What do you think? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, I dig that. - Me, too. I thought it was great. You want to do one more? - No. - No. - Good job. You really brought it out in me. - I guess so. - Let's get into the other scenes. - Yeah, go. - Was I right or was I right? - Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. It looks pretty awesome. (country music playing) (singing gibberish) - What's the matter?! Cat got your tongue?! Quiet now. Mm. (disturbing music) (exclaiming) - Alright, alright, alright. (groaning) There she is. Hey... I'm proud of you. - Okay, shut up. - No, I'm serious that... I mean it. That was really good work you did out there. I think you're gonna book it. I have a good feeling. - Okay. (both): Alright. - Tiana, you deserve it. Alright? You do. Come on, you do. - I was actually thinking about staying in character all weekend. - Fuck that. (chuckling) - You know Margarita? (sighing) - Yes, darling. - Bye, loser. - Extra tequila. Ah... Where's the ring? (slamming) (Tiana): Coming? You want lime juice in yours? - T, uh... ...you think we have any neighbours? (glass breaking) Fucking-- - I'm sorry. - What the fuck, Tiana?! - I-I'm sorry. (sighing) Are you okay? - Um... (coughing) Yeah. (sniffling) I'm good. - Okay, well, maybe we just stick to these? - Sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. It's just that, uh... I saw someone today... on my way back. - Did he talk to you or something? - He was burying one of his friends. - He was burying one of his friends? - His friend's ashes, but... but yeah, I mean... I don't know, it was weird. I think we should leave early. - What? Mitch, you're scaring me. What's going on? - I don't want to freak you out and I know I'm being paranoid, but when I went into the office earlier... one of the windows was open. - Mitch, I opened that window when I was studying. (laughing) - Tiana, don't laugh. Why didn't you tell me that earlier? - You want me to tell you every time I open a window? - Yeah, I do. Every time, every window, please and thank you. - What if it wasn't me? Someone else broke in. What would you have done? - I don't know. - No, come on, what would you have done? - I don't... I'm not in the mood for this right now, T. - Pussy. - "Pussy." Okay, I mean-- - Come on, what would you have done? - I don't know. I-I guess I would go to town and contact the police. - Oh, contact the police. That is every girl's dream. Come on, this is fun. What would you have done? Pressure's on. Save me, baby. - I... Alright, then I guess I would... I would just... murder the guy and we'd get into the car... be the next Bonnie and Clyde. Is that what you want to hear? - But what if I had ate all your candy on the drive and I was like fat and old, would you still love me, Mitchell? - Ms. Williams, I would love you even if you were the fattest and the oldest. I would die for you. - Don't say that. - Okay. Well, now I'm gonna say that all the time. (laughter) Come on. (eerie music) (ominous music) (music playing) (humming) (sighing) What? - Tiana? - Yeah. - Is the tile that interesting? - Sorry, just tired. - Hey, I saw your tape. You were awesome, even with your neighbours tapping on the wall. - Yeah. - Hey, what's up? You've been acting weird lately. - I'm fine. - Okay. Uh... So I've been thinking, Thanksgiving being in a couple weeks and all, um... I was hoping you'd finally come meet my parents. (disturbing music) - Mom? Dad? Mom? Dad? (moaning) - Shhh. You are very important. Do you know that? Yeah? Hey. Don't tell your mother. Okay? (intense music) - Mitch? (crickets chirping) (clanking) (clanking) (clanking) (muffled screaming) (muffled screaming) (man moaning) (clattering) (crying out) (clattering) Ben? Oh, my God! Oh, my God. What did they do to you? (muffled): You did this. Mm-hmm. (sniffling) - I thought you were dead. (grunting) I'm so sorry. (crying) (crickets chirping) What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Why didn't you tell me? - Charlie's vision. Dad dug Ben up... out the ground. (indistinct) Why isn't he out yet? D'you give him the sedative? (Tiana): I tried. I tried... I tried to give it to him. - Dad's losing patience. - Huh. - Holy shit, Mom was right. You do love him. You know what? Give me the GHB. - No. - I'll do it. - No! No, I-I'll do it. I'll do it, okay? I'll do it. - Better not fuck this up, T. (gasping) - Fuck! Fuck. Charlie! Charlie, what do I do? Please, what do I do? Can you please fucking help me? Please. Charlie, fucking help me. Fuck. What do I do? What... Cheers, Mitch. (panting) Fuck. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you.

Everything will be alright. Everything. Charlie... John. - Where the hell were you? - Ah, Tiana. We gotta go right now. - Where did you find that? (Mitch exclaiming) Mitch! - In a fucking RV half a mile away. Where is it, Tiana? Where is it?! - No, no. It's right here, sweetie. It's right here. (gasping) Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, you were right. There's somebody here. Yeah. - Okay. Alright. Fuck. Alright. Okay. - What is happening? - Oh, Jesus. What are you doing up? - Me? What are you... what are you doing outside, running around? Mitch? - We're leaving, right now. I was gonna propose tomorrow. My ring... it went missing yesterday. What the fuck is happening right now? (panting) I went out tonight to find it. I-I don't... What the fuck? - You... you were gonna... You were gonna... you were gonna propose? - I had a plan and everything. Whoever was back in the RV obviously fucking stole it. - - Mitch I... I don't... I-- - You don't what? - What else did you find? - Just a bunch of weird shit in your... your script and your... Fuck. And a bunch of pictures of you with other guys? Why would he have pictures of you? - It's my brother. - What do you mean, it's your brother? Tiana, you don't have a brother. I need to pull over. - Just speed up or he's gonna catch us, Mitch! Speed now or he's-- (shouting) Speed up! - Chill the fuck out! - Speed up! He's gonna catch us! - Fuck! - What? (high-pitched sound) - Got yourself another basket case at New Hope, huh? - What? - Poor bastard. - Travis? - Who else? - What is this? - Oh, this? Well... not sure. My guess is it's somewhere between the underworld and the overworld. So you think it's gonna work this time? - I don't know. - Do you want it to? (bang) (clattering) - She's alive! He ain't as bad off as you, but, uh... wouldn't exactly call him a... perfect vessel anymore. (chuckling) You know, part of me wishes you wouldn't have made it out here at all. You know, I do love you, sis. When they find out about this, though... You know... ...you got it easy. You know that? Living in L.A., dating guys like Captain fucking America here. You got it easy, you know that? - Why are you talking like this? Fucking just leave! - Because... I fucking... like it. I'm out here in the fuckin' desert, confined to a basement doing fucking science experiments, and you're the fucking favourite?! - Please, Lucas, please. Lucas. - No, no, no. You shut the fuck up, T! Left one in there for ya. When Charlie comes back tonight... ...I'm not gonna lie to him. I will pray for you, though. - Lucas?! (sobbing): Lucas! Lucas! Fuck. Mitch! Lucas! (Mitch): Tiana! Tiana, open... open the door! (Tiana): Go away. - Open the door. - Mitch, go away! Mitch, get out! Mitch, fucking leave. Get out, please. Not everyone can get over it that easily, okay? Get out, Mitch! Fucking say something! Do you want to say anything? Please? Fucking say something, Mitch! Get out! Get out! Go! Get out. (crying) (crying) Mitch! Mitch! (country music playing) (humming) - Ugh! (humming) (clatter) (lively country music) (sniffling) (grunting) (gasping) (Lucas gasping) (screaming) (grunting) - Okay. Okay. Oh, my God, please forgive me? Please? Come on, Mitch. Mitch, Mitch, get up, get up, get up. Come on, come on. We gotta get outta here. My family's coming. - Your family? - The family. We need to go right now. - You drugged me. - Fuck the drugs. - No, I'm not going. Tiana, I'm not fucking going anywhere! - I know you have no reason to trust me. I really need you to try. - Tiana, stop. What... What are you doing? - I'm buying you time. - Huh? Hey! Why me? Tiana, I asked you a fucking question, huh! You owe me that at least. - You're the perfect vessel, Mitch. - The perfect vessel? What are you talking about? (Tiana): My dad is their leader. They'll stop at nothing. They'll be here any minute. You have to get outta here. (Mitch): How could you do this to me? And you actually think... you can resurrect Charles Manson? (Tiana): You weren't the first one. The guy in the cage? It was Ben. Mitch. Mitch! L-l-leave. - Was any of it real? (brakes squealing) - You killed our son. (crying) (crying) (Robert): Get up. (crying): Dad. Dad, Dad, I tried to give him the GHB, but he caught on. He... he started hitting me and beating me and, Daddy, he stole the car and he killed Lucas! - Get up. Get up. - Dad, I'm sorry! - Get up. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the ritual and Charlie. I'm sorry... (Annie) Our son. You killed my son. You killed our son. - Annie. - You were never meant to play the part. - Annie, go wait outside. - ...not told you about the boy? - Go. - I told you about the boy. - Annie. - I told you about-- - Annie! - --the boy! - Go. Let me do this. - I love him, Dad. - I know. I know. (sniffling) (gulping) But what about your family? Our family. Your brother is gone. My son is dead. My son is dead. Tonight is the night, Tiana. Tonight is the night. Mitch is the vessel. You have committed a horrible, a horrible sin against our family. Against Manson. Do you understand me? Look at me. (Tiana sniffling) I've given you too much! Hope he forgives us. Pray he forgives us. (Tiana gulping) You give him a reason to. (crying softly) (howling) - Oh, oh, over here. What is that? Call him, Tiana. - Mitch. - I said call him loud. - Mitch, come on! Mitch, you're safe, baby! - Again. - Mitch! I don't know, he won't fucking listen to me. - You know, Charlie watches, he sees everything. You know that, right? Hey, Mitch! Come out! Sonofabitch. Gimme that gun. Hey, Mitch, I'm gonna give you 10 seconds, then I'm gonna blow her pretty little head off her skinny little body. - Dad-- - Mitch! Shhh. Don't speak. - Ten! Nine! I'm telling you Mitch, I'm not fucking around! Eight! Seven! Oh, fuck it. One! (Mitch): Okay, okay, okay, okay! - Go get... go get him! - Oh-ho! Bring him over here. Now, if you'd just done your job... - Oh, no, no, no. What the fuck happened to this guy, huh? - Nothing special. It's just some cuts and bruises. He'll be fine. You're the one. You the special boy. Come on, move. (soft, dramatic music) - Tiana, has he recited Charlie's will? - Yes. Yes, yeah. - Three times with vigour? - Yes, yes. (whimpering) - Are you sure you're committed to Charlie's will? (Tiana): Yes. - Then I think she's ready for the mixture. (groaning and whimpering) (muffled screaming) (whimpering) (muffled screaming) Shhh. Shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh... When Charlie wrote this in prison, I don't think he had any idea how dark the world would become. This X on my forehead signifies exile. Charlie was an exile. We're exiles... all of us. Cut off from the circle of life. But I got good news. Tonight... on the day of our lord's departure... ...we are gonna complete the circle of life. We are gonna take a day of sorrow and turn it into celebration. Tonight is the night of resurrection. Tonight we complete the cycle. (whimpering) Charlie's will is Man's son. (others): Charlie's will is Man's son. (Robert): Charlie's will is Man's son. (all): Charlie's will is Man's son. Charlie's will is Man's son. - Charlie's will is Man's son. Bring forth Charlie's ashes. (muffled exclamations) (groaning) (Mitch coughing) (coughing) (whispering voices) The mixture's working. Let's cut him down and put him in the box. Charlie's coming home tonight. Tiana... you did it, baby. You did it. I want you to stand with me, with us... your family. Tiana. - Robert. Robert. It's happening. It's happening. It's happening. It's happening. - Fucking pigs. (sirens wailing) (shouting) (man): Cops! (shouting) Boom! Go, get 'em! (shouting) - Weapons, weapons, weapons! (gunfire) (man): Go, go, go! (gunfire) (shouting) - Wake the fuck up! (gunfire) (man): Fucking pigs. - Go! Go get him! Go, go, go! (man): Ah! (gunfire) - Go, go, go, go! (sobbing) (man): Get off me! (shouting) Shit, get off me! - What the fuck, dude?! Get off him! (gunfire) (crying) - Please. (roaring) (crying) (laughing) Please. Please. - Tiana! (Tiana): Please. - Mitch? (Eric): That's when she, uh, she fell on the floor and, um... ...and I laughed, because I thought she was just kinda feeling it, you know? And, uh, I lay down next to her, because, you know, I thought we were just doing that, whatever, and she, uh... And then I just kind of... I watched her die. I fucking... Yeah, I was just... I was so high, I thought it was part of the trip. And... ...I literally watched her... choke on the floor right in front of me. You know, I just... I don't think I can... ...go on like this anymore. I wish it was me instead of her. Well... that's it. - Nothing's too big to be forgiven, Eric. Remember, tomorrow's a new day. - Hey. (sniffling) - Hey. - Thanks for sharing.
