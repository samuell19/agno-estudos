What do you think I'd look like with no hair? I don't know. You're pretty, so you could probably rock any style. Why do you ask? Just curious. Okay. - Have a good one. - All right. See you later. So what is identity? What are the values, the ideologies, and practices that make us who we are? You will write an essay about your identity and how you shape it. Who are you? How did you get that way? Be as specific as possible, no generalities. Tell me about a specific experience or several. Tahir. Tell us one thing about your identity. Pork chops. Amos, another disruption from you and you will be out of here. Sorry, go ahead, Tahir. My deen. Good. Will you tell the class what that is? The Islamic way of life. Amos, tell us one thing about your identity. Today, another round of US air strikes are helping to slow the advances of ISIS fighters in Syria. There's no word so far on military or civilian casualties at this time. Immigration continues to be a hot button. Today we'll see highs in the mid to upper 70s with just a few morning clouds that we see tapering off in the afternoon. It is maybe the perfect day for a picnic or an unplanned date. This week will be fairly similar with cool, dry mornings, a few clouds, that will taper off in the afternoons, leaving us with the perfect, sunny spring week. Back to you, Victor. Cut.

But seriously, what are we gonna do for the talent show? We gotta come tight this year. - I'll help choreograph. - Perfect. Yeah, me too. Why don't we leave the choreography for me and Blaine? We don't wanna end up like we did last year, you know? Yeah. There's no shame. No, but look, we'll meet up tomorrow. Work on the routine. We're gonna win this year.

Did you see this video of Ranelle? Yeah. I guess that's why she dropped out last year. I thought she was going to Community College, too. She does and I like some of these video, though. Bye. Hey, Mom, look at this video. Remember Ranelle from my school. Honey, I had the most magical night. I went to the mosque. You know the one my co-worker attends. They're about to ban those places, Mom. And I heard women have to sit in separate rooms. No, Summer, this was beautiful. I mean the people, the lights, the smell... The prayer. Any politician looking to ban that is an idiot. ♪ Best honey on the block ♪ This honey don't stop My identity is shaped by my parents. They come from two very different worlds. My father from a large family, my mother from a small, broken family. Because of that, she made her own way. Lives by her own rules. I do, too. My mother always says life is about growth, about reinvention. I like to switch things up, explore new styles, read new books. I dance because my grandmother danced. Movement is one of my only connections to my lineage. To my DNA. Mom, it's a sunny day today. Why are you wearing that? Because I want to. Why are you wearing that? You picked this top out for me, Mom. Yeah, but I didn't tie it up like that, Summer. Anyway, I was up late last night reading the Quran. I swear I've never - read anything-- - Okay, Mom. I'll see you later. Hey girl. Hey, what's up? I think my mom's on something. Like drugs? No. She went to this Muslim temple. It was weird. Damn, that's tough. You remember that Muslim bakery up in Englewood? Yeah. Yeah, my uncle got caught up in that. Turns out their leader had like 20 wives, 40 kids. All the women had to like walk behind the men and bake bean pies all day. Well, they say it was like corrupt. They was like killing Nigerians and journalists and then they was turned around and selling bake goods and shit. What? Yeah. So, where's your uncle now? Well, he went to jail and now he sells shoes up in Redondo Beach. He never was the same. Wow. But anyway, we about to ace this calculus test. You study? Yeah. Yeah, that's about the only thing there's time to do. I don't know what it means to be a believer. Growing up, we never went to church. I wanna be what my mother wants, but I'm scared of what I want. To be with someone, to feel, to touch them, to dream all at once. My mother comes home from themasjid, glowing in a light I've never seen. It's a Godly light. One I connect to. I wanna glow like her, but I already feel tainted. Full of a fire I can't put out. I'm sure many of us are aware of all of this turmoil and madness that has descended upon our nation and our world. And like you and myself, I sit at home and I wonder and I think about what can I do. What can you do? What can Jumu'do to relieve some of this pain? And I think about one of the five pillars of Islam which is zakat, charity. I'm sure many of us when we're walking down the street and we had a bad day and we're consumed with bills and problems and someone interrupts that thinking and they say, or they say hello, how are you, you look beautiful today. And all of a sudden that just changes your whole day. That may change your whole month, inshallah. You have a pep in your step now. You poke that chest out. That's a form of charity. That is Zakat. Salaam-Alaikum, Sister Jade. It was good to see you today. Good to see you, too. This must be your daughter. Yes, this is Summer. Salaam-Alaikum, young sister. Same to you. Please, excuse her. She is new to all of this. A new believer like me. Well this is a place for new believers. Those with love in their hearts, seeking truth. Yes, the truth. Well, I look forward to more truth next Friday. The truth is in you, sister. And in the Quran,. Well... Why don't you and Summer take home one of these bean pies. I don't do pie. Starch, you know. Thank you, Imam Khalid. It's very nice of you. - Have a good day. -You too, sister. Salaam-Alaikum, He's a nice way to get over Jordan. Don't you ever say that. I have to say it. We all know you wanna a cupcake. Not another word. Summer, put that back on. Why? We're leaving. Girl, do you think this is a game? I have finally found something that makes me happy and you wanna mock it instead of maybe learning something. Learning what? How to hide behind scarves and holy passages instead of just saying you wanna screw a man and finally be accepted for once. I don't wanna hear another word from you. You need to learn some respect. You need to be in the masjid every weekend instead of running around in the streets looking at stripper videos. It's art, Mom. It's trash, Summer. Now put it back on. Dinner is served. Thank you. I put extra bacon on there for you, Summertime. Thanks. Babe, you remember Cali from my Yoga class? Cal, yeah, sure. She's having a hip hop ballet performance tonight and I promised her I'd go. Hip hop and ballet, you must go. I'm gonna run. Bye, Jennifer. Do you wanna come, Summer? No, I'm good. Okay. Bye, Summertime. Thanks for the sliders, babe. You got it. Why did she call me that? No idea. - Good question. - Why? She tries stuff. Still worried about Mom? It's just a phase, Summer, it'll pass. I mean, your mother, she's always, you know she's discovering things just like your grandmother. When I met your mother she was a new age Black Panther and a Buddhist. - How does that work? - I don't know. I don't know. She's been doing the most, dad. I can't do anything without her spewing this religious crap on me. I don't know, you ever thought about maybe temporarily giving in? You know, maybe even learning about it? At least until you graduate and move out. You mean like converting to Islam? No. No, I mean, listen to your mom's preaching a little bit, stroke her ego. Maybe make some friends at the mosque.

It's discrimination. But I wanted to let you know that I'm sorry for the way I've been acting lately. I know Islam is special to you and I wanna try to embrace it.

They all influence our relationships with almighty Allah Angels are made of light. They have no free will. Their will is that of Allah. The Jinn, however, is made of fire. There are males and females living in another universe with free will. The Jinn, like us, choose whether to give in, to bow in adherence to disbelief or to accept the truth. To use their fire to burn or warm their worlds. So, what makes us different from Jinn? We are not born of fire, but of clay. We have free will, but with free will, humans can mirror the most evil of jinn. It's upon Allah. It is our task with Islam to resist that evil, to take the straight path. The path away from drugs, away from meaningless sex, away from ignorance and I know that's hard with social media and posting selfies every five minutes. It's tough for Allah. My teams know what I'm talking about. Right? Ranelle is in those leaps. I heard she got another video coming out next week. I'm taking the Shahada next Saturday. The what? It's like the official prayer you recite to become a Muslim. Wow. Okay. So, that's like official now? No turning back? No turning back. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I think you look cute in a scarf.

I cut their fucking tits. That's what we'll call you. My little Blaine. My little Blaine. What are you looking at? Not much. What's that supposed to mean, Malcolm X Junior? Was that supposed to be funny? I know you saw me at the mosque today. And now, you're drunk. Better not tell anyone you saw me here. No one at the mosque. Understand me? Yeah, sure. Hey, Blaine. Today, our young sister Summer will be taking her Shahada. There's no turning back from the truth. Just repeat after me. I bear witness. I bear witness. That there is no God but Allah. That there is no God but Allah. And that Muhammad. And that Muhammad. Is his messenger. That Muhammad is his messenger. Is his messenger. You know these were your dad's favorite. We couldn't go a week without him asking, when are you going to make the pancakes? Well, I'm sure he still wants some. Ew. All Jennifer knows how to make is sliders. She tried to make pancakes and they were all big and lumpy. One wasn't even done all the way. It was gross. I don't care what my family says. I've never felt this way about anyone. I understand. Love is very complex. I'm gonna be with her. I'm tired of meeting girls my father forces me to. Just because they are a good Muslim. Stacey may not be a Muslim, but she had a rough past, but I want her so bad. My dad say I need to marry somebody pure. Follow your heart, Jusuf. But be smart. Don't let your father dictate your life. Be with this woman. Bring her to our masjid, but know that things might not work out the way you have envisioned. If she doesn't convert Allah knows best. I'll speak to your father and help him understand. We still got to overcome that. You know the part. Good. We'll get it. So, how's the Muslim thing going? It's Muslim, Tati, not Muslim. I guess. You're not gonna wear that in the show though, right? What? My scarf? Yeah, your scarf. It's not sexy. You look like someone's substitute teacher. I know your mom is making you do this, but I wanna win. My mom is not making me do anything, Tati. Look, Imam says come as we are. I'm a Muslim, Tati. Yeah. And I'm a Jehovah's Witness. Just got back from knocking on doors this morning. That's not funny, my grandma's a Jehovah's Witness. I don't care. You can't just change your religion one day. It doesn't work like that. But you change football players every week, so what's really going on, Tati? That was cold, Summer. So is intolerance. She'll get over it. Well, I guess practice is over. Where are you going? To the skate park. I got 'em black and blue out there last week. Gonna kick, push, kick, push, coast. All right, bye. See you later. Shake it off. Five, six, seven, eight. Whoa, sorry. Catch you later, all right? Hey. You okay? Yeah, good. I know. I saw the picture you posted. Halal hottie. Yeah, that's a new one. Just being myself. Are you coming to Jumu'this Friday? Think so. Cool. Guess I see you there. I'll see you. All right, later. Hi, my name is Amina. Amina. Nice to meet you. My name is Mahasan. Means beautiful in Arabic. My name is Anisa. No, not Anissah. Anisa. Jade? No. My name is Anisa Mohamed. Pleasant companion. A name change? Jade, are you serious? Yes. Haven't you put Summer through enough and now, you wanna spring this on her in her senior year. I'm not springing anything on her, David. I introduced her to the truth. No, it is your truth, Jade. It is your truth. You know why things didn't work out between us, because you keep switching things up and keep changing. You cannot build a life like that. What did I tell you about the bean pie? No, stop it. These are beautiful, right? What do you think about this? I can rock it. Yeah. I think you could. I'll take this one. Anything else? No, just that today. You know, you always get my money. I'll be back. Salaam-Alaikum, sister Jade. Hey, Tahir. - Hey. - How are you? Good, how are you? Good. Good. Did you enjoy Jumu' Yeah. - You? -Yeah. Yeah. It was awesome. It was very cool. So, about that hang? - Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Pizza? - I love pizza. - All right. Very good. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I just remembered that the storm is coming, so... Not bad. Told you. These pepperonis no joke, man. How would you know if you've never had the real thing? I mean, who defines what's real? So, what's with this whole Muslims can't eat pork thing? Pigs are unclean animals. They can give you worms. Aren't all animals unclean? I mean, have you smelled those cows on the side of the freeway when you're coming up the Bay on the five? They smell like hot ass. I literally throw up in my mouth when we're passing them. And here we are. Eating all those same old stinky cows. I mean, we're eating halal cow. I mean, we pray over it, dance light. Interesting. You're mom cool with you being here? I told her I was hanging out with some friends. Why lie? Because if she knew I was corrupting some Muslim boy and ruining her reputation at the masjid, she'd have a fit. So, you're corrupting me? What did you tell your parents? Hanging with you. What? They're surprised. I just thought Muslims can't really do this kinda thing. Like what kinda thing? You know. Hanging out with someone of a different sex. Eating beef pepperoni on paper plates. You know what I mean. My folks are super cool, Summer. My mom does hair in Englewood and my parents met at a club. I told them I'll bring you by later. Wow. I think I want another one. Damn, girl. Really, I love pepperoni. I can see that. Let me hook you up right quick though. - Okay. -You have to put a little bit of this on there. Try that.

Okay. One moment. So, how do you know we're not Jinn? What do you mean? Like we could be living in a parallel universe and not even know it? Allah knows. He gave us the Quran, so we know. But I thought there was different types of Jinn. Yeah, I mean, there's Sila, usually women, intelligent shape-shifter. Like me So, have you been Muslim since you were born? Yeah. Gosh. What was that like? I guess it's like everything else. I don't think about it much. Do you ever get scared? Scared of what? I heard about the mosque being torched in Lancaster. I don't know.

Yeah. Wow. And this, hey, this is my dad, Dawud. Would you like some bean pie? No, we just had churros. Thank you, ma'am, but I... Who are you calling "ma'am"? And no one refuses Dawud's bean pie. It's like 10 times better than the one at the masjid. And you're honest. Come have a seat. So, Summer, your mom is new to the masjid, correct? She is. She loves it. They can't get her to take off her scarf. How do you feel about it? It's cool. I mean, it's a new religion. Learning a lot more than I ever have. Like beef pepperoni. You took her to Muhammad Mega Pizza Grill. Yeah. That's my boy. See, the one way to a Muslimah's heart, beef pepperoni. Stop it. You two are just friends, right? Yes, Miss Rasheedah. - Don't worry. - We won't. You can go upstairs if you like unless you wanna watch your father's team lose. I take great joy in that. Let's go. Summer, I live with a family of traitors. Traitors, my ass. I'm from the Bay anyway. Dub nation. Common man. Your team ain't going nowhere. - Yeah. - But home. Okay, so you win the award for the coolest parents ever. I can't believe they let us up here. Why wouldn't they? Yeah. Why wouldn't they? We're two upstanding students. What could we possibly doing in this room other than studying? You heard back already? No, it's just some letters about possible scholarships. That's good. I haven't heard shit. No? Don't wanna end up like Ranelle. That's not funny. I'm serious. I'll be... She's like famous now. She's making serious money, I heard. Come on, Summer, you're not gonna be like Ranelle. I mean, unless you keep posting those halal hottie pics on Instagram, I don't know. It looks like you started a movement. I should go. But thank you for today. The pepperoni. I'll see you later. Yeah. O Allah, I ask You, of Your Knowledge, for guidance and of Your power, for strength, and I ask You of Your excessive generosity. Certainly You are powerful and I am not. And You are the Knower of the unknown. If you know this matter to be good for my religion, my worldly life, my life in the next world, my present state of affairs or my future state, then decree it for me and make it easy and bless me in it. And if You know this matter to be detrimental to my religion, my worldly life, my life in the next world, my present state of affairs or my future state, then divert it from me and turn me away from it and decree from me that which is good wherever it may be. And then make me to be pleased with it. I think she's a Muslim now, yeah. Changed her picture on Facebook last night, caused a whole shit storm of comments. I think she looks much prettier, personally, with curly hair. I think they call it a weave or something. Do you all need something? You'd think I got a nose job with all the attention. - We're on in five. - Great. Jade, you sure you wanna do this? What's... My God. Hey guys. Damn, Summer. I didn't know you got down like that. Like what? Tati, are you still mad from the other day? I think it's time to get over it. If I was you, I'd be trying to get away before my Muslim mom sees this. Are you gonna delete your accounts? It doesn't matter. It's too late. The photos everywhere. You're a hashtag. Yeah, I kinda like it. We're in a very strange time. Everybody wants to be seen. Everybody wants to be liked and approved of. Vanity, glamour. Fame can come right through a cellphone screen. It's important for us to understand that Islam is not for show. It is not to be performed for approval, for validation. I see some of my young Muslimahs flaunting their bodies and using Islam as a way to be liked. Stop for Allah. As if showing your skin wasn't enough. What did you do? But, let's not place blame on that young person. Rather we live in a society that promotes vanity as a means for survival, but I say to you, young woman, stop. The last stop before your photos become actions and the truth that you sought here in this masjid becomes the fire. It's some Jinn burning. No, I am sorry, Imam. Summer is just a teenager. Okay, this, I promise, will never happen again. I understand, and... I didn't want to make it public, but the photo was everywhere. Someone emailed it to me. God. Most of the people inside, they knew what I was talking about. It's a bad representation of our masjid especially now, with all the bad press on Islam as it is. Salaam-Alaikum, Imam. - Jade. - Anisa. Sorry. Imam, what you did up there today was unacceptable. How could you target a young teenage girl in front of everyone? You could've pulled her aside afterwards. Sister Salam, I was only trying to help her. By persecuting her? Telling her she's going to hell for posting a photo? What hell is that? Listen, Rasheedah and Imam, I truly appreciate your concern, but Summer is my daughter and I will handle this. Thank you. You will not be needing that. Now come on. What the hell were you thinking? I swear I finally, finally found a place that I like and you try to ruin it. I didn't know this would happen, Mom. Really? Let's see. "Halal hotties make me hard" from g1zlod. "Halal hotties on top" from man Arab. "Halal hotties united" from jaron22. You are a disgrace. I remember hearing my mother cry in the bathroom and smile and laugh at breakfast with my father as they ate pancakes. This is her encore performance. I'm becoming someone I don't know. My mother is becoming someone I don't know. At the masjid, I love the way scarves feel on my skin until I get the urge to cut them up, make them into wings. Maybe, I was born in two bodies with one soul. I can't perform one way of being. Society made me this way. She made me this way. I cannot be bound. Let there be no compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error. Whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah have grasped the most trustworthy handhold that never breaks and Allah heareth and knoweth all things. Put this on. And you're not performing in that talent show. But I've been practicing for months. I don't care. Who knows what in the hell you and your friends got planned for that talent show. Probably a teen pole dancing routine. We're dancers, Mom. I'm going to school for dancing. You can't do this. I can and I will. And I don't wanna see you talking to that boy Tahir. And have a good day at school. Allah be with you. Hey. Hey. Did your mom freak out? She said I couldn't go perform in the talent show anymore. That sucks, but the Summer I know, would never let anyone, not even her own mother stop her from dancing in that show. Come on, cheer up. All right, let's go again. Five, six, seven, eight. Tati, stay in your lane, what are you doing? Once my girl, now my rival, I guess. Cute, you guess, all right. Okay, Tati. Watch your mouth. Ain't that what got you on lock down rocking sweat pants and Kmart shirts? I'd rather be wearing Kmart shirts than behind K hall pulling my jeans down for football players. Get out of my face! No, I'm not doing this shit anymore. Come on, Blaine, let's run it again. How the hell are we supposed to perform now, Summer? Easy. We perform. We're not going to let some slut outshine us. Let's go. You know that wasn't right, Summer. You know Tati isn't a hoe. She was. Whatever, man, I'm out. I've got this identity, I say the right things. Summer, are you okay? Hey. Your parents probably hate me, too. Mom defended you, Summer. Really? Yes. We should hang out at your house tomorrow. Yeah. But my parents won't be there. So what? We could have the whole place to ourselves. I don't know. Summer. What? You scared? I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Yes! So you, um, thinking about going back to the masjid? I think my mom would kill me if I didn't. But what do you want? Pepperoni pizza slice. For real, Summer. You. I... I want you. You probably say that to everyone. And who is everyone? I don't know. Those girls that send you text messages-- And letters during class. I don't know. You wanna know something? I have never been with anyone... Ever. The Instagram, the flirting... It's just something to do. So... Am I just something to do? No. You're perfect. Your family, your life. I just wanna break you, but gently. I'm not who you think I am, Summer. Most days I don't like going to the masjid. I think Imam Khalid is a creep. Tell your mom to watch out. My God. I knew I sensed some creep factor in him. My family is cool, but we have problems, too, you know. My dad tried to get a second wife four years ago. My mom wasn't having it, so she separated from him. Now they're trying to get back together and things are kinda just getting back to normal. You know? Wow. Yeah. What about you? What about your dad? He lives in Studio City. Okay. With a white woman. Okay. She's okay. I guess. All she knows how to make is sliders. My mom really never got over it. It's okay. ♪ Come to me ♪ Come to me ♪ Come to me Good morning. Hi, I'm Melissa.

Do you think this is a game? I lost my family, Summer. To this day, they won't speak to me because I'm a Muslim. My own parents. And you come over here and play with this like... I need it, too. Please. We welcomed you into our home. - Why? - Because we want each other. We both want each other. And a religion can't stop that, I'm sorry. But it won't. I love him. I'm gonna call your mother, Summer. Who knows what else you guys have been up to. You can go. I'm sorry. You can go. Really, Tahir? Really?! Summer. Summer. So, you wanna live here for the rest of your senior year? What about Jennifer? What about Jennifer? Hey. You are my daughter. Okay? Your mom's on her way. What?

I'm all right. You guys ready? Yeah. Let's go. ♪ Sang a lullaby ♪ To a butterfly ♪ Child's wide brown eyes ♪ Secrets inside ♪ She said when I die ♪ Become a butterfly ♪ You can flutter and color in meadows and hills ♪ ♪ Beauty gave me the chills ♪ Flyin' on your own ♪ Then a thousand mourn ♪ Bright white, emerald green ♪ Silk blue, sailin' seas ♪ And the spotted wings ♪ Go blow in the wind ♪ Bright white, emerald green I'll recite a poem for you guys? Yes. Yeah. I am smokeless fire. I'm a smokeless flame born to an unknown mother. She looks for God in me, but cannot find him. I look for God in me, but I can't find him. They call them Jinn. Not people or angels, beings with free will to do evil or good. My mother throws God at me, but I was born a smokeless fire. She was born of clay. I may never see my mom again. She disappeared in a holy book for another day. Thank you. Hello. Salaam-Alaikum, Anisa. Rasheedah. Are you okay, sis? No, I'm fine. What's up? Summer and Tahir. They've been-- What is it? What did they do? Just take care of yourself, sis. You're tough, baby, you are. It's your mother. What is she doing here? Just tell her what you told me, okay? - Hey. - Hey. Thank you. Summer? Yeah, get you right here. Thank you. I'm not going back to that masjid. Me neither. I have to find a new one. I know what you did, Summer. What did you do? I... I was with someone. A boy, and... Why didn't you come to me, Summer? You were busy, Mom, being a Muslim. You are my daughter. And I am never too busy for you. Look, I had you when I was way too young and I don't regret that for a second, but I would never want you to go through what I went through. So... I just hope that... You used protection. We did. And that you wanted to. I did, Mom. Okay. I should go. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. No. - I gotta go, David. - Jade. - She needs you. - No, she doesn't. We need you. Hey, you did good. Thank you for coming. I just don't know. No, it's okay. My God. Yes. My God. - What's wrong? - I got in. I got in. My God. Okay. That's my girl. That's my girl. I'm so proud of you. Hey, Jade, you should check this out. Wow. That's pretty great. Yeah. Well done. Thanks. You better not forget about me, Tahir. How can I forget about you when I'm the one that introduced you to beef pepperoni pizza? You owe me. How are your parents? They're good. Gosh, I miss them so much. My mom kinda misses you too. She just wants me to go to college without having a kid first. Nothing personal. How is your mom? She's good. She's attending another masjid in Englewood. Going on the occasional date. Having a beer. She's doing her own thing. How are you? I'm just happy to be free. Well, how about we go get some free beef pepperoni pizza slices? But we gotta get churros first. You're so bad for me. I know that's why you love me. Now, I know we've been experiencing some pretty gray days these past few weeks, but we do have a warm front sweeping into our area in the last few weeks of our spring. Summer, my favorite season, is on its way.
