(pensive music) (knock at door) - Yeah? - It's Danny, open up. Hi, bro. How you doing? What are you doing with that fucking thing? I told you to leave it at home. Knowing you, you'll blow your balls off. - Hey, man, having all this coke around makes me nervous. - Well, I can understand that. - Well? - We're rich, little brother. You did good. - All right! There's trouble though. - What kind? - The word's out. - What do you mean, "the word's out"? - This much doesn't blow into town unnoticed, you know. - Shit. We can't afford to sit on it, you know that. - It's too hot for us to take it out now. - Not us, little brother. Remember, I've got my little sweetheart along. - You're gonna let Elizabeth carry your stuff? - Why not? With an angel face like that, no cop in the world would ever dream that that little ski bunny was, um, carrying her own snow. (soft music) - Hi. - Well, hi yourself. - You know, it's such a shame we have to leave tomorrow. I'm having such a wonderful time. - It's just the beginning, babe. (Elizabeth chuckles) - I am so happy. - I am so glad. - You know, it's been a long time since I've had anyone like you to look after me. - I know. You know what's wrong with you? - What? - Nothin'. (smooth jazz music) - You two go ahead, I'll bring the skis. - Okay, be careful. Oh, here. - What? - Got your ticket? - Mm-hmm. I wish I could stay with you and Chris. - I've already told you, we're gonna be so busy you wouldn't have any fun anyway. Come on. - Have a good trip. - Thank you. - Thanks a lot. - I'm gonna miss you, you know. - You are? - Yes. - Well, I'm gonna miss you too. But it'll only be a couple of days, and I'll call you the minute I get back, okay? - I love you. - Everything's checked. - All right. - Have a nice trip, Liz. - Thank you, Chris. - Better get going. See you in a couple of days. - All right. (smooth jazz music) - [Cop] Step back, please, step back. Police. Stand back. - You have the right to remain silent. Everything that you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, we'll provide one for you. Do you understand these rights? These your skis? A dog sniffed out this cocaine in the baggage room. You're in a lot of trouble, Ms. Demming. (knock at door) - Cocaine? What are you talking about? - Mrs. Miles is going to search you. Then we're gonna go downtown. - But I haven't done anything wrong. - Yes, you have. You've been caught. (cuffs rattle) - Take off your clothes. I said take off your clothes, now. Quickly. (tense music) - Take her down and book her. Maybe some time in jail will make you want to talk. - Who do you think she's covering for? - Some punk, like always. (ominous music) (lock buzzes) - Demming, Elizabeth S. (sinister music) Step out now. Dry yourself. Good. Get dressed. (camera shutter snaps) - Take some advice, we have our own set of rules in here, and the quicker you learn 'em, the better off you're gonna be. - Hi, baby. Are you okay? - No! You gave me the drugs to carry! - Wait a minute. That was all a big mix-up. I was supposed to carry those skis. You got 'em by mistake. - Why? - Honey, for the money. For us, so we could get married. - (sobs) Danny, I can't stand it in this place. - Just try not to worry, okay? You're not gonna be in here very long, I promise. Now, you, uh... You didn't tell anybody about me, did you? That's my girl. I love you. - I love you too. - Hey, listen. I got you a really, really good attorney and he's gonna get you the hell outta here, I promise you. Just keep quiet about me and Chris, because if we're jail too, we couldn't help you very much, now could we? Trust me, okay? - I do. - I couldn't hear you. What'd you say? - I'm scared. - Look, I know you're scared. You're just gonna have to hold on for a little while. I'm sorry I got you mixed up in all this. We'll be together soon, really. Honey, I love you so much. (ominous music) - [Judge] Elizabeth Susan Demming, you have been found guilty of one count of transporting narcotics across an international boundary, and one count of possession of narcotics with intent to sell. Your lack of cooperation during these proceedings leaves me no alternative but to sentence you to one to three years in the correctional institution for women. (gavel bangs) - Sit here. - Demming, Elizabeth S. (camera shutter snaps) (tense music) - This is quarantine, you're here two weeks. Keep your nose clean or I'll bust your ass. Got it? - Yes, ma'am. - "Yes ma'am, no ma'am." "Yes, motherfucker ma'am." What kind of a jive bitch are you? What's up with that "ma'am" shit? - You're in prison now, girlie. No "ma'ams" in here, just us bitches. - My name is Elizabeth. - I'm Cheeks. This is Spider. - Hold on, bitch. I'm not gonna eat ya. Or maybe I am. What kinda good shit you got in there? (Elizabeth grunting) - Would you watch it? Girl. (ladies shouting) You're messing up my game! - Trouble already? - She started it! - Sure she did. - I didn't do anything! - Let's take a little walk. (ominous music) - Nobody likes a rat. (knock at door) (lock buzzes) - This is Demming. Five minutes in quarantine and already in trouble. - You didn't even make it to the file cabinet yet. Take off her cuffs. Wait outside. Sit down. Elizabeth S. Demming, age 22. No immediate family, sentence one to three years. Narcotics. You don't look like the type. - I'm not. - You're here. You're the type. Now, what's the trouble between you and Eyes? - Somebody tried to take my things. - There's one thing you'd better learn fast. You've got nothing anymore. No clothes, no rights. You're here for discipline. That's my job. You're no longer a citizen of the United States. They didn't want you. They gave you to me. Doesn't matter to me whether you're innocent or guilty. You're in prison. That makes you guilty. If you weren't guilty when you came in, you're guilty now. You understand what I mean, don't you, Demming? - Yes... Yes. - Good. Now, to your little infraction of the rules. Since this is your first night, we can afford to be lenient. I can afford to be lenient. No commissary privileges, no mail, no phone calls, no visitors. For one month. What's the matter? Seems too harsh to you? - Yes! - Good. (lock buzzes) Eyes, get her out of here. - It makes me look bad when someone in my block acts up. I don't tolerate that shit! (Elizabeth grunts) Straighten up. Straighten up, I said! Good evening, Mrs. Meyers. - Good evening. Is Warden Fletcher in her office? - Yes, ma'am. Come on, Demming. (door clangs) (knock at door) (lock buzzes) - I was just at the infirmary. A girl down there had heroin in her blood. She got it on the inside. - If somebody wants something badly enough, they'll find a way to get it. - That's not good enough, Fletcher. - What do you want me to do, nursemaid every prisoner? - It's your job to take care of the inmates. - That's right! My job. - You don't do your job worth shit. Look at these letters. More complaints from inmates' family! There's more going on here than a three-ring circus. - Don't you know when you're being hustled? Nobody cons like a con. - I've been working with convicts longer than you have. There's something rotten going on here. I can't put my finger on it, but I sure can smell it. - I'll tell you what's going on here. We punish criminals. Everybody sends their bad little girls to me, and when I try to discipline them, you tie my hands. I know my job. - Even if a person commits a crime, they're still a human being. It's your job to treat them that way. It's my job to see that you do. (pensive music) (inmate sobbing) (inmate sobbing) - So I said to this creep, "Rocky, you either split the fucking $10 with me or I'm gonna break your fucking skull." - So what happened? - I broke his fucking skull. Then there was this one dumbshit, Larry. What a body. He tried to run off with my stereo. - What'd you do? - I broke his fucking skull too. So I told Jerry that is the way it was, you take it or you leave it. - What'd he do? - He broke my fucking skull. - All right, ladies, pack your shit. Quarantine's over. You're going to the dorm tonight. (ominous music) - Cat, I don't wanna bother you, but- - It's been taken care of. - Thank you. (pregnant inmate exhales) - And release. - How's your little monster? - He's trying to break out. - What else is new? - Cat? I got some money for you. - Thanks. - It's 20 short. - You have garbage detail on Friday, right? Pick up my package and we'll call it even. - Miss Cat! Lady! Lady! Last night, I saw you in a dream. - What kind of a dream? - An omen dream. Sit. There was blood mixed with water. Someone meant you harm. - You know I'm not afraid of anybody. - You cannot wash away blood. - [Eyes] They're all yours. Watch this one. She's a real troublemaker. - All right, let's go. Empty beds at the end of the dorm. (ominous music) - I see that look in your eyes, Miss Cat. That girl is trouble. - You know, sometimes your voodoo bullshit is a pain in my ass. - Margo wants to talk to you. - That new cherry is something else. - I heard a story about her. - Oh yeah? - She got old Eyes on her back first night in quarantine. - Pass the word. No rough stuff with her unless I say so. I want her clean. Got it? - You're the boss. - Here. I had an extra pack. - All right, 10 o'clock, lights out. New girls, get your shit settled fast. No movements after lights out. (pensive music) (bedsprings creak) Come on! Move it! Let's go! Up! Move it! Outta bed! Come on! Up! - [Inmate] Keep it moving. - Excuse me. - You're a first-timer, aren't you? - Is it that obvious? - Mm-hmm. - Nobody says "excuse me" around here. What are you in for? - Something I didn't do. - There's an original line. Well, you look like a good kid. You'll get out, if you keep your nose clean. - I'm going to. - Good luck. Tough place to stay clean. It's all right. Just do what I do, you'll see. - Hi, Margo. Who's your little friend? - She's nobody, Cat. - I can't believe that. Are you nobody, or somebody? - My name is Elizabeth Demming. - Well, I think I'm gonna call you Cherry. That fits, don't you think, Margo? - Aw, lay off, Cat. She's a clean kid. - Nobody's clean in here. Are they, Margo? - They can try. - About that little commissary package. - Well, uh, the money didn't come yet, Cat. - Make sure it does. Or your old ass is mine. Bye, Cherry. - Who was that? - That, my dear, was Cat. If you wanna stay clean, you stay away from her. Everything bad that happens in this place, she's a part of it. - Is she a trustee or a prisoner like us? - Oh, she's a prisoner all right, but nothing like us. Cat can have anything she wants. She can do anything she wants, except get outta here. Doesn't matter if you don't like it. You'll get used to it. (tray clatters) - Watch your fucking step, Maharishi. - It was you who bumped into me. - You calling me a liar, you white-sheeted spook? - One more word and you die. - There a probably, Drums? - Is there? - No. Everything's just great. - Just a minute. (Drums snaps fingers) - The Black Muslim sisters. They don't cuss, they don't fool around. They don't even do drugs. But you cross 'em wrong, and you're dead. - Hi. - Hi. - How long did Breaker stick you in here for? - One month. - I wouldn't worry about it. You seem like a pretty smart kid to me. - If I was smart, I wouldn't be in here. - Tell you what. How 'bout if I get you a job working in the laundry? It's not the greatest, but it sure beats scrubbing toilet seats. - How could you do that? - People owe me. I like you, Cherry. You start on laundry detail tomorrow. - Thank you. - It's okay. Maybe someday you can do something for me. (ominous music) (tense music) Hi. - Hi. - Do you like candy? - Yes. - Here. I have an extra. - Thank you. By the way, you were right. I start laundry detail tomorrow. - Oh, that's great. - I appreciate it, Cat. - It's okay. Listen, if ever you need anything, you be sure and come to me, okay? - I will. - I hope you mean it. (pensive music) - Cat likes you. That may not be so good. - What do you mean? - Cat's the queen. She does you a favor, you owe her one. Her favors can be real hard to pay back. - You're trash detail tomorrow. Be waiting. - Who was that? - Icy. Cat doesn't like to get her hands dirty, so Icy takes care of things. (washers humming) (suspenseful music) - Okay. (bell clanging) - It's lunchtime, Demming. - I need more soap. - The back room, but make it fast. Please, Cat. Please. - Come on, Margo, you know the rules. - Give me a chance, Cat. I'll get the bread. - Aw, you're too deep in debt already. It's a shame too, isn't it, Icy? We just got some new stuff. - Please, Cat. I'm already getting the shakes. - Tough shit, Margo. No money, no privileges. - Dammit! You gotta help me! - Cat don't got to do a damn thing she don't want to. - You'd make me go cold turkey in this place? I'll tell everything I know. - Really? - Cat, you give me a fix. You give me a fix, Cat, or so help me God, I'll spill my guts about you! - All right, Margo. Icy, give her a blast. For old time's sake. - Thanks, Cat. Thanks. Hurry! I'll get the bread, Cat. Come on. Hey. Hey! That's nothing but air! - You get what you pay for, Margo. (muffled screaming) (ominous music) (Margo grunts) Hey, Icy. Margo don't look so good. (laughs) (sinister music) Boy, am I hungry. (knock at door) (lock buzzes) Good afternoon, Ms. Fletcher. - Leave us alone. - Yes, ma'am. - What happened to Margo? - Um... I give up. - Don't give me that bullshit! She had tracks in her arm. Did you kill her? - What difference does it make? - You can't embarrass me like this! That bitch Shelly Meyers is crawling all over my back. If inmates start turning up dead, she'll have my ass. - Business is business. Margo was slipping. - Margo's been here a long time. She had respect. Power too, once. - Had. - Our little arrangement has been very profitable. Don't fuck it up. (Kat clucks) (pensive music) - We didn't see you at dinner. Where's the shit? - I looked for ya. I had detail. - Well? - Here's the towel you lent me. Thanks. What's the matter with you? - I'm not feeling very well. - Did you hear about Margo? - What? - She's dead. - What happened to her? - Heart attack or something. Margo used to be like Cat, the queen bee. - How do you get to be queen bee? - By walking through hell and pissing on the devil. - Hi, Cherry. Did you pick up the garbage? - Yeah. - Good. What's wrong, Cherry? - Uh, I'm not feeling well. - Oh, I'm sorry. How do you like your new job? - It's okay. - Listen, Cherry. I like you a lot. I could take care of you, make life real easy for you. I want you to belong to me. - I don't want to belong to anybody. (sinister music) - You don't understand how it works on the inside. Everybody belongs to someone. Try scrubbing toilets again. Maybe that'll give you some perspective. - I got the package. What's the matter? - Cherry. That little bitch. I am gonna bust her ass good. By the time I'm through with her, she's gonna be begging for my help like everybody else. - [Breaker] Lights out! No talking! - Get that package weighed at the infirmary. I want to know just how much Sweets took. - Okay. - How do you like being back on toilets? - It's not too bad. - You got a lot to learn, Cherry. - I've got a transport slip. - This time of night? - For Rita Newman. - Newman to the front. (lock buzzes) - Let's go. - Go with him. (mother moaning) - Stop! Let me go! (ominous music) - Get undressed. We don't have much time. - No, Stone. - Cat says you're in some porno movies. I never made it with a movie star. - Fuck off, Stone! (spits) (Stone laughing) - No! Stone, stop it! Stop it! (Stone laughs) - Oh god! It's coming! The baby's coming! - Oh my god! - Oh my god! Ow, it hurts! - Stone, don't! Please don't! (Stone laughing) - Oh god, help me. Help me. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Stop it. - Shut up. - No! (mother screaming) - There, there. - (screaming) I can't! - Please stop. Please, Stone, please. - Not just yet, not just yet. Come on! (mother grunting) - Come on, baby. - Oh, god! - Push! Push! Keep pushing. Breathe. - I can't do this! I can't! - Yes, you can! - Oh my god! (Rita sobbing) (Stone grunting) - [Stone] Come on, come on, come on! - Come on, baby. - Yeah! Yeah! - Stop it! Stop it! (mother screaming) (Stone grunting) - No, please stop. (mother screaming) Stop! Stop! (mother screams) (Stone laughs) (sinister music) (Stone shouting) (mother panting) - No! Stop! (mother shrieks) (Stone moaning) (Rita screams) (mother shrieking) (Stone laughing) (Rita screaming) - [Inmate] It's coming! (Stone moaning) (mother yelping) (Stone laughing) (Rita sobbing) (baby screams) - It's a boy. (inmates cheer) - I don't know what's the big deal. You're the worst fuck I ever had. - All right, on your feet. Surprise inspection. - Good evening, ladies. Is that your dresser? - Yes, ma'am. - Don't "ma'am" me. One month in the hole. - No, please! - Don't ever talk back to me! - Please! No! Don't put me in the hole! No! Help me! Help me! No! No! (sobbing) No! Help me! Help! No! No! (sobbing) - Sleep well, ladies. - No! - If you can. (screams fading) (ominous music) (Sweets grunting) - No! Not in there! (Sweets screams) - Come in, Ms. Demming. I'm Carol Davies, your parole case worker. This is Mrs. Meyers, deputy director of the women's program. - Am I up for parole? - No, this is just an interview. - Have a seat. - It's my job to see that the prisons in this state are properly managed. I investigate complaints. Sometimes I just investigate. - Have there been some complaints about me? - Oh, no, nothing like that. I just want to ask you a few questions. We're looking into the death of Margo Diamond. Did you know her? - Yes, sort of. - I see here that, um, you were on laundry duty the day she died. Did you see anything you want to tell us about? - No, um... I was in the storeroom getting some soap. By the time I got back, the guard had already found her. - I think Margo Diamond was killed. What do you think about that? - I'm a prisoner just like Margo, Mrs. Meyers. I don't want to think about it. (pensive music) (Cheeks grunting) (inmates chatting) - It's that time, Marcy. - What time? - Favor time. You owe me one. - What are you talking about? - Well, everybody owes favors. I owe Stone two. One is Rita, and one is you. - What do you mean? - Stone plays rough, but at least he can stick it in. - I can't do that! - You fuck who I tell you to fuck. - Well, fuck you! (inmates fall silent) I'm sorry, Cat. - I'm sorry too, Marcy. (brooding music) (woman screams) (woman screams) - Oh, please, Icy! I told Cat I was sorry! (Marcy sobs) - This is for Stone. Cat wants you to have it. (Marcy wails) Next time Cat tells you to fuck someone, you fuck him! (muffled screaming) (Marcy grunting) - [Marcy] No more! - Cat'll be glad to know you're sorry. (Marcy sobbing) (ominous music) (Cat laughs) (lock buzzes) - Oh, Danny, I'm so glad to see you. - Hi, baby. I missed you too. - I love you. - That's what's making this so hard. Honey, I got bad news for you. - The appeal? - They denied it. We tried everything, we really did. I guess the only thing we can hope for now is the parole board. - I can't wait that long. Something is gonna happen to me if I stay in here. - What are you talking about? - You wouldn't believe it if I told you. - You're still keeping our little secret, aren't you? Aren't you? We just have to try to hold on. I love you. Hey, come on now. I said I love you. - Yeah, Danny, I love you too. - Anything I can get for you? - Get me out. - Warden Fletcher wants to see you. (pensive music) (lock buzzes) - I understand you had a little visit with Deputy Director Meyers. What did she want? - She asked me some questions. - About what? - About Margo. I was on laundry detail the day she died. - What did you tell her? - The truth. I was in the storeroom. I didn't see anything. - Does she suspect anything? - Is there something to suspect? (lock buzzes) - That'll be all, Demming. (sinister music) - What's the idea? - No idea, bitch. Just a lesson. Compliments of Cat. (Elizabeth moans) (ominous music) (Elizabeth screams) (Spider yelps) (tense music) (Elizabeth grunting) (ladies screaming) - Get her, Spider! Fucker! (Elizabeth shouts) (Spider yelping) (Spider screaming) (sinister music) - [Man] Sweets? (tapping at door) Hey, Sweets. Sweets? I got a message from Cat. She'll be waiting for you when you get out. (Stone laughs) (Elizabeth pounds wall) - Sweets! Sweets, it's Liz! Can you hear me? (pounding on wall) Sweets! - All right, Sweets! Time's up. It's back to the dorm. (Sweets gasping for breath) (chilling music) - Hey, what's going on out there? (pensive music) - Have a nice rest? Let's go. - Like some of my eggs? You look like you could use 'em. I only been in a couple of days. Still remember what real food tastes like. - Enjoy your vacation, Cherry? - Who the hell are you? - There's guards everywhere. You wanna go back in the hole, go ahead. - See you around, Cherry. - Stay outta my way, Icy. - Sure thing, Cherry. - Thanks. - I haven't heard that word too often since I've been here. My name is Katherine. - I'm Elizabeth. Why'd you step in like that? - I don't know, I guess I'm just the type that gets involved. Why are you here, if you don't mind my asking? - Cocaine across the border. You? - Manslaughter. - Your husband? - A trick. He paid me an extra hundred to tie him up and whip him. I didn't know the poor slob had a bad heart. Neither did he, I guess. - [Carol] Have a seat, Demming. - You know, you're really making it hard on yourself. - Other people make it hard for you. - Who are you talking about? Look, Demming, you're not a bad kid, I can see that, but your record's turning to shit. Why don't you help me and I'll help you? - How can I help you? - I'll level with you. I know something's going on in this prison. The only way I can learn more about it is from someone on the inside. - I will not be your stool pigeon. - [Carol] She's hopeless. - Maybe you're right. Shame. - You wanna help me? - Yes! - Get me a job where I can use my head. - What is it, Fletcher? - You have no authority to take my women off work detail. - [Carol] She's being interviewed. - You have the interview roster. Her name's on it. - I don't intend to discuss my policies in front of an inmate. Return her to work right away. - I'll return her when I'm finished. While you're here, I have an official request. - What? - [Shelly] Give this girl a better job assignment. - She's a troublemaker. - Well, maybe a good job'll keep her out of trouble. - It's out of the question. - Do it, Fletcher, or I call the director and ask him to ask you to do it. - I'll look into it. - Don't smile too soon. I got you that job. Now you owe me one. - Thanks for the job, but I will not be your informer. - I helped you out. I expect loyalty. - God, you guys are just like the rest. - And there's something going down between Meyers and that girl Demming. - Oh yeah? Like what? - I don't know. I think it's got something to do with Margo. You sure you were alone when it happened? - Yeah, I'm sure. Wanna shut her up? - Don't be stupid. She's too hot to handle. I want you to check up on her. See if your friends on the street can dig up anything about her. - Why don't we take her down a notch? - You trip her up. I'll take her down. Take your time. And do it right, or it's your ass instead of hers. - Hey, you're the boss. (saw buzzing) (suspenseful music) How's Cherry doing in the shop? - Forget about her, Cat. She's a waste of time. - Set her up. (hammers pounding) (suspenseful music) (Katherine laughs) (Elizabeth chatting indistinctly) (Katherine laughs) (Katherine gasps) - Jesus. - Who would do a thing like that? - Shakedown! On your feet, move it! (tool clanks) (brooding music) - It's a shame you can't be trusted, Demming. - I didn't put that there. - You know the rules. It's here, and that means you're guilty. You're out of the woodshop and back in the toilet. - But Meyers just gave- - Talking back? No commissary privileges, no phone calls, no visitors, for two months. - Back in bed, lights out. - I've been set up. - By who? - Guess. - You disappoint me, Demming. I went out of my way to help you and you screwed it up. - I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. - Feel sorry for yourself. You're the one that's behind bars. What's with you, Demming? I thought you had a brain. - You know, I was looking at myself in the mirror the other day. And I'm not me anymore. I feel like an animal. - Maybe you're not as smart as I thought you were. If you want to talk, you know where you can find me. - Hey! You're awful quiet today. - Yeah, I know. I've just been doing a lot of thinking. - What's on your mind? - I'm caught in the middle of something. - What do you mean? - I saw something I wasn't supposed to see. - What kind of something? - Cat killed somebody and I think the warden is trying to cover it up. - It doesn't pay to see things like that. - It could. I could talk about it and things could go easier on me. - Hey, Cherry. Wait a minute. - Leave me alone, Cat. - I got some news from the outside. It's about Danny Cole. - What about him? - You been a fool, that's what. What did he promise you? That he'd get you out? That he'd wait for you? - None of your business. - Well, I did some checking up on him. He's doing real fine. Got himself a real nice lady and they're living it up. - You're lying. - Yeah? Heard from him lately? Guys like that don't sleep alone waiting for a con. Wise up, Cherry. You been had! He's a fucking dealer. He set you up to sell his shit and played you for a sucker! Sucker! (pensive music) - Heard from Danny lately? (Icy screams) (tense music) Stop! (inmates shouting) (whistle tweets) (ominous music) (Stone laughs) (Elizabeth screams) (Stone laughing) (Elizabeth coughs) (guards laughing) - Find what you're looking for? - Yes, I think I have. There's even more here than I expected. - That's because I just collected it this morning. You are impatient. - Bullshit! You've been holding out on me. - Gimme a break, will you? I need cash to run this operation. - You don't run this operation, I do. And I'll tell you what you need and what you don't need. Maybe now you'll remember who's in charge. (Elizabeth groans) (sinister music) - I thought you might be getting a little lonely. I hope you enjoy this as much as me. - Where the hell is Elizabeth Demming? - She started a fight and assaulted a guard. You're wasting your time on that one. - Where the hell is she, goddammit? - Solitary! - I wanna see her. God. This girl had better be alive. Who gave orders to treat her like this? - Get her to the infirmary and then wash down this cell. Move it! - Save the act, Fletcher. You gave the orders! - You don't know that! - There are a lot of things I don't know around here, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out! - Is that a threat? - I'm just doing my job. - It's not your job to conduct a witch hunt! - In this case, I think it is. - Looks like Cherry's gonna be out of the infirmary in a couple of days. - Too bad you won't be able to see her. - What do you mean? - You are going to be transferred to another dorm. (sinister music) Cherry is mine. I don't want you to see her, or talk to her, or ever look at her again. You got it? - Elizabeth doesn't want anything to do with you. She knows all about you. - Knows what about me? Huh? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing! (muffled screaming) (Katherine gasps) - Knows what about me? - Nothing. Nothing! (muffled screaming) (water bubbling) - Talk to me, bitch! - About you and the warden. - What about me and the warden? Huh? What? - I don't know! - Let's send Cherry a get well card. You'd like to see Cherry, wouldn't you? (Elizabeth moans) - Hey, take it easy. I haven't lost a patient all day. - Where am I? - The infirmary. - Who are you? - Dr. Zeitlin. I come in a couple of times a week. - How long have I been here? - A couple of days. Warden Fletcher's been in here twice already asking about you. She'll be glad to hear you're feeling better. - Fletcher's been asking about me? - That's right. Asked me to personally supervise your recovery. (brooding music) (chilling music) (Cat laughs) - All right, ladies, bed check. (brooding music) Where's Roberts? Roberts? Roberts, you in here? Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on! Jesus Christ. - Katherine! - Back in bed, she's OD'd. Back in bed, Demming! - Please! - Come on, let's see about a goddamn ambulance. (somber music) - Oh, god. Please don't die. Oh, Katherine. God, don't die. Cat. (inmates cheering) (sinister music) (inmates cheering) (tense music) (inmates cheering) (tense music) You went too far, Cat. - It's you and me now, Cherry. Come on. Come on, Cherry. (inmates shouting) (whistle tweeting) (whistle tweeting) You want me, Cherry? Come and get me! (suspenseful music) (whistle tweeting) (inmates shouting) (Cat laughing) (inmates shouting) - [Elizabeth] I'm gonna get you, Cat! - I hear ya, Cherry! I hear ya! (Elizabeth grunts) Here, want it, Cherry? Here, take it. (shiv clangs) (Elizabeth grunts) (Elizabeth grunting) (Cat laughs) Come here. - You shouldn't have killed Katherine, Cat. - Katherine was coming between us. (Elizabeth grunts) - [Elizabeth] I'm gonna kill you! (Cat laughs) (Elizabeth shouts) (electricity popping) (Cat groaning) - All right. So you're tough. I didn't think you had it in you. - [Elizabeth] I'm not proud of it. - Mmm, you oughta be. I never thought I'd see Cat take the fall. - Cat worked for you, didn't she? - Cat was getting sloppy. She wasn't keeping her mind on business. You took care of yourself pretty good. If you're smart, you'll keep taking care of yourself. - How? - Work for me. - I'm not gonna become another Cat. - You're gonna be here a long time. Do you want to get along and have a good life? Do it my way. - What if I say no? - You don't have any choice. - Hey! Wait a minute. I want to speak with your prisoner. - She's on her way back to block. - I'll take full responsibility. Is there a problem? - No, ma'am. - I've been trying to see you. - Everything's changed. I've got the information you've been looking for. - Let's go to my office where we can talk. - Wait! I wanna know what happens to me. - What do you mean? - I want outta here! - Oh, I can't do that. Your record's too bad, Demming. - I want out or it's no deal! - I can't make that deal, Demming. Just give me the information and trust me. - I got a job to do, lady. - In a minute. Cut the bullshit, Demming! - I've gotta live in this hole. You want me to stick out my neck and wait around for justice? I'd be dead by morning. - All right. It's a deal. I'll do it. One more favor. - Name it. - Danny Cole. (mellow lounge music) (guests chatting) - Can I buy you a drink? - Thanks, but, um, I have plenty of money. - How much did you bring? - I believe you said 50,000? - Smart girl. I like girls who know how to follow orders. - I'll bet you do. - Why don't we go to my car? It's always a pleasure doing business. - Let's get on with it, huh? - Patience, patience. It's a virtue. Now, this is the best there is. You could even step on it once or twice and nobody'd know the difference. - That's nice, but why don't you just hold right there? (pensive music) - I'll take that from you. (cuffs click) - Danny. Elizabeth sends her love. - You finally got to her, didn't you? - It's over, Fletcher. We have all we need. - Get rid of me and someone else will take my place. It's the system. - Times have changed, Fletcher. I tried to tell you that. - This is a prison, not a finishing school. The only thing these women understand is power. It's the only way to break them. - You've broken your last girl. - You think you're better than I am? Spend some time in here with me and the animals. We'd love to have you. And then tell me you're any better. - Afraid you'll have to come with us. (brooding music) (pensive music) - I think I'm gonna walk.
