- Hello, Griffin, it's been a while. Won't you have a seat. - Thank you. - Hiding from someone? - Oh, this? Um, yes, I guess you could say that in a manner of speaking. - Well, you know you don't have to hide from me, don't you? I'm here to help. You can at least take off the sunglasses. - I'd rather keep them on. If that's okay with you. - Of course, whatever makes you comfortable. You skipped our last two sessions, Griffin. What brings you back? - Well, Doctor, I needed to talk to someone. I needed to talk to you. - I see. I recall from your last visit that you were having some trouble adjusting to college. A lot of pressure academically, trouble getting along with some of your classmates. Is that still the case? - No, Dr. Kemp, not exactly. - Trouble at home? - I'm here, Dr. Kemp, because I want to tell you a story. - I'll listen to anything you have to say. You know that. - I'm gonna warn you though, I, I don't think you're going to believe what I have to tell you. - Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I can at least promise to keep an open mind. - Good. You're going to need one. You see, it all started a few days ago. Port Burdock University closed for the summer. There were still a few faculty and students left on campus, you know, mostly kids who wanted to catch up on their grades or undergrads like me who needed equipment to finish their thesis. There were still a few jocks around, of course, training for football season or whatever. They still seemed to have it out for me, especially Jordan and his friends. Jordan and his two friends, Bobby and Stewart, as you may know, have been tormenting me since high school. Needless to say, they got into Port Burdock on an athletic scholarship. - Hey Griffin, catch! Gotta work on those reflexes, pal. - Everything came so easy to them, and it came so hard to me. You see, during my senior year of high school, things reached a sort of breaking point between they and I. I was taking a mandatory phys ed class, and everyone had already changed up and gone to the next class. Everyone except Jordan, Bobby, and Stewart. - Hey guys, look who it is. - Looks like somebody's taking a shower with the guys. Maybe we should show him that present we got him. - Grab him. Not here, in there. See Griffin, every time you spill your guts to the principal about us or you tell your shrink we're pickin' on you, we don't get to play ball. - One more time, and we get canned from the team. - So, we are taking this opportunity to convince you to keep your mouth shut for good. - No, please don't, please. - Don't scream. - I guess you could say it worked. You see, I've never told anybody what happened in that locker room, until now. The school had given me carte blanche use of the science lab. Whether they smelled money or prestige if my experiment went well, I don't know. I hadn't thought that far ahead. All I knew was that I had work to do and work to finish. Tom, my best friend, had agreed to help me in the lab. - I think it's ready. Earth to Griffin. - Huh, what? Oh, sorry. Thank you. - Rolling. - What kind of experiment were you working on? - Oh, I'm sorry, I guess that's the most important part of my story. Uh, my thesis was changing the refractive index of a solid to that of air. It's something I've been toying with since I was a kid, I guess. - I'm afraid I don't follow. - I believe you'd call it invisibility, Doctor. - I see. Please continue. - See, I had started experimenting with an invisibility serum when I was in high school. Have you ever wished you could be invisible, Doctor? Because I did. Every time my parents fought or I got picked on in gym class, I would think about how I'd kill just to disappear. And by the time I went to college, metaphysics and stealth technology had advanced to a point where it was no longer a silly dream out of a sci-fi movie. It was, it was actually a reality. But I was missing something. - Maybe it needs some more time. - No, it should be instantaneous. My notes, the computer model, everything tells me that it should happen the moment the serum interacts with the object, and I just, I just don't get it. - Okay, maybe you need some more time. - Something's missing. - Griffin. - No, Tom, I got the entire formula right, but there's just something missing, an element, uh, a catalyst. - Have you even eaten today? - I'm fine. - What about Elyse? - Trust me, if anybody gets this, it's Elyse. Besides, she's working on her own thesis, and if I know her like I think I do, she's probably holed up in her room right now with a stack of books to the ceiling. - Looks like Elyse isn't the only option around, huh? - Oh, very funny, ha ha. - Isn't that one of the guys from your old high school? - I was just looking. - Okay, okay. Ease up. I'm gonna go grab a bit in town. You wanna come with me? - Uh, no, I'm gonna stay here, keep working. - Suit yourself. But if you ask me, you need a break. - Tom was right. The pressures of trying to crack this experiment were, were getting to me, but this was not some simple experiment. I mean, this was a major scientific breakthrough. I mean, why couldn't he understand that? I couldn't figure it out. There was something missing from the equation, but it was just beyond my grasp. And then it hit me. The serum needed to be energized. It required a spark to change it from inert to active. But it was supposed to be instantaneous. I mean, why wasn't it working? Had the addition of electricity slowed down the process or? Oh my. The orange was completely invisible, but still there. I had finally done it. I had made a solid object invisible. Of course, my notes show that the effects would only last, you know, for an hour or so, it was temporary, but, but it as still just a piece of fruit. I mean, impressive enough to make invisible, I supposed, but I wanted more. I wanted to see my serum work on something, something alive. I guess you could say this was the whole point of my experiment. I wanted to know what it felt like to be invisible. I knew that the formula wasn't poisonous, and I didn't have a test animal to experiment on, but more than that, however, I knew that I would be the first living creature to try this out. I have no idea how much time had passed. When I woke up, the first thing I wanted to do was look at myself. Somehow, I had finally done it. I was completely invisible. Of course, it was one thing for me to believe I was invisible, but I had to believe I truly was invisible. I needed to see how someone else would react, someone like Proctor. Proctor had fascinated me for a long, long time. We went to the same high school, but we had never spoken. Maybe I lacked the nerve, but now, now I could follow him all night and he'd never know. I had never considered myself a voyeur before, but suddenly, I had a passport into the private life of someone else, and it was over way too soon. I knew I had to get back to the lab before the serum's effects wore off. But the serum had passed its first test. Proctor couldn't see me. - Hi, this is Tom, leave a message. And if this is Griffin, get some sleep and tell me about it later. - Tom, it's me. I did it, the serum works. And look, I know you're gonna freak out about this, but um, I tested it on myself too, and I'm invisible. So, uh, hurry up and get down here to the lab as soon as you can, and I'll show you. Okay, bye. I had to tell someone about it. If I couldn't tell Tom, then I decided I would surprise Elyse. I knew the invisibility serum would wear off soon, so I had to hurry. Like me, Elyse was spending her summer at the college working on a thesis. It also gave us time to be together, when we weren't busy working. I knew I'd been preoccupied with completing my experiment over the last few weeks, but what I hadn't expected was, was me being replaced. Roger Donovan, he was a friend of Elyse's, always around when I showed up to take her to dinner or to take her to a movie. Now, I knew why. Watching them, I felt fury and betrayal. I wanted to yell at them. I wanted to punch Roger in his smug, all-superior little face, and yet, like when I watched Proctor in his room, I found myself fascinated. Neither one of them knew I was there. I could, I could watch them all night. Or I could join in. Roger thinking I was Elyse, Elyse thinking I was Roger. They were so into each other, they had no idea. - Well, that was abrupt. - I'm sorry, I just, I gotta put in some time at the weight room today. It's coach's orders. - Is that all? - Well-- - It's Griffin, right? You're afraid he's gonna find you here? Don't worry, okay? He's so tied up with his experiments, I probably won't see him around for weeks. - Look, I like you, okay? I really do, I just, I do not want to get in the middle of something between you two. - You're actually afraid of him? - Let's get one thing straight, nobody is afraid of Griffin. And I'm just saying, maybe you should break up with him, make things easier on everybody. - Give me a reason. - I just did. - I had no idea what I would do from this point on. I knew the serum was wearing off and that I'd lose my advantage, but while I still had it, I figured I'd follow Roger and my anger. As I watched him, I let my anger build, let it grow. I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I guess I had no idea what he had taken from me. I'm not even sure I had Elyse to begin with. And maybe it was the statement he made back in her room. "Nobody is afraid of Griffin." I wanted him to be very afraid. I had all this power, I was invisible. I could reach out and touch him if I wanted to, and he'd just think it was the water from his shower. - Nobody is a afraid of Griffin. Nobody is afraid of Griffin. - But the more I thought about it, I knew he had to pay. It was fate, fate that I had found him with Elyse, fate that I had heard what he really thought of me, fate that I was alone with him right now. - Nobody is afraid of Griffin. - I don't think I'd planned on killing him. And once he was dead, I had no idea what I would do next. I was no murderer, I mean, I did my best to make it look like an accident. I mean, after all, lots of people fall and get hurt in the shower, don't they? - We need to talk. - What's wrong? - Is Griffin here? - I haven't seen him all day, why? - Has he called you, anything like that? - No, are you gonna tell me what's wrong? - It's his invisibility thing. I agreed to help him with his experiment, you know? I never thought anything would come of it. I thought he'd collect some data and give up and move on to something more practical. - And he wouldn't, he's obsessed. - Yeah, well, it gets worse. This message he left me, he says that he actually did it. He says that he made something invisible. - You think he actually did it? - Of course not. - Okay, he's been under a lot of pressure. - Yeah, that's not all. He also said he used the serum on himself. He said he was invisible. I'm really worried about him. He might be sick, and if he's not sick, he's at least lost his mind. That's why I came here. I figured you could help me talk to him. - I was thinking about breaking up with him, Tom. - Well, first thing's first, could you come with me to the science lab. Maybe if he knows his friends care about him, he'll listen to reason and get some help. - Sure. - Once my rage had subsided, I realized exactly what I had done. Call it a moment of weakness, if you will. It suddenly felt as if I'd gone too far. This is why we weren't supposed to be invisible. There were places we weren't meant to go, things we weren't meant to see. Maybe after the invisibility wore off, I could blame it all as a side effect of the serum, but I was about to face another reality. I had injected myself only a few minutes after I injected the fruit. I should have returned to normal by now, and all my calculations show that the effects would only be temporary, and for the fruit, they were. What I hadn't taken into account was the way the serum would interact with living cells. The fact that cells continuously generate electricity, as long as my cells were alive, I would remain invisible. It was easy, I'd find an antidote. I'd come this far, I mean, there had to be a way to reverse the process. It was the only thing that was keeping me from going over the edge. - He's not here. - Well, his clothes are. - And so is his cell phone. This is worse than I thought. - What's this? - It's the test subject, the one he supposedly turned invisible. - Well, do you think somebody attacked him? - I think he needs help. If we don't find him, he's gonna be in some serious trouble. - Where do you think he is? - I don't know. He's not in his dorm room. I went there before I came you. And if he's not here, and he's not in the dorm, he probably went into town to go find me. - Naked? - At this point, it wouldn't surprise me. - Well, what are you doing? - I can't just let his research lay around. I'm gonna hold onto this until we find him. - My research, I needed to find a cure, yet I, I remained silent. Seeing Tom and Elyse standing together like, like that, hearing what they really thought of me, I could feel the rage growing inside of me again. Everyone had betrayed me. I had crossed unimaginable scientific boundaries, and yet, to them, I was still nothing but a sick, crazy, little joke. - We'll just drive into town and check out a few places to see if he's around. If we don't find him there, I say we come back here and wait for him. - Maybe we should call the police. - I'd rather find him before the police do. - I could've gotten right into the car with them, and they would never have known I was there. But they'd be back, and I'd be right here waiting for them. Besides, I had other targets to take my newfound aggression out on. Two down, two to go. I didn't worry about fixing the crime scene this time. Poor Stewart just had a nasty little accident. And even if the police were looking for him, they'd never find me, right? - Damn car. I don't need this. I have a date. What? - Time to die, Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. - Jesus, what the heck is that? - Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. - Jesus. What's going on? Hello? Help, help. Help! Hello! - I hate to admit it, but it was getting easier to kill every time. I was actually starting to enjoy myself. And then there was only Jordan. Big man on campus. I stood there and watched him, admired him, hated him. Jordan. Jordan. - Bobby. Stewart, are you guys out here? - Bobby and Stewart are dead. - Griffin? Why don't you crawl out from under your rock so I can see you? - See, that's the thing, Jordan, you can't see me. I think it kind of evens out the playing field, don't you think? - Yeah, real cute. Think you had it bad before, wait till I get ahold of ya. This ain't funny, man. Come out where I can see you. - We're gonna work on my reflexes now, Jordan. You know, for a second, I almost thought I'd be free after killing Jordan, but I still knew I had business to attend to. - Okay. I want you to wait down here in the car until I get back. If Griffin shows up, try talking to him. He'll listen to you. - Well, what about you? - I'm gonna go inside the lab and look around. Maybe he's hidin' out somewhere in there. I'll be back here in a few minutes, so we can both look for him. - Hurry back, Tom. - You know, I don't think he's gonna find me in there. - Griffin? - Don't turn around. - You don't want me to see you. - You can't see me. - You really are in invisible. - I was always invisible to you. What was I to you, Elyse? Someone to just pass the time with until a Roger or a Tom came along? Some pathetic little introvert you could take pity on? God, you are just like everyone else. - Griffin, please-- - No. 'Cause, baby, everyone else is dead. Why did you do it? Why didn't you tell me it was over? Why did you sleep with Roger behind my back? Looking down into her eyes, I felt all my anger slipping away for a moment. Did she deserve to die? Did any of them really deserve to die? It was one of the last sane moments I'd ever have. - I'm sorry, Griffin. - Oh my god. Griffin? Are you in here? I saw the tape. I'm sorry I didn't believe you about the serum. - So little faith, Tom. I'm hurt. You see, here I thought we were pals, I did. I thought you really believed in my research. Turns out, you just want a crack at my girlfriend. - Elyse is worried about you. So am I. - Oh, I killed people tonight, Tom. How worried are you now? - You've killed people? Who have you killed, Griffin? - You know the old saying, don't you, Tom? Out of sight, out of mind. Well, it turns out, I don't have a guilty conscience anymore. You see, I've committed many, many, many sins tonight. You know what? I really don't think one more's gonna make a difference. You can't hide from me, Tom. I could be anywhere. - Please, Griffin, don't do this. Whatever it is, I can help you. We can fix this, whatever it is, we can fix it. - Who says I wanna be fixed? Thomas. - If you're gonna kill me, kill me. Do it. - I'm going to let you and Elyse leave. Pack up and go. Don't come back, and don't ever come looking for me again. You understand me? - What about those people you killed? What happens when the police start asking questions? - Oh, they'll never, ever find me. After that, I decided to lay low for a while, but like they say, no man is an island, not even an invisible man, which is why I decided to talk to you. I wanted to get this all off my chest. - I'm glad you did, Griffin. - So, in your professional opinion, what do we do now, Doctor? - Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to admit you to the hospital. It would just be overnight and it would strictly be for observation. If everything checks out, maybe the best thing for you would be to get away for a while. There's some fine facilities around here. It'd be more like a vacation than medical treatment. - You think I'm going crazy, don't you? - I think you're a brilliant young man who's been under a lot of pressure. No one's saying you're crazy. But I do think you need help. You're so desperate to be left alone that you've convinced yourself that you're invisible, that you've used this invisibility to murder your friends. - Oh no, Doctor, I think you're gravely mistaken. See, this is no more than makeup, a sweater, and some gloves. I don't need convincing. You do. So, let this be a warning to you all. The next time you hear footsteps on your porch or hear something unseen laughing at you from the shadows, it could just be your imagination, or it could be me. Lock your doors and windows, I'll be watching you.
