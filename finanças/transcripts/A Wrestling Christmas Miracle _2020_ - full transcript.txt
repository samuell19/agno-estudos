- If there is a name synonymous with youth wrestling in the state of New Jersey it's Kace Gabriel, the son of Olympian Ajax Gabriel. Kace has been on a torrid track to outdo his champion father. This home video footage shows it all. Refusing to begin wrestling until age 10, the young Gabriel has won 50 consecutive matches in the last year and a half, and he has accomplished this undefeated record without a single practice before his first match. Some in the rest willing elite have been mystified. Others, including his father say there's no mystery. - It's genetics. The kid is a machine built to win! - And win he does. In his whirlwind entrance to the world of competitive grappling, Kace Gabriel has won two state championships, walked red carpets at national wrestling award ceremonies, and even appeared in a protein shake commercial with his father. Also a standout football player, Kace has terrorized opposing quarterbacks, breaking the league sack record and crushing anyone in the opponent's backfield. With lightening quick speed and raw, mean muscle, Kace Gabriel is a tackling machine in the mode of the Steel Curtain's best. - Now let me tell you who my favorite NFL player of all time is, it's mean Joe Greene. First, he's mean. I'm mean, and you have to be mean to be in the NFL. Second, he's strong. I'm strong. Third, he's fast. I'm fast. I also hear he's a really nice guy, and I'm a really nice guy and that's cool. But most importantly, he's the best tackler of all time. And I'm the best tackler for my age. Watch me tackle this fool. Now that's a perfect tackle. I hit him low, I hit him hard. Now you're gonna see a lot more of that. - Yes, Kace Gabriel has done a lot of tackling on the football field. He would surely make mean Joe Greene proud. But it's wrestling first for this young man. That fast and mean hard hitting is even more powerful on the mat. What impresses his wrestling enthusiasts the most is that Kace's winning formula seems to be rooted in the mastering of certain key moves. The arm drag, the front headlock, a legal body slam, a head smash, and a half nelson. It's not these core moves alone that I've made Kace Gabriel into a champion, it's hard work. Once Kace blasted onto the wrestling scene a day has not gone by when the now 11 year old hasn't worked out. Some say it's Kace Gabriel's brute physical strength that makes him unbeatable. Ask his father. - The best wrestler's a strong wrestler! That's my son Kace! - Yeah, oh my god. - So it's genetics, key mastered moves, working out, and physical strength that has led Kace Gabriel to 50 consecutive wins, and one would think many more to come. But now this has all come to an end. - I'm done with wrestling, at least for now. - Done with wrestling, why is that Kace? Because in 40 days and 40 nights, it's Christmas. - So? - My friend has been in a coma for three months, and if I make a movie that will make him laugh he'll come out of his coma. - You're going to make a movie at only 11 years old in hopes that your friend will come out of his coma? - Yes, and I'm gonna write it and direct it and you have to help me. - I'm sure it's not the abusive language towards your patients that landed you in here. - I don't know what's wrong with this clown. - Agent Truman, you had something to say? - You are a complete mental midget. You do not have Dr. Reno in front of you. - I don't? - No you don't. Does the fact that you are blind also make you stupid. - You are not Dr. Salvador Reno? The man who has surgically removed that boys tongue in an experimental procedure to cure his autism? - One doesn't cure autism. It's not a disease Warden Jeffries. - Oh, it appears I've made two mistakes. - The governor made the mistake in appointing a blind moron the warden of this unnecessary facility. - I don't find your mocking of the warden's disability appropriate Agent Truman. It's rather indignant for young woman in law enforcement. - I am not Agent Truman. I am Agent Sheridan. I simply translate Agent Truman's thoughts. He is a genius with a 180 IQ. I'm just his mouthpiece, and I am a nobody. - And I'm a psychiatrist, and I can help you with that narcissism Agent Truman. - You can't help anything because you are now a prisoner. - Stop it, both of you. Agent Truman, whether you like it or not, you still work for me. And for you, Dr. Caroline Stone, you are an inmate in my hospital. Shall we now look at some of your indiscretions? - Idiot. - There you are. Where have you been? - Oh, I've been meeting the doctor, I mean, people, people. - Oh, so you've probably met my boss, Agent Truman? - Yes, I've had that pleasure. He's the chief of security, right? - Ah yes, we're quite lucky to have that hero here. - Hero? - Oh yes, come. Agent Truman was the FBI's top field agent. He took down Jane Gang Green, broke his neck with his bare hands. Every mass murderer he was the head of investigation on, but then he was tortured by that crazy judge who turned out to be a serial killer. - Mm, that's how he lost his voice. - No, his mother was a. - And his legs? - A boating accident, he was drunk at the time. Anyway, welcome to St. Claire's Correctional Institute. Day one of your sentence is officially over. - What do you think? - What were all the beeps for? - You guys stupidly used curse words. - Isn't there foul language in movies? - Not movies for 11 year old kids. - Like Charlie, my best friend, the kid we made the movie for. - I didn't script it with curse words. - You didn't script it with curse words? - You know what I mean, when I oversaw the scripting of it. - You oversaw the scripting of it? - Okay, when you oversaw the scripting of it. - Thank you. - Mom, Dad, let's get real here. - Neither of you had anything to do with the script. - Yes, I was the inspiration for this project. I think he's trying to say, "Get lost Ronald, I was clearly the inspiration for it." - You were all inspirations, okay. You all helped in the most valuable ways of making this movie. - Uh, yeah, like paying for it, and starring in it too. Yeah, why can't we just congratulate this young man? I mean, he wrote and directed a movie, he's not even a teenager. You did a great job, kiddo. - Thank you Uncle Ronald. But guys, this isn't about me. It's about Charlie. In five days it's Christmas, and when he hears this movie he's going to wake up from his coma, laughing. - Kace, you did a wonderful thing here. - But you do know that there's a chance that Charlie may not wake up. - You need to start wrestling again, pal. - I'll start wrestling again after Christmas when Charlie wakes up. - Oh yeah? Come here! You know what Abraham Lincoln said don't you? Only a fool has himself for an attorney, and the bearded man with no mustache was right. Well, what is it that the Gabriels say? - A wrestler only has him on the mat! The fool is the guy he's pinning! - Absolutely. - That's right. Now Kace, you need to be strong. You need to be strong for Charlie and for yourself, okay? Hey, it was great sticking around for this movie, but I'm gonna do what I do every year at Christmas time either with you or without you, usually it's with you. - We are not going to the Congo with you to wrestle. - So be it. Kace I am going to wrestle an elephant for you. Check it out! And you young lady, listen, I have hidden in Ronald's car a whole bunch of presents for Kace. Now let's all huddle it up, Gabriel-style. Ready? - One, two three, Merry Christmas! Go, go, go! Pin that elephant! - Hey, you, Ronald, take care of my babies. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Uh Kace, give Uncle Ronald the hard drive with the movie on it and the copies. - Copies? - The DVD copies of it. - DVDs? - Backups. - Listen, your dad made me the associate producer for a reason. Give me the hard drive, I'll make a copy of it, I'll make a copy of the DVDs, and I keep it safe for you, buddy. - Okay Uncle Ronald. That's my boy, oh thank you. You got it, buddy, there we go. - All right, Ronald, guard this with your life. It's not good that we only have one copy. I will sis, this is like gold in my hands. - Thank you Ronald. Let's hope for the best with this one. - It is going to be the best Christmas ever, I tell ya. - Wow, my whites do look whiter. Wow, my whites do look whiter. Wow, my whites do look whiter. Wow, my whites do look whiter. Wow, my whites do look whiter. Wow, my white do look whiter. - Oh my god Wow, my whites do look whiter. - My girlfriend doesn't know her one and only line. - Huh? - Wow, my whites look cleaner and whiter than ever. - Wow, my whites do look whiter and brighter and cleaner. - Than ever. - Than ever before. - Perfect. - Hey, did you get it? - Kitty Kat, I did not go to the interview. - What, why not? - Tired of doing the dangerous work. - Chuckles, you're up to your frickin' eyeballs in debt, and this house is in foreclosure. - Yeah, well, I decided to become a starving actor like you. - Hey, that's great. Wouldn't it be a kick if that kid's movie is a hit, and we get all famous and everything because because we get discovered from that kid's movie? - Big kick. Kid wakes up on Christmas, you and I become incredibly rich and famous, and we were barely in that movie. The great Ajax Gabriel saw to that. - Well, I think I nailed my scenes. - Oo Kitty, we gotta go. We got a job. - What, what we got? - Revenge! - You're gonna do one of your incredible accents? - Oh kitty, I believe I am. - You are a genius, Chucky. - Hey, do I need to go change clothes? - You want one? - No thank you Mrs. Morrison. - You know Kace, Charlie really appreciates you coming to spend time with him. I know we can't say it, but thank you. - Cool, Mrs. Morrison. How come these home now? - Well, there wasn't really much more they could do at the hospital. I just want him home with me. You know you're his best friend, right? - He's my best friend. - Keep talking to him, he hears you. I know he does. - Okay. Hey Charlie, how's it goin'? So you know, how we always talked about making a movie, the funniest movie ever? Well, I did it. I made a movie, and everybody helped because because they believe in me, they believe in you, Charlie. I made this movie for you, and it's so silly and funny that when you hear it you're going to wake up from your coma. When you hear this movie, you will wake up, and you will be laughing. I know my movie will bring you out of this coma. It's going to be the best Christmas ever. - The buffoon has gone to bed, let's go. - Wait, what are we doin' and what's-his-face, what's this guy's house? - Ronald, Ajax Gabriel's associate producer, and idiot brother-in-law and wrestling dope. - Wrestling dummy. - What? - That's what it's called, a wrestlin' dummy. - Kitty Kat, sometimes I think it's quite possible there may be traces of a brain in there. - That is so because sweet, thank you so much. - Now, we are here because the dummy left the Christmas gifts in the car. - How do you know? - I have my minions on it, and your immensely cunning and gorgeous boyfriend has a scathingly brilliant plan to make off with a Gabriel's Christmas. - Make off? - And then some. - You mean steal. I'm a mean one, Kitty Kat. - Bye, you big dummy. - What? - They're all gone. - Ronald, how could you leave the door unlocked? All of Kace's presents are in there. He's gonna be so disappointed. - The movie. - Wait, what? - The presents, the movie, it's all gone. - Yeah, but you made copies. - Can I get a brew? - Ronald Duncan McNulty, tell me that you made copies of this movie. - Yeah, I made copies, but I didn't make any copies. - You better pray that Ajax is not on top of an elephant. - What's going on, Mom? - Kace, go get ready for dinner. It's 2:00 in the afternoon. - Then go get ready for a snack. Your uncle and I are busy. - Well, you could just say, "Please give you uncle and I some privacy." - He's so polite, such a good boy. - Kace, now. - You know, you raised him so well, sis. You know, his uncle, I love him, you know? - All circuits are busy. Please try your call again later. - Damn it. You better start texting, and I'm gonna keep dialing and we both better start praying. - All circuits are busy. - Wow. - Wow! - Wow. - Cool! Oo, oo, Kitty, look. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Kitty, Kitty. - I wanna be cowboy. - Gnomies! - Really, gnomies? - Gnomies! Hey, look, video games. - Hey, this drive should work in our supposedly smart TV. - Don't we need, like, controls or somethin', a joystick? - Really? - Record this sentence. We were friends once. You were once pillars of the community. Hence, the reason why I've decided to render the judgment here, at this hospital that you destroyed, instead of my courtroom, where you made a mockery. - Oh jolly good jelly, it's Kace's movie! - It's our movie. Ah-oo-gah! - We did do a good job in defending ourselves. - No, no, you didn't, Dr. Lemon. Did you notice how the prosecuting attorney used you closing argument verbatim as his closing argument? - That is not true in your honor. I wrote my submission first and he's stole it from me. - What you talkin' 'bout Willis? It takes different strokes for different blokes. - You are amazing Chuckles. - I did take some liberties. - You arrogant, condescending think that you're lawyers. You're not! You're doctors! Really bad doctors who should have had really good lawyers! - You're not gonna find us guilty, are you? - Oh you right I'm gonna find you guilty. - Judge, you can't! I saved your son's life. - You're a doctor. That's what you're supposed to do, doctor. - Wait, wait, hold on Sherman. You worked on the judge's son? - Yes, first I shot his son, then I saved his life, yadda, yadda, yadda. - Judge, I demand that you tell us what happened with the shootin'. - Dynomite, you goof ball. Ain't no good times for him, though no more huh? Now, watch this masterpiece unfold with a crescendo by none other than moi. - You speak French? - Si. - To Dr. Rinard's credit, it was an accident. - And pretty funny story. I gotta tell ya- - You shooting my son is not relevant to this case, nor is the fact that you saved his life. I'll tell you what is relevant, what you did to this hospital! - Well, oops, there it is, we got a mistrial. - Yeah, and, you know, this trial didn't go correctly 'cause I didn't do it. - I didn't do it either. - I definitely did it, but I loved it and I would do it again! - You son of a. - This is the guilty guy, right here! - And you have been pitchin' him on a drug-induced coma for months now. - And I keep telling you, I'm completely fine with that. - No mistrial, no comas. That would be too easy for you pack of jack. You are so lucky I don't have the right to you. - Your honor, now I've been researchin' that, and I think I've found a loophole that you may be happy to hear. - Judge, you have to legally declare a mistrial here. I shot your son even if it was by accident. - Oh wait, wait, judge, judge, your honor, your honor. I would actually like to hear about that shooting. It actually sounds kind of funny. - Actually it is a little funny. You see, the judge's son, he's a little strange. - I didn't wanna say anything. - What? - And I will see to it that more corrupt doctors join you here as prisoners. Together you all are going to restore this beautiful hospital to the once divine institution that it was. - Yeah, I'm sorry guys, I'm gonna have to with. - Bingo, we have a winner, Kitty, but what were all the stupid beeps for? - Why couldn't we call from home, Chuck? I just want to play. - So they can't trace the phone call Mrs. Einstein. - Who's Mrs. Einstein? Chuck are you cheatin' on me? - We were misused in that movie. - Yeah, but we got a lot of free food. - Our blinding talent wasn't used properly. - And unlimited coffee. - Do you want more coffee Ms. Kitty Kat? - Coffee? No, no. And only I call her Ms. Kitty Kat. Ms. Kitty Kat. - Yeah? - I'll get you all the coffee in Mexico you want. - Yeah? - Heck, I'll own Mexico. - Hey, that's great! - Mrs. Gabriel I presume. Mrs. Gabriel, is this you? Mrs. Gabriel this is Chancellor Clout. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ronald, we need to tell Kace! - Oy. - Tell me what Mom? - Kace, honey, sweetheart, darling. - Mom. - Your uncle has something that he would like to tell you. - Aw, buddy, pal, man, I- - Is something the matter with dad? - No, no, no, no, your father is fine. The movie is missing. - What are you talking about? It's in Uncle Ronald's car. - Yes, it was in Uncle Ronald's car, but he left the door unlocked and all the presents were taken including the hard drive with the movie on it. - It's gone, buddy. I didn't even get a chance to make copies of the damn thing. I am so sorry. - I've been trying to get in touch with Daddy. - He can't come home now, he's in the Congo. - This is an emergency. - I have to see Charlie. - No, Kace, just wait! - I'll be back, Mom. - Uncle Ronald, please get the movie back for Charlie. - Hello? Yes, this is she. It's some Russian guy. Wait, no it's Irish? It's Irish. It's Southern guy? Wait, oh okay, it's a German guy, and he's saying that he has the film. - What? - He's saying he only wants to talk to me, mein frau. He says that if we call the police we'll never see the film again. Okay, listen, we won't call the police, but just tell me why are you doing this? How can you be so cruel? Um, listen, your accent is just very, are you sure that you're German? Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What the hell is going on? - A million dollars, a million dollars to give us back that hard drive. - A million dollars, Germans? I say we give 'em the money. A million dollars? - Ah, it's for Kace - We don't need to call the police, we need to call Ajax - Now listen, you keep calling Ajax. I will get the movie back, you can trust me. - I just talked to my Uncle Ronald, and he said he was getting the movie back form the Germans or French, whatever they are. They said we're not allowed to call the cops, but either way we're getting this movie back. I promise Charlie, I promise. The Gabriel's always pin their man. - Oh, you must be Dr. Stone, hello. - Hello, it's like everyone knows my name already. - Well you're our first newbie, and we're all goin' insane in here with boredom. - Well, I'm a psychiatrist, I can actually help you with that. - Oh, I always thought psychiatry was just a scam, and that you ain't real doctors. I think they cut half of my scenes out, but I am awful good. - Yeah, well, you're gonna get the last word, Kitty Kat. - I, I look good, don't I? I do look good, don't I Chucky? - Delicious. Yes. Good, we can be there in 30 minutes. Gracias mi amigo. Babe, pussy cat, love of my ingenious, delectable, wonderful life! - Somethin' good? - You have no idea. We got ourselves a theater. - Theater for what? - To watch it on the big screen with Mark Keen. - Mark Keen, the Mark Keen? Of Keen Entertainment, Mark Keen? - None other. He agreed to watch the movie, but he wants to see it in his theater. - Oh Chucky, Chuck, Chuckles, I love it when you do everything right. You take care of everything. - It's our movie now. We either make a deal with Mark Keen or we get a million dollars from those wrestling neanderthals, but either way we win! Either way, we move up to Mexico! - Yes! - Which is where again? - Anywhere you want it to be. - Oh, hold on, hold on, senorita, vamanos. - All right Kace, you can have two things, two. - Okay. - Hey guys, can I get you anything? - Yes, please. Can I pick out what I want? - Choose as you wish. - Thank you very much. Can I have this? - Why would the Germans want this movie? - And how did they know it was in your car? - I don't think he knew it was in the car. It was just in the back with the presents. - Can I have one of these? - Did you get ahold of Ajax? - You would know if I got a hold of Ajax because you wouldn't have a head right now. It's the Germans. - Hello? - Pip, pip and all that, it's your favorite thieves. - Um, who is this? This doesn't sound like the Germans. - Oh no, dare I say not. Either way Mary Poppins, don't mistake that we do indeed have the movie and we intend on getting our million, which is roughly 799,000 in pounds. - Oh, you're so talented blokey. - Crikey, would you kindly, shut up. - Hold on. - Hello? - That's Chuck Wiener, he played Dr. McShea in the movie. - No, mate! - How do you know? - Because he always wanted to do an accent, but they were so terrible Dad wouldn't let him. It got Chuck really mad. - You don't put somebody as powerful as Prince Charles on hold. I'm back Prince Charles. I moved up to King and I want to set off the drop off, the where and when of it all. - Yes, yes, of course, the where and when pf it all, I'm listening. - We have their address, we know it, right? - I've got their address. - There's a very special dumpster that I want you to deposit the million in. I suppose you want to know where this dumpster is. - Mom, take it off mute. - Hello? - Uh yes. - Are you listening to me? Take this information down my love, and we expect you to adhere to it to a T. - Tell her we want it in dollars, not, uh, what's it called? - Pounds. - Pounds. - Chuck, Kitty, these guys! - Hello Mark. - Hi Mark. - Hi, thank you. - Hi, boy, do we got a Christmas present for you. - Well, I celebrate Valentine's Day at Christmas, but you've sparked my interest. Good, good. - Uh, one second, one sec. - Keen entertainment, how may I direct your call. I'm sorry Mr. Keen is in a meeting. May I give him a message? I see, well, let me connect you with one of his partners. Please hold. - What if they're not home? - Then we wait. - Wait, they specifically said to take the money and put it in a dumpster. Isn't that what they said? Take the money, put it in a dumpster in that office building in Hackensack. - So what, who cares what they said? We can ambush him here. - Maybe it's not a good idea sis. If you'd let me handle this... - Ronald, we are going to do this. We are getting this movie back because we promised Kace. - Okay. Then we'll follow the instructions. - Don't deposit the check until next Monday. Everything should be okay. Good, good, I'm glad we could work this out, bubala. We'll do brunch and talk future goods and chattels. Chao baby! Shall we? - You're really good with accents. - Gracias. - That is really good Mexican. - Nobody home, should I leave a note? - Leave a note! - Welcome to St. Clair's Correctional Institute. Day one of your sentence is officially over. See ya! - Oh thank God, I just need to go to bed. - Nurse had to be my most delicate scalpel. - Doctor, what in God's name are you doing? - Surgery! - Hey, hey, hey, this is my room now, you can't do this. You have to leave. - Well, then I'll leave you alone, but first we have to help this woman, she's about to give birth. And as our newest addition, you should do the honors. - Okay, it. Done, yes, yes, yes! - It's magnificent. And you're saying an 11-year-old directed it? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, but we're the producers and we own it. - That's right, we own it, and we have the right copy. - She means copyright. - It's incredible. I'll have to have my partner see it. Do you think his partners are gonna love it? - Oh, I would love to take a look at it! You have an eye for talent, Mark Keen. My partner, Shmuel Kleinfelder, is interested. I'm gonna have Gloria set up another screening day. Yes Mr. Keen, you and Mr. Kleinfelder are both available this Thursday at noon. That's Christmas Day, I'll be hunting antelope with my girlfriend and her sister, Louise. It's our St. Valentine's ritual. I'm sorry Mr. Keen, I will definitely find another date. My people will contact your people. - Oh thank you. - And we will definitely work this out. - Thank you. - Oh, I loved it, but all these annoying beeps made me think my pacemaker was going off. - Can we go home now? I really want to play chutes and ladders. - Let's go. - We're gonna be rich. - Oh, yes we are. - I say you have to work for your money. Right form birth, no handouts, no freebies, form day one, why can't Americans do it? They do it in other countries, the animal kingdom does it, fish, bumblebees, they all start working right after they're born. Queen bees don't pamper their babies with bottles and rattles, no ma'am. They gotta start making honey right when they're hatched. Wait, the Congo government has just been overthrown, and an American Olympic wrestler apparently is at the center of it. Ajax Gabriel is headlining a wrestling tournament dubbed the Christmas coup in the Congo, which has turned into a real coup. After pinning several jungle beasts, and a few of the Congo's best wrestlers, the country's dictator, Bob Smith, challenged Gabriel to a wrestling match. Smith, most don't realize, illegally immigrated to the Congo with 1995 from Norway. Known to be on steroids, Smith has also been the Congo's bodybuilding champion since he forcibly took control of the nation in 2010. Well, now he is locked in a cage at the Congo's premier sports stadium. We've got play by play from South African sports network, BBD, live, when this all went down moments ago. - What's this? President Smith is beckoning Ajax Gabriel. I thought he was congratulating him, but no. He's taunting the American. The president is waving a tiger's tooth at Gabriel. That's Congo for "let's fight!" Well a fight, it's going to be. President Smith has ripped off his shirt. He is one muscular man, almost six feet five inches tall and weighing 255 pounds. Gabriel doesn't seem phased. Well, he did just pin three Congo national champs, and it was rather spectacular what he did to that giraffe. Here comes Smith onto the mat. I don't know what to expect. He's a frugal man. My God, Gabriel has immediately hit the president with a flying cradle! President Smith has been pinned it's three seconds! It's bedlam here. Military personnel are rushing the mat. The American may have some trouble. Gabriel is tossing Smith to the Congo soldiers. They might harass the American. I don't understand, the soldiers are handcuffing Smith, who violently fighting them. A whole militia has suddenly appeared in the stadium. Guns are pointed everywhere. Oh, I'm out of here. The giraffe and rhino were one thing, but this, this is a real military coup! Lancaster, you wimp. - I already won and Emmy. - Eh, British Sportscasters don't win Emmy's. You're- - This is George Scott reporting live from the Congo. President Bob Smith is now being rushed into an octagon mixed martial arts cage that abuts the wrestling mat where he was just pinned- - Oy vey. - By American Olympic champ, Ajax Gabriel. Gabriel is following the soldiers to the cage. He has just been joined by general General Gildas Ringo. Oh, wow! The generalist throwing a bucket of tomato sauce on Smith. That's the ultimate sign of disrespect in the Congo. The president is locked in the octagon cage covered in gravy. Gabriel is high fiving the general. It appears- - No, American Olympian, Ajax Gabriel, has assisted, maybe brainstormed the overthrow of a foreign dictator. It's dark in the Congo now after BBD sports caster, George Scott, cut out. No media has been able to report from the former communist country. All TV, radio, and internet access has been shut down. - Ajax, Agent Truman. Is that who you really are? - Cassandra, do you got that guy in the cage, or do we gotta go to the bank? - No, not without Ajax. - Nah, he's never gonna make it on time. - Shh, Kace could hear you, he's in the other room. - Eh, he's got his headsets on, he's fine. You know, you're really short change this kid. He's really bright. He knows what's goin' on. He knows how important this is. He knows the scenario that's happening. - Well, these thieves don't know how important this film is to us. Maybe we couldn't negotiate. - I disagree with you. They were on the set. They know exactly how important this was the Kace. - What would Ajax do? - Well, if he gets here on time, we'll find out. - Not now. - Yeah, maybe it's him. Maybe he got your text. - He's not gonna ring the bell. - Cassandra, what was your reaction when you heard the news? - It was on the news? Did you see it on the news? - Nope. - You know, to tell you the truth, we're not gonna let it ruin our Christmas one way or the other. - How could it not, what about Kace? - Kace is cool with it, and Kace is cool with it, then we all are. - I see, by the way, have you been able to talk to Ajax? - You know, my brother Ronald is here, and he's not gonna replace Ajax, of course, but he'll do until my husband gets home. - If he gets home. - You know what? Ajax has been in skirmishes like this before, and he always ends up on top, even with an animal like that. - Am I hearing this right? Cassandra is referring to president Bob Smith as a quote unquote, big animal. - That guy is jacked. - Communist dictator or not, he is still a human being. - What are you talking about? You're not talking about the movie. - No, I'm not talking about the movie. I am a journalist before I'm an actress, okay? Listen, Ajax is your husband, you don't seem to at least be concerned about him. - You know what, Kelly? I don't have time for this. Ajax wrestling and elephant on Christmas Eve is the least of my concerns. - Wait a minute, what? - Cassandra, you have to see what's on the news. - Oh, so you're a tough guy, huh? - Yeah, I'm tough like my dad. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, big guy, hey, you're Dad's gonna be all right, don't worry. - I know he is. - How do you know? - 'Cause I watch the news. - You know, I gotta start doin' that. - Yeah, Dad's with General Ringo who arranged for him to hold the Christmas coup in Congo. - Actually, it might be the other way around. - Huh? - I just got off the phone with the US Ambassador to Congo, and it seems that he fled the country on an alpaca. But Daddy is okay. He's staying with the general, but he's still scheduled to wrestle tomorrow night. But I can't get through to anyone in the Congo, all the communication lines are down. I think that Ajax is in the Congo for more than pinning Barnabas the Elephant. - What do I say if someone comes along? - It's not in here. - Hey, is that another accent? - The money's not in here. Let's get to the car. - Where we goin'? - Well, not to Mexico, not yet anyway. - How 'bout to Paris 'cause I always wanted to see the pyramids. - The pyramids aren't in Paris, they're in that country with, I don't know, King Tut. - Huh? - Cleopatra. - Oh, that's right, Egypt, where they got the Grand Canyon! - It's time to play tag, and they're it. - Open up in there! - Yeah, open the doh, we ain't foolin' around. - It's him. Hello Mr. German or Mr. English, whoever the heck you are today. - You think you're so smart. I give you specific directions to specific dumpster at specific time. - Yes, well we had some interceding issues. - Like your husband, wrestling dictators. - Listen! Ajax will tear you apart and then I will, okay? I know who you are. - Cassandra, calm down. - I know you know. - How do you know I know? - We all want Charlie to wake up, don't we Cassandra Gabriel? Listen closely. There is an office at 866 Prescott Street, Suite C. - Well, how do I know which one is Suite C? - Because it's marked suite C. - On the door? - No, on the roof. Yes, on the door. - Suite C? - Be there in exactly 23 minutes with the money. The front door to the office will be open. Open the door and put the bag of cash immediately to the right. Don't bring that doofus who's with you now. - Does he want to talk to me? - And if I don't come? - That's a beautiful white coat you're wearing Ms. Gabriel. - Oo, that is very pretty! - Would you shut up? - So you're watching us? - Stop trying to find me Mrs. G. You can't find me because I'm everywhere. - And right now, we're hiding in your brother's office. Oh my God. Listen here, Chucky Boy! - I'm hanging up now, Mrs. Gabriel. I hope to see you shortly. You know where and you know when. And by the way, I notice your son isn't with you. - Yeah! - He still doesn't want to talk to me? - Kace is not picking up. - They're not kidnappers Cass. - How do you know? They stole a hard drive. That leads to kidnapping. - Hey, what about Singapore? I hear that's real nice. Unless you spit chewing gum on the ground or somethin'. What do you think? Chuckles, what do you think? What do you think? - Call Tricia. - If he was a Charlie's he would have his phone. - Wherever he is, he's gonna have his phone. - Then go to Charlie's. - Okay, it's here, here. Is Kace here? - Yeah, he's upstairs with Charlie. - Oh good! - And he said her butt was bigger than King Kong's. I don't think I ever laughed so hard. I almost spit my soda out. - I ain't playin' around any more. - I just wanna go home, and play with our Christmas presents. - What a great idea, Ms. Kitty Kat. - Really? Really, I have a great idea? - A brilliant idea. Let's go home and play with our Christmas presents. - Oh, thanks Chucky. - Did you ever watch Superman, Mom? - I watch him all the time. - You mean Dad? - Well, I mean Dad, but I also mean you. - Mom, I want you to know that you're Superman too. - Superman? - Superwoman, just as strong. - Well, maybe not quite as strong. - But just as good, and just as smart. - I didn't get your movie back yet. Did you meet with the the Wiener today? - Yeah, well, I think you could say that we missed him. - He's like a slippery hot dog. - Yeah, with ketchup and mustard. - Mom, I'm not worried. - Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, and the very next day Charlie will wake up. I know everything is going to work out well. Kace, do you remember when you were seven years old and you really wanted a spaceship for Christmas? - I was seven, Mom. - Yes, and when there wasn't a real spaceship under the Christmas tree on Christmas day, you were so disappointed. Having hope, it's wonderful, and having faith in Charlie is admirable, but- - I have faith in Dad and in you too. - So do I. So, you'll do grandma and grandpa's tomorrow? - Okay, Mom. And Dad, hear me across the world. Let's be the Super family and make this the best Christmas ever for Charlie, even if you could only help by prayer. - The Congo owes it's freedom to General Ringo and Ajax Gabriel. I am told that communication will return to this newborn nation by Christmas Day, which would be a miracle. In the meantime, might we ask who really is Ajax Gabriel? Is he an Am- - Hello Chuck Wiener and Kitty Kat of 1450 Route 22- - Game over Cassandra. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, tomorrow I get what I want for Christmas, and hopefully case will get what he's asking Santa for. - You will get your money, but you will never, ever beat us! - I got hand it to you Gabriel, you got chutzpah. - We have faith. - You have stupidity. I don't think you know how serious this is. There's no copywriter copies of the movie. And it's a good movie, my hat's off to the kid, but it's our movie and it's our fortune. And one way or another, I'm gonna get what I want. - Why don't you just keep the film and get it distributed? - Because I want the money now. It's easier, I get it in one fell swoop. You should appreciate that. If I keep the movie, my fortune awaits, yours never comes, and when Charlie doesn't wake up, poor Charlie, poor Kace. - Get to the point. - We pay ball on your court. Now get paper and pen and follow my directives with the precision of kamikaze fighter pilot. - Cass, I know you want the police involved, but these Germans- - I just think his last accent was Haitian or something- - I think Wiener is German. - Well what about Kitty Kat? - Korean, Swiss mix? - Really, I just think they're broke actors. Although, they were pretty good in the film. - Yeah, whatever they are, they're like one step ahead of us. I mean, they have the hard drive. They can wipe it clean anytime they want. This Wiener guy says this is the last thing, this is the last choice. We have no chance, we've got to do it. - You know, I've thought a lot about what Ajax would do. - Well, Ajax would probably say do the exact same thing is what I'm sayin' and tellin' you to do. Just pay him, take care of it, get back the movie, and that's that. - Really, you don't think the police should know what's happening? - Sure, we can tell the police and Charlie doesn't wake up. - I don't know. Ajax wouldn't give up. - Ajax, Ajax, my shadow. - What are you talking about? - You know, sis, this is the last straw, okay? For once I'm gonna be the hero. I'm gettin' back this movie. - Ronald! Don't go. Ajax. - Cassandra. - Ajax can you hear me? I can't really hear you. Ajax, can you hear me? I'm here. Ajax. - Cassandra. - Oh, Ajax, I, I really need you here. I need my partner. It's Kace, he's okay, but that idiot Wiener from the movie, he played Dr. McShea. And my stupid Ronald, he didn't make copies of the film, and now Wiener and his girlfriend, they, they, they took the movie and they want a million dollars to give it back. Ajax, I took the money from your protein shake commercials, and your sports gambling. Ajax, are you okay? Ajax? And Kace, he's so confident that everything's gonna turn out well with Charlie, and, and this miracle he's been talking about, it's gonna happen. And that Charlie's gonna hear this movie, and he's gonna laugh and he's gonna wake up. Kace has so much faith. So it just comes down to tonight, Christmas Eve and they want to meet us at our very special place. Ajax, are you still there, hello? - You know, that was really nice of your brother to close the restaurant on Christmas Eve. You know, it's just kind of spiritual. - Like they do in Afghanistan on Christmas. - Yeah, and it was awful nice of him to let us sleep here after dinner last night. 'Cept the food was kind of icky. That was not very good Chinese food at all. - That's because it's Ital. We're German! - Ready? - Ah, I was born ready. - Let's do this. - Are you ready? - Ms. Kitty Kat, I was born ready. - Oo, oh! - When I spelled the word bear, you throw the million dollar money back, we throw the box with the hard drive. - Well, why can't you just count to five? - Or say, "A, B, C, D, E." - Yeah, that would be easier. - Oh my God, shut up everyone. It's when I spell the word bear. - Hold on. When she throws the hard drive, isn't it gonna break? - Duh, we wrapped it all up in bubble wrap, and we're throwin' it on a wrestlin' mat. - Now, I'm spelling the word bear. Get ready to throw the bag. B-E-A-R. - Wait a minute, that's not how you spell bare. Bare is B-A-R-E. - It's not bare in the cupboard. This is bear in the woods. - How am I supposed to know that? - It's just bear. - But bare in the cupboards, or like bear in the woods? - Okay, fine, bare in the cupboard, B-A-R-E! - That is bare in the cupboard. - Throw the bag. - Oowee! That's looks like a billion bucks to me, baby. - What is this? - It looks like a sandwich! - It's a chicken salad sandwich on a Portuguese roll. Is that R-O-L-L, or R-O-L-E, baby? - It's a sandwich roll, R-O-L-L, you buffoon. - You are not going to cross us. We come from a wrestling family. - Stay right there Cassandra, don't move or I'll blow you to smithereens. - With what? A canister of tennis balls? - This is no ordinary can of tennis ball. - No it ain't, missy. - These are explosives wrapped in tennis balls. - Uh huh, you got that little girl? - And they're aimed right at you. - Right at you, little flower child. - Will you shut up, so I can explain this? If I take the lid off, a ball with burst out and hit you. And when it does, bang, and you're nothin' but dust. - I don't believe you. How can an actor think of such a bomb? No, he's hardly an actor. - All right, do you know how that sounds? It makes me sound like I'm a crappy actor. - No, no, I mean, you're kinda good, pretty good. I mean, I mean, he's not the best, but he's decent. - Okay, what she means is is before I was an actor, a great actor, I was a special effects artist. - Nonsense! - No, wait, wait, no. He was! Ajax told me he hired Wiener to do that, the French kids wrestling thingy thingy. - You mean the diaper dance in France? - Yes, and I was a Marine. - And he was in the Army and he was in the Navy and he was even in the Guard Coast - That's right, and much more than that. But right now, stay still, or you'll get the hardest tennis backhand of your life. Now, we're taking the money and the movie. - Mhmm, that's right. And we are gonna sell that movie on the internet. It's gonna be a one them digital things that you can't even trace us down in Mexico where we're going to be. - You idiot. You just narrowed it down where we're gonna be. Now we have to change our plans. - Freeze, you dim-witted dumbbells! - Yeah, freeze, freeze! - Ronald, I got her. Help Ajax and point the gun at Wiener. I don't mean weapon to help me with this triple bozo! - I, I thought you were wrestling the elephant tonight? - That elephant chickened out, he was a socialist, maybe even a communist. - But you at least helped overthrow that Congo dictator, right honey? - Baby, you know that's classified, but maybe I'll tell you over a cold beer and some bacon wrapped scallops! - Will you shut up? - Ronald, what are you doing? - Just put the gun down, sis, and everything'll be fine. - Who's the barbells now, huh? - Sis, you know, there's a million dollars in that bag. Between that and the black market of the movie, I'm gonna be set for life and I don't have to live in your shadows any more. This time I'm the hero, not him. - I'll hit you with that special spladle, Ronald, and then I'll souffle you into a dirt nap! - Not this time Ajax. - Listen to your brother. Put the gun down. He's my step-brother. - Step-brother, wait, I always wondered why she was so pretty, and he was so... - Fluffy. - Brother, step-brother, who cares? Ajax, you can't win this one. Tell your wife to put the gun down. Tell your wifey to give it up. - Put it down Cassandra. - Yes, a million dollars split three ways, 250 apiece. - That's 333,000 and change for each of you, dumb head. - You! Over there! - Good job, Kace. Kace! - Off to the shadows of a prison cell world. - Ronald's gun was a fake. He took it from my toy collection. - No, Kace, that's a bomb! - This is no bomb, it's a can of tennis balls. This goofball's no Marine or even a special effects artist. He was a lawyer before he was an actor. - Yeah, and that's why I'm gonna argue my way out of this, you little bully. I was a great lawyer. - Oh, and he was a good attorney. - Kitty. - And he was a judge. - Kitty Kat. - And he's a really good mouthpiece. - Enough! Kitty Kat. - Squad, let's house these fools. - Oh! - Ajax, what's going on? - Let's just say, we're havin' a little justice here tonight in the wrestling room, Ajax-style. And then these clowns are gonna have a good little ten-year prison sojourn in the Congo. Let's roll! - Hey Chuck, is the Congo in Mexico? - You know, mouthpiece is not a complimentary term for a lawyer. - Aw! There goes my money. - Yes, I've got you now Dr. Stone. - Ope, comin' through! Little pep in your step, hustle! - What's going on? - This is an emergency. - Okay, okay. You know I'm a psychiatrist! - Well, say it. - Yes? Uh, oh, uh, oh, clear! - Clear! It's not working. You try. - But I've never done this. What do I do? What do I do? Oh. - Clear. - Right. Oh, it worked! - I'm back. - Dr. Lemon, Dr. Lemon are you there? - Yes. - Okay, look at me, answer without thinking. Is there a God? - I still can't tell. - You know what that means? Take a shot. - Woo! - So, Dr. Stone, right? You wanna try... - There's my bad girl. Agent Truman I didn't know you were here. That is a serious invasion of my privacy. - That's the evidence against Dr. Stone? A crazy patient's ramblings during a psychiatric appointment? - She is not an ordinary patient. That is Dr. Mia Boreo, a renowned neurosurgeon, and also the former roommate at the medical school of Dr. Stone. I assure you when she is caught, she'll be right here along side Dr. Stone. - Maybe when she gets here she'll remove the other half of your brain. - Are you still the sensei at Cobra Kow? No mercy! Sweep the leg! - Kace, he just needs a little more time, but he heard it and I bet he was laughing. - Kace, do you want some time alone with Charlie? We can go put desert on the table. - Yes, please, that would be really nice. - Kace, you are absolutely the most wonderful and best friend Charlie could ever have. I am very proud of you. - It was one crazy story to get this movie back. The bumblefoots who played Dr. McShea and Dr. Joyner were the ones who stole it. But worse, my Uncle Ronald was in on it all along with them. I always knew he was a loser. He's actually not even related to me. He's my mom's step-brother, but turns out he was always jealous of my dad. Speaking of my dad, wanna hear a secret? Now I'm not supposed to tell anyone this Charlie, but you are my best friend and loyalty is the most important word in the dictionary, so I'll tell you. My dad is in the CIA and he orchestrated the overthrowing of the dictator of the Congo. Some loser steroid named Bob Smith, and he turned the country into a democracy like America. Now, since I'm givin' away secrets, wanna I know my family's secret wrestling move? it's called the Gabriel spladle with a soup ladle. Now don't show anyone this move Charlie. This is how you do it. After you've peeled back the guy's forearm, you lock his head. Process the movie, gone. - It's our movie now. - A million dollars to give us back that hard drive. No, Kace, that's a bomb! - Now this will either put the guy to sleep or wake him up- - Uh Kace, could you get off me? - Charlie, you woke up! - Thank you for getting off me. I had some of the craziest dreams. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my dear God. - It's a miracle! It's a true Christmas miracle!
