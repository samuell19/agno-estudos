Halló. Ertu leigubíl... Uh... I speak English, you know. - Most of us do. - Okay. Thank God. - Um, are you working? - Uh, yes, sir. Where do you wanna go? Um... Where do people go? Uh, what do you mean? Like when they, uh, fly in, where do most people go? Uh, most people go to the capital, you know, Reykjavik. - Okay. - Yeah, to their hotels and... - Okay, cool, yeah, let's do that. - All right. Uh, do you have any bags or... No, I didn't really plan this trip. I just had to get away. Uh, your name, sir? Benny M-Miller. How many guests will be staying in your room? Just one. Also want to mention that our water is geothermally heated. Many guests are asking why it smells like sulfur. - So, it's normal, heh. - Okay. Goddamn it. Ugh! Fuck. Yeah, it smells like farts. ♪ Can't believe I love someone so cruel... ♪ Ahem. ♪ Cuando cali... ♪ ♪ Cuando calienta el sol aquí en la playa ♪♪ Baby, you promised we could go to Iceland. Oh, yeah? Tastes like... lipstick. Oh, my God. No, it doesn't. It's gum. - Okay, come here. - Mmm. What the fuck am I doing here? Loftur. Folktales about magic in Iceland go back a thousand years to the first Viking settlers. And while we enjoy the freedom of religion today, many have been burned at the stake for their belief in sorcery in the past. Now, most of the magic used by everyday people were simple symbols, or staves, but some stories talk about mysterious black spells. One of the most famous Icelandic stories is about a magic student named Loftur, who craved to know all the spells he could. And after he exhausted the knowledge of the day, Loftur decided he wanted to learn ancient secrets by raising someone from the dead. He performed a powerful and complicated spell, now known as Loftur's Spell, which was said to contain magic so strong he could control Satan himself. He chanted and drew runes in the blood of a murdered man. He carved a stave on his chest. And many of us say... ...he will one day return and complete his spell. Sir? Sir? Are you all right, sir? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Uh, yeah, I just have this, uh, condition. Uh, sorry. I'm gonna find a... pharmacy. I think I found Loftur. So, as I was saying... This is, uh, Benny Miller calling for Dr. Haskell. If you can give me a call back, that would be great. Um, they're not renewing my prescription, which is frustrating 'cause my OCD is getting a bit out of control. And I'm in Iceland, which should make this whole process infinitely harder. Thanks. What's the, uh, Icelandic term for self-medicating? I don’t know... Yeah. Here's to that. Yeah, man, you don't wanna mess with diabetes 'cause that'll, like, go through your whole family, yo. Ah! Excuse me. I’m so sorry. Oh, sorry, I don't speak, uh, Icelandic. Oh, okay. I was just saying I'm sorry. We've been yelling in your ear and now I'm spilling your drink. - I'm so sorry. - Oh, no. It's okay. - Let us buy you a drink. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - We'll buy you a drink. - No. Yeah, yeah, of course. We were about to have a round of Landi. Yeah, it's like real... "Lanthy"? Landi... it's like real Icelandic moonshine. - I mean, sure. - Yeah, let's do it. All right. Skal. Skal! Skal! Skal! Holy shit! Was that poison? That was terrible! What? You didn't like it? No! Oh! Let's do some more! Yeah! Skal! Skal! Skal! Okay, okay. - It's Björn, Hildur... - Yeah. Vagn and Inga... So, what are you doing here? Um, I don't know. Just hanging out in the city, I guess. He should go with Steindór, of course. Yeah! What is a "Stink door"? "Steindór." He's this crazy old man. He gives private tours to tourists and shows you shit no tourists ever get to see. You'll love it. Love it. - Do it in the morning! - No! He has a seriously cool cabin by a waterfall. You know what? I'll email him, just right now. No, hold on. Wait, no. I don't know if I... Do it! Come on. Do it. Fuck it. I'm in. - To Steindór! - Yeah, Steindór! - Steindór! - There you go! Yeah. Guys! Shall we go? Okay. I’m going to stay. With this guy? What’s with you tonight? You’re acting all weird. Just go, alright? I’m fine. Is everything okay? Huh? Yeah, yeah, they're just leaving. - Okay. - All right. Bye. - All right, we'll see you. - Are you gonna go or... - We have to finish our game, right? Okay. Oh, now that you've stolen my guy. - And... yup. - You're a thief. - And now he died. - Yeah, so you lose. Okay, that's fair. I'm sorry. It's okay. We should take a walk. All right? Okay... okay. You're sure? I swear Björn is not a serial killer. Those glasses are so bad. I know. Hey, you got any tattoos? Uh, yeah, I have seven. What? Yeah, but they're all where you can't see them. Oh, okay. Well, now I have a new goal in life. Do you think I was giving you a challenge? Yes. Oh, my God. You Americans are so confident. - How many do you have? - None. - Ohh. - Yeah. I've never liked one enough to get it. Oh... Well, how about this? If you get one right here, right now, I will show you one of mine. Do I get to pick which tattoo? - No. - Okay. Then I'm gonna need to see at least five of your tattoos. Ah... three. Three is not enough. - 31/2. - Yeah? 31/2? Yeah. Let's get me a goddamn tattoo. Oh, my God. Okay. I mean, the skull Viking, right? Yeah. These are really popular with the tourists. Oh, well, I don't want that. I don't want a tourist one. I might as well get a barbed wire tattoo. Um, I know... I know what you should get. - What? - I have something that I was just looking at the other day. It's like old-school Icelandic. Let me show you. This. - Oh, cool. - Have you seen it? Yeah, what are they? What are they? It's called staves. Oh, yeah. I saw these at the... uh, this magic museum I went in yesterday. Oh, yeah? They all mean stuff, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, but just different stuff. This is, like, to reveal a thief. This is, like, to... to keep your cow's milk from curses. Yeah, I don't want cursed cow milk. I should probably do that one. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Go back. That one. That one? Why? I don't know. It just kinda speaks to me. What does it mean? Um... it's for good luck. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, done. Let's do it. Is this gonna hurt? Nei. Aah! Does he know what that means? Yeah, yeah. Yup, of course he knows. - All right. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Aah! Hey, so when does it stop, uh, hurting so bad? Just soon. Yeah, well, I'm not afraid to tell you that sucked and I hated it. Oh, geez. - I couldn't tell. - Hey, um... - Pay up. - What? 31/2 tattoos. Pay up. Right here? Now? - Mm-hmm. All right, you get one. Okay, I'll take it. Well, come over. I'm not gonna show it to the whole town. Sorry. Yeah. That's a good one. Oh, my God! Holy shit! - Sorry. - It's okay. Um, can we go to your place? I have a roommate. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, we can go to my hotel. I have no idea where it is. Shut up. Okay. Here it is. Um, I need to pee, so... Oh, yeah, it's... it's the room, uh, without a bed in it. Right. Shit. Uh, hey! I just realized, um, I don't have a condom. Uh, not that I was assuming I'd need one. It's just, um... yeah, yeah, yeah. I just didn't expect to meet anybody, although I'm glad I did, because, um... you're very hot and pretty and nice and... ...your accent's cool. So, I have one. Oh, that's good. Yeah. How fortunate. Do you have any good playlists? Yeah, I have a million of 'em. Mmm. Let's see... All right. Oh, I see where you're going. You are wearing so many clothes. We should probably take off a lot of these clothes. Yeah. Could be dangerous. There are those tattoos I keep hearing about. You talk a lot. I'm sorry. I talk so much. Wait, no. I want these on. - You sure? - Yeah. Wait. Sorry. Hold on. Wait.

There was a whole thing with teenagers and ketchup. I don't... I'm having a rough day. Okay. Get in the truck. Okay, here's the thing, though. I got your name from a woman named Inga, and she told me to meet you, and she also turned out to be this psychopath who stole a bunch of important shit from me. And so, all I need to know from you is if you know Inga. Yes, I know her. Inga can be... impulsive. Yeah. No shit. Um, can I please get her phone number from you? I will talk to her. She will return what she took from you. Okay, good. Good. Thank you. When do you think this will happen? When I'm back from this trip. Few days. Okay, but I don't need to go on the trip now, so we can... we can do it now, though. I'm going with or without you. But you should go. See the island. No one has ever regretted it. Then we will return. You will get your things back. Where do you go? - North. - Yeah? You eat what I make, sleep when I say. And what do you see? Beautiful things. I mean, is it cool? Very cool. Ohh... okay. Fuck it. Hey, can we listen to some music? Are we getting out? I guess we're getting out. Be very careful. Okay, don't go too far. You'll fall. What is this place? This is actually the old parliament. Althingi. The old clans, the families came from the country to this place once a year. Eh, it's just a bunch of flies now. Stupid Americans. - Hmm? - Nothing. Let's go. So, is it just gonna be mainly just driving around, looking at stuff? I mean, that sounds cool, I guess, but maybe not that interesting, for me. I just... I don't know. I feel like maybe if there was bungee-jumping or parasailing or something, that sounds fun, but... I don't know. Nature might not do it for me. - Yeah! Ha ha! - Don't get too close. Be careful. Very dangerous. Here, take a photo of me in front of it. Why would you want to ruin a photo of something beautiful by placing your fat head in front of it? Okay, well, "A," ouch. And "B," because it's fun. Have you... Have you experienced this feeling before? Fun? I have fun. Doing what? Making money. Okay, I will pay you 1,000 kronors for each picture you take of me, all right? Now I'm having fun. Do it when I jump. Ready? Yeah. Did you get it? Yeah. You get it? - Again. - Okay, one, two, three! Yeah. - You get it? - Got it. How'd it come out? Ah, this is so gross! One picture of them. - No. - Please. - No. - They're birds, man. - They're just... - No, no. Shit! Steindór! Steindór, what am I doing wrong?! Hey, take a picture of me on top of this thing. - No. - Why not? Not everything is to be climbed, to be mocked. This is a sacred stone. This is a runestone. Sorry. Didn't mean to, uh, offend. What's a runestone? Ancient writings. Oh, yeah, Inga was showing me those. It tells the story of those who lived here. Died here. It's marked by magic. It's powerful. Yeah? You believe all that stuff? Magic? Of course I do. How does it work? How does what work? Magic. Like, where does the power come from? Is it, uh, God? Or spirits? Or, uh, I don't know, the moon? Haven't you heard of Einstein? Yeah, I've heard of Einstein. "B" equals MC squared. Physical mass is just energy in another state. We are made of energy. That's it? That's kind of, like, simplifying the whole thing. I had to dumb it down for you. How does you being way over there, say something, and then me, an autonomous person way over here, do it? Where does that power... How does that work? If I do a spell, right now, and it works, will you shut up for the next hour or so? Yeah. Yes. Abracadabra, hocus pocus, you will imagine a spider crawling through your hair. Okay. So dumb. It's so dumb. But here's the thing. It's only working because you put that in my head. And that's how magic works. Now shut up. Let's go. So, we're sleeping in there? Like, both of us? Yup. Or you can sleep in the tent. "Or you can sleep in the tent.

So, this is a glacier? - What do you think it is? - I don't know. Looks like snow and ice. What do you think a glacier is made out of? You know, you're like the least-friendly tour guide ever. Most of them are polite and kind to their clients. They don't just growl at them with foreboding eyes. Come on. Just climb. Be careful. Don't fall in. Don't fall into what? Don't find out. It's amazing. I mean, I don't know what the difference between ice and a glacier is. A glacier is ice that moves under its own weight. It's unstoppable. Yeah, this is weird. I have these... compulsions. They used to be okay, but then they got worse, um, a while ago. Now they get worse even more when I'm off my medication and stressed. Which sucks 'cause... they're hard to control. Then don't. Then don't what? Don't control 'em? That's great. Then just walk around looking like a freak? That's good. You don't know what you're talking about. "That's good." Fuck you. Every ten fucking minutes, I have this thought that pops into my head. "Hey, stick something in your ear. "Find something long, and sharp, "and stick it an inch and a half in your left ear. And do it! Do it now! Do it!" I have to willingly push this thought away, and then, ten minutes later, it comes back! It's okay. It's okay. Come here. I want to show you something. Put your fingers in the snow. For what? Humor me. Don't control them. Look. What the fuck is that? This has been with my family for centuries. My father gave it to me, and his father gave it to him. What good is it to stand up to a glacier? It will go where it pleases. A mountain can stand in its way with all its might... but if a glacier wants... it will break that mountain. You cannot control something. You can only destroy it. Jess! Jess? Jess... Jess! Hey, hey! Uhh! Hey! Hey, hey! You're okay. You're okay. Hey! What? Nothing. What? What are you drawing? Oh, it's just something for work. I've seen it before. You've seen this? That's Stumpy. From "Psketti"? You know "Psketti"? Of course I know Psketti, and his little dog, Ketchup. Yeah, man, I draw "Psketti." No, no, no. That's drawn by Glen Bean. No, Glen Bean died 20 years ago, and then his son started drawing it, but then he died of diabetes, and then it was this lady, Diane Ketchup, strangely enough, but she couldn't draw for shit, so now I draw "Psketti." Glen Bean is dead? From diabetes, actually. I guess it's genetic. So, now I just copy his style and do his characters and make dumb jokes. It's... It's sad. I'm very impressed. We didn't know this about you. Who's we? What? Uh, Icelanders. That it's not Glen Bean. Uh, I mean, I don't know, I think it's actually pathetic. I'm a grown man. I should be drawing my own comic strip. No, I should be drawing my own comic book. That's what I wanna do. That's what Jess said I should do, but... I don't know. I don't think I'm good enough. So, here I am copying a dead man's style. No, this is a beautiful thing. A man wants greatness, so he completes the work of another great man. I mean... I don't know if I'd call this greatness, but... thank you so much. This is right. What are you talking about? Nothing. We're almost here. Hey, man... I don't think I can do another long-ass hike today. It'll be the last one, I promise you. Oh, we're going in. Come on. I didn't bring a bathing suit or anything. You didn't bring one either. Come on. Stop being so American. This is gonna be straight-up gross. Gah! I think three rocks just went inside me. Yeah... I'm sitting in a hot springs... in Iceland... naked... with a creepy old man drinking vodka. This is... very weird. But nice, yes? It is nice. Skal! Where did you get that? Hmm? Oh, this. This was a gift from Inga. Did she choose it? Mm-mm. She showed me a bunch of designs, and I liked it, so I chose it. Let me guess. It doesn't mean "good luck"? What is that? This is Loftur's stave. She made me get the magic guy's secret stave? You just said you chose it. Well, then she steered me into it or something. No, you chose it on purpose. Oh, I did? Part of you did. Okay, explain to me how that works. How part of my brain could know secret knowledge that the rest of me doesn't know? How does a baby, knowing nothing, look for her mother's nipple? That's instinct. That's... that's the subconscious. That's different. You're the one with a powerful stave written on his chest, whose fingers are tracing out a language he doesn't understand. Okay. But I am not choosing to do any of this. No, you're too busy controlling. You refuse to choose. We must keep doing it for you. What are you talking about? You sound crazy. But this is the last time. Okay. Relax. Come on, I don't want whatever this is. Stop... stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Come on! Choose! Choose! Choose! Unh! Aah! I'll fuckin' hit you! I'll fuckin' hit you! Come on! Shit! Aaagh! Stop! Uhh! Ahh! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Back off! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, fuck. Fuck. Okay. Um... fuck. Um... ahh... fuck. Oh, fuck. Hey! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Move! Where the fuck did you come from? Uh, I think he's got, like... Steindór! Steindór! I think he has, like water in his lungs or something. He, uh, we're, uh... He's down there and he came at me, and fuck! Did you bring everything? Steindór, Steindór! Hey, hey! What are you doing? What... - Are you all right, man? - Back off! Hey, are you all right? Okay... It’s all ready. Dude, that's my fucking hair! What the... Why is... Is that my fucking jizz?! Hey! Come on! What?! Stop! No! Fuck! What the fuck is happening, man? What the fuck is happening?! Listen, okay, listen, I don't know what you people want, or what the fuck you're doing, but I just want to go home, okay? - Shut up! - I just wanna go home!

You are Loftur, are you not? We've been waiting for you a very long time. Heh. We've done everything we could. Now the rest is on you. Your answers lie that way. Follow the runestones.

I don't fuckin' know his name. And, um, fuck this. Okey-dokey. Well, we have entered the Mordor part of the island now. Ever tell you I was raised very Christian? Yeah, I told you that. You know that. Ahem! Which means I never learned how to draw a woman's body. It was shameful. I was always embarrassed, so I decided, hey, I'm a professional artist. And a grownup. I should learn this. I should know this. So I took this life drawing class... where, you know, people draw a nude model. So I go in, and I'm... excited... to finally be doing this and see a nude model. And then out comes this man. Like a middle age man. Like, he could've been... Looked like the manager of a TJ Maxx. And he got naked and he sat down. Oh, and he just opened his legs, and... all I could see was his balls. There were many balls, so much balls. There was this little girl next to me, she's just smiling and drawing it. So I was like, "Oh, I wanna do this." Ah, so I drew his balls. It was so bad. And they go, "Hey, we're taking a break. We'll change positions." So I got up, I moved to the other side of the room and she followed me. And then the guy came back, and he rotated and aimed his balls at me again! I can't draw his balls. I look over and she's just laughing. Gives me a wink, and I said, "Fuck it, I'm in." And I fully embraced his balls, just drawing 'em. Going to town. Oh, my God, it was so freeing. Just drew balls for the next hour and a half. Just staring right into the sun and drawing it. Ahh... Best $40 I ever spent. And that was how I met Jess. Yeah, she would always do that. She would make me so uncomfortable. Oh, my God, and I loved it. I hated it, but I loved it. Yeah. I think we were supposed to take more classes after that, but we didn't. I guess she didn't want to. Or at least she chose not to. We just want to make sure that all her things stay with the family. Sorry, son. Now, I went down to the medical examiner's office. They released Jess's personal effects. This is the jewelry... that Jess was wearing when she passed. Have you thought about what you're gonna do with Jess's body? We should call the funeral home about embalming. There's a family plot in Sacramento. She can be buried with her grandparents there. There should be a Christian service. I'm sure Reverend Green from Holy Baptist Church will be happy to do it. I don't know this Reverend Green. Well, I can assure you that he would do a lovely job. No. Excuse me? No. I mean, a Christian funeral? She's a practicing Buddhist. You know how she dabbles... She wanted to be cremated. She told you that three separate times. Benny, I know this is an emotional time for everyone. And, Jesus Christ, embalming? She's a vegan! She only ate fucking organic, and you're telling me that Jess's last wish is for somebody to put her on a metal table and then fill her veins with formaldehyde? I mean... Yeah, you people. You can take whatever you want, but don't pretend that you knew her. One. One. One. And one... One Republic. Then you got U2. Uh, Three Doors Down. Four... Four Tops. Jackson 5. Eve 6. Avenged Sevenfold. Eight is, um... Eight... Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Ohh! Aww! Come on! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I can do this. I can do this. Okay. Oh! Shit! Okay... Unh! Oh, I'm done. Oh, I'm done. Yeah, you hear me? Agh, I'm not gonna do your treasure map anymore. Just so you know. Ohh. I'm not gonna... not gonna do a fucking... I'm not chasing any more runestones! Aaaargh! I'm not gonna do your goddamn spell anymore! My name is not Loftur! My name is Benny Miller! My name is Benny Miller! My name is Benny Miller! My name is Benny Miller! My name is Benny... My name is... My name is Benny... My name is Benny. My name is Benny. My name is Benny... Oh, no, no, no. No! No! Which side... Which side were you on? Where, which side? I don't know which direction! Yeah. Huh? Do it. Come on, that's it. You win. Oh... You want some tea? I can get it. The mugs are on the second one. Okay. The tea is in the little... thing. Oh, we only have chamomile... sorry. That's fine. You like chamomile now? No. There's hot water on the stove. Thanks. There's sugar in the back by the tea box. So, what the fuck is happening right now? You tell me. Are you... Is this real? It feels pretty real. You know, the only thing people eat in this country is lamb and pickled fish? I mean, a vegan would just starve. Are you okay? I'm better than I was. Did it hurt? It didn't feel good. It was cold, I guess. It was... can we not talk about it? Sorry. I don't know what to say. Maybe start with "hi"? That's good. Okay. Hi. Hi. I've missed you. I missed you too, buddy. Can I... can I kiss you? Why wouldn't you? I don't know what the fuck is happening right now. You smell really good. Thank you. You're really here, huh? I am. So, what do we do now? You wanna fuck? No. What? Why? No, I mean, of course I do, yes. Okay, so okay. It's just, can we do it in a little while? - 'Cause this is a lot to... - Yeah. ...wrap my head around. I... totally. Also, you've never been dirtier. - Oh, right? No, I'm disgusting. - So filthy! And plus, all the showers here smell like farts. Oh, wait, this is an island surrounded by fart water, the whole thing. What is wrong with these people? I don't know. Hey, can we, um... maybe sit? I've just been running around all day licking rocks. Oh, you're still licking? Yeah. So, what's new? Oh, uh... well, I can do magic now. Wait, I saw that. - What is going on with that? - Mm-hmm. You are looking at an ancient Icelandic wizard named Loftur. I am? Or possibly his protégé. It is not quite clear. Oh, just so fancy! Oh, it's very fancy, yes. Oh, okay. I mean, that does make sense for you, though. It goes with all your control stuff. Oh, God, Jess... It does, because you are a person who loves to control stuff, and now you can control sort of, you know, mysterious powers. Okay. Are you ready to fuck yet? I'd say I'm 45 to 50% there. Jesus, what's a girl gotta do? All right, well, I got a good idea in the meantime. Yeah? Ben Folds Five plus One Direction equals what? Sixpence None the Richer. Oh, it's not even fun. You're too good at it! Yeah, I've had literally nothing else to do but think of these. Okay, you want one? Yeah, give me one. Okay, 2 Live Crew... - Uh-huh. - ...times Powerman 5000. 10,000 Maniacs! - I got good at this! - That's my girl. - There she is. - Yes! You remember when, um... when we were in Ojai, and we got in that huge fight about whether Seven Mary Three was 10 or 73? Yes, I remember. That's when you broke that window. What window? The window. When you, uh, got drunk and did your thing and broke the giant window in the front? Hmm. What do you mean "did my thing"? So what does that even mean? You did your thing, the Jess thing, where you'd, uh... drink or take pills and then... go out of your mind and turn into this tornado. Until you'd passed out. You know... the thing. That's how you remember me? That is... that's part of it. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Well, that doesn't seem very fair. How is that not fair? Hmm? You would do those things. All the time. I know. Then what? Fine, then, "Jess the Fuck-up." There's a million ways I've always ruined everything. No, that is not what I was saying. I'm sorry, Benny. I had no control, okay? I'm an addict. No... You can't use that. You can't use that anymore. - Use what? - The addict card. God, you would always use that to get out of everything. "Hey, Jess, you wrecked the car." "Ah, don't yell at me. I'm an addict." - I never said that. - "Hey, Jess, my boss caught you stealing his oxy at the dinner party." "Hey, it's not my fault. I'm an addict." Why are you saying this? Because ya stomped on my life! On our life! Doing whatever the fuck you wanted with this ironclad excuse! And I couldn't say shit to that! "Ah, it's a sickness. I'm helpless." Hey, I was fucking helpless! Okay? Do you think I'm proud of that? Do you think that I loved lying to you? That I enjoyed sneaking around and disappointing every person in the whole fuckin' world? My parents? Benny... Saying I'm an addict is an admission that I am a fuck-up! It is not an excuse! And it's not an excuse! Because you chose. You chose to leave me! Benny... What do you think happened that night? What do I think happened? You drowned. Great. But how did I drown? Why are you asking me? You're the one who got fucked-up and walked into a pool. But why? I don't know. I don't... fucking know! I don't know! Why would you do that? Why would you just leave without giving me a note? F... Fuck you! Jess... fuck... you for that. I didn't mean to leave you, Benny. No? Then how come you killed yourself? I didn't. I didn't wanna die. I had my whole life. I had you. What are you saying to me? That... that it was an accident? Yeah. No, it was. I know... that... I left you, and I know, and I'm so sorry. No, baby, I'm sorry. And I'm so sorry. - No, I am. I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. No, I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid and I fuckin' ruined everything. No, shut up with that. Shut up. - I'm such a fuckin' idiot. - No, don't say that. - Hmm... - It doesn't matter, okay? None of that matters, right? 'Cause we can go home now. Benny, go home? We can go home? You're back. Come on. What do you think this is? I did this spell. I did... I did Loftur's spell, and you're back now. What?! Oh, fuck! Oh. You thought that was gonna be enough? And the two struggled against each other for hours, until the very church around them crumbled to the ground. Loftur knew he was not powerful enough to take control. Loftur fled to the ocean. Benny... Benny. Benny. Oh, my God, I'm gonna lose you again. Benny, your ear. You don't have to go, okay? You can stay if you want. You don't have to go. You can stay! Did it work? Did you see her? The spell isn't finished. You cannot control something. You can only destroy it. Did you finish it? Are you him? You're so close. Go the water. Finish the spell. Hello, we're not available now. Please leave your name and phone number after the beep, and we'll return your call. Mr. Miller, this is Dr. Haskell returning your call. Yes, of course I can forward your prescription to a pharmacy. Just have them call my office and we'll get that sorted out for you. I want to stress you do this soon. Today, if possible. I have you on six milligrams of Risperdal a day, and this isn't something you want go off of cold turkey. We've talked about the chance of your symptoms increasing, but I'm worried about possible side effects, so do me a favor and stay on top of this. In the meantime, just try to avoid stressful situations, but I imagine that shouldn't be a problem in Iceland...
