The country is in a state of revolution. Repeat, a full-scale revolution is in progress. The United States government urges all its nationals to evacuate by whatever means as soon as possible. Events have gone beyond local government control and the United States can no longer guarantee the safety of its citizens. - Look, Brynn, I'll talk to you later. I mean it. - Sarah. - Yes, goodbye. Yeah! (crowd chattering) - [Margaret] Now hurry up, Sarah. - Aren't you ready yet? - [Margaret] Yes, I'm hurrying. - Sarah, I thought I told you to change clothes. - Dad. - Sun Lee, did you find some more suitable clothing for Sarah? - Yes, Master Howard. You come now, Miss Sarah. (crowd chattering) (suspenseful music) - No, no, no, that's not necessary. - Come on, Sarah, we gotta get outta here. - Yeah. Yeah? (crowd shouting) - [Soldier] Get everybody outta here. Everybody over-- - Move it! (crowd and soldiers shouting) - [Soldier] Clean up, men. (crowd and soldiers shouting) - [Woman] Come on! - It's all I have. I'm sorry, Sun Lee. - I'll never forget you, Miss Sarah. I promise. - [Man] Place this over there. (crowd and soldiers chattering) Speed it up, will ya? (suspenseful music) (explosions booming) (explosions booming) - [Allan] Sarah, get down! (guns firing) (soldier grunts) I told you to get down. (glass breaking) - Here, might come in handy. (guns firing) (soldier cries out) (guns firing) (soldier grunts) (guns firing) - Margaret, are you okay? - I'm okay. Sarah. - No matter what happens, get down and stay under the blanket, and for God's sake be quiet. (suspenseful music) Get down, Margaret. - I want him alive. (guns firing) (Allan grunts) - Mama, Mama? Mama? (soft ominous music) (Sarah cries out) (Sanchez grunts) (Sanchez chuckles) (Sarah spits) (Sarah crying out) - No fuckin' manners. Take her, we'll make her talk. (grunts) (Sarah cries out) (Sarah crying) (Sarah whimpers) You sleep there. I said sleep there. (soft ominous music) (Sarah whimpers) - She's all yours. (Sarah crying) - Give her some water. (Sarah gasps) Leave us alone. (Sarah gasps) (Sarah grunting) - That's enough. (Sarah crying) Clean her up. (ominous music) - Get up. (Sarah grunting) (rebel laughing) (soft ominous music) (Sarah gasps) - Didn't you know that fear has a smell? (Sanchez and Sarah grunting) I'm your only hope here. (gentle music) - Hey, (speaking in foreign language)! What are you doing tonight? - [Rick] What are you offering? - Later, later. Now, you eat. You've got to keep your strength up. - Yeah, all this fresh air and hard work, great for the appetite, mm. (Doc clears his throat) Doc, just in time for lunch. - No thanks, maybe a little later, but I would like to talk with you if I could. - Sure. - [Doc] In private. Sorry, An Lee. - Okay. - So? What's the secret? - No secret, Rick, rumors, lots of rumors. - [Rick] About what? - Sanchez. - Thanks for the warning, Doc, but-- - I didn't come here just to warn you, Rick. There's something I've got to ask you. The rumors say that Sanchez is gonna attack the town again, probably tomorrow when the supply trucks are due in. That's how it happened last year, and of course the villagers are very worried. - I don't blame them, but where do I come in? - Well, they think that maybe this time the town has a chance to defend itself. Since you were in the Army, you could train them how to use weapons. Maybe we could fight off Sanchez. - No, Doc. - Every man in town's willing to give it a try. - No! I can't do it. I came here to get away from fighting, I've done my share. I'm not a soldier anymore, I'm a rice farmer, and I'm happy with that, and I'm not gonna change it. - Damn it, then we don't have any chance. We might as well turn the supplies over to him. - There's no time for any training. They'd be slaughtered if they tried to stand up to Sanchez tomorrow. Anyway, you said yourself it's only a rumor. Maybe he won't ever come back. - Well, I told them I'd give it a try. So, you know where to find me when you change your mind. (Rick sighs) (soft twinkling music) - Rick? (somber music) Are you all right? Do you wanna talk about it? - I've never been happier than here with you. I came here to start a new life, but maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe you can never really escape. Doc wants me to train the townspeople to fight Sanchez. I told him no. It goes against everything that I've lived for for the past few years. Maybe I was wrong. Where else are they gonna get help? - I fell in love with a soldier, but he was a man of peace. I'm still in love with that man. Sometimes deciding not to fight can take as much courage as picking up the gun. - I hope you're right. (rebels chattering) - Sarah. You are no longer the ambassador's daughter. You're almost one of us. - You didn't gimme much choice, did ya? - One day you will thank me for it, perhaps even more than that. Let's go, the town is waiting for us. (rebels chattering in foreign language) We attack hard and fast like a wolf pack. Prepare yourselves. She rides with me. - The she-wolf bitch had better stay close to her mate. Anything can happen in battle. (women grunting) (ominous music) - [Sarah] Yes, anything can happen. (Sanchez grunts) (rooster crows) - An Lee! We should wait until I get this thing fixed so that we can go to town together. - You know what it's like. You're not there when the trucks come in, it will take you all day. - Yeah, okay. I'll come in and pick ya up later. - Okay, bye. - Bye. If there's any trouble, you get the hell out as fast as you can, okay? - Don't worry. See you later. (church bell ringing) (suspenseful music) - [Women] Hi! (villagers chattering) - Excuse me. (guns firing) (villagers gasp) (guns firing) What? - Go, he's here! (villagers chattering) (explosions booming) (guns firing) - [Villager] Gotta go! (guns firing) (villagers cry out) (villagers chattering) (guns firing) (An Lee gasps) (guns firing) (men grunt) (guns firing) (men grunting) (guns firing) (men grunting) (guns firing) (man cries out) (villagers chattering) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (villagers grunting) (ominous music) (An Lee screams) - Damn it. (explosions booming) (ominous music) An Lee. (guns firing) (gun fires) (Sarah cries out) (Sarah groans) (guns firing) - Where's the girl? - She ran off. - Find her! (guns firing) Eat this. (explosion booms) (men cry out) (ominous music) - [Rebel] Move it, move it, come on. (villagers chattering) - [Villager] We need (mumbles). Come on. - I see no sign of the girl. (suspenseful music) Sanchez, it's time to move on. - [Villager] Hurry! - [Man] Let's go. - [Rebel] What are you waiting for? (grunts) (villagers chattering) - [Villager] Have you seen my son? - [Woman] I don't know. (woman crying) (villagers chattering) (ominous music) (villagers crying) - They'll pay for this. I promise they'll pay. (villagers crying) - [Child] Look! (villagers crying) - She's one of them! (villagers shouting) - [Villager] Wait, she's one of them. (villagers chattering) - Oh my God. - He's gonna shoot. Get back. - Shoot her! - No! No shoot, no shoot. Miss Sarah, Miss Sarah. It's me, Sun Lee. - How is she? - Well, she's sleeping right now. She lost a hell of a lot of blood. She'll be okay in a few days. - What do you think? - Hard to say. Sun Lee seems to be convinced. - That mark on her, that's Sanchez. - Sounds as if you want her to be one of the bad guys. - Yeah, maybe I do. Where's the justice in her living? - Miss Sarah good girl. - She keeps strange company. - You go! Go, go, go! (Rick sighs) (rebels whooping) (upbeat guitar music) - [Rebel] Yeehaw! (singing in foreign language) (rebels chattering) - Don't be sad, Sanchez. Angelica will make you happy. (rebels clapping rhythmically) ♪ Da da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da ♪ - Sure. (rebels chattering) ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da da da da da ♪ - [Rebel] Take it off! (soldering iron hissing) - Damn it, Rick, you can't really blame them. Almost everyone lost somebody in this. - I thought they wanted my help. - They did, but when they wanted your help, you weren't prepared. - You know about that, Doc, it would've been suicide. - And going after Sanchez on your own isn't? - It seems I don't have a choice. - Maybe ya do. You could take me with you. - The hell I will. - I could help. - I bet you could. The question is who? - I know where Sanchez was heading. - And Sanchez's little whore would lead me straight to him. Sure. - I did what I had to do to survive. I could understand why you wouldn't trust me, but you will never find Sanchez without me. You need me. Besides, you're not the only one with a score to settle. - Looks like you've got yourself a partner. - About a half mile on there's a turnoff. It's the old sports club, he used it sometimes. - What for, murder, torture, rape? - Yeah, he does all that. I wouldn't underestimate him, he's no ordinary criminal. He's smart. - Smart enough to fool you anyway. It's a great headline: Ambassador's Daughter Joins Rebel Gang. Should sell a lotta newspapers. - Look, will you get off my back? Look, I don't care if you like me or not. If you don't get this chip off your shoulder, you're gonna do something dumb and blow any chance we've got. Do I make myself clear? - Clear as a bell. Now lemme tell you a few things. Your story might be the truth, or you could just be using me to get back to Sanchez. I don't know yet, but until I do, you're on a short rope. You put one foot outta line and you're gonna hang yourself on it. Is that clear? - Well, at least we know where we stand. (rifle clicks) - It's clear. (flies buzzing) So how come you never escaped? - You don't know Sanchez. - Try me. - I'm grateful to him for one thing, teaching me how to survive. - He also taught ya to kill. - Yeah, he taught me to kill. He taught me a lotta things. - You really admire him, don't you? - Yeah, maybe I do. - [Rick] And you can justify that-- - I don't have to! I survive for one reason, to avenge the death of my parents. (engines rumbling) - Looks like you're gonna get your chance sooner than you thought. (suspenseful music) - Sanchez scout cars. (guns firing) There's a bridge about two miles down the road. Maybe we can lose 'em in the hills on the other side. - Then let's go. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - [Rebel] Yeehaw! (explosion booms) (rebels laughing) - Woohoo hoo! - [Rebel] Yeehaw ha! (guns firing) (rebels laughing) (gun firing) - [Rebel] It's the girl. - Hurry up with that thing. (rebels laughing) - [Rebel] Where ya goin', honey? (rebels laughing) Get them! (rebels laughing) Hey, come back here, man. (rebels laughing) Hey, come back here. Tryin' to get away, huh? - [Rebel] Yeehaw ha! - Hold on. Oh shit! (Sarah cries out) Come on. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (guns firing) (animals squawking) (gentle music) (Sarah grunts) (gong chimes) (instrument ticking rhythmically) (gong chimes) (gentle music) (monks chanting) - We're wasting our time here. (monks chanting) (gong chimes) I know how we can get Sanchez. - (chuckles) Sure, we'll just call the cops and they can arrest him, right? - My father was processing a secret arms shipment at the time of the coups. - And you just happen to know where it is. - If we could find it, then we could take Sanchez. - If we could find it. - He said something about an Operation Nova. I don't know, it must be hidden somewhere in the city. - Wait a second, did you say Nova? Nova is a freighter, Mar Azul Harbor. Here's the plan. I don't like you going alone. - Someone's got to organize the town. They'll listen to you. - What makes you think those arms are still there? - My father was the only one who knew about that arms shipment. He'd just started to process it when the revolution began. - Every boat in that harbor will be picked clean by now. - They're not gonna take what they don't know is there. This shipment was top secret. It was illegal. It was sent in to prop up a shady government. - And you're sure you'll find it? - I will. I want you to go back to the town and start recruiting. The next time Sanchez attacks, it's gonna be on equal terms. Don't worry. I'll talk the friar into letting me take a few of his novices along for company. - This is a troubled time for our people and our land. In your hearts I can only see vengeance for what you have suffered and I am saddened. - We appreciate your feelings. - Your request is granted. Not for reasons you have stated, but in the hope that ultimately your actions will bring peace. (monks grunting) - [Sarah] I'd like to take them all. - [Friar] You may choose five. (monk grunting) (fighters grunting) (monk hissing) (fighters grunting) - Are you sure about the timing? - I will be there with the weapons, three weeks at the most. - (sighs) Look. Sarah, this ain't gonna be easy. - I will be there. Just make sure there's a truck waiting and the townspeople are ready. Good luck. - Yeah, you, too. (ominous music) - All right. - Sanchez, I saw the girl with the monks down the river. (Sanchez grunts) (ominous music) - Executed. Must be a warning, some kind of keep out sign. (knives thudding) (fighters grunting) - Enough! I said enough. You've broken the law. - What law? - Our law, Corlon's law. Do you know that I can have you all killed (snaps) just like that? But that's not how we do things here. We'll give you a fair trial. (Corlon laughing) - I'm sorry, we could not beat them. - We did the best we could. That's all we can ask. - You are a brave woman. You fight like a man. - I had a tough teacher. You guys aren't exactly pushovers yourselves. - But are we tough enough to defeat Sanchez? - We take it one step at a time. First we've gotta get ourselves outta this mess. What do you think they've got in mind for us? - It's almost night. We'll find out soon. (metal clanging) - You have been found guilty of transgressing my law, Corlon's law, the law of trespass. Do you have anything to say before I pronounce sentence? - We're not interested in you or your docks. - No matter, you've broken the law, Corlon's law. You are sentenced to death, but we're fair. You will engage our executioner in individual combat. Should any of you survive, the others will go free. (cackles) - [Group] Hey diddle diddle! Hey diddle diddle! (group chattering) - [Man] Get back, move. - Get back. - Give way. Give way! Give way! - I got you into this. (ominous music) - (cackles) A fight, a fight. (cackling) (group cheers) (fighters grunting) - No, I will not kill for you! - Kill or be killed, that's the law. - That is your law. Mine is different. - How? - His life for ours, my justice. - [Group] Justice, justice! (Corlon grumbles) - We'll talk. - [Sarah] The ship we're looking for would have been scuttled about a year ago. Look, maybe we could help each other. If we find the arms, we'll only take what we need. The rest is yours. Does that sound fair? - [Corlon] There's nothing on the ship. It's been picked over dozens of times. - Well, nothing but a skeleton. - [Sarah] Here it is. - Nothing, I told you. (knuckles tapping) - This is it. (knuckles tapping) (metal tapping) - They found it. - [Sarah] Right. (Corlon chuckling) Wow. - Ooh, wow. (Corlon laughing) - Woo! All right! - Aldo, this is not gonna work. - Where I go, she goes. Besides, she can handle this. (gun clicks) - All right, let's go. - You know what you're doin'? - Of course I know what I'm doin'. My father was a sailor for Christ's sake. - In the Navy? - Unh-unh, container ships. - How's it goin', Felix? - Huh, ready when you are, I think. - Okay, let's go. Keep close to the coast 'til we reach the river. (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Hey, we're moving. - Huh? How 'bout that! - [Boy] Bye! - Listen, take care. (children cheering) Hey diddle diddle! - [Group] Hey diddle diddle! Hey diddle diddle! Hey diddle diddle! Hey diddle diddle! Hey diddle diddle! (horn blaring) - According to Corlon, the river is mined somewhere right about here. - I see. - If he's right, we should get there by late tomorrow. Is everything ready? - Ready as we'll ever be. (suspenseful music) (monk grunting) - Come on, move it. He may know something. The girl, where is she? We know she was here. - She's gone. - Where? - [Monk] To the city to get weapons. - Weapons, why would she need weapons? - I don't know, I swear. (monk grunts) - But I'm sure our worthy friar does, don't you, Friar? - Yes, Sanchez, I know as well as you. My people have had enough of you and your kind. Thanks to the girl, they will be fighting on even terms next time. - Hm, maybe. If there's a next time. Kill them. (ominous music) (guns clicking) (guns firing) (villagers chattering) - What do ya think, Doc? It's finally taking shape, huh? - Yeah. Any word from Sarah yet? - Nothing. - Then I guess the question is, who arrives first, Sarah or Sanchez? (Rick sighs) - They've been spotted five mile down river. - Get the word to Sanchez. Set up the barricades! (suspenseful music) - Good luck! There, go! (guns firing) Jump! (guns firing) Jump! (explosion booms) Anjin. (guns firing) (man grunts) (guns firing) (man grunts) (guns firing) (men cry out) (guns firing) (men crying out) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - We gotta build this wall up at least knee-high. So why don't you get some guys to help you. Move those plants over-- - How's it goin', Doc? - Hi, Rick. Pretty good, I think. The last of the barricades are going in today. - Still no word? - No, earlier I sent a truck downstream to look for them, but there's been no word yet. - Find me a car, Doc. I'm gonna take a look for myself. - Damn it, Rick, that's crazy. These people can't afford to lose you now. - Without weapons I'm no use to them anyhow. - Your just being here is good enough for most of them. Besides, if what you tell me is true about Sarah, she'll make it. - Listen, Doc, Sanchez will know about those weapons by now. You can bet your life he's gonna come lookin' for them. We can't afford to waste anymore time. - Ah hell, Rick, we know that, but at least give her 'til tomorrow. - I don't wanna talk about it, Doc, my mind's made up. (horn blaring) (villagers chattering) - Who is that? - Who's this? (horn blaring) - Who's that? - [Villager] Please open the gate. (horn blaring) (suspenseful music) - Sarah. (villagers chattering) - Come on, let's go. - Who could it be? - So what took ya so long? - The girl, Sanchez. Let me have the girl. I'll make her suffer, slowly. Painfully. Just give her to me. Tomorrow, Sanchez? - Tomorrow. (rooster crows) (villagers chattering) (church bell rings) (engines rumbling) - This town is nothing but peasants and farmers! I want the girl and I want her alive! (birds chirping) - Hold your fire until I say! (engines rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Here they come! - Now! - Fire! (guns firing) (explosions booming) (men cry out) (guns firing) - Move back, move back! (guns firing) - Turn around. - Back! - Go back! - Turn around! - Go back! (guns firing) - Hold your fire! - Cease fire! Cease fire! - Hey! (villagers cheering) - Think they'll be back? - They'll be back. - How can you be so sure? - I lived with them, remember. - Yeah, how could I forget? Is it you or the town that he wants? - Tell ya what, he'll be back tomorrow, why don't ya ask him. - We did it! (villagers cheering) - Both of these approaches have been mined. - There's no other way in. - The girl has prepared it well. - The girl, just a girl. Sarah, I taught her well. There has to be a way. - The girl, the girl, he's totally obsessed with her. Why won't he listen to reason? - Sanchez never listens to reason. - This is madness. They're better armed and this time they're prepared. It's suicide! - Be calm, Reuben. Sanchez has never failed us before. - I don't like it. (soft romantic music) - It is your decision. - Why are you leaving us, Reuben? - It's not the town or the weapons, is it, Sanchez? It's the girl. - The girl will return. Her place is here. - To attack the town is madness. I say we should wait. Well, Sanchez, what do you say? - I say goodbye. (gun fires) (Reuben groans) (ominous music) Are the smoke missiles ready? - Ready. - Okay, let's move! (rebel spits) - Have them the sound the bell. I want everyone ready now. - They're ready. - Good. - Look, Sarah, about Sanchez. (villagers chattering) - Save it. Aldo! The moment you see anything, I wanna know. - Okay, let's go. (villagers chattering) (dog barking) (villagers chattering) - [Man] We're out of bullets here, aren't we? - [Villager] Oh here, this should do it. - Additional bullets? - Sure. - You ready? - Yeah. - [Villager] They're in the back. - Sure they're gone. - They're here! - They're here, they're here. (bell ringing) - They are approaching. (villagers chattering) (bell ringing) - [Villager] Think I see something. (bell ringing) (engines rumbling) - [Sarah] What the hell are they up to? - [Rick] They're tryin' to smoke us out. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (man grunts) (guns firing) - Get the truck outta the way! (guns firing) (rebels chattering) - Fire! (guns firing) (man grunts) (guns firing) (rebel cries out) (monk groans) (guns firing) (men grunting) - What's this rebel doin' here? - Everybody gets taken care of here. - You're damn right. - Knock it off, Johan. Think what you're doing. (guns firing) - [Man] Nurse! (guns firing) (explosion booms) (man cries out) (man groans) (guns firing) (couple grunts) - Aldo! Aldo. Are you all right, Aldo? (guns firing) (grenade clinks) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (explosion booms) (man cries out) (guns firing) (man cries out) (guns firing) (explosion booms) (man cries out) (guns firing) (gun fires) (men grunting) (gun fires) (rebel grunts) - Thanks. (guns firing) (men grunting) (explosion booms) (man cries out) (explosion booms) (guns firing) (men grunting) (gun firing) (man grunts) (guns firing) (rebel grunting) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (Sarah gasps) (gun fires) (Angelica grunts) (guns firing) (gun fires) (gun fires) (guns firing) (machine rumbles) (Rick grunting) (Rick and Sanchez grunting) (ominous music) - Sanchez! (Rick grunts) - You won't kill me. - You better believe it. - Then why don't you? Go ahead, shoot. (suspenseful music) Look me in the eye, Sarah. Can you? Can you do it? You need me. You understand me. We're really the same, you and I. You just don't want to admit it. - It's true, Sanchez. You taught me well. - Well? (gun fires) (Sanchez grunts) - Rick?
