Dorothee! Hanna! Charlotte? Mathilda! - Don't move. - It's just a scratch. It will not kill me. Can kill if you don't save it. I'll give you a Look. Do it. It's good now. Now you look very hard. - Of where the scar came from? - It's a long story. We want to hear it. People are not comfortable with me. I was in the house of the beast. Sometimes there are owners.

You don't bring me anymore! This is it! You don't get anything! Get out of here! Thieves are only interested in the valuable board. Jewelry and other are just a fad. What can we conclude from that? In these houses, the thief has already come. Where they hit next? Before the farm the Mock, they call something. They talk about a Santa Claus that flew low. So what-Maybe Santa lives near here.
