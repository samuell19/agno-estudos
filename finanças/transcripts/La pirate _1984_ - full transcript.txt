THE PIRATE A long time ago, the Pygmies lived in the wonderful reign of Khum. And they were happy there, the sun shining all day, and the forests and rivers offering plenty of food. May I have a cigarette? Thank you. One day the giant Dzom arrived in their land. - Someone's pushed him. - Someone's pushed me! It was you, your ratbag. You pushed me. She tricked me up! She tricked me up! No, no, I'm fine. Really. I'm not drunk. It was her, she pus... Take off the light. Move along. On the mouth. - On the mouth. - You've been wanting this, right? It's really bad what she says. She says we'd do everything in order to reach the light. She closed the door. You'll stay outside. - And you'll die in darkness. - That's enough. Shit. Who are you? Alma! What's going on downstairs? What you're doing? - What's going on downstairs? - Nothing. As if it could be anyone. Don't go, stay. Hey, stay. It can't be you. It can't be you. Why did you come back? I've been waiting for you for so many nights. If you hadn't tried to trip me I'd still avoided you. The tripping was not for you. - It was for me. - I know, I know. Don't be afraid, I got the keys. I got them here. Help me. Help me. Help me. Go. I can't go upstairs. No more hotels. I must be the only one in one's heart. I did all this, all this, and then I don't have the guts anymore. Despite that, do you still love me? I love you, I love you. You will ask for another room for you, they will give you the key. Mine is 204. You are so sure of yourself. No. Sorry. Sorry. Good Evening. A woman will come right after me. Give her a room on the same floor. 224? Yes. And could you bring me wine? Yes, m'am. Good Evening. May I have one Coke? Yes. Michael! - Did you see her? - Yes. - And? You like her? She's not bad. I just arrived. I will wait in the lobby. Everything is fine. Pierre Loti, Navy Lieutenant. What he went looking for... Pierre Loto, Lieutenant. Miss, it's a pleasure to know you. I did not ask you. I was carrying an investigation, and well in it I fell in love with you. You know me? Carole, that is one. Alma, two. Her husband, three. You, your little devil, four. And you are number five. That's your only name. Wonderful. I've always wanted to have a number. - Also I'm not an even number. - You weren't invited, number five. You won't even notice me. I will be discreet, just as a mouse. You made it. I just had to wait for a little too much. I'm here. It's not enough? Come closer. I always loved you, you had nothing to fear. Closer. Not be able to hold you in my arms. to have your body against mine. The pleasure of all those terrible things is unknown to you. Let's play a game. I can't play with Alma, you know, because of my friendship with her husband. I can play with Carole, discreetly, without her knowing it. You play with Alma. And it will stay between us. We'll see soon. You can start offering champagne to me and Michael. Pay attention, I'm humbly talking to you. Humbly. Always take the hat off. Is everything OK with this guy? - Yes. I will take this wine upstairs. - Wait a minute! Take these keys with the wine. Right now, and without making faces. I did not come to kiss you. I came to knock your teeth out. The room where I loved you was more beautiful than this one here. Yes, but I'm here. I waited for you, you called me and now I'm here. Because you wanted me to. And even if I kissed a man, I've always loved you. And now, you like the room now? And I? You think you don't hurt me also? I was waiting for you. I went to the airport, and waited for you. Every day. Every flight. I waited for you. You or someone else sent by you to kill me. And if I needed to get down to get a pen on the ground, a pen to write you letters with, that I would never send you, I would keep an eye on my back, afraid of being attacked. But there was no killer. Just a girl who seemed to know all my thoughts. Is that her? It was her who leaded me back to you. Yes, that's it. You are hiding... The wine. Who sent this? A man downstairs, with a little girl. Put that down there. Here, your keys. You can go home. You disgust me! You just think about yourself. Fuck! - What you are doing? - I call him. - No. - Didn't you want that? - No! I will call him. That's what you want, right? We'll make him cry. We'll make him cry. It's easy. Just laugh while I'm on the phone. OK? No, no. No. Hello? Hello? No. Forgive me, please. That was a mistake. Forgive me! Don't leave me, don't leave me. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it. I just can't. You OK? No, I'm not. Whose are these feet? Whom did you steal them from? You think they don't fit with the rest? No, they don't. Empty your pockets. I was sure about Alma's photo. Confiscated. I'm taking Alma, not you. How would you kiss me if it was the first time? Kiss me like the first time. If you were a man, would you like Carole? If I was a man, I'd do like her, and fall in love with Alma. You should take a shower. Me? If someone is really dirty, dirty in its soul, he has to wash it. But me, I'm... I've nothing against water. Cold, even warm, water can be nice. Women scare kids, torment and humiliate them with it. And while they're still only babies. Oh, now I see you. Aren't you a former champion? But in fact you're a mess. You didn't get it. While you are bathing, I'll help you and check your pockets again. I showed you everything. You always hide something. You're never really honest. Great! She doesn't trust me! And I shouldn't trust you either. Amazing! Where did Carole find you? Are there more trolls like you? I found her. Don't make a scene now. Ah okay. I was afraid that you would forget me. I was so afraid of never seeing you again, never feeling you again, not having you on my arms, not having your body against mine anymore. Tell me no one has ever embraced you like this. Tell me I'm the only one you want. Yes. And if I make you cry, tell me nobody is as mean as I am with you. That nobody makes you laugh like I do. So is this about minor corruption or adultery? You did this for love? What? Explain! You think I'm Alma's lover? Her husband, my friend, thinks I'm his wife's lover? What an honor! I could be her lover. Do what you have to do, adultery can't stay unpunished. Ring. Hey! Tell her to go! And you stay here! - I didn't disturb anyone. - That's good. Hey dear, you have to come and release me, the husband is angry, and they locked me in. Those bastards. It wasn't locked. Isn't that normal here? Apologies. The husband seems to like me. I must tell him that Alma's here. And then he'll... We have to protect her, and fast, otherwise it's over. Would you come with us to Boulogne? Didn't you mean Calais? Could be Dunkerque. Yes, it could be. And my shoes? Lost or confiscated. I don't remember. Those are my seven-league boots. Hope they were confiscated. Out. Don't be afraid. It's OK. I came give you these shoes, they were wandering around. We are leaving. We can't stay here. I have a friend who places ads on specialized magazines. He said we can punish him, if he doesn't obey. Okay then. He said that we have to be clean and work hard. We can use him for one hour. - Like a taxi? - But without paying. It's all shit. Don't do it again! And this isn't about your intimacy. Not your business at all! Get out! The other one is coming back. Is there another one, right? You betrayed her, didn't you? She didn't even... I need shoes. Gonna use the line downstairs to send telegrams to all hotels in Dunkerque. - You're not moving. Stay here. - That means telegrams are welcome. - So that they'll know that... - I'm waiting Alma to call. Yes, but I need shoes. Not that two sons of a bitch you sent us. This I don't need. It was going well. Why we don't talk to each other anymore? Everything went as I wanted. And now, I don't know what to do. I want you to think that I'm a good person. Come here with me. You can call him from the next gas station. I never said I would leave you! Don't count on that. We did it right. Yes. It's OK if he calls. Let's not get scared of a call. Andrew, stop it. Stop it. Don't say that, Andrew! Of course I love you. If I didn't love you it would be so much easier. You can't help me. I choose the hotel. It would be good if we could go with the car in the room. Not having to leave the car. But now you are a free woman... That's silly. You could say I'm getting better. Don't be corny. What about this telegram? You are not curious? I will let it intrigue me. I don't like to anticipate surprises. May I close the door? - Yes. You are too big for me. You hurt me. I wanted to kiss your face the first I saw you. And he seduced you, just like he did with everyone who came to see me, with his eccentricities, the toy trains, and his determination to not please people. I managed to tell you: "I want to show you my secret room." Fuck Alma! "I don't want to see your room." And I thought: "She doesn't see me. And yet she came here to see me." And then I added, while staring at you: She's beautiful. And you said: "Yes." I stayed, trapped in the room, mad at him, because he didn't let me see you. And I kissed you to punish you and him. I see your hands, and I hate you for having taken me, even if it was all that I wanted. I wanted you, like you were a tiny little thing. and you scared me, just like with the big ones. You got old. Soon you're just like her. I love you, I don't love you, I love you. I love you, I don't love you. Poor girl, you make me cry. I will find you, just like an animal. I will never leave you. Love. I knew it was you, crazy number 5. Now... Now help me... Help me to torn us apart. No. - Go. - No. Go now. Go. I know you could follow me. I had the best you could offer me. The most beautiful. Hang on, hang on. Stay with me, despite of myself. I beg you. You would never forgive me if I asked you to leave him. Look at me. - No. Look at me. I'm not that generous. You would blame me every day, and you wouldn't be happy. You look like everything was fine. I love you, as a friend. And I love you as the lover I've never had. I want to live like I was dead, like you had killed me. I could be happy like this. Get your clothes. Put your clothes on! Do as I say and go get your clothes. And as an enemy and an ally, I love you. - Will you never come back? - No. Never. I will call you, and you will never answer. I will rent this room permanently so I can come and cry for my lost brother. Wish you both all the best. Thank you. If you knew, you would let me go. You have no idea of how beautiful they were, Carole and him. The first time they met I hadn't understood why they took so long to do something. It was so evident they were meant for each other. I was so afraid. We have to go back. You are horrible, crazy and mean. And I love you like this. You don't love me. You are just jealous. Where's your jealousy? Show me, otherwise I won't believe you. You don't love anyone. I just want to know who you love the most. You know, I have have never been jealous of you. Never. You are both useless. They will come! I called them. Called them. Called them. You can't leave her alone. We have to go back. Go back...faster. Faster! Come. I want to be with you, but I don't want you to protect me. You have to forgive him, for all that is about to happen. You have to understand him. Forgive him now. Forgive. Forgive. Yes. And now you cry like a woman for what you didn't protect as a man. Attention both of you. Need permission to pass. Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! There's nothing to do. It's not her fault, if you knew her... She belongs to me. What she eats, what she drinks, and what she dreams about. No. I payed for her, in cash. Your soul and your ass both belong to me. No, no, you promised me. No, no! No! She's mine. I payed In cash for her. She goes. She leaves! Out! There it is, caught in the spider's web. If you think it will end, if he carries on with it, he'll deal with a brave woman, in a natural, and abominable way. Well, she doesn't seem to want to go, I might as well stay. I might as well look. I might as well watch. That could turn me on. Have ourselves a little party. We can send up some drinks if you want. Come on, relax! Enjoy it! No need to be embarrassed. Come on, I want you to show me. Get on with it. Go on, show me. I want it to be utterly and absolutely disgusting. Go! Kiss her on the mouth. - On the mouth, kiss her. Go on! - No! Go on, kiss her. Down the throat. You disgust me. Repel me. More! Do it again! Again! Alma, stop it. I think I would like it better if you took off her ring. I know I should like it, it's more exciting if you have it on, but... But for some reason, I don't know why, I'd rather you took it off. Take it off. How long will you carry with this? But I thought you'd like like this. I thought this was what you wanted. I'm sorry, my fault. I was wrong. So, what is it? L’Amour impossible? (The impossible love) Where does that lead us? Exit husband. Exit husband. Is that it? End of husband. End of mariage. End of ring. Give me back my ring. I want my ring. Give me back my ring. Give me back my ring! It's none of your business! I want my ring back. You are a bitch! I love her! I love her! I love her! I don't want this ring! I don't want this ring! Leave me. Don't touch me. I don't... I don't want that ring back. Don't touch me! I couldn't touch you, even if I wanted I couldn't touch you. I hate both of you. You know, for some guys, it's hard to have feelings. They pretend to be strong, but that's all made up. Come on. - Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Come on. Come on. Yes. Jesus. She hasn't chose yet. Not really. She has to choose between us. It's not finished yet. You are afraid of staying alone with her. Who you think you are? You think you are better than me? Look at yourself in the mirror. I could have brought you here, led by the hand. You are not better of than I am. Can't you go and see what they are doing? Go see what they are doing. I want to drink. You'd like to know, who'll put her in bed when she's drunk? Hey you, ask you friend to send up some drinks. Alma is thirst and I can do with one. Well, at least it's warm, comfortable, it's not too badly off. Of course, if you wanted to leave you could have done so just then. You could have gone down for drinks. I wouldn't have stopped you. Or would I? They call me for such a triviality. But I will not fall into the temptation, of being surprising. Wait. Listen to me, you don't touch anything. It's hot. What she is doing? I want her to stop staring at me. I don't want her to look at me with those eyes. Those dead eyes, they scare me, I can't see inside of them. Stop it. We shouldn’t look at people with those eyes. I want her to look at me with judgmental eyes, like everyone else does. Let's go. You can't drink in front of her? Why are you so mean with me? Well, here's your glass. I'm there, call me if you want me. I decided to invite everyone, to have something to eat. You, of course, will be staying with me. Until Alma says you can go. Don't worry, I got it. Whenever you need me I will be there. I'm like a candle, I stay with you until you fall asleep. Why we we are not supposed to love? You come here you fucking bitch. Don't you understand? I've lost! And if I invite you for a fucking meal, I don't accept no as an answer. Wait for me downstairs. Do you wanna join us for some dinner? Let her obliterate me, slowly, just her. She will love you for that. You understand me? Me? I got everything. Did you understand her? Don't forget my coffee, and my floating island. Won't you eat your food? Didn't you learn to eat as a kid? They never taught you? Now you have to eat everything. Courage, balls, a little less of dignity. You see. Someone has to take care of her. She wants to be punished. Come on, do it! You're all stupid. You understand now why I carry this half-witted around with me? - Okay. - I need to get enlightened. You want to eat something? No. Alma is gone. You're lying! I've been watching the exit. - Where? - What the fuck d'you think I've been sitting here for? Where'd she go? Go! Fetch her. Fetch her back! - Great. Get her back! - Couldn't be worse. - I'm heading to the station. See. Easy. You catch'em you can keep'em. Too bad. I don't like what you women keep hidden under that. You know where is she? Stakes are rising. Passion's high, but concurrence is worse. What do you know about passion? Go deliver your report. Anyway, you've no idea, all that is beyond your understanding. There're no fingerprints. Just treat me like a dog, I'm used to it. But I'm really cautious. I promised her that you would help me. Do you like this? Let's enjoy it then. Pretend all is well. That's good. I will need you. Don't go anywhere. I will be right back. We are leaving. Go. Don't argue. We are leaving. Just follow me. We don't leave anyone behind. Anyone who doesn't want to stay? Get out now or never! The bar is that way. Congratulations. You've thought just about everything, haven't you? Neither of them knew where you were. You see? We are pushing to the limit. I'd rather come alone. And you would find yourself in Douvres, or god knows where. Warm up your cold ocean. Well, what do we do then? Who should I send to you? You are cute, but you will be beautiful. Cabin R. - Have you seen her? - Cabin R. A double. And well, is she still coming with us? We will manage to get rid of those men. Come. - No. Why? Why you let him do it? He doesn't waste any time. I've already said goodbye. Hold on, slower. One at a time. Cabin R? What do you mean? It's occupied. Busy reuniting. Trying to not get lost again. He, she, I don' t know. I came. I'm here. Is what you wanted, isn't it? Only now you've got to stop. I can't go any longer. I can't believe. I can't believe that you will let me end like this. Why did you give me this filthy boat as a present? Please, stroke my hair. If I could cut you out and throw you out. - Where's she? - Ahead, outside, no idea. Beautiful like a figure head, but you... I have not said anything. and I have not done anything. I left him sink himself. Am I so horrible? I wanted to find you sleeping. And see you again along a road, where I would be waiting for you. Or in a bar nearly a station. You would have returned, and I would think: "Yes, that's crazy". And I'd know again what is like to be enchanted. But you don't sleep. I won't leave him. Why have you brought him here then? And with me. Why? Why? I don't know. I don't know. I have never lied to you. I always defended you two. Always. There's no honor in being guilty, dirty and unfortunate. It's about getting free. What if I don't want to be free? Why do you want me to be with you two? He or you, both would do nothing but hurt me. You can't do anything for me! Nothing! Nothing but get bored! Boredom! Come, this doesn't look good. That's crazy. I used to pray, I loved it. When I was a kid I prayed to find my cat, and I found him. And I prayed for frivolities, yes, I prayed to have regular periods. But today, today I want to pray to be condemned, And I don't seek any salvation for my soul. England, England. And if they think England will be either winner or loser... Looking for a rime? A crime? Piss off... Come on, fuck off. I wanted to say sorry. You don't need to say sorry. He doesn't listen to you anyway. Give that to her. But you can't abandon her. Just leave me alone. But you cannot abandon her. - Shut up! Leave me. What do you want? Cry with them? Like a star? Oh, I'm star, but it's bad, the show is bad, it's very bad. Hold on, what you got here? A letter? You've got a letter? For Alma? Aren't you ashamed? Shall I tell you what it says, I'll never come back, you've made your decision. Your dear husband. What do you think? Shame on you. Carrying such a fucking letter. Everybody is angry with me. I used to make them laugh, because I'm stupid, and I amused them. It's never enough... It's never enough... They always want more. And I can't move, just like a trapped butterfly. And they think I make them go away. Everybody gets what wanted from me. If they knew that I want to die... I have found a beauty that loves me, and it wants me dead. And if you don't kill me you are a murderer. I've always knew you needed a murderer. I found my passion. And I tried to keep going, like I would never reach the end. But I'm so tired, I've been tired for a long time. I want her to kiss me. Go. She likes love as if it was honey. Did you screw her? Leave me alone, you're crazy! Get down! You are a piece of shit. On the ground! Oh, so you had a gun, just like that. And Carole hasn't told me anything. Give me that. You didn't answer my question. No, we didn't sleep together. That's not nice, the gun, the gun is not nice. I don't even want to look at it. Leave me alone! There was a time when we didn't use guns. We used knives. Only knives. After five stabs, eight stabs... Knives. Do you want a knife? Yes. Yes, I want a knife. Knives everywhere, I want them to be everywhere. No guns. And you, the infantile, you never sleep? I'm always alert, didn't you notice? - Where's the husband? - I don't know. I don't care. He is alone. So you brought me guns? Where are your guns? Let me go. Let me go! Oh yes, you are a superstar... You are not dangerous. And you are an asshole. An asshole! Someone offers you a knife. Everyone thinks about it. Don't cut yourself. Don't touch me! And you stay in your little world. Cold and miserable. You believed I wanted to die, and he would be the one to murder me. You are capable of nothing. I was waiting for you. You are capable of nothing. Let her go, she's mine. - Come with me. - No! Yes, yes. No! Yes. No! Yes! Yes! Alma! Don't move or I will shoot. Don't move! No! Don't move or I will kill you. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Subtitles: mortauxvaches
