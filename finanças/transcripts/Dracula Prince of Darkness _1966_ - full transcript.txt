(Narrator) After a reign of hideous terror spanning more than a century, the King of the Undead was finally traced to his lair, high in the Carpathian Mountains. Through the decades many have sought to destroy him. All had failed. Here at last was an adversary armed with sufficient knowledge of the ways of the vampire to bring about the final and absolute destruction. This, then, was his fate. Thousands had been enslaved by the obscene cult of vampirism. Now the fountainhead himself perished. Only the memory remained. The memory of the most evil and terrible creature who ever set his seal on civilisation. (Sobbing) There, there, Frau Koenig. Calm yourself. Stay with me. Frau Koenig, you know that this is for the best. The risk is too great to allow for any other way. You do understand? You must understand. Frau Koenig, tell me that you agree. (Man) Hurry up, Father. It'll be dark soon. Please, Frau Koenig. So be it. Then it must be done without your consent. No, you won't do it. You can't! She's my daughter, my baby. You mustn't. You can't. (Gunshot) Barbarians! This is none of your concern. Would I ride 50 kilometres in this filthy weather if it were none of my concern? You shame the cloth you wear. We can't take any chances! Chances? What chances? This child died. Do you understand that, man of God? - She died, nothing more. - You... you can't be sure. Of course I'm sure! Take her to the churchyard. She will be buried properly. I will read no service over her. I will bury her. Now do as I say. Do as I say! You're out of your jurisdiction. I'll complain to the Bishop. Do, and tell him that I stopped you from performing an act of blasphemy. Or would you prefer that I told him? Well, we have to be sure. You are an idiot, Father. Worse than that, you are a superstitious, frightened idiot. We... Take care I don't have cause to ride this way again. (Laughter, indistinct chatter) That's right, take it steady now. Don't stop for a breather, though. I say, that's good. It's no good. That's as much as I can manage. Very good try, sir. Here, drinks all round again. Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. He's just bought drinks for everyone. I know. Charles is far too extravagant. A few shillings. We can afford it. But that's not the point. You've got your disapproving expression on again, Helen. What is it this time? Well, I... I know it's none of my business, but that was the third time you supplied everybody with drinks. I know. They don't appreciate it, you know, they... They just think you're a fool. Helen, what I do I do for my own satisfaction, nobody else's. Well, what about you, Alan? Do you disapprove of your younger brother's misplaced generosity? I long ago gave up approving or disapproving of what you do. (Chuckles) That's a sensible fellow. You see, Helen? Alan knows that I'm incorrigible. He accepts the fact. Now, why don't you? Foolishness is foolishness. And now, as we have to all get up very early tomorrow morning, I suggest we go to bed. I think that's a very good idea. - What can I fetch you, Father? - Oh, mull me some claret. It's not fit for a beast out there tonight. Well, what are you all looking at? Garlic to keep out the bogeyman. There is no bogeyman any more. And if there was, this wouldn't keep him out. Can't you get it into your thick skulls it's over? Finished these past ten years. Ladies, may I warm myself by your fire? Of course. Charles, let the father sit by the fire. I'd prefer to stand, thank you. Oh, it's easier to warm oneself this way. Ah, that's better. Fortunately, my calling still allows me the luxury of a warm posterior. One of the few pleasures left in life. You strike me as a man who takes his pleasure seriously, Father. I do, my son. Indeed I do. Pleasure in this life is important. Well, what are the alternatives? Hellfire and brimstone, or... No, I'm sure that warming one's backside in front of an open fire and mulled claret aren't part of the grand design. No, these are earthly pleasures to be enjoyed while one is able. And what, may I ask, are four charming English people doing in the Carpathians? Oh, may I introduce us, Father? My name is Charles Kent. This is my wife, Diana, my brother, Alan, and his wife, Helen. Father Shandor, Abbot of Kleinberg at your service. Oh, please be seated. Father. Kleinberg must be a dangerous journey for you to travel armed like this. (Laughs) Another of my earthly vices. Each time I leave the monastery, I bring this with me. The brethren think it is a bundle of prayer books for the unfortunate heathen I meet on my travels. I'm sure they truly believe that the venison I bring home from time to time drops dead by the divine will of God. (Charles laughs) (Shandor) You too are hunting? No, no, some climbing, some sightseeing. Travel broadens the mind. Admirable, but I question your choice of locale. You certainly won't have your mind broadened by this lot. You don't seem to have a very high opinion of your flock. Not mine. Oh, dear me, no. I wouldn't tolerate them. I wouldn't tolerate them! You'll find things very different at Kleinberg. I hope that you will visit us there. You could stay at the monastery. The brothers would make you very welcome. Well, thank you, Father. That sounds like a fine idea. Our programme won't allow for it. Tomorrow we go to Carlsbad. Though I suppose we could change our plans. I suggest that you do so. It's very kind of you to invite us, but... as my wife points out, we do have our programme to stick to. I don't care whether you visit Kleinberg or not. I'm just saying you shouldn't go to Carlsbad. I've heard it's very beautiful. (Shandor) So is Atropa belladonna. Deadly nightshade. We're all quite experienced climbers, Father. Climbing has got nothing to do with it. You may think me an eccentric old cleric and not much credit to my cloth. Perhaps I am. I enjoy shocking people's susceptibilities. But I can be serious, and when I tell you not to go to Carlsbad, I want you to take note. - Landlord? - Yes, Father. Have my horse brought round. Well, I'm delighted to have met you all. And if you do decide to disregard my advice, at least stay well clear of the castle. Castle? But there's no castle marked on the map. I would have noticed. Because it is not on the map doesn't mean it does not exist. Stay away from it. Ladies. That's very strange. Stop fussing, dear. The father made a mistake. If there was a castle, it would be marked. Well, right or wrong, we'll find out tomorrow. I don't care how much money you give me. I ain't gonna go no further. Don't be ridiculous. You contracted to drive us to Carlsbad. You can walk. It's bare two kilometres. Walk? You must be mad. You're the ones that are mad. Oh, come on, man. It'll be dark soon. Aye, it will. That's why I'll go no further. It's not our fault that you slipped a wheel and we're four hours late. I'm not saying that it is. I'm just saying that I ain't going to go no further. Look! Up there! The castle. - What's that place? - What place? - The castle. - I don't see no castle. That's because you're not looking, idiot. All right. Now, we've had enough argument. Get the women out. Now! Get them out! You'd better do as he says. Leave it, Charles. Leave it. He's a highway robber. He just wants our luggage. I'll be back here two hours after dawn tomorrow. If any of you are here then, I'll take you on to Carlsbad. (Shouts, cracks whip) Ah, well, he wasn't a robber. I suppose we ought to be grateful for small mercies. Why did he say he'd be back after dawn tomorrow? He's frightened of the dark. - You don't mean that. - No, of course not. He should be reported to the authorities. We're not in England now, Helen. Anyway, I doubt if there are any authorities to report him to. And it wouldn't help us very much even if there were, would it? Why wouldn't he look at that place? Well, Shandor was right in any event. Yes, but why does everyone else deny the existence of the place, even the map? - Maybe we could stay there. - He warned us to stay away from there. I agree with him. Well... There's the alternative. I'd prefer that. So would I. Very well, let's take a look. (Horses whinnying) There's no driver! - Well, can we stop it? - We can try. - Charles, be careful. - Watch it, Charles. Well, you're the most welcome horses I've ever seen, both of you. It's a bit strange, isn't it? Haven't you heard? Never look a gift horse in the mouth, especially when there are two with a coach. Alan's right. The whole thing's strange. I agree. Well, all I can see is, we won't have to spend the night in that hut. All aboard. - All right. - That's more like it. Let's see to the luggage. Helen, hold the horses, will you? Diana, you hold them. All right, darling. - Carlsbad? - Carlsbad. Get up! (Charles) Whoa! Whoa! Come round, come round! Whoa! We're taking the wrong road. Come back! Whoa, whoa! Come back! - What's wrong? - They're going the wrong way. I can't turn them. Come back! Whoa! Come back! Whoa, whoa, come back! All right, my beauties, you're calling the tune. It's true, he really can't control them. Well... Let's see if your master is as hospitable as you are. What do you think? I don't think they're horses at all. I think they're St Bernards in disguise, rescuing travellers who are stranded by the crossroads. We made enough noise arriving. You'd think somebody would have come out, if not to welcome us, to, er... chase us away. Yes. Well, it's no good standing here debating the situation. Let's pay our respects. Ladies. No, Charles. Surely it can't be as bad as spending the night in that hut. - It's eerie. - Oh! Well, let's find out just how eerie. It's open. Well? Hello? Anybody there? You're right, Helen. It is a bit eerie. I don't think we should go in. We've got to now. Come on! (Door closes) Hey... stop! - What now? - I don't know. Well, if you'd listened to me back there at the crossroads, we wouldn't be in this state now. Oh, if we'd listened to you, Helen, we'd still be in England. Would that be bad? You wanted to broaden your mind. I suppose you call this educational travel. I'm sure it would be very educational if we knew what it was all about. Stop it, both of you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Helen. Look at this! What is it, darling? The table is set for four persons. Don't you see? First the coach brings us to the castle, and now the dinner table. - We're expected. - That's ridiculous. How could that be? I don't know, but we are. No, Alan's right, darling. Any moment now, four perfectly normal, respectable people are going to come down those stairs for dinner. Well, if there's anybody up there, they must be stone-deaf. There's one way to find out. No! No, we can't stay here. - We must leave this place now. - Helen! - Steady, darling. It's all right. - It isn't! It isn't! Come, sit down a moment. Charles. Charles, you... you mustn't go upstairs. You mustn't. He's only going to see if there is anyone at home. I'll be back before you know it. Charles! It'll be all right, Helen, you'll see. Hello? (Charles) Alan! Come up here a minute, will you? - This is someone's bedroom. - Come here. Whose cases are these? They're yours, aren't they? - Where are you going? - To look next door. (Charles) Alan! Our things are in there. (Footsteps) I'm sorry if I startled the ladies, sir. It was unintentional. Why didn't you make your presence known sooner? I was unpacking your cases. I trust the rooms are satisfactory. Yes, admirable. But I don't understand. None of us do. My Master's hospitality is renowned. But... If you are ready, I will serve dinner now. Thank you, sir. - Well, I still don't understand it. - Please, let's leave here. Oh, dinner sounds like a splendid idea. I agree. - Diana, you can't... - Well, why not? Ten minutes ago we were stranded in the cold, miles away from anywhere. Now we're warm. We're going to be fed. And if that man's master is anything like I think he's going to be, we're going to be entertained as well. Yes, Diana's right. Come on, let's sit down. What's your name? Klove, sir. Well, er... Klove, isn't your master joining us for dinner? No, sir, I'm afraid not. Is he indisposed? He's dead. I'm sorry if we appear a little dense. Perhaps you could explain. Explain, sir? Yes, you seem to have expected us. (Charles) Er... this dinner, our rooms, the carriage, everything. Certainly, sir. My master is dead, but instructions were left that the castle should always be ready to receive guests. I am merely carrying out his wishes. I see. Who was your master? His name was Count Dracula, an old and distinguished family. That is the coat of arms over the fireplace. Does no one hold the title now? My master died without issue, sir, in the accepted sense of the term. Now, if you will excuse me... Mm, the soup's delicious! - Well, er... - Mm. What a marvellous man he must have been to have stated in his will that the castle should always be ready for travellers. - Perhaps we'll get a bill tomorrow. - Oh, no, surely not. No, no, I didn't mean it. No, if only that coachman knew it. He did us a favour when he deserted us. He was frightened. We all were at first. The unexplained's always a little frightening. Even you must admit, this is preferable to spending the night in a woodcutter's hut. I'm still frightened. I don't know why. I'm just frightened. I admit it was a little strange at first, dear, but now it's all been explained. Father Shandor tried to warn us about this place. (Chuckles) Oh, Helen. He tried to warn us. That's because he wanted us to go and visit him in Kleinberg. It's my belief that we're all extremely lucky. Now, I think we should take advantage of the late Count's hospitality and enjoy ourselves. Here's to him. May he rest in peace. Count Dracula. Count Dracula. Guess who? Horace Peabody. Right first time. Did you enjoy your port, cigars and man's talk? No, not very much, but then you know it takes female company for me to shine. Who's Horace Peabody? - Oh, an old beau of mine. - Oh. Before your time, darling. There was no before my time. You were a schoolgirl in pigtails. Even schoolgirls have their moments. Hurry up, I'm cold. Is the bed comfortable? Not really. It's lumpy. Maybe you've got Horace Peabody in there somewhere. - He was far too much of a gentleman. - Oh. Oh, it is lumpy. Oh, fine, that'll give Helen something else to complain about. It's funny about Helen this evening. Oh, darling, she's always the same. Two miles outside London and nothing is ever right. No, this evening was different. She wasn't complaining. She really was frightened. - She hardly touched her dinner. - It was a damn fine dinner, too. But didn't you notice the way she kept looking over her shoulder all the time? Klove frightened the life out of her. Yes, well, he's not a particularly comforting person to have around, I'll grant you that. I'm glad you noticed it. I thought it was just Helen and I. What is it about him? Well, I don't know, really. He's a bit like the castle, sort of dusty. He's not particularly clean either. Do you suppose he cooked the dinner? I haven't the faintest idea, darling. Well, the place isn't exactly swarming with servants, is it? (Knocking) Yes, Klove? Is there anything further you or Madam require, sir? Er... no, thank you. Then I wish you good night. He is a strange one. Strange and frightening. I wouldn't go so far as to say that. I can't get through to you, can I, to any of you that it is frightening! Everything about this place is evil. You're tired, dear. We've all had a most trying day. Oh, it's not that. This whole situation is like a... like a bad dream. I expect any moment to wake up and find it didn't happen. - Oh, Helen! - It's true! And the worst part of it is that I'm the only one that can see it. - Oh, Alan, let's go, please. - That is ridiculous. - I mean it. - I know you do. You'll forget about all of this in the morning, you'll see. There'll be no morning for us. What's the matter? - You called me. - No. Go to sleep. You said, "Helen". I did not. Somebody... somebody called my name. You dreamt it. (Footsteps, banging) Alan! What is it? Well? It's, um... it's Klove. Klove? - Well, what's he doing? - I don't know. It seemed as if he was pulling a trunk along the corridor. - I'm just going to find out. - Alan! Don't leave me. Oh... I'll only be a moment. Lock the door after me. (Thunderclap) (Groans) (Thunderclap) (Thunderclap) (Gasps) Madam, your husband... Will you come quickly? (Thunderclap) I'll wake the others. (Sobbing) (Charles) Klove. Klove. - Have you found them? - No. All their luggage is gone. Well, they must be here somewhere. We've looked everywhere. I want to leave. - Darling, we can't leave without them. - Oh, please, Charles. I'm frightened. All right. Come on. No, Charles, I won't allow it. Darling, I've got to go back there. But at least go to the village first and get help. What help? As far as the villagers are concerned, that castle doesn't exist. - But then I'm coming with you. - No. Now, in this case I want no argument. You stay here. I go to the castle. That's all there is to it. Is that clear? Oh, all right. It's 2:30 now. I'll be back before 6:30. - It's dark by then. - Oh, you're not frightened of the dark. Well, I am here. You'll be quite safe in there, darling. I'll try to be back sooner. Take care. Yes, of course I'll take care. (Wind howls) Klove? (Horse-drawn carriage approaches) I hope I haven't startled you, ma'am. Klove, what are you doing here? Your husband sent me to fetch you in the carriage, ma'am. - Where? - He will explain everything to you. (Lock rattles) We've been waiting for you, Diana. We've been waiting for you. Helen. Where's Charles? There's something wrong, isn't there? Where's Alan? Nothing's wrong. Come, sister. Where's Charles? You don't need Charles. (Screeches) (Screeches) (Shrieks) (Charles) Stop! Let her go! Dear Charles. Let me kiss you. Oh, Charles. Diana, get away. Charles! (Shrieks) Diana! (Diana shrieks) Charles, the gig! (Horse whinnies) I warned you not to go anywhere near the castle, Mr Kent. (Charles) I read about vampires years ago. I always thought it was the product of an over-fertile imagination. Would that it were, Mr Kent. Here in the Carpathian Mountains, vampirism was an undisputed fact. And the fountainhead of this obscene cult was Dracula himself. I thought we'd seen the last of him. The last record we have of him is... Ah, here it is. Ten years ago. From what you tell me, it was your unfortunate brother who provided the life force for his resurrection. Then... I must kill him. Not kill. He is already dead. He is undead, Mr Kent. He can be destroyed, but not killed. How... destroyed? There are a number of ways. Ha can be traced to his resting place during the daylight hours and there staked through the heart. He can be exposed to the direct rays of the sun. Running water will drown him. The cross will burn him. He is not invulnerable. You make it sound comparatively simple. To skin a cat, first catch it. Huh! It is not simple. On the contrary. It is an extremely difficult and dangerous undertaking. You see, there are people who will help him, apparently normal human beings who aren't vampires themselves, but who, for reasons we don't understand, are in his power. This Klove is such a man, spending his life at the castle, waiting for such an opportunity as you presented him with last night. A chance to resurrect his master. How is she? Admirable. Another 24 hours and she'll be as good as new. Ludwig would like to see you, Father. Come with me, Mr Kent. Ludwig should interest you. He was a traveller like yourself. I found him one night near Castle Dracula. Something he had seen or heard unhinged his mind. He lost his memory completely. I brought him here. And here has remained these past 12 years. Oh, he's a contented enough soul and a brilliant craftsman. - Good day, my son. - Good day, Father. What can I do to help you? I seek shelter for the night. I'm sorry, my son, but I have orders to let no one in tonight. You're welcome to rest here. I'll have the kitchen send you out some food. Thank you, Father. Â¶ Rum te diddle de dum, te diddle de dum, te diddle de dum dum Â¶ Rum te diddle de dum, te diddle de dum, te diddle de dum dum... - Exquisite. Magnificent. - (Fly buzzes) Â¶ Rum te diddle de dum, te diddle de dum... Fly away, Peter. Fly away, Paul. Â¶ Rum te diddle de dum... (Door is unlocked) Flies, Ludwig? A small apÃ©ritif, Father Shandor. It will soon be dinner. Mm-hm. You wanted to see me? Yeah, I've finished the cover for the third folio. I... I wanted your opinion of it. Now, is it exquisite or merely magnificent? Exquisite. Eh, Mr Kent? - Beautiful. - Good, good. You may go now. Goodbye, Ludwig. Yes, yes, I'll send for you when I want you again. Why the security? Oh, he's a harmless enough soul, but he has been known to erupt. Come, we have things to discuss. We are in agreement, then. As soon as your wife has recovered we will send her home to England. Then you and I will do what has to be done. We will pull that castle down, stone by stone if necessary. We will find him wherever he is. I still don't see why we can't start immediately. No, it is better to wait until Mrs Kent is safely away. Last night Dracula was robbed of his prey, your wife. He has seen her and touched her. He considers that she belongs to him already. He will want her badly. He won't come here? It is unlikely, and even if he does, he will not get in. What the inhabitants of these parts don't realise is that a vampire cannot cross a threshold unless he is invited by someone already inside. And if he is, all the garlic flowers in the world won't keep him out. Yes, Master. Yes. Oh, darling, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. - Are you all right? - Yes, of course. You're the one we have to worry about. The important thing is to get you well enough to go home. Home? That sound marvellous. When do we leave? I won't be coming with you, not just yet. Why not? There's something I have to do here first. Oh, Charles, you're not going back to that place. - I have to, darling. - No, you don't. Oh, please, Charles, promise me that you won't. - We'll talk about it in the morning. - No! Now. Darling... I'm not leaving here unless it's with you. Now, Mrs Kent, no more talking. It's important that you rest. Father, you tell him. Tell him it's madness to go back to that place. I think your husband is right, my dear. We'll talk about it in the morning. - Now, Mr Kent, please... - Yes. Diana. Good night. Charles. She'll be all right in the morning. She'll understand what has to be done. I hope you're right. I think you'll find everything you need. - Good night, my son. - Good night, Father, and thank you. God be with you. (Tapping on window) (Tapping continues) Diana. Helen. Please let me in. It's cold out here. Oh, it's so cold. Everything is all right now. I've got away from him. Oh, please, Diana, let me in. I'm freezing. (Shrieks) (Screeching) Darling, what's wrong? What's wrong? - (Sobbing) - All right, all right. What happened? Tell me what happened! Sit her down. Hold out her hand. (Shrieking) For pity's sake! Enough! Brother Mark. Bring some salve and bandages. Well? We were just in time. Are there any strangers in the monastery? Only a tinker, Father. He's spending the night outside the main gate. Why wasn't I told this before? Spread some salve on Mrs Kent's wrist. Bandage it lightly, and remain with her. Come with me, Mr Kent. She'll be all right now. Come. That will prevent them from returning here at daylight. If we haven't caught them by that time, they will be exposed to the sun and they will be destroyed. (Door slams shut) We have caught the woman. She was hiding in the stables. - Dracula? - No. Take her to Ludwig's cell. If you wish to see the destruction of the horror spawned by Count Dracula, come with me. But I warn you, it is not a sight for the squeamish. Take Ludwig out. Go with Brother Peter, Ludwig. It'll be all right. (Groans) Now, bear in mind, Mr Kent, this woman is not your sister-in-law. She is dead. This is a shell. And what it contains is pure evil. When we destroy it, we destroy only the evil. (Shriek) (Recites prayer in Latin) Mr Kent, come and look. (Church bell chimes) Per istam sanctam unctionem indulgeat tibi Dominus, quidquid deliquisti. Amen. Ludwig, what are you doing out of your room? My room is being used for the most important matters. Father Shandor sends his compliments, Madame. Would you do him the honour of joining him in his study? - Of course. - But I... Everything's under complete control, Brother. There's no cause for concern. (Charles) Diana! Diana! Diana! Di... No! - Horses, quickly! - We will go after them. - But my wife... - Not in panic! Come! Take him back to his cell. Come, Mr Kent. Come along now, Ludwig. Come along. Come with us. They will head for the castle. Once there he will be safe, and your wife will be lost forever. We must stop them before he gets there. - It's more than a day's ride. - I know. This is to our advantage. - How? - It will be daylight soon. Already he will be thinking of returning to his coffin. Your wife will be safe until sunset tomorrow. Here. It would be better if you kept this. It is your rifle. You're used to it. No. We will not be shooting animals, Mr Kent. Klove is a human being. I may bend the laws of my office at times, but there is a limit to what even I will do. Come. We will saddle the horses. We've a hard day's ride ahead of us. Go on! He's making for the castle. - Will we be in time? - We've got to be. Go on! Go on! - We'll never make it. - No. - We'll cut across country. - Right. That's far enough. Get down from there. (Horses whinnying) Get out of the way! Come on, Mr Kent. Hurry, Mr Kent! (Charles) Diana. God be praised. No, you look after her. I'll take care of him. You must hurry. The light's going. (Shandor) It's too late, Kent. Get away from there. It's too late. - Why don't you shoot him? - It would do no good, my dear. Running water! (Wails)
