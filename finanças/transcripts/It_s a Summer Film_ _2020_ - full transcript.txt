Kosuke! What did you say? I said! I can't hear you! I said! Yeah? I... Yeah? I'm in love with you! Huh? "I Can't Help Loving You" (TBD) "80 days to school festival" What are you yelling for? I can't help it! I love you! So romantic! Karin is adorable. I know, right? I can't hear you! I should've zoomed in on you. Never mind, Director. It's a masterpiece. Thanks. Kaede! I love you! Me too! What? I can't hear you. You're so mean! We'll start with scene 26 at the park tomorrow. Production team, stay behind. Good job today. Good job! Barefoot! Kickboard! Film Club finished? Finished! See you, Barefoot. Yeah, bye. Barefoot! Kickboard! Working hard? Really hard! Shall we go to... Sure! You're so fast. Part 2? Part 2! "13 Assassins" "Throne of Blood" "Astronomy for Beginners" "Making a Samurai Film" The gods don't care whether you kill me or not. Shut up. Sorry. Blue Hawaii! Came straight from kendo? I thought you'd be gone. Come in. Zatoichi! Shintaro Katsu's so noble! The famous scene. You're so sweaty. Shut up. That stinks! "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time" Shintaro Katsu's so in tune with his surroundings. And he's sexy. Like this. You're so into him. Right? Raizo is way sexier. Remember him in "Satan's Sword"? Raizo is too beautiful. That's why I like him. What do you think? Dunno. But you always watch with us. You don't love samurai films. You just love us, right? Shut up. What are you reading? "Girl Who Leapt Through Time." I didn't know it was a novel. It's the original work. I'm not into SF. You should get into it. Barefoot, how's the film going? Not so good, I guess. All they say is, "I love you, I love you." A film should be able to convey love without words. Repeat "I love you" enough times and it becomes avant-garde. Ultra avant-garde. I liked your story, Barefoot. It's a lost cause. I can't even find a male lead. "I cannot kill you." Stop! "I cannot kill you!" Cut it out! "That's why I must kill you!" You! She ran away! Where are you going? Hey! Go! Go! Go! Go! So weak. Wait! We're just acting! Barefoot! Put your heart into it! Damn Kendo Club! Don't! I'm scared! I can't do this! See ya! Bye! Huh? What the... It's a Summer Film! "Have you ever been in love?" "I said 'No.'" "Do you want to fall in love?" "I didn't answer." Natsume Soseki suits you. Really? You have that novelist vibe. Distinguished, like. You mean I look old! - Seriously? - How old are you? How old do I look? Does everyone think that? Around 30 or so. No way. That's crazy. Why do I look so old? Insane. What about this? Ueda's fast ball. Bingo! Seriously? Of course. - You're a genius. - I know it. Your hearing's razor sharp. Outta my way! Excuse us. Sorry. No walking and texting! Oguri! Get rid of that weird bike! It's my baby. Your baby? Watch it! Stupid! I said stop! You're pretty fast, dude! Don't call me "dude"! You should make the film. "Samurai spring." I'll coach the sword fights. I'll help out too. Well... I read it yesterday. It's amazing. No... Do it outside of club time. The male lead... Inotaro, right? I can't find the right actor. What type? Vulnerable, beautiful... Like Kazuo Hasegawa. And the eyes. Eyes? Sad eyes that gaze out at the changing landscape. What about him? Nah... I was looking for you. Me? You like samurai films, right? I want to include some historical references in my shoot today. I need your help, Barefoot. Well, I guess... OK! All set then. Thanks for coming. What is it? Okinu... How do you feel about Kosuke? Okinu has feelings for Lord Kosuke. I see... A historical twist really adds to the worldview of the film. Karin's ideas are genius! Cut! That was great. Barefoot, I can tell you're really a samurai film fan. Well... I got goosebumps! OK! Let's play it back! OK! "Samurai Film Festival" Ow! Sorry! Excuse me! "Screening" Inotaro! Director Barefoot? Huh? Wait! Hey! Wait! I said wait! You're too fast! Hey you! Wait! Will you be in my movie? This is the script for my movie. I cannot be in it. You have to! It's decided. And don't talk so formal. I prefer to. "13 Assassins" I won it at an auction. "In Search of Mother"! You know it? I knew it! You love samurai films. So let's make one! What's it about? I wanted to make a teen samurai film. About kids around our age. I think it's a great idea, but I can't be in it. The last scene... Wait! Stop! I hate spoilers. What if the hero and his adversary never have a final showdown? What do you mean? They both get emotionally invested and can't kill each other. But samurai films have to end in a showdown. Or it's not a samurai film. What if another villain appears at the end and he gets killed? No! The story has to be about the two of them. They kill each other because they understand each other. Like in Zatoichi. That's possible... Very possible. Really? I think I got it. I think this is it. The ending. I'd better be going. - Wait! - Wh-what? I won't do it without you! Come to our school tomorrow. I can't be in your movie! Stop! Let go! - Don't run away! - Let go! "Astronomy Club" What are you reading? Heinlein. Hein... lein? In Astronomy Club? Yes. Space is pretty awesome, huh? I don't like pretty boys. - Me either. - I'm talking about you. Me? So I don't know how to interact with you. OK... "Space and Astronomy" "The Cosmos" "Space Travel" Can you untie me? Barefoot! Don't leave me alone with a pretty boy! Please untie me! - Where's Blue Hawaii? - Not here yet. Don't ignore me! Rintaro, meet Kickboard. Who is he? The star of "Samurai Spring"! - Huh? - What? I'm not doing it! "Samurai Spring" That's... I rewrote it. Let's make our own movie. A samurai film that will blow away Karin's tired, cheesy teen romance! You're really gonna do it? We'll screen it at the school festival and crush the Film Club feature! We'll show them what a real film is! Yeah! Let's change history! With Rintaro, we can create a masterpiece. You can do it! I told you I'm not doing it! Yes! I'm fired up now! Watch out, Film Club! What's going on? Blue Hawaii. Who's this? Look! Look! What about the budget? Well... The club only finances one film a year. This year, the funds went to Karin. Congratulations! "Karin"　　　　　　　"Barefoot" What will you do? "Yadokari Movers" This is too heavy. Wanna switch? Is this what you call heavy? Yeah. This one's heavier. Hey! Hurry up! Sorry! Watch this guy! - Carry that in. - Yes, sir! - Hurry. - Yes, sir! Rintaro is so dependable. Good work! Good work! I'm so glad you decided to be in my film. I didn't say I would. But I want you to make it. Without fail! That was passionate. No... Sorry I couldn't help! You won! Whoa! I rushed so I could help you guys but I didn't make it. You're so amazing! - Cheers! - Cheers! So how's the budget? We're still struggling. But with a few more moves, we might make enough. Then we can make the film. What? Nothing. Thanks for helping today. I'm not used to people doing the moving. It was kind of fun. Who else would do it? I guess. OK! Now for the supporting cast and crew. Let's assemble an A-list team! Yeah! Let's do it! Yeahhh! I'm not doing it. Lotion? More rice bran masks? Wait a minute! What is this? What's going on? Someone say something! Rintaro, this is heavy... I'll carry it! Please do the lighting! Why are you yelling? I'm not yelling. The lights! Do you like movies? Movies? "Samurai Spring" Final Draft Does everyone have the script and timeline? Thank you all for coming to make my movie. Your youth is mine, just for the summer. Just one summer. Oguri, I'm counting on your creative, yet bold lighting ideas, like your bike. Make them shine in the film. Gotcha. Komada and Masuyama. You hear a ball hit the catcher's mitt and know who threw it. You're in charge of sound. Yes! Daddy Boy will play Nenosuke, friend of Inotaro who's bent on revenge. Their relationship and how it deepens over time is the highlight of this film. Nenosuke... At the end, it's revealed that Nenosuke is the enemy Inotaro was searching for! It ends in a showdown. I'm getting nervous. Daddy Boy's recitation skills and classic samurai looks that belie his young age are critical for this film. Do I look that old? Thanks for coming, guys. And the star... Rintaro! Do I have to do it? It has to be you. I can't do it. I'll pay you! Sorry. I'll give you a movie pass! I can't. And my Mifune poster. No, really... - I really can't. I'm sorry. - What shall I do? Sorry. Fine. I give up. I won't make the film. What? You're the reason I'm making it. Just relax. Inotaro's opening scene. He returns to his hometown, sees how much it's changed and vows revenge. It's a key scene. Cut it out! Steady now. I am 17. The same age as you. Walk over and look down the river. How many steps? Inotaro walks down the road by the riverbank knowing he's walking towards death. Barefoot! We're standing by. Got it! - How many steps...? - Let's go. OK, here we go! I'll do my best! Scene 1! Rolling! And action! Cut! Rintaro, you're stiff. Sorry! OK! Scene 1, take 2. Action! They're in it. Komada and Masuyama. Cut! Sorry! Not you! Komada and Masuyama were in the frame. - Me? - Yeah! - It was you! - No, it wasn't! I was on the other side! A bike! Hold it! Sorry! The clouds are no good. Astronomically speaking. Which ones? Director. This line, "Huh?" I have five versions. You're getting into it. I'm serious about this. Inotaro is seeing how the town has changed which overlaps with his parents' death. Exactly. Hurry, Barefoot. "Huh?" The clouds are good now. "Huh?" Which one? Maybe version 2. That was the same version. Right. I'm getting hungry. I can't memorize this. What will I do? Scene 1, take 3. Ready? He's not as nervous. Looking good. Nice expression. - Hm? - What's that? A drone? Is that Karin? I love staring out at the shimmering water with you. I love sharing fried chicken with you. I love being with you. Me too! I can't help loving you! Do they really need a drone to shoot this scene? Calm down. Cut! Barefoot? Hi. Are you filming? Yeah. I'll come and watch yours too. I can't wait to see it. Yours too. Sorry! We're filming this scene next. OK! Thanks. No worries! Am I cut out for this? It's still our first day. We couldn't finish today's shoot at all. Sorry it was so disorganized, Rintaro. No... Rintaro! Finally! Why didn't you contact me? I was so worried. Look! I gained 5 pounds. Rintaro? Doc. It's been a while. What about the movie? I'm in it... What? Or else she wouldn't make it. That would be disastrous. Not making the film is disastrous. But so is being in it. So how was it? I loved it! I play the lead role. I had lines. And... Director Barefoot shot it! This is amazing. I may have talent as an actor. No, I do. You're too lax about this! I wish you could see it. But acting is hard... Whoa! Shall we give it a go? One! Two! Three! No, Rintaro! Daddy Boy, continue. Straighten your back! OK! You can't kill anyone like that! Rintaro, kill! Kill him! Director. Nice work. Thanks. You're still practicing. You're catching on fast. Not really. Here. You look cool. Yes! Who am I? Um... Mifune in Sanjuro! Yeah! That's it! What about this? Nemuri Kyoshiro's swordplay! Haven't seen that one. It's a masterpiece! I want to, but I can't find it. It's on Netflix. Netflix? You don't know Netflix? You're so out of it. What's your favorite samurai film? The first Zatoichi film? That's the best! My all-time favorite! Really? I'm obsessed with it. Do you remember the ending? Yeah! It's like... They glare into each other's eyes. Almost. It's more like this. Crouch down low. Your pupils are showing. You're so into the details... I wrote "Samurai Spring" because I wanted to capture this world. It's not even close, but... Were you rewriting it? Just now? Yeah... but it's not working. Which part? This part. When he decides to fight. Should he show emotion in his face? Kazuo Hasegawa! Yes, Hasegawa! Blue Hawaii loves him. Kazuo Hasegawa's masterpiece was... - "Gates of Hell"! - "Gates of Hell"! It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes! 2, 3, 4, 5... Lower! 6, 7, 8... 9, 10! This scene! This part! Like this. There! Like that! That's it. Why are you sleeping? Be serious! The two of you have to be in perfect sync in the killing scene. Even your breathing. The final scene has to be bold... You can do it! - 'Morning, Blue Hawaii! - 'Morning! The Kendo Club! Thanks for coming! Hello! - Nice! - We're all set! - Nice! - Good shot! Great! This is awesome! How's it going? No worries. Ready, Rintaro? Let's nail the final battle scene. Rolling! Ready? And action! Cut! Rintaro is so cool in this scene. Really. Right? It's so good. Yes! - Marshmallow? - Marshmallow. You've never tried it? No! You're too close! Your time's up. It's starting to come together. Is it? Yes, it is! This is so fun! I love it! Hey, Barefoot. Why do you like samurai films? Yeah. It's not that common. My grandma loved them. She looks just like her. She talked about them all the time when I was small. She was buddies with Raizo Ichikawa. She gave acting tips to Katsu Shintaro. Seems far-fetched. I believed her back then. When I was in grade school, she took me to a theater playing samurai films. That was my first samurai film. Zatoichi. I was so moved. What a mature kid. More than the story, I couldn't believe I was seeing the real Katsu Shintaro on the movie screen. I couldn't get enough after that. Movies... connect the present with the past through the big screen. Through my films, I want to connect with the future. That was embarrassing. I wanna say something deep too! Me too! Don't make fun! Cut it out! Still struggling? With the last scene. Think you can do it? Have you ever thought of writing your own script? How could I? But you love films. Give it a try. I'm a fan, that's all. Don't be so modest. I'm not. Films don't exist in the future. What? Stupid! Future? Did I say future? Films don't exist...? "Black Hole Time Travel" Who's that? My classmate, Doc. I'm borrowing his time machine. Time machine! Cool! Wh-where is it? Here. This? So tiny! Can I touch it? Try riding it. Question. Yes, Rintaro. I told you all I'm from the future. What happens to the time paradox? Well... You haven't disappeared. So according to science fiction, the time paradox is static. Exactly! Do you get it? Not really. I'm a great fan of yours. Mine? In the future, you're a master. Barefoot! A master! Oh. Yay. Idiot! Did I say something wrong? The world hasn't disappeared. The paradox isn't happening. Maybe it's a convergence of two worlds. I've been following your filmography. I've memorized all the dialogue. This is crazy... But there's no record of your debut film. "Samurai Spring"? The footage is gone, but there's evidence that it screened. On the day of the school festival. So you came here just to see that? You're insane. I never thought I'd be in it. So... Films disappear? In our world, a film lasts 5 seconds. What the... A whole film would run during that short silence. A minute is a super long film. Theaters don't exist anymore. That's great! I fall asleep in those 2-hour features. Idiot! What? Nothing. In the future, no one has time to hear other people's stories. Are you OK? About what? Nothing... I knew something was weird. You and Rintaro were always together. Yeah. You knew, didn't you, Kickboard? That Rintaro was from the future. I... thought maybe you were in love with Rintaro. No way. I see. Because the one who's in love with him is... Huh? Nothing. What? What is it? Nothing. What? "The future..." "I can't kill you..." Stuck? This scene. The climax. Where Inotaro bids Nenosuke farewell and kills him. I don't know anymore. But the shoot starts tomorrow. How about this...? Sorry. I want to be alone. OK... "Climax - Beach Scene!" "The Tale of Zatoichi" Good bye... Straight line to the horizon! The earth! Is round! Hey! What happens next? Well, next... We shoot... Director. Kickboard. Let's go check that area out. OK. It's almost over. Kill me like you mean it. Yes... Will the building be in the way? Barefoot. Huh? Did you have a fight with Rintaro? Why? No way. Maybe that way. They're becoming real samurai, aren't they? This is it! Ready, action! "I love you" Cut! That totally ruined the mood. Catch me! No, catch me. No, catch me! No, catch me! Not again. Cut! This was great! One more time! Once more! We can't lose. Right? Yeah. Farewell! Cut! Sorry. Can you say it without looking at him? Looking this way. OK! Farewell... Cut! Sorry. Farewell. Cut! Farewell. Cut! Farewell! Cut... - Fare... - Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Take 58... Barefoot. Shall we call it a day? But our schedule... We won't get anywhere today. Karin's crew is annoying. "Catch me!" - That was good... - That was terrible. Yeah. Terrible. Is Barefoot OK? Oh, you're staying here too? You guys too? Yeah. How's it going? Great. We won't lose. We won't lose to you. Right? Yeah... Is it a competition? For Barefoot, it is. She wasn't even on my radar. Where's our director? This sucks. Sorry. She'll be fine by tomorrow. Will she really? Barefoot is really struggling. That's when we have to be a team! Let's bond! Shut up! Please be quiet. Let's run, Rintaro! Not in the mood. All we can do is work out! Come on! Misumi High School! Go! Fight! Go! Fight! Misumi High School! Go! Fight! Go! Fight! Blue Hawaii. What's up? Seen Barefoot? Where is she? I can't find her anywhere. Can we stop now? Daddy Boy is going to bed. Director. Why? Stay away! I'm coming! No! Let's make the movie! Movies are going to disappear! It's meaningless! Are you stupid? It's not meaningless! There are other masterpieces! I'm done! The future sucks! I'll make sure it doesn't disappear! What about the time paradox? It has to be you, Barefoot! It has to be you, Director. Because... I happened to see your movie and it changed my life. The film, the story was amazing. And I was able to meet you. You may think it's meaningless, but... I don't even know what I'm saying. It doesn't have to be my... It does! You said it had to be me. It's the same for me. It has to be you, Director! Your story is right here, right now. Because it's your movie. Um... um... I promise, I won't let your film disappear! I'll change the future! But how? With... unfailing effort! That's so random. Let's make the movie. Fine. Wait! Is this a rom-com? We were looking all over for you! Blue Hawaii? I thought you were making a samurai film. But here you are wrapped up in your own teen love story! You tricked me! I... I love... teen rom-coms, too! You love rom-coms? You got it all wrong. You should've told me. - No, wait. I don't... - I like rom-coms, too... No, I swear... Tanada! Wait. What happened? We're not really sure but she fainted. She confessed her love to him. And? He rejected her and she fainted from shock. What about tomorrow? We have to find another actress. There aren't any. Hey... Barefoot. Is it the ex-girlfriend role? Yeah... Ex-girlfriend? The one he can't let go. She's dead, but appears as a ghost on the beach. It's a key scene where Kosuke faces his past. I don't want to compromise. I think there's a perfect actress. About this scene... It's fine. I've already prepared for the role. She's beautiful. Blue Hawaii. Yeah. Bring up the lighting. I'm in love with someone. Yeah. Sorry. Why apologize? Because... Even if you love someone else... She's like a pro. She is a pro. Whoa. My love will stay with you forever. I love you, Kosuke. I can't help loving you. Cut! OK! That was amazing. A real actress. I was honestly moved! I was so nervous! - I... - Yeah? I love Rintaro. I know. I'm... going to rewrite the last scene. Sorry for all the changes. It's OK! We're at your command! That's what a director does. Films won't disappear. I won't let them. I refuse to say good-bye. I won't say good-bye to films. So Inotaro won't kill Nenosuke in the final scene. He won't say good-bye. They'll live the future, together. That's brilliant! Yeah! But... What? We have to shoot it in one day. That'll be tough. No, you can do it. Huh? We always repay a debt. Rintaro. Director. Sorry to change it up. Brokenhearted? Am I brokenhearted? I get it now. There will be plenty of other guys out there. Sounds like a line from a girls' manga. Yeah. We're ready, Barefoot! OK! Ready to shoot? The last scene. - Yes! - Yes! - OK? - That's good. Rolling! Retake scene 45. And... Action! Who's this? You don't know yet? Wait! I think it's... Suzaki? Wrong! Alex. This is too hard! You haven't improved at all. - Shut up. - What did you learn from us? Nothing. That's pitiful. Hey. How's the editing? Pretty good. Thanks. Snacks! Wow! - This is amazing. - Yeah. I can't help loving you! The title appears here, right? Sorry. "3 days to school festival" "Samurai Spring" Get rid of it? Yeah. "Samurai Spring"? You have to, after the festival. Rintaro doesn't belong there. That's why the film doesn't exist in the future? Why are you only telling us now? So we'd finish the movie, right? Sorry. Does Rintaro know? When should we tell Barefoot? After the festival. We have to make it the best screening ever! Yeah. Good work. Good work! This is so cool! It's great! "2 days to school festival" I can watch this over and over. They're not united in the end. Unrequited love is beautiful too. Maybe it's better this way. If it were my movie, I'd tell him. Even if it's not beautiful? I wouldn't want to see a hero that didn't try. I see. You're right. Are you writing a love story? Huh? Yeah! Stop questioning me! Where's your movie screening, Barefoot? Huh? We were gonna crash yours and show ours. That's terrible! Sorry. Let's make it a double feature. It's OK. Show yours. It'll be a contest. Thanks... "School Festival" "Film Club screening at 2 pm. Please enjoy!" "Samurai Café" Film Club screening at 2 pm. Thank you. Please come watch. We're the Film Club. Please come watch. It's finished. Nice work. Our summer masterpiece. Um, Barefoot... You should tell him. Tell him what? That you love him. Idiot! I think I saw a UFO. I should go take a look, as a member of the Astronomy Club. Why? Hi! It's finally happening. Yeah. Um... When the movie finishes... I'm going back to the future. I shouldn't linger here too long. I made up my mind. I see... So today is our last day. Yes. I will enjoy this film with the utmost enthusiasm. Let's walk around together! It's our last day! How about crepes? Crepes? There are no crepes in the future? It's a thin batter with whipped cream and fruits and... never mind! Let's eat one! Let's eat one! Whoa! - Is this all hand-made? - Yeah! I want to go there. And there! OK! Let's go. - Let's go! - No way! "Haunted House" "Samurai Café" "Astronomy Club" It's not very popular. You captured me here. Yeah. I was so nervous. With the paradox and everything. It was love at first sight. As Inotaro, I mean. You chased me down. You helped me with my script. I remember. You couldn't decide if you wanted him killed. That's right. Your opinion really helped. What did I say? "They kill each other because they understand each other." That's pretty good. That was the only thing you said. In the end, you decided they wouldn't kill each other. Yeah. The Film Club screening begins at 2:00. Please come to the gym to watch! It's starting. Thanks for coming! Please enjoy. Film Club Double Feature "I Can't Help Loving You" "Samurai Spring" Kickboard! Where's Barefoot? She should be here. It's starting. Are you OK? I can't wait. Right? I came. Thank you, everyone, for coming today. Too formal! I guess. Today, we'll be showing the Film Club's feature film and the losers' film in a double feature. We're not losers! First, the film I directed. "I Can't Help Loving You." Please enjoy. Barefoot! And Rintaro. You made it. We made it. I can't hear you! What are you yelling for? I love you, so... I can't hear you! I love you! How do you feel about Kosuke? Okinu has feelings... I love you, Kosuke. I can't help loving you. Hikari! "Written and directed by Karin Tsukishima" A masterpiece! A real masterpiece! It's starting. Yeah. Barefoot's cherished... Debut film. Yeah. Let's burn it into our minds. Yes! "Samurai Spring" Huh? Is it too serious? That's OK. This is a masterpiece too. That was insane. You didn't know who I was. We have to settle the score! Director? What's wrong? Stop the film! What? Inotaro... I... I cannot kill you! What's going on? My best part's coming up! Is everything OK? I'm the director of this film. Sorry to stop it midway. But... this isn't the last scene I wanted. I realized samurai films are love stories. For the protagonist, there's only "one" ultimate rival in the world. And that "one" is his destiny. So in a sense... it's like a love story. I'm sure you think I'm crazy. I am crazy. Kickboard! Blue Hawaii! Rintaro! Daddy Boy! Oguri! Komada! Masuyama! Sorry! But I want to remake this. Come on, Komada. Masuyama! Over here, Rintaro! Over here, Daddy Boy! Hurry! Sorry, can you make space? - What can we use? - These! We need longer ones! No matter how much you love your rival you have to kill him. Face him in the end! So right now, I'm retaking the last scene. This moment is the movie's real climax! What are you doing, Barefoot? We're filming a movie. Kickboard! Rolling! This is it! Daddy Boy? This last scene isn't about me. Come on, Barefoot! Square off! Everyone! This is the climax! Killing is a confession of love. So I'm going to drive this sword right through your heart. What I mean is... In other words... Rintaro. I love you. I love you, too. So romantic... Rintaro! When this festival ends... we have to destroy this film. She knew... It's a shame. But... Even if we destroy it it won't disappear. You saw it. You watched me. When I saw my first samurai film it moved me. I started making movies to connect that emotion with the future. Now you saw this movie. You'll take it into the future. Right? Of course. I'll make movies in the future. Are you serious? The ultimate climax! It'll be a lot of work, but I'll do it! I love this story. Promise me. I'll surpass this last scene. We're rivals then. Yes. If we're rivals, we have to fight to the end. Of course. Bye bye. Good bye. It's a Summer Film!
