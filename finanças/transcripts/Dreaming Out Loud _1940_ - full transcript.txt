Good Morning, Abner. Morning. Can we have some gum? Can we have some gum? Come on! That boy is a spitting image of his pa when he was a kid of a boy his age. Come on, come on. Out of the way, Bessie. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Stubborn, I don't care. We need some ordinances in this town, Abner. Ordinances? Yeah, some new speed laws, way these cars whiz up and down the streets, it's worth a body's life to walk around the time. Yeah. Morning, Daly. Morning, Daly. Morning, Abner. How's grandma this morning? Well, she appears to be on the improve. Well, I'm proud to hear it. Poor grandma, she just went down something wonderful, ain't she? Yeah, well, I don't know whether she's as sick as she lets on or not. Grandma always did enjoy poor health. Morning, Moe. Morning, Moe. Morning, Abner, Lum. Yeah, morning, boys. We're not boys! Darn it, I can tell. The town's growing, Lum. Hey, Lum, have we got a sale going on now? Sale? No, not that I know of. We ought to take them signs down then. They've been hanging there for over two years. Well, leave them up. We might decide to put on another sale some day. And if we do, they'll be there. Yeah, yeah. Talking about signs, look at the sign you put on the door there last night, back in a few minutes. I must have hung up the wrong one, I reckon. Dog it, I'll fix it right this time. We're open now. Yeah, that's right, ain't it? Supposing somebody to come down here last night wanting to get in the store and seen that sign hanging there? What do you suppose they'd a done? Well, they'd a went on back home, I reckon. You know nobody ain't going to stand there and look in the door all night. Granted, I wished I'd got myself a partner that can think. Is that so? Well, let me tell you something, Lum Edwards, if I'd did any thinking, I wouldn't have been your partner. Now, don't start no argument. I ain't arguing. We will be in a few minutes. You started it. I never done no such a thing. You did done it, said you'd wished you'd got a partner that could think. I still wish it too. There you go again. Where's that rope? What are you going to do, hang yourself? I hope so. I'm going to run it right down through the middle here and divide up the store. You're not going to do no such a thing. I am done it. Get that broom and get this store swept out. You see it my way. Always something wrong around here. Wait a minute here. Oh, maybe that's a good idea... What do you think you're doing? I'm setting a trap for old Grandpa Master, see him run his hand down this cracker barrel. I'll get him. You wait and see. Like another one of them drummers. And a good, good morning to you, gentlemen. Morning. Well, this is a mighty fine little place of business you have here, very modern, very up to date, kind of unusual for a town of this size. I'd say she's on the bean. She's in the groove. How are you, grand pop? The boss in? I'm the boss... or half of him... I mean, 50/50 with him. Well, that's fine. That's fine. I'm Peter Atkinson, traveling salesman for the Hotchkiss Drug Company, Incorporated, home office, Chicago, Illinois, introducing a new line of bath salts that I'm sure you gentleman are going to be interested in. Well, why would anybody put salt in their bath tub? They don't taste the water. Why, of course not, grand pappy. This bath salt is just to perfume the bath water. And it comes in six delightful fragrances. We have violet, [inaudible], rose, and lavender. I'm afraid we wouldn't be interested. I can't understand it. You haven't even given the product a trial. Yeah, I'd love to see you in a violet bath, Lum. Now you're cooking, Pappy. And as I said before... No, I'm afraid we wouldn't have no sail for nothing like that around Pine Ridge here. We just take our baths straight. Well, as a special introductory offer, gentlemen, we are giving away absolutely free... What free? Absolutely free, this little gadget that we call the tidy tape wrapper. What's it for? It's for wrapping packages. You mean that little gadget right there wraps packages? That's mighty interesting, but, see, we always use string. I don't know now, Lum. This might come in right handy. Now you're cooking, Pappy. Not only that, this is a very modern little item. And if you fellas don't mind me saying so, your store is in a very rundown condition. Fact of the matter is, your town is in a rut. Now, if you'll try my bath salts... They'll get us out of the rut, huh? Yes. Now, if you'll just sign this little piece of paper accepting this gift so I'll have a little something to take to the home office. Why, sure. I'm going to leave you a bottle of these salts too, Pappy. Thank you gentlemen, thank you. Thank you very much. And your case of bath salts will arrive about the latter part of next week. Wait a minute. We never bought no bath salts. I beg your pardon. But your partner signed for the case. Huh? Gentlemen, you will find that I've done you a great favor. And you'll receive a bill from the home office. Good day, take care of yourself. And until I see you again next year, don't take anyone's nickels. Corny, ain't he? Yeah, such priddle paddle. Bath salts. What will they think of next? I wouldn't have bought nothing from that smart Alec, come in here knocking our town, saying we're in a rut. Who ask him about it anyway? Well, I don't know, Abner. He ain't all together wrong. Pine Ridge may not be needing bath salts. But there's lots of things they do need. What? Well, we need a new school house. Oh, yeah. Or to have some traffic lights to slow down these racing drivers around town here. And a first aid station to take care of the folks they run over. Yeah. That's our ring, ain't it? I never pay it no attention. Yeah, yeah, maybe it was, yeah. I thought it was. Better go answer it. It's too early in the morning. For goodness sake's, Abner. Well, what would anybody be wanting this time of the day? Well, go find out what they want. I wished I had the fella by the neck that invented these things. Hello, General Store, Abner Peabody talking. Long distance Adamstown calling. Must be Ken calling our post mistress. Hello? Ken? I reckon you're calling for Alice. Well, she ain't came in yet. Morning, Alice, you're wanted on the phone. It's a good thing I ain't about 40 year younger. I'd give you some competition. Oh. Abner Peabody, give me that telephone. Yes, dear? Listen, Darling, I won't be able to get over today. Disappointed? Of course I am. That's what I get for being engaged to a young doctor. She just arrived. And you should see her. She's a beauty. I'm looking at her right now. If you could see it, you'd know why I'm so thrilled. It's a miniature hospital on wheels. It has everything, the newest thing in medicine. And what a God send to a country doctor. I think I'm as thrilled about it as you are. Yes, I'll tell your father. Goodbye, dear. Ken got his new mobile unit. And is he excited. Well, good. Good for him. Ain't many towns that would by a young doctor a contraption like that. Well, there's Jimmy with the mail. Abner? Morning, Jimmy. What do you know, Sis? I made it from the depot in a minute and 42 seconds flat. Well, that's the best time yet. Hey, Jimmy, come here. Would you take this over to the Abernathy's for us? Abernathy's? I thought we decided not to send no more stuff over there on a credit. Oh. Ain't paid a nickel on her bill in over four months. No, well she brung this list over here yesterday evening. And I just couldn't hardly say no to her, Lum. She's got all them young 'uns over there to feed. I cut out a can of sorghum. I figured they could do without that. Yeah, but we can't keep sending stuff over there, Abner, when we know we ain't going to get paid for it. No, no, I guess you're right. Hand them back, Jimmy. Wait a minute. What do you think you're doing? I'm just going to pick this stuff back on the shelves. You give them back to him. What do you want them children to do over there, starve to death? Go on, Jimmy. Take them on over there. Put it back, take it, put it back, take it. Jimmy? Better take a can of them sorghum along too. Yes, mister. You've got as much judgement as a two-year-old young 'un. No wonder we can't make no money in the store business. We're still in business. Ain't we? Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to announce the arrival of a new citizen at Pine Ridge... time, 6:45, weight, eight pounds four ounces, name Michael Patrick Dolan. Another? Yes, and am I tired. Any patients been upstairs since you opened. No, not that I know of, Doc. Morning, Toots. Dr. Walt, how many times have I told you it isn't Toots, it's Toots? All right, Toots, any mail? Not a thing. Good, I won't have a lot of bills then. What's the news? Well, your adoring son just called. His new mobile unit was just delivered. So he's not coming over today. Oh. Uh-oh, looks like the beginning of an awful bad day. Good morning, Miss. Good morning. It's just hard to think about Doc Walt being the same promising young fella that was courting Jessica Finch about 25 years ago. You mean she was courting him. Morning, Jesse, morning Will. Morning, morning. We was just talking about you. Yeah, I can imagine. What can we do for you? I've indicated the prices in the articles. And I want no substitutes. You don't know want no what? Substitutes. Oh, we ain't got none of that no way that I know of. Good morning, bright eyes. Any mail arrived Jessica? Quite a bit, here. Letters, requests for donations, everybody wants to get their hooks in your aunt's money. What have you got for me? Sorry, nothing at all. Not even a kind word? I'm awfully busy this morning, Will. You never seem to be too busy when a certain young pill peddler comes to town. Look, here I am, a successful attorney managing the affairs of the wealthiest woman in this county. And you go get yourself engaged to a half-baked country doctor who will probably never have a dime. Now how come? Did you ever hear of a thing known as love? Better grind some coffee, Abner. Pound the coffee. If she weren't so stingy, she'd get it already ground. You ain't got no old clothes you won't be needing, have you, Jesse? When I don't need my clothes, I sell them. What's wrong with that thing, anyway? Well, my keys! I ain't been able to lock my house for two weeks. As I was saying, Jesse, there's a family of folks living down there by the saw mill that's having a pretty hard road. You know the Hornsby's? Yeah. Well, Miss Hornsby is just about your size. And me and Abner was just thinking... I said when I don't need my old clothes, I sell them. I thought that's what you said. At the same time, it don't hurt to be little neighborly once in a while, sort of lend a helping hand. When I want a sermon, Lum Edwards, I'll go to church. Here, Lum, take this. I ain't preaching no sermon. I'm just trying to use common sense. Why don't you use a little of it yourself and finish my order? I want a broom. Well, there they are. Which one you want? Oh, any one will do. What about the one there with the white handle? Oh, get that out of my face. Oh, careful! Excuse me, Jesse. Well, hurry up with the order. And take it out to the car. Oh, Will? Yes? Help Abner carry out the groceries. And see that my order is right for once. All right. Alice, did Jimmy get up to school all right? He's delivering a package for Lum and Abner on his way. Again? Why should he bother with those errands when they don't even pay him? But he gets so much fun out of it, Aunt Jessica. Well, I'll see you at dinner. Say, Lum, we got our grocery orders up. Now how about playing a game of checkers? I don't know, Abner. I don't much feel like it. Just one game. You ought to at least give me a chance to get even. Get even? You couldn't get even if you lived to be 400 year old. You owe me $6,720.25 now. Oh. You couldn't win that back at two bits a game if you lived to be 5,000 years old. That's the way I lost it. Ain't it? Yeah, but you ain't going to live as long as you did before. Ain't going to live as long as I... huh? Nothing, go ahead, I'll play you one game. You take the red. What's that burning? Oh! That's just Ed's shoes. He's got them too close to the stove again. He's going to sit there and give himself a hot foot. Wish to goodness that fella go to work. Well, he can't, Lum. Ain't none of his kind of work here. He's a steamboat man on the river. We ain't got no river in Pine Ridge. I know it. He said that's what he's waiting for. He'll go to work they ever put one through here. For goodness sake, it's your move. How much did you say I owed you? There it is. Read it for yourself. $6,720.25. Just one more game. No, I'm through, I tell you. Just one more, Lum. Abner, I've told you 1,000 or 100 times, I'm tired of playing. Well, I'll play for you, then. Play for me? Yeah, I can play for both of us. For goodness... that'd be a fine game. Well, I ain't going to cheat. That's our ring. Ain't it? Yeah, I believe it was. All right, I'll get it. Which color you want, Lum, the red or the black? I told you. I ain't playing. Well, I'm going to play for both of us. Now which ones do you want, the red ones or the black ones? I don't care, Abner. I'll give you the red ones. Here, if I'm going to do that I better move around here. General Store, Lum Edwards doing the talking. Which one of us moves first? Who? Oh, hi, Amy. Lum? Huh? Which one of us moves first? Oh, I don't care, Abner. You're playing. Run the game to suit yourself. What was it for you, Amy? It's your move, Lum. Huh? I ain't talking to you. Oh, excuse me. 24 or 48 pound sack? And I'll move right there. What else then? Just a minute. Abner, have we got any more of them seed potatoes left? I don't know, Lum. Don't bother me. I got troubles of my own here. You just made an awful good move. I did, huh? I tell you. I'll look and see directly if we have. How many did you want? It's your move. Oh, no, I moved right up here. And I moved right up there too. But I moved here last. And I moved from there right up to here! I can't hear what you're saying. Abner, will you cut out that yelling! I weren't yelling. I'm arguing. Well, cut out arguing, then. Well, you started it. I never done no such a thing. I mean here at the checkerboard. You said it was my move. And it weren't. Well, if you can't play for me without arguing, just leave me out of the game. See there, smarty? Now what else for you? I told you it was your move! All right, I'll move! I'll move right there... wait, and I'll jump you! And I'll jump right in there! You'll have to talk louder. I can't hear a thing you're saying. Huh? I'm going to have to call you back. I can't heart you. But then I move right there! Abner, for goodness sake, how do you expect me to take down a grocery order and you carrying on like that? Well, Lum, you was accusing me of making a move that I never made here. What better be doing is closing the store up. Closing the store? Why, sure. Is it that time of day? Better pull them front shades down before some customer comes in here. Well, I dog it. Good night. I'd began to think Wes had forgotten this was the 15th of the month. He just lives and drinks from check to check. Doesn't he? Hello, Doctor. Is my pension here yet, Alice? There you are, Wes. Can you do this, Lum? I don't know, Wes. Abner, we ain't got $18 in the cash drawer we could cash a check for Wes, have we? Uh. $18 is a pretty big check for us, Wes. Yeah, suppose you wait till tomorrow and take it to the bank. Pa! Give me that check. Bethy Lou, I told you to stay home. This is no time for little girls to be out. I wouldn't be out if you wasn't. I reckon you better give it to her, Wes. Now, you sign it, Pa. Come on, Jimmy. Goodnight, Dr. Barnes. What else for you now? Some ketchup. Bottle of ketchup, and there's your corn. And there's your tomatoes. Oh! Granted that's good enough for you. I want a cheap tablecloth. Cheap table... Abner, get one of them red and white tablecloths over there. And a package of cheese. Will I get any change at all? Oh, here. They you are, Wes. Thank you for your business. Pa just don't know how to handle money. That's his trouble. Yeah. Did you take out enough to pay our bill? Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all took care of. Sure? Why, sure, you don't ever get something for nothing at the jot 'em down store. Do you, Abner? Oh, no, no sir, no. Come here. I want to show you something. How would you like to have one of these new handkerchiefs? All Mother Goose rhymes. Take any one you want, just the thing for a little girl like you. There's Simple Simon, and Jack and Jill went up the hill, and Humpty-Dumpty, and Little Red Riding Hood. Can I have Little Red Riding Hood? Why, sure you can. You're so awful nice to me. Strictly business. Here's your tablecloth, honey. And I throwed in a pair of gloves for your Pa, if he ever goes to work. Thank you, Mr. Abner. Don't mention it, honey. Don't mention it. How much did they owe us, Lum? I don't know, Abner. I never paid no attention. We can't make money doing business like that. We're still in business. Ain't we? Say, Washington, that ain't Jessica's car! Get Doc, quick. Doctor! Doctor! I'd be feared to move her till Doc gets here. She might have some broke bones. Yeah, best not, what happened, honey? Bethy Lou. Pa, take care of yourself coming home. Let me have her, Wes. Phone Kenneth. Tell him to get that mobile unit over here as quickly as possible. Yes, Doctor. Are you gonna tell? I don't know whether I ought to or not, because of Jessica... no, I'm not gonna tell. And you've got to promise not to say anything. Okie-doke. Hurry, Ken, please hurry! Ken should be here any minute. It won't matter now. Might have gone with her. You can't think that way, Wes. Nobody ain't going to blame you, Wes. Well, old Wes is taking it pretty hard. Seems to blame himself for everything that happened. Yep. I wish Kenny could have got here. But 80 miles is a lot of ground to cover when it's a matter of time. Yeah, I reckon so. What are you thinking about, Lum? I was thinking about what that drummer fella said this morning. Drummer? At a time like this? Yes, I believe he's right, Abner. What this town needs is more progress. If we'd have had one of them first aid units like they got over at Adamstown there, little Bethy Lou might still be alive. Oh, yes, she might be, Lum. Well, goodnight. Goodnight, Lum. I'm kind of glad Ken's staying over. We'll do some fishing while he's here, I expect. Fine weather for it, Doc. All the signs is right. Ain't no doubt about that. Fella would have to get behind a tree to bait his hook. Doc, you recollect the last time you went fishing? Had little Bethy Lou with you. How has Wes been behaving since the accident? Ain't touched a drop. And says he don't intend to. I just wonder, I reckon how long Wes is going to be able to keep them good intentions, not having nothing to do except sit around and think about Bethy Lou. You're quite a psychologist, Lum. And you're right. Wes should be kept busy at something. There's nothing like hard work to keep a man on the street and narrow. Yeah, something like sweeping out the store. Well, hardly that, I mean a job with a certain amount of dignity. Wes should be kept busy at something that carries a lot of responsibility. Yeah, responsibility. And accepting the responsibility and duties of Deputy Constable, do you hereby solemnly swear that you will uphold and enforce the law at all times to the best and utmost of your ability? I do. Then as Constable of Pine Ridge, with this badge, I do hereby pronounce you man and wife. That's what comes of being Justice of the Peace too, you see. I now pronounce you Deputy Constable. Thought he might marry you off, Wes. Brother officer. Thanks, Caleb. I won't fail you. I know you won't, Wes. I got a surprise for you. Come on. What is it? Oh, you know. Oh, that, yeah. There you are, Wes. That's all yours. That a dandy, Wes? That's a real one. Ain't it? Got a siren on it and everything. All you got to do is stop on it. Electric headlights and everything. Wes, your to use that car specially to catch reckless drivers. Listen, Caleb, I'll put the fear of the Lord into them. You can bet on that. Well, Wes, good luck. Thank you, Chief. Well, howdy, Jimmy. Hello, Mr. Abner. Meet our new Deputy Constable, Jimmy. No fooling? No fooling, Wes is now the law. Any time you do wrong, Jimmy, you better come clean. I don't know nothing, Mr. Stillman. Well, who said you did? See what respect and fear that badge will give a boy? Say, Wes, we'd like to help you. Now, Lum's got some ideas on tracking down the fellow that run over Bethy Lou. Do you have, Lum? Well, Uncle Henry Lundsford was telling me after the accident, he seen some headlights turn in that lane nearby his place and stop. Somebody got out of the car, and looked it all over right good, and then got back in the car, and turned around, and drove back to town. Well, now my idea is this. Whoever run down Bethy Lou lives in Pine Ridge. For if it had bit of an out of town car, they'd of kept right on going. Sounds reasonable to me. Well, supposing we go down there and look the place over then. All right, get in. By dog, this is an uncommonly fine car you got here, Wes. Well, now according to what Uncle Henry said, the car must have turned in off the main road right about here. I brung Elizabeth's reading glass along. Thought we might could use it. For goodness sakes, such foolishness. Now, we want to keep our eyes peeled for clues, fellas. Clues? Yeah, tire tracks, and footprints, and one thing and another. Oh. Say, was it a big car or a little car Uncle Henry seen? Well, he never said which. But the way I had the thing figured out, the car must have come... Lum! Abner, will you shut up? Me and Wes is trying to figure this thing out. Car must of... Well, Lum! Lum! Abner, will you shut up? Car turned down here, and stopped, and then backed up here, and turned around, and went right on out the big road - ...there. - Help! Help! Help! Lum! Come here, Lum! Get that thing off! Get it off! What thing? That varmint on my first there! Get him off! Get him off! That ain't nothing but a little old ant. Ant nothing, you never seen a ant that big in your life. Knock it off, Lum! You're looking at it through that enlarginifying glass. That thing exaggerates. Oh, looked big enough to bite a fella's arm off. For goodness sakes. Lum, what I want to show you is this heel print here. Well, we ain't interested in nothing you found, Abner. Heel print? Yeah, right there. Look at there, Wes. Whoever got out of that car was wearing rubber heels. And they left a four leaf clover on every one of the heels. Look at there. Lum, that's it. That's it right there! Congratulations, you sure figured it out. Uh... oh. Me and you ought to put in a detective agency, you know it. That's right. Reckon we ought to go tell the constable what we found? Right now. Come on, Abner. Me and Wes has got the thing solved. Lum, them things still look too big for aunts to me. That ain't no ant, you idiot. You ain't looking through that. That's a tarantula spider! Ah! Oh! Oh my goodness! Uncle Henry Lundsford told me that same thing. So yesterday I drove out there and looked for myself. You did? I sure did, careful too. And I didn't see no tire tracks, nor footprints. Why, they was big four leaf clovers on... Fellas, we going to have to get some different clues. Seems nice, sneaking up here for the day. Pine Ridge is still home to me. Yes, it is now. But from the moment you carry your bride over the threshold, we'll have to drag you out of Adamstown. And that'll be soon now. Not so soon. What do you mean? We postponed the wedding. You have? There wasn't much else to do after Alice's Aunt Jesse laid down the law. It sounded like a scene from East Lynn. When Alice goes out, Jimmy goes out too. He's Alice's responsibility. Got a bite there, son. Yeah, I know it. I'll let him get a good hold first. She's certainly been bitter all these years over your choosing mother instead of her. Poor Jesse. I suppose that means she won't send Jimmy through school. That's what it means. I tried to tell her I'd see to his education. But she thinks it's too much of a burden, until I get a little more firmly established. Sometimes if you wait too long, the fish gets away. That won't happen this time, Dad. I'll take these fish up to the car. How's everything in the kitchen, Darling? Won't be long now. Good. I see a chapel, the organ plays. I'm so excited, so proud. I beg your pardon. I was just dreaming of love. I walk beside you, right down the aisle. We fight our way through the crowd. I beg your pardon. I was just dreaming of love. With my imagination, I ought to write fiction, I guess. Just for illustration, I just dreamed up my wedding dress. We're close together. And your embrace helps to erase every cloud. I beg your pardon, your humble pardon. I was just dreaming out loud. You didn't tell me this picnic included a floor show. You know something, Alice? What? Well, when we do get married, I'll have the woman. I'll have the song, even if I can't afford the wine. With my imagination, I ought to write fiction, I guess. Just for illustration, I just dreamed up my wedding dress. We're close together. And your embrace helps to erase every cloud. I beg your pardon, your humble pardon. I was just dreaming out loud. My compliments to the chef. Thanks. I've just been telling Dad the bad news. And I guess he told you that when he married. No. Well, he told me. And, Ken, if there were just the two of us two consider, I'd marry you, even if you had less than that. Don't mind me. I'm an old country doctor. I've seen everything. Your tea. Oh, thanks, Alice. Feeling better? Oh, I'm all right, just a little tired. That's all. That case took a lot of you. That Robert's case, and Judge Porter's operation, and all of Mrs. Sawyer's children, and... oh, well, why am I telling you? You've been working entirely too hard, Dr. Walsh. No one can stand it. Well, somebody's got to be on the job. Hello, Alice. Hello, Caleb. How's Doc, Alice? He's pretty tired. He's resting for a while. Well, good. Come in, Caleb. Howdy, Caleb. Hi, Lum. Hi, Abner. I bring you some eggs, Lum. The Lynn woman says there's two dozen and four there. But you better count them. What's the matter with old Doc Walt? Is he ailing, Abner? No, he's just been working hard here late, just hard. Recollect the time, Abner, 13 year ago when I was took with a fever so bad? Everybody plum gave me up, except Doc. He stayed with me and pulled me through it. Has that been 13 year ago? Yeah, 13. 14, 15, 16. Dog it, time sure does fly, don't it? Yeah, I took down back in the spring of '27. 28, 29, 30. How old is Doc anyway? Oh, I'd say he's 50. Oh, yeah, he's past 50. 51, 52, 53, 54. And he ain't as agile as he used to be, neither. Look at Holden. He's 70. And he's still at it. More than that, he's 72. 73, 74, 75, 76. 76, I get, Caleb. 76? That's what I counted, Caleb. Let's see, 12 into 76... 12... that's six dozen and four. Six dozen and four? I think you were about to be counted out of four dozen eggs there. Did you want the cash firm, or just credit on your bill? Oh, no, just credit on the bill. How about selling me some of them prunes there, Caleb? I never did like prunes, Abner. You better take it easy, Doctor. Granted, we got plenty of eggs now. Put a set of these under old Ed over there. He's got a nice quiet disposition, ought to make a good mother. I don't know. Sounded like it was upstairs. As if someone were knocking. There it goes again. Must be Doctor Walt. We better go up and see. Doctor Walt! Doc? What happened, Doc? Just a slight attack. I can't seem to use my arm or leg. I'll be all right in a minute. Nothing like this ever happened to me before. Better call Kenny, Abner. No, don't call Kenneth. I don't want him to worry. Call him anyway, Abner, and hurry. Where does it hurt the worst, Doc? There's no pain. It's just temporary paralysis of the right side. That's all. Paralysis? Oh, Doctor Walt. Don't worry, Toots. I'll be all right. Here, let me make you more comfort, Doc. Ken, how is he? Oh, you poor darling. Will he be that way always? He'll be in that chair as long as he lives. Does he know? Yes. Oh, it's going to be terrible for him. He's so used to being active. I don't see how he's going to stand it day after day. He's a hard man to lick, Alice. You know what he just told me? He wants to carry on. Says his hand might be paralyzed, but not his mind. But, Dear, you know he can't. I know. And you can't leave him here alone. I'll get someone to stay with him for the time being. When he sees it... Then I'll hint to him as tightly as I can that he'd be better off in Adamstown with me. Don't cry, Darling. But, Kenneth, it's all so hopeless. Ed must be having another one of his night... or daymares. Yeah. How's Doc Walsh? He's pretty bad. Anything we can do to help? No, Abner, I'm afraid there's nothing anybody can do. Ain't you going home? It's getting pretty late. No, I thought I'd balance up my stamp account first. It's your move, Lum. Yeah. Now, now, now. Crying never helped nobody. I can't help it. Tell us what's worrying you, Honey. Well, it doesn't look as if we can ever get married now. I've got Jimmy to look after. And Ken's got his father. Yeah, things is sort of messed up, all right. I wouldn't bother about the post office tonight, Honey. Why don't you run on home and go to bed? Yeah, let me get your coat for you. Don't take it so hard now. You've been awfully kind, both of you. But there's nothing you can do. Well, now how do you know? Me and Lum's always been able to help everybody, except our self. Fact is, I've got some ideas right now. I'll tell you about them tomorrow. Run along now. Goodnight. And thanks. About time we was locking up. Yeah, I reckon it is. I wish we could figure out some way to get Ken over here. That's the only thing that's going to make Alice happy. I can tell you that right now. Yeah, well, you can't blame him for not wanting to leave Adamstown. Here they bought that new first aid unit for him over there. And he's getting along so well. No, no. Say, wait a minute. That's it. Huh? That's it right there. What? Be quiet. I'm thinking. Thinking about what? I ain't got time to explain it to you now. You wouldn't understand it no way. Now, listen, Lum Edwards, I want to know what it is. You finish locking up the store. And just leave the thinking to me. Goodnight. Well, uh... goodnight... er, goodnight! Well, Abner, what is it? I don't know. He wanted to talk to you. But he didn't want to talk to you without me along. But I don't know what he wants to talk to you about. All right, Abner. Look, gentlemen, Miss Spence is a very busy woman. Will you please state your business? We come here on a very important matter. Well, I'm waiting to hear what you have to say. It ain't nothing new, Jesse. I've said it before. But me and Abner has lived here in Pine Ridge about as long as anybody. And we'd like to see the town get ahead. And what is it you want me to do this time? Well, Doc Walt collapsed in his office last night, had a heart attack. He won't be able to make no more calls. And that leaves Pine Ridge without a doctor, unless we can get Kenny to come over here and take over his father's practice. Of course, we can't expect him to come back here unless Pine Ridge is willing to give him the same things as Adamstown. Miss Spence isn't concerned whether he comes back or not. Exactly. When I need a doctor, I call for a good one from the county seat. Well, Jesse, there's lots of folks here in Pine Ridge that can't afford to do such as that. So we thought if you'd head a subscription to buy Kenny one of them first aid units like they got over in Adamstown, we'd... You ought to know that I'm not helping either Dr. Walt or his son. You're wasting your time. Why don't you ask someone else to help you? Won't do no good. As Jesse goes, so goes Pine Ridge. Is that all you wanted to say? Well, not all we want to say. But all we better say, I reckon. Then if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some more business to talk over with Mr. Danielson. Come on, Abner. Thought I had more sense than to go out there and talk to her in the first place. Any business while we was gone? Yeah, Ms. Seastrunk was in, got a couple of cans of harmony and a can of baking powder. Well. Reckon where Alice is at. I don't know. She must have went out. There's a note there on the post office. Says, if you want me, I'm upstairs with Dr. Walt. Well, there's some mail she ain't sorted neither. Thought we might have a hearing there ourselves. James Houston... what in tarnation! Hey, hey, whereabouts you going, young fella? I wasn't doing nothing! Of course you wasn't. I don't know what you're going to hide from me and Abner for. I wasn't hiding. Honest, I wasn't. I just didn't want you to see me. Well, whether you was hiding or whether you just didn't want us to see you, it don't make no big difference. You mean, you really don't care why I was hiding? You don't want to know? Me and Abner always tends to our own business. Don't we, Abner? Well, uh, you do. Sit down, Jimmy. Let's talk this thing over here. How'd you know something was worrying me? Well, folks don't generally go around hiding and acting scared like unless something is bothering them. Here, have a apple. I'm not very hungry. Boys is always hungry enough to eat a apple. Sure. Haven't you got something you want to tell us, Jimmy? If I knew something important, something I've been keeping a secret, something I ought to have told, is that the same as lying? Well, uh, no, not exactly the same, but awful close. I don't know whether to say it's worse or better. Do you, Abner? Uh, worse I'd say, yeah. And this boy, we promised not to tell his name, says it was your car that run over Bethy Lou. How dare you! How dare you! We're just telling what we hear, Jesse. Do you realize the seriousness of these charges? Why, sure, but that ain't the point. The point is there ain't nothing lower than a hit and run driver. Now, just a minute. Let me handle this. There ain't no handling to it if it's Jesse's car. As Miss Spencer's attorney, I have a right to speak. Now, you're only ground for this incredible accusation is that some little boy told you that he thought he saw Ms. Spencer's car. Is that right? Sort of. Miss Spence, were you out of the house the night that Bethy Lou was killed? I was not. Now, think carefully. Did you give me permission to use the car? I certainly did not. Well, I, I think that's all. Except one thing. I see now. You had it all arranged. You came here and asked for money for that ambulance. And because you saw I wasn't going to be silly enough to give it to you, you deliberately thought up this lie about a little boy seeing my car run over Bethy Lou. You thought I'd be frightened and contribute to buy your silence. And in law we call that by the pretty name of blackmail. And if they dare say anything more about this, I want you to file suit at once for slander. And criminal libel. I think you'd better get out now. All right, Jesse, all right. Let's go. Well, now I've saw everything. This the first time in 30 years you've been down to work early in the morning. What are you reading? A book. Huh? Why, that's Doc Walt's baby photograph album you've got there. Abner, how many babies would you say gets born in Pine Ridge every year? 100, I reckon here in town, and in the country around here both. How long has Doc Walt practiced medicine here in Pine Ridge? Doc Walt? About 32 years. Abner, did you know that if every baby that Doc Walt ever brung into the world was to send in the small sum of $5, according to my figures here, we'd have more than we need. More than we need for what? That's what I've been trying to tell you. You ain't told me nothing! The first thing you can do is run up to Doc Walt's office and get that big book of baby addresses he keeps there in his desk. Yeah, but... well, I still don't see what you're driving at. Well, you don't have to see. Just go ahead and do what I told you. That's all. Well, where are you going? I'm going to go get that old printing press you let them fellas pan off on you. Now, Lum, don't bring up that argument again. I ain't jumping on you about it. I'm proud you bought it now, finally found some use for it. Well, good for me! So go on and get that book now, like I told you to. Baby addresses, printing presses, if I don't believe he's plum lost it. I reckon that ought to be enough. How you coming with the baby book? Well, it's a pretty big job. But I'm glad you're catching up with it, I reckon. Where you up to now? This one right here. Cute little tyke, ain't it? Yeah. Reckon he'll send us $5? This one over here's next. If ever I seen a boy that looked like he'd grow up to be a good for nothing, that's him. Oh, I recollect him... best behaved young 'un in Pine Ridge. Reckon whatever become of him after he growed up. His temperature, when all the... it's a cold. But Aunt Jessica, it's over 103. Good morning. Morning, Washington. Hardly anything at all. Jimmy needs a doctor. I'm going to call Dr. Walt and find out what to do. You'll do nothing of the kind. Dr. Barnes is not going to treat anyone belonging to me. But Aunt Jessica, Jimmy's sick, very sick. We can't be fooling around with home remedies while he gets worse and worse. Well, the cold will probably break tonight. He'll be all right tomorrow. I wish I thought so. I have simply got to have Dr. Walt look at Jimmy. If I don't, I'll never forgive myself or you if anything happens. Now, Alice, don't get dramatic. After all, I have Jimmy's welfare at heart too. I wonder. Alice! Yes, I wonder. I wonder if you haven't been blinded to everything by an old foolish jealousy. You've been unfair to Dr. Walt for something that happened such a long time ago. You've brooded, kept things pent up inside of you until everything you say and do is warped. You've become selfish, hard, cruel. And I've taken it from you because I wanted Jimmy to have a good home. Do you know you're saying? Yes, I know what I'm saying. I'm saying something I've wanted to say for a long time. I'm tired of listening to your veiled threats about Jimmy and me, catering to your narratives the way I have just to keep peace. Well, I'm through with all that. I'm taking Jimmy to Dr. Walt now. And you can do whatever you want to about it. I don't care. We're going to see Dr. Walt, Jimmy. Then everything will be all right. $5. Well, $5. My goodness, here's one for $25, Abner. Look at here. 25! That's Alice. Yeah, reckon what she wants. Jimmy's terribly sick. He's in the back seat. Would you carry him up to Dr. Walt? Sure, sure. Yeah, sure. Oh, Dr. Walt, I'm afraid Jimmy's terribly ill. I telephoned Ken. But I don't know when he can get here. He was out on the case. Put him on that table. Don't uncover him. Hold your watch where I can see it, dear. Alice. Uncover his chest. That's enough. Have you taken his temperature? Yes, just a little while ago. It was over 103. How serious is it, Dr. Walt? Very serious, it's advanced pneumonia. Please, Dr. Walt, you've got to do something. You're the only one that can help. You can't let him die. I'll do the best I can, dear. But you, Alice, and Lum and Abner, you've got to help me. I don't know whether it will work. But you've got to be my hands. Anything you say, Doc. In that cabinet, Alice, you'll find a bottle of tablets, get them. And Abner, get me a glass of water. In cases not so far advanced as Jimmy's, those pills are almost a certain cure. Usually within 48 hours, the temperature drops to normal and the patient is almost entirely out of danger. But in Jimmy's case, the question is, will it have time to work? Give him two of those tablets, Alice. While we're waiting for it to take effect, the only thing that's going to keep Jimmy alive is oxygen. Oxygen, where am I going to get oxygen? Ain't that what they got down there at the garage? Them tanks of air? Er, no, that's something else, I reckon. You're right. Abner, you telephone the garage and have Caleb bring up a tank of oxygen right away. Hurry! Hello, Caleb? Have you got one of them tanks of oxygen over there? Oxygen! Them tanks of air! Yeah, well, get one over to Doc Walt's office just as quick as you can. If we're going to give Jimmy oxygen, there are several things I'll need. You've got to get them for me. I don't know where or how. But you've got to get them. First, I'll need a fruit jar, a big one with a top on it. That's easy. We've got some of them downstairs in the store. I'll get one. What can I do, Doc? I'll need something to punch two holes in the top of that jar. How about a leather punch? Will that do? I guess so. Get it. I don't need your help to get this jar. I ain't trying to help you. I'm going after something else. Lum? Aren't you going to wait on me? I want, um... I want a pound of coffee. You know where it's at. Help yourself. Take it all if you want it. How's that, Doc? That's fine. But I'll need two holes punched in the top. Let me do it. Now get some rubber tubing to fit those holes, about quarter inch. Rubber tubing? Where we gonna find that? I don't know. But get it. Come on. Let's go find it. Get it! Hey, Lum! Lum! Come here! Look here! Will that do? That's rubber tubing, all right. I don't know what Doc aims to do with it. But he's got something in mind he thinks will work till Ken gets here. Here's the oxygen, Doctor. Where do you want it? Put it there. Over a little further, boys. Thank you, Caleb. Wes, you stay here with me. I may need you. Yes, Doctor. Now we need something to fit over Jimmy's face, a piece of rubber to make a mask. Mr. Dr. Barnes, I don't exactly know what you mean. But could you use the bladder from Jimmy's football? Just the thing! Get it! How's that, Doc? That will do for part. But there's not enough. Well, that's all there was. Does it have to be rubber tubing, Doc? It could be metal. Why? I was just thinking, don't they use metal tubing in automobiles? Of course they do! Come on, Abner. I think I know where we can get some. And hurry! Alice, if Lum and Abner do get that metal tubing, it'll have to be thoroughly cleaned. So get a pan full of boiling water. Where are you going, Washington? Dr. Barnes told me to bring Jimmy's football. Football? What's he want with a football? Well, never mind that. Get that. There it is right there. Wait a minute, Abner. Look at there. Huh? Right there, caught in the car. By dog, Little Red Riding Hood. I reckon we was right after all, Lum. Well, we ain't got time for that now. Go ahead and get that tubing off of there. Here it is, Dr. Barnes. Well, that's fine, Washington. How's this, Doc? Give it to Alice to clean. Here, take this bladder and cut it in half to fit over Jimmy's face. Let me have your pocket knife, Abner. Here, take this tubing. Run one end of it through the hole in the top of that jar. Keep it above the water. Then attach the other end to that mask. Then seal the tube in the top of that jar with that wax. Is that metal tubing clean Alice? Yes, Dr. Walt. Take it, Wes. Now tape one end of it to that oxygen tank. Then run the other end through the hole in that jar almost to the bottom of the jar. Now if it works, the water will moisten the oxygen. Otherwise, Jimmy's throat could never stand it. Now, Alice, take that mask. Put it over Jimmy's face, tight. And hold it. Now, Wes, turn on the oxygen. Now, Wes, turn on the oxygen. Been up there for hours, wonder what's happening. Turn off the oxygen, Wes. Take off the mask, Alice. I think he'll be all right now. Oh, Dr. Walt. That's the nicest fee I ever received, Toots. I knew you could do it. Bring me over there by the window, love. I think I'll take a little cat nap. I'll get some kibble for you, Doc. You can all clean up for me. Sure. There you are. Here, Doc, let me put this around you. How is Jimmy? Oh, Jimmy's just going to be as good as new. How's Jimmy, Lum? He's not... oh, howdy, Will. Well, just the man we want to see. Ain't he, Lum? Yeah, I was just talking to Jesse. She says she does recollect giving you permission to drive this car the night Bethy Lou was killed. She couldn't say that. She didn't know I had it out. Oh, so you admit to it? Just a minute, Wes. Don't do nothing to him person. Suppose I did have the car out that night. That doesn't prove a thing. It's the word of a little boy against mine. Come on, Wes. I want to show you something. Look there, did you ever see that before, Wes? That's the handkerchief that Lum and me give Bethy Lou the night she was run over. Now, the rest of it's up to you, Wes. You're under arrest. Hello, Darling. How is he? He's resting easily now. Your father gave him medication and oxygen. Good. Dr. Walt's been absolutely wonderful. Is he asleep? Ken, is he... Friends, we're gathered here to lay to rest one of our neighbors. I ain't going to try to give a sermon about Dr. Walter Barnes. You can't give a sermon about a man that lived a sermon all his life. He was just a plane man that lived and gave his life to just plain folks here in Pine Ridge. And I guess all I can say, and all you can say in praise of a man like that is that he loved the world and left it better than he found it. Me and Abner tried to find some monument that would show how we all felt about Dr. Walt. Nothing we could buy or nothing we could build would be enough. Dr. Walt left his own monument. Morning, Abner. Morning, Lum. Hey, got any gum for us? Got any pennies? Don't no more get one generation of young 'uns raised around here, Lum, till we have to candy another batch. Yeah, morning, Jerry. Morning, Lum. Morning, Abner. Morning, Judge. $10 in cost daily. Never tried an innocent man in his life. - No. - Come on. Move over, Bessie. Get out of the way. Granted, they don't build these sidewalks wide enough. You know it? If I don't get you a rocking chair, Bessie, so you can sit over in the shade out of the way. Don't do that. She'll be moving into the store there with Ed. She might. My goodness, there she is, Abner. Who? The new first aid unit. Dr. Kenneth Barnes, MD. She's a beauty. Isn't she, Aunt Jessie? I never know whether you're talking about the ambulance or about Alice. This time I meant the unit. And we have you to thank for it. All I did was write a check for the balance due. Don't forget all the other people who chipped in. And don't forget Lum and Abner. They started it. I think. Well, we don't have to take no backseat to Adamstown now. We'll never have to take a backseat to Adamstown. Kenneth, do you mind if we take a look inside? Certainly, go right ahead. Now that's all right, you know it? Oh, it's pretty, it sure is, yes sir. Dog it, has Doc got a patient already? Sworn to goodness, not only got ourselves a new first aid unit. But we got rid of old Ed too. Well, it'll be a nice comfort place for him to sleep while he's waiting for them to put that river through here.
