Started right up. Where are they from? -Israel. Tell them to get out. And call Security. Security? You're needed. What is it? What's wrong? We have to get out. They want to search the car. - Search Area - What'd he say? To open our coats. I'm not taking my clothes off. Take our clothes off? Let's do this. Lucky they didn't shoot us. Come on, let's go. Look at you. Shmuel? Your folks lose anyone in the Holocaust? Talk about loss? My mom lost her siblings and her parents. My dad lost his sisters, brother and parents. They all evaporated... No uncles, aunts, grandfather, grandmother. Were your folks born here? Yes, in Dresden. Some name, eh. God forbid... I didn't know that. -I never mentioned it. Nobody survived? Drop it, Sisso, I've been hearing it all my life. Shmuel! Do I take this? Sure. They go with my pants. Looking great, Sisso. Real dapper, Sisso. Put the tie on. -No way, it's choking me. Some get-up! Where'd you find it all? He did. You look better than you did at your wedding! And me? The truth. -You look like a model. The shoes, too. Just cool. Fantastic! We'll keep this on. -Sure or we'll get arrested again. Hello, are you guests of the hotel? Shmuel, see what he wants. Hello. May I help you? How much? -500 Euro. Shmuel... -Sisso, it's on me. Mr. Kleiner, come to reception. What do you want to eat? What do I know? It's not kosher. Then go for fish. How about it? Sounds OK. Let's try it. Shmuel, come, it'll blow your mind. Look at this city. They have everything here. Life without any worries. Would you stay here? -What d'you mean? We stay. We sell the car we bring our families over. We don't need much. For 30-40 grand I'll put up a car lot. You joking. You said a few days. We pay 70% income tax, watch funerals on TV, each day we count our dead. How long will we walk on the edge? Adina'll be delighted. She makes how much 1,000, 2,000 Shekels? She works her fingers to the bone. She could have a Turkish cleaning lady. Your kids'll go to school and learn languages. Make a good future for them. Europe! You will miss nothing of Israel. What about that food? It's coming. Look at this. Everything's clean and shining. And quiet. No-one ever honks. Hard to believe all that happened here. Happened? It was just 60 years ago. How did your parents survive? They hid, got caught went to the camps, ran away again, jumped trains killed some Germans... Then they lay for 3 years in a freezing cellar. And you think you could live here? It's changed, people want to live here now. Food's here. To you! -To us! What's this? What is this? He brought us a snake! Disgusting! Gross... He touched it. Tell him to give us bread. Give him something so he goes away. My wallet! -What? My wallet is gone! -The money? Money, cards, everything! How much? -2,000 Euro. I can't believe it! -Wait. Calm down and think. What did you do? Where were you? At reception? -Never took out my wallet? Then where? -The store! Store? -The clothes store. Where is it? Get the bag, we'll ask for directions. C'mon! Hey! Anybody here? Open up! Not a soul. Think! Where did you lose it? Does it matter? My wallet's gone. What about the police? They'll tell us to come in the morning, but we have to be in D?sseldorf. That's all we have. -How much? 300 Euro. God told me to put it aside. Who're you calling? Pnina? Honey? Listen, we're in a hell of a bind. I lost my wallet and everything in it. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Everything! Call and tell them to block my credit cards as of noon today, and order a new set. Wait! Tell my bank to send me 1,000 Euro, urgently, to any bank in D?sseldorf. Yes, we'll be there tomorrow. Call back to tell me which bank it is. My regards to Adina. -Call Adina for Sisso! Goddamn. 2,000 Euro. What the hell. What about the hotel? All the food? We split in the morning. No choice. Without paying? We've got to go to AutoDecker. They'll send us a bill. There's no rush paying for that snake. Shmuel! C'mon, hurry up! Let's get out of here. There she is! -Slow down. Cameras. Pnina? What's up? What about the bank? What d'you mean they won't? What holiday? Hanukkah? They want us to eat donuts here? We're broke! Not before tomorrow? OK, never mind. Forget it Bye, Pnina. Not before tomorrow... Great. To hell with them. Shmuel, want some mayo' with your tuna? Yeah, lots of it. And some tomato. Be careful don't spill any. Mustard? Lay it on, I'm starved! Again with this music? Cut it out! Come on, one more minute! Just listen to it! -It's too loud. Look at her go! I'm going 90 mph steady. Who'd believe she'd been 20 years on the road? Here, Shmuel. Here. How about Pnina? Didn't she wanna come? She did. So? What did you say? I said, "It's not for you, baby, it's work." She understood? -Sure. She's not here, is she? Have a pickle. How did you two meet? We were 17 years old, just kids. Then army service then we got married... Nothing much happened after that. How old is she? -Same as I. Say, how long to D?sseldorf? We'll have the money by noon. Some traffic jam! Bumper to bumper. She takes 1 litre every 10 minutes. It's getting late. A German traffic jam... No honking no getting down on the shoulders. Complete silence. It's a Dress Parade. It's a different world. They took my mother's dad out, whipped him to death right there in the street. But even that wasn't enough for them. They sent them off in those trains. You've no idea what it was like. They'd take old bread from the street and bring it home. We had three rooms: for us, 1 for them and a third one for the bread. Look at these faces... I'd dream of those eyes at night... Like this? -Exactly. I'd lie there shivering. The blood-sucker. How old do you think he is? I dunno. 80? Go back 60 years, what've you got? Look, he's been living like a king. A wife, children, grandchildren... What are you looking at? What do you want? Do you speak German? American? Israel! What did he say? -Israel. Look at his eyes surely he was there. Shut the hell up! Shmuel, you OK? -Yeah, I'm fine. They'd better be open when we get there. Will you look at that! It's a dream! It's a palace! Look at this Jaguar! A real beauty! The cars of yesterday... Three wipers that never collide. Where do they get all the parts? It's a big market. Billions are in it. Look. It's hand-made. All hand-made. What's that? It's a Rolls-Royce. That's a Rolls? 6.5 ltr, 8 cylinders, wood and leather interior. Go on, check it out. May I get in? -Sure. How'll you buy it if you don't check it? Look at this beauty... And the colour... My God... Give me your cell-phone. Who you calling? -Give it. How do I call Israel? 00-972-3, then the number. Adina? Hi! How are you? -Tell her about this place. You won't believe it. I'm sitting in a... Some Rolls-Royce! All wood and leather. Out of this world! What? When?! A terror attack! -When? Some time ago. Where? -Where? In Tel Aviv. -Where? On Allenby Street. How many dead? Oh my God! -How many? 8 dead. -My God! A bus? In a mini-market. Adina! Are you alright? Is everyone okay? Are all the kids there? What, Moran isn't? Where is she? Find her and tell her to get home and keep them all in! We'll be back tonight tomorrow morning the latest. I kiss you all. And stay inside. Damn them... Mr. Shmuel Goldberg, please come to the garage. That's us. -Wanna call home? Later. Let's see how much we're getting. What's going on? Problems? -Hold it. What's going on? Problems? -Hold on? Shmuel, I do not understand... What's going on? -Let me talk to him. What's going on here? I don't know. The exhaust system must be replaced, the tires, the refrigerator everything! They want a German car not American! How much? How much?! 5,000 Euro. That's what we paid the Arab! Maybe we should sell it. No way. He's conning us. I know these guys. Shmuel, 5,000 Euro isn't bad. I am smelling a rat. -This car is worth a fortune. We'll sell it someplace else. Let's get out of here. Where are you going? -I don't know. It's almost dark. Let's find a hotel. 5,000 Euro... It blows my mind. We should've checked with them. I did. -When? I called from home. -What'd they say? They said up to 50,000 Euro for exactly this car. Then where's the 50,000 Euro? 5,000 even? What about our expenses? Listen, I've kept silent up till now. You are the expert but the car is mine too. Let's sell it for what they want to pay and let's go home. Listen to me, Sisso. I am going to sell this car. -To whom? First thing tomorrow we'll go see other car lots. This is unacceptable! You see what kind of hotel this is? I can see that. Saw the number on his arm? Yet, he came back to Germany. I didn't see a number. Yesterday in a palace, today in the gutters... Tomorrow you'll have a sauna massages, treats and 10,000 Euro in your pocket. Trust me. Let's go down and get something to eat. Tomorrow is another day. Do you hear the trains? What are you doing? It's Hanukkah, remember? Today you need 3 candles. Two are enough. "Bless the Lord... "who commands us to light Hanukkah candles "Bless the Lord... "who has sustained us and brought us to this day." "The Lord is my Saviour "Thy praises I'll say "In the house of prayers "Where I shall give my thanks "At the time of victory "Over my enemies..." Tell him it's Hanukkah. What'd he say? He said there's been no God in Germany for 60 years now. Shmuel, there are people in our car! -Which car? Stop! Stop! You son of a bitch! Sisso, come on... Get up! Are you hurt? Where? Does it hurt? -No. Anything wrong? -No, I'm fine. You OK? -I had her in my hands... Motherfuckers... I had her in my hands... Right there in my hands. Sisso, what's the license-plate number? How should I know? It's a huge blue car, American. One of a kind. This big. Almost 8 meters long. You tell him. How much is the insurance. -$3,000 or $4,000. What?! Why so low? I insured it for 3 days. You said it's worth $50,000! What good are your 3 days now? What did he say? -That it'll be OK What'd you think he'd say? Damn it... 80 million people... Go find a car. What will I tell Adina? -That the car got stolen. Stolen! It wasn't our fault. -And Moran? Don't you get it, Sisso? The car was stolen! That's what you tell them. They'll never forgive me. Not Moran, anyway. So, are we going back home? We'll take the train tomorrow. Who's that? What's the police doing here? They found our car. What the fuck! God how they scarred her... I hope they never see the light of day! Look at that...! She's all fucked up! Maniacs! She's ruined! God, what a mess! What's all this? Animals! Everything's still working and in place. A good wash and she's ready. And the scratch? We'll repair it. It's a deep scratch. We don't have the time. It'll take half a day. -Half a day? What are you talking about? And the hotel, food, gas and money? Pnina'll send me some. I've already lost $4,000 on this car. For me it's a lot of money. Look at her. Who'll buy it from you? You have no chance. The biggest car lot offered us 5,000 Euro. Now you'll have to beg for 3,000. You nuts? That policeman was gonna give me 20,000! We're going back to AutoDecker to take what they offer. No more games. I'm not going there! I want this over with, I wanna go. Where? -Home! I've had it! I'm not cut out for this! That's just great! We're begging Germans to buy our car! No one's begging! I didn't sell it to them! I have a family. I want to go home! I'm not cut out for this! I'm out! Take me to the airport. We'll sell her, Sisso. How? In parts? To whom? Who's gonna buy her? Tell me that! This goddamn car has made you crazy! All these trinkets, the bar and the TV! Damn you! I have a family, understand? I have a wife and kids! This mess isn't for me! You want to live here? Well, do it alone. So you're out? -I'm out. Keep in mind you already lost $4,000. Damn the $4,000. I'll earn it with dignity, without crawling. Remember, the car's mine! Let's go. I won't stay here a minute longer. Damn that Arab. He knew what he was doing. OK buddy. You're going to Frankfurt. I need some money. Here. Go on, get lost. Keep your dignity, Shmuel. Hello. Is this a geography lesson? How do I go to Frankfurt? Sisso, this is Shmuel! I'm here at Information. Sisso, this is Shmuel! I have a lion, a giraffe, a monkey and a dog. Giraffe. -The giraffe? 28.30 Euro. It's on sale for Christmas. Would you like it wrapped? -What. Gift-wrapped? Have a nice day? A real limousine... Not bad, eh? Dad, to get to "Auto Fantasi"? d'you turn left or right? First left, second right. Is everything all right? Kurt, bring him a glass of water. Hey, where's Frankfurt? -I've no idea. It's too far, I can't say. What? -Frankfurt. What's wrong? Sir, pulling it is forbidden! I don't believe it! Where did you spring from? -The train. Didn't you go by plane? It was too expensive. Then I saw you from the window. So I got off. What's wrong? She's broken and out of gas. Go check the back. What's that? Someone rammed into me at the airport! Damn them. They hit me good. That's it, Sisso. Our Lincolena's gone. She's staying here. What's with the giraffe? I got it for Shachar. Sisso, promise me something. What? Back home, not a word about this mess. Okay. All my life I've been hearing, "Shmuel, never go there, don't set your foot there, don't touch, don't buy. It's a cursed place, it's Satan, it's the Fire!" Look at me now, I'm 45 and have no child to talk to about this. What are you doing? May this car be an expiation! Shmuel, police! Put it down, police! Is this your car? -What? What does he want? I'm gonna kill him! Stop it! Leave him alone! Shmuel, stop it! You're killing him! Shmuel, there's a car coming! There's a car coming! Get up! Come on, Sisso. Let's go. Central, this is 402. -Go ahead. Send a tow-truck to, road B-8. It's an abandoned car. OK, I'm sending a tow-truck. It's an American stretch limousine, Lincoln Continental, License plates: Quebec, Canada. Color: metallic blue. In 5 minutes. -OK.
