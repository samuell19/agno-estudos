Did you sleep? - Yeah. Some. Barely. - [Woman] Well, why are you up then? - Ask Pandora. - You look terrible, Daddy. - You should know why. (exclaims) - Jesus. (Grisha exclaims) - Good morning, Mr. Isaacs. - I wouldn't say that, Sally. - Why, aren't you feeling well? - I couldn't sleep. I only slept half my sleep. - Have some quiche, Sally. Pandy prepared it. It's just delicious. - Oh, God. - Go back to bed Grisha, they're not coming before one. (Grisha exclaims) - This looks delicious. Who's coming? - My older girl, Betsy, and her fiance. - Is he in the business, her fiance? - [Woman In sweater] No. She's been very mysterious about him. - A civilian? - Yes, but very nice, Betsy says. She's always been kind of a civilian herself at heart. You know, she's never really been one of us. - Really? Coming from this family with both your backgrounds? That's amazing. - Not like our Pandy here. Betsy just never really took to the stage. I tried. God knows we all tried, but one day up in Buffalo, where we were doing "Our Town". I'll never forget it. Betsy was 13. She pointed out from backstage to the audience and said, "I'd rather be out there!" - [Sally] Oh my goodness! What did you do? - Oh, believe me, we tried all sorts of things but nothing worked. Pandy here, six years younger, but raring to go said, "I know her lines, Momma. "Let me do them, please?" And she did, at seven. (squeals) She takes after me. When I was a child, you couldn't even get me off stage. I would just run on in the middle of other's people's scenes and just start improvising. - Where are those damned things? - What in God's name are you looking for? - Ask her. Ask your daughter. She ate my entire box of sleeping cookies. Even the ones I keep hidden upstairs in my script drawer for when the night gets tough. - Oh, George. Have some quiche. Pandy made it. I can't believe a daughter of mine can cook. My mother would die. - It's too fatty. The eggs'll kill me. No, no the Ambien won't work if it's buried in eggs or anything heavy, like that that needs digesting. It's about digestion. - Digestion. - Well, Mr. I, you certainly know what you want. - But I need them to get back for my second four hours after my second Ambien. - I'm sorry, Daddy. I really am. I was kind of sleepwalking. I haven't been able to sleep so well myself in my old bedroom. - Doesn't Ambien take care of that, give you a full night's sleep? - Not the 6.25 time release, only the 12.5. See, that's why I divide the night into two separate sleep sessions. - It's such a dangerous drug. It nearly killed Liza, you know, in the 80's. Mike Nichols lost two years of his life to it. Can't remember a thing from the whole time. He was taking five or six a day, even though it's a sleeping pill. So, God only knows, how many at night. - The 6.25 time release won't work if my belly is still growling. Only the 12.5, but then I'm groggy for most of the day and I want to be clear-headed for that interview I'm doing on that French girl's website. They're doing a two-part piece on me, kind of a retrospective. God, I won't be able to one sentence after another, and there's so much I want to say to them. - It might better if you talked a little less. - But how exciting, a retrospective. If it's anybody deserves it, you do Mr. I. - Aw, thank you, sweetheart. - More to the point, we're having lunch today with our Betsy and her young man. - Oh, God. I'll need to sleep at least another two hours before facing that. - Her what? - Yes, I didn't want to tell you. I didn't want to upset you. Your sister's bringing a man. She says she feels really fertile with. Isn't that something? She thinks she's truly found someone this time. Not that I look old enough to be a grandmother. But, wouldn't it be so sweet? Oh, darling, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! That's why I didn't mention it in advance. - [Sally] Good morning, Larry. - Morning, good morning. - [Sally] Did the trades come? - [George] Damn! - [Larry] What's all the noise about, George? - Oh, my articulate brother-in-law. The noise is I'm starving and I'm unable to go to sleep. - Oh, I was wondering why you were up. Too bad you can't play street. There's two openings in my show. You really don't have to be able to sing for it. - Thanks, Larry, but I'm not interested. I have told you a dozen times, I don't do dinner theater. - He's just trying to help you, Grisha. - I don't need your brother's help, Viv. When I need his help, I'll know I'm through. - I'm sorry, Daddy, I was having a panic attack. I had to eat everything, even vaguely sweet, I could get my hands on. - What are you talking about? Panic attack? Face an audience in Duluth sometime, when every line in Big Daddy's dialogue has flown out of your head. Now, that's a panic attack. I can tell ya. And if I survived that, you can survive breaking up with that bastard. - [Viv] Calm down, George. Go back to bed. - I will get them all back for you by Monday. - Fine. So I won't sleep 'til Monday. I'll be dead by Monday. (scoffs) - I know you're right. I shouldn't have eaten them. I'm sorry. I should be over him, god damn it. - Aw. I believe you may able to go back to sleep now, Grisha. If you don't wake yourself up even more. Now go upstairs, dear. - Good night, Daddy. I'm sorry again. - When are they are coming, for God's sake? - Betsy just said, in time for lunch. Go upstairs. You can get a couple more hours if you don't wake yourself up again now. - Should I take another Ambien? - Yes, but just take a little one. Break off one of the non time release, the little five milligram ones, and take half of that, and carefully put the other part back into the bottle. Okay, but what if it doesn't work? Then do I take the second half Oh, no, oh listen. A daughter of mine marrying a civilian. I still can't believe it! - Just take it and relax. It'll work. I promise you. - Panda tried living with a civilian and look what it got her, nothing but heartbreak. Oh, my poor Pandy. - Daddy, I'm okay. I'm really okay. (door slams) - Doesn't work with civilians. I tried twice. - Yeah, it can start real cute. They give you so much attention, attraction of opposites and all that. They even think you're adorable for a while. You, and your funny ways. - It just doesn't last. You know, there's an actual war between civilians and show folk. If they fall in love with us, eventually they want to kill us. - "Old age is a shipwreck. " You know who said that? - [Larry] Yeah, we know. The French guy. - That's right. DeGaulle. "Old age is a shipwreck." - Too long a pause. George. No, it's better this way. "Old age is a shipwreck." Emphasize the old age. It works much better that way. - [Pandora] Shh! - If you don't. - Acting lessons from Mr. Dinner Theater. It's come to this. I'm going to bed. - [Larry] Yeah. (door slams) - Did Betsy tell you she was serious about this guy? What is he? I mean, what does he do? - Not show biz. That's all she emphasized. A lawyer of some sort. Not entertainment law. I know that. - I bumped into the two of them at Joe Allen's a while back. Nice kid, good looking kid. He picked up the tab for the whole table. - You met him? - Uh huh. - Why didn't you tell me? Why doesn't anybody tell me anything in this family? - I did not think it was important, and besides, you were breaking up with that schmuck. I didn't want to upset you. Come on. Hey. I heard you're getting a doggie. Ruff! Ruff! (laughing) - Would everybody please stop worrying about upsetting me. I don't know. Maybe a dog'll work out better. I've given up on men. - Are you keeping your place in the city, Pandy? - I don't know, I turned down the summer stock thing. It's just depressing living there alone, you know, since he left. But I just couldn't face touring from theater to theater, moving each week with that depressing a couple of white chicks sitting around talking show. I would have hung myself. Do you remember when we were both playing Cincinnati, that week when I was 10? It was the first week Betsy went away to college. It was the longest time I ever saw Grandma Judy, the only time I ever had her all to myself. She gave me something that week, that I have kept ever since, before... (sighs) - Before she left us. I know. What did she give you? You never told me. - A good luck charm, that she said never show it to anyone, or it wouldn't work. So, I never have. - That was magical that last week before she died. I am so glad you had that special time with her. - But what is the point with dogs? Forget it. I'm not getting a stupid dog. There's something so sad about them. These pathetic little creatures, so needy for others' affection, so dependent on others, so out of control of their own little lives. - Darling, are you alright? - Panda is right. Dogs are like little hairy little alien midgets. - Yeah. - Who poop and pee and eat and sleep all the time. Just when you get used to them, they die. (horn honking) - Oh, God. That can't be her. Yes! That's your sister's honk! She's early. Oh, my God whe's so early. - I'm going out. I'm sorry. I'm not ready to deal with my sister yet. - That's okay, sweetheart.

Well, who needs you for an agent, then? Jesus Christ! - Tomorrow we're going to a Seder. I need to know what to wear. That's the most important thing to me right now. 'Cause I have to plan. - Whatever you wanna wear baby. - No, tell me, tell me. - The dress is not important baby. - The end of slavery is important. And I want to dress for it.

They want to make a great impression. - You portrayed them as kind of broken and really in pieces, and they, they seem-- - Do you remember the first time you met me? You had a completely different impression of who I really am. - That's very true. But, I think that I would be able to sense-- - I love that you're trying to be so positive.

We're just getting paid for it. That's the only difference. Didn't Brando say that? - I started out as a writer, but, you know I acted in my plays as well and by the audience response, they told me that's what I should be. - Yeah, what they were telling you is what you should not be is a writer. - My brother-in-law, here, he often comes to me for special material when he's at a loss. - A loss of brain cells.

It's Druid thing. - Mom, please. - Oh, okay. - Oh, forgive me, James. I didn't get much sleep last night. I'm doing this important interview on Skype with Paris, later on, and I was up doing research. They wanted me talk to them about Thomashefsky, you know. - No, I, I don't know. - Saul Thomashefsky, he played third base for the Cards, 1958. - Boris Thomashefsky, the great Yiddish theater actor and producer. Do you know that he came to the U.S. at age 12. And at 13, he started the Yiddish theater, right here, in America, doing Goldfaden's "The Witch", and his wife, Bessie, who acted with him, later on taking the over the female roles from him, was my father's aunt. My grandparents worked with the Thomashefskys quite often. Well, as a matter of fact, he brought them over from Russia. He brought hundreds of actors over when they banned Yiddish theater over there. Do you know he really created it here? He did a version of Hamlet, that he advertised as new and much improved upon. (laughing) - My husband, himself, is from the famous Itzkovich theatrical family. - Oh, please. - [Viv] He is fourth generation Yiddish theater, my Grisha is. They were royalty, his parents and grandparents. I mean really royalty in their day. - Mom, please. (birds chirping) - When I was 12, I became George Isaacs from Grisha Itzkovich in order to cross over on the English-speaking theater. You know, nobody had crossed over before. - Oh, no? How 'bout Manny Goldenberg and Muni Weisenfreund? Huh? - Who? - America's first gangsters. Edward G. Robinson, Paul Muni, original Scarface. They all came from Yiddish theater. - Movie actors. They don't count. No, no, when the Yiddish theater died out, the real actors reemerged on the English speaking stage. You know, the audiences, they just got older and older, and, then they were gone. - [Pandora] I just can't imagine where Panda could be. - Oh, please, it is so like her to do this to me. - Be a little patient with her, okay? - Oh, patient. - Okay, I mean she's had very hard time since she came home. - [Sally] Mr. I, I don't want to miss anything. It's your brother's Passover Seder. Let's go now and Panda can catch up with us. Have you ever been to a Seder, James? - [James] No, I'm half Italian, half Greek. - [Sally] Oh, well this is my first one, too. I'm a Baptist, but I'm looking forward to this. Mr. I's brother, his name is Misha, he presides over this big ceremony and the whole thing. - [Man] I wish you would be a little bit more serious about, this holiday. - Very serious. We just can't help making people laugh. - You have yarmulke hair. - [James] I have yarmulke hair? - You have really intense yarmulke hair. - I'm sorry. Okay. - Come here, come here. - This shouldn't effect the. Okay yeah, oh yeah. - It's a cultural handicap. - I'm sorry, okay. - Okay, everybody pick up your glasses of wine. Don't drink. (speaking in foreign language) This is the bread of affliction, which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. All who are hungry let them come and eat. All who are needy let them come and celebrate this Passover with us. Now we are here. Next year, may we be in the land of Israel. Now we are slaves. Next year, may we be free. The afikoman is safely here. I challenge anyone to try and get it. which, of course, you have to do so that we can complete the meal. Okay. Are you ready to read the four questions? How does this night differ from all the nights? For on other nights, we may eat either leavened bread or unleavened. On this night, not but unleavened. On all other nights, we eat all manner of herbs. On this night those only that are bitter. On all other nights, we do dip that which we eat even once. On this night, twice. On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining. On this night, all recline. - Very good. - Very good. Bravo. Bravo. - For the newcomers here, I want to give a brief explanation what this is all about. This is a national Jewish holiday. This has nothing to do with whether you're religious or whether you're secular like we are. This is a holiday of Jewish liberation. It has been celebrated all the way back to ancient Israel. It embodies the whole concept of our slavery in Egypt, our redemption from the slavery and our celebration thereof. Just as we were slaves, we have to remember how other people are slaves. How we were mistreated, we have to remember not to mistreat anybody else. - [Viv] Right on. - [George] Hear, hear. - Right on. (everyone talking at once) - Alright. We finished with the ceremonies. I know everyone's quite disappointed, but nonetheless, you're all allowed to eat now. - Good! - Oh, good. - We made it out of Egypt. - I'll drink to that. - I didn't think we were gonna make it out of this Seder. - Where the hell is she? - I don't know. But I'm sure she'll be here as soon as she can be. - Well, I hope there's a really good explanation for this. - There will be. There will be. - Is she always late? - (scoffs) She always like to make an entrance. - So, James have you always known what you wanted to do? - Well, I actually wanted to be an astronomer when I was a kid. But somehow I just ended up primarily in real estate. - Oh, God, that's so fascinating. I love the stars. I never miss certain events, and avoid others like the plague based on the positions of the planets. - Mom, he said he studied astronomy, not astrology. - Well, they're very interrelated, darling. - Did you know Vivian, here, was named after Vivian Leigh? - Who? - Oh, my God. - Honey, "Gone with the Wind". She played Scarlett. - Oh, yeah, of course. - Our mother was a lifelong anglophile and she named Larry here after Laurence Olivier, and me after Vivian Leigh. She loved the British theater. And they were the king and queen of it when she was in her prime. - Bessie said that she was half Italian. - I am. We are. - Well, your Uncle Larry and I are darling, on our father's side. You're a quarter Italian, you and Pandora. I am an eighth Chickasaw, you know that's why I can read fortunes. Let me see see your palm, James. - Mom, No! - It's okay, it's okay. - No! No! Don't let her do this. Mom-- - No, come on. - Oh, my God! Oh my God! - What? - Nothing. It's just so intense, I feel a bit faint. Go ahead everyone and let me catch my breath. - Is she alright? - Oh, please. - This is not my side of the family. - She likes to remind everyone. - Always, forever. - Okay. - Hey! Hey, big sis! Oh my gosh! I'm so happy to see you! - Hi! You're James. - Yes. - I'm so sorry I'm so late and such a mess. I'm just, ah, where should sit? Okay, right there. I just saw the most amazing thing. There's this mushy, swampy pond area, where I liked to go as a kid sometimes and just think and stuff. And, anyway, suddenly I hear this really weird sound, you know, like, like wah. Wah. And I look up and I see these two blue bullfrogs and they are making that sound. Bwah, bwah, bwah, bwah. And I realized, oh my God, they're doing it. (laughing) And what do you call it? They're mating. These incredibly blue creatures, just one on top of the other, were mating. And I just couldn't take my eyes off of 'em. I mean it was like creatures from outer space. Just ugly and grotesque, but so lovely. Strangely lovely and moving! - Jesus Christ! That's why you kept us all waiting for you? That's why you missed the first Seder with my fiance? So you could watch bullfrogs screwing each other. It's not funny, Uncle Larry. - It wasn't like that. It was poet-- - Oh, I know, I know. It was poetry. It was art. It was a play. And you were the star. - Betsy, for heaven's sake, calm down. - Panda, you turned 30 last month, ok, not 13. Everyone, excuse me for minute. - Wait a minute, honey. - I, I'm, I've never seen her like this. She's always very composed. I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. - What a bizarre introduction to a Seder this must be to you. I'm sure when you go back and report to people what goes on at a Seder, they'll be quite amazed to hear this. - I'll say it's in a foreign language I didn't know. - [Woman] It is a foreign language you don't know. - This family is a foreign language you don't know. - Oh my goodness. What happened to this? - It's my grandfather's old book. It's from 1922. You see Hebrew and German, but I don't know. The other pages didn't have it. It kinda spoils it. - Somebody must have spilled something on it. - Yeah, I hope it didn't happen now. - You think that could have happened like in the 1920's? - Wait, well you know about dirt. (laughs) - What kind of, is it new or old? - It's some really old stuff. - Oh good. Well, it's not good, but, uh. - Better that it wasn't you. Well that's good. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay everybody. Now we have to conclude. We all have to take the afikoman and each person eat a piece of it. (laughing) All right. - Yay! - Look at whose got it. - I need it now to finish. - No, no, no, no. - No. - What are you gonna give him? - You have to give something. - [Family Head] Give it to me, I need it. - [Woman] No, don't, don't. Offer him something. - Your biggest wish. - No, no. don't overdo it, because you won't get it. In the meantime, please give me back the afikoman. - First, you have to agree to me, in front all these witnesses, so I can aspire to become like, that you will pay for acting lessons. - [Vivian] Yes! Yes! - Oh my gosh, Willie. Not you, too. - Otherwise, we have to sit here and no one gets to eat. - I'll pay for one lesson. - No. - [Vivian] Cheapskate. - You seriously want to pursue that? You see what a bizarre family you have right here? (all laughing) - Sadly, sadly, yes. - And did you see the things going on around here with them? - Sadly, yes. - And that's what you want to be part of? - Sadly yes. - Yes! Yes! - I understood that you wanted. what's it's called? An iPad, an iPad is what you wanted. - Scarface didn't have an iPad. - What? - Yes! - You fuckin' kiddin' me? You fuckin' kiddin' me? - Watch your, watch your language. - Oh, it's lovely. - [George] What's wrong with acting? I don't want to offend you as to what's wrong with it. - [George] Oh, you've always offended me. What else is new. - Just look at the goings on there with your children a while ago. - That happens through all life through, with many families. We're no different than anyone else. - Oh, yes you are. - Oh yes. - Viva la difference. - [George] People expressing themselves. - Viva la difference. - Come on, let's finish up here. - It's settled. It's settled. - God willing. - [Pandora] All right, let's finish the dinner. - [Vivian] Yes! - It's agreed on. - Bravo! - [George] Yes, yes. - By the way, Mom, remind me afterwards, I have to talk to you about something. - Well, darling, always. Whatever but why we don't talk now. - I don't want the whole family to hear. It's just, it's nothing major to worry about. - Judy, I don't think this is the right place to talk about this. - It's fine. - Are you pregnant? - No, Mom, No. - You promise? - I promise. - I can also assure you that she's not pregnant. - You've been practicing safe sex? Is there something I need to know? - No, there's not something you need to know in that realm. - Okay, Mom. Mom, focus on me. - Well, it's been a wonderful Seder. - [Woman] Just incredible in the village. I've only been there a couple times but it's this chocolate bar. - I want you to be able to call your own shots. If you choose to be an actress, you will never call your own shots. - Isn't choosing a profession I want calling my own shot? - And that would be the last shot that you would ever call. - You're picking a profession. - How could-- - My God. - Where you will be over the hill-- - My God. - At 23. - How can you say that for certain? That is not. - Yeah really. - That's such a blanket statement. - You'll be rejected 98% of the time, if you're lucky. Look at your father. - What if I'm willing to be rejected? - What does Dad say? What do you know about it? - You have spent your life having your heart broken-- - I have spent my life - over and over - meeting fascinating people. - and over again. - Okay, guys. - Traveling places I would have never have gone if I sat behind a desk. - But, okay Daddy. - Don't, don't please don't. - This is not about, this is not about the two of you-- - Right, okay. - picking on each other. - We don't, it is, it is-- - Really, it is not about the two of us. - It is not my intention to shred you because of the choices your dad made. - [Man] I once saw a squirrel eat a Flaming Hot Cheeto. - [Girl] Wait, wait, you need to explain this. - Okay. I'm in the park, you know, just chilling, doing my thing. When in walks this squirrel. It goes into this trash can, which I just saw a guy drop a bag of Flaming Hot Cheetos. - Eats the Cheeto, - Hey guys. Backflips onto-- - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? - He's talking about squirrels and Flaming Hot Cheetos. - They go well together. - All right then. - Very entertaining. - How'd it go? - Can I have some? - Yeah. (glasses clinking) - Betsy's upstairs resting. Are you okay? Thank you. - You play well. - I'm very experienced. - I'm sorry about upsetting Betsy. - She'll be fine. - Every since we were little, anything I did upset her so easily. She's six and half years older than me and I always looked up to her but somehow, anything I did, especially around the grownups, anything I said or did just. I used to try so hard to get her to laugh, and then I'd make her smile and then something would happen and she'd get so mad at me. - I am having a hard time imagining a blue bullfrog. - You just don't see that color anywhere, anymore now. You know it's like that blue is gone. Like it only existed in the past. Some big glass balls on Christmas trees, when I was a kid, were that blue color. Or those wonderful old art deco blue mirrors from the 1930's, or out here, when we drive out here from the city to the country, you know, they still had those really, the tall poles with what seemed like enormous, giant blue mirrored balls perched on top of 'em. I don't even know what they were for, but that blue was so perfect and magical, shiny. - I don't know if I've ever seen that color, except in the stained glass windows of the old cathedrals in Europe. You know? - Yes! Yes! The bullfrogs were exactly that color, that exact color of blue and yet the strangest thing they didn't seem that color when they started. Not at first. One was mostly green, and one was mostly yellow. Each one had a distinctive shade of their own, maybe so they could tell themselves apart. I'm not sure, but once they got into it, once she crawled on top of him, and I'm pretty sure it was her on him. - Oh. (Pandora laughs) - Once they started mating, the difference in their colors disappeared and they became one identical, shiny, beautiful deep, deep blue. I'd like to see that. You know that that particular shade of blue that was in those cathedrals, they lost the recipe in the 15th or the 16th century I think, and they can't make it anymore. No matter how hard they try, they can't make it. - You're kidding me? - No, it's true. - You're not making that up? - No, it's one of those weird, obscure facts that just gets stuck in my brain. (chuckles) - Wow. Where'd everyone go? - Too much food. - It doesn't matter if it happened or not. What happens is that this is the Jewish narrative of the liberation of the Jewish people - That's made up according to him. It's all made up. It's not real. - That is not, that is irrelevant. - It never happened. - It is a cultural thing of the Jews. - Yes. - And to show you the force of it, all Jews who are atheists, including us, equally follow it and observe it. - Who says I'm an atheist? - You're getting away from trying to explain to him what it's about. - I thought we said, I thought-- - It's all about liberation. - I thought we said it wasn't about-- - That is what it is about. - I thought we said it wasn't about arguments. - No, but this is Jewish trait. (sighs) - This was Betsy's and my secret hiding space. Well, it wasn't so secret, but we used to put on plays here. I called it the Isaacs' Playhouse. So we'd do "Little Women" or, you know, "Cinderella", and stuff like that. And then she started wanting to play, investment banker and stockbroker. (Pandora laughs) - That's, that's. - [Pandora] I didn't have much to work with that. - Really? - Yeah. - [Pandora] Tell me about yourself. - Okay. - How did you meet my sister? Did she ask you out or did you ask her out? - [James] I asked her out, actually. - Really? - It was me. I initiated it. - [Pandora] What do you talk about at dinner? - [James] What we did that day or-- - [Pandora] About your jobs right? - [James] Yeah. - And that's about money and numbers? - [James] Not necessarily. Not about money so much as putting the right property with the right people. - [Larry] What am I doing with my life? - [Vivian] Oh, darling. - I'm a realist. I look at it. I know what's happened. I go to the theater, and play to a lot of blue hairs, who can't keep their eyes open at matinees. I started out great in television. Frankenheimer, Lumet, all of them before they went out to L.A. and got big and then they never hired me. You remember that. - Yeah. - They never gave me that break. They always thought of me as fine, but limited goods. Oh maybe they thought sometimes great, but never that shot. Meanwhile the guys like DeNiro and Pacino and Dustin Hoffman, they all passed me like I was some putz standing in mud. And I morphed into some character actor. Reliable for small roles. I always felt I should have been somebody. I always felt. I was good enough. - Oh, darling, you're fantastic. It's not about the fame. It's about how true you are to your gut. It's what's inside. You, you change one person's life, my God, you're bigger than all of them. You change the world, when you change one person. You influence one person. It ripples. You throw a little pebble into the water and it goes wah wah wah wah wah wah wah. That's who you are! That's who you are! Don't you ever forget it! - No. - Don't you ever forget it! - (sighs) I miss Mom. - [Vivian] I know. - I miss her so much. I miss her so much. I want her to hold me. - What? - I want her to hold me. - Come here. Come here. There.

Are you alright? - Yeah, I am so sorry. - Oh God I had such a horrible headache. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I came in so late and everything. Can I pour you some wine? - No, Panda. I have a headache. Okay. Sure. I'm really sorry I had that outburst. Okay. - You look gorgeous, big sis. - You, too, little sis. Still filthy, but still gorgeous. - I didn't have a chance to change. - Your sister has been showing me these old videos of her teenage years and they are incredible. She's been telling stories about you. She is crazy about you. - Yeah, yeah right. - She makes me wish I had a sibling. - You don't know what you missed. I loved having a big sister. I loved it more than anything. - You did? My God. There were times I thought you hated me. - What? No, no. I hated that you didn't want to stay in show business, which to me meant you didn't want to stay in our family. I hated that you wanted out, you wanted something else, something separate from us. - That's not entirely true. Remember all those times that I used to take you up into the attic and we played dress up and be all actressy. - We used to go off into the attic and dress up in Grandma Judy's clothes for hours and pretend that we were ladies of the night. - Or two grande dames from Paris. - Yes! - I was the older one who showed her what to do. - Or the best one.

Just something silly we used to do when we were kids. I mean, Panda's right. The audiences, they used to love it. They just went crazy. But well we were little kids and we were really cute. So that's what they responded to. (James moans) (kiss smacks) - We were so cute weren't we? You were my idol. - You know what's funny? I think that's the only time I never threw up before I went on stage, doing that number. God! I can't believe I remember it. - That's cause you had so much fun doing it. - Well, that's cause we did it together. - We had so many games. You taught me so much. It was so magical. And then suddenly, it stopped, overnight it seemed. You left our fantasy world. You left our childhood. You left me behind. - Panda, it was just the age difference between us. It really began to show. That's all it was. You know what I was 16 or 15 years old. You were nine or 10. What do you expect? It's natural. - It wasn't the age difference. It was me, I got on your nerves. You started saying that all the time. That I was getting on your nerves. That you were too old for our games. That I was being silly, annoying, a bother, a pain in the ass. - I never said that. - Yes, you did. Over and over and over and over again. Just like he did, exact same words. It broke my heart. It turned my whole upside down. Just like Andrew did. - Who's Andrew? - He's the boyfriend, who left her. - Just like you did. It felt just like when you left me at 10. - I can't believe that you're doing this. - You know, I heard it said once. I don't know who said it, but, families are like tyrannies run by the sickest member. - Wait a minute. Are you saying that's me? (Pandora laughs) - No. It just came into my head, that's all. - I like that. I like that. Tyrannies run by its sickest member. - Yeah. Well, in this family, that could be anyone. Or everyone. Definitely you. - Bite me. Let's have fun. Let's, let's play a game. What's your favorite game? How much is this house? Remember how used to go on, we used to go on road trips and we'd play how much is that house? And then she'd point to a house and I had to guess how much it would go for on real estate and I always, you know, I was like five dollars, I don't know. and she would, she would hit, punch me every time. You'd punch me. That was the rules. Every time I got the price wrong, she'd punch me. - How much do you think this house is worth? - I don't know. I'm sure it's pretty good. How much is it worth? I don't know. - A lot. - Like how much though? I was wondering about that. How much are Mom and Dad actually sitting on here? - I think you should dance again. (laughing) That's a way better game than price this house. - Skype. I still cannot believe it. They just give me 15 minutes. After all that preparation. There was so much I wanted to say to them, and they just didn't ask me about any of it. 15 minutes for a lifetime. - I know. I'm sorry. - Come to bed. - And, and then they abruptly cut me off because Julia Louis-Dreyfus had just phoned and they're doing reruns of Seinfeld on French TV so would I (speaking in foreign language) sum it up in two minutes. A lifetime. - I'm sorry, George. - What the hell does Seinfeld have to do with Yiddish theater? Jesus! - I know, Grisha, I know. - I can't find any of my things. Where are those files that didn't fit into the filing cabinets? Who moved them? - He's a nice man. Very charming, good looking. I've always been a sucker for those dark, moody looks. - Who moved them? - I did. You know I had to turn your little library into a place where Betsy and her young man could sleep. You had stuff all over the couch, which needs to fold out into a bed for them. It's so crowded for them as it is, it's embarrassing, but with her room rented out to Sally, the guest room with Larry in it, there was no other way. - But my files and stuff. I was organizing them all for my book. - Now Grisha, you know you've been organizing them all for years now. - But where are they all? I need know where they are. - Don't worry. I very carefully moved them all up into the attic. It'll just be for weekend, then you can take them all back down again if you insist. - If I insist? I have so many things up there. Most of them are the only copies. I knew were everything was. Oh, Jesus, Viv. - Aw. Things come, things go. It's people, Grisha, they're the only things that are real. - People come and go, too. All you can count on are your things. I've learned that, if nothing else. - But for what? For whom? - Oh, I don't know. For the kids. For their kids, if they ever have any. For the public, I guess, so they'll know. - [Vivian] For heaven's sake, know what? - That we were here. That we were, that we existed, that without us, there would be no them. - [Vivian] You are getting a bit depressing, dear. - I know, I know. (chuckles) It's just no sleep. I can beat anything but no sleep. - [Betsy] Ah, they're exhausting. - [James] You know, they're kind of like out of a play or something. You know? - [Betsy] Yes, I do. I love your family. So calm, so safe. - Yeah, sure. Nobody ever says anything. - What a relief that must be. - [James] You know, I don't think your family seems so-- - Believe me. I know. When you first meet them, they can fool you, but that's their job. They're actors. It's their job to fool you. - [Pandora] Who can fool who? - Nothing. - This is so weird, you know? - What? - This whole thing. You two getting engaged. It's the 21st century. What is the point of getting engaged? Why not just get married? I mean engaged? - I know what you're talking about. - What? You do? I don't. - You know what she means. - James, what do you mean, that you know what she means? You think getting engaged is too what? Old-fashioned? Comic? - Well yeah. No, not comic, but old fashioned. Yeah, I mean, I don't mind because it was important to you to do it, but why not just get married? - Yeah. - You, stay out of this. James, I don't find this funny. Not even a little bit? - A sense of humor about herself has never been my sister's strong point. - Are you even working now? - No. I'm at liberty right now. Actually, I like being unemployed for a change. - You see, how crazy is that? She's 30 and she likes being unemployed. - It's like breathing. It's just like taking a deep breath. That's all. - Okay. - I understand that. I haven't taken a breath in years. - You're just playing up to my sister, aren't you? Everyone always plays up to Panda. - They do? That's news to me. - What? - Shut up, Pandy - Pan-dee! - James, I don't find this funny. Do you agree with my sister or do you agree with me? It's as simple as that. It always come down to that, doesn't it? It always has. You're an actor. Like Mom and Dad, and you know what? You all live in a fantasy world. And I have to be the grown-up. The responsible one, the serious one. The one who invests all your money, who makes sure that you and they don't blow every penny you make and then can't figure out what happened to it all. - Betsy, lighten up. I was only agreeing with the concept of engagement being a bit archaic, especially considering the fact you and I have been living together for six months. - What? You have? Six months? Wow. That's weird. Betsy always used to tell me everything. We confided so much all our lives with each other. - Really? She told me you two have been estranged for years. - Estranged? - No, I never said years. I never said-- - We've been estranged for years? Betsy, I don't-- - Panda, I'm sorry. I can't go into it now, okay? I'll explain this to you later. James, I'm really tired. Can we go to bed now, please? - I'd like to understand what's going on here. - Yeah, me too. - I knew it. I knew the two of you would gang up on me. Do you know how I have been dreading this moment? - You have? - What? What's gotten into you? Why are you so different here? - I know what's happening here. Don't think I don't know what's happening? I'm going to bed. Good night. - What? - Go after her, James. - It's Jimmy. - Well, she calls you James. - I know. - Well, go after her, Jimmy. - I don't. I don't understand this. - There's nothing to understand. Just go after her. Go after her. No. It's this house. It makes everybody crazy. She's a, she's a great girl. - Yes, she is. - A really great girl. - Uh huh. - Then go after her, please. Every girl has a right to feel exhausted once in a while. To react crazy when she's suddenly thrown back into the midst of insanity of her crazy family and what the guy has to do is just understand that. Understand that. And go after her. - [Betsy] What are you doing? - Hey. I'm looking at these photo albums. It's incredible. Got a question for you. Who's Lil Dagava or Lil Dagover. There's like so many of her autographs. Someone loved her. - I don't know. It's probably some old actress that my parents love. I think my parents have more pictures of complete strangers in their photo albums, than they do of their own children. Well, at least of me. - I should ask your parents about this because, there are like hundreds and hundreds of kinda interesting looking people. - I've never seen you fascinated before. - Wow. Wow. It's just they're so elegant. - Put that stuff away, come on. Get in bed. - Really? - You haven't even touched me since we've been here. - Well, you go from headache to headache.

That mattress is over 100 years old. I can't wait to get back home to our Tempur-Pedic. - [Pandora] Hey, guys. Did you sleep well? Oh! - Can you believe we slept very well. - I made waffles and the raspberries are fresh! They're not very big. Momma grows them herself, but they are fresh and they taste like real raspberries taste. When was the last time you tasted real raspberry, meaning like you picked it off the vine, in Vermont or something? - Oh god, since when did she become Suzy Homemaker? God, help us all. - I always want spring to just go on forever, you know? - What's your Mom doing? - [Betsy] Oh, my God. - Astromancy is what it's formally called. - What's that? - Divination by the study of the winds and the cloud shapes. She's a great believer in that. - Jesus, she's still at that? - Yeah, why? - Thank you. - Why not? It helps her feel in touch with the forces of nature. She loves it. - Do you see? It used to embarrass me so much when I was a kid, all this stuff that she-- Oh, God, it'll never end. - Well, everything embarrassed you, Betsy-wetsy. - Everything you did, that's for sure, Andy- Pandy. - [Pandora] Ow! Stop it! - Good morning, sir. How did you sleep? - Ah, the Ambien hasn't all shaken off yet, but it sure worked this time. - Ah, good. - Six solid hours. - Daddy. You look better. - Ah. - Do you, you live here, as well? - Yeah, for about half a year. It's become a challenging time for character actors these days. - Oh, well we just share chores, that's all. We love having her here. Sally is a whiz in the kitchen. It all works out. She's family. - [Pandora] Betsy, can I talk to you for a second? We'll be right back. - [Betsy] I can't believe this. - You can't tell anybody this, okay? I just thought I was sharing something fun with you, you know. It's like when we were kids. - Yeah, this, this is really fun, Panda. You shouldn't have shared this with me. Why did you share this with me? I don't want to know this. - Why not? Why can't we just share a secret? - Because you need to share the secret because you need to get it out and you know it's gonna upset me but you don't care, because you need to share the secret and get it off your chest. - Well-- - And now I'm the one who's all fucked up from it, and I just wish you wouldn't have told me. - This isn't about you. This is about us. It's about us sharing something. It's about us being sisters. - I know, I'm just, I'm, I'm shocked. - You two must have played every city in the Northeast and the Midwest that anyone has ever even heard of. - You can say that again. They were known then as the incredible Isaacs. They would set up stage in one town so fast beyond that night, it seemed like they were in two places at once. (laughing) - Then the kids joined them after a few years. - Aw. - Oh God, those were fabulous years. - Yes. You touring in one show, us in another. Sometimes we'd almost collide. You know we did six shows a week, and by the time we knew our lines and our moves, we were onto the next show. I don't know how we did it. - As I was looking through that stuff, now when you were a boy, there were those articles from the 1940's, what, what language was that? - Oh! - [Both] Yiddish. - Yiddish, Yiddish. - Before my time. - Oh yeah, of course, Yiddish, Yiddish, yes. - Well, I mean I could never read them. So when we met, George translated them for me or said he did. I never knew if he were exaggerating giving himself rave reviews. - Oh come on. - Go to any a translator. They'll tell you the reviews were great. - He was like a child star. - [George] You're damn right, tell him. - Yeah, he was. - Or a star, not a child star, a star. - Hold up, so sorry! - [George] Okay. - He was a star in that world. Something, I never got to be, a star. - [Pandora] Uncle Larry, let's get you down to lunch and get you made up. - Benny Southstreet. - What do you want to know? Who I'm playing? - Yeah. - [Pandora] Larry's the role of Benny Southstreet. - Benny Southstreet. It's a great part, great, great, great part. It's great to do a play so close to the house. We don't have to rush, I do my makeup right here. - Which one's Benny Southstreet? - Oh it's, it's a pivotal great, great role. The play sort of revolves around him, you know. (laughing) - Shh! - Sorry. - There are actors who know how to make a play revolve around them. Who give a part more substance, make it more memorable. There are actors who know that, and there are some who seem to forget. Though Stanislavski said, "There are no small parts, only small penises." - Oh, come on. What's wrong, Grisha? - The Ambien hasn't quite worn off yet. - But Daddy. - What? - You're still addicted to that stuff? It's not good for you. - [George] I'm not addicted. - Well, are you still taking it every night? - Yes, but only the prescribed amount by Dr. Mulebower, so I can sleep. He says it's important I get a good night's sleep. - So you're addicted. - What, what's addicted? - It's when you can't sleep without it. - Well, why would I want to sleep without it? (sighs) - The rules according to Betsy. No Ambien. - [Larry] No, no, no. She's not always wrong. Come on, she's just. - No theater! - She's making-- - No Ambien, no theater. You put the two together? He has a problem. - Girls, girls, girls. - [Betsy] And where are the two of you in this? - [Vivian] What were we talking about? - Where are the two of you in this, just what? - What were we talking about? - Oh, it doesn't have anything to do with you, so it doesn't-- - Betsy was talking about rules. - Endowments. - And how great rules are and how we should love rules. Especially her rules. - They're rules, huh? - I don't know. I think that rules are there to help us feel safe. I know that there've been times in my life when I was protected by rules. - Sane. To keep people sane. Of course rules are important. They're vitally important. Border, structure, clarity. I mean think about it. Without rules, really think about it. No rules. There'd be chaos. - Well, I think that you, you theater people seem to, you're very free. - Free? - Kind of rule-less. It's kind of nice. - [Betsy] What are you doing? - I-- - Remove your mouth from their asses. - Whoa! - Oh darling! (laughs) - I'm just agreeing with what they're saying. I don't know. You're not constrained-- - Thank you. - and that's, it's refreshing. - You know what? I like this man. I like this man! - Refreshing? - Yeah. - You call this refreshing? - Yes, I would. - Everybody running around, emotionally naked. You try living with that as a child, okay? You try not knowing what to do, because everyone, everywhere, was doing everything all the time. And, I can tell you from a kid's perspective, not all kids, obviously, but from my kid perspective, it was terrifying. It was horrible. It was not refreshing. - My sister's right. We are kind of freaks. We are clowns, we are jesters. For a society that needs to laugh, but is afraid to on its own. That's why, that's why civilians don't like us. They can't live with us. They just like to be amused and entertained by our antics. We're all one big funny Steve Martin, wild and crazy guy to them or better yet, Jerry Lewis' nutty professor. - You know, all I wanted was us to be normal. - Oh, God, honey. - Well, I tried that for six boring, uptight, "Watch what you say", "Don't do that", "Touch it" and "Sit on it". "They won't like it, "they won't like you "if you do that" years! But behind it all was "You'll never join their little club", "You'll never really get their approval "'cause you have been contaminated by the theater." By a freedom to let your emotions show, no matter how unattractive they may be. But I learned my lesson. I learned it over and over and over and over and over again. I learned the more you show of yourself, of who you really are, the more they will be terrified. and they'll run. - So you two broke up? That's why you're back here. - Yeah, well, I mean he broke up. I just, I got broken. - (sighs) Panda, I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me? You could have called me. - I knew that you would disapprove. You said that he was a real person with a real job, and you said how great he was for me. - [Betsy] I think he was. I thought you needed that stability in your life, Panda. And I still think you do. - Well, I can't do that anymore, Betsy, and good for you, if you can. Good for both of you. I am such a failure. - Panda. Panda! - [Betsy And Larry] Panda! - Failure? Who's a failure, huh? I tried a straight job for six years, high-paying advertising job that I gave up to do what I love. Sometimes, I get the parts I want, but mostly I don't. I know people in straight jobs they can't stand, or in marriages and relationships that they hate, and they think of their lifestyles as false and fake to them. I'm a success because I have done with my life what I love. - Darling, are you alright? - No! I gotta do so. - James, I'm so sorry about all of this. This is what I warned you about. - Larry, Larry, can I see you a minute? - Yeah, baby, but I got a show to do. - I feel so ashamed! - Ashamed? What would a sweetheart girl like you ever have to be ashamed of? - Well, I'm afraid I've eaten some of those cookies Panda's gettin' all the blame for. Sometimes, I can't control myself and I sneak off with one or two and take 'em to my bed. - Oh well, that's not what you should be taking to bed baby. - It's worse than that, Larry. I've taken some of those terrible Ambien pills of his, as well. Just tiny pieces, but I feel so bad. And you know, late at night I just think about things too much and then I go looking for some of those pills. You won't tell on me, will you? - No, no, no, no, never tell on you. I'll cover for you. - Loose lips sink ships. - Oh boop, boop bah. - We've always encouraged the girls to be very outspoken ever since they were little. But they've taken it in very different directions. - You gave us no boundaries, Mom. You and Dad were so, "do your own thing" that I had no idea what was okay and what wasn't. It's driven me crazy my whole life. That's why James was such a relief for me. So steady and stable after a whole lifetime of chaos. - Chaos? What a minute. What are you saying? That somehow all this is our fault? - Mom, can we please not do this anymore in front of an outsider? - Wha? Excuse me? That's how you see me? As an outsider? - That's not what I meant. What I meant is that everyone in this family is so crazy. Everyone is so dramatic that, that someone as normal and healthy and focused as you couldn't possibly expect you to keep up with all the craziness. - Hi, Daddy. You still have one kid left. Betsy's normal. I'm the factory reject, but at least you know, Betsy's got a life. She's got a job and now she's got her fiance. - Your mother and I led selfish lives like our parents. That's all we knew. Nobody talked to us about raising kids. Kids just happened. We were actors. We, we had to survive. We had to take whatever job we could, and we were luckier than most. I can't tell you how many times your Mom cried before going on stage when she knew you were with Grandma Judy or a friend or a babysitter. It killed us. That's why as soon as you were old enough we had you performing on stage, to be close to us. We had no idea how all of this would affect you. - Daddy, you don't have to apologize. You and Mom took everything that you were and embraced it. You know what that gave us as kids? That's why I'm home, because I'm safe here. I don't feel safe anywhere else, except on stage, maybe. But I didn't even feel safe going on that summer stock thing. I just. I don't know where to go. Daddy, I don't where know where to go. - One thing I can tell you. Nothing stays the same. Good or bad. It changes. - It gets worse. - No. - And worse. - It might get worse, but you're supposed to just live your life. Just live your life, fully. Grasp it, hold on to it and live it, and you'll learn from the pain. - Daddy, every man can't stand being with me. - Can't you understand that those men may not be worth your time? Can't you understand that? - Every single ex-boyfriend of mine, I get the message now. I get that I can't exist in a relationship. I can't co- exist. - What are you looking, what are you looking for in a man? - If they can cook, that's pretty good. - No, no, no. You want want them to be authentic. You want them to be real. - I wouldn't trade my childhood for anything. I wouldn't trade you and Mom. - Well, then don't trade your adult life for anything. Just live it. And if you get rejected, you get rejected. You're an actress, you should know that our lives are full of rejection for God's sake. Just accept the rejection, and go on from there. ♪ Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah ♪ ♪ Zip-A-Dee-A ♪ ♪ My oh my what a wonderful day ♪ ♪ Plenty of sunshine, heading my way ♪ ♪ Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, Zip-A-Dee-A ♪ ♪ Mister bluebird's on my shoulder ♪ ♪ It's the truth, it's actual ♪ ♪ Everything is satisfactual ♪ - Hi. - Hello.

That's probably true. - So what do you think? I don't like exposing myself too much, maybe. I like to think it through first before I put my foot in my mouth, you know. - So what do you feel? - I don't know. You're a funny family. - I can't keep giving you things. Besides that.

O-O-R-T. It's this gigantic reservoir of frozen objects, ice dwarfs, cometary nuclei that surrounds the solar system. And, every once in while, for no predictable reason or plan, some gravitational influence like a galactic bulge in the Milky Way or a passing star or a molecular cloud perturbs an object sending it in to the inner solar system where it becomes a comet and then either it burns up on the way to the sun or gets flung out into the far reaches of space or crashes violently into a planet. - So each one of us is like a comet breaking off? - You sure are. - Well, thank you, I guess. I'll take that as a compliment. - What? That sounds terrifying and unpredictable. How can you really like that? - I don't know. I guess maybe it feels like home when there's no place else to go. - Oh, and where's little dog, Toto? - Betsy, stop being such a bitch. Oh, my God. Pandy! Where are you going with this? - That's just it, Mom! I wasn't going anywhere! - What? - Don't you see there's no place for me to go, and that's why I'm home. That's why at 30, I've come home, 'cause I get it why I can't live out there in in their world out there unless I'm willing not to be me. And, if I insist on being me. whatever that is, if I let anybody in to see how crazy and out of my mind I really can be, they will leave. - Stop it, psycho. - It's that simple. They'll leave like Andrew did, like John did. Being real, it seems, is the final deal breaker. - Pandy! Pandy! Sweet little Pandy! Stop it! - Oh, come on! Stop it! - Stop it! My God! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry to do this in front of you, Betsy. I'm sorry to do this in front of James. I am sorry to be the asshole again. - No, you're not. - Well, it's fine. - She's not sorry to do this in front of you. My, God. She loves having an audience for her drama. This is what she lives for. This is what she's always loved. My, God, Panda. It just never ends with you, does it? - [George] Betsy. - You know someone once said, "Life is as comedy to those who think "and a tragedy to those whose feel". Or is it the other way around? - James, we have to tell them now. - Oh, I don't think now is a good time. - Tell them, James. - They're very vulnerable. - It's now or never, James. - What are you talking about? - Mom, Dad. James has something to tell you. - Wow. - James. Well, um, well, about a week ago, um. Betsy and and I, we, we came up with a solution to your problem. And it's, uh you know what she told me and what it, it-- - James, just spit out. Mom, Dad. We have put together a terrific solution that will make everyone very happy. - Solution? Solution to what? - [Vivian] What? - A solution to your problem. - What problem? We don't have any problem. - Daddy you know, for months now, we've been talking about this on the phone, on e-mail. - [Vivian] What in God's name are you talking about? - The economy, jobs falling apart. Theaters closing. You guys having to cut corners, and you're not getting any calls for work. - Oh, God. - So, hard times. Just hard times. We've had hard times before. We've muddled through. We always have. Just a little belt tightening. Mwah. - Daddy, you're getting old. I'm sorry, but it's the truth, and this house, look at this house. It's decrepit. It's falling apart. You can't afford to do any of the repairs. And, Mom you have to take care of Dad and Uncle Larry and everybody, everything. You even have to take in a boarder to make ends meet. You know how that makes me feel? I just, it makes me sad. I can't take it anymore. - I wasn't complaining about-- - [Betsy] Yes, you were. - All right, maybe I was complaining a bit, but it's no big deal. I threw the I Ching just three days ago and it said that the path would become clear when the leaves turn, which must mean this autumn. - Geez, do you see this? They need our help. - What? - Mom. Panda can't take care of you. And I'm gonna be traveling all over the country with the company, and you and Dad, you're gonna stuck here all alone, running this crumbling ruin. Now, I want you to be safe in a place where you'll be protected. A community of retired theater folk who enjoy each other-- - Oh my. - Who have full lives. - Betsy, Jesus Christ. - Retire? Wait a minute, wait a minute! I beg your pardon! Just because work has been a little hard to come by and I haven't wanted to, to leave your father. - Exactly. You haven't wanted to leave Daddy. James, will you please explain this to them? Help me out here. I can't do this alone anymore. - Okay, Betsy. Betsy found this charming, retired actors community, in New Jersey. It's near the shore, and actually, she filled out an application for the two of you, and it was accepted, and we have found a buyer, even in this tremendously depressed market for your, charming yet, slightly rundown home, and the money from it will allow the two of you to live in this new community for the rest of your lives and, this is, this is very nice, this place. I must say, but. - You shit! - I knew she'd do this. I told you not to do this in front of her. - What are talking about? - How could you do this to them? - Listen, I swear I didn't know. I didn't know them. I didn't understand. They were just abstractions to me, and their daughter, your sister, told me this is what they wanted. I thought I was helping. - Well, now you see what they want. Who they really are. I know you see it. What are you going to do about it? (Vivian sobs) - Mom, please calm down. Dad, I need you to sign this. James, what are doing? What are, what are you doing? - I'm very sorry. I didn't understand, all right? I'm very sorry, sir. I did not know. - I'm in shock. I'm really in shock, Betsy. You're like the bad seed, or something. - You said they were fragile. They needed our help. They couldn't take care of themselves. - It's true. It's true. But they are actors. And, James they're acting like they're fine. But you don't see them when no one else is around. You don't see the real them! You're falling for their act. You fell for her act. You're falling for their act. Just like every other idiot in the audience of their God damned life. (slap cracks) God damned it, Mom! I'm not a child anymore! Don't you hit me! I'll fucking hit you! - Stop it! - Stop it! - Just stop it! Now, Christ. - My forgiveness teacher says, "It's only ourselves that we're really angry at", but I'd swear it was you and not me, Betsy, who's really pissing me off! What was your commission going to be for helping us this way? - Where are my nitroglycerine tablets? - [Betsy] This is not about that, Mom. This is not why I did this. - I don't know. - What's going on here, Betsy? - Count to 10. - Oh, my God! Grisha! 10. - 10. - Nine. - Nine. - [Family] Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. - Oh God, James, they're doing it. - Doing what? - One. - They're acting. They're, you don't know who you're dealing with, do you? They're not this perfect couple, that they are acting for you now. - 10. - [Both] Nine, eight, seven, six. - You wanna know what Panda told me? you know what Panda found in the attic last night? Love letters written to my father from a woman he was sleeping with for years! - [Pandora And Vivian] Betsy! - You snuck into our trunk? I moved stuff to make room for you two in Dad's sitting room, but you know that truck in the attic is our private property and not to be touched! That the attic is off limits! And all your father's scrapbooks and press things. That hasn't changed since your childhood. How could you violate us like that? - I didn't. Panda did. She's the one who found the letters and she told me about them. - Betsy, what are you doing? - Pandora? - I was just looking for cookies. I'm sorry I snooped. I am sorry I told Betsy. It was for a moment, like we were kids again and she was my big sister and we were just giggling and gossiping, but I am so sorry that I read them. - Tell them, Viv. - I'm gonna just go upstairs. - It's time you told them. - No. Jimmy, that's okay. Please stay. You're going to be part of this family. - I'm so sorry, Momma. I'm so sorry. - Tell them Viv. They're big girls now. They're grown women. - Do you think they can handle it? - Wait a minute, you know about this? - They're our kids. They love you, Viv. It's time they knew about life. Real life. - Momma, what is it? - I guess I should tell you about it. - [Pandora] You should tell us about it? - No, I don't want to know. I don't want to know. I'm going upstairs. - No, no, Betsy. You stay here and you listen to your mother. Would you like a drink, James. - Yes. Yes, I would. - You girls don't think I had affairs. My, God, in a lifetime, who doesn't have affairs? Does that mean that you don't love your husband or that he doesn't love you? Not necessarily at all. Those letters were written to me. - To you? - That's right to me. - But wait a minute, Panda said that they were from a woman. - Yeah. - Right? - Yeah. Every one she started with, "My darling", and was signed, "Your loving girl". - They were from a woman, they were. They were written to me. Women can write love letters to women, too, you know. It's nothing new, baby. - [Betsy] They were to you. From a woman. (laughs) - Was she nice, Momma? - She was lovely. - [Pandora] Aw. - Your father was, shall we say, a bit busy at the time with a woman of his own I might add, just to keep the record straight. - [Betsy] Jesus Christ. - Oh, Viv, that was less than a summer. Yours was over two years. - You were so sweet to me that that second summer. It broke my heart. Oh my God, you knew? - Of course I knew. ♪ She may get weary ♪ ♪ Women do get weary ♪ ♪ Wearing that same shabby dress ♪ ♪ But when she's weary try a little tenderness ♪ - Oh, God. You are so corny. You were always so unbelievably corny. I just couldn't resist it. Oh my god, I'm gonna throw up. - I love you, Daddy! - I love them both. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. - What do you mean? You do? This is sick! Oh, God. You are so weird! I'm just gonna go throw up! God, you both make me sick! Ugh. I wanna go. James, I want to go. I want to get in the car and I want to get our stuff and go back to the city. - I'd like to tell you all something. It's something I've never, told anyone, ever. I never really felt comfortable. But, I think I'm gonna tell you all now. - Oh, my God. Oh, I can't take another thing, please, God. Not another thing. - When I was 15 I was the, one of the best swimmers on my high school team. And I was the best diver. And one day, at a practice before this big meet at the city pool, I dove off the highest diving board I've ever seen in my life. It was twice the height of the one at school. They used it for, like, practicing for the Olympics or something. And it was off limits to us kids, so of course, I dove off it. (chuckles) When I hit the water, it was like cement. And it knocked me out. I found out later that I was underwater for about two minutes before they were able to pick me up. And I'd suffered severe hypoxia, which is lack of oxygen to the brain and the central nervous system. And they weren't sure that I would ever recover, and there was a good chance that I was gonna be paralyzed in some way. - What? - It took me a long time to recover, physically, and during that time, my mother and my father and I were told by this major neurologist, with 100% certainty that no matter how much I improved physically, I would never develop beyond the level of a 10 year old. He said that I should be happy that I was alive, and that I was unbelievably lucky, given what I'd gone through, that I was able to walk and talk. And I sunk into a deep depression. I just didn't do anything. I stayed in the house. I didn't go to school. I didn't see anyone. And, if anyone ever did visit, I started doing this, this thing. I was hiding. So that no one would see how limited I was. How pathetic. How stupid. And I got very good at hiding. - My God, James. I'm your fiance. How could you have never told me this? - Well, I didn't feel comfortable enough, I guess, Betsy. I'm sorry, but I do now. I do here, with you. - [Vivian] Ah, poor, poor kid. - What a great character to play. No, no, no disrespect intended. - No, none taken. - Why now? Why here, in front of everyone? - I don't know. I feel safe here. - Here? - Wait, I don't understand. What happened to the injury? - So I decided that I would fake it. Maybe the doctors were right but I would cover it. I would hide it. I would pretend to be normal. I would act like a grown-up. - My, God! It was an acting job! - Terrific part for a juvenile! (Vivian laughs) Yes, you know, I didn't realize at the time. But, that's right. It was acting. - And, of course, if you could act like a grown-up-- - Exactly! The diagnosis was wrong. Now it took me a while to realize that, but eight years later, I graduated Rutgers, summa cum laude, only two years later than my original class. - Oh, my. - How great is that? - Fabulous! - Oh good for you, kid. - But wait, James. Wait! How do you know that they weren't right? - Huh, Betsy look at me. Jesus, you know me. - Looks can so deceiving. If you haven't been tested-- - Oh, my God. - Shut up. - I've always been afraid to talk about it. - My God. You were so strong. He was so in control before he came here! - I still am so strong, Betsy. But I am strong because I know how weak I was, how weak we all are. How human it is to be weak, to be afraid, to feel hopeless, and how not to be afraid to feel those things. - Oh God, that is true strength. What is the name of that play? - [George] Well, it sounds like it's from Odette's. - No, no, what am I thinking of? O'Neal. O'Neal. - No, it's not O'Neal. - [Betsy] Stop it! - [George] Not at all. - Shut up! Shut up! God, it just never ends! This is not about you! I knew, I knew that coming here would just fuck it all up! I knew it! I knew it. - Fuck it all up? - Why, why fuck it up, Betsy? Jimmy just told you the most amazing, wonderful thing. - Sure to you. To all of you. who love your vulnerabilities. Who indulge your weaknesses. Who applaud yourself and, and look for audience applause for your quirks, and weirdnesses, and your failures and your flaws! It's bullshit! That's what it is. It's bullshit. I will not be part of this. I have run away from it my entire life. And I thought that James, I thought that you (growls) God, I just, I can't take this anymore. - Betsy. - Betsy. Do you really love him? I mean, really? - Why, what's it to you? Right. - Do you? - I had six wonderful years before you were born. I was happy. I was joyous. And Mom and Dad were over the moon about me. And then you came. God it all changed. You were so cute. So talented. So seductive. You played up to all the adults. Oh, they just cooed over you, and slowly I just became serious, bookish Betsy, as opposed to happy, playful Panda. - I'm sorry. - It's too late. - Do you love him? - What I loved. Well, what I thought I loved was his normalcy, you know. His not-like-us-ness, but I think what I really loved was, in some weird way, he reminded me of growing up with all of you, and I missed you. God, I have missed my family so much. I have been so angry at you all for so long. You know, I stayed away from here as long as I could but, I think I was pulled toward him because I knew underneath he was like all of you, and, I missed you but God, Panda, I just can't stand being with you. - It's not too late. He's in there. Go to him. - Panda. You don't understand, I don't want that. That's the point. I love you all, I do. But God, you make me crazy. And, I just, I cannot have this kind of up and down, seesaw kind of life anymore. I can't. I need stability, sanity, normalcy. - Betsy, nobody is normal. - The audience is.

Fewer people in the audience than on stage. - God, that's awful. - Oh, Larry. - There were less paying customers than actors. Well, it's in our contract. We don't do the play if there are fewer people in the audience than on stage. - Oh, I've been there, Larry. I am so sorry. - [Vivian] Where's Betsy? - Oh, she just drove out of here like a bat outta hell! What is going on here? - She took my car? - Betsy, so angry. Always. Always was an angry little girl. I wish I could do something for her. I'd give anything to know what to do for her. - There's nothing more we can for her, Grisha. Everyone's got to live their own lives. We have to let them do that, and they are old enough to let us live our lives. - Life, no big deal. You cry a little. You laugh a little. You go by the script. Then the big guy comes out from the wings and gives you the hook. - She's gone. She's gone. She took my car. (Larry laughs) - Come on. I'll, drive you back to the city-- - No, no. - and we'll find her. Let's go! - No. I'd rather, I'd rather stay here, with you, if that's alright. We can worry about the car tomorrow. I'll stay here, if that's okay? - Jesus, what great material! I want to play you, George. - [George] What? - I want to play you. - In what? - In this! - Well I don't want to play you. - I get it, and I want to play Momma, but Uncle Larry is too old to play opposite me. (laughing) - I beg your pardon. - Well, what about me? - I've got it. We'll make it a memory play. - Hey, that's a great idea. - Past and present. - Yes! - I'll play you, in the present, remembering it all. - Well, why should you play me? Why can't I play me? - You're too old for the part. - Oh, thanks a lot. - And besides, I look a lot younger than my age. - [George] Oh, really? - And I play Momma then, having a secret love. - And I play her secret love. Which is only fair, after all. - Who comes back to visit all these years later. - Whoa! Whoa! - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have blurted that out. - Oh, that's alright, Sally. Pandy will understand. - Sally? - We're just friends now, darling. It was a long time ago. - Well, as long as we keep in the family. - Just don't don't tell your sister. She'd have a heart attack. (bright music) - I love my sister. - I know, I do, too. I just can't be with her anymore. - You can't? - No. You know that. - No, you have to. You don't understand. She's the most fragile one of us all, you know? - Well, I think we all are in some way. - No, no, not me. Not in truth, I'm not. I act fragile and vulnerable, but it's all an act, you know? You were so open about yourself, I just have to be completely honest with you, too. I don't want you to buy my act. - Okay, go ahead. - With Betsy, it's real. What you see is what you get. Not me. I see everything as a scene in a play, so even during the most upsetting event possible, like back there with Betsy, I am just saying my lines. I am playing a part and I see the other person as playing their part, so I know, at the deepest level, no matter how devastating or painful that moment is, there will be an intermission. I can't tell the difference between life and art, and I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. - That is such incredible bullshit. You just show on the outside, what I have on the inside, what I think everybody does. - What am I supposed to do with you? - Well, I think you're gonna have to show me the blue bullfrogs mating. That's mine. - Yeah? - Where did you get that? - Upstairs in your Dad's trunk with all the press clippings. - Wah. - Wah. (Pandora giggles) Wah. - Wah. - [George] That's the last scene? - Shh. For now. Look up there. Oh, my God. Look up there. Those two cloud shapes right up there. - Oh, not now, darling. - No, no. That's us there. See? And those two smaller clouds breaking away are them, and that little one over there trying to decide where to go, that's Betsy. No, she'll be okay. Do you see? She'll be okay on her own. - But I still haven't found the overall intention of my character though. I don't know what motivates him. Let's just go down to the pond. Maybe you can find it there with Pandy's frogs. - Wah. Wah. - [Pandora] Wah! - [James] Wah. - [George] Wah. - [Both] Wah. - Wah. - Wah, wah, wah, wah. - Wah, wah, wah. ♪ Give my regards to Broadway ♪ ♪ Remember me to Herald Square ♪ ♪ Tell all the gang at 42nd Street ♪ ♪ That I will soon be there ♪ ♪ Whisper of how I'm yearning ♪ ♪ To mingle with the old time throng ♪ ♪ Give my regards to Old Broadway ♪ ♪ And say that I'll be there e'er long ♪ ♪ Did you ever see two Yankees part ♪ ♪ Upon a foreign shore ♪ ♪ When the good ship's just about to start ♪ ♪ For old New York once more ♪ ♪ With tear-dimmed eye they say goodbye ♪ ♪ They're friends without a doubt ♪ ♪ When the man on the pier ♪ ♪ Shouts let them clear ♪ ♪ As the ship strikes out ♪ ♪ Give my regards to Broadway ♪ ♪ Remember me to Herald Square ♪ ♪ Tell all the gang at 42nd Street♪ ♪ That I will soon be there ♪ ♪ Whisper of how I'm yearning ♪ ♪ To mingle with the old time throng ♪ ♪ Give my regards to Old Broadway ♪ ♪ And say that I'll be there e're long ♪ ♪ Whisper of how I'm yearning ♪ ♪ To mingle with the old time throng ♪ ♪ Give my regards to old Broadway ♪ ♪ And say that I'll be there e'er long ♪
