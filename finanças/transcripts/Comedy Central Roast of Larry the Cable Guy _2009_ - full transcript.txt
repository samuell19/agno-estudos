I AM TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT LARRY THE CABLE GUY. ( cheering ) TONIGHT WE HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER SOME OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET TO ROAST LARRY. AND BOY, ARE THEY HIDEOUS. LOOK AT THIS BUNCH OF UNATTRACTIVE BASTARDS. THE ONLY WAY THIS DAIS COULD GET ANY UGLIER IS IF THEY INVITED JOHN McCAIN'S NUTSACK. AND TALK ABOUT A BUNCH OF LOSERS-- NICK DiPAOLO, JEFF ROSS, RENO COLLIER. WHAT IS THIS, "LAST COMIC AVAILABLE"? THIS GROUP IS SO WORTHLESS, EVEN THE OCTOMOM WOULD ABORT THEM. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THESE WASTES OF SKIN. MULTI-PLATINUM SELLING COUNTRY ARTIST TOBY KEITH IS HERE. DUDE, I LIKE YOUR HAT. IT'S SO BEAT UP AND FLOPPY IT LOOKS LIKE BRITNEY SPEARS' --. BUT WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT THESE COLOSSAL DISAPPOINTMENTS. TONIGHT WE ARE HERE TO HONOR LARRY THE CABLE GUY. NOW BEFORE WE GET THIS ROAST STARTED, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT MAKES US ALL LOVE LARRY SO MUCH. - ( rock music playing ) - NAME'S LARRY.

LET'S GIT-R-DONE. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE, THAT'S FUNNY. LORD, I APOLOGIZE. LARRY THE CABLE GUY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I'VE ALREADY BEEN SCREWED THREE TIMES OUT OF AN OSCAR. ( rimshot ) IF YOU'RE IN THE GAY MAFIA AND YOU GET WHACKED, IS THAT GOOD OR BAD? I GOT THREE WORDS FOR PETA-- CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. I LOST 50 LBS ON NUTRISYSTEM AND GAINED A WHOLE LOT OF SEXY. BABY, YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, DON'T YA? I GET OFF IN AN HOUR. AIN'T GONNA TAKE THAT LONG. I GOT CRISCO AT MY HOUSE. ( farts ) â™ª I'M A REDNECK PUNK â™ª YOU'RE A REDNECK PUNK. THAT WAS REAL SEXY. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, LARRY THE CABLE GUY. YOU KNOW, IF LARRY THE CABLE GUY WERE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, HE'D SAY "LET'S GET-R-DONE." YOU MUST HEAR THIS WHEREVER YOU GO. I LOVE WHEN MY FANS SAY IT. I MEAN, GIT-R-DONE. - THERE YOU GO, DARLIN'. - I LOVE YOU! Larry: IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE THE CRITICS BASH ME THE BIGGER MY CROWDS GET. KEEP IT COMING. GIT-R-DONE! PLEASE WELCOME OUR GUEST OF HONOR TONIGHT-- LARRY THE CABLE GUY! ( rock music playing ) LARRY THE CABLE GUY. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? YOU'RE SO FAT AND HAIRY YOU COULD BE A STUNT DOUBLE FOR ROSIE O'DONNELL'S --. BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, LOOK AROUND. WE ARE LIVING IN AMAZING TIMES. THERE'S A BLACK MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, LARRY THE CABLE GUY HAS HIS OWN ROAST, AND SOMEBODY ASKED GREG GIRALDO TO BE ON TV AGAIN. DON'T YOU LAUGH GIRALDO. YOU'RE AN ABJECT FAILURE. DUDE, DO YOU EVEN WORK ANYMORE? YOUR DATE BOOK HAS MORE HOLES THAN GARY BUSEY'S BRAIN. THAT'S GOOD. I AIN'T SCREWING WITH YOU, GARY BUSEY. - I'M AFRAID OF YOU. - GOOD. I'D RATHER TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THAT CRAZY CHIMP FROM CONNECTICUT. GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE, MAUREEN McCORMICK. OH, YOU'RE TERRIFIC. MAUREEN McCORMICK. I READ YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY. JESUS CHRIST. YOU WERE MORE UNSTABLE THAN ROBERT REED'S T-CELL COUNT. ( crowd groans ) TOO SOON? AND, HONEY, I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE. I HAVEN'T SEEN A BLONDE LOOKING THIS ROUGHED UP SINCE MICKEY ROURKE IN "THE WRESTLER." WARREN SAPP-- ONE OF THE GREATEST DEFENSIVE LINEMEN OF ALL TIME. ( cheering ) WARREN, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE CUTE. SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE SO HOT IF I OWNED YOU I'D LET YOU IN MY HOUSE. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE FAT AND MISSHAPEN, WARREN. I THINK YOU'RE SEXY. WELL, YOU KNOW ME. I LOVE THE BLACKS. IT'S TRUE. I HAVE BANGED SO MANY BLACK GUYS MY VAG HAS A HORN SECTION. SPEAKING OF BALL HANDLERS, JEFF ROSS IS HERE. ( cheering ) JEFF ROSS HAS A VERY ACTIVE SEX LIFE. EVERY NIGHT HE -- AN ENTIRE AUDIENCE OUT OF 15 BUCKS APIECE. IT'S TRUE. WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT, FOXWORTHY? - OH, HERE WE GO. - WITH YOUR '70s PORN MOUSTACHE. UGH. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN AN UPPER LIP HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THESE FREAKS OF NATURE. LARRY, IT IS AN HONOR TO SERVE AS ROASTMASTER FOR YOU. LARRY WAS RAISED AT A PIG FARM. AND AT AGE 13 HE WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF INSEMINATING THE PIGS. AT AGE 15 HE LEARNED THERE WAS A MACHINE THAT COULD DO IT FOR HIM. A MERE 30 YEARS LATER, LARRY WAS THE BREAKOUT STAR OF THE BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR WITH HIS CATCH PHRASE "GIT-R-DONE." - ( cheering ) - OH YES. GIT-R-DONE! LARRY YELLS "GIT-R-DONE" AND HIS AUDIENCE COMES A-RUNNIN'. GIT-R-DONE IS TO REDNECKS WHAT FREE CHICKEN AND WHITE BITCHES IS TO BLACKS. BUT COME ON, LARRY. HAVEN'T YOU MILKED THIS GIT-R-DONE THING LONG ENOUGH? YOU'VE BEATEN THAT CONCEPT SO HARD IT'S NOW DATING CHRIS BROWN. ( crowd groans ) TODAY, AS A COMEDIAN, LARRY EARNS AN EARTH-SHATTERING $250,000 A NIGHT. $250,000 A NIGHT. $250,000 A NIGHT. I JUST WANT TO SEE HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE TO SAY THAT BEFORE GREG GIRALDO KILLS HIMSELF. LARRY, YOU ARE A MAN WHO EMBODIES TRUE SUCCESS. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AND BELOVED AS YOU ARE. IF I COULD JUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO IT. OH, FOXWORTHY, GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE SO I CAN SUCK YOUR -- TOO. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, YOU READY TO GET THIS ROAST STARTED? OUR FIRST ROASTER THIS EVENING IS LATINO FUNNYMAN GREG GIRALDO. AS A REGULAR ON ALL THE COMEDY CENTRAL ROASTS, HE IS ONE STEP ABOVE THE GUY WHO CLEANS UP THE -- PUDDLES AT THE PORN THEATER. PLEASE WELCOME COMEDY'S CRUEL JOKE-- GREG GIRALDO. - ( cheering ) - ( rock music playing ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. LISA LAMPANELLI. KEEP IT GOING FOR THAT GUY. WASN'T HE FUNNY? SERIOUSLY. WASN'T HE -- HILARIOUS? I LOVE THE PINK CAMOUFLAGE, LISA. YOU'RE LIKE GENERAL FATTON. HOLY SHIT. LOOK AT YOU, YOU FAT --. WHO KNEW LANE BRYANT'S HAD AN ARMY? LISA ACTUALLY HAS A LOT IN COMMON WITH THAT OCTOMOM-- THAT WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO ALL THOSE BABIES. SHE'S NEVER GIVEN BIRTH, BUT SHE HAS HAD 80 FINGERS INSIDE HER AT THE SAME TIME. LOOK AT THIS PACK OF SLOBS UP HERE. GARY BUSEY'S HERE, KIND OF. HOW ABOUT GARY? YEAH. GARY, I GUESS, FLEW IN FROM LOBOTOMY ISLAND. JESUS, GARY, YOU HORSE-FACED LUNATIC. YOU LOOK LIKE NICK NOLTE -- A CLYDESDALE. YOUR TEETH LOOK LIKE A ROW OF URINALS. LOOK AT YOURSELF. EVERY TIME YOU TALK I WANNA PISS IN YOUR MOUTH. AND I DON'T KNOW-- WARREN, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? HOLY SHIT. WARREN WAS GREAT ON "DANCING WITH THE STARS." HE CAME IN SECOND AND THEN CELEBRATED BY DRAGGING HIS PARTNER TO THE TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. ( crowd groans ) IT'S GREAT TO SEE TOBY KEITH. TOBY, I'M GLAD YOU COULD TAKE TIME OUT FROM SPITTING ON MEXICANS TO BE HERE. TOBY, YOU PUT THE BIG IN BIGOT. I LOVED YOUR LAST SONG, "GET OUT OF MY COUNTRY, YOU CAMEL JOCKEY WETBACK FAGGY -- JEW." AND MARSHA BRADY IS HERE. MAUREEN McCORMICK, HUH? HOW ABOUT THAT? HOLY SHIT, MARSHA BRADY. YOU WROTE IN YOUR BOOK YOU USED TO TRADE SEX FOR DRUGS. HOLY SHIT! AS A KID I USED TO FANTASIZE ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH YOU. WHO KNEW ALL I NEEDED WAS AN 8-BALL AND A BUS STATION BATHROOM? ( crowd groans ) AND SPEAKING OF BATHROOM STALLS, WHERE'S THAT REDNECK FRUIT JEFF FOXWORTHY? THERE HE IS. JEFF, YOU LOOK LIKE MAGNUM P.I. WITH AIDS. MY BUDDY NICK DiPAOLO IS HERE. NICK, LOOK AT YOU, YOU BIG HUNCHED-OVER GUINEA. YOU'RE LIKE FONZIE SPINA BIFIDA. AND RENO COLLIER, I DON'T KNOW WHO OR WHAT THAT IS. I-- I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS HE'S PART OF THAT NEXT WAVE OF LOW-BROW DIPSHITS THAT'LL MAKE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF. OR MAYBE HE'S JUST HERE SO LISA LAMPANELLI WOULDN'T BE THE ONLY FAT LESBIAN HACK ONSTAGE. AND NOW ON TO LARRY THE CABLE GUY. THIS IS EXCITING, I GOT TO TELL YOU. I'VE NEVER ROASTED A FAKE CHARACTER BEFORE. MAYBE NEXT YEAR WE COULD ROAST SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. LARRY... LARRY'S WHOLE ACT IS A SHAM, LIKE THE BIBLE OR THE HOLOCAUST. ( crowd groans ) SOME PEOPLE SAY LARRY'S ONLY SUCCESSFUL 'CAUSE HE'S PANDERING TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR AND BLATANTLY AND NON-IRONICALLY EXPLOITING PEOPLE'S RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC TENDENCIES. DON'T LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE, LARRY. THEY'RE JUST BITTER AND JEALOUS AND RIGHT. YOU INBRED HILLBILLY. YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE MORE FARM ANIMALS THAN PURINA. YOU'RE LIKE THE TROJAN ARMY. YOU'RE BIG, PATRIOTIC AND YOU BOTH CAME INSIDE A GIANT HORSE. YOU GRAVY-SWEATING COUSIN --. LARRY -- HIS FIRST COUSIN WHEN HE WAS 16 AND HIS LAST ONE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. YOU LOST 50 LBS ON NUTRISYSTEM AND ANOTHER 10 WHEN YOU SHAVED YOUR BACK. HOW THE -- ARE YOU SO POPULAR? JESUS -- CHRIST. THIS ONE FINALLY BROKE MY BACK. YOUR FANS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD CABLE. THEY'RE NOT COMING 'CAUSE THEY THINK YOU'RE FUNNY. THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A CABLE GUY. YOU COULD HAVE COME UP WITH OTHER CHARACTERS YOUR FANS HAVE NEVER SEEN LIKE LARRY THE DENTIST OR LARRY THE LIBRARIAN OR LARRY THE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. THANKS FOR LETTING ME ROAST YOU, LARRY. YOU MAKE MORE MONEY IN A WEEK THAN I'LL MAKE IN MY LIFE, AND THAT FEELS GOOD, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU. YOU SAY YOU'VE NEVER DONE DRUGS, BUT WATCHING YOUR SUCCESS HAS PUT ME IN REHAB TWICE. SO THANKS FOR RIPPING MY SOUL OUT, YOU HILLBILLY --. ( cheering ) Announcer: COMING UP, TOBY KEITH... - GIT-R-DONE. - ...WARREN SAPP... I THINK I'M OVERDRESSED. - ...JEFFREY ROSS... - LARRY, TAKE IT LIKE A MAN. - ...JEFF FOXWORTHY... - THIS IS THE FILTHIEST SHOW I'VE EVER BEEN A PART OF. - ...AND GARY BUSEY. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID 10 SECONDS AGO. TONIGHT'S NEXT PRESENTER IS PROUD AMERICAN TOBY KEITH. - ( cheering ) - YES. TOBY KEITH ACTUALLY SCREENED HIS FILM "BEER FOR MY HORSES" FOR THE SOLDIERS IN IRAQ. THANKS TO BARACK OBAMA REDEFINING TORTURE, THAT WON'T HAPPEN EVER AGAIN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TOBY KEITH. ( country music playing ) YOU ASKED FOR IT. THAT'S A PRETTY DRESS YOU HAVE ON, LIS. PINK CAMOUFLAGE, THAT'S TRULY NICE. YOU LOOK LIKE APOCALYPSE COW. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TO IRAQ, I'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN, ABOUT 118 SHOWS, BUT LISA STILL HAS THE BIGGEST CAMEL TOE I'VE EVER SEEN. LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE OTHER CITY CLICKERS ONSTAGE. GREG GIRALDO? WHO THE -- IS THAT? YOU WERE REALLY FUNNY TONIGHT, GREG. BETWEEN ROASTS, GREG HAS TO SELL HIS BLOOD, SPERM AND FURNITURE TO MAKE RENT. LUCKILY ALL HIS FURNITURE IS COVERED IN BLOOD AND SPERM. AND JEFF ROSS AND I, MAN, WE BOTH PERFORMED FOR THE TROOPS. DIFFERENCE IS JEFF CHARGED FOR HIS SHOWS. AND JEFF, YOU AMAZED ME ON "DANCING WITH THE STARS," DUDE. LAST TIME I SAW MOVES THAT HOT, LISA GOT HER -- CAUGHT IN HER ZIPPER. AND WARREN SAPP'S HERE. LOOK AT YOU, WARREN, GETTING READY TO DO YOUR FIRST COMEDY STANDUP DEBUT, MAN. YOU LOOK LIKE BERNIE MAC AND CHEESE. AND MAUREEN McCORMICK'S HERE. MARSHA BRADY. MARSH MARSHA MARSHA. MAN... SHE USED TO GET SO HIGH ON COKE SHE'D HEAR VOICES IN HER HEAD. TOO BAD NONE OF THEM WAS AN ACTING COACH. HER COUNTRY MUSIC CAREER WAS SUCH A TRAGIC EVENT, I COULD HAVE WRITTEN THREE ALBUMS ABOUT IT. HER MUSIC WAS SO BAD I FORGAVE THE DIXIE CHICKS. AND IT'S REALLY AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE TONIGHT WITH GARY BUSEY, MAN. GARY BUSEY IS HERE. HE'S A GOOD OLD TEXAS BOY. OKLAHOMA BOY. YOU KNOW, GARY NEVER GOT HIS STAR ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD, BUT, DUDE, YOU DID LEAVE A NOSE ON PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. THE ONLY GUY WHO MADE WORSE TRAVEL DECISIONS THAN YOU, PAL, WAS BUDDY HOLLY. ( crowd groans ) IS IT TOO EARLY FOR THAT SHIT? AND JEFF FOXWORTHY IS SO POPULAR HE HAS FANS THAT FOLLOW HIM FROM SHOW TO SHOW, WHICH IS PRETTY EASY TO DO WHEN THEY LIVE IN THEIR CAR. SAY WHAT Y'ALL WANT TO ABOUT JEFF, BUT HE'S THE ONLY CLEAN COMIC ON THE STAGE. BY THAT I MEAN HE CAN PASS A DRUG TEST. HIS URINE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND ACCORDING TO LARRY, A LITTLE BIT SALTY. OH COME ON, LARRY'S BEEN BLOWING JEFF SO LONG THEY COULD BE COUSINS, MAN. AND YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND LOS ANGELES DRESS LIKE LARRY, YOU KNOW? UNLESS IT'S LESBO BOWLING NIGHT AT HOLLYWOOD LANES. IN "DELTA FARCE" LARRY MADE MOVIE HISTORY. HE WAS THE FIRST GUY EVER TO PLAY A RETARD AND NOT WIN AN OSCAR. ( all laughing ) AND IT'S A GREAT GREAT THING THAT LARRY'S ON NUTRISYSTEM BECAUSE IF HIS FAT, PASTY ASS GOT ANY FATTER, WARREN SAPP WOULD BE TRYING TO -- IT. ( crowd groans ) TRUTH IS, LARRY, YOU PUT A LOT OF SMILES ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FACES. TIMES BEING WHAT THEY ARE, I'D SAY THAT MAKES YOU A PRETTY GREAT MAN. YOU MAY NOT BE SMART, YOU MAY NOT BE FUNNY, BUT SOMEHOW YOU'RE A SUCCESS. LARRY SYMBOLIZES ALL THAT AMERICA HAS TO OFFER. AND AS I SPEAK, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF TROOPS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN SERVING TO PROTECT THAT DREAM-- THAT AND TO GET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AWAY FROM LARRY THE CABLE GUY. GOOD NIGHT. ( music playing ) OUR NEXT ROASTER IS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE DAIS WHO HAS TACKLED MORE BLACK MEN THAN ME-- WARREN SAPP! ( rock music playing ) LET'S HEAR IT FOR LISA LAMPANELLI, OR AS WE-- ( cheering ) --OR AS WE LIKE TO CALL HER AROUND OUR WAY, "OH, THAT BITCH." LISA'S VAGINA IS KNOWN AS THE LIMO, 'CAUSE IT FITS EIGHT, IT HAS LEATHER INTERIOR, AND I CAME IN IT TONIGHT. ( all cheering ) I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS A TRULY SPECIAL NIGHT FOR ME. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER SEEN TOBY AND LARRY WITHOUT THEIR HOODS ON. THE ONLY BLACK THING YOU'LL SEE AT A TOBY KEITH CONCERT IS A WOMAN'S EYE. ( laughing ) WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT, NICK DiPAOLO? YOU'RE SO RACIST, EVERY TIME BARACK OBAMA GETS UP ON THE STAGE, YOU TRY AND BID ON HIM. ( laughing, hooting ) GREG, YOU'RE THE REAL CABLE GUY, BECAUSE NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN HIM ON A NETWORK. AND GARY BUSEY? MOVE YOUR CRAZY WHITE ASS AWAY FROM ME. I'D HATE TO TANGLE WITH A GUY WITH MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES. IT'S LIKE GETTING JUMPED ON BY SIX DUDES AND THREE OF THEM MOTHER-- IS MEXICANS. MAUREEN, "THE BRADY BUNCH" HAD SIX KIDS FROM DIFFERENT FAMILIES ALL LIVING UNDER ONE ROOF. HOW IN THE HELL AIN'T THERE A BLACK PERSON ON THERE? JEFF FOXWORTHY IS HERE. HEY, JEFF, I GOT A NEW ONE FOR YOU: IF YOUR FAMILY TREE HAS A ROPE HANGING FROM IT, YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK. ( hooting, laughing ) I GOT A COUPLE NEW ONES FOR YOU TOO: IF YOU THINK HALLE BERRY IS SOMETHING YOU GET AT JAMBA JUICE, YOU MIGHT BE A CRACKER. IF YOU THINK AFRO SHEEN IS THE STEPBROTHER OF CHARLIE SHEEN DADDY DON'T TALK ABOUT, YOU MIGHT BE A CRACKER. AND IF YOU THINK THE SOUL TRAIN IS A LINE OF BROTHERS BEHIND LISA LAMPANELLI, WELL, OKAY, THAT WOULD BE A SOUL TRAIN. AND NOW ON TO THE GUEST OF HONOR-- LARRY THE CABLE GUY. EVERY TIME YOU'RE ON TV, I TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT ELSE IS ON. THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU "LARRY THE CABLE GUIDE." AND LARRY, LOOK AT YOUR RAGGEDY-ASS CLOTHES. HOW THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT TO GET SOME -- LOOKING LIKE THAT? EVEN YOUR SISTER GAVE YOU A FAKE PHONE NUMBER. LARRY, I'VE DEALT OUT A LOT OF HARD HITS ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD, AND I GOT TO GIVE IT UP TO YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE TAKING HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME FEEL LIKE AN HONORARY REDNECK. AS A BLACK MAN, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE LARRY THE CABLE GUY BECAUSE TONIGHT I SOLD OUT. SORRY, BLACK FOLKS. GOOD NIGHT. ( rock music playing ) Announcer: UP NEXT, JEFFREY ROSS. MAUREEN McCORMICK AND GARY BUSEY-- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? START OVER AND TALK IN ENGLISH. --WHEN THE ROAST OF LARRY THE CABLE GUY CONTINUES. ALLY SORRY THAT I CAN'T BE THERE TONIGHT, BUT IT'S PROBABLY JUST AS WELL BECAUSE TO BE HONEST, I JUST DON'T GET IT. WE'RE ROASTING A GUY WHOSE SUCCESS HINGES ON TWO PHRASES: "NOW THAT'S FUNNY RIGHT THERE" AND "GIT-R-DONE." I MEAN, THE ONLY THING THIS GUY'S REPEATED MORE THAN "GIT-R-DONE" IS THE EIGHTH GRADE. I MEAN, HIS WHOLE CAREER IS BASED ON A LIE, PEOPLE. HIS NAME ISN'T LARRY, HE'S NOT A CABLE GUY, AND FOR GOD'S SAKES, HE ISN'T AN ACTOR. IN ALL THREE OF HIS "BLOCKBUSTER" MOVIES, THEY TRIED TO MAKE HIM THE LOVE INTEREST. I MEAN, COME ON. CASTING LARRY THE CABLE GUY AS A LOVE INTEREST IS LIKE CASTING LISA LAMPANELLI AS... A LOVE INTEREST. UGH! ALL KIDDING ASIDE, DAN, I REALLY DO WISH YOU THE BEST. I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED-- YOU'RE A VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN; YOU'RE A WONDERFUL FATHER AND A DEVOTED HUSBAND; AND I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT YOU ARE MY FRIEND. NOW SEE? THAT'S ACTING! ( cheering ) WOW. YOU KNOW YOU'RE IMPORTANT IN THIS INDUSTRY WHEN BILL ENGVALL TAKES THE TIME TO SEND A TAPE. ( all laughing ) OUR NEXT ACT IS ANNOYING JEW BASTARD JEFF ROSS. ( hooting ) LAST YEAR, DURING "DANCING WITH THE STARS," JEFF HAD TO WEAR AN EYEPATCH. APPARENTLY TAKING A MONEY SHOT FROM LANCE BASS CAN BLIND YOU. BIG HAND FOR THE SANJAYA OF THE COMEDY WORLD, JEFF ROSS! ( rock music playing ) ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, LISA. TOO BAD CHRIS BROWN ISN'T YOUR BOYFRIEND-- HE WOULD HAVE PUNCHED HIMSELF IN THE FACE. YEAH! THIS IS SO FUN. GARY BUSEY-- WOW. HOW YOU DOING, MAN? I LOVE YOU, GARY. YOU'RE LIKE MICKEY ROURKE WITHOUT THE COMEBACK. YEAH. I'M CONFUSED: ARE WE ROASTING LARRY THE CABLE GUY OR GARY THE UNSTABLE GUY? OH, THIS IS A LOT OF FUN. AS YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I ONLY ROAST THE ONES I LOVE, BUT THE ECONOMY'S IN THE CRAPPER, SO... ( hooting ) YEAH! GET-R-ROASTED! THANK YOU, BUDDY. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS-- NOT EVEN A REAL PERSON. HOW COME NOBODY TALKS ABOUT YOUR OTHER PERSONAS YOU TRIED OUT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WELL? YOU KNOW, LIKE "DAN THE COMEDIAN"? ( crowd groans ) OF COURSE, I FIRST DISCOVERED LARRY THE CABLE GUY WHEN HE WAS PART OF THE BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR. YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT? YEAH. WHY'D YOU GUYS BREAK UP? UNCREATIVE DIFFERENCES? ( laughing ) THIS IS LIKE SHOOTING FISH IN A CRACKER BARREL. YEAH. LARRY'S LAST SHOW HAD AN EIGHT-DRINK MINIMUM AND A TWO-TEETH MAXIMUM. MY REAL CABLE GUY DONALD IS FUNNIER THAN YOU. AND YOU KNOW, "GIT-R-DONE" WASN'T EVEN LARRY'S FIRST CHOICE FOR A CATCH PHRASE, BUT SOME OTHER LUCKY INBRED ALREADY USED "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED." YEAH. OH, JEFF FOXWORTHY, GREAT TO SEE YOU. LOOK AT THAT MUSTACHE-- YOU LOOK LIKE A CONFEDERATE PORN STAR. WHO ARE YOU, STONEWALL JACKOFF? ( Ross laughs ) OH, THE LEGENDARY TOBY KEITH. I LOVE THIS GUY. GIVE THIS GUY A ROUND OF APPLAUSE. ( applause ) LOOK AT HIM: "BRING IT ON, BABY." JUST SITTING THERE WAITING FOR A TERRORIST ATTACK SO HE CAN WRITE ANOTHER SONG ABOUT IT. ( crowd groans ) BUT YOU AND I, TOBY, WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON: WE BOTH SUPPORT THE SECOND AMENDMENT, MOSTLY 'CAUSE YOUR MUSIC MAKES ME WANT TO SHOOT MYSELF. AND FOLKS, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T READ LARRY'S BOOK, IT'S ALSO CALLED "GIT-R-DONE." 'CAUSE AFTER THREE PAGES, YOU WANT TO "PUT-R-DOWN." IT'S AN EASY READ-- MOSTLY JUST PICTURES OF SANDWICHES HE -- ON THE ROAD. OH, COME ON, WE ALL KNOW LARRY'S A FREAK. IN FACT, HE'S -- SO MANY FARM ANIMALS, DOWN SOUTH THEY CALL HIM "LARRY THE STABLE GUY." LARRY, REMEMBER: NEIGH MEANS NEIGH. WRITE THAT DOWN, BUDDY. LISA LAMPANELLI, GREAT JOB TONIGHT. YOU ARE REALLY PUTTING THE -- IN COUNTRY. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT YOU COULD PUT A COUNTRY IN YOUR --. FOLKS, LISA LAMPANELLI'S VAGINA IS SO BIG, IT DOESN'T GET WET; IT GETS IRRIGATED. DID I SAY "IRRIGATED"? I MEANT SEGREGATED. IN FACT, WARREN SAPP'S ENTIRE ENTOURAGE IS CHILLING IN THAT BITCH RIGHT NOW. OH, I LOVE WARREN SAPP. HE USED TO BE THE MOST FEARED MAN IN FOOTBALL; NOW HE'S THE MOST FEARED MAN AT HOMETOWN BUFFET. OOH. IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW IT, LARRY COMES FROM A SHOW-BUSINESS FAMILY. IN FACT, HIS DAD WAS THE BANJO PLAYER FROM "DELIVERANCE." BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WAS THAT HIS MOM PLAYED THE GUY WHO -- NED BEATTY. "HE SURE GOT A PRETTY MOUTH, DON'T HE?" IN CLOSING, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU... ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN GIT-R-DONE FOR YOU, ASK HOW THIS... HILLBILLY MORON MADE $30 MILLION LAST YEAR. CONGRATULATIONS, MY FLANNEL-WEARING FRIEND. I LOVE YOU! ( rock music playing ) Announcer: STILL TO COME, GARY BUSEY-- I'M GIVING YOU MY TRUTH FROM MY HEART BECAUSE OF HOW YOU'VE INSPIRED ME... --AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY. OUR NEXT ROASTER IS ACTOR GARY BUSEY. - ( cheering ) - YES. GARY HAS APPEARED IN THE BUDDY HOLLY MOVIE AND IN A BUNCH OF OTHER SHIT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN. BIG HAND FOR A MAN SO DANGEROUS, H.I.V. CROSSES THE STREET WHEN IT SEES HIM COMING, GARY BUSEY! ( rock music playing ) â™ª I LOOK JUST LIKE BUDDY HOLLY â™ª â™ª OH OH, AND YOU'RE MARY TYLER MOORE â™ª â™ª I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT US ANYWAY â™ª â™ª I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT â™ª â™ª I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT... â™ª ( music stops ) FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO SAY THIS IS TRULY AN HONOR TO SHARE THIS STAGE WITH A FELLOW ACTOR WHOSE LIFETIME HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO THE CRAFT, AND HAS SERVED AS AN INSPIRATION TO ME AND ALL THESPIANS ALL OVER THE WORLD-- DOWN THERE AT THE END, SIR JAMES EARL JONES. AND I HAVE TO ADD, I REALLY LIKED YOU IN "NORBIT." ( hooting, laughing ) HOLD IT! HOLD IT, HOLD IT. I'M SERIOUS HERE. JEFF FOXWORTHY, I'VE BEEN TO DOZENS OF YOUR LECTURES. AND DESPITE THE HANDFUL OF RUDE, ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO LAUGHED AT YOUR PRESENTATION, I RECEIVED COMPELLING INFORMATION ABOUT HOW I MIGHT BE A REDNECK. I WANTED TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON LARRY SO I WENT TO A VIDEO STORE AND THEY TOLD ME TO FIND HIS MOVIES IN THE ROOM BEHIND THE PORN. HE WAS IN ONE MOVIE CALLED "WITLESS PROTECTION," WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM WITNESS PROTECTION WHERE THERE'S A CHANCE SOMEBODY MIGHT SEE YOU. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT DVD IS GONNA FLY OFF THE SHELVES IS IF A TORNADO HITS A WALMART. THAT'S IT. AND I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE THE NERVE-- YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO CHARGE 50 BUCKS FOR A TICKET TO YOUR SHOW! THIS-- GOD! I KNOW WHAT IT-- I GUESS SPACE ALIENS AIN'T THE ONLY ONES -- YOUR FANS UP THE ASS. SHAME ON YOU! HEY! HEY. HEY, LOOK. HOW DID THEY GET GARY BUSEY HERE TONIGHT? - HUH? - ( laughing, hooting ) I WONDER, DID SOMEONE TURN ON THE BATSHIT SIGNAL? HEY HEY, GARY? GIVE ME THE NUMBER OF YOUR DENTIST; I NEED TO TILE MY HOT TUB. WHAT? WHAT WHAT? HE'S GOT UNBELIEVABLE TEETH. BUT, GARY, I GOT TO TELL YOU, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE RESCUED BY THE JAWS OF LIFE, NOT WEAR 'EM. IT'S NOT FUNNY. HEY! ( whistling ) HO! WHAT'S SO FUNNY? WHAT'S SO FUNNY WITH YOU PEOPLE? DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO I AM? ( cheering ) SERIOUSLY, TELL ME, BECAUSE I DON'T. IT'S BAD MOJO AT THESE ROASTS IF YOU DON'T MAKE FUN OF LISA "LUMPAGELLI"'S HAUNTED VAGINA. I'M TOLD THAT SHE'S HAD SO MANY BLACK MEN GOING OFF UP INSIDE HER, THAT IF YOU HOLD HER -- UP TO YOUR EAR, YOU'RE GONNA HEAR "SWEET GEORGIA BROWN." ( "Sweet Georgia Brown" playing ) THERE IT IS AGAIN. IS ANYONE ELSE HEARING THAT? - ( music ends ) - LISA, COULD YOU PLEASE SET YOUR -- TO VIBRATE? IT'LL BE A LOT SAFER IN HERE. HA HA! HEY, LARRY. FROM MY HEART, HONESTLY, YOU'RE A GREAT MAN AND YOU HAVE DEVOTED YOUR LIFE TO BRINGING LAUGHTER TO THE MASSES, INCLUDING ME. YET TO THE EDUCATED, YOU ARE THE PREEMINENT POSTMODERN HUMORIST. YOUR ACT HAS HINTS OF... HAROLD PINTER, SAMUEL BECKETT, THEATER OF THE ABSURD-- SHIFTING BETWEEN THE SURREAL TO THE SLAPSTICK. IT STANDS AT THE VANGUARD OF THE DEEP-FRIED DADA MOVEMENT. THAT'S WHERE YOU LIVE-- THAT'S YOUR ADDRESS. ( silent ) AHH, BUT THEN AGAIN, I'M GARY BUSEY... ( cheering ) ...SO WHO KNOWS WHAT THE -- I'M TALKING ABOUT. GOOD NIGHT, CITIZENS OF THE NINTH DIVISION! ( rock music playing ) THE NEXT ROASTER COMING TO THE PODIUM IS LARRY THE CABLE GUY'S OPENING ACT, RENO COLLIER. - ( hooting ) - YES. THAT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING: IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE A PISS OR DO SOME BLOW, GO NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, RENO COLLIER! ( rock music playing ) THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A HUGE GAY FOLLOWING AND I LOVE HAVING SEX WITH BLACK GUYS. THESE AREN'T MY NOTES. OH, NO-- NO, I KNOW WHOSE THEY ARE-- I GOT IT. YOU'RE FIRED. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, I PLAYED NATALIE ON "THE FACTS OF LIFE." - ( cheering ) - THANK YOU. NO, LARRY AND I HAVE SPENT THE LAST FEW YEARS TOURING TOGETHER OUT ON THE ROAD, AND NOW WE SPEND OUR DAYS TRAINING WITH A TRAINER. HA! WHAT A JOKE. DUDE, LOOK AT US. AND WE'RE ALWAYS DIETING. FIRST YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO ATKINS, SO YOU MADE UP YOUR OWN DIET CALLED THE "AIKEN'S DIET." THAT'S WHERE HE SAID HE COULD EAT AS MUCH STUFF AS HE WANTED-- CAKE, PIE, RIBS-- THEN LOOK AT A PICTURE OF CLAY AIKEN HOLDING HIS BABY AND HE'D THROW ALL THAT SHIT BACK UP. LISA LAMPANELLI LOST 100 LBS, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS POACHED FOR IVORY. ( crowd groans ) ( laughing ) MANY-- MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT LARRY PLAYED A LITTLE BASEBALL IN COLLEGE AND APPARENTLY AT SOME POINT WAS CLOCKED THROWING A PITCH 90-mph. THAT'S WHAT THE PROS THROW. THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE IN COMMON WITH PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL IS LIP CANCER AND A SHITLOAD OF BAD PRESS. NO, HE REALLY DOES USE TOBACCO. THAT'S NOT FUNNY. IT'S NOT HIS FAULT; IT RUNS IN HIS FAMILY. HIS PARENTS ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE HIM CIRCUMCISED SO HE'D HAVE SOMEWHERE TO KEEP HIS CHEW WHILE HE ATE HIS LUNCH. TRUE STORY. BEFORE I GO, LARRY, I ASKED YOUR WIFE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT SHE'D LIKE TO ADD TO THIS ROAST. AND SHE SAID YES. SHE WANTED ME TO SHARE WITH EVERYBODY THIS: "IF-- IF YOU MARRY SOMEBODY FOR MONEY, YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR IT EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE." AND THEN SHE WANTED ME TO SHOW EVERYBODY THESE. I WANT TO TELL YOU, DUDE, THE LAST THREE YEARS TOURING WITH YOU HAVE BEEN AWESOME, MAN. AND I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM WATCHING YOU. AND I GOTTA TELL YOU, IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO BE THIS GUY'S FRIEND, YOU'RE REALLY MISSING OUT, MAN. I LOVE YOU, BUDDY. ( rock music playing ) Announcer: COMING UP, JEFF FOXWORTHY-- PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE. MOM, LOOK WHO IT IS! MAUREEN McCORMICK, NICK DiPAOLO, AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY GETS THE LAST WORD-- GARY BUSEY-- I'M SO MAD AT HIM THAT HE DID WELL, 'CAUSE I HAD ALL THESE -- LINES WRITTEN FOR AFTER HE SUCKED AND HE DIDN'T. --WHEN THE ROAST OF LARRY THE CABLE GUY CONTINUES. OUR NEXT PRESENTER IS "BRADY BUNCH" FANTASY GIRL MAUREEN McCORMICK. YES. ( cheering ) LARRY ASKED TO HAVE MAUREEN HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE HE WANTED SOMEONE HE USED TO MASTURBATE TO IN HIGH SCHOOL AND MR. ED WASN'T AVAILABLE. A GIRL WHO'S PUT AWAY MORE DRUGS THAN A WALGREEN'S STOCK BOY, MAUREEN McCORMICK! â™ª I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK OUTSIDE NOW â™ª â™ª THE SUMMER SUN'S CALLING MY NAME â™ª â™ª I HEAR YOU NOW, I JUST CAN'T STAY INSIDE ALL DAY... â™ª LARRY, THIS IS A BIG NIGHT FOR ME TOO BECAUSE AFTER YEARS OF DRUG ABUSE, SEX ADDICTION AND REHAB, WITH THIS ROAST, I WILL FINALLY FINISH MY COMMUNITY SERVICE. ( cheering ) BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE IN RECOVERY, I'M UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO HELP HOLLYWOOD'S CELEBRITIES, OR THESE PEOPLE. AS YOU KNOW, #9 OF THE 12 STEPS IS MAKING AMENDS. SO I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID 20 YEARS AGO: GARY BUSEY, I'M SORRY I CUT YOU OFF IN TRAFFIC THAT DAY. WOW! WHEW! I FEEL BETTER. IF THERE IS ONE THING I'VE GAINED IN RECOVERY, IT'S THE WISDOM TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN CHANGE AND THINGS YOU CAN'T. TOBY KEITH, WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW, THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE LIBERALS IN THE WORLD, MEXICANS AND BLACKS AND MUSLIMS AND JEWS AND HIGH-SCHOOL GRADUATES... AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO HATES YOUR MUSIC. THERE ARE BRIGHT SPOTS FOR YOU, TOBY. AS LONG AS THERE'S A FLAG WAVING, A HONKY-TONK LEFT STANDING, OR A PREGNANT WOMAN IN STRETCH PANTS ON HER SECOND PACK OF MARLBOROS BEATING HER KIDS IN A WALMART, YOU, TOBY KEITH, ARE LOVED! YOU KNOW, THE BUDDHA SAYS, "LIFE IS STRUGGLE." WE ALL HAVE TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES, LIKE WARREN SAPP'S COURAGEOUS BATTLE WITH LITERACY. LOOK AT YOU, WARREN. YOU HAVE COME SO FAR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ABILITY TO READ OR WRITE. YOU DANCE WITH STARS EVEN THOUGH YOU LOOK LIKE SHREK IF HE GREW UP IN SOUTH CENTRAL. LISA LAMPANELLI-- YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION TO ANYONE ON THE PATH TO SOBRIETY. I'M SURE YOU'LL NEVER DEVELOP A COKE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD FOR YOU TO LOOK INTO A MIRROR. BUT IF I COULD OFFER ONE TINY HELPFUL BIT OF CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE BLACK -- THRUST INTO YOUR VAGINA OR YOUR CLAMMY FAT ROLLS, IS REALLY A DAGGER STABBING INTO YOUR FATHER'S HEART. NO AMOUNT OF -- SHOT IN YOUR FACE WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WASH AWAY HIS TEARS. MY GREATEST HONOR IS TO SHARE THIS STAGE WITH THE STAR OF "THE JEFF FOXWORTHY SHOW." JEFF, I RELATE TO YOU SO PROFOUNDLY. I TOO STARRED ON A FAMILY SITCOM WITH A FATHER WHO WAS SECRETLY GAY. WE ALL KNOW THAT YOUR MUSTACHE IS AN OUTDATED CRY FOR HELP AND THAT YOUR TIGHT JEANS ARE A BEACON TO EVERY TRUCK-STOP QUEEN LOOKING TO HAVE HIS BALLS DRAINED DURING A CROSS-COUNTRY HAUL. I REMEMBER ONE TRAUMATIC TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN MARSHA BRADY GOT BRACES. NOW, LARRY, BRACES ARE THINGS THAT WE USE TO STRAIGHTEN OUR TEETH WITH. NO? OKAY, YOU SEE, TEETH ARE THOSE YELLOW THINGS IN YOUR MOUTH THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN. CLEANING IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE RESPECT FOR YOURSELF. AND LARRY, RESPECT IS WHAT YOU TRADED FOR FAME WHEN YOU MADE YOUR DEAL WITH SATAN. LARRY, THE TRUTH IS, YOU'RE A KIND SOUL, A DEDICATED FATHER, AND YOU WILL LEAVE A LEGACY OF LAUGHTER. AND SO... I SAY TO ALL OF YOU, BE WILLING TO ACCEPT WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN IN THE EYES OF GOD, EXCEPT GREG GIRALDO. YOU'RE --. ( cheering ) THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT. ( rock music playing ) Announcer: UP NEXT, NICK DiPAOLO, JEFF FOXWORTHY AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY-- YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAD A BLAST DOING THE REHEARSAL. AS FAR AS THE SHOW GOES, I THINK IT'S GONNA BLOW. --WHEN THE ROAST OF LARRY THE CABLE GUY CONTINUES. OUR NEXT ROASTER IS BLUE-COLLAR-COMEDY MAESTRO JEFF FOXWORTHY. ( cheering ) JEFF FOXWORTHY IS A LEGEND! EVERY TIME I SEE HIS MUSTACHE IT REMINDS ME TO WAX MY LIP. AND EVERY TIME I HEAR HIS JOKES IT REMINDS ME TO WIPE MY ASS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. JEFF FOXWORTHY! ( rock music playing ) FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO GIVE A BIG SHOUT-OUT TO MY SUNDAY-SCHOOL CLASS. I'M SURE THEY'RE ALL WATCHING THIS TONIGHT. HOLY COW. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A CLASSY EVENT WHEN I HEARD LISA LAMPANELLI WAS GOING TO BE HOSTING. GOD, YOU COULD PLAY LISA'S CD IN A TRUCK STOP AND TRUCKERS WOULD BE GOING, "HEY HEY HEY, THERE'S MECHANICS IN HERE!" PRETTY COOL TO MEET GARY BUSEY TONIGHT. I THINK GARY'S KIND OF LIKE SEX-- YOU WANT TO DO IT, YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE WHEN YOU DO IT. I HEARD THAT! RENO COLLIER, CONGRATULATIONS. I THINK YOU'VE SOLIDIFIED YOUR POSITION AS AN OPENING ACT WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE TONIGHT. ( crowd groans ) WHILE WE'RE AT IT, I'D LIKE TO THANK BILL ENGVALL FOR MAILING IT IN. LARRY, THAT OUGHT TO KEEP YOU HUMBLE. ENGVALL, THE GUY THAT WOULD SHOW UP FOR THE GRAND OPENING OF A LAUNDROMAT HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO TONIGHT. GREG GIRALDO, NICE JOB. THREE HOURS FROM NOW, LARRY'S GONNA BE ON HIS LEARJET HEADED HOME AND YOU'RE GONNA BE SITTING IN THE DRIVE-THRU AT CARL'S JR. YELLING AT THE SPEAKER, "ARE Y'ALL STILL OPEN?" BRINGS ME TO MY BUDDY LARRY. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME, "DID YOU SEE LARRY'S LATEST MOVIE?" I ALWAYS ANSWER, "NO, BUT I FLUSHED A $10 BILL DOWN THE TOILET SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN IT.' I ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE TO BE IN "DELTA FARCE," BUT I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE I READ THE SCRIPT. UH... I'VE FOUND THE BEST WAY TO ENJOY LARRY'S MOVIES IS NEVER PUT 'EM IN THE DVD PLAYER. NUTRISYSTEM GAVE LARRY A MILLION BUCKS TO LOSE 50 LBS, WHICH ANALYSTS HAVE TRACED BACK TO THE COLLAPSE OF OUR ECONOMY. PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME, "WHAT'S THE MOST FUN THING YOU'VE EVER DONE IN YOUR CAREER?" AND I ALWAYS ANSWER, "THE BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR." - ( cheering ) - THANK YOU. I REMEMBER ALL THOSE YEARS RIDING THAT BUS, YOU KNOW, TALKING WITH LARRY DEEP INTO THE NIGHT. AND HE WAS JUST ALWAYS SO EAGER TO LEARN-- CONSTANTLY ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE, "IS SECOND BASE OVER THE SHIRT OR UNDER THE SHIRT?" AT WHICH POINT I WOULD GO TO RON'S BUNK, PULL OUT THE INFLATABLE DOLL AND SHOW HIM ONE MORE TIME. THE AMAZING THING TO ME IS HE'S HAPPILY MARRIED. SHE'S MISERABLE, BUT HE'S HAPPY AS A CLAM. I KNOW IT'S TOUGH HAVING LITTLE KIDS AND BEING OUT ON THE ROAD ALL THE TIME. IN FACT, I ASKED LARRY'S WIFE CARA-- I SAID, "HOW DO YOU AND LARRY DO IT?" SHE SAID, "I JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND PRETEND IT ISN'T HAPPENING." SHE SAID CONCEIVING THOSE TWO CHILDREN WAS THE WORST 30 SECONDS OF HER LIFE. AND YOU KNOW THE COOLEST THING? LARRY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SHARE HIS ART WITH THE WORLD WHILE REMAINING TRUE TO HIS INBRED, ILLITERATE ROOTS. AND SUCCESS DID NOT GO TO YOUR HEAD. TO YOUR STOMACH, ASS AND THIGHS, YEAH, BUT NEVER TO YOUR HEAD. GREG GIRALDO, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUNNEL CAKES YOU CAN BUY WITH $50 MILLION? HE DOES. I THINK THE JOKE'S ON ALL OF US-- THIS GUY IS ON THE "FORBES" LIST FOR GIVING THE WORLD ROUTINES LIKE "BISCUITS AND GRAVY," "EATIN' BRITCHES" AND "POOP LASAGNA." AND I SALUTE YOU, SIR. AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS: I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE HAPPY FOR SOMEONE'S SUCCESS. AND THE COOL THING ABOUT THIS GUY-- HE IS SO KIND AND HE IS SO GENEROUS IN WAYS THAT PEOPLE NEVER EVER SEE AND I LOVE YOU, DUDE. CONGRATULATIONS. AND I HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. ( rock music playing ) STILL TO COME, NICK DiPAOLO - AND LARRY THE CABLE GUY-- - I'LL BE GOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW-- I CAN'T GUARANTEE THE REST OF 'EM. --WHEN THE ROAST OF LARRY THE CABLE GUY CONTINUES. OUR NEXT PERFORMER COMING TO THE PODIUM IS NICK DiPAOLO. NICK'S IN HIS ELEMENT HERE TODAY BECAUSE HE'S USED TO WORKING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE WHO'S THERE TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE. PLEASE WELCOME GUINEA GREASEBALL COMEDIAN NICK DiPAOLO! ( rock music playing ) LISA LAMPANELLI, EVERYBODY. HUH? COME ON. SHE'S SLEPT WITH SO MANY BLACK GUYS, 50 MURDERS ARE SOLVED EVERY TIME SHE HAS A PAP SMEAR. THAT'S RIGHT. I WROTE THAT SHIT MYSELF. HER -- PHONE HAS SO MANY BLACK GUYS ON SPEED DIAL, SHE CALLS IT HER "SICKLE CELL." DON'T GET TOUCHY NOW, YOU --. SERIOUSLY. JEFF ROSS, HUH? HOW ABOUT JEFF ROSS? YEAH. SOMEBODY BACKSTAGE SAID, "WHAT'S A ROAST WITHOUT JEFF ROSS?" I DON'T KNOW. HOW ABOUT FUNNY? -- TOBY KEITH. IS TOBY KEITH YOUR REAL NAME OR THE FIRST TWO GUYS YOU BLEW? JEFF FOXWORTHY, THAT MUSTACHE MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A PEDOPHILE. THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR SHOW TO, "ARE YOU -- THAN A FIFTH GRADER?" ( crowd groans ) YEAH. JEFF'S A BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIAN WHICH IS NO SURPRISE-- PEOPLE ALWAYS FIND JESUS AFTER THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING UNFORGIVEABLE, LIKE "THE JEFF FOXWORTHY SHOW." MAUREEN McCORMICK-- I'LL TELL YOU, DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I MASTURBATED TO YOU AS A KID WHEN THE CREDITS WERE ROLLING AT THE END OF "THE BRADY BUNCH"? TO THIS DAY, I CAN'T PLAY TIC-TAC-TOE WITHOUT GETTING A HARD-ON. "MARSHA MARSHA MARSHA"-- THAT WASN'T JAN; THAT WAS ME IN THE SHOWER AT AGE 12 WITH A HANDFUL OF PRELL. -- GARY BUSEY-- HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR A BRAIN INJURY TO HEAL? JESUS CHRIST. APPARENTLY, GARY DAMAGED EVERY PART OF THE BRAIN EXCEPT FOR ONE-- THE ASSHOLE LOBE. SIT DOWN, YOU RETARD. WH-- OH, GOODNESS. I SAW WARREN ON "DANCING WITH THE STARS." IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A LEATHER COUCH DURING AN EARTHQUAKE. I HEARD HIS AGENT BACKSTAGE ARGUING ON THE PHONE ABOUT HIS CONTRACT FOR THE ROAST. I ACTUALLY HEARD HIS AGENT SAY THIS-- "NO NO NO, I SAID, '45 ACRES AND THREE MULES.'" All: AWWW! IT'S A GREAT JOKE, YOU WHITE LIBERAL --. ANYWAYS... BLACK PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING; ALL THE WHITE -- OBAMA FANS ARE CRYING. GO -- YOURSELF. ANYWAYS-- LET'S GET TO LARRY, HUH? JESUS. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE BRETT FAVRE, SOUNDS LIKE GOMER PYLE AND DRESSES LIKE ELLEN DeGENERES? WE ALL KNOW HIS REAL NAME IS DAN WHITNEY, BUT HE HAD TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE IT HAD THE WORD "WIT" IN IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S IRONIC: WE'RE ROASTING LARRY THE CABLE GUY, YET HALF HIS FANS AREN'T GOING TO SEE THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T MADE THE SWITCH FROM -- ANALOG. RIGHT NOW IN APPALACHIA, THERE'S 200 MONGOLOIDS STANDING ON THE ROOFS OF THEIR OUTHOUSES WITH THEIR -- WRAPPED IN TIN FOIL FACING DUE NORTH. BOY, I SHOULD HAVE STAYED SOBER. --. I SAW LARRY BACKSTAGE WITH A LONG FACE SNIFFING HIS FINGERS. I SAID, "WHAT'S THE MATTER?" HE GOES, "I MISS MY FAMILY." LARRY KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT POLITICS. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF OBAMA'S STIMULUS PACKAGE, AND HE SAID, "WHAT CAN I SAY? BLACK GUYS GOT BIG --." THANKS A LOT. I APPRECIATE IT. LARRY-- COME ON! DANNY WHITNEY-- I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. HE WAS FUNNY BEFORE HE WAS LARRY; HE'S FUNNY NOW, AND HE DESERVES EVERY GODDAMNED PENNY HE MAKES. THANKS A LOT. ( rock music playing ) Announcer: UP NEXT, LARRY THE CABLE GUY-- I GOT A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. THEY CAN BASH ME ALL THEY WANT TO. I LOVE THEM GUYS. LISA LAMPANELLI'S KIND OF A BITCH, THOUGH. --WHEN THE ROAST OF LARRY THE CABLE GUY CONTINUES. WELL, LARRY THE CABLE GUY, NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GET YOUR REVENGE. LARRY THE CABLE GUY HAS EVERYTHING: SLEEVELESS SHIRT, STUPID CATCH PHRASE-- HE'S MR. T WITHOUT THE ACTING CHOPS. HE'S CALLED "CABLE GUY" BECAUSE AFTER YOU HEAR HIS ACT, YOU WANT TO TAKE SOME CABLE AND HANG YOURSELF. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE CLAP FOR THE MAN OF THE HOUR AND OUR GUEST OF HONOR-- LARRY THE CABLE GUY! ( rock music playing ) All chanting: LARRY, LARRY, LARRY. EH, GIT-R-DONE! ( all cheering ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS AWESOME. LISA LAMPANELLI AGAIN, EVERYBODY. ONE MORE HAND FOR OLD LISA. I MEAN, LET'S FACE FACTS, LISA'S NOT THE SHINIEST LURE IN THE TACKLE BOX. FRONT-ROW TICKETS TO LISA'S SHOW ARE 100 BUCKS AND OBSTRUCTED-VIEW TICKETS IS $150. BUT... I WANT TO TELL YA, EVERYBODY HERE SUCKS SO BAD, I THINK I'M GONNA GIVE 'EM ALL A PART IN MY NEXT MOVIE. THE GUYS THAT ARE HERE TONIGHT ARE SOME OF THE MOST BRIGHTEST TALENT IN THE COUNTRY AND GARY BUSEY. Man: GARY! I HAVE NO IDEA WHY GARY-- OR HOW HE GOT ON MY ROAST. UH, I GUESS DR. DREW MUST BE ON HIATUS THIS WEEK. LOOK AT THAT-- MY BUDDY JEFF FOXWORTHY; I GOT MY BUDDY TOBY KEITH; I GOT ARETHA FRANKLIN DOWN THERE ON THE END. YOU KNOW? I MEAN, WARREN, DON'T YOU FEEL KINDA WEIRD? TWO WOMEN ON THE DAIS UP HERE AND YOU GOT BIGGER TITS THAN BOTH OF 'EM. GOOD TO SEE MY BUDDY TOBY HERE TONIGHT. HE'S A GOOD BUDDY OF MINE AND A GOOD AMERICAN. HIS BLOOD'S RED, HIS PICKET FENCE IS WHITE, AND HIS LAST ALBUM "BLEW." YOU KNOW WHAT? TOBY ALWAYS WRITES SONGS ABOUT DIVE BARS WITH CRUSTY WAITRESSES AND A JUKEBOX WITH STICKY FLOORS AND SIGNS OUT FRONT THAT SAY, "APPEARING TONIGHT, GREG GIRALDO." BUT, GREG, DON'T WORRY-- ONE DAY OPPORTUNITY WILL KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR. AND YOU WILL ANSWER IT. AND IT WILL ASK FOR DIRECTIONS TO CARLOS MENCIA'S HOUSE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY COOL? I WANT TO THANK MARSHA BRADY FOR BEING HERE. AND SHE'S CRAZY. SHE WALKED BEHIND ME; I'M LIKE "MAN, THAT'S MARSHA BRADY, MAN, FROM 'THE BRADY BUNCH.'" I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. YOU KNOW, THE GIRL I HAD A CRUSH ON MY WHOLE LIFE AND NOW SHE'S HERE. AND I JUST GOTTA SAY, WHAT HAPPENED? - ( crowd groans ) - I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I THINK I'D RATHER BANG SAM THE BUTCHER TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BUT-- BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, WHAT HAPPENED? UH, NO. THANKS FOR COMING. THANKS FOR TAKING THE DAY OFF WALMART TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, I GET A LOT OF FLAK FROM CRITICS FOR BEING HOMOPHOBIC. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: I THINK HAVING INVITED JEFF ROSS HERE TONIGHT PROVES HOW MUCH I LOVE THE QUEERS. THAT BRINGS ME TO MY GOOD BUDDY RENO COLLIER. NOBODY KNEW REALLY ACTUALLY WHO RENO WAS WHEN HE WAS HERE. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE RUNNING UP TO ME AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE, "HEY, WHO'S THAT FAT DUDE THAT LOOKS LIKE PETER GRIFFIN FROM 'FAMILY GUY'?" OUT OF ALL THE OPENING ACTS AND MIDDLE ACTS HERE TONIGHT, NICK DiPAOLO IS MY FAVORITE. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, BUT NICK DiPAOLO HAD THE INSIDE TRACK TO DO "SMARTER THAN A FIFTH GRADER" OVER JEFF. AND HE ALMOST GOT IT AND THEN THE EXECUTIVES FOUND OUT THAT NICK WASN'T ALLOWED WITHIN 500yds OF A FIFTH GRADER. SO... AND THAT BRINGS ME TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND MENTORS IN THE WHOLE WORLD OF COMEDY, AND THAT'S MY BUDDY JEFF FOXWORTHY. THAT'S RIGHT. JEFF WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE ME ON THE ROAD WITH HIM AT THE PEAK OF HIS CAREER. AND HE KEPT DOING IT EVEN AFTER 1997. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO THIS JOKE FOR JEFF A LONG TIME. BUT THIS IS ONE I COME UP WITH THAT MAYBE YOU CAN USE: IF YOU UNDERESTIMATE THE TALENT OF YOUR OPENING ACT AND WATCH HIM GO ON TO MAKE MORE MONEY THAN YOU, YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK. AND WITH THAT SAID, I GOTTA SAY, IT WAS A BLAST TO SIT HERE TONIGHT AND TAKE THE SHOTS. YOU KNOW, I'M A PRETTY EASY TARGET. IT WASN'T HARD TO MAKE FUN OF ME, SO... I JUST GOTTA SAY, I'VE GOT HUGE RESPECT FOR EVERYBODY UP HERE. EVERYBODY UP HERE IS A FRIEND OF MINE. I'M HONORED TO BE SITTING RIGHT THERE IN THE ROASTING CHAIR. I'M HONORED THAT THESE GUYS THINK ENOUGH OF ME TO COME OUT HERE AND MAKE FUN OF HOW MUCH I SUCK. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, I LIKE MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH-- I LOVE DOING THAT. AND I'M GLAD THAT PEOPLE LIKE IT. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR LETTING ME LIVE MY DREAM OF BEING ABLE TO DO COMEDY. AND I TAKE MY INSPIRATION FROM THE FELLOW THAT WROTE THIS: ( British accent ) "TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE, AND IT MUST FOLLOW AS THE DAY THE NIGHT, THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO ANY MAN!" BUT THAT DON'T FIT ON A BALL CAP, SO GIT-R-DONE! ( all cheering ) - ( rock music playing ) - THANKS AGAIN. â™ª SWEET HOME ALABAMA â™ª WHERE THE SKIES ARE SO BLUE... â™ª U ARE HEE-HAWFUL. ( laughing ) LARRY, I'VE SEEN YOUR ACT-- YOU ARE HEE-HAWFUL. THE ONLY THING MORE CLOGGED THAN YOUR TOILET - IS YOUR ARTERIES. - ( light chuckles ) - --IS YOUR ARTERIES. - ( laughter ) IT WORKED FOR JEFF ROSS. LARRY'S SUCH A RACIST, TO GET HIM TO THE SHOW TONIGHT, HIS AGENT AND MANAGER WERE "MEIN KAMPF"ED. "MEIN KAMPF"ED, HE SAID TO THE DRUNKEN BITCHES FROM HOLLYWOOD WHO WOULDN'T GET A JOKE IF IT BIT THEM IN THE --. HE DID GOOD, DIDN'T HE? - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - HIS FIRST ROAST HE EVER DID. I FEEL LIKE ALL IN ALL, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST ROASTS. I GOT HAMMERED PRETTY GOOD. I ENJOYED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD FUN STANDS FOR-- F-U-N? "FINALLY UNDERSTANDING NOTHING." THAT'S FUN.
