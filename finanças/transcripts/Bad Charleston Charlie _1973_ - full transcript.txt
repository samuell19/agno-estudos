Well, the boy's been up there three weeks. One more week, and we'regonna be regional champion. Three weeks! See that class? Takes a lot of guts.

Leave the lady alone. Nothing wrong with Lottie, she's all right. CHARLIE: You know, we're gonna have the biggest gang in southern Illinois. First thing we gotta do isget rid of the Ku Klux Klan. Looky there-- what's that? CHARLIE: Hey, I know that guy. LOTTIE: Hey, I know that guy, too. CHARLIE: Oh, Lottie, I did--I tried to promote him. That's that Westinghouse-- the guy with the phony English accent. Chin up, my dear! These might be the judges! Good morning! My name's Claude! Claude Westinghouse, inventor by trade. These are the hands of futures! Pick one! There ain't anything I don't know about! Well, listen, what are you doing out here? We're trying to establish along-distance tango record! We're in the semi-finals! But I thought you said you was an inventor? In case you haven't noticed it,my friend, these are bad times. And a man's got to eat, don't he? [heavy breathing] Last time I came down this road, I was with a Shakespeare company! I'm afraid Billy's going fast. Would anyone here like tojoin me for the next 100 miles or so? No, but would you like to join our gang? Join a gang? Any money it it? Yeah. A lot of girls, too. It's getting harder all the time to find girls with any stamina. Got weak ankles. Nice cans.

You know what we've got to do here, don't ya? We have just got to s-- screw our courage to the sticking post! I mean, actually, you see, this-- this is an incredible idea, because nobody would ever live here, see? I like it. Well, let me put it another way. You see, things are not always what they seem. You see, now on the outside,we have an appearance of one thing, but once we move inhere, it's quite another thing entirely, you see? It's-- You mean like a disguise, huh? Like a disguise. [chuckling] That's what we had in mind the whole time. That's good thinking, Charles. I gotta tell you about my dream-- the swellest, biggest roadhouse in southern Illinois. [inaudible]. [music playing] [music playing] [snoring] [coughing] Could you hold the noise down a little, fellas? I have a terrible headache. You're right. I kinda like this place. Well, I don't anymore. Well, wait a minute, youse guys. There ain't nothing wrongwith this place a little water and salt won't cure. I'll tell you something, gentlemen. There's one little thing thatI believe we're all overlooking here, and that is the factthat a renovation of-- of this size-- it-- it would just takean awful lot of greenbacks. A lot of money. Yeah. You know, I've been-- I'vebeen laying here all night. I've been thinking up an idea. We're gonna rob the bank. Rob a bank? Yup. Have you robbed a bank before, Charles? Well, I tell you, not exactly, but I figure with all the brainpower around here, we're bound to come up with something good. [laughing] I-- you-- I really like this idea. I think it's really a goodone, you know, Charlie? I mean, first we've got to case the bank, and then we rob it, see? In that-- in that order. [music playing] Gentlemen, success is ours. Now, number one, for the toll disguise, I believe that you and Thad should wear suits. Yuki doesn't have a suit,so he can wait outside. The rest of us will look all business. Now, Yuki, put the guns in the car. We don't want to carry them on our person. You will park the car on a 30 degree angle. Now, the doors fly open. Jump out of the car. Run to the bank door, slam it open, run inside at a fast pace,and, uh-- stick 'em up! Stick 'em up! --[inaudible] rob thatbank somewhere else, man, because you've got the wrong guys. Uh, Mr. Babcock-- you betterget out here, because some thugs want to see you! Mr. Babcock! It's best you come on out! Good morning. Good morning. May I help you? This is a stick-up. Now give us all your money,and we'll be on our way. I'm very sorry, butunfortunately, as you can see, we are redecorating, and wejust don't have any money here. Hey, wait a minute. You're-- you're a bank, you gotta have money. Huh, well, we sent all ourmoney to our main office in Harpersville. Maybe I can call and set up an appointment. Would you like it in big bills? No big bills-- they're too easily identified. You know, we can't take big bills. They're too easy to identify. Well, well-- why don't you stop back Monday? We'll be open for business, and there'll be plenty of money available. Mr. Babcock, you don't understand-- this is a precision plan. We're going to rob this bank today, right now. See if you can't find some money. Well, I don't-- I'm sorry, but-- why don't I look in the back and see what I can find? Why don't you do that? Yes, I will. Yeah. Why don't you come help me look? That's more like it. Now, why don't you look overhere, and I look over here. Man, sometimes-- Um-- Hm? Mr. Babcock, hold that. Oh, certainly. What are you mixin' up there? What is that? A little wheat, put that on walls. What the-- what's wrong with his eyes? Well, he just paints the trim. Well, can he-- can he paint straight? Sure, sure.
