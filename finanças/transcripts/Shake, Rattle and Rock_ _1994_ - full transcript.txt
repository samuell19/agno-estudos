Your job. They're part of our community, man. They all live in this town with us. Or do you just drive your shiny Cadillac... through their neighborhoods with blinders on ? I hate guys like you ! You get your hands off of me. You know, when I hired you, people told me you were trouble, but you were good at what you did, so I didn't listen. I gave you a shot. But you know what ? You failed. You're fired, you weirdo. Get outta here. You know something, Lipsky ? I was hopin' you'd say that. See you around. [ Doorbell Rings ] Susan, dinner's almost ready. Yes ? May I help you ? I'm a friend of Susan's. Really ? - No, you're not. - Did you dance on that show again ? He's not from the show, Mom. They call me Lucky. Lucky Mullins, Mrs. Doyle. God, you have unbelievable nerve. And you have an unbelievable figure. You oughta wear threads like that more often. You know, it suits you. Oh, I do. Just not around guys like you. Susan. I think we have to talk. It looks like you have a very comfortable home here. Yes, sirree. Very comfortable. [ Clears Throat ] Don't worry. I can handle him. What, were you born in a barn ? You know, you're right. I do have to work on my manners. How's this ? Uh, you have a very comfortable couch, Miss Doyle. Is that better ? Or would you rather I call you "Little Red" ? You're a lucky girl, you know that ? You got it all. Oh, yeah. And you've got nothing. Well, maybe not right now. But, uh, when I want somethin', there's no stopping me. You can't always get what you want. But sometimes you can get what you need. [ Shouting ] Susan ! Looks like you... need your mama. Sorry if I've disturbed you, Mrs. Doyle. It was sweet, Susan. I think I saw a knife in his pocket. You hang out with people who carry knives ? - [ Laughs ] - What, may I ask, is so funny ? Wh-What, did you think he was gonna kill me ? Chop me up into little bitty pieces ? Okay. You listen to me, young lady. If I don't see an immediate change in your behavior, I am going to tear up every college and university application you have, and you are going to spend next year at City Junior College, living right in this house where I can keep an eye on you. Do you hear me ? You can't do that. I can do anything I want. I am your mother. I hate you. Susan ! Susan ! Susan Doyle, you come back here ! Hi. Hi. Did you run away from home or something ? Yes. No. I'm just kidding. I wish. Well, you're not m-mad at me, are ya ? Uh-uh. I'm mad at the mother from the ocean floor. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, well, you can join the club. Here, let me cheer you up. I'm gonna make us famous, Susan. Just like Eddie Cochran. What do you think ? Hey, with us and Sireena, we got a hot double bill. Where did you get that picture ? You don't remember, but we were takin' it. Last year, we took it. We were horsin' around ? You know ? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This concert is Saturday night. Yeah.

Dad, she doesn't trust me. How could she love me ? Oh, honey, she trusts you. It's-- It's-- It's the music, you know. Tell me about this music. The music ? Come in ! All right. Um, the music. Rock-and-roll music. Oh, I don't know, Dad. Haven't you ever listened to something that sets your body on fire ? You know, it touches you in places that you didn't even know existed ? [ Laughs ] Well, that's rock and roll, Dad. You know, it's got this ba-ti-ti-ba, ti-ba, this beat, you know. Ba-na-na, da-da-da, and I feel it from my head to my toes. And it gives me-- It gives me power. You know, now that you remind me, I-I-I think I had that feeling once. Yes. It was great. I loved it ! It was-- It was wonderful. Yeah. - Now that you remind me, that's it. - See, that's it ! That's my life ! I can't live without that, Dad. Wow ! That is interesting. I-I'm gonna pass that information along to your mother.

Back to the station. [ Crying ] [ Crying ] I am here today to tell you... that rock and roll is evil. It's dangerous. It works on the libido. It's a nasty temptation, and furthermore, it's too loud. We are asking this television station to be a pioneer, to be the first on the air to vow to never again... allow rock and roll to be broadcast on the airways. [ Knocking ] Who is it ? Your best pal. Oh, yeah. I see you know how to keep yourself on the front page. Oh, yeah. Whenever I need attention, I just get myself arrested. You got chocolate on your mouth, Eddie. Yeah ? Mm-hmm. You got it. What do you want ? I got a way to get everybody in this city to watch your show. [ Sighs ] And as a bonus, make myself very rich and famous. Oh, I don't know if I want to know your way. Don't I recall firing you ? Now, just hear me out. You know those screwballs you got on the channel right now ? Already I don't like your way. No, you're gonna love this. Now, you and I both know that rock and roll is no more sexual than a Frank Sinatra song, and we both made it through puberty unharmed, right ? Well, maybe you didn't, but-- That's a joke, Lipsky. Now, I'd like to use the American justice system... to show what people think of rock and roll. Let's put on a trial. Right here at the station. We get a prosecutor, we get a defender, and we let the American people vote by phone. I can see all the publicity, can't you ? Court television. Court television ? [ Gavel Pounds ] I, Judge Patrick Eugene Boone, officially declare this court now in session. Thanks, Judge. Hey, hey, hey ! Is everybody ready to plead the fifth ? And that's not Beethoven's. [ Audience ] Ready ! Boy, have we got an exciting hour for you this afternoon. Yes ! We got conflict, we have love, we have hate, we have suspense, but best of all, we got music. [ Audience ] Yeah ! Kapow ! Now listen up while we get ready to embark on a highly irregular procedure. We're going to put a form of music, specifically rock and roll, on trial. Now is this a free country ? [ Audience ] Yeah ! So why should music be left up to one man or one kid's opinion ? Or should parents be allowed to censor this music in their own homes... and remove it from the airways ? [ Audience ] Boo ! Now with this trial, the jury is you people at home. You see these jurors in the juror box ? They represent you. That's right. So at the end of this so-called trial, you call in your decisions, we tally the results and then, voila, rock and roll, guilty or innocent. You be the judge ! All right. Is everybody ready ? [ Audience ] Yeah ! But first, if you wanna be the proud owner of a brand-new Cadillac... with just ten dollars down, listen to this. [ Man ] And we're clear. I feel like [ Sighs ] Della Street. Her hair is always so perfect. Yeah, well, I don't feel so good about this. Me neither. [ Man ] Three, two, one. Air. - Take it away, Judgey-doodle. - Thank you. The prosecution may now call his, uh, her first witness. Thank you, Judge Boone. I'd like to call Danny Klay to the stand. Kapow ! I swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but. Mr. Klay, where were you at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday night ? Well, I was at Woo Chow Fun's, like everybody else. Any more questions ? Yes. What was your function there ? My functiwas to let people know about the music these kids are playing... and help them raise money so they had a place to play it in. - Yea ! - Thanks, Danny. Did it ever occur to you that the parents of these children... might not be in support of this music ? Objection ! Can I do that ? Can I object ? I'm a witness and a defender. Yeah, you can do that, but your objection is overruled. Oh-h-h-h ! Uh, can I get a cup of coffee and some of that famous peach cobbler ? Shh ! Can't you see we're watching TV ? Excuse me, but does the sign outside say restaurant ? We're a restaurant after the show. [ Woman On TV ] Who was the leader of this destruction ? [ Danny ] Leader ? [ Woman On TV ] I think it was you. What are you watching ? My daughter. And my niece. Here, have a seat. Isn't it true that you spent three years in the detention center, and the other night you were arrested for inciting a riot ? Hey, uh, I'm not on trial here. I would like to object again, Your Honor. It is a little out of line, Mrs. Togar. How is this relevant ? I want to show the character of the man who is supposed to be a role model for our children, yet he leads them somewhere other than church and home. But what does this have to do with the music ? Hey, that's a good point. Let me show you, Your Honor. Ladies. I am going to prove that this music is a drug, a very addictive drug that controls your mind and your body... and puts you in a state of unrelenting ecstasy. - Where can I get some ? - [ Laughing ] Notice these children: healthy, normal, all-American. Now. Observe. ♪ Ah-h-h-h ♪ [ Record Scratches ] By stopping the music, we can carefully examine what happens during a rock-and-roll song. Some of you may want to turn your sets off... because what I am about to show you is shocking. This is grinding. - [ Laughs ] - Grinding. Think about it. If I have offended anyone, I am sorry. Judge, I would like to call to the stand a victim of rock and roll: Margo Doyle. Do you love your daughter, Mrs. Doyle ? More than anything. How has the music changed your life ? It changed everything. All my life I wanted a little girl that I could dress up and show off. And for years I had that. She was a wonderful little girl. She loved school and playtime and putting on my makeup. And now I can't talk to her anymore. All she wants to do is listen to that music... and express herself. She's 17. What could she possibly have to express ? She has a wonderful house and great clothes. Why can't she just be content ? It's that music. [ Crying ] I rest my case, Your Honor. [ Crying Continues ] [ Judge ] The public defender may call his first witness. Thank you, Your Honor-doodle-you. Okay, this trial is being done in a show business style, right ? Right ! So my clients would like to plead their case... in that show business style. Okay, are we ready to break a leg, clients ? Yeah ! Kapow ! Come on down, okay ? Yeah. I hope that means that the show is over. No, no, no. That means my daughter is about to sing now. Would you just watch the show ? You don't need any coffee anyway. It'll stunt your growth. I'm full grown ! And I want some coffee and some pie ! No, no. Wa-wa-wait a minute. Come on now. Come on. As soon as this is over, I'm gonna make you some food. I promise. Sit down, baby. Come on.

Let me see that. Are you really from Scepter Records ? The home of the Shirelles Scepter ? Yeah. [ Laughs ] One cup of coffee coming up ! And how would you like some ice cream to go with that peach cobbler ? Ladies and gentlemen, the verdict has been reached. You, the jury, have found rock and roll to be... ♪ [ Drumroll ] not guilty.

Whoa there, Mr. Klay. You're just the announcer. I'm the judge. It seems that since we were unable to see the faces of the jurors, according to the tabulators, some people may have voted more than once. [ Audience Protesting ] It is therefore the decision of the court to overturn the vote. - [ Protesting ] - You can't do this ! This is my show. They can't do that ! Oh, yes, they can. They've done it before. [ Audience Booing ] This court finds rock and roll guilty. No ! No ! That's not fair ! No. That's wrong. Boo ! That's wrong. Boo !
