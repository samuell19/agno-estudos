The thing is, your grandpa was sick and he kept forgetting everything. And I do mean everything, his name, his address, where he was. He even forgot I was his daughter. Then one day, I entered his room to watch some ships in a bottle he had. He was fond of collecting those. So when he walked in he started screaming, calling me a thief and telling me to stay put. I found that funny and broke out in laughter. He got so mad at my laughter, so he took one of his bottles and smashed it over my head, then I ducked for cover and when the glass shards fell and made some noise I saw some blood. I thought he might have cut himself, so I checked him up but he didn't have any wounds. That's when I realized I was the one who got a cut, when I checked I could even see the muscle covered in blood. Mom. - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! - Mom! We already memorized the lessons.
