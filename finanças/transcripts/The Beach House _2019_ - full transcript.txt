He's still working on it. Never seems to finish. No one's been here in months. Season doesn't really start until Memorial Day. Looks like we have the whole neighborhood to ourselves. Hey... I've been thinking about this, like, you have no idea. I missed you. So, uh, what do you want to do? Where are you going? I'm just going to run to the restroom. I'll be back in a sec. You know, it's not bad here in, like, January, February. Yeah? Well... I was thinking that maybe we could live here, like year-round. I mean, the house is just sitting here empty. It's such a waste. Well, what about my grad school? Can't that wait? I mean, that's, like years. I mean, it's such bullshit. You know it is. No, not really. Think about it. It'd be a vacation all the time. Isn't that what we want? Don't be scared. Randall, get up. Someone's here. - What? - Someone's in the house. Well, that's impossible. - No one should be here. - Well, they're downstairs. - Get dressed. - Who is it? I don't know. Some woman. Perfect. She was right there. Hello? Jesus! Who are you? What are you doing in my house? Your house? Doc never said anyone was gonna be here. You spoke to my father? You're Randy? Oh, you got so big. I haven't seen you since... Mm... It's been years. We stayed here with your family. Jane, honey, sorry I took so long. The nearest open store is an hour away. Well... It's Randy. Doc's son. Is that right? Well, Randall now. Well, Randall. Mitch Turner. You've met my wife Jane. It's good to see you. I taught with Doc at Brighton High, maybe, uh, 20 years ago. And you are? Uh, sorry, I'm Emily. Emily Kirk. I'm Randall's girlfriend. Oh, it's very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm so sorry about this. We don't want to ruin your weekend. We can, uh, go to a hotel, or... We don't want to impose or anything. No, we're only in one bedroom. There's plenty of space. It'd be so great to have dinner with you tonight. I'm kind of a grill master, at least Jane says so. He is. Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Thank you. Uh... Randall, I'm gonna go get the bags... Okay. ...from the car. I'll be there in a minute. Excuse me. So who are they? Some old friends of my father, it seems. They obviously spoke to Doc before coming here. Did you happen to tell him that we were gonna be here? Things have been strained between us lately. It's not my fault. Of course. You know, I thought it would be a good idea to come here with you and straighten some things out. And now it's not? I'm serious. You know, I... I thought we were good. And then you leave school, you leave me. No calls, some cryptic emails. I mean, are you kidding me? And now, here we are, back at it again like nothing's changed. And we could have gone somewhere else. We could have gone anywhere. Emily... I fucked up. I wanted to be here with you, that's all. So they're here. We'll figure it out. We have time. I promise. It'll be fine, okay? Okay. I do love you, you know. I love you, too. And here comes this three-year-old kid who wouldn't eat anything we made, just scarfing down these oysters. I think I puked my brains out. You liked them. No oysters tonight? Fine. For old times' sake. Yeah, um... I think I liked them more when I didn't know any better. I'm not even going to attempt that. Mm-mmm, not for me. It's an acquired taste. Yeah. My idea of the beach is a book and a blanket. Not shellfish. What are you studying at school, Emily? Organic chemistry. I'm finishing up my third year. Five more weeks. Chemistry? That's... That's an ambitious major. Yeah, yeah. I, um... I did it as a bit of a challenge to myself. I figured I could study anything after four years of chemistry. - You thinking about grad school? - Yeah. I want to study astrobiology at the University of Washington. They have a great program. What is that? Life on other planets? Kind of. It actually has more to do with life on this planet. How organisms can adapt to extreme environments that we could not even survive. It's, um... It's the point where chemistry becomes biology. Somewhere at the bottom of the ocean, we think. Life is so fragile. We're the right combination of elements. The right temperature. The right distance from the sun. And this measure of time spent developing and changing. Billions of years. One thing slightly off, and we would be nothing. Dust or gas or something. I'm in awe of it. Over my head. Randall, how'd you end up with someone so smart? Lucky, I guess. Randall, what are you studying at college? Um... Well, I'm not really there now. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I just... I'd had it with school. I needed to get away, you know? Doc probably wasn't thrilled with that. No. No, he was not. Things are a little different now, with college. Like, they're farming graduates. I didn't want what school offered, what the rest of my life was gonna be. I mean, it's like, what am I learning? What's the point of an education? Just to... to get a job? I mean, there has to be something else, right? What's underneath all of this? The... The marriage, kids, taxes, bills, watching television, elections, sports on Sunday. Careful. I coached a state champion baseball team. Look, no offense. I just don't know. You know, I'm figuring it out. For me. Well, it's complicated. I just wouldn't write off everyone who thinks differently than you do. You should be thankful that you have the time to do whatever you want. It... It is nice to hear... that spirit. We are so fortunate to be here with you. It's just... It's just so nice. Well, uh, does anyone need a refill? Yes, please. Uh-oh. Bad news. Are we out? Last bottle of chardonnay. Half-empty. Doc doesn't have any bottles stashed away anywhere? I could use a little whiskey. No. Nothing's open this time of night. Well, and we shouldn't be driving anyway. There is something else. - Mr. Turner. - "Mitch," please. Mitch, Jane... are you familiar with edibles? Randall... Times being what they are, legalization and all. I don't think this is appropriate. Well, it's only polite to share. Edible marijuana? Is that what you mean? Are you fucking insane? What? I got them at a dispensary before I picked you up. They even said that most of the customers are, like, 50, 60 years old. This is a really bad idea, Randall. What's he gonna do, tell my dad? She's medicated. It'll probably do her some good. I don't think it's a good idea. You already ate. We're not gonna be driving. Okay. How strong are they? They'll be fine. Randall? Do we cut it in quarters? So wait, tell me about this astrobiology? Well, it's like the origins of life on Earth. As we study the basic building blocks of life on other planets, it helps us with our origins. Finding any evidence of water is a good start. Didn't they just find water on Mars? Uh, yeah, kind of. Very recently. It's like, there are these very basic elements that were present at the earliest stages of the planet, and the heat from the from the core of the earth, it kept churning these elements for millions and millions of years. Evaporating, hardening... The atmosphere is, like, steam from water hitting a hot rock. But it's like something foreign had to enter the environment for nucleic acids to form. That initial drop, where did it come from? And then it started reacting, replicating, into what would become the bottom of the ocean. Soft water. I'm getting my diver's certification, so I can go on deep-sea studies... in some of the most inhospitable places on the planet. If we can find organisms that could live in such harsh conditions here, then... Oh, like an alien planet. I mean... I guess. All other planets are too harsh for life as we know it. We are the exception. We're delicate. What would it have looked like? What? Our planet. The surface back then. I don't know. Swirling gases. Unstable. Boiling. Chaos. Hm. It's so beautiful. Randall, have you seen this out here before? No way. Super trippy. It's all over. It's in the trees. Windswept microbes of some kind. Something in the air. Usually it's in the water. Oh, I want to see. You think you should? Oh, please, Mitchell. I'm fine. I'm having such a good time. Fine, fine. I think I need a new song. Mm. I'm sorry, I should have asked. With all your science... I know. I know it's stupid. I'll say. Randall hates it, too. I want to be a scientist, but I still do dumb shit. You okay, Mrs. Turner? Hmm? You feeling it? Oh, I'm just having so much fun. That music sounded alive. Yeah? That's awesome. It's gonna be amazing outside. You kids today, how you see the world. It's so different. All the information out there, it's... scary. No, don't... Don't be scared. It... The doors that could be open because of that information should... It should make life more beautiful. We're learning so much so fast. I think that's why I put my head down and focus on our baseball team. It kind of smells out here. You smell that? Yeah, I do. I wonder if sewage is backed up. I felt a little light-headed before. Have you seen my wife? Um... No, I haven't. She... She's very... I h... I have to look out for her. Yeah. I really... I really shouldn't have let her do this. Mitchell? Randall, get up. What? It's fine. It's not fine. Turn the music down. Randall, where did Jane go? Uh... Outside, I think? I need to find her. She went out the front door. Jane! It smells. That stuff's really strong. I think they're really fucked up. Who? Who do you think? This fog is insane. You smell that? What? I'm seeing sunspots. Jane! Relax. Jesus. Jane? Jane? Randall? What are you doing? I don't... I don't feel good. Randall? Hm? Randall... Hey, get up. It's past noon. How are you feeling? I'm fine. I feel like I'm still stoned. I have this horrible taste in my mouth. Is it hot out? I'm sweating. Yeah, it's hot out. It's beautiful, though. The fog's gone away. Should we go to the beach? Okay, I'm still a little fucked up. Yeah. They were a mess. Really? Yeah. She was throwing up. And you fell asleep. I didn't think they'd get so messed up. I thought they'd enjoy it. Really. Well, I'm... I'm glad I brought my suit. Mrs. Turner, how are you today? Um... You want some coffee? Are you okay? Do you need your medication? Your pills. Mrs. Turner, where's Mr. Turner? Where's Mitch? Mitch? Um, here, let me... Let me help you. Hello, Mrs. Turner. Um... Mitch! Mr. Turner! Let's go down. I don't think he's down here. No one is. Mitch! Mr. Turner! Mitch! Why would he leave her? Seems fucking shitty. I'm sure he's somewhere close. Can we sit down for a second? You okay? Yeah. It's just hot. And the air is so thick. Maybe he went swimming somewhere. You all right? Yeah, I'm gonna go back to the house. - Yeah? - Yeah, like right now. - Well, I'll come with you. - No, no, no, it's fine. I got to use the bathroom. It's a guy thing. - Will you check on Mrs. Turner? - Yeah. Sure. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'll be right back. Where is everyone? I've been wondering that. It was always so beautiful here, but this time... I don't know. Something is off. Oh, come on, now. What the fuck? Mr. Turner? Mitch? The thing we liked about coming here is, it was so comfortable. The same weather, the same rooms, the same furniture. They're frozen in time. Jane loved it so much. We hadn't been in so long, I just... I wanted her to have one last special time. She could be so happy on the beach. And when you see someone change in front of you... and you know it won't get any better, there's no going back. It scares me to death. How is she? We are so fortunate. It is so nice out today. Is everything okay? Fine, fine. Everything is fine. I think I'll go for a swim. Mr. Turner? Mitch! Mitch! Jane? Are you okay? Mrs. Turner? I'm coming inside. Tell me if you don't want me to. Mitch! Randall! Randall! Randall, where the fuck are you? Randall? Hey. Hey, stop. What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Hey. No, no. Hey, we have to go. We have to go, all right? Get up, get up, get up, get up. Where are your keys? - I don't have them. - What do you mean? They're not here! - God, what's wrong with her? - Go! Just go! - This way. - What? This way. Hello? Hello? We need help! Hello? I need a hospital. Oh, I'm fucked up. What is it? Is it your stomach? No, it's everything. What did she do to you? I tried to help her. It's like I was knocked out. I... I can't remember. We need a car. We need a car. We need to get out of here. We need help. What is going on? I don't know. - What is it? - Oh, fuck! I can't breathe. Look. Look. What is it? A flashing light. Somebody's gonna be there. They have to be. We got to go. Okay. Okay... Hello? Is this the police? Is there anybody there? We need help. We're... We're on Beach... Beachcomber Road. It's, um... It's near the bend. It's, uh... I don't... I don't know the address. ...hear you... near the water? Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's on the ocean. Your... Your car is here. It's number, um... Um, I don't know. I don't know the number. I don't know the number, but we need help. ...are extremely dangerous... What's extremely dangerous? ...exposed. Everyone exposed. Exposed to what? Get out of the car, get indoors, lock yourself in. Seal the windows. Don't breathe it. Breathe what? Is it the fog? It's not fog. What is it? What is it? Hello? Hello? Please answer. Hello? Randall? Randall! Randall. Are you okay? I was... I was thinking... maybe it wasn't such a great idea to come to the beach. Can you get up? Help! Okay, I need you to give me a second, okay? Just give me one second. Hey. Jesus! Sorry. I'm feeling worse. We need to get inside. I need you to cover your eyes, okay? Shit. Can you get in? Okay, come on. Come on. One... two... three. You okay? I'm all right. Are you okay? Are you all right? Look at me. Look at me. Are you okay? Hello? Em... Come on. Well, that's a good thing. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hello? Is anyone there? It smells like rotten eggs. What happened here? Nothing. Damn it! Car keys. Car keys. Car keys. They... They said it's not fog. Maybe... Maybe it's something from the water. An algae bloom. A chemical spill that's affecting the air. I... I don't know. We're fucked, right? Randall... Okay... Okay... It's okay. It's okay. Here. Here. What? The television. Uh-uh. I can feel it, like... churning inside. It's all the same. We're in fucking hell. The microbes have been preserved in rock. - What is that? - And the earth's heat free the bacterial form, - bubbling to the surface. - It's a... It's an AM station. Someone's out there. ...Oceanographic Research Institute, located 41 degrees north, 54 minutes, 67 seconds. We are fucked. Well, if somebody's broadcasting that, that mean that there are others. We should... We should lock ourselves in and seal the windows, and we could just wait until morning. I won't make that. No. I need you to hold on for me, okay? I can't do this by myself. I've... I've wasted so much time on shit. I'm scared. I'm so scared. It's okay. Look at me. Hey. We have to keep going. Oh, God. I'm here. And I'm not leaving you. Don't be scared. Okay? I need you to hold on for me. I'll try. ...don't expire when they succumb to the affliction. While life does not resemble what we have come to understand, a complex carbon-based form has become something else. ...until our planet becomes like all others, an extinction event to all current complex forms of life. Randall? We got to go now. There's something down there. No! No! Ah! Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared.
