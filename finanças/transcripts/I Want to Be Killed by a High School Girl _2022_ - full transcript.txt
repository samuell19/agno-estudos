What I want... I... What? Seriously, isn't that good? So cool! Aoi? Hey, did you guys see him?! Doesn't he look so cool?! I'm so sure that was our homeroom teacher! What? If so, that's insane! So insane! That guy is Yamasen's replacement, ain't he? Don't you think he's going to start messing with the girls too? Yukio, you gotta do that! What the Principal does. Do it, do it. "Well then! Mr. Yamaguchi has decided to quit school for personal reasons." Well then, I would like to say a few words to prepare you for the start of the new semester. Everyone, now that we welcome the new year, I wonder if you have set any new goals? What do you want to become? Are you alright, Aoi? I see. I need to attend the opening ceremony, so just rest here. Maho? What is it? Thank you. I'll see you later. Well, that's all from me. I will now introduce some of the teachers who will be teaching at our school starting today. Nice to meet you all. I am Haruto Higashiyama. I will be teaching Japanese History. As a teacher, it is my great pleasure to be assigned to Nitaka High School, which is one of the best preparatory schools in the area. We are looking forward to studying together with you in this nature-filled school building. As you all know, Nitaka City is a very attractive area where you can feel much closer to nature. And this city is also a land of many historically important sites, including the Nitaka Ruins. This town and Nitaka High School is one of the best places in Japan where you can study while feeling close to history. As a Japanese history teacher, this place is a dream come true for me! I will be taking over 2nd Year, Class C starting today. I think we will have a lot more involvement with everyone in Class C, and of course with the second year students. Everyone, I am pleased to be in your acquaintance. Apart from that, we have also received permission to establish a new club activity called the Ruins Research Club. I want to be killed. I want to be killed. I want to be killed. I transferred to this school in order to get killed. I... T O B E K I L L E D B Y A H I G H S C H O O I G I R L Translations by FURRITSUBS Morning! Morning, Higashi! Hey, Higashi! Look! I cut my fringes! Oh, you did. Looking good! You think? I do. Or did you only just notice? What? He didn't notice. Say I look cute! You look cute. That big one's going to die today. He looks healthy. Is he sick? Not sure. Then, let's bury it later. Hey! Seems like you're both being affectionate with each other again today! Here, thanks for this. What's this? The notebook you let me borrow. See you. Yes. A little longer? Aoi? Here. Thanks. Alright, let's start the class. Get back to your seats. The first battle that occurred after Tokimune refused to surrender was the Battle of Bun'ei. The Hakata Bay got attacked, but Yuan forces temporarily withdraw due to storms. In preparation for the next attack, the Shogunate built a stone fortification called a stone wall. Hey, about Aoi. She usually keeps going to the infirmary, but seems like she only attends History classes. Could it be that she likes Higashi... That's crazy! What a formidable rival. You guys, quiet down. Got it. These two battles are collectively called the Mongol invasion. Remember that. Maho, you're not going to karaoke? Sorry, I've got plans today. Really? Well, see you. Yeah, sorry. No way she's coming. Ready to go home? Hey, Aoi. Do you wanna join this with me? RECRUITING NEW MEMBERS This is a new club activity from this year to investigate the history and archaeological sites of the area and announce the research results in the activity once a week with the goal of making a presentation at the school festival. If you like geography or history, or want to know more about the local area and archaeological sites, please join us. It is a new club activity for this year. If you are interested, please see Higashiyama. Adviser - Haruto Higashiyama Aoi? Hey, what's wrong? Why do you want to join that? What? Oh, the club? I'm interested in the ruins of this town. Last year, I did research on the Nitaka Tomb for my free research. There are two theories as to when the Nitaka burial mound was built. One theory is that the characteristics of the clay figurines excavated from the moat place the date in the 5th century. The other is how a huge stone exposed on the top of the mound shows characteristic of the final stage of the Kofun period, possible that it is a ceiling stone of a side-mouth stone burial chamber, placing the date in the 7th century. That's amazing, Aoi! You wrote it. What? You remember it all? I'm joining. What? I'm joining the club with you. The characteristics of the earthenware excavated from this burial mound were similar to those excavated from the northeast. This pattern is exactly like that. That created the possibility that someone had traveled a very long way. Well, there's a possibility that it was bartered and distributed, but the amount of artifacts excavated would suggest that people moved into the area. Hey, Aoi. Could you be... Sorry, it's nothing. You're wrong. What? How do you feel, Maho? About Mr. Higashiyama. I think he's a good teacher, and he's kind. Hey, everybody's talking too loud. This is the staff room, alright? Teacher, what are you doing this Sunday? That has nothing to do with Japanese history at all. Do you have a girlfriend? I don't have one. Get back to your classrooms. Alright. Get back, you guys. Sorry about that, Mr. Ikushima. You may be famous among them, but you need to be a bit careful too. I'm sure you're curious as to why the teacher you followed after left the school. Committed lewd acts with a female student, yes? You're too loud. Well, since you're a man, I'm sure you understand. I don't really know why you would look at your students that way. Oh, really? Then I apologize. Seriously. I swear to all gods of heaven and earth that I have never looked at a female student as a sex object. So, when they forced that teacher Yamaguchi to retire, it was not only for his own sake, but it must also be brought with the help of some sort of sense of justice. A year ago, when I learned that she had enrolled at Nitaka High School, I applied for a transfer to Nitaka, but there were no openings in the teaching staff. However, after conducting a background check on the social studies teacher, I discovered that Yamaguchi was dating a female student and so I reported it anonymously to the school board. I was then assigned to fill that vacancy. I was even lucky enough to be her homeroom teacher. Sometimes God pushes the back of those who strive hard. Then, Katsuie Shibata was born in Owari Province in 1522. I was born in Gunma in 1987. What is your earliest memory? Let's see... Around my birth. The umbilical cord was entwined around my neck. I was on the verge of life and death. Do you have a memory of that? Oh, no. Just what my mother told me. But when I learned about it, it's like I have a memory of that time in some corner of my head. I remember it being a strange sensation. Can you share some more specific memories? My mother... I remember how she left me in front of a toy store. It's because I'm a bit of a spoiled brat. A concerned clerk let me in the store. Just as he was getting me a glass of juice, my mother came back. How did you feel that time? I thought she had really abandoned me. My mother kinda lets things take their own course. She was someone who felt cold to me at the time. The only reason I was so picky was because I wanted my mother pay attention to me. I didn't want any toys. What is it that you want the most right now? A thing? Like an object? Doesn't have to be a thing. Any desires you have. Desire? Back then, I still couldn't put my desires into words. No. I was afraid to put it into words. I didn't understand the reality of it. To be killed I want to get killed. Back in high school when I started thinking about my career path, whenever I see a pretty girl, I began to get assaulted by these feelings. This girl... "I want to be killed by this girl." "This is what you call a pervert." I was struggling with my own desires. "Autassassinophilia." Preference of getting excited by the idea of being killed, which is different from suicidal thoughts or self-mutilation. I was so interested in this psychology, which was still largely unexplored, that I decided to enter the Graduate School of Psychology and pursue a career as a clinical psychologist. I leave it to you. Thank you. By the time I'd become an intern at a university hospital, I'd realized that my desire to be killed had a clear target as its counterpart. I... I want to be killed by a high-school girl. The heck. It's you, Higashi! You startled me. Sorry. What are you writing? No, don't look. I won't. You sure? A script for the school festival class drama. It's customary for each 2nd Year classes to do a class play. Seems like it. Were you left in charge because you're in the theater club? If left alone, no one would write it. It's boring, choosing from a collection of plays. Also, I want to be the one to write it. They won't let me write some for the drama club because the director does it. So I said. I haven't come up with anything yet. You like theater plays, Higashi? I don't really hate "The Glass Menagerie." By Tennessee Williams?! Sorry. Also, "Emily's Lover." You know about it? It's a lesser-known play. Your image overlapped with Emily's and suddenly I remembered her. What? It's been made into a movie. You should watch it. Emily's... I'll make sure to watch it. The festival is on November 8. No time to slack around, huh? Yes, 8th of November. That day, I... will be killed by a high-school girl. The Hakeue heritage sites in this area are mainly from the Jomon period. There's a popular theory that the gorge is a cliff, and that it was a settlement of people who were chased away by a group of different cultures. Over there. It was said someone committed suicide over there 5 years ago. Just like that. A man and a woman held hands like that, and then they jumped off. Stop it, will you? You really know about it, Kawahara. Yeah, I prepped about it online. I heard it's a popular suicide spot. Seems like it. Suicide is active, of one's own volition, whereas my desire is passive. But the "pushed off a cliff" type of thing that can kill you with a single hit... No. The unknowing "drugged and killed to make it look like a charcoal-burning suicide" is just disgusting. Are you okay? Don't let go, watch your steps. Thank you so much. Scared? A bit. This place... There are documents that say it was a passageway between this world and the next. What? Before Buddhism came to Japan, how to deal with the spirits of the dead in the afterlife was an important issue. So it was thought that these places would become "corridors" during the summer and winter solstices, when time was out of balance. For them, the spirits of the dead are the ones they should communicate with. Death wasn't always something to be feared. An absolute requirement: It must be the perfect crime. There is no way the girl must pay for her sins for the sake of my desires. I'm afraid of death, too, so I want to resist with all my might and then be killed. In other words, I can only be killed by a girl who is stronger than me. I had to give up on my unrealizable fantasy, and I continued to suppress this desire and pretended to be normal. What is it that you want the most right now? A thing? Like an object? Doesn't have to be a thing. Any desires you have. Desire? You don't have anything? What I want... I... That's okay now. Now that's an example of a monster counselor by leading the counselor into a corner. I'm sorry. It is not the specifics that are important. Exchange places now. Yes. I wonder. When I looked at your face, I felt like there was something behind it. There's nothing in there. Sorry I didn't answer you properly. I would have wanted to know a bit more. So noisy, huh? Hey, wanna get out of here? I never felt any desire to be killed in her presence. I was just an ordinary man indulging in the pleasures of the flesh. It's alright. I can control this desire. So I thought. Not until I met Catherine. Asou. Present. Inoue. Present. And that girl, is in this classroom. Kinoshita. Present. Kimijima. Yes. Kosugi. Present. Sasaki. Present. Sawaki. Present. November 8th. I will be killed by her. It's so hot! I'm getting burnt! You can come in. I have anemia, too. I suddenly feel a bit dizzy. How about you? How are you feeling? I'm fine. You think you'll make it for 3rd period? It's Mr. Higashiyama, after all. It's coming. What? A big one? Minor. What? Something's shaking. What? I can't tell. Wait. Wait. Alright! Stop! Good boy. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. Catherine. What do you think? Really great. We're going with this for the school festival. Really? I'm glad! I watched the movie you recommended that day right away, so the moment I finished watching it, I thought, "This is it." I knew you'd like it. There's a scene that might be a bit too risky for high-school students to do, so let's both redo that part. You're playing the role of "Emily." What? Didn't I say so? Your image overlapped with that of Emily's. Hey. I was wondering if you'd like to give a sample performance of this? That's kinda embarrassing. Ready? Alright, go. Why... Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! It has to be you. Teacher, you call me by name when it's just the two of us. Don't want to? Not really. I don't hate it. Bye. See you. Aika! What are you up to? Nothing. What about you? What were you doing? What? A meeting with Higashi for the class play though. Oh, really? What is this? Do you like Higashi? What? Aren't you an idiot? Go, John! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Hurry and call the teacher! Teacher! There's a dog in here! Why is this here... Catherine? No. Catherine... I knew you were alive. Who's that? Someone else aside from Catherine? What was the purpose? According to the police, there's a good chance this incident was done by an outsider. You'll continue studying at home today, but try to leave with a group when you get home. Of course, the school will work with the police to strengthen security on the way to and from school and inside the school. Wearing a bandage? Kinda crazy, right? What? No way, right? Is it that kind of a thing? That hurts! A school with a dog murderer - Not sure, but if master it, you'll have a chance against a dog - Only for dogs lol - Shame on you. Start over in the next life - Is the culprit a Nitaka Judo club member? What a psychopath! - A school with a dog murderer - Apparently, it was rumored even in an online article - Fighting non-humans because you got too strong? lol You read too much action manga - Aika Sawaki from Nitaka High School: Why did you kill the dog? Damn you. - Culprit confirmed? Source? - Want me to send it to you? Is this true? That the culprit isn't a perverted criminal? Someone saw the guy dragging something across the schoolyard in the middle of the night. Seriously? Then, are those bandages supposed to be some kind of medal for fighting the dog? Maybe she got too strong that she wanted to fight non-humans. I'm sure this is a false alarm. What're they going to do? She must be getting bullied by her classmates. Like bullies being exposed on social media. That's scary! Eyewitness accounts and lies! Hey! Dog killer! This is bad! I'm going to be killed! Hey! Damn it! They're saying this is a school with a dog killer. This school is turning dangerous. You saw it? Come on! If you've got something to say, then say it straight to my face. What? What's this about? Woah, you're so scary! We're going to get killed! Oh, stop it, you guys! I don't believe all those rumors, you know? Acting innocent. Aren't you the one who spread it around? Come on, stop saying the weirdest stuff. I know everything! What? Isn't this violence? You're crazy! Shut up! Hey, stop it! Cut it out! There seem to be some strange rumors spreading about what happened here. Do you have any evidence to support this? Kinoshita. Someone saw Aika in the middle of the night. I was practicing alone in the park that night. The wrist is just a sprain. You've got no proof and you have the audacity to say so? You've got proof though? Stop messing around! Stop it. We have a witness. Namikidai Park, right? What? Yes. It's in my neighborhood. I see Sawaki practicing all the time over there. I don't want to interrupt so I didn't bother calling out to her. I saw her that night too on my way home from the convenience store. Enough already. You guys didn't seriously doubt Sawaki. It's a joint illusion created in an attempt to drown our insecurities. With an understanding of the horror of how the human mind can sometimes create demons, I want you all to apologize properly to Sawaki. Got that? Yes. That hurts. Good work. Teacher. This is really your neighborhood, I see. No way I'd lie about that. Well, I was home that night, so I didn't see it anything. Wouldn't that make it a lie? I know, but I had to say it. Thank you so much. A secret between us. Yes. Peer pressure can be scary. I wasn't sure how to deal with it, but then you spoke up. I should be the one thanking you. It's alright now. Everyone has apologized. You're so strong. But, at hard times, it'd make me feel a little better if you rely on me sometimes. Does it hurt? You can't do that. What if someone sees us around here? Will it bother you? Wouldn't it bother you? It won't. I've got all the characters gathered around. Catherine is alive. Contingencies have arisen, but there's still time. It should be resolved by the decisive date. November 8th. I will be killed by Catherine. Since the mysterious incident before the summer vacation, I know you are all anxious about your daily lives. In fact, many of our teachers have had students come to them with complaints of mental illness. We have decided to have a counselor come to our school starting this semester to help these students. I am pleased to meet everyone. I am Fukagawa, a clinical psychologist. "What is a school counselor? That doesn't concern me at all." Many people might think so. Isn't she pretty? She's so cute! Satsuki? Why is she... What? Haruto? Why are you here? Wait. You know each other? What? That's crazy! Totally crazy. Sorry. I'm sure you had it rough. I really did! I explained that we went to college together, so if they ask you about that too, just go with that. They were so persistent so I had to say it, that you're my ex-boyfriend. Really now? What a bum. Hiding something odd like this would make people want to trail after it. Well, yeah. But I was so surprised. I heard that someone was coming here as a counselor, but who would have thought it's you. Same here! You're a clinical psychologist now. Congrats. Thank you. And you really became a teacher now. I thought I was imagining things. I still don't get it to this day. You were still doing your internship at the hospital, and all of a sudden you said you wanted to be a teacher. Truth is, it was the kind of a job I've always looked up to. I'm still not convinced about how you suddenly broke up with me. I wonder why. I'm sure it's because I was still so young. Police investigations revealed that the man was killed by an 8-year-old girl who was at the scene. Investigators said the girl was home alone... I was watching that. Look at me! Things were going well between us. Not until I met that child. Miss, is it true that you used to date Mr. Higashiyama? Everyone keeps asking that, but that's a long time ago. Lasted for a short while. Who do you mean by "everyone"? I can't tell you that. Wait. This is not a counseling session. What's your concern? Something to do with "love"? I like someone. And that person probably likes me back too but... What should I do so I can confirm his feelings for me? You'll need to ask the person about that directly! But that's scary. I want to know without asking him. You mean, look at it without touching it? Like an X-ray? I think that's a bit too difficult. Because the heart is not an object. Then, what is it? That's it. The last question we always run into. Well then! What exactly is the heart? I don't know, okay? Right. I still don't understand why Haruto dumped me either. He dumped you? Let's keep this a secret. Secret? Might have cleared things up a little. Thank you so much. Let's keep it a secret between us that we talked about it. Got it. Then, I'll see you next time! Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Can I eat lunch with you guys? It's the truth! Really? It is! I have to say, you guys really do get along well. You're always together, makes me envy you guys. We've been friends since I moved to this town during the fourth grade. You're inseparable! Not gonna say anything? You've always been together?! You're so funny. Right, Aoi? She is. Then you should come to me for proper counseling next time. It looks like fun. What kind of conversations do you have with people? Mostly love affairs. Maybe because I'm old. Like about Mr. Higashiyama? Are you a fan of him too? No, I'm just... What are you saying? You're wonderful yourself, too! That's not true. You are wonderful. See? Okay? Yes. So? What do you think of Higashi, Aoi? Oh, so we've got those who don't like him too. You hate him? I don't know. Aoi? The one thing that all the girls who like Haruto have in common is that they all believe that they are the only one who is special to him. I don't think this is solely due to adolescent self-consciousness. It's like he's deliberately instilling those feelings and manipulating these girl's hearts. But, Maho Sasaki is different from them. She believes that for some reason, she doesn't deserve to like people. And perhaps Haruto is aware of this too. Maho Sasaki. Ayaka Suzuki. Ayaka Suzuki. Maho Sasaki. Finally... Maho Sasaki. Then, Maho Sasaki will play the role of "Catherine." You good with that, Sasaki? What? Well... I also thought you're a good fit for this role. Alright. Alright, next. The role of Sarah, Emily's bad friend who will deceive her. This is going to be difficult but rewarding. Do we have any candidates? If not, we'll vote again. Me. Oh, that's great. Then, Sawaki will be "Sarah." Alright. Next up, the boys. James who is both Emily and Catherine's lover. Any candidates? I'll do it! Well, let's see... What should we do? What? Can you not laugh about it, Satsuki? Sorry. So, how'd it go? No one wouldn't give it up so we had to play rock, scissors. And I lost. I said don't laugh over it! They thought I was aiming for Kyoko! But Yukio, you're for Maho, right? Of course. There's a scene where they hold hands. You know? I studied hard to get into the same high school as Maho. That's amazing of you. But the one Maho likes is Higashi, right? I would know because I've always been looking at her. Right. How sad. Hey, Satsuki. What do you think should I do? I think you're fine the way you are now. Just always exist near her. You don't realize it yourself, but she needs you to be direct with her. Seriously? Don't come near me! Just being around you makes me feel like I have bugs crawling all over me! Catherine, what the hell are you saying? I must... for Emily's sake... Alright, looking great! Very great! Next up. Catherine's funeral scene. Everyone's here except Maho. Alright. Catherine drank the poison. It's the mischief of fate. Come on! Kawahara, can you add more feelings in it?! That's your only dialogue! As if you didn't just learn about it, like the words were just born out from you at this very moment! Wait, and you're fine with Aoi's? Aoi's good. What?! Sarah, you lied to me, didn't you? That's right! But it's not my fault that Catherine died! You did it yourself! You murderer! Catherine... Why did you have to die? Catherine! Maho? Are you alright? You lied to me, didn't you? That's right! But it's not my fault that Catherine died! Hey, why are you here? Nothing special. I have an appointment for counseling after I finish this. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Appointment? I didn't see any form from you at all. You said I have to stay near her. I see. It's coming. A huge one. An earthquake is coming, Miss! Aoi's prophecy comes true! You guys, are you alright?! Are you okay? Maho! Are you hurt anywhere? You alright, Aoi? Are you okay? Hey. Maho? She isn't Maho. She's "Kaori". Kaori? Could it be... Nice to meet you, Kaori. You're not startled? I am. Right now, is Maho...? She's deep inside. I see. Hey, Kaori. Can I talk to you for a moment? No. "Maho" is coming back. Hey, wait. Kaori! Don't tell Maho about what just happened now. Hey, are you all okay? Hey, Sasaki? She's fine. Don't move her. Sasaki? You. What are you planning? I... I'm relieved. You passed out from the shock of the earthquake. Is that so? You scared the crap out of me. We'll need to borrow those exhibits for the festival, right? I'll be fine here. Go check it out. Let's go. As I thought, that girl... How're things over there? All good. I'm so glad I didn't unpack before! Alright, let's clean it all up now. How are you feeling now, Sasaki? I'm fine now. Do you often pass out? I'm a little anemic. Your necktie's crooked. It's alright. That was Kaori. Gotta be careful. We need to be cautious now. Shocking situation...! Strange strangulation case, suspect is unexpectedly an 8 year old girl with a strong will? Bizarre incident: Birth of a Superhuman Girl Back then, Haruto was unusually obsessed with a particular case. It's done. Stop that. What? Who's that kid? Well... A girl who is currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation at the training center. So studious. Let's eat. How did the strangler/superhuman girl come about!? Interview with a former detective, states she's a possible murder suspect At the time, this mysterious and bizarre case was making the headlines on both magazines and weekly newspapers. November 8, 2012. A woman living in a public housing complex in Hachioji returned home from a part-time job to find a stranger strangled to death with a cord in her living room. The deceased was an unemployed man who lived in the same public housing complex. Her only daughter who was eight years old, was found cowering in the bathroom. The little girl lost her memories of that incident. But as the police proceeded with their investigation, one absurd fact after another came to light. The girl's hands had marks on them from pulling hard on the cord, and her thin arms had clear marks of the victim's hand, which shows that he seemed to have resisted desperately. A number of circumstantial evidences suggested that the girl committed the crime. But how could an eight-year-old girl strangle a man of his stature? The investigators were baffled by the situation, which was hard to believe at first glance. Numerous pieces of evidence that came to light later determined that the man had entered the home for the purpose of playing a prank and was murdered by a girl who resisted his attempts. I... I have to say goodbye to you now. I have to grow up. I'm sorry, Kaori. I've been waiting for you. All this time. For you to grow up into a high-school girl. The first time I met you, I gasped at the beauty of it all. The fact that such a small girl like you could take on such a large man like that guy, it drove me crazy. Now, let's go down the white staircase, one step at a time. Go down slowly. Retrograde Hypnosis Results: It turns out you have more than one personality. Please open the door gently. Maho? No. You're not Maho? I'm not Maho. I'm Kaori. Kaori. How old are you, Kaori? How about you? Dissociative Identity Disorder Does "Maho" know about you, Kaori? I don't think she knows. We immediately identified "Kaori", 16 years old, with a strong personality. She was a personality you created to defend yourself against your father's abuse when you were still a child. "Kaori" is the name you gave to a doll you used to play with. Even after you mother divorced your father and the abuse stopped, "Kaori" still continued to foster inside you. Well then, Kaori. Was it you who did it? You're wrong! That guy was too strong. Even I couldn't do much about it. It was someone more animal-like and ferocious than I am. A girl named "Catherine" did it. That day, someone called out "Catherine." Over and over again. Catherine? A foreigner? This child. If what Kaori says is true, at the time of the incident, someone called out Catherine's name, which instantly created a new persona named "Catherine", and was the one who protected her. The TV in the room was turned on loudly at the time of the crime. It is assumed this was done to drown out the girl's screams. Estimated time of death: 3:00 PM. Estimated time of death... Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! I was sure of it. If it's you, as long as it's Catherine, she'll be able to kill me. However, your doctor decided that you had to take your time and slowly come to terms with your other personality, and so you were discharged. You left me right there. I quit my residency, went into teaching, and broke up with Satsuki. I want to be killed by Catherine now that she's a high school girl. On the day that the incident happened. That is, the day Catherine was born: November 8. The coincidence of this day being on a cultural festival is not a coincidence, but fate. 16 years old is still too young. 18 years old is already an adult. The last season to be a young girl is when you're 17 years old, and is the most glorious time to be a high school girl. When I saw you again, still, I felt uneasy. I wonder if Catherine is still alive inside you? In order to confirm that, I... Catherine is alive. Kimijima. Here. Kosugi. Here. Maho Sasaki. Here. A little while longer, Catherine. So, what do you mean? Hey, can you tell me about it? That day, Maho came home late because the teacher asked her to organize the exhibits. What? Aoi? You waited for me? Even when I said you can go home ahead? Sorry. It's fine. Thank you. I want to talk to you about that time in the past when you killed someone. Come to the back of the library. Kaori? Don't follow me. Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! That wasn't Maho nor Kaori. Kaori? Catherine... She saved me. Okay. It said it wants to die in its owner's place. And so you carried the dog over to Haruto's desk? What do you mean? It was Haruto's dog? That Haruto assaulted Maho? That's what the dog said? What for? I don't know. I smell a kind of death I've never smelled before from that teacher. Also, he's trying to do something to Maho. But, I can't really express it well. Because Maho likes him. The reason why you only attend his classes and joined his club... Was so you can protect Maho? Everyone kept saying that my drawings looked creepy. Maho said "It's beautiful." My school bag that they hid away. She would search for it with me until the sun went down. They would run away from me, saying they might catch my disease while chanting "Mime, mime." But Maho would hold hands with me. She would teach me the most beautiful songs. She said I was her friend. Maho is an angel. The words I write here will never reach you. We are pleased to inform all visitors: Today at 1:00 PM in the gymnasium, each sophomore class will present their class play. We hope you will come and see it. Teacher, look! Woah! It suits you! Right? I sewed it myself. That's amazing! Of course, that's not true. The heck! Hey, if you're gonna keep playing around, might as well match your lines with me. Yeah, coming. Good luck. Yeah. I need to talk to you. Come with me. Yeah, I have something to tell you too. Thanks. What'd you want to say? No, you go first. We gotta be quick. All their efforts will have been for nothing if we arrive late. You have "Autassassinophilia," right? Why do you think? 9 years ago. When you started acting strange, I suspected you were having an affair. I copied the content of that flash drive to my computer. It was filled with materials of a girl who had multiple personality connected to that Hachioji case. But, there was a text in a hidden folder that caught my attention. Inside it were text written by a man who had a desire to be killed I will be killed by Catherine 9 years later. By a high school girl named "Catherine". To think you had such fantasies. I thought, maybe you're a pedophile. I have tried to forget you. But just like this, we got reunited. I wonder which fate brought us together, yours or mine. I realized it too late. Those weren't fantasies. You... You're trying to get Maho Sasaki to kill you. You're remarkable. It's your turn. Nah, you already told me everything I wanted to tell you. My unfinished story that you read was then rewritten many times before I finally completed it. You chose this school as the setting and turned the students into characters in your own story. You're one of the important parts of this too. I know you're asking for help, deep down inside you. Someone who loves you might be able to stop your desires. I'm sure you wish for that somewhere inside you. Either that or... But, I already knew that those girls couldn't play that role. A young girl's love is fleeting. I need to go now. You can't. Don't stand up. The curtain can't come up without me. I won't let you go. I will cure what ails you. Well, hurry up, then. First, regressive hypnosis? We can't do it immediately. It'll need time to work. Then I'll do it. Just relax. Imagine a white staircase in front of you. Stop fucking around. Keep going. Just hear me out. Everything that's going to happen is inside this. In case my plan fails, if there is anything that could bring Maho Sasaki under suspicion, make everything in that drive public, and save her. Got that? Teacher! Where did you go off? We thought you'd never make it. A very important errand I had to do. Alright, it's showtime! Let's all hang tight! Yes! We are pleased to announce that 2nd Year, Class 2 will perform their play any moment now. The performance is by English playwright Miranda Brant: "Emily's Lover." Please enjoy it to the very end. What? What? What's wrong? It won't open. What? Calm down, you guys. It's probably an electrical malfunction. I'll take care of it. Just announce that they'll have to wait a little longer. Alright. A quick announcement to all our viewers. We are currently experiencing a trouble with the stage curtain. Please hold for a while. Aika, help me out. What? Alright. I can't get the winch to turn. Let's open it manually for now. Okay. Ready, go! Ready, go! It's moving! Get the song ready. Got that. Thank you for waiting! The show will begin now. Thanks, Aika. No problem. Gotta get down for your appearance. Yes. Thank you, thank you! You all did great, everyone! You did well again today, Catherine! Thank you, Sarah! All thanks to you. Catherine, thank you for everything. I feel the fatigue recede. I'm happy when everyone is smiling. You are the best instrumentalist in this town, Catherine! Do you mean, the best in this country? Oh, stop it, will you! What's your name? Me? I'm Catherine. Catherine? It was a very great performance. Teacher, did it work out? Yeah. I hooked up the fuse. It's all good now. Once they electrically wind up the now loose cord during the curtain call, the rest will follow through as usual. No... Haruto... You can't... Satsuki? Yukio? Why are you here? Aoi said you're in danger. Where's Maho? Up on stage. I fell in love with you! You cannot! You are Emily's lover! Catherine, we are both destined to be together! From the first time I saw you in the castle, I knew there's no turning back now. Teacher... Do you like... Sasaki? No. I... I must... for Emily's sake... Teacher? I... Catherine has now completed her long ministry here on earth and has gone to heaven. Sorry. Not at all. Kaori. I guess Maho won't return for some time, right? You... What do you want to do? Let's talk upstairs. You wouldn't want them to see you the way you are now. I called you here because I don't want Maho to know about what's going to happen. I don't want to cause troubles for her. Soon you will turn into Catherine, and you will strangle me with this cord. When the play is over, the cord will get hoisted up and as a result, this will be treated as a pathetic accident of a teacher just trying to fix a malfunctioning curtain. All the students who love me will become the witnesses. If it all comes out, Satsuki already knows the truth. I doubt Maho will be charged with any crime. After Catherine kills me, Kaori will come back up. Once she leaves this place, Maho will return. Just like what happened that time. Kaori. Your principle of action, your raison d'etre, is to not give Maho any psychological shock, right? November 8. Nine years ago, the day Catherine was born. This is the last and best stage of my life that I have created! Why do you want to do it that badly? I just... By Catherine... I just want to be killed by a high-school girl! But it's not my fault that Catherine died! You did it yourself! You murderer! Stop it, Sarah! Catherine! Why did you have to die? Catherine! Why? Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! This is... My... All that I ever wanted... The words I write here will never reach you. Still, as your teacher, I would like to say one last thing to you. Man must not take the life God has given them for granted. In other words, do not die in vain. As to how you live your life, and how you want it to end, I want you to remember that it is yourselves who can decide that. How you die the way you want determines the value of your life. One has to live for that purpose. If we believe that the cause of death of all human beings is "birth", then death is the proof of life, the completion of that human being. I hope you all live the rest of your lives to the fullest so that you too can die a happy death. Because that is the fate of those who have been given life. I just enjoyed every day I could spend with everyone. I'm sorry. My lady, we all had fun too. Maho? Maho. Maho! Maho! Maho. Maho! Run, Maho! Over there! Maho? Maho? Let me go. Stay out of my way! Stay still, you maniac! I'm not a maniac! I just want to be killed! I won't let you do that to Maho! If you want it so bad, then I'll do it! You're not good enough. You're no good! It has to be a high school girl! I knew it, you're just a pervert! Maho! Her personalities are in conflict. We're in danger of having Catherine and Kaori out at the same time! Maho? Maho? Where's Maho?! Where's Maho? If Kaori and Catherine continue to merge, the frail Maho will not be able to come back! Disappear! Can you two just disappear? You already have me, Maho. I will protect you, Maho! More than Kaori and Catherine could! More than that teacher could. I love you so much, and more! Hey...! If you don't even love Maho more than I could, then disappear! Everyone, just vanish! Get lost! Aoi? Catherine! Catherine! That hurt! You bastard, hold up! Catherine! Catherine! You need to disappear too! Get out of my sight! Catherine, I love you! Teacher! Move, make way! Excuse me. Feeling better? Yes. Is everything all right? I'm a teacher and I was brought in here after an accident during a school event. You remember? Not really. It's just what I heard from you. Right. Who are you? Do you already know me from way back? I wonder. Please do your best in regaining your memories. I want you to look at this today. I was born in Gunma in 1987. Is this... me? I look young here. The umbilical cord was entwined around my neck. Remember. I will bring you back to life as you were before, I swear. That is my redemption for not being aware of your anguish. What are we talking about in here? You'll know. Just keep watching. Now... What exactly is the heart? It was Nobutada Oda and Nobukatsu Oda in their central region vassals. It wasn't Nobuo. It's Nobukatsu Oda. Nagayoshi Mori, Kawajiri Hidetaka. This Kawajiri Hidetaka is a very brilliant man, and would have been very famous by now if not for the Honnoji Incident. Even historians say he's forgotten warlord. Hey! You need to pay attention. You're taking the test next year. Sawaki, I heard you liked Higashiyama? Oh, you wanna get beat up again? Yeah! Wait for me! Kyoko? A thing? Like an object? Doesn't have to be a thing. Any desires you have. Desire? What I want... I... I... Good afternoon. Everyone's so cold-hearted. They were only thrilled to come visit him at the start. Hey. Maho really knows nothing, huh? Only Kaori and Catherine knows. Listen. You know, I'm going to confess my feelings to Maho. You think it'll go well? No one would know the answer to that. The heck. We're still doing well at the Ruins Research Club even without you. There are only three of us, though. I'm going home now. What? Okay. I liked you, Teacher. What? Well... Please visit again. Sure. I see. I... I...
