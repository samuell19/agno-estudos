Would you stop that bloody racket! It's only two thirty! What? You've got some nerve showing up. Whenever I call nothing happens but if those bloody vagrants upstairs complain, you're here in a flash? I… It was agreed musical instruments could only be played on weekdays between three and five and after eleven on weekends. There's been some sort of misunderstanding. -No! It's twenty-five to three. Bloody slope's like a music box, plays the same bloody tune over and over, like she's retarded. Only knows a single song. I was supposed to give you this. Really? Are those bleeders suing me? No, it's not... My name is Björn and I'm here on behalf of the Ministry for the Environment... There's been a slight misunderstanding. On behalf of who, did you say? The Ministry for the Environment. I'm here about the tree in the garden. My Laburnum? Yes. God almighty... I'm terribly sorry, Björn. You know, there's been so much going on around here. Come in, please. No, I wasn't going to stop. You have to forgive me, I'm not normally like this. Come on in. The Ministry for the Environment, how wonderful. When we moved in here I told myself I'd plant something for the future. Something beautiful to make this bleak neighbourhood more liveable. If you talk gently to a plant and give it love, it'll blossom. Negative people can't grow anything. No… No. Yes, this garden has given me hour upon hour of joy. I don't mean to brag, but I wasn't the least bit surprised when I got the award back in the day. Dear me, I'm so sorry, blabbing away like that. Can I offer you some refreshment to take the edge of this awful heat? No thank you. Oh, but I insist. I can't offer you any beer though, there's no alcohol consumed here. Perhaps, just a glass of water. You should come back later in autumn. You know, when the tree sheds its flowers, it rains gold all over the garden. There you are. Thank you. I'm going to have a fag. It's one of my few vices, since it is such a special occasion. So tell me then, what's the news? Well I... God, I'm so excited. These kinds of visits aren't normally my responsibility. But my superior Þorvaldur Geir is off competing in a civil servants' golf tournament in Ireland, so- -Hang on! Let me just sit down there, under the old award. I've come here to inform you of a new regulation according to which any species of exotic flora not considered native to Iceland before the year 1900 will be subject to removal. You'll have three months in which to familiarize yourself with the details. The laburnum in your garden falls under these provisions. According to our sources, this species wasn't imported to Iceland until 1905. I think I've got the ending… This will have them pissing in their socks. Read it to me. "I therefore feel compelled to protest your envisaged plan. It is preposterous to award certificates one day, and then murder that same tree the next. I sincerely hope, dear Minister, that you will reconsider this matter. Yours truly and respectfully, signed Indiana Georgia Jónsdóttir". Followed by my social security number. I think that's fantastic. Wouldn't the world be a dull and boring place if there wasn't anything to complain about? Dearie me, you look absolutely spent after all that. Be a dear and pull one out of the ass for me. Could you light me up? I'm so knackered. It was real nice of you to come over, Johanna dear. Couldn't have gotten through it without you, absolute peach you are. It is in giving, that we receive. I expect Hjalti Petur to be back either side of the weekend. He's got trout fishing on Tuesday so it can't be any later than that. He should be here by now. I don't know what's keeping him. The attention deficit disorder clearly getting worse. "He hath need of his wits who wanders wide." That smells so good, Johanna dear. I put a pinch of curry in the flour. Curry? It's best to stick to recipes that work. Unnar's not much of a spice man. In fact, he's spice intolerant. I didn't put much at all, just a tiny taste to hint at the wider world. Plain and Icelandic works fine. I found this website with all kinds of award winning recipes. There was one from Vietnam. I showed it to Huong up on two, asking if she knew it and it turns out to be something she's been eating since a wee girl! That kind of cooking leaves such a dreadful stench out in the hallway. It's a bit like traveling the world. I've been abroad extensively and never smelled a pong like that. But it's fun to taste new things. They eat rats in China and I'm sure they do upstairs as well. But they're from Vietnam. So what? It's all the bloody same. I just say what my nan always said, “coat of many colours” and all that. "We're all flowers, each with our own colour. Flowers in the Lord's flower bed." Here I see... A small and very odd-looking little person. That'll be my Unnar, the shortie. No no, he's in here as well, this one's even shorter than he is. I'll bet it's one of my garden gnomes. There's something... I do wish that cloud wasn't quite so dark, stretching slightly into the future. Hi hi. Sorry I'm late. Were you out on a drill? No, we had some repairs, one of the cars had a broken gasket. We got called out yesterday. Oh, wow. You need to apologise to Johanna. She's gone to all this trouble making us dinner. Saving a human life's also important. -Unnar. Sorry. Guests first. Dig in darling. This hobby is taking up too much of your time. It's not a hobby mum, it's a lifestyle. And take that phone off the table, it's disruptive. But I need to hear if I'm called out. They wouldn't bother you at suppertime? Let me check for bones. Mom, I've got the whole squad waiting for me. At this table we respect what is laid out and eat calmly. It's delicious, Johanna. I spent fourteen hours up on a mountain yesterday. Fourteen hours? We were looking for that woman on the news. And was it you that found her? No, but I almost did. -That's just typical. I would have if I'd been in the First Responders. It's important to set attainable goals for oneself. First Responders? They're the first guys on the scene and can go above speed limits, like the police. I want you to observe the legal speed limit. I don't like you visible like this in public. You know we're being watched. Thanks very much. I'll be off, then. You never know what's going to happen, accidents don't come with advance warning. Exactly, so true. I'm a bit low on petrol right now. It's only Tuesday. Yeah, I know, but you can just shave a bit off next? Your pocket money needs to last the week. That's not easy to do. Your bedroom is always available should you decide to move back in. Living down in Engihjalli is just a short hop from the station house. Very well, go get the box. -Yes. I want you to go down to Jónas's house on Grettisgata. I'm in a hurry. -We must not keep the boy waiting. I'm going to be late, mum! -Go and fetch the bag. Lower cabinet. Let's have a look. Is he really so poorly as to need all that? Jónas is a wonderful lad, but the system has totally failed him. He's lucky to have a guardian angel like you. Have you done the washing yet? I did that for your mum, poor dear had a terrible migraine yesterday. Unnar dear. -Yes. Life isn't easy. But just remember, we tackle it together. Call me when you've finished up tonight. It'll be very late though. -I'd still prefer it if you called. And if Jónas should reward us with a token of his gratitude, you'll keep it safe. I'll do that. -Promise me. I promise. What's your name? Stop, stop. What is your name? Yes? Is Jónas home? They're asking for donations again. Hey man. -Hi. Give us just a sec. Now's not really a good time, got some mates round. I see. Same as last time? -Yes. Tell your mum hello, alright? You're too tanned. It's like you've just been to Costa del Sol. It was sunny up on the glacier. You're could throw our lives into disarray with this nonsense. You have to submit formally for a meeting with the Minister. This is an act of terrorism. Psychological terrorism. I planted that tree going through difficulties and having problems with my little Unnar. He was a very difficult child and always very ill. But I found solace taking care of that tree. It's my whole life. Don't you understand, if you take away that tree you'll be killing the little spark of life I have left. That tree and I are as one. It's the only thing keeping me functioning. Hiya, nan. Þórður was saying that my attention-deficit might be misdiagnosed. My supervisor at Search & Rescue. Anyway, he said I didn't have ADD any longer. Said it was something you can grow out of. He should know, a trained medic and got a medal from the president. The Ritalin doesn't work on me anymore. Jonas gets more out of it. Let go of me, woman. Daniela… (with thick Polish accent) Rúnar dear, what is problem? I don't understand a word this woman says. This is Ling, you remember... she only try to help. I want to go home, now. He think he is abroad. We'll leave from Fljótsdalur with the others, fully loaded. Let's take the night vision gear too, in case there's a midnight drill. Do we drive straight? -Yes. Then we walk to the shelter and get right to work leveling the landings and pitching the tents. The climbers can conduct their drills on Sunday afternoon. I'm told the ice is kinda thin but should be adequate. Yeah? If we're leaving town that late, might it be worth just spending the night in Akureyri and then drive to Dreki early next morning? -Sure. I don't think it matters much whether we get there late Friday or early Saturday. We would be more rested. These mountains aren't going anywhere. Thanks friend. If he sucked up to him any harder, he'd give the guy a prolapse. He's like forty years old. Unnar? -Yes? These two couldn't make it to introductions. Could you show them around a bit, maybe answer some questions? -Absolutely. Fantastic. I will leave you in Unnar’s very capable hands. Unnar. -Hi, I'm Stefan. I remember you from rest home, you visit your grandma. Yeah, that's right. Strange, I not think you are type for Search Rescue Squad. I'm a fully qualified member. In addition, we have a variety of specialized teams. Can I start right away? You can do our youth program. Once you turn eighteen, you'll be eligible as a rookie. What does a rookie do? Fundraising by selling fireworks, go to the national meeting… What are the attendance minimums? I've got table-tennis on weeknights. This is only for those willing to make Search & Rescue a lifestyle. If we go further down here we find the control centre. You think everyone can be Search & Rescue member? Not everyone. It's a question of having the time. Can be difficult if you have a family. What I need to do? I need to own much stuff? No, not anything too fancy, it just has to work. You take an introductory programme. After that, you can start specializing. I picked rock climbing so I can qualify as a First Responder. How about you, what are you good at? I have nursing degree from Poland. Specialty in rehabilitation and recovery from accident. Ligaments and help people who must learn to walk again. Okay. After eighteen months you take the recruit exams. Once you pass those, you're eligible to go out on calls. Exciting. -Yes. Are you in good shape? I walk very much. That's a big plus. Yes Hello? -Hi. Hi hi. Punctual as ever. Well yes. I feel like it's been ages. It's only been a week. So good to hear your voice. How are you, what have you been up to? One can only envy you teachers of those long summer vacations. I've just been pottering about the house really. I'm sure you're good with your hands. Oh, I manage. My Jeffrey, may he rest in peace, was very good at all that DIY stuff. I used to call him the "handy humanist". There's no shortage of chores when you've got an award-winning garden. Where are you? I'm just adding hot water to the bath. Just relaxing, slightly frazzled at the end of the day. I love going swimming. We've got a nice local pool out here. Always good to get some exercise and some fresh air. I'm thankful for my good health. I haven't been ill for as far back as I can remember. What? Are you alright? A silverfish just appeared here on the... the bathroom floor. Sorry, it startled me. -I was worried there for a moment. Could you hang on there a sec, Anton? -Sure. No problem. Sorry, I just got out of the bath. No problem. I'm going to dry my body on the evening breeze. You're... naked? Yes. There's no one here to peek at me. Not another soul for miles around. Well. I've been thinking... about us maybe meeting face-to-face. I... -I'm only two hours away. I'd be very glad for the company, but... Don't you ever get lonely? Yes, Lord knows there are moments. I'm just not ready to let someone in my life. I'm still in mourning, you see. I understand. But I feel you're with me when we talk. Your voice, it envelops me somehow. There's something about your disposition that reminds me of dear Jeffrey... Hi. -Hi. Hi, is your mum around? Hi, yeah. Mom, Johanna's here to see you. How are things, have you heard back from the US yet? No, not yet. Maybe this week. My my, how exciting. I'm sure you'll pass with flying colours. I hope so. Courage is like a muscle, it gets stronger with training. Just remember, it's us girls who hold up half the sky. Hello, Johanna. Oh dear, they grow up so fast. -Yes. I'm afraid I've come for the monthly fees. I transfer money this morning. -Lovely. They're quite comfortable. Not much good for outdoors but perfect for my indoor errands, so light. Glad you like. There is a piece of cake on the counter if you like. Unnar got some scraps from the Family Help Centre last Wednesday. There goes that bloody slope again. She has an exam at the end of the week. The nerve of that little- -Chi? Oh, she is so lovely. A right prodigy. Flew through her exams with top marks. Not in Icelandic, though? -Yes, she was born and raised here. But they speak Chinese at home. -No, Vietnamese. Imagine, only seventeen and already applied to a prestigious music school in the US. They're sending their child away? I don't understand these people. Well, her brother's already living there. How on earth do they find the money? They're so resourceful those Asians. They've managed to pay off their flat and put young Bao through university. They see further than their noses. It's remarkable. Is something wrong, dear? Can I get you water or your medicine? Your comments have been taken into consideration in view of your circumstances... An Icelandic tree instead? Well, that sounds exciting. A bloody birch? Those bloody politicians. I can't... As long as I'm standing I'll never let this happen! Not Icelandic..? How can they say this? I grew up with laburnums, my childhood was swarming with them. I'd give them another call and demand to talk to the Minister. Is the Police getting involved in this? -No? Cramming the bloody long arm of the law up my shaft over a bloody tree? I gave birth to an utter moron. He shouldn't be allowed... -A traffic violation? There goes the stipend for the car. It's from one of those hidden cameras. Is that in the tunnel? Doing sixty-three miles per hour? I've told him a thousand times... Is that really Unnar? -Yes, but he's laughing. At that speed? What could possibly be so funny? Maybe that person he's with? Is that a woman? Who could that be, it's not you? No. Oh my lord... It's the gnome I saw in the cup. I must answer, it's Soffia. Hello, Soffia. Yes, I can do that. I see you tomorrow. Bye. Hi... There there... It's ok. Oh well then... Come to me... come. One... Two... and... Yes, yes, yes... Up you go. Two kitty cats, kitty cats Tabby grey and sweet... What are you doing? Hello sweetheart, wonderful to see you. Is this your friend? Hello, nice to meet you. Welcome to my home. Hello. Daniela. Oh, an Orcidea. You didn't tell me she was such a dear? And you're about the same height. I'll put it by the south-facing window so it can grow and blossom in the sun. Orcidea needs so much care. Stiflingly hot today. Have a seat sweetie. Oh, is it..? So sorry. Oh, don't be silly, doesn't matter. Dear oh dear. That's a medicinal chair. -Oh yes, of course. Well, well... The two of you share the same hobby, At least he told me that. Lovely photo I got of the pair of you. Photo? -Yes... In the car. Oh that. (with thick accent) Yes, that not happen again. Very annoying, you drive fast and not see the camera. No flash, no anything! Unnar say to me you like plants and flowers. You have such green fingers, everything blooms around you. Yes. Mum knows a lot about flowers. -Oh, thank you. Very little flowers where I live in Hafnarfjörd. Hafnarfirði. Yes. I still have small problems with Icelandic. Is difficult language. Really, you think so? I don't. The grammar is difficult. She passed the first aid course with flying colours. Got the highest grade. Yes well, I have medical training. Is not difficult. She's mostly into the basecamp work. Logistics and stuff. Coocoo… A cuckoo, cuckoo. Hope I haven't missed anything? -This is Johanna, from upstairs. Johanna Einarsdóttir. Hi, Johanna. Daniela. Oh, how romantic, You are the gnome? Hello. It's so good for him. He really deserves it. You look a right couple you two. Alright, darling? Shall I get you something, put the coffee on? It's already in the pot. Just turn it on. -Sure. You're also on the Search & Rescue team? How long have you been..? -Well, it's... She came to the beginner's course. Unnar welcomed me the first time I came and meet me with Þórdur. Fellow with the medal? -Yes. Now Unnar soon becomes a First Responder. Very exciting. What do you call a First Responder in Polish again? It's a beautiful word. Also means "a man who sees into the future." The man who sees the future. Are you not Icelandic? I didn't realize she was a foreigner either. Took me a good while. Did you know, Indiana? Had Unnar already told you… She's been living here for almost seven years and hasn't been back to Poland since she moved. Are you from Poland? I'm from a small town outside Kraków called Miechów. Are you bringing the world to our door? Your Icelandic is so good. I try much to read, and can always talk to the old people. Unnar, a great girl you've got here. We've got some Poles in this building too, up in 3V. Bazyli and Bibiana. She is a translator. -Bibiana Piotrowski? Do you know her? We exchange recipes sometimes. She makes a delicious meat soup. I don't know her well. I just meet her once. "Met” You "met" her. What a small world we live in. Maybe I should go get her? You alright? The coffee… coming right up. Well well. I'm perfectly capable by myself. Are you alright, dear? I believe I just had a nervous breakdown. But you look good. -Thank you, dear. You have accident? -I've got spinal stenosis. They were going to operate on my spine once, but they gave up because of my fibromyalgia. I had a car accident when I was 19. Was thrown out of the car into a lamppost. Very unlucky. -Actually I'd say I was very lucky. That's how my nana and I chose to see it. Yes, she got a 100% disability because of it. But they're working hard on stem cell research so there's always hope. She's wonderful, Johanna is. Grew up here mid town. I have plenty of fish in the freezer if you want. Hjalti Pétur always brings some when ashore. Hjalti Pétur? -That's my boyfriend. It's awful nice to have you Gabriella. Unnar's friends are always welcome. Her name is Daniela, mom, with a "D". Sorry, I have such a problem remembering names. A touch of the old attention deficit disorder. Although not as much as my Unnar's. More coffee, dear? -No, thank you. Unnar and me are thinking of going on camping trip up glacier. Glacier? What about your asthma? I'll just bring the inhaler. Do you have asthma Unnar? Nah, or just a bit. I haven't had to use the inhaler for a while. Maybe it was just childhood asthma? It can easily flare up again. I've had clear patches in between. Childhood asthma? Is your family here with you? Both parents of mine are dead. Oh, how sad. -Thank you. But we are six sisters. Big family, all have many children and there is just... I'm youngest and have no husband, no children and live in Iceland. My sisters say: "What are you thinking?!" She's working on her citizenship. -Really? If everything goes well, after nine months. It will be a proud day in my life when I can show a passport that says: "Daniela Majok, Icelandic citizen". Good god! I've got this! Now, get up very carefully sweetheart. Johanna, get the first aid kit. There's one in the bathroom, another on my bedside table. I'm alright mum. Jesus! Are you okay? -Don’t! Goddamn it. Clumsy me... This is terrible, just terrible. Dear boy. Do something useful, lift his feet. -Mom... The footrest, woman! Haven't you ever seen a La-Z-Boy before? Mum, it's really okay, it's just a nosebleed. Just lie back, dear. You've not been taking your medication? You are on medication? Unnar has never been the full shilling. He hasn't told you about that? Full... shilling? This is a collection of pictures from our holiday's. I transfered it to a disc. -It will be fun to see. Cherish the good memories, forget the bad- Johanna dear. See what a darling little cutie he was. How old you were? Oh, five, almost six. That's us on our way to Spain. You so cute. Now, that's us at the airport at Costa Del. And that's the pool at Timor Sol, the hotel we stayed at the first seven years. Was it very cold then? -Not as I recall. But he's so heavily dressed? Yes, well, he caught a flu before we left. Cute cat. That was a stray that hung around the hotel. Unnar wanted to bring him home with us. Oh, how he cried. I've been thinking of getting a cat. -That would be fun. Cats don't thrive in a high rise, you know that. Unnar has always been very keen on animals, identifies with them or something. My poor little puppy. Mum... -What? Please don't call me that. What? Surely you don't want to keep secrets from your new friend? Mom- -He was just so cute... When I had just finished planting, soon after we moved here, there were lots of kids in the neighbourhood, with everybody out and about. But my little fellow had problems settling in because he could barely talk. So I sometimes sent him out if the weather was nice, fresh air was good for his asthma, and I told him to watch over the garden. Make sure no one climbed over the fence to traipse all over my precious seedling. One day a boy did clamber after a ball and my little fellow couldn't squeeze out a word. So he just barked. He barked at the kid! The whole neighbourhood was in hysterics. The kids called him "the little puppy" after that. Not everyone. No, but most did. I've sometimes called him that. He actually didn't learn to speak properly for ages. Strangers had great difficulty understanding him. Unnar was born prematurely, you see. Very? -Yes, very prematurely. Born with the umbilical cord wrapped three times around his neck, and suffered a lack of oxygen. -You must've feared for his life? I just took things as they came. He was very small at birth, and not expected to survive. It later became clear that he had ADHD to a very high degree, which I'm told is quite common among premature children. But you got disability benefits. That was a blessing. I suppose, I had to stay at home. It wasn't easy, couldn't leave him alone for a second. Now, that's the following year. Were you getting the travel subsidy by then? Yes, when I thought he had psoriasis. Later it turned out to be an allergy to the cold. You been up on glacier, there is no problem with cold? I have a sleeping bag withstanding minus 70 degrees. So, that's two or three years later. By then we'd moved over to Roc Flamingo. That's it? Wow. Yes, where we've stayed every year for the past 18 years. Wonderful location. Close to everything. And there's the swimming pool. That's Unnar waddling there at the edge. He never did swim much, due to his immune system. You wouldn't let me. You said there was a danger of infection from the psoriasis patients using the pool. Unnar? We didn't know any better then. No chlorine and the pools cold. This was off-season, you see. There was never any other children? -Not on the psoriasis trips. Most kids are still in school that time of year. But here... There you can see a few. This was as a trip for chronically ill children. They even had to alter the airplane to fit in special medical beds. Because of Unnar? -No, not because of him. There were children with heart and digestive diseases. A girl with a stoma bag... And that one, with the red towel, had leukemia. At least she got to use the pool. Her parents were all loopy. You remember, drank like sailors. Children can adapt to the most extreme of circumstances. Even bomb raids become the norm for children who grow up under such conditions. Unnar had such a crush on her. I told him there was no future in it. Like I said, she had leukemia. But he's maturing. You're the best thing he's dragged in here. Thanks. Unnar has always taken good care of his mother, I'll give him that. My health fluctuates to such a degree that I'd be lost without him. I'm not quite understanding... You have said nothing of this in three months? Are you handicapped? Sorry if I laugh. Is there something more you like to tell me? Do I have to unscrew your leg when we get home? Hello? -No. I was just born very premature. And then I have this fibromyalgia thing. You don't have fibromyalgia. You can't climb ice with fibromyalgia. I'm much better now. I think your allergy to cold much better now too. No rash on your skin when you drive up glacier with broken heater. You always take medication when I am not seeing? I haven't taken any medication in a long time. Not since I joined the team. You don't get it… If I'm not disabled we get much less money. Everything's become so expensive! Unnar, it is terrible to see. A mother cannot talk like this to her child. A mother should help her child to become a first responder in life. That's why I didn't want you to come here. You have not been telling me the truth. Is just stupid. -Yes. Sorry. Now I understand why. ...she said those pastries did not originate in Iceland. Imagine, first the meat soup, then the laburnum and now our cakes. Yes, I brought tortillas. -Yes. The kind you like. Feel free to offer some to the others. I made plenty. I also brought some plain fruit salad. You never know, all kinds of allergies these days. Her sisters are living all over Europe. The eldest is in Denmark and one in Estonia. One's married to a Czech man and the rest are still in Poland. So I guess you could say that they're all partial to foreign men. Do I hear wedding bells Hjalti? -Fuck off. You can't keep blaming the government for everything. Hi. Johanna Einardóttir. -Pálmi. Well sweetie. You just give me a ring. -Yup. Goodbye sweetie. It was clear what went on in your room. Sounded like the generator was busted! Shut the fuck up. Hjalti Pétur decided to have a pint with his mates, so I drove him to the pub. They're just chilling. It's so nice for them to spend time together outside of work. Under the weather today, darling? -Oh no, not at all. Perhaps a bit stressed from having Hjalti Pétur come ashore so suddenly. Had to do the shopping… and all that. Is he quite demanding then? With, you know what? How does that work, with your condition..? Well, we have our ways. You could say we pleasure each other. I don't like lying on my back, not for long. I hate to think of a friend suffering. -It has it's pros and cons. You get rid of certain tension, you know what I mean. Well, I'd best be off. My show's on telly soon. Hello there. -Hi. I'll be off, then. Hello, dear. Thanks for coming, darling. You know how hopeless I am at this sort of thing. You see what the problem is? -Same as last time. There's a cold Diet in the fridge if you're thirsty. The tube's come completely loose... Has it been like this for long? Three days. I didn't want to bother you. It's a right mess down here… It was our week vacuuming the hallway, I had to ask Johanna for help. I didn't feel up to it. Haven't been up to my usual, all my energy gone into sending letters, trying to save the laburnum. I can come over any time. -Oh thanks, you're a darling. What's the news? How's that friend of yours, Gabriella? Are you still... Her name is Daniela, mum. Is it serious, then? -No... How do you mean? I'm glad it's not serious. I could see right away that she wasn't the woman for you. Listen… I might not be able to go to Costa Del this year. The team is going on a important trip around those dates. She put you up to this. -No. Yes, she did. She's trying to wedge herself between us. Who's going to push my wheelchair at the airport? You know what I'm like after flying. -Lots of people can push a wheelchair. I have to get from Terminal C to Terminal A to catch the bus. Maybe Pedro can take some time off from the bar and give you a hand? Pedro..? And what am I supposed to do if you're not there with me? All by myself, surrounded by... psoriasis patients? Well, I've got to go. She's from a different culture. You'll never understand each other. I understand her perfectly. You can never be sure of her background. She could have a quite a past, you know. She has a degree from university! Really? Then why is she wiping old folk's asses? It's a totally different system over here. Isn't it sufficient proof that she's here under false pretences? She can't get her diploma accredited mom. -Rubbish! I wouldn't be surprised if she'd been delivered here through a mail-order catalogue. She works at an old folk's home! That's what they all do, during the day, then spend their nights gyrating a pole. You've seen how she looks, moves like a doe. Maybe we'll start a family… I'd like that. A person with ADHD and other disorders shouldn't have children. It's in the genes and gets passed on. Just look at my mother... A vegetable in a wheelchair. How does someone with ADHD climb the highest mountain? Well… You've always been accompanied by others- No! The world isn't like you say it is. People are good and don't judge me! Emergency! Good evening. -It is emergency! I'm a First Responder. Go on then. -Thank you. Yes, first one here! Barely six minutes from home. Who is it you call? -Mum, I’ll let her know. Doors! Good evening. It's a miracle that they're alive, the Dutch couple that survived a fall of over 30 metres down a crevice on the glacier earlier this morning. "I was sure these were my last moments" said the rescue worker who performed a heroic deed and thanks his colleagues for their support. Our reporter met the proud member of the first response team at the glacier this afternoon... Hanneke and Robin Buskirk were on the third day of their honeymoon when they got seperated from their group in heavy fog this morning. Following an extensive search a rescue helicopter was summoned to the scene. Unnar Jónsson was on board and without hesitation, lowered himself into the crevice in search of the young couple. The woman was badly hurt, both legs broken and barely conscious, I got her first and then went back for the man. Can you tell us how it unfolded? Nearby Search & Rescue were first on the scene, being the closest, but when we arrive... Indiana! Have you got your telly on?! -Not now, Johanna! Unnar's on television! Unnar made very little of his feat. Nah, you just do your best... What have you done..? I like to thank the head of the squad for his brilliant planning- Answer, boy! To be in Search & Rescue is a lifestyle more than anything... Voice mail... Unnar Jónsson, where are you?! Obviously it's unusual for someone with 90% disability to recover like this. To bounce back to full health after 28 years on benefits. Are you implying that I, in my wretched state, lied about my son's condition for money..? Do I look capable of doing a thing like that? Article 55 states, we have the right to reclaim benefits, if overpaid or obtained by fraudulent means, through erroneous information. And the beneficiary is obliged to repay the amount with interest. Johanna dear... Please give me a moment alone with the lawyer. Of course... Nice to meet you. The boy suffered a lack of oxygen when he was born. He was very small, even for a premature baby. He somehow... Throughout the whole pregnancy, I sensed something was wrong. And I was right, everything was... By the age of five, he behaved in a way that made me scared of him... his mood swings were so... Me, with all my disorders had trouble controlling him. Unnar's always gone his own way... I can never know what to expect when he walks in through the door. Can't know whether he's telling the truth or not, I've never been able to... It hasn't been easy for me. It sounds like he's psychopathic? You think? It may well be that he is. I'm no expert... But it's certainly not something I engrained in the child. No mother would ever want her child to be disabled, would she? Hi. I'm a little behind schedule. Are you in a rush? Yes... I... I've made plans. Althea can take care of you, if you don't mind… Althea. She's fantastic. Have you met her already? No. Or we could book another appointment? No... it should be fine. I have a schedule to keep. -Good. Go and have a seat. She wants pink with stones. -Sure. Hi -Hi. How are you? -Just fine. Good evening. What can I get you? -A Diet. No Ice. Thanks. -Cheers. Cheers. Excuse me, are you here alone? Yes. Are you possibly... Agnes? Agnes? Did we have a date? I'm Anton. No... I’m… My name's Indiana. Oh, I'm sorry... I'm waiting for someone. Her name's Agnes. You have a similar tone of voice. Blind date? I suppose you could say that. But we know each other well, spoken on the phone quite often. How romantic. I haven't had a drink in over two years. But here I am, on my third already. It's nerves, I suppose. Oh? It's not often you make a connection with a person. A real connection. But I don't have to tell you that. What do you mean? Oh, just... you look like someone who doesn't have that problem. I... She's probably been held up, busy woman that she is. She does charity work. Very selfless woman. She sounds interesting. -She is. I've often wondered what she might see in a man like me. I'm sure you have many qualities yourself. Not everybody would agree on that. It's good to get to know people over the phone. Looks don't get in the way and it makes it more honest. I haven't been entirely forthright with her, though. No, no one ever is. -No. Maybe she already arrived but left when she saw me. I'm sorry, got to run. Good luck. Thanks. Bye. I'm ready, you coming? Yes... It'll be fun, eh? Mum, open the door. I'm having a... I can't breathe... You don't know what you're doing to your own mother. Are you alright? If you don't answer I'll have to break down the door. Out of the way mum, I'm coming in. -No, no, no! Have you completely lost your mind? Are you- You know I find changes difficult... on account of my phobias. Yes, I know. Maybe we could bring some dessert? Yeah, we could bring some dessert? What? We'll have risalamande, as always on Christmas Eve. We respect Icelandic traditions. Yeah, we don't have to change anything. And malt and orange soda. -Yes. I hope I won't be in your way. Mom, don't be like that. -Yes... I'm just a nuisance. -No, no. Yes, I always am. -Mom... Things are great at work. Þórður's brother has offered me a contract. It helps a lot, so I can pay the benefits back. Unnar has gotten many praises after his rescue. He's become a national celebrity. -I'm no celebrity. I also saved a human life... but it wasn't on the news. Do you think you'd be sitting here if I hadn't sacrificed all my dreams to bring you up? You should be glad all is going well for Unnar. Of course I'm glad. All mothers are glad when their children do well. It's just all so new to me. I would have liked things to work out for me sooner. How’s… Esther Ýr? Your friend on Facebook. What are you on about? Are you going to deny it? Don't you know Esther Ýr? No I... How do you know that? Who is this… Esther Ýr? Wasn't she chatting with you? Yeah, just said she'd seen me on the news. And thought you were a real hunk. -She did not say that. Really? Maybe she used some other words. And you said she looked really good in her picture, in that low-necked top. How do you..? I know all about it. Your mother knows more than you know. Was I messaging you..? -Yes! I knew he'd jump at the chance of two-timing you if there was a nice Icelandic girl available. You are so pathetic! - I'm just protecting you, don't you understand? -No! You're a pathological liar! Why did you always hold me back? Never allowed me to do things like other kids, sports, be a boy scout… You were allowed to go on that first aid course. I just did that for you! Bjarni down the road has autoimmune disease but got to go to university. Now he's a computer programmer, with a teenage daughter! Are you implying that I was standing in the way of your happiness? You were a very sick child. - Mom..? How come I'm always sick with you, but never when I'm with her? I did everything in my power to protect you! I don't understand how you can be so bad? If you had put the same energy into growing this child as growing that tree, you would be a rich woman. Now listen here, just who in blazes do you think you are? He's 39 years old, will you never untie the umbilical cord wrapped three times around his neck? You barge in here, into my home and have the gall to judge me? What could you possibly know about the workings of Icelandic society? Not a bloody thing. You puffed-up Polack tart. How can you talk like this, with all this prejudice? Is it prejudice to want to defend one's own son? To prevent some parasite from exploiting him? You're nothing here, not even eligible for social benefits. I don't need benefits, I work for my wages! Yes, you're lucky to be healthy enough to wipe old men's asses. I hope someone take care of you when you are old lady. I have Unnar. -But soon you will not have Unnar You don't understand? We stop coming if you continue like this. I'm impared and you burst into my home with threats? Really? You really impared? Get out, this is my home. I know you are swindling the system all this time. I can tell about it. You make Unnar lie when he was just a little boy. Tell him to cry and say he doesn't know anything, when people ask. You don't know anything! Look at you... You look silly. What you so afraid of? I just want you to know, that this plant won't be getting another drop of water. Not a single ray of sunshine will ever fall on these delicate petals again. This plant will spend the rest of its days in darkness among the silverfish! This is what I do with gifts from the likes of you. I can pick up phone and tell about when I sat in a Subaru and met a man called Jónas… who lives on Grettisgata. And Jónas take bag with medicine and pay money. I hope we can be civilized in the future. You will always be welcome for a visit in Engihjalli. No plant will ever blossom in Engihjalli. Not a single plant. What are you doing? You have no business being here. I'll call the police. This is an invasion on my privacy! Ten more minutes and I’ll give the ham one final scoop. Then I'll whip the cream for the Waldorf just before we eat. Help yourself to another glass of sherry, dear, if you want. You're in good form today, skipping around like a little girl? Yes, I'm unusually good these days. I'm always a bit excited at Christmas. Did I forget the red cabbage? I made a Filipino papaya sauce that Dalsay taught me how to make. It's supposed to be quite good with meat. With glazed ham? Yes, nice to have something sweet with the salty. We're not going to risk that on Christmas Eve? Shall we just keep it in the fridge? Let's stick to the traditional this evening. It's also good to let it settle for 24 hours. We can try it with the leftovers. He normally helps me set the table and gets to open one gift before dinner. Unnar is such a Christmas boy. Since Hjalti Pétur stopped coming, I've been thinking it's time to do some traveling. You're better off, a nasty little man. Yes, I am somewhat glad. But I worry about the residents' association. I wouldn't like things going pear-shaped while I'm away. That's it, I think. The Christmas spoons and... God almighty, I forgot to wrap up the almond gift. Don't tell me what it is, I don't want to see it. Unnar always gets the almond gift. We just won't wrap it this time. It's late and he should be here any second now. Thank you Indiana for letting me into your life, for allowing me to participate in this hallowed moment. Salutations, dear friend. Wonderful to have you. "May the spirit of Christ bless your heart with these meagre tears." What would I do without you? My nan always had raw spiced salmon. Johanna dear. Let's listen to the silence. Sorry. Merry Christmas! Hi hi. Are you finally here? Dear boy. Merry Christmas. Are you alone? Yes… -Really? Nah! We have a surprise guest! -Look who's here. We bring Granny with us! Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas Daniela! Merry Christmas, Indiana. Is that your nan Unnar? -Yes. Well how about that. Very nice to meet you. Johanna Einarsdóttir, Indiana's friend and head of the resident's association. She is- -Deaf? No. -No, she hear OK. Mother is not to... that's not the Christmas cutlery! Very nice blouse you are wearing. Thanks. Where is your man? I think he's with that Arndis who lives in Smyrlahraun. She was out shooting caribou with him last summer, I saw it on Facebook. She calls him her "stallion." The toast! Shall I get it darling? You need to mash it for her. She can't really chew. There is one chair missing! If a hungry person comes. It is a beautiful tradition, like Joseph and Mary come to look for shelter. How lovely! -We don't have a spare chair. Let's find a baby Jesus, Indiana. How about Bibbi, he's so cute? Johanna! This is to hold the flower. Bibbi will be our baby Jesus tonight. All children are welcome here, Jesus Bibbi. What a lovely tradition. That was my chair, when I was little. This is so good. Good salmon, mom. A bit slimy... Strange. I talk far too much. Shh... We normally listen to this. ...she gave birth to her begotten son, wrapped him in cloth and placed him in the straw because there was no bed- -Johanna dear, the sermon's started. We never listened to this on the radio, my nan just read it in her own peculiar way. Let's just listen and enjoy the meal! Did you know Brynjar Örn Sveinsson, head of the post office in Eskifjördur? You don't have to talk so loud. Laufey Guðmundsdóttir was his wife, little older than you. He got dementia too, just babbled nonsensically. Johanna! We were all so relieved when he finally croaked. Was like being liberated from an elephant. But you're not difficult, are you? You don't say a word. Let's listen to the priest! What a dreary voice that man has. She can't stand you. Can't handle you being a foreigner. Drop of sherry? No thanks. Are you a teetotaller? From Poland? I'm just not drinking these days. Oh, fuck a dead dog arse... -Everything alright, mum? The oven... just switched itself off? -What? Must have blown a fuse. What can we do? -What an absolute disaster. It will be fine. The salmon was delicious. We can just eat the ham, it's boiled right? It isn't the way it should be... Everything has to be the way it should be! We... we'll make an exception this time and cut straight to the risalamande. Johanna dear, give me a hand. You two just relax. Nan, we're going to eat the risalamande now. Are her hands cold? No, she's warm. Right then. -It's the risalamande. Bon appétit. Now for the real excitement, who's got the almond? My uncle Ari always got it at nan's. I could have punched him in the face. He was nan's favourite. Always got the biggest presents. Was there no..? No, I’ve not got it hidden. Did you swallow it? No, I chewed very thoroughly. You get the almond, Johanna! Dear me, who knew... What's for a present? A jigsaw. How wonderful. Unnar and I do a jigsaw puzzle on Christmas day, when we wake up. I'm not spoiling anything, am I? I'm so sorry... -We do a jigsaw in our PJs and drink malt and orange soda. You should get it. -No. Yes, you are the youngest that's the way it ought to be. I'll just get my own when I go back upstairs. Wow... 2000 pieces! -Nice picture. She's kind of peculiar, your daughter. But nice. She's my best friend. I don't know what I'd do without her. Shall we go into living room, nan? Listen, I was thinking... I'd like to stay the night. Us, that is… Just in my room. It's always so much fun here the morning after. Christmas day should be spent in your own home Unnar. I know. I have a big present waiting for you in Engihjalla. Something I want to tell you. We don't have to decide now. We'll just see. Hey, shouldn't we play the record? We found this old record at nan's. It's so good for old people to listen to music from back in their day. It brings back memories. We're going to play your record, nan! Oh, really busy? Look! Mum, look, she can hear it! Are you having fun, nana? She's the very best girl I ever found... Just what the hell do you think you're doing? Stop that… Stop that! Did you come here to spoil our Christmas?! You're not in Meistaravellir in that bloody estate. This is my home! Having a party? You'd like to have a party? You fucking tart... -Stop it! Shall we invite the boys round, eh? Yes, let’s… The repulsive Gúndi! And black-haired Siggi... Let's sit him in my chair so he can urinate and the smell never goes away! And that feral shitstain Maggi! Let's have a great party, a real proper one. Here... have a drink, go on... Drink! You must not hurt her! Not enough? Nothing is enough for you! You bottomless pit... I'm better than you! You couldn't raise a thing, you bloody drunk. Everything you touched withered or was taken away from you. Unnar has never wanted for anything, never gone to bed hungry or afraid. He's lived in total safety without anything bad coming to him. But me... I had to clean the shit and piss off of you lying asleep in your own vomit when I couldn't wake you up. You never gave me Christmas, you fucking invalid! Never spent your benefits on me. Where were my Barbies... my almond gift... Where was the glazed ham? The red cabbage, the beans? You fucker, you owe me money! This is my life! "Kiss your mommy goodbye.” "Mum's just popping out for a bit to buy her little one a present." "Then I'll return and we'll make dinner and have a cozy night in..." But you never came... No one was allowed to know... Because then they'd come and take me, just like they took my brother Joe and my sister Dísa... But in here I'm in control. No one can invade my privacy! Ah, that felt good. Right then... Shall we open some presents now? That sounds just lovely. Some are no doubt salivating with anticipation. Unnar and I normally take turns reading the cards, but I'll do it this time. To... That's for nan, from me and Unnar. Here you go dear. I didn't realize… you'd bring me a gift? We're just not used to it, mum. If I'd known I would have... -You're always giving gifts, Indiana, giving something of yourself. Hello there, “Stallion!” Yes, I know it's Christmas, they're having it in every house in town. I’m not daft! I'm... I'm not feeling my best. Think I'll have a lie down until the ham's ready. We could not know. -You've ruined our Christmas. I already told you, it's always just the two of us! I just thought it would be good to have big family. It's true what mum said... no one can be trusted! I bring you here and you try to hurt her? I don't know if I believe everything we hear tonight. No more than you are handicapped. She's only trying to protect me. Don't you understand? You're not Icelandic, you can’t understand! I'm just trying to help you! -She was right about you all along! I'm leaving. I've got to stay here. You don't have to stay here, you want to stay. Thank you for this sleeping bag. Don't go... When you come home, I no longer be in Engihjalli. I'm sorry for shouting at you. Let's talk about this tomorrow, alright? I wish you all the best, Unnar. Don't go... Unnar? Have you phoned in sick yet? Yeah. You have to eat something. I want you to pop down to the chemist. I need Almogran, 12.5 milligrams. I'm down to the last lot. My head… is exploding! She's driving me nuts... I can't take it anymore! Unnar? Go up there and tell her to stop. Unnar! Stick in some earplugs! I can't... my ears are all swollen. Do something about it, boy… Do something useful for a change. Unnar! Thank god... Try to wash yourself when you get a nose bleed. I won't be around forever. Then come out and help me do the planting.
