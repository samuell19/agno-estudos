What kind of monster would do this? It's been a rough year. We're all just still trying to adjust. I'm sorry for your loss. Sue was a really nice lady. The mutants have us surrounded. I knew we should've built the walls higher. But then I remembered the rocket launcher, so, Jean blasts it through the windows and the suckers are all like. Didn't you vanquish the mutants the last time I was here? We need to talk after dinner. Yeah, but they come back from the dead. For you. Are you okay, Sammy? Hm. She hit a door, in the face. Getting in trouble at school. Hey, get back here! I used to do roller derby and the best way to get rid of a black eye is a hot compress. Found that stuff lying around, thought you might miss it and wanna take it back to your house. Thanks. How thoughtful. You can put it in one of my drawers. Why are we eating Lou's Express? I hate that place. "Mm, I'm Sammy. Everything sucks and I can't get over myself." Ow! It burns 'cause it's true! Shut up! Stop it, Sammy! You know, I've been too easy on you. My parents used to work me hard and punish me for much less. Dr. Klein would say that you're mostly damaged from Grandma. Oh, that idiot. What a waste of money. You know, when I feel "meh", I work harder. I don't have time to think or to get into trouble. He'd call that repression. I don't wanna have this talk right now, but you're forcing it. You're starting a class at the community college. Wait, what? It's either that or Camp Sparrow Cliff. Summer is not a time to just sit around. I want good grades and perfect attendance. You mess this up and it's straight to camp. Got it? Good. And so that you're extra busy, you can take over Patricia's chores. - Yes! - Patricia? Keep a close eye on your sister. No more games if she gets into trouble. Let go of me! I can't waste time policing your plebeian butt! I have a kingdom to protect! Whatever! I know what you really do with your nasty friends. "Oh, Jean, I need it bigger and sharper!" I'm telling him how to forge a crossbow! Kingdom Cog sucks! Don't do anything stupid. I chose a spa 'cause I love the spa. And I like helping people relax. Smoothie drink. It's the best one on the list. And I want the doggy daycare, because dogs are my life. My best friend is my puppers, Mr. Max. Dave's got passion, and a personal connection to the business. Good job, Dave. Great. All right! So, now! Who's next? How about our youngest entrepreneur? Come on up here. Good business people always have smiles. Okay, great. I can't decide. I mean, I'm not really into any of these. Oh, um... Okay. All right, well, let's get you into it, all right? Just throw away the paper. Throw away the list. Throw it away, great. Now... Dig deep. What is your passion and how do we turn that passion into money? Go big. I guess maybe a store that sells dishes and stuff? Okay. It'd look like a regular shop, except you can take a bat and break everything. Oh, and then you could like charge customers extra if they wanted to upgrade to an ax or something- Yeah, um, I think the overhead would be really enormous. Okay, do you have any other ideas? A euthanasia service that comes to your door. Okay, Sammy, I get the feeling that you're afraid. Afraid to go for - that dream. - What dream? It's okay to be scared. You can only grow by pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Thrive! In the uncomfort zone, okay? You have until the end of the class to figure it out. Okay! So! All of your assignments will be based upon the business that you choose. And at the end of the semester, you will give a presentation of your prospectus in front of a panel of judges. Your next assignment is to find someone in your business and interview them, all right? Really get to know them. Where are you going? Taking a shit. Try fiber. You were grunting in there for a while. What happened there? Fist fight. Three against one. Totally beat their ass. Looks like it. You're bleeding. Oh, crap! You remind me of me when I was your age. You wish, lady. I wasted a lot of time being angry. Are you a teacher or something? - No. - Then get lost. You can't smoke in here. Come on! Just let me go back to class! Quit whinin', we're almost there. My life is over if I get in trouble again! Hello? - Sorry we're late. - Oh, thank god you're here! She's gonna be my assistant today. I'm what? Great, you can start right now! Okay, stand over there and pay attention to my cues. No. Or would you rather go to the admissions office? I'm sure your parents would love to get a call from them. Get over there. - What's your name? - Sammy. What? Ah, it'll do. Where's that pesky ball? It's in your hair! It's in my hair? Now I gotcha. This ball has been trying to get away from me, but now I've got it and it's not going anywhere. Wait a minute. Where'd it go? Oh, I see it. I see it, I see it! You forget that ball. It is an annoying ball. I have a story to tell you guys. Everybody huddle in close. Long ago and far away, the sun shined big and bright over a beautiful village. Everyone was happy there. But one day, an ancient evil descended upon the land. It swallowed the sun. It became so dark that all the flowers and trees died, and the animals left. I can't handle this! It's all right, Levi. Hang in there, because some very brave villagers decided to band together to fight the darkness. They gathered all the candles and lamps in the village, to make light. Here's a candle. Here's a candle and lamp. Candles and lamps for everyone. Here we go, but aside from light, what else do flowers and trees need to grow? Water! Bingo! Using this new light, the villagers gathered all the water they could find. They looked for water leftover from faucet drips and at the bottoms of buckets and even in unexpected places like under chairs. You see anything? Yes! Good! And now, welcome Sammy, our water collector. Sammy's a little shy so let's give her some encouragement! All right, and hand her your water drips as she goes by. They won't bite. Here you go. Oh, she's doing a good job. Now. The villagers sprinkled the water over the barren land. Aim it at me and spray. The trigger. And all the plants returned. And the creatures returned, too. Sensing how fearless the villagers were, the ancient evil grew weak, and left to recover in the shadows. The villagers knew that the evil would one day return, but until then, we celebrate! Don't eat it! Sammy! What did you think of the show? Oh, you mean my kidnapping? I was held hostage and forced to watch some corny bullshit. I thought you were enjoying the magic. It's not real. Oh, yeah? Then how did I do it? You stuff a bunch of crap up your sleeve and then pull it out your ass. Sammy! Sammy! Where have you been? It's already the first day of class and you're skipping it? This is unacceptable. I was talking to this businesswoman, getting a headstart on the assignment. Oh, yes. Margot Sala. Conjurer. Well, magic is not on the approved list, but if that is your passion, go for that dream, but come to class. - It's nice meeting you, Margot. - You too. Keep it! It's yours. Okay. I am not doing magic for this stupid class! Your loss. Loans. Adverti... Accounting, wow. Maybe you can do my taxes next year. Don't you feel better now that you're applying yourself? Mm-hm. Good. I thought we weren't allowed to have this in the house? Well, that wasn't really my rule. I actually used to really like it as a kid. Hey. Hey, we're just finishing dinner. Sorry, the line at the store was so long. Oh. We, uh, saved you some drumsticks. - Oh. - Yeah. And we can crack open that durian after dinner. You got it? I'm a little scared, but bring it on. Oh. Hey. Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to them. Hey, uh, this is Quong Jo. It's gonna take a while. Uh... You don't have to stay. It's no problem. Okay. Hey. Yeah, I'll be on my computer in just a minute. I gotta tell you, this whole... Hey. Hang out a little. I have homework. Sammy, my sweet girl, are you tucked in tight? This one is called the Empress and the Moon. There once was an empress who was loved by all in her kingdom. She was so beloved, even the gods were jealous. So they spiked her tea with a cursed potion that made her weightless and immortal. The poor empress floated higher and higher until she reached the Moon where she was doomed to be alone forever. The empress watched helpless as her kingdom cried out for her every night. But one day, she heard a loud crash on the other side of the Moon. A visitor had landed. It was a space rabbit. The empress was terrified and hightailed it back to her side. And for a while, they were both lonely on opposite sides of the Moon. Finally, the empress decided to give the strange creature a chance and bravely invited it to sit with her. They begin talking then sharing stories. Turns out they had a lot in common. They still sit together every night to watch over her kingdom and if you look up, you can see the rabbit and the empress looking back. Goodnight, my sweet, amazing girl. Can't see shit. Okay, that'll do it for today. Thanks, guys. Hey, Sammy, can I talk to you for a second? Some of these answers sound a bit odd. That's just how she talks. "How she talks." "Stage musicians started in the 1800s. Sometimes they use mirrors, tigers and short assistants." And then it's just a word-for-word copy of the Wikipedia entry for magicians. Can I just do a different business? Sure! If you had come to me earlier. But you tried to pull this on me instead! - But I- - No excuses. Nothing great ever comes easy. What if Jobs and the Woz had given up when their first computer failed? The who? Do it again. And this time, talk to Margot. Or I'm gonna have to fail you. Oh! I thought you weren't interested in my what did you call it, um, "corny bullshit." I need you to fill this out. You want me to do your homework? Please. Look, I can't just give you this info. I am sworn to secrecy by the rules of my society! Who's in this society? Clowns? Jugglers? Assholes? Why would I waste time on someone who isn't serious - about what I do? - Wait! Fine. I'm sorry. I've got five dollars and... Let's see. A Boba card. Prove to me you're worthy of my answers. Come back tomorrow at four. If you can figure out how I did any of my tricks, I'll fill this out. "String magic. Paper magic. Oriental magic? Add some mystique to your act by performing as a silent conjurer from the Far East. Complete the look with a black wig and orange makeup." Gotcha. "Tenkai palm. Conceal the card in between the thumb and palm center. Maneuver the first and second fingers to grip the top of the card. Pull forward to reveal." Hey! Get up. Dad's on my butt about the chores. I'll get to it. Whoa, are you doing magic? Show me a trick. Get out! Dad! Shut up! Okay, fine. Close your eyes. Cover them, too. You can look now. You may think pulling a card out of thin air is impossible, but you're wrong, bitch. I saw the card in your hand. You should work on that. You know, I control a whole army of wizards. Maybe you can work for me someday. If you ever stop sucking. I can come in today, whatever the time is. Uh, I'll grab the drives and I'll be right there. I'll see you at the office in 20. I figured out your tricks. Shoot. You turn off the lights to create a distraction. Then you use palming to make the balls appear. The flowers are retractable, like a feather duster. And I'm guessing you use some sort of rigged pocket for the rabbit and- - Sebastian. - Huh? The rabbit's name is Sebastian. And your front palm would be more impressive, if you switched hands halfway through, like this. So I'm right? Are you gonna help me with this assignment or not? You're close, but you're missing the point. - Hand me your smokes. - No. I'll give 'em back! Be careful. Hold out your hands. This stuff will kill ya. But who am I to take away from your agonizing self-destruction? Oh and where did I put that? Ah, yeah. You see, magic is about making an audience feel something. Ideally, it would be a sense of wonder, but I'd settle for mild rage in your case. You have some raw talent, but smoking will ruin your hands, if it doesn't kill you first. So? I don't care about this stuff. Mm-hm. Hi! Hey. How are ya? I love this. Looks so good. New bag of tricks, see. My new gravity coin finally in. It is the real deal. Oh. Didn't know we had company. We don't, but I'll be right in. Go on. Are you having a party? My weekly salon. I'd invite you in, but secret society and all that. I don't wanna meet your loser friends anyway. Peace. Oh, Sammy. These will work better than that punch card. Peace. What are we doing here? Have a good time. I'm gonna need more than that. Ready for fun? Watch. You got one. That's a start. Come on, come on! Come on. - Last one. - Yeah, neat. Oh! I love it. I'm 64 short. This sucks. Language. What're you trying to get? How much to buy it? It's fine. I'll just pick something else. Hang on a minute. Where did you get... Cream soda and a lemon-lime. - Thanks, Dad. - Thanks. You guys having a good time? Good. Uh, well, I uh... I wanted to talk to you both about something. Well, uh... I care a lot about Marianne, and she cares a lot about me, and she really cares a lot about you both. And, well, uh... We wanted to take the next step and get married. What! You're such an asshole! I mean, I can't believe you're doing this to us! You've only been dating her for six months! I know you're upset, but you can't talk to me like that! I'm never coming out! Fine. Stay in there! Hey! Sammy? All right, you okay? Looks worse than it is. So? What? Nothing. I don't wanna talk about it. Okay. Feels good. No way. Just try it! Go on! It's not gonna hurt ya. Feel better? So, should I be expecting any more of these late-night visits? I'm gonna have to start charging for first aid supplies. You know, did you ever think of channeling that rage into something, um, less smashy? Like... Boom. Oh, god. And I suppose you want me to start calling myself "The Spectacular Sammy". Hey, that has a ring to it. Kidding. Right here is good. But seriously, I could teach you. I wasn't lying when I said you had talent. Maybe I'll stop by sometime. We start tomorrow! There once was an empress who was loved by all in her kingdom. For example, a worker who has to manage only one action, like slicing bread or layering meats, are far more efficient than their counterparts who have to assemble the entire sandwich. That only makes sense. Everybody understands that logic. Right? It's just, it's the McDonald's theory. You know, when you put something together, you want each individual person to put one thing to contribute to the whole. Hello? Hi, Sammy. Um... Well, just give me a second, okay? Hello! Were you stealing toilet paper from the school? Where I get my stash is none of your concern. Take a seat. - Did you bring your cards? - Yeah. Excellent. Take 'em out. Nice case. Now show me your shuffle. This is stupid! Because you're holding it stupid. Okay, look. This is called a Biddle grip. Your first finger goes here, followed by the rest over here. Okay, yep. Now you do the same with both hands. Try again, but use only the smallest amount of force. Almost! Can I? Yeah. He really hates me. Well, you have to earn his trust. Every magician needs a great assistant, and Sebastian's the best. He can squeeze into tight spaces and he always knows exactly where he needs to be. Sometimes he surprises me. But he's always in the right place. Aren't ya? Here ya go. How do I earn his trust? Hey. Bunny. You kinda look like this lady. What? In the picture. Oh! Yeah, that's my mom. - She seems cool. - Oh, she absolutely fearless. Is that your house? It was my Noggy Momma's. People would address letters to the pink house on the hill, and the postman would know exactly where to bring them. I used to love spending summers there. That was a long time ago. Can I join your next party? Salon. You're not quite there yet, but keep at it, though. What's that for? It's how you earn his trust. Okay. This game is broken. Oh, Dad, you're crushing it. Where's Sammy? Working on her assignment. She seems better. I guess the classes are paying off, oh! Dad! Hey. Wait, you're gonna run into that wall. We're playing a game I'm working on. You wanna try it? I'm kinda busy. Jump, jump. Well, look, I know this is a lot to take in. Sue will always be your mom. I hope that you can think of me as a new member of the family. And if you ever wanna talk or anything- I'm fine. Okay. Great. What's up? It's our fee. We just got stiffed. Well, that's messed up. Yeah, it happens. We gotta do something. You ready? Yep. Go! Yeah! What is all this? Yeah, check it out. Why do you perform mainly for kids? I mean, you're probably good enough for adults. I just like seeing them laugh. Vega. There you are, Vega. Dave. There you are, Dave. Sammy. You should start putting together an act. - I should? - Yeah! Well, I mean, you still have a lot of work to do, but people should see it. I guess? Okay. First thing we gotta do is figure out what does Sammy the magician do and why? Can't I just do a couple of tricks and call it a day? You should tell a story. Think of a feeling or a problem, and give it a shape with a magic prop. Dr. Klein tried to make me do the exact same thing. "Imagine your anger as a person. What would they say?" I couldn't take him seriously. So my anger people wouldn't have mouths. Just big assholes for faces. I don't know what to say about anything. Well, if you think about your dad and Marianne, how would you make a trick about that? And then I'd just walk away! That's not magic. That's murder. Whatever. You said it could be anything! Well, it has the emotion, but where's the transformation? The awe! Do you seriously do all this stuff? All the greats do. Oh. Oh, Sammy, wait a minute. I almost forgot to give you this. Don't open it until you get home. Hey. Can I stay out a little on Friday? You know the rules. Get your butt straight home after class. It's for extra credit. We're gonna watch a documentary about banks. I'm not stupid, Sammy. What nefariousness are you up to? I just really need to boost my grade. I swear. Dad's gonna be working late anyway, so you don't even have to do anything. Just don't rat on me. You're gonna get me in trouble. Get extra credit some other way. No, a dragon attack! Ah, ah, ah. You can play after you finish yours. But it'll take forever! Well, better get started then, hm? Are these gonna be enough? Don't worry. It's just a party for everyone to get to know each other. They're gonna love you. I know how we can finish hella fast. But, I get to stay out a little on Friday. Whoa. It's way faster if I do all the toothpicks and you do all the ribbons 'cause specialist workers are much more efficient than multitasking ones. Did you learn that in class? Hey! Silence! Whoa. Do you, Sammy Ko, promise to never reveal our magical secrets to a layman? Yeah. Do you promise never to embarrass your fellow conjurers by performing bad magic? Will do my best? And lastly, did you bring a worthy snack? Welcome to the Gathering of Scoundrels. Now let's jam! Oh, dear. Really. - Come on. - Okay, so... Yeah, she's heard this story, maybe. So I go to this casino, right? Like a small casino. I'm not gonna go to a big casino, 'cause you don't wanna... Not you, she shouldn't do this. Don't do this. This is not good. And so I go to this casino and I make friends with the dealer, I sit at the table, we're talking. "Oh, I've never played cards before." So, I mean, like, who suspects this guy, right? Look at this honest face, right? So I just do a little, mm-mm-mm, and... I clean him out. You must be loaded. Oh, I did all right, until some pit boss from some backwards casino recognized me. Did a couple of months for that one. - He did. He did. - I did. So, I gave it up, I went honest, and now I get by gigging with, uh, Miss Mm-Hm, and uh, I work part-time at the Jumbo Stop. But it still sneaks out every once in a while. Teach me. Absolutely not. Oh. Oh, Puck! Oh, Puck! Sammy! - Oh, oh, oh! - Oh, oh, oh! Bye. Got your bird? Good, good. - Mm, goodnight. - Night. Can't wait for next Saturday. What's Saturday? Oh, uh, the Marvelous Gang are going on tour. Yeah, we got a last-minute booking - doing the state fair circus. - That sounds cool! How long are you guys gone for? Three weeks. Um, it was really nice meeting you, Sammy. You too, Puck. Bye! I guess I'll help you clean up. Thanks! That'd be great. Is your family still there in Tallya? Tallya. My family and I got separated when I was little. I don't really know where anyone is now. Not even your parents? My parents died a while ago. That sucks. Have you tried looking for other people in your family? Yeah, once. I even hired an investigator. That was a waste. But I don't really think about it anymore. But what about online? Social media and DNA tests are connecting people like all the time. That is just a thinly-veiled way for the state to get your info. But they could still be out there. I think it's gettin' late. How about I finish up and you go home? I'll walk you to the door. Come on. - It was such a good night. - Uh-huh. Where were you tonight? I told you. Watching a movie for class. Shut your dumb face. Your teacher called. He said you haven't been going to class. He didn't know anything about the movie tonight. Where were you? I'm telling Dad. Don't! He'll send me to that awful jail camp! Then you better have a fatty stack of Kingdom Coin. You are such a narc! I'm just doing what I was told. Why are you so cool with everything that's happening? It's like... Like you don't even miss Mom at all. Why are you showing me this? Jean doesn't know about this section. Remember when Mom said flamingos had taken over the yard? Yeah and Dad said they only live near big lakes. So Mom said, "they took a plane!" This Margot. Is she a Voldemort? No. She's like a kid's party wizard. She's kinda helping me with some stuff. Dad would freak if he knew you were skipping class to do magic with a stranger. Please don't tell him. You have to go back to school. And stop being so, you know, "I'm Sammy and everything is pain." Ow! I'm trying. Three weeks is a long time. I'll be back before you know it. I wish you could be there tomorrow to see us off. Me too! But my dad is throwing that stupid party. I just, I don't know how I'm gonna handle it. Focus on your act. Have you thought of a story yet? My mom was good at telling stories. Yeah? I used to have these crazy nightmares where I'd wake up in the middle of the night screaming. The only thing that could calm me down was my mom's stories. She's gone. Now. But I still listen to a tape she made. Even though it hurts to. It's hella dumb. You never get over losing loved ones. I mean, you'll heal, but, you won't be the same. I'm glad we met. I feel like we should celebrate. Do something big. I can't. I have school. Oh. Right. Well, I guess this is it, then. You know, it's just one class. Are you sure this is safe? Don't chicken out on me. I'm not. What's your design? It's gotta be grand. Something worthy of permanence. You're overthinking it. Hey! Gross. Oh! I got it, I got it. How about something that says a bond that can't be broken? Not by time, or space. Sammy and Margot forever. I've got it! Stay still, and uh, bite on this. - Ready? - Yeah. Are you serious? Bye. Hey, Sammy! You're gonna be okay. Just work on your act! Marianna and I met at a very difficult time, and she's embraced me, Sammy and Patricia, and brought happiness back into our lives. It's been very nice meeting the Ravels. And thank you to my family for coming. As many of you know, I'd lost hope of ever feeling like I'd find this kind of connection again, but then I met Angus. And the biggest gift is that I get to be a member of the Ko family. Sammy and Patricia are incredible girls, and I can't wait to see what wonderful women they become. Ow. Sammy! Try again. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'll see you out there, Dad. Well, I'm gonna take them home. Okay. Good party. Mm, you got a little lips there. Bye, Sammy. Bye, Pat. Hi, this is Leo Zigora from Tri City Community College. I'm calling to let you know that I have to fail Sammy for lack of attendance. She hasn't been to school in several weeks. Sammy's been skipping school to hang out with a wizard lady. - What? What lady? - I don't know! Her name's Margot. She's teaching Sammy magic. Let's go. How could you let this happen? She lied to me, too! When I found out, I said she had to go back to school. Narc. Can I still play Kingdom Cog? No. - But you said if I- - Bring in your computer. Sammy, I've tried. I've paid for your therapy. Bailed you out at school. Paid for classes to keep you busy. - I am busy now. - With magic. Why didn't you ask me about it? Instead, you chose to lie to me. You even infected Patricia with your bad behavior. You're always working! You don't care about how I feel at all! Your mom's death has been hard on all of us. For me, your sister. But the difference is, we go about our day trying to keep it together. For some reason, you think a different set of rules apply. You hurt people. I've thought a lot about this and there's a spot open at Sparrow Cliff and you start tomorrow. I'll run away! You wouldn't last a day out there. Start packing. Pat! I want that computer now! Sammy! - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Two more and Sebastian - Oh, yeah, Sebastian. Margot! Hey, what're you doing here? I wanna come on tour with you. Is something wrong? Everything's good. Let's go! Mm. - Sammy! - No. What's goin' on? So you're the ones that've been messing with my kid. Okay, just take it easy. Do you have any idea how hard it is? How much I worry about her? You don't have to worry about me anymore! I'm leaving with Margot. What? No, wait, hang on a second. Can we all just stop and talk this out? It might sound a little crazy, but you like kids and I'm one! We could work out an emancipated minor thing. Oh, that's not gonna happen! Please, Margot. Sammy... You have a family. So it's a no? Please, can we just talk? You know, I should call the police on you. - She didn't do anything- - You stay out of this! Don't you have a family? Or friends your own age? Why are you hanging around with my daughter? Look, I was just trying to help her! Fuck all of you! Sammy! What're you doing? Am I still going to Sparrow Cliff? Sleep. It's not the right time. I knew it was too soon. I... I'm so sorry, Marianne. Hey, I just... Chris is gonna take over the client. I just, need to be with my family. Thanks. Now it's a party. I'm gonna get some fresh air. Hey, Sammy. Margot left town right after we got back. You inspired her to start looking for her family again. I mean, she tried to get a hold of you, but... Anyway, she left all of her props to you. Get rid of it. I don't do that anymore. Even Sebastian? Do whatever you want. I think I will hang onto him, if you don't mind. Hey, did Margot ever tell you why she got into magic? Seeing kids smile or some shit. What a creep. You know, Margot was just a girl when she lost her family. Come here. Sit down. You should know. So, Margot grew up in Budapest, and one day, she was at a march with her parents and soldiers started shooting into the crowd. Her parents were hit. Margot tried to save them but she couldn't. Blood was everywhere. She said it was like roses blooming all over their bodies. Her grandmother sent her here. They thought she'd be safer with friends, but being away from home and not knowing what happened to the rest of her family was... It was really hard. Someone found her, unconscious in the bathtub. She spent the next few weeks at a hospital, recovering. Still wishing she hadn't survived and then one day, a magician showed up on the kids ward. And he made her laugh. Something she didn't think was possible again. I miss you. Hey, Puck! I brought some ideas! Let's get to work, then. Sammy, stop! - Just keep your eyes closed. - What are you doing? Turn, turn, turn. Okay. Open your eyes. Everything okay? Something's happened with Sammy. We're at 224 Oakwood, come now! Dad, hurry up! - Is Sammy okay? - Hurry, this way. Huh? Just follow me! You know, we want to pamper those little helpers because your depression might be bringing them down and they might need a break. They might need a day out, from you. - I wanna present. - Oh, goodness. You haven't been to class. You failed out. Yeah, well I'm here now. I'm going on. Do you even have a report? It's all in here. Worked really hard on this. Please. I want to reach for that dream. Okay! Okay, yes. You can go on, but just make it quick, okay? All right, go ahead. Come on. - Yeah. - Oh, my god. - Hey, how's it goin'? - Hi. Great. We know that your best friend means the world to you. We plan to have very rigorous staff- What the hell is happening? Just watch the show. What show? Just look. Angus! Hey. Is Sammy all right? She texted it was an emergency. Just watch the show. So always remember, at Dave's Doggy Daycare, we'll bring your puppers up from a canine to a K-10. So remember, when you're thinking about the presentations at the end of the day... Remember. Oh, hold on! Hi! Uh, we actually have one more presentation. Just one more, I promise. Okay, great. Hey. I'm Sammy. And I'm gonna tell you a story. It's kinda weird, but... Here it is, anyway. This is just angry teenage rambling. There once was an empress who everyone really liked. But the gods were jealous of her. So they banished her to the Moon forever. She was really sad because she was all alone, and she missed people. But one day, the Cosmic Rabbit was running through the skies. The rabbit saw the lonely empress and set off for the Moon, 'cause it was lonely, too. Together, they turned that barren space rock into a home. They're still there now. And if you look closely... You can see them looking back. That's it. Hey. What'd you think about the show? Your mom would've loved that. Hi. I'm glad you're all right. That was pretty incredible. Maybe I'll let you be my assistant sometime. Oh. Hey. Hey.
