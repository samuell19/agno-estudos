(WOMAN GROANS) I can't... Nanine! Nanine! Nanine, get the doctor quickly! (WEAKLY) Doctor? If you can't make me live, how can he? No, no, don't say such things, Marguerite. You'll live. You must live. MARGUERITE: Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart... (WOMAN SNIFFLING) ...where the world can't see me. (SOBS SOFTLY) If I'm dead, there'll be no stain on our love. Shh. Don't think such things, Marguerite. Even if we've can't to go to the country today, think of how happy we were once, how happy we shall be again. Think of the day you found the four-leaf clover, of all the good luck it's going to bring us. Think of the vows we heard Nisha and Gustav make, and that we're going to make to each other. This is for life, Marguerite. Marguerite? (WHIMPERING) (SOBBING) Marguerite. Ah, don't leave me! (CRYING) Marguerite, come back! Come back! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (WOMAN SNIFFLING) Jean? JEAN: Wow! SUSAN: It's just a movie. JEAN: Don't say that! When that last scene was over, Garbo got up, marched off and went out to eat. JEAN: She died! She died a few years ago. She died in Robert Taylor's arms. -Oh, dear! -Oh! If I'd known it was going to affect you this way, I would've signed up for the series with Fred. Of course, he always falls asleep before the end. He's seen Breakfast at Tiffany's a dozen times, he hasn't made it to Moon River yet. How are things between you and Fred? Wanna go for coffee? If we make it fast. I'm supposed to be home by 11:00, or Fred'll just have... We'll make it fast. -So tell me... -Don't worry. Fred has you on a curfew? He calls me at work all hours of the day, he checks on everything I do. (SOFTLY) The affair was short, the repercussions seem to be lasting forever. MAN: Can I get a latte? Are you going to a therapist? SUSAN: When I tell Fred where I've been or what I've been doing, he thinks I'm lying. Now he's got this new thing, when he gets home from work, listen to this, he hits the redial button on the phone to see who's the last person I talked to. -No. -The affair was pure sex. We didn't feel anything for each other. We were polite to each other. Well, I guess sleeping with each other is the highest form of politeness. (LAUGHS) It's not as if Fred and I are doing anything. What are you staring at? Uh, no... Do you? Do I what? Do you and Roger sleep together? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I know you share the same bed, Fred and I share the same bed. I mean, do you and Roger do anything in bed? Mmm-hmm. -After how many years? -Fourteen. Guinness Book of Records know about this? Not often, right? Fairly often. SUSAN: Well, often means different things to different people. -You know that man? -JEAN: No. SUSAN: Youch! Wasn't he at the movies? -(CUP CLATTERS) -Uh-huh. Did you see how he looked at you? Oh, stop it! -We got to get you home. -(GASPS) Fred. (GIGGLING) It'd be so much more fun if we drove home together. I wish, but you know my hours, the only way I can get anywhere near on time is if I leave right from work. Oh, well, whoever said that office management was easy or highly paid... Well, I'll talk to you tomorrow and I'll see you next Monday. Oh, that's just what I need. Vivien Leigh in Anna Karenina, something to remind me what happens to married women who have affairs. Oh, no! Thank God there are no trains out where I live. (SUSAN LAUGHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) JEAN: (SINGSONG) Morning! ROGER: Hey! -I cooked. -Thank you. Can I get you to do it for me every day? Yeah, if you play your cards right. Bess, could you please turn off the sprinklers? Why don't you put them on a timer? Well, I like to do it myself. I feel like I'm part of the earth. Well, I don't care to be part of the earth. Just finish your breakfast, please. I'm finished. Bess? I'll untie it when I get to school. I think you should untie it now. Mom! (MIMIC BESS) Mom! Hey, who wants more, huh? -No, thanks. -What... No compliments for the chef? (CAR ENGINE STARTING) (SHOUTS) Hey! I've got two stops to make so I'll see you in a half hour. I turn away for one minute. BOTH: Mom! JEAN: Bye! (SIGHS CONTENTLY) Ooh! Hips. Hips. Hips. (SOFTLY) Yeah. Hips, hips, hips. Excuse me? Could you have a look at this, please? Ah, you need to see my wife for this. -Jean? -JEAN: Yeah? Have a problem. Well, let's take a look at it. My roses, they get all set to open up, then they collapse and go brown. Hmm. Thrips. You need to use a systemic. White lightning. I never understood why it didn't get the rating it deserved. Well, I'll just buy a new one. Oh, no, it's really easy to get rid of this. If you can save a child, you should. It's a rose. To me, they're like children. In some ways they are. (PHONE RINGING) ROGER: Hello? Well, yeah. Just a second. Jean, it's for you. Susan! Got it! Hello. (JEAN HUMMING SOFTLY) You want to go to the movies? Oh, I got to do this. Fred and Susan have another emergency session with their shrink. They're still going to that shrink? Yeah, what does that mean? What does it mean? Well, neither Susan or Fred ever saw a shrink before they got married, so what I think it means is maybe Susan and Fred don't bring out the best in each other. Hmm. Ah, it happens. -What's the movie? -Anna Karenina. Who? Not for you. Ask me again when they're showing, uh... BOTH: Clint Eastwood! Okay. Bye-bye. (BOTH LAUGH) WOMAN: (ON SCREEN) I was wondering what he was doing... This way. -(WHISPERING) Right here. -Thank you. Mmm-hmm. Excuse me. (SOFTLY) Ah, sorry. I'm so sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. WOMAN 2: Now, I never know what my son may be doing. (CHUCKLES) Perhaps it's just as well. WOMAN 1: Oh, why? WOMAN 2: Have a look at those eyes, my dear, perhaps you'll understand what I mean. He's very handsome. (CHUCKLES) (TRAIN BELL TOLLS) (TRAIN CHUGGING) (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (STEAM HISSING) (TRAIN CHUGGING) (AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING) (JEAN SNIFFLING) It's wrinkled, but it's clean. Thank you. Did you like Vivien Leigh more than the Garbo version? Oh, Garbo, she had those eyes. Yeah. I liked this one better. But you don't have to ask me why. ATTENDANT: Thank you, ma'am. Good night. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Excuse me. Uh, would you like to have a cup of coffee? I mean, it's early. We can talk about the movie. Thank you, I don't think so. Ah, look, um, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to pick you up. My name is Tom Doster, I'm a 40-something, I'm married, happily, I might add and... Well, I'm the father of a terrific son. I know all fathers say that their sons are terrific, but mine really is. Well, I'm a structural engineer. I could go into great detail about what that involves, but to keep it simple, I just tell people I build things. My wife was going to come with me to this film series, but Mondays aren't a good night for her because she volunteers for project Helping Hand, and they cook things for people who can't cook for themselves. You sold me. Good. I'm sorry, I didn't even tell you my name. My name is Jean, Jean Townsend. -Jean. -Hi. Um, you were born here? -Colorado. -Ah, Colorado. And you've lived here, say, ten years. See, I have these incredible psychic powers. Seven. -Seven. -Hmm. Now, you're married and no children? Married and one daughter. See, I used to be a lot better at this. (JEAN LAUGHS) So, uh, you're a nurse? Close. I own a nursery. Ah, lots of little children running around? No, it's not that kind of a nursery. Well, Climbing Rose nursery in Topanga. We got a lot of little bushes running around. -So, you own a nursery. -Mmm-hmm. My parents lent Roger and I the money and we wanted to pay them back in five years, we paid them back in three. I'm very proud of that. That's great! So, um, why do you think people go to see these old movies? Well, there's not much romance and passion today. I think people need it. The old movies are a way to get it. Really? Even the man of the '90s needs romance? Especially a man of the '90s. Hmm. Here I thought women had the market cornered on romance. No way. JEAN: Thank you. I'm over there. You don't have to walk with me. -See you next week. -Yes. My friend Susan will be back by then. Ah, what is the film next week? Betty Davis, Now Voyager. Oh, my, double hanky. Cloth hanky. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) -How was the movie? -I cried my eyes out. Hmm, must've been good. Funniest thing happened to me tonight. Hmm. Roger, are you awake? The funniest thing happened to you tonight. Mmm-hmm. This really nice man that I was sitting next to asked me out for coffee. Roger? Ah, this really nice man asked you out for coffee. I don't think that's unusual, if I saw you alone, I'd ask you for coffee, too. Oh, I forgot to put the coffee on for tomorrow. I knew you'd be late. I did it. Ah, I'm so domestic in my old age. You're still looking pretty good, for an old man. Hey, Dad! (BARKS) Hey! How was the water? -It was great. -Good! And, I was damn good today, too. When did you start using words like that? Want to hear the words I don't use around you? No. Ask me again in ten years. KEVIN: How come you're turning here? This isn't the right way home. TOM: Well, I thought you might enjoy the scenic route. KEVIN: Come on, Dad, I've got things to do. TOM: This will be pretty, trust me. KEVIN: I'm twelve, what choice do I have? (INAUDIBLE) (HONKS) Dad? Excuse me? The Anniversary section. -Oh, just around the corner. -Thank you. ATTENDANT: You want a basket for all of that? TOM: Well, I think I've got everything I need. Oh, I forgot candles, that's the most important thing, right? ATTENDANT: Two aisles over. TOM: Thank you. Well, small world! -What are you doing here? -(CHUCKLES) It's my parents' 50th wedding anniversary this coming week, and they're coming in from Denver. I thought I'd throw them a little party at home. I saw you the other day, when you drove by? Why didn't you come in? Well, I didn't really think about it. I would have given you the grand tour. Oh, my son was with me. Well! You could've brought him in. It's just a nursery. Yeah. My secretary's birthday, surprising her. Having lunch brought in, you know. Boss and his secretary. Have you really thought about that? The boss and his secretary, or you know, boss and her secretary? It's like they almost have a marriage, they spend the same amount of time together as a husband and wife. Hmm, what color? I don't know. Margaret's a pink person. How many of these in a box? ATTENDANT: Uh, fifty. Need another one, Margaret's 63, you know. ATTENDANT: So, is that everything? Good. GIRL: Jennifer... So? Would you like to get some lunch? -Oh, well, I... -I mean, what the hell! Come on, we both got to eat, right? Yeah. Okay, all right. And I wanted to give my parents a big, fancy party cause 50 years is 50 years. My mother wouldn't have it. Now, she said that a golden wedding anniversary only celebrates good luck, luck that you didn't die before you got there. (LAUGHING) My mom is very, very practical. Yeah. How about a big, gooey piece of cake? -Oh, no way! -Oh, come on, two forks? No, no. What are you working on? What's the engineer engineering? Well, it's a new bank building, going to have it framed soon. You are accusing it of something it didn't do? Ah, no. That's when you get the last piece of steel set in place. I know. I know, it was a terrible joke, but I couldn't resist. Still, it must be wonderful when you look at a building years from now and you know you put it there. Well, every engineer would like to believe that. -Yeah, I'll get this. -Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, come on, it's only 12 bucks. No, please. All right, you can get it. I think we should split it. I'm sorry, it's the only way I'll do it. It's very nice to see you again. Same here. Will you be at the movies tonight? Sure as shootin'. Haven't said that since I was a little boy in Texas. Maybe you're still a little boy. I meant that in the very nicest way. That's all right. Well, uh, I guess I'll go, I'm going to be late. -See ya! -Bye. (PHONE RINGING) I think maybe the mashed potatoes will be better. Yeah. -Oh, really? -Think so. -Depends on how they taste. -Excuse me. (BESS CHUCKLES) (RINGING CONTINUES) Yeah, just a second. Hello? SUSAN: Hello, honey. Hi, what's up? My fever, that's what. I didn't even go in today. I kept thinking this cold would go away, but it hasn't. I'm not going out. Sure, sure, don't worry. Worry? I've just got a cold. Okay, all right, then. Buh-bye. (ROGER CHATTING WITH BESS) ROGER: Who was that? -Susan. -Hmm. Telling me not to be late. (BESS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) BESS: You can shop. ROGER: Hmm, well, seems like you've been doing a lot of shopping lately. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Let me see. Well, don't you look like a million bucks! Oh, stop. (LAUGHS) Jerry, please help me. Shall we just have a cigarette on it? Yes. (LIGHTER CLICKS) (WHISPERING) When I was young, I didn't care to look like Elizabeth Taylor, or have Rita Hayworth's body, or Marlene Dietrich's legs, I wanted to smoke like Betty Davis. Yeah, but you don't. No, it's bad for you. We could talk about your child. Our child. Thank you. JERRY: And will you be happy, Charlotte? Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moment. We have the stars. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (CAR HONKING) You know, it's still early, you sure you don't want to change your mind about having that cup of coffee? No, I have a busy day tomorrow. I really should go. -All right. -Okay. So? Anything I can do? Yeah, you can take out the potatoes and drain 'em and mash 'em. Oh, this looks heavy. I'll do it. Oh. Uh, why don't I set the table? It's buffet. I offered to split half the cost, I said, "Let's get a caterer," but you wouldn't. I'm not good at this sort of thing and I don't pretend to be. Why don't you check on Dad's drink? My rich sister, my rich widowed sister. It's hard to believe you two are even related. I do like the jewelry, though. Mmm. It's all real, too, of course. Ugh, she must have more money than God. Some people have all the luck. Ah, I don't know. Maybe Phillip had all the luck, he died. -(CHUCKLES) -I heard that. Daddy doesn't want another drink, he only wants a soda. Coming right up! You got the ones in the cans? Uh-huh. With the lift-up tabs? Yeah. Susan? Oh. (LAUGHS) Did Roger say anything about last Monday night? Huh? Last Monday night, did he ask you anything about it? What was Monday night? Film series. I had a cold. I know you had a cold. Did he ask you anything about it? What? WOMAN: That's butter... You can't eat that, it's bad. Have some of that. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Can I get you a plate? I wish they would all go home. (CHUCKLES) What's wrong? I never told Roger that you weren't at the movies last Monday. So when you came here today, I thought he might ask you something, uh, whether you liked it or not, and you wouldn't know any better than to answer. Why didn't you tell Roger I wasn't going? Oh, I get it. That guy was there last week. You've been seeing that guy at the movies. There's no guy at the movies. What am I supposed to call him? His name is Tom. Don't worry. I'll cover for you if Roger asks anything. There's nothing to cover! Okay? There's nothing to cover. Then, why are you so nervous? Why didn't you tell Roger I was sick last week? Why didn't you tell Roger I didn't go to the movies last week? MAN: We're going to take off. ROGER: Yeah, okay, Fred. Good seeing you. Take care. FRED: Yeah, you, too. Oh, it is so peaceful here! -Can I get you anything? -No. Oh, it's a lovely party, dear. Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it. You know I appreciate it, don't you? Mmm-hmm. Did Brooke help you out any? She wrote a check, Roger tore it up. (BOTH LAUGHING) He shouldn't have. Oh, I love both my daughters. Brooke is all on the surface and you're the deep one. How those things are decided, I have no idea. Mother, have you ever... What, dear? Have you ever been attracted to another man besides Daddy? (GASPS) What a question! On my golden wedding anniversary! (LAUGHS) I'm sorry. Honestly, Jean, your timing somehow confounds me. Have you? Nope. It was only your father from the first day we met. Didn't you ever look at another man in a mall or... A movie... And just for one moment, wonder what it would be like? Beverly Jean, I don't want to ever hear you talk like that. Oh, but you're only human. It happens to everybody once. Maybe you've forgotten. What are you accusing me of? Nothing. Nothing. I haven't forgotten a thing. I still remember our old telephone number, 43668. We only had five digits then. Well, I'm, going to go see how everybody's doing. -Honey? -Hmm? Uh, can I be honest with you about something? You won't be offended, will you? No, not at all, Mother, what? I don't know if it was your idea or your friend Susan's, but, dear, nobody uses butter anymore. You've been to the market lately? Everything is lite, lite, lite. I'll remember that. Just a suggestion. Thank you. SUSAN: I always do well with tomatoes. Last year, they were coming out my ears. Well, now you have two large red, aroma and a yellow. Don't let me forget peppers. Oh, right here. How did your affair start? Did you see him or did he see you? We worked in the same building. We ran into each other a couple of times. He was flat out direct, didn't mince any words. He said if I wanted to get to know him better, I shouldn't stand on ceremony. (SUSAN CHUCKLES) As if I ever did. I didn't even know his last name till the second time we took the hotel room. Didn't you notice on his credit card? I paid. Oh. He worked in maintenance. When he wasn't at work, he was at the gym. Muscles for days. (SIGHS) Oh, he may not have invented sex, but, phew, he sure improved on it. Okay, that's enough. A person gets bored after fifteen years. I am not bored. How about some stringed beans? Excuse me, but you did start the conversation, Jean. While you're rushing off to change the subject like I was sub-human, may I remind you, you brought it up in the first place? I know. I saw the way you and Tom look at each other. I know what that look means. No, we have not done anything. Well, why don't you? You heard me. Go to bed with Tom. Get it out of your system. They don't arrest you for it, you know? No. But you pay for it in other ways. You should know that. (SIGHS) Guess so. Sure seemed worth it at the time. Senora Townsend. (SIGHS) Where would you like the citrus? Uh, over by the fence, please. Okay. (PHONE RINGING) No, wait a minute. Uh, place it right by the shed. Okay, Jose? Okay. Jean, Tom's on the phone. He wants to talk to you. Jose, I'll count those with you. ROGER: Jean, it's Tom. He needs to talk to you. Maybe you shouldn't call here. What? Who is this? Mr. Reynolds! Hello, Tom! Mildew on your roses, uh-huh. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) SUSAN: I just loved this movie. It's my all-time favorite. Ah! I mush every time I see it. My wild, sweet Cathy. Ugh, makes me weak in the knees. Merle Oberon was so beautiful. The clothes she wore. The woman hardly had a waist. And what a hunk Olivier was. He was a great actor, I never thought of him as a hunk. (SCOFFS) You wouldn't, we would. A major superior hunk. Trust us. Well, I have to get up very early tomorrow morning. Good night, Tom. Glad you could make it this week. Goodnight. Goodnight, dear Heathcliff. -Ah! -Lovely to meet you. You, too. See you next week. He likes you, Jean. No, he's just a nice guy who likes romantic films. I did think you were a little formal, though, "Goodnight, glad you could make it." I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow. -Goodnight, honey. -Bye. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (CHUCKLES) Oops. (SIGHS) -Trouble losing her? -None. She made the light, I didn't. She always says I drive too slowly. I've been looking forward to this all week. I think I know a place we can go. Where? Let me surprise you. I should take my car. I should follow you. Oh, dear. I'm a bit of a klutz when I'm nervous. I didn't make it two weeks in Madame Gregoire's ballet school for girls. Actually to tell you the truth, I'm a bit of a klutz when I'm not nervous. Excuse me. Yes. Oops. MAN: Here you go. JEAN: I was a lousy dancer, but Madame Gregoire was from Atlanta and although I couldn't do a plie, she could not speak a word of French. (CHUCKLES) Would you like something to eat? No. Thank you. Uh, you can. No, I had a sandwich before I left home. Oh, what kind? Oh, scintillating, Jean! (LAUGHS) What a wonderful conversationalist! I'm really so bad at all of this, all this chit chat and small talk. I'm nervous. You're funny. Funny nervous. (SIGHS) I don't know why I'm here. I mean, I do, but I don't. Look, can I say something really dumb? You are very pretty. (CHUCKLES) It's not dumb. Why do you think it's dumb? Well, I couldn't think of a better way to say it. Thank you. I lied to Carol tonight. I told her I was going to the office to work after the film. I hate lying. I know I'm guilty of it myself, but I've always taught Bess to tell the truth, even if it means hurting somebody's feelings. Sparing people's feelings can become a lifelong job, and you lose yourself. I don't want her to spend the rest of her life pleasing others. -Have you? -No. Yeah. A little. Roger's the nicest man I know. He would move heaven and earth for me. He's strong, plays softball. Well, he used to play on the softball team, team broke up. Tell me about Carol. Well, she's decent, caring. She wanted to have a lot of kids. When Kevin was born, there were some complications so we couldn't have anymore, which was a boon for three-legged dogs. I'll explain that. See, there was a time when we had two three-legged dogs. No one else would take them in so Carol did, separately, several months apart. Till they died, they just jumped and hobbled around, happy as they could be. She loves what nobody else does. She's not a saint, but she's very kind. So, that's why I really don't know why I'm here. But you're a bright woman... I was hoping you could tell me. Not so bright, Tom. If I were, I would've run that yellow light and followed Susan as fast as I could. But do you know, to hell with it. I don't think I care. I just wanted to see what that would be like. Just curious? Yes. Still curious? Mmm-hmm. (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) Still curious? I got to go. Well, we solved your curiosity, what about mine? Tom, this has been so much fun. Thank you! -Jean? -Thank you. (DOOR OPENS) What time is it? -JEAN: Midnight. -(GROANS) How do you stay up so late, then get up so early? You're a better sleeper than I am. (CHUCKLES) (DOOR OPENS) -Hi, heard you come in. -Hi. I made a chocolate cake from scratch. I just wanted to see if I still knew how. How about a nice big piece? Price is right. No, thanks. So, what did you see tonight? Wuthering Heights. Ah, my Achilles heel. They assigned that to us in high school. I could hardly finish reading it. I never did see the movie. Maybe I should read the book again. All I remember are a lot of people running around. Ah, what was it called? The moors! Running and crying, and crying and running! (CHUCKLES) I'll just rent the video sometime. Come to bed. -I'll be up in a minute. -Okay. (DIALING) (RINGING) WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Reservation! May I help you? Um, yes, I'd like to reserve a room, please. Uh, certainly. A single or double? A double. Um, for me and my wife. All right, and your name, please. Yeah, it's Doster. Tom Doster. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Doster. Jose, could you help Mrs. Winsinger with her car, please? -Por favor. -Yeah. -Gracias. (CHUCKLES) -De nada. Bye, Bess. Hi, honey! Your Spanish test? How bad was it? -Can we go to the mall? -The mall? Honey, we take you there when you get an A and your daddy and I want to reward you. Well, I'm getting to the age where I need to go to the mall to alleviate depression. Tada! You are 14 years old! I'm almost 15. Luther will love this, it'll drive him crazy! There's no way Luther or anyone else is going to see your chest at age 14. He already has, Mom. Take it off. I wouldn't buy that for you if you were fluent in Spanish. BESS: I know what you're going to say. What exactly have you and Luther done together? It's private, Mom. Yes, it is. It's private between you and him and me. We haven't done anything. A little. Mom, we've talked about this before. There's only reason for a man and woman to have sex and that's because they love each other. Yeah, but sex is not a sport, honey. Sit down here for a second. It's a pleasure, I know that. But it's not something you do for recreation. Honey, I'm not asking you to wait forever. Just wait for someone that you really care about. Did you? -Well, honey, that's... -Private. Bess, listen to me. Love and commitment are the only reasons that you have sex. I know you're having peer pressures. -God... -I know. I don't care about peer pressures! What about my own pressures? What about the fights I have with myself? I mean, sometimes I think I never want to have sex and then other times I think why not just do it and get it over with? Not think about it. But, Mom, the whole thing scares me. Don't you have any feeling for that? Of course I do. I know there's considerations, you've told me 100 times. But, Mom, there's times when I don't care about those considerations, when I just want to say to hell with it! Mom, don't you ever get tired of thinking so much? Sometimes. Well, what do you do then? (SIGHS) I don't know. I haven't figured that one out yet. It'll be okay. BESS: Okay, so, Mom, about the birthday party. Okay, I know that my birthday is not for another month, but... Jean. I need to see you in my office. We'll talk about it later. Close the door. From the bank, 19 checks returned for insufficient funds. What? Uh, no, no, that can't be right. I, um... I, oh, God, I... I wrote the checks and I didn't make the deposit. You've never done that before. I'm sorry. If the book keeping is too much, just say so. I'll help you. You don't have to do it all yourself. Honey, I'm perfectly capable of doing it, I just screwed up! We've never bounced a check since we opened this business. Things like that are important to me! (LOUDLY) They're important to me, too! I'll take care of it. I will call them and I will explain everything. Something's upsetting you. I know you. It's my parents. Um... It takes me time to recover from their visits. Are you still worried about what your folks think? Jean, you're with me. You don't have to worry anymore about that. I know. You know, I think you're the best. (SIGHS) I wish that could be enough for you. It is. It is. MAN: "Darling..." That's me? WOMAN: Mmm-hmm. MAN: "You have a date, my beloved, July the 1st at 5:00." But you don't say where. WOMAN: Well, you name the place and I'll obey. I don't know, I can't think. How about the top of the Empire State Building? Oh, yes, that's perfect. It's the nearest thing to heaven we have in New York. MAN: The 102nd floor, and don't forget to take the elevator. WOMAN: (LAUGHING) No, I won't. WOMAN: Darling, if things don't work out? MAN: Don't talk like that. I'm not listening. WOMAN: But just in case. Maybe he had something else to do. He would've told me. Already started to be considerate of one another. That's nice. I need the ladies' room. (COINS CLINKING) (PHONE RINGING) (CLEARS THROAT) -ROGER: Hello? -Hi! Hey. Movie over? No, I just called to say I love you. (CHUCKLES) Someone... Someone should make a song like that. (LAUGHS) Ah, it's not every woman who'd leave Cary Grant for me. I would, Roger. Bess just went to bed. I helped her with her math. Big help. I would. What? Leave Cary Grant for you. I would. And I'd leave her, too. What was her name? Um... Deborah Kerr, Carr? Jean? Um... I'll see you later. I should go now. Okay. Bye. I was so afraid. I was afraid something had happened and you weren't coming. I'm here. I got a bit of a late start. I, uh, they were working on the freeway, but I couldn't stay away, Jean. I don't care about the movie, I just knew that you'd be here. (SIGHS) I was looking for you all night. Then my mind started to play tricks on me, I thought something happened, I was so scared. No, nothing happened. Listen. I've made some plans. I reserved a room in Hamilton for Friday night. Now it's far enough away. I don't think anyone will see us there. Don't you want to? I've never done anything like that before. Well, I was just asking. Hey, if you don't want to, just say it. Ah, it's just one night. You can make an excuse. Oh, God! Of all of the dumb things to say, and the dumb ways to say it, I... Look, I want you, Jean. I want you so bad. I just want to make this real. I wish I could say that I didn't want you. I wish I could even think it. I wasn't going to come tonight. I didn't get a late start, I wasn't going to come at all. I wasn't going to phone. I was going to stop everything, just disappear from movies, from your life. No. I was going to throw you away. And then I realized how stupid that was. And then I was in the car and then I was here. I'm glad. I'm so glad. Maybe you don't believe in destiny, but I do. I'll meet you, anywhere, anytime. Just tell me where and when, I'll be there. I wish it were now. (SIGHS) You almost finished homework? Almost. You got to tell your father, Kevin. He's going to have to know. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) You're gonna be mad at me, Dad. Is that right? Well, why don't you let me decide that? I did something bad at school today. I stole a calculator from somebody else's desk and my teacher caught me. Did you say you were sorry? Yes. Did you mean it? I guess so. (MUSIC STOPS) You know, the same thing happened to me once. I was in about third or fourth grade, and I stole a book from Ronnie Norman's desk. It was a Hardy Boy book. See, Ronnie was from a rich family. He had all of the Hardy Boy books. I could only borrow 'em from the library. And it wasn't that the book was of great value, just like I'm sure the calculator wasn't. It doesn't even cost ten dollars. Right. But what I didn't know then is that it doesn't matter what the book cost or what the calculator cost, it's the act, and the act was wrong. And I was embarrassed, just like I'm sure you are embarrassed. Well, I'm glad you told me, kid. And I'm glad you were honest. I respect you for that. I promise you, Dad, I'll never do it again. I know you won't, son. -Here you go. -Thank you. Do we have any plans this Friday? I don't think so. Why? Ah, I mean, arboretum in Hamilton called, they're doing those lectures again. They always have these wonderful English gardens. -Hmm. -You mind if I go? Of course not. What time is it? I think 7:00, 7:30. That means it'll be over late. I guess so. I don't want you driving back from Hamilton late and alone. That's fine, I could... I could take a room in a hotel, motel. Yeah, sounds good. Honey. I have to run over to Hamilton on Friday. Mr. Blake is looking at a new site over there and he wants me to have a look. Well, you want a hitch hiker? You could drop me at a mall, any mall. Oh, I'm not sure what the day will bring. Oh, I hate for you to have to drive all that way by yourself. It's only a couple of hours. I have a new Tosca to listen to. Then you better go alone. Why did you marry a low brow like me anyway? I hate opera, I don't read any of the good books. Guess I just married you for the contrast. There's plenty of that. Going to meet Mark. Bye, Mom, bye, Dad. You be careful, Kev. (DOOR CLOSING) Kevin told me what you said to him last night. You know, that's one of the things I love most about you, Tom. You always understand the value of things. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Now, one of the most common questions in buying a rose is whether to buy a bare root or in container. Does anyone here know the difference? Well, let me tell you. A bare root goes directly into your soil. Now you carefully separate the roots, place the rose correctly, ah, that's something else we'll talk about, and fill in with your soil. Now, does anyone know what a bud union is? Ah, yes, young lady, can you tell us? Yes, do you know what a bud union is? The bud union is the heart of the rose bush, it's from the bud union that the major new growth develops, if the conditions are right. Ah, there's one thing you've left out. Hmm. If you live in a temperate climate, the bud union can be placed just above ground level, like so, but if you live in a cold climate... You have to place it beneath the surface where it's hidden. Now, why is that? The rose won't grow if it's not hidden. That's right. Bud union's very fragile. Hiding it protects it against anything that might hurt it. (LAUGHS) (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) -Checking in, sir? -Yes, I am. Do you need help with your luggage? Well, actually, I do have some things in the trunk I'd like you to bring in. Thank you. Coming in now. Oh, Vern, put that between two burners, okay? It's not going to work. Well, it's going to have to, it's the largest one we've got. Roast. -Green beans. -Potatoes. Hi, honey, you want something to eat? It's for sick people. -Oh, excuse me. -It's okay. MAN: Roast. WOMAN: Green beans. (VIDEO GAME NOISES) Turn that off, please. (LOWERS VOLUME) -All the way. -(SIGHS) When are they all going to leave? We lost our kitchen today. It was an old church, and it was sold. They're probably going to tear it down. We found a new kitchen, but we can't move into it until next week. That left us with no place to work, and if we don't work, a lot of sick people won't eat. You don't want that to happen, do you? The food we make is healthy, Kevin. You're not going to catch anything by being around it or around us, or around the people we make it for. Where's Dad? Daddy had to go to Hamilton on a job, he's going to be home really late. (INAUDIBLE) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Climbing Rose nursery. Uh, Yes, Jean Townsend, please. She's not in today. Could I take a... Are you checking in? -Checking in, ma'am? -Yes. MAN: Room 510. I'll take... (BEEPS) WOMAN: Operator. Could I have an outside line, please? Hello? JEAN: Just checking in on everybody. Well, we've had, um, a little emergency. What happened, Roger? I don't really know. She only wants to talk about it with you. Here. Hi, Mom. What happened, honey? Luther's parents are out of town. He wanted me to come home with him. (SNIFFLING) Guess why? I said no. He said, either I slept with him or found a new boyfriend. I'll come right home, right now. (SOBBING) I'm okay, Mom, you don't have to. No, I can. I can and I'll be there in a few hours. Mom! You sound worse than me. I'm okay. You did the right thing, Bess. Mom, I cried all afternoon. (SNIFFLING) That felt really good. And you know what I realized? There's a lot of boys and some of them don't have stupid names. Luther sounds like a dog, which isn't far from the truth. I'm so proud of you, Bess. I wish I was as smart as you when I was your age. I'll see you tomorrow. Sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs get ya. (CHUCKLES) There aren't any, Mom. -Bess? -(SNIFFLING) Yeah? I love you. I love you, too, Mom. (SNIFFLES) Bye. Bye. (SOBBING) (SIGHS) (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN: Operator. Mr. Doster's room, please. (PHONE RINGING) TOM: Hello? I'm here. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's like Christmas. TOM: Well, I wanted it to be beautiful for you. You must have spent a fortune. Well, I spent a fortune on this. I went and got the champagne, the flowers, and everything, and I forgot the glasses. But found these in the bathroom. I'm not... I'm not ready yet. Could we, maybe, take that downstairs? Just for a little while. Sure. We could talk. Yeah. You are the only thing I have been able to think about. I've been walking around the office, and the house, hoping that I was doing a good job faking it. I don't think anyone realized how really far away I was. Why me, Tom? What do you mean? You've met other women before, younger, prettier. You probably had a lot of choices. I don't know. (CHUCKING) Oh, come on, you have. Come on. You've never spent any time with anybody other than Carol? Quick hour in a hotel, couple of drinks? Oh, you probably have, it's just slipped your mind. You're the first. (SIGHS) Roger is the only man I have ever been with. Can you believe that? In this day and age? You probably think I'm weird. No, I don't. I'm... I'm probably what they call an anachronism? Is that right? Anachronism, yeah. Someone who doesn't fit into their time and their surroundings. A '90s woman who has only been with one man. (JEAN CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Roger would cross the earth for me if I asked him to, and he'd never ask why. I love him for that, the way he trusts me. And sometimes I resent him... For trusting me so much. See, I don't only cry in movies. No, thank you. Maybe you'd like to get some air, huh? Mmm-hmm. JEAN: You made the room look like a garden. TOM: Well, I wanted you to feel at home. Thought if I filled the room with flowers, think that you were outside, somewhere off in a forest. I always had a fantasy about making love outside. Have you ever done that? I don't think so, I don't remember. On cool wet grass, with nobody around for miles and miles, in a beautiful garden. (CHUCKLES) I always seem to get emotional in the dark. The darkness of the theater where nobody can see me and... Here. I've wondered how you would feel... So many times. In my mind... I've touched you. Hold me, Tom. (SIGHS) Oh, I'm here. I don't ever want you to go. I don't ever want to be away from you. I don't ever want to be not touching you. Promise me, Tom. I promise you. I'm thinking maybe this is what heaven's like. Warm and safe. I love you. Ah, God, Jean, you are so warm. I've done this in my mind, a hundred times. Hundred times before now. Let's go up. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I can't... I can't do this. -(THUNDER RUMBLING) -It's okay. No, it's not okay. It would be so easy if I didn't love Roger. You want to just come in? No, see, I've never been good at keeping secrets, I'd have to keep this one for the rest of my life. I'm sorry. I'm so scared, I just can't. I'm so sorry. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Jean, wait. We could say we couldn't help it. Couldn't we, Tom? Isn't that what other people say? That something happened, they didn't know what? You hear it all the time. Oh, only if I could stop thinking, just stop thinking for a few seconds. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GROANING) Ow! Oh. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (PANTING) Oh! (GASPS) I don't have the ticket. That's okay. I never forget a car or a face. (PANTING) (SOBBING) (SNIFFLING) (CAR HONKING) (GASPS) (WHIMPERING) (SIGHS) Oh, Jean, what a mess you are. What a mess. Look at her. Look at me. (DIALING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? (SOBBING) Wait a minute, it's okay. It's all right. (SIGHS) (SOBBING) I just came in from the balcony. The sky is so clear after it rains. (JEAN SIGHS) Stars everywhere. Don't see stars very much here. I'm sorry I ran away. Sometimes when we can't find words to explain, we run. (SIGHS) I can't live like this anymore. I'm doing things I've never done, I mean, lying. I'm making up excuses. I think people are seeing how strange I'm acting. (SIGHS) I'm afraid to say anything 'cause I'm afraid it's going to be wrong and something will slip out. Where are you? (SIGHS) Some motel off the freeway. The Bates Motel. (CHUCKLES) (JEAN SNIFFLING) You have a balcony? Yeah. Look up. It's clear. I see the stars. Hold me, Tom. Put your arms around me. You feel them? Mmm-hmm. I'm holding you. From the sea to the sea I'm holding you as close as I can. What do we do now? I wish I knew, Jean. I wish I knew. (SIGHS) Hey, Kev, did you get something to eat? Mom made some chicken before she left. Good. Hey, Dad. Can a man and a woman just be friends? Yes. Why do you ask that? Hey. Come on, you know there's nothing off limits between us. I found this in your car. Business cards and a perfume bottle. Well, Jean went to the film series with me, and I gave her a ride in my car, and as I recall, she accidentally spilled her bag. So, you and her are friends then? Yeah. And I hope we'll always be that. That's all? Yeah, just good friends. Very good friends. I think I understand now. Can I have some ice cream, Dad? Sure. BESS: Uh, Mom, can you pass the vegetables? -Mom? -Yes, honey. Um, can you please pass the vegetables? Oh, yeah. I made dessert. Oh, I'm too fat. You are not too fat. -Roger! You want dessert? -ROGER: Later. Are you going to the movies tonight? Yeah, have to. Last one. All young people think they're fat. You're a six. Do you know how many people would love to be a six? Well, what do you think? Uh? (CHUCKLING) Oh, jeez! York Groove All Stars are going to try again. First practice is this Saturday. Danny Meyer called all the guys, everyone's over their bruised egos. We are ready to bruise them again. Uh, Dad, your pants are split. Oh, yeah. I was hoping, maybe, you could sew it up for me. Sure, when I get home. Is, um, Susan going tonight? Or is she out on an emergency session with her shrink? Susan, yeah, she'll be there. WOMAN: When you were out in the real country, I think it was a few miles beyond Greyfield, we stopped the car just outside a village and got out. There was a little bridge and a stream, and the sun was making an effort to come out, but really not succeeding very well. We leaned on the parapet of the bridge and looked down into the water. I shivered, and Alec put his arm around me. MAN: Cold? WOMAN: No, not really. MAN: Happy? WOMAN: No, not really. I knew exactly what you were going to say. That it isn't worth it. That the furtiveness and lying outweigh the happiness we might have together. Isn't that it? Something like that. MAN: I want to ask you something, just to reassure myself. WOMAN: What is it? MAN: It is true for you, isn't it? This overwhelming feeling we have for each other. It's as true for you as it is for me, isn't it? WOMAN: Yes, it's true. SUSAN: Was Brief Encounter after Gone with the Wind? -What? -Which came first? Brief Encounter or Gone with the Wind? Gone with the Wind, I think. Trevor Howard doesn't look like he did in Gone with the Wind. Trevor Howard wasn't in Gone with the Wind. Leslie Howard was in Gone with the Wind. Really? I never knew they were different people. Leslie Howard, Trevor Howard. Well, what do you know. They're both English, aren't they? They were. They're both dead now. SUSAN: Well, there you have it. It's the way the English talk... (ENGLISH ACCENT) ...from the bottom of their throats. (NORMAL VOICE) They all sound alike. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Of course, you'll talk about me while I'm gone. Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me. I'm not ignorant, you know. Just because I didn't know the difference between Leslie Howard and Trevor Howard, doesn't mean I haven't been well educated. Actually, I was voted most likely to succeed. But I got married instead. (CHUCKLES) It was a lovely movie. Yes, it was. I'd never seen that one before. Yeah, I saw it a long ago, but I remember it being in color. I don't remember it being in black and white. Oh, they didn't seem to film much in color then, but not much, yeah. -Listen, I got a call... -You know, I was thinking... Oh, I'm sorry, you go first. -No, I'm sorry, go ahead. -No, you. I got a call a couple of days ago from a company... SUSAN: That's it for me, folks. It was really nice to meet you, Tom. It was nice to meet you, too. You two stay. I'm tired. No, I... I have to go, too. Goodbye. I mean goodnight. Don't let me break up the party. Oh, it's all right. I think the evening's over. Goodnight. JOSE: Senora Townsend! -Yeah? -Telefono. -Someone named Tom? -Ah. (CHUCKLES) Still having mildew problems, huh? Well, I'm having some problems, but mildew isn't one of them. Oh, I... Look, Jean, I need to see you. I have to see you, too. When? Now. Right now. Um, city park, by the rose garden. (DIAL TONE) Um, Roger? I just got a call and I have to run over to Taylor's to make a bid for some landscaping. Hope they don't need it soon, we are up to our ears. No, I don't think so. I think they've still got to put in their pool. You mind going and picking up Bess after school, if I'm late? Sure. Thank you. See you later. (SIGHS) You have one, too. I don't quite know how to say this. (SOBBING) Oh, come on, Beverly Jean, just say it. I can't see you after this anymore, Tom. I just can't. It's not true, I can, but I won't. I won't. Seems to be the only thing that's right. (SNIFFLING) And I don't mean just right, I mean possible. Are you angry with me? No. You are. I'm moving, Jean. I mean... We're moving, Carol, Kevin and I. I wanted to tell you the other night, but I couldn't. A few months ago I got an offer from a company in Seattle. I turned them down. Last week, I called them back and said if they were still interested, I was. You really have to do that? Move away? Jean, as long as I'm here, I'll find you. And then, I'll drive by your house, I'll go to the same places you go, I'll take all the risks. You know how many times I've driven by your house just in the hope of seeing you? It's the only answer. And after we've been away from each other for a while, our lives will go on. Maybe not right away, but in time. I can't stay. You're a much stronger person than I am and I just don't trust myself that much. Sometimes when you don't know what else to do... You run. Your hair is turning a little gray. Mine, too. Nobody will ever see mine, I'm too vain. I'll wonder what you will look like in years to come. You'll probably turn all silver. Never felt for anyone the way I feel about you, Jean. You have. You've forgotten. You felt it with Carol. I felt it with Roger. When we first met, we were consumed with passion. Every chance we got, every place we could think of, we couldn't get enough of each other. And then, as time passed... Things got more familiar, a little less exciting. We're still physical, but maybe not as much. So, things change, they turn to touching... Little kisses. The quiet things. So maybe they are... Different from when we first met, but in the beginning it was passionate, way beyond the movies. Our problem is our memory. We forgot, didn't we, Tom? We forgot what we really had. When it's not in front of us... We forget that it was really there, but it was. We just have to find a way to get it back again. You and I never made love... But I really don't remember if we did or not. I wanted to give you something, a present, so you wouldn't forget me. I don't need a present for that. -When are you leaving? -Next Saturday. You'll like Seattle. Things grow well in Seattle. They have all that wonderful rain there. -I've got to go. -Please. I'm going to turn and walk away, and when I go, I'm not gonna look back at you. Cause I can't look at you one more time. I love you, Jean. (INHALES DEEPLY) (SNIFFLING) (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSING) Hello! ROGER: I'm in here. Hey. My baseball pants. I told you I'd do it. Yeah, well, I was just sitting here, and I thought it's got to be pretty easy. None of that phony macho stuff for me, so I tried to thread the needle. And I've been trying to thread this needle for the last ten minutes. Oh. (SCOFFS) -You're staring at me. -Mmm-hmm. I missed you. You missed me? (LAUGHS) How could you miss me? We are together every day. I was gone for a little while, but now I'm back. (SIGHS) -Give me those pants. -Yeah? No, not those pants! Give me those pants. (BOTH LAUGHING) ROGER: Got ya.
