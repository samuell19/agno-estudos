Let's end it... Doumyouji. I can't go out with you anymore. Ookawahara Corporation formally nullified its merge with us today. Doumyouji got disowned? Quit joking. I've decided already! That I'll stay by you no matter what. If I back out, will everything go back to normal? Come on, let's go! ...Ken. Hey! Episode 10: The Disappeared Memories Wait!! Move! Move move move!!! Ken!! We should still have more chances to recover. Wait!! Perhaps we should call young master Tsukasa. Pardon? Have you not cancelled the disinheritance? No need for that. My glasses. He will come crying to me soon. I'm home. Eh? What's wrong? Liars! I'm terribly sorry. Huh? I'm really, really sorry young master! What do you mean? Ken!! You're kidding me! What do you mean you haven't been paying your rent? We promised the company we'll pay them back. And we've been paying them back, bit by bit, but Drying seaweeds don't earn you much. So you didn't have enough to pay the rent? When we told them you're dating Doumyouji-san they said we can pay them all back later. Is she really going out with the Doumyouji heir? No offense, but it doesn't look like it to me! Maybe you've been lying and deciving us! What about it? Eh!? You've gotta be kidding me... But it's still true that you're dating Doumyouji-san, right? What's true and what's not? Tell me everything! What's going on? It was all planned out. Eh? To save you from getting too out of line. Our only solution now is a mass-layoff. It's true the mass-layoff was created by your careless words. It's also true that I was laid off because of that. Will you please reconsider? A profitless factory will only drag us down. Madam President, Ken Uchida is a close friend of the young master's. That means nothing to-- Ever since the young master came to inspect my factory, he has also met my family. Nishida? -Yes? Please take your leave. Excuse me. That old hag's plot... Cheers to Doumyouji Corporation! I was asked to play the role of a man ruined by losing his job. But... It was you who I saw jumping off, right? Yes. However Ken! I disappeared like I was instructed to in exchange for being allowed to start a new business in Japan where you won't see me. I'm so stupid. And so I fell right into that hag's trap. And worried myself to death for a whole year. I am truly sorry for what I've done. And Nishida knew about this too. No, no one close to you should have known about this. You've got quite a nerve, making a fool out of me like this. I imagined you've had quite a wonderful year. And then... don't tell me you... Who would've thought your mom would go that far? Shows how desperate she was. Fuck that! Playing with people's emotions like this... I'll never forgive her. Please! Please let me work here! You sure, lady? Sure I'm sure! I'm surer than sure! Hey, calm down! Have you talked to your mom yet? No. You better not be planning something reckless. Don't worry. I won't cause trouble for you guys. Yes! Way to go! Let's see some spirit! Yeah! Respect your life! Warning! Sharp Cliff! Eh? No way! What about Makino? Are you going to go see her? I don't care what happens to Doumyouji Corporation anymore. Well, I'm already disowned anyways. I will start a new life with Makino for sure this time. Oh. Sorry about yesterday, Soujirou. Eh? You were right. Even if you're disowned, you clearly still care a ton about your family name, don't you!? You helpless brat! I lost myself after you pointed out the truth. Tsukasa. Hm? Take these. You've got no money, right? Soujirou... Tsukasa. You might need some cash too, right? Here. Akira. Funny how you always prefer using cash, Akira. That's how I was brought up. Tsukasa. Call her with this. You can take it with you. Sorry about this, guys. What are you talking about? I guess... This is what the saying "Rui and others will attract friends" is about. This isn't how you use it, and you don't need "and others". Eh? But you're right in weird ways. See? I'm a friend to you guys! You can take our helicopter. Hurry up and go. Yeah. All right! Stop! Don't do it, Grandpa. That's dangerous. Aren't you thinking of doing something you shouldn't? Stay back! H-hold on, Grandpa. Calm down, okay? It's none of your business! Leave me alone! Whatever happens to me is none of your concern! It's not! It's none of my concern but it's disgusting!! Huh? You might not think it's much once you jump off, but what about the person who's forced to watch this close by? Grandpa, do you want to make me suffer for the rest of my life? I've already suffered enough! Do you want to make me suffer more? No... I bet you've got a life hella better than ours, with those clothes you're wearing. We eat seaweed every, every, every freakin' day! I bet you won't understand how that feels. What're you laughing about?! Is your family really that poor? Sorry we're the poorest family in Japan! You've got a problem with that? Oh well. Yo! Bro! Where are you guys living right now? Your sister's with you, right? I'm gonna fly to your place this minute! What? Grandpa, you're the company president? We're a tiny company that makes computer parts. But, you're still the president, right? That's amazing. We were trying to sell our parts to lots of places but no one would take us seriously. They won't do business with us just because we're small. This world is full of fools. Full of fools, huh. Of course! This was the greatest invention of the century. Really... You won't believe me either? No, that's not it. But maybe if you love others as much as you love that product maybe something will change. Love others? My dad is irresponsible and sloppy and he even got fired. I, even as his daughter, can think of so many times when he's an embarrassment but There's one thing I admire about him. He never talks bad about others. He's always greatful toward others, and so... he's a hopeless father, but I love him. Looking at Dad, I think the word "thank you" is a magical word. Tsukushi-chan. Hm? I think I'll start over again. Yeah! You shouldn't give up. You're the president, after all. Yeah. Thank you. What is this? What's going on? People heard Doumyouji-san was coming, so they gathered here and started partying. Wait, hold on. Why is Doumyouji coming here? I came to get you. Eh? Doumyouji. Ladies and gentlemen, there's Doumyouji-san! He's right! That's definetly the Doumyouji heir! Are you really going out with Makino family's daughter? I would love to... if she forgives me. Doumyouji... But I've already cut all ties with the Doumyouji Corporation. What? I'm just a man who came to get the woman I love. Wait, Doumyouji-san... Makino Ken was alive. Ken's suicide was one of the hag's plot. Eh? I've gotten completely over the Doumyouji Corporation. I've got nothing now, but Nonetheless, I still want to be with you. Come with me. Enough of this joke! That's not what you said before. Pay your rent! Pay us back! Stop! Move! Susumu! Doumyouji-san! Doumyouji-san!! Doumyouji! Doumyouji-san! Doumyouji-san! Doumyouji-san!

Not for profit at any time! No adjustments or redistribution without OUR permission! His conditions are stable now. However, we cannot lower our guards yet. He got what he paid for! Mistress! It's his fault he disobeyed my orders and did what he wanted. Won't you go see him? I don't care what happens to a son I've already disowned. He got into an accident because he went to see that girl in the first place! How far will he go to scar the name Doumyouji? What do you not like about Tsukushi, Mistress? Everything! Every single thing! However, she's the one taking care of him with all her heart. What are you talking about? Tsukasa has seen nothing but hell since he met her! I imagine he'll finally lose interest in her after this And it'll only be a matter of time before he comes begging to me. Tsukushi! We're about to start soon! Okay. Ma~kino! Hanazawa Rui! Tsukasa woke up! That's cute. Good thing you changed your clothes. Really? Well, I couldn't really see him in those clothes. What's wrong? A lot of people are suffering... even as we speak. Eh? Doumyouji Corporation is still in trouble, aren't they? Who do you think we are? We're the world's top F4. Don't think about anything but Tsukasa right now. Tsukasa sacraficed a lot himself to go get you too, you know. Yeah. I'm getting nervous. Come on. Let's go. There's the star! The results of the examination showed nothing. Sorry to make you worry, Rui. Seriously. You never cease to make people worry, Doumyouji. Huh? Who are you? Eh? You act like you know me. Are you Rui's girl? Huh? What are you talking about? Wait a minute. Who gave you permission to be here? Who...? Don't let some strange girl into this room. Tsukasa, are you making a joke? -Eh? Do you know who I am? Do you know who you're asking that question to?! Then who is she? You're annoying. I already said I don't know! Enough already. I got out of my important work to fly here and see you. What kind of thanks is that? Even idiots have their own way of saying "Sorry to make you worry." How you act dumb like that isn't funny at all! Hey. Throw this retarded girl out of here. Eh? Even if she's Rui's girl, there's certain things I will not stand. Are you being serious, Tsukasa? That's my question. Are you guys making a fool out of me? Memory loss? He may have a partial amnesia. But why... only about Makino? He may have lost that part because he thought about it for too long. He'll get them back... eventually, right? Let's just watch over him for a while. Why only me? You've got to be kidding me!!! Don't get all worked up. I will get all worked up! I'm so mad! I'll go to his room again. Wait, Makino! Sheesh. Ouch! Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. Hey! That was for 398! Eh? That skirt. I have the same one! Oh, I bought one that got marked down even more in a sale. No way! How much was it? What are you doing? Oh, I bumped into her. Nice to meet you. Don't worry about him. He's moody like that. Was that your boyfriend? He's so hot! Well... not exactly... Are you two here to see someone together? Yeah. Will you be coming back again? I'll be here for a while, so let's talk again. It's so boring here. Okay then, see you later. I'm really sorry. It's okay. Oh, my name's Nakajima Umi. Oh, my name's Makino Tsukushi. What are you doing here? You're annoying. Who said you can come in here? Um... Okay, the thing is What? You're in love with me. What am I saying? What I meant was... I hate girls like you! Get lost. You took a direct hit. I'm lost at what to do now. Well, if you keep pushing yourself to come here, he'll remember eventually. Will he? There's no way Tsukasa will forget you. I see. But no matter what I'm just thankful he's safe. The villagers felt so bad for what they've done they said we can stay here for a bit longer. They said they'll even drop our debt. But I told them, that's that and this is this. We will pay them back for our rent in full. You're so cool -So cool! Sis, what are you doing there? Thinking up strategies. Hey. You've never earned a penny yourself. Get off your high horse already! So? Do you remember now? Stop fucking around! I'm sorry!! Guess it didn't work. Felt like I just made it worse. Don't run away from the problem, Makino. Try again! I'm not sure about this next one... Don't worry, you'll do fine. All right, I'm going! Hey, you. Cut it out already. What? Slow down. Don't rush. Walk around. What are you doing? What I mean is... Humming-yay. Huh? Read the book. The book. Are you stupid? It's worse than I thought. No effect, huh. More like, I was so embarrassed I could have died while saying those. And he's been saying those seriously all this time. Let's think of another plan. Time out. I'm so thirsty! Umi-chan, I got these for my get-well gift. Try some. They're really good. Wow, thanks! They look really good! Umi-chan, will you believe it? My son has come to see me! I'm so happy! Good for you! Amazing. She's so popular here. Umi-chan! How many times did I tell you not to have snacks here? I'm sorry! But these were so good! Really? Let me try. But it'll be so lonely after Umi-chan leaves the hospital. I promise I'll come back and see you all even after I get released. Really? Don't forget! Everyone loves you, don't they? You know how it's so boring here? When I started talking to every person I met, I ended up being friends with everyone! You're amazing. No, I'm not! I just think you get well faster when you're enjoying yourself. Um... Don't you meet any patient who are hard to talk to? Yeah... sometimes. How do you talk to those people? Um... I just talk to them without thinking about it much. I don't really know myself. I see. But I guess that's important. The harder I try The more he'll clam up. Hey! Huh? I think he's the one the nurses were talking about. Eh? Nice to meet you! My name is Nakajima Umi. Let's be friends, okay? Huh? There are lots of rumors about you. Sounds like you're someone famous. -Are you- -Careful! If you can't walk, you should use a clutch. What if you fall and break even more bones? Shut up! What's with you? You get on my nerves. Hey you don't have to be so- I don't care if I get on your nerves. What's dangerous is dangerous! I don't care how famous you are. All the patients in the hospital are equal! Okay? Tsukasa. What are you doing? You can't get up yet! Shut up! What's bothering him? His body isn't working the way he wants it to. Naturally he'll be irritated. Who? What? Is she your friend, Makino? Yeah, I met her here yesterday. Nice to meet you. I'm Nakajima Umi. Nice to meet you. You're cute. Do you want to go get a drink or something? Sorry, I need to get back. It's almost time for my check-up. See you later, Tsukushi-chan. -Yeah, see you later. Oh! Was that the person you've been coming to see? Yeah... Then if I go to his room, I'll be able to see you again, right? Y-Yeah, I guess... Then see you around! How nice! So cheerfull and cute! So cheerful you can hardly believe she's an in-patient. I know. She's always smiling. Her smile is as bright as the sun. I hate her. Huh? Hey, wait. I've gotten completely over the Doumyouji Corporation. I've got nothing now, but Nonetheless, I still want to be with you. Come with me. Hello? Sorry I can't go see you. Don't worry. I feel bad about leaving you all by yourself at work too. Nah. By the way, you're over there with Nishikado-san, aren't you? Yeah. He didn't meet any cute girls there, did he? Don't worry about it. I don't believe you! Did he ask a girl to take a trip around the beach and let her ride on his motorcycle? He didn't. I'm telling you, don't worry! Besides... we've got our hands full with Doumyouji. What? Doumyouji-san still can't remember you? Yeah... I feel like Every time I see him, I get stiff. Like I'm always frowning. My eyebrows draw closer, and I tell myself I need to keep smiling. I really do, but... Umi-chan? Hey, let's practice together. Practice? I don't need practice! I'll teach you! I'm an expert at it. Hey! Tsukushi-chan! Umi-chan, you got released from the hospital! Yep! See, it's all better. I came to thank everyone today. I see. But Tsukasa-kun is so funny! Eh? Hey! Don't call me like that! Why not? You are Tsukasa-kun after all! Shut up! You're so... What's wrong with you? Tsukushi-chan comes and you suddenly get so irritated! You're being rude to her. None of your business. Smile. Smile. Hey! Let's all go to the roof! I think it'll make you feel better. No thanks. Come on, let's go get some fresh air! Then you go yourself. Come on, let's go! Hey, don't pull! It still hurts! Oh, yeah, sorry. Hey, Tsukasa-kun I think you won't be able to live without me for now. No way. I can walk by myself. That way. Come on, come on. I said don't pull! It feels so good! Why don't you come over here too, Doumyouji? The view is awesome! There you go again, ignoring her! Shut up. You won't get better if you look so serious all day. There's something I can't remember. Eh? According to the doctors, I have memory loss. Memory loss? For example, I remember coming here. But I can't remember why. I feel like it was something incredibly important though. Like... to see someone? To see... someone...? Who did I come to see? That person is...! -Who cares who it is. Maybe you came to see someone, and maybe not. I don't think you need to force yourself to remember. Umi-chan... It seems you have lots of friends And you'll make plenty of new friends from now on. You'll just have to fill up the holes with other stuff. Think of it like resetting your life. Resetting life? Maybe the thing you can't remember wasn't significant in the first place. But the more you try to remember, the more you fool yourself into thinking it was significant. Don't stop. Eh. Don't stop trying to remember that something. I... Stop it. That's the worst kind of stress you can put on a patient, Tsukushi-chan. ...Sorry. You're right. Tsukushi-chan. I'm so selfish... Makino, how's Tsukasa doing? He's on the roof right now. By himself? With Umi-chan. I see. Hey, Makino, are you going home? Hey! What's with that woman? I don't get her at all. Don't say that. She's worried about you too. Is she your friend? Eh? I... guess, yeah. Tell her to stay away from me. Oh. Okay. Tsukasa. Hello -Hi. Hi -So? Did you remember something? Oh, we were just talking about that, too. I don't think he should force himself to- A stranger should stay out of this. Eh? I'm talking to Tsukasa. Oh, sorry. Can you make yourself disappear? You're getting on my nerves. Hey, no need to be that harsh. Don't worry about it. What's gotten on your nerve? Think about how Makino feels! How she must be feeling as she comes here everyday, How hurt she must be. Tsukushi-chan. Sorry about earlier. It's okay. Is... Eh? it you that Tsukasa-kun has forgotten about? ...Yep, it is. You two were going out, right? You told me your boyfriend was in the hospital. Well... Sorry about what I said. I didn't know. It's my fault too, for not making it clear. But... I'll help you! I'll help you get Tsukasa-kun's memory back! But... Tsukasa-kun is slowly opening up to me, and I think he'll open up completely soon. You and I, in the land of dreams~ We held a wedding, in a small church by the sea~ Oh, man... -What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing at all. How's Doumyouji-san? Same as always. Is there anything I can do? It was my fault in the first place. I don't know... How about I make something good to take along when I go see him? Eh? Good morning... He's asleep. Remember... Makino Tsukushi You will remember Makino Tsukushi... Remember... Makino Tsukushi... Makino Tsukushi... Remember... Remember... Oh, Hanazawa Rui? I don't know but I have a feeling he'll remember me this time. Oh, did I wake you up? Yo. It's past noon already. Did you have any good dreams? Yeah... I was laughing and talking with someone. Oh, really. But I can't see the face. Like I've been saying, don't force yourself. I'll go change these flowers. Huh? Thanks for your hard work! I wonder if he ate my cookies. Tsukushi! You forgot these! You're so sloppy... Sorry! Hey, that's a nice necklace you got there. What's wrong? You look scary. Tsukasa-kun? These cookies tasted like love. Is the person I've forgotten... You? Were we going out? You made these didn't you? Next week, The shocking finale! 1-hour Special!! Do you know something I don't? What are you planning to do next? Fuck you! I love Tsukasa-kun. Doumyouji is gone! If she gets lost, she'll definetly die out there. Tell us clearly! It was Tsukushi-chan who changed Tsukasa this much. Oh well! Let's just say a success to luring Umi-chan away! She'll never be better than Makino. Right now, the person missing is identified to be Makino Tsukushi-san. That little girl... Dammit! Will I die like this?
