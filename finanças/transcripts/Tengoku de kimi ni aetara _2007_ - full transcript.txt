"Based on a true story" Papa! Darling, the wind's great today. Bye-bye, Papa. See you again. Bye, Papa. 'Til next time. Bye, darling. This isn't the story's end... but its beginning. The story of the day... my parents get to meet again. "Life: Tears in Heaven" It's a complete con. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Did you say something? Some pro-windsurfer. You're just a dreamer. Tour of the world's surf spots? Wild goose chase, more like... Listen, if you prefer life in some office... you wouldn't meet the people, experience the cultures we do... You only live to race. No holidays, no Christmas... We never even had a proper wedding. It's downright fraud. You're the fraud. Supposedly a great cook but all we eat is fried egg. Because we can't afford to buy meat. Experiment with veggies, then. I do. It's no use. There's nothing around here. We're doomed. We'll starve to death. My dad is a wind-rider. If surfers are wave-riders, windsurfers ride the wind. He says they ride the sky as high as the wind goes, soaring to their hearts' content. "With direction of travel perpendicular to the z axis," "the reduction of the submerged board area..." "thus affects water resistance relative to board speed." No idea what it means. We just do what feels good, eh? Hiroko, water? Don't have any. Hiroko, you're amazing. Most pros' girlfriends quit after a while. Fed up for lack of cash or free-time. Natsuki, you spend 6 months a year on the road? 300 days. Including travel, it's 365 days. A total surfing maniac. Stop it. You're as bad, Shinoda... Right, he's just the same. Not at all. I just hop over to Hawaii when I feel like it. I'm amazed you stick with him. How do you keep it up? Pro in name only, he paid his own way on the competition circuit. Prize money was a pittance... not that he won any. They were always dirt poor. Hiroko, get a pen. Pen and paper... I've got a great race plan. It's foolproof. If it's overcast, stay tight in to shore... Papa battled on with complete faith in himself. Natsuki, you can do it, darling. Natsuki, you can do it. But the bar was set very high. Without rival in Japan, on the world stage, he struggled. Our power's cut off. How about our water... Thank god for that... Welcome home. You haven't pay me rent for 6 months. I'm sorry. He will have a race next week, so we can pay you. But he had to win before make that money, right? Yes, he will win. Come on, you know what? What he is doing is having a fun, it's not a job. He will win. Get out. Come on. Let's go. It's not a camping area! Why not take a break? I'll do one more round. You've been competing back to back, recently. If I lose the next race, I'll quit. I'll try one more round. "World Cup in Australia" It was the world championship. Papa made it to the final round. Hey, Natsuki! Mr. Todo, nice to see you. How have you been? Mr. Todo fathered the sport in Japan and was its first ever pro. He was my Papa's teacher. Good luck out there. I'll try but I'm exhausted. - We'll be cheering. - Thank you. How's your form? Aiming for the world's top slot. Same as ever. I always envied your spontaneity. "Spontaneity"... is that a good thing? You're both doing well, Hiroko. Camping and motels? That's a tough life. I'm worried about Natsuki's health. He puts on a brave face but he's not sleeping. I'm more worried about you. I'm tougher than I look. My husband and I always wonder how you put up with it. I think of it as tough love. It's tough but it's love. I want to support his dream. Maybe it's something to do with being abandoned. By your father? He left me in the middle of the city. The first time I met Natsuki... he said he'd never let go of my hand. The very first time? Sounds kind of sappy now but... Not at all. I'm going to nail it tomorrow. No matter how windy, I'll use my 280 board and 29 or 33cm fins. With 6 or 6.5 sails, I'll be perfectly rigged. I'm ready for any conditions. I've just got to keep pressure on the other guys. Sounds so formulaic. I was hoping to see your spontaneity in action. Don't over-think things. You're not the calculating type. Don't think... feel the wind and the waves. Rely on your spontaneity to fight. Let the final game begin! And there goes the start of the final heat. The wind is 25 to 30 knots from the inside shore. Very sunny but very windy condition. On the first position is US-34 Mike, Good luck! Third Kathy Robinson, fourth US-3 Kenny Prittchard. And the only Japanese competitor on the 7th place is... J-1 Natsuki Iijima. It's a very condition, but once you catch the wind you'll be in a good spot. Oh, looks like Kazuki is catching a fresh wind! Will he get to the 5th? Oh my god! He's past in. Oh my goodness he's in 4th place! And now its Mike, Dior, Robinson, Kazuki, and Kenny. Natsuki is in a real good spot now. Had an interview with Natsuki before the race. And he really have his heart into this race. And now, Mike in lead, group is going into the second part. It?s quite even on the tough spot, in the pre-heat, coming into the finals. Oh, Dior and Robinson got a crash. Mike leads, Kenny on second, and Natsuki on third. Standings, US 34 Mike, behind him second and third, Kenny and J1 Natsuki. Go, Natsuki, go! Natsuki is heading to Mike. And now, Mike gets to the third part. Last year?s world cup champion, Briney "Don" Graft. And Natsuki is getting close to Kenny now. Passing the third part. Now, there goes Kenny and Natsuki. Oh Natsuki is starting to go inline, Oh, oh he gets it! He gets to get in second. With the heat almost finish the question is can he reach Mike? It's really serious, ladies and gentlemen. Natsuki trying to get more speed, before Mike get to the finish. He's got to catch more wind. Now coming to the fourth part, There goes Mike US-34, followed by J-1 Natsuki. Mike getting more speed, Natsuki trying to go after Mike! He's getting more speed, I mean he's reaching Mike! Crushing waves, it's Mike and Natsuki. Natsuki has reached Mike, Oh! Yo! Samurai! Check it out right behind the lead, as they reach the final mark! And Mike still trying to catch wind. Can he catch more wind! Pulling back, pulling back, It's Mike and Natsuki almost sharing lead. Oh my god! Oh my god! Natsuki's catching more wind. Oh my god! Toe to toe. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I can't believe it! Natsuki! Yes, Natsuki passed Mike! Natsuki leads as they reach the final stretch! Can he do it? Can he do it? It's Mike and Natsuki. Oh my goodness! Can you see? Can you see? Can you see, who will win? I don't believe it... Can it be? The first in Australian games! Natsuki Iijima is the champion. He's number one. He did it, he did it. I made it. Papa made it to the winner's podium at last. Remember the first time we met? I decided to marry you the next week. No way. It only took me 3 days. What took you? Thank you for everything. You'll stick with me, right? Provided you don't let go of my hand. I promise. This one's hand, too. I've got my hands full. What? Never someone to plan ahead... he had four kids in quick succession. A baby brother, guys. And continued to win. "Samurai Iijima" "Natsuki Iijima, a first for Japan" "Iijima's daring win" "Iijima" Go ahead, kids. He bought a big house for us all. Big smiles everyone. Hang-loose. Happy birthday, Konatsu. Happy birthday, Sis'. Okay, open your eyes... A bicycle... You wanted one, right? Thank you Papa. Thanks everyone. - Konatsu. - You can do it, Sis'. She's got it. Keep at it. I should go. Papa's off. Let's say goodbye. Sorry, Konatsu. I'm going. Good luck. We'll be cheering. Papa! When do you get back? Next week, I guess. The week after is parents' day at school... I have to be in Europe. Ask Mom... But I'll bring presents, okay? He was always away competing worldwide... and was hardly ever home. Mom, that's dangerous. Go back inside. I'll help you. Look after the boys. I'll be right there. Mom, are you okay? It's all right. Just a black-out, nothing to worry about. Konatsu, get a candle. From the kitchen, quick. Mommy's here, don't worry. Don't worry. Don't be scared, Mommy's here. Mommy's here, it's okay. I'm home. Big storm by the look of it. The Caribbean was gorgeous. Hey, Konatsu. Don't shut the door. Who are you? Nobody answered the phone, so I jumped on the first plane. Where's Mom? Please don't just barge in. Konatsu. What happened? I fell off a ladder. Are you okay? I'm fine. It's nothing serious. Papa, welcome home! Were you scared? Not at all. Did you get hurt? No, I'm okay. I brought presents. Tamaki, let's go see. Let's play with them. Come on, Tamaki. Let's go outside. I got the perfect board for you. Let's go out tomorrow. I hate windsurfing. What the heck? Just 'cause I missed a hurricane? On parents' day... you were the only father not there. Tough luck, I was competing. In her school play... do you know what role she had? In the sport's day race do you know her result? That's what it's about. Anyway, how was the race? I'm not on good form these days. Were you really competing? Your name... it's not on the list. I didn't see it in the Oregon race last month. Tell me where and who. You think I'm fooling around? Not necessarily. But I know you're not winning. It's so pathetic. Why not tell me the truth? Don't just run away. I'm not running away. My Papa, the champion Konatsu. Konatsu. Hi, Bob, did you see Konatsu? Yes, I just saw her riding her bike to the park on the hill. Thanks. Konatsu. Konatsu. Konatsu. Come down. You must be starving. I'm sorry. Let's go home. I'm staying like this until you come down. Really, she's not there? Okay, sorry to bother you. Lower your hand, please. I promised your mom. Come to me, Konatsu. Come on. Papa... Papa... They took him to a nearby hospital. But somehow he had to go to Japan for more tests. Scanning underway. Long time, no see. Are you well? I'm good. I heard you had some tests. News travels quick. I'm waiting on the results. It's 'cause you don't look after yourself. You still on the World Cup circuit? But doing no good these days. I feel like I reached my limit. But I keep hanging on. All things come to an end. That's just natural. One of these days, let's ride the waves together. I'm talking about "Jaws". It was our promise. When we retire, we try to ride the monster. Those are 60 foot waves, you know. I'll head over there in November. Be ready to wait as long as it takes 'til "Jaws" breaks. Great! Let's do it. Thank you. When's Papa coming back? When? Don't know. Thank you. Why go all the way back to Japan for the tests? It's not just his lungs, his liver too, so we wanted a thorough check up. Mommy, congratulations. Congratulations. What's the occasion? Mother's Day. Thank you. That's so sweet. Did you make it together? I'm so happy. It's lovely. Does it suit me? - One for you, too. - Really? - It's Papa. - Papa's calling. Is it him, I wonder? A Mother's Day message, I bet. What does it say? Show us... What does it say? I have to tell you something. Brace yourself and read on. They found a softball-sized tumor on my liver. I'll call you when I know more. Show me. What did he write? - What's Papa doing? - Show me. - Hurry! - Show me. The tumor is a liver cell cancer. "Epithelioid Angiosarcoma" to be exact. It's extremely rare. Is it curable? Let's operate then choose a treatment... Is it curable? Let's make it so. It's so weird... why me? I'm in good shape. Never got sick as a kid. Don't worry. We'll beat it. Operations are successful these days. Exactly. So don't worry. You're the worrier. Not at all. Konatsu, lend a hand. Wipe the dishes. Why do I have to come back to Japan? Papa explained it, right? But why? He's got cancer in his tummy and they'll take it out. What's cancer? It's like a big pimple. A pimple? I had a pimple up here. I remember. But I knew full well cancer was nothing like a pimple. Papa's tired out... Not a breath of wind... Excision of the liver's left lobe, everyone. Let's start. Scalpel. Suction. More light. Gauze. Kelly forceps. More suction. Blood pressure 80. Pulse 80. Blood loss? Suction 800cc. Gauze 400. Cusa suction. Don't tug on the tumor. - Look... - 130 stitches! Amazing, huh? Wow. Did they get the pimple out? Most of it. It was a big op. You look great. Should be fine, right? It's me, after all. Listen to him... Tamaki, come here. You want to go to Papa? I'm glad your husband didn't see me like this. He wanted to come. Said he'd have a laugh. How are things? Out-patient chemo, then we'll see how it goes. You'll go bald? Tough luck. Not with liver treatment.
