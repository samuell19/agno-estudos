NOBODY WANTS TO DRINK ALONE. WOW. YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS REMINDS ME OF A GUY I KNEW A WHILE BACK. ABOUT A YEAR AGO, SEE, HE WAS HIDING IN HIS GARAGE, CHUGGING DOWN A SIX-PACK OF BREW. HIS MOM SHOWS UP AND SUDDENLY NEEDS TO GO TO THE STORE. HER CAR'S BROKEN, AND, UH, OF COURSE, SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT HER SON IS DRUNK OFF HIS REAR END. AND HE'S NOT GONNA TELL HER, RIGHT? SO, HMM, WHAT DOES HE DO? HE DRIVES MOM TO THE STORE. EXCEPT, OF COURSE, HE'S SO LOADED THAT HE MISTAKES A TELEPHONE POLE FOR A 3-WAY INTERSECTION AND -- POW. OH, GOD, NO MORE SWEET RIDE. LUCKY FOR HIM, THE AIRBAG ON HIS SIDE OF THE CAR WENT OFF. HIS MOM... WASN'T SO LUCKY, THOUGH. IN FACT, SHE WOUND UP BREAKING HER NECK AND LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE A WHEELCHAIR WITH HER MOUTH. SOME STORY, HUH? >> THEY SUSPENDED MY LICENSE. >> OH, I BET. HEY, THAT'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN THE WOR PART. THE WORST PART IS THAT YOU -- NO, I MEAN, THIS GUY THAT I KNOW -- FELT SO BAD ABOUT CRIPPLING HIS OWN MOTHER THAT HE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY -- NOT HIS FRIENDS, NOT HIS TEAMMATES, NOBODY. JUST LET ALL THAT GUILT ABOUT POOR OLD MOM BUILD AND BUILD. >> HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? >> I CAN READ YOUR FACE. I'M PRETTY GOOD AT THAT. AND, FRIEND, OH, YOUR FACE IS LIKE A SIGNED CONFESSION. [ HEART BEATING ] YOU DEFINITELY NEED A DRINK. [ CORK POPS ] WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF, TODD? LOOK, THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. AND JUST LET ME GO ON RECORD BY SAYING THAT THE DAMAGE -- IT WASN'T EVEN YOUR FAULT. YOU'RE JUST A KID, RIGHT? KIDS DRINK ALL THE TIME...

IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE HOUSE SETTLING. >> I HEARD MUSIC. >> AH, SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S A LITTLE ANXIOUS TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS. I NEED TO SEE THAT INVITATION, BARTOK. HMM, KIND OF AN UNUSUAL THING TO BE ON AN INVITATION, DON'T YOU THINK? I MEAN, GOD, WHAT IS THAT? [ SIGHS ] IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER, IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A VIDEO-GAME CONSOLE. >> I DON'T KNOW. COULDN'T TELL. >> YOU COULDN'T TELL? YOU SURE? >> LOOK, I GAVE YOU THE INVITE. CAN YOU JUST TELL EVERYONE TO STOP MESSING WITH ME AND COME OUT NOW? THIS ISN'T FUNNY. >> [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THE VIDEO-GAME CONSOLE THAT YOU STOLE LAST SUMMER. >> WHAT? >> "WHAT?" I MEAN, GOD, YOU'D HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. YOU REALLY WANTED IT, BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GET IT, SO YOU SWIPED IT FROM THE MALL. RINGING ANY BELLS? >> NO. AND IF YOU TRICKED ME INTO COMING OUT HERE JUST SO YOU COULD PLAY SOME INFANTILE GAME WITH ME, I'M GONNA -- >> WHAT? [ Chuckling ] CALL THE POLICE? WELL, HERE'S AN INTERESTING FACT. THE POLICE COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHO TOOK THAT VIDEO GAME FROM THE STORE. OH, SURE -- THEY KNEW IT WAS SOMEONE ABOUT YOUR HEIGHT AND YOUR BUILD, BUT, UH, THEY COULDN'T SEE THE FACE. AND, UH, EXTRA LUCKY FOR YOU, THERE HAPPENED TO BE A KID HANGING AROUND THE STORE THAT FIT THAT DESCRIPTION PERFECTLY -- A KID WITH A RECORD. OH, SURE, HE KNEW YOU HAD DONE IT. HE EVEN TOLD THE COPS THAT YOU DID IT. BUT WHO ARE THEY GONNA BELIEVE -- SOME JUVIE-HALL BURNOUT OR SOME HONOR-ROLL STUDENT LIKE YOURSELF? >> THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! >> OH, IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. I MEAN, THIS KID GOES BACK TO JUVIE... AND HE KILLS HIMSELF. AND YOU OWN A BRAND-NEW VIDEO GAME, FREE AND CLEAR. EXCEPT...IT'S NOT QUITE FREE AND CLEAR, NOW, IS IT? DID YOU EVER EVEN TAKE THAT THING OUT OF THE BOX? EVER PLAY WITH IT? I BET IT'S STILL HIDING AWAY IN YOUR CLOSET, BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU PULL IT OUT AND TRY TO FIRE UP YOUR FAVORITE VIDEO GAME, ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IS THAT KID'S FACE. [ SIGHS ] DO YOU KNOW HOW HE KILLED HIMSELF? HE MADE A NOOSE OUT OF A BEDSHEET. [ SIGHS ] KIND OF LIKE THIS ONE. >> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT? >> [ SIGHS ] YOU'VE HAD THIS PLAY OVER A MILLION TIMES IN YOUR NIGHTMARES, AND NOW... I'M GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR REAL.
