A film restored in 1990 by Ren?e Lichtig. I have killed! Drama by Roger Lion, made by the author, with Miss Frances Ghuihan. Professor Dumontal, a scholarly orientalist... The worker always tireless, despite warnings of a weak heart. Huguette, his young wife. G?rard, their only son, their pride and joy... It's not very nice that you never go out with me at night. Come on, get dressed... There's still time! And you, you'll be late. Go without remorse, dear little Huguette. My only joy is to see you happy. Each week, Professor Dumontal gives a lecture on the Far East at the Galli?ra museum. Huguette, following a custom that is very dear to her... As you wish, before returning home we will make a tour of old Montmartre. That morning, a stranger... Hid?o... My purse... give it to me, thief... and right now! I was not wrong! It's my Tokyo antiquarian! Mr. Dumontal! My wife will be so happy to see you again. Seeing a talented artist whose friendship was precious to us when we were in Tokyo. I will answer for the honesty of this man. Hid?o remembers the distant dream... This is our son, G?rard. You must come see us soon. Promise! In Huguette's happiness, a cloud. In her past life, one blemish... ... which two wretched characters take advantage of. V?rian, an adventurer... and the supposed Baroness de Calix, his accomplice... You have an infallible weapon against her: her letters. The time has come to use them. If you falter... ... I will be the one to act. Hello? Is that Mr. Dumontal's residence? Mrs. Dumontal, please... On behalf of Mr. V?rian. It's very urgent that I see you... Is Thursday alright? I must insist. I don't know... if I'll be free... if I can... I know what your... shrewdness will dictate. Professor Dumontal's house, Neuilly. On the right, service entrance. Mom... wait. I'll look for her. We understand your grief, Hid?o. You have left there your house, your home... No, there I have left only misery, devastation and death. Over our heads, fire... ... Under our feet, the yawning chasm... ... and among those there... ... my loved ones, everyone. Then, alone in the world, destroyed by the catastrophe, I boarded a liner that brought me to Anvers... In a suitcase I hurriedly gathered some objects d'art, the most beautiful. Two men, who, too late I understood... were scoundrels... Sir, would you like me to recommend a hotel? Hotel Porpoise. Two floors, moderate prices, good cuisine. The hotelier lets us serve ourselves. That woman, without hair... Why? An illness? Yes, a contagious disease: Fashion. My suitcase! Where is my case? Then... I came to Paris. Determined to protect the little money I had left. I've led a miserable life. I'm alone, I'm poor and I'm lost... Hid?o, would you like to accept our hospitality? I have started an important work on Japanese art and I will need a collaborator... that is a friend. Thanks to the hospitable offer, Hid?o had a small workshop... ... and a great friend. It's that nasty man who always comes to see mom. Oh how I hate him! I'll teach you boxing and he won't come back! Why didn't you come yesterday, as I had asked? Do you know the story of Prince Hasaki? It's very beautiful! Listen. You will come tomorrow. It is no longer a plea, although it is not yet a threat. The Mikado had a pearl, unique in all the world. A man with a black soul and conscience introduced himself into the palace to steal the treasure. Daring to come here... like a thief! But hidden, Prince Hasaki watches over the master's treasure. You know I cannot defend myself... Ah, you are just a coward! Listen and remember. Later you will understand what the words loyalty and devotion mean. You will come tomorrow. You are too worried about your reputation to refuse. The next morning... It's her. It can't be anyone else. I have a sudden commitment, I'm sorry I cannot visit you today. Enough wasted time! She must understand and submit. Come with me without concern: I'll follow you along the way. Your hand I can't touch come what may, Friend, know I am solitude Hid?o, I would so like that in our friendship you would find a little forgetfulness and tranquility. I follow my route... without looking back. Sometimes, on the arduous path, a light both sweet and pure... a perfumed breeze... And deep in the thicket, a rose. We breathe... we dream... we pass. It's Mr. V?rian... He insists that Madame receives him. Again that naughty bird that calls mom "Huguette". Am I obliged to come here looking for the interview you're trying to avoid? This persecution is hateful! I've had enough! I beg you to leave! Huguette, it's me persecuted by you. Me who is tortured by your indifference. Am I guilty for loving you? If you loved me, you would respect my life as a wife and mother. If these arguments leave you indifferent, I have others... whose reading would interest your husband very much. You would not commit such abominable offence!! Go find your mother, fast. Do you understand? You won't manage to trick me! What I want, I will have... Think of Mr. Dumontal's health. His weak heart... Such a revelation! You are not a murderer. You wouldn't do that! No... if you are reasonable. Accept the appointment I ask for. Dine with me one night... in Montmartre. Or... those letters... Mom, they're calling you. Hurry, quickly! The dressmaker! Madam... I feel that a misfortune threatens you. Right now, that man... I beg you, make use of me, of my life. Oh, what could you do for me? At the Auteuil racecourse. Without the knowledge of Mrs. Dumontal, Hid?o starts his own investigation. The Baroness, habitu? of the turf, in the company of a friend of V?rian, another adventurer who calls himself Count Ricardo... It's 8, Flower Shadow, an outsider! What will be will be. Isn't that true, ma'am? Yes. I lost. Oh, nothing much! Fifty. And you? Less than nothing... fifty thousand. Let me introduce myself: Viscount Ossumya... Would you do us the honor of accepting a seat in our car? Now, Hid?o leaves his workshop. Isn't your great friend here? The Baroness showed a keen interest in this oriental gentleman who knows how to lose fifty thousand without losing his sang froid. Hello? One question... Is Viscount Ossumya staying at the Ritz? Well, quite so, ma'am. A few days later, at the Isba Russe cabaret. Terrorized, Huguette Dumontal has had to agree to accompany V?rian. Following his plan, Hid?o does nothing to discourage the Baroness. My letters... You promised! Not here. At my house. Don't worry. You have my word. Let's go to my house. I will give you... what we have agreed. The Baroness thinks that she will finally have the "affair" of her life. Champagne! You have a charming little nest. Yes, charming... but maybe... too lonely... Verian has lied and leads Huguette to the Baroness's house. This photograph...? Yes... he is my brother. Suddenly she realizes the terrible danger... You get out and open up first, so that nobody sees me at your door. I will follow you. Driver, fast... To Neuilly! You do not understand that I am... that I... that you are very dear to me? What are you doing here? By what right does this man interrogate me? Don't you recognize him? He is... my brother. That's alright! Enough of this pretence! Your two timing will cost you dearly! For heaven's sake! It's not my fault. This man... has forced his way in! I do not doubt, sir, that you will be willing to make amends... Amends... choose your weapon? At your command! A duel, with a stranger... never! There is another way to make amends... if however you accept... But I do not have much on me... ten thousand francs. I do not want to give this affair more importance than it demands... And in fact... that sum... The damage does not deserve to go beyond... Poor fools! I am no more a Viscount than you are a Baroness, nor richer than you are honest! I wanted to see what was behind this facade. I've no doubts... It's a dirty business! I know of the disgraceful blackmail of Mrs. Dumontal. Some good advice: leave Paris; the air is unhealthy. Haven't you understood? Let me explain. Either you disappear from Mrs. Dumontal's life, or you'll go to jail. The choice is yours! Simple, easy to remember and to meditate on: To Jail. A few days later, a party at the home of Professor Dumontal. ... 8... 9... 10! To the land of dreams! How dare you come here tonight? Are you determined to ruin me? Not in the least. I bring what you refused to accept the other night. The means to end all this. Come on, no more tears! I'll go and look for mom. Who is that? A friend... very good and faithful. G?rard has fallen whilst playing. If Madame could come a minute... And now, sweetie, it's time for beddy-byes. Oh, don't go... Stay, mom! The little devil has torn my dress! I can wait no longer, do you understand? Let's finish it now! Leave! Oh, leave, I beg of you! What it was I promised, I do not give... I sell. I ask for little in return... a souvenir. That little "Satzuma" is a unique piece. I will bring it to you. You wretch! Murderer! Shut up! Silence, or the child will pay! A doctor! Run! Hello? The police station... hurry! Ten minutes? I understand. We will keep him here. Please, ma'am... Did you see it. Speak... Him!... Guilty?... No!... Let him go! But that knife... In his hand! A murder?... No!... I swear it! My poor husband has died of the illness he suffered from... his heart. The Commissioner of Police... Do you persist, ma'am, in your first statement? Please answer? I've told the truth. My husband has been ill... for a long time... Through knightly devotion and to save Huguette's honor, Hid?o allows himself to be accused of Dumontal's death. Three months later, in court... The Judge. In my opinion, this woman knows the truth. And this truth, Mrs. Dumontal is not the only one who knows it. The accused, will you stand. You have heard the witnesses. What do you have to say? I went there... to steal. Surprised, I wanted to attack him with the knife... but he disarmed me. Then... It was me... me alone.... I have killed! Mrs Dumontal, you have heard the defendant's confession. Do you insist that death was accidental and due to a heart condition? Gentlemen of the jury, do not fail to appreciate the attitude of a woman who defends the murderer of her husband. Sit down! Call the next witness. You were in Mr. Dumontal's house on the night of the crime, is that not so? Indeed, I... was there, yes, My Lord. Do you recognize this hat and this coat as belonging to you? By chance I happened... to be present... at the drama... I lost my head... and I fled... The accused has confessed his crime! He has confessed! This man is the murderer! I saw it! You scoundrel! He lies!... The truth!... I will tell it all!... He lies! That wretch, has for months been following me, persecuting me. Wanting, through his reign of terror, to extract money from me. It was he, he who killed. Strangled my husband in front of me! He is innocent! I swear! Listen... Hid?o... out of loyalty, sublime devotion. He has sacrificed himself for honor... for my honor! Alright, yes... I confess! I was the one who killed him! But you must know the whole truth! The truth... of this woman who speaks of honor! A few days later... Why have you abandoned me at the very moment when my poor heart asks for protection against grief and loneliness? Who are you writing to, Mom? Subtitles: Euard48, corvusalbus
