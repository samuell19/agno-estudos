Sunday, 26 August Wow! There it is. Boo...! Hello! - You're finally here. - Sorry. - What took you so long? - I missed the train. - You could've texted me. - There was no reception, so I took the next express train. - What's up? - Just checking my bags. Is something missing? - I ate while I was waiting for you. - That's OK. There's watermelon in the fridge. - Watermelon. - I mean, what's going on? Something missing, isn't it? My passport. - I can't find my passport. - What? Are you kidding? I had it this morning, but I can't seem to find it now. - Let me have a look. - I know it was there this morning. Sakuko! You're all grown up! Has it been that long? - Want some watermelon? - No, thanks. Mizuho! Mizuho, I found it! Oh, where was it? On the floor in the hall. Hey, Ukichi! - Mikie, good to see you. - What's up? Just helping out. He's taking me to the airport. My sister's still got you driving her around? Tell me about it. I've had 30 years of this! Don't put it like that. It's just once in a while, right? Let's catch up later. You were in primary school the last time I saw you. You saw her in Tokyo that time. It was when you came to see Toshie's gallery in Ginza. Wasn't she still in primary school then? You were in high school, right? - I think it was my third year. - She had that sailor-suit uniform. Oh, I remember! You looked really cute in that uniform, Sakuko. Our uniforms were so plain that they used to call use school-ghouls. Can you get the car? She really likes to boss guys about. You haven't met, right? This is my niece, Sakuko. - Hello. - Hello. This is Ukichi Kameda, an old friend of mine. - And Mizuho's ex-boyfriend. - Enough about that! She dumped me. She's my sister's daughter. - The other Mikie? - That's right. - Are you in high school? - No. She's retaking her university entrance exams. - Will you be able to study here? - Mum's always going on at me. I'll be able to concentrate here. - That's good, then. - I'll go and load the car. OK. I've made a note of the days when the rubbish gets collected. Don't forget to water the plants. - Where are you going again? - First, Amsterdam. Then around the Netherlands, Paris and the Loire. Are you going to see the castles? You've been there on research, right? - The Hague? - Yes, I'm going there. - I'll e-mail you. - Sure, sounds good. If there are any phone calls, just take a message for me. Is your work going OK, though? - Your pottery. - It's fine. - You seemed so busy before. - It's OK. I've got some time before my next exhibition. I'm coming. - You can use the bike outside. - Thanks. See you, Sakuko. You've been to the Netherlands, too? I went there on research. - For how long? - Two years. - How come? - How come what? I thought your field was Asia. India or something? - Indonesia. - Yeah, that's what I thought, that you just went to places in South East Asia. - Well, you know what a colony is? - Yeah. Indonesia used to be colonised by the Netherlands. - You didn't know that? - I majored in science. My major was in Area Studies. Area Studies. There are a lot of historical documents about Indonesia that you can only consult there locally. - Did you bring your swimsuit? - Yeah. There's a really beautiful beach over that way. - You know this area? - I used to live here. - At Mizuho's place? - No, but nearby. Wow! I love the sea! - It's hot! - The sand's pretty warm. - It feels great. - It's nice and smooth. Our parents got divorced. It was when I was in my second year of high school. My mum remarried straight away and we all went to Tokyo. We became part of a new family. They had a daughter. She was in between me and my sister in age. That was your mother. Did you know that already? - Yeah, more or less. - When did you find out? When I was in high school, I think, but I might have known already. That figures. Was it hard with your names? Your name is the same as my mum's. It was never really a problem. What about at school? We were in the same class once as we were both in the same year. The teacher just called us Ocean Mikie and Mountain Mikie. Why's that? My name is spelt with the character for 'ocean', and your mum's has the character for 'tree trunk'. My nickname stuck, but your mum's didn't. People sometimes write that on New Year cards to my mum. Really? Also, our names being the same meant we had to explain why a lot. That was a little hard. - Really? - Yeah. Did you have a nickname? - I don't really remember... - You've got a nice name. My friends don't know how to pronounce it. That means it's unique. I think I've been here before. I kind of remember it. We might have come here once with you and your mother. Just once? She didn't like the sound of the waves. Silly, right? - I like the sound. - I do, too. I can sort of remember the feeling of the ocean. - Oh, Sucko! - What? People called me Sucko when I was younger. Were they trying to bully you? Probably. Why? I think they were trying to be bullies, but it never really bothered me. They probably gave up on bullying you pretty soon. They'd say, "Hey, Sucko!" But I'd just answer them. Mikie! Oh, Tatsuko. - Hi. When did you get here? - Just today. - Are you staying here for a while? - A couple of weeks. I'll drop by next time. This is Tatsuko. - Hi. - Hi, I'm Sakuko. This is my niece, Sakuko. Tatsuko is Ukichi's daughter. - You already met him? - He was helping my sister. They get along really well. I work right over there. Drop by some time. - Sure. - I'll send you the address later. - She seems nice. - She doesn't look like Ukichi. Monday, 27 August - Are you applying to music college? - No... Shouldn't you be studying, then? Yeah, you're right. Tuesday, 28 August Hello. Hello. Is anyone at home? She's inside. - Hello. - Mikie, you're here! - It's been a while! - When did you get here? - Two days ago. - I had no idea. Is your sister here? She's on holiday. - But do come in. - Sorry for the intrusion. But it's incredible. - The Mona Lisa? - More than anything, the people. Like when you turn over a rock and there are barnacles all over it. - That's a bit graphic! - Sounds gross. It's like people hovering around a celebrity. - You can't see the painting. - Well, she is famous. There's another painting behind the Mona Lisa, but no one hangs about over there. It almost made me feel sad. When were you in Paris? - Five years ago. - With your husband? I went with a friend from my art class. I'm jealous of Mizuho, travelling alone like that. - You still draw, right? - Yes, every morning. She has exhibitions in a gallery in town. Those are for our group. - She had a show in Ginza. - I drew this one. - What kind of flower is it? - It's a Miqueliana. - This is a Miqueliana? - I really like them. I wondered what it looked like. Oh, really? Where did you see it in bloom? It's a little way from here, by the Seta River. - Can you tell me where? - You're that interested? I'm translating this. The flower was mentioned in the book. - English? - It's Indonesian. What's it about? The main character's brother comes back as a ghost. - Is it scary? - No, it's not scary. But the ghost always has this flower. I'd never seen one before. What does the ghost do with the flower? Can you guess? - No idea. - How about you, Sakuko? He eats it. - He eats it? - Yeah. I don't get it! It's a beautiful scene, though. He should eat something like mangoes or durian. It's Indonesia, so maybe salak. - What's that? - Salak. It's a fruit. How did he die? The ghost, I mean. Well... ...for that you have to go into Indonesian history. There were massacres after the 30 September Movement. He was a victim of one of them. The author of the book was actually a survivor. That's what it's about, but I've never seen the flower before. - It's a bit far, though. - How far? Maybe a 40 minute walk. That's not too bad. Want to come, Sakuko? Sure. - It's hot, isn't it? - Yeah. Hey, what's up? - We're heading for Seta River. - It's right over there. - We're going out near the hills. - That's over this way. This is my nephew, Takashi. Meet my friend, Mikie. - This is my niece, Sakuko. - Hi. - Come on, say hello. - Hello. Do you want a ride? - Weren't you heading somewhere? - It'll be a nice bike ride. Hey, hold on a second! What's up? Isn't this road a lot shorter? There are too many bends. It's way shorter. How many years have you been living here? - A bit over a year. - I've lived here for 46 years! You said this road was built two years ago! You like to debate just as much as your dad does. Why don't we try this road? You two can go by that one. We'll see which is faster. Sounds good, Sakuko? All right then. Just a second... Start your engines! Go! Have you finished your homework? For the summer holidays. - You're in high school, right? - Well... - You're done with it? - You could say that. You're a good student. I always leave it till the last minute. I don't go to school. I stopped showing up. Oh, OK. I had a friend who left school. - Was she anti-social? - No, she was friendly. Smart, too. She got 98% for a test, but she just stopped coming to school one day. Maybe she didn't see the point of it. There was probably some other reason. I'm not sure. My grades weren't good. - Then go to school. - I've had enough of it. - What do you do, then? - I have a part-time job. - Where? - A hotel. That sounds pretty cool. Not really. Actually... my uncle's the manager there. He got me the job. They're taking their time. They're late. - We're here! - You took your time! I tried to tell you. - When did you get here? - Way earlier than you two. Is it still there? Over here. There's a bunch down there. - Really? - There are bugs, too. Look at them. Wow, this is it! What a pretty flower. Aren't you going to eat it? The ghost did. True. It's bitter. - Want to try? - Isn't it bitter? Right? Take this! Let's go and travel beyond the hills Whistling all the way The sky is a splendid blue colour As through the fields we play We'll sing a cheerful song Hold hands and move along The duck goes "quack quack" The goat goes "baa baa"... Wednesday, 29 August Are you sleeping? Sleeping... I need to pop out. A friend of mine has showed up so I'm going to pick him up. Here we go. I'll be with you in a moment. Here you are. Is it good? - I haven't had shaved ice for ages. - Strawberry flavour? I like the sugar-flavoured ones. They're good, too. The colour is nice and cool. Yeah. I like Blue Hawaii flavour, too. It's really summery. Tasty. You know, the different syrups they use with shaved ice... ...actually all taste the same. - No way! - It's true. If you close your eyes, you can't tell the difference. Really? It's just a trick your mind plays on you. - An illusion... - Just a trick. Isn't work busy? There aren't many customers this season. I've got free time. There are those jellyfish on the beaches. And last year's tsunami. The ocean can be scary. It's better than last year, though. - See you. - Bye. We're holding a demonstration in the park against nuclear power. Demonstration against nuclear power. Please show your support. We're holding a demonstration. We'll be streaming it live on the Internet. Thank you. What was that about? I guess he's from around here, but I haven't seen him before. Have you worked here long? Since my first year at uni. Is it fun? Uni. It's pretty good fun. I write poetry. Poetry? - It's kind of weird modern poetry. - That's so cool! It's just for fun. I did publish a book this spring. You're a published author! It was self-published. Whatever the publisher, that's still great. I paid for the publishing myself. Like writing a fanzine. I think that's great. Really? Are you going to be in town for a while? I think so. Drop by again soon. I've got something to give you. - Oh? - A present. What is it? A surprise. You can look forward to it. I will. Thanks for the shaved ice. - Heading back? - Oh, Ukichi forgot this by the river. I don't live at home with him, though. I have a flat near the university. Where's his hotel? The hotel? It's not far from here. Why? I might as well return his hat. Are you sure? I can give it to him for you. I've got nothing better to do. Hello. Play this. Track 4 on repeat. OK. Do you know who that guy is? No. Remember him. He's a big shot. OK. That guy's a city councillor. And an old classmate of the owner of this hotel. Even if I'm not here, make sure you put that song on. - Got that? - All right. I guess he can't get it up. Without the song. I'm coming in. - Hey, welcome. - Hello. - Here. - Thanks. - You went to get it just for me? - I went back for this, too. - What's that? - My jacket. - You must be thirsty. - Thanks. So... Nothing. What? Is this what they call... a "love hotel"? No. Oh, I'm sorry. We pretend it's not. How did you know? - Tatsuko told me. - Ah, OK. - What did she say about it? - Nothing. - She doesn't like me. - That's not true. I've just accepted it. Why would you think that? Just a gut feeling. - A gut feeling. - Yeah, in my gut. - Sakuko's leaving. - OK. Go and see her out. All right. Bet you're surprised. - It seems like a really grown-up job. - It's not that great. I've never had a job. I haven't been doing it for long. I think studying's harder. But even though I studied, I didn't get in anywhere. It can really happen. I was kind of panicking after that. Panicking? When I didn't get into uni, I realised I was just empty. I knew almost nothing and didn't want to do anything. So if you'd got in somewhere, you wouldn't have been empty? I'm not sure. Maybe I would've been. Well, isn't it good that you found out? Maybe. I wish I'd gone on without realising it. I wasn't saying that I think you're empty! Oh, it's OK. I get worried not knowing what's in store for the future. Yeah, I feel the same way. Have you lived here long? It's still only been about a year. I remember you said. Where did you live before? - Well, up north. - North? That's right. - Huh? - Just some bad memories. Seriously? I'm never going back to my hometown. - What does that mean? - Ah, forget it. - Huh? - I'm just... kidding around. - Are you free tomorrow? - Yeah. We're going swimming. Want to come? Really? She's pretty, don't you think? Yeah. Yeah, she is. Mizuho is, too. - Your mum must be pretty, too. - Nope. She's not related. They're not related by blood. Oh, I get it. They happened to have the same name. They're both called Mikie. Oh, are they? My mum always got compared to pretty Mikie. Aunt Mikie started being extra nice to her and my mum became more self-conscious. I think it kind of had an effect on my mum. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Whenever they were together, they didn't really get along. What about you? What are your parents like? - Just average. - Meaning? They just had an average marriage, a kid, and carried on with their average lives. Do you get along well? Average. You seem close to your uncle. - You think so? - You seem to be. Ukichi used to date your aunt a long time ago. He dated Mizuho when they were in high school. - I thought it was Mikie. - I'd heard it was Aunt Mizuho. I heard it from my mum. He was dating someone who was studying stuff about South East Asia and they almost got married, but called it off. - Really? - I think so. I guess she couldn't have kids and that's where it went sour. - Are you sure? - Pretty sure. He knocked up his other girlfriend and they got married. - That doesn't sound like him. - You're right. Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. I didn't hear it from him, so just forget I said anything. No problem. Is it your first time here? - I used to come here quite a bit. - For work? I used to work at a university around here. Sakura University? - Kuriyama Women's University. - That's a good university, isn't it? The professor I met has asked me to come back to do another lecture. Oh, Kuriyama. My daughter's friend goes there. Do you know Keiko? She studies Economics. And the campus is really nice. - Ukichi's daughter goes there, too. - Who's that? A friend of mine. Come on in. Thanks. - Excuse me. - You mean Ukichi Kameda? You know him? - He drops by here once in a while. - Yes. Why does Mizuho even let him in here? That man's a thug. - That's a bit harsh. - But you know what he's like. - Welcome back. - Hello. - What have you been up to? - Just riding about. Hello. - This is Professor Nishida. - Hello. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. These are Toshie's friends. Excuse the intrusion. Sit down. You're acting like it's your house. - Were you by yourself all day? - I met up with Takashi. Takashi? - The one related to that hoodlum? - You know him? He's well-known around here. That boy is a refugee. - Refugee? - From Fukushima. - What about his family? - They're living in temporary housing. To escape the radiation? With Takashi still growing, everyone was worried. So Takashi moved here by himself. He lives with Ukichi now? That's right. Helping with his shady dealings. His parents must really be in a tight spot. - I'm going to go and lie down. - We'll be eating soon. Call me when the food's ready. - Excuse me. - See you later. Thursday, 30 August Excuse me. Aren't you... - ...Ikuo Nishida? - That's right. - I knew it! - You know me? - From the photo in your book. - Ah, thank you. You look a little different in person, though. They always use that old picture of me. I'm a friend of Mikie's. She told me you were in town. Tatsuko! - Why don't you sit down? - May I? Thanks. - What book was it? - It was about Western art. - I found it very interesting. - Thank you. But "interesting" sounds like rather cautious praise. It was interesting, but I wasn't clear about your own personal opinions. I wrote it as objectively as possible. Didn't you once say the objective never surpasses the subjective? I mean "objective" simply in technical, writing terms. My own subjectivity is embedded in certain initial choices, such as the subject and the data used. Aren't you going for a swim? I'm not really much of a swimmer. - See you at uni. - At Kuriyama? I'm a student there. You'll see me tomorrow, then. - I'll be looking forward to it. - Thanks. - How's the water? - It feels great. I'm going to go for a swim. I'll see you tomorrow. You know Tatsuko? She recognised me from a photo. - She's cute, isn't she? - She seems quite intelligent. - Your type? - Not exactly. - Takashi. - Hi. Make a tunnel. - A tunnel? - Can you make one? - Sorry about yesterday. - What for? Things must be tough for you. And there I was, talking your ear off. No, I'm doing OK. - Let me make it up to you. - Don't worry about it. I'll treat you to lunch. It's OK, really. - Are you busy? - I'm working. - All day? - Just in the morning. What time do you finish? At 1:00pm. Then I'll come and meet you. Skipping school for a date, huh? Lucky bastard! Better wear a rubber, or you'll get caesium on her! What was all that? My old classmates. Well, I only spent half a year with them. Jerks. Takashi. Sorry about that. They were just being stupid. - No big deal. - I gave them a good punch. - Really? - Yeah! How's it going? Just working. Is that your girlfriend? No. She came from Tokyo with a friend of my uncle's. We just met. Oh, OK. I wanted to talk to you before you left school. Give me your number. I'll send you my details. Sorry. - Is she your girlfriend? - Just a friend. I haven't seen her in a while. You're blushing. Just kidding. Friday, 31 August The reason that Mary Magdalene was dramatised is due to her role in occidental society. Having such prominence gave rise to her being dramatised. So let's examine what role she held in occidental... Nicely done. I appreciate you coming here. I was happy to be of help. - Your lectures really are something. - You think so? With you here, the students seem much more enthusiastic. - Oh, come on. - I mean it! Are you heading straight back to Tokyo? I need to go and see a friend first. - Well, I'll see you in Tokyo. - OK. - Let's have a drink together. - Take care. Professor! Well done. You're leaving already? - I need to stop by the library first. - It's over this way. I can show you. It seems different to how I remember it. Are you looking for a book? Ms Wakabayashi asked me to borrow a book for her. There's one that she needs. How did you like the lecture? It seemed more intense than your writing. - Are you in any clubs here? - The literature club. - What about it? - Oh, never mind. Shall I give you a ride? It's very hot. - You don't mind? - No. I can't turn that down. What brought you to Kuriyama University? - Professor Yamano invited me. - You didn't want to see Mikie? Well, that might have crossed my mind. It was good timing. - What's your wife doing now? - She's probably shopping. - Your children are very young, right? - Right. You wrote about one of them in an essay. Your youngest is 4 years old, right? You don't miss your family? - Now you're lecturing me. - I didn't mean to. Doesn't seem like any of your business. That hotel. - Which one? - Over there. - There. - That one? - My father works there. - Is that so? He's the manager there. - But it's just a front. - A what? It's more of a "love hotel" than a business hotel. I've heard about those. They've been on the news. - I guess love hotels make money. - Of course. Since the stays are so short. You could take Mikie there next time. - That's a little tasteless. - What's tasteful about an affair? - You're making fun of me. - I'm not. Your father should register the place as a love hotel. He says the laws on them are too strict. They can't be located near schools. Schools? - Kuriyama University. - Oh, right. You probably saw flyers on campus. "Get rid of phony hotels!" That's the one they're talking about. My dad used to be like a small-time crook. He never had a real job. He was barely ever at home. He racked up a load of debts, importing these cheap toys from China. He started off importing cat and dog toys. When I was in primary school, he came home one day. It was the first time in a while. He dumped ten big boxes in our house. In the middle of the night. Guess what was inside? What? Adult toys. - Wonderful. - Bad, right? He ended up losing money on that. My mum had to run all over the place asking for money. Then she died. He cried at her funeral. Just couldn't take it. After that he wanted to send me to a good university and he got the job at that hotel. He worked hard and got me into university, but now they're picking up on that hotel. It'll probably get reported to the police. It's almost funny. Isn't that a little cruel? Your father's working for your own good. It's all part of my plan. I'm trying to use up lots of his money. Scary. - You're out for revenge? - Exactly. - Do you and your father talk? - Sure, we do. We get along better than most. I can't stand to think of him as my father. I think of him as a source of money. You're quite funny. No, I'm not. Are you going anywhere? - Have you got something in mind? - Let's take a rest. - A "rest"? - Right. Just the two of us. I'll pay. I'll pay for it. Uncle. Uncle. My shift's over. - Take care. - See you later. I'm working the night shift tonight, - so go and eat somewhere. - OK. Hi. Hi. - Where should we go? - There's a café over there. Shall we? - It's hot today. - Yeah, it is. - It's summer. - It's summer all right. Let me know when you're ready to order. - What should I get]? - I've decided. - That was quick. - I knew what I wanted. - Get whatever you want. - You don't mind? It's my treat. - I'll get the mini-steak, then. - Mini-steak? You should get the duck! - Are you sure? - It's fine. - The roast duck steak, then. - OK. - Excuse me? - Yes. - Yes? - The roast duck steak for him. One roast duck steak... And the Japanese style spaghetti set for me. With tomato salad. - And rice? - And a side of rice. - Do you want anything to drink? - No thanks. That's everything. It won't be long. - You should answer it. - Sorry. Hello? This is Takashi. OK. What, now? I'm kind of busy. Where? Oh, really? Well... that's not what I meant. Sorry, I'll call you back. Was it that girl? - What did she say? - She asked me out. - Is she nearby? - She said she's at the station. You should invite her here. - Are you sure? - No problem! I guess I will, then. Hello? Do you know Café Winds? You turn at the intersection. That's the one. OK, see you. - She'll be here in like three minutes. - OK. - Hope it works out for you. - What? Takashi, it's all over your face. I'll be paying- - You are? That's fine. - Thanks. Have a nice day. Saturday, 1 September Cute. That's silly. Hello. Ukichi? Sure. Tonight? Sounds good. Where? OK. Should we head over around 6:00 then? 7:00? OK. There'll be Sakuko and one more person as well. Right. Thanks. See you then. What? Ukichi asked if we're free tonight. - Out of the blue? - It's his daughter's birthday today. You mean... You met her at the beach. You know, that pretty, intelligent girl. But what for? It's not much of a celebration. He doesn't really know how to celebrate. We should go. But I made a reservation at a restaurant tonight. I thought the two of us could spend some time together. - You can cancel it, right? - Of course I can, but... - If there's a fee, I'll pay for it. - That's not a problem. You don't want to go? It's fine if you don't want to. Tell us who you dated before my mum. Do I have to? You have a completely different personality than Mum had. - You think so? - Yeah, totally. You're attracted to people who are quite different to you. - What do you think? - You begin to resemble each other. - Really? - Are you and your wife similar? Maybe not that much. When we spend time together we start to become more similar. When we want to do certain things, or watch TV, or something. Well, we've got kids. You know when she feels like watching TV? You just know. But understanding isn't the same as having similar personalities. - By personality, you mean... - That's personality too, right? - It's not quite the same thing. - I don't know what it is. Well... You know, you seem... ...like a really sociable guy to me. - Where's Takashi today? - You know what he did? He forgot about Tatsuko's birthday - and went on some date. - He's got a girlfriend? I don't think she's his girlfriend. When I asked if he couldn't take a rain check, he looked all nervous. I just said, "Go on, then!" I wonder what the girl is like. - He's so shy, you know? - That's true. What kind of girls is he into? I think he said to me once that he likes girls who are outgoing. Is that so? Isn't that exactly how opposites attract? - Takashi's not like that at all. - True. It's kind of hard to say for sure. What kind of women do you like, Professor? - What kind of women? - I'd like to know, too. - I mean, which would you go for...? - Watch it! You know, if you had to choose. Just curious. You and your wife have grown similar, right? - Yes, of course we have. - And you're satisfied with that? What about you, Ukichi? - Me? - Someone you're after? - Me? - Well? Of course not! I can't meet anyone working there. You're stuttering. Lots of happy-looking people come to my hotel. They do what they do. "Do what they do"? So, how could I meet someone for myself? And you, Professor? Do you have a happy family life? - You're satisfied? - I'm very happy. So, you're satisfied. He says he's happy. You're satisfied, but you've got something on the side. Enough of that! Come on, now. I'm just getting a little drunk, that's all. Yeah? You're a professor. That must give you a lot of chances. That's not true. - You've never fallen for a student? - Absolutely not. I bet you have. I feel like you're hiding something. Do you think he's being honest with us? I am, honestly. No sense in denying it. Just tell us the number. I'm supposed to give you a number? How many students? - Not one! - Come on. If that was me, well! That's no surprise. - There'd be so many chances. - It might be different for you. Let's forget about it. Mikie, do you tend to go for intelligent men? In theory, but I always end up with terrible guys. Terrible guys? Intelligent guys can have bad personalities. I've got no eye for men. - Before, too? - It used to be worse. A lot worse. What was the name? Do you really want me to dredge this up? Hmm? What's wrong? Has he gone to the bathroom? Well, anyway... You two were pretty close. - We were closer than close. - Seriously? What's wrong? - What's with you? - Huh? That man won't stop making fun of me. - What's so funny? - Don't take him so seriously. - Just let it go. - It's irritating. Him, and that attitude of yours. What? I haven't been able... to spend any time alone with you. - We are alone. - No, we aren't. - That's why you're upset? - I came to see you. - Did I tell you to come? - Quit being so selfish, and listen to what I'm trying to say! You know that I'm here to work. I know, but so what? I've got work too. I told you I want to keep my work and love life separate. - I know. - I told you. But I don't understand you. I don't get it. - You've got enough time. - No, I don't! All I can think about is my translations. I just wish you'd come a bit later. - You wish I hadn't come. - I didn't say that. That thug, too! He's vulgar, and so's his daughter. Want you! On my shoulder... Why would you hang around with him? Don't talk about him like that. - A friend, huh? - What? - Sure he's not more than a friend? - Yes, he is. Don't be silly. We're friends. I want to know Strike a match and show me your face Life is a game Where you try Just to be loved... - I should get back to Tokyo. - Really? There aren't any buses or trains this late. I'll call a cab. Cut it out, Tatsuko! You horny dirtbag! - Go back to Tokyo! - Sorry, sorry about that. You idiot girl! - Welcome back. - Hey. - What are you up to? - Playing with fireworks. Are they still at it in there? The birthday party. I think it's over. - Are you going home? - No, I'm staying here. Ukichi said I could. There aren't many left. - Give me a lighter. - Here. Thanks. You're back late. I missed the last bus. - From your date? - It wasn't a date. Your uncle told us. - We just ate at a café. - Right, a date. She said she had something to talk to me about. We just talked. She wants to go out with you. You think so? Of course. - It didn't really seem like that. - How can you not see it? She's waiting for you. Next time, you've got to ask her out. Go to the beach, or something. She wants us to go to some event together. - Hey, that's great. - I guess that's a date? - That would be a date. - It would? It's OK, got it. Go after her. - OK. - I mean it. - Go for it. - OK. - You go after her. - I'll try! These won't light... Sunday, 2 September Hello? No to nuclear power! - I'm back. - Hi there. I'm going to take a little nap. Hello? I'll be there in five or ten minutes. It's in... Pay UP- How much? Is this all you've got? What, are you kidding? - You kidding me? - It's in the central park, right? Join our demonstration against nuclear power! Show your support! Please show your support! NO NUCLEAR REACTORS! CHANGE THE ENERGY POLICY! Please give us... Hello? I'm here. People say different things about the radiation, but I began to wonder if there was anything I could do. GOODBYE NUCLEAR POWER That's when I found this group. CHANGE THE ENERGY POLICY! The feeling that voicing my opinions here leads to actual results brought me a lot of satisfaction. I'll keep protesting against nuclear power until I can no longer shout. - Thanks for coming. - No problem. I didn't think so many people would come. Thanks for coming. I'm Ozaki. This is Takashi. I kept asking her to introduce us, but it took this long. Takashi stopped coming to school all of a sudden. You're probably surprised. We met through demonstrations. He's the organiser. I heard about all the hardship you went through in Fukushima. I hoped you'd come along today. She did tell you? I told you, right? Anyway, come with me. We'll be live streaming the event via USTREAM After the disaster at the Fukushima reactor, people have returned to their everyday lives and seem to have forgotten about it. But it's still not over. There are people who can't go home. This is Takashi who had to move here, away from his family. Takashi, come up. Um... The accident was so sudden, and with all the friends I have who can't go home, it's something I can't forget about. But to be honest, my dad worked at the power plant. So it was nuclear power that put food on our table. Somehow... ...I almost feel like we were asking for it. Really, I can't stand my parents. They both used to beat me up when I was a kid. I hated the town where we lived. I couldn't wait to get out of that dump. So when I came here alone, I felt great. I still do. Look, a lot of people want to go back there, and I think what happened is awful. But I'm not interested in going home. My parents ought to... ...just run away somewhere, too. I wasn't the right person to speak here. Sorry. In Fukushima now things are really bad. And as for my family... Why are you so early? No reason. Don't tell me, you got rejected? Yep. Just forget about it. I'll take you to a whorehouse sometime. Hello. Put that song on. Isn't that girl a high school student? Maybe. - And that's OK? - What is? That's just wrong. I know. But you're not doing anything? - Like what? - I don't know, anything. Takashi, you don't need... ...to come to work tomorrow. I'll get you another job. I'm fired? Let's just say... ...you've graduated. Have the police noticed? You can't have a high school student working in a love hotel. Something like that. It's time to move on. Sorry. Well, put in a good last day. Thanks. Hello, little baby Your smiling face Hello, little baby Your crying voice Your tiny hands And round little eyes Hello I'm your mother Hello, little baby Your life Hello, little baby For your future Your happiness Takashi, what the hell...? Hey, Takashi! Takashi? I pray you'll grow up Honest and strong Hello, little baby... - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - I'm not sure. Want to come with me? You mean run away together? - Run away? - Never mind. Sure. I'll tag along. There was a scene in a film like this. - With music like that? - What's that? That old American film with the kids. I don't know it. I was thinking of a really old Japanese film. A little girl and boy ran off together. Why did they run away? Just some reason. They were walking along the tracks. The girl says, "I want to run far away." I remember she looked so grown-up when she said that. What film was it? I'm not sure. My dad loved films. He'd just sit and watch them all day long on Sundays. Watching films must have taken his mind off things. You want to run away? Just like them. I don't know where to run away to, though. Hokkaido. Okinawa. Amami-Oshima. Ishigaki. What about... China? Hong Kong! Hong Kong. Russia. - Czech Republic. - UK. - America. - Norway. Sweden. Africa. Tunisia? - Bulgaria. - Machu Picchu. That's not a country. But... I guess our idea of "far" is probably different... ...than for someone like my aunt who travels all over the world. It's still the same. Really? Yeah. Oh. - What's wrong? - Takashi's not here, is he? - I haven't seen him. - OK. Sorry to barge in. - Is anything wrong? - No... Just I haven't seen him since he ran out of the hotel earlier today. - What about Sakuko? - She's not back yet. I heard he was walking around with a girl, so I thought it might be her. They're not kids anymore. They'll come home. I guess. - Did you try calling? - I can't reach him. - Can you call Sakuko? - Sure. - It's not connecting. - Hmm. Thanks anyway. Sorry to come by so late. I'll try and have a think where they might be. I'll come with you. Sakuko, call me if you get back I'd like to do research with people in some far-off country, like Aunt Mikie. - What kind of research? - I don't know. Maybe about the country's history or something. What for? There are already so many people in Japan who need help. Why go to some foreign country to help people? - Well... - That's a bit hypocritical. I feel sorry for what you've gone through. Stop it. I saw that rally on the Internet. You looked uncomfortable up there. I couldn't tell if you were laughing or crying, but I felt sorry for you. Sorry. Are you mad? No, it's OK. - Sorry. - I'm fine. Monday, 3 September Sorry, I was asleep. It's OK. - Have they come back? - Not yet. Let's wait until the morning and then figure out what to do. OK. It's been a while. - Since we've been alone. - You're right. Tatsuko's cute, isn't she? - Tatsuko. - Yeah. - She's a strange one, though. - Hmm. Why? Take good care of her. She's your daughter, after all. I know. You've got a daughter... I know. I'm going to get some rest. - You're going home? - Takashi might come back. Sure. We should go home. Yeah. What are you going to do? I'm going to go back, too. I should apologise to Ukichi. See you. I'm heading this way. Thanks for everything. You too. See you. Bye. - Welcome home. - I'm back. - What were you up to last night? - I stayed out. Alone? With Takashi. Ukichi was worried about you two. I think Takashi is home now. All right, but don't make us worry. What? - I finished my manuscript. - Really? That's great! It'll be done after a little editing. - You've worked hard on it. - Thanks. - I need to have a shower. - Go on, then. I'm all sweaty. It's so hot. When did you first go to Indonesia? I must have been in my early 20s. - Was it fun? - Very. Things there seemed so diverse and so full of energy. Life wasn't as comfortable as it is here, but I wanted to live there. Wow. Why did you want to do research in a foreign country? Why? The idea just came to me. I just wanted to go to a foreign country and I made a lot of friends there. If there's a tragedy happening where my friends are, I can't take my mind off it. It just naturally turned into my job. But aren't there people who need help here? Of course. And no matter how long you live in a foreign country, you're still just a foreigner to them. I suppose. You'll never be the same as a person from that country. So wouldn't someone from that country be able to do a better job researching? You might be right. Then what's the point of it? Well, let me ask you. Do you know yourself better than anyone else does? I'm not sure. Aren't there things you don't know about yourself? Some things are clearer when viewed by other people. Did you know that when you laugh, you flare your nostrils? - No way. - It's true. Countries are just the same. - I'm just kidding! - Quit looking at my nose! - Are you dating Ukichi? - Why do you ask? Remember when we biked to the river last week? I rode down the path you took, but it was shorter. A lot shorter. Why did you take so long? Now that you mention it... It's a secret. Top secret. Tuesday, 4 September Hello? Oh, hi! I'm doing fine. Yeah. I know. It's really hot here. It's nice and cool at night, though. I've got sunburn. Mikie's fine. I'm studying. No, I mean it. Really? Yeah. It came already? Oh? OK. From when? When are you going? Day after tomorrow. - To prepare for retakes? - Yeah. Do you want to go? I should get my act together. Good for you. Did you figure out what you want to do? - More or less. - What's that? A secret. It's a secret? Top secret. - Thanks again for everything. - Come back again soon. Here's the present I wanted to give you. The kids here must be you, me and Takashi. - Really? - Looks like it. I found it when we were going through my mum's stuff. When I saw you last week, it finally came to me. - Are you sure I can keep it? - Of course. Thank you. Is your mother in the picture? She was always behind the camera.
