They say if you were born at Grady, Crawford Long, Georgia Baptist, you know what I'm saying? - Okay. - That's really Atlanta hospitals. When you leave the hospital, your house gotta be in Atlanta too. I'mma tell you the easiest way. Everything inside of 285… Is Atlanta. - Most of it. - Supposed to be. Most of it. Look at all them niggas from outside 285. Fuck y'all pussy-ass niggas! I put my work in. Nah, this College Park. This shit different. - What's different? - See, like, in Atlanta… - They break into your car. Mm-hm. - Right. In College Park, they take shit off your car. They taking all kinds of shit down here. I seen a nigga snatch a nigga food at the food court. They not playing. Jesus, you mean to tell me you break in a car in Atlanta, but in College Park, they gonna steal your catalytic converter off your shit? No, in College Park, they do shit like they'll take the whole tire off, and steal your baby seat. Damn! These niggas down here do shit like bust your window and lock your door. Know what type of nigga you got to be to steal baby clothes? "Hey, bro, I got couple of 2Ts and 3Ts if you need them." Somebody need them. Shit real. My homeboy, they busted his window out. - No! - Stole the baby seat. He put some plastic up. I guess it was the same niggas. They came out and bust his plastic out. He must've did something.

Looks like a cold-ass graduation in this motherfucker. Shit look lit! Look at all these niggas. Who got some weed? Fuck that bullshit. What's happening? Where my focus at? I'm through smoking weed. That shit done got too strong. Why you say that? Why you say the weed got too strong, Karlous? That shit done got too strong, bro. I know they put that fen-phen in it. 'Cause I was high the other day, fucked around and ordered a pregnancy pillow, nigga. - The one that you lay between the legs? - Nigga… That ain't really a bad idea. I'm at home taking naps like I'm ten months. And I done got used to it. I done laid my nuts off the side. That shit's good though. I can deal with the weed. I just can't fuck with the edibles. I can't do the edibles. I'mma tell the story. Karlous gave me an edible one time, shit made me start smoking regular weed for three years. I went in the bathroom, looked in the mirror, my eyelashes flew off my face. Nigga, I was like, "Nigga, I'm trippin'!" Fuck that. I ain't fucking with no edibles. I used to pop pills, nigga. I'm really from the trenches. Martin Luther King. Stop playing with me. Hamilton E Holmes, boy, was my train station. Martin Luther King would not approve of you popping no goddamn pills, nigga. Just saying, it's a long-ass ride when you come from Five Points. That's an hour and a half. You gotta be on something. See, you didn't even catch that. See, only a nigga from Atlanta, when he tell you five different things that ain't got shit to do with he talking about, that mean he serious as fuck about what he about to say.

Real nigga shit. No cap. Ain't nobody's threw me no weed, bruh. Goddamn. I said, "Let me get a three-five!" These white folks ain't gonna do nothing to you. They scared. They're like, "Oh no, I don't wanna get locked up." Just throw it, ain't nobody gonna see who threw it. Just throw it far. I go to see, and I'm like, "There goes my weed." Niggas smarter than that. They ain't bringing no weed in here. Soon as they saw the goddamn Convention Center, they were like, "Hell, no, boy, them Fed charges." Well, we're in Atlanta, boy, somebody's got an ounce in their nuts right now. Just going through the aisle, "You straight, my boy?" This nigga said you got a whole ounce in your nuts.

He was watching you. For real? This is how my city gonna do? Ain't nobody gonna throw a nigga no weed? I went to Minnesota, I said, "Throw me some weed." Them niggas was like… They threw it. Why y'all looking like an Easter egg hunt? "Where the weed, y'all?" - Not no pre-rolled. That shit... - Hell nah. I'm from the city. You got me fucked up. That shit got a Percocet 30 in it. Hell nah. Stop. Turn the music off. Stop. - Yeah. - See? This is what I'm mad at. And you can tell they just rolled that blunt 'cause it is still wet. Ugh! Don't nobody want that shit.
