Who's there? No. Don't come near! No, no, no! Stop it.

Good morning, master. SERIAL RAPIST CRIME RAPE MACHINE REVEALED!! I am reporting from the scene of the crime. A rape incident has occurred in this quiet neighborhood. It is the third time this month, but a suspect has not been apprehended. I said, "suspect", but it may not be human. A witness says the suspect is not human... It seems like a scary crime is going on. Yes, master. ...the police advise caution in this area... We've been alone for a very long time. Not... ...that I'm dissatisfied. I quit my job and live the retired life. And, I have some money saved. I guess this is the easy comfortable life. But, you know... ...it'd be more fun if you could move. I'm sorry, master. Don't apologize. It's not your fault that the batteries went dead. But, you know what, Maria? You and I are... ...a heartbreak. Maria, do you remember the first time you came to this house? How many years ago was... ...not years. That was decades ago, wasn't it? Welcome home, young master. I will look after young master from today. I'm T-207... ...Maria. No. What's this? I can't free myself! Ow! I was still in elementary school and my parents worked far away... ...so they brought you to take care of me. My parents worked at the manufacturer so they were also product testing. I don't believe it. What am I to do? It doesn't taste good? Young master, you haven't even taken a bite. I mixed up the salt and sugar. I'll replace it right away! Why am I bad at everything I do? It wasn't all your fault that you were clumsy. Now that I think about it... ...clumsiness was part of... ...the standard T-207 Maid Droid program. I, Maria, want to become a maid that can do the job. You are fine as you are. Do you mean that? Even I can be of service? Does young master need Maria? Thank you. I'm happy. May I ask for one more thing? From today, may I refer to young master as, "master"? Thank you, master! You are fine as you are. Later, I read the manual and realized that was your password. Maid Droids recognize its master with the password... ...becomes customized... ...and becomes the master's exclusive maid. I cook by myself, eat by myself, and clean up by myself. How boring. Wait a bit. After I clean up I'll read for you. What? A bedtime story? Leave it to me, master. That's Maria's specialty. In my A.I. Is stored three hundred of the world's great novels. And you can append to it! I can act out one hundred twenty seven different parts in high quality audio. So "The Brothers Karamazov" is no problem! Huh? That's too serious and you can't sleep so something else? Then what would you like? Shakespeare? Or how about... I'Isle-Adam? What? Pinocchio again? PINOCCHIO Old man Geppetto found a talking log... ...and made a doll out of the log. The doll, named Pinocchio... ...asked of the Blue Fairy... ..."please make me a person". "If you are brave, honest, and generous, I will grant your wish"... ...the Blue Fairy promised. Pinocchio tried very hard to be good so that he can become a person... ...but it was very difficult. Bad friends tempted Pinocchio... ...and so Pinocchio pulled pranks, told lies, and did bad things. She's in a bad mood. I heard she put down her dog. Her dog? You mean Aibo, the Bot-dog? It's Aibu. A.I.B. U... Aibu. - Yes. - This June's revised regulations... ...completely prohibits ownership of any current machines. Commissioner Akagi was an user? You're slacking off on the investigation! Just how many manufacturers can make criminal robots? Yes. I visited the various companies, but they all deny that their robots can be criminal. Or course, they would say that. Do you know Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics? Was it that robots may not injure humans? Will not injure humans. Will obey human commands. Will protect itself. These rules restrict robot behavior. All the manufacturers say... ...it is programmed into the Artificial Intelligence of all androids. And that keeps them from crime? What if they're ordered to harm a human? Well... The First Law has priority so it cannot obey such orders. It seems they stop functioning in such situations. But these crimes are actually occurring, so one of the manufacturers is lying. What does CSI say? There were machine parts at the scene... ...but we can't tell who manufactured them. You mean they're not genuine parts? A modified unit or possibly a completely homemade robot. Who is this idiot otaku? To create a rape machine. The manifestation of a resentful man to whom real women don't pay attention. I'm sorry, master. In truth, I'm the one that's supposed to bathe you. It's all right. You've bathed me for years and decades. Returning the favor isn't going to do any harm. Hello? Ueno residence. Yes. Yes. A car accident? When my parents both died, I was still a student. I inherited this house and enough money for college. I turned down relatives who said they'd take me in. I preferred to be with Maria than to live with strangers. This is sad. This is too sad. I'm sure my parents are happy that someone cares so much about them. More than your parents, it's you, master. Master, you're all alone. I'm sorry for you. Thank you, but I'm not alone. Master? Because aren't you with me? To be told such thing... ...makes Maria very happy. I can say this now, but our life together was tough. After all, I was going through puberty. Master? It's wrong to be lewd. It's still too early for master. It was then that... ...the Sex Technology Option for the Maid Droid T-207... ...became available on the market. I resolved to make it the first thing I'll buy when I grew up and get a job. But, it didn't go that smoothly. This is a message. The product you ordered... ...the Sex Technology Option... ...Stick It In Great... ...Model Number L-101089... ...cannot by incorporated as an option... ...as this unit is a prototype. Awaiting further orders. I am remorseful for not being able to fulfill your desire. Master, what is that? I bought this ring to give to you. No. That is too good for Maria. I am just a maid. - Master? - Huh? I think master should have a human wife. Yeah. Maybe I'll visit a bride matching service. What a dirty house. But the plot is pretty large. Was it eighteen hundred square feet? Yes. How much is eighteen hundred square feet worth in the city? Fifty million yen? Eighty million? Maybe one hundred million? Wow! Come on. Use your hips. I know you're a virgin, but can't be a dead lay. Um. I've had enough. What? You went limp? I haven't come yet. We were just getting started. I'm sorry. Hey, you! Yes, right away! I'm thirsty. Will tea suffice? This is great. I've never seen a Maid Droid before. So there really are sorry guys who get off on Maid Droids. But you're all right from now on. You have me now. Isn't that great? Happy now? You're not happy? I'll get the tea. Hey! What's that? Oh, it's cheap. Here. What? Hurry up with the tea. You're done here. At least make sure the tea is good. Yes. Ouch. What are you doing? Please don't treat Maria like that. Huh? I don't get it. I pop your cherry and am even willing to marry you. And you hit me? You don't have to marry me. Please leave. Breaking off an engagement? You fuck and dump me? That won't fly. I expect big consolation money, you creep! Get off on a machine for the rest of your life! Move! Master! Shouldn't you go after her? Isn't she going to be your wife? It's all right! No it's not! I'm a maid. You can say anything to me and I won't be hurt. I can withstand anything for my master's happiness! I've had enough! Master, a Maid Droid doesn't cry. - Master. - Maria. - Yes? - Yes? Well, you first. Yes. I connected online to the company product management computer. Then I found there is a way to install the Sex Technology Option. Really? Yes, master. Please buy the same model Maid Droid as Maria. Then there will be no problems with the Sex Technology Option. But that wouldn't be you! That's meaningless. Maria, are you serious? Sex isn't all I want. Master, please listen. That's no different from that stupid woman! Sex, money, sex! But master, if you take my memory... I apologize for that woman. I'm sorry for bringing that bitch home. My heart momentarily wandered. I truly regret it. If I'd known, I should have stayed a virgin! But, master, please listen. If you copy my memory and install it in the new machine... I don't... ...then it will possess the same memory as Maria! ...ever want to have sex! Then it will be the same as Maria to my master! Then... ...then what happens to this Maria? If we install your memory into a new machine with the Sex Technology Option... ...and that machine becomes the new Maria... ...what happens to you, the Maria that is here right now? I don't know. Do I throw you in the trash like an old electronic gadget? Do you think I can do such a thing? Master, you scare me. Maria is scared of loud voices. I'm sorry. Master? May I continue to wash your back? Yeah. Yes. Wait. I'll wash that myself. Master, will you allow Maria to service you? I want to serve you in any little way. I can't have sex, but it's the least I can do. Please allow me. Is that wrong? Maria. Master, does it feel good? Yeah, it feels real good. Master, I'm happy. I was happy. After my body was made dirty by the gold digging fleshy ugly woman... ...I felt I was purified. I'm going to come. It's going to come. Master, please come. I will take it in my mouth. Maria. Master. It was the right decision to never get married. Thanks to you, I was able to have a fulfilling life with you. To be frank, that's so gross. Doll loving people? Really. It's unbelievable. You have sex with full size dolls? That's so creepy. Amateur virgin, better yet, virgin with humans? Isn't it masturbation? Doesn't that make him a real virgin? You can't call it sex if it's a machine. I think... ...the notion that men who have sex with many women... ...is considered the winner is strange in the first place. Being a lifelong virgin... ...and knowing love is a valid life. Oh the one hand we have delinquency, late marriage, and no marriages. And sexlessness is also a social problem. And this adult man is playing with dolls. What are you thinking about? I've always wanted ask for an explanation. What is the thinking of people who are satisfied with dolls? Asking me about responsibility is putting me on the spot. Is delinquency and sexlessness our fault? It is the responsibility of doll lovers. You're masturbating to sex dolls of maids, right? Try focusing that effort on a real flesh and blood woman. Then... ...our delinquency and sexlessness problems are over. Basically... ...women with big eyes like this and little waists like this... ...don't exist. Doll lovers are delusional so they tend towards crime. I bet that serial rapist is the work of a reclusive man in the shadows pulling the strings. Even Bot-dog... ...ownership is now restricted so Maid Droids should also be the target of regulation. You otaku should look to reality. You know, reality! I do look to reality. Where? You're so amusing. We Maid Droid users... ...are not into it just for the purpose of sex. We cherish the communication of the heart. We seek a certain solace. Communication of the heart? Dolls have hearts? Even if it did, it is Artificial Intelligence. See? A fabrication. It's fiction. You don't see reality. Well, the perfect female image... Here it comes, "the perfect female image". Female adoration and female derision are two sides of the same coin. Deep inside, you are... ...deriding women. Lolita complexes and mother complexes are all rooted in the same place. Can you refute that? How about it? Shut up! I once had unrequited love for a real woman. But they all dump me. Women aren't attracted to me. I'm ugly and creepy. Even when it's passive unrequited love, I get accused of stalking. My heart has been completely shredded. That's my reality! Is it wrong to seek solace in a delusion? You over thirty bitches with rotted amniotic fluids... ...have rotten fetuses! You're trash that never blossomed. You're the ones who need to see reality. You want good looking rich guys to swoon over you... ...and fuck your brains out? You're trash that never blossomed! You're the ones who need to see reality! You want good looking rich guys to swoon over you and fuck your brains out? That's not possible, you morons. Good looking rich guys... ...are few and far between... I'm thinking of going to Akiba tomorrow. ...they already have their wives, lovers, and sex partners. You'd just be sex objects. Are you thinking, "again?". And you're fourth in line. Do you see that reality? Your amniotic fluids have rotted because all you do is watch TV and not reality. You're both ugly loser bitches. Good looking rich guys don't come on to you. Don't attack harmless otaku in retaliation for that! Delinquency, the end of marriage, and sexlessness... ...is the result of the high ambitions of you ugly bitches! Realize that. Take a look at reality! PLEASE STAND BY By Akiba, do you mean Akihabara? If the Rape Machine is a homemade android... ...where do you think the suspect would obtain parts and technical information? That would be Akiba. Not only that. We got an appointment with Mr. X. Mr. X? Yes. What, a replacement battery for a T-207? What, a replacement battery for a T-207? That's the difficult request of an enthusiast. Everyone in the industry knows the prototype Maid Droid is Japan's pride around the world. But it's been sixty years since its introduction. The manufacturer isn't supporting it anymore. Nobody has replacement parts for sixty year old electronics. There are no genuine batteries. And the old format isn't compatible with new batteries. I saw a T-207 go for one billion million yen on a treasure hunt TV show. That's one billion. The battery alone would be one hundred million. You should just give up. But the fact you're looking for a battery means you have the main body. You're kidding. What? A factory prototype is so rare. Will you sell it? Shit, I don't have one billion. How about a trade for ten of our T-3356? They are replicas of the T-207. The face and the voice are practically the same. Just between us, they've been illegally upgraded. The Sex Option is awesome. I'm serious. As easy as they come. Mr. Customer, are you leaving? Hey! What an unfriendly old man. I just overheard you. You have a modified T-3356? - We have them. - What? - Of course, we have them. - What? You're into Eve T-3356. Want to try a test ride? Yeah, yeah. Don't be rough, master. Treat me nice. I like her reaction. See? How is it to the touch? We made it twenty percent softer than the original model. It's nice. Big and small tits are interchangeable. Ease in changing attachments. The user can change them at home at their leisure. I get tired of big tits. Try sucking the nipples. See how they get harder? This modification wasn't easy. Is this memory based silicon? It feels good, master. Eve is so sensitive. How do you feel about Eve's sensitivity? This is the STANDARD MODE. Can you raise the sensitivity? TEN GEARS FROM FRIGID, UNDEVELOPED, VIRGIN... ...HYPERSENSITIVE MODES... ...are available. See? Eve's going to climax! That's too high! Set it to normal, please. Here. Good. This is just right. Now, let's check her down there. Well? Isn't it a beautiful pussy? How is it different from the original model? I'm glad you asked. In the standard version... THE LIPS ARE SYMMETRICAL... But that's not realistic. Take a good look. Isn't the left lip ever so slightly bigger? You're obsessed. We modified the clitoris to be a little bigger. CLITORIS INCREASED TEN PERCENT... ...in volume. Yes, this is true. Master, Eve is very shy. Go ahead. Touch it for her. Let me try. She's already wet. How is her love juice? SYRUPY AND WATERY EQUIPPED WITH TWO... ...types of wetness. I like the syrupy gusher. Isn't everyone like that? Not at all. Some people like it dry and abrasive. They like the way it feels forced. It takes all kinds. Yes. I like her expression. Maid Droids respond to all of the user's desires. Want to see her squirt? Wow, awesome! This is included? CLEAR TYPE AND YELLOW PEE TYPE EQUIPPED WITH TWO TYPES OF SQUIRT And what about the ass? The ass. I like anal. Of course, anal fucking is all right. Seriously? ANAL FUNCTIONAL But the anal function is illegal. It's an incomprehensible law that says it promotes sex crimes. But, Eve can do it. That's what modifications are about. Ouch. Master, it hurts. She says it hurts. The customer has to buy Eve and spend a long time "programming" it. LEARNING FUNCTION LEARNING FUNCTION PREPROGRAMMED I see. You got it down. Well, for today, I'll put it the pussy like normal. Awesome. Master's thing is inside. How is the tightness? VIRGIN SIZE POST NATAL SIZE FIVE GRADATIONS OF CAVITY TIGHTNESS... ...can be adjusted. I'd like it a little narrower. And I'd like her a littler more sensitive when I put it in her. Because my thing is small. A littler narrower, a little more sensitive. Oh, yeah, master. Yeah, the tightness and sensitiveness is good. The fit feels perfect for my size. Sorry to interrupt the fun, but this is the price. You accept installments, right? In the case of installments... ...this is the initial payment plus fifty payments. But it's still expensive. Not at all. It's a lot cheaper when you think of marrying a greedy real woman for life. That's true. And real women can betray you. But Maid Droids are worry free. They don't cheat and will never dump you for another man. They love one man for life. The love of a Maid Droid is eternal. Let's stop fixating over real flesh. After all, a lover affair is just a selfish... ...IMAGE... ...IMAGINARY LOVE AFFAIR... ...forced upon both men and women. Men are especially a sucker for... ...IMAGE Women know that so they make up and dress up and men fall for this... ...IMAGE But, you know, both cosmetics and fashion are... INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS Even if we don't fall for extreme cosmetic surgery... ...we men desire the... ...INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS... ...that give a... ...FICTIONAL IMAGE... ...that raises our sexual desire. Fine. Then let's go for... ONLY THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCT Let's have a happy love affair with a Maid Droid! Now I'll tell you about the very special feature. Huh? There's more? The vaginal wall that wraps around and clings to the penis! Let's do the legendary One Thousand Worms! For real? ONE THOUSAND WORMS MODE I can't take it anymore! Does it feel good? It's too good. I'm going to come right away. Master, I'm so happy. Please enjoy it more and come many more times. And now, the Herring Roe Ceiling! ONE THOUSAND WORMS MODE HERRING ROE CEILING MODE Maximum power! MAXIMUM POWER HERRING ROE CEILING MODE This is seriously dangerous. It hurts, it hurts! Please feel good. More. No, it hurts. Stop it. Stop, stop it! MAXIMUM POWER HERRING ROE MODE I'm sorry, sir. It seems to be broken. Don't tell me, "it seems broken"! It's going to tear! It's going to tear off! I am so happy, master. Don't worry about that. It's just a delusion by a modified Maid Droid. A malfunction or perhaps just a breakdown. The guys here do extreme modifications. It's a problem. Do you mean illegal modifications? I have to arrest them. Didn't you come regarding another crime? Well, yes, that's true. The Serial Rape Machine. It is a sad incident. Wait a second. Let me ask some questions. I am with the Police Investigative Unit. Commissioner Yuri Akagi. I heard about this place from a detective in this jurisdiction. Are you Mr. X? Some people call me that. What is this doll? A transmitter? I'd like to talk to you face to face. That's not possible. I've lost my body a long time ago. You're Artificial Intelligence? I was originally human. But I died. Before I died, I copied my mind. My will, memory, and feelings... ...and what is called my spirit, is all built in. This doll is my computer terminal. Please forgive my bad taste. This way I thought I could communicate more humanely than with monitors. I don't know about a machine doll that talks about humanism. Well, whatever. I have questions. Who is the suspect that is controlling the Rape Machine? There is no human suspect. You mean it is not a lethal machine doll controlled by a person? So it is an independent Artificial Intelligence. But what about Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics? That is why I say it is a sad incident. What do you mean? Do you know about Host Droids? The male version of Maid Droids? Yes, but all the manufacturers are pulling out of this genre. The reason is simple. They don't sell. Because women are realistic. We don't escape into stupid fantasy as men do. That's not right. It's just that men and women have different fantasies. Women do not seek submissiveness, kindness, or faithfulness in men Women want men to play around with them and to be violent to them. That's stupid! Isn't your boyfriend that type? He lies all the time, screws around, and gets violent right away when he's angry. My first boyfriend was like that and that's why I left him. No. Your excuse for leaving him is just an excuse after the fact. When you got cool about it, you just took some of his natural dispositions and made it his fault. Proof of that is that your next lover was probably the same type. I like kind men. That's easy to say. If you look at the all the attractive men out there, they're all like that. LIES UNFAITHFUL VIOLENCE But the sex is good so you can't leave. Ten percent of the men dominate one hundred percent of the women. That's the contemporary... ...LOVER'S HIDDEN SOCIETY A balance is maintained by providing the ninety percent of loser men with Maid Droids. Conversely, Host Droids, regardless of sexual ability... ...cannot be violent and unfaithful like real attractive men... ...because of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. An obedient and faithful Host is... ...like an honest swindler and isn't going to be accepted. Did you have a good time? I understand the reason Host Droids don't sell. But what has that got to do with these crimes? Relax. Did you know that Bot-dogs were developed and marketed in place of Host Droids? Don't tell me you were an user? Well that makes things easy. It's... Aibu. The language function was eliminated and it was scaled down for low cost. It was cheap and had modest sales. Women who were tired of being used by attractive men bought them for solace. But women really want hot men who are liars, unfaithful, and violent. So, unlike loser men who treat Maid Droids with care... ...they were treated exactly like dogs. Stray Aibu Bot-dogs had become a social problem. Cheap things are easy to throw away. Wild Aibu have been stealing electricity from vending machines and street lights. It's just a small amount to maintain power. A big deal was made that they stole... ...electricity for trains. Eventually a change in the law that banned all ownership. A manufacturer recall of all machines. In addition, a big hunt for stray Aibu was conducted. The poor Aibu that were thrown away were all disposed of as scrap metal. I didn't want to throw mine away. By scrap, you don't mean... Didn't the Rape Machine first appear near a solid waste disposal facility? The Rape Machine is an aggregation of discarded Aibu? Some Artificial Intelligence must have survived. It probably assembled the various discarded parts. Call it the ghost of Aibu... ...or the Artificial Intelligence self preservation function. Aibu is seeking revenge upon us? Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics still lives. Besides giving women orgasms, they shouldn't be causing any real harm. In initializing itself during the repair process, Aibu stopped recognizing its owner. So it uses its proprietary sensor to find horny women and arbitrarily services them. Don't you think it is a sad incident? How can I stop the Rape Machine from functioning? So, that's where you go? It's my job. Just make it recognize its master. Somebody has to become its master. It has to be custom programmed again. And if the master wishes it to cease functioning... Aibu will probably obey. How does it recognize its master? First you have to be horny. The rest is a simple password. Will you be able to figure it out? Password. Aibu and Maid Droids will continue to love their masters. Aibu and Maid Droids will continue to love their masters. They continue to love even when they are treated badly. They love and love and love in eternal unrequited love. Anyone who feels it as a burden has no business seeking love in the first place. People like that are... ...LIMITED TERM LOVE AFFAIR GAME... ...players fooling around. Real people can run around switching partners left and right. People who don't know real love and just have... LOVE GAME MENTALITY DEVOTION OF MACHINES Do they have the right to quash the devotion of machines? INTERNET AUCTION YOU WON THE AUCTION I finally found it. I won the bid for your replacement battery on the internet auction. One hundred million was a little expensive. I barely got by with all my savings and by selling this house and property. We're out on the streets from tomorrow, but we'll manage somehow. Better yet, we'll be able to talk again. That is far more important. By tomorrow morning, it'll be here by express delivery. The wish will be granted. Wish? What is this about? Kiss three times and chant the spell three times. Your lover will be reborn as a human. Spell? What is this spell? Who are you? You will find the spell in your heart. I am the Blue Fairy. Blue Fairy? PINOCCHIO Aibu, lick it. It feels good. Come, put it in. Hurry. It feels good. You're trying so hard to make it good for me. I'm happy. You're wagging your tail for me. You want to be mine? Or are parts of my Aibu in you? But I'm sorry. I have to stop you from functioning. I'm a horrible master for making you die twice. Aibu, are you all right with that? CEASE FUNCTION COMMAND DENIAL STAND BY What do I say? We talked a lot for decades. Even after your battery died you still spoke to me a lot. But at a time like this, I don't know what to say. I don't know the words for the spell. You and I are... ...a heartbreak. I'm sorry, Aibu. I'm sorry I'm a bad master. It felt really good. Thank you for always loving me so much. You're kind. You're good. - HOLD - Aibu, I also... Maria, I... ...Iove you. ...Iove you. I love you. I love you. I love you! I love you! I LOVE YOU HOLD CEASE FUNCTION COMMAND OBEY Maria. Master, are you going to make Maria your bride? If that is all right with you. Of course. Maria is very happy. Is anybody home? Mr. Ueno? It's express delivery. Anybody home? Mr. Ueno, express delivery. I love you, master. ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BOBBY WHITE
