Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** Of course we suffered losses, man. You don't go up against a force like this without expecting losses. [Speaking Spanish] How many losses? How many losses? Seven men and women killed. A dozen wounded. [Speaking Spanish] You're wounded, too. You're wounded, too! These wounds are nothing, see, compared to the wounds that they've inflicted on our country. But we're gonna fight them till we win. You got that? We're gonna fight till El Salvador is free, there ain't nothing gonna stop us. Hey, you got that? Yeah. I got it. Man, this don't look good. Are you kidding? It's great. Come on. Come on. Come on! You'll get me killed this time, Donovan. You'll get another Emmy. A bullet in my earphone. Look at him! Look at him. Unbelievable. Unbelievable is that we're still here. Now come on, man! Get in already. Hurry up! Wish we had a Tyler mount. I wish we had a tank. Hang in there. It's no worse than Cambodia. At least if you got creamed there, I could've passed for one of them. Where'd he go? Mike. Ah! Tony, you ok? Loving every minute of it. I knew I should have gone to law school. Can you run? Do I have a choice? - Not really. - Let's go. I'll draw their fire. You haul it over there. Mike, you're crazy. We're going out together. Get your can in gear. Go! Mike! Come on, Algernon. Show Dr. Metz your tummy. It's remarkable! The lesion's nearly healed. Yes. You know how long my research staff have been searching for that formula? Well, Ruth helped a lot. Not so. She did it all herself. I was very lucky. Hmm. The truth is, Juliet, that you are very, very gifted. I warn you, Ruth and I are gonna try to steal you from the med school, get you into biochemistry full-time. Have you heard about them? They're everywhere. They're all around the world. But wherever the reports have come from, Paris, Rome, Geneva, Buenos Aires, Tokyo, descriptions of the craft are all identical. And now I'm told that our affiliate station kxt in San Francisco now has a picture. Yes, there it is. Good lord. It's coming in across the golden gate. This is a live picture from San Francisco. Gently, Robert. She's a very special lady. Upper pleistocene. It's much older than we've found before now, Quinton. Aye, that she is, lad. Notice the contour of her forehead. You see how it... Richard, what is that? It's huge! What the devil... It must be 3 miles across! This is the scene along the champs elysées we repeat, this picture's coming live from Paris where another giant ufo is moving overhead. The Pentagon reports that fighters from the tactical air command bases around the nation have approached the monstrous ufos, but all the jets reported interference with their on-board guidance and electrical equipment, making it quite impossible to get within a mile. Missiles fired simply go astray and detonate out of range. Here, one of the craft approaches Washington, D.C. Police and troops are trying to maintain orderly evacuation of the nation's capital and all other cities which are threatened by this unknown menace. Roads and highways everywhere are jammed with traffic. Other craft are known to be approaching at least six other major U.S. cities... San Francisco, Houston, new York city, and New Orleans, the Chicago area, and Los Angeles. - Get the car started! - Mama! Granddad! Granddad, come on! Granddad! Polly! Polly, are you hurt? I didn't hit her. She was coming right at me! I didn't hit her. Get out of here! Come on! - There it is! - Oh, there! It's gonna be alright, we gotta move! Mom? I ran out of my house. I thought it was an earthquake. No, it is not an earthquake, Ruby. Dear , what is it? I can't believe it! - What is it? - It's fantastic. Come on. Don't just stand around. Let's go! And tass confirms reports that similar gigantic craft are now approaching Moscow, Leningrad, and vladivostok. This would bring the unofficial count to at least 31. How can it just hang there? Cairo also is reporting that its ufo is stationary now like almost all the others. I still think we should leave the city. No. The roads are jammed. - Oh, Stanley. - You heard the president. So far there's no indication that they're hostile. But if they are... If they are, I'm not sure where we would find a hiding place. Of what this unbelievable event will mean to us. Look, it's London! In London, parliament is waiting like us for first sign of contact. The Soviet union is broadcasting throughout Russia... - Daddy! - Mom, dad's home! - Are you okay? Is everybody okay? - Yeah. It's so neat. It's scary, too, but... Oh, Robert. I know, I know. Me, too. At least we're together. And coming up on 16 hours since first reports of sightings started yesterday. It's 8:00 here in New York... It's 5:00 here. Julie, why'd you let me sleep? Don't worry, they said wall street isn't going to open. Thank . I'd hate to think of what'd happen to the market if it did. Where's Dan rather? He finally lost his voice. He was doing recaps most of the night. Nothing's changed. No contact? No. Ray bradbury was just on with Arthur Clarke. Nothing solid. More speculations. Nobody knows what the hell to think. You're going to the hospital? Yeah, I called. The E.R. is jumping. Lots of heart attack victims and suicide attempts. They need all the med students they can get. And how about stockbrokers? You mean you're coming to help? Sure. I'd kind of like to be with you just in case. Here's the scene in Athens, Greece, the cradle of our western civilization. It somehow seems so insignificant compared to that ship... - I'll get my clothes. - Okay. And this is only 1 of 50 identical spacecraft over 50 cities worldwide. Do you realize that this is a whole new beginning for all of us? I wonder what they'll do first... Danny…this could be the last day we ever see. Well… I don't want to die until I make love. Robin, Daniel! Something's happening! The same occurrence now in Jerusalem. The pulsing signal has also begun. There you see it, and you hear the pulsing tone. Listen... outside. Now the ufo over Los Angeles has joined this strange, unearthly choir. Wait. I'm told that... What? That there's a vocal signal coming through. This may be it, the contact we've been waiting for. It's being picked up on the frequency reserved for international emergencies. We're monitoring, and... 21... 20... - 19... 18... - There. You hear it. It's in english. No, I'm told it's in different languages all around the world. Quatorze... treize... Douze... Onze... Enaire... Deka... Octo... Cheva... Shish... Five... four... Tre... Due... One. Citizens of the planet earth, we bring you greetings, and we come in peace. We respectfully request that the secretary-general of your united nations please come to the top of the united nations building in New York at 0100 greenwich mean time... That's 8:00 New York time. This evening. Thank you. I'm not about to miss this. Mike. I heard you drew the TV pool. - Yeah. - Me, too. Thought I recognized your deck of cards. Hi, Kristine. Hi, Tony. So…where do we set up? You might at least have said good-bye that morning when you left me. Hey, I did. You were on the phone hustling another assignment. Sorry. So was I. 30 seconds now until 8:00. The secretary-general is coming out. He's indicating to the u.N. Troops to lower their weapons, and they're doing so. Just 15 seconds now. He's looking upward, as we all are. And a hush has fallen, not just here, but I'm sure all around the world, as 8:00 strikes, 0100 greenwich mean time... Now. It's opening. There's something coming out. A smaller craft moving down from the giant mothership... It's alright. They said they came in peace. What is it, daddy? I don't know. It's some kind of landing craft? Across 3rd Avenue and 39th, directly towards the u.N. Building. Wow! It's neat, mom, huh? Sure. It's completing its turn now and... Now the craft is coming closer, slowly drifting downward. Mommy, can I have a soda? In a second, honey. The air itself feels strange, vibrating. Herr general sekretariat... Var inte rädd. Kom upp rampen. W-what was that? I couldn't understand. I think the voice spoke Swedish. That's the native language of the secretary-general. I'm getting the translation now. It, uh... - Madre mía. - Seems to be... "Do not be afraid. Please come up the ramp." That's one brave man. And now is disappearing through the opening. - Stanley. - Take it easy. There seems to be activity, but it's too dark... There he is! The secretary-general is reappearing... Oh, thank . Apparently unharmed. My fellow citizens of earth... Now the bad news. These visitors assure me they have come in peace and that they wish to honor all the covenants of our united nations charter. As you will see, theyare much like us, although their voices are unusual. They ask for me to speak on their behalf, but I felt that everyone would be more comfortable if their supreme commander, who is aboard this vessel, spoke directly to all of you. His voice will be heard 'round the world in every language necessary. We can hear footsteps now and... He looks like one of us, a middle-aged man, I'd say roughly 6 feet... He sure looks like one of us. Outwardly. That was no Nash rambler he drove up in. Aw, mom, he's no e.T. He doesn't even look like Mr. Spock. The boots appear to be like kid. The garment looks like... Their evolutionary pattern must have been identical to ours. Does he have four fingers and a thumb? It looks like... yeah! Incredible! I think he's about to speak. I trust that you'll forgive me, but our eyes are unaccustomed to this sort of brightness. His voice is strange. He clearly isn't one of us. It's fascinating, though. We have come in peace to all mankind. You see, in peace. Our planet is the fourth in distance from the star you call Sirius some 8.7 light years... Fantastic. This is the first time we have left our system, and you, the first intelligent life we've encountered. We're pleased to meet you. Our names would sound peculiar to you, so we, my fellow visitors and I, have chosen simple names from earth. My name is John. The secretary-general has referred to me as the supreme commander. Actually, I'm just sort of an admiral responsible for this small fleet around your planet. This small fleet? We have sent other unmanned craft before us. Some have monitored your earth for quite a while so we could learn your languages. But some of us are not as skilled as others, and I hope that you'll be patient with us. We have come on behalf of our great leader, him who governs our united planet with benevolence and wisdom. We have come… because we need your help. Our planet is in serious environmental difficulty, far, far worse than yours. It's reached a stage where we will be unable to survive without immediate assistance. There are certain chemicals and compounds which we must manufacture, which alone can save our struggling civilization. And you can help us to manufacture these. And in return, we will gladly share with you all the fruits of our knowledge. Unbelievable. Yeah. Now that we have established contact, we would like to meet with individual governments to make requests for certain operating plants to be retooled for the manufacture of the compound which we need. I hope they pick your plant. And we'll reward your generosity, as I have said, by educating your industrial and scientific complex to the limits of our knowledge, helping to solve your own environmental, agricultural, and health dilemmas. Then we'll leave you as we came, in peace. Talk about an offer we can't refuse, huh? I wonder what would happen if we did. If our circumstances were reversed and you had visited us, I would feel a burning curiosity to see the inside of your spacecraft right away. An understatement. I would like the secretary-general and several of your journalists to accompany us back aboard our mothership for the first of many opportunities to get to know us better. Hot damn. I was afraid of this. The team, selected earlier by lot, that will provide pool coverage for the media... It's dad! He's going up there. They said Mike Donovan. Look! There he is! I can't believe it. I wonder if this means I'll get more alimony. Of the upi and wide world's jeri Taylor. You see them all preparing for this most remarkable... You worried for him? Since the morning I gave birth to him. The full team now leaving the press area. Would I like to get into his ship. I'd like to get into his DNA. I wonder if there's any kids with them. Don't be stupid, Polly. Why is that stupid? Come on, Polly, cool it. You don't even live here. Mommy, can I have a soda, please? The supreme commander of the visitors, or John as he's asked we call him, John is shaking hands with all the journalists. You see there? They're shaking hands. Mm-hmm. It's great. Huh, father? They're starting up into the shuttle. Now the secretary-general is moving up inside the craft again with jeri Taylor and Sam egan. Kristine Walsh is smiling... If they need refineries, you ought to talk to richland and put a bid in for your plant. - Guess it could be quite… - prestigious. Numerous emmys and other awards for their work. Mike Donovan is about to follow the others and move inside the spacecraft. They're shooting videotape we're most anxious to see. - Good luck. - Are closing again now. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Now the shuttlecraft is lifting off from the roof of the united nations building. Good luck. I love you, dad. Another bottle? Sure. How often do we celebrate our coverage of the story of the century? Keep in mind, we lucked into it. It wasn't luck. I stacked the deck so we'd get the pool. Come on. I really did. Did you put the tape in? You already saw it on the network when it aired. Wasn't it terrific, everyone's reactions? Play it again, Sam. One more time. For those of us accustomed to the likes of close encounters or Darth Vader's futuristic star destroyer, our first glimpses inside of the spacecraft of the visitors were somewhat unexpected... Kris, kris. Try to get a little in the glass. No great walls of lights or other things that science fiction buffs would take in stride. The docking bay looked like the hangar deck of a big aircraft carrier. John tells us this landing bay can handle three dozen shuttlecraft and that there are over 200 other landing bays like this one throughout each of the 50 gigantic motherships. Just your average interstellar welcome wagon. It all seems a little easy, doesn't it? Fast forward, Mike. Your life is on fast forward. You have both male and female in your crew. Of course. This is Diana, second in command. You gave your girlfriend more close-ups than me. - Hello. - hello. Diana's in charge of the scientific aspects of our mission. Shall we go forward to the engine room? This is what you'd call our engine room. - The yellow doors we passed? - - Restricted areas. A lot of radioactivity. Our gravity drive is quite effective, but takes up nearly half the ship. It enables us to travel at great velocity, approaching the speed of light. How long have your people had this technology? About 100 years. You see? - Another close-up! - Whoa! Whoa! Why didn't it work for us before? I'd like to try again. It will be contained within cryogenics. Cryogenics? Supercooled for maximum efficiency in storage. You also mentioned living quarters for the crew. How manyare there on each ship? It varies. Several thousand. Can we talk to some of them? Of course you can, Kristine. You'll have plenty of opportunities. Aren't you glad you called up richland? If we play our cards right, you'll be a senior v.P. Soon. It's been three weeks since our first contact with the visitors. Did you see Mike? Yes. He said hello, but was very busy. I'm sure he is. This is a big event to cover. This refinery in Los Angeles will be the first U.S. plant to officially begin work with the visitors. It will manufacture their synthetic chemical for transport back to Sirius. The raw materials will be our cities' refuse. The visitor technicians are emerging, a scene that will be soon repeated several hundred times in cities all around the world. And there's Diana. I didn't think they'd send so many. I think they look real snappy in those uniforms. - Shoot. - What's the matter, Caleb? "What's the matter?" Look at all those guys. First we had to fight you honkies for a job, then it was the Mexicans, now these creeps. They ain't even from this planet. Gee, how many of them are there? And now a second shuttlecraft is approaching. Mike, how many of them are there? Then the group of visitor technicians moved inside the huge refinery, beginning to familiarize themselves... I thought you had to work. I quit. How come? Their register was short. They blamed me. Dan, you can't keep quitting all your jobs. Dad, would you just get off my case? Who are naturally curious about him and his fellow visitors. Mmm, that's good. After five years of anatomy, it better be. I meant the market. It's really surging up. I think we've got good times ahead. Yes, Kristine, most all the plants we've chosen are located on the coastlines of your world to make convenient and economic use of your sea water. I thought it was a fascinating party. It was our first close encounter with the neighborhood e.T.S. Wasn't Eleanor just in her glory? Wallowing, I'd say. I am pleased she granted us the audience. I felt nervous when I first met him. Did you notice that his hand seemed very cool? Sure, I tried to notice everything I could. Like what? Totally avoids cooked foods. Onlyate a few of the raw vegetables. Outside we were being eaten by mosquitoes. He was not. I saw you trying to talk to him. Sure. I learned a little. They're monogamous. - Oh? - Yeah. Well, the female with him, Barbara, she said that, uh, she isn't his wife. She didn't talk much, seemed real shy. He told me that their planet's much like earth. He said he's no anthroPologist, but he thought that their evolution was similar to ours. It was hard to talk with Arthur stroking him. Arthur couldn't hold a candle to his good old wife. There was something else I noticed. It was real curious. Whenever he walked past the bird cage, they went crazy. They fluttered like mad, like... Panic. Well, anyway... I thought Steven was really quite charming. Oh, really? Going to run off to Sirius? Get serious. Hey! Watch out where the hell you're going. Oh. Excuse. Uh... - Help, please. - Help what? I am just. Just what? Yes. Get out of the way. Damn stupid alien! In response to overwhelming questions and requests by young adults around the world, the visitors' supreme commander, John, has formed the visitors' friends. This organization is open to all young adults, ages 12 to 20, who are anxious to gain special firsthand knowledge of the visitors, to ride in squad vehicles, and have special tours of the motherships. Visitor youth leaders will be coming to your neighborhoods. Oh, my gosh, there he is. He is the same one I saw at the plant. He is such a fox. Looks like a boy to me. Oh, my gosh, he's looking over here. He's really something special. Just think of where he came from. Think of it. Hi there. Are you ok? I am just. Yeah, what? Just! Just... Just. Yes, just. - Just what? - Hmph! Don't let it get you spazzed. I'll help you out. Yes, help. Help to go... To this place. I'm just... You don't know where to go. I'm just. You're lost. Lost. Yes. Lost. English… not well to me. Learn arabic for going there. And they screwed up and sent you to I.A.? Yes... screwed. L.A.'s not so bad. It beats Fresno, let me tell you. What's your name? Uh... William. Hi. I'm harmy. That's short for Harmony. Can you believe it? "Cryo…cryogenic transfer unit." Well, come on, Willy. We'll go find it. The pressure's still not balanced. Must be the inner seal that's bad. Someone will have to go inside. Excuse me. Is this the cryogenic transfer section? Yes. William, where were you? Uh, I was... lost. See you later. Get up there. You'll be working with that man. So you're pleased with the progress here, then? It's representative of all the other plants around the world. Shortly we'll begin our seminars for your scientists. Something else I'm please with, too, Kristine. It's you. Of all the journalists we've met, my people say they feel most comfortable with you. And so do I. Well... Uh, thank you, Diana. We've done research that shows your people have confidence in you. You have? You're trusted, respected, and attractive... Qualities which are essential in our new official spokeswoman. No, Quinton isn't here. There's nothing in his "current" box. I'm not sure what he was working on. He hasn't been here all day, not at all. Yes, I tried at home. There's no answer. What? It is? You're sure it's his car? Press secretary? They said I could call it what I wanted. You like "spokeswoman" better? I don't like the sound of either one. You're jealous. You know I'm not. I don't understand why you want to do it. They want someone the public trusts. And I think it's an excellent career move. What about your objectivity? You don't feel like you're sucking up to them? I'm not sucking up to anybody! Don't you see it's the perfect opportunity to get really inside stuff? Exclusive stuff, material no one else has access to. I'm sure to get a book out of it. I'm going to stay objective. After all, I'm one of us, not them. Any good reporter would be crazy not to jump at this. I'd like to think I had your backing on this, Mike. You know how much I respect you... More than that. I think you better put the steaks back in the freezer. What? Oh, yeah, tonight's a problem 'cause Diana wants to meet... How did you know? Aah! Aah! Aah! Caleb! Liquid nitrogen broke the inner seal. There's no way you can get down there and get to him. William, stop! For 's sake! William went in there after Caleb. It's 300 degrees below zero down there. There's no way a human being could... Over here! Bring him over here! Where are the cultures, Ruth? They're not back from pathology. They're running way behind. I heard two key people didn't show up today. Didn't even call. That's odd. Dr. Taylor. Ben, it's Julie. Get down to E.R., stat. They just brought in your father. Daniel is not taking care of anything. Abraham, he's only 17. Don't be so hard on him. Daniel has been this way for years. He's no good in school, he has hardly any friends. Well, maybe this visitor friends group will be just the thing he needs. He just hasn't found his niche yet, that's all, unlike others we could mention. Sorry I'm late. You kept me waiting, naughty boy. Little problem at the plant. Arthur said he'd join us in a while. Good. That's the supervisor's vehicle below. I understand he visits there a lot. She can be charming. So you get to visit your son this afternoon, huh? Yeah. Where does he live? In a small town outside of I.A. Dad! Hey, dad! Dad! Who are you today, huh? Fernando valenzuela or Steve sax? Just Sean Donovan. Come see what Josh has got. How many visitors does it take to change a light bulb? Tell me. None. They like the lights out. - How you doing, Josh? - Hi. See, dad? Check it out. He's got a squad vehicle and the action figure, the supreme commander, - and Diana. - Oh. Ha... Wonder if they get a royalty. He's got a mothership. I got them all. Can I get them, dad? Mom said we didn't have the money, but... Well, I'll ask her about it, but in the meantime... What is it? It's just something I picked up off a squad vehicle. A real squad vehicle? It came from the visitors themselves? Guy, check it out. Let me see it. In a minute. Hey, you guys, your pizza's ready. Okay, mom. You coming in, dad? In a second. Look, mom. It's from a squad... Your dinner's getting cold. So... What's the matter now? Nothing. It's just a little tough trying to compete with someone who flies around in spaceships. What am I supposed to do, give up my job? And what am I supposed to do... Sprout wings, fly him off to never-never land? How else can I compete... With pizza? Why compete? Why not do something of your own? Whatever happened to your college plans... Please. Don't start, okay? Ohh. You got a tissue sample from a visitor's skin? How? When they brought Ben's father into emergency, there were some flakes of skin on his shirt from the visitor who saved him. That's terrific. Dr. Metz will be delighted. Maybe. Goodnight, Julie. Ruth... Ruth, what's wrong? It's Dr. Metz, isn't it? You really love him, don't you? Does he know? I'm just a piece of lab equipment. Well… starting tomorrow, we're going to go to work on him, and we'll make him see that nobel's not the only prize he's got. You darling. - Goodnight, Julie. - Goodnight. A little shaky, pop? I'll be alright. Just let me do it by myself. You got it. Hey, my man Ben. What it is? "What it is?" It's bad grammar, my brother. Elias, when are you going to stop this poor man's Richard pryor act? What you talkin', man? Brother, this ain't no act. This here is pure-d Elias. Well, it's pure-d something. Look, man, we can't all of us be Dr. Kildare. Know what I mean… uncle Tom? Come on, that uncle Tom stuff doesn't work anymore. You can be anything that you want to be, but first you gotta get rid of this tap dance and this two-bit crook routine and start to grow up. Oh, yeah? Yeah, okay. Well, once again we thank you... Mr. Sidney poitier. Thank you. Yo, pop, how you doing, man? You'll never guess... The visitor youth leader. You saw him? Isn't he a hunk? I know. I brought the phone outside so I could watch for him. Oh, wouldn't you just die? I know and did you see his eyes? They're gorgeous. Sure, I saw them. He looked at me quite a while the other day. I mean, not just looking, but real meaningfully, you know, like two ships passing in the night, like really romantic. I think he kind of likes me, - but he's just shy. - Excuse me. My life is over. - Did I startle you? - Uh, no. No. - I'm Brian. - Right. Uh, Robin. - Hi. - Hi. Ahem. I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous. You are. You are? Yeah. It's not every day I meet somebody from another planet. I never thought of that before. It must be just as weird for you... Not that you're weird or anything. You know what I mean... Which is Daniel's home? Uh, it's the one over there on... On the right. - Thanks. - Sure. Oh, . Would you like to take a walk? Um... okay. - May I see that? - Sure. Hey, hero! Willy! Hello, Harmony. Everybody's raving about the way you rescued Caleb. They said your face was blistered. You look okay to me. You want a burger? No. Don't you guys ever eat? Sometimes. You go to movies? No, I do not... yet. Well? Hmm? Ah. You are fun? What? Feeling better... Feeling fun. Fine. Fine, yes. - Fine? - Eh, I'm okay. Yeah. Look, uh... - William. - William, look, I'm sorry I called you a stupid alien. Oh, no, no, no. Here. Huh? The world was shocked today when nobel prize winner Dr. Morris jankowski of the Brussels biomedical institute in Belgium held a press conference to reveal the existence of an international conspiracy against the visitors. It came to my attention when Dr. Rudolph Metz in California asked to speak with me on what he called "urgent, confidential matters." Other colleagues of mine are also being approached by scientists... Primarily biomedical and anthroPological scientists... From many nations who apparently are part of this insidious conspiracy. What are their plans? Their plans, quite simply, are to seize control of several motherships belonging to the visitors. But why? They tried hard to convince me this was to protect the human race, or to keep such powers from the military on our planet. I do believe, however, that their motivation is, by far, more personal. Then jankowski signed his statement, listing those he claims tried to bring him into this conspiracy. When word began to spread of the jankowski statement, the international scope revealed itself, as scores of scientists around the world came forward to admit they had been approached, or actually confessed that they were part of the conspiracy. Seen here is Dr. Jacques duvivier, also a nobel laureate, physician, and leading biochemist in France... Damn scientists. Who was detained by the suret é and has confessed to his involvement, naming other scientists as his co-conspirators. It's a lie, a vicious lie. You don't need a warrant. Search my files. There's nothing. You'll find nothing. What's that? I never saw that. No. It's not true. I don't know how this got there. It's a lie, I tell you. And many other scientists... Quinton's still missing? And a half-dozen others. The Police don't have a clue what's happening. They have simply vanished, which, some think, lends credence to the charges brought against them. Kristine Walsh, press secretary for visitor supreme commander, John, had this to say. The visitors were shocked to learn of this conspiracy and fearful of the chaos which could possibly result. Not only would their own needs be impaired, but all the benefits they plan to share with us could be endangered. Scientific seminars planned for next week will be postponed. And because it's still too early to determine how many scientists are involved, the u.N. Has agreed to visitor requests that all scientists and their family members must register their whereabouts with local authorities. Computers will be used to verify their registration. Don't get so wound up. Nothing's going to happen to you or your family. They're not doctors or biologists or even scientists. You're not involved. Anyway, it's going to pass. That's what I said in 1938 back in Berlin. But this is different. Is it? Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** The supreme commander wants to make it clear that while he's sure all scientists all over aren't part of the conspiracy, it's difficult to ascertain which of them may not be. While Police have scoured scientific files for facts on the conspiracy, startling evidence is being found that many scientists have actually had major breakthroughs in research which they've suppressed. Senate medical affairs committee chairman Raymond Burke had this to say. Yes, indeed, I do have evidence that revolutionary cancer treatments do exist and have existed for some time, along with many other breakthroughs which apparently our scientific friends kept quiet about and haven't shared with us. Why would they do that? I won't speculate except to say there's a lot of money to be made in research grants. I'm sorry I'm late, but Dr. Metz is really hurting. Ruth has completely disappeared. Take your time. They called to cancel dinner. Oh, honey, you must be really disap... Pointed. Yeah. You think you'll still get their account? I don't think so. They were... Too Polite, you know? I don't understand. How can they treat you like that? Denny... Do you think it's me? They know that I'm a biochemist and a med student. No. How could it be you? Well, you, uh... Seem a little too Polite. Yeah. I saw this before. So? Something struck me funny when I saw this yesterday, but I couldn't figure it out. All night I'm trying to sleep then suddenly it hits me. Now look at this. It's a tape we shot of him at the science fair last year. Remember I had him autograph that book? Yeah. Don't you see, Mike? He used his right hand. And yesterday… he used his left hand. So he's ambidextrous? No. No, he's not, and neither is duvivier. I checked. No, Mike. Until this week, they were both right-handed. Something very strange is going on here. Come on. I'm not very good at this. Brian... what's it like out there? It's magnificent. Very peaceful. Which one's yours? Um... Right there. It's the brightest. It's in a constellation you call canis major. It must be strange to be so far away from home. Yeah, it is. But new friends make it easier. I'm glad. Hi, Robin. - Daniel. - Danny. How's your father? He's fine. You know, uh... It must be pretty tough nowadays, being a scientist, especially an anthroPologist. Yeah. - Hi, Daniel. - Hi. How are you? Good. Her father's an anthroPologist, huh? - You didn't know? - No. I had no idea. Yeah. Look, Mike, wouldn't it be a good idea to just take the squad vehicle? This way, they won't know we're on board. We've a better chance of finding out what's going on. Okay. They got the chemical loaded on board. Get ready. Now. Uhh! Agh! Mike. Come on. I can't come out. I can't get my foot up. Come on. I got you. Come on. Damn. Tanker unit 14, stand by for venting operation. Tanker unit 14, stand by for venting operation. Ready? Open the flow. What a waste of time... Bringing all these chemicals up here and dumping them out. Tanker arrival schedule is as follows... From Los Angeles, at 2100 hours. From Santa Barbara, at 2114 and 2142 hours. From San Diego at 2150, 2200, and 2215 hours. All tanker units check with the ready room for late changes in assignments. All tanker units check with the ready room for late changes in assignments. Every continent will soon be under our complete domination. You must be pleased. Well, let's just say that it pleases me to serve our leader with whatever minor talents I possess. John said our leader's pleased with your conversion process. Yes, but you know how impatient our leader is. Even with you? I thought that, given the intimacy of your relationship with him, he might... Be very careful, Steven. I just hate to see him make you so distressed. He doesn't understand that my conversion process is still limited. It doesn't work the same on every human subject. No. But when it does work, as with duvivier and jankowski, it's remarkable. Yes, it is. They actually believe a conspiracy exists, or even that they're part of it. The evidence we planted reinforces their beliefs. The operation is working perfectly. Scientists are being ostracized, disorganized throughout the world. The problem is, our leader then says "why not convert them all." He doesn't understand that the human will is much tougher than we bargained for. To convert them all would take forever. However, we will continue to refine the process. Yes. I'm sure you will, successfully. We must find the most effective methods to be used against them. Our leader couldn't have chosen anyone who could do a better job than you. Particularly given the success of your previous accomplishments. Well, the longer we can keep the public's confidence... I'm tired of all these drills. Emergency situation on level 73. All units to standby alert. All units to standby alert. Emergency situation on level 73. All units to standby alert. Okay, everybody, let's go. We got a hot one. All three cameras. Hello, New York? Okay, listen up. We're going to do an interrupt. Alert all the affiliates... Full network. Yes, damn right. Mike Donovan's got a tape to knock our socks off. We're feeding bars and tone right now. You know, it's leaving here. Check patching. Stand by that tape. We're ready. Why would they take that chemical to the mothership and just dump it into the air? Here they come. Get double Mikes on them right now. I'll do the setup, intro you, and we'll roll the tape. You tell them what you saw. We've got 30 seconds. Give me lights now. Coming up. Camera one, I'll start with two. You okay, Mike? 10 seconds. Quiet on the line! Let's get a doctor on standby for Mike. 5 seconds, 4... 3... 2... 1. New York, take your slide. And cue announce. The following is a special report from Los Angeles. Take two. Cue clete. An astonishing occurrence just took place aboard the mothership just off... What the hell happened? Hold on! Problem on the line. What the hell's going on? They what? - We've lost ma bell. - We've what? Somebody's pulled at&t out from under us. They pulled the plug. The whole damn network's off the air. So are both the others. What's that, Bert? Hello? Hello? And now I've lost New York. No, I cannot patch. Here's something. This is Kristine Walsh. The visitors' supreme commander, John, is here to make a statement. My friends throughout the world, first, I must thank the leaders of each of your countries who have, in the interests of peace, turned over all their broadcasting facilities to us in this crisis. I'm sad to say there's been a carefully coordinated and violent attempt by the conspiracy of scientists to commandeer control of our facilities at key locations around the world. I don't believe it. This is dupre. - Have we been hit? - Tokyo and Cairo... Oh, thank goodness. Damn scientists. At least two dozen other places suffered similar assaults. The loss of life has been enormous. I don't believe this is happening. Believe it. Thousands have been wounded, and we're fearful there will be more attacks. I'm going to the hospital. The outbreak is so widespread and so dangerous that most civilian members of your governments have asked us for protection, which we're more than happy to provide. They're safe aboard our ships. We'll take good care of them. I'm also very sorry to report this man, in whom we had placed considerable trust, Michael Donovan of the United States, proved to be the biggest traitor... No! It isn't true! He's considered armed and dangerous. Where's my tape? They're setting up to copy it right now. Man, we're in big trouble. Tell me about it. Get going. Mike! Mike, your tape! Your national leaders have suggested that a state of martial law will be most helpful at this time. And we agree. Police at local levels will work with our visitor patrols. We will also ask the help of all our visitor friends units everywhere. We anticipate this crisis will pass relatively quickly. In the meantime, friends, I and my fellow visitors will do our best to see you through it and maintain control. There will be more announcements later. Got to go. It'll pass. You heard what he said. Right, dad? Everywhere around the nation and the world, visitors are keeping order and making friends. Police and military forces in each country are cooperating fully. The clear and present danger still exits, however, from the group of terrorists who brought about the need for martial law by their assaults. These attacks by scientist conspirators are still continuing sporadically and violently around the world. In Buenos Aires last night... We've been very lucky not to have that happen at our plant. Several cryogenic storage tanks containing the synthetic chemical were damaged, but heroic efforts by the visitor technicians saved them and the lives of 15 workers. How could they be faking all these scenes? The movies do it all the time. Curfew at 8:00 each evening still must be maintained. It's unfair. I wanna go out some nights. Why? Daniel comes by here. It isn't Daniel I want to see. - Who, Robin? - Never mind. Reminded of the need to stay in their locale. Of course the military are cooperating fully. They're all under house arrest. Mrs. Maxwell. Hello, Sancho. What's the matter? I can't work for you no more. Why not? It's... Well, tell me. It's the other people I work for. They know I work for you. They don't like it. Why should the other people... Because my husband is a scientist? They say I could either work for them or for you. My family, they... That's okay. Never mind. I understand. Polly, are you hurt? - What happened? - I got in a fight. A bunch of jerkos beat up on me because my project won the science fair. They wrecked it, said I was just a dirty little scientist's kid. You should've seen them when I got through. How many were there? Four. What happened to your teachers, didn't they see? One did, but he just walked the other way. I guess I better fix my bike. Thanks, Mr. Bernstein. Are you going to Manhattan to your folks? No. I... I can't get through to them. It's better if you don't know anyway. I'll, uh... I'll get the rest later. Don't you think you're overreacting slightly? No. I don't want you losing more accounts because of me. - Look, we don't know for sure. - No, we don't! And that's the really nasty part. They're always so Polite, but we know, don't we? Anyway, uh... Another biochemist, Phyllis, remember her? Well, uh... She didn't show today, and nobody's heard from her. Just like Ruth and all the others. Maybe she just went away. Just like this. Maybe she was taken. There's no truth to those rumors. Shall I stay then? I think you should do whatever makes you happy. See you, Denny. Aah! Oh, Robert! Oh! And there were even fewer incidents of violence today. It seems people everywhere are starting to report in to authorities when they suspect someone might be involved with a conspiracy. This early warning will save countless lives. The supreme commander urges you... I'm so tired of her face and only hearing one side of what's going on. Well, the truth is the truth. Then why not let some others say it? Don't you think you've had enough? No. I do. Come on, Stanley. There's the newspaper, too, you know. Yeah, and it says exactly what she says. Sometimes it's word for word. It's not just that. It's everything. Look at these bills. The price is up on everything. Try to make a damn long distance call. You need a special permit. Most times you can't get through. You always said this would pass. It had better hurry up before we sink. I want things back the way they were. Where's Daniel? Not looking for a job, I'm sure. Stanley. You've got to be more careful what you say. - What, in my own house? - But he lives here. You know how totally involved he is with them. Alright. I know that. But he shouldn't have... I have heard stories... Rumors. Stories about how some member of his group had actually... What... informed? On his own parents. And they disappeared. Well, Lynn, I hardly think that Dan... Well, I hardly think so, too, but... I mean, what's to inform on? We're not scientists. It's not like I said anything. But you were very critical of her and of them, of the newspapers, everything. Of him. He shouldn't drink that much. But that's not all you said. All I said was I was tired of hearing... One side of the news... their side. Well... I meant... Hearing only one opinion. No, not that. I meant... You don't really think he'd call them, do you? Where have you been, Daniel? Just in the bathroom. You think he's lying? I don't wanna go to the mountains. I hate our place there. - Please, dad? - Get in the car. Robin, try to understand. Too many things are happening. A scientist your father works with was arrested for conspiracy. Polly got beaten up at school. And Quinton is still missing. Why don't we stay and fight? It's not that easy, Pol. Oh, . Daddy is no conspirator. Neither were they! Get in the car. All my friends are here. Especially ones in uniform. Shut up, Polly. Please! I can stay with Karen and her family. Right now, Robin. Please. It's alright. I think. Alright. Look, we know what's happening... Totalitarian suppression of the truth. Not only on television, but they've got the papers, too. We're under martial law. And paranoia. Everyone I know, especially scientists, are getting scared to death. Or disappearing. Like my partner or any other cop who refused to go along with the visitors when they requested we help them maintain order. Yesterday they took another doctor and his family from my building. Why are they so anxious to arrest so many scientists? They must think we're a threat, that we might find a way to stop them. There's no way to stop them. There's too many of them. No. There has to be a way. There is. Well, we organize. Look, any complex structure, like our bodies, for example, starts with individual cells. The cells will reproduce, expand themselves, and join with others. That's lovely in biology, but... Listen, Brad! I... I'm sorry. I know that we're embryonic. There's only a handful of us. But you can be sure, we're not the only ones huddled in the dark. I know there are others like us, across America, around the world. We're not the only ones who want to fight this. She's right. What we've got to do is find the others who feel like we do. Then we all look for more and more. We need equipment for a lab, communication, all of that. - And a headquarters. - Yeah. We should find out who's closest to the visitors and get them on our side. Like that Kristine… Walsh! Yes. She's surely on the inside. Maybe too much on the inside. One of us should contact her. - Yes. - Yes. I'll find her and if we can trust her. Let's meet here Thursday night. - Fine. - Sounds good. Everybody has to bring at least four others. How about that? Agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. Is that you, uncle Pedro? Uncle Pedro? It is you. Buenos noches. Tony, cut the... We've been having trouble with the phone. Understand? Trouble with the phone. Then you must be all tapped out. You got it, uncle. The repairmen even came to check things out. A whole lot of them. Smelled your cooking. Would they like your burrito. Yeah, I'm sure they would. Yeah, but I like Italian food much better, though, remember? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Don't let me keep you standing there. I know you have to run. Good luck. Another one. How come they want to keep us in the city? Easier to find us. W hy's that important? We're not sure, Pol, but it is. Stop him! Halt! Get him! Another scientist? No, but he was helping one run the roadblock. He gets to share their treatment. Easy, Bob. He's wounded. It's his fault. Break the law, take the consequences. - Man, this is different. - It ain't! A crook's a crook. Ain't nothing changed except the guys who give the orders. How will we get through here? - Will we fight? - No. Now where will we go? - Who's going to help us? - I don't know. I do. Turn the car around. The big, bad doctor needs my help, huh? How come? You've contacts on the street. You're damn right, I do. Ain't you always putting down the streets? Yeah, but times have changed. Yeah, well, the streets ain't. They ain't changed a bit. There's just another man out there to be the man. The streets are getting a hell of a lot better. Dude can make a whole lot of money there now. Black market. You ought to pardon the expression, brother. Any idea how much fresh fruit's going for these days? And beef? I make more selling hamburger than I did selling reefer. Keep doing all you want, but a group of us is trying to fight this thing. It don't affect me, except to line my pockets. What's happening is wrong. Says who? I need your help. Where were you when I needed yours? I was always there for you. Yeah, except a little unapproachable. The golden boy. Man, that's only in your head. If I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times. "Why can't you be like brother Benjamin, the doctor?" Now you need my help? That's right. Well, I'd sure like to, but I got to go to the medical library and do my studying. I'll catch you later, brother. Lynn and Stanley never use this place. It's just for storage. Dad it's gross. We can't live here. It's filthy. We can clean it. - No way it's ever... - Robin, that's enough. It's fine, Abraham. Thank you. Forgive my daughter's... It's alright. I understand. I'm not sure I do. Father, can I talk to you outside? I really don't believe you brought them here. They have nowhere to go. Their house is being watched now. And so is ours by Daniel. Tell them we're sorry. Stanley, you don't understand. They have to stay. They need a place to hide. And why is that? Because the father is a scientist. And therefore suspect and a fugitive I take it, which makes them doubly dangerous. They have to stay. Just get them out of here. - I won't. - Then I will. No, you won't! We had to put you in a suitcase. In a suitcase. You were 8 months old. That's how we smuggled you out. I know the story. No, you don't. You don't. Your mother, shalom, your mother didn't have a heart attack in the boxcar. She made it with me to the camp. I can still see her standing naked in the freezing cold. Her beautiful black hair was gone. They had shaved her head. I can still see her waving to me as they marched her off with the others to the showers... The showers with no water. Perhaps if somebody had given us a place to hide... Don't you see, Stanley? They have to stay, or else we haven't learned a thing. Mike. My , you scared the hell out of me. I've been so worried for you. I've been worried for me, too. Why are they so hot to capture you? Because I've seen their faces. What? You don't believe me, do you? Well, it's so incredible... Reptilian with tongues that... It's all true. I've seen it. I really do believe you think you've seen it. Think? Damn it. I work so closely with these people, it's hard to... Be objective. This is a waste of time. - Don't leave yet. - Why? Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** If I could see the tape you shot... It's hidden. Mike, listen... We started this together, and it's possible you're right. Maybe I did get closer to them than I should. It's funny. You're the one I always wanted to be closer to. You've got a funny way of showing it. I'd really like another chance. Aah! Thanks. Aah! Hey. Danny. You scared me. What are you doing here? When everybody went to sleep, I snuck out. I'm not supposed to be here, but I couldn't stand your pool house another minute. Wait. Our pool house? It's too small for one of us, but five? It's totally outrageous. You've been drinking. Yeah. With Brian? He was there. He doesn't drink. I don't think he can hold it. Did he ask about me? No. He supposed to? Well, I thought he might. Well, not tonight, he didn't. You know, I'm very glad to see you. You look very pretty. Other nights, though? What? He asks about me other nights? Yeah, well, sometimes. Yeah, I guess. He wondered where you went. So we both did. Me, especially, till I found out you were in my pool house. Remember when you said you didn't want to die till you made love? Do you still feel that way? Sure. Is he still a virgin, do you think? Who? Brian. Good. This stuff ought to help us find their weaknesses. Let's get a move on. I'm not sure whether they bought my act. Where's Ben? Go, go, go, go! Wake up, Julie! Let's go! Go get her! What are you stopping for? I'm going back for Ben. We can't leave him. - You're crazy! - We can't leave him there! Julie! Julie! Julie! Ben! Oh, my . Oh, my . Julie, no. No. Go on. Go on. Get out of here. I'm not going to make it. 6 bucks for a dozen clucks. Caleb here? What happened? Ben's been hurt. What went down? We were stealing lab equipment. They shot him. What, the doc? Stealing stuff? You ought to come to me. I'll show you how to do it. They got you, too? May... maybe I ought to go get an ambulance. No. No ambulance. We've already made our diagnosis, haven't we, doctor? What you want to pull a heist for, bro, man, without your little brother's expertise? We did it, though. The truck did get away? But look at you, bro. You a wreck. - You just can't go do this. - Is papa here? No, uh... No, he ain't get here yet. Uh... Now, listen here, man, now, do I try doctoring? Course not. Course not. The next time, bro, you try and boost stuff, you'll come to me first. I'll show you how to do it. Ain't nothing to it. Like lifting these eggs, man. Shoot. Sound like papa now. Shoot. He'll be along here any minute now. Elias. You going to come to me, right? We'll take them on together, bro, yeah. Just the two of us. The bad Taylor brothers, yeah! Elias. They'll say, whoa, man! Whipping through here and jazz. Bad, bad Taylor brothers. Oh, yeah. Taylor brothers, man. Doctor, yeah... Doctor and, uh... Doctor and, uh... Doctor and the other one. The other one. Elias. No! No. The doctor cannot die. Oh, yeah, sure, the other one can die. He can die, but... Not... Not... Not… not Ben. Not Ben. Aw, damn it, Ben. Damn it. No! If you're going to do it, do it right. I'll show you. You understand? For victory. Go tell your friends. Hello? No, don't shoot me! Josh. Where is everybody, huh? - I don't know. They're gone. - How long ago? About three days. You've been alone since then? Well, you're not alone anymore. What happened? A lot of people getting tired of what the visitors are doing. A bunch of ranch hands came to town, threw a bomb right into the squad vehicle. The local supervisor got inside. They blew it up and killed him. Everybody was shouting about how we're in America and they weren't going to stand for these damn visitors no more. There was clapping and cheering. Suddenly these lights were in the sky, boring down. Some people screamed and ran. Some shot guns. They kept on coming, the shock troopers. A lot of them, a whole lot of them. I lost my mom and dad, but Sean's mom grabbed me. She pulled us into the house. But then there were these lights and noise. She slammed the door. Get back! But they were everywhere outside. Then I saw these awful eyes. It's okay, kiddo. You're alright now. And then what happened? They broke through the door and took them. He fought really hard. He kicked at them to leave his mom alone. He fought and fought and said his dad would get them. He was real brave, Sean was. But me... I… I... I hid back in the closet. I was scared. I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan. I should've helped. Josh. Hey. Come on, don't beat yourself up about it. There wasn't anything you could've done. What happened then? They took them, everybody to the square. There was a lot of shouts and crying. And then the lights were gone, so was everybody... Everyone but me. "I only have escaped alone to tell thee." Mr. Donovan, will I ever see my mom and dad again? You bet. Josh. When I came to visit Sean, I brought him something. Yeah, I remember. What'd he do with it, do you know? Yeah, it's over here. - What is it? - It's a key. That's going to get you into what? The belly of the whale. Come on, kiddo. Champagne for breakfast. Classy. - Where'd you get it? - From a local merchant. One who knows the value that a friend can be. And now... A toast. To my engagement. What? To whom? To Robin Maxwell. But she's gone away. Well... Not that far away, huh? What does Robin think about this, Dan? Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. See, I want her, uh, just like I wanted this champagne. And I will get her, won't I? Otherwise, I'll just have to turn her whole damn family in. - Aah! - Come on! Stop it, Danny! You cretin! - I'm not going anywhere with you! - I said come on! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Come on! Daniel! Caleb? I am sad… for you. We both are, Caleb. Get them away! I don't want your kind around here. But, Caleb... Go on! Get out of here! We felt bad. We wanted to... - Go on! - Come on. Come on, dad. You people killed my boy! They killed him! Now you go on and get out of here! Willy, Willy, come on. You tried. Come on. You go back to where you belong! You people killed my boy! Hear me? Go on now! Go on! Get out of here! Yeah, but they'll Grant my family amnesty, right? Just like we arranged. Who is this family that's in hiding anyway? Oh, um, they're just a bunch of scientists. Shalom. Is everything alright? It's okay so far. Now we have to run the roadblock. Katie honey, be quiet. Everything's alright. We're never gonna make it with her crying. Okay, try this. It'll help. You come prepared. I've had some experience at this. - Hello? - Hello. I have a question. If I thought I knew someone, a scientist, perhaps... Was being smuggled out, what should I do? Well, I'm not interested in a reward, of course. Shh! Katie, be quiet. Mom, dad, keep her quiet. Here's another chocolate. Hi, officer. - How are you? - Where are you headed? - El tepeyac. - What? El tepeyac. El tepeyac. What are you talking about? I know all the towns around here. Where's this El tepeyac? It's a restaurant out of town. Best food north of ensenada. El tepeyac? I never heard of it. What's the story back there? No story. It's okay. Alright, let's move it out, then, Pedro. Thank you, officer. Careful, baby, ain't going to be easy, you walking down here with that cane. Well, I'm going to have to get used to it. Anyway, uh, tunnel runs down underneath the city. Uh, connects up with some really nifty places. I know it ain't the Beverly hills hotel, you dig? But there's a lot of space down underneath, and, well, some bums sleep here sometimes. Well, we'll take anyone we can get. I'm really glad to hear that. Of course the electricity doesn't work. I'll handle that. That's okay, then? It's perfect. Dynamite. Listen, while you guys are getting your stuff moved in, I'm gonna go rap with the angels. You see, like all of this here is like on their turf. You think you can get them to help us? You kidding, mama? You are talking to the Henry kissinger of east I.A. - Catch you later. - Okay. Elias? Yes? Uh, hello. Yeah, this is Daniel. Who took my father? They said arrested? But they promised amnesty. They said... Uh, yeah, hi. Lynn Bernstein, please. Well, wait. What time did she go to lunch? Well, that was four hours ago. No, she's not at home! Yes, I'm sure. I'm at home alone. Here comes our boy. Back from El tepeyac? Yeah, looks like he had somebody hidden back here, but they're, uh, gone now. What is it? Just a token of appreciation for your... Hospitality. Oh, Steven. So what's the plan? Well, Josh needs to stay with Fran. That's okay with me. - You like spaghetti? - Yeah, sure. Okay, we'll get along just fine. Now, there's a rebel camp up in the hills... Like in El Salvador? Yeah, just like in El Salvador, where a bunch of doctors and other rebels are holed up. I've heard of another place somewhere downtown, but I don't know which building. We'll find it, but first, I wanna see what this unlocks. They've got to have some achilles' heel, some weakness, something we can use against them. And we need to find out where the people are who disappeared. Daniel. I know you must be very disappointed in me. My superiors decided to take your family in for questioning... But they'll be home soon. - They will? - You have my word. - And grandfather, too? - He isn't well. He's with our doctors, though, and they're very good. They hope to have him feeling better soon. How about you? You feeling better now? Uh... yeah. I guess so. Well, I have some news that ought to help some. You're getting a promotion... To my second in command. - What? - Yes. Congratulations. Uh… - that's not all. When I informed Diana of your loyalty, she gave me this reward for you. Brian. I'm glad you like it, and I'm proud to have you in my unit. Yeah. You even know how to use that thing? I'm sort of winging it. This thing controls the intensity, I think, how strong a jolt it shoots. And you prime it over here. Come with extra batteries? - They're rechargeable, I think. - Clever, those Japanese. Look out. How are we going to handle him? How about the direct approach? Excuse me! Uh, uh, hello. Uh, look, I'm really sorry to bother you like this, but I'm on my way to Korea, and my shrimp boat gets a flat tire. So I really need an inner tube. Get his gun. Go! Go! Alright. Same drill. Only this time, I'm not going to trip. Come on. I can't make this stupid thing work! Safety's over here. Go! Mike! Up the catwalk. Go! Ah! Oh! Mike! My eyes! Tony! Tony! Tony! Ah! Okay, Laurie, it's around the corner, second door on your left, alright? - Juliet parish? - Yes? Robert Maxwell, anthroPology. This is my daughter Robin. Hello. They said you were organizing things out here. - They did? - Yeah. Well, come on. We're getting things prepared so we can bring down all of our equipment from the mountain camp. We're trying to make things liveable... Or just plain safe. Hey, Julie, where's the water cutoff? I don't know, Louise. Try that room in there. I don't think there's anyplace that's really safe. You're right. The toilets, by the way, are through there. - They're very picturesque. - I'll bet. This is our poor man's BBC. The kitchen is over there. Oh, Robin, be careful of the elevators. Yeah, I see the hole. Well, she's thrilled to be here. It's not the galleria. I thought she'd really go crazy at the mountain camp. A lot of good stuff up there, electronic microscopes. Yeah, that's all of our sophisticated equipment. We've gotta get it down here. Julie, where do you want me to put this? Julie, where do you want the sterilizer? Elias, put that in that room. Brad, over there. Robert, here. Julie, I can't find the water cutoff. Here. Let me help you. Ow! Aah! Juliet, are you alright? Oh, Ruby. I can't handle this. I was supposed to be a scientist... A doctor... Not a plumber or some kind of rebel. They all look at me like I know what to do. And you're just as lost and scared as we are. More. These are the times that try men's souls. I'll tell you why we look to you. Because you're a natural... - A natural leader. - Oh, I don't feel that. But you don't have to. All you need to do is trust your instincts. Trust yourself as much as everybody else trusts you. If I can't? Fake it. We won't know the difference. How are you feeling? How would you feel? Where's Tony? She's ready for him. Who is? Several times you've caused a bit of trouble, Mr. Donovan. That's nothing to the trouble you've caused, lady... Lady... that's a good one. You'll soon have no more worries, Mr. Donovan. I'll be with you in a moment. You know, Diana, rather than putting Mr. Donovan away, he might prove very useful to us as a convert. My instincts tell me that he'd be too difficult as a subject. That's why I decided not to bother. Take him to the final area. I always thought you thrived on challenges. I do, but I like better odds. That's curious. I would have thought you'd find the difficult game far more interesting. But, anyway, you're probably right. I don't think even you, with all of your abilities, could ever turn this head of his. Martin, wait. Don't take him to the final area just yet. Perhaps I would enjoy the challenge of converting him. Well, as you wish, Diana. - Listen, Mike, we're gonna get you out of here. - You're what? It's very dangerous, but not more dangerous than waht would happen if you stayed. You talked her into converting me, and you expect me to believe you? I was buying time, you idiot. I'm sorry, Mike. Look, some of us, a very few of us, just don't believe in what our leader's doing... or his plans. What are his plans? I don't have time to tell you now. I've got to get you out. - With Tony. - That's impossible. - Then I'm staying. - Mike. I'm not leaving without him! Mike, it's too late for Tony. What the hell they do to him? - Quiet! - That damn dragon lady can bend people's minds. What the hell does she need a blowtorch for? Conversion is a very difficult and time-consuming operation. When Diana simply needs some information, she'll do whatever's most effective... And efficient, and she likes to do it. God Almighty. Help us. Be ready. Oh! Take your shoes off. Your shoes! Hurry. Martin couldn't make it, so you'll have to wear my uniform. Oh, lots of luck. I'll never be able to... It'll stretch enough to fit. - You sure don't look like an iguana. - What? Bad taste. - Why are you and Martin doing this? - Because it's right. How many more of you are there? Not enough, not nearly, and there's gonna be one less if you don't hurry. - What happens next? - Take these. A shuttlecraft is on its way up now. I think you should be able to slip aboard, if you keep your glasses on and your mouth shut. Yeah. My voice is sure a tip-off. Alright, do you know how to use this? - Like the rifle, yeah? - Yeah. Thanks. - Alright. Now, shoot me. - What? It's absolutely necessary, or they won't believe my story. - Will you live? - Of course. At least, I hope so. I don't even know your name. It's Barbara. Godspeed, Mike. Please… do it. Do it. Trooper units 14 and 15 to the ready room, please. Trooper units 14 and 15 to the ready room. Trooper unit 36 and technician unit 1, squad shuttle in bay 12, level 1. Trooper unit 36 and technician unit 4, squad shuttle in bay 12, level 1. No. I don't mind the duty down there. Do you mind the duty down there? He says he doesn't like all those angry people, but I'll tell you, they don't bother me. They bother you? I haven't seen you around before. What unit you with? Nice talking to you. Aren't you going to say goodbye? You hear me? I want to hear you say goodbye. What are you doing? Wait! Goodbye! Halt! Stop! Hey, Jimmy, you're crazy, man. Yo, angels, come here. What's happening, baby? Check it out, man. You hardly ever see them out alone. Yeah, Julie really wants the chance to study one of them up close, find out what makes 'em tick. What say we pay the visitor a visit? Yeah, right. Alright. Hey, Julie! Whoo! Whoo! Julie, special delivery. - Hey, hey. - Gonna pulverize him. - Let's get this dude. - Right here. Careful of his gun. Okay. You're a bunch of stupid bozos. What the hell do you think you're doing, huh? - Doesn't sound like one of 'em. - He's not. You're damn right I'm not. But he might be a sympathizer. Sympathi... I don't suppose you have a bandage I could borrow, do you? Over here. Put your guns down, for God's sake. Who's in charge here? I guess you could say she is. Who is, her? That kid? She's one smart kid. Are you coming, or would you like to keep on bleeding? You walk with a cane, huh? - You get hurt, too? - A little. - Where'd you get the uniform? - They had a sale... ow! - You did that on purpose. - I did not. Where'd you get the uniform? On board their ship. Couple of them helped me to escape. - They did? Why? - Beats the hell out of me. - Sounds like a setup. - I don't think so... ow... Don't you have any novocain? I do, but I have to save it. Now, sit still. You are a doctor. More or less. Well, that's comforting. You don't think it's a setup... why? They seemed so damn sincere. They'd have to, wouldn't they? Look, lady, you weren't there, okay? - Why were you? - I'm highly motivated... ow! That's enough. I'll tell you why I went up there. Because my kid and my ex-wife and all the people in their damn town are up there! And they got my partner up there, too. And God knows what they did to him. You call me a sympathizer? Kid, I ought to take those bandages and shove them right down your throat. I guess we should believe you. You seem so damn sincere. That's it. I wouldn't, Mr. Donovan. You see, we're also short on bandages. Look, you have to understand our point of view. You were among the first to board their ship. You worked in close proximity with them for quite some time. Three nights ago you met with Kristine Walsh. And now you're here, escaped from somewhere no one has escaped from, wearing... I know what I'm wearing. How'd you know about Kristine? Because I was there, outside. Now, you talk about a setup... Yeah. I know. I saw it. Why didn't you warn me? Because I didn't know whose side you were on. I'm on the right side, kid. Believe me. Well... Why don't you tell us what you know? I'd have to get my tape to show you, but that's pretty close. Reptilian. - Amazing. - No. No, not really. Listen, this could have happened right here on earth. What? Up to 60 million years ago, the reptiles ruled the earth, then... bam... a meteor, a big one, punched a hole right through the crust, that sent up dust, heat... - Iridium. - That's right... iridium. Iridium was in that meteor. It kept out the light, kept in the heat, kind of like a greenhouse effect. As the temperatures went up, the biggest, the smartest reptiles, who weren't equipped to handle the heat... like mammals are... Simply died. So what are you saying, man, all we gotta do is just turn up our barbecues, and... poof... Kentucky fried horny toad, huh? Extra crispy. It's not gonna be that easy, but yeah. Heat can be effective as a weapon. Cold sure ain't. The visitor who saved me took over 300 degrees below. Right. They're equipped to handle cold. Light. Bright light might be a weapon. The eating scene that you described would seem consistent with the biochemistry of reptiles as we know them. Yes. Live food or just-killed animals. What about the poison spray? It's not unusual for reptiles on earth to spray their venom just like that. Yeah, and from the symptoms you described, I'd say it's neurotoxic. That it attacks the nervous system. And that would cause your heart to flutter and your lungs to be affected. Can you make an antidote? Well, it's, um, it's possible. Procedures for creating an antivenom are pretty standard, but we need a quantity of venom. - Let's add that to the shopping list. - Sure. Oh, God... It's just so much. You know what we ought to do? We ought to define our overall plan of resistance. Right. - Yeah. - I agree with that. That makes sense. Yeah. Well, how about this? Um, firstly, to undermine all visitor activity. - Sure. - Impede their progress every way that we can. And then secondly, I think we should find out what their hidden goals are. Hidden? Sure. They've lied to us before. Yeah, and even brainwashed quite a few of us with that conversion process you described. I think it's safe to figure that there's something deeper still going on. And thirdly, we have to find out more about their physicality, we've got to find their weaknesses. And let people know about their true reptilian nature. - That tape is very important. - Yeah, I'm hip. The more people know about how alien they are... The more they'll want to fight against them. - I hear that. - And last and probably the most important... That we establish contact with others like us. Sure as hell they're there in every city all around the world. Right. We have to organize coordinated efforts. That's the only way that we stand a chance of winning. - Right. - Yeah. Robin. Robin? Now, let's make a list of targets to consider. Robin? Robin? Robin. Hold it. Against the wall. You're out after curfew, buddy. Another Maxwell. So... Ah, Brian. Good to see you. We'll talk more later, Kristine. - I need your help. - Of course. It's come to my attention that you've developed a relationship... With this young lady. Well, I know her, but... Is she attractive to you? Not like you are. I see now how you've risen through the ranks so quickly. I'm quite serious. That's very interesting... Because I've had my eye on you for quite some time. How can I be of service? Presently... I want your help with an experiment. Medical experiment. Unusual. Involving you... And her. Please, just tell me where my daughter is. Where is she? - She's our prisoner. - In here? No. The mothership. Is she alright? I'm told that will depend on you. What? There's some information we need. We think perhaps you can help us. I don't know anything. A camp in the mountains. No. I've never heard... We know of its existence. We need to find its location. I can't do anything about it. I... That's too bad. I'm awfully sorry for your daughter. No! Wait. My wife, my other daughters are up there. In the mountains? Yes. Yes. In the camp. I can't. Oh, dear God. Come with me. I think I can help you. I understand your anguish and your dilemma. I have children, too. Suppose I guarantee you that the camp will not be taken until a certain time? That would enable you to get them out beforehand. You'd do that? I would. But if you warn the others, Robin would be quite severely... No. No. No, I won't. But... Can your people take the camp without... Hey. It can be done quite easily without harm being brought to anyone. We won't get there until... What, 4:00 tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. Okay. You have my promise... As a father. I'll get the maps. Brian! Oh... Just take it easy. It's okay. - It's okay. - What'll they do to me? - I won't let anybody hurt you. - I wanna go home. I want to go home. I got to hand it to you, doc. You really pulled this bunch together. You sure juiced them up. I'll tell you something else, though. You better save some for yourself. Thanks. Okay, everybody, one last time. We all know our assignments, then. Diversionary action to start at 1:00? They'll know we're there. Okay. - 00, then, followed by our main assault against the armory at 2:00. We've got to keep in mind that our prime objective... - Is to rip off as many weapons as we can get our hands on. - Right. We have to arm ourselves so we'll be able to protect all of our equipment when we bring it down from the mountain camp. Uh, listen... While you're breaking loose all hell down here, I'm going to infiltrate the mothership and try to... Try to find your family? Hopefully. But also to try to get a handle on their plans. That's pretty suicidal, isn't it? Well, my partner always said I should have been a kamikaze pilot, and he's still up there somewhere. We'd, uh... Hate to lose you, Mr. Donovan. I'd hate to lose me, too. Good luck. To all of us. Let's do it. Wait, Juliet. How about a prayer? How about it, Caleb? Well, I thought that you would... Alright. Well, lord... We really need your help on this one. Please, help each and every one of us to do the best we can. A lot of people are depending on us. That's all. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Let's do it. That's 12:30. - I know it, brother. - Hurry up. Look, man. I ain't never messed with stuff like this before, and I'd just as soon not get my hands blowed off, okay? Now, let's go set the others. Oh... Oh, boy, I hate when people do that. Boy, I'd like to stick it in their hair. Hey, hold on. Wait for me. Willy! Willy! What? Alright, right away. Back on board, everybody. There's trouble at the plant. Come on. What's the problem? This one's for Abraham. Alright, stand back. Get some extinguishers! Isolated incidents of violence, mostly explosions at visitor or Police installations, are being reported all across Los Angeles. They may be part of a coordinated effort by the scientific conspiracy... My hands are really sweating. Are you scared, too? I just hope there aren't any casualties. I'd hate to lose one of us. Hang on! Watch out for the stakes in the road! Ooh-whee! Guns…and ammunition. Check it out. Let's get it loaded first. Julie! - I've gotta warn the camp. They're gonna be attacked. - What? Robin's a prisoner. I was trying to protect her. But too many other lives at stake. Robert! Donovan? I wanna know what's going on. Those tanks down in the hold. You've been there? Yeah. They're full of water. Where's the chemical you guys are making? There's no chemical. What the hell are... Oh, my God. That chemical's just a smoke screen, isn't it? That isn't what you want at all. You're right. You're here to take the water. It's the rarest, most valuable commodity you can imagine. Unlike most planets... Ours included... Earth is blessed with an abundance of it. We need it, Mike, for our sustenance and to power fusion generators and the leaders' weapons. - We could have shared it. - Some of us proposed that... But our leader wants it all. Other ships like this one are already on their way. The plan will take a generation, but he'll have his way. And the earth will become a desert, and humanity will die. No. There won't be any people left by then. There's something else I have to show you. Look, um... I'm sorry about the, uh... Where's grandpa? We never saw him. What happened to your arm? I burned it. What is this? They're your people. Dead? No. Just this side of death. Metabolism slowed extraordinarily. Diana's... Work. The people who disappeared... My son... Is he in here somewhere? Or in another ship like this one. Why are they being taken, stored like this? Why not just killed? The leader needs them living. Some of them will be made into troops for battles with his enemy. What enemy? The force that has defeated him before. His enemy? That makes them our friends, right? - I don't know... - Well, it's something to go on. You said some of them would be his troops... Not all. - No. - What about the others? In addition to the water... There's another basic shortage on our planet. Food. How'd someone like that get to be your leader anyway? Charisma, circumstances, promises. Not enough of us spoke out to question him until it was too late. It happens on your planet, doesn't it? I guess it does. How's Barbara? She's recovering. Look, Mike, this won't be pleasant for you. - Are you sure you... - Yeah... I'm sure. Tony. God. Diana? Yes. She's authorized some... Medical experiments. I want to kill her. You're not alone. Who are you? A friend. They... they tried to make me talk, but my grandfather... He fought... Fought with zapata. I tell them nothing. I spit in their faces. - Where'd your friend go? - He said there's a hostage being used to make her father spy on us. Here he comes. Get on board quick. Don't have time to explain, just get on. Let's go. You're coming, too? - Well, I can't stay here. - You ought to. - But, Mike.. - You'd be more valuable to us here. But I've gotta fly this for you. I'm a pilot. I've ridden in enough of these things to try. - But listen, Mike... - Martin. Say it, man. You're scared. Yeah. It's very, very dangerous for me here now. What does he look like, a Sunday afternoon at Disneyland? I'm sure Barbara was scared, and Tony, too. Hell, man, we're all scared, every last damn one of us. But we've got to help in the best way we can. Now, how about it, man? Are you game? You'll have a tendency to overcompensate, Mike. The controls are very, very sensitive. If you let it, Mike, it will almost fly itself. I hope so. Hey. I'm proud to have you as a friend. I hope we live to be old friends. Hey! Hold it! Hang on. Get another fighter and follow me! They may not kill us, but my driving might. Pull up. I'm working on it. Aah! Alright. Let them have it, Cisco. Sancho. Well done, captain... Their mountain camp. This should give your troops a little exercise. It's not 4:00! They lied! They lied to me! Billy, get over here! Kathleen! Polly! Come on, Sancho. Nail that sucker. I will, I will, but I need a little luck. We're gonna hit the mountain. Not with any luck. Where'd you learn how to fly? No! No! My eyes! Kathleen! Move back! Move back! Bring them over here! We got to stop them! Alright! Get them out! Come on! We got to save all the equipment in that building, okay? Come on! Get them out! Get them out! Hurry up! Come on! Come on! Yeah! Alright! Look out. Here they come again. Yeah! Alright! Come on! Hurry up! Julie! Julie! Help me. Do something. Help. Do something, please. What should I do? What should I do? Do something. Julie! Another pass. I want to get that woman. Return to base. Right away. All units return to base. Kath! Kath! Kathleen. Oh, God. This wasn't going to happen, not to anyone. I tried to fight them. Where are the girls? Daddy! Mama! - We fought good, huh? - Yeah, we fought good. Mr. Donovan. It's good to see you. Yeah... You, too. So, what did you find out? Ben, we did it. We saved all the equipment in here. Did you see them turn and run? How about this lady here, right in the middle of all of it, huh? - Shoot, man, they ain't so tough. - Huh? They ain't so tough. What, are you crazy? Well, from what you said, sounds like we'd better focus our attention on destroying as many of the motherships as possible. Destroying? I don't think you get the picture, doc. There are people up there. Thousands of them. Our people. Yes, I understand... Elias, get the trucks out... And we'll try to save as many of those people as possible. - Try? - Yes, try! Damn it, Donovan, you've got to understand that we may have to sacrifice those thousands to save millions, even billions. Look... Look, I don't like it any more than you do. I hate it. My life has been devoted to saving lives, but we may not have a choice. Brad, help me get the equipment out. Elias, get the other trucks going. Get the ammunition out first, then the biomedical equipment. Well, it's not the holiday inn, but it's gonna have to do. You sound like mom. Guess I'm going to have to, huh? Do you still feel sick? Not like this morning. Every morning for the past three days in a row. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Was it really scary up in that spaceship? Yeah, it was really scary. But it was also... Very interesting. Okay, everybody, go brush your teeth. You sound like mom, alright. Really, Michael. That's the most outrageous story I've ever heard. Listen. Whether you believe it or you don't, the truth is, my son... your grandson... And 10,000 other people are prisoners aboard those big ships of your friends. Now, good God, don't tell me you're unaware of what went on around this town all week long. Of course I'm aware. I'm not a fool. - Then why... - I'm a survivor, Michael. Otherwise, I never would've gotten here from that Louisiana hick town where I started otherwise I would have never made it through your father's drunkenness. It's not the same thing. I'm a survivor, and if you are going to be, you'd better change your ways. I know the visitors aren't saints, but they're in power. They are power. You and I are in unique positions. Don't you see that? Why not take advantage... Because I can't survive at the expense of other people. It's not right. You know, when I was a kid... There was a woman who taught me what was right and what was wrong. I wonder whatever became of her. Halt! I said halt! - Why have you come here? - Please, I have to talk to you. You have to leave. Our son may be here at any minute. You understand? He's... Yes, I know, but the resistance needs your help. What? We want this to be a safe house where some of us can come and hide occasionally. You're out of your mind. We've already been arrested once. Look how he's suffered. They tortured him. And our son is an informer. Yes and all of that is why this is an ideal place. The lightning struck here once already. Believe me, they won't look here again. We can't. The only reason they let us go was so that we would warn others of what could happen. - The next time, they might kill us. - They killed Kathleen. We've got to stop them. I decided that it would be alright for me to die, myself, if millions... Millions could be saved. Oh, please. My God, we need your help. We can't. I'm truly sorry. We can't. We simply can't. What's this? My father left it for us. Read it. Read it to him. "My dear family, it's painful knowing that I'll not see your faces anymore." "But I must take this stand for what I know is right." "You may think that an old man wouldn't be afraid to die, but this old man's very frightened." "I'm hoping that I'll find" "a little of your mother's dignity and strength." "So far, I'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark." "But we must fight this darkness" "that is threatening to engulf us." "Each of us must be a ray of hope and do our part" "and join with the others till we've become a blinding light..." "Triumphant over darkness." "Until that task is accomplished, life will have no meaning." "More than anything, you must remember always which side you're on and fight for it." "Your mother and I will march beside you..." "Holding hands again..." "We'll sing your song of victory. You'll feel us in your hearts..." "Our spirit..." Our spirits will be with you always and our love. We have to help. Or else we won't have learned a thing. Yes. Okay, Kenny, start it now. So that's a call for help? Yep. A mathematical code. If the visitors do have an enemy, they ought to be intelligent enough to translate this. How long do you think it'll take to reach them? It depends how far away they are. A few years, probably. - God. Years? - Uh-huh. And we're going to keep on transmitting day and night. - Right, Kenny? - Right. Hope they got their ghetto blasters tuned in on us. If they do, let's hope they're on our side. So what, we hang in there for a couple more years, right? But the reality we have to face is that help may never come. We may end up having to rely completely on ourselves. So? We've done alright. The first battle's been won, right? That's right, but the war is just beginning.
