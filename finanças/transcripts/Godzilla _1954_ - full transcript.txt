DISTRESS FREQUENCY Yes? South Seas Salvage. Ogata speaking. What's that? Right, I see. I'll be right there. Emiko, I'm sorry. What is it? An accident? An SOS from one of our boats. I have to go to the Coast Guard office. BUDAPEST STRING QUARTET I'm sorry I can't go, but you can make it if you hurry. That's disappointing, but work is work. You'd better hurry. The Eiko-maru... a 7,500-ton freighter belonging to South Seas Shipping, lost contact on August 13 at 19:05 hours, latitude 24° north, longitude 141.2° east. Cause of loss of communication unknown. Patrol vessels in Regions 3 and 4, stand by to deploy. Thank you. Thank you for your efforts. What could have caused this? We don't know. It was like when the Myojin-sho volcano erupted: We received an SOS, then suddenly the connection went dead. The Bingo-maru is approaching the area. They're sure to find something. Right here. Right, the same location. The Eiko-maru and Bingo-maru. Both are freighters owned by South Seas. Yes. Cause unknown. You have no idea if there are any survivors? We won't until morning. A helicopter and two ships are heading there now. We can't say anything until we receive their report. Why not send more ships? Two aren't enough! We aren't limiting the search party to two ships. Rest assured that we'll devote all our resources to the search. Help! We're here! Hang on! I'm telling you, the sea just exploded! Exploded? Three survivors were rescued by a fishing boat and are being taken to Odo Island. We're dispatching a patrol boat to get them. Are they from the Eiko-maru or the Bingo-maru? We're still investigating. We'll release the names soon. Thank goodness at least three survived. They'll help us figure out what caused this. Reports are coming in! Just a moment, please. What is it? This is incredible. Utterly incredible. The fishing boat has met the same fate. Give me the news desk. Mr. Yamane? The fishing boat sank too. That's three now. Yes, in the same location. Tell us what you know! - What happened to the fishing boat? - Did it send a signal? We'll make an announcement soon. Please be patient! NAVAL MINES? UNDERSEA VOLCANO? SHIPS SINK MYSTERIOUSLY AT SEA NO HOPE OF SURVIVORS No matter how you slice it, this is serious. Look, something's floating in! It's a raft! A raft's coming in! A raft's coming in! A raft's coming in! Build up the fire. It's Masaji! Masaji! Masaji, hang on! Brother! Masaji! - It got us, - What? and our boat too. Masaji, what did this? No luck. Not even small fry. It's never been this bad. I knew it. It must be Godzilla. Godzilla again, pops? There's no such thing nowadays. If you ridicule our traditions... I'll feed you stupid cows to Godzilla! There's definitely some living thing goin' crazy down there. That's why we can't catch a thing. But a creature that big - That's why I didn't wanna say anything! I'm tellin' the truth, but nobody believes me. Shinkichi, let's go. Hey! Godzilla? That's right. A giant, terrifying monster. Once he eats all the fish in the sea, he'll come ashore and eat people. In the old days, if the catch was poor for a long time, we'd offer up a young girl... and send her drifting out into the middle of the ocean. This dance is all that's left of that sacrificial ritual. Godzilla, huh? Shinkichi! Don't go out there! Brother! Masaji! Mama! Shinkichi, what is it? ODO ISLAND DISASTER PETITION GROUP Representative Oyama. You report 17 houses destroyed and 9 people dead. The next entry is livestock. Could you itemize those losses? Mr. Inada, headman for Odo Island. Oh, I forgot about that. We lost 12 cows and 8 pigs. It's the truth. It was hard to see in the dark, but it was definitely alive. I know it defies common sense, but the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced this wasn't caused by a typhoon. The damage to the houses and helicopter suggests they were crushed from above. To conclude, we'll hear the testimony of paleontologist Professor Kyohei Yamane. I'm a bit embarrassed to be testifying before I've had a chance to inspect the disaster scene. But as you're all aware, footprints thought to belong to a “snowman” have been discovered in the Himalayas, and that mystery has yet to be solved. Furthermore, there are sealed cavities deep in the ocean. We can't imagine what secrets they conceal. I believe we must form an emergency research team to investigate the matter. RESEARCH VESSEL TO ODO ISLAND Good-bye! See you soon! Be careful! I'm surprised Serizawa came to see us off. He rarely leaves his lab. Perhaps it was a final farewell. What do you mean? Of course we'll avoid dangerous waters, but anything could happen. Don't use this well for now. It's dangerous. What are we supposed to do? Professor... if there were radioactive fallout, wells on the other side of the island would be affected too. That's right. So why are we only picking up radiation here? It doesn't make any sense. Mr. Hagiwara... if I told you this was the footprint of a giant creature, would you believe me? Really, Professor? This footprint is radioactive. It's dangerous here, folks. Please stay back! Step back! Emiko, look. It's a trilobite, a three-lobed marine arthropod thought long extinct. Professor, you shouldn't handle that with bare hands. Professor, what is that thing? It's an amazing discovery. Godzilla's on the other side of Hachiman Hill! Father! What is it? Professor Tanabe... I saw it! A creature from the Jurassic era! Where? Father! Ogata! This way! Over here! What is it? - What's that? - Footprints! Approximately two million years ago, the brontosaurus... and other dinosaurs were at their peak. Scientists call this the Jurassic period. It's believed that during the following geological period, the Cretaceous period, a rare intermediate organism was evolving... from a marine reptile into a terrestrial animal. Following Odo Island tradition, I propose for the time being... that we call this creature Godzilla. We encountered Godzilla on Odo Island. This is a photo of his head. We can estimate that he stands approximately 165 feet tall. Why such a creature would appear in our territorial waters is the next question. He was probably hidden away in a deep sea cave, providing for his own survival, and perhaps for others like it. However, repeated underwater H-bomb tests... have completely destroyed his natural habitat. To put it simply, hydrogen-bomb testing has driven him from his sanctuary. - This is horrible! - Indeed. There is physical evidence to support this theory. First, the trilobite found in Godzilla's footprint. In Japanese we also call it the “three-lobed arthropod.” Here it is. It too is believed to have gone extinct two million years ago. It belongs to the crustacean family. The second piece of evidence is sand recovered from the trilobite's shell. There's no doubt that this sand is from one of the Jurassic Era strata. It's the same sand found in the red clay of those strata. Professor, how can you know H-bombs are to blame? Because Geiger counter readings of the sand indicate the presence of strontium-90. Professor Tanabe will explain more about that in a moment... but in brief... we discovered high levels of radiation of the kind produced only by H-bombs in this sand from Godzilla's body. Order, please! This physical evidence allows us to conclude that Godzilla is emitting high levels of H-bomb radiation. Order, please! Chairman! Representative Oyama. Given the grave repercussions of Professor Yamane's report, we mustn't rush to make this public. That's exactly why it must be made public! That's right! Quiet! What I mean is... if this Godzilla thing is the result of H-bomb tests - It is! That's exactly what it is! That's my point. Make this public and our fragile diplomatic relations will be further strained. The truth is the truth! That's what makes it so serious! If we announce this too rashly, the public will panic. Our political life, economy, and foreign relations will be plunged into chaos! You fool! What are you saying? - How dare you! - Apologize! The truth must be made public! DISASTER RESPONSE CENTER ESTABLISHED HEAVY LOSSES AT SEA: 17 SHIPS SUNK TO DATE This is awful. Atomic tuna, radioactive fallout, and now this Godzilla to top it off! What if he shows up in Tokyo Bay? He'll probably go straight for you first. You're horrible! I barely escaped the atomic bomb in Nagasaki - and now this! I'll have to find a place to evacuate to. Find me one too. Evacuate again? I've had enough! DISASTER RESPONSE CENTER We're in deep-sea fishing. We can't do business without ships. Longitude 138° to 138.7° east. Latitude 33.4° ... to 33.8° north. The frigate squadron will attack Godzilla in that range with depth charges. All vessels in that vicinity should exercise caution. - End of statement. - That's it? That's all. TV NEWS With nearly 20 ships sunk so far, Godzilla, monster of the century, has all of Japan in a panic. The frigate squadron has begun its depth-charge attack. The 10-vessel fleet left port at 10:00 a.m., headed for the west coast of Odo Island. At 10:17 they received orders to commence attack. Is something wrong? The professor's a zoologist. He doesn't want to see Godzilla killed. Father. Father. Please leave me alone for a while. Emiko... please turn off the light. Yes. It's Godzilla! Don't panic, please! - This is bad. - Who'll compensate us for damages? We're getting nowhere. We'll starve waiting here like this. They have to do something. What a mess. Please have a seat. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Not at all. Professor, we're really at a loss. If this continues, we'll soon have to close our international shipping lanes. Do you have any ideas? Even the slightest hint would help. Indeed... Professor Yamane, I'll be blunt: We want to know if there's a way to kill Godzilla. Impossible. Godzilla was baptized in the fire of the H-bomb and survived. What could kill him now? Right now our priority should be to study his incredible powers of survival. Hot off the press. Professor Yamane makes many important points. It's pathetic to quake in fear. We should be studying Godzilla! Yes, but at what cost? That's right. It's a tough question. Hagiwara... go interview this guy on the double. Dr. Serizawa? Professor Yamane's future son-in-law. The girl's fiancé? I'm sure Father will understand. We have nothing to be ashamed of... but when I think about Serizawa, I lose my nerve. If not for the war, he wouldn't have lost his eye. Ogata... I've thought of him as an older brother ever since I was a child. I still feel the same way today. Emiko... thank you. Miss Emiko, Mr. Hagiwara's here to see you. Mr. Hagiwara? Yeah, the reporter. Hello there. Pardon the intrusion. Thanks. - What is it? - I have a favor to ask. I tried to see Dr. Serizawa, but he politely refused. I was hoping you might introduce me. I can explain later, but it's really urgent. I'd be very much obliged. This is good timing. I can go along and explain things to Serizawa personally. I suppose... but I think it would be better if he heard it from me. It'll be easier on him. You're right. Then you go ahead. Thank you. We should go. The car's waiting. I'll try to break it to him gently. I'll be discussing Shinkichi's schooling with your father at your place. SERIZAWA RESEARCH LABORATORY There must be some mistake. That's not what my research is about at all. The thing is... our correspondent in Switzerland heard from a German scientist that when the plan you're working on is finished, it'll be a major breakthrough in defeating Godzilla. I don't know any German scientists. I see. What exactly are you working on right now? It isn't worth discussing. Then forgive me for disturbing you. - Sorry I couldn't be more help. - If you'll excuse me. - I'm going to stay a while. - Then I'll be going. I hoped to at least find out what he's working on. He can be moody... but you've broken the ice, so keep trying. I'll do that. Good-bye. Thank you for coming. Just what is it you're working on? Father's been wondering too. “What's Serizawa up to these days?” Emiko, shall I show you? What? All right. But you mustn't tell a soul. I'm risking my life on this project. You swear to keep it secret? Follow me. Oh my! Get back! Emiko... you're the only person I'd show this to. Don't forget that. I won't. I swear I'll keep it a secret. Good evening. You've had a long day. Did something happen? No... nothing at all. - Is Emiko back? - Right here! It's Godzilla! Godzilla's coming! Ogata! I didn't get a chance to tell Serizawa about us. I'm Professor Yamane! I can't let you pass. I can't guarantee your safety. Then tell your CO not to shine searchlights on Godzilla. - They'll only make him angrier! - I can't leave my post. Professor, let's go up on that hill. Please stay back! RESEARCH TEAMS ARRIVE FROM AROUND THE WORLD First we'll erect a barbed-wire barrier all along the coast 100 feet high and 165 feet deep. We'll send 50,000 volts through it to electrocute Godzilla. Of course we'll have to evacuate not only outside the perimeter but also everyone living within 1,600 feet of the inside of the barrier. The Defense Forces and Coast Guard will carry out their respective duties outlined in this security plan without delay. This is an announcement from Security Command. At 16:30 hours, Godzilla was sighted at sea 15 miles northeast of Kannonzaki, heading northwest. A maximum-security alert has been issued for coastal areas between Tokyo and Yokohama. Sector 1. Check. Sector 3. Check. This is a special news report. All residents of Minato, Shinagawa, and Ota wards have been ordered to evacuate. We repeat... All residents of Minato, Shinagawa, and Ota wards have been ordered to evacuate. Please stay tuned for further reports. Emiko... I'm going to ask for your father's consent today... all right? Welcome home. Father, what's wrong? All they can think of is killing Godzilla. Why don't they try to study his resistance to radiation? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Professor, I disagree. Ogata, I'm not saying this on some kind of whim. No scientist in the world has ever seen anything like Godzilla. It's a priceless specimen, found only in Japan. But Professor... that's no reason to let such a violent monster run loose. Godzilla's no different from the H-bomb still hanging over Japan's head. Then shouldn't we unlock the secret of how he survived exposure to such high radiation? But - So you want to kill him too? Get out. Get out of my house! I'm sorry. No, I wasn't very tactful. No, something's come over Father. Emiko... I'll find the right moment to talk to him about us. This is a special news bulletin. Godzilla continues to advance toward the Tokyo- Yokohama coast. The security barrier is charged with high-voltage electricity. Please exercise extreme caution. Heading: 25° to 30°! Distance: 2,800 feet! Fires are raging out of control in the Shibaura district. Headquarters calling Car 467. Come in, please. Headquarters, this is Car 467. The fire in Mitadai has spread and is headed for Isarago. This is Headquarters calling Car 215. Come in. Car 215 reporting. Defenses at Fudanotsuji have been breached. The 49th Armored Division was destroyed. Further action impossible. Any message to relay? Attention, all radio cars. Initiate Security Command Code 129! Abandon attack formations. Focus all efforts on fighting fires and rescuing casualties. Over. Initiate Security Command Code 129! Take cover! We're going to join Daddy! We'll be where Daddy is soon! This is absolutely unbelievable, yet it's unfolding before our very eyes! Godzilla's leaving a sea of flames in his wake! Owari-Cho, Shinbashi, Tamachi, Shiba, Shibaura - all a sea of flames! Godzilla's on the move! He appears headed for Sukiyabashi. For those watching at home, this is no play or movie. This is real, the story of the century! Will the world be destroyed by a two-million-year-old monster? All personnel to the underground shelter! Quickly, please! Operational command staff, proceed to Shelter 306! We're reporting live via shortwave transmitter. Godzilla is headed this way, right for our TV tower! There's no time to run. Will we survive? He's getting closer! This looks like the end! He has the tower in his hand. What power! This really is the end. Farewell, ladies and gentlemen! Godzilla has turned central Tokyo into a sea of flames. He's proceeding from Ueno to Asakusa, possibly heading for the sea. Damned beast! Damned beast! Damned beast! He's running away! He'll be back! What can we do? Damn it! How can we kill the bastard? Godzilla seems to have retreated to the sea for now. A research team headed by Professor Yamane has been formed to find countermeasures. Those are the top stories at this hour. Mr. Ogata of South Seas Salvage... the patrol boat's departure time has been changed. Please report to the briefing room. Thank you for your help. Your mommy will be back soon. Emiko... Ogata, there's something important I must tell you. I can't keep quiet anymore! I can break my promise now with a clean conscience. Your promise? Yes. I made a promise to Serizawa. Serizawa? I kept it secret even from you... but now I have to break my promise. It was the day Mr. Hagiwara and I went to see him. That's when it happened. Get back! Did you... That's right. I destroyed all the oxygen in the water. All the organisms in the tank suffocated. Their remains were then liquefied by my Oxygen Destroyer. It splits oxygen atoms into fluid. My... I'd intended to research oxygen thoroughly from every angle. In doing so... I discovered an unexpected form of energy. After my first experiment... I was filled with horror at the power I'd unleashed. I couldn't eat for days. Just a small ball of this substance... could turn all of Tokyo Bay... into an aquatic graveyard. But why develop such a thing? Emiko... my research is strictly in the interest of science. But what if your discovery is used for some awful purpose? Exactly. If used as a weapon... it could lead humanity to extinction, just like the H-bomb. But I'm determined to find a use for the Oxygen Destroyer... that will benefit society. Until then, I won't reveal its existence. That's why I told that reporter nothing. Should anyone try to force me to use it before then... I'm willing to give up my life... and destroy my work rather than let that happen. I understand. I won't say a word... even to Father. Now I've broken that promise. I see. But Emiko... you did it to save us from utter disaster. I'm sure he'll forgive you. Ah, welcome. Serizawa. What's this? You're here too? I have a big favor to ask. Have a seat. What kind of favor? I want to use the Oxygen Destroyer. What Oxygen Destroyer? I don't know what you're talking about! Serizawa, why keep up this pretense? Pretense? Serizawa, I broke my promise. I told him everything! Please let him use it! I'm sorry! Please forgive me! Emiko couldn't bear the sight of all that destruction. Please try to forgive her. You're our only hope. Ogata... if Emiko told you my secret, you must understand why I can't let you use it. I refuse! - Serizawa! - No. - Even to battle Godzilla? - Please leave now. Serizawa! Open the door! Serizawa! What are you doing? Leave me alone! Let go! - You'd destroy years of research? - Let go! Stop it, please! Ogata! Ogata! Ogata, please forgive me. If it could be put to good use, I'd be the first to reveal it to the world. But right now... it's nothing but a weapon of mass destruction. Please understand! I do understand. But if we don't stop Godzilla now... what's to become of us? Ogata... if the Oxygen Destroyer is used even once, the politicians of the world won't stand idly by. They'll inevitably turn it into a weapon. A-bombs against A-bombs, H-bombs against H-bombs - as a scientist - no, as a human being - adding another terrifying weapon to humanity's arsenal is something I can't allow. Then what do we do about the horror facing us now? Just let it happen? Only you can save us from this tragedy. Even if you use it to defeat Godzilla, how can it be used as a weapon if you don't publish your research? Ogata, we human beings are weak creatures. Even if I burn my notes, everything's still in my head. As long as I'm alive, who can say I wouldn't be coerced into using it again? If only I'd never invented it! “O peace, O light, hasten back to us” - that's the prayer for peace being offered up nationwide today. We're broadcasting one such scene from Tokyo. Listen to these young girls as they sing from their hearts. Hasten back to us Our hearts are filled with prayer This we pray Hear our song And have pity on us O peace! O light! Hasten back to us! Serizawa! Ogata, you two win. But this will be the first and last time I ever allow... the Oxygen Destroyer to be used. It's all right, Emiko. This is the only way to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. The decisive moment draws near. We'll soon know if this monster terrorizing the world will be buried forever in the ocean's depths. A Geiger counter is being used to pinpoint Godzilla's location. Ogata... please get me a diving suit. What? You have no diving experience. Serizawa... Ogata's right. Don't be foolish. Professor, this is the only Oxygen Destroyer I have. To be fully effective, it must be released underwater. All right. We'll go down together. No, I can do it alone. You're crazy. I'm not letting a beginner go down there alone! Prepare another diving suit! Are we clear? You're to follow my instructions. The only batch of Oxygen Destroyer in the world: How much power does it possess? Its inventor, Dr. Serizawa, refuses to say. All we can do now is pray for its success. Professor... I never dreamed I'd unveil my discovery like this. I'll be praying for you. You two be very careful. Ogata, I'm counting on you. The attack begins. Dr. Serizawa is being slowly lowered into the water. They've reached bottom! - Stop! - Stop unspooling! Serizawa! Serizawa! What's going on? Ogata, it's working! I hope you two will be happy. Farewell! Serizawa! Bring him up! What emotion! What joy! Victory at last! I saw Godzilla's lifeless corpse sink into the sea with my own eyes! This victory belongs to young Dr. Serizawa, scientist of the century! He wished us happiness together. I can't believe that Godzilla... was the last of his species. If nuclear testing continues... then someday, somewhere in the world... another Godzilla may appear. Present, arms! Order, arms! THE END
