It's not going to stop raining. I think we'll have to spend the night here. What was that? -It was nothing. Please, Arturo! Relax. Leave me alone. Quit acting like a little girl. -I'm scared, Arturo, really scared! Be quiet! Don't be stupid! Let's go! Please, let's go! -Shut up! SCARED TO DEATH Quickly! Over here! Hurry! Subtitles: millorona Raise this hand up more. And your legs, a little lower. Bend this knee more -- like him. And you, raise your hands higher to protect your face. And you, put your guard up, and bend more at the knees. Put your hands straighter. Don't bend them. Martin? Take over, please. -Yes, sir. Mr. Ruben Gonzalez? At your service, sir. I'm Lieutenant Rami Rodriguez, Secret Service. Do you have family in Los Angeles? Yes, sir. Do you know Arturo... Harrison? No, sir. "Nadia Gonzalez?" -She's my daughter, sir. Arturo Harrison... ...was the boyfriend of... Nadia Gonzalez. Arturo was killed a couple of days ago, and your daughter has disappeared. What? And it doesn't look good. Your daughter is suspected... of murder. I'm sorry, Mr. Gonzalez. What took you so long? I've been waiting for you for many years. Where were you? Where were you? No, I don't believe you. This is another one of your jokes. No one can get lost in Paris. Besides, you're a woman of the world. You've been to Switzerland, Greece, Spain... Lies. Why don't you want to tell me the truth? You have a lover, don't you? I knew it! I knew it! That's why you left me. You left me blind, Beatriz. Blind! All this time has been like living in darkness. Like an eternal nightmare! It has been horrible, searching for you in the night! Beatriz! Beatriz! Forgive me, my love. What's important now is that you're here with me again... ...and forever. Forever, Beatriz! Stupid girl! You're not Beatriz! You've been tricking me! Bitch! Beatriz! Hello! -I waited for you... Here are the records you've been waiting for. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Nadia Gonzalez, 18 years old, high school student. No prior record. Disappeared last September 5th in Caliston, California. Her companion, Mr. Arturo Harrison... ...was found dead in an abandoned house. The homicide was apparently a crime of passion. What does Arturo Harrison's record say? Nothing important. It isn't important that he was involved in drug trafficking? That boy was arrested and was out on bail. That has nothing to do with this. Look, lieutenant... Harrison was the son of someone to whom you owe many favors... ...and he doesn't want his name mixed up in this. Cover up if you want... ...but don't implicate an innocent person! What's happening, any news? -Nothing. The lieutenant and his men are leaving today for Caliston... ...and I think things are going badly. But, it's been four days and we still don't know anything! I don't know... I can only imagine the worst. If you don't mind, I'd like to go to Caliston, myself. The lieutenant doesn't want me to get involved... ...but, we can't just do nothing. -No, of course not. I'll go with you, Ruben. I need to find out what's happened. Cooped up here, I'll go crazy! I don't know if that's best. Please, Ruben. In these situations, one never knows what could happen. Besides, we can't leave the kids. -They can come with us. Don't give in to despair. Let me take care of things on my own. Come forward. You too. You may sit down. Come forward... And you. Go back to your places. Thank you. Stand. I have to go to Caliston, tomorrow... ..on a personal matter, and I need some volunteers to go with me. You can count on us, master. I can't give a lot of explanation. I'll expect you tomorrow at noon, at the entrance of the town, at this address. Excuse the question. How long will we be there? I don't know. It could be hours... or days. Be discreet. Leave her alone! Get out of here now! Come in. Please, come in. Sit down. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. Very well. Proceed. I've come to speak with you for a few minutes. Go ahead. I'm Lt. Rodriguez, from the Division of Special Investigations. That doesn't interest me... Why did you come? I'm investigating the death of Arturo Harrison, the son of Judge John Harrison. And what does that have to do with your visit? John Harrison sentenced you to 12 years in prison. And now you think this is revenge, right? I have many reasons to believe so. Lieutenant, my friend, you're thinking this over too much. Let's get to the point. Look, Nestor, the only thing I care about is that Judge Harrison... ...does not appear to be involved with the Mafia. Can you explain? Clearly. It's in no judge's best interest that his son be involved with drugs, and if the son's dead, maybe he died in a car accident... ...well, there are many ways to die, no? The boy's girlfriend... disappeared. I don't care if she's six feet under. If she's alive, she could cause me much harm. And what would happen if she was dead? We could invent a nice little love story. And if she was... ...alive? The dead don't talk, sir. To your health, lieutenant! You shouldn't have brought your son, Martin. I'm intrigued, why are you being so careful? It's time to go, we're very close. Let's go. We're going to stay here a little while longer. I prefer it if we all go together. Don't worry, we're big enough to take care of ourselves. "As you wish." Caliston is half a mile away. -We'll meet you in two hours. Don't be afraid, dear. Nothing's going to happen to you. That's why I'm here. To take care of you, protect you. That damn policeman will never find you. Never! Do you know why? Because he's going to die! Neither he nor anyone else will ever separate us. Never! He wants to kill you! He wants to make me suffer! But not anymore. That's over! You and I... You and I will be together forever. So many years of waiting, so that that damned idiot can tear us apart? No! That's it! I'm... I'm afraid. I'm really afraid. I wouldn't be able to live without you. Rene! Rene! Good evening. Do you have anything for about 8 people? It's 80 dollars. And can we see where we're going to stay the night? It's 80 dollars, take it or leave it. A couple with a kid will be coming, too. Hey! A question... We're looking for an abandoned house near the outskirts of town. In this town, there are lots of abandoned houses. They should be here by now. Someone must go look for them. Wait. First, I want to tell you something that's very serious. Five days ago, my daughter disappeared in this area, and I don't know if she's still alive. It could be dangerous out there, so I want you guys to be very careful. That's all I can tell you. How can we help you? I'm going out at midnight. If I'm not back by dawn, look for me. But I'd like it if you look for Martin and his family. Do you remember me, Mr. Gonzalez? -Yes, sir. Lieutenant Rodriguez. Can you give me a few minutes? I'm listening, lieutenant. You can talk in front of them. I'll be brief, Mr. Gonzalez. You may not stay another minute in Caliston. I'm not asking your permission, lieutenant. I want you to stop butting into my work. "I understand that you're trying to help," but you're only hindering me. I've come for my daughter, lieutenant, and I'll continue in spite of you, or anyone else. I will find her, and you, save your words and tend to your own business. I'll take care of mine. Be very careful, Mr. Gonzalez. Very careful. Excuse me for just a moment. Are you a cop? -I am. I don't want anything from you guys. I know where the place you are looking for is. What do you want in exchange? It's a half-mile walk west, behind the rocks. Martin! Lorena! Good! Where'd you get it? I don't care. Go on, go away! Go away! Hello? Hello? Who's calling, please? Hello? Hello? Hello? For God's sake, who's calling? Mickey. Why are you up at this hour? And dad? He went out, dear. Sleep, because you need to go to school, okay? Where am I? What are you doing here, you piece of... Imbecile, talk! Answer me! -You're a coward, Nestor! Enough! Leave him alone! This carrion is no longer good for anything except the creatures. Take him away! "I want you to listen carefully." "I won't repeat myself." "Come as quickly as possible to the outskirts of Caliston," "so that you may say farewell to your daughter." "Because I am taking her to Europe." "Come alone. Death does not like crowds." And Teddy's going to cause us problems, too. He's an idiot. Say the word, and we'll make him disappear. What's going on, Tom? Nestor, you and I have something very important to talk about. It will have to be another time, lieutenant. Right now I'm waiting for someone of great importance to me. To hell with your meeting! My people are disappearing. And you know very well what I'm talking about. I don't understand, lieutenant. Don't play with me, Nestor. You know very well that I'm not your enemy. Nevertheless... I believe there's someone here who doesn't like you, and who wants to harm you. You're referring to Ruben Gonzalez? I'll leave that for you to figure out. Who is it? The police! We're looking for Ruben Gonzalez. He's not here right now. Wait a minute. A man and woman from my unit have disappeared, and I'm the kind of guy who gets his payback... ...an eye for an eye... ...and a tooth for a tooth. Stay there. What are going to do to me? No, please! Tell me, who am I? Who am I? Are you Mrs. Gonzalez? Why have you come with your children? This is a very dangerous place. Where is Nadia? Follow me, please. Please, sit down. Many years ago, I had a wonderful wife. Beatriz. Your daughter looks extraordinarily like her. Truly extraordinary. A faithful copy. I didn't come all the way here to waste time, sir. Of course not. My wife is sleeping. I'll go upstairs and announce your arrival. Do you know where my husband is? "Naturally, I do, my dear madam. I know everything!" But, I recommend that you have a bit of patience. You can't remain in this house a second longer. Beatriz has just come home, and she knows everything. She knows you're my lover! She's come with two children. She says they're mine! Now... now I'll resolve the problem I have with that harlot! It's a question of honor. You understand, don't you, my love? Welcome! Good evening! Ruben! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Ruben! Cynthia! You're going to die! You're going to die. It ends here, Ruben. Father! Mickey! Mother! Let me go! Let me go! Mickey! This way, father. I never desired anyone so much, my precious one. Never. Now, no one can separate us. Stop! Mother! Ruben! -It's going to be alright, now. Kids! My daughter! No! "One moment, sir!" Yes, what do you have to say? I witnessed what happened... "...and to the shady things you all have been fabricating..." "...in order to hide the truth." My name is Susan Fiero, and I'm a reporter for the International News. At this very moment, the news of what has truly happened here... ...is circulating in this country's most important newspapers.
