Ladies and gentlemen Let's welcome both our players into the venue Jimmy White is quite calm over there - And extraordinarily dignified, too - Right Chow Siu Lung looks a bit nervous Maybe his competition experience isn't enough I think so Stop this or I'll beat you Stand properly Master Chow, We'll count you in for the party later I have a celebration in Tai O too Idiot! This event's going to be held very soon Do you think Chow Siu Lung will win? I've played snooker with him His skill is considered to be unfathomable If he can do his best he stands a chance - I hope he really does - Right Alright, we're now going to watch the match Can Chow Siu Lung clear the red ball? The shot's not strong enough indeed. Do you think he's really nervous? Hasn't warmed up... Jimmy White has been too careless this time Right, I think he shows contempt for his rival Chow Siu Lung has a chance to clear the red ball this time That's right. I think he's confident in clearing this ball Lung“. In... Boss, we'll make it this time Boss, that peasant is losing The chance of clearing this ball is almost the same as that of the previous one There's no reason for Chow Siu Lung to lose this chance again Go away bumpkin. Go back to Tai O. Get out of here! Sorry, I want to get some water You're scared? Lung, what's happened? God-brother, maybe there was too much pressure Maybe there's too much pressure - What's up? - Who knows? What's up? You've stopped suddenly I can't gamble And we're betting on so much land. I can't... Just pretend it's a piece of paper Lung, have confidence I have no confidence I can't go on Chin up, you can do this Persevere, you can do it Lung, have confidence You can do it - It's very touching - Right Many people are encouraging Chow Siu Lung Come on, Chow Siu Lung! You can't do it go back to your village What did you say? Hit him Stop, he's seriously injured now Why must you beat him? Just hit his foul mouth It's enough too bad Thanks I must try hard for everybody Boss, I've taken care of him Terrific What is it? For the ancestors Thanks Mo I've made it Thanks to everyone Hey, it's not finished Peasant It's not over yet Quick, end this Yeah Not over yet? I forgot we have to go on Do you? It's a tough shot, how'd you do it? You're certainly getting your confidence back, right? Got it Damn Made it Damn, failed again Seventh round, the tie-breaker Chow Siu Lung lags three shots behind There're still 3 balls on the table That's right. Only if he can clear the blue ball He can take the lead with two points It's done Lung, just get the pink one and you win It's done Pop the champagne! This won't go in You got a plan? This one isn't going in... Don't let it go in Thanks You've guessed it Super powers You know it? I learnt it from a movie Aiya, Chow Siu Lung is really unlucky He's let Jimmy White set the shot It's quite difficult for him to clear this ball The white is completely blocked by the black The opposite pocket is the only one he can aim at Let's celebrate He's going to try a special shot to get this He wasn't great at it at the start What makes you think he can do it now? He's doomed. He doesn't deserve to lose Look at Lung What hell is he doing? Was that a mistake? Is it mistaken? He's won! No, he must be disqualified Foul, disqualify him Check it quickly Let's check it! Void him if he's damaged it He must be disqualified I'm calling up the International Snooker Association You needn't; he's won Asshole! Damn! What are you doing? Beat him... This way, quick! Out of the way Dad, get out of the way You dare fight back? Fighting back, peasant? You're not as swift Damn it, get him! Still want to fight? Get the foreigner if you can't do it Lung, you're great Lung... kiss Mo as you're so happy Yeah, kiss her Are you crazy? No Don't be shy, come on I must make you pregnant now and we'll get married after that Good, finally!
