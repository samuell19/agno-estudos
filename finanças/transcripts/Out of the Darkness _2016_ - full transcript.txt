Henson, bring it in. [ Whoosh ] [ Bomb whistling ] Incoming! [ Gunfire ] [ Static crackles ] Uh, Red Six, Red Six, this is Red One, over. Red Six, this is Red One. Be advised, we are in the Northwest corner of the initial objective, and we are taking small-arms fire from the Western side of the initial objective. Uh, small arms and mortar fire. How copy, over? [ Static crackles ] Well... I think we found 'em. [ Chuckles ] What gives you that idea? They don't seem to be a very big group. If it's the same one. [ Explosion in distance ] Well, let's keep going. I got to say, man -- It's pretty gutsy what you did back there. You would have done the same thing, right? No, man. [ Laughs ] That was above and beyond. Jenkins thinks you have a death wish. [ Gunfire, explosions continue ] Well...it was the right thing to do. You some kind of Captain America, now? [ Laughs ] [ Static crackles ] Man: And, Tango, where are you guys at? You hear that? [ Speaking indistinctly ] No, they went behind. Don't -- do not -- [ Gunfire continues ] Tango, you guys there? Uh, Red Six, this is Red One. Roger, last transmission, over. [ Static crackles ] [ Helicopter blades whirring ] [ Gunfire, helicopter approaches ] [ Birds chirping ] Hey, Eli. Eli: Yeah? Boss wants to see you. [ Insects buzzing ] Wish me luck. [ Horse snorts ] Okay. I'll look into it and get back to you. Hey, Jerry. Eli, hello. Hi. Look, I want to make this as painless as possible. Every month I sit down and evaluate everybody on the ranch. It's something I do, so don't take it personal. [ Laughs ] Are we done? First of all, I'm not gonna go over every single reason why I've come to this decision. I've given you plenty of time to make the changes I've suggested, and frankly, Eli, you're just not suited for this job. Figures. There comes a time when a father has to stop bailing his son out, and I believe that time is now. [ Scoffs ] I mean, I can't mold you into something you're not. And these men here, well, it wouldn't be fair to them, would it if it looks like I'm just giving the job to anybody walkin' in off the prairie? Really? Hey, my responsibility is this business, Eli. I'm just looking out for what's best for the ranch. You're a grown man. No. You're doing what's best for yourself. Last I checked, that's your name on the gate out there. Look, Dad, if you don't want to help me, then don't. I didn't come here expecting some handout from you. You have got to be kidding me. That's exactly why you came to me 'cause you had nowhere else to go! I obviously came to the wrong place, so I'm sorry. It won't happen again. You know what, Eli? I got news for you, buddy. I'm not the enemy here. -[ Scoffs ] You do a right fine job driving your own life into the ground. That's -- That's not how I raised you, son. I mean, I would've thought the service would've taught you somethin' -- discipline, honor, responsibility. Where's all that at? Dad, why don't you just fire me and get this over with? I'm trying to get you to listen to me, Eli! [ Chuckles ] I am listening. Dad, I hear you loud and clear. I don't think you do. If you were smart, you would look at this as an opportunity for you to stand up and be a man for once. [Sighs] I pray you see it as I do for once. Yeah, when's the last time you prayed for anybody but yourself? [ Smacks lips ] All right, go home, Eli. You know, I worked really hard to get where I'm at today. I grabbed that bull by the horns, and I made something of myself, and I think it's high time you did the same. [ Horse snorts ] [ Somber music plays ] [ Telephone rings ] Eli: Mom... please, you got to help me. No, I-I don't want you to go against what he says, it's just that I... Woman: [ Speaking indistinctly ] It's just until I found another j-- W-Well, I-I don't know. M-Mom, come on, I need this. Y-you got to help me, please. How can this be for my own good? So, you want to, uh, see your grandchild begging for change on the corner of Main Street and -- [ Speaking indistinctly ] No. No, no, Mom. Mom, I'm sorry. D-Don't -- don't -- don't hang up. Don't hang u-- [ Grunts ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Crowd booing ] Oh, boy. No! [ Sobbing ] [ Chuckles ] It's gonna be all right. [ Sobbing loudly ] Come on, son, there's someone who wants to meet you. Who? Uh, you'll see. I don't want to meet anybody, Dad. [ Chuckles ] -I just want to go home. -Trust me, Eli. I thought they killed you. Oh, Kleiver? Nah, he couldn't keep me down for too long, not even if he tried. You know what they say -- Cheaters never win in the long run. And next time I get him in the ring, I'm gonna get him good. You're the best, Jeremy. Is your dad gonna bring you to the show next Saturday? Can we, Dad? Please? How about we come every week, Eli? -Yes! -[ Laughs ] Sounds like a pretty great dad you got there, Eli. Got to head back home for the week. Okay, we got to get out of here, too, "Bubba." You ready? -Bye, Jeremy. Bye, Eli. Mr. Isaacson. -Thank you, sir. Thank you. I told you he'd be okay, didn't I, son? Yeah. You were right, Dad. How'd you know? Eli, when you do what's right -- all the rules and don't cheat in life -- you always end up ahead. -You're pretty smart, Dad. -I try to be. [ Birds chirping ] [ Engine rumbles, shuts off ] [ Piano plays ] [ Sighs ] It's been quite a day. [ Chuckles ] Grandma, you told me to be strong. [ Intercom beeps ] Woman: Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender, please. Where have you been? I got here as soon as I could. Well, not soon enough. She doesn't have much time, Eli. Well, what do you want me to say? I'm sorry. It's not us you need to be saying you're sorry to. Come on, Mom. Don't use that tone with your mother. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry. [ Sighs ] She's been asking for you for hours, Eli. I think she's holding on just to see you. Didn't you get any of our messages? -Yeah, I saw them, but -- -Oh, so you got our messages, so your phone's working. [ Flatly ] Yes. -Have you been drinking? -What? You heard me. Your grandmother's on her deathbed and all you can do is think about being out there indulging yourself? -I was not indulging myself. -You were drinking. -I had one drink. -Exactly, I knew it. How does that make you feel, Eli? Your grandmother's last memory of her grandson is him drunk. What's your recruiter gonna think about that? I'm not drunk. I was spending time with my friends at my sendoff party, and some spilled her drink on my jacket. Y-You know, you always draw these -- these ridiculous and stupid conclusions about me like you -- like you think you know me, and you don't, Dad. -[ Sighs ] Okay, so I'm gonna go spend time with my dying grandmother in the other room -- and is the only person who shows any interest in the real me. [ Monitor beeping ] I'm gonna be in heaven soon. -No. -I can see it. Please, Grandma, I need you here. [ Sighs ] We're never ready to let anyone go. No, please don't go, not now. Not now, please. [ Sighs ] Someday, you're going to do something great with your life. You're going to use your talents to create something so beautiful and see how God was leading you to your destination the whole time. Everything happens for a reason, Eli. You must be brave and take courage. [ Chuckles ] -[ Sniffles] -[ Sighs ] I don't know how. He will lead you through the highway, Eli. Everything is gonna be all right... even if I'm not here. I'll always be proud of you -- forever. I love you, my darling grandson. You must persevere. Eli. Yeah. You must have faith. [ Voice breaking ] I-I'm trying. I'm trying, Grandma. [ Sighs ] [ Engine rumbling ] [ Engine shuts off ] Piece of junk! [ Sighs ] [ Keys jingle ] [ Door slams ] Girl: Daddy's here. No, no, no. Go sit down. Please? -You're home early. -Yeah. What happened? Look, Ganeen, I don't want to talk about it, all right? I'm in a bad mood. -[ Sighs ] Our mortgage is due in two weeks. [ Scoffs ] You pay half of it. We count on you. And do you know that we wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't quit your dancing job? You know I couldn't keep doing that job, Eli. [ Chuckling ] Ohh. That's right. I'm sorry. I forgot. You've changed. Eli. Eli, we need to talk about this. What? You know what, Ganeen, at some point, I just have to stop believing that everything is my fault. I mean, think about it -- Either everyone I know is out to get me for some reason, or I have the worst luck in the universe. The universe isn't out to get you. My life isn't easy, either. And that's my fault, too, right? I shouldn't have to have two jobs because you can't hold one. If you're so unhappy, why don't you just go? [Sighs] Are we really back at that, again? Well... guess I don't need this, anymore. The clothes don't make the man, Eli. It's not about the stupid vest, Ganeen. What, so, it's my fault you lost your job? You sound ridiculous. Yeah, well... That's me -- ridiculous. Why are you still with me if I'm such a loser? How about this -- I'll go. Is that better? I'll get out of the way of your happiness. Is that useful enough for you? -If you walk out again -- -What? What are you going to do? You going to find some little -- good little Christian and play house? I'm sure he'll be pleased to find out about your past life as a stripper. Aw, I'm sorry -- "exotic dancer," right? Yeah, that's better. You know why we aren't happy, Ganeen? It is impossible to be happy with someone like you. [ Weakly ] I'm sorry. [ Keys jingle ] [ Sighs ] Eli, don't leave. Where you going, Daddy? [ Door slams ] [ Tires squeal ] [ Mid-tempo country music plays ] * I could make a million bucks * Hey, Eli. Howdy, John. Kind of empty here tonight, huh? Eh, it's all right with me. Hey, look, I'm, uh -- I'm sorry about what happened. What happened? You gettin' fired and all. [ Sighs ] * ...but it's on my mind * * Oh, on my mind * [ Cellphone ringing ] * This feeling I'm feeling right now * [ Ringing continues ] * I like it so much * Hey, can I get a -- get a shot of whiskey, too, please? Rough night? [ Scoffs ] Rough life. How long you been coming in here, Eli? Um... Well, about since you -- you bought the place, I think. Yeah. [ Chuckles ] It used to be a dump. [ Sighs ] I didn't change a thing. [ Chuckles ] Really? Yeah. Oh... So, I know it's none of my business, but what's going on with you and Ganeen? [ Sighs ] Things change, Tim. I still remember the night you two laid eyes on each other. -[ Scoffs ] -It was different. "Different"? [ Laughs ] She didn't come in here too often, but when she did, every guy in here would trip over themselves to catch her eye. Yeah. I remember you sittin' about right there. And she -- she comes up to you. Yeah. [ Scoffs ] Like a... like a lost puppy. Could've been. I just know that, uh, when you two were talkin', there was a connection there, like you were the only two people in the room. I don't see that too often -- as if it were, uh, meant to happen. [ Laughs ] Oh, Tim, you sound like you're talking about God in a bar. If you want to call it that, sure. Can't get away from Him. What? Nothing. [ Sighs ] * Yeah, and I might do it again tomorrow * * You got a Mercedes-Benz and a uptown smile * * Riding the real problem ain't your style * * Well, let me take you on a knee * * Yeah, I smell that sweet perfume * * And it always reminds me of you * * And a few summers ago * * I can't see it in your walk * Night, Eli. * And in your voice when you talk * [ Engine starts ] [ Engine rumbles, tires squeal ] [ Sighs ] [ Mid-tempo country music plays ] * He's gonna take * [ Sighs ] * Take it too far * * He's running out * * You looking at me? * * Hiding words * * Not a frown... * * And I know [ Static crackles ] Man: And when Jesus said that he's the light of the world, ...that means we are the light of the world, too. We shine in the darkness. And when light shines in the darkness, nothing can hide from it. [ Static crackles ] [ Radio clicks ] Of course. * You ain't gettin' nowhere fast * Loser. What a bunch of...idiots. [ Groans ] I work harder than any of them. Eli's father: [ Echoing ] Take some responsibility. [ Coughs ] And for what, Dad? Why, so you can fire me? Thanks, "Pop." Yeah, no matter what you say, Dad... I got a family. You've been nothing but a problem from day one. See, Dad? You see? [ Chuckles ] Maybe you shouldn't have been born in our family. [ Grunts ] Oh, no. [ Echoing ] Come back, Daddy. [ Grunts ] [ Crash ] Oh, boy. [ Sighs ] [ Grumbles ] [ Sighs ] Hello? Hello? Hello? Anyone? Hello? Hello? Help. Anyone? Help! [ Birds chirping ] [ Grunts ] [ Sighs ] Yeah, okay. Now, wait, just -- [ Groans ] I just went this way. [ Sighs ] I just -- every -- What? Hello! Anyone! [ Groans ] [ Sighs ] Aah! [ Rustling ] Don't be stupid, Eli. It's just the wind. [ Heavy growling, breathing ] Oh! [ Grunts ] I told you to take care of it, son. Take some responsibility. But, no, you've just been one failure on top of another. You've been nothing but a problem from day one. Maybe you shouldn't have been born in our family. Or maybe you shouldn't have been born at all. [ Electronic dance music plays ] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! [ Cheering ] Drink up, man. Live for today. Live for tonight. We shouldn't have to care about anything else. Just look around -- Life is one big party. Who cares about Ganeen? [ Laughs ] Who cares about anything! [ Howls ] [ Cheering ] Yeah-ha! [ Piano plays ] Hey, Eli. I'm so happy. The weight... it's been lifted. You still don't see it, do you? No more striving. No more doubt. If only you opened your eyes. No. [ Sighs ] No. Open your eyes. [ Gasps ] [ Sighs ] [ Groans ] [ Spitting ] [ Chuckles ] [ Groans ] Come on. [ Sighs ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] We are but a vapor. Whoo! Ooh! [ Laughs ] Aah! [ Laughs ] Whew! That's it?! That's how it's supposed to end? I'm going to die here alone, and no one will ever know it! Eli's Grandmother: Grandson, always remember to put your trust in the Lord. He'll never let you down. I love you. [ Wind whistling ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] This isn't... [ Sighs ] [ Sniffles ] This doesn't make sense. The fire should be... Is somebody out there? Hello! [ Bird caws ] [ Ominous tones play ] [ Grunts ] [ Somber music plays ] Woman: We may get together to study God's word, but you know that it's so much more than that. I mean, we're here to support you. So tell us what's going on. You know how Eli is. Our last argument... was really bad, and... he left. I think that this is it. Do you think he's gonna leave you? [ Sighs ] I don't... I don't know. I don't -- A part of me... just wants to show him the door with his bags packed. I'm hurting. And yet... "And yet" what, honey? Maybe God's trying to show me something. I had a dream last night. and I don't remember much, you know? But when I woke up suddenly... I heard the words, "Eli's time has come." And I got this terrible feeling. And... all I could do was pray. So, that's what I've been doing, but... [ Sighs ] I think that's why we're here. We're reinforcements. Come on, ladies. [ Sighs ] Father... we come to you with heavy hearts but hopeful hearts because we know that you love us. [Sighs] And, Lord, we want to lift up Ganeen, and we lift up Eli. You know him, and you know what he's going through. And we know that the enemy would seek to steal, kill, and destroy him completely. Father, we ask you protect him, that you'd reveal yourself to him in a way that speaks to his deepest heart. We ask this in your mighty name. Amen. [ Ominous tones play ] I know you're out there! I'm armed! Just don't come near me, spirits of... [ Birds chirping ] This is crazy. [ Scoffs ] [ Bird caws ] [ Flashlight thunks ] Please, stop! Why don't you help me out of here? Of course you won't. [ Sighs ] [ Low rumbling ] [ Voices whispering indistinctly ] Hello? Show yourself! [ Whispering continues ] [ Rumbling continues ] [ Insects buzzing ] [ Ominous tones play ] [ Laughs ] [ Wind whistling ] Girl: I miss you too, Daddy. Hannah? Come on, Daddy! Hannah? Where are you, darling? I have something for you. Over here, Daddy. Hurry, Daddy. It's just for you. You're not Hannah. Yes I am. [ Growls ] [ Echoing ] Come back, Daddy. [ Birds chirping ] [ Bird caws ] [ Gasps ] [ Chuckles ] [ Ominous tones play ] [ Water splashes ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Mid-tempo music plays ] [ Laughs ] -Happy with yourself? -[ Gasps ] What? [ Sighs ] How do I know if this is real? It was you, wasn't it? You're the one who's doing all this. No, Eli. Then, who, t-the Indian spirits? I've appeased them. How far off the path you have gone. You remember, don't you? It was a long time ago. Eli... I knew that you were special from the beginning -- set apart. I don't believe in that stuff anymore, okay? It's for losers. It's for people who -- who can't make it on their own. And your life is so much better without it? You died. When you left, it left. [ Sighs ] Eli, are you listening? [ Sighs ] [ Heart beating loudly ] [ Snorting, growling ] Man: Eli! Eli Isaacson? Yeah, I'm Eli. [ Sighs ] -Oh, well... we have been looking for you. I-I crashed my truck, and I'm -- I got lost. Yeah, we know. -P-People are looking for me? -Oh, definitely. Yeah, but I'm glad we found you. Your family's been getting a little worried about you, son. M-my family? I-I-I -- [ Scoffs ] Hey, listen, uh, let me take a look at you. Let me, uh, make sure you're doing okay. Hey, I-I just want to get out of here, okay? I understand. Just hold tight. It's all procedure. -Fine, can, um -- -Well, look at me, son. [ Breathes deeply ] Let me see. Well, you look fine. Yeah, right, "fine." So... What you doing up here by yourself anyway? I just driving. Just driving? Listen, son, no one just drives up here in these parts. Yeah, well, this thing with my girlfriend and... Women -- Enough to drive you crazy. Say no more. I'll tell you though -- If your relationship is causing you to drive up so far away from home, maybe it's ain't worth the trouble, you know? Really? You got to look out for yourself, son. You know, don't get tricked, you know, into thinking that you have, you know, all these responsibilities to other people. You lose yourself that way -- you know, your dreams. It's like they say on the airplanes with the oxygen masks, you know? You got to put yours on first. I mean, if you don't take care of yourself first... [scoffs] there may be no "you" to take care of. My advice to you -- Look out for número uno. [ Sighs ] Yeah. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. You are darn right it does. Try telling that to my girlfriend. You know, you been up here for days on end because of her. You know, she drove you to this. If she is that much of a hassle, you need to cut her loose, man. I'm sorry. Where did you say your team was? Hey, man, where are we? Do you even know how to get out of here? Hold your horses, son. I've got a map here. I'll show you where we are. Okay. Okay, so this is where we find your truck, right? And this is where we are now. Now, if you would have kept walking around this direction, you'd hit the highway. See, now, really, you ain't all that far from where you started. You're just a little turned around is all. No, no, it's -- it was like a maze. Yeah, it'll happen out here. You got to be careful. These woods can play tricks on you. W-what about the -- There's the -- I found some old graveyard thing, and it's not on the map. Yeah, well, you know... I wouldn't worry too much about that. You know, a few days up here by yourself, and you're bound to go a little bit [clicks tongue] nutty. No. I-It -- I was hearing weird things, man. There was like -- There were figures and shadows. [ Sighs ] I-I heard two men fighting or something? It's -- [ Sighs ] Look, I-I know it sounds crazy, okay? I just -- [ Sighs ] I'm not a mountain man. [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] Thank God you found me. That's what we're here for -- You know, to help confused people find their way. [ Ominous tones play ] So, uh... [ Sighs ] Do you think your team will be long, or... Yeah, they know I'm here. You know, we keep track of each other, yeah. They won't be long. Don't worry. You'll see. Hey, man, again, thank you. I just -- I feel much better having you here. Really? Good. That's the way it should be. Here, hold this for a minute. [ Static crackles ] I ain't got good reception out here, so I'm gonna walk over here and use this, but, uh, I need you to stay put. [ Scoffs ] Where am I gonna go? Ah, I hear you there. Stay put. [ Sighs ] Yeah. [ Roar in distance ] [ Whoosh, wings flap ] [ Sighs ] Hey, come on! Where'd you go?! Oh, no. No. [ Ominous tones play ] I can't do this in the dark! Hello? Hello? [ Sighs ] Stop. Please, just stop. [ Gasps ] Get back here. Don't make me hunt you down. You gonna shoot me? I just want to find out who was peekin' in the flap of my tent. Who are you? Who am I? What's more important is, "Who are you?" It doesn't matter who I am. Oh, I beg to differ with you, young man. If you don't tell me, I'm gonna get Mordecai to run you off 'and make sure you never come back here again, and I can go back inside to my nice, warm abode and continue having a quiet evening. Mordecai your gun? [ Rifle clicks ] Now what kind of moron names his gun? Mordecai. M-Mordecai's that dog? Well, he ain't my kin. Look, son, I'm freezing my tail off out here. Either we can go inside and continue this discussion, or you can go back to where you come from and, uh, we'll call it a night. [ Thunder rumbling ] Come on in. My name's Gabe. You look like you've seen better days. [ Scoffs ] Yeah, so do you. You want something to drink? [ Rain pattering ] Uh, whiskey. [ Laughs ] I have, uh, coffee. Bet you're hungry, too, huh? Yeah, I'm starving. Well, I do have some, uh, chicken. You have chicken? It's over there in a cooler. Sorry it's not warm. I am not one to complain. So you say. [ Thunder rumbles ] I see it's to your liking. Mm-hmm. So, what brings you to my neck of the woods? I crashed my truck. Mm-hmm. What? Well, why didn't you stay put until somebody rescued you? My head was spinning. Everything was fuzzy. I just -- I-I got confused. [ Chuckling ] Oh, yeah. Yeah, that happens. Look, do other people live up here, other, uh, forest people? "Forest people"? You mean like... little people with colored overalls and tall, pointy hats? No, I mean are there other people up here besides you? Nope, just me and Mordecai. That's about it. Why? Have you seen any of these little, uh, forest people? [ Scoffs ] No, no, but -- [ Sighs ] [ Thunder rumbles ] Never mind. Actually, I have seen a few strange things in these woods. Like what? A grown men wandering aimlessly for days on end, calling from the rapid beat of his own heart, brash from the raven's cry, furious, self-destructive as a grizzly, all the while acting like he's been raised by wolves. Strange things -- strange things, Eli. Yeah, well, now I see why you don't have any guests. [ Laughs ] You have to admit... [ Laughs ] I had you going there for a spell. [ Laughs ] -You know what? No. I don't have to admit anything. Aha! That's your trouble -- not admitting. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me or my life story. So enlighten me. No. I-I don't owe you anything, old man. Come with me. W-what? No. Why would I do that? Are you always so obstinate? You're a guest in my tent. You've eaten my food. And if you want to enjoy the warmth of my fire, you'll help an old man get some more wood. Well? [ Scoffs ] So, you have a family? Yeah. [ Grunts ] Kind of. You, uh, "kind of" have a family? Yeah. [ Sighs ] I've got a girlfriend and a daughter. So you have people who care about you? They'll be looking for you. [ Sighs ] Nobody knows I'm lost. [ Grunts ] I've been, uh -- I've disappeared before. So, no. Nobody's looking for me. Oh, I disagree. It sounds like you've been lost even longer than you think. Hand me that piece of wood there. Nice. Bring the rest. Well? Could I ask you a question? Fire away. "Fire away." [ Laughs ] That's a good one. Why haven't you asked me the way out yet? What? You're lost, and you haven't asked me the way out of these woods. I have, uh-- I have this map. You have a map of these woods? Yeah, it's this right here. If I leave in the morning, I can find my own way out of here. [ Chuckles ] Not with this, you won't. Who gave you this map? The, uh -- the park ranger. "The park ranger" -- Here? Yeah, he was -- He was looking for me. I'm sure he was. Well, he disappeared. Look, man, it doesn't matter what I say. Anything I tell you, it's just gonna make me sound crazy. So can we just drop it? If you'd like. Why don't you tell me about your daughter? My daughter? Yeah. It's been a long time since I've been around little ones. What's she like? [ Sighs ] She's amazing. She just turned 4 a few months ago, and we might be putting her in preschool soon. I think. I-I don't really -- I don't know, 'cause I don't really make those decisions. What's her name? Hannah. "Hannah-Banana," That's what I call her... -[ Chuckles ] -yeah, if, um -- if I tuck her in at night. "If?" Why? You work late, or... Nope. [ Sighs ] I'm jobless. Well, I'd say raising a little one's a pretty important job. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess -- I guess you're right. You know, I... I don't know why I'm telling you all this stuff. I don't even know what I'm doing here. You're right. You don't. That's what got you here in the first place. [ Sighs ] Yeah, I guess you're right. So, tell me more about, uh...Hannah. What else do you want me to say? That I'm not around to tuck her in at night or... watch her paint her paintings or when she wants to dress up, or that I'm just this deadbeat, jobless dad w-who cares more about spending time at the bar and watching football than taking care of his family? Is that what you want to hear? Hey, just consider me your sounding board. [ Scoffs ] Right. So, are you churchgoers? [ Sighs ] Yeah. They go. But not you? You know what, man? I don't think this is any of your business. You know, frankly, you're right. Everything you told me is none of my business, but it just seems like you, uh, need to get a few things off your chest. [ Scoffs ] Come on, Mordecai. Hey, you're still here. God hasn't been a part of my life for a long time. So I figure... [ Sighs ] why involve Him now? [ Thunder crashes in distance ] [ Laughs ] You think that's funny? I don't need a man-made map for this ever-changing wilderness, and neither do you, Eli. It was you, wasn't it? You did this. Y-You're the one who's been keeping my fire going and got me all turned around in the woods. No. Open your eyes, son. There's a lot more going on here than -- No, you open your eyes, old man! It's my life, okay? I'm in charge of my life. I control my destiny, no one else -- me. You got it? -Oh, I got it. I get that you're not getting it. But it'll happen. It'll happen when you're ready. What'll happen? You gonna do something? It's hard to understand but, trust me, it will happen. No, I-I don't have to trust you. If you don't trust me, trust God. -[ Scoffs ] He's looking after you. There's a battle going on for you that's even bigger than you can believe. Stop it. [ Groans, laughs ] [ Inhales deeply ] Ohh. [ Groans ] [Sighs] I feel like I'm going crazy. That's what happens. It's all part of the process. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry. No apology needed. May I pray for you? Y-You want to pray for me? Are you serious? If you'll allow it. All right, um, just -- just don't expect me to do any of that... praying-after-you... whatever stuff, okay? Of course. Heavenly Father, I'm with Eli. He's suffered in these woods. I pray to you, God, that you will heal him. Lead him out of this wilderness and back home to his family, who need him and love him. [ Thunder rumbles in distance ] I ask this, that you warm him in Your love. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. [ Sniffles ] Come on inside. I'll get you some blankets. [ Sighs ] [ Birds chirping ] No. [ Sighs ] No, this isn't happening. No, this isn't happening. I didn't dream this. I didn't dream it! Come on! Hello?! Gabe! Mordecai! [ Ominous tone plays ] I can't -- I can't believe it. [ Wind whistling ] What's going on? Okay! Okay, God, if this is really you, let me see you. Come on! Show yourself! Big, mighty, powerful Jesus! Come on! [ Whistling continues ] You want me to believe you're real, show me something! Come on, give me fire right now! Come on! Do it again! Give me food, give me shelter, give me something! [ Whistling continues ] Yeah, I knew it! I knew it wasn't you! I mean, why would you want to help me, huh? I mean, me! Is this punishment, torture? What, you want me to die out here, freeze to death? My little girl back at home not knowing that I was sorry -- I'm not supposed to die out here. [ Voice breaking ] What about the calling of my life? What about your calling? [ Whistling continues, thunder crashes ] God, please... don't let me die, not now. I put my trust in you. Please help me. I need you. [ Whistling stops ] [ Horn honking ] [ Thump ] [ Brakes hiss, squeak ] [ Engine stops, door opens, closes ] [ Footsteps approach ] Man: Hey, buddy, are you okay? [ Laughing ] [ Somber music plays ] -Daddy! -Hey, Banana. Come here, baby. Ohh. Hannah, go to your room. But I want to see Daddy. Hannah. No, that's okay. Do what your mom says. Go on. Go. [ Sighs ] [ Door slams ] What are you doing? [ Sighs ] Listen, um, I know -- I know that -- "Know" -- Eli, you don't know anything. You don't know how hard it is to tell my 4-year-old daughter why her daddy disappears and doesn't show up for a week. You don't know. No, um... [ clears throat ] you're right. Where were you? [ Sighs ] Um... That's all you have for me -- nothing? I don't have any excuses. No more, um -- I don't have any justification, no more -- no more lies. This time was different. I wish I could undo all the -- all the lies and convince you that -- that I've changed, but, um... I just wish you could believe me. I do, but I understand if you can't. The other night, um... [ sniffles ] I left the bar, and I-I drove into the mountains. And, um, I crashed my truck into the woods, and I got lost. And that's where I've been ever since. I don't want to fight anymore, okay? You're right. I-I'm a horrible father. I'm a horrible boyfriend. [ Scoffs ] I don't expect you to believe me. But, Ganeen, I'm different. [ Sighs ] I can't even explain it to myself. [ Sighs ] Try me. Really? Really. This is all very... un-Eli-ish of you. [ Chuckles ] It is un-Eli-ish, isn't it? [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] I think it's God. [ Sighs ] God? Eli... what happened to you? I-I don't know. It was some kind of, um... like a battle. I never -- I never told you -- Well, I never told anybody this. Um... There was this one week when I was 10. My parents dropped me off at my Grandma Meredith's place. She always believed in me when no one else would, you know? She told me that she had been fasting a-and praying for me. [Sighs] She believed I had a calling, a great purpose in life. A few years later, she died. I was, uh... I was, uh -- [ Chuckles ] W-what kind of God would take someone like that away from you? I guess... [ Clears throat ] I guess I've just been, uh... running ever since, hiding, just fighting, you know, until now. [ Sighs ] I was h-- I was hoping you would pray with me. You want to pray? -Mm-hmm. -With me? Please. [ Laughs ] [ Breathes deeply ] Um... [ Clears throat ] Hey, God. It's, uh -- It's been a while. And, uh... Well [chuckles] a lot's happened. And, uh... I can see that it was you, Lord. I can see that it was you in everything. And, um... I know you have a lot more to teach me, and, Lord, please help me. Help me to do right by Ganeen. And, uh, help us to be better, to live with honor and, um, to not hurt each other or you. Please, Lord. In the name of Jesus... [ Breathes deeply ] amen. [ Sighs ] [ Exhales deeply ] Wow. It's been a long time since I was in Sunday school. You guys seem really smart. I'm a little nervous. Yeah. But it's good. It's good. It's good that you're here. Who knows my daughter, Hannah? All of you? Good. Did you know that she prays for me. Did she tell you that? Did she talk about it at all? You know, she prays a lot. How many of you, uh -- How many of you kids pray for your parents? That's good. That's important. Um... We need it. [ Laughs ] It makes -- It makes a lot of difference. Yeah, um, did Hannah ever tell you guys about the time I was lost in the forest? What? How lost were you? I was so lost -- for days -- that everywhere I turned just lead me right back into the forest. I couldn't find my way out. I was so lost. I was certain I was never gonna get out of that wood. You guys ever have to go to your room because you didn't listen or, like, you didn't do something you were told, yeah? That was -- That was kind of what happened in the forest. Um... God, when he wants us to listen, sometimes he has to do something to pull us aside and say, "Hey, pay attention." But, you know, God doesn't stop there. The Bible says that Jesus then equips us to -- to do good works, to do what we were always meant to do. Yeah. My grandma told me that. She always used to tell me that and a lot more. When your heart is in the right place, get ready. Some amazing things will happen. [ Chuckles ] Are you ready?
