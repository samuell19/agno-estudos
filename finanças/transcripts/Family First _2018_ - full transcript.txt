Can we talk about it later? I'm fucking beat. I don't want us to fight. OK. Goodnight. Are you sleeping? Were you listening at the door? No. I wasn't. Want one? Go to bed, Vincent. Not there, dipshit! Vincent! OK, enough. Check this out! A nice picture. Me, Mom and JP. Cute, right? It doesn't hurt. Mornings are gonna suck when you're gone. Well, move in with me!

They aren't good for you. We aren't immortal. Have some peanut butter and toast. - What are you saying, Lil' Dan? - I told you not to call me that. JP's not fat! You need protein. - JP's not fat! - I didn't say he was. I'm just saying watch what you eat. Well, I ate three, and you didn't say a thing! Grab an apple. I'm going for a run. I need real food.

It's just that you're part of the family now. Wait a minute! Check me out. Christ! Money over Jesus What the fuck, man? Trying to be tough, man? Think you're better than me? Jesus! Know who I am? I've got an idea. Big ho, sit I said Mama over Jesus I gotta go. Now? Bye! - Bye, Mom! - Bye, sweetie! Later. JP? I need you to pay Olivier a visit. I saw him by Verdun metro again, the little shit. OK. Sorry, I was sure he'd gotten the message. You'll have to be more clear this time. Shut up! So, Mel's moving out? Yeah. She asked me to go with her. I don't know what to do. Enough with your school bullshit. OK. I'll give you real responsibilities. You'll keep doing the collections with your brother... and looking after Bob's grow-op. - Great. - Deliveries too.

I kept telling him it was this thing. I know I plugged it in right. - Idiot! - How could I have known? - You should have listened! - What do you know? I'm not as dumb as you think I am. - I'm taking Mom out tonight. - Don't be stupid. She's been sober six months. Exactly! It's just one night! - Give her a break. - This is her break!

What's up? - Got something for me? - Yeah. Give it to me. School's good? Yeah. Are you serious about that? Yeah, I am. Split this with your brother. - You don't want that life. - Sure, sure. I know you. Take a seat. Want a cold one? Sure. So, Mel... What? She cut her family out of her life. She told me the other day. When was that? Would you do that? What? Cut out your family. Would you? Of course not. Cut yourself off completely... No, you wouldn't do that. Well, if it isn't the lovely Chantale! Danny... Go to my office. I'll be right there. - Why the hell is she here? - We have a meeting. - A meeting? - Yeah. - Like, you're gonna talk? - Yeah. - You're gonna talk? - You got a problem? Chill out! What? Sorry, I didn't get that. What? Oh, I see! JP's the boss now. I didn't get the memo. OK, OK... Don't ever tell me how to run my business. Is that clear? Got it. So... You better not choke. I, uh... I can't, Uncle Danny. It's OK. I'll find someone else. It'll take the pressure off. - That'd be great. - Yeah. You can relax. Know what? I know just who to ask. You know him! You know him well. I'll give you a hint. His name starts with V. Oh yes! Your brother has the balls to do it. OK, wait. - Wait for what? - I'll think about it. Oh, you'll think about it! You'll email me in a few months? - I don't have time for this shit! - Just not him! - Then who? - Christ, do we really have to? Clean it up. And how is the lovely Chantale? Seriously, your boyfriend is a fag. What makes you say that? Stop! Stop! Stop! I didn't do anything! Not the basket! Pick it up, Vince. Here! For you! In the basket! In the basket? Check it out. Listen. You can hear the ocean. Just listen. It'll help you focus. Come on! Move closer. Hear it? God of butter... give JP the strength... to pass his exams.

Yes, yes, yes! Activity! Hey, Vince, what time is it? - Hand me a plate? - I'll grab you one, sweetie. Why don't we snack on a nice little veggie? - A nice little cucumber? - Oh, yum! Oh, I stained my shirt! - You always do that. - I'm a big baby. I'm always getting stains. - What are you doing? - I gotta go. You're not staying for supper? You gotta eat with us!

You wouldn't smile. Look at that pout! Remember? Danny forced you to be in the picture. You were hiding behind the couch! I didn't like pictures. I can't believe you found this! You all right? I was prettier as a brunette. - No way! You look great. - I looked like a pin-up. Why'd you turn it off? Vincent? You have nice hair. Thanks... It's really nice. Why are you moving out, my sweet Mel? Come on, Vincent... You don't like us? I never said that. Well, that's OK, 'cause... we don't like you either. Let me go, Vincent. Don't you dare take my brother with you. Come here! Come! This... This is a wedding ring. And I'm married... to my family. I'm married to you. I'm married to JP. If her kids are there, be careful, OK? I'm serious. We take care of her, but not in front of the kids. You know I wouldn't do that. Sonia! I paid! I paid! We know you didn't. Vince, the kids are here. Let's go. Wow! The kids are home! Let her go! Go into the bedroom, sweetie! Go into the bedroom! Mom! Stay in here, OK? Just calm down. You didn't pay! Quit screaming. You fucking scared me! We're not bad guys. We just wanna talk to your mom. So calm down. - What's your name? - Naomie. That's a pretty name. I'm gonna play a little game, Sonia. Stay there... For fuck's sake! Cover your ears, like this. Good! Keep 'em there. Now lie here with your brother. It's your knee, or else it's your face. So put your knee back. Put your foot back on the chair. Back on the chair. That's right. - Mom! - Vince! - Bye-bye, knee! - Vince! Well? Danny won't be happy. We were supposed to fuck her up. I know. What's going on with you? I want out, man. Why? Vince, this is crazy. We have to stop. But it's our thing! JP! We're stopping. It's crazy. I can't do it anymore. Well, I can. I don't want Danny to think I wouldn't do it. Of course. - I'll tell him if you don't. - I'll tell him. I have my period. Who cares? Wait. JP... Stop! At least let me go to the bathroom. Why are you texting my uncle? It's not my fault. He started it. I'm as weirded out as you are. I'm sorry. I don't want to lose you. You won't. - Sorry about earlier. - It's OK. Hi, sweetie! Come here. Come. Everything OK? Are you gonna move in with Mel? Mom, seriously? I'm just wondering. Did I say I was leaving? - No. - Well, then... I mean, I don't think I will. Please... I won't touch a drop, I promise. I'll be good. I'll start exercising again. I won't bring anyone home. That's not it. I'll be nice to you, to everyone, I swear. OK, stop, stop! You're perfect, Mom. It has nothing to do with you. Don't leave me alone with him. I can't handle it. Hello! My loves! Look! I got married! Hey, honey, you're gonna sleep in your own room tonight, OK? Guess who I married. Guess. Who? I'll never get divorced. I'll never get divorced. Never! That's enough! Out! Give her a fucking break! Go sleep in your room. Goodnight. Goodnight to you, JP. My buddy has this silk shirt with dragons on it. - There's no dragons. - Hi! Danny brought us a surprise! There are sausages if you want. Oh yeah? I don't know. My stomach hurts. Again? You've always got a stomach ache. Got anything for me? No. Did you mess her up, at least? Well... We gave her a good scare, but I didn't touch her. It's not my fault. - Get the hell out! - Leave me alone! You're fucking killing me! Her kids were there. Come on! Get the hell out! Go ahead, asswipe! Go fuck yourself! That's no excuse. I think it is. Vincent! What? Come see me at the bar. OK! Vince? What? Can't I shit in peace? I'll text you later. Whatever! I'm fed up with your fucking crazy family. They piss me off. All of them. I can't wait to get the hell out of here. Mel... He gives me shit, and you don't do anything about it! If the resistors are the same, then you take the resistance value divided by the number of resistors. If a circuit has four resistors of the same value, say 100 ohm, you divide by four. An R of 100 divided by four... I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you, I swear to God! Is there something wrong? Mom? My dear, sweet mommy... What's wrong? Darling Mommy... What's going on? What's going on? Come here. Hold me. Hold me in your arms. It'll feel good. Squeeze me tight. Everything else is shit, but we're doing all right. We're all right. You're crying. You're crying! Mom!
