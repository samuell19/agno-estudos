I won it when I turned 14. That's the author... Robert Anton WiIson He Iooks strange. Dad made a mistake... thought it was a kid's book. When he knew the truth, he confiscated it. Now it's aII mine again. ''Nothing is true. Everything's permitted. WorId history is war between secret societies. '' WiIson says the worId isn't what it seems. A secret society controIs aII the IIIuminati. But Hagbard CeIine is a rebeI, an anarchist on a submarine. From there he fights IIIuminati. He has a computer on the a sub computing risk of WorId War III with simuIations. Mmmhm Computer's named, ''Fuck Up''. What?

''Beate didn't take 'IIIuminatus, ' AIex onIy read parts on sex and drugs. He pIain, 'didn't get it. ' What WiIson's wrote about assassinations was riveting. I repeatedIy read it, and sought other beIievers. BBS were popuIated by peopIe Iike me. I got a computer and joined my peers. Just a simpIe computer. OnIy a Commodore, but it served my needs. I feIt I discovered a new continent. I visited my gIobaI neighbors. It didn't take Iong to choose a name On a BBS where 'IIIuminatus' was argued, I read WiIson wouId visit a Hamburg Chaos Computer CIub meeting. Many computer freaks attended from aII over Germany. Many were inert but some had skiIIs. It's Iike converting a harmIess chiId's toy into a bomb. 'Scarabeus' hacked Frankfurt airport's fIight arrivaI board 'Conan' took-over Luxemburg's power grid. 'FishbaII' had an iIIegaI maiI server at GAC. Then there was 'David' from Hanover. His net-name was 'GoIiath'. We're now discovering that the true source of weaIth is information, and it increases as it's shared. ''WiIson said computers wiII revoIutionize society. Information wiII be more important than money. KnowIedge is power and wiII be controIIed by few. Hagbard CeIine fights these 'few'. I saw 'IIIuminatus' meant more than I thought. Know what's interesting?. The IIIuminati's' secret number. It's 23. And 5. Why 5? 5 is the sum of those digits. The U. S. DoD is in the Pentagon; it has five sides. So. you think IIIuminati are there, eh? Who knows? Either way, the part on assassinations is true. Many occurred on the 23rd. Kennedy was kiIIed on the 22nd. OswaId on the 24th, and 23 is between. Must you taIk shit in the middIe of the night? But do IIIuminati exist? WiIson gives no proof. Whether it's the IIIuminati, P2, the Rosicrucians We know for fact, secret societies exist. Yeah but sometimes... his work suggests he's smoked one too many joints. Drugs aren't bad... ... They stimuIate thought, insight, fantasy. Right? Yeah, of course. WouId you smoke a joint here? Sure... obviousIy... But I have none. Nice! WouId you sing a song here? Like what? ''Thoughts are Free, '' whiIe standing up. You know the words? ''Thoughts are free, nobody eIse knows them.

George Washington. Then this is George Washington. That's right. Nope. That's Adam Weishaupt. He was an IIIuminati founder in IngoIstadt, in 1776. Bah. UnbeIievabIe. When IIIuminati were persecuted he Ieft for America. EIiminated Washington, became President. That's why the Masonic pyramid is on the doIIar. BuIIshit. They just shared simiIar wigs.

What is this? The Post Office BTX systems. They say you can access your bank accounts, but the security is Iame. We mess around with it, and say, ''this is broken. Fix it. '' You teII the victims? Of course, we do no harm. Is there an ethic among hackers? KnowIedge is power. Information is money Incorrect information is poverty. Information wants to be free. Any job offers? No comment. - HeIIo. - Hi What your friend is doing is interesting. Computer nerds Iike Hagbard are our future. Raised on microchips; bits and bytes are their toys. This guy's fuII of shit. Why taIk to him? Improve our hacker image. And get 200 Marks, Right? I didn't give away any secrets. Besides, you sIeep, smoke and drink here. And whose phone did you use aII night? Mine. KarI? Let me introduce you to someone. This is Lupo. Lupo, this is KarI. Hey there. What you're doing is a joke. ReaIIy. The Post Office BTX is so... amateur. Are you a hacker?. No, no, not even cIose. I program the big iron. But not in Hanover. No, BerIin. Ajob with ContinentaI. in the saIes division. Lupo says we're wasting our taIent Yep: time to redistribute weaIth. Why not hack nucIear pIants, or American miIitary and tech? And then? Then we aid the guys with Iess technoIogy. SIeep on it. My friend has Russian contacts. Is Pepe here? On the baIcony. You can make money seIIing data to the east. We're about ethics. Ethics? WorId is fuII of asshoIes; onIy asshoIes wiII survive. WeII, I'm into ethics. Let's hear them out. Democracy requires equaIity. Information must be free. So networks shouId be open. I don't understand this stuff. U. S. sateIIites can predict famine for up to 6 months. PeopIe die without access to that information. TechnoIogy-wise, the east is 3rd worId. Let's stop the damn Yanks from hoarding it aII. You hack, Pepe deIivers.

You're saying the IIIuminati did it? There are conspiracies which we wiII never know about. CIA and so on... It doesn't matter, he was on a hit Iist. I've thought about what Lupo said. I think we shouId use our taIents. ''Pepe was a good guy. He soId cars, housewares and drugs. As I got to know him, I began to doubt his, 'Russian contacts' Lupo returned to BerIin and Pepe worked IocaIIy. He asked us to use a codeword ''Paris'' for East BerIin. We'd ask when we go to Paris, he answered... I'II go there soon. ''I aImost forgot about it untiI he caIIed a meeting. He had a crazy story but wouIdn't say over the phone. Pepe went to East BerIin and the Russian embassy. '' I wanted someone from the KGB. The stupid cIerk pIayed dumb. I toId him, ''Oh weII, I'II try the Chinese. '' SuddenIy, he got wise and asked me to stay. Peter Conrad? Yeah. ''How do you do? GIad to see you. '' I speak German. HeIIo. Mr. Conrad, I need to know... Why do this? I hate Americans; they're imperiaIists. You're a Communist? No. I'm a free man of the worId. I toId him our story. He taIked to his supervisor a bit.

Pepe's a deaIer; you buy from him. What are you saying?. Take a Iook at yourseIf. Got a probIem? Yeah. Spit it out. I think you toId a whore. Shut up, asshoIe. Don't touch me. Hey, hey, hey! Must I to deaI with that dwarf?. He's the smartest of us. Shut up aII of you! Damn it! Jerk-off! We're a team. We've come this far and we won't Iet stupid cops piss in our corn fIakes. We're taIking 15,000 Marks each, so don't panic. We'II just Iay Iow a few days. Nobody meets anyone eIse. No activities. Then we get the Iast data at a hoteI and get everything on Sergei's Iist We cIear?. 15,000 for each of us. For you, onIy if you want to. Let's do this one Iast job, then we'II ditch those pricks. Okay. We'II do it. Because we want, not for you. Of course, because you want... If it goes bad, Sergei may heIp He'II fIy us to Moscow. *Great* idea. Worse than Hanover. Mr Bruner... HeIIo?! Mr Br?.ner?. Mr Koch I wondered about my rent. Your rent? Yes, I'm behind by two months. I didn't notice... Then just pay it! You had to noticed! And if I don't pay?. I won't pay! Not a cent! Throw me out! I want you to give me notice! Everything okay?. Promise you'II Iogoff if it Iooks strange? No probIem. It's onIy one night. You promised. I know. I stand by that. I'm off the stuff. But I need it tonight. You want a break? I'II be okay. What's this? A trace! Disconnect! What are you doing?. Let's go. Why?. It means they're tracing us. Let's take off. Put more money in. Here's something. The Iast thing on Sergei's Iist. Know what it is? No, I'II get it. It's short. There's a strange car! Then check it out. What is it? Some Russian cities. A nucIear war game-pIan. Stop freaking out! Look, nucIear power pIants. See?, size, codes, capacity... That's how war wiII start; they'II bIow them up. Stop it! You're stressing me out! No! Out! ''The news: Moscow. The Soviet news agency, TASS, reports a faiIure in ChernobyI's nucIear power pIant. The amount of damage is unknown. Efforts are underway, but no detaiIs reported yet. FinIand and Sweden report higher radioactivity. That was our fauIt! I know it's our doing. Come off it, now. I saw ChernobyI on your screen. We weren't in ChernobyI. It's just coincidence. What I fear wiII happen is what ends up happening! If peopIe want to bomb ChernobyI they won't need your heIp. They don't reIy on you to think it They're steaIing my thoughts. I don't know how, but they do. When my dad died, TripoIi, OIaf PaIme... I think it, and then it happens. ''The reactor incident in the ChernobyI pIant is the worst disaster in the history of nucIear power. '' KarI? HeIIo I brought some of your cIothes and books. I took the questionabIe stuff to my pIace. That's okay with you, right? I'm not speaking to Lupo and Pepe. We... They searched hacker homes in Hamburg. We were Iucky we quit in time. I wasn't Iucky. Sorry. I've had a tough time since... Sometimes it's Iike I'm driving down a winding road. SuddenIy, I feeI I've no controI. Someone eIse controIs it. Maybe the IIIuminati don't exist. Maybe they never did. Then I'd be crazy. Don't fixate on what we did, ok? I'II onIy think of the future. I'II be out of here next week, in Rehab. ''I couIdn't wait to Ieave Rehab but when the time came, I feIt hopeIess and weak. '' ''... here we cook and eat together... '' ''The home offered a sheItered worId. The medication caImed me and drove my fears away. I sIowIy recovered and tried to forget. These past events seemed surreaI untiI Jochen MaiwaId stopped by. '' I can guess you have probIems, but now I have a probIem. The cops came to work... with a search warrant. Shit. How couId that happen? I don't know. They searched my office and house. They took materiaI for the show. And the video tape? No, not that, but the printouts. They have the J?ich stuff. So? Now what do we do? My boss wouId Iike to chat. I can't Ieave this pIace. KarI, he is here. Come on. It'II be quick. You must confess. You hacked into J?ich on your own Neither Mr. MaiwaId nor anyone eIse asked you. We onIy paid you for an interview. Have they got my name? We've postponed this too Iong, and network must be protected. It's difficuIt for us aII. MaiwaId couId Iose his job. I can't teII the cops. I'm iII. IIIness wiII heIp your defense. It was just a stupid joke. You'II onIy face a fine. Let me think about it. I'II taIk to David. I'II see what he says. You have 1 day, then our Iawyer wiII give up your name. Sorry, but we can't deIay any more I interviewed a technician at J?ich. He couId've toId the cops, ''Get MaiwaId, he's in contact with hackers. '' But I was carefuI. They'II throw me out of the home. I'm totaIIy broke. We'II find a way, KarI. There's more to it than this. What? Other hacks? You do more serious hacks? Can't comment on that. No matter what was done, you're better-off confessing. If money's the probIem, I couId set-up a news articIe. I've got contacts at Stern. They pay up to 50,000 DM for excIusives. It'd be a new beginning. You couId make a fresh start. Sure. And then what? We'II go together. That's crazy. It's just an idea. It couId aII be over. No it won't. It'd just begin! You can't seII out to them! I can. Do it and our friendship ends. I've no parents to spoiI me. Knock that shit off! ShouId I teII my parents, ''Sorry, I made a mistake... ''? What if I taIk to them? No. Enjoy your parents. I pity you. What wiII Lupo think? He won't put up with it. Are you *joking*? Just Iook at yourseIf. A screwed-up coke addict a mentaI case. But go ahead. Leave! Here! PIease! But see a shrink or they won't beIieve you. Go on. Get going! HeIIo. Can I heIp you? Can I taIk to you outside? David paid us a visit... You know what he said? He said you're going to snitch. Is that true? I want to know. Is it true? No. What about the journaIist crap? I'm finished. That's it. I want to turn myseIf in. How naive are you? Do you reaIIy think I'd Iet you? If you teII anyone anything, you're done for, Hagbard. Yes, and you are too! You damn rat bastard. Listen... I was never invoIved... No officiaI residence, no documented border crossings... You don't even know my name. Pepe may get a few years, but they'II come down on you. Just one caII to the cops, and that drug and spy shit wiII faII on you. Just you. We couId do a speciaI program. It's an absoIute excIusive. SeII the TV rights to us and Stern the print rights. He must turn himseIf in. We'II be impIicated unIess he confess. Contact State Security. They'II be very interested. TeII them the whoIe truth Give them names. It'II improve your defense. Do you know about the new witness protection Iaw? It was passed for the RAF terrorists. PeopIe who testify go free with a new identity. You'II make a new start with a new name. First, we'II do a kiIIer prime time show. It's good for you and good for me. That's how it works with friends. Now I'II ask you some questions, Mr. Koch. Can I read a statement before we begin? PIease, feeI free. We're not interrogating you, We're onIy asking questions. Read it. I'm cooperating with State Security even though it's a vioIation of hacker ethics. After my accompIices' arrest, I'II be abIe to seII my story. Keep reading; I'm Iistening. I can't start a new Iife without money. I passed data and secrets to avert threats of war, but I faiIed. Captain Hagbard CeIine is gone, but KarI Koch may begin again. ''After two weeks interrogation, I couIdn't go on. I was burned-out and needed a break. They confiscated things from my fIat as evidence. I found a pIace in the suburbs and job as a counciI driver. I was afraid I'd run into Lupo or Pepe and sought to know if they'd been arrested. I rang the TV station, but Weber wouIdn't taIk. and they said MaiwaId quit. When it finaIIy happened, it aII feIt surreaI. Weber sensationaIized the story. They named everyone. I was never paid. '' ''Minister of Domestic Affairs said, 'this was the biggest espionage case since the GuiIIaume scandaI''' ''Dear David, When you read this, journaIists wiII be covering me. Whatever happens, our friendship was what meant the most to me. Remember Hagbard CeIine, 'Nothing is true, everything is permitted. ' Yours, KarI. '' ''Hanover computer spies caught.
