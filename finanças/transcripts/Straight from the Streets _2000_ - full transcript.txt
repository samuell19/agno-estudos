Yo nigga you better know motherfucker scatter or motherfucker's I assaulted and battered. Niggas getting pistol whipped to what my big ass free for all a big ballroom brawl.

I don't give a fuck about dying because I fight for my rights day and night trying to unite for this motherfucking riot. And I'm inciting God damn it. - Yeah, that's a rap man. It's the truth right on rapping is what's on your mind. White people were trying to censor some stuff all the time. You know, they don't want to hear reality. I don't wanna hear the dark side. And that's what we represent. The dark side. Dark side is the extreme reality. They're all points of the society. So, you know, go got the suburbs. It's still on here to there.

That's going to fuck you up in your backyard in your back yard. You know what I'm saying? Far looking at other countries, here You know what I'm saying?

(Police siren) - [Man] Gutted shells of buildings, flames raging out of control and an atmosphere of apprehension. Still hover over the quieting white section of Los Angeles here for successive days and nights, mostly on the nights. The long hot summer had erupted into violence. Powerless against snipers, looters, and arsonists operating in the dark, police and national guardsman had tried mostly to confine the disorder to the 42 square miles of this area. But as the outbreaks abated here, they started up in other communities. Although Watts is a predominantly Negro community there seemed to be no elements of racial protest and the uprisings. Rather they seem to be riots without cause the fire damage alone is estimated that more than $175 million. (dramatic music) Even after order is restored the police and 15,000 national guardsman virtually the state's entire force remain on duty. Now the guards and police must see that food markets are reopened. Electricity, restored refuse, collected. All the steps that must be taken in a city We're recorded. - [Man] What else Two, three KJLH Rico and the radio it's Sunday oldies with a little twist as we kind of rebuild the community, working together. As I see all my brothers and sisters of all ethnic persuasions ages sizes, just out there working together. So everybody knows what's happening and that's why the world is reaching out. We've had people from Japan We have people from New York not only in the ERN, we've had people from Britain. We've had the BBC here. We've had people from across the United States, listening in tuning, in watching to hear and see what's happening. And now they know not only will things get better in Los Angeles. This is my prediction. They'll get better around the world because they can see these same tensions and problems and pressures are happening. Not just here, they're happening around the world. - We have to lobby. We have to get together as a group of people like other people do like the Irish do the Jewish people do, they go to Washington and they show themselves in numbers and they pressure the government to make changes. I think we're going to have to do that. The way that we have done that so far is by burning down buildings, by taking it out on each other. I think that we have to redirect that energy to something positive and take it to Washington. - The national guard, they got to move like robots. You know, they go move on us like robots Their attitude is you know, hard and then they go shoot this brothers out there. It looks, they right from the hoods who I came down here. Me and my homies was listening to the radio all day. And we were listening to the people, voice their opinions. I've been trying to call in for a couple of days. But then I, Denzel Washington got on and he gave a pledge some money to try to rebuild this for 10 years, myself, people like Ice Cube, public enemy, and predicted the situation. And we've been shut off by the radio stations in the media you know, as being just black kids yelling you know, we yelled about police brutality. We yelled about the gang situation. Me, myself personally I just unhappy with the focus of the anger. You know what I'm saying? I personally would like to float some fucking police stations up. You know what I'm saying? And if it was up to me, I'd burned the white house down, you know? Cause I'm a, I'm an anarchist. I'm ready to do this shit, but this is it. This ain't helping what we're doing to ourselves. This ain't helping and in my angle is not what we might be considered a positive one. But the way America deals with problems is violence. You know, when they have a problem in the Persian Gulf, they do violence in Canada. They use violence. I do not want to see no brothers die but I know one thing that the national guard started crossing down here, these brothers ain't going, ain't backing up. You know what I'm saying? And it could get bloody. But Bush, ain't gonna do nothing for pacify us. He gonna pacify us. He going divide us. He gonna turn around and tell the Koreans, see what the black people did to you. And you gonna turn around and tell the white people. This look at the savages on TV. He's going to separate us once again. You know, we have to be very intelligent. There's white people right here, there's white people down there cleaning up, you know, it's black folks. We can't, we gotta pick our allies and tie in with them. If we can all get together, they can't fuck with us. If the blacks and Hispanics and Asians and white people get together the people that are really down with this they can't fuck with us. We've proven that right now. - [Man] So we are witnessing the social disintegration of America. Have you ever stop to ask yourself why Mexican or Chicano brothers and sisters and the Blacks killing each other? Why is that happening? Do our brothers in the Chicano community benefit? Back to the blacks, do we benefit? Who benefits? You better put the damn gun down, and you better get your head on, right?

They ready to work, they got their minds on the right track, but if you get outta the pen and you ain't got nothing for me I might as well go back to the pen. You ain't got nothing for me. We wanna run our own program, we got the power in Watts. We wanna write our own program. I can train everybody in here. We can make some money, put them to work. I'm telling you, we put ourselves to work we don't need nobody to come down here with an already program to tell us how to run our project. No more of that. We have to start putting up.

That's why we really formed hands across watts but no other organization was doing what we was doing. - Right now. I'd like to bring up Tony to say a few words Mr. Tony Thomas, from hands across Watts. (crowd clapping) - I'd just like to say from being a gang member and being an active in gang activity a couple of years ago and see myself now, I mean I didn't think the transformation could have ever could have happened but as I look now and working with the Kedren community center Kitty, Mr. O, Diamond all the other brothers within the gangs and bloods and Crips and putting them together for peace. I mean, I feel happy. - [Man] Oh Bogart. Tell me about, is the truce for real or what? - Almost definitely the truth is we, I mean we, right here in the projects where the truce started and the truce is real. It is going on right now. You could see when you look at the truce the truce is not, no little kind of word. And then the truce is a movement of black people coming together for peace and trying trying to build an economic structure for the black people. And that's what the truce is all about. You know, bloods and Crips layin' down the gun for peace. I mean, you go back here to 1989 as bad as we were gang bang the killer. It was a lot of innocent. People got killed. And as it got going on, then the rebellion came about it really woke a lot of people up, to what we really was doing it. What was really going on. And we say, no, no more.

You know, a lot of people don't like that. You probably edit that part out. But you know, Minister Farrakhan is the father that that I never knew. So it's like that. Now I'm a member of the Nation of Islam and that is my definite inspiration influence and success. And it's not about a title or a label or nothing like that. You know, it's just knowledge. It's just reason, you know? So whatever you want to call it, you know, truthism. You know, that's what it's about reality. We don't, believe in spooks in this sky and some you know, little man with horns under the ground or heaven and hell exists right here. And our mind, you know, the condition of life that you know, that we live. When it seemed like nobody else cared everybody else turned up their nose and walked by us. You know, the Muslim was the only one who would get in the dirt with us and, you know, suffer with us and show any kind of compassion or interest or concern. Cause you know, the war, our trip to America you know, we was thoroughly robbed of a knowledge of ourself or religion, the culture, God, everything that you know that you hear the Nation of Islam, you know, talking about at this time, because right now we've been exploited and oppressed through our ignorance due to our lack of knowledge we being destroyed. So, you know, it's just that it's not about coming together against white people or coming against against anybody else. It's it's about self-improvement, you know what I'm saying? The revolution goes on here. You know, it's not going on out there. It starts in the brain you know, improving your own personal conditions.

You could do all this stuff. You hit people up but you battle them, have competition rather than fighting. And it's better off like that. (upbeat music) - Some teachers, they don't respect graffiti because, it's not time. Like, the art they know and I respect it is art is art. Like they think their art is better because they went to school for it. And they have a degree in a paper that says they're artists. For me you know, I learned mine from the street and it's all in my head. All in my imagination. So I didn't have anybody teaching me. I just did whatever came to my mind and put it on paper. I think you should respect it more. (upbeat music) - Rap music that's where my heart's at man. That's the music that makes me want to do music. A lot of different races of people are doing hip hop now and you know, MCs and just black kids or Spanish kids no more, you know, they're coming in all kinds of different sizes and packages you know, it's just, it's an art form, it's a music form. And wherever they do music, wherever they do rap, I don't care if it's in Europe or China, wherever that's because it's being accepted as that music form on a whole, you know, it's as large as rock and roll.

First of all we're Spanish kids, you know, a lot of Spanish area. And we have a lot of different views than a lot of the groups from South central and stuff like that.

Being in there with some real gangsters, some real individuals who put me up on game and let me know that this talent that I had was worth doing something good or trying to do something with to elevate myself, to not want to become a statistic in be a penitentiary number but be a, a real statistic. Something that's moving, something that's going in history books and move something on a whole, as a black man. It's real gangster. You know what I'm saying? I want to specify that a gangster is not a gang member a gangster's one who moves and put something back, and it's about intellect and getting somewhere in life, as an individual, not as a follower, but as a leader you learn things in the weirdest places, and I learned my biggest lesson in the County jail. The jail house has a hidden university Cause you got a lot of brothers who get in there and get that first opportunity on getting any knowledge on school. You know what I'm saying? Because you don't have to pay for it in there, but out here on the streets, you gotta pay for knowledge. It ain't like a brother with a 4.0 GPA can just walk into UCLA and, and get a college degree. You got to have money to back you up. Cause you gotta pay for the supplies. So it's like, it's a lot out there and make you feel like, well, I'm going to stay in school. I'ma graduate. I'm gonna do something with my life. When I get out of school, everything gonna be all right. But it comes finances and then they taking half of that with taxes so it's like, this world is something else. And then you wonder why there's more black men in the penitentiary than there is in college because it's easier to go to the pen. You don't have to pay to go to the pen but you gotta pay to go to college, that's easy. Family's going to give up on you the first two years you locked down. If you're doing 30, what do you expect them to do? Life is hard on the streets. You can't expect them to take care of you. You a grown man. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, and then the three strike rule. They going back in your juvenile record and counting those up Pete Wilson is doing it. What's worse is they doing it to us, man, I tell you, I see a lot happening on the positive side for the simple fact that people like myself plan on getting that people inside the game who have juice and know how to articulate plans to move something and get something back. - [Man] The Dogg Pound is men and some women who came together to help each other man, we ain't no gangs, We ain't all that, you know what I mean? We just a group of people that's trying to survive man. We putting together business ways when you're 40 and 50 years old, you know what I'm saying? We just like any group of people come together to help each other. We represent surviving and struggling. Each of us came from a different area. Each of us came from a different situation. You know what I mean? All of us came together and made something for ourselves, me and Snoopy met, we met from opposite sides and look what we put together, so we basically represent getting ourselves and the people who's involved in us up in a position that's similar to us. (man laughing) - [Man] How does it feel to be the only female rap artist on death row records? - It's cool, I mean, it's no big deal. I'm sure others are going to come, but I'm in a position where I'm still, I started with a company that we all started off together and each person is going fall into their own rank and get their own props. So I'm glad that the recognition that I got from being on death row came when it did because if I wasn't on death row I would still be recognized cause I was still get mine but I believe being with them just made it even, more. Because you know, they're hot and everybody that's on the label's hot.

It's a way to vent rage. Cause right now this is Robin and I'm not performing. So I'm not rage right now but that's when rage comes out and she gets to vent all her anger on the mic and release herself. So rap music is a form for rage to release all her anger.

If you got that footage then you already know - [Man] I got it. - If not to make a shot. My defense was great. - [Man] These rappers, calling a woman, bitches and hoes? - Well there are bitches and hoes out there. And I feel that they are talking to those bitches and whores that are out there. But when they approach with women as throwing themselves on them or coming just want to come over at three or four in the morning or something, you know what, what are you trying? What are you really want? What do you want? You want me to have sex with you? So later on you can say, I raped you and maybe take me to jail or you want to have sex with me and try me try to get you pregnant so you can get a paternity suit and try to just get me, you know, it's people like that. And people just act like it doesn't even go on, but you know, I'm not offended by it. I think it's getting out of hand. I think a lot of people are doing it because that seems to be the thing now. All women are bitches or blah, blah, blah. But I think enough is enough. I'm not saying that they are, when they talk about bitches that they're talking about all women. Cause I don't believe that, but I do believe it's like, okay, enough already. Let's see what else you can talk about. You got skills. Let's see let's here to lyrics. You know, don't shoot nobody don't fuck a bitch. Don't whatever don't set trip. But see what you really got on the mic. (upbeat music) - I call them like, I've seen somebody come to me like a sister. I say sister, that's it. Somebody come to me like a lady. I say, ma'am, this or this, you come to me the wrong way. Then you're going to be called one of your mother nouns. (upbeat music) I'm not even going to justify what we do because we just products of the system. We, don't have no power. We have no power. We are just like a vacuum. We just suck in everything. You know, we learned from our parents and we learned from the world and the world is very sexist. Do you go, you go inside the Raiders locker room and hear what they talking about. You go inside the Raiders front office and hear what they talking about. And you go inside the front office IBM. And he how the men and there talk about women - [Woman] On the issue of moral social responsibility or is it the bottom line? The dollar raps proliferation in the marketplace has produced star status for many of its performers. Daddy O you're my co-host for this segment. - I think a moral and social responsibility. It goes without saying, I think rap and the rap community and making rap records, just the ideology of making a rap record period is a moral responsibility. Now on every block it's a DJ, it's a rapper, it's a kid getting a deal. I seen kids that became rappers changed their mother's life. You know where, you know, daddy didn't do it. The government didn't do it. You know what I'm saying? But, so I think that it goes without saying, you know, not to mention all of the messages and just, you know the numerous things that we've done for the consciousness of young black people, since we started making records. (upbeat music) - [Man] There's was always something to do here, you know? And you get them, you can like, you know, cool down. You can play some ball, you know, shoot some hoop you know, kick back, you know simple little sip, a little crooked eye, ice cooler. wit your boy, you know, it, ain't gotta be liquor. It's a lot of things to do. But the reality is that most of us all we know is to get a 40 kick it with the homies and look for something to get into. You know what I'm saying? So my thing is this if there are in fact more things to do as far as music, as far as sports you know what I'm saying? Then I think that everybody should get in that. But the reality is that it ain't that many outlets for people hear. Rap music is my voice. That's my medium of speaking to my peoples. You know what I'm saying? You know, putting it on CD and giving them the real. You know, giving them what, what I get from them. You know, it's a cycle you know, once you lose that cycle was over and rap music. Ain't nothing but a form of communication baby. It's just going to continue to get stronger and become more controversial as it seems because people got so much more to say, and everybody's trying to be politically correct. You know, but you can't stop me from saying what I want to say. It's the IN thing now to be against gangster rap music, it's the IN thing. So you get a lot of people, Hey, Bob Dole, you get you know, peckerwoods like him. They want it. You know try to govern what we, you know, what's going on over here. He don't know nothing about what's going on over here. So what they need to recognize and understand that there's going to always be an outlet for the ghetto. It's going to always be an inlet too. And it's only open to a chosen few, you know what I'm saying? And we will have other ways to communicate. And if we can't sell our records in the warehouse and in tower and in Virgin, Megastores the word would still get around baby. Cause I started on the underground and I will finish on the underground. That's why words like poverty. Ain't no big word to me. I know what it's like to be broke. You know, they, ain't no big deal. They ain't gonna hurt me. If I, you know I can't push a lexus and, and wear a Movado and a gold chain you know, around my neck, ain't no big deal. Hey, you know, so I know what it's like and I still get my hustle and my smash on regardless. If I ain't got white dollars as they say I ain't going to be using the terms.

I think his name's Schwarzkopf or whatever's, you know, he's a hero. He's wrote books on his violence. He was a big star on all the violence that he was able to get other people to do. You know what I'm saying? He's killed way more people than allegedly Snoop doggy dogg. So who's violent and who, and he's a hero you know, they want to, he ran for president. I think he'd become president, cause they look at him here. He, you know, he's the man, he's the killing machine man. When you sit back man and send your missiles. Into the capital, you know, you saying you're missile sit back and just launch everything you got into Baghdad how many people got killed there and you you're going to sit there and tell me all those bombings were military strategic targets. You know, You think we must have been fools basically. And he's more to me, more of a punk because he sits in his office or wherever he is and make strategies and use the poor to go out there and lay the bodies on the line. You know what I'm saying so. You can't blame the child. For being violent without going to the parents. You know what I'm saying so don't come to us talking about how violent society is and are we are we a promoting that you go to the top, you know. Colin Powell promoting is a Bush promoting is Clinton promoting hell yeah they are. Why do kids look at the rappers as leaders is because we tell them the truth. So now that we have their ear should we stop telling them the truth? Which got us to the position that we're in now, should we start saying there is a Santa Claus. So when the kid grows up and there's no Santa Claus, he looks at you like you a fool. And he don't even want to hear what you got to say after that, after you pumped that type of lie. I mean, these things destroy kids on trying to say the world is a perfect place and you're supposed to love everybody and things. Yeah, but it's not really like that. So let me tell you how it really is. And when we tell them how it really is everybody want to lash out at us. - Have patience with us and you'll see the change.

When we bring these things up to the surface and we hold the mirror to that idea of holding the mirror is for us to correct our problems. I think that's what we doing now. And I think that we're going to continue to do it. And I think it's going to steam roll to these words. And this language is not even acceptable in the community no more. And I mean not using the community no more. And the rapper you will see in years to come, that the rappers won't use it. The ones we make up in our mind that's not the way the to roll. (upbeat music) (Crowd cheering) - A quote from Don Cornelius. Who's the host of the TV show, Soul Train. He had suggested in our last hearing and sort of advocated a more stringent system of record label. - [Voice On Speaker] I could buy any recording artists which are violently or sexually explicit or with promote illegal drug or firearm use or any other antisocial behavior should be clearly marked and identify as X-rated. - Well, that was Don Cornelius the producer of Soul Train. I know everybody knows that voice. He who old train. He also testified before that congressional subcommittee - [Man] See, they always get it. Black men, they get to attack black man. You know, they used to attack us and now they made themselves invisible. And now we attack each other because we have no love for ourselves. And when somebody like that, who's made all his money off the black community. I mean the brothers, your brothers as doing time, they count their time on soul trains. You know they like how many soul trains you got till you get out? You know what I'm saying? And for him to get up there and say something like that to them, Wolves, you know what I'm saying? To me it's terrible. You know we didn't put all the money all the dollars before you got white folks on soul train. It wasn't nothing but Afros on there. So, you know, we didn't gave him all his money you know, and he didn't have a Snoop doggy dogg on his show. So what is he talking about? - Is it not possible that the radio and the record industry and the RIAA couldn't work together and just sanitize all of it? - [Man] It didn't want us to get a chance to get on this. You know these microphones and say, you know, what's really going on because we've been, you know, totally dehumanized and thoroughly robbed at the knowledge of ourselves. And some of us now are getting it back. And we were going to die talking. - Knowledge to me, means everything. That means the whole meaning of being born, and the person coming to this world. And doesn't have any knowledge by the time they leave this earth, then to me their life is void. They didn't learn anything from not as the key to everything, knowledge about a tree knowledge about grass, air, everything is everything to be known is knowledge. You got to have the knowledge not to wear the wrong color in the wrong neighborhood. You'll get shot up. You have to have knowledge of how not to move your hands. Certain ways of thought certain gang sides. You've got that knowledge of how to say certain words the way you're talking and stuff. Even though you got to have the knowledge of all that certain streets certain areas, certain graffiti on the wall and you ride by, you see some initials or something. You got to know what that mean. You know it's a lot to stay alive, just like the African Plains. There's so many different animals you know, wilderbeasts, lions and all of that. So you just got to know where to go where not to go, where you might become prey. You rather go where you're predator. Instead of being prey. My people been tortured and been mutilated, they used to take pregnant women and hang them upside down by their ankles who were pregnant and slice that belly open letting that unborn fetus spill out to the ground while white men take they boots and stuff that unborn shot into the ground. That's an autobiography of Malcolm X. They used to breed fear into that unborn black child by having the pregnant mother sit up and watch the husband be killed tie onto this horse on this horse or leg and a leg and shoot off a shotgun. And four horses were going four different directions and watched the man be split up and they hold the woman's face and make her watch. So all that fear stressing the brain into that unborn child.

You know, once we get, you know, once we get up against the gate, it's kind of like, you know, you have a sister or brother you might hate them till somebody else come along and attack and then y'all become a family And I think that's what's happening now, you know we have Tupac in the media and you have Snoop in the media and everybody wants to attack them on the things that's happening in their personal lives. And you got everybody coming to their defense right now. - Rap music represents the voice of, you know, black youth or black people in America. And we speak you know, for the people who can't speak, people who got jobs and they don't want to lose their job they've got families to feed and they can't say what they really feel, you know, about the system or whatever.

We all know Tony because he took his natural talent and turned it into something that people marveled at. - He was not supposed to be a leader. He was supposed to have come from circumstances that could not allow him to emerge. Commanding the attention of the press commanding the attention of a political leaders. Commanding the attention of community leaders. We cannot afford to lose one more. The business of peace and unity has got to be our business. We've all got to do what we can to embrace somebody.

It wasn't the outside that didn't, wasn't down as well as Ice T said that wasn't down about truce it wasn't one of him, brothers. It was a brother from the hood. - [Ice T] When I met Tony and the brothers and PJ, he was so real. He was like yo. He was adamant about peace. He was leaving. He reversed gang banging. And then he was like turning into aggressive in the opposite direction. (somber music) - Like this is gotta be one of the most terrible things that happened in LA ever.
