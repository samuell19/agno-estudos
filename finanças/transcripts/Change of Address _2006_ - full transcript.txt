CHANGE OF ADDRESS Excuse me. ls that ad for you? Yes, why? l just wanted to know. lt could be for someone else. Thanks. Good-bye. Good-bye. Excuse me again. lt's a bit delicate. l've a friend who needs a roommate to share the rent. Are you interested? Sure, yes. His flat is really nice. Have you got a minute? Yes. He's abroad. l have the key. We can visit, it's not far. The living room... There's the bath area. Maybe the owner will make a bathroom of it but it's fine as it is. This is the room to rent. l slept in it once. It's very comfortable. So, do you like it? Yes, a lot. l like it, too. Some people find it too open but that's what l like about it. Are you interested, then? Yes. However before l introduce you to the tenant, l must know more about you so l can persuade her. l'd be glad to recommend you. You look a nice chap. What can l say? Tell me about yourself. ln terms of payment, you can say l have a part-time job but l should be able to find more work. l hope to give private lessons. - l've put up ads. - What kind? French horn. - Horn lessons? - Yes. What's that? l teach French horn. l play the French horn. Horn? l'm a professional. l came to Paris to find work in orchestras. You're a musician? Yes. That's really good. Ah! Good. My friend will like that. He likes horn? Yes, l believe he does. What's it like, then? All horns are identical but they're not alike. What's yours like? Well, it's... it's... lt's best if l show it to you. l'd love that. lt's not bad. l'm rather proud of it. My colleagues are jealous. But what can l say to really reassure your friend? Let me think... No, l've heard enough. It's quite sufficient. Would we get along? Oh, yes! You know, he's very... He's very... Look, l must confess something. None of my friends want a roommate. l lied. Oh? lt was to see if l liked you. l shared this place with a friend, but she had to leave. l like it here but the rent's too high. l was putting up an ad when l saw you. So... my name is Anne. l'm David. To our first evening! That's very pretty. lt's my mother. What do you do for a living? l have my own copy shop. How's business? l'd like more business but l'm hopeful. Everyone needs photocopies. - Do you like it? - A lot. l invested in 9 machines. 6 colour laser copiers, 2 black-and-white and even a digital one. And it's never routine. l meet lecturers accountants, hairdressers... All kinds! l once even met a... Thanks! That's enough. To us! l forgot! l haven't seen your horn. - Shall l get it? - Please! lt's lovely! l've never seen one so close. You want to hold it? l'd rather look at it. l might damage it. Can you play something? lt gave me a shiver. Look. l can't see anything. Sit here, then. It goes before you look. Look... There, it's gone. l only give you a short shiver. Don't be disappointed. It's because l've had a drink. lt's a scientific fact. A shiver is an icy draught on the skin. Alcohol warms the blood and the shiver goes. Want some more? Yes. - It's all gone. - Never mind. l don't drink much so l have nothing in. - Do you like to drink? - Yes. Occasionally. Good. Then we can drink together. - You know what? - No. l'm glad you're here. l'm glad too. That makes two of us, then. lsn't it time for bed? Yes... l don't want to hurry you. No, that's OK. We can wait a bit. As you wish. No, as you wish. No, but... What are you doing? Well, l, er... l don't know what came over me. l felt like kissing you. That's a bother. l'm sorry. No, l'm sorry. l do want to please you but l already have someone. l'm sorry, l didn't know. No, it's my fault. l forgot to tell you. Silly me! l haven't hurt you too much? No, not at all. Be honest. You haven't fallen in love with me? Not at all! To be honest, l don't know what came over me. lt must be the alcohol. Great! That means we can still live together. Do sit down. Shall we begin? Oh, no! lt's for my daughter. She really worries me. She's so studious. l don't understand her. You know what? She never goes out. l never see her smile or have fun. She never brings a boy home. Or a girl - l'm easy. At her age, l'd remarried. How old is she? 19. She looks sad but she's never wanted for a thing. l called you because l thought these lessons might amuse her. l played the horn for several years. l loved it. That's her now. l hope she likes you. Julia! This is David the horn teacher l told you about. Hello. You've never had any lessons? OK, l'll quickly run over the instrument. This is the mouthpiece where you put your lips. The right hand goes inside the bell to hold the instrument. The left hand goes here and presses valves. Like this. l'll show you how to hold it. It's best if you try it... My button's stuck. Sorry, this has never happened to me. Do you mind holding it? l'll take of my jacket, it'll be... Try this. Excuse me. Hang on, l'll get it. l've got it. Don't worry, it always takes time at first. lt takes some people 3 or 4 lessons to make a sound. The main thing is to blow from the stomach and to purse your lips. l knew you'd do it. Same time for the next lesson? Listen, l was thinking... Did your man react badly when you said you were living with a man? - l haven't told him. - Why? - We're not talking. - You've fallen out? Not at all. We haven't had chance to speak. How did you meet? We haven't really met. Our paths have crossed. He comes in for photocopies. His eyes are so soft, so sad. He looks like an angel. You see l'm not particularly shy, but... when l see him, l clam up. lt's the same with him. He can't speak, either. l just pray he'll write a cheque. A cheque? So l get his name and address! Anne... l must tell you... l think l'm in love. David, you know you shouldn't. l'm very touched. No, not you. It's a student of mine. As soon as l saw her... l'm so pleased! - We'll both be happy. - Weren't we already? We'll be happier. ls she in love with you, too? l don't know yet. It's hard to tell. She's rather shy. But l think l can feel something between us. So she must feel something for me. l understand. You don't have to explain. We're now psychologically equal. lt must seem expensive, but it's beautiful. Very beautiful. When l started out mine wasn't as good!. lt was good enough but you can go a long, long way with that horn. You could even... l wanted to say... Maybe some time we could go for a drink and... have a chat. You know get to know one another. So if ever you have time... Because it can be good for a teacher and student to... Because of the music... but it's up to you, of course. Some time... Do you have time? Anyway, just out of curiosity, does my teaching method suit you? l'm not too strict? l know l can be overbearing... But l'm sure you'll progress fast. l like teaching people like you. Thank you. Call me David. You can. l want us to treat each other as equals. l don't notice the age difference. And l don't like the teacher-student hierarchy. lt makes me uneasy. l prefer complicity to obedience. Unless you don't want to... or you don't feel sufficiently like-minded. Is that it? So you'll call me David? - Got the time, David? - Great! You can do it. Time, David? That's even better. No, really. What's the time? lt's... 4.15. l have to go and work. Yes, l've got lots of work too. No, it's on me. My treat. Thanks. Thanks. What do you study? l'm preparing for veterinary college. l love animals too. l'd like a dog, but in town... l don't like pets. l only like wild animals. - How are you? - Great. My uncle gave me the last three exam papers. They're at home if you're interested. l have to be going. Good-bye, then. - l was waiting for you! - Why? l hate drinking alone. - Who are we toasting? - Me! l saw him! And we talked! Exactly 3 hours and 24 minutes ago. Him? Your...? Yes. His name's Gabriel. How did it go? lndescribable! l've not read enough novels to find the words. But l have to tell you. Everything l tell you from now on will be a pale reflection of reality. l was alone in the shop when l saw him come in. He comes over to me. Says he wants some photocopies. l say he can use number 3. And he says.. ''Thank you''. And l just blurt out.. ''You want a hand?'' He says.. ''Yes''. So we both went to machine number 3. lnstead of standing next to me, he stood behind me, up against me, like this. And then my heart was beating so fast l couldn't do or say anything. All of a sudden, he says.. ''l like your perfume''. l say ''l'm not wearing any, it must be my shampoo.'' And then... he started laughing. l had a good idea and laughed along. Our conversation became natural just like old friends. Did you kiss? No. He's not the kind of guy who kisses girlsj ust like that. He looks romantic. - When's the dinner? - In 2 months. 2 months? He's of to Asia for research. He'll call when he gets back. Research into what? Comparative languages. Just think! l didn't dare ask what it was. l pretended to know. Do you know? l suppose he compares languages. That's what l thought. But what's the point? Maybe if you had to choose the best language of all, he'd know since he's studied them. Lucky he's around, then! - Am l disturbing you? - No. Can you make room? Yes. - Sorry. - What about? l just talked about me. lt's natural. lt's not. You saw Julia today. l didn't even ask about it. Very well. Make any progress? A little. We're on first-name terms now. Good. Are you pleased? Actually, l'm very worried she'll fall for a boy her age. l feel like l'm her father. l'm jealous of every boy l see and view him as a threat. You said she didn't go out with boys. Yes, but you never know. She walks to class she takes the bus, she sees people. l can't help thinking of the Asian girls Gabriel will see. There are a lot in Asia! l trust him, of course but you can't help thinking about it. You dream of love but you forget that it hurts. You never feel as alone as when you're in love. lf l could hug her, l'd be the happiest of men. All l want is to lay my head on his shoulder, like this. All l want is to hold her hand, like this. Just to breathe his smell. Just put my head on hers. Just feel the heat of his body. Just put my lips on hers. Oh, yes, his mouth! l'm sorry. No, l'm the one who's sorry. lt won't happen again. l promise it won't either. Don't get me wrong. My eyes were closed and l thought of him. And l thought of her. lt was so good. Yes, it was so wonderful. lf you were thinking of her and me of him, we didn't cheat. l quite agree. No need to feel guilty. Not for thinking about them too much! Let's wipe it from our memories. l've already forgotten. Excuse me, l'm going now. Julia, there's plenty of food in. But if you want to come to the country, do. l think l'll stay and work. You're always working! Good-bye, David. Good-bye, ma'am. Shall we stop? l thought maybe we could go out for a drink... or take in an exhibition. l don't feel like going out. You've work to do? No, that's not it. l don't feel like going out. That's OK l've a lot of work on. Another time perhaps? Don't you want to have a drink here? Yes, why not? l do have a bit of free time. lt's very good. You can smoke. What about your mother? She's not here. Light me one. - You smoke? - No, but l feel like it. l hope that's not myfault. lt is. lf you start smoking, l'll feel guilty. Got an ashtray? - Just use that. - That? The other day, you said that being silent with someone made you uneasy. Do you feel uneasy with me now? Not with you. This is nice. l really want to kiss you. lsn't life magical at times? - l don't know. - You don't? What do you mean by ''magical''? Well, l mean great... wonderful, miraculous. Life's always miraculous, because you can't explain it. As one body decomposes, Iots of others are created. What's wrong? Don't you feel anything for me? l don't know. l love you, Julia. Like l never loved before. You're not angry? No, l understand. l was too abrupt. But l'll wait. However long it takes. Be honest. Was l too abrupt? No, you surprised her. So she had no feelings for me. That's not it. You can have subconscious feelings. You think so? Sure. She's never admitted it to herself. You said she was shy. So she lacks self-confidence. She meets an older man who's mature, gifted, intelligent, charming, but she doesn't dare imagine that he feels anything for her, maybe out of fear of rejection. So she ignores her feelings. So when she finds out he loves her she's very shocked. She's scared of being made fun of. She did seem embarrassed. l didn't know how to interpret it. What you say makes sense. l mean, she let me kiss her. She didn't push me away. l think your theory's right. Did she like the kiss? l don't know. She was passive. l couldn't French her. - That's a shame. - Why? lf she'd tasted one of your kisses, that would have been a plus. Damn, damn, damn, damn! What should l do now? l know. l'll wait. Wait. l know! She'll think you don't love her. Know what? My family has a seaside home. Take her there. We've never gone away together. lf she accepts, she'll accept all the rest. Funny, there's only one bed. lt's my first time here. No one told me. lt doesn't matter. Beautiful, isn't it? Had a good day? Me too. My bag! Police! Stop! - This is yours. - Thanks. You're welcome. - Thanks. - My pleasure. Lucky a police officer was there. l'm not a police officer. l said that to stop him. We were lucky you were there, though. Luckily l didn't find a tobacconist so l was able to help. l don't know how to thank you. l do. Buy me a drink. You won't feel indebted. And we can chat. l don't know any cafés open around here. Me neither. l'm not local. Nor are we. Sorry, there must be a bottle around here somewhere but l don't know where. My name's Julien. And you? Julia. Pretty name. It suits you. Thank you. l think a name is like jewellery. Some wear it well others not so well. And what do you do for a living? l'm preparing for veterinary college. You like animals? You see, l try not to forget that man is an animal, right? When man forgets that, he becomes stupid. We're animals getting to know one another. What are your 3 favourite animals? l don't know. The first you think of. The dolphin... The tortoise and... The tiger. - l see now. - What? ln fact, you'd like to be a dolphin. You're seen as a tortoise but you're really a tigress. Got it! l found it. l think it's rum. Want some? - Water for me. - Water? A toast to the future veterinarian! Lucky animals! And what do you do? l'm in business. The restaurant business. l opened a successful restaurant in NewYork. l've one opening in Paris soon. Funny, my uncle has a restaurant in the south-west. l came here to headhunt a good chef. You live in NewYork or Paris? Between the two. Somewhere in the Atlantic! l'd like to settle down and come back to Paris more often. - Where do you live? - Paris. Do you often go away together? Well, we're not... Oh, you're not...? Well, in fact... er... l mean... l thought you were. l'll have another drop. - Headache? - No, l'm OK. - Feel better? - Yes, thanks. You're very tense. - You often get massaged? - Never. Never? Massages are important. They're very relaxing. Excuse me, l'm tired. l think l'll turn in soon. No, l'm sorry. l'll be going. l'll leave you to sleep. Oh, l've had too much to drink. l'd better drive carefully. You're going to drive? Yes, l was on my way back to Paris. lsn't that dangerous? lt's not very sensible. l won't find a hotel now. l'll wait for it to wear of. But l don't want to intrude. No... Well, David? Well, the thing is... No, no... That's OK. Thanks. Let's carry on, then. You don't mind? No. On the contrary, in fact. lf l ever need a massage, maybe you could give me one. l'll go for a walk. - Enjoy your walk. - Yeah. Are you OK? Excuse me l've got a plane to catch. See you soon! Hi. What do you want to do today? Whatever you like. What would you like? What's wrong? You're so sweet to me. You should be angry. - Why? - You know why. There's no need to cry. It's not your fault. Feelings come unbidden. Do you have feelings for him or is it just a passing fancy? l love him. l love him... Don't cry if you're in love. lt's not because l'm sad. lt's because l'm happy. You OK? Sure? He called me. He's back? Yes. He said l was the first he called. After his mother and his research director. He'd thought about me throughout the trip and wished he had my address to write to me every day. l can hardly believe it. l was scared l was fooling myself, indulging in pipe dreams. When are you seeing him? Once his fever's gone. His fever doesn't bother me but he insists. So l'll wait. How was your weekend? l'm going to bed. l just wanted to say good night. Mind you, l doubt it will be. l'm sorry l was so happy today. l feel sad for you, too. When l think about me, l'm happy. When l think about you, l'm sad. Thing is, you say this or that but you can be happy yet sad. You need to take your mind of things. Maybe l can help you. Go on. Low down... - Tell me if this is all right. - OK. You cheat! l'm not playing with you! That's it! No more! What are you doing? - It's a gift. - For me? What is it? - What do you think? - Don't know. Oh, a CD. No, you're not disturbing me. No, l wasn't asleep. Yes, tomorrow. OK. Gabriel's taking me to dinner tomorrow! How was dinner? Wonderful. The food? Delicious. And the conversation? Fascinating. Did he take you for a drink afterwards? Did you kiss? No, he's not keen. Not keen on girls? Oh, yes, but he doesn't like kissing. lsn't that a problem? No, we still made love. So it went well. Everything's OK. No. You said it went well. That doesn't mean everything's OK. What's wrong? l don't know when l'll see him again. ls he going away again? No, l'm the problem. l'm so impatient. l miss him already. So many people sleep together. Why can't we? Hello, how are you? Fine, and you? Fine. It's been a while. Why did you stop Julia's lessons? l was waiting for her to call me. l see. She's not very well, you know. Oh? What's wrong with her? l don't know. She won't tell me. She's so withdrawn. Her schoolwork's suffering. Could you call in on her? You got along well. She'd like that. lt's because of Julien? Have you split up? Did he treat you badly? So what's wrong? He still hasn't called. Since that weekend, you mean? Why don't you call him? l don't have his number. He was in such a hurry, he just took my number. Maybe he noted it down wrong. What do you think? l don't know. What did you think of him? You must think l'm a fool to expect him to call. l'll never think you're a fool. Then if he's not a liar and he was telling the truth, when he said he loved me why hasn't he called? Maybe he had a car crash? Nothing very serious. Just his hands crushed. So, he can't use the phone. l don't know. Maybe you're right. Maybe he noted your number wrong. Come on. Make an effort. It'll do you good. Want to do something else? l've got Monopoly. You'll see, it's great. How about it? 3 months later Well? A kir, please. Same for me. There's alcohol in a kir. l know. You drink alcohol now? lt's my first time. l have to try one day. lt's best with you. lf l get lost, you'll help me. Let's drink to you! - We already did. - Let's do it again. And again. - You've been so good to me. - No! l really didn't deserve it. Don't say that. l didn't worry about you. Only me. And you consoled me. You even gave me hope. Maybe, but it didn't change anything. l'm starting to forget him. Really. Are you OK? Wait for me, l'll be right back. - What are you doing here? - Having a drink with you. l'm already with someone. Am l in the way? No, l didn't mean that... ls it a girl? l'm with Julia. ln this state? Here she comes. Julia, this is Anne. - Hi. - Hello. Anne's a friend. He's told me lots about you. l'm pleased to meet you. Another drink? Could we order, please? l'm sorry we're closing. Let's go home. There's Martini and white wine. l forgot to tell you. We share a flat. We're roommates but it's just to save on the rent. To David! Why me? lt makes me happy. Does it make you happy too? Excuse me. l'll be right back. l'm pleased to meet you. l said it before but l'm really glad. He told me so much about you. Only good things, don't worry! No one's told you about him, right? He's a really good guy. Come to think of it l've never been bored with him. l'd even say David is the ideal man to live with. When l say ''ideal man'', don't go thinking that... Don't imagine that me and him... l've found the grey sock you lost. Honestly! The heel's all worn. God knows how he does it. l keep buying more. l feel tired all of a sudden. You OK? Not hungry? How about a biscuit? l think l'll be of to bed. Good-bye. Goodnight. Can l get my toothbrush from your room? Some people feel sick the first time. No, l'm OK. l feel... light-headed. Pleasant, isn't it? l feel light-headed too. Care to dance? Yes. Sorry, did l hurt your foot? Sure you're OK? - l'm really sorry. - Don't worry. - l've never done that before. - It's all right. Let's carry on. l'll be careful from now on. We'll just keep our feet still. l won't be a minute! Hi! Quick! l'm badly parked. Julia's dad lent me his car. - Need a hand? - No, this is all there is. - If you left anything... - l think it's all gone. You never know. l nearly forgot that T-shirt you lent me when l got my nightdress caught in the oven door. Keep it. l gave it to you. lt's old, anyway. Use it as a duster and you'll think of me. OK. Let's keep in touch. You'll have to come round. The flat's amazing. l'm glad for you. You look happy. Pity we've no time for coffee, but l'm badly parked. l understand. Good-bye. Good-bye. Did l tell you... l'm giving up the flat. l gave the landlord my notice. You're going? We had good times here. Where will you live? l don't know yet. lt's very nice around Place Monge, where we are. l hope you won't be choosing alone. Keep me posted about Gabriel. The four of us should have dinner. You'll see, it's superb. Come in. No, try it for size. Sit down. You shouldn't have. My pleasure. When l saw it, l thought of you. Good, isn't it? Good-bye. Don't you recognise me? Julien! My word! Are you well? Good to see you again. How's it going? l'm still in music. Music? Oh, l didn't know. Well done. Does it pay well? Enough to get by. And how are you? Not that great, to be honest. Still got the restaurant? No, l lost it. Remember when l saw you and l was in a hurry? l'd just received a call to say health inspectors were in my restaurant and it was going badly. The restaurant opposite made up evidence against me. l had to close for a month. l had lots of debts the banks pulled out, so l came back to Paris. l'm sorry. - Oh, it's OK. - But still... But that's not all. You have other worries? Yes. Partly... because of you. Because of me? lf you hadn't taken Julia to the seaside that day, maybe l'd be OK. Let me tell you, l've known a lot of girls, but as soon as l saw Julia l felt something new. Why didn't you call her? Why? Because she gave me the wrong number. l called as soon as l got back. The guy didn't even know her. l bet it was an accident. But now l run into you... Incredible! Tell me how she is. Well, er... l don't know. l've lost touch with her but l think she's OK. Give me her number. Yes... Er, no... l erased it from my mobile. You don't have it? You must have it somewhere! Don't you want to give it to me? l do, but l haven't got it on me. lt must be in my address book at home. Take my card. Call me with her number. Can l rely on you? It's very important. Give me your number. 06-85-82-12-13. Let's get a drink? - Well... - Come on. l have to go. l'm in a real hurry. Don't forget. Call me. Please! No, the thing is, l'm not home yet. l'll call you when l get there. No, l don't know what time. lt might be very late tonight. OK, speak to you later. Did you have a good day? Yes, and you? l couldn't wait. l missed you. Not answering? l've decided no one should disturb us when l'm in your arms. - Not eating? - l am, l am. Not answering? No, we're eating. Don't you check who's calling? l'll turn it of, in fact. lsn't that better? Wouldn't this colour go well in the bedroom? But it's pink! Not any pink - Bohemian pink. You like it? Yes... of course. Yes, no, l was just dropping of. The more l look at it the more l like it. - We have the same tastes, then? - Yes. Good. But watch the rhythm. You're speeding up. Be right back. What's wrong? l'm sorry, but l can't give you her number. There's no point insisting. l promised l wouldn't divulge it. Why? l called her to find out how she's doing. l said l'd seen you, that you wanted her number. She won't let me divulge it. Did she say why? She's living with someone. We'll stop there. You can go. Tell me, David. Do you think she loves him? l think so. Seriously, does she really? l can't answer for her but l think so. ls she happy with him? l think so. You think or you know? lf she's not head over heels in love with him l can't stop hoping. You see? Sorry to say this, but l'm sure she loves him totally. She's mad l didn't call? l think so. But you told her she gave me a wrong number. How did she react? Well, she said that it was unlucky, that fate had settled the matter. l must see her, talk to her. Let me see her. That's just not possible. Just 5 minutes. l must talk to her. l must say good-bye, you see? l must mourn my loss. And above all l want to hear her say it's over. Only then can l turn the page. Fix me a date. l beg you. l'll see what l can do. Thank you so much for helping me. What are you doing here? l just came to say hi. Thanks. l'm going for a sandwich. - Can l come too? - If you like. What's wrong? You look weird. Something unexpected happened. Can we talk? l need to know your opinion. l wouldn't tell Julia. You'd be taking a risk. What risk? l'm sure Julia loves me. And l don't like hiding things. l feel dishonest. l feel guilty around her, around Julien even when l'm all alone. What can l say? Do what your heart says. My heart doesn't say anything. lt's got nothing to do with the heart, has it? l must tell you something. Hi. Hello. Come here. Can l talk to her alone? No, l promised to stay with her. Just for 5 minutes. Just 5 minutes? OK, 5 minutes, but no longer. Thanks. l'll be at the café. l'll wait for you. See you. Not bad, eh? This is the bedroom. Terrific bed. Here, sit down. Try it out. What do you think? Can you feel that mattress? This is the kitchen. Fully equipped. Built-in lighting. This is the bathroom. Everything you might need. Hot and cold water. lt's got the works. You like it? Any questions? How much is the rent? For now, it's nothing. - Nothing? - Yes, it's on me. - But... - l insist. - There's no need. - l saw the landlord. l have to give 3 months' notice. lt's all the same to me. Then, if you feel good, if you like it here, l'll talk to the landlord. l don't want you to pay for me. lt's my pleasure. lf l paid half, l'd feel more at home. OK, you pay half. 3 days later Hi. l wasn't expecting you. l was in the neighbourhood. Is it a bad time? No, it's just that l'm moving out. l'm packing, as you can see. lt's endless. So you're leaving for good. Yes, l move out tomorrow. lt's already rented out. A couple. l met them when they visited. They seem nice. They're about our age. Where'll you go? l don't know yet. A girlfriend can put me up for a while. She's in Ivry. lt'll be a long journey to work. l know, but it's temporary. l've moved into a place not very far from here. Really? But l thought you and Julia... liked your place. Yes, that's true. ln fact, Julia stayed there. l'm the one who moved out. You don't mean...? Will you manage? To be quite honest, l feel weird. ln what way? Weird. l'm in a strange state. l know l've undergone a terrible shock. l know that it'll be hard to enjoy life again. But right now, it hasn't hit me yet. What l mean is l've had the shock but l'm not yet unhappy. l'm sure it'll come. l know it will but it hasn't yet. It's a delayed reaction. lt's like being at the border of 2 countries in a big neutral zone. Maybe you're not in the right country. Meaning? Christopher Columbus thought he was in China, not America. Yes, maybe you're right. And how are you doing? l don't dare ask about Gabriel. You'd have mentioned it. He hasn't called. Maybe he never will. But it's OK. l've a lot of work on. l'm busy. l've just bought a tricky new machine. Plus the move. It all takes time. Couldn't you rent a place nearby? lt's hard now. The rent's too dear for me. Sharing's the answer nowadays. Yes, it's half price. Now l'm on my own, my money will go so fast. lf only l could share the rent... Why not advertise? You never know who you'll find. Can you describe it to me? Maybe l know someone who'd be interested. Well, it's not bad. One room acts as the living room, dining room, office and other stuff l can't remember. There's a fully-equipped kitchen. A little bathroom with shower hot and cold water. And lots of cupboards. - It sounds good. - It is. No, the only problem is... There's only one room. People can still live together. That's just what l think but lots of people would disagree. - Especially as... - What? There's only one bed. So what? l understand your surprise, but most people don't like sharing the same bed. Pity my friend's putting me up. l would've helped you out, especially as l won't feel at home whereas if l shared the rent with you, psychologically speaking, l'd feel partly at home. But l suppose... she'll be disappointed if you don't go. Yes. But with all the boxes l have... You're taking them all? What else can l do? There's room at my place. Are you sure? Yes, it feels a bit empty at the moment. l don't have much stuff. lt'd be silly to take it all when l could put it nearby. lt wouldn't be logical. Right, it's just a matter of logic. That's what reason's for.. Iogical reasoning. l'll call my friend and tell her it's more logical. 3 hours later l'm going to sleep. Me too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Maybe we could kiss goodnight? You're right. Just to say goodnight, right? That's what l meant. Just to say goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Translation & Original Subtitles..
