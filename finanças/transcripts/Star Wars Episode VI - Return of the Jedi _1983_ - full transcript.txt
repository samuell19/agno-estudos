(FOX FANFARE) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (TIE FIGHTERS ROARING LOUDLY) MAN: Command station, this is... ST-321. Code clearance blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. The security deflector... shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation... of your code transmission. Stand by. - You are clear to proceed. - We're starting our approach. (ROARING CONTINUES) (ALARM BLARING INDISTINCTLY) Inform the commander that... Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. Sir. (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. DARTH VADER: You may dispense... with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put... you back on schedule. I assure you, Lord Vader, my men... are working as fast as they can. Perhaps I can find new... ways to motivate them. I tell you this station will... be operational, as planned. The emperor does not... share your optimistic... appraisal of the situation. But he asks the impossible. I need more men. Then perhaps you can tell... him when he arrives. The emperor's coming here? That is correct, Commander. And he is most... displeased with your... apparent lack of progress. We shall double our efforts. I hope so, Commander... for your sake. The emperor is not as... forgiving as I am. - (R2-D2 BEEPS RAPIDLY) - C-3PO: Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca... never returned from this awful place. (R2-D2 BEEPING) Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've... heard about this Jabba the Hutt, - you'd probably short-circuit. - (R2-D2 WHINING) (R2-D2 WHISTLING) R2, are you sure this is the right place? (WHISTLES, BEEPS) I'd better knock, I suppose. There doesn't seem to be anyone here. Let's go back and tell Master Luke. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) - Goodness gracious me! - (SPEAKING HUTTESE) R2... D-Toa. (BEEPING) (HUTTESE) C-3POA. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) (JABBA LAUGHS) I don't think they're... going to let us in, R2. - (BEEPING) - We'd better go. (DOOR CREAKING) (R2-D2 BEEPING) C-3PO: R2, Wait! Oh, dear! R2! R2, I really don't think we... should rush into all this. Oh, R2! R2, wait for me! (WHISTLES, BEEPS) (GROWLS) (R2-D2 BEEPS) (GROWLING) Just you deliver Master Luke's... message and get us out of here. - Oh, my! Oh! - (GROWLING) - Oh, no! - (HUTTESE) Oh, my. (C-3PO SPEAKS HUTTESE) (R2-D2 BEEPS) We bring a message to your... master Jabba the Hutt. - (HUTTESE) - (R2-D2 BEEPING) (WHISTLING) - And a gift. - (BEEPS) - Gift? What gift? - (BEEPS, WHISTLES) (SPEAKING HUTTESE) (R2-D2 BEEPING) He says that our instructions... are to give it only to... Jabba himself. (R2-D2 WHISTLING) (GROWLING) I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so... stubborn about these sort of things. C-3PO: R2. I have a bad feeling about this. Oh. (BARKING) JABBA: Oh. (R2-D2 WHINING) Ohh! (SPEAKING HUTTESE) - Good morning. - (R2-D2 WHIMPERS) (HUTTESE) - The message, R2. The message. - (BEEPS) Oohh shoodah. (R2-D2 BEEPING) LUKE: Greetings, Exalted One. - Allow me to introduce myself. - Ohh. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight... and friend to Captain Solo. LUKE: I know that you are... powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with... Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (JABBA LAUGHING) LUKE: With your widsom... I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill... I present to you a gift... these two droids. - What did he say? - (BEEPS) Both are hardworking... and will serve you well. This can't be. R2, your... playing the wrong message. (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING HUTTESE) Aah! (HUTTESE) - We're doomed. - Mmm. Solo. R2, look... Captain Solo. C-3PO: And he's still... frozen in carbonite. (R2-D2 WHISTLES) (LAUGHING) What could possibly have... come over Master Luke? Was it something I did? He never expressed any... unhappiness with my work. Ohh! How horrid! Ohh! (GROWLING) (WHISTLING) (WHINING) (DROID YELLING) (SCREAMING) Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol... droid, are you not? I am C-3PO... Yes or no will do. Oh. Well, yes. How many languages... do you speak? I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can... Splendid. We have been without an interpreter since our master got... angry with our last protocol droid and... disintegrated him. - Disintegrated? - (SCREAMS) Oh. Guard! This protocol droid... might be useful. Fit him with a restraining... bolt and take him back up to His Excellency's... main audience chamber. R2, don't leave me! (EXCLAIMS) (WHISTLES, BEEPING) You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon... learn some respect. I have need for you on... the master's sail barge, and I think you'll... fill in nicely. No! No! No!

(HUTTESE) The illustrious Jabba... bids you welcome and will gladly pay you... the reward of 25,000. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) - 50,000. No less. - (YELLS) (C-3PO SCREAMS) (SPEAKING HUTTESE) What did I say? (HUTTESE) The mighty Jabba asks... why he must pay 50,000. (SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT) Because he's holding... a thermal detonator! (SCREAMING) (CHEWIE GROWLING) (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING HUTTESE) Jabba offers the... sum of 35... and I do suggest you take it. (GROWLS) (SPEAKING UBESE) He agrees!

Who are you? - Someone who loves you. - Leia. I got to get you out of here. (JABBA LAUGHING) What's that? - (LAUGHING CONTINUES) - I know that laugh. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) Hey, Jabba... Look, Jabba, I was... just on my way to pay you back, and I got a little sidetracked. - It's not my fault. - (HUTTESE) (LAUGHING) Look. Jabba, I'll pay you triple. You're throwing away a fortune! Don't be a fool! LEIA: We have powerful friends. You're going to regret this. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) (GROANS) Oh, I can't bear to watch. (LAUGHING) HAN: Chewie? - (GROWLS) - Chewie, is that you? - Chew. Chewie! - (CHEWIE GROWLS) I can't see, pal. What's going on? (CHEWIE GRUMBLING) Luke? Luke's crazy. Can't even take care of himself... much less rescue anybody. (GROWLS) (STAMMERS) A Jedi knight? I'm out of it for a little while, everybody... gets delusions of grandeur. (GRUMBLES) I'm all right, pal. I'm all right. (DOOR CREAKING) (GROWLS) (SPEAKING HUTTESE) LUKE: I must speak with Jabba. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) You will take me to Jabba now. You serve your master well. And you will be rewarded. At last! Master Luke's... come to rescue me. - Master. - Ohh! Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. (SPEAKING HUTTESE) I must be allow to speak. You will bring Captain Solo... and the Wookie to me. (LAUGHING) Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo... and his friends. You can either profit... by this or be destroyed. It's your choice, but I warn you... not to underestimate my powers. Master Luke, you're standing on...

His High Exaltedness, the... great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to... be terminated immediately. Good. I hate long waits. (LAUGHING) You will therefore be... taken to the Dune Sea... and cast into the... Pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the... all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will find a new... definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested... over a thousand years. (GROWLS) On second thought, let's pass on that.

(R2-D2 BEEPING) We'll promise to keep. An old friend. (TIE FIGHTERS ROARING LOUDLY) (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) (STEAM HISSING) EMPEROR: Rise, my friend. (DARTH VADER BREATHING) DARTH VADER: The Death Star will be... completed on schedule. You've done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you... wish to continue your search for... young Skywalker. Yes, my master. Patience, my friend. In time... he will seek you out. And when he does... you must bring... him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can... we turn him... to the dark side... of the Force. As you wish. Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. (EMPEROR LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (BEEPS, WHISTLES) Hmm. Hmm. YODA: That face you make... Look I so old... to young eyes? No. Of course not. I do. (COUGHING SOFTLY) Yes, I do. Sick have I become. Hmm, old and weak. When 900 years old... you reach, look as good... you will not, hmm? (YODA LAUGHING RAPIDLY) Soon will I rest. Yes. Forever sleep. Hmm. Ahh... earned it I have. Master Yoda, you can't die. Strong am I... with the Force, but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon... night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force. But I need your help. LUKE: I've come back to... complete the training. No more training do you require. Already know you... that which you need. (SIGHS) Then I am a Jedi. Oh. (LAUGHS, COUGHS) Not yet. One thing remains... Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will. Master Yoda. Is Darth Vader my father? Rest I need. Yes. Rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is. And unfortunate. Unfortunate that I know the truth? YODA: No. Unfortunate... that you rushed to face him, that incomplete was... your training, that not ready for the burden were you. I'm sorry. YODA: Remember... a Jedi's strength... flows from the Force. But beware... Anger... fear... aggression... the dark side... are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it... dominate your destiny. Luke. Luke. Do not... do not... underestimate the... powers of the emperor, or suffer your father's... fate you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke... the Force runs strong... in your family. Pass on what you... have learned. Luke... there is... another... Sky... walker. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) (R2-D2 BEEPS SOFTLY) (BEEPING CONTINUES) I can't do it, R2. (BEEPS, WHISTLES) I can't go it alone. OBI-WAN: Yoda will... always be with you. Obi-Wan. Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed... and murdered my father. Your father... was seduced by the... dark side of the Force. He ceased to be... Anakin Skywalker... and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father... was destroyed. So what I told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view? Luke, you're going to find... that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly... on our own point of view. OBI-WAN: Anakin was... a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was... already a great pilot, but I was amazed how strongly... the Force was with him. I took it upon myself... to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct... him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There is still good in him. He's more machine... now than man, twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. OBI-WAN: You cannot... escape your destiny. You must face... Darth Vader again. I can't kill my own father. Then the emperor... has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. - But I have no sister. - Hmm. To protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your... father when you were born. The emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to... have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason... why your sister remains... safely anonymous. Leia. Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings... deep down, Luke. They do you credit... but they could be made... to serve the emperor. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Well, look at you. A general, huh? Ah, someone must have told them about my.... little maneuver at the Battle of Tanaab. Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were looking for... somebody to lead this crazy attack. I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it. Well, who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember? (BELL CHIMES) MON: The emperor's made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoint the... exact location of the... emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon... systems of this Death Star... are not yet operational. With the imperial fleet spread... throughout the galaxy, in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the emperor... himself is personally overseeing... the final stages of the... construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died... to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please. ACKBAR: You can see here... the Death Star... orbiting the forest moon... of Endor. Although the weapon systems... on this Death Star... are not yet operational, the Death Star does have... a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by... an energy shield... which is generated from the... nearby forest moon of Endor. (BEEPING) The shield must be deactivated... if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down... our cruisers will... create a perimeter... while the fighters fly... into the superstructure... and attempt to knock out... the main reactor. General Calrissian. Has volunteered to lead the fighter attack. Good luck. You're gonna need it. General Madine. MADINE: We have stolen a... small imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship and... using a secret imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. C-3PO: Sounds dangerous. I wonder who they found to pull that off. General Solo, is your... strike team assembled? Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew... for the shuttle. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - That's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't wanna speak for you. (GROWLS) - That's one. - General. - Count me in. - LUKE: I'm with you, too. - What is it? - Ask me again sometime. - Luke. - Hi, Han. Chewie. (R2-D2 WHISTLES) "Exciting" is hardly the word I would choose. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) HAN: Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. All right, old buddy. I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She won't get a scratch. All right? Right. I got your promise. Not a scratch. (CHUCKLES) Would you get going, you pirate? - Good luck. - You too. - Got her warmed? - She's coming up. (CHEWIE GRUNTS) Yeah, well, I don't think the... Empire had Wookiees in mind... when they designed her, Chewie. Hey, you awake? Yeah. I just got a funny feeling... like I'm not gonna see her again. (GROWLS) Come on, General, let's move. Right. Chewie... let's see what this piece of junk can do. - Ready, everybody? - All set. (R2-D2 BEEPING) Here we go again. HAN: All right. Hang on. (THRUSTERS FIRES) (TIE FIGHTERS ROARING) DARTH VADER: What is thy bidding... my master? Send the fleet to the... far side of Endor. There it will stay... until called for. What of the reports... of the rebel fleet... massing near Sullust? EMPEROR: It is of no concern. Soon the rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us. Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command... ship and await my orders. Yes, my master. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get out of here pretty quick, Chewie. MAN: (ON RADIO) We have you on our screen now. Please identify. Shuttle Tydirium... requesting deactivation... of the deflector shield. Shuttle Tydirium... transmit the clearance code... for shield passage. (CHEWIE GROWLS) Transmission commencing. Now we find out if that code... is worth the price we paid. It'll work. It'll work. Vader's on that ship. HAN: Now, don't get jittery, Luke. - There a lot of command ships. - (CHEWIE GRUNTS) Keep your distance, though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. - (CHEWIE GRUMBLES) - HAN: I don't know. Fly casual. Where is that shuttle going? Shuttle Tydirium... what is your cargo and destination? HAN: Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. Do they have a code clearance? It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. That's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here. Shall I hold them? No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. As you wish, my lord. Carry on. They're not going for it, Chewie. (CHEWIE GRUNTS) Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield... will commence immediately. - Follow your present course. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) Okay. I told you it was going to work. No problem. C-3PO: Oh, I told you it was dangerous here! (GROWLS) LEIA: Should we try and go around? LUKE: I'll take time. HAN: This whole party will be... for nothing if they see us. (GROWLS) Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. Quietly. There might be... more of them out there. Hey, it's me. (SIGHS) Go for help! Go! LUKE: Great! Come on! (YELLS) (GRUNTING) Over there! Two more of them! I see them! Wait! Leia! HAN: Hey, wait! (ENGINES REVVING) Quick! Jam their comlink! Center switch! Move closer!

Take the squad ahead. We'll meet... at the shield generator at 0300. Come on, R2, we'll need your scanners. (R2-D2 BEEPS) C-3PO: Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.

(SPEAKING EWOKESE) (TIE FIGHTERS ROARING) EMPEROR: I told you to remain... on the command ship. DARTH VADER: A small rebel force... has penetrated the shield... and landed on Endor. Yes, I know. My son is with them. EMPEROR: Are you sure? I have felt him... my master. Strange that I have not. I wonder if your... feelings on this matter... are clear, Lord Vader. They are clear, my master. Then you must go to the... sanctuary moon and wait for him. He will come to me? I have foreseen it. His compassion for you... will be his undoing. He will come to you... and then you will... bring him before me. As you wish. HAN: Luke! Luke! Oh, Master Luke. (ROARS SOFTLY) There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this. I'm afraid that R2's sensors... can find no trace of Princess Leia. I hope she's all right. (CHEWIE GROWLS LOUDLY) - What, Chewie? - (CHEWIE GROWLS) HAN: What, Chewie? (CHEWIE GRUMBLING RAPIDLY) Hey, I don't get it. It's just a dead animal, Chewie. LUKE: Chewie, wait! Don't! (ALL SCREAMING) - Nice work. - (CHEWIE HOWLING LOUDLY) HAN: Great, Chewie. Great.

I am some sort of god. (R2-D2 BEEPS RAPIDLY) (CHEWIE GROWLS LOUDLY) Well, why don't you use... your divine influence... and get us out of this? I beg your pardon, General Solo... but that just wouldn't be proper. Proper? It's against my programming... to impersonate a deity. Why, you... (SPEAKING EWOKESE) My mistake. He's an old friend of mine. Jabba jabba jabba. (SCREAMING IN EWOKESE) Ow! Hey. (SQUEAKS) (CHEWIE GRUMBLES SADLY) I have a really bad feeling about this. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) What did he say? C-3PO: I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the... main course at a banquet in my honor.

(CHEWIE GRUMBLES ANGRILY) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) Somehow I got the feeling that... didn't help us very much. 3PO. Tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. But, Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly. Just tell them. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) Boom! (SPEAKING EWOKESE) You see, Master Luke? They didn't believe me, just as... I said they wouldn't. Wait, wait. (BLOWS) (EWOKS WHOOPING INDISTINCTLY) (SCREAMING) Put me down! Help! Somebody! Somebody, help! Master Luke! R2, R2, quickly! (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) - (BEEPS, GROANS) - (THUDS) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (R2-D2 BEEPING) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Thank goodness. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (R2-D2 CHIRPS SOFTLY) LUKE: Thanks, 3PO. I never knew I had it in me. C-3PO: Woochana makawartas, woochana makawartas. Nervrenda bootootoo Tatooine. Faraway, mana quitoo. Princess Leia wasay wapa R2. Oos batata rundi... Darth Vader! (DARTH VADER BREATHING) Un Chenko baskimo... quertonto Death Star.

(SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) What's going on? I don't know. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (DRUM ROLLING) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) Wonderful. We are now... a part of the tribe. Just what I always wanted. (LAUGHS SOFTLY) (R2-D2 BEEPING RAPIDLY) Well, the short help's better... than no help at all, Chewie. He says the scouts are going to show us... the quickest way to the shield generator. Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. - (SPEAKING EWOKESE) - Try and get our weapons back. Hurry up, will you? I haven't got all day. LEIA: Luke, what's wrong? Leia. Do you remember your mother... your real mother? Just a little bit. She died when I was very young. What do you remember? Just images, really. Feelings. Tell me. (SIGHS) She was... Very beautiful. Kind... but sad. Why are you asking me this? I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her. Luke, tell me, what's troubling you? Vader's here. Now, on this moon. How do you know? I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering... the group and our mission here. - I have to face him. - Why? He's my father. Your father? It won't be easy for you... to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance. Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power... I don't understand... and could never have. You're wrong, Leia. You have that power, too. In time, you'll learn... to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. And... my sister has it. Yes. It's you, Leia. I know. Somehow... I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him. No! Luke, run away. Far away. If he can feel your presence... then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. No, you don't. You've always been strong. But why must you confront him? Because... there is... good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the emperor. I can save him. I can turn... him back to the good side. I have to try. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) HAN: Hey, what's going on? Nothing. I just want to be... alone for a little while. Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's going on? (STAMMERS) I can't tell you. Could you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? I... Ahh. HAN: I'm sorry. Hold me. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) This is the rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it. I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed... only with this. DARTH VADER: Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and... bring his companions to me. Yes, my lord. The emperor has been expecting you. I know, Father. So, you have... accepted the truth. I've accepted the truth that you... were once Anakin Skywalker, my father. That name no longer... has any meaning for me. It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. LUKE: I know there is good in you. The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring... me to your emperor now. (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) I see you have constructed... the new lightsaber. Your skills... are complete. (LIGHTSABER DEACTIVATING) Indeed you are powerful... as the emperor... has foreseen. Come with me. Obi-Wan once thought... as you do. You don't know... the power of... the dark side. I must obey... my master. I will not turn. And you'll be forced to kill me. If that is your destiny. Search your feelings, Father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate. It is too late... for me, son. The emperor will show you... the true nature... of the Force. He is your master, now. Then my father is truly dead. (CHEWIE GRUNTS) LEIA: The main entrance to the control bunker is on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't going to be easy. HAN: Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of... places more heavily guarded than this. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) LEIA: What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance... on the other side of the ridge. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume... attack coordinates. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Don't worry. My friend's down there. He'll have that shield down on time. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Or this will be the... shortest offensive of all time. All craft. Prepare to jump into... hyperspace on my mark. LANDO: All right, stand by. (THRUSTERS FIRING) (WHISTLING) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) Back door, huh? Good idea. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) It only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet like. Oh, my! Princess Leia! I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done... something rather rash. - (CHEWIE EXCLAIMS) - LEIA: Oh, no. (HAN SIGHS) There goes our surprise attack. - (ENGINE STARTS) - Look, over there! Stop him! (SCREAMING) Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this. (EWOKESE) I have decided that... we shall stay here. Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo! Hey! - (BLASTER FIRES) - (CHEWIE GROWLS LOUDLY) (DARTH VADER THEME PLAYING) EMPEROR: Welcome... Young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer need those. (CLATTERS) Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to... completing your training. In time, you... will call me... master. You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me... as you did my father. Oh, no. My young Jedi. You will find... it is you... who are mistaken... about a great... many things. DARTH VADER: His lightsaber. Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know... your father can never be turned... from the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead, and you with me. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Perhaps you refer to... the imminent attack... of your rebel fleet. Yes. I assure you... we are quite safe... from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your... friends is yours. It is pointless... to resist, my son. Everything that... has transpired... has done so according... to my design. Your friends up there on... the sanctuary moon are walking into a trap... as is your rebel fleet. It was I who allowed... the Alliance to know... the location of... the shield generator. It is quite safe from... your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my... best troops awaits them. Oh... I'm afraid the... deflector shield... will be quite... operational... when your friends arrive. All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly, quickly. - Chewie! - (GROWLS RAPIDLY) (GROANS) LEIA: Han, hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. - Charges, come on! Come on! - (CHEWIE ROARS) Oh, my! They'll be captured! (SPEAKING EWOKESE) Wait! Wait! Come back! - R2, stay with me. - (BEEPS SOFTLY) Freeze! - (HAN GRUNTS) - (SCREAMING) You rebel scum! (CHEWIE EXCLAIMING) (HOWLING ANGRILY) (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) All wings report in. Red leader standing by. Gray leader standing by. Green leader standing by. Lock S-Foils in attack positions. May the Force be with us. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) We've gotta be able to get some kind... of reading on that shield, up or down. (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) How could they be jamming us if they don't know... if we're coming. LANDO: Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no reading. You sure? LANDO: Pull up! All craft, pull up! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Take evasive action. Green Group, stick to... Holding Sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy... ships in Sector 47. It's a trap. Fighters, coming in! There's too many of them! Accerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers. Copy, Gold Leader. EMPEROR: Come, boy. See for youself. From here, you will witness... the final destruction... of the Alliance... and the end of your... insignificant rebellion. You want this... don't you? The hate is swelling... in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment... you make yourself... more my servant. No. It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now... Mine. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) STORMTROOPER: All right, move it! Keep moving. Come on. C-3PO: Hello! I say over there! Were you looking for me? (CHEWIE GRUNTS) Bring those two down here. Well, they're on their way. R2, are you sure this was a good idea? - Freeze! - (EXCLAIMS) - Don't move! - We surrender. (EWOKS YELLING LOUDLY) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (GROWLS RAPIDLY) (EWOKESE) - (SCREAMS) - (GROWLS) - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (MEN CLAMORING INDISTINCTLY) (EWOKS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (GROANS) - (EWOKS YELLING) - (STORMTROOPER SCREAMING) (YELLING INDISTINCTLY) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (YELLING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING) (GROANS) (SCREAMS) The code's changed! We need R2! Here's the terminal! R2, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. (GROANS) What do you mean, you're going? (R2-D2 BEEPING EXCITEDLY) Going where, R2? No, wait! R2! Oh, this is no time for heroics! Come back! (SPEAKING EWOKESE) Watch yourself, Wedge. Three from above. - Red Three, Red Two, pull in. - Got it. Three of them coming in, twenty degrees. Cut to the left. I'll take the leader. They're heading for the medical frigate. - Pressure steady. - (SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder... what those Stardestroyers are waiting for. We're in attack position, sir. Hold here. We're not going to attack? I have my orders from the emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping. EMPEROR: As you can see... my young apprentice, your friends... have failed. Now witness... the firepower... of this fully armed... and operational... battle station. Fire at will, Commander. Fire! Oh, oh! That blast came from the Death Star! LANDO: That thing is operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader. We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat. You won't get another chance at this, Admiral. We have no choice... General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel... firepower of that magnitude. Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time! (SCREAMING) (GROANS) - (YELLING) - (GROANS) (GROANING) (R2-D2 BEEPS) We're coming. - (SCREAMS) - (BEEPING) Come on, come on! (BEEPING) Oh, R2! Hurry! - (R2-D2 SCREAMING) - Oh, my goodness! (BEEPING CONTINUES) R2, Why did you have to be so brave? (R2-D2 GROANS SADLY) Well, I suppose I could... hot-wire this thing. LEIA: I'll cover you. (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (GROANING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING) LANDO: Yes, I said closer! Move as close as you can... and engage those Stardestroyers... at point-blank range! At that close range, we won't last... long against those Stardestroyers. We'll last longer than we... will against that Death Star! And we might just take a few of them with us! She's gonna blow! I'm hit! EMPEROR: Your fleet is lost. And your friends on the... Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape.... my young apprentice. The Alliance... will die... as will your friends. Good. I can feel... your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon. Strike me down with... all of your hatred... and your journey... towards the dark side... will be complete! (LIGHTSABERS ACTIVATING) - (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) - (EMPEROR LAUGHING) (EWOKS SHOUTING) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (CHEWIE GROWLS LOUDLY) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CHEWIE YELLING) Look! Get him off of there! Whoa! - (SCREAMING) - (GROANS) (EWOK SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (SPEAKING EWOKESE) (CHEWIE ROARS) (ROARING EXCITEDLY) (ROARING CONTINUES) Yahoo! Yee-haa! (CHEWIE EXCLAIMS HAPPILY) Yahoo! Yee-ha! Yee-ha!

(LEIA SCREAMS) (GROANING) Princess Leia, are you all right? - Let's see. - It's not bad. - Freeze! - Oh, dear. Don't move! - I love you. - I know. STORMTROOPER: Hands up! Stand up! Stay back. - (CHEWIE GROWLS) - Chewie! (GROWLS LOUDLY) Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait! I got an idea. (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) (CRACKLING CONTINUES) (GROANS, SCREAMS) (EMPEROR LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Good. Use your aggressive... feelings, boy. Let the hate... flow through you. (EMPEROR LAUGHS SOFTLY) (LIGHTSABER DEACTIVATING) Obi-Wan as... taught you well. I will not fight you, Father. - You are unwise to lower your defenses. - (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) (LIGHTSABER CRACKLING) (CRACKLING CONTINUES) Your thoughts betray you, Father. I feel the good in you... the conflict. There is... no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before. I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the... power of the dark side. DARTH VADER: If you will not fight, then... you will meet your destiny. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHING RAPIDLY) EMPEROR: Good. Good! (LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING) Watch out! Squad at Point 06. I'm on it, Gold Leader. Good shot, Red Two! We're sure in the middle of it now. Come on, Han, old buddy... don't let me down. HAN: It's over, Commander. The rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements... to continue the pursuit. Send three squads to help. - Open the back door. - Sir. (EWOKS CHEE
