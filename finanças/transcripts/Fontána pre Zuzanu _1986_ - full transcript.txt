Breasts should be of medium size with the gap between them big enough to fit in a third breast, should there be one. The distance between the two nipples should be equal to the distance between a nipple and the respective collar bone. The third breast... That boy must be doing it on purpose. That's unbelievable. Full of mistakes. Benák, Benák... We return the books on Monday. I wonder what questions I'll get at the exam. They take one student out of every ten. But you're revising, sis. You'll smash it one day! That's what happens when girls stay at home alone. Dad is rushing about, and we, three doves, just have to wait for him. So why did you marry him, mum? He was handsome. I was head over heels in love with him. Mum! And he was with me! Stop! Do you hear me? Stop! Let go of the stick! I'll show you the stick, you bastard! Once I get you in my hands, I'll teach you how to behave, if your dad didn't! He was accepted as a mechanic. Good, at least he'll fix our car. Anyway, it's more interesting from behind the blinds, Mr. Domorák! What do you mean...? Let's fly together, look I'm already flying! I'll show you how to fly...! Trying to pick up a girl, Bohuš? I'm a furious reporter. I squeeze my way through a pack of women. One hundred, two hundred, three hundred, one thousand women! I'm reaching the stage unmolested, and who do I see in the spotlight? Yes, it's him! The star of The Fountain, Olino Zrubec! It's your turn, sis. It's Wednesday. Mary, impossible as always. I'm a furious reporter. And who's the new guy? Picasso's come by! Look at those two old ladies. They chatter away until their eighties! The jack, the king dressed in black are going to have a snack. I'm a furious reporter... furious! My pictures will be sent all over the world! What you don't know, you'll learn from them. Look up. The ladies in a cordial conversation! The secret of the closed blind, is rumored to be... Never mind! Christina... hop! Domorák, inconspicuous as always! Do you know the Chinese folk song? Oy, liu, liu, oy, liu, liu, de yun yo... Ah, Olino, ten beers... Olino, ten beers! In a place with a beautiful view, will Bela give us an interview? Boring as ever. A boy just like many others, and yet different. You give life to a lump of clay... ... a cold lump of clay. I spy on you from our flat, so give me some love back. I love your hands, I miss their touch. Transform my soul into a piece of moldable mass. I love your hands, I admire that they are so tender, even though they can hurt. You look like a scarecrow in a cabbage field. But in it your dad looks like the Czech actor... Do you mean Kratina? Yeah. I'd like to meet a guy like him one day. What for? He's always absent. But he'd bring me presents all the time! I've never seen my dad. Mum burned all the pictures right after the divorce. She says I'm his spitting image. He must have been handsome... Take it off! You're so rude when dad isn't home! Your entrance exams are in a week. So what? Not everyone has to mug up as much as you. Why are you fretting so much? It's government property anyway... And give me back my t-shirt! I lend it her for three days, and the three days become a month. Calm down! Take mine for now! Let her be! Does she think that I need her lousy old t-shirt?! Eat it! Bela, come on, you can't go out without it! I can afford it. Bye, Sue. Sodom, Gomorrah! I wonder which one will pick him up. Bela, forget it, You'll find someone to marry anyway. And you run off and buy soda! Come on, don't cry. I'm not crying. We're clean, right? But what will I do now? Get on with your life. Guys! Bela! Tell her something, caretaker, she'll listen to you. At your age, Mrs. Milka? I can afford it. Goddamn brats! Ugh! I've been accepted! My mum isn't a teacher. Coal. In summer, as always. Distinguished teachers, dear students... Do I know? A hairdresser's job isn't that bad. My sister says it's pretty cool. Always better than going blind reading books all the time. I'll be your personal hairdresser. And we'll always be together. Best friends... Forever. I'll leave anyway. I have to. I'll go with you, okay? Even to the end of the world? You won't be the same. Grammar school girls are big-headed. I have to go. Susie, stay a bit longer. There's a hole in your umbrella. Grandpa told me that he used to chase bulls in the corrida with it. But now, when I look at it, I think it was the other way round. When it rains, the fountain seems to work. Bye. A boy just like many others, and yet different, you give life to a cold lump of clay. I love your hands, I admire that they are so tender, even though they can hurt. I spy on you from our flat, so give me some love back. I love your hands, I miss their touch. Transform my soul into a piece of moldable mass. Mould me into a piece of your world, where we can experience the miracle of this summer. Is it possible for you to love that impossible girl? Give it me! Give it me! Thief! Do you hear me? Gimme that! Suzanne! Give it to me! I like it. I don't know what's so funny about it. Even you mock me! The Titanic. Queen Mary. Or Elisabeth - two thousand three hundred meals. Tailcoats, evening gowns, music, beautiful women, gentlemen. They invite you to their table and thank you. Maestro, the liver and mushrooms were delicious! Très bien! Wonderful! Molto bene! Not like the local people. Lunch for five and a half crowns, they drink a beer, burp, grab their "old lady" and leave without even a "thank you". The same over and over again - for twenty years. The ship stays in one place and the river runs on to the sea. Are you bothering them again? And you, go and get some beer! You're abominable! You, Bela, Bohuš, and even that bloody Olino of yours! But he liked it! Does he think he's funny? And you're big-headed like all grammar school girls! If I were to become someone like you... Like what? A cow! I'd rather not go to grammar school! Goat! A brand new bra. You don't need it anyway. Cut it out! What is this supposed to mean? Could one of you explain it to me? Tomorrow you stay in your room 'til I return! I wish your dad were here! A throne for a queen. I found this for us. Just for you and me. I'm scared here. Then shut your eyes. Then I'd be even more scared. You've got great hair. Really... No. Not yet. What's so special about girls? - I don't get it. Forget about Bela, she wants an older guy. Whatever... At least you be sensible. Look at Olino... The worst thing is when a guy falls in love with a broad. It's just sweetie this and sweetie that... She twists you around her finger, you get married and you're a nobody. Hi. The new guy is quite cute, he just smells of varnish a bit or whatever. Do you know what he told me? Out of my way! Can't you take a break when someone's visiting? ... that I'm pretty cool. Pretty cool. Isn't he sweet? Well... You've been pretty tense lately, haven't you? Oh, Mary. Please, lend me that t-shirt. I'll wash it afterwards. Please... You've been pretty tense lately, haven't you? Mum, I... we've only been here with Olino. He's willing to take a look at the ignition in our car. He fixed his moped all by himself. You yourself said... that he's able to fix anything. Mary, always perfect... I told you to wait. You're jealous! Of him? Give me a break! Of course, you're jealous. Nobody ever notices you. And that dirty freak of yours, that you spy on, he's got a crush on Bela, not you! That's not true! You really are impossible! Just look at yourself, what could he see in you? Goddamn brats! You too? That's terrible! Ugh! And he looked like a decent guy! Maniac, an ordinary maniac! We should be careful around him. We should be careful around him. What is it again? Nothing. I don't understand you anymore. Mum, please don't tell dad. We don't tell lies in this family. We've been friends since childhood, and you never seemed to mind. But friends don't hide in hallways. Mr. Domorák? Domorák - no Domorák, you're too young for some things, don't you think so? Grandpa! Wait! Wait... I got it when I retired. They knew what I was dreaming of. Not like that, the other way round. I'll ruin my fingers one day anyway. A machine is not a harp. Grandpa, let's go! Look at him, the pirate, how impatient he is! A well-tuned engine also sounds like music. I always wanted to take a swim under the Southern Cross. Where could it just be? And I ended up in a beached steam-boat that was turned into a restaurant. I still can't see it. It burned down too. When you're fifteen, life is horrible. What? I've got it! Wow, it's shining like... Like, like? Like a star. Why are you sighing like an old man? There are many stars. But there is only one North Star. You have to work hard, or you'll miss your boat. Hi! Hi! At last! Well, girls? Where's Mary? She must have lost her mind. Later. First eat. Do something! Please, do something at least once! I'm pathetic as ever. And you're calm - as ever. What if something's happened to her? I'll...! Mary, go to bed. It's raining outside, isn't it? I really must be impossible. You've had a bad day. Well, what's wrong? What do you think? Your daughters are teenagers. And both at once. Tough luck... How about a short interview before the green light comes on? I can't say no to such a charming journalist. So... do you remember your first love? A bit. It ended before it ever really started. Just like all first loves. Was she prettier than mum? It's not a question of beauty. What, then? Hotshots! Are you not fishing today? I don't like reeling in empty hooks anymore. Since when? Pretty cool, isn't she? Will you take me as a stewardess, captain? You seem to be losing your balance lately, Miss. I'm afraid that it'll finish earlier than... And I'm afraid that I'll have to go fishing alone. Stop, stop! You haven't practiced again, you're out of tune. Me? Steve is! Because I'm following you. We'll get nowhere like this. Bohuš, you beat out the rhythm. Ami, Emi, C, G... and again Ami... Ami, Emi... the amplifier is mine! I'll play the solo! Again! Who's expected to listen to that bawling of yours? Do you want me to break it? Goddamn brats! Pack your stuff and get out! Heads! At the cash-desk! Do you think I don't know? Got your ID? Let's wait a little while. You told him about the Nautilus? You don't think at that moment. I'd probably be scared. What if you get pregnant? My folks would kill me. Your father is great. These are cool, really. Viki's no loser. And what about Bohuš? He's a stupid teenager. Don't you mind that you weren't his first girl? Let's strip down all the way. And what about you and Olino? Alright. What are you waiting for? Life is short, you must try everything. Viki said so too. Sooner or later, you've got to sleep with someone. Have you got it? Well... Oy, liu, liu, oy, liu, liu, de yun yo... Are we going to the Nautilus? Bela and her friends already hang out there. I've composed something for you. Suzanne, open up, I know you're there! Open up immediately! So you are just friends? Don't blame your daughter. You're decent people. It's the boy's fault. It was the street that brought him up! Olino! Do you know where this is going? But I love him. He'll always be messing with broken-down cars all his life. His father's a drunk and a gambler. Forty years old and working as a porter. No one would let him work on a scaffolding anymore. He's no match for you! Are we an extra posh family? I forbid you to talk that way! And don't you dare hide somewhere with him again! I didn't think you'd ever say something like that. You're so narrow-minded! I love him anyway! Olino, have you got a girlfriend? Of course, he has, he's a Zrubec! When I was his age... Girls who didn't hide in a tree... She's quite a piece. She walks like a swan, doesn't she, Olino? And from a fine family. You shouldn't drink so much. Give it to him. Your man's affairs are none of his business. What did you say? You're drunk! Good that Eva didn't live to see this. And she'll stay there. It's not her fault. The boy from the street will show you! I wish I had your problems! And what should I say? We're moving in autumn. Wow, that's beautiful! It plays by itself. You don't even touch the strings. I've got used to this place. I don't need to have a nice view. I'd prefer to stay down here. I know my way around. Audition to THE DECIBELS. I'll leave the amplifier in your cellar. That's already tomorrow! Not bad. Do you have your own equipment? Not yet, but I'll save money for it. I'll borrow something. We'll all be retired by the time you save enough. I am sorry. So the one before him. How could he have done it? I felt like... Viki thinks I'm seventeen. And who's this guy? Do it properly! It was awfully embarrassing. He really fooled around with you. And then he did a bunk. Coward! He works at the car plant as a test driver. And he's testing out inexperienced, naïve girls. Are you daft? Am I a little girl? If you want to know, he travels abroad. And he'll bring me some cool gifts. You look totally different now. It's nice. You know, I have to look pretty. Viki has good taste, he's seen the world. Well, something for a slender figure. If you don't stop hanging out with those tossers every night, you'll end up like your sister! None of your business! You'd better look after the baby. What about your folks? They got a fit of hysterics, of course. I don't like hanging out with them anymore. Not gonna stick at the fountain with them forever. They're such... babies. Olino too. He's all talk. I should have told you long ago. You can choose. Well, I've gotta... Stay a bit longer, Suzanne. I want us to always be together. They're nice. Come on. This is Viki... All right then, run after your prince! I should have done the chores in the kitchen today. I know. Thanks. You're welcome. We'll never quarrel again, ever. Ever! And what's that? Guess! Bastards! Cut out the noise! What is this - a motocross? Decent people live here! Get lost this minute, or I'll call the police! Just wait, I'll show you! Here! You need a bandage. Back there in the cupboard, next to the door. No, no! Wait! I'll do it myself! So now you know. He must have been an ace! My wife never forgave me. You know, he was our only son. She said I should have forbidden him. Forbidden! Like you can forbid you kids anything! In the end she left me. Have you lived alone ever since? I moved here, to a strange town. Just as these houses were finished. I wanted to find some peace here, to forget. Far from it! Everyone here has their family, happiness, children... And I have to listen to your screaming every single day. So I sit here with him. I sit here and remember. For twenty years. My dad doesn't give a damn about me anyway. He didn't use to be like that. He changed when your brother was born and your mum died. But he never brought another woman home. I know that. Because you spy on us? It's also a way to forget the loneliness. And now get lost. And keep to yourself what you saw here. Yes, he was totally different. They used to sit here with mum, wetting their feet and cooing. And the old man spied on them. As always. And the fountain went... Did it really work? Of course! Because your father built it. And he was a master mason! I thought they just abandoned it here. It's all rusty now anyway. Just like my old bones. It's become a bit chilly. Let's go to that casino of ours, before dad loses even us. I'll stay here a while longer. Alright. Come on, pirate. That's not possible. Don't tell anyone, all right? Olino! There's something wrong with it. Start it up! You've got a better ear, you're a musician. Well? It needs higher rotations. Yeah? Let's see what happens. Now it's the whispering of flowers. Wait. Don't you want to explain something to me? You don't mind me being friends with Suzanne? Not at all, it's something else. Of course, I can't compare to you. Look, I wouldn't have run away in such a situation. Tomorrow! I'm busy today. Who've you got there? Show me! Cut it out! I said tomorrow! It must be a woman! The main valve is in the basement. But it's probably sealed. We used to release out from here. And the inner circuit? The fountain has three circuits. It was my idea. Originally, as in the plan, it was supposed to only spray from above. It was great when we turned it on for the first time! The architect was taken completely aback. You should have seen his face... What a cheapskate, he didn't even pay for a drink for the guys. And won't it get clogged? The water pressure will keep the pipe clear. By the way, how is everything? Alright... Wow! Crawl! Can you see anything? You said you wouldn't tell anyone! Only our gang knows! You gossip like a girl! You are a girl! You should have been brave in the basement! It's none of your business! Don't yell at her, spy's confident! You were right, they are infantile. Come and fix my hair! So are you coming? I don't like those ridiculous moves. Her majesty, the writer, finds it undignified! Let her stay here forever! Suzanne, wait! I'll explain everything! Wrench! Oy, liu, liu, oy, liu, liu, de yun yo... ... with the gap between them big enough to fit in a third breast, should there be one. The distance between the two nipples should be equal... Where are you taking me? You said they'd drive us home. It's a surprise! Don't be daft, my folks will be furious! Life is short, you've got to try everything! I've got it! Dad... what actually is love? Love is what happens between two people who love one another. Give it to me. You'd better buy some soda before they close the shop! But... You're like dad! Hurry up! Olino... You? So what? Don't be afraid, baby... No! Let go! Do you hear me? Either you go or I do! Olino, the disco has long been finished. I don't give a damn about her! I wonder who's going to pay for that water. How are you? I'm okay. Bye then. Bye.
