Peppino Don't you come to school anymore? I do not feel like. But how don't you like it when you come to school? You were always happy and What are you doing? Now I have to help my brothers and therefore you instead that you do at school nothing always the same things Marta has me asked about you, what did he tell you? He asked me if I had seen you and then something and then if you are Always engaged, I have to go. Hello Let's play tomorrow at the river bye, bye. Mama said go to school to school to your dad walk, my feet hurt I can't do it like this every day every day every day she is tired. I have now arrived on the pitch and as usual there is always that shepherd who does not make me do anything immediately barely smash some wood. Even if this year the rain really ruined you Renato Great everything. In fact I don't know how to do it alone I can't do it I can do it. Do you know that maybe I go back to school? But your father said it, I mean, no, but I told my mother who said she'll take care of it and when you come back, maybe next time week you do not have to do your homework to study is a real bore, I want to do many things and then I don't want to become a shepherd and then I want to see myself with Marta engaged. Then yesterday I found a butterfly. I tried to take it and put it in a bag so I would have it brought by her and then Peppino Peppino Peppino died, where six? Are you finished looking for it? Me too nothing. I tried you in case I have a keep looking from these leave and Pino Pino Pino Peppino, have you seen Peppino? No, because I don't know this kid. I'm worried I gave him a month like that. Still understood what he had to do with it? I know it. He found a Cocoon the engraved knife he wanted to help the butterfly, but the ball is dead the meaning of life, it was necessary let her struggle. To cross that yours he would have fortified it, surely he would have been able to fly a beautiful Wow drawing. No you can't find them they got off before I was going to town, but go you always make fun of me. Eat this. Mum told you dad makes me go back to school mum when I'll go back to school. Next Monday mom mom. I talked to your mother that we made a decision. At first I was not very convinced, then Thinking back, I realized that I don't want you to be shepherds for the whole life. I have decided that we will go to the continent we will go to Genoa so or find a job you can all go working in the factory, they are opening a lot of balls father, I want to be an artist and they are all starved. You must work. You will become a good worker. Marta Marta what is it Marta? What do you want from her? And where are you going with my family? I don't know, maybe it's not true. I will write to you every day and will also send you drawings Cara Marta since I left. I do nothing but think of you. I miss you Sardinia the sky is all I have left we live in a big house, but it's not as beautiful as yours. There is nothing beautiful here. My brother Tonino found my father a job, but still no, it's been two months, even if it seems to me a lot learning to draw you know so I can send you the drawings that I promised you received your letter today and I answered you right away because I hope it will arrive soon so you can answer me you made me laugh so much when he does Banari again, but I don't it goes even more than Siri home there is no one here that makes me to laugh. I sent you a drawing drawing. I hope you like it like me I decided you know I want to become a painter like that when I'm famous I'll come back to you my father what do you do yet has not found work and we have few money. I'm taking organ lessons, because maybe I can work as an organist. How beautiful is the drawing that Peppino sent me one day you will be a great artist, you also know Enrico made me today a drawing drew my face. But I'd like you to have me portrayed so we could meet again. Today I saw your photo in the newspaper. How are you? Well dressed elegant I am so proud of you, finally you managed to realize your dream and I even if I am far away, but always your biggest fan, I miss you so much Peppino if unfortunately I will not be able to come and see you because the last exam and I have to study a lot but I took it for a swimmer she is maybe I could move there to Genoa with you. Dear Doctor Congratulations on the thesis, I just finished reading it. But now even if I have finished all the exams I want to do you a question, perhaps the most difficult. What do you think is the most important part of our body. Think carefully before giving me an answer. Indeed we do so. As soon as you know the answer I would come and tell me in person, you go I'll send you another drawing and a kiss and I'll do you again many compliments for your degree will be a good doctor. Malta definitely the most beautiful my favorite, me too I will not be able to come to Sardinia for a while I started to see night schools, I don't want to remain ignorant throughout life, I stopped playing the organ and decided not to write more those amazed novels that nobody ever reads, I want to dedicate myself only to painting. My true passion. You know every time I paint I do it thinking of you and it is Maybe that's why I call it, I like to caress the canvas feel the scent of colors and wait for the sunlight to illuminate my subjects I send you a sweet kiss Peppino. Bravo good really good. Thanks. I see you do some really wonderful things. Look at that particular. Look what I know we will do. So many great things about this because you're really good at it. Thanks the donkey is nice ok? I had so many beautiful things, I don't know you just told me I said no, maybe I was wrong. I also thought about you a lot, indeed sorry if I didn't write to you but I'm doing many exhibitions and sometimes not even time to breathe, but you know I could never forget you. No there are no women in my life just a few merchants the only woman in my life, you are your invitation to dancing excites me, but at the same time it scares me you know it's been so many years maybe too many. But it was a nice idea to organize this exhibition and nevertheless my many commitments, but very happy because I feel like it to review Yes, but above all I want to hug. There are so many people who have me here I saw so many applause, but then in the evening when I get home I feel alone I feel just because you're not there. I feel alone because without you my life and photos I feel just because because I need you but stay and can't wait to do this show with you, finally more friends than you meet to work together. Think if there hadn't been this drawing. I would be nobody today. I would still be among the sheep with the no longer going small. Thirty-year-old thing Enrico gave me when we were still small I keep it with me I always carry it with me facts today i took it because i want to see it and i want that that do you face? How beautiful! I didn't know about this. A really wonderful person a great friend. Are you beautiful Peppi and the event balance? Hello love Welcome Done, have a good trip your prepared a sensational group show because there was the conference print and recover your squares are liking a lot quite a lot of. So we had a good trip and these are. Yes, but for you to have a dedicated room that you don't I show. I don't understand why because it so highlights more yours that is among the others. Here are the jobs from this I don't know how to sew a dedicated room it's okay, that is, I had to do her a favor to friends, but I don't promise you that when I'm with a different friend than. It has to do with what it has to do with it because I am a moment the verse I understand I understand why don't you offend your paintings they are beautiful, but they are they are for you, I'm happy it's different. In the end we are in the 90s people wanted modern art. Jennifer Well Carmela, I'm Peppino. I'm Peppino. I want to buy Palazzo Buongiorno. Sorry I'm coming. Here I am here I am Joseph in America went to America that he said I have to go for a show to do and then I'll be back another time Vale has come for the exhibition it will take at least another month, at least another month that we are giving white, but what an embarrassment. So the stones so the white does not come in a month or so two maximum three next year is modern. And so I didn't understand a curator. She is still sad one and one that is meant for it's not where nobody works because i graduated from little, however, I learned that this exhibition then I respect Giuseppe a lot paper and therefore I like it for what you just met Giuseppe card all of a life a child together, then she told me this from the curator I don't know I'll tell you even when he did it when he thinks of everything I like much the work in which he painted the still life. It is really special only lifes she does not he never saw either. True, you are right, you read about him a lot. Last collection she has the honor of seeing only you all the eagles just know before even before the museum opens The game of shadows and the black study that is behind this black is a scholar I must have left I went crazy detector because it was not normal that I called absolute black, is a mix between Nino ivorio ivorio and a C'ho studied. She studied her, that is he who always studies these things, here a friend I gave him my hand, then being a house painter, he calls me I don't need to go absolute. You have this, don't you have it? A mess in the night I come if you ever give us I'm not yet presented. But it would have been Giovanna Giovanna Giuseppe paper that in America I have in Australia I understand anyway that you know Giuseppe carta, then she wants to make us a permanent museum or more permanent exhibition he doesn't even know what you want do you think would like to do I bought all dong palace he should give us a Kandinsky exhibition of important people to do. It does grow a bit mundane that eventually wets the country with 4 people, but I wanted to come people this association is created cultural, it is called Palma di arte how many Sofia would be two, however, I found one still has not given even a lira because they are all here they will not arrive maybe they will arrive what about taking off these house painter clothes a nice scarf a nice jacket and become. But why were you pretending not to be you or not? Did you even say to call yourself by another name Achilles well? I am an enemy but I did it so I always do it to avoid nuisance. So no, I didn't mean that but neither did you I knew it was so for I was there to paint, it was to give myself a tone to feel a little more important important kind cute cute cute memory, I'll tell you the truth I always have hoped you bring the paper master. Because from how you talked to me from how you looked at me because I hoped. Chicco did not call you Beniamino nothing. You are ugly and poor. A toast to my artist to the greatest contemporary artist that I know. It's not true, then you know I'm very proud of you really does a great job and also I'm very proud of you and you know it because you do a great job and all this really organized beautiful is that you know that there is no one who is to paint the glasses. Not true Remove the air that passes through them I know when you want to grow old makes you think of something sacred sacred songs le Marie. Truly the magic The 6. And then I said in general, here, however I am not married nor boyfriend. What is the surprise no longer has the surprise, right? Don't pray for Giusy. Hi Peppino, Saturday 70 Manari bought himself tonka cast, do you want to take a walk? No today I can't tomorrow then. But too many things have been changed. Tomorrow evening takamine at 3 am I wait for you there like old men times. I'm here Ruggero, but I feel the light. Really listen to that Bonifacio group, Naples. Bari Oh well, however, as those of Pietrasanta were punctual, Young ecologist, but tonight we are a little nervous what is there you want to fight tonight you want to be a housewife with the bored what is the problem you can know I have to see together, we do the usual things the usual Aldo brought in around the world we are seeing two months back from the thing there from China you saw all are a billion of Chinese I saw yesterday I saw Chinese. I have not seen anyone I remember that I saw yesterday, not I must remember that I saw yesterday I have to make a note I also write about vegetables, I, I saw yesterday, let's see that I saw yesterday. So yesterday I saw. Yesterday I saw Carmela, I mark Carmela, I also saw Tonino I had coffee. The priest greeted me. Just remember number I can't remember all people that I see Giovanna what this morbid jealousy is, what do you want me to tell you if you saw yesterday Tell me you not me I remember. I can't remember it is humanly impossible to remember all the people in Banari, you saw Marta yesterday I didn't remember, so that's why you didn't tell me that saw Marta because walking out of the corner of my eye, I have I saw Marta but it's not like I saw him, but we are glimpsed, of course. And I'm also that you have an appointment with me said are those things that are said no, we talked half an hour. Did he tell me how it is how it is? See you see you is not a date, but I want to know if you go to this appointment, everyone understood. I want these village people things too, okay? Because fortunately this country no one in the mouth you I said they do other people's business, ok? So I know there is this appointment he wants to know if you go there it is okay I will not go there to do what why should I go nobody goes there. I don't have an appointment, could you go there ok? Ok, because you always have it with you because it's not old stuff when I was young and beautiful and cute because I have to throw away I keep it so why I do the separate collection, ok and me I'm going for a walk. Ticor is the most important part of the body the heart you made so many these years are very important for an artist for a doctor. But then I thought that even without answering. I thought the eyes do not make you that it never could paint, but I'm not there you see life is beautiful. In the end I realized is the What is the most important part of the heart, don't call I can't hope I can't dream. I stay at home. He didn't even notice that being with you played the part more important than the body, it is not the heart, it beats more important I am the boss when I was a child loaded on my shoulders all the weight of my work and when I needed help when I want to cry, when I want to be well always looked for the shoulder of someone who shoots a friend are your back the door with all you let it go thing only to you. You will never forgive me. Take me to dinner tonight. I want to be alone with you. Giovanna I told you, I don't send her the canvases anymore because they just break. As I no longer do them on canvas. Just make them on plywood I make them on other materials, I can't allow all the times we do a show shipping and this is your fault. It's fault because you have to be careful about the shipments. It's not up to me. It depends on you, understand? But I'm there I do all all paintings all things and then with the expedition the account of how much I work is broken for you and from morning to night I have nothing to do. You must be careful. It's no good it's no good you ruin me is ruining my image so the broken destroyed paintings arrive and I can't allow and it's your fault everyone I do my job I do it well you have to do your job, you have to do well but we want to talk about you, you think it's easy to work by your side. Okay, but if I weren't here in this in this family company who does it, do you remember the last time that case where we went to dinner alone the two of us are always a Giovanna dinner, we are with other things we were last night Giovanna for dinner or I never take her to dinner. If I bring you the best restaurant in the world, how are you too in Paris, but please, do you remember? For example when we took a vacation together how many times I have booked the vacation home and then I went alone to take my holidays. Because you were busy at the last moment, he understood. I can't afford the holidays, understand? Ok? You like to see the car under the bottom, we want to do work that you can't go on vacation, that's why I'm sending you on vacation alone, understand? We want to talk about everyday life. There is no night tonight where you arrive earlier me and you say goodnight, you never say goodnight everyday life, that is, love the jets. I mean don't sleep at 9pm, are you asleep? I am up to 4 in the studio to paint. Because I more the next day the picture is ready, then I sell it and we make a lot of money while you what do you do? You sleep and day you wake up and send me the shipments to China in Japan all routes that you are wrong couriers Giovanna not okay not okay, you can't blame me why I'm not taking you on vacation, understand? This is not it. No, it's not my life Ok, ok. But what's mine mine? What are you? It is not understood even less we have to do one choice we have to work or stay together the two, maybe it doesn't match. Do you know what I do? Am I going to 70? Sorry if I got angry. Sorry for what I told you today. I think that behind a great man there is a great woman, i dont know if i am a great man, however i am sure of have a great woman next to you. We have done many things together. We have grown up we have carried my works around the world our hours we have made some money we bought a house a car as a child. All this would have seemed like a balance sheet and instead here I am here Joseph. When Genoa they called me emigrant sardignolo, I thought that my father would never make it too. My father always told me artists are all dead of hungry, you have to go to work. And when things went wrong. I said can protest are your Castellana. the impossible No, made perfect acquaintance all over the world cheers exhibitions. it's all thanks to me and thanks to you and thanks to us always I have always sought happiness in the eyes of my buyers I sought fame I always tried to make mine known name when it will end I was simply looking for happiness and I found the other, however, it has not been there for long I think Bring her down my biggest 8 something that stays forever a masterpiece that I will leave when I am gone I want to do it with you, but I think it could have been a verb do. Giuseppe are you ready Come on Giuseppe. Do not worry. Mum can I have the tie too Mum can I have too Peppino found the tie only gentlemen wear.
