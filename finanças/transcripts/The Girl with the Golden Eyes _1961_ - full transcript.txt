In 1834, Balzac wrote the story of "The Thirteen". Thirteen young men, sworn friends, who helped each other pursue ambitions, fortune and pleasure, without regard to risk. But the 13 were thwarted once, when one of them, Henri Marsay, fell for "The Girl With the Golden Eyes". A woman struck quicker and harder than them. To this day, there exist "Henris Marsay", "girls with golden eyes", and secret societies of 6, 10... or 13 men. Out of Balzac's story was born this modern tale, where the analogies are countless, where Paris remains the same crucible of light and shadow, where the "girl with the golden eyes" guards the mystery of a hidden life, and where Henri and Eléonore are part of the exciting and rarefied world of high fashion. - What on earth are they doing? - Are you scared? - No, I'm fed up. - Relax, there he comes. - I'm too old for these pranks. This could land us in jail. - And keep us there. - I hate playing musketeers, picking up a girl for Henri who could have any one. - He's getting older. - It's a vice. - No, a bet. - A stupid one at that. - You might win it though. - By risking prison for kidnapping. I can't afford to… - In London, when he pulled you out of that burning plane… - I know, one for all, all for one. But we're not boy scouts anymore. - What's next, a little sob story about your family? - Turn on the headlights. - The show's running late, but stay ready. - As part of this lace gala, here is, worn by Katia, number 211, "Lolita", A short evening dress by Nina Ricci. - Dammit, we can't work like that. - Ms. Alberte. I've been good. - So you want to keep the dress? - Only for tonight. - I'm too kind. - I'll be careful, promise! - This wedding dress is a Jacques Heim design. (- Focus, there she comes.) - You're crazy! Let me go! No! No, let me go! Let me go, no! Let me go! No! Stop it, you're hurting me! Let me go, no! No! - Sit down! You have a pale complexion, an abundant mane, your eyes are very smoky, which gives them a certain charm. As for your mouth, it's pouting, like that of a young puppy that still does its business in its basket. The twelve soldiers with me mean everything is possible here. Murder, or love. Sit down. I could kill you or love you. Both passionately. You can succumb, or yield. You've already chosen. Thank you. Henri Marsay. - Oh... Katia… Were you scared? You're relieved, flattered, of course… But mad at me too. Yes. Yes, I can tell. - Give that to me. - I almost forgot. For forgiveness. - No. Because I'll enjoy giving it right back to you. - Well, Katia, you're sitting on the terrace of a café… - Definitely not. - You're reading and when you sense me looking at you, you don't look back. - Why not? - A tactic. Me, I hesitate. - Why? - I don't know... You could be expecting someone else. - I broke up last night. - Yes. And since then? - Since then? I'm searching. - What can I do? - Give me the rose. - That's the first time it's worked! - Are you amused? - No more than you. - He's due for a slap in the face. - That may be what he's going for. - I'm sure he'll find the experience interesting. - Be quiet. Here comes our psychology minute. - Ow! - Your mouth will have to be widened. Don't grin. Your eyes will be less striking but more mysterious. Nothing suits you. Less green on the eyelids. A more uniform white. The face is a landscape! It is I who said that. "And I assure you I'm not a bad guy." "Ow!" "Your mouth will have to be widened. Don't grin." "Your eyes will be less striking... but more mysterious." "Nothing suits you." "Less green on the eyelids." "A more stable white." "The face is a landscape!" "It is I who said that." "Compared to a flat face." "If you listen to me, you'll look two years older, but with a more sincere beauty, or more fabricated, it's all the same." "Come now." - Meow! - Shh… - Oh. - My scotch, please. - Félix, here is your scotch. You like it? - Depends on the bartender. - Rest assured. We know the trade. - Really? - Really. - He's won again. - Did you hire a chauffeur? - Why? Don't you do the trick? Alright, they've seen me. You can let them out now. Come on! - Go, he's mean to you. - Who's the panther? Don't know her. - Maybe you knew her but forgot her? - Impossible. - What's she doing there? - Waiting. - So? - So I'm leaving. London. Looks like they're in pea soup fog again. - What are you doing? - Writing. And you? - Waiting. - Be patient. It's a client. Thank you. Where shall I drive you? Is it not me you were waiting for? I must have got the wrong car then. No, it's mine alright. So, you were waiting for me! No, don't leave, you're welcome. Hey, you might regret that. - Well, well. Not exactly a success. - Not sure. She has my card. - And? - And… "Henri Marsay will be waiting for you at 17:30 by the Lyon station clock." Want to bet? - She won't show. - Your doggies. - What would you do with them? - Can't you guess? - No, you wouldn't! - So, are you in? - What are you betting? - My carpet, they've already peed on it anyway. - Sonia, I want some momentum, some elegance! Go on, in the cage. On the perch! Cross your legs. Fold one over. Not like that! Ever seen a stork? Your neck looks stiff, stretch it. Like a pigeon, if you will. No, no scarf. Sit still, Sonia. - Ow! I'm going to break a leg. - No you're not! Try to look a little colder, it's winter! - When you're ready. Go, Sonia. - Your plumage is depressing… I want to see Chagall, some energy. - Let's go. - Sonia, you alright? - I'm boiling. - No no, it's winter! Relax, relax. There! How was it, Willy ? - Chagall written all over it. - Let the bird down. - No, wait a minute. - Not satisfied? - We can decide afterward. Cut the fan. - Cut those lights. Two more. Take them like snapshots. Let's go! Sonia, hollow your back. Chest forward, head back. Pay attention, darling. Let me see the cage. You're taking off! - Pleased with yourself? - What's your opinion? - You're a genius. - That's why I'm so affordable. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means, I'm not rich. - Girls? - Girls, girls… The studio, Davis in Portugal… - News? - His whiskey bill. - Is he a big drinker? - The pictures are fine. But he lacks ideas. It's hard work, finding your own style. - You're tired. - Did you remember my paycheck? - 15 days end of month, as usual. - That was yesterday. How's Austria going? - Magalie's leaving tonight. - And the team? - You'll put them on the plane tomorrow. - Why, are you sleeping in? - Yes, in Rome. - Flirting with Valentino ? - No, Veneziani. I love Italian fashion. It should only take me a day. I'll have time to stop by Innsbruck. - Oh, there it is. "We are crediting your account…" - How much? - Nosy! - Never in the morning, you know that well enough. - Do you know Pisa? - I've been there. - Does it look like that? - Absolutely. - Well, that's Lisbon. - Davis is hung over, bless him. - Ingrid's not wearing a bra. - Do you see them, in the back, those giant crabs? - In Madagascar, those are everywhere. - In Madeira, we might find clams and carpet shells. - Don't you find her exuberant? - Who? - Nicky. - She's a character. Do you see someone else for the part of the young girl? - Katia, a model from last night's gala. That's right, you weren't there. - She's just starting out. - Oh, starting out rather well. - Meow. - Eléonore, here's your Katia. - Is this really Katia? Pleased to meet you, Miss. Madame San-Réal. I'd like to know, is your contract exclusive? Ah, excellent. Do you like Austria? Then stop by Mr. Marsay's office. Let's say noon. Alright. See you then. - Mrs. Eléonore San-Réal, Katia. - I'm confused. - Very young, that's what you were looking for. Hello, Marsay. Who? Ah! Calm down, I can't understand a word. - I didn't think she'd show up. The Lyon station, of course! Right, so what do I do? - Set your watch. Okay. See you tonight. - Attention, mister. Your lines! Let's start over! - Alas… No, turn it down please. I'm not 20 anymore. "An egotist, preoccupied with himself, is preoccupied with silliness, insignificant little things." "And what's a woman?" - No. No, no, no… "And what's a woman?" - What do you think? - I'm asking you. - A little thing. A bunch of silliness. - That's you talking? - No, Balzac. "With 2 words, don't we make her slave away for 4 hours?" - There, you bend over. You kiss her on the shoulder, and you whisper. - "She's sure the egotist will give her attention." "For he does not give attention to great people." - You don't seem convinced. - I'll look like a cretin. - Paul will be overjoyed. - In any case, I'm going to be bored. - Since I won't be there, you'll drink too much. - As usual, I'll flub my lines. - Mrs. San-Réal? - I'll be right there. Tickets, passports. The plane's at 10. I'm counting on you. - Here. You wanted to know who Paul is? He's like a dog, who follows me around and takes inspiration from me. Paul de Manerville. Once a year, he blows money on a costume ball. Last year, the theme was Ancient Rome. You've got to make up your mind. Are you afraid, or just running for show? You came, I saw you, now I'm not leaving your side. Looks like I'll have to protect you. Me, I adore women. I comb them, wash them, Hang them out to dry with clothespins. I do laundry, basically. A real houseman. You're different though. - You sure try hard. - I know, I know... always searching. Even if things are within reach. I saw you at the station. - Were you there? - I didn't dare to approach you. I'm a little old-fashioned. - Were you there? You weren't. - No, so what? You get comfortable in my car, wait for me under the clock, then cross my path here again... Don't leave. - Wouldn't it be good if you'd love me. - But I do love you... Claudine? I love your name, don't you? Josiane, I'm sure that I love you. You don't believe me? - No. - Of course not, it's all about tone. One shouldn't say "I love you, Elisabeth", it should be "Elisabeth, I love you." I either die, or latch on. You wouldn't leave me out here in this weather? Barbara! - Please, don't shout. I don't live here alone. - You let me in to tell me that? Léa. Here I am in the heart of the room. My old strategist's experience tells me… Tells me that… I remember, it was in 1830, or '31 maybe. Anyway! The day after Austerlitz, or Waterloo, whatever. We were waiting for Grouchy, but got Godot. Hard times. I lead my 6th cavalry regiment into the city of Clamecy or Arras, no importance. They accommodate me. Let me warm up. I fall asleep! When suddenly… - Are you thirsty? - I'm parched! - What are you drinking, colonel? - Lots. A mirage! An oasis! The promised land! Canaan! Praise God! And the beautiful flowing waters! To "Napo", the second! To Alexander, brave old companion! What do you do? - Me? I'm just watching you. I mean in life, as they say. - I work. - Ah. Do you make a lot of money? - I'm studying. - Hmm. Oh la la. You read! - Yes. - You read too much! No, not too much. You read badly, inappropriately! Do you love me, Catherine ? - Yes. - It's a mistake. I've done everything to prove my love to you. Wrong! I've done everything to love you. In truth… I don't love you. And I will not love you. Not even… Not even if your name was Martine. And most of all… most of all… I wouldn't want to love you. Sleep… - What time is it? - 9:30. - You couldn't have told me? - You needed to sleep. - Maternal, as well! - Can I make you a coffee? - My jacket. - In the bathroom. - Huh? Oh la la, don't I look great. - Urgent business? - Five girls to get through customs. - I'm not sure I have milk. - Hey, the razor, chop chop. - Huh? - Never mind… Oh! - Chabert ! - Very honored! - Come into my arms, Honoré! - Imbecile! - Thou shalt not pass! - Give me a break! - Ye gods, what a beautiful mare! - That's enough! - What's going on? - Come on, we're leaving! - And the watchword? - Thou shalt not pass! The plane's waiting. - Plane? - Austria, remember? - But you abandoned me last night. - Hurry! - I don't care about catching your plane! - No kidding. - Nasty brute. - Oh look, there's Henri. - Oh look, there's Paul. - A little coffee? One for the road. - Won't I look terrible? - Join the club. - You left her here and disappeared. - I had too much to drink. - True. - So you tucked her in… - Never! - Thou shalt not pass! - Let the mare through! - My shoes, my shoes! - I look like an old rag. - Off to a good start… - I'm going to cry. - Don't touch that! - I didn't pack a toothbrush! - Or tweezers, I bet. - What will I do? - Your papers! - Sorry... We have to catch that plane right now. Look, I don't have them on me right now. You're a funny one! - Mr. Marsay is absent, you've reached his answering machine. Please leave your message. - Hello, Henri. It's Davis. I just got back, put the girls to bed, I'm going for a nap myself now, I'll stop by later in the evening. Bye-bye. - Mr. Marsay is absent, you've reached his answering machine. Please leave your message. - Véronique, Chantal, Marie-José, will be waiting for Henri Marsay at 17:00 at La Bûcherie, on the Rue de la Bûcherie. - What time have you got? Are you reading? What are you reading? I haven't read that, myself. Can I buy you anything? - Don't cry, my child. Don't move. What's your name, Martine ? - Elisabeth. - You're lying.… Véronique. You've met temptation. - Yes. - Did you give in? - No. - So you resisted. - No. - Go. And sin in peace. Do you lie often? - This was the first time. - I didn't love him, I swear I didn't love him. I love you. I don't even remember his name. - Liar. - I never loved him, not for a second. - The first one is me. - No, Henri, not you. - Who then? - Our parents opposed the marriage, so we left, Herman and me. - Like real grown-ups. - Yes. We embarked in Nantucket. - Nantucket? - Well, yes, Nantucket. - Oh right, a whaling ship, wasn't it? - The Pequod. Captain Ahab, to be precise. I'll show you the waves, the glaciers. It was wonderful. I leaned over the side and the sperm whales ate out of my hand. - Woman overboard! - Herman dove into the water to rescue me. - And he swam, and swam. - Like a fish. He was swallowed. - Whole? - And after that? - I continued my studies. - And this, what's this? - A lion. - You should call a cat a cat. And this? - Books. - Exact. And there? - Mirror. - And behind the door? And how about this? - Money. - Do you earn it or steal it? - Nosy. - What's behind the door? - Stairs. - Very well. Where do they lead? - To the castle. You don't know what it's like for a little girl. To wake up alone, in a practically deserted castle. - Where's prince charming? - That's you. - Oh… I'm too old for that. - In that case, it's me. You'll look great in this. - You're crazy. - Come on, play along! - Oh! - Wait. Move over. And… - Oh! You're nuts. And it's falling off. - No, no. - You'll strangle me. - I hope so. - This can't be happening! - Go on, sleep. Sleep! - On my white horse I crossed the snow-covered forest. I stopped at the sleeping castle. Are you asleep? - Yes, sleeping. - Quiet then. Everything has to be asleep. The staircases, the hallways, the slaves. The doors open in front of me, without a sound. I lean over… Brush my lips against hers. And the princess awakes. Henri, are you listening? - I felt nothing. - Okay, so I lean… - And you fall. - I love you. - You wear me out, my love. You tire me with all of your voyages, your laces, your old men, your princely life. All that is out of date! - Be quiet, Henri. - Your father was a notary's clerk in a small provincial town. Your mother always darning the same old socks. "Yes, madam, my daughter's in Paris." "At the Sorbonne, getting her literature degree." "She's staying with her aunt, my husband's sister." - You have too much imagination. - Coming from you, that's flattering. - I'm not hiding anything. - Come on, give me the key. - The little fish ate it. - Christine, Virginie, Caroline, and what else? What are you called? What is your name? It's a simple question. You're a student, you're not making a living. So how do you eat? Who's giving you money? Do you understand? - I love you, is that not enough? - Henri Marsay wants to know who he's sleeping with. - With me, Henri. - Calm down, my little bird in the rain. There, there… Easy. Calm down. - It's funny. I've never been up here. - I did it twice a day for 10 years. With just the sun in the morning, and a woman in the evening. - Ah! The joy of a good cigar. That's one thing a man will never get tired of. Have you ever flown, Paul? - Yes. - Ever dropped bombs? - No. - You see, if you release them here, they land over there. Shake your ashes, Paul, shake! They'll fly towards Puteaux, Suresnes, Courbevoie. Shake, Paul! Shake! Get them everywhere, so everyone gets a piece of the pie. Shake some on Neuilly too, you'll spread that nice odor that it is you're smoking. My word. Man is a buffoon. Will you think of the dogs, Paul? - You can't be serious? - Very. - I don't understand you. - We made a bet, you lost. - I'll buy them back from you then. - How much? - 50.000. - Deal. - Okay, I'll have it tomorrow. - Right now. - But I don't have it on me. - Write me a check. - But… - Ah, spying on me? - No, just waiting for you. - Are we going to our place? - I thought we were going to my place. - I'll only be a minute. - I'm coming along. - To spy on me? - No, to accompany you. Henri, will you turn on the lights? Henri, where are you? I'm scared now. You happy? Come on, you can't see a thing in here. Henri? Henri, I'm scared. - Give me your hand. - Is this you? - What? - Over there, that's you? - No, it's her. - Who, "her" ? - Pretty, huh. - Who is she? Come on, her name. It's a simple question. Do you like Corelli? - Very much. To Austria, please. - I love Corelli. - That's your prerogative. - The number? - Dial 10-6-38-02. Austria. Hôtel de l'Alpe. - Excuse me? De l'Alpe! At Innsbruck. Person-to-person. - Person-to-person. - For Mrs. San-Réal. - Is that two words? - Eléonore San-Réal. - San-Réal… - That's it, thanks. Don't be silly, she's a friend. My best friend. Léo! Just a friend. - Hello, we've reached Mrs. San-Réal. - Hello? Hello, Léo? - Hi. - How are you? - Up to my neck in snow. - I'm at your place. - And? - Yes! Yes, it's arrived. - Did I understand correctly? - Yes, I shipped it to New York right away. You like Corelli, right? - That's my prerogative. - Here. - Hello? Oh, hello. Hello? - You're mean. - Don't worry. She'll call back. - I don't want her to. You see, I don't want us to be disturbed. We're at home, here. - You're overreacting. - Why? - Maybe it was for me. - Did you give anyone my number? - No, in fact. So, it was for you. She's going to be furious, you know. - Who? Who's going to be furious? - Daddy's wife. - Ah! Are you jealous? - Sound too good to be true, doesn't it? And you're right, I'm not jealous. - You're curious then. - Why? You have no secrets for me. - Henri, not again. Are you not happy? - His name? It's a simple question. But you're scared. - Let go of me, Henri ! - I can tell something scares you, but what? - Don't touch me! - You're scared to death. - Take me away, Henri. Far. Real far. - To Beijing? Or to Nantucket? Or no, I know, the sleeping forest. We could sleep standing up, what do you say? Better yet. We could ask old Jonathan for asylum. - Your place, Henri. - Now there's an idea, my place. Right away, are you ready? - You can keep me close to you. Hide me. Marry me, Henri. - Marry who? - Me. - But who are you then? Véronique, Virginie, Josiane, or Marie-Valentine? "Mr. Marsay, do you take Ms. …?" That won't work, you see? Wedding canceled. Give me 24 hours to say my goodbyes to life as a bachelor. - Henri! - That's me. - I'll die. - Got everything you need? I'll say… - Henri, be quiet! Quiet, Henri. Talk to me. Do what you want of me, kill me! But stop laughing. - The court finds you guilty of concealment, premeditated lies, grave and disorderly exaggeration of feelings, parody of affection. - I love you, Henri. That's the truth. I never lied to you. - I apologize for not bringing a silk garrote. - Will you be sad, afterward? - You think? I have no memory. - Kill me, Henri. Kill me! - Classic female obsession, of literary origin. May God have mercy on your soul. Very, very pretty. Well, well. - Hey, big boy. - Did everything go well? - I wouldn't be here otherwise. - True, I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow. - Here. To be developed, top priority. Trouble? - Oh, you can't imagine. You can't imagine. Here, look. - Where'd you find her? - I didn't find her, I made her. - And what are your plans with her? A white wedding, that's what she was cooking up. - What's up, don't feel like playing? - Doesn't matter, there's no answer. - I don't even know her name. And I don't mean her last name. Her first name. - You broke it off, that's all that matters. - Bless you, Léo. You don't know the best part yet. Last night, I went over there. That's right, I didn't tell you… A nice little hotel. With a hidden door, like Ali Baba's cave. And guess what I found. You'll never guess. Dresses, you see? Nothing but dresses. - So what? You didn't suspect as much? Don't forget the negatives. Willy's waiting, it's costing us. The mist makes all the charm, don't you think? Do you come here often? "It's the first time, madam." Every piece of roofing's like a scale. When the wind moves the clouds, I see a rampant monster. Don't you? I'm sure I could show you where your house is. Where do you live? "Nowhere yet, I just got here." Are you staying long? - Léo… - And now? Where will you go if you leave? - I'm a monster. - Monsters are charming. Every child knows that. - I'm not a child anymore. - Why are you crying, then? - I love him, Léo. - My sweetheart. My dove. It's only a whim. - I wanted to die. But I didn't have the courage. - You're so light. The wind could carry you way. - Léo… I'm a coward. I'm a coward. I despise myself. - Do you see those gulls? That's a boat taking us away from here. - I won't leave. - Is it that bad? - I love him, you have to understand. - What makes you think that I don't understand? - He's not like the others. - He's tough. Cynical. Brutal. - He's shy. - Always, when he's scared. Can't you see you scared him? - I'm sure he was sincere. - He's a player. Everything's a game to him. Even you. - I love him, Léo. What can I do? - You're not a child anymore, you told me that yourself. Why don't you call him? - I only know you. I only trust you. - You need to let time do its work. Go away, disappear. What a mess. You could have tidied up a little. - Where is she? - Don't ask me that. - Why not? - Have some dignity. You're Henri Marsay. You broke it off, didn't you? - You'd like that! - You got scared. She was too sincere for you. - It's her who was scared. Scared of you, your phone calls, scared of herself! - Stop it, you'll make Margaux cry. - Sorry, but it's your fault. I didn't know your bachelor pad. It's appalling! - I'm free to choose my decor. - One wouldn't want to play here. - That's what you did though. And with talent. - Believe me, it was needed! Your shine's hurting my eyes. Léo, you need to air this place. It's suffocating in here. She was suffocating, that girl. You smooth-talked her, with your stupid pretty words! - You have a thing against poetry. - You needed a little performing animal that knew only you. You, Mrs. Eléonore San-Réal, your hand and your treats! I have no words. Or maybe I do. It's murder. You hear me? Murder. You disappoint me. - She came here from her little province, Henri. - So you took pity. - What destiny do you think awaited her here? - You want to tell me about a maid's room, with water all over the floor? - No. About a boy. - What boy? - The student who would have gotten her pregnant on the first night. - No such risk with you, of course. - You don't say. - And you're proud of it? - No, I hid it. That's what you're holding against me. - I never hid anything from you. - Your bedroom has a revolving door, that's no secret. And you boast about it. - Does the honesty bother you? - No, the lack of decency. - You're confusing decency with hypocrisy. And I thought you had lovers. Baron Gilbert, Mr. Vigne, The charming colonel Von Keff... They stayed at the foot of the bed? - In Paris, you go out with a man three times and people think you're an item. - We've known each other for 10 years. turns out I didn't know you at all. - Well, you never really tried to, did you my dear Henri. For 10 years, I've been your loyal accomplice. Today, you happen to be in love, so… I'm a woman. You're at my place. Ask me for her hand, nicely. - How should I proceed? - Are you ready? Comb your hair, you look like a griffon. Waiter! What does she owe you? - 1.20 francs, madam. - Mailing out your goodbyes? - It's already stamped. - "My love, Henri, my darling, my sweetheart, I'm leaving, but with a broken heart." Come on, tear that up. He'd burst out laughing. You don't know what he's like. You'll need some less vulgar stationery, for starters. Come on, rip it. - Henri, I know how much my childishness must have annoyed you. You should have met me by chance, and not because I came to meet you. I should have known your habits. Eléonore told me so much about you. Maybe I should have just sat and waited on the terrace of a café. You don't love me. I'll try to convince myself of that. You can help me by not trying to see me again. Allow me to continue writing you, even though you shouldn't answer. I dreamt of this church where you made me confess to my first lies. I dream of other lies, terrifying lies, that I'm dead. That your tears pierce the ground on my grave, touch me and wake me up. It's hard to tell myself that I can't see you again. - He's hesitating, thinking about you. He's never thought about you this much before. I told you he'd show up. He's suffering. It's the first time he's suffering. He's happy. You have nothing to feel guilty about. - Bravo, my dear master. Say, what's the sentence for illegal shadowing? - That's all well and good, but I'm celebrating my 100th show tonight. - That's against our rules. - Here, I found this in the blue zone. - Take it easy, children. - Ready, boys? - We want the lady's name. - Eléonore. - Here's to her. - Ready, boys? Five, four, three, two… one, zero. We'll give her a flat tire. Then you can simply give her a ride. - Trouble, madam? - Yes, a puncture. - Are you available? - I'm headed back to Vincennes. - Too bad. Unless you could stop by a garage. - Depends where. - Champerret. - I'll take it. - Hello, yes? - I'm freezing. No, I'm not calling to tell you that. It didn't work. Eléonore, yes. To a garage. Have someone else take over, because I… - A big splash and then straight to the bottom. There, all we have to do is wait, with our windshield wipers on. The fish… will come and lock their thick lips to the glass and watch our kisses. - I shiver, and you turn on the heat. I teach you a lesson and on our lips, you repeat with yours: "My soft-eyed woman, perhaps in prison." - No, Katiouchka, it's One Thousand and One Nights, get it? There, that's better. Sleep well, big boy? - I had a bad dream. I took a dive in my car. - That's a nightmare. You drink too much. Are we having dinner tonight? - I don't know if I'll be hungry. - You can have a drink. - At your place? - My house. You know where now. - Which one? - The other one. I don't keep secrets anymore. - Thanks. I know this. What is it? - Think. - A third of champagne, some gin. A hint of Marasca, is it? I haven't had one of these in a long time. - 10 years. - I've got it. A grain of salt. - No. A drop of seawater. - You used to call it "Deauville sunrise". - Ah.… You remember. We had dinner at Lipp's. You wanted to go swimming at all costs. - Not at all. You wanted to eat carpet shells. - Anyway, we had to break in your car. - It was raining non stop. You passed the time making cocktails. - And you, drinking them. - Was I drunk? - Very drunk. You let me down. - Job well done. - I drove on the way back. Do you recall? - No. Where is she? - Excuse me? - I said, where is she? - Ah, yes. That's right. You were about to ask me for her hand in marriage. - I'm asking you where you're hiding her. - But she's free. Free as the air. She can come running to you, if she wants. - What's with those letters? - It's crazy how contradictory you are. I can't stop her from writing you. I told you, she's free. - And this little soirée? A great idea, really. And this silly game, huh? Between us, what does it mean? - Between us, it's about love. Don't you know that song? - Please, Léo. Where is she? I need to see her. Open up in there! Open up! - Henri, everything's swaying… I'm seasick… - They can say whatever they want, the tallest waves are always downwind. - It's the only way out. - Stop it. - You're a novice! This would be difficult even if you had all your composure. - Aye aye, captain. So captain, is the mist clearing away? - There's land in sight. Mama! - Bad weather… - No, no, no! Can you put me back, corporal? - Sit down. Please, sit down. Are you sitting? Do you need anything? - A scotch. - Neat? - Neat. - Tell me, Léo, where is she? - What's going on? - Something that will interest you. - What is it? - Put something on, it could get chilly. - Stop! - Jump, why don't you! - Pleased with yourself? - Not entirely unsatisfied. - Will you give me 10 minutes? - Of course. - Hey. - He's there. Outside. Waiting for you. - Thank you, Léo. - I had nothing to do with it. - Are you hurting? - You're free. - I love him, Léo. - So your mind's made up? You're leaving? - I love him, Léo. Like I've never loved anyone. - Léo! - I love you.
