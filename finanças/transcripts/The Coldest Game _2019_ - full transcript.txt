[menacing music] [applause] [indistinct voice speaking] [breathes heavily] [clock ticking] [high-pitched sound] [sound dies] [man] What came first? The chicken or the egg? It’s important to see things as they are. On one hand you have an awkward feathered thing and on the other you have the most perfect aerodynamic shape that's ever evolved. The answer is... answer is obvious, right? Everything’s simple with you, professor. Maybe you can explain my wife to me. - It was the egg, not the chicken, right? - That depends. On what? On whether I'm having breakfast or dinner. [laughing] Get out of here, professor. [menacing music] We now know that the Soviet Union has decided for putting all of the Americans - [blast] - under the nuclear gun. Their major weapon systems, which would affect this capability, appear to be nuclear propelled and supersonic bombers. The aggressor would go as far as he could, to the very brink of war. Kennedy said that their administration must take responsibility for the loss of Cuba. The free people of Cuba, people who want to be free are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom. In international news the chess match of the century between grand master John Konigsberg and the Soviet challenger grand master Gavrylov has finally been scheduled. The Chairman of the American Chess Association, Mr. Griswald Moran, made this announcement. I would like to personally thank President Kennedy, who spoke to First Secretary Khrushchev on our behalf and helped us come to an agreement with the Soviets. The date of the tournament remains unchanged. Both sides have agreed to hold the games in Warsaw, Poland. Yeah, well. I can't play with all that crap in my ears. All they've been talking about for the past two days is Konigsberg and that Russian, as though that’s going to bring the Commies to their knees. Dealer takes one. Did you guys hear about that Russian bomb called Tsar? - All in. - [professor] They exploded one and the mushroom cloud was 40 miles high. - All in. - Manhattan would be destroyed in... two seconds. And I call. Gentlemen. That's always a pleasure. Three hundred and 32 dollars. So my 15 percent would be 49 dollars and 80 cents. Here's 50 bucks. This Saturday we're going to play blackjack. [bartender] You are going to lose the first two rounds and then make a miraculous recovery. You got it. Evening, miss. What'll it be? Double bourbon. Neat. Professor Mansky? You crossed my mind today when I heard about that chess match between that Russian and Konigsberg. I remember when you were playing him. Everybody admired you. I was your student. That was a long time ago. Professor, I have a proposition for you. Pardon me. Excuse me? I think you forgot your... [Mansky grunts] He’s waking up. He needs another shot. [man] He’s not due for another 45. [woman] He’s got a strong liver. [fraught music] He woke up half an hour ago in the safe room. He doesn't know where he is. We waited for you before talking to him. Taught math at Princeton. During Einstein’s tenure, no less. Dismissed for punching a Nobel laureate. You brought a winner. He’s a genius at chess, sir. He defeated Konigsberg twice. Yeah, 20 years ago. And this is the guy you want to win the Cold War for us? [buzzing] [woman] Go ahead. [buzzing continues] [man 1] Professor Mansky, can you hear me? I taught for nine years. I never had a female student. [man 1] What I'm about to tell you, sir, is highly confidential. The President and the State Department... You'd come up with the genius plan. - We have a lot to tell you... - You gonna tell me that I should pretend to be Konigsberg or maybe ask me to send messages about different moves he can make by tapping Morse code by the teaspoon or something. And this all in the name of the State Department and the President of the United States, and it happens in a sound-proofed box. - Guess what? I'm not interested. - Impressive. Everything you said is true. But there’s more. Konigsberg suffered a stroke a few days ago. He’s dead and nobody knows about it. A loophole in the regulations allows us to replace him with another player. The Russians have to accept or they face a forfeit. There is no plan B. We need you to be a patriot. Oh God. That word. Hey. Why isn't my cell touching the ground? You're worried about what’s underneath us. We're not on home territory, are we? No, professor. That’s the other thing. We're in a safe room, U.S. Embassy, Warsaw. [loud buzzing] [menacing music] This just came in. Encrypted, code orange. We're not thirsty. The Soviet's ship will dock earlier in Cuba. We have only four days and Konigsberg’s autopsy shows traces of ricin in his system. The same kind the Soviets use. If he was poisoned, that means the Soviets know about our mission, - so we have a mole in Washington. - I need to know every detail - of this operation. - You know the protocol, agent Novak. I don't even have all the details. Agent White is gonna contact our source, - I will support him, you will protect us. - We're buying time. Even if Mansky loses the first three games, that gives us five days to contact John Gift. You understand you're risking more than my men or this station. They hang people here for this kind of business. The convoy approaching Cuba may indicate change in the Soviet strategy and an unannounced, rapid attack using medium-range missiles deployed on the island, which would break U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere and shorten retaliation time to four minutes. Mr. Mansky? Professor? May we come in? [Mansky] You know I will agree to play. Who told you what happened in 1945? What do you mean? [Mansky] You don’t know. Can we brief you about today? [Mansky] You want me to win, I gotta get some rest. - We leave at 3:00. - [Mansky] Go away. [secretary] Mr. Novak, sir... Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. Please, I recognize you all from your passport photos. My name's Donald Novak. I am the embassy attaché in charge of your stay in Warsaw. You've been briefed on the plane about our difficult situation. We've decided to keep the Soviets in the dark to the last minute. We will arrive just before the opening ceremony begins. And then, Mr. Moran will present them with the announcement. - We'll see what they decide. - Thank you. As chairman of the American Chess association... [Novak] Excuse me. [whispering] Sir, we have a problem. You need to be in a guest room. Dr. Stone and Mr. White from Life Magazine. [Novak] Could you come with me, please? We've had an issue with their visas. We’ll be just a minute. [dynamic music] Professor? Christ, not another one. [Stone] He’s alive. He’s alive, alright and three sheets to the goddamn wind. [White] Phenobarbital. We are lucky his heart is still beating. [sighs] [White] An amphetamine derivative. We won World War II thanks to this. It’ll put a spring in your step. - It’ll take effect faster if you gum it. - [mutters] - I don't get anything... - Ok. Just give it a moment. [folk music] [rhythmic clapping] [applause] [in Polish] Bravo! The Mazowsze folk band! How long does it last, this stuff? Everything looks strange. What’s that? This will be our home for the next few days. [Stone] It's The Palace of Culture and Science. Stalin’s gift to the people of Poland. - [man shouting commands] - [birds croak] [in Polish] Ladies and gentlemen! I would like to welcome Yuri Siergeyevich Gavrylov, representing the U.S.S.R., to the stage! [applause] [in Russian] Thank you! May this chess match, played in the heroic city of Warsaw, aide in the perseverance of peace and friendship among nations. - Thank you! - [in Polish] Bravo! Thank you for those wonderful words. Your statement. The Soviet Chess Committee agrees to your substitute player. [stutters] What about Grandmaster Gavrylov? He'll agree as well. [in Polish] I will now read a statement I just received from the American delegation. Here we go. Here we go. [in Polish] We regret to announce that the US representative, grand master Konigsberg, has passed away. As stated in the ordinance of the International Chess Federation, either side has the right to appoint a replacement if the replacement was the last one to defeat the original contender in a sanctioned match. Grandmaster Konigsberg was defeated 17 years ago by professor... [slowly] Joshua Mansky. Before I invite professor Mansky to the stage, I would like to propose a moment of silence to honor the late grand master Konigsberg. [camera shutter sounds] Since the Soviet delegation is not protesting, we can move on to the symbolic first move of the tournament, which will begin tomorrow! There will be five games. Each game that's won is worth a point. A draw is worth half a point for each player. The first player to reach three points will walk away the victor! As agreed, grand master Gavrylov will make the first move and will use the white pieces. And now, the representative of the United States, Mr. Mansky. Your answer, sir. [in English] Your answer, sir. What the fuck. Once more for your pleasure: the Mazowsze band! [folk music] [in French] A dramatic turn of events in a match deemed more important than the World Championship! [in Russian] Office. Write down! [in German] Joshua Mansky, a wunderkind that debuted at 13... [in Russian] Gavrylov was not provoked by the Americans' deceptive tactics... I was going to apply the I.V., when professor Mansky grabbed the rubbing alcohol and drank it. His reaction was out of the ordinary to say the least. He calmed down and became focused. I pass it he needs psychoactive agents to block the communication between his dendrites and neurons in his brain. The alcohol straightened him out, slowed down his brain activity to that of a normal person. So, you say normally he’s not normal? In the same way that you could say Einstein wasn't normal. [breathes nervously] [White] Professor? We're almost done. There's nothing to worry about. - You're doing a great job. - I need a drink. [man] Our Palace is radiating over Warsaw, has 46 floors, three thousand 288 rooms, theaters, swimming pools, and museum of technology. As the director of Palace of Culture and Science, I like to greet our visitors with respectable traditional offering... Welcome and good night. [director] Professor. Traditional offering starts with bread and salt. And, of course, welcome drink. Professor, we have of course army of people for our guest. But for great masters like professor, I personally take care. Someone from the embassy will bring a suitcase with everything you might need. I really don't know what happened out there. He made his first move, I thought of about 8900 responses. - I haven't been playing very much lately. - [Stone] You did well today. Try to get some sleep. It might come down to the Rousseau or the Two Knights defense. Do you know what the difference is? There isn't any. And that worries me. We've got a big day tomorrow. [door opens] [footsteps] [in Russian] Good evening. - [in Russian] You probably know who I am. - I do. Good. What they say is true: a man's name precedes him. And whatever you heard I am, I am just that. Well, maybe... a little worse. [laughing] Do the Americans like their rooms? Very much so. Will you be the best host to our guests? This is Poland. Hospitality runs in our blood. And it will as long as it does not disturb the friendship among our nations. Goodbye. Thank you for extending the use of your office during my stay. - I'm glad I could help. - Today was a good day. Tomorrow will be a better one. Check what they're saying on the American floor. Yes, General Major. [grunts] Professor. It’s 11:30 p.m., not a.m. What happened? What happened with what? That director came over with breakfast. Morning, it's good breakfast. Voilà. ...and we had this cultural exchange. Best juice for breakfast is not from orange, but from... potato. [cheerful music] What happened with the game? Professor, you won. I won? [crowd cheering] It was incredible. They called it a "classic knockout". Gavrylov gave up after 32 moves. [Stone] At the very beginning, you sacrificed a knight for Gavrylov’s bishop. [Mansky] And then I sacrificed my bishop for his knight. And then you took his queen and immediately he took yours. And I gave up my knight, Gavrylov gave up his other bishop and we both ended up with a rook. So, you do remember? Not at all. - Can I have a beer? Please. - Of course. Thank you. I think I'm beginning to understand. - What? - You. [clock ticking] [Stone] You gave away the rook and your other bishop. You were impervious to his moves and didn't attack any of his pieces. Everyone thought you are going mad. But then, you made one move and it all made sense. It was unbelievable. Everyone screamed. Moran said, "We just witnessed history in the making." I think you're underestimating yourself, but I always believed in you. You're quite the genius. You would have made a good student. But I think... I got to have a beer for the road, if you don't mind. Thank you. Good night, professor. Good night. [man in Russian] He swears he was so drunk he wasn't even conscious. Never underestimate a man that can drink you under the table. Anything else? Comrade Gavrylov asked to see you. Interesting. And bold on his part. [buzzing] [Krutov] Come in! [in Russian] Dear Yuri Sergeyevich! Why the sad demeanor? Chess isn't the five-year plan. You can't foresee everything. One can argue that it's good that you lost. Your inevitable victory must come from a hard battle. Otherwise, what will winning be worth? [in Russian] I understand. There's something else. After the first few moves, I thought he was some... Buffoon. [chuckles] Don't look at him this way. See him as a part of a greater whole. I know I disappointed you. I've already learned an important lesson. The Party is behind you and the Party will always help you. We are fighting for the freedom of humanity. The truth can only belong to us. Thank you, comrade Krutov. Sasha. Get the Palace Director on the phone. Not a chess player, but a whiny little cunt. Good morning, comrade director. To make sure we keep chess as the highest priority of this game, I'd like you to stop providing alcohol to the American delegation's quarters. They might complain later that we won because we got them drunk. That's an order! [jazz music] [stuttering] I don’t really do this. No. Men of a distinguished age look good on you, Dr. Stone. Excuse me, professor. The ambassadors aren’t coming. A reporter in Washington got the White House leak and asked Khrushchev point-blank about missiles in Cuba. He must have got pissed. He is threatening to pull his ambassador from D.C. - Any contact with Gift? - Negative. Any contact with anyone? Some Soviet officer drifting off by himself? We're under a time constraint. - How long do we have? - 48 hours. What about the mole in Washington? Let’s just worry about Gift, then about the mole. [Krutov speaks Russian indistinctly] Wait. See the guy that the Russians are standing around? General Major Krutov. He’s Russian counterintelligence, responsible for the sting operation in Moscow. When did you plan on telling me that? Maybe this is a good moment to start breaking procedure - and tell each other what we know. - I can't give any details of my mission - to anyone, even you. - Can he recognize you? If he could, I'd be dead in Moscow like the others. I'll see you at the game tomorrow. - Excuse me, gentlemen. It's time to go. - I guess that means the party’s over. A lot of things are over. - We have to get back to the Palace. - If you would just excuse me. - I'll get a little food for the road. - Nobody asked me... What's going on here? - [Stone] It’s okay. - [White] They're showing who’s in charge. It’s okay. [in Polish] Let them go! Move it! [Novak] The US has begun military maneuvers designed to hide the fact that our entire army on the east coast is been mobilized. Our ambassador here is ready to evacuate. All classified papers are to be burnt. The Warsaw Pact has put its troops on military alert. The Soviets have already sent more than twenty ships towards Cuba, all of them are carrying radioactive cargo. The U.S. Navy has designated a zone that the Russian convoy cannot cross. It looks like war. [gong rings] [clock ticking] [Novak] How’s our dark horse? Not bad. God protects children, drunks, and the United States, as they say. I hope that’s true and he doesn't fail us. [Stone] Mansky will be fine. I was talking about God. I’m sorry. [in Russian] Genadiy Stepanovich, the rat will show his head in the next 48 hours. We're counting on you. [in Russian] The Americans recognized you. [in Russian] Good. They'll have something to be afraid of. [Moran] He's ahead again. t's like in the first game. [clock ticking] [indistinct whispers] Those moves were strange. Like he changed his whole strategy. I'm gonna walk down to him during the break. [indistinct whispers] [pants] [in Polish] Bravo. Today's winner is the grand master Gavrylov. This happened in Switzerland. They hired a hypnotist to distract our player. Let’s go! Your wife is due to deliver any day. You have a family, daddy. [breathes heavily] If I understand correctly, your job is to protect our player. - Please... - And what you don't understand is to win this match the Soviets... What you did was unacceptable! - [in Russian] Accept the defeat. - Take your hands off me! How dare you? [men screaming] Stop! No! [director in Russian] No! You can't! Checkmate! The lift's waiting. Chess. Good manners. [typewriter clicking] [Polish song playing] They even know she’s pregnant. Don’t worry. We'll find Gift and we'll be out of here. - You'll go back home to your wife. - I saw him. You saw Gift? When? Before I got stopped. This is good. That means he’s in Warsaw. How can we identify him? I’d have to contact headquarters. I understand. [knocking] [louder knocking] [knocking repeats] [loud knocking] [director] The bar. Goodnight. [in Polish] Pure. Varsovian. [laughter] - Toilet! - Secret system of communication. My idea. One, two, three, four. Number three. Medicine for morning. After chess... or during. Come. [shushes] Stop. Come! [director] Germans destroy everything. Hitler’s personal order. To destroy. But we build it again. I am starting to see some lights. I show you, here look. [Director] Ehm. Here. Palace of Culture, big river, Wisła... and here American Embassy. It's okay... D4, F6, C4, E5, E6.. You play chess always. C5, D5... B5. [director laughs] - The Blumenfeld Gambit. - Bruderschaft. I show you. Polish tradition. Vodka and now drink. - And kiss. One, two, tree. - [grunts] Alfred. My name, Alfred. Joshua. - Joszek. - Why, Alfred? Why do you take this risk? It's so much trouble. Joszek, you're a good man. You are my guest. I show you my Warszawa. [energetic music] We are two floors underground. And upstairs is stage where you play with Gavrylov. [director] Our history of Poland very complicated. All time between Germans and Russia, fighting for freedom. I was communist before war and I am proud of it. But... I never believed Stalin, never. [director] And now these servants of Soviets made me? In my own country? Director of their Palace of Culture? [laughs loudly] Me, colonel of underground army! Welcome to Warsaw. How we call, "the Paris of the North." [director in Polish] Oh, here. [in English] Children, women, civilians here. And there... 15 German soldiers. Me and my gun only. [director] Only one gun. So, I shot. Bam, bang. [dog barks] Eight German bastards dead. The rest run. Women and children... survived. The Soviets wait on the other side of river for half year. Half year. [director] Not giving us any help. Looking, as Germans... As Germans... [in Polish] How do you say, "bleed us dry"? Fuck. [in English] Joszek... you cannot imagine. Dead bodies everywhere. I lost my faith. I don't really know the things you saw, maybe little with the... in terms of the whole game only sacrifice can bring you great strength. Really. I lost my soul. This is mad world, Joszek. You must be careful. Trust me. - [shot fired] - [in Polish] Militia! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Clean. Give the comrade his gun back. I'd like to sincerely apologize. I'll write a grievance report on myself. - I have a wife and kids. A flat... - [in Polish] Attention! About face! Get the fuck out of here! [cackles] They run like fascist. [director cackles] [director] We are here. Almost here. [accordion playing] Mietek! - Fredek! - Mieciu! [in Polish] Hi. Oh, my sweet. You have a lot of friends here. [in English] They are good people. - And they cheer for you. Not that Rusek. - [moans] [in Polish] Excuse me. I've brought you beef goulash. I made it myself. - [in Polish] Won't you introduce me? - Professor. [in English] This is Gienia and she is my... She's nice and... [in English] I love America and James Dean. [in Polish] I'll bring you better vodka. [Gienia] Kryśka! Get me the special one! Tell your friend he should not take the next card because statistically, he’s not going to get a face card. - How do you know? - I know, right now! [man in Polish] Damn it! It's the fourth time! Joszek, you're amazing. We drink and I'm drunk... [snorts] you're drunk and still genius. How do you do it? Pure math and pure vodka. Maybe you wanna play? [telephone ringing] [grunts] Hallo? [grunts] [Mansky's grunts on the tape recorder] - Hey. - Good morning, professor. How are you? I'm... Fine. Left these outside your door last night. You weren't thirsty? I hadn't got to them. Are you alright? - Yup, I am well. - Aha. [whispering] The others don’t know I’m here. Oh. - I see. - Do you mind if I seat down? Sure. - Are you ready for today’s game? - I have been preparing... Why don't you open up a beer? Okay. [whispering] During the game, someone might approach you could be in a Soviet uniform, but he’s a friend. Besides me, the only other person he knows he can trust is you. How about if I open up another beer for you. [whispering] Who is this? This man has a scar on the back of his right hand. He might give you... [chokes] Breathe! Professor, this is difficult, but very important. Why did White come to your room? - Did he tell you anything? - No. - No. This place might be bugged. - No. This room is clean. We checked it. And the Soviets know everything anyway - since they're the ones who did this. - How could they do this? It’s just a game. He didn't even see it coming. I'm gonna call agent Novak and we'll decide what to do next. I won't leave you for a second while you're in the game. Alright? - We're gonna have to leave in 30 minutes. - No. I'm not going anywhere! They're psychopaths. Murderers. They're going to kill all of us. That kid. He was a human being. They killed a human being. I am gonna go to the press. I'll go and tell them everything. - When they hear me... - That’s enough. I'm going to buy us some time. I'm just going to buy us some time. [Stone] We'll transport you to the embassy and we're going to say that you're not feeling well. You're safe. You're safe. Professor Mansky is under medical observation at the U.S. Embassy. [Moran] Cancelling this game will not affect the rest of the tournament. [in Russian] Andrey Savchuk, “Komsomolskie Vremia.” [in English] Are his heart tremors possibly caused by alcohol? I think we've reached a level of conversation that would dictate the end of this conference. We will see the next game as posted in the schedule. [reporters shouting questions] Christ. [sniffs] When do you plan to tell me what is really going on? Konigsberg died in the same way he did. He was poisoned. They used ricin. That’s what the Soviets use. That's not an answer. [buzzing] Three weeks ago, our surveillance discovered Soviet silos with fully operational missiles in Cuba. Do they have nuclear warheads? That's the question. [Stone] One of our analysts noticed that these hips were too small to carry nuclear warheads. But at this point, that’s just a theory. We don't know the dimension of the warheads. We don't know if they already have nukes in Cuba. But we're pretty sure they're on their way. In fact, another Soviet convoy is set to dock within a matter of hours. Surveillance photos revealed that the ships are larger - and are carrying radioactive cargo. - No. Don't please. Don't brief me. I don't want to hear about it. We can't predict what will happen if we turn back that convoy, but if the Soviets already have nukes in Cuba and want to make a strike, the East Coast will be hit in minutes. Ninety million people will die. We have less than 36 hours before they dock. Well, I'm sorry about that. [loud buzzing] John Gift. You know John Gift? No. We're here because of John Gift. That’s his code name. He is a high-ranking Soviet officer who is involved in dealings with the countries in the Warsaw Pact. Over the past year he's risked his life putting thousands of pages of documents into our hands. He was going to deliver the blueprints with the warheads to our guys in Moscow, but there was a sting. Gift almost got caught. We moved the game to Warsaw using diplomatic means, knowing Gift would be here for the Warsaw Pact conference. White was the only one to have contact with Gift. Now I understand. Someone in your operation is a rat. Gift knows this. After there was that sting. I'm the only one that Gift can be certain wasn't planted by the Russians. Correct, professor. So we need three things: ID Gift, establish contact with him, and get us the microfilm. - That’s not going to happen. - This is how it could work. We will back you up. We pass Gift coded messages to make contact during the party hosted by the Russians after the next match. He will give you the microfilm in a champagne cork. I know what you want. Gavrylov can't lose the next game. - At least, it has to be a draw. - Why? So that the Russians show up at that mixer party thing afterwards. So can you make it a draw? [beeping] [beeping continues] [in Russian] Stepan Alekseyevich, nothing will stand in our way. We have eliminated the American contact. We're closing in on our traitor. Our plan is moving flawlessly ahead. On the chessboard and beyond it. Yes... Soon, they'll be eating out of our hands on their knees. Wait! It was not to you, Stepan Alekseyevich. And thank you for the wonderful gift from Havana. I'm enjoying them. Fine. Goodbye. You were instructed not to interrupt... [In Russian] Please accept my apologies. - The Americans... - Attention! Three steps forward! Oh, so you can hear when spoken to! I've just finished this American book about post-war history. They write a lot about us. And we're always shown as goons that mindlessly follow orders or do what we're told by bloodthirsty psychopaths. [laughs] Give me your hand. America is based on one big lie. That lie is called "democracy". A rich man has the right to everything, while the worker has nothing. They treat women like servants and won't let a black man use the same shitter. They spread "democracy" to nations that give away their riches for pennies. But if those countries nationalize their mines and factories, the Americans send their armies to protect "democracy". We believe in the value of a man, while they only care about his price. We will never understand each other. So? [sniffs and gasps] What do you think I should do? We couldn't do this without you, professor. - There’s still hope. - I've heard that before. Towards the end of the war, a friend of mine from college came into my classroom. He was a physicist and needed help with a problem. I found a mistake in his calculations. I wrote a new equation and he said it made his project possible. This was Robert Oppenheimer. He said, "Why don't you come to Los Alamos. You can help. It’s our best hope. We can't do it without you." And when we saw what we did... A flash, warm breeze, everything in flames, sucked into a mushroom cloud. Hiroshima. Nagasaki. Nothing made sense anymore. Chess, Konigsberg, nothing. Hope... So you brought me here and I'm going to play chess because I know how to do it, and I'm playing my own game. That’s it, that’s all.

[exhales] That's... That's... - [Mansky] You're the guy. - Take it. [doors creaking] [slow steps] - [inhales sharply] - [exhales] It’s him. - Where is it? - I got it here. [bell ringing] I got to go. You take it. - Keep it. We have to go. - You need it. Hey! [chokes] [crack] [bell ringing] [in Polish] Ladies and gentlemen, this is the second part of today's game. [breathes heavily] [clock ticking] Judge, please. Yes? I would like to propose a draw to grand master Gavrylov. - Professor Mansky... - I understand. The situation on the chessboard is clear. Let’s not joke. [grunts] - [in Russian] No. - Please continue. [rhythmic music] Judge, please. I would like to propose a draw. Grand master Gavrylov... [applause] [host in Polish] Ladies and gentlemen, it's a draw! [Moran] Professor, - the Russians are waiting to start. - I have to go to the embassy. Didn't Miss Stone tell you? Something happened out there and we've been quarantined. We can't leave the palace until tomorrow. [Moran] They've locked us in. So... Shall we? [Moran] Thank you, I am sorry. Excuse me sir. Thank you. Excuse me. Unfortunately, professor Mansky is unable to attend the mixer. - Would you translate? - [in Russian] Unfortunately, professor Mansky is unable to attend the mixer. [in Russian] Congratulations to our wonderful players. We are happy that chess won over politics. [Krutov] Tomorrow’s game will decide the champion. Let the best man win and long live peace between our nations. [In English] In Poland, we never forget about friends. Please. It's bad. I need some assistance. [music playing] What? I need to make contact with someone outside. How can I help? Can you take me? - Now? - Yeah. I can't. I have to go back to the party with Krutov and prime minister come. Please. It’s bad. This little red book opens every door in this country. Go. If they catch you... Yeah. [splashing] [dynamic music] No-one is certain how many of them are headed for Cuba with cargoes of prohibited weapons. All that is sure is that within 24 hours a confrontation between the searching forces of the United States and the Soviet missile heading for Cuba must take place. The world awaits the outcome. - He came alone? Where’s Stone? - I don’t know. Mansky snuck on to the premises when the laundry truck arrived. Go to the boiler room. Make sure they burn every file with an orange stripe on it. - [Novak] What happened? - Stone is dead. [buzzing] This guy in a suit tracked me down and he gave me this cork. Then Stone came. She wouldn't take it. All of a sudden, they're both down on the ground. [Mansky] This guy in a Soviet uniform. I thought he was going to... I was waiting for him to kill me. He found this needle on Stone. [man in English] She prepared last vodka for you. She was going to use it on me. [buzzing] And then he gave me this. Remember. Bad one, good one. - [bell ringing] - Okay. Rakirovka. Tell them. [man] Rakirovka. [Mansky] He killed two people. I think he saved my life. I've got to figure out whether Stone was a traitor or a hero who died for God and Country. And I've got four hours to determine whether or not to tell the government to order a blockade of Cuba. White, before he died, he must have not trusted you, because he told me that Gift would have a scar on his right hand. It made me wonder about you two. I guess I was half right. She's the one who thought of Warsaw, and this plan of using me as a contact? If Stone was a traitor, the Soviets know too much. - We have to evacuate the embassy. - If she was a traitor, that means you guys are ahead of the Soviets for the first time. [phone ringing] [in Russian] Where? I'll be there in five minutes. Don't touch anything. We're ready. [buzzing getting louder] Okay. It's just like you said. One film from the cork with Stone’s blood shows that the Cubans have the nukes aimed and ready. The other says the Soviets are bluffing. Washington wants you on the line. [crackling] [buzzing] Holy shit. [clears his throat] This is President Kennedy. Stop. Stop. Do you trust the man who killed our agent, question mark. Maybe it’s a ruse, question mark. Their agent might have eliminated Gift and Stone, and given you the wrong film. Break. He reads your lips and sends the messages to Washington. You’ve seen how they reply. Just... speak clearly. [buzzing] And say "break" when you're done. There's the riddle about two brothers. One always lies, the other always tells the truth. [clicking] You meet them at a fork in the road and ask one of them how to get to town. The answer is, you ask one of them what road the other brother would suggest you take and then you take the opposite. [clicking] The algorithm is very similar. If that were the case, they would have taken the path of least resistance and eliminated me. [Mansky] They've already got everything they want. They have their traitor dead, a U.S. agent eliminated, they have ships in Cuba, and they have a chess victory. That man was Gift. [Mansky] I think he saved my life. Break. Godspeed, gentlemen. Stop. End of transmission. He’s still thinking it over. I think he’s going to make his play right before the clock runs out. Let's just hope he’s right. Wait. Where's everybody? We have orders to keep everyone in the embassy’s bomb shelter until two hours after Kennedy’s speech. - That means if we get hit... - It’ll be one of ours. Good evening, my fellow citizens. This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet Military buildup on the island of Cuba. Acting, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entire Western Hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the Constitution as endorsed by the resolution of the Congress, I have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately. First: to halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, - be turned back. - [exhales] - Congratulations. - I don’t know why. And thank you. Don't thank me. It's him. It's Gift. Whatever his name is. So, what did he mean by "rakirovka"? What did this mean? That means "castling", why? I already told you. Gift wanted you to know that. - He told you that? - Yeah. Means imminent danger. [in Russian] General Major, the leadership called. Kennedy announced a blockade of Cuba. [in Russian] Defeat is not defeat if we share it with the enemy. Get me a list of the officers of the Warsaw Pact who came to this match but were not present at the party. And have the director pay me a visit. You know, usually women flip for love or conviction, but with Stone I just can't figure it. Whatever it was, she surely was impressive. All that crying over White, thinking up that stand for Gift, and if that syringe with vodka thing had worked, you’d have found me after the party dead with all those blueprints in my pocket. We have a tail. You're sure about this? This isn't a job I like to give to a civilian. We'll have 10 seconds before they catch up. I’ll pray for you. Whatever you do, circle back for me tomorrow night. [Mansky] That'll be enough. [in Russian] Straight from Havana. I like them a lot. [in Russian] Even if you like the taste, you shouldn't inhale. [laughing] Well, I inhale. Personally, I am against violence, but our youth today is so impetuous. [chokes] - [knocking] - Come in! [coughs] [in Russian] The radio emitted this two hours ago. We were able to crack the code. You, Poles... Reaching out to the West, trying to stab us in the back. But the West betrays you and sells you out to us. Because they know we're big and strong, while you're small and weak. Plus, you're similar to us. I know everything about you. I know your sister defected to America, and that you've hidden dollars in your house, dreaming of the day you can leave our Socialist paradise. I even know that you put Mansky in a room with a secret entrance. [coughs] Tell me... something I don't know. Hospitality runs in our blood. Yes. The vodka's starting to work. That Mansky, a pal of yours. He's strange. A loner. The Americans lack morals. Maybe he doesn't only suck bottles? [chuckles] No. When we were at the bar... "The bar", you say? [applause] [in Polish] Ladies and gentlemen, in 15 minutes, we will begin the final game of the match which will be broadcast live. Tonight, we have the pleasure of welcoming some distinguished guests. Commander-in-Chief of the Warsaw Pact, Marshal Grechko, and Prime Minister, comrade Cyrankiewicz! Long live the friendship between Poland and the U.S.S.R.! [audience] Long live! You are wonderful! Professor, a word... I just wanted to say that watching you this whole match... Your play and your genius have my total respect. And listen, I've never told you this, but I was there 17 years ago. Your championship game with Konigsberg. But the reason I’m telling you this is because we see a totally different man before us now, today. [in Russian] Come out, whore. Give me your gun! [in English] Go back where you came from, rat. [in Russian] This is an illegal arrest of an American citizen who was guaranteed immunity - by First Secretary Khrushchev. - [in Russian] Shut up! [in English] From this moment, you can be afraid until the rest of your short life. I will find you. [host in Polish] Ladies and gentlemen, and everyone present here, at the Palace of Culture and Science, the pride of our great capital city. I regret to announce that the representative of the USA, Professor Mansky, has failed to appear, meaning he has forfeited the final game. Therefore, the winner of the chess tournament is Yuri Siergeyevich Gavrylov! - Bravo! - [crowd cheering] Looks like you lost another championship. [applause] [in Polish] Bravo! We will be landing in few minutes. Has anyone told his wife? She didn’t even know he was in Poland. Nobody knew. I got a lot of work ahead. [reporters] Here he comes. Mr. Mansky! Did you have a nervous breakdown? How does it feel to have humiliated the U.S. while a pilot patrolling Cuba heroically gave his life for his country? [Novak] Don’t worry about it. Leave him alone. [reporters] Was it the booze?! Do you consider yourself a patriot?! So, what happens now? In our book you're a citizen hero. You’ll be taken care of. We still do that pretty good. We'll put on a show at the UN, call it a crisis, feed the press some red meat about how those missiles were almost in the air. No one will know the difference. No one will know what really happened. Wait here, please. Oh, I almost forgot. Welcome home. - [door opens] - Hey. - You've made it. - Yes. I... live thanks to you. Not so fortunate to your friend. Fredek... he took a big risk. He was... I’ll always think of him. Always. [Gift] It was the only way out. Remember, I saw the order of attack, signed. It's a present from Novak. He wants to let us know that he's going to take care of us. It's yours if you want it. I don't want to be taken care of. The White House has announced its withdrawal from the INF Treaty due to Russia's one-sided violation of its provisions. [in Russian] President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, announced that Russia had also suspended the INF Treaty and will be taking similar steps. [theme song playing]
