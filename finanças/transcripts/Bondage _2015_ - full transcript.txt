(dramatic music) (knocking on door) (man groaning) - Oh, it hurts. - You think that hurts? - [Mistress] Well, that's better. - [Man] No, not that, Mistress. - [Woman] Always brand new bills, must be a banker. - [Terri] He doesn't like money lots of people have touched. - [Man] Mistress stop, please. I beg you. - Like that? - [Man] Yes, please. - [Mistress] Will it work? - [Man] No. - [Mistress] Do you like that? I did because it was shy. - Ow, my penis! - [Woman] Here are the keys. He is one funky monkey, honey. (dramatic music) - [Mistress] Shut up! - [Man] What am I today? - [Terri] Today? You're a man, a Chinese man. But don't bother with that Asian dialect crap. I find it demeaning. - [Man] Chinese man. Ooh, all right. And who are you? - [Terri] Me, I'm a blonde woman. (cat meowing) - [Man] I feel very vulnerable. - [Terri] Oh, you should. I picked these roles for a reason, you know. We'll call you Wong. Mark Wong. And me, I'm Tiffany Walker. I've seen you staring at me from behind the windows of your engineering laboratory, from behind those horn rimmed glasses. Why don't you just come right out and try to pick me up? You know, whisper something offensive in my ear. Or, are you not man enough? (Mark groaning) - I've been trying to approach you in my own fashion. (stammering) - What? - But you're a blonde and I'm Chinese, it's not so easy to know if it's okay for me to love you. - Oh, come on. It's 1999, for a Chinese man to love a white woman, what could be so wrong about that? - That's great, you really feel that way? Let me just declare it to your face. I love- - I'm probably not going to love you, Mark. I really appreciate you helping me study for my physics midterm. But, oh, I don't know. What can I say? I'm just, I'm not attracted to you. - 'Cause I'm Chinese? - Oh, no, oh, heavens no, I would never be prejudiced against an Oriental. But, (Mark groaning) how can we get excited about a boy who fulfills my mother's fantasies? No, no, I'm looking for a man. Someone who reminds me of my father. Someone I can regret later in life. - Ooh. (Mark groaning) So you're not attracted to me because I'm Chinese? - Oh, why are you Orientals so relentlessly logical? - You know, it doesn't hurt me that you're not in love with me. - Why not? - Because I never said I love you either. - You didn't? (laughing) - Nope, nope, nope. - That's bullshit. I heard you open yourself up to ridicule and humiliation. - I came close, I said I love, but then you cut me off. - Well, that's my prerogative. I'm the dominatrix, you're the client. - Well, maybe I was gonna say I love the smell of fresh baked apple pie in the afternoon. - That's a goddamn lie. - You cut me off mid sentence. - It does sound like something I would enjoy doing. Dammit, I'm always too eager to assert my superiority. It's an occupational hazard. God, I'm having a rotten day. - Terri. - Mistress Terri. - Mistress Terri. I really wasn't gonna say that I love the smell of apple pie. Now you can whip me for lying to you. - Well, I'm not about to take charity from my submissives, thank you. That's one good way to get laughed out of this profession. I just need a moment. Oh my God, wouldn't it be great if they had coffee makers in here? - Look, do what you want. I'm a Mexican male, you're an Indonesian, whatever. You feeling okay? - Of course I am. It just hurts a girl's confidence to stumble like that, with me in my stronger position and you in your weakest. - Why are you in such a strong position? - I was a blonde, you, an Oriental. I mean, easy target. It's the kinda roles I choose when I feel like phoning it in. Shit, now I'm giving away trade secrets. - Asian, Asian-Americans. - I have to be politically correct too? - Look, let's just pretend. Pretend that I did say I love you. You know, just to get us past this hump. - So we're gonna pretend something happened in a fantasy, even though it didn't actually happen? - What? Everything we do here is pretend. I mean, we just play out these roles until one of us gets the upper hand. - Until I get the upper hand. (exhaling) (laughing) I like power. - [Mark] So do I. - You will never win. - Try not to break down again in the middle of the fantasy. - Fuck you! - It sorta, you know, breaks the mood. - Well, I'm sorry. You know, I've had a really rotten day. I've been working very long hours. - Don't, this is a fantasy palace. So goddammit, start fantasizing. - You know, I have half a mind to take off this mask and show you who I really am. (growling) - If you do that, you know I will never ever come back here again. - Ooh, scary. What, do you imagine I might actually have real feelings for you? - I don't imagine anything but what I pay you to make me imagine. Now, would you pick up that bowl and feed me dog food? (barking and panting) - Gravy, doesn't it smell so good? (barking and whimpering) Come and get it. You little maggot. (crying) You said you loved me, Mark Wong. - Why aren't I sexy enough for you? (laughing) Maybe I'm someone completely different from what you imagined, someone with a touch of evil. Someone who doesn't study for exams. - Oh, so like you get As regardless because you're such a brainiac? - No, no, I have a terrible average in school, D minus. - What are you, a mutant? - I hang out with a very dangerous element at school. We smoke in spite of the Surgeon General's warning. What if I take you up to the lake around midnight and showed you some tricks? Do you find all this a lot more interesting? - I wasn't really planning on getting involved with someone so greasy. - No, no, not greasy, dangerous. Like, dangerous, goddammit. - Oh, wait, I am certainly not going to go out with a man from the Chinese mafia. - What, did I say anything about the Chinese mafia? - What are you gonna do now? 'Cause I've seen the movies. Rape me with your friends? - What? - 'Cause you Chinatown pipsqueaks never can't get a white woman of her own free will. And even when you do take her by force it still needs more than one of you to get the job done. Personally, I think it's just an excuse for you to feel up your buddies. - Oh, God, stop, cut. I said vaguely bad. - Yeah, corrupting the moral fiber of our nation with your evil foreign influences. - Vaguely bad does not make me a hitman for the Tong. - Well then what are you, a Viet Cong? Oh my God, that's like so much better. I really wanna sleep with you now. - No, that's even more evil. - Imprison our blonde haired, blue eyed, Iowa boys. - [Mark] No, no, no, less evil. (Mark screaming) - Neck deep in leach filled waters. - No, less evil, less evil. - Make up your goddamn mind. You know, indecision in a sadomasochist is a sign of poor mental health. - No, I'm not a Viet Cong. - Well then you're a nerd, like I said. (electricity surging) - Ow! Ow! - Would you just, it's nine volts, wimp. - No, no, I'm, I'm... - We're waiting. (electricity surging) - I'm evil, I'm evil! - Jeez, you know, dick for brains, I can't create a fantasy out of solely negative images. - No, is there something in between? I mean, someone delinquent enough to be sexy, but without also being responsible for the deaths of thousands of U.S. serviceman? - Look, this is a nice American fantasy parlor. We deal in basic mainstream images. If you want something kinky, I suggest you go to a specialty house in Beverly Hills that caters to wealthy European degenerates. Now they're weird. - Would you find me sexy if I was Bruce Lee? Yeah, what if I was Bruce Lee. - You mean like, "Hiya!" "I wuv you." (Terri laughing) Any other ideas? Or do you admit no woman ever love you, Mark Wong? - I'm defeated, I'm humiliated, I'm fried. - Well, don't complain you didn't get your money's worth. I think now, I'll mount you doggie style. You would like that, wouldn't you? - Wait, you haven't humiliated me completely. - Oh, I'd be more than happy to finish the job. Just unlace that suit. - I still never said I loved you. See, you've made a mistake before, I did you a favor, but now, I'm taking it back. - [Terri] Oh, you are really asking for it. - Ouch. - Ow, I'm not a masochist, no matter how this looks. I mean, sure, I let you beat me, treat me as less than a man. - When you're lucky. - But I still never said I love you, not without a fight. To say I love you is the ultimate humiliation. - Oh, I always pry those words from your lips sooner or later. - Not today, you won't. - Oh, look, Mark's putting up his wittle fight, oh. (cat meowing) Why is it so easy to get Mark to say he loves me? (cat meowing) Could it be perhaps, because he actually does? - Maybe you want me to be in love with you. Could that be it? - Eat me. Here, now! - You haven't beaten me down, not yet. Someday I'll reject you for loving me. And then I'll mount you doggie style. - You can't dominate me. I'm a trained professional. - Maybe I'll take up a trick or two. - I am at this six days a week, - Practicing in my spare time. - six hours a day. Yeah, with your pathetic employees in some office. They are paid to humiliate themselves before you. I am paid to humiliate you. And I still believe in the good old-fashioned American work ethic. Now, enough talking everything to death. Okay. You're a white man. And me, I'm a black woman. - African-American. - Excuse me, you trying to tell me what I should call myself? What, is this another one of our rights you're just dying to take away? - I saw you standing there, and I thought to myself, what a very intelligent woman. (laughing) - What did they do, issue you boys a friggin' handbook? - [Mark] What? - You know, for all you white devils who like to do your hunting a little off the beaten track. 'Cause you've all got the same line. You always start talking about our minds, and then, you give us this look like we're supposed to be so grateful. (upbeat drum music) Aren't you surprised, ain't I sensitive? Don't you wanna oil up your body and dance naked to James Brown? - All I said was I find you attractive. Now, if you can't deal with that, maybe you're the one who's prejudiced. - White people, every time you don't get what you want you start screaming reverse racism. - Would you be so derisive if I was a black man? - Oh, you mean African-American, stud. - Your own men, they take you for granted, don't they? I would be a little more open minded if you don't want to end up like the 40% of black women over 30 who will never ever get married in their lifetime. - Who the fuck do you think you are? You trying to intimidate me into holding up pasty white hand of yours? You trying to drive a wedge through our community? - No, I was just trying to say that they're playing basic- - You say that you were attracted to my intelligence, but I saw you checking out a lot more than my eyes. - Well, you do seem sensuous. - Oh, sensuous. Well, I can respect a man who tells the truth. - Why, that's a very tight outfit you have on. - Ooh slinky, perhaps. - And when you speak your lips. - They're round and full without the aid o' collagen. - And then, when you walk, the way you move. - Ooh, like a panther, sleek and sassy. Growling. - Through the wild. - Ooh, don't you mean jungle? - No. Wait, wait. - Because I'm so wild, right? (whip cracking) Just sun blazing, the drums beating in the distance. Just pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding, pounding. That's new to me? - No, no, you're putting words in my mouth. - No, I'm just pulling them out, you scummy liberal. What good is that handbook now? Oh, did you forget? Forget that you're only supposed to talk about my mind. - [Mark] Ow! (panting) - Forget that a liberal - [Mark] No, stop. - must never - [Mark] What are you doing? - reveal what's really going on in his mind. - No, don't cut the ropes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mistress. - On your knees, liberal. - Okay. Okay. (upbeat drum music continues) - You wanted to have a little fun, didn't you? The wild, dark woman whose passions drown out her inhibitions? Well, here's your passion. (Mark groaning) - I didn't mean to offend you. - Yeah, you just couldn't help it, could you? Suck it! Like the lily white, mothers milk fed baby boy you are. (Mark grunting) - That statistic about black women never getting married, what, did you study up for today's session? Admit it, white worm, or I'm gonna have to spank that little butt purple. - That statistic, it was just... - Just what? - Just street knowledge. - Street knowledge? Liar! - [Mark] Oh, God. - Don't you know, you will never defeat me? Look, this is your game to play all the races. Me, I've already become all races. You came to the wrong place, dick for brains. Behind this makeup live the intimate experiences of ethnic groups that have not even been born. Get up, you deserve real punishment. - Can I become Chinese again? - You know, we're not in the practice of taking requests from the customers. - I don't want you to go easy on me. Pull the chains tight. - That's the terrible problem with masochists. You never know whether being cruel is actually the ultimate kindness. (cat meowing) You want to be the lowest of the low? (Terri laughing) Then beg for it. - I desire to be the lowest of all men. - Why? - Because my existence is an embarrassment to women. - Why is that? - Because my mind is dirty. Filled with hateful thoughts against them. Threats that my weakling body can't make good on. - And is that why you desire punishment? - Yes, I desire punishment. - But you will never dominate your mistress, will you? Will you? You saw me stumble earlier tonight, you got a little thrill of exhilaration, however short lived with your 40% statistic. God, it pisses me off more than anything to see hope in a man's eyes. It's always the final step before rape. Well, it's time to nip hope in the bud. Okay, you can be your Chinese man. And me, I'll be Asian too. (dramatic music) Have you been staring at me from across the office, Mark Wong? - Who, me? - Well, I don't see anybody else in the room. - Well, I must admit- - What? - You're very attractive. - Oh, well it's good to admit these things. Don't you feel better already? - Yeah. - Because you have been staring at me from across the office, haven't you? - Well, maybe. - Oh, you don't mean maybe. - Well, my eyes can't help but notice. - You mean. ♪ Yes sir, that's my baby ♪ The only other Asian-American in this office. - It does seem like we have a lot in common. - Like what? - Like, where are your parents from? - Well, mom's from Chicago, Dad's from Stockton. - Oh. - Well, you didn't think I was gonna say Hong Kong or Hiroshima, did you? No, because that would be a stereotype. Why, are you a foreigner? - No. - Well, I didn't necessarily think so. - No, no, I was born and raised right here in Los Angeles. - Well, when you ask a question like that I'm not sure. - Queen of Angels Hospital, go Dodgers. - Hmm. Well, what else do you imagine we might have in common, homeboy? - Do you ever feel like people are pigeonholing you, or stereotyping you, or? - Well, there is a certain group of people that does categorize me, now that you mention it. - So you do understand. - Asian men. Asian men who believe that just because we shared a space in a genetic pond millions of years ago, that I'm suddenly their property as soon as I walk into a room, or an office. (dramatic music continues) Now get this straight, I'm not interested in you, okay? In fact, I'm generally not attracted to Asian men. - Don't you think that's a little prejudiced against your own people? I mean, I met this black woman a few minutes ago, she seemed to support her brothers. - Well, her brothers are probably a lot cuter than mine. Look, it's a free country, why don't you do the same? Date a Caucasian woman. - I tried that too, a couple of women back. - Well, I'll tell you why you don't, because all you Asian men are alike. You are looking for someone who's liked your mother! Someone who will smile at your lousiest jokes, and spoon rice into your bowl while you sit and grunt. (Mark groaning) - Ooh. - Well, I'm not about to date anyone that even remotely reminds me of my father. - But, how, how can I win here? - Oh, it's simple, you can't. Asian men have been oppressing their women for centuries. Now, they're paying the price by being passed over for dates in favor of dorky white men. - I mean, why should my love life suffer for crimes that I didn't even commit? I'm an American! - Oh, this is 1999, every successful Asian woman walks in on the arm of a white man. (machine whirring) - Whoa! What about Latinos or Italian men, aren't they sexist? - Personally, I would categorize them as macho. - Macho, and Asian men aren't? - No, you're just assholes. (machine whirring) - Oh, mama! Mama, okay, all right. You cannot reject me on such faulty reasoning. - Oh, I can reject you for whatever reason I want. That's what makes courtship so exciting. - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! Oh, oh God, oh! - It seems obvious now, doesn't it, how you feel about me? - [Mark] No, it doesn't. - Oh, come on, admit it. Whether blonde, black, or Asian, you, what? - I find you attractive. - Give it up! - I love you! - Oh, why young man, I had no idea. - Don't do that yet, though I had just found you attractive, I don't care about you at all. (machine whirring) Ow! Oh my God. (Mark panting) What is wrong with you? - I'm sorry, but I can never return your affections. In fact, your feelings offend me. So I have no choice but to punish you. - Okay. You win! - Say it again. - You win again. (whip cracking) - Say it again, like you mean it. - Okay, you win! - The other part. - Mistress Terri, I love you. - More believable. The last thing anyone wants is an apathetic slave. - I love you more than any woman. - Or man. - [Mark] Or any creature, or any bunny, or any part of my own body. I love you, that's how much I love you. - You're still not doing it right, dammit. - I'm like, screaming it like I usually do. I was getting a little poetic there, but, you know. - It's just not good enough. You're not good enough. How can you even talk about love when you can't approach me like a normal human being? You have to hide behind masks and these ridiculous roles. - You're patronizing me. Don't. (scoffing) Put these shackles on me. - Patronizing? No, no, no, I've been patronizing you. Today, I can't even keep up the charade. - This is totally against all the rules of the house. - Rules? Shit. Sadism is an art, not a science. So beg for more pain. Beg me to tell you about yourself. - No! (Mark scoffing) If I'm defeated, I must accept my punishment. - Get your hands off of that! Stand like a man and beg me to tell you who you are. - You've never done anything like this before. - Well, that's why I'm so good at my job. I don't allow cruelty to drift into routine. Now beg. - Mistress Terri, will you please tell me who I really am? - You wanna know really bad, don't you? - No! - Well, in the language of sadomasochism, no, almost always means yes. - No, no, no, no, no. No! You think I'm some kind of emotional weakling don't you? That I'm only here because I can't face the real world of women out there? - Well, that would be a fairly good description of all our clients. - Maybe I'm a lot more clever than you think. Have you been out there? The rules out there are set up so that we are bound to lose. - And the rules in here are so much better? - In here the rules protect me from harm. Out there my face is exposed. In here, when I'm rejected, beat down, humiliated, it's not me. I have no identifying features. I'm no longer human. That's why I'm not pathetic to come here, because, someday I am going to beat you. And on that day my skin will have become so thick that it will be impenetrable to harm. And I won't need to mask anymore to hide my face. And I will become lost in the armor. Okay, I bend to your will again, you defeated me. So strap me up, punish me. - Why all these fantasies about race? - [Mark] Please, enough! - What race are you anyway? - What if we talked about your personal life? How would you like that? - Is that what you want? - No. - Is that a no, no, or yes, no? - Yes, no, goddammit, I paid for my punishment, now give it to me. - Punishment is by definition something the victim does not appreciate. The fact that you express such a strong preference for the whip practically compels me not to use it. No, I think I would prefer to kill you with kindness. (Mark gasping) - Please, that's not what I want. - Are you certain? Perhaps I feel something for you. After all, you have made me very angry. So maybe you're a white man, I'm a white woman. There's nothing mysterious. No racial considerations whatsoever. - That's too easy. I mean, there's no reason you wouldn't love me under those circumstances. - Are you kidding? You do not have to be an ethnic minority to have a love life that sucks. - But, there's no natural barrier between us. - Oh baby, you haven't dated many white women as a white man lately. So, Mark Walker, Mark Walker, do you have a problem with interracial love? - Whatever gave you that idea? - Well, you remind me of this man I see sometimes who belongs to all races and none at all. I never met anyone like him before. - I'm a white man. Why wouldn't I have problems? This whole world is changing around me so quickly I don't even know whose country it is anymore. I can't hardly open my mouth without wondering if I'm offending someone. If I'm secretly revealing to everyone but myself some hidden hatred, some desire to strike back. Okay, let the feminists rule the place. We'll call it the United States of Amazonia, or the Chinese, or the gays, if I could just figure out who was in charge then I'd know where I stand. - You want to hear about yourself. You've been begging for it for so long, in so many ways. - How do you know that anything of what I just said was actually truthful? What makes you so sure I'm really a white man? - Well, I'm not. but after all these months, I wouldn't care to guess. So let's just say you're a man! And you're frightened, and you've been ill used in love. And you cling to the hope that power over a woman will blunt her ability to harm you while all the time you're tormented by the growing fear that your hunger will never be satisfied with the milk of cruelty. I know, I've been in your place. - You've been a man, what do you mean? - You tell me! Fight back! Tell me about me. And make me love every second of it. - All right. Yes. - Yes, who? - Yes, Mistress Terri. - Yes, who? - Yes, whoever you are, a woman who's tried hard to hate men for what they've done to her, but who can't quite convince herself. - Is that what you think? Tell me more. - You went out into the world after college, I think, I think you went to college- - It doesn't matter. - It didn't turn out the way that you planned. Rejection hung in the air all around you. Maybe you were harassed at work, maybe even raped. - Doesn't matter. Specifics never matter. - And then you found yourself here, behind the offices of "The Hollywood Star." Something, roomfuls of men begging to be punished for the way that they act out there. Wanting you to even the score, and you thought to yourself, "This is a world that I can call my own." - And so I learned what it feels like to be a man. To labor breathlessly, accumulating power. While all the while it's daunting, how tiring, what a burden, how numbing it is to actually possess. The touch of power is like cold metal. You slowly destroy yourself. Unless, one day you choose to try something completely different. - Wait, stop! What are you doing? - It's a new game, Mark. A new ethnic game, the kind you like. - We cannot play without costumes. - Oh, but this is the wildest interracial fantasy of all. It's called two hearts meeting in a bondage parlor on the outskirts of Encino with skins more alike than not. Haven't we met before? Oh, I'm certain we have. You're the one who came into my chamber wanting to play all the races. - Why are you doing this to me? I'm the customer here. - No, your time is up. - Then shouldn't I be going? - If you'd like, but I'm certain we've met before. I found it so interesting, so different, your fantasy. I've always been a good student, a diligent employee, so, I tried to understand the races I never thought of as my own. And then, what happened? - You're asking me? - Oh, come on, I'll start you off. I have a box in my closet. - In which you keep all the research you've done? For me? Every magazine article, every newspaper clipping, the weeks of transcripts of Oprah. Your eyes are drawn to the headlines. Blacks against Jews in Crown Heights. The rise of Neo Nazism in Marseille, and in Orange County. And then further, that mass murderer in Canada who said that the feminists made me do it. You became a collector of all the rejection and the rage in the world. Am I on the right track? - Is that what you've been doing? - And that box, that box is overflowing now. The clippings, they slide out from beneath the door. And you looked at it, you looked at it, maybe this morning, and you thought the box is full. And you began to stumble. And you thought that there was nothing here for you anymore. - Well, if you say it, it must be true. - Is it? - I'm prepared to turn in my uniform and start again from here. - You're quitting your job? - The masks don't work. The leather is pointless. I'm giving notice as we speak. - [Woman] Shit. - What about your hatred of men? It served you so well, are you really just gonna let all that go? - I've been a man, I've been a woman, I've been colorful and colorless, and now I'm tired of hating myself. - But, what about me? I don't think I can leave you, not after all this time. - Then stay. And strip as lovers often do. - I wonder about the coming millennium. Just seems that every label has to be rewritten. Every assumption re-examined, every association redefined. The rules that governed behavior in the old era are crumbling. And the ones of the time you have to come, and you have to be written. You are so beautiful. - Even without the metal and latex? - You look soft and warm, and gentle to the touch. - I'm about to remove my mask. (Mark wincing) - There is one thing that I never managed to achieve here. I never managed to defeat you. - You understood me. Shouldn't I be the one who's more frightened? But the customer is always right. So, come here. - Yes, Mistress Terri. - This is my final command. Take off my mask! You know you want to, admit it. - Yes, yes, I do. - The moment you remove this mask I will be completely exposed. You'll have your victory and I'll fly off over the battlefield. Congratulations, and goodbye. You disobeyed me! - I love you. - I think you're beautiful too. At a time like this, I can't help but wonder if all of this was necessary? - I was afraid, I was an Asian man. - And I was a woman of any nationality. - Why are we speaking as if those facts were somehow behind us? - We have decided to move beyond the world of fantasy, haven't we? - Tell me the truth, would you have dated me if I had come to you like this? - Well, who knows, this is the end of the millennium, anything's possible. (cat meowing) (steel clanking) (dramatic music) (dramatic music)
