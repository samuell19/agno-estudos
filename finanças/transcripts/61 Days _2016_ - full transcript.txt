Treason taints our heroic race Pain and hatred fills the hearts Our enemies are cowardly The only friend of a Turk is another Turk! Don't worry sir, I have everything under control. Yes, Mr. Undersecretary. I'll handle everything, sir. Yes, Mr. Undersecretary. Yes, our guests are here. Turkey, Turkey, my paradise! My one and only country! Who wants meatballs, gentlemen? Meatballs with parsley, the last ones... -Meatballs... -Ayran ayran! Who wants ice cold ayran, gentlemen? Meatballs with parsley! Seedless cucumbers! Have some! Seedless cucumbers! Man, what kind of fasting is this! No eating before or after... -How can you fast like that! -You can't fast like that! -For God's sake, come to your senses. -Soda... You're still moaning for soda. I'll get you a meatball sandwich and hot lentil soup. -You can have the soda afterwards. -That's right! Soda... Soda... Soda... 1970s. Gregorian: June Islamic: Jumada al-awwal Easy! Easy, you little bandits! Have you never seen soda before! -Give me one Lira! -Cibar, soda! Soda! Hang on! Wait a second! -Stop! Soda makes you clever. -Cibar! Cibar! Alright, here! Give me one Lira. Where's the money? Here... Hang on, there's enough for everybody! You're not drinking soda? -Whose son are you? -Yörük Osman's. -Who? -Yörük Osman. Yörük Osman's? What's your name? -Adem. -My late father's name was Adem too. -Here, have one on me. -No. -Your dad will pay me later. -No, dad will be mad at me! Why? I know your dad, even your grandfather. He was such an honest man. You can pay me later. Go ahead and drink it. Come on, or I'll get mad! Come on! Alright, I'll get you one! Who didn't pay? Who didn't get one? You're my first class to graduate. I feel like I'm saying goodbye to my own children. -I collected fourteen! -I got seven! Don't hesitate to visit me whenever you are in need. -What's that? -I'm a captain! You have become my children, my friends, and my family. I will never forget you. Dear students, now, a round of applause for those who made the honor roll! They deserve it, don't they? Don't be lazy during the summer holiday. Help your parents at the fields, farms and orchards. Understood? Yes! For the rest of your lives, never forget the maxim: "Independence and freedom are etched in my character!" May Atatürk's principle of revolutionism be your guide in life! -I wish you a happy holiday. -Thank you! At ease! Attention! -Please. -Listen to the cue... Fear not! For the crimson banner that proudly ripples... in this glorious dawn, shall not fade... Congratulations! That's my boy! Who else is on the honor roll? Berna. And Deniz. Here you go. You're a junior high school boy now. It's time for you to read novels... not fairy tales. -Okay. -Do you know this folk song? -No. But you're from Ula! It's an Ula folk song. What a blockhead! Mom! Dad! -Mom! -Son! I made the honor roll! Oh my darling! Congratulations. Congratulations, son! Let me see it. -Adem! -Yes, dad! -What's that I hear? -I made the honor roll! -Daddy's little boy! -My son made the honor roll! -Wonderful! Congratulations! -Osman! -Yes? -What is it? Şevket Ağa, my son made the honor roll! Let me see that. Congratulations! He'll go to college one day. Well done! Here, take this. Go on, take it. That's my boy! I hope he'll study in İzmir or Ankara, like Hasan. I hope he doesn't become a communist like Hasan! It's better if he doesn't study. The universities are have turned into dens of anarchism! Like him! Dad, what has this got to do with communism and anarchy? -Who asked you anyway? -Son, you know I can't read. What does this say? Did you pass or fail? -I failed. -Why? -The teacher failed me! Turkish, pass. Social studies, pass. Math, pass. What does pass mean? -It means I passed! -Is this all you studied for? Work in the tobacco fields all day. That'll wise you up! You son of a blockhead! School is over. Get your kids and take them to the seaside, come on! Soda pop! Cold soda. Mandarin and lemon! Soda! Orange and mandarin! Soda! Soda! Orange and mandarin! -I'll have a plain one. -Get us some too, Adem! -Okay. One soda for each of us. -Have you got money? -Yes, Şevket Ağa gave me some. -Which Şevket? Hacı Ali's relative? -Yes. -Why did he give you money? -I made the honor roll. -The honor roll? So that's why your eyes are shining. Well done! -Here. Plain, right? -Yes. And I owe you from before. That's right. I was testing you! You're honest. You're both smart and honest. Where's your dad? Over there. Wait a second. Osman! Osman! -Yes? -Look over here. -What is it, Cibar? -Come here, it's important. -What? -Let me have your son as my apprentice. -What? -Let me have your son as my apprentice. -He's such a smart boy. -Yes! He even made the honor roll. I need a boy like him. Everyone sends me their useless, dumbhead, sleazy boys! He's going to study and become a doctor, or an engineer. I don't want him to be a greedy money chaser. God forbid! Who do you think I am? I'll teach him manners. -I'm old. I can't work on my own anymore. -No, you don't get old. Here, have a sip. -I don't drink at daytime. -Go on, have some! -Not at daytime! -This is rakı, it doesn't matter! -Have some. -Shall I? -Go ahead. -Shall I? -Yes. Come on, join us. -I shouldn't. -Come on... Son, you can't turn your back to God's gifts! I'll give you a smack! Why would you sell soda? Isn't he going to become... a doctor or an engineer? -He will. My son's going to be a doctor, or an engineer. Right, dear? He says he wants to sell soda! -Greetings! -Greetings. Here, take him. He talked all night about becoming a soda vendor! I love stubborn boys. I think he takes after his grandpa! You're right, they're the same. Cibar, I entrust him to you. Treat him like he was your own son. Of course, I'll take care of him like my son. -Come in, have some tea. -I can't. The tobacco's waiting. -Listen to what your master says! Good luck! -Thanks. Take that crate and take a seat across from me. Sit over there. Adem, right? Now, you' get 25 Kuruş per bottle. And 2.5 Liras per crate. And drink all you can for free. You deserve it, as long as you work hard. But if you sell on credit even once, I'll give you a prick in the ear! -See, what does it say there? -He who sells on credit... -No, the other one. -He who sells on cash. See, the one who gets cash in advance has a big belly. The one who sells on credit is skinny and miserable! We want to be like the fat man. Okay? Drink up. Enjoying that soda? Good. That's what you'll sell. Soda, plain and flavored! Orange soda! Lemon soda! Lemon, orange, plain! -Do you need any soda? -Thanks, we just got some Coca Cola. -Do you need any soda? -Thanks, boy, we only sell Cola. We sell Cola. Say hi to your master. -Did you need any soda, sir? -Give me two crates. -What's your name? -Adem. Adem Öztürk. -You're working for Cibar, aren't you? -Yes. Say hi to your master. Tell him I'll pay soon. Say hi to your dad, too. Did you give soda to Necdet on credit? He hasn't paid anyone a penny for ten years! You gave two crates to the worst payer in Muğla! Can't you be more careful? I can't blame you, though. It's not like it's written on his forehead! If I catch him, you'll see what I'll do! Did the coffeehouse buy any? Give me that bucket. Where's the money for these empty bottles? -I drank them. -You drank them? Wow! And did it taste good? You want another one? So, you sold sodas on credit and you drank five bottles, right? Drink up the whole shop. Please! Don't hesitate, drink it all. Call your family and friends, drink until you finish everything... and I'll close the shop. Tastes great, doesn't it? Plain and orange! Is it money I'm talking about? First, sell a few bottles then drink some. You know what they say: Too much of a good thing is bad! That's it! The summer cinema has come to town! Our film tonight is Ah Müjgân Ah! Starring the great Sadri Alışık, the beautiful Esen Püsküllü... and the handsome Salih Güney! The summer cinema starts tonight. We'll sell soda before and after... and during intermission. And watch the film for free! You were going to ask my parents for my hand. Do you think they would let us marry? I would run away with you if they didn't! You still will! I'm preparing everything. I'm getting our new house in order. Even found some brand new furniture! -I'm late for work. -Won't you drink your soda? No, I feel queasy and my heart is throbbing. -Goodbye, Müjgân. -She's up to something! She didn't even drink her soda. She's going to leave Sadri... and go off to Salih Güney! You'll see. -Have you heard the rumors full of slander? -What is it? -Müjgan got engaged. -See? I told you. He came to the neighborhood. The call to prayer is 5 minutes late! Why would they put the cinema... right next to the mosque! Soda! Plain and flavored! Soda! Lemon and orange! Soda! Plain and flavored! Soda! Soda! Lemon and orange! You see? They give them a free fridge to force them to sell their soda. Never mind. No need to get upset. People don't have much money right before Ramadan anyway. But Ramadan comes with abundance. We'll sell soda in the side streets... before the evening meal. Our soda is both genuine and cheap. It aids digestion and helps you burp! Have one. Drink up. Ramadan, the Sultan of all the months, has arrived. This is the month of tenderness. This is the month of love. This is the month to cleanse ourselves of wickedness and sin. This is the month of humanity. This is the month the wealthy appreciate what it means to be poor. This is not a month in which we fast simply to lose weight. Ramadan is the month of brotherhood. Through fasting, we purify ourselves and we learn self-control. By taming our desires and exercising our free will, we become better people. We also atone for the sins we have committed throughout the year. Mastering the our instincts... is critical to being a good person. -And fasting is the best way to... -You got 2 cases of soda from my apprentice. -When will you pay for it? -Don't talk money in the mosque! -When will we talk about it? -Do you think I have money? You don't? Humankind has learned everything... from Adam. God's guidance was sent to Adam... and his progeny. -Dad, I want to fast too. -You're too young. It's not your religious duty. You can do it when you get older. Your father is right. I would say you should if it was your duty. And if we both fast, who's going to take care of the shop? God breathed life into humankind. This is what it means to be Human. What's that! What did he eat? Who farted? Who farted? You spoiled your ablutions. You can't pray. Get out! -It wasn't me. -Sure! -Don't bother, Bekir. It was the tubby one. He drinks four sodas at a time! Get out! Get out you little cub! -My blood pressure is up... -Oh my God! What did that guy eat! -It's like an atomic bomb. -God forbid. Friends! Quiet! -Good evening. -Good evening. Have some tea. -Not now, thanks. -Are you listening to me? If you really want to fast, don't eat anything until lunch. And then again fast until sunset. That's the way children fast. When you grow up, you can fast from sunrise to sunset. And this way you'll be fasting twice a day! It's twice as virtuous. Right? Your mom is right. There you are. Let's cover the windows with newspapers so nobody gets tempted in Ramadan. And whoever wants to drink inside can do it in peace. Go to the imam, then load the car. We'll go to the spot... where they fire the cannon. Okay? -Cibar! Cibar! -What! -Cibar! -What is it? -Cibar! Please help us... -What happened? -We need your help! -The imam will listen to you. -About what? The football match at night clashes with the Ramadan night prayer! -Are they at the same hour? -Yes. You're not expected to fast. Why? Because you are children. -You haven't reached puberty. -Hodja! In the name of God! What's going on? -Hodja! Hodja! -Is something wrong? -You be the judge! -Hodja, we're at your mercy. -What's happening? -The World Cup final match is tonight. -What's that got to do with me? -It's got a lot to do with you! -It clashes with night prayer! -How? They scheduled the match to the same hour. The scoundrels! What am I supposed to do? Talk to the federation? It would be great if you could, but... Quiet down, guys! Let's talk about what's possible. Could we postpone the prayer tonight? -What? Postpone what? -Could we have it after the match? Come on! No way! -Can we make up for this prayer? -Well, yes. -But not for the match, right? -No. -Don't we have until morning to pray? -I'm not going to sin because of your match! -But isn't Islam a religion of convenience? -I know that! -Isn't Islam all about tolerance? -Yes, but don't try to teach me! -Please! I'll give up alcohol! -What a liar! -I will never miss a Friday prayer! -I'll pray five times a day! I don't drink during Ramadan, and now I won't drink during the Holy Months either! -I can even quit completely! -I don't care if you drink or not! Do you expect me to change the Islamic practices for you? -Shame on you! -Please! Get lost, you rascals! -Please! -Get away from me! -Please, hodja! -I tried my best. It didn't work. -It didn't work out. Soda! Plain and flavored! Soda! Orange and lemon! Adem. Could you give me soda? Don't open it. I'm fasting. I'll have it in the evening. -Fasting? -Yes? -A children's fast? -No, a real fast. What about you? -I'm fasting too. -Well done. God bless you, girl. If you have spare bottle caps, could you give them to me? Of course. -You're done, boy? -Yes, master. Soda! -Who is the girl? -She's my classmate. Your classmate! I thought she was a relative. When she wanted bottle caps... -She's my classmate. -Not a relative? A classmate. Who knows, maybe she'll be your relative one day! -She's my classmate. -I had a classmate like that! Careful with those bottle caps. You'll have to exercise self-control. -She's my classmate. -I got it! What a nice class! They're coming! Alright, wait a moment. Be quiet! Go away! -Wait, boy. Have you paid? -Give me a soda. -It's almost time, let's chill. -Take this to Nuri. Adem! Adem, son! Are you alright? -I'm scared, master. -It's black powder. He'll be fine. That's easy for you to say! -Are you alright? -My ears hurt so bad. -It hurts so bad! -You're lucky. He'll be alright. -Thank you. You'll be fine, son. -It hurts! Don't worry, you're a lion of a boy! Good God! May God have mercy on you! I'd rather it happened to me. I'd rather die in your place. You've been put in my care as my apprentice. It's not easy to be a master. As if I can't look after a child... How would I ever look your father in the eye again? Having an apprentice is just like having your own child. If you did something immoral, who would they blame? Me. If you grow up honest and fine, who will they praise? Me. That's what it means to be a master. I'm responsible for you and your morals. If I'd had a son, I'd have named him Adem. My dad's name is Adem. A son named Adem, an apprentice named Adem. It's the same thing now. "Adem means not only flesh and blood. It means humanity, not an eye and a brow!" That's my father's favorite quote. I hope you're listening. -Fasting is the third of the five pillars... -What are you doing here at Ramadan prayer? -You're not even fasting! -Of course I am. -Do you think you're the only one fasting? -You mean a child's fast. You're just a kid. Your mouth still smells of milk. Who are you to fast? -I fasted all day today! -Good God... Our prophets Moses and Christ have also... preached the importance of fasting. Even those who worshipped nature have fasted. Even Adam fasted. Wherever there are people, there is fasting. Dad, even Mehmet is fasting. I'll fast too! -Boy, you're not the same age as him. -We're in the same class! He's failed many times! Boys his age are finishing junior high school! -And he's fat. -And Adam was the conscious one... who could use his senses and mind... -Berna is fasting too. -She's the rich Bekir's daughter. She probably sleeps until noon! Aren't you working all day, selling soda? You might pass out in the heat. Where is everyone? It's time for prayer and nobody is around. You didn't postpone the prayer, so they all went to the Müftü mosque! Did the imam of that mosque postpone the prayer? No, but he scheduled part of the daily prayer before the match, part of it for the half time break, and the Ramadan prayer for after the match! -He's doing the prayers in instalments? -We came here because we like you. We'll do part of the prayer here and the rest after the match! Okay. Okay. Cibar Kemal. You start the prayer. -You're not leading the Ramadan prayer? -I'll do it later. -Get up and lead the prayer. -Me? You had a beautiful voice when you were a boy. Yes I did when I was little but I'm getting old. Let's have Adem do it. He's my apprentice. I've taught him all I know. Allah is the Greatest! I bear witness that there is no god but Allah! I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah! Rise up for prayer! Rise up for Salvation! Allah is the Greatest! There is no god but Allah! Allah is the Greatest! Allah is the Greatest! God, forgive us... Hurry! Has it started? Out of the way! Give him a seat! Thank you. -Hodja, you've done a good deed. -You promised. You'll give up alcohol. -I don't drink during Ramadan anyway! -It's a sin, whenever you drink. Penalty! Maier is on the goal line! Second minute! Goal! -Hold it, man! Hold it properly! -Can't we cheer for a goal here! 91, 92, 93, 94, 95... 96, 97... 98, 99, 100. Hasan! Come here. Wait here at the corner. Tell me if anyone comes. Hasan, someone's coming! Come on. They went that way. They painted the walls red. Bright red! DOWN WITH FASCISM Of all the walls in town, they picked this one to paint on! Adem, what happened? You saw who did this, didn't you? Who did it? Would you recognize them? -We're asking you a question! -Muzaffer, what's going on? -Everything is fine. -Sir, we know this family. -They're harmless. -Okay. Go home everyone. It's nothing important. We'll get the walls cleaned tomorrow. What do the police want? What were you doing outside in the middle of the night? -I heard noises. -So what? Why didn't you tell me? Don't just go outside like that! What if there had been a burglar? What if they had hurt you? God help us! May God keep us safe. -I'm eating too. -Eating what? -Food. -If you're hungry, eat. Not too much, though. You'll get a stomachache. Just a few bites. God help us! I intend to fast today. For God's sake. I intend to fast today. For God's sake. I intend to fast today. For God's sake. I intend to fast today. For God's sake. I intend to fast today. For God's sake. I intend to fast today. For God's sake. I intend to fast today. For God's sake. Amen. It's going to be hot today. The radio said it will be fifty degrees. How will we work today? I heard that too. They say those who fast should stay in the shade. It's God who gives us the heat. He'll give us the strength too. -Yes, he will. -I don't understand you people. You workers are hungry all through the year, all your lives anyway. -Why do you fast? -Why shouldn't we? Aren't we Muslims? -You are, but in terms of class, you're poor. -So poor people can't pray? Fasting is a way for the rich to understand the hunger of the poor. You already understand hunger and poverty! We're thankful. There are many who are worse off than us. Even Adem wants to fast. Why shouldn't we? My little man. My little engineer! Adem, why are you fasting? You're still growing. -You're still a child. -I'm not a child! Hasan, come here. Take these papers to the accountant. -Alright. -Hasan, you went to Ankara and Germany to study... but you're still ignorant! -Why do you say that? You don't know your God and Prophet, that's why! -How do you know? -From the things you say. Our Prophet was also a revolutionary for his time! Repent! May God forgive us... What he did in the corrupt Arabian Peninsula was revolutionary. He said: "He who sleeps full while his neighbor is hungry is not one of us." Hasan, hurry! You talk to the workers all day! Alright. Adem, come over here. Well, he seems to have abandoned religion. God forgive him... He says such strange things. I don't understand what he's saying. His words and actions are strange. -Do they teach that stuff at the university? -He never really attended to his classes! He's involved in anarchy. He even went to jail. Şevket Ağa saved him. They were going to kill him. His mother fell ill when she heard it all. She was hospitalized. His dad brought him home. He's working in the tobacco fields now... until he wises up! That's my little lion! You've survived your first protest! -What page are you at in the novel? -I haven't started yet. You'll never finish it like that. You're good in practice... but you also need some theory! Consciousness is important. You lack class consciousness. That makes you no different than an animal. -Do you hear that? -Yes. Just look at the oxen. Do they say "We work too much! We want the weekends off! We want more hay"? -They don't. -Do they say "Let's get organized... and form a labor union, a cooperative, we will not work without insurance"? -They don't say that either. -Look at the donkeys. Carrying load back and forth. They've been exploited... and belittled for centuries. Do any of them rise up? They don't. Hasan, what are you going to do with my donkey? We're not doing anything to the donkey. I'm teaching the kid class consciousness! Using my donkey? They even get sexually exploited by humans. -Do any of them protest? -They kick the humans! That doesn't count! That's instinctive and individual protest. It's unconscious. Without class consciousness and collective awareness... you're no different than a donkey. You'll be exploited all your life... like any beast of burden. But if you must read fairy tales... at least read the people's storytellers. -Okay. Read Aesop. He's our compatriot. He's nothing like La Fontaine. La Fontaine is a thief. All that rubbish about the hard-working ant... and the lazy grasshopper! And he has no respect for art! Get lost! Are you going to bite me? -Good morning, Cibar. -Good morning. -How's it going? -Fine. Send us a few cases of soda daily. It will cool off the workers. Really? Adem will bring it in the afternoon. -Have a good day. -Say hi to your dad. See what an education does? He appreciates real soda! Take this. Put it in the cart. Şükriye prepared it. It's a Ramadan bag. In the name of Allah... -People can fast. Can animals fast? -They can't! Why? Because they lack intelligence, they lack comprehension. -They also lack class consciousness! -What's class consciousness? -They don't have the weekends off. -Even I don't have the weekends off. Why would a donkey? God, forgive me... Anyway, fasting isn't merely going hungry and thirsty. For example, you avoid verbal misconduct. What does "verbal misconduct" mean? -What does it mean? -You don't lie. You don't curse. If a man fasts, but every chance he gets... he curses, is that any way to fast? -No! -No. And then, no "adultery of the eye" either. What does "adultery of the eye" mean? -What does it mean? -You don't look at someone's wife... or daughter with impure intentions. Yes, son? -Can we swim in the sea? -The sea... It's risky. Why? Say you plug your nose and mouth, well, pardon me... but then the water could go up your rear end! -You never know. You can't guarantee. -Does eating chocolate break the fast? -It does. -Biscuits? -Yes. -Watermelon? Anything you eat breaks your fast. All that doesn't is a good beating! So now, say you set out to fast... but you forgot and ate something. Or you fainted, and someone gives you something to drink. Is the fast broken? No. But if you knowingly and willingly... eat or drink, then the fast is broken. Because then you have... succumbed to your desires, right? You couldn't exercise self-control... and broke your fast. What is the penance? The penance for that is 61 days of extra fasting! 61 days! 61 days! Since you can't control your will, you must suffer the punishment. 61 days! 61 days! You succumbed. You must atone! You succumbed. 61 days! Oh, my boy is here, my sweetheart... -What's that in your hand? -A Ramadan gift bag from my master. God bless him. Be sure to always obey your master. -I will. -What's this, you're a bit sweaty. Look how sweet my boy is, just look at him. Look, everyone! My son will be a doctor. My son will be an engineer. When the girls of Ula see my son... they'll pee their pants! -Mom, what are you doing! Stop! -Adem, give some soda to whoever wants it. -Okay. -Come on. -Gülşen, get started. Tobacco I did sow. But it did not grow. The others have a beau. But I have only woe. In gardens, she will tarry. While I serve my country. And when home I do hurry. She and I will marry. -Thanks, I'm fasting. -Me neither, I'm fasting too. -You, sister? -I'm fasting too, dear. I'm not fasting, but I shouldn't drink in front of them. Never mind Adem. You'll drink them at the evening meal. -Take those two bottles to dad. -Okay. -Come on, off you go. -Where did these sodas come from? -Hasan got it for everyone. Hasan got it? Doesn't he know we're fasting, that anarchist devil? Take that back! Don't talk like that about my son! My God! Buying soda, with whose money? Like he earned the money himself! He treated his mother and father to soda. What's wrong with that? You spoil him. How many times have I told you not to give him money! It was only 20 Liras. Should my boy starve to death? Let him starve, the damned anarchist! All day he buys the workers... soda and ice cream. Does he think money grows on trees? My boy has a pure heart. That's why he's generous. Of course he'll take care of the workers. Is it easy being the son of the Ağa? He can buy people things with his own money. As if all he did in Ankara wasn't enough... now he's back to interfere with my workers! So talk to your father and get him to start this union or whatever! Do you really think he's gonna start a union for you? -Why wouldn't he? Sit over here, Adem. -My father is your class enemy! Why would he be my enemy? Şevket Ağa takes care of everything. He married me and had my son circumcised. Doesn't the man give us money whenever we go broke in winter? -He does. -Does he do it for free? He needs your labor, he depends on you. He has to look after you... so he can put you to work, exploit you! -Exploit us? Bite your tongue! -Does he not pay our wages? -He does. -But he makes twice as much as you make. -Well, the field is his! Did he buy it with the money he earned? He inherited it from his grandfather. It was left over to him from Ottoman times! Just because the field is his, does that mean he gets to exploit your labor? Look, don't get us into the dispute between you and your dad. If we're going to have a union or whatever, then let him establish it for us. After the revolution, the exploitation of tobacco workers will come to an end. -How's that going to happen? -The deeds to our fields... will be made in your name and divided off. The land will belong to... whoever works it, whoever waters it! -Like prime minister Ecevit said? Ecevit is a reformist. We are revolutionaries! -Who and what are you revolting against? -They're revolting themselves! Hasan! Get the rope from the attic. We're going to hang the tobacco tonight. -I've got work to do downtown. -What have you got to do downtown? -It's not like you're not running a shop! -Mom's darling! Eat this up quick. -I ate at the shop. -What did you eat? -Peppers with yogurt, black eyed peas... -No sins of the tongue! You mustn't lie! Well eat a little bit here too, come on. -Just a couple of bites. -Mom, I won't eat! Then don't, you damn stubborn boy! I won't waste my time on you. Take this to your master and say your mom sent it. Okay? -Okay. -And give him our best. You can eat this when you get hungry. But make sure to eat it, okay? We have a village. Full of places to live. I hoed a field of tobacco. And my heart I did give. No sins of the tongue! You mustn't lie! 61 days! There you are, my boy. Nobody comes to the shop in Ramadan. Let's load up so we can sell in the back streets, okay? You think it's easy being a tradesman? It's not easy, is it? Now, you're going to sell these to your friends in the streets. Kids don't fast, but don't let them know it's me. They shouldn't say "What's a grown up man doing... selling soda at Ramadan?" Now shout out "Soda, soda!" Okay? Soda! Soda! Stop yelling! Why are you yelling? You'll wake everyone up. Aren't you ashamed, selling soda in this heat? No money for you! How am I supposed to buy this soda? Now get out of here! Everyone is fasting and they need sleep! Don't come to this neighborhood again! Who's sending you here? You sinful little boy! -Whose apprentice are you calling sinful? -I'm telling him! -Do you hear what you're saying? -I hear it well. Very well, actually! I'm the breadwinner of my house! Ramadan or not, I have to make a living! Why should I care? Get lost! Shameless man! Aren't you ashamed of arousing people's appetite in Ramadan? I'm not ashamed! Where am I supposed to sell my soda in Ramadan? Sell it somewhere else! Stop arousing people! You godless devil, go sell it to your mother! Get lost! It's clear you were aroused before I got involved anyway. -What are you saying, you pervert? -Run! -You are out in the streets half naked! -Screw you and your soda, you motherfucker. -I've had enough of you! -Stop shouting! You greedy bastard! Good grief. -Stop yelling! Go back inside. -Your head's bleeding! -Oh no. -Are you two still out there? -I left my slipper there! You're fasting for yourself. Wrinkled, ugly woman! I know her well... Back in the day, everyone in Muğla had a go at her. Now her sins are stacking up, and she's making a show of being a Muslim! I was about to do her too but... God forgive me. She's lucky she's a woman. If she were a man, I'd have busted her nose. If she ripped her clothes, went to the police and said "He groped me!" As if I would want to grope her... What can you say then? Arousing her appetite... I would have known how to arouse your appetite but... She's lucky it's Ramadan! I'd have given her a piece of my mind. It's over there. Run! -Master, I don't want to get it! -She's not going to kill you! -Go get it, I'm right behind you! -Couldn't we get it a little later? You think they would leave it there? Thank God nobody's taken it yet. -Go, run! -Master, don't make me do it. Son, you have to be safe first, but you must guard your possessions too! You don't have a clue about how the world works. Do you think I care about a slipper? How much does a slipper cost? Tell me, how much does a slipper cost? Do you think I'm after a slipper? But say she takes my shoe and tosses it into her bedroom, goes to the police and says "He groped me." That would be the end of me. I'm a tradesman. I'm the son of Cibar Adem. Once she slanders me, I'm done for. What can I say then? You're just a boy. Do you think she can slander you? No. If she slanders me, who else does she slander? -Who? -Whose master am I? Mine. Well, think about it. She slanders you too. Now go, run! I see. Run! Run and take the handkerchief too. Run! Put it here, left, left! Run! Do you think I'm after a slipper? -Good day, Cibar. -Thanks, Hasan. Adem, get us some soda, come on now. What happened to your forehead Cibar? Get well soon. -It's nothing. A bottle cap hit me. -Get well soon. Now friends, like Gorky says: "Man is an honorable word." The poet says: "Man is the noblest of all creatures," said my father. I treasured those words, but I grasped... their true meaning one September day... when I cut my wrists." Come on friends, let's drink our sodas inside. Friends, Adem is now one of our comrades. He didn't give a statement to the police last night. -He committed his first revolutionary act! -Well done! -So you're a revolutionary, right? -Yes. -What does it mean to be a revolutionary? -It's one of Atatürk's principles. -No soda for us, Adem? -Go get three more, Adem. -And get one for yourself. -I won't have one. -No way, have one on me. -I won't drink it. -Are you fasting or what? -Adem, what's going on my boy? Three more, master! One should drink local soda to support the national bourgeoisie. -The soda of our own land! -What do you mean? Capital can't be "national". Exploitation is exploitation! Say we buy this soda and it contributes to the national capital. But well, isn't Adem being exploited? Isn't Cibar Kemal exploiting him... and making surplus value off him? -That's true. Are you insured? Adem, are you in a union? -I'm on the honor roll! -Well done, Adem! What's all this about unions and insurance? Adem's like my son. You should be ashamed of yourselves, giving a kid those anarchist ideas! -Calm down, Cibar! -You destroyed the People's Party. What more do you want? Gather up those bottles, son. Shame on you all! -Don't get mad, we didn't say anything bad. -Even Ecevit and the ruling party... haven't been able to fix the country. And you think you can? We're just kidding around. Come on, have a tea on us. -Have a seat. -You go drink your tea in Russia! For God's sake... Cibar... Don't listen to those anarchist devils. Who needs extremism when we've got the People's Party? -God created the Earth... -Adem finish that novel right away. I'm going to quiz you on it, you've been warned. Don't quiz him. He's my apprentice. I'll be the one to teach him. God created the Earth. Atatürk saved the homeland. That's all you need to know! God forgive us... Too much of a good thing is bad. There's no need for extremism. In life, you should neither march up front, nor fall behind. It's like that in the military too, if you walk front row... they make you do all the work, and if you fall behind you get a kick in the ass. That's it. Too much of a good thing is bad! Come drink your water. In my hand a glass of holy light, from the cupbearer in Kevser Lake. In the words of Shah Hasan-Hüseyin and the lineage of Muhammed... Hurry up! -Did you do a child's fast yesterday? -Yes. I could tell. You looked pensive. You didn't even notice the cannon go off. You will not fast, not even for a second! You're a child. It'll hinder our work. If I see you fasting for even a minute I'll prick your ear. You can fast when you grow up. You saw who wrote these, right? Who were they? Adem is now one of our comrades. He didn't give a statement to the police last night. Come on! Get going. Look, tourists. Let's set up the stand way over there in the shade. Let's get a bucket each and corner the tourists from both sides. And over here the soda can't be 125 Kuruş. You have to sell it to them... for at least 2.5 lira. Okay? -Okay. And if they say it's expensive, you say "Do you think it's easy to bring soda... all the way here in this heat?" You cool off by swimming the sea... I cool off by making money!" If a guy gives you a 10 Lira bill... and wants three sodas. Don't give him the change right away. Dig around for a while like you don't have any on you. Say "Can I give you another soda instead?" You got that? You've got to be smart as a fox. Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. Keep shouting: "Soda! Soda!" Tempt people, whet their appetites. Now off you go. Go ahead my little lion, go get them! Soda! Soda! -It's the soda boy! -Run, run! Go get some soda for the kids. -You want one? -No. -Can you give me 2 sodas? -Seda, send that boy over for tea. Go have some tea. Have a break. My boy! Come here for a cup of tea. -It gives me a stomachache. -Tea doesn't hurt the stomach! Come on over. Pour the boy some tea. -God help me! -Let's have some tea together. Come on, boy. Come here. Have some tea. Have a cup of tea. Come here, boy. -God give me patience! -Come, have a cup of tea. Stubborn boy, come on. Soda! Soda! Can you give me an orange soda? Mom, the money! Soda... Soda... Give me two plain sodas there sweetheart. You will not commit adultery of the eye. You will not look upon what is forbidden. Wow, wow! Hey, son. Come over here and let me feed you. Look, there's a barbecue going, let me cut up some meat for you. We have peppers with yogurt and black eyed peas. -Come on, make him a sandwich. -Mom, are you crazy? Will you force some boy you don't know to eat? He should eat something. It's a good deed on a day in Ramadan. -My boy! -Maybe he's fasting. How do you know? -Are you going to force him? -A little boy shouldn't be fasting. Come here, boy. Eat a little something. Come on! -What do you want, madam, what! -Whose son are you? -Tobacco farmer Yörük Osman's. -The blond Osman! -Are you Gülizar's son? -Yes. Come here, boy, we're kin! Come, let me feed you some bread. Hey boy! -Come have some bread! -I've eaten already. -You're a child, you can eat again. -I'm not a child! What are you then, a man? Come on boy, come. My boy, come eat something. Soda! Soda! -Soda boy! How much is your soda? -2,5 Liras. Give me four. You will not commit adultery of the eye. Soda! Wow! You don't look at someone's wife or daughter with impure intentions. Hey, Gülizar's son! Come boy, eat some watermelon. Look I sliced a watermelon, let's make a boat out of its rind! -Mom, leave the kid alone. -I'm going to feed him. He won't have tea or bread. He won't have grilled meat. What do you eat then, boy? You monkey! Give me that! I'm dying of fasting in the heat. What good is a picnic? Why don't you stay at the house you big bucket! Hey, son of a monkey! Eat! Bite it! Who did you take after, you stubborn one? You're eating that! -I won't eat! -Eat it! What is she doing to the kid? Is she crazy or what? -I won't eat! -Eat! Eat! -Let me go! -Mom, what are you doing to the kid! -What are you doing on top of the boy? -Eat! Eat! How can you force someone to eat watermelon? I don't believe you... Damn boy! He didn't eat a thing all afternoon! -Let go of me! -You've got blood pressure, diabetes. -You've got everything. Eat it yourself! -I haven't broken fast since I was a girl. The sea is risky. Say you plug your nose and mouth, well, pardon me... but then the water could go up your rear end! May God forbid! What are you doing, girl? Are you burning up inside? God forgive me! God forgive me! -They're burning up! -Soda! Go on, let's get out of here! It's not worth losing my faith over selling a few bottles of soda. Let's get out of here for God's sake. Go go go! What is this? You've stripped naked like a newborn calf! Are you burning up inside, dear? Why get so naked? If you feel hot, I suggest you drink some soda but... For God's sake... Never mind. -Mestan! -Yes! -Where are you going? -We're going downtown. -Drop me off at the shop, would you? -Sure! Jump in the back. It won't get up the hill with both of us. Okay. Go slow. I should get to the shop to make some more soda. Come on now. Keep going. Hey, hey... You donkey! What are you gonna do, get on top of me? Move over. Take your time! You're bothered? Move over! A true wrestler is one who can tame his desires. You set out to fast. Now you keep going to the fountain every chance you get! If you would only be a little bit patient, your sustenance would come running to you. It would give you immortality and take something eternal from you. Be a little patient. And as for that La Fontaine you've got in your hand. Don't read anything by that scoundrel! He's good for nothing. Giving us a bad name when we are innocent! He gave us a bad name too! He made us into beggars. We earn our bread with our craft! He puts the blame for humankind's mischief and malice completely on us! Supposedly, he came to me in winter and asked for barley... and I chased him away. Really! What a bunch of lies! What a shame! Would I ever do that to a guest who has come to my door? What a lie! I only live for a couple of months anyway! I haven't even seen a winter in my life! And who says being a musician is being lazy? If my friend didn't sing and play, I wouldn't be able to work in this heat! His songs give me strength and I give him barley. That's how it is. What is it you're blaming us for? Right? -Here, take this barley. Make it last. -Thanks, Sezai. Thanks. And you, if you're going to fast, fast. If not, don't. Don't keep bugging people. -Where are you going? -I'm going to Mecca. -To Mecca? -Yes. But didn't you just say... you only have a couple of months to live? -So what? How can you get to Mecca with such little time? Who says I'll get there? What matters is not arriving at a destination... but setting out on a journey. Even if I don't make it, I'll die trying. You understand? Anyway, take care. -Young man! -Yes? -What's that you're selling? -Soda. -How much is a bottle? -2.5 Liras. Give me three. -Are you from around here? -Yes. A friend of ours is from here, Hasan Keskin. -Who? -Hasan Keskin. He studies at METO. We're his friends from Ankara. -We came to pay him a visit. -Ah, Hasan. He was downtown today, at the community center. -Where can we find this community center? -Go downtown, everyone knows it. Here. Keep the change. I've got diabetes, I've got blood pressure. I get dizzy. You think it's easy to fast in this heat? It's fine in winter. The weather is cool and the days are short. I'm afraid I'll crack in this heat. It's all because of this damn thing. I can go without food and water for three days. But this poison... Promise me you won't start smoking. I won't forgive you if you do. Is there anything worse? It's worse than rakı. You only drink rakı if you have money! But this is different. You'd beg even your enemies for a smoke. There's a saying: "The hand takes your money, the wind takes your smoke... but the poison stays with you." Now do you understand? God forbid. Thankfully I didn't intend to fast. As if the tourists on that beach would let a man fast! God forbid, I would have had to repent for an extra 61 days. God forbid. Good thing I'm not fasting. Come on over, splash some water on your face. Have a soda and rest. Okay my boy? Put 3 more cases of soda in the cart... and go to where they blast the canon. Okay? The kids must be awake, sell these in the backstreets. Alright? -What's the matter? Are you sick? -No. Look, son, I know you're tired, but we work at Ramadan, we earn money. After Ramadan, we're going to rest easy. We have to scrape for a living. After that, I'll take you to the beach every day. Maybe we'll even go to the İzmir Fair in the holidays. There's so much going on there. Artists, guns, funny mirrors... You stand in front of them and they make you look all strange. I'll even take you to an Emel Sayın concert! What more can I do? Good God... Soda! Soda! Adem, give me a bottle. -Open it. -Open it? -Yes. -Weren't you fasting? No. I only fast the first day, the last day, and the Night of Measures. What about the cap? Ah, are they all mine? Thank you. -Who are you to talking to out there? -Am I not allowed to talk to my friends? -Isn't that Adem from your class? -Yes. Look what he gave me as a gift. -Oh, so you became a soda vendor? -Yes. I work in the summer. -Good for you. Your family's well? -They're fine. -They're in the tobacco field. -Of course... Poverty is a tough thing. Well done for helping out. Say hi to your mom for me. Girl, you come inside. You're a young woman now. You can't just go out on the street! What are you gonna do with that junk? Adem, you forgot to take the money. It's fine. Fasting is not your religious duty. -You think it's easy fasting in this heat? -It's God who gives us the heat. -He'll give us the strength too. -I fasted all day today. Why would a little boy fast in this heat? Who are you to fast? It takes guts to do that! Why are you fasting, son? You're still a child. Humans can fast, but animals can't. Because they lack intelligence, they lack comprehension. Psst, hey. Enough already, Adem! Pay no mind to the ant. All the ant knows is work, work, work! You're human! Life is also about having fun, getting around, enjoying your time! You've already proved your willpower. Do you think God hasn't seen that? In this day and age, how many kids can resist hunger and thirst like you have? Enough already. Get up. Drink your water, drink your soda. Drink up! Two sodas for us! 61 days! 61 days! 61 days! Since you can't control your will, you must suffer the punishment. 61 days! You succumbed. You must atone! You succumbed. 61 days! Where are you Adem? -Nuri, have you seen my apprentice? -He was here a minute ago. -Let's go and eat, dear. -May God see your good deed. -Come, lets break our fast. -I already have. -Come. -I already have. Adem! Young man. We couldn't find Hasan Keskin at the marketplace. They said he was in the field. Do you know where that is? Can you take us there? Come on, it's urgent! Get us there before it gets dark. "There, love and children don't mix. Life is made up of four things, as my father would say... Water, fire, earth and wind. Man is the noblest of creatures." Hasan! Hasan! -Yes? -Your friends from Ankara are here. -What? -Your friends from Ankara are here. -What friends? -Visitors. -Whose friends? -Yours. Where have you been? I've been so worried. Hasan! Hasan! Hasan! Soda... Have you got any cold soda, Adem? Hasan! Hasan! Cold soda... Hasan! Hasan! Hasan! Hasan! Hasan... Hasan... 61 days... 61 days... 61 days... -Soda... Hasan, soda... -We give him hot soup. -All he says is "soda, soda." -Adem, my boy, give up this hunger strike. -You won't achieve anything. -Careful! -Quick, prepare the vein! -Yes, sir! We'll put him on an IV drip. We have to intervene. Today, Adem Öztürk and three other unnamed activists... who have been on indefinite hunger strike, have entered a coma on day 61 of strike. The activists, who demand an end to torture in prisons, the right for correspondence, access to books, the right to a clear view and the status of political prisoners, have been on a hunger strike for weeks now... in various prisons around Turkey. At this time, a delegation made up of human rights advocates, relatives, intellectuals, and artists are holding negotiations with the authorities of the Ministry of Justice about putting an end to the strikes. I'm announcing it now, sir. Congratulations. An agreement has been reached. I don't want treatment. Get it away! -We have to give you an IV. -Stop it! -An agreement has been reached. -Doctor, intervene immediately! Don't worry, we will. We have received news from Ankara that the prisoners' relatives, along with Human rights activists, have reached a compromise... with the authorities of the Ministry of Justice on various clauses... putting an end to the hunger strike on the 61st day. Oh God... Oh God... If you really want to fast, don't eat anything until lunch. And then again fast until sunset. That's the way children fast. When you grow up, you can fast from sunrise to sunset. My child... My child... Adem is immortal! Adem is immortal! Adem is immortal! Adem is immortal! My brothers! We have lost our brother Adem in the Holy month of Ramadan! Do you give him your blessings as we send him on to the afterlife? -Bless him! -Do you give him your blessings? -Bless him! -Do you give him your blessings? -Bless him! -Lillehil Fatiha! He was going to be a doctor. My one and only... My blond child... My beautiful eyed son... He was going to be an engineer! Adem! My son! My doctor child! Let me go! Adem! Adem! My engineer... My doctor...
