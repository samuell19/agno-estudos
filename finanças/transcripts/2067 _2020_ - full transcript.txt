GRID: Emergency reroute required. 90 seconds until nuclear core overload. You down the hall tonight? Why? You going to grace us with your presence? JUDE: Fill up both. See if she'll hold. GRID: Danger. Evacuate utility tunnel. Yeah. She'll hold. And hell no, I'm not going. JUDE: Oh, come on, man. There'll be booze and small talk. Not for all the oxygen in the world. Hey. [LAUGHS] Hanging around a bunch of lowlife foggers. Lowlife foggers have feelings too. Alright. Light it up. [ALARM BLARING] GRID: 30 seconds until overload. Evacuation incomplete. Utility tunnel locking down. Sealed. Depressurization imminent. You know, you might even find yourself a wife there one of these nights. JUDE: Another mouth to feed, great plan. How the hell am I going to have time for a wife when I'm stuck down here wiping your ass every day? - Right here. - GRID: ...5, 4, 3, 2, 1. ETHAN: Light it up, baby. Ah! GRID: Power reroute complete. System stabilized. Workers, form an orderly line. A reminder that oxygen credits are not transferable. ChroniCorp... Breathe easy. Uh, I can't, uh, do my shift tomorrow, but it's not a problem. Uh... - I'll take it. - I can make it up. No. It's not my fault you don't want to get paid. - I'll take his shift. - We're ahead, boss. Fine. You're in. He's out. Permanently. MAN: What? No, no. Hey, hey. - ETHAN: You good? - JUDE: Yeah, man. It's more money in the pocket. GRID: O2 is currently at 3.3%. ETHAN: Come on. Let's go. Where the hell is he? MAN: Hey, man. JUDE: Georgie, I need the money tomorrow. He owes me money for that. Hey, Jerry. How you doing? There's no fire without oxygen. There's no fire without oxygen. Yeah. You got any smart ideas? - Get out of here. - There's no fire without oxygen. - Get out of here. - Hey. - Why don't you just leave it? - No. You listen to me. - There's no fire without oxygen. - It's always something. ...for generations to come. Hey. No, listen. We have to sacrifice it all for the generations to... [COUGHS] Oxygen is not a privilege. You're not listening, and I will make you listen. - Okay. Alright. - I need my job. - Get off me. - My kids got the sickness too. - I will make you listen. - What do you want me to do? - We all need to... - Listen to me. You know that oxygen is not a privilege. [SCREAMING] REPORTER: Another suicide protest today marked the anniversary of the death of the last living plant in captivity. Since the believed extinction of plant life, deaths have continued to spiral out of control due to biophysical rejections of the synthetic oxygen that humanity has come to rely on. As the leading distributor of synthetic O2, ChroniCorp is still committed to finding a solution to this oxygen crisis that the world has termed The Sickness. However, citizens continue to revolt amid fears that this may be the end for humankind. ChroniCorp's quantum physicist Dr. Richard Whyte once radically posed that in the unlikely event that humanity survives this crisis, could we somehow find a solution from our descendants in the future? Some suggest that his death some 20 years ago is linked to... [SIGHS] - Oh, my... - Hi. Hi. Did I just hear your dad's name? I got something for you. Oh? - Close your eyes. - Okay. - Are they closed? - Yes. - Alright. Keep them closed. - Mm-hmm. Keep them closed. Okay. Okay. Open. What did you do this time? See, um, the strap is loose on the other one, and I... I... I still have to seal it, and, well, this one is compatible with the high-grade O2. I don't need that. Okay. It's fine. I-I-I got a new shift. [LAUGHS] But this is fashion. It looks great. Yeah, it does. Really? Oh. What? Don't you want to look pretty too? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Don't... Don't start this again. Remember what they said. - You need to calm down. - Okay. You need... you... you... you need to relax. - [COUGHS] - Shit. Are you okay? - Sorry. - J-Just give it to me. It's fine. - ETHAN: Please. - It's fine. Shit. [SIGHS] [WHIRRING] MAN: Citizen number 34465? [DEVICE WHIRS] We've been instructed to bring you upstairs. JUDE: We've got clearance to be down here. He doesn't like to be touched. He'll go if I go. Let's just see what they've got to say. Come on. GRID: Greetings, citizen. Welcome to the Applied Sciences Division of ChroniCorp. ChroniCorp is proud to be the largest supplier of breathable air to the people of the world. ChroniCorp... Breathe easy. Greetings, citizen. Welcome to the Applied Sciences Division of ChroniCorp. ChroniCorp is proud to be the largest supplier of breathable air to the people of the world. REGINA: Even the fires burn themselves out. They can't breathe, either. My name is Regina Jackson. I'm the CTO of Particle Research. And you're Ethan Whyte. Um, yes, ma'am. How's your wife? Our records show... I'm looking after her. We've all accepted that things today are even worse than what scientists predicted. The fact is the O2 rejection epidemic is going to wipe out the human race within a handful of years. I appreciate you bringing us up here, but... but what exactly are you offering? What if I told you that you could save all of us? I-I'd hate to seem like I don't appreciate this show-and-tell, but I think we should go. REGINA: Your security has been upgraded. You'll be briefed at the lab. Welcome to our Hail Mary. Meet the Chronicle. [MACHINE WHIRS] Billy Mitchell. An absolute honor to meet you, Ethan. So you're the one. Interesting. Ethan, do you know what your father did here? BILLY: Alright. 3 minutes, 10 seconds. Calibration is within tolerance. REGINA: It's taken us 20 years. If only your father could see this. My father's not here, is he? Right. Of course. I'm sorry. During our first trial, we tested the Chronicle with something that wouldn't take as much power as matter... radio waves to act like a sort of ping to see what was on the other side. The radio waves bounced back, but they had been changed. There was something encoded inside. Bounced back, what? What do you mean, bounced back? From where? Not where, when. We received a message from the future. From the future? This is a fucking time machine? 407 years into the future. 400 years? You're telling me people are still alive then? The message was simple, Ethan. Red, decode Chronicle file 170681. Up here. [WHIRRING] REGINA: The people who sent the message must have found a cure for the O2 sickness. It's impossible. There's no other way they could still be alive that far in the future. We think they want to give the cure to us so that we could save more people here. Why ask for me? We don't exactly know why, but we may only get one shot at sending someone. One shot? The Chronicle feeds off the nuclear reactor under the city. Just to fire a clock a few minutes through time knocks large sections of the city off the grid. To fire the mass of a human that far? Let's just say I hope we don't have to try this twice. Why do I get the feeling that there's a catch? Ethan, we don't know yet how to bring you back. You want to shoot me into oblivion with... with no way to get home? REGINA: You have to find the people who sent the message. They can help you get back. You have got to find the cure. You may be humanity's only chance. You may be your wife's only chance. MAN: Beautiful, crisp, clean air, all you can breathe, only $20 an hour. JUDE: Have you ever seen anything like that shit before? - Two more. - It's all very impressive. I'm not leaving Xanthe as a favor to those ghouls. Use it. He's buying. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] ETHAN: Ah. Alright. Alright. JUDE: What's the matter with you? ETHAN: What? Do you... do you really believe I'm going to save the world? Very romantic. You need to take this seriously. Your old man believed them. My old man was a fool and a liar. What if there's more to his story, Ethan? Story? You want to hear more? A father leaves a suicide note for his 8-year-old son. If he'd just been there instead of chasing fucking rainbows, my mother would still be alive. Very heroic, and as if this wasn't enough of a reminder of that, you want me to do what? Follow in his footsteps to leave my sick wife to die? I remember when I brought you down in the tunnels for the first time. You were so scared of just being left alone. Remember what I told you? "Without the darkness, there's no light." Stupid saying. Fuck you. Listen, shithead. I've been through hell and back in this life. I've lost my family, damn near lost my mind. I've been working in those fucking tunnels for as long as I can remember, and the only thing I know that works is when we fight for ourselves, protect what's ours. I can protect Xanthe. I'm not just going to abandon her. And what are you going to do when she gets worse? This ain't about saving the world, bro. You want to prove that you're not like him? Save her. [DOOR OPENS] He's been waiting for you all day. RICHARD: I made this for you, Ethy, because I have it on good authority that you are going to grow up to be someone very important. A science man? A science man. Now, this is going to hurt a little, but it will help you become who you are meant to be. Now, one day you'll understand. You will want to trust what you can see with your own eyes, but it won't be enough, and you will need to make a choice about whether you believe in something bigger. Believe in what? Believe in people. [WHIRS] [GASPS] [BREATHING SHAKILY] I'm sorry, Ethy. You're done. It won't come off. SELENE: What's wrong with you? ETHAN: Papa... SELENE: Don't you dare leave us again. When? I'm not leaving you to chase some stupid fantasy. You think a second chance is a fantasy? How could you say that? Fucking scientists. Do you think your tool kit is important right now? My tools need to be clean. Look at me. I have responsibilities here. I need to meet my shifts. We're... We're so close to having enough for the high-grade O2. That could help you. It could slow down the symptoms. Don't do that. Don't do that. What? You can say that you're afraid, but don't you dare use me as an excuse. You're better than that, Ethan. What? What are you talking about? You're everything to me. I-I can look after you. I can help you. I-I can make more money. I can make you okay. Who's to say that time is anything we should mess with anyway? What if I can't change anything? Who's to say that we can't? Okay. What if I could? What if I mess with something, and it makes everything worse? I can't believe what I'm hearing right now. No. I'm not going to risk losing you. XANTHE: You can't lose me. Of course I can. You've got to have faith, Eth, that you can be bigger. Faith isn't going to protect you. Now is not the time to have your tail between your legs. We're a team. Why aren't you on my side? Last year, I had 20 kids in my class. This year, I have 12. I saw three of them suffocate right in front of me. You're the only one I care about. I wouldn't be with you if I thought that was true. I'm afraid too, Ethan. I know that you'll come back to me. I believe in you. [SCREAMS] Papa! Fuck. YOUNG ETHAN: Papa... [WHEEZES] Your father is not here. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SCREAMS] I don't care if I can only find one dose of this cure. Xanthe gets the first one, or I'm not going. You need me. Okay, Ethan. We have a deal. [RADIO CHATTER] BILLY: These aren't just space suits, Ethan. These are my babies. Fenrir is not quite ready, but, Tyr, she'll get you there. She'll protect you. The Chronicle, at this time, can't tether to itself in the future. There's something wrong at the other end. What the hell does that mean? It means we're going to have to throw you there. Throw me there? BILLY: Without being tethered at the other end, there's a chance you could land inside a mountain or the ocean, so... You've got to be kidding me. We have to aim a little higher. [BREATHING HEAVILY] REGINA: We'll land you as close as we can to the source of the radio waves. You just find the people. Track them down and bring the cure back home to us. ETHAN: Sounds easy. This may be humankind's most critical journey. I'm counting on you to find a way back, Ethan. [BREATHING DEEPLY] BILLY: Okay. One more time, focus. Who's this? - ETHAN: Archie. - Yeah. What does Archie do? ETHAN: Um, systems analysis, navigation, communication. Yeah. That's right. Archie is your only friend, so treat her well. The suit will feed your vitals back to us from Archie, so we're going to know you're safe. We'll be watching. Hold your breath. Look at me. Do not let go. [ETHAN BREATHES SHAKILY] GRID: Timing quantum forward. ETHAN: Look after her. Only till you get back. [CHRONICLE POWERING UP] [BOTH SHOUT] See you soon, brother. Go bring back the light. GRID: Ignition in 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. [ETHAN SCREAMS] WOMAN: Ethan. ETHAN: [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING STOPS] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [GASPING] [SCREAMING] [GROANS] [COUGHS] [HIGH-PITCHED WHINE] [GROANING] [WHEEZES] [BREATHES DEEPLY] Hello. Come on. Ethan Whyte. Come in! Ethan Whyte to base. Come in! [ARCHIE CHIMES] - Archie? - ARCHIE: Hello, Ethan. Archie, where are we? ARCHIE: Let me find a satellite. [BEEPS] Satellite link failed. Location unknown. Searching. Searching. [BEEPS] Satellite link failed. Archie, geography magnetics, go. ARCHIE: I have detected a structure. It's not far. Follow me. [ARCHIE BEEPING] Fuck. [BREATHES DEEPLY] [GASPS] [HYPERVENTILATING] Am I going to die here? Fuck you. Archie? ARCHIE: I'm here, Ethan. Why are there two of me here at once? ARCHIE: I don't think this is a second you, Ethan. I think this is you. So I'm dead and alive at the same time? ARCHIE: Even I have trouble with time travel, Ethan. Very helpful, thanks. ARCHIE: My pleasure. [GRUNTS] Archie? BOTH ARCHIES: Yes, Ethan? Status. ARCHIE: Nuclear cell at 2%, display offline. Replay last recording. ETHAN: Am I going to die here? Maybe it's better this way. No one is suffering anymore. What did you have to sacrifice? I am your family. [STATIC] you. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Ah, please! Please! [SCREAMING] No, no! [GUNSHOT] ARCHIE: Power failure. Shutting down. Goodbye. No, no, no, no! Archie! Archie! [ARCHIE WHIRS] Diagnose. ARCHIE: Signal found. It's an emergency beacon. We should make contact. Follow me. [BEEPING] Hello? Hello? ARCHIE: Rub the sticks together. Friction makes fire. Easy, peasy. Rub. Rub. Easy, peasy. - Easy, peasy. - ETHAN: Easy, peasy. Easy, peasy. ARCHIE: Fire takes time, Ethan. Come on. ARCHIE: Rub, rub, rub. Even I have trouble with fire. Come on! ARCHIE: Keep at it! - Easy, peasy. - Ugh! ARCHIE: Rub, rub, rub! - Ugh! - ARCHIE: Good. Now blow. Blow, blow, blow, blow. Fire! Easy, peasy. [ARCHIE BEEPS] ARCHIE: Unidentified. Gee, thanks. Ugh. ARCHIE: Scanning. Scanning. Star formations synchronized. Date... 2474 AD. [CHUCKLES] Stars. YOUNG ETHAN: Stars. Stars. How are we like stars? That's silly. Okay. Try this. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] So you see, Ethy, I will never let anything happen to you. [THUNDER CRASHES] [GROANING] [SCREAMS] Fuck you! Fuck you! [SCREAMS] Ah! [SCREAMS] [FIRE CRACKLING] [GASPS] DISTORTED VOICE: No, wait. Ethan, please. You're not real! You're not real! You're not real! DISTORTED VOICE: Ethan, you're hallucinating. What the... What the hell? DISTORTED VOICE: You poisoned yourself because of the gallberries. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Jude? You're going to be okay, kid, as long as you do what I say. JUDE: Right away, we knew something was wrong. We could see your pulse echoing back. Then your blood-toxicity level spiked. Poison. Your heart stopped. You know, I watched you die, Ethan. I'm not dead. Am I? I don't think so. But Billy said he had just enough power to fire the Chronicle one last time. I grabbed a second suit. Couldn't leave you down here all by your lonesome. I told him I could bring you back. You came for me. JUDE: I hit the ground like a ton of bricks. Everything was destroyed... my suit, everything. I'm just happy to be alive, man, happy to see your ugly mug, happy to be breathing without a fucking mask. Xanthe? Man, she needs you. There's a problem. What the hell is this? ETHAN: I thought you saved me, but I'm still dead. JUDE: No. No. This isn't right. I mean, this isn't you. ETHAN: I thought you said I was poisoned. You were. I mean, we changed that. Didn't we? Something is very wrong. You think? Listen, was there anything else here? Like... like what? A gun? I'd say whoever left that hole in my head took off with it. Listen, this fucking bag of bones is not you. Been eating berries again, huh? [CHUCKLES] Well, whoever sent for me, for them to survive this long to regrow this place, they must have found a cure. If I don't find them in time, Xanthe's... - Well, let's find them. - Yeah. We were sent here for a reason. [ARCHIE BEEPING] Now we follow the bread crumbs. ARCHIE: Emergency beacon saturation 98%. We're close. JUDE: Ready? Let's see if anyone's home. I got your back. [WHIRRING] Hello? Careful. Hello? [GASPS] JUDE: Ethan! Hey, stick with me, Jude. I can't see shit. Activate what? [SIGHS] [SCREAMS] Ah! Shit! [ETHAN BREATHING HEAVILY] Come out! [POWERING UP] Access? Not possible. REGINA: Hello, GRID One. Hail Mary, brother. GRID: Hello, relegating 1,270. Ethan Whyte, DNA identity confirmed. Chronicle access granted. Portal priming sequence commencing. Countdown commencing. Four hours to portal activation. Destination 2067 AD. JUDE: Ethan. Ethan, if this puppy still works, we can use it to get home. Where are the people? Doesn't look like anyone's home. This doesn't make sense. This is all wrong. I'm just looking at what's in front of me, man, and I see a lifeboat. I thought when you saved me from the poison that it changed the course of everything. Obviously, it changed nothing. What does that mean? It means there's something bigger at play. When this thing scanned my blood, the light, it's been red my whole life. It just changed to green. This one, from the skeleton, it was already green. So what? It means the dead me has been through this before. - The dead you? - Every step I'm taking, he took. Are you listening to yourself? How is that possible? It's like he's my future. It's like I'm becoming him. It's not possible! You got to bring it down, brother. You're losing your mind, man. - ETHAN: Grid? - GRID: Yes, Ethan? Does this thing give me access to the Chronicle's data backup? GRID: Yes, Ethan. Decode the system logs. RICHARD: Chronicle log number one... We are at the beginning of a journey that could change everything. My name is Professor Richard Whyte, and I'm the lead physicist of the Chronicle Project. We have discovered an anomaly in the Higgs field, which might soon allow us to send radio waves and eventually matter through time. Stop! What makes you think you're going to find what you're looking for? I have to. No, you don't. We have buried an atmospheric monitoring station. It will continue to operate, and if it reaches a time in the future when the air is breathable, it will send this data back to us through the Chronicle. Our hope is that the Chronicle will help us learn from our descendants how they replenished the O2 levels. Enough. This is going to hurt more than it helps. I can't run from him forever. Please. Log 97. Bring your A game, people. Prep the countdown. Our entire lives have led to this moment. We are preparing subject number one, the radio-wave packet that will ping the Chronicle in the future. If it works, we should get an echo with data on the O2 levels. GRID: Firing ping in 3, 2, 1. Echo received. Ping returned. Date... 2474 AD. [CHEERING] It works! GRID: Ping data decoded. Data has been manually overridden at destination. English words encoded in transmission. English? What? [BEEPING] Jesus. What in God's name? RICHARD: I didn't do this. How is this possible? You need to make this work. It is working. Someone is calling for my son. How the fuck do they know about your son? I can't explain this. Don't tell me that. We all have families. It is working. Someone sent us this message. There is someone at the other end. So we move to the next phase. How long before we can test sending matter? We can't. Speak. There's a problem with the power at 2474. [ALARM BLARES] GRID: Warning, nuclear core power failure. Warning, Chronicle systems offline. ETHAN: Archie, diagnose. ARCHIE: Nuclear core, cold-fusion power feed corrupt. What does that mean? ARCHIE: The portal will not tether to 2067, Ethan. There is not enough power. Archie, where is the failure? ARCHIE: Searching. Searching. Nuclear core control room, access via service tunnel section seven. - Grid? - GRID: Yes, Jude Mathers? JUDE: Why hasn't the countdown stopped? GRID: Jude Mathers, the Chronicle priming sequence has commenced and cannot be stopped. The system would reach unstable particle levels. Define unstable. GRID: If the power feed is not reconnected before the countdown reaches zero, the charged particles in the Chronicle will create a nuclear explosion. JUDE: Nuclear explosion doesn't sound good. Let's not die today, Eth. ETHAN: Wait. If they received this message all that time ago, they knew about the power failure. Grid, if we fix the Chronicle's power, how long will portal stay open before the nuclear core drains? GRID: Once the countdown reaches zero, the portal will tether to 2067 for approximately 30 seconds. JUDE: Eth, it's going to take us hours to get down to the core. We got to gun it there now. Jesus Christ. Did you not see what I just saw? Someone sent that message from here! That... That means they fixed this place. That means they have a cure! They can help me fix Xanthe. Yeah, whoever sent the message, they're not here. Why didn't they tell us about the power failure? Why did they send you? What? I came to save you, stab antitoxin in your dead body. But why not send a soldier or... or a medic? Well, who else is going to damn near kill themselves to save your thankless ass? Listen, man. You were right. We can't save everyone, but I can save you. - Let's go. - No. No. I was wrong. I need to figure this out. [ARCHIE BEEPS] We've got one shot at fixing this thing. One shot, Ethan. I can't do it without you, brother, so let's take control. We've got to take control, little brother. I need... I need more time. So don't you want to see Xanthe again? Don't use her like that. I'm not going to let you get yourself killed. Get off me. [ALARM BLARING] Please, wake up, kid. I mean, I have never let you down, so don't let me down now. GRID: 3 hours, 50 minutes to nuclear explosion. Okay. Okay. Okay, whoever sent the message, they're not here. Now we just need to make our way down to the access tunnel. We need to turn the power on, and then we'll have enough time to find them. 3 hours, 50 minutes, tick tock. The city should be right here. They never found a way to survive. The Earth just waited for us to die. [SIGHS] JUDE: Eth, where have you taken us? 'Cause this ain't the way. They just died here in the classroom, just sitting here. Everything just got worse. They didn't even remove the dead. Does this mean that we failed? Eth. Eth. Eth, don't. Ethan. Xanthe. It's okay, buddy. SELENE: Don't you dare leave again. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Richard, where are you? What have you done to him? No. What? No. I don't... I... No. I don't understand. You're going to have to tell him yourself. Ethy... RICHARD: Ethy, listen to me. I need you to go for a little walk with your mom. - Papa, I want to stay here. - RICHARD: I will meet you. I promise. Do you understand? You have to trust me now. [CAN CLATTERS] SELENE: Okay. You have to climb up there, baby. Quick. Climb, baby. Just go. Just go, baby. - Mom! - SELENE: Climb. Just climb, please, climb. - Mom! - SELENE: Ethan. We don't have any money. - Please. He's just a boy. - [GUN COCKS] Please. No! No! [WHEEZING] No! Mama. No. Mama, no. Mama. I'm with you. [WHEEZES] No! [CRYING] Mama! [MAN GRUNTING] [COUGHS] [WHEEZING] Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. [GROANS] Papa. [GASPING] Breathe. Come on, breathe. You've got to fight for yourself now. Your father's not here. Breathe. Breathe. - No! - JUDE: Breathe. - No! No! - JUDE: Breathe. - [HYPERVENTILATING] - Breathe. Breathe. There, you go. - Jesus. - I have to get back to her. I have to. I know. How could I leave her alone? Well, you did what you thought was right, Eth. Did I? I promised her I'd come back. We're in control of our fate, right? Just got to have fucking faith. Just got to have faith. I-I can't lose her again. This is not your fault. I left her to die. JUDE: Hey. You're not him, Eth. What if we can't change anything? Maybe it's not our place. ETHAN: That can't be true. There... There has to be a way. It's dust and... dust and bones. ETHAN: It can't be the only way. It can't. - We... - No more detours. Maybe it's better this way. No one's suffering anymore. Come on. What did you just say? JUDE: What? What? Archie... Archie, repeat last playback. Who is that? JUDE: Maybe it's better this way. No one is suffering anymore. ARCHIE: Data corrupt. Skipping ahead. ETHAN: What did you have to sacrifice? JUDE: I did this for you. ETHAN: You did this for yourself. JUDE: This is our fate, Ethan. - There is no other way. - ETHAN: Wait. What did you say? No, no, no! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] - ETHAN: No! - JUDE: Fight me! I'm so sorry. ETHAN: No, no. [GUNSHOT] ARCHIE: Power failure. Shut down. What are you... What are you doing? Why the fuck is my voice in that thing? You tell me. Why did you hide that from me? Why did you hide that from me? And why do you have a gun? It's protection. From what? You said it yourself. This place, it... it's dust and bones. Protection from what, me? Are you going to shoot me, brother? What? You're losing your mind. That's not me on that thing. Jude, Jude, give me the gun. I'm in control. - Please. - JUDE: Why did you trick me? Please, please, please, please, Jude. - Give me the gun. - Stay right there. - Just... Just... - Stay right there. Just give me the gun, Jude. Please. You know how my skeleton got there, don't you? ARCHIE: Warning... two hours to nuclear explosion. - Please, please, please, please. - Move. [ALARM BLARING] You want to tell me what you're doing? Saving you from yourself. Move. [ELECTRICITY POPPING] Looks like we found our problem. GRID: Emergency reroute required. ETHAN: It's so fried. We've got to reroute the power. Archie, reroute stability. ARCHIE: Reroute stability 30%, Ethan. Okay. Hit it. Come on. [POWERING UP] [POWERING DOWN] ARCHIE: Power reroute failure. Damn it. Give us a fucking chance. [RUMBLING] GRID: Evacuate service chamber. Eth, look out! The door. [GRUNTS] GRID: Depressurization required. Grid, override. GRID: Unable to comply. ETHAN: It won't work. We need to manually pull the backup breaker while the room is depressurized. Am I going to die in here? GRID: Purging O2. You aren't. JUDE: Ethan! Ethan! No! YOUNG ETHAN: Stars? [DISTORTED] How are we like stars? [AIR RUSHING] GRID: Power restored. Nuclear core active. JUDE: Grid, system status. GRID: Chronicle systems online. Critical systems nominal. 37 minutes to portal launch. Thank fucking Christ. [LAUGHS] Where does this go? [PANEL BEEPS] No. No. No. - What? - How didn't I-I see it? See what? ETHAN: The... The... The... The future. It's... It's already written. We're just turning the fucking pages. JUDE: Give that to me. No. Ethan, stop playing games. I-I am going to die. What happens next, Jude? I-I thought that when we changed my death, it meant that I could change fate... mine, Xanthe's, everyone's. But the skeleton, it... it's still there. My skeleton is still here. Why are we still talking about a fucking skeleton? ETHAN: My skeleton is still here because we can't change anything. Everything was always going to play out this way. No matter what we do, it's leading us to that moment. You're confusing yourself, Ethan. No. We're going to go home, and you're going to shoot me in the head, and I'm going to rot in that hallway for 400 years. Am I not useful to you anymore, brother? You wouldn't lie to me. Why would I? Why would I? Because you know I'm never going to see her again. I'm protecting you. By putting a fucking gun to my head? [CRYING] - Archie... - Put that fucking thing away. - ARCHIE: Yes, Ethan? - ...play last recording. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] ETHAN: Please, no. No. No. Find me! No. - I wouldn't. - ETHAN: No! [GUNSHOT] Fuck. The second I got here, it was... it was staring me in the face. I-I just didn't want to believe it was you. - It's not me, Ethan. - ETHAN: Why? Why wait until we get back to do it? Why not just fucking do it now? How could you do that to me? It's not the plan. What plan? - We've got to get out of here. - What fucking plan? If we leave now, we can change everything. Get off. Fuck! - What fucking plan? - You've got to trust me. I'm protecting you, God damn it. Fuck! Fuck. GRID: 30 minutes to portal launch. I'm in control. I'm in control. This place is alive, Ethan. There's no reason we can't live here. And leave everyone to die? JUDE: Ethan. There's no masks. You can't stop them. I saved you, Ethan, but we can't save everyone. You've lost your fucking mind. Stay away from me. JUDE: Ethan! My birthday. I've made a terrible mistake. We can't play God. We don't belong in God's playground. Jude, what the fuck? You're not going to find what you're looking for. Ethan, no! Ethan! There is no other way. Ethan! RICHARD: We don't belong in God's playground. We don't belong in God's playground. We don't belong in God's playground. JUDE: It won't change anything. RICHARD: Maybe one day I'll be there, and I can say... say this to your face. All of this was for you, Ethan. If I could give you the life I never had, then you'd know that I love you. Wouldn't you? It's the hardest thing, to admit what you're afraid of. I never had a father. I don't know if you know that. Why do I run away? I should have been there for you. I should have been there for you. I didn't know how. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Fuck. Grid, dial home. [BEEPING] SELENE: Richard, where are you? What have you done to him? Sweetheart, I don't have time to explain. I need you to take Ethan and leave the house. Meet me where we first met. SELENE: No. What? No. I don't understand. You're going to have to tell him yourself. Ethy. Ethy, I need you to go for a little walk with your mom. YOUNG ETHAN: Papa, I want to stay here. RICHARD: I will meet you. I promise. You have to trust me now. GRID: Entry granted. RICHARD: End call. Jude. JUDE: I can't let you do it. REGINA: What are you thinking now, Richard? RICHARD: This isn't about finding a cure anymore, is it? You want to escape, just leave the world behind. There is no cure. That message was sent by someone. There must be a cure. We have a responsibility. It's too late for that. This world is done, Richard. You want to save them all? Most of them would cut your throat for one breath of fresh air. They wouldn't know what to do with another chance. You're wrong. Even if we could save them, humans are a virus. The Earth will heal but never while we're suffocating it. - This isn't the way. - This is the only way. The Earth needs time without us, so we jump ahead. Start again, or humanity dies for nothing. Who, your chosen few? I know you've lost people, but you can't... This isn't about me, Richard. You're right. People are going to have to die. It's not an easy decision, but it's the right one. It's not what we want. It's what we need. You need to have faith. You're the scientist here. You want to talk about faith? I am not risking the survival of humanity on your faith. BILLY: Hey, Richard. Just wanted to say thank you so much for giving me this chance. I've run the numbers, and I'm sure it will work. I've got the design team working on a rough outline as we speak. An outline for what? What? Wait. Did Richard not authorize this? Is it going to work or not? I think so. Yes, I mean, it will take some time, but I think we can eventually jerry rig the Chronicle to fire a person one way, kind of like a... a slingshot or a... or a catapult. That's suicide. You're going to kill someone. With some kind of protective suit, they might have a chance. All we need is one person to fix the power on the Chronicle in the future, right? We fix the power, she opens up the portal, and we can go safely through. REGINA: The ping came back. There's oxygen there. It proves the plan has already worked. Earth regrows only because mankind doesn't make it. RICHARD: No! I don't believe it's the only way. I've locked the system so only Ethan's DNA can activate the Chronicle at the other end. Somebody sent for him, and whether you believe or not, you need him if you want to open the portal. Can you do it? Can you get one person through? I mean, I think it might be possible, but it's Richard's science, so... Can you make it work? - Can you make it work? - Yes! [RICHARD'S BODY THUDS] [CRYING] Oh, fuck! Fuck! [SHOUTS] Stop! Stop! Damn it, stop! Stop. Ms. Jackson, I-I don't... I don't... Go down with a team. Make sure the boy stays alive. You will be his guardian. Let nothing happen to him. You understand? He's the key to everything now. I know. GRID: 30 minutes to portal launch. Fuck you. You fucking liar! All this time, you used me! You used me. They used us. I was just a kid, man. They're still coming, Ethan, even if you try and stop them, and the world you care so much about, they died for nothing. That can't be true. We can't change the past. Even if we could, what would happen to this place? What would happen to us? I don't know! But we can't leave millions of people to die! They have already died! It's already happened, man! There is no cure! Eth, you said it yourself. Things can't be changed, little brother. I'm not your brother. You sound like your father now. You know, if he had listened to Jackson, he'd still be here. Only the strong survive, Ethan. So you bought yourself a place in the new world. What did you have to sacrifice? Me? Xanthe? I am your family. I did this for you. You did this for yourself. There has to be another way. I have to stop this thing. - No, I can't let you. - I have to stop this thing. There is no other way. [GRUNTS] This is our fate. - [ETHAN GRUNTS] - There is no other way. [GRUNTS] - What did you say? - I'm sorry. - No, no, no! - I'm sorry. No, no! - Fight me. - [CHOKING] Ethan, Ethan, Ethan. Fight me. - Fight me. - Please! - No! No! - Fight me! No! No, no! Don't do it! Don't do it! - Fight me! Fight me! - Please, no, no, no! Fight me! No! Help me! You got to fight for yourself now. Fight me! Help. [SCREAMS] Please. You got to fight me. I believe in you. I believe in you. It is me. I can change. I'm so sorry. [GUNSHOT] [BREATHING SHAKILY] [CRYING] Ohh, geez. [DEVICE BEEPING] [COMPUTER BEEPING] Distinguished friends, you have stood with me while you watched your world fall down around you. This is our time. Each one of you has played a part in bringing us to this point. History will not forget you. This day will be marked as the day that we proved that we will not go quietly into the night, the day the human race took control of its fate. I have it on good authority that you are going to grow up to be someone very important. This is going to hurt, but it will help you become who you are meant to be. One day you'll understand it. You will want to trust what you can see with your own eyes, but it won't be enough, and you'll need to make a choice about whether you believe in something bigger. - Archie? - ARCHIE: Yes, Ethan? Someone is here. ARCHIE: Who is here, Ethan? I'm here. [BREATHES DEEPLY] I believe. YOUNG ETHAN: Believe in... believe in what? Believe in people. - No! - Fight me! RICHARD: I'm sorry. GRID: Incoming particle stream. Ethan. He's a liability. Shoot him. Leave him here. Once we're gone, it won't matter. Remember the drill. We have one shot. Once the portal opens, we have 30 seconds to clear through. GRID: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Tether interrupted. Shutting down. No. No. No. No. No. No! [RATTLING] ChroniCorp's headquarters were raided just moments ago after this news station received an anonymous broadcast. Officials seized hundreds of believed-extinct plants. If what we are hearing is true, this may be the second chance the world so desperately needs for ecological regeneration. Religious groups are already calling it the deus ex machina, or God out of the machine. GRID: Entry request. Entry request. Security override. [DOOR OPENS] Xanthe Whyte? [GASPS] [CRYING] YOUNG ETHAN: Stars? How are we like stars? Silly. Okay. Here. Here, try this. What's between us? Your hands. No. Here. Imagine for a moment that we are all physically connected by the very fabric of the universe. An invisible field that bonds us together, everything in the universe. It's you, me, the stars. We are all connected through time. So you see, Ethy, even when I'm not with you, we are always together.
