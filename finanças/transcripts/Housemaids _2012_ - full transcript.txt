Hi, my name is Luiz Felipe. ﻿I have been asked to make a documentary ﻿about our housemaid, Ludimar ﻿She has been with us since I was one. ﻿Sixteen years. ﻿The lady that works in our house is called Helena. But, everybody calls her Lena. ﻿She has been with us for almost 16 years. ﻿The age of my brother. ﻿I'll try again. ﻿Hi, my name is Neto. ﻿Claudemiro Neto. ﻿My housemaid is Vanusa, also known as Vává ﻿HOUSEMAIDS ﻿Once upon a time there was an island, ﻿where Love, Joy and other sentiments lived. ﻿One day Love asked Grief. ﻿"Grief, can you take me away?" ﻿"No, Love." ﻿"I am very sad." ﻿"I prefer to go alone." ﻿Then along came Joy. ﻿but Joy was so happy she didn't hear Love calling. ﻿Suddenly, a boat approached, ﻿with an old man aboard, who said to Love, "Come". ﻿"I'll take you with me." ﻿Love was so radiant with happiness, ﻿that he forgot to ask the old man's name. ﻿When he reached the top of the highest hill, ﻿He remembered to ask Wisdom. ﻿"Wisdom, who was the one who saved me?" ﻿"Love, who brought you here was Time." ﻿"Time?" exclaimed Love. ﻿"Yes, Love. Time." ﻿"Only Time is capable of understanding a great Love." ﻿Ah, this message is so beautiful! ﻿Wow, it's hot! ﻿Hi! ﻿This is Vanusa. ﻿Vanusa has been our housemaid for 17 years ﻿and I am making a film about her. ﻿How long have you been our chauffeur for? ﻿Chauffeur? 10 years. ﻿I thought it was cool to drive a car. ﻿And your aunt said she would talk to your mom about me driving. ﻿I said "Really?", "Really." ﻿But I didn't take what she said very seriously. ﻿Then, when I arrived the next day, your mom said to me. ﻿"Vanusa, Daniele said that you want to learn to drive." ﻿And I said "Yes ﻿I told her that my father and brother drive. ﻿So she asked if I would go for it, and I said yes. ﻿Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a chauffeur? ﻿Or a housemaid? ﻿To be honest, ﻿this was my first job after moving in with my husband ﻿When I was eleven I started working in a family home. ﻿I was the nanny. ﻿I started working to help my mother with the household expenses. ﻿When I went to live with husband I stopped working ﻿I started working again when I was 24-year-old. ﻿Carry on talking, imagine the camera isn't here. ﻿Where's the manioc flour? ﻿The manioc flour? ﻿It's on the hob. ﻿What's this Dinha? ﻿I don't know, Madame. Mr. Vladimir put it in his tea yesterday. ﻿Is it still OK? ﻿It has been here more than a year. ﻿What is its sell by date? ﻿There isn't one, but Madame bought it. ﻿Today Vanusa will show us her personal space in the house. ﻿Maybe we will find something interesting there. ﻿It's a bit of a tight fit in here. ﻿But you have to have your own little space, right? ﻿My little heart-shaped box. ﻿I was given it. ﻿There is so much stuff in here. ﻿I think a cockroach might even fly out! ﻿No, for the love of God. ﻿My cake, ﻿Your cake, Claudemiro Neto. ﻿My cake made by you. ﻿That's right. ﻿My cakes were always made by you. ﻿Claudemiro Neto. ﻿My God, I was really fat. ﻿Then I got skinny and then I got fat again. ﻿Do you like to read? I like it. ﻿"The Son of Pain." ﻿I like it and I need to read, you know? ﻿This here Neto is very sad. You understand. ﻿I bought this book to see if it would help me help my son. ﻿He is addicted to drugs. ﻿I talk a lot with him about it. ﻿because no-one wants to be a drug-addict, ﻿Nobody wants to put their family through this. ﻿But it's hard to get clean. ﻿Very hard, you know? ﻿Johnie? ﻿What key, Johnie? ﻿No, the key... ﻿what? ﻿You don't need it? ﻿So what do you want me to do then? ﻿No, we left the door open. Is the front gate shut? ﻿The key is with Rodrigo. ﻿If we lock it, it's because we have a reason to, right Johnie? ﻿You know that. ﻿Don't call me names like that. ﻿Talk to me properly. Yes, Johnie. ﻿God help us. ﻿You're not, are you? ﻿Johnie, let me tell you something. ﻿If we go out and take the key with us. ﻿It's because we've got a reason to. ﻿But you can have the key if you promise to keep it with you. ﻿"And I stayed all alone" "Just thinking of the words" ﻿"She told me she was leaving" ﻿"Going crazy suffering" ﻿"So I decided to stay" "﻿Please cancel my ticket" ﻿"I don't want to go alone anymore." ﻿"How could I give her this letter How could I leave like this" ﻿"This is my home and why leave if I am happy" ﻿"If I already have love And can live in peace" ﻿"So I have decided to stay..." ﻿You're not late, are you? Why did you separate? ﻿When I got married, he was 19 and I was 15. ﻿And when I say "married" I mean I lived with him for 23 years, ﻿for me that means married. ﻿He was always a responsible person at work, you know? ﻿My separation was because of his disinterest in my son. ﻿My son was growing up ﻿and needed his father around more. ﻿He worked away from home a lot. ﻿He's a professional builder. ﻿He would work away a lot ﻿spend a month, six weeks away. ﻿Afterwards he began to spend more time at home. ﻿But he used to cheat on me a lot. ﻿Especially when he travelled. ﻿I don't want to get out of the car. Ok. Bye. ﻿It doesn't fit. ﻿It's for a SIM card, not this thing. ﻿Let's get out? ﻿I don't want to go to English. ﻿Me neither. ﻿Bye all. Have a good class. ﻿Claudemiro, Ruben's going to collect you, ok? ﻿Ok. ﻿"This passion... needs to teach my heart" ﻿"never to fall in love again" ﻿Now, I need to calm down, not get so mad" ﻿"Stop the rotten part of love, before it spreads" ﻿"So that I will not have to suffer or cry again" "Now everyone!" ﻿"Love is great when it works out" ﻿"When you love and are loved in return" ﻿"When it brings joy to your heart" ﻿"But when love goes bad, it makes you so sad" ﻿"And you need to cut it out from the root" ﻿"And be very careful not to get hurt" ﻿But it is so difficult... ﻿"Love is great when it works out" ﻿"When you love and are loved in return" ﻿"When it brings joy to your heart" ﻿"But when love turn bad, it makes you so sad" ﻿"You need to cut it out at the root" ﻿"And be very careful not to get hurt." ﻿It is so difficult to love, and not be valued and respected. ﻿And then to suffer, that's even harder. ﻿If you want, later on... ﻿I can tell you how I came to São Paulo ﻿Sure, I'd like that, yes. ﻿I arrived here married. My first husband was a relative. We got married and came here. ﻿My father sold two cows, or maybe it was two bulls. ﻿And gave the money to my husband as a dowry. ﻿So that he could rent a small place here in São Paulo ﻿and buy a few things. ﻿We had nothing. ﻿We had to buy everything. ﻿But he conned me and my father. ﻿When we arrived here, ﻿he got a little place to put me. A cellar. ﻿He rented a room underneath the floor. ﻿How awful! ﻿The room didn't even have proper walls, no plaster. ﻿The bathroom was outside. ﻿And I didn't leave the house. ﻿A neighbor told me to go out a little, but I was scared, ﻿because he threatened me. ﻿I wanted to work but he said no. He was very jealous. ﻿And the money that my father gave him vanished. ﻿Drinking. Rum. The money disappeared ﻿But I don't like doing nothing. ﻿Even when I was pregnant, he would bring me bags of clothes to wash ﻿from people at his workplace. ﻿I would wash, iron and he would take them back to the men at the company. ﻿He would collect the payment and I never saw a penny ﻿I always had work to do ﻿but the money never touched my hands. ﻿But I'm OK. Thank God. ﻿Very well. ﻿But these marriages of mine. ﻿Never turned out well. ﻿The first wasn't good, but the second is great, isn't it? ﻿- No? - No. ﻿I made this at home you know. ﻿Everyone liked it. ﻿You made this at home? ﻿I did. ﻿And what did everyone think? ﻿My two sisters were visiting and they loved it. ﻿Really? ﻿They had it for breakfast and as an afternoon snack. ﻿Amen. ﻿Now you drink the wine. ﻿The bread stays covered so it doesn't get jealous of the wine. ﻿It could get jealous because we drink the wine first ﻿After the wine we uncover the bred. ﻿So that it can be happy. ﻿Really, the bread has precedence over all other food. We should really do the bread first, ﻿But the tradition during the shabat is to drink the wine first. ﻿Because the bread holds precedence, we cover it, in respect. ﻿It's very good Dilma! ﻿Thank you Dilma! ﻿It's delicious. ﻿Did you enjoy it? ﻿You know I dreamt about it? ﻿That you celebrated Shabat with us? ﻿Around 3 months ago. ﻿I did and I told my daughter about it ﻿that in the dream I was sitting at the table with you all. ﻿My daughter said it was crazy. ﻿Maybe, but I dreamt it. ﻿That I was invited to participate in the Shabat. ﻿My daughter joked that it could only be in my dreams! ﻿Then, when I arrived home last Saturday and told her. ﻿She said "Wow, your dream!" ﻿It was wonderful! ﻿You really enjoyed it? ﻿I loved it. It's the start of many good things to come! ﻿You can't even imagine. ﻿Why? ﻿I'll tell you later. ﻿Did you know what being Jewish meant before you worked here? ﻿To be honest, I thought you were all bad people. ﻿I did. ﻿I worked in another Jewish household where I was treated really badly. ﻿I swore that I would never work in a Jewish house again. ﻿But it has been totally different this time. ﻿What did you think when you first met us? ﻿Did it feel different? - I felt strange. - Did you feel strange? ﻿Why? ﻿Because of the food. ﻿What did you think of the food? ﻿I would eat it and feel weak. ﻿As if the food couldn't sustain me. ﻿But as time went by, I began to like the food. ﻿Today I love the food. ﻿I make this food! ﻿You know I cook it at home too? ﻿It's delicious! ﻿Wait a minute! Don't go anywhere. ﻿Hello? ﻿Let's dance! And make plans Let’s make plans! ﻿Let's talk about the problems of the American people ﻿Gracinha, it's really loud. ﻿My name is Alana and I am 16 years old. ﻿My housemaid, Gracinha, has developed nocturnal habits, working at night. ﻿You're going to drink your coffee whilst sorting that out? ﻿Yes, I am. ﻿Tell me if I'm going to hit anything. ﻿There's nothing behind you. Only your grandmother. ﻿There's not much space under here. ﻿Do you do this every night? ﻿I do this in the middle of the night, when you're sleeping. ﻿When you're not sleeping, you're in your bedroom right? ﻿Alana, man, don't film me. ﻿I've just cleaned the sofa with my blouse! ﻿Whenever I see this sofa it makes me want to lie down. ﻿When you see anything you feel like lying down! ﻿Or to lean on something! ﻿Argentina and Uruguay! ﻿Argentina are in the goalie's hands. ﻿Uruguay in the semi-final. Argentina knocked out again at home. ﻿This is the most beautiful anthem in the world. ﻿We are the triple-colored class. We are the champion's voice. ﻿We are the cry of the people. ﻿I want the world to know that this anthem is from Bahia. ﻿Bahia Sport Football Club. ﻿Let's go, we will be the winners ﻿Let's go, conquer one more title ﻿Bahia, Bahia, Bahia ﻿Do you think we should film anything again? ﻿I don't think so. ﻿We don't know everything that she wants us to film. ﻿What did she say she wanted us to do? ﻿Film interesting things. ﻿What's interesting here? ﻿So far the only interesting thing was my anthem! ﻿I'm going to have a quick nap before finishing off the chores. ﻿She's going to have a rest on the table. ﻿If I lie on my bed I won't wake up, and I still have a lot to do. ﻿If it wasn't good working here I wouldn't have been here for 13 years. ﻿- Not that long, is it? - ﻿Quite. I've spent more time here than I spent with my mother. ﻿When you stop to think about it. ﻿I started working when I was 11 years old. ﻿Sometimes I feel home-sick ﻿when I'm alone in my room, I get a little sad, ﻿and feel homesick. ﻿But at the moment there are so many problems at home I prefer it here. ﻿It's 11.54 pm. ﻿Gracinha is asleep, leaning on the sofa. ﻿You're in your bra, Gracinha! ﻿- You see anything? - Yes! ﻿- No you didn't - I did! Ok. ﻿The big beauty! ﻿My stars! ﻿My team! ﻿How often do you go home? ﻿Once a fortnight. ﻿Normally once every two weeks. ﻿Sometimes I stay a little longer. ﻿When it's necessary, ﻿when someone travels. ﻿When you father travels, I stay. ﻿When your grandmother gets ill, I also stay. ﻿Then, when everything gets back to normal I take my days off at home. ﻿But, at the beginning of the year. ﻿I spent 3 months here, without going home ﻿You know why. Your grandmother had a knee operation ﻿and I had to assist her recuperation. ﻿I never imagined though ﻿that they would be the last 3 months of my son's life ﻿the only son I had ﻿who was murdered. ﻿And I hardly saw him this year. ﻿Sometimes Alana Sometimes. Yeah. We don't ever imagine that things like this could happen to us. ﻿But they happen. ﻿And only when it is too late ﻿we realize that we could have done so many things differently. ﻿This is where I sleep. ﻿It is an orthopedic mattress. ﻿An orthopedic mattress that my boss bought for me. ﻿She Iso bought me this fan. ﻿With this I feel at home. ﻿Fernanda. ﻿She is like a older sister. ﻿I tell her all my secrets, ﻿all my worries, ﻿my romantic adventures. ﻿When I do something I shouldn't, she knows about it. ﻿Come on, let's have some porridge. ﻿Do you want some porridge? ﻿What are you crying about? ﻿What? ﻿- She wants a feed. - She has to wait. ﻿- She's hungry. - Ok, I'm going. ﻿Come on then, come to me. There you are, your mommy. ﻿Juju, stop filming me please. ﻿OK, I know ﻿My mum said, "The family is going to grow". ﻿And I said, "You're pregnant?". ﻿And mom, "No. Lena's pregnant". ﻿"We've already had the examinations and it's confirmed." ﻿Everyone was like, woo-hoo! ﻿And Lena's face was like, Oh my god, I'm pregnant! ﻿This is an improvised cot. ﻿Not really a cot. ﻿My mum is coming with Fernandinha to put her to sleep. ﻿She woke up. But she will go back to sleep. ﻿My name is Lucia. ﻿am 52 years old. ﻿Lena's parents lived on our land, on our ranch, with my parents. ﻿I saw Lena grow up. ﻿There was Lena and another person who worked on the farm. ﻿This other person wanted to come to Salvador, to live with me. ﻿But my sister said that it was better that we take Lena. ﻿We knew Lena's family better. ﻿And Lena also wanted to come. ﻿For as long as I can remember Lena has been here. ﻿Our relationship is really good. ﻿It is not a relationship of employer and employee. ﻿It's not that we or Lena are ashamed of her profession. ﻿It's just that it is more than that. ﻿We always say that she lives here, helps out around the house, ﻿she's family. ﻿We don't do that thing at lunch where she would sit in another place. ﻿Everybody sits together to eat lunch. ﻿If she wants, she can rest here in the house ﻿because her room is out the back. ﻿Inside the house there are 3 bedrooms, one is mine, one is my brother's ﻿and one is my mother's. ﻿Lena's room is out the back though. ﻿Here is Lena's bedroom, the master-suite. ﻿Here's her bed ﻿and here is Fernandinha's cot. ﻿With a mosquito net, so they can't bite her. ﻿Inside and outside the cot, ﻿Her toys. ﻿A TV. ﻿A wardrobe. ﻿Shelves. ﻿A montage of photos that my mom made. ﻿It has photos of Fernandinha since she was born. ﻿Fernandinha's father. ﻿Fernandinha ﻿my brother with her, my mom, ﻿me at the maternity ward with her. ﻿Me arriving at the hospital ﻿changing Fernanda's first clothes. ﻿Putting on her little shoes, ﻿Here I am putting on her clothes. ﻿When she returned home, I was also the first person to give her a bath. ﻿Lena is part of the family. ﻿People often ask what she is to us. ﻿And I say, "She's my daughter!" ﻿I am old enough for Lena to be my daughter. ﻿During the labour, I took her to the maternity ward, at 1.30am. ﻿When I got there I had to leave. ﻿Leaving her, I felt a kind of remorse. ﻿I wanted to be there. But I couldn't stay. ﻿I left feeling very worried about her. ﻿I worried about how she was. ﻿When we got the news that Maria Fernanda had been born, it was great. ﻿It was like having another child. ﻿As if another child of ours had arrived. ﻿It's my personality, to give myself completely to other people. ﻿Sorry, I'm a bit emotional. ﻿I always give myself 100% ﻿I give my all. ﻿I always say to Lena, that she will not stay here forever. ﻿Our children don't stay forever, ﻿so imagine a person who has just come to help. ﻿One day she will move on to something else ﻿because life doing housework can get tiring, I know. ﻿There are days when we get so tired of doing the same thing, the mundane. ﻿But there is an upside, there is an upside, ﻿She can count on us, the same way that we can count on her. ﻿But when the moment comes that she wants to leave. ﻿It will be very sad for us, but it will be her choice, of course. ﻿I'll get you in one minute, my sweetheart. ﻿You won't sleep by yourself, will you? ﻿Go on, sleep by yourself. ﻿Mommy is going to get you. ﻿Come here, little lady. ﻿I'll turn the light off, OK? ﻿Flavia, give me a tea-towel please! ﻿My name is Bia. My housemaid is Flávia. ﻿She looks after my brother. And helps my mother a lot. ﻿She washes the dishes, sweeps, makes the beds, washes clothes. ﻿My mom works as a housemaid as well, in another house. ﻿Now I'm going to film Flavia so that you can get to know her. ﻿Flávia, Bring the coffee. ﻿What is it? ﻿Heat up the coffee, Flávia. ﻿A team that has not lost at home for a year and a half. ﻿This morning, the police surrounded a hospital in São Paulo, ﻿it was reported that there was a bomb inside. A bomb? ﻿The special forces group of the military police. ﻿Let's see if you have done a poo. ﻿They removed explosives that were in the maternity ward. Hang on, wait a minute. ﻿Oh, what a lovely bath. ﻿Oops, I forgot the brush. ﻿Are you falling over? ﻿You been drinking have you baby? ﻿She fell over! ﻿She's dead! ﻿I won't let her touch you. ﻿Don't touch my arse ﻿I can't take it any more! ﻿That’s enough, Bia. ﻿Get away from him! ﻿I have suffered a lot, Bia. My story is long. ﻿It all started when I got pregnant in São Paulo ﻿was pregnant with triplets. ﻿Three little boys. ﻿I was six months pregnant when he kicked me ﻿twice in the stomach and I lost the babies. ﻿My beautiful, beautiful babies. ﻿All because of a woman, no, not a woman, a whore. ﻿She was a prostitute, very beautiful, I can't deny that ﻿and he chased her. ﻿Once, she came to talk to me and said she felt sorry for me. ﻿She said she recognized my suffering ﻿working to pay the rent and he repaid me by hitting me. We saw her out one night and I told him I wanted to go home. ﻿I knew that he liked her. ﻿I shouted, calling her a whore. ﻿It was then that he got on top of me and kicked me ﻿and I began to bleed, I haemorrhaged straight away. ﻿I was in agony and his aunt wanted to take me to hospital. ﻿But I said no. Not the hospital. I wanted him to learn. ﻿I spent all night with a fever, losing blood, in agony. ﻿The next day, the 1st of April, I couldn't take it anymore, ﻿I felt like I was dying, so weak, I had no strength. ﻿When I came to, I was in hospital, on a drip. ﻿I was in so much pain I urinated in the bed. ﻿The nurse shouted at me. ﻿Shouting because I peed in the bed. ﻿And there I was, with my legs closed shut, dying of pain, ﻿when I got to the bathroom, was going to pee in the toilet. ﻿But I thought, I can't wee here, and went to the shower area. ﻿When I knelt down, the babies fell out. ﻿They were all purple. ﻿You could even see the mark where he had kicked me. ﻿Since then I have never felt tenderness towards any man. ﻿I don't want to know about men. ﻿I live like this to survive. ﻿But I won't put up with any man. ﻿It's ok, Flavia. Get the bowl and come over here. ﻿Now what Bia? ﻿What shall I do now? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Drink some water, and start working. ﻿Get out from in front of the camera. ﻿Sweetheart, I'm the housemaid. ﻿I'm the one that has to be seen. ﻿What can I do, chic, that is how I am! ﻿Yeah, if you say so. ﻿If you've got it... ﻿So, keep quiet. ﻿Ok. ﻿What is my mom like as a boss? ﻿Your mom's great, Bia. I don't have anything to complain about. ﻿She doesn’t like to come home and see the house dirty ﻿or Mateus un-bathed ﻿then she gets annoyed, as any employer would. ﻿And she's a housemaid too. Her boss makes demands of her, ﻿so what do you expect? ﻿You have to make sure everything is clean and tidy. ﻿You know that your mom helps me too though. ﻿You're one ugly boy! Tell her she is the ugly one. ﻿You are ugly. ﻿Look whose talking. ﻿Say it again, Mateus. ﻿You are ugly. ﻿Let me get your cup, Mateus. ﻿It's tough looking after this handsome little boy, ﻿this cool little fella ﻿but his mum doesn't trust anyone else, nor do I. ﻿I like being with him, it enriches me. ﻿But when he grows up I won't want him anymore. ﻿He will be very big, old. And will have a big dick. ﻿I won't want to wash him anymore. ﻿You'll get yourself a woman to look after you. Won't you? ﻿What do you think Bia? ﻿Your sister will bath you. ﻿I'll leave. ﻿Who do you want to bath you? ﻿Who? ﻿Me? ﻿Not me, I'm leaving. ﻿See Bia, he doesn't want you. He wants me. ﻿My love! ﻿You were so pretty dressed in that baby doll camisole ﻿I covered my mouth win honey thinking only of you ﻿I want you my love and all your pleasures. ﻿And when you touch me ﻿I get all wet ﻿I get all goose-pimply ﻿You are a dirty little boy! Aren't you? ﻿Ahh, I'm tired... ﻿I'm tired of singing and dancing. ﻿Are you filming me? ﻿Sergio? ﻿Are you awake? ﻿Yes, yes. I'm on my way out. ﻿You arrived right on time. ﻿Just let me have a quick wash. ﻿What horrible weather! ﻿I'll just wash my hands, won't be a minute. ﻿Hey everybody, my name is Jennifer. ﻿I'm sixteen years old and I'm at high school. ﻿I do drama class every Saturday. ﻿After class I come home to a nice home cooked lunch. ﻿Thanks to my guardian angel ﻿my housekeeper. ﻿Come on girls. ﻿Come on Xena. ﻿Now it's cleaning up dog poo time. ﻿Can you see Chica? ﻿It's raining, so she won't be outside. ﻿Chica gets scared easily, doesn't she? ﻿She doesn't like the rain. ﻿Just like you! ﻿What I do most is get wet in the rain. ﻿We met him during a very difficult time in his life. ﻿He had just separated from his wife. ﻿She left him because he didn't have the means to maintain the house. ﻿It's a very sad story. ﻿My mom accompanied the whole process. ﻿They talked a lot and became friends. ﻿And then she asked him to look after me ﻿because she needed to work. ﻿So he started looking after me. And he is still here. ﻿He doesn't open up to anyone about his feelings. ﻿He lives in his own little world. ﻿He doesn't like to talk about his family or his children. ﻿He says he doesn't miss them. ﻿But we know that deep down he does. ﻿I fought a lot with his son. ﻿Because his son would only come to see him once a year. ﻿And when he did, he just said "Hi, Dad, Everything OK? Bye." ﻿His son wasn't really interested in him ﻿when he was sick he wouldn't look after him. ﻿And I fought with his son a lot because of this. ﻿I don't know if I should say this. ﻿But as I am already talking. ﻿I think that his son doesn't come to visit him because of me. ﻿I think his son is scared that if he comes to visit. ﻿I Will hand Sergio over to him. ﻿He has his space here with us. ﻿He eats my food and sits at the table with us. ﻿He lives with me as if he were a grandfather to my children. ﻿He helped me bring up my children. ﻿I am able to go out to work and at night because of him ﻿because I know that my daughters will be fed and bathed. ﻿Come in, come in! ﻿And the love of your life, where is she? ﻿She's outside. ﻿I'm going to film your room, OK? ﻿OK. ﻿Whilst you're filming I'm going to finish getting dressed. ﻿- The TV. - Jesus Christ over there. ﻿Show the picture of your mom. ﻿Look, it's us! ﻿Yup, it's us! ﻿There, look. ﻿- It's counting down already! - There's still time. ﻿By the clock in the kitchen it's already midnight. ﻿Let's see if it's on any other channel. ﻿Nothing. ﻿It's going to start. ﻿Mum, calm down. ﻿Look, there it goes. ﻿Is it already? ﻿Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! ﻿Merry Christmas! ﻿Hi, Lucimar. ﻿I'm making a documentary ﻿would it be alright to film you during a week? Show a bit of your day to day? ﻿Ok by me. ﻿Can you sign here then? ﻿Bye, Lucimar. ﻿Can you put my white trousers in the wash, please? ﻿- Of course. - Thank you. ﻿In the soap opera, how did Vinicius know about Serginho? ﻿That Serginho was trying to kill-him? ﻿- He guessed. - But how? ﻿Vinicius just said to Serginho, "it was you." ﻿He said that out of nowhere? ﻿Mom, I can't do it. ﻿Can you get me a fork? ﻿Luci, bring a knife and fork please. ﻿She's having a bit of difficulty with the salad. ﻿Thank you. ﻿- You're cutting it up, mom. - Because you couldn't manage it. ﻿Let's go Carol. ﻿Let's go out this way, I'm already here. ﻿Say bye to Luci. ﻿- Bye Carol. - Bye Luci. ﻿How long have you known Lucimar? ﻿Since I was born. ﻿She is the daughter of my great grandmother's housekeeper. ﻿My great grandmother had a ranch near Valença. ﻿And ever since I was tiny I would go there. ﻿So, I've known Lucimar my whole life. ﻿And what was your relationship like when you were children? ﻿Arriving in Valença, the first thing I wanted to know about was Lucimar. ﻿If Lucimar was there, if she was going to play with me. ﻿My mom said that even before I could talk properly. ﻿I would call Ushimar, Where's Ushimar' ﻿And I'd cry when she left. ﻿She's three or four years older than me and we played loads. ﻿I never imagined that she would come and work for us. ﻿When you were one, our housemaid asked to leave. ﻿Maria Clara was three and you were one. ﻿I was desperate about what to do. ﻿My grandmother remembered that Lucimar. ﻿who had been working for my great aunt, was without work. ﻿My grandmother asked if I wanted Lucimar to work for us. ﻿And I said "Of Course"! ﻿At first it was difficult ﻿because I had to assert myself as the boss. ﻿And this was Lucimar, my childhood best friend. ﻿Proof of my love. ﻿This should never fall into the wrong hands. ﻿- Now I am all yours. - And you are all mine. ♪ How many roads must a man walk down ♪ ♪ Before you can call him a man? ♪ ♪ Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail ♪ ♪ Before she sleeps in the sand? ♪ ♪ Yes, and how many times must cannonballs fly ♪ ♪ Before they're forever banned? ♪ ♪ The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind ♪ ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind ♪ ♪ Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist ♪ ♪ Before it is washed to the sea? ♪ ♪ Yes, and how many years can some people exist ♪ ♪ Before they're allowed to be free? ♪ ♪ The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind ♪ ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind ♪ ♪ The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind ♪ ♪ The answer is blowin' in the wind ♪ ﻿How old were you when you started working? ﻿Fourteen. ﻿Fourteen years old. ﻿What did you do? ﻿Clean and tidy. ﻿Iron clothes. ﻿And then I learnt to cook. ﻿So I could do all the housework. ﻿And what is it that you do best? ﻿Cook.
