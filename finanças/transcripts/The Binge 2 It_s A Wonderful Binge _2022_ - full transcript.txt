♪ Cheery festive music playing ♪ 'Twas the night before Christmas, and I've got a tale to tell. In the very near future, things have all gone to hell. In 2027, it was made illegal to take drugs or to drink. A puff, sniff, or sip will land you straight in the clink. Except for one night, The Binge, as it's known, where it's perfectly legal to get drunk, high, or stoned. But something else happened that no one could anticipate. Spending Christmas with family sober would make you irate. So this year they did what you wouldn't believe. They brilliantly moved The Binge to Christmas Eve. So grab some mistletoe, kids, and prepare to get hyped. A Merry Bingemas to all, and may you all suck it down pipe! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our holiday blowout!

Andrew, I've been meaning to tell you something. Oh, look, they're selling those Special Binge Advent calendars! I heard they have this explosive ketamine that makes you Freaky Friday with whoever you're with. Full body swap! Andrew, I'm not binging tonight. We don't have to Freaky Friday if you don't want, but come on, man, we gotta binge! I know, bro, but can you keep something between you and me? Absolutely. I'm proposing. - What? Really? - Sarah's the love of my life. And I'm going over to her dad's house today to ask him for permission. My boy's getting married! Shh. Andrew. Keep that on the low, all right? Sorry. I just can't contain myself. - I'm getting married. - Getting married. - I'm getting married. - Look at you, man. My sweet baby boy, all grown up! By the way, you and Kimmi are next. Okay. ♪ 'Cause the only thing that matters ♪ ♪ Is we get so fucking high ♪ ♪ I'm gonna get so fucking high ♪ And so another Christmas comes to pass and we all snuggle around the fire with our loved ones. May our smiles be wide, and our hearts be full, and our mi... My God! Sorry, Mayor. I was saving it for The Binge later. It slipped outta my pocket. - Come here. - Okay. Stop the work, please. Hold the work, please! I must be confused. By my calculations, The Binge doesn't start for seven hours. You do understand that the punishment for having an open bottle before The Binge begins is up to 25 years in prison, yes? Ma'am, please. I have a family. Mm-hmm. And it's Christmas. See what else he has. My pleasure. - Ouch. - Drugs. Will you looky there? This is my town, and I am not going to stand by and let a time-honored event like Winter Wonderland be destroyed because you all wanna do a bunch of slamballs out of Frosty's hole! Frosty's hole? F-F-F-F-F-Frosty's hole? Did I stutter? Just now when you were mocking me or previously? Shoot that man. In his face. I can't do that. Two in the kneecaps then. Make it quick. They don't even give me a gun. Oh, my God! You're making me feel like maybe I'm the crazy one! Arrest him! You're under arrest. Your mom is truly terrifying. Yeah, she's in the middle of a nervous breakdown or something. Does anybody else wanna binge? Where are we binging tonight? Chili's? Whackadoodles? I heard Bed, Bath & Beyond is doing something in the Beyond area. Aren't we past all that binge stuff? It's a little immature. Can... Can you follow the snow path? It's a... It's a valley. It has... It has to flow a certain way. Are you serious right now? Anyway, I kinda have to be here to help my mom. What is she doing with that owl? She wants it to be like a Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil thing that brings people into town. I hate that so much. It's me and you, kid, bringing back Christmas. Can't binge on an empty stomach. Let's plop something on. - I'm not doing that. - Just plop it. Stop telling me to plop it. Plop it. - Hey, hey! - What up, bro? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, bro. I got you something, man. What's that? Is that for me? - That's for you, man. - Get the fuck outta here! Put it on. Put it on. "Best Brother Ever!" Hey, Dakota, this is for you. There was a two-fer. I hate you so much. Babe, we talked about this. What did we say about being nicer to my brother? I can't! Look at him. Look at all that up there. And all that in the middle part. - My face and my body? - Yeah. - Just be nice to him. - No. I thought I heard someone come in, and you must be Andrew. Wait, who the fuck is this? Andrew, I'm Craig, your mom's new lover. You're... banging my mom? Your mother and I are intimate together, yes. And we have a very special relationship. And, Andrew, I don't think you should be threatened at all by me or my relationship with your mother. Are you kidding me with this fucking guy? What the hell is going on? I am so excited to be spending the holiday with you and your family. Get the fuck outta here! I love a family that goofs around. I'm into it. I'm not so sure you're gonna like Christmas with us. Can you guys shut the fuck up, please? Andrew, what the hell took you so long to get home? I was getting presents, Mom! What the fuck? The only present I ever got was the human papillomavirus from a retired jockey in Ronkonkoma! Nobody wants to hear your fucking stories! Actually, I kind of do. Will you shut the fuck up, Craig? Don't you tell my Craig to shut up! I will burn this house to the ground and make it look like a fucking accident! You're upsetting Craig with all the yelling! He is a very sensitive man! I apologize. I apologize all around. Don't apologize! How many times have I told you? I'm not sorry for anything. - You're not sorry? - You're not sorry for anything? Are you fucking kidding me? Are you crazy? What kind of person are you? I'm indifferent. I'm just Indifferent Craig. Indifferent Craig, fix this! Oh, I'll put a cinnamon glaze on it. ♪ Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major playing ♪ Mr. Martin! Good to see you, sir. Nice of you to dress up, Hags. Uh, w... what are you working on? Ah, it's a little thing I've been working on for the past two years. Wow, sir! You have quite the talent. Yeah. I mean, this is basically a flawless gingerbread man. - It's a self-portrait. - Really? What an amazing piece. - Thank you. Next up, can you sculpt me like one of your French girls? You know, like in Titanic. The shipwreck in 1912 that killed 1,500 innocent people? That Titanic? I meant the movie. You know as well as I do, movies are just pictures with sound. Uh, well, I'm happy you're out here 'cause I wanted to talk to you about something. You know, um, Sarah and I have been dating each other for about three and a half years now. - You're a good kid, Hags. I know it's been hard holding off being intimate with my daughter. Yeah, right. Yeah, right! Yeah... Yeah, we're waiting until marriage. We might even wait a couple years after marriage. We could just love each other from a distance. But since you brought up marriage though, uh, I wanted to ask you, Mr. Martin... Oh, no, please. Mr. Martin was my father. I'm Dr. Martin. One of the first things I learned in medical school is how to cut through the bone cleanly and swiftly. You're a foot doctor. Feet have bones, Hags! That's the second thing I learned in medical school. Let me show you. Please don't. Hags hasn't been Hags lately. He's been acting, like, super weird. Has Andrew said anything about him? Andrew and I had a conscious uncoupling. How is this the first time I'm hearing about this? Well, we haven't really talked since I've been away at college. And to be honest, as insufferable as my mom is, she did offer to give me a job. And she thinks that Andrew could ruin her image, mainly his two dads. So what? Literally, everyone's parents are gay now. If anything, I think that'll help her win the election. No, like, he literally has two dads. He's a twin from two separate fathers. It's... It's actually pretty common. His mom had sex with two men in a short window of time who got her pregnant at the same time. Like a Rube Goldberg system of having sex... - Gross. - ...where the egg gets knocked into one or another, and then you get two for the price of one, even if... Eyyy! Is that Andrew I hear? Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas, Dad. Dad? Did someone say my name? No, nobody said your name. If I remember correctly, it's almost time for me and your brother to make you eat all the tinsel off the Christmas tree. I... I haven't... I haven't eaten all the tinsel from the Christmas tree in... in years. Well, I think it's always sad to see a tradition die. But The Binge starts in two hours, and I'm gonna get ass up on this motherfuckin' dale, dale! Whipping up a batch of my world-famous nog. Hopefully, Hector doesn't puke on the pussycat again. You know that cat ran away. See what you did, Hector? You know I have a lactose intolerance, Rigo. Oh, yeah. Hector, that excuse ain't gonna fly on The Binge. Tonight, all the rules are out the window! That's not really how irritable bowel syndrome works. Well, then I guess you're gonna shit your pants at the dinner table. I guess I am. Oh. My. God. Kimberly! Kimberly, come. Hurry up. Okay, ladies. Ears open, mouths closed, eyes wide. What should we do with our noses? Flared and proud, Sarah. That owl is freaking me out. What does an owl even have to do with Christmas anyway? I've got a hunch a similar thing was said about bunnies and Easter, but we all collectively seem to have moved past it. Have we not? - I guess. - You guessed right! And do not play games with me, not tonight, because I am not Hasbro, and this ain't Monopoly. You will be Sorry and in Trouble if you mess with my Operation. She loves board games. It's, like, her only frame of reference. - I'm getting that. Girls, it is only one short month away from the election, and we need to remind this town of who they are. Our brand is family values. Now I've already confiscated drugs from the disgusting help that works here. And Channel 7 will be doing a redemption piece on me. The Mayor who defied all odds. The Mayor who brought down The Binge, and brought Christmas and tourism back with the magical help of the Christmas Owl. Shh, shh, shh, shh! Nobody move. Nobody move. If I call it, it will come to me. Someone get it! Get the owl! - I'm not getting him! He looked at me like he had something to prove. Shoot this man! Again, I... I can't. - Shit! Kimmi. - Yes. You have your first task as not my daughter but as my employee. I need that owl back 'cause it really is the cornerstone of this entire event. Do you understand? Go get me my Christmas Owl! ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ Indoor hot tub, Hags. Just had it installed. It's absolutely crucial when the body temperature drops under 32 like yours did. Um, whose bathing suit am I in? I popped you into one of mine. So, uh, you wanna turn on the bubbles or nothing? No, no. I like to be able to see right through to the bottom. Too many mysteries in those bubbles. So I think you were gonna ask me if you could marry my daughter. Yes! No, that's exactly right! I mean, if... if I have your blessing, if that's all right with you. And her. Is she okay? Yeah. That's Grandma Ray. She has nocturnal lagophthalmos. She sleeps with her eyes open. She always has. Right. You know, Sarah's all I got. I was adopted just like her, and my mother before me. It's part of our family ethos to bring together love from all different walks of life. And that all culminates on Christmas. Man, that is beautiful. Night terrors. Just ignore it, she's fine. Okay. I... I mean, sir, you know, Sarah and I are really just... Don't stare at her, please. Sir, if she's asleep, how will she know? Do you wanna marry Sarah, or do you want to talk about Grandma Ray? That's exactly... I would love to marry your daughter. Mm-hmm. I know Sarah and I are both a little stuck in our ways, but I... I... I'm starting to notice our friends move on to the next phases of their lives, and... I think we're ready to do that too. Uh... You know what? No. I know we are. ♪ Soft poignant music playing ♪ Mom, wake up! I think it's time to tell him the story of the family ring. Yes. ♪ Soft ethereal music playing ♪ A jeweled kaleidoscope of different eras, cultures, and love sagas, originally etched by my great-great-grandfather who was the bastard child of a wild-eyed blacksmith and a legless courtesan during the Ottoman Empire. Formed from the hottest lava in the hills of Ganesh. There was a tradition that every time the ring was passed down, a stone would be added. Well, she eventually added a ruby and passed it down to her daughter, my great-grandmother, who was the first woman soldier to fight in the Zaraniq Rebellion. The ring was quickly lost in a hail of gunpowder and smoke. She buried the ring in her baby daughter's blanket and ran back into the war zone, ready to die! This is important. Don't miss this next five minutes. That baby was raised by zebras in what was then British East Africa and grew up to be my grandmother who was eventually adopted by a nice East Coast family. Thus began the long line of adoptions. Well, she went on to marry a longshoreman in Northern New Jersey with gout of the hands. Fearful that the ring will be taken from her, she hid it in the body of a six-foot rainbow trout that her husband had brought home the morning before he went missing. That ring stayed in the carcass of that frozen fish for nearly four years, and now, I bestow it to you. The legend... unbelievable. The smell... intolerable. And now it's yours to make your own story with. Here, catch. Uh-oh. Right there. - Got it. - Good. Yeah, I see why you keep the bubbles off now. Now you're starting to get it, Hags. Yes, sir. You know, that was an amazing story... Uh... don't even bother. She's conked out. Welcome to the family, son. Oh, thank you, sir. Ew! What the fuck is happening here? Why are you guys in the hot tub? Um, Sarah, I can explain. I'm just bonding time... Hags, keep your voice down. My grandma's sleeping. Okay, babe, can you just grab me a towel? No! Don't waste the towel. Wipe yourself off on the carpet. That's what it's there for. Do not roll around on my carpet. This is my house. Roll around on the carpet, please. Stop carpet drying! Roll around.

And can you be 100% honest with me? Of course. Absolutely. Did you break out of jail and steal that squad car? No, that's my Uber. Yeah, you got five stars, Rick! All right, yeah, I stole the car, okay? But it doesn't matter because The Binge is on, and everyone's excited about Christmas again! Uncle Kris, I really think I should take you back to jail. You're gonna be in so much trouble, and... and my mom is gonna kill us. I'll go back to jail in the morning, I promise. But tonight, it's about family, all right? And now we gotta fix this old leg of mine. - All right? I need your help, okay? - Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, just treat it like a gear shift. Like a Miata. All right, go for it.

We are reporting live from outside of Winter Wonderland which is set to open in just a few hours. The trains are running, children are playing, but terror lurks. That's right, the reports of owl attacks have been on the rise. Many are blaming Mayor Spengler for releasing a bloodthirsty owl into town. Residents, we are advising all of you to duck and take cover if you hear any sort of odd rustling sounds. And pet owners, make sure to lock away any scoopable pets. It's for their safety and yours. This thing is amazing! You open the first box when The Binge starts and then one every hour till it's over. We're gonna be so fucked. So, babe, what are you thinking I should wear for dinner tonight? Should I do a traditional button-down or... wait a minute, something a bit more flashy? Who cares? You don't see me stressing about my wardrobe. Well, that's 'cause you'll look stunning in anything you decide to wear. All right, what the hell is wrong with you? - Huh? - Everyone is acting so bizarre. You're planning your Christmas outfits. My dad's tubbing with you. Kimmi gets back home from college and wants to be called Kimberly. Well, you know, maybe we're all just growing up. - Oh, I know what you're doing. - You do? I actually have a little Christmas surprise for you. I was gonna wait till later tonight, but... Oh, babe! Thank you! I can't wait... Oh! Oh, look at this! This is... What is this? It's a sex vest. It's called the Titilator. You said you wanted to spice things up. When did I say that? I like the current spice level of our relationship. Well I paid $3.99 for the app, so put it on. App? Woo!

What if he hears us? He won't hear anything. I'll just put on some fuck music. What kind of music? Alexa, play fuck music. Why are you saying that so loud? Now playing Sarah's fuck music playlist. Hmph. I'm glad to see funk is making a comeback with the kids. Since when are you so worried about my dad? He's not gonna come in. Do you want me to come in? - No! - No! Alexa, turn up the Titilator to level seven. Titilator, level seven. Okay, Alexa, stop. This is bad. Oh-oh-oh-oh, this is bad. Calling Dad. Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! Sarah, what are those haunted noises? Are you guys playing with the Ouija board again? Sarah, Sarah, please. I can't take anymore, and your dad's outside. And what if Santa flies by and he sees my penis?

I paid child support for 18 years, and I want my money back. Hector's obviously his father, two sad sacks that are afraid of milk. We're not afraid of milk. Our bodies reject it. No, you're afraid.

Hags, I got you that sweater for your birthday. It was not meant to be worn for ugly party purposes. Oh! Girl, I know that. - Take it off. - What now? Take it off if you think it's so ugly! I... I don't think I should. My family's waiting! - I'm sorry. - All right. Wow. What? Put the sweater back on, Hags, and sit down. Sorry, I'm tardy. Leather vest, it's just an inside joke we have. - Isn't that right, honey? - Oh, really? Vest got stuck. Why is that funny? Oh, I don't think you'd find it funny, sir. I have a sense of humor. What's the joke? Um, well, you know, so many animals had to die in order to make something leather like this, and it's just so sad. Okay, sad is funny. I mean, structurally it works, but the punchline is ambiguous at the very best. Fern, Ron, do you find it funny? Not funny. Well, okay, I see the kids get it. That must be a generational thing. No, Hags, they're simply sensing the tension in the room and laughing out of discomfort. Grandma's just sleepwalking. I still don't know when that's happening. Don't be scared, kids.

What happened to the presents? ♪ Unsettling music playing ♪ Who gives a fuck about presents... No, no, there was Christmas presents under the tree. What happened to 'em? This isn't the time to be thinking about presents. Where'd they go? Haven't you heard a word that I've said? For us, the gift is family. Every year, we give all of our gifts to the orphanage. It's the least we can give to them after all they've given to us. Okay. Sarah, honey, I gotta go. - What? - But I'll be right back. Where the hell are you going? I told Andrew that I would stop by and see him and... and see his family. I promised him I'll be there. - You hate Andrew's family. - Kind of, yes, honey. But I really need to go. - On Christmas Eve?

What? We watched it every Christmas, remember? This is where I learned to steal a cop car. Oh, that's super cool, Uncle Kris. But I really need to find this stupid fucking Christmas Owl or my mom will actually murder me. Oh, I was thinking. We should go to the Winter Wonderland. That's a really great idea, but it actually isn't because you shouldn't be in public. The cops are gonna see you. That's the beauty of tonight. Because everyone's dressed like me, so I'll blend right in. Hey, Kimmi, come here, will ya? Got you something. Oh, Uncle Kris. I didn't really get you anything. Merry Christmas. I had it taped to the wall of my cell right next to my bed, and, um, I was remembering when your dad passed away how hard it was on the family. And how your mom, you know, she just kind of threw herself into her work and kind of at the expense of your upbringing. So I just... I don't know, I always kind of saw myself as kind of a de facto dad, you know, even though I, you know, I'm not the normal uncle or whatever. But I just wanted you to know that I love you very much. And I'm really happy to be with you on Christmas. And I, you know, I just wish everything could go back to the way it used to be, you know? I don't think that's possible, Uncle Kris. No, no, no. It is! It is. I'm telling you! You know, everything's gonna be totally normal from here on out. Fuck! That's the cops. It's the cops. Okay. You haven't seen me. You haven't seen me at all... Oh, no. You've seen me, but I was far away. Just say that. Okay. That motherfucker is cheating on me! I know it! - Who, Hags? No. - Obviously! He wouldn't cheat on you. He is so, so, so scared of you, and... Kimmi, is that your weird uncle hiding behind the Christmas tree? Oh, hey! Yeah. Merry Christmas. You look good, look festive. You seem happy. How's your dad? Uh, you know, staying out of jail. No way! It's hard to do. Trust me. So anyway, I'm gonna go put some stuff on the sleigh. Christmas is right around the corner! Uh, anyway, you guys go back to your girl problem. Let me just say from the bottom of my heart, Sarah, I'm so glad you're not the DEA. Seriously. - Right. Me too. - Yeah. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Yeah, he used to dress like Santa every Christmas, but somewhere down the road, it became full-time. Some people are so crazy. Anyway, I have a tracker on Hags' phone and iPad. I pinged all the cell towers at every location he's been to today, cross-referenced it with the location of his laptop, which I also have bugged, so triangulation should be fairly straightforward. We need to follow him and see where he's going. Yeah, that's totally normal and healthy and not at all psychotic, but, um, I can't. Uh, I have to be at Winter Wonderland at 09:00, and I still need to find this stupid fucking Christmas Owl. Otherwise, my mom... - Oh, my God! There has to be something in here that'll loosen you up. I don't need to be loosened! I'm not binging! We actually are a very upstanding family, okay? Okay! Ladies, ladies. Hey, everything's totally fine. You know what? It's more than fine. Merry Christmas! It's just... The neighbors, I think, recognized me and called the cops while I was decorating my sleigh. The squad car he stole. Right. Look, again, everything's totally fine. We just probably wanna leave within the next two or three minutes, or there's gonna be a lot of angry banter over a megaphone and, uh, I dunno, possible gunfire. Maybe. I don't know.

I'm warm on my inside and cold in my toes and fingers! - That's crazy. - So please, can you come get me? Only thing is I'm not here. Oh, you... you sick, twisted motherfucker, man!

I never delivered presents to you 'cause you were Jewish, but your neighbors, Barbara and Henry, they had a daughter named Patty, and the family owned a bakery, and they would leave me really good cookies. Yeah, they were a really nice family. We'll be outta here, guys. Don't worry. I didn't tell him any of those things. If this motherfucker is really Santa, that's on you. Love you, Santa. So you're just not gonna talk to me now? - You hung up on me, man. - I called you back. - You did? - Yes! Oh, okay, 'cause I was in a dark place, okay?

Everyone should. - What a loser. - Find friends. I have no respect for people who have no long-term relationships. Sure no one will notice us here? There's no way they could. Here's the plan. I'm gonna be responsible for sneaking the guys out. That means all you have to do is hack into the mainframe and shut down the cameras, the security system, and the locking mechanism to the cell. From there, you're gonna shadow ban yourself on the dark web. - You're gonna be completely incognito. - All right. Then you're gonna go in, reroute all the calls in the local area 40 miles east, sending the squad cars away. - Mainframe. - Yeah. Squad cars away. Wait, you want me to do this? Yeah, we don't have a full eleven, so I allocated all the tech stuff to you. Well, I don't know how to do any of the stuff you just said.
