[sirens blaring] - [motivational speaker] Congratulations. You've demonstrated your desire to succeed by making it to disc five in my series, "making it big the dockery way." Let's get started. Success in business relies on strict adherence to a simple maxim: never sell anyone what they need, sell them what they want. Sales begin with the self. Sell yourself first to each client, that client will buy whatever product you have. Your product: would you buy it? Your service: would you use it? If the answer is no, then your clients will feel the same way. Don't quit. U.s. Grant was a drunken failure at every turn until the civil war. Then he became president. Abraham lincoln went broke five times. In the words of winston spencer churchill: "never give up. Never, never, never give up." Self-doubt is self-defeat. Prospective buyers will be drawn to your self-confidence. If they sense doubt in you, they will look elsewhere. - CAESAR. I FORGIVE YOU. - ...read that best-seller you heard about. [can clinking] - no one is even discussing it. Well-rounded and personable trumps narrow and boring every time. Do you like money? Who doesn't. [clicks off] - GOOD. GOOD. BE A GOOD DOG, CAESAR. [patting] ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A GOOD DOG. STAY. [door closes] [dog whimpers] [dings] - AH... DYNAMITE SUIT, PHILIP. - YOU LIKE? IT'S AN OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED DKNY. - ACTUALLY, IT'S ARMANI. - DO YOU THINK WE COULD SKIP TO THE PART WHERE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FOUR MONTHS WE DATED WERE JUST A BIG WASTE OF TIME? - NO. [clicks] I HATE THAT PART. - SO YOU WANT TO GRAB A PIZZA TONIGHT? I COULD MAYBE PICK UP A MOVIE? - I-- I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT I REALLY DO HAVE TO WORK LATE. - WHAT? IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT. - WHAT CAN I SAY? YOU'RE RIGHT. I DO WORK TOO HARD. OH, AND BY THE WAY, IT WAS MORE LIKE FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. [traffic sounds] - RENEE, I GOT IT. [chattering] - [sighs] [sighs] - WOW, PHILIP. THOSE ARE SUPER. - DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING? - YOU KNOW, I'D SAY THAT YOU COULD DO THOSE FASTER ON A COMPUTER, BUT WHAT THE HECK DO I KNOW? I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LEFT EARLY LAST NIGHT. - I WAS HERE UNTIL 10:00, AND THEN I WENT HOME AND I WORKED UNTIL MIDNIGHT. - MIDNIGHT. MIDNIGHT, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S ABOUT WHEN J.D. STROLLED INTO MY OFFICE. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WE WERE KICKING AROUND IDEAS. NOW, HE'S ALL FIRED UP. - WHAT DID HE SAY? - OH...OH, DEAR. [laughs] - HEY, DID-- DID HE ALREADY DECIDE TO PRESENT YOUR IDEA? AM I WASTING MY TIME HERE? - [laughing] J.D. [laughing] - [sighs] J.D., HERE'S A CONCEPT THAT I CAME UP WITH LAST NIGHT AFTER I LEFT WORK, WHICH WAS AROUND 10:00. YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS MORE LIKE 10:30. - PHILIP, HAVE A SEAT. - SURE. [clears throat] - GENTLEMEN, THE BIG PITCH IS UPON US. YOUR FIRST MEETING WITH COWBOY BOB WILL TAKE PLACE NEXT WEDNESDAY AT THE FOCUS GROUP. THAT MEANS YOU HAVE LESS THAN ONE WEEK. IF WE LAND COWBOY BOB'S TACOS, I'M GOING TO NEED SOMEONE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, TAKE THE RESTAURANT WORLDWIDE. IF IT WERE UP TO ME, YOU'D BOTH BE PROMOTED TO CREATIVE DIRECTOR. BUT THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE OF YOU UP TOP. MANY OF YOUR CO-WORKERS' JOBS ARE DEPENDING ON THIS ACCOUNT. LOU, YOU'LL PITCH YOUR IDEAS NEXT FRIDAY. AND, PHILIP, YOU'LL HAVE YOUR SHOT THE FOLLOWING MONDAY. GOOD LUCK, GENTLEMEN, MAKE ME PROUD. - A MAN IN A COWBOY HAT WHO SMELLS LIKE CHICKEN IS HERE TO SEE YOU, SIR. - THANK YOU, MS. HUFFRED. IT'S THE CLIENT. OFFER HIM SOME COFFEE, SHOW HIM INTO THE MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. [traffic whooshing] [knocking] [sighs] - PHILIP. AH! I KNEW YOU'D BE HOME ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. ALWAYS WORKING, ALWAYS A GO-GETTER. - [laughs nervously] - I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. OTHERWISE, I'D HAVE TO BRING ZACH, AND HE HATES CROWDS. - W--WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE SAN DIEGO INSTITUTE OF ART. THEY WANT TO SHOW MY WORK. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT! AND I HAVE A BIG, BIG, BIG FAVOR I NEED REPAID. - NO, NO, NO FAVORS. I'M REALLY VERY BUSY RIGHT-- - THE CORNERS OF THIS TABLE ARE AS SHARP AS NAILS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE HERE FOR FOOD? - AN OLD WHEEL OF BRIE? - I'D KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ANYTHING BREAKABLE NEAR THE FRONT DOOR. - WHY? [glass shatters] HI, ZACH. - DON'T WORRY, HONEY. THE GRAVITY IS VERY GOOD IN HERE-- I CHECKED. - GRAVITY? - IT'S ONLY FOR THE WEEKEND. AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT TIME TOGETHER. - WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO. NO. NOT OKAY. NO. NO. I'VE GOT A BIG PRESENTATION I'M PREPARING FOR. - OH, COME ON, LITTLE BROTHER. YOU AND ZACH ARE TWO PEAS IN A POD. HOW MANY FAVORS HAVE I DONE FOR YOU? - ONE? OR TWO, A COUPLE. - TRUST ME. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING. NOW... [dog growls] I'M GOING TO CALL YOU TOMORROW. - NO, WHY ME? - YOU'RE HIS UNCLE! IT'S ABOUT TIME THE TWO OF YOU SPENT SOME TIME TOGETHER. - [sighs] NO, I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF A KID LIKE ZACH. I MEAN, HE'S-- HE'S, YOU KNOW. - HE'S EIGHT. YOU WERE EIGHT ONCE TOO, REMEMBER? DON'T YOU THINK I FEEL BAD ABOUT LEAVING HIM HERE? - [laughs] - YOU'LL BE FINE. NOW, YOU TWO HAVE A GOOD TIME TOGETHER. OKAY, I LOVE YOU BOTH. YOU'LL BE FINE, TOO. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. - JILL-- - HE'S HUNGRY. BYE! - WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR DINNER? I'LL HAVE THE SALMON WELL-DONE, NOT TOO CRISPY. THREE LEMON WEDGES ON THE SIDE AND SAUCE ON THE SIDE. - AND FOR YOU? - UH, CHEESEBURGER AND FRENCH FRIES FOR THE LITTLE GUY. THANK YOU. COME ON. WHAT KID DOESN'T LOVE FRENCH FRIES?

YOU THINK WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE WEEKEND? [laughs] [dog whimpering] [traffic sounds] [alarm beeping] - THE CEO OF A MAJOR CORPORATION TOLD ME ONCE THAT HE NEVER INTENDED TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND WENT SO FAR AS TO TELL HIS ASSISTANT TO NEVER PUT MY CALLS THROUGH. I PHONED TWICE A WEEK FOR SIX MONTHS. ONE DAY HE RELENTED AND GAVE ME THREE MINUTES. - [groans] - IN LESS THAN TWO, I HAD A MEETING... [shuts off] - NOW, I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU, BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO WATCH. DON'T TOUCH THIS, NOW. [dog whimpering] OKAY, THE GRAVITY IS GOOD IN HERE. BUT WE HAVE TO CHECK EVERY DAY. OTHERWISE, WE'LL FALL OFF THE EARTH AND INTO THE SKY AND FLOAT AWAY WITH THE AIRPLANES INTO THE WILD BLUE YONDER. [laughs] AND WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF US THEN? - GOOD MORNING. WHAT ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR? DON'T SAY PIZZA. - CEREAL. - WELL, THAT I CAN MAKE. YOU WANT TO HELP? HEY, ZACH, LISTEN-- I HAVE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO TODAY, ALL RIGHT?

DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD WATCH HIM FOR ME TODAY? I'LL PAY YOU. - I CAN WATCH HIM UNTIL 1:00. - THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - NOW, LET'S SEE. HOW AM I GOING TO WATCH YOU AND WALK MY CLIENTS AT THE SAME TIME? [dog whimpers] [barking] OH GOOD, ZACH! YOU'RE GOOD WITH DOGS! WAIT! COME ON! THERE YOU GO. [cat meowing] STAY! PLEASE! [cat meowing angrily] - HEY, GET HIM! COME ON, GUYS! COME ON! - OKAY. [dogs barking] HEY, GET HIM! [distant dogs barking] BYE! - [groans] - CATS CAN CLIMB TREES! - WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S GOING ON? I THOUGHT THAT BERNADETTE WAS WATCHING YOU UNTIL 1:00? - THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT! - I CAN'T WATCH YOU RIGHT NOW. I'VE GOT WORK TO DO. - MOM SAID YOU'D TAKE ME TO THE AIRPORT TO WATCH THE PLANES TODAY. - AIRPORT, NO. I CANNOT TAKE YOU TO THE-- - WHERE'S MY MOM? - SHE'S AT HER ART SHOW, AND SHE'S GOING TO BE BACK ON-- - I'M BORED. - JEEZ. YESTERDAY I COULDN'T GET YOU TO SAY A WORD.

I FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. - IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. - HOW'S ZACH? - UM, HE DOESN'T KNOW YET. - YOU'RE AWARE THAT ZACH HAS A LEARNING DISABILITY, RIGHT? IT SAYS HERE HE WAS EXAMINED AT AGE THREE. I KNOW THAT JILL ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT HE WAS MISDIAGNOSED. - HMM. I JUST THINK SHE HAD A HARD TIME ACCEPTING IT. - WHAT SHE WAS MOST CONCERNED WITH WAS THE CONSEQUENCES OF ZACH BEING LABELED. - WHAT KIND OF CONSEQUENCES? - ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. THE BOY MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A SPECIAL SCHOOL, TAKE CERTAIN MEDICATIONS. IT COULD HAVE FAR-REACHING EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY IF HE WAS MISDIAGNOSED. - [sighs] - [making airplane noises] - SO WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM NOW? - HE'LL GO TO HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN. - OH, HIS ONLY LIVING RELATIVE IS HIS AUNT ROSE IN FRESNO. - ROSE ISN'T WHO JILL HAD IN MIND. - WHO ELSE IS THERE? - ME? NO, LISTEN. I THINK THAT ROSE WOULD BE BETTER. SHE'S-- SHE'S GOT KIDS. SHE LIVES IN THE COUNTRY. I REALLY THINK ZACH WOULD BE BETTER WITH ROSE. [cell phone ringing] I... [beeps] LISTEN, I-- I COULDN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF HIM FOR ONE WEEKEND. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THIS? - YOU LEARN. PHILIP, YOU CAN DO THIS. JILL WOULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN YOU IF SHE DIDN'T HAVE FAITH IN YOU. - THIS IS YOUR HOME, RIGHT? - ROGER THAT. [birds tweeting] [wind chimes tinkling] - HI, HERBERT.

I CAN'T-- I CAN'T-- [tumbling] I CAN'T DO THIS, OKAY. I AM NOT EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH HIM. - PHILIP, ACCIDENTS HAPPEN, OKAY? HE'S JUST A KID. [dog growling] MY COUSIN ROSE THINKS THAT I SHOULD ENROLL HIM IN A SCHOOL FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY-CHALLENGED. - YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU COULD GET HIM RE-TESTED. AT LEAST THEN YOU'LL KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC ISSUES YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH. - [groans] SHE THINKS HE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH HER IN FRESNO. - FRESNO? - YEAH. THERE'S SOME KIND OF A SPECIAL SCHOOL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. - HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO LIVE IN FRESNO. THERE ARE TRAINED EXPERTS RIGHT HERE WHO CAN HELP YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM. - I DON'T KNOW.
