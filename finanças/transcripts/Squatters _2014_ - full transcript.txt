All right. I like you more and more. Thanks. When did you have your first cigar? When? I was 31. I was hanging out with some guys who liked to smoke. It wasn't the taste and it wasn't the smoke. It was the idea, you know? That that's what they did at the top. And that's what I wanted. I wanted to be right at the top. Looks like you made it. Almost. Almost, kiddo. [♪] EVELYN: Come, come. [SIGHS] Wow, look at that. Yeah, look at that. [CHUCKLES] You know the drill. We record everything. Everything. Everything. That's great. It's been a while. It's a good occasion. It's a great occasion. And it's great to have you with us. Thank you. All right, well, let's get to the Hebrew, the lamb shank, wicked child, all that stuff. No, we can skip all that tonight. Let's just make this about the family and the love that's at this table. And I guarantee you, in 20 years, you'll understand how important that is. Come on, Dad. It's okay. A lot of people don't have this. You have a beautiful family and it's great to be part of it tonight. Thank you. Wow. Okay, Michael, why don't you go to the door and invite Elijah in? EVELYN: Elijah is a prophet. He represents everyone who is in need and is always welcome. Yeah, and he looks like Superman with a big star on his chest. [LAUGHS] Come on. All right. It's been too long. [DOOR CLOSES] JONAS: Go in there. [♪] Mike? [EVELYN GASPS] EVELYN: Please, don't. Sit down. You shut up. I'm not who you were expecting, huh? Please don't point my gun at anyone. Please. Your gun? This isn't your gun anymore, okay? I'm so sorry to interrupt dinner, all of you looking so... So presentable. But, you know, from the outside, you never see the whole truth. Please, you can have anything you want. Hey, take it easy. How about instead I pull this trigger? Jonas. Jonas, you win, okay? This has nothing to do with you. You're full of shit. Do you know this person? Yeah. Yeah. [KELLY SOBBING] Yeah. It was you? Wait, Michael. It was you two? I'm sorry. You lied to me? Yeah. You lied to me and you set us up. No. JONAS: Yeah, something like that, man. This was all a fucking con? You know what, man? It's called survival. In the real world, it's called survival. Jonas. I don't know what a con is anymore. You are not who you say you are. Don't know what you're talking about. I am so sick of you and your family and your fucking house. Then get the fuck out. No! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sit down. You can have anything you want. Whatever I want? I want your car. Okay. The Porsche. The Carrera. Great. Kelly, now we go. Kelly. Just leave. I'm sorry. Just fucking leave.

Be one of them, be nice and pretty and rich? Well, you're not. You are shit, Kelly. You're trash, like me. The question is, what the fuck you're gonna do now, huh, after I've made the deal and I'm sitting pretty in Mexico, off the grid and you're up here running from cops? Because they'll never let you go. That's how it works in this world. Here. Sammy, check it out. You got a bathroom? It's a fucking house, we have the whole jamboree-- Don't need bathroom, we're leaving. Fuck you. I need to take a piss. Oh-ho-ho, firecracker. Is she negotiable too? No, she's not. She's with me. I'm not with you. My price is fixed, it's too high for Jonas. Do you think I can afford you? You think I can take a piss? Sure, down the stairs on the left. ♪ To the left, to the left What a cunty little minx she is. [♪] [LINE RINGING] OPERATOR [OVER PHONE]: 911, what's your emergency?

Let's go. I thought about it. And I want a new daddy. I want him to keep me safe and warm at night. Nice ring. Oh, yes, thank you. That's me, Ronald Smythe, at your service. JONAS: Kelly, what the fuck are you doing? She's getting me fucking hard, that's what she's doing. Very cute. Now, hand it back. It's not your ring. Excuse me? Were you not listen-- You're a liar. Don't pull this shit. So are you. Give back the ring. RONALD: If I were you, I'd listen to your friend. Spit the ring out. No? Okay. Hey, come on, she'll give it back. Give it back to me. Come on, now. Let's have it. Come on. Spit it out. Spit my fucking ring out or you will be spitting fucking blood. Spit it out! [SLAP LANDS] Spit it out. Give it to Daddy.

Mr. Silverman. Well, I am happy to report that we recovered your belongings. Ha, ha. Really? Uh, two cars and looks like a lot of jewelry. How did you manage to do that? Ha, ha. Get this, Bonnie and Clyde had a little bit of a falling out. She ratted him out, called 911 from the bathroom. It was crazy, big shoot-out. But she definitely paid the price. What are you talking about? She's in ICU. MICHAEL: What hospital? What--? The girl, what hospital? County Hospital. Michael. [KEYS JINGLE] ♪ I should have quit But instead ♪ ♪ I took care of you Hi, I'm looking for Kelly, um, Tanner. Kelly Tanner. Thank you so-- Oh, Kelly. Is she gonna be okay? Doctor says she's gonna be fine. Family? No, I'm just a friend. I'm not supposed to allow you in here. Ma'am, please. Please. Haven't seen anybody else coming in. Thank you so much. Thank you. Keep it short. Okay. Oh, Kelly, I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was the only thing she had on her. Wouldn't let go of it for dear life. Not even in her sleep. All right, this is her first ride. You can do it. Yeah, you can stand-- Stephanie, stand. Push down with the right foot. Down with the left. Keep it straight. Look ahead at Mommy.

Good girl, give me five. I'm not holding you. EVELYN: That was so good, sweetie. [CHUCKLES] Kelly. Hi. You look better. Kelly, this is my lawyer. LAWYER: Kelly, hi. Hi. I wanna talk about your confession. What about it? Well, Jonas' father is a very wealthy man, and he wants to help you to pay your medical bills and to offer my counsel in your defense if you need it. Why would he do that? Because you would sign this testimony which states that Ronald Smythe threatened Jonas' life and forced him to rob the Silvermans at gunpoint. That's bullshit. You don't know that for sure, do you? You're such a coward. Miss Tanner. Go fuck yourself. Will you step outside, please? Jonas. Just give us a minute. Just take a walk. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] You remember you asked me one time how I wound up on the street? Yeah. It's because my dad kicked me out. Why? Because we hate each other. One night he took a swing at me after I got the tattoo, and he hit me so fucking hard it landed me in the hospital for a week. Sounds like an asshole. He is. That's why you gotta sign this document and have him pay for your medical bills. [KNUT'S "THE UNWINDING HOURS" PLAYING] I should probably sign it. But I can't. I'm not lying or cheating anymore. I'm telling the fucking truth in court. You're making a mistake. That's what I always do. JUDGE: Jonas Trumball? Fine of $50,000 and 200 hours of community service. I'd say you got off easy, Jonas. Wouldn't you? Thank you, Your Honor. Get out of my courtroom. JUDGE: Kelly Tanner. Yes? Breaking and entering, theft, six months sentence, no parole. Pleaded guilty. Turned yourself in. Do you think you belong here? It's the penalty, isn't it? For breaking the law, for lying, for stealing? Just let me pay it. Okay. See your parole officer on your first day. He or she can lay out the obligations of being on parole. They're easy. Stay out of trouble. I will.
