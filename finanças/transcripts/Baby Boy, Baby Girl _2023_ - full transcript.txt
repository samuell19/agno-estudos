You sure it's for tonight? What time? Call time is 6:30. Please, Josie! The other usherette is sick. The event will be over by 11. And there won't be a lot of guests. - How much? - Two thousand. That's too low. Yes, ma'am, 30 leche flans, ready to deliver by tomorrow! No problem, just text me the shipping address. Sir, can you drive a bit faster, I'm getting late. The two of you at the registration. - Aimee, Noel. - Yes, ma'am. And two by the door. You'll be greeting the guests that need to register, and bring them to their assigned seats. Josie, Danda. Yes, ma'am. Eric and Anjo. You're in charge of the patrol, you guys will attend to the guests' concerns, okay? - Yes ma'am. - Yes ma'am. Let's do this. Come on, guys! Hi, miss. Is this the registration? Oh, yes, hold on. Yes, sir, can I have your name? Well, here's the thing… What's your name? Aimee. Aimee! Such a beautiful name. I'm here on behalf of Ms. Vivian Ongkiko. Ah, Tourism Head! - Yes! - Hello, hello! - Good thing you got here so quickly! - Hello! This one's fine. Ms. Vivian just called. - Seb, right? - Yes! - This way, please. - Alright, thank you! Oh my god! What's up? There was a handsome guest earlier. I can't get over it! Who? I didn't catch his name because Ma'am Carla pulled him away! Didn't you see him? He was in a baby blue suit! Was it baby blue, or powder blue? Ah, whatever, it was light blue! I didn't notice! Ugh, my god! If I didn't have a boyfriend, I'd be all over that! What about you? You got a boyfriend? I'm too busy to have a boyfriend. I'd rather earn money. Ladies and gentlemen, this year's outstanding Tourism Entepreneurs, please give them a round of applause. Unfortunately, Ms. Vivian Ongkiko could not be with us tonight. Here to represent her is last year's winner of the Mr. Tourism Title, in the 12th Ginoong Kamaynilaan… Mr. Sebastian Soliman! Girl, that's the guy I was talking about! The cutie! That's him! He's the one I'm talking about! Thank you so much for the warm welcome. I just want to congratulate all the winners for tonight. Congratulations to everyone. I hope you guys enjoy and have a good night. - Thank you, Mr. Sebastian Soliman. - You think someone that hot is single? Whoever's dating that guy is so lucky. Just because he's handsome? What if he's ugly on the inside? You're being too serious! Don't you think he's handsome? Listen, Ames, men like that will use their charms just to get what they want! And when they make a mistake, they'll turn up their charms again hoping you'll forgive them. If I were you, Ames, look for a man who wants... You look exhausted. Excuse us, guys… Aimee, come here for a sec. Yes, ma'am. The people here are hungry, come on, serve them. How are you? I didn't know that you'd be here also. So... You won a pageant. The cash prize was pretty big. Winning opened up a lot of opportunities, too. I guess you found your lucky break. Congrats. Thanks, thanks. You doing anything after this? I'm busy. Just to clarify things. I have no plans to get back together. I just need a stress-reliever. Did you miss this? What are you looking at? I don't get it. Get what? This! All of this! How you managed to have all this in such a short time! How you can afford all the events you go to, based off your Instagram posts? Just how big was that cash prize? That's kind of insulting. Why? You think I can't achieve something like this? What do you do? You're a high class call boy, aren't you? Wow, you're really… So what is it? What are you up to? Sugar dating. What's that? Sugar dating! A relationship between a sugar baby and a sugar mommy. Or daddy. I give my time, companionship, affection in exchange for money, gifts, support, and other perks. Like? Sponsored trips! All-expenses-paid vacations, VIP access to high-end establishments, among other things. I see... So you are a high-class call boy. Bro, we said no bringing of sponkies home. Sponky? What's a sponky? Josie isn't my sponkie. She's my ex! Ah, an ex! So… you're her sponky then? No, we just ran into each other last night. Ah… you just missed each other! Aw, you missed her! Hey! What the hell is a sponky?! I've been asking! Ah… Hi, ma'am. I'm Binbin, this is Abel… This is Kate. Do you all have the same job? Yes. So you're all hoes? - We're not hoes! - We're not hoes! What the hell? Ouch! Sugar dating and prostitution are different! With sugar dating, you don't sell your body! What you sell is your time! Acting the role of a lover! Companionship! There are people who look for those? Lots, but not all of them can dole out cash for this. Obviously, for us in the sugar dating business, we only cater to those who can pay. Why is this your job then? Were you kicked out of school? Blacklisted from companies? You see Abel? He may look like a bum, but he's a graduate of Computer Engineering! Huh? And then there's Binbin! He looks like a street urchin at first glance, right? But he's an award-winning indie film actor! Not to mention a popular influencer! How many followers do you have on Tiktok? - 1.3 million. - 1.3 million! As for Kate, she's currently doing her Masters. European Languages! She also dubs part-time for anime and Korean dramas. In short, it's our choice to do sugar dating. Not because we were forced to! It's fun! The pay is great! And above all, the transaction is clear: this is what I'm giving, so this is what I get. Not too different from your regular dating or relationship. Actually, sugar dating is better because there are set obligations for both parties. If they can't be met, the end! Move on! No need for toxic drama! That's deep, man. It's all thanks to my damn ex. Ah, whatever! Any questions? And you? Why did you get into this? I'm saving up for something. What about you? Don't you want to try this? You might find an investor for your pillow business... That business is long dead! I'm going home. Hello, ma'am? Yes, I'm booking a rider. They can get there at a quarter to 11... Cancel it. We already bought some earlier. What? Why? We agreed on 11 AM. I'm even sending this early. We already bought some, and cheaper too! Cancel that. You can't do this! I already finished your order! I spent money on this! I said we already bought some, what are we going to do with all that leche flan? Why did you order from others when you already placed an order with me? I'll report you to Tulfo, if you don't pay up! Do what you want! Hello? Hello? Hey, answer me! Hey! Okay… So what name do you want to put here? Does it have to be my real name? Just a username. What about you? What's yours? Charming baby boy. But "I" at the end instead of "y". What, isn't it true? Wasn't that why you liked me before? Even if I was just a janitor? Carabao… baby… girl.. But with 'u' instead of 'i' in "girl". Let me see. Carabao? Really? Are you sure about this? You don't want anything catchier like 'pretty' or 'sexy'? Isn't that why you were attracted to me before? Because I worked like a carabao? Ah, whatever. Here. Just put your photo there later. The site has a list of attributes that you might be looking for, like age, gender, and what you want in a sugar daddy. There's travel, gifts, mentorship, investment, intimacy, or date. Just check what you want. Okay, okay. I'll handle this. Ma'am? Sir Seb is here. Seb, my darling! Hey, Viv! What a pleasant surprise! Thanks for attending on my behalf, by the way! No problem. Besides, I had fun. I'm sure everybody was looking at you... Just remember, Josie… In sugar dating, you control the relationship. You are the prize! This outfit looks great, where did you get this? Remember when we went shopping in Taguig? Have you forgotten? You chose this for me, remember? Obviously, you'll get a lot of rude messages. From maniacs and perverts. Just ignore them if you're uncomfortable. You should stay the night! I'll have the driver bring you home tomorrow. You really want me to sleep in the guest room? Don't you want someone beside you? Nope! No? - Nope! - Are you sure? Just remember that there are a lot of people looking for sugar babies. Someone they can take care of. Someone they can spoil. Seriously. Stay the night. Convince me first. What do you want to buy? What's the budget? Depends if you're sleeping in the guest room, or in my bedroom. What if I sleep in the guest room? Eight thousand. - What about here? - 12 thousand. 20 thousand if you sleep here, without this. 25 thousand if without bottoms. And 30 thousand if without anything! Viv. You know I don't do those things, right? You can't blame me for trying! Shoot my shot, if you will. Someone who can give them that feeling of being young again. The kind of person that can show love for them, even if it's just role-playing and temporary. Alright, how about this. I'll sleep here, topless, and we can go as far as cuddling and spooning. It's like I won the lottery! What do you want for breakfast, baby? Just coffee. You're just like my ex-husband! He only wanted coffee in the mornings, too! Do I look good there? Here, you judge! Nice! Can you send it to me? I'll post it on IG. You never credit me, though. Do you want me to? You'll be plagued by gossipmongers. I don't mind. Honest question. All this I don't mind's that you say, is that part of an act or… are you being genuine? It is what it is. Well… if it's an act, it's good. Very good. I wonder where you get your solid PR skills. Isn't it obvious? But really. I want you to say it out loud. My one and only life coach. The uber-creative, uber-successful and uber-rich… Briggs Navarro. You really know how to stroke my ego. Go on, get the bill. We'll do some shopping for you. Sir! Bill-out. Who wants to share their boon first? You're a baller, bro! This is from? The attorney from Cavite. Okay... Who's next? Wow! Amazing! That's just from one dinner date with an Italian lesbian! - Exactly! - Power! My turn. Laptop. Secondhand. No charger yet, and I need to have it reformatted. But that's okay, I'll just use it for games. Why didn't you ask for a new one, Bin? Is this the teacher from Caloocan? It's fine! She's really nice. And she always cooks for me when I vist her place. They're not that rich so… that's all I asked for. Bin. Next time, ask for more! With a face like that? That's not just worth a secondhand laptop! I just feel guilty when I see that ma'am can't afford the things I want. So you adjust for her? That's not how this works, Bin! What was the price for that crappy laptop? Staying the night at her apartment? In one bed? God, just get to the point! Did you have sex? Wow. Whore! Kate! What? He sold his body! But for what? An ancient laptop and he'll pay for the repairs, too! And you? Let's see your prize! Online business training. Briggs paid for the enrollment. Worth? 20 thousand. Ten sessions. Two thousand every session. Not bad. Did you shack up with Briggs for that? Coffee date. One hour. Went shopping, 45 minutes. You hear that, Bin? I think he's my first legit sugar daddy! He's not a pervert. Talks well. What is he? A dentist. Wow, big time! When are you meeting? Tomorrow, early dinner. I'm excited and scared at the same time. That's normal. It's your first time, after all. Need help? No need. I got this. Easy peasy. Then why did you call me? No reason! I just wanted to share. You got me into this, right? And you're just informing me of your first sale? Correct! Okay! Congrats. Keep me updated. But Josie… I have just one advice for you... Don't worry! I got this! I'm a smart girl! Then he blocked me! He's not answering any of my texts or calls! What did I do wrong? I was just being authentic! Anything else you want to order? Did we order the dessert a while ago? Yes, yes! Do you want it served now? Later. It might melt. And we shouldn't rush, so we'll have more time together, right? So good! Josie... sugar dating isn't just about being authentic. You're also playing a role! Role? You're the trophy girlfriend they naturally wouldn't get either because they're old, too busy, or all dried up! It's why they pay so much in the first place! How much are you giving me tonight? Sorry? Money? Meet-up fee? How much do you want? It's just our first meeting, so... 10 thousand should do it. Did you fulfill that role? Of course! Properly? Did you put on make up so he could show you off? Did you dress up well? So if other men saw Hernan, they'd be unbelievably jealous because he has a bombshell on his arm? Is that why you lost interest in me? Hey! Hey! Why would you bring that up? You haven't moved on, have you? Who? Me? Speak for yourself! Me? You're the one who brought up the past! If you've truly moved on, you're supposed to be able to talk about it casually! Because it's water under the bridge, right? Aside from that, there's one more thing that you need to remember if you want to be a favorite of sugar daddies. What's that? Emotional connection. Did you put in any effort to build an emotional connection with Hernan? What if you had nothing to say aside from money and gifts? Where did you grow up and study again? Where will we go shopping later? You see, I'm looking for a denim jacket! Something edgy. I have a pretty edgy personality. I saw one in a K-drama, It looked so good on the lead! Isn't that available online? You can't try it on online! Sometimes they even get the wrong size! Freaking rip-offs. You're interesting. I know, right? Hurry, I saw some beautiful clothes over there. Emotional... connection. The kind where he can talk to you about the going-ons in his life! Where he's able to get a boost of self-confidence from you. Because you make him feel that there's nothing wrong with him. That he's perfect. And if he does have shortcomings, he shouldn't take it too hard. Because you make him feel that he's enough, just the way he is. Hi. Hi. Can I take off my coat? Yes, sure! So… you're a radio station manager. Which station? Oh! Just an AM one. "Just?" Don't belittle AM radio! Many people tune in to AM radio for news! I guess… Lourd, what you do is important. You being good looking is just the cherry on top! Lourd, look! That dress is so cute! Let's buy it? Huh? No need. I'm happy just window-shopping with you. - I insist! Come on! - Huh? Let's go back, we'll buy it! Come on! Come on! Theo will drive you home. Don't worry, he's been my driver for two decades. - Hi, Mr. Theo! - Hi, ma'am. Just show him the way. What about you? How will you get home? I have my own car, over there! Ah, so... this car is... My back-up car! That's mine, too! Wow! Car's okay. Let me know when you're ready. Okay. Thanks, Lourd. I had fun. Sorry! I didn't mean to! No, no... I should be the one to say sorry. This wasn't part of the deal. I got carried away, because... you're so lovable! Lovable... Whoever your partner will be, is going to be so lucky! Yeah! Anyway! Good night. Ah, Lourd! Yeah? Good night! Take care at work! Good night. Hi. Hi. Didn't you get my text? I said I'd be coming here! Sorry, we were swimming. I wasn't holding my phone. All good. How are you? I almost didn't recognize you in that get-up! Did you think I couldn't pull it off? Hey guys, we have a visitor! Josie! You're back! Hi! Did you try sugar dating? Based off your makeover, I'm assuming the answer is yes, yes? Yes! Tell us the details! What have you gotten from your sugar daddies? Wait! Answer that later. We're laying out the goods later. Join us! You can share there. Laying out the goods? My turn. 18 karat Saudi gold, worth 25 thousand. One year subscription, online master classes. What topic? Any! Culinary, marketing, public speaking… their library is massive. One year subscription, 12 thousand. Seems a bit low compared to the usual value you get? Yes! But here's the catch: I didn't do anything. Briggs just chatted me up, asked if I wanted this? Of course I said yes! Nice, nice! Well, Bin? What about you? Memory foam pillow… made in Germany. Worth? Two thousand. My god, here he goes again! What, did you spend the night at that teacher's place again? You're low-balling yourself, Bin! How many times must we remind you not to accept low offers? Well, Bin? Can't you find other sugar mommies? Why do you seem so focused on that teacher? There are many other matrons out there. You want me to find one for you? Why are you sticking with that teacher? You love her? What kind of question is that? We're talking about sugar dating! And so? That's the only alternative reason why he'd stick to the teacher! Even if all he gets in return are cheap things. She's not just a teacher, you know. She does online selling during her free time! And she's so hardworking! She has big dreams! One day, she'll be rich! Then she can come and get you, when that time comes! Correct! When she becomes rich, I'm sure, she's not going to choose me. Who am I anyway, right? Hey, Abel! Hey! - Ouch! Let me go! - Abel! - Hey! - Abel! Do you see yourself? Why wouldn't she choose you? My looks won't be like this forever. What about the size of this thing, isn't it forever? Is that enough for her to choose me? What do you even mean, Bin? Choose you as a sugar baby, or something else? If that's how low you value yourself as a sugar baby, they'll take advantage of you every time. Wait, wait. Why are you telling him off? Isn't it obvious that he loves the teacher? If you love someone, do you compute for every thing that they give you? The teacher is his sugar mommy, not their lover! If he wants the teacher to be his lover, he shouldn't treat her as a sugar mommy! He should find someone else! And how is he supposed to do that? Wouldn't that be like betraying the teacher, if he did that? That's enough! Bin. Be honest with yourself about what your relationship with the teacher really is! Before you mess up both your lives! Come on. The food I ordered is here. Can I lay out my goods? Oh my god! We forgot you were going to do that, too! Go ahead! Well... I don't have anything physical to show, but... The guy I'm dating said I could celebrate my birthday here on Tuesday! He'll pay for everything! Wow, you must've done a great job to be sponsored like that! He just took me on a date, and shopping. But I think I was able to build an emotional connection! Anyway, he's busy on Tuesday, so I can invite friends to stay overnight. And? Well, that's actually why I'm here! To invite you guys! Yes! - Party! Party! - Party! Party! My way of saying thanks for helping me understand this hustle. Especially Seb. There we go! You're one of a kind, Seb! No biggie. But I'm not free on Tuesday. Viv and I have a date. - Seb, please. - Can't. You can't even drop by for a little bit? I don't think so. Okay. Ma'am, it's sir Seb. - Seb! - Hey, Viv! You visited! Didn't you set this up? Here. For you. You're so sweet! Why are you crying? Happy birthday, Josie! Gosh, Josie! You're looking fantastic! It seems like it was just yesterday, when you were accepting those cheap gigs, now look at you... Give me some tips! Just work hard! Trust the process! The grind is the key! - Amazing! Where was this? - I just need to pee, okay? - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! Josie! Happy birthday, by the way! Says who? Love, I'll just call you later, okay? Love you! Was that the teacher? Her name is Maggie. Josie, thanks for sticking up for me the other day, okay? You know, the one about our relationship. I was right, wasn't I? You love her? Honestly, I don't see her as a sugar mommy anymore. I don't see myself as her sugar baby, either. Heck, I'm the one who declines when she wants to buy me expensive gifts. The question is... does she give you something else? Aside from material things? She's working hard for our future, bro! That's still material. When you say that word, you make it sound like it's not important. What, are they just going to lovey-dove on each other while all stressed-out? What about you? If Maggie works her ass off to make your lives better, but to the point where she doesn't have time to cuddle because she's always busy, stressed, has anxiety, and lacks sleep? Will you hold that against her? Or would you understand? Or, better yet, will you appreciate her more because she's just thinking about both of you? I guess... balance is the key? Right? Hang on… Are we still talking about Maggie and I because... I'm kind of confused. You seem so invested about our situation. I thought you weren't going to make it? You shouldn't have bought me flowers! I have so many plants in my garden! Viv. You know it's different when they're from me, right? So he's going to stay in your resthouse? I told him he only needed to be here on weekends. But he insists. I want to be with you every day! I'm just going to take a shower. Seb... we're not just planning on sugar dating. It's a real relationship. Live-in setup. He'll be here with me 24/7. So does this mean... Let's end this, Seb. Sorry! You're in a sugar relationship. You saw a better deal and took it. It's all business. You did what's best for you. So no need for apologies. I guess this is my cue to leave. Thanks, Seb. This was fun while it lasted! You said that you're not gonna make it. I thought you wouldn't make it today? I guess I could. Why don't you just let Viv take you? She seems willing to give you everything. What about my freedom? Freedom's overrated. Sure you're free, but you're struggling. What's the point? Okay. What if a sugar daddy offered to house you exclusively? On top of all the promises, gifts, and all the vacations? Will you take it? Maybe. It depends? On? How I feel about the guy! Doesn't matter if he's rich, what if he has body odor? Or bad breath? No! Hello? Yes! What do you want printed on the throw pillow cover? A picture of our baby. Got it, sir! Just send it to the email address and I'll send you a quote. Okay, sure! Thank you. Bye. Hello, ma'am, cleaning service? Come in. There, tidy up, clean up, put all the pillows you see on the dining table. Everything that's not a pillow or furniture is trash. Clear? Yes, ma'am. Pull down your face mask. Sorry? I want to see your face. Just in case you pull anything, I'll know how to describe you to the cops. Are we good, ma'am? Why did you do that? Ouch! So why? Josie, we split up ages ago! Let's not talk about the past! I still don't understand! How could you understand? You never listened to me. That's why I'm asking again! Are you done cleaning up? I just need to throw away trash bags then I'm done. What about you? Are you okay? Do you drink? I'm so tired. I don't even know if there's a future for my customized pillow business. Is business slow? No, but... I take care of almost everything. In a way, that's good, because I don't need to rely on anyone, but... What if my body breaks down? The operations will stop! Are you close to breaking down? I don't even have time to clean my own apartment! But you can still take a bath, right? Don't be dramatic. Go on, take a whiff! Come on. I'm just trying to make you smile. You're too defensive! Ah, whatever! Well, then. They're looking for me at the office. If you need anything cleaned, just contact Neat and Clean. If I book someone from Neat and Clean, will they send you for it? Depends... on who's available. Do... Do you have a personal business card? Why would I? I'm just a cleaner. But I can still request that they send you, right? You clean so well! Everyone I work with cleans just as well. That's the only thing we know, might as well be good at it, right? So that's a no? I get it. But if you want me to visit here, as a friend, I'm down. When are you free? I'm busy. But can you visit tomorrow? My stuff! That's fine! I'll take care of that. Don't you get tired? You do all the work alone? I don't have a choice. And I don't want to depend on others. In a way, if things fail, I have no one to blame but myself. Who's going to take care of you? You're just flying solo. What if you suddenly get so stressed? Are you going to cry alone in your bedroom again? That's how it is. Stress today, money tomorrow. What you need is a partner. Are you applying? Do I pass? Hello? Yes, you can pick it up at around 5 PM. Yes! Okay, bye-bye! Mister, just leave it there! Thanks! Hello? Yes, we can do neck rolls! Yes, just send me a design, and I'll send you a quote. Okay, sure. Do you need help? Ah... can you clean up? It's so messy again. Maybe later, when you leave, so I can do it all in one go. What do you want to eat? I can cook dinner. Why cook if we can just order online? It's two o'clock! I have a client meeting! What about these throw pillows? Is anyone picking these up at five? No, it's okay, I'll be back around four. What if you come home later? Have they paid? If you want, I can issue them a receipt when they pick it up. I got it, I got it. I'll come home early, alright? Was that enough reason for you to betray me? You should have just ended things! If you must know, I was only focused on the business because what I wanted was for both of us to succeed! But how? We were both struggling! If it were up to me? We'd just cuddle all day! Going out on dates. But how? We were both poor! Wasn't it obvious, Josie? I wanted to be part of your struggle! The problem with you is, you like keeping them to yourself! Yeah, I don't know anything about running a business but I was willing to learn. But all you wanted me to do was clean up all your problems and your mess. Is that why you let that matron drag you off to La Union? In exchange for an iPhone and an overnight stay at some cheapass resort? You should've just told me that was what you wanted! Just because I grew up poor doesn't mean I'll sell myself off for a phone and a vacation! Then what? Time! Attention! Emotional connection! With her? I could share all my problems in life! But I couldn't do that with you, Josie. Because you were too busy! But please, don't ask me to give you explanations again. Because it just sounds like I'm making them up. Yes, what I did was wrong, Josie. I hurt you. But I want you to understand - what was going through my head... - It's fine, alright? I get it. Do you? Sorry, Josie. Sorry if I hurt you. Sorry if I didn't understand why you were so focused on work. You know what our problem was? We weren't clear on what we wanted from each other. We were always guessing. We always assumed the worst. That's why I like sugar dating better. Everything's laid out in the open. But to tell you the truth… I've missed you. So much. My boyfriend and I just broke up. Make me your girlfriend already. Cannot be. Why? I'm going to do everything for you! Believe me, you wouldn't want me as a boyfriend. I really do! Why would you know better than me? What's going on here? Help me. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. That was some torrid kissing! Actually, she's my type. Aimee is my ideal girlfriend: fun, lovable, has a sense of humor. So what are you waiting for? Fate is literally handing her over. I can't. Why not? We're allowed to have relationships even when we're sugar dating, right? That's not the reason. Actually, it wouldn't be fair for Aimee. Imagine if we became a thing? She's just going to get hurt when she finds out what my job is. Guys, have you seen Josie? It's her birthday but she's not here. They're outside, Kate. She was talking with Seb. Seb made it? Yes. I guess love is in the air for those two again. I don't know. What about you, Bin? What do you think? I don't know. I think they're just looking for closure for their split last time. What time is it? 5 AM. What? Didn't we say just an hour? Well, we both fell asleep. It's beautiful here. When were you last at the beach? I can't remember. Always busy. Let's go? Come on! Let's go! - Let's go! - Let's go! Come on! Let's go! It's so cold! There! There! Bin-bin! Josie! Josie! Here, here, I'll go here. Too bad you couldn't make it. Next time! It's enough for me that you enjoyed your birthday. Did you receive all the presents I sent you? Yes! Thank you. Okay, I've got a meeting to get to. Let's have dinner soon, okay? Bye! See you! Bye! Seb! What's this? Ah... I just remembered I didn't have a gift for you for your birthday. So there. Wasn't that party in exchange for you helping me? Ah... I guess you're right. Sorry, I kind of forgot. Well, whatever. That's yours. Might as well. Okay. Well? Stay for lunch? In exchange for this. In exchange? No, that's fine, that's yours. It's my present for you, remember? There's no such thing! Everything has a price! Well then, okay. You can just treat me. Let's have lunch outside. Here's your dessert. Ah, we didn't get that. No, I ordered it a while ago. While you were at the restroom. Hey! That's too much Seb. This costs more than those flowers you gave me! No, no. I got this. In fact, I already paid for everything we ordered. What! Wasn't I supposed to be the one to pay? It's fine! It's cheap. That's cheap? Damn. We were supposed to be even already! Well, if you want, you can just come with me later. Where? Ocular inspection! Ocular? For? For a... photoshoot. I got an online brand partnership. It's just a small clothing brand business. Well, they want me to produce three content videos. You need an ocular for that? Why not use your place? They want somewhere outdoors. And a background I haven't used yet. So demanding. Was this the car you used last time? When? Where we first... Nevermind. That was Viv's. Our arrangement's done. So which sugar mommy owns this? This is mine, you know! I saved up for this! Hey! Lourd's asking for a selfie! Park it for a bit! Why? I'm gonna take a selfie! Then take a selfie here! He might ask who I'm with! - Hurry! - Here. How much for one? 90 pesos. Okay. Here, I'll get three for 100 each. Okay. Okay. - Thanks! - Thanks, mister. What are you going to do with those? Don't you have a vaccuum at your place? I do. I just wanted to. What kind of cheap trip is that? It seems you've forgotten, my mother makes brooms for a living. Sorry! Anyway, I need to go because Lourd's asking for an early dinner. Out of the blue? Just tell him to move it tomorrow. Just relax for today. Hey! This is a gig too, you know! You never know, we might go shopping later! How much does Lourd give you when you go out shopping? Cash, about eight thousand. But when we go shopping, we can go up to 20 thousand total. Wait. Don't think I'm not catching on. You've been at this all day! What? You're just extending our time together! Because you miss me! Didn't I say I had no gift for your birthday? So here. That's why you brought me flowers earlier? Which led to a lunch date? Which led to an ocular? And now it seems like you don't want me to see Lourd? Well? You don't want to part from me? Alright, fine! I missed your company! Are you happy? You're breaking the arrangement we made at the cottage! It's just for sex, remember? I don't want a repeat of last time. What? When the setup wasn't clear. Let's clear things up before anything else. Okay, sure. Make out, or all the way? All the way, but with protection. What's the time limit? 4 AM. They'll look for me inside, remember? It's my birthday party? One hour, max! Okay. What else? No strings attached. No I-Love-You's, no sentimental bullshit, no money, or favors involved. And no cashing in in the future for whatever. This is just for sex. Equivalent exchange. I'll get mine, you'll get yours. No kiss and tell. Clear? Clear. But fine! The morning after, a violation! But fine! Excused, because we both fell asleep! But this? How about this? What if we make another arrangement? You make the offer. Okay! We'll have dinner later? I'll give you cash. Five thousand. Then we'll go shopping after. I have a credit card. Shopping budget limit? Ten thousand. That's lower than what I get from Lourd. True. But if you move your date with Lourd to tomorrow, then you'll get more. You get some from me, and you get some from Lourd. See? Everybody's happy! Why don't I schedule you for tomorrow instead? Why do you need to go now? Because it'll be a hassle if we move it tomorrow. We're already here! Hello, Lourd? Sorry, I'm not available today. I'm still with my friend. Are you free tomorrow? Thanks! Mmm! Is this it? Got a problem? Isn't it... cheap? But it's special. Because? You can order something else. But this is enough for me. Well, if you're happy with pork and tofu, I guess I'll join you. Hey! This wasn't part of the deal! We just said shopping. What if I raise the shopping budget to 12 thousand pesos? 15 thousand. You should be clinging to my arm at that price! Okay! So, I guess... you're one of my sugar daddies now? We don't know that. Let's see if I come back. You know, there should be an... emotional connection. That's all? Yeah! Easy! Handsome, sexy, financially stable, not bad at conversations, charming... What else are you missing? What? Is that all your effort on building an emotional connection? To stroke my ego? I guess you know all these tricks! You're a Master sugar baby. Well… I guess I could play along like the other experienced sugar mommies and daddies. They're aware of roleplays like these. Is that a Master sugar daddy talking? - Hey! What are you doing? - Mmm, smells good! Level up! Before you just smelled like sweat, now you smell like a rich kid! Wow, you're something else. It's like you said I had body odor! I didn't say you smelled bad! Of course you were cleaning my apartment. It was so hot and you were all wrapped up. You're no different. Hey! Stop making things up! Even when I was so busy, I didn't neglect my hygiene! Yeah, right! I'd rather not say anything. - Hey! Ouch! - You're so mean to me! - That hurts! - You're so mean to me! - Hey! - Tch! Ouch! Hey! Deserve! Did that cost extra? Nothing in sugar dating is free. What's the price? You need to stay the night in my apartment. Where do I put these? Just there on the table. Josie! Do you need help organizing these? Josie? I'm sleepy. Let's go to bed. Wait, that's not part of the deal? Let's revise it? As we should! So what are we doing? We'll sleep in one bed. Okay. Wearing? Me? This. What about you? I'll take this off. How weak. What do you want? Remove all of that! Sure. But we'll have breakfast here tomorrow. Who's cooking? Both of us. Deal. What if we were closer? You'll wash the dishes tomorrow. Deal. Can we cuddle? In exchange for three kisses. Deal. But just on the cheek. What if we made out? How long? Unlimited! That's a pretty big demand. So no? Easy now. I'm still thinking. Sure. Deal. But we'll be naked. Deal! But the lights will be off. Deal. But we can go up to third base. That's a big demand. So no? I'll think of something. Okay, deal. But? But you have to be good. Should I turn off the lights now? Don't. I want to see you. I don't need to see Lourd until tonight. So? Maybe... you want to go out for lunch? We could. What's the catch? Nothing. No, really! Nothing, really! Okay, fine. I'll take care of the ride, you take care of... The bill? Sure. What if you just take that off the money you're giving me today? Money? Right. I forgot that the dinner date last night was for five thousand. Hello? Good morning, baby boy! Yes, Lollie? Well, are you all packed? Packed? What? Don't tell me you forgot? We agreed last week remember? That we're going to fly to Laoag this afternoon! Oh? Just kidding! Of course I didn't forget! This is me we're talking about! Would I forget that? I was just kidding. Actually, I'm just about to take a bath. Alright, message me when you're done. Andoy will pick you up. Is that okay, baby boy? Okay! Love you! Love you! Sugar mommy? Sorry, but I have to go. Just send me your bank details and I'll transfer the five thousand to you. Okay? Thanks! We're still on for later. What? We'll do the lunch date later. You have a flight remember? I'll just text Lollie. Tell her I had an emergency. That's mean. She's depending on you. Just leave. We can probably have lunch another time. Funny, huh? No matter how detailed something is, there are just some things that aren't clear? Like what? What happened last night! What's unclear about that? Everything was so clear! Every move had an agreement. Josie, we both know that was just for show! We just wanted to be with each other! Maybe that's how it was for you? Isn't that why you said sugar dating is better than a typical relationship? Right? Everything is clear! No feeling around! No double meanings! So why were you sad when Lollie called? Sad? How? We had plans set up and it got cancelled! Why would I be happy about that? But God! It's not like I'm going to mope over that! Just for lunch date? You want everything clear? Are you ready to clear everything out, Josie? Try it! Go on! I still love you, Josie. I want us to be together again. My turn now, okay? I love you, too. I miss you so much. But every time I remember what you did to me, it opens up the wound again. I lost all confidence in myself when you betrayed me. You made me feel like I wasn't enough. I said sorry, didn't I? I'm sorry! I know you regret it, Seb. I'm just saying it still hurts! What can I do? For what? So we can be together again! Together? With a job like this? And every time you have to visit a sugar mommy, I am reminded of what happened before? What if I stopped this? Just go, Seb. You might miss your flight. No, really. I don't know, okay? You're muddling things up! I've never experienced comfort like this in my life! Where I'm being taken care of! Where I get showered with gifts! Goddamn it! If I knew about this earlier, then I wouldn't have run myself ragged over a business! I'm happy like this, Seb. Stop confusing me. Good afternoon, sir! Hop on. Let me take that. All right. Let's go, sir? Sir? Let's go? Andoy, I need to drop by some place... Do we have time? You know I make brooms for a living, right? Why did you bring those here? I bought them because... I remembered you. I guess I can sell those. Just tell me the truth! Why are you here? I'm visiting you! Why? Because you're my mother! You're such an asshole! Didn't you run away that time? You left without a word. No calls, no letters! Now you just show up? Screw you. Life was hell in here! Hey! You had three square meals a day, and a room to sleep in at night! Our utilities were never cut, wasn't that enough for you? What do you think? Is that all a kid needs while growing up? What about emotional support? Life advice? That wasn't important? Not once did we even celebrate my birthday! I didn't get a single gift from you! Not even at a cheap restaurant! Nothing! You know, I get it! I knew we were poor. But to come home, and see your sole parent without any love for you? Goddamn! Who wouldn't want to run away? I got pregnant with you because your father raped me. I didn't love him, I didn't want him, and sure as hell didn't know him. He really ruined my childhood. I had so many dreams back then. But I chose to give birth to you. To raise you, accept you... But every damn day, every day that I saw your face... I couldn't forget... the disgusting things that monster did to me. You should have just aborted me. I chose to gamble. Because I thought all the pain would be erased when I gave birth to you. It didn't. But I endured all that. So if you think, I still had shortcomings as a mother, despite everything I've been through... For God's sake. Sorry about that, Sebastian, okay? I was already empty from the start! Mom, go on vacation, eat something nice, have fun for once. If you want to move someplace else, somewhere nicer, do it! I will fund you. Until you no longer feel empty. Now you're treating me like a gold digger. Mom, what can I do to make it up to you? Just visit me sometimes. If you have a wife and kids, bring them here, introduce me to them. Treat me like your mother. I've decided. I'm not doing this anymore. You've backed out of all your sugar dates? I talked to all of them. Some had tantrums... Fuck! If he doesn't show up, he won't get his allowance, I'll freeze his bank account, and most of all I won't invest in his damn business! Some accepted it gracefully. Hi, Seb. Then give me their numbers, so I can take over! What are your plans now? Honestly, I don't know. But I'm ready to take a risk. Meaning? I plan to continue that business I was planning. Oh, the professional cleaning service? Yeah. So if you want in, or to be part of the staff, the three of you are welcome. Can I sign up, bro? I've been thinking, I don't think I'll last in this kind of job. I love Maggie. We love each other. I don't want to be just her sugar baby. I want to take her out, give her gifts, take care... So you're ready to be an actual lover? What about you, Abel? Me? Me? I'm happy with this. But... When no one wants me as their baby anymore, wait for me at your office. Kate? Regular work? Ew! But I'll book you to clean my house for support. Bin. Let's talk outside. I guess it's just us now, living in your big-time sponky's house. Actually, I'm thinking of living in Europe for a bit. I think I'll earn more there. So, this means we'll lose the headquarters? Naturally! Where will I live? I'm sure you'll easily find a sponky for that! Lourd! What? Stolen shots are better! I'll prove you wrong! Wow! Beautiful! Isn't life better when it's always like this? Instead of just sometimes? How I wish. I can make it come true. If you really wish it. What do you mean? I'm happy when I'm with you. And I'm happier when I see you happy. Just like now. Can you... permanently be part of my life? I didn't really know he had a wife. I just thought he was an old bachelor. You did not strike me as naïve. But apparently you are. I'll just go. No, no. I'm not here to stake a claim on Lourd. I just wanted to see the reason behind his absence in the lives of our two children. You really are beautiful. You asshole, let go of me! Let go of me! Stop it! Listen to me! How many times have you done this to us? Tell me the truth! This is the only time! What do you mean the only time! - Please understand! - How did this happen? Tell me! - Do you love me or not? - I love you! You don't love me, you prick stop touching me! You're admitting it! You're admitting it! - Love, don't... - Let go of me! Sorry, I offered money to someone who would listen to me! I'm apologizing to you! You're embarassing us! Let go of me! You're the one at fault! You're the one with a mistress! No more! Sorry! I'll stay away from her! You're the one at fault! You're the one with a mistress! No more! Sorry! I'll stay away from her! Let go of me! Release me! Release me! Release me! Get out! Get out! No! I won't leave you! Calm down! Calm down! Get up! No! I won't get up, leave me! Get out! No! I won't get up, leave me! Get out! Bro! Take a video of me dancing in this, okay? I'll post it on Tiktok to promote our business. Sure, later. After work. Anjo! Let me see that. - Ames, did you get the email? - I forwarded it to the client. Hi! Did you receive our bank transfer earlier? Yes, sir. Your OR is here, too. Where will we bring the pillows? To my office. Come on! Sorry, we're still having this place cleaned. What about that guy who had pillow souvenirs sent to Marikina? It hasn't reflected on the account yet. - I'll follow it up later. - Okay. Oh, the OR! - Oh, right, sorry! - It's fine! - Here. - Alright, just go ahead okay? I'll do it. Okay, just meet us up later okay? I looked for your Sugarlinx account earlier. It's not there anymore. And you? Is yours still there? Isn't it obvious? Clean Slate? Was this where you worked at last time? The 'Neat and Clean' one? No. This is my own business. No way? - Yeah! - No, really? I did tell you. I'd leave that job. So what now? Who will take care of you? Myself. What about you? Me, too! Sometimes I think about going back to Sugarlinx when I get stressed with operations but... Oh, well. This is what life is. At least now, I have my own staff. That's good! You finally learned to trust people with your business. I know, right? Character development. Oh! Hold on. I need to give this to the admin! Wait here, okay? Josie! Maybe you want to... book me to clean your apartment. I mean... Clean Slate. Just let me know. We don't really have a budget for professional cleaning. We just clean up by ourselves. I guess. Let's eat out later. If you want. Of course! If you're free. What's the catch? Nothing! We'll split the bill 50-50. I'll hold you to that, okay? But if I like you, I might get the check. Whatever. I got it! I got it! 50-50? No. Just pay for the next. Wow! Next, huh? Of course! But when I officially court you again, I'll be the one paying for everything. Offically court me? Is that okay? Why would you court me again? Isn't it obvious? No. Let me make it clear then! Can we be together again? Deal.
