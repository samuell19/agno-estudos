Open this door! Open up! Open the door! Let me in! I'm family! She's crazy. Please hurry! They're on their way. Why is she doing this? I don't know. We've called the police. Let me in! I thought I heard you up last night. Yeah, I had a nightmare. What was it about? I don't remember. Am I taking you to school or not? Not. Fine. I'll pick you up at 3:30 and drop you off at Dr. Fischer's office like a good Uber driver. Can't wait. Lisa, look at me. This isn't my fault. Spoken like a true lawyer. What's that supposed to mean? That there's no arguing with you. My God, Lisa, where have you been? I texted you like 20 times this week. Sorry, Penny, I just haven't been in the mood. To talk to your best friend, really? I said I'm sorry. My parents just split up. Can I get a break? That's like half the kids in this school. It's no reason to drop your friends over it. I just have a lot on my plate right now, okay? You know what, Lisa? I hope you clear it. So, Mr. Clark, how can I help you today? So what exactly does a tax attorney do anyway? Well, in your case, I provide legal counsel for the structure and tax treatment of your business. What kind of company are you starting? Security. Turned in my shield after 20 years. I wanna live a little bit larger than my pension allows. It's dangerous work. They should pay you fellas more. Hey, you're the preacher, I'm the choir, Miss Sullivan. It's Missus. Sorry. I didn't see a wedding ring. I just assumed. Let's get started, shall we? Hey, Nate. Hey, Tim, what's up? You moved in yet? Staring at my immediate fate as we speak. Me too. I never thought I'd own my own restaurant. Well, I never thought I'd be the head chef of one. Well, I did, ever since you catered my parents' big anniversary party when I was 10. I appreciate you taking this chance on me, Nate, really, even if it blew up my life. Yeah, look, I'm sorry about you and Heather separating. Well, you offered me my dream, and I accepted it. I just hope I don't let you down. Have you tried your food? Just relax tonight. While you're relaxing, you mind coming up with a new dessert or two? Yeah, I'm gonna can the Zabaglione. No one knows what the hell it is. Hell, I don't think I do. Okay, all right, I'll see you in the morning. All right. All right. I'll get some lunch. Okay, hold on, hold on. I know it's in here. Just give me a minutes. Yeah, you said that two minutes ago. Come on! Yeah, we haven't got all day! Okay, it was on the kitchen counter this morning, and then I put it in my bag. It's just... Damn it! Everything okay? Yeah. I'm just having the worst day of my life. How are you? If leaving your wallet at home is the worst thing that's ever happened to you, you've had a pretty damn good life. How obnoxious do I sound right now? When you guys get a chance, can you let me know if this is gonna be lunch or dinner? All right, how much? 10.65. No, no, no, I can't... No, please. Help out a pretty woman and teach a lesson in manners at the same time? Whatever, man, it's your money. And your attitude. Um, thanks. Sure. Jamie. Tim. Next. Finally. Ladies, what can I get you? Thank you. You saved my life back there. You don't have to walk me to my car. I don't mind. Your wife's a lucky lady. It's, uh, it's complicated. Hmm. Do you have kids? Daughter Lisa, she's 16. How's she handling the complication? It's been hard. She feels like she had the rug pulled out from underneath her, but she knows I would never hurt her. So what do knights in shining armor do nowadays? Oh, uh, you know, whole lot of riding white stallions. Generally, a lot of jousting is involved. Actually, I'm the head chef at a new restaurant opening up on Lake Drive. So you cook too. Yep. You're just like some sort of unicorn. Yeah. What do you do? Nothing right now. I just moved into town. I'm living in the Deer Hill Apartments down the road. Are you kidding? Mm-mm. I just signed a lease there today. Wow. Building two. Three. That's crazy. Well, I guess it was fate that we met, huh? Yeah. Oh, let me get it. Watch out, hero. I got this one. Oh, don't get shy on me now, Tim. Yeah, I guess I should go, huh? Okay. Okay, see ya. I'll see you around, neighbor. Okay, yeah. Better hurry. Jaworski's gonna chew you ass off. I know. What are you doing in here? I've been looking for you all day. Hey. What, are you mad at me? I just need some space. Look, Lisa, I know you're having a really hard time with your parents' breakup, but I can't help you work through any of it if you won't talk about it. I can't help how I feel. You think that I can't? Steven, let go. Look, Lisa, I'm just trying to help. Well, now is not the time. Ow. I'm sorry, I... Sullivan, get out here now! You better get out of here before Jaws catches you. Okay. Can we talk about this later? Maybe, but right now you just have to go. Sullivan! Where do you think you're going? You've been swimming here for me for four years, and you still don't know there's no running at the pool? Sorry, Coach. I know you're going through a lot at home, but it's not a good reason to slack off over here. And you're late. Why do you ride on me so hard? Because you're good! 'Cause you're the best I've ever seen. You're better than them. You start going half ass, everybody's looking at you. Your times have been really slow this month, so what are you gonna do about it? Uh, swim faster? That'd be a good idea. And, Sullivan, at the end, I want 20 extra laps. I'm gonna be late for class. I can't... No! 20! That's it! Okay, 20. You've given me the silent treatment this entire ride here. You're taking me to a therapist. How much talking do you want one girl to do? As much as you want. Let's not pretend what I want is up for discussion, Mom. Look, I am not the one who wanted change. You can blame your dad for that. Blame. Another lawyer word? That's right, Lisa, I'm a lawyer. And I worked really hard to become one. And I work harder every day to pay for our house, this car, your clothes. I thought change was supposed to be a good thing. Yeah, it's been a blast so far. Hey, I'm the one who has to pack a bag every weekend. It's not like I'm in high school, trying to figure out my life or anything! Lisa... Fine. Just go. You know what? Go ahead. Your dad will pick you up when you're done. You know, you can hate me if you want, but I am not the bad guy here. At least he still wears his ring. I'll see you Sunday. Hi, Lisa. Are you ready? You seem reticent. Sorry. I must've missed that one in my SAT prep. Clammed up, shy. Well, what would you like me to articulate? See, you're not the only one that uses big words. You can say anything you want here. No offense, Doc. I don't really feel like talking to anyone right now. Does that include your friends? My life is way too mortifying to share with them. Let's make it simple then. Let's talk about things. Finish this sentence. Things at school are... Repetitive. Things with the swim team are... Fine, I guess. It's a lot of pressure. You have a boyfriend? Yeah, Steven. Things with Steven are... Challenging. Do you want to talk about that? No. All right. Things with your parents? I don't know. You tell me. They come here twice a week. What do they say? That they love you, that they're going through a hard time. That's pretty much all I can divulge. Are you still angry with her? Well, do they ask what I talk about? They get the same answer. Well, then hell yeah, I'm angry. My Mom talks about how it's unfair. Well, you know what's unfair? My Dad giving up his entire career, his special thing, to be Mr. Mom, so she can be, what, some hotshot lawyer? Well, I'd say your dad's special thing is being your dad. Have you ever tried his chicken saltimbocca? I have not. Yeah, because only me and my mom have. And after 16 years of being on the sidelines, it's time for him to show everyone how great he is. I see that's important to you. Of course it's important to me. He's taken care of me my entire life. Well, what about your mother's special thing? Which one, work or spin class? That's a pretty cold response. Well, she's a pretty cold woman. Look, I'll tell you, Doc, I'm on Team Dad all the way. Hey, Dad. Hey, kiddo. So what going on with the official opening? Uh, we had to push it a week. Why? Is everything okay? Me parent, you kid. I should be asking those questions. I've been answering them all day. How was therapy? Is it helping? Yeah, it helps, I think. Okay, your turn. It's just a liquor license thing, although I do expect the investors to run for the hills once they find out a rookie is running the kitchen. Please, they're gonna be running for the banks with all this town's money. We'll see. Ready for the grand tour? Let's go. Ah, the palace. There's my place right there. Or our place. Okay. And I got a pool. And we have a Jacuzzi, and there's a gym up front. It's good stuff. Come on. Hey. So? How do you like the place? I like it. Yeah, it's great. Good. I just figured if we're gonna be here for a while, you know, I mean, if we're gonna do this, right? So, um... Look, kiddo, I just... I just want you to know that I'm aware of the sacrifices that you're making to spend time with me. I mean, you're a teenager for Christ's sake. You should be out there with your friends on the weekends, right? Don't sweat it, Dad. I'm in hermit mode right now. Yeah, that doesn't mean you should be stuck in the middle of some second-act twist of your parent's marriage. It's okay. It's selfish. I'm selfish. Because you're living for someone other than us for once? I wish Mom could try to wrap her head around it, but, you know, she's being such a... Don't, don't put it on her, okay? It's not fair. Don't do that. Look, they call it a "trial separation" for a reason. I'm gonna try it on for size. I'm sure Dr. Fischer would put it better. "There's something wrong with your marriage, dear." "You have to figure it out." Yes, that's exactly it. Okay, I'm gonna get a swim in before dinner. Okay. The place looks really awesome, Dad. Thank you. I love you. Love you too. Ah, you scared me. I don't even know how to doggy style or... Is that what I mean? I don't know. You training for the Olympics? No. I'm just in high school. Oh, God, I miss high school. I'm Jamie. Lisa. I've lived here about a month, and I haven't seen you around. Yeah, my dad just moved in. I'm here mostly on the weekends. Did your parents just split up? Yeah. Let me guess. You're doing the dance of the part-time parents. In one corner, you got Mom, the weekday tyrant, makes you take your vitamins, do your homework, and is a basic pain in the ass. And in the other, you've got your dad, who let's you stay up late, do whatever you want, but just doesn't know quite what to say to you. Am I close? Something like that, yeah. Do you have a boyfriend? Well... Hmm. Guys can be jerks sometimes. Did he do that to your arm? It was an accident. Grabbing your wrist and squeezing doesn't sound like an accident. No, it was me. I did it when I yanked it away. If you want my opinion, a guy shouldn't be grabbing your wrist in the first place. Lisa. Who's this? She's my friend. Okay, listen. I know you haven't been feeling like talking much. Then why are you here? Who are you again? I'm her new friend. Who are you? Her best friend. Can we talk? Alone? Who's that? Jamie. I just met her. I'm glad to see you guys are having a great time together. Penny, it's not you. I'm just hiding out for a while. Is everything okay over here? Uh, yeah. Thanks for asking. Come on. Ashley and Ben are at the Lakewood Mall. Let's do a little retail damage. I shouldn't. It's my first weekend here. I should stay. Are you sure? Okay, you're weird. And you? You can call me when you're ready to get your life back. Penny, I'm sorry! Sorry. Did I overstep my boundary there? You just seemed really uncomfortable. It's fine. I don't wanna be around people who know me well. Well, I don't like her. Lisa! Is that your dad? Yeah. I can see where you get your good looks. Hey, Tim! I'm so sorry. I'm terrible with names. It's Jamie. Jamie. All together now. Jamie, okay. I still owe you 10 bucks. Forget it. It's okay. Did you know that your dad's a hero? I know. It was really nothing. Ready to eat, kiddo? Yeah, sure. Nice to meet you. Yeah, it was really good meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you around. You too. Yeah, okay, see ya. Come on. Mmm. Mmm. Thanks for the help, Lisa. Thanks for making my dad happy. I'm pretty sure you do that. Good night. Ta-da! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you kidding? What did you put in the sauce, crack? Just a little sugar. Okay, this place is gonna destroy. I don't know. 90% of these places crash and burn in the first year. Yeah, because they don't have the secret formula. I'm so proud of you, Dad. I'm proud of you. Hello, Lisa. Hi, Tim. So what do you think about our cute neighbor? Cute? Believe it or not, kiddo, I could measure a woman's appeal even before the separation. Um, yeah, she's funny. She's the only person I know from my away home that's not from home, besides you. Well, she is a little older than you, but I'm glad you met a friend. She seems super chill. Yeah. Ugh. I am stuffed. Great. Then my job is done. How about a movie? Sure. Great. What are you thinking? I don't care, as long as it's funny. Funny. We could do funny. I have funny. Let's do it. Hey, Mrs. Sullivan, what's up? Hi, Penny, sorry to bother you. I'm looking for Lisa, and she's not answering her phone. Well, she's not not answering any of my calls now either. I know, I'm sorry. She's really been pulling away from everyone. Well, except her father. And Jamie. Who? Some rude neighbor of Mr. Sullivan's. How old is she? I don't know, in her 30's, maybe. What does she... What does she look like? Real pretty, but she's weird. Lisa and I were like talking at the pool, and she got all up in my face. But please, don't tell her anything. She'll never talk to me again. Yeah, don't worry. I won't tell her. All right, see you later. Bye. All right. You look angry today. Well, yeah. My husband has put himself before this family, so of course I'm angry. Gimme a break. I've always taken a back seat in this marriage. Oh, so raising our kid is the same thing as taking a back seat? Our kid is grown now. She's 16. And she believes in me. She feels guilty. There is a difference, Tim. And you wonder why she won't warm up to you? Oh, please. It has been the two of you versus me since she was five. The inside jokes, the eye rolls behind my back you think I can't see. I love your cooking, Tim, I do. You know I love your cooking, but the deal was is that you would be with Lisa until she left the nest. Because it made sense at the time. Seriously, why do you think I went to culinary school? To pursue your dreams? When was it my turn? Okay, I want you to follow your dream, Tim, I do. I just don't understand why you can't wait until she leaves for college. Because the opportunity is now. I get it. But have you even thought that you may just be blowing up this family for a pipe dream? And who is Jamie? What? Why? I talked to Penny. She said this Jamie treated her like crap when she stopped by last week. She's just a neighbor, that's it. It's not uncommon to feel threatened in situations when a new woman's introduced into the mix. No one's introducing anyone! And I don't feel threatened! Why don't we just end it here? The session, not your marriage. You know that I'm right, Tim. Oh, I didn't see you. Do all of you Sullivans swim? Lisa kicks my ass every time. Is there room for me in there? It's a big pool. I'm not very good. Oh, come on, I'll show you. I bet you can. Okay, kick your legs. Kick my legs? Kick your legs out. You gotta make 'em strong. Stretch 'em out. Whoo! Swim on your back. I'm gonna let you go. I'll race you. I'm gonna beat you. I'm coming. You won. Whoo! You're fast. I won. You're really good. Not bad for an old man, huh? Oh, not bad for a young man. So what's your story? What do you mean, romantically? Sure. Ugh, don't ask. Show me a room full of guys, and I'll always pick the jerk. Right. How'd you end up here? Uh... I moved in with my parents last January. They both got cancer around the same time. It's been one hell of a year, let me tell you. I lost my mom in June to breast. And then my dad followed her in August to colon. Wow. He always let her go first. Well, I don't know you very well, but it seems like you were a pretty good daughter. Yeah, I hope so. Yeah, they left me the house. It's just so big. I don't need another reminder that I'm all out of family. I think I'll move in when I have that part figured out. What about you? How are you dealing with your mid-life madness? Honestly, I'm just, I'm just worried about Lisa. I mean, she could really use a friend right now. I'm glad she met you. Sounds like she could use a mother. She has a mom. It's just... Complicated. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing now? Let's go do something. It's a little late for coffee. No. I've got a better idea. Oh, yeah? I know this great place, but... you have to show me you can do something first. Uh-oh, what? What? This. All right, party-time people, are you ready? Yes! I said, are you ready? Yes! Whoo! Sake bomb! Chug, chug, chug, chug! Whoo! And that's how it's done! All right, I'll check on you guys later, okay? Thank you. That's four in a row. You win. Oh, yeah? What do I win? Oh, I don't have any prizes on me right now. Keep checking. I'm sure there's something in there worth giving. What do you call these things again? Sake bombs. It's in the chant. Right. They're fun. I'm fun. I can't argue with that. You are fun. More than your wife? Heather's fun. Yeah, but she doesn't know you. She doesn't? I mean, I'm sure she did at one time, but it's been a long time. Tell me I'm wrong. You're awesome, and you deserve the best. And don't let anyone tell you different. I know you got this wife, and you're not quite sure what to do with her, but if you had the right wife, you'd know what to do. Wouldn't you? Wait a second, wait a second. Hold on. What am I doing here? You're having fun. You know what? I shouldn't, actually. No, you can, you can. I can? You can. Why can I? 'Cause you can. You know what? Actually, I can't do this. Oh, no, no, no, no. I really shouldn't. You can. I shouldn't. You can. I can? Come on, come on. No, over here. There you go. I'm serious. I am a little drunk. I know. You are more than a little... You gotta go. No. You gotta go. I'm sorry. Just a little... I'm sorry. Just... Look, I have a family. Good for you. I'm sorry. No. I'm gonna go. Jamie, come on. I'm sorry! Lisa! Lisa! How'd you find out where my dad lives? I called your mom. She says hi. Why won't you return my texts? If it makes you feel better, you're the only one. Why would that make me feel any better? Am I just like everyone else now? Hey, hey, hey! You get away from her! Excuse me? I'm her boyfriend. Oh, you're the guy that left the bruises on her arm. What? No. You know I would never mean to hurt you. I never said you did. Don't make excuses for him. Okay, look, just leave us alone. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You better get out of here before I call the cops. Jamie, what are you doing? He's not bothering me at all! Yeah, well, he's bothering me. Okay, just calm down. We'll talk another time. Jamie, what the hell was that? You've got it all wrong! Okay, okay, you're right. I can be overly protective sometimes. Okay? Let me make it up to you. How? Come on. Cheers. Do not tell your dad about this. You don't tell my dad. Where is he, by the way? Inventory at the restaurant. So does he know about... What's the jerk's name? I told you, he's a nice guy. Don't be a victim, Lisa. He's pathetic, and he knows it. Where'd you learn those tricks out there anyway? It was pretty badass. Krav magra. I've had a few jerks in my life too. I'm so tired. You've got a lot going on. You've got school, swimming, that guy, your folks. I keep having this weird nightmare. I'm swimming, and I'm winning, and I'm like, "Give me the trophy." But then, my arms and my legs fill up with lead, and I'm gripping at the edge of the pool and everybody's staring at me, my teachers, the students, even the janitor, and they're all thinking the same thing. They're thinking, "She's barely hanging on." Don't stop there. Finish what you're gonna say. It's just like I pictured my senior year so differently, and then seeing my dad, he's so happy, but he couldn't have picked a worse time. And I can't say anything to him. He's done so much for me. He's like the only person I talk to, other than my shrink. Well, and me. Yeah, and you. I just feel... out of control. Oh. Oh. I've got something for that. Whoo! Every time! Really? Every time? Yeah, every time. You wanna try? Just aim and squeeze. Just don't tell your dad about it. Come on, Sullivan, you've got a pistol in your hand. Right there, go ahead. Try it again. Okay. Okay, yeah, we gotta work on your aim. But you know something that'll help your shot? What? Tell me. You just gotta picture somebody that you absolutely hate. Like Steven. What? I bet you you could drive a bullet through his skull. What, no! I don't hate Steven, and I certainly don't wanna kill him. Here. Come on! It was just a joke! Oh, come on, don't hate me. No, I don't hate you, Jamie. I didn't like what you said. Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what? I've just been really, really emotional, okay? Sorry. Place looks great. What's it take for a girl to get a drink around here? We're not open yet, but I guess I can make an exception. Whiskey. Mmm. Do you know what I love about whiskey? What? Everything. Have a drink with me. Uh, no. Just one. I can't. I got a thousand things to do before we open. Oh, there he goes again, following all the rules. About the other night... Yes, about the other night. Look, uh, I'm really sorry. I really am. I, um, I was having fun, but I shouldn't have started something that I knew I couldn't finish. Mmm. Shouldn't or couldn't? Because you can and you should. I'm married. I don't see your wife around here. Have you ever thought that maybe there's a reason I entered your life at this exact moment? You know, fate can be a fickle thing. If you ignore its signs, it just goes away. And I don't think you want me going away, do you, Tim? Tim! Think about it. Who was that? Neighbor at my apartment. You two, uh... No. No, and I'm not. I got way too much at stake. Heather would absolutely kill me. Hmm. Teacher's so annoying. I have to go to practice now. I'll see you around. See ya. Jamie? I'm here to kidnap you. What? Let's go catch a movie. I can't. Why? I have swim practice. Come on, blow it off. Jamie, I can't leave school right now. Okay. You know what? You're totally right. You should go do your swim thing. Thanks. Okay, then. See you later! Bye! Freak. Come on, Sullivan, kick those legs! Here you come! Come on! Whew! What's come over you? You're really killing it today. Wow. I guess I just finally got a grip on things. That's a good thing 'cause we got Somerville coming up. I heard those girls have chlorine in their veins. And you've got the tools to beat every single one of 'em. No pressure. Look, just do your best. That's all I've been trying to tell you to do all this time. Don't surrender, don't retreat, never give up. I think I can do that. You think? I can do that. Get back in the water. Hi. Hi. Are you... I'm just dropping this off. Oh, yeah, I guess her clothes have two homes now. Yeah. So hey, you got any of that great coffee going on in there? Um, yeah, come on in. Here you go. Mmm. So tomorrow is your big opening. Are you ready? If by "ready," you mean haven't slept in days and breaking into cold sweats every 10 minutes, I'm ready. You coming? Is Jamie going? I don't know, probably. I hope you come. I could really use some friendly faces around. This look like a friendly face? Downright chummy. I really don't want her there, Tim. Ah, what's the big deal? Hopefully, it'll be so busy, we'll never notice her. Come on, me or her? Who do you want there, Tim? Okay. Okay, fine. See you at the opening. It means the world to me. Okay. All right. Bye. I'm really glad you came, Mom. Look, I want your Dad to win just as much as you do. We might be going through a little something right now, but I still love him. We just hit a speed bump. It happens to the best marriages. Some just take a little longer to clear. Dr. Fischer been getting to you too? You might be onto something there. So who is this Jamie that you've befriended? How do you know about Jamie? Penny told me. Don't be mad, Lisa. She was worried about you. No, I'm not mad. She was actually right about her. But Jamie was really cool with me, Mom. She was there when I needed her. Okay. I guess I could thank her for that. No, don't bother. I'm so over it. Yeah? Yeah. She's like way too much. Hmm. Let's go, come on. Wow. Welcome! It looks amazing! Thank you very much. Thanks for coming. Come. I've got the best seats in the house. Come. Thank you. I'll let Tim know you're here. Great. All right. Hey, Tim. Yeah? Your family's here. Exciting. Hey. How are you? Oh, my God, it's packed. What did I tell you? You were right, kiddo. Are you nervous? Not now. You staying for brunch, both of you? Of course. Good. Wish me luck. Good luck. Good luck. Okay, I'll see you soon. Here you go. Thank you. Thank you. You're Tim's family, right? That's us. Oh, lucky. His cooking gives me life. It gives her life? She means it's amazing, Mom. Oh. Bet you Jamie would've known that, huh? Oh, my God, here she comes. Who? What do you mean? Hi, Jamie. Hi. You must be the infamous neighbor I've heard so much about. In the flesh. I'm Heather, Lisa's mom, Tim's wife. I'm assuming you've heard of me too. I know who you are. Now what? Now I'm gonna ask you to politely walk away. Or what? Or I'll ask you not so politely. You can ask me any way you want. I'm not going anywhere. I have just as much right to be here as you. Oh, is that what you think? Okay, come on, time to go. I just got here! What? Sorry, sorry. Tim! Jamie, you gotta go now. Because of her? Tim, I got this. Heather, please. I got this. Let's go outside. Age before beauty. Listen, I know what you're gonna say. I don't know where you came from, and I don't wanna know. What I do want is for you to listen to me right now. God, you do look older than in your pictures. Don't waste your time trying to insult me, girlie. There's nothing you can say that will shake this woman's confidence. Are you sure about that? I don't care what kinda bond you think you formed with them. It never happened. Even if you think it did in that sick little mind of yours, it's over now. My husband, my kid, my family. Hmm, interesting 'cause I think... ...that's your husband kissing my neck. And, oh, there's my hand on his chest. And oop! Guess what part of me got involved right after this one. Don't be jealous, Heather. You can't fight fate. Last warning. If you come near my family again, I will end you. You understand me? Tell Lisa I'll call. You slept with her. Oh, my God. What, what? No, I... No! She showed me the pictures! All we did was kiss, I swear. We were crazy drunk, Heather. I swear it. I must be the crazy one. Lisa, come on. Please, honey. Mom. It's okay. I'll call later. Yeah, so will your slutty neighbor. Tim, we need to talk. What the hell was that? Sorry. It won't happen again. Yeah, damn straight. You need to keep that psycho out of here, all right? I have got a lot of money riding on this place, Tim. Please don't make me regret this. Give me one good reason not to hang up on you. Heather, I was drunk. It was after that big fight we had at Dr. Fischer's office. Why should I believe you? 'Cause I'm telling the truth, I swear. We were just figuring this thing out, weren't we? Let's not let her get in the middle of this. Look, I'm at work. I have to go. Goodbye, Tim. All right, bye. Your family? Yes. Nice. So do you have any questions about the documents? I really have no idea what it is I'm looking at here. Oh, I can certainly explain. No, I trust you. Thanks for your time on this. You're very welcome, Mr. Clark. Call me Patrick. Patrick, I was wondering. Um... How would you like to earn a big fat discount on my time? How big and fat we talkin'? I was thinking free. What exactly is it that you need, Mrs. Sullivan? Call me Heather. Answer. Answer! This is Lisa. Leave a message. Ugh! Damn it! Lisa? Steven. Who was that weird lady you were with the other day? Jamie, my dad's new neighbor. What'd you tell her about us? Nothing. She just has a vivid imagination. Look, I can't talk right now. I have to go to practice. Sullivan, what's going on over there? I'm just talking to my girlfriend for a second. Well, your second's up, Geiger. Sorry, Coach. Now, Sullivan, get back to it. You gotta go. Hi. Hi. Are you okay? Can we talk? Of course. First, my parents split up, and now Steve and I have been arguing. Really? What are you guys arguing about? How I've been MIA lately. You? I really missed you. Good. So how's your friend Jamie? You were totally right. She's crazy. It's like a thing now. Here's my girl. Come on. Hey, Paul. Yeah, it's me. No, I just talked to her. I asked her about that lady, and she totally blew me off. I warned you, kid. I've been hanging out with with someone new the last couple of weeks. Do you mean, Jamie? You know about Jamie, too? She came up in my last session with your parents. Yeah, well, she turned out to be kinda psycho. That's not a very nice word. She so did though. But for a while, she was helping. Sometimes it's easier to open up to a stranger than a friend. Less fear of being judged. It's one of the reasons you and I talk so freely. I see you really reconciling these emotions, Lisa. It's a good sign. I'd say you're going to be just fine. Hey. What's wrong? The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His namesake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointeth my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and virtue shall follow me all of the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of Lord forever. You okay, kiddo? Not really. I am so sorry. I just... I can't believe he's gone. Maybe you shouldn't swim in tomorrow's meet, huh? I'm sure your coach will understand. No, he won't, actually. Yeah, yeah. Um, uh-huh. Uh, yeah. Sam, it's Patrick. I need a favor. Yeah, Sam, I'm bored as hell since I retired. Just listen. I need a DNA profile done. Hey, I didn't see the filets. I already put them inside. What do you got in there? Calamari. Smells a little fishy. Ha ha. Very funny. Tim, hey. What are you doing here? I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the other day. No, no. I mean it. You cannot be here. Okay, that's not what you were saying the other night at your apartment. That's exactly what I said. Tim, did you really think I was just gonna go away? You told my wife we had sex. So? So that's a lie. I did it for us. Why would you do that? Tim, you and I both know that I am better for you and Lisa than that bitch ever will be. Let me show you... You just stay away from us, okay? I thought you were a guy that would never hurt his kid. That's what I'm being now. Why are you doing this to our family? Just go away, okay? Now! Just... How come the hottest chicks are always the craziest, huh? I need to make this go away, Tim. I think I just did. All right. Well, do you believe him? That all he did was kiss her? Yes. And is that something you can see yourself getting over? Yes. She's just... Ugh.. Well, then maybe this was just the shakeup you two needed to realize what's important and what's not. Maybe it's a good thing. Let's not get crazy. Though, you know, I do feel closer to him because of it. One of the flaws I've found in human nature is the ability to come together over a common enemy. Where is he anyway? It's so strange that he's running late. Why is that? Because I'm the one who runs late. You know, gotta work, gotta work. But? When I'm being really honest with myself, I knew he was fed up a long time ago, and I ignored it because, hey, you know things were great for me, right? But when I saw him cooking in that restaurant, before Hurricane Jamie came running through the place, it just, uh, it looked right. Sorry. Traffic was insane. It's okay. We were just talking. About what? Regrets. Ah, yeah. Uh, look, um... Look, all I want is for our family to be together again. Nothing else matters. Hey, so what do you say we go to Lisa's swim meet together? I bet she'd like that. It's a date. Full disclosure, Counselor, I did see Jamie a few hours ago. Where? At the restaurant. She stopped by and acted like there was nothing wrong. She's sick, Tim. I'm serious. I don't want Lisa anywhere near her. I parked right up here. I don't think we have to worry about it. I'm pretty sure she's 100% clear on the situation. What's wrong? Lisa, Lisa! Go, Lisa! Go, Lisa! Go, go, go, Lisa! Go, Lisa! Go, go, go, Lisa! Who's number one? Whoo! Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? You're supposed to be concentrating. Sorry, Coach, It's just, I... It's just what? Who is that? Go, go, Lisa! Don't ask. Well, I'm gonna kick her out. You need to get ready 'cause you're up next. Go, Lisa, go, Lisa, whoo! Lisa's number one! Go, Lisa! Go, Lisa! Hi. Hi. How are you doing? Good. What's your name? Jamie. Can you lower your voice a little bit? 'Cause you're distracting my team. I can cheer as loud as I want. Oh, sure, but not today. Okay, well, I'm here for Lisa, so... Well, so am I. Her dad asked me to look after her. That's my job. Just bring it down a little bit. For me. See that security guard down there? Well, I'm just gonna ask him to come over and ask you to leave. You wanna make a big scene about it? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, fine, I'll go. Good, good, good. I can't believe that lunatic trashed my car. We can't prove it was her. Do you have any doubt? No. Without any evidence, the cops have nothing to go on. It's just a car, Heather. We'll figure it out. Hi. We're here for Lisa's race. Lisa Sullivan. We didn't miss it, did we? She swims the 500 Freestyle. She's coming up next. Are you the parents? Yes. Oh, that's funny. She said you were separated. Yeah, we're working on that. Listen, she's a good kid, so work it out. Yes, Coach. Yes, Coach. So they call you "Jaws"? I'm the big fish. What can I say? Great. Hey, there's Nate and Penny. Let's go join them. Okay. Thank you. Sure. Good luck, Lisa. We're rooting for you. Come on, you can do this! You got this, girl. Kill it. It's fine. You'll do great. Thanks. Okay, Sullivan, this is your big day. Are you ready? Let me see the Phelps face. Coach, no. Come on, show me! There it is! Okay. All right, give 'em hell. Quiet for the start, please. On your mark, get set... Come on, Lisa! Go, go, go! Come on! Go, Lisa! Come on, baby! Yes! Go, go, go! Lisa, go! Come on, smooth strokes! Come on! Kick it! Bring it home! All right! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa! Go, Lisa! Three, two, one. Go, Lisa! Whoo! Leave a message for Heather Sullivan after the beep. Mrs. Sullivan, this is Patrick Clark. Got some info today on your little troublemaker you need to know about. Two years ago, she was living in Rockdale, taking care of an elderly couple, a Jane and David Robertson. I'm at the Robertson house right now. I'll just take a quick look inside. Holy crap. Leave a message for Heather Sullivan after the beep. You were so picky about your car. You must hate this rental. Not really. Change is supposed to be good, right? Right. I'm sorry, Mom. For what? Inviting the vampire in. And then she trashed your car. Oh, you didn't know, sweetie. Neither did your dad. That's the thing about people. They will show you what they want you to see until you look close enough to see the truth. Dr. Fischer again? That one's all me. Okay, Mom. Okay. Have a good one. Hi. Hi, Penny. Bye, Mom. Bye. I know. It's silly to get so excited. We only live a few blocks away. It's just been a while since she let me drop her off. It's been a crazy few months for all of us, but I think it's over now. Jamie too? I think she's learned her lesson by now. I hope so. This has all been so draining. Tell me about it. If I didn't just start this job, I would take us all on a little vacation. We'll definitely have to do it while Lisa's away at college. Oh, my God, yes. Seriously, when is the last time we went away, just you and me? Aruba, the little hut on the beach. Oh, yeah. How soon can you be out of your apartment? I am packing up as we speak. I will be out before lunch. You better be. I miss you. All right. I'll call you later. Okay. What the hell do you want? Hello, Tim. Yes, I know you're mad at me. And you're right. I took things way too far. You think? It's funny. You don't know how screwed up you really are until you trash a luxury car. Jamie, it's not funny, okay? At least you admit what you did. But do just yourself and everyone else a favor and just get yourself some help, please. You know, believe it or not, I'm actually on my way to go see a shrink right now. And that's why I'm calling you. You need to come over. Jamie, I'm not coming. Look, I'm not gonna be here. The door's unlocked. The thing is, I took something that belongs to you, and I feel really bad about it. Whoa. What'd you take? A framed family photo. I found it in a box in your closet. Why? Why would you take that? That's a really good question. I should ask my new shrink. Look, I'm sure you want it back, so just come over and get it, okay? Okay. Oh, my God. What the hell? You gotta be kidding me. She's crazy. All right. Check your Instagram later. I'm gonna post our song session. Don't you dare. Okay, I'll call you after? Okay, boo. Bye, chica! Bye, girl. Lisa? Lisa, are you here? Huh? What the... Jamie? Hi, Heather! In case you're wondering, Tim and Lisa have moved in with me at 1933 Grant Avenue. Have a nice life. Jamie, wait, wait, don't hang up! Please, please, please... 911. What's your emergency? You have to send officers to 1933 Grant Avenue right now! Ma'am, stay calm, ma'am. No, I think a woman just kidnapped my daughter! You have to hurry, please! Don't hang up. Stay on the line. Where am I? Dad? Dad. Dad, please wake up. Dad, please wake up! Are you guys ready? Look what I got! Okay, now I just wanted to say I'm so sorry I couldn't be there for you yesterday. There were outside forces working against me, but I am so proud of you. I'm actually really proud of our whole family. And how much does this place rock? Whose house is this? It used to be my parents. Yeah, and I swear, I miss them every single day, even if they did put a restraining order against me. Big mistake. But now that I've got a family, it's mine 'cause I've earned it. What's going on? Dad. Oh, baby, I'm taking control of things. Yeah, you're in no condition to do that, and you made that very, very clear yesterday. So Jamie took the wheel, and all you two have to do is sit there and listen. First things first. Stop looking at me like that. I am a better wife and mother than she ever was. Do you think she has your back, baby? No way. And you. Do you think she'd run over that abusive prick for you? Steven? Nobody hurts my girl. Nobody. You'll never get away with this. You don't think I know that this is temporary? I'm not crazy, Tim. I would rather have 10 minutes... with real family... than one more second alone. So what are you gonna do with us? Well, I know it's not the popular opinion, but I have always been a fan of the murder-suicide. I think it's really romantic. And that way, we'll be together in the end. It's not too late! Come on, Tim. We both know it's too late for anything but this. The only problem is, I just... I don't know which of you to kill first. Me, me, me, me! Please, please! No, Dad! Dad, Dad. I know. It's like husband, daughter. Husband, daughter. It's a real Sophie's Choice I'm in here. Call me old-fashioned, but I think ladies should go first. Please, please, please kill me first, please. Keep your shirt on. You're next. Don't worry. Shh. Damn you! Please don't. Please, please. Lisa! Everything's gonna be okay. Please. We all be together very soon. No, no, no! Please don't! No! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, Dad! Mom! My kid, my husband, my family. I thought you were my husband and my daughter! We're the perfect family! No! No! No! No! No! No! So you had the tour. That's good. It's gonna take a minute to get the lay of the land, but you'll catch on. They all do. Now, I know how challenging first days can be, especially here, so let's make a deal. I'll be honest with you if you'll be honest with me. If we can do that, we can get you to where you need to be. So do you have any questions for me? You don't understand. I'm not the patient. I came here to work. I'm an orderly, Doctor. I-I'm the new orderly. Jamie. You said you were going to behave. What did we just say about honesty? She's the patient, Doctor. She knocked me out, took my clothes. You'd better take her to her padded room now, please. Yes, Doctor. Then I'll be leaving. My shift is over. Have a good evening. Oh, I will. Trust me, I will.
