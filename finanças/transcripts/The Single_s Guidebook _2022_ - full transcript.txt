Ah, Molly. It's you. What updates do you have for us today? These are terrific in theory. Horrific to actually use. But this is actual magic. Oh... Order me one of those today. The review, witty but still honest, is in your inbox along with the product shots. So, since when are you a product tester on top of being a content creator? Regina asked me to do both for this piece, so I said yes. And forfeited what minimal free time you still have? Work comes first. How does Lucas feel about that? Oh, well... We might have broken up last night. What? She means, "What? Florals for spring? How exciting!" Right, Jess? Yeah. Ooh. It's Thursday. What are you gonna do tonight? Mm. We have trivia on Thursdays. We as in the you and Lucas that are no more "we"? That we? Yes, that we. I just thought Lucas was solid so I could focus on other things, like work. Do you want my opinion? Sure. You are amazing. You are hardworking and talented and funny when you give yourself the chance to be. You deserve some space for you, outside of work, outside of Lucas. Would it be weird to say I wouldn't even know what that looks like? Yes, but I know what you mean. - What? - Regina just handed out the spring assignments. Who got the daily fashion coverage? - Uh... - Sara did. Oh, great. That is great for Sarah. I'm sure you've heard, but Agency is bringing on a full-time content strategist. And you, James, Jenna, and Sarah are up for the position. Your spring assignments are how we will be selecting the candidate. What's my assignment? My daughter recently launched a line of subscription boxes called Gal Pal Box that are delivered to your door each month and are filled with products that help you live your best life. Since you recently found yourself single... How'd you know I'm single? News travels fast in this place. Anyway, I want you to take those products and turn them into a cute series on reclaiming independence after a breakup where you chronicle your adventures in singlehood. That sounds very personal. Can we just do the standard unboxing situation with, like, a cool little infographic rating each product. I have some ideas on, like, this apple-shaped... That is so pass√©. I want this to be a narrative. Something that people will be excited to follow, to tune into. Is there any other assignment I can do? Maybe something less about me. I want you to do these series. You're a fantastic writer, but I need to know you can handle anything if I'm going to give you that full-time position. Right. Sounds great. Great. We're calling it the Single's Guidebook. I'll get you your products this afternoon and you can get started right away. Make this series count and that full-time position could be yours. Well... No pressure or anything. Yeah, none at all. Good luck. I'm here if you need me. My bookshelf. Uh, hey there. Um, need any help? No, but thank you, Jackson. Uh, it might be better if you take your heels off. Why is that the first go-to? "Take off your heels, it'll be easier." Just a suggestion. Have you ever worn heels? No, no, I haven't. You would have no idea, then, how hard or easy it is to move something in them. You sure you don't want any help? Oh, I'm sure. I wanna do it on my own 'cause I can. 'Cause I can do anything... on my... my... own. All right, well, may the Force be with you. I've never seen Star Trek. Fascinating. Goodnight. You're in early. Oh, I had some stuff to get done this morning. Are you sure you're not just throwing yourself into work instead of actually processing your feelings? No, that's not what I'm doing. That's not what I'm wholly doing. But I'll have you know, I did a meditation last night. Oh, yeah? How was that? It was very productive. Now I'm trying to find some singles events for this series. Ooh, how's it going? Not great. A tap/polka dancing class. That's inventive. Dog grooming class. No dog required. How does that even work? Crypto Currency for a Life Solo. That... that is why I don't go near the singles scene. These are all so off-brand. There are no solid options for the series. Yeah, there are a lot of duds out there. Oh, what about this? Build-Your-Own Hydroponics class. That sounds really... Oh, it's full. Actually, a lot of these are full. Oh, what about this one? A Gourmet Cooking for a Party of One class. That could be fun. That sounds only kind of sad. You're looking at this the wrong way. And how is that? Like something to overcome instead of a ride on the journey of life. Hey, I also do meditation. And done. We're confirmed. What, you're going too? Yeah, why not? I'm single. What happened to Marvin? Oh, well, we decided that the only thing we actually had in common was our insane pop culture knowledge and that that's not actually enough to sustain a relationship, so I'm a free agent. All right, let's get you some great content for this series and land you that full-time spot. This is gonna be great. Look excited. Oh, that is looking so good. You too, Jenny. Love that. Liam, keep it up. - You're doing a great job, okay? - Thank you. Great, thank you, Mr. Larson. All right, we'll see you soon. You'll never guess who I just got off the phone with. Mr. Larson. Okay. He says he wants to meet. He says that Arts Ed 4 Youth is the kind of thing his firm wants to invest in. That's huge. Huge, huge! The only thing is, he wants us to have more reach. So I'm gonna reinvigorate our social media platforms. If you could just start working the actual pitch. Wait, you're gonna do social media? You don't know anything about social media. I'm hip and cool and totally with the times. Plus, I spent like six hours this morning reading about demographics and impressions, peak post times. Thank goodness for the internet. Right. Oh, uh, you still got that thing tonight? Uh, yeah, you wanna come? Absolutely not. But can't wait to hear about it after, yeah? Okay. Sorry about that. Ready? I am so sorry, but I can't go with you tonight. We're having a meltdown with one of our clients in LA and I have to stay and figure this out. Anything I can help with? No, it's just sifting through contract negotiations, but I'm sorry you have to fly solo tonight. That's all right. Good luck with the sifting. Let me know if you need an emergency extra-large coffee sent your way. I will, thank you. Love you. - Love you too. - Have fun. - Mm. - It's gonna be great. Okay. Hi, guys. Hi, guys, I'm Molly. Hi, I'm Holly Martwell, and that's not my name. Hi, I'm Molly from Agency's content creation team, and I'm here to share with you a cool new series we're doing called, drum roll please, The Single's Guidebook, sponsored by Gal Pal Box. Anyway, I recently found myself single, and this series will help me bake... I mean, make the most of that. It's all about reclaiming your independence while spending some QT with yourself, so follow along as I try to figure this whole single thing out. If you want. Okay, thanks. Bye. This is for the promotion. This is for the promotion. This is for the promotion. Oh, okay. Yeah, thank you. Oh, sorry, I... Molly? Jackson. What are you doing here? Uh, here to take a gourmet cooking class for one, of course. What about you? Here to defend the Quiche Lorraine before the angry masses? I came from work and I'm here for work. I'm doing a new series for Agency. Ah, let me guess. Cooking but make it professional. It's basically a single's guidebook kind of thing. Oh, remind me to read up on that one. It's right up my alley. Well, new posts are going up daily. Okay. Uh... Oh, here, want me to take one? Uh, sure, that'd be great. Okay. Uh... Hold on. You're welcome. Wait, what are you... What are you doing? Posing for the photo. Well, that thing with your mouth. The... Oh, laughing photos get more engagement. Oh, oh, I didn't realize you were laughing. Okay. Thank you. All right. Hmm. One more? - Okay. - Thanks. Hey, uh, why was the snowman in the vegetable garden? Excuse me. It's a joke. Why was the snowman in the vegetable garden? It was picking its nose. You're welcome. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Gourmet Cooking for a Party of One. Make sure you've grabbed all required items from the counter over here. Uh... Uh, woops. Sorry. See, when I was younger, my dad had a sailboat and he would take us out sailing. - Hm. - Hm. Mm-hmm. You know, uh, I always like the one-handed crack. Yeah, just... Oh, okay, so you're a show-off. Thank you. Yeah, so, uh, as I was saying, about the sailboat... Is something burning? Uh, yeah, I think so. Anyway... - Jackson? - Uh, just a minute, Molly. Uh, there was something... - Jackson. - What's up, Molly? Uh, uh, your quiche is on fire. See, she thinks my cooking's on fire. No, it's on fire. - Yeah. - Oh, shoot, shoot. Uh... - Uh, fire! - Shoot. Uh... - Oh. Ooh! Ah! - Ah! Woo! Hi, everybody, I'm Jackson. And that's how it's done. Quiche Lorraine, everybody. So you do a lot of those things? Cooking classes? Uh, no, actually, that was my first one, believe it or not. Yeah, I believe it. No, I mean singles events. Yeah, they don't always end in disaster like that one. But I do know the single scene in this area backwards and forwards. I started doing them when I moved to Savannah as a way to meet new people. That was like five years ago and I'm still at it. Five years? Don't get me wrong, I met a lot of great people, just no one worth committing to yet. Or you're going about it all wrong. Oh, what do you mean? I saw you with that girl back there. You have no issues talking with people. That much is clear. Thank you very much. - But. - But. It felt like you were talking at her, not with her. What was her name? Meg-Sue-Johannah. Exactly. When dating, people want to feel invested in, not just smacked over the head with a good pick-up line. So my pick-up line was good? You're missing the point. No, I got the point, but I also got the compliment. You know, you don't strike me as the type of gal that would go to a singles cooking class. And what type am I? One with a five-year plan that's working out perfectly with a finance bro boyfriend who's about to propose. Nailed it, didn't I? Five-year plan, yes. Finance bro, not so much. He was in real estate, and we broke up earlier this week. Oh, plot twist. It's part of the reason why I got this series, because I'm single and have no hobbies. Which I don't think is fair, because when you love what you do, is work really even work? No, it's a hobby you're getting paid for, which means when I retire... And watching you spiral out of control is oddly amusing. Let me guess, you're the "See where the road takes me" kind of guy? Sure am. I couldn't imagine living my life with a color-coded day planner. I'd miss out on all the good stuff. Good stuff takes time and careful planning. No, see, in business, I agree with you. But in life, good stuff happens when you live in the moment. So, are you cool with me using the photos and videos from tonight for the Single's Guidebook thing? Yeah, sure. Well, thank you for your part in what turned out to be a surprisingly entertaining night. Well, I am happy to be of service. - Oh my gosh. - What? You guys are blowing up. People are loving it. I have to say, this is not what I expected, but it could be an interesting angle. What do you mean? Your solo stuff is a little flat, but this guy, what's his name? Jackson. I can't put my finger on it, but it works. You know, he's trending well with the male followers. It might be a good idea for you two to team up. This guy, uh... Jackson. Right, Jackson. Could be a good angle. Him trying to make a real connection while you're making the most of singlehood. Make it less of a how-to and more of a slice of life. What do you think? Well, he's not very on-brand. Right, but he's so off-brand that he's basically on-brand, you know what I mean? Find a way to get him on board. I mean, we'll compensate him for his time, of course, or tag him in the post. But just let me know what his terms are. Don't take no for an answer. What just happened? I think you have a partner for your Single's Guidebook series. Oh, hey, hey, Molly. I got your Planning for Your Future Retirement catalog. Ah, you can never be too prepared. Hey, uh, Jackson. - Yep? - Um... That new series I'm doing. The Single's Guidebook thing. Yes. I was wondering if you'd want to do that with me. With you? I'm really good at being single on my own. Right, which is why we'd focus on helping you make a real connection while teaching me how to be single. Look, honestly, finding quality singles events has been next to impossible. That's because you don't know where to look. Right, and you do. So, would you partner with me? I don't know, and show my whole dating life to the world on social media? Yeah, I don't know, that seems a little... Well, we wouldn't use your last name. And we'd make it fun. We would have to use your image, of course, but other than that, we'd share as much or as little as you want. Really, it's a win-win because I am an excellent wingwoman. - Oh, are you now? - Yes. I'm very smooth. And you said so yourself, you know the single scene backwards and forwards. Is that a no? It's a maybe. Tell you what. I'll do it on one condition. What's that? If I'm gonna expose my dating life for the whole world to see, I want separate promotions for my foundation, Arts Ed 4 Youth, unrelated to the series. - Like ads. - Yeah, sure. We got this big meeting coming up with an investor, and they don't think that our social media reach is very good. So, a couple ads from you guys would really be helpful. Well, I'll talk to my boss in the morning, but that should work out great. So, what do you say? Are you ready to leave the singles market once and for all? I don't know, are you ready to learn how to stand on your own two feet? I am. I can't believe I'm doing this. Okay, as am I. - Deal. - All right, I will text you tomorrow and we'll get started. Okay. Get ready. You haven't seen anything like this. Ever. - Good morning. - Morning. You're all good to go with Jackson. We can absolutely feature his nonprofit on our socials. I'll have Jessi and Reggie film some promos for you two. That would be great. Oh. - What's this? - Your Gal Pal Box. Pick some products in here to incorporate into your posts moving forward. And just a few notes. We really want something elevated, polished, personal. Make singlehood look glam, if you know what I mean. Yes, understood. Great. Oh, and Jenna is officially out of the running for the position. W... why? Well, her content wasn't quite what we expected for a full-time Agency content creator. Not elevated enough. Mm. I didn't realize you were making cuts as we go along. Oh, yes, we have no time to waste. We want that new person boarded next week. - Good luck. - Thanks. Hey. Hi. Uh... Here, I got you a latte. That was nice. Why a latte? Because you look like the kind of woman that drinks the same cup of coffee every day. I'll take that as a compliment. - So I was right. - Not exactly. I am a drip coffee, light cream. Good to know. I'm more of a two-and-a-half shots of espresso with sugar and soy milk on the bottom with almond foam and cinnamon sprinkles on top, just in case you ever need to know. - Noted. - So I was thinking that we just go for it, just really put ourselves out there. Skydiving. Running a 5K. Singles paintball tournament. You're kidding, right? No, you gotta push the limits, you know? Really test yourself. While that sounds dangerous, I do agree we need to do things that give great photo moments. Hence the paintball. I was thinking something more along the lines of a ballroom dance class. Boring. Ballroom is all technique. There's no passion. Okay, Mister Ideas, we do have some guidelines we have to work within. Regina wants polished, personal. So, sticking with the dance theme. - Salsa. - That was fast. Well, think about it, salsa is basically the language of love. Ballroom feels more on-brand. Salsa feels more exciting. You know what, let's settle this the old-fashioned way. Paper-Rock-Scissors. That's really how we're doing this? Yep. You're on. Mm-hmm. Boop. You can't boop me. Ah, I believe that that is a win for salsa. And I know just the place too. The chicks are really gonna dig these sweet moves. Oh, I am sure they will. Just, uh, don't wear that, okay? What's wrong with this? It looks like you've been riding cross-country in a rideshare situation for the past three days. So, I'm chill, relaxed, and ready for adventure? Wear a shirt with buttons, Jackson. I don't know if I own a shirt with buttons. I'll see you later. I was kidding. I own more shirts with buttons. Yep, I think. Well, that will be fun. Fun's not the goal. A stellar series for Agency is the goal. Well, maybe this'll become your thing. - My thing? - Yeah. Like what people know you as. The salsa dancing girl. It's kind of cool. I already have a thing. Content creation. Okay, we need to give your introduction to everyone. Just a quick who you are and why we're partnering up. - Ready? - Okay, yep. Hello, I'm Molly from the Single's Guidebook. Why are you talking like that? Like what? Like you're narrating an audiobook. That's not what I sound like. That's exactly what you sound like. "Hello, world, I'm Molly. Trying to get you to think that I'm cool." Let's go again. Hey, guys, I'm Molly from the Single's Guidebook. After the other night's cooking fail, I've taken it upon myself to help a fellow single, Jackson, the one who set the oven on fire. - Hey! - To help him meet someone and make a real connection. And I will teach Molly how to navigate the single scene and maybe have some fun while doing it. As long as there's no more fires. No promises. See, that was so much better. Okay, we'll go with it. All right. All right. All we have to do is... Feel the rhythm of the music. Ooh, save it for the class, Don Juan. Okay, in order to be the best wingwoman possible, I need to know three qualities you're looking for in a woman. Okay, she's gotta be fun, honest, and intelligent. Bonus points if she likes classic literature. Well, I'll be on the lookout for a woman holding a Jane Austen title while dancing. All right, and I'm gonna go check out the dance floor. Hey, guys, Molly here. About to try some salsa dancing. What am I doing? Hey, guys, Molly here. About to try some salsa dancing. Who... who am I? Um... Hey, guys, Molly here. At a salsa dancing class. I'm here with Jackson. And it looks like he's already made a connection. I will keep you updated. - Yeah, are you? - Actually, I'm here with a friend, but... Who was that? That was Heather. Single, never salsa-ed. All right, everyone, let's partner up and form two lines for our warmups across the floor. Okay, wingwoman, it's your job to get me partnered up with Heather. How am I supposed to do that? You said this is your domain. I mean, if not, I can go... No, no, get in line, I'll make it work. Okay, all right, pardon me, sir. Sorry. Ah, watch your back, excuse me, thank you. Whoa. Hey... Sorry. Sorry, sir. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, all right. I haven't seen anything like that. Sergio! Just in time. Raul, yes Oh, but he, uh... Guess that leaves us. I guess so. Uh... I'm sorry, I tried. I know... I know you did. I'm actually a little bit shocked. It would have worked if Rico Suave hadn't foiled my plan. Yeah. Okay, so, grab your partner's hand and begin. Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. And one, two, three. - I hate this. - Why? Because you're not automatically good at it. I think you're doing great. No, they're doing great. Don't compare yourself to other people, all right? Just do you. Nailed it. What just happened? I don't know... oh, we still need to get stuff for your series, right? Content of you dancing. - Oh... - So, uh... Hmm. Just dance or something, okay? And in three, two... No, it's five, six, seven, eight. Okay, whatever, I'm rolling. What are you... What are you doing? - Uh... - Just breathe. Relax and feel the music. Dance gracefully. You're a natural. There you go. - That is gold. - Okay. All right. God, you are a terrible dancer. Okay, have you ever seen yourself dance? Uh... not really, maybe... I was watching you. Okay, well, you want to try to dance some more? Shall we stay and... Okay, let's go. I can go find Heather. Oh. You gotta post that. It's good, real. My boss doesn't want real. She wants aspirational, polished personal, remember? Yeah, but what does Molly want? Social media is better when it's authentic. There's enough people out there trying to be perfect. The world doesn't need that. Says the guy who's not on social media. Yeah, well, at least I'm authentic. "Life is about embracing your imperfections, so here's to that. Oh, and that cute girl Jackson was talking to? Swept off her feet by a real-life romance novel character. More soon, M and J." Wow. Don't make a big deal out of it. Why? You didn't even have a filter on that. Don't make me delete this. You'd better not. James, I'm sorry. Good luck. Molly. Hey! Your post last night, not your best. Stick to the brief, okay? James, uh, what's James doing? Uh, he's cut. He's a great writer, but not enough charisma for our team. Anyway, it's just down to you and Sarah now. Oh, I was hoping I could run some ideas by you, you know, in case I get the spot. Sure. So I was thinking we could stick with the whole guidebook idea and create more content that helps users build a connection with themselves. Something along the lines of A Guide to Living Mindfully. Or Get to Know Your Creativity with journal prompts, some... How about Three Ways to Deepen Friendships? Uh... Easy Ways to Cook Kale? Oh, that last one was good. The goal is to make people believe that you have the secret to a better, happier life. That's how we sell products and ads. Sarah pitched some good stuff this morning. How to Wake Up Beautiful, Tricks to a Glowing Skin, that kind of thing. So what about things that could actually better people's lives? If it doesn't sell in our online boutique or it doesn't bring in ad dollars, it doesn't matter. That kale thing was good, though. We are getting ready to partner with a nontoxic cookware line, and that might be a solid fit. Would you just tell me what we're doing? ‚ô™ It's somebody... Oh, you've got to be kidding me. What screams, "I'm confident and good by myself" like belting one out in front of a room full of strangers? What product are you peddling this evening? Uh, peel and stick lipstick. How does that even work? I don't know. But it was in the box, so I had to shoot it. Well, then stage lights might be perfect lighting for said photo. Oh, come on, you got this. And if you don't, I'm right there beside you. Okay? Hey, come on, come on. Come on! It's a crowd favorite. ‚ô™ He rocks in the treetop all day long ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Hoppin' and a-boppin' and a-singin' his song ‚ô™ ‚ô™ All the little birds on J-Bird Street ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Rockin' Robin Okay, baby bird, it's your turn to fly. Oh, I really don't... I gotta get the perfect picture of you and I can't get it from up here. You got this. ‚ô™ Every little swallow, every chickadee ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Every little bird in the tall oak tree ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Wise old owl, big black crow ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Flappin' their wings saying go, go, go ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Rockin' Robin, tweet, tweet, tweet ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Rockin' Robin, tweet, tweedle-lee-dee ‚ô™ I have to say, I'm a little bit star-struck! That duet up there? You guys crushed it. Is she... Oh, no, she's just a friend. Neighbor. Friendly neighbor. Hi! - I'm Jackson. - I'm Ellie. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you! Um, this is my favorite spot. You ever come here a lot or... I've been around. Have you ever, uh... turned around? Have I what? Here. Had a cold drink? Good cold drink? Okay, um, it was nice to meet you! Good drink. What? Why would you throw me off like that? I was just getting in my flow. I was trying to get you to ask her about her as in what does she think of the cool specialty cocktail menu? Yeah, I never would've got that from, brr! But yeah, no, cool. Got it. Next time I'll know. I think I'm karaoke'd out. Are you hungry? I'm starving. I have always wanted to come here. You've never been to Food Truck Alley? Well, Lucas, my ex, he was more of the Michelin star with a seasonal taste menu kind of guy. Mm, sounds very posh. Well, I liked it because I thought I was supposed to like it. You know, we seemed sophisticated and grown up, but I think I was missing out on some good stuff. Well, I can say for certain that you definitely were. And now that your "we" has turned into just a "me"... Yeah, you know, I thought we met each other and it was good, so it was good enough, you know? Meet a great guy, get settled down, check! We'd been on cruise control for the past few years. Oh, that is my absolute nightmare, letting life happen to you instead of being intentional about it. Life is meant to be lived in drive, not cruise control. So you seem pretty good at putting yourself out there, not caring what other people think. What other people think about me is none of my business. I only care what I think about me. And you think you're great. Well, I am. Look, in all seriousness, it took me a long time to get here. I want to be a good example for the kids that I work with every day. They look up to Dave and me, and I never want them to feel like they have to be anything other than who they are, that they're good enough. What's going on? We were just tagged in a video. - What? - Several videos, actually, under the hashtag JacksonandMolly. Wow, we have hashtag fans. You don't have to say "hashtag." Why? It's hashtag fun. Okay, social media, yeah. Master! Okay, since this is your first time here, we gotta get the kitchen sink cheese fries and the bacon, uh... - bacon ice cream, yes. - We're on. We'll try those, okay? How you doing over there? You know, I didn't think cranberries and jalape√±os would work on cheese fries, but these are actually pretty good. You wanna try 'em? Sure, I'll have one. Mm! You know, it must be great to get paid to eat wild food and hang out with great company. I appreciate how you slipped yourself a compliment in there. You like that? So, have you been at the Foundation long? About four years. I love it. Getting to see the kids explore their creativity, uh, find something new, see what they're good at. You know, there's nothing like it. That's really cool what you do with them. I'm sure the ladies in the single scene love that. Well, I wouldn't know. It's not something I usually talk about. Why not? I don't know, it just seems too weird and deep and personal. Hmm, so that's your problem. What? You like to stay on the surface. You're afraid to actually open up to let somebody really see you. I am not. Mm, then why is talking about your work and how much you care for the kids too personal? Whatever, enough about me. How long have you been at Agency? Okay, we're just gonna put a pin in that, because that, my friend, was a breakthrough. Pin! But I've been at Agency for just under three years. I started off as an outside freelancer helping their regular team, and they liked what I did, so they brought me in and gave me a desk and assignments whenever they had extra space. Now, they're looking to bring another content creator on full-time. And you're in the running? Yeah, there's a few of us vying for the spot, but I'm hoping this series gives me what I need to show them I am ready for the position. That's why everything needs to be perfect. My main competitor, Sarah, her series is quite literally perfect. That is way overproduced. Nobody even looks like that in real life. Well, isn't that the point of social media? It's everybody's highlight reel. What do you want to put out there? Perfect is boring. Real is way more interesting. "Post-show cheese fries with everything you can think of and a cup of ice cream with bacon. Both very odd, both delicious. Say yes to the present moment and take a bite..." see what I did there? "Out of the things that challenge you. Swipe to see our epic karaoke performances and let me know what your favorite karaoke song is. Lip shade, Red Rose by Gal Pal Box." And post. That was almost as cheesy as those fries. These are a little bit more delicious, though. And spicy. Molly? Okay, so problem. Last night's post was a little... cringey? Cringey? Yeah. Um, keep the caption shorter, a little less of whatever that was. Go for polished personal. Relatable, but also aspirational. And don't overshare. So be fake. Not fake, just say a little less, keep it light and simple. Got it? If you need inspo, just look at Sarah's captions. Sorry I'm late. Oh, that's quite all right, dear! I was just catching up on some local events. They have flower market, they have a pottery workshop, a poetry reading, and coffee bean roasting class! That sounds cool, can I see that real fast? Thank you. So how did your bridge club craft day go? Well, Maggie was late as usual, and Lottie forgot it was her week to bring snacks. So it was not good? No. It was great! Marian ran next door and whipped up her three layer dip, and by the time Maggie finally showed up, she had this crazy story about her high school sweetheart's grandson pulling her over! I mean, what are the odds? They're going to dinner tomorrow. Mm! Okay. Did the crafting go well? It wasn't really all about the crafting, dear. It was about spending time with the people that I love. Did it go perfectly? No. But that's quite all right, because nothing in life ever goes according to plan no matter how hard you try. You know, it's all about those little moments. That's really good advice. Well, it took me years to learn. I used to get so upset if every little thing didn't go according to plan. And then I realized, I was missing out on some of the best moments of my life just trying to make things perfect. Perfect is just an illusion, dear. So, Regina gave us the go-ahead to post videos promoting the Foundation and the charity event and put them on Agency's socials. I was thinking that we break everything up into these three sections. Wow, you put a lot of work into this. Oh, that was the bare minimum. Now, the first one is just an introduction to you and the program, the second is the charity event, and the third is how to get involved and donate. Which, can you come into the office tomorrow to film? Yeah, sure. Great. Where are we going? Oh, it's my turn for the surprise. Okay. What are we doing here? A poetry reading. You said bonus points if she likes classic literature. What's more classic than Emily Dickinson and Oscar Wilde? I mean, nothing, I guess. Exactly. I told you I was a good wingwoman. Who are you and what have you done with Molly Hartwell? Man, poetry is my thing. No, it's not. Really? I minored in poetry in college. One of our assignments was to create a nonlinear poem out of an inanimate object and give it a full life. I chose glasses and titled it Nose Glass. That poem ended up in the school paper, so I might be a genius. Well, I also took a poetry class in college. Hm. We'll have to compare work sometime. You're on. I know this Willy Wonka creative mind of mine will take you very, very far. Just don't forget, I'm just Hollywood, and you're the star. Thank you, Hollywood. Okay, next up we have Molly Hartwell. You're up next. To dance is to live. To live is to love. To love is to transcend. There are no other words to live by but those that lead you to dance. Thank you. Thank you, Molly... Uh, it was very... inventive. "Inventive"? Yeah. And next up we have Jackson Merrington. Okay. Um. What can I say about these things? Mundane things? Like a cup of coffee on a cold morning or the sun reflecting off the dewdrops. Who am I to tell you about the beauty of your world? I am no one. But I hope you see it. Everywhere. Around you. Inside of you. It's been a great evening. We have one more reading tonight. Suzanne Johnson, you'll be our last poetry reader. What was that? I, uh, you know... Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Great job up there. These things, I love them, but sometimes you just never know what you're gonna get. Yeah, I hear you on that. But your reading was fantastic. Jaspen, right? I'm Cara, by the way. Oh, uh, Jackson, and, uh, yeah, Jaspen's my favorite. Um, what about you? What do you like about Jaspen? I did my senior thesis on him. Yeah. Oh, yeah? Where do you go to college? Oh, I went up at NYU. "Life's too short to take yourself too seriously and to not dance. Hashtag poetry. Oh, and Jackson may or may not have met someone. Stay tuned for updates." "Thanks, girl. Was nervous, but glad I did it." Great. Molly, your next product to promote! Thanks. And I saw your post last night. Poetry was mm, but push more on Jackson and that new girl. People loved it. They want more. Oh, hello! Hi. Jackson, hey! Hey. What are you wearing? What's wrong with it? Nothing! It just doesn't look like you. We're asking people for donations. People who do that wear ties. If it doesn't feel authentic, you shouldn't do it. So did you get that copy I emailed you this morning? Uh, no, I got it, yeah, it looks great. Great. So how was it? Uh, her name's Cara, into fashion, she actually has her own line. That's cool. Yeah, she likes poetry and traveling and this is the first girl I've met in a long time that I could see possible potential with. That's huge. Yeah, I gave her my number, said she'd... What? Oh, my gosh, she's calling me right now, what do I do? Answer it! Uh... Hey! Jackson? Uh, hey, Cara. Hey. I was just calling to say it was so great to meet you last night. Yeah, it was great to meet you too. Uh... Listen, uh, I was wondering if you wanted to go to a movie in the park with me tonight? Yeah, I think I can swing that. Text me the deets, okay? Bye, Jackson. You got it, dude! See you tonight! You nailed it. Until the end. Yeah, the end was a bit weird, right? But you have a date! Got a date. Oh, uh, Sammy, Sonya, I want you guys to meet somebody. This here is Molly. Hi! Are you guys ready to shoot? All right, can you move that just to the left, to the left? That's perfect, that's great, right there. If you guys will squeeze in just a little bit? Say cheese, say cheese! One more! Okay, you look great. So yeah, stay on your marks. Jackson, Molly, we're ready whenever you guys... - Oh, okay. - Yeah, sure. Just one second. And just a little bit of this. Okay, now you're ready. Okay, everybody ready? Yeah. Hey, if you guys get nervous, just look at me, okay? Okay. And three, two, one. Hi, I'm Jackson Merrington, Director of the non-profit Arts Ed 4 Youth. So, Sammy's amazing. Right? When he first came to us, he was struggling to focus in school. And then we tried a few different things, and then when we put him in front of the piano, he really lit up! That's really cool. Yeah, that's my favorite part about what we do, helping kids to connect to their creativity. You know, Sammy's focus and drive for learning piano has helped out in all the other areas of his life, too. I mean, the kid's basically got straight As now. All right. Did you bring your own clothes with you? Uh, no. This is what all the cool kids are wearing. Let's maybe try another one. How'd our poetry reading post do? Um, bit better than the other posts. Well, that's good, right? What? You said you wanted something different. The brief wasn't to take her to court. But I did pass the bar exam. Are you messing with me? Okay, one more. All right. Mm. I know what I'm doing tonight. You like it? I love it. Chic, but still you. Live from the Boutique on Main, Jackson is getting ready for his date tonight. How do we like the fit? He's going to a movie in the park with a fashion designer named Cara, and he is V excited, aren't you, Jackson? We will report back soon! Was that weird? What? Sharing all those details about the date. No, that's kinda the point of the series. Should we check out? Uh, yes, but I'm gonna get the suit, too. Just to be safe. Ooh, flowers are always a good idea. Wait, how do you know how to do all this? Oh, I did a whole series on DIY flower arrangements. No, I mean, the dating stuff, the restaurant suggestions, the flowers. It's like you're my dating fairy godmother. I told you I was a good wingwoman. Well, Agency is lucky to have you. You know, when I started at Agency, I was coming off of years of the freelance hustle. I think I was so excited to be in an office setting with a full-time client, I never stopped to consider if it's something I wanted long-term. Now with this full-time spot, I'm questioning myself, doubting, like I'm always one step behind. I felt that way before at the corporate data entry firm I was at before the non-profit. What was the issue? Just wasn't the right fit. No matter how hard I tried to fit in the company's box, I just couldn't do it. It wasn't until years later that I figured out that what I wanted to do was actually what I was meant to do. I don't know, I've been at Agency so long, I don't see how I'd switch gears at this point. Let me ask you a question. If you could do anything in the world, what would that be? Create content that is fun, relatable, and helps people. Content that connects, that forms friendships across digital platforms. My two cents? I know you're gonna give them to me whether I want them or not. You should never give up on your dreams, no matter what. And if Agency isn't it, then keep looking. You get one life. You shouldn't give it over to something you don't love with your whole heart. I'm a little freaked out by how deep and insightful that was. You're welcome. Here, these should be perfect. Okay. Oh, what, do you have a date tonight as well? These are for my grandma. Well, these are for you for being my wingwoman. Good luck tonight. You got this. I think you can officially add "wingwoman" to your resume. Right at the bottom. Just... So, while Jackson and Cara are out on their date, I am doing a little hashtag self-care. Will report back on this green algae purifying face mask by Gal Pal Box, and is this acceptable attire to wear to the grocery store? I feel like this might require some chocolate ice cream, and I am fresh out. I'm glad we decided to come here. It's a cool spot. - Yeah. - Um... You want to sit up front and watch it from up there? Not really. The eye strain alone will give me a migraine for like three days. Okay, yeah, I figure we could hang back here. So fashion, is that something you were always into? Yeah, pretty much. Speaking of, I'd love to dress you sometime, help you pick out some new pieces. These are fine, but I think we could find you something a little more elevated. Uh, yeah, cool, that'd be great. You know, I tend to dress more on the practical side 'cause I work with kids. They're my priority. They take up most of my time. Cute! But where are you on coffee? On? Like are you drip, latte, espresso? Um, I haven't really thought about it like that. Uh... I guess I just like it hot. I'm not really an iced coffee kind of guy. Okay, update. The mask felt weird, gross even, but it is 100% worth it! Oh, and Amy-bo-bamy, yes, I have tried the clay one. This was a thousand times better. The before. ‚ô™ All my treasures I get... - Thank God. - Okay. Well, that was good! Yeah, it was nice. Uh, you hungry? I know this great spot around the corner we can go. Oh, um, I'd love to, but I'm beat. Yeah, I have a big meeting tomorrow, so I need to get home. So rain check? Uh, yeah, sure. Okay, I'll give you a call and set something up, yeah? - Okay, yeah. - Thanks for a great night! Good movie. Molly? You okay in there? Jackson! Hi. What's going on in there? Oh, just doing some home improvement stuff. It's nothing. Sounded like a loud nothing. Yeah, I was trying to hang some curtains and then I saw these boxes from when I had an old roommate, and there's a bookshelf, but the curtains, I realized, you need a drill, not a hammer, to hang them. Oh, uh, you want some help? I've got a drill. I'll come back and I'll fix it, okay? No, I'll fix it! But with your drill. Okay. I'll be back in just a second. All right, now put some force behind it. I am! No, you're not. Put your weight into it. There you go, come on. Don't be afraid of it. I'm not. Well, you're sure acting like you are. Okay, well, I'm not. Yeah, oh, there you go! - All right! - Got it, okay. Uh... Hand me that. Okay, hold on. This one? Yeah. Okay, here, give me the drill. And just there. You know, they're not quite... Nope, they're great and I love them. Okay, on to the next one. There's more? Oh, we're just getting started. Great. Um... Eat up, Buttercup. You're home late. I take it the date went well? Yeah, it did. Uh... she's great. She had an important meeting in the morning, so we had to skip dinner. Skip dinner? Then why are you home so late? Oh, I was teaching Molly how to use power tools. At Molly's. Yeah, she wanted me to help her hang these curtains. You've been spending a lot of time together. It's for the series. Uh-huh. Anyway, I'm off to bed. - Good night. - All right. G'night, bro. So, you know that thing? That thing you've been putting off doing because it's too hard or too scary or whatever? Well, here's your sign to just do it. Everything is too scary until it's done, and my thing is this bookshelf that has just been sitting in its box in my living room. So, set you here. Are you ready for this? 'Cause I'm sure not. Sometimes, you just gotta know when to call it quits. Bookshelf, 1; Molly, 0. And a half. I'll get back to this tomorrow. Or the next day. Whatever. You know that thing? That thing you've been putting off doing because it's too hard or too scary or whatever? Everything is too scary until it's done, and my thing is this bookshelf that has just been sitting in its box in my living room. Molly, a word? Of course. I took down that bookshelf video. I wasn't quite sure where you were going with that. Authentic but still aspirational. Basically, polished personal. I mean, everyone struggles with building box furniture, right? So I figured it'd be a fun, unifying thing. Yeah, but it was... sloppy, and there was no product placement, and the engagement level was embarrassing. Look, um, I'm not really sure this is working. I'm thinking about pulling the plug... No, no. One more shot, please. I can do aspirational. I'm so aspirational. Jackson and Cara. You liked the stuff with Jackson and Cara, right? Yeah. Well, Jackson has his charity event later. I can make my next post all about them, their relationship details, photos of the fancy outfits, the works. Okay. People do love love. I'll get the engagement back up. I promise. Last chance. Oh, hi. Wow, you clean up nice. You don't look so bad yourself. Yeah, I'm becoming a shirt-with-buttons kinda guy. Sorry. Can I steal him for a sec? Of course. So, things seem to be going well with you and Jackson. I mean, yeah, it's been fun. Um, I hear he really likes you. It's just a casual thing, he knows that. Oh. Babe, hi! Oh, I miss you too. I'm good. I'm just at this thing. Why? What's up? Oh yeah? I think I can swing that. Text me the deets? Okay. Bye. So, I don't know how to ask this... chill-ly? But are you seeing other guys besides Jackson? Why? It's not like Jackson and I are exclusive. Does Jackson know that? We never said we were exclusive! Game plan. Mark. This is my brother, Jackson. Ah, thank you for coming, Mr. Larson. Of course. My partners and I were just talking about how impressed we are that you were able to partner with Agency. That's not usually our cup of tea, but the videos that they put out for you guys are really well produced. The only thing we're concerned about is the personal angle. Uh, personal angle? Yeah. This dating-series thing feels a bit lowbrow. We don't usually recommend our organizations make light of their nonprofits. Oh, well, I can be done with that series. I was just doing it to raise awareness for this event. By putting your personal life out there? Well, we all gotta start somewhere. But I can be done with it. I'm sure that Molly would understand. I'll let her know as soon as we're done here. Right. As soon as you put a button on that, we can move forward with this partnership. Thank you so much, Mr. Larson. We look forward to working with you. Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Hey, guys. First of all, how much do we love these earrings? They're new, by Gal Pal Box. Okay, I need some advice. What would you do if you knew the girl your friend was seeing was also seeing other people? Would you tell him or just leave it alone? Obviously, I'm talking about Jackson and Cara. Let me know in the comments below. Keep you updated. Oh, Jackson! Hey. Where's Cara? Oh, uh, she, uh, had an emergency with some sort of Egyptian cotton and bamboo. Oh. What? Um, Jackson, there's something I need to tell you. Oh, good, 'cause I've gotta talk to you as well. But, uh, ladies first. Cara's seeing other people. Other guys besides you. What? Why would you think that? She didn't have an emergency with Egyptian cotton and bamboo. She got invited to another party. She wouldn't do that. I heard the whole thing. So you eavesdropped on her private conversation? No, not intentionally, I... Look, if you don't believe me, just call her. Okay, I will. And you can listen. What's up? Hey, Cara. Um... I was just having a conversation with Molly... Jackson, I've told you, like, eight times that that girl has feelings for you. It's all over her face and posts, and you just need to let her down gently if you're not into it. She's a sweet girl. I know... I'm coming, I'm coming. Look, babe, I've gotta run. Um. See you at Leno's tomorrow, yeah? No. We don't have plans tomorrow, babe. Cara? You think I have feelings for you? Well, the thought crossed my mind. And what makes you think that? You did try to sabotage the dance date. That was the real-life Rico Suave. Yeah, and then, at karaoke, your gestures. You were trying to throw me off my game. I was trying to move the conversation along. Well, it doesn't look like that, looking back on it now. You are so full of yourself. I'm full of myself? You're the one that's so consumed with trying to be perfect, you've forgotten who you are, Molly. That bookshelf video you posted? It was real and charming. But then you deleted it. No, I didn't delete that. Okay. You know, this whole Single's Guidebook thing was supposed to be about you learning to stand on your own. But instead, you acted happy to sell products and get likes from strangers. You don't even like your job. You pretend to because you don't realize you have another option. And what's that? Run away from anything real, like you do? You know... you're actually not letting anyone in, Molly. And you are? You're seeing a girl who's seeing other people. She's not seeing other people. You didn't even ask. Because that would constitute as deep and be too much for you. Okay. I think we're done here. More than. Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Oh, crap. Regina, hi! Molly. I just found the livestream, and... Right. I just stopped it. I'm deleting it now. No, no, no, don't! Wait, what? I asked for drama, and you gave me drama. This series has turned into our own little soap opera. I was gonna pull the plug on this tomorrow morning because it wasn't working, but this angle is so good, the video stays up. I don't know, I... Molly. This is the first time your video has spiked on the engagement ratings this whole time. The video stays up. Oh! Jackson. Hey. Hey. Uh... Uh... I'm so full of myself? You're the one that's so consumed with trying to be perfect, you've forgotten who you are, Molly. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're putting that in upside down. Thank you. What's going on? Nothing. This is not nothing. This is Jessica Waters beat you out for the editor spot junior year-level mad. I hate how well you know me. What's up? Jackson and I got into a fight last night. I know. I saw the livestream. What? It was really... salacious. Your engagement is through the roof. Uggh. Why are you not thrilled about that? I don't know, I... I think that was crossing some line. I feel weird that it's still up. Well, what do you care, if if gets you the full-time spot? I just... Jackson was right. I have been fake, really stinkin' fake, trying to fit into this box Regina wants me to, and... Oh my gosh. What? You do have feelings for him! What? No! That's not even what I was... Plus, why would it matter if I did? Well, I'm pretty sure all of Agency's half a million followers would like to know the answer to that question, me included. He's with Cara. People have a love triangle. No! Nope. I am staying out of their business. Jackson's goal was to meet someone, which he did, so his job here is done. And you're just gonna leave it at that? Yeah! Yeah. I don't need to mess with other people's lives anymore. I think I've done enough of that. I don't know how Regina's gonna feel about that. Yeah. Me neither. Hey. I thought you ended things with Molly and the Single's Guidebook. - I did. - Not according to this. You're the one that's so consumed with trying to be perfect, you've forgotten who you are, Molly. Has Mark seen this? I don't know. But you'd better find a way to take it down. I'll be back. Yeah. Congratulations. Well deserved. Mm, now if you'll excuse me. What's that all about? Congratulations! Full-time offers went out. The board opted to bring both you and Sarah on. Both of you showed fantastic potential on your assignments. And they want to feature your series as a permanent fixture on the site. Welcome to the team, Molly Hartwell! I... I don't know what to say. Uh... you could say you accept. I don't know if I can do that. What? Why not? We literally created this position for you. I don't think Agency's the right fit for me. I don't want to work for a company that makes me feel like I have to change who I am to fit in. What? Okay, where is this coming from? I should've deleted that livestream as soon as I realized it had been posted. And I should've stood up for myself when you deleted that bookshelf video. Creating content shouldn't be about selling products or getting likes. It should be about connecting with people. Creating meaningful interactions. And that's not what happens here. So... I quit. What? Thank you for everything, Regina. Working here has been an invaluable experience. Wow, uh... you're still under contract, so you need to do your last post for the series. Okay. I will do my one last post, and then I'm done. Mark! Jackson. I'm glad I caught you. Listen. What I saw last night was fantastic. You guys have a great organization with a fantastic message. Oh, thank you, sir. We've put years of effort into it. With that being said, my partners have opted to go in a different direction. The team is a bit put off by what we've seen on social media recently. Think it's a bit too much bad PR. We don't want to bring on a brand that needs a bit of cleanup at this time. Right, okay, about that. See... I'm sorry, Jackson. The decision's been made. It was a pleasure meeting you. Jackson! Why would you do that? Oh, I can explain... Really? Because it looks like you put our private conversation on your company's account, and for what? Sympathy? Engagement? Jackson, listen... This isn't a joke to me, Molly. This is my real life, and it just cost us the investor. He pulled out because of your little stunt. It wasn't a stunt. I was just doing what Regina was asking me to do to get the full-time spot, and... Well, I hope it was worth it. Jackson. Jackson, wait. Take a hint, Molly. I don't have anything else to say to you right now. I messed it up. I messed absolutely everything up. You did cause quite a doozy for yourself. Anything that can be done can be undone. And I would start by taking that post down. I'm not authorized to do that. Says who? You don't work for them anymore. I do have one more post I need to make for them. So do it right. Put out a post with content that you know that your readers and Jackson deserve. That's terrifying. More terrifying than losing what you and Jackson have? The recent change I've seen in you has been something special. Jackson challenges you and he pushes you out of your comfort zone, helps you grow in ways I have never seen before. That's worth holding on to. What's this? Little something I thought you'd like. Thanks, Gran. Remember. Life always works out exactly the way it should. Mr. Larson? Your next appointment's here. Send them in. Ah! Please have a seat, Miss... You can just call me Molly. Do you have a minute to talk about Jackson Merrington and the Arts Ed 4 Youth program? Hey. Anything for me? Not today. "Quiet your mind, listen to your heart. Grandma." Uh, thank you, and if you change your mind, please let us know. Okay, that's a no-go on the Gregsons. Who's up on our potential investor list next? Jackson. I'm a little busy here, Dave, trying to save our foundation. Well, you might wanna put pause on that. Why? Larson's on his way here to discuss a possible partnership. What? How? I don't know. But he could literally be here any minute. Gentlemen. How good to see you both. Hi! Uh, please, take a seat. Thank you, sir. I really appreciate this. Hoo boy. What are you gonna do? I mean, I don't know. Agency's been my life for the past three years. Without it, I... I mean, about Jackson? Oh, that. He's one of the best people I've ever met. I felt more myself with him than I have in a long time. He challenged me, he wouldn't let me give up, even when I wanted to, which I needed, and he achieved his goal. He met someone, and I'm happy he's exploring that. You're happy. Thrilled. Okay. Any thoughts on your last Agency post yet? You're supposed to go live by tonight, right? I have a few. Can I have a hint? The hint is... Shh! - Sorry. - Sorry. And after Miss Hartwell explained everything to me, I realized we made an error. I... I'm sorry, what? We want to work with the foundation. Right, I got that part. Uh, but you said Molly? Oh. She came by my office, shared the situation, how you and she were creating this Single's Guidebook thing, but it was the Agency's orchestrating, and that she was taking the post down. She presented a really great social media strategy for us moving forward, ways to capitalize on this partnership you had with the Agency, with integrity. She also suggested a whole plan with other potential partners and avenues for growth for Arts Ed 4 Youth's online potential. She made quite a compelling pitch for why we should partner with you. And, uh, we think she's right. Listen, I got another meeting, but I'll have my office send over the paperwork. We're very excited to work with you both. Hey, guys. I'm sitting here in Forsythe Park. It's stunning, take a look. Anyway, I just wanted to hop on here and say a quick thank-you before we officially end the series. You might have noticed some of the posts were taken down. That's because I feel like we strayed a little far from the original aim. Starting this series was low-key terrifying. I was a newly single workaholic who never gave herself a moment of downtime. I realized that this was so I wouldn't have to take a real look at my life at who I was and what I wanted. When I started this series, I wasn't looking for love in any way. But I learned that love comes in many forms. Love for your friends, love for new skills, love for yourself, for your struggles and your journey. Okay, that sounded cheesy, but stay with me. I learned that what I was looking for was my own kind of love. Oh, and Jackson, he found what he was looking for too. So, consider this the end of the Single's Guidebook, sponsored by Gal Pal Box, but I will be unofficially continuing the series under a new handle, Life with Molly, where you can keep watching me try things like take a cooking class or build bookshelves and whatever else you want to see. Anyway, thank you for being on this journey with me. Working with Jackson was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Hello? Is this Molly Hartwell? This is she. Hi, my name is Veronica Greenburg, with Greenburg Publishing. Is this a good time? Uh, sure. Great. So we've been following your work on the Single's Guidebook series, and we love your voice and authenticity. If you're open to it, we'd love to chat with you about a book deal to expand on your series. We've already run it by the Agency and they signed off on you doing it. Wait. Are you serious? Very much so. Now-or-never moment, dude. You got this. Honey, I am so proud of you. Thank you, Grandma. But what about Jack? What does he think? Oh, um, I don't know. We're still not talking. That's because we haven't had time. What are you doing here? Mark Larson came to see us. Turns out he's gonna invest. That's great. Yeah, you must have made quite the impression on him, so I wanted to say thank you. It's the least I could do. Jackson, I'm so sorry. I never should have left that livestream up. I was in my head about the full-time spot and I got tunnel vision and lost sight of why we were doing the series in the first place. Why is that? Well, so I could learn to enjoy my singledom and you could meet someone. Which I did and you did. Yeah, about that, uh... Cara and I decided to end things. Oh. Sorry. No, it's okay, because... I met someone else. You did? Yeah. Someone that I really, really like. And it's real. Like, real real. Like something I never experienced before, and that scares me. Well, maybe she feels the same way. - Yeah. I hope so. - Wonderful, see you then. Wait. Are you talking about me? 'Cause I'm definitely talking about you. Of course I am. Okay, good.
