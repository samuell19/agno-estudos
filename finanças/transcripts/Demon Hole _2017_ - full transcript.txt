Abie. Hello? Hello? Ab-bie. Abbie. You're listening to WRCK Radio 104.5, where we've got all the greatest hits and news all the time. Hope you're staying warm on this brisk night. Here's what's happening around you. After a tense week, Ohio reps have voted to open more state land for fracking. We know firsthand the devastation that working the land this way can do. Frack, baby, frack. I just sold gas rights to my mama's place, and now I'm buying a Porsche. You're listening to WRCK Radio 104.5. Don't fucking touch me. Luce, it's me. The baby's asleep. Listen. Your stash isn't up here anymore. I found it. We're not going to have any drugs in this house. Luce, you won't have to come here, you won't have to steal here anymore. You can come home. We love you, Luce. Luce, I'm not going to hurt you, but we worry about you on the street with no food. Luce, I know you don't trust me, but I'm just a very affectionate person. Don't fucking touch me. I'll fucking touch you. You walking around like you do in your little fucking shorts, your little fucking slutty tang. You're telling me you don't fucking want it, you little, stupid slut? Fuck you. Oh. God. Fuck you. Shh. The baby's sleeping. Jimmy. Jimmy. Oh, Jesus, Jimmy. What the fuck? You crazy? I thought you were dead. Lenny came by and offered me a friend price. You want some? You know I don't touch that shit. Oh, got any pop? No, I don't have any pop. I just need a place to crash. Bobbi! I'm just doing community service, Mom. I'm not going to prison. I know. It's just community service. Yeah, this spaz. I don't want to hear any more about how I'm Daddy's little princess if you can't even get me out of community service. It's so humiliating, like I'm just some dangerous drunk driver. Pretty cold, yeah? I'm nervous. Do we not give you enough allowance? This is very confusing. Maybe you could explain this to us. The judge said permanent record next time. It's not like everyone else isn't doing it, Dad. Everyone else ain't black, Doug. Lucinda Smith. Luce. You know the drill - no guns, no knives, no phones. Hey, Luce. Hey, where's your dad? He still owes me for the OSU game. Done? So you're telling me I have to do community service because I'm black? Well, you've got to go now, so we'll talk about this later with a therapist. What's up, bro? What are you doing here? It's a long story. Shouldn't even be here. Put your arms up. I'm sorry. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. Get on the bus. So, Kyle, where you going to school? Harvard. Yeah? Really? I thought you wanted to play football. PAC 12, baby. Harvard has football. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Look, I'm not trying to tell you how to play football or anything like that, but you needed to go long. Know what I'm saying? Yeah? Yeah. DeMarco was open half the time you were getting blitzed. DeMarco is good at getting open, but he's also bad at catching. What are you going to do? Am I right? I mean, maybe if your pocket wouldn't collapse so fast, you could have got down field for big yard damage. Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! All right, listen up. This land has reverted to the State under the 200-year Treaty of the Screaming Turtles by the indigenous tribe the Hokadena Indians. Now, I want you to clear a trail through there. And, remember, this is ancient, sacred Indian land, so don't fuck around. Is it going to be a park or something? Kyle's dad bought the mineral rights, so he's going to frack it into a giant gas-producing asshole. Ew. Wait. So Kyle's dad also owns the correctional facility? Yep. So he's using our forced community service to clear his land? America, baby. Free enterprise. More like slave enterprise. Now go. Hey, I recognize you. You were the prom photographer. Really? We're just going to sit down? Dude, are you serious? I have glaucoma. I have a prescription. Ooh, I have that too. Can I hit that? Tell him, Kyle, how many times we've partied together. But he's a cop now. Yo, I'm only down here because I got busted for smoking weed. What if homeboy comes back down here? His dad is homeboy's boss. I don't get any service out here. How did you smuggle that? Let's just say if he was going to find it, I'd make him take me to dinner and a movie first. You guys are going to get me thrown in jail. Yo, where are we? I don't know, but this isn't where we were. Then the bus has got to be around here somewhere. You're supposed to know this shit. Did you get service yet? No, but I can still take selfies. Hey, y'all, just kicking it back nature style. Here. Hold this. Shit. Hey, y'all, just hanging around. Just hanging. Can you see my feet? Does it look like I'm in the tree? Hey, y'all, just hanging out, hanging. Wait. Wait. Wait. Go back. Hold on. Do it again. I can see the ground. Shut up both of you. Come on. We're totally lost. Kyle, we're in your custody. What do we do? I'm not a cop. I just work for my dad to pad my resume. Oh. Yeah, but you're rich, and you're going to Harvard. I nominate him too. That makes him a survival expert? Have you guys ever seen that show where the guy has to survive in the wilderness all by himself? The first thing he does is he sets traps for food. Then he forages for berries and starts saving his piss. This is why you don't have any friends, Gary. You don't know when to shut your mouth. Fine. Do what you want. But when you guys are dying of thirst, don't think I'm going to share mine. I vote the nerd has to keep his mouth shut. My dad hired a geologist. There should be a drill site out here somewhere. We should look for that. Shh. Hey, guys, we're not alone. Yeah, we should keep moving. Come on. Let's move. When is your dad going to start looking for us, Kyle? Does he have a helicopter? Agh! I'm fine. What is this? What is it, Kyle? I don't know. I think it's an alarm. Oh. Yeah, but what is it doing here? Hey, guys, check it out. It's a cabin. I don't want a cabin. I want a road. With cars, you know, that could take us to houses - my house. Yo, what is this doing here? What's a cabin in the woods doing in the woods? I'm not going in there. Ew. Ugh. Excuse me. Bitch. We must have stumbled onto somebody else's property. Yeah, I would say so. Yo, this is a drug den. At least I'm not drinking urine. Check this out. This is a Scorpio XL-500 II record player. Nerd. Fun fact about these. In 1983, the transistors for them were made almost completely interchangeable. Nerd. They - the - when - -Nerd. Blown capacitors. Yo, what could you have possibly done to get community service? I made a list of - of all the people that I - I hate, and the school found it and thought I was going to go Columbine. Was I on the list? Was I on the list? It was a pretty long list. Um, I don't think you can - maybe somewhere towards the end. That is really fucked up. Yeah? What did you do? Me? Uh-huh. Okay. I stole a skirt. Big fucking deal. It's not like a huge thing. It's not like I made a murder list. What's your excuse? You're a rebel? Yeah, I'm a rebel. I rebelled against my foster dad who tried to touch me, so I stole his car for a place to sleep. Ew. Yikes. Fuck this. I'm out of here. Ew. Anybody got papers? I do. Luce! Luce! Luce! Hey, Luce? Oh. Hey, Tiff, what's up? You okay? Kyle, that is so sweet. I, uh - what is that? We are so going to fuck later. I - I didn't do that. What do you mean? Man, it must be the weed, but I feel so relaxed. I'm usually so nervous. Oh. Hey, guys, did you hear that? Kyle... Hey! Whoa. What are you doing out here? I was going to go look for you. Well, I've been hiking in the woods for hours. I can't find a way out. I'm glad you're back. It's warm inside. Why don't we head on in? What's up, girl? Looks like I need to catch up. Did you - did you see anything while you were out there? Yeah, I saw a booby trap. You said booby. You mean like a secret device that's meant to kill people? Yeah, I mean a hole full of spikes. You know what, just pass me a joint. All right, Gary, get it going. Come dance with me... No, no. I can't. I can't. I really want you to, though. I can't. I'm sorry. Okay. What? You know, when I was in the woods, I found a cave. It's strange, but it sounded like someone was in there, like they were calling my name or something. Let's tell ghost stories or something. Hmm, scary. I'll go first. I am Molok. I have all knowledge. One of you will have great power. What happened? That's not scary. Yeah. I agree. Oh, yeah? Then what's scary? The real shit. Like I know a girl whose parents kept her in a shed behind the house. Like the people that are closest to you are the monsters. Like who? Your foster dad? Oh, snap. Or wait, wait, like - or like the time your mom told you Child Services was going to take you to a circus. Tiff, ease up, will you? How did you know that? How did I know what? About my mom told me that. How did you know that? I never told anyone that. That's not true. You told your first boyfriend, and he laughed. What the fuck is going on? How do you know that? I think I can read your mind. No, seriously. Oh, my God, I can read your mind. Bullshit. If can you read my mind, what number am I thinking right now? 247. Damn. Oh, shit. I am so high. Fuck, yeah, I can read minds for real. No, you can't. Take that. Can you tell what I'm thinking? Gary. Are you serious? Awkward. Tiff, wait. I don't know why you're so jealous. We're not even going out. I'm not sticking around if that bitch can read my mind. What? Doug, I can see through you. What? God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what is happening to me? I think you're so sweet and nice, and I really like you. I know you're lying to me. I'm not. Where's Doug? What's up, Kyle? Kind of fucked up, right? How - how did you - - Yeah, well, Doug has invisibility. And as for me, I'm not a nerd anymore, Kyle. I came here to do community service. Maybe I - I fell. Maybe - maybe I hit my head. What is that? We should just go to bed early and wake up first thing in the morning and leave. Don't act like you're not scared. You're just as scared as the rest of us. I think we're going to get through this. Of course we are. I'm so scared. Will you hold me? Hey, Tiff, the house is on fire. There's something out there. There's nothing to be afraid about. We're in this together. That feels so good, Doug. You know, I always liked you. What is it? Did I do something wrong? Oh, I - no, I just, you know I wonder what the others are doing. Is it because of what they said at school? What do they say at school? You know, the usual stuff. "Oh, she's really pretty and everything, but she's a total slut." I've never heard of that before. You didn't hear that everybody says I like really kinky sex, like the dirtier the better? I just - I don't want you to hold it against me. Oh, I - I don't judge. Hey, Tiff. You think I'm pretty, don't you? Kyle doesn't think so. Sometimes it really sucks being able to read minds. He likes Luce. Shh. Don't. Are you serious? Yes. And now you know. I know our friends don't really get along, but - -I like you, Kyle. I'm just awkward at this. Awkward at what? This first-move type stuff. That's okay. I'm not. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, come on, baby. Oh, yes. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I've got to get the fuck out of here. Hey, Doug. Can I use that? Hey, what's up, bro? I just made out with Luce. Hey, bro, I just had sex with a demon. So that happened. I'm going to go walk it off. Oh, come on, man, Bef's not that bad. Luce. Luce. Luce. Luce. Hey, what's going on? You okay? It felt so real. What? What felt so real? I think this house is haunted. I'm here now. I'll stay with you until the morning. Hey. Where's Doug? Yo, Doug! Doug! Doug! Why would he go outside by himself? I mean - - To just leave in the middle of the night like that, it's crazy. Look. Wow, great. I look fat. Whatever. What is that? It's got to be one of us, right? We were all in the cabin. Not all of us. Luce was outside. Remember? It's not me. Yeah. What is that? That's it. That's the drill site. Hey, we're home free. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is going on? Obviously they were murdered, guys. I think we should keep moving. Yeah. There might be a telephone in there. I'm going to go in. We've got to go. Shut up, Kyle. I'm going in. Fine. Hello. What happened? What happened? Yo, Bef, you okay? One, two, three. Oh. Oh, shit. Why are we carrying him around? Why don't we just kill him? Because he's the only one that knows what's going on. Hey, guys, where is the cabin? I recognize this place. It's gone. Oh, shit, dude, how does a fucking cabin disappear? Because if it's never there. Hey, who are you? I guard the cave. Maybe if you tell us what happened we could help you. I've - I've been wandering around these woods for the last couple of weeks. I - I don't know. It might have been hours, man. It's impossible to tell. The demon, he screws with you. He - he fucks with your mind, your - your sense of time, your sense of reality. Now, the sonar picked up an old Indian well. There's at least five major deposits down there, all accessible through this hole. And how big are those deposits? It's seven miles down. That's impossible. It took 24 years for the Soviets to drill down seven miles. To do this by hand would take thousands of years. We were out here drilling for some rich motherfucker. I don't know who it is. In 1994, Russia shut down its Kola Superdeep Borehole in Siberia. Remember? Uh-huh. Yeah. They started getting acoustic anomalies at about 35,000 feet, same depth as us. So we dropped a mic down there. What did you hear? That's the live feed off the mic. Yeah, you - you're working for my dad. That's your dad? Yeah. Fuck your dad. Motherfucker. I can't read his mind. Yeah, no shit. Why? You probably all think you have superpowers, but you don't. It's an illusion to trick you into the hole. Hole? The demon must have called to the Indians. They dug and dug for thousands of years, generation after generation. Crazy. And finally when they realized they had opened the doorway to hell, they tried to seal it with a sacred stone. If you go into the hole, Molok will take your body and use it as a vessel to enter our world. This guy's full of shit. How can you tell who's a demon and who's not? I can't. I just kill everybody before he gets his hands on me. My grandmother used to speak of it, a spirit from before the time of Moses, Molok, trapped not in the land of Israel, but here, in these woods. Bobbi! One of our workers went missing, so I went looking for her. So, then, tell us what to do. That fracking site that you passed on the way up here, in the doghouse there's a box full of explosives. If you can get it in the hole, blow it. You can close the well. Blow it? This is crazy. I'm not doing that. Yeah, it is crazy. All right, you know, you can sit around, and that's fine, but I'm not going to. I'll do it myself. Luce, wait up. Alright... - bye. Great. So we're just going to sit here and wait? Okay, listen, while they're blowing up holes, you should go get help. Maybe we should go get help, or we should stay here. Please? You know, I got it. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go get help. You stay here. Okay? You sit tight. I'm getting help. Bye. You say it needs a human host. Why? Have you seen that thing? Why does he want to come out so bad? Why are you so curious? Power. Great power. Yeah. He's going to take your soul. You can't have everything. What? You hear that? What you doing with them rocks? What you doing with them I'm trying to save you. Bitch, I'm trying to save your soul. I guess that's where you and I - -Yeah? We're a little bit different. Well, do it. Do it. fucking bitch. You fucking - oh, you weak bitch. Do it again the right way, bitch! Do it again. Do it -. Oh, fuck. Fucking bitch. You can't even get the fucking job done. Kyle. Kyle. Kyle! There's something out here, and it's calling my name. Yeah. It was that thing in the well that that guy was talking about. We need to blow it. Listen, Luce, there are billions of dollars out here. I mean, did you see the charts of natural gas on the computer? The gas, the well, it's real. Do you understand that? We need to think about this. No. We're blowing it up. I know you're there. You going to do something? Tiffany. Tiffany. What the fuck are you doing scary? Where is fucking Kyle. Where's Kyle right now? He's not in the fucking woods- he doesn't even fucking like me. Shouldn't - okay. Okay. Okay. Whoa, okay. Shit. Okay. Okay. Shh... I need your help. Someone's trying to kill me, Gary. Wait. How do you know my name? There's only way out. There's a hole in the cave, and I need you to take me. I'm going to be honest with you, I don't love that idea. I just - I'm not really you seem super nice. I can show you what it's like to be with a real woman. That sounds amazing and - and - and I - you are sweet. Stop. Don't you touch those titties. She's not real, son. You have to kill him. I already fucking killed her. Liar! Son, son, listen. Okay? You're just scared. I know, I know. I know you're a good kid. Put the stick down. Come on. I'm so nervous. This is - this is not your thing. Come on. Come on, just come over to this side. I know you're just a little frightened. Come on. I'm so nervous. I know. Come on. All right? You all right? I told you, bitch, I'm going to fucking kill everybody. You are not getting out of these woods. We'll see. I'm sorry, son. I'm sorry, but it's got to be this way. Coming to fucking get you, Molok. Come to me. Master, ...make me okay. Molok! Molok! I'm sick of your shit, motherfucker! I'm sick of your bullshit and the illusions! You fight like a bitch! You want to go? I'm right here. Come get me mano a mano, motherfucker! Gary... Motherfucker, let's go! Luce. What? You sure you want to do this? You didn't see what I saw at that drill site. Here. Take the detonator. Let's get out of here before we set that thing off. I can't do it. What are you talking about? It isn't about you. And it's definitely not about us. It's bigger than that. It's about money. You've got to be kidding me. Give me the detonator, Kyle. No. I said give me the detonator. You and me are going to be so good together. Give me the detonator. Oh, Fuck! Oh, God! Stay here. I've got this. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You okay? Who are you? Where did you come from? They're dead. They're all dead. You've been through quite an ordeal. I'm Richard Valis. I'm Kyle's father. I'm sorry. Oh, shh. No, no, no, no. The most important thing is your health. You got it? Can I get a little help over here? I want this shit cleaned up. I've got another crew coming in. I want this drill site up and running in 24 hours. You got it? All right. Got a problem with that? No. Good. Because if you do, I'll call the governor. One more thing. Don't say shit about the girl. Hey, Luce. Shh. You're alive. Kind of. But what about the cave? The explosion? That was an illusion.
