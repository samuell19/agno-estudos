Don't argue with a man who just looked death in the face. I know things. Wesley, don't let anybody look down on you because you're young. You set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and purity. You ever heard that? No, sir. Well, you look it up, because you're doing that. You are setting the example. That's what I wanted to say. The end. I'm done. I hope you get better, Mr. Wells. Call me Billy, for crying out loud. Okay, okay. Fine. Billy. Pray for me, okay?

(sighs) I'm sure it is, but if they would just have their parents come in and fill out the paperwork and do the things that they need to... I'm not sure how far this will go, but can you please use this to pay off all the kids' lunch debt? Where'd you get that? Just take it. And please don't be so mean to hungry kids.

No. (crying): I'm so sorry. (both crying) I'm sorry. It's time. CONLIN (voice-over): "But Jesus called the children "to Him and said, "'Let the little children come to me, "'and do not hinder them, "for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.' "Truly I tell you, "anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." (knocking) (door squeaks open) Pastor Conlin sent this over. What is this? - Oh, it's nothing. - Wesley, this looks like people's prayer requests. Why do you have these? I told you, it's nothing. I buried my daughter today. I have nothing, nothing left for this. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, okay? Why do you have these? This is proof that God did nothing to help Mallory. It's proof that prayer is a stupid joke that keeps stupid people from taking responsibility for their own lives. It's proof that He doesn't see us, He's not coming, and that He doesn't even care. You did this? You answered all these people's prayers? Why? Why would you do this? Promised Mallory I'd get God's attention. I promised her that I'd get Him to notice us, so I did His job for Him. I did Pastor Conlin's job, too. I answered all of these requests, making people think that God was listening. (scoffs) I got all these people coming back to church, thinking that He was, you know, helping and caring. Wesley, come here. You have to tell people what you've done. I will never go back to that church. You're a good son, and you were the best brother, but you're not a liar. And you may have had your reasons, but these people-- they deserve the truth. Why does anything matter at this point? It doesn't matter anymore. That's for them to decide what matters. They won't understand why I did this. I don't even understand why I did any of this. Thanks for meeting me out here. I figured you could use a little break. Thanks. And maybe a friend. I was only four years old when my dad died. I was so young that I don't know which of my memories are real, and which are just stories I've always heard. So I don't pretend to know what it's like... (sighs) Please don't. I really can't handle an inspiring lecture right now. Just don't. No lecture, but watching your sister die-- you'll never get over it, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. Please, Wesley, talk to me. Fine. You want to talk? Well, then I got a question for you. Do you still hate God? Will I always hate Him? That's what I really want to know. God didn't kill my dad. Didn't keep him alive, either. No, but if nothing bad ever happened, how would I really know that I could trust Him to take care of me? He did, you know. He took care of my mom and me. And then He brought my new stepdad. That's nice for you. So that's it? Yup. I guess. Wesley, please. What? Are you just gonna go around being mean the rest of your life, blame God and throw rocks, because, poor you, you're the only one that's had something bad happen? I did what everyone said to do, okay? Have faith, pray hard, do all the right things. What more do you want from me? I don't want anything from you. Why do you keep following me around, huh? I'm sorry for thinking you need a friend. - I don't. - I think you do. Why can't you just leave me alone? I won't. I want to, but I won't.

It's all the clichés, all the thorns in the side, the detours, the derailments, the ditches. I don't talk about this often because somewhere along the line, I bought the lie that pastors shouldn't burden their people with their own mess. When I lost my wife and child in a complicated delivery four and a half years ago, I made a decision to never be that vulnerable again. I haven't just paid the price for that. You have, too. (sniffs) You see, for some time now, you've been led by a pastor who couldn't bear to truly walk with you in your needs, in your pain because of his own brokenness and... anger... toward God. An anger that made it impossible to share with you a God who knows you, a God who loves you. And so I relied on formulas and prescripted orders of service. I checked the boxes, I made sure that we went through the motions, and I hoped that somehow, on your own time, you were getting whatever you needed from God. (sighs) And then this boy named Wesley Eldredge came into my office, he sat down, and he called me a hypocrite. He also told me that I didn't believe... I didn't believe that God cared anything about you or your prayer requests. And he was right. And I was humiliated, and I was scared and mad... ...that someone had dared to expose the truth about who I really am. We need to tell you all something, Wesley and I. Really, it's only me who should be confessing, but in his mother's great wisdom, she asked that Wesley be present for this. I insisted, however, that you hear this story from me. I owe him this. I owe you this, Wesley. (birds singing) MRS. ELDREDGE: This was Mallory's favorite place. She loved it here. I was so proud of you today. I know it wasn't easy sitting through that. And even though I don't agree with how you did it, nothing changes the fact that you did help a lot of people. Oh. Feels like I haven't been outside in six months. Haven't seen the sun or even felt a breeze. I'm gonna go back to work soon. A few days, actually. I don't want you to think that I'm acting like everything's back to normal. I can't ever imagine feeling normal again. But I'm going crazy at home. Every time I pass her room... I need the distraction. And the bills. Are you trying to ask my permission or something? I didn't want you to think I was trying to move on too quickly, you know? Do whatever you want. I will spend the rest of my life with the anguish of losing a child. I don't want to lose two. (voice breaking): You haven't lost two. Wesley, I really need to ask you to please forgive me. I know I will never be the same mom that I was before. I'm beat up and broken and really, really sad. But I love you. And I love how hard you fought for Mallory. I mean, who has the nerve to chase God the way you did? My son does. And you know what? In those last few days, I know that God came into Mallory's room. I felt it. I can't explain it. It was just such a holy place. I know He was there. Then why isn't He here now? I don't feel Him or see Him anywhere. Why does He have to make everything so hard? Wouldn't it be so much easier if He just showed up every now and then? I don't know. (birds singing) (video game music playing) (tapping) (video game music and tapping continue) (video game music and tapping continue) (video game music stops) (creaking) (birds chirping) You're throwing rocks at my house? I couldn't make it up the steps in this dumb thing in order to ring the doorbell. So, pebbles. Understated yet effective. (sighs): Yeah. You know, it's a bad time, so... Well, of course it is. But I'm an old man who can't afford the consideration of time. So come here. I got some things to say. Fine. You got one minute. All right, so here it is. Now, you got to pay attention. Now, you've been running around, trying to get God to notice you with these noble acts of... k-kindness and courtesy. And we all hear the story and we think, "Oh, poor kid." But God never loses sight of us, not for one moment. We're the ones who lose sight of Him, because we fight to stay out of the places that He most... hangs out. You want to find God? Walk through the Valley of Death with your eyes wide open. You've joined a prestigious club I like to call the Grateful Limpers. This is the greatest pain of your life. But I speak from experience-- God is near. You will never forget losing your sister. And you'll always walk with a limp because of it. If you let it, that limp will... let you know God's grace all around you. You're gonna see Him the way that people with perfect, happy lives never do. Grace. Keep your eyes open. I got it. Stubborn. I heard that. Yeah, good. It's meant for you, too. Oh. One more thing. The steeple-- finish it. - I already quit. - Finish it. I paid you in advance, remember? You owe me. Now, I'll have some guys there two Saturdays from now to help. But you're in charge. Yes, sir. (door opens) (door closes) (indistinct chatter) Hey, Wesley. How's it going? Doing okay, I guess. Hey, I'm sorry about your sister. Thanks. Guess that's why you weren't playing this season, huh? So, Eldredge, we hear you're, like, a secret prayer agent. - Not me. - No, no, - that's what they're saying. - All right, - that's enough, Tony. - No, Derek, this is good stuff. So, how does it work? Someone writes it down and slips it in your magic box and then you sneak out at night? I mean, this is fantastic. Do you wear a costume? A cape? A mask? I said that's enough, Tony. I got it. See what you can do with this, okay? I'm gonna ask Olivia to the dance. I'm gonna write it down right here and pray she says yes. Get it? Praying? Fight! (indistinct chatter) That's enough. - What are you doing? - He didn't start it. You didn't deserve this. OLIVIA: Are you okay? - I'm fine. - You need ice. I'm fine. (brakes squeak) (bicycle thuds) Hold on, young man. School called and said you were coming back early. What happened? Nothing. Wesley, come on. Get down here, please. (sighs) What happened to your face? Like I said, nothing. Come on. Let me take a look in the kitchen. - Does it hurt? - (grunts) I don't want to talk about it right now. I'm fine. Are you sure? Maybe I should take you to get it checked out. Yes, I'm sure. Why can't people stop asking me this? The nurse already checked it out, okay? Can I go up to my room already? Uh, actually, there's something I want to show you. I went to the hospital today. - Why? -They found some of Mallory's things in a drawer. It's drawings and notes and stuff. But I haven't been able to go up there, wasn't ready, until today. I wanted you to see this. WESLEY: No. Mm-mm. MRS. ELDREDGE: "Dear God..." No. I said I don't want to hear it, okay? Wesley, please. "My brother told me I'm the bravest girl he knows, but that's only because You let me have him..." MALLORY (voice-over): ...as a big brother. Even when he's super annoying, I've always known that nothing can go wrong with him looking out for me. I need to ask You to please take care of him, because I don't think he believes in You anymore. He's very stubborn, and You might have to work extra hard to make sure he knows that You are real and that You love him very much. - Also, God... - MRS. ELDREDGE: "Also, God, "please help my mom not to cry so much. "So I guess, in closing, "I'm asking You to look over my family. Mallory." (paper folding) It looks like you got one more prayer request. CHILDREN (voice-over): Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! (cheering and applause) MAN: Go! Come on, come on! Hold up, hold up, hold up! Hey!

Okay. (cheering) WESLEY: Evan. That was a tough hop. You know, it's almost impossible to field a hit like that. I mean, coming right at you-- could've bounced any other way. I looked away from it. Should've stayed with it. I know better. Hey, you're playing a game of baseball, right? - What? - Well, you're out here playing a game of ball with a real team and real uniforms and you're in the middle of a real game. - Right? - Yeah. That's pretty awesome. You just can't forget that you love that, okay? Yeah. COACH: Evan, you're up. (cheering and applause) - Aw. - Oh. (chuckles) MAN: You got it, Evan. You got it. - (bat clangs) - (whooping) MAN 2: Come on, come on, come on! MAN 3: Come on, come on, come on! (cheering) BOY: Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

Thought I'd come once all the work was done. Ah. Smart. Think we did a pretty good job, right? You know they're probably gonna tear it down to make room for the new Children's Center. What? No, no, no. But your grandfather, he told me to work on this so that we could start using it again. It's all a big, made-up project to give you something to do. So why wouldn't you tell me that? Mm, no point, really. He'd just come up with another plan. You know my gramps-- stubborn as can be. Yeah. (clicks tongue) Um... Uh... What? I don't know how to say this. What already? Okay, you're gonna think I'm crazy. No, I won't. (sighs) I saw God today. And I came over here to think about it a little bit more, so that I could always remember what it felt like. Wow. That's not what I expected you to say. (chuckling) It was an epiphany. A realization, an understanding. I know what an epiphany means. All those people down there... (chuckles) ...they're really messed up. - OLIVIA: Uh... - Okay, what I mean is, they're all down there working and sweating and telling stories, stories about every single terrible thing that's happened in their lives. It's pretty depressing at first. But then it occurred to me that these stories are telling how God's helped them. They're telling His story. Ms. Clemons says that God is never late. Brad? Brad, well, he knows a God that can get him a new job. And Penny and her husband, they know a God that can fix a relationship. See that guy down there? He's trying to figure out why God never failed on him. And then there's your crazy old grandpa, but... he cries every single time that he thinks about... how God knows what it's like to lose a son. You put all of that together, and it suddenly seems like that tiny God that you think you can control becomes bigger and bigger and bigger and more amazing. You got all of that while painting an old church? (chuckles) I kept wanting God to see me, but I finally saw Him today. Is that even possible? Yeah. All those people down there, none of 'em realize that God is with them. He's here. And I think they should know that. Maybe... maybe you should tell them. Like, now? - Sure. Why not? - (chuckles) Who's gonna believe a 13-year-old? I will. Come on. Want to get something to eat? Yeah. Let's go. ♪ ♪ I see You. I see You. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (music ends)
