Someone order a party? Ask the sweet trim which way she goes? I can go any direction but for today... You headed to the hole or just burning gas? You know the drill. Gas, grass or... Oh I got two of the three and I don't want to ride for free. The real question is... can you handle it? The captain grants you permission to climb aboard and you better hang on... Tight? Yeah, I don't dissapoint. Ladies and germs we have reached our destination and it's time for your pilot to jump in a lake. Feels like I'm wet already. If you catch my drift. Why did we pick up the white gash? Yeah, you know what they say... Scratch a pussycat and you end up with a full time job. I think she's cute and that kitty ain't looking for a home. Nah, she is wild. Seduce and destroy that one. We all got a shot. C'mon buzzkill, you stole my freedom so let's make a dent in the tent. I'm going to put something in your mouth. I prefer meat in the seat. Mouth first lady, I'm munching like a mother. Good idea, we're going to need our strength to take on puss in boots. Come on in, like you, the water is fine. When it comes to getting moist, I like to make a grand entrance. Then by all means, please introduce me to sights unseen. Here comes the grand finale. Jump in here girl. Turn this pool into a hottie tub. Honey, do you really feel trapped? In a cage of groovy. You got rubbers, right? Rubbers? Yeah, never mind. What the hell was I doing again? This is what I'm going to do to your wiener while that feline chokes on my hairball. I bet you would relish a squirt of hot mustard. Help! Help! Where's Archie! Thank you. Thank God. How many times do I have to tell you believers. There ain't no God, just IMPALERS! Someone is fixin' to get nailed liked Jesus, darling. Praise pussy. Boys, we're born again. She's been working on this routine for weeks. You're going to love it. Alright, glad ya'll could make it down here this morning. Jesus, don't you people have homes? Well, it's only eight more hours until happy hour... so let's start drinking up those disability checks. In the meantime, I've got a hot act for you so... let's have a nice warm welcome for Miss Gia Nova. What the hell are them torches for? Well, ask a stupid question... Boo! I wouldn't finger bang your low tide snatch... if it was the last critter maker on this rotten earth. How in the hell did I end up with all this hippy cooter? Close that crab buffet. You should just torch that cock holster! Get that sack of fish sticks off my stage! Next! Gentleman, up next, she ain't your wife and she ain't your sister. That should be good enough for half of you. Let's have a big Sunday school welcome for Miss Diana Prince. What the hell do you want? Hello father. Is this a hip new fashion you're sporting? Quite flattering, the ugly just oozes to the surface. When did you get out of prison and what do you want witch? If you want your turdy little bar back, well take it. I'm an inmate in this hell of holes, you cop killing cooze. Well, I was thinking of sticking your pimpled ass in the titty-wank... or removing those last teeth for the glory hole. Nah, I like to make money. You couldn't felch a fart out of a dead cat's asshole. Retribution for my favorite eye should suffice. Now Val, It was your dimwit brother that took your sight not me. And where was the groping protection of daddy, huh? Protection? They're twisted-up. Look at me woman! They took my legs, gutted my throat and left me with a piece of metal sticking out my noggin'. I was left for dead so do your worst, you evil prick coffin. I don't care about nothing but seeing those smelly twats hang. Well sniff my peach, I guess we do have something in common. Riding the coattails of my blood feud, eh. Well get in line. After they killed a pig over in Mystic, the entire state is huntin' them rim-lickers. They've been layin' low but I hear-tell of a knuckle heads rumblin' down from Wolf pen Ridge... and you know, I'm all about a revenge plot. You've got no idea, old man. No idea what this chick is about to hatch. It just so happens I've enlisted the services of Dixie's most notorious killers... present company excluded, to give them toddlers the dirt nap they so desperately need. Their ornry reputation precedes them. Willie the stump, best tracker in all of Appalachia. Not so good in the Okefenokee with gators. Amber Joe. A psychotic with chopsocky skills in a tranny sexual body. One heap of mean confusion. And none other than Reverend Chainsaw from the Church of the Screaming Epileptic Jesus. Timber! The lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, ain't that right preacher? $5000 U.S.A. dollars for dead. Not alive, not laid-up, not tucked pretty in bed... but all ugly in a pine box. I want their heads and bonus dollars for the most painful, nut bleeding, shlong scabbin', agonizing kill. Now git. Why don't you call the cops? - No pigs! - No pigs! You got to be kidding. Which sewing circle did you find these kooks holding court? Call the pigs? Oh, you're really out there princess. Far out. You got some kind of imagination, a real dreamer you are... thinking those twinkle toe carnies could handle any job. I wouldn't hire those clowns to dig a post hole. If your looking to add to this team of cracked pots... I've heard tale of a fiddle playing kitten over in Pheonix City. My hired guns will get em'. They ain't tough. Just druggie maggots with gypsy luck. Oh that's rich. Well, at least you won't be writing any paychecks on Friday. Well, what the hell do you propose there, winky. You attack them with everything. Everything! From the sky and by sea. You got a kitchen sink, bring that too. I suppose. C'mon ringleader. Let's see what other freaks are still under this tent. Ladies and gentleman! Doctors and nurses! Gather around. We're going on an IMPALER hunt. An abortion of sorts. Years late I might add. We have cash prizes and... I'm your esteemed emcee for the opening day of dildo season. You prissy tard wads still need a clubhouse to sell dope... The IMPALERS have murdered many of our brothers. And you cuntmares need a place to dance, don't you? Well, don't stand around crying about it. Ladies, grab one of these apes and hang on. But first... You work for me. C'mon Repunzel. Open up. You know the rules. I contact you. You are never to enter the perimeter. You bring up bad memories for the doctor that are best avoided. It's mutual but this is a special delivery, dig. But hey, my bad, we can just scoot and wait for the change of seasons. You captured it? The mutation? The Australopithecine? It ain;t Goldilocks. Now how about you step to being cordial, hand out some porridge and let's end this business venture? Right this way gentleman. Well, Marco. You finally did it. Klaus! What is the meaning of this... I told you I never want to see... That's no way to treat esteemed colleagues. After all we've done for him. Is that my specimen? Not even a hello. How's the misses old chap. Oh yeah, sorry about that one. I guess she was too much trouble to bring back. Excellent. Fantastic. Place the mutation in holding cell B. See, he does cares. We need our fix, man! I need beer too, man. You're always holding out on the good poison. Yes, yes. Klaus prepare some more of the synthetic serum for our noble knights. My pleasure. I need it now! My head is splitting, man. Make it stop! Double dose Spyder. He's hanging from his web by a thread. That never gets old with you does it? I really need it. Alright Pops. You brought us back, we caught your monkey, make us real again. Now that I have the host, we can find a more permanent solution to your new life. No longer will you require daily injections. We will vaccinate you from the very same organism that brought you back. It should only be a matter of weeks. Days! Make it days. I don't ever want to see you or this chop shop again, man. I assure you, the debt will be repaid as promised. Make it stop! You better, you goddamn kraut. I have a score to settle and you don't want to be on my list, again. You knobs, pick up Spyder. Almost forgot my lucky rape knife. I'll be back. So what does the club plan to do with their new found freedom? Ride, man. Well, gentleman. Fantastic expedition. Now you must excuse me, I have much work to do. Days, old man. I want to git. Mighty lmpalers I will bring the vaccination to your lodging once it is synthesized. I'll kill you too, Frenchie. I'm Austrian but yes, duly noted. Ahh, de Ossorio. Only the best. We're almost there. Yes, Klaus. I'm very close to controlling the lytic cycle and within this specimen lies... the knowledge I've sought for so long. Now, what shall we do about our little Impaler problem? Since they have developed an addiction to the serum, won't the withdraws kill them? Won't the withdraws kill them? No, they can not, but I'm not sure they will necessarily die. We're keeping the viral replication at bay but once it breaks free from the host cells... I hypothesize we risk the host becoming even more violent as the pathogen consumes them. Very dangerous and our defenses... We don't have much at our disposal to protect us... from the inevitable coup. The police? Oh heavens no. Absurd. You have past indiscretions from your weaknesses for flesh. I'm better. It was just a passing phase. Besides, how would we explain reanimated motorcyclist and the remains... of every missing person in the tri-state area? My God, we don't want to risk leading them here. Especially at such a historic moment in time. Ridiculous when you imagine such a thing. Indeed. I'm not the only one who has experienced loss at their hands. I have a quest for you, but first I must attend to her. Still clinging to sentimentality? I owe her and she will be grateful to hear the news. Grateful? She's a monster. Klaus! I will not tolerate that language. Please, let me perform this last gesture and then I will devote every last breath t0 science. No need for concern, she also contributes useful data. It's alright little one. No more brutes and beasts. You've won the lottery to benefit science. What is this? This place. Where hard labor leads to wonderful discoveries. And you're here to help. Why are you doing this? Don't be afraid. All the emptiness in your life, you've unsuccessfully tried to fill with boys, booze and rock and roll hasn't worked, now has it? The majority of humans go through their entire existence without contributing. Oh they criticize. It's easier to condemn others when you don't make an effort. The audacity of those who don't even comprehend the foundations from which your work is built. Self appointed experts, afraid of hard work, unwilling to grasp the deeper concepts... ,always searching for passionless repetition. Sicko! Well all of that is about to change my dear. Your life will now serve a purpose. Screw you pervert! You should be honored. Could you possibly blossom into? Huh? Birth, procreation, death. Now you have the opportunity to become a building block of history. The princess of reanimation or the queen of immortality. You're just another creep looking for some ass! Leave me alone! Wild okra. Some say it was carried here on slave ships from Africa in the 18th century. These seeds found freedom long before the poor souls who brought them. C'mon guys. We're did that head go? I understand that. Yes. I know. This biker gang... motorcycle club is responsible for my brother's death and I would like to assist in their capture. Can I get some head? We are not disturbing any evidence. Just waiting on your arrival. Fine. Sounds good. We will let you handle it and mosey back to the office. Hopefully the wildlife won't tamper with your important evidence. Que tengan un buen viaje desde Atlanta y héganos saber si podemos ser de ayuda. Sheriff... I... I found the head. Have two of the boys wait here for Atlanta and then they can knock off. What are you gonna do Sheriff? Go for a drive. Okay. He said I could knock off but I'd rather wait with you and bask in some overtime. So I said, “Why don't you just go for a drive Sheriff”. He thought that was a good idea. Drive where? You know, just go for a drive. Cool off. Think about shit. Just once I would like to find some drugs or cash at a crime scene. - Yeah, tell me about it. - We are stuck in one dead end job. - I'll tell you that. - Fifty bucks, anything. Yep. Hell, a hot cup of coffee. A cold cup of coffee and a nudie mag. Anything- But I have to tell you something... no offense. I hate being a cop. Me too. - It totally sucks... - Hey, what in the world? She from Atlanta? Outer space. Looks like some kind of Cosmo-hot from a pirate planet. What's this space fox doing? Looks like she's doing something with a radio. We found this! Madam, if I may have a word. I'm here to share some valuable information. You're not one for entertaining conversation with law enforcement, are you my dear? The only good pig is roasted. Well, I do believe we share a little problem. A situation called The lmpalers. You and the rest of the world, worm. Although I don't quite comprehend your interrogation techniques... am I correct in the assumption that you search for their whereabouts? I just wasted that bacon to bring even more dogs to the hunt. Tell me something... When I squish you, will that increase my guest list? You misunderstand my intentions, young lady. I'm merely here, unarmed I might add, to solicit your services. All I can hear is buzzing... You have three seconds, bug. My associate and I are being terrorized by this group of hooligans... they murdered his wife, raped his daughter and... One second. One hundred thousand dollars for their demise and I know their whereabouts. Bingo. When a lady asks, you should really get to the point. I almost gave your bit the hook. Ok Napoleon, let's make a deal. I can't do this anymore. We're scavenging for brews. This is bullshit, man. I'm not talking about that. Well, I am! We never ride anywhere, enjoy the spoils of war and love the women. I need hooch. You heard the fat man. We just need to hang until the doc gives us new dope. Yeah, only a few more days and we set sail. Freedom. I need a real woman. Something big and bouncy. These dyke campers and zit-faced teens ain't gettin' me off, you dig. And I don't know if I can share a shack with Jimbo anymore. Yeah man, you stink like a barrel of smashed assholes. Jump in a lake or something, damn. I'm just rotting like the rest of you bums. I don't want to be a zombie. Not to steal your bow here, but I eat beaver, not brains. You know what I mean. A plantation puppet. Might as well be cutting cane. We've done some horrible things and we're paying the price. Yeah, demons from hell. This is hell! And I'm about sick of needing that black shit just to get on walking sticks. I noticed you've been trying to layoff the stuff. You barely take it too, Jimbo. Hell, what haven't you been addicted to Spyder? This should be a breeze to kick. It ain't like that. We got no say in this fix. Go find a water walker to worship. I'm just looking to free myself. Even if I have to make it permanent. Here he goes with the cryptic melancholy shit. We all know what happens. In case you forgot... Horseshit! That gorilla snatchcrotch son of a bitch we caught ain't the same thing that gutted me. - Me neither. - Not the dude. This one was bigger. Meaner. Marco knows this, but that cock waffle doesn't care about finding any more of them. Why is that? I don't trust that hack or his snitch. And there ain't no way on the Tooth Fairy's goddamn green earth those two queers live by any code other than Nazi. They're hatching something with no payoff for the lmpalers! I'm figuring there ain't no refills and we're just... stroking-off approaching one big expiration date. Wooo! They're toast. That's how you do it. Some old style Egan's Rats, Kill Squad shit right there, boys. Now was that so hard? You ladies ready for one hell of a party? Yes! Let's collect some scalps. Te llevaste toda la diversién... Jimbo, run up to those trees and take care of these varmints. My pleasure. Son of a bitch! C'mon! Damn, son. You always get the shit end of the stick. Could have made an honest living as a human magnet. A worthless cum dumpster. Now he's a straight shooter. Ain't nothing straight about old suicide. Stop it, goddamn it! Now children. Collins, climb those trees and take care of those vermits. I've had enough of their chatter. You're not human! Come on man... you don't have to do this. C'mon please. Fuck! Please, don't do it! Q-m o '1' m Qa SQ! Nobody wants to play with me today. Let me guess, Larry is still alive? Not anymore, asshole. Then why all the animosity little girl? What happened to you? Oh, I've been places. Charms still intact. So, is this all about your go-go buddies from back in the day? Try last week, asshole. Oh, my bad. Seems longer than that. How time flies. What do you say we flip a coin. Heads you loose, tails I rape you. A whole world of heat is about to be unleashed on you, you undead fudge packer! You don't say. Three bounty hunters gunning for you, fuzz and the Feds. The stars are aligned to mop you up. You're human garbage... about to loose it's smell. No future. Wow. You know as amusing as I find your yappety yap, yap, I got no time, lady. Val is back. What did you say? Val is back and she's gonna get you real good, man. Can your stench dig on that? I ain't afraid of that looney poon. You're all gonna die. Every last stinking one of you! Too late, sister. Time to teach you some manners, Impaler style. What do you say boys? Screw you! Let me check the oil. That's nice, real nice. Sweet little motor. Low on miles. I can imagine all the engines you've revved. But you never played for that team, did you honey. Not a trace of low tide between them legs. A shame really. That is one hundred percent birthing box for sure. How many beers were bought in a failed attempt to part your sea? I'm gonna give you the stickin' of your life, honey. I might even let you live long enough to coathanger my youngin'. Go ahead, ain't gonna matter when Val comes around. Yappity zappity snatch trap zippidty doo, blah, blah, blah. Enough of her. She wouldn't of appreciated my sweet moves anyhow. Best to ditch her before she started bad mouthing Zeppelin. It was headed in that direction. Val, huh? So the bitch is back! Goddamn it! What is it with their crazy kin? I wonder how long we got? You know, she's gonna try to blow us up. That's what she does. Oh you can bet your burning bike she got her one peeper on us right now. She keeps it interesting, that's for sure. Found some beer. Well, hail Satan's Own. Thank you Jimbo. Glad someone is working. Perfect. Howdy, Jett. I think you owe me a beer, Wille. Been a spell. Hold up, guys- You still telling folks the tale of, “Oh the gator ate my hand... but I got a lovely pair of boots from it”. I got a new hand Jett. Do I need to rip it off your arm and shove it up your ass so it can shake hands with the original? My blade meeting your innards will suffice. What brings you to this neck of the woods Willie? Hunting you. Let me guess, Larry's cold hard cash or is it Val's haunted spider... pussy that got all these big ideas floating around that pickle jar you call a head? Everyone is hunting you. Must be, since they dredged the bottom of the barrel just to ruin my tasty beverage. Say, what happened to your hand for real, Willie? I never told you boys that story? Enlighten us. Truth is... well truth is Myron... MVFOn? Yep, double dip Myron Kowalski from Cincinnati. Made a good career of skimming drugs and double crossing, didn't you Myron. Oh, and snitchin' to the heat every chance he got. And you were the... I was the one to take Myron's knuckles. Skimming profits? Nope, caught him whacking off to youngins on a playground. Damn! He deserved it then. You're such the moral one, Jett. I live by a code. I'm amending it daily. Growing you could say, but lofty ideas ain't exactly why I cut his hand off. No, I warned Myron I would cut off his taliwhacker if I ever caughthim gripping for gravy kids again... and you know what this fool went and did? Shut up Jett. Damn if I didn't catch him beating off to me bangin' my old lady. Staring right at the crack of my ass too! Ain't that a kick in the shit maker. So then what did I do Myron? So then what happened? Yeah, don't leave us in suspense. Let me guess, you cut his hand off? Duh. Cut his hand off with a rusty hacksaw the kids found buried in the yard. Not much of a blade either. Not all nice and sharp like this GinsuShintaro Katsu looking thing. Then what did I do Myron? Please. I got information. Not only is Val and Satan's Own after you. There's Amber Joe, Reverend Chainsaw, a shit ton of cops. A Frenchman too. Paying big bucks. I said, then what did I do Myron? I'm afraid to ask. Then I made him beat off with his severed hand. While I resumed bangin' my old lady, obviously. Did you hear what he said? You had a wife? You had kids? Bravo! Nicely done, sir. I'm gonna do some recon over at the mad monster party. You boys... You boys do whatever it is you do. Kind of embarassed to ride one of those Satanic scooters but it ain't easy being Jett. Shhh. What bloody spirit you have. I'm getting out of here and if I have to go through you, so be it. It appears my little pigeon lacks direction. I really... Can't fathom... Why... You would want to go down there. Hush! Silence you filthy whores! Now that is rather inconvenient. Now, now my dear. I have wonderful news know, I know. This isn't an ideal situation for anyone but... I have enough of the natural pathogen to perform a transplant. We will give you a new body and all injustice will be undone. She's a cow. I wasn't fat. Now dear. Why did you bring me back? You never gave a damn about me! This is for your own sick amusement isn't it! I know I haven't been your ideal male guardian. You didn't even scale to the heights of neglect. Who makes their child a slave, brings them back from death, the only escape I've ever known... and then turns them into a sideshow freak? Yeah, you're the parent of the year. My dear, we've all suffered. I've gone through extreme measures, sparing no cost, to make things pleasant for you. I want you to be happy. Happy? You don't know the meaning of the word, father. I'll tell you what will bring me joy. Kill me! Put me out of my misery. Then kill yourself. End this nightmare. You ungrateful little girl! You comprehend nothing. I know a whole lot more than you give me credit for, doctor. Is that another victim for the good of science lying upon that gurney? Well, is it? I'm sorry. Your brain is in relatively good shape. I can make you well. This I promise. Once you start walking and living again, this subordinate attitude of yours will change. Go to hell and send me back too. Do it! Do it! Goddammit Edna! You have no choice! You hear me little girl. You've never had a choice. Either you work with me or spend the rest of eternity submerged alive in a jar! You want this body or not? I have others. Pick one or I'll transplant you on whatever I deem convenient. Someone thin. Thank you. I'll make this end. Est assured, I'll stop you. You've got to be kidding me. Hello darlin'. Miss me? He brought you back too? Fabulous. The plot just sickened. After all the destruction you caused... why on earth would Dr. Frankenstein bring you back? Monster wrangler. Monsters capturing monsters. Brilliant. Now don't be like that, baby. Last I saw you, there was a mighty fine little girl attached. Well, that beast sent me straight to hell. Surprised I didn't see you there. Would of been nice to pick up where we left off but you and I both know where death took us. Unfortunately. I do. I owe you an apology. You think? Yeah, I wasn't on my best behavior. Sometimes revenge has a way of clouding your thinking. You embrace it, become it and all you know is pain. You dig? Yes. I never meant you any harm. Yeah. No, honest lnjun. In some bizarre way this twisted up head... Uh, sorry. No problem. Look at me now. Hatefuelled the rage inside me. Made me question what I was focused on. That's all I feel. Well, I'm sorry. Truly. I guess it's too late to make good. In the end, nothing matters. It's just a shitty state of affairs all the way around. I don't blame you. I wasn't always rotten. Can you help me bring down this insanity? Done. In a way, your gang invading my home... Was the only interesting thing to ever happen to me. That's sad. Yeah. Klaus! Sorry to interrupt this pathetic display of surrealism but what are you doing here? Checking up on the family, doc. Klaus! You know vermin doc, can slide in undetected anytime they want. I see. Seeing how she and I have an invested interest in your experiments... I thought it best to come hang out and see first hand how these revisions were going down. Out. Bullets don't argue. Are you familiar with the Amiacalva? Pardon? You may know the common name. Bowfin. A mudfish? Yes. I've had them on a line. Interesting thing about the Amiacalva. All other species of fish, whether a two ton sunfish or the parasitic lamprey... that bores through it'sscales, they all evolved from just two orders. At over 32,000 species, fish exhibit greater diversity thanany other group of vertebrates. Then there is Amia calva, the bowfin. A taxonomic relict, the sole surviving species of the order... Amiiformes from the Jurassic period... persisting to the present. Primitive and alone. You're calling me a fish? I'm saying you do not belong. He stays! Klaus! What ya got Sheriff? From the looks of it, a massacre. Where are the bodies? Good question. You boys ever seen tracks like that? Not since this morning's carnage... I mean crime scene, Sheriff. You didn't think that was pertinent to the investigation? Hell, you said it was Atlanta business and all. Yeah, I did say that. It's strange, sometimes how we're tested through unspeakable tragedies and misfortune. I try to comprehend the senseless injustice and suffering to which we bare witness. I do know, to justify and extol human greed and egotism is not only immoral, but evil. Every man, woman and child is of equal importance and it takes real character to keep your empathy intact. If you succeed, you're a real man. Jesus say that? No, I did. You know, there are books you could be reading the other six days of the week. See you at the station? Oh no, boys. You just got promoted to waiting on Atlanta. "Pertinent to the investigation". What a tool. I know, right. Did you hear that other crap he was saying? Somebody is dipping into the evidence room. Biggest thing to hit turd town and we can't even shit. This place is awful. Why in God's name do we live here? All the nightlife and action. I mean, seriously. What kind of cabbage humpers choose to spend their time in the boonies... away from all the new ideas out in the real world? There's culture we're missing. Yeah. I love the beach. The air, the food, the girls are smarter too. Why don't I live there? Sucking out septic tanks in the goddamn Gulf of Mexico would be better than this meat tunnel. Come five o'clock, drink in hand, toes in sand, everything good. Oh yeah. Gonna be alright, tonight. I'll tell you why. Why? Family. Yep. Goddamned family. All because some corn-holing, God fearing relative decided to... marry some wide-hipped women to birth dirt farming babies... I'm supposed to be glued to the region. Screw that! You're giving me an idea. Let's buy a damn boat and do some chartering. I'll do it. Dock worker, dishwasher, hobo. Damn, if I'm alive at the beach, I ain't picky. Well, I'm in. This ain'tlivin'. No more excuses. I'll pack up after this shift. Deal. What are you doing? We need our shots. Fellas, fellas. You got me all wrong. We need it now, man. If you excuse me, I'm late to a very important event that will ask all your questions. Randall, why don't we take one of the matches of this tick? - Burn his ass! - Please, no! Please! This meeting is very important for all of you. You'll find it very interesting. - C'mon guys, follow me. - I hope so, man. You ready for this? More than ready. This will be permanent? There is enough of the new serum to keep her alive for seven years Until I can find a more concrete solution. So you don't have the answers. He never does. I'm scared... Enough serum to keep her alive. As long as she doesn't reject the new body. While your group was mostly intact, I could never locate her original torso. Like I was saying. Enough serum to keep her alive. That ain'tincluding my daily ration, now is it? I'm close. Maybe two or three years away. Isn't that just perfect. Look Karloff, not good enough. Not good enough. I have an interest here too! Oh I'm interested in your interest. If I remember correctly... Didn't I fill your body full Of lead? Wait a second. Are you dead too, doc? Did Igor bring you back, you sneaky old corpse? While your bullets were quite painful, they missed my vital organs. Well, goobahgabba. One of us. Hardly. My condition is more extreme. Of course, you're always better then everyone. Excuse me, your highness. The contagion, while temporarily reanimating dead tissue has a different effect on living tissue. What kind of effect? Imbecile! If you must know you foulmouthed philistine. I have to live with something much worse than you. A never ending pain called... Metamorphosis. Do you want to hold my little baby? Are you ok? Her name is... Do you know a way out. I know the way out. Do you want to hold my baby? Her name is... Please, I beg of you. How do I get out of here? This is the nursery. Do you like it? It's lovely. I'm going to leave now. Don't go. Do you want to hold my baby? Her name is Hope! I'm going to go. OK. It's time for baby to go to sleep. Say good night to baby. Ok, good night. See what you did Hope! We can't have friends because of you. You changed everything! You changed everything! Time to go nightnight baby! Go to your home baby! Go away Hope! No! Stop it! Get in your home little maggot. Mama loves you. Please stop! I wish you were never born! You've ruined my life, but I love you. I have no choice! All tucked in. I hate wine, you know? Taste like sucking off the Jew King. We've done some evil shit, man. Now beer, that's what this nigger needs. Lowenbrau, Fallstaff, Falls City, Hudepohl, Dixie... Do you ever think about it? Pabst Goddamned Blue Ribbon. Oh yeah. Its got to get to you, too. Well I do. So I'm gonna take science into my hands. The culinary sciences that is, mixed with the old philosophy of you are what you eat. There has to be repercussions for our actions. Under the right conditions I would be smoking a big ol' dry rubbed shoulder, nice and slow with some mesquite. There just isn't. Do you ever think about it? Dude, do you ever think about any damn thing! I think about finishing that smoked meat with a one hour braise in a pan full of apple cider... with a stick of butter on top. Think about that. What the hell are you doing? Frankenstein's monster meat. I'm gonna get the nutrients. Might become invincible. You got to be kidding. So, anyway. Remember the girl? I doubt this will taste like chicken. - The girl we murdered. Remember? - It's a loin so it should be tender. Hey ass clown! You remember the pregnant girl we murdered? You mean the one we raped, cut outher baby and goofed around with the little squirt? I can't forget it. It haunts me. Ah, destruction is a form of art. I didn't think you were that into her. Well Mr. Softy, I heard she lives in the basement of Dr. Death's flesh factory. Why don't you godown there and say howdy for old times sake? No remorse at all. Nope. How does it taste? Exotic and gamey. Give me some. Does it turn your frown upside down? That's terrible! I'm gonna bail. Where you going? Beer run. Pull the lever. Yep. Always the lever. Klaus! Klaus! Take over. Yes, Dr. Marco. How could you. Becoming absent at such a critical moment. And don't let those fools touch anything! Truly sorry, Dr. Marco. How come we didn't get all these bells and whistles when you brought us back? I feel cheated. You don't know the half of it. Did it work? Dr. Marco. It's progressing rapidly, Klaus. Unbearable. I need to lie down. Did it work? Only time will tell. Thank you. Quickly, place the australopithecine back into holding cell 9. I'll tend to the doctor. The what? The hominid. The Bigfoot. Quickly. Blatz, Burger, Wetland, Ballantine. Hell, I would even drink a warm Piels about now. That's desperate. I can't go any further. We're not gonna make it without more injections. You can do it, man. Just get that first sip. Then what? Who cares. Let's get a drink and then figure it out. I don't want to, man. Awvvw you say that now. Hey, I think about the cruel shit we did too. Let's get that beer and try to forget awhile. If you really want to share your feelings, I guess I'll listen to that shit too. But first, beer! Yeah, ok. Grain Belt! Now that's a beer, especially on tap! If anyone comes out, you fill em' full of hellos. We're under attack. Those damn motorcyclists! I don't have much time. Prepare an l.V. of serum, quickly. Klaus! Do it now! I'm experiencing paralysis. That would be the horse tranquilizers? Excuse me? Yes, I put them in your last injection. Why? Really took a spell. Much longer than I had anticipated. Klaus. What have you done to me? Doctor, none of this is headed in any logical direction. Not a path in sight that could possibly lead to a positive outcome... for anyone in this building. It's quite absurd to think otherwise. What are you saying... I saved you to steal from you. Plain and simple. I never liked you. Klaus, we've been colleagues... You know. You're so demanding, self centered, narcissistic and honestly... - not very good at what you do. - IKlaus! Let us look at the data. You're a failed anthropologist who stumbled upon a wonderful discovery. I'm intelligent enough to know my limitations. We've had our amusement. Now I'll take the pathogen to a corporation and see... if it has any real medical, industrial or military applications. That my fellow colleague, is where the moneybegins. Now, I must leave your crumbling house of Usher, for somewhere in the Caribbean... lies a yacht with de Ossorio for my belly and pretty ladies for my whims. All your hypothesis can burn with you! I picked an extra thick needle for this occasion. As I'm sure you're aware doctor, it isn't necessary to use such a long gauge. It's just that I so deeply love watching others suffer. I'll leave you with one last experiment. You can take notes on full transmutation... to the grave! Think he'll find a cure? Who knows. Sounds like we got company outside. Yeah. We always do. Sure hope VAL ain't with them. Well, if it isn't my big biker brothers. Speak of the devil. Oh boy. Yeah, glad to see you too, Collins. With my remaining eye, anyway. How many times do I have to apologize for that Sis? Doesn't get old. No, it doesn't. Pretty hard to forget. We're screwed. Glad your out of jail. Seriously. You're not in cahoots with the old man are you? No, I finished what you boys couldn't. We tried but he's one stubborn roach, just keeps coming back. Keep sucking so I can stay awake. My own family! I'll kill them swamp gnats before... they bury old Larry's boots. - Damn right I will. - Watch the teeth, honey. First I need my spic lady doctor. It ain't rocket science, just suck it. No! Anything but... You! You sons of bitches! Spyder! Come look at this shit. Ain't that a sight? See what you might have missed, Spyder? Don't you goddamn spit it out and don't you dare swallow. Put my pecker in your fish flaps and keep it safe! No! Don't you dare! Get up! Get them lousy beef curtains up! I'm gonna kill you! Goddamn pecker breathvagoobastards. I'm gonna kill every last one of you. I'm gonna pry open the mouth of that dead moose knuckle, get my cock and ram it up your turd cutter! You hear me! You hear me! You'll see. Gonna cut your balls off too. How you like them apples? Ha! Cut your tiny weenies off, shove em' up and down your whore mama's meat wallet... and then kill you real good. You'll get a second to pray and a minute to die. Kill you all! Every last one of you foreskin sniffing lmpalers. Feel bad about that? Not in the least. - I could do this all day. - Agreed. Now Val, we're family. No need to wave around a boom box. Set that off and you destroy the last of ourlineage, dig? A bad thing? Don't think it hasn't crossed my mind but sorry to disappoint you, Collins. I'm here to see Randall. N011 you! Hey, fine by me. Just the sight of you hinders my high. There was a time when just the silhouette of my curves could make any man jizz. Relax. You still got it. Really, bro? Come on, Randall. Let's catch up. Let me see what this is all about. BYE bye. I've never understood the connection between you two... She's going to blow somebody up, mark mywords! Let me out! You can't kill me. Yes! I can hear you! Kill them! Kill them all! How you doing? Alive. Well, you look good. Real good. I feel alright. You had me worried. It was quite the production... I've missed you. Shhh. You're the only family I've felt a strong connection with. Shhh. We've always had more than a connection, haven't we? Oh yeah. We've had some wild times. You were my first. You know that. Mine too, keeping it in the family. Shhh. Don't say that. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's been a long time, full of really heavy shit. Prison didn't do me much better, brother. New fish to queen bee was a fast enough ride. Had to go lez just to keep warm at night. It wasn't so bad. I know my way around a honey pot but as you can imagine, the quality wasn't the best. Fox free, huh? I'm sure you managed. All those nights. Many nights. It wasn't the hatred for our father that kept me going. Cop killing? Although I did almost shiv the muff of a horny wardress from midnight to dawn, no. And it wasn't even the childhood memory of that little shit Collins plucking my eye out with a spoon. Fire and explosions? No, silly. It was you. You're going to blow us up? Huh, baby. I just like the excitement. I need a favor. Anything- Remember that thing we use to do? Just name it. Say it! I want your seed in my brain Say it! Skull fuck me. Shut up! Everyone just shut up! Get out of my store hair farmers! The cops are on the way. Do you still have some of that beer? I said, get the hell out of my goddamn store! Have some suds Spyder. Everyone please exit the building. I've been looking for some of these. Good Lord. I can't keep it down. The pain is unbearable. I'm feeling better by the second. Everyone shut up! They ain't human. They got the devil in them for sure. What in the hell do we do with this mess, Sheriff? Put down that beer and sit next to your buddy. Sit! - Damn junkies. - That's what they are! You know, you sure look familiar. He's talking about your dead brother Sheriff. So you're responsible for all this misery? Oh, yeah. That would be us. Man, you cats look alike. Damn sure does. Uncanny. I swear it's a ghost. Kill em' Sheriff. Yeah, we'll vouch for ya. The killing is stopping. No more. I'm with you there, apparition. Never thought I would say that to a pig. So where is the rest of the pack? In the old mill. I know the place. uncool What's gotten in to you, man? They're going to find out anyway. You go up that mountain pig, you best take a body bag and scrawl your name on it. Just put an apple in your mouth and jump into the fire. Enough! Just saying. It's some weird heavy shit, man. Make your brain check out. Yeah, I kind of figured it was more complex then you two degenerates. Just sayin'. All I was doing. You just do them right here Sheriff Crews. Yeah, they're doped up nutty people! Well, you're the last minimum wager I have. Let me guess, wait on Atlanta? You got it. Now nobody is to harm these suspects. If you want to help, cuff them to the cooler and have yourself a few. I'll be back. Suspects. I'll go on record. Guilty. We're lmpalers! No violence. I killed your pig brother myself! I only have one pair. One guy looks about dead anyway. He ain'tgoing nowhere. Now who the hell are you? Brothers. I'm a weary traveler. For I've been on a mission. There are demons amongst you. No disrespect Reverend but we can see that. What you can not see is these are not men but unholy vessels of evil... containing Satan himelf For they are not human. They are not of our world. These are spawns from the black abyss. No need to convince me. Me either. Ditto. Now hold on a minute. Holy shit! Do you guys see that devil shit? Idiots. Why does he not die? Good question. For he is already dead. The living dead, possessed. We must exorcise the unholiness before it's tentacles spread... consuming God'swomen and children. Your women and children. I'm convinced. Me too. Deputy? What do we have to do? Oh I know what I'm going to do. We must remove the flesh to battle the soul. Damn, that was good. How about you? You dig my paste up in your brain, don't you? Pathetic. C'mon, now. Men. You're addicts. Val? Captives. You can try and replace it with booze, power, greed... family. What? You have to fill that slave role with something, anything. Nah. Oh it can be almost anything. Work, ridiculous hobbies, biker gangs. All excuses for the one score you'll willingly condemn yourself. What in the hell are you saying? Your animalistic urges for pussy. Well, it didn't take long for the crazy to resurface. We're crazy but only when we forget that we control you. We supply the fix. There's love, right? Love! Don't make me laugh! I love a good tampon tamer now and then but it's all starting to come back to me You're whacked. If you drop a load on a girl's mind, you should at least have the decency to hear her thoughts! I've heard enough of your shit. I don't think you have! You bitch! I get it. Just messing with me. Good one! I'm sorry. I love you, sis. Really! And they led him into the fields of swine So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. Damn. Spyder, a little help over You're next fruitcake. Gonna git you good. Cue up God's good word. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. What you say to that devil man? Superstition. You don't want to hear the truth? We shall remove another limb. No wait! There goes another one. No saldré caminando de aqui, eso es seguro. Lord, this is one awful mess. I'm gonna have to order more mops. Would you just hold on a second, you dumb hicks. That will win them over. I get your confusion. Preach on brother Jimbo. Yes, I was dead but science brought me back. Now what? The arms? How about that mouth of his. Keep it "P guys! Good job! And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city... and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. So you're not the least bit curious as to what I saw when I died. Why would they be? Do not listen to his temptations. Here me out. None of you are interested in peeping through a window into the afterlife? Not in the least bit? Silence devil. - Now hold on. - Tell me. There was a bright light. Warm and comforting light. Yeah? There were visions. Like what? Angelic. My entire family was there. All my kin. The son I tragically lost. God, he was my life. I knew it! Even my old dog was there. Your dog? I'm messing with you Goober. You wanna know what I saw? Nothing! No feeling whatsoever. Just death! So you might as well do what you please. Let go of me! There's no god. There's no devil. No pearly gates and no pigs! There's nothing crackers! You're all sheep with a mouth full of shit! And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus! And when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart... Hate thy neighbor, I guess. What a day. You we're packin' the whole time? Well, I needed to pay you back for dragging me down here just so you could drink some beer. C'mon man! Time for me to leave. You burned me good, Spyder. You need anything else? Naw. I'm peachy. Think I'll just hang around here awhile. Ok, then. Good times huh, man? Spyder! Hey man. You gonna be ok? No Jimbo. I'm not going to be ok. I'm not ok at all. Help! Help! You know the drill. Well, let me pass out the welfare checks and Kool Aid. What a sorry lot of slug snot. I should have recruited from a nursery school. You cry babies can sit around soiling yourself and sucking your thumbs on your own dime. Nap time is over. Whatever secrets are hiding in that hellhole, they must be priceless. Hard to fence priceless but it's worth a look. Hold on, partner. Whoa! That's my juice! Let me go fetch the frog. I have something to take care of myself, be careful. Yeah, you too. I've something to show you... Go. Run. Get out of here! I said get out! You're free! You sick cunt! Excuse me. I know who you are. That body. There's no time. We have to get out of here. That's her body! I'm here to help you. You're the one needing help. Take her life. You're one of them. I've seen all the far-out twisted shit in this nut house! I'll kill you monster. I'm sump,! I was just trying to help! Whatcha doing twinkle toes? Blowing the scene? So many obstacles. There always are. So how much money do you want? I need my shit. With Dr. Marco deceased, you have limited time, sir. Why not make the best of it with your new vaginal abomination. You know, that mosquito ain't stopping me? It has to sting a little. You get use to it. I see. Alright cheese souffle, we'll do it your way. I'll trade you a coffin. You can raise the dead, change a head, but you can't switch out the brain. Please! They're crazy. They're all crazy! Are you hurt? No! They'll kill you! We need to run. You can't kill them. They're all insane! Wait here. No, we both need to get the hell out of here! We have to go, now. Stop it! C'mon bitch! Grab him! I'm so happy that you joined us. Jett! iJett! She-male, you're up. Let's see if you're more lad or lass, shall we? What is it you want, Klaus? This, my dear. Look! Such entertainment on a grand scale. Who would of thought! I don't understand! What does this all mean? What is the point! They're all mad! Silence! You'll get your turn to die. Sadist! You ain't seen nothing yet. Hey ya'll watch this! The main event! Oh jeez. Father? Not anymore. Oh he's in there. Somewhere. Let's do this! It's a win-win for me, really. I don't have a cock in this fight. Jett! Isn't this romantic. Jett! IBravo! INooo! What a performance! Tie up the loose ends, won't you. I have something for you. Where did you come from? Are you hurt? Do you want to see? She's one of them. Let's go! You're gonna wanna see this. Get me out of here, please! Drive asshole! Yeah, ok. I really wanted to show you... Oops, was that stuff important? Shoot her! How quickly they forget. Who in the hell are you? That's Val. How do you know her? Man hater. And your a misogynistic pig! I don't hate women. Far from it. They can wear pants and vote. Pretty sure their smarter than me. Not threatened by gals at all, I just ain't a big pussy. You are the last Impaler standing. Was not aware of that. Makes sense. Hard to kill a good thing. Since you two have some catching up... I'll politely remove myself from the conversation. Not yet, flea. You see. I thought killing my father would help. Nope. Why does everyone feel the need to reveal their plan to me? So I thought killing Collins would help. Nope. But, it only worked a little. You're really going to draw this explanation out, aren't you. Hush! Don't upset her. She was born upset. She is clearly unstable. Maybe you should turn that gun on yourself, bitch! Maybe killing the last Impaler will do the trick. Sounds perfectly logical. Don't forget, you hate all men. Hate. Yeah hate. It turns out... I don't just hate just men. I hate everyone who isn't me! I hate everything. Watching you and Dr. Frankenstein play god, well it was weird. I appreciate the loan extension. Arrivedercci, ratatouille. Austrian. I'm Austrian you imbecile! Auf Wiedersehen. Dear god no! Where do we go from here? I don't feel good. Just keep walking. Something is wrong. It takes awhile to get use to bullets but they work themselves out, darling. It's something worse. We're going to have to lay low somewhere. We need to get out of here fast. I'm sorry. No worries. We need to move! What's happening? Get it off! Get it off! There is nothing on you! What do you need, woman? Jett. Jett. Yeah- What are we going to do? Haven't quite wrapped my... I need a new body. I'm sorry. - Jett. - Yeah. I want to please you. You got to be joking. Please. Ain't going to happen. You're all I have. You have bigger problems, little girl. Please. One last time. Thank you. We need to get back in the lab. Oh it's gone. We can repair it. The joint is swarming with pigs and that animal is in there too. We'll go back when they leave. Oh they'll be a awhile. We can wait. My father wrote everything down. We can fix the equipment and follow his lab books. Pretty sure they'll haul that stuff away. I just need a new body. Uh huh. Find me a body, Jett. Something you like and we'll figure it out together. I wouldn't know where to start. I love you, help me, work with me. I'm trying to think of solutions! There are more of those creatures out here. We can make enough serum. We can! I'm just a biker, baby. We have enough to last us three and a half years, each. That's more than enough time. We'll be together. Think about it. Even if this doesn't work. We'll have three and a half years. Seven. What? Seven is my lucky number.
