City officials reiterate that there is no hard evidence... to relate the 3 disappearances. Meanwhile the Singer family continues... to hope their daughter will return unharmed. Awful, awful, awful story, Lance. Coming up: Can a trip to the Doctor be hazardous to your health? And Josh Kincaid with the weather. Where is she? Chip is freaking out. - She's not doing it , Ben. She threw up. - What? Mom, we have to. Chip is gonna kill us. Benjamin Keller, look at your mother. Just do it without her, Ben. I'm not doing it if she's not. I don't want to do it either... ... but we told Chip we would. - Fuck Chip! - I'm with her. But we said... Hey, do you always do what other people tell you to do? That's no way for a millionaire to behave. Yeah! Benjamin! Don't you think I'm trying? Shh!!! Guys? - They're ready for you. - Bye, Chip! You guys are crazy... We should have gone out to dinner tonight, and taken Lucy with us. She's got better things to do, I'm sure. It's just so funny seeing her again. Do you remember how close you two were when you were kids? You were inseparable. So cute. It was a 100 years ago. She did not have it easy, you know. I would feel so bad... You growing up without a father, and I would look at her's. Well... And when her mother died, and then to see you two together... - I just... - What are you saying? Look, I don't want you to be afraid, OK? Now that you have, you know... What? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know... I just... a mommy gets tired. I feel like I'm going to the loony bin. My son, the millionaire. No, I'm not. It's all a dream. Yeap... Big changes are coming... Are you ready? No. Yes, you are. "Hello?" You about ready? "Ready and waiting. Where are you?" - Greenleaf. -"Did you make reservations?" Yes, I did, I'll be there in a minute. "You told them it's your birthday, right? "Because they have that special cake that they only give to you... - "...if you tell them." - I told them, I told them. - "What time?" - I told them about 6. - "Ben, that's too early!" - But that's all they had. - "Did you tell them who you are? - No. "Ben, we've been together for 2 months now.? Haven't I taught you anything?" Oh... don't start now, OK. I'm already here. - Handsome man. - Beautiful woman. - Upper body, today? - No, I skipped. - I'll do it tomorrow. - I put you on a schedule for a reason. You can't skip, you'll screw it all up. Perfection! Let's go shopping! Let's go, Ben! - Which one do you like? - Is it me, or are they all just ugly? Ben... Ah, man, this is what Pauline wants. She told me. Well, last year, I got her a Whitman sampler and she loved it. That was last year. It had a little map to find all the chocolates. I'm sure it did. - Hey, listen to me a minute... - Would you like to look at one? Yes, the lady with the harp. Alright then. How about the mother and child? Forgive me, but are you Benjamin Keller? - Ah... - Yes he is. Ohhh... my goodness! - How exciting. - Can you hold this for a second? How about the mother and child? You went to high school with my son, Charlie Baton. I'm Sue Baton. Nice to met you. But I need your help. Ben, which one do you like. Any one of these is fine. Let's just make a decision and go. Do you remember Charlie? Because, he remembers you quite well. - Who? - How about a unicorn? This one's nice too, depending on the occasion. Oh, my God! Oh my God! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Ah... Oh my God! We'll go... and we'll just pay for it, and just go. - Ben, relax. - Here, do you take Mastercard? That's fine, don't worry. You can certainly... It was an accident. We have another one like it right here. Would you... would you...? No, no, just ah... Alright, alright, I'll just bring this back out. No problem. - I told you! - What? We should go. Let's just go. Hey, Ben, she has your card. Just hang on. - What's wrong with you? - Let's just get out of here. Alright, we should go! Hey Ben, you may not know who you are, OK, but I do. So you dropped a... a lady with the harp. Who cares? Hey! You are Benjamin Keller, and you can do whatever you want. Do it. Aaaahhh!!! What are doing? You see? "BEAUTIFUL WORLD" by Christoffer Hoyer begins... "What a beautiful world..." "Everywhere that I look on down the road... "You stir, my soul." "Such a beautiful day...

Let's just get the hell out of here and go back to the hotel. OK, I'll just go grab the waiter. Can you just go get the bill? - Yes. Of course. - Hurry. - They didn't? - No? Fantastic. - Ah... Lucy...? - Let's go. - Do you have any cash? - No. Okay... um... - Our credit card was declined. - That's alright, we'll use our other card. No, that's been dead for days. No it's not, it comes right out of your account. I know... - It's empty. - No, Ben... That's impossible. Because it's "36 million". I mean, hello! You know I don't get it all at one time, right? I mean, it comes... it's not important. - The point is that... - We don't have any money? That's why I was asking you if we had any cash. At all? Well... ah...

How are we gonna get out of here? 14 dollars and 36 cents. Well, that will be enough to get us to the airport. Okay, great. I don't have to eat. Ohh, look! A black banana! - Lucy... - I cannot believe it. Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was? I'll get you another bracelet. No. From now on, I'm handling the money. When it feels good to actually do something for yourself. Why do I have to do everything around here? Could you please not yell at me? You have been tipping people a 100 bucks a pop. What happens tomorrow when "Mr. Big Man" can't give anybody, anything? Please don't yell at me. You threw away almost a million dollars! Oh, so you married me for the money? Is that it? Dammit. I'm sorry. You are? Is there a problem, Mr. Keller? No, I'm not awake... Allison. Allison. Oh... thank you. Bet you want a tip now. Mr. Keller?... Ugh! Ben! Ben! Ben, I'm sorry... "Help!" "Help me!"

We should pack. Just tell me you don't hate me. Please. It will never happen again. I just can't handle the idea of you being mad at me, alright?... You're right, you should handle the money. It's.. it's.. it's our first fight. It's our first, and last. OK? You really... hurt me back there, Ben. Oh, no, no, please, please, don't say that. You did, Ben. Maybe, we rushed into all this. No... I'll do anything. Anything. Just please... ...Just give me a chance. Tell me what to do. I just need to know that you'll never... ...hurt me... like that... again. Never. Say it. I will never hurt you. Never. No matter what. I would rather die. How long have we know each other? Hmm? OK, Ben. Really? Thank you. Thank you... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. That's OK. Heyyy!!! Wow! Welcome home. My goodness. So good to see you! How was it? Was it really great? Oh.. I'm so happy to see you. Lucy? You look exhausted... - Where's your cane? - Carl tossed it. I don't need it any more. - What? That is fantastic! - Who's Carl? Carl's my trainer. You know I'm really worried about her. - Oh, she is just tired. Honey, you OK? I'm fine... I'm fine... Where are we? Well... I know you're mad that I did this. And we don't have to live here, it's not definite, but... I thought you might want to see it. - Are you going to get the bags? - No, leave it, leave it. - Kurt! - Oh, he missed you terribly. We have to talk. - Who are all these people? - Mom, I told you... I know, I know, but it was too late to cancel the caterers. and I thought what a wonderful way to met you neighbors.... That's OK. Hi! Crowd: "Hi!" I'm Lucy. How are you all? Your mother has been telling us about all your adventures. Grace and Jonathan live right next door. I'm just so glad that somebody bought this terrific house. Gracie helped me with the guest list. They know everybody in town. - Now ask John about the country club. - Yeah, do you play golf? He would love that. And Lucy could swim or play tennis. Okay. Girl, you look so cute, my goodness we miss you. We really do. Oh, well... - Are you ever gonna come back? - What do you think? - Will you excuse me for a minute? - Thanks for inviting us! Hi. Hello. Want my drink? You can throw it in my face. That won't be necessary. That's strong, though. - Great house. - Thank you. You know, I really have you to thank for it. Because when we were together ...and you said that whole thing about about holding each other back. You know you were right. OK... No, really, because I have Ben, and this house, and... - You, are you partner yet? - No, not yet. - You didn't introduce us. - I would like to know who did. She grew up next door. She didn't need to be introduced. She was just there. Oh, stop it. - Well, where is Lucy? Let's met her. - Yeah, enough of the mystery. Oh... I saw her around here, somewhere. She's ah... Well, she's talking to somebody right now. So, how's Hawaii? Ah... uh... oh... uh... ah... Ben? Yeah... uh... No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just... uh? Honey? - Ben? What's wrong? - I don't know... I thought... I'm fine. I'm fine. Met our neighbors. These are our neighbors. This is Lucy. -Thank you so much! -You're welcome! Everything was delicious! Honey, I'm going to get going. Oh, Oh, don't wanna come in for a cup of coffee? No, no, no. I am so exhausted. I'm fine... Well, if you're so tired, maybe you should spend the night. Welcome home. That was fun. - Did you have fun? - Yeah. You scared me though... You almost fainted. Yeah? Yeah, I should get some sleep. Saw you talking to "Steve Mason". - Yeah, he was here... - He's an asshole. I am well aware of that. You're not jealous, are you, Ben? - It's just he's sooo... - Ben, shut up! If anyone's gonna be jealous here, it's gonna be me! OK? I saw you talking to that neighbor! In fact, get out of here! Go sleep on the coach! I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I love you so much. I know. - But you... (Blows on her neck)- Pppphhhttt!!! Ben! Oh... Uh.... Uh... Ah... "Our latest victim, Leslie Singer, is presumed dead... "at this point, missing for 3 months. The search goes on... Ben. "These are all the locations where the girls were taken... Oh, my God. "...by Det. Waylon... Oh, God. "3 girls missing from the Council Buffs area of Iowa. "All of them have blond hair. They are 5'6" to 5'8" and weigh 110 to 135 lbs." I decided it would be fun to dress up one of the rooms with Ben's... old toys and trophies from school. I would hate to see what it looks like down there! Ah... this is really not an opportune time. Thank you so much! It's gonna mean so much to him... - Oh, but I've been waiting for Carl. - Carl? - My trainer? - OK, go ahead, and I'll lock myself out. (Car honks horn) - "Lucy? - What, Ben? "I love you." Ben, why not just try meth while you're at it. Now you're showing me this? I was here three months ago, I asked if you knew her. - I don't think it was me. - No? I forgot about it. She never came back. I haven't... I'm gonna need your surveillance tapes. Copy of all your receipts. We'll get that. Come on, Chris. What can this be? Did you slip on a banana peel too? Door bell: "Ding Dong!" - Hello. - Hey! I'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday, Mr. Keller. I'm Det. Waylon, and I'm working on... ... the Leslie Singer case. - What? - Leslie Singer. She's the... well you may not know. She's the young... Whoa, Kurt! - I'm sorry! Are you OK? - I'm Fine. - I know this bird. - Oh! We're gonna go for a ride, ladies. Won't that be fun? Sorry, but I had to dig you up before the new owners did. I'll come back for you guys. Well, tons of people bought lottery tickets that day. - I bet even Leslie bought one. - Why do you say that? Oh... Oh, well... Everybody wants to win the lottery, don't they? 36 million? You know what you should do? You should find all the people that bought lottery tickets that day... - And ask if they saw her. - That's a good idea. Except, I can't do that. People, for the most part, use cash to buy tickets. The only person I know who bought a ticket that day, was you. Why? Because you won. That's right. Well... I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. My card is on the picture there. I will. Ah, I gotta ask you something. What? What's it like? Oh... ah... Well... ah... You know how they say your life totally changes? Uh, huh. They're not lying. You're a lucky bastard. God speed! "I have 3 dead ladies, lying in my car... "My husband killed 3..." Ahhh... Hello? Yes? What? OK... OK. Will do, good bye! "My husband killed..." - Shannon, get Brentford out of the pool. - Oh no, that's OK. If I can wander around in my pajamas, your dog can swim in my pool. You can wander around in your pajamas any time. So Grace, what is it you do? - I'm a family planner. - I'm not sure what that is. - John, are you doing OK on that drink? - I'm fine, I must say. I mostly work with inner city families, single parents... - Shannon... Is she home from college? - Northwestern. Oh... great! That's really great. "I've got 3 dead girls, in my car... "3 young ladies, that look just like me... "And I'm bringing him chicken..." Who's hungry? What happened? Oh!... Oh, my God... Oh. What a funny story... Where did you go? What? Um... Oh, you know... - The Garden Center. - The Garden Center... Wait a minute! So... I am... just Leaning over looking at the Azalea's, and I tripped and fell... And landed in a pile of mulch... Oh, you poor thing!. Crazy. All the flowers are dead. I mean it's a terrible location. I mean it's like... whoa! Honey, I think that maybe ah... you should... maybe you should go inside and get cleaned up. Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine. Hi Grace, How are you? Hi, Grace... Oh! Sorry. - And ah... - Jonathan. Jonathan! I haven't seen you guys since... You know, the... welcome home party, right... that was...? How long ago was that? That was last night, wasn't it? Was it? And this is Shannon, our daughter. Lucy honey, you're shaking like a leaf. - Well that's a very pretty young girl. - Thank you. Thanks. Shannon is a sophomore at Northwestern. Do you wanna think about maybe... changing your hair color? Do you wanna think doing about that? Why? Well, aren't you afraid of that "Council Bluff Killer"? Lucy! Right, that is what they are calling him now, right? And you are exactly his type. Right... am I right? Right? - Am I wrong? - Well, maybe you should, Shannon. We can't let some lunatic govern how we live our life, Grace. - We can't? - Lucy! She's OK, she's OK. Honey? Honey?? - Sweetie, are you OK? - She alright? Should I... She's OK, she's OK. Honey? Does anyone want chicken? - I say that's dishonest. - No, Lady bugs. Are Lady bugs the one's that bite the heads off their husbands? No, that's the Preying Mantis. - Hi. - Hi. Come on in, Lucy. - Oh, no, you don't want me. - Come on. Don't be shy. Is it cold? No. It's great. It is great. Are any of you guys married? - It's strange. - What's it like? - I don't know. - They say communication is the key. And honesty. - Once the check comes, I'm outta here. - Right, that will happen... I am! It's not that easy. He can't hurt me. It's all about me. - What are you doing? - What? You shouldn't be out here, you need your rest. I just wanted to try the pool. Here. It's fine... You should come inside. I don't want you to catch a cold. I'm fine, every thing's fine. Come to bed. Let me swim some more. I'll be in soon. OK. Just when I thought I made some new friends. I'm sorry you guys. I really I'm. I just... I know what I'm doing. Well, you're up early. - Gardening. - Ah. I hope you're feeling better... ... you scared us to death. Yeah. Very dramatic, I am. This thing has everyone spooked. You're not alone. We just all have to keep a close eye on each other. You're right! So, how are these famous Azaleas? The what? The... From the Garden Center? Hey! Hi. Let's eat. - Is it there? - No. Well, it will get here. - Well? - No. - Is there someone we can call? - I did, and it's a recording. We're out of eggs. Sorry. That's OK. You know that this will never happen again... now that you and I are... you know... ...really a team. I mean, together, we'll make sure this never... - I think I'm pregnant. - What? Maybe, I'm not... I don't... I'm not really sure. I guess it happened in Hawaii, if I even am, I don't know... Oh, God... OK, well ah... We gotta get one of those ah... one of those test. Or... Mom will know what to do. No, Ben, hang on. This is fantastic. This is great. Ben, it's too early to... Mom, guess what?... You're just gonna get all worked... It's probably nothing! - Lucy's pregnant. - Oh, God, no... But we don't have any money for one of those test. What should we...? OK. OK, OK. Ben... So mom is gonna go and buy one of those test. and you're gonna go over her house and you're gonna take it... I'm just asking you to calm down, OK? We don't have to deal with this right now. Oh, my God! Where's the fucking check? I mean you're eating for two now, and all you have to eat is eggs? Jesus Christ... That's it. You're going to mom's, and I'm going to call the lottery. And I swear, where ever that check is, I promise you, it will be here when you get home. OK? Now go. - I gotta go get dressed... - No, no, no, no, just go, OK? Go. Now, Two lines, you're pregnant. One line, you're not. OK. Are you OK? You look exhausted. It's just been a rough week. How long is this thing gonna take? Oh... I remember while I was waiting to hear about Ben. I just thought I was going crazy. - Hear what about Ben? - If I was pregnant. You know, he loves you so much. You just mean so, so, much to him. At the wedding, you both looked so beautiful. And you! You looked like an angel sent from heaven. - Oh, well... - You did! Well then, I knew I could stop worrying about Ben... See, I'm his mother, and I worry. I know, that you will give him a good life. You've helped him so much already. You know. I know that... that you are the best thing that ever happened to him. You know what he does. I know that he loves you, and he needs you. Why didn't you tell anyone? There's nothing to tell. What are you talking about? Lucy, it's one line. It's OK. Oh, honey you've got time... Look, it will happen when you least expect it. I promise you! Oh, honey... Yes! Rosemary is not having a baby! Oh, my God! Finally a little luck! - I don't understand. - Nobody is buying that anymore. The first year of marriage is the hardest. I mean, that is what they always say... Fuck you! Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. I can't believe I just said that to you. - No, it's my fault. - No, it's not. I try very hard, but you know, when they grow up, and... however, whatever, whatever you did... Pauline, come with me. I have the car. Let's just go. Don't pack, let's just go. - Go where? - So I don't get the money, right?... - Who cares? - What money? Come on. Pauline... - No, no, no, he's my boy. I can't... - Pauline... No. I love you. Benjamin. How are you doing sweetheart? No, she isn't. Honey, I want you to listen to mommy now. (Cell phone ringing) Hello? "Hi." Hi. "Sorry, mom told me about the test." Yeah, I'm not gonna have a baby. "Yeah." Ben, I'm really sorry, but I can't do this anymore. "I've got the check." What? "It came right after you left." Oh? "See you at home." - Sorry about that. - No problem. - You're a busy guy. - Yeah. OK, Leslie... guy who bought condoms... Mom with scouts... a dumb kid... Guy buying cigarettes... A mother and child... Ben, I'm home! Hello? Ben? Don't look at me like that, I wasn't going to leave without you. Ben! Ben! Hello? Come on, Kurt. There you go. I know it smells like dead bodies in here. But you'll get use to it, Kurt. OK? I did it, Kurt. I did it. It's not like I planned it. But nobody can say I didn't do it. I got my bird, and I got my check. Your really gonna like Canada, Kurt, they have... Well, I actually don't know what they have there but... I just know that we're gonna love it. I'm mad at you. I don't know how to begin. I'm in shock. - Ben, stop it! - You know, I didn't believe her. I said you were just upset because you weren't pregnant. Now that we are a team. Do you have any idea how disappointed I am? I'm not gonna sit here and listen to a lecture from you. Yes, you will! Ben, Ben, Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben.. Ben... You can't hurt me. Remember... remember our little talk...OK? So, let's just calm down. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm realistic. Now, I know that marriage isn't easy and that... I may not be experienced in the ways of amore. But I know that. Ben, listen... I ah... might have married you under false pretenses... But, after spending time with you, I came to really... ... you know, to really, really... And then you started killing people, Ben! And it's just too much! Marriages take work. This has been our biggest mistake. We have just been sitting back... Hoping for a miracle. Well, I've done a lot of the work already. Now, the first thing I did, was to eliminate all distraction. BEN!!! That hurts!! This hurts. Your... When you kill people, you are hurting me, and you can not hurt me! OK, now you're just getting me on a technicality. Alright, come with me. I want to show you something. Help! Lucy! I really need you to be coherent. I went to a lot of trouble here. Ben! Now, Grace here, is gonna help us get through the rough spots. I can't do this, I can't do this... Leave, and she dies. Lucy, honey, please sit down. Let's try and act like adults. OK. Grace, scream, and I cut you. OK, Grace... when you have gotten yourself together. I'd like for you to tell me and Lucy... What it is we are doing wrong. I told you... I'm a family planner, not a marriage counselor. - I don't even have a degree. - It's the same ballpark. Ben, let her go! Just say... something. Is your marriage based on honesty, and mutual respect? Yes! No, it is not, Ben. I married you for the money, and you like to kill people. No... like to kill people? What? - They're burned in the yard? - I don't put them there! That was all you. I thought you were trying to help me there! Garden Center? Wink... wink. Here I thought we were a team. - A team? - Who did you kill? Grace, have you ever wanted something, so much... And when you couldn't have it you had to argh... - ...but you couldn't. - You're insane! - I'm not saying I'm proud of myself. - You seemed like such nice people. - Stop talking! - Such nice people! We are still nice people, but we're also in love... And love is scary, I'm starting to realize that now. I don't love you. - Yes, you do.. - I want to go home. Well, that depends on my partner here. Ben, You have a long ways ahead of you, OK? Don't live it like this. I'm not worth it. Not by a long shot. - I love you. - I don't love you. I love you. - Let me go!! - Let me go too! All I want is to be able to kiss, you... and have you kiss me... And to feel you mean it. That's all I want. Ben, I don't know. Maybe if... - ...I hadn't been so... - Greedy. - And you hadn't... - Killed all those people? - ...killed all those people. - Maybe things... - Would have been different? - I wish they were. I really do. Suddenly, the money doesn't seem to matter much, does it? Grace... Lucy! Lucy, we're not done talking! Get back here! Lucy! Please, don't leave me, Lucy! Look at what you did! Lucy... I can't take it anymore. I can't take it... Just take something sharp, and stab me with it, and kill me with it... Bury me under the hedges with the rest of them... Excuse me. No one answered at the front door. Is everything OK? Detective! Mr. Keller, I need to ask you a few more questions. Do you mind if we go inside? - I ah, don't mean to be rude, but... - But what? Well, we're swimming here. So if you could maybe come back, tomorrow? Mr. Keller, I reviewed the surveillance tape from the... convenience store where you bought the ticket. Yeah? You're not on them. Excuse the mess. I'm still unpacking. Fine. I understand. So ah, you're asking me how I could have bought my lottery ticket... and still not be on the tape? - On point. - Well, you're obviously on the tape... ...he just looks different. He's been working out. He's bigger. Not that much bigger. You're on the tape, don't be stupid, you're drunk. He's drunk, he's been swimming. I know why I'm not on the tape. You're on the tape! Detective, are you accusing him of something? Because if you are... I snapped her neck in the parking lot. I never even stepped foot in the store. That's how I'm not on that tape. Marriage is based on honesty. That is what Grace said. Sometimes the truth hurts. I'm sorry. You couldn't hurt me even if you wanted too. Alright, I want you two to sit down. We're gonna take this as calmly as possible. The more calmly we do this, the better off we'll be. - I want... the check. - Well, you don't get anything. - Unless, it's me. - Nobody wants you. You can have me. Mr. Keller, tell your wife to give me the gun. - You don't win. I won't let you. - Gimme the gun. - It's not fair! - Put that gun down, Mrs. Keller. - Just admit it, Lucy. - What? - You love me. - Shut up! - Mrs. Keller, give me that gun. - Just admit it, you love me. - I don't want too! - Give me the gun, Mrs. Keller. Add it to the pile. Can you turn that up, please? "They were as nice as can be." "He invited us to lunch, just the week before." "Looking back... looking back, she doesn't remember that night at all." "No, I hit my head, very hard..." "What happened afterwards?" "Well, after she was home safe, everyone..." Is this really "The Sunny Mart"? Why would I lie? - Kurt says "hello". - What are you doing here? - No, no, I mean he actually says "Hello" - What do you want? I ah... I wanted to make that sure you're OK. Lucy, I didn't think it was gonna end this way. You didn't? I told them that it was me! Those women under the hedge... they had your DNA, or your fibers, or whatever... ...all over them. I mean, you shot Detective Waylon! I know what I did. What about, what you did? Well... I think, we should just put the past behind us... I asked you a question. How much does a jury cost nowadays? Is it expensive? Jonathan and Grace, they cost a lot of money, ...is there any money left? At all? Mom says hello. I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm gonna set you on fire. - Did you get any of my letters? - I mean it... fire! OK, OK, ah... I love you anyway. Wait, wait! I know you, Ben. And ah, pretty soon... Tonight even... You're gonna go home, and you're gonna get to thinking about me... How much you love me. How we belong together, and... How you still, don't really have me... And when some 27 year old blond woman, about 5'6", 125 lbs... doesn't come back from her aerobics class... Everybody's gonna know, what's, what. I don't expect to be here much longer. Not long at all. - I don't think that's gonna happen. - And then I gonna set you on fire! You may be right...ah you normally are, but ah... Since you've been here, I just... ...I haven't had that urge. It's not that I like the idea of you rotting away in here, I don't... Get out. - Get out! Get out... - It just makes me feel. ...and don't ever come back here! Ever! Guard! Guard! Hello, I'm ready to go back. Take me back! - I love you, Lucy! - I'm ready to go. Take me away! - I love you! - Screw you! Fuck you! Goodbye, Lucy! Ben, wait, wait! I have time, I still have time left... Ben. Ben! Yes? It's almost been a year now... I know. Would you like me to come back? Yes. Would you? Of course. Tomorrow? I'll be here. - Kurt spoke? - Yeah, I was at the house... ...maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, and ah... What did he say? "Hello" "Hello", that's what he says. Just "hello", all the time. Around... around the clock. Have you been working out? Aaahhh.... Ben, no skipping. You're screw it all up and turn puny again! I know, it's just... I really need someone to motivate me. It's so boring. Ben, what do you want? Somebody to hold your hand? You just have to get in there and do it! OK... Hey, just don't say "OK". Just do it! - OK. - Promise me. I promise. You gonna work that chest tomorrow? If you find any problems with this sub...
