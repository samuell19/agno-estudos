Have a safe trip. - Send my love to aunt Frankie. - We will. Wait, where's my purse? I have to have my purse. I think I saw it upstairs. I'll be right back. - [ Groans ] - It was here this afternoon. Why do people keep taking my purse and hiding it? - Oh, my god. - It's only a small drink. We're not gonna be here this long. I just have to find my purse. Haven't you seen it? It can't have gone anywhere. - Here it is. I found it. - Where was it? Right where you left it. Right on the bed. - Thank you, honey. - Okay. Oh, dad, okay, here. Now again, have a safe trip. And I'll see you guys tomorrow, right? I want you to go to bed early. Don't stay up late just 'cause we're not here. - No, I won't. - Just promise me that. - Of course. - And you be good. Don't worry about a thing. - Here you go, dad. Have fun. - Bye-bye. Harold, let me have a taste. Bye. Dina! - How you doing? - Fine. - How about you? - Good. All right. Oh! We'll get 'em later. Come on. I never made love in my own house before. In my own room. In my own bed. Jesus, Marie, I don't understand. You're always forgetting something. Oh, please, Harold. You don't think I did it on purpose, - for god's sake. - [ Groans ] [ Car approaches ] [ Car door closes ] Shoot. Oh, no! My parents. Dina, Dina. How could you misplace the checkbook? And what do we need it for anyway? We may pass a garage sale, and I want it. Dina, where are you? There you are, sweetheart. I forgot my checkbook, and your father's about to blow a fuse. And what about these groceries there? It was just an accident, mom. I'll clean this up later. I know where it is. - Oh, yes. - Great. Now let's get out of here. Okay. Hey, Dina, is this your shoe? - No, daddy. - Don't be silly. Dina wouldn't wear anything ugly like that. - Well, then whose is it? - It's Bobby's. Bobby's? Where is he? He just wouldn't leave his shoe around here. No, he's upstairs in the bathroom. Hello, Mr. Wesley. How are you doing? - I'm fine and you? - I'm doing okay. - Hi, Mrs. Wesley. - Hi, Bobby. Honey, come on. We have to go. We have to be there before dinner. - You drive safe again. - Marie: We will. - Now you clean up that mess. - I will, mom. - Marie: Bye-bye. - Enjoy yourselves. [ Sighs ] How long will they be gone? Till tomorrow if they're not back in five minutes. Come on, let's go. Is this the way it's supposed to be? Yeah. Anyway, I think it is.

Trouble. No trouble at all. Well, if it isn't a little punk afloat in the sea. Morning, punk. Why don't you and I go down to Charlie's and you get your lunch with me? Sure thing, dugie. Dina: Oh, man. Can't you guys do anything but fight? Really? Why don't you try something original like swimming? Can an ox tread water? It's okay with me, punk. You wanna race? I'll get my suit.
