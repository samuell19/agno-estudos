[dramatic orchestral music] [Irishman] Northern Ireland is occupied territory. Exploited, unhappy. And as long as that state of affairs continues, you'll always have trouble. Check! [Englishman] That's your excuse, is it, for a gang of IRA hooligans who try to terrorise us by setting off bombs in half the cities of England? It's not an excuse, it's an explanation. Hmm! And I suppose you wouldn't object if Englishmen started chucking bombs about all over Ireland? Sure, isn't that what you've been doing for the past 300 years? Only you put the men in uniform to make it legal. There's a difference between using soldiers in uniform to keep the peace - and gunmen to break it. - The peace, is it? It's hard for an Irishman to see anything peaceful in a rifle that's pointing the wrong way. There's never been an English rifle pointing at a law-abiding citizen. And how can any self-respecting Irishman be law-abiding when he can't abide the laws you make? You know, my dear Brannigan, sometimes I wonder how you and I tolerate each other. [chuckles] There are two reasons as far as I can see. Firstly... I couldn't stand the sight of you for more than a week at a time. And you never come to Ireland for more than a week at a time. And secondly, your game of chess gets worse instead of better. On these terms, the friendship can continue indefinitely. Every summer, I go away vowing I'll never come back. Yet, even in the middle of a war, over I come. I suppose I think sooner or later I may convince you of something. That donkeys can fly. [chuckles] The trouble with you Englishmen is that you haven't got the imagination to know what it's like to be an Irishman. Maybe you have to be an Irishman to see the point of setting off a bomb in a crowded Tube station. - Sure, there was nobody hurt. - That's not the point! God heavens, man! We had enough to put up with in London at the time, without your young hooligans coming over with their suitcases full of bombs. I was as near to death as I am to you now. [man hums a tune] Watch it, you gom. Do you want to blow us all to smithereens? [knocking on door] Well, will you look who's here? The lady of the house herself. Come in, ma'am, come in. None of your blarney now. A young gentleman here says he's a friend of yours. Matt! Where did you drop from? [speaks Gaelic] - You're a sight for sore eyes. - Hello, Tim. Be damned, but this is a right surprise. It's Matt, Patsy. - Hello, Patsy. - Evening. - Well, how's things? - Oh, fine, fine. Oh, Mr Connolly, I nearly forgot. I'm collecting for a Spitfire fund. I shouldn't ask you, I suppose. I know you're neutral. But I thought you wouldn't be working over here if you didn't want to help us. You need all the help you can get, ma'am. They say Hitler's going to invade England, occupy six of the northern counties and found a new kingdom. And do you know what he's going to call it, ma'am? No. The United Kingdom of Great Germany and Northern England. - Isn't it shocking? - It's diabolical! I think simply diabolical. Mr McGuire? Come on, Patsy, they're not using Spitfires against Ireland. Not yet at any rate. Thank you very much. I know you're all really British at heart. - [air raid warning] - Oh, there it goes again. I'll see you under the stairs, Mr Connolly. - Yes, ma'am. - Don't forget the cards, will you? I want my revenge. - Where's Terence? - I'd give something to know. - He's not with you? - No. - Terry's not with us anymore. - What brought you over, Matt? I came to see him. I thought maybe he'd sent his little brother to do his dirty work for him. You miserable old rat! I'll put you through the wall for that! Easy, Matt, easy. Do you want the whole house in on top of us? What do you know about Terence? You might at least let him have enough wind to answer you with. I suppose it's you two who's been sending reports back to Ireland? Well, after all, Terry's been acting queer, like. He was the one planned it all. He ought to be here by now and he hasn't shown up. It's a nice feeling to think you're maybe working with a traitor. Terry's no traitor and you know it. Something must have happened to him. - Something happened to him all right. - Easy, Patsy, easy. We don't know. We know he left us to do the work for him. You can shut your gob if that's all that's worrying you. I'll do whatever it was that Terry had to do. Better hurry up then. - It's after 11. - You don't mean...? [German bombs exploding nearby] Why not? Isn't our job to plant it, is it? There's a Tube station half a mile up the road, the way you came from the station. The last train going north leaves at 11:27. Make sure you catch it. This is timed to go off at 11:30. - Just leave it behind in the station? - And be careful where you leave it. Remember what the Army Council says. "This is a gesture of protest. There must be no unnecessary loss of life." - Supposing there's an accident? - Don't worry, lad. If the British don't shoot you first, we'll shoot you afterwards. Good luck now. Here, just slide the catch. This one. [German bombs exploding nearby] [dramatic music] [German bombs exploding nearby] - King's Cross. - King's Cross. Thank you. Yes? [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] [ticking] [Tube train rumbles] [girl] Let's have a game of tag. You're it, Chris! I say, let's change to hide and seek. You hide your eyes and count. Don't cheat! Hey, it's ticking. So it is. - Hey, mister, it's ticking. - [guard] Mind the doors! Sounds like a clock. You never know. Better take it to the police. The IRA again, I suppose. - [bomb explodes overhead] - Coals to Newcastle. [grunts] [dramatic music] [panicked shouting] Confounded Irish. Won't even let us get on with the war in peace. Well? I'm after coming up the wrong stairs. You're Irish. Yes. Why didn't you use the proper exit? I got off the train and came up the first way I saw. Can I see your ticket? - What seems to be the trouble, Constable? - I caught him climbing over this gate, sir. Oh? [indistinct chatter] He's Irish too, sir. We can't charge every Irishman we pick up coming through the wrong gate. All right, off you go. Thank you. [German bombs explode in the distance] [telephone rings] Hello, Terry. - What the devil are you doing over here? - I came over to see you. I had to see you. You didn't need to go blowing up half London to find me now, did you? What went wrong, Terence? The boys were expecting you. I was in at the death, wasn't I? - Were you down on the platform? - I was. There was no one hurt. No one? Maybe a rat or two but none of the English variety. - Terence, you're still with us, aren't you? - Now, look... We mustn't be together, see? And if you're followed, don't lead them back to the boys. - That's what I wanted to tell you. - Are you still with us, Terry? One thing at a time. Let's get out of here first. - Terry, I... - Come on, out with you. I want an answer first. [German bombs explode in the distance] [German bombs explode in the distance] - Okay. - Up with you, Tim. I'll take over your hand. Oh, it's unlucky to leave a game of cards when you're winning. - It's a thing I never do. - Come on! It's about time young Matt here was initiated into the mysteries of fire watcher. - What do I do? - Ah, nothing at all. It's a complete waste of time. Nothing ever happens. And if it does, you just give me a shout. [he hums "The Moonshiner"] [he sings] ♪ A long way from home ♪ ♪ And if you don't like me ♪ ♪ Then leave me alone ♪ - He's still inside. - You take the back. You two, come with me. [German bombs exploding] [dramatic music] Hey, Tim, Patsy! It's the police! Look, there's the other one up there! Get up to the roof. [man whistles "The Moonshiner"] I thought you'd come to us here. We planned to use it in case we were ever cornered. The boys didn't get a chance, did they? You informed on us. I may be a bit of a traitor, Matt, but I wouldn't stoop that low. What's a traitor, Matt, anyway? Isn't it possible that he's only a man who's changed his mind? There's another name for that as well as traitor. Coward. [bombs rumbling] - Now, listen, Matt, I... - [footsteps] I don't think it's cowardice that's got into me, Matt. It's not easy to say you've been a fool all your life, condemn things you've grown to believe in and it's not easy to turn your back on people who have been your friends and comrades. I just began to think there are better ways of serving your country than dying for it, - that's all. - [bomb whistles] [bomb explodes] If we're not careful we'll be dying for someone else's country and that'd be even worse. [explosions rumbling] Come on, Matt. We always used to raise a laugh however tight a corner we were in. - We were on the same side then, Terence. - And we still are. The end's still the same. The means may be different, that's all. Terence, what's got into you? Can't you see...? Everything you believed in, I believed. Every step you took, I followed. We were fighting for the freedom of Ireland. I know, Matt. But I just don't believe we get any nearer to it by leaving a handful of bombs around in Tube stations and lavatories. Maybe if I'd stayed over in Ireland, I'd still see it as a crusade. But travel broadens the mind. So what they said was right. Well, you're wasting your breath if you think I'll ever agree with you. You're a great hand at giving advice, Terence. Maybe you'll take a piece of it yourself for a change. If you value your life, don't ever set foot in Ireland again. [German bombs explode in the distance] [bucolic music] [gunshot] Got him! You've got a good eye in your head. Ah, there's more satisfaction in getting it clean with a bullet than with blasting it with shot and it's better training. It's about time you had some practice with this. It's yours. You mean, I can keep it? It was your father's gun, Johnny. He didn't have it with him the night he was shot. Come on, boy. There. Ah, good dog. Clean as a whistle. You can count the hills through the hole in his skull. You'll do well, Johnny. You have a good eye. Come on, let's go. [wind blusters] Petrol's gone up again. That'll be five shillings. - And it's not fit to drink. - Everything's going up these days. That's a true word. The cost of food is so high, you can't afford to live. And it costs so much to get buried decently you can't afford to die either. We'll have to starve ourselves to death to save up enough to get buried with. [laughs] Here's your change. There's your mother, Johnny. Don't be telling her about the gun. I won't. - Hello, Molly. - Hello, Mother. You know the boy's leaving for Belfast this morning, Shinto. - Ah, there's plenty of time. - I've everything packed. Your mother wants you to herself, Johnny. It isn't every day that one of her brood flies away. Even if it is only over the garden hedge. I'll get my things. - I'll not be seeing you for a bit, Johnny. - I'm not going far, Mother. Sure, I'll be back here every weekend. I'll miss you, Johnny, but you're not to come back. I'll come up and see you in Belfast whenever I can get away. - You mustn't come back here. - But why, Mother? I... It's better. You've a new life to build, working in the docks and learning to be an engineer. I couldn't stay there all the time. Not in Northern Ireland. You must! Promise me you'll not come back. Not here. Promise. Why shouldn't I come back? It'll mean trouble for you, like it did for your father. I'll be losing you like I lost him. Do you want me to forget that he died and what he died for? [vehicle's brakes squeaking] Charlie Murphy! Something must have happened! [wind blusters] - So that's where Matt's got to. - Yeah, I might've known. Are you sure you're still safe at the garage here? - Why not? - Well, the boy's all right, and his sister. - But I'm not so sure about their mother. - Molly? She's never been the same since they got Joe. Don't worry, I can handle her. - Where's your sister? - In the office. Maureen. Maureen! Did you know Matt had gone to London? - Yes. - Why did he go? - To see Terry. - What about? What about? How should I know? [sighs] Young fool! And you're no better. Playing around with him while his brother's away. - Is it my fault if Matt's in love with me? - Yes! - Slinking about the place... - I'm in love with Terry. - Matt knows it and you know it. - Terry, is it? Well, that makes the pair of you. You unfaithful to Terry over here. - And him unfaithful to us in England. - That's not true. Ask Patsy McGuire, when he comes out of jail. Will you look who I picked up on the road? I think he would have worn his legs off if I hadn't gone for him. And would you guess where he's been? In London, if you don't mind. Dancing about on the rooftops while Connolly and McGuire was taken prisoner under his feet. I think I'd better tell Shinto the boy's back. Wake up. Wake up. Did you see Terry? Yes, I saw him. Is it true? - Yes, it's true. - He admitted it? He tried to justify it. I still don't believe it. - Terry wouldn't turn traitor. - Well, Matt... So you thought we were wrong about Terence? Shinto, I had to go. Now you've come back to retrieve the family honour. I'll do what the two of us could have done. With Tim and Patsy thrown in for good measure. If one man can do the work of four, I'll do it. He'll be going out in his pelt next with a hurley stick under his arm to fight the might of the British Empire. We'll give you a chance to prove you're a good Irishman still. See you're ready for it. And see you take it. And if it's your mother you want to see, Johnny, I'll come up to Belfast. Don't you come back here. I'm an Irishman, Mother. I may work in Belfast, but I'll never be at home there. You just say that now because you're going away. Once you've been up there for a month or two, we won't even get a letter from you. I'd like you to take this along with you, Johnny. You know whose it was. Thanks, Mother. [bus horn honks] I'll remember. Promise? You won't come back here, Johnny. Goodbye, Mother. [wind blusters] - [barman] Ten solid years. - [Shinto] Someone will pay for it. Mind you, they were good customers, Tim and Patsy. I'll never forgive you for sending them over to England. - Yeah, they were good men. - Ten years. Can you imagine Tim Connolly not seeing a pint of porter for ten solid years? Be damned, when you come to think of it, it's a terrible punishment, isn't it? Give me another glass, Harry. You're after making me thirsty. - We'll have two pints, Harry. - Two pints of stout, right. - Have you heard the news? - I've got better news that for you. They're bringing them over to Belfast. Tim and Patsy? To the Crumlin Road jail. When? We don't know. That's what you've got to find out. Have you got anybody inside of Belfast Docks? Sure, leave it to me. Once we know what boat he'll come on, we can easily... Thanks, Harry. [owl twitters] Where's Matt? He went to the pictures with Maureen. What sort of an army does he think we're running anyway? Ah, see, you get time off even in the army. [truck revs] Is there something on? Connolly and McGuire are being brought over to the Crumlin Road jail. - When? - That's what we've got to find out. Can we? They'll have notice at the harbour what boat they're coming on - and Johnny's working at the docks. - Johnny? - Why not? - Well, he's still only a kid. He's an Irishman. The place is stiff with sentries and they're armed. They shoot first and ask questions at the burial service. - Matt will be there. - Matt and Johnny? You'll want a whole battalion to do anything at the docks. If you ask for trouble. But you don't have to. Tell Matt to report the minute he gets back. [dramatic music] Maureen, I've forgotten I ever had a brother. You can forget him too. Can you forget something that's part of yourself? If you put something in its place. Only if it comes and asks. Maureen, you're living in the past. And you're afraid of me because I'm here telling you the past's dead. Hey, Matt. If you can spare the time, Shinto would like to see you. - Tell him I'll be along. - You'd better go now. - Why, is there something on? - Something big. Some boys have all the luck. He's going on a job. He'll be back with you tomorrow night. If the ruddy Specials can shoot better than I think they can, I'll be proud to deputise. [poignant music] You'll not destroy his memory as easily as his letters. - Terry's a traitor. - A traitor, is it? It's an easy word to use. A man can't be true to himself without being a traitor to something. He betrayed Ireland and the men he was working with. Were you there? [dramatic music] Maureen, I'm going to Belfast. Molly, is there any message I can take to Johnny? Just in case I should happen to bump into him. What do you want with Johnny? Nothing, I just thought I'd look him up if I had the chance. I'd rather you didn't see him. He's better away from you. Give Johnny my love, Matt, and tell him I'm proud of him. Leave him alone, Matt! Leave him in peace. Whatever you say, ma'am. Well, I... I'll have to be off now. It's Johnny he's gone to see, isn't it? It's Johnny! And what if it is? You should be proud of him. The way I'm proud of Matt. Aren't you the lucky boy? Going out on a job on your own. [laughs] - How does that feel? - That's fine. I'll get you some more ammunition. Many a good scrap has been lost for the want of an extra bullet. Take these in case you have to make a fight of it. Bye, Matt. I'll be thinking of you. [dramatic music] Good luck, Matt. I hate to be missing it. I'll be seeing you. [dock horn blares] Johnny. - Sorry I'm late. - I've got to get back. OK. Now, listen... What you're looking for is a letter from the London Metropolitan Police. It will have details of the boat that Tim and Patsy's coming over on. Where will it be? That's up to you when you get inside the dock office. Is that all I've got to get, just a letter? Johnny, you mustn't bring it with you. Take a grip on yourself. Memorise everything in the letter and leave it where you find it. - Sure. - And don't start anything - till after the shift when it's all quiet. - Yeah. - Remember your story when you come out. - Yeah. You know where I'll be waiting for you? Good luck. Thanks, Joe. - Terence Sullivan. - Barney. Not so loud. The name on my card is O'Shaughnessy. Well, fancy running into you, Mr O'Shaughnessy. I, er, hear you've lost poor Tim and Patsy. In jail, poor men. Ah, there's no devilment the English aren't up to. There's a rumour that they're bringing Patsy and Tim over here to the Crumlin Road jail. - Would that be what brings you over? - First I've heard of it. No, I've got some unfinished business with my young brother. - Well, so long, Barney. - So long, Mr O'Shaughnessy. [wind blusters] No sign? They should be here by now. If anything went wrong, Matt would be sure to phone. Unless he was taken. Maybe it's at this end, maybe they were caught on the border. Do you think I should slip up there and see if I can find anything out? [telephone rings] Hello? - Yes. - Is it Matt? We've no mechanic here at this time of night. I tell you, there's no one here, get off the line! Shouldn't Matt have phoned by now? Wouldn't it be better maybe if you didn't ask so many questions? Right, wheel! [telephone rings] Matt? What the hell's happening? Johnny's still inside. How do I know what he'll do? He'll probably wait till it's quiet, then carry on. Now, listen, as soon as Johnny's got the information, phone it through. Don't wait till you get here. There may be trouble at the border. That's right. Good luck. There's a troop ship disembarking. They've had to wait. The ruddy war again! Always getting in the way. [brakes squeaking] Petrol. [they speak indistinctly] - How many? - No petrol, thanks, darling. - [Terry] Thanks, Steve. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Maureen. Goodnight. Don't look so please to see me now. What does it feel like to be a traitor? Well now, that all depends on what you're betraying and how you go about it. You betrayed Ireland. There's two sides to that. And you went about it over in England, far enough away not to be afraid. A very sensible precaution. I'll call Shinto when I want him. And you were the one who used talk so big. We'd die in a free Ireland, you and Matte and I, or die to make her free. Poverty, oppression of the English, we'd fight them all. Quite a boy I was. Quite a boy. [footsteps] - Who's that down there? - It's me, Shinto. Let's get the talking over first. Who said anything about shooting? I didn't. Well... that puts the discussion on a friendly basis, doesn't it? And why not? I've only come to pay a social call on my brother. - Matt? - He's the only brother I've got. I thought he was over with you in London. That's queer now. I heard he was back here. With you, Shinto. Well, the man who told you that should pay the price of your ticket. You've had a long journey for nothing, Terence, my boy. I don't know. He may turn up. You never know. I tell you, he's not here! Matt hasn't been near the place for two months. If he was anywhere in Ireland, I'd be with him. So it's Matt now, is it? I'm in love with Matt. - If that's what you mean. - Well, its my loss. Matt's gain. Do you think you'll be happy with him? Wouldn't it be better if he was in a steady job? Coming home with a pay cheque in his pocket instead of a gun? If it means forgetting your country... I'd rather have the gun. [dramatic music] - Hello, Charlie. - What a night, eh? Sure, there's no man in his senses would be out on a night like this. - Except the army. - And the police. So long, Pat. - So long, Charlie. - So long, Mike. Hello. Looking for someone? What about a drink now? There's a wee place just round the corner. Sure, it won't take you a minute to get there in the car. - Do you want me to call the police? - Sure, why don't you call the sentries? Cos one of them's a special friend of mine. Anyway, I'll just be getting in out of the wet. - Who are you? - It's all right, I work here. - I've got my card. - Come forward. - What kept you? - Fell asleep in one of the sheds. - You fell asleep? - I felt tired after the shift. I lay down for a bit of a stretch and I must have dropped off. Okay. Thanks. Wait a minute! He falls asleep on his job. There's no reason why we should. You hold him here and I'll go and make sure everything's okay. Here, will you take this and clear off? Well, you have to be thankful for small mercies on a night like this. - Here, will you clear out?! - Don't worry, my boy, I'm going. [sentry] Up there somewhere! [engine starts] There he is! [gunshot] [gunshot] [tyres screech] [gunshot] - There's something wrong, Shinto. - He'll be through. A watched pot never boils, does it, Shinto? - What have you come back for? - I told you. I only want a little word with my brother. And where is he? Now, if I'm not at home, I'm at my job or round the corner at the pub. But if Matt's not at home, where is he? Where is he now? Can you be sure he's safe? Or is his hand tightened round the butt of his gun somewhere? Is that the man for you? He's a soldier fighting in an army. Ah, sure. That's what I thought when I went over to England. Do you know what I felt like after a bit? I felt like an anarchist in the middle of an air raid with a parcel of home-made bombs and a bagful of answers to questions that people have stopped asking. Maybe the question of Ireland's freedom is out of date in England? But we're still looking for the right answer over here. [Molly] There's something wrong. It's Johnny, isn't it? Johnny? It was Johnny that Matt went up to see, wasn't it, Shinto? I don't know what you're talking about. No? You killed his father, Shinto. Leave Johnny alone. - It was the English killed our father. - No, it was Shinto. Joe was happy enough until he told him he was unhappy. And he was free too till you told him he wasn't. And his fists were enough defence for Joe till you told him he needed a gun. It was the end of his happiness and his freedom. And it was the end of his life. He died for Ireland. Better had he lived for her, Shinto. The way he did before you came along. I thought maybe you'd seen things straight at last, Terry. I see I was wrong. Well, now that Molly's told us that Matt's still with you, I'd just like a word with him. You always were a great talker, Terry. But it wasn't talking that got us the 26 counties. And it won't be talking that will drive the English out of Ireland. And you're wasting your breath if you try to talk Matt into going soft, they way you've gone. Soft? Maybe you're right there. Too soft to come back and face up to you before. But I'm not so soft, Shinto, I'll let you make a gunman out of Matt. There's only two ends to that. If he's lucky, he ends up a gun happy lout that any decent man would destroy like a wild animal. Or if he's unlucky, he ends up in a quiet lane somewhere with a bullet in his guts and the life pouring out of him like the oil out of a broken lamp. [telephone rings] [telephone rings] Drop you gun, Flynn. - [telephone rings] - Drop it or I'll shoot. [telephone rings] [telephone rings] [telephone rings] Terry! Terry, it's you! - You're back with us. - Sure, I'm back. Shinto? I'm afraid he's not available just at the moment. Well then, listen, Terry. I've got to have help. I'm at Barrys Cross and the Specials are covering the border and I can't get through with the car and Johnny can't walk. What's wrong with Johnny? What is it? What's happened to him? He's been shot, Molly. But he's still all right. Matt, are you listening? Take the car up the track as far as she'll go. I'll be with you in half an hour. Whatever you say, Terry. You'll see that Shinto hears what's happened? Don't worry, Molly, we'll get Johnny to a doctor. [wind blusters] Move over, Flynn. That's enough, that's enough. Terry, we've got to know what Johnny found out. It's for Tim and Patsy. Do you want them to rot in jail? I think they'll be a lot safer there than back here with you! What was Matt's message? He sends you his love! But you must know where it came from? Sure, I'd like to help you. But I must have been out for a cup of tea at the time. Well, don't you keep a record of your phone calls? - Sure we do. - Well, then can't you look it up? - Isn't that what I'm doing? - That's what he's doing. Oh, perhaps Miss O'Flaherty may be able to help us. Oh! Miss O'Flaherty? Rosie? Well, that was Tim O'Connor on the line talking to the widow Reilly and the two of them canoodling like a couple of unknown creatures. Rosie, this is a gentleman from Fagan's Garage. He had a call there about a half an hour ago and he wants to know where it came from. It was young Matt Sullivan. I told you all about it. Is that the one, about Johnny Fagan being shot up in Belfast? - Where did it come from? - Tell me, is he badly hurt? - That's what we're going over to see. - Ah, curses on them anyway. - I can't get over the widow Reilly. - Where did the call come from? Just from a call box. I remember wondering at the time what would young Matt Sullivan be doing up there? - Where? - Imagine the widow Reilly! - Where? - Barrys Cross, it 'twas. - He'll have gone up the mountain track. - Thanks. Oh, don't mention it at all. The Post Office is only here to oblige. [engine struggles] [engine struggles and dies] [wind blusters] You've got to try it on our own now, Johnny. Can you manage? I phoned Shinto. He's coming to help us with Terence. Did you get the dope? Do you know boat they're coming on? Johnny? I've got to get you to Shinto. [dramatic music] Johnny, Johnny, we've got to get on. I've got to get you to Shinto. Johnny? You've got to tell me about the boat. When's it coming? Terry. - You all right, Matt? - Sure, Terry. Johnny's got it bad. It's his back. - We've got to get him to a doctor. - How about Shinto, is he coming? No, he's not. - He was there when I telephoned? - Sure, he was. He couldn't take the call. - Why not? - Tell you later. - What's all the mystery, Terence? - I'll tell you later. Now! Put away your gun, Matt. It'll get you nowhere. Matt, it was me that taught you the game. And that gives me the kind of right to take your education a bit further. And I'm telling you, there are better ways of getting what you want than at the point of a gun. Matt. You always trusted me, trust me now. Put away your gun. Let's get Johnny to the doctor and think up the next move from there. One thing at a time, remember? Come on, now. - We'll take him down to Dr Brannigan's. - That's still north of the border. Maybe Brannigan's house is in the north but his heart's in the south. Come on! Are you seriously telling me that you would defend the IRA? I'm not defending them, I'm attacking you! Look, Henry, we're only two miles north of the border. Down there, Henry, only two miles away, is Ireland. Free Ireland. The men who are criminals in England are martyrs down there. Huh! They're a bunch of hooligans! And what are the English? Great Britain is a world power and her army a recognised, legal force. The IRA, an illegal organisation. Outlawed even in Southern Ireland, even their own country. Answer that? Sure, we only did that to please the English. The boys are just as popular now as ever they were. Popular! Then that proves that an Irishman is a hypocrite as well as a rogue! What's an Englishman? A different kind of rogue. A more serious rogue. A much more accomplished one. And a damn sight more successful one! Good evening, doctor. - There's been an accident. - Bring him into the surgery. Easy now, easy now. Don't let him take his own weight. That's it. Inside now. Put him on the couch. Henry, get my bag. It's in there. - Who's he? - Easy, Matt. What sort of accident was this? He was up in Belfast, on business. - I think he was hit by a car. - A police car by the look of it. Something like that. That's why he wasn't taken to hospital. - Here's your bag. - Henry, another road accident. Oh, they're getting to be a terrible problem in Ireland. - Come on now, lads, outside, outside. - Come on, Matt. I'm waiting here till Johnny talks. Johnny won't talk for the next half hour, that's certain. - What have you done to him? - What have you done to him, Matt Sullivan? You've a good memory for faces, doctor. Considering the last time I saw his it was swollen with mumps. I've only given him half a grain of morphia to ease the pain. The both of you look worn out. There's whiskey in the next room. Take yourselves in and mix a good hot drink. The kettle's on the hob. Ah, sure you've only done what anyone would do, Matt. There's no one can blame you for bringing Johnny to a doctor. And I doubt if listening to your brother's a treasonable activity either. Don't think because I brought Johnny down here, I'm going to listen to you. I've gone to a wee bit of trouble to have a word with you again and you're going to listen to me. Now look, Matt, I'm just a good an Irishman as ever I was. But there's no future for a man, woman or child in the whole of the world till we've learned that an Irishman is the same thing as an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Russian, a German, an Italian or an American. When it comes down to it, man for man, there's devil a bit of difference. It's the way we're all separated out into different countries that causes the trouble. I've lived over in England, Matt. I've lived with the people and I've worked with them. They've the same hopes as we have, the same fears. They pay too much rent and too many taxes, just like we do. Scrape and save for their kids and their old age, just like we have to. It's not against people like that we should be working, Matt. It's with them. Can't you see it, man? Johnny's lying in there with a bullet in his back. He may not walk again. He may even die. And for what? For what, Matt? It's peace we want and security and a decent life. And we'll not get them by shouting ourselves alone at the top of our voices. I've done all I can. Hospital is his only chance. It's lodged in his spine. They'll have to operate right away. - Phone for an ambulance. - No! That's not the way Johnny would want it. - Now, Matt... - It's the only chance of saving his life. We'll wait in here till Johnny talks. Matt, son, I'm a good Irishman and I know the way you feel. But it goes very hard with me to see that young boy die, when the proper attention might save him. A human life is of greater value than the few words he might speak. There might be other lives depending on those words. Or wasted because of them. Well, I'm not going to stand here and see a man murdered. - Get back! - He'll shoot, Henry! I hope you're proud of him. A fine, patriotic Irishman. You're English. - And I'm glad you're not. - Do you think I want Johnny to die?! I think you're doing remarkably little to prevent it. If Johnny was an English soldier, you'd want to get the information back, even if it cost his life. But England's not at war with Ireland. But Ireland's at war with England. Johnny may not be slicked up in a uniform but he's a soldier and in an army. The Army of the Irish Republic. There's more than one way, Matt, of fighting for Ireland. Your way may be the right one or mine. But there's only thing that's right for that boy. Give me Dunmurry 2-5, please. Better this way, Matt. Dr Brannigan speaking. Could you send the ambulance over right away to my place? - Thank you. - Come on, Matt. Can we not wait till the ambulance comes for Johnny? It's too risky. Shinto can put two and two together. Come on now. Goodbye, Johnny. I tell you, it's the only place they can be. Johnny was shot, wasn't he? Brannigan's the only safe doctor for miles. They might have tried to get over the border. Terry? Don't you think he'd rather be up here than in the south? We'll see. Goodbye, Matt. We'll do what we can for him. Goodbye, doctor. Thanks for everything. [Johnny] Matt! Johnny! I'm here, Johnny. Are you all right, Matt? Yes, I'm all right. Where's Shinto? He's not coming. There something he must know. - You've got to tell him. - All right. The Ulster Queen. She's docking at 5:30... tomorrow morning. Okay. Can you say it back? The Ulster Queen, docking at 5:30 tomorrow morning. That's right. Won't forget? He'll be all right. Now, leave him. Well... Interesting gathering. I think we'll start with the collection. Roast duck, it was. I'll be lucky if there's a bone left by the time I get back. Sure, people have no consideration at all or they'd get sick at a respectable time. We'll get him out into the doctor's car. - You give him a hand, Matt. - Do you want the boy to die? How do I know that's the truth? If it was safe to move him, why I'd have called the ambulance half an hour ago. You're not staying up here, Shinto? What Johnny can tell us is worth waiting for. It concerns two old friends of yours, Terence. If you're planning an escape, you're wasting your time. Suppose there was a way of getting the boys out? I wouldn't lift a finger. Terence? They're coming across on the boat tomorrow morning. So Johnny talked and you've been keeping it to yourself, Matt? - [knocking on door] - It's only the ambulance. - I thought it wasn't safe to move him, doc. - Will I hole them, Shinto? - Let them in. - But, look, it's... Let them in! We don't need Johnny now, do we, Matt? What's the name of the ship? The Ulster Queen, docking tomorrow morning at 5:30. Good. You've been talking to Terry, Matt. One rotten apple can spoil the whole barrel. Well, we got you out in time, don't you think? Don't listen to him, Matt! Don't let him fool you. - Well, you've certainly taken your time. - And whose fault is that? We had a hell of a distance to come, hadn't we, Mick? They should have called the ambulance from Ballycarry. Just sitting down to our supper, we were. Roast duck. [Brannigan] Go easy with him now, his spine's injured. You know we'll do that, doctor. Easy now, easy with him. That's it. And do you think they'll leave us as much as a wing of that duck? Oh, not them. Will they, Mick? Well, waste no time in getting back to your duck. Sure, you know you can rely on us for that, can't he, Mick? - Can I give you a hand? - I wouldn't do that, Terry. - There might be another accident. - The service of humanity, that's our job. We'll do a bit of service, we'll get back to it, Paddy. [poignant music] Where have you been? - Walking. - You know where they are. - I don't. - You know where Johnny is! - You know what's happened to him. - I don't know anything. - Where have they gone? - After Terence, I suppose. And you hope they get him. He's a traitor, isn't he? He's gone to do what he can for Johnny. Your brother. And you'd rather they caught him and killed him. It's what he deserves. They won't get Terence. He's too good for them. And for you. And he'll take Matt away from you too and then where will you be? Matt will not turn traitor! If he does, you'll want them to kill him too. And then you'll be ready for another cheap thrill of the next poor lad that goes over the border with a gun in his pocket. Do you think I want Terry to die? Do you think I wouldn't rather he came back with us? I'm thinking it's death you're in love with. [dramatic music] How would you feel if it was you that was in jail instead of Tim and Patsy? Considerably safer than I do at the moment. Never mind, Matt. We'll give you a chance to retrieve the family honour. Connolly and McGuire will be walking off The Ulster Queen when she docks in the morning, but they'll have company. And we'll have a bit of a reception committee waiting for them. You're not going to try and bring it off at the docks? Why should you worry? You won't be there. - But it's suicide! - It's got to be done. We'll give them a reception worth coming over for, won't we, Matt? Sure. You're sending the boy to his death, Shinto. I'll see you all in jail for this! You too, Brannigan. - Why, what have I done? - Precious little if you ask me. I might have known when you were trying to defend these wretched gunmen, you were little better than one of them yourself. Me, one of them? I'm no such thing. I'm here under protest, the same as yourself. It's just a precaution in case either of you fancied a chat with the Specials. Why don't you stop the car? Because I don't want a bullet in the back of my head. I warn you, this is a technical assault! Would you like me to increase the charge to assault and battery? Oh! You're all the same. - Unprincipled, unreliable heathens! - So I'm a heathen now? A heathen? You low-minded, high-church compromiser! You contemptible hot-potch of a syncretist! You... Er, doctor, I like a good theological argument as well as the next, but you'll be passing the garage. Will you pull in there to the left? All right. You'll want to be alone for a bit, Terry. Think up what you're gonna say at the court-martial tomorrow. I can tell you now, you're making a mistake. It's a pity we're too busy to hold it now. But tomorrow you'll have the pleasure of meeting a couple of old friends who'll be giving evidence against you. I doubt it, Shinto. You think they'll be willing to forgive and forget? I think Tim and Patsy will still be in jail and you and Matt and the boys with him, if you're not blown to bits at the docks. We'll see. We'll pick up Charlie Murphy and the others on the way to the docks. Be ready to leave in five minutes. - I'll be ready. - If you feel like changing your mind, there's plenty of room in there with Terry. I'll not change my mind. Just the same, I'll be watching you. In there. Do you expect me to spend the night in that filthy hole? It's more comfortable than many a lock-up I've spent the night in and it's more than the regulation six by eight. - I think we'd better go quietly, Henry. - Go quietly? The police shall hear of this. What good will that do? You can expect them to take a little thing like this seriously. Little thing?! Why, you lawless rogue! You're as bad as the rest of them. Ireland's a hotbed of ill-bred, uneducated ruffians and as fit for independence as a tribe of heathen savages. Shut up! Ireland's a place apart. Something you've got no right to. Something sacred. It's as if you'd stormed your way into a cathedral and settled down in the nave, you and your countrymen. You ought to be ashamed of trespassing on holy ground. I told you before, Henry, you don't understand the Irish character. And maybe that'll give you some idea of what we think of the English. I told you I'd be waiting for you. Oh, the hero's return. All I did was drive a car. You brought it off, didn't you? Did I? Terry's been talking to you. Terry never stops talking. You don't mean you... I can think for myself. I'm proud of you, Matt. Save it for Johnny. He's got a bullet in his spine. If Johnny dies, it's the way he'd want to die. By an English bullet, like his father. That's the way we're all going to die by the look of it. [wind blusters] Matt? [poignant music] Maureen. Maureen. You've got to let me out. You're afraid of death, Terry, aren't you? Death only becomes easy when you've something to die for. It comes easy enough if you walk into it the way Shinto is planning. It'll be suicide at the docks, Maureen. Are you gonna let Matt die? - How can I save him? - By letting me out. If you were still in love with me, there'd be a voice inside me telling me what to do. But you killed the voice, didn't you, Terry? Ain't it a queer thing? That we who thought we were in love forever... should seem like strangers now. There's nothing left. There's your love for Matt. Is there? Say you'll come back to us, Terry, and I'll let you out. Say it was all a dream and we're waking up with everything as it was. They'll shoot you, Terry, and dump you in a bog. Wouldn't it be better to go out like Matt? With your head high and give your warm blood without fear in a great cause. Blood, that's all you want. That's all you all want. You're like Ireland herself that keeps crying out always for blood and more blood. Wouldn't you think you'd be sick of it all? Wouldn't you think the whole wide Earth would be vomiting blood from all the bright-eyed young fellas went out on their day? Mother of mercy, when will we all get sense? Thanks, Molly. I'm thinking if Maureen ever had a child, he'd be born in uniform with a Tommy gun for a rattle. [Maureen sobs] [Connolly whistles "The Moonshiner"] [ship's engine thumping] [whispers] I wonder if the boys have heard. Why? They might take a crack at it. Should think they've more ruddy sense. Now listen, Barney, stick close to the buoy, that's where they'll come off. When she slows down for the turn into the lough. - It won't be easy to see in the water. - Well, make for the buoy. It'll be as easy as meeting your girl by Nelson's pillar. Lend us that hat. Now listen, make sure you keep the clothes dry. We'll be needing a change. I will, Terence. - Where's the torch? - In the locker. It's a poor chance you have of pulling it off. Thanks for the encouragement, Barney. All right, let her go. Right off the port bow, sir. [seagull cries] - Port two points, quartermaster. - Port two points, sir. Thanks. Sure, it's a fine time to be running out of petrol with a tide like this running. We're off again. I wonder what that was. Picking up the pilot, I expect. Hang on, your deal. I see. Take him below and give him a hot drink. - Aye-aye, sir. - Thank you, sir. [whistles "The Moonshiner"] Sure, I thought I'd never see another day. [Terry whistles "The Moonshiner"] [tries to whistle] [both singing] ♪ I'm a rambler and a gambler ♪ ♪ I'm a long way from home ♪ ♪ And if you don't like me ♪ - ♪ Then leave me alone! ♪ - [guard] Stow it! We're in Irish waters now. Sure, we had to give old Ireland a bit of a welcome. Save it till you come out of jail. We'll see if you feel like singing after ten years inside. Ah, sure, that's why I thought it was best not to wait. [whistles "The Moonshiner"] - Wait here, I'll get the steward. - Thanks. Wireless message for D31, marked urgent. Get 'em up and keep quiet, both of you. [fog horn blares] They're moving the van in. They may bring them off first. Time we were getting ready. Give me them grenades. Are you sure that's the right way to do it? I'll keep the spare one. Just for safety. He knows how far ahead of the van to throw it? We don't want Tim and Patsy blown to bits in the back. We've been over it. Get the car up. Come on, Matt. Will you look where they're shifting the vans now? They've spoilt the view entirely. We won't be able to see the boys when they're brought off. That's sure enough. But you will be able to see the van when it moves away. - Now that's when you signal. - Where will you be? - Keeping an eye on things. - Matt? Would you look who's there, coming up the street. It's him all right. How did he get there? Keep your eye on the dock. Once you've signalled the van's underway, come down to the car. Hello, Matt. Terry! How did you...? Never mind that now. I've come to get you out of this. But, Terence, Connolly and McGuire. We can't leave them to rot in jail. Connolly and McGuire are halfway to the garage by now. Take his gun, Matt. Take his gun! A fine sense of gratitude you have, the pair of you. You know, Tim and Patsy were a bit more demonstrative. - You've seen them? - We went for a swim this morning, in Belfast Lough. It was perishing cold too. If you think you can save your neck by a story like that... It's no story, Shinto. Wait till the jailers come ashore. They'll be empty-handed. Get in. You too. Watch out for Flynn's signal. I tell you, Tim and Patsy won't be in the van. You'll see the jailers come ashore without them. We'll see nothing till the van comes out of the shed. And they'll be inside it by that time. You mean, you won't be able to see them come ashore? And we're not taking any chances, Terence, not on your word. Do you think I'd be fool enough to show up here if what I'm saying's not true? Why will the van be empty? Because Connolly and McGuire are halfway to the garage by now. You've an answer for everything, haven't you, Terence? We'll see if you have an answer for that. Fire under cover of the explosion. - You can't shoot a man without a trial... - There's no trial needed. - But you've no proof. - If it's proof you want, put your hand in my inside pocket. They're the bracelets they had on Tim and Patsy. Now do you believe me? Here she comes! [guard shouts] [dramatic music] Let's go. For God's sake, man, don't be a fool! The van's empty. He's safe enough. You two go with Murphy. [dramatic music] [boy] Ah, come on! Let's have it! [children shout playfully] Get down! [explosion] [gunfire] Murphy! [dramatic music] You'll go down in history, Shinto, as the man who lost two of the boys failing to open an empty van. - If it was empty. - You'll know soon enough. Tim and Patsy will be waiting for us at the garage. We'll see. A lot of help I got from you two. Fine reliable family, the Sullivans. There's no one will blame you, Matt. Just because it's fashionable nowadays to drop bombs on children, there's no reason why an Irishman should follow the custom. It lost us two men. If the escorts had have come out, you'd have lost more than Farrell and O'Brien. You're lucky we've only added three more martyrs to the role of Ireland's glory. Three? Do you think Johnny will ever walk again? [nuns singing] Johnny? Mother. Johnny. What is it, Mother? You're going to be all right, Johnny. You're going to be all right. Hello, Bill. Hello, Frank. Has he come round yet? - No, what's up now? - Bigger than we thought. There's been gun-play down at the docks. They'll hoping he'll give us a lead. We'll have to ask you to go, Mrs Fagan. We want to ask him a few questions. You'll not make him talk when he's like this? I'm sorry, Mrs Fagan. There's nothing he can tell you that I don't know. You want the name of the man that put him up to it? - Mother! - It was Shinto! Shinto... - Are the boys here? - The boys? - Connolly and McGuire? - No, should they be here? We've come to the last sketch in your little comedy, Terry my boy. - They're not here? - No, Terence. They're not here. They can't be long now. We can wait till they turn up, can't we? You're playing for time. Maybe you've given us away too and you're playing for time till the guards get here. But we're not waiting for that. We'll have to go through the formalities. [wind blusters] It's what he deserves, Matt. We made a mistake, both of us. And now it's all over. The way you wanted it, Matt. You've been found guilty of conspiring with the enemy to betray your comrades of the Irish Republican Army. And for that crime, it is the unanimous decision of this court that you be sentenced to death. You're making a mistake. No, you are. If you're lying about Connolly and McGuire, you deserve to be shot. If you're not lying, you still deserve to be shot for what you did over in England. I've done nothing either here or in England that can justify this. We'll take a chance. Johnny's dead. I'm sorry, ma'am. Yes, you're sorry. Matt didn't kill Johnny, Molly. No, it was the English killed him, like they killed our father. No, Maureen, it was you. And you, Shinto. Johnny was only a lad. He'd still be playing hurley and football, if you hadn't taught him the other game. You grow up fast when there's trouble around you. Trouble's where you make it. And I don't think Johnny was the kind to start wars and revolutions. He was just like most of us, the kind that gets killed in them. I hoped you'd see it, Matt. Easy, Matt, easy. Do you want to get shot with him? Right. All right, Terry.

You'll never know how glad I am to see yours. Why didn't you come straight here like I told you? Oh, we slipped into Harry McGrath's for a drop. Only a drop, mind you. You nearly had a drop too many, Tim. Didn't they, Shinto? It was a close call. Into the cars, boys, it's the police! Ah, there's no justice left in the world. Inside. Hey, Flynn, give it a twist! Come on now, hurry, hurry! Come on, Flynn, hurry! [gunfire] [gunfire continues] [wind blusters] Are you coming, Matt? [inspiring music] There's something completely irresponsible about the Irish character! Nobody but an Englishman would say a thing like that. And is it Ireland's fault if you've got yourselves into a bit of a scrap? A bit of a scrap? Why, hang it, man! - It's a war, a world war! - A world war? How can you call it a world war when Ireland isn't in it? If she were, you wouldn't find your situation so serious. To England, where the situation may be serious but is never hopeless. To Ireland, where the situation is always hopeless... but never serious. [triumphant music]
