(Directed by Kwak Min-seung) (Rolling) Coming! Wallet. Where's my wallet? Hi, I'm your real estate agent. What? Real estate? Your mom put this house up for rent two days ago. You didn't know? We're here for house viewing. No, no, no. - It won't take long. - No. - What? - Mom? What's this house viewing? I put the house up for rent. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't bother to reply to my text for over a week. That's because of your nonsense. How can I run your place alone? Unless you run this place while I'm away, - you move out! - Mom! - This house is not for rent. - I've got to go. This house is not for rent! Your food is here! Thank you. Can't you just close up shop? You said the business is bad anyway. Right, I close up shop. And you move out. Mom, I paid one-third of the deposit here. Remember? Cover for me or move out. Mom, don't do this to me. You are so unfair. No more conversation. You must come here tonight. I can't. I have things to do. Yeah, your games. - Check, please. - Okay. Gosh! How dare you smoke here? (SINNARA GIMBAP SEAWEED RICE ROLLS) The extended COVID-19 situation made people eat out less, which overburdens small business owners. While the income decreases, they still have rent and interest to pay. It turns out that ten out of seven owners are considering business closure. - The owners? Sure. - Isn't it burnt? But their workers and suppliers must be affected, too. - Yes. Naturally... - I can do that. Small businesses are directly hit by falling sales. And they will try to find a way to cut any and all costs. I see. See? Do it yourself. - Me? - Try. Let me do it again. Spread the rice thinly. - It's thin. - Use your fingertips. Spread rice up to here. Not enough rice. - More rice? - It's hopeless. I'll close up shop and put your house up for rent. I'm here to do it. Then do better. This is my first time, Mom. Carrots. They all look the same. Dried anchovies for stir-fry. It can't be wrong. Are you a newcomer? Please come in. Mom? Here you go. For this? I'm here for this? It's just sesame oil. Do I have to be here for this? It's not just sesame oil. It's the secret of Sinnara Gimbap. Add it to rice. Spread it on seaweed when you finish rolling. - Got it? - Yes. When you come next time, bring your grandma's favorite videotape. - Of my childhood? - Yes. It can't be at my place. It must be at yours. It isn't. Check out your wardrobe. I'll look. - And we meet in two days. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, I used to go to swim meets. - Here's your stir-fried pork. - Thank you. - Good night. - Good night. You came. Yeah, someone at a gimbap place ordered my homemade gimbap. Because I heard that your gimbap is so yummy. Have you eaten? Not yet. You head-and-tail eater. You finished all the ends of the rolls. The anchovies are too sweet. Can't we take it off the menu? Your version is spicy, but mine gets sweet. Use less starch syrup. A lot less. The cheese gimbap is okay. Why don't we just remove anchovy gimbap from the menu? Nonsense. Practice more. You said "more syrup" at first. You say "less syrup" now. Call me when you get there. Stop ordering meal delivery. - Always wear your mask. - I will. And quit smoking while you run the business. I will. Is Grandma very ill? - Let's hope not. - There's a cab. - Can you carry it? - Yes. Careful. To the bus terminal, please. Goodbye. - Go home. - Take care. I will. Ju-ri! I almost forgot. I was cooking for Grandma, - and I made some for you. - Side dishes? Guess! - Go. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. You can start now. (TEMPORARY MENU) Hi. Bye. Ju-ri? Hey, you shouldn't smoke in front of your place. Excuse me? I'm Auntie Chun-ja. From the bakery. Oh, hello. How's business? It's going. Here you go. - Is this your bread? - Yes. Let me know what you like. Thank you. Would you like some gimbap? Gimbap? Or ramyeon. I'll come back for lunch tomorrow. Bye now. - Keep up the good work. - Goodbye. You look great. - Ramyeon with cheese for you. - Thank you. Enjoy. Hi, Mom. Ju-ri. I see you in the living room. Where's Grandma? - She is sleeping. - I see. How was business today? It was okay. Everyone asked about you. Really? But I already told my regulars. Everything okay? Maybe I shouldn't tell them I'm your daughter. They talk too much. Some complained that it tasted different. Maybe it's because you used the wrong dried anchovies. I know. But I did use less starch syrup. Oh, the lady from the bakery came by. She'll come back for lunch tomorrow. I asked her to check up on you. You should visit the bakery and buy their stuff. I liked their red bean bread. I heard that you smoked again. I smoked outside. I was far out. Smoking outside is still smoking. Really, can't you quit while you're doing this? I get it. Okay. I won't smoke. I promise. You're hopeless. Mom, you have a regular who comes every morning, right? Lee-won? - Yes. - Did you take care of him? Does he never talk? Mostly. He is a good kid, though. He seems to be studying. I don't know much about him. But the boy has a good heart and looks nice to me. When you weren't answering my text or call, he helped me out. He did? Anyway, good job today, Ms. Kim Ju-ri. Right. How's Grandma? She is sleeping. I mean, you're there. Send me her photos. You only miss your grandma? Would I miss you, Mom? Okay. I'll send you some photos. Okay, go to bed now. You must be tired. - Okay. - I'm so tired. It's good to talk to you. - Good night. - Sleep tight. Okay. Bye. Check out the delivered food supplies. Put down chairs. Sweep the floor once again. (TAKE OUT YELLOW PICKLED RADISH) (FOR THE MORNING REGULAR!) (VEGETABLES) Hello. Hello. Yes, please come in. You don't have to be too polite to me. Where did you learn the language? On TV. - What do you want? - Anchovy gimbap. Anchovy gimbap? One roll? Yes. I wanted to have two rolls, but I ran out of my allowance this week. But why were you sleeping? Me? I wasn't. You were. I was tired. You must sleep at home. I know. Why did you put on a Band-Aid for kids? This? It was a gift. Who would give you that kind of gift? Well, someone sweet? Does he like you? I don't know. I guess not. Oh, there's Pororo! - Do you like Pororo? - Yes. - Who's your favorite? - Pororo. And then? That's it. Do you know Pingu? No. You don't know Pingu? No. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Do you come here often? Sometimes. How's my gimbap? I think it's okay. - You think it's okay? - Yes. Where have you been today? Home. I can't meet my friends. I'm always home these days. You must be bored. But I can't get sick. Right. Do you have a crush? I have a girlfriend. You do? Since when? It's been 34 days. Do you want to be his girlfriend? Me? I'm not sure. (AWARD) (GRANDMA, I PRAY FOR YOUR HEALTH) The orange jar is your eye cream, right? I packed some skincare samples, too. The videotape was at your house, not mine. Yes. It should arrive in two days. How's Grandma? Is she worse? What does the doctor say? Well, that worries me. Dinner? I'm about to have it. What about you? Look. Can't you help me out? Huh? I'm late for my test, and I forgot my transit card. The scooter out there... It's yours, right? Yes. Hey. Wait a minute. Hold on. - I think we just passed it. - What do we do? It's okay. I can run from here. - I really appreciate it. - It's okay. I'm running late now... - But I'll pay for this. - Okay. - Thank you. - Hurry. Wait, my helmet! - Hello, I'd like to order. - Hello. It's a volume order. - You get volume orders, right? - A volume order? Yes, we always buy 30 rolls when we are in this neighborhood. Can you hear me? We always order 30 rolls when we come here. We are alpine club members. We often go to Mt. Bukhansan near here. Have you been there? It's neither summer nor fall now, and it's fabulous in the mountains. You should come, too. We go there every year. And everyone wants your gimbap. When we go up, we must eat Sinnara's gimbap. So we'd like to order for tomorrow. Okay? But I'm doing this alone, so... But the owner was doing it alone, too. You can start rolling now. It's tomorrow. It's my 30th "Tuesday Hike" in the club. So I promised to treat the Bright Future Alpine Club to gimbap. But I can't make it myself. Then who should help me? Ms. Sinnara. Is it your name, Ms. Sinnara? No, I'm Kim Ju-ri. So, Ms. Kim Ju-ri, I desperately need your help here. I need my gimbap tomorrow. We only have four items on the menu. Is this the menu? Sinnara, kimchi, tuna, and anchovy? Your anchovy gimbap is impressive. Where are the anchovies from? They are fantastic. It may taste a bit different. Different means unique, which is excellent. So, we need 40 rolls tomorrow. I'd like to order 40 rolls. - 40 rolls. - That's right. 40 rolls. We are about 30 people, but I usually eat two or three rolls. Here's my business card. At 11 tomorrow, I'll pick up 40 rolls. Roll them tight and big. For one big mouthful, please. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Ju-ri. - Welcome. - Hi. Perilla leaves! You seemed to like it last time. - I appreciate it. - No problem. Enjoy. Thank you. How's business? I don't earn half as much as Mom. But I got a volume order today. Cool. How about you? We aren't any better. When will things get better, really? How's your grandma? She is worse. Your mom must be worried. Everything is going to be all right. That's one big wrap. Look at you. - It's delicious. - Is it? Are you closing? Yes. I owe you this morning. Did you ace the test? No. You should have. I gave up my morning business and got a ticket for not wearing this. I'm so sorry. I'll pay the fine. Have you ever rolled gimbap? No. Never? Never. What are you doing tomorrow? Nothing. Well, since you're sorry, will you help me tomorrow? Sure. You should roll gimbap. I'm rolling. 7 a.m. tomorrow, okay? Okay. 7 a.m. Have a good night. Goodbye. Too expensive. Hi. This one is on sale. We're offering a 20 percent discount. Why don't you try it on? It looks different when you wear it. - No, I'm fine. - But you should. - Bye. - Have a good night. You're here. Sure. Good morning. You want breakfast? Yes. Have a seat. Okay. Thank you. What are you studying for? For the TOEIC test and certificates of qualification. I haven't passed any yet. But it's okay. Why can't you eat yellow pickled radish? It's not my thing. Without yellow pickled radish, gimbap doesn't taste right. To tell you the truth, I'm allergic to it. Allergic to yellow pickled radish? Yes. Then are you allergic to white pickled radish, too? Like, do you have rashes when you eat them? Rashes or itchiness. You must be careful. But I can eat radish kimchi. Radish kimchi is okay? So you can't eat processed radish. Look, if it's okay, can you let me roll gimbap? Will you? But it's harder than you think. I'll try. Let me tell you how. Then you add yellow pickled radish. Can you touch this? - It's fine. - Is it? Add one strip of each... yellow pickled radish, egg omelet, and then ham. Hello, Sinnara Gimbap. Oh, good morning. They're ready. In the mountains? Delivery? Don't rush. Where are they? Ouch. I think we're almost there. Hurry. Hey! Ms. Sinnara, right? It was so hectic this morning. I'm so sorry. These are tuna and cheese rolls. You don't have to explain. You have a friend. I'm really sorry. I was so busy this morning. - Here you are. - Thank you. Please keep the change. Really, I feel awful. Thank you. And I'd like to order for next week. There will be about 70 of us, and I'd like to order 100 rolls. 100 rolls? By the way, we have fewer people than expected, so have some rolls. It's okay. We ate a lot. I don't think so. He looks like a gimbap kind of guy. Just a moment. How carefully you have wrapped it. Have a bite. It's so good. Thank you. The mountaintop is not far. Why don't you join us? It is such a fine day. What a handsome young man. Let's go. Sir, your chopsticks! Are you okay? I can take this much. - Are you okay? - Me? I'm fine. But it's nice to be in the mountains. The air is fresh. It's been a long while since I've hiked. Shall we... Shall we go to the mountaintop? Wait, we're not supposed to yell in the mountains. Why not? Because it scares animals. That makes sense. Thanks for everything today. No, I should thank you. Thanks for the Band-Aid, too. It's nothing. It has healed. - That was fast. - I know. Right. It's the gimbap you ate, isn't it? - I guess. - It's the yellow pickled radish. Yes. (FUCKED UP) (WE ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED) (GRANDMA, I PRAY FOR YOUR HEALTH) Hey. Were you smoking? I quit. Give me a cigarette. What? I want one. And the light? (2020 FALL RECRUITMENT) You didn't tell me you'd come. Do I always need to tell you? You don't have Zumba class tonight. I love drinking with my daughter. Take it easy. One more. Slow down. You're drinking too fast. Okay. I haven't seen Auntie Chun-ja for a while. How is she doing? Okay? A customer turned out to be a confirmed COVID-19 case, so she shut down the bakery. Oh, gosh. For how long? They say two days is enough. But the business is bad anyway. Chun-ja's thinking about closing it down for good. She should keep going. Auntie's bakery makes yummy stuff. - Ju-ri. - Yes? I put this place up for sale. Why? Slow business. But I can't quit until someone takes over the place. So... Until then, I'll keep going. Mom. Yes. I'm looking for a job because of you. A job? I want to stop being dependent on you. What job? I'm not sure. But I sent applications. There will be interviews. So please keep going. Don't say things you don't even mean. How can you let this place go? You are adorable. Are you crying? I'm not. Oh, my. Now, you're not so adorable. It's a bit... A bit too big for you. Still, you look good. Take it off. I'll sew a button on it. It smells like your wardrobe. Why did you drop out of college? I quit because I thought it wasn't for me. Then you can easily quit this job, too. No, that's not going to happen. Your TOEIC test score is low, and it's past the valid period. Aren't you too careless? I will do better from now on. Ju-ri, what are you good at, aside from word processing and driving? I am... I'm good at rolling gimbap. (RICE PORRIDGE DELIVERY) (SINNARA GIMBAP DELIVERY) Your gimbap is here. Hello. Hey, it's you! It's been a while. - Are you doing well? - Yes. You should've told me it was you. I would've given you extra. - For real? - Sure. - Enjoy. Bye. - Okay. Have a good day. - I'm sorry. - Why are you so late? The traffic was heavy. I told you I have Zumba class tonight! I came right back. You told me to drive safe. Be sure to close the accounts before you go home. If you pocket cash again, I'll fire you. I won't. - I'm leaving now. - Bye. $1.50. $1.60. (SINNARA GIMBAP) Jeez! Hi. It's been a long time. Yes. Why did you stop coming? I'm sorry. I found a job near my home. Did you? Wow. I brought mine. Do you want a ride? Mom. - Hey. - Chun-ja's here. - Don't. - What? Ju-ri? - Auntie's prettier. - What? I said Auntie's prettier. (SINNARA GIMBAP) Be careful. I will. - Are you holding tight? - Yes. You can't drive like this. Be gentle. You have a passenger. Gentle, right. Don't go rough. Okay. This is fun! (Rolling)
