SHUN SHUN FATT DINER Wait for me. Relax, we're just playing mahjong. Ah Fatt. Give me a helping of Three Great Scholars. Got it, no problem. -On it. -Be quick. LONG JONG YOU NIANG TAU FOOD ENTER THE GAME White Dragon, Red Dragon, Green Dragon. Isn't that the Three Great Scholars? Sassy, get to work. Pretty sure she's not here. Nancy, I've got your West Wind tile. -Let me send you to your doom. -Pong. Watch it, or you'll meet your doom. -Green Dragon. -Pong. You want to win? Dream on. Pong. Crap. Pong. Pong again and again. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Lian, you haven't ordered, what do you want to eat? I'm hungry, fish balls would be nice. I'm dizzy from all the Pong that is going around. I need a Panadol. -Just one capsule. -One capsule. White Dragon. Pong. Don't mess it up, can't you see she's on to a Four Large Blessings hand. Don't make me lose my grocery money as well. Will it kill you to just let me win once? Sure, the weakest hand shall prevail. Show me what you've got, I dare you. North Wind. You scared me. Tiger, you want a Panadol, right? I have one. Don't take everything you're offered. Even if you pick it up yourself, double check. Kong. Jinx, jinx, jinx... Kong again. Jinx, jinx, jinx... Kong...pay up, please. Here you go again. Three draws and you couldn't even get it, you'll lose for sure. It ain't over until it's over. Come on, Nancy. Move aside. Jinx, jinx, jinx... Three Circles. Self-Draw win. Four Small Blessings and three Kongs. How much do you think are the total winnings? I'm a newbie at mahjong but this seems like a big win. Haven't you heard of "the weakest hand shall prevail"? You watch out the ghosts might follow you home. If I knew I'd lose, I'd have gone home to watch my wives play mahjong. Come on, we're neighbors, don't say that. A little gambling never hurt anyone. We're just having fun. Come on, pay up. -There goes my money. -You little rascal. I asked you to pack Yong tau foo and here you are playing games. Stand right there, don't run. I will if you stop chasing me. Talking back now? Self-Draw win. The candy is mine. You'll even settle for a Chicken Hand? It'll bring bigger wins. Didn't you say you only play but don't gamble? That's why I only won some candy. And I'm the one who brought the candy. What's the matter? You want some? No, today you're going to learn how to lose gracefully. All right, let's learn about sharing first today. What's the matter? Don't you want some candy? Mr. Yang. Well, well, well, look who we have here. Wayne Yang. Haven't I told you not to gamble here after school? Which part of that did you not understand? We weren't gambling. Yeah, don't twist the facts we were just sharing candy. Did you see us gambling with your own eyes? Although no money was involved. But playing mahjong is gambling. And that's wrong. Playing mahjong doesn't necessarily mean we're gambling. I was teaching them mathematics and history. No, you were clearly gambling. Don't deny it. Deny? Don't you know? This isn't just mahjong it's the essence of our culture. Go! Mahjong is a card game created in China. Well-known and well-loved in the whole world. There are many different theories about its origins. Due to the fact that it's been around for so long. Some say that in 500 B.C. when Confucius was travelling all over China, he created the game, mahjong to spread his teachings. Using the three tiles of Red Dragon Green Dragon, and White Dragon to represent the Three Virtues, love, sincerity and filial piety. Commonly known as loyalty filial piety and righteousness. That's all good, but why do the tiles need to be so big? You... Such a big tile... Carving such a big tile... Right. That's good. As time went on, mahjong kept evolving. And finally settled with the 108-tile version, representing the 108 warriors of the Water Margin Legend. With the addition of various flower tiles, the whole set has 144 tiles. This is a flower. It's the bird. Centipede. It's alive, and it wants to bite me. Every player has 13 tiles to represent 13 weeks of a season. There are 52 weeks in the four seasons totaling 364 days. The winning tile represents the final day of a year. To make it 365 days, one complete year. Master, is there an ace tile to every suit? Of course, Little Monkey. Mah...mahjong. Pay...pay up. Playing mahjong is commonly referred to by the Chinese as playing eight rounds or "dry swimming". A square table is used for playing mahjong, which represents North, South, East, West. As well as spring, summer, autumn and winter. -Four Bamboos. -I'll take it. One tile discarded and three players win. Mahjong has been passed down for generations. Becoming a form of entertainment in people's lives. Even the aunties enjoy a game of mahjong. Mahjong became a form of entertainment and also a sport. It can foster relationships... Prevent Alzheimer's... Hurry up... Finally I'm here. Come on. Eleven. Two Bamboos. Four Bamboos. I'll take it. One tile discarded and three players win. -Where are you going? -Toilet. -No way. -You're wriggling out of this? We've waited for a year for you to walk to this table. You might take another two years to walk to the loo. Pay up before you go. Now it's becoming more convenient to play mahjong. It's even available online. We can play mahjong anytime, anywhere. See, they are so well versed in history. You call this history? Don't be a bad example to the kids. Everyone learns their history from the TV these days. Nobody takes it seriously. At least their knowledge of history has improved. Since picking up mahjong they've scored full marks in history. What's the matter? Not willing to admit defeat? Let's have a bet then. Sure...bring it on. Alright, same rules. If I win, you can't stop them from coming to play with me. And, you have to stop bothering me for a week. -And what if I win... -Okay. Dinner, movies, whatever you want. Everyone has nine tiles from One Character to Nine Character. The first to complete the suit will win. Let's go. I'm done. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, correct. Three, seven, nine, eight, four, one, five, six, two, wrong. Sassy won. Mr. Yang lost. Sir... What a pity. Don't worry sir, you'll get used to losing. It's not your first time losing to Sassy anyway. Come, let's continue playing. Let's carry on, he has to go back to teaching. What's the matter? Are you okay? I'm fine, it's just that you eat with such elegance. As your father, I feel content. That's great. -What do you think if... -All right. -Actually... -I get it. -She... -I said cut it. You want me to be like her. Talk softer, be more gentle like a lady, right? What's so terrible about me now? You are perfect as you are. -But if you could... -Dad. There are no ifs and buts in this world. I just want you to have a boyfriend. In case, one day, I'm not here anymore. Not here? Where are you going? Back to meet the one who made me. Why would you meet God all of a sudden? Not all of a sudden. History tells us, people die. No, anyone can die except you. You can't leave me alone. Okay, I won't die then. That's more like it. But even if I don't die, you still need to date. I think that Wayne Yang is not bad. You got to be kidding, Dad. Him? Not bad? He's old-fashioned and dumb. He stutters and he can't even play mahjong. Every time I play with him, he loses. What's so good about him? All that can change. Old-fashioned means he's honest. A slow talker is better than a smooth talker. As for playing mahjong, it's easy to learn. What are you doing? Hey... Hey... Are you guys serious? Yep, it's here. Who's making noise here? We're looking for Pak Chong Fatt, where is he? What Pak Chong Fatt? Hong Chong Fatt? There's only Chow Yun Fat. -Bugger off. -Wong Tin Ba! Wong Tin Ba! Who's that guy? He's the World Mahjong Champion for ten consecutive years. The modern day King of Mahjong, Wong Tin Ba. He's got style. What's wrong with the plastic bags today? The dace also aren't fresh enough. Sassy, where did you get those plastic bags? Where did you get those dace? Hey there handsome, how many seats do you need? It's been a while, Pak Chong Fatt. What? Pak Chong Fatt. Born on the 9th of October, 1970. Libra, blood type O. His passion is to help those in need. Cut the crap. Tell me what's their relationship. He was taught by the same master as Wong Tin Ba. Rumor has it that after they turned on each other, Pak Chong Fatt vanished from the world of mahjong. Brother Fatt is Pak Chong Fatt? Are you sure you got the right person? What do you think? I never thought you could find me here. How's it going, my little brother? It's been so long. Is this invitation for your birthday party or your daughter's wedding? It's to challenge you to a duel. The next mahjong championship is coming up. I must have a duel with you this time. It's been a while since I've played, you should stop playing too. I'll ask you again, are you up for a duel or not? -No, thanks. -Come on. -Nah. -Come on. -No, thanks. -Come on. -Nope. -For god's sake quit dilly-dallying. Happiness can't be forced. Sometimes you need to take a gamble for your happiness. You have no choice because I have chosen you. I must gamble with you this time. Roasted chicken drumstick. Such a pity to become a mute at such a young age. Alright, let's eat now. -My child... -I'm not your daughter. I'm not your daughter and you're not my father. How did you find out? Are you for real? I was just joking. What are you saying? I thought you were mute turns out you're a retard. You are as short as I am. Could you possibly be the daughter of our neighbor, Tall Wai? Doesn't matter, from now on, you eat yours, I eat mine and we stay out of each other's way. Why? We're family. Have you ever considered me family? -You seem angry. -You bet I am. My father was the King of Mahjong, Pak Chong Fatt. And I only know of it now, and you say we're family? You've kept a lot of things from me as well. Like what, tell me? When you sat for your exam, you watched romance and action videos instead of studying, and I didn't say anything. All right, stop. It's not that I don't want to tell you, but you never asked. Why would I talk about these things out of the blue? Okay, let me ask you now. Why sell Yong tau foo when you can be the King of Mahjong? Let's eat first before I tell you. Stop pretending or I'll chase you. Once upon a time... Speak Mandarin, sit down. I thought for such an important event English would be more apt. English? Your English sounds like Tamil. Don't try too hard. We'll have to start 20 years ago. Hurry up. Twenty-five years ago... Zhang Shun You, the Wong Tin Ba of today, and I learnt mahjong together from our Master Ru from a very young age. Five. Mine. Yours. Mine. Yours. Mine. Yours. Skip. Next. Reveal. The Thirteen Wonders. Your hand decides the moment the tiles are stacked. If you're not the dealer, try to put your tiles over here. Look, they're all Bamboos. Told you... Master always said you don't win by gambling. Winning or losing is just an illusion, lose your money but never your life. Only the good-hearted wins. He also said, I often win because I don't harp on winning or losing. Is it really that important winning or losing when playing mahjong? You win this round you could well lose the next. What's the big deal? Green Dragon, Four Large Blessings. You need a single Eight Bamboo you have a full suite of Bamboos. You lack a tile of Green Dragon. How should I play this Green Dragon tile? Fatt, You... I think it's time. So early? Didn't we just have our lunch? All you think about is eating. I meant it's time you two have a duel. The winner will succeed me as the King of Mahjong. What happens to the loser then? He will become the apprentice of the King of Mahjong. Might as well be the sidekick. I didn't say anything. All right, best of three rounds. Begin... MASTER OF MAHJONG Five Circles. Game. -The Three Great Scholars. -Wow, you're good. Wow, the Three Great Scholars. Thanks for the recognition. All right. Self-Draw. West Wind. Chicken Hand. Damn you. Why would you even win on a Chicken Hand? You like chicken that much. Do you even know how to play mahjong? Green Dragon. Game. The Thirteen Wonders. Master, I've won two of the three rounds. I'm your successor, now teach me the legendary mahjong Kung fu. I'll announce who's the winner. Of course. The winner is... Ah Fatt. But why? That's the Thirteen Wonders right there. I didn't say the one who wins will succeed me. You're right. I knew it. No matter how I fare you'll always see me as the loser. -You, listen to me. -Say no more. I've listened to you long enough. You talk all day long. I've had enough of it. I'm not listening to you anymore. I'm not your disciple anymore. Brother... So that was how Wong Tin Ba left our master. And went on to challenge everyone everywhere. From India to Egypt. From Egypt to Japan. From Japan to China. Challenging the Kings of Mahjong of every region. Ninety Thousand. Red Middle. Children. Two Circles. Big Four Happiness. Game. Sensei... Get rid of the tiles that you don't need no point keeping them. Self-Draw. Why are you discarding your self-drawn winning tile... Mahjong? Hold on, hold on. The Three Great Scholars. -After you. -See you. Finally, Wong Tin Ba got what he wished for. He defeated all the best mahjong players in the world. And even won the title of King of Mahjong for ten consecutive years. But one thing I can't wrap my head around. You gave up the Green Dragon tile for Wong Tin Ba, so by right he should've won. Why did your master announce you as the winner? Later, Master explained it to me. I've lost, why did you say I won, master? Do you think I'm a renovation contractor? I can see. He won in the game of mahjong. But lost due to his character. My successor must have good character. Winning without character is meaningless. It's been days since I heard from you, where have you been? Everywhere. I've been to wherever I won't see a poker face a black face and two stupid faces. You two look like you have a lot of free time. Why don't you go accompany the boss? Spend some time with your dad. Don't keep avoiding him. I'll just be another black face. Doesn't make a difference. You find that funny? Don't you? Yes. It's really hilarious. Why did you hit me? Hit me? You... How dare you lay your finger on the great Wong Tin Ba? Game, 108 Warriors of... What are you doing? There are mosquitos. I have such a big house. This mosquito is actually my brother. He talks to me through his buzzing. Now that you killed it who's going to talk to me? You don't talk to me. And I don't want to talk to these two. You three jump into the water. Where did DeeYi Zhang go again? ...right? There you are. Baby, who's this? Who are you? He should know who I am. Pure Honor Hand. Four Large Blessings, Full Blossoms. -That's 88 folds, everybody. -What a big win? It's nothing. What are you doing? Where did the extra tiles come from? Hey, are you trying to cheat? Cheating? Are you kidding me? It's written here "No cheating". Do you think I'm blind? Do you think I'm stupid? Stop mucking about, do you know what you're talking about? They say bringing mahjong tiles around this year brings good luck. And you thought I'm cheating... What took him so long? -Do you know what time it is now? -Must've come from here. What's with the crowd? Did Michelle Yeoh turn up? All the neighbors want you to be their master. I'm number 15 in line. You people are crazy. -When did I say I'm accepting students? -You're Pak Chong Fatt. The first ever King of Mahjong, of course we'd like to learn from you. If you're here for the Tofu, I'm more than happy. But if you're here to learn mahjong, please leave. Master, I've been having a bad hand in mahjong. Any tips? That's your fate. Don't ask me, how would I know? Why are two of you holding me down instead of standing in line? I listen better and learn more this way. My reason is simple, I just want to touch you. Do it on me first. -You're such a pain. -Come on, teach me a few tricks. Which one of you is Pak Chong Fatt? I am, what's the matter? -Who? -Surely not me. It's him. You two idiots. It's me. Miss, may I know what you're doing here? I suppose you don't remember the King of Gai Hu? The one who I defeated in the inaugural championship? That's right, he's my father. So you're his daughter. Come and give Uncle Fatt a hug. Go on. That year, he made it to the finals against all odds. But you beat him hands down. Since then he's become like this. Never to smile again. All right, since you're here, I'll let you have vengeance. You two, go distract her. Actually, we... Let's have a duel. -Hey, you. -You're up. I already said I've forgotten how to play mahjong. If you don't play, you'll get it from us. Come on, if not now then when? If you don't play we'll annoy the hell out of you. -I'll pester you. -Won't leave you alone. Come on, play with her. All right then. Let's do this. -Four Circles. -Pong. East Wind. One Circle. Pong. One Circle, here's a Four Circles tile. Lucky you, getting the final tile. South Wind. Want to make a Pure Hand of Circle? Watch me spoil it. Eight Circles. Pong. Nine Circles. Pong, here's a Seven Circles. Pong. Seven Circles. Nine Pieces Penalty, it's on you if he wins. I'm sorry, Hidden Six Circles Kong. Self-Draw win on Replacement Tile. I must win to make my father smile again. Five Circles. Get a Self-Draw win, come on. Kong. Eight Circles. Two Character. I'll take that Two Character. I'll discard a One Character. Game. What? You're waiting for a single tile of One Character, snatch her game. That's none of your business. Are you playing or am I playing? They came so far for revenge, winning on a Chicken Hand doesn't make sense. Chicken Hand, are you for real? That's a bit too lame, don't you think? It's called a Chicken Hand, of course it's lame. I've waited 20 years for this. I finally got my revenge. To be able to play with a mahjong expert like Pak Chong Fatt. Look, your father is smiling again. You shouldn't have waited so long for that. If you had understood this 20 years ago, you wouldn't have been upset for so long. Playing mahjong is just a form of entertainment. When it's done, get on with it. That's a load of bull. Remember what I taught you? What should be done after you've lost? What do you want? Good manners. Thank you. Don't even think of kissing me, I'll hit you. Ramona. It really is you. Sir, have you seen my husband? What's the matter with you? Don't you recognize me? I'm your husband, Fatt. It can't be. My husband is very handsome. He's tall and macho. And he's very good at mahjong. Look. Take a good look at yourself. Not the breast, the tattoo. It's the same, look. This type of tattoo is so common. My husband is so handsome, so macho. But you're short and stout and you look so shifty. And you stink. How could you be my husband? There are so many people here, can you cut me some slack? -But you're not my husband. -I really am your husband. You're not. -I am. I am. -You're not. You're not. You leave me with no choice but to share this with everyone. Your body anatomy is very weird. If I touch you here, you'll scream. If I touch you here, you'll get excited. If I touch your head, you'll be obedient. Am I right? Shut up. How come you know so much about me? Because I'm your husband. -Fatt? -Yes. Come on. Where is this place? This is not a common place, it's Brother Fatt's house. -Isn't that my house? -Yes. Nan Yang. Don't I come from a rich family? Come, sit down. I'll get you a drink. Sassy, we have a guest. Look who's here. Who's so important? See for yourself. Hey, is this your wife? His wife? She left a long time ago. Why is your wife so bad? That's not all, she's materialistic and greedy. -Ridiculous, shameless... -Sassy. How can you insult your mother when she's right in front of you? At least turn around. This is your mother. -My mother? -My daughter? That is correct. Your mother's daughter is you...right that makes her your mother! Why did you bring her home? Don't tell me we need to seek your permission first. This is my home, not yours. Hey, you said this is my home, isn't it? Ah Fatt's home? Your home has been broken since you left us when I was two years old. Stop arguing. Yes. I know this is a bit too sudden for you. It's the same for me. I saw her alone today, looking for her husband on the streets. Isn't she looking for me? But she couldn't recognize me even though I'm so handsome. The only thing she recognizes is money anyway. Don't be fooled by her. I'm not that stupid. I took her to the doctor and the doctor said, apparently, a year after she left us, she lost her memory after an accident. Lost her memory? Is this some sort of lame soap opera plot? Soap operas are indeed lame. But she really is your mother. It hasn't been easy for her being alone all these years. You'll understand these matters of the heart when you grow up. You can see for yourself. Who in their right mind eats mahjong tiles? What? I'm hungry. You're not supposed to eat mahjong tiles. I'll cook for you if you are hungry. Let's go outside. Loss of memory? Mom... Let me teach you how to play mahjong today. Mahjong? Is it fun? It's okay if you don't know. Within a few days, and a few losses, you'll get the hang of it. Come on. I've got no money. If I lose I only have my daughter to offer you. Let's restart the game since she just sat down. -Sure. -Let's go. Eight Circles. Nine Character. Can I win now? You don't have enough folds. Just follow whatever the others are doing. Discard that Nine Character tile. Three Character. Can I win now? How is it possible that you can still win? Self-Draw, game. The Thirteen Wonders. You scared the daylight out of me. I can't see through this mess. Eight-and-a-half Pairs. Pure Hand. Is that a big win? I win. Pay up. Five Bamboos. Self-Draw. Nine Gates Hand. Pay up, please. Are you sure you are crazy? It really doesn't seem like it. Thank you. When are we going to play again? Come earlier tomorrow and you can play with yourself. Who's going to play with you again? First time and we've already lost so much. Do you know how many people I'll have to massage to earn this much? I lost my grocery money again. Girl, they are such sore losers. Ignore them, we're rich. What are you doing? Sewing on some buttons. I saw the buttons on your father's clothes, they don't match. Every single one of them. If you really cared for him you wouldn't have left. I was wrong. I thought I could live a good life having married the King of Mahjong. But he suddenly quit. I got angry, so I left in a fit of anger. I never thought it'd be so hard to turn back. I know you both are still mad at me. I've got nothing to say. If you really don't want to see me, I can leave any time. I'm really leaving. Take care of your father, I'm leaving. You come and go as you please, you think this is a hotel? I've taken care of your husband all these years. It's your turn now. One more thing. Don't be fooled by his carefree outlook. He's never forgotten you. Take good care of him. It's so hot. I want to be a responsible husband. What Kung fu is he practicing? Could it be the legendary mahjong Kung fu? So you've invited yourself. Drinking alcohol in broad day light. Sassy doesn't care about me anymore. What makes you say that? She's been ignoring me... I think it's time to let her go. She only cares for her mom right now. What about my life? I'm hopeless. So that's what you think? You're too pessimistic. I know my daughter. Her anger comes and goes. It doesn't matter if she's angry with me. The point is I don't have a place in her heart. I'm not important to her. If that's the case, then why would she have wagers with you? Because she wants to defeat me. She wants me to back off. That silly girl. Every time she plays mahjong with you she looks at you in a different way. Doesn't that prove that she likes you? Remember, to be a good man, one must not be greedy. And one must not be impatient. Even if you have the lousiest hand, don't be afraid. Sometimes, to lose is to win. Get it? To lose is to win. I get it. Thank you. I understand now. Thank you. Sassy, here I come. Most handsome guys in this world are dumb. Sassy is having a duel with Mr. Yang again. Ready? Go. So fast? Reveal what you have. Sir, don't you know one, two, three? What are you doing? Are you trying to be funny? Sorry. Give me one last chance. One last chance, let's do this again. Every time she plays mahjong with you she looks at you in a different way. Wow, Sassy wins again. But Mr. Yang completed his hand first. So what? I'm pretty sure it's a mess again. Reveal. Wow, Mr. Yang. You're good, you've won. Very good, you've defeated me Don't look for me anymore. Sassy. Sassy. What do you want? You earlier said, if I want to date you, I'll have to defeat you first. So can I ask you out on a date now? Fine. But I'm telling you I have no feelings for you. Then why is it that whenever I play mahjong with you, you gaze at me so gently? Rubbish. Fatt told me. As long as you're the apple of my eye and vice versa, winning or losing isn't important at all. I... Let's be together. Apparently, when you fall for someone, you'll feel happy even when he defeats you. That's life. But hey what's wrong with that? From the moment you fell for him you've already lost. Dad... You're such an expert in love. So why did you break up with mom? Because of love. We went separate ways. Your mom and I grew up together. She was the girl that everyone coveted. Smart and pretty. Good at mahjong too. She was known as... The Queen of Thirteen Wonders. Look at her smile. Makes my heart skip a beat. We got married later on. I won the World Mahjong Championship that year. And became the King of Mahjong. Are you sure? I really can't take it anymore. -Ramona and I were soulmates. -Is that necessary? Since when we used to date we enjoyed playing mahjong together. Such a lovely couple. Hubby... She was the only person who could defeat me at the mahjong table. This Green Dragon tile is annoying me, watch me discard it. Four Large Blessings, pay up. You knew she wanted the Green Dragon, yet you discarded it. Men. Hubby, quick, pay up. What's going on. -What's going on? -She's giving birth, give me that? Ramona gave birth soon after. That was the happiest time of our lives. Six Circles. Sassy. Two Circles. But good times never last. Before the second World Mahjong Championships, I was very stressed. I was terrified of losing my status as the world champion. At that moment, I realized playing mahjong no longer means the same anymore. I started having second thoughts. Hubby, I've cooked some ginseng chicken. To help you become the King of Mahjong for the second time. I'm a little reluctant to go. Why? I feel like... Playing mahjong for the sake of competition seems to be deviating from its original intent. As long as you win every time. What other purpose do you need? That's not what the master taught me. I'm warning you. I'm investing my youth in you I saw a bright future in you. I won't allow you to give up. Ramona, don't go. What's going to happen to me and Sassy if you leave? My husband, the King of Mahjong is now a useless man. Why should I stay? What will it take to make you stay? Play a round with me. If you win you can give the competition a miss. If I win, you have to win the World Mahjong Championship. You can't force me like this. You're the one forcing me to do this. I could've become the Queen of Mahjong. I gave up everything to marry you, the King of Mahjong. Now you're telling me to give up my dream. Let's play a round then. White Dragon. Kong. Four Character. Red Dragon. Kong. Eight Circles. Green Dragon. Kong. Seven Bamboos. I used to let her win all the time. But this time... Ramona. Chicken Hand. I'm not that important to you after all. Little did she know that I let her go on purpose. Although I didn't want to compete anymore. But she was still so young She should pursue her dreams. I didn't want to hold her back. Your wife was heartless didn't it hurt you? That's how youngsters are, they want glamour. Who doesn't want to be the Queen of Mahjong? Do you still love your wife then? Of course. Every second of my life. So handsome, let's put that on Facebook. Boss... Handsome should be one word, not two. I did it on purpose. If not, you wouldn't have come in. Boss... People are slamming you on Facebook. What are they saying? They say "handsome" should be one word. Take that picture down immediately. Then upload other stuff to distract them. Avoid bad publicity before the World Mahjong Championships. Okay. How do I spell "surprise"? Just write it in Chinese. Good idea. Surprise. Boss, you're so wise, what's the surprise? The first ever King of Mahjong versus the winner of ten consecutive years. Surprising enough? Oh Boss, so you're the first ever King of Mahjong. Only now do I know that Pak Chong Fatt won it for ten consecutive years. I've fed and clothed you two, yet you don't even know who's who. Look at those trophies behind. I use them to store my sauces, can't you see? What plans do you have? Everything is going according to plan. I smell Yong tau foo, this should be the house. I'll take it. The Thirteen Wonders. Crazy. Can't you walk properly? Boss, you already came in this with a bell in hand. Surely I have to pretend to be possessed to complement you? Don't talk crap. You've been here for so long why haven't you reported to me? Have you found out what Kung fu Pak Chong Fatt has been practicing? Yes, I found out that he doesn't even touch mahjong. That's great, I finally have reason to sell you to Ethiopia. Just great. They suffer from famine and poverty they won't be able to "use" me. They can't use you, but they can eat you. Your skin is slightly wrinkled but your flesh is still quite tender. -Please, don't. -Should be worth a dime or two. I did find out a secret of his. What secret? Out with it. He practices a kind of Kung fu everyday. Palms joined with eyes focused. Tongue and limbs stretched out. Rein in the temples and diaphragm. Take in the energy of the universe to nourish the brain. So, this is Master's Legendary Mahjong Kung fu. Who's peeping? I get it now. If Pak Chong Fatt can master it, so can I. Let's see who's the real King of Mahjong is. Your mission now is to persuade him to take part in the championships. Only then will your mission be complete. Let's see how you resist me. Hubby... Let's eat first. Hubby. I have something...to tell you. What do you want? I want to say... We're back. Dad, mom. Fill the bowl. Have they gotten married? Last I checked, they weren't married yet. I really have something to tell you. So much food today? Is there some offering to the gods? No, we haven't had a sumptuous meal since your mum came back. Thanks to you, mom. Come, let's dig in. Mom Dad, let's dig in. What did you want to say just now? Nothing. I feel like we're a family. What's wrong with you? We really are a family, okay. By the way, when did you marry my daughter, may I ask? Last night. You married my daughter in my room? So handsome. Hubby... Am I interrupting your Kung fu practice? Are you sure this is related to...mahjong? Here it comes. I can feel it. Since you left, I... You haven't done "it" for 20 years? I've practiced the Legendary Mahjong Kung fu for quite some time now. You guys are practicing mahjong with me today. I was afraid, after not using it for so long, it will... That's why I... Are you waiting for the Six and Nine Character tiles? You need a single Three Character tile. You want the Six and Nine Circles tiles right? How do you know? You won't feel much in the beginning. But after 49 practice sessions, your carnal desire will explode from within. What does it feel like? It feels like someone opened the zoo gates and all the elephants are charging out. Boss, don't... Boss, I'm warning you I'm very experienced. Once you start, I won't stop. What are you doing? -Hey. -You old and cheap woman. Why don't you dig a hole and bury yourself in it? Don't let me see you again. Sorry, boss. I was about to call you. The Kung fu that Ah Fatt has been practicing isn't for mahjong. -It's for his little brother, right? -Yes. You might as well tell me after my "little brother" is injured from overexertion? If you can't make Pak Chong Fatt take part in the championships, I'll sell you to Ethiopia. As for the gambling debts you owe me. I'll cut your fingers off one by one. That's all. Wong Tin Ba, I shall remind you again. Don't say I'm long-winded. Your 10-year good fortune is coming to an end. If you want good fortune for another ten years, you must defeat Pak Chong Fatt at the championships this year. You're not just long-winded you're ridiculously long-winded. Can you turn on the heater now? Don't tell me these vicious-looking people are here for my Yong tau foo so early? -Hubby... -Darling! It wasn't easy getting mum back, and now she's taken away from us again. I must look for my mum. If it's a kidnap why haven't we received any calls yet? -Help. -Ramona? You recognize your wife's voice, right? What do you want? Very simple, if I see you as one of the players in the World Mahjong Championship, you'll see her. If I don't see you then, you won't see her for the rest of your life. Help! -So? -Yeah, what now? Brother Fatt is finally going back to the mahjong table. Let's welcome back Brother Fatt. I'm very proud to be able to practice and play with you. I don't know why I'm very anxious suddenly. Why? Fatt we're here to practice with you. According to the module I've designed, the first session should be... Drawing tiles. Everybody draw your own tiles please. Draw the Thirteen Wonders in the shortest time possible. You can't look at the tiles while drawing. -Is this the correct way? -You're good. Next, let's practice how to tabulate points. Tell me the points the moment I reveal my hand. These are the initial tiles of a dealer. That's Four Small Blessings, totals 13 points. No, it's also a Mixed Pure Hand you've got to add three points. So the total should be 16 points. -That's a lot of "fun". -No. If it's a dealers initial hand, it's a Heavenly Hand. A Heavenly, Mixed Pure Hand with Four Small Blessings is 29 points. What about this one? Four Large Blessings 13 points, Mixed Pure Hand 3 points. Triplets Hand three points, including the flowers is a total of 20 points. Excellent. How many points are in this one? Hold on, give us some time. This hand is neither here nor there. Obviously it's a Chicken Hand. Genius. -You're a gambling genius. -My idol. Don't be so cliché we're learning from one another. I don't think you need to practice the basics anymore. Why don't we go straight into competition? Sure. I'm so nervous. Hold it. I've never been this nervous playing mahjong in the past decade. I'm a little apprehensive about playing against my master today. -Dad... -Brother Fatt... What's the matter with you? -Dad... -How are you feeling? -Lie down. -Thanks. It's no big deal. But I think I can't go to the competition. Why? You were killing it in the beginning. What happened? I wanted to win. This is what happens when you're too eager to win. That's why I pulled out of the second world championships. I don't play to win. With this mentality how am I to defeat Wong Tin Ba? Let's begin the day. Where are you going so early? Sassy. Ah Fatt. Letter for you from Sassy. I'm eloping with Wayne Yang. Don't worry, it's just for a few days. We'll be home once we've had enough fun. So this is Sassy's final move. Ah Fatt, you've raised a daughter with such fine character. Ah Fatt. I knew you'd come back to find me. I know you all too well. Since the day I announced you as the winner, I knew he'd never let it go. But I'm travelling the world now. You need to settle your own problems. A word of advice before I leave. You don't have much weaknesses. Except you think too much. If you weren't like that, Ramona probably wouldn't have left. Your life would've been complete. Do you remember? I told you the true spirit of playing mahjong. The tiles don't determine winning or losing. The player does. The tiles are lifeless but the player isn't. Playing mahjong is like learning how to be a good person. If you get too caught up in winning or losing, even if you have the best hand it'll all be in vain. -One Circle. -Game. The Three Great Scholars Triplets, Mixed Pure Hand. Green Dragon. -You're so smart. -Game. You're not affected by the outcome anymore. How can you ever be defeated? It's only after 20 years that I began to understand this saying. Am I slow? Luckily it's still in time. TO MY DISCIPLE WONG TIN BA TO MY DISCIPLE PAK CHONG FATT THE 12TH KING OF MAHJONG WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP You really want to do this yourself? I have my dad's genes surely I won't come in last. And the most important thing is I can take the opportunity to look for my mom. Miss DeeYi Zhang. Welcome to the King of Mahjong Championships. -It's her? -You know each other? I've seen her before. We meet again, isn't that fate? So that's your type. What type? What do you mean by that? Why would you know someone like that? That night in bed you said you would love me forever. Since it's none of your business are you still trying to be a hero? I'll whoop your ass, Miss Third Party. Miss, don't be too sad. Sad? I'm more than thrilled to see them fall apart. That's how she ruined a couple the other day. Just because she couldn't stand them. I'm the type that he likes, and he's been devoted to me all these years. What? Are you jealous? Why are you talking to these people in public? DeeYi Zhang. Who are you? And who are they? Aren't you afraid of diminishing your own status? Why? Where did your arrogance go? Initially there was just Wong Tin Ba. Now there's another DeeYi Zhang, how are we going to win? Are you nuts? Why are you putting your own team down? Dad, what are you doing? I want to come and play mahjong here. Why are you dressed like that here? I'm a man, how can I let my daughter battle this alone? -Brother Fatt, you really are my idol. -Of course. -I thought you had no confidence? -Initially I didn't. Now I do, or how else do we save your mum? Dad... It's good that you're confident. But, the way you're dressed... -I think it looks good. -No way. The first ever King of Mahjong must look the part. We still have time. -Let's go. -Where to? Not only do I want to win this competition. I want the two of you to make the finals no matter what it takes. I want Pak Chong Fatt to be disgraced in the mahjong world. I want him to hit rock bottom. Yes. Do you understand? Yes. I've waited for this for 20 years. I'll finally have my vengeance. THE 12TH KING OF MAHJONG WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP Hello, everyone. Welcome to the 12th King of Mahjong World Championship. -I'm your emcee, Mushroom. -I'm Sea Cucumber. Not only do we have the best of the best players this year, we also have a huge surprise for everyone today. We have invited an incredibly unexpected special guest. The first ever King of Mahjong, Pak Chong Fatt. Mr. Pak Chong Fatt you're the first ever King of Mahjong. Is Wong Tin Ba the reason you came out of retirement? Is it because no one's been able to defeat him in the past ten years? And you think you can? Are you confident of beating him? To be honest, in terms of playing mahjong, can you not throw it anymore? It looks cool, master. I know, but it hurts. Thank you. Mahjong is a form of entertainment. If you play to win, it loses its meaning. Ah Fatt, we're here to support you and Sassy. -Give it your best shot. -You can do it. Thank you. Where's Ah Lian? She's busy doing plastic surgery. Do you think I need plastic surgery as well? Absolutely. Let's play mahjong first. Will the inaugural King of Mahjong pit against the King of Mahjong of ten consecutive years? Today's competition is more exciting than ever before. Relax, just relax. Okay. This is so hot, what should I do? -Just a little while more. -I can't take it anymore. -Give it your best shot, Ah Fatt. -We're right behind you. Thanks. I didn't want to wear this coat, it was my daughter's idea. -Understood. -Good. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the champion for ten years in a row Wong Tin Ba, and his daughter, DeeYi Zhang. As well as his disciple, Icy. Mr. Wong Tin Ba are you confident of keeping the title? Are you confident of defeating Pak Chong Fatt? Don't go, we still have questions for you. Do you think you look good in that garbage bag? Hello. That's him, don't take him seriously. As always, in the preliminary round the first contestants to score 20 points will have their bulbs lit up, each bulb represents two points. They will then proceed to the next round. This process shall be repeated until we reach the semi-finals. If no one manages to get all their bulbs lit, the highest scorer will proceed to the next round. Three winners from the semi-finals will get to challenge our 10-year champion for the title. Let's kick off this year's King of Mahjong World Championship. EAST Heavenly Hand. Are you kidding me? First to qualify for the semi-finals is Ms. Icy. Game, Earthly Hand. Second contestant to advance to the semi-finals, the daughter of Wong Tin Ba, DeeYi Zhang. Congratulations. Will the father and daughter be challenging each other for the title? Let's keep our eyes peeled. Four Large Blessings, concealed. Mixed Pure Hand, All Terminal. Three Hidden Treasure. Pak Chong Fatt's daughter also made it into the semi-finals. -Congratulations, Ms. Sassy Bai. -Sassy won. Come have a seat, Sassy. You were great. WEST NORTH It's already the final round. Do you think Brother Fatt will get full lights? That doesn't matter. What's important is to win. North Wind. Pong. Discarding a character tile to lure my North Wind. Trying to draw a snake out of its hole. I can see through that. North Wind. Win. What a fine round. What a move by Pak Chong Fatt. Making the semi-finals with the highest score. He won by a hair's breadth. Fatt, you were awesome. You're so good. It wasn't a landslide win but you have such good skills. And what a character, I am deeply humbled. It's just a game. It's just a game. Pak Chong Fatt. You purposely discarded a tile for the player with the lowest score. Good. A hypocrite, but I like you. THE 12TH KING OF MAHJONG WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP After the preliminary qualifying matches, the semi-finals will now begin. -East Wind. -I'll take that. -Chicken Hand. -That's right. Five Bamboos. Take the in-betweens. Chicken Hand again. -East Wind. -I'll take that. East Wind two points. Can he win like that? It's a race between the hare and the turtle. This move is called "stuffing yourself up". A few small wins make for a big win, you didn't get it. -One Bamboo. -I'll take that. Chicken Hand. Mahjong, Self-Draw, three points, sorry. As expected. See, I was right, the turtle won. Mr. Pak Chong Fatt is the first to make it to the final. Congratulations! Next, we shall witness the battle of the century. You can do it. Look. She's got so many flower tiles. If she wins this round it's a lot of points. If she makes it into the finals, she will be playing against Brother Fatt for Wong Tin Ba. I'll jinx that...jinx... Self-Draw win, Pure Honor Hand. Three Great Scholars. We jinxed the wrong one. How many points is that? A lot, for sure. Our second finalist is Ms. Icy. Congratulations. Who will be the final player in the finals? So nerve-wracking. But if you look at Sassy Bai's and DeeYi Zhang's table, this is an inverse duel between their fathers. Brother Fatt. Fatt... Go. Oh, what a klutz, DeeYi Zhang. She accidentally revealed a tile and is now at a disadvantage. Luckily it's just a Formed Meld. Two Circles, Open Kong. Robbing the Kong, win. That's a Trick Hand. You were waiting for the Two Circles, Five Circles and Eight Circles tiles. You passed up that Eight Circles just now and you didn't draw. How can you take the Two Circles now? Right, according to the rules she can't take this tile. But she's already revealed her hand so it's considered a Trick Hand. -That's right. -We are at the last round, and it's a tie between DeeYi Zhang and Sassy Bai. DeeYi's Trick Hand causes her loss to Sassy by a hair's breadth. Sassy. That's right, she won, that's my daughter. Don't you remember what I've taught you? Do you have polio? You can't even hold on to an Eight Circles tile. This is a mistake only an idiot will make. It's my mistake, but I didn't mean it. It's not whether you meant it or not. It's about how I'm going to face the public from now on. You're my daughter, DeeYi Zhang. I don't want you to be number one in anything else. I only want you to be number one in mahjong. Since I'm such an embarrassment to you, I'll leave. You're leaving... Who's gonna take photo with me later when I win? You'd ruin my perfect father image. If she really leaves, cancel all her credit cards for me. The most exciting match and the best of the best is unfolding right before us. The finals of this year's King of Mahjong Championship starts now. What's the matter? -Are you nervous? -A little. Are you worried that you won't draw a good hand? Sometimes I can't get good ingredients from the market, but I still have to cook. You can do it if you put your heart into it. Chicken Hand is also considered a win. Don't be afraid of losing, just do it. Brother... Don't call me that. From now on, you'll have to call me the King of Mahjong for 11 consecutive years. Did you eat a lot of garlic? Your mouth stinks. He does have a better chance. Cut the crap. -I'll finish you off in one round. -Of course. Let's see what you guys have in hand. Red Dragon. Pong. Let's move in for the kill then. Red Dragon. -Green Dragon. -Pong. I'll just follow your lead, Green Dragon. Why did you do that? I told you before, learn how to be a good person before learning mahjong. People might think you're talking about them. This is your elder, show some respect. That's right you need to respect your elders. Stop chiding your daughter. She's just following the bad example you set. It's genes. You already have both Green and Red Dragons. Are you going to get the White Dragon too? That would be such a coincidence. Pong. Why are you so careless? That's a Three Great Scholars you just gave away. And you asked me to show him respect? How would I know he has all three dragons? And you know how much I hate those tiles. Nine Bamboos. Nine Bamboos. Nothing from you? Watch me. East Wind. Pong. East Wind. I have to be smart about this. I have to let dad Pong. -One Circle. -Pong. South Wind. Pong. South Wind. -Two Circles. -Pong. West Wind. Pong. West Wind. You'll have to cover all losses if you were to gift her a Four Large Blessings. Three Circles. Even the blind could tell you can't discard a North Wind tile now. Icy, prepare to Pong. How would you know? I'm the King of Mahjong. I'll shout it out for you. Pong. Two Character. She only needs another tile to win. I can't discard the North Wind. -Three Bamboos. -I'll take that. How? It should be hers, not yours. Don't you know the rules? Take it, even though it's nothing much. Four Small Blessings. Sassy. She is Winning with a Four Small Blessings hand. She's devouring "herself". Are you playing or is she playing? If you're playing for real she should be on her own. If you were to team up and bully her. Why don't you two share a hand? Boss can't defeat them with a single blow. That's a first in ten years. Pak Chong Fatt is really something. What the... I'm letting you win this round since you're not so bright. Let's break for 15 minutes and resume later. Don't take it to heart, that's how he is. There will be a 15-minute interval, see you later. See you later. I realized that you're rather fidgety today. You'll raise your chest when you hold big tiles, that's not good. Be more mindful of it. Daughter of Wong Tin Ba. Come with me, I have something to show you. Your father said okay. What kind of wife did he marry, for him to have such a tanned and skinny daughter? Pak Chong Fatt is here for the championship. I have completed my mission, where's my money? I want it now. So little? I've settled your gambling debts. Food and accommodation at my house cost money too. -What a cheapskate. -Beat it. You couldn't discard the North Wind tile, that's right. You couldn't discard any Bamboo tiles as well, yet you did. So everything was a lie. It's not too late to realize that. You came back to find us because he paid you to do it. That's right. I've succeeded in getting him back into compete after all these years. Of course, I'm happy. Are you? Of course, who wouldn't be with all this money? What's the matter? Are you questioning me? Dad, Mom's leaving, won't you make her stay? Can I? Remember to take care of yourself. Don't open your eyes so big when you're lying. Don't act cool when you're cheating that will give you away. Aren't you mad at me? Really? I just want you to be happy. You knew she was lying all along? Why didn't you say anything? Because you would leave again if I did. Wait. All right, that's enough. Look, Brother Fatt is not only God of Mahjong, he's also a Casanova. We're not young anymore. We're here for the competition cut the drama, will you? Mind your own business. Come on, we're not young anymore. My beloved daughter, I have wronged you. The first time I lay my eyes on you, I knew you were the best thing to have ever happened to me. Can you forgive me? -Can we go on with the game now? -Let's go. People think they need to be number one, what they really need is to be loved. Why isn't my father like that? Sorry, excuse me. -We're here. -Fatt. -You're enjoying this, aren't you? -Isn't that a good thing? -Dad, mom, people are watching. -I can't bear to be apart from you. Dad, mom, let's play mahjong. -Yes. -We have to be apart again. -I'll make this quick. -I can't bear for us to be apart, hurry. Be good. Take care of him. So handsome. Pak Chong Fatt, are you a man? You're okay with your wife treating you this way? What do you know about love? Is there something wrong with your father? Let's play. And look at your wife. She just took my money, and now she's on your side cheering you on. So unprofessional. No wonder you're married to each other. Shuffle the tiles. Seven Character. Five Circles. -In-between. -Pong. Three Bamboos. I'll take that. Eight Circles. -In-between. -I'll take that. Flowerless, Concealed, Sequence Hand win with a single Eight Circles, three points. This is mere luck. You won't be lucky everyday. Whatever. -Nine Character. -Pong. Six Character. -Two Circles. -I'll take that. -Three Bamboos. -Pong. -One Bamboo. -Something to take again. Are you nuts? All these years you've been the King of Mahjong, your daughter has been unhappy. Are you happy? One has polio, one is pea-brained. Just play. -Eight Character. -Pong. I win. I am destined to win today, no matter whose side you're on. Do you remember when we were young? Master told us a story about the wind and the sun? He's been such a dumbass since we were young. Six Bamboos. Eight Bamboos. Five Circles. Three Character. Dad, he has all the suits. I'm sure he's building The Thirteen Wonders. It won't be that easy. Why would Wong Tin Ba build The Thirteen Wonders? The focus should be on the Green Dragon now. Seven Bamboos. Two Character. Everything is going so well. Pong. Don't rush it. Everyone can tell I'm waiting for the Green Dragon tile. Yet you discarded it? Are you out of your mind? Because all you care about is winning or losing. Green Dragon. I should thank you. Because of your ploy, I found my wife. And my daughter reunited with her mum. Brother... This Green Dragon is just a mahjong tile. I'll give it to you if you like. So we are really poles apart. It feels as though Pak Chong Fatt is not a mere human being. He's like... He is... Right, that's him. Wukong, you want the Green Dragon tile? I have it. It always gets in my way shall I give it to you? Wukong... You're good at playing mahjong, but you have no integrity. You've won. Why don't you play? Green Dragon. Game. The Thirteen Wonders. Do you think we had more fun playing mahjong when we were kids? Or now? Playing mahjong. To me, playing mahjong is about having a good time. Winning or losing is not important. I understand now, master. Understood. I'm hungry, let's go. -I want a roasted chicken drumstick. -Sure. The winner of the 12th World King of Mahjong Championship is... None other than our boss, Wong Tin Ba. Who else could it be, other than our boss? Come, say it with me. Wong Tin Ba! Cut the crap, let's go eat. Yeah, let's go. Hubby... What do you want now? I feel very guilty, are you mad at me? Let's not talk about this anymore. The most important thing is for our family to stay together. That's right, you're the best. Pak Chong Fatt. What do you want? I want to have a word with your father. If they don't sound right to you, give me two slaps. What do you want? I have been very worried that I won't win again after my luck runs out. But I understand today, that as long as I have you as a brother, it's hard for me to lose. I'm not the only one you have around you. All right, bye. Hey... Are you two going to leave just like that? I know I was wrong to curse you with polio. But you're my daughter and I'm your dad, we're family. Let's make up, shall we? I can even give up my title of King of Mahjong. Sorry. I'm sorry. You can be so gentlemanly, Dad. How can you leave just like that? Don't forget you've killed Little Mosquito. I would be left alone if you leave. Our house will become so cold. You want me to freeze to death? Stay so you can continue to help me. Okay? Thank you, boss. -Green Dragon, hurry up. -Sassy. Nine Circles. -Be careful. -Hurry up. -Two Circles. -Pong. You're so stupid. There's no fool in mahjong what matters most is to be happy, right? Don't scold him. Why do the kitchens of these rich people feel so hot? Oh, that's because you are clinging onto me. Food must be served on time during CNY. Didn't you say you like it when I pretend to be a koala bear? Brother... This is the kitchen, not the bedroom. I asked you to cook rice not fry rice. It's been 20 over years I can't help myself. Speaking of which, the Legendary Kung fu that Master taught you, what was it for? How did he know? I think those vegetables have been overcooked. Boss... You've got mail. Brother... -Seems like it's from master. -Yes. Fatt, this is your master. Excuse me, please come back. Fatt, how have you two been? -Master. -First of all, congratulations. I heard you're still the King of Mahjong. I'm so proud of you and happy for you. But nothing beats knowing you two are on good terms again. That is great news indeed. I am doing really great over here. I have blondes as my disciples. Business is booming and they all call me professor. Professor. America is a democratic country. They're all very open-minded. Your master practices the Legendary Kung fu, right? Have you been practicing the great condor? I'm not going back anymore it's so much better here. Remember the "great condor", Fatt? -Ah "Fuck"? -Not this "Fuck", I meant that "Fatt". Alright that's all, bye. Shut it down, bye. Your turn. -Let's take some pictures. -Stand here. This is for big brother. Come on, look here. -Sorry, master. -It's okay. Remember not to tell anyone I'm practicing the Legendary Kung fu. I won't. You're practicing the Legendary Kung fu for mahjong, right? It is the Legendary Kung fu all right, but not for mahjong. They're for the "condor". Condor? Mahjong players spend a lot of time seated which is very bad for the prostate. I get it now. Come here. Brother... You said after listening to master's recording you regained your confidence to play mahjong. Did master leave any message for me? Yes or no? If I press this button everything will be history. How does that make me different from a dog? Quit horsing around, Fatt. You think no one knows. You listened to someone else's message. Mind your own business. You won't be coming back to find me. Scared, aren't you. Screw you. How is playing mahjong a gambling addiction? It's a good form of entertainment. That's right. These people betrayed the original intent of mahjong. They should be cursed for eternity. Punished for their atrocities. Give them two slaps every time you see them. Four slaps when you see them the next time. Six slaps when you see them the third time. See... Therefore, we have to play mahjong with the right attitude. Play it as a healthy form of entertainment. Play it to express your love towards a cultural treasure. Gong Xi Fa Cai and Happy Lunar New Year. May you all be surrounded by happiness. May all your wishes come true. And you'll have everything that your heart desires. Gong Xi. Gong Xi. Happy Lunar New Year to everyone. Let's get rich!
