Here we are on the Harvard campus. A boy and a girl. I'm the boy. You know your little Penelope wants to marry you, darling. But first go west and collect your inheritance, the vast fortune your father left you. Very few people recognize me from this angle. Not a classic head, haven't I? You should see when they take the cork out! But enough chit chat! On with the story. This girl is mad about me. No, don't kiss me! Imagine any girl saying that to me? Silly child! I like to kiss this girl because she has the kind of lips that I like. One on the top and one on the bottom. Go now Junior! Get your money. And remember, I love you! Love you! Love you! I'm about to turn to you, lucky people. Fasten your safety belts! Don't be impatient! Please hold the applause, you might miss the plot. Magna cum laude. Magna cum laude! It's Latin meaning: If you folks drive home after the show, be sure and use a car. What's this? This is an old character actor on the Paramount lot we try to keep working. He's supporting a large family. But I guarantee you this fellow will not be in the picture tonight! Well sir, on with the show... I'll be waiting! And though you face grave danger, Be brave. Be fearless! For remember darling, you are Junior, son of Paleface! The Sheriff! Let's go! Good afternoon, Governor Freeman. HI Doc. Roy! Hello Roy. We were on our way to meet you. Why this? I use the service entrance! You see governor, when I'm assigned a case, I trust no one. Not even your personal guards. Seems we got the right man Doc. That's what I told you, governor. What's you plan Roy? The plan is to wait and watch. I don't think we'll have to wait too long. You see, all the hold ups have taken place in this area. And with the gold was stolen from these points, I figure the town of Sawbuck Pass must be the Torch's headquarters. Doc, I'll meet you there in the morning and get things set up. I'll be there. Now be careful Roy. If Torch ever finds out you and Doc federal agents there, you'll never get out alive. We have before. You see governor, I disguise myself with a song, and Doc hides behind a bottle of patent medicine. I'll see you later! Hey trigger! Trigger! Trigger! Come here, boy! Hurry up there boy! We're off to Sawbuck Pass... Hold it Trigger! And now ladies and gentlemen, my partner and his four-legged friend have only told you only a few, only a few of the curative powers of Doc. Lovejoy's wonder tonic. Now who's to be the first to walk up here and purchase a clean bill of health for only one dollar? Hey Doc! I'd like to buy a bottle for the sheriff. He's suffering from Torch trouble! That ain't funny, mister! Ain't funny? The bandit is stealing our gold. It's getting so nobodys safe. The next thing you know the Torch will be riding in and shooting up the town. Somebody must be smoking a full pack! Easy folks! It's only me! Only me! That's the understatement of the year. Well, we must move ahead. Here we go! Oops! Sorry. Out of my way! I'm a Harvard man! Watch out, here he comes again! Help! Your going to run into me! A scratch! Look a scratch on my mud guard! Sheriff! Where's the sheriff here. I'm the sheriff. Oh your the man? Well sheriff run to the corner and get me a croocked lawyer. How'd you like that? Look at that fellow rolling in the mud! Arrest him for drunk driving. I'm an innocent man and if you have any justice in you, you'll accept my bribe. What is the big idea? Look what you did to our wagon and my horse! Quarantine that beast! He's got the chickenpox! Listen you! Please... lips that touch liquor shall never touch mine! I never touched a drop in my life! Somebodys been putting bourbon in your toothpaste. Why you...! Get your hands off of me! I'm engaged to be married. And you stop puckering up! I wouldn't kiss you either. Now look Sheriff, I want... Please, no dancing. Just a minute! You'll pay for that wagon stranger, or you go to the hoosegow. Who gow? Oh the hoosegow? Hold on. You can't put a Harvard man in jail, it's unsanitary. What are you going to pay for that wagon with? Preposition at the end of a sentence. Next thing you know he'll be dangling his partisible. Shame on you! The school marm will certainly hear about this, sir! Now can one of you peasants direct me to the bank? I'm here to claim the inheritance left to me from my daddy Paleface Potter. You Paleface's son? Your starring right at him! Hey Lib! Son Paleface is here! Paleface! Paleface? Hurry up! He's going to read the will. C'mon, he's going to get his money! And so I, Paleface Potter, the greatest Indian fighter to ever hit the West, being of sound mind, I bequeath to my son Junior my entire fortune. The reason I leave all of my money to my son Junior, is being of sound mind... Well I won't bother to read the last paragraph Junior, it's mearly an expression your father's love for you. Just a minute! I was so young at the time, I don't remember the things daddy said about me. He poured out his heart in this will, I'd kinda like to read it. The reason I leave all of my money to my son Junior, is being of sound mind I can't leave my money to my wife because I ain't never forgiven her since she presented me with an idiot for a son. I was the only child. But this idiot is all I got in the world, which shows you what a lousy spot I'm in. I never knew dad felt that way about me. I always knew I was kind of a shnook, but I'm a nice shnook, ain't I? Even at Harvard I took a course in good shnookery. I'm sorry, Junior. All Dad's friends liked me. What a reception, all those smiling faces out there. Some of those faces out there aren't smiling Junior. You see, your father left town in a hurry. He left owing alot of bills to alot of people. They expect to be paid out of the money you inherit. There's your father's chest Junior. Hasn't been moved since he put it there Here's the key. It's a Yale lock. I wish I had my gloves! Mr. Thorne, can I see you for a moment? I'll be right away Waverly. I'll be right back Junior. If they hang Junior Potter they should be ashamed of themselves! For his sake I hope he find lots of gold. The way that mobs acting, he'll need it. Look at hat big fellow with the block and tackle! While they'll tear him limb from limb! This whole thing makes me sick to my stomach. Well Junior will be worse than sick in his stomach if he doesn't bring that gold out here. You hold them off, I'll go get him. Gold! Thousands of gold dollars. Gold! I got gold! It's all there. Gold slippers, gold trinkets. My daddy's gold! I got gold rocks, gold stones, gallstones, gold gallstones. I am rich! I got millions I tell you! Junior! I'm alright. Waverly, come here quick! Gold! I got gold! Now I can afford a Gabardine hat for summer . Gold! I got millions! I say we string him up right now. We'll never get paid. He's got tricky eyes like his old man. My bill has been due over 30 years! Please listen to me! Mr. Potter is suffering from shock. The sight of all that money in his father's strongbox was just too much for him. Your bills will all be paid within 2 days according to the terms of Paleface's will. Should I take you to the hotel, Mr Potter? Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter! Can anyone call me nugget? We want our money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Darling, they're playing our song! He won the West. He won it using loaded dice! My daddy! How can I ever thank you for all the money you left me? And I know you didn't mean to die daddy mine. Without paying your bills, you just kinda keeled over before you could open a fat Western wallet. I know you're happy there, branding those stray angels and plucking on your harp, and sings "Buttons and Bows" and ka-ja-jipi-a-jo-ja-jam. Many winters ago winter, Paleface kill my braves. Now Yellow Cloud, kill son of Paleface. How! How. Me likem send message, my girl Penelope. Harvard University, Boston Mass. Care, tool house, girls entrance. Message? Me found no money.

Signed: Heep Big Penelope. The big double crossing little Heep! And to think she was going to be mother of my idiot papoose! I hope she can't keep up the payments on the ring! Thanks for the wardrobe. Never trust any fillys from Boston! Psst! Psst! Gazuntite! Watch that. Psst! Psst! I was just checking his hat size. 8 and a half AA. Thank you! I'm donating a large portion of my vast wealth to charity. I'm going to see every horse gets a new Easter outfit. I'm sorry, those trousers won't be ready until tomorrow. I had to cut a hole on the side so he can get his tail through. Wouldn't be comfy walking around with a seat full of hair. Well, times a wasting, and I have to get down to the livery stable for more fitting. Livery stable? So you can get into your horseless carrage and skedaddle out of town before your 2 days are up! Your just your old Pa! He was the lyingest, crookedest, mangyest, rottenest, lowdown critter that never drew a sober breath. Say, you really knew my daddy! Didn't ya. You sir have cast dispersions on my dear old daddy! That brave, lowdown, mangy, crooked drunken hero who won the West. And If you weren't as weak and as old as you are... You are weak and old, aren't you? You are! Put up your dukes! Come on in the name of my dear old daddy, who lies sleeping in a Boston cemetery, I demand a satisfaction! If I didn't defend the honour of the Potter name, my Daddy would turn over in his grave! You know, nobody's going to have any suspicions of two fellows hanging around just to get their wagon fixed. Lucky those two bumped into us. You know I've got a hunch that he's going to run us into more luck. Good evening! How's our wagon coming along? Gonna be ready by tomorrow. That soon, huh? We figured you might be too busy seeing to that college fellow didn't sneek out of town town. If he tries to leave town, I'll smash his brains in! I wouldn't do that, you might get in trouble with the law. Be just as easy to unfix his transportation. We'll be seeing you! You kinda got interested in young Potter's son's life. Didn't you Roy You know Doc, I'm interested in alot of things! I am interested in music... And I am interested in Mr. keep Potter in town. Unless I miss my guess, his father's gold will create alot of interest with a certain party. Five thousand, 30 thousand and 35 thousand. And I know where the next bundle is coming from. Since when are you make the plans? Something you otta know Mike, this afternoon... I know. A couple of strangers, medicine men came into in town. I don't mean them... Junior Potter came from the east to get his father's gold. Alright fellas! I'll take care of Mr JR. Potter. This is going to be my own private party. And where do I come in? Don't ever come to a party unless your invited! Forget about Mr. Potter. As soon as I get him under a full moon, I'll empty his father's chest. So you see boy, that's how I know that chest of your Pa's was as empty as his head. Dad's head wasn't empty. I know 'cause Mother used to rattle it for me when I was a baby. Your Pa and me were partners boy. Paleface Potter and Ebeneezer Hawkins. Prospecting by day and prospecting by night. Hey, tell me about the nights? Take some! Don't you get the demitasse size? You look pale, you're color has left your cheeks. I know, my blood's going down to my hip pocket to count my money. Your Pa wouldn't put his gold in the bank. He didn't trust banks. He was too crafty for that But he hid the gold somewhere! This water is warm. Well then your Pa had to get back to Boston before he had a chance to tell me where he hid the gold. But he must have told you. Dad was too crafty, to tell anything to an idiot. Stop feeling bad boy! You gotta start thinking! Your Pa must have said something. You've got to remember where he hid his gold! 'Causen if we find it boy, we'll be rich! Gold! Gold! Millions and Billions! Gold! Gold! I've got goldshot eyes. Gold! Gold! Steady Ebe! We did that bit. Now you got to start thinking. No wonder that water was warm! Hey, Doc, there goes our bait. Sure good to hear you dreamt to settle down in Sawbuck Pass boy. Smile. Smile. Yes, I was thinking seriously of squandering my fantastic fortune here here. Sort of a endowed college branch of Harvard. Sawbuck endings with a built-in lampoon. We better stick close. Yes, if your right he should lead us to the Torch. I remember the time that daddy was telling me about when he fought a redskin with one hand tied behind his back. Beat him to a pulp too. Of course it might have been a diffrent story if that redskin hadn't had one hand tied behind his back. Oh daddy loved killing Indians. He didn't consider his day complete unless at least one redskin bit the dust. Some of those dopey looking Indians bit so much dust that they had to brush their teeth with a wisk broom. I thought you were wood! Like... You've heard of wooden Indians, huh? Come in! Sorry, no table without a reservation. Do you get it? Reservation. That's a joke like in... Well. You see, I'm the son of Paleface. You've heard about Paleface, the great Eskimo fighter? Hated Eskimos, hated 'em. They taught him how to rub noses and I inherited this! I was. Well... Don't take any wooden Indians. I mean wooden nickels. Wooden nickels. That reservations pretty funny. You know... Oh well. That's the big difference between Dad and me. Having an education, I believe on letting Indians live. Poor old Dad never had any schooling. He was a selfmade moron. Course I'm different I only associate with intellectuals. This sounds like a intellectual joint! Glad you got your formal on! How am I doing? Fine boy! We got 'em fooled! Now keep acting like your your Pa's chest is loaded. But keep thinking... I keep thinking of this. Well Hold on folks! Hold on! You all know Junior, son of Paleface, the rich millionaire! I've been making speaches all day and I'm a little tired. But I guess you want me to say a few words. The drinks are on Junior Potter! Those weren't words! Now act like you got millions. Sign the checks like your Pa used to. And remember your not a mouse, your a man! You peeked! Give this millionaire something that'll put hair on his chest. I've got hair on my chest. Give me something that will part it in the middle! What'll you have? I'll have a "Horse's Neck". How about you? No use killing two horses? Your father's favorite drink. One Paleface special, coming up! You having a straight celery tonic? Aren't you glad you wrote that letter to Santa? Did you think of anything yet? I'll say. She's really got it. She's got what? I don't know, but if we can be bottled it, we could make a fortune! Bury this kid, he's dead! What's the matter? Don't you like girls? I'll stick to horses, mister. Horses! Horses? Horses! That's ridiculous! That's the boss of this place! She's rich. Rich? You mean she's got money too? She's got pubs around California. She's not so bad around North and South Dakota either. How about "California Rose"? "Cloud in my Valley of Sunshine"! "Am I in love"! Hold it fellas, one at a time! Let's have "Buttons and Bows". That's a favorite song of my wealthy daddy, Paleface Potter. Melancholy Baby! What would you like, Mr. Potter? What would I like? Can't we discuss the matter in a nice quiet place? Like the cellar of my hotel? Or maybe you'd like to take a stroll through the rock quarry? You see, at college I majored in geology and anthropology and running out of gas in Bunkerhill. What's your name, honey? My friends call me Mike. That's a pretty masculine handle for such a feminine pot of goodies. Mind if I take pot luck? Maybe the girl don't want to be bothered. Sir, I resent this intrusion! You have the nerve, the audacity the guts! Pardonne-moi, ma'am. You have the guts to interrupt. Again, pardonne-moi ma'am. Now, vamoose! Now let's see. Where were we? Put that gun away! Yah. Let that be the thought for the day. I otta blowout his yellow liver! Blowout my liver? You'd mess up the onions. Put it away! You heard her! Give me back my yellow liver, it matches my spine. You know I don't believe in shooting. Someday you'll be sorry your so tender-hearted. Tender heart never won tender liver. I always say. I guess I was pretty stern with him! How about that deal in the cellar... Excuse me, ma'am... Your excused. I'm talking to the lady. Who do you think I'm talking to, a duck? Just a minute! Let the man talk. We don't need him. Yes. I happen to know the song the stranger requested. Would you like to sing it? Fine, fine! Here we go! What do you got in your pockets? Excuse me. Well, let's have it! Here's mud in my throat! Put a head on it! Yes? Sorry! Who's there? It's Junior Potter, boy millionaire. Can I come in? I'm taking a bath! Can you come out? I mean when you're through taking a bath. I'd to take for a little spin in my horseless carriage. We can park in some nice dark spot and I can show you the luminous dial on my watch. I mean, we could palaver and sort of figure out the best way to lavish my rich daddy's fortune on you. Well I'd love to talk about your daddy's gold. But don't get the idea I'm mercenary. I like you for yourself Junior. The way you look. I think you're the handsomest man in the world! I wouldn't say that, but I appreciate your honesty. Now that I know how you feel about me, I wanna releave your mind and tell you I'm not going to play hard to get. Before you know it you'll be kissing me full on my soft, warm, red lips. Oh how I envy her! I'd be very happy to take a ride with you Junior. As soon as I get out of the tub. Out of the tub? Really? (Mouths something) You should have heard that line. No. No I couldn't do it! It wouldn't be fair! I'd be a cad! Besides, my eyeball might get stuck. Look let's go! My car is parked down at the livery stable. I'll meet you there at midnight. You run along now, Junior. Oh no, I wouldn't think of leaving you unprotected like this. You being in the water A couple of Annapolis men might come along, and you know how those sailors are. Anchors away and all that! I'll stand right here and guard your door. Little lady! Hup two three four. Yes? Good bye! You got no time for romance, boy! You got to think! I've been doing plenty of thinking. I didn't go to college 14 years for nothing! I've got it all figured out. It just so happens, the richest girl in town is crazy about me. You mean Mike? By tomorrow she will be Mrs Mike Potter. Don't you get it? I marry her. This is California. Community property. I divide her money. With my half, I'll pay my stingy old daddy's bills. The rest is gravey. But we'll have that woman on our hands! Please, keep your hands out of my gravey! Now if you give me your word you'll take a bath, you can be my best man. Well, here we go! Where is it? Open them up wide Ebe. I going to wiz on to fame and fortune. Crazy... Hey Junior! So long Ebe! Say you've grown in the last few minutes. I ain't growed. They took your tires boy. to keep you from getting out of town. Took my tires? How dare they? Don't they realize I'm a Harvard man and my gravey is getting cold. Where are they? My tires! My tires! Where are they? They're up there Junior, chained to the rafters. How do you like that? Now I have to cancel my date until tomorrow night. It's not human for a girl to wait 24 hours, even for me! Why you four legged glue pot! I hope all your children have fat mounted policemen on them! I was only joking! No sense of humour, get out. Manager! Where's the manager? Don't get up madam, I just came in to use your window. Looks like your plans are working out, Roy. I need help, governor. Anything I can do. Alright. Start those gold shipments moving again tonight.

Good afternoon, Miss Mike. Good afternoon. Nice white horse you got there. Yes, I just got him in time to take me my wedding with Mr. Potter. I had a brown horse you know but somebody stole him last night. Shame! I liked him alot. You like animals, eh? Then it's only humans you have a beef against? I find that animals mind their own business. Then if you don't like humans. Why are you getting married? Oh, I'm not marrying a human. I'm marring Mr. Potter. I found out last night. That when it comes to love Mr. Potter's an animal, a ball of fire! What did you do? Light a torch under him? You figured everything out think haven't you Mr. Federal man? Federal man? Why Miss Mike, you got me all wrong. See, I'm just a wondering minstrel. Come on Mike! We'll let you try on the bridal suite for size. You got no case, Roy. She has a perfect alibi for last night. You just keep her in there sheriff. I'll break her perfect alibi. Sounds hollow but how do you get to it? Your pa hid something, he really hid it . Ya, I remember once my aunt said he hid in a broom closet for 2 weeks. Of course my mom didn't know the maid was in there with him. A the gentle rapping of a woman. Mike! Oh you darling! Soon I will have all your money! Bye darling! Open up or I'll break this door to smithereens! Junior, look here! It's in your pa's handwriting! It says "To my young idiot son, Junior and my old idiot partner Ebeneezer Hawkins". From Paleface. He spells idiot with two "Ts"! Hold 'em off, Junior! Hold 'em off. You always do the dirty work, don't you? Gold hidden in the hotel in Sterling City. Junior the gold is here! We're rich! I found it! We're rich! Let's see it! We're rich. We're rich. We're rich. We're rich. We're rich. Check your main spring! Let me see that will ya. No, no! You might tell someone where the gold's hid. Me? But I won't...! Nobody will see it! Hey, wait a minute! We are rich! We are rich! We're rich. We're rich. Well come in! It was kinda chilly and we just burning some old money. It's empty! That ain't gold. "Ain't" is vulgarism frowned upon in polite circles. Since "Isn't" is the contraction of "is not". Remember the verb motifier rule "I nay sanctorus regalorum (?)". Which means. "You ain't laying your dirty paws on me fat boy!" If anything happens to me boy, you'll never know where the gold is. They'll contact me in Sterling City! Take a message from the spirit world! Out of the way! Out of the way! To the hotel! I've got to get to Sterling City! Wups. Forgot no tires. Sterling City, here I come! Why he's headed for the desert Roy. Ya, he's our one chance to keep the Torch behind bars. We gotta get to him before the buzzards do! Ahh, this is great! Fine time to conk out on me you, you mechanical rat! Just when the gold is within my reach! I otta pull the hair out of your seat by the roots! Hey, Martin and Lewis! No hitchhikers please, it's a state law! Get off! Alright, alright. Remember no smooching in the balcony! Two days! He must be crazy with the heat by now. You never can tell! This heat might tend to make him sane. Stop staring at the menu! You think I'm a buzzard burger, your mad. The heats getting me I tell you, the heat! It's that desert madness. That's what they call it. You getting kinda dizzy? Sure, sure that's the first sign. It's usually accompanied by a ringing in the ears. Excuse me. Helloooo! Who? Cambridge 823? No, Penelope, not now. No no. I'd like to, but I'm taking a shower with a couple of friends. Thirsty, aren't you? You want water huh? Stare! Go ahead, stare! You'd die for water! Water! Water! It's only a mirage. You thought I'd be fooled, didn't you? I know when it's a mirage when I see one. I'm a college man! Who said you had to dress for dinner? Don't shake your head to me in that tone of voice! Ask them if they saw a white man go by. I was peaches, I was cream. I was captain of the team. STERLING CITY Hey Ebe! Where are you? Here I am Ebe, it's Junior! How charming! Looks like a Yale dormitory! Water! I can't drink that, the glass is cracked. Fine hotel, hot and cold running dirt. Hey Ebe! Ebe, are you still here? Or did you find the money? First mirror I've ever seen with a hangover! Oh hi Ebe! Say I've been looking for you. Did you cut yourself shaving or did you have a high tooth pulled? Ebe! Ebe! Ebe! Wake up! Wake up! He's dead, Junior. Dead? It seems that way. I wonder who did it? Why did you kill him? You fool! It was his own fault. He wouldn't tell me where the gold was hidden. When I get out of here... When you get out of here, the boys and me will be long way off. You ain't making no plans, no more Mike! Why don't you start being honest Potter! Your going to hang for killing Hawkins. So you might as well come clean. Where was the girl that night about 9 o'clock? I told you. I told you! We were dancing! Come on Potter we haven't got much time, so start talking and start fast! The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. Listen Doc, I'll stay here until I break him down. You report to the governor. Well is it alright? He might get away in his car? Not a chance, I hid the crank. And he can't get away on Trigger because Trigger is a one man horse and nobody can ride him but me. Woh woh! Where are you going? Down, down! Stay on your feet! Where do you think you're going? You can't go upstairs, you're not registered! Hey, what's the idea? Mike, you know I love you. I loved you ever since I first time saw you Mike. Leave those covers where they are! Lay off the covers I tell you! Do you want me to steal your teeth? We can do this all night if one of us doesn't give up. Did you see the governor? I never got that far Roy. The Torch broke out of jail last night. She'll be heading for Potter. If she gets there first well never break her alibi. Hey honey, here I am! I'll meet you in the lobby, third cobweb from the left. Boy am I happy to to see you! Hey Mike darling. You came here to save me, huh? Save you? Who from? From the horse lover. Old saddle soap britches. He's been keeping me prisoner. He's been trying to get me to say I wasn't with you that night. Where is he? I don't know but he'll be back. We gotta get out of here. They've they been abusing my baby? I hate to tell you who I slept with last night. Those cold hoofs in my back... We'd better go! This is a nice and quiet place, let's stay here awhile. Quiet? You can get a room with an adjoining hole in your head. I'll be right down. This could be our honeymoon hotel. Honeymoon... You mean our honeymoon? Yours and mine. Without a preacher? Why I asked a preacher to meet us here. Oh boy! I know this is going to be a happy marriage because... You're a woman, and I'm a man, and those are the people that usually get married. Mike... As soon as you get rid of those whiskers. That'll be easy, I used to pluck turkeys at a Boston market. Don't go away, I'll get dressed. I gotta go and freshen up Junior, but you're a dear. Your an antelope. Later on we'll go out the range and play. Where's Mike? Right behind you! Boy what a wife! You'll be great when it comes time to chop the wood! Put him in the chair. He don't need a haircut, just trim his up a little. Put him in the chair! Yes Madam! Say. What are you going to do? Get around behind him and hold him. That's right, tie him up so he won't bother us. It's going to be real fun honeymooning in Niagara Falls! My daddy spent a whole week there in his honeymoon. Laughing, loving, drinking champagne. He had so much fun there, he kinda wished mother could have been with him! You'll love it there! You can see the sights and take a shower at the same time. Hey, he's not tied tight enough, I can still move one of my arms. Which one? This one here, see? Ah, that's it! Now I couldn't get out even if I tried. I couldn't? Hey honey, what am I a wedding present? Look, I'm gift wrapped! Shut up! Shut up? You can't talk like that to me until after we're married. She's not going to be marrying anybody. She's going to kill us both. Not me, that'll would be silly! Besides it would take a little of the kick out of my honeymoon. You're not so smart, Mr Federal man. I don't have to kill you either one of you gentlemen. They'll do it. They're coming to get the Harvard man, but they'll get you too. So long gents! Just a minute, Miss Delroy! So you found out my real name too. Yes, and I found out your father was swindled out of his fortune by old Paleface. Mike. The governor knows an injustice was done you. You haven't killed anyone yet. So why start now. I'll do all I can to get you off with a short sentence. How do I know you're telling the truth about the short sentence mister? You'll just have to believe me. We'll talk about that later. I'll stop the Indians before it's too late. Son of Paleface, there! Alright, don't stop, I'm beginning to like it. I must have been crazy! All my life I'm going around knocking on doors with my hands. When Trigger sees the spot we're in, he'll get us out. He's got horse sense. If he had sense, he wouldn't be a horse! Help! Help! Let me down! My nose will bleed! Close the door. Were you brought up in a barn? Trigger, the knot. Untie the knot! Hurry up! They're coming! Stop tasting it! Bite it! Fine government agent you are. No guns. You think you'd be ready for a situation like this? As a citizen and taxpayer almost I... Gee dad! It's a Winchester! Boy, if you had a bass fiddle, we could could hold this fort all winter! There's too many of them. I can't fight them off alone. Ah, force yourself. I'll get you a gun. I'm with right you boy. Don't stand there, get something! There's your gun! Go get it! No dice! What? That means "Me go out there?" There's another gun. Listen, just how big a coward are you? I was the captain of the Olympic team. Hey, the kid with the beach blonde tail isn't doing anything. How about him going to get it? Your dad would sure be ashamed of you. I certainly am! Pa! Daddy! It's me! Your own flesh and idiot. Don't shame the name of Potter! Go get that gun! Oh, but those Indians? It's hot out there! It's hotter where I come from! This "H" don't stand for Harvard, son. Now get out there! Ya, but I'll get killed and I'll be dead like you! You think that's bad? You all whistling for me, honeychild? She's from the south end of the furnace. She's got a younger sister. Free, red and twenty-one. I'll get the gun! I thought you afraid to die? Not anymore! One side boy, I'm taking over! You sure fooled me Junior. That was really shooting! Ya, I've been around! We haven't got a chance just the two of us. Three of us. You sure stopped those Indians. Well, I'll stop a couple right now! Listen, Junior and I will try to hold them off. You ride into Sawbuck Pass and tell Doc Lovejoy to send out the cavalry. They shot my horse out from under me! You drive her, Junior. You stole my crank! I hid it under your seat. No wonder I had trouble walking! Come on Mike! Hey look! The moose got shot in his jackpot! It's gold! It's my daddy's gold! That's where he hid it! C'mon! Wait. We'll need some for our marriage license. Ho Paleface, take off! Junior, look! Beat it or your going to make the whole thing unbelievable. Hand me that bag! What? The bag, in the back seat. Hey Junior! There's your wheel! Come back! Go get my wheel, I'll hold that. Here! If we lose three more wheels, we'll have to think of something. Hurry up! Hurry up! This is impossible! I'm going to town. You keep them following you. I'll go to town. You keep them following you! Junior we're stuck! Get out and do something! I'll get out, but I guarantee nothing. The Indians are coming! Get in front and pull! Pull, it's a nice thing to say to Harvard man! We're moving! We're moving! Either that or the scenery's slipping. Junior, I don't know how to drive this thing! Where are ya? I'm down here checking the oil. Hey Junior, there's a big rock in the road ahead! Don't hit it or we'll loose two rear ends. Hey! We've got a hitchhiker down here! Bring the gold upstairs and hurry up! Get the wagon! Need any help? Back to the bridge! Junior! You're going back the same way! Alright alright! I'll marry you! Junior! Happy day for you hey Junior? Your wife getting out. Yes, she finally served her sentence. I'm taking her back to Boston. You've sure been a faithfull husband waiting all these years. It wasn't so bad. After all I saw Mike on visiting days. But you know, it wasn't any fun talking to the woman you love through a wire screen. Well here she is now! Yours? Let's see them top this on television!
