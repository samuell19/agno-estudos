I would guess that if you walk into a crowded casino, maybe ten percent of those customers think they're advantage players. But of those ten percent fewer than one percent have any hope of actually taking any substantial amount of money out of a casino. Casinos don't like it when they get people in there who have the expectation of walking out the door with more money than they walked in with. Any card counter knows that heat comes quickly if you're counting cards. It's the thing that casinos look for first. The casinos feel emotionally toward card counters, the way they feel towards cheats. So they hate you. For the past four decades blackjack players have been saying, "Oh the game is over. It's the end of times. We're not going to get to play anymore because a new technology comes along." When I started playing in 1978 from that moment and every single year since then, I have had people tell me blackjack is dead. It's over. You can't make money anymore. And then we went and made ten million dollars or whatever it was. And KC started his career. So, it all depends on how you look at it. Most people realize the game of blackjack is vulnerable and can be beaten. But very few people take the time to master the skills necessary to do it and/or build the required bankroll to play professionally. When I started playing blackjack, I knew I wanted to play at the highest stakes available. I started playing at a very young age. I had a subscription to Arnold Snyder's, "Blackjack Forum." I read every issue cover to cover. I loved it. Realizing there were people beating casinos for a living, I was attracted to it. I would read books, go to websites. Check out the forums. I had a computer software I'd practice on, on a regular basis. And at the time, I was playing very low limits, learning the game, learning how to play, learning techniques, and I slowly built up a bank roll over the years. I learned a lot of hard lessons. I went broke a few times, but it's when I really became a professional. There was a definitive point where I went from playing under the radar at lower states recreationally without giving my ID, I decided I was going to set up credit lines and play at high stakes. It took me years and years to get to that point, I not only had the bankroll but I also had the skills to play blackjack at nosebleed stakes. This is where like my whole plan came together. And every weekend I was traveling from Berkeley, where I was a full-time student, to Las Vegas where I was working full-time as a professional blackjack player. It was a pretty exciting period of my life. My optimal high-limit strategy required disclosing my identity and establishing credit lines all over Las Vegas. I knew I only had one shot at this, once the casinos identify you as an advantage player, the whole game changes. I went to grad school with KC and while we were doing our homework together, I quickly understood that his lifestyle was not financed by working at Starbucks. What makes KC so good? I mean he's been playing the game for so many years, that any little edge he'll find, he'll take advantage of it and push it to its maximum. There's something extremely satisfying about beating a casino for a large sum of money, even better when they pick up your tab on an enormous weekend of extravagance. That's a great feeling. I'm not only winning. But them paying for the whole thing, knowing you had the advantage the whole way. And the whole time the casino was a sucker. Comps are what we give back to a customer who's willing to risk his money in the casino and play up to a certain level. We base comps on the level of play of a customer. The extravagant lifestyle afforded to casino high rollers seems frivolous but actually it's an important calculated element of a professional blackjack career. Comps range from room, to food and beverage, to spa, to expensive flight tickets, jet air fares, very expensive nightclub bills. We're talking about all the way to 50,000 dollars. For a big enough player, the sky is the limit. It adds up a lot. So it can probably add as much as twenty to forty percent to your overall expected earn per hour, if you really work the comp system well. Casinos are constantly looking for advantage players. So as a professional, a bit of acting is required. I'm ordering cocktails. I'm buying bottle after bottle of champagne--Cristal, Dom PÃ©rignon. I'm throwing a party in the high-limit pit. And as long as I am there gambling and partying in their eyes I'm not working. Hiding your skill, most people want to show off. A blackjack player wants to hide whatever skill he may happen to have. And the more you can act like a complete jerk the better off you are. So having some type of act you feel comfortable executing, really does distract them from evaluating your skills. In that timeframe, I beat the Hard Rock for 1.4 million, which is probably my greatest score in my blackjack career. I didn't know how long it was going to last. And it ends when you become so hot you can't enter a casino and you can't play. All of a sudden you're unwelcome. You don't know when that day is going to happen. There's a very drastic change from being welcomed to the casino to them basically throwing you out. And maybe even treating you like a criminal. The Casino has a surveillance department that's very good. Cameras everywhere, personnel trained to look for people that either might be cheating or counting cards. They don't care what you're doing, if you're a threat to their bottom line in any way, they get you out of their. The casinos have every right to bar you for doing an advantage play, for using your brain-- you hate it, but, yes, the casinos have the right to throw you out. Gambling is a state issue. Nevada law is that any business has the right to exclude anyone, for any reason or for no reason at all with the obvious exceptions of by statute, race, gender, other forms of discrimination. So casinos in Nevada have the right to exclude anybody they want. If they want to exclude card counters or people wearing green hats, they have the right to do it. And the casinos also have the right to 86 you, formally 86 you, which means to read you the Trespass Act, which means if you return, they can arrest you for having trespassed. The relationship between casinos and advantage players, it's a thin line of love and hate. APs hate the casinos for limiting their play. Same time APs love the casinos after crushing them. And the casinos hate them because they did. Your subsequent return to the premises will subject you to immediate arrest for trespassing. Some casinos are more friendly than others in getting rid of players. Some players are much more persistent than others in playing. In my opinion, the relationship between the casino and the advantage player should be a cat and mouse relationship. Obviously, I am biased. It seems there's some illegal conduct that goes on, either on the part of the casino or on part of the card counter. Most of the illegal conduct or immoral conduct is done by the casinos. The player also enters this environment under the assumption that the game is going to be fair and the casinos are going to act in a fair and legal manner. This is probably true for 99.9% of casino players. But for advantage players or players willing to risk enough money that could potentially disrupt the finances of the casino, this couldn't be further from the truth. Casinos, in my opinion, they are the worst of both worlds. They'll get people drunk. They'll take advantage of them. If you try to take advantage of them legally, they will employ illegal methods to stop you. It runs the gamut from illegal detentions, search and seizure, confiscating chips, cheating in the games. Casinos have refused to cash my chips. Casinos have stolen chips from me. I've had money illegally confiscated from me. I've been cheated numerous times. In the past, I have been drugged in the back, I've been punched, friends of mine had been burned with cigarettes, friends of mine have had their jaws broken, friends of mine have been threatened to be murdered. I've seen intentional payoffs against me. I've been arrested for crimes I didn't even commit. I know people who have been beaten up. I was once drugged by a casino. Casinos planted narcotics on a friend of mine that was being detained illegally. The list of casino crimes goes on and on with never anything but a slap on the wrist from local gaming authorities which are supposed to regulate games but we've found just protect casinos. People say is it dangerous to play in these casinos. And I immediately say, "No. I don't feel any danger. I never felt really, the danger, you know." But then I think about visiting Ken Euston, on his hospital bed when he had 73 broken bones in his face from a security guard that punched him just outside a casino in Reno. There is a safety issue. I generally feel I'm safe in a casino. Um, but it's not unusual for security to get out of line and overreact to the situation. This is part of the reason. They send out these bolo reports. They say, be on the lookout for this player. He's got this skill, this skill, and this history. And one here and one there and these casinos, freak out. Usually they tend to very quickly overreact and bring security, police and other goons to treat us like criminals. But playing is my job. It's what I do professionally. I want to play, I don't feel that I should quit playing just because they're aggressive, and willing to break the laws and intimidate me. From being both a player and a casino operator, I'm just kind of-- sometimes I'm amazed at some of the techniques that the casinos use to try to discourage card counters. As any card counter or other casino player would know that the hardest part about the game is avoiding the heat over an extended period of time. The casino's willingness to break the law and create a hostile environment for advantage players, forces advantage players to take countermeasures. I've used disguises. I use camouflage when I play. I use aliases. I would say creativity and hard work are the two most important characteristics that an AP can possess. I lasted for years. I had these accents, I was a Texan, I talked like this. Come on in, I'd hide whiskey, I'd put tea in there and I'd knock them down, order a double wild turkey, make it a quadruple wild turkey and a beer. And I'd already have an O'Doul's poured it into the beer I had. I'd have this one here. I'd knock them down, knock that down. I'm talking like this, acting like that, tipping like crazy. I've done some ridiculous things to try to avoid heat or detection or whatever. But they were kind of ridiculous and I got caught, I got dressed up as a woman. I mean, come on, you know. Welcome to "Gambling with an Edge." I'm Bob Dancer. - Hello, Richard. - Hello. Good to be here. All right. Tonight's guests will be KC, a professional gambler. At the time, in the peacock lounge which used to be the high-limit pit - in the Hard Rock. - Yes, right by the front door. Yep. They used to have chips with RFID that they used to rate you. As you bet these chips, there was a computer screen that the pit-boss had access to and it could see exactly how much you were wagering on every single hand. And I realized that if you took one of those chips and placed it underneath the table, it would also trigger in the betting circle. I wore Under Armour underneath my pants. Then, sewed these chips into the Under Armour. And I could lift my knee up, it would trigger as if I bet on top of the circle. - Underneath the table? - Exactly. Attention, advantage players, this is exactly the way the mind of an advantage player works. You automatically get extra 2,000 dollars on to your bet. You might be spreading from 100 to 500, but it looks like a spread from 2,100 to 2,500, which isn't much of a spread at all. - Exactly! - Something like that? It looked like I was betting pretty big. I might change my bet a little, when I go down to 500, I put the 1,500 and chips underneath the table, so it would still read as if it were 2,000. So my bet, according to their computer system, never looked like it was going between 2,000 and 3,000 all the time which isn't that big of a variation. And I think that they were very dependent on this technology. So, I was able to beat them up, pretty good. KC was one of those players that I noticed in the circuit. He was one of my players that I liked to follow because he had all these personas. He looked like a mountain man one day and GQ'ed up the next. I didn't really talk very much about the art of implementation because I feel that it would be presumptuous of me to talk about it when KC I think is better at it than I am. I am a professional blackjack player. I'm forced to evade the most advanced surveillance systems known to man. I'm scrutinized by biometric software. I'm constantly observed by casino personnel. My identity changes every day. This is the price I pay to be a winner. KC has taken this to some kind of new level, you know. The disguises he puts on, the variety and the IDs and all that stuff. I don't know anybody else who does it like that, to that degree. I was getting a lot of heat from the casinos, changed my look, grew a beard, grew my hair out, changed the way I dressed and I've been able to get back into the casino. So, I'm going to take another shot at them, start playing every day, see how things go. Yeah, so we just got booted from the Orleans. Unfortunately, he was on a tail end of a very good run of cards using a 100 dollar unit, one over 6,000 which was good. What did the guy say when he went up to you? He introduced himself. He was very friendly. "No more blackjack at any of the boy gaming properties." - Did he ask you who you were? - Nope. Didn't ask me. Probably knew I wouldn't tell him. Just to be safe when we left the property we jumped in a cab, circled around the block, came back and jumped in the car. When I walk out of a casino and I know I've just either been backed off, or trespassed, I never get into my car. They've got cameras all over. Even if you don't think they're following you, they are. We're going to head over to Silverton lodge. It's right on the outskirts of Vegas and work our way north from there. Just do as many hit and runs as we can. In and out, playing aggressively, you know. Most of these places I've been thrown out before. We're going to take dead aim at them until we have to go. The hair. To go or not to go? To cut or not to cut. My hair has been pretty good to me lately. You know, it's provided quite a bit of cover for me. The problem is it's very difficult to handle other day-to-day functions looking like the caveman. Fresh out of salon at the Palms, got my new haircut, my new look. We'll see how it goes. There's only one way to tell and we should go play. There's nothing like walking downtown 7:00 in the morning. Camouflage plays will efinitely help your longevity. Eventually, no matter how good you are, you will get caught. Duly appointed representative of the owner of this property, I hereby warn you you are trespassing according to the Trespassing Act as defined by Statute 207.200. Six a.m. Spent all night playing at a crappy casino. It's getting really tough. I'm not welcome in the city. I'm finding myself playing in, you know, poor casinos and off shifts at low limits. I've had two faces at this blackjack career. One, learning how to play, playing in lower limits, building my bankroll and two, playing at the highest limits as an invited Casino guest. But things have changed. Now, I'm a known entity, I can't play in Las Vegas anymore. I've come to a crossroads in my blackjack career. I need to determine, if I want to go down this road further. I'm going to have to leave Las Vegas, travel around the country to other casinos or, two, I'm going to have to find a new career. It's not clear to me what the right decision is. But it is clear to me that playing professional blackjack in Las Vegas is no longer an option. I think there might be another half a million out there for me to earn playing blackjack. There's so many casinos I haven't been to, I'd really like to spend one year in the RV, traveling around the country trying to extract as much as I possibly can out of the game of blackjack. So pulled on the road heading east, our nationwide blackjack tour begins. We just entered Louisiana, first town on the border in Shreveport, there's a nice group of casinos here at boomtown. And we're trying to work our way down to New Orleans which is going to be our home base as we take on all the casinos in this region here. I wanted to play my third session at Harrah's, New Orleans. And within five minutes, a casino manager trespassed me from the property. I hadn't gotten a lot of heat during my first two sessions but I had a lot of big bets out there. Probably got their attention, they may have rewound the footage and analyzed my play later and realized I was counting cards. Card counting is professional blackjack 101, the first technique an aspiring AP would learn. Counting is a simple technique, players sign values to cards, contract them as they are dealt. I use the high-low count and assign the value of plus 1 to 2 through 6, 0 to 7s, 8s and 9s and minus 1 to tens, face cards, and aces. As the cards are dealt in real time, values are added to create the running count. The running count needs to be adjusted by the decks remaining to establish an adjusted count or true count. The true count determines the player's edge or mathematical advantage or disadvantage which in turn determines how much a player wagers on any given hand. When the true count goes up, the player wagers more. When the true count goes down the player wagers less or not at all. Changes in true count determine strategy decisions. Similar hands are often played differently depending on the true count at the time the hand is dealt. On my first hand I have an ace seven or soft 18 versus the dealer's two. A basic strategy would suggest that I stand but because the true count is plus three, my strategy indicates I should double down in this situation. On my second hand I have six-three or nine versus the dealer's two. Again, basic strategy would suggest I hit in this situation but as the true count is plus three my strategy suggests that I deviate and double down in the spot. Using this strategy, an advantage player can expect to play with an advantage over the casino of approximately one percent. Changed my look, I'm going to try playing in another casino. I don't have much of a history with them, that might go well. Shit. Now they got a cop up here. He's turning his lights on coming to get me. Shit! - What disturbance? - I don't know. They said the white car, you're in the white car. The casino asked the Kenner, Louisiana police, to pull us over outside of the casino. Casino surveillance is trying very hard to get us to show identification which we're not going to do. We haven't broken the law. We didn't even play blackjack. - I have a supervisor coming to the scene. - Okay. I have one of their supervisors coming to the scene so we can see what we have going. We try to resolve this. I have no idea what they're talking about. That's what I'm trying. He just pointed to you. He said the white car, stop them they're causing a disturbance. That's where we're at right now. So give me a few minutes. Yeah we'd love to go, you know, it's... The casino manager who trespassed us from the property is now explaining to the officer why his security personnel asked him to pull us over. The good thing is the cop has no idea what to do. He said, "what do you want me to charge him with?" I think, the cop realizes we haven't done anything wrong. This guy is starting to sweat a little. Do you have some identification? Can I ask what the problem is? - I just need your ID. - Okay. Now they just extracted my ID out of me illegally. They finally figured it out. It's me. So, new disguise, new look. The two trespassings made it clear that Griffin was aware that I'm in this area. There's no doubt in my mind that they sent out a flyer with my picture on it-- updated picture to the local casinos. Griffin is a big thorn in any blackjack player's side. Griffin holds itself out as a detective agency that publishes an electronic database of purportedly known cheaters, advantage players, card counters, and other people who casinos might want to know who they are. It's very bad to be a card counter and get placed in the Griffin book. That's like considered somewhat traumatic the first time you find out that you're actually in the Griffin book. There's the famous black book called the Griffin book. This is a rogue copy given to me by another blackjack player. It's a little bit older version. They take a picture of you and disseminate it. And they file a report. This card player's here in town and blah, blah, blah. We got to work against them. It's a game of cat-and-mouse. We got to rotate. Session, session, session. Keep it small and quick. Three casino shifts. I'm going to change my outfit, every few hours. Go and play 45 minutes. Get some maximum bets down. Try not to get too much attention. Come back eight hours later, do the same thing. Biloxi is pretty good down here. Nice weather, a little pool time in at the Beau Rivage. I won 7,700 at the Hard Rock and then I won 11,800 at Beau Rivage in about ten minutes. These double dead games are so juicy that it's actually worth it to go in and just play for 15 minutes spreading, you know, you can probably make-- the way I'm spreading, you can probably make about 2,000 an hour, playing those games. Three days and 26,000, two 28. Yeah like what you created huh? My background in gaming? I grew up my father was a games player. He was a serious backgammon player, poker player, blackjack player, and he was an innovator in these fields. He took the game very seriously. he played it in a time when very few people knew how to count cards. Ah, this is 1960, 61'-62'. There were no resources available but no history of blackjack is complete without mentioning John Scarne, who was the first person to my knowledge, to ever make a public statement that blackjack was a game that could be beaten. I remember getting on the bus and going to Reno before he was 18 years old. I had developed my own counting method based on what I think at the time was actually the first point count, ever used in a casino. And using the crude basic strategy I learned from John Scarne's work, I found myself winning. And we gambled around the world in blackjack, backgammon, play blackjack in casinos in Biarritz, in @@, in Monte Carlo. So as a child I was able to see some of his adventures playing, traveling to tournaments, traveling to Las Vegas, playing and it certainly influenced me. By the time he was growing up, he'd see it occasionally. But not on a several hours a day basis, the way I was engaged in my youth. I was kind of surprised really that the he took it up and got into it to the degree he did, but maybe it's genetic. We are in Greenville, Mississippi. These places are great because they're so small, they don't really belong to a big-- where the hell am I? They're so small I don't know where the hell they are. They have very unsophisticated surveillance. I was able to shuffle track which added doubled my advantage rating more. Shuffle tracking is a great technique used to take advantage of weak shuffles, can enhance the card counting experience and increase your advantage with less heat than card counting alone. As I count the shoe, I notice a lot of tens and aces grouped together in the first deck dealt. I mentally labeled this group of cards or slug in the discard tray. As I continue to count the shoe, I noticed the consistency of the remainder of the shoe. After counting the entire six-deck shoe, I'm able to follow the interesting slugs through a weak, one pass shuffle. Notice the two slugs with negative counts of minus 16 and minus eight will be shuffled together to form a two-deck slug with a running count of minus 24. The new group of cards is presented at the front of the shoe after the shuffle and I want to target this slug. I cut a small group of cards from the back of the shoot forward noted in green. I'll play through the green group of cards at minimum bets until I reach the red target slug. With a true count of plus 12 and an advantage over 5%, I will increase my bets to the table maximum, until I play through the entire slug. Once you begin to include techniques beyond counting in your repertoire, it makes it more difficult for casino surveillance operators to analyze your play. So it was great, a couple thousand here, a couple there. It adds up. I just went into Sam's Town to play. They had a great single-deck game I was playing, very small, trying not to get any attention. Casino's shift manager approached me along with head of security, another security guard, they were rude and unpleasant, told me to color up, I was being trespassed from the property. I was very calm and friendly with them. They kind of escorted me towards the door and I said, "Listen, I've got these chips. Where's the cashier?" The casino shift manager told me the cashier was in the parking lot, that I had to leave right now. "If you come back, we'll arrest you." So I'm meeting with agents from the Mississippi Gaming Commission, it's unlawful for them to kick you out when they know you have chips and tell you that you cannot cash the chips. That's equivalent to stealing. The gaming agent walked me in today, and cashed them with me. He walked into the casino with me so that I could cash them. They might get a fine. They're going to get some sort of violation. You have to fight this, this web of surveillance and counter surveillance to try and get your bets down. All you want is walk into a casino and play and use your mind ike anybody else but there's a whole web that you can get caught in, once they find you, they're going to kick you out. Despite the usual dramas and challenges you face while you're playing blackjack professionally, such as getting kicked out and a heat, I'm having a blast. Enjoying my time in the RV, the freedom, being on the road, had a great winning streak in the south and now I'm ready to head west. I'm going to stop in Vegas for a couple of days and then head to California. There's 40 or 50 casinos I haven't even been to. I'm looking forward to that and I'm just excited right now. We're back on the road, heading west to California. Yeah I started Golden Acorn last night, Indian casino in San Diego area. Once we arrived, there were only two tables open at a six-deck game with a maximum bet of 500 and a two-deck game with a maximum bet of 250. I ended up winning under 2,000 there. Then we drove to Viejas casino, walk in there and had two amazing shoes back to back, sky-high counts. It happened so fast as he would go press, press, press. Next thing I knew I was at maximum bets. And I won over 10,500 in probably about half an hour. And now we drove to Barona. 'm going to play here today, it's most high-end casino in the San Diego area. How are you today? Quick session in Barona, they had no problem with me winning 5,000. A little bit of cover play went a long way. For sure the hat and glasses I was wearing were a must because they practically advertise on the table they use facial recognition. I've never seen it. Biometrica is a software company that came into being, specifically, to provide game protection software to casinos. They have people they'd like to keep track of. Good guys, bad guys, high rollers, advantage players, cheaters. Here's a new guy in our casino. We checked our databases, we don't know who he is. He's winning a heck of a lot of money. They grab your picture, click, with the touch of a mouse it can go up and out to 175 little surveillance rooms. The camera will freeze an image and instantly check all the pictures in the database and come up with the most likely matches. The best way to think of it is in terms of, we grab an image of your face, as soon as you grab that, the software measures your face, maybe 1,000 different measurements. So it's important to understand that we use the eyes just as anchor points to start the measurements all around. There's so many measurements there. If you put it on a mustache or you put on a beard, you covered up, what, 15% of your measurements? I mean you could go through a makeup artist and come into a casino dressed as Tootsie instead of Dustin Hoffman, then you probably won't be seen. It's unlikely that somebody's going to have so much on them. If they do what's going to happen is they're not going to need face recognition "Look at this guy." They attracted more attention to themselves than our software ever could. I got to scout it out and figure out what her shift is and how she moves around. It's a 12 o'clock, it's 12:30. I don't know if I may caught the very end of her shift. All right. Well, I'll keep you posted. Bye-bye. Well I just hit a quick session at Pechanga, San Diego, and stumbled across an incredible opportunity. I came across a dealer who unbeknownst to her, would show me her hole card every single hand. The game is such a slam-dunk where this could be easily, a six-figure opportunity. Hole carding means that the dealer is exposing their hole card in blackjack. Normally, that's supposed to be dealt face down but sometimes the way the dealer takes it out of the shoe or the way they check for the blackjack, some sort of mannerism that they have the player might be able to see it. Hole card play is one of the best things that they could do nowadays I believe. Anytime you're in a card game, you know the value or even some partial information about what a hidden card is likely to be then you could adjust your strategies accordingly to get a much bigger edge than you would have through counting cards. Approximately one to two percent of dealers use poor or sloppy techniques which can be exploited by advantage players. This dealer is unknowingly flashing his hole card. Given the extra information I adjust my playing strategy accordingly. On my first hand I have a nine, would normally hit against a 10 but given the extra information that the hole card is the six of clubs, I changed my play and double down. The hole card information provides an advantage of about ten percent. So, I flat bet the table maximum, every hand. On my second hand I have 14. I would normally hit 14 against a 10, but I'm playing my 14 against the dealer's 16 and opt to stand according to the hole card strategy. The erratic plays combined with consistent bet amounts make the technique more difficult for casino operators to detect. We read up and we consult with attorneys and find out before we even play is this something we can do legally? And since it is, we have no qualms. Just you know hitting that game and others as hard as we could. My last session with Pechanga went really well. I played an eight-hour shift, on graveyard um... with my favorite dealer who happens to show me her hole card almost every hand. I followed her around, figured out her table rotation and when she would be there. I play a little bit before she rotate in and after, it went really well. I did get a fair amount of heat. They knew I wasn't counting they couldn't figure out what was going on. Ninety-five thousand eight hundred, I think for a total of six days of play, not bad at all. I started out strong in Mississippi, in Louisiana, with a series of big wins. The winning continued in San Diego, followed by a six-figure hole card score. This trip really couldn't have started better. I'm up already over 250,000 dollars. I pulled in Palm Springs last night to Morongo, crushed them, won over 20,000. He drove down further into Palm Springs to Fantasy Springs at which point I took off my sports coat and my jacket and my nice outfit and put on a wig and some camo, pad and changing into black shirt and shorts. Then I headed on deeper into Palm Springs, went to Spa, had a quick clobbered beating up for 5,500 and got some heat. As soon as I raised my bet they came over and booted me. Said that-- told me I was a known advantage player. You know we're getting deep, went around dirt roads, and you have no cell phone reception. This casino over the trip because we're so far out in the boonies. I started playing, another gentleman sat down, he was playing five dollars a hand. And another kid came up and had four one-dollar chips. I went on a bit of a hot streak, cleaned out their whole rack. We got a lot of attention. I mean a 1,500 dollar bet in Vegas term isn't very big. But out on a place like this you know, created quite a crowd. We've landed in Reno. I've got my list, I planned out my route of all the casinos I want to hit. I'm looking at about 15 to 20 casinos I want to play. They've been hit hard over the years by a lot of card counters and teams of professionals. It's pretty hard to get down some big bets. Does the casino have a right to demand identification and have it produced? The answer is no. The casinos are always trying to get your ID. They want you to have a player's card. So, security guards will say, "You know, it's illegal not to have ID." Complete horseshit. It's this simple. It's a lie. It's a lie. Let's see if I can think of another way to say it? It's untrue. Okay. There is nothing in God's green earth that says you have to have papers, anywhere, in the United States merely to be there. If you get in or cash out more than 10,000 dollars in cash, then you do have to show ID, they have to file this form called a cash transaction report. Everybody knows what to do if you're over 10,000. But when you're sort of above 3,000 they typically, internally ask for an ID for their own internal records. But they're not legally obligated to get an ID, nobody really knows how to handle those transactions. Normally, they're not supposed to ask for your ID unless they're charging you with a crime. But if they're smart, they'll say wait, we're just trying to keep track to make sure you because we may have to file a currency transaction report. Now, they cash out 8,250 for me without an ID. But they basically told me, they wanted to file a suspicious activity report. They tried to ask me for my name for that report. I didn't give it. But yeah, it's like drugs. When they want your ID, just say no. I've now been kicked out on nearly every shift from every casino. I feel I've done a good job extracting value from the city. I'm actually probably right about expectation for the amount I've played. I got logged in a lot of hours. We are in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The heat is through the roof. I'm going to get one more session in, then we're out of here. The good news is Reno, Tahoe, has been a pretty good area. I am up about 35,000 after 11 days of play in Reno. Tahoe's been a bit of a grind, but I've gotten a lot of hands in here, came out ahead. So, I'm feeling good having won in each area and they never got my ID. This like one of the best blackjack games I've seen in a long, long time. I was only planning to stop by it might be a one session place. I'm so surprised by the conditions, it's juicy. They don't seem to give a shit who I am. They don't belong to Griffin or anything like that. They don't use any facial recognition software and they don't seem to mind that I'm spreading from the minimum to the maximum, ideal situation. For the day I am down 30-- just under 50,000. I'm going to take a little break, run a simulation on the game just to make sure my numbers are all up to date. This is like the needle in the haystack to play here, then to take a big loss. I'm going to have to play 20 more casinos to try to win it back. That's the benefit of betting bigger. If you have a big win, it takes you to the next level. Big loss, you really have to grind and grind to get your money back. Blackjack players understand the concept of risk. They understand the fact that there are going to be fluctuations, ups and downs, but they want to control the risks. People ask me, "What's different about new card counters that you can make this work?" And it's a really interesting question. I think we're all pretty wacky. We have niches where we get really good at doing simple math under pressure. There's no gut feeling, there's no I just busted three hands in a row, there is an exact right play and a wrong play. Other people will analyze a situation and think, "Oh my god, I don't want this outcome and I know that outcome is possible. So, I won't do that." And we analyze that situation and we say, "Well, if I did that a million times. How many times would that outcome happen? how many times would the other?" It's a really different way of looking at the world. I went back, ended up playing a marathon and graveyard shift of nine and a half hours. I bought it for 5,000. I lost 2,500. I was down by about down to 2,500 left. I ran 2500 and 70,000. So, we just got escorted out by Bear River security. Unlike recent security escorts this one was quite a bit more friendly. They gave us a courtesy escort all the way to the RV because we cashed out so much at the casino cage. It's so pretty up here. It's a beautiful drive. We're up in the northwest corner of California, Humboldt County. Quite a few little Indian casinos scattered around here. I've never played in this area of the country. So I didn't really know what to expect and I've stumbled across a couple of really good games. We were going to come up the west coast of California into Oregon, up to Seattle before we go east. I really enjoyed the Northwest. It's beautiful up here and I keep stringing together wins. So, I'm feeling good about my play. Unfortunately, I am getting a little bit lonely. I think two to three months here in the RV is starting to take its toll on me. I thought maybe with the excitement of travel and the wins and losses that go along with playing, I'd be fine. But I am getting a little bit lonely and I think a good cure for that would be picking up my dogs in the Bay Area. I'm going to drive down to San Francisco, load up the dogs, bring them along for the rest of the trip. Hit the Thunder Valley this weekend. Should have a pretty good session there in terms of the ability to bet big this weekend and then work my way to the Midwest. The Mohawk and the outfit definitely helped a lot. Booked a small win just under 5,000 but opted to call it a night. Friday night's a bit busier. There's more action. The place was kind of dead. I don't want to get burned tonight and thrown out betting 2,000 when I could bet 10,000. Hi, I just had the casino steal my personal property in the amount of almost 40,000. No. they surrounded me with security, they trespassed me, I was in the parking lot in my RV, trying to get a hold of the sheriff. They started giving me a hard time saying, I wasn't leaving. I was leaving, I'm trying to call the police to handle it myself. I'm about three blocks away from the casino I just left. All right. They're going to have a deputy come here. So, you know, the sheriff went in there was sympathetic to me and said, "I'll help you go get your chips." They were doing everything they could just to be as difficult as possible. You got to leave the property. I'm not going to give you whole lot of time. Or we can go to county jail. It's a 130 miles that way. They just gave me a real hard time. I didn't even play a hand. I just bought in and they were just real nasty. Salt Lake City. We're in an area that is completely isolated from any casinos. Just driving across the country. Made it to Nebraska. It's been a long night. Done about five-hundred-something-mile drive so far. We are in Iowa. I played a few sessions. I had session at Ameristar, a couple of sessions at Horseshoe and I am just in the middle of a tailspin losing streak. Fifteen thousand last night, 10,000 yesterday, eighteen thousand the day before that. From a mathematical perspective, it's not that big of a deal. But it's not always easy to detach yourself emotionally from it. Just had a very bad experience at Harrah's. Tried to get me into a back security room but they couldn't give me a reason why. We're leaving the Iowa area. I've been asked not to play at Ameristar and I've been trespassed from the Horseshoe and Harrah's. This was pretty much a losing city for me. After five days battling these three casinos in St. Louis just feeling a bit frustrated. I'm down 3,000. I feel like in five days I've logged in over 40 hours of play, got a head, lost it, got behind ten-fifteen thousand, won it all back, got down again. It's really just been a grind. I'm heading through Northern Iowa. We had one casino on our list. Unfortunately, I used a casino guide book from last year. Showed up and the casino had been turned into a theater. They must have gone bankrupt in the last six months. Either way, it's actually good to have a night off. I've played already three, if not four casinos today and I'm freaking losing like crazy. Sit back, take it easy, have a couple of beers, watch a movie, lick my wounds, move on and it sucks. I've been on this blackjack train for so long, I felt like I might as well ride it to the end of the station. When you put in that time and effort and get the RV travelling around, have the bankroll, deal with all the stress of getting kicked out and treated like a criminal, you end up losing 100,000, that's brutal. I don't think a lot of people in the world could deal with working two months, ten hours a day and end up losing money, there aren't that many jobs you can do that. But if you want to be a professional blackjack player, play every day for years, five years say, this is what I'm going to do. Traveling around the country, play at every single casino, you can bet your ass you're going to go a two-month period and you're going to be down. Playing our route through the Midwest. Basically the whole Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, not a lot of good casinos but a lot of places worth peeking into. I like coming to these out-of-the-way places usually you could find good games. They tend to be less networked with other casinos. So it's easier for me to get some action. Majestic Pines Casino, Black River Falls, Wisconsin. I lost 1,000 bucks which again is not a big deal in terms of absolute value of the loss but I went to two hands at 50 and I lost eight of them in a row. It's just brutal. For safety reasons, I only travel with a portion of my bankroll which is fine unless I go through a sustained losing stretch which I've done. So today, I flew from O'Hare to Las Vegas, picked up 200,000 and flew back two hours later. There's nothing illegal about carrying large amounts of money domestically. You can cross state lines and there's no problem. The only thing that happens is people tend to freak out when they see a lot of cash, they report it to various agencies. They immediately think if you have more than 10,000 in cash, you're a drug dealer or you're doing something illegal. I can put 200,000 on me and I feel pretty comfortable. I don't feel like I'm bulging. I don't feel like people are looking at me or anything's funny. Joliet, Illinois. Didn't even get in there. I got right to the gate of the boat and security said, "We just got a call. We're expecting you. I can't let you in." I've had a good run and play all the way through from Chicago, and we played four east of Chicago and Indiana. Played all over Indiana. The casinos have been very close together they communicate and take a lot of photos of me. Various casinos have taken down license plate and description of the RV. I walked in, they had a file of probably 12 different photos of me, all from the last week. So, it's getting a little tricky right now. Stepping out of the realm of state-regulated casinos that are not Indian related and on to a reservation casino can be as different as deciding that you want to have dinner in downtown Las Vegas or dinner in Liberia. The tribes of the United States are considered domestic nations. They have the rights of sovereign governments, similar to the states to some extent even greater than the state. They have you tied up hook, line, and sinker and can do their will upon you, physically and financially. Bad place to be. Other casinos can do that too, but you have civil recourse. A difference with the Indian casino is the threat of recourse isn't there, so they might feel much more free to do it. You have about the same amount of rights that a U.S. citizen would have in Mexico. The heat is so high right now that each casino is notifying the other casinos in the area. Griffin's on to us. I think the only solution right now is to break our trail. So rather than following our route up through northern Michigan and Canada, I think that we need to probably just break off, do a long driving session, move a couple of states over. After traveling across five states, I showed up in New York at Turning Stone. I booked a small win, I was able to log in a multi-hour session which meant that they weren't expecting me. Just played my second big session in the Connecticut area, I'm going to go play another graveyard session tonight and play a little smaller. Try and stay out of the radar and book a small win, basically to regain my confidence. And grind out a little bit of more EV. Travel is a big part of the game. Moving around constantly and it's an aspect of the game that it makes it difficult for some people. At first the travel can be fun, but sometimes the travel was very grueling. You know, constantly being on the road. We just had a minor disaster. The RV broke down in the Mohegan Sun. We're having trouble finding someone that can come out and fix it. And towing this thing is a nightmare. To make matters worse, the bankroll is secured and unlocks at a place that you can only get to when the car was on. We did finally find a guy--a mobile truck service that could come out. As I suspected, the starter went bad. One of the amazing things about KC, as far as I'm aware, he's a lone wolf. That's a tough road. You can't really specialize, you have to be a master of everything or a jack-of-all-trades at least. To survive as a lone wolf is very rare. Basically, Connecticut was a disaster, a 100,000 dollar downswing. I come to Atlantic City, drop down my bets a bit, only to have a really bad first night here. New Jersey has said that card counting is legal and that the casinos cannot exclude card counters. There's no regulation saying they can kick them out, but they do have these horrible regulations such as changing the stakes for a single person at a table. Pretty rough day today, played three sessions, had three 10,000 dollar losses back-to-back-to-back. As of this morning, around noon, I was up 20,000. I lost that back, plus, another 30,000 for a 50,000 dollar downturn, plus 8,000 that I lost last night. This blackjack trip for me is like a company, a business that I am running. I need a place get as many of these bets in and create as much expected value. Along the way I have to deal with a fluctuations which is the risk and I don't want to end up tapping out at any point, going bankrupt. When you start losing, you need to buckle down and grind it back out. And you just have to let go, you know. You get your bets in then the cards fall as they may. And you just really have to hope that you can ride out the storm. So, right now, this is all about riding out the storm. By far the most important characteristic of someone who is going to be a success at this is emotional control. You can't be subject to emotional involvement that will take your losses and turn them into your downfall. Trying to fill up with the Flying J. We're out of propane. It's been a rough two nights Ran out of propane and it's been freezing in Atlantic City. Spent two nights shivering with the dogs. I wrapped them up in a blanket using to keep me warm. The good news is we're heading south. Hopefully, it's going to get warmer from here. It's nice to be in Florida. The weather's a bit better. The losing seems to have slowed down a bit. I'm starting to log in a couple of winning sessions, playing in the Tampa-Miami Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood area. I'm going to jump on a plane and hop over to the Bahamas. Check out the Atlantis. They get some decent action there, should be a good spot. Just arrived at Atlantis Casino and Resort, played my first session at the casino, went straight in, played 14,500. Last 24 hours in the Bahamas has just been awesome. Got some pool time, some R&R, I have been able to get solid table max bets without ever even disclosing my ID. They've got a table up by the pool. I've been able to get a deep afternoon session in. I had a great situation last night in a shoe game, a few aces came out and I was able to shuffle track a sequence and it worked out perfectly. I basically got three aces in a row. They all landed on my hand, I won all three hands at maximum bet. That was fantastic. Sequencing is an advantage play technique which involves following a string or sequence of cards. Keep in mind that aces are very valuable to the player in the game of blackjack. A player has a 53% advantage when dealt an ace as his first card. In this example a sequence of three consecutive aces is observed. Location of aces are mentally noted in the discard tray. In the following hand a sequence of key cards are observed and memorized. These cards will precede the aces in the following shoe. In this example the key cards in order are the nine of diamonds, Jack of Diamonds, King of Diamonds and seven of Spades. While the cards will get shuffled the sequence gets shuffle tracked and cut to the front of the shoe. After the first three key cards appear in order, the bet is raised to table max in anticipation of the arrival of the ace sequence. The three aces shortly follow an order. Sequencing is a powerful technique when the opportunity presents itself. There's very little heat as few casinos have the ability to detect this method. After getting up 600,000 I've had a dreadful winter, playing every day for three months. I've given back over 300,000. Finally, I've strung together six wins in a row, including a 77,000 dollar win in the Bahamas I feel like things are starting to turn for the better. We're basically on the home stretch of this giant circle we've done around the country. I just got off the phone with my dad, I piqued my dad's interest talking to him over the last year and a half. And he told me today that he's going to join us through New Mexico and Arizona. It's going to be fun for me to pull him out of retirement and have a little bit of camaraderie. - Good to see you. - Yeah. We are on Albuquerque - ready to start our adventure. - Are you ready for some work? - All right, let's do it. - All right. Yeah, it's fun having my dad in the RV. You know... he lives in California. I live in Las Vegas. I've been on the road a lot. It's good for us to spend time together. You can write down the stakes in advance. - All right. That's not fair. - Go ahead. No, you've lost your score keeping and I'm keeping score now and driving. You can't do that. So when we're together, it's just non-stop games, non-stop competition. All right. The next alphabetical state, Indiana. Stop writing it down. I'm not supposed to write your answer down? Do you challenge me? Yeah, my dad and I are very competitive. You know he has been a professional games player for a large portion of his life and has this competitive spirit which I probably inherited. We were playing a state game and we just found evidence that there was a little bit of foul play going on here, but he was busted. He used the score-- the privileges. The competition got out of control to the point where he's accusing me of stuff, I am accusing him of stuff, it got so heated that we had to quit the game in the middle. It's double after split we split aces, six-deck game, shoe... We cut off a deck and a half. This isn't his idea of finding in the airport getting picked up by a limo, playing golf going out to nice dinners. We're grinding it in an RV, driving across the desert, places with 500 dollar maximum bet. So it's not really glorious here. Dad, we need a signal, we're going to be playing these shoe games If you get a count that's good, I want to know, so I can come and play. If you can do a call in it's okay if you don't know the count, you can come in betting big. That's classic team theory, but most casinos have seen that so it's not some original idea anymore. The man that invented team play is Frank. - Yeah. We call him Al Francesco. - Yeah. My name is-- I have three names. In the blackjack world, it's Al Francesco. My original, real name is Frank Schipani. My legal name is Frank Salerno. Yeah, the people in a blackjack world understand why we have different names. He was the guy that years ago before when I was still in grade school he went into the casinos in Las Vegas and just watched what people do. Where do people put their hands? What do they do with them? And he made up these signals that were the basis of team play and these signals that many which we still use today. Put your hand into your hair, but like you were there playing yesterday. - Mm-hmm - But if the count is good go up. My hand will either be on my on my chin or if my chin means nothing. If I'm like this at the table but if my fingers are touching my hair - at all it's a good situation. - Alright. I really like this area. I haven't really done any in-depth play in the New Mexico region and I'm finding some really good games. - That's a good game. - I was getting some heat, well not heat, but he was watching me. You've establish yourself as-- You were talking about he's hitting 13 against fives and sixes and standing on 15 against sevens and eights and you get up from him and, "Hey, I played horribly," the woman was just, "Yeah, I mean he was just awful." And they're talking to the pit-boss and the dealer that way, it was funny. - That's what they said about me after I left? - Yeah. It's a good game. Their dealing is five decks. I think you should go back in there and punish them. All right. We're continuing through Arizona. I've got my father with me we're playing at Camp Verde at Cliff Castle. And I had a solid, two or three decks I got to play with in a really high count situation This winner was the worst losing streak I'd ever sustained. I played every day for three months and was down over 325,000 dollars. I've been able to maintain the momentum I had in the south and the Bahamas and Florida through Arizona, New Mexico and have recovered about 60 to 70 percent of that back. That was quite a shoe. The shoe after was better. - What? - My very last shoe. Here you go. Finished it. The finish I was looking for. Blackjack I think has probably ran its course. But then if you look at it, it's been going around since 60s. So how much farther is the course going to go? Back in 2000 I was at a gaming conference and I ran into Arnold Snyder and we got talking. I said, "Arnold, I think blackjack is going to be history as being attackable in five years." Well, it was 2005, so, obviously, I was wrong. The blackjack players are smarter than the casino operators, fact of life. Those guys are watching somebody else's money. We're playing our own. While the casinos are sleeping and those guys are at home, we're thinking. There's always a new move coming along. Right now people in blackjack are making as much money as they made five years ago, ten years ago, 20 years ago. There's always something else out there. Not just card counting, there's always going to be something. I think the future of advantage play is very bright. The people that adapt continue to make money and still make money to this day. Every year somebody tells me blackjack is dead and every year advantage play has just gotten better and better and better. I don't see in the reasonable, foreseeable future that blackjack is going to be dead to any of us. For us the clock never stops working, you know, working all the time. And so the game goes on. Coming back to Las Vegas, I'm exhausted. The last 12 months I spent grinding in casinos, working in a hostile environment, it took its toll on me, the wins, the losses. I'm glad this chapter of my career was profitable. Oh he's taken things that I did and gone to the next level with them. He's ambitious and he's done very well. And has no reason not to be successful, but I hope he realizes that there are better things to do in the long term with his life. But I think it should form a good basis, some good experience, things will carry over in no matter what he does. It really makes no difference where KC ends up. The skills that he's learned from blackjack, where does that lead? Only the future will tell. People in life, who are going to be successful as his dad was and KC is very much like his father that way. I still like the rush of beating a casino, but for me the game has changed. I'm no longer, you know, a welcomed high roller. I'm now trying to fly under the radar having to work really hard just to play. And it's tough. It's a super grind. It's not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. I am thankful that I had this experience. I am thankful that I've got skills I should hopefully be able to take to a new phase of my life. And I don't know what the next step is but it's become clear to me at this point that professional Blackjack is behind me. Hey, Stevie! What's up? It's KC just checking in. I just got a call from my dad. He's down in Florida, was playing golf and came across a hole card game. He said it might be a six-figure opportunity. So I'm jumping on the next plane and heading down there. Hope all is well with you. Give me a ring.
