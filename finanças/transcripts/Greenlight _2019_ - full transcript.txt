We could have made great partners, Jackson! It is way too fucking late for that, Serg. Just know that if you kill her, you join her. You little crooked snake, cost me everything! I know! But if you just walk away from my sister, you walk away rich. Take this money You will never see either of us again. You think this is about money? I do not need money. I need vengeance. Oh no, no! No! Do you mind if I eat? What? Do you mind if I eat? Oh, yeah. No, go ahead yeah, sure. Of course. So, it is a straight western. We are not really looking for that sort of thing right now. Well it does not have to be. Um. It could turn into a horror film. Actually, we do not do horror. But I thought you guys just did a horror film. That was different. It was elevated. Look, I like your short films. We are really looking to hire directors with more experience. The girl coming in after you. Two low budget films. Countless shorts, web series. Music videos. What do I have to do to get hired to direct a feature? Unfortunately, no one is going to give you a feature until you have made a feature. So, why did you waste my god damn time today you fucking robot?! That is what I should have said. At least you made the connection. You never know. It might pay off. I just really thought this one was gonna be different. I do not know why. They do not deserve you. It just means that something even better is coming soon. On to the next. Where you going? To try and make a movie. How is it going? You know if I wanted to be an unpaid intern or if I was a hot girl. Or if I was a hot girl that wanted to be an unpaid intern, then I would really be in business, babe. Wow, great, where do I sign up. Hmph. You have got a career already. Not yet, what if everyone hates it? They will not. You know why? Why? Because you are incredibly talented and you are charming. And you are fucking gorgeous! Oh! Like JK Rowling. Yeah. True. But hey if I have a career, you have a career. Oh, you are gonna carry all my dead weight, huh? No. You gonna be my sugar mama? No. I will be your teammate. We will support each other. Especially through the hard times, which is right now. I just think you are so much more talented than me. I believe that too, it is... You are a fighter. You have more drive than anybody I know. And one day that fight is gonna be given an opportunity. And when that opportunity arises. Yeah? Ok get it. Fine, ok. I am sorry. No, it is fine. That is not the opportunity I was hoping for. No, but your luck is already changing. Ooh! Mmm! Action. Cut. Cutting. Moving on. Thank you. Did you get the shot? It was in focus and looked sexy as fuck. My job is done. Horns coming through. Where have I seen her before? Um, she is in like a lot of low budget stuff. She is alright. She just needs to be in some better films. Yeah, no shit. Why is she on this? Pretty girls have bills too, man. She knows this producer guy who is looking for a director. You should talk to her. Oh yeah I am sure she would be real interested in me. So are you officially like my agent now? Is this cause you just got that Franco thing? I am just saying. Give it a try. You have changed, man. I like your work. Guarding traffic cones? Sam showed me one of your shorts. You are really good. I am Sarah by the way. Jack, thanks. Appreciate it. Why are you PA'ing? I do not know. Typical cliches I guess. I do not have any money and need work and no one will let me make a movie until I make a movie. So, what about you? I mean, no offense but this seems a little beneath you. Beneath me? I am an actress. I need work, to be seen, meet young directors like you that will hopefully hire me down the road. All good points. I actually know somebody looking for a director. It is low budget but I could pass your info along if you are interested. Sure, yeah. I cannot guarantee anything. Yeah, no, of course. Do you have a card? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Do not be nervous. It is your parents so I think I will always be nervous. I know they have been hard on you in the past but it is gonna be an hour long dinner and then we do not have to see them again for another two months. It is gonna be fine. It is gonna be fine. Oh God, that is awful. What? I am gonna have to call Alvaro at the Whole Foods. This is unacceptable. No, no, no, no, no. It is great. It is the best meal I have had in a long time actually. There is a difference between flattery and lying, Jack. Are you a liar? Dad, he is just starving. He just got home from work. Be nice. Okay, okay. Ok. Ok, so uh, so what are you working on now? I was just a production assistant on a shoot for a friend. Like an intern? Well-- Actually Jack just produced a film and I was going to talk to my publisher about letting Jack write the screenplay to my book. Oh, I thought you were gonna get somebody good like Oliver Stone. Oh no, that is, that is a dream. No, this would be a really good opportunity for Jack though. So you are producing? Mmhmm. Well that is just wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So tell me, how does one make money off of a short film? You do not, really. You just hope it launches you into a feature. That is a real movie, honey. Yeah a feature is a full length film so, first you have to get the money to make it. Then you shoot it, edit it, score, VFX. Then you try to find a distributor with or without a film festival to negotiate the deal. And then just wait for it to come out, for the release but actually, after the release you wait a couple of months until the distributor makes their money back and then hopefully you have something come in, so. Hopefully by then we have enough money for like a gym membership or something. So you're a bum? Dad. Look, I am just calling it the way I see it, honey. I mean, you wrote a novel while in college. Freshman year. This boy you are seeing is going to soil your accomplishments just because he is looking for another handout. Dad, I would be lucky if Jack wrote the screenplay for my book. You do not know what you are talking about-- Shantel, it is fine. It is not fine. He has not earned anything. I am sorry. And he has no manners. I have got to take it, I am sorry. It could be for work. It is fine. Ok. Go get you. Ok? Hello? Yeah, this is him. Oh, hi. He is smart. He is funny and he loves me. He makes me feel good about myself. I love, I love this boy. And we are paying this boys rent for the last two months. As far as I am concerned, he is not working on anything that is continuing to his life. I am sorry. Um... I just got a phone call about having a meeting tomorrow about potentially directing a real movie. What? So if you will excuse me, I gotta go home and prepare. Do you want to stay? No. No, I am going with you. Thank you for dinner, mom and dad. And since it is such a burden that you have to pay for our rent, I will be paying for our rent from now on. Really, thank you so much for dinner. Thank you. Hello? Jack Archer? Yes sir. You want a drink? No thanks. But thank you so much for meeting with me, Mr. Moseby. I am a huge fan of your work. Call me Bob. And my movies are shit. No use kissing my ass, kid. Ok, Bob then. Um but really, honestly I do really like some of them, I mean the production value is a little low but there are some really good ideas in there. Well I agree. Have a seat. So why am I here? I do not know yet. Tell me about yourself, Jack. Sure yea, um so, I graduated top ten UFI and then I interned under Mark Karkoska- Stop. I know how to use Google, man. I know you are top ten. I also know it was a class of twenty-five. I have seen your shorts. You are good. What I want to know is, where do you want to go? I want to make a feature. I have what it takes. I just want to prove it. Ok and what experience you got with features? Thank you so much for meeting with me. This has been great. I know how this goes. Down. Really? You are just gonna fold up like that? That quick, no fight at all? That is kind of a pussy move, is it not? Um, sure, ok. Uh, I have made a couple shorts and I have written a few movies but I cannot get hired to direct a feature until I direct a feature. And I cannot direct a feature because I cannot make a feature because I do not have the money to make a feature and I do not make any money when I am doing stupid production jobs and uh I cannot even get a bank loan because I have hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt so I should probably just kill myself, right? Come here. Come here, come here. I am not gonna hurt you. Ow. Sorry, I lied. That was bugging the shit out of me. No, it is cool. Um... I am sorry. This is all I know. I just want to make movies. And I am not looking for a handout. I will literally work every single day for the rest of my life if one person just gives me an opportunity to make a movie. Just one person. I was born for this. Come with me. Beautiful, is it not? It is the only place where it is ok to scream, bleed and die for your art. If the cinema is the church, this is the seminary. I want you to direct my next movie, Jack. Jack? Jack. Yeah? You with me? Sorry. I feel like I just got shot. Feels good, does it not? Yeah it feels really good actually. There is going to be a lot more of that this year if you say yes. What is the movie? The Sleep Experiment. Jesus. Check it out. Woh, this is big. Yeah, it needs a trim. What is the story? It is a psychological thriller. It is about a sleep experiment that goes awry and uh... Shit. The subjects start to question reality and start killing each other off to survive the experiment. So it is a horror? Psychological thriller if you want to win awards. Hey but that is what it is right now. It could be whatever you want, it is your baby. I do not really know what to say. Well a smart man would ask more questions. I will give you three. Ok, what is the budget? Oh, right to the money, good man. Not much, half a million but I will be flexible on that if I like the dailies. Alright, um uh, why this script because you know I write too. I have a bunch of scripts. Yeah, we all do. That is the picture. I have already pre-sold half the foreign rights and I have already got a cast together and we built a set. Now that is the movie I have to make. Look, the director I had got cold feet. He dropped out. This is your moment, man. This is your Piranha two. Yeah but better. You got one more question. Why me? Honestly Jack, because you will work twice as hard as a veteran director for half the pay. Hey, and you are damn good, Jack. When does it shoot? Three weeks. If you have any revisions you would like to make, I am going to need a final draft by Friday. But I can get the cast together for you as early as tomorrow morning. Three weeks. You scared? No, I am ready. Alright. Let us do this. Can we do this? Let us do it. Oh, I am sorry, I gotta do it. I gotta do it. Sorry. God! Man, thank you so much. You are welcome. Let us celebrate. Yeah, where is the champagne? This is the champagne, kid. What is that? This is a tradition. What kind of tradition? The kind you shoot before a shoot. Uh, I was not serious about blowing my brains out earlier you know. Nice, is it not? Look, everyone I do business with gives her a bang. I have never even shot a gun before. Never shot a feature either. See those sandbags? I do. Alright then flick off the safety, line up the sights and pull the trigger. In here, really? Well yeah, Jack. It is my building, soundproofed as hell. Go ahead, come on. Go ahead and fire one off and seal the deal on your first fucking film. Do it. There you go. Alright. Ladies and gentlemen, the kid is a god damn natural! Put that away before you kill me. Yeah. Welcome aboard. Thank you. Hey, babe. Wake up. Guess what? Hey, how was your meeting? Oh it was pretty good. Yeah? Yeah, I am making a movie. Like I am actually making a movie. He saw my short films and he just handed me the script and he asked me to direct his movie. Look, it is not what I pictured for my first feature but it is real and it is an opportunity and I took it and we shoot in three weeks. Babe, oh my God. I am so proud of you. I am so proud of you. God, you deserve this. I am just trying to process this. What do you think about the hat? I do not like it. Is it too much? Yeah. I just feel like every director wears a hat. I do not like it. Ok. Oh God, look at me. Look at me. Ok, you look good. You look good. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Everyone, welcome. How are you? I am good, you must be Nancy. I am and you are Jack. Yeah, nice to meet you. It is a pleasure to meet you. Bob has had so many wonderful things to say about you. He says you are a young Brian De Palma. Oh, I do not know about that but thank you. Thank you. I believe it and I cannot wait to give you a great performance in this amazing film. Me too. Thank you so much. Welcome. Hey brother. Hey, how are you? I am Damien. I am so fucking excited! This movie means the world to me. I will not let you down! I will help with catering, carry lights, whatever you need. We are making a fucking movie! Alright, man. Yeah, love it. Welcome, welcome. Fancy seeing you here. The world cannot be this small, can it? I told you I knew someone that needed a director. I have you to thank for this? Just give me a few closeups and a couple extra lines and we will call it even? You got it. Ok, I have to go now. Did you say hi to everyone? Oh yeah no. Briefly. We met. They look great. You guys look great. Are you ok? Yeah I am just excited. Ok. Ok. Wish me luck. Ok, good luck. Bye. Thank you so much for coming first of all. I just wanted to tell you how excited I am to work with all of you. As you probably know, this is my first feature so I just want to assure you that I am gonna bring everything I have to this. I am gonna make it as good as I possibly can but I know that I cannot do that alone so from now on this is our movie. Feel totally free just to come to me with anything you have. Any questions, ideas because from now on, we are gonna be a family on this so, thank you. That is wonderful, Jack. Thank you. Ok, so uh first things first. How did you guys get involved with the Sleep Experiment? Sarah? Auditions. They were pretty much open and Brandon, the last director liked me and that was it. Ok, cool. Damien. Auditions as well. I have never been in an actual movie before, so I really had to fight to get this part. Here I am though. I guess this is a first for both of us. We are happy to have you. Yes we are. My husband brought me the script. I completely embraced the roll of Debbie Wolf. I thought she was one of those rolls that every actress-- Actually, really quick. I am so sorry to interrupt you. I just have an idea I want to pitch to you guys. I am thinking of adding like a new layer of realism to the script so I was thinking maybe you all use your real names in the story, is that cool? Wow, yeah. That is fantastic. Right? I mean I am Nancy. Yes, right, yes! You know. She is strong. She is powerful. She is not a bitch unless she has to be a bitch. And it is nice to be in a movie where everybody is not a young, hot chick. No offense. You think I am hot? Yes! So is your husband the casting director? No, my husband is Bob Moseby. I am Mrs. Producer. His fucking wife? It is his fucking wife, man! Like am I making one of those kinds of movies? I mean, this shit happens all the time. Just be glad that you are working with an actual actress and not just some bored housewife. Yeah. And everybody knows everybody so you are not gonna have a problem with chemistry. I guess. Regardless, hey, you, Jack, you are a good filmmaker and you are gonna make a gorgeous movie. You know why? Because I am a good filmmaker? No. Because I am gonna shoot it for you. Dude, what about the Franco movie? What about the Franco movie? Has James Franco known me since I was a little kid? Has he been making movies with me since I was a little kid? Fuck James Franco! Seriously? Absolutely. One hundred percent, I am in. Shit, what if he makes me use his own guy? Uh well then I guess we are just gonna have to kill the asshole. Yeah. For real though. Man, you and me working on a feature film together. We are gonna make a great movie. And then we are gonna use the success of that great movie to make an even greater movie and so on and so forth until we fucking win an Oscar or something or die on set. Hey, hey, are you even remotely considering not doing this? Fuck no, dude. Let us make a movie, man! Yes! Let us get drunk. Hey do you know where Sam is? I think he is on set. Hey man I am gonna run to the store in ten minutes. You need anything? No thanks, man. I am good. Seen Sam? In there. Ok so the camera is going to be pushing in on you guys while you are freaking out. Now at this point you know that you are in the experiment but it feels real, right. It is like a hallucination. So just really really really play on that paranoia. Really let it build. Really sell that. Right. Great you guys look amazing. Questions? No. Great. Thank you guys. And then the sirens are gonna go off. Tony, rock those lights. Just like that. Is there gonna be a sound that goes with the lights? The sirens? Would that be helpful? It would. Ok then we will get a sound. And then after a couple beats, Sarah is gonna come in. She is gonna shoot you. Attention! Today we are using a blank gun so there will be a bang. She is a bit beyond the required minimum distance. You are both safe. Now, if anyone needs to inspect the weapon, now is the time, people. Thank you. Thanks, Josh. This is gonna be so great. Ok, ok, this is the martini, everyone. Alright, let us do this. Sound, alright sound speed. Action. I cannot think straight. I do not know what is real. It is alright. It is alright. You can trust me. You can trust me. Look at me. You can trust me. Oh shit! The fucking noise. Wahhhhh! What is that? I do not know. What is going on? Oh my God! Cut! That is a cut. Are you happy or do you want to do another take? Hell no, that was perfect. Alright, ladies and gentlmen that is a fucking wrap. You know the deal. Amazing work! That look! It felt so real. I have gotta be honest. I have never felt anything like that before. I mean I just... With this roll I figured Bob was throwing me a bone but I felt her move through me. I felt it too. I did. I cannot thank you enough for this. Thank you. Amazing. What the hell is this? Jesus Christ. Close, your husband. I was just thanking Nancy for today. She did some really wonderful work. Yeah? That is great. Do not let him ruffle your feathers. He is just paranoid because he knows I am a sucker for younger talent. Yeah, well you need all the talent you can get, sweetheart. Now if you will excuse us, the men need to talk. Thank you. That is great. Bye bye. Run along. So, good first day huh? Oh it was amazing. The performances were so much better than I thought they would be. And the scenes they were layered. The shots they were beautiful. And the crew just worked their asses off. I do not know what to say except thank you. I am super proud of what we did today. Well good. Good to hear, kid. Are you happy with all that? Am I, oh yeah. It is your movie. I am just passing through. You are happy, I am happy. You have the best job in the world. What could ever make you want to give up all of this? I do not know. Come here, walk with me. Sure. Having a little thing tonight and investors are gonna be there. So we are gonna need to rub some elbows and kiss some rings, you know what I mean? Ok, I was gonna go watch dailies. Oh, no listen Jack. There is no need for that. I got an editor putting some stuff together. We will get that to you soon enough. Oh really. I do not know. I guess I just assumed I would be editing it because I usually do that with all my stuff. No, Jack listen. You do not want that. Trust me. Look, I knew this director in the nineties. Same as you. He wanted to do everything. The guy would shoot all day. He would edit all night. He did the color correction. He scored his own movies. He did foley. He did his own foley, Jack. He was an animal. Wow, did he do anything successful? He shot himself in the face, Jack. That is my point. You cannot do it all. Jesus. Yeah, Jesus. Plus, listen. I need you to impress the people who write the checks, man, so the checks keep coming. You chose this career, right? Yeah, no I understand it. Alright, good man. This is part of the deal. I think you are gonna be really proud to have your name on this movie. Yeah? Yeah I really do. And I already feel more fulfilled than I ever have in my entire life. I cannot thank you enough. I owe you big time. I am really glad to hear you say that, kid. I mean it. Well good. I have been in this industry a long time, man and that fire that you have in you has long since burned out for me man, so. I am happy to see that. The highs are high but the lows, man. They are truly low. This business will eat you up and spit you out. Steal your soul and break your heart. Sometimes you give it everything and you just, you get nothing in return. For what it is worth, I really want to help you get that fire back, with this film. I think you will, kid. I really do. This movie is gonna be special. I think so too. Oh, hey, before you go in. We are gonna have a little chat. Ok. When I said this movie is gonna be special, I meant it. And I need someone who lives and breathes film. Someone who can see an opportunity and take it. And I think that is you, Jack. I think you are that guy. I think that you will do whatever it takes to make my movie successful. Am I right? Absolutely. Good. I have got kind of an unusual request. Sure, anything. Name it. I need the final kill in the movie to be real. Yeah it is gonna be all practical effects so it is gonna look super real, really visceral and I have some reference photos. No, no, no, no, Jack, I need the actor to die, on screen. Damien? Why? Because he is a bad man and he has done me very, very wrong and I need him dead. Can you help me with that? Are you serious? As a fucking heart attack. I do not know what you want me to say but I am not going to kill anyone. No, hey look, I do not need you to kill him. I just need your cooperation. That is it. Look, I will paint you a picture. Last day of filming, the guns, they get switched up and Nancy kills Damien. And it is an accident, you see. It is a tragedy. It is a tragic accident. Hell, we will dedicate the movie to him. Point is, we will have a hit movie on our hands. You cannot buy that kind of publicity, kid but you can plan for it. Why the fuck do you think I would ever go along with something like that. I am not a killer. You just said that you would do anything to ensure this movies success. Are you a liar, Jack? Fuck this movie, I am calling the police. Ok. Oh my God. I would not do that. Hell you would be calling them on yourself, Jack. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? You are the one with the gun. Alright, open the bag. Look, I do not understand what you are doing here but I do not-- Open the fucking bag! Do it! Jesus fuck! What the fuck is that? That is the guy you killed. I have never seen that guy before in my life. What the fuck is that? I know that and you know that but he is about to get buried in the desert with a gun covered in your prints. And your DNA. Whether or not he is ever found, now that is entirely up to you. Look, I really like you, kid. I honestly do. I see myself in you. But if you do not work with me on this deal, I am gonna have to kill everybody you love. Mommy and Daddy and Sam, even Shantel. This is not a fucking movie, right? Who the fuck do you think you are? I am the guy that gave you your start in movies, Jack. Show a little gratitude. Do you realize what people would do in this town for an opportunity like I have given you? Do you think Scorsese and De Palma and Tarantino would back down from a challenge like this? Yes! You might be right but not if they did not have a choice. See, that is the important thing to remember. You do not have a choice. Hollywood is not as glamorous as you imagined it to be, huh? Why are you doing this to me? I do not have anything to do with this. I am pointless. You do not need me for this. Oh, now do not say that. You are not pointless. You are my partner. From now on. And now you just need to ask yourself are you gonna do this movie? And get it done and get the girl and live wildly successful or are you gonna be a problem and force me to fuck up your entire life? ¶ Is what you want, your discontent is your own ¶ ¶ Waiting and plotting for something ¶ ¶ When you get what you want you do not want what you get ¶ ¶ And so you sit upon my knee. You will grow tired of being ¶ Hey, buddy. Come on, have a drink. You look a little tense. Come on drink it, I am not gonna poison you. Yet. Come on, drink. I am kidding. Lighten up, Jesus. The stress is gonna kill you, kid. You are not really talking much. Oh, hey, look at this. Look who is here. No, wait. What the fuck! Do not. She is networking. Could be a big deal for her. See that redhead? That is O. Moroni. She is a major distribution target for us. She is also interested in buying your girlfriends book. Could be a major deal. I put that together. You are welcome. She is a lovely little morsel. I need to use the bathroom. Reminds me of my wife... in 1985. I am sorry, what? I need a bathroom. Oh yeah, go find one. I got like twelve. Hey. Hey, this is Jack! Hey, this woman is interested in acquiring my book. That is great but I really need to talk to you. Would you excuse me? Oh, sure, here is your jacket. Thank you, it was so nice to meet you. We will talk later. Ok. Hey, slow down. I am wearing heals. Ooh, it is a movie theater. Ok, baby. I am really excited to hear about your first day but do you know who that was downstairs? We need to go, ok? Just trust me. There is something going on with this movie and I do not want you to be involved with it, alright? So I need you to get out of here. Sexually? No, am I serious. I am not joking. You need to go. You need to leave now. Hey, hey. You ok? You know you can tell me anything. Yeah, I just want this to be my thing. You know it is my movie and my producer so I need you to go. Did you really just say that to me? Yeah. I am really happy for you with your book and everything. I need to enjoy this by myself. Where is this coming from? I feel like I have done nothing but support you. That is your biggest flaw. I get it. This is your first movie. Are we done here? Yeah. I am going to tell my publisher that you passed on adapting my book. You ready to rehearse? Jack! Yeah. Did you hear me? Yeah, I am ready. You ready to shoot this? We did not really plan much. I just want it to be good. Ok. You got this. We need to fucking roll. We are falling behind. Any notes, boss? Just say your lines Damien. Yeah. Anything else? Just say your lines. Hey Damien, so right now we are doing a tricky visual so it is more technical than performance based so I think he just needs you to be specific. Well then why not just say so? Roll sound. Rolling. Roll camera. Rolling. And this will be a tail slate. Action. Where are they? I do not know. How do we even know we are awake? We do not. I need the final kill in the movie to be real. I need the actor to die on screen. But there is only one way to find out. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! What the fuck? That was it! Are you ok? Yeah, it is a fake fucking knife. I mean. Can anybody bring a cup of coffee for our director here? Get me a cup of coffee. Great take everyone! You fooled me. Wait, are we going again? Be honest. What is this shit you are pulling? I think Moseby is trying to sabotage me. Most directors feel that way. You just have to remember, he is looking out for the money. You are looking out for the movie. I am looking out for everyone. Fuck the movie. Fuck the movie? Wow, who are you? I think Moseby is trying to stage an accident or something. For like a writeoff or insurance or something. I do not know. How do you know? Because he fucking told me! Told you what? Spit it out! Sam, I think we are in serious-- Golly gee, can I get my DP and my director back to the fucking set?! Yes. Just give us a minute. Thank you. You believe this guy? He is a fucking lunatic. I have been on some shit movies and yes the producer usually has some batshit agenda, but you have to care. Because if you do not care then I do not give a fuck. And all those people in there, they do not care. Come on man, you are fucking William Wallace in Braveheart. Grab the boom mic and rally the fucking troops! Snap out of it, ok? Take a minute. My friend took me to this place with really good sushi and now I love it. I go all the time. It is like literally my favorite. Can you go to a sushi place and just eat rice? Cause I like rice. How do you not like sushi and live here? I mean raw fish. I do not know. What do you got after this? You mean like my next project? Yeah. I do not know. Something that is not as risky as this. Every low budget film is risky. Yes but some more than others. At least Jack is doing a really good job. Yeah, he is a lot more competent than what I am used to. Girl, what do you do to your skin? It is great. Where are you? Yeah he is a little on edge but whatever you said to him got to him real bad. Yeah um, no one else, no. No. Honestly, it looks good. Yeah, could have used more blood but it looks better than it needs to be. Yeah, yeah, sure. I will drop them in the office today. Thank you. Alright, bye bye. Gotcha, motherfucker. What? Hey! What? I cannot. I do not get a fucking signal in here. Look, I am gonna go outside. Bob! My name is Brandon Browner. I am on the set of my new film. I am being followed. I have not slept in weeks. I keep hearing sounds outside my window. Look, I am loosing my fucking mind. I cannot stand it anymore. Please I need help. If anybody can hear me or is seeing this can find me. Oh my God! No! No! Damn it, I forgot my line. Yeah you did! Shit, I am sorry. Okay I am walking back in. I will take care of it. Yeah. Condescend me motherfucker! I will fucking kill you! Son of a bitch. Fuck. Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Damn it! Hey man. Hey. Look, I did not want to say anything in front of the actors but you have just been really unfocused with them. Yeah. I know. Sorry. I have been really tired. I have not been getting any sleep. Yeah, everyone can tell. Here, I just made up a shot list for tomorrow. I want you to take a look at that? Right, just put that in my pocket real quick. Just promise me that you will not open it here. Wait until you are home. Ok. And when you open it, do not call me. Do not text me. Do not say anything. Just wait for me to talk to you and then I will explain. Dude, you are really freaking me out. I promise you I will explain. Just... Just trust me. Jack! You look well rested. We have got a big day coming up. You ready for it? Got to finish the movie, right? That is a good attitude to have. Hey Jack, Sarah wants to see you in makeup. Excuse me. Sarah? Come in. You sure this is a good time? I am covered in blood. It is a great time. Take a seat. It is gonna take me a long time to get cleaned up so I thought we could talk about this scene so I do not hold everybody up. That is considerate of you. I know the drill. What has been up with you lately? You seem frazzled. It is this film. It is insane. Is Bob not treating you right? How well do you know Bob? Why do you ask? I do not trust him. Do you mind? What? I cannot reach my back. Yeah. I do not trust him either. I think it is just his personality. But you cannot control the people who come into your life. You can control how they fit into your life. I thought you wanted to talk to me about the scene. I have done a lot of these low budget indie movies. A good director is really hard to find. Just keep doing what you are doing and we will make it through. Thanks. I appreciate that. Just keep making me look good every time I call action. That I can do. Are you sure there was nothing about the scene that you wanted to talk about? No, I am good. Where is everyone going? Bob cut us all checks. The day is over. Sorry, man. Cannot argue with the boss. Who did he cut? All of us. What the fuck? You fired my whole crew? It is my crew. And they are not fired. Call it a half day. Besides, this gives us more alone time so we can make sure everything is in place for the finale. Which reminds me. The new ending. It is actually pretty good. I know. That is the producers job, to set the movie up for success. Where is Sam? Who? Sam, where is he? Oh yeah, the little guy with the glasses? I think he is in the screening room watching dailies. You can go check. Get the picture, kid? Good. You should know that if you are thinking about playing detective again, I will fire you next. See you in the morning. Hi, Jack? I am Allen. I am the new AD. It is very nice to meet you. Have you worked with Bob before? No. This is a first for me but he is very nice. Ok great, try and keep up. Oh hey dude, dude, dude, hey. I read the note. What the fuck is this? Shhhhh! Ok, what? Just meet me at my place later tonight ok? I will tell you everything. Alright? Alright. Dude you look like shit. Do not worry about it right now. Let us just shoot these fucking effects scenes. Alright. Alright everybody, let us go! Jesus fucking Christ, man! They have been lying to all of us! There is no world outside these four walls. The only world we are ever going to know is right here! Of course we could always leave but where are we gonna go? It is because I want the best for you and I love you, that I have to do this. Nancy, we are so close. Ok, we are almost out of here. We are so close! This is my sacrifice. Nancy, no! Please, give me the gun, love. Just do not. We can find a way out of here. I know the way out of here. You are not strong enough to do it for the both of us. Cut! That is a cut! And that is a wrap on Sarah! Jesus, Jack. Hey man. I have got some music I want to show you. I might want to put it in the movie. Did you see this note? What are you doing? The house could be bugged. Bugged? Are you fucking with me? Look at me, Sam we do not have a lot of time, ok? I really need you to listen to me as carefully as you possibly can. Ok? Ok. Bob threatened to kill my family and Shantel and you, Sam on day one. He told me if I did not go along with it he was gonna frame me for the murder of Brandon Browner and he was gonna kill everyone, man. Fucking insane. I do not... Why? Why the fuck would he do that? He is just a shitty movie producer. And who the fuck is Brandon Browner? He is the original director of the movie that we are making. The one that dropped out. He is dead. And Bob has my fingerprints on the gun that shot him. I saw the body. And he killed our AD and he was working with that guy. What for? He wants Damiens death to be real. What? Why? On camera. He wants to frame it into an accident and he wants to turn it into some sort of Brandon Lee death box office stunt thing, man. I do not know, dude. I am losing my fucking mind, man. I need you to calm down right now, man and just tell me what the fuck is he doing this for? I do not fucking know, man. Why does Tarantino like feet? All he told me was that Damien did something wrong and if I went along with it, then he would leave me and Shantel alone forever. Ok, I am going to call the cops right now. No, no, no, no, no. Yes. No! He has got people with black leather gloves and guns type people. Oh! Jesus Christ, man. I am serious. Do you not believe me? I do not know, man. Just... this is fucking-- Why the fuck did you not tell me in the very beginning? I am sorry, man. I am really, really, really sorry. I was just really scared. Please do not hate me, dude. I do not hate you. Ok? I am sorry, alright? I just hate that you had to go through this all alone. Jack, I am here now. I cannot let you go through with this. What are we talking about, fucking murder? Oh, gentlemen, good to see you. Jack, I was wondering if I could talk to you in private for a second. I wanted to go over the last scene. You can cut the shit. He knows. That was not our plan. Yeah well do you want to finish the movie or not? I need my DP. And you I assume understand the consequences if you decide to try something stupid? Yeah, I am aware. I really do not like this, Jack. Join the club, Bob. Alright, alright fine. How about we discuss our day then, shall we? Alright, I control the weapon, you got that? The two of you try to outnumber me or something and take it, I will kill you. End of story. So what do you want us to do? I do not want you to do shit except shut the fuck up. You are going to block the scene, alright? Make sure the whole crew can see it. Tell them how you are gonna shoot it in your artistic vision and all that bullshit. Then, when you start to set up the shots, pull Damien aside and tell him we are doing this with a closed set. What is my reason? I do not fucking care. You are the director. Directors are motivators and manipulators. So motivate and manipulate. And then? And then let the scene play out. You got one shot at this. Do not fuck it up. So Jack, what are we doing here? Uh, sorry. Yes, ok, so we are just going to pick up the scene where we left off yesterday. Ok? Ok. So you have your gun trained on him and you say your line. Um just do not. Please, put the gun down, love. You are not strong enough to do this for the both of us. Ok and um so, you are gonna be dirty in frame so you are gonna be all the way right of frame. You are gonna be blocking where Sarah was since we do not have her anymore. Right. So Sam is going to be right here with the camera. I am gonna be right here at the monitor watching all this go down. And uh you will continue. Ok, um. What is it-- You give me the line. That you say again? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You are not strong enough to do this for the both of us. We can find a way out of here. I already know the way out. Cut. That was good. Hey boss. Can I have a word? Yeah, of course. Come in. What is up? I just have something I wanted to run by you. I wanted to do this on a closed set. Yeah, why? Just because I think that this is a really vulnerable moment for you. So I want to just make sure there are as few distractions as possible. Just a really small crew. Shoot it MOS and you know, I just want to create a really safe, intimate environment for you to be able to work in. So I, you know, I think that you deserve that. I am embarrassed but I do not know what MOS is. My first movie, remember? No, I get that. I get that. MOS just means that there is not going to be any sound so we will have you run through your actions and your lines and everything the same but, you know just so we can capture it at its peak. Are you cool with that? I like it. It is fitting. It is sad, isolated, alone, just like this story. Just like this world. You know I really respect you, Jack. You are a great director. A smart man. You are gonna be big after this. I can tell. Thanks Damien, you too. I will see you out there. See you out there. You ready? That is a good man in there. I do not know what he did to you but I hope you burn in hell for what is about to happen. That good man in there has been fucking my wife for the last six months. So it is his price to pay. I am just the debt collector. Nancy broke my heart and now I am gonna break hers. See you on the set. Action. Just do not. Please, give me the gun, love. You are not strong enough to do this for the both of us. We can find a way out of here. I already know the way out. Cut! Oh! Come on, boss, again? How do you expect us to get there emotionally if you keep cutting our takes? What are you doing, Jack? I am not doing it. What? I said no. Cut the shit, man. Get over there and direct the scene. You know what, Bob? This is my movie and I just thought up an ending. Tell me. Go fuck yourself. That is good. Alright. No, hey, wait, wait, wait! Oh no, no, no, Sam back off. Nancy. What the fuck is going on, guys? Yeah, Bob. What the fuck is going on? Is there some rewrite I do not know about here, sweetheart? Damiens execution, is that it? What? Yeah well none of this would be happening if it were not for fucking Damien, would it? What? You are fucking my wife! No I am not! I-- Do not fucking lie to me you piece of shit! Fuck! I swear on my mothers grave. He is right, Bob. He is telling you the truth. He is right. Is he? I know you are fucking around on me, Nancy. I just do not know why! Did it ever even matter when I was just your trophy wife? Showing up in all those shitty, cheap shit, low rent, low budget lousy fucking movies. All those soul crushing cameos. I did that because I was in love with you. Oh give me a fucking break! You were in love with me and that is why you took the soul crushing cameos? You could not get any fucking work anywhere else. You married a fucking producer to get a career! None of you guys would have a fucking thing if it was not for Bob Moseby! You would not have shit! You would be directing god damn student films on a fucking iPhone! I ought to kill everybody in this fucking room! Starting with you, sweetheart! Oh, Jesus! Sarah you just killed the man, what the fuck? What the hell is this? Bob was right, I was cheating. He was wrong about the guy. And when I found out that he wanted to kill Damien-- You knew this, this whole fucking time and you were going to let it happen? Listen, for the past two weeks I have done everything in my power to ensure that that does not happen. Fuck you! I fucking trusted you! I am getting the fuck out of here. No, do not! Do not. We need you, Damien. We need you. Well, you should have thought about that before all of you were going to fucking let me die! Damien, we saved you. All of us together. And now we need to finish this together. What the hell are we supposed to say to the crew? We are fucked. I saw Bob have a mental breakdown. He realized this movie was a mess. It was not going to bring back his career the way he wanted it to so he shot himself. Yeah. Yeah, I saw that too. What about the people working for him? What about them? It was just me and Josh. This is not the movies, Jack. And the evidence framing me? It is gone. You do not have to worry about that anymore. All we have to do is what we do best, act, tell a good story. We all stay out of jail. We all beat Bob. We all win. What is it gonna be, Jack? They have been lying to all of us! There is no world outside these four walls. The only world we are ever going to know is right here. Excuse me, could you help me find the director? I think I am lost. Hey. Hey. I am really glad you came. Nothing else was playing. Oh, man. Yeah. I am so proud of you. You did it. How do you feel? Honestly it feels like I wish it never happened. This business changes people. It can make them do crazy things. You deserve better. Well if you ever need to talk to someone you know I am here for you. I still care about you, you know? I brought this just in case you could come. Do not feel like you have to read it or use it or anything. I just thought you might like to have it. Ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage, the director of The Sleep Experiment Mr. Jack Archer! I guess that is me.
