Jj Jj Jj Your wife and child are now with god. Fuck you. Jj I heard my wife and child are with you. Can I speak with them? I can't hear you. Hmm. Welcome. Clever. Excuse me? Something for everyone. I'm sorry for your loss. Why are you here? I want to speak with her. That's not what I do. Well, then you can't help me. Do you have something that belonged to her? An object of some kind? An accident. Jj How long since your last confession? You go first. - Pardon me? - I will, but... First your sins. What's the matter, my son? Jj I'm listening. Are you sure it was him? He reported his car stolen. Hey! I just asked you a fucking question. Are you sure it was him? Would you like to join your wife? Get lost. Idiot. J when can we expect to be friends? J j when will this longing for you ever end? J j just between you and me j j don't feel my heart will ever be free j j you keep breaking... j J yes, I tempt people to see j j my favorite pictures of you and me j j I blew a kiss and I let you go j j the price was high...

Search and ye shall find. Knock and the door shall be opened for you. Is it me that is not knocking hard enough or is there no one home? I know men that have never prayed to you once and yet you gave them everything. I have prayed to you every day since I was a child. And what have you given me? You sent me to that lovely place where they cared for me... In your name. In your name. For nothing in heaven or on earth happens without your permission or knowledge. But I continued to pray and... And you sent me more of those loving people. And now you take away the only person that ever loved me. The only person I ever trusted. That I... cannot forgive. You, sir, have been complicit in an awful lot of crimes. You know what I believe now? Either you do not care or you do not exist. I'm sorry. I know it's not your fault. No. It's the devil's fault. It's your fault. It's your fault. You can't get involved, god, otherwise you'll be cancelling our free will. You can't stop innocent people being killed. You're not a cop. So what's the lesson for today? It's not the ceiling's fault, it's your fault! It's not the ceiling's fault, it's your fault! If I'm so small and insignificant, why do you spend all of your time messing with a nobody like me? Why is the prince of darkness spending eternity messing with a nobody like me? You know what? Why don't you come on up? Why don't you just come on up and we'll get it on right now? Show yourself! Come on! Show yourself! What the hell are you doing here? The door was open. I know you didn't mean what you said today, Robert. Then you don't know me. Don't fuckin' touch me! You hear? Keep your hands to yourself. I understand your anger. Get out. I'm not leaving you in the state you're in, Robert. That's not legal, father. It's trespassing. I can't read god's mind, and I can't always explain his ways. Then do us all a favor and keep your mouth shut and let me grieve in peace. It seems your god takes all the good people and leaves the assholes behind. Whether your wife was good or not is irrelevant. What did you say? If she was a bad woman, would you have objected to god taking her? What are you saying about my wife? - Don"t lose your faith, Robert. - Too late. I buried it today. And with it... l buried god too. How's your faith, father? Do you practice it? Now the other cheek. I said give me the other cheek! What do you feel, father? Pain? Anger? Revenge? I forgive you. I don't want your forgiveness! I want your honesty! Hit me! Come on, hit me! When a man escapes certain death, you claim it's a miracle, and when another man doesn't, you say his time has come. You have an answer for everything. All you know is to say warm and fuzzy words every Sunday, collect some cash and make excuses for god. Fuck you. You had a funeral today, Robert. So did I. I have a funeral almost every day. I'd rather rip my heart out than try to comfort people. What would you say to a mother who has lost her 15-year-old daughter to rape and murder? What do you say to such a mother? What would you say? That... she'll never see her child again? That her daughter does not exist anymore? Even in heaven? Is that what you would say? I thought so. I feel their pain, and I suffer because my words are inadequate. Some people find strength in them. They find hope. They may be warm and fuzzy words, but what is so terrible about what we do every Sunday? A few tired souls gathering to reflect on a 2000-year-old story of a magnificent man... Who said something quite extraordinary and revolutionary. Love your enemy. Forgive your enemy. Is that so bad? As for the cash, I just ask for a few lazy coins, so I can feed some poor bastards whose life is a hell of a lot worse than yours, Robert. I tell you, it's hell out there and you need faith and courage and character to face it. If they can crucify a man who healed the sick and claimed to be the son of god, what do you think they'll do to you out there, Robert? In this life, you will either be a victim or a perpetrator. And if you are lucky, there'll be moments when you are neither. Well, I guess I'm both today, your holiness... I never claimed a priest doesn't sin. I'm flesh and blood, and I have to battle like all flesh. I have the same temptations like all men. The same dick like all men. And I battle the same desires and demons. I struggle to master my passions. I don't always win. But I fight. Behold the messenger of god! The message of god does not lose validity because the messenger stumbles. If you need a reason not to believe in god, don't blame a priest who sins as your excuse. Bravo. All care... no responsibility. I best be going. I've done you a great disservice today. Forgive me. Wait. I think it's human not to understand god, because if we did understand him, he wouldn't be god. Well, if there is a god, I'm sure he understands why I'm a little disappointed. I said wait! Why? I have something for you. J I promise you this j j if you shut those weary eyes j j you know it won't take long j j it's been a bad day j j that's best left behind j J you better lie still j j 1 won't let you out of my sight j j won't let the night creep in j j and come and claim you j j as one of its own j J hush your mouth, child j j there's so much you've seen requires explaining j j hush your mouth now j j all those questions, questions j j where we've been j j and I don't know what the answer is j j and I don't know what the answer is j j and I don't know what the answer is j j to settle you down j For those poor bastards you mentioned. Thank you. Don't thank me, father. I don't want them in the house. Would you like some of god's finest, father? Straight from the garden of Eden. No, thank you. It's not a sin, is it? I mean, god created all things good. Where do you think they are? This is your area of expertise. - I don't know. - It's your business to know. Nice easy answer. Which section? I heard there's many rooms in our father's mansion. A good one, I suspect. Good. They deserve to be in a good section. Father... I have a confession to make. This is some of the best shit that I've smoked in a long time. No one has a monopoly on pain. Accept it and face it. Else, everything you do to numb it will lead to more pain. You gonna smoke that? Words. Words, words, words. Talk is cheap. I'm speaking from experience. I never knew my mother. As for my father, he kicked me out when I decided to become a priest. Well... you can't possibly know what I feel for my wife. Is that so? Well, have you ever...? - Sorry? - Father... I don't follow. Father, have you ever had sex with a woman? - No. - No? Never? I have never had sex with a woman. Jesus, you sound like a politician. So you're a virgin then? I expect that's the definition. Well... Lecture me about human relations once you've had some. I'm starving. - You want a sandwich? - I'm fasting. I got nothing vegetarian in the house. Except this. I kissed a girl once. You're a bit old to be kissing young girls, father. I was 15. Tell me. Where did you kiss her? On the cheek. I couldn't sleep for a week. There are better places to kiss than cheeks, father. Believe me. You know, I can't ever imagine not being with a woman. I don't know how you do it, father. You're a man of experience then? Just a mere ordinary mortal. You know, I can order a lady for you if you like. I mean, no one would have to know. Can we change the subject? You ever been with a man, father? A boy perhaps? Don't you ever feel lonely? I don't appreciate what you're trying to do, Robert. Hey, hey, hey... I'm just trying to understand your level of experience with the human condition. I think I know exactly what you're trying to do. Tsk! Come on, father! No one escapes a tug of the love muscle. Surely you've done that! If you want my confession, I suggest you become a priest first. We're just two men bonding. Now, what's wrong with that? Jj That's enough! Enough! Do you really need these? It's not what you think. I don't think I can compete with these magazines. Is this the woman you want me to be? Do you want me to do these things for you? Will that make you happy? Would you like me to look at this if this was your wife? My wife wouldn't be doing porn. If you loved all the women in the world like your wife, would you want them to be doing pornography? I don't love all the women in the world, so it's a stupid question. God loves all the women in the world more than you loved your wife. You know nothing of my love for my wife. Is there anything you want to get off your chest? You want my confession, father? Call it what you will. Look. I'm not one of your little old lambs running for confession because they know that they're at death's door. Only god can know who's at death's door. I'm not afraid of dying. But life scares the hell out of you, Robert. How about a story from the confessional box? You know I can't disclose someone's confession. I didn't ask for names! Just some stories. Father, I've sinned. I stole my aunt Rosie's recipe books for sponge cake. What must I do, father, to have my terrible sins absolved? One hundred hail Marys. No sponge cake for a year. Well... Whatever torments a person, whatever torments them. Conscience is god's gift and burden to humanity. But guilt is a lifetime sentence. That's what the enemy exploits to destroy us. The enemy? The enemy. I struggle to believe that there's a god, and you think that I believe that there's a devil? That's what he wants us to think. To hell with Lucifer. I buried him today as well. Never mention his name. Where his name is mentioned, so is he. Wooh! I think that's enough entertainment for the day. We're not done yet. What's the worst thing you ever heard during confession? - I'm afraid I can't help you. - I'll make it easy for you. First case: Married man confesses to banging his wife's sister, yes or no? Second case: Teenage girl falls pregnant to her teacher. Yes, no? Third case... - Priest abuses 12-year-old boy, yes, no? That's pretty fucked up, that is. I made it up. Yeah? Which bit, exactly? The priest? Or the boy's age? I never heard such a confession. - You ever made one? - I know it's happened. It's happened? And what did you do about it, father? Everyone gets their just sentence eventually. I haven't been to confession since I was a boy. I couldn't think of any bad things I had done, so I made something up. But he quickly reminded me that they were in heaven with god. So I guess I committed the sin of lying and now I had something to confess. The next time I was prepared. I made up a whole list of sins he couldn't check. All lies, of course. This time, I wasn't going to disappoint. And it's been a sinless life ever since. I wish I could say the same. Is there something you want to get off your chest, father? Maybe. You have masturbated! You have a very limited imagination, Robert. You abused a boy. I wanted to kill a man. What are you talking about? All I can tell you is a man came to confess to me years ago. He was distraught and had difficulty starting his confession. I waited for him to begin, but all I could hear was the silence of his tears. Eventually, he found the courage and spoke. He confessed that he had accidentally hit a young girl while driving home late and didn't stop. What happened to the girl? She survived... in a wheelchair. You son of a bitch. I wanted to choke him with my bare hands... My anger made me curious. I wanted to see who it was. To my surprise, he turned... Like he wanted me to see him. Perhaps he wanted me to turn him in to the police. He was new to the parish. He wasn't married. He just looked after his ailing mother. You let that bastard walk! Is that your idea of justice? That is my sin: I wanted to kill a man. No, father, your sin is much greater than that. Your sin is not reporting a criminal. What is spoken in confession is privileged and confidential, you know that. What ever happened to morality? I told him that he may have reconciled with god, and god forgave him, but that he must reconcile himself with society. A sin is not always a crime, father, but a crime is twice a sin. I told him he must turn himself into the police, that's all I could do. Not good enough! "Those who refuse to obey the laws of the land are refusing to obey god, and punishment will follow." Romans 13. Without confession to society his confession to god is void. - You think you know your faith... - You denied that girl justice! Don't you ever doubt my love and pain for that little girl. Please, you heartless bastard. She was my niece. And you did nothing! Mr. know-it-all. I'm giving you more excuses not to believe in god, religion and everything that goes with it. You're full of bravado, Robert. You want to save the world? Start with yourself. You could've made a difference, but you didn't. Not according to my position as a priest! A man comes to me... A man comes to me, in confidence, with a terrible secret that burdens him, and you want me to become a snitch. Isn't that how you describe it? You're a coward. There's nothing worse than feeling helpless, when all you want is revenge. I have to live with that for the rest of my life. He crippled your niece. You sound like a superhero. You want me to give you his name? Give it! - If I give you his name, you'll have to go to the police. Give me the name, and I'll go right this minute. And after that, we can break another confession. I don't give a shit! Your wife's last confession. What did you say? No one's perfect, Robert. No one's perfect. Ask me for the man's name, so that you can go and do justice for this poor girl that you feel so much for. Come on, ask me the name. Ask me the name and then we can open your wife's file. Aren't you concerned that there may have been injustices done towards you, Robert? Aren't you curious? Hmm? Get out of my house. You're not welcome anymore. What happened to your crusade to save the world, Robert? Aren't you curious as to whether your wife was cheating on you? Don't fuckin' push me. Aren't you curious about your wife's last confession? - My wife never came to you. - Really? Are you sure? I knew my wife. I'll tell you what, Robert... This will make it easier to have this conversation. What are you doing? Look. We're just two men bonding. I've just retired from the priesthood. What are you afraid of? Nothing. You have no business with me. You made it my business today, Robert. I knew my wife. She loved me. She never came to you for confession. You know nothing! A doubting Thomas. She told me about the first time. You forced your will upon her. Weren't your own sins enough, Robert? You know what's funny about people, Robert? Someone fooled them into believing they own their bodies. You own nothing. Only what you make with your two hands. Your body is on loan, Robert. You're its tenant, not its landlord. You don't create life. Life comes through you, not from you. Life doesn't give a damn about my religion or your ideology. Life doesn't care how it comes about. Whether it's from love or rape... Through marriage or outside it... Life only has one purpose: To beget itself. It makes no moral judgments. That's the landlord's business. So when you decided to terminate life's journey... Life tried again. You fuckin' bastard. Anger is the best medicine for grieving. That's enough. Ask me for the man's name you want to hand over to the police and we can discuss your wife's entire confession. I knew my wife. She was perfect. Except for that little break you had. You did have a little break, didn't you? Yes, she told me during confession. - Robert... - Get out. Don't you want to know who was fucking the hell out of your little wifey? I warned you. I warned you, but you wouldn't listen. Now look at you. Now look at you. You pathetic fuck. What was your wife's favorite book? What was your wife's favorite color? What was your wife's favorite dress? I thought you knew your wife, Robert. Too busy, self-absorbed, weren't you? Huh? I thought you knew your wife, Robert. Get the hell out of my house and take your god with you. I told you, don't push me. I'll fuckin" kill you. You better hurry up, I've got a fundraiser at the church. What sort of man are you? See, Robert... I'm flesh and blood just like you. I warned you... She came and saw me on the day of the accident, Robert. Why, Robert? What happened to honesty? I loved her. Love is not enough. She was in tears when she came to see me. She didn't stay long. She was hysterical. I offered to drive her home. She refused. She said she wanted to walk. She saw everything. I warned you too, Robert. God didn't take your wife, did he, Robert? Shut up... It has a certain lightness to it, doesn't it? I have a dying wish, Robert. I want to sin. I want a woman. You asked me if I ever get lonely. I do. Especially at night when I'm lying in my bed alone. Just like you. I've often imagined myself with a beautiful woman. I've often imagined myself with my pregnant wife, going for quiet romantic walks, discussing the name of our future child, just like you. I've often imagined myself there at the birth of my child. But I don't have a child. I don't have a wife. I don't have a family. I have nothing. Just like you. Call me an ambulance, Robert. Pray for one. Please, Robert. Go to hell. For those poor bastards. No point taking the past with you, Robert. Robert, do you want to hear a joke? Four religious men and an atheist die. After death... The Christian looks around at his heavenly surroundings and it confirms everything his religion taught him. "It's all true,” he says. "I was right!" And then the Jew arrives, Robert, and he sees his surroundings and they confirm everything he was taught in the synagogue. “It's all true. I was right!” he says. The same happens with the Buddhist and the Muslim when they view their surroundings. And then the atheist arrives and he looks around but all he sees is nothing. Just darkness. He smiles proudly and says, “it's all true. I was right!” Your wife and child are not with god. They don't exist. Because there is no god. There is no heaven. Just the hell of non-existence.
