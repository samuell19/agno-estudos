Very well. - Jake, please, you need to help us! Please! Very well. - I can't believe this is how it's going to end. - Yeah. Becoming a mindless arcade game character - I can't believe this is how it's going to end. is not exactly my plan to go out. - I can't believe this is how it's going to end. Hey, you okay? - Doesn't matter. None of it does. In the morning, we're gonna be just like Jake, None of it does. no memory of our lives, None of it does. our family, nothing. None of it does. Did you guys notice anything strange about The King? - What, besides him being a total tool? Did you guys notice anything strange about The King? - Yeah, besides that. Did you guys notice anything strange about The King? - You know, he did seem different from the others, like, you know, more like us. - You know, he did seem different from the others, - Exactly. - You know, he did seem different from the others, He seemed less... - You know, he did seem different from the others, controlled. - It doesn't make any sense. controlled.

You remind me of someone, someone so beautiful... You remind me of someone, me... back there, where I had a name. The reason he seems more like you is because he is like you! The reason he seems more like you The King, he came here from your world. The reason he seems more like you Legend has it his incredible abilities provided him with great power here, here... Legend has it his incredible abilities in our home. Eventually he challenged the former rulers of this land. Sarah: The Super Boss. Eventually he challenged the former rulers of this land. - Exactly. Eventually he challenged the former rulers of this land. It was a-- Eventually he challenged the former rulers of this land.

A wielder of the power of Rancala Eventually he challenged the former rulers of this land. and somehow is able to stop the countdown Eventually he challenged the former rulers of this land. and, uh, save himself.

That's terrible. - Yes. It is a sad story, yes, but certainly not the first one. It is a sad story, yes, And, unless you succeed where all of us have failed... I fear it will not be the last. Beware of The King. He once had the chance to return to our world. Beware of The King. Yes. Beware of The King. But when he faced the opportunity to go home, Beware of The King. he decided to stay and take his place as the new King. Beware of The King.

But our fate, the four of us-- - There's got to be a way to save him. - Clock run out long time ago - There's got to be a way to save him. when he challenged The King and lost. - There's got to be a way to save him. [ sighs ] Same as me. I'm sorry... [ sighs ] Same as me. but there's no saving him now.

He made his way through Rancala level by level, - Nicely done. singlehandedly dispatching his enemies, - Nicely done. a feat that had only been done once before... - Nicely done. by me. - There's your problem right there, by me. both of yours. by me. You've spent so long worrying about fighting every battle by yourselves You've spent so long that you forgot the truth. You've spent so long There's strength in numbers. You've spent so long And while there may be no greater power in all of Rancala, You've spent so long in my world, there's something stronger. You've spent so long It's called family... You've spent so long and my brother, he's not alone, not anymore, because we're here, and my brother, he's not alone, and we're taking him home. and my brother, he's not alone, - "No greater power in all of Rancala." Nicely done. - "No greater power in all of Rancala." - Told you that extra intelligence - "No greater power in all of Rancala." would come in handy. - "No greater power in all of Rancala." - Give me the order, my King, - "No greater power in all of Rancala." and I will cut out her tongue and feed it to the beast. - "No greater power in all of Rancala." - Jake, I know you don't remember me right now, okay? - Jake, I know you don't remember me right now, You don't remember any of us or anything before this, - Jake, I know you don't remember me right now, but we remember you. - Jake, I know you don't remember me right now, - Jake, you had a life before you came here. I mean, you were happy, - Jake, you had a life before you came here. and, more than that, you were free. - Jake, you had a life before you came here. You're family, our family. - We spent our days in that arcade You're family, our family. tucked in the back corner of the mall. You're family, our family. Every day after school, we would go, You're family, our family. and we would play games, You're family, our family. and we'd laugh and talk You're family, our family. until our parents made us go home. You're family, our family. - You and I, we were always the last two to leave. - Jake, that arcade was where we discussed our dreams - You and I, we were always the last two to leave. and ultimately our grand plan to open up our own arcade - You and I, we were always the last two to leave. and not one in the back - You and I, we were always the last two to leave. of some crappy old shopping mall, either. - You and I, we were always the last two to leave. - I'm sorry, Jake. I'm so sorry that I left you that night, and I'm sorry that I stopped searching, I'm so sorry that I left you that night, but I never stopped thinking about you. I'm so sorry that I left you that night, We did it. We built our own arcade, and it's waiting for you in our world. We built our own arcade, It's waiting for you to remember. Remember where you came from, Jake. Remember who you are. - Sarah. - [ sobs ] - Sarah. - Rae. Chrissy. I remember. I remember everything. - [ sobbing ] I remember everything. - You do realize that, in order to go home, you have to defeat the current Super Boss? - You do realize that, in order to go home, Maybe you'll have better luck than your brother. - You do realize that, in order to go home, Maybe you can succeed where he failed. - You do realize that, in order to go home, I'm sure he remembers how he lacked the skill to defeat me, I'm sure he remembers beaten and alone, I'm sure he remembers lost in a strange land. I'm sure he remembers He had two choices, to die or serve me... He had two choices, and serve me he did. - What are you doing? - I'm fighting him alone. - What are you doing? - Jake, we need to fight him together to win. - What are you doing? - Did you not hear anything she just said? - What are you doing? - I'm not gonna be second place, not to him. - What are you doing? - Are you serious? - What are you doing? After everything we've just done to come and save you? - What are you doing? - This is exactly how you got - What are you doing? into this mess in the first place! - What are you doing? - I have to finish it. - What are you doing? - You can try.

Told you I could handle it. - Um, where's the portal? - That's what I was just thinking. - Portal? - That's what I was just thinking. - The portal home. - That's what I was just thinking. When you defeat the Super Boss, - That's what I was just thinking. there's supposed to be a portal. - That's what I was just thinking. - Okay, hang on a second. - That's what I was just thinking. Why didn't that rhino attack? - That's what I was just thinking. - [ snorts ] - That's what I was just thinking. - I mean, what's the point of having something like that - That's what I was just thinking. if you're not even gonna use it? - That's what I was just thinking. - Maybe it knows who the, uh, true King really is. - That's what I was just thinking. - Oh, my God. [ scoffs ] - That's what I was just thinking. - Really? - That's what I was just thinking. - What? - That's what I was just thinking. What? - That's what I was just thinking. The King: Where is it?! - That's what I was just thinking. Where's the portal?! - That's what I was just thinking. - You were saying? - That's what I was just thinking. - It's supposed to be here! [ The King panting ] - It's supposed to be here! If you defeat the Super Boss, - It's supposed to be here! the portal appears, and I can go home! - It's supposed to be here! Those are the rules! - It's supposed to be here! Rae: Maybe we all have to fight him. - It's supposed to be here! Sarah: That's why there's no portal. - It's supposed to be here! - Where is it? - That's not good. - [ countdown chiming ] - Where is it? That's really not good. Computer: Super Boss fight! - Now you will pay for your insolence! Computer: Super Boss fight! Feel the wrath of my full power! Computer: Super Boss fight! [ yells ] - Are you ready to do this again?

Come on! - [ groans ] - [ yells ] - [ cracking ] [ all moaning, coughing ] - [ laughs ] I admit all that talk about family made me want to go back home. I admit all that talk about family [ laughs ] I admit all that talk about family For a moment. I admit all that talk about family Then I remembered why I'm the Super Boss! Why I defeated everything in this place alone, Then I remembered why I'm the Super Boss! by myself, with no one to help me! Then I remembered why I'm the Super Boss! That is why your roads will end here. Looks like there's not gonna be a portal for anyone. Any last words? - Yeah. Resist. - Fight! - [ growls ] [ screaming ] [ energy wave pulses ] - That felt interesting. - Is he dead? - No, but he will be soon. - Is he dead? - We thought you were dead. - Is he dead? - They tried, but it did not end well for them. - Is he dead? - [ whoosh ] - I think that's our ride. - Is he dead? - Finally. - Is he dead? - Wait! Aren't you coming with us? - Wait! - No. Someone must stay behind, become the new Super Boss, - No. someone who will rule this land and its people justly. - No. I will gladly accept such a task.

I can't believe we did it. - Do you think, because he didn't go in with us, I can't believe we did it. he wasn't able to come out with us? I can't believe we did it. Boy: Come on. Let's go. I can't believe we did it. Come on. Almost there. I can't believe we did it. Come on. - [ video game zapping ] I can't believe we did it. - Come on. Get him. Get him. I can't believe we did it.

It just didn't feel right. I couldn't leave him in there. - You did the right thing. I couldn't leave him in there. - Are you sure about that? I couldn't leave him in there. - Sorry I tried killing you guys. I couldn't leave him in there. Spending half your life trapped inside of an arcade game I couldn't leave him in there. can do some serious damage to your psyche. I couldn't leave him in there. - But you are okay now, yeah? I couldn't leave him in there. - Yeah, I'm good. I couldn't leave him in there. - Okay, good. I couldn't leave him in there. - So the two of you remember everything that happened? I couldn't leave him in there. - Yep. I couldn't leave him in there. - Whoa. I couldn't leave him in there. - How come they came back as kids? I couldn't leave him in there. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. - Look on the bright side. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. Now the two of you have your very own arcade. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. that you can play in whenever you want. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. - You always play for free. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. You, I am not so sure about. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. - That's fair. - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. [ both laugh ] - Maybe you just come out the same age you go in. - Wow! - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. - Can't believe you did it. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. You really did it. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. I'm proud of you. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. - Proud of you too, little bro. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. - Hey, I'm still older than you. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. - Yeah, nobody's gonna believe that. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. Which reminds me, we should probably call Mom and Dad. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. Don't know how that conversation's gonna go, - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. but I'm sure they'll be very happy to see you. - You're the inspiration behind this whole place. - Hey, that's us. - We make a pretty good team, huh? - Hey, that's us. - Yeah.
