The Favorite Son Hello. Raphaël? – Is it you, son? – Yep. – Is it six already? – Yep. I brought you olives. That's nice. My legs feel heavy in the afternoon. I poured cold water on them. Look at me. What a mess. Let me help. Thanks. – They're good. Did you come alone? – Yep. Why didn't you bring your friend? Because I came to see you. We can't really speak with someone else around. She's a beautiful girl. She has a mole here, right? Yep. Sure you don't want one? Here, put your legs up here. You're going to end up like me. You're not getting remarried. So many things come into play... – Is it okay? – Yes. It all depends on you. – That's all I can say. – Do you have any regrets? No, I lived like this. I got my fair share. I got enough women. I have a way to go if I want to catch up with you. I didn't satisfy them all... Are you all done? Things are different now. I just did an endurance test. They told me everything's fine. I have no reason not to believe them. But deep down, I can feel things are different. It's become fragile. As if it wasn't my own. – What's that? – Odette brought it to me this morning. She always knits the sleeves too short. – I keep thinking I ought to visit her. – You should. It would make her happy. – She's a wonderful woman. – Why didn't you marry her, then? What difference would it have made? Are you leaving? Can you take care of the paperwork? They're picking it up tonight. Oh, here. You forgot your tickets for the bout. Tuesday. I hope I'll be out by then. How are things at the hotel? Things are great. Are things moving along at the building site? No problem. – Sign here. – You do it. See you tomorrow, son. Non disturbare. – Hello? – We need to talk. – I asked to be left alone. – I'm in room #6. Open up. – What's going on? – He's downstairs. We need to talk before we fuck things up. What's with you? You need to find 50 grand. Not fuck at 3:00pm. I'm not asking you what you do with your own dick. I always find a solution, don't I? – How does he look? – Hello. He'll be smiling big time tomorrow. A look at the books and he'll get it right away. He's no small-time accountant. Everyone plays with book entries. – No, you had me forge documents. – Want one? – Did you have a better plan? – No. It would have meant more forgery. – Why not? – Are you nuts? He's here! Downstairs! You're a pro. He won't see a thing. We've gone too far. It's too obvious now. That's a loser mentality. That's because we've lost. – I can't do this for you anymore. – Then don't. You still haven't told me what he looks like. Is he tall? Yes. How old? – Isn't that Patrick? – It is. – Why didn't you tell me he was here? –He wasn't. – I wish you'd kept him away. – He wasn't here before! Good afternoon. I'm Jean-Paul Mantegna. Henri Vogel. – I was expecting you next week. – I'm a bit early. Let's set you up in my office. – I don't need much space. – I'm not gonna put you in a closet! Wanting to lock me in a closet usually comes later. Bernard will take you. Let me greet this gentleman. I'll catch up with you. – Why are you here? – He wants to see you. – I'll come tomorrow. – You said that yesterday. – I'm busy! I'll come tonight. – No. Not tonight. Now. – How so? – I'll take you. He no longer trusts you. What is it to you? I introduced you. If things go wrong, it'll be my problem. – Can you wait five minutes? – Sure. I'll wait for you here. I apologize. The Paris headquarters hadn't told me you were coming. The liaison accounts, please. Otherwise I would have picked you up. Let's have dinner tomorrow. There's a good fish place nearby. Sure, why not? And daily account statements, please. He's a colleague of yours, in Toulon. – Pronto? – Philippe Montegna, per favore. – He isn't here. May I ask who's calling? – His brother Jean-Paul. – When will he be back? – Tomorrow morning. Can you tell him I called? No. Tell him I must see him tomorrow. – I didn't know you had a brother. – I have two. Tie up your hair. Good thing I saw you. Otherwise you'd be stuck here. That's your car, isn't it? I didn't want to block one of your guests. I didn't realize we'd be driving there together. I think the old man is right. You can't be trusted anymore. Why would you send Patrick to the hotel? What kind of methods are these? Did he break anything? Did he shove a guest? What are you complaining about, then? I sent him for you because you wouldn't come otherwise. I do you a favor and you run away like a thief. What the hell are you doing? Well, for the past two weeks, you've been rushing me. That's because you start things but never finish them. You can't be trusted. I need another three months. So things get worse? – So I can finish the work. – With what money? Banks won't touch you. You owe me 300k plus six months of vig. You have no assets. And now you're gonna get fired because you stole and forged documents. Who told you? Bernard? I don't need him to find out. Come on, give me three months. Cash will flow in then. Cash doesn't "flow in!" I work hard. Monday through Saturday. Open your mouth. All day, teeth, tongues, throats. They reek of booze and cigarettes and God knows what. That's how cash flows in. Your nightclub... It's a jerk-off's dream. It's gonna work. I already have my staff. Legit people. Where are they, then? I don't see anyone with you. You look like a pretty lonely leader to me. I know it'll work out. You guys are always confident at first. It's not about confidence. It's about instinct. And your instinct is to chase tail. Business is much more complex. Too complex for you. I'm giving you three days because you're not drunk. You're lucky you don't drink. – Any calls? – The contractor, Mr. Sux. He expected you at the site at four. – Anything else? – No – Are they still here? – Yes. Are there any problems? Let me know if I can help. Thanks. You're nice. I waited for you. – I'm leaving again. – I'll join you. I won't be back until tomorrow. – You're working Wednesdays now? – I always did. Not on the weekends, though. Thanks. – Have you slept with her? – Yep. It's a nightclub, then? Where will the dancefloor be? Here. Downstairs, a 15 table restaurant. Big band on Saturdays. Dancing on other days. I'd asked Toni to take care of it. He'd agreed. Bar's over there. Are you stealing from the hotel now? Give it a rest! I had everything set up. Do you like it? It's hard to tell yet, but yeah, it's nice. Is the land yours? No, it belongs to the city. The father of a guy I know works at the prefecture. He got me the lease. What's on your mind? Nothing. Everything's slipping away because I'm a jerk-off. – Don't say that. – That's what everyone thinks. Even you think that. – I don't. – You just won't admit it. – It's not true. – Then you're dumber than I thought. That's charming. What's this relationship? You give me your ass. And I go for it to ignore how sad it is. Am I wrong? Tell me if I am. What do you expect from me? Where are you going? Fuck off. Viene da Francia, lui. I'm sorry, the meeting isn't over yet. – Would you like some more coffee? – Sure, thanks. – Have you been working here long? – One year. – Is my brother a good boss? – Yes, he is. Has he tried sleeping with you? – It's not your style. – Scusate Are you done? When you called yesterday... I thought it was because Dad had died. But you wouldn't have driven all this way to tell me that. He was sick this winter. He fell on the street. A stroke. I know. Francis called me. He needs to be tested every other month. What was the street where he fell? At the corner of rue Cassine. He's lucky to have you. What does he want? He doesn't want anything. Are you still in the food delivery industry? Hospitality. I work for a big chain on the coast. Ok. And? I need money. 300 grand. 300 is a lot. For me it is. For me too. It's not a sum that lies around in a drawer. And I'm not sure it would be doing you a favor. I'm in deep shit, Philippe. I don't doubt it. But I don't have 300 grand. – You mean you don't have them for me. – If you prefer. Why would I lend them to you. We haven't spoken in 10 years. Did you think I'd cut you a check, smile, and tell you 'No hard feelings'? No, I didn't. Then why did you come? Pretty wife. Pretty boat. Is she doing well? She's doing great. She's away in Sicily. Put this down. No... a souvenir... Put it down. You don't look like a happy man. Let's not kiss goodbye. I can give you 50,000 francs if you want. Jean-Paul! Don't you want to talk to me? I do. I was there when you called. Would you have come see me? No. I'm glad I took the lead, then. How bad are your troubles? Not as bad as seeing you again. Due martini I saw you once or twice in Nice. How often do you come? From time to time. You let your hair grow. – Do you not like it? – I do. You're pretty. You're well dressed. Aren't you scared? No, I'm not afraid of that. It's so long ago. It's obscene, seeing each other again. But it's nice. It makes me happy. – Obscene? – Yes. Obscene. A woman who loved a man and sees him again ten years later is obscene. What about a man who loved a woman? I don't know. Are you remarried? No. – Is your father doing better? – He is. I'd love to see him again. Has he changed much? He has. Can I call you if I'm ever in Nice? You're laughing. Yes, I'm laughing. Good evening. Weren't we supposed to eat together? I don't really have time. I tried letting you know. Don't you want something hot? No, this is great. The wine's good. Yes, I buy it from the vineyard. Your employees like you, Mr. Mantegna. I'll leave you alone. By the way, the hotel's check book that you sign Yes, Bernard gave it to you. – Yes. Isn't there another one? – No. Are you unwell? It's the second time I've puked since this morning. He just asks questions. He's like a Sphynx. He's looking for this. What should I do? Do what's best for you. Hi Jean-Paul. Bruno here. I can't make the game Sunday. You'll have to play goalkeeper. I let the others know. Jean-Paul? It's Anna Maria. It was nice seeing you again. I have to be in Nice. We could see each other, if you'd like. Saturday, around 3:00pm at the Royal. Love you. Hi Francis, Jean-Paul here. Am I waking you up? I tried calling you earlier. I was in Martigues. Can I come see you tomorrow morning? – I teach at 8:00am. – How about earlier? – What's going on? – I'll tell you tomorrow. Love you. See you tomorrow. – Good morning. I'm Jean-Paul. – Richard. Come in. – Your brother's here. – Coming! – Come on in. Would you like coffee? – That would be nice, thanks. – Did you drive at night? – I did. – How long? – Two months. I went to Milan to see Philippe yesterday. Did you ask him for money? Did you ask for money? Yep. He told me to fuck off. He always lacked a sense of humor. Did you see Anna Maria? No. You hadn't told me you'd called him. Do I have to go through you? Your coffee's too weak. He just could have called dad directly. He could let go. It was so long ago. Let go of what? I'll tell you later. What do you think of my brother? He's handsome. He likes mature men. Don't have your hopes up. He likes women. Birth defect. He's on a roll. Did you see dad recently? Yesterday. No, the day before. He's fine. He wants to go home. He's unhappy there. I'm not sorry for him. – I thought your dad was dead. – Yep. On my good days I tell the story of his funeral. – What did he do to you? – I wasn't the eldest he expected. Here. I wasn't sure I'd see you. You're lucky it's early in the month. 5,000 francs. Teachers don't make much. Thanks. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Things are hard these days and I may have been overly ambitious. No need to explain. It's me. She's coming down. Jean-Paul? I'm having friends over. Could I borrow flatware from the hotel? With nice glasses. I promise I won't break anything. Sure, I'll bring some. How are you? – Why won't she let me upstairs? – Because it's untidy. Are we going to the beach? No, it's too late right now. Dad, come eat! It's getting cold. Do you want the anchovy? Writing an accident report in Italian... Everyone has to pay their insurance premium. It's the law of large numbers. We always lose with you guys. You're exaggerating. But we are a for profit business. Like any business. That's my point. For you to make money someone has to lose money. I need to talk to you. Just give me a minute of your time. Do you mind? Thanks. They say the accident took place on the access ramp. But we know it's untrue. We have a witness. – Wait. – My dad was already... Ask them to pull out your file. Over there, at the end of the hall. Are you interested in a life insurance? No, I just picked it up to look. I can offer you a few advantageous options. It's a misunderstood product. It comes with lots of perks. We can talk about it whenever you want. Ok. Medical history. Mantegna Raphaël. Good. You'll be the beneficiary. 300,000 francs. I see your check for the first quarterly installment. Everything's in order. Why did your dad pick us? He lives in Nice, doesn't he? I often walk past your agency. It's also easier to park in Antibes. Do we send the contract to the address on file? No, I'll pick it up myself. My dad's going on a trip. – How long until its' ready? – Roughly two weeks. – Can I get an affidavit? – Of course. Evelyne, I'm going to need your help. In any case, your dad is insured as of today. I knew a Mantegna in Menton. Is he a relative? No. – I made it strong. – Thanks. What time do they pick up trash here? Around four or five in the morning. Did you get the job, Moussad? Yes, thanks. Your friend really helped. I'm starting at the end of the month. God willing. Inch'allah. Inch'allah. – What's that. – It's collateral. – I don't want any paperwork between us. – There won't be. It's just collateral. If my dad dies, I'll get this sum. When will your dad die? How old is he? He's old. Some old people won't die. He just had a stroke. So you're hoping he doesn't have long. That's not what I said. The collateral's here so you be patient. I don't want anything else. I only need three months. That's a photocopy. It's not worth shit. – He has the original. – Sure. Couldn't you ask for it? No really. It'd be awkward. This isn't classy on your part. He's the one who signed up for the insurance? For you? – Yes. – So he likes you? Four years ago. What if you can't pay me back in three months? – I will. – What if you can't? – Not an option. – What if you can't? Then I'll take care of my dad. Is that what you wanted me to say? So what? You'll take him for a walk on the cornice. You're nuts. – Son? Is that you? – Yep. – I brought you olives. – That's nice of you. – You didn't come yesterday. – I couldn't. – How are you doing? – Good, and you? – Your hair's looking long. – Really? Let me cut them. You look a bit unkempt. Not too much, then. Sit down. It's been a while since you've cut my hair. I started with Francis, then you. Then Philippe. You'd have us sit in the kitchen on Sunday mornings. Philippe's starting to lose his. – How did you learn? – Back home, in my village. We couldn't afford wasting money on hairdressers. Does Francis live alone? Does he? No. – Don't you want to see them again? – They're the ones who won't see me. Did you cut Mom's hair, too? Your mom's? No, not hers. You don't like talking about her, do you? I don't even have a picture of us. Of you and me, yes, but not with her. They're lost. It's as if I didn't know her. I appreciate you bringing olives. I like flowers, but they make a room like this, feels like a hospital. Did you see the doctor? I called him. They want to keep you here a couple more days. Three days? Done. It looks better now. Look yourself in the mirror. I looked for you on the terrasse. Are you hiding? Would you rather be outside? Are you looking for someone? – Where's your driver? – I came by train. – Anything wrong? – I'm fine. You don't want to walk. You don't want to sit. What do you want to do? I booked a room. Why have you come here? Are you bored in Milan? Is this some kind of off season tourism trip? You're lucky. The weather's nice. I always knew we'd see each other again. Then it took you too long. I'd like you to accept this. It's five million liras. – Are they his or yours? – They're mine. I mean, mine... I sold a piece of jewelry. You're divesting yourself. I don't want you to be in trouble. Also... I don't particularly like money. Money likes you, though. It follows you everywhere. Your clothes, your luggage, your perfume. What are you doing? Since you're paying... Do you remember? When we went to hotels together. Not hotels like this one. Or at your dad's. Anna Maria. Our lives are different. I'm not asking you to stay with me. He'll come find you. Probably. He'll cry. But he'll go home without me. Do you hate him? I don't want him to make me ashamed anymore. The whore who splits brothers apart. Families say that. So you came for him, then. Not for me. I won't come back. You're forgetting something. You'd take it from a man. Thank you. Your brother called from Marseille. He'll be on Monday's 12:00pm train. Thanks. Thank you. I didn't think I'd see you tonight. You have your routine. Kindly hand over your keys. This is my house key. Thanks. You're a charming, dynamic man, Mr. Mantegna. But you use the hotel's funds as your own... Everyone does that. I always paid the hotel back. Irregularities. Forged documents... You know what I'm talking about. Given the hotel's healthy profits under your stewardship, we won't sue. A new director will take over by the end of the month. I'll be in Nice for another day or two. If I don't see you again, best of luck. 15 shots, 5 goals. – What happened to you? – Didn't you see? The ball hit my shoulder. I got hurt. I gotta go. Anything wrong? All good. Aren't you staying for dessert? – Who's the lucky lady? Do we know her? – Tell us! Unless it's one of our wives... I'm gonna see my dad in his recovery home. Call us if you need backup. Here. Give him this. It includes the vig. What happened to you? – I injured myself at soccer. – Is it serious? Nah. I pulled a muscle. I was playing goalie. – Do you want me to drive? – No. Where are we going? On the cornice? Via the Turbie? Not today. The weather's going to shift. – Am I not allowed a cigarette? – Help yourself! Let's go buy some. It's good. We used to live here. Number 28. On this street? I thought we already owned the house when I was born. No. It wasn't fully built yet. We went there when your mother fell ill. Before that, we lived here. I'd just arrived from Italy. I couldn't be picky. – Let me pay. – Nope, it's on me. – Should I to take you back? – Are you in a rush? No. I'd like to go to the building site. I haven't been in two months. If you want. They didn't work yesterday. Nor the previous day. Nobody's worked here in at least two days. Come on, it's almost nighttime. This concrete is dry. I know the kind. You must be behind their backs, or they bullshit you. – Who removed the site's sign. – Don't know, the wind? Why didn't you listen? I told you to use oak for the framing. – All this imported wood. – It was cheaper. Come on, let's go! It's cheaper... All those forests burning each year. Yet importing's cheaper. Three sawmills are going out of business this year Back then, you could choose the kind of cut. 25 centimeters. That's what we'd used for Massol. He didn't want it at first. He thanked me later. His son took over the business... When are you opening? What about the girders? Will you use them all the way? How deep is it here? Fifty, maybe? If you don't lay deep foundations you'll be gathering all the bay's shit. You can't afford to open late. You'll work four months a year, max. Jean-Paul! Jean-Paul! Jean-Paul! Are you okay? Nothing broken? How's your heart? Take me home. – Do you want me to go up with you? – No. See you tomorrow. – Good evening. – Good evening. Is Madame Mantegna still here? Did Madame Mantegna keep her room? Yes. Do you want me to call her? You can also leave a message. You think I'm holding a grudge, don't you? May I? What are you drinking? Champagne? Two champagne, one pastis. I'm not angry at you, you know? I don't care about the hotel. "Irregularities," you said. So what? Everyone forges documents. Haven't you? – No. – You're an honest man, then. He's an honest man. So honest, in fact... Thanks. Cheers! So honest that your johnson's bored. So you bring it here to have fun. It's bored, all alone at night. So you're going to introduce it to this lady, who'll pretend to love you and so will you. Isn't that forgery? See, you're a forger too. You're drunk. Go to bed. Go to bed? Do you feel like sleeping? Everything's fake. Everything I touch is fake. Fake wood, fake leather. That guy over there's fake too? Ain't I right? You're right. You're not better than I, after all. Say it. I'm not better than you. To you I can tell. I've done worse. I bought insurance for my dad. I forged the papers. I thought of killing him. Now, that is true. It's the only true thing. You didn't kill him, though. No. That's what matters. For you, maybe. Everyone thinks of killing their dad. That's different. Different. You don't understand. He's gone. He left last night. What do you mean? He was supposed to stay another few days. He took everything with him. His suitcase. – Did he say anything? – Nothing. Just that he could no longer stay. Thank you. – How are you? – Good. You? – Yep. – Give it to me. The hotel told me you'd called. I found 10 grand for you. You don't look good. Are you okay? Where are we going? Hmm? – Are you coming? – No interest in seeing this asshole. Dad? Dad? He's not here. He left half an hour ago. Why didn't he open? – Are you sure he was here? – Certain. How long has he been living here? Seven years. When it's too hot in the summer he lives with me. That's an immigrant's bathroom. What does he look like now? – With young Juliette? – Julie. Julie. Still with the hats. – You didn't get into a fight, did you? – No. There must be a reason. Are you accusing me of something? I'm not accusing you. I'm the one breaking my back for him every day. He didn't open to bug me. Or something else. I don't know! That's old people for you. Sorry. Maybe he went shopping? – With his suitcase? – He took a suitcase? Yeah. I don't see the one he had at the hospital. There's probably money somewhere. I don't know. Check if he brought some with him. What did he do with the boxing stuff? It used to be all over the walls. I think he put it in the closet. Don't mess it up, though. Francis. So, did he bring cash with him? Yes, I think so. – Where was that? – Don't you remember? Sanary, July 63. First time I jacked off. Do you remember when he organized bouts? No, I was too young. Where was it? I'm not sure. On his work sites, I think. In warehouses. I remember this one. Calendria. Hot guy. – Why did he stop? – I don't remember. – Officials put an end to it. – Didn't someone die? – How do you know about this? – Someone told me at school. I'd gotten into a fight over it. Let's tidy up and scram. Imagine if he showed up and found me here. Leave the wine glasses for Marie-Jeanne. What brings you here? You? You! Odette. I haven't seen you in so long! You don't visit. You don't write. Even Philippe sends me holiday cards. Still unmarried? When will you make up your mind? A handsome man like you... I have a fiancé! His name's Richard. Richard Palestro. And you find this funny. You should see your face. When you were a child you always wanted to come in my bed. It's your fault. You ruined me for women. – Have you seen Raphaël? – No. He left the hospital yesterday. – He wouldn't open this morning. – Why didn't he? Is that why you came from Marseille? No. Don't worry about him. Raphaël's got a personality of his own. – Are you staying in Nice for a bit? – No. I'm going to spend time with you. Let me help you. – No need. – We have lots to tell each other! When that guy died, he feared he'd be held responsible and sent back to Italy. He didn't kill him. Why would he be held responsible? He didn't have French citizenship at the time. – How did he die? – I don't know. A bad punch as it sometimes happens. – Do you remember his name? – No. I've forgotten all this. Your mom was the one I knew back then. I didn't know Raphaël. Wasn't his name Massimo Simoni? Maybe. I don't know. I remember Raphaël brought the body back to Italy. They came from the same village. He suffered a lot because of this. It's best to let these things lie. Let me get dessert. Do you still like île flottante? I do. – Can you drop me off? – Sure. We'll catch up at your place. Francis. I wouldn't have recognized him. They're looking for you. He's fit. Still looks young. Such a nice boy. Don't smoke, you'll burn the bed spread. The doctor told you not to smoke but you won't listen. Why look at your sons from this hole? You'll end up all alone. I am alone. Jean-Paul mentioned Simoni. – What did you tell him? – Nothing. Don't worry. What time does the bus come? Where are you going? You're tired! Raphaël! I don't want to talk to you anymore. – Where is she? – No idea. – I know she's here. – I swear to you she isn't. I don't believe you. You saw her again in Milan. She told me. – Why did you see her again? – Because she so pleased. Come in and check if she's here. What did you tell her? Nothing. So you're using your dick to get back at me, asshole? I won't let it start over. Why are you always in my way? Don't touch me. – Do you know where she is? – Even if I knew... Let go of him, Philippe. Here, give him this. – Do you want to drink something? – Sure, I'll have what you have. If you're gonna go at it again, you might as well eat before. I have the 300k for you if you want. You take them, and you don't see her again. 300k. Is that how much she's worth to you? I don't give a fuck about your money. Things aren't getting any better between you two. Where are you going to spend the night? There's a nice little hotel down the street. Or maybe he can go to yours. Nah, it's not good enough for him. They fired me anyway. Richard? I won't come home tonight. Are you here? Are you falling asleep? Go, go into the night! I'm in a very masculine atmosphere. Very violent. Nah, I'm with my brothers. I'll call you back tomorrow. Love you. Are you careful at least? No, I fuck without condoms and I never get tested. Don't you wish you had kids? Sometimes, lately. What about you? I drank too much. Has she left you often? She's come back. I'm not crazy. I know she needs me. I think she does. The two of you used to share girls. We were 20 years old back then. What should we do about Raphaël? Let the son deal with it. Why did you steal those? I don't understand everything. Can you? Wake him up, I can't stand the sight of the living room. He hasn't grown up. He still calls after his mother in his sleep. – Did you call his place again. – No one's home. – Hospitals? – He's in none of them. Bring him his coffee. He'll give you a tip. Does he at least have a morning stiffy? Have you seen my dad? When's the last time Mantegna was here? A week ago, maybe? Do you like him? Raphaël? – Who? – The guy from Astanazzo. Your dad's an impatient man. He makes us laugh with his stories. I'm glad he makes someone laugh. That's what his life is like. Coffee. A small restaurant. A small card game. What did you think his life was like? Last year I took him to Morocco. After two days he wanted to go home. He didn't want to visit anything. – If I'd taken care of him... – He'd have gotten old all the same. He isn't interested in anything. People like him lose it once they stop working. – Was he seeing any women? – I don't think so. He's not at Odette's. – Could he be at another woman's? – Do you want to tour the whorehouses? Another one, please. I feel as though you knew we wouldn't find him here. – Why would you say that? – An impression. When did you last see him? – On Sunday. – What did you guys do? As usual, we went for a ride. – Was he okay? – Yes! Go ahead, yell. You'll feel better. You almost lost your balance. I haven't seen him in a month, at least. I call him when I have a good fighter. That kid over there is good, huh? He won't disappoint tonight. Go on. Your left. Your left! Come on. Jab. Jab. Never the right. You're still short on light bulbs... – You've fought bouts, haven't you? –Two. Won one, lost one. Always behind you, your dad. He always had me fight older kids. I always got my ass kicked. That's how you learn! You guys didn't get that. Nope. Why didn't we? He got scared. One day I was out for a full minute. Only those who know hunger can box. It's an immigrant's sport. Back in my day, it was for the Italians. Now it's for Arabs. Where's the bathroom? Hi there. Did you know a boxer named Simoni? Yes. We started together. How did he die? You're good. He was a skilled boxer, Simoni. He'd gone back to Italy. He'd said in a letter that he no longer wanted to box. But your dad had gotten mixed up with betting. Another club from Toulon was involved. So Simoni came back. He needed money. We all did. But... The guy who showed up was far heavier. Simoni got hit in the temple. He fell like a log, and it was over. He was 24. He'd just had a baby. It wasn't your dad's fault. Let's go. It reeks in here. Mantegna. Raphaël. Date of birth? January 1925. – Height? – Medium. – Eyes? – Black. Grey hair. Any distinguishing feature? He had his gall bladder removed. Do you have a picture of the missing person? No. What was he wearing? An overcoat, I think. When did you last see him? Ten years ago. They haven't found an old man's body in any ditch. There you go, kiddo. This park's funny. In a little while, the kids and pregnant women will leave. And if things haven't changed, it'll soon teem with people fucking in the bushes. Men, that is. Men blowing each other, fucking each other. Orgies. Who are you trying to upset, here? It's not upsetting. It's nature. When I was 17, I came here. Raphaël found out and wasn't pleased. You can't ask a father to understand that kind of stuff. Sure. One night he came. He hid over there. And he whistled. I couldn't see who it was. When I got there I recognized his coat. It was too late. He started hitting me. One slap after another. With his signet ring on. I was so ashamed I pissed myself. He screamed: "Do you need help, wanker?" He yelled so hard everyone ran away. I wonder why I'm running around town looking for an old bastard like him. Francis, that's enough. He took me to whorehouses to cure me. All he taught me was shame. What about you two? Why are you here? You, you're hiding something. And you're tagging along in case he's not fucking your wife. Fuck off. You don't give a shit about your dad. You no longer see him because you're ashamed of him. Let go of me. Because he's a poor, ignorant, Italian immigrant. Because in your world, he looks out of place. Not presentable enough. Let him die in peace. – Francis! – Leave me alone. What, man? Do you like dick? Those are things you want to forget. Sadly, we succeed in forgetting them. At my wedding, Anna Maria's uncle and aunt thought he was help. They gave him their coats. I was next to him. He looked at me and I said nothing. Raphaël didn't say anything either. He looked down. And I saw him walk away with the coats under his arm. Did you know? What are you gonna do? Can I sleep at your place? I have a plane in the morning. You can read Italian, can't you? I don't understand everything. Letters from Pantedo. One from that guy, Simoni. He says he's tired and doesn't want to box anymore. That part he didn't write. Someone named Lea did. His mom, I think. She sends back money orders. "I don't want money." She mentions a child. That part I don't understand. It's dialect from Piemont. Does Raphaël know you have these letters? No. I need an hour alone. We went to school around here. Aren't you drinking your pastis? I see you now smoke Gitanes... Raphaël came here and you didn't tell us. I love you guys, but not as much as I love him. Sorry. That's how it is. He left. I don't know where he went. Why do you protect him like this? He didn't marry you. He didn't respect you. You took care of us for free for 15 years. You didn't even sit at the table when there were people over. – He slept with anyone who wore a skirt. – I don't care. That's our business. Not many women received what he gave me. What happened to Massimo Simoni's child? I don't know. Leave me alone now, I need to go to work. What are these letters? There's a picture, returned money orders. I don't read Italian. Give them to me. Raphaël was responsible for the death. He made the guy come back from Italy. He raised the ante. What did he do for the kid, then? Did he go to school? What did you do for him? We did something for him. Raphaël went to get him in Pontedo. We raised him. Loved him. What difference does it make? – Here. – Thanks. – Where are you from? – From Annemasse. In the Alps. Do you often visit your folks? No. I don't get along with my dad. He'd like me to work. And you don't like it. Last year I was a nougat door to door salesman. As I told my dad, don't ask a fountain to make wine. – Are you trying to get me drunk? – Yep. Another one, please. Give me the letter. I'll read it to you. Let's not worry about these old stories. – Do you know her? – I do. Her name is Mireille. But she goes as Chloé. – Do you live in Nice? – He doesn't. He lives in Milan. You don't look alike. The mouth, maybe. On foot? I told you I'd leave keys in the mailbox. I forgot. – Chloé, this is my brother, Francis. – Good evening. How many of you are there? Your geranium is withering. I told you it needs a lot of water. Is the older brother from Milan too? You always got first dibs. They seem to fancy you quite a bit. – Both of them. – I know. I don't mind. Which one do you prefer? The first one I'll run into. Come with me. Lively woman... – What's her name? – Chloé. Well, Chloé... – Do you want me to unfold the sofa? – No, I'll do it. Francis, what's your oldest memory? Why are you asking me this? When they put me in sea water for the first time, I think. What about my birth? Do you remember it? No. I don't. One day, you were just there. What do you want to tell me? You knew. I think I always knew without anyone ever telling me. What difference does it make? Nothing at all. I'm the son of a dead boxer and a 16-year-old girl who vanished. That's it. You're the one he loved. More than he loved us. It made us jealous. So don't bug us. Do you wanna know what the favorite son did on Sunday? I almost let him die. With his hat, his idiot face and his messed up heart. I wanted to kill him. I don't even know why. It just happened. That's why he left. He doesn't want to see me anymore. Don't you have anything to say? Doesn't it make you sick that I wanted to kill your dad? No. He took a bad hit, but he'll be fine. Thanks. We haven't seen each other in a while. I apologize. Sometimes, we don't know... what's going through our minds. He's okay. Once... Once, when you were 13 I took you to the Turbie cliff. In the old Simca. Do you remember? Yes. I tried telling you. I couldn't. I'm not like you guys. I don't know how to talk. Let's go home.
