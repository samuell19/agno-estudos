[chiming] She's coming down. - [woman] William. - Yes, ma'am? Has my daughter-in-law telephoned? Mrs. Lisa phoned. She'll be here at 4:00, ma'am. It's 4:00 now. We'll be pouring tea in the drawing room this afternoon. Very good, ma'am. - Mrs. Lisa is bringing someone with her. - Yes, ma'am. - Show them in here. - Very good, ma'am. Please tell Miss Charlotte to be down in ten minutes. Yes, ma'am. How many times must I tell you not to have the table here at this time of day? - Sorry, ma'am. - [tapping] What's that noise? Whoever is doing that will kindly stop. I imagine whoever said that... Yes, that's Mother. I'll go ahead and smooth the path. Messy things, pipes. I like them. - Your coat, sir. - Oh, yes, yes. Thank you. - This way, please. - Thank you. But surely there can be no possible harm in just talking. I thought that... This is Dr. Jaquith. My mother-in-law, Mrs. Henry Windle Vale. How do you do? I will not pretend you've been brought here with my approval. No matter what Lisa may have told you, my daughter Charlotte is no more ill than a molting canary. Well, that's what we hope he's come to confirm. Mother's disapproval isn't personal, Doctor. - Please sit down, won't you? - Thank you. The last member of your profession I consulted warned me my heart would be the finish of me. The fact I've outlived him for 15 years has not increased my meager trust of the pack of you. A highly sensible reaction. Well, darling, please try to relax your grim disapproval where this doctor is concerned. Really, we're honored by the visit of the foremost psychiatrist of the whole country. I think it was pretty sweet of him to come all the way from New York to Boston. Generally, he doesn't come to see people. They go to see him. Wouldn't hurt if you also added that that's from lack of time, not from vanity. And, Mother, before I forget it, please don't call him Dr. Jaquith in front of Charlotte. That's his name, isn't it? Well, yes, but forget the "Dr." Make it "Mr." Charlotte will shut up like a clam if she suspects we've trapped her into an examination. So please try to cooperate. I've already sent for Charlotte. My little girl will be here directly. Miss Charlotte. Your mother's waiting in the downstairs drawing room. [Mrs. Vale] Is it facts about my daughter you want or Lisa's fancies? [Jaquith] Just anything interesting. [Mrs. Vale] Charlotte was a late child. There were three boys, then after a long time, this girl. "A child of my old age," I've always called her. I was well into my 40s, and her father passed on soon after she was born. My ugly duckling. Of course it's true that all late children are marked. Often such children aren't wanted. That can mark them. I've kept her close by me always. When she was young, foolish, I made decisions for her. Always the right decisions. One would think a child would wish to repay a mother's love and kindness. There you are, Charlotte. I'm so glad to see you. Hello, dear. This is my very good friend, Mr. Jaquith. I ran into him on the street and brought him by for tea. I thought Mother would be pleased, and I hoped you would be too. How do you do, Miss Vale? Well? Has the cat got your tongue, Charlotte? I apologize for my daughter's bad manners, Doctor. Mother, please. I will not countenance deceit, Lisa, against one of my own flesh and blood. But neither will I countenance any more of Charlotte's nonsense. Lisa tells me that your latest peculiarities... your fits of crying, your secretiveness... indicate you're on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Is that what you're trying to achieve? Charlotte, dear, believe me, I was only trying to help you. Dr. Jaquith has a sanitarium in Vermont, I believe. Probably one of those places with a high wire fence and yowling inmates. Well, now, I wouldn't want anyone to have that mistaken notion. Cascade is just a place in the country. People come to it when they're tired. You go to the seashore. They come there. The very word "psychiatry," Dr. Jaquith... Doesn't it fill you with shame, my daughter, a member of our family? There's nothing shameful about my work or frightening or anything else. It's very simple, really, what I try to do. People come to a fork in the road. They're confused. They don't know which way to take. I just put up a signpost: "Not that way. This way." [Lisa] Really, Mother. [Jaquith] Excuse me. Miss Vale, please wait. Miss Vale, I wonder if I might ask you a favor. Would you be nice and show me around this house? One doesn't often get the chance. Yes, that's right, I had a look at the downstairs when I came in. There's nothing like these old Boston homes anywhere. Here on Marlborough Street or Beacon Hill, you see them standing in a row like bastions. Firm, proud, resisting the new. Houses turned in upon themselves, hugging their pride. Introverted, Doctor. I wouldn't know about that. I don't put much faith in scientific terms. I leave that to the fakers and the writers of books. That's the room where I was born. - My mother's room. - Fine room. Do you think so? Of course, I'd prefer to see what your room is like. Is it nearby? I'm not your patient yet, Doctor. Well, now, nobody thinks you ever will be. I've seen the rooms of lots of people who aren't my patients. My friends. Of course, if you don't want to... It's on the floor above. [steps creak] When I was 17, I came in once after midnight. That tread hasn't been fixed since. She locks her door, Doctor. Make a note of it. Significant, isn't it? Well, it signifies that it's your door. I never heard it said that a woman's home is not her castle. My castle, Doctor. You know, stuff like this was built to last a lifetime. - Solid. - Enduring and inescapable. Are you comfortable here? I try to be. I'm here a good part of the time. Why, what's this? Did you do these? Why shouldn't I? Well, the point is how you could. They're really professional. Do you mind if I look at them? No, I don't mind. They aren't very difficult. I get the raw ivory from New York, and I have the tools. It's just a matter of the doing. And the skill. You know, this is very good detail. I have a great admiration for people who are clever with their hands. I was always so clumsy with my own. I should think you were the least clumsy person I'd ever met. You know, this is excellent. You may have one if you like. - May I? Any one? - Of course. All except this one. When I was working on it, my mother sent for me. My chisel slipped. - A pity to ruin such a nice box. - Yes. - I'll get you something to wrap it in. - Oh, don't bother. Well, then any old piece of paper will do. You don't happen to have a cigarette hidden away someplace? I seem to have left my tobacco in my coat downstairs. Do you think I hide cigarettes in my room, Doctor? No. Where do I hide them, Doctor? On the shelves behind the books? Cigarettes and medicated sherry and books my mother won't allow me to read? A whole secret life hidden up here behind a locked door? Please. It was only the box that reminded me. How very perceiving you are, Doctor. How very right you are. And see, I was just about to hide this album. You really should read it. It's a shame for you to come all the way up here and miss your amusement. Read it, Doctor. The intimate journal of Miss Charlotte Vale, spinster. Won't anything convince you that I don't wish to pry? But you must pry. I insist that you do. There's really nothing to frighten you off. A few snapshots, a memento or two. It's a record of my last trip abroad with my mother. We were sailing up the coast of Africa. See? There's a picture of our ship, a P&O steamer. You wouldn't have known me then. I was 20 then. Oh, I say. That was a scorcher. Leslie, you act so funny. Do I? I thought that men didn't like girls who were prudes. You're gorgeous, Charlotte. Come on. Give us another. Eyes open. There's the first mate. They'll be looking for me. There's always a mess of work just before we dock. - Are you going ashore tonight? - Are we, pet? Darling, if I can't go, you won't, will you? Not even if that girl from New York does? [chuckles] Not likely. There's nothing like you to be found in all of Africa. There he is again. I'd better hop to it. - Leslie. - Yes? Come here. [kisses] Darling. Dearest darling. [Charlotte] I had read that part in novels, about men not liking girls to be prudes. That's all I had to go by, novels. Leslie told me he'd rather have me than any girl on board, or any girl he'd ever known, because I was so responsive. He said that the others were like silly schoolgirls compared to my lovemaking. Why aren't you wearing your glasses? They're in my bag. Mother, they're so unattractive. Other girls don't... Put them on. You'll never get another pair of eyes, my dear. What's that book? Marconi. Wireless. I'm studying it. From whom are you learning about wireless? Mr. Trotter lent me the book. - You mean the wireless officer? - Yes. Are we taking the shore trip tonight? No, I think not. Then could I go alone? I don't mean really alone. I ran into the ship's hostess, and she said they were organizing groups. I said I'd ask you. Could we try to remember that we're hardly commercial travelers? It's bad enough to have to associate with these tourists on board without having to go ashore with them. You have all the vigor of a typical American tourist. Charlotte, sit down and write something to someone. The last three days, you've been behaving like an excited servant girl. [Charlotte] That night I left her in her room with one of her headaches. I would go to the library and read. And later when she looked for me, I wasn't there. She couldn't know I was with Leslie, but she knew I hadnâ€™t gone ashore. She'd checked on that. Leslie and I always had to be discreet, not only because of Mother, but because of his position on the ship as well. One of our favorite trysting places was on the freight deck among the crates and canvas-covered automobiles. There was a particular limousine. - Come out at once. - [captain] Trotter. I don't care. I'm glad. Go to your cabin. I want to marry your daughter. We're engaged to be married. Do you allow your officers to address a passenger in that manner? Report to my quarters at once, Trotter. Go to your cabin. [Charlotte] I had said I was glad, and I was glad. He had defied my mother and placed me on a throne. And before a witness too. It was the proudest moment of my life. My moment didn't last long, as you can see. My mother didn't think that Leslie was suitable for a Vale of Boston. What man is suitable, Doctor? She's never found one. What man would ever look at me and say, "I want you"? I'm fat. My mother doesn't approve of dieting. Look at my shoes. My mother approves of sensible shoes. Look at the books on my shelves. My mother approves of good, solid books. I'm my mother's well-loved daughter. I'm her companion. I'm my mother's servant. My mother says. My mother! My mother! My mother! [weeping] You'll never get another pair of eyes, as your mother says, if you spoil them with tears. [sobs] Dr. Jaquith... can you help me? Help you? When you were talking downstairs... when you were talking about the fork in the road... there are other forks further along the road. So many. [sobs] You don't need my help. Here are your glasses. Put away your book, and come downstairs. I'll go ahead. Thank you again for this. [sobs] Well, it's as I said, isn't it? Just nonsense. She is most seriously ill. - Charlotte is? - Thanks to you. - Did you sayâ€” - My dear Mrs. Vale, if you had deliberately and maliciously planned to destroy your daughter's life, you couldn't have done it more completely. How? By exercising a mother's rights? A mother's rights? Twaddle. A child has rights. A person has rights to discover her own mistakes, to make her own way, to grow and blossom in her own particular soil. Are we getting into botany, Doctor? Are we flowers? [door opens] - Hello, William. Gloomy William. - Good afternoon, Miss June. I've been thinking. You should get yourself a top piece. One like Mrs. Vincent Adams has put on her Charles. It's a project worth considering. - I myself have been worried â€” - Black, I think, or... Well, maybe red. Anyway, we'll think about it. Oh, hello, Aunt Charlotte. - Hello, June. - You look ravishing. New dress? No, June. Well, anyway, it's devastating. Aunt Charlotte, do you think even at our age, we should wear our skirts so short? - June, mind your manners. - Hello, Grandma. - Why are you always late? - I'm sorry. - Charlotte, will you pour tea? - Hello, dear. Will you have tea with us? Tea? I'm heading for cocktails later. - Who's this? - This is Dr. Jaquith. And I'm June. You've heard about us, June and December? My infant. What's that? - Don't tell me Charlotte gave it to you. - [Lisa] June. One of her own precious, private... Why, Aunt Charlotte, fess up. A romance? Isn't this something to be discussed with the family? [Lisa] June, will you please... - What's this? A hangover, I believe it is. - [cup rattling] Aunt Charlotte's got the shakes. [gasps] Go on, torture me. Go on, torture me. You like making fun of me, don't you? You think it's fun making fun of me, don't you? I... - Nice work, infant. - I didn't mean... We've always ragged Aunt Charlotte. It's just a game. A nervous breakdown. No member of the Vale family has ever had a nervous breakdown. Well, there's one having one now. I suggest a few weeks at Cascade. There you are, Lisa. - I've been waiting for you. - Hello. You're looking lovelier than ever. Good to see you again. Sorry I'm late. We lost our way a bit. - Tell me, how is Charlotte? - Better every week. In fact, she's almost well, but she doesn't believe it. The prospect still looks dark to her. Going through a sickness like hers is like going through a tunnel. It's pretty dark right up to the last few hundred yards. You'll find her feeling depressed today because this morning, - I told her she's a fledgling now. - A fledgling? Well, it's time for her to get out of the nest and try her own wings. Contemplation of going home has struck her pretty hard. I haven't told her there's any alternative. - Then you think well of my alternative? - It's a gift from heaven. But we won't tell her about it till you've gone. Now, don't expect to find her looking well. She's lost a lot of weight. She's a pretty sick girl. Charlotte, darling. I'm so glad to see you. Dr. Jaquith says you're much better, almost well. Yes, that's what he says. Lisa, this is Miss Trask. Mrs. Vale. - [both] How do you do? - Miss Trask is chief of my police force. - [chuckles] - What's this? I've been helping Miss Vale with her weaving. Now you've come, if you'll excuse me, I have a million things to do. The oculist told you you don't need these anymore. But I feel so undressed without them. It's good for you to feel that way. - How's Mother? - Fine. She's having a wonderful time paying visits to all her children. Spending a month with me at present. - Has Dr. Jaquith told you? - Told me what? He says I'm well enough to leave here now. I've got to go home. Lisa, I dread it so terribly. I know it's awful not to want to see Mother, and it's wrong... Stop, look, and listen. New England conscience on the track. Perhaps you don't have to go home. Mayn't I tell her? Later, maybe. We'll see how she behaves. We have a scheme, your relative and I. - What is it? - I'm not telling you yet. Marvelous chance, though, to use your re-education. Well, my time for pleasure is just about up. I thought I'd show Lisa around the place a little. You can show her the rest of the works when we get back. Meet me outside in a minute? Oh, I've been thrown out of better places than this, Doctor. This morning during your office appointment, I referred to a quotation, remember? Oh, yes, Walt Whitman's. I had it looked up and typed out on a slip of paper for you. If old Walt didn't have you in mind when he wrote this, he had lots of others like you. He's put into words what I'd like to say to you now, and far better than I could ever express it. Read it. Bye. [Charlotte] Bye. "Untold want, by life and land Ne'er granted Now, voyager, sail thou forth To seek and find." [horn blows] Don't worry. We'll be on our way soon. Mr. Thompson, the others have all gone. This is the last tender. Don't be impatient. We'll all be ashore in a minute. - What are we waiting for? - Miss Beauchamp. She said... She hasn't stuck her nose out of her cabin since we left New York. I caught a glimpse of her once. Just a glimpse. I think she's been ill. She looks pale, but interesting. She'd be much more interesting if she wouldn't hold us up. Shh. Here she is. Miss Beauchamp, here you are. We've been waiting for you. I'm sorry. Miss Beauchamp. Miss Beauchamp. - Allow me to introduce Mr. Durrance. - How do you do? [Thompson] I've been checking over our shore vehicles, and there's only one left. Would you be so kind as to share your carriage with this gentleman? Well, really... That's splendid of you, Miss Beauchamp. Splendid. You're traveling alone, and he's traveling alone, and so that's splendid. Splendid. [clears throat] I know it's an inconvenience. If it's too much, just say so. Now, pull your own weight. I've taught you the technique. Use it. Forget you're a hidebound New Englander and unbend. Take part, contribute. Be interested in everything... and everybody. You sure you don't mind? Of course not. I should be able to stand it if you can. Are you a typical tourist? I am. Not that you wouldn't know. But it's foolish not to be if you're going to see something you haven't seen before. I want to see everything. The Queen's Staircase... Why are you smiling? I was thinking of my mother. Your mother? Could we try to remember that we're hardly commercial travelers? It's bad enough to have to associate with these tourists on board. I'll be glad to see anything you like. Thank you. You're a good sport. - Is it all right? - Yes, thank you. Excellent. Good. Will you excuse me long enough to send a cable? I promised my wife. I should have sent it this morning. Isobel gets nervous. Of course. You must send it at once. Here, while I'm gone. I wish I understood you. Since we just met this morning, how could you possibly? Well, I won't be long. He wishes he understood me. He wishes. Well, that's done. Miss Beauchamp, I've taken the liberty of ordering us Cointreaus. You know, you're quite different from what I expected. How? You're so much more comfortable to talk to, Miss Beauchamp... Please listen. I'm not Miss Beauchamp. Renee is in Arizona somewhere. - But this morning, the cruise manager â€” - I know. The head waiter and the deck steward, they all think I'm Miss Beauchamp. The purser knows I'm not. I took Renee's space at the last moment. It was too late for my name to go on the first passenger list. Do you intend to keep your identity a dark secret for the whole voyage? No, I would've corrected the mistake earlier, only there was such a crowd, it would've been awkward. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. A stranger. I'm awfully sorry. My name is Durrance. Jeremiah Duveaux Durrance. [chuckles] Silly name, isn't it? My father named me after a professor he was fond of. I was J.D. in college, and my wife calls me J. Duveaux, but I'm Jerry to my friends. And now, won't you tell me who you are? My name is Vale, V-A-L-E. If it ever appears on the passenger list, it will be: "C. Vale, Boston, Massachusetts." Are you one of the Vales of Boston? One of the lesser ones. Well, which one? I don't even know yet whether it's Miss or Mrs. It's Aunt. Every family has one, you know. But Aunt what? My name is Charlotte Vale. Miss Charlotte Vale. Please, let's go. Miss Vale, I hope I didn't offend you. It's like me to blunder when I was going to ask you for a favor this afternoon. I have some shopping to do for my daughters. Well, I need a woman's help. Of course. A spinster aunt is an ideal person to select presents for young girls. I think you did darn well. The jewelry is just right for Beatrice. At 16, they get the urge for glamour. And a sweater for Tina. - How old is Tina? - Here, I'll show you. My harem. - Who is that knitting? - That's Isobel, my wife. The picture isn't very good of her. If she'd only looked up and smiled. - [chuckles] That's Beatrice next to her. - [chuckles] Yes. Then that must be Tina sitting cross-legged on the grass. We hope she won't have to wear glasses all her life. Tina wouldn't smile for me either. She's convinced she's an ugly duckling. Does Tina know she wasn't wanted? There's an odd remark. I don't know why I made it. I mean odd because it hits so close to the truth. Even before she was born, her mother said... But never mind that. Here is a slight offering. For being my guide today. It's a mixture of several kinds of flowers. It's called Jolies Fleurs. Thank you very much. - I'll put some on my handkerchief tonight. - Will you? Good. Let's meet in the bar for a cocktail before dinner. "Silver slippers and silver evening bag will be found in accessory closet." I suppose she thought I'd wear oxfords and carry a shopping bag. - I'm late, I know. - I hoped you hadn't changed your mind. What will you have? I'll leave that to you. What about bourbon old-fashioneds? Right. Will you have a cigarette? Thank you. You made a striking impression as you stood in the doorway looking for me. I've probably put on too much lipstick. Not that I'd notice. But I did notice your wrap at once. I don't pretend to know much, but I recognize the fritillaries when I see them. - Fritillaries? - The butterfly design on your coat. Butterflies are a hobby of mine, you know. Would you mind leaning forward? Those dark, slender lines coming over your shoulders must be antennae. - What's that? - What's what? Something on your coat. Why, it's pinned on. Somebody must have been playing a joke on you, I guess. Unpin it, please. This should pigeonhole me for you, all right. What does it mean? I can't make head or tail of it. It means that this cape belongs to Renee Beauchamp. She lent it to me. Oh, I see. Your wings are borrowed. Well, they suit you just the same. No, they don't. They don't suit me at all. In fact, they're perfectly ridiculous. You're quite right someone is playing a joke on me. - Only it's far funnier than you realize. - You aren't going, are you? Well, J.D. - Mac! And Deb too, as I'm alive. - Hi. These are my old friends Deb McIntyre and Frank. And my new friend Miss, uh, Beauchamp. How do you do? How do you do? I'm so happy to know you. Don't tell me this is the famous Beauchamp who does the imitations? No, another one altogether. This is, uh, Camille Beauchamp. Oh, well. Why don't we all go up to the club? We can have dinner, and we can dance. I don't dance. That lets me out too. I don't dance either, according to my daughters. - How are Isobel and the kids? - Fine, when I left. I thought you were in Buenos Aires. We liked it so well in Nassau we stayed over. What are you doing here? - Business. Going to Rio. - I'm glad we joined the cruise. - Well, we'll see you later, J.D. - Of course. Thanks. Wait a minute. Why did you run out on me like that? I'm tired. I think I'll have dinner in my cabin. Besides, you'll want to be with your friends. There's something more. Did you have to introduce me like that? It wasn't up to me to let the cat out of the bag. Did I do wrong? It doesn't make my situation on this cruise any easier, I should say. Then why didn't you stop me? Why did you call me Camille? Well, it was the only French name I could think of besides Fifi. That's meant to be funny? My wife calls my lighter moments "trying to be funny." So I don't blame you for feeling the same way. But I intended a compliment. In that dress, you're rather like a camellia. Likely. You haven't a very high opinion of yourself, have you? Perhaps this will help you know why. You showed me your album, I'll show you mine. - A picture of my family. - [laughs] Family is right. - Your grandmother? - No, my mother. A very strong character, I'd say. And these? - My brothers and their wives. - But they're so much older. Who's the fat lady with the heavy brows and all the hair? A spinster aunt. Where are you? Taking the picture? I'm the fat lady with the heavy brows and all the hair. I'm poor Aunt Charlotte, and I've been ill. I've been in a sanitarium for three months. And I'm not well yet, and I... [cries] [sobs] Forgive me. Feeling better? Much. Thanks to you. Many, many thanks to you. Thanks for what? For sharing my carriage today and for walking my legs off sightseeing and for lunch and for shopping and for helping me feel that there were a few moments when I... when I almost felt alive. Thank you. Thank you, who? - Thank you, Jerry. - [chuckles] I must go in now. Good night, Camille. Will you meet me for breakfast? - Yes. - Sleep well. Good night. [horn blows] - [passengers laughing] - [Deb] I give up. [man] You're no help. That gives you ten more. [Jerry] You won't make this one either. [sighs] I haven't heard Jerry laugh like that in years. - Really? - You're good for him. Mmm. I'm exhausted. Charlotte... how much has Jerry told you about his life at home? He told me he was married. He showed me a snapshot of his family. - He seemed very proud of them. - He would. Right out of the age of chivalry, that boy. Thank you. Charlotte? No, thank you. I can tell you there's not much joy in life for him at home. Honestly, when I see what a woman like Isobel can do to a man like Jerry, it makes me boil. He doesn't have to stand it, does he? The weak have great strength when they're clinging to something decent and fine. He's been cursed from the day he met Isobel by a passion not to hurt her. [scoffs] There must be something more. He married her. Propinquity, my dear, and propriety. Isobel was one of those pure, high-minded girls who believed that a kiss required a proposal of marriage. She's been about his neck ever since. He struggled along at his architecture to get together enough money. Then he had to give it up. Only thing he ever loved. Isobel kept reminding him he was now a married man with financial responsibilities. And almost immediately she found she was going to have a child. She considered herself a great martyr, and she's played the martyr since. That's her grasp on him. Her martyrdom and her jealousy. She can't have any reasons to be jealous. If you mean does Jerry have flings with other women? No. But mostly, she's jealous of Tina, the child she never wanted. Did you know that before Tina was born, Isobel actually went to a doctor and tried to get him to say her health wouldn't permit her to have a child. Yet if you could hear her sanctimonious maternal tone when she lets it leak out what a self-sacrificing mother she's been. - [ship horn blows] - What are you two so thick about? We're just being girls together. Who won? - Don't brag. - I won't. We're getting into the harbor. It's one of the few sights that doesn't disappoint you after the picture postcards. What was Deb saying? You know Deb. She was rattling on. I want to know. About me? Yes, she was telling me about your life at home. Oh. You mustn't miss this moment. There's only one first sailing into Rio Harbor. This is my getting-off place. Your boat goes on in three days. Will I see you? Not unless you pay more attention to your guide. Thank you. - There's Sugar Loaf. - Oh, yes, it is. Sugar Loaf. That stretch of sand to the left is Copacabana beach. Copacabana. There's music in the word. On that mountain, there's something to please your architect's heart. The Cristo statue. [engine sputtering] [sputtering continues] Serves me right for picking up a car just because I liked the driver's face instead of getting one from a regular tourist agency. Don't worry. It doesn't matter. But we promised Deb and Mack to meet them up there for dinner. How much farther is it? Giuseppe. Giuseppe! - Okay, mister. - Don't look, just listen. - How far is it? - Oh, banana trees. No, no. Distance, miles, kilometers. [speaks French, Spanish] [speaks Portuguese] - Parakeets, birds, parrots, rubber. - [Charlotte chuckles] Rubber. I thought the card said, "English-spoking driver." What he needs is a couple of Portuguese-spoking passengers. Jerry, sit back. He knows where he's going. Where are we going? This must be the shortcut I told you about. Past the old church I wanted to see. [engine sputtering] Are you sure this is the right way? I'll bet he hasn't any more idea than we have. I'll make him turn around. All you'll get is, "Okay, senhor" or "banana trees." - Giuseppe. - Mm-hmm? - Turn the car around. - Okay, senhor. I told you. Giuseppe. Stop. Turn around. Go back. Uh-uh, no good? Turn around. Go back. [speaks Portuguese] Yeah. Eh? I think so. Try it anyway. Okay, senhor. [Jerry] Stop! Take it easy. Go forward. Yes, yes, forward. - [engine rattles] - Forward. [crashes] [Giuseppe shouting in Portuguese] Mister, mister, please not be dead! Not be hurt. Not be killed! [speaks foreign language] Please, mister, not be dead! [cries] You all right? - I guess so. - Sure? Yes. [crying] Giuseppe, it's all right. Don't cry. - Don't cry, Giuseppe. - Look! [speaks Portuguese] I'll try. Giuseppe... Please, please, mister. [speaks Portuguese] You â€” [speaks Portuguese] Me â€” [speaks Portuguese] [imitates horse whinnying] All right. All right. What does he say? I think he means he's going to get a horse and a rope. Oh, no, no, no, Giuseppe. Not cavalo e corda. Not now. Giuseppe, go and get another automobile and chauffeur. Signorina must go Rio immediately. Catch big boat. - Boat. - Boat? Giuseppe, stay here when senhor and signorina go Rio, then Giuseppe get cavalo e corda and come Rio later. "Comprehendere"? [mutters] Jerry, haven't you got a piece paper? Draw it out for him. All right. Ah. Ah. Ah. What's the word for "tonight"? - Draw the face of a clock. - Oh, yeah. [Jerry] Tonight. Ah! - [speaks Portuguese] - [repeats Portuguese] Big boat. Go. Depart. [imitates swooshing] Pfft. Pfft. [speaks Portuguese] Good-bye, senhorita e senhor. [shouting in Portuguese] [chuckles] You know, we're either going to have to bundle or freeze tonight. They say that bundling is a New England custom both reverenced and honored. [laughs] Yes. Thank you. Good-bye. The tourist company is sending a car. - Good. - The boat waited last night for two hours. - Did it? - Yes. - Did you wire Deb and Mac? - Yes, I did. You can rejoin your cruise in Buenos Aires. There's a plane going down there first thing in the morning. There's another plane going down in five days. You'll get there the same day as your ship. Oh. Do you know anybody in Buenos Aires? No. Seems a shame to rush down there to spend five days alone. - But you'll be busy. - My business can wait. And we did start off on a tour. We started off for somewhere. If I promise to sit at a different table in the dining room and say, "Good morning, Miss Vale. I hope you slept well." So people will hear me and never guess that I'm head over heels in love with you. Don't say no, Camille. Say, "I'll see." I'll see. May I have this dance? I'm afraid I don't know how to dance. Try it. Just this once. - How did you get here? - Along the balcony. My room is down there. The whole hotel has gone to bed. - So must I. It's disgracefully late. - Not by your Boston clocks. It's only a little before dinner in Boston. Please, don't yet. - Well, I'm not going to struggle with you. - That's right. No telling what sort of primitive instincts you might arouse. Isn't it beautiful? Do you believe in immortality? I don't know. Do you? I want to believe that there's a chance for such happiness to be... carried on somehow, somewhere. - Are you so happy then? - Close to it. Getting warmer and warmer, as we used to say as kids. Remember? "Look out or you'll get burned," we used to say. Are you afraid of getting burned if you get too close to happiness? Mercy, no. I'm immune to happiness and therefore to burns. You weren't immune that night on the mountain. Do you call that happiness? Only a small part. There are other kinds. Such as? Having fun together. Getting a kick out of simple little things. Out of beauty like this. Sharing confidences you wouldn't share with anybody else in all the world. Charlotte, won't you be honest and tell me that you are happy too? Since that night on the boat when you told me about your illness, I... I can't get you out of my mind. Nor out of my heart either. If I were free... there would be only one thing I'd want to do. Prove you're not immune to happiness. Would you want me to prove it? Tell me you would. Then I'll go. My darling, you are crying. I'm such a fool. Such an old fool. These are only tears of gratitude. An old maid's gratitude for the crumbs offered. Don't talk like that. You see, no one ever called me darling before. Let me go. I was lucky. I got them from a vendor outside. They're beautiful. Thank you. I hate good-byes. They don't matter. It's what's gone before. No, it's what can't go after. We may see each other sometime. No, we promised. We are both to go home. Will it help you to know I'll miss you every moment? So will I, Jerry. So will I. [man speaks in Portuguese on PA] Good-bye. Darling. Jerry. [man speaks in Portuguese on PA] [chattering] What am I here for? That's what I want to know. Be nice to Charlotte. It won't hurt you for once. - To be nice to Aunt Charlotte. - Yes. It's Charlotte! - Well, here I am. - Charlotte! - Lisa. - I didn't see you, Charlotte. - Hello, June. - Hello. This is Mr. Hunneker. Two more Vales for you, Ham. Mrs. and Miss. - How do? - How do you do? Darling, I'm so glad you're back. Tell me all the news. - Did you have a good trip? - I got your cable. - Is Mother worse? - No, no. Hamilton Hunneker, the polo player? Is that a question or an accusation? Here, you two. I've got to bustle along. Don't forget Glen Cove and the boat races. - Don't you forget. - [woman] Bye, Miss Vale. Say your prayers, Camille. Be sure I'm at the ceremony. - What ceremony? - Ham, there go the Ricketts. - Wave good-bye. - Good-bye! - Mother, pinch me. - I'm too busy pinching myself. Ham, dear, you better go now. - I'll see you again soon? - I hope so. - Is there anything else I can do? - No, thank you, Ham, very much. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. We'd better get you to customs. Come on. We thought we'd lost you. What a jam. We've been looking everywhere for you. We wanted to say good-bye. Don't anybody say good-bye. Just au revoir. It is a sad time, isn't it, but I want to tell you one thing. There was no lady on this cruise as popular as you were. - Thank you. - Au revoir. Darling, we've got to run. Don't forget your promise. Write soon. - I promise I will, dear. - Be sure now. Make a point of it. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. Say, what is this? Hellos, good-byes, look me ups, be sures... Lisa, I wonder where my luggage is. There are the Vs. Let's go have a look. - You could knock me over with a feather. - Not with your weight, roly-poly. Roly-poly, huh? And where did you get your new figure? - I met a very clever doctor in Rio. - Keep quiet, June. - Hello, Daddy! - Hello, Johnny, my boy. How are you? Charlotte, what's the program for today? First, Dr. Jaquith. I cabled him to save me half an hour. Going to tell him about your new boyfriend? Which one? Cigarette, Aunt Charlotte? Thank you. They're cork-tip. Make sure you get the right end. Thanks for the instructions, roly-poly. If I were you, June, I'd give up. And after Dr. Jaquith? Back to Boston. I'm flying at 3:00. - Back home. - I'll come with you. Hello, Jerry. I'm so glad you were able to meet me. [Lisa] June's staying in New York for a few days. [scoffs] Not on your life, I'm not. I wouldn't miss this show for the world. I'm going to stand on the street corner and sell tickets. Wish me luck, Lisa. - Sure you don't want me to come in? - No, thank you. Oliver, take Mrs. Vale home, and bring the bags up when you get back. - See you tonight. - Good luck. Good-bye. Hello, William. Yes, William, it's me. - Welcome home, Miss Charlotte. - Thank you. Your mother's waiting upstairs in her room. Yes. - I expect you're Miss Charlotte. - Yes, I am. I heard the car and tried to get down before you rang. Pickford's my name. Dora, not Mary. I'm the nurse. We'd better not stand here gabbing. She's got ears like a cat, and she heard that bell as sure as preaching. - What's happened to Mother? - She's fit as a fiddle. She has a heart. She denies it, but she has one. But at her age, who wouldn't have? It's nothing serious. Ought to last her for years if she doesn't get excited. How long has a nurse been necessary? Well, I wouldn't say a nurse has ever been necessary. Mostly she's used us to fetch and carry. There were three or four others before me, just in-and-outers. I lasted a whole month. She gave me the sack today, but that's because you're home. Now, you'd better hurry right in. She'll be waiting. When she waits, she gets mad, and when she gets mad, that means rush the smelling salts. I left her sitting in there all dressed for tonight's party, except for her gown, just as cute as a little red wagon. If you need any help, I'll be on the floor above, packing my duds. I'll see you later. [Jaquith] Just remember that honoring one's parents is still a pretty good idea. You're gonna be a shock to her. I advise you to soften the blow. Give her time to get used to you. Remember that whatever she may have done, she's your mother. Well, Mother. Hello. Mother, you're looking wonderfully well. - Lisa told me you'd been ill, but â€” - Lisa knows nothing about me. Step over there where I can see you. Turn around. Walk up and down. It's worse than Lisa led me to suppose. Much worse. If you'd like me to go... Don't go. I have things to say to you. Sit down. I've asked a number of the family to dinner tonight at 7:30. Lisa told me you had. It's very nice of you, Mother. There'll be Lloyd and Rosa, Hilary and Justine, Lisa and June, Mr. Livingston, Uncle Herbert. - Do you mean Elliot Livingston? - Yes. I shall be wearing my white lace gown tonight. I'd like you to wear your black-and-white foulard. But I've lost over 25 pounds. It won't fit. Oh, yes, it will. I've had Miss Till here for the last week. Hilda is just Lisa's size. We've had all your dresses fitted to her. I've asked Miss Till to stay late tonight, in case there may be any minor alterations necessary. You've thought of everything, haven't you, Mother? Wait a minute. There's something else I want to say to you. Now that you're cured of whatever ailed you, and have come home to take up your duties as a daughter again, I've dismissed the last nurse. I've become used to having a room occupied on the same floor with me, and in view of my heart, I agree it is a wise precaution. You will occupy your father's room from now on. I had William move down all your things yesterday. Your furniture, books, and everything. But Mother... you had no right to move my things. No right in my own house to move what I see fit? I'm not surprised you blush. I was in the room when William took the books from the shelves, and let me say that what we found hidden there was a very great shock to me. I can only hope that a shameful episode in your life is completely past. If you'll excuse me, Mother. I think if you wear your glasses tonight, you'll be less of a shock to the others. And take off whatever you've got on your face. As to your hair and eyebrows, you can say that often after a severe illness, one loses one's hair, but you're letting yours grow as quickly as possible. [Charlotte sighs] [chuckles] Yes, Hilda. It's me. Welcome home, Miss Charlotte. This just came by air express from New York. Thank you. Miss Till is here about the dress. Do you want her in? - In a little while. - Yes, miss. I'll get another blanket and bring your clothes up as soon as I get a chance. No, thank you, Hilda. You needn't bother. Yes, miss. What are you doing in this room? I'm going to sleep here. - You may go. - Yes, ma'am. Didn't you understand I wished someone to sleep on the same floor with me? We can get one of the maids or perhaps we can get the nurse back. "We"? So long as I pay the bills, I'm running this house. Please remember you're a guest, Charlotte. Well, if I am one, then please treat me like one, Mother. Your guest prefers to sleep in this room, if you don't mind. This is no time for humor. As it so happens, I do mind. Where did these flowers come from? From New York. Who sent them? I've forgotten the name of the florist. I think it's on the box. I've seen it. I had the box brought to me first. You know perfectly well what I mean. What person sent the flowers? There wasn't any card. In other words, you don't intend to tell me. Mother, I don't want to be disagreeable or unkind. I've come home to live with you again, here in the same house. But it can't be in the same way. I've been living my own life, making my own decisions for a long while now. It's impossible to go back to being treated like a child again. I don't think I'll do anything of importance that will displease you, but, Mother, from now on you must give me complete freedom, including deciding what I wear, where I sleep, what I read... Where did you get that dress? Lisa and I bought it in New York today. It's outrageous. Where's the black-and-white foulard? I gave it to Miss Till. She was so grateful. Mother, please be fair and meet me halfway. They told me before you were born that my recompense for having a late child was the comfort the child would be to me in my old age, especially if she was a girl. And on your first day home after six months' absence, you behave like this. Mother, wait for me. I'll go down with you. Thank you. I prefer to go down alone. Hilda! Hilda, come here! Mother! She fell all the way down the stairs. Don't worry. Go and get a doctor. There's one down the street. Dr. Regan. Is she conscious? Well, if she isn't, this is the darnedest torn ligament I've ever seen. It'll swell and discolor. She mustn't walk on it. I feel responsible. We quarreled. Charlotte, I believe there are dinner guests waiting downstairs. Or have you discarded your manners also? You may tell my family they may come up to see me, one or two at a time. I think your mother's enjoying the excitement she's going to cause. Must you whisper? Am I to have no attention at all? [mutters] - [groans] - [shushes] [chattering] Hello, everybody. [chattering stops] You look simply gorgeous. - I just love your dress. - Thank you, June. - Hello, Aunt Hester, how are you? - Well. - Mmm. Well. - By Jove. Uncle. - Rosa, I'm glad to see you. - Charlotte. How you've changed. - But you haven't, Lloyd, I'm happy to say. - Eh? - Justine. - I couldn't be more astonished. Yes, it was a shock, wasn't it? But the doctor said it was only a torn ligament. - You did mean Mother, didn't you? - Why, naturally she meant Mother. Brother, dear. Thank you, William. How'd it go? [whispering] I don't know, but I think I won the first round. Good. Oh, by the way, do you know Elliot Livingston? - How do you do? - How do you do? Tell me, why haven't we met before? Well, the world is a small place, but Boston is a big one. - You're right, it is. - [Charlotte] Let's have a fire. - [Justine] You don't mean an open fire? - [Hilary] No, Mother won't like it. Oh, that reminds me, she asked to have you come up by ones and twos. Uncle Herbert, you go first. You're the oldest. For as long as I can remember, that fire has never been lit. High time it was then, Lloyd. Thank you, would you mind? I had no idea you played bridge. Are you doing anything Wednesday for lunch and afterward? I'm short a player. If you think Mother would spare you... I'd love to, Justine, if you think I'd fit in. I think you'd fit in anywhere. And furthermore... Please, no more, Justine, or I shall cry. - Good night. - Good night. I'm proud. Dr. Jaquith would be too. - Good night. - Good night, dear. Can you ever forgive me? Never. I still can't get over our not having met. Well, as a matter of fact, we have. Once and almost twice. I'm mystified. Well, when we were children, you were the only boy who danced with me in dancing school. And the almost is when you were supposed to usher at my coming-out party and didn't show up. I'm covered with shame. I shouldn't have told you. It wasn't nice. Well, I hope you're going to allow me to make up for my past rudeness. - May I telephone you sometime? - Of course. Anytime. - Good night. - Good night. - She wants to see you at once. - Yes, I know. - Good night, Uncle, Aunt Hester. - Thank you for a most unusual evening. Good night. - She wants to see you. - I know. At once. She's had two hours' sleep, and she's bright as a button. And mad. She smelled the fire and sent Hilda to investigate. If I were you, I'd let her blow off her steam. I put two tablespoons of sherry and a sleeping powder in her hot milk, so it shouldn't last long. I'll wait right outside the door. Dora, I suspect you're a treasure. How's your ankle, Mother? Extremely painful. I'm so sorry. I've been doing some thinking as I've been lying here in pain, listening to you all having a good time downstairs. - How much did that dress cost? - It was frightfully expensive. - I'll tell you about it in the morning. - To whom did you charge it? To whom I've always charged my clothes, Mother. And you expect me to pay for articles charged to me of which I do not approve? Well, I could pay for it myself. I've saved quite a little money. I have about $5000. $5000 won't last very long. Especially if your monthly allowance were to be discontinued. Oh. Mother, I want to ask you something. When Father set up the trust for the two boys, why didn't he make one for me too? Because you were a mere child. And he wisely left your affairs to my own better judgment. I'm sure you've always had everything in the world you want. - I haven't had independence. - That's it. That's what I want to talk about. Independence. To buy what you choose, wear what you choose, sleep where you choose. Independence. That's what you mean by it, isn't it? Dr. Jaquith says that independence is reliance upon one's own will and judgment. I make the decisions here, Charlotte. I'm willing you should occupy your old room until I dismiss the nurse. She will occupy your father's room for the time being and will perform a daughter's duties as well as a nurse's. That will give you a good chance to think over what I've said. I'm very glad to give a devoted daughter a home under my roof and pay all her expenses, but not if she scorns my authority. Well, I could earn my own living, Mother. I've often thought about it. I'd make a good head waitress in a restaurant or... You may think that very funny. But I guess you'll be laughing out of the other side of your face if I did carry out my suggestion. I don't think I would. I'm not afraid, Mother. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid, Mother. Charlotte, sit down. I want you to know something I've never told you before. It's about my will. You'll be the most powerful and wealthy member of the Vale family, if I don't change my mind. [slurs words] I advise you to think it over. Where's Dora? I want Dora. I want the back of my head rubbed, my ankle re-bandaged, my pillows fixed, and another cup of that hot toddy. - Which first, Queen Elizabeth? - Head rubbed. Mmm. That's good. Don't stop. You're a good girl, Dora. A good, devoted girl. You wouldn't stick your nose up at a pot of gold, would you, Dora? You're talking absolute nonsense. Nobody's listening. Charlotte's gone to bed. Mmm. - You're groggy, Granny dear. - Mmm. [Charlotte] Dear Dr. Jaquith, Summer, winter, now spring again. I won't say time flies, but it doesn't crawl as it used to. Between Mother and me, there is still an armed truce. She threatens, but she doesn't act. I follow your advice: I stick by my guns but don't fire. There's a man here who's been nice to me. In fact, he's proposed to me, and there are no arguments I can think of why I shouldn't marry him. Most every woman wants a man of her own, a home of her own, and a child of her own. His name is Elliot Livingston. He's from a fine Boston family and is a fine man too. A widower with two half-grown sons. I don't know why I tell you this except I tell you almost everything. Of course, I can't force you to tell me who they're from. They're from Elliot. Why haven't you accepted him? Do you imagine there's a Livingston waiting for you on every corner? I've been waiting to see how you feel about it, Mother. You know as well as I do that it makes no difference to you how I feel about it. You always do exactly as you please. [chuckles] I think you're pleased. I'm nothing of the kind. I'm only so astonished that you of all the family should bring such a feather to the family cap. Then if you really do approve, Mother, dear, why... Keep all that soft talk for Elliot. - [knocks] - Mother, there's no one like you. Come in! - Your flowers just came, miss. - Thank you. - And Mr. Livingston's waiting for you. - Oh, is he? - Would you finish arranging the roses? - Yes, miss. Leave them here for Mother. Don't wait up. It's dinner and a concert. I shall wait up. If I want to. - Good evening, Charlotte. - Hello, Elliot. - Wouldn't they let you sit down? - We're a little late. You look lovely. Thank you. And for the roses too. They're beautiful. And yet you wear camellias. Why do you always, Charlotte? Just a personal idiosyncrasy. We're all entitled to them. But you never let me buy them. Why don't you? - Aren't you full of questions? - And aren't you full of mystery? - I? Good night, William. - Good night. Good night. Charlotte, there are so many things about you I don't understand. You put me off, and you don't tell me why. I don't even know if you're thinking favorably or unfavorably. Oh, favorably, Elliot. But Elliot, there are so many things to think about. Taking over another woman's domain, her house, her sons. You can redo the house. I'll build you a new one. Oh. Elaine was such a wonderful person. Do you often think of her? Well, yes. I want to be honest. But you needn't be afraid that Elaine will ever come back in any way. She's just a memory now. I'm sure she's much more substantial than that. You have her sons. [Charlotte] And I have only a dried corsage and empty bottle of perfume. And I can't even say his name. I want to make you understand that I'll be beginning a new life with you and for you. If we have a child, Elliot, I wonder which one of us it will resemble. A child? I've shocked you. But nevertheless, when I marry you, that'll be one of the chief reasons. Well, whatever the reason, if only you'd... I didn't say "if," Elliot, I said "when." - Have another cocktail. - Oh, I don't mind. [man] Hello, Charlotte. - Charlotte, darling. - Gracie. - Elliot, you're bad. - I know we're late. It was my fault. Hello, George. "The last, the best," we always say, Charlotte. Well, come on. Let's find a cocktail. I'm two up on you. Let me see. I think we've got old-fashioneds and martinis. Which for you? Well, it doesn't really... What's the matter? You see a ghost? No, I think I know the man who's talking to Hortense and Barbara. Oh, J.D. Durrance. Yes, he's doing a job for me. Architect for the medical center. Nice chap. Not Boston, you know, but all right. We've been trying to get him to dinner all winter. Shall I tell him your name or let him guess? - Let him guess. - Right. J.D., here's someone who thinks she's met you before. Why, yes, of course. You do look familiar. Don't tell me her name, George. Wait a minute, I've got it. Beauchamp, isn't it? - Camille Beauchamp. - I'm sorry, but this is not the same lady. My name is Vale. I met you on a pleasure cruise once. Oh, yes, Ms. Vale. I hope you'll forgive me. I'm sure... [chuckles] I shall leave you two alone to make your own peace. George tells me you've been in Boston very often this winter, Mr. Durrance. - [whispers] And I didn't know. - Yes, several times. You look simply glorious. An architect? I could cry with pride. Yes, it's an interesting job I'm doing for George. I wanted horribly to call you up. - The medical center, isn't it? - Yes. I walk by your house on Marlborough Street. Once I almost rang the bell. Thank you. Tell me about Deb and Mac. You introduced me to them on the pleasure cruise, remember? They're both fine. How is Tina? Well, Tina... We're having quite a bad time with Tina. Tell me about it. I'm afraid we've got to send her away somewhere. The doctor thinks she shouldn't be with her mother. I took her to see Dr. Jaquith, who was highly recommended to me by this Camille Beauchamp I mistook you for. Camille, I am still horribly in love. Come along, everybody. We simply have to dine now, or we'll never get to the concert. [orchestra playing] Camille... I must see you. May I come to your house tonight? I won't stay but ten minutes. I must talk to you. Yes, do. [playing continues] [phone ringing] Hello? Yes. What's the name, please? - Is that for me, Hilda? - Yes, miss. Thank you. Hello? [Jerry] Charlotte? - Jerry, why didn't you â€” - I'm leaving tonight on the midnight. - But why? - I've got to get back on business. Mrs. Weston told me the news. You're engaged to marry her brother. I wanted to tell you. I just wanted to say that I thought he was a grand person, and I hope you'll be very happy. Where are you now? I've got to see you. No, Charlotte, I think it best that we don't. Good-bye. Hilda. Hilda. Call a taxi quickly, will you? Jerry. Charlotte, you shouldn't have come. I had to see you. I wanted to talk to you about Elliot. Why are you marrying him? Do you love him? Not like we do. Not like us. I thought it might grow to be or something like it. I thought I was getting over you, Jerry. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. We'd made our pact, and we were living up to it. How about Livingston? What sort of man is he? Like you in many ways. Not your sense of humor, nor your sense of beauty, nor your sense of play. But a fine man, and a kind of refuge I thought I could never have. - You're not angry with me? - No. Only with myself. I was a cad to make you care for me and then because of some noble sense of duty, to leave you to get over it the best you can. And there isn't a thing I can do about it. Isobel depends on me more and more. She's ill and getting worse. And there's Tina. - Even if I could chuck everything â€” - But I wouldn't let you, Jerry. Jerry, what's the feminine for your word? That's what I am. I knew you were married, and I walked right in with my eyes wide open. - But you said it would make you happier. - And it has. I've got back my work, and it's due to you. I've been hoping you'd say that. I have more understanding for Tina. I'm even kinder to Isobel. - So don't blame yourself. - Then don't you. - It's different. - It's not. Shall I tell you what you've given me? On that very first day, a little bottle of perfume made me feel important. You were my first friend. And then when you fell in love with me, I was so proud. And when I came home, I needed something to make me feel proud. And your camellias arrived, and I knew you were thinking about me. I could've walked into a den of lions. As a matter of fact, I did, and the lions didn't hurt me. Please take back what you said. If you can marry that man and have a full and happy life, I will. - I'll try. - [conductor] All aboard! I'll look for you around every corner. Good-bye, darling. Good-bye, darling. [conductor] All aboard! Do you know where we'll be two weeks from today? We'll be on the ocean, two days off San Francisco. That's so soon, Elliot. I do want to be sure. - You know what I'd like? - Mm-hmm? I'd like you to take me to some Bohemian restaurant for dinner some night, where we could be very gay, have cocktails and champagne, and you could make love to me, and... [chuckles] Well, what I mean is... if I could... if I could just get rid of some of my inhibitions, just for once, I might have more confidence. Time will give you confidence. That's not what I mean. Well, what do you mean? I read... a novel once about a woman, a very repressed woman. She was in an automobile accident with a man. It was a very cold night. He gave her a drink to keep her warm. And because of the drink, she lost her inhibitions. You see, she was just... I'm afraid I sound very depraved. - Ell â€” - Char... I wonder if we were both going to say the same thing. About our trip... If you like, I can exchange the two tickets for three and take the boys. - Would you? - Certainly. Charlotte, I've been thinking about us. Yes? Perhaps we wouldn't be happy. We wouldn't be, Elliot. You ought to marry someone who would enjoy what you enjoy. Let's not linger over it, Elliot. Well, I suppose you'll meet somebody, sometime. No, I don't think I'll ever marry. Some women just aren't the marrying kind. But you'll meet someone. Thank you for thinking it was me. I have that on my record, anyway. - Do I kiss you good-bye? - No, let's not. It isn't really good-bye. We'll see each other again, won't we? Of course we will. Well, good-bye till we meet again. Good-bye till we meet again. [Charlotte] It's like the time when my father died. His breathing just stopped. All over, finished. Ended forever. You fool! Oh, you fool! Now youâ€™ll never have a home of your own, or a man of your own, or a child of your own. Hello, Mother. I thought Elliot was staying for lunch. What's his hurry today? Mother, Elliot and I have broken our engagement. What did you say? I said, Elliot and I have broken our engagement. Why have you done that? Because I don't love him. Have you no sense of obligation to your family or to me? Here you have the chance to join our name, Vale, with one of the finest families in the city, Livingston. And you come in here and tell me that you're not in love? You're behaving like a romantic girl of 18. I don't doubt it. And what do you intend to do with your life? Get a cat and a parrot and live alone in single blessedness. Stop rocking. You've never done anything to make your mother proud or to make yourself proud either. Why, I should think you'd be ashamed to be born and live all your life as Charlotte Vale. Miss Charlotte Vale. Dr. Jaquith says that tyranny is sometimes the expression of the maternal instinct. If that's a mother's love, I want no part of it. I didn't want to be born. You didn't want me to be born either. It's been a calamity on both sides. [exhales] Oh, Mother, let's not quarrel. We've been getting along together so well lately. It was a horrid... thing to say. Dora! Dora! We quarreled. I did it. I did it. I did it. [whispers] I did it. "To these household servants who were still serving me at the time of my death, I bequeath to each of the above-mentioned the sum of $3000. All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, real, personal, or mixed, I give, devise, and bequeath to my beloved daughter Charlotte Vale." [Charlotte] I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I never did anything to make my mother proud. I must see Dr. Jaquith. Oh, Jerry. Jerry, where are you now when I need you so much? [door opens] Hello, Scooter. Hello, Scooter. Do you remember me? Do you? [chuckles] Miss Trask. - Well, look who's here. - Hello. Well, for goodness sake, I hardly know you. Oh, of course. I was about to send the police for you. The doctor wired you were coming. It's been a very long drive. I'm tired. Do you suppose I could go to my room right away? Why, of course you can. I've put you in Room 18. That's your old room, remember? I thought it'd make you feel at home. - Thank you. - How's Jaquith? Same as ever. Handing out common sense instead of sympathy. Now... - Could Samson get my bags? - Of course. Samson? Get Miss Vale's bags out of her car. How's it coming? All right. - What's it supposed to be? - I don't know. Here's the little girl's other slipper. Do you mind if I join you? What's the title of the picture? Oh, "The Proposal." I'll collect all the pink pieces, that is, if you don't mind. Of course, some people prefer to do a puzzle alone. I know who you are. You do? Who am I? You're my new nurse. - No, I'm not. You're quite wrong. - You can't fool me. And I know why you've come here. To make sure I don't run away from this place again. Did you run away from here once? I didn't know. - What's your name? - You know my name. That's why you stood there and stared at me. That was very rude of me. But, you see, you reminded me of somebody. Who? Well, if you must know, myself. Of course, at your age. You're about 14, aren't you? I'm 12... nearly 13. There you are. Christine, your schedule calls for you to spend the evening with the young people next door. - They don't want me. - Oh, nonsense. Of course they want you. But I'll bet they'd want you a lot more if you just make a little effort yourself. I've got a fine ping-pong game all fixed up for you. Barbara and Betty against you and Bob. - He's the best player here. - Of course he is. That's why you're going to be his partner. To make the match more even. But I'll be the worst one. I'll die. I'll just die. You'll do nothing of the sort. Don't dramatize, Christine. Oh, please, please, please. Don't make me. Don't make me. - Don't make me! [sobs] - Oh, Christine. Don't make her. The doctor wants Christine to have exercise in the evening. And I'm here... I'll see that she has some exercise. I have to take my car down to the town and leave it at the garage to be washed. Christine could go with me. We'll walk back. Or run if you like. That is, if Christine would be kind enough to go with me. Would you? - Yes. - I'm sorry, Christine... Please, let me go with this lady. I promise to drink all my cocoa tonight if you will. For goodness sake, Christine, don't carry on. Go get your coat. I'm sorry, Trask. I couldn't help it. Hmm. I thought you were too tired to do anything but just crawl into bed. I guess Cascades has performed another miracle on me. Tell Christine I'll be right down. I'm going upstairs. By the way, Christine's room is next to yours, so you'll share the same bathroom. Don't be disturbed if you hear her crying. She has spells of it. Just ignore it. It's one of her little tyrannies, like refusing to eat. Just ignore that too. Only if you could manage to get a little food into her tonight, it would help. I'll try. How long have you been at Cascades? Ten days. Nearly 11. - You don't like it much, do you? - No. Neither did I at the end of ten days. The first two weeks are the worst. I shall never like it. - Do you want to go home? - No. - Where do you want to go? - [sighs] I don't know. My mother doesn't want me at home. That's why it's helping Father for me to be here. Where were you headed when you ran away? For a telephone booth in town to put in a reverse call to my daddy. - To ask him to come and get you? - No. I promised him I'd stay here for two weeks. I just wanted to hear Daddy's voice again. I'm almost sure my father's dying. [sobbing] Is he sick? They won't let me speak to him, so I don't know. Listen, Christine. There's the telephone booth. And here's my change purse. Do you think your father will be home tonight? - You mean I can call him now? - That's exactly what I mean. Go ahead. Help me, will you, please? I'm not sure I can run it. Of course. [chimes] - [operator] Number, please. - Long distance, please. [operator] Long distance. I want to put in a person-to-person call to... Jeremiah Duveaux Durrance. Mount Vernon 2940. ...to Mr. Jeremiah Duveaux Durrance. Mount Vernon 2940. - [operator] 2940? - Yes, thank you. [operator] Deposit 50 cents, please. [chimes] All of that? Hello? Yes? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, Daddy. Tina. - Anything wrong? - Oh, hello, Daddy. Are you all right? Oh, Daddy, I just wanted to hear you speak to me. When are you coming up to see me? I'm so lonesome here. Why can't you come tomorrow? But, Daddy, you promised. Yes, I remember. Good-bye. Thank you for letting me call him. Thank you, thank you. Oh, I'd like to finish my ice cream now. I think we'd better have some fresh... Would you bring us two more vanillas, please? But I'll owe you so much. Daddy said I'm to pay you back. He wanted to know who was letting me call him, and all I could say was a nice light lady, and that I'd write to him tomorrow and tell him your name. What is your name, please? Don't you think secrets are fun? Just refer to me as the nice light lady. It sounds so mysterious. Look here, I wouldn't tell Miss Trask about the phone call. It might get me in wrong. Oh, no. Nor Dr. Brine nor Dr. Jaquith. I won't tell a single living soul. I'd soon as sicken and die than put you in the wrong. Tina, really? You called me Tina. Did I? How stupid of me. But then it is a nickname for Christine, isn't it? Yes, but nobody calls me that now except my daddy. Well, I won't then. No, please. I want you to call me Tina. [Tina crying] [crying continues] It's I, Tina. Don't be afraid. What's the matter? [sobs] Oh, Tina. Tina. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. I won't till you're asleep. Tell me, what's the matter? I'm ugly and mean, and nobody likes me. Tina, you? I'm not pretty in the least. You know I'm not. Well, whoever wants that kind of prettiness, Tina? There's something else you can have if you earn it, a kind of beauty. What kind? Something that has nothing to do with your face. A light that shines from inside you because you're a nice person. You think about it. Someday you'll know I'm right. Will they like me then? Who are they? Everybody. All the kids at school, Miss Trask, and the nurses and the doctors. There must be something awfully wrong with me. Do you like them, Tina? The kids at school, and Miss Trask, and the nurses and the doctors? No, I hate them. [shushes] That's something else you've got to grow up with. If you want people to like you, you've got to like people. That's why Miss Trask asked you to cooperate, and that's what Dr. Jaquith means when he tells you to play the game. I bet you're only fooling me. You try it and see. In the meantime, if it'll help you any, I like you. I think you're very pretty, very sweet. All right? All right. Why are you so good to me? Because somebody was good to me once when I needed somebody. Now, go to sleep. Close your eyes and let your muscles go all limp. That's better. I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who was afraid. A little girl, Tina, who was afraid because she thought she was alone. [Charlotte] This is Jerry's child in my arms. This is Jerry's child clinging to me. Impertinent. Upsetting rules. Thinks she can run the works. Oh, I'm terrible. [laughs] Of course you are. So am I. What's the difference? We'll learn. I want to talk to you. - Who, me? - Yes, you. I thought you might. Here you go, Tina. - I hear you're running Cascade now. - Dr. Jaquith... You give orders to my doctors, you give orders to Miss Trask. I didn't give orders. I requested. I thought you came up here to have a nervous breakdown. Well, I've decided not to have one, if it's all the same to you. Well, then, since you're no longer my patient, since you've become a member of my staff, Doctor... - I know I've been impertinent. - Go ahead. Maybe I like it. It's just that the child is so unhappy here. I don't think she's being treated wisely. I used to be proud of you. This time I'm ashamed. And isn't it wonderful that you know so much better? I have a proposition to make to you. I haven't anything to do with my time. Mightn't I be the nurse instead? I promise not to do anything again without asking your permission first. If... I've already canceled the nurse. Just go ahead. Tell me what you'd do. Stay with her. Pay attention to her. Make her feel wanted and important. And just as soon as you said we could, I'd take her camping in the woods. She adores camping. Sounds like a wonderful break for her. Of course, I couldn't do it without her parents' permission. I wouldn't. What would her mother say, do you suppose? Oh, she'd accept any plan that would relieve her of the child who's always been a thorn in her flesh, though the lady would strongly protest if she heard me say so. And her father, what will his attitude be? Sympathetic and protective, possibly too protective for Christine's good. Result? Resentment felt by the mother. The child's absence from the home became desirable for all concerned, so I brought her here. I was highly recommended to the father by a friend of his, but, of course, he placed the child in my care, not in yours. I suppose I'd better ask you something. How much do you know about South America? - Well, geographicallyâ€” - No, that's not what I mean. About my automobile accident and the man who was with me. You told me in New York that he led me from one difficulty into another. A patient of mine who has a phobia about high places told me about an accident happening to a man and woman in Brazil when she was there. She knew the woman's name, but not the man's. In fact, she told me the woman's name before I could stop her. - And who told you the man's? - Nobody. I don't know his name. Then you didn't know that Christine's father and I had met before. No, I didn't know. If I had known, I wouldn't have suggested your coming to Cascade at present. I had no idea you'd ever met Durrance. Then that alters the whole situation. But you just admitted... I don't know anything about your relationship with Durrance. I don't know how emotionally involved you are with him. I can't work in the dark when there's a child in the picture. I'll tell you everything. It's over. That's it in two words. And Tina needs me just as much now as she did a minute ago. And I've never been needed before. Well, I'm crazy, but if you promise to behave yourself... - I'll tell her. - You're only on probation. Remember what it says in the Bible, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away." How does it feel to be the Lord? Not so very wonderful since the free will bill was passed. Too little power. [laughs] And I'm not going to have a nurse. I'm just going to have her. She'll be my... What are you? - Your friend. - Yes. She's going to be my friend. I can tell you her name now. She said I could. It's Miss Vale. No, not the kind you wear on your face, but V-A-L-E. And she's from Boston. And she's ever so nice. What's that, Daddy? He said to tell you thank you. Would you like to talk to him? No, thank you. She won't talk to you. I think she's quite shy. You know something, Daddy? Pretty soon, when the doctor says it's all right, she's going to take me away, camping. Just her and me. I think I've got a trout! I think I have one too. [both laughing] Miss Vale! - What's cooking? - Potatoes. And they're cooked. Mmm. They smell good. - What have you been doing? - Writing a letter. - Is it a secret? - Do we have secrets, Tina? As a matter of fact, I was writing a letter to Dr. Jaquith to see if I could keep you with me for a while longer. When I go back to Boston in the fall, I'd like to take you home with me. Would you like that? Why, I'd love it! It'll be just like playing house. - Here. - Thank you. Ooh. Ooh, Tina. Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you old enough to be my mother? Good heavens, of course I am. - I wish you were my mother. - No, you don't, Tina. You mustn't even think that. But you're not like most mothers. You don't tell me what to do and what not to do all the time. I wish I didn't have to call you Miss Vale. It sounds as if we didn't know each other very well. Would you like to call me some nickname? A sort of special name of our own? As if we were kind of chums? I'd love it! What sort of a name? Well, there are all sorts of abbreviations for Charlotte. You could call me Carlotta or Charlie or Auntie or Tantie, or a name I was called once in fun, Camille, or even Aunt Charlotte. I guess I'll call you Camille. It's kind of a funny name though. - Ever been in this house before? - You know I haven't. It's a gloomy old pile. How anyone can bear to live in it is more than I know. Tina writes me she lives here like a princess in a palace. Yes? Well, I suppose it feeds her starved sense of self-importance. [chattering] - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - Good evening. I thought you said gloom. I'm amazed. Here, hold this for me, will you? Hello, there. Welcome, Dr. Jaquith. Remember me? Who could forget you? This is Mr. Durrance, Tina's father. - How do you do? - How do you do? Hey, what goes on here? - We're roasting weenies. - Roasting weenies? Uh-huh. They make swell canapÃ©s. Come on, I'll introduce you to my gang, and you can roast too. [Tina] Daddy! Daddy! Tina! Walk down slowly, darling, or you'll trip on your dress. Daddy! Oh, Daddy! Can this be Tina? Do I look nice? It's my first party dress. You look lovely. Do you really like me? I love you. Tina, don't you think it would be nice to show your father your room and your studio and everything? - Would you like to see my room, Daddy? - Very much, if Miss Vale will pardon us. How long are you going to call her Miss Vale? What should I call her? I don't know. Would it sound too funny if Daddy should call you my name for you, Camille? I think it would sound very nice indeed. Don't keep him too long, will you, Tina? June has some very special canapÃ©s for you. - Thank you, Lisa. - Wonderful. What will you call this wing? I ought to name it after you since it's your interest and time and money that made it possible. I'm putting you on the board of directors. You knew I would, didn't you? How nice of you. I thought that this partition was going to be over here. What are you looking at, Dr. Owl? I'm just wondering. Are you the same woman who, a few months ago, hadn't a single interest in the world? No. Well, I showed him everything. And now he's gone into the library. Oh. Take care of Dr. Jaquith. That's a funny thing to tell me. How do you take care of a doctor? - A doctor's supposed to take care of you. - Have a chip. Thank you, Dr. Jaquith. What are you doing in here all alone? - I've decided to take Tina home. - Take her home? But... But you can't. What do you mean? Dr. Jaquith says it would be the worst possible thing for Tina to go home now. Surely he's told you that we have to wait until she's physically fit before we can treat her like a normal girl again. I don't care what he says. No self-respecting man would allow such self-sacrifice as yours to go on indefinitely. Why, Jerry, that's the most conventional, pretentious, pious speech I ever heard in my life. I simply don't know you. I can't go on forever taking, taking, taking from you and giving nothing, darling. Oh, I see. Forgive me, Jerry. It's your pride, isn't it? Let me explain. You will be giving. But don't you know that to take is sometimes a way to give? The most beautiful way in the world if two people love each other. You'll be giving me Tina. Every single day, I'll be taking and you'll be giving. It's kind of you to put it that way. Then is it something that Tina has said? Don't you think she's happy here? Happy? She confessed to me upstairs she thought she loved you almost as much as she loves me. Well, what is the reason? Is it something about us? Of course it's about us. What else could it be? I wish you'd tell me what it is. Why didn't you marry Livingston? I'll tell you why. Because I came along and ruined him for you. And now my child comes along and claims all your attention and takes your whole life when you should be trying to find some man who'll make you happy. Some man who'll make me happy? So that's it. So that's it. Well, I've certainly made a great mistake. Here I have been laboring under the delusion that you and I were so in sympathy, so one, that you'd know without being asked what would make me happy. And you come up here to talk about some man. Apparently, you haven't the slightest conception of what torture it is to love a man and to be shut out, barred out, to be always an outsider and an extra. Charlotte, let me... Why, when Tina said she wanted to come home and stay with me, well, it was like a miracle happening, like having your child, a part of you. And I even allowed myself to indulge in the fantasy that both of us loving her, and doing what was best for her together would make her seem actually like our child after a while. But I see no such fantasy has occurred to you. Again, I've been just a big sentimental fool. It's a tendency I have. Wait a minute. I was afraid you were keeping Tina out of pity, but there was no note of pity in your ridicule of me just now. Now I know you still love me, and it won't die, what's between us. Do what you will â€” ignore it, neglect it, starve it, it's stronger than both of us together. Please let me go. Oh, Charlotte. Please let me go. Jerry, Dr. Jaquith knows about us. When he said I could take Tina, he said, "You're on probation." Do you know what that means? It means that I'm on probation because of you and me. He allowed this visit as a test... and if I can't stand such tests, I'll lose Tina... and we'll lose each other. Jerry, please help me. Shall we just have a cigarette on it? Yes. May I sometimes come here? Whenever you like. It's your home too. There are people here who love you. I'll look at you and Tina and share with you peace and contentment? Of course. And just think it won't be for this time only. That is, if you'll help me keep what we have. If we both try hard to protect that little strip of territory that's ours... we can talk about your child... Our child. Thank you. And will you be happy, Charlotte? Oh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars.
