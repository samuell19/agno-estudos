Good morning, Kan! Good morning, ma'am! Thank you. Nice of you to come and get me. If I may say so, ma'am, it's a pleasure. How did you know I was coming? I simply guessed. Ah! You simply guessed it... by checking every passing car? Don't you like me anymore? Would it make any difference? Where are you going? That's not the way to the house. It's the way to my house, where I live with three young men. Never mention them again. I've had enough of those troublemakers. Troublemakers whom the boss fired because they were peeping, watching you undress. But you were deliberately provoking them just like you're provoking me! Stop! I want you to stop! I'm not taking orders anymore. At this very moment, I quit! Stop the car! No! Leave me alone! No! Please! Leave me alone! No! Let me go, you bastards! No! Please! No! No! No! No, let me go! Let me go! Let me-- Oh, yes! Yes, yes, that's it. Yes, that's good. Cécilia! What happened to you, my love? I was very worried. I'll kill them for this! André. There's something I've got to tell you! It's monstrous! My wife violated by two filthy pigs! I didn't tell you all this just so you'd go and turn the thing into a tragedy. I don't want you to think in terms of killing, of punishment or revenge. We've been married now for over two years. You know I fell in love with you from the moment I saw you in Paris. I left the man I loved. And I divorced. My dear friend, I'd like to introduce you to my niece, Cécilia. She'll take good care of you. She adores hot nights and and playboys. Nice ambiance here. Yes, and I hope to have a great night! Ah, Cécilia. May I present André, the son of the departed Compte de la Meute. Your father's dead, isn't he? Yes. Ah, hello, my friend. How are you? Just great. Nice party. Thanks for inviting me. Cécilia, dance with André. She so shy, you know. Yes... Oh! You didn't see Hamlet? With those dwarves? Simply divine. You mean you saw dwarves? Oh, it was beyond words. "On s'en fout, nous on s'aime." And we're in love, too. Come on! Look at that, over there. Isn't it beautiful? And right over there is the River Seine. You want to see the cathedral? Look, it's right there. And then we got married. And you brought me here, into your world, your land, your life at the embassy. Weren't you happy? I was happy, very much. I was yours, body and soul, for two years, yours alone. I'd never been faithful to anybody before you. The first few months were marvelous, deliciously exhausting! We made love for nights on end. Then gradually... it's true, our passion died down. I still love you. So do I. Our love will last forever. I could never love another man. Nor I another woman. When we made love today, when I came back, it felt like it used to, in the beginning when we first met. I came so hard, I thought I'd faint! And, do you know why? I'm very conscious of it. It's because those two boys made me come so hard, that I went mad. They managed to bring out in me an extraordinary sensuality. The animal in heat! Then, when I returned to you, I felt absolute happiness! I desired you like the first time. Didn't you notice? And, in one single hour, I gave you... more love than in the past two years! And I felt no shame about my body, which others had just possessed. Because genuine love has nothing to do with violent, carnal desire. Don't you think so, André? What are you getting at? I want you to understand something which is very important. Wouldn't it be far, far better, my love, if we left our senses a certain freedom? If we renounced physical fidelity? It wouldn't necessarily mean that we would grow colder toward each other or that we would become indifferent to each other. Do you mean that you've had enough of me? Of course not! Tell me, over the past two years, didn't you ever desire another woman? Yes, I did. But I've only been with you. And you know that. Yes, I do. But you were emotionally unfaithful to me. Admit it, at least. Why not just be sincere? Why not always try to live with the truth? Listen to me--I understand now that I could love somebody with all my might, but enjoy sex with another. And that coming back to the one you want and love brings the greatest happiness. Who could have thought of that? I never hoped for such a thing. Ah, I won the race! I wouldn't mind a kiss from my loving husband. I'm sure you'll have no trouble finding a man who'll kiss you far better than me. And if I'm right, a kiss from me would probably bore you. Looks like we're in for stormy weather. I can't stand it anymore, Antonin! Alright, tell grandmother all about it. Come on, don't make fun of me. It's him I'm making fun of! No man loved by a woman like you has a right to get angry at her. I mean it. Help me, Antonin! Let's drink to friendship! Yes, let's drink to friendship! And now, to love! To freedom! All right. Yes, to freedom. To freedom in love. My dear guests... I think... I think I'd better beg your permission to retire now. I think I'm drunk... wine, brandy, cocktails and whatnot... Would you mind... helping your grandmother to her room? You will, huh? Okay. You don't mind, huh? You want to dance? Why not? What do you want from me, exactly? I want to make love with you. ♪ Roll me over in the clover! ♪ ♪ Roll me over! Lay me down! ♪ Okay! You don't have to play the part of the drunk and decadent marquis any longer. How was I, huh? Marvelous! I wasn't acting. I am a drunk and decadent marquis! Do you think we've got a chance? She always does whatever's most fun for her. It seems to me that a lot of women seduce men just to prove to themselves that they're beautiful and utterly irresistible. And, making love is, for many of them, a formality afterwards. And, what about me? You too, Cécilia! Don't tell anybody, because you'd damage my reputation as a man-eater! But you truly are a man-eater! And you'd want... quite a few of them! I turn you on, huh? What excites me is the way you speak. We'd better get back to the dining room, don't you think? We've got to stick to our timing. So soon? That's what I call fast work! - Cécilia! - Yes? Cécilia! I can explain! Wait a minute, Cécilia! You're a macho man, that's what you are. You macho men can do anything you please. It doesn't mean a thing, right? For Christ's sake, let me explain! Leave me alone. Cécilia, wait a second! Listen to me. Let me tell you. Let me explain. Cécilia, open the door! Open the door! Thanks. Thank you for the lesson. I love you and I want you more than ever! André, it's funny, it feels like my life began the day I met you. Thank you, darling. - Do you love me? - Very much. You know, it's kind of weird being in this house, being thrown into the past. Come on, let's go in and join the others. What a nice party. Ah, so there you are. I hope you're liking the party. Yes, we are. Oh, so you're still in love? Lucky you! Come here! Oh, come on, let's join the crowd. We had a magnificent stroll. May I present my niece. She doesn't live in Paris, but-- We've known each other for a long time. Oh, of course. What's the matter with me? You still owe me half a dance, remember? Yes, of course. See you later. What do think? Oh, they're charming. Oh, come on, André. What are you looking so sad for? Oh, he'll bring her back. It's just one dance. Enjoy yourself! Yes, come. Yes, let's go, come on. They say that that your first novel was autobiographical. Yes, one time I sat down and decided to write a story about my first abortion. What's the title? "Neither Virgin Nor Martyr." Bravo! Oh, come on, cheer up! Will you come and dance with me? Oh, of course. Have fun. Let's get away. Don't tell me you're happy with him. I am. Very happy. - Listen to me, Cécilia. - Enough! But I want you, Cécilia. Listen to me. For Christ's sake, will you leave me alone? Come with me, Cécilia. Let's get away. I told you "No." - Come on, let go of me. - But--No! Listen to the birds, darling. Listen! So close to Paris, how beautiful! Oh, there you are. Bravo! Oh, congratulations. You were marvelous. Wha--? You're too modest. I wanted to congratulate you. Thank you... Oh yes, you were sublime. The way you held onto her-- But... Oh yes! And I'll have you know, my friend, we both expected no less from you. What a wonderful display of mastery. Sheer mastery. Such panache! Last week, on television-- We didn't miss a second. Not a second of the horse race. Yes, yes. Oh, yes. The horse race. Right. We're going to love, and want each other more than ever. Yes. You're not only my wife and my mistress-- You're also-- my confidant. My love. Well, now-- Now, we can do anything we want to! Not quite. We can't love anybody else, nor be infatuated. The love we feel for each other must remain... the greatest. Of course, darling. But then, we've got to tell each other about all our adventures. Yes. You know, I read in a book a long time ago about lovers who came to an agreement. They allowed themselves total freedom to make sure that they'd stay faithful. That's what we'll do. Want to know what happened next? She killed him out of jealousy. And you? Would you have done it too? Me? I... I would have done the same thing. And you? I don't know. Maybe the same. Who are your friends? No idea! I just met them. I met them yesterday at the riding club. They're a strange couple. I hope they're fun. Otherwise, we'll throw them overboard. The way she looks at me, she's like a hungry tigress! And he brings out my incestuous desires. If it's that funny, would you mind letting me in on it? Sure, why not. That's what we do for a living. I used to be a pretty good classical dancer, but when George finished school, I whipped up this act here we have together. And can George do this? What do you mean? He's my son. I had him when I was barely fifteen. How old does that make him now? Sixteen. Is it true you've made love with him? Have you really? Yes. I taught him on several occasions. Who could have taught him better than me? And what does society have to say about you? No, that's precisely why we moved here. We've earned quite a bit of money since we started working together. We just bought ourselves a club in town. Will you be putting on your act there? Of course! I hope you'll come to see me. In fact, we may come every evening. It's hard to believe you have a son! You've got marvelous breasts. I'd like mine to be as nice. Don't be an idiot. Your breasts are marvelous, too. Unka! Unka! Unka! - Yes, ma'am? - My husband isn't here yet? No, ma'am. The telephone isn't working. It's out of order. Will you run me a bath? Cécilia? André, where are you? I'm still downtown. Yes, but where? I'm at Madam Olga's place, with three pretty girls from the countryside. They're helping me forget yesterday's inanities. I want you. So do I. I'll tell you all about it when we make love. Will you be long? It depends-- I'm smack in the middle of things. Be patient. You're a pig. I love you! So do I. Will you pour me another glass of that swill? Yes, sir. - You must be Portuguese. - Yes, sir. They're all over the goddamn place. Kan? Kan! Come in. Come in, ma'am. What can we do for you? They're all family-- cousins. Are you coming? Would you mind driving the car back? I can't. I'm glad you came, ma'am. You made us all very happy. How will you get home? I'll walk. I don't mind. Ma'am, I wanted to tell you about my brother, Kan. How should I tell you-- He loves you. He's shipping out to sea. He'll be gone a long while. He wants to see you. He told me. Then why did he reject me? He's a proud man. See you soon. Hello, Kan. Morning, ma'am. If you want to go in for a swim, I'll take care of your horse. Like I used to. You can count on me. I'm at your disposal. Kan, I'm so glad that you're back. Thank you. Stop! Mr. André! Mr. André! Mr. André, the missus' horse has come back alone. Do you know what time she left? She must have left bright and early this morning. I didn't hear her leave, sir. Why did you come back? I couldn't stop thinking about you. My obsession was such that I had to come back and hold you in my arms. I had to tell you I love you. I don't love you. I know. A lady like you could never fall in love with a guy like me. Please, Kan. Please don't try to see me again. Okay, I won't! In any case, my boat leaves tomorrow morning. That's the reason why I followed you today, it was my last chance. Will you be gone a long time? I'd like to never come back. And try to forget all this. Yeah, try to forget. When I'm near you I live through you. I breathe through you, I sleep through you. It's more than I can bear. Cécilia-- You know, I've been all over the world, but the sea is always the same. It made me realize when I looked out onto the waves, those same waves would soon wash over your beautiful, naked body That the wind, which sounded me, would then go on to tussle your hair. Go away! Go away, you hear! Okay, I'm going. But I won't come back. I don't want to see you anymore. Me neither, my love. Let's say goodbye here. My husband must be looking for me. All right. I'll close my eyes so I won't see you go. My ship leaves tomorrow at dawn. I'll have the whistle blown three times, once for each time we made love. Maybe you'll hear it from your room. Cécilia! You frightened me! Well, so did you. When your horse came back alone, I was so afraid something had happened to you. Something did happen. My horse ran away, while I was swimming in the sea. Bravo! Bravo! Look-- I didn't like that whore at all. She bored me. I can do better than her. Show us then. There's nothing to it. I could do it better. That little bitch turns you on, right? Well, I thought she was pretty good. - Why did you call her a bitch? - Because that's what she is. That makes three of us. So am I. And if that excites you, I can do even more! Okay, that's enough. You've had enough to drink. I'm still thirsty. I haven't had enough yet. And I feel fine! I feel amazing! And if you think she put on a show, wait till you see mine. Oh, excuse me! That's enough now! - She's wasted. - Yeah, looks like it. - Come on! - Please, come back here. Oh, good! Whoa! André! Come and dance. Help me... She's great! That's enough! Stop! I got it... Stop, right now! Come on! That's enough! - Come! - No! That's quite enough! Enough! Let me go! No! The party's over, Let's go! Stop! How about that, eh? The dancing girl! What do you know? Hang on! We can't let her get away. She just might at that. Well, let's catch her. What good do you think that will do you, huh? How the hell can she run so fast? Come on, you guys! No! No! Leave me alone! No! No! No! No! So you finally came around! Any idea where he is? No. But I know who he is with. Her name is Ruth, and she's American. She's the daughter of an oil magnate or maybe it's gas. How could he leave this way, knowing the state I'm in? When they found you in the woods, raped, half-dead, he said, "I hope she survives. In any event, she probably got a big kick out of the whole thing." When you came to, and it looked like you'd be all right, he went away with Ruth, whom he'd met a few days before. Where did they go? They left forAsia, but I don't know for how long. He said you'd understand. He said you had made a pact, and that you didn't stick to it. - So, he knows about Kan? - Of course. André is an intelligent man. All he had to do was bring Kan's coat back to his brothers. What can I do? Do you love him? You want him back? Yes. I swear I love him! You know, this thing with Kan was just plain crazy. It was, well, poetry. And poems are usually very short--too short. It's our fault. We make them too short. Wait, Cécilia! Poor woman! With or without freedom, we are... always the victim of men. Yes. And you know why? It's because we're slaves of love, that's why. That's just how it is. We may try our best to please them, but it's useless. Just try to relax. Calm down! And don't think about him anymore. Don't think about him! He doesn't deserve you any more than the others do. Believe me. You're right. I love you, darling. Your skin is so soft. You're beautiful. André is here, in the dining room. He told me everything. He can't live without you. All these girls-- and there are fewer than you think-- it was just to make you jealous. He doesn't want to keep on living this absurd way. You decide. Either it's him, or it's her. He'll wait downstairs for a few minutes. If you don't come-- he'll leave, and never come back. Forever? Forever.
