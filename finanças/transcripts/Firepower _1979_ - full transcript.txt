[birds chirping] Fine. - Bye, bye. - Bye. Oh, hi Vito. Be right back. See you. [Horn honking] Hey, Vito! Hi. Are you coming to dinner tomorrow night? Well I see my brother all day as it is. But it's his birthday. Oh how could I have forgotten? You forgot. [Chuckles] - [Woman On Loud Speaker] Mr. Panker in research three to the telephone. Mr. Panker to the telephone please. [horn honking] Phone call for Dr. Wilkinson. Dr. Wilkinson to the telephone please. [explosion booms] [Adele gasps] [onlookers scream] [onlookers chattering] [glass breaking] [fire crackling] [fire alarm blaring] [somber organ music] [footsteps tapping] [mourners chattering] [footsteps tapping] [gun firing] [women screaming] [guns firing] [woman screams] [Woman] What happened? I can't believe it. [witnesses chattering] [mourners gasping] [ominous orchestral music] [mourners chattering] [sirens blaring] [dramatic orchestral music] [suspenseful jazz music] [sirens blaring] [Officer] Goodnight, ma'am. [suspenseful orchestral music] Mrs. Tasca, we think you may be in grave danger. We'd like to have you somewhere very safe. [passengers chattering] [man on loud speaker chattering] [suspenseful orchestral music] Your husband's research seems to prove that millions of dollars worth of pain killing drugs, marketed by the Stegner Corporation were contaminated. Now, years later, people who took those drugs are dying of cancer. Ivo was eight years with Stegner chemicals. [Frank] Mm-hm. When he left six months ago he took his proof. He said if anything happened to him I should get the evidence to you. Well, we have evidence the Mafia were paid to kill him. His brother should have left retribution to us. How long do we wait, Mr. Hull, for you to get Karl Stegner? He's the third richest man in the world Mrs. Tasca. That buys immunity. We're heavy with evidence, fraud, over $60 million worth, tax evasion, bribery. We were closing in but he left the States. And so far no country will send him back. You were brave to bring us these files. It's our duty to protect you now. That's the second offer of protection I've had in two days. Yesterday it was Karl Stegner. Stegner? Uh-huh. His security chief, Leo Gelhorn, gave me an air ticket last night. He offered sanctuary to me on the island of Antigua. Well you know that we can't help you over there. Nor can you get the man [siren blaring] who murdered my husband. Here is someone who can. Uh-huh, Jerry Fanon. [Adele] Do you know him? [Frank chuckles] Yes we used him once years ago when he was a bounty hunter. Someone jumped a half a million dollar bail, and Fanon got him back. The agency's had him on special cases. He used to do a lot for Sal Hyman, but he's retired now, gardening or something. Un-retire him. Huh, only Hyman can do that. Fanon owes him. [Adele] So ask Hyman. [reporters shouting] Now please, a little consideration. Is Mr. Hyman too ill to appear before the crime commission? Mr. Hyman's a very sick man. The justice department has just handed down 26 indictments against your client. Have you any comment? No comment, please. The attorney general yesterday named Sal Hyman, prime minister of organized crime. Can you comment? [Lawyer] No comment, no comment. [reporters shouting] Go ahead, get him. [reporters chattering] Hey, what do you think you're... [reporters chattering] [Man] What is this? [siren blaring] [Sal grunting] [air hissing] [Sal gasping] Very effective, Mr. Hyman. Mind if we watch, Sal? Hello Frank. Hello Sal. I hear you got some bad fish you wanna peddle. It's brotherhood week, Sal. Brotherhood? Mm-hm. We give you something, you give us someone. [birds chirping] [dog barking] Some place, Fanon. You like flowers, Sam? These are called impatiens. Hyman wants to see you. He says it's special, Fanon. [traffic rumbling] [horns honking] [door bell ringing] Hello Sam. The gardener made it, Sal. Jerry my boy. - [Sal chuckles] - Hello Sal. Let's have some breakfast. Mm, Ming Aralias, huh? Need a little water. Sam. Beautiful. You turned down a piece of the club in Vegas. Yeah, well ya know, can't grow much in the desert. I just wanted you to have something. - You gave me everything I wanted: Out. [Sal] Does the name Stegner mean anything to you? Money, oil, airlines. Tanker fleets, chemicals, nothing's too big. Or too dirty. The Attorney General's office wants him. The Securities Commission wants him. The Treasury Department wants him. He's very wanted. And very hard to get. 10 days ago I arrive in the airport. Those clowns in the Justice Department, they cut off my oxygen. [laughs] Not during one of you heart attacks? If I deliver Stegner to them alive I get a white sheet. No prosecution. [Jerry] But they don't even know what he looks like. They even say he's in Antigua. I have to have somebody I can trust. Listen Sal, you did me a favor 15 years ago in Miami I didn't even have to ask for. You saved my life. I'm calling it in now, Jer. Of course if it's too much for you... I'll get Stegner for you. I don't wanna abuse this thing we have. It's a contract. The fee, a million dollars. Inflation. [boat horn bellows] [recorder clatters] [boat horn blaring] A bit theatrical, Sal. Not anymore than the big drama you put on out at the airport, Frank. He was wired for sound. Uh-huh. We have company, huh? Don't let it bother ya. Let me get this clear in my mind. If I can deliver Stegner to officers of the Attorney General's office then the indictments against me will be dropped and I won't be hassled or harassed. That's right. Make the whole speech, Frank. - Now hold it, Sal. - No! You hold it. You want Stegner. You can't get him legally. You can't pull off a wild stroke in some foreign country because of a bad press, so you come to me, fine. But I don't play for a handshake. Okay. Okay. If you deliver... No, hold it, hold it, hold it. [chuckles] If you deliver Karl Stegner to law officers of the Attorney General's office, I am authorized to promise you that the indictments against you, Salomon Hyman, will not be pressed, and you shall not suffer harassment. Okay, Sal? Jerry Fanon meet Frank Hull. Del Cooper. - So you're this special Mr. Fanon. Everything we have on Karl Stegner. [boat whistle blaring] This is all I get? After you've studied that, you get the movie. The only known photo of Karl Stegner at 20 at a university dance. He always had a phobia about being photographed. [Jerry grunts] Foreign investigations against 16 Stegner companies were bogged down in the '50s. Suspected bribes to the United States judges, congressmen, senators, some later proven. [Jerry grunts] Oil tankers, estimated assets today top $800 million. [Jerry whistles] Six years ago Stegner left the U.S.A., first for this mansion in England, and then three years ago for this closely guarded house in Antigua. Efforts to extradite him have proved useless. [Jerry grunts] Associates: Leo Gelhorn, head of security and with Stegner since college. Paul Halpin, secretary and business advisor. Harry Calman, corporation lawyer. Here, we see Dr. Felix with Harry Calman. Dr. Charles Felix, Stegner's personal physician. Stegner, has a thromboembolic heart condition, subject to blood clotting. [phone ringing] All the major press cuttings on Stegner. A lot of it is fiction. Watch out for this man, he's head of security. If he thinks you're after Stegner, you can vanish suddenly. And remember, if you get into trouble, we'll sell you short. That's the way I always work. [radio music blaring] [radio announcer chattering] [Jerry knocking] [radio music blaring] [radio announcer chattering] Well, we're lookin' good, Eddie. I thought you were out of it. We're back. Here's your passport. You'll love it. Says you're Jerry Fanon. Where am I goin' with it? - [Woman On Loud Speaker] Announcing the arrival of American Airlines Flight Number 761 from New York. Passengers from this flight are now... - Mrs. Tasca, this is Mr. Halpin. Welcome to Antigua Mrs. Tasca. - Thank you. - Mrs. Tasca believes we had her husband killed. We? That's ridiculous. Who then? [Leo] Surely you can't believe a man of Mr. Stegner's stature would resort to murder. Only if his stature was being threatened. [Leo] But your husband presented no threat. His knowledge of the contaminated drugs did. [Leo] Ivo Tasca worked for Stegner Chemicals for eight years. He became obsessed by this fantasy that we knowingly distributed contaminated drugs. My husband was ready to expose Stegner. That's why Don Jenko was given the contract, to silence him. No, Mrs. Tasca. Don Jenko had an eight year old son. The boy was injured in an automobile accident. He was given drugs to ease the pain. Stegner drugs. Stegner drugs. [Adele] Mm-hm. The boy died of cancer two weeks ago. Don Jenko, like your husband, believed it was the drugs. He blamed the chief chemist, Ivo Tasca. Then when your brother-in-law gunned Don Jenko down, it became dangerous for you. All a tragic misunderstanding. [Adele chuckles] Now we wanna protect your life. Do you think you can? One thing more, Jerry. I think you should know who suggested you for this. Adele Tasca. She's in Antigua now. How does she look? Hi. Hello. Good morning. How is your Mr. Stegner? People say he doesn't exist. Well people are usually wrong. Could you show me around Stegner's villa, Mr. Halpin? I sign checks, madame, I don't open doors. Tell me Mrs. Tasca, why are you here? Why are you really here? To have you protect my life, Mr. Halpin. She could be a danger, Leo. Perhaps Oscar should remove her. [Leo] What do you mean by remove her, Paul? I think she's quite a threat. Well, I think she's quite magnificent. [suspenseful music] We're gonna wake some people up. [cable snaps] [alarms blaring] [sirens blaring] Come on hurry it up, huh? Four banks left to check. No we gotta stay here til we're relieved. Rules. I'll see you later. Take care. [slow funk music] You're gonna hate yourself in the morning. [suspenseful music] [electricity zapping] You got five minutes. Didn't anyone ever tell you it's wrong to steal? I'm just redistributing the wealth, man. [men laugh] Bridgeport, huh? Well, I imagine there's a lot of nice successful people here with a lot of nice valuable goods in that safety deposit vault. [laughs] Hey how'd you find me? [Jerry laughs] I heard you had developed a green thumb, was growin' tomatoes somewhere. I was. What brought you back? Got a gig. For Hyman? Yeah. You should've stayed away man. Could use some help. Money's thick. Hey I don't kill people. It's a grab, Karl Stegner. Ever hear of him? Karl Stegner? Well, my mother's child never was too bright. What's the wages? Think of a number. $100,000. You pay expenses. [Jerry laughs] - [Catlett laughs] - Done. I guess I could tell you now. I would have went for half that amount. Well I guess I can tell you now, I'd have paid twice that amount. [laughs] [Catlett] Hey man, aw it's good to have you back. [Jerry] Mm-hm. - [Woman On Loud Speaker] Announcing the arrival of British Airways Flight Number 3 from New York. British Airways Flight 3 from New York has just landed. [soft jazz music] [camera clicking] [Desk Clerk] Good afternoon, sir. Afternoon, Jerry Fanon. - Yes. - Beautiful woman, Mrs. Tasca. Have you been with us before, sir? No, but I'm glad I came. [fingers snap] Room 22. - I'm Manley Reckford, Mr. Fanon. How do you do? Sal Hyman said to give you anything you want. Thanks. Your man Eddie arrived. He's just like you. He's at my house. I brought you a gray Ford. You parcel for New York is behind the back seat. I want you check on a man named Dr. Felix. Find out where he is and what his habits are. Easy. I want it done softly, Reckford, softly. - Mr. Hyman said help you, Mr. Fanon. Anything else? I'll call you if I need you. Anything at all, Mr. Fanon. On these islands I'm the man. Reckford, are you expecting trouble? Or are they just a status symbol? [Reckford laughs] [suspenseful orchestral music] [crickets chirping] Catlett. Yo! - [head thuds] - Oh! Oh yeah, watch your head. [Jerry] Thanks a lot. How'd it go? No snags. Good, listen. Here's an address, Manley Reckford. You see him tomorrow morning. Who's this Reckford? Frog who thinks he's a prince. Runs messages for the families. So what do I want with him? I need some shots of Stegner's villa in close. Did you bring the camera? Well Reckford gets you in in a garbage truck. Check out these new arrivals. Norman here checked out Fanon's bag, found nothing unusual. But he did see Manley Reckford on the beach. I think we ought to check him out with Miami. Yeah do that, Oscar, then see Reckford. [sultry jazz music] Don't say I haven't changed. It's been 10 years. 12. 12? Yeah, you've changed. And don't say for the better. Where it shows, yeah. [laughs] Oh Jerry. You still know what a woman wants to hear. [chuckles] What was it you used to say you wanted? A nice quiet home in the country, children? I would have loved to have children. Never happened. It might have if... But you married the doctor. You got your respectability and security. Not my fault. It wasn't your fault. I just wanted the wrong things, I guess. Now you want revenge, huh? Justice. Justice? Justice? Yes. [Jerry laughs] Will you help me, Jerry, please? Well you're still very good, Adele. Very, very good. That little tremor you get in your voice when you say, "Help me, Jerry, please." Still very dangerous. Will you get Stegner back? I've got a contract on him. Thank you, Jerry. I'm not doing it for you Adele. I'm not interested in your justice. I'm doing it because I owe a man a favor, that's all! [Adele] It doesn't have to be like this between us. It doesn't have to be like anything between us. You'll get what you want. I want to help you here. Go back to New York, Adele. I don't need your help. Catlett's all I need. He's going to go in tomorrow, and get some shots of Stegner's villa. How? Collecting garbage. It's what we're down here for, isn't it? I won't say thank you again. [suspenseful music] Fanon's been talking to Adele Tasca. Does he know her? Didn't seem to when he arrived. We'll have a line on Fanon by tomorrow. Good. I wanna read him loud and clear. [visitor knocking] Mr. Gelhorn. Can we talk? I just spoke to Fanon. [Leo] Yes? His man Catlett has arrived. Good. Have they decided on their first move? Uh-huh, pictures of the villa. Tomorrow Catlett goes in with a garbage truck. Fitting. Well that's what Fanon said. My associate, Halpin, mustn't know anything, but I'll make sure Fanon gets all the help he needs. Well, play it very carefully, Leo. It mustn't look too easy to Fanon. He's a shrewd citizen. By the time you and I finish with Mr. Fanon, he won't be able to find first base in a first base factory unless we lead him to it. And lead him we will. [suspenseful music] Miami says that Fanon is Sal Hyman's man. Who is this Fanon, Leo? A new arrival at the hotel. Manley Reckford was quick to pay his respects. Reckford's tongue's always for sale. Not this time. If he's Hyman's man, he's syndicate. Nothing to worry us. I worry about anyone I can't catalog. Unless they have a beautiful body. What do you mean, Paul? The Tasca woman, she could make trouble. Could she, Leo? If I think so I'll correct it. [garbage truck rattling] [suspenseful music] [Catlett] How much longer we gonna look? [Jerry] If Stegner's in the villa we should find his pills. [Catlett] Here in about six weeks. [Jerry] If isn't labeled warfarin soda it'll have a yellow sediment in it. [Catlett] You used to be so much fun. [horn honks] [shoppers and merchants chattering] [upbeat music] [shoppers chattering] [woman laughing] - Ask. - Look at the camera. I wasn't ready, I was moving. - Good day, good day. [women chattering] [fabric ripping] [chicken clucking] Is that the woman from our hotel? [Woman] Yes it is. Help! - Help! - Something wrong isn't there? Help me, officer! [women chattering] That man attacked me, look. And grabbed my purse! Stop! [women chattering] I saw him, I saw him. - He grabbed you. - Did he do that to you? Hands together, hands together! [Man] I wasn't doing anything, I was just guarding her. I work for Karl Stegner! [visitor knocking] [Catlett] Hey, we got company. Adele, what the hell are you doing here? Were you followed? I got away. I've been talking to Gelhorn. From some things he said I'm beginning to think Stegner may not be on the island. Well you may be right. Who are those two? The honkey is Oscar Bailey out of Denver. He likes to hurt people. And the black's Lestor Wallace from Jamaica. He breaks legs. When do we move? Let's run it down. Stegner's entourage moves around the world, trumpets blowing, and everyone assumes that Stegner is cocooned in the middle of it. He has a serious thromboembolic condition, and has to take warfarin soda in regulated doses everyday. And no bottles of warfarin soda in the garbage we got from the villa. But we know that he doesn't make a move without his private physician Dr. Charles Felix. Reckford says that Felix hasn't been seen around here in months. Well it's a cinch if that doctor cat isn't there, Stegner isn't there. Could be stashed away in the house, but we can't get in to find out. Well if you can't get in, get everybody out. Easy lady. We're just gonna walk up to the house and serve everybody an eviction notice? Even easier: Burn them out. Is that what a quiet life teaches you? [Adele laughs] [suspenseful music] [dog barking] Bottom one. Cut it. [dogs barking] [Guard] Attack boy. [suspenseful music] [dart gun pops] [dog whimpers] [dart gun pops] [guard groans] [dog growling] [dart gun pops] [dog whimpers] [match crackles] [fuse hissing] [fire whooshes] [fire crackling] [men chattering] This is Karl Stegner's house! We're on fire and it's spreading. Get an engine up here quickly. I said quickly, dammit. [extinguishers hissing] [flames roaring] [Man] Now let's go. Come on, get outta here. [Security Guard] My monitors are out. Everything's dead up here. I'm gettin' out. [fire crackling] [men chattering] [Man] Over here, over here. [Man] Is anybody else up there? [Leo] This way. [Paul] Come on let's get outside. Let's go! [men chattering] [bell dinging] [firetruck bell blaring] [flames roaring] [Man] Get a move on, gotta move! [Leo] Let's get outta here. - Gotta break through. - Into the car. [Firefighter] Anybody get those tools? Let me get those tools over here! Get back, get back! Is anyone injured here? It's all right, everything's fine. [Firefighter] Okay, move over here. That's fine, over here. [firefighters chattering] Hurry up. [firefighters chattering] [fire crackling] Hurry up. [dramatic music] [fire roaring] [firefighters chattering] [fire roaring] [fire roars] [sultry jazz music] [Adele] How did it go? [Jerry] Just like the fourth of July. No Stegner. [Adele] You're positive? Well there were three rooms in use for Gelhorn, Halpin, and Calman. Now I didn't see Harry Calman, so he could have been in the car so people'd think he was Stegner. Well, if Stegner's not in the villa where is he? They'll be edgy after tonight, start making mistakes. That's when we'll find him. Gelhorn's gonna get mean. It's 4:30, you'll be missed. Drop her off somewhere near the hotel. You just sit tight 'til Catlett contacts you. I'll take the boat around to the old commercial docks. Okay? Take care of yourself, Fanon. I only get to see you once every 12 years. [soft jazz music] Well, the rooms in the north wing are untouched, we'll still be able to live here. But how did it happen? I've got two dogs and a man shot with tranquilizers. Somebody's been clever. Adele Tesca show up yet? At five o'clock this morning at the hotel. Is she still there? She was an hour ago. Bring her here. All right. [suspenseful music] Mr. Halpin wants to see you. Well tell Mr. Halpin I'm rather busy. Please, lady. Do you think this is worth $8? [jewelry clattering] [dramatic music] Man, you shoulda seen my legs. [men laugh] [Man] Jesus. Look over there. [dramatic music] [tires screeching] We're not alone. Don't worry, Fanon's up the road. He'll see us coming. [dramatic music] [horn honks] [fuse hissing] [Catlett] Now! [engine rumbles] [tires squealing] [explosion booms] It just blew up. I didn't see anyone or hear anything. [mumbles], though. She's down here with her own private shtarkers. Whoever that black is he's not a local for sure. [nurse muttering] We're supposed to have ears all over this island. Let's shake something out of it. Find out who that black is. - [Nurse On Loud Speaker] Will Dr. Dale Abbott please report to surgery? All right now, give it to me again. Wait a minute. We'll get the black and the Tasca woman. You want 'em brought back? They'd just vanish. Feeding time for the sharks. [soft orchestral music] [suspenseful music] Hope you can cook, lady. It's been a long time since I had a home cooked meal. Of course I can. [shoe crunches] [Catlett] Hey, watch your step here. [Adele] Yeah. [knee thuds] Oh! Who's gonna insure you, Catlett? [ominous music] Get the meat and stuff from the car. [Lestor] Okay. These bags are gettin' heavy. My old man used to say, "Things can get worse." Lestor. Take it to the boat. [suspenseful orchestral music] [dart gun pops] [henchman grunts] Now take good care of that one. Wait for me at Orange Bay. [ominous orchestral music] [fist banging] [crickets chirping] Mr. Reckford doesn't wanna be bothered now. Let me bother him now. Where is he? - [woman screams] - Fanon! Are you in business, Reckford, or are you retired? I wanna see you and Eddie now. [Manley] All right, all right. Jerry, well it's about time man. Hello Eddie. Putin on a little weight aren't ya? Housebound ya know. Well that's over. Here's some spending money. Eddie goes back to my hotel, he's me. You arrange I get a phone call from Miami requesting my presence back there immediately. Pick Eddie up tomorrow and take him to the airport. First, call Dominic Carbone in Curacao. Give him that message. In the morning, Eddie boards the plane for Miami, Fanon vanishes. Gelhorn will have the airport watched, so he won't have any trouble being seen. - [Woman On Loud Speaker] British West Indies Airline announces the departure of Flight 6 to Miami. Goodbye Mr. Fanon. Nice to have had you here. - [Woman On Loud Speaker] Passengers should have their boarding cards ready and proceed to gate number 12. Tell Mr. Gelhorn that Fanon has just boarded a flight to Miami. How long we gonna drift? Well, all the calls go through a scrambler right after the connection is made so all we get is the location. Most are obvious financial centers. But they called Willemstad in Curacao, six times the last four days. Once right after the fire. So you still think Stegner's in Curacao. Let's ask Lestor. Bring the barrel. You like sharks, huh? You booked the show, I'm just changing casts. It was Oscar's idea. Ask Oscar. [Suspenseful music] Yeah well Oscar was lucky. You're bait. Please, please, don't please. Please. Well you've got two minutes. Where's Stegner? God's truth, I don't know. Let's fish, Cat. [ominous orchestral music] Where is he? Where's Stegner? I can't tell you. I don't know. No! [Jerry] He's not in the villa. No, [mumbles]! Where is he? Where? [Lestor gasps] They say sharks can smell blood a mile off. Catlett don't do this to me, please. I can see a fin, Lestor. Looks like you just wasted your last two minutes on Earth. Where? I don't know. Mr. Gelhorn and Mr. Calman meet somewhere on the weekend. They say they're going fishing, but Oscar told me they see your man. Where? They don't tell me anything. Just they going fishing. Where is he? Start talking Lestor. Where is he? [Lestor moaning] Where is Stegner? Curacao. In Willemstad. [Lestor moaning] [soft orchestral music] Have you heard from Oscar yet? Has he found them? Paul, don't ever again send my people off to get anybody. You're a business advisor, I'm security. Remember that. I think you made a mistake, Leo. I told you days ago to kill that Tasca woman. Yeah I've always noticed it's you rich, soft, pampered people that are most in love with violence. You've never experienced it. You're voyeurs, you just wanna see it done. [sultry jazz music] Scrambled egg sandwiches. Terrific. A sky like that should make a sound, a brassy, goldy sound. When we hit Curacao, go around to the east side of the island. Gelhorn is gonna have the main harbor at Willemstad Watched so we can land right here. We got the harbor and the airport tightly covered, Leo. There's no sign of the woman or Catlett. Check the hotels? Done, every new arrival. Every place that's got a bed for sale. [soft jazz music] [tires crunching] Mr. Fanon? I'm from Dominic Carbone. He got your message. He asked me to welcome you to Curacao. [Dominic] You still take whiskey, Fanon? Yeah. [Dominic] Good. I didn't see his mouth move. Been a long time, my friend. Dominic Carbone meet Catlett. [Dominic] Pleasure. [Jerry] And Mrs. Tasca. - You're very beautiful, Mrs. Tasca. Thank you. And who's that one? Well I don't want him loose. Put him somewhere where he's safe. May I? Oh, help yourselves. Would you care for something, Mrs. Tasca? I'm very tired. I'd really like a bath and rest. Oh of course. Would you take Mrs. Tasca to her room? Thank you. [Jerry] So is it all fixed? Just like you asked me to. I have three rooms here for you. Nobody'll know you're in Curacao. Do you still have that sea plane? It's in a quiet bay on the east coast, Playa Marta, and I'll have it ready to fly when you want it. Good. I need some money, too. What about Karl Stegner? Do you know anything about him being in Curacao? [Dominic] People say he's on Antigua, but no one sees him. What about his doctor, Charles Felix? He comes in to play once in a while. He's got a plantation just outside Willemstad, about 20 miles north. Charlie likes chicken fights. He breeds them. Here I'll get his address for you. Take a drive up there this afternoon, Cat. I want it mapped. He comes in town quite regularly. I'll mark him for ya. Where does he stay when he's in town? The Plaza Hotel. He's got a suite on the 14th floor. Stegner uses it for his staff here in Curacao. Mr. Stegner, sir, I propose we move the whole entourage from Antigua to the house in Caracas. I think Paris would give us a better press coverage. I'll book two floors at the George V. Do we have the French government's cooperation? Oh, definitely. [Chuckles] Now about this, Catlett, Leo. We have his dossier from our police contacts. He's a thief, one of the best. What's his connection with the Tasca woman? We don't know sir. Oscar and Lestor were good together. To take them out, and we must assume that that's what's happened, would require someone really dangerous. You said Catlett was good. Men are what they do. He's no killer. I think we have an unknown cutting edge. Governments in my experience, when they want something bad enough, will sup in the devil's house. What do you think, Dr. Felix? When I was a boy my grandfather had a farm and I used to cut the meadow grass with a long, long scythe. But I always kept a clump of goldenrod standing near the stream for the butterflies. You see, I collected butterflies in those days. That goldenrod gathered all those butterflies in one place. Oh, it made it so easy. [blows out air] So easy. [visitor knocking] Who is it? [Jerry] Room service, ma'am. Oh. [Chuckles] A new dress, a new pair of shoes. A new pair of stockings. Listen I don't want to be ungracious but... You've been invited to Dominic Carbone's casino tonight, so. Oh. I hope they will fit me. Well if they don't you can use some of your many charms and sew. I'll try. You've got two hours. Okay. [sultry jazz music] [ball rattling] [upbeat soft jazz music] [gamblers chattering] He's at the dice table. Dr. Felix, in a beige coat and a brown shirt. Fanon, be discreet. This is my place. [gamblers chattering] [Woman] Where did you come from? I thought you were in Paris. [Man] Well, I got back just last week. What's that? I was playing 17. [Dealer] 17 black. [Woman] Did you know? [Man] What's better than Paris in the spring? It's only money. Next time. Ebony magazine, what the distinguished young man is wearing. Uh-huh. It's like a waiter from an Alabama chicken restaurant. In a ruffle shirt? [Jerry laughs] I look delicious. Felix and Calman are at the dice table over there. [chips clicking] When they leave, keep 'em company. But watch out, Calman may recognize your face. To them we all look alike. [ball rattling] Here's the layout of Felix's plantation. I think I'll double it. [Man] I always [mumbles]. [Woman] Yes, well [mumbles]. [ball rattling] [Dealer] 14 red. Ooh! [Jerry laughs] Here you are, John. Thank you, sir. [Dealer] Fair trade, settle three ways. [men chattering] [Adele] How nice, thank you. [Jerry and Adele laughing] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Mike] Good evening, sir. [Dr. Felix] There you are, Mike. Goodnight, gentlemen. I like to win occasionally. Tonight was my turn. Oh. Did I thank you for these? [sultry jazz music] Here, let me help you with that. When I take my earrings off, I go to bed. [Jerry chuckles] [audience applauds] [Spanish jazz music] Goodnight. Goodnight, Adele. [men chattering] Hey, [mumbles] is good here, ain't it brothers? [Group] Yeah! [Chattering] Yeah, I think I've got some fresh dollars here somewhere. [soft jazz music] [visitor knocking] It's open, Cat. Where ya been? Found a crap game at The Plaza. There's a funny thing about cooks and waiters. They're either dice shooters, horse players, or drunks. But there's one thing they all do is gossip, mostly to the heavy loser. I know as much about that hotel and Stegner's security arrangements as Mr. Gelhorn does. Very good. [audience applauds] Picked up another little tid bit. Found Felix and Halpin are goin' to a place called. La Via tomorrow, cockfight. Cockfight? Cockfight in La Via? Don't push that bottle too much. I want you bright eyed and clear headed for tomorrow. [Catlett] Oh what happened to the fun Fanon? [window rattling] You could pick up a lot of weight making entrances like that, honey. [sultry jazz music] [roosters clucking] - Come on, come on! [crowd cheering] Yeah thanks, brother. [crowd shouting] I'll take another $50. [crowd chattering] [roosters clucking] [Paul titters] [crowd cheering] Now. I won, Catlett, I won! Woo! - [crowd chattering] - Oh, hey. That's it, come on. [crowd chattering] Goodbye, Cyril, goodbye. [donkey braying] - [upbeat funk music] - There they are. All right. [engine rumbling] Sounds like they've taken the bait. [dramatic music] Okay, run. [door bangs] [Paul grunts] To the car. Open the door. Stegner's warfarin pills, huh? [suspenseful music] Into the other car, Doctor. Goodnight, Halpin. [dart gun pops] Sleep well. Get your things. Dominic'll drive you to the boat. Wait for us there. In case anything should happen and things should fall apart and we don't make it back, you go with Dominic. You'll be safe with him. - Yes but... - Now don't talk. Just do as I say. [crowd chattering] You're on, brother. [Man] Okay man. [Man] [mumbles] if somebody tries to hurt me. Gimme the gun. This is a Walther P38 with a silencer on it. No one will hear you die. Give me about five minutes. Then take the service steps to the first floor, then the penthouse elevator on up. [suspenseful music] [men chattering] [guests chattering] If we see anybody, just friendly hellos. Anything else makes me nervous. [elevator dings] [elevator clangs] [twinkling music] [suspenseful orchestral music] [dart gun pops] [security guard grunts] [dart gun pops] [security guard grunts] [man shouting in foreign language] [elevator dings] [Dr. Felix grunts] I've been trying for an hour to get through to New York. I don't care. [Catlett knocking] if the lines are busy. This is Gelhorn, now break in on somebody. I've gotta have a line right away. - [Harry] Lose your keys, Dr. Felix? Harry, this is our thief, Catlett, and he has a pistol uncomfortably against my spine. Hang up, Gelhorn. [Man In Gray Suit] How you gonna play this shot, nigger? You can't take both of us. [gun fires] [man in gray suit grunts] [Leo] Fanon? Let's go get Stegner. On the floor. Open it. You wanna be next, Gelhorn? [dial clicking] [door buzzing] What's your price, Mr. Fanon? I've been bought. I'll double your offer. Catlett! If we have any heroics here, gentlemen, Stegner will be the first to go. You heard, Fanon, wait. The only virtue of the stupid is they don't live long. [upbeat traditional music] [performers chanting] Harry, call the airport, have the helicopter ready. Tagua, come with me. What are you going to do, Leo? Fanon's efficient. He won't expose himself to a long sea voyage. That means he's got a plane waiting somewhere. [upbeat traditional music] [performers chanting] [Jerry] Let's go. [horn honks] [tires screech] [helicopter rumbling] We've got our men watching the departure gate. Get 'em and seal off the airport. [Driver] Right. [suspenseful music] [Jerry] Delivery day. Are you all right? Migraine. Have you anything to ease the pain, please? Yeah, there's some aspirin down in the first aid kit. [engine rumbling] [ominous orchestral music] [suspenseful music] That only leaves Playa Marta, the sea plane base. I know. [Man On Dock] Hi Fanon! See you in Miami. Okay. [helicopter rumbling] Adele, come on! [helicopter rumbling] [gun firing] [machine gun firing] [guns firing] [helicopter rumbling] Adele! [machine gun firing] [helicopter rumbling] [gun fires] Adele! Jerry, you go! I'll be all right. [gun firing] [airplane rumbling] [helicopter rumbling] [gun firing] [machine gun firing] [gun firing] [boat engine rumbles] [helicopter rumbling] [guns firing] [electricity zapping] [guns firing] [helicopter rumbling] [machine gun firing] [electricity zapping] [fire crackling] [somber orchestral music] Leo, why? Why? He was expendable. I had to make it look good. [explosion booms] [suspenseful orchestral music] Firefly, firefly, subject landing now, Watson Island Base, Miami. Repeat, subject landing now. Let's go. [Officer] Suspect's sea plane has come ashore. Suspect and escort are leaving sea plane now. I have offered you more money than you can count, Fanon, deposited anywhere in the world. Dreams, freedom, and power, Fanon. Any man who refuses what you've just refused is reckless with his future. Gentlemen, this is Karl Stegner. He's gonna offer you the world, so take good care of him. - Let's go. - Let's go. There's a vehicle waiting for ya. I'll show ya. [suspenseful music] - [Woman On Loud Speaker] Delta Airlines. You go ahead, I'll get my things. [Woman On Loud Speaker] Please report to flight administration. Delta Airlines, [mumbles]. [gun firing] [tires screeching] [gun firing] [gun fires] [man groans] [potatoes rumbling] [tires screeching] [gun firing] [man groans] [guns firing] [woman crying out] [officer groans] [gun firing] [tires screech] Delta Airlines, Captain Ridgeway, please report to flight administration. We got trouble, Jerry. [Jerry] What? Someone burned Stegner yesterday out at the airport. Hull is pointing the finger at us. We clean, Sal? Like virgins, Jerry. Only you knew he was coming in. Your people knew. Stegner's group in Curacao could've guessed it. Why should we have hin killed, Frank? He could bruise you you've done business with him. Stegner can't put anything on us. You look somewhere else for your killers. Like where? A couple of damaged bankers, at least two state governors, three senators I can name and a dozen lobbyists. Stegner bought up a lot of slack in his operation. People right up at the top could've been hurt when he unraveled. Maybe somebody in your office got patriotic. We get you to bring him back so we can kill him? It scans. We wanted Karl Stegner for prosecution. In my book you delivered him for burial. That's how I'll advise my department. - Are you all right? - Migraine. Have you anything to ease the pain, please? Yeah, there's some aspirin down in the first aid kit. [suspenseful orchestral music] Has there been an autopsy on Stegner yet? [Coroner] The orbital cavity has been shattered. There's extensive brain damage. Doctor, did you find any other hemorrhaging? I mean, hemorrhaging not consistent with the gunshot wounds. Definitely not. What's this all about, Fanon? This isn't Stegner. What? It's a stand-in. We've been taken for a carnival ride. [Frank] What's going on here? I'm lost. What would happen, Doctor, if a man taking warfarin sodium took four or five aspirin? He'd have massive hemorrhaging. Well Stegner had been taking warfarin sodium for three years. This John Doe took four aspirin for a migraine about eight hours before he was shot. His body was to be used as a punctuation mark, a period, Hull. Stegner dead, a few daffodils, pretty soon everyone forgets. They saw us comin', man. We've been used. Do you know who Stegner is? Who and where. Well they know you now. That makes you the fish in the barrel. You better go back to your gardening. Hull and Cooper will pick you to pieces, Sal. I still got my heart attacks. And I still owe you Stegner. [phone rings] What do you need? Dominic's plane boat's still in town. That's all I need. You got two more reasons to go now, Fanon. That was Dominic Carbone. Your friend Catlett's body was found burnt with his boat. Gelhorn has the Tasca woman, Catlett's dead. [somber orchestral music] [suspenseful orchestral music] [horse whinnies] [knuckles knocking] Darling? What's wrong, dear? Nothing. Well you left the table so abruptly. Headache. Yes, I know, it seemed to hit you when we got the news my unfortunate stand-in was killed in Miami. He'd saved you the five million. The five million he was to get to serve time instead of you. Well I tell you, Adele, I'd grown fond of my double. [dog barking] Yes, I truly forget his tragic accident. - Accident? - Yes. Like Catlett? My husband? [dog barking] I love you, Karl. I wanted help your rebirth as Dr. Felix. I wanted to spend the rest of my life quietly with you. [dog barking] But so much blood. Did you have to? Now wait a minute, nothing is for nothing, Adele. You know that. Did you really think that it would be easy? Well, no matter. From now on, my dear, it will be. Just like we always spoke of, you'll see. [dog barking] I know, Leo, you heard voices. You thought there might be burglars. I heard words. Indeed. What did you hear? Enough to make me think perhaps Halpin was right, right when he said she could be dangerous. He doesn't know just how dangerous. You realize don't you, Karl, that beside me she's the only one who knows you're Stegner. [Karl] I wanna think about that Leo. [suspenseful orchestral music] [horse hooves clomping] Ha! [Guard] Whoa! - Who killed Catlett? [guard grunting] Who killed Catlett? [coughing] Gelhorn. What room is Dr. Felix in? [guard grunting] I'll get him anyway. Where is he? [guard grunting] Out the back. [door creaks] [guard gurgles] [gun thuds] [Karl chuckles] You know Leo, when I first met Adele Tasca I was playing a part, of course. I was Dr. Felix. We became friends and then shortly afterwards I told her who I really was. I always remember what she said to me at that time. She wasn't thrown or anything. She just looked at me and she said, "You know, Mr. Stegner, I've always admired men" "with power and wealth." That's what she said to me. Utterly amazing woman. Utterly amazing woman. [chuckles] [tractor rumbling] [guns firing] [building crashing] [guns firing] [man cries out] [guns firing] [stairs crashing] [Karl grunts] Get up, Stegner. You're making a terrible mistake. No, I'm correcting a mistake. I should've known when they didn't blow you and Catlett away to save Stegner. I wouldn't have snatched the warfarin pills from my hand. I should have known you were Stegner then. Halpin! You go get Mrs. Tasca. You rest of you put your guns on that table and put your arms straight out from your shoulders. You heard him, gentlemen. Do it. How badly you want her, Fanon? Bad enough to kill him if you don't put that gun on the table. Fanon, you do surprise us. Put those on him. Why don't you walk away now Fanon and stay alive to be a wealthy man? No, no, no, I'm going to deliver you. You won't stay in jail long. Men like you never do. You buy the judges, you buy the lawyers. If that doesn't work you buy the men above them. So as long as you're alive there's hope. [horse whinnies] [ominous music] Go to the red Jeep. Get in. Do you drive? I'll try. Stand on it. Stand on it! Yes, I'm trying to. [gun firing] [horses whinnying] [suspenseful orchestral music] [Paul] What the hell's going on? Why does Fanon think Dr. Felix is Stegner? Because he is, you idiot. Why? When? So he wouldn't have to stay holed up with you all day. Fanon's got him for Christ's sake! [suspenseful music] - [Jeep thuds] - Whoa! [Adele laughs] What are you laughing about, Adele? Let's go, come on. [Adele] It's not easy. [Jerry] Come on! Harry, take the helicopter. - Right. - Find out where they are and report in. Paul, call the police. Have 'em cut off the roads. You men seal off the banana fields. I don't want any accidents. Take them, don't start a shooting war. [suspenseful music] [Harry] Calman to base. I can see them now. They're going west through a patch in plantation seven. We'll keep with them. Ooh. [dramatic orchestral music] [gun firing] [man cries out] [Harry] Calman to truck three, they'll be passing you in 10 seconds. Right. [suspenseful orchestral music] [truck crashing] [explosion booms] Helicopter to police car on Julianna Road. Suspects are coming up behind you in a red Jeep. Follow them and keep them in sight. [suspenseful orchestral music] [tires screech] [horn honking] [truck crashing] [siren blaring] Helicopter to white Jeep, suspects are turning towards [mumbles] River. Keep with them. [water splashing] [explosion booms] [Jeep crashes] [ominous music] You all right? Come on. Let's go. [soft suspenseful music] [fire crackling] [Karl grunting] I can't breathe, my chest. You're not dyin' here, Stegner. Get up, come on. My chest. [Breathing heavily] [horse whinnies] [ominous orchestral music] [Karl breathing heavily] [Jerry grumbling] [Harry] They're on foot running through Jacobs Plantation towards Pigeon Bay. We've got three horsemen catching up with them. [explosion booms] [dramatic orchestral music] [horses whinnying] [suspenseful jazz music] [Jeep rumbling] Come on. This is Jeep number three. I'm on Pigeon Bay. I'm approaching the three of 'em. He's got a sea plane here. They're running towards it. I'm about 100 yards away. I can catch him... [explosion booms] [Leo] Pigeon Bay. Hold that on him, I'll untie the plane. Now. Now darling, now. Darling? Stegner's deep freeze mistress? Adele Tasca? Put your hands on your head, Fanon. I never trust a man like you, Fanon. Every second you're alive you're a danger. Get too hot in the kitchen for ya, huh Stegner? Had to set up that poor stand-in. You bore me. [gun fires] [gun firing] [Karl grunting] Ow, my arm. Unh-unh, you change sides too often. [Jeep rumbling] [suspenseful orchestral music] Start pumping. [Adele] Pumping? [gas splashing] [gun firing] [Jerry] Keep pumping. [suspenseful orchestral music] Will you turn me in, Jerry? Will you? No, I owe ya. [plane rumbling] [guns firing] Try for Fanon only! [guns firing] [dramatic orchestral music] [flare gun pops] [men crying out] [party goers chattering] I mean none of us are safe. If they can get Karl Stegner, the richest man in the world for a little thing like tax evasion. And fraud, Emily. I don't care. It shows that nothing is sacred. Weren't you out there on that island where he was? [Adele] Mm-hm. Isn't that Harold Everett? Did you see that list in Newsweek? Isn't he the fourth richest man in the world? Or is the fifth? I think it was the fourth. - Harry, may I introduce Mrs. Adele Tasca. Mrs. Tasca, it's a pleasure. You know, Mr. Everett, I've always admired men with power and wealth. [Harold] Hm. Mm-hm. [Adele and Harold laugh] It's a pleasure. [suspenseful jazz music]
