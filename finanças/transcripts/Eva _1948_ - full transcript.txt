I was on my way home, to mom, dad, and Frida. And my little sister Lena, who was only 7 years last time I saw her. The more I approached the world of my childhood, the more the grandeur of the city disappeared. Here is Djur?sen. It's become so small! Everything seems smaller. You talk as if you've been gone for 50 years! It's been two years. I've been in the navy in Gothenburg for two summers. And this summer? I'll take a hiatus and get another job that pays better. What will you do? - Musician at the amusement park. - That sounds nice. It's funny. At first it was so great to leave home. And now it's great to return. Yes, but not for longer than a short-term leave. No, maybe not. Maybe it isn't that great after all. At first, it's just distress. Then it increases and turns into something else. A shadow that becomes darker the closer I get to home. A shadow that I cannot escape and that has haunted me since I was only 12 years old. Dad! I've driven Anna by myself, all the way from L?nnheden! Bo and Frida, come to the table! Bo, come in immediately! Mind yourself, lass! Have you told Anders that you play with dolls? You're lying, punk! You're the punk, liar! All is in order. So, the train leaves at 7 pm. - Good evening. - Good evening. Stop the train and go home or your mother will be upset. - Mom is never upset. - Put the brake on anyway. Soon you will be able to drive it by yourself. - Good evening. See you tomorrow. - Goodbye! Sleep well! - Don't scratch the bite! - It feels so good! You heard me. It's already as big as a bun. Surely you scratch your belly a lot. Eat and stop saying silly things. When I grow up, I will have my belly full of babies. - You can only have one at a time. - Aunt Ellen had two of them! That was an exception. Aunt Berglund's cat is a large exception then. It had eight kittens! lmagine that you had eight babies. What would you do then? I would ask Bo and you to help me. - Does he drink inside your belly now? - Eat! - The director just passed by. - Yes, I saw that. He didn't even come in to say hello. - Maybe he was in a hurry. - He visited Ingelson in Bomtr?sk. - Maybe he had an errand? - No, he passed us by to make a point. - Of what? - He is demonstrating. You are in disfavour if you don't have the same political opinions. - He doesn't care about that! - Pah! Mom! Did you see that I drove old Anna by myself? No, but I can tell by the dirt on your nose! You sure look handsome! And look at your shirt! Have a sandwich. I don't know if I like that you fling around on the locomotives. What's the harm in that? - Why can't I do that? - I think I understand that better than you. Not to mention the ugly words that you scream to your sister. - Especially at the train station. - She started it! No, it was you! Bo is a liar! - You are the liar! - Quiet! Keep your sandwich to yourself! - It was your fault. - Quiet, Bo! - You're not very clever. - No? You are 12 years old. You live and eat at home. When I was your age... - I know. And I know that... - Quiet, Bo. Something prevents me from hitting you. I can't explain what it is. You deserve a thick ear now! But you are stronger than me. Listen, Bo. Tell me why you act like this. Because you scold me when it's your own fault. You're talking about the sandwich? Yes, I was wrong. And there are other things too. Don't cry. - I'm not crying. - What is it, Bo? - You behave oddly. - Leave me alone! Bo says that mom is the most beautiful woman in the world! - Stop! - Don't talk like that to your mother! I hate you all! I don't give a damn about you! Aren't you ashamed? Are you out of your mind? Bo! Come back! I'll never go home, Kay. Come. Atta girl, Marthe! You inherited the talent of your father. - Want some chocolate? - Yes, please. - What is your name? - Bo. Bo Fredriksson. - How old are you? - I am 12. - Almost 13. - I am 10. Here is Marthe, my daughter. My name is Josef. And here are my brothers, Fritz and Karl. Friedel's fabulous Tyrolian Trio! - Good day. - Good day. - Good day. - Want something to eat? - No, thank you. I am not hungry. - But I am. Would you allow me to have breakfast? Of course. We can talk, if you want. - What was your name again? - Bo. - You are not from Sweden. - No, I am from Austria. But I was 2 years old when I came here. What does your father and his brothers do? They play and sing in the amusement parks. Have you always been... - Have you never been able to see? - No. Can't you see the sun? No, but I feel it on my skin. And I feel the smell of the forest. We just passed a red cottage! It looks like a large wild strawberry. The wild strawberries are good! And beside the house, there are poppies. Poppies? What's that? They are large red flowers. Red? - Don't you know red? - No. It is angry and happy. Blood is red. And barns, and farms. It is a sharp color. - Like the sound of a trumpet? - Exactly. - I'll be back. - Where are you going? I'm helping to drive the train. Bo! Aren't you coming back? Yes, as soon as we speed up. Here is the coffee! That will do until the last number. But then we'll have a drink! - Won't you play afterwards? - Just for an hour. Then we'll do whatever we want. Anything you want. We'll see about that then. - It is me, Bo. - Hello. Another one comes to hear the renowned Tyrolean Trio of Friedel! I wanted to ask if Marthe and I could take a walk. I see. But first we have to examine you. Come here! - Are you afraid? - I am never afraid. You sound merciful. Give me your hand. It is a very ordinary hand. You will become a rather hard and wise, but open-minded man when you grow up. I see that the lines of love and death often entwine. Besides that, it is an ordinary hand. Sorrow and joy will come to you in equal quantities. Well, it doesn't look so bad. - Do you believe in this? - No, I don't believe in adults. You don't like adults? No. All adults are mean. I know. - But you like Marthe? - Oh yes, we'll marry! And what would I do without Marthe? - You will come to see us. - How kind, Mr. Fredriksson! Since you're getting married, you can go for a walk. Thank you. But don't run away from her, Mr. Fredriksson. Oh no! - See any danger in this one? - Yes. For me. I see a meeting with a dark, handsome man. - Glowing passion. - Money? A wedding? No, no money and no wedding. Only pleasure! Why don't you like grown-ups? Grown-ups only want to put you into place. Are you never afraid? No. I am often afraid. - Of what? - There's something terrible about my dad. One day, he hung himself up in a rope from the roof. Uncle Karl took him down. - Why? - He was sad. Mom escaped two years ago with his cousin. - Do you know where they are? - No, and it doesn't matter! - Is Kay your friend? - Yes. - My only friend. - You have me too. Why are you doing that? I am your friend too. Bo, what are you doing? Where are you going? I'm running with the horses! Watch out, they might kick you! They enjoy it! No wedding, only pleasure! Was it dad? I won't tell. Don't cry. I am so stupid. Have you ever thought of fleeing? I can't. - I fled. - Yes, but you can see. I can see for you. Marthe, we'll run away from your father and everything! Why do you want to take me along? Because I like you. I don't want anyone to be mean to you. I don't like your father. He is creepy. No, don't say that! I am so scared of fleeing. - Trust me. - I trust you. - If you want, I'll come with you. - Come, I have a plan. We must get to dad's station before it gets light. - Did it take long? - A little, but I had Kay. I had to find some food. - Are you cold? - No, it's warm here. The pressure is perfect now. Let's go! - Can you drive a train? - Of course! - How did you learn? - The railwaymen showed me. Let's go! Isn't it dangerous? Oh no. - Now we're moving! - How exciting! Just wait until we get the speed up! - Are you scared? - Not now. Let's keep moving then. Hey! You look peevish. Goodbye. Dad! Hello. - Hello, Lena! - Bo! Mom! Frida! Bo arrived! Welcome! It's so great to have you here! Everything's in order. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Fredriksson. You're so heavy! Let's have some coffee and a sandwich. You must be hungry. They served coffee on the train, but it was just a substitute. We only serve real coffee. Let me have a look at you. - Isn't he handsome? - Oh yes! Turn around! Let's have coffee now. Girls, come and help me. - Did you see the fridge? - Pride of the family! - Welcome, boy. - Thank you. - Glad to be here? - Yes! It was hot in the train. Aren't you tired from the trip? - It's great in Stockholm, isn't it? - Oh yes, you should come there. Back in the days, the officers were tough. But now you're an officer! We'll get you a sandwich with homemade brawn. Did you see the fridge? What's so funny? Anything new? There is a new express train but it does not stop here. Lena got rid of her appendix, but you already know that. Sit properly. - Cheers, Bo! - Thank you. - Is it Norrland? - No, it's ordinary schnapps. Everything tastes the same nowadays. - Or else, nothing new? - No, it's as usual. - Uncle Berglund is dying. - Really? Two weeks ago he caught pneumonia and he's facing the end. So aunt Maria has to manage the farm by herself? Oh no, Eva has returned. Oh, really? She helps with the farm now that Bengt is in the army. - Will you see them? - If I have time. - I will inspect the accessories. - You will do what? - Have a look around. - It is well, my boy. You didn't drink up. Make a speech, dad! It is good to have you here. Welcome. That wasn't a speech! - Goodbye. - Let me follow you. - No, not tonight. - Why? No, another time. "A look at the accessories". Is that why he's taking a short cut? - What do you mean? - Look! Oh, I see. Eva. A pretty girl. But that doesn't have to make her an "accessory". It's not the first time that I walk along this path, to this exact spot. There's nothing to see here, Yet I must come stand here and remember. Never forget that death is a frightening and dark reaper. Never forget. Eva! - Are you here? - I'm on a leave. I can see that. Welcome home. Thank you. - And you're an officer, too. - Those things happen. - How are you? - Well. And you? Grandfather is ill, but granny and me are fine. - You're back in school? - Yes. But I had to quit when Bengt was summoned. - Is it hard work? - Yes, I'm always busy. But it is rather fun. I didn't expect you to come here all of a sudden. - Are you happy about it? - What do you think? You've become pretty. I like you. I like you too. Now you've made a mess. Now you'll have to visit grandma and grandpa. - Must I? - Oh yes! Or granny will be sad and upset. - I'm not spoiled with help. - Don't you want to be spoiled? What do you think? Does it taste anything? Bland. Can you imagine, Bo Fredriksson is coming to see us! I'd better make coffee. - I have a guest for you. - Yes, I saw you. Good evening, aunt Maria. - How is it? - I'm alright. But grandfather will probably leave us soon. - Who's leaving us? - You! We'll see about that! It is far gone. If he lives through the night, it would be unusual. - Say hello while I make coffee. - It's fine, thank you. What happend to your manners? You will have coffee. Pass me the pot. Good evening, uncle Aron. It is Bo Fredriksson. Go-getter! Sit down. Shouldn't you send for a doctor? He already prescribed medicine for him. That's all he can do. What's on your lip? Just a small sore. But that's fresh! Sores on the lips are strange. I know somebody who often had them. And just like that, they'd sit there with a snapper. It's not that kind of wound. No, I don't think so either. - And you are in good health? - Oh yes, thank you. The military service is tough? - I understand that you are a musician. - Yes, trumpet player. Oh, you play the trumpet! That's a beautiful instrument. That's one hell of a blabbering! He's at a municipal meeting. Should we build a new school? Or not? Can you play this? I think so. Why? It would be so kind if you could play for grandpa. I will try. Bo is playing you a piece of music. That was beautiful. Thank you. If I would read for him as well... How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage. As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. Read on your own. I want to be alone and change clothes. Is she sad? No. But a part of her dies, and it makes her touched and solemn. I feel stupid. I don't believe in all of this. Yet it somehow is right. But you can't explain, it's just the way it is. One behaves so strangely. And one becomes embarrassed when running into the simple things. There is something called the "proximity of death". Do you feel it? It's horrible! No, it isn't. I have to laugh now... You couldn't even build an outhouse! And you are explaining to us how to plan the new school! The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness, for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. - We're driving fast now. - I can feel that. You are very adept. There was nothing I could do! I didn't want to! Erik! He should be on an institution! He's an idiot! Should we take her to the doctor? What good would that do? It will pass. Come, my lover, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages. Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom - there I will give you my love. Is that what it says? - It's the Song of Solomon. - It's beautiful. Yes, it is. Did you drop something? Maria? I guess it's over soon. You shouldn't be sad. Because when you're gone, I'll have no more joy on earth, and I will follow you soon. Are you still disturbed by death? Yes, it is dreadful. It's like a shadow behind you that grabs ahold of everything. - Everything must die. - Perhaps we go on somewhere else. I do not believe in that. I do not believe in God. - Then it's hard to believe in anything. - No, not usually. But since I was 12 and the accident happened... Since then I've always hated death. I've never been afraid of it. I feel for you. But I think you'll sort it out some day. Come. Do you remember a midsummer's day when we danced together? No. Do you remember an autumn's day when we walked along the lake and ate cloudberries? - Why? - Do you remember? No, I don't think so. Do you remember when we met a kit fox 9 years ago, and you kept it in your desk and was punished for it? Why are you asking me all this? You're an idiot. Look at me. It's the only thing I've done all evening. - It makes me cross-eyed. - Go home then! Go to bed with your proud nose in the air. Leave me alone! I am so stupid that no sane person should care about me. But I want to tell you something. I've never been with a woman. Does that sound ridiculous? Over there in the barn you said that you liked me. We kissed both there and inside the house. Yes, but it was less complicated then. It is more complicated now. I thought you didn't complicate things. No, not before, but now everything is very complicated. You make me feel indecent and irresponsible. But I suppose that I am. What if you'll get pregnant? That's a minor concern. How can you know that it won't be a disappointment? - There has to be a first time. - Yes, of course. I won't say another word! There is no problem, it's just something inside of me that I make up. For love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame. Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned. You should go. Can't you stay a little longer? I have a lot to think about. Please don't be angry with me because of that. I understand. I already long for our next meeting. Me too. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What time is it? 7.15. Hurry, I don't want to be late. One should never sleep after dining. - And it's so warm. - Warm? It's hot as Africa! Bo, wake up! It's 7.15. You should go in and wake him. Why that tone? I don't have a tone. Don't say anything then. I suppose that I could go and wake him, if you insist. To be married to you, darling... Shame about that, darling! - Where are the cigarettes? - I can't hear you! You sneak up on me like a dirty old man! - But I am one. - I know. - Where are the cigarettes? - I don't have any. - I bought a package this morning. - You did? I guess they're consumed. Shouldn't you put on a dress before you go in? Idiot. Time to wake up, Bo! Go away! How friendly one can be! I will at least pull up the blinds. Why do you come here, undressed? G?ran didn't like it either. Listen to me well, G?ran is my friend and you are his wife. You love him and he loves you. Stop trying to sleep with me. G?ran is my friend, you see. You think I'm a bad girl, but I'm not. You know that as well as I do. I have never been with anyone but G?ran. And I do love him. I know that he is your friend. But it is something that's entered my mind. I don't know what. You've become insane, that's all. Anyone can get insane in this heat. Perhaps. Nice breasts! But not as nice as mine. Shouldn't you go? She doesn't show her legs. Maybe that's just as well. Give me that! It took an awful lot of time to wake you up, Bo. But then again, Susanne always does her things thoroughly. We were talking about the weather. A thunderstorm is coming. I think I'm moving out of here. I don't think that would help. It's not good to have your fianc?e so far away. - Bring her here. - Easier said than done. She can't leave her grandmother. She runs a farm on her own. Then find someone else in the meantime. - You are really cynical, G?ran. - Perhaps. I've always found biology to be of secondary interest. I haven't. Susanne tickles your biology at least. Shut up! I told you that I'm moving. You are incredibly jealous and yet interested, no? Maybe I am. Susanne just called me a dirty old man. She's not as stupid as you think. - Anyone want a drink? - Not me, thank you. - And you, darling? - Please. I would've thought so. Cheers! Tell me, darling? Don't sound like that. I've gotten so strange lately. It's not that I am bored. And it's not that I'm stupid. Get dressed now, so we can get going! Nobody wants to talk about my soul, even though it's so damn interesting. - Why are you screaming? - It's just life. Now it's Bo! Quiet! What a lousy radio you have! I'll tell you, my girl, I had this radio before you were born. The noise is caused by the atmosphere. Not even the newest radio could do anything about it. - Quite the contrary. - Quiet! - Is it over? - The applauses! - What a round of applause! - Bo will have to bow to the crowd. But I don't really understand it. - Your train is here, Eva. - Hurry! - What about the call? - You'll have to do without it! - But then he won't know I'm coming! - It will be a surprise. - Say hello from me! - Hurry, hurry! - Let it be. - I didn't forget anything? They say it's immoral, but it isn't! What is immoral? I may be drunk, but I'm perfectly sane. What is immoral? - You're so irritating. - This is it: Susanne has what you might call an "erotic curiosity" about you, Bo. - You're out of your mind! - Fair enough. But I happen to be part of this. The husband generally plays the idiot. Thus, I turn it inside out and say: Go ahead! - I don't understand. - You have my blessing. We are educated and modern people, damnit. - Are you serious? - Of course, my dear. Of course I am serious. Very serious, even. That's so filthy! You treat me as if I were a piece of furniture. - Aren't you? - You scumbag! - So what do you say? - I feel ridiculous. That's the whole point. I'm not sure that you've thought enough about this. - What if we fall in love? - That won't happen. I know Susanne and I know you. - Do you? - Very well then. Let's change the subject. I just wanted to spread some light in the moral darkness. But if you like darkness, knock yourselves out! I suggest that we get drunk. Cheers, then. My little darlings. Well? What do you say now? Admit that I was right. - Admit! - No! It was quite pleasant, don't you think? Yes, it is true, it was quite pleasant. It would be even more pleasant in my room. Are you coming? Watch the furniture. Even a simple country boy like me knows that it's difficult to compromise theory and reality. Come, Susanne. - What do you want? - G?ran fell asleep in the kitchen. - Help me put him to bed. - Let him sleep there. No, he can't. Why? I think the gas pipe is leaking. I'll help you. I can't see you. Come. After all, he's just a predator. A malicious beast of prey. Shouldn't we put him to bed? - He can stay there. - But the gas pipe is leaking. No, it isn't. I don't understand what you mean. I just mean that it might start leaking. And if he remains here, and the door is closed... There are no windows in here. Accidents often happen. The gas is so toxic. We can't help if anything happens. Susanne! Open! You have killed G?ran. - Now, you must obey me. - It was your idea! - I just said what you thought. - You helped me! You cannot prove it. Burn this. - Don't open! - We have to. I don't dare to. No! If we only hadn't done this... Creep! Damn weather! Damn headache! - Are you opening the door? - I'm running, darling! You have a visit! I didn't do it! I didn't want to kill him! Oh, what a hangover! It was you! I didn't want to! Dreams are strange. Are you here? It was a surprise. It sure was! Do we have some aspirin? - Have you looked in the toolbox? - I will look in the bread bin. You see, Miss, it got a little festive yesterday. I can imagine that. May I come in? I will close the door. Have a good time! I was supposed to go to the hairdresser today. Then to the post office and then visit my aunt. But I think I'd prefer to sleep. Mom's little cutie! - Isn't it better to sleep on a day like this? - Yes! I'll tell you about the guy who was on a honeymoon in the rain. - Not so loud! - Oh, you've heard it! Yes, I have! - Darling, you are incredible! - Hey, now! Keep calm now! - Are you moving? - You'd better believe it. - Tell me now. - There's nothing to tell. - It's just darkness and shame. - I don't believe it. Deep inside of me there is something terrible that I can't come to terms with. Something that emerges and looks at me with sinister eyes. - Then I don't know what to do. - Everyone has it. No, not you. That's why we all become so small and sleazy next to you. It's just your hangover. Don't joke. It's something that I can't come to terms with. I cannot explain it. Take a shower and I will pack your bag. Don't go out of your way for me, dear Anna! Oh, it's nothing. I guess you want some news about Bo and Eva. We got a letter today. Oh, of course I would. - Anything new about B?sna? - Not really. Nothing happens there. I heard that they will have a new priest. - Good evening, Maria. - Good evening. How is your sister in B?sna? She has surved her purpose. You want news about Bo and Eva, I suppose. - Here you go, aunt Maria. - I left my glasses at Berta's! I will read it to you. She's so excited that she forgot to mark it with the date! Save your remarks for later! Give me this letter, there will be less blah. I can take it, mom. I read what's in the letter, end of story! The postmark is dated the 5th. - Anyway. Yttersk?r. - The 5th. We know that by now, Mr. Fredriksson! Bo and me are still out on our island, having a wonderful time. Bo is a very gentle and attentive husband. He helps me in every way. My belly has grown very large, but it doesn't matter as long as Bo finds me pretty. There are heavy winds every day and Johansson, the only one who lives here, can't get his fishing nets out. We eat canned food and milk Johanssons cow. Sometimes we hear mines exploding on the open sea. It sounds horrific and reminds us that there's still a war. Bo takes a bath every morning and I wish I could do that too. That one hasn't been in the water for long. Still looks like a human being. He could be from the German boat that was blown up yesterday. Possibly. And he is young. Poor father. Damn war! We'll take him to the boat shed in the meantime. Hello! You are served. Let me put some clothes on. What were you and Johansson doing? - Oh, nothing. - You carried something. A log came up to the surface. The old man saves those things to make fire in the winter. - It's so windy. - Yes, but it is beautiful. Yes, but it's also worrying in some way. - Don't you think so? - Do you miss the city? Not really, but you get so silly in my condition. You're either very happy or very sad. - You are very sad today? - In some way. - I don't know what it is. - We'll return when the wind subsides. Not for me. You won't be a father for another three weeks. The coffee's getting cold. You know how capricious us women are. I'm bringing some food to Johansson. I suspect he's just drinking schnapps and eating potatoes. - He smelled funny today. Should I go? - No, I'll go myself. You're pampering me. - It won't be a boy. - It will be a boy. - You will be disappointed if it is a girl. - No. I will be content even if it is a kitten. You're silly! Be careful, the cliffs are slippery. Yes, my prince. I will practice outside. Yes, my trumpet player. Goodbye! You're not sad anymore? No, my gentleman. Just a little. But that will pass. Here's some food for Mr. Johansson. - How are you? - As good as possible in this dreaded place. Tell me, Johansson, I saw you carrying something with Bo. Towards the boat shed. What was it? Oh, that. Didn't Bo tell you? You are both acting strangely! What was it, then? Nothing that concerns you. Go home to your place. - Good evening, Mr. Johansson. - Good evening. Eva? He wasn't older than you. And I thought that it might as well have been you. It's so incomprehensible that people are killing each other. I don't believe that anybody really wants to. And then it seems so ridiculous to expose a child to the world. A child becomes the center of the universe. Then these things happen. That could have been you or our child. It's happened to lots of people like you and me. Millions. Then you don't see any purpose in anything. You don't understand why a little child should be given birth to. In a few years, perhaps he will float on the ocean and be cast upon an island. And nobody knows him. And all is completely indifferent and without meaning. I don't understand it either. I wish someone would sit down next to me. Explain my life to me. Just like a teacher explains an addition. There is no explanation. I think everything is just a bunch of coincidences. - I don't believe in anything! - Yes, you do, Eva. Deep inside. I think God has abandoned us. I believe that he is dead. And everything keeps going until it suddenly stops. Come. What is it? I think it's starting now. Can I help you? We must get to the midwife. It feels like it's coming soon. Johansson! We must get Eva to the midwife! We must use the oars or we will hit the reef! I've also experienced that, but it was worse. With my wife. It was the end of the winter, it snowed. There was a layer of ice. It was worse. - And that went well? - Oh yes, very well. Where is your family now? The kids are married elsewhere. My wife died last winter. - Isn't it lonely? - Not really. I have the radio, the cow and the cat for company. How did you feel when you got your first one? I don't remember it too well. I was drunk like a pig! But I was happy, obviously. And proud. She was very beautiful, my daughter. She looked like her mother. - It's very quiet in there now. - Is it? I don't know about that. You can come in now. After you. It's your son. 3,5 kilos. Not bad. I think he's grand. He seems to have character. I think he's very grand. With his hands and everything. Can I take him? You see, Eva? When you hold a child, everything comes together. It does. About earlier today... That I wanted someone to explain life to me - simply and directly. - Yes, I remember. That somebody is him. No other explanation is necessary. - Can I show him to Johansson? - Of course. Johansson! That was a nice one. Yes, good work was done. - What's your first name? - Mikael. But I've been called Johansson for the last 50 years. Even my wife and kids. He will be named Mikael. And you will be his godfather, Johansson. And as in a white flaming second, I see life's greatness, wealth and magnitude. I see how the white, the red and the glowing wires entwine with the dark and the black in a web of peculiar beauty and power. Death is no longer a grim reaper, a shadow behind my back, but part of the life and of its waves. Infinite and untiring, like the waves of the ocean. Mikael? I will tell you about all of this one day. I know that you won't understand then. But I think that you will realise it by yourself. That you will be touched by it, carry it in your heart and visibly on your face.
