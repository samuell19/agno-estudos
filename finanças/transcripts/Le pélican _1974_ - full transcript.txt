Surname: Boyer First name: Marc Régis Jean Born on 25 April 1962 in Boulogne to Boyer Paul, musician, and Boré Isabelle, unemployed. Could you please sign? - Here it is. Thank you. - Thank you. Isabelle, the child is crying. - What will you have? - Schweppes. - Have you thought about it? - A little. I don't know... Sounds risky... There is no danger, believe me. Everything has been meticulously prepared. Be sure we'd all benefit from a success of that job. Let's say I accept.. How will I get my money? Half in New York and the rest when you return to Paris. When do you need my answer? - When do you go on tour? - In about a month and a half. Well... If I get your answer 15 days before departure, that's fine. You have some time, think again. For you, it's still a lot of money! Now, if you don't need the money... My turn! I have to go. Let's meet somewhere else. We'll be more comfortable. I may call you at home? Yes. Think again! Alright. - Would you like some coffee, Isabelle? - Yes, please. - You don't want any? - No thanks I have to go, I have a rehearsal. Are you coming for me? Yes, I'll be back around six tonight. A kiss? Bye See you tonight. - Here, Mom, it's for you rent. - No, I don't want it. - Don't make a fuss! - You already gave me some last month. - Don't worry, take it. - I'll see you Sunday for lunch? - Yes. Why did Paul leave so quickly? He had a rehearsal. - Has the kid eaten enough? - Yes, thank you. What a little treasure! He's so cute. He looks more and more like his daddy. Do you think so? You still haven't heard anything about Paul's father? None, no. He is not very interested in his grandson. He never took care of his son. So his grandson... Even when you were together, he didn't care about him? Just think! He always wanted to to put him in boarding school. How old was he when you got divorced? About ten. It was right at the end of the war. - He used to see him afterwards? - Never. Paul has been affected a lot by all of this, you know. Want to play? Did you hear that? Who is it? Mom? Come on. Should we go get Mom? - Mommy? - Yes, it's Mom. How are you? A little kiss? - Where were you? - With Catherine. She may have found me a sales position. - Where ? - In a fashion boutique, near the opera. That would be nice! I'm dead tired. We've been walking around all day. - Did you give Marc his snack? - A yogurt and some cookies. Tell me, do you know what day it is today? Friday, why? No, I mean what date? - The 15th? - Exactly. - Remind you of anything? - No. It's our second wedding anniversary. Right! I forgot. Oh you forgot! I give you a present. What do you want? A Chanel bag! A Chanel bag? Very well. A Chanel bag. What are you thinking about? This trip... I have to give my answer within 3 days. Tempting, no? Any news about your sales position? Oh you know... I changed my mind. I don't really feel like it. Working 8 hours a day in a shop for 60,000 francs a month. - Rather depressing, no? - Maybe. Do you think you're really risking anything by taking this trip? I don't know. This is dangerous. It's a lot of money too. Do we really need it? We don't live so badly. With debts everywhere. As everyone. We could pay off. And then... We'd buy a small used sports car. Convertible. We'd get a bigger apartment. For Marc, it would be better. He would have his own room. It would be more pleasant. Boyer Paul, born on 23 October 1936 in Paris 12th. You were arrested on 25 June 1964 at Kennedy Airport and sentenced to ten years by the Criminal Court of New York for complicity in a counterfeiting case. You have just been granted a one-year early release. - Where are you staying? - In a hotel. - Don't you have a permanent address? - No. This address: Mrs. Bailly, 35 rue Blomet? This was my mother's address. She passed away. - The person waiting for you next door? - My father. Please sign. - You haven't changed. - You think so? You look the same, with a few more gray hairs. How did you know I was coming today? Through your lawyer. I told him to let me know as soon as as he knew the date of your return. That's nice of you. Does it upset you that I came to get you? I'm surprised. I've thought a lot about you all these years. Is that so? What are you going to do now? See my son again. Of course. - Do you know where he lives? - Yes. You can't wait to see him again? I've been waiting nine years for this moment. I understand you, Paul. No, you can't understand me. A son has never meant much to you. I know. I know, Paul, you're mad at me. I was wrong then. I'm not trying to make excuses for myself. But now, I'd like to help. Do something for you. It's when you're a child that you need your father. So you really don't want to come home? No. Well, whatever you say. I have your car in the garage. If you want it, just give me a call. If you need anything, I'm here. Do you have any money? Yes, thank you. Think about my offer anyway. I've made up my mind. It's too late now. Thank you. Boyer, listen to me I've been letting you talk for 15 minutes I understand your feelings and, to a certain extent, I share them. But I think it is worth reminding you that there is against you a serious court decision. Now I need to see how I can get your son back. The Cazenave are powerful opponents. They have relationships. If they want, they can drag this out indefinitely. For years. So, if you're serious about this, you'll have to bring me some proofs. - Which ones? - First, some character references From well-known people, if possible who will testify that you're fit for custody of your child. And the proof that you have an appropriate housing. When we'll have all that, I'll file a motion. No problem there. I know very well the magistrate who handles these cases. - Will it take long? - I'm afraid so. We can expect a lengthy procedure. - How long will it take? - It depends... There will be investigations, social workers, etc. This is really beyond me. And then, my dear Boyer, there will be the problem of costs. From what I just told you, you may guess that this is not a small case. Do you have the means to take on such procedure? Will it be expensive? I can't tell you exactly, but for starters, I'd need a deposit of 3,000 francs. And when would you need it? My dear, I can't start anything without it. I regret having to speak about these things but it is better to do it without false modesty. You understand me, don't you? Of course. Well, I remain at your disposal. Can I ask you one last question before I go? Please. Do you think things would have happened differently if I had been here during my divorce? Frankly, I don't think so. I did everything I could for you. I hope that it is not a reproach. No, no. Thank you very much. Goodbye, Sir. Mme Cazenave, please. They are not here, Sir. They're on vacation. - For how long? - Ah, I don't know. They're on holiday in Lugano. They have a house there. - Would you have their address? - Yes, wait a minute. Villa Diamantina, Figino, Lugano. Thank you, Madam. - What floor do they live on? - The second floor. Thank you. - I'll see if Madame is available. - Thank you. I'm here to see my son. You shouldn't have come. Where is Marc? How long have you been back? It's Paul. Will you leave us alone, dear? Would you like a drink? No, thank you. So, you're back. Yes, as you can see. It wasn't too hard? It must feel good to be free after so many years. Please, sit down. You will understand that I am surprised to find you here. I'm here to see my son. Precisely. You know very well that at the time of your divorce with Isabelle, you have been stripped of your paternal rights. You don't seem to to realize it. You are here to see your son? It is impossible. Why? He never heard of you. What do you mean? When you were sentenced, he was two years old. Then his mother told him that you were gone forever. He never asked for you. What are you saying? We should have told him that his daddy was in jail in America? For 10 years? Come on, be reasonable! The past is the past. Anyway, you can't do anything, you have no rights over him. Justice is on our side. Think about it. Sure? You don't want anything to drink? Listen to me Let's try to get along. I'm speaking frankly. Here is what I suggest. You must be in a difficult material situation. I can help you. In return you give me your word that you will not seek to see your son again. Do you agree ? I do it to the bearer. It's a down payment. I'll give you another one in Paris. Bastard. Get the hell out of here right now! Did you hear? Get out! Thank you. - May I have your binoculars ? - Sure. Mademoiselle, please! Do you speak French? Do you know if it is possible to call here? There's a cafeteria on the right, maybe a mile away. Thank you very much. - Don't be afraid, be quiet - Let me go, I don't know you! - Be quiet, Marc, I'll explain! - Leave me alone! Stop! - Stop it! - Please, calm down, I'll explain. I'm afraid. Let me - Don't be afraid, I'll walk you home later - Let me go! I promise you, I'll walk you home. I'll show you something. You see this little boy? Do you recognize him? - It's me. - Yes, it's you. And the man carrying you on his shoulders. Do you recognize me? Do you? You were 2 years old. It was at the Jardin d'Acclimatation. You always wanted to go. You see, you have nothing to be afraid of. I've known you for a long time. I want to get away. We'll call your house. - You know the number? - Yes. I would like to speak to Ms. Cazenave? Mr. Cazenave? Is that so? No, no. Just tell them that Marc is with his father. I'll take him home in the morning. When you were a kid, you always wanted to take this train. Why did you say earlier earlier that you were my father? - Because it's the truth. - No, it's not the truth! Who is your father? My real father? I don't know. I don't know him. He left when I was a kid. - What is your name? - Marc. - Your last name? - Boyer. Marc Boyer. Paul Boyer. If you're my father, why did you leave when I was young. It's too hard to explain, Marc. Later, in a few years, when you're older, I'll explain. Can't you tell me right away? You wouldn't understand. Someday, I'll tell you, I promise. - Where were you? - In America. America, I would like to go there. Roger often goes there. - Who is this Roger? - He's my father-in-law. What does he do for a living? Oh, I don't know. He's always telling Mom he's buying cheap and reselling it at the highest possible price. Do you come here sometimes? I think I was here once a long time ago. - Oh! A shooting range. We go there? - If you like. One board please. - Can you even shoot? - Yes. - Really? - Yes, I know. - It's not too heavy? - Not at all. - Almost only in the red! - Good job, kid. - Do you shoot often? - Every now and then. Come on, let's go! Here, take your time. Hold your breath. Give it to me, I'll try. Ah! Totally missed! Here, you try the last one. Right in the red! Shall we go for a ride on the enchanted river? - Oh no, it's for the little ones! - No, it's not for the little ones. When you were a kid, you always wanted to go on boat rides. How old was I? Two years, two and a half years. I think we look ridiculous in this. No, why? Not at all. - When do you go back to school? - In a week. - What grade are you in? - 6th grade. - Don't you like it? - Not much... Well, throw it away. - Would you like something else? - No, thank you. - Ice cream? - No, really, thank you. Did you sleep well? - Did you sleep well? - I want to go home. Yes sure, I'll walk you home. What do you want for breakfast? Chocolate. Bread and butter? No, toasted bread and jam. Very good. I'd like a chocolate with toasted bread, and a black coffee. And some jam. Thank you. When will you take me home? In a while, as soon as we've had breakfast. Would you like to see me again? Yes, if you like. - Do you like the boat? - Oh yes, it's great! Sailing boats are better than motorboats. - Tell me, are you doing well at school? - So-so... And which subject do you prefer? History and music. Music? Yes, I am the first in the class. True? Do you play an instrument? Flute. Flute is pretty. Would you like to be a musician later on? Yes, I would like to. But they say it's not a job where you make a lot of money. But it is important to earn a lot of money? I don't know Well, then? When you have money, you can do a lot of things. You can buy anything you want. Such as ? Nice cars, houses, motorcycles... Go on safari or anything you want. Come in! Thank you. I like toasted bread. Do you like sports? I'm on the football team at school. When I was your age, I was goalie. I'm a center forward. Goalie, it's no fun, you never run. You always stay put. - Are you a fast runner? - I run the 60m in 16 seconds. - And do you like cross-country running? - I don't know, I've never done that. You want to tell me now why you left when I was a kid? It's too hard, Marc. I'll tell you later. I promise. Yes ? What is it? Police! Come in, it's open. - Are you Paul Boyer? - Yes, it's me. Come on, little guy, get dressed. I'm taking you home. You got any ID? All right, he's ready. I take the kid. I'll see you around, Marc. Would you mind? Yeah, sure. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come on, let's go. Marc! - I'd like to see Mr. Cazenave. - He's not in. - I know he's here! - I'm telling you he's not here! I want to see Mr. Cazenave! Let me through! Get out immediately! What did you tell my son? Where do you think you are? Get out! You brainwashed him! What did you say? Isabelle, call the police. You lied to him. What did you tell him? He is my son. You stole my son! - You're thieves! - You jerk. Take it easy, man. We won't hurt you. Goodbye. Thank you. Watch out, catch him! Go the other side, we'll get him.
