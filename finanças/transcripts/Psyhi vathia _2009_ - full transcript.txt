GREEK CASUALTIES ON THE BATTLEFIELD BALKAN WARS ( 1912-1913) 12.000 GRECO-TURKISH WAR (1919-1922) 37.000 GRECO-ITALIAN - GRECO- GERMAN WAR (1940-1941) 15.000 CIVIL WAR (1946-1949) 70.000 I came to Kastoria to meet you. Every hour that goes by is against our country. Mister President, you can come in. GRAMMOS 1949 We must prevent the worst, Your Majesty. The left party wants to reconcile... ...as does the government... ...and the conservative parties. The left party is mocking us. I know you are friends with its' leaders... ...but please know that they are misleading you. Our nation has been devastated for two years now. The communists are saying one thing to you... ...and acting another on the mountains. The weapon surrender agreed in Varkiza was a great fiasco. You have to admit that their fear for retaliation was verified. They were left adrift in a pogrom of violence. It is too late now, mister President. Yesterday I was in Athens... ...and the American ambassador told me... ...about president Truman's notification. He demands the collapse of this rebellion shortly. May I give you an advice? Use your constitutional rights. The history of our nation... ...and the future generations will not depend on foreigners. Mister President... ...it's up to the Americans now. WHICH DEATH DID YOU SEEK? WAS THERE ANY WIND? MARKOS MESKOS Dear Anesti. Vlasi. My boys. Long lost without a sign. For you I ask but no one speaks. A young teacher is writing this letter for me. I tell her to write. Someone must know where you are and give it to you. Tomorrow is Sunday. I will lit a candle so that you can have each other... ... as well as a loaf of bread. Anesti, keep an eye on Vlasis. He is still young. Be careful. These are hard times. Hard people. Dark minds. Your mother, Zaharoula. Guard 5! It's quiet up here, lieutenant. Kalamatianos? Yes, lieutenant? -Has the boy arrived? -Not yet. Kronos, can you read me? Kronos, I can read you. Your signal is fading. You are ready. This is lieutenant Triantafilos. Yes. It was quiet last night. They are relaxing. There is talk about 50. Of Captain Ntoulas. Give me the exact location. The map says that the hill is known as Psoriarika. Can you read me? Psoriarika! Close to Mega Plai. Mega Plai! I will try to locate it. Boy! The Lieutenant is looking for you. Come! I need supplies. I run out of supplies. On the way. Out. Over. If you're done we' re ok. You needed two hours to load? The animal got tired. Are you flirting with that rebel? Do not touch her! They even mess with the dead. In Milies four soldiers were blown up. They were sent to collect two other corpses. Come closer. Have a look at this. How are we going to flank the hill? The outlaws are here. There is no path. Only rocks on the right. Didn't you say that your father's pen was on this side? On the left. In the open. How far is it? Two hours. One till Donti and another till Elato Arkoudas. Bring water. Be back in an hour. Don't you have any other clothes? You're too young for khakis but I'll see what I can do. These are full of holes. I thought they forgot about us! No rush! No rush! They will keep shooting at Karagiozi's wedding. He is not tall. Shorter than me. He looks like a giant though. It's not his moustache nor his gray tunic... ...that makes him unique. It's his look. Peaceful and universal. It grasps you. It grasps you. It was the 1st of May in Moscow. Everyone was helping to clean the city. I helped in the school of Kremlin. He spoke in Russian. "Help me, comrade. This stud is heavy". You speak Russian? "Are you helping too, comrade? " I asked. What was his reply? "We are comrades in everything, Greek". How did he know? Vlasi, the one who defeated Hitler... ...the great Joseph Stalin is Georgian. Georgians and Greeks are like brothers. -Comrade Doulas? -What is it, Gianoula? When we are done here we should invite him over. To honour him. Yes! And I'll tell my mother to bake some cabbage pie. Yes! Soulful! Soulful! Mega Plai is over there, Lieutenant. Will you know how to bring me back? The guerrillas were here yesterday, Lieutenant. How do you know, Anestis? From their footprints, their excrement. There are flies. The tree, Lieutenant. It has been scrapped by the mules as they were passing by. Where could your brother be? I don't know. In the mountains somewhere. I just hope he is alive. Come. Adjust the lens so that you can see properly. Do you like it? You remind me of Kostis. My nephew. He is eleven. An orphan. My brother-in-law, a fierce Captain... ...was killed in Albania in 1940. What is it? Nothing, Lieutenant. 1685, Anonimo. Psoriarika, Profitis Ilias. Tsiouka Rosa, Mankovits. Our aim is to recapture the mountains. Before I move on with the HAG's estimates for the area... ...I will give to our American friend, Colonel John Lewis... ...the opportunity to pose questions. Halasmena Horafia. Four hours. Kokinorahi? Upward journey. Five hours. Katarahi. Katarahi-Profitis Ilias. Eight hours. Risky. No cover. Only at night. Mega Plai? Barren. Enough. Leave. You have a long trip ahead of you. Hold on. -How old are you? -Seventeen. Your father? He stepped on a mine. He got killed. Your mother? My mother and the rest of the villagers were captured by the army. It's been a while. I don't know where they are. Is it true that your brother is fighting with the enemy? They took him eight months ago. While he was feeding the herd. How old is he? Fourteen. Very well. Remember your land's trees, Anestis. My boys. I am bitter and alone. Days full of poison. And they won 't even let me find you. Go to your uncle Prikos. He knows the ground. He knows every ravine, every cave. He will give you food. It's starting to rain. Control, this is Ermis. Can you reach me? Captain Ntoulas. Corpses. Fire. Over. Keep us posted. Over. Make them remember you. Dead or alive. Monarch-Fascists on the move. This is Captain Doulas' territory. Awaiting Orders. Over. Do I keep contact with the shooters? Over. We don't feed you to die. We feed you to fight. May God be with you. Let's go. Get them! Beware! You are walking through a minefield. Soulful! To our victory! The Democratic Army supports you. Over. Keep your head down, Vlasis. Down! Spartan, stay in the corner. Kalamatiane, on the saddle! Antonis. Miltos. On the pit. You come with me. Let's go. Keep down! Kalamatiane, in the middle! Bullseye! Get them, Svouras! Grammos will not fall! I got you, motherfucker! See you in heaven! Shoot them, Spiros! Every bullet counts! Can you handle it? I have them. Get ready, Agele. I'll cover you. Behind me, Anestis. Anestis, next to me. Here. The machine guns sing for Grammos to dance. Grammos is ours! Keep your heads down. Be careful, guys. Down, Foula. Froso, call Artemis, quickly. Cover for us, Kalamatiane. Be careful. This is for Kalamata! Aim at their caldrons! Ok, Captain. Zeus to Saturn, do you reach me? Emergency call. Ready? I have casualties. I have casualties. We are being attacked. The pill boxes are still intact. I have casualties. Dead in front of Frederica. Awaiting orders. We should end this. Agele! Stay back, Anestis. I will kill them. One bullet, one head. Keep your head down, boy. Scum, Doulas! Tonight I want Triantafillos. You will have him. Done. Keep down. I'll cover you. Kosmas, once Gianoula recharges you attack. Keep your head down, Vlasi! Triantafile, are you alive? You won't be happy tomorrow, Gianoula. Come. I'm waiting. Leonidas, keep the wad upwards. Salonikie, cover for them. Let's go. Come on, my little soldier. This is Soulful. Defense successful. Do you read me? We have casualties. We will count them. The hill is and will remain free. Over. Brigadier. I was informed about your request. It is forbidden. The child. I want the child, Brigadier. As a Greek and a father I understand but I follow orders. Where is he now? I want him back. He was an orphan. I raised him. I gave him to the country. I have informed the headquarters. There's nothing I can do now. I won't leave without the child. My only grandchild. They will be honored in Kastoria. He'll have another 20 with him. Who cares about the honors? He died with dignity. What dignity? This is not a war, Brigadier. This is a disgrace. Greeks fighting each other. I want to bury him in the village. Everyone is waiting for him. I won't go back alone. My house is empty. I want to have a tomb to visit. I have no way of sending him. I have. My wagon is outside. Captain. Don't send James away. Kolias Sirogianis. Here. Fellow soldiers. This is the honored Democratic Army. Grab your rifles and come with us. They may shoot. Leave her to me. Frederica sent you to die... ...for the palace's shake. Fellow soldiers, there is nothing wrong between us. We are both poor. Gianoula is that you? Yes. They say you have red hair. Is your pubic hair red as well? Is that you, Fascist Triantafile? Yes. I can smell the piss of your cowards all the way from here. You shit your pants once more! You whore! I will catch you alive. I will make you a washer for the National Army. I wiped out many of your men. Dream on. Till I kill you as well. Way to go, Gianoula. Enough with this talk, Fascists. Good luck tomorrow. Vlasis, are you sure this is Kroki? I'm sure. Drepano is behind that mountain. It's my village. Thomas, go to the tree. Let's go, guys. Keep quiet. The fascists may be in the first villages. Foula. Throw it in the river. To the Revolution! Everybody shout out loud! Stand on your feet. With new, iron fists. Winds are blowing all around us. Dark beasts are looking for us. Spiros! This is the battle that we have to give. But nobody knows what the future will bring. But with our flag held high... ...full of pride and full of faith... Come on! We fall yet we win in the fight against slavery. Soulful! I can't hear you. Comrade Aitos! Hermes to Control. Comrade Aitos has brought supplies. Over. Guerrillas, keep strong. Comrade Aite, welcome. I fooled them. I sent a mule loaded with trousseau and a female comrade as a bride. Hurry. They have to go. Comrades! No bullet should go to waste! Yes, Captain. They are precious. Make the most of them. Captain, you should meet our youngest. He is 14 but he finds paths even at night and in the woods. In my village we say "little devil big heart". He is a shooter as well. A shooter! I will inform the headquarters that our young are greater than us. -What is your name, Comrade? -Vlasis, Captain. From now on your name will be Comrade Flogas. Comrade Flogas. Stupid boy. The next time Gianoula sees your smoke she will kill you. Turn your back. Can you imagine Gianoula and Kalamatianos meeting... ...in a fair after the war and dancing together? Protect yourselves. Is Athens big, Lieutenant? You've never been there? I've never left my village. Miriki Evritanias. I will go someday. To watch football. AEK! When I leave the army I will go to the capital. To see it. Then I will become a chef in a huge hotel. Hasn't anyone visited Athens before? I have. Did you visit the Parthenon? I spent two days inside a brothel, Lieutenant! Don't throw any more woods. When are we going home? Have they told you? Tell them that we are tired, Lieutenant. Twelve months on the mountains. Eighteen months. Tomorrow we'll wake up at five. My boys. I dreamt of our yard. The flowers, the chicken, the cat. Full of life. Like a song. Vlasis, my little lamp. If you pass by our place light the fireplace. I don 't want our chimney to go dry. Listen to Anestis. Your mother Zaharoula. Are you alone? Sit. Our house is a wreck. Poor mother. What are you eating? Bread. Dry. For the past three days. Lick the olives. That way they last longer. The Captain sent me to gather some snails. Look. Take some salt. Keep it and eat it by yourself. Take some grass too. For the fleas. I load machine guns now. The guy who did it before me died. Is Ntoulas with you? He mumbles to himself. He saves one bullet for himself. Are you scared? I was when I heard the gun. Gianoula couldn't stop laughing. Vlasis, when you get scared twitter. I will hear you. My name is Comrade Flogas now. Time to go. On the fir next to Mega Plai you will find bread if you are hungry. In three days, at night, I will twitter so that you can hear me. Uncle? Vlasis, how are you? Don't cry, uncle. I lost you. You left. I am ok. So is Anestis. I saw him a while ago. Is he with you? He is with the others. They take care of him. Our mother? In Vogatsiko. Captured like the rest of the villages. 300 people. Our herds are gone. Half of them by the army and less by your folks. They gave me a piece of paper. They say they will pay for them. What's left of the herd got scared. No milk whatsoever. Don't cry. You'll do it again. I will come with Anestis in the winter. Wake up! Grab your guns! Come on. Shoot! Come, Alexis. Hurry. Zeus to Saturn, do you read me? Soulful! Come on! Emergency call! Keep down. I need backup. Come on, Panagiotis. Do you read me? I need backup immediately. Hold on, Panagiotis. Stay on the radio, Nikos. Let's go, guys. May God be with us. Vlasis, be careful. Don't pity them! Destroy them! They killed Panagiotis, Antonis and Miltos. Soulful! Destroy them and I will bring you all the whores you want! Careful! Fuck them! Morfoula? We went to school together. We sat on the same desk. What if I killed her? Saturn to Zeus. Do you read me? Ntoulas is retreating immediately. We are counting our dead and wounded. This is Lieutenant Triantafilos. We successfully defended ourselves against Ntoulas' attack. There are casualties on both sides. Over. Come. Who is it? Come. Hurry. Bring me those who have excrement in their mouth. Nikos. Slaughter! Saturn to Pythagoras. There has been a slaughter. My suit... ...my wedding suit. It's ready. Since Easter. Stavroula... It's ready. In Preveza. 18 Agiou Nikolaou street. I owe 40 drachmas. Comrade Vaso. You do it. You've earned it. Drosos Alogaris, 19 years old. Maritsa Gazi, 17. Artemis Galonis, 19. Leonidas Ntanos, 19. Panais Tsetsonis, 20. Kipriani Savva, 21. My sister. If my brother gets hurt I will kill myself. When things calm down I will take you back to your mother. I will tell her about the day that you came to us. Amidst the snow, in Grammos. An angel appeared suddenly in front of us. Write something beautiful to their parents. Honestly. They were just kids. The letters are ready. I don't know how we will send them though. Something is wrong. Tell me, Comrade. Our spirits are high. Everyone loves ideas. But? But lately I've been asked. "Where are the Soviets? " When will they support us? Should we wait for them? There are many paths to the Kremlin. It's Gianoula, Captain. She freaked out. Where is she? She was gazing at the river. She freaked out. She is shaking. Grinding her teeth. He was crying in my dream. I woke up and looked for him. I wanted to nurse him. He won't come back. Gianoula. My breasts are heavy. Full of milk. He died hungry. Drink some water. Do it. Do it. This is because you smashed my baby's head. Exactly one year ago. Floga, if the gun kicks it will throw you down. Hurry. The food is great today. We ate your meat. You should bring some more. What was your job before? A seamstress. And you'll be a comrade for ever? When we go back I'll be a seamstress again. Have you ever seen an American? Once. In the movies. They are tall with big hats and a gun in their hand. Have you ever seen a movie? No. It's a big ribbon on the wall of a cafl. That's where they show them. Hurry because you'll sleep hungry. This is where you were baptised. And this is where Sergiani married that rich American. These are chocolates that the Americans sent. The Lieutenant said we should share one. The cook gave me his. I saved it for you. If only we were together. If only I could look after you. I have my own machine gun. Have you killed anyone? Two enemies. Come with us. You'll have a machine gun too. The Captain says that we will win. Sometimes I want to run away. Far away. On my own. But what if they shoot our mother? Next time we meet elsewhere. In the Pit of Zavos? They don't know it. They do. In Mouhliasmena? Careful. In Pithikouki there are traps. Go to Asprohoma and then Likotripa. Then go to Pente Alonia and Vouno-Karavi. Go first. I can't locate the enemy. Cease fire. Our target is exact. The enemy is silent. I will try to locate them. Keep your radio open. Be careful where you step on. Do not move the dead. They may be trapped. Lieutenant. Saturn to Zeus, do you read me? Ntoulas' unit has been destroyed. 60 cannons have been abandoned. Cartridges, weapons. Where were you last night? I visited my father's grave. Today is All Souls Day. This is for your own good. This is not a game. This is war. I recognised the animal from the crack. It's faithful. I had it with me. You are young. The Captain will send me. Now I know your signal. You are late. We changed positions. We moved further. I know. This is for the doctoress. Eleni. Argiro, they brought medicine. The doctoress will leave shortly. This is where she was hit yesterday. She was carrying water. I dragged her in with no feet. Go now. I can manage. Keep strong. We know what we'll do once it all goes wrong. Give the machine gun to someone else. Change every 30 minutes. We have to move fast. My father says that we should laugh when we travel upwards. On the way down there are many slides. Is this the right way? We just passed through Afhenas. And then? Then the path leads to Anonimos. A three hour journey. Then we will meet Plagia and Dokano. By the time we approach the village it will be dark. If you trap us I will shoot you. I swear. On my mother. Come on. Koula? He is frozen. It's quiet. The weapons are frozen. Give him something. General van Fleet, with all due respect I disagree. Exactly. In 2 months, 7. 146 dead, wounded and missing soldiers... ...in hand to hand battles mostly. These are frontline casualties. General van Fleet, no military operation against the outlaws... ...was carried out without the advice of American specialists. 5.000 Americans that you chose. Young people. Young people who stood out in the battlefield. Prosopiki, fighter. Fotinos, contact. Fterotos, mailman. Nefeli, nurse. Astrapi, saboteur. Ligeros, builder. Pitsirika, baker. Kastoriani, shooter. Foula, fighter. Flogas, shooter. GRAMMOS I lost track of them because they separated us. Margaro, Theodora and me. We left the village together. Secretly. At night. Which village? Far away. Further than Xanthi. I've been working on tobacco warehouses since I was nine. I don't smoke though and I'm 15. Are you in love? I was. With a fighter? A girl in the village. You don't love her anymore? I won't tell you. What about you... are you in love? I don't know. What I want most is to shoot a plane down with my gun. I will do it for Gianoula. Have you seen these planes before? No. What if they're ours? The Soviets? Isn't that where our people are? Do you think they made it? We better move separately. Follow the river just in case you find anything. I'll go to Dasinaraki to see if they ended up in Strouges. If you miss me wait for me in Ntostimorema. You know it. I will signal like a frog when I arrive. Vlasis, why haven't you signalled? I didn't know if you were alive! I though you got burned. Killed. I was in a celebration. The Americans are burning the hills. Didn't you see? I saw. Do you know where they burnt? -They will burn everything. -We will kick them out! -You are coming with me. -Do not order me around. I'll return to my people. The fire must have sent them away. I have to find them. I won't let you. Anesti, I am a hero of the Democratic Army. Once we win I will show it to everyone. To our mother. Vlasi! I am not afraid of anything. Time to go, Comrades. How are we going to tell them that the Russians won't help? We are alone, Comrade. Alone. In the mountains. And the borders are closed. We move on alone. Completely alone. Come what may. How can we draw back? Where? To what life can we go back to after all this? There's one here. Don't move. Stay down! Stay down! Anesti! Anesti! My boys. I am well. I hope you are too. Now I sell things at the lake. Many soldiers, good post. I want to make some money to prepare the herd once this is over. I look at the birds. I stand beside them... ... and wait for you to fly back to me. Such beauty is wasted. Narrow minds. What a pity. Do you know Vlasis? Anestis Tsiaras? I'm their mother. Do you know them? Vlasis is the youngest. Anestis the oldest. Anestis must be a young man by now. Anestis is fine. Where did you see him? In the mountains. And Vlasis? Is he with him? It's a war. They are everywhere. He'll be close to him. He always kept an eye on him. Hurry. We have to go. Still loading? Hurry! Get it over with. Fasten it tight. When you finish go to the battalion. They are bringing your brother with another four of Ntoulas' men. Tell him to say he was forced. That way he may live. You'll find us in Tapsaki. I'll speak to the Major about you. The machine gun should be loose. -Did they bring them? -They are waiting, Lieutenant. Three steps forward, everyone! Uncover them. I demand that you recognise them. Well? Tell me their names. Stranger. I don't know him. Stranger. I don't know them. I don't know them. Show me your faces. Tell me their names. Names! Stranger. Stranger. Names. I don't know him. He's a stranger. Brigadier, I sent you a message this morning. Go on, Major. Lieutenant, your medal is not shining anymore. This year you've done many wrongs. Don't insist. But he is only 14. His older brother is with us for two years now. He helps me. You know him. He is the one that guides us through the hills. Trustworthy. My hands are tied. My two boys are fighting in the frontline. 19 and 20 years old. The soldiers are the most unlucky ones. No one chose to fight Greeks on Greek mountains. Their service couldn't have taken place at a worst time. You chose not to participate. My mission is one. To protect the Nation. To provide the country with pure Greeks. I asked for your forgiveness... ...but you refused to abide by the national ideals. I know that you are making fun of me, calling me Quinine. But when this war is over my conscience will be clean. Hellas is giving you one more chance. Repent. All rise. Death to all. Mitilinie, tell me. What is the sea like? I've never seen the sea. Can you hear me? I've never been on a ship. Vlasis Tsiaras. Who is it? Vlasis Tsiaras. Come with me. Comrade, don't do anything stupid. In 15 days I'm out of here. They did us a favour on behalf of the Lieutenant. Our mother? They are looking for her. Tell her to come and get me. To bury me next to our father. I'm scared on my own. Order arms! Positions. Get ready. Aim. Fire. Who is it? Stop or I shoot. Stop! Did he say anything? Nothing, Lieutenant. Not even his name. Then why did he come here? He seems crazy. Did you search him? Yes. We found a bullet in his pocket. Go to eat. Stand up. Stand up, I said. Tell me everything. I didn't hear you. Halasmena Horafia. Is that what you said? How many are there? 50? 80? How many? All dead. All dead? Are you Ntoulas? Ntoulas. Lieutenant Triantafilos Raptis. You were fighting against me in Mega Plai. This is the end, brother. Anesti, I heard you are ok. That made me feel better. Find Vlasis. It's time we got together now. Here there 's been chaos. They said walls collapsed in nearby places. Woods were on fire. The teacher said that some bastards made money out of this. And many died in vain. The worst is coming to an end. Thank God because you only lose your head once. Your mother, Zaharoula. Don 't be afraid. It's over. Did we win? THINK. HOW LONG DOES EVIL LAST? HOW LONG DO MIRACLES? MARKOS MESKOS
