I said get up, you lazy mongrel! We've got a talent contest to win. Jeez, I was having the best dream of my life, and you had to ruin the whole blasted thing. Julie! What's wrong with you? She's mad, like you. Doesn't mean she has to suck my flaming face off. I don't see how you're going to win any contest if I'm not there. I told you, you can't come. You're not old enough. They won't let you in. They wouldn't know how old I was unless you told them! Julie, you're not going! That's the end of it. Hurry up, Dad. I need some hot water for the shower. Well, you should have got up half an hour earlier, then. We haven't got half an hour. We're gonna miss the flamin' bus. - Yeah, yeah. - Glorious day, Julie. Oh, rack off, goat-face. Good job.

Well, thank you for turning up. Oh, you are welcome, sweet tits. You're on your last warning, boyo. Oh, blow it out your flabby arse. Uh, hello. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome. My name is Dave Lovelace, and as you can probably tell from my accent, I am from Melbourne. Pause for laughter. You're getting the idea. I kind of start off slow, and then I slowly peter out. Alright, let's get going here. First up, we've got Noelene. Where are you, Noelene, you skinny-arsed... Oh, too kind. That's your music, is it, love? Oh. Noelene is going to play one of my personal favourites, a song made famous by the Seekers. It's called 'Morning-town Ride'. She's got her own guitar, so I'm just going to leave her to it. And I'll be over here... ..opening a vein. ♪ Train whistle blowing makes a sleepy noise ♪ Underneath their blankets go all the girls and boys ♪ Rocking, rolling, riding out along the bay ♪ All bound for Morningtown many miles away... ♪ Put that away, you halfwit!

I have to say, I think you've got a long career ahead of you. Ironically, in cleaning. OK, last up. Hello - we've got a couple of sisters who tell me that they're from down the road a bit, in a place called Crommer-er-unge. Crommer-arra-runge. Commer-ah-range-er-ah. G'day, folks. Thanks for the heartfelt applause. You can find something else to do, we don't need you. I'm Gail. This is Cynthia. And, uh... just so as you know, you're all standing on blackfella country. We're the Cummeragunja Songbirds. Here's a Merle Haggard tune. Hope to God you like it. ♪ Today, I started loving you again ♪ And I'm right back ♪ Where I've really always been ♪ I got over you just long enough ♪ To let my heartache mend ♪ And then today I started loving you again ♪ What a fool I was to think I could get by ♪ With only these few million tears I've cried ♪ I should have known ♪ The worst was yet to come ♪ And that crying time for me ♪ Had just begun ♪ Well, today, I started loving you again ♪ And I'm right back where I've really always been ♪ I got over you just long enough ♪ To let my heartache mend ♪ And today, I started loving you again ♪ Yes, and today, I ♪ I started loving you ♪ Again. ♪ I thought I told you to stay home. Who are you to tell me what to do, you hard-headed drongo? I'm the one who's going to drag your big lip over your fat head in a minute! Stop it! Excuse me, mate! - We're in the middle of something. - I just wanted... That wasn't terrible. Do you sing anything other than that kind of country and western shite? Sorry, what's wrong with country and western, mate? OK. Alright, folks. We got a winner for youse. Taking home the 10 bucks - you won it, bud... it's Noelene, with 'Morningtown Ride'. - But I was great! - We were the best. That's bullshit, Merle. That's a sack of dick. You're giving it to Noelene? She's allergic to music. That's a fix. Fix, fix, fix, fix, fix... Show's over, girls. Pack your swags and get back to the humpy. You were marvellous. Hey, hey, Tammy Wynette. Did you forget something? Thanks. And we can get ourselves thrown out of a pub. Don't need your help. Thought I told you Abos to get off my premises. Oh, you were happy enough to have us sing in your crappy contest. - Who said I was happy? - What's the story anyhow? - She your relative or something? - She's ugly enough. And you can piss off out of it too. You were a shithouse MC anyhow! Better than you deserve. And a lot better than you pay. Oh, I can find somebody else. Alright, let's not do anything hasty. Come on. Remember? I'm the man who made you feel like a girl of 50 again. Are you gonna make me fetch my rifle? Hey, where are you going? I've got something to show you. Oi! Read this, will you? Will you just leave me alone? I think you've caused me enough trouble today. - I don't know how to read. - Julie, what are you doing? "Singers and dancers wanted" "to perform for the American troops in Vietnam."." And it says there's good conditions too. - I thought you didn't know how to read. - Where'd you get this? Of course I know how to read, goat-face. - Then why are you showing me that? - You need a job, don't you? We're offering you one. Playing for us in Vietnam. Yeah, OK. Where's Vietnam? Hey, Julie, the only place you're going is home on the bus. You want to go perform in Vietnam? What are you going to do? A corroboree? Why not? We're the best girl group you'll ever see. You're the best Aboriginal girl group I've ever... you're the only Aboriginal girl group I've ever seen. But trust me, girls, singing in Vietnam? It's not for you. Who are you to say what we can and can't do? You're right, I'm sorry. The years have been unkind. I'm sure you'll do much better. Good luck. Comora... comoral... Good luck, ladies. No petrol, eh? Hey, this is alright! 30 bucks a week. OK. Let's... Just for fun, let's say that you do go to Vietnam. What would you sing? Because this may have escaped your notice, but you're black. And you're singing country and western music. It's just wrong. Well, what do you think we should sing? 90% of all recorded music is shite. The other 10% is soul. Soul music. Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, that kind of stuff. - We don't sing that type of stuff. - We like Charley Pride. No, not country. Soul! Not... Just... boom, boom, boom! ♪ Give me some of that sweet soul music! ♪ Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the Godfather of Soul, Mr James Brown! That kind of thing. If you want to perform for the brothers in Vietnam, you've got to give them soul. What would this duppy white fella know about soul music? I might be a little pale on the outside, but my blood runs Negro, woman. What, the bits that don't have whisky in them? I'm not the one up there playing songs about cowboys. I like cowboys. From what I saw, you could barely play at all. Give me the number. You'd better hold your ears, because you're about to see this Black Panther roar. ♪ I was brought up on a side street ♪ I learned how to love... ♪ He's a bit silly in the head, I reckon, eh? ♪ I was educated from good stock - ♪ When I start loving... ♪ - Yeah, no, that sounds good. ♪ Oh, I can't stop ♪ I'm a soul man ♪ I'm a soul man When Dave Lovelace calls, people listen. And this 'duppy' just got us an audition next week in Melbourne. Us? Without me, there's no you. You're gonna to have to talk to Mum, now, eh? Happy to talk to Mum. Alright. Let's go steal some petrol. ♪ I'm talking about ♪ A soul man ♪ I'm a soul man ♪ Soul man ♪ Soul man... ♪ Don't you fellas ever read the newspapers? Vietnam? There's a war in Vietnam! It's true. They're having some problems over there at the minute, but I'd imagine that the girls would be miles away from any of the fighting. And there'd be armed guards, of course. Marines whose sole task it would be to watch over the girls. And who's watching over the Marines? - Mum, just listen to him. He's got us an audition in Melbourne. - Well, who is he? I don't know him! - He works at the pub in town. - Not any more. - Julie's right. I have managed to secure the girls an audition in Melbourne. When someone with my musical pedigree calls and says, "Hey, Lovelace here."". "Hey, Dave, how's it going?" "Good." You know, we small talk 'cause we're comfortable with each other. But then I say, "Hey, I've got a group." "Bring them down, Dave. We want to see 'em." You're gonna manage them, are ya? And mould them. And shape them. What about our jobs? Our jobs are gammin. OK, Gail, the two things to remember here... there's the money... and there's the Soul Man. Nah. No way. If you think I'm gonna let you girls gallivant around Melbourne, up to no good... Mum. Maybe he's right. Maybe this is the chance of a lifetime. What's wrong with your life now? Being treated like dogs by the gubs in town every single day. That's not the life I was born for. - I'm destined for fame. - We can stay at Uncle Ed's. Move over, Aretha. Stand back, Wilson Pickett. Pack your bags, Supremes, because there are some new cats in town. And those cats go by the name of the Crunjuaberry Currants. The Cunner... Cummarendens. The... We're going to have to think about your name. Get up, you moron. Mum. I suppose Gail and Cynthia can go. But Julie stays here. She's too young. That's stupid! Everyone knows they're nothing without me. - Julie, that's enough now. - You've got a child. And you're no more than a child yourself. I know I've got a child. That's why I want to make something of myself. - Get out of my face, four eyes. - Hold on, hold on. Julie's the key. Julie's the one with the voice. - Yeah, I am. - You are not. You should ask Kay. Who's Kay? Kay's their cousin. She lives down in Melbourne somewhere, but I wouldn't know where. I do. What? Since when? Long enough. Kay and them girls used to sing together once upon a time. Time that girl came back to us, anyway. Dave? Step into my office, will you? Go on, then. Yep. So, Mr Soul Man... you reckon you're the real thing, do you? Probably not. Your daughters are the real thing, though. You a murderer? No, sir. I was an entertainments officer on a cruise ship. Not any more, though. No. I had some problems. You know... you can always tell where a fish has been by cutting open its guts. But you've gotta have the right knife for it. Always like to keep my blade really sharp. I will lay down my life before I let any harm befall those girls. You'd better. Don't worry about Julie. She's a prize catch, eh? Isn't she, though? And, ladies, this design fits... stacks beautifully in the fridge or the pantry. - Coffee, anyone? - Yes, please. It makes great lunch-boxes and things like that. Come on. Kay? Are you in there? Howdy! Gail. Cynthia. You should have let me know. What do you want? If it's money, I can't. Kay? Are you alright? Uh, won't be a moment. Are we coming in, or what? It's not really convenient at the moment. I've guests. Yeah. We make you shame, do we? Jeez, you haven't changed one bit, have you? Still talking like some upper-class gub and we're your personal slaves. I don't know what you mean. Gubba. It means 'white person'. - I think you'd better go. - Kay? Can I help you? No. - Kay, do you know these people? - I'll handle this. Kay, we're going to Haysia. - What? - Where? Haysia! - Thailand. - Vietnam, you twit. Oh, Vietnam, then. Well, don't get lost. We need you, cuz. We're going to be doing shows for the soldiers in Thai... Vietnam. Singing... But it's gotta be all three of us. You're wasting your breath. She's lost, that one. Act your age, not your colour. Oh, jeez! I don't know you two! Youse mob better punch on or something, but sort it out, whatever it is, 'cause this is my big break! Cynthia! Your friend's screeching for you. Kay? We're staying at uncle Ed's, Kay. Is everything alright? Welcome, welcome all. - Uncle! - Come on, then. Here you are.

Just in the bottom there, and then you've got little ventilating holes. Gail! Gail, it's your mum! I'm... oh, I'm quite... Oh, here she is. Here she is. Mum? What's wrong? That flamin' Julie's run off somewhere. What? Mum! What? What's up? - Don't you "What up" me. - Mum? What did you say? You've let Julie run off to Melbourne, haven't you? Oh, stop your rot. I taught her well. Mum? Will someone talk to me!? Your dad and Nan helped Julie escape. Where's that James Brown fella? - Gail? - Hey. Where is he? Gail? You never told me that your uncle was Irish. - Gail! - We try to hide that. - Hello? - I'll get it. Julie! Hey, sis! What's she doing here? I'm here to sing. Dad and Nan said I could come. Did they, now? They didn't tell me. What do you want? I'm coming to Vietnam. Who says we want you? Right - if you say no Julie and you say no Kay, then there's no Cynthia. And if there's no Cynthia, there's no show.

This time, uh, Julie, can you sing the lead, please? What? No, no, no. I'm Gail. - That's right. - Yeah, my name's Gail. I sing lead. Julie and the girls do back-ups. How do you feel about not singing lead? How do you feel about getting knocked out by a woman? Pretty embarrassed, I would imagine. The thing is, Gail, I pick the songs and I pick who sings them. Nobody tells me or my sisters what to sing or who sings lead. Your voice isn't good enough to sing lead. You want to say that again? Not really. No. Gail, you are a commanding presence, on stage as you are in life. But you also have the weakest voice out of the four of you. He's right, Gail. You can hold a tune but you can't hold your own in a solo. Sometimes. More than sometimes. Anyone else? Cynthia? Maybe you should just let those of us who can do it, do it. Yeah, OK, then. - Gail, that's very... - Shut up. I'm not finished. I'm finished. Alright. Before we go again... girls, when I met you, you were doing your whole country and western thing and that's fine - we all make mistakes. But here's where we learn from that mistake. Country and western music is about loss. Soul music is also about loss. But the difference is, in country and western music, they've lost, they've given up and they're just at home whining about it. In soul music, they're struggling to get it back and they haven't given up, so every note that passes through your lips should have the tone of a woman who's grasping and fighting and desperate to retrieve what's been taken from her.

Plenty to see. - Ladies. - Plenty. It goes without saying, reports on the Sapphires have been excellent. And I've got to tell you, I'm really looking forward to seeing you sweethearts showcase your talent on stage tonight. Tonight? Well, listen up, honey. I got 32 acts. Five of them are soul sisters. If you can't shake your money maker for the brothers tonight, you're all on the first plane back to Austria tomorrow. Australia. The first plane. Fear not, brother Myron. I know my girls can lay it down. And, sister, the singing - it ain't the half of it. The show - it better be right on. If the pool's gonna be on the roof, it's gonna be up this way. Are you sure we're allowed up here? Isn't it just for the soldiers? Yes, Julie. I can smell where the good-looking men are from a mile away. You're over Jimmy Middleton now? Don't mention his name. He's had his go. He's not getting a second serve of this coffee-coloured Koori. He's in Cummeragunja, I'm in Saigon. I can do what I like. Kay! Need ya! Kay! Sorry. We're looking for the pool. You'll find the pool thataways. OK. I work in a hospital. Kay! Gail? Can I have a word? Ah, yeah, we're going to need to smarten up. I've never seen so many black men in the one place.

You've been singing with them right there, sister. Look, I'm leaving this up to you, white boy. Don't screw this up on me. I don't screw up, Myron. Just go get the dresses.

I can hear you. Where's Julie? She went that way. There you are. What are you doing out here? I need to know where you are at all times. I didn't know it was going to be like this. Anyone could lob a hand grenade and start shooting at us. There you are. What did I tell you? You shouldn't even be here. Shouting at me isn't gonna help. Yeah, well, it's your stupid idea in the first place, isn't it? Julie, darling. Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Can you not stick your nose in it? Jesus Christ. Look, Gail, if I could think of a way to insult a black woman without coming across as racist... Well, if you can't, it probably means you are. Will you just shut up? Look, you know what? That's it. We're going to have this out, you and me. Come on, bud. Let's go. Fine. Here and now. This shit - this has to stop. You're going to have to start giving me the respect that I deserve. Respect? What are you, the flaming mission manager? Yes! I'm the manager. I am the man who's going to manage you better than you've ever been managed! It would take a special man to manage me properly.

Going out with a black fella's not gonna make you any blacker, Kay. Oh, well. You never know. You think you can walk away from your mob? Live in the city for 10 years making out you're a gubba and then get up on stage and say you're a black fella and that's alright? Nah. It's not alright, not with me. Don't start me, Gail. I'm not going to do this now. Oh, this poor little mission gin is making the coconut shame, eh? What did you call me? Coconut? Oh, sorry. Have I offended ya? Don't go telling me what I am and what I'm not. I didn't get a say in how things worked out for me. So you're black now, or you're white? You're black now you think there's money in it. I know what I am. Yeah, but does Robby? Gail? Gail? What was that about? Kay's mum. It's her birthday. So we're doing a show for her... and we're on top of a truck. Two black cars pull in. Government fellas. Run! Go, go! - Come on, now! - Get the kids away! Mum and Dad screaming at us. "Kids, get across the river!" I don't get it. What did they want? The children. It's my responsibility, Dave, to look after the little ones because I'm the oldest. Hurry up! I'm not to let them out of my sight, especially not Kay. Why Kay? If you're fair like Kay, them fellas reckon she could pass for white. - Get out of the way! - Leave them kids alone! Take her from her family, put her in an institution, teach her white ways. Pretty soon, there'll be no black fellas left to worry about. Kay. And then, um, Kay got sick. I mean real sick. We're scared it's pneumonia so we take her to town, to hospital... and... and that's when we find out them government fellas have been back. Where's Kay? They've taken Kay from the hospital bed. You've got to speak to me! Say something to me! Where's my baby little girl? Where's Kay gone? Kay! Where are you, baby girl? - Speak to me! - "Kay." Say something to me! "Where are you, Kay?" No, I won't stop! "Where's my girl?" Where's Kay gone?! You know, we didn't see Kay till her mum died. They let her come home for the funeral. And all she could say in all that time... If you people worked as much as you fished, you'd be really rich, you know? And I've never been able to forgive her, or myself. We should dance. What? It's a good time to dance. Nuh. Come on. I'll show you how to shake your moom. Yeah-no, I've seen you shake your moom. It's not pretty. I'm gonna teach you the Lovelace Lanky Leg Shuffle. No. If I start dancing like you, the brothers there might think I'm a gubba. Oh, I see. You're saying because I'm white, I can't dance. Is that it? - Yep. - Well, that's just racist. You're a racist. You should know better. Come on. Just watch and learn. Don't be afraid. It's all about the shoulders. They don't belong to me, they belong to the music in my head. - Nuh. - Deadly. When we use that word, 'deadly', it usually means something's good. You know, Gail, there's a funny thing about you. Everybody thinks that you're just this... this mouth on legs... this defensive, argumentative old witch. Stick with me. There's a reason that you're this... terrible mouth, and it's very simple. You're mama bear... and they're your little baby cubs. You been drinking? No. Come on, then, you silver-tongued wannabe. I'll dance with ya. Let me lead. For once.

On our own? - Not if I had my way, ma'am. - How do we get to our next gig? I... Sorry, ma'am. I thought you knew. The military's approved the use of a vehicle for you. In that? What about the band? Ma'am, I understand your band is being pulled out also. Dave? Myron, hi. Listen, it's Dave. What's happening, bro? They've taken away our military escort and our backing band. I can't accept that. Dave, we've already talked about this. Wait. When? Last week on the phone. Don't screw this up on me! Do you hear me? Now, a colleague of mine, Lou McGary, is touring from the States. Some big names. He wants to hear Julie sing. Man, I think we got us a star in the making here. - What's so special about Julie? - Shh! You need to get yourselves to Nha Trang. I'm gonna get Lou on a military flight. We got to get Julie in front of this guy. Myron, explain to me how we're gonna gig without Hendo and the band. - Where's Hendo and the band? - Shh! Man, forget about them, man. They're out of the picture. We got a 10-piece in Nha Trang that's nothing but class, baby. No, wait, wait... Myron, wait. If you want the breaks, you gotta make 'em, man. And then you gotta take 'em, baby! Julie could put us on the map, stateside. You dig what I'm saying? Now, you want to stand in the way of success? Then you go right ahead. No, Myron... Myron? My...? - You don't remember, do ya? - I do. I... It's coming back to me. He said, uh... something about, you know, Nha Trang and, um... What? How smashed were you when you let Myron talk you into this? I'm sorry. Yeah. Sure. Sir, you might find a use for this. You'd better give that to me. Bye, ladies. Good luck! Oh, truly, Cyn. I can't see how he's a great loss. All Hendo did was feed you booze and drugs and take advantage of ya. Gail, there isn't a soldier in Vietnam who isn't stoned out of his brain all the time. Yeah, well, don't forget he had a wife. - How do you know? - Cyn, there's always a wife. Not always. Dave, you're not married, are you? What? - Are you married? - What? "What?" Are you married? No. Yes. Oh, holy mother of God. - Shit. - Alright. They want us to get out. - Do you want the gun? - Shit, no. No. OK, nice and easy. Alright. We're not soldiers. Entertainers. Come on.

This is the guy I want you to meet. His name is Lou McGary, OK? Hey, Lou. This is Julie McCrae. Lou-Lou, miss. I have heard so much about you. She's got some pipes on her, Lou. - Wait till you hear this girl. - I bet she does.

No more. What the heck was that all about? She's right. You're making us look like crap. What's your problem? They love me out there. Maybe you should just pull it back a bit. Now let's get back on stage. Nuh. Not with her. You've been drinking, Cyn, and there's too much at stake tonight. What are you doing? Sacking me? - Dave? - I'll decide. I think we should all decide. Cyn, we're doing it without ya. Right? Decision made. Gail. I'll make you proud of me, bub. Gail? Gail? Hold on one sec. I just wanted to say I, uh... I thought you dealt with that really well. No, I mean it - you know, it was a tough call and you're obviously getting really good at this. Gail, the whole marriage thing, it's probably not as bad as it sounds. I mean it. Listen, there's me, with like, a house and a wife and me not yet 21, and her no lover of the rock'n'roll, and I'm out on the rip. It was an unholy alliance, but I probably should have mentioned it. - Yeah, you should have. - Wait, wait, Gail, before you go. I wanted to talk to you about something so I wrote it down. No, uh, the thing is, Gail... I was never good enough. I was never good enough at music and certainly not at life and that's a... that's a hard thing to take... because I didn't have a place and then I met these crazy Aboriginal girls and one amazing woman and I had a place and I liked it. So if I've ruined all of that, then I'm an idiot. But you knew that already. No, don't look at it now. For the love of God. Just read it when I'm not around. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get down! - What's happening?! - We're under attack! We're calling in the sharpers. - What? - We're gonna get you out of here. Let's go. You three, with me. Get over there. Go, go! Get to the chopper! Keep moving! Keep moving! Gail! Go! Move it, move it, move it! Inside. Get in. Go! Where's Julie and Kay? OK, I gotta go get the girls. Julie! Kay! Dave! Dave! - I need your help. - Shit! Didn't you say you had medical experience? Here, hold this. I clean a hospital. I don't think it counts. Then you can clean up here. Get your nigger hands off me. Keep that black dog away from me. Shhh. Now, I know it might seem a little odd that I write a letter but certain things are best said from a distance, especially when you're addressing a woman who thinks she's Cassius Clay. Gail, from the moment we got kicked out of that pub together, I knew you were someone I wanted in my life. Someone to fight the good fight with, and often against. You just had something and I knew it. Don't ask me how or why because I couldn't tell you. All I know is, like the first time I heard Otis Redding sing 'These Arms of Mine'... I knew life would never be the same again. And this is the effect that you've had on me, Gail. So, that being said... it would be a great honour if you would allow me to become part of your family. I would be proud to call your sisters my sisters and your mother my mother and your family my family. Get to the point, blast it. I guess what I'm saying is, will you marry me? Once I've sorted my other little situation out, will you marry me then? There, I've said it. Well, I've written it. You don't have to answer straight-away. I don't mind waiting until we get back home. Anyway, I love you. I have some very sad news for all of you and I think sad news for all of our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis. A single shot took the life of Dr King as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Martin Luther King... Let me tell you how it is for a black Marine in Saigon tonight. His home is burning and here he sits in hell while his brothers and sisters are dying in the streets. It's reasonable to assume that he might begin to question what the hell he's fighting for. These Marines, they need something. They need what you can provide, and they need it tonight. I know you're hurting but I need you to sing. Gail, are we gonna do this? Excuse me, you want something? Excuse me, sir, I have phone call for her. Hello? It's Mum. Mum, how did you know where to find us? That Dave fella fixed it all last week. He's a deadly fella, that one. You give him a big kiss for me. Yeah. Auntie Gerry? It's me, Kay. You're a good girl, bub. Your mum would be so proud of ya. Cyn. I made the biggest mistake of my life, Cyn. - Jimmy? - I want to fix it. Well, you should've thought about that before, eh? I've got fellas lining up to suck my ring off so put Mum back on the phone and leave me alone, blast ya. You know what I want to hear. And I've looked over and I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land. So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man.
