Dig that crazy talk, man. Truck it on down there... Wait. We must away to the king and ask permission to marry these lovely damsels. Hold it. Please holdeth thy... - Oh, oh, let go. - Let go. Ow, ow, ow... What a swell joint-a. A marriage plea, Your Majesty. Your Royal Majesty, we pray permission to wed our sweethearts forthwith. If not forthwither. Permission granted, but not until after Princess Alicia has wed Prince Gallant of Rhododendron. But, sire, when will that be-eth? When the flowers bloom in the spring, tra-la. The spring. The spring. Tra-la. Gadzooks, I planned to marry the princess myself, and someday rule this kingdom. Well, why not, Your Grace? Huh? My soldiers could... Father, I beg leave. Granted. A toast to thee, oh noble king, for giving us grant to wed in the spring. Thou art a matzo-head. Ooh. Ooh! See-eth this? Ouch-a. Ouch-a. Your Majesty, Princess Alicia has been abducted by some knaves I did not recognize. Call out the guards. Notify the FBI. FBI? Yes. Flannagan, Branagan and Izcovitch, detectives. Oh, woe is me. Shempeth, Larryeth, we must rescue the fair princess or we cannot wed. Indeed, indeed, but make thee haste. To horse, to horse. We shall scour the countryside. Wait, our steed is not shod. Sue has not a shoe. Then we will shoe Sue, for if Sue has no shoe, a-shoeing Sue we must do. They're off-eth. Blacksmith. Blacksmith. Blacksmith. Blacksmith, where art thou? Wait a minute. "Gone to rest under the spreading chestnut tree. Will Idge, Blacksmith." Shempeth, get yon bellows and keep the forge red hot. We'll shoe Sue ourselves. Larryeth, stoke yon fire, I'll help thee. B.O. B.O. B.O. Whew. Your best friend should tell thee. Shaketh a leg with yon bellows. Fanneth me with a breeze from yon bellows lest I suffocate from the heat. Nay, but I cannot. Pump yon bellows, varlet, pump. See-eth? Giveth it to me. Thou art a lame brain. Stoppeth this nonsense. Hath thou forgotten the princess? Aw, buttoneth up thy lip. Strange. There was water just a second ago. Maketh haste, and get some hot horseshoes from yon forge. Time marcheth on. Take this hammer and beat the shoe. Nay, I have not the heart to beat an innocent shoe. Thou art a dumb cluck. Oh. Ah! Ah. Ahh... Oh, ah, ah. You bringeth Sue forward. Larryeth, you helpeth him. That's a girl, Sue. That's a girl. That's it. Shempeth, lift the mules foot and pass it to me. Okay-eth. Suzy, lift your leg now. Come on, Suzy, lift your leg. Don't be stubborn. Come on, Suzy. Lift your leg, Sue. Idiot. Thou hast made me shoe the wrong mule. Hold still. Hold still, now. Oh! I think you didst that on purpose. Quiet. See that? Yes. Ooh! Ooh! Let-eth a man show you how to shoe Sue. Hm. I will fix thee, wise guy. This hammer will hold thy tail down. Yes, sir, smarty cat. Giveth me thy foot, giveth me. Moe-eth. Where are we? Let's get out of here. Let's find out. Quiet, lads. Quiet. We must listen for the signal bell. Then we will push the princess up the ladder into the magician's box. So they've got the princess. We've got to do something. Yeah, but they're heavily armed and they outnumber us. Let me at 'em. I'll tear 'em limb from limb. Let me at 'em. Well, what's keeping you? Me. Go on. Think. Then it is agreed, Your Majesty, that if I recover the Princess Alicia, through my magic, I may have her hand in marriage? Yes, yes. Just bring back my daughter unharmed. Your Majesty will observe that the box is quite empty. Now then, Your Majesty, I will take my magic robe and with the three magic words: Abracadabra, abracadabra, abracadabra. Now then, Your Majesty. Now, Your Majesty, watch yon box closely and I will perform my magic. I will take yon maiden and saw her in half and in her stead will appear the princess, completely unharmed. Observe. I got it, I got it. What? A terrific headache. Ooh. Get out, you. Listen, we've got to use strag... We've got to use... Strategy. Who's askin' you? Ooh. Ooh. Get out of here. Listen, this is what we got to do: Nyah-nyah. Nyah-nyah. Fear not, princess, I, Shempeth, shall release thee. Scrameth, princess, scrameth. Ah, now to quencheth my thirst. Greetings. Why you... The princess... The princess is gone. Take these miserable wretches to the dungeon and we'll do away with them. Hey, come on. Oh. Get out of there. Quick, upeth the ladder. Water, water. Upeth the ladder. T'was a narrow escape. I think we're safe in this box. Why, you nitwit, you... Shh-shh. Shh. Shut up. Shut up. Oh, sire. My daughter, bringeth her forth. Patience. I now take these swords, for my magic is the greatest, and I plunge it in the box. Larry, helpeth me. Shh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. They got me, they got me. Oh, no blood. No blood. Father. Daughter. Mergatroyd is the culprit. He had me abducted. Why you... Abduct her, eh? Ow! Ow! Ahh! Ow! Ow! Guards! Guards! Taketh him away. Fools, these are my men. - Then lay on. - Lay on. I ought to bludgeon you. Oh, yeah? Where is my sword? Eh, let me have a sword. Why... Oh, t'was an accident, Your Majesty. Oh! Oh, coppin' a sneaker, eh? Why, you... Get-eth him, lad. Cleave him asunder. I'll kill you to pieces. Why... Why, you... Throw away thine sword. Hit him with thine fist. You miserable little... In the labonza. In the labonza. An upper cut. An upper... Why, you... Hold this. Moe-eth, art thou okay? Ow. He is okay. Wait a minute, Moe. Purely an accident. Oh, wait... Wait-eth, Moe, hurt me not. Moe-eth. Shempeth. Larryeth? Tillyeth. Millyeth. Lillyeth.
