Stop him! There he is! Stop him! We have to get him! Where is he? Where is he? Luther will free us! From the roman bloodsuckers and their pardoners. You will be freed from bond service to those roman murderers. That's what Luther says. Luther belongs to the Bundschuh. (An insurrection of the peasants of Germany in the sixteenth century.) That's what they say. I know it! The common man shall be free and redeemed! Put your iron aside, Markus St?bner. Things in Leipzig will be in best order, in compliance with the Scriptures. We will have a great disputation, with the pontifical Dr. Eck. Every man... Every man can claim to be a priest. A cobbler, a peasant, a tailor. And soon become a consecrated bishop. Better get rid of your robes, my dear pastors. If a peasant can be considered a priest. But not with force, brothers! We will always remain servants before the Lord. Luther is saying this as well! So God's children are to be punished even more? By our messrs the reeves? Who are you? A messenger of God. Thomas M?ntzer is my name. As Luther is fighting in this land, against the pope and his deception, he is also fighting for your corporeal right. The day hell freezes over. When we are all dead. Then it will be better for us. Now! And right here brothers! Disputes with scholars are not enough, however. This! Here! And now! Germany shall be freed from Rome! The whole land will be on your side! Luther! Be ahead of us! Luther! Be... Indulgence! Buy indulgence! Don't you hear the cries of your loved ones? Who cry for help in the agonies of the purgatory! Don't you want to save them through some alms? You... hard-hearted people! Indulgence! Buy the absolution of your sins! Till doomsday! I am telling you in all honesty, because and only because of the one true Christian doctrine, we have to roam about the whole world. How else should we find justice? As long as our miserable Christendom is so terribly torn by rapid wolves, as written in Isaiah 5, Psalm 79. How should there be divine order? As long as God's children are flayed? And harmed? Is it not said by the same prophet, that no fool shall be named a king, and no rich man a master. For justice to prevail in the desert. And the desert transmuted into a field. Bearing fruits of peace. He has to stay with us to bring the Scripture alive. So that my folk shall live in houses of peace. In safe care and proud calm. Amen. He should be banished! Luther shall go to hell! Rather all priests! And the pope himself! Come here! He said it! Fellow students! Luther was our master. He wrote of the freedom of a Christian. - that the common man shall be free! Yes! Freedom! Does your majesty want to allow this heretic, who was banned by our holy pope, to speak in Worms? Event grant him safe conduct? He has many adherents. It is the sovereigns who support him. The sovereigns... They want to see your majesty's power weakened. They are about the power. About the property of the church. So you think, by putting my imperial ban on this monk from Wittenberg, I would restrain the princes? And strengthen your friendship with the Holy Father. Who would strengthen you in Spain, in Austria and in Germany. Long live our brother Martinus! Martinus Luther! I ask you, dear royal cousins has there ever been someone like him before, making such a fuss in Rome? The emperor pulled a wry face. Because he needs the pope in Spain and in Austria. And in Germany, against us, the princes! Quiet! You know how it is cousin Saxony... I tell you, we will hear the bird sing! There, in its green cage, in your castle, it will trill its song all too lovely! Cousins, please! A cheer for our nightingale from Wittenberg! A plea, we should file a complaint with the masters! You, Hans Busch! Your sister should deliver it to the master, or to the council. That works better. Oh, dear! So that they can treat the girl with their haughtiness? No! We need a head, a leader! Who has the right words for our needs. We can no longer go on like this. Serfdom, bondage, drudgery, tariffs... Levies and fees! That's the way it is! Yes! Out with the council members! Out with the council members! Out with the council members! Out with the... Council member Qualm! Be quiet. How come you flock together like this, my friends? Friends? We ain't your friends! But I am your friend! See... I, council member Qualm, know where the shoe pinches! Master! Just give us something to eat! Give us some acres of land! I don't even have a shirt on my body! I bow in salutation, sir council member! I will deliver your greetings. And only represent your own case! The cask with lard could do with some blood! Yes! The guy with the torn vest. Keep an eye on him! You grab him afterwards and bring him to me. Father, in my dreams, again and again.. and for that, he says, count Mansfeld had ordered to rip off his tongue! I can hear him, again and again, crying for justice and retribution. But.. doesn't it come only at the end of the world? At Judgement Day? And what if the Lord will hold the Last Judgement here already? Now? One nod and the whip will strike. But even if you ridicule me, I am your friend. And I would like to hear more about all our rebellious fellows. But... I don't know anything... I have patience. I can wait. Alright, Barbara. Alas! Well? My little lamb. Help! Help! What are you doing? Dog! Barbara! Who was that? It was Hans. Hans Busch? Back? Back? Back into the sinful life? Into the life God gave to me. M?ntzer speaks from her! God speaks from her! The creator of all things. And the Lord said, get up. Let us create man. An image equal to us. So God created created man. A man... and a woman. And said unto them be fertile and multiply. And populate the earth! You want to go to Allstedt, sir pastor? Yes, to Allstedt, what do you think Ottie? There is troublous folk in Allstedt, sir pastor. I prefer troublous folk to folk that is as meek as a lamb! Stop! No! I was born... too... early...! Yes... where I will come today... My luck... will come... only tomorrow! You can't think of anything better sir studiosus? Is there a better song? If I had the emperorship, and the Rhineland-Palatinate as well! The iron has to pass through the fire to be forged! And because the peasant is the iron, that is getting forged - everything has an order! There is no good iron without fire and a stroke of a hammer. There is no brunt and no force. Of course everything was better in Adam's time, no? It seems that you knew Adam quite well? God had to expel Adam from Paradise because he fell to sin! Yes.. but why did God allow Adam to fall into sin, sir pastor? Yes! What is the reason that God made man not more complete? If he is almighty? People! What are you talking about? Yes! We want to give the pastor a catechetical sermon. Is it not mentioned that His thoughts are not our thoughts? And His ways are inscrutable. And what if we ask Him? Thomas... M?ntzer! Brother Thomas! Thomas M?ntzer... You remember me? I am pastor Haferitz. I was expecting you for a long time. Away! Away with the sheep! Stop! Stop! Stop! Brothers! Help! Hans! You are still here? My sister! A half... Hear Ye! He knocked down the bailiff. Certainly not without any reason! Not only did he cheat us out of half of your yield. Have a look at this! Get away... What's this? Thomas! Not like that brothers! The world was rescued by the word. The word of Christ! You see. Order must prevail. And I say, order has yet to come. Is it, my brothers, in accordance with the law of Christ, if the strong take honor, justice and bread from the weak? And when the common man fights back, he gets flogged and enchained. This is your order! But would it be Christian to put oneself against the law? The law... is the law, Is the law there to serve the people? Or the people to serve the law? This is how I think! A law that is against the people, is not a law anymore! Even if you nail it with golden letters on the church spire! You should talk like this to Mansfeld! Maybe your ardent zeal helps to free the prisoner. Where? Where is he? This was your intention! He distracted us with his talk, and the captive got away! He has to go to the jail! Not without us. Not without his wife! With all of us! Yes! You don't have to be afraid, that you will have to pay for it. I will give my word for you. You? Who are you anyway? I am Thomas M?ntzer. If someone should ask you, From Easter I will be pastor in Allstedt! Thomas M?ntzer. Right. So? What will you do? You claim to be a horsemen of count Mansfeld? You are chickens! Ernst! Thomas M?ntzer is his name? Thomas M?ntzer my lord. And if only one of my peasants or miners dares to attend his sermon! I will throw him in the dungeon! But the children who are crying for bread are consoled with promises of Manna from heaven! And with heavenly justice. Because the earthly law bestows everything to the rich. But for the common man it has nothing. Yes, that's right. Yes, yes. But how can it change? Some of these clerics want to blindfold the people and dull their minds by putting idolatrous chumps draped with gold into the churches. He is speaking like the archangel. The new pastor. And he sounds so reasonable, it comes from the heart. God is in your works, in your heart, in your reason. That's why you have to teach yourself as well ordinary man! So that you are no longer seduced! And it will be as it was written in the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel. Power shall be given to the common people and to the community! And it should come by the sword. But the wicked will fall at our feet! Even if they might be big shots. And the idolatrous oil paintings and golden chumps shall shatter on the ground like lousy jugs. That's Right! The big shots shall be smashed like clay jugs on the ground! He means the images of the saints. They are of less use to us than the jars. - of the princes and big shots. Victory will be ours! And the wicked tyrants will be doomed! Amen. We will sing Veni, Creator Spiritus. As we have translated it into the German language. Come comforter Holy Ghost, from thy bright heav'nly throne; come, take possession of our souls, come father of mercy, o guide our minds with thy blessed light, with love our hearts inflame. and with thy strength, which ne'er decays, It sounds so good in our language. And everybody can understand it. Far from us drive our deadly foe; and bring true peace unto us. You can call me a Turk, if he didn't say, that we shall smash the graven images! Your are right. Come along, all of you! To Mauerbach! To Mauerbach! Let us leave Barthel, the count forbade us to listen to the pastor. We will not allow to be deprived of the word of God and righteousness. The word of God... - Jesus, just come with me! ...is above the count's word. Don't be afraid. Allstedt doesn't belong to the count of Mansfeld. No one is allowed to seize you. But the duke is above the municipal law. His henchmen are everywhere, and they also play into the hands of the count of Mansfeld. This is a sin and disgrace! That has to go down! He said it! M?ntzer! Yes! They did the same in Swabia! And we cannot be inferior! Yes! Because out of these waxen limbs only golden coins rain down on the cloisters! So that the nuns go to hell together with the monks! Come here! Think of us on our way, and keep us safe from our foes. They guard the borders! Holy god! Now the disaster is here! Get out your sticks! This will mean blood! Let's see who will attack us. Who dares to exchange a good word with them in Christian freedom? Come along then! Alright. No quibble! No long words! Stop! Friends! What do you want? You know the ban of the count! Is the count allowed to forbid us the word of God? Silent! Mauerbach is burning! Extinguish the fire! Extinguish the fire! Stop! Stay here! Extinguish! Extinguish! Extinguish! Away! In other places it is not just doghouses like our chapel in Maurbach, that go up in flames! A new wind is blowing in the south! Monasteries and castles are standing ablaze and burn down together with the vermin! And they were freed from levy and serfdom! Free! Free! Here! They are coming! Evangelical freedom! Now! You could be my twin brother! Better not! But even Mansfeld will understand this sermon. You are all too nice! Feast on the meal, my friends! And enjoy the marvellous gifts of God. Come here! Goddammit! Don't mind me! Dear friends. What is it? They are looking for us! Children! - Come! Run away from here! - Come! Flee! There he is! The dog is here! Get in and catch him! The dog! Look there! Go away! Clear off! No! You can't take my man! Smoke it out, this wasps' nest! That's the instigator! That guy! Instigator! My husband! Let him go! Leave him alone! Oh God almighty! Let my husband go. The count was instituted by God. Here it is. Jeremiah. Chapter One. Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. to pluck up and to break down, I make you this day a fortified city against the kings and their officials! Be frank, brother Thomas, do you want peace? Or uproar? Who is inciting the riots? Brother Simon? The peasant? Who wants to hear the word of God? Or the count, who forbids him and pillages everything? Well. If you don't want to listen to me, would you listen to Luther? What is Luther saying? Even if the authorities are doing wrong, that doesn't excuse an uproar! There is nothing worse than an inflammatory man. I don't believe it. They slander Luther. I am telling you nothing but the truth. You make a God out of these peasants. But Luther says, oat straw belongs in a peasant! And so I say, horse manure belongs in a gentle person? From the princely horse stables? I say! Well. Brother Simon. I will send a serious Christian word to the count. Maybe... for him to hear. And to decide the dispute. They can break us when we are alone. But when we are together, we are a powerful rod. For the big masters. Lord. But if you, dear noble count, want to persist with your nonsensical action, I will denounce you as a tyrant and flayer in front of all Christianity. A disturber of the heathen. Is it really that bad Thomas? This is men's business my dear Ottie. It could frighten you! I followed you out of the cloister Thomas, through the cities and over the streets. But now... The child? What should I do with it? Shred it. And the count? Should he continue to burn and flay? And deny the people of Mannsfeld the word of God? I have to comply with Luther's word. We have to learn to endure the injustice of the authorities. It is only the task of our wordly lords and princes to punish and condemn. Who hold the sword of God. No, Thomas! No! That's not you! I don't like you like that. You are surely often a furious hedgehog, who hisses and stings. But you are M?ntzer! Where do you want to go? To the messenger. The letter has to go to the count today! Watch out, Ottilie! Take care of the little one. It is still very safe. He shall become a boy. A you! Just like you! Has it ever happened, since the creation of this world, that a priest... wrote such a letter to a count? This is not a priest, dear count. But? The people cling to him. Like to a prophet sent from God. Sent by God... I am coming! Splendid, captain Zeiss. A terrific prophet! But we still have more chains, than wild dogs. I will add so many colors, until the whole rainbow appears! As a sign of friendship between God and man. Oh Thomas, why is it that humans can't be kind one to another. They can. This is why we shall form our alliance. To the alliance? Up. B?rbel! Is this enough? Thank you, friend. You see, doing good carries interest. I can see a certain number of whiplashes. And what do you intend to do now? Well... If you should refuse, into the lion's den alone. I have to step Companions! The duke asked M?ntzer to come to his castle. To deliver a sermon! - what? This is a trap! Mansfeld got him into it. No, we won't let you go to the castle! - you must not! We ask him to come here, to us! To Einst?dt. Him and his noble cousin, the count of Mansfeld. Quiet! There he is. Swabian Hannes! He comes from the south. From the Franconian and Swabian brotherhood. Oh brother, did we meet before? We already know about you, dear pastor. Down in Swabia. That you fight against the big shots, and... is reading Mass in German! See, brothers, that's how powerful the word is. It flies through the country, faster than a falcon. Yes. The word is as fast as a falcon. And betrayal is as nimble as a viper. Is this your message? This... as well. Nothing but the justice of God. This comes from Wundschuh? From our evangelical brotherhood in Swabia and Franconia. Did you go all over Germany for that? Our alliance sends regards to the brotherhood. And to the brave pastor. Thomas! Look, Thomas! It is finished! Ottilie! And God said, I have set my rainbow in the clouds and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Yes, brothers. Who dare's to fight with us for the gospel, as a matter of life and death, will be part of our alliance. What will happen to one, will happen to all of us. What belongs to one, belongs to all of us. If one should be in need, all of us will be on his side. Satan made himself a nest in Allstedt. And has his spirits proclaim M?ntzer's teachings there. Doctor Luther is worried. In his sermon M?ntzer is threatening, he says, not only count Mansfeld. But all of us! He wants to smash all great men and monarchs, God forbid, like jars made of clay. He teaches that everything has to belong to everyone. His mouth should be slapped, either way! Didn't you want to invite him to your castle, to deliver a sermon? To have him locked up immediately, for ever! Wrong, brother Johann. Think of my Luther! Didn't we make the nightingale from Wittenberg out of the falcon of Worms? Go on and domesticate M?ntzer, and he will sing for you too. Luther, you say? Wrote to the duke to disperse the people from Mansfeld? You wanted to incite a turmoil amongst the mob. Thus the monarchs and I give you this advice for your own safety. Refuse! Don't go! I will go. I can report to the duke... - don't be inconsiderate Thomas! I will deliver a sermon. Sermonize Thomas? Don't get crazy with your words! Crazy? If you preach that power should belong to the common man - is that the word of God? The word continues to develop. Like man in time. Even the word of God! And the duke shall hear it too. Please calm your anger, dear pastor. Come. Tell him what you saw. Armour-clad horsemen arrived at the town hall. They said that they want to take pastor M?ntzer with them! From Mansfeld? No, a ducal servant from Weimar! This is a military escort for you, dear pastor. An honor, nothing more. Our iron hardware will want to have a say in that! Rightly so, friends! Hit them, before they know it! Yes! Hit them! You and you! My place is in the council. I'm more useful there. Is he part of the alliance? In the alliance? Yes! Rapp. This Luther... What do you think Hannes? I have the duke's word. He want's to meet me in peace, to deliver the gospel. You take care of the gospel, dear pastor. But rely on the peasant's sword! Alas, dear sovereigns. Our Lord will will tidy up neatly amongst the old earthen jugs with his iron rod. Thus understand, valued fathers of Saxony, that the stone that Nebukadnezar was rolling became truly tremendous! It will fall on the ornamented column and smash it! Whereby the poor people see it much clearer than you. You should recognise it as well. Beloved sovereigns. If not, the sword will be taken away from you! Indeed a lovely sermon that you had for your duke. It is excellent my ducal master, we've managed to lure the fox out of his lair. And what about his barking around and putting the country into a flurry? Like the whistler in M?hlhausen? We have to get rid of him. But first he has to dispute with Luther. So that they say, Luther against M?ntzer. Only then the time has come. Father, you've promised that I can wear it already. I have the chain Armour under my vest. See? Capture him? Here and today? In front of the territorial assembly of estates? What's that Dr. Br?ck? Inquire after their wishes. People, what do you want? We want to say the amen to the sermon of our dear pastor M?ntzer. Hail! Join our ranks brothers! So that our earth will become the kingdom of heaven! This earth shall belong to us! Amen! Oh M?ntzer be our man, you interpret the scripture for us, together... So. Now you can paint M?ntzer on your chain Armour. ...the kingdom of heaven will come... We have to start knowing, and stop our foolish believes, dear chancellor. What should I say to them? They want to know what the duke thinks about evangelical freedom. The duke adhere's to the holy scripture. Whereby spiritual freedom is not to be extended upon secular life. Well then, dear chancellor, you and the duke can live in the spiritual world. And leave the secular life to the us commoners. Then all disputes will come to an end. The eyes. Thelen Hans. As a deterrent and as a punishment against misdeed and inflammatory speech, the tongue. Peasant Barthel Krumbach, As a deterrent and as a punishment against misdeed and inflammatory speech, a hand. This, you see, is the duke's answer. I foresaw it. And what will be your answer? Something he understands. Brother Simon. You will bring the peasants into play. Brother Thomas. But how will you stop them? Who says I want to stop them? So there will be an upheaval tomorrow. And what do we have today? Look around. Oppression. Hunger. Tears. Torn out tongues. And chopped off hands! Eternal despotism! And no kingdom! Did God create man for this? Do you human being want to interfere with God's plan? Yes I do. I will! We will fulfill His word! Go on and praise this fiend and bark like savage dogs. But woe to you! Brother... - I am not your brother anymore! Go away! My curse upon everyone, who will follow him! Do you want to wait until the duke's horsemen will come for you? Come to us, come. Before the duke strikes. M?ntzer's father already ended up as a rioter on the gallows. Here are the first records from Stolberg in the Harz, where M?ntzer was born and spent his childhood. He was a student in Leipzig, 1506. In Frankfurt, he became a magister and baccalaureus theologiae. Vicar in Halberstadt. And, uh, here... Being 22 years he founded a secret society. An alliance to overthrow archbishop Ernst in Magdeburg. Prince-primate of your uncle's empire. Then he became a fugitive, and... here, he starts to make trouble in Zwickau and Prague, and is chased away subsequently. In the meantime he is acting as a confessor, primarily in nunneries. Enough. Grab him! Don't cry woman. It's in Jeremiah, M?ntzer says. That we have to become a massive wall against the rulers and chiefs. There will be no way without blood. And if - we want to strike the first blow! And it has to count! My vesper books. Good. The German mass. And my latest sermons. The monarchs won't think very highly of them, Thomas. All the more the common man. What... what do you need the coat for? They say there is a harsh wind in winter on the Swabian alp. You are my brave wife. Your hellish words hit me hard. I only want to be your wife. Your Ottie. Oh, Thomas. Isn't it allowed not to be brave, for once? Don't forget us completely over this great struggle. Thomas, me and the little one. Forget you? You and the little one? Finally they will burn out the ulcer. The bird has flown out! We don't want to be servants anymore. We all want imperial privilege. Awake? Hannes, This night I have dreamed of Thuringia. I saw Ottie and the boy. It is too long, since I am away from home. Three years. Or five? It is a good five months. But you made five years out of it, with all that you put into this time. From Thuringia to Lake Constance. And now in Swabia you are already in a hurry again. Get up! They cleared the way! Shoot! Knight! Do you know me? You have to join the band of the peasant sarges! You have to leave just now? I have to. Heinrich Pfeiffer from M?hlhausen is calling for me. A storm is brewing there as well. Our followers are now in the majority! M?hlhausen has to become the centre piece in the fight for Thuringia. We have to stand together profoundly from now on. You in the south, and we up north. We have enough to do already and can't split up to the north. This is exactly what will weaken us. Do you want to lecture captain Krumpe? Calm down Krumpe! There's some truth in what they are saying. How strong is your force? In M?hlhausen, Allsted and the smaller villages alone we have not less than ten thousand pikes and swords. And three thousand miners. Here is the letter of consignment. Thanks! We will count on you! Thomas M?ntzer is asking for right of abode in our town. We have to be careful here! Excuse me your grace. Lord Ottera please take care that this letter will arrive safely and without delay at the hand of the duke. Before the new regiment remelts our last bells into equipment and artillery. You became part of M?ntzer's alliance in Allstedt, councilor Qualm? And M?hlhausen's council would be well advised to let some of it's members become part of Pfeiffer's alliance. An alliance with them? Who are saying everything should belong to everyone? This would mean my home, my warehouse, my wife? - wait councilor. Until the journeymen find the keys on their own. To the basements and bedchambers. Therefore, we will join the alliance. Never! They are coming. Come, Anna! Hans, this is Heinrich Pfeiffer. He calls the shots now! He took the rap for it long enough. Hail Pfeiffer! Hail Pfeiffer! A runaway monk. But he has the voice and support of all the disaffected folks. Agitator, wretch. Long live the servant of God! Hail Thomas M?ntzer! The friend of the people! The protector of the poor! Bodungen is in a real strop because he has to catch up with M?ntzer, who is acting like a vanquisher! This is the hosanna of the tanners, weavers and brewers. Of the distiller and miners. Hail M?ntzer! Brothers! A powerful flood rushes over the earth. The whole of Germany and Romandy is in motion. The master wants to make his game. Brothers! We cannot not be idle. In God's name we have to establish a firm regiment in this place as well. Omnia sunt communia! (All things are held in common) And just as the power of the monarchs will end, a kingdom of righteousness will flourish! Like golden wheat, for the common man, by the common man. Scream girl, scream! We have to hold back now to gain time. Do the math. In February the emperor won the battle of Padua against France. His army was now free to fight the peasants. And already in March the seneschal of Waldburg restructured it. Since then they are attacking from the south. Now we have April. The weather is still unstable, but, our spring will come. You can be sure of it. Otherwise you may despair. The castle reduced to ashes. Cattle and property in the hands of peasants. Just take it away from them again, and they will drag stones and build it anew! This is what our kitchen and cellar can offer these days! Thank you noble landlady, thank you. We need some time before we can expect salvage coming from Lake Constance. I think the best will be to join their alliance to be free from suspicion. My horsemen are lying in wait. Woe to those who support the insurgence. Our walls and buildings are standing firm. We don't even think of giving in. Join their alliance. This will mean one more voice preserving our interests. You can distract them which will buy us time. In the meantime we can negotiate with the large bunch, and castigate the small. Now? Will they have faith in me? Don't they live by faith? Those idiots. - and to accept me, before we start with the debate, as part of your alliance. So be it! Think about it sir syndic, hard times are ahead of us. That's why I am asking you as well. Me too. Me too! Me too. Me too. If God put his faith into man do we have a right to be suspicious? Hans! The flag. Since all of the treachery, hardship and mischief grew out of castles and monasteries, they shall be under our mundane banner from now on. And the castles shall be shattered. What should we vow? Do you think this is unjust? It is God's will. Are you ready to pledge allegiance to the flag on grounds of the wording of the law? Brotherly allegiance, and mutual help to establish the holy gospel. We vow. You took a vow that according to our law every possession will be shared collectively. Even church property. Which will be assigned to the peasants for their own use and work! And noble properties as well. I hope the gentlemen will not mug us during work. For this we have to burn these thieves dens to the ground! Our brothers in arms will support us in this. We owe obedience to the council only! Not to the alliance. To all of the people! Thus also to the alliance. Shall we all take another oath now? No. But I ask you, armed sons of the people. Do you really want to strike out unquestioningly, on command? Even against your fellow countrymen? Turning our beautiful country into a slaughterhouse! Is this what you want? We don't want this! Egad! This is not for what we were recruited. But for the council and the town! For the council and for the town. Can there be any town without the people? Who are living in it? How can you take an oath to the town and the council and not the people at once? Who stands by the good law, the old law, come to me! Treason and betrayal! We need to set up a new council so that the people and the council will go together in the future. One that will not disperse. One appointed for life. This could mean a long, but also a short time. For this it should bear the name the Eternal Council. What if the electoral prince should die? From the river Werra to the Vogtland, from the Thuringian Forest to Harz, fires flare up everywhere. The end is not far off. - and give you peace. Amen. Maybe we gave these poor people a reason to act like this. If it is the will of the almighty... Brother! Luther is requesting that we should withstand, and resist! Dear Friends, the electoral prince is dead! The rebels are seeing that their time is coming. They flock together in the thousands, all over the place. Only a few fortresses can withstand. It will be futile on a large scale, but if you have any knowledge, where individuals are located, then let's put them on the rack! Ask under torture who is allied with them! And then, stab and knock them down! Starve out! Debase! Burn! Get them out, out of their hiding places! Let them have it! Chase them away, beyond the borders! I don't share the opinion of brother M?ntzer, to attack count Mansfeld at castle Heldrungen. No! Sure! This will be a bloodshed! And will weaken our M?hlhausen! Ha, our M?hlhausen? It shall be God's passion. The peasants of Eichsfeld are calling for help. To chase their masters away! I recommend to take away the property of the monastery and bolster our own supply. I only have an advisory vote here, but brothers, what's all this about? Isn't it a waste of time? Are we only about cattle and loot? Or are we fighting for Protestant freedom? Don't forget friends, God's kingdom is not hanging from a church spire. M?hlhausen has to become an invulnerable fortress! We received the news, that thirty-thousand peasants sealed an agreement with their masters in the Allg?u. Shamefully! The princes array their troops against us! That's why, brother Heinrich, we should unite with our loyal brothers in the south. And then move against the princes with all our might. To unite with our brothers? Did you hear? Heard and approved. To stay or march out, we need artillery for both. Oh well, Conz Merz, Where to get hold of it? Where from? Where from? We can remelt the bells into cannons and rifles. Well targeted is half the prayer. Well targeted is half the prayer. That doesn't belong in the protocol. Shall we delete it? It shall stay. We have nothing to hide. Yes friends, come on! Come on! While it is still a day! Because as long as the wicked reign, we will not be without fear. Your alliance... It gave us nothing but misery and fear. In former times we served in Mansfeld and had a peaceful living! Where is my husband? A curse upon you M?ntzer! If we go south, we will refuse the people of Frankenhausen? Refuse them? Refuse them, how can we refuse them? Eight thousand peasants gathered there. Wandering about aimlessly, without any advice or support. Did you hear that the people of W?rzburg are calling too? And maybe the ones from the Black Forest. And from Lake Constance. From Swabia too. I won't allow that our M?hlhausen will get abandoned! The electoral prince Johann threatens from the east. Braunschweiger from the north. And the wild landgrave of Hessen from the west. We have to forestall them Heinrich. Before they can unite! We have to block the mountain passes. And our main body - will unite with the W?rzburger bunch? Right! And keeps in contact with the rest. But... who should lead them? No one! What? Here! My house! And my yard! Mansfeld did this? You did it! You with your sermon and your kingdom of heaven on earth! You forget yourself peasant. And now there is pillage and murder! How can we prevent it? Is it not true, that many rich councilmen escaped from M?hlhausen? You approved of it! But nobody supports us. Help us and we won't be angry with you, and won't rebuke God. God will be very thankful for your benevolence. Do you want to bargain with God? For the great struggle? Haha, the "great struggle"! It appears to me, as a whole, that brother Thomas' plan is good. It is great. But there is only one who can get it across to the crowd. Do you want to send him to the armed troops again? Don't you have someone else? What do you think, brother Heinrich? Well, Frankenhausen is not far. If you allow me, I will come with you. But you have to provide us with good supplies. And add rifles to the hand weapons. We will go all out! Call the cobbler! Taken all together, We need to take control of the forest passes in Thuringia. And drive a wedge between the Swabian, Franconian and Thuringian peasant mobs. And then off with the heads of all the traitors. May I remind you, royal highness, that the seneschal of Waldburg made a pact with the peasants of Weingarten too. You dare to compare your cowardice with his audacity? He, the seneschal was surrounded by peasant pikes. The papist was able to fend for himself. With a letter of reprimand to all the peasants, written by our Luther. He signed a peace treaty with every single peasant mob, one at a time. Thirty thousand laid down their arms. And afterwards he attacked the scattered mobs! This is what I call a ruse of war! But your pact was betrayal! Royal highness! - enough! County and knighthood, abbot and convent of Fulda will pay nineteen thousand gold pieces to their overlord for this treason! Hey! Are you M?ntzer's bunch on the way to Frankenhausen? Only the tip of it's nose! M?ntzer is coming tomorrow. With a mighty force. We are in the right place then! Hail M?ntzer you are our man. You interpret the scripture for us. What's that kid doing here? They say that girls will be present at the crack of doom! We will find salvation amongst the likes of us. Thomas. Can I tell you something? Yes Ottilie. Thomas, I don't think that Pfeiffer knows it, but Othera is playing a dishonest game. I have to go to Frankenhausen. Who is saying that you have to? My inner voice. Is your inner voice always right Thomas? And always dictated by God? Would you say it comes from Satan? Satan, God, why not from a human being? In that case from Barthel who's hand was chopped off because he wanted to listen to my sermon. And from Thelen Hansen who had to give away his tongue. And from Apel whose farm was burned down and who cried in his desperation "M?ntzer did it"! I don't mean it like that Thomas! But that's the way it is! Ottie... what if it is really Satan's voice? And not God's? If it would be hell I was preaching? And not the heavenly kingdom? What if everything came to early? Too fast? Too much? No Thomas. There are thousands who are waiting for you. And you, Ottilie? You, to make one single person happy. Is this too little? Is this not the kingdom of heaven on earth? Luther's newest pamphlet is the best welcome address. Take the title alone, Against the murderous, thieving hordes of peasants. Therefore let everyone who can smite, slay and stab, secretly or openly. Remember that nothing can be more poisonous, hurtful or devilish than a rebel. It is just as when one hast to kill a mad dog. A very clear declaration. And when chancellor, can we expect reinforcements? Duke Johann is setting out today. And duke Georg's main unit is on its way since yesterday. Good cannons and two cavalry units. Now we only have to set back the peasants, so that they can't disperse into the woods. The letters addressed to them are finished. Let's see if the birds will fall for this trick. We will make it. Our strength is in our numbers. If we commoners stick together we can strike all of them dead, only with our felt hats! Still no message from them. You are too hasty. As if we had so much time. This will be respected. Do you have the message for the landgrave? Should I carry it through the camp myself? Where do you plan to take this, Apel? Home. It's been long enough since we are away from our village and fields. You want to steal away with the loot, like a fat hamster? Now? When we will go all out? Who gave you permission to leave the camp and fetch the prey? What's it to you? I am one of your superiors! And I ask you as a peasant. And as a peasant a answer to you, I will get what was taken from me. Brother. Isn't this our all concern? If you all disperse like this you will lose. I swear! Not only the cart and the prey, you will lose your head! You should be impaled with a pike! I tell you, the princes and their mercenaries are moving in from all sides. If you don't stand up against them, here with us, you will end up over there, under the field very soon! Markus! Hannes! Where is M?ntzer? On his way to us. With a whole army of peasants! Do you have important news from the south? Many peasants are thinking like you. They want to go home with their loot and don't die here on these fields. The princes don't want to shed any blood either. They want to settle amicably with you. Here, take this. This will hold as a symbol of recognition for you. Pick it up! Defiant folks. All is going haywire until the right Protestant spirit moves into the camp with M?ntzer. He is really taking his time. And is sorely missed on all fronts. Indeed, he took the bandage off of our eyes. What person have I been before M?ntzer gave my faith a reason and a right purpose for all my doing. I was nothing more than an obstinate, rebellious fellow. A good-for-nothing, with a restless soul. Stay here B?rbel. You belong to us girl. I promised to help the artilleryman. If I am not mistaken, you would not say 'no'. if I would ask brother M?ntzer to lay her hand into yours. As soon as it is fought out. God's blessing on it, brothers. He is coming! M?ntzer is coming! With a whole army of peasants! You see, the Christian brotherhood is sending us loyal reverences. Read, if you are able to. We acknowledge Jesum Christum, - well, I never! We don't want to harm anybody, but are asking for the justice of God. No blood should be shed. If you agree, we will do you no harm. They will stand to their word. Do all brothers in the camp think like you? Almost all. Something happened, we need to discuss. This moment prophet M?ntzer is entering the peasant camp. Qualm said that he won't come? Get out! We have to separate him from the bulk of the peasants. Let's offer them a truce to conduct amicable negotiations. And a complete pardon, if they extradite the false prophet. Victory will be ours! Hail! Welcome to the peasant camp captain M?ntzer. It seems to me that I haven't been a soldier before. It is good, my brothers! Brother Thomas! You appear to us like Gideon. Blessed be this day! Hail! Mertz, an experienced dressmaker. Gideon! Mansfeld is in for a shock. What have I seen along the way, one atrocity after the other. It is about time my friends that we bring count Mansfeld before the court. He started with torturing the Christians! He designates our holy faith as a mere childish prank. Fire! Sword! And torture are raging! We will write to him today and demand his answer. - and if he remains silent? We will do it like our Swabian brothers did at Weinsberg with Helfensteiner. Drag him in front of our peasant pikes, in the name of the Lord! Who will deliver the letter to Mansfeld? After our last messenger was cut into pieces? So use the knight for once. I will undertake this arduous task. Didn't I tell you brothers? You have to believe in man. And if we hadn't come, you would have stayed faithful to their alliance. Read the inspiring letter to the end. Behold, you miserable bag of maggots. Who made you a ruler of the people that were paid dearly for by God with his own blood? That's enough! Give it to me! Thomas M?ntzer, with the sword of Gideon. Let's snap at them with our cannons, before he continues to incite the whole camp with his devilish deeds. Extradite this M?ntzer, immediately and unconditionally. It is he alone who holds the whole pack together. With his head everything will fall apart. Dominus vobiscum. (The Lord be with you.) Et cum spiritu tuo. (And with thy spirit.) Oremus. (Let us pray.) Spiritum nobis, Domine, (Pour forth into us,) tuae caritatis (o Lord) infunde. (the spirit of thy love.) Ut quos sacramentis (So that those) paschalibus satiasti, (who are sated with thy Easter Sacraments) tua facias (enter in harmony) pietate concordes... (by thy grace...) - of patience or compassion. It is a time of the sword and wrath, not mercy. Yes indeed, as Luther is saying. Times are extraordinarily strange, and it is easier for a prince to earn his way to heaven by a bloodshed than it is for others through prayer. How hard it is to gain knowledge. Even harder to put it into practice. And hardest not to waver. No Lord God, you didn't lead me astray. It cannot be, didn't you show me a new world? A better, more beautiful order on earth? I think, my good son, you should leave the heretic to me and the church, although you are Lutheran. This would mean to Rome and the catholic power. This would mean to all of us, the lords. We do not have him, yet, father. But wouldn't it be your duty as a good Catholic to hunt our Luther as well? And you, cousin Philipp, don't you sympathise with M?ntzer, being a Protestant? Cousin Philipp is wise enough to know, if Catholic or Protestant, we are lords, and they are peasants. Amen. I promised to the cabinetmaker to water the horses. Good, good... Hey, how come you are asleep? Is this the loyalty you owe to the brotherhood? Tomorrow it's happening. We have a God, who helps and rescues from death. Fight. And the victory will be ours. There! Look! Enemy horsemen. What, here? Wait, let them come closer. Maybe they are friends. Kill him! Landgrave Philipp of Hessen! Is it you, master Othera? It is... the wrong one! The truce is over in three hours. We should think about it! I thought we had considered everything? Yes. We will rather die, than turn away from M?ntzer. No more word of negotiation! Spit lead! The morning has arrived. What is left for us to do? Resistance and trying to keep them away. And as soon as we receive our ammunition, our artillery will control the valleys in the south, west and east. First and foremost we have to cover our back. The Kyffh?user hills will provide us cover. And in the worst case we can retreat there. We will stick with our master plan, the march south! Council member Qualm is on the run. Qualm? I saw him up there... - artilleryman R?h escaped to the enemy as well! Tonight. With a bunch of his people. Traitor! Like acorns on the trees. A miracle! The victory will be ours brothers! Have a look at the miracle! Look up to heaven! A miracle! Forgive us our diffidence brother M?ntzer. A miracle! Can you see it? A rainbow. Like our flag. Bring the flag. Brothers! Brothers! Heaven itself is showing our colours! Let us thank Him. Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blessed, and in our hearts take up thy rest. Come with thy grace and heav'nly aid to fill our hearts which thou hast made. O Comforter, to thee we cry, thou heav'nly gift of God most high. Now we have them in the mousetrap. We have to attack before the truce is over! Ruse of war! Fine! Run! Go! Be this our firm unchanging creed, that thou dost from them both proceed. Jesus! Christ! Barthel! Brother! Everybody who means it sincerely, come here! God gave his sign! They are coming from all sides! Back! Get into the wagon! Come on, both units attack! Prepare yourself! Why are our men not shooting? These dogs! Treason! The gunpowder was sabotaged! B?rbel! Bring the captain, treason! The gunpowder is wet! Treason! Do you hear? Treason! Where is the captain? Here with you! Come to me! This way! Tally ho! You peasants! No threats and no messing around anymore! Three woods, three arrows, three fishes to hunt! Hey, Brother! Here! This would have been something for old Adam! There, Pfeiffer! It's his fault, that they lost their free imperial city. And they got M?ntzer as well. I will ask you one more time, what did you want with your alliance? Omnia sunt communia. All things are held in common. And should be divided amongst the people, according to need and availability. And every prince and master who refuses should be pushed off the chair! You preached beautifully pastor. But your friend, count Mansfeld, will surely like to rejoice in this too. We will lend him out to Mansfeld for a couple of days, as share of the booty. Hold on! We will have a sweet dessert! Dear Brother! You may apologise for your striking tyranny. We want your answer! Or we will afflict you with our armies in the name of the Lord. Therefore I adorn Thomas M?ntzer with the sword of Gideon. A stone detached by the hand of the people will smash you like a statue made of filth and clay. Put him on the rack! Hey! Sell her to me. Here. Go! Watch out that he doesn't jinx you. He already had four jars. It seems that he is carrying a flaming furnace within himself. Is it up to you peasant to water the scoundrel? Can I tie my lamb to your cart? Friends! You have dice? Ottie. Our boy is alive Thomas. It must not happen Thomas! We will save you! I have money! And St?bner will... - this cunning, frisky fox. But M?ntzer cannot be saved. Save his word! Preserve the meaning of our endeavour! Then M?ntzer will be saved too. Markus! Markus come here! Quiet Ottie. Be quiet. You know everything. You are my sanity. Save my writings! Send them south to our brothers. Do you hear me? Ottie? I can't go on anymore. I can't go on Thomas! You can, Ottie. You can. Go on! Go on! It was so good to be with you. Ottie. Don't forget us! I was born to early, my luck will only come tomorrow. If I had the emperorship, and the Rhineland-Palatinate, I cannot grasp it this year, the time would not be ripe. The iron has to pass through the fire, to be forged. Brother Thomas, don't you feel a desire for the sacraments of the holy church? Feel the regret Thomas, that you have left the monastery, took a wife and became defiant! And it was not only that you became inflammatory, Thomas. But there are also many poor people you drove into death with your uproar! Don't you regret this? Yes, I feel sorry for the poor people. I wanted too much. My strength was too weak. God forgive me. But you too, masters, don't feel too safe. And read what end the tyrants will take. You mean your end. And so, as it will cease - what is he saying? As the power of the rulers will cease, a realm of justice will blossom, like golden corn. For the common man. By the common man. For the common man, by the common man. You could save them? My wife preserved them. Welcome to our bunch, my lady. Welcome! To our bunch. Welcome! Listen! To M?ntzers message. Here, read. Dear Brothers, we must not sleep any longer. The master wants to finish his game, the evildoers have to be punished. Punished! They will be punished and our day will come!
