14th year of Jian'an, Month 12, Day 17, Season of Great Freeze. That was the year Mu Shun and I were brought to a place with no sunlight. We were no better than stray dogs. We were put through bitter training, every day, and no one told us why. How long can someone survive without hope? I don't know the answer. All' I know is that was the year a look from Mu Shun became my only hope. From today, hold tight the swords in your hands! That sword is your only strength now. And only the strong will leave this place to serve the master! Listen up! This is the prize for tonight's winner! Only one of you will come down alive! Turn over. Get up! Get up! Everyone up! Go! Get moving! Everyone take your clothes off! Strip! Strip! Strip! Faster! Strip! Faster! Faster! Go! Get in the water! Move! Quick! If you want to get out of here, you'll have to be clean! Mu Shun said he kept a garden in his heart. There was no war, no chaos, no massacre or death there. Mu Shun and Ling Ju lived there. They had a field to plough, had clothes to wear, and had sons and grandsons. And Mu Shun said that as long as the hope in his heart was alive, nothing could kill us. Later, I finally learned everything they put us through was to kill one man, the most powerful man in the world. And that was the only way we could earn our freedom. In the winter of the 24th year of Jian'an, I was sent to Bronze Sparrow Tower. That year, Cao Cao allied with Eastern Wu to capture Guan Yu, dead or alive. Emperor Xian of Han brought his ministers to Bronze Sparrow Tower, Cao Cao's palace, lo wait for his return. When the general did return, a blizzard was raging. Thick grow the rush leaves Their white dew turns to frost He whom [ love... Cao Pi! Control yourself! Don't scream... Don't scream... When the kingdom falls to me, I'll make you a real empress. I went down the river to look for him And there in mid-water, sure enough, is he! And there in mid-water, sure enough, is he! Hands off! I'm already an empress! I don't need your title! And there in mid-water... Your Highness, the army returns, in mourning garb. And there in mid-water, sure enough, is he! It's a shame you married that puppet. In the snow, among a crowd of strange faces, I stood alone, awaiting my fate. And there, behind Emperor Xian of Han, in his crowd of ministers and eunuchs, I saw Mu Shun again. How could this happen? Father! Chancellor! How could you leave me so soon? Father! Prepare to receive the King of Wei! Welcome, Chancellor! Chancellor... This performance was quite a shock to me! And no doubt a disappointment to some of you! Guan Yu was killed by Lv Meng when he took Fancheng. Sun Quan, the traitor, sent me Guan Yu's head to sow discord between Liu Bei and I. But I received Guan Yu with full rites! I ordered the army into mourning to hon our Guan Yu in the name of the House of Han. I commend your wisdom, Chancellor! Guan Yu served us loyally, and deserves our full hon ours! Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! My Lord! My Lord! My Lord, my Lord... My Lord, look. Look who I've found for you. This was the most powerful man on Earth? My heart quivered in terror, Mu Shun, I didn't know where you were. How did you get in? The palace sent me to deliver a new medicine for Cao Cao. Will "stars in multitudes" really fall when the four stars align? I don't know if we can escape the disaster those stars are bringing. I've heard he's good to you. That doesn't matter, does it? Isn't this all a game? I have to go back. Be careful. My Lord... My Lord... My Lord... My Lord, they said you were here, so I came, but I wondered if I should, because what if you weren't? But you really are here after all! I'll be as concise as I possibly can. I have a new medicine, and it wasn't easy to find. This cures headaches? No, your loins. Lies! My loins require no curing. My Lord! My Lord! "CLAD IN SNOW" In the year of Geng and Zi, when the four stars align, a new dynasty takes the throne! Lord Astrologer... Greetings, Chancellor. Blizzards followed drought this year. By your readings, when will the balance of seasons be restored? I'm afraid that will be difficult. Are the stars unfavourable? The stars are very favourable! When the four stars align, blood will be spilled. Dynasties change when Geng crosses Zi. This is divine will. Lord of Wei, I implore you, obey heaven's will, and take your prize! Are you aware of the penalty for treason? This is not my desire, this is the will of heaven. Would the Lord of Wei oppose heaven's will? Chancellor, please, take heaven's prize! Those who oppose heaven meet death! Those who oppose heaven meet death! Those who oppose heaven meet death! -Chancellor! -Father! Chancellor! All things proceed in good order, without needless description! The stars will explain themselves without your help! Blasphemers! Seal the doors! From this day forth, the Divination Hall is forbidden to all! Yecheng, Cao Cao's Estate Xudu, Royal Capital As long as your father is alive, the kingdom will never be yours. You know that better than I do, General. You long for something you shouldn't dare to. And I can help you. And if you do gain the kingdom, I'll be your queen. Greetings, my Lord. This is my armoury. The owners of all these blades had a past with me. They fought together with me, or against me, but today, they sleep eternally underground. This halberd was Lv Bu's. In the middle is Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Sometimes, I visit them... I thought I was a god. But I realised I was wrong today. Guan Yu, you were the god. And I talk to them. I have to personally write the memorial of every man here, because I'm the only one who understands them. I don't understand. You've been fighting your entire life, but for what? On the lands outside this palace, every man needs to work, and serve in the army. Every day, every year, and they have to keep going, because with a unified will, one day, the world will be ours. My world ends with the people I care about and a place to call home. The safest place to call home is the dust. Just like them. Since we all return to the dust, what good does gaining the world do? My mother gave it to me. Your mother? Why do I want the nation? When the nation is ours... When the nation is ours, the death, the chaos, the massacres, the struggles between neighbours, that will stop. No death, no chaos, no massacres, no struggles between neighbours... Isn't that the world in Mu Shun's heart? But how many lives and conspiracies will it take to reach that place? Thick grow the rush leaves Their white dew turns to frost Your Majesty, issue the edict. He whom [ love... Your Highness! If we have the will, victory can be ours with this stroke. Our fate hangs on this decision. When the four stars align, does that truly signal of the end of a dynasty? Your Highness, in the fourth year of Emperor Ping's reign Wang Mang and the Red Eyebrows rebelled. The rebellion in Emperor Wen's seventh year, his death, the fall of the Yelang kingdom, and the Yellow Turban Rebellion, all happened under the alignment of the four stars. Your Majesty, if the four stars meeting is not the end of a dynasty, what do you think it is? So killing him will end the danger to my throne? He isn't Dong Zhuo! Very well then! I will issue the edict! You're the ones who forced me to do it! Xudu, Royal Capital Yecheng, Cao Cao's Estate Attack! Assassins! Assassins! Protect the Chancellor! Get behind me! Chancellor! My Lord! My Lord, I'm sorry I'm late! My Lord! My Lord, you aren't hurt, are you? Tomorrow we visit the palace! Yes, sir! Put your sword away. I realised in that moment what a fool I was. If the armies of an entire generation couldn't kill him, how was I, a girl, alone, to kill him? But there are some things, once put in motion, that are impossible to stop. Announcing the Lord of Wei! Announcing the Lord of Wei! Chancellor, royal favour precedes you! You may retain your shoes and blade at court! -Chancellor. -Take them off! Chancellor, royal favour precedes you! You may retain your shoes and blade at court! His Majesty arrives! Ministers, be seated. Our thanks, Your Majesty! Those with petitions, state your business, those without, please retire. I have business! Last night, my hunters caught some excellent wild game I'd like to share with the court. Will Your Grace partake? Very well, then. Let's have a feast! I have one more invitation to extend. To my empress. I'm afraid my stomach won't allow it. Doctor Ji? Right, I'll take a look. And Lord Fu, I've been wanting to share a drink with you for some time. Will you be joining our feast today? I'd love to. Get away from me! So, do I examine her, or not? Never mind, then. Begin the feast. Yes, sir. Chancellor, since you've brought me game, I have a gift for you as well. The Seven Star Dagger! You used this dagger to protect the Han's lands from the traitor Dong Zhuo, and though you failed to kill him, you won many hon ours. Today, I present this dagger to you as an hon our and a warning. As an hon our, and a warning. Your Majesty, I accept your gift! But speaking of assassinating Dong Zhuo, I think that was the decision of a rash, ignorant young man. Chancellor, are you saying you regret your services to the nation? Regret? Since those days, nobles have fought each other for scraps of the nation, all in the name of restoring Han's glory! Does killing one man accomplish that? Begin the feast! Ready, Chancellor! Only the most fortunate ever enjoy a dish like this! When your name is called, step forward to receive your portion. Chief Cavalry Attendant Yang Lie, Royal Adviser Lord Ku Gui, Rites Instructor Dong Huai, Xiaowei Guards Left Commander Chen Meng, Vice-Censor Du Gan, Vice Records Minister Yao Ji. Enjoy. This seems a bit too exotic, Chancellor. We've all had enough fine wine and prime meat to last a lifetime. Let's try something new. Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Why isn't anyone eating? Your Majesty, it looks like you'll have to speak for me. Ministers, sample the delicacy. Eat bear paw! Eat bear paw! How dare you all disobey an imperial decree? Your Majesty, I'll try it. Now, Chancellor, are you satisfied? Before it's been cooked, even before it's skinned, you want the meat. This has nothing to do with anyone else. Lord Fu, I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. Cao Mengde, I was the one behind the attempt on your life last night. Me. Your Majesty, you don't write with your left hand, do you? Tell me, who forced you to do this? Your Majesty, you didn't want my father dead, did you? The Caos have served the Han throne and asked for nothing in return, but if this is what we get for our loyalty, the throne we uphold is seeking vengeance on us, I wonder if a coup isn't in order? Control yourself! Who was it? Cao Mengde, it was me! I forced him to do it! So did I! - Did! - I did! Such a rush. You're all in such a rush. I don't fear having enemies. It's having foolish enemies that frightens me! And enemies like you are nothing short of an insult to me! Arrest them! This has nothing to do with my father! I was the one behind it! If someone has to die, it should be me. You've Killed so many of his empresses, it makes no difference to add another one. I just have one request. I want Cao Pi, himself, to send me to my grave. Cao traitors! Hell has a special place for you! Pestilence upon your house! Father! Father! My daughter, the usurpers will be punished. Be loyal to the last. Death is nothing to fear. Father! Father! The usurpers will be punished. Be loyal to the last. Death is nothing to fear! Do it. What are you doing? Your Highness, she is your queen. Say something. Is there anyone left who would listen to me? You need only speak, Your Majesty, and I will obey. As the Lord of Wei wishes. Traitors! Death is too good for you! You will pay for your crimes! Rise and kill the traitors! He who wins the people's hearts wins the kingdom. Is this heaven's will? The end of the Han? Lord Fu... People indeed cheer for this kind of cruelty? Fu Wan is no ordinary criminal. He tried to have the King of Wei killed. Of course people hate him. Why? In this world, with war and famine everywhere, I know having a warm house and a full belly are a lot to be thankful for, and the Lord of Wei gives us those in Yecheng. Up to that point, I thought Cao Cao's death was the will of the people, that it was justice well served. I also thought it was the only way Mu Shun and I would escape. Did you see what happened to those assassins? -They weren't ours. -So many people want him dead... The master said too many people are watching the court. We're the only ones who can... What happens to us if we fail? We should run. I refuse to believe, in a world this big, that there's no place for us. It's still the Lord of Wei's world. How can we know if we don't try? What's left for a eunuch like me if I leave the palace? I have to go back. My Lord, you should drink your medicine. It's getting cold. Chancellor... Ji Ben... Yes, my Lord. My Lord... What is it? General, you weren't playing at your best today. I dare say your mind was elsewhere. What puts you in such a talkative mood today, Dr Ji? Hardly! I'm happy for the Chancellor. Things are always better with a good lover by your side. He hasn't had his headaches for a long time! My father's bed may be warm, but I go through my days like I'm walking on thin ice. If I'm not mistaken, it's the death of the Fu clan that's troubling you? I feel like it's not finished. The longer he stays silent about it, the more it bothers me. Well, the Chancellor, he gets more difficult to read every day. Pi, come forward. I want to see your face. I'm going to ask you some questions. I only want you to answer yes or no. Chancellor... I was just coming to see you. That night, when the assassins attacked, you knew they were coming, and timed your attack on them, didn't you? Chancellor! I only want you to say yes or no! I... Yes, or no? No. You used your affair with Empress Fu to find out when the assassination would happen, because you wanted to blame the Emperor for the conspiracy, didn't you? No. Son, come here. Chancellor! The Emperor is incompetent, and the days of Han are over. Why do we protect him? -Come here. -Chancellor! The four stars are aligning! If we don't follow heaven's role for us, we're only waiting for them to Kill us! Come here! Chancellor! Don't call me Chancellor. Call me Dad. Dad! I don't think I ever hugged you when you were growing up. Let me look at you. Now, Dad is going to ask you one last question. Had Dad not planned to take over the throne, would you have the thought to kill me? The only reason your dad is alive is that I don't trust anyone. Dad! Dad! The window lamp! Yes, my Lord. We can't have them thinking I'm old. So many people think I'll kill the Emperor, so they try to kill me. Am I that easy to kill? If they don't know my heart, they can't get close enough to strike. As wise as you are, Chancellor, who could harm you? Do you know when the best time to kill me would be? I don't know if my headaches are corrupting my mind, or if my worries are causing my headaches. But if I could fall asleep, and never wake up, it would be the end of my worries. I watched the haggard face of the tyrant, and the records it bore of old wounds and battles. What kind of woman would it take to soften the heart of this man who had never trusted anyone? Suddenly, I found myself missing Mu Shun. When do we strike? Soon, but not yet. Why do we have to kill him? Isn't this what we've been working for? Why are you crying? What are we doing? What we have to do. And then we pass our days together in peace? We go to that place in your heart? In a world like this, where do you think a place like that exists? You said, all we have to do is keep that hope alive. I can't give you what you want. What you want, a truly whole, peaceful life, only he can give you. You're insane. Killing one of them is already a difficult matter as it is. Their armies are formidable. If we do this alone, we'll end up like Dong Zhuo and Fu Wan, dead. Which is why we can't risk all our forces on a single attack. Before the four stars align, on the 15th of the 12th month, when the moon is full, we will crush all the Cao traitors! Now, when the moment comes, our forces will attack from within and out. Chancellor... Father... I know I was wrong. My headaches are getting worse. When news of my condition gets out, the nation will be in danger. I'm afraid our position will change. Are you aware, there have been soldiers scouting around Yecheng? Have you seen them? Gather your men. Bring the Emperor to Bronze Sparrow Tower. Say it's for a hunting expedition. But don't force him. Yes, my Lord. Pi, I trust you. Yecheng, Cao Cao's Estate Xudu, Royal Capital Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor! Ministers, please rise. Our thanks, Your Majesty. Those with petitions, state your business, those without, please retire. Lord Cao Cao petitioning the throne! Speak, Minister. Liu Bei and Sun Quan foment rebellion. Allow me to lead an army to crush them. Cao, you barbarian! You again? You want to launch campaigns, you want to crush rebels... Are you the emperor, or am I? Your Highness... I'm not finished! No, you may not. Your Highness, General Cao Pi seeks an audience. He shall be denied! That bastard's name is the last thing I want to hear! General Cao Pi seeks a royal audience! And regarding what matter do you petition the court? The King of Wei invites His Majesty to Yecheng for a winter hunting expedition. If I refuse? I beg Your Majesty to return to Yecheng with me. Cao traitors seized His Grace for a "hunting expedition” in Yecheng. Get there and protect the Emperor! Chancellor, I'm happy to see you alive and well. I was worried! Ji Ben can't rid me of my headaches completely, but he treats them well enough. Chancellor, you may cancel the winter hunt, if you wish. With war and drought plaguing the kingdom, we need the winter hunt to demonstrate your power. Very true, Chancellor. Your Majesty! Chancellor, shoot. His Highness got one! Long live the Emperor! The bow and arrow belong to you, so the deer belongs to you as well. Do you like deer? We'll go hunting together later. If you like something, do you have to kill it, Chancellor? There's a place I want to show you. My Lord, stop here. This is my final resting place. When I die, I plan to bring this war with me to my grave. And then I'll be buried here, forever. Master, be careful. Jian Bo! I was looking for you, but you weren't here. Mengde! I thought you were dead! I'm not that fast! I'm still waiting to bury you! Will it be finished on schedule? Mengde, are you planning to move in ahead of schedule? No wonder the Chancellor is so soft-hearted today. He brings a fair maiden today? She must be a beautiful young creature. She reminds me of the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, Diaochan... Going blind didn't bother me, because I didn't need my eyes after seeing beauty like that. Three years after retaking Yan Province, winter. Taking of Pengcheng, Siege of Xiapi... Eastern Campaign to Capture Lv Bu. Lv Bu was brave, but lacked strategy. My troops captured him alive in an ambush. Capture Lv Bu! We seized Diaochan with him. Their only daughter escaped. The following day, I ordered to have Lv Bu beheaded, a regrettable end for such a hero. None who watched that day were unmoved. I knew Diaochan was a woman of indisputable beauty, but her resolve impressed me, when she knelt to receive her husband's head in front of all my soldiers. I may be a brave general, but I've never seen bravery like that. Come on, hurry! The mistress only has a slight cold. I don't understand what's so urgent. We can't think like that! The Chancellor's concerns must be ours! I understand. Now hurry up! Ji Ben, are you bothered that I'm doing your job? Chancellor, I'm shocked that you'd ask. Your hands are much more sensitive than mine thanks to your condition, so I'm more than willing to leave this to you. To see an old affliction become a cure, and your tender care for her, how can I not be moved? Ji Ben, let me see your tongue. It's swollen with nonsense. Mistress, you remind me of someone. You're here to examine her condition, not her face, Doctor. But, my Lord... The resemblance! It's so close! Do you mean Lv Bu's wife, Diaochan? And the voice is even more like her... Enough! The Chancellor had this deer park built for you. This is the first time he's ever done this for a woman. He's very good to you. If they don't know my heart, they can't get close enough to strike. The alignment of the four stars was closer every day, and all our fates would be revealed the instant they met. But I suddenly felt that life might be a misery and that death was the release from it. Cao Mengde may have eyes for you, but don't imagine you can make him yours. You're our master? The Han nation is sick, and it needs a cure. We can only have lasting peace when power is returned to the Emperor. In the world you're talking about, if there's no place for me and the man I love, what in heaven's name makes you think I want a damned thing to do with it? Rise! There's a secret it's time to reveal. We've waited 10 years for this day. Ten years! Cao Mengde is the man whose death will avenge your parents! You knew long ago, didn't you? If we don't know these things, life is better. Does a life like that have any meaning? Being alive itself means enough. Maybe he can tell me what life is for. I hope, from now on, we choose to live for ourselves. Mu Shun... That night, I've regretted it ever since. I didn't know if that would be the last time I saw Mu Shun. The Cao traitors plot to seize the throne, but we have His Majesty's secret orders, and the battle to exterminate the rebels is tonight! 25th year of Jian'an, Month 12, Day 15, at Bronze Sparrow Tower, I thought of the first time I met Cao Cao. I was wearing red that night too. That choice, like every other choice in my life, was made by someone else. Whom is this memorial for? My parents. What are you doing here? Are you going to war? Yes. Against who? My former subordinate, Guan Yu. I've heard he's the bravest man under heaven. General, you're not afraid that's true? If fate allows it, we'll meet again. Chancellor! The Chancellor can give you everything I can't. If that's the fate heaven has in store for me, I wish it would end this charade and make it clear. Everyone! Look! What's that? Fire! Stars in multitudes fall... Leave! Do your worst. What you want, a truly whole, peaceful life, only he can give you. So, you're the one she loves? Out! Who's here? We're here to fight the fires, open the gate! Close the door! Kill the Cao traitors! Save the Han! It's the Cao traitor! Kill him! Get the Cao traitor! Kill him! Don't let him escape! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Ji Ben, you traitor! Usurper, I carry out the will of heaven! Kill them! Attack! Why was it you? Don't look back. Let's just keep riding like this. If that's the case, you may have your freedom. I can help you, Chancellor. Give me your arm our. Allow me to lead them away. You'll die. You don't need to die for me. I'm willing to die for you. For her, I'll risk my life for you. You don't trust me. Because with all it implies, you are Cao Cao. Mu Shun said he had to attack. He had to attack this cruel world, and our cruel fate. He had to, he said, so that we'd never owe anyone again. Ling Ju... You shouldn't Kill him. You'll never understand. He already promised me he wouldn't hurt you. Don't leave me. Live on. Being alive is more important than anything. Without you, what's the point of being alive? Mu Shun was gone, and with him, the dream in his heart, and my only hope for the future. I finally understood where to find that place in his heart. The place where there was no war, no chaos, no massacre, no death. Ling Ju and Mu Shun live there. There, they have a field they plough, and clothes to wear, and sons and grandsons. And Mu Shun said as long as the hope in our hearts was alive, nothing could kill us. Attack! The Cao traitor is dead! Cao Pi, surrender! The Cao traitor is dead! The Cao traitor is dead! Rebel heretic! My father is too brave to die! Don't believe his lies! Kill every last one of them! The Cao traitor is dead! The Cao traitor is dead! Father! You all saw. He's a man, not a god. He's bleeding. Kill him. Kill him! Kill him! The Chancellor lives! Be merciful, my Lord! Ji Ben, it's time to put down your sword. Your Majesty! My sons and I did our best! No! Father! Father! Enough! I've been killing people all my life. I'm sick of death! Halt! Everyone out. -Chancellor... -Out! Chancellor, you frightened me! How did you come out of the ground like that, just... Just like... Just like... Just like a ghost? Those are your own words, Chancellor! Do you know why I built Bronze Sparrow Tower? As a monument to your achievements, Chancellor. If I only hungered for the fame and the throne, would I have waited until today? Of course! Or perhaps you were building a palace? Did Bronze Sparrow Tower's defensibility pass Your Majesty's notice? So Chancellor, was it only because you were waiting for this day? Weren't you making the same preparations 10 years ago? So you knew this day was coming? Wasn't that the same reason you gathered the children of the parents I killed, for this day? Chancellor, you've killed so many, they weren't hard to find! I killed their parents, and you killed their family line. I never imagined you'd imprison me here. You didn't really think it was just a winter hunt, did you? The reality behind what you do is hard to discern, Chancellor! I killed the Astrology Minister for his lies, that's reality. My tomb and Bronze Sparrow Tower are connected, that's reality. The defensibility of Bronze Sparrow Tower is a reality. All of it was to preserve your throne and empire. To stop the wars tearing your lands apart. Why didn't you give me that power? Without me, do you know how many "emperors" and "kings" your lands would have? My greatest curse was sharing an era with you! The only man who can truly rule is one who can sacrifice his own happiness for the submission of his people. And so we've come to today. Now Kill me, or return my empire! I've watched over you since I brought you to the capital when you were 15. If you had become a ruler who bound the nation together, like the first of your line, I would have been as loyal as Zhang Liang, yours to command. A lame, old horse can still miss the open fields, and the oldest tortoise still knows his life will end. Even though I shot the deer, it still belongs to you. I am ashamed of my wasted life, wasted because I couldn't unite these lands. I... Can't protect you any more. Sing for me, Your Majesty. Sing. Thick grow the rush leaves Their white dew turns to frost He whom I love Must be somewhere along this stream I went up the river to look for him But the way was difficult and long I went down the river to look for him and there... Trust me, I'll keep my promise to him. This is Mu Shun's sword. I recognised that pendant a long time ago. You had so many chances to kill me. If you knew who I was, why did you keep me so close? Life is shorter than you realise, over in the blink of an eye. You're still young, your heart is still pure. Come home with me, Ju. Ju, come home with me. Thick grow the rush leaves Their white dew turns to frost He whom I love Must be somewhere along this stream I went up the river to look for him But the way was difficult and long I went down the river to look for him And there in mid-water, sure enough, is he! In 220 AD, Cao Cao died in Luoyang, and was buried in Gaoling County. Eight months later, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate. The Eastern Han Dynasty ended, and Cao Pi became the second Wei emperor. He named Cao Cao the first. That year, the four stars aligned. Seal the coffin! Lift the coffin!
