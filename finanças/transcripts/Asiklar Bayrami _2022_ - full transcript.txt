NETFLIX PRESENTS Over here, please. Ready. One, two, three. Good evening. Would you accept a houseguest? Don't mention it. Come in. My shoes, they're wet, so, I wouldn't want to, uh... Never rained like this before. The whole way, a dark sky with endless rain. Is that your balcony? No, you can smoke in here. Knock yourself out. I smoke in here too. So, you're smoking too, huh? Want some water? Thank God. I came to Kırşehir to visit your mother's grave. I thought I shouldn't leave without seeing you. Well, that's good for you. After 25 years. I'm sorry to bother you this late. I won't be here for long. I'll set out for Arkanya tomorrow. What for? I have a few things to do there, and then I'll travel to Kars. Fine. Fine. I guess you're all weary from the road. I'll set up a bed for you. Get some sleep. Maybe we can talk tomorrow. Do you, by any chance, have a plastic bag or some old rags? Are you bleeding? It starts to bleed if I move too much. No, it's obvious that you're bleeding. It's nothing important. The doctor said it'd be fine in a few days. Fine, if you say so. I need to go to the courthouse first thing. I have a trial. I'll make some breakfast for you tomorrow. You could stay another day if you want. I have to go. LONE PINE TOURISM BUS TICKET DESTINATION: ARKANYA PASSENGER: ALİ ÇAKIR MEDICAL LAB TEST RESULTS REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MINISTRY OF JUSTICE - How you doing, Hülya? - Yes, partner? KIRŞEHİR COURTHOUSE I have a quick question. How busy are things? Would it be okay if I didn't show today? Absolutely. What is it? Something wrong? I just feel a little overwhelmed. I need a breather. I'm gonna take some photos, blow off a little steam. Then I'll head to Avanos. Could you email me the case file for the client in Erzurum? Then I won't have to come back on Friday and can go to Erzurum from Avanos. Got it, I'll send it right away. Salim, how are you, buddy? Thanks, Yusuf. How are you, bro? Doing the best I can. And autumn is almost upon us. How's the weather like in Van? We've been feeling the cold for a while now. Well, the reason I'm calling you is... Oh, right. Um, the test results. How does it look? Anything important? Well, the results for this patient don't look good at all. I got curious and checked him in the system. He's been to almost every hospital in the country. Recently he was admitted to the research hospital in Ankara for a week. Halfway through his treatment, he left on his own accord. I'm sorry, but I have to tell you this. The disease has spread everywhere, even to his bones. Yusuf? Yusuf, are you there, bro? Yusuf? There's nothing more that we can do? I mean, do you think it's really that serious? It is bad, bro. It really is. But you could always ask Bahri at the research hospital. Maybe he'd have something else to say. I'm in Van, so... Well, Salim, it would all be okay if I could convince my father, but he's just too damned stubborn. - Your father? - Well, it's a long story. Last night he showed up. Bro, I'm at a loss for words. I figured it was for a relative of yours. No, no, no, you really don't need to dwell on this. Thank you, Salim. Later. Later, bro. Ma'am, excuse me, excuse me. This is the Arkanya coach, right? It just left, sir. You can ask the office. - Information desk? - Inside. Excuse me. The coach for Arkanya that just left. - Could you call them back, please? - Sorry, we can't do that, sir. - How the hell are we supposed to do that? - I've no idea. You show up after 25 years, knock on my door like a goddamn houseguest, but disappear out of my life without a fucking word! What? He's supposed to go to Kars. Then go to Arkanya. Who knows what you're chasing this time. LONE PINE I need to take one of your passengers in the back. It's urgent. Just pull over. - Open the door. - Dude, what the hell? - You almost crashed into us. - I have family in there. I need to take him. Forgive me. - Seat number? - I want number 17. Come on. I'll take you to Arkanya. Come on. Come on. You don't seem well. Maybe we could go to a hospital. It's nothing too important. I'll be fine in a couple of days. You're suffering from a serious disease. I need to get you to a hospital immediately. I have doctor friends here. They'll take care of you. I'm on borrowed time. I know the treatments won't make a difference. How can you say that? All that effort and burden would be in vain, you know. Drop me off at Arkanya, would you, please? That's all I need. What are you doing in Kars? What do you have there? Before that, I'll go to Arkanya. To the Festival of Troubadours. I wanna see my friends at the Festival of Troubadours. The Festival of Troubadours? Every year, troubadours from all over the country gather there, and we play and sing folk songs and do battles. At school, we had a music teacher, Mr. Bedih. I remember him telling us about the Festival of Troubadours. He used to talk about you, always. He knew all your songs by heart. Bedih was a good singer. Are you okay? Are you in pain? There should be a gas station up ahead there. Let me wash my hands and face, and you can rest a bit if you want to. Muhammed! Where are you, kiddo? Welcome, mister. Fill it up. I hope you're well, my friend. I don't want to run out of gas on the way. I have a couple of gallons left. There's something special. - Sir. - Yes? A guy just walked past here with a bağlama in his hand. Did you see where he went? There's a graveyard around the corner. Maybe he's there. - Graveyard? Behind here? - Yeah, it is.

Well for the past 25 years, uh, you didn't even call me one time. Didn't you... you ever think about me all those years? Huh? Why? Just once. I would be okay if you just called me once. You never cared to wonder what that kid was doing, how he was doing? You were never worried about me! Well, why not? Do you know what I've been through in all those years? All those years, I waited for you while I was in boarding schools! You defied the whole world! You sang for the bugs, you sang for the mountains and plains, and you sang for your lovers, but you have nothing say now that you're here in the car with me? What did I ever do to you? Just pull over where you can, please. MOUNT MAKAM BATHHOUSE - Welcome. - Good day to you. Welcome, sir. Give him a good wash. Don't let him wear his old clothes. I'll go get some new stuff for him. Here. Certainly, partner. I'll make your dad squeaky clean. Good sir, will you come? Here, sir. MOUNT MAKAM BATHHOUSE There you go. SEMA PHOTOGRAPHY Wow, I can't believe you're Whimsy Ali. Well, forgive me, really. Please forgive me. I didn't recognize Whimsy Ali. Everyone around here sings his songs. - Here. Take the money. - It's not gonna happen. I can't do that. You earned it. Put it back into your pocket, and that's final. Feeling better, now? Thank you. - I appreciate it, my friend. - Godspeed. Godspeed. Come on. Thank you. Thank you. Godspeed. Have a safe trip. - Thanks, be safe. - Bye. Wow, man, what a surprise. I don't believe it. Not now, please. Not now. What's going on? Did the car break down? It does this from time to time. - Hello. - Yes? Yes ma'am, our car's broke down. Um, we need a tow truck. The car won't start. Yeah, what is your location? I'll just try to... So, you don't think it's gonna start, huh? It's overheated. You brought me here when I was very young. I can barely remember it now. This is the exact same spot. Where we are now. It was that summer you took me away with you for the first time. You played and sang in different villages. Then we came back here and made a stop on that lake. Do you remember that? I thought that this was an endless body of water. A vast sea. It holds less water now. Just like time itself. It is just like time, yes. Water's becoming very scarce, just like time is. And once it's depleted, you can never have it back. Uh... Are you okay? I feel nauseous. Are you all right? Here. Have some water. I guess something didn't agree with me. Here. Would you like some more? Have some more. This has never happened before. Hey, what's wrong? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not okay. We have to get you to a hospital. I'm sorry, but he's not well. We need to admit him. Hey, um, if he ends up staying here for a couple of hours, do you think we can leave after that? We'll keep the IV for a couple more hours. The nurse will be here any minute with some painkillers. I mean, he's just too exhausted. IV will be good for him. Okay, thank you, doctor. I left my instrument in the car. How about that? - Good day to you. - Thank you. How are you, mister? We'll be late for... I'll give you a shot right now, okay, and all your pain will go away. You'll be able to have a good sleep. Pardon me. I hope he feels better. Hello. Is that Yusuf? Good God, you've grown up to be a delightful man. I came as fast as I could when I got Whimsy Ali's call. Your dad's better now. The nurse just came and removed his IV. - We're waiting for you. He can leave now. - Sure. Come on. Thank you, Sergeant Bekir. - It's so good to see you. - Yeah, yes, it is. I'll take that. Thanks. EMERGENCY You should spend the night at my place. You can go back on the road first thing. Huh, maestro? I think we should do that, huh? We'll get some rest. We can go on our way first light, right? Well, Bekir, we haven't been getting much sleep lately. We'll be able to get some shut-eye. Okay. Is she alive? She is. If anyone could call that living. She's living on the streets now. Whenever we get together, she comes and listens to us from afar. Pull over at the front of that white townhouse, Yusuf. Carry on, carry on. Please don't stop. Why don't you join us? You guys hang out. I need to get some sleep. I'll rest at a hotel and come back in the morning. ♪ A room in Elaziz ♪ ♪ The moon hides behind the clouds ♪ ♪ The moon hides behind the clouds ♪ ♪ I fear death will get to me ♪ ♪ And my love will forget me ♪ YUSUF: ARE YOU STILL AT WORK?

Once, the chief of staff... ...stood right before me like this, with a serious look on his face... ...and told me that I should be a little more normal. That's weird. What did he mean by normal? Well, whatever normal is. I said, "Wait a minute. Stop right there." "This is my life, and no one has a say in it." "Am I doing my job? More than enough. So?" He froze in his tracks with that yellow envelope in his hand. The next day, boom! I had a new tattoo on the back of my neck. So, what's your story? What am I supposed to do? Should I do all the talking by myself the whole night, or, uh... I mean, I could. It wouldn't be a problem. Well, it is so good to listen to you talk. - I'm from Kırşehir. - Mm-hm. I'm 39 years old. - And I'm an attorney. - What kind of attorney? - I'm a criminal attorney. - You're a criminal attorney. Well, the reason we've met around here is my father's kinda sick... ...and I was taking him to Kars. Well, I wanna ask you something. I heard some people say that you lawyers are thieves with a briefcase. Oh, that... That's debt collectors. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, yeah. - So, you're an honest man. - They tend to grab all that they can. Usually. So, you don't do that. Well, because I'm a criminal attorney, mostly, um, it's never about money because generally, you struggle with moral issues. The clients you have taken on, um, could have very interesting stories that after a certain amount of time, it's not just their case. It becomes your case as well. I mean... We were asking what normal was? Did you kiss me to keep me from talking? No, not at all. Um, you were, like, talking about something serious, and that complexion of yours, like, complementing each other. Oh my God, I'm not making any sense. Totally. Your dad, God willing he gets better. He'll be fine. Forgive me. Ah, please don't cry. I came to see you one last time. Forgive me. I don't have much time left. I ask you for forgiveness. ♪ I fell in love with three beauties ♪ ♪ The sun, the moon, and the one ♪ ♪ I lost myself in their love ♪ ♪ The sun, the moon, and the one ♪ ♪ The moon, and the one ♪ ♪ Oh my, oh my ♪ ♪ I lost myself in their love ♪ ♪ Which one should my heart... ♪ Ah... Forgive me for everything. We should have a picture together. Huh? W... would you lift your head up a little? Here you go. Thank you. Do you think there is justice in the world? In this world, or the other one? Both, actually. I've lived long enough to see that there's none in this world. And I'm doubtful about the other one, actually. Right. If there's really justice, do you think you and I would live the same story all by ourselves? You and I in different places. All this is how it ends. You were so young when your mother and I parted ways. When I was seven, my dad bought me one of those hats like the ones the watchmen used to wear. There was a boarding school in town. He was gonna send me there, you know. He wanted me to be a teacher. That was the year my father passed away. And I, with my hat my dad gave me in my hand, and his lute, was left stranded. And not even two years after that, my mother was gone. Don't change the subject. Look. This is not about you. This is about how you left both of us. And then after you left us, my mother got remarried to that guy. Twenty-five goddamn years! Twenty-five goddamn years. Couldn't you even call me once? Didn't you ever worry about your son? Am I not your son, dammit? You dropped me into the middle of the world and didn't even bother to ask me how I was doing? I thought you'd be better off if I stayed away from you. I never thought that your mother would marry someone else. Though she did the right thing. Can't be easy living as a young widow in a village. Well, so? Okay. Mom was right, you were right, and it is what it is? Huh? Is that all it is for you? I... Man, just stop talking. Stop it! Shut up. He's not responding, Shut up! Shut up! You motherfucker! You fucked up my life! You left me! You pierced through me! Every single weekend, I waited for you at those fucking boarding schools! Yusuf! Yusuf! Yusuf! Yusuf. Were you having a bad dream? You're all sweaty. Listen. I have something to tell you, but I don't want you to get offended. All right? Behind those hills is a friend's home. I'll sleep at his place tonight, okay? And I'll leave for Kars before the break of dawn tomorrow. What's wrong? Are you very upset with me? I'm not upset with you at all, dear Yusuf. Thank you. Well, you don't need to wait. You'll get cold with just that shirt on your back. Like you were worried about me for all those years. Wow. Whimsy Ali is here. My master is here. Hello, old friend. - Welcome. - Thank you, brother. You are most welcome. It's good to have you here. I wanted to see you one last time. That is so kind of you. Come. - Hello. - Hello. - How have you been? - I'm fine. How are you? - Better now. - Good to see you. Look, this is called zerefet. And that is Hızır's pie. You're going to love them both very much. Let's eat, then. Enjoy. Naturally, ours is the way of acceptance. If any of you have resentments among each other, step into the circle of God or say, "God, hallelujah." God, hallelujah. Do you willingly absolve each other? I do. - Do you absolve each other? - I do. If you absolve them, silence your tongue, for good moral values is the sign of a true believer. ♪ In the name of Ali, Allah Allah ♪ ♪ O', Allah, O', I bow ♪ ♪ Prayer is the duty of men ♪ ♪ We spectate in this realm ♪ ♪ Hand in hand, we became one with God ♪ ♪ And to this moment we've all arrived ♪ ♪ Sacrifices were made Prayers were chanted ♪ ♪ I awakened, my mind was clear ♪ ♪ Before me The Four Doors suddenly opened ♪ ♪ In my bare skin, I am now here ♪ ♪ In my bare skin, I am now here ♪ ♪ On the threshold, I set my heart ♪ ♪ I set my heart ♪ ♪ In tearful bliss, I was embraced ♪ ♪ On the path of saints, see me fight ♪ ♪ I am devoted to this path I am now here ♪ ♪ I am devoted to this path I am now here... ♪ ♪ The Prince of Heroes emerged ♪ ♪ On his steed Duldul, he rode forth ♪ ♪ The oppressed were pushed too far ♪ ♪ Ali unsheathed Zulfiqar ♪ ♪ Ali unsheathed Zulfiqar ♪ ♪ Then there was Haji Bektash Veli ♪ ♪ He was beloved, just like Ali ♪ Take me there, Mamos. - There? - Yeah.

Whimsy Ali wrote a bunch of songs for her. Under that tree, he played and Zere played back. And then? Then Whimsy Ali stopped visiting this village for a very long time. Months and seasons passed by. Zere never stopped waiting for him. Finally, one day, when Whimsy Ali appeared on the path to the village, Zere's heart started racing like crazy. Just then, Whimsy Ali, he started to sing his new and very beautiful, but sad song of his. It was in that moment, when Zere was quick enough to understand the song wasn't written for her, but for another woman. The song was about a woman with blonde hair and tightly tied braids. And Zere has red hair like henna. Zere rose gently from her spot, turned around, and walked home in the dead of silence.

Take good care of him, huh? Your father is not well. Don't be upset with him, all right? Whatever happened, it's all in the past. And we all had stories of our own. And this is just who he is. But God knows, he was never a foul kind of man. That heart of his has beaten from inside his instrument. And I kept all the poison inside of me. And although he's not healthy enough to do that, still he shows up at my door for forgiveness. What would you do? You'll let us know if something bad happens to him, won't you? Won't you? Did you have a good night's sleep? Yeah, it was great. I haven't slept that well for a very long time. - Great. - Just like when I was a kid. Hmm. You? Do the hungry or the lovers ever truly sleep? - What? Do the hungry... - Or the lovers... - Or the lovers ever sleep? - Uh-huh. Wow, nice saying. IDs. Hello. I'm a lawyer. I don't care, bro. What's your destination? Um, my dad and I, we're on our way to Kars. Step out and open the trunk, will you? Open that luggage. - This one? - Yes. What's that? A shroud? What's that, bro? You're travelling with grave clothes? Okay, you can close it. - Move along, bro, move along. - Thank you. Salaam alaikum, troubadours. Alaikum salaam. - Welcome. - Good to see you. - My master's here. - Yakup. My master's here. Alaikum salaam, master. - Alaikum salaam. - My friend. Master, what's happened to you, huh? You look so withered. - Have a seat, come on. Come. - Thank you. Come. My boy. Come, have a seat. Have some tea. Thank you, sir. Maybe next time. I need to go see a client of mine up at the penitentiary. Um... Whimsy Ali is not feeling well. Just please call me in case something happens to him, all right? All right. Don't worry about him, my boy. Just go about your business. - Have a good one. - Thanks. Troubadour.

Come on. - I hope he gets better, brother. - Thank you. Thank you. - Who's the next of kin? - I am. The patient is unconscious. And his vitals don't look good. I guess you're aware of his condition. Right now, he's hooked up on a respirator. We just have to wait and see. But can I see him now? No, I'm afraid I can't allow that at the moment. Maybe later. You don't have to wait here. We'll let you know if anything happens. Don't exhaust yourself. SOUVENIR FROM ARKANYA Over here, please. One, two, three! Well, thank you for this, troubadours. Let's go outside. - Good day, brother. - God willing. Get well soon. God bless him. Inshallah. See? He opened his eyes as soon as we started playing his favorite folk song. Yusuf. Don't exhaust yourself. Close your eyes and get some rest. Don't be afraid, son. Good evening. Salim? You didn't have to come all the way over here from Van. Don't mention it. It's nothing. I wasn't gonna leave you alone in this situation. Maybe I can be of use here. Hello, sir. Things don't look good, bro. You... should be ready for anything. When you find him after all these years, you... you wish you had a few more days. Lie down, lie down, lie down. - Wait, wait, wait. - Lie down, master. What? - You want me to play you some bağlama? - No. You want to go to Kars? Uh-huh. Kars. You think we can arrange something? Bro, well... Kars is only a three-hour drive, but it's likely that we'll lose him on the way. This is not what you do with a patient at this stage. Well, I know that. The only thing he wants is to go to that festival and say goodbye to his friends. So, I need you to find me a private ambulance. Please. Okay, fine. It's not the wisest thing to do, but let's try. Thank you. THE FESTIVAL OF TROUBADOURS He's not doing well. He threw up a few times on the way here. Saturation is decreasing constantly. Do I have your blessings, friends? - You do! - Thank you. Yusuf? We need to go to a hospital. Thank you. God bless you. Hang in there. We're on our way to the hospital. Just hang in there. I'm here. Don't worry. My dad. My boy? Don't exhaust yourself.
