Do you like me? No. You know what? I don't need some stupid mongrel that just stuffs itself and craps. I get the fact that the size of his turds is something to be proud of. Leave them on the pavement so that everyone can admire them. But roundworms and tapeworms don't fall within the circle of my interests. If you think that this is the way to win me round And that I'll start calling you Daddy, Daddykins! Daddypoohs! Fucker! Cocksucker! Where's the salt? In the shop. You don't have to call me "Dad". Need anything? Yeah. Coke. My friends threw a birthday party for me. They quite simply couldn't come the other day. They apologized. Threw another party for me. There were loads of guests. Loads. We had cake and ice cream. Frutti di Bosco. Minus the Frutti... (singer singing in foreign language) (phone buzzing) Dog! Dog. Dog! (dog whimpering) Open it. (dog barking and growling) Run some water into the bowl. What're you doing? Open it. Pour it over the wound. Grab him by the muzzle. Stroke him. Easy, little dog, easy. If you win the European Physical Society award, you can keep him. Give me that. Give it to me. (dryer blowing) 42. The distance between the centre of a button And the centre of the buttonhole On the other side of the collar. Are you coming tomorrow? - [Computer] Three days until the end of the world. (soft music) There's a garden and a big house. Dogs guarding the garden, the house. There's a boy who'd like to have a dog. And a promise that he'll get one. The bitch is going to have a litter. It's a question of waiting. Waiting. The boy watches. He chooses. One that smells like a little dog-? With soft fur. They feed him farina, fix up a bed for him. Cuddle him, clean up his wee. They've got a dog. They take him for walks. The father comes. The mother doesn't. The dog gets bigger and stronger. Tears up the cardboard box he lives in. There's not enough space. He needs a garden. A large one. The dog doesn't like it when people come home or when they go out. The dog has sharp teeth, But the father's word is law. The father sees to that. The father makes sure of it. The dog understands a lot. It's obvious from his eyes. Moist eyes. Maybe the games with the water from the cold well. Or maybe that's just the way he is. The limp gets worse and worse. The dog just lies there. The dog limps. One of his back paws. Maybe the result of a game. The mother brings him food. The father wants to help, To carry him somewhere, wash him, move him, because he's in the way. He blocks the hall. Has to be stepped over. Shifted. Won't let the father come near him. Won't allow it. The dog snarls at the father. Bares his teeth and snarls. The dog can't get up, so the boy kinds of gets down, The boy likes getting close to him when he's lying there like that, tired. He snuggles up to him. Kind of crouches and kind of kisses him. And the dog loves that. The boy strokes the dog's head softly. Softly. And everything goes so quiet. Silent. The mother finds a phone number, where anything can be dealt with. She phones. They take him away. Take him. He's gone. Not buried anywhere. There's no body. Nobody wanted to collect the remains. The boy doesn't know. He doesn't know. He knows. The dog disappeared. Simply disappeared. Let's go for a swim. (water splashing) (wind howling) (men panting) - Did you see? - What? - Did you see? - No. So open your eyes now. (dramatic music) (high whistling) - [Computer] Two days until the end of the world. (hammering) (dramatic music) (dog barking) Stay. Stay! Will you cut my hair? Go and get the trimmer. (razor buzzing) "Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there? My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly care My daughters by night their glad festival keep, They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep." - [Computer] One day until the end of the world. (audience applauding) (audience murmuring) - The ice is the body. (steam hissing) Vapor is the awareness. The physical disintegration of the body is not the end of consciousness. Consciousness exists beyond time and space. It is unattached to the body, a quantum object unconnected to anybody's. In three dimensional space, the ultimate power Don't be so nervous. Determining direction in which a given quantum System will head. So, it is enough to change one's state of concentration And to move into another dimension. It is that which is the link between worlds. After death, the consciousness passes, neither to hell Nor to heaven but to another world. Thank you. Goodbye. (crowd murmuring) - I've finished. - No. No, you haven't. - Get back there. - No. We had a deal. Did we or didn't we? You wanted the dog? You got the dog. I agreed. I trusted you. Did you go off on that trip? I didn't phone, not once. I didn't ask a single question. - Get back there. - No. I'll hand that dog over to the animal rescue. I'll dump that lousy, stinking mongrel at the rescue, understand? I hate you. (classical music) Go and wait in the car. Go. Please. Go away. I'm going. What are you doing? I'm taking the tunnel. Fuck off! I don't even want to see your face! See. Feel. It's only a competition. Another expanse, time. Another space. You're not going to tell me how to bring up my son. He's my child. Child. Fuck off! I know perfectly well what he needs. What? Does a child going back... Going back through the tunnel... Does he return? Does he return to where he came from? He doesn't want to.
