Gacy Sr.: Got a little delay on it. Whoosh... better. Lay... lay it back there for awhile. Lay it back and then let it go. All right, show me... yeah. John: Like that? Gacy Sr.: Yeah. You wanna have more of a crack on the end of that whip. Wha-chuuu! Wha-chuuu! Wha-chuuu! You have to delay it before you release it. Okay? That's the thing you gotta remember. You have to lay it go after your hand goes. And then you can get the whipping action. Just a little bit more of a delay. ( sighing ) You can't beat the wonders of nature, son. Gotta breath in that fresh air. Deep. Get that dirty city air out of your lungs. ( inhaling ) ( exhaling ) Can't beat it. ( John inhaling ) ( John exhaling ) Gacy Sr.: You know what your problem is? You spend too much time locked up in that room of yours. You gotta get out more. That's good for the soul. Boy, we are gonna have us some supper tonight. Ahh... Why do you hate fishin', boy? John: I don't hate fishin', Dad. Gacy Sr.: Yeah, you do. Fidget, daydream. You fuck up. Ow! I almost lost this one. It's dinner. ( John laughing ) Gacy Sr.: You find that funny? John: Dad, look, I... Gacy Sr.: Show me what you got... Fuck! Go ahead, hit me, jag-off. You can't do it, can you, jag-off, huh? ( laughing ) You can't. Get off of me. Get your fat ass to bed. ( John crying ) ( doorbell ringing ) John: Hi, Meg, we're right in the middle of lunch. Meg: John, I'm sorry to disturb you, but that hideous stench coming from under your house is getting worse. John: It's moisture build-up in the my crawlspace. I'm taking care of it, I promise, now don't forget the 4th of July, right? Meg: What about it? John: It's my annual garden party. It's costume, western style. Meg: Yeah, yeah, oh... I'll tell Fred. John: There you go, Mother. A nice piece of white meat, just the way you like it. Mother Gacy: Thank you, Johnny. ( tires screeching ) Mmm, delicious. ( doorbell ringing ) John: Jesus Christ! ( knocking ) Stevie: I want my money, man. John: Stevie, I told you on Friday... you know that. Stevie: Fuck what you said on Friday. You owe me for two weeks and I need it now. I want my fuckin' money, John! Mother Gacy: Language, please. There are children here. John: That's all right, Mom, I'm gonna take care of it right now. Stevie: What? John: Move on out of here, come on. I don't want that kind of language in front of my mother. Stevie: Look, man, you better give me my money or I'm gonna report you for not deducting the taxes from my earnings. That's against the law. John: Who told you that? Stevie: My dad. Look, you better pay up, or me and pal's gonna kick your ass. John: Stevie! You don't wanna do that. Did I tell you I got a bad heart? You wanna risk killin' me over a lousy paycheck? Stevie: I know. Look, man, I'm desperate. John: Stevie, I promise I'm gonna take care of you this week. Stevie: That's what you said last week. John: You have my word on it. ( laughing ) ( laughing continues ) ( laughing ) girls: ( screaming ) girl: Mommy, Mommy! Bugs! Karen: John! Come on, let's go, go. John: I'll handle it. ( spraying ) ( coughing ) man: You're listening to WSAU, the hottest radio station in Downtown Chicago. Well, it's time for a WSAU... ( siren blaring in distance ) ( dog barking in distance ) ( bird squawking ) ( country music playing ) John: Well, I recognize that face anywhere. Hal: John! You lazy fat... John: ( growling ) Hey. Hal: How the fuck are ya? John: You big Pollock! Got a question for ya. Hal: Shoot. John: Quick question. What do I do for stink comin' from a crawlspace? Hal: Could you be a tad more specific, John? John: Well, it smells like shit. I mean bad shit. Hal: I bet you got a leaking sewage pipe... that's not good. John: I know that, but what do I do about it? Everybody's complaining. The neighbors, the wife. Oh, goddamn, especially the wife. Hal: Guess the best thing to do for seepage is lay down lime. Just keep layin' it down. John: Lime? Why the fuck didn't I think of that? Hal: Listen, I'm not busy now, I could come over now and take a looksee. John: No, no, no, I... No, uh... Hal: How about this afternoon? John: I can't do it today, but thanks anyway. Look, I wanna see you at my 4th of July bash, right? Hal: Wouldn't miss it for the world, John. John: Thanks, buddy, see ya later. Hal: Hey, John. Go fuck yourself. ( John laughing ) Hal: Ha. Peter: I'll see you tomorrow, right? Cool. John: Jack Handley, Chicago PD. You're under arrest. Peter: For what? Hey, what the... For what? I didn't do anything. John: Against there. You know what for. Peter: I didn't do anything. John: Put your hands behind your back and shut up! Peter: Easy. One day he just hit me for the last time. I just fuckin' split. You know, I got on a bus, I come to Chicago. And I figure I get a job or somethin', you know? I ran out of money, you know. That's why you found me where you found me. John: You know, Peter... you're a lucky guy. Peter: What do you mean? John: You still have your father. You still have the hope of reconciliation. I ain't got that. Peter: I'm sorry. John: Okay, kid. Let's get out of here. ( tires screeching ) Peter: All right. Goodbye, Detective Handley. John: Peter. This is for the bus, okay? Peter: Thanks, man. Boy: One more little hit. Stevie: One more little hit? Take another, take another. Come on, man, the job will be so much better. Boy: Go, go, go, go. Stevie: I haven't even had my second hit yet. Boy: What've you been doing? John: Oh, God. Boy: Nice joint. Stevie: Here comes the colonel. Hey. Give me a broom or something. Thank you. John: Jesus H. Christ! How many times I gotta tell you jag-offs not to smoke that shit on the job? Boy: Huh? John: Do you hear me?! Boy: Well, personally speaking, it improves my work. I, like, really get into it. ( laughing ) John: Yeah, but it takes you all friggin' day. I'm confiscating this, douche bag. Come here... come here. So, uh, how do you like workin' with John Wayne Gacy? Stu: Yeah, it's cool. I like it. Say, is that your real name, John Wayne? John: Sure is. Tell me, Stu, do you wrestle? Stu: Huh? ( John laughing ) Stu: Oooh. ( both laughing ) Stevie: Faggot. John: You are way out of line. Way out of line! One more word outta you and I'll kill your ass. You know, I need two of you to go with me and pick up some bags of lime. Stu, Dave, follow me. ( tires screeching ) ( rock music blaring ) ( horn honking ) Stevie: Ready to rock-and-roll? Man: Right on! ( rock music blaring ) ( tires screeching ) Stevie: Okay, fat ass, time to cough it up. John: You little piece of shit. Hey, hey, take it easy. Jesus Christ. I got a bad ticker. If I keel over in this parking lot from a heart attack, you're goin' to jail. You wanna go to jail? Huh, you wanna go to jail? Stevie: He's lying. He's a lying fuckin' sack of faggot shit! Come here. It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. John Wayne Gacy. John: You little prick! Stevie: And by the way, I quit. It's been... John: You don't know who you're dealing with, you little punk. I'm connected. ( Stevie laughing ) I'm with the syndicate. I can have you rubbed out like that, asshole. Like that! ( engine rattling ) ( clattering ) Mother Gacy: What's that? What's that? What is it? John? Karen: John? John? ( door creaking ) ( door creaking ) ( gasping ) Oh! John: Karen. Hi. Karen: What are you doing down there? John: Laying down some lime. You're always bitchin' about the goddamn smell, so I'm doin' somethin' about it. Karen: It's 3:15 in the morning. John: And? Smell don't sleep. Karen: Oh... man: You want another bloody one? This is fallin' apart. Burgers suck. John: Ted. Ted: Hi, John. John: Julie. Thank you for coming. Ted: Karen, always a pleasure. Hey, I'm sorry, but we didn't know it was a costume party. John: Hey, everybody, listen up here. This is our alderman, Mr. Ted Doyle and his lovely wife, Julie. Ted: Good people, you are truly fortunate to have, as a friend and colleague, John Wayne Gacy. A good man, a great Democrat, and... who knows... maybe even the next precinct captain. Man: Yeah. Ted: Let me tell you a little about this man. If it wasn't for John Wayne Gacy, none of the street lights in this town would have a number on them. You have John to thank for that. He is a real inspiration and role model to children. And as far as I'm concerned, a living embodiment of the American dream. ( man whistling ) Thank you. Excuse me. John: That was great. Ted: John, I'm afraid that Bob can't make it. He sends his apologies and he said keep up the good work. I also hear those poor kids really appreciate your visits as Pongo the Clown. John: Uh, Pogo. Ted: Oh, right, right, Pogo. Gretchen: Wow. Look at all the squares. Tom: Hey. Man: I didn't think you're gonna make it. Come on down. You guys wanna go over to the bar and get a drink? Tom: Yeah. Hal: John, John, John... Let's go take a looksee at the crawlspace of yours. John: Not now, Hal, this is a party. Hal: You got me here now, let's go now. Karen: Oh, Hal, would you? That would be so great. Hal: Come on, let's go. ( coughing ) ( coughing ) Jeez. ( gagging ) Yeah, I've smelled worse but not much. Could be a sewage pipe leak but I don't know. Doesn't really smell of effluent. I can't put my finger on it. John: So what should I do? Hal: Keep layin' down the lime. John: I have been. Hal: You know, John, with your clout at city hall, you could get this pipe seen to in a jiffy. John: And if the lime doesn't work? Hal: Guess you'll have to concrete the whole damn thing. And those bugs... You should call Eddie Bloom. Best exterminator in town. ( rock music playing ) John: I'll take that. Boy: What happened to Stevie? John: That loser. I paid him off. Said he was goin' to Costa Rica. Boy: Costa Rica? John: Uh-huh. Boy: What are we gonna do on the Grysinski job? We'll be a man short. John: Leave that to me. John Gacy. Tom: Tom Kovak. This is Gretchen. John: You're one of Steve's friends, huh? Tom: Yeah. John: Lookin' for work? Tom: I am. John: You know what we do? Tom: Yeah. John: Show up tomorrow morning. Tom: Deal. John: Good. Man: I can never figure out why he uses those young, dumb kids. Ray: Can't ya? Gretchen: ( moaning ) You do still love me, don't you? Tom: Totally. Gretchen: Then what's the problem? I mean, how else are you gonna get that kind of money, rob a bank? Look, okay, the guy creeps me out too, but you're a big boy now. You can take care of that fag. ( birds chirping ) Fred: ( gagging ) Shit! John: Fred? Fred: That pipe is pumping fucking noxious fluid into my... It's polluting my garden! And those bugs, they are as big as fuckin' rabbits. John: I'm gonna take care of it. Fred: You are like a stuck record. I am gonna sue your fucking ass, porky. You asshole! John: Jesus... ( tires screeching ) ( doorbell ringing ) Eddie: Mr. Gacy? John: Yeah. Eddie: Eddie Bloom, vermin control. We spoke. John: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on in. Eddie: I hear you have a little problem. John: Sure do. ( door creaking ) Eddie: Stop, don't turn on the light. Gonna surprise 'em. ( bugs buzzing ) Holy shit! ( hissing ) I'm chargin' him double for this. Bucholtz: Are you John Gacy? John: Sure am. Bucholtz: I'm Officer Bucholtz, this is Officer Wolf. John: What can I do for you officers? Bucholtz: We're investing the disappearance of an employee of yours, a Steven Banasky. Disappeared about two months ago. John: Yeah, that's Stevie. He used to work for me. I paid him off, uh, about two months ago. Said somethin' about takin' off to Costa Rica. Bucholtz: Costa Rica, huh? Wolf: Do you smell that?? John: Or was it, uh, Puerto Rico? No, no, no, no, I'm sure. It was Costa Rica. Bucholtz: Well, if he shows up, I'd be obliged if you give us a call. John: Sure thing, Officer Bucholtz. Wolf: Thanks a lot for your time. John: Oh, no problem. Oh, say hi to Captain Harris for me. Bucholtz: Will do. Wolf: Do you smell that? Bucholtz: Get in the car! Dave: Those guys cops? John: Yes, Dave, they were. Now will get a move on? Dave: What they want? John: They're lookin' for somebody, okay? John: Oh, Jesus Christ, fuck, not again. Hey, Dave. The fuses are under the bench here, buddy. You mind? Dave: Jeez, I can't see shit. You got... Yeah. Gacy Sr.: Go ahead, hit me, jag-off. Go ahead, hit me, hit me. ( laughing ) You can't do it, can ya? You can't. Dave: ( screaming ) No! John: Dave. ( Dave screaming ) Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave. Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all right? Dave: I don't know. My head hurts so bad. ( screaming ) John: Shh, shh, shh, shh... ( Dave screaming ) Shh, shh, shh... Hang on, hang on... Let me look, let me look. Dave, Dave, Dave, let me look. Okay. Oh, I'm so sorry, Dave. If you tell anybody about this, I'll tell 'em about us. Do I have to spell it out for ya? Dave: That's okay. John: Wait, wait. Dave. Shh, okay. Shh, shh, please. And don't be late tomorrow. Man: After one year in office, Jimmy Carter has proven to be a moral presence in the White House, but is that enough? We'll be discussing that today with our distinguished panel of journalists from TV and print. First of all, from. "Chicago Sun Times," we have... John: Hi, honey. Happy Mother's Day! Karen: Why didn't you just tell me that you liked boys? John: I don't, Karen. I swear I don't. You know how much I hate homos. It's just that... I don't know, I... I might be, maybe... Karen: You think I was born yesterday? I don't know how many times I've seen you come and go with those young... guys in the garage. God only knows what you're doin' in there. I'm gonna burn down that fucking garage, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna burn it to the fucking ground. John: Karen! You know how hard I been workin', trying to build this business? I mean, I'm not out there... drinkin' and gamblin' and doin' drugs, bangin' every other broad in town. I'm out there bustin' my balls for you and the girls. And what I do in that garage is all business-related. Karen: Oh, yeah. What do you use these for? You jag-off! John: I told you... ...never to call me that. ( Karen crying ) ( engine revving ) ( John panting ) ( bugs buzzing ) John: Gonna pay off the building inspector for violations of which there were many. Jesus Christ, let's go to the van. Hey... why the long face? You need to talk to somebody? Tom: I'm havin' some problems, that's all. John: That, uh, that girl? Tom: No, it's my parents. John: Listen, Tom, I want you to keep this in mind when you're trying to understand them. Your parents love you and only want to see you happy. Tom: Thanks, John. Just my dad's such a fuckin' asshole, we just bitch and fight all the time. You know what I mean? John: Uh-huh. Tom: He's trying to force me to go to college, doesn't give a fuck about what I wanna do. I gotta get out. John: Hey, you know, I just had a great idea. I got a spare room. I can let you have it for, say, 25 bucks a week. You can rent it until you figure out what it is you wanna do. It would be awfully convenient. I mean, we work together, for Christ's sake. Think about it. Just think about it. Tom: Yeah, it's gonna be pretty cool havin' my own pool table. Man: What? You buyin' this thing off John? Tom: No, John offered me a room. I'm thinkin' of takin' it. Man: Cool. Dave: You sure that's such a good idea? Tom: Why not? Rent's cheap. Dave: You never heard the one about mixin' business with pleasure? Tom: Fuck that. Me and my folks are at meltdown. John's savin' my ass. Dave: You know what John's like at work. I mean, imagine what he's like at night. You know, when he's alone. Man: You drop your keys, you better remember to kick 'em. Tom: I can handle John. Dave: Tom, I really don't think it's a good idea. Tom... Tom: What's your problem, Dave? Come on, spit it out. Dave: Tom, look, I... Man: I think maybe he's jealous, Tom. Dave: Fuck you guys. Ted: So she pulls down her pants. She sits on Pinocchio's face and says, "Ooh, tell me lies. Tell me lies." ( all laughing ) Hal: What a guy. John: I'm gonna go water the horse. Ted: Don't stick me with the bill. I don't have any money. Hal: Hey, Ted, did you just drop one? Ted: Ho, ho, ho, that was you, you jag-off. It smells worse than. Gacy's house. ( all laughing ) John: Ray, I need to ask a favor. How much would it cost to lay a load of concrete on top of the earth in my crawlspace? What the fuck? Ray: I ain't gonna do you anymore fuckin' favors 'til you pay me the money that you owe me, do you hear me? John: Let go of me, Ray, I'm pissin' down my leg here. Ray: I don't fuckin' care. Where's my money? John: I'll pay you this week. Ted: Hey, guys, come on. Take it easy. We're all supposed to be pals here. Ray: Gacy... you're a fuckin' liar. Ted: What was that all about? John: Nothin'. John: Wanna get high? Roger: You a cop? John: ( sighing ) Even cops get horny. ( engine revving ) What's your name? Roger: Roger. John: I got somethin' for you, Roger. ( Roger gagging ) ( tires screeching ) John: You lookin' for me? Roger: Oh! John: Have a drink! ( Roger gagging ) John: Good, huh? Roger: Why don't you just get it over with? John: You need to show some respect, girl. I'm the one who's gonna teach it to you. ( Roger gagging ) ( dog barking in distance ) Tom: I can't wait until we can do it in a big soft bed. Gretchen: Uh-huh. Tom: Nice crisp white cotton sheets. Rubber. Gretchen: Oh... ( zipper unzipping ) Tom: Just think, baby, when I move in with Gacy, I'll be able to lay you down... Gretchen: What? Gacy. You're thinkin' of moving in with John Gacy? Tom: Well, I can't stay at home, can I? ( Roger coughing ) ( tires screeching ) ( doorbell ringing ) Tom: Oh... John: Hey, Tom. ( exhaling ) I'm just laying down some lime. Wanna strap on the rubber and come help? Tom: Uh... John: I'm just kiddin'. Lighten up. Come on, let's go smoke a bowl. Are you sure you don't wanna call your parents and let 'em know you're okay? I mean, they must be worried sick. Tom: Fuck 'em. John: ( laughing ) Okay. Let's show you to your room. Mom's room's on the left here. She's in Arkansas, she'll be back in about three weeks. I'm givin' you the girls' room. You're gonna have to fix it up a little bit. It'll turn out okay. Listen, I need to get back to work. Tom: Yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and crash anyway. John: So early? Tom: See you in the mornin'. ( chains rattling ) Gretchen: No, wait, no. Go and get some... get something. Tom: Oh, shit, all right. Gretchen: And get me some ice cream. Please. Thank you. ( engine revving ) John: Where's Tom? Gretchen: He's at the drug store. John: It's Gretchen, right? Well, you know, Gretchen, I have a strict "no girls in the house" policy. And I believe you fall in that category. Gretchen: That's ridiculous. He pays rent, he can have a... John: No, there's no negotiating. Now get your stuff and get your butt out. Gretchen: No. I'll go when Tom gets back. John: What's the matter, never seen a clown before? Jimmy: I, uh... Uh, I'm Jimmy Burrel. We spoke before, you said you might wanna buy my car. John: Oh yeah, right. Uh, let's take a look. Jimmy: Sure. John: Take it for a spin? Jimmy: Sure. John: I like it. Okay, you've got yourself a deal. Money's in the house. Let's have a drink. Jimmy: Sure. ( gagging ) John: You love it, huh? ( Jimmy screaming ) ( Jimmy screaming ) ( Jimmy wheezing ) ( phone ringing ) John: Ma! ( Jimmy gasping ) Ma! Shit. Woman: Tommy? John: I'm sorry. Now... Ah, shit. Shit! ( Mother Gacy snoring ) John: Nice little Chevy. Stu: Cool. How much? John: 400 bucks. Stu: I like it. Only got two. John: We'll make it 350. Stu: All right. John: There you go, my friend. Stu: Say, who is this guy anyway? John: Oh, he's a friend of mine. He needs to get out of town quick. Splittin' to LA. Bring one of the guys by in the morning. I need you to dig a trench in my crawl space to lay some pipes. Stu: Sure thing, boss. ( Mother Gacy snoring ) ( rattling ) ( bugs buzzing ) Tom: Oh, I... I heard a weird sound. John: Just the sump pump. Pumpin' out the gunk. Tom: No, not that. It's a strange whining noise. John: Maggots. Tom: Huh? John: Whining maggots. It's the sound of a million maggots writhing in aluminum. Come on now, will you go to bed? We got a big day tomorrow. John: Come on. I want you guys to dig between the sticks. Only dig... between the sticks, okay? Come on, come on, go. Go, and, look, look, about two foot down, that's it. I need to get some pipes in there.

Kay: Are you sure, Mr. Gacy? John: Positive. Lt. Kay: It's just that you were on a list of possible buyers of his car and I... John: Look, pal, I just told you I've never seen that kid before in my life. Now can I get on with my day? Lt. Kay: Thanks for your help. Excuse me. Excuse me, sorry to bother you folks.
