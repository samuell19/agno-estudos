A TOR Film Unit production A WOMAN IN A HAT Starring as Eva Co-starring With Production designer Interior decoration Sound Editing Music Costumes Make-up Assistant to director Assistants to production manager Production manager Director of Photography Written and Directed by Lovely! Come on, child, smile. What's your name? Eva. Eva... Lovely! Hold still! Want some veaI? - No thank you. - Liver? - No. - Excuse me. Eva! Come in. There, take a seat. - A drink? - No, thank you. I'm glad to see you. It's been a long time. Here. I know you like good tea. How kind of you, child. Going to such expense. I drink less tea these days. - But you're keeping well? - I do my best. And you? Working a lot? Scarcely. Mainly walk-ons. That's the stage. You spend years waiting for a role. Then along it comes and the world's at your feet. At seventy I said, enough is enough. Time to stop parading this tired old flesh. You were terrific in THE HOUSE OF BERNARDO ALBA. I saw you five times in it. The way you spoke that line... ...Everything is very dark... My child... will have fair hair... ...and his own child. And we shall all have hair as white as snow. And we will be like waves rippling on to the shore. I loved the part of Maria Jose. I was cast once... as Ophelia, but the man playing Hamlet said: "I can't perform with her". He never explained why. So many roles I wanted to play... ...and could play, have passed me by. When I was your age, stage was my whole life. I never settled down, never had children... Men - yes. - Got a visitor? - This is Eva, my student. Maria Zielinska, a friend of Zofia. Are you also an actress? I got this in exchange for old newspapers. We never throw away any. This month we can get groats on the ration. I had a flash as I was passing the butcher. I popped inside. And look what I got! Hot dogs! I'll make you some noodles, to warm up. I may be tied up tomorrow. You know what the shops are like nowadays... I still tour. I know how things are outside Warsaw. One small town, we tried to get a meaI. The waiter recommended something called bisonette. Know what that is? A cross between a cow and a bison. At 600 zlotys a plate! I ask you! Well, I'II leave you to get on with your chat. I'll put the borscht on. Borscht, borscht, borscht... She's a little eccentric... ... but salt of the earth. She helps me a lot. Drops by regularly. She has a kind heart. Professor, I know one shouldn't ask questions like this but the fact is, I've done absolutely nothing... Maybe I ought to call it a day? I think I'm resilient enough to quit... ...even though the theater is what I love the most. I could find some other job. You've peeped behind that curtain... But if there's only illusion there... How long can you wait? You know all the answers. I may have known once, but not now. I know less and less, my dear. One thing I can tell you: If I had to choose again I'd choose the stage. And today? I'm more and more intrigued by what lies behind... ...the curtain separating life from the unknown. The borscht's almost ready! I forgot to tell you. I visited the Home. Laskowski sends you his love. He claimed he was the best pre-war Hamlet. He never even played Hamlet. He's getting ga-ga. One of the maids slapped him. He stuck his hand up her skirt, the old goat! He's even made some improper suggestions towards me.... What age does to people! But the gardens are lovely... Miss Eva! I have to talk to you. About Zosia. She's very sick. No one can say how long... A few months perhaps, maybe only weeks. Her heart's weak. But she refuses to go into hospitaI... or move to the Home. So, please, drop by now and then, dear child. I worked out a fit of hiccups for Act III. I went on, spoke my lines and hiccupped! On the opening night that bitch goes on... ...and starts hiccupping in Act I! Though it was more like burping. But a rip-off. Not the first time either, I once thought up a naiI biting business. On the fourth night there she was... ... biting her nails! These have been darned. We've run out of new ones. And why the hell the gloves are dirty?! Female Mannequins and Executioner, on stage please! What are you doing here? Get along with you! Having heard the evidence the court... ...sentences the prisoner also known as the Leader... - ... to execution by beheading. - What? No like? No. Why? Look in the mirror. Well? Not bad. Lewicki's coming tomorrow. He wants to see you. Get off me! It's a plot! The electrician is requested to report in. They've stolen my head! Where's my head? Where's my ministeriaI head? The ball goes on. Hi, Felix. No, I wasn't asleep. I was about to eat... Fine. A fellow-Thespian. Lying right beside me. Shakespeare. I can't come. I'm working all week. THE MANNEQUIN"S BALL No, the same old treadmill. No, I'm still hacking it. Good night. It's enough to drive you crazy! It's that guy's from the fifth floor. Shake it - it might stop! Around the rugged rocks... She sells sea shells... As if the lady has lines to speak... But she's going to be in LEAR. Cordelia... Good morning. Where is it? The spring's bust. The junk they turn out these days! Locks used to work. I'll fix it tomorrow. Doing anything new? New, no. Just the Mannequin. Yeah, you told me. Is it true that Lipka, that TV entertainer... ...wears a wig? Maybe, but I wouldn't know. You bet he does! A guy in a wig, I ask you! A girI now - she wants to look nice... Give me a kiss... ...and I'll fix the lock today. You'd only take the kiss and run. Me? Never! Shame on you! Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. I talked to Lewicki. He'll probably cast you. As Cordelia. - That's wonderfuI news! - Isn't it? You can all but bet on it. Thank you. Ever thought of changing your hair? Making it lighter, blonde maybe? Why? I've so many brunettes in the company. Hi. Good morning. Tea please. Eva! Come and sit here. That's a pretty blouse. Made from three handkerchiefs. You'll go down in theater history. Why? You're the only woman who's resisted me. - You should try harder. - I'm scared of my wife. May I? What's that? Jumble. More like sudden death. No venison, mushrooms, prunes. Just sour cabbage and water. You can't get what you like - you like what you don't. You don't look well. One of the kids kept me up all night. What was the point of begetting three? One has to keep occupied. I dreamed a black dog grabbed my hand... ...and wouldn't let go. I've dreamed that two nights running. - What does it mean? - Someone'll badmouth you. I once... twice dreamed of butter. Once or twice? I had the dream, woke up, went back to sleep and... ...again dreamed I was eating rancid butter. Rancid butter means making a pile the hard way. Your diction, young man, is terrible. Listen! For sale. How much? A lot. Six thousand. My pay. Lewicki wants to see you. He's out front. Excuse me. Don't slouch! It's so cramped up there... - I need space. - The players could mingle. No, it'll need totaI conversion. I'II leave you. Sit down. I've had no opportunity to take a close look at you. Who were your teachers? Professor Piotrowska... ...and Mr Namyslowski. You're watching me watching you. I need to get a good look at you. I'm to direct LEAR here. But look at that stage. So dreadfully tiny. But for my LEAR I must have acres of space. I imagined you were a blonde. I just don't see this production yet. A lot of it I'd like to stylize... Gesture... The gesture must be musicaI. In the kabuki tradition. Japanese music... Is there some role you long to play? - In LEAR? - No, in generaI. Sometimes I think... ... I could play anything, and sometimes nothing. Nicely put. What good production have you seen recently? Maybe WO YZECK at the Proscenium? Come on, the second part blew up in his face. Funny how that guy has no sense of rhythm. But you can't learn rhythm - any more... ...than you can amass up talent. I think the second part was exceptionally together. It's a difficult one, LEAR. Take the first speech. Idiotic. A father asking which child loves him most. Or... The whole play's full of traps. And dead wood. I intend to do a lot of cutting. Or the Cordelia-FooI relationship. Very obscure. If you ask me... I think the FooI loves her. Sorry. But why are you so keen on kabuki gesture? You'd like to know everything. The FooI could be played by a girI. I'm still groping, but I'll get there. If you only... Television's doing a rerun of THE BATS. It's not recent but I had a biggish part. If you could find the time... - When? - The sixteenth. 8.15, ChanneI One. Mr Lewicki's wanted on the phone. Wait here, would you? Yes! But these are definitely nicer... Has Lewicki left? He's sorry but he was called away. Pigmalion theatre... I've no appetite, dear I'm not feeling well. If something upsets me I get sick at once. When the light bill came... ...and I read 700 zlotys. I collapsed. I just laid there on the floor. I called and called for help, but no one came. Imagine having to pay so much. Not to mention what my son pockets. After my attacks I'm in a bad way. The neighbours couldn't care less. Unlike you. How can I ever make it up to you? By getting well. Does your son visit you? He's no good. How can God inflict so much suffering? Is it perhaps to make it easier to die? I brought you this. Thank you. You'll sleep better now. Good evening. We ought to give Teresa our love. - So call her. - Why me? Why me? He's into aerobics? That too. His main interest is his family tree. He's looking for the missing bits. I'm going to play Cordelia in KING LEAR. - That's a speaking part? - A role! About time. The cards were right. You're not pushy enough. It's "me first" these days. Especially in your profession. There's a picture of father I want to see. One in particular. Help yourself. One of these days I must sort them out. Who's this? A fellow-lawyer. The one who got father suspended. I told you about that. He spoke out once too often when it was best not to. And you? Did you love father? Of course I did. And he loved me. UntiI one day - I stopped loving him. Found that picture? - Here. - Mom, I don't need any. - I know what you make. - But I don't need it. Who doesn't need money these days? I'm worried about you. Are you still seeing Felix? Occasionally. You ought to marry him. Such a nice, decent boy. Stop throwing marriage at me all the time. Don't push me into it! We're still shooting. Maybe Wojtek'll fix something for you? I'm to be interviewed and all I can think of is shit. So say that. But I want to be very bright and witty. Who wouldn't? Say actors shouldn't talk about themselves, but act... ... if they get the chance. As an actress do you prefer film or stage? Sometimes one, sometimes the other. No! Movies - there's always something going on. And in the theater it isn't? What about that metamorphosis... ...when you feeI an audience suddenly becomes spellbound? But that vanishes without trace. Sometimes it leaves a mark. On us, on the audience. Tell me, Magda, do you consider your profession ...to be a creative or a performing art? Performing verging on creative. What does love mean to you? It's a private matter. But have you never pressed your sinfuI body... ...against another sinfuI body? - I have. - That is a sin. A mortaI sin. Have you ever looked at lewd pictures? I have. What did they show? Bananas and pineapples. What they call sex - do you have it often? I don't keep count. Have you ever seriously considered... ...sleeping with someone to get a part? - They don't ask that. - Readers wish they would. I can't do it without love. So you wouldn't put out? If the part was worth it, yes... No... What do you like, Miss Eva? Actors. If they're good... - Mushroom soup... - If it's good.... What do you dislike? Sweetbread. Magda, will I get to play Cordelia? I'm sure you will. Look! Zbig's stuck a head on the dog-cat. You don't know him. He's very versatile. I've noticed. He also writes poems. What are those tiny ones called? Kibuki? Come on, what are they called? - Haiku. - Gnomic haiku. Why don't you recite one? Surely if you write them you want them to be known? I've even thought... ...of working up these haiku into a show. We could tour it, couldn't we? Are you, my little shrikes, perchance a pair of dykes? Gay's the word, you'll have heard The old Adam - call me madam Fag or hag - it's all become an awfuI drag. Good evening. What are you doing here? I forgot my keys and no one's home. Be my guest. A spot of lunch! Go on. What do you want to be when you grow up? An artist. Actress? Artist. A painter. Do a picture of me. Very nice. BeautifuI. Is this your doll? It is. You have a daughter? No. If you did I could play with her. But me, won't you come and visit me? No. My parents don't allow me to visit strangers. 40 minutes? You don't say... why didn't you go then? I'm sorry it took so long. - Sure you can manage? - Yes. What's with that Grabowska and her tantrums? One tiny stain and she bites my head off! - She's cracking up. - But she's in every play. The manager... ... likes her. Too much, I'd say. When'll opportunity knock for you? Soon, I hope. Help yourself. My favorite used to be "Caravalle". You know, with the coconut chips. A reaI masterpiece! The nuts look reaI, don't they? Have you talked to Lewicki? There's something interesting about him, don't you think? I didn't notice. Did he tell you he wanted to cast a girI as the FooI? And the manager's wife as Lear? That could be interesting. Ours is the night under the stars... Having heard the evidence, the court... ...sentences the prisoner also known as the Leader... ...to execution by beheading. Thugs! Let me go! I'll call the police! It's a plot! I'II lodge a complaint in parliament! Where's my head? They've stolen my head! My ministeriaI head! The ball goes on! Hallo. Good evening. Yes, I was working. The same as usuaI. No, a small house. Yes, yes, I've eaten. No, I can't come. If for I want that glib and oily art. To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend, I'll do't before I speak. You're not with me? Nor am I sometimes. This'll be best. What about this one? Okay. The director can decide. But what is this anyway? I need more tape. I'm working on the leftovers! It can't go one like that! This is the girI Wojtek mentioned. We chose this hat but we have others. Turn round. Try this one. - I look an idiot in it. - Never mind how you look. What I'm after is some kind of a sign. The hero looks around and sees this hat. And it sets up associations. The face is less important. But I still don't know whom I'm playing. You're playing a Woman in a hat. Right, here's what you do: From that corner... you follow the wall... ...walking toward the camera. We'll do a run-through. Action! Go! But where am I going? Who am I? Who's she? Never mind. We're not getting into Stanislavsky. But I have to know. Sometimes it's best not to. We're hinting things. What things? Are you doing this scene or not? I'm sorry. I seem to have been misinformed. I quit! Wojtek! Where did you dig her up? Now, Cordelia, what can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters? Nothing, my lord Speaking to me? Nothing? Nothing will come of nothing Good Cordelia, speak again But you are talking? If our paths separate now... ...they're liable never to cross again. You needn't believe me but that's how it is... ...with paths that cross. Got any glue? What? You know, glue. For gluing. I've some in the car. For tires. My heeI's come unstuck. My car's here. Can I drop you anywhere? No. Sure? You're an actress? A prompter. Thank you. Keep it. For the cobbler. Don't go yet. I have to. That certain swine are happy without metaphysics... ...does not prove its worthlessness. Is swinishness to be our touchstone? You left this in the john. Why does everything seem to have been deliberately... ...dislocated and displaced? Roles, coiffures, minds, complexions - all inverted? You left this in the john. Return it - keep the deposit. Have you talked to Lewicki? After a fashion. Did he go on about Japanese music and kabuki? He did. And about musicaI gesture? And seeing RICHARD II at Mme Mnouchkine's? No. He will. How are the designs for LEAR coming along? Darling, don't ask! Drapes, sacks... AII I do is dye, patch, alter. Povertyville! No materials anywhere. Zilch! Cordelia? - Can I take this? - Sure. Some biddy's split her old man's skull. Skulls are no problem but where did she get an ax? Come on! You can buy axes. Where? Any country store. Good morning! HaiI, Lear! Don't get up. I haven't forgotten THE BATS. What's cooking? Some woman's chopped up her old man. Ho ghastly! Well now, what was I...? Ah, yes. I wonder if I could have a few words with you... ... before the read-through. All right? Of course. Any time. Good morning, Mr. Director! Do you know what Count Tolstoy called Shakespeare? A hack. He thought HAMLET and ROMEO AND JULIET... ... nauseating, boring rubbish... ...and KING LEAR a sloppily written mess. Counts can take liberties. That essay by Tolstoy is well worth reading. I'm sure it is. There's no love lost between geniuses. Neatly put, very. But let's consider our situation: for his LEAR Kurosawa spent three years... ...on the costumes alone. Stein takes two years over rehearsals. At that rate I'd starve to death. God knows how our LEAR will work out. It's a play that sometimes really scares me. Still... Good morning. Your tea rations can be collected... ...from the dressers. I must dash - I have to see the manager. See you! I must dash... Lear is not senile. He was made to feeI all-powerfuI. He can't stand the truth, not even from Cordelia. ...and my poor Fool is hanged. Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life, and thou no breath at all? Thou'It come no more... Tell me... ...what should Cordelia be like? Good... Good. She should love her father. It's been 42 days since we last saw each other. I've been keeping count. Don't laugh. Think of me at all? Yes. We can't go on like this. Always apart. It's time we lived together. Join the theater in Gdansk. You're too good an actress to be playing walk-ons. In Gdansk I can write my own ticket? I've a buddy who knows the manager. He could talk to him. Something can be arranged. You could even quit. There are other careers. I can earn enough to keep us both. All right, lets' drop it. Try it on. It's Indian. I had to see you. You sounded so strange on the phone. That Shakespeare joke - not bad! Let's get married. Why do you want to get married? So that you'll always be mine. Don't come here again. Let's call it a day. I've just been to a Swedish movie. They've gone completely mad. - They're displaying genitals! - No! And raping chickens! Go see for yourself. This farmhand jumps a chicken and... But it's been sold out for weeks. Sex! Horror! Thriller fiction! Sex, sex, sex... It's not a big room. An old couple, a bit odd. But they'll take an actress. Provided she's childIess. I said you were. You are, aren't you? The rent's 6.000- steepish but your present place... Instead of THE BATS as announced... ...our play for tonight is A GLASS OF WATER. We apologize for this change of program. Could I speak to the director? Is Mr Lewicki there? I'll call later. I've been thinking. You could knit a skirt and turn it into a dress. I was so counting on him seeing me in THE BATS. He can see it on video. How? I know someone who can arrange a screening. I can just see Lewicki rushing round for my sake. Leave that to me. I don't even know if I want to do this LEAR. Or if I'll be able to. Why? I'm pregnant. You are? But Zbig once said he didn't want a child. That doesn't mean a thing. They all say that. He'll be thrilled, you'll see! Now then, where'll we put the cot?... Here? No - there! Hey there. See what I managed to get! Pea cutlets, bean pate... ...and a bottle of Plavac! Lovely! But I've got to put Eva up for the night. Monsters! You'd throw me out into the cold and sleet? Couldn't I snuggle up in between? Give me a break, good ladies. What have we here? MackereI? It's hedgehog, not mackereI! Where do they import this muck? We're going to the dogs! Fish! Theater! The theater's run into a crisis. What do those slobs write for it? They blow bubbles out their noses, ears, whatever. The toilet falls in on them and they just twitter! Tatty plays, empty houses! We don't have a prayer! You sure don't, the way you're hamming. We all have our off days. Don't be a pig! I'll go make some tea. Piss off! Eva, you'll know. I dreamed about Lewicki. He launched a balloon with a bastard child inside. - What does it mean? - What size balloon? A big one. A big balloon means trouble. - A small one, a journey. - No. A big balloon means bad company. More than anything in the world I'd like to traveI. Really? To visit Mexico. In that case, you will. I'd have to live on air for a year. And who'd invite me? St. Francis. He was a saint noted for his goodness. Hopeless causes are St. Jude's department. Are you a professionaI photographer or an amateur? A bit of both. Do you have a father? Yes. What's he like? Stubborn. Occasionally, childish. Why do you ask? No reason. What about your father? He's a king. Ye jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes... Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are; And, like a sister, am most loth to call your faults as they are nam'd. Love well our father. To your professed bosoms I commit him: But yet, alas, stood I within his grace. I would prefer him to a better place. So, farewell to you both. I had a stupid dream. I was afraid you were sick. A doctor doesn't have time to be sick. How's MichaI? He's left the Institute. He couldn't stand it. They were going to transfer him. - He doesn't tell me everything. - What's he doing now? He's become a mice freak. The grind's killing me. First, the kid to schooI... ...then the hospitaI, the shopping, the cooking... AII I dream of is bolting the door and falling asleep. I envy you. I bet. I do! I know an actress who lives only for her dog. And me? AII I do is wait. Me, I don't have the time to wait. It's you... us... they ought to be waiting for. Why have you broken up with Felix? Why did you lead him on? I don't know. Fear of loneliness, I guess. But it turned into soap opera. I was play-acting. But what about him? Don't worry, he'll find someone. I make tails out of this. I earn more than at the Institute. An electronics engineer... MateriaI for the paws is a problem. Don't you like them? Father made you give up ballet schooI. He didn't want you giving yourself airs. Though he loved watching you dance. He'd have told me what matters in life. He'd been through a lot. Mother said he got into politicaI trouble. Made waves, I suppose? I remember how frightened I was once. He came home sick. Mother made him a scene. I've often wondered whether I ought to tell you this... Father kept out of politics... He was never victimized. Except by himself. With mother's help you've created a legend... Innocent people did go to jaiI. All sorts of people... But not father. As for mother... She had an affair with some jumped-up nerd. Father found out and hit the ceiling. I heard him calling mother a whore. He began to drink. It was all too much for him. Before, he may have cheated on her himself. He thought his honor... He talked a lot about honor, but what it actually meant? He talked about it most when he had a few drinks. He'd come home drunk and apologize next morning. That time you were scared was one of his jags. In the end it went back to his work. When he insulted a big shot he was suspended. He tried to get out of it but couldn't. One day, drunk, he was hit by a car. The obituary described him as "a remarkable man... ... respected by all. " I didn't know. That's how it was. What you've said makes no difference. In fact I think I now love him even more. Poor father... A late night or been away? - Away. How about you? - I'm going fishing. I'll bring some fish. And fix the lock! Tomorrow's Dee-Dee's birthday. Suppose I buy him an icon? - Buy him a sword. - What on earth for? To go with his blue blood. He's seeking his roots. He can hang it over the TV. Don't make fun. How about that role? Started rehearsals? Yes. You must tell me everything. What do you think of buying him a medaI? It's his hobby. He collects war medals, awards for valor. Because he was never decorated himself. He's simply interested in medals. He loves them. He has Serbian, Bulgarian, French from Verdun. He can look at them for hours. This one would do... It's too small. Nothing'll go in. It's only a cup, not a teapot. Can I help you? I'd like to see that cross. It's from World War I. "Pour la merite" A German decoration... ... but with a French name. - How much is it? - 22.000 Expensive, but very rare. I must be going or I'll be late. Take care of yourself. Good evening. Don't take it bad. It's going to bomb anyway. Broadway all over. I must talk to you. I know what you think. That fucking bitch stole my part. You're pissed off because you were promised Cordelia. But don't feeI sore with me, dear. We both know that directors run the show. I called Lewicki. I can't stand the thought of having hurt someone. I know you could murder me. I came close to suicide in a similar situation years ago. I appealed to Lewicki but he bawled me out. Mind your own business, he said. I did it for you. It's so long since you had a decent part. On stage, girls! I'll do my best to see you're understudy. We can rehearse together. Observe each other... ...and borrow anything that could be good. Eva, I know that... I know that down deep you're tough. Actually, I'm also hung up on life. And despite appearances I'm very sensitive. Another person wouldn't have said anything, would she? And screw you too! It's nothing. The old man's feet are killing him. It's six o'clock. The weather in Warsaw will be... Heard the news? LEAR's been canceled. Lewicki's wangled himself a television production. He's also got something lined up in Zurich. For which he'll be paid ten times as much. Why are you laughing? No reason. Where are you going? You'll eat it all up, won't you? Good morning, Miss Maria. Hello. I respect you a lot for being so good... ...to my Mom. I've run into a reaI tragic situation. I need 200 zlotys. You'll oblige, won't you? I will not. In that case you listen to me! You come round here with milk for Mom, right? And shoes and things? But it's not out of kindness! You've got an angle! You're counting on Mom leaving you this place. And I will, you'll see! Mom don't need no handouts! I can look after her! And I've first claim on this apartment. By right! You bitch! Go hustle elsewhere! You're too dumb! Too full of shit! Go on, get the fuck out, you rotten cow! Have you told him? No. Why not? I don't know. I've been offered leading part in a film. Three months from now. What'II I do with my belly? So it's film or baby. Maybe I'm stupid. Female mannequins on stage. Eva, on stage please. Eva, on stage, now! Now, ourjoy. Although the last, not least To whose young love the vines of France And milk of Burgundy strive to be interess'd What can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters? Nothing Nothing? Nothing, my lord How so? Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again Unhappy that I am! I cannot heave my heart into my mouth I love your Majesty according to my bond Nor more nor less Good my lord You have begat me, bred me, lov'd me I return these duties back as are right fit, Obey you, love you, and most honor you Why have my sister's husband if they say they love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, That lord whose hand... ...must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty No, no! Come, let's away to prison: We two alone will sing like birds I the cage: When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness; So we'll live, and pray, And sing, and tell old tales, And laugh at gilded butterflies, And hear poor rogues talk of court news; Who loses and who wins; Who's in, who's out; And take upon's the mystery of things And we'll wear out in a wall'd prison Packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by the moon.
