Mother? Father? Can you see me? Hi there. Here. Cinderella! No! Where have you been? She's awake! Take this. Hurry! Cinderella! You're looking fresh as the morning dew. Hurry! Cinderella? Hey! Now. Hurry! -Where is Cinderella? -She's ... She's sitting by the fire. In the ashes ... There you are. You're filthy. Clean up and go see Dora. She needs you. Remember who's coming? Yes, the Prince. "Yes, the Prince." Who was that? Who? It was me. Cinderella, of course. I apologize. -Some legacy your father left me. -Don't bad-mouth father. Are you being rude? No. You're spoiled. Thanks to your father. He took you hunting. Like you were a boy. Made you think you were special. You're nothing! Cinderella! Hello! The Prince will be here soon and I have a hair ... situation. Hurry! We have one chance to get invited to that royal ball. Don't screw up. Have you been out in nature? Haven't I told you to stay here? -But it was ... -Don't talk back. Go to your room. And don't show yourself until the Prince has left. Cinderella? Thank you. Here you go. You're lucky, Idun. You can fly wherever you want. He can tell when you're near. They're coming! They're coming! Find your positions! If you met the Prince, he would fall head over heels. Hardly. Princess Cinderella? Never say never. There's a reason why your stepmother is keeping you away from him. It doesn't matter. I have Balder. You know ... They're going to be busy for hours with those royal visitors. Don't stare. People stare at them all the time. Look casual. Don't look at the ground. -Where should I look? -Stop being so difficult. Just smile and act natural. Your Majesties. It is an honor to be graced by your presence. Perhaps the Prince has his own cortege? The Prince sends his best. He had some important lessons today that he couldn't miss. Okay ... Please come in. Welcome to our humble provincial abode. "Lessons"? What could I say? That he has run off again? Just smile. There you are. Fly! Hello there. You sure are handsome. Who might own such a lovely horse? A little hot-headed? Don't shoot animals you don't intend to eat! Says who? You? Is this your forest? It sure isn't yours. Okay, what if it was? The forest belongs to the animals. You're quite cheeky. And you should keep an eye on your horse. Easy now. Easy, easy. He's a little wild. He isn't quite broken in. Is he fast? Fastest horse around. I see. First one to the top. Then we'll see. If you dare. Why should I race against you? Don't you know who I am? Yes. You're the last one to the top! Giddyap! Come on! Fall asleep? Yes! Look out for the cliff! Easy, boy. Easy. Easy, now. Are you okay? He was just frightened. He needs to learn you're a team. That you're not forcing him. Who are you? -Prince? -There you are! -Where did you go? -Prince? We found your crossbow. I... What are you doing? Learning how to break in my horse, apparently. By her? -Are you a stable boy now? -Stable boy? No way. Do you want to talk to girls, or go hunting? Hunting. Let's go hunting. Can I come? This isn't for girls. We can't hang out with servants. See you later. Yes, we really should be going. But what about ... What? Won't you stay for supper? An evening meal. You have a long journey ahead. And you could see Dora dance. She loves to dance. It's been her only joy in life since she lost her father. We really must go. Of course. I wouldn't want to keep you. I'm merely a humble woman from a humble farm - - where trivial pleasures and dreams - - like attending a ball ... Imagine that I had such dreams for my daughter! Attending a royal ball? But what is life without dreams? We can always dream. We hope you will be able to attend. What is this? An invitation? To the ball? For us? That is too much. Thank you, Your Majesties! Can we go now? We're going to the ball! We're going to the ball! It's an invitation to the ball! You have one focus now. Do you know what it is? -My wedding! -No, the Prince is your only focus. Dora, imagine that you will become a princess! Are they scaring you? They aren't dangerous. It's just a ball. A silly ball. She didn't tell me her name. Your Royal Highness! Your ... Your Highness! Please ... His Majesty. Your father. He is looking for you. You must return immediately. Wouldn't it be better to wait? Please, Your Royal Highness. I promised Their Majesties - - that I would teach you refined conversation techniques - - and ballroom dance. For the ball, Your Highness. Ballroom dance? It's never wrong to learn ballroom dance. -It's because he's getting married off. -I know. Forget it. I'm not dancing. Where are you going? Your Royal Highness! Come back! Please! I have a responsibility! Your Royal Highness! May I go over the list for the procession, Your Majesties? Mrs. Munthe von Morgenstierne and her daughters - - are behind the Løvenskiold daughters in the polonaise. Though poor now, the Løvenskiolds were raised to the peerage first. Good morning. So this is when you decide to get up. Sit. Where were you yesterday? I had ... lessons. Ballroom dance. I'm actually quite exhausted. Think I was born yesterday? No, not at all. -You find this funny? -No. You think I'm doing this for fun? Your mother and I aren't crisscrossing the kingdom because we think it's fun. -I'm sorry. -Don't apologize, son. -Memorize the guest list! -Why? Give that to the girl you choose. -At the ball? -Yes. At the ball. Look at it as an opportunity. You can choose between the most beautiful girls in the kingdom. -And if I don't like any of them? -We have gathered the daughters ... But I don't want to marry some spoiled girl that I don't even know. You will do as I say. Dance, converse, be gallant. And select a girl before the end of the evening. Or I will select one for you. No. No. No ... no! That doesn't work at all. -We can sew it in. -It will rip, Dora. -What do you think? -Nice color. Wrong. It's the color of soup. -Ugly. -You aren't even looking. It's ugly. A little big, maybe? -The dress isn't too big. -Right. Too small? It isn't the dress. It's more ... Straighten up. Chin up. Smile. Not that grimace! Dora, can't you just be more regal? No, mom, I can't! Those aristocratic girls have tailors, hairdressers, stylers ... -Stylers? -Yes, stylers! Experts! Is it any wonder I look like crap? Cinderella! Don't cry. I'll get a migraine. I'm not crying. You look lovely. No one asked for your opinion. Find Alfred. Have him go into town and find the best - - styler in the country. -Styler? -You wouldn't know what that is. And then do the laundry. Let me help you. Lighten your load. I'm going to town to find a "styler." Anything to keep up appearances. You're the one who should be going to that ball. Shall I bring you anything from town? Bring ... A gown with a train. And a tiara. Bring whatever drops in your lap. One, two, three, one, two, three ... Excellent! Wonderful. Truly wonderful. I think we have the basic steps, more or less. I'm thinking you two can be a couple. There we go. Great. And you and I are a couple. You and I can be the girls. Remember your posture, Bendik. Your posture. And tighten your bum cheeks. One, two three ... And turn. Look at them. Excellent, boys! Lovely. Look at them! How lovely! See that, Your Highness? This is what I'm talking about. Your ... Your Highness! One, two, three ... You're getting me excited. Fine, let's dance. Like a group of swans. Right, like swans. Boys! Lovely posture, Bendik. -Me? It was Sami. -You were leading. -Leading? -The man usually leads the woman. I know what it means ... Boys! Watch this. Pay attention now. Watch this. Hello there! Here I come to the rescue. Baron von Snaus, thank you for coming. I usually don't work in the boondocks, but a royal ball is a royal ball. I know what princes like, I can guarantee you that. Come on in. Not you! Out of the way, Cinderella. Russet overdose! I told you to move. -Dora? -I see! So she is my subject. I understand. Exciting. I do love a challenge. Yes. There is something here. Her skin needs bleaching. A sign of distinction. Do you have any chlorine? Yes, of course. Spring or autumn? This has to go, for starters. Nothing but lentils and beans until the big day. -What are you planning to wear? -Me? You know what they say: All girls become like their mothers. The Prince might find her provincial. No, god forbid! So that means two gowns, one for each. I love snappy decisions. -In with the fabric. -The fabric! Hurry, Alfred! But we have to do something about this. Her energy pollutes my creativity. Her grayness kills my creativity. You're killing his ... caritivity. This will be fun. This is what fell in my lap. -Thank you. -You can't simply give her gifts. Give it to me. Alfred gave her a gift. -Three old nuts. -How sweet. Lovely. A rat! Cinderella, kill it! Shoot it! Now! Can't you do anything right? Get out! What were you doing in there? Go on. Father's bow? What am I to do with this? Relax, it's only me. Left? Or right? You choose, Balder. You, here? Hi there. Where's your owner? Hey, you! Get away from there! I thought you were a horse thief. My apologies, sir. Are you looking for the boys? The boys? You're a friend of the Prince's, right? They went up in the mountain to hunt for birds. And I mean birds, - - not "birds." If you know what I mean. Are you going to the ball? That Prince sure is lucky. Imagine being able to choose between all those babes! Personally, - - I'd choose a blonde. What do you like best? Brunettes. I'll take care of this fella. If you hurry, you should catch up to them. Good luck at the ball! Bye. Can't we call it a day? -I'm freezing. -You're always cold. Have you also noticed? I wonder if it has to do with my circulation. Should we go? Stop it! We can't come home empty-handed. Should we let Sami freeze to death because you don't want to go to the ball? Fine. Here's what we'll do. The first one to shoot anything - - gets this ring. Now we're talking. A reward. It's impossible! Stop complaining. A hawk! No, we don't shoot things we don't eat! Since when? Huh? What just happened? Whose arrow is this? This isn't possible. Isn't it? I think that's mine. Are you just going to stand there? Who are you? Don't you recognize me? -No. -A grouse! Then your memory isn't very good. Where did you learn to shoot like that? From my father. Then you are very fortunate. My father does nothing but nag. What does he nag about? Everything. He wants me to grow up and marry. And you don't want to? All I really want to do - - is ride around in nature. -I know what you mean. -He shot it right through the heart! Shall we continue? No, we have a winner. -He wasn't in on the bet. -He wasn't. You have earned it. What's your name? I can't. Just tell me who you are. You heard the Prince. Say something. Who are you? -Hello! -Guys ... -Come here! -Sami! Sami? You should be more careful. Have you been out? What were you doing out there? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing? Show me your hand. What is it you're up to? Honorable lady? Will you be attending the castle ball this evening? If you go, I'm sure the Prince would be quite excited. Cinderella? The lady of the house needs you. Don't just stand there. Fix Dora's hair. Sit down, Dora. Sorry. I'm just not sure this is me. No one leaves me looking like themselves. Cinderella, her shoes. But stay out of their way. -The sled is ready. -And red carpet. Exhale. -There we go. -Let me look at you, Dora. Absolutely perfect. Sweet little Dora. You truly are a genius, Baron. I am almost touched. A gown worthy of a queen. -Seriously? -If you smile. And stand up straight. Now let's look at you. You're pretty much set to go. Listen. Don't be nervous. You look lovely. Thank you. May I have this dance? Come on. How cute you two are. Perhaps - - Cinderella would like to attend the ball with us? Do you mean it? My god! You almost had me fooled! Sweet Cinderella. I want every sequin sorted according to color. They need to be kept busy. They need to know their place. Give them a finger ... Don't forget to wear this. Countess Veronika of Langdalen and her daughter Dagne. My stomach hurts. It's just nerves. Countess Jensine von Tönder and her daughter Josefine. Countess Susanne von Sæter and her daughter ... Dora! I can't help it. And don't giggle. It doesn't become you. -Are you paying attention? -Sure. Unless you want to marry those two idiots, I'd start focusing. -Would you marry anyone here? -Let the boy breathe. Don't you start! -Can't we postpone it? -Certain things can't be postponed. This is - - Dora and her mother. Your Majesties, it is an honor. The greatest honor of my life. He's smiling at you. -See what I mean? -I married at your age. But father, you married mother. I have to marry a stranger. Go dance. Fine! He is so handsome! He's mine! Thank you. Do you think ...? Mother's ball gown. May I? -Is something funny? -No! Do you like the music? Perhaps you prefer baroque? What can I say? Diet and exercise. I try to take care of my ... body. I can see you take care of yours. I haven't eaten anything but beans and lentils lately. Do you like ... Is that something you like? Beans and lentils? I love beans and lentils. Wait here. What ...? What are you doing? How about something less upbeat? -A slow dance. -They can play whatever. I am done here. He isn't ... You aren't done! Nice to see you again. I don't believe we have met. Are you sure? Who is that? Would you ... Want to dance? Yes. Very much. She's lovely. I have goosebumps. It might be easier with music. Play! Come on, play! -We have to get her up here. -No. Just let them dance. Won't you remove your veil? Not here. Can't you see he's in love? In love? Without my permission? Did you ask for permission? He takes after you. He takes after you in what's important. But I want to know who you are. Can you give me a hint? The first time ... Face full of soot. But no chimney sweep. Second time ... A hat. With a feather. Bow and arrow. But no hunter. Third time ... A gown. With a train. But no princess. Hang on. There's something familiar about ... Can't you just tell me who you are? But ... No! Go ahead, son. Run! Prince! To the horses! Come on! Spread out. Search the entire area. Check every farm, large or small. Just find her! Pardon me. I'm looking for a girl in an ice-blue dress. No. No? -Sorry. -Thank you. Hello? Hello? Wake up! What's all this ruckus? My god! The Prince? -Who is master here? -We have a mistress. But she's at the ball. At the ball? -I'm looking for a princess. -A princess? Here? Or at least a girl. -A very beautiful girl. -There are many beautiful girls here. -What age group were you thinking? -Any. All the girls at this farm. I can't wake up all ... Please. It's important. Go wake everyone up. Right. Well, I'm awake already. But the others will be here shortly. Stop! Please help me! Is that the Prince? That little bastard! Do as I say now, Dora. For once, I want you to do exactly as I say. It would be easier if you knew what you were looking for. She had an ice-blue gown and some kind of veil. I have this. This shoe will help me recognize her. Whoever this shoe fits, - - I will marry. This is terrible. I think the Prince has lost his mind. Come on! All girls come down here! I want every girl to try on this shoe. Don't worry. Sit down here, all of you. So Cinderella went to the ball. In a stolen gown. Give me that gown. No. Give me that gown. Push a little harder. Who could have feet that small? That shoe isn't going to fit anybody. Are you sure there's no one else? What about Cinderella? Cinderella ... Cinderella? Then go get Cinderella! Cinderella? Cinderella? Cinderella? Help! Hel... Please ... No, no! No! Please! Help! Help! Prince? No! Wait! Keep your head down, don't say a word, - - and don't let him see how tall you are. Prince! I've been looking for you. -Why? -Excuse me? Why? Is that your daughter? I would like to ... I would like to marry her. All you have to do is ask. Hi. Won't you look at me? There! Hey. Come help me. Will you try the shoe? -The shoe? -Yes. Could you try it on? No, I see no need for that. Don't you recognize her? Come on. Just a little more. -Why won't she speak? -She's waiting for the ring. I'd like to try the shoe first. The ring first. Thank you! You can't take advantage of a girl until you make a commitment. No. The shoe first. No! She isn't trying that shoe on! Come on. Go! Wait! Giddyap! No! But this is nothing. It's just me. That will have to do. -Faster, faster! -Slow down, mother! Where are we going? Don't talk while I'm thinking! No! No! Mother! Stay still! Mother! Ow, mother! Grab my hand! I've got you. Everything is fine. But ... It isn't you. You aren't her. I'm sorry. Stop! Help! Help me! So you're going to be queen? A little servant girl? Filthy little - - Cinderella. You are nothing. You are nobody. You are nobody. You are nothing. You are nobody. You are nothing. You are nobody. You are nobody. No! Help me! Hello? Help! Hang on! I've got you! -Get me loose! -Shut up, mother! You found it. I don't need this to know it's you. Face full of soot. But no chimney sweep. Hat with a feather. Bow and arrow. But no hunter. Gown with tail. But no princess. It was you. It was you all along. This belongs to you. Will you marry me? Marry? If you will have me. Of course. But we have only just met. Isn't that how it's done? We can do whatever we want. -I'm freezing. -One more farm. Stop! What is this? What do you want? -We're looking for a princess. -You too? You can call off the search! Hurrah! Tor? The bell! Time for a party. That gown really is you. You just go up to your room - - and stay there, okay? May I have this dance? Now what? In fairy tales this is where we kiss. Yeah? But you'll have to catch me first! Subtitles: Nick Norris
