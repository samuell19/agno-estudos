A moment, please. Damn you. Were you sleeping? Jesus, what's going on here? Sorry, I fell asleep. What the fuck is in this? This coffee's shite. What's wrong with it? Why don't you taste it? Seriously, you wanna poison me? So, what did you end up deciding in the end? I've accepted the assignment. Really? You wanna go all the way up there? You really think it's a good idea? And your nightmare... Hey, I'm fine now, okay? I just had a lot going on. Still. I don't think it's a good idea. If I were you, I'd just take a break. I really wanna make some life changes, don't you get it? It's just a chance to step up and get promoted, that's all. Believe me. I really wanna move out of here. Why? What's wrong with this place? It's getting late, I must head to the office. Hi, can you tell me where I can find Ann? Hey, wake up! You seen her? Okay, got it. Where has she gone? Tell her I'm looking for her. - Okay. - Tell her! Okay. Repeater's out of commission. Could've been a lightning strike. Nah man, it's the software. Yeah, I hope so, otherwise we'll have to go back and replace the entire power line. Still, better to be optimistic when the going gets tough, eh? Who designed the software anyway? The Dynamic Group? Dynamic Group. Dynamic shit. Move your hand. It'll be a right laugh if we have to stay out there for God knows how long. May I? What do you want, Robert? I'm rather swamped. Ready to leave? Yeah, I'm just collecting some things. As I mentioned, you'll have to take everything you need with you to spend the night... There won't be any need for that. If it's what I think it is, I'll just have to reinstall the operating system and realign the parables. The repeater shows no signs of life, you couldn't even reach it online. Listen, about us, are you sure... We already talked about that. There's nothing more to add. Close the door when you go. Oh, there you are at last. Do you mind telling me where you were? I was downstairs. What do you want? Bye bye, Robert. What was he doing in your office? Have you or have you not broken it off with him? Of course. He just has to come to terms with it. Hey, it's good to have you with us. So, they make you and me do the dirty jobs, huh? Hey, question. What the hell is going on here? Are we gonna have to stay out of there all night? I'm gonna fix the damn repeater fast. All right, boss? Shut up, Mike. Hey guys, look! Woop! Oh my god! This is for the mission. Pure analog sound. What is that? Amigo, this is the ultimate in cool. The ultimate in cool. You're telling me that that antique actually works? Oh my god! Hey. Oh, turn it down, will ya? When that music was popular you weren't even born yet. Go. Well, I think it's great. Where in the hell did you find it? Oh, Jesus Christ. This is awkward to start. Turn that down! Se√±or. Turn it down! What are you? Get the hell out! Come on, man, give me help with the unloading. Come on, man. Sick and tired of this already. We are gonna end up getting lost. I'm not getting any coverage. Yeah, that'll be the repeater. Hey, do you guys have any saltines? I ate too much sugary crap on the way. I swear, when I get back I'm demanding a fucking raise. Jesus Christ, what a shitty job. Hey man, don't complain. I make half your salary and I got to bust my ass twice as hard. Yeah, how about giving it a rest. It's just that I don't squander my entire salary on video poker. A serious lack of what's up. Mate. You are getting on my nerves. Hey you. Leave him alone, he's just a kid. Kid? Poor baby. - Hey, Phil? - Yeah? Take a photo of me? Why, why not? Come on. Smile. - Nice! - Yeah, now let me you. Yeah, sure, take one of me. - Yeah. - Yeah. Come on! Cool. Hey, Georgie! Nice! Hey guys, I think this place is infested with elves. For God sake! How stupid are you? When are you gonna decide to grow up? I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose! And wanting to bring a noisy piece of junk What are you doing? With you in the first place? - Give me it! - That's my radio, you son of a bitch! My radio! You're a shit, mate. Hey, come here. This way! Differential's shot. Must've been a lightning strike. How can you be so sure of that? You fucked it up. There's no line. Great. Great! Speak to me, Georgie! Um, where is you? Will you not, I don't wanna be here a week. Don't worry, Mike. Georgie's gonna fix everything now. Why is the SOS light on? Because it's under... Yeah, I don't think she were asking you. Because it's under the low voltage auxiliary line. Don't look at me. I'm not going up there. You're the expert. Son of a bitch. It's crashed. Hey, it's crashed. My god, are you sure? Can I get some light here, please? I can't see shite. Where did the plane end up? It crashed on the other side of that hill, I'm sure of it. How can you say that? You can't know that. Maybe it's still flying. I definitely heard the sound of the impact. It wasn't loud, but... Oh, for Christ's sake, man, speak up! Well, even if it wasn't loud, it was recognizable. I'm sure of it, it definitely crashed. Mike's right. I said it crashed! In which case, what are we doing here? Let's move. Somebody was on board and we don't even know if they're okay. Yeah, let's go take a look, it might've been carrying somebody. Don't even think about it, we've got work to do here. Georgie, what are you saying? A plane just crashed, for Christ's sake! We need to go check it out. Yeah, the repeater can wait. Come on, let's go. Fucking door, open! Get the door open, get me outta here! Get me outta here! Get me the fuck outta here! Get me out! This way! Come on out! Open the fucking door! Come out! Get me, get me the fuck out! Now! Now! Get me out! Christ's sake! Come on, I'll take you, come here. Come here, it's okay. Hey! Give me your hand! Everything okay? Nothing broken? What? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm okay, I think I'm okay. You're in one piece? Did the pilot manage to send a mayday call and give your position? Hey, did you hear what I said? Yeah. I think so. What a landing. - Jack. - We should've sent the SOS from the repeater. Hey, guys. Who gave a license to Red Baron in the pilot seat? A repeater? The hell you talking about? The repeater. The one you were heading for into this outer hill. You missed it by half an inch. The pilot sent the mayday. Someone will be here soon, all right? Jack. I wanna get out of here. - Jack, get me away from here. - Georgie. You're not going anywhere with that. We set up a tent, we wait for the rescuers. Great. Now we have to play the fucking Red Cross. Oh, let go of my hair, you son of a bitch. Get your finger out your ass and those tents set up. If you haven't noticed, the poor woman's fainting. Oh, you bastard. What's wrong with you? Get a move on! Okay, I'm doing it. What do you plan to do? Are the rescuers coming or not? What do I plan to do, Ann? Since you wanted so badly to drag your ass to the rescue, you think of something. And fast. Now what do you want? Your turn to play guard dog, Philip. And what does a guard dog do? I'm sleeping along in the tent tonight. Got it? You stay out here, and you keep an eye on them. And you keep the worms company. Hey. Charlie Lindbergh. Here's your tent! You're putting it up yourself. So, three of you taking off. Where were you headed? Listen, asshole. No one asked you to help, so mind your own business. Got it? Hello, mate. Did you know you've got a really shit face, Don't worry, I'll put it up for you. Take it easy, man. Mike, stop being a dick. Do you understand me? I've... Just kidding around. Where are you? Georgie! Georgie! And what happened to Mike? He's disappeared. What happened to you? Hey, Alex. You awake? We're going to the plane right now, so, see ya later. Where you going now? Well, Jack just wants us to go to the plane and take a look, get a few things. Hey, Georgie, it's weird. Mike's disappeared. Nothing, I couldn't find him. Hey, we're coming too. We've got to find Mike. - Mike! - Oh, jeez. Hey, you know what time it is? How the hell do I know? You got the watch. Mike? Hey, Phil. You know what time it is? What's it like, 1800? 1800? I think your watch took a bad hit in that landing. It's 0900, amigo. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Easy guys, stop! I said stop! - Hey, I said stop! - Jesus! Let go of me! Let go! - I said! - You wanna fuck with me? Come on, then! Come on, then! Hey, that's enough! Hey, let go of my beard! You son of a bitch! Cool it, man. Get the fuck off me! Great, Mike. You've really gone and done it this time. Fuck you! I don't trust these bastards. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? I wanted to make sure there were no surprises. I want an apology here and now. An apology, right? You're joking, huh? We have a right to know who it is we're dealing with. No, Mike, I'm tired of your shit. This time I'm writing you up. Well fuck you too, Georgie. I'm leaving. Oh, that's what I've been saying all day. You idiot! Oh, go to hell, Phil. I'm fine, I'm fine. Oh, oh. He's capable of leaving us here, you know? Maybe you were a bit too hard on him, Georgie. You better go and get after him. Fine, I'll go after him. Christ's sake, Jack, will you get a grip? That bastard wanted to fuck with me. These idiots aren't gonna disappear, we need to create diversion. Yeah, but not by going and losing our cool on everything. All right, fucking ball buster. Oh fuck. Fuck. Mike, wait. I wasn't being serious earlier. Come on, talk to me. Mike! Mike! Mike! That was a real heroic effort on your part. Two guys fighting, a third guy jumps in... Fuck you want? How's your nose? Yeah, it's been better before, thanks. Fuck my nose. What about your hand, huh? It's taking too long. I'm gonna go look for them. You stay here and look after the others. Ann. Please, try and convince him to come back. I'm his assistant. Should've gone after him, you know? He's big enough to look after himself, don't you think? What a joke. Mike! Mike! Mike! Phil. Let's go check on Alex. Georgie! Go away please. I said go away and leave me alone. Georgie. What happened? What did you see? Tell me. What's going on, where's Mike? What did you see? Tell me! Georgie! Georgie, Georgie, Georgie. What's going on, where's Mike? What's going on, where's Mike? What's going on, where's Mike? So, what do you do for a living? I'm an accountant. Hey, Matt, do you like music? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah? Then later on I'm gonna show you something. Why not? What? What are you doing here? I was waiting for you at the plane. Georgie wanted to keep looking for Mike. Alone. Oh. Why are you touching me? Get your hands off! Don't you remember? Your tibia. Tibia? Your leg bone was sticking out of your skin. Where am I? I wanna get out of here. Jack, I wanna get out of here! You keep your voice down, we're not alone. Whatever, have you got my stuff? I need to sniff or I'm gonna have another crisis. In-fucking-credible. Georgie? Save yourself, Georgie. Georgie, well you won't die. Georgie, oh Georgie. - Georgie. - Come on, Georgie! Georgie, you can hear it. You can hear it! Stop it. Stop it! Can't take it anymore. Can't take this shit anymore. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Can't take this shit anymore. Georgie! Jesus Christ, we were scared shitless. Where the hell were you and Mike? Did you, did you convince him to come back? I think he wanted to force us to follow him. What? Why? Mike is who he is, but he wouldn't wanna get rid of us. He left all his things here. Something must've happened to him. You can walk now? We're going, hurry up. I'm fine, thanks for asking. I said hurry up. Hey, I don't understand how you don't remember anything after the crash. Listen, accountant. I only remember I couldn't stop laughing, okay? I was flying high. Don't get upset about it. The hole in my hand. What's wrong with your hand? I had a cut, I had a bad cut after the accident when I got off the plane. It's completely gone now. It's disappeared. It's true. Huh, me too. God. Voila! The scar I've had since I was a kid, it's gone. What a pile of crap. - Hey, you. - It's gone. - Is um. - How can this be? Is um the scar on my ass still there, or? Oh drop it, Phil. Whatever. You ready? Get your stuff, let's go. I don't think it's a good idea to leave now that help's coming. The only thing that matters now is getting out of this shithole as fast as possible. I don't wanna stay a moment longer here, this place gives me the creeps. But we need to stay by the plane. The rescuers might... What fucking rescuers? The pilot never sent a mayday call. Nobody knows we're here. The sooner we get outta this place, the better for everyone. How can he not have sent the mayday call? And what do you wanna do with your pilot? You wanna leave him there? You take me for a fucking gravedigger? It bothers you so much, why don't you do it yourself? It was that imbecile that got us in this mess. As far as I'm concerned, the dogs can have him. Son of a bitch. Why didn't he tell us that sooner? If we'd known that, it'd be game changer. We could've gone back to the repeater... Listen, hun, you need to calm yourself down, okay? Like he just said, there's no help coming. Anyway, who elected you group leader? Who the fuck do you think you are? Georgie, please, try to stay calm. Stay calm, Ann? Sure, that's easy for you to say after you dragged our asses into this shithole. Oh, not that again. Try to be less childish. Forget about the repeater. Careful, Ann, if it hadn't been... You're such an insufferable egotist, you can't think beyond your own ambitions... God, enough already! Jesus Christ! Phil's right, will you calm down? You're all just passing around blame when we don't even know what happened to Mike. God! You said you were gonna bring him back and you didn't. Something's happened to him. I'm sure of it. - Fuck! - Well, don't tell me, Phil. I was against it from the start. And it was stupid to come here without activating the SOS first. Oh, fuck off! I've had enough of you. Go to hell. Great. Now go look for our brilliant Mike on your own. All right, Georgie, time out. Okay? You're just starting to lose your senses a little bit but you can calm down. All of us can calm down. Well, tell her that then. Hey, Wonder Woman, are you stoned out of your mind? Have you got any left for me? I'm not high. You're the fucked up one. You don't even know where we are! Hey! Fuck you! Bitch. What do you think we should do? Hey, don't look at me, man. I'm not the one making decisions. Well your friend, she's got the right idea. I think we should stick together. Okay, got it. No rescue. We'll head for a van and you guys, you do whatever you want. Georgie. It's okay, we go with you too. Right, Jack? Okay, but keep your friend Mike well away from me or I swear I'll cook him up and have him for dinner. Hey, you got a problem? No, why? So stop watching me. Oh, relax. Just looking at your cute little ass. I know some customers that would pay well for that shit. Really, not bad at all. Keep your ears open, all right? Those idiots came down here in a camper van. When we get there we need to ditch them. Then what? Well... Wait a minute. What do you plan on doing? Steal it. Go back when the waters are calmer. - Jesus Christ, come on. - Just do what I say, okay? Unless you want your ex-wife's lawyer to know what you do for a living. I'm sure you'll like sending postcards to your daughters. Phil, slow down, wait for us. Phil, I said stop! Phil, stop! Phil, I said stop! Hey, marathon man. What's wrong with him? Phil! Jack, Jack, we need to go! We need to go! Let's go, Jack, let's go... Shut the fuck up, bitch! Do you hear it too? What? The radio? Off, damn it! It's a barrier. Georgie, come back. It's a force field, right? Georgie? That bastard tells me he loves me. The edge of a force field? Mind telling me what you're going on about? Yeah, it's possible. The interference deactivated the repeater. What do you reckon? I dunno. Something we haven't seen yet. Come on. Let's try somewhere else. Enough. We need to rest. We've been walking for hours. Hey, Matt. Do you like music? Later on let me show you something. Now what do we do? You saw that poor guy! Chocolate always melts in the sun. Hey! His name was Phil. What are you thinking about? Nothing, just looking at the lake. The epicenter of the transmission generating the force field is in that lake. Why don't we try disrupting the transmitter that's carrying the signal? Ann, you have to identify the entity and its source first. And what are we gonna do that with? Our phones? How the hell should I know, Ann? The ADF. Yeah. Yeah, the ADF, the ADF. It's a rather outmoded navigational tool used on airplanes, it's like a radio compass. It tunes into a broadcast station and the station indicates how to reach it. Now, if we can probe the frequency range, - if we can do that... - Fuck. That useless friend of yours got lost and dumped us in that damn lake. What the hell's that got to do with us now? Don't you get it? That's right, idiot. The signal got lost and left us to rot! Well why don't we go back to the plane and at least give it a go? Fuck that. You wanna go, go. I'm not going back to that cesspool. Well you got a better idea, then? Listen, smart-ass. Just because you know how to fly a plane, don't start getting fucking carried away. And for your information, I'm not going back to that wreck. - Got it? - Hey, look! Fuck, let's follow them. Maybe they'll lead us in the right direction. Okay, let's try. But carefully. Let's go. Be careful, Jack. It's all right. Fuck! What are you fucking laughing at? Great. Now what do we do? Listen, I don't feel like going any further. I say we go back to the plane and give it a try. We should figure out the problem. We don't know what or who we're dealing with here. Fuck! We can't get out of here. Fuck, I can't find my stuff! - Have you got any for me? - They'll hear you, - I haven't got it. - Well, I need it. I haven't got it, I told you. Now you pay me for it, anyway. Come on. In exchange I let you fuck me. You let me fuck you? I don't have to pay to fuck my women. They pay me when I go with clients and that includes you. Are you sure about that? Walk! This is not the time, you idiot. Asshole. Matt, you've given up, haven't you? What happened to you? You say that like you used to know me. What happened to me? I dunno, the usual things. Divorce, losing custody of the kids, and now, and now this. Food, survival. You know, it's complicated, but, I don't even think I wanna go home again. It's not like there's anybody there. Waiting, wondering, why the hell is it taking so long for Matt to come home? What kinda work do you do? Yeah, I'm an accountant. I do Jack's accounting. God, I'm hungry. What do we've got to eat in this fucking shitty lake of frogs? - And you, what do you do? - Fuck! I develop software for a company that makes satellite repeaters. That's interesting. No, no, I mean that. When I look at you I can tell you love what you're doing. Beginning I did. Then that all changed. Yeah, I can see that. What brought you here? To this prison? You know, aside from us, I think something else landed in that lake. Jesus Christ. How can he be that bad already? It's impossible after such a short time. Yeah, around here time is pretty much uncertain. I mean, look at your hand. The fuck we gonna do with that? You think it'll sink like this? Don't worry, I'm gonna undo it. My Jack, he can fix anything. Oh yeah, he's a real expert, right? Who knows how many times he's done it before. What you looking at? That's how you got to do it. Well, come on. Help me for once. You're always off your tits. That's the ADF instrument. That was indicating the direction, first of all, and to get to the radio station. At some point this little bastard's indicated direction changed. That caused us to veer off route. Pilot, I dunno. At some point he was okay with it and then he saw that we were, time was passing and uh, well, he veered off course and we lost all our fuel. He was a good guy. Okay. I hope I don't short circuit everything. I'm turning the power on. You ready? All right. Okay. For now I'm gonna turn this ADF onto listen. Did you ever think of becoming a pilot? Yeah, actually I did. And then I met Lucy, my ex-wife. She didn't wanna hear about me flying around in the skies with a bunch of flight attendants, so. Anyway, she convinced me to look for a job, how should I say, closer to ground? So I was good at math, so you know, I became a certified accountant. Yeah, whatever. She clipped my wings, right? What's got you now? We're like two lovers out on a little excursion, in a boat, except instead of there being a picnic hamper, there's a corpse covered in worms! You're always stoned. So? Have you got any hidden anywhere? Come on, Jack, show me the stuff. It's all your fault. Now I'm even having an attack. You're a shit. You made me come to this shithole without my stuff! Do me a favor, shut up. What I'm saying is, is this really a place to bring a woman to? Huh? Fuck off, shithead, I want my fucking stuff. Son of a bitch. I said shut it. Fucking ignorant gangster. Fucking whore! Now shut the fuck up or you'll be joining our friend in the fucking water! That sounds like a voice message. Hey, what do you think? What do you think? Your mind is me. Jack! Oh! Oh my god, Jack! Help me, Jack! Get out of there! Get out! - Hurry! - Fuck! Get out of there! - Jack! - Jack! Come on, Jack! Help me, God! Come on, Jack! - Jack! - Hurry! Get me out of here! - Fuck! - Come on! - Jack! - Hurry! - Fuck! - Keep going! Come on, Jack! Get out of there. Fuck! Get me the fuck out of here! Come on! Get me out here. Get me the fuck out of here! What is that dang force field? It's deactivating, your mind just means you're alive, means your, means your alive. Issues with Jack, issues with Jack. Your mind is mean, your mind is mean. Your mind is mean, your mind is mean, your mind is mean, your mind is mean, - your mind is mean. - Georgie. Hey. Georgie, you okay? We could be in the middle of an experiment. Yeah, that's it. They're using a weapon to experiment on us. Fucking great! Come on! Fucking come on! If I get my hands on you I'll fix your ass! Jack. Jack! Calm down. Calm down? Calm down? You calm down, asshole! Think about it, Georgie. We're dealing with a very powerful electromagnetic force field. Yeah, that's right! Wait a minute. If this is a scientific experiment, then they realize we're here, so sooner or later they're gonna come down and check on us for Christ's sake. Great, genius. And what the fuck difference would that make? What are we gonna do in the meantime? Sit here from dawn to dusk eating fucking frogs? Georgie, we need to get out of here fast. Sit down, dolly. I've had the arm already. I'm not having my balls fried now. It's not an experiment. I don't think it's a weapon, either. Your head is fucked. The dogs, the birds. They can go in and out. It's just us and only us that can't pass through. The mechanism's more complex. When Alexandria was attacked in the middle of the lake the force field stopped for a few minutes. That's the time to pass through it. Where the hell do you think you're going? There's something in that lake that won't let us out. Where were you going on that plane? Okay. It was a secret flight, all right? To avoid any security. Jack closed a deal, it was a shady deal, and we were coming home with the cash. I don't even know where the money comes from 'cause all I do is launder it. 'Cause I'm his accountant. Oh shit, Georgie. I got fired. If I don't cut a check to my wi, my ex-wife, then I don't get to see my kids. And they're all I got. You understand that? What have you been doing all night? I was looking for you. You were looking for me? Why, Ann? Are you afraid I'll get away from you, Ann? Why are you looking at me like that? Like what, Ann? Like what, Ann? Georgie, stop it! Are you getting turned on, Ann? Do you want me to touch you, Ann? Jack, wake up. Jack, wake up! Where the fuck? Ann and Georgie, they're not here. Where'd they go? Who gives a damn? It's exactly what we want. No, no, we got to go look for 'em. Are you crazy? They're out of our hair now. Get off your ass. Time to get my money back. I mean, what do you intend to do, Jack? I know what it is you're looking at. There's something in that lake you don't want us to know about. And it's not earthly. I'm not as stupid as you think, Georgie. And I also know that you've found a way out of this, like you always do. But this time you will not put me aside. Well, well, well, how moving. It's a lesbian romance. But before you start playing with each other's tits, where's my fucking money? - Jack, come on, now. - Shut it! We're leaving here, but not without my money! And how're you getting through the force field? I've got this! I can get through without pissing off Tutan-fucking-khamun. - Maybe they got an idea - I said shut it, dickhead. So come on, babe, show me the money or you're gonna be my bitch tonight! Dickhead! You're looking for this? You bitch! What are you fucking laughing at? - Fucking laugh at this! - Jack, no! Fucking bitch. Fuck! Come back here, bitch. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Fucking come back here with my money! You can run away with my money, is that what you think? Is that what you think, bitch? Think you can run up into the fucking woods with my fucking money? Is that what you think? Is that what you think you can do to me? Well, let's fucking find out, shall we? Let's fucking find out! I'll find you wherever you are, you fucking whore! Come on, babe. You think you can do this to me, do ya? Come back here, you. Hey, bitch! Fuck. Come back here, you fucking whore! You can't fucking get away! Fuck you! Jack! Ann! Jack! Ann. Ann! Jack. Jack tried to kill me. Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. - Wait a minute, wait wait. Jack, where'd he go? Tell me, tell me where he is, what'd he do? I think he's dead on the other side of the force field. He tried to go through with the damn bag! What the hell is going on? What are you doing to me, Ann? Look who's talking. You'd have left me to die in that lake like that poor fucking whore turning into fuck knows what. But the process isn't working, is it, Georgie? Is it, Georgie? Except for you. Except for poor, psycho, schizo little you. It's that, isn't it? It's letting you make the link with them. Take a good look at yourself, Georgie. Take a good look. I am Ann. And if I still know one thing I know that I am not gonna let you go through with your crazy little plan. Screw what's in your head. Screw what's in the lake. You are mine. Georgie. Georgie! Georgie, get away! Go get her! Hey! Oh! With my fingers deactivating. Who are you? Come with me, Ann. Then I can do the rest. And we can finally be together. No one will ever come between us. No one will ever come between us. Die, you bitch. The damn repeater. Georgie. No, not now, damn it. Georgie, Georgie, I activated it. I activated it, I reached the repeater and activated the fucking SOS. So they're gonna come. Hey, hey. They're gonna come, all right, this time. And they're gonna figure out how to turn this fucking thing off. We got to go, we got to meet 'em at the force field. Georgie, we got to. What are you? What? Where's the repeater?
