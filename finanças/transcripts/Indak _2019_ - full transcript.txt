For every beat, I feel each step towards my dreams. Don't hide the things that you can do For many wish to fly To reach for the stars Many put on hold their dreams Never knowing themselves Still searching for something it seems Don't be afraid to make mistakes Don't be afraid to do what you love Till the time comes when you gotta stop If you don't try you'll never know Will it just be until a vision? Don't left them... Judge the way that you live Just put your heart in your passion Why don't you show them what you got? Why don't you show them that you're not what they think you are?

And just take off Just let yourself fly Come with me, let's make a scene Get rid of the old ways you've always been A brand new beat Awaken the mind that's asleep All those dreaming that try to creep in The songs that keep narrow The mind that listens in It doesn't mean the singer's got fame That what you hear sounds genuine Don't be afraid to make mistakes Don't be afraid to do what you love Till the time comes when you gotta stop If you don't try, you'll never know Will it just be until a vision? Don't let them... Judge the way that you live Just put your heart in your passion Why don't you show them what you got? Why don't you show them that you're not what they think you are?

They've been there outside all this time. Aren't we eating yet? I cooked your dinner awhile back. You're late, so just heat it up. I'm sure it's cold by now. Thank you, Mom. You're right. It is late so, please rest up now. Not yet, there's still lots of people. What if it's you who'll get sick instead? Mom getting sick? She's even the one mixing the cures. What if we just limit the number of people coming here? I make enough for the three of us anyway. Don't you worry, child. I'm strong. I'd feel weaker if I know I can't help. You know what, just let mom be. It's what makes her happy. Yeah, I know it's what makes you happy. But Mom, you're getting old as well. Who's old? When you love what you do, you never get tired. You don't even think about your age. Jen... ...you'll realize this once you find what makes you happy. I am happy with what I'm doing. Jen? Tonyo, are you here for mom? Nope. I got an errand. Someone's here to see you. Hey! Oh, so handsome! Who is he? Hi, Jen. Do I know you? Sorry... Sorry for being too forward. I called you "Jen" on the spot. Jennifer, right? I'm Vincent, by the way. But you can call me Vin, if you want. -I'm Adong. -Hi. The brother of Jen. I'm sorry about this one. She seems tired, that's why she's out of it. I'm KC. Girl, your turn. Shake! What do you need from me? Is it okay if we talk? We're already talking. Not that. I mean, just the two of us. Just tell me what you have to here, I'm gonna tell them anyway. Okay. I'm here to give you an offer. Because based on what I saw, I think you really have potential. What potential? You don't know? Here, watch this. What's that? Do you need an Internet connection? There's no signal here. However, the signal is stronger where the boat is docked. Just find a spot. -Over there? -Yes, signal's strong there. Let's go. Okay. -Watch this. -Where is it? That's my sister! That's my sister! What the heck is that? Let me see. Tonyo, give that to me. Here, watch it, sister. We could use someone like you in our team, Jen. Where can we watch you? Do you appear on TV shows? Yes. But mostly online. Just search for our group, Indak Pinas. So you're saying I can watch my best friend on TV? Yeah. Our competition in Korea will be televised. Isn't Jen pretty enough... ...to be featured on TV? Well, we are dancers. It's not like we're celebrities. No, you didn't answer! Jen, he said you're ugly! No, she not. She's pretty. Adong, didn't I tell you to fix this door? Is it still broken? Hey, KC! Why aren't you home yet? Hasn't Auntie been looking for you? It hurts. "151 days before competition" Jen. Jen, just hear me out. Just listen to what I've gotta say about our group. Okay, look. I'm part of Indak Pinas. All of the members each have their own dance specialty. Different kinds of talent, but we dance as one. We're from different parts of the Philippines and... ...we're very proud to represent the Islands of the Philippines. We're going to compete in South Korea. We've been to different places. I'm not interested. I only want to be here. This is my world. Here in Bantayan. But Jen, the world is big. Bigger than this faraway island. Faraway island? Far from where? It probably is, based on where you came from. But I belong here. This isn't far. Anyway, I gotta go to work. Have you eaten breakfast, son? Come on. Let's go in. Have a seat. You know, Jen... When she was still young, she was really into dancing. Then during a performance, she fell off the stage. She was hurt and got laughed at. She was so humiliated. She never danced again after that? Not in front of other people. There was a time that I'd catch her dancing in front of the mirror. And when she sees me, she'd freeze. That's why it's hard for her to talk about what you want. I just... I want to help her. Her talent shouldn't be hidden. I know you can help her... ...achieve that dream that she's been holding back. You believe in me? You know, Jen's sickness... ...is the only sickness I can't heal. It's one bad memory that I can't easily remove. And you, too, son... ...I cannot heal your sickness. Sorry? That sickness etched in your heart. Once you are healed... ...you can open it again for other people and things... ...that can give you happier memories. She's went to the sea alone. Will she be okay by herself? Don't you worry. She's built for the sea. She's saved many lives out there. And as for you, if you join her... ...and then something happens... ...she might be the one to save you. Hey, Jen, when you get famous, don't forget us. What if all of a sudden you'll leave us? You won't even say goodbye. You think I'll replace all of this? This place is paradise. Don't deny it. I remember when all you wanted to do was to dance. Why don't you pursue dancing in Manila? Think about it, Jennifer. Since we were kids up until now... ...all we eat are scallops and aged sugar cane for drinking. Am I right? Are you certain that you don't want something different? What about mom? What about Adong? Come on, Jen, what you worried about? I'm here anyway. Plus, you know what Apo Obang wants for you, right? She's right. Apo's dream for you is to keep dancing, right? What if I'm the one who messed it up? What if I'm not good enough? You can do it, Jen. Think about it. Your stage fright will eventually disappear. And Vin's support is there for you. There you go! That's what she really wants to hear. That Vin will be there. Jen, if you really don't want to do it, talk to him, instead of ignoring him. Come on, let's have a shot. Hi, Jen. Let's go. Go where? Well, I'm your only passenger today. -Get lost. -What was that? Anyway, I'm a tourist now. I heard you're the best and the bravest tour guide in Bantayan. And I'm no good in the open sea water. So can you give me a tour? Let's go. Let's go for a swim. The water looks nice. Go ahead. Come on. Let's go, come on. Come on. Come on. Hey! What happened? I was stung by a jellyfish! Just pee on it! Is there no other way? None. You just need to pee on it. I thought you swim a lot? Just go there and pee on it. Okay fine, I'll do it. Do it quick. Funny, huh? You should smile more. Jen! Jen, is this yours? Hey! Hey, wait! This is old school. The night is young The sun's setting I'll be cruising to a place Where I can get lost Looking for myself In a complete paradise Oh, forget about all the drama Maybe you wanna come with? I'm convinced you're right here 'Coz your dream's coming true Let's get lost tonight From the city of lights Hear the music, feel the rhythm Let's get lost tonight Livin' the life 24-7 The beat is droppin' Every millisecond Life ain't stoppin' Stoppin' 24-7 The beat is droppin' Droppin' Every millisecond Life ain't stoppin' Stoppin' 24-7 The beat is droppin' I've been here a few times. My first time here, I was too young then. A long time ago. But now, I'm on vacation. I'm staying at the resort next door... ...when I learned and saw your video. It was timely. So I asked around for you. It wasn't that hard to find your place. Your mother's popular around here. There's something really special about this place. You're right. Like they said, once you've experienced Bantayan, you'll always come back for more. But I really don't want to leave this place. I'm happy here. Aside from chasing your dreams... ...and going places... ...you'll get a chance to win the grand prize, too. Maybe you can use that for your family. Your mother's getting old, you know. -Maybe she could use the money. -My mom is still young. She's still in good shape. All right then. But Apo Obang wants you to continue dancing, right? This is your opportunity. You can do what you love. And you can support your mom. I know you believe in faith. But sometimes... ...you need to take action. This? Is this it? Not all questions have answers waiting. No matter how you prepare... ...if the thunderstorm comes, things that are not planned still happens. If we only had the power to foresee tomorrow... ...if these would be the consequences... ...I wish I had changed the course of fate. Jen? Jennifer. I'm not sure if I can do it, Mom. Jen. The world needs to see your spark. But what about you? If I'm the obstacle in reaching for your dreams, that will surely make me sad. Look at this. When you were still young... ...you already knew what you wanted. I know that you're happy when you're dancing. When you were just 10 years old... ...you saved a kid from drowning. Do you remember that? At a young age, you are already brave. Where's that brave girl now? Jen? But Mom... ...what about you here? Will you be okay? So long as you're happy, I'm happy. I'm terrified, Mom. As long as you wear that amulet... ...then I'm just by your side. Whatever new things you'll learn... ...don't ever forget where you came from. And who you truly are. In an instant... ...I was swept away by a giant wave. At first, it was terrifying. I felt like drowning. The huge buildings seemed like giant mountains. The vehicles were loud. Everything glared. But amid all this loudness, I still felt a bit of calm. Just slow down and flow along. "117 Days Before Competition" Come inside. Vin, I will stay at your house? It's okay. The condo has got two rooms. Your parents? Where are they? I'm embarrassed, I might get in the way. I live alone here at the condo. My parents are busy with our pharma business. So they trust me being alone here. Don't stress out. All right. Go to your room so you can rest. I'll introduce you to everyone. Okay. Oh, my God, Vin, you're back! Guys, I'd like you all to meet Jen. Jen, this is Steph. She's one of the best ones here. Hi, Jen! Finally! It's nice to meet you. Where are you from again? Where's that pretty island we saw from the video? That's in Bantayan. Me, from Mactan! Don't be shy, you're welcome here. -Hi, Jen. -Hello. Jen, this is Simon and this is Carmel. Over here's our DJ. He will be mixing all our music. Oh, child! I'm DJ! Well, anyway, right there, I play music, I mix tape. And I do beatbox like this. Okay, that's enough. Don't mind him, Jen. Herminio's his real name, by the way. Lucky you. We have a lot of members here in Indak, but not everyone gets to compete. And Vin, being our leader, thinks you're the perfect fit for the role. All of us here worked so hard to qualify and get to the semis. So you have a big shoe to fill, my dear. Well, duh! Jen can do it, right, Jen? Fine. Can you show us what you got? Actually, I wanna see your dance on the boat. Here's the thing. Since we're already prepared... -...why don't we dance instead? -Yeah, why not? Let's introduce ourselves to her through dance. Yeah! That's right. All right? All right, let's go. DJ! Hey! Let's go! Stay here and watch. Hey, what do you think? You think Jen will last? You're nuts! What if she's just really shy? Well, maybe, she's not used to group performances. -That's it. Right? -Right. -Want some water? -Okay. Let's go back inside. -Break's not over. -Break. Okay, guys, let's start. Tempo! Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three and four. And five and six, seven and eight. And one and two and three and four, five and six, seven, eight. Boom, let's go. All right, let's call it a day. See you tomorrow, same time. Hey. You're still practicing? You should rest now. I couldn't keep up at practice awhile ago. It's understandable. Vin, it's embarrassing though, so much time wasted, and then... ...what if they're upset about me? Are you referring to Steph? No, not Steph. It's just really embarrassing. Okay. Well, since you're practicing now, you want me to join you? I can guide you. Tell me where it's hard for you, then, let's work on those moves. Really? Of course. Let's do it. Okay. Game. Five, six, seven, eight. That's it. When you get here... Ready? Then lean back. And six, and seven, eight! Okay. Did I do it correctly? Wrong step then? No. No, nothing. -Exactly like that. -Like? It's good. Are you okay? Don't mind me. I'm just tired. Sorry, Vin, I'm tiring you out. Jen. You have to stop saying sorry. I'm really okay. You know what? It's kinda late. We got an early start tomorrow. Let's call it a night. Good night. I'll go ahead One, two, three, four, five, six... Oh, my God! Jen, are you okay? What the...? Watch where you're going. Are you okay, Jen? I'm okay. -Come on, guys, from the top. -All right, let's go. Carry on. -From the top, guys. -Okay. Nice one, guys! Hey, guys. Let's go on lunch break. Be back in an hour. -Let's go! -Let's eat... Beef broth! Beef broth! Come on, game! Maybe Jen's lonely, Mom. When do you think she'll be back? Perhaps she's already adjusted to Manila by now. And I'm pretty sure everyone's blown away by how good she is! Mom? Are you okay? I'm all right, son. Let's eat. Have a seat, Mom. Oh, gosh! It's almost Jen's birthday! Here in the city... ...we all have the same dreams. We may train differently... ...but it all came from one thing. Our passion in dancing. Through dancing... ...we can forget about the world. You can mask the noise with music. Every motion... ...every step... ...either with a group... ...or a partner... ...even when you're alone. Time just flies by. Days just pass by. But you never get tired. Most of us came from different places. But we share a common dream. And that is to dance at the world's grandest stage. That's the reason why I'm here. For now, this is my stage. We dance to laugh. We dance to our fears. We dance for madness... ...for tears. We dance for love. We dance for hope. We dance like no one is watching. Guys, guys! Isn't it cold in Korea now? So we better bring winter clothes, right? Rej, I'm broke as hell. I gotta send money to my mother back home. I'm strapped, too. Papa hasn't wired funds from Saudi. He looks down on me dancing, so who knows. Well, all of us here, we're all doing this for the love of dancing, right? God knows why Steph chose a fancy place again. Are you paying for this? -So we're not ordering yet, guys? -That's right. This water's been making me full already. -Where the heck is Vin anyway? -Good question. He's always late now. He wasn't like that before. It's been two months since I moved to Manila. So much has changed. There are things that you don't notice, while there are things that others notice. Are these changes all for the better... ...or for the fate to get worse? We wanna thank, of course, Steph, for all the help. City Hall has confirmed their support on our group. We're all going to Korea! Yes. Oh, my God. I'm so excited. I can't wait to try Korean food. Hey, Bro, what's up? Yo, Vincent, what's up, man? It's Bill. Is Indak Pinas good to go for the flash mob proposal for Anna? This is actually a really bad time. I'm in the middle of a business meeting with... ...with my mom and dad, so... Really? Thought I heard people celebrating there. Anyways, send my regards to Abby and Fred. Yeah. All right, I'll see you later. All right, see you, man. Bye. Vin. What was that you said about a business meeting? It's nothing. Excuse me. As for me, if I win this, I'm upgrading my face. Whose face are you cloning then? Hey, he's a looker. That'll do. "World Dance Competition Korea" The next team is from India... ...the Raanee Rebels! "Raanee Rebels India" Just dance... ...when you can't find the words. Just move when you feel like everything has stopped. Just groove. When life challenges you, don't give up. Here, it's fresh. Good. Hello? Hello? -Hello? -Tonyo. -It's Jen. -Hey, Jen! -Happy birthday! -Thank you. How are you? Why did you just call now? Tonyo, can you go to mom? Are you nearby? Are they around? Yeah, surely. One second. -Dong! Adong! -Yes! It's your sister! Go get Apo! Go on, bring mom here. Hurry! Wait a minute. They're coming. -Jen. -Adong. How are you there? How's mom? We miss you! Cindy's calling mom. Happy birthday, Jen! Thank you, Dong. We're about to go to Korea. If we win... ...I'll send something for you and mom. Jen, don't cry now. You're gonna make mom cry, too. Also, you're so ugly when you cry! Okay, mom's here. -Mom. -Jen. -It's Jen. -Jen. How are you? Happy birthday! Thank you, Mom. I miss you. We miss you, too. How's your life there in Manila? Mom, I'm sorry if I don't always call you. But Mom, we will go to Korea soon. I can finally reach my dreams. Jane's going to Korea. Our dreams. Happy birthday, Jen! Oh, no! What did you do? You're so clumsy! -Sis? Jen? -Jen? -She's gone. -She's gone? She's gone? Stupid! Guys, I think we need to unwind. I gotta go somewhere for a while. You should join them. I gotta encash some checks. Trust. This what I learned here in the city. "Rue Bourbon" Cheers! Hey guys! Guys! Wait! I have something to tell you. I had just checked our applications, and today is Jen's birthday! Oh, my God! There are those that with one look at them, you know you'll get along with them. They are the type of people that you can easily trust. It's as if... ...you knew them for a very long time. It's all fun, all relaxed mood. And nothing to worry about. You feel safe because you're with them. Is it really your birthday today? Why didn't you say anything? It's all cool. Don't worry. Let's go dance! Wait. Hello? Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. I just need to take this call outside, okay? I'll leave my bag here. The money's all there. Please keep it safe. I'll be back. Are you okay here? But whatever you do and how much you're in control, there are people who's main goal is to take advantage of others. It's hard to trust. Because a little mistake will change everything. Jen, are you okay? -Where's the bag? -Jen? Jen, are you okay? You stay here, I'll find help. -Jen? -Stay here. Are you okay, Jen? Jen! Jen! Fred? What are you doing here? Emergency meeting, right? All the OG members of Indak should be here. What happened? The money. All the funds. It got stolen. What? It's the new member's fault, Fred. Stop the blame game, Steph. It's all clear Jen had no fault in it! How did the money get stolen? Could we answer that first? They said it's an ongoing modus. Maybe they just sighted Jen randomly. We can never tell. Maybe she's one of them. -Steph! -Enough, Steph! Stop defending her because I know that you know I'm right! What's not right is your attitude! You're the one who wanted to party in the first place! Enough already! Pointing fingers won't solve anything! You think we'll ever get that money back? Say goodbye to that 500,000! Korea starts in three weeks, guys! I don't understand why am I the only one who's panicking? Steph! Stop it. Okay? You're not helping. Don't start with me, Vin. Am I the only one who's not helping here? Guys, Steph has a point. Jen was targeted because she's so naive! She became the victim... ...and so did our money. 'Cause she's just plain stupid! -How dare you say that? -Guys, calm down. -Real talk, dude. -What did you say? Oh, my God! Stop it! Please stop blaming Vin! It's really my fault! I'm sorry. I don't know how to return the money, but please, stop fighting. Do any of you realize what's happening here? Indak's spirit is lost. What happened to the team that promised to stick together... ...through thick and thin? Did you forget about that? We're only humans. Why don't we just find a way? -We all have weaknesses. -Why don't we put up crowd-funding? -We commit mistakes. -Forget our pride. -That's right. -But what's important... -Guys, I'm sorry this happened. -...is we learn from them. -Nobody wanted this to happen. -I will do everything... We will do everything... So nobody should be blaming anybody. If there is no understanding, there is no connection. If there is no respect... ...there is no love. And if trust is gone... -...there are no reason to move on. -Indak... ...Pinas!

After all the things we've done... ...somehow we're still short. Indak Pinas is getting desperate. We're running out of ideas. Until someone recalled an old plan. This is the offer of Bill, one of Vin's closest friend. Wasn't there a flash mob proposal? Remember, Vin? Bill's proposal? Didn't he say he's willing to spend for all of us? -Do we really need that? -Definitely! I think it's a good idea. Just because it reminds you of weddings, you have to drag us down? Steph. There is no end on the road to triumph. There's always something to fix. Sometimes it's dark, dangerous... ...and it will test your strength within. The question is... ...how far can you go? How long is your patience? Every minute, every hour. How long can you dance?

One beat... ...one rhythm... ...one dance... ...until next time. When I was still young, Mama would tell me I'm a good dancer. She said when the right time comes... ...this would be the key to achieving my dreams. No matter how many times I fell... ...no matter how many times I lost faith in myself... ...you were always there for me. Giving me courage of heart... ...giving me hope. Jen, don't be sad. It's no big deal. But why did it turn out this way? Why do you have to leave? It should've been me. She's built for the sea. She's saved many lives out there. And if you join her... ...and something happens... ...she will be the one saving you. When you were just 10 years old... ...you saved a kid from drowning. Do you remember that? This is your time now. Don't ever give up. Sail away... ...as far as you can. I love you so much. I'm sorry. I'm a dancer. I don't dance because I like to. But because I need to. I'm able to tell stories through action and movement. I dance not just because I like to... ...but because I feel happy doing it. You just have to keep on dreaming. As they all say... ...dancing is like letting yourself go. But it's also a way for you to see where you're going. And who you really are. Indak Pinas! Now, I finally know you, Jen. Thank you, mom. Because of you I braved the waves of life. That's why whatever storm will come... ...I know you're just beside me... ...dancing with me through the challenges of life. Just like what you've told me, to just hang on. Groove. And never let go. One beat... ...one rhythm... ...one dance. Welcome, Indak Pinas. Hello. Hello, hi. Hello, hello. Hello, guys, hi. -Hello. -Hi. I love you too. Okay, welcome, welcome, guys. Okay, maybe that it's time to show us your performance. Yeah, perform in our country. Yes, Philippines!
