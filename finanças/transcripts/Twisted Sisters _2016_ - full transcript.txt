- I mean, did you see the dress she had on? - No, I couldn't see past her hideous new bangs. Here. Damn, who's red shirt over there? So cute, right? Why are your pants still on? Get them off. Get over here. God, I'm gonna be sick. - No, no, you're good. - No, get off... God... God. - Thanks for wasting my time! , man. - Hey, Jill, can you come pick me up? Bye, sluts! Mwuah! See you later. Bye, party people! Jill! My favorite bitch. Hey, cute pajamas. Cute shirt. - Another fun Friday night? - I don't want to talk about it. - You know, someday, you're gonna have to think about your future. - I'm only 16; I think I can go a little longer without having one. - Just saying. I worry about you. - Look, dude, next year you'll be off in your Ivy League tower and getting a fancy-ass degree and... you won't have to worry about your screw-up little sister. - Hey, you are not a screw-up. But you are a throw-up. Thanks for picking me up, Jill. - Anytime, kiddo. - Hey, look. - Ooh. Kay? Well, you have good timing. We're almost there. You want to, um, grab some lunch after we unload everything? - I have a lot to do. - Right. My gosh. Look. That's Psi Kappa, that's my old sorority house. - You were a sorority girl? - Yeah. - You never told me that. - Well... I don't tell you everything. I used to be pretty cool. - I see. Hi. Hi! - Hey. Sorry. I'm Jodi. I'm Jodi. You must be Sarah. Or the RA coming to give me a noise citation on day one. - The former. - Score. I promise I won't be one of those clich√© bad roommates who always plays her music too loud. - No, it's okay, actually, I like Syntax, so. - Really? - Good, yeah. - Did you see their show at Wrighton Hall last year? Mind blowing. - No, I don't really go to concerts too much. It's just good music to program to, you know. - You're a programmer? Very cool. I, myself, am an aspiring comedy writer, as you might be able to tell by my sharp wit. - Anyway, um, I will get out of your way and we'll catch up later, cool? - Yeah, sure. Hi. - Hi. - I'm Alice, I'm... I'm Sarah's mom. - Hey Sarah's Mom, I'm Jodi. Hello. - This is exciting. - Yeah. - I think you guys... you guys are gonna be friends. It's gonna be great... - Mom. Chill out. - Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go. It was really nice to meet you. - You too. Well... this is the last of it. One more thing. Um, lovely young girl in the hallway gave me this. Very flattering. - Just one Psi Kappa event. Please, for me? - Man, you've been plugged in all day. So they're having this floor party so everyone can get to know each other; do you want to go? - No thanks. Yeah, no, me neither, I hate awkward social mixers. Um, I'm gonna go to a meeting for the improv troupe tomorrow. Kind of dreading it. Are you gonna join the computer club or something? - No, I actually have this sorority rush thing I have to go to tomorrow. - Ha-ha. Wait, are you serious? - Yeah. - I... I'm sorry, you just don't strike me as the type. And that is a compliment. I mean, those girls are all about getting wasted, laid, and, if they could count to three, they'd probably add something else to the list. - Yeah, it's not really my scene either, or... not anymore, but my mom's really big about me going so I'm just going to tell her I went. I'm not gonna pledge or athing like that. - Hey! Is this the line just to get into the event? - Are you sure you're in the right place? - Kind of hard to misread the giant sign. - It's a really competitive year. They can't fit everybody in the house at once so they're admitting us in groups. It may take a while so... maybe you just want to come back later. - Screw this. - Hey! Where are you going? - I was just leaving. - Why? Did you change your mind? - Not exactly. Look, my mom went here and she really wanted me to check it out. So I've checked it out. - Wait. You're a legacy? Well then, why didn't you say so? Just come on in. - Are you sure? I mean, these girls have been waiting forever and they're all dressed up. - Daisy hates it when they wear our colors to rush events. She thinks it's really tacky. - Right. And who's Daisy? - At the end of the day, these thoughtful care packages will be delivered to our sorority charity: The Waynes County Domestic Violence Center, a refuge for women who have suffered both physical and emotional trauma and who are looking to move past their dark pasts and into a brighter future. These gifts are designed to encourage and to empower these women. Because that is what being a Psi Kappa is all about. It's about learning to stay strong and to stand tall and carve out our futures in the face of any adversity. Thank you for your contributions, ladies. Thank you. Whitney, send in the next group. - Daisy. Come. This is Daisy. Daisy is our sorority president. Daisy, meet Sarah. Sarah is a legacy. But she's not really sure if it's for her, so... - I just don't really thi... - Don't ever be ashamed to think for yourself, Sarah. It's a quality that we admire here. Tell me, why did you come to college? - Well, to learn, actually, to lay the groundwork for my career. - And what is your perspective on sororities? Come on, be honest. We've all heard stories. So why do you think it is that so many girls want to be in a sorority? They're trying to fill deep inner voids with sex, drugs, and alcohol, comfortably surrounded by other girls with equally deep inner voids. Deep inner voids. I like that. And you're right about most. But that's why Psi Kappa's unlike other sororities. You see, they treat college like a playground. And we like to think of it as a... As a training ground. What would you say if I told you that I was first in my class, followed closely by Maria here, our VP, that my goal is to be the first female president? And Maria's going to be the best public defender this state has ever seen? - I'd say you guys are definitely driven. - The events and parties... To a Psi Kap, these are all just a means to an end. And if you have an end in mind, a goal that you're working towards, then we can help you get there. Psi Kap opens doors. You mentioned that you want to build a career. In what? - Computer programming, actually. I want to found my own start-up and create software that really helps people. - Well, we are all about helping people. I like to say that in order to do better, you have to be better. And Psi Kaps are the best. So come on, let's get you a seat at the table. - Follow me. - It was lovely meeting you, Sarah. I would tell you to think about it, but I already know that you think for yourself. - Thanks, Daisy. I had a really nice time tonight. - Good, I'm glad. Now, get home safe. Whitney. Whitney! What have I told you about smoking in public? - All the freshman are gone so... - No, what have I told you about smoking in public? - That it makes me look ugly, which makes Psi Kap look ugly. - And yet here you are during rush week when we're supposed to be looking our absolute best sucking back that cancer-stick like the white trash you've worked so hard to get away from. - I am so sorry, Daisy. It won't happen again. - Do you know what a good mother does when she catches her daughter sneaking candy? She makes that little girl eat the entire pack till she gets so sick that she never wants to eat another piece again. - Y... you want me to smoke the whole pack? - Eat it. There you go. That's a good girl. How many are left? - Ten. - I hope you had a light lunch. - Daisy! Please. I'm kidding. I'm not gonna make you eat the whole pack. What am I, some kind of monster? - Yeah, they're like, intense but they don't fit the dumb-blonde stereotype at all. - I mean, I would never generalize with stereotypes. I'm sure you met a lot of dumb brunettes and dumb redheads too. What, are you really thinking of pledging now? - No, no, I mean, there were like a hundred other girls waiting to get in so I doubt I can get a bid anyways. What are you watching? - I'm just brushing up on my "Captain Quantica" before the new season starts. - Never seen it. - What? You've never seen "Captain Quantica?" - No. - Well, this injustice must be rectified. Leave your sorority woes behind and take a journey with me, dear roomie, into the future. Here. - Kay, next we have Erin Simpson. - The cool, hot lesbian. Loved her. Plus, we score points with the gay community. - So all in favor of inviting Erin to pledge? Next up, Sarah Marsh. I thought she was great. She's a nerd. - Okay. Well. All in favor of inviting Sarah to pledge? - Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I'm disappointed. You need to learn to see past the obvious. Sarah was a beautiful butterfly that just crawled back into the cocoon. There's a strong girl in there, we just need to help her break her shell. And maybe she's a real nerd, but frankly I see that as untapped territory if we're expanding our influence on campus. What makes Psi Kap the best? None the same, all together. - That's right. So I humbly recommend that we reconsider this decision. All in favor of inviting Sarah to pledge? - What's going on out there? - "Miss Sarah Marsh, you have been granted the distinct honor of a bid to pledge Psi Kappa." - We're taking that crap down. Soon as I wake up. - This course is filed under "Computer Programming," but, in truth, it's equally an art class. Creation is your primary task this semester. Here you'll be learning how to change the way people live through technology. All right, that's it for today, guys. Stay connected. - Professor Kent. I'm Sarah Marsh. - Marsh? I don't remember that name on my roster. - Well, I'm not on your roster. I was placed in Professor Graham's section, but I want to be in yours. - Professor Graham is a fine teacher. - Yeah, but based on what I read about you on the Teacher Score website, you're the best and I need the best. - Miss... - Marsh. - Marsh, I applaud your enthusiasm, but I don't make exceptions. I teach an advanced class to juniors and seniors. So he said he'd probably see me later. - So you can just take that class in a couple years, right? - No, that's not the point, Mom, I mean, I don't need to be a junior or senior to take this class, I'm ready to take it now. - Okay, I'm sorry. - So... They asked me to pledge. - That's great. My gosh. Honey, I'm proud of you. That's good news that you're making fri... - I haven't decided if I'm gonna actually take the bid yet, all right? - Okay, what's holding you back? - I don't know, as much as Psi Kap's not like other sororities, it's still just a big social distraction, you know? I wish I could ask her what to do. She always gave the best advice. - Sweetie, um, Jill wasn't worried about you socializing. She was worried about you standing still. I think if you pledge this sorority, it's a confident step towards your future. - All right. And Mom, thanks for the computer. You didn't have to do that. - Well, sweetie, you deserve it. - All right, love you. No. My God. - I am so sorry. - No-no-no-no, I wasn't looking where I was going. I'm sorry. - Psi Kap? I am not worthy. - Their reputation that bad? - no, they... they pretty much run the school. You must be pretty special if they're asking you to pledge. - I don't know about that. - Just don't forget the clumsy track guy that almost ran you down before you're famous. Okay, Sarah? Your name's on the invitation. - Right, kay, sorry. - I'm Liam. - I'm Sarah. Hi. - Yeah, you're only on Book Three? - That's embarrassing. - You have a lot of catching up to do. - Thanks. - Happy pledging, Sarah. - Happy running. Runner's ass. - Hi, I'm Erin. - Hi, Sarah, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Any idea what we're in for tonight? - No idea. The Psi Kaps are super secretive. - Congratulations. Amongst over 100 applicants, you lucky, young women have been chosen to pledge Psi Kappa. Take a look around at these walls. You will be joining a sisterhood that has given rise to some of the greatest female leaders this country has ever seen. From senators to CEOs, Psi Kaps carry their traditions from this very room and into the real world. Your first task tonight will be to pick a Psi Kap hero from amongst our prestigious alumni. She will serve as your guiding light, your role model, and, if you're lucky, your real-life mentor. So, please, pick a hero, write her name below yours, then fold your paper and place it in the pledge box. - Who's that? - It's my mom. God, she looks so much like my sister. - What does she do? We don't seem to have anything listed about her accomplishments. - My dad works in banking and Mom raised the kids. - I see. You know what, I have something that I want to show you. - Is that... Kendall Lighton? The founder of Northrotech was a Psi Kap? - No, Kendall Lighton is a Psi Kap, for life till death. And if you write her down as your Psi Kap hero, you may just get a chance to meet her. All right. Very nice, ladies. Now I am going to take you up to the sacred room. Our final bonding exercise is a bit more serious. This house, these walls, they have kept the secrets of every sister since the foundation of this sorority. Secrets can bring us together and secrets can tear us apart. Secrets have power. So tonight, as the final step of your initiation, we ask that you share your deepest, darkest secret with the group. Only once you've revealed yourself before the sisterhood can you truly trust and accept one another. - I didn't cut very deep. Actually, as soon as I saw the blood, I passed out. Um... and thankfully I woke up with a clear head and I realized that I wanted to live. And, um, I promised that I'd never let a bully get to me again. - Good for you, Erin. Thank you for sharing. Sarah, you're next. 'Bout two years ago, I was in a car accident. Um, my sister, Jill, she was driving and she died. - Sarah, this is a safe space. Please, open yourself to your sisters. - Well, after the accident, um, I took some time off school, and I never really told anyone this, but... I... I kind of had a nervous breakdown. They had to put me in the hospital for awhile to recover. It was a really, a really dark time in my life. So I, I disappeared into my computer. Something about programming made me feel better. Felt, like, more in control, I guess. Like I could turn pain into productivity. Eventually I bounced back and decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and start moving forward. - A strong woman learns from her trials and comes through the fire stronger. You've clearly done that, Sarah. I'm so proud of you. - I, Sarah Marsh, pledge to uphold the values of Psi Kappa. This house is my home and these women my family. I will never betray another sister. Psi Kap for life. Psi Kap till death. - Welcome to Psi Kap, little sister. And now that you're all family, you will spend your first night sleeping here, in the chapter room, dreaming of your bright, new futures. Sleep well, ladies. Good morning, Sarah. How did you sleep? - Pretty good, actually, considering I haven't used a sleeping bag in about ten years. - Well, when you move into the house, you'll have your own room and your own bed. - Is that required? - No, it's not required, but it's strongly encouraged. - It's just that my dorm is covered under my financial aid, and I can't really afford the extra housing costs. - No, I understand. But just make sure that any downtime that you do have, you spend it at home with your sisters. And our coffee should be here by now. - From where? Sorry, sorry, morning practice ran late. - It's fine. Kevin, this is Sarah. Sarah's our new recruit. - Hey, Sarah, congrats. - Kevin. - Yeah? - This doesn't taste skim. - stupid! My gosh, I'm sorr... I'll take it back for you, Daisy. - It's okay. - Okay. - Well, we have places to be. - Yeah, right. Of course, I'm so sorry, I'm holding you guys up. - It's okay. - Have a good day. Yeah, you too.... - Is that your boyfriend or... - No, sweetie, that is just the power of the pin. You know, tell me, Sarah, are you enjoying your classes? - Yeah, they're okay. - Just okay? We don't settle for okay. What's wrong? - Well, I really want to be in Professor Kent's class, but it's for juniors and seniors only, so. - Sarah, you're a Psi Kap now. And Psi Kaps get what Psi Kaps want. - And you would like to be moved from Professor Graham's class to... - Professor Kent's. - Professor Kent. And you are in Professor Kent's class. You just bring him that new roster. - Mrs. Dwyer, you are just the best. You enjoy that cupcake. - I will. - See? Psi Kap opens doors. - Yeah, but some other student just got switched out of that class. - Let me ask you something, okay? Is some other student more deserving of being in Professor Kent's class than you are? - Well, no, it's just... - Good. So then you're getting what you deserve and there's nothing wrong with that, okay? Now, run along, we can't have you being late. - It's great. You can work on it. Miss Marsh. Persistent, aren't we? - Spot opened up. - Lucky for you. Okay, so let's dive right into our pitches for your year-long project: a truly useful application. Shall we start with... I don't know, Sarah? - Really? - For someone so eager to be in this class, I would expect some preparation. - I'm prepared. - Great. What's your pitch? - Well, it's a place to share our thoughts. - Good. Just what the world needs, another digital dumping ground for its collective stream-of-consciousness. - Wouldn't be random thoughts. It'd be things we'd never share on social media. - They why would we share them on your app? - Because I'd made it anonymous and cathartic. See, we're all accustomed to typing our thoughts on social media, but think about how good it feels to actually speak the words, you know, get something off your chest. This app would allow users to speak directly into their phone and reveal their biggest secrets. Then everyone is filtered into the same anonymous voice so that we can all safely listen to each other's secrets without judgment. - Vocal algorithms are a tough nut to crack. - I know, Professor, that's why I'm here to learn. - Very good, Sarah. Let's hope you can. Okay, who else is ready with a pitch? - Dude, I thought you died last night, what happened? - I spent the night at the sorority house. - Boy. You're a full-blown sister now, aren't you? - It's more like being part of a club that has, like, really cool perks, not like I'm one of them. - Gobble gobble gobble gobble. - What? - Nothing. - Can you, like, turn down your music? I'm gonna try to take a nap. - Yes, Miss Psi Kap, anything you say, Miss Psi Kap. - Ha-ha. - This weekend, we will be hosting the Sadie Hawkins dance. For those of you who don't know what that means, it's a reversal of traditional structure. So instead of the men asking the women the women ask the men. Because we have the power. - Who's our brother fraternity? - Well, while most other sororities limit themselves to one group of boys, Psi Kaps actually have the entire university at their disposal. Any guy would be both eager and lucky to have you as their date. But that means you must be discerning. Your choice is not just a reflection on you, but also on your sisters. Meeting adjourned. - Daisy can be kind of intense? Okay. You know, those, those breath mints that's she's always popping? Yeah, well, she empties the box and then she replaces them with diet pills. Damn, no wonder she's so perky. - Yeah. - You want to walk with me? - Sure. - Wait a second. - What? - Do my eyes deceive me? - What? Pop. - Yes, I'm officially a sorority sister now. So I was wondering if those feet of yours do anything other than run in circles. What'd you have in mind? - I don't know, maybe... dancing? - You tell me. - No, no. - No, right? Yeah. But regardless, I was wonder if you weren't busy on Saturday and if you'd like to be my date to this thing... at the house. - You know, I'm not really into the whole Greek scene. - Right, right, of course, I'm sorry for interrupting your run. - But I'm into you. Good line, right? - Yes, very smooth, much like poly-cotton blend. - I would love to be your date for this thing at the house. - All right, awesome. - Sarah, you have got some killer outfits in here. I don't get wh you don't where any of them. - I don't know, I mean, they're more the "old me." And I don't really like the way I was back then. - Look, I understand not wanting to live in the past, but you don't have to leave everything behind you to move forward and anyway, if you're not gonna wear any of these clothes, why do you still have them? They're super cute, right? - Super cute. - Whoa... sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt the makeover montage. - Jodi, this is my big sister, Daisy. - I'm her little roommate. Hey, Sarah, they're screening the premiere of "Captain Quantica" on the quad tonight. You in? - She's busy. - I didn't ask you, Lilly. - It's Daisy. - I have a dance tonight, Jodi. I'm sorry, but maybe next week? - Okay, this is perfect. This... with these shoes. It'll totally show off your figure. - I'm not exactly sure I want my figure on display here. - What, are you kidding me? I would kill to have your curves, trust me. And this Liam boy, he's on the track team, right? - Yeah. - So... he's used to seeing skinny girls who are flat as a surfboard. Got to show him what he's missing in a real woman. And this is the dress to do it, now go try it on. - Okay. - Hey, big sister, why don't you just let Sarah be herself? - These are her clothes. I'm just helping her to be her best self. Friggin' sorority girls. - Look, Jodi, I know what you think of me, that all girls like me look down on girls like you, that we make fun of you, and that we judge you, talk about you behind your back, but that's just simply not true. - It isn't? - No. That's just your own sad fantasy when I actually give a... about you. The truth is I wouldn't waste a second of my time judging you because you are of absolutely no consequence to me or the world at large. You simply don't matter. So keep your clever, little quips to yourself because you are the only one who's listening. - I think I love it. - Of course you do, it's fabulous. - I'm sorry... I don't know what her deal is. - You don't need to apologize for other people, okay? I'm just sorry you have to live in such a toxic environment. Hey, let's not worry about that tonight, right? Shall we do makeup? - Sure. - Kay. - Wow. You look well. Sorry, did I not dress right? - No, you look... You look great, actually - Well, this must be Liam. So nice to meet you. - Yeah, thanks for having me. - Yeah. Maybe you know Kevin? He plays football. Maybe you two have bumped into each other in the locker room. - Um... I generally try to avoid running into people in the locker room. - Sarah, he is funny. What do you bench, bro? - You know what, how about you two go grab us some drinks? - Okay. - Let's go. - Poor boy is dumb as dirt but he is loyal and I owe him a favor. - So you take him to a Psi Kap event 'cause it helps his reputation. - Catching on, Sarah. Everything has value. You just have to learn how to exploit it. - Daisy, I want you to meet Claire. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. - So nice to meet you. Sorry for ruining the girl-ask-boy tradition. - Hey, nonsense. Traditions were made to be broken. - Yeah, they really are. This place is so beautiful by the way. Our house hasn't even got a backyard. - Your house? - Yeah, I'm pledging Gamma Gamma. - You know what, excuse me, I'll be back. - O... kay. - Maria, Maria. May I speak with you? - Yeah? What's up? - What's up is that Erin brought some Gamma girl to our party. A member of our rival sorority in our own backyard. - Okay, well, I'm sure she didn't reali... - She betrayed the sisterhood. - We... we'll talk to her about it tomorrow... - No, I think we should talk about it tonight. - Okay, look, there's no sense in making a scene right now and ruining the party. - You're right. No sense in ruining the party. I need you to do something for me. - How we doing? - Pretty good. Come on. - What is going on? My God. This was all just some big Gamma prank, wasn't it? - What? - Had to get close to our pledge to humiliate her and defile our house? - I didn't. Erin, I didn't! - Get her out. - Erin, I didn't do anything. - Get her out now. - I didn't do anything! Erin, please! Erin, please! Erin, I didn't do anything, please! Mean girls everywhere. - Help. Someone help me, please. Please, help me. Help! Please, help me. - It was terrible. - It was horrible. - I know. Other houses can just be so caddy and close-minded. - How's Erin? - Well, I stayed up talking with her for most of the night, and that she decided that the best thing would be for her to leave school. - You know, she has a history with this kind of bullying, and she just, she really wants to get away from it all. She's really shaken up. - God, poor girl. She's lucky she had you to talk her through it... - Stop, come on, that's what sisters are there for. But, you know, every cloud has a silver lining. - What do you mean? - Well, Erin had paid her dues through the end of the year. Unfortunately for her, they're non-refundable, but fortunately for you, we have an empty room, fully paid for. - So I could move into the house. - Like I said, silver lining. - They're waiting for you, Daisy. - No pressure, okay? Just, I want you to think about where you want your home to be and the people you want to surround yourself with. Think about it, sweetie. - You forgot something. - What? - Your dignity. But I guess you're leaving that behind too? - See, this is exactly why I'm moving out. You create such a toxic environment here. - she really has brainwashed you. This isn't you, Sarah. - Look, you don't know me, Jodi, so why don't you just leave me alone? - You're right. I don't know you. I don't think I want to. - There she is. Sisters, let's welcome Sarah into her new home, where she belongs. - Psi Kap for life. Psi Kap till death. - Wake up call and will show me whether or not you're able to handle the workload moving forward. - The alumni mixer is one of the most important networking events of the year. This is where you will meet the successful women that came out of the house, as well as the heroes that you selected during pledge week. Do not underestimate the importance of this event, ladies. This is where you will lay the groundwork for your future. So don't screw it up. - I mean, I'm actually gonna get to meet Kendall Lighton, like how cool is that? - Very cool. You know Kendall and I were sisters together. - Wow, really? - Yeah. Really. I'm looking forward to seeing her again. But, you know, of course, mostly you. Hey, can we grab dinner beforehand? Just the two of us to catch up? I don't think I have anything to wear. - What? - You're not exactly invited. - It says it's a an alumni mixer. - It is, it's just more of like a business networking thing and Daisy only invited certain alumni. - I see. - But I can ask if you can come, I mean, it's totally... It's not a big deal. - No, no-no-no. Please, who would want to network with a housewife? - Mom, ju... - It's okay, honey. You go, have fun. I have a lot to do here anyway, so... Bye. - Miss Lighton. Hi, I'd like to introduce you to Sarah Marsh. She's the brightest computer programmer in our school. I'll leave you two ladies to talk. - I actually just write code, but I aspire to be a computer programmer. - Sarah Marsh. Your mother isn't Alice Marsh, is she? - She is, actually. - She here tonight? I'd love to catch up. See what she's doing with that finance degree. - No, no, she's not. She's, um, working late. But you know how that is. - Do I ever. So you're a coder? - How are your classes going? - They're going well, actually, you know, college is rough, still trying to find that balance. - Grades are the first thing I look at in any potential employee, regardless of whose niece, second cousin, or sorority sister it is. So you keep up the work. - Thank you, Miss Lighton, it was wonderful to meet you. Thank you. - You have a great idea, Sarah, but it's not going to execute itself. - Look, I know I'm a little behind, but I think I've almost cracked the algorithm. I just... It's hard to find time to plug in. - Well, your school work should be your focus. Everything else should be hard to find time for. - The school work is my focus. I... I mean, it was, I just... - What's going on with you? You came into this class guns blazing, and lately it's been this steep decline and I can't help but think it has something to do with that shiny pin of yours. Look, I've heard sorority stories. I know they have their own set of priorities, but you need to figure out your priorities if you want to succeed. And I care about your success, Sarah. - Okay. I'll do better. - Good. I'll look forward to it. - Hey, the business school mixer's in an hour. - I'm actually gonna have to skip tonight. - You... you're gonna skip an event? - It's just I'm so behind on this project and I really need to catch up. - You seem stressed. Talk to me. - Well, Professor Kent kind of stressed me out today. You know, my grades are slipping and he kept me after class to tell me how personally disappointed he was in me. - Well, that sounds a little inappropriate if you ask me. His personal feelings about you have no place in the classroom, Sarah. - Well, I mean, it wasn't like that, I mean... nevermind... - What happened? - No, nothing, he just put his hand on my shoulder, but it was more like a father wou... - He touched you? - No, no, no, it wasn't like that. - How do you know? I mean, how much do you actually know about this guy, Sarah? And you're letting him determine your future? No, you determine your future. - What are you saying? - Here's what we're gonna do. Let's just... Leave an anonymous little comment about this fatherly gesture and see if anyone else has had any complaints about this guy. - I highly doubt it, everyone seems to love him. I mean, I don't... - Well, let's just leave the door open and see what happens, okay? There. Now go put something nice on. - Hey. A bit dressed up for movie night, aren't you? - Shoot, Liam, I'm sorry, I forgot I have a thing. - Let's not keep those business boys waiting. Hi, Liam. - Right. Well, I won't keep you from those business boys. - Liam, it's just a networking thing, it's not a... - Yeah, have fun. - Liam, I'm sorry, I... - Let him go. He'll come back. Trust me, they always do, but in the meantime, let's focus on finding you some more useful friends, shall we? - Okay. - Yes. - Hey... hey, Daisy. Come here. Look at this. Seven other responses from girls saying that Mr. Kent was inappropriate with them. Look. "He commented on my bra." "I caught him looking up my skirt." "He slapped my ass!" - I knew it. - I can't believe it. - Believe it, Sarah. This guy is a pervert that takes advantage of his students. Are you just gonna let that happen? Let this jerk jeopardize your future? Or are you gonna do something about it? - This is pretty bad stuff, but the internet is a breeding ground for lies. Unless we have a legal complaint filed against Professor Kent to help corroborate these online accusations, there's really nothing I can do. - It's okay, you can tell her. - Sarah, did something happen? - Professor Kent... um... assaulted me. - Assaulted you? How? - Well, I could put all the details in a police report if that would... - But I... I don't think any of us would benefit from making a big public scandal out of this. I know Sarah and I would both much rather this be handled both quietly and delicately. - Of course. I think that would be best for all parties. We are facing some budget cuts and since Professor Kent is not yet tenured, I can see to it that he's removed from all his classes, effective immediately. Would that solution work for you? - Yes, um... but I also feel that given the trauma I've endured, I should be guaranteed an A for the class. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. Dean Conway, I can't tell you how happy I am that we could find justice here today. You were amazing in there. I'm so proud of you. - I don't know, it didn't really feel too good. - Hey, you got Professor Perv kicked off campus and you helped yourself in the meantime. Psi Kaps get what Psi Kaps want. - Mom, hi. - Hey. Hi, sweetie, I... I'm sorry I'm just showing up like this. - Um, why, is everything okay? What are you doing here... - Yes, yes, everything's fine, I just barely get to talk to you and I miss you... - Mrs. Marsh, what a surprise. But I suppose that being a housewife affords you the flexibility for such unexpected visits, now doesn't it? I'm Daisy, sorority president. - Hello, Daisy. - We do love it when we have alumni visiting, but unfortunately, we do have an important brunch to be getting to. - I'm sure she can skip one brunch to spend the morning with her mother, can't she? - Well, it's actually with the women at the Domestic Violence Center, and surely you wouldn't have her disappoint a group of battered women. - Look, we'll just... - You see what... - Be out for one cup of coffee and I'll be back before the brunch. - Okay. Well, we leave at noon sharp. - Noon sharp, - I'll have her back. - Okay. Noon sharp. - I got it. - Thank you. Well, thank you for taking some time from your busy schedule to meet with me. - I'm sorry, Mom, it's just... You don't know how busy things have been. - No, I don't because you never talk to me anymore. - Well, look, you were in the sororities, you remember how it was, right? - Not like this. Yes, the girls were driven, but that Daisy? She's downright condescending. - She's helped me a lot, Mom. - Sarah? Are you scared of her? - What... what... no. No, stop. - Wait, no, honey, you can talk to me. - About what? You ruined your career before it even started so you have no idea what kind of pressure I'm under. - I'm sorry I'm such a disappointed to you, but I chose my family over my career. - Mom, what do you want from me? You told me to join this sorority so I could have a family here and I do. - Yes, but I didn't mean for you to lose your... - Well, now you're criticizing me for being too busy or something. You know, now I understand how Jill felt. You always pressuring her to be better. Well, I'm sorry, but unfortunately, I'm still just your same old screw-up kid, so... Just leave me alone. - I won't keep you from your brunch. - Hey, Whitney. - Please, don't tell Daisy. - I won't. - Thanks. I'd say I owe you one, but let's just call it even for helping with Professor Perv. - Helping how? What? - Daisy told us. How he got all grabby with you. Said that we should all go on that website and make up stories to help him get fired. The bastard deserved it. Right? Right? It's 11:58, Sarah. I was beginning to worry. - Look, Daisy, I don't really feel well. I think you'll have to go to this without me. It's funny. You don't feel warm, but maybe you should get some rest. Get that head on straight. - Yeah. Hey, Mom. Look, I'm really sorry about today, all right? I know I haven't been acting myself. But I'm gonna make a change. No more letting sorority stuff rule my life. I'll talk to you later, all right? Love you. Bye. [knock at door - Look, can I just talk to you for a second? Look, I just want us to be friends again. - Don't you have enough of those? - Jodi, I mean, like, a real friend. - I have a stand-up show tonight. Open mic at the coffee shop. You want to be friends again? Come and we'll talk after. - I'll be there. - Good. And you have to laugh. Like, even if it's not funny. Like, really loud. - Deal. Okay. God! - Going somewhere? - Yeah, Jodi has a show. - But it's TV Night. - Every night is "Something Night" around here. - Is something wrong, Sarah? You seem distant. Is it the Professor Kent situation? Because you know that we did the right... - No, we actually did the wrong thing, Daisy. I know what you did. It was all lies. - You had a problem and I helped you find the solution. That's what sisters do. - Yeah, but the man was harmless, Daisy. He actually cared about my future. - No, Sarah, I care about your future. - I'm leaving. - You know what? Maybe you're right. I'm sure that if Dean Conway discovered that your little accusation of sexual assault was all a lie, she would agree that it was the wrong thing to do. - Are you threatening me? - No. I'm simply telling you that tonight is TV Night, and "Shark Tank" starts in 15 minutes. - Damn it. - Right so when we watch, make sure you're taking notes on the entrepreneur's presentation so that afterwards we can discuss what we would have done better. - Since when do we have homework during TV Night? - Since shut up and do it. She wouldn't let me leave, Liam. It's like I'm under house arrest or something. - Last I checked, you were more than happy to ditch your friends for sorority events. - Hey, I said I was sorry about that. And, also, like, this is completely different. It's not the same. - Really? How? Why are you letting Daisy control you like this? - It's complicated, you know. - I'm so sorry, am I interrupting? I was just on my way out. - Liam... What? - Do you know what your funny friend Jodi did to us last night? - They call themselves the "Psi Kaps." Yeah, more appropriately the "psychos." - You shared our secret rituals with an outsider, breaching the Psi Kap code of conduct. Now, you're gonna have her take this video down before it does any more damage to this sorority's reputation. - Look, I'll talk to her... - Fix it, Sarah. Or I will. - Attention everyone, the library will be closing in five minutes. - Jodi, hey. - They let you out of your cage today. - Look, you need to take that video down. - The one of my performance? You mean the one that you were supposed to be there for. Yeah, hell no. I'm actually, collecting quite a following online, about 100,000 subscribers to my page. You're not the only one trying to build a career, Sarah. - Look, Jodi, I'm so sorry I missed your performance the other night, but Daisy's going off the deep end and I'm getting scared. - Well, I'm not. That uptight bitch needs to get a sense of humor. You used to have one, too, you know. - Jodi, please... - You know what, library's closing so I got to go. Sarah? Hello? - She's done, she's done, you're gonna kill her. Come on. Daisy? - Sit down, Sarah. - Um. Look, I tried to talk to Jodi about the video but she wouldn't listen to me, so... - Come on. I want to apologize. I didn't mean to snap at you earlier. It's just that you betrayed my trust and that hurts me. - I'm sorry... - Look, you know that you're special to me. I chose you to join this sorority, to be my little sister because I see something of myself in you. You're an independent thinker, you're not a sheep like the rest of these girls. You're strong. You're a leader. Tell me, have I been a good big sister? - Of course, you... - Yeah, good. Well then, I need you to do something for me. You and Maria, you're close, aren't you? Well, she just passed me in the class rankings. Sarah, I need to finish at the top of our class to be valedictorian, my future depends on it. So, what I need you to do for me is to dig up some dirt on squeaky-clean Maria. Just something that I can use to keep her in her place. I need you to find her deepest, darkest secret. - You're asking me to betray my sister? - No, Sarah, Maria is not to be trusted. I'm asking you to prove your loyalty to the only sister that truly matters. Because if you're not my sister, you're dead to me. - I took the video down, okay? So just tell your boss to stay away from me. - Did Daisy do this to you? - Just please, leave me alone. - Please, I swear I had no idea, I... I mean, I thought about just coming clean to Dean Conway, you know, telling her everything, but I saw what Daisy did to Jodi. Maria, she's on a downward spiral. - I know. She's becoming completely unhinged. It's the end of college, the end of her reign. So she's lashing out at everyone so she can stop on top until the bitter end. Thank you for telling me, Sarah, and not helping her. - Yeah, of course. I mean, she's still gonna come after you even without my help. Now I'm next on her list. We have to do something. - Okay. Okay, where does Daisy get her power? - From manipulating and controlling people? - Right. And first and foremost... her sisters. - Okay, but how are we gonna get the sisters to turn against her? - Well, they're not blind. They see that Daisy's slipping and they're tired of being pushed around. They're just too scared to do anything. All we have to do is throw the first stone. - She made me eat a cigarette as punishment. I mean, how sick is that? - Very sick. - She pops those diet pills as if we don't know and then she has the nerve to criticize me for being overweight? Wait, she's not gonna hear this, is she? She's always making us spend money on useless crap. Like, if I have to buy another Psi Kap sweatshirt... - She is so obsessed with being the best. I mean, she's a friggin' psychopath. - All righty, ladies, so I am thinking for this weekend's big Greek Week event we'll just rent out the Alabast Room. Good? Good. - Um, that's gonna be a little expensive. - Since do we count pennies? No, we're gonna do it bigger and better than Gamma Gamma. - We don't have to compete over everything. Why don't we just have it here? I think a "Heaven and Hell" party would be way more fun. - No. Why would we ever do "Heaven and Hell"? That could not be more overdone. - Yeah, you know, naughty and nice? Well, I've got a new lingerie set to try out. - What? What are you guys even talking about? - Daisy, take a chill pill. For once. - I can't believe she didn't even show up. - Cheers. To the turning of the tide. - So now Maria and I have effectively turned the whole sorority against her. - I don't know. Sounds like you stooped to her level. - Are you kidding? After what she did to Jodi? - Yeah, I know, it's just... - Look, the point is it's over, which means I now have more time for more important things. - I can get behind that. - Now go get me a drink. Hey, you look nice. - Hey, you look beautiful. - What'd you say, bro? Yeah? - My God, Liam! Liam, are you okay? Kevin, what the hell! - What the hell is wrong with you? - What? It was an accident. We were just messing around. - Liam! Are you all right? God! I tried calling you all week and they wouldn't let me in at the hospital. - My knee's shot. And I'll probably lose my track scholarship. - God, I'm so sorry. Look, I'm gonna make her pay for this, I promise. - Make who pay? - Daisy. She... Look, she's just doing this to get back at... - She wasn't even there, Sarah. - No, but Kevin's her little lap dog and he'll do anything... - Just stop. Just stop! - You don't believe me? - No. I believe you've built this girl up in your head to be some sort of monster. - She is. She's trying to destroy me. She is a monster. - Okay, say she is, I mean, if Daisy's really trying to attack me to get to you, then I'd rather just stay away. I'm sorry, Sarah. It's over. Sarah. Perfect timing. - We tried. - I want to have a little chat with you ladies. It would seem as if there has been some dissension spreading in our ranks and I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I am president of this sorority. And with that title comes a lot of responsibility. I have busted my ass and done things, some of which I am not very proud of. But I have done them all for Psi Kappa. And I have done them all for you. So if any of you ungrateful, little bitches has a problem with the way things are run around here, you can pack your bags and you can get the hell out. Or you can get in line like good little doggies and raise your damn glasses. Kay? To Psi Kappa. - Screw Psi Kappa. And you too, bitch. We all know what you did to Jodi and Liam. What are you talking about? - I'm taking you down. Well, that wasn't very lady-like. - Someone call 911! Hey, Sarah, Sarah, come on. Sarah... - Daisy. - Daisy overdosed on diet pills in what appears to be a suicide. Did anyone know she was taking these pills? - Did anything happen last night? That might have upset Daisy? - Daisy was pretty upset last night, but it was just your average sorority drama, you know? None of us... would have ever expect... - We don't have to get into this right now, okay? There'll be a investigation in the coming days. We'll be speaking to each of you individually. - Baby, did I do exactly what you wanted? - Yeah, you did good. - I can't believe you actually went through with it. I think it's kind of hot. - Well then make yourself useful. Boo. - Isn't it kind of messed up to keep that hoodie? Considering... - I kind of like it. It's like having one of those stuffed animals mounted on the wall. So we will hold our own private memorial service here after the school's. Now, remember, it is important that we maintain our composure in front of the student body. We cannot be made to look weak. Even at a time like this. Meeting adjourned. - What did you do, Maria? - What did I do, Sarah? I know what you did to Daisy. - I overheard your conversation with Kevin, I saw the hoodie, everything... - Wait, okay. So you have a hoodie, you overheard the ramblings of a dumb jock. Very impressive, Inspector. You've got nothing. - I could go straight to the police right this second and tell them everything you did. - But you won't. - And why is that? - Because we're sisters. And you would never break that bond, would you? Do you want to know how it happened? - It wasn't Daisy that beat up Jodi, was it? - It was so empowering. And she was so damn annoying. It felt so good. Now, ask Liam the best way to win a race. You hang in second place until the finish line's in sight. And then you surge ahead in the last leg. - You're sick. I was so blind. - It was easy. When you stay at the top for too long, you start getting sloppy and paranoid. Do you know how many cocktails I have had to pour for that bitch over the years? It wasn't hard to grind up a few of those mint malts and pour it into her drink to add a little extra kick. - My God, you killed her. Why? - You see... there are some people... Like Daisy, who think that power comes from ruthlessly staying at the top. But the problem with that is it makes you an easy target. I'm turning Daisy's little minion Kevin into my little minion. I am particularly... proud of that move. And I'm sorry about Liam, but maybe you shouldn't have told him what we were up to, you and I. You see, I can't have this little coup tracing back to me. That's the whole point. God, I have been so smart and so patient. I mean all those girls, they think that I am a saint. I wish that they could know that I am a... genius. But I've had to keep this to myself, no matter how much I wanted to tell anyone until now. Thank you, Sarah. I couldn't have asked for a better pawn to help make me a queen. - Why are you sharing this with me? I could go straight to the police, to Dean Conway, tell them everything, what a manipulative little bitch you are. - Because now it's your turn to be patient. All you have to do is let me graduation as valedictorian in the next few weeks, and then I will pass the torch to you. And you... will be the new queen. - And if I don't want your damn torch? - Then I will use it to burn you... to the ground. - Sarah, Are you okay? - Yeah. - Thanks for speaking with us, Sarah. As I said, I want to speak to all the Psi Kappa sisters separately. - Right, of course. - Dean Conway tells me that, um, you and Daisy were close. - Well, yeah, she was my big sister. - Any idea why she might have taken her own life? - Sarah, what is it? - Daisy didn't kill herself. - You think it was, accidental? - No, no. There's no way it was an accident. - Maria, thank you for coming. - My God... and you told all this to the police, right? - Yes, but who knows what lies Maria's been telling them, I mean... - I'm coming to get you right now. - What's going on? - We need to search your room, Sarah. - Why? There's nothing here. I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. I'm innocent! Maria did... I didn... I didn't do anything! I... I... what? No! I'm innocent! I did nothing! - Guys, I am telling you, she was obsessed with Daisy. She was always talking about how she wanted to take her down. And I'm not sure if you are aware of Sarah's psychiatric history. - You lying sack of ...! - Miss Marsh! Did you and Daisy fight the night of her death? - You bitch! You lying bitch! - You ...! She's gonna kill me! - You framed me! You framed me! - She's gonna kill me! She's gokill me! She's... - You framed me! You framed me! - Miss Marsh! - She framed me! She killed Daisy! Let me go! She killed her! She killed her! I didn't do it! I didn't do it! Let me go! - Five milligrams of alazapram, please. - Get me out of here! I don't need to be in here! Get off me! - Wait, just... - She lied! She... she lied... She didn't do this. I know my daughter. - I understand your daughter has a history of mental instability. - She had a nervous breakdown when her sister died. I wouldn't call that a history. - Look, right now the evidence against Sarah is circumstantial. The university wants to keep this quiet until there's a solid case. In the meantime, she'll be kept under hospital watch with an officer at the door. - My daughter's not a murderer. - I hope not, Mrs. Marsh. Here's my card. Please call me if you have any questions. - Okay. - Sarah, I'm so sorry that I pushed you to join that stupid sorority. It was wrong. I just... You were so distant after Jill died, and I... I felt like I was losing my other daughter too. I felt... if we had something in common maybe... - I didn't kill her, Mom. - I know, I know, I know. - There's only one person to blame and we have to take her down... but I'm gonna need your help because I have no one else. - You have me. You always have me. You just tell me what to do. - We do what Daisy was gonna do: use Maria's deepest, darkest secret against her. - How? - I'm gonna need you to sneak something for me. - I'm going to need to check the box, ma'am. - Yes, of course. They're her favorite, but I made enough for the whole staff so help yourself. Good choice. - Thank you, ma'am. - Sure. - Did you get it? - Vanilla or chocolate? What is this? - It's an app I was working on for class. It might be my best weapon against Maria. See, she was proud of her manipulation. She wishes she could have told more people so I'm gonna give her an outlet to spill her guts and fill her ego. - You're really good at this? - Let's hope. Okay. It's ready. - So what do we do now? - Well, we need to get Maria to start using the app, which means we have to make it the next big thing on campus. - Honey, I don't think the student body's gonna buy me as a trendsetter. - No, but I know someone who is. - Sarah needs your help. Wait... she needs your help to take down Psi Kappa. - Hello, dear followers, um, before I deliver the funny in today's video, I just want to tell you guys about this new app I just discovered. - What is that? - It's this new app, "Dirty Little Secret." Everyone's using it. You got to check it out. - I slept with my roommate's boyfriend. - Who's that? - No idea. Everyone's voice is masked. It's all anonymous. - It's anonymous? Okay, so, you can confess anything and there's no consequences? - Yep. - I mean, that, that's pretty sick, though. - Yeah, but so good. - You want to hear my secret? - And now a word from our sorority president and school valedictorian, Maria Ferrante. - Hi. Um, well I am excited and honored to speak with you all today. This has been a year that was tainted with a terrible tragedy. My best friend Daisy passed away so I would like us all to take a moment and just bow our heads for Daisy. You want to hear my secret? It's a good one. I killed my sister. Well, she wasn't really my sister, she was my sorority sister. It's okay though, she was a bitch. She deserved to die. What? What was that, guys? Guys, this wasn't me. Why would I do something like this? This wasn't me... that is... - Maria Ferrante, you are under arrest for the murder of Daisy Smith. - You know I wouldn't do that. You know I wouldn't do that, right? - You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you. - Come on, you know I wouldn't, you know I wouldn't... - You're entitled to an attorney, if you cannot afford one, one will be provided to you. Do you understand your rights as they've been read to you? - I'm the president of Psi Kappa, you can't do this to me, I am president! - Ha-ha. Hi. - Hey. - Wow, not bad for a guy with a busted knee. - You're late. - Professor Kent's class ran over, I'm sorry. - So Kent's class is more important than my rehab? Yeah, I guess it is. - Is that what a girlfriend's supposed to do? - No, this is. All right, I have to go, sorry. - You just got here. - I know; I have to go back to the house, you know. Fill out all these details for the event this weekend. We have a lot to do. - Copy that, Miss President. You're the boss. - No, there is no boss. Those days are over. - Come over here. - It's important that we think of this circle as a safe place where we can share all our secrets. Here, we are family. - I like your outfit. - Thanks. Here. Give me your hand. There. Now we're sisters.
