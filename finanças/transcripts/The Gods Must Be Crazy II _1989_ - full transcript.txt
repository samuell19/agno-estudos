[CHILDREN SPEAKING SAN] NARRATOR: Anyone else would die here of thirst in a few days, because in this arid desert that looks like a paradise, there is no surface water, but the slender and graceful little Bushmen of the deep Kalahari live here quite contentedly, and in complete harmony with their environment. They have lived undisturbed for 20,000 years because they are the only people in the world who know how to live without surface water. When ivory poachers in high-tech vehicles intrude into this vast thirst-land to hunt elephant, they have to drag giant reservoirs of water with them, and when the water runs low, they have to hightail it out of the Kalahari again... so the Bushmen work and play in peaceful isolation, quite unaware of the crowded and hectic world outside their domain, and even of the wars that are being fought on the very fringes of the Kalahari. Sometimes Xixo tells about the time when he went to look for the end of the Earth, and about the strange heavy people he met on his journey, but he finds it difficult to describe the beings who live outside the Kalahari, and he always ends up by saying that the heavy people are persons who seem to know some magic that can make things move, and even fly, but that they're not very bright, because they can't survive without their magic contrivances. In the mornings, they like to read the news. They can read that the hyena has a new girlfriend, that the cheetah has lost one of her babies, and the oryx is starting to migrate to the west. The older children teach the younger ones how to read all the gossip about their neighbors, the animals, because everything that happens in the Kalahari gets printed out in the sand. So it's all printed out here. This is where they started infringing on your client's patent. Give it to me there. Now, that I can present in court. Go back to frame A... and give me sales. Oh, go away, Geoffrey. Cathy, will you take this? Okay. Take him off. Now, cost per unit, and a printout on that. Mr. Geoffrey says he has to go to Hong Kong about the takeover. Okay, tell him "Have a good flight." So he won't make the ECACL conference. He can't do that to me. He said he'd like you to read the paper, says you did most of the research, so you deserve the honor. I deserve to be left alone so I can go to court on Wednesday. You'll be back before Wednesday. Oh, boy. NARRATOR: That morning, Xabe came out of the forest with the news that some of the animals had started moving towards the marula groves in the north. He ran up to his father and shouted, "The marulas are ripe. Let's go and collect some." Then Xisa and little Xiri ran up and said, "Can we come too?" Xixo said, "Let's see if you're big enough yet. If you're taller than my bow, the hyena will be afraid of you and he'll keep his distance, but if you're shorter, he'll take you," but Xiri said, "Please let me come too," and Xisa said, "I promise I'll always stay close to him." Where are they having the conference this year? In Okakarara. Where's that, Nebraska? No, Africa. Oh, boy. NARRATOR: They gathered a lot of marulas, and on the way home, they came across the spoor of a wounded elephant. Xixo said, "This elephant is very weak. It's going to die." He said to Xisa, "You and Xiri can go on home. "Tell your mother we will come when we've found the sick elephant." There was a very strange and very beautiful pattern on the ground. Xisa couldn't read it. She'd never seen anything like it in her life. There was another one, just as beautiful as the first one. She wondered how anything could make such a long, unbroken track. She followed the track and saw a very strange-looking thing. [SPEAKING SAN] She said, "You see, "this thing went round and round, "and that's how it made such a long pattern without footprints." Xiri saw a beautiful dewdrop grow, and when it dropped, another one began to grow in its place. They knew that the gods always put dewdrops on plants in the night, but here they could see a dewdrop form in broad daylight. Xisa said, "I think this thing is making the water." Xiri had never seen so much water in his life. He didn't know there was so much water in the whole world. [ENGINE STARTS] They found the elephant, and they saw the tiny wound that had made it die. The tracks told Xixo the heavy people had been there, and he wondered why they had taken the useless tusks and had left all the valuable meat to rot. He said, "The heavy people do strange things." Bo said, "I'll call Xabo's family to help us eat the meat. If I run all day and all night, I can find them by tomorrow," and Xixo said, "We'll go and call our family." [♪♪♪] There were many tusks. It takes the gods more than a man's lifetime to make a full-grown elephant, and it horrified them to see that so many had died. [SPEAKING SAN] Xixo and Xabe found the place where Xisa and Xiri's tracks suddenly stopped. Xixo said, "Look, Xisa climbed onto the thing, and then Xiri went up too, and it took them away." He said, "Tell our family "they must go to the dead elephant "and start eating it. I'll fetch Xisa and Xiri." I'm sorry you had to come on such short notice, but we're very honored to have you. I would've liked going on the safari tour, but I have to prepare my presentation. You're sure you'll be all right here? I'll be fine, thank you. Good, I'll leave you to it. You know where Stephen's working? Yeah, I think I've got a rough idea. Well, you may have to search around for him a bit. Right. And Jack? Yeah? Tell Stephen we'll send the rest out to him later. Right. What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? Oh, boy. You don't buy it. Uh-uh. Okay, I'll try again. Hi. How would you like to come fly with me? I have to work this. That's why I turned down the safari trip. Trip's three hours. I'll show you lots of Africa in a half an hour. What do you say? I have to present this at 3:30, you know. Oops. Only half an hour? Yes, Doctor. So, what are you, a doctor of medicine? No, corporate law. What a tiny plane. We have a smaller one, but we can't find it. Can it fly? In you go. What are those? Buffalo. Look, no hands. Flies by itself. Safest plane in the world. Coffee. Morning, boss. You only done 80 miles. Yeah, I slept a little bit. You stopped. I was bushed, so I pulled up and... You slept more than four hours. I was real pooped. I told you we're running late. I was really pooped, boss. Move over. It's okay, boss, I'm fresh now. Get. Jeez, boss. Lazy bastard. Get back to sleep. I'm wide awake now. Sleep. Yes, boss. I'll be right back. Mm-hmm. Hi, Stephen. Hi, thanks. You're cutting it fine, you know. There's a hell of a cumulus building up. One of those thermals grabs hold of you, it's going to whip you right over the escarpment. You'll be 20, 30,000 feet. See you later. RADIO: Stephen, is Geoff there yet? Over. Hi, Bob. Yes, he's here. Over. Can you fly back in with him? We found a baby giraffe that looks very sick. We need your advice. Over. Okay. Out. You know you're not supposed to cart your floozies around in that. No, she's not a floozy. Hi. Morning. Do you do some kind of work around here? [ENGINE ROARS] Hello, Stephen. Come in. Over. Stephen, are you there? Over. Hello, Stephen. Come in. Over. Hi, Bob, this is Jack. Over. Jack, don't take off yet. There's a freak storm moving in very fast across the escarpment. Over. Uh, Bob, they've just taken off. Over. They? Is there someone else with him? Over. Yes. Over. Who? Over. Uh, there was this young lady. Over. Was she with you? Over. Uh, sort of. Over. Boy, you're in trouble. Over. Over. Xixo's old friend Waka was standing there, looking at the tracks the heavy people had made. Xixo greeted him, and told him that his children were in the thing that had made the tracks. Waka greeted him back, and said, "I'll come with you to find your children," but Xixo said, "There's a dead elephant back there. "Go there with your family, so that they can help my family eat it." [BEEPING] [MOTOR SPUTTERING] They stopped. I think there's some whiskey under your seat. No thanks, I'm okay. Give it to me. You're going to start drinking? Give me. Can this thing fly on Scotch? George. Boss? Take over. NARRATOR: Xisa said, "When this thing gets tired, it will stop to rest, then we can follow the tracks back home." [ENGINE SPUTTERING] Running out of Scotch. This any good? Uh-uh. We're flying backwards. [♪♪♪] I have to read my paper at 3:30. How do I get back? We have to find a road so I can hitch a ride. So which way to the nearest road? This is baobab country. Oh, it can speak. We're at least 300 miles from base. Oh, boy. Maybe more. I'm sorry. Any time. I have to get to a telephone. I don't even know what country we're in. That was one hell of a storm. Hey! Great. Great. They're not scared of me. So? They don't know about people. We're in the deep Kalahari. Will they find us here? Eventually. Well, how long is eventually? Maybe a day, maybe a week. A week? I have to be back in New York on Wednesday. You're from New York? You mean I have to survive here for a week? Anyone who can survive in New York can survive here. We'll starve to death. There's enough food around here. Our problem will be water. All we have is that six-pack up there. NARRATOR: They were getting quite thirsty, but they knew where there was plenty of water. [SPEAKING SAN] She said, "No, I'm too heavy for you to pull me up. "You come down here so you can push me up. Then I can pull you up." Xiri had never been in water, but he soon got used to the idea, and quite enjoyed it. Is that water? Petrol. Gas. So? If I can get this thing down, we can fly out. Today? I have to take it apart, bring it down, assemble it again. Eventually. Maybe by tomorrow, the next day. [ROARING] Was that a lion? Yeah, I can hear them. Let down the rope. I want to get up. They won't bother us. You're okay, they're bothering the hell out of me down here. Will you let down that rope? They're not coming this way. What about eventually? If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. And if they're hungry? They're far from here. It's swarming with wild animals down here. If don't bother them, they won't bother you. I'm not bothering them. [HYENA LAUGHING] This one is drooling at me. It's a hyena. They're always drooling. So? Ignore him. Don't smile at him. Why not? He might think you're threatening him. Let me get up there. [ROARING] You're enjoying this. Yeah. Why don't you relax and enjoy it too? What's to enjoy? Wild animals all over the place, no food, no water. No room service. Yeah, no plumbing. What I need is plumbing, now. Go behind that thicket. Alone? I mean, the lions are that way. They're very far. If you don't bother them... They won't bother me. I know, I know. How do I get down? How'd you get up there? The lion was roaring. Wasn't a lion. It was a hyena sounding off. Right. Now, just a minute. Turn your back. Pull me up. I can't. Friction. Then let me down. What do you want me to do? Don't look at me. What do you want me to do? Let me down, let me down. [HYENA LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] What's so funny? Okay, I won't bother you, see? So don't you bother me. Watch it! Go away! Run, run, run, run, run, run. Get up a tree! You okay? You said if I didn't bother them... I see there's a baby rhino back there. Maybe the mother thought you were molesting it. I only talked to it. I didn't even smile at it. They're going. They're going away now. I'm not coming down before you can fly me out of here. There's no plumbing up there. You thirsty? Yes. All right, you can have half a beer. Great. Don't open it yet. Sorry. Oh, my goodness. Um... Sorry. What did I do wrong? Well, it's warm. Drink it now. [LAUGHING] Right. It's getting late. We have to find food before it gets dark. I saw an ostrich nest. Do they bite? No, they kick, but they aren't very bright. If you lie down flat, he can't see you. That's the male. He has to guard the eggs, but if you can distract him... How do I distract a male ostrich? [SPEAKING SAN] Lie down flat! [OSTRICH SCREECHES] For a moment, Xixo thought he saw his children's footprints, but it was only a baboon that had walked past. [SPEAKING SAN] [GUNSHOT] So, what went wrong? Nothing. We got the egg. You mean that was standard procedure? Got a match? The thing came back. I'm sorry. You got a match? I've got a lighter. Big Ben calling Ramjee. Big Ben calling Ramjee. Do you read me? Ramjee, come in. Big Ben calling. Come in, Ramjee. Still out of range. Maybe they're not there yet. He said he'll meet us on the ninth. That's yesterday. Sorry, boss. [TUNING RADIO] it is expected that 10,000 people will attend the opening. Although nine helicopters and four spotter planes are taking part in the search, no sign of Dr. Marshall and Dr. Taylor has been found. Was that us? I suppose so. Doctor of what? Zoology. You? Law. [SINGING] We have to watch that guy. The hyena? He's a hell of a coward. As long as you're taller than him, he'll keep his distance, but if you lie down, he'll take a chunk out of your face and your leg. You can take the first watch. Call me when the moon gets to there, and I'll take it to there, and then you can take it to first light. Coming down. I'm ready. For what? You only jumped 25 centimeters. What happened to standard procedure? Maybe next time. Where are we going to take off from? There's a salt pan about three miles from here. How many blocks? Keep the sun over your right shoulder. Stay clear of low branches. What? It's that damn rhino. It's a male. It's harmless. What are you always climbing up trees for? I'm not a doctor of zoology. How am I supposed to know about males and females? Damn near wrecked the nose wheel. Give me slack. You only jumped 124 centimeters. These things are dangerous. It's very small. But when it grabs hold of you, it never lets go. Kind of cute. [TIRE HISSING] Hey. No! Now we've got a flat. What do I do with this? Why don't you throw it away? It'll just come right back. Can you change the tire? Can you undo my boot? It's the one that stepped on him. So? If I give it to him, he can have his revenge. There. [♪♪♪] Is there enough gas to take us all the way back? If we get it off the ground. No, it won't work. Can't you fix it? No pump. You want to be the wheel. You're crazy. You see that stick? When I shout, "Now," you bring it over this way. But I can't fly a plane. It'll lift your side of the wing, then you center up. Push out again, you pull it back. You see? Bring it over, center up, pull it back. Then what? Then I'll take over. But I can't even drive a manual. Do you want to kill us both? You're nuts. I can't fly a plane, you hear me? I can't fly a plane! Throttles. Shiny ones, push them forward. Here we go! Come on. Stick it back. Center up. I told you I can't fly. Pull back. Not way back. Pull it, pull it, pull it. Will you make up your mind? Bring her down. What? We go that way. You said you were going to take over. You should have gone that way. Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Ask a woman to do anything, and she buggers it up. So she buggered it up. [AIRPLANE OVERHEAD] [ENIGINE DIES] Just look down and read. It says "On. Off." Switch it off, then you can glide. Ha ha! Whoa! I told you I can't fly. It says, "Ballistic parachute," clearly and distinctly. Read it, press the button, and you'll be okay. I told you I can't even drive a manual. "Oh, it's easy." "Bring it over, center it up, pull it back, and get it right, woman." I showed you so nicely. I said, "Bring it over." Not "Bring it over!" You'll break your silly neck. You don't explain properly. I could have broken my neck. How the hell am I going to find you with only one boot? Better find my boot. Shoo. Go away. [ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINE STOPS] [GROWLING] Oh, shit. [SINGING] Wait! Hi. Do you want to sell me your bike? Look, I'll give you money. I give you money, you give me the bike. [SPEAKING SAN] No, I have to go that way. There's a man there. I'll pay you, you take me that way. [SPEAKING SAN] Here. Please, I insist. [SPEAKING SAN] Okay, I'll pay you when we get there. There? [SINGING AND HONKING] Well, why don't we try something else? Oh, yeah, sure. Oh, all right. Good thinking. Are you going to hang in there forever? There. Lunch. Go on, try it. Okay, try that. [SINGING] [SHRIEK] [WHEEZING] Look, I'm really sorry. Please take this. [SPEAKING SAN] No, come on. Bye. [SINGING] Well, thanks. Bye. Got to find somebody. You said you were tired. [COUNTING] Hey, go home. Go back to your family. Go on, get. Get. Shoo. Go. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [JEEP APPROACHING] [THUMP] [SHRIEK] [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] [SPEAKING SAN] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SAN] [SPEAKING SPANISH] English? Okay. Get up. Move. Which way? To my jeep. Stop. Where are you going? Where is your jeep? We go to your jeep. Stop. March. Which way? You know why a compass has a mirror on back? Why? So you can see who's lost. Okay, we go northwest. That way. March. How far did you fly, for Pete's sake? How the hell am I going to find you? Damn! Hey! Hey, you, get away! Leave it alone. Get out of here. Give me back my can. Scumbag. You mugger. Thank you. You keep away. Stay there. See these? If you dare... Don't even think about it. You'll be sorry. Go away. Okay, you can have this one, and no more. Leave the can. Do you hear me? Leave my can alone and go away. No, don't bring a friend. I'm not going to water you, and your friends, and your relatives, and I'm not... Aah! Excerpts from the Geneva Convention. Forget it. It says here about how a prisoner of war ought to be treated. "No prisoner of war "shall be subjected to inhumane treatment. No outrage shall be committed." Okay, stop. You can rest for three minutes. What's your bloody hurry? None of your business. Three minutes. I'm pooped, man. Hey! Don't do that! Come back. I'm going to report you to the Geneva Convention. Come back. You're my prisoner. Come back. Come out of there and be my prisoner! You mustn't do that! March. So if you're so smart, how come you don't even know what country you're in? So which way did they go? I'll just have to wait till they come back. [RADIO PLAYING] Xixo saw a heavy person dressed in funny clothes sitting next to the track, talking to herself. She looked like a woman, but she had a man's voice. [SPEAKING SAN] Hey. Oh, it's your way of greeting. We do it this way. Sorry. Okay. I'll do it your way. Hello. I'm very glad to meet you. He said, "Where is your family?" He looked at her tracks, and said, "You are alone. "How did you get here? He said, "I have to find my children. "There are two heavy people playing some kind of game. "They went that way, now I hear them coming. Perhaps they'll let you play with them." You want me to go with you? Uh-huh. He showed her the tracks where he met the two heavy men. He said, "This is where they turned back. "See how angry this one was, "because the tired one grabbed the stick from him, "and then he had to run. It was very funny." But, of course, she couldn't understand. She was also quite illiterate. She couldn't read the signs and tracks at all. We're waiting for a bus? Well, what do you know? Go away. Bugger off. I don't want to see you. Stop! Who are you? Xixo couldn't understand what these crazy people were playing at. This thing penetrates. You wouldn't shoot a lady. He said, "I have to go and find my children." He remembered the men had bad manners, so he didn't say goodbye to them. I don't want to be involved in your wars. I'm American. Okay. Hey, you can't leave me here. You want me to die? Get away from me. Get away! Try again, huh? It's not fair. You can't both use me. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Okay, drop it. Drop it. Yes, drop it. Drop it, drop it, drop it! [SPEAKING SPANISH] Can't we negotiate? I want to go home. If I don't get back to Biera by tomorrow night, I'm going to miss my plane back to Cuba, then I'll spend another six months in this goddamn Africa. And I've got to take you to my base, now. Well, I have to be in New York on Wednesday. Sit down, and stay clear of the goddamn Cuban. I'll stay clear of goddamn both of you. I resent being used as a hostage object. Got to be in New York on Wednesday. You should have stayed there. I didn't ask you to come out here. I have to walk my ass off to find you. Well, good. [HYENAS LAUGHING] What's so funny? Switch it on. Big Ben calling Ramjee. Big Ben calling Ramjee. What are you doing? What am I doing? Look at the sun. You're going the wrong way. Boss, I'm driving on the compass. This thing is made of steel. You left it there. Look at the needle. You buggered the compass, you stupid bastard. Jeez, boss, I wasn't thinking. Stop the bloody truck. So when did you put it there? Well, I drank some coffee just at sunrise, boss. Five hours. 40 degrees off. Stupid bastard. Big Ben calling Ramjee. Big Ben calling Ramjee. Do you read me, for chrissakes? Ramjee, come in. Big Ben, where the hell are you? Look, I'm sorry. This idiot I've got here bugged the compass. I've been waiting three bloody days. Where the bloody hell are you? We're way off course. Now we have to backtrack for at least five hours to find our bearings. We're going back in our tracks now, so we'll be out of range again. I'll contact you when we come back into range. Little Xiri saw hyena tracks. The spoor was very fresh, so he knew the hyena must be close, and it was downwind, so it was sure to smell him. He remembered his father had said, "If you're taller than the hyena, it'll keep its distance." It couldn't understand how this small creature had grown tall so suddenly. Perhaps the hyena hoped that Xiri would get small again, so it followed him... at a respectful distance. Well, we got blown here in a kind of a plane, and then I kind of lost Dr. Marshall. Get in the jeep. Move. Wait there. Okay, but leave your bag. Why? You swat people. No, I won't, I promise. Look, I'll take out the rocks. You got rocks in there? You drive. In there. Start her up. That way. Xixo saw another track made by a heavy person, and the footprints told of a man who was in a bad way. He spoke to the track. He said, "I can see you need help, but I must find my children." Turn right. Stop. Hey, that's my jeep. I know, I knew it. Go siphon. Gas? But my tank was almost empty. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Oh, boy. [SPEAKING SAN] Hi. Xixo said, "I don't know what to do. "You need someone to find water for you, "but I'm worried about my children. "I've been running for two days and a night, "and I haven't found them. I think they're very far." What have you got? About two liters. 14, 15 kilometers. How much have you got? About 20 kilometers. How far is your base? 60, 65. Oh, my God. My base is 20 kilometers. Shut up. Get up. Watch it! Stop it! I said, stop it! Stop it right now! [GUNSHOT] Lady, be careful with that. Give it to me. I'm the good guy here. He's a bloody Cuban. Give it to me. Jeez, lady. Yes, make my day. Okay, señorita. My base is only 20 kilometers away. There's going to be a plane to Cuba tomorrow. Give me the gun. I'll take you there. This guy doesn't know where he is. You couldn't even find your own jeep. How are you going to find your base? You find it. You're so smart. We're going to my base. Who says? I says! Stop it! You, get behind the wheel. No. No, get back. You've got to stay together. Um... take his hand. I said hold hands. Okay, get in. You go around that way. Okay. Now, can either of you fly a plane? Yeah, I can. Good. Drive back to where we started. Watch it, boss! [HORN BLARING] Jeez, boss, we killed a little kid. Sit down. We've got to get out of here. But, boss, it was a little kid. He's okay. He's okay. [SPEAKING SAN] Jeez, boss, there's another one. Xiri! Xiri! Xiri! Xiri! Now Xisa didn't know which way to go. What if her little brother had been left back there? [CRYING] Stop here. This is where the Bushman found me. That means the plane must be... [SPEAKING SAN] That guy's only bad news. Follow him. We're low on gas. Follow him. We're low on gas. Follow him. [CRYING] Hi. Hold hands. Get out that side. Go that way. Stop. Goodbye. Thank you. What happened? It's nothing, just kind of dehydrated. Does "W" stand for water? I don't have to tell you. Okay, open your mouth. Who's the little guy who gave me that stuff? I don't know. He just keeps on appearing and disappearing. Who are they? They're soldiers. They look very affectionate. No. Are they your prisoners? Kind of. She hijacked my jeep and she kidnapped us. You did it to me first. Both of them. He did it, then he did it. She hit me first. You hit him? Yeah. She hit me too. Damn near killed me. You hit them? Took them prisoner with a gun? Yeah. No, we're still backtracking. Keep going. Yes, boss. We nearly knocked over another crazy Bushman. You're still in Bushmen country? Oh, it beats me where they come from. You said nobody would see you. Bushmen don't count. Oh, my God. Ben, what happened? Bloody Bushman was crawling all over. What do you mean, "crawling all over"? What are you doing? Hey, you okay? What are you doing? What are you doing? What were you doing up there? Did he see the ivory? I don't know. He must have. Then you can't let him go. That's right. You a game warden? Get him in here. You come with us, you get in there. Here. Boss? Make him get in. You come with us, you get in there. You get in there. Hey, you mustn't do that. Get in there. Can't you do anything right? Jeez, boss. Get me a tie-down. What are you going to do, boss? They did it to me, and he wants to go that way, he wants to go that way. The one who's got the gun gets to say where we go, and I've got the gun, and I say we go to the plane. Okay. In the jeep. When we get to the plane, you can have your jeep back. And my gun. We'll see about that. What the hell do you think you're doing? It's his, boss. Stop. Here are those tracks again. Okay, the plane must be that way. How are we going to take off? I'm not going to be the wheel again. Now we can fix it. I don't see a pump. Don't! You've got to watch them. [TRUCK APPROACHING] Yours? No. Game rangers. What do we do, boss? He's got a gun. Don't let him see the ivory. Maybe they've got a pump. Could you lend us a pump? What? Could we borrow a pump with a... Oh, no! What have you done to him? Drop that! Throw it away! George... Get the gun. What do we do now, boss? Tie them up. Boss? Give me that. Get the tie-downs. Jeez, boss. What's this about? I don't like game rangers. I'm not a game ranger. Me too. This is all I've got, boss. Tie them two by two. [HOWLING] What are we going to do now, boss? I've got to talk to Ramjee. Big Ben calling Ramjee. Do you read me? Ramjee, do you read me? Out of range again. George, you see that dome? I'm going to go up there to get range. Got to talk to Ramjee about this. I'm leaving you in charge. You watch these people. Okay, now, you people. You behave, nobody gets hurt. Oh, my God. [GUNSHOT] Get the gun. Hey, you mustn't do that. My boss will kill you. Got it. Okay, let's go. Get in. What do you mean, "Get in"? Move it, man. Mister, come with us. I'm coming too. He's going to kill me. You, give me first gear. Hurry! [ENGINE SPUTTERING] I knew it. I knew it. I told you we're low on gas. Let's get out of here. Move your ass, man. What a day. Game rangers, two soldiers, and a woman. What did you do with them? I tied them up. What the hell? George! Yes, boss? [GUNFIRE] Your turn. Your turn! No, it's not! It is, it is! No, it's not! It is! No, it's not! Okay, dammit. I'll get the bastard. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] No, get up. Untie me. Come on. [ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING] [SPEAKING SAN] Hey! [SPEAKS SPANISH] Oh, no, man. He's not so crazy. He knows what he's doing. He's making a firebreak. Clever little bugger. It'll burn out now. That's it. [SPEAKING SAN] They're your kids? Yes, we passed them back there. There's a tiny one and then the other one. Yeah, that way. Yeah. Why are you crying? He lost his kids. I told him where to find them. So you have to disappear again.

He can't hit a moving target. No! When I say, "Go," you run around like crazy, all right? Go! Stand still, you bastards. [GUNFIRE] [CLICK] Throw it away. Okay, okay, okay. I'm your goddamn prisoner. I don't want you. You're a, you're a... you're a shitty prisoner. Xiri! [ECHOING] [SPEAKING SAN] [LAUGHING] Okay, thank you. Okay, goodbye. Bugger off to Cuba and don't get lost.
