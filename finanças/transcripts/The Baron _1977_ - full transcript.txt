And that's it. - 40 thousand dollars is little money? - We don't need it all at once. 10 or 12 now-- - If 40 thousand dollars is little money, 12 thousand must be tiny, tiny money. Who paid my 300 thousand dollars? - Cokeman, I am serious. - I'm glad you are because I want to ask you a very serious question. What if I wanted my money back tonight? What would you do? - [Jason] I haven't thought about it. - Come on, pretend like it's in your movies, and I want my money back tomorrow. - Well, we could try and sell what we got already. There's a guy on the coast I know who makes deals with the studio. Maybe we can get a negative pickup here. - Magic words. Negative pickup.

I'm listening, man. - Well can't you stop that thing? - Oh come now, Jay. I'm getting him for his show. We can still talk, can't we? (man chuckling) - Show the film to anybody yet? - Everybody who had to see it has seen it. - Well, come on, man, what happened? - They loved it. It's a great story, it's really strong. And Von Trip, he's like, like a modern day Superman. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa now. - [Jason] What kind of deal will I get? (man chuckling) - Now how would I know? I haven't worked it out yet. But what I'm saying, Jay, is if you want a deal, you got it. - Fantastic. How soon can we start shooting? - Well, Jay, I had a thought. You know Bob Redford could really play this part. I mean, there's no reason this story couldn't be about a white guy. I mean, don't misunderstand me, bro. You did an absolutely marvelous job. But why limit ourselves? - What do you mean? - Well the big guy, he wants to, well, he wants to start all over again as a white movie. And, Jay, let me tell you, it's a much bigger ballgame that way, really. - I see. - Well, what do you think? - Well, as a would-be-star, (Jason chuckling) I'm not pleased. But then again, as a producer, well, why not? And after all, it is your money. - Oh, Jay, they would like to put on another producer. - But you know I can handle it. - Oh, come on, Jay, it's your first film and it takes time. Now don't be unfriendly. Don't be unfriendly. They just wanna have somebody with a little more experience. - And what do they have in mind for me? - Why, you're gonna work with the guy that takes over. Whoa. It's your baby, right? - Right. - And don't you worry about a thing, Jay. You've got a job, I'll see to that. Now what do you think? You didn't know I could ride, did you? Look at him.

I don't wanna spoil the party. I'm not in a very festive mood tonight, Cokeman. - What's the matter, baby? - I just received a distressing piece of news. As a matter of fact, if it's not an imposition, I prefer to go downtown. Maybe you could cheer me up. - No imposition, Joey. Let's go, baby. Now, listen, keep the party going, order anything you want, have a good time. I'm just gonna take a little ride downtown. Look at that! (Joey humming tune) (Joey speaking foreign language) - Don't be shy with me, Cokeman. You're my guest, order anything you want. - I've already eaten, Joey. (Joey chuckling) - You make people look at this table, I don't like that. - What do you mean? - Your silly outfit. You see, people here aren't used to seeing people who look like you. They're looking at this table, it makes me nervous. - I'm sorry, Joey. I lied to you, man. I never set up any situation in Albany. I bullshitted you, my friend. - I think it's effeminate to dress up the way you do. You're all dolled up like a woman. - I put the money you gave me into a movie. (Joey laughing) (Cokeman laughing) A movie, Joey. (Cokeman and Joey laughing) - I don't go to movies. There's too much violence. - I'll make it up to you, Joey. I have a partner on the coast who's negotiating a deal right now. - Oh, a deal, huh? - I got somebody on this, Joey. And I'll have the money for you. - Those people are still looking at me. They're wondering who this classy looking guy is with that gaudy black fag. - I'm not bullshitting you this time, Joey. I'm playing it straight. And I'll pay you back every cent. - You black joke. You make people look at me like I'm some sort of jerkoff. That's what happens when I'm with you. People look at me and I get upset. - Yeah, I was a fool to pull a number like that on you, Joey. I'll pay you back every cent, I swear to God. (Joey laughing) - You probably feel like peeing in your pants right now, don't you? That can't happen at the table now, can it? (ominous music) (Joey laughing) You know, I always wondered what you looked like under all those fancy clothes. And you know what? You're just a chubby little black man. (guys laughing) (ominous piano music) (traffic whooshing) You scared of heights? I'm scared of heights. What's that called? Oh, acrophobia, that's it. Why don't you climb over the side? I can't do that but I bet you can. - Come on, Joey, be serious. - [Joey] Get out there, I want you to do it. - I can't do that. - I want you to climb out there, fashion play. Or maybe you need some help. (ominous piano music) (traffic whooshing) Woo-wee. Well you certainly are a brave man, Cokeman. Mmm-hmmm. I couldn't do that. Point to where you live, Cokeman.

I can finish it anywhere. - So you're gonna leave the nigger holding the bag. And what about your old lady? No telling what they'll do to her. - I'll be back before there's any trouble. Month or two, maybe even less. I am Baron Wolfgang von Trips. Racing car driver and hero to millions. - This is a rented car, Jason, remember? The real Von Trips died trying to win a race. Is that what you're into? (Jason mimicking race car) - Vroom! Vroom, vroom, vroom. Vroom. (Jason humming race car engine) All my life I've been selling hustles, June. I've been a wind bag. Showboat.

You're going because I've got things to do that I don't want you to see. - [Caroline] No! - [Jason] You're going because I balled a fancy white lady just to see if I had the jazz to do it. - You're lying. It's Cokeman. Cokeman's making you do this! - Forget about Cokeman! It's me! Can't you understand I wanna be rich more than I wanna be your husband?

Is that how you make your living? Driving tourists through the park? (Jason laughing) - He's just as adorable as adorable as you said he was. Oh, come on, I know how to cheer you up. Here. Why don't you teach me your fancy game and take my money? - Oh, now that sounds like a fun idea. Yes, let's do that, darling. - Yes, darling, let's do that! (Jason snapping) - I already have an opponent. - Well, why don't we have switch? All three of us can play. - Oh, Prince, I couldn't possibly. I'm just a novice at this thing, you know. - Well, all right, then the two of you play. I'll referee. - Thank you. Lovely. - Get me a chair, please. - All right. What color do you want?

Well, I told you I'd get you laid. Well let's see the lady. Let's see the hoe. - Will you come outside for a minute, baby, please? - [Joey] And I hope she's clean. I don't want my man to get a dose. - I've got my partner working on it and you're gonna have the rest of your money in a month. - She's not bad for a moulinyan, huh? Go on, take her in the bedroom and do her. - They ain't gonna hurt me, babe? - Everything's gonna be fine, baby, just be cool. - Baby, please, don't let them hurt me! - Just trust me. - [Woman] Baby!

But never before on dry land. - I'll give you my marker for this. Let's go home. - Oh come on, let's have fun. Look, I'm just a lucky flash in the pan. Don't let me rattle you. - You don't rattle me.

Take the money, man. - [Joey] No, no, no, no. - [Cokeman] Come on, Joey. - Uh-uh, no. I don't take any money from anyone who crawls in red pajamas. That's bad taste. (heartbeat thumping) You know, you got no class at all. (Cokeman whimpering) (Cokeman gasping) (heartbeat thumping) (audience applauding) - This has been a divine evening. But really, darling, we must stop. I mean, after all, he has won 20 thousand dollars or our money. - Okay, cab driver. Double or nothing. (Cokeman gasping) (heartbeat thumping) - Help me. (Cokeman gasping) - What do you know? A dope dealer with a heart condition. (thug laughing) (Cokeman gasping) (heartbeat thumping) (Cokeman gagging) (Jason laughing) - [Jason] Woo. - Here's my marker. - Hmmm? - Uh-uh. (Jason chuckling) - Mmmm. Didn't see that. - You're gonna burst out of all your clothes, Jason. - I gotta keep my strength up. I'm back in business and I've got a very heavy day. - [Mama] I thought you were through with the film business. - That's what my partner thinks too. But what goes around comes around. And it's all coming my way, Mama. - Careful of the car, hotdog. You pay for the scratches. (Jason laughing) - I'll try to see you tonight, sweetheart. I'll try. (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (foreboding music) - I sure hope you got my money. Because your friend didn't have enough. He said you could make up the difference, huh? Well, you got my money? - Like I told you, some of it. (Joey chuckling) - You won 40 thousand dollars playing black gay-man? - Backgammon I'll teach it to you sometime. (Joey chuckling) - Well, Mr. Movie Star Stud, you just saved your life showing good faith. You are a pretty one, aren't you. You must be a prize stud, huh, movies star? - Look, I made a deal with Cokeman. I need more time. (Joey chuckling) - Ah, you're so impractical, movie star. You know, you pretty people got no head for the nitty gritty, you know? - Look, let's go see Cokeman right this fucking minute, huh? - I don't go to funeral parlors to talk business. - What're you saying? Huh? What happened? (Joey chuckling) - Well. Well, you see, he was so upset with you, he started to bleed. It's nice country out here, lots of fresh air. Look, I didn't kill the fat, black fool, you did. You did, movie star. Oh, you're a pretty little killer, aren't you? You play games I never heard, you go to movie premieres and you kill your business partners by choking them with bullshit. - Get your fucking hand off me! (Joey laughing) (Jason groaning) - You're a fine stud. And you've already shown good faith. I know you're going to perform for your fat rich lady friend and I know she's gonna give you some money for it. Because that's the only way you're gonna stay alive. (door thudding) - Over here, hotdog. Did you make your deal? Oh well, what difference? We'll go downtown and do some shopping and I'll get you a pretty shirt or something. That'll cheer you up. When things go bad, I always go shopping. It's like taking a cold shower. (Jason chuckling) - Mama Lou, I need 300 thousand dollars or I'm a dead man. - Is it that bad, hotdog? - It's that bad. - That's a lot of money. What do I get out of it? (Jason chuckling) (Jason laughing) - You get me. (Jason snapping) (Mama giggling) - I'll buy that. (Jason laughing) (people chattering) - Goombah, como va. - Sit down, paisan. - I got it. - Please, my friend. Let's talk business later. Go on, eat, help yourself. - Oh, I've eaten. - Now don't be rude and insult my friendship. I said eat, movie star. - I thought we were gonna meet in some (Jason chuckling) parking lot or trailer out in Brooklyn. - You go to the movies too much. - Well, this is a bit out in the open, isn't it? - We're friends, we're partners. We don't have to hide like a couple of scumbags. (Jason laughing) You've shown good faith bringing me all this money in two days. Brought all, that's the best faith I've ever seen. - Well, I wanted to get this over with as fast as possible. - Eat the zucchini, Mr. Black Gay-man. - It's good. - The whole kit and caboodle in just two days. You're fantastic. You know what? I'm asking you, my black friend, know what? - No. - There's some business associates of mine might think that a nigger, excuse me, black man, who coughs up that amount of money in just two days is a pussy. Pigeon and a pussy. But not me, no, I know you're a movie star and you can do the impossible. 300 thousand dollars in two days. How'd you do it? - I took a loan. (Joey laughing) - What do you have, notches on it? - It's all there. Nice, crisp 50s. - You really are a sharp-looking dude. Isn't dude the word you guys use? - I gotta go now. - You mean you're gonna walk out of here owing me 300 thousand dollars like I'm some kind of asshole? - What're you talking about? - A man's died. A dealer who was worth money to us. Of course, interest on the loan has occurred alarmingly and there are traveling expenses, they mount up. And it's an estimate, mind you. But the amount of your obligation has escalated to another 300 thousand. (Joey sighing) We're gonna love each other like brothers. You're gonna teach me your games and your jive and all your fancy black tricks. You've shown such good faith, I wanna work with you. In fact, Mr. Polish, Mr. Sharp Guy, Mr. Hung Black Gay-man Movie Star, I'm gonna be your personal manager. Black films are very interesting, something I'd like to get into, there's lots of action. - Hey. - Hey, what? - What am I doing here? I spent my whole life trying to be fantastic and here I sit, talking to a piece of shit like you. - Are you nuts? - Shit. - You still owe me 40 thousand dollars. (Jason chuckling) - I'm gonna kill you myself. - Since you've shown such good faith, I'll take a deposit. Huh? - I'm gonna blow your brains out. (Jason chuckling) - Goodbye. And good luck. Hands on the table. Well, I guess you've gone about as far as you can go, huh? - Get this fork out of my neck. - How are you going to explain this to your family of greaseballs, huh? (Jason chuckling) Will you answer me that, little man? (Joey gagging) (intense music) (heartbeat thumping) See ya later. (thudding) (phone ringing) - Hello, Jason! - We're already here, bright boy. We know you don't give a damn about your friends up here. But she told us there is somebody you care about. Your pretty little wife. We want you, we want the money and if we don't get it, bye, bye birdie. (upbeat bongo music) - [Boys] Wow! Wow! - [Boy] Who are you, mister? Who are you, mister? Who are you, mister? Who are you, mister? (melancholy music) (door pounding) (metal cranking) (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (exciting beat music) (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (explosions rumbling) (police sirens alarming) - [Radio] Calling car 24. - This is car 24, the ambulance just got here. They're both dead. Truck driver's okay, a little shook up though. - [Jason] Okay, it's time to go to work. (birds chirping) (lights hissing) - [Man] 96, take six. (clapper clicking) - [Jason] Action! - Hey, baby, what's happening? - Fantastic! (people cheering) (upbeat music) - Hey! Ole, ole! Hey! (exciting music) (music distorting) (pleasant music) (exciting beat music) (exciting beat music)
