2306, please. Hello, honey. How you doing? Good. What did he say? Uh-huh. Is he still there? How long ago did he leave? Uh-huh. Yeah, well I'm stopping here, then I got a little meeting, and then I'll, I would if I could. As soon as I can. Yeah, let me get off and I, yeah, let me get off and I promise you it'll be okay. A bunch of bullshit. Waste a good man's time. Hi, could I speak to Dr. lowenstein, please? It's rather important. Could you get him for me? Bunch of bullshit trying to make a living oh these deadbeat leads. I swear to god, shel, I'm on a sit today... Hello, Mrs. swoboda, this is Dave moss. Yeah, we spoke yesterday. Now, on the rio rancho estates, we've had a situation just come up. The president of our company is in town just one day, and he has certain parcels... = doctor. Well, could you get, what do you mean? He's not there? I have to speak to him. Yes, it is fairly urgent. Mr. levene. No, I can't be reached. I'll get back to him. He has certain parcels, certain choice parcels which he's given me a hold on for the next 48 hours. Now, what would be the best time to get you and your husband together? Say, tonight, at 10, or tomorrow at eight? Okay. Okay, what would be the best time to do that? Look, you sent in the, no, no, listen to me now. I've got 48 hours to make you a lot of money. Well, when will he be home? Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes. They don't give you the leads, they don't give you the support, they don't give you dick. Yeah. Then they're yanking us in on some sales conference. When's the last time anyone made a dime on it learned a goddamn thing? All it does is some jerk shoots his mouth off. I swear to god, shel, I got half a mind to go across the street. I got half a mind to go with you, if they'd take me. Well, you never know. Talking to Jerry graff last week. I gotta call these deadbeats back. Baby, I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads, and you're killing my ass on the street. I'm sorry you aren't happy here. Yes, well that's very cute, but you're running this office like a bunch of bullshit. You're on an override. You make money, we make money. I'd like you to make more money. Then give me a better lead and don't go waste my time. A sales conference? The strategy comes from downtown. Oh, the strategy? The strategy? Well, I think I'll pass. I wouldn't. Why is that? When you come, then you'll see. Shelley. John. Are you ready to do or die tonight? Oh yeah, always ready, John. Always ready, John. Now one thing. We were talking about the leads, and I understand we've got some new ones. Yeah, that's what we're gonna talk about at the meeting. We are? Because I'm running into a bit of a snag. Yes, I've seen your sales figures. That's the leads, John, you give me a better lead... That's what we're gonna be talking about tonight. Personal bind, you understand? Personal problems, I could use a leg up. After the meeting. I hear the new glengarry leads... After the meeting, shel. Hey there, Ricky. - Hello, John. Wet out there tonight. = huh? Wet out there tonight. Uh-huh. - Maybe it'll break the heat. - Yeah. Al, give me a quick j&b, huh? Double. Cutty, al. They say... = huh? They say it was so hot downtown this afternoon, grown men on the street corner were going up to cops begging the cops to shoot them. They say you should not drink alcohol when it's so hot. Who says that? Something I read. For they say it dehydrates you. They say you should drink water, but I subscribe to the law of contrary public opinion. If everyone thinks one thing, then I say bet the other way. Added to which, you know they're wrong. Well, that's what I'm saying. Slow tonight. Oh, yeah. Well, I guess everybody's staying home. If my daughter calls, anybody calls, I'm over at the office. Thanks. I had a woman in white plains on the hook. Five units, mountain view, what happens? She has to check with her lawyer. You let her check with her lawyer? What could I do? = t dunno. Shelley. =- huh? Who's the guy? Couldn't tell you. I don't like the whole thing, you know, "cause all I need is a lead. They won't give out... - Uh-huh. The rich get richer, that's the law of the land. Who belongs to the bm? = it is 7:30. So who is that? And where is Mr. roma? Well, I'm not a leash, so I don't know, do I? Let me have your attention for a moment. 'Cause you're talking about what? You're talking about... Bitching about that sale you shot, some son of a bitch don't want to buy land, somebody don't want what you're selling, some broad you're trying to screw, so forth. Let's talk about something important. Are they all here? = all but one. I'm going anyway. Let's talk about something important. Put that coffee down. Coffee's for closers only. You think I'm fucking with you? I am not fucking with you. I'm here from downtown. I'm here from Mitch and Murray. And I'm here on a mission of mercy. Your name's levene? Yeah. You call yourself a salesman, you son of a bitch? I don't got to listen to this shit. You certainly don't, pal, 'cause the good news is you're fired. The bad news is you've got, all of you've got, just one week to regain your jobs, starting with tonight. Starting with tonight's sit. Oh, have I got your attention now? Good. 'Cause we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest. As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac El dorado. Anybody want to see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired. Do you get the picture? Are you laughing now? You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them. You can't close the leads you're given, you can't close shit, you are shit! Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it, 'cause you are going out! = the leads are weak. The leads are weak? The fuckin' leads are weak? You're weak. I've been in this business 15 years. - What's your name? - Fuck you, that's my name! You know why, mister? Because you drove a hyundai to get here tonight, I drove an $80,000 BMW. That's my name. And your name is you're wanting. You can't play in the man's game? You can't close them? Then go home and tell your wife your troubles. Because only one thing counts in this life, get them to sign on the line which is dotted! You hear me, you fucking faggots? A-b-c. A, always, b, be, c, closing. Always be closing. A=I-d-a. Attention, interest, decision, action. Attention. Do I have your attention? Interest. Are you interested? I know you are, because it's fuck or walk. You close or you hit the bricks. Decision. Have you made your decision for Christ? And action. A=I-d-a. Get out there, you got the prospects coming in. You think they came in to get out of the rain? A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy. They're sitting out there waiting to give you their money. Are you gonna take it? Are you man enough to take it? Crap. What's the problem, pal? You, moss. You're such a hero, you're so rich. How come you're here, waste your time with such a bunch of bums? = you see this watch? You see this watch? Yeah. That watch costs more than your car. I made $970,000 last year. How much you make? You see, pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing. Nice guy? I don't give a shit. Good father? Fuck you, go home and play with your kids. You want to work here, close! You think this is abuse? You think this is abuse, you cocksucker? You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you get on a sit? You don't like it, leave. I can go out there tonight, the materials you got, make myself $15,000. Tonight, in two hours! Can you? Can you? Go and do likewise. A=I-d-a. Get mad, you son of a bitches. Get mad! You know what it takes to sell real estate? It takes brass balls to sell real estate. Go and do likewise, gents. The money's out there, you pick it up, it's yours, you don't, I got no sympathy for you. You want to go out on those sits tonight and close, close, it's yours. Not, you're gonna be shining my shoes. And you know what you'll be saying. Bunch of losers sitting around in a bar, "oh yeah, I used to be a salesman. "It's a tough racket.‚Äù These are the new leads. These are the glengarry leads. And to you, they're gold. And you don't get them. Why? Because to give them to you is just throwing them away. They're for closers. I'd wish you good luck, but you wouldn't know what to do with it if you got it. And to answer your question, pal, "why am I here?" I came here because Mitch and Murray asked me to. They asked me for a favor. I said, "the real favor, follow my advice "and fire your fucking ass, because a loser is a loser." Bunch of fucking nonsense. Treat people like that. The fuck is he gonna get ff? Mickey mouse sales conference. He didn't mean it. I'm sure he didn't mean it about trimming down the sales quota. Where is roma? Where the hell is Mr. Ricky roma? All the while we got to sit here, eat this nonsense? Hello? Mr. levene, how's she doing? Uh-huh, yeah, is she awake? Oh, the doctor came by. What did he say? Uh-huh. Okay, well look, I can't come in tonight. I think, yes, I know she is. Ti know that she is. I've gotta go out. Will you please tell her when she wakes? I've got to go out. And tell her I'll call her from the road. Thank you. Gentlemen, you heard the man. - What is this in aid of? - As of tonight... What is this? Excuse me. - Excuse me. What it's in aid of is that Mitch and Murray... Fuck Mitch and Murray! Fuck 'em, I'm doing my job, I got to put up with this childishness? =-t don't make the rules. I'm paid to run the office. You don't like the rules, Dave? There's the door! Two lead cards for tonight, two lead cards for tomorrow. As you heard, end of the month, top salesman on the board gets the El dorado. - Next man down the... - What about the good leads? The leads I've given you. = but these leads are shit. They're old, I've seen that name 100 times. The leads are assigned randomly. What about the new leads, huh? The new leads. The glengarry leads. I've got them. I'm gonna hang onto them. And they'll be assigned to closers, based on the sales volume, first to roma. - Where is roma? - Don't worry about roma. He'll get his leads, you've got yours. He's top name on the board, so he don't have to be here for this shit? = that's correct! And as the hour is waning, I suggest you, those of you who are interested in a continuing job with this organization, get to work. That's garbage. Bullshit. Thank you for your attention. = bullshit! How am I supposed to close these? Look at this. I've had this guy before. I've been to his house twice. Ti can't... T can't close this stuff. Shelley, how am I supposed to... They're gonna bounce me out of a job. Hello, Mr. palermo? I'm sorry. Mr. speice? Mr. Robert speice? Yeah, this is George aaronow. I'm with rio. I spoke with your wife earlier. Yeah, I'm the vice president of rio rancho properties in furman, Arizona. Yes. I'm calling from the airport, and consulting my map, I see that you and your wife live near the airport. I have some rather unusual, rather good information on the property... Hello? Hello, this is Sheldon levene. Please listen closely, I only have a moment or so. I can speak only to a Mrs. nyborg. Oh, this is Mrs. nyborg. Please listen closely, Mrs. nyborg. I'm calling from consolidated properties of Arizona. Our computer has chosen you from all of the many thousands who write in requesting information on our properties. Now by federal law, as you probably know, the prize must be awarded to you even if you are not engaged in our land development plan. The only stipulation, of course, is that you and your husband must sign at the same time for the receipt of your prize. Now, I will be in the area tonight, possibly tomorrow. What do you think might be a convenient time to meet with both you and your husband? Of course I'll hold. Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh? Ti can't close them. Nobody can close 'em. They're old. They're ancient, a bunch of fucking nonsense. Get some jerk to come in here. Sometimes I think, I wonder if I belong in this business. Send a guy out there, no support, no confidence. Then I say, "nobody can close 'em." Then I look at roma. Roma, fuck roma. Had a freak little run of luck. The leads are garbage. Then I say, "why give him the good leads? "He doesn't need 'em." You going out? Yeah. I have to go out. I can't make a sit. Have you tried? Yeah. Something's wrong with me. What is it? I can't push through. Get your coat on. You're coming out with me. - Something in me. - Forget it. - Itry, I try. - I said forget it, come on. = t can't close 'em. Life. I swear to god, you work all your life... Forget it, George. - Fellas. - Roma, so on, so gifted. Gifted, my ass! The guy gets a string of luck. No, no, no. The thing of it is, money's tight. When times are tight, it don't do no good to throw this fart around, just go out and sell. Threaten a man all you want, you can't whip a dead horse. Nope. All this garbage, "sell 10,000, you win a Cadillac, "you lose, we're gonna fire your ass?" It's medieval. Yes, it's wrong. Yes, yes it is, and you know who's responsible? Who? You know who it is. It's Mitch and Murray, 'cause it don't have to be this way. = no. Look at Jerry graff. He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got that list, with the nurses? You see? That's thinking. Why take a 10% sales commission? Why are we giving the rest away? What are we giving 90% for? For nothing. For some jerk in the office, tell us, "get out there and close, go win a Cadillac.‚Äù Graff, he goes out there and buys. He pays top dollar for it, you see? Yes, for the leads, that's thinking. Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself. That's what? That's thinking. Who? Who's got a steady job, a regular job, a couple of bucks nobody's touched? = nurses. Graff goes and buys a fucking list of nurses. One grand. He paid two, I'll eat my hat. 4000 or 5000 nurses, he's going wild. He is? Yeah, he's doing very well. I heard they were running cold. - The nurses? - Yeah. You hear a lot of things. No, he's doing very well. = with river oaks? River oaks, brook farms, all that shit. Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing, himself? 14, 15 grand a week. = himself? That's what I'm saying. Why? He's got the leads. He's got the good leads. What are we? We're sitting in the shit here. Why? Because we got to go to them to get them. 90% of our sales we're paying to the office for the leads. Well, there's our leads, there's overhead, there's phones, there's a lot of stuff. What do you need? A telephone? Some broad to say, "good morning?" Nothing. It's the leads. The whole thing is the leads, you understand me? You can't sell to a void, you got to get a goddamn person. You get a lead, you get a person. I'll go in there and sell 'em. Otherwise, what do they want from my life? Hello, Danny? Dan, it's shel levene. Yeah, we spoke, last may, I called you. I was in town from my estate in rio rancho, and, Arizona. I wish we could have gotten together at that time. Danny, that piece of property I had for you has increased in value. Grace, grace, what was that figure? $76,000. Oh, Danny, I wish you could have been in on it with me. Look, I'm here overnight, I have to go home tomorrow, and I thought, after the interest you showed on the last trip, that, hold it, grace. Danny, I know that you're serious, and because of that, I am going to shove my appointments around and make sure. Oh, well gee, I wish that... All right, Danny. Yeah, all right. Going out tonight, shelley? What is this bullshit with the sales promotion? = it isn't bullshit. It's the way it is. You're gonna fire the bottom men on the list? That's the way it is and I don't make the rules. The rules come from downtown. I got a problem here, John. I'm closing up the office. Yeah, well come across the street, have a drink with me. I've got to get home. Hey, do me the courtesy, huh, five minutes? Just five minutes. I am trying to get home for two hours. I got to go home, grab one hour with my kids, come back here, see if any of you closed a contract, take the contract... How about one minute? What is it? = t can't close these leads. = then move on. Don't jump! Hey, don't jump out of your manager bag a second. It's just two guys talking, am I right? We're just talking. You got the new leads. If you would give me, now just hold on. The glengarry leads Mitch and Murray told me are to be assigned only to closers. Yeah, hold on a second. If you give me the good leads... Shelley, you blew the last good one I gave you. No, no, hold on a minute, will you please? T did not blow 'em. One kicked out. One, I closed. = you didn't close it. Would you listen to me? Please, I closed that cocksucker. His ex. John, his ex, I didn't even know he was married. The judge invalidated it. Shelley. What was that job, huh? Bad luck. That's all it was. I pray you never find it, it runs in streaks. Oh boy, that's what it's doing, that's all it does, streaks. I pray that it misses you and that's all I have to say. Shit, I've got to eat. Williamson. Look at the sheets. 1987, '88, '89, six months in '89, who's on top? Roma. = under him?? Moss. Oh, bullshit, John! April to September it's me, it's no fucking moss. Due respect, he's an order-taker. Talk, talks a good game, but look on the board, it's me. Not lately it isn't. Not late, well, lately, kiss my ass lately. Look, you call Murray and you call Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who do you think bought the new car, huh? Call Mitch. The Seville? Oh, he came in here, "you bought that for me, fella." And out of what? Hey, look at me! Out of what? Nothing! Cold calling. You want to talk about a sale? You are really beginning to burn my ass, kid. I can't get a lead, you, it was skill, John. It could be working for you, you want to throw it away. = it isn't me. Oh, it's not you, gee, I wonder who it is. Who the fuck am I talking to? Now look, I need the leads to sell. After the contest. After the 30th. Bullshit, "after the contest!‚Äù If I'm not on that board by the 30th, they're gonna can my ass. I need those leads and 1 need 'em now or I'm out. You're going to miss me. I swear to you, you will miss me. Let me tell you something, shelley. I do what I'm hired to do, you might do the same. Jesus. = now wait a second. I'm hired to watch the leads, to marshal my sales force. I'm given a policy. My job is to do that, what I'm told. = now wait a second. Anybody falls below a certain Mark, I'm directed. I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads. How do they rise above that Mark? With dreck? With this toilet paper that you're giving me? You give me one premium lead. Do you know what the premium leads cost? Do I know what the premium leads cost? Yeah, I know what they cost. I generated the sufficient dollar revenue to buy them. But I cannot sell shit! Jesus, and I've seen these before, you know. Christ, I saw these back, homestead, 1985, we pitched these cocksuckers baywater. They couldn't buy it. They couldn't buy a fuckin' toaster. They're broke, they're deadbeats. Hey, look, just give me some leads that don't come out of a phone book, huh? You give me something hotter than that and I can close it. It's just a streak, I'm gonna turn it around. Hey, I need your help. I can't do it, shelley. = John. Give you 10%. = of what? My end. What I close. You give me the premium leads, you're in for 10% of what I close. And what if you don't close? = t will close. Yeah, what if you don't close? = t will close. What if you don't, you understand? Then I'm fucked. You think you're the only guy with a family? You see what I'm saying to you? = John. I step out and you don't close, then it's my job. Then I'm fucked. = t will close! Now, 10% John, I can get hot, you know that. Not lately you can't. = that's defeatist. Fuck it! Go with me. Get on my side and let's do something. You want to run this office? You heard what the man said, "attack." Let's do something. Huh? = 2090. All right. = and 50 bucks a lead. No? = oh! Oh. Oh, shit. Listen. I gotta talk to you. Permit me to do this a second. I'm older than you. A man acquires a reputation on the street. What he does when he's up, what he does at other times... I said, "10," you said, "no." You said, "20," I said, "fine." Now you want to throw this 50-buck thing in. John, a good deal, a deal, has got to be one where both parties, okay, okay, okay, fine. 20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done. Let's go out. We make some money. I got bills to pay, huh? I want two sits tonight and I want the good leads, the glengarry leads, two. Two, John, because I am gonna close 'em both. It's a long road with no turning, pally. Huh? Okay, now let's go. I've got to go back to the office to get 'em. Go on, let's go, huh? You see, this is what I was saying, John. All you need, a little boost, you turn a streak around. Am I right? Good, huh? Huh, good? What? What? Two leads, 100 bucks. = now? Now, yes. When? Shit, John. = t wish I could. You fucking asshole. T don't have it. Ti don't. I'll bring it in the office in the morning. I'll be coming with the sales. Nope. Can't fucking believe this. All right, here's... 20, 30, and... Oh come on, Jesus, here's the 30 and I'll bring the rest in tomorrow. Now we gotta do this, huh, pal? For Christ's sake! = no. My daughter. I can't do it, shelley. I gotta tell you something. It wasn't so long ago, I'd pick up the phone and call I Murray, I got your job, you know? Hey Murray, the kid is burning my ass. Shelley, he's gone. You are gone before I'm back from lunch. Bought him a trip to Bermuda once. - I've gotta go. - All right, hey. Give me... I'll take two more of the old leads. I gave you two today. Oh, Christ, one is a bust-out, John, and the other ain't home! Shelley. I promise you, I've been on the phone, I know. No more leads today, two per day. You've got yours. All right. All right? = sure. We will do that other thing. I guess I left my wallet in my room. = deadbeats. Deadbeats, all of 'em. My mistake. I shouldn't have took the leads in the first place. You had to. =- yeah? Why? - To get on the... To get on the board, yeah. How am I gonna get on the board trying to sell a doctor? Two regular, two chocolate donuts. Give me the same thing to go. And I'll tell you what else, don't ever try to sell an Indian. I will never try to sell an Indian. Get these names come up, you ever get 'em, patel? You ever get 'em? Well, I think I had one once. You had one, you'd know it, patel. They keep coming up. Ti don't know. They like to talk to salesmen, something, they're lonely. I don't know, they like to feel superior, never bought a fuckin' thing. Ti don't know. Come down the line. Doctors, lawyers, Indians, times are tight. It's tight. Pressure's just too great. Man can't work, all of 'em. You go in the door, I gotta close this fucker or I don't eat lunch, or I don't win a Cadillac. We work too hard, George. Remember when we were selling Glen Ross farms? Didn't we sell a bunch of that? Yeah, they came in... They fucked it up. - They did. - They killed the goose. And now... We're stuck with this... Stuck with this fucking shit. = this shit. It's too... = it is. You get a bad month, all of... Run us. They put you on this board. Some contest board. It's not right. It's not right to the customers. I know, it's, hey. What did I learn as a kid on western? Don't sell a guy one car. You sell him five cars over 15 years. That's right. You're goddamn right, it's right. Guys come in, oh, the blah, blah, blah. Ti know what I'll do. I'll go out and Rob everybody blind and go to Argentina, 'cause nobody ever thought of this before. So they kill the goose, and the fuckin' man's worked all his life, he's gotta... That's right. = cower in his boots... Boots, yes. For some fuckin' sell 10,000, win the steak knives. What do you do? What can you do? What can you do if you don't have the leads? If you do not have the goddamn leads! Mr. spannel? Sheldon levene, I was speaking to your wife earlier? = come in. - Cats and dogs, huh? - Yeah. Oh, cats and dogs. Oh, I see you're interested in fishing. Yeah. I've fished myself, many years. Muskee, Wisconsin. Ooh, a beauty. Where's the missus? - Out at the pta. - Ah. What was this in reference? I spoke to your wife earlier on the phone. I called, I'm in town with rio rancho. Yes, yes, I'm sorry. She said you had some sort of award? Yes, I was speaking to the people in my sales organization, my representatives in this area, and Mr. spannel, your name is Larry. You mind if I call you Larry? All right, Larry. We had a consultant, and he made me an offer. He offered me $230,000 to promote a sales plan, you see. A plan to present our investment opportunities in rio rancho to the public. Well, I said, "hell, let me save you the 230 "and pass the savings along to the investor.‚Äù My people immediately said, "whoa, how do you do that? "How can you present investment opportunities "without television, without magazine ads?" I said, "you take something this good, you go to a man "has invested in the past, you go to him direct "and offer the money to him, rebate. "And don't give it to this expert.‚Äù So you're here to sell me some land? No, I wouldn't try to sell you that. I leave that to the salesmen, you know? And people who want to own land. I think something has to be fed, watered and painted, but don't invest in it, and that motto has stood me in good stead. Mister... Just call me shelley. I have never been afraid of familiarity. I'm walking out the door, I've got to pick up my wife at the... Let's take my car, huh? We'll pick her up together. Spoke to the little woman on the phone, can't wait to meet her. No, we're going over to our relatives'. Oh, she didn't say anything about that. I'm sure she forgot. I'm on a plane to Florida. Well, I'm sorry if we put you out. No, you didn't put me out. I'm just trying to think, Larry. You know, that's the only parcel that I've got. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go back to the computer, I'm gonna pull another one, and we're gonna speak to your relatives, too. No, no, no. C'mon, you're a busy man, Larry, and so am I. My god, I'm in the act of giving a gift away. Look, I don't want to buy land, ti don't want to invest in land. I have nothing. She took the call without my knowledge. I have no business that I wish to transact. Okay, I don't want to tell you how to handle your wife. My wife filled in a form, and we have been plagued for the last year by... That's the situation that I'm trying to alleviate, Larry. No, no. Do you understand? Thank you, no. Roma, man, he don't care. He don't care. He's sitting on top of the world. He's got the good leads, the good prospects. Sales, sales. = sales contests. That's what I'm saying. Times turn hard, they bounce you out of this job. If they bounce you with no confidence... That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying to you. You know, if they get you on a bad beat, they get you on, and you gotta go out there, get a new job. With no... = with no confidence. Yes, I'll tell you what the hard part is, it's to stop thinking like a goddamn slave. You say the Nazis in Europe, you know, "if they came in my door," you know, well bullshit, the time is now. What do you do now? Some guy pissing in your face. Cocksucker, wants to break your rice bowl. Mitch and Murray, fuck you. What I say, fuck you! Sitting on the good leads. George, we're men here. Yes, and I'll tell you. I'll tell you what the hard part is. What? Starting up. Standing up. Breaking free of this bullshit, this enslavement to some guy, 'cause he's got the upper hand. Listen to me, George. Now Jerry graff went into business for himself. He said, "I'm going on my own." And he was free, you understand me? I'll tell you. I'll tell you what somebody should do. What? Somebody should stand up and strike back. Somebody should do something to them. What? Something to pay 'em back. Someone should hurt them, Mitch and Murray. Somebody should hurt them? Yeah. How? Someone should do something to hurt them where they live. What? = someone should Rob the office. That's what I'm saying. See, if we were that kind of guy to hold up the joint and trash it, it looks like robbery, we take the fuckin' leads out of the files and we go to Jerry graff, and we take the fuckin' glengarry leads! Huh? Yeah, Mr. nyborg? Ah, Mr. nyborg, Sheldon levene. I was speaking to your wife earlier. That's right. I'd like to speak to you about your prize, awarding you your prize. We're coming to the end of our fiscal year, I'd really like to get it off the books before, ves, the prize for consolidated properties. Yes, the information you requested on rio rancho. Now, I'm in town only for a couple of, well, let me see, I suppose I could swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh. Well when do you think it might be more convenient? As I said, I could swing by tonight. Well, of course, yes, you speak to your wife. Grace, I'm gonna need a first-class seat, passport, 10,000 in cash, put that with the negotiable papers, if you would. And put me on the telex hookup with, yes? Well, when do you think Mrs. nyborg might be back? All train compartments smell vaguely of shit. It gets so you don't mind it. That's the worst thing that I can confess. You know how long it took me to get there? A long time. When you die, you're gonna regret the things you don't do. You think you're queer? I'm gonna tell you something. We're all queer. You think you're a thief? So what? You get befuddled by a middle-class morality? Get shut of it. Shut it out. You cheat on your wife, you did it. Live with it. You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality? Maybe. And then what? If you think there is, go ahead, be that thing. Bad people go to hell? Ti don't think so. You think that, act that way. A hell exists on earth? Yes. Ti won't live in it. That's me. Did you ever take a dump, made you feel like you slept for 12 hours? = did I? Yes, = t don't know. Or a piss? Great meals fade in reflection. Everything else gains. Do you know why? 'Cause it's only food. This shit we put in us, keeps us going, it's only food. The great fucks you may have had, what do you remember about 'em? What do I remember? Yeah. Ti don't know. For me, I'm saying what it is, it's probably not the orgasm. Some broad's forearm on your neck, something her eyes did. There was this sound she made. Or it's me in the, I'm telling you, I'm in bed the next day, she brought me cafe au lait, gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete. Eh? What I'm saying, what is our life? Our life is looking forward or it's looking back. That's it. That's our life. And what is it we're so afraid of? Loss. What else? The bank closes, we get sick, my wife died on a plane? The stock market collapsed? What of these things happen? None of them. We worry anyway. Why? What could we get for them? For 'em? = for the leads. What could we get for the leads? Ti don't know. 10 bucks a throw, 15 maybe. Ti don't know. For the leads, you're saying? Yeah. How many leads do we have? The glengarry? The premium leads? I've gotta think they've got 500, say 500 leads. You're saying a fella could take those leads and sell them to graff? The leads to graff, yes. I was saying, yeah, a guy could take, like anything else, it seems to me, that is negotiable, a guy could sell 'em. How do you know he'd buy 'em? = because I worked for him. You didn't talk to him? = no. What do you mean? Did I talk to him about this? Yeah. Are you just talking about this, or are we just talking about it? Yeah, we're just speaking about it. Speaking about it as an idea? Yes. We're not actually talking about it. No. Talking about it as a robbery. As a robbery? = well. Hey. So all this, you didn't actually call graff? You didn't talk to him? Not actually, no. You didn't? No, not actually. - Did you? - What did I say? What did you say? I said, "not actually.‚Äù Fuck you care, George? We're just talking. We are? Yes, because it's a crime. Robbery. That's right. It is a crime. It's also very safe. You're actually talking about this. That's right. You're gonna steal the leads. Have I said that? Are you? Did I say that? Did you talk to graff? What did I say? What'd he say? What did he say? He'd buy 'em. You're gonna steal, you're gonna steal the glengarry leads and sell them to graff? Yes, what's he gonna pay? He figures there's 500 leads, let's say 10 bucks apiece, that's $2500 each. Each? Each? That's right, George. No, you and me. Yeah. That's exactly what I'm saying. $2500 apiece, you and me, for one night's work, and a job with graff, working the premium leads. A job with graff? - Is that what I said? - He'd give me a job? He could take you on. Hello? I was dialing the direct line to my daughter's room. Sheldon levene. Yes, she's in, well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep. But where's the duty nurse? They canceled her? Well, let me talk, who am I speaking to? I'll have the money there tomorrow. It's a big decision, George. Times a guy's gotta make one. It's a big decision and it's a big reward. $2500 and a job, it's a big reward for one night's work. Yes. You know, sometimes a guy... Sometimes, a man if he wants a reward. That's absolutely right. He'll do one thing, one thing on one night. That's absolutely right. The thing is that it's gotta be tonight. - What? - What, what? The leads ain't gonna leave? They bring those leads up, they wave under your nose, tomorrow they're taking 'em downtown, parcel 'em out, a guy wants those leads, he's gonna have to go get 'em tonight. Tonight is the thing. Talk about a chance. It's when a chance presents itself. So you're saying you gotta go in there tonight. You. I'm sorry? You. Me? You have to go in. You have to get the leads. T do? It's not something for nothing, George. I took you in on this. You have to go. It's your thing. I've made a deal with graff. I can't go in. You know, I've spoken out on this too much. I got a big mouth. "The fuckin' leads," et cetera, "the fuckin' tight-ass company," blah, blah. They'll know when you go to graff. What will they know? That I stole the leads? Ti didn't steal the leads. I'm gonna go to the movies. Then I'm gonna have a late drink or two at the como inn with a friend. Dave. = yes? You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads? Yes. = no. Oh, yes, George. What does that mean? = listen to this. T have an alibi. I'm going to the como inn. Why? The place gets robbed, they're gonna come looking for me. Why? Because I probably did it. Now let me ask you this, are you gonna turn me in? What if you don't get caught? They come to you, are you gonna turn me in? Why would they come to me? They're gonna come to everybody. Why would I do it? You wouldn't, George. That's why I'm talking to you now. They come to you, are you gonna turn me in? = no. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. = uh-huh. George, when they come to me, if I have to go in there, and if I get caught, they come to me. - You don't have to go in. - I have to go in, see? That's something I have to do. Why? Why? Are you gonna give me $7500? 757? I thought we were splitting five grand. I lied, all right? Your end "s 25, my end" s my own concern. Now, stick with me here, George. They come to me, I'm caught, they're gonna ask me who were accomplices. Me. - Absolutely. - That's ridiculous. Well, to the law, you're an accessory before the fact. = t didn't ask to be. Well, it's tough luck, George, because you are. Why, because you just told me about it? That's right. Why are you doing this to me, Dave? Why are you talking this way to me? T don't understand. Why are you doing this at all? None of your fucking business, pal. Just in or out? You tell me. You're out, you take the consequences. - I do? - That's right. - And why is that? - Because you listened. Well, when will Mrs. nyborg be back? You know, I hate to keep calling you this late, Bruce, but I feel a responsibility, I must say. When you have... You know, they say, "you don't buy it, you rent it." = huh? The thing. You really... What do you keep? I mean, you don't keep anything, really. = no. Security. Things. You know? Mm-hmm. It's just, you try to stave off insecurity. You can't do it. = no. No, that's what I'm telling you. Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real estate, what are they? An opportunity. To what? To make money? Perhaps. To lose money? Perhaps. To indulge and to learn about ourselves? Perhaps. So fucking what? What is it? They're an opportunity. That's all they are. They're an event. A guy comes to you, you make a call. You send ina card, I have these properties I would like for you to see. What does this mean? What do you want it to mean? You see what I'm saying? Things happen to you. Glad I met you. I'm glad I met you, James. I want to show you something. It may mean something to you, it may not, I don't know. I don't know anymore. What is that? Florida. Glengarry highlands. Florida. Bullshit. And maybe that's true. And that's what I said. But look at this. What is this? Listen to what I'm gonna tell you now. What happened? You, where do you work? I work, yes, I work here. What is it? What happened? A robbery. = Williamson. Williamson, did they get the contracts? All right, tell me. Now, tell me.

Okay, now, talk to me. I'm still trying to sort it out. So far... - Talk to me. Talk to me. They got some of the contracts? Lingk. James lingk, which I closed last night. You closed it last night? = yes. I filed it, it went down. = you filed it? James lingk? - Yes. = it was sent downtown? Yes, all right? I filed it last night. It went to the bank. It went downtown, all right? = you filed it? Then I'm over the fuckin' top, you owe me a Cadillac. I don't think... I don't want to hear any fuckin' shit and I don't give a shit. Lingk puts me over the top. You filed it, it went downtown, now you owe me the car. The robbery makes difficult... Fuck you, you owe me the car! See, 'cause this is how we keep score, bubby. You told me, "close thus, and so you get the car." I got it. Would you excuse us, please? = you hear what I said? Do you hear what I said? Hey, pal! Your excuses are your own! Recontact James lingk.

When criminals come and they take, they steal the phones? They stole the leads, they stole the phones, they stole, oh, Christ. What am I going to do this month? Shit. You think they're gonna catch, where you going? = down the street. Where you going? To the, what do you fuckin' care? Aren't you going out today? With what, John? With what? Well, answer me. They stole the glengarry leads. They stole rio rancho. I have stuff from last year's file. Oh, oh, oh. Your nostalgia file. Oh, great. That's great, 'cause you know, I don't have to...

See, the thing of it is, were the leads insured? You think? What? Were the leads insured? I don't know, George, why? 'Cause if they weren't, I know Mitch and Murray... - What? - They'll be upset. That's right. You're right. He said we're all gonna have to talk to the guy. - To... - The cop. Great, we have to talk to the cop. Another waste of time. A waste of time‚Äù? Why? Why? 'Cause they're not gonna find the guy. The cops? Yes, the cops. No. The cops aren't gonna find the guy? Nope. Why do you think so? Why? Because they're stupid. Where were you last night?

Easiest thing to remember. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Patel? Ravidam patel? How am I gonna make a living on these deadbeats? Where'd you get this from, a morgue? - Look, I'm... - Come on, what's the point? What's the fuckin' point? In any case, I gotta argue with you, I gotta knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls to sell your dirt to deadbeats, money in the mattress. I come back, you can't even keep the contracts safe. I gotta go out, fuck this shit. I'm gonna go out and re-close last week's stuff. No, no, no, the word from Murray is leave them alone. He needs a new sig, he'll go out himself. Murray's gonna go out? Yeah, he'll be President of the company, just come in from out of town, all right? Okay, okay, okay. Give me this shit. I'm giving you three leads. Three? No, I count two. = there's three leads there. Patel? Fuck you. Fuckin' Shiva handed this guy a million dollars, told him, "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.

Anybody's going out, I could use some coffee. You do get the opportunity. Fuck is that supposed to mean? You do get the opportunities. You get 'em as I get 'em, as everybody gets 'em. I don't care they stole the contracts? Now I got 'em in the kitchen, I'm eating their crumb cake. What does that mean? It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month. None of my business, you want to push me to answer you. So you haven't got a contract to get stolen and so forth. You got a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that? Shut the fuck up. Ricky, you got a mean streak in you, and what the fuck are you babbling about? You bring that shit up on my volume? If you were on a bad one and I brought it up to you, you'd harbor it. You'd harbor it a long, long while, and you'd be right. Who said "fuck 'the machine?" = fuck "the machine"? Fuck "the machine?" Fuck "the machine!" What is this, courtesy class? You're fucked, Rick. Are you fucking nuts? You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place. - Wait a minute, Dave. - Shut up! Okay. You want to decide who should be dealt with how, is that it? I come into the office today, I get humiliated by some jag-off cop. I get accused of, I get shit thrown in my face by you, you genuine shit, because you're top name on the board? Is that what I did, Dave, I humiliated you? Oh my god, I'm sorry. Sitting on top of the world. Sitting on top of the world, everything's fuckin' peach fuzz. I don't get a moment to spare for some bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately? Fuck you! Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth. You make a close, this whole place stinks with your farts for a week, how much you just ingested. Oh, what a big man you are! Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum, I'll show you how to chew it. Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile. How fucked-up you are! Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm? And what are you? What are you, Ricky, huh, bishop sheen?

You were saying? = huh? = come on. Come on, you got 'em in the kitchen, you're in your shirtsleeves, you got the stats spread out, you can smell it. Come on, snap out of it. You're eating her crumb cake. Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake. How was it? = from the store. = fuck her. Bruce, harriett, what we have to admit to ourselves that we see that opportunity and take it, and that's it. Now, we just sit there, I got my pen out. "Always be closing.‚Äù God, that's what I've been saying, the old ways. Convert that motherfucker, sell him, make him sign the check. They got their money in government bonds, I said, to myself, "fuck it, let's go all the way, "the whole route." I take it and plat it out, eight units, 82 grand, and I say to them, "this is now. "This is that thing that you have been dreaming of. "You are gonna find the suitcase on the train. "The man walks in the room, that bag is filled with money. "Harriett, this is it, and Bruce, "I don't want to fuck around with you. "No, I don't. "I don't want to pussyfoot around, huh? "You think you gotta look back on this thing? "I do, too. "Now, I'm here to do good for you and me, the both of us. "What is the point of some interim position? "The only arrangement I will accept is full investment. "And I mean it, that's it, all eight units, period.‚Äù Now I got the pen in my hand, Rick, hey. I turned that contract around, that's eight units, 82 grand, and I said, "now, I want you to sign.‚Äù Ti sat there five minutes. Then I sat 22 minutes by that kitchen clock on the wall. Ricky, not a word, not a motion. And what am I thinking? Is my arm getting tired? No, I did it. Just like the old days, like I used to, like I was taught. T did it. Like you taught me. Hey, nobody ever, well, if I did, I'm glad. No, what I did, I locked on 'em. I locked all on them, nothing on me, on them. And oh god, I am holding my last thought, now is the time. They signed. It was great. It was so fucking great. It was like they wilted all at once. Mm-hmm. No gesture, nothing, just together. Honest to god, they both imperceptibly slumped. And then he reached and he took the pen and he signed, passed it to her, and she signed. It was so fucking solemn. I let it sit, and then I nodded. I said, "harriett, Bruce," then I pointed into the living room to the sideboard. I didn't know there was a fuckin' sideboard in there. He went over, he brought us back a drink. Little shot glasses with a pretty design in 'em. And we just toasted in silence. Great sale, shelley. Great. = fuck! Send me out! Come on, give me leads! Williamson! Send me out! - The leads are coming. - Get 'em to me. Yeah, I talked to Mitch and Murray an hour ago. They're coming in. You understand, they're a bit upset over this. Did you tell 'em my sale? How could I tell 'em your sale? I didn't have a tele, I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads, all right shelley? We had a little, you closed the deal, you made a good sale. Fine. Better than a good sale. I have a lot of things on my mind, you understand? They're coming and they're very upset. I'm trying to make... All I'm telling you is you can tell them it was a remarkably good sale. The only thing remarkable about it is who you made it to. What the fuck does that mean? If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle. = if it sticks? Why shouldn't the sale stick? Oh, fuck you. You do not know your job, do you know that? A man is his job! You are fucked at yours. You hear what I'm saying to you? Your end of the month fucking boar, you do not know how to run this office. You haven't got the sense, you haven't got the balls. Have you ever been on a sit? Has this cocksucker been on a sit? Did you ever sit... If I were you, I would calm down. Oh, would you? What are you gonna do, fire me? Oh, oh, Rick, ooh. - It's not impossible. - Oh, really? On an $80,000 day? And what, it's not even noon yet. You closed 'em today? Oh, I got up early this morning, I tracked 'em down, and I closed it. What I'm saying to you is that things change, and that's where you fuck up, because you don't know. You can't look back. You don't see who's coming. Maybe it's someone new, huh? Maybe it's someone else, but you don't know, you can't look back, because you don't know your history! When we were on rio rancho, who was the top man, huh? For what, two months, three months? How about eight months, for three years in a row, huh? And on what, luck? Was that it, John? Or purloined fucking leads? It was talent! Yes, = door to door. It's called cold calling, John. Shit, I don't even know their name, they don't want to buy what I've got. Soft sell, shit, we were doing it before we even had a name for it, am I right? You're right, you're right, shel. You wouldn't know, you, he doesn't even know what a streak is. What the hell are you? You're a fuckin' secretary. Fuck you! Yeah, that's my message to you. Fuck you and kiss my ass. And if you don't like that, baby, I go across the street and 1 speak to Jerry graff, period. Fuck you. Now listen to me, you put me on that fucking board, and I want three promising leads for today, I don't want any bullshit about 'em, and I want 'em close together, because I am gonna close them all. And that's all I have to say to you. He's right, Williamson. I'm sorry, but it's wrong, and you know whose fault it is? Mitch and Murray. The hell with him. Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick? The leads won't be up here till later anyway. = you're a client. I just sold you five waterfront glengarry farms. I do this with my hair, throw me the cue, "kenilworth." - Which is it? - Kenilworth. I own the property. My mother owns the property. I put her into it. You look on the plats, you go home. You'll see. A-3 through 10, 26 through 30. Take your time, if you still feel you wanna... Oh, I won't need more time, Rick. I've bought a lot of property. I've gotta talk to you. Jim, what are you doing here? Jim lingk, d. Ray Morton. I'm glad to meet you. I just put Jim into black creek. Are you acquainted with... = black creek? No. Ooh, in Florida! Yes, I meant to speak to you about that. = we'll do that this weekend. My wife suggested I look into it. Yes, beautiful, beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and jinny. Ray, I gotta tell you something, ray. You eat in a lot of restaurants, ray? I know you do. Ray is with American express. Can I tell Jim what you do? Sure. Ray is the director of all European sales and services for American, what I'm saying is, you haven't had a meal until you've tasted, I was at the lingks'.

Come on, let's hustle. John! Get on the phone to Pittsburgh, American express there, for Mr. Morton, will ya? Tell them he's on the one o'clock. I'll see you. Oh, Christ, I'm sorry you came all the way in. I'm running ray to the airport. You wait here and, no, I can't. I'm meeting your man at the back. I wish you'd have phoned!

I promised him five weeks ago that I would go to the wife's birthday party in kenilworth tonight. I have to go, you understand? They treat me like a member of the family. I have to go.

I'll take you to lunch. Where would you like to eat? My wife... = Rick? I can't talk now, Jim, I'll call you tonight, all right? Sorry, coming, ray. My wife said I have to cancel the deal. That's a common reaction, Jim, and let me tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. No, it's a sizable investment. One thinks twice. It's also something women have. Reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, you invite me to dinner again, this woman can cook. Oh, I'm sure she can. We're gonna talk. I wanna tell you something. I can't talk about it here, and I really shouldn't, and by law, the man next to you bought his lot at 42, phoned to say he already had an offer. Hey Rick. I'm coming. Ray, what a day. I'll call you this evening. Jim, I'm sorry you had to come all the way in. I'm sorry, Monday lunch. - We really have to go. - All right, Monday! She called the consumer, the Attorney General?

It's not a business day. I am not counting it. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, so it would have elapsed. What would have elapsed? If we wait till Monday, it would have elapsed! When did you write the check? Yesterday. What was yesterday? Tuesday. = and when was that check cashed? = t don't know. What was the earliest it could have been cashed? = t don't know. Today. Today. Which, in any case, it was not, as there was something on the agreement I wanted to go over with you, in any case. = it wasn't cashed? I just phoned downtown, it's on their desk. = Rick. = one moment. One point, in fact, of which I spoke to you of which, I can't talk to you about it here. - Levene! - Listen to me. The statute is for your protection. I have no complaint with that. In fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it. So quite the opposite. It says, "you can change your mind three working days "from the time the deal was closed." Levene! = wait a second! Which is not until the check is cashed! I'm through with this fuckin' meshugaas. Nobody should talk to a man that way. How are you talking to me that way? Levene! How can you talk to me that way? I'm gonna flag a cab. = t didn't Rob... - Shelley. - I didn't. Shelley, get in the office. Where were you last? Is anybody listening to me? Where's moss? = is this levene? Perhaps I could assist you with that. Excuse us, will you? =I'm in here. Ti work here!

We have people trying to do business. = that's what I came in here for. That's what I'm trying to do! I meet gestapo tactics. Excuse me. I meet gestapo tactics! I meet gestapo tactics. That's not right. No man has the right. No man has the right. "Call an attorney," that means you're guilt, that means you're under sus, he says, "cooperate or we'll take you downtown."

We don't have to do that. = she told me I have to. No, Jim. =I do. Listen, I do, if I don't get my money back... Roma, I'm talking to you. = listen. Will someone get this guy off my back, please?

What does that mean? What? What? Say the words. I don't have the power. Okay, I said it. What power? To negotiate. To negotiate what? To negotiate what? = this. What this? = the deal. = the deal? Forget the deal, Jim. You got something on your mind, what is it? What? I can't talk to you. You met my wife. What? Aw... I met your wife, what? What, Jim? Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

Forget the deal, Jimmy. Forget the deal. The deal is dead. You know me, the deal's dead. Am I talking about the deal? That's over. Please, let's talk about you. I'm gonna tell you something. Your life is your own. You have a contract with your wife, you have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there. And there are other things, and those things are yours. And you needn't feel ashamed. You needn't feel that you're being untrue, or that she would abandon you if she knew. This is your life. Yes?

Your contract went out. Nothing to worry about. John, John. = your contract went out to the bank. You cashed my check? = Mr. Williamson. The check was cashed, the contract was filed and deposited in the bank, and we're completely insured in any case, as you know. = you cashed the check? Not to my knowledge, no. Though I'm sure we can... Not to my knowledge. Oh, Christ. Don't follow me, just don't follow me, okay? I've let you down. I know I've let you down. I'm sorry, forgive me. I don't know anymore.

To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living, you fairy. You company man. I'll tell you something else, I hope you ripped the joint off. I can tell our friend here a little something might help him to catch you. You wanna learn the first rule you'd know if you ever spent a day in your life? You never open your mouth till you know what the shot is. You fucking child. You are a shithead, Williamson. Can't think on your feet, you ought to keep your mouth closed. Can you hear me?

Because your partner depends, I'm talking to you, trying to tell you something. - You are? - Yeah, I am. What are you trying to tell me? What roma was trying to tell you. What I told you a long time ago. You don't belong in this business. You might listen to me. One day you could say, "hey, maybe the guy," oh, fuck it. Listen to me now. Your partner depends on you. Your partner, the man who is your partner, depends on you, and you go with him and for him or you're shit, huh? You are shit, you can't exist alone. Excuse me. Excuse you nothing! You be as cold as you want. You just fucked a good man out of $6000 and his goddamn bonus because you didn't know the shot. You can do that and you're not man enough ti don't know what. If you can't take something from that, then you're scum! You're fuckin' white bread. A child would know it, he's right. If you're gonna make something up, John, be sure that it helps. Hmm? Or keep your mouth shut. I'm done with you. How do you know I made it up? What? How do you know I made it up? What are you talking about, huh?

You wanna go in there? I tell him what I know, he's gonna dig up something. You got an alibi last night, shelley? You better have one! What did you do with the leads? If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk. Well I don't know what the hell you're talking about. If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in. If you don't, I'm gonna tell the cop you stole them. Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail, believe me, they will. Now, where are the leads?

But whatever it takes, John, to make things right, we're gonna make it right. We are going to make it right. I want to tell you something, shelley. You have a big mouth. What? You've got a big mouth! And now I'm gonna show you an even bigger one. Where are you going? Hey, you can't do that! You don't want to do that. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's $2500. Go ahead and take it, take it all.
