[laughing] [sobbing] [bell tinkling] [bell rings] [bell ringing] I'm sorry to keep you waiting. That's all right. Er, cigarettes. -What kind? -Players. Give me 20 Players. What place is this, then? -Llangollen. -Clan... Never mind. Do you know how far we are from Cardiff? About 30 miles, it's a straight road. Yeah, well, if it is, it'll be the first straight bit of road I've seen today. Well, ta. Bye. Bye. Oh, by the way, what... [bell tinkling] What I was going to ask was, where's the local pub? There isn't one. What, no pub? No, they closed it down, you see, after they shut the pit. There aren't many people left in the village now. They've all gone. I don't blame them. Where is the nearest? Well, I think that would be Marcelly, it's-- it's on your road. Ah, ta. Well, then... bye again. Bye. I'm off now, then. Remember, baby sitting's 10 shillings. 10 shillings for staying the night. Don't let her fob you off with five. No, Father. Tomorrow afternoon you'll go to your aunt's in Cardiff. We've been talking about... Oh, never mind, they'll tell you. You'll miss the bus if you don't hurry. Yes, Father. -Did you know what she said then? -No. She said, "But Doctor, I'm not even engaged." -[coughing] -Oh, careful now, careful. -[doorbell ringing] -Oh, she's here. Charles, give Ethel another sherry, will you? Thank you. -I know when I've had enough. -Oh, well. Oh, good. Come in. Right on time. I should take your case up right away, and have a look at the children. -They should be asleep. -Yes, Mrs. Medwin. Come straight down, we'll have to get moving. Yes, Mrs. Medwin. [Mrs. Medwin] Are you sure you won't have another sherry, Ethel? [Charles] She will not. We don't want her singing all the way to Cardiff, you know. [Mrs. Medwin] Don't be too hard, dear, it doesn't become you. [Charles] Oh, I'm sorry, my dear, let me help you with that. [Ethel] I've managed it now, thank you. Oh, well, I'll just get my coat, then I think we're all set. One thing about Jennie, she is reliable. You don't have to worry about leaving the place, or the children. You can rely on her. -Well, that's half the battle, isn't it? -Exactly. Ah, Jennie. Children all quiet and comfy? -Yes, Mrs. Medwin. -Good, good. Oh, my husband may ring. I've left a pencil and pad by the telephone. It'll be long distance, so be sure to take down the message properly, won't you? -Yes, Mrs. Medwin. -We'll be back rather late. All right, dear? Yes, I hope you enjoy yourself. I'm sure we will. Oh, I've turned the television on for you. Good night, Jennie. [Both] Good night. Where's your boyfriend tonight, then? -I haven't got one, sir. -No? -The lads of the village must be slipping. -[Ethel] Charles?

Well, get yourself out of there and get downstairs, I'll... I'll talk to you later. My clothes, they're on the bed. You'd better come and get them, then, hadn't you? Thank you. My slippers, I was looking for them. Sorry. Mrs. Medwin said you wouldn't be home. I changed my mind. Good thing I did, too. Do you always, uh, carry on like this in other people's houses? 'Course, you... You know what I ought to do, don't you? I ought to put you across my knee and give you a damn good spanking. Mrs. Medwin has gone to a concert in Cardiff. Oh, I'm not going to chase after her, if that's what you mean. I've done enough driving for one day. I--I wasn't sure if you knew where she'd gone, you see. As a matter of fact, you know, this thing, uh, suits you. -What? -This, uh, negligee. I think it's lovely. Really lovely. -Mmm, suits you. -Honestly? Yes. I've never worn a negligee before. It really is lovely. I like nice things. Mmm, so I notice. You had a bash at the scent, too, didn't you? Well, I--I put a bit in the bath. I--I didn't use very much, truly. Oh, that's all right. We haven't got a bath at home, you see. We have a tub in the back room on Thursdays. Not Friday? No, Thursdays. It's early closing, you see. Oh, yes. You won't tell Mrs. Medwin, will you? No, I won't tell her. Anyway, she couldn't say very much, could she? I mean, it's no sin to take a bath. No. No. Oh, come on, now, don't tell me you've never been kissed. Eh? Go on. I bet you've been up in the hills with one or two of the local lads. I have not. I'd want something better than them, I should think. Look... Come and sit down a minute. Come on, now, come on. Uh, that was right, what you said? -You've never had a negligee? -Never. Well, there you are, then. Tomorrow you can buy a negligee of your own. With this. Five pounds? Mmm. Five pounds. Present, for a good girl. Oh... No, I couldn't take it. Really, I couldn't. Oh, go on. W-Where are you going, now? Well, uh... I'm going to get dressed. I can't walk about like this all night, can I? Thank you very much for the present. I really shouldn't take it. There is a condition. Oh? When you've bought the negligee, I want to see you in it. Oh, I don't think I'll get one of these. I think I'll get a new spring coat. That is, if you don't mind. If you do... Look... You're not angry? [sighing] No. Well, that's all right, then. [sighs] Never mind. I'm going downstairs for a drink. Your slippers. You forgot your slippers. [sighs] [birds chirping] It's all right, you can look now. It's all over. -What did she say? -She said, it's done. -It's done, is it? -Yes, it's done. Well, that might perk it up for a day or two. But it'd be kinder to put her to sleep. What did he say? You should have Flossie put to sleep, Auntie. Sleep? The gentleman has given Flossie some stuff to make her sleep. No, no. She should be put to sleep for her own sake. -She's very old. -Eh? Flossie's very old, Auntie. Yes, she's very old. The gentleman says Flossie's very old. I'll look in again later. Good afternoon. Sarah, have you spoken to her? -Not yet. -But you're going to? Yes, yes, yes. Don't interfere, be quiet. I'll do the talking. Oh, she'll make all the difference, all the difference in the world. -She's going, Sarah. -Shh. I've done all through the bedrooms and the kitchen, Auntie. What about your tea? Oh, that's all right. I'm meeting my friend Violet, and I'll catch an early train. -[whispering] -Yes, all right, all right. Jennie, we, your Aunt Louisa and me, we wanted to ask you if you've made up your mind. About what? Your dad hasn't spoken to you? No. -Her dad hasn't spoken to her. -Shh. You sure? He didn't tell you about moving in here? Moving in? That's right, dear. Living here, to look after us. We spoke to him, you see. The shop's not doing well. Hardly a living for one, let alone two. He said it was a good idea. We've always been fond of you, Jennie. You're like our own child. Like our own daughter. You will have the gramophone, and the wireless. It's no life for you living where you are. I mean, we can be company for you. We can be company for each other. And my dad said I was coming? [Sarah] We thought he'd have told you. He said likely you'd come after Easter. [cat yowls] She's gone, Sarah. She's gone. She didn't answer. She didn't even say goodbye. Hey, Jen, look! You can have your name put on your panties, look! It's common. Yeah, soppy. I mean, what's the point? After all, you'd tell a fella what your name was before you let him get as far as that, wouldn't you? I'm fed up parading up and down, Vi. I'm not in the mood. No, you're not. You've made that obvious all afternoon. Oh, I'm sorry, it's what my aunts said. I couldn't go and live there. Everything's old. It stinks. The whole place stinks. You don't have to go? My dad has fixed it all up. The world's full of old people fixing our lives for us. I don't ever want to get old. Oh, never mind. It'll work out, lovely. Hey, Jen, those couple of fellas are still watching us. Don't look! We don't want them to think we're interested. She's just what I need. -Well, supposing I fancy that one? -Eh? Well, last time I got the bird with the fat legs and big teeth. I want first pick this time. Yeah, well, I'll tell you what we do, boyo. We play it by ear. They're just kids. I fancy a man who's more, sort of, mature. I think you get more respect from an older man. Not the older men I've met, Jennie. The older they get, the worse they get. Uh, excuse me. Did you say Jennie? Come on, Vi, I ought to think about my train. Well, you made a right old mess of that. Now what do we do? Wait here for a couple of mature men? I just don't like being picked up, that's all. I think it's common. It's all right for you. You can afford to pick and choose. Why don't you look where you're going? Pardonnez-moi, mademoiselle. Allow me. [chuckles] Well, look who's here. Well, you remember me, don't you? In the shop, yesterday. You remember. I remember you, pet. I certainly remember you. Oh, this is a lovely place! Don't you think so, Jennie? Yes, it's very nice. They must have done it up since we were here last. Eh? Do you come here a lot, then? Oh, I always stop here when I've got business in Cardiff. It's the best hotel in the place. It costs a packet, mind you, but, uh, I like the comfort. Getting old, you know. Well, now, sweetheart, w-what'll you have? Oh, I don't know. What are you having, Jennie? I don't know. Do you know, I think I fancy a glass of champagne. [coughs] C-Champagne? If the little lady wants champers, champers it is. Same for you, darling. Uh...yes! Y-Yes, please. Yeah, well I'll be back in two shakes of a dog's tail. Don't go away, now. I--I'll come and give you a hand. Hey, you've got a nerve, asking for champagne. Why not? We don't want them to think we don't know, do we? No. A bit of luck, meeting them. This is a super place. The way you talk, as if you've never been in a place like this before. I haven't. Well, try and look as if you have, will you? Nah, they'll be okay when we get them warmed up a bit. I've come across dolls like that before. Put a finger on their knee and they scream blue murder. It's just a question of getting them warmed up. Well, what on? Champagne? She's got big ideas, that one has. Relax, sonny, relax. How about this, sir? -Yeah, how much? -Ten shillings a bottle. There you are, what did I tell you? They'll never know it from the real thing. Right, um, shove it in a bucket, will you, old man? -You know, with ice, all the trimmings. -Very good, sir. [playing up-tempo music] [Jennie laughing] [laughing] Anyone ever tell you you was a cracker, pet? [drunkenly] What, me? Yes, you, darling. A cracker. You're just saying that. I'm not, you know. You're good enough to eat. As a matter of fact, I'm working up quite a nice little appetite. -[laughing] No! -No, what? Behave yourself. Why? I don't know. You might have a wife at home for all I know. Wife? I mean I don't want my... I don't want my eyes scratched out. Don't be silly, darling. I haven't got caught yet, you know. Well, I was only saying there was a girl in the car. Oh! You mean Maggie! Yeah, she's one of our models. -Model? -Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm in the advertising game, you see, and, uh, well, I had to bring her down to do a couple of commercials. TV? Yeah, well, we do a bit of all sorts, you know. TV, films, magazines, the lot. It must be very interesting. Ah, it's all right. It's got its drawbacks, same as everything else. [laughing] [music ends] [all chattering] [balloons popping] Let's go and have another drink, eh? No, I must be getting on. I ought to go. What time is it? Oh, it's early yet. Well, I've got a train to catch. Oh, it's too early to start worrying about trains, besides, I'll drive you back. Well, if you're sure it's not too much trouble. Trouble? Don't be silly, darling, it'll be a pleasure. Mind you, I'd rather be taking you to Paris. [squeals] Do you know what? I don't think you're entirely nice to know, Mr. Andy, whatever-your-name-is. [laughing] [whooping] [Andy shouting] All right, ladies, step into my... No, no, no, listen! I'm by the driver! I'm by the driver! All right, don't need to be rude. Anyone would think it was your car! What are you coming for, anyway? She's coming along for the ride, aren't you darling? All set?

Safe at home, I expect, we dropped her off. Did you have a good night? Whose place is this? Mine. It's not bad, eh? I--I've just made a cup of char, I'll go and pour it out. Here we are. Here, mind, it's hot. It's made with hot water. Why... Why didn't you take me home, same as Violet? We couldn't find your village, darling. Anyway, you wouldn't go. Who... W-What happened? How did I... Don't ask me, love. I just shoved the pair of you in there and shut the door. It wasn't your first time, was it? Well, was it? Ah, well. You know, c'est la vie, as the French say. [crying] What am I going to say? What am I going to tell them at home? Tell them you're a big girl now. Look, l--I've got to get weaving. There's some... There's grub in the kitchen if you want it, help yourself. And the, uh, the you-know-what's through there. You can't leave me. Well, I appreciate the compliment, darling, but I've got work to do. I've got to live, you know. -Where's Andy? -He doesn't live here, love. Where is he? I've got to see him. He said he'd meet you in The King & Queen, at 1:00. That's a pub off the Edgware Road. Where are we? Oh, blimey, didn't he tell you? You're in the big city now, girl. You're in London. [bell tolling] [man] Try the lounge bar. Hmm? Along there, far end. He might be waiting in there. Thank you. [people chattering] [men laughing] No luck? He's not shown up, then? No. Oh. Well, what time did you arrange? 1:00, but... I was a bit late, I got lost. I don't know my way around London. Yeah, it is a bit of a maze if you don't know it. He might have got held up himself, you know. Look, why don't you sit down and have a drink? Come on. No, I... Come on. All right. What would you like? Sherry? No, thank you. Oh, come on, have something. Cheer yourself up. I'll bring you a sherry, okay? All right. Sherry, thank you. Shan't keep you a second. You don't waste much time, do you? -What? -I've got eyes in my head, you know. I have got eyes. Oh, do you mean that girl? Do you mean her? Oh, come on, she only wanted a sherry. A sherry, is that all she wants? We can soon satisfy her then, can't we? [old man] And you've got as much right to be here as anyone else. Watch him, he's started again. Right. You two can't go till I buy you a drink. Now, now. Sit down, the both of you. -Now, sit down till I buy you a drink. -Come on, Paddy. Paddy, come on. No, I can't go till I've bought my friends a drink. Yeah, tomorrow will do. -Come along, Paddy. -Ah, there's me darling girl. Can't I wait, and buy her a drink? Come along. I meet a lovely woman. Can't I wait and buy her a drink? There you are, cheerio. [Eccles] No, I'm seriously thinking of writing to the papers about that. I mean that building is an historic monument. To pull it down would be vandalism. Afternoon, Mr. Eccles. Afternoon, Robert. After all, there aren't so many 16th-century manor houses left, man. There you are. Thank you. How much do I owe you? Oh, on the house. -No, really. -On the house. If you say so. I do say so. But no sign of your friend yet? No. I don't know what I'll do if he doesn't come. I was relying on him. Oh? About a job. Well, what do you do, then? [stammers] Actually... I'm a model. I--I do modeling. For--For artists and that? Do you-- Do you sort of pose? Really, do I look that sort? [chuckles] Well, no, but, uh... No, clothes. I model clothes. You know, gowns and dresses. I see. I'd better get on with my job. Thank you for the sherry. My pleasure. -Afternoon, Mr. Eccles. -Bye, Rob. You know, you can tell you've been a sailor. I mean, the way you row. Oh, you don't get much chance to do this at sea. You must have been to hundreds of places. Oh, I've been around a bit. Um... India, South America, Australia, United States. Hollywood? You haven't been to Hollywood, have you? Oh, yes, of course. Gosh. No, of course not. I'm hoping to emigrate to Australia. You're not. Yes, I am. I'm saving up to give myself a good start. I've never fancied Australia. When you get there, will you send me a postcard? Yeah, you try and stop me. Tell you what, better still, send me back a kangaroo. [Violet] She wasn't home at all? You didn't get a message or nothing? -[Father] No. -[Violet] Aren't you going to do something? No. If she wants to go joyriding in cars, drinking. The farther away from me she is, the better. But--But you can't just leave her! Can't I? But--But you don't know what will happen to her. I know exactly what will happen to her, and I shan't lose a minute's sleep over it. If she's gone to London, she better stay there. We got half-an-hour yet. We can wait here. Sure you wouldn't like a drink? I'm all right. -Something to eat? -No. Uh, Jennie... Don't think I'm butting in, I mean, tell me to mind my own business, if you like, but... What I'm trying to say is... You're not in any kind of trouble, are you? You'd tell me if you were? You'd let me help you? [train chugging] I don't see how anyone can help me. You are in trouble. Here. What is it? Tell me, please. I can't go home. Only... It's my father and... Yes? I can't stay here. I've got no money, and--and no friends. You've got me. Now, tell me what's wrong. It wouldn't be fair. And you couldn't help me, anyway. How do you know? Look, Jennie, I know you well enough to know that whatever it is... You can't say that. You only met me today. You don't know what sort of person I am. Yes, I do, Jennie. I do. Bob. Look, you'd better make up your mind. I'm going to help you whether you like it or not. [train whistle blowing] Come on, now. Out with it. I'm going to have a baby. Well, you wanted to know. You got it out of me. Why don't you get up and leave me, why don't you go? Don't worry, Jennie. Don't worry. Just a minute. Okay, come on. Oh, evening, Bob. Hello, Charles. -And good evening to you, my dear. -Good evening. Come on, Jennie. Oh, Bob, don't forget to watch the play on TV tomorrow night. I'm in it. -Oh? -Well, just, you know, three lines and a spit. This way, Jennie. Don't cough, or you'll miss me. [sighs] Here we are. Oh, it' very nice, Bob. Very nice. Well, it's not bad. I think it's marvelous. All these books, are they yours? Yeah, most of them. I get one new book every month. I love a good read. There's nothing to beat it, I'd say. "The Origin of the Kiss." Well, it's a scientific book, really. I bet. Well, it explains... Look, it traces the history of the human kiss. I'd rather not know. Oh. Let's take your coat. Thank you. Hey. Your curtain's torn. You would notice that. I've been meaning to see to it. Well, you've got better things to do, I should think. You find me a needle and thread and I can fix that in no time. Doesn't matter. I'm going to sew that curtain before I leave here. After all you've done for me, it's the least I can do. Okay. -Where are you going? -To fill the kettle. That man, on the landing, -is he an actor? -Yeah. From the films? Uh, yeah. Films and telly. I--I don't know him very well. Oh, look, you're tired. I'm okay. You're tired. Lie down and try to get some sleep. You've had a rough day. Well, what about you? I can't turn you out. You just do as you're told. Yes, Bob. [Mrs. Jessop] Mr. Williams! Yes, Mrs. Jessop? [panting] Oh. They'll kill me, these stairs. They'll be the death of me one of these days. Is anything wrong? Well, you're the best judge of that, young man. You've got a visitor. Yeah. A friend of mine. -She looks like a whore to me. -Now, look here, Mrs. Jessop. Don't you get on your high horse with me, young man. Is she proposing to stay the night? -It's not what you think. -And don't tell me what to think. I knew you were up to something by the way you crept in. All right, she's a poor kid. She's got... I couldn't care less. Now, look, you rent a single room here... -Yeah, but... -Remember that, not a double. -I know, but-- -Not a double one. So you can't expect it for the same rent, can you? Wouldn't be honest. Look. She'll be here for one night. Two at the most. I charge four pounds for a double room. 30 shillings more than you pay. I'll settle at the end of the week. I'd rather you settle now, thank you. There, will that satisfy you? 30 shillings, please. Not 20. Oh, she'll be here for one night. My terms are by the week, or part of a week. That's better. Now we're square. Careful of that bed, it won't take too much weight. [mutters] [clicks] [book clatters] [coin clatters] What's the matter? It's all right, the fire's gone out. It just needs another shilling. You're cold. No. You're shivering. No, it's all right. Just a bit chilly. Here, take one of these blankets. No, I'll be all right. You go to sleep, go on. Come on, take one. Whoever made this bed, made it to last. Here, let me give you a hand. Come on. Jennie. You're blushing. No, I'm not. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's better than being the other way. Isn't it funny how moonlight makes everything seem different? Sort of...softer. We could be anywhere, now, really. Sailing on a yacht in the Mediterranean. Or on a desert island. Or in this great palace... made of gold. We could be anywhere. [sighs] We could be anybody. I could be...a countess, or the wife of some fabulous millionaire, or a film star. A fabulous film star in her boudoir in Hollywood. Now you're laughing at me. You think I'm soft. No, I don't. I think you're wonderful. I love you, Bob. I truly love you. [train whistle blowing] [exclaims] Oh, just a minute. Let me look. [Mrs. Jessup] Yes? It's Bob. Bob Williams. Come in. Ah, Mr. Williams. Come in, come in. Shut the door. Oh, thank you. Four pounds again this week. Our little miss is becoming a permanent fixture, is she? Well, um... She'll be staying a few more days, yes. My first floor front will be vacant next week. I shall be sorry to lose him. He's a gentleman. Would you be interested? Uh, I'm not sure. Well, it has a double bed. You can't be comfortable on a single, two of you. Or hasn't the novelty worn off yet? I...I'll let you know. Well, I'll give you the first refusal. My husband always insisted on the big bed. Yes, he liked a big bed. Well, I've got to get on. Thank you. Right. Um, I'll let you know about the room. All right, then. Okay, mate, thanks. -Well, that's it, Ella. -Right. God, it's warm work. Here we are. Ah, just the job. [exhales] Thank you, love. Mm. I, uh... I haven't heard you mention Australia lately. You are still going, I suppose? Yeah, I expect so, one day. Oh, I... I just wondered. Now that you've taken up with this girl. Well, if I have anything to do with it, she'll be coming with me. Serious then? This is it, as they say? Yeah, this is it. Oh, she's a wonderful kid, Ella. You should see what she's done to my room for a start. I'm sure she'll make a very good wife for you, Bob. Ahh... [humming] Can I come in? -Mr. Boyce. -Oh, Charles, please. Charles. Or, if you prefer it, Charlie. I prefer Charles. I'll let you into a little secret, so do I. Guess. You've run out of milk again. Again. I've heard all about you actors. What do you mean? Never mind, I've heard that's all. Thank you. Delicious smell of coffee. Would you like some? There is plenty, it only has to be heated up. It's the best offer I've had this month. Thank you. Sit down, won't be a jiff. Oh, there's no hurry, I'm resting this week. Oh, something'll turn up. I'm going to a big party tonight, might pick up something there. Oh, well, something will turn up. Now then, Ella, when are you going to come up to the studio and let me paint you? Two large Scotches, there. [all chattering] Thank you. -Here we are Mr. Thomas. How's your garden? -Fine, thanks. Fine. -The old same again, please, Bob. -Ah, gin and... Mr. Baxter. One gin and tonic, please, Mrs. Pitt. -Ella? -Uh-huh, yes? About that little proposal I put to you. I'm rather anxious to know the verdict. I haven't got time to stop and talk now. Later. Bob? You've got company. Excuse me. I'm sorry. -Hello. -What are you doing here? I came to see you, Bob. Oh, come on. There's no need to be so rough, you're hurting my arm. What's the matter with you? Look, Jennie, I've asked you not to come to the pub. Couldn't you have waited? -I had to see you, it was urgent. -What about? It doesn't matter now. Oh, don't be silly, Jennie, if it was urgent! I told you, it doesn't matter now. Look, Jennie, I'm supposed to be working! Oh, well, don't let me interfere with that, if it's so important. Everything will go to rack and ruin if you don't work. Look, I'll be off at 3:00 for a couple of hours, I'll come back to our place and see you there. It can wait till then, can't it? I've told you, it doesn't matter now. Look, I'm sorry darling, but we are busy. I'll see you back at our place at 3:00, okay? If I'm there. Excuse me. Where the hell do you think you've been? Customers are going mad for their drinks. They can bloody well wait five minutes, can't they? [bartender] Two bitters, over there. [man] Watch out where you're going, you clod! All right, you clear that lot up. I'll do this. -Come over here, sir. I'll just wipe that... -Look at the damn thing! Jennie? [knocks] Charlie? [water running] Jennie, are you there? Is that you, Jennie? Jennie, what are you doing? Washing your shirts, if you must know. Sorry, darling. I didn't mean to upset you, I'm sorry. Mind, you'll get all wet. No, I shouldn't worry. When you said... When you said you might not be here, it so turned me over, I couldn't think of anything else, I don't know what I've been doing, I dropped a tray, I gave three people the wrong drinks. Oh, Jennie! You silly oaf, you don't think I meant it, do you? I do beg your pardon. [both snickering] Hey. Come upstairs. What about these? They can wait. What's the time, Jen? You too lazy to look at the clock? Quarter past 4:00. I've got to get back by 5:00. You never told me what you wanted to see me for. It doesn't matter, it's not important. Oh, come on, you said it was urgent. It was. Are you going to get up for this? [groans] Yes, I suppose I'd better make a move. Do you want to know? What? What I came to see you for? Oh, if you like. Well, I've got the chance of a job, modeling. That's all, I've got to try and earn whilst I can and get a bit put by. I was talking to this actor friend of yours, Charles, as a matter of fact. When was this? Oh, this morning, he came up to borrow some milk. Up here? Charles was in here? Does it matter where it was? Let me get it out, please. Well, go on. Well, he's going to this party tonight, and he...he said there'd be a lot of agents and people there. And he said I could go along with him and meet them. Charles says that's the only way to get in, is to meet them, sort of privately, like. Huh. What does that mean? You're not going, Jen. Who says so? I say so. Since when have I taken orders from you? Look, if you go to that... Yes? Look, Jennie, I'm only telling you... I know. And I don't like it. Anyway, you can put your mind at rest. I can't go, I've got nothing to go in. That was why I wanted to see you. I wanted to get some money to buy a dress. Well, waste of time dressing up for those sort of parties. Girls always finish up with nothing on, anyway. Oh, very funny! Oh, come on, Jennie. Don't maul me! You're all the same, you get what you want and you don't care about anyone else! It doesn't matter about me, what I want! Do you know what you want? Yes, I do! I want to get on. I want to make something of myself, be somebody! Look. Look, is she any better than me? -Oh, Jennie... -Is her bust any better than mine? Answer me, I'm asking you! You'd knock spots off her, Jennie. Right. So she's the same age as me, she's been in five films already! On television and everything, and do you know where she is now? Sunning herself on the French Riviera! And you want that? I want something! I want something good to happen to me before I die! I don't know, Jennie, I... I just don't understand. [train chugging] Look at it. Just look at it. I used to dream about London. It's funny when you think about it. Sometimes I used to watch television at my friend's house. -I used to sit there glued to that set. Glued to it! -Jennie... In the plays, even in the adverts, people had such fabulous things. Houses with dozens of rooms, and lovely furniture, and terrific bathrooms, and swimming pools, and long white cars, enormous white cars. People drinking champagne on aeroplanes. Aeroplanes going all over the world. And the women in such fabulous furs. l saw a film once where the girl had a wardrobe the whole length of one room, with hundreds of dresses in it. [train whistle blowing] And then you switch off. And you're back in the village. Or you've got this. So, that's it. So, that's what you want. I want some of it. I want my share. Why do they show us these things if we're not meant to have them? Jennie, I love you. And as far as I'm concerned, you are somebody. Well, that helps a great deal. The barman thinks I'm somebody. That's bound to get my picture in the papers. How much do you want? For that dress. Here's ten pounds. Ten pounds. [band music playing] [screams] Come on, come on. Hello, George! I'll be right with you. I beg your pardon. Champagne, madam? Thank you. Michael, darling! Carole, angel, how are you? I swore I'd cut you dead the next time I saw you. Well, why? What have I done? You went to Rome without me. Darling, I was five days on an epic, I was working. They threw me to the lions. Really? I hope the money was good. Don't talk about money, sweetheart, it makes me feel like a tire. Edgar, darling! Here you are, lovely. Oh, thank you. -Thank you very much. -All right. [all chattering] And nobody asked you, darling? Well, even if they did, I still couldn't afford it, dear heart. Never mind, darling, there's always Stratford, of course. Well, that may be. All agents are the same, Duckie. I thought you knew that. Well, I don't know. Only I'm sure he liked my audition. -I'm sure he hooked... -Even I thought I was very good. "What's my name?" I said. "You have the nerve to stand there and ask me my name?" I mean, after 18 weeks on the road with Private Lives. We slept together five nights out of seven, and he can't even remember my name. -Hi. -Hi. [hiccups] Sorry, manners. Oh, granted, darling! You are not in the rat race, I take it? -Pardon? -All this. Uh... No, um... Actually, I'm a model. Oh, darling, you're just what I need. Why don't you come back to my place? I'll show you my press cuttings, and then we'll make beautiful love together. No, thank you. Excuse me, darling, I must find somebody more pliable. I get neurotic if I don't have a balanced sex life. K.D.'s here. K.D.'s here. K.D.'s here. -[woman] Who? -[man] Karl Denny, you know the man... He's the boss. [all clamoring] [all singing] ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ And so say all of us ♪ And so say all of us ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow♪ ♪ And so say all of us [all cheering] No glass? [all laughing] Oh, what's keeping you from your lady love tonight? She's seeing someone about a job. -Oh, yes? -Yep. She's a model, you know. -Oh, really, a model? -Yep. That's where she's gone tonight. She's seeing this man about getting fixed up with a job. Oh. Well, if you're not in a hurry tonight, would you fancy coming for a cup of tea? Seems a long time. Only if you fancy it, I mean. All right. Why not? [both] Good night, Mrs. Pitt. Good night, dear. -[Bob] Good night, Mr. Pitt. -Good night. Oh! [Ella] It's all right, I've got the umbrella. Do you have to do that? I'm in the middle of counting. Wait a minute, did you speak to Bob? -Not yet, not yet. -Well, he was worse tonight. His work's gone to pot. If you don't tell him, I will. I'll do it, but he's got to be done right. If we rub him up the wrong way, he'll walk out. It comes to something when you've got to crawl to the staff. Well, that's how it is. If he walks out, well, you try finding another man. I should have done that years ago. A pity you didn't. -Where are you going? -Bed. Why, want to come? No, thanks. I gave that up a long time ago. Anyway, where would you get the energy? That was quick. Yeah, they are quick in these places, aren't they? Yes, I suppose so. Mind you, I prefer service myself, you know, personal service. Oh, so do I. Every time. -That's what counts. -Exactly. Personal service counts. Sugar? I shouldn't really. Oh, go on, you've got nothing to worry about. Yeah, I would if I didn't watch it, though. Well, here we are, then. Hmm? You have got it bad. I hope I get an invite to the wedding. Wedding? Oh yeah, you'll be there, don't worry. Well, there is going to be a wedding, isn't there? -Nothing's wrong, is it? -No. Well, yeah, there... There is a bit of a complication. Well, what is it? Oh, no, I mustn't be nosey. Oh, I don't mind telling you. Well, you ought to know you can trust me by now. Well, Jennie's going to have a baby. Well, you have been and done it, haven't you? I thought you were one of the clever ones. Oh, it isn't mine. I mean, it happened before I met her. You mean to sit there and tell me you're going through with it? Well, what else can I do? All I can say is you must have got it bad. Poor old Bob. All the pain and none of the pleasure. I don't even know if she will marry me. I haven't asked her what... Well, I don't want her to think I'm doing it out of charity. But on the other hand, well, it stands to reason... She wouldn't look twice at me if...If things were normal. A girl like that could just take her pick. Well, she might be able to take her pick, but if she comes up with anybody half as good as you, she'll be lucky. Dead lucky. [loud music playing] We go. Go to the car. Michael, Michael. Yes, Mr. Denny? We're doing a new American musical, and I think there's something very good in it for you. Thanks very much, Mr. Denny. Who's that girl? Oh, I'll fetch her for you. You want to... No, no, no. What's she do? What's her name? I don't know her name. She says she's a model. Oh, give her this. I think I may be able to use her, too. -Tell her to call round some time. -Right. Tomorrow night, at 8:00. For you. What is it? A royal command, sweetheart. You've been noticed. Mr. Denny? Yes, he wants you to call around there tomorrow night at 8:00. What for? Oh, sweetie! Either you're a bloody good actress, or you're a lot more conniving... I think he looks nice. Yes, very. Just a great big, warm, sentimental, cuddly teddy bear, with a heart like a cement mixer. -Shall we dance? -Yeah. What? Night! Goodnight, darling. Goodnight! Bob. Hello, Jennie. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. Oh, in all that rain. Dear old Bob. Lovely old Bob, waiting for Jennie. Well, you've had a few, haven't you? Oh, Bob's in a bad mood. You can tell, Bob's in a bad mood. Jennie, who was that? Whoops! Well, never mind, come on. [drunkenly] Come on, come on. Come on, Bob. It was wonderful! We had real champagne. And we were dancing on an actual stage. -[shouts] It was marvelous! -Shh, Jennie, all the people are asleep. Shh, all the people are asleep. [shouts] All the people are asleep! -[shushing] -Hello, Bob. Come on, come on, all the way, all the way up. [Jennie shouting] For heaven's sake, Jennie! Oh, it's Charles! Oh, dear Charles! You got back safe, then? Darling, Charles. Thank you for a wonderful party! -No, we're all going to bed. -Party. -Beautiful, beautiful party. -Now, come on, Jennie. That's enough, dear. See you tomorrow, Charles! -Yes, good night. -Good night. Jennie, for heaven's sake, you'll get us turned out. Thrown out of here? Think themselves lucky we stay here, stinking rotten hole! Jennie, Jennie, shut up! Whee! Whee! Well, say something. What? Oh, yes, very nice. Very nice? Somebody told me I looked beautiful. One woman thought I'd got it in Paris. I didn't say that I got it off the peg in Oxford Street. Did you get a job? -[glass breaking] -Oh. [Jennie shouting] Hello, Bob. It was marvelous! -Goodnight, Jennie, Jennie. -Oh, you're sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. Oh, no, Bob. No, you're all wet and you'll spoil my hair. Would you unzip my dress, please? [humming] You see, I've been very economical. I bought the dress and the undies and the shoes, and I've got four shillings change. Oh, wonderful. Here you are. No, never mind, Jennie. No, no, no, it's your money, you must have it. -There, all square. -Thanks. Don't mention it. [sighs] Wonderful bed. Hey. And where am I supposed to kip? Oh, Bob. You sleep on the chair tonight. I want to stretch. Your turn. You mean we haven't finished? No, we're only half-way through the second game. The first was enough for me. Look, Jennie, if only you concentrated. Look, watch that girl over there. So, what do we do now? Cheer? Oh, come on, I give up, you're the winner. Of course, it's still raining. Oh, am I fed up with this weather! We can get a cup of tea here. We spend our lives drinking tea. I won't be a minute. Here we are. We could go up the West End afterwards. See a new picture. Cheer you up. Don't be sarcastic, it doesn't suit you. Look, I don't get you. I mean, last night we're all laughing and singing, today you're... Well, go on, say it. Well, you got to admit it, you're like a bear with a sore head. Jen, I think we ought to get married. Yes? No, I mean, married. You and me. I heard you. See, what I mean is, if we get married right away, it won't matter about the baby, see? Everybody'll think it's mine and I won't say any different. There's a bigger room going at the house and we could move in there for a while. What brought this on all of a sudden? Oh, it's not all of a sudden, Jen. Ever since you told me about the baby I've been trying to work something out. I spoke to Ella about it. Ella? At the pub? You talked to her about me? Yeah. Yeah, she's a good sort. Oh, she must have enjoyed that, she hates me. -Oh, don't be silly, Jen. -She hates the sight of me. And do you want to know why? She fancies you herself. Ella? Aw, go on, you're making it up. All right, ask her. And whilst you're at it, tell her I shan't be needing her assistance, thank you very much. What do you mean? There isn't going to be any baby. False alarm, as a matter of fact. When did you know? I've known for two or three days now. But you couldn't have, Jennie, I would... Well, aren't you glad? Yeah, yeah, of course I'm glad, it's... See, so you needn't marry me now. What are you talking about? It makes it easier, I want to. Jennie, will you? What about this movie, then? But you haven't answered my question. Well, you don't expect me to answer pat like that, do you? Well, when will you tell me? I don't know. Tonight, or tomorrow. Sometime. If we go now, what time will we be out? Oh, about half-past 7:00. Oh. Well, I've got to be somewhere at 8:00. It won't give me enough time. Somewhere? Where? I've got to see someone about a job. You never told me. Well, I've only just remembered, Bob. Don't make an issue out of it. It's Thursday. It's the one evening I have off in the entire week. I know, and I'm sorry, but I can't help it. You talk as if it was my fault. I tell you what. I'll see you back at the pub at nine, will that satisfy you? -Jennie, who is it you're going to see? -Oh, someone. Charles, is it Charles? Him, what do you take me for? -Well, some other man, then? -Might be. -Look, Jennie... -Don't grab hold of me. You might think you own me, but you don't. Where I go and what I do is my business. Quiet tonight, innit? What most people tend to overlook, Ella, is the advantage of security. [Ella] Yes, yes, that does mean a lot. Well, it means everything. Ella! Excuse me. Fill her up again, Ella. You're going it a bit tonight, aren't you, Bob? Well? Sorry. Sorry I spoke. No, wait. Make it a Scotch. Double. Thanks. What's the matter, Bob? What's gone wrong? [sighs] You know what they say, don't you? It's a long lane that has no turning. Bob, what do you make of Mr. Eccles? Do you know something? Now, don't laugh. He wants to marry me. Him? Yes, what do you think? You could do a lot worse. Do you think I should? He's got plenty of the ready, ain't he? -Yes... -Right, then you grab him while you can. Be like all the others, Ella, look after number one. Take what you can get. That young man's drunk. What was he saying to you? Nothing special. I see. I should be glad to take you away from all this, you know. What's wrong with all this? Well, it's... It's not quite the sort of place, is it? You don't seem to mind it. Anyway, who said anything about taking me away? Shouldn't take so much for granted, if I were you. Ella! [people laughing] [all] Good night, Karl. [man] Oh, Karl... Oh, leave him, darling, he can't hear anyway, he's, uh, busy. Yes, I expect he is. Oh, uh... Going in? Now, look, if I were you, I'd take him up on that. [telephone rings] Hello? Excuse me. Bob. Hello, Jennie. What are you doing here, spying on me? No. Oh, never mind. What do you want? Well, I was waiting at the pub like you said, see, and... I got worried. Go back to the room, I won't be much longer. I'll wait. You can't. Come in here. Now, come here, silly. There, satisfied? Go home and wait for me, Bob. Who is this man, Jennie? He's no one. He's just someone who can help me to get a job, that's all. Honestly. Well, how did you meet him? I...I met him at this party that Charles took me to. -Who gave you that money? -What? In your bag last night, there was a five-pound note. It's mine, I...I've had it for ages, ever since I left Wales. Then why did you want money from me for a dress? -I'll explain later. -No, Jennie, I've got to know. It's been going round and round in my head all day, and I've got to know. I brought the money with me from Wales, I asked you for some because I didn't want to break into it, that's all. Look, Jennie, how can I believe anything you say? -You lied to me about having a baby. -I didn't... You lied to me about being a model. You tell so many lies, you don't know when you're lying and when you're speaking the truth. I brought the money with me. It's the gospel truth, honestly. Where do you think I got it from? From this man, Denny. Why should he want to give me money? You tell me, Jennie. Oh, I see. So, I'm a prostitute now. [stammering] No, I didn't mean that, um... I don't know what I'm saying half the time. Look, Jennie, I love you so much. And this is how you show it. Oh, Jennie, please! Don't touch me. I'm sick of you and your soft hands mauling me. So, it's him. Him and this rotten mob. Yes. This rotten mob. I've got something they want. Well, they can have it. And they'll pay for it. Nothing's for nothing in this world. It's all business. All right, I'm in business. And it's no good you looking at me like a sick dog. You're nothing. You've always been nothing, and all you'll ever have is nothing. I'm done with you. Finished! Jennie? What's all this? Get out. Jennie. My...My arm, i-it's bleeding. Who was that young man, Jennie? -It was my brother, h-he heard I was... -Don't lie to me, Jennie. It was, he heard I was... Never lie to me, Jennie. Tomorrow we'll buy you some decent clothes. Then we'll have to find you somewhere to live. A mews cottage, perhaps. And a little car. You won't find me ungenerous, Jennie. You won't find me ungenerous. [bell clanging] [woman] What's going on? Ambulance is here, Doc. -Too late, Inspector. -Too late? I'm not a miracle man. Well, here. She must have taken the lot. [knock on door] Okay, come in. [bell tolling] You'll get my report this afternoon, Inspector. Thanks, Doc. Good morning, Inspector. Found this outside, sir. Nothing special in it. Compact, lipstick, small change. -No letters, anything like that? -No, sir. -Always had her fare home. -Yes, sir. And then there's this. A lot of telephone numbers, all men. Could be her friends. Could be. Shall I try any of them, sir? I can tell you what they'd say before you start. Sir? "Oh, yes, we knew her. We knew Jennie. "But there was nothing between us, "we were just good friends."
