You've sure done it this time. This is my reward. I slave all year long till my bones ache just so you won't starve... and for what? What are you staring at? Mama's baby. Quit it! Still won't give it a rest? Scoundrels! Can you afford to squander them? Get under there and pick them off the floor! Can't have any peace from your deviltries! All you're good for is wreaking havoc and squandering! God forbid you make yourselves useful and lend a hand once in a while! This place will turn to dust and ashes when I'm no longer around. Come and pour me some water! Do it! And what's the disagreement with the little one? Why do you keep tormenting the poor boy? Some brains you have to be picking on the runt of the family instead of behaving like brothers and watching over him! Now! You listen here! Either you come to your senses or I'll whip them into you with a stick! Do you understand? Do you understand or don't you? - You demons! - Yes! Well, good! Now get! Be gone from my sight! Get! What's to be done now? Don't you worry about what tomorrow brings. Let tomorrow worry about itself. Now... Off to bed. Come now, wake up before it gets dark again! You hear me? Wake up and get dressed! You have work to do! Hurry up if you want to get to eat first! - Stop eating. - Leave some for me! - Leave some for me. - No! You oaf! - You had enough! - No... - You already had enough, you oaf! - No, I didn't! You be careful not to wander off again! - Hey... Hey! - Give me some! No, leave me alone! Come on, just a bite! No! Hey! Hey! Enough, enough, enough! Here, catch! Hey! Give me back my shovel! - There! - Dig away! Hell's bells, child! - Where's your head at? - There's someone... Go set them on the table and make sure you don't break any more! Or we'll be eating them off the floor! - Mother! - Little devils! It's as if I'm talking to the walls! I keep wasting my breath and they keep doing whatever crosses their minds! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree! Do you know where they are? Yes. Go, fetch them back. And if they refuse, tell 'em they can spend the night outside. With the wild animals! I, for one, won't be letting them back inside! And be quick! I need a word with the three of you! Brother! Brother! Brother! Mama says you need to come home! Oh, boy! Say... What's the rush? Let go of me! I'm going to show Mother what you did to me! I'm gonna show Mommy, show Mommy! Show her what? That you threw that rock into... You lying little snitch! Did you see us throw any rocks? What are you doing? I'll give you something you can show Mommy! You little shitwit! Curses! Good day to you! Good day to you too! You scared me half to death! Just scared away the numbness. Numbness? As if there's ever time for anything of the sort? Say, then... what brings you about? Just passing through. Yesterday... a thick, dark cloud of smoke rose from your house. I figured... I better assume the worst and stop by to ask about your health. We're healthy, friend. We're healthy. And neither did our house burn down. You see, the granary caught fire. Burned to ashes! Along with everything in it! You don't say! How did that happen? It happened the way it happened. No point dwelling on it! What a waste! Surely it can't be easy... a woman on her own... Don't you worry, friend! It's not all that bad. Here... Don't worry, I got it. I have more than enough company. I'm hardly ever alone. I should consider myself lucky, then, catching you at such a time! You make your jokes, my friend, and I, for one, can't see the end of my chores! I know. You are a hardworking woman. No doubt about it. As God intended it to be! Caring for the household and for those born into it. But one can't help but wonder... shouldn't someone be caring for you? It doesn't seem right... a house without its man. My man, your friend, is long gone. Not to mention the age for such matters is gone. No. Those things are for the youthful! Come now... a sturdy woman such as yourself? You must forgive us, but there's not much left we can welcome you with! Next time, I'll make sure you find us with the table set and I'll be absolved of my sins! Say... where are the little rascals off to? How come I can't hear their voices? God only knows! You figure they'd let me know when or where they're off to? You remember what it was like being their age! They're being led by their feet, not their judgment. As long as they don't go around trespassing. That would be... That would be it! I'd tie them down! But don't you worry yourself. They never stay gone too long. Before you know it, they're led back by their hunger and you see them racing home. And I didn't even get the fire going. You be safely on your way! And if you ever catch any of them meddling where they shouldn't, you have my blessing to put their skin on a rod. I won't mind! That you can be sure of! No, ma'am. I, for one, gave my word I'd never bring any harm to your children. But you never know who they might rub the wrong way and end up as grist for the gossip mill. That's true... It is. Some things are harder... to bear than others... You listen to me well: Loneliness will drive a person mad. I'm sure. You stay safe now. And we'll see each other soon. Most certainly, yes! Good day to you! You be well! Lord have mercy! Which way did he go? This way! Come this way! I got dirt in my mouth! It's like he vanished into thin air. Come, leave him! Let's go! We won't find him! You'll come home sooner or later! We'll finish this then! There they are! What did I say? Was I talking to myself? Looking for a bruising again? What happened to your clothes? I'm leaving him in your care. Pay attention! I don't want to hear none about you torturing and tormenting him! I'll be back before nightfall. So try and keep out of trouble, at least for a few hours! Can I count on you? - Can I or can't I? - Yes, Mother! You don't have to worry. You have our word and our word is our bond. If that be the case... Come, then... Let us eat! Drag myself into town this time of year is what I needed! You're lucky it hasn't snowed yet! Or I'd have you go! Think you could have handled it? Men that you are? Would you have gone with them? Of course you wouldn't go to be harassed by them. Mother, would you tell us a story? Alright... There once was an old woman and an old man. The old woman had a hen and the old man a rooster. And the woman's hen would lay eggs all the time... We know this story! Tell us a new one! Yes! Well, alright! Once upon a time, there was a goat that had three kids. The firstborn and the second would cause nothing but trouble! Whilst the youngest was mild-mannered and hardworking. As goes the saying: there are five fingers on each hand none of them same as the other. One day, the goat calls upon her kids and tells them: My dear children, I shall go into the woods to bring us some more food... Three kids with knobbly brow Unbolt the door for Mother now Come and see the things she brings Leaves she tugs And milk in dugs Salt in a pack upon her back Maize-flour sweet between her feet Flower bunches on her haunches Lock the door behind me. Look after one another and under no circumstances are you to open this door unless you hear my voice! Where are you going to hide now? Aren't you going to cry? Hey! - Come here! - Where do you think you're going? After him! Let's go after him! What is it, are you scared? Come! Are you coming? Yes, make some room. You just wait for it! Truce? See anything? Nothing. Someone might have passed by. That was Mama's song. No! She told us not to open the door unless we hear her voice! That's not her! Who is it, then? I don't know... Please, don't open! Yesterday I saw someone at the top of the hill! It's not her... Who is it, then? That is not our mother! Please, don't open it or we'll be done for! Well, now... Am I not right when I say the world got flipped on its head ever since the tail became the head! Brother, please! Brother, please listen to me! Come here! Come! - Come here! - No! Woman... Laddie, laddie, laddie... There you are! Godfather! No! No! Godfather, no! I'm not sure... Is my mind playing tricks on me? Or did I hear more voices? Where could it be, where could it be? Three kids with knobbly brow Unbolt the door for Mother now Come and see the things she brings Leaves she tugs And milk in dugs Salt in a pack upon her back Maize-flower sweet between her feet Flower bunches on her haunches No! No! No! No! My baby! My baby! My sweet, sweet baby! My sweet baby! What happened here, child? What happened? We heard someone whistling outside... Who did you hear? ...and they rushed to open the door... For who, my love, for who? I tried to stop them, but they wouldn't listen to me and finally had their own way! And then? And then? Then I hid in the chimney and one got under the trough... and the other carelessly got behind the door after he pulled the door-latch. And? Our godfather! Stormed in on us! Who? Your friend... My babies... My babies... My babies... Let's get you into bed. Mama? Laddie, laddie, laddie. What's wrong, sweetheart? What happened? It's alright, it's alright... It's okay. It's alright. It's alright, baby, it's alright... It's alright. Come! Come quickly now! Come! There we go. There's nothing left of them. Nothing left... My poor, poor babies... My babies. My poor, poor babies. Rotten tramp! He knew me helpless... with a house full of children... ...and he desecrated my home. So be it! No deed goes unrewarded! Maybe it's better to leave it in God's hands. Don't you always tell us not to seek revenge, but leave room for God's wrath? Not this time, my dear! On your way to God, the saints will have your soul! You just remember what I tell you! If he's ever to step foot in here again... ...he'll get what's coming to him! Wretched swine! The nerve he had to come here and grin at me. Why, I'll teach him a lesson! Let the deed be done! I'm going downhill for just a bit. I'll be right back! You don't need to be worried! Alright? Come now! I'll be back before you know it. Good day, lassie! What brings you about? Good be thy heart! 'Tis where the road led me! You know how it is... Need takes you where you need not be. And what need would that be, my dear? Well... I don't know who it was that stopped by my house in my absence, but I know he did me wrong! How so? He found the boys by themselves... He killed and butchered them and left me mourning... No! You don't say... From now on, what I say or don't say doesn't change a thing. Deed is done. My poor babies are with God now. That's why I'm preparing a small feast as an offering to honor them and the Holy Trinity. And I figured I'd welcome you too. Happily, of course! Happily! But I would've been happier if you had invited me to a wedding instead! I believe that, I do! But things are never as we want them to be... They are as God intends them to be... Open up, sweetheart, it's me! Come, help me set the table outside! There you have it! A feast offering I've managed to scrape together. And I figured I should invite you too, to help ease the pain. Dear God Almighty! The things we hold dearest are precisely the things we don't get to keep. Yes, well... Man can only avoid... what he can foretell. Have a seat... and feast on what God has granted us! Strange, really... how we keep ending up... alone. Well... You know how people are... I sent out word and Godspeed. But the day is still young. You enjoy your meal. May God rest their souls! You've surely outdone yourself! May they rest in peace. May they. And may the fires and brimstone of hell scorch the soul of he who took them from their mother! Their mother! Good God, oh, gracious... there's no greater sorrow than that of a widow! Don't let... your heart sink! Eventually... we all end up there. All of us! Yes, of course... But their tender souls went way before their time. Seems like God too prefers them tender! But this wasn't God's doing. Was it? What are you doing? Let go! Let go! Unhand me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Mama! Unhand me! What are you doing? Let go! Let me go! Mama! Come, bring it here! Bless your heart! Well, looky here... Where have you been hiding, laddie, that I haven't laid eyes on you yet? Come! Come here and give your godfather a kiss! Let... let your godfather finish his food before it gets cold! Come! Come sit down and eat! That's alright, the food is too hot anyways! Let it cool down a bit! Meanwhile, the two of us can talk, man to man. What's...? Time you spew everything you swallowed! Get me out! My heart is burning inside of me, get me out! As mine did when you took my babies from me! "God likes them tender," was it? - That's alright! - It burns! That's alright, I don't mind mine being a bit older! - As long as they're well-cooked! - It burns! Just like that! Just like that! Have the fire burn them through! Don't leave me! - I'm dying! - Burn, my friend, die! You're of no good use alive anyways! Do you remember, you filthy swine, when you promised you'd never harm my babies? I'm burning! I'm dying! I'm dying! A death for a death, friend! One burn for another! SCREEN ADAPTATION OF THE FAIRY TALE THE GOAT WITH THREE KIDS BY ION CREANGĂ FOR OUR GRANDPARENTS
