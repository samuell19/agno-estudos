Sandra! Go go! Sandra! I'm a friend of Mrs. Garcet. I want to say hello Hey! Didn't you hear me? Take me to Mrs Garcet. She's not here. But I just saw her arrive Listen, I'm her friend... Oscar Mino I've been overseas... I just returned Please tell her I'm here. If she's not here... how can I tell her you're here? Look! There she is! You can't tell me it isn't her! There's only one Madam here... Contessa Claudia Odya D'Blanc And she doesn't see anyone. This is alright. - Are you sure?- Tell them to bring up my bags - Okay- I confess... this is the grand life! Come on. Come on. You'll see. It's just marvelous. Nice terrace, eh?... And if you want some sun... there are the chairs. The park belongs to Odya D'Blanc ...and you should see her house It's one of the oldest mansions in the city It's a quite family. You never see or hear anything from them. You're doing it all wrong What am I doing wrong? Are you talking to me? E fin tropical Vicente, sa? Always closed up in that house, looking after the garden... It's obvious she's studying for a course... Look, it doesn't bother me at all. Actually, I'm happy for them. People like Blanc should be robbed... Because so much wealth just isn't right... It takes away your desire to work, to make an effort. Sandra! Sandra! Sandrina! Miss, you're mother is about to leave. She wants to see you. What is it Martin? - Someone is over there- Ricky, pray to your father. Look Over here, look. Don't be silly. - Stop it- Talk. Say something. What do you want me to say? Cha Cha Cha What are you doing, Fabrizio? Can't you see he's crying? Good Ricky. Good Ricky. Come on, Fabrizio, He fell asleep. -Be quite- Don't you dare touch me. Okay, princess. As you wish. Can I take some sun. Or should I be confined to the bedroom? Stop it, Fabrizio. Ricky! Come here. Quickly. Give me your hand... Come on! Oh Ricky--- how you scared your mother! Can you explain your stupidity? Don't scream at him. He didn't do it on purpose. He certainly did it on purpose!... You baby him to much, you're always kissing and fondling And if he's not around... it's a crisis! Please, let's talk later. We aren't talking at all!... I'm going to the city. I'll see you tomorrow. How wonderful! He's leaving! But Ricky! I'm happiest when he's not here. What are you doing hear? What do you want? I don't know... I came to say hi to Sandra. But everything is so strange. I'm Oscar Mino, an old friend of Sandra and Fabrizio. Oh yes. I remember... And you left to go overseas, Right? I just returned a few days ago. And I heard about Fabrizio How did it happen. Was he sick? An accident. He was cleaning a gun and it went off Ricky pray! And how is Sandra? I'd like to see her, maybe--- Sandra is about to leave on a trip. She can't see anybody I'll tell her you said hello. Goodbye... Let's go Ricky. Hey! Come here! Come down! Careful. Sandra! Sandra! Wait a minute! I knew you wanted to talk... that's why I called to you I saw you. What's your name? Sandra! It's me, Oscar. Don't you recognise me? Of course I recognise you. You yelled at me in the car. No! From before!... Excuse me... Sandra! You couldn't have forgotten me I know a lot of years have passed But we used to see each other all the time You really don't remember me? Ha! This is great!... I return after all these years. My first thought is about you I try to see you and they wont let me And now--- I guess it's a mystical conspiracy I saw your mother and your son this morning. What? What are you saying? I don't have a son. He's not your son? Excuse me. How could I have a son if I'm not married? Huh? You know in good families, girls don't have babies illegitimately My mother tells me I'll have those things later But for now--- she doesn't want anybody to see me I'm always here alone. Alone. These are my designs Do you like them?... Aren't they beautiful?... No. These are old. From a long time ago. Oh Sandra. Oh little Sandra If you accepted my love this wouldn't have happened Fabrizio couldn't--- Yes, everything would've been different Listen, Promise you won't go away. Don't leave me alone. Certainly. I'll come back. Swear it. It's something incredible. She's a beautiful girl... She seemed normal How is it possible she doesn't remember anything or anyone? I never saw them from the time they moved to the lake I didn't see them until I heard about the accident I never thought Sandra would be so impressionable. She seems like a different person. Not the same at all And not a nurse anywhere. Why?... Only a guard. They probably gave her some special treatment. They're rich. But who? What did they do? And why did she get sick? Is there any hope of her getting well again? What business is it of yours? Your not her parent... You're nothing to Sandra. I'm closer than a parent When I left, she was happily married... but now she's alone And now I feel the responsibility to take care of her It can't hurt. There's a family doctor... Dr. Vinkle. I'll check with him. On your card it said: Dr. Vinkle. Actually it said 'On behalf on Dr Vinkle.' He's a medical associate I'm Dr Buontempi The Dr asked me to check on some of his patients Your daughter Sandra is one of them. Dr Vinkle isn't a specialist. We have one now. Excuse me... Who? Dr Nistri. Strange. Nistri is a Doctor of great reputation I never thought he would handle a case through correspondence Madam, for months he's been teaching in America at Princeton I don't need to explain myself to you The health of my daughter is my only concern I know what to do for her I assure you. Sandra is fine. She doesn't need anything. She would be normal if she were ten years old... But she's-----? Who is it? Emilio? Is that you? Did you find out anything? Yes, yes. I found out something ...unfortunately I did. Come on. Talk I know you called when I was out----- What time is it? I don't know. Tell me... Did you see Sandra? What? Tomorrow the mother and daughter are going to the clinic I convinced the lady to let me examine Sandra. Tell me... then---? Then... that's enough. I'm getting back to sleep. The doctor is making his rounds He said the patient you're waiting for isn't here yet. They should have been here hours ago You talk please. Just ask if the contessa is still at home. - Hello?- - Yes?- Please can you tell me if the lady is at home? No the Contessa has gone. - What did you say?- She's left. - Left?- Ask him where? Excuse me, can you tell me where? EXCUSE me H moment. Hello. Excuse me who is this? I'm a nurse from St. Teresa hospital. -Oh, St. Teresa- Yes . -Why?- It's about little Ricky. It's important. The Contessa has gone to her country home. Thank you. Good day. Excuse me, Emilio. They took her away I think I know where they went. Come with me. I don't know if I have the right to get involved in this mess. Of course you do. You're a doctor You know any sickness can be cured only through treatment You have every right to demand an explanation Don't you think it's strange they took her away... Instead of coming here? I think something is wrong. Amazing! Is that yours? -Yeah .- What did you do? Kill a sheriff? What do you mean? Don't you remember? I had a rich uncle... And I was his favourite. But you made a fortune in Venezuela. I worked like a dog for years in Venezuela. When you were chasing Sandra People thought you were doing it for the money But they can't say that anymore. This time no one is going to take her away from me Hopefully, we wont be to late. Excuse me. I hope you don't mind if I drive fast This car suffers when it goes too slow At 100 I start living. You found fortune but you didn't find happiness. That's why I came back. I never heard of this property of the D'Blanca's family. You probably don't know how much they really have Think about it. One time, Sandra said she wanted to marry me ...so she could live in a small 2 bedroom apartment. But instead she married the rich Fabrizio Garcet Listen to me, Oscar Z rooms are a dream for the person who has only one. How dare you come here!... I'm warning you! I'm sick of being spied upon If this continues, I'll find a way to end this persecution Call the police if you want... But first, I want to hear your reasoning You have a responsibility to your sick daughter! Why did you bring her here instead of the clinic? Dr Buontempi convinced me that Sandra needed treatment So I followed his advice But I have the right to decide WHO should treat my daughter. Where is she now? In Switzerland, a special clinic ...away from bothersome people. And you Dr Buontempi, don't you think------? Sandra! Oscar! Oscar! No! Please, miss. Please. No! I wont be locked up in this room! Let me go!... Oscar! Sandra! Sandra! Sandra my little girl--- what have you done? You hate me! -No- Yes, you hate me!... You wanted to send my friend away because you know I love him No! No! He can stay here all day... I invited him to stay here ...tell her your staying. Huh? Of course I'll stay Sandra I'll stay all day. My hair is such a mess. Who ruined my dress?... Go away. I must change my clothes... I have so much to do. This never happened before. This is the first time. I swear. It's going to happen again and again Always more frequently Your daughter needs treatment now... quickly Too much time has been lost. But my daughter--- I know what's wrong with her She can't face her memories. Ma'am, you can't really think her state of mind is good Certainly she's managed to block out fabrizio's death But she's also erased her sense of maternity She must be cured for her son. For the boy's sake. Yes, for him. Her son--- what does she know about him?... She can't imagine. Now I've seen it all! Your mother will be so upset... You know that doll was a gift from your father. Sandra? Are you there? Come. Come, mom. I'm ready. Fabrizio called. He's going to see his lawyer... And he wanted me to go along. I said no I know what he wants to tell me. You don't want to reconsider? Reconsider? Reconsider the lawyer? Pardon me... But why should I care about dinner with Fabrizio's lawyer? But you can't hide. You must become social someday Listen, Sandra. Do you know what Fabrizio said this morning? Mom, stop talking about Fabrizio... You always go on about what he said... And then I'm supposed to respond ...Really!... His mistresses are the only ones who care about what he says Excuse me, Mother. I didn't mean to say that I'm so upset. Forgive me I'm so tired. Understand? I can't take it anymore And now Ricky is involved He has gotten out of control I can't leave him alone He's becoming aggressive. Sometimes he seems full of hate Understand? Know what I mean? The truth is... your just a little girl A selfish girl who wants to pretend none of this is real You'd be happy to sleep with your dolls... ...instead of your husband. Isn't that true? No. Do you know just how naive you are, mother?... Fabrizio... when I'm in bed... puts these dolls around me He says they turn him on... An erotic stimulus... Hey! There's one missing. Your son took it. He's acting a bit strange... I saw him with it in the garden. Why did you take my doll. Huh? Give it to me. Right now. It's not true. I took nothing! Stop lying. Ricky, you pinned it on a tree with an arrow I took nothing. I don't know what you're talking about. Well? What's new? Your son is a liar. It's not true. Not true. I swear. Here's what it's about Fabrizio I don't care about details I believe him In fact I congratulate him on his good sense in attitude The only way to live with females is to lie From the start Ricky's only mistake is he gets found out. Ricky! What am I going to do with you? Just imagine!... Fabrizio always wanted me to visit... What? I can't offer? No, Sandra told me to invite you people. Do you have cigarettes? - Sandra?- Did you leave them behind? - Fabrizio?- Sandra! Sandra! Fabrizio? Sandra! - What is it?- You told me to invite the lawyer Simonne... and his wife. Oh no! For God's sake. Please. Please. Send them away Immediately! Please! Quickly! Make them leave I locked Ricky in his room. Please send them away. Good evening, Sandra. Please excuse us for being a bit late I bet this villa is beautiful. Please, excuse us. Ricky isn't feeling well I didn't have time------ What's wrong? - For dinner- It's impossible. Not for dinner tonight. That's okay. Just give us some wine. We can talk. Everything was so unorganized. He was sick... And now he's in his room... and--- and--- Did you call a doctor? Does he have a fever? No! How did you do it? How did you get out? It wasn't closed. It---- Go! Go to your room! Mom. Mom. Behind there is a dead person. What are you saying Sandra? What? Ricky did it. He killed somebody! Ricky? A Vagabond. A bum was hiding in the cabana where Sandra sunbaths Ricky shot him with the bow and arrow It went right through his neck Maybe it was an accident... maybe he didn't know Ricky! It's not possible... And he's so attached to his mother. No! He hates me He only follows me to spy on me. Torment me He's ripped my clothes to pieces. Burns my pictures And when I yelled at him for destroying my doll... ...he poisoned the dog. I just don't know what to do anymore Understand? Sandra is becoming more afraid I sent the servants away because of the crisis Even Caterina. We didn't want any witnesses. You did the right thing. It's my fault. My fault. I never had the courage to face reality A normal kid Sandra didn't want him to stray to far from home She watched him carefully She was scared. He never talked to her Yes. Yes. I screwed everything up I let him get worse and worse. Ricky killed a man! No. These? You can't have these. You can have one later. I dumped the body here in the gully I almost lost my head when I heard you and Simonne arriving Should we inform the police?... It will be worse now... they'll find the body Ricky is just a sick boy He needs a doctor not the police I can't hand him over to the police It would be better if I say I killed him... I could say he was a crook and--- You're not doing anything like that! I don't want a scandal And I don't think we need to worry about a Vagabond We should just turn this waterhole into a tomb. It's risky. What about the law? The law? I've always obeyed the law But we can't allow ourselves to be compromised by it Please, Ricky needs our help Let me take care of it I know what to do. You're an extraordinary woman Claudia The most extraordinary woman I've ever known. Mother. I don't want to see Ricky... Please. Send him away. Calm down dear. We're dealing with everything Nearby there's a school run by nuns. They take care of---- Difficult children I know mother superior I'll tell her you're sick and we need help with the child She wont ask many questions. Claudia, It's better if you take Ricky soon. I'm going to the city for Dr Vinckle Get well as soon as you can. Ricky! Ricky... come. Move! We must go. Come on. Move! Come on. Let's go. I'm going dear. Try to relax... Don't get out of bed. Your mother will be back soon And I'll try to be quick... ...It's over. And I'll try to be quick... ...It's over. You stay there. May I help you? I am Madam D'Blanc. I have an appointment with Mother Superior Oh yes. Did you bring the child? Yes. He's in the car. - Good- Please. Can you give me a ride. Please? -Get in- Excuse me, ma'am. No one is answering. Impossible. My daughter is in bed. How could nobody answer? I could redial. No, forget it. Dial this other number. Office of Dr Vinkle. This is Ms. Odya D'Blanc... Mr Garcet had an appointment with Dr Vinkle. Is he there? - Hello?- Is that you Fabrizio? - Yes- Ricky has escaped... And nobody answers at the house ...What should we do? - Continue searching- I'm heading home. Gustavo, have you seen my nephew come by? No, Contessa. Not today. Sandra? Ricky? Sandra? Mother! Mom! Mother! I didn't want to. What would you have done? Everything's ready. Are you coming to the table? Darling?... Well, if you want. Let's go to the table. I'm sorry. But I must go back to the city. Excuse me. Didn't you say----? I wasn't planning to be away so long. I have an appointment. Mother? And you, Mr Mino? Will you stay for lunch?... Doctor, my chauffeur will take you to town. This is for Moreno. - Who is Moreno?- He's my friend. Come with me. You could meet him too. Wait. Why don't you have your cocktail first? You're right. In a certain sense... She seems so calm. Just like a little girl. A couple of years ago, Sandra liked me a lot She was almost totally in love with me Then one day I introduced Fabrizio to her I wasn't part of your circle... I was very poor But for me, the way she is now reminds me of then I just wanted you to know this ...before I go any further. Hey, Morena! I brought you a gift. Go. No. Not you. He's jealous, you know. How beautiful you are. Aren't you in love with me? A long time ago I was in love A girl like you She had hair like yours... eyes like yours... Even the same skin. Her name was Sandra, too. Did you marry this girl? no No? So then you can marry me! I think I'd like being married. Look at what I did today--- But I don't like them! I don't like them at all! Do you like it? Eh Of course... but try to get along. Excuse me, reverend Mother... I just talked to Contessa D'Blanc by phone... No doctor has authorization to see Ricky What should I do? Please. Please. I'll talk to the Contessa today... And tell Dr Buontempi he has my permission It's about time someone came to visit that boy. Thank you, Mother. Here... ...Here it's easy. Can I play with it? Certainly, it's yours. Okay, let him have it first... because he didn't ask for it. What's your name? - Ricardo Garnet- OK... Let's see. MMMmmmmm... Do you prefer this one or this? I don't want anything. - What?- You don't like toys? - Yes. But I don't want them- Did the nuns punish you? No. Not the nuns. But from the beginning--- I'm so bad, I must always be punished in here. I don't care about what happened in the past I only met you today... Would you except a gift for being good today? Do you like it? Do you want it? Hey! Emilio! What a day!... I was about to call and thank you If it weren't for you, I would've never convinced Claudia You'll see... I won't bother you anymore... No more! It's fantastic! Sandra loves me! I swear!... She loves me. It's not finished Oscar There's something new... Something very complicated I went to the school and talked to Ricky. You did what? The kid is normal. He's a complex character Timid. And aggressive... With a strong sense of justice that torments him. I told you to help me not get involved with that! You're wrong. You didn't ask me to help just you... You wanted me to help Sandra And I'm following my professional instincts Every time I try to understand a neurotic patient I try to get into the brain of the patient To see who the responsible person really is A gesture. An emotion. The mother. The father And the patient himself... This time the investigation goes beyond the brain Because in Sandra's sickness there is murder... Actually two murders ...and Ricky didn't do it. Then who did? There are so many questions... So few answers. Where are you going? To look for other answers... right ones. Even if they are the most dangerous. I don't know what you're going to find here The villa was closed after Fabrizio's death And we're here at night like two thieves But it's strange how much Claudia confided in us. Look at this. What do you think? Could a kid with a bow-and-arrow shoot through this?... Something isn't making sense in Claudia's story If we could verify the situation that sent Ricky to the school... We'd be closer to understanding the solution. If the child was accused wrongly ...why didn't he complain?... How do you explain that Children can be very weak in this world of grown-ups Everybody knew Ricky told lies So, who would believe him when he said anything? What do you mean? You know... If it's true that he killed a Vagabond... ...and Ricky was locked in his room by a key He could have only gotten out through the window But someone must have seen him There was the lawyer Simonne and his wife... No. Even in this story... Someone is lying Do you realise---- - Yes. Yes. Fine.- Amazing Ha! I ask for help from a doctor... And he turns into a police detective!... When I need a spy I'll go to the ambulance squad. OK, Oscar... I---- No! Come on. Say some more! But say it clearly! I think the crime of the child-- was done by an adult ...with a distorted mental state of a child And that's Sandra. What! You really think Sandra--- What about the shock AFTER her husbands death?... It didn't happen before. BEFORE... she was fine! That's your story! Do you know what Dr Vinkle thinks?... Yes, I went to see him... And he confirmed Fabrizio went to see him that morning... But NOT to talk about the condition of his son... ...but rather the condition of his wife, Sandra. Why didn't you tell me this immediately? Huh?... What do you want to do? What are you saying? I'll put everything in the hands of the police. I won't let you do this... Emillio! Did you hear me? You won't do this!... I'm sure Sandra is innocent. I'm sure of it!... I don't want her to suffer! I'll do anything to protect her Be careful, Emillio. You don't know me very well. I'm sorry, Emillio. It's true your right, Oscar I'm not a cop. But with two bodies... we need the cops. Wait. Where are you going? Let's talk. Wait... Emillio. Let's talk. Wait. Please... Emillio. Look. The two statues. Remember?... The place the Contessa was talking about Maybe we could figure this out if we saw the body. Stop, Oscar! I'm sorry for what is happening... But it's out of our hands now. The drain must be here someplace Ms Claudia said the body was dumped here I want to see the wound--- After so many months you won't see much. Then, we'll call the police. You're such a hardhead... Here. Here's the light. Give me a stick. What is this? Emillio! Emillio, come on down! Yeah. Emillio! look at this! It's heavy Without an autopsy... Is this the Vagabond? The child can't stay with his mother She's good for him... but it's dangerous If you give him a toy, he'll play with it Give him paper and he'll write A gun and he'll shoot When someone kills a man I remain indifferent But when a child is hurt, I am ready to fight. I agree with you But I'm afraid of what will happen to Sandra... ...if we call the police The interrogation, the analysis, her state of mind ...on top of everything she's been through And what if she's not guilty?... What if the truth is something else?... I'd never forgive myself for being so cruel to her Would you be able to forgive yourself?... Listen. Why don't we give it a few days before deciding Let's try to clear up the dark questions There are so many... The supposed dead man in the gully, What was that about?... And we should find out if Fabrizio was cleaning a gun... My opinion... a crazy person doesn't think of consequences She wouldn't concoct such a plan Come on, let's get some coffee. I have to make a phone call. Two coffees - Okay- Contessa Odya D'Blanc, please No. No, that's OK, just tell her Oscar Mino called... And I'll return the call around 10 or 10.30. Good. Thank you. So you are friends of Contessa D'Blanc? Yes. We are. What a tragedy! It happened here right on the lake To tell the truth, it felt like something wasn't going right Letting all the servants go... even the personal maid Then they wouldn't see any visitors They were always alone And I think--- if Fabrizio won't by himself--- But he wasn't alone. His wife was there. No. No. Mrs Sandra wasn't in the house... she was here I saw her myself. - Excuse me------ Are you sure about this? Listen, this is Milano... Fabrizio's death is big news Of course I'm sure of the facts The lady came right through there... I even remember what she wore... a brown outfit Somebody had called her house and... ...said her son had an accident in front of this place But that wasn't true, there was no accident But Sandra was so upset! So what could've happened? There are too many pieces of truth scattered around... We must pick them up and put them together. The problem is where do we start? Any ideas? Mmmm. You know... Fabrizio was a strange character The man... fascinating, happy, nice. Everybody liked him We were very good friends I was very poor And sometimes he would treat me like a servant... Then he wasn't so fascinating... nor very nice. Nor happy. Yeah. That's true. Fabrizio wasn't the type to be married. You mean... sometimes he would sleep with you, right...? Not just 'sometime'... it was often actually But how could I say no to him?... I was the maid... working for him He took advantage of my position ...He was easy with it But I never felt comfortable with the situation When I realised this, I stopped leaving the door open... And I found a real boyfriend!... But Ms Claudia wasn't consoled so easily!... What? You don't know?... She was in love with him?... It's the same old story Women becomes weak. .. untrustworthy Who knows? How do you explain all the servants being fired?... Probably so he could be alone with Bianca Monteni, right? Ah--- you mean Bianca Monteni. They were friends? Do you know her? Regardless... He replaced me with a male servant. What? I thought there weren't any servants in the house? How do you know this? Hey! I have no reason to lie!... All I'm saying is: I left so quickly I forgot to give them my keys So I went back. I heard him talking to someone ...with his anti-social tone, reserved for servants. And what was he saying? I was in a rush. Not paying attention. But... I heard him saying something about two statues in the garden Then he lowered his voice... I don't know. Dear Dr Buontempi. - Good evening madam- So you're here! How are you? Ahhh--- and you? Lately, not so good You know I was almost assaulted by a doctor. Some doctors have no resistance with a client like you--- Stop it! Quit the compliments. Have something to eat. Let's look together. ...Please. I was thinking about you recently... ...probably because I'm treating your good friend Mrs Sandra Garcet. Friend? Who said she was my friend? You're very wrong I was friends with her husband His lover, actually In fact, we were going to marry before the end of the year But a bullet changed those plans Do you want some advice?... Don't waste much energy on this new client She doesn't need to recover in a clinic--- rather in jail Do you want to hear a story? - Yes- There's a wife. We'll call her Sandra One day she finds she's losing her husband... named Fabrizio It seems he found another woman ...someone better for him A certain Bianca. And he decides to marry her Then Fabrizio introduces Sandra to his lawyer, Simonne He handles all his business Now Sandra decides to do some strange stunts to look crazy She shoots her husband and then--- She begins her greatest role--- her loss of memory In a little while she'll be cured Nobody will have the courage to challenge her. End of story Do you like it? You're not laughing doctor It's all bullshit. But on the other hand, who knows... I'll never be able to prove it. Just memories of Fabrizio. Yes, it's true. Fabrizio was Bianca's lover for a while And it's true he told her he wanted to marry her One time he brought her to me. And then called later and said it was all a joke... ...not to proceed with divorce papers There was no need for him to tell me I knew he would never leave Sandra He would never leave Sandra's money. You see doctor, I've been his lawyer for many years And I know about all his dealings The truth is Fabrizio had nothing He couldn't even buy roses for his mistresses... ...if it weren't for his wife's bank account It was Sandra who wanted to leave him She discovered many things about her husband She wanted a divorce. Everything is clear then Fabrizio was about to lose his wealth and the good life He new he did some bad things and couldn't change her mind When Ricky lied about the doll And Sandra appeared so vulnerable Fabrizio got the idea to use his son to snap her sanity He was the one who ripped her clothes, burned her pictures He poisoned the dog and set up the fake murder That's why we didn't find the body. There wasn't any!... He was trying to drive her crazy--- in front of witnesses You and Simonne Everything went perfectly Poor Ricky couldn't defend himself You swallowed the story of the crime and accepted a sick daughter You were ready to cover up everything for the D'Blanc name When you called Fabrizio at Dr Vinkle's office And told him Ricky escaped and Sandra didn't answer He decided to act out his plan of eliminating Sandra He wanted it to look like a desperate suicide attempt He went to the house and got his gun But at that moment. Ricky opened the door and surprised him In his hurry to hide the gun, it discharged In a certain sense, it was an accident. Excuse me ma'am. Everything lawyer Simonne said is true I discovered Fabrizio's death He had nothing in his wallet... nothing Through all the years, I wondered about their marriage Fabrizio had power of signature on Sandra's account He used and abused that privilege Take a look: $10,000. The last cheque he signed. Look good. May I have this? - Certainly if you want- Listen to me, Ma'am... Sandra's in a phase produced by a crisis Fortunately, we find ourselves, from a clinical point of view... ...with the knowledge of what caused her terrible mental state So if we could reconstruct that moment---- Yes. Yes, doctor. I want Sandra to realise Ricky's innocence ...as soon as possible. Close your eyes and count to 10 You know, I made some more designs Swear you won't peek. - I swear- You did these?! You said to draw whatever comes to my mind. My thoughts--- And I think about you often... you and me. We should stop. Why? ...Why? Because I---- Because I love you tenderly. Compliments. You're stealing. Don't look at me like that Every child knows: inside every Dr Jekyll is a Mr Hyde. If that were only true But aren't you too human to be two different people?... You're too much a workaholic for such experiments You don't care about anything except Sandra's recovery You're not concerned about her love for me disappearing... ...when she gets better. All you care about is her recovery But I want you to know I love both Sandra's I'd love her even if she stayed like this forever I don't care about the truth. I'm not a doctor. You're wrong. I'm searching for the truth, morality of reality If I weren't looking for the truth, I wouldn't care about man I'm involved in this because I wanted to help you But now your reality is clouded by Ricky and Sandra Ricky should be brought back to his family Sandra has to come out of that state of infantilism She deserves the dignity of humanity To help me with this, I'm prepared to throw away... ...your spasmatic love for her. No. There is no Mr Hyde inside. But be careful... If you keep acting like this you'll attract him. Listen, I'm aggravating you let's go back to the car. Mother never lets me go out by myself Why did she let me come here with you? Relax. She'll be coming soon My car is fast. We got here first. No. Sandra. My love, why are you crying. I'm scared. I don't know why... but I'm scared. I'm scared too, Sandra. So afraid I'd give anything for it to be the way it was. I'm sick, aren't I. But what do I have to do?... Why doesn't someone tell me? Darling, It's nothing serious. You had a big shock You just don't remember anything about it You don't remember when or why. Come. I've been here before. At this villa. By the lake But when? Huh? When? Yes, my love. A long time ago. It's a horrible place. Horrible! Horrible! No, darling. But bad things happened here So bad... your mind refuses to remember Come here Sandra. Trust me. Nothing will happen I'm here with you. I won't let anybody hurt you I'll always be with you. This is a child's room. Certainly, a child who loves you very much Even if you think he's bad... capable of hating you It's your son, Sandra. Your son. Mine? My son?... Oh no... how is that possible. I don't remember. His name is Ricky. And he loves you It's important you know that. His name is Ricky? And he loves me?... His name is Ricky... And he loves me Ricky. His name is Ricky... And he loves me.... We'll take care of this. Put Ricky in his room. Stay here. I'll get Ms. Claudia. I'll take care of the child Women... dear Ricky... they have a delicate balance Here's an example; Your mother is very intelligent But she believes... for some strange reason... ...you really hate her. But I never--- I know. I'm just trying to explain how this happened She believes things... and now she is in shock And she's convinced you want to kill her She thought you tried to kill her She imagined seeing a dead man. A man killed by an arrow. The man in the garden! I saw him. He was dead. What are you saying? Are you sure. Of course! You don't believe me? Yes. I believe you... but if that corpse is real... We must start from the beginning ...from the beginning Listen... will you do something for me? -Yes- Tell me what you saw the morning of the accident Tell me everything When I realised grandma wanted to enrol me in school I ran away. I wanted to tell mom I wasn't lying I didn't touch her things. I never wanted to upset her ...even if she was mad at me. Ricky! Are you sure someone was behind the curtain? Who? You couldn't see clearly. But yes, there was someone. Then? When mom came in--- I looked but no one was there. Did you tell anyone about this? No. There was so much confusion. The doctor arrived... Grandma took me to school. Did the police question you? Grandma told me to tell everyone I was in school Even Mother Superior said the same thing. For my own good. It's best if you keep saying that. ...Now, listen There's something I need to know. Tell me... When your father gave you the gun and pointed to the curtain What do you think he was trying to tell you? Huh? He wanted me to shoot. And you?... If your mother hadn't come in... What would you have done? Come see Sandra for a moment. In an hour, when she awakes... give her another injection. Doctor, aren't you staying? I must go immediately. I need to get some medicine... Can I use your car? Sure. Or I can go. No. It's simpler if I go. I'll be back quickly. The keys are in the other room Emillio, be careful. It can be a dangerous car. I know. Yes, I better go and--- Come. Come on in. Be comfortable I checked everything like you asked But there's no doubt... just like I thought I remember the facts and the circumstances. See? I was so sure Grandma. May I have some water, please? Poor little fellow. How are you? Hungry? No. No, thank you. I'm fine. My little one. You suffered so much You suffered more than anyone What happened to you is so mean ...so unjust I'll never forgive myself for not understanding. Will mother love me again? Of course. Now when she gets better we'll explain it to her We'll tell her how brave you are And how much you love her. My son, my son. Damn!! Can I use your phone? Sure. Sure. Go ahead. Oh my God! Sandra, look at me. It's Oscar. Remember me? Oscar. Hello? Is it you, doctor? What? An accident? No! Ricky's hurt? No! I'm on my way! I don't feel well. I have a fever. I was in bed... I was told to get here quickly. An accident with my son... ...in front of your bar. God! It was a man's voice. Relax, ma'am. Nothing happened. Someone's playing a joke Stupid and mean. ...Do you want a drink? No, thank you. No. - Relax for a moment- No.1 have to go. If Sandra hasn't had her injection, give it to her now And relax. When are you coming back? As soon as possible. Stay close to her. Don't leave her. Hello? Hello? Miss--- do you hear me? Sandra, where are you going? You should stay in bed Ricky! Ricky! Killer! Killer!... You were the one! I saw you! I saw you!... Killer! Killer! How could I have trusted you. You were never anything... A servant! A servant! You! It was you! -No- Behind the curtain, it was you! Be quiet. Be quiet! Help! Killer! Let me go! No! No! Mother! Mother! - Let me go!- Be quiet Sandra, listen to me. Let me explain. Please... Don't scream. What's happening? Sandra! The killer was Fabrizio. He wanted to kill you But he was to weak. He hired me to do the job I was dying from hunger in Venezuela I admit I dealt with him. Yes I came back. He paid for my trip I pretended to be the Vagabond Then he wanted me to kill you That dirty bastard! Do you know how much you were worth?... $10,000! I only said 'yes' so I could help you I wanted him to think I was going to help So he wouldn't look for another killer I was the one who called you that morning... I tried to get you out of the house ...so I could save you. Sandra! Open up! Open up! When he came to the villa And he found me... instead of your dead body--- He insulted me. And I shot him in the neck I did it to save you I only wanted to save you. Tell me it's alright I only want to love you. Don't call me a killer I'm not a killer Ricky! No! He wanted to kill you. Right?... He's a killer! And you needed my help! Ricky! Ricky! - I love you very much- Ricky! Yes. Ricky! Ricky! Sandra recognised him. He attacked her and I got scared He was the one who killed Fabrizio... He didn't love Sandra. He only wanted her money Yes, he was a criminal. It's not so simple.
