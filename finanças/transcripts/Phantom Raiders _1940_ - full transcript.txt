Not bad .. but not perfect. Perfect. He's always talking perfect. Such a guy I never did see. If that ain't the best knife-thrower in Colon, show me better, Mr Taurez. Gladly. Looks like we each owe Al a thousand pesos, Gunboat. In that. Humiliating, that's what it is. Humiliating. Come on Gunboat, come on. Remember our less fortunate friends. Birds and animals. - Going out for a bit of air. You may leave when I tell you to. Sit down please. Gunboat, mix Mr Morris a drink. - Oh sure, Al. Birds and animals. Say Al, how can a bird spend a thousand pesos? When you have time Gunboat, sit down and figure it out. Hello? Speaking. Yes, Mr Ramsell. Of course you may talk. I've just spoken to the Matlock. About ten minutes ago. Yes, she was exactly 227 miles offshore at .. Miss Barnes, please. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was a private conversation. Hello. Hello Taurez. I think we should proceed with a little more caution. Llewellyn's London office may discover that there's no raider off the coast. If they should send someone down here to investigate, I would .. Yes Al. Draw up the papers for the insurance claim please. Mr Morris will present himself in the morning. Adi?s. Al, before you go. - Just moment, please. Gunboat. Oh yes, Al? I want you to take a walk around the block. What again? I took a walk last week. You do want to make me happy, don't you? Oh sure, Al. It's my one ambition in life. Then please. Okay, Al. Okay. Only when I meet somebody and they say: "Hiya Gunboat, where you going?". And I say I'm just walking around the block, they look at me like I'm barmy. It's humiliating I tell you. Humiliating. Well Steve. The SS Matlock is beyond the territorial limit. Outward bound with a cargo of bagged wheat. According to the manifest of the Morris Shipping Company. Al, listen to me. Do we have to do it this way? Ten thousand bags of sand. Worth less than a thousand bucks. An old crate of a ship ready for the boneyard. And it's going to pay us a half a million dollars in insurance. Can you think of a better way? - I'm thinking of the men on the ship. Quiet, quiet please. You're frightening my little friends. Don't worry little fellow. Is the Matlock going to disappear like the other two ships? That's right, Steve. This set will shortly send out high-frequency impulse. It's tuned in on those 3 radio receivers that we presented to the ship's crew. Through the "Al Taurez Seamen's Association"? Exactly .. In each receiver there is a powerful explosive. And when the high-frequency wave reaches a certain pitch .. The bombs go off and the ship's blown up with all aboard. Exactly. And we collect a half million. Not this time, Al. Scotland Yard, of course? - Right. And I'm going back with you, and you. And Ramsell. Well. I suppose it had to end sometime. I didn't want to do this, Steve. Al had me. A gambling debt. Please Mr Morris, no hysterics. Do you want me to call the Police, Steve? I can handle that detail myself. Drop your gun. I'll take that please. Wait outside. Just compose yourself, Steve. It will take a few seconds for the tube to warm up. When the arrow on this dial hits twenty .. [ Humming noise ] Don't worry, sonny. We're nearly 250 miles out now. If the radio was .. Poor devils. Well, Mr Donnigan. Knowing you and working with you has been a great pleasure. You may leave now. And Steve. You forgot your knife. Well, I walked around the block. Kiss. Did you ever see such a soft-hearted guy as Al? Llewellyn's of London, Colon branch. Just a minute, please. It's Sir Edward calling from London. - Oh, I'll take it. Thank you .. hello? Oh, hello Sir Edward. I received your cable. You may advise the Morris Shipping Company we will pay that claim in full. Well, Mr Morris is here now sir. I shall advise him. Have you been doing anything more about the sinkings, Ramsell? Well sir, there's not much I can do beyond .. Searching and sealing the ships before they leave the harbor. Yes, I'm quite sure it's not sabotage. Although the city is full of foreign spies. Very well, Ramsell. You may rely on us for anything we can do at this end. And keep us posted. Alright, goodbye. Ramsell insists that it is not sabotage. If it isn't sabotage, then what is it? A raider couldn't operate in that territory for so long a time .. Without at least being seen. Three ships in a fortnight. Not one survivor left alive. It's got to be sabotage. Hello? Yes. Oh, hello Inspector. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Scotland Yard. They've heard from Colon. Their man's been murdered. We must go after this some other way. Hello London. This is New York. Hello, yes London. Just one moment, I'll connect you. Yes, Sir Edward. I understand sir. Yes, sir. I'll locate him right away, sir. Goodbye. "Attention please." "If Nick Carter is in the house, will he report to the box-office at once." Pardon me. Hello .. who? Honey, is your name Nick Carter? No .. he isn't here. Take that you skunks. And that, and that. And that. I'm sorry sir, but it won't hurt you. It's only for little bugs. Mr Bartholomew? - Yes. I was expecting you. I know, you're the census taker and I have a bathtub. No Mr Bartholomew, I'm from Llewellyn's Of London. I've got to find Nick Carter. You've come to the right man. I'm Bartholomew the Bee man. Here .. have a sample. Yes, well .. we have an important case for him. Five thousand dollars. Sir, your troubles are over. I'm Nick Carter's partner. I didn't want the case. But you give me 5,000 good reasons to change my mind. I'm sorry, but my orders are to find Nick Carter. Listen, I am just as good a man as Nick Carter. Where is this case? Here, or in London? In Colon, Republic of Panama. Panama? Havana. Kingston. Panama. I'll have him there in four days. Signed, sealed and delivered. Fine. [ Spanish language ] Well, if I'm wrong, I'll apologize. Si si. Does that mean you're going to make Panama a happy memory for me? You're wasting it, brother. She's a cute kid but she can't speak English. Not any at all? Oh, she picked up a few words from the sailors. But she hasn't any idea what they mean. You no savvy English? No? Yes? Sure, my tell big boy. You're telling me how you've been, sir. You old man. Speak English fine, yes? I told you. Look. I like you .. and you like me. Now what are we going to do about it? Set them up in the other alley. Come again? I'll be back in a flash, with a flash. Dolores, if I had any sense at all, I'd quit right now. But you are so cute that I .. Well, I feel like reaching out and chinning myself on those eyelashes. Well, shut my mouth. Ha .. yeah. I know it's like talking to myself, but I can't help it. Here's to you, gorgeous. Venus certainly left you plenty and all in the right places. It ain't going to rain no more. And even if it pours the sun will still be shining for me. You will make this Isthmus of Panama something I can paste in my memory-book. I've got great plans for us starting tonight. Nick Carter? You are always popping up at the wrong time. You never miss. Speaking of time, Nick Carter, right now you have no time for women. Run away little girl. Skat .. skidoo. Pull in your ears, big boy. We're going through a tunnel. Send her away. We have business. [ Spanish language ] I guess it's just as well I don't understand you. [ Spanish language ] Yeah, I'm afraid he's looking for trouble. Nick Carter, I fly all the way from Los Angeles .. Wait. You don't have to get rough with him. Listen, I do the bouncing around here. - You do, eh? Hey, look here. I ought to throw you right in the canal. Butting in when I was getting started. So, you'd let me down for a woman, eh? - Oh, any time. Would you let me down for this? For what? Five thousand dollars? What's it for? - For us. A retainer from Llewellyn's Of London. A retainer. But what's the case? No, no, no. Skat. Skidoo. Why, what's the case? Did somebody kidnap congress? Come on. Spill it Beeswax, will you? What is it? That's the bloodhound spirit. Follow me. Well Mr Carter .. do you feel that you'd like to take over the case? Gentlemen, your offer is very flattering. And the view from that window is lovely. I like everything about the proposition except the bombs. [ Alarm clock ] No need to be alarmed gentlemen. Eleven-thirty. Feeding time for my bees. Proceed Nick. You were about to say you would accept the case. I was about to say I would not accept the case. You won't accept it? We thought from what you said you intended to take it. Well, I probably would except for one thing. It would bite into my vacation. Of course. I understand how you feel about that. One hates to spoil a vacation. Especially when one was going along as nicely as mine. Give that check to Mr Ramsell. Here you are, sir. Five thousand dollars is a lot of money. Let's beat it before I get that idea too. Well, goodbye sir. Have a pleasant holiday. It will be if she's still there. Adi?s gentlemen. "SS Archos calling." "SS Archos calling." "SS Archos calling." SS Archos reporting. Hello Colon. Just coming through the Gatun Lock. Notify the Port Authorities we'll dock by seven. "Very good, Mr Ramsell." Very good Miss Barnes. Hello baby. Can I talk? Yes, they're in conference. "Meet me when we've docked. I've got something important to tell you." Seven o'clock, pier 14. I'll be there. Have a good time in Honolulu? Well .. too busy thinking about you. Flatterer. The Morris Line lost another ship. The Matlock. "What happened? 'The Raider' get her?" That's what they say. Hold on a second. Don't let me interrupt. The conversation was just getting interesting. "Hey, who's that?" - I don't know. Signing off .. The information desk is outside. This is a private receiving room. But the ship-to-shore phone is not so private, is it. Confidential messages in person, Pier 14. Seven o'clock sharp. Boo! The Archos just reported all's well and on schedule. Fine. Thank you, Cora. The check please. I've decided to take the case gentlemen. The uh .. human angle interests me. Well .. that will be splendid, Mr Carter. And I usually begin by asking questions. I'll be glad to tell you anything you want to know. I'll get to you later. I'll start with Miss Barnes. Very well. Go ahead. - Tonight. At dinner. Would 7 o'clock be alright for you? I'm afraid not. Okay, Possita at six. Good day, gentlemen. Boo! Cora. You're not worried, are you? No, why should I be? - Naturally not. Only I think he's got a lot of nerve. Well? Why did he change his mind? - That's what I'd like to know. Hello. Let me speak to Al Taurez please. You're fools to take the ship out. She'll sink like the rest and take you with her. Three ships Morris has lost. He's hard luck I tell you. We got to work, ain't we. - Maybe he won't get this one. He's right. I won't go. We'll be okay. Al Taurez Seamen's Association. Good old Al. - A clue? Back in the States, Al Taurez was always a clue. Don't let that weasel landlubber scare you off your ship, men. Come on boys. Stow these things that are all set to brighten up your voyage. This Mr Taurez seems to be a man of generous nature. Ah, yes. Al will give his best friend a knife in the back any day. Come on Mack. Pile on the cargo. You'd better get somebody to help you carry that aboard. Hey you. Lend a hand here. Sir, I work with my brain. Then you must have been on relief a long time. Come on Beeswax, he's got your number. - I got it, Mack. Careful Lou, it's pretty heavy. Thanks Al. What time did The Toledo cast off? - About 12 o'clock. Hello, Cora. - Hello, Al. Run along, Mack. - Aye-aye, sir. Al, have you ever heard of a detective named Nick Carter? Then you know him? - Yes. I'd say we're old friends with conflicting points of view. I have dinner with him in a few minutes. - I'd be surprised if you weren't. It's not a social appointment. He wants to "question" me. He probably wants your telephone number. - It's about the ships that disappeared. Dear old Nick. You'll find him charming. I'm not in the market for charm and I do not like being blackjacked into a date. In fact, I'm going to give Mr Carter a stand-up. Oh, Cora. As a favor to me. Please join Nick for dinner. Why? Now look, have I ever asked you to .. - I'm sorry Al. I'll do it. That's the spirit. Thank you. - See you later. Hello? This is he. This is Ramsell. I've just spoken to The Toledo. She's now on the high seas. Thank you. Hello little fellow. Not so much fun sitting in that cage all the time, eh? Hello Al. Hello, Gunboat. Would you mind taking a walk around the block? Again? - Please. Alright. Only .. It's humiliating. I know I'm late but I .. - Are you? I hadn't noticed. There's nothing like starting out friends, is there. A couple of champagne cocktails, waiter. - Yes, sir. I hope I haven't spoiled your evening. - Not at all. You've been a great help. That's the Prince Charming in me. You said there'd be questions. I answer the first. I am busy tomorrow night. How about .. As far as you're concerned, I'm busy the rest of my life 24 hours a day. Just a minute while I shift gears. But you ordered two champagne cocktails. I never went for that champagne routine. Coffee please. Yes ma'am. This is a new approach. It's called the "strictly business" angle. Every ship leaving the canal zone is searched before it's cleared and sealed. The cargo records must be noted. Llewellyn's insures the cargoes against the bills of lading. Swell, but now wait a minute. Does anybody actually check those cargoes? They are checked when they arrive at their destination. If they arrive. Would you care for a little sugar? - No thank you. I don't suppose you're a spy? Oh, but I am. Everyone in Colon is a spy. Haven't you seen the signs in the movie theaters? No spies under 18 admitted. - Really? I think you're a pretty clever little girl. But not clever enough to fool the great Nick Carter. Where have I heard that death-like whisper before? Al Taurez. - Nick Carter, my charming friend. Al, you look different. - Perhaps you miss the handcuffs. Evening Miss Barnes. - Hello, Al. How do you like my place here? - Up to now it's been very delightful. Tell me Al, what became of the Cleaners Union you used to run in the old days? Well Nick, you know I am superstitious. When 13 G-men started looking for me on a Friday I figured that was bad luck. And I got out of town. What are you doing down here? - Oh, just a vacation. Good idea Nick. I think everyone ought to take a vacation. They live longer. John. Well, hello. Mr Carter - Mr Ramsell. See Nick, this is one happy family. Cora here is secretary to John's father. Oh, how do you do? Hello. Say John, when are you going to get that wedding settled for you and Cora? You'll have to wait until we get married, Al. Um .. Al, how about .. Taking me on a personally conducted tour of your establishment here? Sure, with pleasure. - Nice to have met you. And it's been a very .. - Save it. Al. Did you ever have one of those days when everything went all wrong? Same old Nick. I suppose that nut brought his keeper? He did. Al, tell me. Who's the fiend incarnate that Bartholomew has tracked to earth? Mr Yamamoto. President of the Asiatic Export Company. One of our most respected citizens. Old Beeswax is running true to form. Happy days are here again. Hello baby. Seeing you restores my faith in Panama. How's your old man, kid? I see you've already met our Dolores. - Oh, but definitely. [ Spanish language ] What's she doing? Calling me names? - That's right, but nice ones. What will you have? John, stop pouting, will you. Well, suppose he is a detective. But why do you have to take orders from him? I gave your dad a chance to say a word to get me out of it. But he didn't. Anyway, let's forget it. I'm dying to hear that important news. Well honey, I got my Masters papers. John, that's wonderful. Now don't get too enthusiastic. I haven't got a command yet. But you will. Confidentially, I stand a good chance. With that raider operating, a lot of skippers are quitting their ships. John, please don't take that run. Why not? Every trip pays a big bonus. And maybe "that" if the raider gets you. Please stay on the Pacific. And what? Spend long weeks away from you on long voyages? Not me. John, three ships have disappeared. Honey, let's not argue about it. Tonight is a night to celebrate. Hey, waiter. Speaking about pouting, what do you say? How about a little smile? Yes, sir? What will it be? I know. Your favorite drink. Order it up. Champagne. - Champagne? Yeah, you know. The kind that goes pop. Yeah, sure I know. Oh, Se?or Gunboat. Hello, pal. I've just been for a walk. Look. Very nice, no? Peachy. See you later. Up you go honeybunch. [ Spanish language ] Humiliating. Wine up everybody. This is my party. Hello Al. Good evening, young lady. Life begins at forty. Sometimes she almost makes sense. Order up, sir. Mr MacMillan, this is Mr Carter. How are you, sir? - How do you do Mr MacMillan. Where is my wondering boy tonight? He is right here honey. Make it snappy, laddie. Ooh. Wrong number kid. Hang up. This is not for you, my lassie. - What is this, bank-night Al? Come, let me show you the rest of my place. Now don't tell me a heavy spender is making you nervous. Come on. Nothing is getting between you and me tonight my little paprika. All right my hearties, come and get it. Well, this is just a breath of home-sweet-home, Al. Isn't it. Oh, uh boys .. I want you to meet my friend Nick Carter. Glad to meet you, boys. Say, you know I'm on a vacation. What's the idea of putting the finger on me? Oh, you're mistaken, Nick. But you're a liar, Al. And if I'm wrong? You'll apologize. I know. Where we go from here, kid? Maybe Al can answer that. Now look, Nick. The past is over and done with. Can't we two be friends? Sure, why not. You're a man after my own heart. With a knife. Al. I've just heard they've got another one of my ships. Not the Toledo? - Yes, Al. I tell you I can't .. - Control yourself. Excuse me, Nick. Come on. Come on. Hey. They sunk the Toledo. What about the crew? Tell her to wait here. That's what I say: there's no more good sailors for the sharks. All sailor laddies. Life's not fair to them. Dying like rats. You fool. Coming here. - I had to do it. Come on, get in. I can't go on. - Be quiet. Carter is suspicious. Until he's out of the way, we must be careful. As soon as this claim is paid .. You'll get me out of the way but you won't. I won't sign the waver. Stop talking like a child. Carter. You work fast, Al. I know nothing about this but .. It has my unqualified approval. Why do you hang around here? Al doesn't like that and you know it. I got business here like I told you. No matter what I do, it's okay with Al, see. Don't get excited. This guy ain't going to talk to nobody. Oh .. good evening. It seems to me I've seen you some place before. Sure, pal. Come on in. Thanks very much. Hmm. You'd better tell Al he's working too fast. This ain't got nothing to do with Al. It's a personal matter between I and you. Concerning my lady friend. - Your lady friend? Se?orita Dolores De Mendez. Oh, but why go on. You mean Dolores? Yeah. You got some nerve trying to cut in on me. I'm Gunboat Jacklin, ex-heavyweight champion of the Pacific Tuna Fleet. Really? Could I possibly get an autograph? Ah. Dust him off. - Now wait a minute. The former heavyweight champion of the Pacific Tuna Fleet .. And he can't do it himself. What's the Pacific Tuna Fleet coming to? So you want personal attention, eh? Okay, Gunboat. For my money you are still champ. Are you going to let my girl alone from now on? I'll stay away when she tells me to. Oh, this is too bad. Alright boys, go to town. That's quite enough. Stay where you are gentlemen. Now Gunboat, I'll take the message you got from that Oriental Committee. No tricks, mind you. Beeswax, you never miss. I'll give your love to Dolores. Now, we can talk. All has been discovered. The plot is known. What is it? - False clue, false clue. Swell. While I'm packing get that check in the mail and send it back to Ramsell. What's that? Then phone the airport and see how soon I can get a plane for Havana. You have a clue in Havana? And how. And she hasn't got a boyfriend. Then you're quitting, retreating, surrendering? Now you catch on. When I accepted that job today I thought it may at least prove interesting. But nobody competes with wedding bells and a boxing champion of the Tuna Fleet. But your duty? Is to a guy called Nick Carter who insists he is on a vacation. The enemy strikes. Come out with your hands up. Come out quick or I'll shoot. [ Spanish language ] Now Listen, darling, it was all a mistake. We thought .. [ Spanish language ] Silence. A confusion of tongues. She doesn't understand you and you don't understand her. But everybody understands this. Yes, we have no pineapples. Sure. She wants you to beat it. Scram. - Very good. I retire, but I do not retreat. I'll telephone the airport to reserve a seat on the first plane. Yeah, if it doesn't leave too soon. The first plane. Step on the gas kid, there ain't a cop in sight. Will you listen to me a minute. I am trying to get it through your head .. That you and I are alone in this room here together. [ Spanish language ] I don't know what those words mean, but I recognize that look in your eyes baby. [ Spanish language ] Wait a minute. It was for me. Are you alone? - Huh? Yeah, more or less. Cancel that reservation on the plane. - Instantly. Stick 'em up. Come on, get 'em up. Get 'em up! Get them up I said .. close that window. Come on, close that window quickly. Oh .. give me this blackjack. Well that would have parted my hair right down the center. Say, what's your beef against me? Who sent you here? So you won't talk, eh? A little rough stuff, huh? You got me all wrong. Get some Scotch and three glasses there, Beeswax. What is this? - Just a party. You don't think I'm peeved because you tried to kill me, do you? Forget it. I'm always glad to see an old friend. And uh .. Don't apologize because the hour happens to be a little bit late. If you'll just sit down there and make yourself comfortable. Come on, sit down. Give him his drink there, Beeswax. Poison booze, huh? Your health, sir. That's it. Bottoms up. What's your name? Julius Caesar. Oh, Julius Caesar eh? Well .. Eddie Anders. Eddie Anders? Then it's not Julius Caesar? No. Oh well. Eddie, old pal. Just call me Nick. Come on now. Call me Nick. Hello Nick. - Hello Eddie. Nice looking fellow, isn't he? - Verily he is. You know Eddie, I'm afraid they'll be wondering why you're not getting back. Are you going to tell me who sent you? Uhuh. Well, that's just too bad, but I'm afraid you've brought it on yourself. Alright, get up. Come on, get up quick. Put this right over here. I think that'll make you a much better target. Sit down, Edward. Come on, sit down. You know. You could have bought me for a dime when I switched on the light .. And saw my old pal Eddie Anders standing there. And to think that our friend sent you after me. But don't you worry, Eddie. We'll protect you. They're nothing but a bunch of cheap hoodlums that I drove out of the states. And as Nick says, we can do a lot more for you than they can. Of course we can. Uh Eddie, isn't it a little chilly there there in front of that open window? Huh? Pour him another drink there. - Yes. Let's have a drink all round. And we'll drink to Al Taurez. To Al Taurez. - Al's an old friend of mine. I knew him back in the old days when only had the one knife. Listen Nick, cut it out. Cut it out. I ain't got nothing against you. I ain't got nothing against nobody. But you still stick to that stuff you spilled on Al, didn't you? Close them windows, give me a chance. You'll get me killed. I'll do anything. Well, there it is. Al can throw a knife around a corner. Al Taurez? The kid himself. Getting a line on him that way was kind of tough on you, wasn't it Eddie? Come on. Get up here. - Wait a minute. Thanks for saving my life. - Don't mention it cut-throat. I just didn't feel in the mood for a Coroner's inquest. Scram. Give me a break Throw me the in the clink. Come on, beat it or I'll open these windows again. Alright, maybe I can make a run for it. - Get out that door. Go on. Well, Beeswax. Tomorrow .. We check on good old Al Taurez. Because I've got a sneaking feeling he's up to no good. We check. Mr Morris. Ramsell. When I told Captain Barrett of the Archos his ship was going to Liverpool. He refused to take her out tonight. At such short notice? - Let me have the Archos. John, please. Not on that one. What's the difference if our ship has a new skipper if she still sinks? Yes .. but, you've been transferred to the Madonia on the Sydney run. As first mate? Uh yes .. the Madonia has a Captain. The Archos hasn't. I've got my papers and yet you turn me down. Why? Son, I don't want you to take the Liverpool run. Ships have been lost. Ships have got through. Why not the Archos? It's a gamble and I don't want you to take it. It's also my chance to get a ship. Now come on, Dad. You know how hard it is to get your first ship. Perhaps when you return from Australia. - I'm not going to Australia. I'm taking out the Archos tonight or I'm going to quit tomorrow. John Ramsell, you listen to me. Honey, I know what you're saying. If I take the Archos the raider may get me. And the goblins may get you. Oh John, please be serious. - I am serious. Don't you see any ship with contraband is liable to be picked up by our raider? Why even the Madonia in the Pacific. Australia's at war too. - Yes, but the chances, John .. The chances are the same on any ocean if you happen to be caught by a raider. I've got a hunch or a feeling or whatever you want to call it that .. I could bring the Archos through. Then we would be sitting on top of the world. Llewellyn's pays a big bonus. Come on, honey. Get over in my corner will you. I need a good second. Alright, count me on your side. I always wind up there anyway. Now you're talking pal. Come on, they can't turn me down now. Well dad, it's two to two now. Cora's on my side. The matter is closed, John. You will not sail on the Archos. Report to the Captain of the Madonia immediately. And put in your resignation. That's final. Very well. You can accept my resignation now, can't you? Yes. With regret, John. - John, reconsider. Mr Morris doesn't want you to leave his line. He doesn't? Well, he certainly has a funny way of showing it. Good day. That settles everything as far as I'm concerned. The Archos will be the last. The Toledo was the last. Not one cent of that insurance money will Al Taurez collect. I'll not sign the indemnity claim. I'm through with sending men out to die. Tell Al Taurez that. You sent for me, Al? - Yes. Dr Grisson, you are about to enlarge the field of your activities. Tonight you are going to take over the Morris Shipping Company. Mr Morris is .. going to retire. Mr Morris? Wait out there please. Well .. good morning, Cora. I warn you Al, I've come to ask a favor. I know. You want John to have command of the Archos, don't you? That's right. Cora. Are you sure you want to bury yourself in a place like this as a seaman's wife? I love him, Al. Love is such an uncertain quantity. So many things can kill it. While, if you return to New York .. - I've made my choice. I see. John can have the Archos, for your sake. Al, you're a good friend. In this instance my dear, I'm being a very wise friend. There is one more thing. Don't tell anyone I asked your help. Not even John? - Not even John. I understand. - Thanks again. You go on back to the hotel and stand by. I've got some chasing to do. On business. You're a fast walker, aren't you. Did you follow me from the theater? - Well, I tell you I'm a little curious. Won't you sit down? What were you doing over visiting Al Taurez? Is there anything suspicious about calling on a friend? Oh, I see. A few months ago when you were stranded here Al helped you out, didn't he? He gave you a job in his place. What were you doing? Thanking him again today? I asked Al to see that John got command of the Archos. Uhuh .. but I thought Morris owned the Archos? Why not ask him? - John did. Mr Morris refused to consider it and John's father sided with him. Why? Because it was John's first ship, I guess. Owners are like that. But Al can fix it, eh? He said he could. But, sort of uh, on the quiet? Well, yes. Tell me .. who got you this job here? Yeah, I thought it was Al. - What of it? I didn't like working in the theater. - I see. Al has got drag enough to get you in here .. And drag enough to put John in command of the Archos. Well, that guy never did a good deed for anybody for the sheer joy of doing good. What's your pay-off? He asks nothing of me. Not even a little information concerning .. Insurance coverage on ships and cargoes? Now and then I .. Certain ships, huh? The ones that disappear. Are you trying to intimate .. - I'm not intimating anything. But I'm telling you you're letting yourself in for some trouble. Now, the next time Al Taurez wants any information, let him ask Ramsell. Mr Ramsell would never .. - Wouldn't he? How do you know he doesn't? How do you know that Al doesn't check your figures with Ramsell? Hey, you've got a lot of nerve. If I'm wrong I'll apologize. Emergency. Quick. Will you excuse me. It will be difficult, but if you must go .. I'm afraid I must. Adi?s. This note was waiting for you at the hotel. "Please meet me in my office at 7 o'clock." "Important. Franklin Morris." I wonder what Morris could want with me. - Mysterious. It's several hours until 7 o'clock. Oh, but so much to be done. - Yes, yes. Let's see. - Let's see. Where do we begin? - Ah, where? I've got it. - Yes, yes. Of course. Al Taurez. - We check. He called the hotel where Se?or Carter was staying but Se?or Carter was not in. So he told the clerk, when Se?or Carter comes in .. Tell him to meet me in my office at 7 o'clock. Thank you, Ysidro. You're a very observant secretary. I'm sure Mr Morris values your services very highly. I know I do. Thank you, Al. Oh .. Gunboat. Would you do me a favor? Oh listen, Al. - Now please. Just a short walk? - No. A nice long one. This is humiliating. Yes, sir, humiliating. Where's Dr Grisson? Two of the radios for the Archos are at the dock. I'm still working on the other one. There's no hurry. We won't put them aboard until Mr Carter has called on Mr Morris. And tell Mack to stand by at the shop. - Very well. See you later. Do you recognize him? - Last night at the warehouse. Right, now the old hat-trick. Got it all straight? To the dotted I. - Your nerve? Bartholomew courage never falters. Don't put it on too much. You look crazy enough as it is. Come on now, get rolling. Well, hello. I haven't had a personal introduction. I know you're a friend of Nick Carter's. Why'd you fail to kill Nick last night? - What are you talking about? I hate a bungler and as you bungled, I'm going to kill you. Look here, old man. If Nick .. - Nick knows all about it. I left him a note. I said I'm going down to kill that bungler. May I answer the telephone? Yes, yes. I love to hear people answer the phone. But I get mad if they say anything except "everything is alright". And they must laugh. Well? Quick. I want to hear that everything is alright. Hello? Hello, Al. This is Carter. Look, Bartholomew has gone mad again. He tried to cut my throat this morning. I hit him and locked him in a closet. He fled and left a note saying he would kill you. Get out of your office quick. Everything is alright. Ah, so he's there now? He wants you laugh? Well that means he's bad. Now listen to me, Al. There's nobody in the world I'd sooner see dead than you. But if Beeswax turns you into a human hairnet .. It will involve me and spoil my vacation. Are you listening? Everything is alright. - That's nice. You've got one chance if you can persuade him to take a walk. After a couple of miles he cools off and starts to cry. Then you're safe. But don't make a move before that, because he kills quicker than a cobra. If you understand what I mean, laugh three times. Yes. Everything is alright. Talk into the phone again and laugh. - Supposing we two go for a walk? No! More phone .. more laughter. Such a beautiful day out with flowers and birds and sunshine. And people. Yes, I can kill you and lots of people will see it. It will be pretty, yes. Yes. Quick, walk. Walk. Between the ribs, it burns there. It burns. But look, I .. - Quiet. Perhaps I'll think of another place. Right 1-4-7. Left 12-9-2. [ Humming noise] [ Humming noise, loud ] Get away from that. Outside. Quick! Look, don't you think .. - Yes, I think. I think this is the time and place. There, you see. Now you're beginning to feel sad, aren't you. Go away. Go away before I kill you. Run. Run. Nice work Beeswax. How does it feel, being crazy? I didn't notice any difference. Although that is to say .. Come on, get in here. - Where's your hat? I lost it back there. You'll have to pick out a new one. Vamoose, driver. Now that set in Al's office sends out an impulse. You see. And that impulse will explode any bombs that might be hidden in those ships. Then it is solved. We close in. Arrest Al. Yes, and tip off the others? Oh, fancy seeing you again. Get her while they're hot, kid. What have we got here? A clue? Perhaps, a trap? Uhuh .. Beeswax, confirm that for me. Maybe I don't see right. "I have broken my engagement with Se?or Gunboat Jacklin." "Because I have decided to marry you." Think your way out of that, Mr Carter. What about the poor sailors on a night like this? That's exactly what we're trying to find out. Sit down there. What a problem you turned out to be. - Hello kid, is my hat straight on? We'll go into that a little later on. Beeswax, take a letter from A to Z. Let me think. Well, let me help you. How about "R"? Ramsell? I've got an idea. Yes. Yes .. but who are you? Never mind who I am. I have got some inside information on that warehouse explosion this afternoon. Why should I be interested in that? You're in the insurance business, aren't you? My company didn't insure that building. Oh blimey, I must be talking to the wrong company. I'm sorry. We've rattled him a little bit. Now, if Ramsell is on this thing with Al. He's going to be in Al's office within ten minutes. So we've got to get things ready. Look, I tell you what I want you to .. Uh .. Let .. me .. speak. To .. Se?or Ramsell .. please. Now look. No, honey. But wait a minute. That's swell .. but now. Let .. me .. speak. To .. Se?or Ramsell .. please. Come on. Let .. Me .. speak .. to .. Se?or Ramsell. Please. Honey, you're marvellous. I'm going to give up this racket of mine and go in for languages. Hmm, baby. I tell you the high-frequency wave had to come from a sending-set in this room. It couldn't have. We are the only ones who knew the combination of that safe. Something went wrong with the set you worked on. - Impossible. If the bomb was set off from here .. Then why didn't the receivers in the garage blow up too? Because the percussion caps were not set. I never set them until the receivers are ready to go on the ship. The one in the laboratory was set because I had been working on it. I had to step out for a moment and .. - Please Doctor .. We have no time to argue. Can the other two sets take care of the Archos? Easily. Al. I just received a mysterious phone-call. A man offered to sell inside information to me on the explosion this afternoon. What is this? What the ..? - Don't get excited Doctor. Is that all he said? Yes. I refused to discuss the matter at length. I see. Instead of making an appointment with him and meeting him in some way. That's typical of you, Ramsell. Well, you got anything else to tell me? No, Al. But aren't you worried about this? Not at all. Mysterious phone calls don't worry me. Oh by the way, Doctor. I may have to be out of town for a day or two. So you'd better stay here tonight and handle the set. And this time. We won't wait for Mr Ramsell's report on the ship's position. What do mean, you won't wait for my report? You heard what I said. I don't need it. Send the impulse at midnight sharp. She'll be less than 75 miles out. So what? Who outside of you and myself will know where she disappeared? What are you getting at, Al? Oh, Dr Grisson is taking over he Morris Shipping Lines. Then Morris is out? - That's right. So are you. Oh .. you think you can get away with this without my help. Why not? So, you're taking over everything? - Right. Well, don't forget that I can talk. We'll close your mouth. [ Telephone ] Quiet please. Hello? Let .. me .. speak .. to .. Se?or .. Ramsell .. please. Who is this, please? Dolores? "Why should Dolores call you here?" - "I don't know anyone named Dolores." Do you mean young Mr Ramsell? Si. "He's not here." Gracias. Adi?s. Good work baby. Now look. We know Ramsell is tied in with Al on this thing. Let me speak to Se?or Ramsell please. We must be off. Mr Morris awaits us. Pardon the rain-check, baby. I'll throw him in a manhole when I get him out. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Everyone is gone. He is alone now. Better stay on watch here. - Yes, sir. Why the startled look? Did you expect somebody else? No .. of course not. I've got to go .. - I won't keep you long. Just sign this. So the so-called ownership of the company is about to pass to Dr Grisson? If you don't mind. Mind? I can't recall a happier moment. This transaction is dated a week ago. So that Dr Grisson can relieve you of the duty .. Of signing the indemnity claim for the Toledo. Alright. I'm the man. I'll not try and block it so long as I'm free. And here's a memo from the new owner for your information. Captain John Ramsell is hereby given command of the SS Archos. To take effect .. You can't do a thing like that. Since you are out of the company why let its affairs worry you? "Mr Morris?" - Yes. "Captain Ramsell to see you, sir." "Send Captain Ramsell in please." Yes, sir. I'll wait here. Don't forget to thank Mr Morris. Don't worry, I will. Mr Morris. Thanks for letting me have the Archos. - Don't thank me. Well, I know you changed your mind. - You can't have it. If it's the last thing I ever do, I'll see that you don't take that ship out. Why take that attitude? - Get out. I won't get out until you explain. - I have nothing to explain. I'm through talking. Get out of my office before I throw you out. Listen to me, John. Unless you leave I'll phone your father. I'll not go until you say what all this is about. I explain nothing. This memo gives the ship to me. - Give me that memo. Oh, no I won't. Hello, Miss Barnes. What happened here? Where did that knife come from? - I don't know. Where were you? - She was standing here. Don't touch it anybody. They want to get fingerprints off that. How about that door. Could it have come from over here? - I don't know. No, you couldn't open that door from the outside. Well, it looks to me as though you have some tall explaining to do. You are under arrest, and so is the .. Ah, she took that knife with her. You take over here, I'll go down see if I can get aboard the Archos. I'm in command of the Archos. Let me go and I'll take him aboard. If it's alright with you I'll be responsible for him. Si Se?or. I'll take care of things here and send out an alarm for the girl. Fine. Come on. Oh uh, if you pick up Beeswax, give him back the Indian. I'll take a look at the cargo. - Alright, this way. Read that to me again. "Dear Se?or Gunboat, Adi?s." "I give you the air." "I will marry Se?or Carter and .." That's enough. Humiliating. What's all this? - Wheat. Wheat, eh? Well, how would you like to have biscuits made out of that? Sand. Yeah. And over there are a lot of rotten hides. This is a neat little insurance racket. I'm not responsible for the cargo, mister. I take what's put on board. After it's been certified by Llewellyn's agent, eh? Are you insinuating that my father .. - I am. But if I'm wrong I'll apologize. The Port Inspectors are wanting the ship's papers, sir. Thanks. Is it alright if I go above? As long as you don't leave the boat. I've given you my word. What's the matter? Who hit him? Did you get the license number? Stow that gab and lend a hand. Inspector. Your clearance papers, Captain. Good luck. Thank you. Hello, Al. - Hello. John. You ran away to put suspicion on yourself. So you wouldn't lose your ship. But where did you go? - To Al. I knew he'd help me. Thanks, Al. Thank you for thinking of me and my ship. I guess I'll not take her out after all. - What's the idea? Carter's placed me under arrest. He's below now, going over the cargo. Got your clearance papers? - Yeah, right here. In that case, I wouldn't worry too much about Nick. I think I can persuade him to let you sail. You can? Of course. He and I are old friends and .. Why not let Cora make the voyage with you? By the time you come back, the Morris murder will be all cleared up. Oh Al, how can we ever thank you? Don't try to thank me. Alright children. Goodbye and good luck. Goodbye Al. - Adi?s. So long, Al. Stop or you are a dead man. Now look here my friend. - Silence! Remember. If you betray me you die. Hello, Al. - Hello. Say, what do you think? I just smacked down our Mr Carter and got him tied up below. Do you want to see him before he goes on a nice long ride? Yes, of course. - Come on. Alright Mack, open up. Al wants to kiss Mr Carter goodbye. Sure. Do you want to let him come in too? Well, I'll be a pink .. Hey, did you know curly was with you? Yes .. yes, he's always with me. Step inside, gentlemen. You too, sir. Sure, what have I got to lose. Your associate in crime detection begs to report the capture of 3 prisoners. Beeswax, you're a one-man riot. It's humiliating, that's what it is. Ain't it though. Come on, cut me loose here, Gunboat. Come on. Hello, Al. - Congratulations, Nick. You and your little playmate have a smooth routine. Well. Al, with .. an old smoothie like you, we've got to have one. And now, muscle-bound, I've got a little present for you. That's for that tap on the skull you gave me when I wasn't looking. Now you mount guard here at the door and keep your eyes peeled for boarders. Aye-aye, sir. And gentlemen, I'll take whatever deadly little knick-knacks you may be holding. Well Albert, where have I seen that knife before? Can't remember, eh? Huh? In Morris's office of course. A couple of hours ago. A little cleaner now than it was then, isn't it? Huh? Nice of Miss Barnes to give it to you. Oh .. what's this, dead-eye? Your mosquito gun? Yeah, humiliating isn't it. We'll get rid of those, boys. A ticklish smuggler, are you? - Aye. Now, you're a nice boy. Written home to mother lately? You keep our mothers out of this. Forgive me, Gunboat. Sit down boys, won't you. And make yourselves comfortable. We're going to take a nice little boat ride. Look here, Nick. You can't Shanghai me. Why Al, what talk? I'm merely inviting you on a nice, invigorating sea-voyage. With fireworks, maybe. Look here Grisson, don't be a fool. Al Taurez will turn against you. He'll treat you the same way he treated Morris. The way he treated me. Maybe he's gone already, leaving us holding the bag. Let's get out while .. Sit down Ramsell, you're acting like a jittery idiot. Well, I'm going to get out. - Shut up. You can go. After I blow up the Archos at 12 o'clock. What are we going to do? Stay in this hole all night? It depends on you, Gunboat. I don't know what you're talking about. Bombs? I never seen no bombs. What would I be doing with a bomb, anyway? You're either a very smart liar or really as dumb as you look. I don't know which. - Don't call me dumb. Steady. Or I'll draw a bead on you right between the eyes. Why you, you .. Someday I'll find a name for you. Stop it, Gunboat. - How about it, Mack? Laddie. If what you say is true, it's terrible. And murdering ships and killing men. I've been going to sea all my life. But I'd rather die than kill a sailor-man that way. So, that brings us right back to you again Al, doesn't it? You're wasting your time Nick. If there are ships being destroyed by bombs I know nothing about it. Well, maybe you know something about these figures. The combination for your safe. Or did you forget it? Now you know why that building happened to go sky-high today. You mean that warehouse where Dr Grisson .. Please Gunboat, will you do me a favor and .. Take a walk around the block? No. Shut up. What do you mean, take a walk round the block? Well .. Al every once in a while tells me to take a walk .. You idiot. Keep your mouth .. Oh, I see .. I get it Al. You don't want Gunboat to know about that sending-set. So when you use it, you tell him to take a walk around the block. Why would Al blow up ships? For the insurance. The reason he doesn't want you to see that sending-set .. Is that he knows you would have nothing to do with murdering sailors. Never I would. It's not my racket. I'm just Al's bodyguard. Will you keep out of this or not? Say, wait a minute Al. If what he says is true, you know I'd put the slug on you - just like that. Has he given you any proof? No. - Well .. That's right. Say, you ain't the guy to talk. You double-crossed me with my lady friend. You got me wrong, Gunboat. She's all yours. That's what you say. Well, now only this afternoon, I was talking with her and I said .. Dolores, I don't want you chasing after me, because you're in love with Gunboat. What did she say? Well she said, yes I love Gunboat, I love him very much, but .. Well .. I want to make him jealous. Did she say that? - That's what she said. Oh boy. So you see, Gunboat. I .. - Oh, I understand mate. I just had you all wrong. - Sure. And yet all along I kept saying to myself .. He ain't a bad guy. You lug-head, can't you see that .. Sure I see. We ain't been treating this guy right, Al. Say, if there's anything I can do, mate. - Yes you can. You can make him talk. I hate to do this, but uh .. Say, what is this, a convention of stowaways? Well, I guess the clam-bake is over, Al. Take us up to the Captain. John, I .. I must ask you to let me have one of your lifeboats. Al, we're 75 miles out. That's alright, Gunboat. Mack and I can reach Crist?bal. Well, if it's so urgent, I can turn about. But Al doesn't want to go in on this ship. Why? Because it's going to be blown up. Hidden somewhere on board are enough bombs to blow this thing to bits. It will go down with all hands on board like the Matlock and Toledo. What are you trying to do now Mr Carter, give us a scare? Ask Al. Al, what's he talking about? Al, why don't you say something? He's trying to frame me. Frame you? Why? Yes. Mr Carter has been trying to get me for a long time, Cora. He thought he could involve me in these .. Ship sinkings .. and destroy this boat and pin it on me, but .. I've got a line on Mr Carter. I happen to know where he planted those bombs. There is .. One hidden in that radio. And another one in the radio in engine-room. And they are to explode at midnight. In exactly two minutes. John, you'd better call the engine room and have them throw over that receiver. And throw this one overboard quick. Keep away from that phone or you die like a dog. Silence! Chuck this thing overboard. We'll throw that overboard after Al answers a few questions. You bombed the Toledo and Matlock? Answer yes or no. That's a lie. Is it? You worked with old Ramsell and Morris and shared the insurance monies. Didn't you? Throw the radios overboard and I'll tell everything. You'll tell everything before we throw them overboard. Come on. Yes .. I did it. Morris, Ramsell, Grisson. We are all in it. We sank the ships Toledo and Matlock. - And you killed Morris. Yes .. I killed Morris .. I did it. Stop the clock. Stop it. I did it. Carter has outsmarted you, Grisson. You and Al thought you could ditch me and get away with it. But I can tell Carter plenty. I .. Grisson. Don't. I'll keep quiet. Manos arriba. Well, so long mate. Thanks for squaring Mack and me with the Cops. Forget it. We knew you weren't in on it. Didn't we, Beeswax? 0f course. Sorry we can't stay for your wedding. - Yes. Too bad. What you say? How I am doing wrong number, Johnny. You're gorgeous. Humiliating. That's what it is. Let's go someplace where there aren't any women. I know just the place. Pier 37. - Si, Se?or. Central Airport. Hurry please. Central airport, and hurry. - Si, Se?or. That's not right. Well, if I'm wrong I'll apologize. -(s-d)-
