France. July 26th, 1794. Anarchy, misery, murder, arson, fear. These are the weapons of dictatorship. One voice is heard. The screech of the guillotine. France lies bleeding, Paris an open wound. The grab for power is on. Maximilian Robespierre, a fanatic with touted wig and twisted mind. Saint Just, connoisseur of roses and blood. Fouche the politician, always on both sides, never in the middle. Danton the soldier, savior of France. Francois Barras, citizen of the Republic. An honest man fighting for the life of his country. Tallien, another honest man. In 48 hours France will have a dictator, in 48 hours. Unless... It's a sad day when Frenchmen have to meet on enemy soil. The reign of terror swept to the borders of France. All the liberties we fought for in the revolution are being destroyed. Who is in power now? Maximilian Robespierre, he's demanding dictatorship. He's a madman, France must never have a dictator. You're the only man who could stop him general. I'm in exile Charles, a political prisoner. I don't dare escape from Austria, my face is too well known. You have to take my place. - Your orders sir. - I no longer give orders. I'm no longer the Marquis de Lafayette. A general without an army. A Frenchman without a country. All I can do is give you my blessing. There's a man in Strasbourg who'll help you. Show him this ring. Who are you? From the Marquis de Lafayette. You've come just in time, the plans are all set. Death. I demand death for the enemies of France. I denounce Danton, I demand death for Danton. - I demand the right to be heard. - Traitor. - Assassin. - You stand accused, guilty, condemned. - Who accuses me? - I, Robespierre. - Dictator. - Silence. - Your trial is over. - It hasn't begun. Citizens... What is your will? - Death. - Death. Citizens, open your eyes... tomorrow it may be you standing here, accused, condemned, unheard. Beware, Robespierre. The blood of Danton will choke in your throat. If you've come to beg for your husband's life you are late. Maximilian, what has come over you? Danton is your friend, your very good friend. Together you saved France, without Danton, where would you be today? I can't let personal feelings interfere. The people have found him guilty. The people? But you're the people, they do what you say. - Take out an appeal. - Who can I appeal to? Only you? Look at me, answer me, stop playing god. God? The revolution abolished god, it's only the will of the people and the people had spoken. - That's my chair you're sitting in Fouche. - I just wanted to see how it fits. Danton liked to sit in that chair too. And to think that he had supper with us only last night. Ah, it's amazing how fast you lose friends these days. And you never know who's next on the list Fouche. Must be quite a thrill making out your death list every night. Well, you sent for me, here I am. What's on your mind? I can't decide whether to promote you or denounce you. Where in all Paris would you find anybody as... disloyal, unscrupulous, scheming, treacherous, cunning or deceitful as I? - Oh, you have to do some tall looking Max. - Don't call me Max. You're not dictator, yes. - I will be. - Not without my help. - I know too much about you. - Get out of my chair. Is that the way to talk to your chief of secret police? - I'm ashamed of you Max. - Citizen Barras. I arrived just in time to see Danton on his way out. Exactly as you planned, wasn't it? Danton was my friend, not yours. Why should you feel badly about it? Because Danton was a good soldier. Without him, France would've been overrun by the armies of Europe. That was yesterday, like all good soldiers he outlived his usefulness. - Read that. - What is it? It's a motion I want you to place before the convention. Why, this would make you dictator of France. Yes. We didn't storm the Bastille to make any man dictator. I am not any man. I and my party will support no man... until there is an end to this mob violence, secret police and the wholesale murder. What you call mob violence is the Committee of Public Safety... which enjoys the confidence of the people. Anyone who challenges the committee is an enemy of the people. Where you belong citizen Barras? Not in this room. I don't think you handled that too well Max. Barras is not a man to be intimidated by words. He's the only man who can recommend you for dictator before the convention. You can't chop his head off. No, but Barras has many devoted friends. When their heads begin to fall, I'll think he'll come around to my way of thinking. There's no one in Paris who dare touch any of his party. Not even I do. No, but there's a man in Strasbourg who isn't afraid of anything. - A man named Duval. - Duval? - You know him? - No, but I know his record. 500 executions in a single month. That's almost as good as yours Max. I've sent for Duval, he arrives at the Blue Goose inn tonight. You go there and bring him to the bakery, I'll meet him there. How will I know him? As one snake to another... you smell each other out. - Welcome citizen, welcome. - I'm Duval, public prosecutor of Strasbourg. - Will you have dinner? - Just show me to my room. I'm expecting an escort from Paris, see that I'm not disturbed until he comes. Rest assured citizen Duval. Good night citizen. - I'm sorry but there is no room to be had. - I've come to see citizen Duval. - He left orders not to be disturbed. - He'll see me. - Which is his room? - Please do not make a disturbance. - Come back tomorrow. - Which door? - Or must I awaken all of your guests? - All right, first door to the left. - Who's there? - A messenger from Paris. Don't move. What's the message? - It's so dark in here. - I can hear in the dark, speak. It's a written message, I need light. It's a candle on the bureau. - Light it for me. - Just hand me the message and you can go. I was told to wait for an answer. Please light the candle. Why are you so anxious for a lightened room? Don't you recognize the voice of Duval? I've never met you before citizen Duval. Well if you don't know me what good will a light do? - Or are you afraid I might not be Duval? - Who else could you be? That depends on who sent the message. Only two men in Paris can send messages beyond the border. Robespierre and Barras. Which one sent you? It's a dangerous question to answer in the dark. One of us has to make the first move. Courtesy demands you speak first. - Barras. - Thank heaven. What happened to the real Duval? He's dead. - What did you do with the body? - My men were waiting below. Quick, what's the message? Robespierre's men will come to pick me up at any minute. Barras wants you to report to Robespierre, gain his confidence... even if you must betray some of us to keep his confidence. Few lives won't matter but Robespierre must never become dictator. - How can I prevent that? - You get further orders from Paris. - From whom? - From me. Well, if we're to recognize each other I suppose we might as well have a look. Charles. You're looking very well Madelon. I had no idea such prosperity went with the revolution. You don't seem to have suffered much either. What did you expect me to do when you walked out? Stop breathing? - I couldn't explain to you... - You can explain now. We'll have a bottle of wine over old times. Perhaps I can get the innkeeper to come up and play the violin. Explanations always sound better with music. I don't blame you for hating me. I don't like to deprive you of that satisfaction Madelon, I don't hate you. I just don't care anymore. I'll be at the cafe Velavinted. After seeing Robespierre, please come there Charles, please. Seems I remember an appointment we had four years ago. Only one of us showed up. Stupid one. Well Charles is grown up to be a smart boy now. - I'll be waiting. - I wouldn't count the minutes. - Who was that? - She came to see citizen Duval. Interesting. Citizen Duval, your escort has... - What's the matter with you? - You look so different citizen Duval. Different? Why should the appearance of a public prosecutor interest you so much citizen? - You haven't by chance a guilty conscience? - No no, citizen prosecutor, I'm a patriot. It was the wig, yes of course, the wig. So... you're the terror of Strasbourg. - I'd recognize you anywhere citizen Fouche. - You had a visitor, I see. - All work and no play? - I thought you enjoyed your work. The real pleasure of my work went out with the guillotine. It's all over too fast now, even hanging. That lasts but a few moments, no citizen Fouche... what this country needs is an elegant, slow death. Give a man four hours to die, it's worth watching. Let's try it sometime, shall we? Anyone in particular? Robespierre has a beautiful long list. We're gonna have some great times together, eh Duval? Yes, I can hardly wait. Duval... - you don't know me and I don't know you. - It's good start. We might be able to do each other some good. What do you think? You haven't said anything yet. Suppose you tell me why Robespierre sent for you. I was just going to ask you that. Oh, come Duval, you can trust me. Can I? No. One thing about Paris, never dull. Dull? - What is this? - Robespierre's headquarters. - A bakery? - He loves hot biscuits in the morning. Welcome to Paris citizen Duval. - It's a pleasure. - I never shake hands, it's unsanitary. Your barber? - Ask him again where it is. - Where is it? Why won't you eat your bun? - Good, eh? - Delicious. Remove the body. The people of Paris are becoming more stubborn every day. - We have the same trouble in Strasbourg. - I congratulate you on your record there. It's becoming monotonous. We'll do our very best to make it exciting for you here. Fouche, why don't you take a walk? The streets aren't safe this hour of the night. Oh well. - I expected an older man. - So did I I'm the eldest of our group, this past may I was 36. Fouche is 35 and... Danton would've been 34 had he lived. - How old are you? - I hope to reach your age anyway. However, age makes men tolerant and these are no times for tolerance. We're living in a perpetual state of violence. People had become a blood thirsting mob that thrives on human lives. Each day this monster must drink its quota. It's only one man who can control this beast and that man must be dictator of France. - What's there to stop you? - A black book. - A black book? - My secret file. In it a list of the names of all the enemies of France and the proof of their crimes. It's in this book that I select the daily quota for the guillotine. Yesterday this book disappeared. Well, why not make up another one? You don't understand... some of the names are men who work on my own committee. They suspect, yet nobody knows for sure whether his name's on the list it's this fear which gives me control of the convention. Once they know they're on the list they'll all join forces. I can hold them one by one, but not as a group. That's why it's imperative that I get this black... book back before its contents become known. That's the real reason why I sent for you, nobody knows about it but you. Whom do you suspect of taking it? I know of only one man who... if he had the book, would have the courage to use it against me. Barras, one of the leaders of the opposition party. I'd like to meet this Barras. Well it won't be easy, he's gone into hiding until the convention meets. You'll act a special agent for the Committee of Public Safety. Here's your authority for power over all police personnel. - Fouche too? - Over everyone, except me. - You have 24 hours. - Not much time. Convention meets day after tomorrow, we must have the book back by then. And if I fail? As you said Duval, these are no times for tolerance. I don't tolerate failures. Well... - where we do we start? - Start what? Whatever it is, aren't we going to work together? - I think tonight calls for a one man job. - Well, I'm the man. - Yes, but she might not like the idea. - Can't your diversions wait? You see, I may only be in Paris 24 hours. All right, driver. Wait around the corner. All by yourself citizen? Madelon is expecting me. Sit down, sit down. Nice evening gentlemen. - You wish to see Madelon? - She told me to meet her here. - Who are you? - Who are you? - Friend of Madelon. - So was I once. Here she comes. You wanted to see me? - I asked to see Madelon. - I am Madelon. At another time... in another place, I might accept you as Madelon. That will be all Evelyn. He's nice. - I haven't got all night citizen. - Don't just sit. Order something. If it isn't the terror of Strasbourg. - I don't think we were introduced. - Saint Just is the name. The shadow of Robespierre. Wherever he goes, I go. Except here. He doesn't like women. - Come on, join my party. - Some other time Saint Just. - You don't like women either? - I'm a little tired tonight. No one goes to bed in Paris, it isn't safe to go to bed. I've had so many friends, all killed in bed. - Fouche's secret police. - Thanks for warning me. I have a friend in Strasbourg, Henry Duponte. - No doubt you know him. - I can't say that I do. Good, he doesn't live in Strasbourg. It's very amusing. You know something? I don't think you are Duval. - No? - You don't look like a butcher. On first glance one could almost mistake you for a human being. Saint Just, we missed you. You see, I am a human being. This way. You choose your friends unwisely, Saint Just is an enemy. - Who sent you? - Shall we finish him? Not here. - Thanks for a most cordial reception. - My friends are sometimes too impersonal. Come on up Charles. Close the door Charles. Come over here Charles. Closer. Closer. Just one kiss and four years are wiped out. Life is not that simple Madelon, not even for you. Go on, pour out your bitterness. I drank it up in buckets of sweet wine. Tell me about the women that went with the wine. They were all called Madelon, They had your eyes, your... mouth... the same false smile. Tell me more, make me jealous. They even kissed like you, with soft, warm lips. Like this? Exactly. You are a stranger Charles. We really don't know each other anymore. But I have no intention of renewing the acquaintance. - Then why did you come here tonight? - To find Barras. Unfortunately, you're my only contact. - Why should you want to help him? - Because I'm a Frenchman... and there's only one man who can save France and put an end to this terror... - Barras. - I wish I were that confident. I trust this man Madelon. Even though he doesn't have the usual reaction to your charm. - Have you met with Robespierre? - I just left him. - Were you followed? - I'm sure I was but there's no time to lose. Day after tomorrow he's going to ask the convention to appoint him dictator. Robespierre must never become dictator. - Ever hear of the black book? - The death list. Well the book is gone. - Who has it? - Well I was hoping it was you. If only I did have it, I could put the entire convention into a frenzy against him. It's the secret police, they got the cafe surrounded. You have to go this way, hurry. Quick. Just one more kiss and I have melted. - Citizen Barras, you're under arrest. - He's my prisoner. - Was. - Is. I'm afraid you're a little confuse Duval, I'm the chief of police. You were chief of police. My authorization from Robespierre. Now if you be so kind as to leave. Good work Duval. I was afraid Fouche was going to outsmart you. Come in Barras. You had a strenuous day Duval, I'll see that our friend gets to prison safely, good night. Upstairs. - Madelon... - Shut up. Your friend delivered Barras right into the hands of Saint Just. - That wasn't part of my plan. - I saw it with my own eyes. What are you waiting for Tellian? Shoot him. Which side are you on? Well, looks like I'm in the middle. But if you give me a chance I might be able to save Barras. We're wasting time. For heaven's sakes Madelon, can't you see I'm not lying? Frankly, no. Just because I refused a kiss, you'd have me killed. Since when have you put such a price on your kisses? - Shoot him. - You know I'm not Duval, so did she. Give me a chance to free Barras. There are only three men in our party who could possibly have the book. - You know who they are. - He's lying we can get rid of him later. It's worth the risk. Lambert. Exciting enough for you citizen Duval? You've seen Castel and Bernard and now Lambert. Somebody got here first. - Then you know about the black book. - Nobody keeps secrets from me. Nothing is been disturbed in any of the rooms. Your companion has good eyes. No one of these men ever had the black book. - Then why were they silenced? - Only Robespierre can answer that. - Or perhaps you citizen Fouche. - Who? Me? Well, much as I dislike to tear myself away. Looks as though I'll have to, unless of course you still insist on shooting me. - I made a mistake Charles. - Your mistake almost cost me my life. Your life isn't worth much unless you save Barras. Doesn't sound like the Madelon who had her arms around me a while ago. But I guess you're pretty free with your arms these days, aren't you? Don't tempt me, I still have the gun. What ever happened to the Madelon I once knew? You had a chance to find out. That chance won't come again. - You sure of that? - Positive. - Still wanna shoot me? - I could kill you. It's a revolution going on. Don't stay out late. What you say, Saint Just, disturbs me. I'm not sure, but it looked as if he were trying to help Barras to escape. - The man's record is perfect. - Duval's record is perfect. Eh? What do you mean? Fouche told me about an incident that happened at the inn. The innkeeper didn't seem to recognize Duval the second time he saw him. I need proof, Duval is a powerful man in Strasbourg. I can't afford to antagonize his element there. You'll have proof. His wife arrives at noon today. - Citizen Duval. - Send him in. Well, good morning gentlemen. We had a profitable night, Barras is in prison and three of his best men dead. - What about the book? - It's why I'm here. Your time is getting short. Why did you kill Castel, Bernard, and Lambert last night? What makes you think it was me? It wasn't Fouche, Barras is in prison and I didn't do it. - That leads only you Saint Just. - Let credit fall where credit is due. I'll never find the book if he keeps killing off the only people I can question. Dead enemies make good friends. You know, if I'm to be of any service to you, you got to take me into your confidence. What is it you'd like to know? In all three rooms of the slain men nothing was disturbed. No attempt was made to search for the black book. I want to know why. Perhaps you better answer that, Saint Just. You have the reputation for being a clever man Duval. Suppose you find the answers. Thank you, I will. We should hold him till we're sure. I always believe in giving a man enough rope. I've come to question the prisoner Barras. The Committee of Public Safety's authority is good enough for me. Just shout when you're finished. Barras... - What do you want? - I didn't turn you in Barras. Saint Just just happened to be in your... carriage, you got to trust me, I'm here to help you. I don't need your help, citizen prosecutor, terror of Strasbourg. I'm not Duval, I'm Charles D'Aubigny. - Lafayette? - I'm his agent. What trick is it this time? Last night Castel, Bernard, and Lambert were assassinated. - By whom? - Saint Just. Then it's all over. There's only one way I can save you. - We've got to find that black book. - I told you was none of my men. - Then why were they killed last night? - Part of some fiendish plot of Robespierre. None of the rooms of the murdered men were searched. If they weren't killed for the black book, what's behind it all? Fear, divide and conquer. Plot as old as Caesar. Robespierre's plan is to break up the party. Since the book disappeared some of my men have already come to distrust each other. Last night's murders will make them even more unsure. By the time the convention meets, there'll be no one to oppose his dictatorship. But if the book's still missing, how we dare face the convention? Some of his own men are listed in that book. Then why haven't they come forward? Whoever has it wouldn't keep silent. - One man would. - Who? - Robespierre. - Robespierre? He never lost the book... - it was never out of his possession. - Then why... Don't you see what he accomplished with a single lie? He's had us all on a wild goose chase searching for something that was never lost. That's why those rooms weren't disturbed, there was nothing to look for. If he has it... then he will become dictator. Guard, guard. D'aubigny. If you should find it and I'm not there... give it to Tallien. He'll have the courage to use it. You'll be there. Hurry up guard. - Guard. - What's your hurry my friend? - The convention doesn't meet till tomorrow. - Unlock this door. - Is that an order? - It's a command. - By whose authority? - By authority of Robespierre. Just a precaution Duval, if you are Duval... By the way, I have a good news for you. Your wife is on her way from Strasbourg. She should be here at any minute now. Why don't you just relax until she comes? Robespierre and I wouldn't want to miss the happy reunion. Citizen Robespierre. - What are your prisoners doing out here? - This is today's batch for the guillotine. Shoot them out. - Citizens Duval, Saint Just. - Greetings. Fetch citizen Duval. I apologize for inconveniencing you. I was looking for an excuse to get to Paris, there so many things I want to buy. Bobo. Bobo, bobo, bobo. - Bobo, what are you doing in jail? - Well I... - Now what is the silly boy done? - Nothing. Was just a slight misunderstanding, my apologies, Duval. You see, in my position, one can't be too careful. I compliment you on your thoroughness. You too Saint Just. Come bobo. Yes, my love. Wait for me, I was told I could find citizen Robespierre here. - And who wishes to see citizen Robespierre? - Madame Duval. Inform citizen Robespierre that madame Duval desires an audience. - I'm not accustomed to being kept waiting. - Perhaps citizen Saint Just can help you. At your service madame. I'll speak to no one but citizen Robespierre. - We all make mistakes. - No one is perfect. - Where's madame Duval? - I am madame Duval. Get him. That was close, how you know about Duval's wife? One of our men recognized her at the border, Lucille took her place. - We got to get out of Paris. - Drop me at the bakery. - Greetings Duval. - Greetings patriot. Is Robespierre returned? He's over to prison on some important business. That's what I like to hear. - Greetings citizen Duval. - Greetings patriot. Greetings patriot. Nice patriot. Greetings to you, patriot. Last I heard you were in jail. That fool Saint Just didn't think I was Duval. - But of course you proved otherwise. - Of course. Saint Just is a fool, please Charles. No violence. You once spoke about working together Fouche. The offer I made was to Duval but I'd make to you the same offer. - After all we both out for the same thing. - But I know where it is. Where? What are you after? Once Robespierre is eliminated I want joint power with Barras. - Only Barras can give you that. - Barras is in no position to bargain now. - What's your answer? Me or Robespierre? - You're the lesser of two evils Fouche. You have my word, we got into his room. - What for? - The black book in Robespierre's own room? - It was never out of that room. - What? Oh? What a clever rascal, I'm afraid I underestimated Max. Hurry up Fouche. You forget this is not my regular profession. It's not in the desk. It's got to be in this room. Now, there's your black book. All you have to do is to find the right one. It'll take forever to go through all this. Maybe we'll be lucky, you start over there. Fouche, Fouche... Look the names. - Is my name in it? - Let's see... Barras, Lafayette... Tallien, Berdam... Fouche. Seize him. Do something. Some cabbages citizen? Freshly cut last night. Artichokes? Pierre, this customer is asking for artichokes. - Artichokes are out of season. - I was told I could find some here. They're very expensive, how many did you want? Three large, three small. I thought you'd never get here. - I almost didn't. - Did you find it? Gendarmes are going through the marketplace, they must be looking for you. - Won't be safe anywhere in Paris. - What about your sister's farm? Good. You can hide out there until the convention meets tomorrow. Keep this, will be safer with you. - I'll go with Charles. - Never get out of the city in those clothes. I'll get you some others. We meet tomorrow at daybreak in the cafe of the Living Dead, good luck. - Where are your papers? - I told you, I lost them. But ask anyone in the market, they'll tell you who we are. I am not interested in who you are but who you gave your papers too. Is it against the law to lose one's papers? No, but it's treason to give them to a traitor. But a traitor found our papers, we can't help that. - Where is your horse and cart? - In the stables where we always leave them. Your stall is empty. - Oh well, they've been stolen. - Arrest them. Make them talk. - They won't talk now. - We'll catch them at the farm, come on. Show your papers. - Farmers, eh? - No. I'm the viscount Charles D'Aubigny and this is Marie Antoinette. See here where you passed through only this morning with a full load of cabbages. - Sure sold them awfully fast. - There are a lot of hungry people in Paris. - Where is your farm? - About four kilometers from here. Then you must pass through here often, don't recall seeing your faces before. Cabbages don't grow overnight my friend. - What else do you raise? - Chickens, pigs. Pierre... - I'll let you through on one condition. - What's that? Next time you come through you bring us a couple of chickens. I don't know, you'll have to ask my wife about that. One chicken. Two chickens. - Small ones. - Not too small. - Yes? - We're friends of Pierre. - What's happened? - Oh nothing, Pierre will be here tomorrow. We'd like to stay for the night. Come in. - Have you had your supper? - Not yet. I just want a bed. Who are you? I'm the terror of Strasbourg. Come on now, finish your milk and off to bed. - Sit down. - Thank you. - Are they Pierre's? - Yes. It's a pity they have to grow up in times like these. You can be thankful they don't live in Paris. Sometimes I wish that Louis were still king. Don't say that. We're never going back, we're trying to build a better world, it's not easy. But we never going back. Does anyone know where we're heading? - Did you ever live on a farm? - I was born on one. - What is it? - Look. Wake your man, run to the fields, I'll hide the cart. Charles, Charles wake up. The soldiers are coming. Charles. That way. Anybody home? - Is anybody home? - Just grandma. - Where is she? - Bringing in Celeste. - Who is Celeste? - My, my, my cow. - Where's your mother and father? - They, they went to the market. Have you seen any strangers? Have you? What do you want here? We're looking for a man and woman, traitors to the Republic. Well, you won't find them in that bed. This is the farm of Pierre and Marie Blanchard, isn't it? Pierre is my son. Your son and his wife have been arrested for treason. No. If we don't find the traitors they'll both be executed tomorrow. If you know anything grandma, you better speak up now. I know nothing. You never get anything out of these farmers. All right, search the fields. Bring me some food and wine. I'm thirsty grandma. Who's that man? - A soldier of the Republic. - What's he want? He's thirsty too. Come here, little one. Would you like to be a soldier when you grow up? You could have a horse, sword... and a gun. You'd like that, wouldn't you? But a good soldier never lies, he always tells the truth. Have you seen any strangers today, a man and a woman? You can tell me, one soldier to another. - Will I get a horse? - You can have mine. - Well? - I didn't see anybody. More wine for a soldier of the Republic? - Swine. - What's that you said? More wine? Well? - Not a trace of them, anywhere. - Can't get very far with a horse and cart. Maybe they've gone to the next town. They got to be in Paris by tomorrow morning. This is as far as they'd go, keep searching. I left the men those orders. I'm dead on my feet. I'm going to take a nap, wake me up in a half an hour.. You're not going to disturb the children? I'll take the cot, get me a pillow. Never mind. I said never mind. What are you doing? I was just covering him. Get away from there. - It's Saint Just. - Where? Sleeping on the cot. - He must've found the book. - No, he'd be gone now if he had. He must be sleeping right on it if it's still there. No no, don't get up. It's a sergeant sitting at the table. The soldiers will be back any minute. Get in there and put a stop to it. - We're safe now I think. - No, wait a minute. We didn't lose them. They'll overtake us riding double, we better hide in here. These woods are full of caverns, they can't search every one of them. - Think they've gone? - I better have a look. Spread your men outside the woods. We'll wait here for them to come out. They're laying a trap for us in the woods. - There must be another way to Paris. - Only the main road. If only the moon weren't so bright we could make a run for it. We better wait, maybe the clouds will cover the moon. There are the clouds, you have to ride fast. Don't look back. Where has Charles D'Aubigny taken the book? To whom? I'm asking you for the last time. Make her talk. Up to your old tricks, eh? I know a much better way to get the black book. What is your way? It has to be quick, the convention meets in less than an hour. Let her down. This earring will have more persuasion than any of your tortures. I'll meet you at the convention. You've done well Charles, this day will see the end of the terror.. - I'll go back for Madelon now. - Take some men with you. Please gentlemen. Not so rough. Congratulations. - You came very close Charles. - Not quite close enough, it seems. Oh, I have something for you. - Where is she? Where is she? - Being entertained by Robespierre. It's either Madelon or the book, can't have both. The convention meets in less than 10 minutes. Without this Robespierre will become dictator. Whereon many more will die, France will die. Bring the prisoner Francois Barras. This is not a trial. Barras is not a prisoner of the bar. You are not judges, you are statesmen and representatives of the nation. In your hands lies the fate of France. You have not to pass sentence for or against a single man. This man is already a self confessed traitor by opposing the will of the convention. It is you, the members of the convention... who must take a resolution on the question of public safety... and to decide a question of national foresight. It is with regret that I pronounce the fatal truth. Barras ought to perish rather than this convention be torn with disunity. Barras must die... that the country may live. Madelon. Madelon. There is a cord about the throat of Liberty and both ends I held by... traitors like Barras and his party. I demand a decree of accusation against them. I demand a declaration of national emergency. I demand a suspension of all legal procedures. I demand that this convention by unanimous vote vest... in me the authority of sole and absolute dictatorship. - Never. - No. - Down with dictators. - I denounce Robespierre. - We must uphold Liberty. - Never. No dictator for France. Citizens... - You'll destroy yourselves. - I denounce Robespierre. Down with Robespierre. - Down on his head. - Danton's blood will choke in your throat. Take him to the guillotine. Citizens... Max, they'll kill us. Death is no stranger to me. The mob is gone mad, they'll tear us to pieces. I made the mob, the mob are my children. They won't turn against their father. If it is my life you want, take it. One more life isn't important. What is important is the will of the people. I fought to give the people the right to exercise their own will. I fought to give France back to the people. Blood is poured freely. If more blood is needed, you can have mine. The greatest death that a man can die is for his own people. But you will be a mob without a leader. If I go, who takes my place? Let the man step forward who would fallow the steps of Robespierre. I have led you through the darkness. If I sought the power of dictatorship, it is not for personal glory. Your will is my will. - I bear no man vengeance. - Shut his mouth. I have killed only for you. - Where is she Saint Just? Where is she? - Only Robespierre knows. - Take him to the guillotine. - What have you done with Madelon? - It's no use, he'll never speak again. - To the guillotine. Robespierre's last monuments. He planned on having statues built of himself. All he leaves behind him... stale bread. The end is always being put to some use in France citizen. The art of being a Frenchman is knowing what comes next. Have you any idea? I am neither a Frenchman nor a politician, I am merely a soldier. Well there friend, must be off. Perhaps we shall meet again sometime. Oh by the way, I don't believe I got your name. My name is Bonaparte, Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon Bonaparte, I'll try to remember.
