- Please, please, please. - Yeah, every season. They ping a ton of that stuff out of there, it's all evasive, but we'll make sure we get it out. You know what? Yeah, it's just fine, just fine. What we'll do is, I can be over there about three o'clock today, does that work? Be over there at three? That's great, talk to you later. So, hey guys. What's up? - Hello, do you want me to sit here? Yeah, this won't take too long, will it? Because I've got a lot to do today. Just let me know when you're rolling. - Hi, my name is Brian Leverman, I am a town councilman for Paradox Lake, New York. - Hi, my name is Debra Keller. I am executive director of the Hand of God. Welcome. - So, what do you want to know? Paradox Lake is a small community, only a few miles long, but we've got a lot going on. We've got a couple of restaurants, there's a brewery, got camps that run all year round. There is, of course, the lovely lake where people go swimming, fishing, camping. - Um, I guess I should ask. I hope you don't mind if I eat during this, I really get a little loopy if I go more than a couple hours without eating. Oh, great. Wonderful. Are you sure? My name is Dr. Albert Clarkson, and I'm a historian specializing in American cults, specifically from, say, the 1940s to the 1970s. How was that, was that okay? Good, good. So, um, what kind of movie are you making? - Oh, you mean the Hand of God? The Hand of God is one of the staples in the area. They run youth summer camps and provide our faith based community a place to find God. - Oh, honey, it's the Hand of God. Of course. The Hand of God creates faith defining experiences that give young people and families the opportunity to encounter God, and to grow in their spiritual walks of life. - Hand of One is nonsense. It's an urban legend. As far as I know, there have never been any cults that have lived in the area. - The whole origin story is a complete fabrication made up as an excuse to discriminate against our organization. We are now, and always have been, a peaceful society. - Oh wow, man. You picked a good one. Wait a second. I really like this, this is gonna be fun. Okay, here we go, here we go. The Hand of One originally started around 1953 by a man named Vernon Korsch. Now, Vernon was a young mechanic from the Albany region. I mean, he was said to be normal, you know, a bit of a drinker, before having an encounter with this young woman named Meredith Parlor in the Adirondack town of Schroon Lake. Vernon claimed that this woman had some supernatural abilities, and that she would grant him the chance at eternal life in exchange for a sacrifice. Now, after a few years, Vernon really became obsessed with the idea, and then in August of 1953, he began recruiting for the Hand of One. He got 20 men who would compete in a three day survival test. The last man remaining would be deemed the chosen one. Back in October of 1953, it was a bloodbath. - What up! Kip. - Yeah? - Where are we going? - We are gonna go to-- Moon Lake. - Why is everyone talking? - Hey! - What's up? Oh, I thought-- Grace. - I didn't real-- - You're so pretty. Best boyfriend in the world. - Yeah, yeah, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa! - And he finds out that not only has Thomas Wayne taken over the role of Batman, well it's more like a Batman with big guns and shit, but he also finds out-- - Can we really take it easy with the Snapchat stories this weekend? Come on, how is that any different from me taking pictures all the time? - How is Snapchat different than photography? Photography? - Yeah. Dude, I started taking pictures of our freakin' car accident the other day. - You know, just for everyone's sanity, I'm not gonna to go into it all right now, but trust me... - Okay. - Ugh! - What is it you do again? - What? I'm an entrepreneur! - Right. - Hey, man! Don't question that shit. You can find me, Tommy123Hotstuff5. That's right, ladies love Tommy D, baby! - This Adirondack moon house on Moon Lake. - Schroon Lake, baby. - It's just like, it keeps giving me weird directions, it keeps getting off, and turning around, I'm confused. Did you book somewhere without WiFi? - No, I would never do that. Did you book somewhere without service? - If we get here, dude, and we ain't got no damn signal... I don't know what's gonna happen, but something's gonna happen. - Well, whatever. Do you think you can find the place at least? - There's no way, maybe break out the old paper map here. - Yeah, actually, Tommy, can you get the paper map? Are you fucking kidding me? - Yeah, sure, let me pull it out my ass. Ya'll don't do that? What are you talking about? - Cancel out the noise. What noise? - The white noise. Hey, got ya! The beautiful Adirondacks. Lonely, so peaceful. - Got to take a piss. On a scale of one to 10, that's a 10, 10! Wait, Tommy, do you have to pee? - Yeah, I have to pee. Why didn't you just say something earlier, I mean-- - Well, I did, man! I've been saying it for miles! How much further? - Ladies and gentlemen, here's our turn. - Woo! Oh my God! Thank God, 'cause I have to piss. - Tommy, you have to pee? You hear that? You think we can make it? - I'd rather check. Here's your chance to empty your bladders. - Only gotta tell me once. - There's bears out there. - What's wrong with it? - I think it's the alternator. Do you have service? - Mm... Negative. Grace? - No, sorry. - So, how are you doing? - I'm fine. Why? - No, I was just checking. You know, I'm glad you decided to come. - Yeah, I'm glad too. Yeah, it'll be fun. I just have to pee. - Hey, go in the woods. I will stand guard. - Uh, no, I'll wait. You won't get anything out here, I've tried. - Uh, thanks. That sucks. - You guys having car troubles? - Uh, yeah but I don't think it's a big deal. - You want one? - Um... I should really get back to my friend. - Yeah, okay. Let me know if I can help. - Yeah sure, you too. Hey Tommy, what you doing? - Uh... - Who's your friend? - Sorry, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Tommy. - Thomas. - Well yeah, but my friends call me Tommy. - Um, I'm Thomas. - Hey, Megan. - Guys need any help? - Um, yeah, if you know anything about cars. - I could take a look. - Awesome. Hey guys, this is Thomas. - Hi. Hello there. - Grace. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hey, name's Kip, nice to meet you. - You guys mind if I try something? - Sure, go ahead. - The belt's shot, and you need to get it fixed. Should start if you hold the gas down when you turn the ignition on. - Got it, thanks. - So, Thomas, where ya headed? - Honestly, I don't really know right now. Just got out of school and just starting to drift, ya know? Do you guys want some beers? - Oh no, man, I think we're good. Hell yeah. - Okay. - Sure. - You gotta shotgun with me. - Thank you. - Okay. Thanks. Oh my... God! - Sorry! - Woo! So, what about you guys? - Uh, we're just heading down the road a little bit to our weekend getaway lake house. - Yeah, you wanna come? - Oh, I mean, if you don't mind-- - Actually, Kip, do we have room? I mean like, the rental agreement. Like, isn't there a limit? - Yeah. I mean, I'd have to check it out, I'm not sure how much space we have left. But we'd love to have you. - It's all good. Just gonna keep on drifting. - Nice to meet ya. You too, Tommy. - Bye. - Sorry, Tommy. All right. Who wants a beer? - Ah, let's stretch. - Yo, Kip, this place is tight. - I know, man. I showed you the photos. All right, let's check this shit out. - Come in close. Here we go. Drinking right here, right here, right here, right here. - The name of the game is finger game. Now, put your finger on it. You, say, I'm guessing, like it's my turn, I go three! And if there's three fingers on then I win, and it goes to the next person, and if Kip fucks up and is like two and there's like five people on... Like one person's left and then if their finger. - God, that's good. And then she'd complain. - I think Thomas should start. Thomas, you know the rules. Play fair. - Three. - Get the fuck out of here. That son of a bitch winning at everything. Yeah! Yeah! Woo! - Listen man, I'm telling you. You got all these computers, right? You got all these people, they're trying to catch the dollar, catch the dollar, catch the dollar, but you can't catch the dollar 'cause the dollars are flyin', baby. Fuckin' Jordan Belford, man. - Look what I got. There are samurai swords. - Yo, I think that's a-- - You're a samurai. - Look. - Okay, yo, yo, Megan, you might want to be careful with that. - I'm just like... - What the fuck? - Yo, what the fuck's your problem? - Grace. - Hey. Want this? - Thanks. - How you doin'? - I'm fine. - So, are we ever gonna talk about what happened? - Um... No. No, we're not. - You know we can. - All right, let's go! Super nachos! Here we go. Everything, everything, right here! ¶ Done messed up bad again ¶ ¶ I've lost another friend ¶ ¶ And you know this ¶ ¶ Yeah, you know this ¶ ¶ Then, since we both got away ¶ My tattoo? - Is... It's not dumb, anyway. - It's not dumb? - No. - I'm glad it's not dumb. It's a little dumb? - Yeah. ¶ If you'd answer me ¶ ¶ I will help you tell the truth ¶ ¶ I know you don't believe in learning lessons ¶ ¶ Another marvelous reason to walk away ¶ - So, do you often wander alone in the woods with a case of beer? - Um... More often than you think. - Really? ¶ All you know in love gets stripped away ¶ ¶ And now you're filled with drugs ¶ - Oh, hey. Check this out. Oh, Jesus. Careful. - Oh, it's fine. It's not loaded. Probably hasn't been shot in years. My dad used to take me shooting when I was young. My mom hated it. - I've actually been on the road for a little while. I've been hanging with a lot of truck drivers. - How's that? - Well, if you think last night was crazy... - Good morning, everyone. Where's Kip? - He went out for more food and beer. - Good man. - So, what's on the list for today? - We could go for a hike. - Blah. Whoa. When did we take that? How drunk was I last night? - Very. - Seriously, I don't remember taking this, and it's day time. Come here. What the fuck? - You don't remember it because we never took this. - Um, what? - Unless I'm forgetting? We took a picture, but that was in the kitchen, right? - No, we never took this. - Okay, again, why is there a photo of us randomly here? - I don't know. - Good morning party people! - Were you under there the whole time? - I must've gotten hungry again. - Tommy, do you know anything about this picture? - Well, that's weird. - You know what? Kip probably brought like an old photo of us to like celebrate friendship or something. Kip stuff. - Yeah. But why is he in the picture? And who was taking it? - He likes to use the photo timer on his phone. - Still. - Maybe it's just Kip trying to play a prank on us. - You don't know anything about this, do you, Thomas? - Absolutely not. - All right. We'll just wait for Kip to get home and ask him about it then. I'm sure it's just some stupid prank. - Weird fuckin' prank, but sounds good to me. - I don't know anything about it. - All right, cool. Dude, everyone's stuck in this place, and they're like freaking out and shit. One girl like, frickin' like, cuts her frickin' skin dude, and starts peeling it off, blood's everywhere. That shit is fuckin'-- - Dude, Tommy, I told you I didn't see this movie. I haven't seen it, I'm not gonna see it. - Well, how the hell did you not see the movie? - I don't watch comic book movies! - It's not a comic book movie! - Whatever. - So... What if it's not a prank? - What? What, Thomas? - Dude, we have no idea what that guy's problem is. We just met him on the side of the road yesterday. What if this is all part of his plan? Like, to scare us and then kill us. - Eh, I don't think so. - What if it's something supernatural? What if this is like some "LOST" shit? Like we did take that picture, but we just don't remember it. Or, better yet, what if we're all dead, like right now. Like "Sixth Sense" or "The Others". You know what I'm saying? Or, it could be some "Devil Rejects" shit, and Thomas has got some psycho Manson Family out there hiding in the woods, lurking, just ready to kill us one by one. - Yeah, or we could like not live in a movie, and Kip's just pranking us? Dude, Tommy, please. You have got to chill out. Come on, I'm not dealing with this the whole weekend. Take it down. - Thanks. - What are you up to? - This photo. It's perfect. There was no way someone could've made this. - You could do a lot with Photoshop, you know. I mean, have you seen those shark pictures? The one with the surfer and the great white swimming in the wave? - Yeah, but someone would've had to come here and immediately get to work on this and then print it. - Did you check for a printer? I'm just saying, you never know. Hey, you want to check out the lake? - Yeah. You head in, I'll catch up with you guys later. - Come on, Grace. Come out and play. - What the fuck, you guys? This isn't funny. What are you talking about? This photo. You took this? - Yeah, but I didn't print it, and I sure as hell didn't send it to anyone else. Did someone sneak into my room and steal my phone while I was sleeping last night? - I didn't. - No, not at all. - Oh, you know what? They could've hacked you, like The Fappening. - What's Fappening? - The Fappening. Someone hacked a bunch of celebrities and stole their nudes off their phones. You asked! - Megan, I want to go home. I want to go home right now. - No, no, come here. Look. We were all pretty drunk last night. Are you sure you didn't send it to anyone? - No. I want to go home, this was a mistake. - I get it, look. First of all, Kip has the car. Okay, he should be back anytime now, and then we can sort this all out. We're definitely all dead. - Where the fuck is Kip? You said he went to get beers? - Maybe he got lost. Shit. - You know, if he got lost, he'd have to drive back tow here there was signal, and I don't really know how far away that is. - Hey guys, come here. Seriously, what is it? - There's a fucking guy. There's a fucking guy in the background watching us. - Probably just some locals fucking with us, just to be safe. - Fuck, Kip. - Hey guys? Do you see something out there? Out there by that tree? - Holy shit! - Let's go, Tommy. - What? Are you fucking kidding me? Dude, I don't know if you know it or not, but we are perfectly safe in here. You just locked all the doors. - Like I said, it's probably just some locals. Let's go out there and scare them off. The only reason they're scary right now is because you can't see them, right? Grab something. Or I'll go out there myself. - Fuck! So, when we find this guy, what's the plan? - A, we scare him off, B, we kick his ass. - What about C, he has a gun, kills us both, and he kills our friends. - Shh, shh, shut up. - You hear that? - Yeah. You got my back? - Yeah, I think. - Wait. - Megan, Megan, Megan, Megan! - Thomas, Thomas! You all right? - Yeah, I think so. Is he dead? - No. Okay, grab his hands. - What, why? - We don't want him out here sneaking around, pulling anymore of this shit. - I thought the plan was to scare him off, you don't think that did the trick? - We're gonna tie him up, put him in the garage. We'll get the cops in the morning. Tie up the hands. - All right. - Are you sure this is the best idea? - I think we should hold him here for the night, get the cops in the morning. Should be fine, I mean, he's an old man. - He knew your name. - What do you mean? - He kept saying "Megan". - Well, he's been watching us for a day or so. - Thomas, you sure you've never seen this guy before? - What? - I don't know, it's just weird, that's all. - What's weird? - All this shit going on. The photo, that guy, and where's Kip? You know, everything was going pretty normally until you rolled in. - Um, excuse me, did you forget I just saved all your asses from God knows who? - I'm sorry, saved our asses or brought your other psycho friend into the house with us? And seriously, you said you were a drifter? A drifter, what the fuck is that? - Uh huh. - Yeah. - Okay, fine. You want the truth? - The truth? - Yeah. The truth is... I'm an actor. - An actor? - Yeah. You know, acting, movies and stuff. - Um, have we seen you in anything? - Well, no definitely not, definitely not. And I scored a role in a film as a drifter, and I decided to hitchhike to get into character. - Can you tell us anymore about this film? - Yeah, it's a short film, or independent actually, with an up and comer, Dustin Greenman. - Never heard of him. - Well, he's a senior at NYU Film. - Mhm, okay, so it's a fucking student film. - Yeah, I mean, whatever I can get on my reel helps. - So you decided to go hitchhiking in the middle of nowhere to get in character as a drifter for a student film directed by this Dustin Greenberg? - Greenman. - Mhm, right. - Yeah. And okay, to be honest, I hitched a ride with a truck driver, things got a little weird, and he dropped me off somewhere, I was lost, and you know, method, whatever. And I met you guys and things just seemed better, you know? - What? - So, you gave up on the hitchhiking thing in one day and decided to come party with us instead? - Well, you know, I was gonna start again. - How long were you lost? - Um, a few days, maybe. It's weird out there. You know? God, I swear I was walking in a circle. - Kip. - Yeah, I'm betting on that. - You know what, guys? I think we're safe. That story is way too embarrassing to be made up. - Yeah. - I'm sorry for lying, guys, but I take my craft seriously. - Yeah, no, hey. We get it. - You know what? How about Daniel Day-Lewis and I go out and try to find a gas station tomorrow while you guys hold down the fort until we get back, okay? - Yep, okay. No, come on, you sound like a crazy person, just go down there. Babe, what are you talking about? No, baby, come on, just go down, please. What are you talking about? Wait here. What do you mean now? - Megan? What are you doing? - It's Kip. Kip? He's here? - Yeah. Yeah. Kip, Kip, come on out! - Megan, Kip's not here. Megan, just calm down. He was here, don't look at me like that. He was here, you're looking at me like I'm crazy and I'm not crazy. - No, Meg, it's okay. - He was here! She thinks that Kip was here. - No, I swear, he was here! You're not listening to me. He was! No, no, he was here! - Go to bed, let's go to bed. - He was. - I know, I know. I know. - He was really there, he was talking to me. - Just tell me about it in the morning, okay? There's just been a lot of stress in the house lately. We'll find Kip. I know. I love you. - So, so, we fast forward 20 years, right? And Korsch is a drunk mess. And one day he just vanishes. Still, some of his adopted followers remain, believing Vernon to be some sort of legend, and they take over the cult, renaming it the Hand of God. However, this is where it changes. The land at Paradox Lake is now up for grabs, so a young New York City professor by the name of Daniel Young decides to buy the property and build a summer home. Summer of 1977, the house was built, now called the Eastside House, and Daniel Young began going into the house for very short periods of time. But there, he began to suffer from hallucinations, unwanted thoughts. One year later, in 1978, he killed himself. But, he did leave a journal. Actually, I think I have a copy somewhere. - Megan. - Hey, well done with the map, by the way. - Well, thanks. Yeah, I'm not much of a wilderness guy but, I always think, you know? Better be prepared. - Hey man, sorry again about the whole misleading you guys. You're all really nice, and I'm just trying to get... - Well, that's weird. - What? - According to this, we should have a few more miles to go before we're hitting something. Yeah, let's keep moving. - Who are you? - It's me, Megan. It's me. - No, no, no. That's impossible, no. - My shoulder. Look at my shoulder. - Kip! - I know. - What happened? - And then boom, that's where I come in. Jack Doomhouse. - Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on, hold on. Is that the same sign? - Um... I don't think so. - That doesn't make any sense. We've been walking in a straight line the whole way. Are we walking in a-- - Circle. Huh. - So you're saying we're stuck? - Yup, pretty much. - This is some crazy Twilght Zone, Stephen King, Black Mirror shit. How you doin', Megan? - I'm fine. - What happened? - I want to go check on him, I heard some coughing, and when I opened the door, he was dead. - What the hell? Did he say anything? - I mean, he might've known something about this place, right? - No, no, he didn't say anything. - You won't find anything out here. - Want one? - Sure. So, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. But there's gotta be a way to get out of here, or some way to contact someone. - Yeah, maybe. - I could try this one idea. I saw this thing on TV about survival antennas that you can plug into your smartphone. - Oh. - Yeah, it might not work, but it's worth a shot. Thanks. - Yeah, no problem. Cheers? - Cheers. - Holy shit. Dude, it's so good to see you. Megan, Grace, come down here! Kip, we gotta talk about this place man. It's fucked! - I know. - Kip. - Grace. - Where are your keys? Let's get in your car, and let's go. - About that. - What? - Holy shit! - No. No, wait, no, no, no! You're dead! ¶ You'll want me back one day ¶ No, guys, please! Please let me out, please! Guys! - There's something you should know about Megan, Kip. She's been acting a little-- - Strange. - You think? All right. - So... What the hell happened out there, man? - When I tried to drive back, the car broke down. And then I met a guy who was nice enough to help me, so I started to drive back, and drove around for three hours before I realized it was a circle. - Circle. - Yeah. - 13 hours later, boom. There's the house. - Jesus. - How are you guys? - Well, we're fine but, yeah, we're stuck. - At least we're stuck together. - Kip. You don't know anything about these photographs, do you? - That's weird. - So, no? - No. - Hey, where'd you get the food? - We found it downstairs. - Good job. Goodnight, guys. - Goodnight, man. Guys? Guys? - Okay then. So, Young had a variety of strange writings, from deep ones, to others that, well frankly, sounded like drug induced nonsense. I mean, it was the 70s, but anyway, most of this stemmed from the idea that for every action, there was a new reality created. You see, this house, or rather the property, was sort of an intersection between all these realities. Where familiar yet foreign objects would appear over, and over, and over again for a period of three days. But man, he was really out there. He would claim that upon the end of his three day stay, he would be able to witness his younger self entering the property as he left. - The members of the Hand of God choose to live away from civilization. The general society today is tainted with violence, graphic sexuality. Our own leader consistently threatens nuclear war. We simply want to live in a peaceful world, away from all this chaos. What's so wrong with that? - Sure. Cool, right? - What the fuck, man? Thomas? - Where's Megan? - She's still in her room. - Get away from me! - Megan, do you remember last night? - Yes. Grace, you don't understand. - Guys, check this out. - What's he talking about? Please, I wouldn't! Please, please. - Damn it, I say we get in a car and drive around in circles. Maybe this whole loop thing is over now. - It isn't, I was just out there. - Okay, well, what do we do now? - We'll be fine. We just need to get that body out of there. Too bad we never figured out who this old guy was. - Yeah. Let's get out of here. What are you doing? - I can't quite remember how it goes, but basically, in your smartphone, there's a place to plug in an antenna, and all we need is an antenna, hence the coffee can. So, how you doing with this whole Megan stuff, man? - I think it's still settling in, something about this place. - Yeah, you're telling me. Well, that's weird. I found WiFi. - Really? - Yeah. But it's just a printer network. - Maybe we should just call it. - Yeah, I guess you're right. You know what? Let's just try this, let's just get in the car, drive around, see what happens. - I don't think that's a good idea. - What then? Come on, man. - I'm not sure leaving is in the cards, Tommy. - Megan. Where's Tommy? - Remember I told you how lost I was yesterday? - Yeah. - Well, you weren't the first one to run into that old man. - What? - He told me only one of us could leave. All this shit has already happened, Tommy. And you know how I know that? - Because you were that old man. - This place is weird. All these so called artifacts popping up, the pictures, the voices. What'd you call it? A loop? Right. A loop. This whole place is a loop, Tommy. You want to know what really happened after I left? Well, after driving around in circles for hours, I decided to leave the car, still just as lost. Finally, I figured the best thing I could do was to stay put. That way one of you could come for me, help me, the way I would help one of you. And I stayed there. And I saw things. Then you were gone. You ignored my calls. I finally realized I was alone. And then that's when I met him. He told me that only one of us from each of these so called timelines can make it out, and that it wasn't our time anymore. And then he was gone. I don't know what he told you, but it's gonna be okay, 'cause it's my time. This is my timeline, and I'll be back. So all this will be here repeating itself, over, and over, and over again. - So, what now? You're just gonna kill all of us? - Sorry, babe. - Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh my God! Come on! Shit! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck, oh fuck! - Get out! - Oh fuck, oh fuck! Oh fuck! - Are you okay? - Where are the keys? Where are the keys? - Check the jacket! - I got them! I got them, I found them! - Come on, let's go. Can you go? - Wait. Give me your gun. You guys get the car ready. Go! Okay, okay. - Okay, okay. - Shit! Unlock it! - What? - Unlock it! - Oh! - Unlock this... Oh, God! What is it? - It's not working! Shit! - Fuck! - Where are you gonna go? Pull the trigger. I dare you. Come on. - Come on. Well, can you fix it? - Maybe? But probably not. - He told you, right? Or I told you? - Stop! - Kill me! Kill the others and get out? Well, go ahead. That's what I thought. You're not gonna kill me. Car troubles? What happened to Tommy? You know, I'm glad Megan never found out about us. She would've been devastated. - Kip. Please, you don't have to do this. Oh well. - Boom! That's how it's done. - Oh, fuck. - Well, let's just say it's interesting? You see, all the disappearances over there had just one thing in common. Whoever entered, after three days, only one would return. So, take that for what you will. - Look, Paradox Lake is a rural area deep in the Adirondacks. People go missing. It's sad, it's tragic, but it's part of the wilderness. You gotta respect it, or you're gonna get lost. Right? - I would rather not talk about my own spirituality, just the history. But Young, Young did in fact believe that the house had satanic qualities, and he believed that for each of the timelines as he would put it, only one could return. Hence, that's why he went in alone. You see, he wrote that the house could reach inside of him, and bring out his deepest, darkest motivation. That the house could bring out one's true self. Well, it's... You're a survivor. - As he stood there, steel in his eyes, watching the poor man search desperately for anything to fill his deep, dark soul, finally, he spoke. You won't find anything out here. No. - You won't find anything out here. - Hey. Get in the car. Beer? So, where ya headed? - I don't fuckin' know. Nowhere. You? - Oh, well, there's this small forest near Bryer's Bay, next to Schroon, near Paradox. - You thought I was gonna, I'm gonna-- - No, no, I just... - You're too young for me, kid. - I think I'll-- - Hey! You ain't going in them woods, boy. Not now, not ever. You understand that? Now, you got a name? - It's Thomas. - Name is... Vernon Korsch. That mean anything to you? - No, sorry. I think I'll just-- - Hey, hey, you get back now! One, three. I'm 100 years old, Thomas. She told me she'd make that happen. One, two, three. - You okay? There's no sign of Megan. I say we wait here, and if she's not back in an hour, we'll get in a car and drive, okay? - Thanks. - Yeah. - You know, there ain't no angels down there. Just demons. Them demons, they'll find you. It don't matter who you are though, they'll make their way up to you. Saved? I said you saved? No? Only one. Only one demon... One, two. - Grace? - I'm sorry, but there can only be one, right? - Take it easy. - It's nothing personal, Tommy, okay? - Grace, please. - I am not gonna die here. - Shit! - Fuck! - I'm 100 fuckin' years old. The fuck do I do now? I almost pissed on myself. Well, you sound like a nice boy. I sure would like to keep it that way. Why don't you get back in that car? You know, save the ones you can. The beautiful Adirondacks, so lonely, so peaceful. - Gotta take a piss! On a scale of one to 10, that's a 10, 10. Wait, wait, Tommy, do you have to pee? - Yeah, I have to pee. Why didn't you just say something earlier? - Well, I did man! I've been saying it for miles! Come on, Tommy! No one knew! How much further? - Ladies and gentlemen, here's our turn. - Woo! Oh my God! Thank God, 'cause I have to piss. - Tommy, you have to pee? Do you hear that? Do you think we can make it? - I'm gonna check. Here's your chance to empty your bladders. - What? - Guys! Shit! What the fuck! Hey, what the hell? - Holy shit! Grace, why are you trying to kill us? - Get the fuck out of the car! Oh, fuck! ¶ I know you don't believe ¶ ¶ Another marvelous reason to walk away ¶ - Tommy, I'm sorry, but there can be only one. I can't take any chances. - Please. - I'm really sorry. - Fucking Thomas! - No! Shit! - Fucking assholes! - Megan? - Hey, you. - Hey, hey. How? - You think I'd leave you hanging? I couldn't do it. I'm sorry, I couldn't kill him. - It's okay, it's okay. Let's get out of here. - No. - What? No. - No... Hey, hey. Stay with me. It's okay. We'll figure it out, okay? No. Hey, come on. - Get outta here, Tommy. Stay with me, man. Get out of here. - Megan. Megan, no, wait. Megan. No! Megan, no! - Wow. Just wow. Multiple timelines? I suppose Daniel Young wasn't lying, was he? Wow. So, this film, huh? You want to expose the Hand of-- I want my friends back. - Of course you do. That wasn't everything. - Ugh. What the fuck? - These are your... - Um... So... - It's complicated. - Sorry about your friend. - Thanks. - Sorry, have we met before? - Nah. Name's Tommy. - Thomas. Do you want a beer? - Yeah. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Fuck. ¶ Done messed up bad again ¶ ¶ I've lost another friend ¶ ¶ And you know this ¶ ¶ Yeah, you know this ¶ ¶ And since we both got away ¶ ¶ By two weeks and a day ¶ - Look at that. That's you guys, and I assume those are your friends? Were my friends. - You guys seem like nice kids, I have a lot to get done today so-- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, hold on. Turn the camera off, turn it off. - Oh, what's this? Are these your friends? Were my friends. How do you go back through the Eastside House? - Unfortunately, I don't think I have any information to help you get your friends back, I mean, they may be gone for good. ¶ Sleep when he's around ¶ - But then again, maybe someone else does. ¶ Yeah, I'm trying ¶ ¶ Yeah, I'm trying ¶ - All right, two questions. How the fuck did you find me, Thomas, and what the fuck do you want to know? ¶ And it can hurt ¶ ¶ And you know I feel it too ¶ ¶ If you'd answer me ¶ ¶ I could help you tell the truth ¶ ¶ And it can hurt ¶ ¶ And you know I feel it too ¶ ¶ If you'd answer me ¶ ¶ I will help you tell the truth ¶
