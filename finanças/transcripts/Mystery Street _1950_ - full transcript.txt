[PHONE RINGING] Hello? Yes, operator. I put through the call. All right, I'm waiting. - Hi, Viv. - Hello? This is Vivian. - Mrs. Smerrling. - What? JACKIE: Oh. Rent. For this week and next, okay? Lovely, dear, lovely. I'll get you a receipt. VIVIAN: What do you mean you can't make it? What? All right, I'll hold on. - Lf everyone paid as promptly as you... JACKIE: Thank you, ma'am. Is something wrong, Viv? Nothing I can't handle. Aren't you working tonight, dear? What's it to you? To me, it's cash. Money. - The stuff you owe me two weeks of... - Tomorrow, you'll get it tomorrow. Maybe even with a bonus. Maybe I'll even move out of this place. Maybe into some place with class. Who is he? Do I know him? Go on... - Hello? What? Just a minute. - Tell me. Come on. Anything else? Yeah. Light costs money. All I try to do is help and what happens? I get insulted. VIVIAN: Hello? I couldn't help it. I had to call your house. Please, honey, you got to. I'm in a jam. Listen, you, I'm not interested in your family, I'm interested in me. Now, you meet me tonight. Ten o'clock. Where I work, The Grass Skirt. All right. Be there. So you're out at Hyannis, so it takes two hours from the Cape, so? Make it 10:30. SMERRLING: She's in a jam. Ha. He don't know what a jam he'll be in. Messing with that one. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] WAITER: Not working tonight, honey? DRUMMER: Give her the phone again, Al. Long distance. Honey, can you try Hyannis 3633 for me again, please? It can't still be busy. I've been calling this number since 10:30. Listen, nobody talks that long. Anybody got a yellow Ford parked out front? - Well, would you try it again, please? - Yellow Ford, anybody? Hey, you got a yellow Ford? How about you? - You haven't got a yellow Ford. HENRY: Yeah. AL: You gotta move it, mate, you're parked in the no-parking. HENRY: Hmm? Parked in the no-parking. That's the story of my life. I'm always where I shouldn't be. I'm also not where I ought to be. You know, ever since Adam, man's been crying, "Where am I?" Where are you? Where are you? - Who are you? - I'm with you, honey. [HENRY CHUCKLING] A woman always knows where she is, right? What you need is fresh air. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, open the window, huh? No, not here. Fresh air couldn't get in here with a permit. How about letting me help you move that car of yours, honey? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know, we gotta move that. VIVIAN: How much he owe you, Al? AL: Three-fifty. VIVIAN: We need a bottle. Same thing he's been drinking. You heard her. Same thing I've been drinking. Whatever that is. Where are you? - How much? - Nine bucks all together. Keep the change. Come on, honey. You can't go wrong with this one: Old Ironsides. SAILOR: Can I see that one on your right arm again? Sure thing. - Do you need any help, Miss Heldon? - No, thanks, Jim. I can manage. SAILOR: Yeah, that's the one. - Does it hurt? JIM: Not when you're in the Navy. [CAR HORN HONKING] VIVIAN: Give me the keys. I'll drive. Get in. My wife's in the Boston Lying-in Hospital. - You know where that is? - Sure, sure, sure. You take another drink. Do you good, honey. She lost the baby. She's awful, awful sick, my wife. L... I couldn't take it, I... So I go out and get tight. VIVIAN: Sure, I understand, honey. - Got a couple of nickels? HARRY: Sure. MAN: See you, Harry. HARRY: Okay. Of course I'm coming out to your place. What else do you think I'm doing out here? Well, I am. Well, meet me someplace. - Where? How? - Where is she? All right, goodbye. - Hey, what's the idea? VIVIAN: I forgot something. Well, look. What are we doing out here on the Cape? VIVIAN: Never mind. I'll tell you later. Come on, honey. - Look, you said we were going... - I'll take you back to Boston. - Why did you bring me out here? - Shh. Why did you bring me out here? VIVIAN: Never mind. I'll tell you later. Come on, get in the car. HENRY: Hey, hey, I'll drive. - I'll drive. Get in. Shut the door. Hey, where are you taking me? I told you, I gotta get back to the hospital, back to Boston. - Hey, take it easy. - You drive. - I didn't mean... - You don't like the way I drive? You drive. Hey. Hello, big shot. Start explaining. Nothing to say? Go on, make a speech. You're pretty good at that. You're pretty good at everything, except paying off, aren't you? Don't think you're gonna walk out on me. Not now. It isn't as easy as that. Well? Well, say something! [HORN HONKS] [CAR APPROACHING] [MAN WOLF-WHISTLES] [REVVING ENGINE] Sign here. HENRY: All right, sir. Next time I park in front of a hospital, I'll take the keys with me. Here's your check, Mr. Shanway. All right. Thank you very much. I could sure use this. Ninety days is a long time to wait for your money... ...but with stolen-car claims, we have to do it. - I understand. Thank you very much, sir. - You're quite welcome. I saw them. Bones. Nothing but bones. - Human bones, they say. - Just a drowned fisherman washed up. Then he must have been fishing naked. - Is the constable still here? WOMAN: Yes. [RINGS DOORBELL] FISCHER: Come in. REPORTER: Hello, constable, thanks for the tip. Well, I was following the flight of the sandpipers on the beach... ...when suddenly I saw this... This... It. In the brush. - I could hardly believe my eyes. - What were you doing on the beach? Studying the mating habits of the sandpiper. As an ornithologist... Do you know what that is? Oh. Kind of a peeping Tom? Birds, fellow. [PHONE RINGING] The study of birds. I was watching this particular pair of sandpipers, when this... PHOTOGRAPHER: Would you mind looking through those binoculars? FISCHER: Constable Fischer. - At what? FISCHER: Just a minute. - It's for you, Pete. It's the district attorney. PETER: Oh, thank you. Moralas. Yes, I did, Mr. Simmons. Did you get the information I radioed in? Well, that's all there is, sir. No, no clothes. No jewelry, nothing. Just the bones. What laboratory? I don't mean to be disrespectful, sir, but what can Harvard University possibly...? Oh, I see. No, I haven't. Right. Yes, sir. Goodbye. How do you think he was murdered, lieutenant? Who said it was murder? And who said it was a he? - The district attorney wants your deposition. - All right. You keep that area roped off until our men get through. FISCHER: Okay. REPORTER: Look, lieutenant, how about some facts? Facts? Bones. Print that. Let's go. - See you later, constable. FISCHER: Okay. SHARKEY: Well, here we are. Pardon me, where is the Department of Legal Medicine? - Do you know, Rip? - No. No, sorry. Thanks. Harvard. Well, this certainly isn't it. Pardon me, fellas. Which way to the Department of Legal Medicine? STUDENT: I guess you want the law school. Go out the main gate, then turn right a couple of blocks. Thanks. Back to the main gate. That's where we started. Pardon me. Could you tell me where the Department of Legal Medicine is? - Oh, that's in the medical school. - Far from here? It's about five miles, over in Roxbury. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I thought I was the stranger around here. This ain't my part of Boston, lieutenant. Oh, sorry to keep you waiting. - Lieutenant Moralas? - Yes, sir. - I'm McAdoo. - How do you do, doctor? I understand you have something to show me. Yes, I have. This is Detective Sharkey. - Sharkey. - Doctor. And this is all you've got to go on. Uh-huh. - Got it solved already? - Oh, it'll take a few days at least. What are the facts? Identification, none. Fingerprints, none. Weapon, none. We don't know if it's a man or woman, suicide, murder, accident, or natural causes. What about a starting point? Where was it found? I'm sorry. At a place called Lakeman's Hollow. It is all we know. "Two p.m., September 6th, the bones of this unidentified person or persons... ...were found in the low bushes, 100 yards north of Lakeman's Hollow... Barnstable. Right here... Massachusetts." That was an out-of-state case. Jackson affair. Heard of it? PETER: No. - Interesting case. Husband and wife in a violent quarrel, neighbors heard it. Woman found dead on the kitchen floor in a puddle of blood. Did they nail him? McADOO: He was walking out of the house and out on her. She wrecked the room in a rage of jealousy. He was convicted of second-degree murder. Six months later, we were called in on the case. Our autopsy proved that she died of apoplexy... ...at almost the exact moment the husband was buying a bus ticket. - Saved that husband a little trouble. SHARKEY: You sure did. PETER: A little trouble? Hm. Say, but what about the puddle of blood? Oh, uh, when she collapsed, she bumped her nose. Nosebleed. I'll get this case started. - Say, doctor. - Yeah? - What's this? - Man's head was split wide open. It wasn't murder either. It certainly wasn't apoplexy. McADOO: Believe it or not, he did it himself. On purpose. [PHONE RINGING] KILRAIN: What is your name, please, madam? Address? [PHONE RINGING] How long ago did this happen? Just a second. SHARKEY: Sorry. - Kilrain. Maple? This is the Boston Detective Bureau, mister. Open the door, would you, Garrity? KILRAIN: We'll send someone right up, Mr. Charles. Please don't touch anything. Run this down, will you, Garrity? Says a man came to fix her phone. She got suspicious because he wasn't wearing any pants. Oh, Moralas, this is O'Hara. - How are you? O'HARA: How do you do? Cape Cod skeleton case. He'll be with us a while. Been over to see McAdoo yet? Do you know around 300,000...? People die every year in this country from unexplained causes. He's met McAdoo all right. It's because only eight states require coroners to be doctors. Maybe they figure doctors can't help when you're dead. No, I don't know. Doctors like McAdoo can help plenty. I saw murders that turned out to be suicides. Suicides that were accidents, and accidents that paid off in murder. - McAdoo say yours is murder? - I think it is. Take it easy. Ever been on a murder case before? Not exactly. Up in the Portuguese district where I'm assigned, it's mostly small stuff. [PHONE RINGS] - Excuse me. - Let's unwind, lieutenant. - You had dinner yet? - Nope. KILRAIN: When do you see McAdoo again? PETER: First thing tomorrow morning. McADOO: Can you see it all right? - Got it? PETER: Mm. McADOO: Now, those are from your case. Human hairs under low magnification. PETER: They're darker at one end, aren't they? Mm-hm. Dark end natural, white end bleached. - That makes it a blond. - Or the murderer was a blond. - Then it was murder. - Lf it was murder. - So far, we've got blond hair. - Mm-hm. Now, those leaves you brought in: Cape flora, low blueberry, poison ivy. Here's the poison ivy. Now, these plants stopped growing the day the body covered them. They're almost in full leaf, the size they should be the end of May. - Then we know the date of the murder. - Well, not necessarily. Suppose the body had been dead when brought there. - Lf it had been brought there. - Then, what have we got? Rough working date. Say, the week of May 20th. MAN: Your skeleton, lieutenant. McADOO: Oh, yes. By the way, Pete, you'll have to go back and look for some more bones... ...and sift the sand to a depth of at least a foot. - What for? - She's not all here. - She? - Oh, yes, definitely a lady. That was easy. For example, let's take a look at John. You'll notice that, like most men... ...his head size is larger in proportion to the rest of his body. He also has a little more jaw. A woman's bones, on the other hand, are lighter, smaller... ...and with less pronounced muscular attachments. I suppose you'd like to know her age. I'd also like to know her height, weight, occupation... ...and the name and number of the person who murdered her. We can answer all those questions except the last. - Age? - Between 20 and 24. - Probably closer to 24. - That's only a guess, of course. Oh, not really. You see, it isn't until you reach the age of 25 that all the bones get really solid. She's just about completed that process. Now, this is the last long bone to fuse into one piece. As you can see, it's almost closed. - Um, occupation? Maybe? McADOO: What people do often marks them. Sometimes psychologically, sometimes physically. Uh, let's take this foot. When this bone is this heavy, it makes me think she was a toe dancer. Now, as to height, there are several ways. The application of Pearson's Formula to this thighbone... ...would indicate she was about 65 inches tall. How was she killed, doctor? Haven't figured that out yet. - Here's a preliminary report, lieutenant. - Oh, thank you. "A woman, bleached blond, about 24, about 5'5"... ...died in or about the week of May 20th, probably once a toe dancer." - Thank you, doctor. McADOO: It's all right. You've gotta find a face to put on that skull. Is that all? You'll probably find not over 1000 girls missing on that day. - Approximately. - Approximately. - Goodbye. - Bye. Four from Connecticut. Two from Vermont. Twelve from Massachusetts. Six from New Jersey. Two from Maine. A hundred and twenty-six from New York. - What do you think makes them do it? - Do what? I wish I knew. Then I'd tell my wife, and maybe she'd disappear. Hey, this one's not bad. Now, for the picture that fits her skull. - Look, these pictures are all different sizes. - That's right. But all we've gotta do is find out how the photographs were made. The camera used, the exposure, the focus... ...what kind of film, what kind of paper it was printed on... ...the distance from the camera, and then match it. Look, who says this can even be done? McAdoo. It was done once in Scotland. Ha-ha. Lieutenant, you're not young enough to start on this case. Maybe. But I'm dumb enough. McADOO: No. The eye sockets are too wide apart... ...and the forehead's too prominent for this face. - How many do we have left? - About eight, sir. - May be none of them, you know. - That's encouraging. No, the jaw of the skull's too short for this girl. PETER: Well, it wasn't a bad idea. It was a good idea. If the skull fits, it may not prove you have the right girl... ...but if it doesn't fit, it certainly eliminates the wrong one. Hmm. Close. How about it, doctor? Fairly close. - What number is this, Ben? BEN: That's Negative Number 3, sir. McADOO: Mm-hm. Length and width's all right. Eye sockets, good. Teeth, perfect. I'd say this could be the girl. That's good enough for me. "Heldon, Vivian. Twenty-four, 5'5", reported missing by Jacqueline Elcott... ...May 30th, 317 Bunker Street, Boston." We check on it. I'll call you later, doctor. Thank you. [RINGING DOORBELL] SMERRLING: Yes? - Yes? - Good afternoon. I'm looking for a lady. - Yes, indeed. - By the name of Jacqueline Elcott? Why, she's asleep. Works nights, you know. - Sweet, very sweet. - Yes, but l... - Who shall I say called? - Will you just call her now, please? Of course. I'm hardly responsible for what my room... - Just call her. - Yes, indeed. Oh, Jackie. - Jackie? JACKIE: Yeah, Mrs. S? Better come down. It's a... It's a gentleman caller named Dick. JACKIE: Be right down. Now, if you'll excuse me. PETER: Who are you? I'm Mrs. Smerrling. I own this rooming house and I've never had any trouble. Whatever it is that Jackie has done... Not that she would do anything, mind you. Is your husband here? Not exactly. Were you ever married? Not exactly. I... I, uh... - You see, l... - Vivian Heldon. She roomed here. Now, there's a bad one. Is she in jail? What for? - Miss Elcott? - Yes. Oh, I'm Lieutenant Moralas. You reported Vivian Heldon missing. Oh, yes, sir. When she didn't come back after a couple of days, I got scared. I don't know why, but I did. Then I checked where she works and... PETER: Where was that? - The Grass Skirt, a caf?. They said she went out one night with a customer and never came back. I pity the customer. About a week later... ...I got a picture from her room and sent it to the police. SMERRLING: You should have consulted me. - Are her things still here? Well, all I found was her suitcase. I put it in my room. Let's have a look at it, huh? Excuse me. If there's any money in it, she owes me two weeks' rent. Thank you, Mrs. Smerrling. JACKIE: Nothing happened to her, did it? Why do you think something happened? Oh, I don't know. Excuse the way it looks, please. PETER: What's in it? - How should I know? Sorry. JACKIE: Girls like us, Vivian and me... ...mostly there's nobody to look out for us. Like a family, I mean. And Vivian was always saying... ...is how any day, she was gonna be set. And I don't know why, but I got scared. - That Harvard. - What? Nothing. Did you find Vivian? Yes. Might as well come in, Mrs. Smerrling. After all, it is my house. The rest of Miss Heldon's belongings, where are they? I have no idea. Why not ask her? What happened to Vivian? Please, tell me. - You sold her things, didn't you? - I beg your pardon? - Didn't you? - Well... That can land you in jail, you know. Well, after all, she did owe me two weeks' rent. She's dead. She is, isn't she? PETER: Yes. How did it happen? Where? On Cape Cod. Near Hyannis. We don't know how as yet. Excuse me. SMERRLING: Poor gal. Poor, poor gal. If there's anything I can do... I want a list of everything you sold and where you sold it. Of course. Well, that is, if I can remember. My memory, you know, isn't exactly my number one asset. Well, pull your assets together. I want the truth. We'll get in touch with you later. Goodbye. "Hyannis 3633." SMERRLING: I just love boats. They're so manly. And there's so many of them. Gracious, they must cost a dreadful lot. I would say it pays to be rich. Oh, my, what a lovely office. - So you design the boats. - Yes. Madam, won't you sit down? Well, poor Vivian's gone now. You know, she used to tell me all her secrets. We were very close, Vivian and I. Sort of a mother and daughter. And I thought... HARKLEY: Thought what? Well, it's not an easy subject, now, is it? I'm very busy, madam. What was it you wanted? [KNOCKS] - Excuse me, Mr. Harkley. HARKLEY: Yeah, later. But the man with the main mast is here. He must have the papers, please. Will you, uh? - Excuse me. - Of course. SMERRLING: My, what a lovely girl. Yes. SMERRLING: It certainly is a busy business. Madam, the bus leaves in about 10 minutes. - But... - one of my truck drivers... ...can take you back to town. - Truck driver? Oh, really, Mr. Harkley. I'm a poor woman, but that's no need to insult me. After all, Vivian ought to have a decent burial. And who's going to take care of the expenses? No friends, no one who wants to be reminded. Only me... ...her only friend in life and death. How am I going to afford it? I ask you, how? You're talking about this Vivian. That's right. I never knew the girl. Oh, come now, Mr. Harkley. Your telephone number is Hyannis 3633, isn't it? I never forget a number. Not that I listen to people's conversations... ...but you know how it is, don't you? What do you want? Only a few dollars. After all, I know that you've got a family, Mr. Harkley. And that you're a very respectable man. Don't you think I know that? You know the penalty for blackmail? Really, Mr. Harkley. The idea of blackmail for just a few dollars? Don't be silly. Ha-ha-ha! Get out. I said, get out. Poor Vivian. Without a grave to call her own. Perhaps she's listening to us right now. Goodbye, Mr. Harkley. She must have been with four or five customers that night. Like every night. But she left with only one of them. What did he look like? She call him by name? Just "honey." Everybody was "honey." How did she meet him? Did he ask for her? All I remember is the parking fella come in and ask, "Who owns a yellow Ford?" I asked the customers along the bar, right down the line. The guy with Vivian, he says, "That's my car." I says, "You'll have to move it." Vivian says they'll take care of it. They leave. - Then what? - Well, I guess they left. He pay his check? Yeah. Because when they left, I sold him a bottle. I remember that because it's against the law to sell bottled goods. PETER: Relax. Excuse me. So long. I can't say that I do. No, sir, I'm... PETER: Your name is in her book. Perhaps she had me in mind for some professional work... ...as a mortician. Would you remember her face? Well, I don't know. I see so many faces. Oh, of course, that's Vivian. Miss Heldon. Yes, I remember now. She rather reminded me of my late wife. We did meet once or twice. - Where? - Where she works. Where else? Well, in my car once. What kind of car? One of my limousines. When did you see her last? Over a year ago. May 23rd, do you know where you were? May 23rd. I left the middle of May for a mortician's convention in Atlantic City. You know, exchange of ideas, floral displays. - Wonderful. PETER: Mm-hm. Yes. When did you return? I came back the first week in June. Pardon me if I ask, where is our mutual friend at present? - She's dead. - I see. But then, we must not despair. Passing away is part of the scheme of things. Life and death, death and life... ...and who are we to say? By the way, who is handling the, uh? - Harvard Medical School. - Oh. Thank you. Yes, she was a patient. Came here the morning of May the 23rd. Mrs. Vivian Heldon, 317 Bunker Street. - That's the one. - She never returned. Probably intends on going to some other physician to have her baby. What? Mrs. Heldon should have her child sometime in December. May I see that, doctor, please? KILRAIN: Hello, Pete. How's it going? Well, we got a motive. Maybe. Here's the list of stolen cars. You know how many cars were stolen that week throughout the country? - One thousand eight hundred and eight-six. - They can't all have been yellow Fords. [YAWNING] A hundred and twenty-six in New England. What's the matter? Kind of beat? That girl had a lot of friends in that little black book. Here. Take a look at this. Watch them take to the hills now. Twenty-four in Boston. Say, one was a yellow Ford. "Reported stolen May 24th. 117 Bradford." - Get the rest of the dope, will you? - Sure, sure. [WHISTLING] GRACE: Darling... ...supper's ready. Oh, all right. [DOORBELL RINGING] GRACE: Hello. PETER: Good evening. Is Mr. Shanway in? GRACE: Yes. PETER: I'm from the police. - Mr. Shanway reported a car stolen. - Oh, yes, of course. Come in. - Thank you. - Henry, this man's from the police. It's about our car. This is my husband. Lieutenant Moralas. I'm sorry to bother you, just a routine check. - Of course. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. Excuse me. - Would you like a cup of coffee? - Don't trouble yourself. No trouble at all. Funny, uh, you finding the car. After our claim's been paid, I mean. We're about to buy a new one. - It hasn't been found. - Oh? Where was it stolen from, Mr. Shanway? - Well, I was at the Boston Lying-In Hospital. - Thank you. Visiting me. Car was parked outside. That's the last I saw of it. - Sugar? - Please. When was it stolen? May 23rd, at night. It was the night Grace lost her baby. When were you in the hospital? - I told you when... - I asked Mrs. Shanway. The end of May, early part of June. I told you. What's the trouble, officer? Do you know a Miss Vivian Heldon? Who? The girl whose picture's in the paper. You've seen it, haven't you, Mr. Shanway? She disappeared May 23rd. Oh, yes. Yes, I did see it. I didn't think of her name, that's all. Besides, what's it gotta do with me? She left her place of work with a man. In a yellow Ford. Well, lots of yellow Fords around. Only one was stolen that week. - Maybe the one she was in wasn't stolen. - That's right. Maybe it wasn't. Thanks for the coffee. You're very kind. HENRY: I swear, I never saw... - You don't have to swear. Where do you work, Mr. Shanway? I'm a dispatcher at the depot. Well, good night. As I said, I'm sorry to bother you. Good night. Oh, by the way... ...how did you get home from the hospital? L... I walked. It was very late, so I walked. - Good night. - Good night. Did you ever know her? HENRY: No. Why are you so upset? Oh, well, he has no right coming in here and accusing people like that. It's just his job. Well, I was just thinking of my job. I mean, how's it gonna look if it gets in the papers and everything? But you didn't know her, did you? No, darling, no. No, what I want is this: When Mrs. Henry Shanway was admitted to your hospital... ...and when she was discharged. All right, I'll hold on. - Hello, professor. - Hello, Pete. That sand sifting you fellas did paid off pretty well. We found the missing bones, all right. One of the ribs was cracked. - Don't know what to make of that yet. - Hmm. - Did you know there were extra bones? - Why, no. Mm-hm. Thought they might give you a motive. Proved to be from an unborn child. My guess is about three months. I was going to... Yes? I see, nurse. Thank you. I was going to tell you the same news. - How did you know? - Undergraduate work. Professors work with their heads, cops work with their feet. See this little book? Eighty-six names. Almost all of them men. One of them is a murderer. It's a long shot, Pete. I'd say murder. Yeah? Lieutenant, Mr. Black's here. He says he hangs outside the Grass Skirt. PETER: Come in, Mr. Black. This is Dr. McAdoo. McADOO: I'll wait outside, Pete. - My business ain't private. Did you find him? - Did you find him? - Sit down, Mr. Black. I don't wanna sit down. I've been looking for you ever since her picture was in the... Listen, I've been to the police. Fifty places, maybe, till they tipped me right. So I'm here. So I wanna know, did you find him? You told the policemen you work outside the... I'm a tattooist. I work the same place she worked. I saw her leave that night with a man. They drove away in a car and she never came back. He killed her. Now I wanna know, did you find him? - Would you know him if we found him? - I'd know him. I'll never forget him. What did he look like? Like a million other guys, but you show him to me and I'll know him. You might not find it so easy. She went with a lot of men. Miss Heldon was a good girl. A fine person. When she didn't come back, I thought maybe she had a new job. How well did you know her? You cops. Always suspicious. Know her? Sure, I knew her. I was never close enough to smell her perfume... ...but I knew her. I'd have been willing to do anything for Miss Heldon. She was beautiful. She was sweet. Always a nice word to me. Find that guy. I'll know him. You find him and show him to me... ...and I'll cram him into the electric chair for you. Anytime you need me, I'll be around. [PHONE RINGS] Lieutenant Moralas. Who? All right, put him on. You know, he was probably the only real friend Miss Heldon had. Yes? I know, I know, but since her picture has been in the paper... ...five thousand people think they saw her that night. Where? Cape Cod? What's the exact address of your diner, Mr. Jasper? Will you be there this afternoon? You won't leave? Fine. Want to come along? McADOO: All right. Where's Sharkey? He's down on the Cape. We're dragging every freshwater pond around Lakeman's Hollow... ...to see what we can find. McADOO: Good idea. I thought so. Let's go, huh? - Well, thank you, Mr. Jasper. - You're welcome. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. At least we got her this close to the scene of the crime. Six miles. That's about all. Those guys must have been busy looking at the girl... ...they didn't even see the man. - They'd know if he was quarreling with her. - Yeah, she was calling him "honey." I wonder if that meant she liked you. [CAR HORN HONKING] PETER: Find anything? - I was coming into Boston to see you. - They struck metal. They're grappling for it. - Good, let's go. MAN 1: Take the line up. MAN 2: Okay. Going up. MAN 1: Hi, Pete. "83498." Shanway. There's probably more stuff in there. - Park it in the county garage. MAN 1: Okay, Pete. That Shanway said his car was stolen from in front of a hospital. Maybe somebody stole it for this purpose. - Anyway, Pete, you better make sure. - I'll make sure. OFFICER: The two men with the hats... ...take them off. Now, all of you, turn around. All the way around. Face the wall. Now, turn to the front again. The two men nearest the door, you can leave. The man on the far side, go out the way you come in. You say you've never been in the Grass Skirt Caf?? That's right. OFFICER: And never went for a ride with Vivian Heldon? That's right. OFFICER: You didn't stop at a lunch counter on the Cape? - I didn't go out on the Cape. OFFICER: Stand still. Turn your face to the right. Turn it to the left. Now go out the way you came in. - That's him, I'll swear that's him. - He's lying. - He's the one. PETER: All right, hold it. - May I? OFFICER: Go ahead, lieutenant. Are you all sure, now? JACKIE: I never saw him before. - You were asleep, dear. The twice he came to the house you were asleep. PETER: How many times did he call for Miss Heldon? SMERRLING: Exactly twice. PETER: She left with him each time? No, no, this was after she disappeared. After? Why, yes. He came to ask about Vivian, whether she was back. But you didn't mention it. Why? Well, I didn't... Well, you know how nervous the police make everybody. - Especially timid people like yourself. SMERRLING: Thank you. You... PETER: Save it. Take them in there for statements. GRACE: Lieutenant. Lieutenant, please. Just a second, please. Those people... There must be some mistake. They must be wrong. Why, Henry couldn't have... You heard what they said, Mrs. Shanway. No doubt in any of their minds. I'm sorry. After you left the diner, you took her out to Cape. Why? - I didn't. - You took her to kill her. She wouldn't leave you alone because she was pregnant. You were afraid your wife would find out, there was only one way to keep her quiet. - I didn't. - You stripped the body... ...threw it behind some bushes, then got rid of your car. She took my car. I thought you didn't know who took your car. That landlady says you went back to the house. The house where Vivian lived. You asked for Vivian... ...said you were an old friend from out of town. But you didn't know who Vivian was... ...so how did you know where she lived? - I asked the bartender at that bar. PETER: Mm-hm. Well, I just wanted my car back. I didn't know Vivian was... Vivian, huh? Before, you didn't know her. - Suddenly it's Vivian. - That's what you called her, so... You went back there to establish an alibi. No, to get my car. Mr. Shanway, this isn't a trial. I'm not determining whether you're guilty or innocent. As a police officer, I'm only trying to get the facts. Now, you may or may not be telling the truth. I don't know. But it is my duty to stay here until I find out. Now, tell me the whole thing from the beginning. - Where's my wife? - You'll get a chance to explain to her later. You left the hospital about 9:00. All right. She picked me up. I went with her. We were at that lunch counter... ...but I didn't kill her. She left me stranded on the road. She left me stranded! All right, all right. Let's put it down. We're at the hospital... BEN: Hi, lieutenant. - Hello, Dr. Levy. How are you? - Hi. - Hello, Pete. Well, doctor, we indicted Henry Shanway. So I've heard. The first time you came to this office... ...I told you our department is interested in facts. Whom those facts affect, whether they mean guilt or innocence, is your job. It'd be tough. Mighty tough. There's something you ought to know. Remember that cracked rib I told you about? Yes. It was broken by a bullet. - Why didn't you say so before? - Spectrographic report just came through. But our case is on the calendar for next week. Bits of metal scraped from the broken edges of the rib proved to be from a bullet. All right. - So he shot her. - Who shot her? - Shanway. - Why are you so certain he shot her? - Who else? - Where's the gun? Where's the bullet? We've got enough on him without that. Who are you trying to convince? You or me? Now, Shanway and Miss Heldon left the caf? at 11 p.m. Somewhere between the lunch counter and Lakeman's Hollow... ...she was shot and killed. Great. That's just great. Where was she shot? In the car? Out of the car? Four months ago, a bullet is fired somewhere between Boston and Barnstable. A needle in a haystack. McADOO: Where's the yellow Ford? In the county garage. Why? - Ever see an autopsy? - No, not exactly my line. I think I'll show you one. I've got a theory. Come on. - Hi, Charlie. Ed. CHARLIE: Hi, Pete. Suppose you get in behind the wheel, huh? Hey, that's pretty dirty. Here, you better use this. Let's imagine you're Vivian Heldon and Henry Shanway's story is true. Now, you make a phone call from the lunch wagon to meet somebody. Then get in the car and drive off and leave Shanway standing there. In the five or six miles beyond the lunch wagon, you meet that person. That's me. I come around the car to talk to you here. See, sit up this way the way she did. Now, while you're talking, I take the gun from my pocket and fire it. The bullet enters here, passes through the body... ...shatters the rib and, from this angle, must have entered the car about there. There is a little soft spot here. Could be a bullet hole. McADOO: Uh-huh. Yeah, probably the water swelled it shut. Hop out of the car. McADOO: Thank you. Now, let's see. Yep, there's a hole, all right. Here, hold the light, will you? Come down on this angle iron here. Here it is. - It could still be Shanway. - Yeah, it could be. Until you find the gun that fits that bullet and whoever fired it, you won't have proof. Suppose Shanway is telling the truth. Suppose the actual murderer goes free. - It's a.45 caliber, isn't it? - Uh-huh. Might be an automatic. - Colt? - We'll check it. I'll check it against the lead we got off the girl's rib. Thanks a lot, fellas. I didn't know you were moving. Now you know. Lucky we dropped around. Depends on how you look at it. Any other questions? Why are you moving? You wanna pay the rent? We'll stay here. No? Come, come, lieutenant... ...don't tell me such things as rent never entered your mind. Better wait, the law might wanna see if there's a hidden drawer in that. Wouldn't you, lieutenant? Or was this a social visit? There are a couple of things I didn't look into. Oh? My past, perhaps. I had measles and whooping cough. A couple of tickets for parking in no-parking zones. Honeymoon in Niagara Falls. I stole a towel from the hotel there. Maybe you'd like to arrest me too. No? Maybe my husband's mother then. She comes from Kansas... ...that's where they raise wheat. I'm sure there must be a law against that somewhere. Your husband said he didn't own a gun. He was lying, of course. In any case, I will have to search the apartment. Why, certainly, lieutenant. Why don't you rip open the mattress? I'm sure there's a gun there somewhere. Grace, please. Your husband had a checking account? What are we looking for, lieutenant? A check to Vivian Heldon, perhaps? I would like to see the canceled check for the month of May. - Lieutenant... - Never mind, Mother. We must respect the law, you know? May 4th: Six dollars for a maternity dress. May 15th: 9.35 for groceries. There was a bottle of sherry in that order. May 18th: Fourteen dollars for infants' wear. Never used. Never can be used. May 29th: 14... Forty-eight dollars on the hospital bill. Wait, lieutenant, there's still two checks left. [GRACE SOBBING] - We're on the calendar for next week. - Mr. Simmons, is Henry Shanway here? - Yes. - When do we get to see him? REPORTER 1: How about an interview? - Don't hurry us, boys. - We'll arrange those things all in good time. REPORTER 2: How'd you nail him? - What were the clues? - Ask Harvard. Thank you. Come on in, Pete. Gives us a break, boys. We'll see you later. REPORTERS: All right. Been with those boys for 10 minutes. Well, we're off to the races. Both of us. What's the matter? There are a couple of things I'm not sure about. - But you're sure Shanway did it. - Yeah, yeah. - Trial's booked for next week. - Yes. You sound like you're sorry for him. He's a murderer. He'll have to take what's coming. Yeah, so will his wife. SIMMONS: Just give me a minute in my office, fellas. REPORTER 1: Are you Mrs. Shanway? PHOTOGRAPHER: Could you hold it, Mrs. Shanway? Look up as if you were seeing your husband. REPORTER 2: Are you gonna stand by your husband? REPORTER 3: Is your husband in love with Vivian Heldon? PHOTOGRAPHER: Please take off your hat, Mrs. Shanway. REPORTER 2: Our readers... - Will you please leave me alone? PETER: Fellas, that's enough for now. You'll get a chance to talk to her later. Is there anything I can do for you, Mrs. Shanway? - I know how you feel. - Do you? What makes you so sure he didn't do it? - He couldn't do it. - Yes, he could. He could make a date with a woman. He could get drunk with her. He could take her riding in his car. All while you were in the hospital. That officer will take care of you. Is this for Mr. Shanway? HENRY: I'm sorry. How's everything? Fine. Everything will be fine. - Did you see Mr. Beckett? - Oh, well... Well, I checked about him, darling... ...and people say he's really not a very good lawyer. But did you see him? Yes. We don't have enough money for him, do we? Darling? Yes? About that girl. Did you? Well, you know I didn't kill her. I didn't mean that. Oh, no, darling. No, I didn't. I made a mistake. I made lots of mistakes, but not that one. PETER: Pull out. O'HARA: Hi, Pete. PETER: Hi. O'HARA: Still knocking down walls, huh? - Still trying. KILRAIN: How about a game? - No, thanks, I was just working out. KILRAIN: I thought your case was closed. - So did I. O'HARA: I gotta hand it to you, you're sure right about the murder part. KILRAIN: Right about the murderer too. Know you're getting fatter every day? O'HARA: Can still beat you. KILRAIN: They say the bigger you are, the harder you fall. Ever see a cop who wasn't sure? - Yeah, you. - Yeah. At this stage of the game? I thought we were looking for a gun. "Bermil. Webson. Delwin. Judby. Harkley, James Joshua." HARKLEY: Morning. - Mr. Harkley. - Yes? I'm from the Barnstable district attorney's office. One of my hunkies in trouble again? All kinds of people have trouble, Mr. Harkley. You run along home. We'll have that ride tomorrow. - I can't wait, Dad. - Don't. Tomorrow. - Tell Mother I'll be home early. GIRL: Okay, Dad. - Let's go in and talk, huh? - What about? - Vivian Heldon. - Who? Oh, you mean the skeleton girl. Yes, that's right. - How well did you know her? - I didn't know her at all. I never heard of her till I read about her in the papers. On the seventh of this month, around 4:30 in the afternoon... ...a phone call was made from 317 Bunker Street to Hyannis 3633... ...your home phone. Who was it? - Well, lots of people call my home. - From 317 Bunker Street? - I'm afraid I don't... - That's where Vivian Heldon lived. Let me get this straight. Are you accusing...? I'm only asking about a phone call, that's all. I'm never at home at 4:30 in the afternoon. You own a pistol: .45-caliber Colt automatic. Sorry, I'd like to oblige, but sorry... The United States Army charged you out with such a weapon. - So? - So I'd like to see it. Is that how the girl was killed? Forty-five? The papers say she was choked to death. The Army records show you never returned your gun. I turned it in. Oh, yes, it was France. Yes, Metz. PETER: Oh, I see. You don't mind if I take a quick look around? I certainly do mind. - Since when can a cop break in...? - I brought a search warrant. HARKLEY: Look, when I say I haven't got a gun, I haven't got one. My word is as good as an affidavit. If you wanna know about me, ask anybody. There was a Harkley around these parts before there was a U.S.A. You can ask anybody. But from the way you talk, you haven't been around here long. You see that girl before? My daughter. I've got two more. One older, one younger. The older one starts at Bryn Mawr next year. The key, please. Thank you. Look, I told you. I haven't got a gun. I know you told me, Mr. Harkley. No gun. I suppose you wanna search my home now. Already been there. You know, I'm used to respect. - People looking up to me. - So am I, Mr. Harkley. And my family hasn't been in this country for even 100 years. Goodbye. Oh, Jackie, I was just coming up to see you. I'm late for work now. Look what I found. I was looking in Mr. Pendor's trunk... You remember, my late roomer, the Shakespearean actor. - No. - And this was in his trunk. I thought Shakespeare actors used spears. - What sort of a gun do you think it is? - Forty-five-caliber automatic. Oh, it might be dangerous. Do you think it's loaded? Not anymore. I used to go with an MP. What I learned about guns and the Marines. - Bye. - You're so clever, dear. I'm sorry to bother you again. I thought if you'd try to remember... Please, Mrs. Shanway. I told you everything I know. I told you. I told the police. I told the grand jury. Why don't you let me alone? But they're going to let my husband take the blame. You've got to help. [BELL RINGS] Miss Elcott... ...do you suppose Mrs. Smerrling might? Oh, sure. Why don't you go and have a talk with her. You never can tell what that old witch is thinking. I wish I could help you. Honest. But who am I? All right, I don't think your husband did it. I told that to the police. So, what good did it do? Now they say he shot her. Please, Mrs. Shanway, please don't make trouble for me. I might lose my job. I'm sorry. Really, I am. Please go away, please. Operator? I want Lieutenant Moralas... ...in the Barnstable Police Department, Cape Cod. It's important. [DOORBELL RINGING] [BIRD CHIRPING] [KNOCKS] SMERRLING: Just a minute. Good evening, Mr. Harkley. [BIRD CHIRPING] Don't be frightened, Caesar, it's only a man. I haven't entertained a gentleman in ever so long. HARKLEY: A mirror? - Yes, when Caesar's wife died... ...I thought of the mirror. And now he's perfectly happy talking to himself. Well, you might offer me a drink. You mean hard liquor? Oh, really, Mr. Harkley. I never touch the stuff. Forget it. I always say there's too much drinking in the world today. Gracious. This must have been left here by a previous tenant. - Go ahead. - Oh, no, no. Really, I never... oh, well, if you insist. My, invigorating, isn't it? Well, they always say, "one swallow never makes the summer." [LAUGHING] Why did you take the gun from my place? Dear boy, it frightened me. People who are scared of guns leave them alone. Well, this one kind of stuck to my fingers, you know... ...and you looked so foreboding and dangerous. And what with the touchy things I was going to ask you... ...I thought the gun might go off. Accidentally, I mean. - And when you took it, you didn't know? - That it was what killed Vivian? Dear me, no. - Killing Vivian was an accident. - Yes, I know, dear. Lots of people have accidents all the time. - Why, just today the paper had statistics... - Where is it? - I beg your pardon? - The gun. Where is it? Gently... Gently, dear boy. This gin cost $4 a bottle. I said, where is it? Really, Mr. Harkley... ...you don't think I'd leave it around here, do you? Not such a valuable trinket as that gun. Not when the police want it as much as they do. Not when you want it as much as you do. Not when it's worth so much to me. Suppose somebody else finds it before we do. - Impossible, dear boy. - Why? Because nobody knows where I put it. Here, count it and let's go. - There's 500. - Oh, dear. I'm afraid you don't think nearly enough of your own life. - How much? - Oh, I really don't know. You see, I had been planning on a trip to Europe. After the trial, of course. You know, London, Paris and Rome. You've been to those places, Mr. Harkley. How much does it cost? You're crazy. SMERRLING: And then there's Vienna and Madrid. When I get back, I'd like to spend the rest of my days in a little apartment in New York. Nothing lavish, you understand, but adequate. I'm afraid I'm not very good at arithmetic... ...but, well, I should think $20,000 would do it. At least for now. [BOTH CHUCKLING] I think the banks open at 9:30 in the morning. You're all right. Quite a woman, you know. Let's not lose our heads, Mr. Harkley. What Paris doesn't know, you'll teach it. Now, listen. Killing you means nothing, understand? I've got every reason to kill you and I will, unless you tell me where you put that gun. Well? - I put it in a bag and checked it. - Where? - Trinity Station. - When did you check it? This evening. All right, get me the check. SMERRLING: Water. Wa... [DOORBELL RINGING] [BIRD SCREECHING] [KNOCKING] GRACE: Mrs. Smerrling? Mrs. Smerrling? [CAR PULLING UP] PETER: Just wait here while I go in with Miss Elcott. - Huh, Tim? SHARKEY: Right. [SCREAMS] GRACE: There was a man. He rushed right by me. She's lying on the floor. PETER: Get in the car, Tim. [TIRES SCREECHING] - He turned into that one-way street. - Yeah. Well, that does it. We've lost him. SHARKEY: I'd better radio in. - Get the license? PETER: Of course not. Lights were off. - Can you describe the car? The man? - No. No. - Well, why radio in? Let's get back. SHARKEY: Sorry, forget it. OFFICER: Uh-oh. PETER: Park it, will you? JACKIE: It's Mrs. Smerrling. Somebody tried to kill her. GRACE: Did you get the man who ran? Better not move her. Take the ambulance back. I'll stay. PARAMEDIC: Okay, doctor. Excuse me. - Will I get to talk to her? - No, not now. GRACE: I got here a few minutes before you, lieutenant. - I wanted to talk Mrs. Smerrling. - About? - About my husband... - You sure it wasn't about the gun? - What gun? - The one your husband used. - I've told... - All right, all right. - You came to see her. Then? - I knocked at the door. - Somebody pulled me in and ran out. - And you didn't see. - All I know, it was a man. - Which isn't enough. - Did you touch any of these things? - No. We started to take... - All right. SHARKEY: Okay, okay, it's all over. Go on back upstairs. Professor McAdoo, please. Hello, professor? I'm sorry to call you so late, but I'm afraid I need you. Yes, again. I know it's irregular... ...but could you come to 317 Bunker Street right away, please? Thank you. [BIRD CHIRPING] Pete, this is for the Boston police. Get back to Barnstable. Pieces of my case are here too. The answer must be here. Can you shut that bird off, please? Who ran out of here? Why was he here? This person came here to kill her, but why? To get something? Maybe the gun. The gun we're looking for. The gun that goes with this clip Miss Elcott gave us. The gun that's going to send somebody to the electric chair. Did he get the gun, whoever he was? The answer to our case is right here, in this house, in this room. It started here. Maybe it will end here. I don't know. McAdoo will be here in a few minutes. [CLOCK CHIMING] Fingerprint boys have been here. Pictures have been taken. We've searched the whole place. What have we got? Nothing here. Room full of junk. [PHONE RINGING] PETER: I'll take it. Hello. Yeah, this is Moralas. When? I see. No, no. All right, thanks. DOCTOR: Gonna telephone the medical examiner. He can have her now. McADOO: She's dead. - So, what have we got? Well, we know one thing anyway... ...if whoever killed Miss Heldon did this, it couldn't have been Shanway. No? Being in jail's a pretty good alibi for this job. PETER: He's not in jail. That was Barnstable on the phone. Your favorite martyr escaped... ...while being questioned by a psychiatrist who was looking for a motive. The man who ran out of here wasn't my husband. I thought you said you didn't know who it was. You just happened to arrive here... ...at the right time to miss everything, remember? It's not possible that you came here to meet your husband. And nobody would even consider that you both did this. Nobody except me. That's better, Mrs. Shanway. When in doubt, start crying. Get your coat. And don't tell me to take it easy, doctor. When we bring in Shanway, we'll wash up the case. The whole mess. [BIRD CHIRPING] And good morning to you. - When did she show you that gun? - On my way to work, about 6 last night. This is stamped 7:45. "Trinity Station." Will you stay here, doctor? - Can we handle it ourselves? - Too much of a long shot to ask for help. What if he doesn't show up? If he does show, whoever he is, that's our man. - What time's the baggage room open? - Six o'clock. [WHISTLING] - Good morning. - Good morning. I've been waiting for you to open. My sister tagged her suitcase yesterday and she lost the check. You know how women are, always losing things. - She said you'd surely remember her. - Sorry. Against the rules. Well, it's awfully important to my sister. She had a slight accident last night and, uh... Well, do I look as though I'd steal a suitcase? Well, there's an awful lot of baggage here, mister. Can you describe the suitcase? Well, no, but I can describe my sister. She's medium height, red hair, very pretty hair... ...dressed rather peculiarly. Sometimes wore earrings. MAN: Red hair. Think this is it. You know, I could get fired for this. Well, you won't say anything about it and I certainly won't. - Thanks very much. MAN: You're welcome. - Tall. He had a brown hat and a light coat. - Okay. PETER: Down there, Tim. PETER: Go the other way. [THUDDING] I've been waiting to put these two together. - Take him in. - It's a pleasure. PETER: Now, Tim? - Yeah? Radio headquarters. If they spot Henry Shanway, don't shoot. - They'd be killing an innocent taxpayer. - Right. [PHONE RINGING] - McAdoo. PETER: Hello, professor? - This is Moralas. McADOO: Yeah. Mm-hm. - May I talk to Mrs. Shanway? - Sure. - Hello? - Mrs. Shanway. This is Lieutenant Moralas. - Yes, lieutenant. - We got our man. He showed up. Turned out to be a guy named Harkley. He's under arrest. Well, I guess that's about all... ...except I think your husband will be with you very soon now. And, Mrs. Shanway, I wanted to tell you that... Hello? Hello, Mrs. Shanway? [ENGLISH SDH]
